# Jordan could work some wizardry in Washington
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Once again, Michael Jor
dan downplayed the notion th.it lies planning a
comeback. C )nce again, he left the door one-tenth of a
percentage point open that it just might happen.
Responding to comments made by fellow Wash
ington Wizards owner Abe Pollin, the most authorita
tive source to date to give credence to the Jordan
comeback rumors, the five-time NBA M\ P told I he
Washington Post th.it his return is still very unlikely.
"1 haven't wavered one bit from what 1 ve been
saving," |ordan said in today s edition of the paper.
"If I had to answer today, I'm 99.9 percent sure I
won't play again."
"I'm not going to come back as a showpiece. I
wouldn't even think about it unless I thought I could
maintain the level of play I had when I left. 1 d only
come back doing everything I always did. And I m
nowhere near that, nowhere close to that. I haven t

played in three years.''
Jordan has denied the comeback rumors several
times over the past two months, but his latest statement
will do little to stop the speculation. Even some of his
friends, such .is golfing buddy and Pittsburgh Pen
guins star Mario Ixniieux, have not believed him.
l.cniicux, speaking yesterday after a Penguins
practice, said lie had talked to Jordan in the last 10
days and made it sound like His Airness was all but
ready to don the uniform.
"He's going to give it a shot and lie's working very
hard," Lemieux said. "He's taking his time, lie's tak
ing a few months to get ready, but I'm sure when lie
gets back, he'll be the best player again."
Jordan's denials have not Ix-en universally accept
ed in part because of the rather set retive manner lie
chooses to issue them, using one-on-one interviews
rather than a public forum.

But a denial to a larger audience would close the
door cntirelv, and perhaps that's something Jordan
doesn't want to do. His former Bulls coach, Phil Jack
son, said recently he thinks |ordan is contemplating a
comeback but hasn't made up bis mind.
"If lie's putting himself up against professional
plavers. I think lie's waiting to see what he feels like
when lie's out there," Jackson said. "I think he will
have a parachute in case he doesn't want to do it.in
case he feels like it's not worth it.in case he doesn't feel
he can play up to the level he wants to."
Jordan was the talk of the nation's capital yester
day, the day after Pollin went on television to reveal
his "gut feeling" that "the odds are that lie's going to
come back" and play for Washington next season.
