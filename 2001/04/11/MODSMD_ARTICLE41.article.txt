Dr. Barn Mvers of Duke I niversitv studied ati

NASCAR said vesterdax that Mvers' report
doesn't contradict anvthing the sanctioning both
lias said regarding the accident because it nevet
claimed the broken seat belt caused I arnhartlt s
tleatli.
"Since the Davtona 500, N \S( \R has made
t le.u that we will not suggest <>i speculate on the
circuinstances surrounding Dale Karnliardi's acci

I leltou s.ml in a statement.
"No one Ironi N ASCAR hasevei suggested w hat

Kat 'nhardt's tleatli but doesn't expect the icsiilts
until August.
I he panel is made up ol several different ex

and testing, sled and real 11 ash tests and impact

I lie review was announced on the same tla\

Mvei s presented his report to the Sentinel.
Myers, a professor ot biomedical engineering .it
Duke, was chosen to prepare the report as part of
.111 agreement between the Sentinel and Dale I - arn
liardt s widow, l eresa.
Mrs. Farnhardt successtnlly sued to have the au
t( »| >s\ photos sealed tour days after Farnhardt died
.it the DaMona 500 on Feb. IH. Ihe Sentinel
protested, saving it wanted its own medical expert
to view the photos foi an investigative series the
newspapei was writing on NASCAR safety.
I lie two suit s eventualh readied a settlement
that allowed Mvers to view the images, which
would then be sealed permanently.
Mvers was asked b\ the Sentinel to evaluate
whether Farnhardt's skull fracture resulted from
his head whipping forward, a blow on the top of
the head, 01 a broken se.it belt that allowed the dri
vei to strike Ins head on the steering wheel.
In Ins findings, Mvers sided with other racing
and medical experts who told the Sentinel that
larnhardt likelx died because Ins head and neck
were not held securely in place.
Farnhardt suffered eight broken ribs, a broken
breastbone and abrasions over the left hip and left
lower abdomen, indications that the seat belt func
tioned properh through much of the crash, hold
ing back Farnhardt's hod v. Mvers concluded.
What killed Farnhardt, Mvers concluded, was
the weight of his unrestrained head whipping for
ward hcvoud the abilit\ of Ins neck muscles to keep
it from snapping awav the base of the skull.
I he autops\ found that the underside of Farn
hardt's ( hin strut k and bent the steering wheel, a
blow that (oultl have been enough to cause a fatal
skull injurv. But the head whipping b\ itself would
have killed I arnhardt. Mvers s.iid.
\l\eis stopped short of'saving that better he.id
and-netk protection would have saved Farnhartlt.
But he said such ade\ it e had the potential to prevent
these injuries, which have claimetl the lives of as
main asfbui \AS( '.AR drivers in the past 1 I months.
"We'i c (ontlucting our own tletailetl re\ iew with
.1 team ot experts, this latest report will not change
that." I lelton said.
