## Photo manipulation complicates child pornography issue 
### ABIGAIL PHILLIPS 
Ihe Internet is but one ot tlit* technologies <>t the
day that has been implicated in the escalation ot the
child pornography industry. Congress has recently
targeted a second technology: digital imaging. Pro
grams like Adobe Photoshop can be — and are —
used to create "virtual child pornography; that is,
images that appear to be photographic representa
tions of children engaging in sexual acts but, in fact
depict no actual, living person.
With computer imaging, a fictitious child can be
"assembled" from multiple images — an ear here, an
arm there — so that the final image represents no
real person. ()r, through a process called morphing,
a photograph of a real person can be digitally trans
formed into a depiction of a child who does not exist.
To most people, child pornography is an abhor
rent idea. Not only is it morally offensive, but its pro
duction and distribution significantly harms chil
dren. As sue h, the U.S. Supreme Court has long held
that materials depicting real children engaged in
sexual acts are not protected under the First Amend
ment free speech guarantees; the government may
criminalize their possession and manufacture.
While we have numerous laws designed to suppress
the industry, its recent growth suggests their ineffec
tiveness. In an effort to curb the current rise in child
pornography, Congress passed the Child Pornogra
phy Prevention Act in 1996, extending the reach of
existing laws to criminalize the possession and distri
bution of child pornography.
I he new law expands the prohibitions on the dis
tribution and advertising of child porn to encompass
all visual depictions that "appear to be" or "convey
the impression" of child pornography. It also makes
illegal the act of misleading viewers into believing
they are looking at child porn, even if the uuli\ idual
shown is actually an adult.

In October, the Supreme Court will hear argu
ments on whether these additions to the law pass
muster under the First Amendment. While three

federal courts <>1 appeal
have upheld the constitu
tionality of the law as it
stands, a recent Ninth Cir
cuit Court of Appeals deci
sion in California ruled
that the amendments are
vague and overbroad and
thus are prohibited b\ First
Amendment guarantees.
First Amendment doc
trine states that "vague"
statutory language is pre
sumptively unconstitution
al because it permits too
much discretion on the part
of law enforcement and
leaves people uncertain ot
whether the\ mav be en
gaging in criminal activity.
Language that is "over
broad" is also forbidden lie
cause it extends to constitu
tionally permissible acti\ it v.

Indeed, the language of the 1990 act is imbued
with both of these problems. Now that even manu
factured images that do not depict real < hildren mav
be illegal, who is to say what images might come
within the bounds of the law? If an artist paints c hil
dren in sexual poses, is this an illegal act? What about
movies — like "American Heauty" or the 1997 ver
sion of "I.olita" — that include sexualh graphic
scenes in which a c hild is plaved b\ an adult? I liese
are representations of children engaged in sexual
acts that seem to lall within the st ope of the act.
In addition, it is possible that legalizing virtual

pornograpln might discourage use of real children
in manufacturing child pornography. Isn't this, at
bottom, what we really want to prevent? It's easy to

I
imagine that the avail
ability of a convenient
and often legal method
of producing child
pornography might in
duce many of its manu
facturers to abandon
the practice of employ
ing real children.
In defense, Con

the recent growth of the
child pornography in

poses .i clanger to chil

children who are the victims of the experience and
often suffer lasting psu hological effects from it.
I here are other reasons to believe that the new
law might be judicious. If synthetic images of child
pornograpln are not illegal, prosecutors will have

the difficult task of proving that images are of real

that many producers of child pornography who do
exploit real children w ill go 112 ree because of prosecu
tors' inability to produce enough evidence to show
that the images are real.

1999 when he flew to California tor a "sexual ren

Internet — only to discover she was a male FBI
agent. A Los Angeles jury later convicted Naughton
tot the possession of child pornography. Yet, follow

granted release on bail and a new trial. Depending
on the Supreme ('.ourt outcome next fall, he mav be
acquitted of the charges based on the absence of
proof that the child pornography in his possession
depicted ac tual children.
Furthermore, computer distortions don't neces
sarily mean a child iwisn't exploited in the production
of the image. Kven if a real c hild was photographed,
the images mav still be so digitally altered as to make
identification impossible. Again, except for the 1996
law, this would be impossible to show in court with
out substantial witness testimony. In essence, over
turning the act would impose a heavy burden of
proof on law enforcement; the government would be
forced to prove that a given sample of child pornog
raphy was not the product of digital manipulation.
I here is, of course, something to be said for the
argument that the compelling interest in impeding
the child pornography industry calls for broader
prohibitions, especially given the apparent ineffec

chosen the right path to this end is yet to be seen.

Ihe Internet is but one ot tlit* technologies <>t the
day that has been implicated in the escalation ot the
child pornography industry. Congress has recently
targeted a second technology: digital imaging. Pro
grams like Adobe Photoshop can be — and are —
used to create "virtual child pornography; that is,
images that appear to be photographic representa
tions of children engaging in sexual acts but, in fact
depict no actual, living person.
With computer imaging, a fictitious child can be
"assembled" from multiple images — an ear here, an
arm there — so that the final image represents no
real person. ()r, through a process called morphing,
a photograph of a real person can be digitally trans
formed into a depiction of a child who does not exist.
To most people, child pornography is an abhor
rent idea. Not only is it morally offensive, but its pro
duction and distribution significantly harms chil
dren. As sue h, the U.S. Supreme Court has long held
that materials depicting real children engaged in
sexual acts are not protected under the First Amend
ment free speech guarantees; the government may
criminalize their possession and manufacture.
While we have numerous laws designed to suppress
the industry, its recent growth suggests their ineffec
tiveness. In an effort to curb the current rise in child
pornography, Congress passed the Child Pornogra
phy Prevention Act in 1996, extending the reach of
existing laws to criminalize the possession and distri
bution of child pornography.
I he new law expands the prohibitions on the dis
tribution and advertising of child porn to encompass
all visual depictions that "appear to be" or "convey
the impression" of child pornography. It also makes
illegal the act of misleading viewers into believing
they are looking at child porn, even if the uuli\ idual
shown is actually an adult.

In October, the Supreme Court will hear argu
ments on whether these additions to the law pass
muster under the First Amendment. While three

federal courts <>1 appeal
have upheld the constitu
tionality of the law as it
stands, a recent Ninth Cir
cuit Court of Appeals deci
sion in California ruled
that the amendments are
vague and overbroad and
thus are prohibited b\ First
Amendment guarantees.
First Amendment doc
trine states that "vague"
statutory language is pre
sumptively unconstitution
al because it permits too
much discretion on the part
of law enforcement and
leaves people uncertain ot
whether the\ mav be en
gaging in criminal activity.
Language that is "over
broad" is also forbidden lie

tionally permissible acti\ it v.

Indeed, the language of the 1990 act is imbued
with both of these problems. Now that even manu
factured images that do not depict real < hildren mav
be illegal, who is to say what images might come
within the bounds of the law? If an artist paints c hil
dren in sexual poses, is this an illegal act? What about
movies — like "American Heauty" or the 1997 ver
sion of "I.olita" — that include sexualh graphic
scenes in which a c hild is plaved b\ an adult? I liese
are representations of children engaged in sexual
acts that seem to lall within the st ope of the act.
In addition, it is possible that legalizing virtual

pornograpln might discourage use of real children
in manufacturing child pornography. Isn't this, at
