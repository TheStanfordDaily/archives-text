# Stem cells may aid heart attack victims
## 
### JULIEN CAPERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons have used human stem
cells to treat rats who suffered heart attacks. Their
findings, reported in the April 1 issue of Nature
Medicine, may be applicable to human heart attack
victims in the not so distant future.

After a heart at
tack, remaining
cells grow in size to
try and take on the
function of the cells
killed during the
heart attack, a
process known as
compensatory hy
pertrophy. The
problem is that the
heart cannot estab
lish the necessary
network of blood
vessels to feed
these cells. So, as

the cells expand, the oxygen requirement of the
heart increases, but no blood cells exist to supply
the oxygen.
The researchers, however, discovered a type of
stem cell in human bone marrow that promotes an
giogenesis: the formation of new blood vessels. Re
searchers first induced heart attacks in the rats,
then injected the stem cells into the rats' tails. 1 he
stem cells found their way to the damaged heart tis
sue, because receptors on the cells bind to chemo
tactic ligands emitted b\ the damaged heart tissue.
Researchers found that 30 percent to 10 percent
of the rats showed marked signs of improvement in
heart function compared to those that did not re
ceive the treatment. There are still a few issues to be
worked out before human trials can begin, howev
er. The time frame in which the treatment has to
begin has vet to be determined. I his may be prob
lematic because the production of the stem (ells is a
slow process and the cells may not be available when
necessary. Nonetheless, the procedure has tremen
dous potential for the treatment of heart attacks.
A press release from UC San Diego reveals excit
ing information about the use of silicon chips to
keep liver cells alive. Bioengineers and chemists col
laborated on a project to use electrochemical etch
ing to make tiny wells in a silicon chip that can hold
growing liver cells while monitoring the tempera
ture and chemical environment (data necessary to
keep the fickle cells alive).
The researchers are trying to recreate the condi
tions necessary fora group of cells to work together
and function as an organ. If they are successful, this

artificial organ could be used to keep patients alive
until a transplant organ is available or, in a best case
scenario, until the liver recovers on its own. Other
potential benefits of an artificial liver include the
possibility of testing new drugs on the organ before
the drug is introduced to patients. Hie liver is verv
active in breaking down toxic chemicals in the bodv,
so an artificial liver would be an important step to
ward increased drug testing effic acv.

According to the April I issue of New Scientist
magazine, researchers from Johns Hopkins I'ni
versitv has developed a weekly pill that mav help
prevent cancer before it starts. The drug, "oltipraz,"
is currently being tested in (ihina, where as many .is
one in 10 adults die from liver cant er.
Oltipraz stimulates production of glutathione S
transfera.se, which helps neutralize certain carcino
gens like benzene. The drug "neutralizes" the car
cinogens by tying up the cancer-causing com
pounds before they can damage DNA — damage
that is integral to cancer formation. Specifically, re
searchers believe oltipraz could help neutralize a
chemical called aflatoxin found in grain and rice
and considered to be responsible for the high
amounts of liver cancer in China.
Those patients who took the medication excret
ed over twice as much "neutralized" aflatoxin in
their urine than those patients who were only on a
placebo treatment. Tests with smokers are planned
to see if the drug has an effect on lung cancer. ()ther
avenues researchers are exploring include attempt
ing to genetically engineer vegetables to express
higher amounts of glutathione Stransferase, al
ready' found in minute quantities in vegetables like
brussel sprouts and broccoli, thus eliminating the
need for the weekly pill.
