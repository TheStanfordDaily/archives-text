This article will kn k off a series about psychological
well-being brought to \ou by staffers at The Bridge Peer
Counseling ('.enter. Our aim is to provide concise infor
mation about mental health that is relevant to the Stanford
community, particularly students. Many profile at Stan-

om struggle to
be llii' paragon of
perfection, but
the /art is that
many of lis (me
personal issues
that are difficult
to /are without
the help of others.
I'lie purpose of
science is to ad
vance humanity,
and the science of
mental health
strives to do the
same.

Grief is a concept so nebulous that, even in the
realm of psychology, it is In definition vague and
unique to each individual. To be sure, the grieving
period usualh follows the death of someone dose lo
the griever. but death is not a necessary ingredient
in the recipe; am loss of something subjectively ex
perienced bv the griever .is significant can prompt a
grieving period. For example, it is understandable
to mourn at the end of a relationship or the de
struction of an heirloom.
Grief'is different for everyone. It seems obvious,
then, that "anything goes" when it comes to mourn
ing. Unfortunately, being accepting of individual
differences in grieving is easier said than done. It
can be very hard to allow yourself to express what
ever feelings you may encounter when grieving.
Keep that in mind as you experience grief yourself
or have friends who are grieving. A supportive per
son will be accepting of any way the griever chooses
to mourn.
Although there are myriad ways to grieve, there
are a few common stages. In the 19605, Dr. F.liza
betli kiiblcr-Ross conducted a series of ground
breaking studies on terminally ill patients and their
families. What resulted was her DAB l)A model of
grief, summed up in her 1969 book, "On Death
and Dying."
According to Kubler-Ross, the five stages of
grieving are denial, anger, bargaining, depression
and acceptance. More recently, critics like Dr.
Michele Chaban have taken objection to Kiibler-
Ross's model because of its rigiditv; how can every
one go through the same intricate stages? Despite
continuing debate about the exact stages of grief,
most researchers agree on at least three general

phases: denial, anger and acceptance.
Initially, many people experience denial of the
loss. Particularly in the case of sudden loss, denial
makes sense because it provides an easy way to es
cape the sudden rush of emotions. This phase is
characterized by the literal denial of the loss and
complete inattention to any emotions the griever

may feel.
The next
phase is
anger. When
the griever
starts to
come to
terms with
the loss, he
or she may
try to find a
cause for it.
So met imes
the cause
i (1 en t if ie (1
will be the

griever himself or even the deceased person. In any
case, the angry griever engages in a futile battle to
change the past by examining the chain of causation
and trying to change it. The anger stage is where
the griever begins to let himself experience emo
tions around the loss while not fully ready to accept
it.
Finally, the griever will achieve acceptance of the
loss. In this stage, the griever both fully under
stands that the loss has occurred and accepts that
nothing is going to change that fact.
Another common theme of most grieving is
that it takes a long time. A grieving period of five
or six years is not unusual after the loss of a par
ent or sibling. Regardless of the magnitude of the
loss, there is no set length of time for the grieving
process; it may be as quick or as long as the griev
er feels necessary.
So how does this all apply to you? I lere are a few
lips about grieving a loss at Stanford. First, remem
ber that everyone has his or her own way of griev
ing, so don't feel guilty or ashamed if you're not
crying, not feeling depressed or keep returning to
work. Counseling and Psychological Services direc
tor Alejandro Martinez said, "[Students should] not
become judgmental of their feelings (e.g. not feel
ing sad enough, feeling relief rather than grief, feel
ing nothing) but instead accept them and work to
ward understanding them."
Needless to sav, Stanford students feel tremen
dous pressure to perform academically under
stress, and grieving is no exception. It is perfectly
acceptable to continue with work and grieve at your
own pace. Returning to your normal life is part of

I lie |)li M'CSS.
I li.it brings me lo another
point: I ake \<>ur time. II vou en
i onnterecl .1 loss during the quar
tet and didn't want to tail ( lasses,
one strategy would hi- to c liannel
voui feelings toward schoolwork
.md set .iside some time to grieve
later, uninterrupted Irom dailv
pressures. Lvcn if vou decide to
lace voui feelings immediately,
allow yourself plent\ of lime. Let
tlu- grieving process run its nat
-111 al (ourse lot as long as it takes.
l inallv, don't forget to take
c are 0! voui self. Often we will
get so involved 111 our emotions
0! griel foi a loss that we'll lose
touch with things like hunger or
hvgiene. It doesn't make you a
bad or vain person to brush
\our teeth or comb voui hair
w bile grieving.
\n<l how does one best support
a bereaved friend? The most im
portant thing is to bear in mind
tli.it everyone grieves differently.
Some people w ill < r\ lot da\ s, otli
eis won't shed .1 tear. Still others
will watch baseball foi 7 I J hours
straight. I bet e is no u rotig way to
gt ieve a loss. 1 )on't be judgmental
ola friend il he isn't grieving in
what you think is the "traditional"
wav. 11 \ to support whatever
manner of griev ing your friends
mav choose.

Another crucial point to re
member is tlie timeline of gric\ 11 ijh.
I he first stage is tvpicalU denial, in
which few emotions are exposed.
I he bulk of the difficult grieving
comes in the latter stages of the
process with anger and moving
into .11 (eptance. In our c ulture,
most of the support foi bereaved
persons comes al the vcr\ begin
ning of the process, surrounding
the funeral. I nfortunatelv, this
falls into the denial stage when the
least support is actualK needed.
Friends will re.ilK need \ou six to
12 months down the road as thev
move into the angei and accep
tance stages of mourning.
During those latter stages,
don't be afraid to approach
friends about their grieving. II
the\ are still grieving a loss, the\
will be thinking about the loss: it is
not as if vou w ill somehow remind
them of their loss In bringing it
up. ()n the com ran, In discussing
the loss with tliein, vou show voui
concern, acceptance and support.
(iricvers c an also find comfort
111 the grieving process itself. In
bis cssav, " Ihe Solace of Pat
terns." researcher and Stanford
biologic al Sciences and Neurolo
g\ Prof. Robert Sapolsk\ writes,
"In .111 entropic world, we can
take a common comfort from our
common patterns, and there is
often consolation 111 attributing
su< h matters to forces larger than
ourselves."
