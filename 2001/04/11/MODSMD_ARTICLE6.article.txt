# Alternative to Bookstore cuts costs

### SANDRA UPSON EDITORIAL STAFF 
List week, juniors Nikhil Bhatla and
ftmlin ()u launched bookshare.stan
ford.edu, a system that helps students ac
quire books for their classes tor free
through an online borrowing service.
I he service, which is based on a net
work of undergraduates who are re
quired to lend at least one of their own
textbooks in order to be able to borrow a
book for any of their ( lasses, has met with
substantial success in its inaugural week.
"We've had about 200 users and 230
books. We've had close to 000 visits."
Bhatla said.
Though he claims to Ik- happv with
these numbers, the number of successful
shares is closer to 60. He and C)u agree
that the service will need many more stu
dents to sign up and lend lxx>ks in order
to reach its full potential.
"At the moment, we just need more
people," said junior David Salinas, who
helped Bhatla and C)u publicize the
launch of the service. "It grows with use

fulness as more people get involved."
Hie idea was a result of Bhatla and
()u's mutual frustration with the prices
charged by the Stanford Bookstore for
class textbooks.
"The vision [of Bookshare] is th.it the
Bookstore would become obsolete, ex
cept to serve as a vendor of new editions.
Of course, we're nowhere close to th.it
right now. This was a test run.and it
seemed like a success. We've gotten good
feedback from our users." Bhatla said.
While Bhatla and Ou were trying to
think of ways they could get around using
the Bookstore, they came up with the
idea of using a sharing service as a more
cost-efficient way of Obtaining lx>oks.
"We were comparing it toother things
we'd seen, like Napster, and we drew a

parallel." Ou said. "From the get-go, we
wanted to make this free. I like to think
we're doing this completelv out of spite
for the Bookstore."
Another Stanford-based online text
book source, SUAuction.com, also com
petes to beat the Bookstore. SI Auction is
set up as .i miniature version of e√üay
geared toward college students. It not
only provides textbooks, but also auctions
off other products such as couches and
computers.
Bhatla said, "SUAuction is profit
based and they don't even appear to be
doing vcia well; they have only 61 l)ooks
being auctioned right now."
According to Salinas, past book ser
vices seem to have tailed once students re
alized that these services are making a
profit on each sale.
"We had to aim tor a community shar
ing ideal because, when money Ixvomes
involved, people tend to get suspicious,"
Ou said.
"We're not trving to make a buck out

of this.... We're jus! trving to help stu
dents out," Salinas said.
Bhatla and ( hi plan to expand the ser
vice next year to include a rating system
for student lenders and borrowers, in
order to curb and discourage am abuse of
the system.
In addition, tliev plan to broaden the

range of hook availabilitx In expanding it to
include more students.
"Right now. it's oul\ for undergrad i Kiss
es. and we're thinking of extending it to in
clude the [(Graduate S( hool of Business]
.iiul the 1 .aw S( hool," Bhatl.i said.
So tar, thcv have received positive re
views from students who have been able to
procure several ot their c lasses' books.
"There's no point in having books just
sitting on vour shelves. It is an opportunit\
to share and to benefit vourselt as well."
Bhatla said.
