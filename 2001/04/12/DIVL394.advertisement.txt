Give It Once, It's a Nice Gift.
Give It Every Year and It's a Nice Education.
Lefs face it Most gifts end up in the trash. But U.S. Savings Bonds are gifts with a future. And when you give
them every year, they can make a real dent in someone's college bills. With eight denominations to choose from,
you can decide how large you want that dent to be. So whether you choose the popular Series EE Bonds or the
inflation-protected I Bonds, your gift will continue to grow for years to co."ie. And when it's needed, it'll be there,
safe, sound, and more valuable than ever.
Savings Bonds can be purchased through most local banks, where
you work, or automatically through the new Savings Bonds
