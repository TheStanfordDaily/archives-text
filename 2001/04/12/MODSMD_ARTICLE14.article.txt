1966
On April 12, 1900, Ihe l)ail\ printed a farcical
Letter to tlu- Lditor about temperance.
"Pandemonium reigns free on the Stanford tain
pus. fhe time has tome tor the Stanfbrtlians for
Honor, lntegrit\ and Temperance to speak out.
Needless tosav, we unabashed "prims' are alarmed In
the recent proposal to libcrali/e campus lit|Uor laws.
"Discontinue the sale of lMavbo\ and other such
obnoxities .it the I residtler drugstore. 1 he reason
for this is self-evident to all who treasure Simple
Honor, lntegrit\ and Temperance.
"Strengthen girls' social regulations. We advocate
a 9:30 p.m. curfew for underclassmen and a 10
o'tiot k curfew for seniors. I best- rathei liberal hours
could be extended if the girls were accompanied by
a competent adult woman."
Bottom line: And you thought the Tres-XXX of this year's Big
Game Gaieties was a joke.
