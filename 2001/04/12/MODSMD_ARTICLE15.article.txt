## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Mumia Abu-Jamal may have one more
chance at lite, and a new student group at
Stanford is determined to do what it can to
help him get it.
As the davs tick away before the hearing
that will decide the famous Philadelphian's
fate, a group of Stanford students is joining
the fray in an attempt to raise awareness
about his case. Sophomore Brent Schulkin es
tablished MAJESTIC. —or Mumia Abu-
Jamal's Emancipative Stanford l eam Investi
gating Change — after watching a documen
tary about Jamai s case at Enchanted Broccoli
Forest.
Jamal, a former Black Panther and chair of
the Philadelphia Association of Black Jour
nalists, was sentenced to death in 1982 for al
legedly shooting police officer Damn Faulkn
er. His supporters, who include such promi
nent figures as Mava Angelou, Susan Saran
don and the rock group Rage Against the Ma
chine, contend that he received an unfair trial
and was sentenced to death because of his po
litical beliefs, not because he ac tuallv commit
ted the crime.
In Ma\ or June, a hearing that Schulkin
describes as "basic alh his last chance" will de
termine whether Jamal will receive a new trial
or be executed.
Schulkin decided to get involved after
speaking with Jeff Mac kler, the national coor
dinator tor the Mobilization to free Mumia,
following the screening at EBE.

"1 thought it was an issue that was very im
portant hut not very well known on campus,"
Schulkin said. "1 ran the idea by some friends
to see it the\ wanted to get involved, and we
ended up starting MAJESTIC."
The group's main task so tar has been cre
ating and maintaining its Web site, http: ma
jestic.stanford.edu. The site outlines the
group's beliefs and provides links to a plethora
of resources on Jamal, including some sites
that call for his execution.
"We discourage anyone from blindly
agreeing with us." the site's main page says.
"Our beliefs would be worthless if we hadn't
considered both sides of the story."
MAJESTIC, members say thev hope to ex
pose Stanford community members to the
facts of the case and to let them make up their
own minds about whether to get involved.
"It's important for people to be aware of
Mumia and his history because . . . his case
embodies the tlaws and inconsistencies about
the American legal system," said junior Sierra
Martinez, MAJESTIC's financial officer.
"Evervbodv who values justice should be
aware of Mumia's case."
Schulkin said that about 50 people had
signed up for the MAJESTIC mailing list,
which has been the focus of the group so far.
I'he group has only met once since it formed
earlier this year, but communication via the
list has allowed members to begin working on
a project that could become a large, campus
wide event.
"We're working on putting together a
Mumia education forum on either May 8 or

9." Schulkin said. He said thai the event could
feature a debate, speaking engagements b\
Mackler and Pam Africa of MOVE (a
Philadelphia revolutionary group) and a
West Coast premier screening of the docu
mentary "Voice of the Voiceless." Other
celebrities connected with the case might also
speak if MAJESTIC, succeeds in its fundrais
ing efforts.
"We're planning to get funds from the
ASSI Martinez, said. "1 have been involved
in the planning ot the conference, and 1 ex
pect ,i great event to come of it."
The forum could also include collabora
tion with other student groups to bring to
light some cases of racial and political injus
tice besides that of Jamal.
Of course, not evervone believes Jamai s
execution would be unjust. The Fraternal
Order of Police maintains a Web site dedicat
ed to debunking mvths about the case and
honoring the memory of Faulkner. His
widow, Maureen Faulkner, actively cam
paigns for |amal's execution and protests the
fact that tlu- man convicted of killing her hus
band has become a worldwide celebrity and a
hero to his supporters.
Gilbert Gallegos, president of the order,
has called Jamal a "poster child of those liber
al fringe groups who disrespect police officers
and oppose the death penalty."
Schulkin said he hopes that MAJESTIC
can help discredit this notion by showing that
many of Jamai s supporters are not mere rad
ical activists, but thoughtful, concerned c iti
zens who believe in remedying injustice.
