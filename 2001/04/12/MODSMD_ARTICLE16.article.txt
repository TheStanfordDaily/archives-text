# Stanford chemists honored by society
## Nonprofit organization recognizes groundbreaking work, service of profs 
### TRISHA OKUBO 
I luce Stanford chemists were honored bv
the American ('.hemic al Society last week at the
nonprofit organization's 2 4 J1 st national meeting
m San Diego.
John Ross received the Peter Debve Award 111
Physical C'.lieniistn for his contributions, both
theoretical and experimental, to the- under
standing of complex systems. Kdward 1.
Solomon accepted the society's Award in Inor
ganic (.hemistrv for his work with inorganic
spectroscop\ and physical inorganic c heinistrv.
And tor bis outstanding commitment to public
service as a member of the s<x ietv. Richard Zarc
received the Charles Parsons Award.

As the Camille and Henry Dreyfus professor
ol cheinistrv. Ross has been contributing to the
study of complex systems tor the past M) years.
He broke new scientific ground by inventing a
radically new and powerful approach to the
study of complex reactions, which include bio
( hemical processes in living organisms.
His breakthrough idea was to analyze com
plex systems In applying inputs and correlating
them with measured outputs, instead of looking
at individual components of a system.
"I look at complex systems in the same way
.111 electric al engineer looks at .1 black box," Ross
said. "A chemist t\ picallv hacks up a system and
studies it one element at a time. An engineer
looks ,u inputs and outputs and from that de
termines logic gates and functions."
Ac cording to Ross, a holistic view of systems is
necessary because important interactions —
such as feedback mechanisms and enzymes —
mav be overlooked in the piecemeal approach.
Ross's team took theory and made it reality

when studying glycolysis, the process that the
body uses to break down sugars to vield energy .
The study, which determined the connections
between 12 c hemical species in .1 stage of glycol
ysis, would have taken years of research in the
past. With Ross's methods, however, the entire
process took only four months.
Further applications for Ross's approach in
volve the characterization of genes and
their corresponding protein products,
called genomics and proteomics, respec
tively. Because researchers work with so
many species at the same time, Ross's ap
proach is considered superior.
Ross's work also facilitates the studying of bi
ological processes in cells. "When vou go deep
er into the cell, it gets increasingly complex,"
which necessitates the need fora holistic ap
proac, Ross said.
