lence, Palestinian officials said, hours after
Israeli tanks rumbled into a refugee camp
and reduced a neighborlrood to rubble —
tlu- first such tbra\ into Palestinian territo
ry during seven months of violence.
1 he I .S. administration is reluctant to
help broker peace talks before violence
ends, but I .S. mediators stepped in after
the latest flare-up to arrange the meeting
between Israeli and Palestinian securit\
commanders, with the participation of
I ! .S. diplomats and ('.IA officials.
1 he Palestinians initially said thev hesi
tated to attend the talks, following the ls
raeli assault with tanks and bulldozers on a
neighborhood in the Khan Yunis refugee

camp in the (iaza Strip. Israel s.iid the pre
dawn raid was in response to mortar tire.
I wo Palestinians were killed, more
than two dozen wounded and 'JO
homes razed or heavily damaged in
the raid that left hundreds home
less. according to Palestinian offi
cials. The Israeli troops came under
heavy return tire, witnesses said.
At davbreak. two camp residents with
hoes tore into the rubble, retrieving blan
kets ,m(l pillows, while a woman collected
pots and pans. Nine-vear-old ()sania I las
souneh pic ked up the pieces of a red tire
engine that he said was a gift from his fa
ther and his onl\ toy.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat or
dered 10 houses being built in the refugee
c amp turned over to homeless families, his

office said.
Israeli Defense Minister Binvaniin
Ben-Eliezer said th.it despite the night
time incursion, he had no plans to reoccu
pv areas of the Ciaza Strip 112 rom which Is
raeli troops withdrew in 1994 as part of in
terim peace agreements.
Ben-Eliezer said troops attacked an
area of Khan Yunis from which mortar
shells were tired at Jewish settlements.
"These are points we don't want the Pales
tinians to return to," Ben-Eliezer told Is
rael radio. "This is a clear act of defense."
Israel sa\s Palestinians have fired more
than 50 mortar shells at Ciaza settlements
in recent davs.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker said the I nited
States opposed incursions intoor fire from

Palestinian territories.
"Obviously, mortal attacks from one
side and bulldozing of Palestinian homes
b\ the other undermine the conduct of se
rious, successful discussions," he said.
Yesterday evening, Palestinians tired
four mortar shells toward the Nissanit set
tlement in Ciaza and the Israeli village of
Netiv Haasara village just outside the
strip. ()ne house was damaged.
In response. Israeli fired tank shells at a
Palestinian border police position near the
Ciaza town of Beit Hanoun, the army said.
A convoy of U.S. cars trying to enter Ciaza
to pick up the Palestinian security com
manders was delayed by the exchange of
fire, Palestinian officials said.
As the meeting was in progress, Pales
tinians in I lebron opened tire on a Jewish

enclave there, drawing return Israeli
tire — a tank shell — that wounded six.
including three members of'an ambulance
crew, Palestinians said. The Israeli mili
tary said there was an exchange of fire but
110 tanks were involved, and soldiers did
not shoot .it an ambulance.
Israel has said mortar shells have been
fired from Palestinian security bases, a
claim denied by Palestinian Information
Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.
Abed Rabbo said the mortars were
launched by activists without tics to the
Palestinian Authority. "Whenever there is
such an incident (mortar fire) and we
know about it. we are trying to prevent it,
not encourage it," Abed Rabbo said.
He said mortar tire has come in re
sponse to Israeli raids.
