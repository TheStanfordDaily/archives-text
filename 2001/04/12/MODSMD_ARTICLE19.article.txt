### BRANDI YASUOKA 
In honor of their fraternity brother's
courage and inspiration in his battle with
cancer, past and present members of
Sigma Chi kick off the seventh annual
Bart J. McCormick Memorial Golf
Tournament April 10. The tournament
has raised over $100,000 for the Lucile
Packard (.hildren's 112 lospital .it Stanford
since its inception.
According to tournament coordina
tor and founder Gavin Turner, Class of
1990, the tournament's goals were "sev
eral-fold." Members of Sigma Chi
sought to "celebrate the life and memo
ry of our deceased friend, to honor his
family and to raise money in support of
pediatric cant er research."
Bart McCormick was diagnosed with
osteogenic sarcoma, a bone cancer that
started in his leg. in 1990. He postponed
coming to Stanford fora year after
learning the cancer had spread to his
lungs. Having battled the disease with
chemotherapy, femur and knee replace

merits, five lung surgeries and two bone
marrow transplants, he came to Stan
ford in 1993 and pledged Sigma Chi in
the spring of 1994. He died jnlv 20,
1994.
"1 only knew Bart for six months, but
he obviously had quite an impact on me
and those that he knew," Turner said.
"Shortly after 1 met Bart, he learned that
his condition was terminal. Watching
him attack lite and soak up all that he
could in those remaining months was in
credibly inspirational to me."
"This tournament is a cool example
of brotherhood and closeness. It shows
that people can make a lasting impres
sion on others' lives," said senior Rom
ahlo Wilson, undergraduate coordina
tor of the event. "Having only known
Bart for such a short time and starting an
event like this [in his honor] shows that
he had a huge impact on his pledge
brothers."
Despite his long battle with
cancer and learning his disease
was terminal, McCormick was

known by his zeal for life.
A booklet advertising the event
quotes from McCormick's journal: "Life
is tilled with strong emotions, and 1 see it
as mv duty to fill others' lives with strong
emotions of happiness. What else do we
exist for but to make each other happy?
l he twist 1 have found in this equation is
the only way to make happy is to be
happv. It all comes from within."
It is in this spirit that Sigma Chis say
ilie tournament will take place this year
at the Stanford Coif Course. Participants
are thing in from around the countrv
and world to plav, with friends and rela
tives coming from Seattle, New York
and London.
