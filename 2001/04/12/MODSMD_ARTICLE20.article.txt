						Stanford Daily University response to hate graffiti inadequate

Published Since INVI

Tl IK lIAIi. CRAITI I I found scribbled
in Buildings 200 and 50 and in Meyer
Library last week sent an understand
ahl\ disturbing wake-up call lo I niver
sit\-I.it ullv, stall and students. Indeed, the inflam
matory remarks — including "rape all Asian
hitches and dump them and nuke Hiroshi
ma"— written In an as-vet-unidentified person
were shocking and e\'en frightening. But the I ni
\'ersitv has gone too far in hiding these words in
.m attempt to protect students. Lven I he Stan
lord Daily did not initialK recognize the incident
l< >r what it was — a rat ist <nul sexist crime.
I Diversity President John 1 lennessv. the Stan
ford Police antl Ihe l)ail\ should have adtlressetl
the actual content of the messages. 1 he I niversitv
must he moreproat tivein its reat lion totlieint ident
i at her than attempting to push the details under'the
rug. It is as important to create an open dialogue in
this situation as it is to lind the perpetrator.

(lt Hist rut tive dialogue would recognize that, not
only do the messages denigrate specific ethnic
groups, thev are part it ulan horrifying because they
advocate violence against women. Because racism is
so glaringly taboo, it tends to overshadow sexism.
Such was the case with the graffiti. The Stanford com
munity must respond to the gralliti s double attack.
Furthermore, the recent graffiti is onh the latest
crime involving rat e; .is recent 1\ as HHHi, similar hate
remarks were found in the Asian American Activities
Center. Because crimes like this do occur, I niversitv
administrators must make even effort not onl\ to pun
ish the ollenders when the\ strike, but also to use the
opportune to increase communication on campus.
II ignorance is the fundamental cause of such
( rimes, and education is the i lire fot ignorance,
then everyone should be made aware of the graf
fiti content to avoid future incidents. Second, the
I niversitv should activeh address the miscon
ception— whether it concerns a culture, a

group or an idea. So far, this has not happened.
Int leasing awareness oft lie racist act is definitely
possible, considering the vast resources of the cam
pus community centers and residences. In this case,
ethnic theme dormitories and the Women's Center,
for example, should offer programming to educate
students. We applaud Okada House for holding a
dialogue about the incident last night. Though dor
mitories and community centers are the most visible
organizers of outreach, the University has a duty to
lead and support their efforts. In the weeks since the
int ident, the I diversity has not upheld its responsi
bility. Hi.it there is still a large number of people who
do not know w hat happened is disturbing.
1 "he fact that a few University administrators
and campus police are speaking out against
Communication Prof. Laura Leets is perturbing
as well. I.eets posted photographs of the graffiti
online as part of her bate speech research. Ac
cording to the San Francisco Chronicle ("Stan-

ford cop takes issue with professor's hate poll,
April 4), administrators — including Sgt. Rick
Tipton of the Stanford Police and Vice Provost
for Campus Relations LaDoris Cordell — pre
ferred tocover up the content in order to protect
members of targeted groups.
Covering up hate speech is unacceptable and
damaging. Yes, racist graffiti is hurtful. Yes, the
words may make people upset. But how is it possi
ble to combat ignorance when the officials involved
don't even want to acknowledge it? Leets's survey
will assist in the healing process that must take
place after such a deeply personal crime. I he I ni
versity should support and nurture her project.
In trving to prevent students and faculty from
potential harm, the University is paving the path
for such harm to occur again. The I niversity
should utilize this disturbing incident for the the
benefit of the community by focusing on the great
potential for education and outreach efforts.
