Personalities aren't somehow "intrin

side everv frog 1111 ks a priiue. Personalis
— what's inside — is formed b\ repeated
interaction with other people. And guess
what — looks factor into that set of inter
actions. Other people treat vou on the
basis of how vou look. That means good
looking people tend to be more confident,
less inset me and have higher self-esteem.
There's <1 high correlation between good
looks and good personalities.
When prett\ bo\ sand girls tell you that

Beauty has no disadvantages. lake the
usual observation that good-looking
women (or men) face subtle discrimination
at work, when colleagues attribute their
ac bievements to looks rather than abilities.

Its not as 11 we think. "Whoa, she's uglv.
so she must be cxtrenich » apable!"
While it's true that we tend to assume that
the beautiful aren't "really" capable, we
don't assume that the ugh are automat it all\

Despite the insistence ol those post
modern leftists w ho hang around Builtl

tant, not because there's some weird

I ake your average babv. So cute, so
cuddly, so awww-inspiring. And with

II you're a i loset Discovery Channel nerd
like me, you'll know that animals select mates

cles or big horns are signs of gtnxl genetic ma

I Ins biological basis to gtwul looks ex
plains why people of all cultures and all
sexes value beautv highly. I ransvestites
and transsexuals from around the world
compete in Tiffany's annual Queen of the
Universe Pageant. I.ike the other two, the
third sex also needs a platform to display
good looks.
Give in to the deep demands ot your
genes. Go ahead—be shallow, (.o for
looks. Resistance is futile. 'Cause vou and
me. babv. ain't nuthin'but mammals.
