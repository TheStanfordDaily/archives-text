Criticism of Long 'misguided'
As .1 tiu nit\ memhei in the humanities
.md member ol ilu- select inn committee
tot the new dean <>t the School ot Hu
manities and S( iences. 1 must take excep
tion to some ot the \ iews expressed in the
vesterda\'s editorial ("New dean choice
raises red 11 tor humanities").
I he selection ot Biological Sciences
l'rof. Sharon Long .is the new dean was
the result ola painstaking process in
which .i committee ol nearly 20 members
ot the lac ult\. stall and student body ded
icated considerable time and energy to
examining the overall challenges faced
bv the school and to scouring the Uni
versity tor strong, capable and experi
enced candidates.
1 'lie humanities disciplines were very
well represented on the committee and, far
more often than not. the views of represen
tatives from the sciences, social sciences
and humanities were in perfect harmony.
In its deliberations, the committee explicit
ly considered the potential symbolism of
recommending the appointment of a new
dean from the humanities, and, indeed,
several prominent colleagues from within
the tolcl ot the humanities were on its final
short list.
Yet, in matters as crucial as the future
leadership of the largest school in the I ni
versitv, considerations of quality and lead
ership potential must necessarily t.ike
precedence over issues ot disc iplinary rep
resentation. From this standpoint. Long

emerged right from the start as one of the
outstanding candidates under considera
tion, and, in my view (and that of the com
mittee), the University should consider it
self fortunate indeed that she has accepted
Provost John Etcheniendy's offer.
As The Dailv is no doubt aw are, I am a
strong opponent of the effort to create a
unified Modern Languages and Litera
tures Department — an effort that 1 view
as unworthy of a major research universi
ty and as a throwback to the outdated
modes of organization that Stanford dis
carded in the 19605. So, while 1 share I he
Daily's concern about the need for imagi
native. forward-looking leadership iti the
humanities, the emphasis in this case is
misguided.
1 would propose a different headline re
garding the appointment ot Long as
dean — namely, "Sharon Long appointed
as first femule dean of humanities and sci
ences in the history of Stanford Universi
ty." The event in question is one we should
all welcome and celebrate, not bemoan.

You cannot have it both ways. You dis
miss the fact that the provost is from the
humanities (philosophy) as unrelated to
his performance in office, hut assume, ap
parently without any communication
from her, that the behavior in office of the

new dean of Humanities and Sciences is
predetermined by the tact that slu- is from
the sciences (biology)- Would it not have
been more responsible (and also more in
teresting to all concerned — you, Biolog
ical Sciences Prof. Sharon Long, vour
readers), to have gone to the trouble of in
terviewing her before attacking her ap
pointment root and branch? You would
have found her to be .111 extraordinarilv
devoted and widely experienced Univer
sity citizen, as well as the brilliant scientist
you recognize her to be.
Ihe superficiality of your thinking
about the problems of the humanities is
indicated by your dismissal of the propos
al to combine the foreign language de
partments as being dictated bv "numbers
on a balance sheet." Language depart
ments everywhere live in a more or less
constant state of coming together and
breaking apart. When I came to Stanford
in the 19505, there was a single depart
ment of modern European languages
(Latin and Greek, being non-modern,
lived in the ('.lassies Department). Salva
tion is not guaranteed under any admin
istrative arrangement, but there's no rea
son to believe that bringing departments
together will necessarily diminish either
their effectiveness or their clout.

Daily could improve service
to campus groups
I am the editor chieftain tor The
Mind's Eye, and I would like to begin by
stating that 1 appreciate the service The
Daily provides through its special-tee en
dorsements. The majority of the com
ments are insightful, and 1 use them as a
means tor improvement. However, 1 too
have some constructive criticism to add
to the process.
Primarily, The Dailv does not famil
iarize iisell with the intricacies of student
groups and, therefore, is not making a
totalh informed analvsis. I invited my
self to the special-fee interview (a strange
situation, considering inv position) and
found il to be a formalitv. We were shut
tled in, blabbed in an unstructured man
ner for.i few minutes, then we were shut
tled out.
1 do not think I 'he Dailv is even aware
that completely new leadership has been
running I lie Mind's Kve since winter
quarter. I- urthei inoi e, there is one claim
I would like to clear up for evervone on
campus. 1 lie Mind's K\e receives nearly

300 submissions by at least 100 students
for each issue, and we run a completely
anonymous selection process that re
cently has tried to include the opinions
of professors as guest editors. If The
Daily was aware of these facts, would
they have still attacked how "exclusive"
we are?
More importantly, The Daily does not
have the right to make statements about
any group's lack of public ity. In her edi
torial ("Editor expresses concern about
ASSU's future," April 10), Nadira Hira
referenced a quotation that reads, "The
test of good journalism is the pleasure of
its public service." But, yet. The Daily has
forgotten a key of public service: They
critique organizations for not having
tremendous campus recognition without
making it easy for said organizations to
utilize the tremendous publicity of the
newspaper.
Should this letter be printed, it will be
the only time (other than special-fee en
dorsements) that I've seen The Mind's
Eye mentioned in a long time. Now, 1
have nothing against the Chaparral, but
they are mentioned constantly in The
Daily. Why not have a rotating column
that describes what's happening with
various student groups? Why not trans
form .ill those extra ads for The Daily
(which are really just tiller) into space
that student organizations could capital
ize on at little or no cost?
In conclusion, The Daily is doing a
wonderful public service, but its role

could be improved. Find out what's it-al
ly going on with student groups and
spread the word to the i est of ( ampus. I o
take a shot .it a shameless plug, let people
know about events like the ret ent unveil
ing oi another issue of I lie Mind's Eve,
or that we've got a brand new Web site
(http://www.stantortl.etln group iniiids
eye). Don't just respond dm ing the li\ pe
of elections; 1 lit- l).ul\ should help
fledgling organizations and those with
substantial histon In sharing informed

Daily could improve service
to campus groups
I am the editor chieftain tor The
Mind's Eye, and I would like to begin by
stating that 1 appreciate the service The
Daily provides through its special-tee en
dorsements. The majority of the com
ments are insightful, and 1 use them as a
means tor improvement. However, 1 too
have some constructive criticism to add
to the process.
Primarily, The Dailv does not famil
iarize iisell with the intricacies of student
groups and, therefore, is not making a
totalh informed analvsis. I invited my
self to the special-fee interview (a strange
situation, considering inv position) and
found il to be a formalitv. We were shut
tled in, blabbed in an unstructured man
ner for.i few minutes, then we were shut
tled out.
1 do not think I 'he Dailv is even aware
that completely new leadership has been
running I lie Mind's Kve since winter
quarter. I- urthei inoi e, there is one claim
I would like to clear up for evervone on
campus. 1 lie Mind's K\e receives nearly

300 submissions by at least 100 students
for each issue, and we run a completely
anonymous selection process that re
cently has tried to include the opinions
of professors as guest editors. If The
Daily was aware of these facts, would
they have still attacked how "exclusive"
we are?
More importantly, The Daily does not
have the right to make statements about
any group's lack of public ity. In her edi
torial ("Editor expresses concern about
ASSU's future," April 10), Nadira Hira
referenced a quotation that reads, "The
test of good journalism is the pleasure of
its public service." But, yet. The Daily has
forgotten a key of public service: They
critique organizations for not having
tremendous campus recognition without
making it easy for said organizations to
utilize the tremendous publicity of the
newspaper.
Should this letter be printed, it will be
the only time (other than special-fee en
dorsements) that I've seen The Mind's
Eye mentioned in a long time. Now, 1
have nothing against the Chaparral, but
they are mentioned constantly in The
Daily. Why not have a rotating column
that describes what's happening with
various student groups? Why not trans
form .ill those extra ads for The Daily
(which are really just tiller) into space
that student organizations could capital
ize on at little or no cost?
In conclusion, The Daily is doing a
wonderful public service, but its role

could be improved. Find out what's it-al
ly going on with student groups and
spread the word to the i est of ( ampus. I o
take a shot .it a shameless plug, let people
know about events like the ret ent unveil
ing oi another issue of I lie Mind's Eve,

tion to some ot the \ iews expressed in the
vesterda\'s editorial ("New dean choice
raises red 11 tor humanities").
I he selection ot Biological Sciences
l'rof. Sharon Long .is the new dean was
the result ola painstaking process in
which .i committee ol nearly 20 members
ot the lac ult\. stall and student body ded
icated considerable time and energy to
examining the overall challenges faced
bv the school and to scouring the Uni
versity tor strong, capable and experi
enced candidates.
1 'lie humanities disciplines were very
well represented on the committee and, far
more often than not. the views of represen
tatives from the sciences, social sciences
and humanities were in perfect harmony.
In its deliberations, the committee explicit
ly considered the potential symbolism of
recommending the appointment of a new
dean from the humanities, and, indeed,
several prominent colleagues from within
the tolcl ot the humanities were on its final
short list.
Yet, in matters as crucial as the future
leadership of the largest school in the I ni
versitv, considerations of quality and lead
ership potential must necessarily t.ike
precedence over issues ot disc iplinary rep
resentation. From this standpoint. Long

emerged right from the start as one of the
outstanding candidates under considera
tion, and, in my view (and that of the com
mittee), the University should consider it
self fortunate indeed that she has accepted
Provost John Etcheniendy's offer.
As The Dailv is no doubt aw are, I am a
strong opponent of the effort to create a
unified Modern Languages and Litera
tures Department — an effort that 1 view
as unworthy of a major research universi
ty and as a throwback to the outdated
modes of organization that Stanford dis
carded in the 19605. So, while 1 share I he
Daily's concern about the need for imagi
native. forward-looking leadership iti the
humanities, the emphasis in this case is
misguided.
1 would propose a different headline re
garding the appointment ot Long as
dean — namely, "Sharon Long appointed
as first femule dean of humanities and sci
ences in the history of Stanford Universi
ty." The event in question is one we should
all welcome and celebrate, not bemoan.

Editorial 'superficial'
You cannot have it both ways. You dis
miss the fact that the provost is from the
humanities (philosophy) as unrelated to
his performance in office, hut assume, ap
parently without any communication
from her, that the behavior in office of the

new dean of Humanities and Sciences is
predetermined by the tact that slu- is from
the sciences (biology)- Would it not have
been more responsible (and also more in
teresting to all concerned — you, Biolog
ical Sciences Prof. Sharon Long, vour
readers), to have gone to the trouble of in
terviewing her before attacking her ap
pointment root and branch? You would
have found her to be .111 extraordinarilv
devoted and widely experienced Univer
sity citizen, as well as the brilliant scientist
you recognize her to be.
Ihe superficiality of your thinking
about the problems of the humanities is
indicated by your dismissal of the propos
al to combine the foreign language de
partments as being dictated bv "numbers
on a balance sheet." Language depart
ments everywhere live in a more or less
constant state of coming together and
breaking apart. When I came to Stanford
in the 19505, there was a single depart
ment of modern European languages
(Latin and Greek, being non-modern,
lived in the ('.lassies Department). Salva
tion is not guaranteed under any admin
istrative arrangement, but there's no rea
son to believe that bringing departments
together will necessarily diminish either
their effectiveness or their clout.

GSC's 'hostility simmers
in ballot statement'
1 am disappointed that three mem
bers <>l the Graduate Student Council
have c hosen to use- an obst lire passage in
the ASSI Constitution to published on
the ballot a one-sided — and
inaccurate—hit piece against 1 he Stan
ford Daily.
The insertion ot a partisan rant In
CISC members, even il legal, into the
midst of what should be an impartial
voting process illustrates precisely
why Stanford students are so dismis
sive and cvnical toward theii student
government.
In addition, their choice of venue to
air their disagreements with The
Dail\ —where .i suitable rebuttal would
not be presented — suggests that they
fear that tliev could not win on the mer
its of their argument.
And they wouldn't.
I nder the leadership of Adam ke
me/is, l'herese Lee. m\self and other ed
itors in 1998, I he Daih championed the
cause of graduate student housing with
months ot generous coverage <>n its news
and editot ial pages. You can look it up.
But with the inc t eased coverage ot the

CiSC c ame increased scrutiny. When we
insisted that our news coverage relate
policy disagreements within the council
as well as its positive initiatives, and our
editorial page chose to oppose the 1999
ASSI ( onstitution creating a wholly un
structured Graduate Student Council,
some long-time GS(. activists became
disenchanted with the newspaper and
refused to talk to reporters.

Daily could improve service
to campus groups
I am the editor chieftain tor The
Mind's Eye, and I would like to begin by
stating that 1 appreciate the service The
Daily provides through its special-tee en
dorsements. The majority of the com
ments are insightful, and 1 use them as a
means tor improvement. However, 1 too
have some constructive criticism to add
to the process.
Primarily, The Dailv does not famil
iarize iisell with the intricacies of student
groups and, therefore, is not making a
totalh informed analvsis. I invited my
self to the special-fee interview (a strange
situation, considering inv position) and
found il to be a formalitv. We were shut
tled in, blabbed in an unstructured man
ner for.i few minutes, then we were shut
tled out.
1 do not think I 'he Dailv is even aware
that completely new leadership has been
running I lie Mind's Kve since winter
quarter. I- urthei inoi e, there is one claim
I would like to clear up for evervone on
campus. 1 lie Mind's K\e receives nearly

300 submissions by at least 100 students
for each issue, and we run a completely
anonymous selection process that re
cently has tried to include the opinions
of professors as guest editors. If The
Daily was aware of these facts, would
they have still attacked how "exclusive"
we are?
More importantly, The Daily does not
have the right to make statements about
any group's lack of public ity. In her edi
torial ("Editor expresses concern about
ASSU's future," April 10), Nadira Hira
referenced a quotation that reads, "The
test of good journalism is the pleasure of
its public service." But, yet. The Daily has
forgotten a key of public service: They
critique organizations for not having
tremendous campus recognition without
making it easy for said organizations to
utilize the tremendous publicity of the
newspaper.
Should this letter be printed, it will be
the only time (other than special-fee en
dorsements) that I've seen The Mind's
Eye mentioned in a long time. Now, 1
have nothing against the Chaparral, but
they are mentioned constantly in The
Daily. Why not have a rotating column
that describes what's happening with
various student groups? Why not trans
form .ill those extra ads for The Daily
(which are really just tiller) into space
that student organizations could capital
ize on at little or no cost?
In conclusion, The Daily is doing a
wonderful public service, but its role

could be improved. Find out what's it-al
ly going on with student groups and
spread the word to the i est of ( ampus. I o
take a shot .it a shameless plug, let people
know about events like the ret ent unveil
ing oi another issue of I lie Mind's Eve,
or that we've got a brand new Web site
(http://www.stantortl.etln group iniiids
eye). Don't just respond dm ing the li\ pe
of elections; 1 lit- l).ul\ should help
fledgling organizations and those with
substantial histon In sharing informed
results with its readers on a 1 egul.u basis.
