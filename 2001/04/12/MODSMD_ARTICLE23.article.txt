Criticism of Long 'misguided'
As .1 tiu nit\ memhei in the humanities
.md member ol ilu- select inn committee
tot the new dean <>t the School ot Hu
manities and S( iences. 1 must take excep
tion to some ot the \ iews expressed in the
vesterda\'s editorial ("New dean choice
raises red 11 tor humanities").
I he selection ot Biological Sciences
l'rof. Sharon Long .is the new dean was
the result ola painstaking process in
which .i committee ol nearly 20 members
ot the lac ult\. stall and student body ded
icated considerable time and energy to
examining the overall challenges faced
bv the school and to scouring the Uni
versity tor strong, capable and experi
enced candidates.
1 'lie humanities disciplines were very
well represented on the committee and, far
more often than not. the views of represen
tatives from the sciences, social sciences
and humanities were in perfect harmony.
In its deliberations, the committee explicit
ly considered the potential symbolism of
recommending the appointment of a new
dean from the humanities, and, indeed,
several prominent colleagues from within
the tolcl ot the humanities were on its final
short list.
Yet, in matters as crucial as the future
leadership of the largest school in the I ni
versitv, considerations of quality and lead
ership potential must necessarily t.ike
precedence over issues ot disc iplinary rep
resentation. From this standpoint. Long

emerged right from the start as one of the
outstanding candidates under considera
tion, and, in my view (and that of the com
mittee), the University should consider it
self fortunate indeed that she has accepted
Provost John Etcheniendy's offer.
As The Dailv is no doubt aw are, I am a
strong opponent of the effort to create a
unified Modern Languages and Litera
tures Department — an effort that 1 view
as unworthy of a major research universi
ty and as a throwback to the outdated
modes of organization that Stanford dis
carded in the 19605. So, while 1 share I he
Daily's concern about the need for imagi
native. forward-looking leadership iti the
humanities, the emphasis in this case is
misguided.
1 would propose a different headline re
garding the appointment ot Long as
dean — namely, "Sharon Long appointed
as first femule dean of humanities and sci
ences in the history of Stanford Universi
ty." The event in question is one we should
all welcome and celebrate, not bemoan.

Editorial 'superficial'
You cannot have it both ways. You dis
miss the fact that the provost is from the
humanities (philosophy) as unrelated to
his performance in office, hut assume, ap
parently without any communication
from her, that the behavior in office of the

new dean of Humanities and Sciences is
predetermined by the tact that slu- is from
the sciences (biology)- Would it not have
been more responsible (and also more in
teresting to all concerned — you, Biolog
ical Sciences Prof. Sharon Long, vour
readers), to have gone to the trouble of in
terviewing her before attacking her ap
pointment root and branch? You would
have found her to be .111 extraordinarilv
devoted and widely experienced Univer
sity citizen, as well as the brilliant scientist
you recognize her to be.
Ihe superficiality of your thinking
about the problems of the humanities is
indicated by your dismissal of the propos
al to combine the foreign language de
partments as being dictated bv "numbers
on a balance sheet." Language depart
ments everywhere live in a more or less
constant state of coming together and
breaking apart. When I came to Stanford
in the 19505, there was a single depart
ment of modern European languages
(Latin and Greek, being non-modern,
lived in the ('.lassies Department). Salva
tion is not guaranteed under any admin
istrative arrangement, but there's no rea
son to believe that bringing departments
together will necessarily diminish either
their effectiveness or their clout.
