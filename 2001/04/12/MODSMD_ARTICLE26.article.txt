## Gymnasts surge, land in 12th place Team rides coaching, talent and camaraderie to surprise the NCAA 
### KYLE WALLACE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I his year's Stanford men's
gymnastics team proved that cohe
siveness and a tenacious work
ethic go a long way to nuke up lor
the disadvantages resulting from a
lack of manpower and experience.
The No. 12 Cardinal began the
season with one senior and onlv
eight healthy athletes. However,
head coach Sadao Hamada had a
game plan that allowed the young,
relatively inexperienced team to
build from this seemingly sluk\
foundation into a team that vied
for the NCAA (championship.
The fait that the team's all
around score rose from a 190.65 in
the first dual meet against Califor
nia to a 208.75 and a 12th-place
finish in the NCAAs is a testament
to the success of Hamada's plan
and the men's willingness to work
hard to achieve the goals they es
tablished .it the beginning of the
season.
"The team improved tremen
dously this year," junior co-cap
tain David Durante said. "We not
only improved in our skill level.

but we also .ill got better at staying
ftxused during competitions and
not getting nervous when the
pressure was on."
The mental side of competi
tion and preparedness was the
main focus of Hamada's training
this year.
"The boys matured more and
learned how to prepare tor compe
tition," Hamada said. "Going
through this year, 1 was emphasiz
ing mental aspects more than skills,
which will help us to compete .it the
highest level in the future."
Hamada also stressed going
back to the fundamentals ot gym
nastics, perfecting those, and then
gradually building the skills and
increasing the level of ditliciilt\ in
the routines. Bv doing this, the
Cardinal was able to move from
being a team just hoping tor a spot
in the regional competition to a
team that competed well in the
NCAA ( hanipitmships.
"In past years, the team has
had tremendous expectations for
itself, but this year, with the num
ber of guvs we lost, it was hard for
us to set our goals too high."
freshman Dan Gill said. "In the
end, we not only surprised our
selves, but other teams around
the country. We put the message
out that we are going to be a team
