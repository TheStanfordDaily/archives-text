something of a joke to the Stanford
Media Relations Department? II
his play on the field fits the title,
then there's no reason to drop it.
C >arko continued his solid hit
ting throughout the top-ranked
Cardinal's 18-13 win over Nevada
(20-17) in.i non-conference game

statistics fora three-game series,
(iarko, who finished last weekend's
UCIA series 5-tbr-10 with four
RBI. went 3-fbr-5 with a home run
and three more RBI.
(iarko's seven RBI in his last
four games have already topped
the six RBI he hit in Ins previous 22
games, a marked difference in his

overall offensive contribution to
the team.

"He's swinging the bat well, and 1
think that will help us. It will give us
a bit of a lift."

Zandt and Scott Dragicevic h, along
with freshman Sam Fuld. bettered
Ciarko at the plate hv pic king up

over the fence in the sixth to give
Stanford a 14-5 lead.

including an RBI double in (lie top
of the eighth inning that extended
the ('.ardinal lead to If)-10. Fuld ex
tended his career-high hitting
streak to 12 games by going l-for-5
with a double and three RBI. The
freshman, who had struggled earli
