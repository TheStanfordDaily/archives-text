Ryan (iarko, "Budding."
The title is just starting to catch
on, and its popularity is fl\ ing taster
than ,i (iarko line drive, so jump on
the bandwagon early.
And so what if the name, short
for "Budding Superstar," was orig
inally selt-proc I,limed bv Garko as
something of a joke to the Stanford
Media Relations Department? II
his play on the field fits the title,
then there's no reason to drop it.
C >arko continued his solid hit
ting throughout the top-ranked
Cardinal's 18-13 win over Nevada
(20-17) in.i non-conference game
on Tuesday. But he wasn't the only
one who was hot .it tlu- plate for the
Cardinal (28-7), as many other
Stanford hitters looked like up
and-coming all-stars also. I he team
combined fora season high 23 hits
in the victory.
In a game that featured enough
statistics fora three-game series,
(iarko, who finished last weekend's
UCIA series 5-tbr-10 with four
RBI. went 3-fbr-5 with a home run
and three more RBI.
(iarko's seven RBI in his last
four games have already topped
the six RBI he hit in Ins previous 22
games, a marked difference in his

overall offensive contribution to
the team.
"He's pic ked it up offensively,"
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"He's swinging the bat well, and 1
think that will help us. It will give us
a bit of a lift."
However, juniors Arik \ an-
Zandt and Scott Dragicevic h, along
with freshman Sam Fuld. bettered
Ciarko at the plate hv pic king up
loin hits apieceâ€” a career high foi
all three players. VanZandt was a
triple awav from hitting for the
cycle, as he went 4-tbr-5 on the da\.
doubling in a run in the third in
ningand knoc kinga solo home run
over the fence in the sixth to give
Stanford a 14-5 lead.
Dragicevic li drove in two runs,
including an RBI double in (lie top
of the eighth inning that extended
the ('.ardinal lead to If)-10. Fuld ex
tended his career-high hitting
streak to 12 games by going l-for-5
with a double and three RBI. The
freshman, who had struggled earli
er in the season, now leads the team
with a .352 batting average.
Fuld also made an unconven
tional catch in the bottom of the
ninth inning to end the game. I le
slipped and fell in c enter field, onl\
to recover to make a spectacular
grab to end the Wolfpac k threat.
1 lie i ate h was ,i fitting end to a
xx.ukx game filled with nine home
runs. .SI total tuns and -t 1 total hits
in front <>l 1.L'72 fans .it Peccole
Park, main of whom were inebriat
ed. according to KXSI broach aster
|oc\ F.lger.
And the run total could have
easih been liighet because both
teams left I 3 runnel son base in the
game.
Kveil Marquess, who was
pleased with the win. admitted that
he had jiisi about seen enough at
the end of the four-hour, five
minute marathon.
It was a cra/x game," he said,
"hut giveotu hittei si redit, we had
.i gre.it oHensive game."
Although Andx lopham was

one of only three Stanford starters
who did not have a multiple-hit
game, he still managed to extend
bis team-leading and career-high
bitting streak to 14 games. The ju
nior third baseman did it xx itli style
as well, as hisonlv hit of the dav was
a solo home run in the top of the
third inning.
Junior Mike Wodnicki (3-1)
only had to pitch 1 1/3 innings to
pick up bis third win of the sea
son. Wodnicki was the third of
seven Cardinal pitchers used on
the dav. lim Cunningham, who
started the game, gave up three
runs on three hits and xvas pulled
after two innings of work, earning
a no-decision.
Stanford, which has won 14 of
its last l(i games, noxv shifts its
focus to ()regon State (21-13, 5-4).
Fhe Cardinal will host the Beavers
foi .i three-game series that starts
today and ends on Saturday, one

clay earlier than usual because of
Kaster Sunclav.
Sophomore Jeremy Ciuthrie
(7-1) will tr\ to get back on track
this week as tonight's starter, after
having lost his last outing to the
Bruins. Junior Jeff Bruksch, the
l'ac-10 Pitc her of the Week as a re
sult of his 12-strikeout and eight
shutout inning performance last
week, will be the Friday starter,
and junior Mike (iosling will make
his third consecutive start in the
series' closer on Saturday.
Bruksch has only given up four
earned runs in his last 53 2/3 in
nings pitched, while (iosling has
assured everyone that he is
healtln b\ pitching 13 innings of
one-run baseball.
And, oh yeah, not to be forgot
ten, w ill be that player behind the
plate with the mask, calling the sig
nals and snaring the quick pitc lies.
1 hat's right, "Budding,"
