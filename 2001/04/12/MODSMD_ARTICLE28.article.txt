# Tiger's mastered golf, and he has the wardrobe to prove it

He's not retired. He's hanging up a
very handsome green jacket this week.
What Tiger Woods finished this week
end was a year-long accomplishment the
likes of which we will never see again in
golf, unless lit- can match it. In winning his
second Masters, he became the first man to
ever win four straight majors, and the fact
that he crossed a calendar year to do it is
inconsequential.
Not only will you never see anyone else
do that in golf again, vou likely won't see
anything like it in sports fora verv long
time, maybe ever.
Vou can find comparisons: Rod leaver
completed the tennis (irand Slam twice, in
1962 and 1969. Joe DiMaggio's 56-ganie
hitting streak has been brought out for

comparison. Bill Russell
led his teams to an
NCAA (/hampionship,
.in ()lvmpic gold medal
and an NBA champi

1956 and April 1957.
And those are won

couldn't tlo it.
Putts lipped the cup and spun out. I)ri

looked laser-guided to the hole stopped

just short.
Woods kept holding the lead, but
couldn't quite protect it; he tell into a tie

then slipped. It was like watching the Red

ninth with Carlos Delgatlo coming to bat
and Rod "Whiplash" Beck warming up in

Mickclson and Duval struggled them

He's not retired. He's hanging up a
very handsome green jacket this week.
What Tiger Woods finished this week
end was a year-long accomplishment the
likes of which we will never see again in
golf, unless lit- can match it. In winning his
second Masters, he became the first man to
ever win four straight majors, and the fact
that he crossed a calendar year to do it is
inconsequential.
Not only will you never see anyone else
do that in golf again, vou likely won't see
anything like it in sports fora verv long
time, maybe ever.
Vou can find comparisons: Rod leaver
completed the tennis (irand Slam twice, in
1962 and 1969. Joe DiMaggio's 56-ganie
hitting streak has been brought out for

comparison. Bill Russell
led his teams to an
NCAA (/hampionship,
.in ()lvmpic gold medal
and an NBA champi

1956 and April 1957.
