### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
Heading into the final weekend of
the regular season, the skies over what
has been a rather turbulent year for the
Stanford men's volleyball team seem to
be clearing.
The No. 5 Cardinal (13-7.9-6 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) has
weathered a storm of injuries through
out the season, leaving the team without
one or more of its starters in halt of the
matches it has played this season.
Although Stanford is only 4-6 when
missing one of its starters, the team is 9-
1 when at full strength. And with all
seven of its starters cleared to take the
court, the Cardinal is in full gear for its
matches against No. H I ('.-Irvine (11-12,
6-9) tomorrow and No. 3 UCLA (19-6.
11-4) on Saturday. Both matches begin
at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"Having everyone out there gives all
of us a lot of confidence," said sopho
more outside hitter Curt loppel, who
leads the team with 5.52 kills per game.
"I have no doubt that our team, when its
healthy, can beat any other team and

win a national championship."
Stanford took the first steps towards
that national championship with its w ins
last weekend over No. 11 LC-Santa Bar
bara and No. 14 Cal State-Nortbridge,
which qualified the Cardinal tor the
MPSF tournament.
The two wins marked the return of
redshirt sophomore libcro Seth Ring
and junior outside hitter Marcus Ska
eel to the lineup from ankle injuries.
Ring and Skacel's return ended an
eight-week stretch during which Stan
ford watched one starter after another
tall to injuries.
"The ankles of Marcus and Seth are
still of a bit of concern, but we feel verv
good about where we are health-wise.'
said head coach Rulx'n Nicvcs. "We're
on track to be at full strength for the 112 ii st
round of the tournament."
The MPSF tournament kicks off next
weekend with the four teams that own
the best conference records hosting the
first-round matches. While the ( '.ardinal
holds a very outside chance of securing
homecourt in the first round, Stanford
will likely be heading south to face No. 6

I lie prospect of facing the Bruins in
the first round of the tournament puts a
bit more emphasis on Stanford's Satur
day match.
UCLA will already be looking to
avenge a H-2 loss to the Cardinal on
Man li 9. After coming ba< k from a 2-0
deficit in the match, the Bruins tailed to
convert on three match points in the
fifth game, allowing the ('.ardinal to pull
off an 18-16 win in the final frame to take
the match.
"I ( AA is going to come out with a lot
of tire because they probably feel like
they let one slip to us earlier in the sea
son." said sophomore outside hitter
Billy Strickland. " They've managed to
avenge all of then losses tins season, but
hopefully we can be able to stop them
from doing il to us.
