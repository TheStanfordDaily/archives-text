## 
### AMIR ZAMANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
David Horowitz, editor in chief of
FrontPage magazine, recently raised a
whirlwind of controversy with liis adver
tisement entitled "Ten Reasons Wh\ Repa
rations for Slaverv is a Bad Idea — and
Racist I oil." I lie advertisement appeared
in college newspapers across the conntrv,
igniting vehement debate and outrage in
many cases.
I he college newspapers that ran the ad,
which in< lude I (1-Berkeley's llie Daily ('al
ifornian, were met with protest from mem
bers of their respective student bodies. Se
nior Daniel Hernandez, editor in chief ot
I he I >,iil\ (.allforman. said that -10 to 50 pro
testers tame to his of fire the morning the ad
vertisement was published and "demanded
to know what happened."
According to Hernandez. "[The adver
tisement! was published without the
knowledge of the editorial staff," which is
in violation of standard protocol. Normal
l\. the editorial staff would review such an
advertisement before including it in an
issue, but, in this situation, I lernandez said
that there was"a breakdown of communi
cation internally."
Because ot this internal mistake, 1 lernan
<lc/ issued a front-page apology in the fol
lowing issue — an apology that I lorowitz la
beled "disgraceful."
Horowitz said that Hernandez's apology
is .in example of succumbing to external
pressures. He has attempted to argue that
not printing advertisements is a violation of
the First Amendment.
Meanwhile. Hernandez, said he thinks
that "tliis is not about free speech. Newspa
pers have "even right to reject an ad," Her

nandez said, and he believes that I lorowitz. is
siniph performing a "publicity stunt."
Horowitz criticized this attitude, saving
that college campuses should foster educat
ed debates. "What do you gin s do when you
go to college? Aren't you supposed to rea
son?" he argued.
Next in Horowitz's line of argument is
his belief that "fear keeps people's
mouths shut on the issue." According to
Horowits, the fear of being called a racist
today is analogous to an American's fear
of being called a Communist during the
era of McCarthvism.
Some people, like Richard Cohen of The
Washington Post, have argued that putting
the actual logic of the advertisement aside,
the tone that Horowitz used in delineating
his points is "smug, cold - dismissive.
Horowitz admitted that he was a "little
guilty" in this respect, but claims that the
"smug" tone of the advertisement mainly re
sulted from having to condense the original
article into an advertisement.
He said he does not believe that he is a
racial provocateur, nor does he believe that
he is "in confrontation with the African-
American community." I Ic says that he per
sonally has "a genuine concern for African
Americans themselves."
I lorowitz has criticized African-American
leaders on the grounds that they promote
the idea of African Americans as victims. Ac
cording to Horowitz, this is "c rippling" and
stifles their potential.
Horowitz, a staunch conservative, said he
used to consider himself a "Marxist and a
revolutionary." As the son of two Commu
nist parents, he grew up a radical and be
came a member of the Black Panthers, a left-
ist organization devoted to im
proving the social, political and
economic situation of the black
community.
After lie became disillusioned
with the future prospects of the
Black Panthers and their means ot
accomplishing objectives,
Horowitz re-evaluated Ins beliefs

and gradually changed to a more
conservative stance.
Though Hernandez labeled
Horowitz's ad\ertisement a
"stunt," Horowit/. claimed that,
"in ihe davs to come, [he is] not
going to be hiding in anybodv's
closet." He said he is going to be
out there lighting his "battle" until
"American campuses are made
salt- for learning, which means
"sale tor expressing different
points ot view ."
