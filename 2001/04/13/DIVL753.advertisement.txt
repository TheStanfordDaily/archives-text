Searching for the Shortest Network:
A Math Lecture for the Public
There are many situations in which one would like to connect a collection of points in some metric space by a network having the
minimum possible total length. Such problems have a long and distinguished history, and occur in such areas as the design and
analysis of telecommunications, networks, and heating and aiKonditioning duct systems, algorithms for molecular phylogentics,
and the layout of circuits on VSLI chips, to name a few. In this talk, we survey what is known and what is not known about this
problem, and how it has been impacted by current developments in theoretical computer science.
