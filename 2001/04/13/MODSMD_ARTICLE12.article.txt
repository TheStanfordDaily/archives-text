l>\ two students running loi ASM president and
\ i( e president. I i nesto Real and I lai ve\ I lukari.
"W'e are tunning tor pi esident and \ ice president
in ordei to abolish the ASS I I nlike our opponents,
who come forward with .1 vatiet\ of programs and
proposals to demonstrate that ihe\ are the best qual
ified people, all we have to offer is the analvsis that
real student power exists in .1 wide variet\ of volun
tar\ student organizations and not 111 the ASS I .
"We propose that VSSI membership be made
voluntan .is ,t fiist step to restricting its functions,
.ind to th.it end we urge that students vote lor the
