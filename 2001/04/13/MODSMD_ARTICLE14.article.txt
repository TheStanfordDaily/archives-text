### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Prof. Fbrahim Moosa, one of Stanford's
foremost experts on Islamic Studies, is leaving
Stanford to take a tenure-track position at Duke
University.
1 o the chagrin of many of Moosa's students
and colleagues, Stanford's Lu k of a fullv-tund
ed Islamic studies position in tin- Religious
Studies Department meant that the beloved
professor had to go elsewhere if he wished to
advance his career.
"1 he departure of Kbrahini Moosa and his
fatnih is a loss for Stanford, and 1 shall miss
their presence here," said Religious Studies
Prof. Robert ('»regg. "He is an exciting and de
manding teat her, a fine scholar, and a splendid
university participant."
Moosa's departure will leave Jacqueline
Annijo-Hussain, a \ isiting professor, as theonU
facultx member in the department who leaches
courses on Islam.

Freshman Bret Peace wrote a letter to I ni
versitv President John I lenness\ expressing his
admiration for Moosa and his disappointment
that the I niveisilv did not do more to eiuour
age him to stav. In response. Peace said Hen
ness\ acknowledged that Stanford was suffer
ing a loss but noted that the move was Moosa's
choice.
"The tragedv is the I niversitv's failure to
make it in Prof. Moosa's best interest to siav
here, in out Religious Studies department."
said Peace. "Losing Prof. Moosa in one sense is
a statement about the priorities of this univei si
tv, in eflect, a disregard for the role Islam pla\s
in our world."
Others are displeased that Stanford has no
tenure-track positions available to Islamic
scholars in the Religious Studies Department
and see the loss of Moosa as a potential wake-up
call to the I niversitv.
