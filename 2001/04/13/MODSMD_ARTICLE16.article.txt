## The 						Stanford Daily University labor stance should be more proactive 
### 
S I'ANFORI) HAS OFTKN chosen to
ignore labor disputes between sub
contractors and unions, arguing that
the University lias no influence over
how subcontractors treat their workers. 1 he
lack of administrative involvement in recent
conflicts between Bon Appetit and Local 715
(a Stanford union) emphasizes this philoso
phy of non-interference. We believe, though,
that .is the employers of labor subcontractors,
Stanford has a significant influence on their
labor practices. The University should be
proactive, enforcing a labor standard that en
sures th.it service workers on this campus are
respected.
At a recent public meeting, I diversity
President John Hennessv said that set vice
workers are not a direct part of the Stanford
community because tliev provide subcon
tracted labor. I le said that Stanford lias no di
rect obligation to these workers, stating that
the subcontractors the I niversit\ hires main
tain fair labor practices.
Hut recent interactions between Bon Ap
petit .ind Local 715 suggest otherwise. Karli
er this year, workers filed complaints that
their schedules had been altered without
prior notice and that their hours had been
cut. Also, first-aid kits had been removed
from work areas and, after repeated com-

plaints, the Occupational Safety and Health
Agent s came in to resolve the issue and rein
stall the kits.
While (his situation challenges the claim
that Stanford subcontractors uphold just
labor practices, what this conflict also reveals
is a dangerous pattern of administrative in
difference toward labor disputes.
At the I niversitv, the main agent that
checks the actions of labor subcontractors are
the unions that represent Stanford workers,
Local 715 and Local 1577. Stanford unions
keep a close eve on the actions of subcontrac
tors and generalh take action when thev feel
that fair labor practices are not being upheld.
I'he labor conflicts waged on the Stanford
campus have generally been two-party inter
actions between subcontractors and unions.
I his is not to say, though, that the I niver
sitv has not been asked numerous times to
step in and help resolve a labor situation.
Dining the |ustice for |anitors campaign last
spring, students and Local 1877 asked the
I Diversity to make a statement about the
campaign and the subcontractor, Able Bod\
Maintenance, for which the janitors work.
I he I niversitv refused to do so, making the
claim that it does not have influence over sub
contractor-union disputes.
But the I niversitv s c laim is not onl\ falla

i ions, but harmful as well. While it might be
true that the University does hire subcontrac
tors who they believe maintain just labor
practices, the reality is th.it the treatment ol
workers by subcontractors is not fixed or ab
solute. Indeed, subcontractors adjust their
treatment ol workers according to the envi
ronment, changing wages and benefits de
pending on the context. For example, Able
bod\ Maintenance pays their janitors in San
Francisco a higher wage than their Stanford
janitors.
I hese discrepancies do not exist because
subcontractors feel that it is "just" to pav a
worker in San Francisco more than a worker
in Stockton because of a higher cost ol living.
R,it her, these deferences are created because
generalh areas where subcontracted workers
receive higher wages and better benefits have
more external forces — such as cit\ govern
ments, unions, and universities — pressuring
them to uphold fair labor practices.
When outside forces are not active, subcon
tractors are often able to take greater advan
tage ol their workers, and the non-involve
ment of the administration in subcontractor
union disputes allows just that to happen. Be
cause the I niversitv hires these subcontrac
tors, it has the power to define the labor stan
dards that must be upheld In these subcon-

llicts, Stanford is forfeiting its leverage over
subcontractors, allowing them to potentially
adopt more unjust labor practices and leaving
only the unions to keep them in check.
I niversities like Johns Hopkins have im
plemented certain labor standards, such as
having a living wage for all campus workers.
These universities will only hire subcontrac

wages and benefits for their workers, and the
subcontractors must maintain these stan
dards if they .ti e to do business with the uni
versities. Kven though these universities do
not directly hire the service workers, it is
their active involvement and interest in the
treatment of workers that makes certain that
subcontractors are maintaining fair labor
practices.
The University should adopt a similar
stance, creating a set of labor standards for
subcontractors that ensures th.it workers feel
respected, valued and included in this com
munitv. Apathv is just as influential as direct
conflict. While increasing subcontracted
labor does distance the economic relation
ship between the University and service
workers, the use ol subcontractors does not
change the relationship of accountability be

subcontractors, allowing them to potentially
adopt more unjust labor practices and leaving
only the unions to keep them in check.
I niversities like Johns Hopkins have im
plemented certain labor standards, such as
having a living wage for all campus workers.
These universities will only hire subcontrac
tors that provide a certain minimum level of
wages and benefits for their workers, and the
subcontractors must maintain these stan
dards if they .ti e to do business with the uni
versities. Kven though these universities do
not directly hire the service workers, it is
their active involvement and interest in the
treatment of workers that makes certain that
subcontractors are maintaining fair labor
practices.
The University should adopt a similar
stance, creating a set of labor standards for
subcontractors that ensures th.it workers feel
respected, valued and included in this com
munitv. Apathv is just as influential as direct
conflict. While increasing subcontracted
labor does distance the economic relation

workers, the use ol subcontractors does not
change the relationship of accountability be
tween the two.
S I'ANFORI) HAS OFTKN chosen to
ignore labor disputes between sub
contractors and unions, arguing that
the University lias no influence over
how subcontractors treat their workers. 1 he
lack of administrative involvement in recent
conflicts between Bon Appetit and Local 715
(a Stanford union) emphasizes this philoso
phy of non-interference. We believe, though,
that .is the employers of labor subcontractors,
Stanford has a significant influence on their
labor practices. The University should be
proactive, enforcing a labor standard that en
sures th.it service workers on this campus are
respected.
At a recent public meeting, I diversity
President John Hennessv said that set vice
workers are not a direct part of the Stanford
community because tliev provide subcon
tracted labor. I le said that Stanford lias no di
rect obligation to these workers, stating that
the subcontractors the I niversit\ hires main
tain fair labor practices.
Hut recent interactions between Bon Ap
petit .ind Local 715 suggest otherwise. Karli
er this year, workers filed complaints that
their schedules had been altered without
prior notice and that their hours had been
cut. Also, first-aid kits had been removed
from work areas and, after repeated com-

plaints, the Occupational Safety and Health
Agent s came in to resolve the issue and rein
stall the kits.
While (his situation challenges the claim
that Stanford subcontractors uphold just
labor practices, what this conflict also reveals
is a dangerous pattern of administrative in
difference toward labor disputes.
At the I niversitv, the main agent that
checks the actions of labor subcontractors are
the unions that represent Stanford workers,
Local 715 and Local 1577. Stanford unions
keep a close eve on the actions of subcontrac
tors and generalh take action when thev feel
that fair labor practices are not being upheld.
I'he labor conflicts waged on the Stanford
campus have generally been two-party inter
actions between subcontractors and unions.
I his is not to say, though, that the I niver
sitv has not been asked numerous times to
step in and help resolve a labor situation.
Dining the |ustice for |anitors campaign last
spring, students and Local 1877 asked the
I Diversity to make a statement about the
campaign and the subcontractor, Able Bod\
Maintenance, for which the janitors work.
I he I niversitv refused to do so, making the
claim that it does not have influence over sub
contractor-union disputes.
But the I niversitv s c laim is not onl\ falla

i ions, but harmful as well. While it might be
true that the University does hire subcontrac
tors who they believe maintain just labor
practices, the reality is th.it the treatment ol
workers by subcontractors is not fixed or ab
solute. Indeed, subcontractors adjust their
treatment ol workers according to the envi
ronment, changing wages and benefits de
pending on the context. For example, Able
bod\ Maintenance pays their janitors in San
Francisco a higher wage than their Stanford
janitors.
I hese discrepancies do not exist because
subcontractors feel that it is "just" to pav a
worker in San Francisco more than a worker
in Stockton because of a higher cost ol living.
R,it her, these deferences are created because
generalh areas where subcontracted workers
receive higher wages and better benefits have
more external forces — such as cit\ govern
ments, unions, and universities — pressuring
them to uphold fair labor practices.
When outside forces are not active, subcon
tractors are often able to take greater advan
tage ol their workers, and the non-involve
ment of the administration in subcontractor
union disputes allows just that to happen. Be
cause the I niversitv hires these subcontrac
tors, it has the power to define the labor stan
dards that must be upheld In these subcon-
