## We can't ignore hate crimes, racism 
### 
IS
We all know about the racist
graffiti scrawled in the His
tory Corner at the end of
last quarter. And we all
know how the Iniversitv dealt with it:
got rid of it and created distance frolll .ill
responsibility for its occurrence. I Ins
stands out as a glaring example of the
wav Stanford handles racial insensitivity
on campus.
Because I'm only a freshman, I can t
speak with much firsthand experience
about racial tensions .it Stanford. But 1
am aware of their existence. Stanford
cannot and nevet w ill be the shining ex
ample of c ultural acceptance and diver
sity that we .ill wish it to be. It can no
longer exist on that celestial pedestal of
racial tolerance and hope for the future
that we "need" it to. Stanford, converse
ly, seems inextricably bound to that
other side of America — that "average"
America — that is full of prejudice and
irrational hate.
Imagine tnv surprise, during ()rienta
tion, when I passed the Row to see a large
replication of the Confederate flag hang
ing as the decorative symbol of a dorm's
ill-conceived yearly theme. I he I 'Diversi
ty asked the house to remove the flag, but
there was little discussion of its implica
tions. I didn't realize it then, but the I ni
versity's reaction to the flag is an accurate
portrayal of how Stanford conventionally
deals with on-campus rat i.il insensitivitv:
get rid of it and deny any and all "incrim
inating" association with the prejudice.
lake the example of the "controver
sial" material in Big Game Gaieties this
year. The scene, which depicted a stereo
typical American Indian, was stripped
after two days of performance. It was not
until the American Indian community
expressed its outrage at the "racially in
sensitive" depiction that any action was
taken. The University's reaction: fire the

producer for "unrelat
ed reasons" and protest
the show In threaten
ing to boycott "c elebri
tv" appearances b\ "sev
eral administrators.
How does Stanford
react? C let rid of the ev
idence and clem am as
sch iation.

Hie (onfcdcratc flag and the portra\ -
al of the American Indian girl exist as
symbols of an era that minorit\ communi
ties are attempting to transcend. And re
gardless of the "thematic necessit\" or
humor of these symbols, tliev are still
hurtful to some. Furthermore, the I ni
versitv's failure to recogni/e the serious
ness of these incidents is incredibly hurt
ful to main in the Stanford community.
But this most recent racial controvers\
is different. I nlike the raising of the ('on
federate flag and the portrayal of the
American Indian girl, the graffiti found
around campus is blatantb racist and
misogynistic. I nlike the other incidents
this ve.it. which were basically just ill-ad
vised, the gratliti is intentionally hurtful
and extremely threatening.
We have a different situation on our
hands this time, and how is the adminis
tration attempting to deal with it? Re
move it quieth and deny any implications
that the problem is internal and threat
ening to our world at Stanford. When
Communication Prof. Laura Leets
placed photographs of the graffiti on a
Web site for all in the Stanford communi
ty to see and analyze, she received heavy
criticism from the administration. How
ever. the recent demand by many stu
dents to see the graffiti says a lot about the
majority of people here at Stanford.
"The fact that people were disturbed
bv it is a good sign." says kvra (ireene. an
instructor for Sociology 145: "Race and

Kthnu Relations." People should ho dis
turbed by the recent findings. Kvervone,
including the people who wet en't e\pli( -
it 1\ targeted in the graffiti, should teel
personalh wounded b\ these hateful re
marks because thc\ threaten our sense ot
intellectual integrity. These words threat
en out tight to revel 111 the diversity here
at Stanford.
What does tlu- I niversit\ need to do?
It needs to address these controversial in
cidents and anal\/c them. We need to
discuss them and discuss them until we
arc tired of talking about racial differ
ences .ind misogvnv in America. This in
cident. in essence, will serve as a critical
test to the I nivet sit\ s true desire to back
up its support of race dialogues here at
Stanford. I bis approach will be more dif
ficult .ind more tiresome, but, in the end.
it will allow Stanford to truly take advan
tage of the diversity of which we (laim to
be so proud.
Some criticize ethnic studies with the
argument that we, as a human race, are
bevond the need tor it. I even read a let
ter to the editor earlier this year that crit
icized ethnic theme dormitories for mak
ing non-minorities feel uncomfortable
during discussions about race. Why is ev
eryone so afraid of this sense of uneasi
ness during conversations? Mavbe we're
just all afraid that we'll say something
that we really mean and be ashamed of
ourselves.
But we can't hide from racism and we
can't hide 112 rom ourselves. Racism will be
here until we confront it head on — until
we acknowledge it and are ashamed.
Stanford must acknowledge its own part
in the wrongs; covering it up will only
serve as an educational injustice.

We all know about the racist
graffiti scrawled in the His
tory Corner at the end of
last quarter. And we all
know how the Iniversitv dealt with it:
got rid of it and created distance frolll .ill
responsibility for its occurrence. I Ins
stands out as a glaring example of the
wav Stanford handles racial insensitivity
on campus.
Because I'm only a freshman, I can t
speak with much firsthand experience
about racial tensions .it Stanford. But 1
am aware of their existence. Stanford
cannot and nevet w ill be the shining ex
ample of c ultural acceptance and diver
sity that we .ill wish it to be. It can no
longer exist on that celestial pedestal of
racial tolerance and hope for the future
that we "need" it to. Stanford, converse
ly, seems inextricably bound to that
other side of America — that "average"
America — that is full of prejudice and
irrational hate.
Imagine tnv surprise, during ()rienta
tion, when I passed the Row to see a large
replication of the Confederate flag hang
ing as the decorative symbol of a dorm's
ill-conceived yearly theme. I he I 'Diversi
ty asked the house to remove the flag, but
there was little discussion of its implica
tions. I didn't realize it then, but the I ni
versity's reaction to the flag is an accurate
portrayal of how Stanford conventionally
deals with on-campus rat i.il insensitivitv:
get rid of it and deny any and all "incrim
inating" association with the prejudice.
lake the example of the "controver
sial" material in Big Game Gaieties this
year. The scene, which depicted a stereo
typical American Indian, was stripped
after two days of performance. It was not
until the American Indian community
expressed its outrage at the "racially in
sensitive" depiction that any action was
taken. The University's reaction: fire the

producer for "unrelat
ed reasons" and protest
the show In threaten
ing to boycott "c elebri
tv" appearances b\ "sev
eral administrators.
How does Stanford
react? C let rid of the ev
idence and clem am as
sch iation.

Hie (onfcdcratc flag and the portra\ -
al of the American Indian girl exist as
symbols of an era that minorit\ communi
ties are attempting to transcend. And re
gardless of the "thematic necessit\" or
humor of these symbols, tliev are still
hurtful to some. Furthermore, the I ni
versitv's failure to recogni/e the serious
ness of these incidents is incredibly hurt
ful to main in the Stanford community.
But this most recent racial controvers\
is different. I nlike the raising of the ('on
federate flag and the portrayal of the
American Indian girl, the graffiti found
around campus is blatantb racist and
misogynistic. I nlike the other incidents
this ve.it. which were basically just ill-ad
vised, the gratliti is intentionally hurtful
and extremely threatening.
We have a different situation on our
hands this time, and how is the adminis
tration attempting to deal with it? Re
move it quieth and deny any implications
that the problem is internal and threat
ening to our world at Stanford. When
Communication Prof. Laura Leets
placed photographs of the graffiti on a
Web site for all in the Stanford communi
ty to see and analyze, she received heavy
criticism from the administration. How
ever. the recent demand by many stu
dents to see the graffiti says a lot about the
majority of people here at Stanford.
