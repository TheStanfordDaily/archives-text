Montoya there for "every pivotal point
in my Stanford career"
It saddened me to learn toda\ that Jim
Montova will be leaving Stanford in June.
Although 1 have onlv spoken with him
once or twice in m\ four years at Stanford.
1 consider him to be a 112 riend of mine. N ice
Provost Montoya — or Dean Montova, as
he is known to the ( lass of 2001 — has
been present at almost every pivotal point
in my Stanford career. He was there to
welcome us to the Farm as freshmen and
to assure us all that we were not "mis
takes." During Sophomore College, he
added perspective In sharing his experi
ences .is an undergraduate at Stanford.
When we were nervous new resident
assistants, he consoled us with the fact that
our residents would one dav invite us to
their weddings, just as thev had done tor
him. Before we graduate this June, 1 have
no doubt that he will share more lite
lessons with us. You see, even as an ad
ministrator. his unmistakable stvlc always
made us feel like he was one of us. Vice
Provost Montoya, thank you tor your
monumental service to the University. I lis
finesse, integrity and love for Stanford
have not ceased to amaze me in my tour

vcars here. 1 wish him the Ix-st of luck in
his future endeavors.

'existing hierarchies'
W hen I read Friday's story, "Nearly 200
girls rush sororities." I wondered if we would
ever read about "200 boys" entering frater
nities. Can you imagine 18- to 22-year-old
males being referred to as "boys"? Doubtful.
I imagine th.it we will lx' reading of "men"
entering fraternities, language can power
fully replicate existing hierarchies, and such
is the c .isc here. As we (1 use "we" to refer to
the responsibilities of each of us in our daily
language) continue to refer to college-aged
women as "girls," we further the view of
these women as somehow less than the same
aged "men. We need to stop referring to
women as "girls," as somehow less mature
and less capable than men, who are never
boys in our soc iallv constructed language.
