I-ast night, Prot. J alee! Abtlul-
Adil ol the University of Illiik.it
(Ihicagc) gave a lect i ire ei it it let! "Tlle
Confusion of Color: How Can We
Kradicate Racism on (.ampusand in
the Community?" The lecture was
part of 1 si.mi Awareness Week.
Abdul-Adit presented Islam as a
"potential vehicle" for organizing
human affairs and as a solution to
capitalism.
Ahdul-Adil began his discussion
by defining race and racism. Ik
said that there is a segment in soci
ety that believes that color should
not be a barrier, \et the problem of
racism comes about when these
"ideals are not reflected and en
forced In institutions" because then
they siniph become "mere fanciful
philosophy," lie said.
He suggested that we "roll up
our sleeves and take a look at capi
talism.' He talked about the main

different ethnic groups that have
been oppressed In capitalism and
how it has been the basis for ex
ploitation in this countr\.
Abdul-Ac lil c hallenged Stanford
students to question the system so
that tlie\ would not leave the Uni
versity as "brain-washed rofx>ts." 1 le
urged students to think of things be
yond materialism and to speak then
minds no matter hem controversial.
"If we are willing to allow injus
tice to be perpetuated lx.vau.se it is
putting dollars in our pot kets, then
we are merely being tacit collabora
tors." .-Mxlul-Aclil said.
"Capitalism breeds competition
and promotes individualism,
whereas Islam sa\s you compete to
see how humble vouc an Ix.' and how
much vou can contribute to the
community."
"1 would sav Islam is the solu
tion." Absul-Adil said. At the same
time, be said that the lecture u.is in
tended to be a "spring board to an
ongoing discussion to see which s\ s

tetn is tlic best."
|enique Meekins, a freshman,
attended flu' lecture and s.tid that
she (fit that, though Alulul-Adil
s.iid that he was not preaching tor
tin.' conversion of Islam, he in fact
was doing so.
"I felt that it was basically a lie and
that the lecture was about conver
sion." Meekins said. Meekins also
said that she had .1 problem with
Abdul-Adit's idea that capitalism
should be replaced with Islam. She
said that it seemed th.it .111 economic
sy stem like capitalism should be re
placed with another economic sys
tem .ind not .1 religion.
Junior I rem Saleem. the coordi
nator of Islam Awareness Week, dis
agreed with Meekins. s.i\ing that the
lecture was gi\en only to "create
awareness." Saleem s.ud that she did
"not want people to be given the
wrong impression because this lec
ture .lims to promote Ijetter cross
cultural examination, which is the
vision of this yvcek."
