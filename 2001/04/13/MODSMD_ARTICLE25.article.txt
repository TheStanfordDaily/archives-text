calmlv helped police end a 10-
hour standoff.
Anne Sluti, an honor student

mall in her hometown last Fridav
and took her 900 miles awav to this
small resort town on Flathead
Lake.
1 le had eluded authorities since

Minnesota court on a burglarv
charge. Zappa, also known as An
thonv Wright, is also wanted on
charges that include assault, theft

and illegal gun possession in Ne
braska, Louisiana, lowa and Wis
consin.
A landlord who spotted a car
outside the supposedh empt\
cabin tipped off authorities
Wednesda\ evening. Negotiators
said Slut i was their only contact foi
hours, acting as a go-between witli
Zappa, who would not come to the
telephone until the very end.
" 1 here's no doubt in mv mind
the role she pla\ed in ending this,"
said I ndersheritf Mike Sargent,
one of the negotiators. " I lie wa\
she handled herself when dealing
with me was ver\ calm and cool
and collected."
Sheriff hill Barron said Sluti
was "very clever and ver\ brave."
1 lie standoff ended shorth
after 3 a.m. when Zappa walked
out and surrendered, authorities
said. Sluti followed close behind.
Zappa was taken off to jail.
Sargent said Sluti did a remark
able job of helping convince Zappa
that the 50 or s<# officers surround
ing the cabin would not harm him
if he came out.
"From our very first conversa
tion, she expressed that loin

wanted to end this, and when it
did end, he wanted it peaceful
ly, Sargent said. "He needed re
assurance that we wanted to end
this peacefully. I got him calmed
down and he surrendered
peacefully."
Sluti disappeared Friday from
the parking lot of the Hilltop
Shopping Center in Kearney,
where her purse and other be
longings were found. Zappa was
linked to the crime bv a stolen
1987 ( hew Suburban later found
SO miles from the cabin.
Sluti managed to make three
brief phone ( alls last weekend, in
cluding one to 91 I from a cabin
outside Livingston, about 800
miles from Rollins. li\ the time au
thorities arrived, the cabin was
emptv. Hie girl also managed to
call her family and a friend on Sat
urday. but those calls were cut off,
authorities said.
At one point last month, the
manhunt for Zappa prompted po
lice to close the Mall of America in
Bloomington, Minn. — the na
tion's biggest mall — to search the
the place after he was spotted
there.
