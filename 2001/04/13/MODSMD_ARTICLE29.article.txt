Talk about heating up at the
right time.
After its 5-2 win over No. 20 C -al
ifornia on fuesdav, the No. 1 Stan
ford (Cardinal (16-1, 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference) men's tennis team will
head into two tough weekend
matches against 32nd-ranked Ari
zona State (9-9, 3-2) today and No.
33 Arizona (12-0, 2-5) tomorrow
having won its last 10 mate lies, in
< hiding a rare Los Angeles sweep
against No. 1 I'CIA and No. 21
Southern California.
The two matches are the last two
that will count toward Stanford's
Pac-10 record, because only one
match of the two played against Pac
-10 opponents count toward the
conference record. If the Cardinal
comes out victorious in both match
es this weekend, as expected, it will
have swept its Pac-10 schedule and
will garner this year's Pac-10crown.
Both the Wildcats and Sun Dev
ils are looking for revenge as both
teams lost to Stanford when the
Cardinal traveled to Arizona a few
weekends ago.
In the first match. Stanford will
face three dangerous singles players

Dubev will most likely play .it
No. 1 singles against Stanford's se
nior No. 2 Alex Kmi (18-2). Dubev
is a transfer from New Mexico
State, where he led the Lobos to a

conference championship last
year. I le hopes to come up with an
answer to Kim's recent tear in the
singles circuit.

junior. Both plavers, known for
their strength in serves, will at
tempt to overpower the other in
what promises to be an explosive
match-up.
Duranovic, a standout as a junior
from Bosnia 1 lerzegovina, hopes to
bring his "A" game against a strug
gling sophomore David Martin (18-
11), ranked No. 31 nationallv. After
a hot start, Martin has lost five of his
last six matches.
"Through the course of a long
season, everyone has their ups and
down and confidence ebbs and
flows," said head coach Dick (iould.
"David has struggled a little latelv,
although 1 felt Dave looked good
against Cal [on ruesdav]."
Rounding out the lineup at the
Nos. 4-0 positions for the Wildcats
will most likely be Pim Van Mele,
()livier Chanoin and |arrod I cker
matin. For the Cardinal the proba
ble matchups will be No. 77 sopho
more Ryan Haviland and seniors
Scotty Scott and Ali Ansari.
"We mav make a small adjust
ment or two, but nothing extraor
dinary," Gould s.iid of the lineup.
"I do want to get [Scott] Lipsk\
into a couple of matches to keep
