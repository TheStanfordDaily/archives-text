## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Talk about heating up at the
right time.
After its 5-2 win over No. 20 C -al
ifornia on fuesdav, the No. 1 Stan
ford (Cardinal (16-1, 5-0 Pacific 10
Conference) men's tennis team will
head into two tough weekend
matches against 32nd-ranked Ari
zona State (9-9, 3-2) today and No.
33 Arizona (12-0, 2-5) tomorrow
having won its last 10 mate lies, in
< hiding a rare Los Angeles sweep
against No. 1 I'CIA and No. 21
Southern California.
The two matches are the last two
that will count toward Stanford's
Pac-10 record, because only one
match of the two played against Pac
-10 opponents count toward the
conference record. If the Cardinal
comes out victorious in both match
es this weekend, as expected, it will
have swept its Pac-10 schedule and
will garner this year's Pac-10crown.
Both the Wildcats and Sun Dev
ils are looking for revenge as both
teams lost to Stanford when the
Cardinal traveled to Arizona a few
weekends ago.
In the first match. Stanford will
face three dangerous singles players
from Arizona St.ite in No. 02 Matt
Klinger, No. 09 Nit Dubev and N'o.
99 Mir/a Duranovic.
Dubev will most likely play .it
No. 1 singles against Stanford's se
nior No. 2 Alex Kmi (18-2). Dubev
is a transfer from New Mexico
State, where he led the Lobos to a

conference championship last
year. I le hopes to come up with an
answer to Kim's recent tear in the
singles circuit.

match up against another giant in
No. 22 l\. |. Hippensteel (24-3), a
junior. Both plavers, known for
their strength in serves, will at
tempt to overpower the other in
what promises to be an explosive
match-up.
Duranovic, a standout as a junior
from Bosnia 1 lerzegovina, hopes to
bring his "A" game against a strug
gling sophomore David Martin (18-
11), ranked No. 31 nationallv. After
a hot start, Martin has lost five of his
last six matches.
"Through the course of a long
season, everyone has their ups and
down and confidence ebbs and
flows," said head coach Dick (iould.
"David has struggled a little latelv,
although 1 felt Dave looked good
against Cal [on ruesdav]."
Rounding out the lineup at the
Nos. 4-0 positions for the Wildcats
will most likely be Pim Van Mele,

The two matches are the last two
that will count toward Stanford's
Pac-10 record, because only one
match of the two played against Pac
-10 opponents count toward the
conference record. If the Cardinal
comes out victorious in both match
es this weekend, as expected, it will
have swept its Pac-10 schedule and
will garner this year's Pac-10crown.
Both the Wildcats and Sun Dev
ils are looking for revenge as both
teams lost to Stanford when the
Cardinal traveled to Arizona a few
weekends ago.
In the first match. Stanford will
face three dangerous singles players
from Arizona St.ite in No. 02 Matt
Klinger, No. 09 Nit Dubev and N'o.
99 Mir/a Duranovic.
Dubev will most likely play .it
No. 1 singles against Stanford's se
nior No. 2 Alex Kmi (18-2). Dubev
is a transfer from New Mexico
State, where he led the Lobos to a

conference championship last
year. I le hopes to come up with an
answer to Kim's recent tear in the
singles circuit.
rhe O-foot-5 Klinger will
match up against another giant in
No. 22 l\. |. Hippensteel (24-3), a
junior. Both plavers, known for
their strength in serves, will at
tempt to overpower the other in
what promises to be an explosive
match-up.
Duranovic, a standout as a junior
from Bosnia 1 lerzegovina, hopes to
bring his "A" game against a strug
gling sophomore David Martin (18-
11), ranked No. 31 nationallv. After
a hot start, Martin has lost five of his
last six matches.
"Through the course of a long
season, everyone has their ups and
down and confidence ebbs and
flows," said head coach Dick (iould.
"David has struggled a little latelv,
although 1 felt Dave looked good
against Cal [on ruesdav]."
Rounding out the lineup at the
Nos. 4-0 positions for the Wildcats
will most likely be Pim Van Mele,
()livier Chanoin and |arrod I cker

ble matchups will be No. 77 sopho
more Ryan Haviland and seniors
Scotty Scott and Ali Ansari.
