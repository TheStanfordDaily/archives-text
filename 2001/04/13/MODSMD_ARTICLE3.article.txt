### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Murra\ House's lot us on issues of race and
ethnic diversity is about to become ofHcial.
Beginning next year, Murray will serve as a
fix us house supported bv the Program in Com
parative Studies in Rat e and Ktlmicity. Formerly
the American Studies I louse. Murray's lix us on
ethnic diversity began this year, but it had no aca
demic affiliation.
I he priman go.il of Murray's new fix us is to
raise awareness of and facilitate discussion about
issues of race and ethnicitv.
"Murra\ House will seek to increase the un
derstanding of issues of race and ethnicity among
its residents through seminars, programs and
discussions," Director of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo said. "We also hope to increase
the general awareness of these issues within the
broader Stanford community."
Camarillo also pointed out that Murray will
serve .is a fixus house, not .in ethnic theme
house. 1 his means that, unlike at official ethnic
theme houses, there will be no ethnic admission

quotas at Murrav.
"To be a fixus house, it is an expectation that
there be some formal academic affiliation with
less formal out-of-the-classroom residential activ
ities around the theme," ('.amarillo said.
Murray's focus next vear is a result of student
interest, after a proposal that it be tied to ( SRI'
with a fix us on issues of divei sit\ was submitted
to Res Ed. fhe f<h us will be sponsored bv Mur
rav's resident fellow, Prof. Charles fa\lor, and
(;SRE Prof. (fordon ( hang. (ieneralh optimistic
about the fcxus, ('.hang said he believes the (ihiis
"has a lot of promise."
Albert Camarillo, directoi of CSRE and
founding RE of Murra\ I louse, shared ( lung's
views. "We have made a commitment to pro\ ide
programming to students who are interested.
We hope [the Murrav f<x us| will Ik- ,i residence
based program not just for the residents, but for
the entire Stanford conmiunitv." he said.
Camarillo added that "(lex uses] are an exten
sion of the classroom, but vou get a different feel
for it in the residences."
Because oft he academic ties of Murray's fcxus
next \car. students will have to demonstrate ac .1-

demit interest in the texustodraw priori tv for the
house. Specifitallv, students will need to Ik- de
clared majors or minors in ('.SKI-', or related de
partments, including Chicano Studies, Asian
American Studies, Native American Studies,
African American \lrican Studies and Jewish
Studies. A L.'oo-word essav explaining the reasons
lor wanting to li\c- in the (.SKI' house will he an
othci option.
"Hopetulh. with the neu [fcxusj, we'll have
the kind of environment where we (an not onl\
he mh ial. btit where people can talk ahout race,
gender and ethnicitv," said sophomore ( '.SKI'
and Spanish major Anthonv ()canipo. "I'm verv
happv [ahout the new ftxus], not only because
I'm a ('SKI-, major, hut because a good nuinbet
ol people from the community centers have ex
pressed their interest in living in the house and
| putting on] programs to promote the theme.'
Ocampo emphasized the importance of ad
dressing issues of rate and ethnic itv despite the
discomfort many people experience when dis
cussing them.
"In mx freshman dot in. Don
nei. there was a lot ol hacklash
against thedixei sit\ theme." ()eani
po added. I thought it was an ex
ample ol how sheltered people are
and how afraid people are to ad
d: ess the topi< ol rat e and ethnicitx.
It's son ol naixe to think that xou
(an t talk ahoul r.ue in out s<k letx."
Sophoint>i e and t in i ent \l in
tax president Kellx \h Ken/ie
agreed. "It's important that
there's .i dot m that hi ings togeth

ct all ethnic issues, she said.
"I I axing .1 house thai dis< usses is
sues related to rate and ethnicitx
generallx is important. It puts a
spotlight on |these issues| not onl\
at St.in lord, hut in <>in sot irtx."
Mthough it will not he an official
etlinit theme dorm, Murrax will
seek to i ombine its academic l<h us
with Ihe tight feeling ol an ethnu
theme house.
"I'm proud to he a resident ol
Murra\\h Ken/ie said. "1 think
the olli( ial title will give more le
gitimaex to the activities, which
