With just loin ..matches left in
the regular season, the Cardinal is
simph looking to ride its momen

force to be reckoned with.
When the two teams met at
Pan be Family Tennis Stadium last
month, Stanford cruised to a rela
tively easy (i-1 victory. But the Sun

Devils have won six of the seven
matches they have played since
then. I hat stretch included an im
pressive victory last Tuesday
against No. I I Texas, which
capped the Sun Devils' perfect
non-conference season.
Its recent hot streak aside, Ari
zona State h.is protected its home
turf all season long. The Sun Dev
ils are a perfect 12-0 in Tempe,
and nine of those 12 wins were 7-0
shutouts.

is sophomore Adria Kngel, who is
currently N'o. 12 in the Intercolle
