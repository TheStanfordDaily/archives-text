opportunit\ to convert that has been a
weak point in otu game, said head coai h
\iu hele I hlfeleler. "We aren't taking ad
vantage of the opportunities, and.in some
cases, it could make the difference in the

In addition, the Stanford squad has
been focusing on individual tnidlield

set a bar lot itself. On die inside, it hasn't
changed anything. We continue to work
