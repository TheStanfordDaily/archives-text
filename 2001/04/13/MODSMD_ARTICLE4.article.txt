### BEN FRIEDLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford in the spring some
times means sunbathing, necking
at Like Ixig and 13-unit sched
ules. Perhaps most importantly,
the school \ ear's warmest months
hi ing resident assistant selection.
As in the past, t here are 300 ap
plicants this vear. I lowever, there
are 173 available positions, two
more than last vear. thanks to the
addition of two RAs in Mirielecs.
I lie selection piixess involves
an extensive application, as well
as two rountls of interviews. All of
this screening is designed to en
sure that residences select "re
sponsible, enthusiastic, willing

JL (J
RAs, who have a desire to help
others," saitl senior Nate Whit
son, a formei Junipero RA.
1 his vear, the Office of Resi
dential l.tlucation has mcxlifietl
the Row RA selection prcxess
slightlv. All applicants interested
in a Row house — which inc hides
all oil-campus housing without
freshmen, as well as Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk— must attend one of
five group sessions. Res Fd st.iff
members, .is well as at least one
representative from even Row
house, observe the prospective
RAs during the meetings.
"We will watch and listen as
the applicants answei a nunibci
of discussion questions and partici
pate in group activities," said Augie
Galvan, assistant directoi of student
management for the Row.
In one of the main activities, ap
plicants are asked to rank .1 list of fic
tional characters according to who
would make the best RA.
The added group session means
that students, cut lent RAs and next
year's managers can now voice
opinions about which applicants to
interview.
"We reallv want the process to he
fair," Gal van said. "Plus, I needed
more eves and ears."
Senior Kevin Jones, currently an
RAin Chi I heta Chi and last year's
Kairos RA. said that houses have a
tendency to elect c in rent residents or
their friends to manager positions.
I le maintains, however, that the RA
selection remains "ven objective."
"I was impressed bv how serious
ly the managers took the interviews
and how prepared tliev .ill were
with tough questions." he said, re
membering the selection process.
Res Kd's changes to the Row ap
plication process were designed to
make the selection more equal.
"I think Res Fd realh wanted to
give all applicants .1 fair shot," said
senior Bets\ Carroll, an RA 111 the
Delta I)elta I )elta sororitv.
Still some students remain
pessimistic.
"Any time students .ire making
decisions and electing people,
there's going to be favoi itism," said
sophomore ( In is Van 1 )vke, <>ne of
next year's kite hen managers at (.In
Theta Chi. "Whether it's because

you know the person, the person is
tunny, or the person is really attrac
tive, there will always exist an ele
ment of bias."
Hesitant to label the process as
plagued bv favoritism, graduate stu
dent John Bilderlx'c k. .111 RAin 717
Dolores, pointed out that students
"trust what thev know."
()n the other hand, lie said that
students' interpretation is not fulK
informed because the interviews
are closed.
"All tlu- candidates are inter
viewed separately. So what some
111.1v consider favoritism mav actual
ly be a better candidate."
While Res Kd has mapped out .1
basic process for selecting RAs, de
tails differ fbreac li type of resident e.
All RAs submit a preliminan appli
cation that asks them to list the tvpe
of house — freshmen, four i l.iss 01
Row house -thev would like to work
for and to write essav s detailing whv
they wish to become an RA.
Freshman and four-class
RA selection
For the first step in the four-c lass
and fresh 1 nen d( >misclccti« >11 pu h ess,
resident fellows, current RAsaudstoH
members review applications.
"It helps to write something
tunnv or entertaining." s.iid senioi
Matt I-vans,a Donnei RA."We read
so many applications that the
unique essays stand out and the dn
ones simply don't."
After reading applic at 101 is. fresh
men and four-class dorms eliminate
a fii st round of potential RAs. 111\ it -
ing the remaining pool back foi
group interviews. Depending on
the residency. RFs, managers, cur
rent RAs, stall members and, 111
some cases, even residents, inter
view foui to eight applicants .11 a

lime. Hi est' sessions trv to capture
several key aspects of .111 RA's duty.
However, the rest ol the process
remains extremeh rcsidence-s|)e
cifit. In some cases, like- in Junipero,
the RFs review applicants' tran
scripts as well, requiring.l minimum
.'*.o grade point average even to he
considered for the position.
"We feel that if students struggle
to manage their grades on their
own, then their grades can onlv be
compromised further bx adding .1
\ear's worth of significant responsi
hilitx to their lives." said Dean of
Students Man Wais, who is .ilso .111
Rl in the freshman dorm Junipero.
At Cedro, another freshmen
dorm, the intcrviewci s usualh role
pl.i\ with the applicants.
"We pla\ .1 sort of game 111 whit li
0111 st.ill memhei s pretend to he res
idents and seek advice from our ap
plicanis ahout .1 possible problem."
s.iul Martclo (llerici-Arias, (.edro

this wa\. uc get to see applit ants .u 1
.uid re.K 1 111.1 wax that is essential to
being.lll RAand Ill.lt iii.in not luxe
come a( loss in the application."
In othei group interviews, the
applit ants' t.isks range Iroin wi iting
.1 general RA johdest ript ion. to out
lining .1 program fc >1 the beginning
of the week, to telling ,i faxoi ite joke
or even making .1 ct>llage.
"We observe xvrx (loselx thedv
uami( sot the group and the appli
( .ints' .ibilit\ to reach a consensus."
Wais said. "The group interviews
give us .1 good gauge .is to how the
.ipplicants work both individualh
.uid as part ol .1 learn."
I'hoin Massev, Rl .it the four
(l.iss doi 111 \aranja, explained that
the group interviews are a helpful
but not .1 perlet — wax to judge
the applit .nits.

"The questions and games give
us s( line idea (>f their leadership abil
ity, but we never get to see them in
ad ion," Massev said. "So, in the end,
we really don't know."
After the group interviews, resi
dences decide which applicants to
call back for the last round of inter
views. In this final interview, repre
sentatives from the house, ranging
from the full staff to only the Rl s,
meet with one candidate at a time.
" I bis is a nuich more personal
interview," said current Donner
RA Matt Kxans, a senior. "They
asked questions that really made us
think, that get .it the core of what it
means to be .111 RA. and tli.it we
couldn't have .1 pre-programmed
response to."
Next, the dorm ranks its favorite
applicants, and the applicants rank
their faxoritedorms. Res l\d then at
tempts to .issign as nianx top ( hoi( -
es .is p( tssible.
"I have been extremeh pleased
with mv RAs each year," said
Massev, who xvill start Ins fourth
xear .is an Rl next fall. "We've
been assigned our top two choices
eat h xear.'
Wais echoed Massev's senti
ments.
"We are never surprised with
the RAs that are assigned to us." he
s.iid. " The sxstein is xerx fail and
effective, and we've received our
top three or four choices almost
even year."
Row RA .selection
flie Row selection process noxv
includes the group sessions, while
omitting the group interviexvs that
freshmen and four-class tlorniscon
duct. flie difference reflects the
greater demands placed on fresh
men .ind four-class tlornis' RAs,

Jones said.
"Freshmen require much more
out of an RA," Ik* said. "Obvious
ly, we still need to be responsible
and be able to get along with all
types of personalities. But we
aren't transitioning students to life
at Stanford. Instead, we're more
the voice of reason."
Following the group session,
Row House managers and current
RVs hold individual interviews. As
in the freshmen and four-class
dorm RA selection, houses and can
didates rank their preferences.
Does it work?
Res Kd's stall and RAs agree that
the application process and the ex
tensive interviews do screen out the
right people; however, no one lx*-
lieves the svstem is perlec t.
"Every so often, there's one or
two people selected who. for various
reasons, don't end the war as an
RA, said |osh Schiller, assistant di
rectoi of Res Id. "Hut to have so few
problems with the number of RAs
we deal with, I think, reflects the
strength of the svstem."
Bilderlxx k acknowledged that the
group session was a "step in the right
direction." but thought that it was not
a complete solution. 'I "here's just t< k >
mam |>eople to really get a lot of in
sight into am one applicant."
He also pinpointed a funda
mental problem in both the fresh
men and four-class dorms' group
interview and the Row's new
group session.
"The applicants know thev're
being watc bed. And, ifthev talk too
much, thev're overbearing, and
dominant and, if the\ don't lalk .it
all. thev won't get noticed. So ap
plicants are caught in a kind of
Catch-22."

In an attempt to solve this prob
lem, Bilderbeck suggested that, if
the house staff received a list of all
the applicants interested in being an
RA at their house, then they would
know who to focus on during the
group session.
"This would take the pressure off
the applicants who are struggling to
get noticed," Bilderbeck said, as
well as the staff members who are
struggling to notice everybody.
Evans explained that, although
he knows "some RAs who shouldn't
have been picked, about 90 percent
of the RAs are realh' good. Howev
er, only so much can be revealed
about a person in an hour or so
group interview," Evans said. "With
70 to KM) applications, the inter
viewers can't meet everyone."
"First of all, we're dealing with
bright and talented Stanford stu
dents," Wais said. "So, from the very
start, we're dealing with great peo
ple. It's actually difficult to not pick
great people."
Still, even with all the inter
viewing and list-making, predic t
ing how the RAs will work togeth
er is difficult.
"Once we submit our list, we
have no control over which RAs we
end up getting," Wais said. "There
is a slight chemistry issue. We could
have three higb-energv. off-the
wall tvpes or three quiet, more in
troverted RAs."
Jones expressed concern that,
for Row houses, the managers and
RAs are chosen separately.
"Often times, the managers
know each other already. They've
usually lived together before and
were elected together," he said.
"The RA can come in as a stranger.
It usually works out fine, but at first
it can be troublesome."

After the group interviews, resi
dences decide which applicants to
call back for the last round of inter

sentatives from the house, ranging
from the full staff to only the Rl s,
meet with one candidate at a time.
" I bis is a nuich more personal

s.iid. " The sxstein is xerx fail and

Row RA .selection
flie Row selection process noxv
includes the group sessions, while
omitting the group interviexvs that
freshmen and four-class tlorniscon
duct. flie difference reflects the
greater demands placed on fresh
men .ind four-class tlornis' RAs,

Jones said.
"Freshmen require much more
out of an RA," Ik* said. "Obvious
ly, we still need to be responsible
and be able to get along with all
types of personalities. But we
aren't transitioning students to life
at Stanford. Instead, we're more
the voice of reason."
Following the group session,
Row House managers and current
RVs hold individual interviews. As
in the freshmen and four-class
dorm RA selection, houses and can
didates rank their preferences.
Does it work?
Res Kd's stall and RAs agree that
the application process and the ex
tensive interviews do screen out the
right people; however, no one lx*-
lieves the svstem is perlec t.
"Every so often, there's one or
two people selected who. for various
reasons, don't end the war as an
RA, said |osh Schiller, assistant di
rectoi of Res Id. "Hut to have so few
problems with the number of RAs
we deal with, I think, reflects the
strength of the svstem."
Bilderlxx k acknowledged that the
group session was a "step in the right
direction." but thought that it was not
a complete solution. 'I "here's just t< k >
mam |>eople to really get a lot of in
sight into am one applicant."
He also pinpointed a funda
mental problem in both the fresh
men and four-class dorms' group
interview and the Row's new
group session.
"The applicants know thev're
being watc bed. And, ifthev talk too
much, thev're overbearing, and
dominant and, if the\ don't lalk .it
all. thev won't get noticed. So ap
plicants are caught in a kind of
Catch-22."

In an attempt to solve this prob
lem, Bilderbeck suggested that, if
the house staff received a list of all
the applicants interested in being an
RA at their house, then they would
know who to focus on during the
group session.
"This would take the pressure off
the applicants who are struggling to
get noticed," Bilderbeck said, as
well as the staff members who are
struggling to notice everybody.
Evans explained that, although
he knows "some RAs who shouldn't
have been picked, about 90 percent
of the RAs are realh' good. Howev
er, only so much can be revealed
about a person in an hour or so
group interview," Evans said. "With
70 to KM) applications, the inter
viewers can't meet everyone."
"First of all, we're dealing with
bright and talented Stanford stu
dents," Wais said. "So, from the very
start, we're dealing with great peo
ple. It's actually difficult to not pick
great people."
Still, even with all the inter
viewing and list-making, predic t
ing how the RAs will work togeth
er is difficult.
"Once we submit our list, we
have no control over which RAs we
end up getting," Wais said. "There
is a slight chemistry issue. We could
have three higb-energv. off-the
wall tvpes or three quiet, more in
troverted RAs."
Jones expressed concern that,
for Row houses, the managers and
RAs are chosen separately.
"Often times, the managers
know each other already. They've
usually lived together before and
were elected together," he said.
"The RA can come in as a stranger.
It usually works out fine, but at first
it can be troublesome."
Stanford in the spring some
times means sunbathing, necking
at Like Ixig and 13-unit sched
ules. Perhaps most importantly,
the school \ ear's warmest months
hi ing resident assistant selection.
As in the past, t here are 300 ap
plicants this vear. I lowever, there
are 173 available positions, two
more than last vear. thanks to the
addition of two RAs in Mirielecs.
I lie selection piixess involves
an extensive application, as well
as two rountls of interviews. All of
this screening is designed to en
sure that residences select "re
sponsible, enthusiastic, willing

JL (J
RAs, who have a desire to help
others," saitl senior Nate Whit
son, a formei Junipero RA.
1 his vear, the Office of Resi
dential l.tlucation has mcxlifietl
the Row RA selection prcxess
slightlv. All applicants interested
in a Row house — which inc hides
all oil-campus housing without
freshmen, as well as Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk— must attend one of
five group sessions. Res Fd st.iff
members, .is well as at least one
representative from even Row
house, observe the prospective
RAs during the meetings.
"We will watch and listen as
the applicants answei a nunibci
of discussion questions and partici
pate in group activities," said Augie
Galvan, assistant directoi of student
management for the Row.
In one of the main activities, ap
plicants are asked to rank .1 list of fic
tional characters according to who
would make the best RA.
The added group session means
that students, cut lent RAs and next
year's managers can now voice
opinions about which applicants to
interview.
"We reallv want the process to he
fair," Gal van said. "Plus, I needed
more eves and ears."
Senior Kevin Jones, currently an
RAin Chi I heta Chi and last year's
Kairos RA. said that houses have a
tendency to elect c in rent residents or
their friends to manager positions.
I le maintains, however, that the RA
selection remains "ven objective."
"I was impressed bv how serious
ly the managers took the interviews
and how prepared tliev .ill were
with tough questions." he said, re
membering the selection process.
Res Kd's changes to the Row ap
plication process were designed to
make the selection more equal.
"I think Res Fd realh wanted to
give all applicants .1 fair shot," said
senior Bets\ Carroll, an RA 111 the
Delta I)elta I )elta sororitv.
Still some students remain
pessimistic.
"Any time students .ire making
decisions and electing people,
there's going to be favoi itism," said
sophomore ( In is Van 1 )vke, <>ne of
next year's kite hen managers at (.In
Theta Chi. "Whether it's because

you know the person, the person is
tunny, or the person is really attrac
tive, there will always exist an ele
ment of bias."
Hesitant to label the process as
plagued bv favoritism, graduate stu
dent John Bilderlx'c k. .111 RAin 717
Dolores, pointed out that students
"trust what thev know."
()n the other hand, lie said that
students' interpretation is not fulK
informed because the interviews
are closed.
"All tlu- candidates are inter
viewed separately. So what some
111.1v consider favoritism mav actual
ly be a better candidate."
While Res Kd has mapped out .1
basic process for selecting RAs, de
tails differ fbreac li type of resident e.
All RAs submit a preliminan appli
cation that asks them to list the tvpe
of house — freshmen, four i l.iss 01
Row house -thev would like to work
for and to write essav s detailing whv
they wish to become an RA.
Freshman and four-class

For the first step in the four-c lass

the RFs review applicants' tran

"We feel that if students struggle

addition of two RAs in Mirielecs.

1 his vear, the Office of Resi

the Row RA selection prcxess
slightlv. All applicants interested
in a Row house — which inc hides
all oil-campus housing without
freshmen, as well as Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk— must attend one of
five group sessions. Res Fd st.iff
members, .is well as at least one
representative from even Row
house, observe the prospective
RAs during the meetings.
"We will watch and listen as
the applicants answei a nunibci
of discussion questions and partici
pate in group activities," said Augie
Galvan, assistant directoi of student
management for the Row.
In one of the main activities, ap
plicants are asked to rank .1 list of fic
tional characters according to who
would make the best RA.
The added group session means
that students, cut lent RAs and next
year's managers can now voice
opinions about which applicants to
interview.
"We reallv want the process to he
fair," Gal van said. "Plus, I needed
more eves and ears."
Senior Kevin Jones, currently an
RAin Chi I heta Chi and last year's
Kairos RA. said that houses have a
tendency to elect c in rent residents or
their friends to manager positions.
I le maintains, however, that the RA
selection remains "ven objective."
"I was impressed bv how serious
ly the managers took the interviews
and how prepared tliev .ill were
with tough questions." he said, re
membering the selection process.
Res Kd's changes to the Row ap
plication process were designed to
make the selection more equal.
"I think Res Fd realh wanted to
give all applicants .1 fair shot," said
senior Bets\ Carroll, an RA 111 the
Delta I)elta I )elta sororitv.
Still some students remain
pessimistic.
"Any time students .ire making
decisions and electing people,
there's going to be favoi itism," said
sophomore ( In is Van 1 )vke, <>ne of
next year's kite hen managers at (.In
Theta Chi. "Whether it's because

you know the person, the person is
tunny, or the person is really attrac
tive, there will always exist an ele
ment of bias."
Hesitant to label the process as
plagued bv favoritism, graduate stu
dent John Bilderlx'c k. .111 RAin 717
Dolores, pointed out that students
"trust what thev know."
()n the other hand, lie said that
students' interpretation is not fulK
informed because the interviews
are closed.
"All tlu- candidates are inter
viewed separately. So what some
111.1v consider favoritism mav actual
ly be a better candidate."
While Res Kd has mapped out .1
basic process for selecting RAs, de
tails differ fbreac li type of resident e.
All RAs submit a preliminan appli
cation that asks them to list the tvpe
of house — freshmen, four i l.iss 01
Row house -thev would like to work
for and to write essav s detailing whv
they wish to become an RA.
Freshman and four-class
RA selection
For the first step in the four-c lass
and fresh 1 nen d( >misclccti« >11 pu h ess,
resident fellows, current RAsaudstoH
members review applications.
"It helps to write something
tunnv or entertaining." s.iid senioi
Matt I-vans,a Donnei RA."We read
so many applications that the
unique essays stand out and the dn
ones simply don't."
After reading applic at 101 is. fresh
men and four-class dorms eliminate
a fii st round of potential RAs. 111\ it -
ing the remaining pool back foi
group interviews. Depending on
the residency. RFs, managers, cur
rent RAs, stall members and, 111
some cases, even residents, inter
view foui to eight applicants .11 a

lime. Hi est' sessions trv to capture
several key aspects of .111 RA's duty.
However, the rest ol the process
remains extremeh rcsidence-s|)e
cifit. In some cases, like- in Junipero,
the RFs review applicants' tran
scripts as well, requiring.l minimum
.'*.o grade point average even to he
considered for the position.
"We feel that if students struggle
to manage their grades on their
own, then their grades can onlv be
compromised further bx adding .1
\ear's worth of significant responsi
hilitx to their lives." said Dean of
Students Man Wais, who is .ilso .111
Rl in the freshman dorm Junipero.
At Cedro, another freshmen
dorm, the intcrviewci s usualh role
pl.i\ with the applicants.
"We pla\ .1 sort of game 111 whit li

In othei group interviews, the

"We observe xvrx (loselx thedv

Wais said. "The group interviews
give us .1 good gauge .is to how the
.ipplicants work both individualh
.uid as part ol .1 learn."
I'hoin Massev, Rl .it the four
(l.iss doi 111 \aranja, explained that
the group interviews are a helpful
but not .1 perlet — wax to judge
the applit .nits.

"The questions and games give
us s( line idea (>f their leadership abil
ity, but we never get to see them in
ad ion," Massev said. "So, in the end,
we really don't know."
After the group interviews, resi
dences decide which applicants to
call back for the last round of inter
views. In this final interview, repre
sentatives from the house, ranging
from the full staff to only the Rl s,
meet with one candidate at a time.
" I bis is a nuich more personal
interview," said current Donner
RA Matt Kxans, a senior. "They
asked questions that really made us
think, that get .it the core of what it
means to be .111 RA. and tli.it we
couldn't have .1 pre-programmed
response to."
Next, the dorm ranks its favorite
applicants, and the applicants rank
their faxoritedorms. Res l\d then at
tempts to .issign as nianx top ( hoi( -
es .is p( tssible.
"I have been extremeh pleased
with mv RAs each year," said
Massev, who xvill start Ins fourth
xear .is an Rl next fall. "We've
been assigned our top two choices
eat h xear.'
Wais echoed Massev's senti
ments.
"We are never surprised with
the RAs that are assigned to us." he
s.iid. " The sxstein is xerx fail and
effective, and we've received our
top three or four choices almost
even year."
Row RA .selection
flie Row selection process noxv
includes the group sessions, while
omitting the group interviexvs that
freshmen and four-class tlorniscon
duct. flie difference reflects the
greater demands placed on fresh
men .ind four-class tlornis' RAs,

Jones said.
"Freshmen require much more
out of an RA," Ik* said. "Obvious
ly, we still need to be responsible
and be able to get along with all
types of personalities. But we
aren't transitioning students to life
at Stanford. Instead, we're more
the voice of reason."
Following the group session,
Row House managers and current
RVs hold individual interviews. As
in the freshmen and four-class
dorm RA selection, houses and can
didates rank their preferences.
Does it work?
Res Kd's stall and RAs agree that
the application process and the ex
tensive interviews do screen out the
right people; however, no one lx*-
lieves the svstem is perlec t.
"Every so often, there's one or
two people selected who. for various
reasons, don't end the war as an
RA, said |osh Schiller, assistant di
rectoi of Res Id. "Hut to have so few
problems with the number of RAs
we deal with, I think, reflects the
strength of the svstem."
Bilderlxx k acknowledged that the
group session was a "step in the right
direction." but thought that it was not
a complete solution. 'I "here's just t< k >
mam |>eople to really get a lot of in
sight into am one applicant."
He also pinpointed a funda
mental problem in both the fresh
men and four-class dorms' group
interview and the Row's new
group session.
"The applicants know thev're
being watc bed. And, ifthev talk too
much, thev're overbearing, and
dominant and, if the\ don't lalk .it
all. thev won't get noticed. So ap
plicants are caught in a kind of
Catch-22."

In an attempt to solve this prob
lem, Bilderbeck suggested that, if
the house staff received a list of all
the applicants interested in being an
RA at their house, then they would
know who to focus on during the
group session.
"This would take the pressure off
the applicants who are struggling to
get noticed," Bilderbeck said, as
well as the staff members who are
struggling to notice everybody.
Evans explained that, although
he knows "some RAs who shouldn't
have been picked, about 90 percent
of the RAs are realh' good. Howev
er, only so much can be revealed
about a person in an hour or so
group interview," Evans said. "With
70 to KM) applications, the inter
viewers can't meet everyone."
"First of all, we're dealing with
bright and talented Stanford stu
dents," Wais said. "So, from the very
start, we're dealing with great peo
ple. It's actually difficult to not pick
great people."
Still, even with all the inter
viewing and list-making, predic t
ing how the RAs will work togeth
er is difficult.
"Once we submit our list, we
have no control over which RAs we
end up getting," Wais said. "There
is a slight chemistry issue. We could
have three higb-energv. off-the
wall tvpes or three quiet, more in
troverted RAs."
Jones expressed concern that,
for Row houses, the managers and
RAs are chosen separately.
"Often times, the managers
know each other already. They've
usually lived together before and
were elected together," he said.
"The RA can come in as a stranger.
It usually works out fine, but at first
it can be troublesome."
Stanford in the spring some
times means sunbathing, necking
at Like Ixig and 13-unit sched
ules. Perhaps most importantly,
the school \ ear's warmest months
hi ing resident assistant selection.
