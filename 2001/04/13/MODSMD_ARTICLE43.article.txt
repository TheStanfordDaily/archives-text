# "Do What You Want"
## Garageland 
### Robert Morales, Contributing Writer 
I he New Zealand pop hand (iarageland lenders a
lamiliar sound on us second lull-length album, "Do
What You Want." Although the hand's sound is lar
from unique, it certainh possesses the ahilit\ to c lev
erl\ lure in listeners with its hvpnotic heats.
"Love Song," the album's fust track, pays homage
to a i one ept (and 80s hit song) that listeners will sure
l\ recognize. Ihe song is not .is haunting as lhe
('.lire's masterpiece, but the ease with which it flows is
unsettling and mesmerizing, lhe incessant declara
tion, "1 11 is |iist .1 love song a ver\ sic k love song."
c ouplecl w 1 111 the band's < l.issii hooks, are immediate
l\ engaging.
lhe band's master\ of repetition continues on sub
se<|uent tracks "Ti .islu .ins and "You Will Nevei (a \
Again." In these-, instrumentals make up for some of
the album's more uninspired songw tiling.

(iarageland is most successful when it wot ks within
the confines ol pop music. 1 lie band's attempted de
viations from this genre simplv do not allow it to teach
the caliber of harmony seen in more captivating tracks
like, "Not Kmpt\
1 his track is .1 shining example ol how lead singer
|eremy Eade's pop vocal styling should be used,
lade's resilience and liveliness are both testament to
the band's success in its native New Zealand and bodes
well lot chances lot .t similar triumph on the inter
national scene.
Still, the aspect ol the album that makes it so
inviting also limits its appeal. I hat is. despite hav
ing a familiar, engaging sound, there exists no clear
aspect of individuality to distinguish (.arageland
from other, already proven bands with similar
sounds. I ven the cordial "(»ood Luck," one of the
album's high points, beat s .» similarity to the Scot
tish band, 1 ravis, which is too evident to overlook.
The track even ends with Hade begging, "Let some
good luck rain down on me."
Nevertheless, the band's success and worldwide
praise as an up-and-coming pop band is much de
served. Its high-energy sound and personal lyrics
make fora stellar pop album. The music is undeniably
catchy and quite worth the purchase.
