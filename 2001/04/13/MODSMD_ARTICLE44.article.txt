# "End Is Forever"
## Ataris 
### Jung Lah, Staff Writer 
When a punk band names itself after a decades-old
home console video game svstem, one should expect
ilu- nostalgia factor to run high. I'he Ataris's third full
length album, "Knd Is Forever," is indeed chock-full
ol pop culture material that any self-respecting punk
kid of the late '80s and early '90s will fondly recall.
You want samples from "Clerks" and references to
" l'he Karate Kid"? You want an homage to "Silh (lirl"
In ilit- Descendants? You want a song brilliantly
named after Nintendo's classic Konomi code, "Up,
I can see up your shirt.

Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A,
Start"? "Knd Is Forever" lias all that and more.
Hie Ataris can't seem to be able to move beyond
writing songs about either giils or fond childhood
memories (or both), yet the new album succeeds be
cause it is. simph put, a great rock 'if roll record.
The band has progressed from its 1999 release,
"Blue Skies, Broken Hearts. . .Next 12 Kxits," because
tlit- variet\ and depth ol its sound seems a little more
refined. Rather than going for the standard melodic
punk sound of rapid 4/4 drum beats and sped-up tem
pos, the Ataris know when to slow things down or
when to throw in some piano or the ever-popular
MO()(i for that emo-core credibilit\.
This is not to say that the record doesn't have its
share of fast-paced anthems, as is evident in the open
ing song, "(>i\ ing Ip C)n Love," which cpiic Uv sets the
thematic tone for the rest of the album: Major-kev
musings on love gone wrong, with a pop-punk edge
and a generallv upbeat sound (despite the woe-is-nie
l\ rical content).
Other similarly themed songs, such as "I()l One
('â€¢alaxy" and "Bad Case Of Broken Heart." are fine
showcases for the hand's catchv choruses and ear
pleasing harmonies. With nan a dissonant chord to be
found, this is punk rock at its most accessible, and the
Ataris seem to have a kind of radio-friendb resonance
without the guise of trving to cater to the mainstream.
Other tracks are ahnost-ballads, with a cheesiness
that is outshined only by the band's willingness to
embrace its tongue-in-cheek rapport with the listen
er. "Summer Wind Was Alwavs Our Song" has lead
singer Kris Roe exclaiming things like, "These
break-up songs make sense again, and 1 really wish
they didn't," while he remains steeped in cliches like,
"|list give me one last chance, and I'll never let you
down again."
I he super-slow, acoustic "Hello and (ioodbye" is a
lament on (of course) girl problems, translated into
life problems. Meanwhile, the swing drumbeats, walk
ing basslines and classical Spanish-guitar riffs of
"Teenage Riot" offer an unexpec ted musical depar
ture in a song about a universal teenage sentiment:
hating cops. And the album's 13th track, unimagina

tiveh titled "Song 13," uses a minor ke\ and \filed \o
cals (" I won't let von get the best of me!") to oiler an ap
propriate end-of-the-record display of angst.
1 lie pop culture saturation of the Ataris" Ivrics could
get annoying ifvou're not into (li.it sort of thing, l>nt. to
me, it's what makes this album stand out. "II Yon Real
ly Want lo Hear About It" references |.l>. Salinger's
"Catcher in the Rye" and "Up, Up, Down, Down . .
begins b\ quoting Ice (lube's "It Was A (lood Da\
It there is a downside to "Fnd Is Forever," it is the
repetitive nature of girl-themed love songs (or anti-love
songs, as the case ma\ be). Nevertheless, it is impossible
to den\ that these guvs are having tun rocking out. II
von listen to tins album, chances are that vou'll be hav
ing fun, too.
