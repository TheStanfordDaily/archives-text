# "Everyday"
## Dave Mathews Band 
### Misty Espinoza, Contributing Writer 
Dave Matthews Band fans everywhere, he warned: It
you have vet to check out the hand's latest release, \<>u
will indeed he in fora rude awakening.
When I first listened to "Everyday," I put in the t D
with eager anticipation. 1 sat hack, expecting to hear an
hour of the seemingly endless jams that I so love.
The album's first track, "I Did It. blared over my
speakers, and you can imagine m\ surprise when, onl\
three short minutes later, the track ended. I thought
that maybe it was a fluke, hut I soon found that the
album was filled with three-to-four minute ditties and
Two million frat-boys can't be wrong . . can they?

was completely lacking the brilliant instrumental breaks
that have become a signature of the band.
Responsible for this change is pop producer (ilen
Ballard, best know 11 for his work with Alanis Morrisette.
Ballard co-wrote all the tracks with Matthews. In the
Februar\ issue ol Rolling Stone, the band praised Bal
lard for "tightening up" its sound. I his Dave Matthews
Band sound may be new, but it is not necessarily im
proved.
DMB and Ballard have undeniabh produced a pop
album, which is a first for the band. Previous releases
have alwavs been unique and have stood out from the
work of other bands, but this (!l) could be easily com
pared to other contemporaries, such as Matchbox
Twenty.
Overall, the album is well done and includes stand
out tracks like the infectious, "I Did It,"the bluesy

rock-tinged fusion of "So Right" and the captivating
"II I Had It All," hut something unidentifiable is still
missing.
"Everyday" h.is some weak moments. "Sleep to
Dream Her" can hest he described .is .1 drug-induced
lullaby. The lyrics are uncharacteristically boring and
bland. It is basically lour minutes of Matthews whining,
"Wish 1 could sleep just to dream her." I he track does
have brief glimpses ot hope when Matthews stops dron
ing long enough for saxophonist l.eroi Moore to work
his soulful magic.
"Mother Father" is also a disappointment, despite a
cameo b\ Carlos Santana. Ihe track sounds like a
lefover from his "Supernatural" album.
Even though DMB has worked hard to create an
album completely different from anything that it has
done before, traces <>l the old-school DM B can be found
on "Everyday. M\ favorite song. "The Space Be
tween,' is unquestionably reminiscent of the DMB that
1 have come to knoyv and love. I Ik-sweet melodic tune
i> cut banting as Matthews 1 roons, " 1 he space between
I he tears we cry is the laughter that keeps 11s coming
bat k for more . . . .But will I hold you again?"
"Everyday" is a solid album, and, although I ap
plaud Dave Matthews Band foi being experimental, I
hope that the band of old won 1 get lost in a pop-in
duced coma.
