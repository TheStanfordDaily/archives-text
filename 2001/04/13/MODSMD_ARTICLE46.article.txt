# "All About Chemistry"
## Semisonic 
### 
Remember when your chemistry teacher lit himscll
on tire in 1 ltli grade? li was pretty cool, wasn't it?
Semisonic's latest album is c .died "All About ( liem
isiry" .iiul is the band's third release following 1008's
multi-platinum success, "Keeling Strangeh Fine.
I lie runaway success of the piano-guitar ballad,
"(Hosing lime," off of "Feeling" propelled Semisonu
into pop-music st.irdom. I lowever, unlike many other
bands, Semisonic did not feel overwhelmed bv us suc
cess. Guitarist and songwriter Dan Wilson said the
band found success liberating.
"(The fans] told us about the joy our music brought
them, but what strut k me most was that the\ really fell
like these songs were helping them to make sense ol
their lives and times. That's exactly what we dream ol
doing when we make music. I figured we were on the
right track," Wilson explained.
Record sales show that this type of music sells and
it sells well (case in point: Matchbox 20). And why?
Bands like Semisonic and Matchbox 20 compose


Semi-talented Semisonic close up
music in which the- emotions
they feel while writing are c ap
tured in the lyrics they spin.
However, to call Semisonic's
new album simple balladry from
the heart would be false. "C'.hem
istrv" is a concept album that i">

ver\ different from previous
Seniisonic releases.
.Wilson has stated that he
"wanted to make something dif
ferent." Oh how those fateful
words can make .1 music fan
quiver! ( I liese days, different
doesn't always mean good.)
Fora c hange. Semisonic actu
ally makes "different" good.
"Chemistrv" succeeds as .inartis
tic achievement while retaining

its pop sensibility. It is an album
about tin* mystery of human
chemistry and relationships.
Musically, Semisonic experi
ments minimally by combining
the latest in digital technology
with older relics for .111 interest
ing and pleasing sound.
All the songs on the album
contain .1 signature, melodic
piano, backed In rhythm guitar.
I lie strongest track on the

album is "Act Naturally," a
piano ballad accompanied In
strings, synthesized effects and
an interesting, syncopated
drum beat. 1 lit- vibes elicited
are obscure but hint .it a deep
melancholy <>nl\ understood In
those involved.
"Who's Stopping You?" is a
Beatles-meets-Steel\ Dan ditty
with an alternative feel. Other
songs on the album mix 111 old-

school elements, such «is the
track, "1 Wish," which contains
an epilogue, complete with an
incendiary guitar solo straight
out of a 70s rock song.
By combining styles, genres
and emotion into .1 solid sonic
molecule, Seinisonic shows that
its new album really is "All About
(chemistry."
