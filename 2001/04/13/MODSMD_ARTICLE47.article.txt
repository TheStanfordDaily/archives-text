What is the concept behind

Why did you call it "Something
to Write Home About"?
bet ause )ini's dad 01 1110111
one ol them — said something
about that one time. We were
telling tliein we went lo see lien
folds live and met Sa 1 all
Michelle (•1-11.11 and all ibis siull.
and |iiu's dad u.is like, "Well,
hev, vou've got something lo
w 1 ile home about."
So it's about Sarah Michelle
Gellar?
Yeah . . . well, no (laughs). It's
111 st about bow biis\ we .ire and
how much we're gone and how
we're alwa\s writing and calling
home. Alwa\s being gone, vou

start to miss .ill ol voui friends. I
see people that I haven't seen in
live wars, who know exaitl\
wli.it I .im doing, ,im(l I have no
cine ol what they're doing. It's
|iist kind ol odd to he gone that
long and i otne hack and tr\ to re
late to things.

How do you adjust to being 011
the road? You're always around
new people and don't have sta
bility.
It's odd, and \ou just have to
go with it. Be as nice .is possible,
all the lime. It's not hard because
it's not like people are mean lo
vou all the time.
Except security.
Yeah, securii\ (.111 sometimes

)iist nuts. I think we'll
just sink with playing
the I louse ol Blues. And
just pla\ four days there.
House of Blues is really
cool.
I hey treat you
well there. I- vervbody's
really, really cool.
I hat's something that a
lot ol < lubs need to woi k
on. Ihe only reason
those people are there
I with .1 job right now is
that we're here playing
a show. 11 we d< >n't pi.in

parking lot doing push-ups be

pumped up.
So, after all that, what are your
impressions of L.A.?

I like Kansas C.it\ .1 It>l better.
K.ins.is ( it\ is eight times t heapcr.
What's it like out there, musically?
Ihe scene is rcall\ small,
f.vervtine knows everybodv.
1 here's .1 lot ol vounger bands
popping up now, but for live
vears there w.is nobod\. We were
ibeonb independent band in the
area. 1 here were .1 <ouple bands
that signed lo inajoi labels, but
then they got dropped.
Is it a whole Midwest scene
rather than just Kansas City?

"N"t-.»11, kind 01. 'cause we're
such good friends with Braid.
Kvervbod\ in that area is kind
of tight with each other he
cause that's how you spend
your liist lew years touring.
(>oing out weekends around
the Midwest and getting to
know everyhodx.
I've been talking with a lot of
Midwest bands lately. I'm from
Seattle, so it's really interesting
for me to learn about what it's
like out there.
It's bi/arre. It's a different
world. A lot ol I.inns. 11 you lived
out here and then von moved
there, vou'd be like, "There's
nothing here." For us. there's
stnil there, but then vou tome out
here and there's too much stull
here. Its overwhelming.
How has the Weezer tour been
going?
Awesome. It's a lot ol fun.
They're one of your influences,
right?
Yeah, totally. I sat with that
guy, Mike\ (points to card
hoard figures ol \\'ee/er at toss
the meet and greet room from

us), the now bass player, in
Chicago, and we talked about
this for hours. I le said, "Yeah. I
know Wee/or kind of influ
enced your band." 1 was like,
"Dull." What band is out in oin
scene that didn't get influenced
In Wee/01?
How did it compare to Green
Day?
(it fen Da\ was a lot more talk
ative. 1 he) hung out a lot more. 1
hangout with \like\ sometimes,
and they're all realh nice, but
the) don't really go out after
shows .uid go to bars, (ireen l)<t\
would be like even night the\'d
want to do something. II we
couldn't find anything to do. we'd
go back to their hotel room,
which is usually a presidential
suite in some realh nice building,
and destroy it.
What are your plans fora new
album?
We're working on it right now.
How will it be different?
We're getting older. All of our
taste in music is changing. And von
never write the same thing twice.
What are you now influenced by?
I'm still into the same stuff
Hip-hop and metal. Indie rock,
too. But since I hear it all the time.
I listen more to rap music and
speed metal.
Where do you want to take the
band in the future? What do you
think about the mainstream?
I don't want to go there. It
would be ( 00l il soniebodx broke
out and did something. Some
one who's not like a boyband.
|ust give it time and some band
will pop up that does it. It's jusi
hard because major labels are al
ways wanting to get involved,
and the) flash a lot of money
around and most bands think it
would be cool.
You wouldn't ever go with a
major label?
Nail. We have total control,
.uid we own halt the label. We just
started a label on our own on top
of Vagrant. We can keep .ill of oui
(ontrol of the band with the band.
Kach member of the Cot Ip Kids
owns one-twentieth ol the label.
We've signed the Anniversai \.
I lot Red ('.in uit and Ro( ket From
the (lr\ pt.
Do you have anymore plans for
your other band. Reggie & the
Full Effect?
Yeah, I'm working on an
album right now. I've alwavsbeen
doing it. I was doing it before 1
got into the (»et Ip Kids. I novel
recorded it and put it out until
Matt made me.


The Get Up Kids rock out with their jocks out, opening for Weez
