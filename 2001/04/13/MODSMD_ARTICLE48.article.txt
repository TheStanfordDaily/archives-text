# The 						San Francisco Ballet
## Is that an oyster in your dancing tights... ...or are you just happy to see me? 
### CAROLINE SAKAMOTO STAFF WRITER 
Lately, it's been hard to go
about your dailv business in Sili
con Yalle\ without running into
an advertisement for the San
Francisco Ballet s 2000-2001
season. Radio advertisements
deliver cloying, modernized
teasers lor productions like the
venerable "Sleeping Beauty."
Dancers from the ballet "Black
(lake" entwined in a passionate
embrace underneath the quote,
"It was delicious," dominated a
page of the San Francisco
(Ihronicle's Datebook section.
San Francisco Ballet artistic
director llelgi I omasson clearh
wants the company's perfor
mances to be regarded .is the
ticket of choice for affluent,
vou.ng Ba\ Area professional
types who are more likeh to
spend SlOO eating, dancing and
drinking at the hottest
nightspots than sitting demureh
m the War Memorial Opera
Mouse for three hours watching
professional dancers, students
and kids tiptoe in tutus.
In that light, it's not surpris
ing that another choice of the
company this season was " The
Vertiginous I brill of Exacti
tude," a swirling, high-speed
production. But it shouldn't
take tin ills and (hills to get vou
there. As I discovered on a re
cent trip to see the ballet, the
proximit\ of the San Francisco
Ballet is something Stanford stu
dents should definitely take
more advantage of. How better
to impress a date than with a
pair of ballet ti< kets?
(lost is the most immediate
concern, although it must be
said that this is one of the few
times when it's trul\ worth it to
pax more fora bettei seat. I he
costumes, sets and facial expres
sions of the dancers enhance the

show so much that they con
tribute significantly to one's en
joyment.
1 hat said, you can Inn an af
fordable balcony seat and rent
opera glasses right in the lobb\
of the opera house, or — best of
all — you can pay all of SKI and
get an orchestra-level view of the
perforin,nice. I lie only catch is
that \on have to stand, but 1 as-

suit' you, having stood happih
through the "Phantom of the
Opera," that vour leet will for
give you lor tlie treat vour eyes,
ears and brain are getting.
Tomasson claims that the San
Franc isco Ballet i> dancing bet
ter than ever, and the compa
nv's "Sleeping Beautv" produc
tion made it hard to argue. In
( ase vou haven't seen the Disnev
version in a while (with "A
Dream in a Wish Your Heart
Makes" >et to IVhaikovskv's
original music) or read the fairy
tale, the stor\ opens with a king
and queen christening their
newborn daughter, Aurora.
In.in inexplicably pagan
twist, Aurora is granted gifts b\
several laities. However, one
fain is not invited to the chris
tening. In some versions, this is

done on purpose; in others, it is
an honest mistake. I he l.iu \ de
scends on the festivities, < ursing
Aurora with death on her Kith
hirthda\ bv a linger prit ked h\ a
poisoned spindle. I lien, in
swoops the Lilac lain, who an
nounces that she c annot reverse
the curse, but can soften it b\
making Aurora sleep deeply in
stead of ching.
()n her Kit h hirthdav, Aurora
is presented with several suitors
and main gifts, including a
golden spindle. ()l course, she
pricks herself, falling asleep,
along with the entire kingdom,
for 100 years. Prince Desire
comes along just about then and
kisses her, awakening her and
everyone else.
Luc la Lacarra, a Spanish
beauty dancing in the role of Au
rora. shone in her role. No one
would ever guess that it was her
first time performing it. Al
though frightfully thin (.is was
Muriel Mafire, playing the Lilac
Fairv), Lacarra has ankles of
steel .tnd an ethereal qualm that
just c an't be faked.
When Aurora meets her suit
ors on her Kith birthday, she
dances the Rose Adagio, a fa
mously difficult balancing act,
while receiving a succession of
roses. ((io ahead: Fry to balance
on one set of toes, with your
otliei leg extended waist-high,
and shake the hands of four men
without moving another muscle
the whole time. Now ti\ doing it
twice.) Lac arra drew c beers and,
during her second arabesque,
looked out confidently toward
her admiring audience.
Her strength was even more
apparent in comparison to Cyril
Pierre in lus role as the- Prince.
While he panted heavily after
short dances ol moderate diffi
cult). she twirled serenely
through nine h longei sequences
and ended them looking as

though she had been enjoving
high tea instead of propelling
her bod\ across a stage en pointe
at top speed.
1 omasson s c boreograpln
foi the c haracter ol Desire
seemed simplified and transi
tional. ft was not apparent
whether this u.is a purely .litis
tic dec ision or based on the abil
ities of the dancer. \ hunting
scene, introducing the prime
and his people, also seemed to
drag. But the famous "Vision
Scene," during which the Lilac
Fairy presents Desire with a
haunting vision of the princess,
was mesinei izing.
I lie women of the company
(iiu hiding Amanda Sc hull, st.u
of the film "Center Stage")
swept ac ross the stage in lovely
white dresses, creating a c loud
that parted to reveal Aurora
dancing solo. Ibis flowed
seamlessly into .i dream world
pas de deux, with Desire falling
into Aurora's patterns, barely
touching her as though she
would dissolve. 1 he movement
was not quite as fluid during

I In* (.land Pits ile Deux, at ! lie
wedding of the two young roy
als. Pierre seemed to be limit
ing the 1111 idit\ of Lacarra's
movement, and slie seemed to
he wearing down, as her leg
began to wobble during
arabesques and she correc ted
several positions.

Although "Sleeping beauty" 's

dances the Rose Adagio, a fa

roses. ((io ahead: Fry to balance
