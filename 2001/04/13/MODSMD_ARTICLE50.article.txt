# Wright's Hanna House, in the middle of our street
## 
### ERIC HAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
1 rank Lloyd Wright is one of Americ a's
most well-known and venerated archi
tects. l'herefore, it might surprise some
Stanford students to discover that one ot
his most celebrated houses — the llanna
Mouse — is not only owned b\ Stanford
but sits just a lew short blocks awa\ from
the Mavlield Avenue cooperatives.
fhe Mannas came t<» Stanford in the
earl\ 19305. when Paul llanna took tip
i esidence as a prolessoi in the department
ol education. Both Manna and his wife
were ardent admirers ol Wright's work,
and, shortlv after buying a large lot in
what was then a very rural area, the\ be
friended Wright and convinced him to de
sign a house, w here the\ ended up spend
ing their entire lives.
Wright, thrilled to be- given such un
conditional control ot the projec t, began
work on the house in 1935. ll\ 1937. and
at a c ost of onl\ $32,000 (still a substantial
sum for.in assistant professor at the time),
the house was completed to the degree
that the I lannas could move in.
fhe house has continued to evolve, with
major changes in 1950 (Paul Manna's
woi kshop), 1953 (retaining walls and a car
port) and 1957 (interior remodeling). Ol
course, with the 1989 Loma I'rieta earth
quake, there were serious changes to the
house: fhe brick-and-wood structure
nearh collapsed, and it wasn't until 1999
that enough concrete had been added to

warrant re-opening.
