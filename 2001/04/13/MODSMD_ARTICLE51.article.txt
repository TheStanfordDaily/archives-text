# Ramin's Reel Deal
## Same bad movie, different bad movie title 
### RAMIN SETOODEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Oscars are over and here
we are — .1 tar cry from anything
remotely interesting .it the box of
fice. And here I am without any
good, greasy material to throw at
my faithful readers.
Alas, I spent my spring break .it
the theaters — hoping, wanting,
wishing for some ray of light to

enter m\ < inema vision. What did I
get? The equivalent of — ahem
.1 total rolling blackout in llolly
wood's spec trum of < reativity.
"Enemy .11 the (»ates"? T his film
w as the most lac kadaisu al cat-and
mouse chase since last fall, when
kcanu Reeves and James Spader
had us vawning our way out of t lit
local multiplex after viewing " I he
Watcher."
"Say It Isn't So"? This in a come
dy— and I use that word loosely —
that shoves enough gross-out gags
at movie-goers and accomplishes
the impossible by dethroning Adam
Sandler as the king of tasteless film.

11 >nit atsl Ins in another com
edv — and I use tin* word even
more looseh this lime — that is so
offensive, so unoriginal and so in
humane that I don't know what else
to say other than that it's more
painful lo watch than getting hit In
a golf ( art. (And, indeed, during the
ourseof the movie, one ol the char
acters is actually hit l>\ a golf cart.)
Then, when I had nearly given
up hope for the film industrv, I
went to see Ashle\ Judd in "Some
one Like You," one of the worst ro
inantic comedies of the year. But
all was not 105t... I got an idea.
In honor of |udd's hogwash

"Old Cow, New (low Theory," I
coined a new theory of in\ own. (lall
ii the "()ld Movie, New Movie The
ory." It goes like this: II the trailer
fora new movie looks like the trail
er for an old movie — even il the
producers have coated the new
movie with a new soundtrack and
new stars to detract from it appear
ing like an old movie — then odds
are that the new movie is about a zil
lion times worse than the old movie.
Still with me?
()kay. Now it's time to apply the
"Old Movie, New Movie Theory."
Case one. New movie: "Knemy
at the (lates." ()ld movie that it rips

off: "Saving Private Rvan." I In <lr

Case two. New movie: "S.i\ li

jokes, bad comedy and bad-to-the
