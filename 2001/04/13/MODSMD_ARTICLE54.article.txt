# 'The Brothers' can finally exhale; this movie's for them

### MIA MITCHELL 
From "Waiting to Fxhale" to
"Disappearing Acts," there are
a variety ol movies thai serve .is
therapy sessions for black
women to rant, rationalize and
react to the confusing behavior
of the black man. Why did lu
lu-? Wh\ did he cheat? Does he
even love me?
That said, it seemed like it was
only a matter ol time — after so
many black love stories created
from the female perspective —
that Hollywood would eventualh
produce a movie about love that
black men could appreciate.
So, meet "The Brothers," a ro
mantic comedy that revolves
around four childhood friends
helping each other navigate
through the trials and tribula
tions of love. They meet weekly,
either .it a local basketball court
or night club, for confessionals
and small doses of advice from
each other.

During these weekly gab ses
sions. we listen in on what black
men think about black women.
From their mothers and sisters to
their co-workers and lovers. "The
Brothers" tell it all.
|ackson (Morris Chestnut,

"The Best Man" and "Bo\ in
the Hood") is a successful doc
tor frightened l>\ commitment.
I le has recurring dreams where
a faceless woman in a wedding
gown tries to shoot him at
point-blank range. As a result,

Ins therapist urges him to face
Ins fear of commitment by
opening up to the next woman
he meets.
Brian (M FV V) Bill Bellamy)
is .1 woman-hating lawyer so
oblivious to the female psyche

that lie can't sec how his
dovish wavs lead women
to destroy his property, He
has a stalker hut has done so
mam women wrong that he
can't even venture to guess
who it is.
And then there is Derrick
(I).L. I lughle\ <>l l'V's "I he
Hughleys"). He has been
married for three years to a
woman that does not satisfy
him sexually. Ile only mar
ried her because she was
pregnant and has lately been
wondering it he made the
right dec ision.
Finally, there is Terry
(Shemar Moore of l'V's " I'he
Young and the Restless"), a
reformed player who lias de-

cided to mart") his girlfriend of
two months. But the closer he
gets to his wedding date, the cold
er his feet get.
So those are the players, h
seems interesting enough. So
win doesn't it work?
On one hand, "The Brothers"
succeeds at being lunny: The
movie is a string of one-liners stem
ming from black relationship clich
es, which is fitting because writer/
director, (iarv Hardwick, is .1 sea
soned comedian.
But, on the other hand, the
story isn't complete. Of course, as
pei the tvpical Hollywood dictum,
all of the characters resolve their
respective issues — but 1 honestly
can't tell you how.
Leaving the theater was like
waking up 111 bed after drinking a
little too much: Vou remember
leaving the club, but, for the life of
you, you can't remember how you
got home.
