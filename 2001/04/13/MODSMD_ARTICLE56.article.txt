# SF MOMA's '010101': Digital art for analog people

Most Net-savvv students have

"S( I MAK. or an
tomated SI I Iptiire
M \Ker, doesn't

even require
user interven
tion in order to
churn out
unique "sculp
tures." whit li is
perhaps Painc's
point: to raise
(|uestions about
the originalit\
of .irt .iiul the
role ol the artist
in making said
art. Kven light
hours, the shim
metallic ma

trudes a lipstick-red polvethvlene
l)l( >b, which then chics into an ob
sc c ue looking objec t, lascivious
and sexual in a wa\ von don't even
want to deal with.
Whereas the artist is coinpleteb
removed liom creating the art in
S( I MAK. in other works, the
artist's clinic es are central to the wav
in which the technology mediates
the final result. Foi example,
lochem I lendriks lias engineered

an optic al sensoi that
records the eve's
movement as n tia
vei ses an object, sik li
as a newspapei.
When the various
lineal paths ol the eve
are then transcribed
h.K k onto the newspa
per, a work of art is
created that is al once
familial and entirely
alien. It lon es us to re
consider our concep
tion ol newspaper
reading as a tradition
al "analog wav ol ab
sorbing information

when we see the jeik\, biomechani
i al wa\ m whit h we realh process the
information.
Decostard and Ralim are archi

In "Melatonin Room," von take
ofl'vour shoes and enter one of two
spaces that, because of the light
bright green in one room and soft

blue in another — ac tually increase
or lowei the levels of melatonin in
voiir body, encouraging von to Icel
sleepy in the blue room and hvper
.i( live in the green one.
Mv favorite piece in the exhibi
tion, a huge Andreas (atrskv pho
tograph entitled "99 c ent." is also
the most traditional — at first
glance. For the past 10 years or so.
(>ui skv lias been produc ing inain
inoth photographs ol the masses:

thousands of students at a C German
rave; a gigantic, indnstrial-looking
apartment block in Paris; the
anonyniitv of a towering Tai
wanese hotel interior.
Ik-cause of their si/e. C'.ursk\
must digitalh remove the distor
tions that Ins wide camera angle
necessarily captures. And, be
cause of their proportion and
subject matter, the photographs
often instill a profound sense of
loneliness in the viewer. "99
cent," a photograph of teeming
shelves overflowing with candy in
a huge Los Angeles convenience
store, is no different, except that

the usual loneliness is accompa
nied In a sense ol nausea and dis
gust lor oui throwaway con
sumer culture.
Overall, I was impressed with the
\ .11 ietv ol pieces on display, .is well as
with the delicate balance in tone that
was a» hieved. 1 here seemed to lie
.111 even di\ide between art that glo
rified technology and art that <|ues
tioned the value ol technology, even
while making use ol it.

Collectively, the aitists seemed
to be saying that, while there is
no doubt that digital technology
can be used to great effect in art.
the jury is still out as to whether
the digital technology itself rep
resents human progress or
regress.
Technophiles and techno
phobes .ilike will find nuit li to gape
.md sneer .it. respectively, at this
phenomenal exhibit, which runs
until Jub N. Students and profes
sors will be admitted free of charge
to "010101 with appropriate
identification on Thursday, April
19. between f> p.m. and 8:45 p.m.


Sort of loses something in the recreation, don't you think?
