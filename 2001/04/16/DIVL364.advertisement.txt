Do you study late into the
night and fall asleep with
out brushing your teeth 1 That
sets up your teeth for decay and
gum disease, and can ruin your
smile. 1 iere's some advice:
Tooth Decay
Sugar and plaque (.1 build-up of
debris and bacteria on teeth) .ire
the cause of decay and gum
disease lb prevent them and to
keep teeth and gums looking
healthy:
■ Brush twice a day foi three
minutes with small circular
motions; clean every surface of
each tooth (hold the
toothbrush at a l" 1 degree
angle where teeth and gums
meet)
■ Brush after a meal; it you can't,
rinse your mouth, eat an apple,
or chew sugarless gum
■ Use any toothpaste with
fluoride (avoid baking soda
toothpaste - the fluoride in it
may become inactive)
■ Fluoride in toothpaste, drink
ing water, and dental treat
ments kills bacteria, and
becomes part of your teeth,
making them stronger and
more decay- resistant
■ Floss your teeth at bedtime -it
removes plaque between teeth
and below gums (Glide is easy
to use but is expensive)
■ Get a new toothbrush every 3
to 4 months, or when the
edges get frayed (the best
toothbrushes are soft and
carry the ADA seal)
■ Mechanical toothbrushes can
help, but misuse may harm
your teeth (check with your
dentist)
It took an act of braveni to go to the
ilentist when this student was at
Stanford, there were more cavities,
clunk ier etjuipment, and cruder
teclniiijues in the pre-fluoride era.
■ Sugary, gumtm and sticky
foods Like raisins feed the
bacteria on your teeth, so eat
these at the end of a meal, not
as a separate snack
Tooth Injuries
Chipped tooth: can often be
easily repaired with cosmetic
bonding agents that match the
rest of your teeth
Lost tooth: Put the tooth in a
glass of milk (if not available,
use saliva or keep it in your
mouth). Bring it to a dentist
right away (within an hour if
possible) to have it reimplanted.
Prevention: If you play a sport
that involves contact, flying balls,
frisbees or elbows, protect your
teeth with a good mouth guard -
one that is custom made for you.
Wear it both during practice and
games.
For A Toothache
■ Avoid cold and chewy foods
■ Take whatever you normally
take fora headache (e.g.,
Tylenol or Advil)
■ Apply Orabase with lidocaine
■ Avoid tartar control tooth
paste (may increase tooth
sensitivity)
■ Don't ignore a toothache,
hoping that it will go away;
it's likely to get worse and
lead to greater problems, so
see a dentist promptly
Tips
■ Ik' aware that tobacco, coffee,
and tea can cause long-lasting
stains (for teeth whitening, get
professional guidance)
■ If you have mouth sores avoid
spicv foods, tobacco, and
alcohol (including mouth
washes with alcohol)
■ Sores on your lips may be
contagious (you can transmit a
virus with lipstick, straws,
toothbrushes, and intimate
contact); use a lip balm with a
high SPF when you're in the
sun to avoid recurrences
■ For bad breath: have your
teeth cleaned professionally;
brush your tongue as well as
your teeth; avoid garlic,
onions, and coffee; drink lots
of water to rinse your mouth
and keep it moist (check with
your dentist if it persists)
Dental Care
See a dentist once or twice a year,
and right away if you have:
■ Painful or loose teeth, or
bleeding gums
■ Painful clicking in your jaw,
or if you grind your teeth
■ Sores or growths in your
mouth that recur or don't heal
within two weeks
To find a good dentist, ask a
friend, family member, your
medical practitioner, or see our
referral list at Cowell. Q
