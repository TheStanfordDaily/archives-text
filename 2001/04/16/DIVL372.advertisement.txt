feared he would have to give up
membership at Stanford Federal
Credit Union, so he never completed
a major!
After finally realizing that "once a
member, always a member" was a
truism at SFCU, E. S. will be
receiving 26 different undergraduate
and graduate degrees in June.
W hen Emmit Smithers Dimm
calculates the tuition he has paid in
SO years as a student he figures he
has spent well, probably enough to
buy a one bedroom fixer-upper near
college terrace The 74 year old E. S.
Dimm was a little embarrassed to tell
his tale but wanted to help others
avoid the* same pitfalls.
I've been a student as long as I
can remember," begins E.S Dimm "I
was under the erroneous impres
k sipn that I needed to be an active
student to be a member of the
Credit Union. SFCU is such an
A incredible institution—so
current yet so friendly—parting
V ways just seemed like it would
V be too painful."
"Now I understand that no
matter where 1 go or what 1 do, I can
retain and cherish my membership
with SFCU I've researched this pretty
carefully, now.The folks at SFCU said 1
wouldn't ever have to go—even if 1
wore blue and gold. Not that I would,
mind you."
With today's electronic delivery
systems and remote money manage
ment services, you can maintain your
