Faced with cutting health services or
costs, San Mateo County is considering
turning to Stanford University or LJC-
San Francisco medical centers to help
the hospital out of its financial crisis.
Hut the two institutions are still try
ing to dig out from an avalanche of red
ink from their own failed partnership.
Still, county manager John Maltbie
said yesterday, Stanford or UC-San
Francisco may be able to provide an
alliance that could help San Mateo
County overcome a projected $12 mil
lion shortfall in the coming year's
budget for its hospital and clinics.
"We haven't had any discussions
with them, but we're certainly open to
any possibilities that allow us to main
tain a high lei'el of care," Maltbie said.
Stanford officials declined to com
ment on the possibility of working
with San Mateo County, which al
ready ships critical emergency cases
from south county to Stanford.
