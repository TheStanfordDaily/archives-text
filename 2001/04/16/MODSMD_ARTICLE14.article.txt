### KATHERINE NAUNHEIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I hose interested in research and stnd\
on the African continent, take heart,
lonight at 7 p.m. in Building 240. Room
201, there will he an Africanists' forum to
showcase the experiences, insights and dis
cussion of c urrent facultv and students with
.in interest in the African continent. Phis will
he the first in a series of lectures and discmis
sions about Afric an issues and events.
We want as mam people as possible
who are interested in Afric an issues to come

lxvause we feel there is a real need to share
resources, ideas and thoughts on the often
understudied, misconceived continent."
said senior Maggie Montgomerv, a coordi
nator of the forum.
Montgomen and fellow senior Negar
A/imi began discussing the event winter
quarter. lliey met with students and facult\
to find .i wax topulltheii knowledge and re
sources together that would not onlv make
students aware of the possibilities that exist
foi African studies, but also address how stu
dents who have graduated can sta\ in touch
with the issues and each other.

"There's no one, single goal for this
forum, but one of the things we want to do
is build on what other kids have done in
Africa, see that consolidated into a group,
and leave some lasting effect," Aziini said.
I he ideas A/imi and Montgomerv have
proposed to reach this goal range from c re
ating a Web site with a searchable database
of past students' work and experiences to
possibh establishing a foundation that will
finance future student programs.
"We clo have an African Studies ('.enter,
but 112 unding is kind of invisible," A/imi said.
"A lot of students just don't know that

money is available in their departments."
1 here are also several facult\ members
guiding the students in their endeavor, in
cluding Political Science Prof David Alxt
neth\. consulting professor in the humani
ties Joel Samoff, and HistoiA Prof. Richard
Roberts, all of whom have an interest in
African studies.
1 onight.a panel of lOto 12 students who
have been to Africa will disc uss research,
work, university study, travel and Africans
in the diaspora. A/inu plans to give an intro
duction. after which both Aberncthx and
Sainofl will speak about .African issues. The

forum will conclude with a short quest ion
antl-answer session.
Both Montgomery and A/inn sa\ the\
are excited alx>ut the |>ossible iin pat t of t lii>
project.
"I would love to see some kids get excited
ahout what others have done, to reali/e that
research and stud\ is jjossible and that it's
not just a dream," A/.imi said.
Montgoinen added, "We hope this will
spark further discussion and awareness ol
Africa and African issues on campus and
help students utili/e the most valuable re
sources we have: each other."
