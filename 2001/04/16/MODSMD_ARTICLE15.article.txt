# Nature or nurture?

Biolog\ Prof. Paul Fhrlich's newest book, "Human
Natures: (ienes. ( ultures and the I luman Prospect,"
argues that environmental fat tors — not genes — in
fluent e the \va\ humans ac t.
"(ienetic: evolution did not determine most oi how
we act or provide us all with a pre-programmed
human nature," Khrlich said in .1 press release. "For
instance, there is uo reason to helieve th.it human be
ings are eitliei nmatch \ iolent or innatclv peaceful, in
stinctiveh disposed to wrcc k their environments 01 to
be conservationists, or horn geneticalh ga\ or geneti
callv straight."
"We have onl\ SO,OOO genes. If everv gene in the
both did nothing but program nerve connections, we
would need billions. Our programming, then, is
stored 111 nerve connections," I In lie li s.ud.
Fhrlich explained that human behavior must be
coded into hundreds of trillions of often-changing
connections among perhaps I trillion ( hemic all\ varv
ing nerve cells in the brain.
"()ur genes have more than enough todo just mak
ing us extraot clinai il\ smart, gi\ ing us the |>li\sical t.il
ents rec|iiired for speech and tool-making and influ
encing a few ke\ behavioral features, such as our in
terest 111 sex and our penchant for keeping track of
who's related to whom, Fhrlich said.
Fvolutionarv psvchologists continue to contend
that genes control our behavior, but. according to
Fhrli( h, biologists have known that nerve connections
realK control human behavior fora long time.
"Some claim that human males are predisposed to
rape women who are between the age of 13 and la,"
Fhrlich said.
However, he continued, "genes are not driving
them this wav."
Part of the proof of Ehrlich's theon lies in the be
havior of dose relatives. In the eat l\ part of this centu-

r\. two Siamese twins who were geneticalh identical
acquired ver\ ditterent behaviors.
"(Jiang and \ng had identic.il genes, but ver\ dif
ferent personalities. One u.is .111 alcoholic, the other
was sober," Flirlic h said.
I hi lie li contends tli.it the development of adopted
( hildren also disproves the evolutiotian psvchologists'
theon. "When .1 kid grows up 111 a culture that is not
his own, he adopts the customs of the adoptive cul
ture," Fhrlich said.
Fhrlich s.iid that our acquired behaviors have in
fluenced us to .k t against our genes 111 some instances.
"We are programmed to out-reproduce out neigh
bors, but how main women do vou know with 20 chil
dren?" Fhrlich s.iid. "Fgvptian women even used ( roc
odile dung suppositories as contraceptives."
Fhrlic h argues that the idea of innate human na
ture — extant from the time of Aristotle — is flawed.
I liiin.ins and 1 hinipanzees behave in the environ
ment in which the\ live. Fthics van from c ulture to
c ulture, and the rules about killing are different in
even s»x iet\Flu lie li s.iid.
Fvolutionan psvchologists need to "get off of the
genetic kick and solve some problems of cultural evo
lution. Eln lich said. "We need to find out win the
Siamese twins tut ned out so differentl\."
Fhrlich cited main advantages to discovering the
w.i\ c ultural evolution works.
"Stanford and Alc.itra/ are both institutions that at
tenipt to modit\ our cultural evolution. It we can find
out how our evolution works, we can be much more ef
fective 111 c hanging it,"he said.
Flirlic li advocates working c loset with economists
.iiul other social scientists to find out more about
human nature.
