hi an fttth i lo make a difference in education on
an internation.il level, a group of Stanford students
and faculty lias developed a cooperative projei I be
tween the School of Kducation and the Depai tment
of Computer Science to design a technology cur
riculum for Bermuda public schools.
I he project began in late 1008, when a Bermu
dan insurance compan\ approached both Stanford
and the I niversitN of Virginia with a large grant in
tended to increase technological literacy in the
Bermudan school svsteni. After a meeting with
Computer Science hot Kric Roberts, work, on the
project began in earlv 1090.
I he program w ill consist of four courses. I lie
first, "Introduction to Computing," includes sec
tions on hardware, Web design and software like
Microsoft Word. I his course has alreach beeh im
plemented and is recjuired for all Bermudan stu
dents. while the second course, "Introduction to
Programming," was added to the 2000-2001 cui
rieulum as .in elective. I lie last two courses, also
electives, w ill foe us on intermediate and advanced
programming
Rather than teac liing from a textbook, Stanford
has taken a hands-on approac li to teacher training
and student assessment. I hose involved with the
project traveled to Bermuda over the summer to
train teachers m the curriculum, and Bermudan
teac bet sin turn spent a week on the Stanford cam
pus. 1 lie Bermudan students are evaluated with
pre- and post-tests, as well as m interviews.
In a countryan which otil\ about one-third of the
population has ac c ess to tec hnolog\ .it home, these
courses aim to keep Bermudan voutli up to speed
in the rapidl\ changing electronic world. Bermu
da's small population of about 03,000 and small
number of public high school students — about
1,500 students in two high s< hools — allow the pro
ject's designers a high degree ot flexibility in the
course structure and implementation.
At Stanford, Roberts and Asst. Prof. Brigid Bar
ron of the School of Kduc ation oversee the project.
Also working on the project is (iaitlin Martin, a re
cent Stanford graduate who, after earning a mas

ter sin Learning Design and I echnolog\. began to
work on the Bermuda project full-time.
Six undergraduate students are involved with
the project, including senior Michael Ross, who is
currently taking two quarters off from school to
work directly with the students in Bermuda, and
sophomore Andrew Simons, a Bermudan interna
tional student who attended Bermudan publi<
schools.
Bermudan leathers and students ultimately
benefit greatlv from their ongoing collaboration
with Stanford, according to Barton, and the\ are
quit kh developing their own computing skills.
One Bermudan student, who learned Web tie
sign in the first course, said, " 1 thought onl\ people
in the I .S. could tit) this." In a world that is in
creasingly dominated by American software and
technology, Barron said she feels the project helps
Bermudan students see that thev can just as easil\
succeed in the tet hnological world.
I lie project appears to have been equalh re
warding for Stanford students and faculty, who
praise the spirit of cooperation it lias fostered be
tween the students at Stanford and the teat liei sin
Bermuda.
Project participants are also excited at the op
portunity to see the result s of their work.
"It's not just a theoretical research project," Mar
tin said. " I here's a practical, real-world applit ation
to the work we're doing, and we actualh get to set
it implemented in out work with the te.u bets and
students."
1 lie initial grant w ill expire in 2002, but hopes
are high that work on the project will continue be
yond this time frame.
let hnologA changes quit kl\. so ongoing teat hei
training and curriculum adaptations will be neces
sary and inevitable, according to Martin.
Martin also said that Stanford would like to t on
tinue professional development sessions with
Bermudan leat hers in the future.
I lie project's current Web site. Imp: 'cse.stan
ford.edu bermutla, will eventualh become the nu
cleus of a larger interactive forum where teachers
and students at Stanford and in Bermuda t an work
together to foster computer education.
