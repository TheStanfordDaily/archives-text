he soreh missed hv students and colleagues alike,
his departure leaves a glaring hole iu both the I )e
-partnicnt of Religious Studies and the I niversit\
as .i whole. Furthermore, the fact that Stanford
lac ks a fully-funded, tenure-track position for Is
lamic studies reveals Stanford's misguided priori
lies and undermines its standing as one of the
world s premier ediuational institutions.
Alter arriving .it Stanford several vcars ago
from the I Diversity ol (Capetown, where he was
a prominent and internationallv recognized
scholar of Islamic studies, Moosa cjiiic kl\ devel
oped ,i much deserved reputation as an interest
ing and engaging professor who was devoted to
students. In addition to his amiable demeanor,
Moosa s ac livitics outside the classroom — ad\ is
ing various Islamic-based student groups and

serving as an associate dean for religious life —
established him as an integral member of the
Stanford community. That's why we are sorry to
see him go.
hut Moosa's absence next year is upsetting
for reasons beyond the personal. I niversity
President |ohn I lenness\ has said that Moosa's
decision to leave was entirely his own. Whatever
his reasons, we trust (hat Moosa ac tec I in the best
interests of himself and his family. Yet, the fact
that the I niversitv clid not make it worth his
while to sta\ serves notice that Stanford will not
always go the extra mile to attt act and retain the
best and brightest among its faculty.
Like am business, competition dominates
the world of academia. lb sta\ on top, institu
tions of highct learning, just like any organiza
tion or corporation, must get and keep the peo
|)le who can best conti ibute to theii community
and help fulfill their mission. I herefore, to lose
such a respected professor to anothei piesti

gious school should cause concern among ad
ininisiratoi s, faculty and especially students be
cause it suggests to many c urrent and potential
faculty that Stanford may not fiill\ commit to
you or the academic discipline that you teach.
F.ven more disturbing, however, is that fact
that the- Religious Studies Department lac ks a
full professorship iu Islamic studies.
Other academic - departments have faculty
teaching various aspects of Islam, such as its his
tory. I his is not just an unfortunate circum
stance, but constitutes nothing short of an em
barrassment. Indeed, how can one of the world's
foremost universities, which draws students
from around the globe and supports a vast and
diverse array of research into human life, not
have an established position for someone to
stuck Islam, the fastest-growing religion whose
adherents number more than I billion?
What kind of message does that send to prospec
tive students and those alreach here? In essence,

such a professorial omission not only deprives
mam Stanford students interested in Islam of the
education thev deserve, but undoubtedly discour
ages students who want to study or even just ex
plore Islam in college from seeking or accepting
admission to this University. Just think of the bril
liant scholars Stanford could have had and insight
ful knowledge it could have produced it its educa
tion. il priorities were in line.
We sincerely appreciate the time and eflort
Moosa has put into our community. We will defi
niteh miss his expertise and, more importantly,
his vital presence on campus as a teac her, adviser
and friend. It is troubling that the l. niversity
could not hold oil to Moosa. but his departure
must serve as a wake-up c all for Stanford to create
a 112 ully 112 unded position for an Islamic scholar in re
ligious studies. Anything short of this kind of in
vestment undermines Stanford's academic repu
tation and commitment to its fundamental educa
tional mission.
