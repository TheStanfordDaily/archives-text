# JUST A BIT OUTSIDE
## Religion not en vogue 
### 
One <>! my best friends thinks 1 am
going to lu 11. He won't tell me
this, Ixll we've talked about the
snl)je< t enough th.it I am fairh
eei tain it is true. He< ause I am |ewish — be
cause I don't know that Jesus ( hrist is the
Messiah — m\ lust friend thinks I am going
to hell.
It's never mentioned and. to tell the
truth. I rareh think about it. It has nothing
to do with our friendship. Hut it I were
ever too n nci him — to ask him il it were
doctrinalh true — he would silently nod
his head.

Yesterday, lie cele
brated Master. I ob
served l\iss< >vcr.
Young, my friend,
has nevei pushed his re
ligion on me. He has
never tried to convert
me. And. \ct, I do un
deistand that his beliefs
are so strong that he

would give anything, even Ins lilt*, il it would
mean I could know (iod 11 k* u.i\ lu 1 docs; it
I could share m this incredible walk with
(iod .ind feel the warmth of I lis presence.
And so. I tr\ to underst.ind.
Our religious differences have never
hurt our friendship. In fat t, it's been quite
the opposite. Young's faith is something I
deeph respect, and something that has
( hanged in\ life for the better.
\\ hen I < .line to < ollege, I was not sure
of my religious beliefs. I knew I was Jew
ish. I knew that in\ mother followed lotsof
religious rules that I thought made no
sense and I knew she expected me to do
the same.
What I didn't know was what I thought
about (iod. I didn't want to sa\ that (iod
didn't exist, fbt feat lie did. hut I struggled
to believe entirely.
Voting not only believed: he knew.
lie was niv freshman roommate, the
first person I met on campus, and we 1111-
mediateh grew dose. I saw that he was
deeply religious, understood how mudi it
meant to him and grcath appret iated the
fact that he never pushed Ins beliefs on me.
Instead, he led b\ example. I s.iu how his
faith made him a better person.
He seemed to always put concern for
others ahead of himself. If a friend came iu
to discuss a problem, Young would sit for
hours talking, ignoring the fact that he
would be up all night doing his own work.
After the other person left. Young would
pra\ for him 01 her with all of his heart.
It is not the fear of (iod that drives linn,
but rather a wonderful relationship that
others should envy. Me onlv wishes that I

and out othei non-religious friends would
have the jovs of this relationship as well.
I have envied this laitli. I have seau lied
for mv own, looked foi m\ own answers
and found some of them — something I
probabh wouldn't have done so earl\ in
im life had I not met Young. I may not
have found w hat he hoped I would, but he
alw avs encourages in\ search and interest
no matter what answers I find.
(iod has become part of m\ life now,
even though I do not follow main of ihe
rules of ni\ religion. I have learned that
these niles tncreh foster a relationship
with (iod, and I have It It a < loser «onnec
tion with m\ Jewish it lent it \ than ever be
fore. Young wants to learn more about it,
too, and he has often said that he would be
cx< ited to go to ni\ synagogue with me.
I his is ccrtainh not an intolerant per
son. I le understands that there are other
people w ho do not agree with him, and he
accepts this. Hut bet ause Young is a man of
strong beliefs — bet ause he is deeplx reli
gious— there are main at Stanford who
would (laim that he is narrow-minded.
About a month ago, I walked Young
back to his dorm loom after we grabbed a
t|iii< k bite. Now the president of Stanford's
112 ellowship in ( In ist. Young seems to (ou
st. nit 1\ have meetings. soan\ time 1 can get
with him is much appreciated. Hut as we
laughed down the hall, approaching Ins
room, his face dropped, and lie grew
silent. A tliei he had posted on his door
about an upcoming event in Ins fellow ship
had been torn to pieces and shoved in an
envelope I>\ the side of the door.
Youngdidn't sa\ anything. I le picked it
up. went inside and moved on.
I was shocked. I low could someone do
this. I asked him. W'liv, that's blatant prcj
ii<lit e. right? II someone were to intention
ally destro\ something dealing with mv
Jewish beliefs, or a minority rally, there
would Ik* cries of injustice. Why was Young
not saying anything?
No. it isn't right," he finally said. "Hut
people here love to knock religion."
And so. like many great leaders. Young
responds non-violcntlv. He understands
that many people here think religion is a
crutch. He understands that they look
down upon those with strong religious be
liefs. lie understands that they ridicule
people who make (iod a big part of life.
Hut it seems to me that they are the ones
being narrow-minded.
