Cognizant dean welcomes
appointment of Long
I write m response to youi April I I
editorial ("New clean choice raises red
flag tor humanities") claiming that
Sharon Long's appointment as dean ol
the School of Humanities and Sciences
is s\ diplomatic of a lack oi commitment
to the humanities on the pat t of the I di
versity. In addition to her many othei
qualifications, Long has a keen person
al interest in humanistic subjects and .1
profound conviction of the importance
of the humanities as disciplines in them
selves .nul as elements within .1 liberal
education. As cogni/ant dean for the
humanities, I welcome her appoint
ment wholchcai tedly.
I Diversity President John Ilenness\
emphasized in his inaugural address
tli.it he would make strengthening the
humanities at Stanford a priority. He
appointed as provost a distinguished
philosopher, John Ktchemendv, who
knows the situation of these disc iplincs
at Stanford. He has also served a
lengthy term as cogni/ant dean for the
humanities. Long, therefore, joins .111
administrative team ac utely aware that
Stanford cannot realize its ambitions to
be the world's leading university with
out ac lueving the highest excellence in
the humanities.
Your statement that Hennessy has
"announced the merger of five lan
guage departments and the Compara

tive Literature Department citing bud
getary and fiscal concerns" is in error.
No mk b announcement lias been made,
In Hennessy or anyone else. I he pro
posal to reorganize the Division of Lan
guages. Cultures, and Literatures,
which was developed in the course of
several months' extended discussion
among the faculty, is still being consid
ered bv the provost after further con
sultation with faculty.
Craduate students in the division
have also been given several opportu
nities to express their views. I he aim of
the proposal is to create a larger unit
that can make more vigorous claims
for the study and teaching of litera
tures. cultures and languages within
the University; build the faculty;
strengthen the current programs and
open .1 space for greater intellectual
s\ nergy among students and faculty in
the various fields of literary and cul
tural study. The proposal is not being
driven by budgetary and fiscal con
cerns; indeed, Ftc hemendy and Mal
volm Beasley, the current dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
have made explicit commitments to in
c leasing the resources available to the
proposed new entity.
It has been evident from your pages
that there are differences of opinion
among faculty and students regarding
the virtues of this proposal. It should
also be dear that this is not a discussion
about whether to support the htintani

ties <11 Stanford, but one about how
best to aehieve the institutional and in
tellectual vigor they deserve as disci
plines within this university. Whatever
the outcome ol the proposal, we can
feel confident th.it Long will bring
thoughtful and inspiring leadership to
the task of enhancing the strength of
the humanities.
