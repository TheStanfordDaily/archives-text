both set (areer highs with l-for-a afiei noons and two RBI apiece.

the rest of the guys are tr\ ing to do that. too. 1 hat's totally some
thing new that we've done.. . and we're starting to get rcall\
comfortable at the plate."
Marquess said all of his freshmen have been working hard in
practice so that the\ continue to improve and "when we get to
inid-Mav, the\ won't Ik- freshmen anymore.'
Also setting a ( areer high of six RBI was junioi Ai ik \ an/.andt.
who unknowingh belted a grand slam in the ( aidinal fifth.
"I didn't even know the bases were loaded when I bit the
homer," YanZandt said. "()ne of the guvs told me in the dugout
before I even realized it was a grand slam.
