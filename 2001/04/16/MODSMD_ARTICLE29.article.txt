I lie first ol the games unfolded on ('..n dinal

Stanford fans didn't ha\e to won \ too long,
as a r.ilb began when sophonioie Kira ( liing
walked lo lit st base in the bottom ol the inning.
I u simian Jessica Allistei ke|>t the momentinn
going with a hard-hit single that teat lied the
left-field fence. I hen. with runners on fii stand
second, sophomore ( assi Hi angham drove a
shot to left (enter. I lie Hears center fielder.
Pauline Dnenas, made a nice (living attempt,
but the ball was lilt too li.ud and out ol re.u b.

Hoth ( filing and Allistei stored on the double,
while Hrangham advanced to third when ('.al
made an effort for the play at home.
I lien, with Hrangham on third base and se
nior |enni Shideler up to licit. head coach John
Rittman daringh called fora squeeze. Mis con
fidence in the senior paid off. as Shideler laid
down the bunt perfectly and Hrangham sped
home to score on the strategic move.
Hoth sides were kept silent through the
sixth, and then the (-ardinal brought m sopho
more I bri Nvberg to t lose the game. Nvberg
look down the Hears in order for the win.
Ilie Cardinal began the second game in
much the same wa\ as the first. Sorensen start
ed in the circle, and the Stanford lineup pro
duced immediately.
In her first time in the box. Mendo/a sent a
single to right and did not w ait long to steal sec -
ond base. With Mendo/a in scoring position,
C.hing drove a grounder to the Hears' short
stc >p. I 'he bard-hit ball was too much for ('.al to
handle and the error resulted in Mendo/a
coining around to score.
Hoth teams were then kept quiet until the
top of the third when the Stanford squad re
turned to the plate. Walker led off the rally with
a great drive to deep right field. The ball was
|ust out of reach as it tipped oil of ( al s Kristeu
Moile\ s glove. Walkei read the ball and the
fieldei well as she quit kl\ turned on her jets to
take second on the pla\.
Mendo/a then came to bat and drove a
hard-hit chopper into the ground that
bounced ovei Nelson's head at litst base. Mor

a stnke home as she saw Walker rounding
third. Rittman called Walker back, and she
dove b.u k into third safeh as a wan Mendo/a
advaiu eel to second on the pla\.
Now, with runners on second and third.
( lung < aine up to bat and drove the ball to the

gap in right-center field, scoring both Walker
and Mendoza.
Sorensen, clearh in pain with a back injury,
was then replaced with N'yberg in the fifth in
ning. Slit' took over tlit* rubber with tilt* bases
loaded and one out. Nyberg handled the pres
sure situation perfectly as slit' preceded to force
the No. 2 and No. hitters into groundouts to
end tlu- inning.
Stanford's bats returned in the sLxth when
Brangham reached first on a mishandled
ground ball to tin- shortstop. I hen Shideler re
turned to tlu* pi.ite and sent her second home
run of the year over the right-center field fence
to make the lead, 5-2.
In the Pat -10, however, no lead is a safe lead,
and a game against ( al is no exception.
I lie Bears cried out immediately, as their
lineup produced four singles that combined for
two runs. Witli the scoreboard now reading ">-
•I, sophomore Jamie Fornian-Laucamein. For
inan-Lau took over the ciix le with poise as she
got out of the inning with a pop-up.
In the seventh, the Cardinal was unable to
score, but it came through as Forman-I.au re
tired the Beat s' No. }, No. 5 and No. t) hitters
in order to end the game and take the second
win of the series.
In the final game versus Cal, sophomore
Maureen Le( <k (j started in the circle and kept
the Bears off-balance until the bottom of the
fifth inning. Wit 11 two outs. ( al strung together
a walk and back-to-back singles In Mikella IV
dretti and Ainbei I'liillips to drive in the onlv
run of the game.
In the very next inning, Cal threatened
again with two walks, plat ing runners on first
and second, until Form.in-l.au entered again
and shut down the side with a strikeout and a
tl\ out.
I he weekend was positive, but not without
imperfection.
