Main of the student organizers come from
i ampus groups, iiu hiding the Asian Amerit an

1 odav from I 1 :00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. in White
I 'la/a. students will pass out white rihhons to in
crease awareness of the hate crimes.
I onight at 7:00 p.m. concerned students
will hold a teat h -in at I I (lentro C hit ant). I lie
teach-in will int hide info? mation regarding the
histt>i \ of recent hate crime incidents at Stan
ford. as well as the I niversit\ \ tespouse locac li

occurrence.
In addition to raising awareness about the
recently peipetrated hate grafliti, the teach-in
will discuss the events as they relate to the gen
eral concerns of the value of ethnic and rat lal
diversity at Stanford.
Besides encouraging discussion of the hate
crimes, a major goal of the teach-in is to en
courage students to take the information thc\
leai n back to educate other students.
I he teach-in and white-ribbon campaign
are "parth in response to the specific acts of
grafliti," said senior Ben King. "It's been two
weeks now since the second incident, and time
is of the essence. 1 he longer we wait, the lower
priority it gets."
" Flic main point of the events is that <Â»l
awareness," King said. "We want to show peo
ple that this isn't an isolated event. It's hap
pened here before, and it can happen again."
In addition to discussing the hate crimes
themselves, the teat li-in will also address what
some students sa\ is a lack of significant at I -
minstrative reaction to the issue. Main have
said that ihc action taken In the I niversitv.
such as I'niversitN President John Hennessv's

letter to tlu- editor to I lit* Stanford Daily, was
not strong enough.
"We wanted [Hennessy] to place a higher
priority on it; we didn't feel the letter conveyed
the gra\ it v of the st it nation," King said. "We do
believe the I niversitv has good intentions, we
|usi want to make sin e they get carried out."
I also think tli.it the I niversit\ worries ih.it
[the details of the hate graffiti] will get out into
the media," said communications masters stu
dent 1m it 1 lamako, and that, "In keeping it as a
low priority. it \vill make the problem go away."
\\ bile I lamako said he hopes that flier (list ru
bition .iiul events such as the teach-in will help
puhlici/.e the issues surrounding the hate graffi
ti, he emphasizes that the general effort is an on
going one. "I'd like to impress . . . that the events
are going to List a lot longer than one week."
As pat i of future eflorts, students hope that
the I niversitv will institute a definite policy on
hate crimes.
"Failing to institute proactive measures that
are publicly announced demonstrates a toler
ance for acts of intolerance, a tolerance for bate
speech. <i tolerance for hate (times," said senior
Jennie Park.
