Here are some comments from a past intern and editor
Intern for the San Francisco Business Times
"Instead of making copies and faxing paper, 1 had the opportunity to pitch and write
several stories. The editors and reporters at the paper treated me as a regular staff
member. . .As a result, I have at least 10 clips and business writing experience which
undoubtedly helped me land my current job as a staff writer fora monthly marketing
magazine."
Editor of the Milpitas Post
"Our intern was most interested in sports reporting, so we used her as our
lead sports writer covering local teams. She also covered general assignment,
and handled several specialty sections for all three of our papers."
