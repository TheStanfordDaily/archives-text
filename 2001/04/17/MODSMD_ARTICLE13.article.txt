1932
On April 17, 1932, I he Daily printed an editorial
about I'alo Alto liquor laws.
" I be first skirmish in the attack. b\ I'alo Alto mer
chants on the town's licjnor laws met defeat in the
conn of Incite John K. Springer. In a ruling .is farci
cal as it was inc\ itable, the judge declared that "near
beer, containing not more than one-halt of one per
cent alcohol In volume, is not .111 alcoholic liquor.
"|ust how judge Springer arrived at the conclu
sion that a drink containing alcohol is not alcoholic is
clittii nil to see. I lis reasoning will be still more illogi
(al when he declares that the new 3.2 beer is alcoholic.
"Judge Springei ma\ have felt the verdict was
necessarv to save the c itv's face. It would be rather a
blow . . . to find suddenh that one of I'alo Alto's laws
had been broken daily."
Bottom line: Wonder how Mayor Jerry Springer would have
handled enforcement...
