CINCINNATI (AP) —
Promising to make polite more
accountable, the mayor lifted a
city wide curfew yesterdav that
helped end days of rioting over
the police shooting of an unarmed
black man.
"Now that the disturbances
have subsided, they must never
occur again," Mayor Charles
1 aiken said. "We have an opportu
nity fora new (lincinnati."
I lowever, the mayor did not lift
a state of emergency, which allows
him to impose curfews and other
restrictions.
The 8 p.m.-to-(> a.m. curfew
was imposed Thursday after
three nights of arson, looting, at
tacks on white motorists and
clashes with police.
Do/ens of people were injured,
more than 800 were arrested and
arson damage was put at more
than $200,000 in the worst racial
unrest in Cincinnati since the 1008
assassination of Martin Luther
King Jr.
The streets were mostly quiet
over the weekend, and city oflit ials
had hoped to lift the curfew be
cause it was hurting businesses.
The curfew was scaled back to 1 I
p.m. Sunday to allow more time
for Easter celebrations.
Joining Lukcn .it a news confer
ence were religious, business and
community leaders who have been
discussing wavs to address under
lying causes of the violence.
"If we put our heads back in the
sand, that sand will once again
grow hot with rage. The opportu
nity will be lost," said Ross Love,
speaking on behalf of black com
munity leaders.
The Rev. Damon Lynch, a
black clergyman, said the city's
black youths do not know how to
channel their anger. "They just
feel like nobody's listening, he

said. "Their anger is not just at of-
ficers, but their own black leader-
ship. Ihe feeling is we're not lis-
tening, and we have to turn that
around."
Luken said he will appoint .1

commission to look into solu
lions. I nlike pi e\ ions groups, he
said, the panel will be able to
oversee implementation of its
plans. I hat would require City
(If time il approval.
