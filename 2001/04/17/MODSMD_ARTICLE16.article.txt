# Hospital stops use of Oakland plant
## 
### TRISHA OKUBO 
I Ik* Stanford Medical Center
recently changed its medical
waste-disposal polities so iliat its
most polluting materials are no
longer burned at .111 incinerator in
Oakland. Students lot Knviton
mental Action .11 Stanford had
been pressuring the Medic .il (Cen
ter to change its j)olic\ for .1 vear
and .1 half, charging th.it the iiu 111-
erator harmed minorities and the
poor who live near it.
I he polic \ (hange :tims to
lessen (he volume of medical waste
burned .it Oakland-based Inte
grated Knviionmental Systems,
the st.ite's only commercial med
ical waste in< iner.itor. (ommunity
residents have been battling the
incinerator for eight vcars, .is the
plant emits dioxin, a c hemic.il that
has been linked to .111 increased
riskoi cancer and birth defects.
I he Medical ('.enter has always
had .1 polio of disposing of medic .il
waste in the best possible, environ
mentally sensitive, legal manner,"
1.011 Saksen. vice president of gen
eral sen ices at the Medical (.entei.
said. "| 1 he ret cut changes] involve
the removal of sharps (svringes)
and sharps container from the
stream of waste that was handled In
the ... incinerators."
Itv sterilizing and grinding the
svringes and recycling the con
tainers, the Medical (.enter re
moved the largest dioxin-produc -
ing source from the waste.
"We were thrilled with the \ it -
ton," said junior 1 .avanva ( lieku
ru, a SKAS representative. "We
worked on the campaign fora
long time, and it felt great for our
efforts and energ\ to end with a
concrete change."
( 1 itic s of the incinerator c l.iim
that it affeets minorities and the
poor tlisptopoi tionateh. as it is sit
uated in the middle of a low-in
come ronmiunit\ with mam mi
ne »i it \ residents.
I liev also claim that the incin
eratoi burns more waste than is
net ess.u \. State law mandates that
some tvpes of tiled it al waste, in
cluding pathological waste and
t hemotherapi remnants, be incin
erated. In addition to this waste, it
burns items like svringes and

other plastii equipment made of
polvvinvl chloride, which releases
dioxin w hen burned.
I pon le.u mug that the Medical
( enter paid the nit ineratoi to dis
pose of its medical waste, SKAS,
along with several otlici campus
groups — iiu hiding (ireenac lion
and People I nited fora better
Oakland — researched the issue,
spoke out at public hearings and
spoke with conununitv menibers.
In Feb. 2000, SEAS sent the
Meclit al ( entei a 25-page propos
al urging it to stop patroni/ing the
int inei atoi and summari/ing al
ternative disposal methcxls. lni
tiallv, the Medical ('.entei re
sponded positively, but its admin
istrators refused at that time to
commit to a policy change.
SEAS then planned a series of
public it \ actions, highlighted In
the displax t)f a 1 ()-ft»t»t puppet
representing Stanford and the
incinerator.
Additionally SKAS promoted
and organized protests both at
Stanford and in ()akland. In |une,
SKAS organi/ed a postcard drive
during which over 100 students
and medical stall sent postcards
demanding a switch t<> alternative
disposal methods.
After nine months ot lobb\ ing
the Medical ( enter, SKAS held a
ralh in White Pla/.a in Nt)vember.
SKAS menibers then met with
Medical Center administration
and representatives from numer
ous Stanford and non-Stanford
groups. At this meeting, Saksen
made a commitment to switch
awa\ from the incineiators.
According to (.liekuru, the
change consisted of 111 ic rowav
ing the bulk of the dioxin-releas
ing materials in the short term.
In the long term, Saksen com
mitted to move awav from int in
flating .11 Integrated Knviron
mental Systems.
It is .1 chance for students on
campus to see that we t.lll eflect
t hange lure." ( liekuru said. "We
don't have to put up with polities
that we find revolting."
Hospital administrators arc
also in the process of drafting .1
plan to create an on-site waste dis
posal facility, which the\ say will be
operational In June L'OOLV
