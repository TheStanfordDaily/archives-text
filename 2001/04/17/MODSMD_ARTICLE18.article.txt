LAS I W'KKK SAW .in especialK busy
Stanford campus. With events for
Queer Awareness Days, Islam .Aware
ness Week and the (lesar (lliave/ (loni
menioration, among oilier events, all in full
swing, students lound themselves with an excel
lent opportunity to lind out about some of the is
sues important to campus communities. We
commend these groups on their ellorts to pre
sent their coininunitv issues to the laiger student
body and encourage them to not onlv continue
these ellorts throughout the vear, but also to
strive to increase student activism In connecting
education with action.
(loncentrated "awareness weeks" are suc
cessful wavs to educate students who often lack
even the most basic exposure. MKdliA; the
Muslim Students Awareness Network; the 1 .es
bian, ( Â»av, bisexual and I ransgender (oninni
nitv (.enter; and affiliated groups planned

comprehensive schedules of speakers, perfor
mances and dialogues that engaged and in
formed the student body. Willi Cesar Chavez
Commemoration, the legacv of Chavez was
honored through performances h\ 1.1 Icatro
(lainpesino, a (lliicano theater group, and with
the"l ast for Life event. Student groups were
able to put together a cohesive and connected
schedule of events that allowed lor topical is
sues to be explored in depth.
Queer \wareness Week was successful in its
efforts to ir\ to present the diversity and com
plexity of the queer community. A significant
issue that main communities face is being over
simplified for the sake of facilitating understand
ing. As Queer Awareness Week sought to ex
plain, an important part of Irving to understand
a coniinunilN is recognizing the immense coni
ple\it\ tli.it exists within campus groups. The
groups involved accomplished this In bringing

in speakers who discussed topics such as the
complexity of transgender issues and the treat
ment of racial minorities In queer activists.
Kducational programs not only reveal thedi
versiix of communities, ihev also give certain
groups a chance to challenge ideological and
racial stereotypes. For example, at Stanford, dis
c ussions of Islam are often limited to the conflict
between Israel and Palestine or discussions of
gender and women's rights, flie discourse often
places the Muslim coniniunitv in .111 unfavorable
light. Islam Awareness Week ( reated a forum for
Muslim students to show aspects of Islam that
are often not discussed. Issues such .is the clan
gers <>l < apitalism, racial harmonv, world hunger
and povertv were discussed from the perspective
ol people of the Islamic faith.
I hough awareness events are effective, high
profile wavs of introduc ing issues to the laiger
Stanford coniniunitv, that three ellorts occurred

during the same week shows the need for more
communication between tin* student groups. ()l
course, this explosion of activity and dialogue is
alwavs welcome, 1 nil this overlap actually de
tracts from each group's individual eflorts.
Also, groups must consider maintaining mo
mentum throughout the vear. 1 1 it* difficulty
that manv student groups face rests in how to
sustain the intensity and inclusiveness of such
programming. I lowever, spring quarter, tradi
tionally a popular time for event planning, is not
an ideal time for holding such events if groups
want to move forward with long-term program
ming because groups, students and even ideas
often lose momentum and interest over sum
mer break. Student groups should trv to orga
nize programming to educate the campus com
munity throughout the year, such that students
can alwavs find opportunities to learn, organize
and ad on matters that compel them.
