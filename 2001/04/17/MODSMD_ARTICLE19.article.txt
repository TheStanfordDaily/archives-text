# DEEP IN LEFT FIELD
## It's time for white ribbons 
### 
You may be wondering win soiik*
students around von have been
sporting white ribbons on theii
shirts or backpacks. I hey are
wearing the ribbons as part ofacollcc live re
sponse to the I nivcrsitv s inahilit\ to effee
tivelv deal with hatec rimes, su< h as the graf
fiti that has recentlv struck Stanford.
More than three weeks have passed since
the first discoveries of graffiti in several cam
pus buildings. I wo weeks have p.issed sine e
I he Dailv reported the incident, but due to
incomplete information from the Stanford

police, !lie* graffiti was
erroneously reported as
"white supremacist and
anti-Asian" when in lact
it was also anti-Black,
anti-Latino, anti-Arab
and threatening to
women. One week has
passed since I wrote a
column ("We should see
the graffiti ") in which, as

one prominent Web site put it, I "chastisfecl ]
the police and the I nivcrsitv fot not being
more forthcoming." 112 lic Daily editorial
board wrote its own editorial calling the
University's response "inadequate."
I hanks to the glorv of the Internet, this
story' has spread .ill over the country. And
todav. Dean of Students Marc Wais has fi
nally written a letter to the Stanford commu
nity detailing exactly what the I niversity has
been doing in response to the hate crimes.
I he Office of the Dean of Students has
been dealing with the graffiti in a< cordancc
with the l'rot<xol for Acts of Intolerance and
1 bleats to ( oinniunitv. I li.it this protwol
exists is a good sign. However, its overall
usefulness is questionable. I hc University
has a pretty detailed, effective, multi-step
protocol for ji ist alx>ut even thing else, from
Honor (iode violations to natural disasters to
roommate conflu is. I he acts of intolerance
pr< >t< h < >1 is vaguely w< >1 < le<l and does not live
up to the brilliance of the Stanford label. It
requires a lot of meetings Ix'tween a lot of dif
ferent people, bni it doesn't require that am
s|xrifi< results lx- produced.
rhisisthe same prottxol that was in place
in 1999. after a racist e-mail targeting Black
«ind I iitino students was sfiit acr<>ss campus.
It wasn't particularly effective then, and it
isn't particularly effix tive now. K.ven if Uni
versity adminittators follow it to the letter,
they may still have to look elsewhere for
ideas of concrete actions to take. ()ne stu
dent who was particularly upset about the
recent graffiti descrilxd to me an exchange
lie had with an administrator over the graf
fiti. The administrator asked him what lie
thought the University should do. His

repl\lt's not in\ job to figure out what to
do. It's vour job."
I bete is noeflei ii\e I nivei sit\ polic \ foi
addressing hate < rimes and no public indi
cation lh.it the I niversit\ will adopt one. II
ilns situation is going to change, then the
pressure lies with us. the students. i<> make
it happen.
I .1111 affiliated with a group of students
w ho have been woi king ver\ hard t< > cdu
i ale students so that we might ,u liieve that
goal. The I 'niversit\ must.» knowledge the
seriousness of hatec rimes on this t ampus in
order to prevent them from happening in
the future and adopt .1 stronger polio to
deal with such crimes w hen thc\ do o< c nr.
As students, we must let the Univcrsit\
know that it's current polities fbi dealing
with hate crimes is inadequate, and that we
want tlieni to make a (lunge.
I lere is how vou can help: (Jo to White
Pla/a during lunch and pick up aw hite rib
bon. Included with the ribbons are infor
mational fliers for educating the public.
Stop In the- table and pick one up. I hen
wear the ribbon for the rest of the week.
H\ wearing a ribbon, vou tell 1 lie- I'ni
versih th.it vou find 11 unacceptable that
hate crimes lake place on vour campus.
Vou tell the I niversit\ that its response to
this hate crime thus far and to hate c rimes
that have taken place in the past is unac
ceptable. You tell the I niversit\ that ibis is
Stanford, the school that vou love and care
about, and that there is no reason that anv
of us should spend am of out four wars
here being afraid. You w ill besa\ ingall this,
and all you have to do is wear a ribbon for
one week.
It is 110 fluke that the timing of this stu
dent action coinc ides with Admit Weekend,
which begins Ihursdav. I his is the week
end when hundreds of high school seniors
are given long lists of reasons to come here
during their brief stav on campus. While
our put pose is not to discourage the admits
to enroll at Stanford, we feel it onl\ fair that
they be informed of Stanford's shortcom
ings as well as its glories. Thev ought to
know w hat they will Ik- facing if thev choose
to attend in the fall.
II lere may lx" link* that we cat Idoto c lefeat
hate outside of Stanford, but there is no 1
eason why we cannot conquer it within the
Ixnindaries of out campus. This is something
that I honestly believe, and I hope that vou all
Ix-licvc it as well. Wear a white riblxm all week,
and encourage all of vour friends to stand
with you against hate crimes 011 campus.
