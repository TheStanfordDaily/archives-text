## 
### SUSAN TIEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
flic Stanford Medical ('.enter
announced last week that it is clos
ing iis hospice and home health
care programs, which provide ter
minally ill and long-term patients
with health care in their homes.
Suffering from financial difficulties,
the Medical ( enter is expected to
announce other cost-cutting mea
sures in the next few months.
I he home health-care pro
grams u ill be gradually phased out
oyer the next SO days. I'lie hospice
program serves 25 terminalK ill pa
tients, while the home care pro
gram provides health services to
220 patients who require long
term, post-operative or other ex
tended care.
"[The closing oft he hospice pro
grain] is very sad for all of us. the
patients and their families," said
Pam \l< larlin, hospice program
director.
Hie Medical Center is making
efforts to ensure that the programs'
patients will still receive the care
thev require.
"We have been working with
several agencies in the community
that have the ability to care for these

patients, and we will ensure that
there is a smooth transition for pa
tients as our program is phased
out." said Kuthann Ric liter, associ
ate director of the Medical ( cntci 's
Office of News and Public Allan s.
I lie two programs combined
einplcn 63 people.
"We are working closely with
these employees in re\ iewing other
job options within ilu- Medic .il (.en
ter," Richter s.iid. I hose who do
not find other employment with
the Medic .il ('.enter w ill receive sev
erance pav, c areer counseling and
other services to help them find
new jobs.
The program cuts are the re
sult of the Medical ('.enter's cur
rent financial problems. 1 his fis
cal vear, the Medical ('.enter ex
pects to lose $40 million at its adult
hospitals .nul clinics. In 2002. loss
es ai these facilities are projec ted
to reach 570 million.
( losing the hospice and home
health-care programs is expected
to save the Medical ('.enter more
than $5 million a year.
l lie Medical Center's woes
stem from a faulty health-care re
imbursement svstem. In certain
cases, the managed t are contracts
under which it operates pav only
cents tor each dollar's worth ot
t are provided.
Decreasing reimbursement
from programs like Medicare has
also hurt the Medical ('.enter. 1 he
1997 Balanced Budget Act re
din etl Medicare payments to at ad
emic hospitals like Stanford.
"We are simply not being paid a
fair price tor the kind of work we
tit)," Medical (lentcr Vice President
Fugene Bauer said in the San Fran
cisco (.luonicle.
Kit liter also pointed out that
even non-academic hospitals are
facing financial trouble. Accord
ing to the California Healthcare

Association, Richter said, two
thirds ol all California hospitals
are losing money.
l o assuage its fiscal problems,
the Medical Center plans to rene
gotiate or leave health-plan con
traits that do not oiler fair com
pensation, Richter said.
Also, the Medical Center is con
sidering transferring certain pro
grams to other health-care
providers. In some cases where re
imbursements do not cover the
costs of operation, the Medical
('.enter mav disci mtinnc services, as
it did with the hospice and home
health-care programs.
For several weeks, a team of ad
ministrators has been evaluating
the Medical Center's options. "We
expect the decisions to be made
over the next 60 to 90 days,"
Ric liter said.
