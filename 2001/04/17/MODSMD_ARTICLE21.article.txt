Dean of Students provides
update on racist graffiti efforts
I Ik* St.infold communit\ has suffered a
number of highK offensive racist graffiti at
tacks in recent weeks. I lie purpose of tfiis
letter is to report on the recent incidents and
the wavs in which I nivcrsit\ President |ohn
Hennessv and othei I niversitv leaders
have responded.
I here have been tour incidents of racist
graffiti reported in the last several weeks.
I hev include: March 15, in five places in
Building 200; March 20, in a classroom in
the C".enter tor Kast Asian Studies, Building
.">0; April 2, on a table in Meyer I jbrarv: and
in a plat e in Building 200.
When such incidents cxcur, a "Protocol
to Address Ac ts of Intolerance and Threats
to Community," developed more than
three years ago, is cinplovcd. I lenncssv en
dorses this protocol and keeps abreast of
what we are doing through niv reports to
his office.
Since the first report, the following ac
tions have been taken: Police and security
immediately began an investigation after
the first incident. I he\ fn lieve that incident
and the ones that followed are related and
were committed bv one person. I lie inves
tigation is ongoing.

After the first repc>rt, the protocol was ac
tivated and a message w as sent to alert over
10 administrators and staff on a communi
cation list developed for such situations.
Stall members were encouraged to share
and to disc uss this news with their stall. I lie
message also recommended that staff hold
discussions to raise aw areness and to be alert
sotliex could assist in gathering information
and monitoring the community lor am
other incidents. After each subsequent re
port of graffiti, I sent messages to update
members on the list.
Ilennessy sent a letter to the faculty
notifying them of the graffiti during fi
nals week. In addition. Hennessv sent
I lie Daily an open letter to the campus
community the first week of spring quar
ter to cniphasi/c the seriousness of the
incidents, as well as communicate steps
that were being taken to address the acts
of intolerance.
A story appeared in the April 1 issue of
the Stanford Report (the 1 "diversity's news
paper fi»r faculty, staff and graduate stu
dents) detailing the incident. In the online
story, links were included to Asst. Commu
nication Prof. I .aura Ix'ets's survev on reac
tions to the incident.
The (Mliceol Student Ac tiv ities sent a let
ter to all registered student groups to en

courage responsible use of c lassrooms and
other public facilities and to take set urity
precautions.
In addition to keeping the eommunitx
informed through e-mail and press re
ports. a number of meetings have been
held on the subject. An emergency meeting
of the Protocol Advisory (Iroup was con
vened almost two weeks ago toconsider ad
ditional responses.
In addition:
I lennessy met with the leadership of
the Asian American Students Association;
• \ ice Provost for Student Affairs Jim
Montova met with senior stall members to
disc uss the incidents. 1 he vice provost also
•isked me to report on the racist graffiti and
our responses to Student Affairs staff at a
meeting last I uesdav morning;
• ()ur new vice provost for c ampus rela
tions. l-iDoris ('.ordell. met with the Asian
American Alumni Association and Asian-
Ainei u .in f.u iilt\ to address their concerns
about the graffiti. Cordcll and 1 also met
with concerned students;
• I IcnnessN disc ussed the incidents and
the I niversitv si esjionscs with University
leaders .it his senior administrative staff
meeting.
In addition, I have a 1 reach scheduled
inv regular, quarterh meeting vmili ad
ministrators and stall to review acts ol in
tolerance, which is another feature of the
protocol. ( 1 he Dean ol Students (Mfice lias
recorded acts of intolerance this year,
•ill of which have heen addressed b\ the
protocol.)
1 feel it is important to place these recent
incidents — and the I niversit\ 's responses
— in the context ol the ongoing edui ation
Stanford has promoted in this area. I'oui
years ago, Stanford established a series ol
"race dialogues'" in resideiucs to i tiled the
I niversitv's ongoing commitment to pro
moting and sustaining a health\ and re
spectful community, Lwoyears ago, Assis
tant Dean of Students loinim Lee Woon
developed a video, "Wedges and Splinters:
Acts ol Intolerance on C.ampus," and has
systematicalh led discussions with units
across campus about the- realities of such
threats tocommuuit\. In addition, over the

course of the last two years, Woon has met
with resident assistants, the ethnic staff to
rn ins and police — among others — to de
velop a coherent and responsive program
in dealing with acts ol intolerance.
In closing. 1 would like to say that the
I niversitv is not only working vigorously to
address these incidents, it is doing its best to
balance divergent views about how we
should appropriately respond. Some mem
bers of the community leel it is important to
publicize details of the recent incidents
u idel\. and spet ificalh to students, to keep
the issues involved at the forefront and to
educate as manv people as possible. The
polite, on the other hand, typically have
more success apprehending the perpetra
te >is of snt h acts when the specifics of the in
cidents are not widelv circulated. Other
members ol the community leel that to hit -
thei publu i/e the incidents gives perpetra
tors exacth the tvpe ol notoriety they desire
and int l eases the likelihood of further inci
dents. We max respectfully disagree about
whit h is the appropriate response, but I be
lieve it is hurtful to the community to sug
gest that one group or another cares less
about addressing the incidents and their
underlying causes. And, moreover, it ere

ates the type of divisiveness that people who
commit such acts of intolerance hope to
achieve.
It is impossible tor any single leader or
campus entity to put an end to these ac ts of
intolerance. 1 lowever, we can deter and ad
dress them constructively when we find
ways to mobilize all of the g<x>d intentions
that exist in our community. In that spirit,
we applaud the efforts students are making
to constructively discuss and address this
most recent outbreak of racist graffiti. As
Hennessv said in his open letter, "Actions
such as these diminish all of us in the Stan
ford community — not just those who are
targets of the hateful ac ts. Consequently, all
of us must unite in our rejection of such be
havior and do our utmost to see that our
community is a sate and hospitable place tor
all of its members."

Long a 'brilliant 7 and 'timely'
choice for H&S dean
You sav tht- appointment ol Biological

Sciences Prof. Sharon Long as dean of hu
manities and sciences is a questionable
choice because she comes from a biolog\
background ("New dean choice rakes red
flag for humanities," April 11). According to
your logic, this raises serious quest ions alxmt
Stanford's commitment to the humanities.
If that were true, Aristotle, if he were
alive today, would not qualify to be dean
of humanities and sciences at Stanford.
After .ill he authored a philosophic and
scientific system that covered most of the
sciences and its arts. That's almost every
thing we now consider as a humanities ed
ucation — biology, philosophy, psycholo
gy, political theory, ethics, logic, meta
physics, literary theory, rhetoric and even
chemistry and physics.
I his system is what the humanities are
primarily concerned about —to enable iin
to examine our world with reference to
human meaning and purpose as opposed to
merely its physic al laws.
University President John Hennessv's
choice of a biologist to lead the humanities is
not only brilliant but timely. Rapid progress
in the physical and molecular sciences re
quires new approaches based on the propa
gation of a self-sufficient system of human

values tor future generations. One cannot
tliiuk of a more qualified individual to lead
this ettort than a biologist.

Dean of Students provides
update on racist graffiti efforts
I Ik* St.infold communit\ has suffered a
number of highK offensive racist graffiti at
tacks in recent weeks. I lie purpose of tfiis
letter is to report on the recent incidents and
the wavs in which I nivcrsit\ President |ohn
Hennessv and othei I niversitv leaders
have responded.
I here have been tour incidents of racist
graffiti reported in the last several weeks.
I hev include: March 15, in five places in
Building 200; March 20, in a classroom in
the C".enter tor Kast Asian Studies, Building
.">0; April 2, on a table in Meyer I jbrarv: and
in a plat e in Building 200.
When such incidents cxcur, a "Protocol
to Address Ac ts of Intolerance and Threats
to Community," developed more than
three years ago, is cinplovcd. I lenncssv en
dorses this protocol and keeps abreast of
what we are doing through niv reports to
his office.
Since the first report, the following ac
tions have been taken: Police and security
immediately began an investigation after
the first incident. I he\ fn lieve that incident
and the ones that followed are related and
were committed bv one person. I lie inves
tigation is ongoing.

After the first repc>rt, the protocol was ac
tivated and a message w as sent to alert over
10 administrators and staff on a communi
cation list developed for such situations.
Stall members were encouraged to share
and to disc uss this news with their stall. I lie
message also recommended that staff hold
discussions to raise aw areness and to be alert
sotliex could assist in gathering information
and monitoring the community lor am
other incidents. After each subsequent re
port of graffiti, I sent messages to update
members on the list.
Ilennessy sent a letter to the faculty
notifying them of the graffiti during fi
nals week. In addition. Hennessv sent
I lie Daily an open letter to the campus
community the first week of spring quar
ter to cniphasi/c the seriousness of the
incidents, as well as communicate steps
that were being taken to address the acts
of intolerance.
A story appeared in the April 1 issue of
the Stanford Report (the 1 "diversity's news
paper fi»r faculty, staff and graduate stu
dents) detailing the incident. In the online
story, links were included to Asst. Commu
nication Prof. I .aura Ix'ets's survev on reac
tions to the incident.
The (Mliceol Student Ac tiv ities sent a let
ter to all registered student groups to en

courage responsible use of c lassrooms and
other public facilities and to take set urity
precautions.
In addition to keeping the eommunitx
informed through e-mail and press re
ports. a number of meetings have been
held on the subject. An emergency meeting
of the Protocol Advisory (Iroup was con
vened almost two weeks ago toconsider ad
ditional responses.
In addition:
I lennessy met with the leadership of
the Asian American Students Association;
• \ ice Provost for Student Affairs Jim
Montova met with senior stall members to
disc uss the incidents. 1 he vice provost also
•isked me to report on the racist graffiti and
our responses to Student Affairs staff at a
meeting last I uesdav morning;
• ()ur new vice provost for c ampus rela
tions. l-iDoris ('.ordell. met with the Asian
American Alumni Association and Asian-
Ainei u .in f.u iilt\ to address their concerns
about the graffiti. Cordcll and 1 also met
with concerned students;
• I IcnnessN disc ussed the incidents and
the I niversitv si esjionscs with University
leaders .it his senior administrative staff
meeting.
In addition, I have a 1 reach scheduled
inv regular, quarterh meeting vmili ad
ministrators and stall to review acts ol in
tolerance, which is another feature of the
protocol. ( 1 he Dean ol Students (Mfice lias
recorded acts of intolerance this year,
•ill of which have heen addressed b\ the
protocol.)
1 feel it is important to place these recent
incidents — and the I niversit\ 's responses
— in the context ol the ongoing edui ation
Stanford has promoted in this area. I'oui
years ago, Stanford established a series ol
"race dialogues'" in resideiucs to i tiled the
I niversitv's ongoing commitment to pro
moting and sustaining a health\ and re
spectful community, Lwoyears ago, Assis
tant Dean of Students loinim Lee Woon
developed a video, "Wedges and Splinters:
Acts ol Intolerance on C.ampus," and has
systematicalh led discussions with units
across campus about the- realities of such
threats tocommuuit\. In addition, over the

course of the last two years, Woon has met
with resident assistants, the ethnic staff to
rn ins and police — among others — to de
velop a coherent and responsive program
in dealing with acts ol intolerance.
In closing. 1 would like to say that the
I niversitv is not only working vigorously to
address these incidents, it is doing its best to
balance divergent views about how we
should appropriately respond. Some mem
bers of the community leel it is important to
publicize details of the recent incidents
u idel\. and spet ificalh to students, to keep
the issues involved at the forefront and to
educate as manv people as possible. The
polite, on the other hand, typically have
more success apprehending the perpetra
te >is of snt h acts when the specifics of the in
cidents are not widelv circulated. Other
members ol the community leel that to hit -
thei publu i/e the incidents gives perpetra
tors exacth the tvpe ol notoriety they desire
and int l eases the likelihood of further inci

whit h is the appropriate response, but I be
lieve it is hurtful to the community to sug
gest that one group or another cares less
about addressing the incidents and their
underlying causes. And, moreover, it ere

ates the type of divisiveness that people who
commit such acts of intolerance hope to

It is impossible tor any single leader or
