### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Sen. Jesse Helms lias
complained about Mexico for years, calling its drug
fighting efforts inadequate and its government cor
rupt. Mexican officials — including the current for
eign secretary — have responded with their own
barrage of criticism.
The two sides are putting aside their
differences — or .it least discussing them — with
the start of a three-day visit to Mexico ('.ity by I lelins
.md four other I S. senators, all of whom arrived
yesterday.
Helms is leading a delegation from the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in a historic joint
meeting with its Mexican counterpart. 1 lie senators
also planned to meet with President Vicente Fox.
I lie visit. I lelins said, is a way to "help solidify the
emerging friendship between our two govern
ments," and it is part of a decidedly different tone
from vears past.
Helms, a North Carolina Republican who is one
of Cuba's most vocal opponents, lias denounced
Mexico's ties to the communist island. I fe also voted
against the North American Free I rade Agreement
and opposed a I'.S. rescue of Mexico's economy
during the HMK r ) peso crisis.
For liis part, Mexican Foreign Secretary |orge
('.astaneda once called the I lelms-Hurton law — de
signed to punish foreign companies investing in
(luba — an "absurd tragicomedy."
Hut things have changed in Mexico, and both
sides appear to be responding.
When Fox took office Dec. I.he ended 71 years
of rule b\ the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Although the new president has appealed to the
left b\ sending .111 Indian rights bill to ('.ongress and

promising lo restart stalled peace talks with the Zap
atista rebels, the former Coca-Cola executive is also
.1 devout Roman Catholic and a member of the con
servative National Action Partv.
His administration has been received favorably
In many Republicans in the United States.
Mexico was President George W. Bush's first for
eign trip after taking office. I le and Fox spent a dav
at the Mexican president's ranch, pledging closer co
operation against drug smuggling, energv shortages
and immigration problems. *
In January, a delegation of I .S. senators led by
lex as Republican Phil Gramm proposed a guest
worker program to bring Mexican workers legally
into the I nited States.
Helms has said tomorrow's meeting with Mexi
can legislators "will be, to the best of our knowledge,
the first time in history that a committee of the I S.
Congress lias held a joint meeting on foreign soil
with a committee of another nation's congress or
parliament."
|oining Helms are Sens. Joseph Biden, l)-l)el.;
('.buck I fagel, R-Neb.; ('.hristophcr Dodd, l)-(lonn.,
and John Knsign, R-Nev. I hev are expected to dis
cuss immigr ation, drug smuggling and trade.
Fox has urged I .S. officials to allow more Mexi
can workers and to legalize those already there —
an idea that I Iclms doesn't seem to support.
However, Helms' committee passed .1 bill earlier
this month tli.it would eliminate the demand that
U.S. presidents rate countries on their efforts to
combat drug traffic king.
Mexico, and most other nations, have denounc ed
the certification program as hypocritical coining
from the world's largest drug-consuming nation.
