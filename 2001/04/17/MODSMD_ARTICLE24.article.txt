## Inside the zone inside my head 
### 
When ilu' NBA pub
licly ac knowledged
a couple of months
ago that they were
going to possibly eliminate the
ambiguous illegal defense viola
tion, many people, inc hiding my
self, did not know what to think.

l)id the pros
outweigh the
cons?
After the NBA
made /one de
fenses officialh
legal bv eliminat
ing the ever
changing illegal
defense rules last

week, I am still divided about
whether this will help save or de
stroy the N BA.
With every optimistic or pes
simistic thought. I can hear .1
rebuttal from niv imaginary
alter ego.
This will kill the NBA.
No, it won't.
Yes, it will, like Charles
Barklev said. "The\ |ust made the
world safe for c rappy plavers."
/ said, no! Abolishing illegal de
fenses will improve the NHA.
Zone defenses are going to
slow down the game even more.
It is like trying to increase stor
ing in hockey with the neutral
zone trap.
No, it\ not. Most NBA teams
will not consistently use the zone be
cause NBA players will destroy it.
With the new rule, there will be less
stagnant isolation (days and more
ball movement between all five
members of the team, a novel con
cept called teamwork.

It is still frightening to imag
ine an N BA schedule full ot tem
ple vs. Princeton wars of .(tui
tion. When the Heat battle the
Knit ks. will the score be in the
40s?
No, stupid. In college, games can
be more stagimnt because of the 35-
second shot clock. With a 24-second
shot dock, scoring might ei'en in
crease. Plus, anything is better than
today's "milking even second of the
shot-clock " style of {day.
In order to prevent four play
ers from spotting up and draw
ing the other defenders away
from the ball, the NBA is now
going to allow teams to double
and triple-team their marquee
players.
You are assuming that even team
will only (day zone, and that is non
sense. The best college teams don't
even /day zone all the time. Eliminat
ing illegal defenses will simply give
coaches more choices on defense.
Like that is what we needed:
|eft Van Guildv with more ( hon -
es on defense.
You don't understand!
No, 1 don't. This will dilute the
NBA stvle of plav. I'liese gim
mick defenses will eliminate ac -
robatic one-on-one moves. And
forget seeing Vince Garter and
Kobe Brvant drive the lane and
inventing acrobatic dunks. For
get Showtime.
Actually, coaches. who will also
have to earn their money by actually
coaching instead of calling iso, iso, iso
and iso, will realize that they will need
to beat the defense dtnvn the court be


Anthony Lee
fort' the defenders set up This will
lead hi more fust-breaks, which will
provide more open-court skill mid
dunks than there are in today s frame.
I here is also going to he a defensive
three-second rule, so it will still he
possible to dear the hine for drives.
Don't worn, Showtime will come
hack.
I still think the \II.\ is going to
have .1 It.ikl time marketing the
game. Instead of Yinte ( .liter
and Kobe Bryant, sharpshooters
Steve Kerr and Brent Barn and
|on Barry and Danny Fern are

going to be the new stars. And
these guvs are .ill white!
What's your point? three-point
shots are not going to he falling like
rain in Oregon. The best way to beat a
tone is to get the ball inside oi attack
it before it sets up. Besides, NBA
loaches are not going to implement a
2-1 zone because the XHA has so
many players capable of making the
open jumper.
M\ point was that there might
be another troubling reason un
derlying this new rule ehange.
I he NBA already airbrushes
Allen l\erson's tattoos and pro
hibits st\ Irs th.it families shooting
.it peach baskets in Indiana
would find different.
Don 't even!?

Now the /one defenses will
allow more while plavers to
flourish in the NBA. Keith Van
Horn .md l)irk Nowit/ki may be
elevated to the next stratos
phere. Notre Dame's Trov Mur
phy and Stanford's Casev |acob
sen may be superstars because
the /one could prevent these
fundament.illv sound plavers
from getting exploited In (puck
er slashers. I his m.iv start to
bleach the NBA.
You are an idiot, an absolute
moron. Stop playing the rare raid.
'It was just some food for
thought.
If 112//, llir zone defense will allow
players to flourish in the NBA. It
won't iust he white players, though.

Fundamentally. sound players will
flourish. Basketball players will actu
ally be required to pass, move, make
wise derisions, and think on the spot.
Isn 't that amazing?
People want to see dunks,
however. Zone defenses dilute
athleticism.
I'lien so be it. Overathletu ism ami
the one-on-one, mano-a-mano men
tality is destroying the game. I'rosperts
practice more time perfecting their
double-pump windmills than they do
solid bourne passes, /'layers throw
more passes off of their elbows than
their chests. The zone may improve the
college game as well, forcing super
stars to stay in an extra year to perfect
their fundamentals.
But what about now? There

are so many teams who have
drafted the "best athlete avail
able." What will happen to the
league next vear when athletes
tr\ to learn how to be basketball
players? The N BA is going to be a
developmental league producing
C.BA-quality games.
Well, we may have to take two
giant steps backwards to go forward.
Eliminating illegal defense will be
considered to have been revolutionary
in the long run.
I sure hope so.

Anthony Ise, a sophomore, also be
lieves the XHA should widen the court
to create more spacing for today s big
ger and faster players. He ran be

league next vear when athletes
tr\ to learn how to be basketball
players? The N BA is going to be a
developmental league producing
C.BA-quality games.
Well, we may have to take two
giant steps backwards to go forward.
Eliminating illegal defense will be
considered to have been revolutionary
in the long run.
I sure hope so.

When ilu' NBA pub
licly ac knowledged
a couple of months
ago that they were
going to possibly eliminate the
ambiguous illegal defense viola
tion, many people, inc hiding my
self, did not know what to think.

l)id the pros
outweigh the
cons?
After the NBA
made /one de
fenses officialh
legal bv eliminat
ing the ever
changing illegal
defense rules last

week, I am still divided about
whether this will help save or de
stroy the N BA.
With every optimistic or pes
simistic thought. I can hear .1
rebuttal from niv imaginary
alter ego.
This will kill the NBA.
No, it won't.
Yes, it will, like Charles
Barklev said. "The\ |ust made the
world safe for c rappy plavers."
/ said, no! Abolishing illegal de
fenses will improve the NHA.
Zone defenses are going to
slow down the game even more.
It is like trying to increase stor
ing in hockey with the neutral
zone trap.
No, it\ not. Most NBA teams
will not consistently use the zone be
cause NBA players will destroy it.
With the new rule, there will be less
stagnant isolation (days and more
ball movement between all five
members of the team, a novel con
cept called teamwork.

It is still frightening to imag
ine an N BA schedule full ot tem
ple vs. Princeton wars of .(tui
tion. When the Heat battle the
Knit ks. will the score be in the
40s?
No, stupid. In college, games can
be more stagimnt because of the 35-
second shot clock. With a 24-second
shot dock, scoring might ei'en in
crease. Plus, anything is better than
today's "milking even second of the
shot-clock " style of {day.
In order to prevent four play
ers from spotting up and draw
ing the other defenders away
from the ball, the NBA is now
going to allow teams to double
and triple-team their marquee
players.
You are assuming that even team
will only (day zone, and that is non
sense. The best college teams don't
even /day zone all the time. Eliminat
ing illegal defenses will simply give
coaches more choices on defense.
Like that is what we needed:
|eft Van Guildv with more ( hon -
es on defense.
You don't understand!
No, 1 don't. This will dilute the
NBA stvle of plav. I'liese gim
mick defenses will eliminate ac -
robatic one-on-one moves. And
forget seeing Vince Garter and
Kobe Brvant drive the lane and
inventing acrobatic dunks. For
get Showtime.
Actually, coaches. who will also
have to earn their money by actually
coaching instead of calling iso, iso, iso
and iso, will realize that they will need
to beat the defense dtnvn the court be


Anthony Lee
fort' the defenders set up This will
lead hi more fust-breaks, which will
provide more open-court skill mid
dunks than there are in today s frame.
I here is also going to he a defensive
three-second rule, so it will still he
possible to dear the hine for drives.
Don't worn, Showtime will come
hack.
I still think the \II.\ is going to
have .1 It.ikl time marketing the
game. Instead of Yinte ( .liter
and Kobe Bryant, sharpshooters
Steve Kerr and Brent Barn and
|on Barry and Danny Fern are

going to be the new stars. And
these guvs are .ill white!
What's your point? three-point
shots are not going to he falling like
rain in Oregon. The best way to beat a
tone is to get the ball inside oi attack
it before it sets up. Besides, NBA
loaches are not going to implement a
2-1 zone because the XHA has so
many players capable of making the
open jumper.
M\ point was that there might
be another troubling reason un
derlying this new rule ehange.
I he NBA already airbrushes
Allen l\erson's tattoos and pro
hibits st\ Irs th.it families shooting
.it peach baskets in Indiana
would find different.
Don 't even!?

Now the /one defenses will
allow more while plavers to
flourish in the NBA. Keith Van
Horn .md l)irk Nowit/ki may be
elevated to the next stratos
phere. Notre Dame's Trov Mur
phy and Stanford's Casev |acob
sen may be superstars because
the /one could prevent these
fundament.illv sound plavers
from getting exploited In (puck
er slashers. I his m.iv start to
bleach the NBA.
You are an idiot, an absolute
moron. Stop playing the rare raid.
'It was just some food for
thought.
If 112//, llir zone defense will allow
players to flourish in the NBA. It
won't iust he white players, though.

Fundamentally. sound players will
flourish. Basketball players will actu
ally be required to pass, move, make
wise derisions, and think on the spot.
Isn 't that amazing?
People want to see dunks,
however. Zone defenses dilute
athleticism.
I'lien so be it. Overathletu ism ami
the one-on-one, mano-a-mano men
tality is destroying the game. I'rosperts
practice more time perfecting their
double-pump windmills than they do
solid bourne passes, /'layers throw
more passes off of their elbows than
their chests. The zone may improve the
college game as well, forcing super
stars to stay in an extra year to perfect
their fundamentals.
But what about now? There

are so many teams who have
drafted the "best athlete avail
able." What will happen to the
league next vear when athletes
tr\ to learn how to be basketball
players? The N BA is going to be a
