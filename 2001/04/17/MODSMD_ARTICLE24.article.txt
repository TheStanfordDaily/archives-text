## Inside the zone inside my head 
### 
When ilu' NBA pub
licly ac knowledged
a couple of months
ago that they were
going to possibly eliminate the
ambiguous illegal defense viola
tion, many people, inc hiding my
self, did not know what to think.

l)id the pros
outweigh the
cons?
After the NBA
made /one de
fenses officialh
legal bv eliminat
ing the ever
changing illegal
defense rules last

week, I am still divided about
whether this will help save or de
stroy the N BA.
With every optimistic or pes
simistic thought. I can hear .1
rebuttal from niv imaginary
alter ego.
This will kill the NBA.
No, it won't.
Yes, it will, like Charles
Barklev said. "The\ |ust made the
world safe for c rappy plavers."
/ said, no! Abolishing illegal de
fenses will improve the NHA.
Zone defenses are going to
slow down the game even more.
It is like trying to increase stor
ing in hockey with the neutral
zone trap.
No, it\ not. Most NBA teams
will not consistently use the zone be
cause NBA players will destroy it.
With the new rule, there will be less
stagnant isolation (days and more
ball movement between all five
members of the team, a novel con
cept called teamwork.

It is still frightening to imag
ine an N BA schedule full ot tem
ple vs. Princeton wars of .(tui
tion. When the Heat battle the
Knit ks. will the score be in the
40s?
No, stupid. In college, games can
be more stagimnt because of the 35-
second shot clock. With a 24-second
shot dock, scoring might ei'en in
crease. Plus, anything is better than
today's "milking even second of the
shot-clock " style of {day.
In order to prevent four play
ers from spotting up and draw
ing the other defenders away
from the ball, the NBA is now
going to allow teams to double
and triple-team their marquee
players.
You are assuming that even team
will only (day zone, and that is non
sense. The best college teams don't
even /day zone all the time. Eliminat
ing illegal defenses will simply give
coaches more choices on defense.
Like that is what we needed:
|eft Van Guildv with more ( hon -
es on defense.
You don't understand!
No, 1 don't. This will dilute the
NBA stvle of plav. I'liese gim
mick defenses will eliminate ac -
robatic one-on-one moves. And
forget seeing Vince Garter and
Kobe Brvant drive the lane and
inventing acrobatic dunks. For
get Showtime.
Actually, coaches. who will also
have to earn their money by actually
coaching instead of calling iso, iso, iso
and iso, will realize that they will need
to beat the defense dtnvn the court be
