Ihese are the qualities a gymnast
must possess. They are also tliÂ«
characteristics of a great leader,
through her dedication to the
gymnastics team this year, sopho
more Alissa C.ooper has proven
that she is both a gymnast and a
leader.
A severe ankle sprain has kept
Cooper out of competition lor
most ot the season, but she is in the
g\m every day, doing as much as
the injur)' allows her to do.
"1 have been doing a lot ol bars
and strength work," she said. "1
reallv miss vault, though."
C.ooper said she is committed
to improving herself, and she
knows her teammates are count
ing on her to be at practice. After
.ill, they chose her to be co-cap
tain of the team. Though she is
only a sophomore, her leader
ship abilities are obvious to those
around her.
"Coop [as teammates t all her]
is actually the youngest one on the
team, but site's the one everyone
counts on to get things done be
cause she's reallv organized," said
junior co-captain Katv Herbert.
Cooper has always shown in
credible dedication. She began
taking gymnastics (lasses when
she was four. Kven at that age, she
worked extremely hard in the
gvm and was competing bv the
time she was eight.
lu high school near her home
in liethesda, Md., Cooper spent
most of her time .it the gvm and
devoted whatever time was left to
her school work. She has found
that the balance between acade

spend as much time at the gym,
her computer science major
keeps her busy.
"1 have to be really organized
with my time, but I've also real
ized that I can't always hold myself
to the same standards 1 had in
high school," C.ooper said. "Gym
nastics takes up a lot of time, so if 1
don't do as well in a class it's not
the end of the world."
Cooper knew that she wanted
to attend a school that would be
academically challenging, and she
narrowed the field down to Stan
ford and California. After visiting
both, she chose Stanford because
she preferred the coaches and the
team dynamic.
Once at Stanford, Cooper ad
justed easily to the team aspect of
c<dlege gymnastics.
"1 love the fact that you have
the whole team all pulling for the
same goal, and 1 like being able to
specialize in certain events be
cause 1 always hated doing beam,"
she said.
In her first year on the team,
Cooper competed on the vault in
every meet and was also a fre
quent competitor on bars. Her
focus and dedication earned bet
recognition as the most consistent
Stanford gymnast on the bars.
Although she has not been able
