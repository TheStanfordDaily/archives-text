Ihese are the qualities a gymnast
must possess. They are also tliÂ«
characteristics of a great leader,
through her dedication to the
gymnastics team this year, sopho
more Alissa C.ooper has proven
that she is both a gymnast and a
leader.
A severe ankle sprain has kept
Cooper out of competition lor
most ot the season, but she is in the
g\m every day, doing as much as
the injur)' allows her to do.
"1 have been doing a lot ol bars
and strength work," she said. "1
reallv miss vault, though."
C.ooper said she is committed
to improving herself, and she
knows her teammates are count
ing on her to be at practice. After
.ill, they chose her to be co-cap
tain of the team. Though she is
only a sophomore, her leader
ship abilities are obvious to those
around her.
"Coop [as teammates t all her]
is actually the youngest one on the
team, but site's the one everyone
counts on to get things done be
cause she's reallv organized," said
junior co-captain Katv Herbert.
Cooper has always shown in
credible dedication. She began
taking gymnastics (lasses when
she was four. Kven at that age, she
worked extremely hard in the
gvm and was competing bv the
time she was eight.
lu high school near her home
in liethesda, Md., Cooper spent
most of her time .it the gvm and
devoted whatever time was left to
her school work. She has found
that the balance between acade

mics and gymnastics has shitted at
Stanford. While she does not
spend as much time at the gym,
her computer science major
keeps her busy.
"1 have to be really organized
with my time, but I've also real
ized that I can't always hold myself
to the same standards 1 had in
high school," C.ooper said. "Gym
nastics takes up a lot of time, so if 1
don't do as well in a class it's not
the end of the world."
Cooper knew that she wanted
to attend a school that would be
academically challenging, and she
narrowed the field down to Stan
ford and California. After visiting
both, she chose Stanford because
she preferred the coaches and the
team dynamic.
Once at Stanford, Cooper ad
justed easily to the team aspect of
c<dlege gymnastics.
"1 love the fact that you have
the whole team all pulling for the
same goal, and 1 like being able to
specialize in certain events be
cause 1 always hated doing beam,"
she said.
In her first year on the team,
Cooper competed on the vault in
every meet and was also a fre
quent competitor on bars. Her
focus and dedication earned bet
recognition as the most consistent
Stanford gymnast on the bars.
Although she has not been able
to compete as much this season
because of her ankle injury, Coop
er has proven to be the consum
mate team player.
At meets, she sets the equip
ment for her teammates and
helps them prepare to compete.

nuu li tun and does not allow her to

"It seems like a small thing, hut
no one really wants to do floor
music. She just does it, and she
never complains. She is just really
positive .uid supportive of every
one else." Herbert said. "Coop is
just the kind of person who takes
tare of all the little things that peo
ple don't always notice but are so
important."
Her ankle is healing well, so
('.ooper hopes to return to the line
up next season. 1 lie vault is her
best event, one where her strength
and power allow her to perform
difficult skills.
"She's a very st r< >ng vaulter, and
she also has a really nice bar rou
tine," said Stanford head coach
Mark Cook. "As the recruits came
in this year, the team got a little
stronger and made it more com
petitive tor everybody. Coop has
been working really hard to up
grade the difficulty of her routine
so she can get back into the lineup
on bars."
Meeting the responsibilities of
captain has allowed ('ooper to con
tribute to the team and stay in
volved since she stopped compet
ing. Her teammates said they also
appreciate having her there to talk.
"She is always there for even

ing people's moods and empathiz
ing with how they're feeling," said
freshman Shelly Coldberg.

and knowledgeable. Cooper's
teammates use her as a resource

academics, particularly because
there are so many freshmen on the
team this year.
Cooper is a valuable liaison be
tween the gymnasts and the coach
es because of her communication
skills. She is a resource to the
coaches, keeping them aware of
what is going on with the team, and
she also helps her teammates ad
dress any issues they are having.
"She is someone that you can
trust, so people feel comfortable
going through her to approach the
coaches with something," Cold
berg said.
In addition to her ability to deal
with people, Cooper's work ethic
also stands out.
"(loop works so hard in the
gvm on a day-to-day basis. She
shows tremendous persever
ance," ('.ook said.
Her roommate and teammate
junior Becky Meld rum said she
sees that Cooper demonstrates the
same level of dedication in every
thing she does.
"She's a really hard worker,
which makes her a role model for
everyone on the team. She also
works really hard academically be

Mcldrum said.
