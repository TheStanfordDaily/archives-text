The sophomore high jumper cleared a career-best
height of 5 feet, 10 1/2 inches this weekend to take
top honors at the Brutus Hamilton Invitational in
Berkeley. The jump put Stone fourth on Stanford's
all-time high-jump rankings.

The 22-year-old sophomore transfer from BYU has
put together an outstanding premier season for the
Cardinal. He improved his record to 8-1 with a
1.64 ERA after throwing eight innings of one-hit
ball against Oregon State Thursday night.
