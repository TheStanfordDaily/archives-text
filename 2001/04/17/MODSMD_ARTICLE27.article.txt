# Seniors come out like roses
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
After four years competing on the Stanford (»olt
Course, nothing has changed for seniors Stephanie
Keever and Hilary Homeyer.
Except, each has a couple more roses.
The senior duo, which helped the Cardinal win the
Stanford / Pepsi Intercollegiate in their first event on
the same course as freshmen in 1997, led No. Stan
ford to a victory this weekend at the Peg Barnard Cal
ifornia Collegiate. Keever, ranked 12th in the nation.

placed second individualh after shooting rounds of
75-72 ( + while Homever tied for seventh after
rounds 0f74-76 (+6).
The event was the seniors' last on tin- long, woodsy
Stanford course that had plavcd host to countless
practice rounds throughout their last font years.
I lead coat h (Caroline ()'(ionnor pi efen etl to use the
term "bookends" to describe the two wins on the
course, which came toward the beginning and end of
Keever and I lomeyer's collegiate competitive cat eers.
I his tunc around, though, thev
weren't alone. 1 heir fathers, Larrv
keever and Bill Homeyer, made
the trek to Palo Alto together from
Las Vegas, New, to see their
daughters compete on the f>,200-
yard, par-72 course one last time.
1 he two fathers met their
daughters with a peach rose in
hand — a rose that not only held
sentiment.il value in each players'
heart. I>ut had a calming eftee t on
Homeyer throughout her final
round on Saturday.
Homever stuck the rose in her
golf hag and, later in the round,
after hitting a bad shot, she hap
pened to notice the bright petals
glimmering from the confines of
her bag. Ii was at that moment that
she took .i step back and calmed
herselfdown.
"I told myself, 'Let's just have
lun out here and keep plaving the
wav I know how." I loniever said.
It is that "lun" that has kept
Keever and Honiever coming
luck to the driving range almost
even da\ tin the past foui years.
Both expressed how much the\
have enjoved coming to practice
and being with all of their team
males. And, after the tournament,
when a spec i.il reremom was held
loi the senior goltei s, all the othei
memories flowed through theii
minds as well.
1 was s.id thinking about lum
all that is suddenh going to be
gone — all the extra stuff we do,"
I lomevei said.
(ioiug to bai s together, danc ing
with eac Ii otliet. ha\ll sleepovei s
and all "that random sttiH." ac
cording to the senior, will be what
she misses tlu- most.

"All of those things have been
good for team bonding, and it has
been great to have had sin ha
tight-knit group," Homever said.
Also recognizee! at the ceremo
ny were redshirt junior |essie.i Bel
skis, who entered her freshman
year with Keever and Honiever,
and senior Lauren Robertson,
who plaved on the team her first
three years at Stanford.
Keever also admitted that she
shed a few tears at the end of the
day, not to mention the nostal
gic feelings she c arried with her
on the course throughout bet
final round.
I he emotions did not get in the
wav ot Keever s performance,
however. I he second-place finish
(.line on the heels of her second in
dividual win of the season, which
shecaptureel last week at the PIX(.
AS I Invitational.
And. as tai as the team was con
c erneel, a win could not have < ome
at a bettei time. Stanford was the
onl\ top-live team not to have won
a tournament this year, and the
event ibis week was the last before
postseason pla\ starts next week.
"It's really big to have a first
place tropin because, when vou
win a tournament, you reallv re
alize that vou can do it again,"
Keevei said.
I lie ( arclmal would love to do
it again at the Pacific 10 ( hainpi
onships, which will be held in
1 ernpe, Ariz, next week I lie
squad will then shift its focus to the
\( A A West Kegionals in Ma\. ten
tativeh scheduled to be plaved in
()regon.
"We just have to st.i\ inn and
sta\ healtln." Keevei said. "The
next month is a lut; marathon, and
we all have to sta\ foe used.
Mavbe .ill ot the plavers might
want to stick a rose m their bags the
next couple ot weeks like I It >ine\

er did on Saturday. There should
be enough to go around. O'Con
nor and the rest of the team pre
sented Keevei and Honiever with
even more roses aftei theii rounds

on Saturday.
And, <>! ((tinst". tlit' colors were
appropriate, too.
I lie roses were .ill (lardiual red
.iikl white.
