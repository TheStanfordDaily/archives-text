matches down there, Martin
said. "Some guys rallied back
from tough performances a cou

the ultimate test for Stanford
right before the Pac-10 Individ
ual Tournament and the NCAA
Championship in Athens, Ca.

Stanford must first contend with
a vei v strong team in I'epperdinc

"[Tomorrow's] will be a tough
test," Morris said. "Somehow we
beat IVpperdine really badlv last
year, but we have a lot of respect
for this team."
Unlike other matches this

that Stanford ran afford to look
past. So far this year, I'eppercline
have beaten ranked teams like
Texas, Illinois, Baylor, Arizona
State and Fresno State.
"We all know that we play
three very good teams tins week,
so 1 don't think we need any
extra pep talk," he said. "1 think
everyone is ready and excited for
the last week of the regular sea
son."
I he match tomorrow will
begin an hour earlier at 112 p.m.,
not 5 p.m., as previously stated
on the schedule.
