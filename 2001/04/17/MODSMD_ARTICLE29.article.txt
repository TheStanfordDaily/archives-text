Stanford had some adjustments
to make on Saturday, seeing as
Dana k.liter, senioi tri-c.iptain
and defensiye leader, was out ol

eommission with au ankle injury,
and sophomore l.i/ Lancse, the
se( olid-highest s( oreron the team,
was out alter haying her wisdom

able to dig deep and put their

field m shutting down the l(-

"W edefiniteh missed I )ana and

enough depth and everyone con

Stanford pulled ahead c|iii< kl\
in Saturday's game, .is senior tri
captain Katharine Barnes, who
leads tlu* team with 111 goals this
season, tired in the first goal ol the
contest less than three minutes
into the matt h.

I lie second li.ill oi the game
lound both teams struggling to
find the back of the net, as Stan

lord adtled onlv one more goal to
its score, while UC-l)avis atldetl
just two.
Osterwise attributed the low
storing to the high number of
turnovers posted by both teams,
which resulted in a lot ot transition
plav .ind a lot ot running for the
midfielders.
"Both teams were turning the
ball over betore it could be settled,"
she s.iid. "In one sense, that sort of
play said gotxl things about our
mitlfieltl defense, but the l.u k of
teamwork in our settled offense
made us tired."
Uhltelder agreed, but added
that, besides being fatigued, Stan
ford also had a tough time eon
verting in front of the goal.
"We took 38 shots," she said.
"(u antcd we hit the poles a couple
of times .tnd that's just part of the
game, but we did have the ball a lot
of the game and we definitely got .1
lot of shots off. We were just tired,
and we rushed some."
()vei all, I hlfeldei said she felt
Saturday's game was a lesson tor
her team in learning to execute
sli.ll p|\ late 111 a fast-paced game.
"It was a hot day, and at some
points the game felt like a track
meet. I think the girls learned that
in that sort of game we can be a lot
smarter with the ball and oui pos
sessions 111 order to eliminate lll
ad\ ised shots and sillv turnovers."
Stanford will attempt to prac
ticc what it learned during tomor
row's I pan. match at St. Mary's.
In the teams' last meeting, Stan
ford narrowh defeated the Caels,
9-8. In tomorrow's game, the Car
dinal will attempt to slow down Si.
Mary's fast-breaking offense to
come up with .1 more convincing
victory.
"St. Mary's has a lot ot good
speed on their team; some kids
who .lie reallx at 11 let it and who
take the lull to the net. It will be
important for lis to stop the run
ner and slow the ball down,"
I hlfeldei said. "It's been a focus ot
out s all \ eai to play great team de
fense, and this won't be any more
ti lie than 111 tomorrow's game."
"We hope to have better control
ot the momentum 111 tomorrow's
game. We want to work 011 getting
up earlv and staving there — con
tinuing the push .ind not losing
112( x us, ()sterwise said.
