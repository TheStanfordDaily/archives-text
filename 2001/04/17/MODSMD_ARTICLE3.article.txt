alties, thev all possess, in their own
right, distinguishing characteris
tics," Wais said. " 1 hey have difler
ent histories, different si/es of com
munities to serve, and those differ
ences are reflected in then staffing
and differing budgets."
Half of the $50,000 f<>r eat h cen

and the other half will he in one
time funds guaranteed for three
years. Wais said that there will he a
push to replace .ill one-time funds
with permanent funds from the
University's budget within the next
three years.
Each community ( enter will be
responsible foi allocating its new
funding as needed, but Wais said
that the centers are not expected
to increase or expand program
ming through the additional
money.
"We're trying to stabilize things
so they can continue to do what
they're doing without staff or stu
dents feeling overwhelmed l>\ the
burden of tiindraising." he said.

" This new funding reflects the

University's continued commit
ment to cultivate an environment
that is not only intellectually c hal
lenging, but responsive to the rich
cultural and soeial diversity of its
students," said Fiance Morales, di
rector of El ( entro ('.hicano.
"The community centers have
always played an integral role in
the intellectual, cultural and sot ial
lives of Stanford students," Jan
Itarker-Alexander. director of the
Black ('.onimunitv Services (lenter,
said. "The commitment of this
money by [University President
|olin I lenncssv and Provost John
En hemendy] shows that thev sup
port and understand the role of
communitN tenters."
Winona Sinuns, director of the
American Indian, Alaska Native
and Native Hawaiian Program,
agreed.
"To have our work acknowl
edged and supported bv the |l ni
versitv] is not only encouraging, it
also serves as an incentive to work
ever more enthusiastically on
meeting student needs. I o have
permanent funding and program
mone\ makes our woi k more man
ageable, she said.
Students working at the com
munity centers are also excited
about the opportunities the fund
ing will afford.
"A lot |of the funding! will go

into our programming budget,"
said junior Rolando Longoria, a
program coordinator at tlu*
I.CBTCC. "We've broadened
our programming and resources
more to encompass support and
increased student interaction
and outreach.
"With more funding, we can
do things that are more support
oriented than we've had in the
past. We won't have to worry
about scrounging up money t<>
fund the programs," he said.
"Since we have extra funding, we
have more security and more
freedom in our programming.
The Concerned Students for
Community ( enters worked with
I nivcrsit\ administrators to bud
get the additional funds and
"[made] sure that the provost
heard our com erns loud and (lear
.iikl understood the strength of the
popular will behind improving

sumura, .1 membei ol the group.
"[Htchemendv] responded to
tis, as well .is to othei administra
tors who brought linn (lie same
concerns â€” largely because they
also saw students' proaetivitv as a
sign of the immediac \ of this need,
she said. "We were luck\ to have
administrators with open ears and
.1 commitment to diversity."
