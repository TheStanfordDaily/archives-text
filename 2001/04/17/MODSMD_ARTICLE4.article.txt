I lie Stanford Student Medical Interpreters
provide an essential service to patients at the
Stanford Hospital In helping non-English
speaking patients communicate with hospital
start members.
Responding to a general lack of funds tor
trained interpreting personnel, the dedicat
ed members of the group volunteer their time
for the hospital as translators.
SSMI. which has been operating since 1999,
was the brainchild of senior Ear/ad Aletni and
English and Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth Trau
gott. Alemi. then a student in Traugott's
Sophomore Dialogue "Doctor-Patient Com
munications" was a I read v involved with hospi

tal translation and was aware of the shortage of
trained interpreters available to the Stanford
Medical ('.enter.
With the help of I Yaugott, Alemi formed
.Stanford Student Medical Interpreters, which
started as a small group of Stanford students
and continues to grow in size every vear.
" 1 lie role of the interpreter fascinated me. I
thought I'd trv inv hand at interpreting, since 1
speak Earsi," Alemi said.
I he Medical (letiter, reach to expand its ex
isting "Language Hank program, which uti
lizes local multi-lingual c itizens to helpfac ilitate
patient-chxtor communicatioti, was enthusias
tic about helping the new organization.
"Originally, onlv members of [local ethnic
groups] were involved," I .anguage bank (.oor

dinator Monique Alfaro said. "However, now
we haw trained students from 1 1 it-1 University as
well. 1 his program helps students have a foot
in the door."
The Medical Center has been providing
ongoing training for new interpreters. I he
training helps students who, though conver
sationally competent, may not have a medic.il
vocabulary.
Interested students spend two days in ( lass
es learning medical terms in their respective
languages, followed bv 10 hours of shadowing
a doctor and practicing the terminology.
In addition, students benefit from the
shadowing experience by becoming more ac-
c ustomed to working in a hospital
setting.
"The hours oi''training by | Med
ical] School personnel are neces
sary lor a third party to respect the
sensitivities of the patients." 11 au
gott said. After the training ses
sions and practice, the student is
registered as an official volunteer
medical interpreter.
The progam maintains th.it vol
unteerism is an important service
th.tt also contributes positively to
the members' lives.
"It was a learning experience
for everybody involved." Alemi
said. "It improved all our language
skills and helped our tics with the
local communities."

Other members agreed that
tlicit communication and empa
thetic skills have been improved
through working at the hospital.
I he group entourages all stu
dents interested in improving
their spoken language and com
munication skills to become in
volved. Although nianv partici
pants are pre-medical students,
the service is not geared spec ifi
call\ toward those looking to join
the medical profession.
"Kvervboch is welcome." Alemi
said. "Mam ol the students are not
pre-med. We are < ertainlv open to
cvervbodv. provided that thev are
interested and committed [to in
terpreting]."
While students see mam as
pects ol hospital operations and
can learn about how a hospital
works, tins experience emphasizes
personal interactions with pa

flents .ind requires no previous
medical experience. All tli.it the
hospital asks lor is sensitivit\ to
ward tlu- patients, which is re
quired ol anyone working in the
medical field, ( an tenth , there is
still a need tor students who know
languages that are in high de

"Spanish demands are still very
high." Menu said. In addition, the
hospital is looking for intei prcters
who know other frequently-used
languages, sikh .is Mandarin.
