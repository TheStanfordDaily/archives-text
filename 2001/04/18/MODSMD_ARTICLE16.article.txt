# Foot-and-mouth outbreak in U.S.?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
The director of the only U.S. lab
that studies and tests tor foot
and-mouth disease said vester
day that the chances ot an out
break somewhere in the count r\
are "quite great." given the
amount people travel between
the U.S. and Britain.
"It's only through the dili
gence of the people .it the vari
ous ports ot entry that we've
been able to keep il out. I'll have
to add also link," said David
Huxsoll, director of the Agricul
ture Department's Plum Island
laboratory, off Long Island,
N.Y.
Foot-and-mouth disease is
harmless to humans but has
devastated livestock in Britain
because herds are destroyed to
prevent its spread. The disease
is common throughout most of
the world, including South
America, but has not been found
in the United States since 1929.
t SDA has banned imports of
livestock and raw meat from the
European Union and has in
creased inspections of incoming
airline passengers.
"We are doing everything we
can to make sure it doesn't come
into this country," Agriculture
Secretary Ann Veneman said at
an agricultural policy confer
ence yesterday.
More than lb million peo pie
arrive in the United States an
nually on flights from Britain.
About 2 percent have items that
could carry the virus, such as
meat and cheese, according to
an Agriculture Department sur

vey in 1999. A much smaller
number — 22 of the nearly
21,000 passengers surveyed —
visit ,i farm or rant h after arriv
ing here.
If the virus has readied the
I mted States already, it could
have been in the country for
only 24 to IN hours, Huxsoll
s.iid, speaking to reporters .it the
New York lab.
"Signs for the disease would
appeal quite quickly, and we
have veterinarians . . . that are
extrenich alert and sensitive to
the appearance to those kind of
lesions and it would get report
ed very quickly," he said.
Plum Island would be the
first to know of .in outbreak be
cause it tests tissue samples sent
in by veterinarians from suspect
cases.
US DA, meanwhile, lias asked
a variety of federal agencies, in
cluding the departments of De
fense and Interior, to lulp pre
pare for an outbreak of foot
and-inourh disease.
"We have adequate re
sources'" to keep the disease out
of the United States, "but we are
going to continue to look at the
systems that are in place." I SDA
spokesman Kevin I lerglotz said.
Representatives of various
departments and agencies,
which also included the Federal
Kinerge n c v Manage tn en t
Agency, conducted a tabletop
exercise last week to test their
ability to respond to a worst-case
scenario in which the disease
broke out in lowa and spread to
three other states.
