1 his quarter, Bee lit el Interna
tional ('enter offers a series of
meetings on how Stanford stu
dents can applv for several presti
gious international stuel\ awards,
including the Rhodes, Marshall
and Fulbright scholarships.
1 he Rhodes and Mat.shall
awards are designed t<>i students
w ho wish to pursue gi aduate level
studies in the United kingdom.
I he Fulbright allows graduate
level study in any of Over 90 coun
tries around the world. Although
applications deadlines for these
and other awards are still months
away, John Pearson, direc tor of
Bechtel International Center,
urges students to start thinking
earl) about the application
process. While students at
schools that run on the semes
ter system often have a month
of class before deadlines ap
proach, Stanford students
face greater time constraints.
"National deadlines are ex
treineh early. .Mudehts can't wait
till the\ come back fall quarter he
cause the deadlines are within
four to five davs of the start of
(lasses." IV.n son s.iid.
Students interested in apply
ing for such scholarships should
start considering the process
earlv. I he meetings this quarter
ai e designed to i aise awareness < >1
these awards. In addition, pre-ap
pli<.iiion lot ins .ii c a\ailable
through the Oveiseas Resource
Center's Web site
(hup: www.stanford.edu dept ic
enter ore ).
After students express interest
in a particulat scholarship, tliev
meet personallv with Peai son to
talk about the application. Pear
son encourages .mv interested
students to speak with him.
"\\ e trv to clo as tunc h out
reach as we can. I've been meet
ing individually with students
since January. [Fvenj sopho
mores can come talk to me. I
would explain w hat resources are
available at the International
Center. Don't feel sliv about e
niail or coming in at am time."

Pearson said.
\\ innei s of these awards agree
with Pearson that the deadlines
tome <|tii( kl\ and the application
process is time consuming, in
volving essays, recommenda
tions, interviews and.in the case
of the Fulbright, a sponsor in the
countrx where the applicant
wishes to studv.
" I he process was prettv time
consuming tor about () to 8
weeks. The most important thing
was getting a contact in Australia
who would sponsor mv propos
al. s.iul Katie Bryan-Jones, ('.lass
ot 1997, who was awarded a Ful
bright to study fora masters ot
public health In research at the
I uiversitN of New South Wales
in 2002.
I lie applicants tor most of
these sc holai ships are graduating
seniors 01 graduate students.
Vlan\ students decide to hold off
on appl\ ing tor scholarships until
the tall at'tei their senior vear,
since the application process is
rigorous and it is hard to find time
with a hectic senior schedule.
Some, like Bryan-Jones, take
even more time off before applv
ing fora scholarship.
I lie most important part of the
application tor tlu- various schol
arships is having .1 c lear idea ot
the area of research or stuck. "Be
prepared to spend time researc li
ing what you want to do. The
more detailed vour proposal and
the moree\idenceot support \<>u
have, the more likeh \ou will get
it." Bin.lll-Jones said.
A detailed study plan is neccs
sar\ before a student begins to till
out .tpplic ations.
"I lave a firm studv plan 111
mind —an institution, topic and
concise niethodologv — well in
advance <>112 applying. These mav
( hange, of course, but a convinc -
ing statement of purpose is kev,"
said (In istopher Scott, a doctotal
candidate and Fulbright Scholar
to Japan.
According to Pearson, al
though each scholarship varies 111
its exact requirements, there arc
three criteria that everv applicant
must meet. "Scholarships are sim
ilar in what thc\ look for: a strong
academic record, strong refer
ences, and a confident assertion
that von know exaeth what von
want to do overseas," he said.
Margot Kane toft Uranelen
bnrg, .t Fulbright Scholar fen
2002, has had priot overseas ex
perience through the National
Sectirih l-.dncation I'rogram foi
nuclei graduate students. She
said she found the experience
wort li while.
"1 learned so nine h that it is
simph not possible to learn here
at Stanford. I he experience was
incredible from a personal and
an academic perspective," she
said.
Stanford has an impressive
success rate for l-'ulbright awards;
this vear, of 51 applications
made it past national screenings,
and seven or eight winners have
alreach been announced. Howev
er, the numbers ol Rhodes and
Marshall awards tor Stanford stu
dents have fallen sliai pl\.
IVarson speculates that the elc
c line in Rhodes and M.n shall ap

plit .nils .it Stanford mav be a te
suit of ,i greater interest in more
into national stud\.
Rhodes and Marshall
awards are limited to the
I nited Kingdom.
I here has also been a de< line
in awards to I lar\ aid, \ ale,
Princeton and (leorgetown
schools that traclitionallv. along
with Stanford, liad the greatest
niunbei ot recipients. I Ins. Pear
son thinks. ma\ be the result of a
"flattening out of awards" among
Atnei it an schools.
Pearson emphasizes that the
Rhodes, Marshall and I'ulbriglit
are for am area of stitch .
"I lunianities and sex i.il sc ietue
students nia\ appl\ more, but all
these awards are subject-blind,
and anvbeuh is eligible to apph."
Pearson said.
Senioi Dat lie k ( hang is a I ul
bright recipient who will be con
ducting pin sits research next
vear.it the I niversitvof l urku in
Finland. " I he reason I applied
lor the l ulbright program, and
the reason I think it would be a
great opportunitv tor anvoue in
tetested in stnd\ oi research
abroad, is that the program is
open to people in almost am field
science, humanities |and| the
arts." ('.hang said.
