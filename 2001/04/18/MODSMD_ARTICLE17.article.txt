1 he Rhodes and Mat.shall

I he Fulbright allows graduate

applications deadlines for these
and other awards are still months
away, John Pearson, direc tor of
Bechtel International Center,
urges students to start thinking

process. While students at
schools that run on the semes
ter system often have a month
of class before deadlines ap
proach, Stanford students
face greater time constraints.
"National deadlines are ex
treineh early. .Mudehts can't wait
till the\ come back fall quarter he
cause the deadlines are within

process is time consuming, in
volving essays, recommenda

of the Fulbright, a sponsor in the
countrx where the applicant
wishes to studv.
