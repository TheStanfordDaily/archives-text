LIKK I I IK LAS 1 dangling dregs of
fang swirling in the bottom of the con
tainer, groups of females and males an
nually jump through the rushing
rapids in hope of reai hing the placid streams of
inclusion where Ircsh friendships and part\
plans for the next three years are spawned;
where esurient bears gather to snatch up the es
culent few in their paws and welcome them into
their club; where (-reek letters are handed out
with all the tradition and honor included in
their ahistorical pairings; w here happiness and
rejection are delicateh balanced on the
precipice of a paper bid. for main freshmen,
the Rush process slow s regular campus life lor
four intense days for women and for two weeks
for men while the prospects primp, crimp and
tuck their way into the hearts of each group. Hut
is the intensitN realh necessary?
Women's Rush takes plate oyer a grueling
fbur-da\ period during which the women are cy-

cled through party after party where they anx
iously watch prepared presentations, listen to
the \irtues and graces of each respective organi
zation, and chitchat oyer sodas and cheese. Kach
successiye day brings another round of Iribal
Council cuts until the final day when the fortu
itous few are handed the holy grail of Rush: a bid.
But how unit li can one learn about a person —
beyond the superficial — at these events?
I lowevcr, the four short daws of female Rush
isn't the fault of the sororities. A governing body
— the Intersororih Council, and a similat Inter
fraternitN ('.ounc il for male Rush — dictates the
length of the respective Rushes, what is allowed
during the predetermined periods and w hat can
occur at the events. Rush is fraught with prob
lems for men and women alike, but the truncat
ed period of female Rush makes the process as
difficult as pumping blood through Dick Ch
ene\ 's arteries.
I lie period undoubtedh leaves all partici

pants physically and emotionally wi/ened. So
win not extend the process to a period of two
weeks like male Rush? This wav, more events
could be planned and more time could be bud
geted for substantive time where the active
members could engage and interact with the
rushees without worn over keeping the assem
bly line shuffling on schedule.
While male Rush is not perfect, the more ca
sual attitude with which the events are staged
and conducted seems to leave participants much
less harried and cracking under the pressure.
()bviouslv, worries about which group l>est suits
them plague males as well as females, but the
male process appears less tr\ ing and exhausting
for the participants. I he carefully monitored co
mmute parties and machine-gun conversations
tli.it dominate female Rush contrasts with chill
barlx'cues and relaxed cigar nights for guys.
()bviouslv, Stanford Rush is much better than
the debutante halls held at some universities.

lhe ultra-competitive atmosphere exaggerates
rejection, stubhornh at tat hing itself to a person
like a had case of athlete's loot. I his is not the case
at Stanford, where someone can rebound from a
(■reek loss because the Stanford social scene is
not dependent on the (-reck system.
Spring time is market! In blooming (lowers
and rain drifting awav to a mere memory and
freshmen legging out the final turn <>l Introduc
tion to the Humanities and friends growing
jumpy with worn'over who is going to room with
whom and w here to live. Ihe ISCI should look
into wavs to lessen the pressure antl worry sur
rounding this ali-important dec ision. Four days
to make a decision that could possibly decide
where and who you will live with is absurd.
Alter sweating and gabbing their wav through
the grueling inununit\ challenges, rushees
should enjo\ the Rush process antl remember
that, even though the Iribe max have spoken,
life still continues and a transfer isn't in order.
