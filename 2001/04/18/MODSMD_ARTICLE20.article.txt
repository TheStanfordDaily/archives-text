It a (I.ins existed .u Stanford with the
potential to make ns better people,
would we seek it out? 1! the professor
(lest rilx'd this t lass as "the creation
and (list oven ol what it means to he
human, would we enroll?
(lhantes are we'd be intrigued. We might
taki nit we had the time, lit it. as overextend
ed Stanford students with full st hedules and
hus\ extracurricular lives, most ol us would
probably pass on lhet»pp< >rt unity. Sadl\. it the
t lass's time conflicted with our "essential" Bio
i ore requirements or "killer" engineering se-

quencc, we wouldn't give it
.1 second thought.
I low ever, it there exist
ed a class at Stanford that
met twice a week, had no
exams or papers, was
based entirely on atten
dance .uitl participation
.iiid awarded us with
tour units of lettcr-gi ad-

I'd credit, would \vc be interested?
We'd probabb sleep out tonight to sign
up lor next year's c lass.
What il a single (lass contained all of the
above? I ben it would be called Drama ll.'t:
"(iroup (Communication.'' otherwise (and
allec tionateK) known as (it oup (0111111.
Herein lies the problem: Because of its
line conventional tonn.it, (iroup ( oiiini has
acquired s i reputation based niainh on Us
unic|iie recjuircments and grading proce
dure, rather than its merits or subject ni.it
tei Hioseth.it have not taken thee lass seem
to write it of! simple because it's different.
Without tests and papers and problem sets
to gauge one's progress, doubters question,
what could possibly be learned?
I was one of those doubters at the begin
ning of winter quarter. I joined the class
having heard little else but rumors about
bow we would be evaluated. Show up cverv
dav, contribute niv thoughts once in a while
and a gocxl grade would Ik- mine —it
sounded too good to be true. Anything 1
learned along the wav would be u mgon niv
(iroup (lorn in cake.
But, on the first da\ of class, 1 "met eves"
with our instructor, a ritual that would open
every session. Immediately, I knew mv ex
pectations tor the quarter were worthless.
