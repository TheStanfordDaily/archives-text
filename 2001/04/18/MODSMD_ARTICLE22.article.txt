Admit Weekend to 'showcase' Stanfor d
When reading Daniel I Isia'scolumn ("It's
time lot white riblxms") in vcsterda\ s D.iilv.
I developed s< >tneccntcerns regarding the It >1-
lowing statement: "While out purpose |< tin -
ing Admit Weekend] is not todisc outage the
admits to enroll .it Stanford, we feel it onK tail
that thc\ lx- informed of Stanford's short
comings .is well as its glories."
As a student tout guide. Admit Week
end coordinator and this vear's head ori
entation coordinator. I consider m\sell an
ambassador for Stanford. Regardless of
niv personal experiences as .1 student
here. 1 feel the most important thing anv
of us tan offer a prospective student dur
ing Admit Weekend is our honcstv. I am
ver\ aware of the highlv offensive and dis
turbing events that the Stanford commu
nit\ has been dealing with latch, but 1
would like to remind students of Admit
Weekend's mission and what to discuss
with prospective freshmen regarding stu
dent life at Stanford.
First, on behalf of the entire stall in charge
of Admit Weekend 2001 and the 2300 esti
mated parents and students that will lx- visit
ing oui campus. I 'd like to express our heart
felt thanks to the Stanford communitv.
Without our amazing student Ixxlv, faculty
and staff, we would have very little to show
case this weekend, and we appreciate all of
your efforts in ensuring things run smoothly
this weekend.
Second, please remember the mission of
Admit Weekend; it is not, as some think, to
raise Stanford's yield of admits. The role of
Admit Weekend is to showcase Stanford's te

sourccs in even as|xrt in order to allow ad
initted students the cli.incc to thoughtfullx
weigh their c hoices and decide where to in.i
triculate. The List tiling that 1 would c\|xvt
.ii i\ Stanford student to do is lx* dishonest to a
prosjxt tive freshman, oi inacc urateh repre
sent what student life is like hereon the Fai in.

felt during your a>llege decision and what it is

In reference to the hate crimes that have
t.ikcn place in recent weeks, remetnlxT that
this is the exception at Stanford, not the rule.

Islam is an ideology
I would like to thank Hie Duilvtbritsun

erageof the i .u ism i.ilk in the April 13 front
page article ("I'rof speaks on Islam, con
demns capitalism"). However. I feel the
need to address a comment made bv
Jenitjiie Meekins, a member ol the audience
at the talk.
1 11 his attempt to address the problem of
racism, l)r. Jalil Abdnl-Adil made it very
cleat that he was not preaching for conver
sion to Islam. Rather, he stressed that the
lei tine was intended to be, .is 1 lie Daily re
poitcrcorrect 1\ iaptnred it."aspringboard
to an ongoing disc ussion to see which sys
tem is best."
Perhaps the underlying confusion stems
from the secnlai conception of religion as
something personal. H\ contrast. Islam is a
wa\ of life and deals with main things that fall
outside the western concept of "religion." It
encompasses guidelines and teachings for all
facets of life and scx iety. As snc h. there is an
Islamic |k i s|h > c live on economics that is dif
ferent from c urrenth held notions of capital
ism. Presenting these pers|>ecti\es as an al
ternative to the current system is not neces
sarih a mandate toconvetl or to abandon all
other lx'liefs.
IU no means do I contest Meekins's
and others' right to view the call to replace
capitalism with Islam as problematic. 1
truly believe, however, that only through
healtln positive discussion can we aspire
to reach the best decisions to address
today's problems. After all. Stanford is the
ideal place for the exchange and critique
of ideas.

Admit Weekend to 'showcase' Stanfor d
When reading Daniel I Isia'scolumn ("It's
time lot white riblxms") in vcsterda\ s D.iilv.
I developed s< >tneccntcerns regarding the It >1-
lowing statement: "While out purpose |< tin -
ing Admit Weekend] is not todisc outage the
admits to enroll .it Stanford, we feel it onK tail
that thc\ lx- informed of Stanford's short
comings .is well as its glories."
As a student tout guide. Admit Week
end coordinator and this vear's head ori
entation coordinator. I consider m\sell an
ambassador for Stanford. Regardless of
niv personal experiences as .1 student
here. 1 feel the most important thing anv
of us tan offer a prospective student dur
ing Admit Weekend is our honcstv. I am
ver\ aware of the highlv offensive and dis
turbing events that the Stanford commu
nit\ has been dealing with latch, but 1
would like to remind students of Admit
Weekend's mission and what to discuss
with prospective freshmen regarding stu
dent life at Stanford.
First, on behalf of the entire stall in charge
of Admit Weekend 2001 and the 2300 esti
mated parents and students that will lx- visit
ing oui campus. I 'd like to express our heart
felt thanks to the Stanford communitv.
Without our amazing student Ixxlv, faculty
and staff, we would have very little to show
case this weekend, and we appreciate all of
your efforts in ensuring things run smoothly
this weekend.
Second, please remember the mission of
Admit Weekend; it is not, as some think, to
raise Stanford's yield of admits. The role of
Admit Weekend is to showcase Stanford's te

sourccs in even as|xrt in order to allow ad
initted students the cli.incc to thoughtfullx
weigh their c hoices and decide where to in.i
triculate. The List tiling that 1 would c\|xvt
.ii i\ Stanford student to do is lx* dishonest to a
prosjxt tive freshman, oi inacc urateh repre
sent what student life is like hereon the Fai in.
11i.it said, when discussing what nis like to at
tend Stanford with a puis|xtlivc student, please
tvnietnlxi the\ liavc aliout two wevks left to
makewh.it willlikeh lx-theme>st im|x>rtant de
cision in their lives to date. Remembei how vou
felt during your a>llege decision and what it is
like to lx* part of the St.u if« >rd c < >mmunit\.
In reference to the hate crimes that have
t.ikcn place in recent weeks, remetnlxT that
this is the exception at Stanford, not the rule.
I he I ni\ct sit\ gcx'S to great lengths to pro
tect its students and to investigate deepK the
source of all student conc ei its, noniattei how
small. Perhaps Admit We e kend will give us
each the c Ii ance to reflect on that and to ap
plaud oui administrator for then proactive
approach to assuaging students' feat s.
Fnjov this weekend and relive your own
decision prcxess through the prospective
students vou meet. The\ onl\ have three
days to spend at Stanford, but. hopefulh,
after talking to you and hearing an accurate
representation of our school, thev w ill end
up spending tour more years here.

Islam is an ideology
I would like to thank Hie Duilvtbritsun

erageof the i .u ism i.ilk in the April 13 front
page article ("I'rof speaks on Islam, con
demns capitalism"). However. I feel the
need to address a comment made bv
Jenitjiie Meekins, a member ol the audience
at the talk.
1 11 his attempt to address the problem of
racism, l)r. Jalil Abdnl-Adil made it very
cleat that he was not preaching for conver
sion to Islam. Rather, he stressed that the
lei tine was intended to be, .is 1 lie Daily re
poitcrcorrect 1\ iaptnred it."aspringboard
to an ongoing disc ussion to see which sys
tem is best."
Perhaps the underlying confusion stems
from the secnlai conception of religion as
something personal. H\ contrast. Islam is a
wa\ of life and deals with main things that fall
outside the western concept of "religion." It
encompasses guidelines and teachings for all
facets of life and scx iety. As snc h. there is an
Islamic |k i s|h > c live on economics that is dif
ferent from c urrenth held notions of capital
ism. Presenting these pers|>ecti\es as an al
ternative to the current system is not neces
sarih a mandate toconvetl or to abandon all
other lx'liefs.
IU no means do I contest Meekins's
and others' right to view the call to replace
