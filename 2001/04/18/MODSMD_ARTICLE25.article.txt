### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
Over the 1;»>i 20 years, Stanford has
Iniilt quite the- volleyball program foi it
self. on both the men's and the women's
sides.
For the last 11 veais, Ruben Nieves
has been.it the helm of the men's pro
gram .it Stanford, and. during Ins
tenure, the Cardinal has established it
self .is a perennial contendei foi the
\( AA ( hampionship.
I nder Nieves, Stanford has picked
up three conference titles, made two
NC.AA Championship appearances
and, in 1997, won the Cardinal's first
men's volleyball National Champi
onship. But even though Nieves li.is .i
knack for winning, the soft-spoken
«o.u h sees a lot more than raising( hain
pionship banners as Ins function at this
university.
"I don't see mvselt .isa ( hanipionship
pursuer .is much .is 1 set.- mwlt .is an
educator, like the professors at this uni
vei sitv. Nieves said. " 1 see teat hingand
guiding and serv ing as a role model as
inv primar\ hint tious. and I \alue those
things more and more as time goes on
Nieves fulfills these functions
through several different venues, \side
from his duties with the men's volleyball
team. Nieves also te.u lu's several volley
ball (lasses foi a wide range of skill lev
els throughout the year in the Depart
ment of Athletics, lie also inns clinics
for children and adults during the

stnooivcai aiuiovei me summer.
11 there is a lesson that Nieves stress
es the most to eveiNone he te.u lies, it is
that there is a c Icar distinction between
n\ iin ling and being su< cessful.
"I've coached long enough and lost
enough to know that noii have to ap
preciate even win. but winning is not
the same .is being successful." NieNes
said. "In inv definition of sun ess. win
ning alone is not enough. It's how you
about winning. It's ohln success
when vou bring the Nvhole package of
sportsmanship, leadership, represent
ing the I niversitN well and giving it
Nour best."
I he result of this lesson is visible al
niosi I'N'ei'N time his C ardinal squad

Rareh will one see a half-hearted
performance from someone in a Stan
ford uniform, and just about the onh
time \(>n will (ati h Nieves showing am
signs of frustration on the hem h is when
he suspei is that one of Ins plavers is not
ti v ing to do Ins best, regardless of how
will he is plaN ing.
|nsi In talking to am of Nievcs's
plavers about tlieii coach, there is no
doubt that he has re.u bed them with his
message.
"It's a lot of fun p 1 aniiig foi Ruben,
and vou delinitelv learn a lot about the
gatne." said sophomore Bilh Strick
land. "You re.illv get the sense that lie's
not just Irving to make vou a better vol
leyball plaver. but also a better person
through volleyball."
(M t nurse, Nieves is also vcrv good at
making people bettei volleyball plavers.
Not onlv have his plavers found suc
cess .it the collegiate level, but mam
have also gone on to plav with the 1 .S.
National I cam. I'wo of Nieves's forinei
players. Mike Lambert and \iuln Witt,

"Willi all Ins experience in competi
tion. von know that he knows what he's
talking about, said freshman |onathan
\ndci son. Ile II s.in . 'lie here, and the
ball will be there.' and you do it and the
ball is there. You can really learn the
game from him."
Nieves's coaching success has led
I S \ Vollevball to name him the head
coach for the I S. men's team at this
summers World I niversitN Games in
Beijing. 1 he World I niversitN Games,
n\hit hou in evei n other year, brings to
getlu i the world's best collegiate ath
letes in a number of sports, including
volleyball, basketball and soccer.
Mthough Nieves has had several as
sistant coaching and advising roles with
various I S. National learns over the
past 1 I v ears, this n\ ill be his first time as
a head c chlc h at this level of competition.
"This a step up in many ways,"
Nieves said of his upcoming coaching
job. "It's a great feeling to wear Stanford
on v oiu bai k into a gv in. but what a feel
ing to weai I S.A. on your back. It's a
great (liance to see w hat s being done at
the next level, nationalh and interna
tionalh. Most of the plavers will play on
the national team at some point, and
mam alreadv have some experience at
that level."
Nieves c redits much of his success to
the other coaches he has worked with
along the wav at Stanford, especially his
< urrcnt assistants, |ohn kostv and Al
Roderigues.

the- Stanford men's team since Nieves
took onei as head coach in 1991, and
