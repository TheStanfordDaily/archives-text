I lie reliable 22nd-ranked senior duo of All Ansari
and S( < »ii\ S< on (22-7) provided the other doubles win
.11 the third spot In beating Al (iarland and Racioppi,
S-4.
M.iilin and fellow sophomore Scott Lipsky (28-H),
ranked third in the nation, lost their first match as a
pair in dual mau lies of the season, against the Wave's
\o. 2 doubles team of I lansen and Rvan Redondo.
I he Cardinal actually pulled ahead at 2-0 with a
<|UK k singles win from Ansari (24-5) .it No. 6 singles, 6-
2,6-2, over Redondo.
I lus is where things started to become interesting.
In i matchup between two top-20 singles players,
second-ranked Kim (21-2) and I Ith-ranked Garland
gave the c rowd .i great show of how the top collegiate
playei sin the nation pl.i\.
With both players possessing strong grounds! rokes,
ii wasadispla\ of consistencv, almost impossible place
ment and intelligent pla\.
However, in a much ( loser match than reported,
Kim finally pulled out the vic tory in a highly charged
match, (>-1. (>—l. Ibis pulled the Cardinal within one
m.iidi of the vie ton .it:<-(). Unfortunately, things
began to look bleak for Stanford.
At No. singles. Scott (18-6) simply could not get
back into the match against his opponent, Cierold
Wiring, aftei .i 7-0 first-set heattbreaket. Wiring won
the mate h, 7-0, 6-;{, to pull IVpperdine to !*-1.
Ibis set the stage for three nerve-wracking 3-set
in.iic lies, including Martin's and Haviland's.
I lippensteel's match with the 43rd-ranked Suter
was the other match that went the distance at No. 2 sin
gles. In.i matchup of two powerful left\ serves. Hip
pensteel could not overtake Suter. who prevailed 6-4
1-6, 6-4.
Sulc is victory, which pulled the Wave to2-H, set the
stage for the dramatic finish.
'11 was a goe x 1 win because N(A Vs are so close. and
it would have been ,i downer to lose a mate h.it the end
of the season, Martin said." I his is big because of the
momentum it gives us going into the NCAAs."
I he match itself was a great match because it
was closer than a lot of other matches we have had
ibis \ear. he said. "\\ e haven't had a real tough bat
tling match in a while this year, so this was a real
good match for us. We had a lot of guvs pull
through for us."
