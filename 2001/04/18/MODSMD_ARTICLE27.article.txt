# Zone defense threatens NBA game

### 
A II overt Ins great land, washed up
shooting guards with bad knees
and above-average jump shots
are rejoit ing. Stunewhere in this
world, 7-liH)t-7 centers M.inute B«»l and

bet ause he can now put otl retirement l»>i
four or li\e more seasons.
Win all this commotion \ou ask.' I he
NBA retenth submitted its list ol rule
thanges lor next season, and foremost
a tilt >ng the changes was the elimination t »112
the illegal defense 1 ule. (>1 perhaps more
apprt>priaieh staled, the re-introduction
ol the /one defense to the N B \ altei a 10-
\e.u hiatus.
Bringing bat k the /one defense to the
N B A is tme ol lhe wt »rst j >t )ssible moves Ihe
league could have made. 111 an era in
whit h N BAexet utives have been tr\ mg to
alter niles to bring higher scoring and
more excitement into the league, this 1 ule
t lunge makes about as niut h seiist- as an
electoral svstem that .illows a bunt h ol

1 cannot fathom what the rules 10111-
mitlee was thinking when the\ .illowetl
this .ibonunation to tKCin. Perhaps the\
were thinking that fans were getting tired
t>f Vince (.alter s incredible one-on-one

tlrives to the basket, fin
ished with spet tat ulai
MO-degrce slams, and
that the people would be

the half-court set was

pelting a little old in the minds oi then >111-
niitlec. .md the\ lelt that the NBA would
be cnergi/cd In the sight of Rit k Fox tak
ing semi-o|H*n junipers from the xving,
while Sh.u) and Kohe endure constant
d<>uhle teams without getting the ball.
Whatevei their reasoning behind
bringing bat k the /one (I've heard minors
th.it a lot of alcohol provided In former
(lexcland sharpshootei Mark Trite max
have had some effect on the det ision), the
outcoinewill undoubtcdlx t hangcthc fat e
<»t the game tor the worse. Waving a /one
allows teams to hide the plavers th.it are
delensixc liabilities on the court. In a /one,
silt h players t an continuouslx get beaten
like a San Diego Chargers torncrback
without seriously impairing the team s
ahilitv to plax defense. In essence, the
NBA just took axvax the requirement that
xoii must Ik 1 a good athlete to plax basket
ball.

S<>. it \ou happen to he walking
through Dallas and you ser.i 7-C» Mormon
with a grin from eat to ear. that's bet ause
Shawn Uradlev's st<k k just went way up
now that he nolongei has to even pretend
to have the abiliix to guard someone on
the perimeter. Antl now that permanent!)
affixing oneself to a defensive position in
the low pt>sl is legal, tnavlx' the an«k it\
that was tlie multimillion dollar contract
that the Sonus gave Jim Mcllvaine (this
guv averaged four points per game w hen
the\ signed him) for 110 discernible reason,
other than for bring tall and taking up
space, w ill bet ome the rule 1 at her than the
exception. Happy birthday, Manute antl
(Jeorghe.
And it's n<>t tilth the fieakishh tall who
are excited about the rule change. 1 x*t 's
not fin get about all of the has-been guards
m this league who couldn't pla\ defense
.igainst a blind midget with a hook fora
hand but still have shooting range out to
'JO feet. Suddenly, the market tor these
guvs is expanding. So don't be sm prised it
you see Craig Klilo and |eff Hornacek
make startling returns to the NBA next
season, now that their defensive responsi
bilities arc limited to not falling down.
I lie /one defense rule is to the NIV\

Blowouts arc boring.
<>) I'he ( Uppers, (Iri/./lies,

will solve the dilution of talent in
the league In <|iiic kl\ eliminating
three teams (that is, if von actual--

basketball team).
I. foi one, am not looking for
ward to next season in the NBA. If
I wanted to watch a bunch of low
talent has-beens pretend like they
belong in professional sports, 1
would watc li the XFF. It will take a
miracle for next season to match
the ex( itcmcnt and drama that this
season has provided thus far. I'm
holding out fin Bill Ixiimbeer.
