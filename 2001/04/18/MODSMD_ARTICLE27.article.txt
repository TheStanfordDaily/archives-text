# Zone defense threatens NBA game

A II overt Ins great land, washed up
shooting guards with bad knees
and above-average jump shots

Win all this commotion \ou ask.' I he
NBA retenth submitted its list ol rule

a tilt >ng the changes was the elimination t »112
the illegal defense 1 ule. (>1 perhaps more

ol the /one defense to the N B \ altei a 10-

Bringing bat k the /one defense to the
N B A is tme ol lhe wt »rst j >t )ssible moves Ihe
league could have made. 111 an era in

more excitement into the league, this 1 ule

1 cannot fathom what the rules 10111-

while Sh.u) and Kohe endure constant
d<>uhle teams without getting the ball.
Whatevei their reasoning behind
bringing bat k the /one (I've heard minors
th.it a lot of alcohol provided In former
(lexcland sharpshootei Mark Trite max
have had some effect on the det ision), the
outcoinewill undoubtcdlx t hangcthc fat e
<»t the game tor the worse. Waving a /one
allows teams to hide the plavers th.it are
delensixc liabilities on the court. In a /one,
silt h players t an continuouslx get beaten
like a San Diego Chargers torncrback
without seriously impairing the team s
ahilitv to plax defense. In essence, the
NBA just took axvax the requirement that
xoii must Ik 1 a good athlete to plax basket
ball.

S<>. it \ou happen to he walking
through Dallas and you ser.i 7-C» Mormon
with a grin from eat to ear. that's bet ause
Shawn Uradlev's st<k k just went way up
now that he nolongei has to even pretend
to have the abiliix to guard someone on
the perimeter. Antl now that permanent!)
affixing oneself to a defensive position in
the low pt>sl is legal, tnavlx' the an«k it\
that was tlie multimillion dollar contract
that the Sonus gave Jim Mcllvaine (this
guv averaged four points per game w hen
the\ signed him) for 110 discernible reason,
other than for bring tall and taking up
space, w ill bet ome the rule 1 at her than the
exception. Happy birthday, Manute antl
(Jeorghe.
And it's n<>t tilth the fieakishh tall who
are excited about the rule change. 1 x*t 's
not fin get about all of the has-been guards
m this league who couldn't pla\ defense
.igainst a blind midget with a hook fora
hand but still have shooting range out to
'JO feet. Suddenly, the market tor these
guvs is expanding. So don't be sm prised it
you see Craig Klilo and |eff Hornacek
make startling returns to the NBA next
season, now that their defensive responsi
bilities arc limited to not falling down.
I lie /one defense rule is to the NIV\
