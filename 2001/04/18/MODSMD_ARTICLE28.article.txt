Goalkeeper Gavin Su and the Stanford men s lacrosse team hope to cap their successful regular
season with a win over rival California on Saturday to seal a USUA National Championship bid.

spectively. in save percentage in
the W'CLL. Joe's brother. Matt
Kennedy, and junior twins Paul
and lim Sargen comprise the
rest of the strong defensive unit.
Starting two sets of twins has
helped the defense to gel into a
cohesive unit that is capable of
shutting down .in opponent's en
tire game plan.
Although defense i> definitely
the.strong point of this year's
squad, the attack is not too shab
by either. Senior Brvan Dnna
gan leads the team m scoring by
averaging I.3f> points per game,
while freshman standout Kid

points per game. The steady bal
ance between offense and de
fense lias been kev for the young
Cardinal team in establishing it
self as a legitimate contender for
the \V(ILL crown this season.
Stanford won its first four
league games of the season and
sat tied for first place with Sono
ma State before the April 7 show
down between the league leaders.
On that day, the Cossacks
handed the Cardinal its first
league loss of tin season by a l.'i
-8 score. In the eves of many
Stanford players, this was the
team's only legitimate league
loss of the season because of the
controversy that followed the
next week during the annual
battle with rival, and defending
league champion, ('.a I.
1 lie Bears squeaked out a /-(>
win in overtime, but not before a
( ardinal goal was disallowed.
Although Cal jumped out to

.m early three-goal lead, the
Cardinal stormed back, eventu
ally taking a (i-4 lead. However,
Stanford was shut out in the
fourth quarter, and Cal tied the
game with two minutes remain
ing to set up a frantic finish.
With 15 seconds remaining in
the fourth quarter, the Cardinal
scored what would have been
the game-winning goal, but the
officials negated the goal be
cause of a controversial call that
a Stanford attacker was in the
crease.
I he Bears eventually won in
sudden-death overtime by tak
ing advantage of a one-minute
man-up situation.
The questionable call wiped
away what would have been the
team's most impressive win of
the season, as the Cardinal's stel
lar defense held Cal's highly po
tent attack to just six goals in
regulation. I he defensive effort
was highlighted by Matt
Kennedy's shadowing of the
Hears star attacker, John Prin
cipi, who was held scoreless for
the game.
Despite the disappointment
of the Cal decision, the Card's
Saturday rematch will provide
the opportunity for revenge
against the Bears.
I he Cardinal squad believes
th.it it has played well enough to
receive an at-large berth to the
I SUA National Champi
onships held in St. Louis in mid-
May, but a victory over Cal
would probably seal the deal.
I.iking the Bears into over
time last week, coupled with im
pressive victories like its 8-3 win
over Auburn, has the team con
fident. A victory over Cal, along
with a W'CLL title, would solidi
fy the progress of Stanford's
lacrosse program and speak well
for next year's team, which will
return all but three players.

Goalkeeper Gavin Su and the Stanford men s lacrosse team hope to cap their successful regular
season with a win over rival California on Saturday to seal a USUA National Championship bid.
sophomore (iavin Su and sopho

.ne ranked fourth and fifth, re
spectively. in save percentage in
the W'CLL. Joe's brother. Matt
Kennedy, and junior twins Paul
and lim Sargen comprise the
rest of the strong defensive unit.
Starting two sets of twins has
helped the defense to gel into a
cohesive unit that is capable of
shutting down .in opponent's en
tire game plan.
Although defense i> definitely
the.strong point of this year's
squad, the attack is not too shab
by either. Senior Brvan Dnna
gan leads the team m scoring by
averaging I.3f> points per game,
while freshman standout Kid
Renick is dose behind at 1.24
points per game. The steady bal
ance between offense and de
fense lias been kev for the young
Cardinal team in establishing it
self as a legitimate contender for
the \V(ILL crown this season.
Stanford won its first four
league games of the season and
sat tied for first place with Sono
ma State before the April 7 show
down between the league leaders.
On that day, the Cossacks
handed the Cardinal its first
league loss of tin season by a l.'i
-8 score. In the eves of many
Stanford players, this was the
team's only legitimate league
loss of the season because of the
controversy that followed the
next week during the annual
battle with rival, and defending
league champion, ('.a I.
1 lie Bears squeaked out a /-(>
win in overtime, but not before a
( ardinal goal was disallowed.
Although Cal jumped out to

.m early three-goal lead, the
Cardinal stormed back, eventu
ally taking a (i-4 lead. However,
Stanford was shut out in the
fourth quarter, and Cal tied the
game with two minutes remain
ing to set up a frantic finish.
With 15 seconds remaining in
the fourth quarter, the Cardinal
scored what would have been
the game-winning goal, but the
officials negated the goal be
cause of a controversial call that
a Stanford attacker was in the
crease.
I he Bears eventually won in
sudden-death overtime by tak
ing advantage of a one-minute
man-up situation.
The questionable call wiped
away what would have been the
team's most impressive win of
the season, as the Cardinal's stel
lar defense held Cal's highly po
tent attack to just six goals in
regulation. I he defensive effort
was highlighted by Matt
Kennedy's shadowing of the
Hears star attacker, John Prin
cipi, who was held scoreless for
the game.
Despite the disappointment
of the Cal decision, the Card's
Saturday rematch will provide
the opportunity for revenge
against the Bears.
I he Cardinal squad believes
th.it it has played well enough to
receive an at-large berth to the
I SUA National Champi
onships held in St. Louis in mid-
May, but a victory over Cal
would probably seal the deal.
I.iking the Bears into over
time last week, coupled with im
pressive victories like its 8-3 win
over Auburn, has the team con
fident. A victory over Cal, along
with a W'CLL title, would solidi
fy the progress of Stanford's
lacrosse program and speak well
for next year's team, which will
return all but three players.
