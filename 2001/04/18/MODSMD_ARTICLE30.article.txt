\ ANCOL \ KR, British Columbia (AP) â€” Van
couver Canucks coach Marc Crawford was fined
$15,000 yesterday for criticizing officials after
Came 3 of the Western Conference quarterfinals
against the Colorado Avalanche.
At the same time, tlie* Canucks were fined
$10,000 for violating the league's media policy.
1 appreciate that the league has to support the
officials and from where 1 stand 1 can't make com
ments on the officiating," ('.rawford said yesterday.
I vc been fined for that reason so that's the only
comment I'll make."
(.rawford received total support from the Van
couver front office.
1 understand that the NHL has to protect its of
ficials, but I will pay the fine cheerfullv," general
manager Brian Burke said. "I'm glad Marc spoke
to the media instead of myself because I think I
would have gone even harder."
(.rawford complained about au overtime penal
ty against Todd Bertuzzi that negated a Vancouver
power play in the game the Avalanche won l-li to
take .i 3-0 lead in the best-of-7 series.
1 don't think we got a fair shake at the end, and
1 think the emotional control that the referees
showed was absolutely horrendous," Crawford
said, l odd Bertuzzi at the end of a play wrestles
their guy to the ground, and all of a sudden their
referee is going to be a big hero at the end of the
game and make it a font-on-foui
Bertuz/i's infraction came after Avalanche for
ward Steven Reinprecht was called for hooking
when held up Daniel Sedin 2:07 into overtime.
After the whistle, Bertuzzi wrestled down (Colorado
defenseman Lric Messier, shoved him face first into
the i( e and received a roughing penaltv that negat
ed the Vancouver power play.

"1 was glad to see the referee gave them a penal
ly because my nose was bleeding, my face was
bleeding and they made the right call," said
Messier, who needed four stitches to close the gash
across the bridge of his nose.
Peter Forsberg scored the winner 43 seconds
later.
It can be a little bit of sour grapes for us because
we lost, but it's the way we lost," Crawford said after
the game. "These guys are supposed to be veteran
officials. They are supposed to be above it all and I
thought they were the ones that lost their compo
sure. 1 thought they were argumentative all night
and 1 thought that call at the end of the game was
inexplicable."
Crawford also questioned whether the referees
got the light guy when they whistled Reinprecht
for the original penalty in overtime. Replays
showed they made the correct call.
I hey got the wrong guy, the wrong guy in over
time served the penalty for them," Crawford said.
1 here's a big difference between the size of Rob
lilake and the si/e of Steven Reinprecht. We talked
to them, but no talking back to them because they
know it all and they're above it all. That's a tough
pill to swallow when you make a mistake and you
compound it bv putting the wrong guy in the box."
('.olin (iampbell, the league's director of hockey
operations, t ailed Crawford's comments "entirely
inappropriate."
Colorado coach Bob Hartley agreed.
I (1 rather let my players do the talking on the
i( e," I lartley said after his team practiced yesterday
morning. "It was a well-officiated game. It was a
tough game to referee. It was a dirty game."
Post-game media access to the Canucks' dressing
room was denied for approximately 30 minutes.
