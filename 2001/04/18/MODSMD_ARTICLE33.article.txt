## Foreign workers face deportation after dot-com layoffs 
### JEFF NEGRETTE 
1 lie heated controversy of last year
over proposed federal laws permitting
more immigrants to work as professionals
in the United States has returned as part of
the fallout from the dot-com shakeout.
1 his time hist year, radical growth in
the high-tech sector left many employers
clamoring tor high-tech workers. With
their needs unmet bv the local labor pool,
many Silicon Valley firms branched over
seas to recruit foreign nationals, hoping to
fill the void with the best and brightest
workers available worldwide.
Now, just 1 2 months later, many of these
same firms are facing ( ash shortages and
even bankruptcy, leaving employees in
search of new- jobs. While the difficulties of
being laid-off plague even job seeker, im
migrants working here on temporary visas
face potential deportation when their jobs
disappear. Despite the fervor surrounding
this issue and the resulting amendments to
labor laws, the issue of deportation has
never been adequately resolved.
1 he U.S. Congress sets the number of
immigrants— who are termed "alien ben
eficiaries" by the Immigration and Natu
ralization Service — allowed to enter the
country for work. In the first step of the
immigration process, the employer seek
ing workers files an application with the
Department of Labor, which evaluates the
typical compensation levels for compara
bly situated I .S. professionals and assesses
the availability of suitable U.S. workers tor
the sought-after position.

to increase the labor supply to deflate

wages. Diligent oversight also reduces
the power advantage an emplover has
over immigrant workers, w ho are will

.uul may even come from sweatshop
style working conditions.
A third step ( alls for the Labor De
partment to evaluate the alien benefi
ciary's qualifications for the intended
position. All applicants must have suc
cessfully completed a bachelor's de
gree-equivalent at a post-secondary
education that has been certified bv
the INS. I bis serves to restrict the ap
plicability of the program to qualified
professionals rather than being avail
able to .ill labor types.
After three to six months, massive
paperwork and the payment of vari
ous fees, the alien beneficiary is autho
rized to work for the sponsoring em
ployer under an HI-It visa. 1 his tem
porary employment authorization
lasts fora period of three years and

can be extended for an additional three.
While six years is the maximum duration
permitted, alien beneficiaries may work for
different employers within that period,
though each subsequent employer must
individually seoite an additional Hl-B
visa.
()ne final constraint applies to 111 -B ap
plicants. 1 lie federal government restricts
the number of visas granted each vear, wit h

the start date Ix'ginning in October. Six
months into the lisi.il 1999-2000 year, this

By isas. ( ongrcss opened the dooi to even
more foreign nationals, who thev hoped
would continue to fuel the unprecedented
growth of the high-tech sector. I ufortu
nately. labor shortages did not prove to be
the bottleneck that slowed local and na-

tional economies. Now that countless start
ups have collapsed and major technology
companies have announced massive lay
offs io contend with the downturn, many

of these temporary workers are the
first to be dismissed.
Without sponsorship, H 1-B hold
ers have exactly 10 davs to find anoth
er employer and secure another visa.
Failure to do so leaves an immigrant
subject to deportation and, in the
worst case, forbidden to return to the
I nited States for 10 years. While for
mer-111-b holders still in the country
are unlikely to make the "Most Want
ed list of the INS. these circumstances
are more than a little unsettling.
I'he potential for immediate de
portation forces policy makers to again
wrestle with the difficult questions of
fairness toward Hl-B holders. After
securing salary equity with their U.S.
counterparts, the Labor Department
still leaves them at a serious disadvan
tage when plans go awry.
Should H 1-B holders be given ad
ditional protection, either proy ided by
sponsoring employers or bv the gov-

ernment, or do (in rent policies reflect the
best economic interests of the l-nited
States?
Before addressing the question of who
should pay for supporting displaced 1 li
bs. it is first important to understand
whether any support should be provided
at all. I his matter is best evaluated from an
analy sis <>1 the intentions and ambitions of
the original legislation, known as the Ini

migration and Nationality Act and the
American Competitiveness and Work
force Improvement Act.
By ottering only a three-year term tor
H 1 -B applic ants, the acts send a clear mes
sage that the program is meant to foster a
very short-term relationship with foreign
nationals. Furthermore, the Hl-B visa
program does not otter conversion to per
manent resident or "green card" status.
Also relevant is the strict application of
visa quotas. I he U.S. government has ex
plicitly communicated its desire to tightly
control the maximum number of foreign
nationals and is unlikely to provide any
accommodations that might increase this
number or otherwise keep it any higher
than it must be. The Labor Department's
efforts to validate employers' expressed
need for additional labor also indicates a
general unwillingness to provide for any
immigrants beyond the amount absolute
ly necessary.
In 1998, (Congress enacted a number of
changes to the American Competitiveness
and Workforce Improvement Act, most of
which were targeted at protecting U.S.
workers from companies who unfairly re
placed domestic worker with foreign one,
while also serving to protect Hl-B holders
from being mistreated by U.S. employers.
Provisions included prohibition of hir
ing 111-IVs to fill previously laid-ott posi
tions and mandatory wage equity be
tween the two types of workers. Both pro
visions were also protected by "whistle-

blower clauses that helped en
force compliance, lint financial
penalties on corporate transgres
sors were modest, ranging from
$1,000 to $3 5,000 per violation.
1 his dollar range represents the
priorities of legislators: I lie high
est fines were reserved for cases
where I .S. workers were laid ofl
unfairK. I he smaller penalties ap
plied when foreign nationals'
i iglits were violated.
I he ostensibh generous pro
tections of salary equitv among
IH-B holders serves a more do
mestic labor interest as well. B\
keeping wages constant between
foreign and domestic workers,
Hl-B holders are not iompetitive
on cost alone. Sponsoi ingetnplov
ei s must n ulv be fac ing a shortage
of labor before thev will find for
eign sources attractive.
I lie apparent conclusion from
this review of the statutes seems to
indicate the 1 J 1-B program is not so
interested in recruiting and retain
ing the world's best high-tec li talent.
Instead, it appears to have been
constituted for the purposes of
temporariK relieving labor short
ages where tliev arose until I S.
labor could migrate to the demand.

While this conclusion leaves lim
ited potential for former Hl-B
holders, it brings to light what might
be a misguided labor policy
wrapped in good intentions. Aside
from the social interests ottended bv
deporting people after a mere 10
da\s of unemployment, protecting
local labor may come at too great of
a cost. 'I o the extent foreign nation
als permanentlv integrate into the
American labor force, they otter a
tremendous store of human capital
unavailable domcsticallv.
I lie Hl-B visa could serve .is a
recruiting tool to capture the
world's finest knowledge workers
in a manner that would effect ivel\
ensure the continued success of
the I S. economv relative to the
i est of the world. Furthermore, as
suming employment terms are in
fact equitable, excluding foreign
nationals effect ivel\ serves to sub
sidize an under-performing do
mestic labor pool.
If I .S. labor polica-makers
allow ibis deportation dvnamic to
persist, the\ could Ik* sending a
( hilling message to workers con

visions as tliev stand, the United
States not onh compromises its
store of intellectual resources
today, but threatens to jeopardize
its talent pool for vears to come.
