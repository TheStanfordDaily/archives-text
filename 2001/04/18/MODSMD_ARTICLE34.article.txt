## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
On April 14, over 200 entre
preneurs «nul students gath
ered tor the Conference tor
Asian-American Leaders in
Technology.
The conference was first
organized bv the Stanford So
ciety of Asian-American Kngi
neers in 1098. The confer
ence is aimed .it bringing to
gether different high-tech
sectors for the Asian Ameri
can engineering community,
as well as for the Stanford
community at large.
"This conference ties in well
with our three missions," said
senior Rence Cheung, who is
the president of the society.
"First, the conference aims
to provide a business network
for Stanford students. Second,
we want to introduce engi
neering students to the diverse
career options available in
other fields. Finally, we want to
promote awareness of technol
ogy and business develop
ments in the Asia / Pacific re
gion," ('.heung said.
Senior Christopher long,
co-director for the event, said,
"Our key mission was to bring
leaders in technology and eti
trepreneurship to share ideas
on how to be more productive
and successful."
Speakers included such
prominent names as Steve
Chu. professor of physics at
Stanford and a Nobel Prize
winner; S.B. Woo, former
lieutenant governor of
Delaware and William 1 ai,
managing director and gener
al partner of Institutional
Venture Partners.
The keynote speaker, Steve
Chu, titled his address, "A
Random Walk in Science." He
discussed the Heisenberg un
certainty principle, atomic
clocks, changes in gravity,
Bose-Kinstein condensates,

laser manipulation <>t DMA
.incl many other cutting-edge
topics in phvsics.
"The knowledge we acquire
is additive," Clhu said. "I en
tourage you all to have the
most rigorous training, espe
cially when young."
Biian (lhan, (Ilass <>l 1993
and the director of ()racle, said,

he said.
Chus lecture was followed
bv a panel discussion with a va
riety of technology leaders.
Among them was Michael
Yang, chairman and co
founder of NetC.eo and co
founder of MvSimon. Both are
companies tli.it provide com
puter services.
"1 think |this conference] is a
great idea. It is a great ton 1111 for
Silicon Valley engineers, provid
ing a network where we can share
our aspirations," Yang said.
Yang added, "Asian-Ameri
cans should assume the role of
leaders, not just of successful
people living comfortably. We
have to reach out toward other
people, getting more involved

The next event was a speech
from S.B. Woo. who exhorted
die community to gain a stronger
voice through political activism.
Observers from different
companies were also present.
