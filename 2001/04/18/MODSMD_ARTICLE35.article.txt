Willi tlit' (iSß's Bishop Auditorium tilled to
capacity, Michael Kisner. chairman and chief
executive officer of the Walt l)isne\ Corpora
tion, made the keynote speech at the Future of
(Content (inference on April 1 4.
Kisner spoke about the role of technology in
film " Technology has historically been a friend
of content," he s.iid. "[lt lias| invitee his on board
the Titanic ... to walk among the dinosaurs."
But he warned that, ultimately, it is great con
tent. and not great technology, that ci eates suc -
cessful products. Me pointed out tlu- recent
commercial failure of the special effects-filled,
but critically panned, film. "Battlefield Karth,"
as an example that technology is not a cure-all.
"The essential nature of content is its time
lessness ... .is technolog\ has changed, the es
sential nature of content li.is remained the
same; it's all about story telling." Kisner s.iid, I It
said that, while we may be talking about M Pit's,
codec sand streaming media .is advanced ways
to deliver content today, sue li tec Imology will be
obsolete and useless in 20 vears, going the way
of the 8-track. "New delivery systems are like
newly added colors to .111 artist's palette. [Ulti
mately,] its about the timeless stories."
Kisner also spent some time explaining Dis
ney's efforts to defend its intellectual property
rights on the Internet. He likened computer
piracy to stealing apples from a storekeeper,
saying, "Intellectual property rights are no dif
ferent than regular property rights... I heft will
not be tolerated in any form."
Kisner also reflected on his 17-year tenure at
the helm of Disnev. one of the world's biggest
entertainment entities. "I knew that I had taken
over .1 great entertainment institution." he said.
I le discussed his company's success in creating a
supportive environment where great content
creators could be cultivated, but added that c re
ating great content was not an exact sc icnce.
While discussing the success of Miramax
Films, which Disney owns, Kisner managed to
plug one of its newly released products. "Mira
max demonstrated [its value] in 'Bridget Jones's
Diary,' which happens to be showing at the C len
turv lb in Mountain View," lie said.
Kisner concluded his speech bv praising the
members of the audience who will be part of the

ik'xi generation of content creators. "In the
vears to tome, I have faith in the future. I have
faith in von," lie said.
Kd I sc. .1 first-vear business student, said of
the speech, "I liked it; he had a lot of tilings to
sa\ 11c was fun ... The piracy issue hit it home;
he addressed it well."
It was very good, but very general," said
k\ le Alisharan, .i junior inajorig in Knglish and
minoring in computer science.

111 addition to Kisner's keynote speech, the
conference featured 12 different panels, each
lasting for 75 minutes. Fhe topics ranged from
"Intellectual Property in .1 Digital Age" to' Klec
tronic Publishing" and "Interactive (laming."
At the "Broadband Infrastructure" panel,
various experts from infrastructure compa
nies like Kxcite(« Home and Koudcloud dis
cussed the future of using broadband to deliv
er new media. The panelists agreed that, until
now, companies had built Internet infrastruc
ture not because they would make money
right away, but because of the huge potential
of future revenues based on high-speed con
tent delivery.
Jay Goldin, co-founder and director of busi
ness development at Digital Fountain, Inc . — a
company specializing in server-based content
delivery optimizations — explained that build
ing broadband technology' is a smaller obstacle
than the problem of cost. "If we put in one serv
er for each household, we c an't build a business.
If we got it down to where we pav 20cents to see
a movie." then there was potential tot profit,
he said.
Moderator Ahmed Datoo pointed out that

broadband expansion was a "chicken-and-egg"
problem. (lompanies would onlv expand infra
structure if there was public demand tor it, but
where s the demand going to come from?
Shailesh Shukla, vice president of strategy
and business development .it Redback Net
works — another company specializing in
bi oadband infrastructure — was more direct.
"1 think it's all about making monev at the end
of the dav."
I he panel also debated about the feasibility
of video-on-demand (e.g. renting movies on the
Internet to view on the computer). So far, test
trials in the United States have shown a lack of
interest in video-on-demand, but Seth Kenvin,
vice president at Big Band Networks, believes
that, once technology barriers such as slow and
poor-quality streaming video are eliminated,
video-on-demand will become a hot item. "Ulti
mately, .")() million Blockbuster users can't be
wrong. [Video-on-demand] is a superior service
to cassette rental," he said.
But Shukla disagreed, "Video-on-demand
may not be the killer application," he said, ac
cording to Shukla, broadband expansion aimed
toward specific corporate customers who had
particular content delivery needs is where the
profits may lay.
With regard to new content-delivery tech
nology, Da too said," I here's a whole suite of ap
plications coming out now to improve quality of
services, such as stream technology, though the
trend is shifting towards tile downloads."
I he panelists touched on how the monopo
listic tendencies of cable companies might hin
der broadband development because these
companies would not be motivated to improve
technology. They also discussed the fact that
countries like Singapore and Germany are
ahead of the I nited States in building Internet
infrastructure.
Alisharan said he enjoyed the conference. "I
came last year [as well]; this is the area I'm inter
ested in.the distribution of traditional media on
the Internet."
Steven Bernstein, an entertainment and
media strategy consultant at I'ricewaterhouseC
oopers and moderator of the "Digital Effects"
panel, said th.it the future of content delivery
rested with "new distribution channels, like dig
ital cinema, Internet media, personal data
recorders (like I ivo). There are a number of
[technical] issues to work out before it happens,
but its going to completely change the way peo
ple view and interact with content."
"It's a tremendous opportunity for Stan
ford students to be exposed to the new
trends of media content," Bernstein said of
the conference.

It was very good, but very general," said
k\ le Alisharan, .i junior inajorig in Knglish and
minoring in computer science.

111 addition to Kisner's keynote speech, the
conference featured 12 different panels, each
lasting for 75 minutes. Fhe topics ranged from
"Intellectual Property in .1 Digital Age" to' Klec
tronic Publishing" and "Interactive (laming."
At the "Broadband Infrastructure" panel,
various experts from infrastructure compa
nies like Kxcite(« Home and Koudcloud dis
cussed the future of using broadband to deliv
er new media. The panelists agreed that, until
now, companies had built Internet infrastruc
ture not because they would make money
right away, but because of the huge potential
of future revenues based on high-speed con
tent delivery.
Jay Goldin, co-founder and director of busi
ness development at Digital Fountain, Inc . — a
company specializing in server-based content
delivery optimizations — explained that build
ing broadband technology' is a smaller obstacle
than the problem of cost. "If we put in one serv
er for each household, we c an't build a business.
If we got it down to where we pav 20cents to see
a movie." then there was potential tot profit,
he said.
Moderator Ahmed Datoo pointed out that

broadband expansion was a "chicken-and-egg"
problem. (lompanies would onlv expand infra
structure if there was public demand tor it, but
where s the demand going to come from?
Shailesh Shukla, vice president of strategy
and business development .it Redback Net
works — another company specializing in
bi oadband infrastructure — was more direct.
"1 think it's all about making monev at the end
of the dav."
I he panel also debated about the feasibility
of video-on-demand (e.g. renting movies on the
Internet to view on the computer). So far, test
trials in the United States have shown a lack of
interest in video-on-demand, but Seth Kenvin,
vice president at Big Band Networks, believes
that, once technology barriers such as slow and
poor-quality streaming video are eliminated,
video-on-demand will become a hot item. "Ulti
mately, .")() million Blockbuster users can't be
wrong. [Video-on-demand] is a superior service
to cassette rental," he said.
But Shukla disagreed, "Video-on-demand
may not be the killer application," he said, ac
cording to Shukla, broadband expansion aimed
toward specific corporate customers who had
particular content delivery needs is where the
profits may lay.
With regard to new content-delivery tech
nology, Da too said," I here's a whole suite of ap
plications coming out now to improve quality of
services, such as stream technology, though the
trend is shifting towards tile downloads."
I he panelists touched on how the monopo
listic tendencies of cable companies might hin
der broadband development because these
companies would not be motivated to improve
technology. They also discussed the fact that
countries like Singapore and Germany are
ahead of the I nited States in building Internet
infrastructure.
Alisharan said he enjoyed the conference. "I
came last year [as well]; this is the area I'm inter
ested in.the distribution of traditional media on
the Internet."
Steven Bernstein, an entertainment and
media strategy consultant at I'ricewaterhouseC
oopers and moderator of the "Digital Effects"
panel, said th.it the future of content delivery
rested with "new distribution channels, like dig
ital cinema, Internet media, personal data
recorders (like I ivo). There are a number of
[technical] issues to work out before it happens,
but its going to completely change the way peo
ple view and interact with content."
"It's a tremendous opportunity for Stan
ford students to be exposed to the new
trends of media content," Bernstein said of
the conference.

Kisner spoke about the role of technology in
film " Technology has historically been a friend
of content," he s.iid. "[lt lias| invitee his on board
the Titanic ... to walk among the dinosaurs."
But he warned that, ultimately, it is great con
tent. and not great technology, that ci eates suc -
cessful products. Me pointed out tlu- recent
commercial failure of the special effects-filled,
but critically panned, film. "Battlefield Karth,"
as an example that technology is not a cure-all.
"The essential nature of content is its time
lessness ... .is technolog\ has changed, the es
sential nature of content li.is remained the
same; it's all about story telling." Kisner s.iid, I It
said that, while we may be talking about M Pit's,
codec sand streaming media .is advanced ways
to deliver content today, sue li tec Imology will be
obsolete and useless in 20 vears, going the way
of the 8-track. "New delivery systems are like
newly added colors to .111 artist's palette. [Ulti
mately,] its about the timeless stories."
Kisner also spent some time explaining Dis
ney's efforts to defend its intellectual property
rights on the Internet. He likened computer
piracy to stealing apples from a storekeeper,

ferent than regular property rights... I heft will
not be tolerated in any form."

ating great content was not an exact sc icnce.
While discussing the success of Miramax

plug one of its newly released products. "Mira
max demonstrated [its value] in 'Bridget Jones's
Diary,' which happens to be showing at the C len
turv lb in Mountain View," lie said.
Kisner concluded his speech bv praising the
members of the audience who will be part of the

faith in von," lie said.
