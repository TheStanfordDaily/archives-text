# Feeling stressed? Here's the way to handle pressure
## 
### ADELINE AZRACK 
Pressure is something that most Stan
ford students are used to dealing with. Most
of us would not be here if we were not able
to deal with pressure constructively and
even use it to our advantage. But some
times this ability can lead us to forget or dis
count the effects pressure can have on our
bodies, spirits and the decisions we make.
()ften the best way to begin dealing with
a problem like pressure is to identify its
roots. It may help you to make a quick list of
your sources of pressure, the feelings asso
ciated with it and how pressure is affecting
you physically and emotionally. Here are
some ideas, gleaned from campus psychol
ogists and students, to help you get started.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Services at
Cowell, divides pressure into two broad
categories: internal and external. Internal
pressure derives from our self-expecta
tions. goals and accompanying notions of
success and failure. While influenced bv
out parents, friends, mentors and com
munities, internal pressure is something
that we create for ourselves and that helps
us to achieve our goals, whether it is fin
ishing a paper or pursuing a particular ca
reer path.
External pressure can come from manv
sources, some of whit h are mui h easier to
identity than others. Parents, foi example,
top many Stanford students' lists of easily
identifiable sources of pressure.
One freshman, who prefers to remain
anonymous, admitted that she is suddenly
questioning whether or not she yvants to re
main a pre medical student. "I'm not sure it
medicine is what I'm really interested in,"
she- said. "But my parents are convinced
tli.it I want to be ,i doctor. 1 low could I ever
it'll them otherwise?" Another student, a se
nior who is also pre medical, agreed, saving,
'It's hard to separate what 1 want from
what mv parents want. Am I doing this for
myself or for them?''
Peer pressure is also common, although
perhaps not in the same sense in which
pressure is most often nsetl b\ parents .intl
educators. For many Stanford students,
peer pressure is not explicitly imposed, but
comes out of a genuine desire to fit in and
spend time with the people we t are about.

"Students often feel torn between their
academic and personal lives," Martinez
said. "They want to have gtx>d relation
ships. vet they also want to get their work
done. There is enormous pressure to find a
balance." Finding this balance, or identify
ing what areas of one's lite are the most re
warding and deserve the most attention, is

often result
from trving
to "do it all."
Another
form of so
cial. or peer
pressure, is
ilit- pressure
to engage in
cert a i n
types of be
havior, in
cluding. tor
exa in pie,
dieting, ex-

e r c is i n g,
partying or even pulling an all-nighter to
stuch for an exam. Such pressure can both
help us and hurt us, and the line between
the two is often verv subtle.
For example, pressure to exercise can
motivate us to get out of our rooms and
enjo\ some fresh air — a wonderful wa\ to
deal with stress and improve one's health.
But it can also lead us to overdo it. putting
us at risk for injun or serious psvc hologit al
and health complications. In the words of
one junior woman," Evenone here \salums
running! Is this reallv a good thing?"
Perhaps the tvpe of pressure most com
mon here at Stanford, and the most diffi
< ult to it lent if \. is the pressure to "do some
thing great with our lives." Kverv time I see
m\ parents' friends, I reach invself for the
inevitable cjuestion, "So, vou go to Stan
ford? Wow. What do vou plan to do when
vou graduate? l he implication is that I
must be planning on doing something

highly respectable.
While 1 always have some acceptable re
sponse prepared, the truth of the matter is
that 1 do not know exactly what 1 want todo
with the rest of mv life. Yet I feel that to
admit this would reflect badly, not on my
own self-worth and intelligence, but on mv
family and even Stanford.

Like peer pressure, pressure to "make
something ol ourselves" can also have both
positive and negative effects. "It can force us
to reassess what we are doing and where we
are going; to look at all ol the possible di
rections we c an go in and evaluate our c in -
tent lifestvle," Marline/, said. It can moti

proud and authentic? How does pressure
affect your Ixklv? Are you tense or anxious?
Are you listening to your body's needs with
respect to food, sleep, exercise, substance
use and sexual activity?
Often, pressure manifests itself as stress
and anxiety. CAPS suggests that you may
find it helpful to practice relaxation tech
niques, such as visualization, meditation,
gentle exercise or talking to a friend, when
you feel anxious.
There are also several excellent and en
tertaining b(K)ks about handling stress and
pressure. Dr. Burg recommends "The Re
laxation and Stress Reduction Workbook"
(Martha Davis et al.) in particular. "This is a
great book tor anyone who is dealing with
pressure, anxiety, depression or stress," he
said. "Each chapter describes a different
coping strategy. It is a very practical ux)l
that can help us all."
Often, pressure is something that may
be contusing or troubling you enough to
merit talking it through with a trained
counselor. Even it yon are not feeling
truly depressed, you may find it helpful to
drop by the Bridge or call it at 723-3392.
Or, make an appointment at CAPS by
calling 723-3785. The Bridge is complete
ly anonymous, free, and available 24
hours a day. Bridge staffers can help you
identity your sources of pressure and how
they are affecting you, and help you to
problem-solve.
('.APS, while not anonymous, is also free
tor up to 10 sessions, and their counselors,
unlike Bridge counselors, are profession
ally trained. Both the Bridge and CAPS
offer comfortable and private places to
vent and explore your feelings. They can
also provide you with referral services for
support groups.
We should all be proud of how well we
handle pressure and recognize how it can
work to our advantage. But we must also be
aware of how it can subtly, and not-so-sub
tly, affect our self-confidence, happiness
.ind physical health. Begin a dialogue with
yourselves and your friends about how to
respond to pressure while staying to true to
your own needs and desires.

Are you listening to your body's needs with

Often, pressure manifests itself as stress
and anxiety. CAPS suggests that you may
find it helpful to practice relaxation tech
niques, such as visualization, meditation,
gentle exercise or talking to a friend, when
you feel anxious.
There are also several excellent and en
tertaining b(K)ks about handling stress and
pressure. Dr. Burg recommends "The Re

(Martha Davis et al.) in particular. "This is a
great book tor anyone who is dealing with

said. "Each chapter describes a different

that can help us all."
Often, pressure is something that may

Or, make an appointment at CAPS by
calling 723-3785. The Bridge is complete

they are affecting you, and help you to

tor up to 10 sessions, and their counselors,
unlike Bridge counselors, are profession

offer comfortable and private places to

also provide you with referral services for
support groups.
We should all be proud of how well we
handle pressure and recognize how it can
work to our advantage. But we must also be
aware of how it can subtly, and not-so-sub
tly, affect our self-confidence, happiness
.ind physical health. Begin a dialogue with
yourselves and your friends about how to
respond to pressure while staying to true to
your own needs and desires.

Pressure is something that most Stan
ford students are used to dealing with. Most
of us would not be here if we were not able
to deal with pressure constructively and
even use it to our advantage. But some
times this ability can lead us to forget or dis
count the effects pressure can have on our
bodies, spirits and the decisions we make.
()ften the best way to begin dealing with
a problem like pressure is to identify its
roots. It may help you to make a quick list of
your sources of pressure, the feelings asso
ciated with it and how pressure is affecting
you physically and emotionally. Here are
some ideas, gleaned from campus psychol
ogists and students, to help you get started.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Services at
Cowell, divides pressure into two broad
categories: internal and external. Internal
pressure derives from our self-expecta
tions. goals and accompanying notions of
success and failure. While influenced bv
out parents, friends, mentors and com
munities, internal pressure is something
that we create for ourselves and that helps
us to achieve our goals, whether it is fin
ishing a paper or pursuing a particular ca
reer path.
External pressure can come from manv
sources, some of whit h are mui h easier to
identity than others. Parents, foi example,
top many Stanford students' lists of easily
identifiable sources of pressure.
One freshman, who prefers to remain
anonymous, admitted that she is suddenly
questioning whether or not she yvants to re
main a pre medical student. "I'm not sure it
medicine is what I'm really interested in,"
she- said. "But my parents are convinced
tli.it I want to be ,i doctor. 1 low could I ever
it'll them otherwise?" Another student, a se
nior who is also pre medical, agreed, saving,
'It's hard to separate what 1 want from
what mv parents want. Am I doing this for
myself or for them?''
Peer pressure is also common, although
perhaps not in the same sense in which
pressure is most often nsetl b\ parents .intl
educators. For many Stanford students,
peer pressure is not explicitly imposed, but
comes out of a genuine desire to fit in and
spend time with the people we t are about.

"Students often feel torn between their
academic and personal lives," Martinez
said. "They want to have gtx>d relation
ships. vet they also want to get their work
done. There is enormous pressure to find a
balance." Finding this balance, or identify
ing what areas of one's lite are the most re
warding and deserve the most attention, is

dieting, ex-

e r c is i n g,
partying or even pulling an all-nighter to
stuch for an exam. Such pressure can both
help us and hurt us, and the line between
the two is often verv subtle.
For example, pressure to exercise can
motivate us to get out of our rooms and
enjo\ some fresh air — a wonderful wa\ to
deal with stress and improve one's health.
But it can also lead us to overdo it. putting
us at risk for injun or serious psvc hologit al

identity your sources of pressure and how
they are affecting you, and help you to

tor up to 10 sessions, and their counselors,
unlike Bridge counselors, are profession

We should all be proud of how well we
handle pressure and recognize how it can
work to our advantage. But we must also be
aware of how it can subtly, and not-so-sub
tly, affect our self-confidence, happiness

yourselves and your friends about how to
respond to pressure while staying to true to
your own needs and desires.
