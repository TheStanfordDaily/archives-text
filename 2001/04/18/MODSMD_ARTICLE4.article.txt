I allent and Wolff choose the fiction writers,
.md Simone di Piero, Ken Fields and Boland
choose the poets.
The applicants tend to Ik- in theit late L'Os or
earlv Ms, Wolff said, though the program's Web
site sjK-c ifies that "c hronologit al age is not a con
sideration. Fellows are regarded as working
artists, intent upon practicing and
perfecting their craft. There are no
auricular requirements other than
workshop attendance, and the pro
gram otters no degree."
"Most [of the fellows] have been
working in addition to writing,
which is important," as it shows they
can "handle real life.' Wolff said.
"Most already have their [mas
ter's of tine arts and] many of them
have a first lx>ok on the wav to being
ready," Boland said.
Previous Stegner fellows include
such renowned authors as Lirrv
McMurtry, Raymond Carver,
Nancy Packer, Lan Samantha
Change and Scott 1 m ow, and poets
Robert Pinsky and former Poet
laureate Robert Hass.
" I his is trulv a unique program.
It buys time for young winters at a
crucial moment of their develop
ment. It offers them the chance to

complete their first books in the
company — and with the challenge
—of'other excellent young writers,"
Boland said. "Stanford deserves
enormous credit for sheltering this
program, and it's part of the wider
commitment to the arts and hu
manities here."
