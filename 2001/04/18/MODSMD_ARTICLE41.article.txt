UC-Davis .itiin>nut i'<l the discovery of origi
nal documents l>\ |i>or Sikorsk\ —a famous

hclicoptct designer from the 1950s
discussing the aerodynamics of
baseballs. Found in a ('ape ( lod attic,
the documents referenced Siko
isk\ s experiments into the physics
of a baseball's flight path at speeds
ovei 95 miles per lioui and less than
10 miles pel hour.
I liese doc uments, which had
been losi tot ovei 10 vears, spurred
the researc hei and a group of stw
dents at I ('.-Davis to repe.it the ex
periments on tlicit own. Fhe\ per
formed two experiments, the firs of
\\ 11i« 11 was conducted at the 1006
Olympic (..lines in Atlanta. I hev set
up two high-speed video cameras,
one between second and 111 ii < I base

.iiul oiu' behind home plate, and filmed a se
ries <>l |)it< lie s with differing spins and at dif
ferent speeds.
In the second experiment. the\ used seven
cameras to film halls with torn pieces of re
flective tape on them thrown h\ a pitching
mat hine. I he advantage of the experimental
design lies in the freedom of the baseball. All
previous experiments had been done in wind
tunnels with the baseball tethered to some
thing. Sikorsk\ s method allowed obsei vat ion
of the baseball in its actual functioning envi
ronment in real-life situations.
I he i eseart hers were able tot alt ulate spin
rates and veltx ities and, from that, were able
to make predictions of flight paths to within
three inches of at curat v. I lie information
t ollet let I will be helpful lot the improvement
ol pi It liei s.it all levels.
Researt hers in (icrmam at the University
of Stuttgart s.i\ the\ have a w.iy to maket lotli
ing that could provide all the power anvone
would need f< m portable tlevices like tnp.'i
players, I'alni IMlots or cellular plumes.
I'lie researchers have fabricated fibers
that generate electricit\ when exposed to
light and can be woven into machine-wash
able clothing, fhese fibers would work like
the photovoltaic cells found in solai calcula
tors todav.

I lie fibers sandwich tluee lavei s of amor
phous sili(on between two electrodes that
conduct electricity. I lie top layer is laced
with elet tron-rii li impurities, and the bottom
layer has electron-poor substances injected
into it. I he middle layer is kept in its natural

state, so that when light hits the top elec
trode. it excites electrons in the top silicon
lavei. causing them to flow down to the elet -
tron-poor laver. Ibis current flow powers
the tlevices a i it I can even be used to c barge
batteries.
fhe researt lieis found that this arrange
ment can be molded into a cvlinchic.il form
and still be effective. According to the ic
se.iic hers, the amorphous silicon tliev use foi
the s.ike of pliabilitv is less effit it-ill than the
c 'rv st alii lie form used in calculator, but tliev
feel that the potential exists lot pragmatic use
of the new tec huologv.
In an article in the \ptil 12 issue t>f Nature,
researchers offet a new opinion about the
cause of death foi some victims of the erup
tion of Mt. \Csnv ins m \ I). 7'.).
I lie eruption generated sue ha violent
and immediate explosion of ash that
some remains of the victims were pie
served in the ash la vers. I he positions ol
the victims remains suggest tliev died

Skeletons neai the coast m the nearbv
town of I lei t ulaileum have a different pos
ture that leads researchers it) believe then
cause of death was different. I he In si wave
of I he eruption was piohahlv a
heal wave of :")()() tlegi ees (ielsius. file pet>-

pie on the coast suffered most because they
were at the bottom of a 20-meter cliff. A
denser c oniponent of the wave is thought to
have swept through there, bursting into the
chambers of the hiding people.
I liese skeletons had artic ulatcd fractures,

something common with incinerated
bodies. Flexion in the hands and feet
were also observed, a reflex that oc
curs nndei exlremeh high tempera
lures. Patterns in the ash around the
bodies indicate that intense he.it de
stroved some of the flesh. Ihe re
searchers ( oik hided from the evi
deiK < ( olle< ted tli.it the SO spec imens
the\ found died instantl\ from having
.1 large part of their bodies vapori/ed
b\ the heat.
l lie .\|>lll 1 issue of Science fea
tures an art it le about the wa\ owls use
iheii heai ing to lo< ale prev. In exper
iments using barn owls, reseai ( hers at
(laliech li.ive found «>ill tli.it the owls

use .1 system of mtcT.mi.il level differences
.ind intet.iur.il time differences to make
these |>r< (Ik iioiis.
lntei.iur.il level differences relers to the
sens, it ion that sound coming Ironi vour right
side will sound loudei in the i iglit ear than in
the lelt. liiteraur.il time diflerciu es siniplv
relers to the fact that von would hear the
sound lii si with the i ight ear.
Researchers tried to lind out how the
owl's neurons in the interior colliculus
processed this information. l'liev put head
phones on I I owls and. iisiiig different pat
terns ol sounds, the\ observed how the owls
i esponded.
I mil this time, neurons were known to
work onl\ in an additive wav. Ihe owls, it was
believed, would sum the stimulatorx mpiiis
thc\ receive. and, il the summed inputs ex
ceed threshold, the neuron lives.
I lie 1 esc.ii i lici s. however, c one luded that
then d.ii.i cast doubt on ibis traditional
model. Instead, they proposed a multiplica
tive mode l ol the neuronal response that was
( .)K pert eni ,ic ( urate.
Neuronal mulliplic ation is believed to be
imolved in otliet complex functions, like
keeping an image si 111 during movement,
but this has not yet been proven. 1 lie re
searchers s.i\ that the next step is to figure
oiii how n happens iieui oph\siologicallv.
