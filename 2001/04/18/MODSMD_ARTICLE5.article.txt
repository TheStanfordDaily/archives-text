And thev got one.
I lie stunt was just another seg
ment foi the new student-pnxiuced
television variety show, "The
Scoop," which premiered Monday
night ;ii p.m. on SGBN. Along
with co-host Anne Gregory, .1 ju
nior, the duo hit the .iii waves with a
one-hour show that, in Martinez's
words, is "a mixture of 'Saturday
Night Live,' Mad I V,' 'The Daily
Show' and 'Hie View.'"
Hie show will air every week
night, with a new show even Mon
dav that's repeated four other times
in the week.
I he premiere opened with a skit
that poked fun .it sororitv girls and
continued with a dance audition
pa rod \ and post-election interviews
with the losing candidates. Because
of technical difficulties, the final 20
minutes of the premiere could not
be viewed. However, Martinez
promises that the problem lias been
fixed .md the remainder of the

clearly.
"We put the show on digital

so the show runs smoothh now."
Aside from the rugbv charade,
future shows will feature .1 mock
newscast, celebrit\ impersonations,
music al guests and dam e numbers.
"Think 12 |. Ijo's," Gregory said.
And, of course, 110 variety show is
