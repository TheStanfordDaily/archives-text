1977
On April 19, 1077. I lie Daily printed an article
about protesters at the Stanford Rescan h Institute.
I wo weeks have passed since the Stanford Re
search Institute was supposed to rcinoyc "Stanlord"
from its name, but the change has \ct to be made.
"Separated from the I niversih |.m. l.'t, 1970, SRI
was given five years to change its name toayoid inler
encesof connection with the I niyersity. I he Hoard ol
I rustees extended the deadline to April 1, 1077.
(higinall) a Stanford affiliate, SRI was the target
of extensive protests and demonstrations In students.
I he Api il .Srd Movement, an organization ol student
.1111\ Ists. demanded that SRI (case all itschemii aland
biological warfare and war-related research.
Rather than discontinue the resean h, the Board
of 11 ustees voted to make SRI independent."
Bottom line: To this day, no one knows what goes on at SRI;
"tanford" was removed from the name, but the S" remains.
