# Librarian goes virtual
## 
### USA MENDELMAN 
America's first library Webmaster, for
mer Stanford librarian Iconise Addis, was
recently honored In the American Li
brary - Association tor her innovative role
in the creation of the I nited States's first
virtual library.
Addis, the* recipient of the 2001 Clay
lord Await 1 from the Libra it and Infor
mation 1 ethnology Association of the as
sociation, retired from her position as as
sociate head librarian at the Stanford 1 .in
ear Accelerator Center in 1094, but her
impact on the technological revolution
has not been forgotten.
Addis saw the potential to make an ex
isting internal SI A(' database available to
the entire world in 1001, when physicist
Paul Kun/ returned to SI AC from Eu
rope having learned of a working Web
site .it the European phvsics organization
( ER\ Bcrner-Lce. Addis recognized (In
valuable nature of the Web site, accessi
ble from am computer in the world, and
she pushed for SLAC to make its infor
mation similarly available.
llius, working diligentk with Kun/.
computet systems specialist Cleorgc
Crane and physicist 1 onv |ohnson,
Addis coordinated the country's first
Web site of this kind in Dec. 1001.
Among other useful resources, Addis

created a Web search interface, which
she called SPIRES-HEP (for Stanford
Public Information REtrieval System-
High-Energy Physics), to further enable
access to the SLAC library particle
physics bibliographic database.
In his book, "Weaving the Web," Tim
Berners-I.ee called this accomplishment
the "killer application" that brought the
Web to the attention of the particle physics
community.
1 lowever, as v.tluable as her technolog
ical contribution was to the world, Addis s
career had several other equalK impor
tant milestones. After graduating from
Stanford with a bachelor's in international
relations, Addis began working in the li
bran .it SI AC, then-called lYoject-VL in
HHi'J. In the late lOtiOs, she was responsi
ble for the automated bibliographic con
trol at SIAC. which evolved into the
SPI RES-HEP database. Ihedatab asecin -
rently receives an average of 20.000
searches per dav.
Einallv, her innovation set the- stage for
the world's first virtual libran. In tollalx)-
ration with physicist Paul C.insparg, she
treated a Web interface to Ins online
repository of physics journal articles. I his
Web site was then linked to the records in
SPIRES-HEP, making the cud result a
large working virtual libran with Addis .it
the helm.
