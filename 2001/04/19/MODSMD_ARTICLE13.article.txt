### ERIN ARCHERD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With spring comes the Stanford Band s
selection of field-show writers and an an
nouncer for the upcoming war. 1 he new
writers, seniors Mark Canek and l anicia
Pern and freshman Una WeinlKTg, were
announced at the beginning ol tins quarter.
Stanford alumnus Mark Ruhin will return
as the announcer.
While the entiix- selection process is
cloaked in the Band's characteristic secrecv,
a campuswide |)oster campaign last quarter
did encourage all communitx members to
appl\ to l)e one of the f< nxball season's field
sliow writers.
h ( >s| Kit iw field-show writers were asked
to write and design a field show. Based on
these applications, the Band's production
team, "(iraphix,' coni[>osed of juniors |oel
knudson and And\ Rosen, selected the
three student writers for next fall.
In addition to tilling out an application,
announcer applicants also underwent a se
ries of "mind games." explained freshmen
Steve Yelderman, one of the Band's public
relations directors. "[At that |>oint. the ap
plic ant is like a| rat running through a nia/e

with electric shock."
1 he Band announcer's resjxvisibilities
include reading the field shows during f< m >t
ball games, acting as master of ceremonies
on occasions like the annual Big (lame
Week Bearial Rally and calling the Band
onto the field with thee n of, "The one. the
onlv, the truK incomparable Iceland Stan
ford J uniorl niwrsitx Marching Band."
I he pnK'ess of writing a field show iscol
lalx>rative, Ix-ginning with a xvceklx brain
storming | )i ( K'ess called Stanford Marc hing
I nit I hinkers. or SMI I'. During this ses
sion, band meinl)ers pick a theme foi Satur
day's show.
" I o get an idea of what [the unit] is like,
imagine fora moment a room full of some
of the I K'st, brightest, most creative voting
minds in the country, feeding off of each
others' wit in an effort to bring s<>phistic ated
humor and sometimes even social com
mentary to a field show ," said sophomore
Aram Cretan, another public relations di
rector. "Now imagine the opposite of that:
I hat's SMUT."
After a theme has been chosen, the task
of writing a show is turned over to writers
and "(iraphix,' who t.ike the ideas brain
stormed and create a complete field-show
script and field chart.
" I Tie writers turn our child-like scrawls
into a brilliant script whose ultimate tragic
importance may not be realized for genera
tions. and (iraphix draws little straight lines
on pieces of paper," Cretan said. "Some

times these lines arc curvy. .Ynvwavs, we
stand on those lines while the annonncei
reads the s( 1 ipt. and that's a Held show."
W hilt* the writers and annouiKci are in
tegral to the success ola field show, s|>t*cta
tors often overlook this role in the field sluÂ»w
|>ertoi main e.
I don t think the annoutu ing made an
impression on me. said freshman Michael
/akai as. I think the field shows are mh>f\.
I)nt I in not sure the writing s the most im
portant part. It's niostlx just the hand."
Also, students sometimes find the dia
logue hard to hear and hard to understand.
"112 1 lie field show's] funm, hut, if \ou
don't hear the commentary, it's not as
funny, said sophomore 1-\an Iforowit/.
"It's fun to watch, and it's cool," said
fieshman J.R. I-ang. "But sometimes it's
prett\ incomprehensible."
Although many students find the Hand's
field shows amusing, some sa\ the\ believe
that the field shows can l>e inappropriate
and supercilious.
I appreciate feeling like we're craziei
than other s< hools. I get bored with the (!al
hand. But I don't like to Ik' represented In
some of the arrogance in it. I grimat e.it the
safetv-school jokes." said sophomore loin
W hitnah, speaking aljout the differences
between the Stanford and l'("-Berkele\
bands.
"Sometimes it's funny," said sophomore
