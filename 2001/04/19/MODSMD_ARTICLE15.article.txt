### NICK GEBALLE 
I wo I'alo Alto surgeons have sued Stan
ford, claiming that Stanford Hospital
Chief of St.iff Dr. Lawrence Shuei de
famed them after tliev critici/ed two Stan
ford gynecologists accused of malpractice
and fraud. In the suit, plaintiffs l)r. loin
Margolis and Dr. Nicola Spirtos charge
that Shuer, a co-defendant with the I'ni
versitv, made false and d.imaging state
ments in a memo he sent to all medical
staff in March 2000.
Shucr's memo addressed longstanding
allegations that brothers C'.amaran and
Fan Ne/.hat performed dangerous exper
iments 011 patients, covered up the com
plications and put false data in medical

journal articles they wrote.
Spirtos and Margolis are surgeons at
the Women's Cancer Center, and both
have served on the Stanford medical
school fat ultv. I he Ne/.hat brothers are di
rectors of the Stanford Kndoscopv (-enter.
Camaran Ne/liat is a clinical professor of
obstetrics and gvnecol<>gv. and surgei \.
In the memo, Shuer responded to a
San Jose Mercurv News article th.it quoted
Margolis and Spirtos. Without mention
ing tlieni In name, Shuer wrote that the
surgeons had "suggested that Stanford
Hospital and Clinics activeb covered up
complications which [the Ne/hats]
brought into their peer review process."
I le went on to sav that, after investigat
ing these allegations thoroughlv for four

years, "we have found nothing to suggest
that such conduct has occurred."
Shuer attached to the memo a state
ment prepared foi the media. \c cording
to the statement, " I he hospital lias found
no support for the allegations [of malprac -
tice against) the Ne/hats." Mentioning
Spirtos and Margolis b\ name loi the first
time, it stated that the two "directK com
pete for patients with the Ne/hats."
Margolis and Spirtos, in their formal
complaint, said that Shucr's statements are
false. I hey said tli.it "there is . . . virtually
no economic competition between [them
selves] and the Ne/hats."
"All we asked for was an apology," Spir
tos said in an interview with the San Fran
cisco Chronicle on Monday. "But, even

though we war right, they couldn't say.
'We've mack' a mistake.' "
Debra Zumwalt. Stanford's general
counsel, is representing Dr. Shuer. She
calls the lawsuit "completely and totally
without merit."
"Nothing was said |in Shuer's tnemo|
that was untrue, [and the memo was] not
defamaloi N in any case," Zumwalt said.
She said that Spirtosand Margolis ha\ e
"operated on the same patients [as the
Ne/hats] for the same conditions. 1 he\
clearly are competitiye." And. even it that
were not true, there is "nothing rlefama
torv about saying they're competitiye."
she said.
The San Jose Mercun News reported
that Spirtos sued Stanford Medical ('enter
