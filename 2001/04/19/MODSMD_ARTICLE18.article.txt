Last November, studenl groups
went around getting the vote out
li >1 Klec tion 2000. Did .111 vbod\ re
ally care? No. l ast week, students
went around getting the vote out tor the
ASS I .iikl class president elections. No
body tared.
Feeling t heated ol the sound and tin \ ol
political passions running high, we go hunt
ing for the villain responsible for this sad
state of affairs. W hat was the cause of this
non-drama in two acts? Student apatln.
Apalhv. It's an evil von should avoid. It's

a disease that Lowell
c an't cure.
()n this campus, apa
thy's an insult of the
highest degree. ( all a
Stanford student apa
thetic, and you negate
the dynamism that lie's
tried so hard to ni|ct t
into Ins life. Apathetic
premeds don't make it

!<> medical school; vou've got to show tin
horns of community service and hospital
volunteerism. I lie undergraduate admis
sions office is Mulled lull ol ap|)li( ations
declaring that those students i are — about
politic s. povertv. oppressic>n. art. ()nee you
get in, you have but one four-vear-long
mission: I o find vour passion.
Apathy negates the entire Stanford
ideal. Just kic king back ain't gonna cut it.
\ »>u can't )iist pla\ I i isbee; vou've got to do
Ultimate. You can't |iist lie on the Oval;
you've got to read that paper on optimal
taxation theory. You can't |um watch the
game and have a Bud; vou've got to recite
the st.its and know the plavers, as well as
hold interesting discourse about the beer
making process. ("Dude, I got this totally
awesome brew kit on I . Ave. List night! So,
like, I was trvin' it out. v'know . ..") |ust
chillin' ain't a good enough answer. Voine
got to be intense.
Cotiverselv. politic,il activism is noble.
I hose folks who are bus\ synergi/ing in
an enchanted broccoli forest — what
keeps them on a horrible dorm diet of
mushv vegan gruel, dav in and dav out?
It's the knowledge that they're not apa
thetic at all. They're activists — the very
antithesis of apathy. Man does not live b\
bread alone; protest can stir the blood,
even as glucose levels drop. Protest istheii
way of life, their misoti d'etre. I hev're pas
sion.ite individuals.
