Provost Etchemendy's
explanation unsatisfying
In his recent reply to the faculty and
student letter questioning Stanford's eon
tract with Nike, Provost John
Ktchemendv wrote. "Our one and onh
interest in negotiating with \ike is to sup
port our student athletes. Without equip
ment contracts like this, the Department

ot Athletics would not be able to provide
many ot our student-athletes with uni
forms and equipment."
I am unsure of what Ktchemendy
means. 1 concede th.it, without equip
ment contracts, the ability of the depart
ment to equip its students might be hin
dered. But Ktchemendv's statement
seems to suggest that the only wav to meet
the Athletics Department s needs in to
contract with a corporation nearl\ syn
onymous with sweatshop labor in a man
ner such that Stanford athletes promote
the corporation's products.
Perhaps this realh is the dismal case;
Adidas and Reebok, the other two top
manufacturers of athletic gear, have .1 lus
ton of labor exploitation that resembles
Nike's record. But the question of
whether there is an alternative to becom
ing involved in a relationship that benefits
a company built upon abuse and exploita
tion is a question that deserves to be an
swered for the sake ot the hundreds of
thousands ot workers affected In our ac
tions. It there is no alternative, it seems
that an institution "concerned about the
working conditions at companies with
whom |it lias] .1 relationship" would use its
leverage to pressure Nike tor c lunge be
cause we have .1 contract with them. I'm
not entirelv sure how we should pressure
Nike, but 1 11 link the subject is worth con
sideration.
I should remind readers of
Ktchemendv's statement that "Nike em
ploys far more people in its monitoring
operation than am compai ableconipam.
Civen the options, we feel this is a re
spectable solution." I inav indeed have
read too tar into this statement about the
necessitv of equipment com rat ts. It's pos
sible that Kttheinenth believes Nike's
public relations campaign that the com

pany is doing its utmost to better the
working conditions in its factories.
For instance, he may believe that Nike
has raised wages (while calculating infla
tion shows th.it real wages have fallen),
that it is committed to respecting the right
of workers to associate and bargain (while
a union leader in Indonesia was recently
attacked outside the plant in which he was
employed), that it is committed to the Fair
Labor Association Code of Conduct that
promotes "the minimum wage required
l)\ local law or the prevailing industry
wage, whichever is higher."
Furthermore, a recent investigation bv
the Indonesian I'rban Community Mis
sion uncovered a two-fold breach of In
donesian law in the factory it examined in
Jakarta. I he number of hours worked ex
ceeded the legal maximum, and the over
time pay was below the legal minimum.
Bv the way, the minimum wage in In
donesia, which varies from region to re
gion, is typical!) 70 percent of the mini
mum living wage as calculated by the De
partment of I .abor.
1 lie provost may not know that half of
the directing board of the Fair Labor As
sociation is made up of executives of the
companies it is supposed to monitor. I do
not presume to speak tor Ktchemendy, of
course, nor do 1 mean to be disparaging
01 sarcastic. Specific examples of worker
abuse do not t.ill into one's lap. It may be
true, as he wrote, that, "We deal with too
main outside contractors to take on the
responsibilitN for monitoring those work
ing conditions in a meaningful way." But
we are not asking the I niversitv to sud
denly assume that responsibility. We are
asking it to assume responsibility in
one — just one — significant instance.
Furthermore, 1 tit) not feel
Ktt hemendy adequately answers the

question of why Stanford has not joined
the Worker Rights Consortium, which
monitors working conditions in the com
panies that contract with its member
schools. Granted, membership in the con
sortium would increase Stanford's re
sponsibilities: We would have to pay dues
between $1,000 and $50,000 (5 percent
or less of our $2,000,000 per year contract
with Nike), develop a code of conduct for
our licensees and require full public dis
closure of their facilities, wage levels, work
hours and other objective measures of
working conditions. But the 7b colleges
and universities that are members of the
consortium have found these obligations
manageable. The benefit of belonging to
the consortium is precisely that groups
outside Stanford will monitor working
conditions and inform us of their find
ings. That seems like a deal too good to
pass up.

I am unsure of what Ktchemendy

the corporation's products.
Perhaps this realh is the dismal case;
Adidas and Reebok, the other two top

Nike's record. But the question of
whether there is an alternative to becom

a company built upon abuse and exploita

Provost Etchemendy's
explanation unsatisfying
In his recent reply to the faculty and
student letter questioning Stanford's eon
tract with Nike, Provost John
Ktchemendv wrote. "Our one and onh
interest in negotiating with \ike is to sup
port our student athletes. Without equip
ment contracts like this, the Department

ot Athletics would not be able to provide
many ot our student-athletes with uni
forms and equipment."
I am unsure of what Ktchemendy
means. 1 concede th.it, without equip
ment contracts, the ability of the depart
ment to equip its students might be hin
dered. But Ktchemendv's statement
seems to suggest that the only wav to meet
the Athletics Department s needs in to
contract with a corporation nearl\ syn
onymous with sweatshop labor in a man
ner such that Stanford athletes promote
the corporation's products.
Perhaps this realh is the dismal case;
Adidas and Reebok, the other two top
manufacturers of athletic gear, have .1 lus
ton of labor exploitation that resembles
Nike's record. But the question of
whether there is an alternative to becom
ing involved in a relationship that benefits
a company built upon abuse and exploita
tion is a question that deserves to be an
swered for the sake ot the hundreds of
thousands ot workers affected In our ac
tions. It there is no alternative, it seems
that an institution "concerned about the
working conditions at companies with
whom |it lias] .1 relationship" would use its
leverage to pressure Nike tor c lunge be
cause we have .1 contract with them. I'm
not entirelv sure how we should pressure
Nike, but 1 11 link the subject is worth con
sideration.
I should remind readers of
Ktchemendv's statement that "Nike em
ploys far more people in its monitoring
operation than am compai ableconipam.
Civen the options, we feel this is a re
spectable solution." I inav indeed have
read too tar into this statement about the
necessitv of equipment com rat ts. It's pos
sible that Kttheinenth believes Nike's
public relations campaign that the com

pany is doing its utmost to better the
working conditions in its factories.
For instance, he may believe that Nike
has raised wages (while calculating infla
tion shows th.it real wages have fallen),
that it is committed to respecting the right
of workers to associate and bargain (while
a union leader in Indonesia was recently
attacked outside the plant in which he was
employed), that it is committed to the Fair
Labor Association Code of Conduct that
promotes "the minimum wage required
l)\ local law or the prevailing industry
wage, whichever is higher."
Furthermore, a recent investigation bv
the Indonesian I'rban Community Mis
sion uncovered a two-fold breach of In
donesian law in the factory it examined in
Jakarta. I he number of hours worked ex
ceeded the legal maximum, and the over
time pay was below the legal minimum.
Bv the way, the minimum wage in In
donesia, which varies from region to re
gion, is typical!) 70 percent of the mini
mum living wage as calculated by the De
partment of I .abor.
1 lie provost may not know that half of
the directing board of the Fair Labor As
sociation is made up of executives of the
companies it is supposed to monitor. I do
not presume to speak tor Ktchemendy, of
course, nor do 1 mean to be disparaging
01 sarcastic. Specific examples of worker
abuse do not t.ill into one's lap. It may be
true, as he wrote, that, "We deal with too
main outside contractors to take on the
responsibilitN for monitoring those work
ing conditions in a meaningful way." But
we are not asking the I niversitv to sud
denly assume that responsibility. We are
asking it to assume responsibility in
one — just one — significant instance.
Furthermore, 1 tit) not feel
Ktt hemendy adequately answers the

question of why Stanford has not joined
the Worker Rights Consortium, which
monitors working conditions in the com
panies that contract with its member
schools. Granted, membership in the con
sortium would increase Stanford's re
sponsibilities: We would have to pay dues
between $1,000 and $50,000 (5 percent
or less of our $2,000,000 per year contract
with Nike), develop a code of conduct for
our licensees and require full public dis
closure of their facilities, wage levels, work
hours and other objective measures of
working conditions. But the 7b colleges
and universities that are members of the
consortium have found these obligations
manageable. The benefit of belonging to
the consortium is precisely that groups
outside Stanford will monitor working
conditions and inform us of their find
ings. That seems like a deal too good to
pass up.

Hate crimes teach-in needs

I lie teacli-in was in response to the recent
racist graffiti discovered on tampus. and
the locus ot the night w.is formulating .1
codified response to what are being called
"hate crimes." I learned a lot about the
st.line that several people t.ikc on the
issue, and I applaud all who worked to
hold the program lot their involvement

I'm writing because I am concerned
with the wa\ that this issue is being treat

identi(\ with minorit\ groups. I know
that there are mam people ol the above
description who care deeph about the
apparent unrest on campus demon
strated b\ the recent graffiti and other
incidents. I'm not sure that the meeting
held 011 Monda\ night rellccted or al

the minorit\ point ol view b\ reminiscing

and chuckles. Second, a plea on the part
of one woman for those who are intro
ducing Founder's Day to acknowledge
Iceland Stanford's prejudiced sentiments

and to recogni/c the wa\ that this has
( hanged at Stanford, "out of 1 espet 1 to the
