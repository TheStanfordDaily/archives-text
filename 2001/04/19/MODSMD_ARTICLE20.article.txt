Hate crimes teach-in needs
to be more inclusive
1 .mended I lie emergent \ tc.it li-in
hostcil In I I ('.entro ( hit alio and run In
sevet a I student groups on \londa\ night.
I lie teacli-in was in response to the recent
racist graffiti discovered on tampus. and
the locus ot the night w.is formulating .1
codified response to what are being called
"hate crimes." I learned a lot about the
st.line that several people t.ikc on the
issue, and I applaud all who worked to
hold the program lot their involvement
.ind lor their hard work.
I'm writing because I am concerned
with the wa\ that this issue is being treat
ed with respect to those who do not
identi(\ with minorit\ groups. I know
that there are mam people ol the above
description who care deeph about the
apparent unrest on campus demon
strated b\ the recent graffiti and other
incidents. I'm not sure that the meeting
held 011 Monda\ night rellccted or al
lowed for this.
I'wo comments caught ni\ attention.
()nc. a situation m whit h President I len
ness\ was quoted as svmpathi/ing with
the minorit\ point ol view b\ reminiscing
about a time tli.it he was the onl\ white
man at an all-black engineering confer
ence. I lus comment was met with sneers
and chuckles. Second, a plea on the part
of one woman for those who are intro
ducing Founder's Day to acknowledge
Iceland Stanford's prejudiced sentiments

and to recogni/c the wa\ that this has
( hanged at Stanford, "out of 1 espet 1 to the
minority kevnote speakei." which is tin
paraphrase.
Both ol these tomments sti ink me as
missing the point. With immense respect
fbi those wlit) have lived all then li\es as
members ol groups that are targeted in
these t\pes ot crimes, it is belittling and
unproductive to dismiss the rest ol the
population simpl) because the) have not
experienced prejudice or hate first-hand.
All at knowlcdgmcnt ot 1 .eland Stanford's
unnatteptable racist views should be
made out ot respect to even student, stall
member and facult\ member at Stanford,
not |ust those belonging t<> minoritv
groups. | ust as inclusion in a minoritx
group dties nt>t necessarih dictate ac
tivism 011 that group's part, exclusion
from any minority group tloes not mean
approval 01 antipatln l<>l anv bias crime
01 other prejudice.
()ne man at the meeting expressed a
sentiment with which I wholeheartedly
agree. He said that, although he believes
that Stanford tloes a good job ol creating
communities where students ma\ devel
op within ami through their own cultures,
we need to work 011 integration between
these separate communities. In other
words, communication between groups
and cultures is lat king. I think that the at
mosphere at the meeting 011 Mondav
night was 111 part a reflection of this state
of affairs.
I know that Stanford students have it

in them to work to change this campus
loi the bettci. to make this .1 place where
ci imes ol this nature are not tolerated. A
dear objective — knowledge of current
legal standards on hate c rime (sc miething
not discussed .it Monday night's meet
ing) — and less 1 hctoric will help.

Students should not be afraid
of racist graffiti'
I.Holts to police the thoughts and
speech of Stanford students, such as the
recent !i\ stcria oyer racist graffiti, are sure
to tail. H\ reading infantile, attention-get
ting scrawls on public walls as "hate
crimes" and < (loosing it» make the graffiti
symbolic of sinistct social forces, campus
acti\ists .ind administrators elevate the
eowardh scofflaws who write the stuff to
the vaunted status of guerillas and public
enemies.
Neither the graffiti nor the impotent
t rccps \\ ho write it deserve to be taken sc
riouslv or to be given the time of day.
Strong, voting college students in the pro
cess of braveh exploring the world should
not be afraid of scabrous scribbling on
bathroom walls. Hie graffiti might be an
nexing. or even hurt your feelings it you
are a delic ate sort of person, but it will not
