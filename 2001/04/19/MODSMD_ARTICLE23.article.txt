time this season in a three-game
series.
I omorrow night, Trojan ju
nior Mark Prior looks to avenge
Ins only loss of the season against
Stanford's Jeremy Guthrie.
Guthrie threw a complete game,
six-hitter on March 9 at Sunken
Diamond to beat Prior and his
13-strikeout performance. Last
week at California, Prior struck
out 14 batters and allowed just
two hits in his second shutout of
the season. Ihe projected top
two pic kin June's amateur base -
ball draft and the best pitcher in
college baseball stands at 10-1
with a 1.21 ERA and an astound
ing 124 strikeouts in 82 2/3 in
nings pitched.
Unlike the March series at
Sunken Diamond, which ended
in a Stanford sweep of the I rojans
and vaulted the Cardinal to the
top ol the polls, the games at
Dedeaux Field this weekend will
count in the league standings.
The Cardinal clings to a two
game lead in the Pacific 10 Con
ference over I SC. and could po
tentially blow tht' conference race
wide open by duplicating its
March fiat.
However, Marquess warned
that, no matter what happens in
the battle between the league's
two best teams, Stanford still has
half its conference schedule left to
play.
"Ifyou play great this weekend
and don't play great the next
three weekends after that, it
doesn't do you am good," lit- said.
"Yeah, this weekend is big. but I'll
say the same thing next week
end."
I lie crucial Pac-10 action be
gins tomorrow night at 0 p.m.,
with a pair of 1 p.m. starts .it
Dedeaux Field on Saturda\ and
Sunday. Saturdav's game will be
televised live on Fox Sports Bav
