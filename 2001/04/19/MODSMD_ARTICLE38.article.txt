## The 						Standard 
### Josh Covington, Editorial Staff 
1 lie Standard would like ver\ much to he the next
hand in a long line of indie-rot k heavy weights coming
out ol the Pacific Northwest. I he Standard hails from
Portland. Ore., with a characteristically Northwest
sound reminiscent ol hands like Built to Spill and Mod
est Mouse. 1 his sell-titled (.1) out on Seattle-based Bar
baric Records is the hand's lirst release and it's well
worth a listen or two.

I he first tlimi; vou'll notice upon contact with this
album is tlu- distinct vocals. Vocalist lim Putnam has a
singing voice I'd label .is unique. A Iriend of mineÂ« hose the
word "annoving," but 1 don't think I want to go that tar
into the negatix it\ spec trum. II vou're turned ofl b\ lipe
( uliar strained singing voii e on the fust track, rest assured
that he tames it down a bit m the subsequent songs.
Love or bate the vocals, it's hard to discount the
strip-down rock fun or range of this band's debut
recording. I he- Standard's music ranges from the
pure no-nonsense roc k sound of bands like Roc ket
from the t a vpt to the delicate instrumentation asso
c lated with hands like Quasi.
I he most memorable (and pertinent) lvric s c onic in
track se\en. "Kxpressw.i\when the singer sa\ s,' Move
fast, move slow Ihe world is ( hanging socjuic k I put ni\
heart 011 hold Did you hear thev reinvented god? Now
inanx bought, how mam sold Did vour education get
vou electric gold Generic suits with brand name souls
Uuild and construct, till bodies with spaces Mac bines
in Love Live die, America."
fhe music is cate In, the lvrics arc insightful; this
band just might be part of .1 much needed cure for
tocl.n s sugai -pop-saturated nuisi< -industn blues.
