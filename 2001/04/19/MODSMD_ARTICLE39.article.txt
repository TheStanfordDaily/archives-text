# "Rock Action"
## Mogwai 
### Eno Sarris, Staff Writer 
Let me get something oil'in\ chest right now: lam
.1 poser. 1 know nothing about Mogwai and ver\ little
about indie rock in general, but I will still trv to tell
you something about the band's newest album, "R«u k
Action."
Alter six years and seven releases, there will be those
that have heard more of the now live-piece band than
me. bin most of us weren't hanging out in (ilusgow when
the band got going, so don't chime in with that "I've
known them since the beginning" crap. Hopeful)), let
ling you know that I am a poser earlv on will keep some

of von disgruntled indie roik savants reading. We'll
ha\ e t<> see how il goes.
For one, I tan still tell you that the first tra< k sounds
like Radiohead's "Kid A" or even like a little Aphex
I w in-plus-guitai kind of thing. And "Sine Wave is
anomalous in its electronit tendencies. However, that's
when* most analogies end, as the test ol the album is
much (loser to rock.
Mogwai has got its own thing going, and you can hear
it in tracks lour and five, "Dial: Revenge and "You
Don't know Jesus," respectively, which showtase the
band's guitar work. I he three guitarists work together
in sparing tin lists, allowing the musit to he simple but
(timplex. I liink Flaming l.ips il yon have tot ompare the
sountl to something that li.is < ome beltire.
Mogwai does its thing without too unit li in the wa\ <»t
leatl vocals It's reallv |iist part <>l the v\a\ the hand keeps
its innsii simple. Mogwai sliest ti at ks highlight its abili
t\ to mix different amounts ol each musical element
without letting am one element dominate. <>n won't be
singing one til the group's hooks fin the wa\ to t lass ,iti\
time sotin.
I hex know how to use the studio, kind 01. I he\ j»la\
arountl with the knobs and end up with hca\ \ sounding
songs like "Sine W.ave" antl "Robot C.hant." Although
these aren't the highlights ol the album, the band < onus
bat k eat h time with better trat ks that combine the studio
savoir-faire with good guitar work. ('ase in point: ('.bet k
out "2 Rights Make 1 Wrong" and "Set ret Pint.
I bis is good stiill. Realh Ihe onl\ thing I (an reall\
sa\ is that Mogwai isn't where it could be. Max be. Hut the
band is good, and I am glad I own at least one Mogwai
album. I should probabh t bet k out another, and mavbe
one with more than eight trat ks.
