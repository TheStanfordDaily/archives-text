hack one on the album, "Touch Me" In Rui I)a Silva, in
siantlv puts you in the mood for dancing. Ihe song is in
fused with funk\ lead vocals that elevate the background
tec lino beats. I nfortunateb . the rest of the album does not
live up to the standards set In " I ouch Me." I he tracks that

Now, I understand the need for seamless transitions, but
there is something wrong w hen vou < an t tell one song from

for old-school funkiness and bis respect lor techno and
house music Ihe lirst two minutes of the song sound as il an
old Parliament hook had a head-on collision with a house

II is not until track 14 that some ol the soul that inaugu
rated the album is finalb regained. "Delivei Me" is a soulful
