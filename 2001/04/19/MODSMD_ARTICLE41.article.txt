Run-D.M.C.. is dead. .iihl it has been fora while.
I he original hip-hop group, composed o! Run
(Joseph Simmons), D.M.C. (Darrvl McDaniels) and
|am Master Jav (Jason Mi/ell), broke onto the scene in
I98:i as the fust rap ensemble to conquer MTV and
earn both gold and platinum plagues. I nlortunatelv,
the band's reign ended when "Down Wit 11 The King"
was released in 199.'V
The band's newest release, "Crown Royal," is pa
thetic in contrast to its innovative work of the '80s.
which branded Rim-D M.C. the first mainstream hip
hop group. In the past, Run-D.M.C'. gained respect for
its creative flow and witty lyrics.
I he group members' talents » reated perhaps one of
the greatest hip-hop albums ever in "Raising Hell."
Kveryone Irotn hip-hop enthusiasts to glam-roc k legal
ists loved the group because it had a new. different \ ibe.
I'nfortunatelv. "Crown Royal" goes againsts even
tiling Run-D.M.('. once was. I his album lacks creativi
t\ and has a generic. yet awkward, dance sound. F.ven
song except the title track involves a guest artist. Run-
D.M.C. conforms to each guest's sound, transforming
the album into a collection of random, poorh linked
songs with weak production that does not mesh well
with the energ\ -driven lvrics of the group.
"Crown Roval" does include impressive perfor
mances from Nas, Method Man. Mobb Deep and I-at
|oe. "Queens Dav," with Nas and Mobb Deep, is one of
the feu highlights on the album. Run recites an im
pressive verse on this song: "In some cases, the onl\
thing that l.ithei and son have in common is their love
for Run been the- illest since da\ one I'm too ad

von s.ud it It's been a minute, I'm still the king ol the
woi Id, so don't forget it
1 he album is without an\ evocative content, as R u ti

hard to c onforni to the sound ol today's hip-hop st.us.
"('.rown Royal" proves that, although Run-D.M.( u.is
the- group that established hip-hop in the mainstream,
its time ended long ago. so ii should step aside and take
its place in history.
