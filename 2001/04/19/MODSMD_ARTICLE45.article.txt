ol its lovable redneck hero. I he
problem is. it's not funnx l ; ot the

However, the film has its mo
ments ol trashx brilliance. In
what ina\ prove to he the most
strangelx memorable countx lair
footage <>i the decade, Spade,
briellv emplox ed as a Ferris w heel
operator, engages ma sequence

cnmplishes something the entire
film should have done — he puts
Ins background and his < ulture
on proud displax and dares the
world to ( halienge him.
He gets closer to the gritty
heart of his character at that
moment than anywhere else
in the film. I he onlv other
"authenticity" in the movie is
provided bv the presence ol
trashv. reel neck c rooner Kid

Rock. Although his role is es
sentialK a cameo appearance,
the menacing realism ol his
snarl is a breath ol fresh air
amidst the sappv sentimental
ity and underhanded cheap
shots that dominate the rest ol
the film. All assessments of
music al talent aside, iu a world
of cartoonish caricatures. Kid
Rock blazes across the screen
and lends the film a lew pre
cious moments ol grittv and
untainted realism.
