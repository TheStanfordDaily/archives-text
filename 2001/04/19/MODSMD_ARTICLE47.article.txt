people so quickly. Rollins spoke
with sincerity and integrity. He
revealed his rich personality, his
aspirations, his fears — lit* w.is.
in short, true. I left the perfor
mance with a new-found respect
for Rollins and a curious sense
that I should strive fora higher
standard for myself — all this
from his two-and-a-half hour
siint in San Francisco.
After apologizing for missing
San Francisco on his last spoken
word tour, he said. "It's nice to
be back into a city of smog and
urban fucking sprawl!" He had
just been in Minnesota.
Rollins just turned 40 a few '
weeks ago and devoted the first
part of the show to some light-

hearted sell-pitv ahont the plight
ol the middle-aged "nervous
adult." Fortv-year-olds, Rollins
noted, don't evei look » 00l when

in the crowd" that were lurried
on by the entiling and scan
dalous e-mails advertising "bare

1 K-years-and-t wo-seconds-old."
Rollins continued with a po

bivalence toward Al Gore and
George YV., his support for Don

viable and plausible sober ideals
and aspirations. He rattled oil
Ins loathing for I A. drivers,
men's obsession with Home

seven-day plan fora hypotheti

He spoke about Jesus Ghrisl.
who he figured would be some
"stinking vegan motherfucker"
in today's culture. But he fin
ished with some talk on Jesus with
an optimistic note, wondering il
Jesus ever got "time out" to take a
