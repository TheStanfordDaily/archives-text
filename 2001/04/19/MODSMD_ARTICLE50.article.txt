# Another 'Saturday Night' and I ain't got no fashion sense
## 
### HILARY BIENSTOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During the year I was horn, men strutted the street
wearing white polyester suits with long, starched c ollars.
I hev sported patterned polyester shirts unbuttoned to
the navel and platform hoots. Women wore high heels
and glitter and did their hair in Fan ah Fawcett wings.
I he year was 1978, and everyone wanted to be John
I ravolta, dancing the night awa\ on a lit-up disco floor.
Fhe movie, ot course, was "Saturday Night Fever."

"Saturday Night
Fever" is back as a
Broadway musical now.
I oda\ polyester may be
out and Afros have gone
the wav ol hoop skirts
and bustles, but "Satur
day Night Fever" still
encapsulates an era.
I i ue. it may be Jacking a
meaningful plot and it
may lack the topical ap
peal it held 20 years ago.
But it's still a great show,
the kind that makes you
want to dance in the
aisles even before the
<-iid of the overture. In
side the ()rpheiim I he
ater in San Francisco, on
I uesda\ through Sun
da\ nights, disco is still
king.
Fhe story is simple
and formulaic - almost
ludicrously so. Bv day,
I'onv Manero is an une
ducated kid from
Bi ookl\ n. living with his
familv and working at
the neighborhood paint
store. B\ night, he puts
on his boogie shoes and
becomes the hottest
item on the dance floor
at the local disco.

When the M( announces a
dance content with a monetar\
prize. 1 on\ shuns his long-time ad
mirer, Annette, and instead asks
Stephanie, a sophisticated Manhat
tan beautv, to the dance. ()t c ourse,
loin and Stephanie win the dance
contest.
Throughout the show, the
sparse dramatic scenes are over
shadowed bv .1 few heartfelt ballads
... ,1 i:.

and dynamite
dam e numbers ga
lore. I he big musi
cal numbers were,
of course, what
brought down the
house. Highlights
included the open
ing number to the
Bee (iee's "Sta\ ing
Alive," which con
vinced us that

I'onv is, indeed, (he kill ol the dance
floor. Later on, the audience was
thrilled with several other large ensem
ble numbers, including loin's gang ot
friends danc ing to "Boogie Shoes" and
"Disco Inferno" at the night club and
the climactic dance contest scene.
In particular, Stacey Martin
and Aubre\ Smith - the black couple
competing for the prize - were wild, en
ergetic and a thrill to watch, hamming it
up and commanding attention for .ill
the\ were worth. Of course, I on\ and
Stephanie (Richard II Blake and lea
nine Mevers) also put on .1 good show,
but their moves seemed a bit uninter
esting. and less spirited. But these en
semble numbers and duets had no low
point: From beginning to end, the\
were flashy, filled with tec hnic alb d.iz
zling choreography and the right kind
ot attitude to pull it oft.
Ballads were another maiustax
of the evening. Jim Ambler as Bobb\

(i..and especialh Aileen Quinn .is Annette, both deliv
ered strong performances, making their songs seem
emotionalh compelling (no small feat, given the two-di
mensional nature of the characters). But other ballads
siniph blended into the rest ot the meager plot and
could have been left out of the show altogether. In gen
eral, the slow songs disappeared into the minimal dra
matic scenes; both could have been eliminated without
diminishing the qualit) ol the musical.
Although billed as a musical, it seemed like the stage
production ol "Saturdav Night Fever" should have been
a musical review. Dance numbers, elaborate and effec
tive stage sets and outlandish costumes were all elFec
tiveh highlighted during the do/en or so energetic and
skilllulh performed dance numbers.
fhe score, composed primarily ol songs b\ the Bee
(iees, perfecth fit the spirited, carefree mood. ()nlv the
forgettable storvline and ballads put a damper on
things C.o see the show, don't think too hard about the
plot, and In the end ol the evening vou'll be wishing you
could wear polyester, boogie to the Bee C.ees and live
the dream of "Saturday Night Fever."
