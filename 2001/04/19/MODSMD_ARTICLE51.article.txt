is act ented b\ the lui nilure's
deep hues ,md lighting; the din
ing room is small enough so that
even table has a view but large
enough lo maintain intimai \.
As we enjoved the views, wait

For the main
(oursc, m\ Iriend or
dei-ed the seared ahi

tuna with banana turn sauce,
with sides of shrimp risotto and
bab\ bok i ho\. I he tood looked
like a work of art. complete with
bright colors and a three-dimen
sional striu i lire.
I he dish, a mix ol eastern cui
sine and western imagination,
evoki d a sin pi isingh fresh set ol
flavors. \f\ Iriend especialh en
joved the banana turn *auce,
which s|h- had never heard <>| or
imagined. I he tuna was seared

rare, providing a texture ol raw
and cooked tuna in one bite.
I ordered the two-way duck
ling. a generous portion ol grilled
duck, dink leg con lit and foie
gras croutons, lush and rich, the
duck dish was incredibh tilling
and s.itishing.
For dessert, we tried the
(•rand Marnier souffle with
i lux olate sain e, whit h was .1 pel -
let 1 ( omhination ol lightness and
weight. 1 he soullle was light and
llulK with crisp edges, but the
icing on the take was the thoio
late sauce, rit li hut light enough
tt> drink.
We were so impressed with
our dishes that we wanted to
meet the chef. Seiji \Vakaba\ashi,
w hose ( ulinai \ delights blend his
experience in Japanese, French
and ( all for ni. 1 n cuisine.
\\ e would love I" become regu

budgets that will not happen am
time 111 the ne\t decade. Outline's
ambiance and food tome with a
helt\ prite tag, sn reserve the

But I promise vou, once vou ti 11 11
