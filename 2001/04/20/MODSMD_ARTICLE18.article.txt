In ni\ experience with Admit Week

and as a room host this vear 1 under
stand that this is the I niversit\ s oppor
tune to put its best foot forward.
Vt I in it Weekend: I lie lie begins,"
one of 11i \ tlot inmates so elegantb put it
.it lunch one tl.iv, as house hosts began
to make elaborate preparations for the
upcoming weekend <>i endless parties
and sot i.il events — which is obvioush a
far crv from the truth here at Stanford.
All this is done with the hope that new
admits will become as subdued as I was In
the Lit k of academic stutlx ing, over-abun
dance of parties and the prevalent cama
raderie amongst tlorm communities.
However, in under'represented minori
ty communities, .i different sentiment ex
ists. While there are those who look for
ward to Admit Weekend for the sot ial im
plications, mam feel .i personal obligation
to impress minorit> prospective freshmen.
In the blat k comtnunit\. for example,
preparations for Admit Weekend have
been going on for months. I lie Black
Recruitment Orientation Committee
has been working diligenth to make
sure that events within the blat k com
munitv (specifitalh I jamaa) go as
smoothly as possible. For the recruit

inent organization and the hl.u k colu
mn 11 it v. \c 1111 it \\ eekend is sei t< >11 s busi
ness. Ihe mission: Impress .is mam of
ill.ll 11.7 percent as possible, comince
them that Stanford s hl.u k coin 111 ii nit \ is
amazing and that, consequently. Stan
ford is the best place f<>i them to he (hot h

With that s.iul. will recent events
detei minorities from enrolling at Stan
ford? Is it important that admits learn
about the recent hate graffiti on cam
pus.' In retrospect. ni\ real disappoint
ment with m\ own \dinit Weekend ex
perience was that I wasn't exposed
enough to "real" college life. Sure. I
plaved cards with ni\ future cJassniates.
took a tour of the campus and e\ en sat in
on a 1 lass, but the niajoril\ of the week
end w.is spent at various parlies.
But we have to he honest with these
new students. We have to prepare lliein
foi what thc\ re walking into. Mavhe
these latest r.u ial issues will cease. Mavhe
1 hex re isolated incidents. Hul pist in case
ihev're not, ininorit\ adinils need to
know that Stanford is not perfect, li h.is
problems. What we need to do is tell the
adinils how important the\ are to us
how integral their future existence at
Stanford is to the light against r.u ism.
Prospective freshmen should know
that Stanford is currentb .11 odds with it
self. Hopefulh students won't stop all
race dialogues for the weekend. I hc\
need to continue. And while I under
stand that \cltnii Weekend is a time for
Stanford to show Us best through elabo
rate activities, heautifulb erected bal
loon arches and humorous presenta
tions. admits need to know that this
doesn't happen even da\ —thai these
decorations serve to cover up a lot of
other negative things.
I urge room hosts to inform their stu
dents of what it is realb like to be a Stan
lord freshman. I'm sure vou'll go to
great lengths in telling them about the
social inadequacies of the campus, the
lac k of dating, the sometimes mundane
part\ scene. And vou'll even rationalize
those inadequacies with the idea that this
is an amazing school, challenged aca
deimcalh by few.
but will vou take a few seconds to tell
them about that uglv side of Stanford —
that side- which you yourself don't waul
to ac knowledge .is an indicative trait of
this heralded institution?
