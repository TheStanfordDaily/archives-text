Student clears up flag confusion
I he headline "Mississippi keeps stars

Ihe Si.us .uid B.us is the name of the
fiisi national flag of the ('.onfedeiale
Stales of \niei ka. It has seven stars in .1
cirde 011 .1 blue field in the upper left
li.uul cornel of the flag and three hori
zontal alternating red. white and red bars
(thick stripes) on the rest of the flag. As
such, ii he.us little resemblance to the

battle flag w hie Ii is incorporated in Mis
sissippi's slate flag.
As Southerners continue to define and
debate then relationship with the past, it is
important to remain educated about the
distinctions between various symbols in
Southern culture. I lopefullv. being (lear

disappointed by loss of Moosa
I .1111 writing in response to ilu- April

lami( sinclics") lamenting the departure
(»l Islauiit studies visiting Prof. Fbrahini
Moosa. I lie Department ol Religions
Studies shares the disappointment ex
pressed in both the article and editoi ial
at the loss ol this line s( holar and (licr
islied (olleague, as well .is the larger con
cern that tlu- I nivcrsitv lias do perma
nent faculty billet in Islam.
Religions Studies has tor some time
been working activeU with the adminis
tration and the Development Office to
make possible the establishment of an ls
lamic studies billet and lias identified this
.is its first prioritx in the provost's c nrrent
needs-assessment process. I ntil the billet
is established, the department remains
committed to maintaining .i \ isiting posi
tion m Islamic studies and. indeed, is now
seeking .i c andidate for next Near.
I was Hindi heartened b\ I'he Daily's
expression of concern that Islam be rep
resented at Stanford and encourage all
those who share this concern to join with
Religions Studies id the effort to develop
the I Diversity's resources in this field.
We owe no less to Moosa for all he has
given lis din ing his brief stav at Stanford.

Students should respect statues
near Mausoleum
Ingratitude is pel haps the least attr.u -
live characteristic of the human condi
tion. Most of us have felt it. We have
done oni best to help < ol leagues and stu
dents. hui ,i f</\\ o| those we have helped
most are the least appreciative, llie

I ntil .i \ear or two ago, their mau
soleum was neglected and vandali/cd.
I he nearb\ angel ol grief looked as
though the grief were the result of this
\andalism. It suffered the same fate, one
of its arms having been stolen, perhaps
as a student prank. I he statu.in group
of the Stanfords was removed from its
place ol honor and dumped in an out
dooi storage area with othei |unk. \p
parcnth it was considered offensive be
cause |ane Stanford was looking ador
ing!) at her husband, which no good
feminist would do. Following a cam
paign In us politicalb incorrect, the
Mausoleum was restored and the statu
ar\ group placed nearby .
1 he grieving angel was still grie\ing
over its condition. Now. however, thanks
to two good souls. K.uilities Operations
Managci ( liris ('.ln istoflcrson and ( ani
pns Archaeologist Laura |ones. the angel
has been restored to pristine condition.
I he problem now is to protcc t the whole
area from vandalism and to ensure the
rcspcct wliic hit deserves. I have mixed
feelings about students and unmixed
distaste for I lallowecn. a "trie k-or-treat"
celebration whit h desecrates one of the
most sacred religious feasts in the vcar.
Fast year, the students celebrated n at
the Stanford Mausoleum in sue li a rowch
wa\ that people living a long wav awa\
complained about the noise, and the po-

Lite- were limed to intervene.
lliis Halloween we must do better.
IVrhaps the Mausoleum area should he
fenced in and the gate locked on Hal
loween. At least the I niversit\ and The
Daih eould appeal to the students to take
theii reveli ies elsewhere and toallow the
Stanlot (Is to rest in peace.

The Band speaks up
I .1111 writing \ou to intbrm vou that
the situation has become ver\ grave tor
these most despicable (■arthigians. I he
mere fact ol then existence lias insulted
the illustrious Roman Knipire long
enough: Soon the\ shall meet their bittei
end. Rome will surelv ride to glory on
Frida\ 's battle.
I he great beai of Rome growls
thirst\ lor the blood ol warriors. She
refuses to linger unfulfilled; her only
sat isl at t ion is Carthage's une(]iiivocal
destruction.
Do vou hear that noise? That's the
sound ol (.arthages wench-like soldiers
fleeing to the Foothills, knowing full well
that the\ cannot escape the might\ hand
ol Rome, but hoping to extend their mis
erable existence until thev are hunted
like doves and torn like dogs.
Devastation awaits the most detestable
of cities, and ravaged it shall be. Any wise
Carthigian (sit ] should make haste and
prepare for Ins certain end. On Friday,
the mightv hand of Rome shall eradicate
the ( arthiginous cancer once and for all.
