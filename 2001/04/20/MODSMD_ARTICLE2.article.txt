### ANDREW SHIN 
This Sunday will mark the
110 th Founder's Day.a commem
oration of the University's
founder, 1-eland Stanford, and the
history of the I niversitv's found
ing. In the early years of the I ni
vcrsitv, the event was said to he
one of the biggest occasions on
even student's calendar and gen
erated considerable excitement
and widespread student part it ipa
tion. Subsequent decades have
seen this enthusiasm tlet line, how
ever — a trend that the I nivcrsit\
has taken great strides to ret tif\ in
recent years.
I his year's event is being
planned by Dean of Students Man
Wais and members of Ins staff,
which includes student represen
tatives from each class. A promo
tional effort has also been made,
including e-mails, flyers, a letter

from I niversit\ President John
Hennessv. a banner in White
Pla/a, announcements at house
meetings and a Web site dedicated
to the occasion.
Asketl whether thev thought
there was a decline in student
knowledge of and participation in
the event, those who remember
Stanford long ago said that thev
have seen a definite increase in
student interest. Margaret Kim
ball, the Universit\ archivist, said
that, compared with her time at
Stanford, interest lias increased
considerable "1 was an under
graduate at Stanford and have no
recollection of Founder's Day
when I was here," Kimball said.
"Now, even if thev don't attend,
mam more students are aware of
the celebration."
