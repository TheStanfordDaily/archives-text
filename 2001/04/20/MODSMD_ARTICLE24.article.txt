### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
W inning ilu- Pacifit 10 ('.onferent e (.hanipionship
for anv sport would seem like* an accomplishment
worth celebrating. But it is just one step for the Stan
lord men s tennis team as it defends the national
(hanipionship.
With its win over \ri/ona List Saturday, the No. 5
Cardinal (19-1. 7-0 l\u-10) captured its fifth straight
conference title. I lie team has become so dominant
that the title might as well he handed over to them at
the beginning of even season.
Hut under the tutelage of head coat h Dick Could,
who just surpassed tennis coaching legend I )an Mag
ill in the career-win column at 707. the team has been
known over the \eai s fbi its exception.il niodest\ and
strong work ethic.
Although the conference t rown is already safely in
the ( animal's hands. (Jould and the team more than
realize that their \o. I goal — repeating as NCAA
champions — has not \ct been act oniplishetl.
For am other team, winning the conference title
might prtKluce .i feeling of cotnplat cut \ .but with No.
IS Southern California (I.'Mi, 3-4) and No. 1 I CLA
(19-1, (>-1) coming into town totlav and tomorrow,
Stanford hopes to finish the regular season with an
exclamation point.
"The schedule is tough, but it get* us ready for
what we will be fat ing at NCAAs." junior K.J. llip
pensteel said. "These kinds of matches rather than
walkovers are nitu h better for us because we want to
beat the best."
Sophomore David Martin agreed that, although
the team's schedule ends on a very difficult note, the
matches will be essential in preparing the squad for
the championships.
"W'e are preparing for this time of year to peak,
and I CIA and I 'SC. will be a great test going into the
tournament, he said.
Although both the Hruins and Trojans are l\tt-10
opponents, these last two matt lies of the vear will not
count towards the teams l'ac-10 records. However,
the matches will serve as a fairly accurate gauge of
where the three teams, all contenders for the nation
al title, stand in relation to one another.
Tomorrow, the 1 rojans look to pull of 1 the upset
against the Cardinal, who defeated I S(, earlier last
month. 4-2. In order for the 1 rojans to have a chance
at the upset, tliev must jump on the (.ardinal early In
capturing the crucial doubles point, where they hold
the nation s No. 9doubles team with Ryan Moore and
Nick Rainev.

1 lie Trojans will have a much bat tler time match
ing up with the ('.ardinal at singles pla\. bet .uise Stan
ford has four nationally ranked plavers, compared
with I S( ,'s two.
The matchup at No. I singles should be hotlv con
tested as No. 1 ranked senior Alex Kirn (21 -2) w ill fat e
Mill-ranked Andrew Park (28-6).
After the I LS('. matt h, the ( ardinal will conclude its
dual-match season with a ninth anticipated home
matcli against the top-ranked Hruins. I lie two men's
collegiate tennis I nans have split their two meetings
so far this year. Each handed the other its onl\ loss of
the year.
UCLA defeated Stanford in the finals of the
National Team Indoors Championship in mitl-
Fcbruarv, 4-2, on the strength of its singles play.
The Cardinal returned the favor in Pat-10 pla\
when it defeated the Hruins in Los Angeles, 4-.S,
on April 6.
Stanford will have its hands lull, as I CIA will
bring in a nation-high six ranked singles players.
