Students protested in front of Old Union yesterday against the possible merg
er of the language departments and the recent rash of hate crimes.
tinn from .1 reluctant administra

University investments in
apartheid South Africa, the cre
ation of a Comparative Studies in

" The University must value di
versity, not just in the student
bodv, but also in the faculty and
staff I lie factiltv must be at least
as diverse as the student bodv. If
the students unite, the I niversitv
will follow. Only with students in
volvement will these changes
happen," Hamako said.
With regard to hate crimes,
Sarah Monroy, .1 senior majoring
in Comparative Rat e and Ethnic
ity, said Stanford needed a better
protocol for dealing with racist

and discriminatory offenses.
"Currently, they do it on a case
bv-case basis, and we'd like to see
a more explicit guide. We need it
for our own safety."
On the merger, junior Rohan
Radhakrislma said tli.it, "if the
merger goes through, individual
departments will lose their focus
and also their spet ialness and in
timacy." He acided, "You don't
sfK k history and political science
together 111 one department just
because they cover common
ground."
" The University has a liistorv
of not being responsive, and this
is an extreme. but not isolated,
example of this problem. We
want [the administration] to ic
spect student voice," s.iid junior
Andrew McDonald.
rhe protesters also t ailed for .1
biweekly release detailing any
hate crimes that had transpired
since the last distribution and
suggested a cultural education
component of residential life.

A coalition ol graduate and
undergraduate students staged a

three recent campus issues: the
tentative merger of language and
literature departments into one,
alleged underlunding ol coinniu

response to a recent series ol hate
crimes on campus.
1 he protest, organized In the
Humanities Kducation Action

issue ol tolerance and encourage
ment ol diversity on campus, in
addition to specific administra
tive issues like the merger, which
was considered vc\sterda\ in the
Faculty Senate.
Dressed < olorfullv and lu>ld

uted pamphlets and petitions
and addressed the crowd over a
megaphone amidst ( heers and
an a cappella performance by
Talisman.
"We need to stop hate crimes
and the merger, which show a lac k

intellectual diversity." said doctor
al candidate Marisol Negron over
the megaphone. "We need to stop
the administration from making
top-down administrative deci
sions without the input of the stu

Students protested in front of Old Union yesterday against the possible merg

tinn from .1 reluctant administra
tion, such as the protests against
University investments in
apartheid South Africa, the cre
ation of a Comparative Studies in
Rate <ind Kthnicitv department
and, most reccntlv, tlie rally
against incinerating biological
waste from the Stanford Medical
('.enter.
" The University must value di
versity, not just in the student
bodv, but also in the faculty and
staff I lie factiltv must be at least
as diverse as the student bodv. If
the students unite, the I niversitv
will follow. Only with students in
volvement will these changes
happen," Hamako said.
With regard to hate crimes,
Sarah Monroy, .1 senior majoring
in Comparative Rat e and Ethnic
ity, said Stanford needed a better
protocol for dealing with racist

and discriminatory offenses.
"Currently, they do it on a case
bv-case basis, and we'd like to see
a more explicit guide. We need it
for our own safety."
On the merger, junior Rohan
Radhakrislma said tli.it, "if the
merger goes through, individual
departments will lose their focus
and also their spet ialness and in
timacy." He acided, "You don't
sfK k history and political science
together 111 one department just
because they cover common
ground."
" The University has a liistorv
of not being responsive, and this
is an extreme. but not isolated,
example of this problem. We
want [the administration] to ic
spect student voice," s.iid junior
Andrew McDonald.
rhe protesters also t ailed for .1
biweekly release detailing any
hate crimes that had transpired
since the last distribution and
suggested a cultural education
component of residential life.
