back (lips lioin populai American movies .in<l telexi
sion shows in winch Asian and Asian-American
women wei e depicted, particularly as lovers and part

State I nivcrsitv. Shinagawa and I'ang opened the

" I he idea that racism c an taint our idea of love and
beauty is powerful," s.iid Austin ('.hang, a senior and
originatoi ol Wednesday s event.
I he event conies just weeks after hate speech tar
geting Asian women, among others, was discovered
in several (ampus locations.
A( ( oi dmg to ('.hang, the timing was unintentional,
but it ma\ have helped spin turnout. I le, along with
Kim Singh, directoi of the Asian Ainci ican Public Pol
icy Institute, organized the event several weeks ago
with help from student coordinators Owen Li and
Jane I hi. both sophomores.
"In light of the itifiit rash of
hate ( rimes on c ampus, it is more
important now than ever to recog
nize the origins of Asian-Anieric an
male ami female stereot\pes to ex
amine the machines ot cultural
production that promote and per
petuate the ( ulture ot iac ism, and
to deconstruct and obstruct these
mechanisms before the\ are inter
nalized into racial hatred and sell
hatted. I i said during opening
remai ks \\ ednesda\ night.
Several topics came up during
the disc ussion. from interiat i.il ie
latioushipsand political issues that
can mobilize the Asian-American
community to the l.u k of .111 out
spoken demagogue Mich as Jesse
Jackson for Asian Americans.
Pang, whose dissertation le
search fcK'iised on interracial rela
tionships and marriages. relaved
some of her findings to the audi
ence last night.
According to her stuck, among
all interracial relationships be
tween Asians and whites, the ratio
of Asian women married to white
men is am where between 'J to I
and 10 to I.
I'ang and Shinagawa sa\ this
bias is reflected in the two meta
narratives currcntK circulating 111
the I nited States.
One metanarrative is captured
b\ Puccini's "Madame Butterfh,"
111 which a |apanese woman shows
endless devotion to her American
husband.
I he ot her is c apt tired in
Rodgers & H.unmerstein's "The
King and I. which depicts and in
terrupts romance between an
Asian man and a white woman
that nevei c ulminates with even a

kiss. Modern representations of
the latter metanarrative are also
seen 111 "Romeo Must Die." re
leased last vear, and "Anna and
the King." from l!H)(l.
Who has the powei to create
and then to tight stereoh|>es?"
Pang asked, soniew hat 1 hetoi u all\.
at one point during the disi ussion.

1 ac ialized sexual images .11 e ongo
ing both at personal and larger
levels. However, steieotvpes have
been a pel \asive. diilic ult cultural
hurdle with regard to \sian-
Anierican einpowrrment. the
speakei s said.
Shinagawa in alls the ditlic nit\
he has had combating the stereo
type that Asian men are abusive
husbands, even with his own wife.
In spite of Ins own non-abusive ex
ample, Ills wife- still ( asualh uses
the tei 111 "abusive \sian husband"
as if it were not a stereot\pc.
" I o make the .11 gunient that

" I hat's what burns me up."
\\ itli regard to images of Asians
and Asian-Ainei ic ans 111 the media.
Shinagawa said he believes the es
