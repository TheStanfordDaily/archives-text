who have lead the debate over
the Second Amendment,"
Rakove said.
"Anvbody who's interested in
the issue of firearms regulation"
should attend, he said. Rakove
emphasized that he wanted "to
avoid a scholarlx format, not to
have a stulfv academic confer

and no paper presentations.

lv. spirited, focused and polite ex
changes about what is a < barged
issue."
