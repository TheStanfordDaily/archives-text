On campuses
like Stanford,
one out of four stu
dents have smoked tobacco
within the last year. Many use
it infrequently; 10% to 15% use
it regularly. Students say they
smoke because it increases
alertness, relieves stress and
boredom, and gives them a
feeling of ease and a sense of
belonging to some social circles.
An Addictive Drug
Tobacco - a strong poison - is
the most addictive of all drugs.
The nicotine in it stimulates the
same areas of the brain as
cocaine and amphetamines,
and tolerance to nicotine
develops faster than to cocaine
or heroin. Neurochemically, the
body adapts to the toxins in
tobacco a few hours after
smoking. Soon smoking
becomes necessary to feel
The typical smoker begins by
smoking occasionally. As
tolerance increases, smoking
becomes a habit - one which
develops into a powerful
physiological and psychological
addiction. This addiction leads
to prolonged use, putting
smokers at high risk for serious
medical consequences.
Effects of Tobacco
Tobacco is a nervous system

stimulant that triggers complex
biochemical and neuro
transmitter disruptions. It
elevates heart rate and blood
pressure, constricts blood
vessels, irritates lung tissue, and
deadens taste and smell.
Prolonged smoking is respon
sible for one out of five deaths
each year. It can cause lung
cancer, emphysema, heart attacks
and strokes. Chewing tobacco
can cause esophageal and oral
cancer.
Smoking gives you bad breath,
makes your clothes smell, and
is expensive (cigarettes average
$2.25 a pack). And because
smoking is banned from cam
pus buildings, smokers often
feel isolated while smoking
outdoors.
Second Hand Smoke
Tobacco smoke is a serious
threat to the health of non
smokers. Smoke in the air from
others' cigarettes contains toxic
chemicals including tar, nicotine,
carbon monoxide, arsenic and
cyanide. Non
Mtiokers who
breathe it absorb
these substances, and are
at tor the same serious
health consequences as smokers.
Quitting
The difficulty of quitting
smoking proves how extremely
addictive nicotine i>. But fortu
nately, most withdrawal symp
toms disappear and the body
begins repairing itself within
two weeks of quitting. There
are now promising new ther
apies (including drug and
behavioral therapies and nico
tine replacement) to support
those who want to quit.
Because tobacco is so addic
tive, we urge you not to start
to smoke. If you don't start,
then you won't have to quit. If
you smoke already, quitting is
the single most important step
you can take to enhance the
quality and length of your life.
For help, see your Cowell
practitioner to discuss the
alternatives.
