# PREVENTABLE ACCIDENTS FRUSTRATE DOCTORS
## Biking and Jogging Injuries Raise Concern at Hospital 
### JONATHAN OLSEN 
The number of student injuries re
sulting from preventable bike acc.-
dents has reached an appalling level,
according to Dr. David Gregg, director
of the Trauma Depart ment at Stanford
Medical Center Doctors are frustrated
because of the high number of easily
preventable bike accidents on cam
pus, he said.
The safety of bikers and joggers has
become the focus of attention for many
at the Stanford Medical Center, espe
cially after the tragic death of sopho
more Brianna Germer, who was
struck and killed by a minivan sever
al weeks ago.
The incident occurred directly in
front of the Stanford Medical Center.
Though many of her classmates were
shocked, Gregg said that few students
have taken her death as a sign of "the
inherent danger in the way the campus
is laid out" for biking and jogging.
"The Stanford campus is spread out
with mixed use of the property among
bikers, pedestrians and automobiles,"
Gregg said. "It's not obvious when you
are in a pedestrian or street area, and
there are not barricades. Most
times, the cars are not even
speeding when accidents involv
ing bikes and cars occur."
What is most frustrating to doctors
is the preventability of many of the
biker injuries they see, Gregg said.
"When injured bikers come to us, there
is almost always a significant head in
jury if he or she was not wearing a hel
met. The seriousness ranges from
minor head trauma to death."
In the year 2000 alone, 130 car
against-pedestrian cases were admit
ted with significant injuries. Of these,
about 15 cases resulted in the death of
the biker. From these data, at least one
person every two or three days is hit by
an automobile on campus and hospital
ized for it. And 10 percent of these
cases are fatal.
The Medical Center has also hospi
talized 85 solo bike accident patients.
Of these, five have resulted in death.
Bike on bike accidents are even more
common.
"Patients are almost always not
wearing helmets In cases of head trau
ma, we hospitalize people to watch for
severe and life-threatening head in
juries," Gregg said.
"Bike riders should at least wear
helmets and reflectors. Even though
the campus culture is opposed to wear
ing helmets, this is crazy. Our stu
dents are the pride of the nation,"
Gregg said. "Joggers should realize
that wearing earphones dangerously
impairs one of your senses and makes
you give up a survival advantage.
There are also many jogging trails be
sides street routes. The point needs to
be made that your SATs won't protect
you. Be aware of the dangers and bike
and jog safely."
One junior, who wished to remain
anonymous, said that although her
bike use is limited to riding to class
evervdav, she had been in three bike
