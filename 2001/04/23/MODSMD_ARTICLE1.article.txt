# PREVENTABLE ACCIDENTS FRUSTRATE DOCTORS
## Biking and Jogging Injuries Raise Concern at Hospital 
### JONATHAN OLSEN 
The number of student injuries re
sulting from preventable bike acc.-
dents has reached an appalling level,
according to Dr. David Gregg, director
of the Trauma Depart ment at Stanford
Medical Center Doctors are frustrated
because of the high number of easily
preventable bike accidents on cam
pus, he said.
The safety of bikers and joggers has
become the focus of attention for many
at the Stanford Medical Center, espe
cially after the tragic death of sopho
more Brianna Germer, who was
struck and killed by a minivan sever
al weeks ago.
The incident occurred directly in
front of the Stanford Medical Center.
Though many of her classmates were
shocked, Gregg said that few students
have taken her death as a sign of "the
inherent danger in the way the campus
is laid out" for biking and jogging.
"The Stanford campus is spread out
with mixed use of the property among
bikers, pedestrians and automobiles,"
Gregg said. "It's not obvious when you
are in a pedestrian or street area, and
there are not barricades. Most
times, the cars are not even
speeding when accidents involv
ing bikes and cars occur."
What is most frustrating to doctors
is the preventability of many of the
biker injuries they see, Gregg said.
"When injured bikers come to us, there
is almost always a significant head in
jury if he or she was not wearing a hel
met. The seriousness ranges from
minor head trauma to death."
In the year 2000 alone, 130 car
against-pedestrian cases were admit
ted with significant injuries. Of these,
about 15 cases resulted in the death of
the biker. From these data, at least one
person every two or three days is hit by
an automobile on campus and hospital
ized for it. And 10 percent of these
cases are fatal.
The Medical Center has also hospi
talized 85 solo bike accident patients.
Of these, five have resulted in death.
Bike on bike accidents are even more
common.
"Patients are almost always not
wearing helmets In cases of head trau
ma, we hospitalize people to watch for
severe and life-threatening head in
juries," Gregg said.
"Bike riders should at least wear
helmets and reflectors. Even though
the campus culture is opposed to wear
ing helmets, this is crazy. Our stu
dents are the pride of the nation,"
Gregg said. "Joggers should realize
that wearing earphones dangerously
impairs one of your senses and makes
you give up a survival advantage.
There are also many jogging trails be
sides street routes. The point needs to
be made that your SATs won't protect
you. Be aware of the dangers and bike
and jog safely."
One junior, who wished to remain
anonymous, said that although her
bike use is limited to riding to class
evervdav, she had been in three bike
accidents over the past three years.
Only one accident was with another
hike; the other two involved collisions
with automobiles.
"Just this year, 1 was hit by a car
that ran that ran through a stop sign in
front of Arrillaga Sports Center," she
said. "Everyone is at fault. Bikers
don't stop, and the cars aren't really
paying attention."
She said she had never known any
one to be even hospitalized because of a
bike accident, but said, "If they publi
cized the deaths resulting from acci
dents. people would he more cautious."
However, she still said, "I wouldn't
like it if bike helmets were re
quired. I don't wear a helmet. I
think it's pretty safe."
Though Germer's death came as a
shock to the campus, students are
still unwilling to recognize the risk of
being involved in at least one, if not
several bike accidents some time

while at Stanford.
New campus rules most likely
will not be implemented because,
Gregg said, "you can't legislate com
mon sense." He continued, "It only
takes one incident, and your life is
over. My best friend died while he
was biking with me because he
wasn't wearing a helmet and hit his
head on a mailbox when he fell. Had
he been wearing a helmet, it would
have been nothing."
Gregg advocated a grassroots sys
tem of change. "A cultural change
must happen, and we have to raise
people's awareness. Also, someone
ought to yell at you to wear a hel
met," he said.
"The doctors at Stanford Medical
Center are all extremely frustrated. We
would like not to have to deal with
young people losing their abilities, in
tellect and live 9 over something so stu
pid and preventable. It is emotionally
devastating for all of us," Gregg said.
"Be aware of the danger and re
spond appropriately. There are cars
that just can't see you."
