On April 23, l{)t>s, l'he Dailv printed an article

"Dismissal or suspension of four Lniversitx of
(alifornia students for flaunting .111 obscene four-let
ter word on campus prompted a protest rall\ Linn s

" Phe developments marked a new c risis 111 a dis
pute over whether tree speech is infringed l>v ban
ning public use of an obscene four-letter word.
" ' I oda\ is the beginning of a new and larger stu

said Michael Lei net , an er<>n<unit s graduate student.
"Last December, campus turmoil over free

demonstrators, main of whom had to be dragged
out of Sproul I bill, the administration building."
Bottom line: UC-Berkeley students could learn from Stanford
protesters about how to make a point without being arrested.
