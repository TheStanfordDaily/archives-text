At the White I Ma/a protest, about 200 students
gathered to discuss the I 'niversitv s refusal to
disclose the content of the recent hate crimes,
the propscd merger and the underfunding ol
campus communitx centers. Later that after

department merger. I he numbers alone show
that Stanford students are passionate and proai

feet school, but that students have strong voices
and aren't afraid or unable to appeal to the I Jni
versitv. Admits witnessed first hand that Stanford
students, far from being laid-back surfers, fight
for what thev believe in. This is a truly positive
side of Stanford that prospectives should see.
Student activistshavecompleted successful cam
paigns to change University policies in past years.
I liese new groups are using some of 'the same tac
tics to pressure the I niversity, while drawing in
more students who wouldn't noniiidlv participate.
We applaud the student groups directing
these protests for their are calm, professional
and earnest action. 'I'hey are pushing to make a
difference and change a variety of issues impor
tant to the I Diversity. The students have done
their part to make their voices heard on campus,
in the media and bv the greater campus com
munity. Now the University must do its part to
listen and respond accordingly.
