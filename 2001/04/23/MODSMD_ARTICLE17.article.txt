01 the National Association of Proctologists
(okav. so I gave in\ roommate's name and
phone nnmher to them because, hev. the\
11c alwaxs the hull of some joke). Km we
want them to know tli.it we have no nioncv.
We aie college s|ik let Us, pax ing a licit \ tu
ition. and we have no nionex.
So when I heat tli.it om parents are
hcing (ailed to donate nioncv to the I'ni
veisii\ and that seniois are asked to gixc to
a general hind. I am .1 hit taken ha< k.
Ii seems liK>lish toi Stanford to ask lis —
01 0111 families — lot nionex while we arc
still in s< 11001, while we still pax tens of 1 lion
sands of d< >||.n s e.u h xeat.
I liaxc heard ahont the Senior ( lass (aft
(hiring eat h of nix font xears at Stanford,
and I dothink it isaii iiu redihle gesture that
anx donation I make is matched three-to
one hx Stanford 11 nstee I)r. IVter Hingand
the Parents \dvisor\ Hoard.
\nd don t get me xvrong. donating
moncx to Stanford is xcrx import.int. It
helps pax lot much of the scholar ships that
.1 large inmihei of students rcceixe. We
have .ill heard (hat om tuition alone doesn't
come ( lose to (oxcring the total cost of edu
cation here.
Hut still, it seems inappropriate to ask us
for nionex t igln nox\. Wait until we are a few
veal s out W ait until someone st.u ts a com
panx that makes him 01 her a millionaire.
Wait until we liaxe finished paxingoff our
loans. |ust. please, wait.
I hen. in a few xears. I will lx- more than
willing to donate sonic nionex to Stanford.
I Ins place has certainlx changed mx life for
thelx-ttcr,.ind I want others to liax e that same
ex|x ticn< c. hut, please, gixe me s<>me time.

Predicting that the I nivcisitx and the
Stantord \luinni Asso< iation will not he t«m»
1111 illed with 1 1 us response, 1 have come lip
with an alternative idea through which
casli-stra|)ped students can help raise
inone\ lot Stanford. Instead ol having the
Seniot ( lass give nionev, I herein move
tli.it the (lass of 2001 organize a big
fundraisei to generate mot e tnonev to give

there! Bet everyone likes that idea, eh;

A giant hug.
I his works. Keallv. it does. Saturdav's
San I ram isio ( hronu le reported that stu
dents from both schools tried to beat the
record listed in the (tiiinncss Bookol W'ol Id
Records toi largest group hug last Fritlav at
Stanlord Stadium. I he record hug. pnoi to
Friday, was NOO people, but the two high
schools expected 1.000 to attend. Mono
raised at the event went to charitv.
Now, 1 don't know about \ ou. but 1 don't
like the idea of some high school students
using our stadium fbi their giant hug. Fur
thermore. being the competitive person
that I am. I wouldn't want tlu-ii retold to
stand lot ven long. A thousand people; No
problem. Ix't's double that. I let k. I bet the
Parents Advisorv Hoard would match our
hugs two-to-one.
Imagine how much fun this will be. We
could get meinbci s <>| the intramural teams
from the (iraduate School ol business on
one side of the field and those from the 1 aw
School on the other, and the\ could (barge
at eat h other and. well, hug! We could have
those disgruntled members ol the Senior
( lass in one end/one and I lewlett-Packard
('.hie! F\ct utive ()Hiccr ('..irh Fioi ilia in the
other, and thev could run to the 30-vard
line and hug. We could have the diflerent
departments that make up the Division of
literatures, ( ultuies and 1-anguagcs all
hug and merge together. (011. wait...)
bring the Band. Bring the Free. Not
onl\ would people pav nionc\ to attend atul
participate, I bet we could sell tickets tor
people to watt h in the stands. After all. who
wouldn't want to watch a giant hug? In
doing so. we would all help raise some
money lor the I niversity.
I hen, in a few years, call 11s back, and we
will help out some more.

I Irian Eule hoftes he hasn't offended mix proctolo
gists with a little humor. E-mail the unmuihe co
