Clarification of Faculty Senate article
In \ on i otherwise act urate covet age < >1
the Fat ult\ Senate disc ussion ol the pro
|)t»setl depai linen tali/.it ion ol the Di\ ision
of I .iteratures, Cultures and I .anguages
tins Ihuisdav. \|)iil ID ("Stntlents protest
outside meeting"), I was misquoted as stat
ing that "these [i.e. Frent h. Italian, Span
ish. Portuguese. (Chinese. |apanese. Ccr
inan. Kussian| are all non-native lan
guages in this countn" with respect to the
tlist iplin.u \ glue that will supposedb hold
the new single department together.
M\ point was the opposite — n.uneh .
that I view the native noil-native dis
tinction made In the spokesman lor the
Humanities and Sciences Dean's ()Hice
as a) inaccurate and b) as an unconvinc
ing argument lor the tlist iplinan unit\
ola fused department. Spanish, tor 111-
stance, can hardly he spoken ot as a
"non-native" or "loreign" language in
the state ol ('.alifornia. and multilingual
isin has long been a defining feature of
American lite. Moreover, one ol the de
partments, Comparative Literature, in
cludes a substantial presence of mem
bers ol the Fnglish Department.
In short, the notion that the new uni
fied department would be defined as
devoted to the studv of "on-native" lan
guages and literatures seems to me un
persuasive.

Combining issues at Thursday's
rally does 'disservice'
\ bro.itl coalition of students has taken
up the < barge against racism in our com
munis, spurred In recent acts of racist
vandalism. I lic\ should be applauded for
their at Hons Nothing does more to com
bat 1 at ism in a communitv than a vocifer
ous expression of unitv.
Hut to the etui goal of promoting cam
pus 111111 \ and tt)lerance, 1 hursdavs
iall\ in White I'la/a was tlivisive and
counterproductive. ()ur I niversitv's ad
ininistrators and police take hate crimes
with the utmost seriousness, just as we
do, vet they have no more individual
power to eliminate racism at Stanford
than anvone else.
Flic I niversitv has not had a sterling
record dealing with students tin similar is
sues in the past. However, rallies de
signed to pit tlie students against the Uni
versity (during Admit Weekend, ol all
times) tit) not help to remedy the lack til
communication between students and ad
ministration. Instead, they divide the
community at a time when we should be
standing together.
We are also concerned with the wav
that students tried to combine the positive
lone ot rallies against hate with their own
campaign to prevent the merger ot the
language departments.
We think this does a disservice to ev
eryone by contusing the issues, as well as
trivializing the problem of hate speech.

1 lit- pros and cons <>t .1 single department
of languages versus several are debatable
points. Racism is not.
Furthermore, suggesting that there are
two sides to the discussion over the language
departments does not make one a bigot, as
one of us was accused of being in White
Plaza. 1 rying to assert .is much to generate
political support is disingenuous at best.
Combining the rallies did a disservice
to all issues involved. 1 he responsibilitv
to eradicate hate speech and hate crimes
from our community lies not with "the
I niversitv, but with every individual
student, professor and statl member.
However, by entangling the worthy
cause of eradicating hate speech with the
controversy surrounding the merger of
the language departments cheapens the
first and eliminates anv possibility of ra
tional discourse on the second.

Latest hate crime 'not unique'
A> tiK'iulxM s of Stanford s chapter of
Ml(.hA. we write this letter in solidarity
with the Asian American Students Associ
ation in response to the most recent acts of
hate that were committed on our campus.
I he racist i affiti that w .is tound in our
home in March and April not only con
tained anti-Asian and anti-black lan
guage. hut || included derogatory terms
that targeted (.hicanos Latinos as well.
\\ e do not. however, write this letter only
because there were racist statements
.timed at our communih.
I ike AASA, we t<m> are cont erned and ac
tive students of color, and we share the same
desii e to spread awareness and understand
ing to all memlx'i s of the Stanford conmiii
"it\ • Lven it the graffiti had not expressed
hatred toward C hic anos Latinos, we would
still find it necessan to stand with AASA in a
commonality of purpose: an obligation to
educate communit\ members at Stanford
and bevond so that we max see an end to acts
i>t hatred.
I ui thermore. we would like to empha
si/e that the \ u tmis of these hate crimes are
not just people of color. 1 he graffiti indi
cated that it w.is written on behalf of the
white community; the members of this
community should be equalh outraged.
1 on often, i ac ism is mistakenly believed to
l)e soleh the problem of communities of
olor. It should not beentireh incumbent
upon them to combat it. Racism is every
)od\ s problem, and evervbod\ must be
part of the solution.
We, like AASA, hope that the larger
Stanford conununit\ will think about the
nature of these hate c times and how the\
iffec t us .ill We hope that the communit\

w ill engage in meaningful discourse and
challenge one another to understand the
reality of race relations both within and
outside of Stanford.
We would like to go further, however,
to clarify that this latest hate crime was
not unique: It is merely one of many that
have tainted Stanford's reputation. The
racist graffiti has merely blown the dust
off of long-standing problems, problems
whose remedies can only be found in
proactive change. We challenge the L ni
versity to make a firm committment to
diversit\ on all levels, especially the fac
ulty level. We will not be adequately pre
pared to function in the heterogeneous
world that lies bevond Palm Drive with
out having educators who can provide us
with a wide array of perspectives. We
urge the administration to hire — and
offer tenure to — more women and peo
ple of color. The racist graffiti has, at the
verv least, re-emphasized the salience of
this issue.
I Itimatelv, we want to encourage all
Stanford community members to become
informed and. as AASA emphasized,
proactive. Each of us is responsible tor ed
ucating one another so that we mav create
an environment to foster student success.
Graduates who are successful, in turn, be
come responsible citizens and help to
eradicate racist acts and attitudes. If we fail
to accomplish this, it is because our educa
tion has been incomplete.

Montoya editorial missed important point
I was lup|>\ to see that lhe Daily wrote
.m official editorial oil Krida\ recogni/ing
the important contributions that |ames
\lontova made to the Stanford community
.is the vice provost for student affairs

("Nlontova's service will leave lasting im
pression"). As a Chicana student, however,
1 feel that The Daily missed an important
point in this editorial. Thev tailed to ever
mention the important contributions Mon
toya made as a Chicano. and specifically as
a queer Chicano.
Dean Montoya was the lushest-ranking
Chicano at Stanford, and. as such, he not
only made important contributions to the
Stanford contmunitv at large, but speciticalh
to the Chicano latino communitv. serving
as an exemplary role mcxlel and as an im
portant resource.
Currently, our communitv suffers
from a low number of tenured facultv and
the lack of a solid Chicano studies depart
ment. Now, 111 addition to all this, we will
have to do without the presence of Mon
toya, who often supported, participated
in and funded our events and activities. I
just hope that the campus at large recog
nizes how his departure affects not onl\
the Stanford communitv. but especially
the Chicano Latino and queer commu
nities at Stanford. In addition, 1 challenge
the administration to replace Montova, if
not with another (".hicano I.atino. at least
with another minority.

Look at Mausoleum in 'a new light'
I hough I don't condone vandalism, 1
feel compelled to respond to Ronald
Hilton's April 20 letter ("Students should
respect statues near Mausoleum"). 1 have
just one comment regarding Prof . 1 lilton's
ill-tempered tirade against feminism, po
litical correctness, Halloween and Stan
ford students in general. I'rot*. Hilton. 1

H-1B visa workers are 'slaves'
Never in m\ lite have 1 read a more bi
ased article than what I read toda\ b\ |eff
Negrette, called "Foreign workers face
deportation after dot-com layoffs." Ne
grette obviously believes in slaven and
indentured servitude.
It was niv belief that when the ( i\ il War
ended, so did legalized slaven in this
country. H-IBs are slaves in that they are
imported into this countn tot a specific
job .ind can't quit, lo demand anything
from their employer, such as a dav off or a
pay raise, could mean dismissal and then
ten days to leave the countn. 1 he argu
ment that there is a labor shortage is noth
ing short of "plantation masters" talk.
1 he tact is. the political parties, in a deal
to raise soft campaign monev, allowed the
companies to import employees at low
wages and slave conditions. I his was pure
ly a response to manufacturing competi
tors' importing goods. 1 here is no question
that goods made in ('.hina are as good as or
better than products made in the I nited
States. In fact, the finest bearings, used in
disk (hives and gvro s\ stents for missile de
fense, are made in 1 aiwan.
It should be noted that the best semi
conductors (hardened) are also made in
I aiwan. Solution: Import ( heap labor to
make your product while firing vour high
er cost I S. employees.-Never will happen,
vou sav! 1 personally know of electrical en
gineers that were laid oft and replaced In
11-1 Bs at halt salan.
1 he H-IB (inrent justification can be
found in this recent quote: "Local compa

mt s Cisco. Hewlett-Packard and Intel all
sa\ that they have slowed down but not
stopped their H-l B hiring and that H-l B
workers will be treated the same as their
I S. colleagues when it comes to job cuts."
But H-1 B employees may be less likelv
to get tired because they hold jobs th.it
Intel could not find a single U.S. appli
cant to till, said Zoanne Hennigan, direc
tor of immigration in a recent San Fran
cisco (.hronicle article.
Should you accept the justification that
no one in the I nited States has the quali
fications. then you must accept that Stan
ford and other institutions of higher
learning have departments that are
grossly incompetent or are fraudulenth
bestowing degrees on students that do
not have background to compete in this
high-tec h world.
Further, if that is happening in engi
ncering. then one might extrapolate that
pei haps it is a general condition in all clim
i iplines, and perhaps the best education is
found in institutions located in India, Rus
sia and (Ihina.
