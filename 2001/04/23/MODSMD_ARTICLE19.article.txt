Clarification of Faculty Senate article
In \ on i otherwise act urate covet age < >1
the Fat ult\ Senate disc ussion ol the pro
|)t»setl depai linen tali/.it ion ol the Di\ ision
of I .iteratures, Cultures and I .anguages
tins Ihuisdav. \|)iil ID ("Stntlents protest
outside meeting"), I was misquoted as stat
ing that "these [i.e. Frent h. Italian, Span
ish. Portuguese. (Chinese. |apanese. Ccr
inan. Kussian| are all non-native lan
guages in this countn" with respect to the
tlist iplin.u \ glue that will supposedb hold
the new single department together.
M\ point was the opposite — n.uneh .
that I view the native noil-native dis
tinction made In the spokesman lor the
Humanities and Sciences Dean's ()Hice
as a) inaccurate and b) as an unconvinc
ing argument lor the tlist iplinan unit\
ola fused department. Spanish, tor 111-
stance, can hardly he spoken ot as a
"non-native" or "loreign" language in
the state ol ('.alifornia. and multilingual
isin has long been a defining feature of
American lite. Moreover, one ol the de
partments, Comparative Literature, in
cludes a substantial presence of mem
bers ol the Fnglish Department.
In short, the notion that the new uni
fied department would be defined as
devoted to the studv of "on-native" lan
guages and literatures seems to me un
persuasive.

Combining issues at Thursday's
rally does 'disservice'
\ bro.itl coalition of students has taken
up the < barge against racism in our com
munis, spurred In recent acts of racist
vandalism. I lic\ should be applauded for
their at Hons Nothing does more to com
bat 1 at ism in a communitv than a vocifer
ous expression of unitv.
Hut to the etui goal of promoting cam
pus 111111 \ and tt)lerance, 1 hursdavs
iall\ in White I'la/a was tlivisive and
counterproductive. ()ur I niversitv's ad
ininistrators and police take hate crimes
with the utmost seriousness, just as we
do, vet they have no more individual
power to eliminate racism at Stanford
than anvone else.
Flic I niversitv has not had a sterling
record dealing with students tin similar is
sues in the past. However, rallies de
signed to pit tlie students against the Uni
versity (during Admit Weekend, ol all
times) tit) not help to remedy the lack til
communication between students and ad
ministration. Instead, they divide the
community at a time when we should be
standing together.
We are also concerned with the wav
that students tried to combine the positive
lone ot rallies against hate with their own
campaign to prevent the merger ot the
language departments.
We think this does a disservice to ev
eryone by contusing the issues, as well as
trivializing the problem of hate speech.

1 lit- pros and cons <>t .1 single department
of languages versus several are debatable
points. Racism is not.
Furthermore, suggesting that there are
two sides to the discussion over the language
departments does not make one a bigot, as
one of us was accused of being in White
Plaza. 1 rying to assert .is much to generate
political support is disingenuous at best.
Combining the rallies did a disservice
to all issues involved. 1 he responsibilitv
to eradicate hate speech and hate crimes
from our community lies not with "the
I niversitv, but with every individual
student, professor and statl member.
However, by entangling the worthy
cause of eradicating hate speech with the
controversy surrounding the merger of
the language departments cheapens the
first and eliminates anv possibility of ra
tional discourse on the second.
