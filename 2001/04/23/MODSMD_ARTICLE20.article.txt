lord men s vollevhall team knew
the Bruins would put up more of
a tight the next time the two
teams met.
Saturday, in the first round of
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Tournament, the No. 5
Cardinal ran into a determined
I ( LA team that fought even
hauler than Stanford had expect
ed. I he two teams battled through
five games. si\ match points and a
number of dramatic twists and

marathon match m front of 1,000
