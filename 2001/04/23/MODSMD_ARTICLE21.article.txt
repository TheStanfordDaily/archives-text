ture the title.
"It's definite!) a great feeling, almost a
relief, to go undefeated, but I think our
focus has always been on NC.AAs, said ju
nior keiko I okuda. "We lost one match
in\ freshman year but won NC.AAs. We
went undefeated last veai hut lost NC.AAs.
I know I'd much rather lose matches
throughout the season if that's what it
takes to win NC AAs."
Junior Lauren kalvaria credits the
team's desire to win and its increased ma
turity foi another outstanding season.
"This team is a little younger than last
\cai s. and. at the beginning of the year,
tlu \ were somewhat inexperienced in the
dual-mate h format." kalvaria said. "Ilow
ever, there's been an enormous difference
in the freshman since Indoors in Lehm
an with respect to their ability to compete
under pt essurc.
"1 here have been a lot of tight match
es. even though the score sometimes
doesn't indicate it. Being in these kind of
pressure situations is important in prepa
ration f'ot NC.AAs bet ause each and every
matt h. from the first round onwards, will
require the same kind of focus."
