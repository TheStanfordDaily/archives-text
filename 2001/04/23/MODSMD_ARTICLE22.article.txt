### LIZ LEVEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lit- Stanford women's gym
nastics team had its most success
ful finish in history, placing eighth
.it the NCAA Championships in
Athens, C.a., last weekend. While
the team fell jusi short of its goal of
qualifying for the Super Six, the
second and final day of team com
petition, tht- Cardinal showed
tenacity .is it fought back from
trouble early on to finish well.
Standout individual perfor
mances led the team to a solid
showing, as freshman Lindsay
Wing finished second in the all
around and on beam, and fellow
freshman Lise Leveille placed
1 Ith on the floor exercise.
I CLA came out on top after
the first of two preliminary ses
sions. posting a solid 197.625, fol
lowed In Michigan with a 190.52
and Alabama with a 196.375.
I his left the door open for
Stanford, competing in the sec
ond session, to claim a spot in the
top six. Three of the teams in
Stanford's session were ranked
above the Cardinal, but Stanford
had an edge over the other two.
Arizona State already had two
losses to Stanford this season, and
Denver was ranked 24th going
into nationals.
If Stanford could beat ASU and
Denver and out score Alabama's
196.375, the team would make the
Super Six. 1 his certainlv seemed
possible since Stanford totaled a
197.85 at the Pacific 10 Champi
onships and managed to score a

196.725 .it region.lis. even though
the team struggled at the meet.
What should have been.i sim
ple task turned into .in uphill bat
tle when freshman all-arounder
Robin Phelps hit her head on the
vault during the first rotation and
was sidelined for the rest of the
competition. The team u.is forced
to make substitutions on the rest of
the events and could not seem to
recover from the jolt, suffering
falls on every event. Not until the
end of the meet did the Cardinal
gymnasts begin earning the kind
of scores thev have proved (apahle
of in the past.
Stanford tallied a respectable
49.175 in the team's last rotation
on the floor, but that was not
enough to beat Alabama. Ihe
Cardinal scored a 195.4, ending
up fourth in its session and
eighth overall.
UCLA had the highest score
going into team finals, and the
Bruins again came out on top,
winning nationals with .i store of
197.575 tor their second consecu
tive title and third in five vears.
Georgia came in second, followed
closely In Michigan.
Although the (lardinal hit .i few
snags, some gymnasts were suc
cessful individually. Senior |en
Kxaltadon ended her career on .i
high note, as she was named a Sec
ond I'eam All-Anierican on the
beam for the second vear in a row.
Leveille and Wing qualified foi
event finals and earned 112 irst
Team All-America status on floor
