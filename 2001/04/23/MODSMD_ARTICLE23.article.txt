dual match at the point was 3-3, so
whoever won the No. 3 singles
match would give his team the vic
tory.
With all the pressure mounted
011 his shoulders, Martin did not
let it faze him, as he actualh re
sponded and got better. He even
tually broke back and found him
self serving tor a 5-5 tie.
However, Matkowski earned a
match point at 10-30 with Martin
serving. In the following point,

sent .i ven deep forehand that
Martin managed to chase down.
Martin saved the ball but lofted it

I lowever. the sun seemed to be
shining for the Cardinal.
Matkowski missed the over
head and Martin saved the match.
Martin eventually won the game to
tie it at .*>-5. and both plavers ex
changed games, bringing the
match to a tiebreaker.
Behind the immense support of
.t highh energized home crowd
.ind the rest of his teammates,

Martin raced ahead to a 3-0
tiebreaker lead. Matkowski battled
back, but the lead was too big. and
Martin held on fora 7-4 tiebreak
er advantage to win the match, 3-
6,6-3, 7-0 (4).
"We got a little bit luckv there
[with Matkowski missing the over
head], but 1 think the fact th.tt
Dave had plaved the entire match
up to that point so hard and so well
had some effect on Matkowski
missing the shot.' sophomore
('arter Morris said.
Martin's rebound victorv actu
alh capped a dramatic overall
comeback for Stanford.
1 he ( an imal fell into a 1 -0 hole
after losing two out of three dou
bles matches. The 31st-ratiked
team of seniors Ali Ansari and
Scott\ Scott (24-7) captured the
only doubles win tor Stanford In
beating Krfan Djahangiri and
Lassi Ketola, 8-0.
Although the ('.ardinal was onl\
down a point, this hole was verv
hard to climb out of, considering
the cjualitv of the opponent.
However, Stanford continued
to play its game and eventually
pulled it out.
What was impressive was that
the two singles plavers who have
been struggling of late, Martin and

97th-ranked sophomore R\ an
1 laviland (IS-7). both contributed
to the team win.
At No. 4 singles, Haviland pro
vided .i quick point tor the Cardi

and No. 1 singles, respec tiveh. I his
brought the score to 3-3.
1 he Bruins were without an in
tegral part of their lineup: fresh
man sensation Tobias Clemens.
Me was out of the lineup because
of an hijiu \ that has nagged linn
most of the season.

"I thought the guvs did a great
job in singles, said head coach
Dick Could. "Alex beat the guv
who beat him at the [National
leam Indoors Championship],
K.J. had a solid win, l)a\e was the
last match on the court and pulled
it out in the tiebreaker, and Rvan

after the loss in doubles."
Morris said lie believed that the
win against I'CIA was a defining
moment for the (Cardinal's season.
"1 think the win against I CIA
show s how much we're coming to
gether as a team," lie said. "1 think
the top four did a great job today,
and 1 think that is the t\ pe of per
formance we're going to need in
Athens, (la."
With the win against UCLA,
Stanford look the season series, 2-
1. I CIA beat the Cardinal in
their first meeting in the finals of
the National leant Indoors
Championship, and Stanford
won the l'ac-10 matchup in Los
Angeles. I he two teams might
have another chance to plav in
the NCAA Championships M.iv
19 to Mav 22 in Athens.
Stanford was to have plaved

I SCI on Friday, but with the heavy
rain, the match was postponed to
yesterday, and the Cardinal did
not show am sign of fatigue when
it beat the Trojans, 6-1.
Could was not verv pleased
with the doubles plav, but was im
pressed overall with the wa\ the
C Cardinal handled itself.
"1 thought our doubles was not
very crisp," he said. "However, the
guys rebounded and did a good
job at singles."
Stanford won the doubles point
yesterday, but the sixth-ranked
team of Martin and sophomore
Scott Lipsky (28-5) lost their third
match in a row at No. 2 doubles
against Ryan Moore and Ruben
Torres, 8-4.
Kim and Hippensteel, ranked
No. 24 in the nation, rebounded
from their loss against I C LA In
defeating Andrew Park and Nick
Rainey, 8-3.
At singles, Hippensteel was the
onlv loss in the lineup, as he lost at
No. 2 singles to Moore, 6-4, 6-1.
In a moment ofdeja vu, the
14th-ranked Park pulled out of
his match against Kim at No. 1
singles because of injury. Kim
had captured the first set, 6-1,
.ind Park opted to stop play be
fore the second set got under

way. Park had done the same
thing in the third set of their
matchup in Los Angeles.
To make matters worse for the
Trojans, the Will-ranked Rainev
injured lumself to the point
where he could not serve over
hand and was forced to serve un
derhand in lus match against
Haviland at No. 4 singles. Havi
land won, 6-1, 7-6.

Mat tin said.
"It was a great weekend for us
overall," Ciould said. "It was defi

dual match at the point was 3-3, so
whoever won the No. 3 singles
match would give his team the vic
tory.
With all the pressure mounted
011 his shoulders, Martin did not
let it faze him, as he actualh re
sponded and got better. He even
tually broke back and found him
self serving tor a 5-5 tie.
However, Matkowski earned a
match point at 10-30 with Martin
serving. In the following point,
Matkow ski had Martin reeling and
sent .i ven deep forehand that
Martin managed to chase down.

tiebreaker lead. Matkowski battled

Martin held on fora 7-4 tiebreak
er advantage to win the match, 3-
6,6-3, 7-0 (4).
"We got a little bit luckv there
[with Matkowski missing the over
head], but 1 think the fact th.tt
Dave had plaved the entire match
up to that point so hard and so well
had some effect on Matkowski
missing the shot.' sophomore
('arter Morris said.
Martin's rebound victorv actu
alh capped a dramatic overall
comeback for Stanford.
1 he ( an imal fell into a 1 -0 hole
after losing two out of three dou

team of seniors Ali Ansari and
Scott\ Scott (24-7) captured the
only doubles win tor Stanford In
beating Krfan Djahangiri and
Lassi Ketola, 8-0.
Although the ('.ardinal was onl\
down a point, this hole was verv
hard to climb out of, considering
the cjualitv of the opponent.
However, Stanford continued
to play its game and eventually
pulled it out.
What was impressive was that
the two singles plavers who have
been struggling of late, Martin and

97th-ranked sophomore R\ an
1 laviland (IS-7). both contributed
to the team win.
At No. 4 singles, Haviland pro

1 he Bruins were without an in
tegral part of their lineup: fresh
man sensation Tobias Clemens.
Me was out of the lineup because
of an hijiu \ that has nagged linn
most of the season.

"I thought the guvs did a great
job in singles, said head coach
Dick Could. "Alex beat the guv
who beat him at the [National
leam Indoors Championship],
K.J. had a solid win, l)a\e was the
last match on the court and pulled
it out in the tiebreaker, and Rvan
demolished the gu\ who beat him
in [the match against I CLA] at
l.os Angeles. 1 lie [singles lineup]
seemed to realh earn the team
after the loss in doubles."
Morris said lie believed that the
win against I'CIA was a defining
moment for the (Cardinal's season.
"1 think the win against I CIA
show s how much we're coming to
gether as a team," lie said. "1 think
the top four did a great job today,
and 1 think that is the t\ pe of per
formance we're going to need in
Athens, (la."
With the win against UCLA,
Stanford look the season series, 2-
1. I CIA beat the Cardinal in
their first meeting in the finals of
the National leant Indoors

I SCI on Friday, but with the heavy
rain, the match was postponed to
yesterday, and the Cardinal did
not show am sign of fatigue when
it beat the Trojans, 6-1.
Could was not verv pleased
with the doubles plav, but was im
pressed overall with the wa\ the
C Cardinal handled itself.
"1 thought our doubles was not
very crisp," he said. "However, the
guys rebounded and did a good
job at singles."
Stanford won the doubles point
yesterday, but the sixth-ranked
team of Martin and sophomore
Scott Lipsky (28-5) lost their third
match in a row at No. 2 doubles
against Ryan Moore and Ruben
Torres, 8-4.

No. 24 in the nation, rebounded

Rainey, 8-3.
At singles, Hippensteel was the
onlv loss in the lineup, as he lost at
No. 2 singles to Moore, 6-4, 6-1.

14th-ranked Park pulled out of
his match against Kim at No. 1
singles because of injury. Kim
had captured the first set, 6-1,

where he could not serve over

overall," Ciould said. "It was defi
