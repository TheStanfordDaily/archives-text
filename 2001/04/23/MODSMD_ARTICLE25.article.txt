# Golfers shoot for top prize at Pac-10s
## Card looks to beat Arizona and USC 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
"We're going to bring home the
hardware," freshman golfer An
gela Rho boasted recentlv.
\ssuming that Rho is referring
to a Pacific 10 Conference title,
lather than a couple of nuts, bolts
and screws, the members of the
\<>. f> (. animal seem poised to win
this week at the confcrenc e cham
pionships in I ctnpe, Ariz.
Beginning todav and ending
Wednesdav, Stanford will once
again compete on the b.lOl-vard,
par-72 Karsten Coif Coir.se. fhe
Cardinal took to the same course
two weeks ago at the PINC AS I
Invitational, when it placed fourth
in a field that included all 10 con
ference teams.
But this time around, Stan
ford lias something that it didn't
have the last time it made the trek
to Arizona.
A win.
And that's what Rho's confi
dence stems from. The Cardinal
captured its first team victory of
the season last week at the Peg
Barnard California Collegiate
w hen it won In 15 strokes over sec
ond-place San |ose State on the
Stanford (101l (bourse. Ihe plavcrs
had s.nd .ill season long that good
finishes were nice, but that hold
ing a first-place tropin would help
the team's psvclie even more.
Now the plavcrs have that win,
and tlicv have gained a self-as
suredness that tlie\ despcrateh
needed. As senior Stephanie
Keener said, once the team has a
victorv. it makes everyone believe
that it can happen again.
The Cardinal will need the
boost of motivation as it attempts

to beat No. 2 Arizona and No. !>
Southern ( alifornia to < apture iis
second conference title in three
vears. It will be a tough task, con
sidering that Stanford has ncvei
beaten both the l.ad\ Wilde .its and
the Women of I ro\ in the same
tournament this vear.
Furthermore, host Arizona
State will also be aw < >i th\Â»mponent
this week because it will be plaving
on its home course. 1 lie Fad\ Sun
Devils came close to winning two
weeks ago. finishing second, ahead
of Stanford and Arizona.
"I'm not going to lie. when I
sav we want to win this vear,"
keevcr said, "but we still have to
feel like it's .i regular season event
because, in golf, if von think
about it too much, you won't pl.t)
vour best game."
I he (Cardinal w ill be rel\ ing on
Keever's solid plav. which lias
been outstanding this spring. T he
senior, ranked 12th in the nation
al Colfweck Sagarin polls, won
her second event of the veai at
I enipe and then finished second
last week.
Joining keevcr this week will
be fellow senior 1 lil.u \ I lomcvcr,
freshmen kiin kouwabunpal
and Rho, along with sophomore
kini Rowton.
Surelv, keevcr and llomever,
who guided the team to a confer
ence title in 1009. want to leave the
taste of a Pac-10 championship
win in the mouths of the other
players on the team.
"I'm pumped up about having
the opportune to win this title
again." keevcr said.
Now it seems that all five mem
bers of the squad are reach to win
this week, more so than thc\ were
earlier this vear. So. apparently,
the Cardinal's win last week could
not have come at a better time.
If onl\ thev could do it again.
And bring the hardware home.
