N1 \\ ()RK (AI *) —I \ i'm tin 1 Super Bowl cham
pions h.ivc holes to till A look .it how the Ravens —
and everyone else — did in the \ I I. draft:
Job well done
With three piiks in the first round and five of
the first B*l, the 1999 NPL champion Rams could
liardlx miss strengthening their porous defense. In
D 1 Damione I ewis and safety Adam Archuleta (a
college linebacker), the\ got two first-rounders
who should help right away. Hut PL Rvan Pickett
was ,i first-round reach. Linebackers Pommv Pol
lex .mil Bt i.in Allen make five straight defensive
choices.
Defending champion Baltimore wanted a tight
end and a safety. I hex got the best receiving I Kin
I odd I leap and ,i possible starting safctx in Gary Bax
ter. I bird-rounder ( asex R.ibach might fill .in open
ing at center.
Buffalo addressed problems in its secotidarx (Nate
Clements), DL (Aaron Schobcl and Ron Kdwards)
and backfield ( Prax is Henrv).
C.hicagogot a player tor each spot where it isxveak,
with plax maker W R David I errell and powerful RB
Anthony Thomas — teammates at Michigan — most
notable.
In (*\l Ron Wolf's last draft, the Packers flourished
by getting pass rusher Jamal Reynolds, wideout
Robert Ferguson, DB Bhaxvoh |ueand 1.8 Torrance
Marshall, all nice picks.
Minnesota.lost Robert Smith to retirement and
found a good but raw replacement in Michael Ben
nett. DK W illie Hoxvard from Stanford and DB Eric
kellx should step in at needy areas.

For those who question win New Orleans would
take RB Deuce McAllister, it was to deliver a message
to Rick\ \\ illiams. And to pro\ ide the ret riving Ihre.lt
Williams does not. Third-round I B Sedrick Hodge
could start soon.
Santana Moss will fill the needs of'deep threat and
kick returner for the Jets, who also got an RB. l.a -
ont Jordan, to spell Curtis Martin, and .1 solid (VI
prospect. Kareem McK.cn/ie.
Tampa's biggest needs were OT and the scc
ondarv. CM Rich Mt Ka\ grablied premiet blockei
Kenyatta Walker and DBs Dwight Smith and |ohn
Howell. Walker should start right away.
What were they thinking?
Justin Smith is a nice first-round addition at 1)1- foi
Cincinnati, but not mam other picks adequately tit
needs. And I K Sean Brewer drew this s\ nopsis from
one draft guide:
"Poorlv conditioned athlete w ho needs better rat
ing habits and more dedication to improving his over
all condition. . . . Has a tough guv' attitude that has
gotten him into confrontations with the coaching staff
in the past."
Jerry Jones played the trade-down, trade-up game,
but didn't do a lot with the extra choices. Dallas' first
selection wasQß Quincy Carter at overall, a pro
ject coming ott a bad junior season at (ieorgia.
New Detroit lx»ss Matt Milieu ignored hissecondan
throughout in paving attention to an offense that was
not so lacking. DTShaun Rogers had injury issues.
It's difficult to doubt Colts C»M Bill Polian, but first
pick WR Reggie Wayne wasn't .is needed as defensive
help. He did take four DBs. hut forgot about the 1)1
