### TREVOR SUTTON 
The opening of a multimedia exhib
it spanning half a century in Old Union
courtyard today will mark the culmi
nation of five months of preparation
for this year's Living History Project
team. The exhibit incorporates video
interviews, personal narratives, pho
tos. posters and lectures.
The Living History Project, created
in 1999 by Stanford students to docu
ment key political events through oral
history, will this year feature a dynam
ic presentation titled "Voices Crossing
Borders," a series of case studies on
ideological and political division in
20th century.
The exhibit features four regions:
East and West Germany, India and
Pakistan, Ireland, and North and
South Korea. Each of the four teams
has designed and arranged a large
board space, which will be covered
with representative photos and posters
from each era in its particular region's
past, as well as diaries and testimonies
from men and women who lived and
often continue to live through division
and strife.
In addition, the teams have con
ducted oral and video interviews with
Hay Area residents and people across
the world who have experienced con
flict in one of these four regions over
the course of their lifetimes. These ac
counts will he compiled into four com
parative videos, one for each section of
the exhibit.
The project will also feature films,
teach-ins, lectures and discussion pan
els bv both international scholars and
writers and Stanford professors.

The project leaders, while express
ing exhaustion over the long process
that went into creating the presenta
tion. were optimistic and enthusiastic
about its prospects.
"I feel that the human voices pre
sented in oral .history have the power
to illuminate the shared human expe
rience and shared human suffering
that extends across borders. We want
to provide the first steps toward open
minded reflection and dialogue with
our project," said sophomore Valerie
Brar, co-director for the project.
"We wanted present voices from
all sides of a political conflict in dif
ferent regions of the world. I think
this will really contribute to the
awareness of diversity and history on
campus," added sophomore Irene
Yeh, also a co-director.
