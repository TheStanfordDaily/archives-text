# STEIN'S RANGE OF EXPERIENCES HELPS HIM FACE CHALLENGES AS CHAIR
## 'Love at First Sight for Stein and Stanford CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES BOARD HANDLES FUTURE 
### JOHN SHASANMI 
In the past year, Stanford has expe
rienced a number of high-level admin
istrative changes. Current University
President John Hennessy replaced
Gerhard Casper last summer. Provost
John Etchemendy filled the spot va
cated by Hennessy. The University
has a new dean of admissions, and
next fall will have a new vice provost
for student affairs.
Yet one change that perhaps not
everyone is aware of is Isaac Stein's
promotion to chair of the Board of
Trustees.
Stein, who graduated from Stan
ford in 19H8 with a joint business-law
degree, became the chairman of the
hoard this fiscal year, beginning his
term in July of 2000.
Thou g h such administrative
changes could lead to changes in the
University, Stein said that "the Uni
versity is in such wonderful shape that
nobody's perceiving either a new chair
I of the board I or president as any need
for dramatic change."
"There are a number of good rea
sons for choosing Isaac Stein," Hen
nessy said. "First, his broad range of
experience, both in the commercial
sector and in health care, give him the
background to provide advice on the
wide range of problems facing the Uni
versity."
After his graduation from Stan
ford's MBA-JI) program, Stein contin
ued his involvement with the Univer
sity. He became involved in fundrais
ing for the Law School and was later
asked to join its Board of Visitors. In
1988, he was asked to join the Board of
Directors for Stanford Hospital.
"1 thought it was important, if I
ever had a serious medical problem,
that the place the ambulance stopped
at would have great health care,"
Stein said
He was appointed a member of the
University's Board of Trustees in
1994.
"His breadth of background and
his tremendous ability to work with
a wide range of different people are
major assets," Hennessy said. "Isaac
is also deeply committed to the Uni
versity, a necessary ingredient given
the time demands placed on the

board chair.
Hennessy said other reasons for
appointing Stein to the chair include
his "strong people skills, whether in
teracting with fellow trustees, alumni,
staff or faculty," and his "long history
of interaction with Stanford, |which|
has provided him with tremendous in
sight into how the University works."
SERENDIPITY'
After completing his undergradu
ate education at Colgate University,
Stein moved west to attend Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.
"It was love at first sight." Stein
said. "I can still remember driving up
Palm Drive."
The next year, he decided to enroll
in the MBA-JI) program, which al
lowed him to complete both his busi
ness and law degrees in four years.
After finishing school, Stein moved
through many different careers. He
started out as a partner with the law
firm Heller-Krhman. He later served
as chief financial officer and general
counsel of Ray Can.
During the 1980s, he directed the

group that produced the Hotel tz-
Carlton in San Francisco, wast ir
man of ESPRIT and was also in
volved with a number of biotech
nology companies.
In 1992, Stein was asked by then-
President Casper to chair a committee
to investigate ways of restructuring
and adapting the Medical Center. The
committee's recommendation was
that the hospital, along with faculty
and facilities, should he placed under a
separate entity called the Stanford
Health Services.
"Serendipity is the most important
force in your life, and about all you can
do is help it along and take advantage
of the opportunities that come along,"
Stein said.
Stein noted that he's had lots of ca
reers and that one of the reasons he
chose Stanford was because he felt the
school would prepare him for and en
able him to make such career changes.
In the years since he joined the
Board of Trustees, the board has han
dled such major issues as the General
Use Permit and Stanford's ability to
