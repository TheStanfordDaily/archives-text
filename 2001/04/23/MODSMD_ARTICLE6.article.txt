# STEIN'S RANGE OF EXPERIENCES HELPS HIM FACE CHALLENGES AS CHAIR
## 'Love at First Sight for Stein and Stanford CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES BOARD HANDLES FUTURE 
### JOHN SHASANMI 
In the past year, Stanford has expe
rienced a number of high-level admin
istrative changes. Current University
President John Hennessy replaced
Gerhard Casper last summer. Provost
John Etchemendy filled the spot va
cated by Hennessy. The University
has a new dean of admissions, and
next fall will have a new vice provost
for student affairs.
Yet one change that perhaps not
everyone is aware of is Isaac Stein's
promotion to chair of the Board of
Trustees.
Stein, who graduated from Stan
ford in 19H8 with a joint business-law
degree, became the chairman of the
hoard this fiscal year, beginning his
term in July of 2000.
Thou g h such administrative
changes could lead to changes in the
University, Stein said that "the Uni
versity is in such wonderful shape that
nobody's perceiving either a new chair
I of the board I or president as any need
for dramatic change."
"There are a number of good rea
sons for choosing Isaac Stein," Hen
nessy said. "First, his broad range of
experience, both in the commercial
sector and in health care, give him the
background to provide advice on the
wide range of problems facing the Uni
versity."
After his graduation from Stan
ford's MBA-JI) program, Stein contin
ued his involvement with the Univer
sity. He became involved in fundrais
ing for the Law School and was later
asked to join its Board of Visitors. In
1988, he was asked to join the Board of
Directors for Stanford Hospital.
"1 thought it was important, if I
ever had a serious medical problem,
that the place the ambulance stopped
at would have great health care,"
Stein said
He was appointed a member of the
University's Board of Trustees in
1994.
"His breadth of background and
his tremendous ability to work with
a wide range of different people are
major assets," Hennessy said. "Isaac
is also deeply committed to the Uni
versity, a necessary ingredient given
the time demands placed on the

board chair.
Hennessy said other reasons for
appointing Stein to the chair include
his "strong people skills, whether in
teracting with fellow trustees, alumni,
staff or faculty," and his "long history
of interaction with Stanford, |which|
has provided him with tremendous in
sight into how the University works."
SERENDIPITY'
After completing his undergradu
ate education at Colgate University,
Stein moved west to attend Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.
"It was love at first sight." Stein
said. "I can still remember driving up
Palm Drive."
The next year, he decided to enroll
in the MBA-JI) program, which al
lowed him to complete both his busi
ness and law degrees in four years.
After finishing school, Stein moved
through many different careers. He
started out as a partner with the law
firm Heller-Krhman. He later served
as chief financial officer and general
counsel of Ray Can.
During the 1980s, he directed the

group that produced the Hotel tz-
Carlton in San Francisco, wast ir
man of ESPRIT and was also in
volved with a number of biotech
nology companies.
In 1992, Stein was asked by then-
President Casper to chair a committee
to investigate ways of restructuring
and adapting the Medical Center. The
committee's recommendation was
that the hospital, along with faculty
and facilities, should he placed under a
separate entity called the Stanford
Health Services.
"Serendipity is the most important
force in your life, and about all you can
do is help it along and take advantage
of the opportunities that come along,"
Stein said.
Stein noted that he's had lots of ca
reers and that one of the reasons he
chose Stanford was because he felt the
school would prepare him for and en
able him to make such career changes.
In the years since he joined the
Board of Trustees, the board has han
dled such major issues as the General
Use Permit and Stanford's ability to

develop its land.
Stein said that it has been the goal
of the board to be concerned with the
long-term development and welfare of
the Stanford community.
"My friend, Peter Bing, likes to say
that the role of the board is to repre
sent the interest of the University 25
years from now," Stein said. "And 1
agree with that."
In recalling past meetings with
politicians and the press about issues
surrounding Stanford and the General
Use Permit, Stein said, "It was critical
that we not make commitments that
could damage the University 25 years
from now."
STANFORD'S FOUNDATION
In the past four decades, the area
surrounding the Stanford community
has seen tremendous amounts of
growth. As chair of the Board of
Trustees, Stein has had to deal with
many issues involving the University's
functionality in the face of this growth.
He said he views Stanford's decision
making process as an organic one.
"That's something you don't think
about until you have to look at it to
make sense of it all," Stein said
Stein drew on the analogy of the

University functioning as an orches
tra, with the president acting as the
conductor.
Stein explained that the board con
tinues to iron out misrepresentation
by special interest groups of Stanford's
development plans to the public.
He also added that the board con
tinues to take actions and make deci
sions keeping in mind the kinds of
growth — both for the community and
the academic strength of the LTniversi
ty — that they anticipate for Stanford.
"I don't think that there is another
university that attempts to do as many
things as Stanford attempts to do, yet
remains small and excellent," Stein
said.
He credited this excellence to the
foundation laid out by the founders of
Stanford. He said that while other
universities were started as small en
tities, growing from religious endeav
ors or some other smaller component,
Stanford was created with the full
functionality of a university. And it is
this foundation that has allowed for
much of the success that Stanford en
joys today.
UPCOMING CHALLENGES
Stein said that current issues con
cerning the Stanford community are
the primary responsibility of the Uni
versity officials and not the board
Changes in the board, such as the se

lection of a new chair, shouldn't repre
sent changes in the University's direc
tion, he said.
For instance, the idea of freshmen
not being allowed to have cars would
not be on the board's table, but the ef
fects of the lack of housing and space,
as well as the effects of the energy cri
sis on Stanford's development are is
sues that the board continually tackles.
"We think about the issue of space
and parking, just not about whether
there are cars next year," Stein said.
"Housing, I think, is one of the fun
damental issues facing the Universi
ty," Stein added.
However, the board has many is
sues to deal with as it plans for Stan
ford's long-term future.
"We're delighted with the benefits
of the growth. We're frustrated with
the lack of planning and consequences
of growth. The University is the
largest landowner and human tenden
cy is to covet our resources. It's the re
sponsibility of the University to pre
serve the long-term ownership of our
land," Stein said.
Stein and his wife Madeline live in
Palo Alto and have two children, Josh
and Sarah. Josh is also an alum
nus of the Stanford Business
School, and Sarah is currently in
her first year there.
Stein said he and his family enjoy
traveling to their Utah home to ski.
