# LEADERS PLAN TO CREATE WORLD'S LARGEST FREETRADE ZONE BY 2005

### 
QUEBEC (AP) â€” Leaders of 34
Western Hemisphere nations both rich
and poor agreed yesterday to stick with
an ambitious plan to create the world's
largest free-trade zone bv 2005 and pe
nalize any country that strays from the
path of democracy.
Stepping up to a table in pairs to
sign the accord, the leaders left many
differences unresolved as they con
cluded a three-day summit that was
marred by protests, both peaceful and
violent. President George W. Hush
headed home from his first interna
tional conference to face a tough battle
in winning negotiating authority from
Congress to complete the deal.
"There is no question in my mind
that we have challenges ahead. Also,
there is no question that we can meet
those challenges," Bush said after
scrawling his name on the agreement to
create a Free Trade Area of the Ameri
cas encompassing 800 million people.
In scattered incidents of violence,
anti-trade demonstrators lighted bon
fires and smashed windows in an area
along the St. Lawrence River. But
streets were mostly quiet yesterday,
without the angry clashes between po
lice and some demonstrators that had
marked the first two days of the ses
sion. Since the summit opened Friday,
more than 400 protesters were arrest
ed, and at least 46 police officers and 57
demonstrators were injured.
The duty-free hemispheric zone
stretching from the Arctic to the tip of
South America had been embraced at
earlier summits in 1994 and 1998 but
had lost momentum in recent years. In
staying with the 2005 target, the lead
ers rejected calls to speed up or slow
down the completion date. Venezuela
signed the accord despite reservations
