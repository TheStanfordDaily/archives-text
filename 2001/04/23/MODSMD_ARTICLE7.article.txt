# LEADERS PLAN TO CREATE WORLD'S LARGEST FREETRADE ZONE BY 2005
## 
### 
QUEBEC (AP) — Leaders of 34
Western Hemisphere nations both rich
and poor agreed yesterday to stick with
an ambitious plan to create the world's
largest free-trade zone bv 2005 and pe
nalize any country that strays from the
path of democracy.
Stepping up to a table in pairs to
sign the accord, the leaders left many
differences unresolved as they con
cluded a three-day summit that was
marred by protests, both peaceful and
violent. President George W. Hush
headed home from his first interna
tional conference to face a tough battle
in winning negotiating authority from
Congress to complete the deal.
"There is no question in my mind
that we have challenges ahead. Also,
there is no question that we can meet
those challenges," Bush said after
scrawling his name on the agreement to
create a Free Trade Area of the Ameri
cas encompassing 800 million people.
In scattered incidents of violence,
anti-trade demonstrators lighted bon
fires and smashed windows in an area
along the St. Lawrence River. But
streets were mostly quiet yesterday,
without the angry clashes between po
lice and some demonstrators that had
marked the first two days of the ses
sion. Since the summit opened Friday,
more than 400 protesters were arrest
ed, and at least 46 police officers and 57
demonstrators were injured.
The duty-free hemispheric zone
stretching from the Arctic to the tip of
South America had been embraced at
earlier summits in 1994 and 1998 but
had lost momentum in recent years. In
staying with the 2005 target, the lead
ers rejected calls to speed up or slow
down the completion date. Venezuela
signed the accord despite reservations
about the timing and a provision
called the "democracy clause."
All leaders of the hemisphere were
present except for Cuba's Fidel Cas
tro, who was excluded. The summit
partners added the democracy clause
that could strip a country of member
ship if it ceased to be a democracy, as
in a military coup. The leaders said
that any disruption in the democratic
order of any country was "an insur
mountable obstacle" to membership
in the hemispheric trade club.
Noting that "democracy in certain
countries continues to be fragile,"
summit host Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien had words of caution
for Haiti for its flawed election
last year.
He called on Haitian President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to live up to
promises he made to advance democ
racy and announced that the secretary
general of the Organization of Ameri
can States would go to Haiti to observe
whether such steps were being taken.
Aristide, who became Haiti's first
freely elected president in 1990, fell to
a military coup and was restored to
power in a 1994 U.S. invasion. He
stepped down in 1996 and became
president again last year in elections
boycotted by the opposition because of
a fraudulent legislative vote.
Aristide pledged cooperation yes
terday, but gave no indication of how
he plans to address demands for new
elections. "1 am confident that we will
come out with a quick resolution to
the crisis in the next few days, thanks
to the help of the Organization of
American States," Aristide said.
The overall trade agreement sets a
target of January 2005 for completing
negotiations among the nations of
North, South and Central America.
The pact is to take effect by the end of
that year.
"We must meet the challenges in
herent in the differences in size and
levels of social, economic and institu
tional development in our countries
and our region," the accord states.
The leaders also promised to work
together to expand the war on drugs,

improve election practices, fight gov
ernment corruption, strengthen
human rights, and improve education
and health care.
Congress is deeply divided over
whether to renew presidential negoti
ating authority that Bush needs to
complete the deal It enables the pres
ident to submit trade agreements to
Congress which can be voted up or
down, but not amended.
Bush promised a redoubled effort
to "to get it myself by the end of the
year. "It's in our nation's best inter
ests to have the president have that
authority."
Still yet to be resolved are de
mands by Brazil and others that the
United States dismantle various
agricultural subsidies and anti
dumping laws. Another contentious
issue is whether labor and environ
mental provisions should be en
forced by sanctions, as Democ
rats in Congress are demanding.
Mexican President Vicente Fox
called the summit "a great step for the
entire hemisphere" and said they had
taken negotiations from behind "dark
rooms behind doors" and made them
more open.
Bush expressed solidarity with
Colombia's struggle against cocaine
producers, noting that the United
States is spending $1.3 billion for the
battle and that he had recently asked
Congress for another $882 million
for Colombia and six other nations in
the region.
He said Colombian President Andres
Pastrana was a strong leader "It's going
to be up to President Pastrana to
make the peace," Bush said. "Once
he does, we'll stand by his side."
Pastrana renewed a push for the
United States to drop tariffs on tex
tiles from Andean nations, saying,
"more than money, we're ask
ing commerce."
Asked whether the United States
could look to Canada and Mexico to
help ease its energy crisis, Bush said,
"Canadian suppliers and Mexican sup
pliers are looking fora market. They
found one in the United States."
Chretien said, "We are a great ex
porter of oil to the United States and
it will increase even more in the
years to come."

QUEBEC (AP) — Leaders of 34
Western Hemisphere nations both rich
and poor agreed yesterday to stick with
an ambitious plan to create the world's
largest free-trade zone bv 2005 and pe
nalize any country that strays from the
path of democracy.
Stepping up to a table in pairs to
sign the accord, the leaders left many
differences unresolved as they con
cluded a three-day summit that was
marred by protests, both peaceful and
violent. President George W. Hush
headed home from his first interna
tional conference to face a tough battle
in winning negotiating authority from
Congress to complete the deal.
"There is no question in my mind
that we have challenges ahead. Also,
there is no question that we can meet
those challenges," Bush said after
scrawling his name on the agreement to
create a Free Trade Area of the Ameri
cas encompassing 800 million people.
In scattered incidents of violence,
anti-trade demonstrators lighted bon
fires and smashed windows in an area
along the St. Lawrence River. But
streets were mostly quiet yesterday,
without the angry clashes between po
lice and some demonstrators that had
marked the first two days of the ses
sion. Since the summit opened Friday,
more than 400 protesters were arrest
ed, and at least 46 police officers and 57
demonstrators were injured.
The duty-free hemispheric zone
stretching from the Arctic to the tip of
South America had been embraced at
earlier summits in 1994 and 1998 but
had lost momentum in recent years. In
staying with the 2005 target, the lead
ers rejected calls to speed up or slow
down the completion date. Venezuela
signed the accord despite reservations
about the timing and a provision
called the "democracy clause."
All leaders of the hemisphere were
present except for Cuba's Fidel Cas
tro, who was excluded. The summit
partners added the democracy clause
that could strip a country of member
ship if it ceased to be a democracy, as
in a military coup. The leaders said
that any disruption in the democratic
order of any country was "an insur
mountable obstacle" to membership
in the hemispheric trade club.
Noting that "democracy in certain
countries continues to be fragile,"
summit host Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien had words of caution
for Haiti for its flawed election
last year.
He called on Haitian President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to live up to
promises he made to advance democ
racy and announced that the secretary
general of the Organization of Ameri
can States would go to Haiti to observe
whether such steps were being taken.
Aristide, who became Haiti's first
freely elected president in 1990, fell to
a military coup and was restored to
power in a 1994 U.S. invasion. He
stepped down in 1996 and became
president again last year in elections
boycotted by the opposition because of
a fraudulent legislative vote.
Aristide pledged cooperation yes
terday, but gave no indication of how
he plans to address demands for new
elections. "1 am confident that we will
come out with a quick resolution to
the crisis in the next few days, thanks
to the help of the Organization of
American States," Aristide said.
The overall trade agreement sets a
target of January 2005 for completing
negotiations among the nations of
North, South and Central America.
The pact is to take effect by the end of
that year.
"We must meet the challenges in
herent in the differences in size and
levels of social, economic and institu
tional development in our countries
and our region," the accord states.
The leaders also promised to work
together to expand the war on drugs,

improve election practices, fight gov
ernment corruption, strengthen
human rights, and improve education
and health care.
Congress is deeply divided over

ating authority that Bush needs to
