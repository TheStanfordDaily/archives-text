## FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS PRO-CHECHEN GUNMEN SEIZE HOSTAGES FROM CENTRAL ISTANBUL HOTEL 
### 
ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) â€” At
least 20 pro-Chechen gunmen armed
with automatic rifles and shotguns
stormed into a hotel in central Istan
bul yesterday and seized hostages, po
lice said.
It was not clear if anyone was
injured or how many hostages
were taken.
The gunmen are apparently de
manding to speak with Turkish Interi
or Minister Sadettin Tantan, the Ana
tolia news agency said. Istanbul police
chief Kazim Abanoz said 20 to 25 gun
men were inside the hotel.
Hundreds of police surrounded the
Swissotel in central Istanbul early this
morning. At least six ambulances were

outside of the hotel, which overlooks
the Bosporus.
BTV television broadcast footage of
police crouching behind cars, slowly
approaching the hotel.
"We want the gunmen to surren
der," private ATV television quoted
Tantan as saying.
Hotel worker A1 isan Krcan
said he heard shots and saw four
or five gunmen in the lobby as he
ran from the hotel.
Hotel guests were hiding between
tables in the lobby, Krcan said. Other
guests escaped through fire exits.
The hostage-takers identified
themselves as supporters of
Muhammed Tokcan, Anatolia report
ed. Tokcan is a Turkish citizen of
Chechen descent who hijacked a Turk
ish Black Sea ferry in 1996, seizing
more than 200 hostages.
The hostages were all freed un
harmed after four days. Tokcan later
surrendered to police and was impris-
oned, but was recently released under
an amnesty law. ATV reported that he
was believed to be one of the gunmen
inside the hotel.
In March, Chechens hijacked a
Russian plane with more than 100
hostages from Istanbul's airport in an
apparent attempt to draw attention to
what they called Russian atrocities in
Chechnya.
Saudi special forces stormed the
plane in Medina, Saudi Arabia, after
the hijackers threatened to blow up
the aircraft. A Russian flight atten
dant and a Turkish passenger were
killed, along with one of the hijackers.
Chechen rebels drove Russian
troops out of Chechnya in a 1994-96
war. Russian forces returned to the
breakaway republic in September
1999, but fighting has continued.
The Chechen struggle is popular in
Turkey Turks not only share the Is
lamic faith with Chechens, but some 5
million Turks trace their roots to Cau
casus areas such as Chechnya. Some
'25,000 Chechens live in Istanbul and
western Turkey.
There are about 80 Caucasus orga
nizations in Turkey and many have
been active in promoting the Chechen
cause.
