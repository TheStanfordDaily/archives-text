just blends. And there are some gifts that no one knows what they're
supposed to do.
But give Savings Bonds, and you'll be giving the gift of future
possibilities—from a down payment on a car to help with college
tuition. With eight denominations to choose from, there's a size for
every occasion. You can select the popular Series EE Bond or the
inflation-protected 1 Bond. They're available through most banks, where
you work, or automatically through the new Savings Bonds Easy Saver"
