(>m April 24, 1971. I he Dailv printed an article
about c ampus crime.
"Stanford's ivon towers need locks on the doors
and bars on the windows. Stanford may not be
Berkele\ or New York, but it is not the crime-free
haven it once was.
"According to Stanford Police Officer Pom
Bcrubee, there is no 'safest' residence. Basically, it's
about the same even where.' he said.
"[Rob] Younge has since built an intricate alarm
system for Ruble's stereo using a unique circuit that
is hard to defeat, the second such svstein he has built.
" l ast summer, a prospective thief tampered
with the turntable. Younge explained. 'Police si
lenced the alarm In ( utting the w ires rather than de
activating the system.'
Bottom line: Somehow, the terms "Roble" and "intricate
alarm system" don't seem to go together very well.
