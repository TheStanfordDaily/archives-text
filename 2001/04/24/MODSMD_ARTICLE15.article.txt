Ross have recently been awarded 2001
Guggenheim fellowships by the |ohn Simon
Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. The tel
loU s hi| >s will enable tliese three faculty mem
bers to pursue their scholarly interests through
a year of research.
Nationwide, the fellowship winners include
183 artists, scholars and scientists selected from
more than 2,700 applicants. The awards total

distinguished achievement in the past and ex
ceptional promise for future accomplishment.
" 1 lie lisi ot previous and other current
(iuggenheim fellowship winners includes
manv individuals for whom I have enormous
respect. It's a great honor to be mentioned in
siu h compam." Bernheim said.
Bernheim is a senior fellow at the Stanford
Institute for ft onotnic Polic \ Research. I lis re
search interests are in public finance, industrial

organization and mic roeconomic theory.
"The main impact of the grant is that it al
lows me to foe us exclusively on m\ research
projects next year," he said.
His award will help fund a sabbatical start
ing this fall at the Center for Advanced Stuch
in the Behavioral Sciences, lie plans to re
search a theory of legislative policy-making
and how legislatures select from among differ
ent economic programs.
" I his could be applied to national or state
legislatures or to parliaments iu other coun
tries," he said.
Bernheim said that, in the past decade,
economists have studied how different public
policies affect the allocation of resources in the
economy. More recently, he said, "economists
have become interested in how those policies
get selected and how the features ot the institu
tions that . . . select the policies affect which
policies are chosen."

Harvard I niversitv in 1979 and a doctorate
from Ml I in 1982, He then came to Stanford
