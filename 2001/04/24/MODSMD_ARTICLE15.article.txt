projects next year," he said.

ing this fall at the Center for Advanced Stuch
in the Behavioral Sciences, lie plans to re
search a theory of legislative policy-making
and how legislatures select from among differ
ent economic programs.
" I his could be applied to national or state
legislatures or to parliaments iu other coun
tries," he said.
Bernheim said that, in the past decade,
economists have studied how different public
policies affect the allocation of resources in the
economy. More recently, he said, "economists
have become interested in how those policies
get selected and how the features ot the institu
tions that . . . select the policies affect which
policies are chosen."

Ross links the award to her ca
reer at Stanford. "In the 12 years I
have beep teaching at Stanford as a
lecturer. I have worked steadily to
amplify the position of dance as a
si holarlv disc ipline within this uni
versity. With this fellowship and
the research it will enable me to
pursue, 1 plan to broaden and ac
celerate these efforts as I address
the growing appetite of Stanford
students for more course offerings
in dance studies.
"It would be wonderful to see
dance studies, [both] as an impor
tant humanistic disc ipline, and |as]
a subject that is inspiring increas
ing numbers of undergraduate
and graduate research projects, fi
nally ac knowledged with teaching
appointments at Stanford beyond
lec turerships," she continued.
