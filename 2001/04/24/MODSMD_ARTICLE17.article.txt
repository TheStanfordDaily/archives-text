the Pamplona bull's run ol earlv departures to
professional sports; nor have we had to deal with
athleti( 01 academic scandals. We have even t.iken

before we become too bloated from the self-con
gratulation, we should i ec ogni/e the witches' brew
bubbling ac ross ('.ainpiis I )i ive and ask ourselves,
"Who watc lies ovci the Athletic s Department?"
As an luixled organ ol the I ni
versitv, the Athletics Department does not rel\
on I niversitv funding lor its large operating
budget. (lenerous alumni and private donations
to the department endow athletic scholarships,
while tic ket prices and uniform contracts p.i\ lot
stadium renovations and co.u lies' salai ies.
I he Athletics Department decides what adver
tisements to put in oi keep out <>l Maples Pavilion
and the Sunken Diamond, whether or not to

renew the lucrative contract with Nike, .uicl which
recruits they want admitted to the I niversitv.
I he mating dance that occurs annually between
the Athletic s Department and the Office of Ad
missions and Financial Aid over recruit admis
sions is more nuanced and elaborate than the
Supreme Court's definition ol states' rights and
their supposed right to dec ide anv election.
Before we cry foul here and phone the pro
ducers of "Temptation Island" or "Chains of
Love," we should remember that the admissions
process is well-documented and has been re
vamped main times, making it far less scan
dalous than it appears. But the powei ol money

sions process highlights its autonoim and power.
Lniversitv President |ohn Uennessy is not at
limit here. Much oft he blame falls sc|uarel\ on the
accommodating shoulders of oui former presi
dent, (iei hard ( asper. I le was an avid supportei
ol Stanford athletics. So much so that, under bis
tenure, the Athletic s I)ep.u tinent grew into an en
tit\ with considerable power. Athletic concerns
have become I niversitv concerns. Director ol
Athletics l ed Leland now acts as a second I ni

versity president, presiding over a very public
and independent part of the University.
When Mennessy finally began addressing the
I niversity's abysmal housing situation, everyone
011 campus praised the decision. But when the
committee publicized its proposed sites, one
group 110 longer cheered. Instead, it resorted to
holding the I Diversity hostage with alumni and
donoi monetary pledges. I he University plan
( ailed tin building on the current golf range and
.1 housing complex that would require extensive
restructuring <>112 the first hole of the golf course.
Fear not, friends — an athletic superhero
charged to the rescue. Some may have expected
I iger Woods to sweep in dressed in tights, but it
wasn't him. No, it was none other than Tom Wat
sou, designer of the first hole with its renowned
tree. Watson called and promised to withhold all
Ins money and presence from the University if they
tampered with his course. Flic Athletics Depart
ment entered the debate with its wallets loaded
and fort ed the I nivcrsitv to bat k down faster than
a Nasdaq plunge. Now, the range is being moved,
and the first hole is secure. I he Athletics Depart
ment, more protective of its land than Florida Sec

retary of State katherine I iarris, sent the Universi
ty .t clear message: It will support the University as
long as it doesn't interfere with its territory.
Universities have long recognized the mar
ketability of their athletic teams. Stanford is no dif
ferent, hut that doesn't make it right. In recent
years, bulletins sent to prospective donors for gen
eral University donations have heralded Stan
ford's Sears Cup streak in bold letters above the
fold, while in smaller caps below, there are diminu
tive articles describing Stanford's recent cadre of
Nobel Prize winners. Sounds a little strange, but
Casper knew that athletics were a great breadwin
ner and used them to exploit pocketbooks.
Athletics and academics should maintain their
delicate svtnbiosis where each side of campus
helps the other. Hennessy could learn from the
mistakes of the past and work to reincorporate
the Athletics Department within the University
fold. Meanwhile, the Athletics Department must
remember that, without a strong University,
there would be no department. While the Athlet
ics Department is a very important part of the
University, its concerns shouldn't come before
other vital campus issues.
