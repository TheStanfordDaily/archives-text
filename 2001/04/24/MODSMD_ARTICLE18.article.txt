# DEEP IN LEFT FIELD
## The
						problem with Res Ed 
### 
We live in a rat ially tlivitlct I com
munity. 1 find iliis veiy sur
prising considering how
niucli Stanford, as .in mstiiu
tion, values diversity I )ivei sit\ has led Si.in
fold to recruit and admit students of all col
ors and backgrounds, but few students have
am it lea of what's going on in social com
munities other than their own. I his isn't ]iist
a statement about am specific communitv
— it goes tor evervhotlv. You'd think that, if
we really valued diversity as much as we sav
we tit), this wouldn't be the case.
I recentlv'heard ASSI

President-elect Matt
Brewer say, "Diversity
isn't just having a bunt li
of different people in a
room together." and 1
agree with him complete
ly. We treat racial diversi
ty like a statistit that
makes us feel gotxl alxmt
t>m st liool. but is thai all it

is? Shouldn't we Ik 1 taking something .iw.i\
fix>lll Stanford and .ill its diversity after our
four vears here? Shouldn't we Ik- learning
something alh>iit the |x*ople we would never
have encountered had we not attended .1 di
verse institution like Stanford?
I he t\|>e of learning that we're talking
about here isn't elassrootn education. It's the
kind of learning that hikes plat eon .1 dav-to
da\ basis, in the evcnda\ encounters we're
sup|M>sed toln-having with |x-< >ple who don't
l< k»k like us. who don't think the wav that we
do. It's the kind <>l informal learning that we
get while living 111 close quarters with a di
verse group of people. It's exact Iv what the
()lli(eof Residential Fducation talksalxnit in
its mission statement. How successful is Res
Kd in achieving this goal?
If Res Kd were completelv successful, we
would probablv see "pet led disorder" (to
Ixirrow a term from niv premed davs) in the
wav students distribute themselves phvsu ,il-
Iv across this campus following their fresh
man year. In other words, even student, re
gardless of color, would Ik- as likelv t<> live in
one place 011 campus .is anv other, but this
isn't what happens. Freshmen start out in
residences where tliev live with students of
all different backgrounds, but, later on. tliev
tall into predictable patterns of so rial and
residential division. I loused fraternities and
sororities draw most 1\ White students. Most
Black students choose to live 011 the west side
of campus, and certain dorms and theme
houses have a reputation for drawing large
numbers of Asian and I -itino students.
In the past,efforts have been made toad
dress racial division on campus. 1 liese ef
forts have not Ix-en overwhelmingly sue

tessful because tliev have been tlirectetl at
the wrong target. Racial division isn't the
problem; it's the symptom.
Segregation is the result of a unit h more
complex problem that begins from the mo
ment students move into their freshman res
idences. I'll is is where freshmen are first in
troduced to the tlivei sc Stanford communi
tv. I his is where crt >ss-racial interactions and
discussions about race first lead to misun
derstandings that students m.iv cany with
them for the rest of their years here. I'm not
talking alxiut overt lv hostile etu mi liters, but
rather the little things — the evciydav liui
dents that atltl up ovei time and lead to two
unfortunate results. First, that students of
color mav feel that tlieii interests are
marginali/ed b\ the community. Ami, set
ontl, that White students ma\ feel tliev are
being blamed for all of stxiety's ills.
In a resident e. resident assistants are the
leaders who could address these issues, but,
unfottimatek, Res Kddtx'sn't train them to
recognize 01 deal with situations where rat e
becomes a barrier to communitv. As an all
frosli RA, I can honestlv tell vou that,
throughout the two-week RA training peri
od. the onl\ resolute we were given for this
purpose was a video associated with the Pro
tocol to Address Acts of Intolerance and
I lircats to ('.ommunity. called "Wedges and
Splinters." It's a five-minute video that RAs
are supposed to show residents when prob
lems of intolerance arise. It's the most use
less. inarticulate video I've ever seen. (. >< >
ahead, ask your RAs it tliev renietnlx.T it
from training. They'll laugh.
If that's the Ix st that Res Kd can do, Stan
ford is in trouble. 1 lie nation's racial composi
tion is shifting dramaticalh, as (lensustlata will
tell vou. Soon, the coni|x>sition of Stanford's
student Ixmlv will shift as well. Ihis means
more interactions Ixlw«en students of tliffer
ent I >at kgr< minis ant I the |x »ssil )ilitv«>f greater
divisions Ixlween groups, as well as higher
anxiety among students who harbor "White
supremacist" attitudes, such as the icliot who
denigrated our campus with rat ist graffiti ear
lier this vear. If we can't adequately addivss at
titudes alx)iit race dminga student's fii-st vear,
then divisions will onlv Ixtonie tltvjx-i .mtl
st n>i iger wit 11 eat I i passing vear.
I've spent this column outlining the prob
lems with race and Res Kd. Next time, I w ill
offer some thoughts alxnit how to improve
the situation. You might think that vou t an
tell where I'm going with this, but you might
lx- surprised. (.tune back next week and see.
