### ROBIN BURNS 
I ho Queer-Straight Social and
Political Alliance will hold its inau
gural meeting tomorrow. Hie new
student group, founded bv sopho
mores Jesse I,vans and Caroline
I lopper, hopes to iiu rease the visi
bility of the homosexual communi
ty on campus while providing so
cial events that are easih accessible
to .til students.
Eventually, the group will
have a dual focus, fostering both
social and political activity, l itis
quarter, though, it will foius on
social events.
Evans said that manv of the so
cial organizations and events avail
able now are run In ,i very small
group of active students. As such,
the\ often blend too easily into po
litical activity. and students who do
not want to be as openl\ involved
are excluded.
"One of the major things that
prompted the organization of the
c lub was the realization that there
was a large queer community on
campus, but .1 ven small amount
that were involved.' Evans said.
1 here were a lot of people walk
ing around feeling verv disenfi an
chisecl. We want to give them
something to come into, some
thing to join that will connect
them."
In addition to standard social
events, meetings will include re
ceptions at which the officers will
facilitate conversation among the
attendees.
"If one person decides to show
up who doesn't know anvboch but
really wants to be a part of some
thing, they've got people there
whose specific job is to make sure
that tliev are as comfortable as pos

sible," Evans said.
Ihe group's formal politic al
campaigns will begin fall quarter.
For now, its founders want to focus
011 raising the \isibilit\ of the ho
mosexual communitN.
"1 hope it will give people more
pride and [that] it will build a lot ot
unity," I lopper said.
Evans said tli.it the current at
mosphere at Stanford tends to
ovetlook the importance of homo
sexual issues.
"Stanford's liberal, [politicalh
correct] front is great in a lot ot
ways, but it's also stifling," he said.
" File move is realh to try to mai â€¢
ginalize differences, but the prob
lem is that [these ditfet enc cs| realh
are big things. I'he\ realhdic tate a
lot about vour lite."
According to the group, its ac
tive < anipaign for \ isibilitv will dif
ferentiate it from similar groups.
It will also differ in its focus 011 sex
ual orientation as an issue in and
of itself. Main otliei campus
groups, such as the Fatinoorgani
zation Familia, focus 011 the inter
section ot sexual orientation with
other identities.
"In terms of [undergiaduate
groups] that are doing any kind ol
visibilitx raising, I think we provide
a much more up-front position,"
Evans said. "We put queerness
first. We're much more basic and
radical in that sense."
Some students have expressed a
lack of interest in the issues the
founders address. I hose who clo
feel informed enough to c omment
are skeptical about the benefits of
increased publicity.
"Sometimes I feel like it's ovei l\
done," said one freshman. "(Ac -
