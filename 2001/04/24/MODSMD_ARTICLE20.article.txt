Foundation 'brings rich and needed
resources' to Stanford community
In reading articles and letters in your
newspaper, I've been discouraged that
much ol the information that people have
heard about the Carnegie Foundation tor
the Advancement of Teaching's plans to
build its permanent home in Santa Clara
(.ountv is wrong. And I've been concerned
tb.it out Board of Supervisors has allowed
this fine institutionto suffer through two
years and enormous expense jumping
through hoops to then lias the project bur
dened with untenable restrictions that may
chive them out of the county.
Look at the facts. Co to their Web site.
The foundation is planning on huiding a
relatively small, barn-like structure that
will fit appropriately into its surroundings.
Carnegie's building plans will improve
this particular property. This site is clearly
in an already developed area, and, with its
proximity to the other research centers,
like the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences and the National Bu
reau of Economic Research, this is obvi
ously a logical place for the foundation
and its work.

I lit- County Planning Commission ap
proved this project. The county staff has
recommended that the Board of Supervi
sors approve it. The site and the project
are consistent with the new Community
Plan and General Use Permit. This foun
dation. which has been helping teachers
and promoting good teaching for almost
100 years, brings rich and needed re
sources to our community. It would be
tragic to lose them, and heartbreaking to
lose them because our Board of Supervi
sors is making poor decisions based on bad
information.
