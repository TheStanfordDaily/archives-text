# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Turkey, U.S. unwilling to acknowledge Armenian genocide 
### CHRIS GUZELIAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
Before enrolling at Stanford's I .aw School, 1
applied fora stipend sponsoring two years of
study at Oxford University. For the competi
tion. I was advised to write about something 1
keep close to my heart. And, so, 1 penned a
m.indatorv 1000-word essay on a topic that
wrenches mv heart. I wrote of the Armenian
genocide of 1915, conducted in the heart of the
Ottoman Empire. Today, .April 24, is com
memorated by millions around the world ;ls Ar
menian (ienocide Remembrance 1 )ay.
During my scholarship interview, tin-com
mittee chairman, somewhat exasperated,
asked me, "I read your essay about your fami
ly's persecution during the genocide. It's a nice
narrative. But, I have to tell you, I couldn't
help but think, 'Wouldn't it be great if aliens
could just come down to this planet and make
us forget all of the past?' "
On Jan. 18 of this year, France passed a
simple referendum publicly recognizing the
Armenian (iencxideof 1915. Turkey now em

bargoes numerous French imports.
On Feb. 23 of this year, Dr. Taner
Akcam, a Turkish citizen and history pro
fessor, shocked a national Turkish audi
ence by saving. " The constant refrain of
'We [Turks] are not guilty.' and the paral
lel blaming of the Armenians, the victims,
very much hurts the cause of Turkey. I n
less we distance out selves from the perpe
trators of this crime, which was a geno
cide, we will never be able to extricate our
selves from this burdensome onus."
Enraged callers inundated the television stu
dio's phone lint's. ()ne caller was tire widow of a
former president ofT urkev. She shouted,"! low
dare you let this man speak? Shut him up!"
Shut him up. Don't dare to pass that reso
lution, France. .Aliens should make you forget
the past, Chris. I could spend the remainder of
this piece telling you stories about I ,50(),()()()
out of 2,500,000 Ottoman Armenians who
died. But this verbiage shall bear little fruit, I
am afraid. Because, tomorrow, like any self-re
specting, balanced newspaper, this paper will
likely print a response by some of m\ Turkish

friends. I he\ will tell you that 1 am sorely mis
taken or, even worse, that 1 am intentionalh
rewriting history-. That the .Armenian "geno
cide' was simph the result of quelled (i\ il un
rest initiated l>\ renegade Armenians against
the Ottoman government. That I have m\
numbers wrong. That ( In is, simply put,
needs to "shut up about Soykimn, which is
Turkish for "geiux ide."
And jxrhaps m\ Turkish friends will take
some satisfaction from this opinion Ixrause I'm
going to shut up. Tin not going to talk in hack
neyed generalities. I won't tell vou that 1 litler jus
tifiedthe I lolcxausl In saving,"Aftei all,whouxla\
rememl x*rs the slaughtei of the Armenians?"
I won't go into the details of the death
inarches, the concentration tamps, the
rapes, the nmrdei s, the pillage, the destruc
tion. Instead, I'm only going to mention one
clan — the (iihilians — m\ grandmother's
family. M\ great-grandmother was raped in
her vegetable fields b\ Ottoman Turks on
m\ family's larm on a bright Ma\ da\. M\
two wailing infant great-uncles, wrested
from m\ great-gi .mdmother's breast, were

silenced l>\ bayonets before hei anguished
eyes. My great-grandfather languished for
years in a prison camp. And yet the I nited
States does not recogni/e theit plight, or the
Armenian genocide.
Wh\ do m\ furkish friends feat at knowl
etlging that the ()ltt)tnan l.mpire pel pet rated
genocide against tin family?
I cannot speak tbi Turkey, but I t an speak
as a disciple of the polestar of intfiyitlu.il liber
ty. And, it you reside in America, 1 have little
doubt that that is what you are. too (and that is
true w hethei vou are of Armenian, I'm kish 01
of another heritage). President Kill Clinton
found it necessan to dissuatle ('.ongress last
\ear from passing genocide recognitit>n legis
lation because Turke\ thre.itened to fort e
I S. armed fbrt:es to withdraw from furkish
military bases. We have hat 1 to allow 112 iance to
lead the charge of just it e fin the (iibilians.
highty-six years ago, in\ family was nearh
exterminatetl. I he 1 urkish government dis
honoi s thetn by describing thousantls of
scholars, including main lurks and, now,
even the nation ot France, as deluded histori

cal reconstruct ionists. And. just last week,over
100 deluded' I S representatives signed a
petition imploring President (ieorge Bush to
lormalh recognize the Armenian genot ide.
And. so, 1 ask \ t»ii to write President Hush
and \oui representative on thisCientxide Dav
and letjuesi lortnal recognition of the Arme
nian genocide. lell them that the United
Stati s w ill not permit yet another year to pass
in whu li a .slaughtered people are allowed to
he t har.ti terized .is insurgents who "got their
own." I'ell them that m\ tamily, your iamilv
and .ill families have always had an inalienable
right to he secure from those who would re
sort to tyranny ovet denuxracy. Tell them
that we, the indomitable wards «>l individual
liberty, will participate with I'urkey no more
in this cabal behind an unjust veil of inten
tional ignorance.
