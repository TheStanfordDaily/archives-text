## Baseball wraps up tough weekend with a victory 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
A prevailing thought must have
swept through the minds of Stan
ford players and coaches after a 9-5
victory over Southern California
on Sunday.
"Get us out of L.A."
Stanford's win in the rubber
game was a bittersweet ending to
its trip to Dadaeux Field, as the
top-ranked Cardinal (32-10, 11-4
Pacific 10 Conference) dropped
the first two games of the series,
2-1 and 7-0.
1 he two losses on Friday and
Saturday halted the Cardinal's
regular season series victory
streak, which ended at 17. Having
come off Of a 5-4 loss to the Uni
versity of San Franc isco last l ues
day, it was also the first time Stan
ford had lost three games in a row
since Feb. 1999.
By the time the players took the
field on Sunday, then, thev must
have been wondering how to get
another tallv in the win column, a
mark that had surprisingly come
so easily to the- squad up to this
point in the season, fliey also
knew that I SC. (29-14, 10-5 Pac
-10) wouldn't let them take the
third game very easily because the
Trojans were bent on revenge for
a series sweep at Sunken Diamond
earlier this year.
However, the Cardinal re
hounded from.in earlv 5-2 deficit
on Sunday to snag a win against
the Trojans to salvage a game in

the series, preventing its being
swept for the first time since 1997.
I he win allowed the Cardinal to
take a vital one-game lead in the
Pac-10 standings.
Senior Mike Gosling (4-0)
pitched his first career complete
game, picking up his fourth win of
the season, giving up five runs on
six hits. After allowing five runs in
the first three innings, Gosling set
tled in, retiring 13 batters in a row.
"I just wanted to pitch well and
allow us to get back in the game,"
Gosling said.
As Gosling began to show his
true form on the mound, junior
(ihris O'Riordan helped the Cardi
nal mount an offensive attack that
would eventualh give Stanford the
lead. O'Riordan hit an RBI single
in the top of the fifth inning that
scored junior Arik VanZandt to cut
the Trojan lead to 5-4. Later, O'Ri
ordan continued Stanford's stor
ing surge by hitting a sacrifice flv
th.it scored junior Scott Dragice
vicli to give the Cardinal an 8-5
lead. O'Riordan tied his career
high with four RBI on the dav.
Another good sign for the Car
dinal on Sunday was the return of
sophomore Jason Cooper to the
starting lineup. Hie sophomore
designated hitter, who injured his
right knee in a game against Cali
fornia last month, made two plate
appearances as a pinch hitter on
Saturdav before going 2-tbr-5 with
a home run and two RIM on Sun
day. ( oopcr's one-run blast, whii h
gave the Cardinal a 9-5 lead in the

top of tlit* ninth inning, was his sev
enth home run of the season.
1 he offensive prowess that the
Cardinal showed on Sundav was a
major step up from the lack of pro
duction it showed in its first two
games. The Trojans' Friday night
starter, Mark Prior, limited the
Cardinal to one run, while Satur
day's pitcher, Rik Currier (8-1),
held Stanford scoreless through
eight innings of work.
"We just got shut down," said
head coach Mark Marquess of the
Cardinal offense in the first two
games of the series. "It's tough to
win when you onlv score one run
in 18 innings. That's a credit to
their pitching."
Stanford's starting pitchers,
sophomore Jerenn Guthrie (8-2)
and junior Jeff Bruksch (8-1). each
picked up a loss in the series.
Guthrie pitched well on Friday,
giving up two runs on six hits in
eight innings of work, but found
himself in a pin hing duel with one
of the conference's premier pitch
ers in Prior (11-1). A solo home run
In I rojan catcher Alberto (loncep
(ion in the bottom of the eighth in
ning proved to be the difference,
despite the Cardinal putting two
runners on base in the ninth.
Prior finished with 12 strike
outs and was successful in aveng
ing his onlv lo>s of the season,
which occurred Mart li 9 at
Sunken Diamond.
Bruksch puked up bis first loss
from the plate on the season Satur
day, giving up six runs on nine hits

in tour innings of work lie tore
sophomore I nn Cunningham
came on in relief in the fifth inning.
In addiiion to It ruksch's
mediocre pitching, the Stanford
offense sputtered to a halt, as the
Cardinal suffered its first shutout
in lf>7 games. The last time Stan
ford had been shutout was on Feb.
5, when it lost, so. to Cal
State-lullerton.
It wasn't as it the C ardinal
lacked chances to score in Satur

day's game either. Stanford left 1(1
runners on base and had the bases
loaded twice in the fourth and
eighth inning.
Fvcn worse, the 7-0 loss to the
I rojans was the onlv one of the
three games that w.is nationalh
televised In Fox Sports Net.
which could have a
significant effect on the Cardi
nal's national ranking. I he game
was repla\ed on a national broad
cast on Sundav as well. so. while

Stanford was finally producing
some offense in its 9-5 win. manv
parts of the country that had
missed Saturday's game also had
.t chance to watch Stanford lose
badlv to the Trojans.
I he Cardinal now shifts its at
tention to San |ose State, which it
will host at Sunken Diamond
tonight at (>:()() p.m. I lie team will
then travel to (Lai, where it will play
a three-game series with the Bears
beginning Friday afternoon.
