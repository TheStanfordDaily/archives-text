Arizona does not reflect it, a struggle took place.

notching 14 strikeouts, the most the Cardinal

After a disappointing showing in Tucson, the
Cardinal was more than ready to show the Sun
Devils what they were really made of.
"We were all pretty much dissatisfied with the
way we hit in the Arizona game," sophomore
Cassi Brangham said. "As a result of that, even -
one was even more focused at the plate and real
ly ready to score a bunch of runs."
The Cardinal was forced to wait for its come
