# Groupies deserve a spot in the headlines
## 
### 
In the many years in
which I have watched
sports news programs re
lated to college sports, 1
have noticed a startling omis
sion Irom their list of newswor
thy topics. It is hard to imagine
that this subject could be con
sidered taboo in an age when
evervone in college sports is .1
target for criticism. And, given
the ratings generating power
of similar topics in other gen
ii's, I am .it a loss as to how such
an important part of collegiate
athletics could have gone tin
analyzed for so long.

So, fear not
conce r n e d
reader, you will
not be held in
the dark any
longer. Mark
this date on
your calendars,
for today is the
day that a

member of the press finally takes
a look at the role of groupies in
college athletics.
Referred to by experts as
Groupious Athleticus, groupies
are easily recognizable on any
college campus. They are pri
marily identified by their
matching tube tops, skin tight
black capris pants, and uniform
distribution of highlights
throughout their hair. They are
most commonly seen at any
sporting event in which the av
erage height of the players ex
ceeds 6-foot-2.
The role of the groupie in
sports performance has been
grossly underemphasi/ed in
media circles. While high-paid
analysts are always ready to
locus their analyses on condi
tioning, coaching, health and
other related factors, they have

been far too wan to recognize
the impact that groupies have
had on the NCAA.
Perhaps the most important
contribution the groupie has
made to the college game has
been the shameless and persis
tent stroking of the egos of the
players whose every move they
have been pathetically follow
ing. I hough this trait is univer
sal to .ill groupies, the manner
111 which individual groupies
will go about affixing their lips
to the backside of the nearest
athlete can differ greatlv. Ilie
two most popular techniques
appeal to be the machine-gun
approach — throw yourself at
every player on the team and
you are bound to hit one of
them — and the decathlon ap
proach — try out one athlete in
each of 10 different sports in
order to prove yourself a more
well-rounded groupie. One
cannot quantify' the effect that a
super-inflated ego can have on
a player's on-field performance.
Another contribution not to
be overlooked is a phenomenon
that 1 have termed the sec
ondary cheerleader effect.
Groupies, when they are pre
sent at a sporting event in all of
their collective sycophantic
glory, effectively comprise a sec -
ondary group of completely tin
knowlcgcdable supporters no
torious for yelling in support of
their assigned target despite the
fact that they have no idea what
is actually taking place on the
field.
Such misplac ed c heering not
only provides an emotional
boost to the home team, but
may also distract opposing
teams' members, who, upon
