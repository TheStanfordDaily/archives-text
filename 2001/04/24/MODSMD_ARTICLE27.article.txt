# Tough East Coast trip good preparation for Cardinal women's lacrosse team
## Stanford falls to Boston Collge and University of New Hampshire 
### SARA LEV CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I his weekend may have marked a
dark moment for the Stanford women's
lacrosse team, but the two losses the
Cardinal snrrendeied on this week
end's road trip still can't cast a shadow
over what has heen a generally bright
year full of improvement and success
for the women.
I his weekend's trip to New Kngland
was disappointing, .is the Cardinal fin
ished off its regnlai season with a 19-6 loss
on Saturdav to the New Hampshire
Wildcats and then a l'.M loss on Sunda\
to the Boston College Kagles. Despite the
losses, the team is not willing to considci
the weekend .1 setback as 11 approaches
next weekend's Western Women's
Lacrosse League playoffs.
"When you look .it the big pit tine, the
fact is that everything we take from last
weekend will be important in this coining
weekend's plavoffs," said head coach
Michele I hlfelder. " 1 he results of the
road trip didn't put a damper on our sea
son at all."
Stanford's record now stands .it I l-. r >
overall and.it a dominant 6-0 in its con
ference. In addition to being undefeated
in their league, the women are set to
enter this weekend's tournament as the
reigning WW I,L c hampious foi the past
three vears, as well as boasting a No. L'O
ranking from the Intercollegiate
Women's College Lacrosse Association
this is the first time m the team's histon
that 11 has been nationally tanked.
I his weekend's matches, however.

found Stanford struggling to shut down
the strong and athletic offensive prowess
of its New Kngland competitors and hard
pressed to find the back of the net on its
own attacking end.
In Saturday's game at New Hamp
shire, the Cardinal faced unavoidable
change-ups within its defensive lineup
with three starting defenders missing
part or all of the game.
Freshman defensive stai Katie Crube
missed the game because of a family
emergency, senior defender and team
tri-c aptain Dana Katter was still recover
ing from an ankle injury she suffered ear
lier in the season and freshman Larissa
Conte was out most of the first half after
being hit in the mouth.
I lie Wildcat attackers were able t<>
take advantage of holes in the Cardinal
defense as a trio of New Hampshire of
fenders posted stellar performances.
( olleen (Christopher, |essie (iros/kowski
and Sue Yund scored six, five and four
goals, respectively, for the New Hamp
shire squad.
After trailing the- Wilde ats, 16-3, at tlu
ll.illume break, Stanford was able to
match New Hampshire goal 101 goal in
the second half. Both teams scored three,
but (lie (Miidin.il was unable to make up
the large clefic it it fiu ed.
I hlfeldei saidshedidn't think that the
game's outcome had much to clo with
c lianges 111 hei team's defensive lineup.
"We don't (onsidei fiictoi s like pel sonnel
( hange-ups as exc uses." she said. "We tr\
to foe us 011 our fundamentals as a team
and, as a team, we didn't adjust verv well
to New Hampshire's speed. We were
caught on oiu heels against a vcr\ prolif
ic attacking team."
I lie- Boston ( ollcge mate h-iipon Sim
da\ found the Stanford squad in a simil.u
situation. Ihe Kagles came out on fire
right from the start, scoring seven goals in

.i row. Stanford sophomore attackei Li/
Lanesc was ilie first to score tor the Car
dinal, ending the Katies' unanswered
scoring spree with 7:54 leit in the halt.
Once again, though, the Stanford
team was nnahle to find the spark it need
ed to climb out of tin- hole it had dug it
self. No Cardinal player scored more
than once in Sunday's game, and the day
ended with only font Stanford goals tal
lied on the scoreboard.
"We need to come out strong from the
start," I'hlfelder said. "When we didn't
I >iit the hall in the net earlv on, the other
team's defense got a confident e boost, and
11 Kit just made it more difficult for us."
both I hlfelder and her players said
tliev fell that the weekend demonstrat
ed the importance of continuing to im
prove basic fundamentals of theii |>la\
in ordet to (dine out ahead against top
notch opponents.
"Although there were specific things
we inighi have done better in ordet to
combat the si\le <>l both teams, wli.it we
l eallv needecl to do was better execute the
fundamentals of the game." s.iid senior
tri-captain and team leading scorer
K.ithat me Barnes.
" 11 lis weekend, we were gi\en an op
port in in \ to push our skills and intensity,
and we c anie out of these two games with
.i better understanding of |ust what we
need to do to be reach to play lacrosse at
a highei level."
I hlfelder emphasi/ed that she doesn't
c are about the scoreboard in anv of her
team's games, hut instead onl\ fexuseson
improvement. "I think this weekend
demonstr.itcd to out players how impor
tant the little things like defensive posi
tioning. running through ground balls
and basic stic kwotk are,' she said. "Now
\\c need to uke what we have learned
.iixl start implementing it in pi ac tic e and
also in games."
