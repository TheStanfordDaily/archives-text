### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Flic Alfred I*. Sloan Foundation recenth
announced th.it Stanford professors
I longjie I )ai, an assistant professoi of c hein
istr\. and Andrea tioldsmith, an assistant
protessoi ot eleetric.il engineering, were
(liosen out of 10 1 scientists and economists
to each receive a two-vear research fellow
ship worth $40,000.
1 he Sloan Reseat th Fellowships were es
tablished in 19.*)") to give vonng, newlv ap
pointed st ienlists support and ret ognition.
Its purpose is to stimulate fundamental
research bv \oiuig scholars ot outstanding
promise,' states the fellowship's brot luire.

Both professors said that thev were grate
ful to receive the grant and that their fellow
ship mone\ would be used to make reward
ing. fundamental and practical advances in
their respective fields.
"li is a great honor to receive the fellow
ship, and it will be a great catalyst to our re
search." Dai said.
Dai's research focuses on tlu- chemical
synthesis of nanostructuted materials, ex
ploring their potential use.
"Nanostruc ture materials have different
propei ties than hulk material, and synthesiz
ing these materials may be ver\ rewarding
for practical implications." Dai said. "[ This
research] c an he- integrated into micro-elec
tronics, biological devices, communication
dc\ ices and new generations of computers."
When asked what his goals are, Dai re
sponded that lie would like to realize "bigger
disc overies and bigger worlds."
(•oldsmith researches wireless technolo
gies and works towards fast, reliable infor
mation exchange between low-power,
pot table de\ it es.
"The award honors our research in the
area of multimedia wireless communica
tions, and 1 plan to use the fellowship mone\
to (ontinuc working on fundamental break
throughs in wireless system design." Gold
smith said.
Applications of hei research include
portable net-enabled information devices,
wireless P(" networks, wireless video and
music systems, smart homes and appliances,
remote learning and telemedicine, sensor
networks, and automated highway systems.
Klectrical I tigineei ing Prof, Bruce Woo
len . the chair of the department and the fac
ulty member who nominated Goldsmith for
the fellowship, praised her accomplishments
in the field.
"She is one of the most visible and pro
ductive young researchers in the field of
wireless communications, and she is an out
standing teacher .is well. I lei research lies at
the coie ol modern electrical engineering,"
Wooley said.
" I let work is distinguished not onl\ by its

exiraordihai \ breadth, but also b) her excep
tional ability to bridge theory and practice."
Goldsmith came to Stanford in January
I 999, aftei five years as an assistant professor
•it Caltech. Before joining Caltech in 1994,
she completed .« doc torate in electrical engi
neering at I'C-Berkeley.
Dai has been an assistant professor at
Stanford for font years. He- received a doc
torate at Harvard.
Twenty-six Sloan Fellows have gone on to
receive Nobel Prizes later in their careers.
