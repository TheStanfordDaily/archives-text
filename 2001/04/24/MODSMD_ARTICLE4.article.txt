customers.
The concept of improved cus
tomer efficiency will also be reflect
ed in the dishwashing system, food
preparation, receiving and storage
areas, and the manager's office.
The Wilbur kitchen renovation
will take place in two stages. The
first stage will include the demoli
tion of me current kitchen and ser

vice areas to create a conteinpo
rarv, colorful and student-fi iendh
environment. Everett s.iid. New
food production equipment w ill be
added to support a larger volume
of customers.

At this stage, the manager's of
fice, the dishwashing system and
the receiving and storage areas will
be redesigned for efficient and
easy access:
The second stage will restore
the dining rooms with a new coat
of paint and new carpeting.
1 he basic design of the dining
rooms will be preserved, and the
platforms located at adjacent
ends of the dining room will be
refurbished.
I he platforms will be redone
with wood and track lighting to
provide a stage for special pro
grains. After the refurbishment,

the dining rooms w ill he equipped
to host special events. Residential
Education programs and late
night studving.
Students expressed interest
about the upcoming changes.
Freshman Chiara Cortez alludes
to the supposedly low quality of
food seen at the Wilbur kitchen.
"Although 1 think breakfast is
pretty good. 1 know a lot of my
Branner mates who used to eat [at
Wilbur] on weekends complained
a lot about the dinner food."
Freshman Tiffany Li is opti
mistic about the renovation.
"The renovation will hopefully
improve the food in terms of fresh
ness and accessibility."
Constructed nearly 50 years
ago in 19. p )(i, Wilbur Hall has never
undergone a comprehensive
kitchen renovation.

Dining room serverv upgrades,
however, have been made on a
limited scale since the opening of
the building.
The upcoming renovation
serves two main purposes: im
provement in overall customer sat
isfaction and reduction of opera
tional and maintenance costs.
According to Everett. Housing
and Dining Services plans to im
prove customer satisfaction by
upgrading the dining rooms,
kitchen and serveries to provide
an attractive a la carte market
place concept for food prepara
tion and delivery.
Operational and maintenance
costs will be reduced in the long
term by correcting, upgrading
and replacing existing equipment
and systems.
A more efficient production

ami service layout will also lower
operating costs In reducing food
costs .uul allowing the kitchen stall
to work more efficiently.
Like the Stern Hall kitchen,
the Wilbur kitchen will be de
signed bv Webb Design and reno
vated by Vance Brown Construc
tion Company.
These two companies were cho
sen because of their "familiarity
with the food service environment
and their excellent work on the
Stern Hall kitchen and serverv
renovation, completed last fall."
Everett said.
Like last year's Stern renovation
project, the Wilbur renovation
project will "completely renovate
and reconfigure the flood service
areas in Wilbur Hall to meet c ur
rent trends in food service,"
Everett said.

Students expressed interest
about the upcoming changes.
Freshman Chiara Cortez alludes
to the supposedly low quality of
food seen at the Wilbur kitchen.

pretty good. 1 know a lot of my

Wilbur] on weekends complained
a lot about the dinner food."
Freshman Tiffany Li is opti

Constructed nearly 50 years
ago in 19. p )(i, Wilbur Hall has never
undergone a comprehensive
kitchen renovation.

Dining room serverv upgrades,
however, have been made on a
limited scale since the opening of
the building.
The upcoming renovation
serves two main purposes: im
provement in overall customer sat
isfaction and reduction of opera
tional and maintenance costs.
According to Everett. Housing
and Dining Services plans to im
prove customer satisfaction by
upgrading the dining rooms,
kitchen and serveries to provide
an attractive a la carte market
place concept for food prepara
tion and delivery.
Operational and maintenance
costs will be reduced in the long
term by correcting, upgrading
and replacing existing equipment
and systems.
A more efficient production

ami service layout will also lower
operating costs In reducing food
costs .uul allowing the kitchen stall
to work more efficiently.
Like the Stern Hall kitchen,
the Wilbur kitchen will be de
signed bv Webb Design and reno
vated by Vance Brown Construc
tion Company.
These two companies were cho
sen because of their "familiarity
with the food service environment
and their excellent work on the
Stern Hall kitchen and serverv
renovation, completed last fall."
Everett said.
Like last year's Stern renovation
project, the Wilbur renovation
project will "completely renovate
and reconfigure the flood service
areas in Wilbur Hall to meet c ur
rent trends in food service,"
Everett said.
