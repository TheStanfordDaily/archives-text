# Incinerator causes controversy
## Operator, student environmental groups disagree over effect on environment, area residents 
### SUSAN TIEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
( Controversy continues to surround the numera
tion ol medical waste at Oakland-based Integrated
Knvironmental Systems, the only commercial med
ical waste itu inerator in (California. C Critics charge that
the incinerator emits excessive amounts of dioxin, a
chemical that has been linked to an increased risk of
cancer and birth delects, in an area primarily popu
lated by the poor and minorities. ()ttit ialsat I IS. how
ever, insist that the incinerator does not have any Mg
nilicant eflect on the environment or the health of
area residents.
Recently, Stanford I lospital joined the IKS Reusable
Sharps C Container Pit)gram, a recycling program devel
oped and licensed by IKS. Under this program, svringe

from medical waste that will be incinerated.
I he containers are made out of polyvinyl chloride,
which releases dioxin when it is burned. B\ recycling

Jim Bateman, general manager of IKS, pointed to
the recycling program as proof of IKS's dedication to
the environment. "The positive environmental im

Hateman rejected environmental groups' criti-

( isms of IKS. " I licv ilimk that we air one of!lit* lead
ing producers of dioxin in the area, but there is n<:
sound scientific hat kground for that," he said.
"We have .1 (lean plant, and we operate ii safely,'
s.iid IKS spokesman Jav Silverburg. "We won't put up
with people who will push out incorrect information
about our plant."
In response to the criticism that its tlioxin emis
sions endanger public health, IKS points to evi
dence ih.it its emissions are far below state and fed
eral standards.
A IW9 report by the Bay Area air quality regulatot
found that I KS s tlioxin emissions are approximateh
10 times lowet than the permitted levels. 1 his statistit
does not account for uncontrolled tlioxin emissions
which <Hi in tim ing .i bvpass when the plant's emis

constantly, however, the report
aava IKS "emita leaadioxin than it in
permitted to emit."
"The available inhumation in

do not pone a significant health i ink
to the community," the air ivgula

Student!* lor Knvironmental Ac -
tion at Stanford, however, arguea
that moat of the regulator* eati
matea of dioxin emiaaiona "are ex
tivmely uncertain, with atandard
error* of an order ol magnitude or
more," according to junior l«a«
vanva C.hekuru.
In rcHponae to IKS'a atatement
that it eontrihutca comparatively
little dioxin in the llav Area,
(.hckuru aaid IKS'a emiaaiona are
not spread uniformly throughout
the Hav Aira.

"Rather, they are concentrated
in the neighborhoods near the in
cincrator and in the paths of'pre
vailing winds. , . East Oakland
residents still stiller disproportion-
from the incinerator's emis
sions," she said.
Overall, M AS objects to the in

(or a very small proportion ol med
ical waste that must be burned
nuclei state law, Instead, SKAS
supports the use oi methods like
autociaving and mic rowaving,
which do not produce diuxin.

"There is simply no reason to con
tinue the hazardous practice of
hulk medical waste incineration,"
C.hekuru said.
Activint?* and incinerator ol!i
-( iaN also disagree about whether
the poor and minorities ate dis
proportionately aMected by the
incinerator.
According to Silverhurg, IKS
cannot he accused of environmen
tal disc rimination because Census
data indicates that the neighbor
hood closest to the inciucrator has
the highest per c apita income in

the East Hay.
Ilateman a ho denies (lie
charges of environmental racism,
"Since we don't believe that we
have any negative environmental
impact, we don't believe that we
have any disparate a fleet on
member!! of the community,"
Ilateman said.
in response, C.hekuni noted
that "( '.emu* /ones arc frequently
too 1)1^... to accurately portray
socioeconomic statu* of neighbor
hoods and communities."
through their interactions with

the people living near the inciner
ator, members of SKAS say they
are convinced that the incinerator
is having adverse health effects.
"We have talked to community
members and visited hearings
where they voiced their con
terns," Chekuru said. "Mothers
complained of their kids being
sick oflen and having lung prob
lems. We don't have statistics on
this [problem], but this is what we
learned from our interactions
with community members and
their experience,"
