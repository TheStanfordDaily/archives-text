( Controversy continues to surround the numera
tion ol medical waste at Oakland-based Integrated
Knvironmental Systems, the only commercial med
ical waste itu inerator in (California. C Critics charge that
the incinerator emits excessive amounts of dioxin, a
chemical that has been linked to an increased risk of
cancer and birth delects, in an area primarily popu
lated by the poor and minorities. ()ttit ialsat I IS. how
ever, insist that the incinerator does not have any Mg

area residents.
Recently, Stanford I lospital joined the IKS Reusable

from medical waste that will be incinerated.
I he containers are made out of polyvinyl chloride,

Jim Bateman, general manager of IKS, pointed to
the recycling program as proof of IKS's dedication to
the environment. "The positive environmental im

"We have .1 (lean plant, and we operate ii safely,'

In response to the criticism that its tlioxin emis

A IW9 report by the Bay Area air quality regulatot
