1933
On April 25, 19IW, I lie* D.nK printed .111 article
about tlu* Stanford (.onvalesc cut I lonic.
" 1 'least', Miss Nurse, could I have some more of
those trees?' said a < rippled little inmate of the Stan
lord Convalescent Home when he had scraped the
last morsel of food from off his first dinner plate there.
"'You don't mean 'trees,' the nurse replied.
' 1 hat's c auliflower.'
" I lie little kid looked pu//led, but how was he to
know, he said to himself. It was the first time he had ever
seen the stuff, and it looked more like trees than any
thing else he had ever seen. I le could have seconds' if
he wanted them. |nst a dream come true.
"Miss Margaret Spande. head of the home, told
lots of stories like that when she showed members of
c ampus committees through the plant yesterday."
Bottom line: Makes you wonder if young "inmates" at Hie
Medical Center still enjoy cauliflower as much as this one did.
