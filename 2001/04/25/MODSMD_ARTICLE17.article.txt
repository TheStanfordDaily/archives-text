space sliuttle astronauts floated outside
vesterda\ and hooked up cables that
sent powei coursing through the inter
national spate station's new fiS-foot
robot arm.

11 at 11 it'll I managed to get both power
lines working, after slaving ovei table

"I lip. hip, hoora\." the spacewalkeis

came to life. Applause filled the rot nil at
Mission (lontrol.

two-handed construction crane that is
neetled to finish building the spate sta

and running in case one tailed.
I hat wasn't theonlv problem tim ing
the spacewalk, whit h lasted 7 1 2 hours,
an hour longei than planned.
\ i ( )imet tot came apart in I latlfield's
hands after he i enioved an old rat I it) an
tenna from the space station, and the
tap floated into a berthing port. I le
could not reach the piece. "II onl\ there
was someone out here with long arms,"
lie said.

1 -iter, the petals of the port were
opened one In one, in hopes the (ap
would flo.u out. 1 ike i lot of things in

sible cornet and won't come out until
it n i each .11 ad field reported.
NASA of lit ials said the - metal c an —
about the size of a stack of seven quar
ters — could interfere when the next
space station piece is attached to tli.tt
berthing port in two months. "There
are going to be a lot of disc ussions about
that in the coming cla\s because it is a
concei n," said John Curry, the lead sta
tion flight director.
Hadficld also had trouble removing

a \ ideo signal < onverter from the {lack
ing < i .idle for the robot arm. I le turned
the release bolt 2(> times, 15 times more
than he was supposed to. and still the
convertei would not come off. He had
to give up on that, too.
During a spacewalk on Sunday,
Para/vnski and Hadficld installed the
robot arm on a temporary mount on
space station Alpha. One of the arm's
hands let go of that mount Monday and
reached over and damped down on a
power and control socket 24 feet away,
its base foi the next year. 1 he space-
VN.ilkers connected four cables at the
socket yesterday, to provide not onlv
power to the arm but computer data
and video.
Power began flowing through the
priniar\ routing as soon as Para/.ynski
hooked it up. But the backup power cir
(ilit remained dead until I'ara/vnski
and Hadficld disconnected and then
reattached the cable hookups on both
ends. NASA suspects one of the connec
tors was not bolted down tightly during
the last shuttle mission.
"It took a little- longer and we sort of
went into extra innings, but we came
out ahead in the end." said shuttle flight
director Phil Engelauf.
With the problem finally solved,
space station residents Jim Voss and
Susan Helms commanded the robot
ai in to release itself from the temporary
mount. I hat hand, now free, continued
toclutc It the 3,000-pound packing crate,
or pallet, that the arm was launched in.
"It's beautiful to see the Big Arm
moving the pallet around," Canadian
1 ladfield said of the Canadian-built arm.
"Big relief."
I he robot arm will hand the crate to
space shuttle Endeavour's smaller robot
arm on Wednesday, and the crate will be
returned to Earth next week. Its fust big
workout will be to attach a pressure
(liambei for future spacewalkers, due to
arrive it) June.
