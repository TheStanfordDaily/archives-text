## The 						Stanford Daily Communication key to successful presidency 
### 
Published Since IX9I

-y- EARLY A YEAR has passed since
lilt* University appointed John
Hennessy as former University
JL President C.erhard Casper's suc
cessor. A great deal has happened over the
past year, including t lit* introduction of the
Campaign for Undergraduate Education,
the announcement of a possible merger of
departments and an incident involving hate
graffiti. Hennessy has indeed faced signifi
cant challenges ih.it would present difficulty
to anyone in his position. However, if there
is one theme that seems to run throughout
his handling of these events, it is a lac k of
communication with students. It is essential
that, iu the coming years, our University
president does his best to remove the veil ot
confusion that has surrounded most of the
past year's events and focus more on stu
dents' thoughts, needs and input, both di
rectly and indirectly.
Perhaps the most prominent concern ol
students and faculty over the past few
months has been Hennessy's commitment
to the humanities. 11 ic incredible amount of
attention the University has given to the
hard sciences has caused concern in recent
years. To combat this harmful trend, Hen
nessy promised in his October inaugural
speech to address the inequity in resource
distribution. But some of his actions and

suggestions over the last year have at least
partially contradicted this claim. I'he pro
posed merger of six departments into the
Department of Languages, Cultures and
Literatures — ostensibly to cut administra
tive costs — has led to frustration among
many in the I niversitv community who al
ready feel overwhelmed by the Silicon Val
ley technological atmosphere.
Indeed, Hennessy needs to be more
forthright in responding to these under
standable concerns; students have even
publicly protested the merger, but have re
ceived little, if any, University response. The
fact that this proposal was made with what
many argue was insufficient faculty and stu
dent input further distanced the adminis
tration from those concerned with the fu
ture of the humanities. This merger is still
only a possibility, but Hennessy must now
step back, listen to w hat is being said and re
evaluate- the proposal.
In the same vein, students have voiced
concern over the selection of Hewlett-
Packard ( liief Executive ()flicer (larlv I- ior
ina as this year s Commencement speaker.
Fiorina's achievements aside, it was trou
bling that Hennessy seemed to pay little at
tention to the suggestions and yotes of stu
dents, stating that, essentially, the choice was
his .is University president. Indeed it was.

However, as Commencement is .1 day for
graduating students and their families,
Hennessy should have better communicat
ed with tlieni in the selection process. Stu
dents would find it much easier to celebrate
the c hoice of Fiorina had the process been
more transparent.
In light of the discovery of racist graffiti in
several University buildings at the end of
March, it also became evident just how quiet
1 lennessy has been as president of the Uni
versity. ()ne would think that a crime as of
fensive and harmful as hate graffiti would
elicit a powerful response from the Univer
sity, especially from the president. But
rather than immediately releasing a state
ment that strongly condemned such ac ts of
hate and racism, Hennessy spoke briefly
and then let lower administrators handle
the rest. One of the highest priorities of a
university president is to make sure that ev
eryone feels safe and comfortable in their
community, but. In neglecting to take a
hard-line approach to these hate crimes,
I lennessy failed nianv members of the Stan
ford community.
I "his does not mean, however, that Hen
nessy has not attempted to address the needs
of students. Bv introducing the S1 -billion
Campaign for Undergraduate Education in
()c tober, I lennessy made a strong and com

mendable statement about his commitment
to the University's youngest students.
I lowever, I lennessv should focus on con
tinually updating the University communi
ty on the status of the campaign. After the
initial applause settled down, we haven't
heard much else on the matter. Because the
goal of this campaign is to benefit under
graduates, I lennessv should let students
know how ii is progressing. ()penness, as al
ways, would be appreciated.
The problem is simple. Hennessy has a
great deal of plans and ideas to enhance the
quality of academics and life and Stanford,
but he often fails to communicate these with
students and faculty — whose own plans
and ideas may not always mesh with his own.
1 lennessv has proved in the past that he is ca
pable of strong communication. As dean of
engineering, students and faculty compli
mented 1 lennessy's openness and approach
abilitv. I lis success in the business world cer
tainlv also speaks to his ability to listen and
effectively communicate. A reintroduction of
the open relationship between students, fac
ulty and the president will promote a better
University atmosphere and perhaps com
mand more respect for the president's initia
tives. We hope that, in the future, Hennessy
will in.ike a concerted effort to renew his
dedication to open and positive leadership.

Published Since IX9I

-y- EARLY A YEAR has passed since
lilt* University appointed John
Hennessy as former University
JL President C.erhard Casper's suc
cessor. A great deal has happened over the
past year, including t lit* introduction of the
Campaign for Undergraduate Education,
the announcement of a possible merger of
departments and an incident involving hate
graffiti. Hennessy has indeed faced signifi
cant challenges ih.it would present difficulty
to anyone in his position. However, if there
is one theme that seems to run throughout
his handling of these events, it is a lac k of
communication with students. It is essential
that, iu the coming years, our University
president does his best to remove the veil ot
confusion that has surrounded most of the
past year's events and focus more on stu
dents' thoughts, needs and input, both di
rectly and indirectly.
Perhaps the most prominent concern ol
students and faculty over the past few
months has been Hennessy's commitment
to the humanities. 11 ic incredible amount of
attention the University has given to the
hard sciences has caused concern in recent
years. To combat this harmful trend, Hen
nessy promised in his October inaugural
speech to address the inequity in resource
distribution. But some of his actions and

suggestions over the last year have at least
partially contradicted this claim. I'he pro
posed merger of six departments into the
Department of Languages, Cultures and
Literatures — ostensibly to cut administra
tive costs — has led to frustration among
many in the I niversitv community who al
ready feel overwhelmed by the Silicon Val
ley technological atmosphere.
Indeed, Hennessy needs to be more
forthright in responding to these under
standable concerns; students have even
publicly protested the merger, but have re
ceived little, if any, University response. The
fact that this proposal was made with what
many argue was insufficient faculty and stu
dent input further distanced the adminis
tration from those concerned with the fu
ture of the humanities. This merger is still
only a possibility, but Hennessy must now
step back, listen to w hat is being said and re
evaluate- the proposal.
In the same vein, students have voiced
concern over the selection of Hewlett-
Packard ( liief Executive ()flicer (larlv I- ior
ina as this year s Commencement speaker.
Fiorina's achievements aside, it was trou
bling that Hennessy seemed to pay little at
tention to the suggestions and yotes of stu
dents, stating that, essentially, the choice was
his .is University president. Indeed it was.

However, as Commencement is .1 day for
graduating students and their families,
Hennessy should have better communicat
ed with tlieni in the selection process. Stu
dents would find it much easier to celebrate
the c hoice of Fiorina had the process been
more transparent.
In light of the discovery of racist graffiti in
several University buildings at the end of
March, it also became evident just how quiet
1 lennessy has been as president of the Uni
versity. ()ne would think that a crime as of
fensive and harmful as hate graffiti would
elicit a powerful response from the Univer
sity, especially from the president. But
rather than immediately releasing a state
ment that strongly condemned such ac ts of
hate and racism, Hennessy spoke briefly
and then let lower administrators handle
the rest. One of the highest priorities of a
university president is to make sure that ev
eryone feels safe and comfortable in their
community, but. In neglecting to take a
hard-line approach to these hate crimes,
I lennessy failed nianv members of the Stan
ford community.
