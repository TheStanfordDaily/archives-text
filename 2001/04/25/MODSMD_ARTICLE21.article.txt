# LET FRIEDOM RING
## Don't tutor, adopt a Weenie 
### 
Zimbabwe. There! 1 always
wanted to see what a Z would
look like in big font. Anyway,
on with the column.
I bis weekend, 1 got a chance to hang
out with my brother, Shawn, and his
girlfriend, Heather. It's wonderful that
they live in the area and th.it we can visit
each other frequently. Unfortunately,
the reason they live so close is a painful
one. They are freshmen .it Cal.
What is this mysterious "Cal" to
which I refer? Let me explain.
Superman has Lex Luther, and Bat
man has The |oker —everv superhero
has an archenemy, (lore had Bush, and
now Bush has the English language —
every politician has a nemesis. 1 he Lak
ers have the Blazers, and the Golden
State Warriors have themselves — every
team has a foe. Accordingly, every
school has a rival. Harvard has Yale.
Michigan has Ohio State.
And we have Cal. The Cardinal vs.
the Golden Bears. Private vs. public.
Palo Alto vs. Berkeley. Hoover Tower
(girth) vs. The Campanile (length).
For the 85 percent of us who aren't
athletes, this "rivalry" business may be
news. Stanford students don't seem
very concerned with th.u institution
across the Bay. Perhaps the decline of
Cal athletics has put a damper on our
loathing, but we simply don't think
about them much anymore. F.ven the BO
admits in my dorm — who have since
departed in a whirlwind of braces and
acne — didn't inquire about the status
of our rivalry.
However, every time I see Shawn and
Heather, our conversation inevitably
turns to comparison and debate. Stan
ford is too sterile; UC-Berkeley is too
big. Stanford's tuition isn't a good value;
UC-Berkeley's dorm food is inedible.
The discussion goes on and on.

So why does Stanford
vs. Cal consume our
conversations when I
never talk about Cal
with Stanford friends?
Well. 1 have a theorv.
I (,-Bei kele\ kuls suffer
from what I like to (.ill
Sudden Underdog or
Nemesis syndrome
(SUN syndrome).

I he psychology of the SUN s\ n
drome is understandable with some ex
planation. Imagine you emerge from
high school, the most successful four
years of vour life, and wind up .it I C-
Berkelev. You begin vour studies .it the
nation's premier public university, and
you feel unstoppable.
I lowever. everyone around you seems
to ignore your new school. 1 hev are ob
sessed with disparaging this other college
40 miles away . I hev tell you (and these
misconceptions have been confirmed In
my brother) that students at "Stanfurd"
get As just for showing up to the final.
They tell you that all "Stanfurd" fresh
men were complete nerds in high school
.ind never had fun. (1 hat one's wiy off).
They tell you that "Stanfurd" students
are rolling in money, spending cash with
reckless abandon in Palo Alto (which
some believe means "the bubble" in
Spanish). They tell vou to scream obsc cn
ities at the Yahoo! advertisement in your
very own Haas Pavilion because the com
pany was started In "Stanfurd" grads.
And the oldest of your peers, the fburth
.uul fifth-year seniors, complain inces
santly that your institution of learning
hasn't beaten "Stanfurd" in football or
men's basketball in all the years they've
been around.
After only a few weeks of exposure to
this endless diatribe. SUN syndrome
kicks in. Suddenly, you feel like a disre

sported underdog. "Stanford," a plate
\<>u ma> never liave visited, becomes
vour hated eneniv and ultimate neme
sis. It consumes vour thoughts and does
a backward two-and-a-half flying crane
kick to vour senses.
Intercstinglv. Shawn has not let the
SI N syndrome overcome him entirelv.
For one. maintaining a serious relation
ship. mixed in with a tew classes, has
kept him quite busv. But, more impor
tantlv, since he visits me even now and
then, Shawn has access to something
most I'('-Berkeley students trv to
avoid — an ac tual Stanford student. M \
a< cessibilit\ allows him to dellect the
downpour of Stanford mvths raining in
from all angles. I am his umbrella from
ih< SI N.
But my brother is one of the lucky
few. There is no need for the majoritv ot
C '.al students to sutler from the SI N svn
drotne. We can help.
Stanford students who want to volun
teer their time and energv must reach
bevond Fast Palo Alto. I hose little third
graders tan wait; the Bav Area h.is col
lege students with more serious prob
lems. In the spirit of California's suc
cessful Adopt-a-Highway Program, it's
time tor us to adopt a Weenie.
1 urge von to brave the trenches of
L'C-Berkelev to find a voting Weenie
who needs a mentor. The satisfaction vou
will glean from vour efforts pales in com
parison to the positive e fleet vou w ill have
on .1 life in peril. If you lose vour wav, |ust
remember the Adopt-a-Weenie credo: "A
Stanford student without sunscreen is
pleasantlv pink, but a C.al student without
a SUN-brella is dangerous."
Josh Fried, a senior majoring in comparative
literature. thanks Shawn anil Heather for
their input. // you would like to adopt a Wee
nie, e-mail /fried ((istanford.edu.
