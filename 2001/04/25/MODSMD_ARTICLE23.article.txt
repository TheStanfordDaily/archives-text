Athletics Department 'enjoyed
renaissance without scandal'
As I read Tuesday's editorial ("Athletics
Department too strong, independent") 011
the strength ot the Athletics Department. I
was struck In how two-faced it was. In other
words, the piece seemed to say, "We reali/e
how great our Athletic s Department hasbe
come, and. nothing truly bad has happened
yet. but, hey, here's hoping something will."
Maybe Tom Watson's sole contribution
to the college he loves is that golf course,
and maybe it sail he cares about. I, for one,
know that my senior year .it Stanford
would have been infmitelv less cnjovable
had there not been such an outstanding
course where I could plav tor peanuts. Re
member that while that course gets a lot of
care, attention and maylx* even coddling,
students ( .111 plav there tor significantly less
than they would have to pay at any com
parable course 011 this planet. And, if Tom
Watson wants to throw a fit over it, well
then that's his right. It's his money.
Athletics and academics do have a sym
biotic relationship on America's campuses,
and I don't think there is .1 better example
of how to make it work properly than Stan
tord. Fhe fact that thev have become inde

pendent makes them unique really, espe
cially if you examine some of this country's
state-run institutions, where politics and
bureaucracy get involved in the equation,
and all sorts of abuses oci in, on both sides
of the fence.
Stanford is one of the richest universi
ties in the world, and its Athletics Depart
ment has enjoyed a renaissance without
scandal. Is it at .ill possible that you're
bored and just try ing to muckrake? Don
Kennedy raised a billion dollars with
crummy teams during his tenure, so I
doubt very seriously that the Athletics De
partment is going to take over as some sort
of 500-pound gorilla that can't be moved.
If the scandal of the day is that the scandal
free Athletics Department is making more
money than ever for one of the finest aca
demic institutions on the planet, then the
world's in a lot better shape than I
thought. \\ hv don't you spend more time
with your toes in the C.law soaking up
some spring sun. and then take a bag of
peanuts down to Sunken Diamond and
catch some future major leaguers? You'll
lx- glad you did.
