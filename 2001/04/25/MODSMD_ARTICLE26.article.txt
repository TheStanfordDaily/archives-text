baseball came to dominate both the acade
mic and social facets of his life, Guthrie
looked ahead to a Mormon mission to
Spain 111 at he had planned well in advance
ot his decision to play tor the Cougars.
"B\ the end [ot the season], 1 was reach
to leave and goon my mission," he said. "It
was just a big c hange [from high school],
and 1 was thinking about other things."
He would continue to think about
everything but baseball toi two vears with
out returning home from Spain even
once. Near the end ot his time abroad, his
parents sent him a letter asking, on a
whim, about Ins interest in attending Stan
ford instead of returning to BYl : .
"1 had everything lined up to go back to
BYU," Guthrie said. "1 had m\ room, 1
had my letters with the coach, and that was
my intention .ill the wav until April."
With some proactive parenting and
more help from his high school coach, the
Cardinal coaching statf became aware of
Guthrie's interest in Stanford and dec ided
to pursue the opportunity.
"Coach [Dean] Slot/, was the blood

hound on that one," said pitching coach
Tom Kutiis. "We didn't know if
[Guthrie's] non-fastball stuff was going to
be effective at all, but we knew he had a
good arm."
The school notified Guthrie that he had
been accepted in May, and, upon his re
turn to ()regon, he discussed the possibili
ty of transferring schools with BYU's new
head coach and with Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess.
"Had there been the same coach [at
BYI | as before, 1 may have felt more loy
ally to come back," Guthrie said. "But the
whole situation was a little different there.
1 felt that plaving at Stanford was a great
opportunity that I couldn't pass up."
After he and his family made the dec i
sion that he would transfer, Guthrie had
just one thing left to do: Find out if he
could still throw. Upon his return in June,
he began to lift weights once again and
slowly work his arm back into shape after
its 24-month layoff.
As the Cardinal reported for tall ball in
September, (iutlu ie stepped onto a mound
tor the first time in more than two years.
"1 felt weak," he said. "1 didn't feel like
1 liacl much, but I just hoped that it would
come back slowly."
kunis begs to differ.

"Jeremy Guthrie came in with a lot of
skills, and he's just polishing them now,"
lie said.
With junior Mike Gosling's early-sea
son injury, Marquess tin list Guthrie to the
top ot the Cardinal rotation and the 21-
year-old sophomore produced immediate
results. It is ama/ing that the combination

ot being .1 complete unknown, inactive for
two straight years, without any history ot
particularly unique ability has led him to
an 8-2 record and a mind-numbing 1.69
KRA as Stanford's Friday night starter
thus far.
" There wasn't a lot of competition in
Spain," Guthrie said. "That can work two

ways. It can scare you ott from competition
or it can make it that much more exciting
for you.
"1 think one of the best parts is to come
back and see it as a challenge. That's
helped me to work harder to achieve more
than I had in the past."
Guthrie has parlayed a fastball that ex
plodes with late movement, an excellent
curve, a hard-breaking slider and a tricky
change-up into victories against the na
tion's most difficult schedule.
"Even time he steps on the mound,
he's going to give von a set of" pitches you
can work with," Kunis said.
Because his age enables professional
teams to draft Ins rights in | une's upcom
ing amateur draft, Guthrie could be
packing his bags yet again within two
months. Guthrie said he has not vet dis
cussed the possibility of leaving Stanford
earlv with his parents, but plans to do so
in the coming weeks.
Even without the pressures of the draft,
June should have enough excitement to
keep Guthrie busy. He will marry his girl
friend on June 20. four days after the Col
lege World Series championship game.
It Guthrie continues his unexpected
dominance on the hill, what a honeymoon
his wedding could be.
