• ins . !' vet- ; .in pitcher
kirsten Yogt, who is known to smile 011 the
rubber.
"Yogt is notorious tor smiling on the
mound," said senior Ramona Shelburne.
"Allister always smiles when sin- is on the
field, whether she is at kit <m iiehind the
plate. 11 turned into a kind (>f smiling war."
fhe smile that Allister's teammates
think ac tually might be her facial expres
sion tor concentration does not leave
when she steps off the field.
Allister beams when talking about het
life- off the field at the Farm.
"Stanford is an ama/ing place," Allis
ter said. "It's like a dream. There is not
supposed to be a place like this. It is the
greatest academic atmosphere, and the
athletics are ama/ing. I mean, it's |iist un
paralleled. You have places like the Ivvs,

with academics that are just as good, or
places like I CL\, whose athletics are just
as good as well, but there is nothing even
close to the combination that we have
here, and 1 think that it's really special."
After singing the University's praises,
Allister's true Cardinal colors shine
through, and she cites the band run as one
of her best memories so tar at Stanford.
"I reallv liked the band run on the first
night." Allister said. "1 thought th.it was
just ama/ing. It was so much fun. You are
• just running around, vou don't know any
of these other people. You have just met
vour dorminates. I here are crazy people
everywhere."
Allister also raves about the freshman
dorm experience.
"1 love it so much. I think lots of ath
letes tend to get stuck with their team and
not reallv hangout with their dorms," Al
lister s.ud. "But, if you get to know the
people m vour dorm, it's reallv a great ex
perience. It's nice to have people from

different backgrounds."
But Allister's love tor dorm lite and
Stanford lite would not be complete with
out softball.
"I couldn't imagine going to school
without it," Allister said. "It fills something
that I need with my competitive spirit."
Her competitive spirit is what drives
her, her positive attitude is what inspires
those around her, and her goal is one she
shares with her team.
"1 really want to win a national cham
pionship," Allister said. "We have played
everyone, and we can do it. We've played
No. 1 UCLA, and we beat them. We
played Arizona, they beat us, but we
know we're there . . . We have played the
best, and we are there competing. My
go.il is just tor us to string it .til together .it
the end and just show everyone that
Stanford is tor real. This year, we are re
ally going to do it."
And that is exactly what Allister is
doing — with a smile.


Freshman catcher Jessica Allister has proven to be a solid addition to the Stanford softball team be
hind home plate this year. The only problem is that her catcher's mask usually hides her smile.
