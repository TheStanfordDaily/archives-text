"Acting cautiously was definitely the right
thing to do."
Beginning last vear. the Admissions Office
put the guidelines for Admit Weekend partic
ipants in writing, in order to ensure that
prospective students and their parents under
stood Stanford's expectations before coming
for the weekend.
According to I Van of Admissions and Fi

and the excitation that all students will abide
by those standards, and include language
about behavior related to the use of alcohol
while visiting."

with the standards depend on the situation,
but range from a warning or being sent home
to the withdrawal of admission. To date, the
Admissions Office has not revoked any letters
of admission.
Understanding th.it prospective students
were not allowed to drink, house hosts plan
ning dorm events were forced to "put more ef
fort into other events [that did not involve
drinking]," said Branner co-head house host
freshman Sagar Chandaria.
In Branner, house hosts planned a casino
night for prospective students with card
games, music, raffles and exotic, non-alcoholic
drinks.
"We had to try to create events where alco
hol was not the most important issue. We tried
to twist the drinks so that they were exotic, but
contained no alcohol," Chandaria said. " Hie
event was better without alcohol."
"I had fun anyway," said prospective stu
dent Raina Mahajan.
"There were a lot of good activities
planned, and you could go w here you wanted
whenever you wanted to. Meeting the people
who are going to be in my class was the best
part, though."
