## E-mail upgrade protects student identities 
### LUSAN CHUA 
"Dear Stanford Student:
Our records indicate that you have l>een checking
your Leland e-mail in a way that gives hat kers a chance
to steal your password."
\ ou may have received a similar e-mail from the Se
cure Computing Campaign. Perhaps the ominous tone
of this message inspired a little bit of anxiety. But. being
<i busy Stanford student, you probably sent that mes
sage straight to the recycle bin.
And, then, you may have received another message,
explaining that your refusal to install PC-Leland could
create vulnerabilities for the entire Stanford computer
network. This might have inspired some guilt, and pei -
haps a sense of responsibility. But the chances are that
you ignored this one. too. After all, the stereotypical
hacker infiltrates the Pentagon or steals billion-dollai
trade secrets — why would the\ lie interested in voui
silly old SD Net ID?
According to Stanford Computer Security Officer
Stephen Hansen, a hacker with an active imagination
could cause quite a bit of mischief with your 1 eland
password. To begin, this person would have access to
your e-mail account, allowing her to send am number
of harassing messages to your friends, classmates and
or professors under your name. She would have ac cess
to any personal information you might have in vour e

mail account.
She could alter or destro\ anv files that you might
have stored on the network — for example, a per-

sonal Web site. And. il she cap
tured your personal identifica
tion number as well, she could
log into vour Axess account,
opening up a virtual Pandora's
box of sensitive, personally
identifiable information, in
cluding vour phone number,
permanent mailing address,
place of birth — and, most im
portantly, vour Social Security
Number.
A Social SecuritN Number
might not seem like top-secret in
formation, but these nine digits
can be a tool tot .1 hacker to com
mit the traditional crime <>t iden
tic theft.
In .1 typical identitx theft case,
someone uses your social securi
ty number and other bits of per-

son.il information to opt-n a bank account or .ip|>l\ lot
.1 credit card in your name, then she goes on a shop
ping spree, leaving vou responsible tor large amounts
ot debt. And. even it the hacker is caught, vou can be
plagued with a false history ot bad credit that could pre
sent barriers when vou apply tor loans, bu\ a c at . rent

an apartment 01 even interview fora job.
I lie Federal Trade Commission recently reported
that neai K !i() percent of iclentitx theft cases occur to

\ ictims in our age group. In
a recent case, one college
student's former friend
opened five bank accounts
under her name, wrote 150
bad checks, bought four
pieces of property and
racked up traffic violations
that went on her driving
record.
Unfortunately, the
court system does not pro
vide verv much relief fora
victim of identity theft. ('.ur
rent U.S. law provides
stronger remedies for iden
tity theft asa criminal, rather
than a ci\ il. violation (mean
ing that a hacker could be
sent to jail, but you might
not get vour money back).

1 he Identity I lull and Assumption Deterrence Act
makes identic theft a fedeial c rime with penalties that
c an include a 1 j-yeai pi ison sentence and a tine.
A hac kei might also he ( barged imdei federal laws
that prohibit computet fraud. ()n a state level. theCal
iforma Penal (lode imposes penalties fbi using per

sonul information tor "am unlawful pm pose, includ
ing to obtain credit, goods. services 01 medical infor
mation in the name of another person." However,
none of these statutes pro\ ide .tin t\ pe of 1 emed\ foi
the victim.
Under federal law, victims of credit and hanking
fraud are general!) onh liable for the first $50 of loss
I fowever, cleat ing your name and ct edit ie< * >rd (an be
a lengthy and expensive process itself, and these losses
are not included in this waivei.
Bringing a hacker to court to seek restitution or
reimbursement for voui expenses t an prove to be a
daunting task. The victim tvpicalh would need to
present a police report, a chronological record of
events, credit reports, telephone records and a
record of the overall costs incut red. Also, the c bailees
of winning in court are not (ei tain beiause tradition
al law does not recogni/e identit\ as a personal or
property interest that should be protected from
wrongful conduct.
In short, identitx theft is not a legal problem that a
victim c an c|inc klv and effect ivel\ resolve.
Although i becking e-mail msec ureh probabh won't
bring the downfall of the entire network, World Wai
111 or a life time of bad credit liiston. it might be a good
idea to use l'('.-I.eland, just in cast
