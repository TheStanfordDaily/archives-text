### VINAY TRIPATHI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
He's so flush with cash that he
bought a professional basketball
team tor himself as a toy. Broad
cast .com founder and Dallas Mav
ericks owner Mark Cuban spoke

in Bishop Auditori
um at the Graduate
School ot Business
on April 16.
Cuban's speech
focused on his basic
strategies and rules
for starting and run
ning a successful
business, and he illus
trated his concepts by
describing his per
sonal experiences
with Broadcast.com
and the Mavericks.
Cuban began by
explaining how he
founded Broad
cast.com in 1995, a
company that was
one of the first to
transmit streaming
multimedia over
the Internet. A
graduate of 1 ndiana
University and a
se 1 112 - p roc 1 a i m ed
rabid Indiana bas
ketball fan, Cuban
and other alumni
had no way to listen
to games when they
lived iti Dallas.
"So we started in a
little house 1 had, and
I went to a local radio
station and said, 'We
have this idea, we
want to broadcast

games on the Internet,' " he said.
After buying a 75-MH/ PC,
Cuban connected a radio tuned
to the basketball games and
began transmitting games
through his server. The venture
proved successful, and Cuban ex
panded to transmitting broad
casts of many more college and
professional sports teams.
As Cuban's audience grew, he
realized that streaming media
over the Internet was a viable
concept. But the myriad applica
tions he dreamed of didn't always
work as well as he hoped. Cuban
attempted to sell everything from
background music for shopping
sites like Amazon to giving audio
tours of various Web sites in for
eign languages, all ideas that
tanked miserably, he said.
Despite these failures, Cuban

was not discouraged. 1 "his was in
part because, having started his
business from "sweat equity" — in
other words, financing ii with his
own meager eat nings — he could
continue It \ ing new ideas without
pressure from outside financ iet s.
"But the bottom line of it was,

had I had someone I li.kl to re
port to, we couldn't let the busi
ness grow at its own
tempo . . . had we raised venture
capital, what would have hap
pened? They'd be [complaining]
about [performance] bench
marks and metrics." Cuban said.
Cuban finally had a break
through while talking to a friend,
the owner of a computer compa
ny called Inside Enterprises.
"I said it might be a cool idea it
vou guys broadcast your quarter
ly earnings conference calls. And
he's like, 'This is a cool idea be
cause we have all these sharehold
ers who never get this informa
tion, and we never get the chance
to talk to them,' " Cuban said.
The concept proved popular
within Inside Enterprises, and
an encouraged Cuban ap

proached other companies with
the same proposal.
"We walked into Motorola and
saicl. 'You ought to be broadcast
ing vour shareholder meetings
and voin quarterly and profits
conferences, vou ought to be
broadcasting internalh all yout

sales training.' Mo
torola's chief execu
tive officer alt each
used Broadcast .com
to listen to Chicago
White Sox baseball,
and he agreed to use
it for Motorola's
meetings. B\ aggres
sively pursuing simi
lar deals, Cuban
transformed Broad
cast.com into a bil
lion-dollar compa
ny, and then sold it
to Yahoo!.
As he told the
story of Broad
cast.com, Cuban
reiterated the im
portance of thor
ough knowledge
and preparation
for one's work and
the importance of
enjoying the work
as well.
"People used to
ask me what my
biggest fear was,"
Cuban said. "One,
that there was some
12-year-old knl
somewhere coming
up with some idea to
kick my butt. And,
two, that 1 wouldn't
be the smartest per
son in the room

.ihout my topic. Because it I
didn't know multimedia on the
Net better than everybody, then
how was I sure th.it I was doing
the right thing?"
However, Cuban stressed that
such detailed preparation is im
possible without really having
tun .it the same time.
"II vou're not getting in to a
business that you're going to have
fun at, and you're doing all that
work and preparation, that's ex
actly what you're going to think it
is: work and preparation . . . and
you're going to get bored with
tli.it real, real fast," Cuban said.
Cuban emphasized the impor
tance of fun by explaining his ex
perience with the Dallas Maver
icks, who had their first winning

Cuban's speech
focused on his basic
strategies and rules
for starting and run
ning a successful
business, and he illus
trated his concepts by
describing his per
sonal experiences
with Broadcast.com
and the Mavericks.
Cuban began by
explaining how he
founded Broad
cast.com in 1995, a
company that was
one of the first to
transmit streaming
multimedia over
the Internet. A
graduate of 1 ndiana
University and a
se 1 112 - p roc 1 a i m ed
rabid Indiana bas
ketball fan, Cuban
and other alumni
had no way to listen
to games when they
lived iti Dallas.
"So we started in a
little house 1 had, and
I went to a local radio
station and said, 'We
have this idea, we
want to broadcast

games on the Internet,' " he said.
After buying a 75-MH/ PC,
Cuban connected a radio tuned
to the basketball games and
began transmitting games
through his server. The venture
proved successful, and Cuban ex
panded to transmitting broad
casts of many more college and
professional sports teams.
As Cuban's audience grew, he
realized that streaming media
over the Internet was a viable
concept. But the myriad applica
tions he dreamed of didn't always
work as well as he hoped. Cuban
attempted to sell everything from
background music for shopping
sites like Amazon to giving audio
tours of various Web sites in for
eign languages, all ideas that
tanked miserably, he said.
Despite these failures, Cuban

was not discouraged. 1 "his was in
part because, having started his
business from "sweat equity" — in
other words, financing ii with his
own meager eat nings — he could
continue It \ ing new ideas without
pressure from outside financ iet s.
"But the bottom line of it was,

had I had someone I li.kl to re
port to, we couldn't let the busi
ness grow at its own
tempo . . . had we raised venture
capital, what would have hap
pened? They'd be [complaining]
about [performance] bench
marks and metrics." Cuban said.
Cuban finally had a break
through while talking to a friend,
the owner of a computer compa
ny called Inside Enterprises.
"I said it might be a cool idea it
vou guys broadcast your quarter
ly earnings conference calls. And
he's like, 'This is a cool idea be
cause we have all these sharehold
ers who never get this informa
tion, and we never get the chance
to talk to them,' " Cuban said.
The concept proved popular
within Inside Enterprises, and
an encouraged Cuban ap

proached other companies with
the same proposal.
"We walked into Motorola and
saicl. 'You ought to be broadcast
ing vour shareholder meetings
and voin quarterly and profits
conferences, vou ought to be
broadcasting internalh all yout

sales training.' Mo
torola's chief execu
tive officer alt each
used Broadcast .com
to listen to Chicago
White Sox baseball,
and he agreed to use
it for Motorola's
meetings. B\ aggres
sively pursuing simi
lar deals, Cuban
transformed Broad
cast.com into a bil
lion-dollar compa
ny, and then sold it
to Yahoo!.
As he told the
story of Broad
cast.com, Cuban
reiterated the im
portance of thor
ough knowledge
and preparation
for one's work and
the importance of
enjoying the work
as well.
"People used to
ask me what my
biggest fear was,"
Cuban said. "One,
that there was some
12-year-old knl
somewhere coming
up with some idea to
kick my butt. And,
two, that 1 wouldn't
be the smartest per
son in the room

.ihout my topic. Because it I
didn't know multimedia on the
Net better than everybody, then
how was I sure th.it I was doing
the right thing?"
However, Cuban stressed that
such detailed preparation is im
possible without really having
tun .it the same time.
"II vou're not getting in to a
business that you're going to have
fun at, and you're doing all that
work and preparation, that's ex
actly what you're going to think it
is: work and preparation . . . and
you're going to get bored with
tli.it real, real fast," Cuban said.
Cuban emphasized the impor
tance of fun by explaining his ex
perience with the Dallas Maver
icks, who had their first winning
