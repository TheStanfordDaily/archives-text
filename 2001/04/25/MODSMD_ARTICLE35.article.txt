fating disorders .ire not just the extremes of
anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. Dangerous tad
diets are also widespread in this country. In a society
wlu re thinness is embraced as an ideal, nearly every
Amcrit an woman, man and child has suffered at one
time 01 another from issues of weight, body shape
and self-image.
I he causes of eating disorders differ from per
son to person. I liesc factors range from media in
fluences to social, familial and peer pressure to a
lack of communication, among others.
While there is no way to identify exact causes of
eating disorders 01 self-diagnose the symptoms of
disordered eating, it is important to note the mental
factors that contribute to unhealthy relationships
with food.
Dr. Naomi Brown, a staff psychologist at ('.owell
Student Health Service, said that each case differs,
"lint what all eating disorders have in common is an
undue amount of time ruminating [and] obsessing
about weight, calories, thinness, good and bad foods,
excessive exercise to burn calories rather than to
enjoy the exercise or exercising for health and well
ness, a 'love-hate relationship with food where food
(or lack thereof) becomes an emotional container so
one does not have to feel or deal with feelings. These
obsessions may be expressed through starvation [or]
restriction, bingeing and/or purging," she said.
Heating .111 eating disorder is a mentally intense
process because it involves complex biological, psy
chological and nutritional factors. Many people suf
fering from eating disorders are unprepared for the
challenge because they may initially denv that thev
have a problem . To overcome their denial, they
need to empower themselves and c hallenge their

belief systems about thinness and both image.
Cowell reports that disordered eating ma\ haxe
many long-term effects on .1 person, both biologi
cally .ind psxchologically. Biologically, the long
term ettects max include damage to the heai 1 nuts
cle, gastrointestinal system, rcproducitye lite for
women, tooth decay, recession ot gums and bone
density loss, all depending on the specific t\pe ot
eating disorder.

Several students who have experienced eat

that all Stanford students are inherenth com

One student, who preferred to remain anonv

and that adds up. 1 believe thai college-aged students

this is where habits foi 'real life' outside of re >llege arc
formed. It will be harder to change and be more
healthy or balanced aftct college, so I think that stu
dents really need to be aware of how the\ are c lioos
ing to live."
This student also said that, while there are re
sources for help on this issue, tlieie is little attention
brought to disordered eating 111 let 111s of educ alion
and awareness. She said that this might be because
it is an extremely difficult issue to address.

While there is no way to identify exact causes of

Dr. Naomi Brown, a staff psychologist at ('.owell

"lint what all eating disorders have in common is an
undue amount of time ruminating [and] obsessing
about weight, calories, thinness, good and bad foods,

obsessions may be expressed through starvation [or]

process because it involves complex biological, psy
