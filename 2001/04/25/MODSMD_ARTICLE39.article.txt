High tech is 110 longei |iist about hard
ware and software, it's also about "tned
ware," said (iraham. who has witnessed the
tut nil* of medicine through her work at
( .iikl.iiu, ,t 111,mill.u liner of high-tei li treat
ments foi heart disease. She s.iid she be
lieves that the need for innovation and
streamlining 111 medicine li.is nevei been
greater.
We are fating .111 explosion ol health
needs due, ironicallv, to the fact that we
aie healthier and are living longer than
0111 ancestors, (iraham pointed out. "We
are suffering from good news," she s.iid.
Heart disease, cancer, diabetes ,md other
chronit illnesses are burgeoning, and
health care is having trouble keeping p.u e.
Despite the let hnologv explosion ol the
last de(ade, the infrastructure ol health
(.11 e remains antiquated.
Health care ranks UNtli out ol >3 majoi
industries in this countr\ in iuli ast lin -
ture, support and development lot infor
mation technology, right down there with
trucking and warehousing, (iraham told
the audieme. An estimated 70 percent ol
hospitals lost mone\ this year. " I here arc
so main tilings 111 business that could be
applied to health care, but we have .1 leal

ol tout lung health care. Its moral and so
cial; it's about inv privacy and my rights,"
(iraham said.
I he ( urrent paradigm of health care dis
courages new technology. For example,
(iraham tlest 1 ibed two alternative surgeries
tor coronary artery disease: bypass and an
gioplasty. Bypass is highly invasive and re
quires .111 extended hospital stay; angioplas
ty is minimally invasive, takes four hours
.uid sends voti home on the same dav. I 11-
foi innately, the bypass is more profitable for
the hospital. Angioplasty costs more on the
table, requiring stents, catheters and other
"te( h" tools, and 11 negates the revenue-gen
erating hospital stav.
(iraham highlighted the need to move
the people, investment and cash out ol hos
pitals. "All the nioncN is caught 111 bri( ksand
mortar in health care c urrently." she said.
" I bat's win innovation doesn't happen in
health ( are. I he nionev ( an'i go to the ideas;
11 s captive in the bricks and mortar." Ilei
proposal is to "move payment to where de
li ver\ [ol new ideas| and sm ( ess occurs."
\( conling to Graham, this move will take
bold leadership and money, (iraham (ailed
lot investois to put more nione\ into re
sean h. " I he nione\ must go where the In
line will be," she said. I lowcvci. convincing
investois to lund high-tech health research

a |>.111 ol \ike brand shoes, but we rant and

rave over paying $00 fora drug that could
save our lives, (iraham envisions a system
w here those who can afford to pav for health
out of pocket do so. "Everything can't be for
free," she said.
Also, few people are willing to invest in
products that may take L'O to 50 years to de
velop. "Innovation requires reward," she
said, adding that making regulations more
predictable would help swav hesitant in
vestors.
Bringing tc( hnolog\ to medicine is prob
ably inevitable; it also has extraordinary po
tential. (iraham described how "beating
heart" bypass surgery, pioneered In
(iuidant, allowed a young woman to receive
life-saving bypass sin gen and delivei twins
at the same time; the twins would have died
had doctors bad to stop their mother's
heart. (iraham also highlighted ad vane es in
gene ther.qn that would allow people to ic
generate heart tissue using their own bone
marrow cells.
But, (irah.un's talk also elucidated (In
differences between high-tech health care
and the rest of the tech industry. At some
level, many people inherenlb fear the
merging of tcchnolog\ and business with

p red it ted (iingei 1.. (iraham. group (hail -
woman ol (>111(1.1111 (.01 poi.iiion, at a Stan
ford breakfast briefing on high-tech lie.ilth
1 are on April IH.
High tech is 110 longei |iist about hard
ware and software, it's also about "tned
ware," said (iraham. who has witnessed the
tut nil* of medicine through her work at
( .iikl.iiu, ,t 111,mill.u liner of high-tei li treat
ments foi heart disease. She s.iid she be
lieves that the need for innovation and
streamlining 111 medicine li.is nevei been
greater.
We are fating .111 explosion ol health
needs due, ironicallv, to the fact that we
aie healthier and are living longer than
0111 ancestors, (iraham pointed out. "We
are suffering from good news," she s.iid.
Heart disease, cancer, diabetes ,md other
chronit illnesses are burgeoning, and
health care is having trouble keeping p.u e.
Despite the let hnologv explosion ol the
last de(ade, the infrastructure ol health
(.11 e remains antiquated.
Health care ranks UNtli out ol >3 majoi
industries in this countr\ in iuli ast lin -
ture, support and development lot infor
mation technology, right down there with
trucking and warehousing, (iraham told
the audieme. An estimated 70 percent ol
hospitals lost mone\ this year. " I here arc
so main tilings 111 business that could be
applied to health care, but we have .1 leal

ol tout lung health care. Its moral and so
cial; it's about inv privacy and my rights,"
(iraham said.
I he ( urrent paradigm of health care dis
courages new technology. For example,
(iraham tlest 1 ibed two alternative surgeries
tor coronary artery disease: bypass and an
gioplasty. Bypass is highly invasive and re
quires .111 extended hospital stay; angioplas
ty is minimally invasive, takes four hours
.uid sends voti home on the same dav. I 11-
foi innately, the bypass is more profitable for
the hospital. Angioplasty costs more on the
table, requiring stents, catheters and other
"te( h" tools, and 11 negates the revenue-gen
erating hospital stav.
(iraham highlighted the need to move
the people, investment and cash out ol hos
pitals. "All the nioncN is caught 111 bri( ksand
mortar in health care c urrently." she said.
" I bat's win innovation doesn't happen in
health ( are. I he nionev ( an'i go to the ideas;
11 s captive in the bricks and mortar." Ilei
proposal is to "move payment to where de
li ver\ [ol new ideas| and sm ( ess occurs."
\( conling to Graham, this move will take
bold leadership and money, (iraham (ailed
lot investois to put more nione\ into re
sean h. " I he nione\ must go where the In
line will be," she said. I lowcvci. convincing
investois to lund high-tech health research
isn't always eas\. (iraham noted.
(ii aliam said she believes that Ainei ic aus
don't want to p. 1 \ tor health (are. She ob
served thai we nia\ be willing to pa\ SIBO 101
a |>.111 ol \ike brand shoes, but we rant and

rave over paying $00 fora drug that could
save our lives, (iraham envisions a system
w here those who can afford to pav for health
out of pocket do so. "Everything can't be for
free," she said.
Also, few people are willing to invest in
products that may take L'O to 50 years to de
velop. "Innovation requires reward," she
said, adding that making regulations more
predictable would help swav hesitant in
vestors.
Bringing tc( hnolog\ to medicine is prob
ably inevitable; it also has extraordinary po
tential. (iraham described how "beating
heart" bypass surgery, pioneered In
(iuidant, allowed a young woman to receive
life-saving bypass sin gen and delivei twins
at the same time; the twins would have died
had doctors bad to stop their mother's
heart. (iraham also highlighted ad vane es in
gene ther.qn that would allow people to ic
generate heart tissue using their own bone
marrow cells.
But, (irah.un's talk also elucidated (In
differences between high-tech health care
and the rest of the tech industry. At some
level, many people inherenlb fear the
merging of tcchnolog\ and business with
the realm ol niedi( ine, (iraham said, fOl ex
ample. (iraham described bet vision of im
planted dcvi( es — siu Ii as pateniakei s, de
fibrillators and hip replacements — tians
mitting information about 0111 botlib flint -
lions automatically to doctors. Siu 11 would
be the beginning of a new wave of medu ine,
(iraham said.
