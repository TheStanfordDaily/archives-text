Eventually, the administration
issued a report on the bias-related
incidents, titled "Transform the
Climate of the Larger Campus
Community," which announced
th.it the university would be re
sponding to the situation with
safety, student life and academic
curricula.
Cornell junior Erica Hoffman
said the hate criminals on campus
have "been diligently pursued, and
safety measures have been taken."
"For example," Hoffman said,
"new lights were installed 011 a
bridge that many students cross at
night. This bridge was the scene of
a hate crime, and it had been very
pool Iv lit in the past."
Georgetown University
In Dec. 1999, Georgetown was
hit by .1 series of anti-Semitic ac
tions bv unidentified people who
knocked over and destroyed
mcnorahs.
I hese actions were enough to
prompt an investigation by the
FBI. whi< h led to the arrest of one
of the alleged perpetrators,
Michael Bvrne, a sophomore at
the school.
Like Stanford, students at
Georgetown held a rally in the
school's version of White Plaza,
Red Square, (ondemning the ac ts
of intolerance. A group of black,
Latino, gav and Jewish students
formed the Georgetown Unitv
Coalition, which organized the
1 .ills and other events to bring at

tention to hate crimes on campus.
Students at Georgetown ques
tioned the role of their president.
Father Leo O'Donovan, in the cri
sis when he did not attend the rally.
Harvard University
Harvard has also experienced a
large number of hate crimes. Last
year, a resident tutor, who was also
the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian,Trans
gender and Supporters adviser,
twice found homophobic graffiti
011 his door at Mather House, ac -
cording to the Harvard Crimson.
The spokesperson tot the Har
vard Police told the Crimson that
it was"a vandalism incident moti
vated by hate." However, she also
revealed that she knew of 110 pre
vious arrest ever for an on-campus
hate crime.
I bis fall, the Crimson reported
on a possible hate crime in 1 farvard
Square, when a Muslim student
was attacked 011 his wav home from
services.
A suspect was arrested, though
he claimed the situation was not
motivated by hate. The event was
preceded by an incident when skin
heads veiled homophobic slurs at
Harvard undergraduates weeks
earlier.
Due in part to a new Massachu
setts law and the rise in hate
crimes on campus, Harvard Po
lice has begun to hand out wallet
sized cards to its officers that are
made by the Anti-Defamation
League. Fhese cards are intended
to help officers recognize and
handle hate crimes.
I .aura Coltin, .1 junior at liar

vard, said she does not worry
about hate crimes.
"I feel that Harvard is a very
accepting and open campus,"
Coltin said.
" There will probably always be
problems in any city where lots ot
different kinds of people are
thrown together, but 1 don't feel
threatened here."
University of California
The University of California
lias had to deal with a number ot
violent bate crime incidents on
campus that involve Caucasians
and Asians in the Greek, system.
The situation began in ( Vtober
when members of a l'C-l)avis
white fraternity shouted racial slurs
at .i group of Asian sorority stu
dents from Cal State-Sacramento.
Later that month, two UC-
Davis fraternities, one primarily
Asian and one primarily Cau
casian, got into a physical alien a
tion at an apartment building ot)
campus.
The Caucasian group later re
turned to the apartment, assault
ing the Asian Americans and steal
ing over $400 worth of property.
The fights continued, and two
white students were later arrested
by police and charged with five
counts of burglary, assault and
perpetration of hate crimes, ac
cording to Asianweek.com.
In February, over 500 students
from l'C-l)avis and I ( .-Berkeley
protested at a teach-in, demand
ing a better future response by the
administration and noting the
lack of sufficient Asian-American

support on campus.
The Associated Students >112 the
University of California unviled a
hate crimes Web site last siring.
According to the Daily Cafbrn
ian, the site will "monitoi hate
crimes and provide indorsation
about their impact on the canpus
community."
The site contains both loci and
national statistics on hate rimes
and also has a reporting loin for
\ ictims of such crimes.
Students at Stanford liae no
such online resource, butVVais
said that he is not opposed o the
idea.
"We want any system wc have
to be user friendly," Wais sad. "It
a Web site can create that en'iron
nient, we should consider it.
T here is much to be lea ned
from other universities' appnac li
es to handling similar situaions,
though Wais notes that Stanord's
protocol for dealing with hate
crimes is considered a naional
standard.
In the future, Wais will bccon
vening a group of students tohelp
review this protocol and lo»k at
other schools, as well as the deas
of Stanford students, as a means
for improving it.
Wais said that, in his conversa
tions with a variety of colleagues
from across the country, he has
found they all take the prollem
seriously.
"Universities are not iniinme
to society's problems." Wais aid.
"It's like alcohol. 1 don't knew a
school that doesn't have a proßem
dealing with this."

issued a report on the bias-related
incidents, titled "Transform the

th.it the university would be re

Cornell junior Erica Hoffman
said the hate criminals on campus
have "been diligently pursued, and
safety measures have been taken."
"For example," Hoffman said,
"new lights were installed 011 a
bridge that many students cross at

Georgetown University
In Dec. 1999, Georgetown was
hit by .1 series of anti-Semitic ac
tions bv unidentified people who
knocked over and destroyed
mcnorahs.
I hese actions were enough to
prompt an investigation by the
FBI. whi< h led to the arrest of one
of the alleged perpetrators,
Michael Bvrne, a sophomore at
the school.
Like Stanford, students at
Georgetown held a rally in the
school's version of White Plaza,
Red Square, (ondemning the ac ts
of intolerance. A group of black,
Latino, gav and Jewish students
formed the Georgetown Unitv
Coalition, which organized the
1 .ills and other events to bring at

tention to hate crimes on campus.
Students at Georgetown ques
tioned the role of their president.
Father Leo O'Donovan, in the cri

Harvard University
Harvard has also experienced a
large number of hate crimes. Last
year, a resident tutor, who was also
the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian,Trans
gender and Supporters adviser,
twice found homophobic graffiti
011 his door at Mather House, ac -
cording to the Harvard Crimson.
The spokesperson tot the Har
vard Police told the Crimson that
it was"a vandalism incident moti
vated by hate." However, she also
revealed that she knew of 110 pre
vious arrest ever for an on-campus
hate crime.
I bis fall, the Crimson reported
on a possible hate crime in 1 farvard
Square, when a Muslim student
was attacked 011 his wav home from
services.
A suspect was arrested, though
he claimed the situation was not
motivated by hate. The event was
preceded by an incident when skin
heads veiled homophobic slurs at
Harvard undergraduates weeks
earlier.
Due in part to a new Massachu
setts law and the rise in hate
crimes on campus, Harvard Po
lice has begun to hand out wallet
sized cards to its officers that are
made by the Anti-Defamation
League. Fhese cards are intended
to help officers recognize and
handle hate crimes.
I .aura Coltin, .1 junior at liar

vard, said she does not worry
about hate crimes.
"I feel that Harvard is a very
accepting and open campus,"
Coltin said.
" There will probably always be
problems in any city where lots ot
different kinds of people are
thrown together, but 1 don't feel
threatened here."
University of California
The University of California
lias had to deal with a number ot
violent bate crime incidents on
campus that involve Caucasians
and Asians in the Greek, system.
The situation began in ( Vtober
when members of a l'C-l)avis
white fraternity shouted racial slurs
at .i group of Asian sorority stu
dents from Cal State-Sacramento.
Later that month, two UC-
Davis fraternities, one primarily
Asian and one primarily Cau
casian, got into a physical alien a
tion at an apartment building ot)
campus.
The Caucasian group later re
turned to the apartment, assault
ing the Asian Americans and steal
ing over $400 worth of property.
The fights continued, and two
white students were later arrested
by police and charged with five
counts of burglary, assault and
perpetration of hate crimes, ac
cording to Asianweek.com.
In February, over 500 students
from l'C-l)avis and I ( .-Berkeley
protested at a teach-in, demand
ing a better future response by the
administration and noting the
lack of sufficient Asian-American

support on campus.

University of California
The University of California
lias had to deal with a number ot
violent bate crime incidents on
campus that involve Caucasians
and Asians in the Greek, system.
The situation began in ( Vtober
when members of a l'C-l)avis
white fraternity shouted racial slurs
at .i group of Asian sorority stu
dents from Cal State-Sacramento.
Later that month, two UC-
Davis fraternities, one primarily
Asian and one primarily Cau
casian, got into a physical alien a
tion at an apartment building ot)
campus.
The Caucasian group later re
turned to the apartment, assault
ing the Asian Americans and steal
ing over $400 worth of property.
The fights continued, and two
white students were later arrested
by police and charged with five
counts of burglary, assault and
perpetration of hate crimes, ac
cording to Asianweek.com.
In February, over 500 students
from l'C-l)avis and I ( .-Berkeley
protested at a teach-in, demand
ing a better future response by the
administration and noting the
lack of sufficient Asian-American

support on campus.
The Associated Students >112 the
University of California unviled a
hate crimes Web site last siring.
According to the Daily Cafbrn
ian, the site will "monitoi hate
crimes and provide indorsation
about their impact on the canpus
community."
The site contains both loci and
national statistics on hate rimes
and also has a reporting loin for
\ ictims of such crimes.
Students at Stanford liae no
such online resource, butVVais
said that he is not opposed o the
idea.
"We want any system wc have
to be user friendly," Wais sad. "It
a Web site can create that en'iron
nient, we should consider it.
T here is much to be lea ned
from other universities' appnac li
es to handling similar situaions,
though Wais notes that Stanord's
protocol for dealing with hate
crimes is considered a naional
standard.
In the future, Wais will bccon
vening a group of students tohelp
review this protocol and lo»k at
other schools, as well as the deas
of Stanford students, as a means
for improving it.
Wais said that, in his conversa
tions with a variety of colleagues
from across the country, he has
found they all take the prollem
seriously.
"Universities are not iniinme
to society's problems." Wais aid.
"It's like alcohol. 1 don't knew a
school that doesn't have a proßem
dealing with this."
Editor's Note: This is the first in a three-part
scries about luite crimes on campus. hrok foi
next week's article on Stanford''* policies
against hate entries and liow students address
these problems.
Many students have expressed out
rage at the recent series of rai ist graffiti

in Building .">(), home <>t the ('.enter tor
I.(si Asian Studies, and in l.anr History
Coiner. Originalh discovered during
u inter quarter finals week in Marc h, the
graffiti included white supremacist. anti-
Asian .uid sexist messages written in
Mack mat ker on the walls of classrooms.
I his is not the first hate crime that has
happened .11 Stanford in recent history,
nor is Stanford alone in having to handle
sue h problems.

Since his arrival in Sept. 1995, Dean
<>l Students Mart Wais says that there
lias been "an uneven but stead) occur
rence of acts of intolerance and threats
to the community."
For example, students found homo
phobic graffiti in the Bollards Hating
(]lub <u Suites in 1997, and.the year be
fore that, racist graffiti appeared in the
Asian Ainci it .111 \( tivities (rntei.

('.orncll D.iih Sun.
Siniilai to the response .11 Si.in

not enough immediate response

t\ s administration.
In ,111 editorial tilled, "A De

stall said. "Manv students were left
with .1 perception tli.il the univer
sii\ w.is not pulling its consider
able resources behind informum

the community of such incidents
and pursuing actions that might
reduce their future occurrence."
Eventually, the administration
issued a report on the bias-related
incidents, titled "Transform the
Climate of the Larger Campus
Community," which announced
th.it the university would be re
sponding to the situation with
safety, student life and academic
curricula.
Cornell junior Erica Hoffman
said the hate criminals on campus
have "been diligently pursued, and
safety measures have been taken."
"For example," Hoffman said,
"new lights were installed 011 a
bridge that many students cross at
night. This bridge was the scene of
a hate crime, and it had been very
pool Iv lit in the past."
Georgetown University
In Dec. 1999, Georgetown was
hit by .1 series of anti-Semitic ac
tions bv unidentified people who
knocked over and destroyed
mcnorahs.
I hese actions were enough to
prompt an investigation by the
FBI. whi< h led to the arrest of one
of the alleged perpetrators,
Michael Bvrne, a sophomore at
the school.
Like Stanford, students at
Georgetown held a rally in the
school's version of White Plaza,
Red Square, (ondemning the ac ts
of intolerance. A group of black,
Latino, gav and Jewish students
formed the Georgetown Unitv
Coalition, which organized the
1 .ills and other events to bring at

tention to hate crimes on campus.
Students at Georgetown ques
tioned the role of their president.
Father Leo O'Donovan, in the cri
sis when he did not attend the rally.
Harvard University
Harvard has also experienced a
large number of hate crimes. Last
year, a resident tutor, who was also
the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian,Trans
gender and Supporters adviser,
twice found homophobic graffiti
011 his door at Mather House, ac -
cording to the Harvard Crimson.
The spokesperson tot the Har
vard Police told the Crimson that
it was"a vandalism incident moti
vated by hate." However, she also
revealed that she knew of 110 pre
vious arrest ever for an on-campus
hate crime.
I bis fall, the Crimson reported
on a possible hate crime in 1 farvard
Square, when a Muslim student
was attacked 011 his wav home from
services.
A suspect was arrested, though
he claimed the situation was not
motivated by hate. The event was
preceded by an incident when skin
heads veiled homophobic slurs at
Harvard undergraduates weeks
earlier.
Due in part to a new Massachu
setts law and the rise in hate
crimes on campus, Harvard Po
lice has begun to hand out wallet
sized cards to its officers that are
made by the Anti-Defamation
League. Fhese cards are intended
to help officers recognize and
handle hate crimes.
I .aura Coltin, .1 junior at liar

vard, said she does not worry
about hate crimes.
"I feel that Harvard is a very
accepting and open campus,"
Coltin said.
" There will probably always be
