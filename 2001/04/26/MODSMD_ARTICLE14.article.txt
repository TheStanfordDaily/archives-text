On April 26, 1988, I he Dail\ printed an article
about "Pro Fro Week."
"Last week's experiment.il program tor prospec
tive freshmen was successful despite cold and rainv
weather, program organizers said.
"Alxmt 500 prosper tive freshmen, or 'pro tros' —
high si'lic h >1 seniors who have been .u cepted to Stanford
but are still deciding whether the\ will attend the I ni
\ersitv — werehostedln students during ho Fro Week.
"The one-week structure of the program was a
c hange from last vear, w hen pro fios could \ isit and
be hosted anytime in April.
" l lie would-be students were able to attend vari
ous I ni\ei sii\-sponsored events, including campus
touts and an informational ASS I presentation."
Bottom line: If it was a success with cold weather and only
500 visitors in 1988, this year's rainy Admit Weekend
wasn't too shabby after all.
