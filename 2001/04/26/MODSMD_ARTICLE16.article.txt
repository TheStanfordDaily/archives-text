directed the adaptation ol "Faust."
Hash is .i so us of two mono

which were written In plavwiight

"Hash. Iskandai s.ud, "is ,i

different levels because it is also a
unique of the Mormon Church
and our casual attitudes toward vi
olence in (ontemporarv sot ietv."
I lie slowl\ developing tension
of "Hash was a stark contrast to
the constant use of color and
sound in "Faust."
Weinberg represented each
character in "Faust" with four ac
tresses dressed in the same color.
She also added a variet\ of percus

rhvthm corresponding to the ac
tions .uid words ol the ( haracters.

She (ombined parts from each
translation and treated a

Freshman Daniel Jackson had
a leading role in "Bash" and said
he hopes to work with MAI) again.
It w.is .i pleasant experience,"
Jackson said. "In order to get a
good show together, our i ehearsal
schedule had to be flexible lie
cause we have so much else going
on. ['Faust' and 'Bash'] went really
well for the amount of time we
spent on them. I hev were very
well exe( uted."
laekson. a prospective drama
major, contrasted this experi
ence with his acting for the
Drama Department.
" Fhe Drama Department has a
lot more monev, but putting on a
slum | with the Drama Depart
ment] is more acatlcmic, and von
have to deal with .i lot more theo
ry, |ackson said.
|unioi I hantel Benson, a
drama majoi and member of the
Rain s Head theater group,
agreed tli.it the department has a
more traditional style.

" Fhe Drama Department is
highly academic and methodi
cal. Benson said. "((Graduate]
students [in the Drama Depart
ment] have a specific image the\
want to project."
I hough the Drama Depart
ment offers manv opportunities
for student performance, junior
Fiona McNiff, a former writer and
director for Rani's Head, saitl she
thinks student-led theater groups
play an important role in the t ain
pus theater scene.
Highlights, Stage One. Rani's
Head, Savoiards — these groups
fill in the holes that the Drama
Department doesn't," McNiff
said. ! hev give more opportuni
ties to students who are not in the
department."
Iskandar said he is not trying to
compete with the department, but
rather to provide Stanford with a
different kind of theater.
"| Last quarter,] 1 [performed
in] a Drama Department produc
tion of a Pinter one art for the
Graduate Directing Workshop,"
Iskandar said. "I had a wondei fill
time working with extremely tal
ented actors and a gifted directoi.
(MAD I HSR] is absolutely not a
challenge to the hegemony of the
department."
The co-directors said thev hope
the group will become a fixture on
campus. Although Weinberg said
she hopes that the group of actors
will change and grow, she plans
foi MAD to have a core group ol
people that meet three times a
week.
We hope to be a fully function
ing permanent acting company
with a production team working
full time," Iskandar saitl.
