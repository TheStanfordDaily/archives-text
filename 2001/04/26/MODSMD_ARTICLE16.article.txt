In hopes <>l providing the
Stanford community with an
original and exciting alternative
to the current oil-campus theater
scene, ti eslnnen Kd Iskandai and
Data Weinberg created M \1)
1 'HSR, a student-run theater
group, in |anuary.
"1 want to experiment, take a
(li.uue and tackle ditlicnit materi
al for the sake (»t di atnatic experi
mentation itself and not for fulfill
ing the requirements of a drama
inajoilskandai said.
Iskandai said he did not origi
nall\ plan to form his own theater
group.
I was extrenielx surprised hv
tliec ainpus theater scene," Iskan
dai said. "1 was highly disap
pointed that, at an institution this
prestigious and large, there were
lealh onh two student theatei
gl (Mips.
I nlike Iskandai, Weinberg
said s!ie expected to start her own
theatei group when she arrived
on campus.
I pel sotialh like to wi lie m\
own pla\s." Weinberg said. "1 ex
pected to form niv own company
when I came here. Ii w .is jusi kind
of 11k k that 1 met Kd."
M \l) I lISR s f'n si production,
'Hash and lailst, was adver
tised as ,i "double bill of hell and
was pet formed for three audi
ences on Man h 2 and Marc h at
the Roble I'arloi I heater. Iskan
dai direi ted Hash" and Weinberg
directed the adaptation ol "Faust."
Hash is .i so us of two mono
logues followed by .i dialogue, .ill of
which were written In plavwiight
and filmmaker Neil I„ibuie.
"Hash. Iskandai s.ud, "is ,i
postmodei nist take on mvthologi

cal narratives. It plavs on many
different levels because it is also a
unique of the Mormon Church
and our casual attitudes toward vi
olence in (ontemporarv sot ietv."
I lie slowl\ developing tension
of "Hash was a stark contrast to
the constant use of color and
sound in "Faust."
Weinberg represented each
character in "Faust" with four ac
tresses dressed in the same color.
She also added a variet\ of percus
sion instruments to create a
rhvthm corresponding to the ac
tions .uid words ol the ( haracters.
\\ einberg const nu ted her ver
sion ol "Faust" from three diff'er
ent existing translations in a
process (ailed cross-translation.
She (ombined parts from each
translation and treated a
rhyming pattern.
Freshman Daniel Jackson had
a leading role in "Bash" and said
he hopes to work with MAI) again.
It w.is .i pleasant experience,"
Jackson said. "In order to get a
good show together, our i ehearsal
schedule had to be flexible lie
cause we have so much else going
on. ['Faust' and 'Bash'] went really
well for the amount of time we
spent on them. I hev were very
well exe( uted."
laekson. a prospective drama
major, contrasted this experi
ence with his acting for the
Drama Department.
" Fhe Drama Department has a
lot more monev, but putting on a
slum | with the Drama Depart
ment] is more acatlcmic, and von
have to deal with .i lot more theo
ry, |ackson said.
|unioi I hantel Benson, a
drama majoi and member of the
Rain s Head theater group,
agreed tli.it the department has a
more traditional style.

" Fhe Drama Department is
highly academic and methodi
cal. Benson said. "((Graduate]
students [in the Drama Depart
ment] have a specific image the\
want to project."
I hough the Drama Depart
ment offers manv opportunities
for student performance, junior
Fiona McNiff, a former writer and
director for Rani's Head, saitl she
thinks student-led theater groups
play an important role in the t ain
pus theater scene.
Highlights, Stage One. Rani's
Head, Savoiards — these groups
fill in the holes that the Drama
Department doesn't," McNiff
said. ! hev give more opportuni
ties to students who are not in the
department."
Iskandar said he is not trying to
compete with the department, but
rather to provide Stanford with a
different kind of theater.
"| Last quarter,] 1 [performed
in] a Drama Department produc
tion of a Pinter one art for the
Graduate Directing Workshop,"
Iskandar said. "I had a wondei fill
time working with extremely tal
ented actors and a gifted directoi.
(MAD I HSR] is absolutely not a
challenge to the hegemony of the
department."
The co-directors said thev hope
the group will become a fixture on
campus. Although Weinberg said
she hopes that the group of actors
will change and grow, she plans
foi MAD to have a core group ol
people that meet three times a
week.
We hope to be a fully function
ing permanent acting company
with a production team working
full time," Iskandar saitl.
Although Benson said she
