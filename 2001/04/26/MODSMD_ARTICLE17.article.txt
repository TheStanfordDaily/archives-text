1 hough (ion/ale/ s main duties are to pro
mote diversity among I niversit\ stall, she has
said that she will work closely with the ()llice ol
Residential Kducation and administrators to
eiK mirage multicultural education in the com
ing year, (ion/ale/ s ap|)oiiitment indicates a
greater commitment to diversity issues, but stu
dents are also an important part of the diversit\
('({nation on campus. Res I d must use (ion/ale/
as a i esource for its own diversitx progi .miming
and. ideally, expand its programming about di
versit\ on campus.
With the recent discussions of hate( i imeson
campus, (ion/ale/ and Res Kd should extend
dialogues and cultural events to students as
well. In addition, with Mm ra\ House taking on

.1 locus in Comparative Sincfit's in Racc and
Kilniic it\ next \car, it is imperative thai (•on/a
le/ .md her st.ill Ik' involved on some level in
(lie programming that goes on there, as well as
in bringing th.it programming to the entire
campus.
( in rcntlv. the general leeling on campus is
that the I niversitx is not open to discussions
about race, lint creating this new directorship
gives st.ill .nul students the opportunity to in
teract with the administration to change the
w.i\ race is addi essed on campus. ()ne ol («on
/ale/'s goals is to strengthen the relationship
between stall and administrators, which is cer
tainh a necessan project. We st rough encour

with stall and establish new relationships with
students next vear. ()nl\ then ( an the I 'niversi
