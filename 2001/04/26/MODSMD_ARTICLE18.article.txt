lake love. You feel ( lose to \oui pat t

else from the same sort of intimac\ the
two of von share. If he or she were to be
inclusive in lus or her affections, vou'd
feel jealous, as it the love weren't as sub
stantial. "Sharing the love just makes it
worth less.
lo think that we can build stronger
bonds h\ iik hiding people is completely
wrong. Including everyone |ust means
that out relationships with each other
can't ever be rcalh deep or meaningful.
In its haste to iik lude, Stanford has cre
ated a dispassionate, atomistic student
population. Nohoch feels like he or she
belongs anywhere, to am group, except
within at it c le of personal friends. Secret
societies, on the othet hand, have it ex

it's excluding people that we rcalh
should be d«>ing.
