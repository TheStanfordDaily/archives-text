Wilbur renovation may not be best
answer to student dining concerns
I li.ul mixed feelings when reading
the plans lor ihe W'ilbut kiw hen renova
lion. While the plan alludes to .in aetion
long overdue— that ol updating the
dining h.tils— I leelth.it it inadequatek
addresses the issue b\ attempting to
"make over" appearances. I here has
been much praise lot the Stern Dining
Hall renovation, but the deeper issue is
not (osmetics.
One eannot make over low qualitx
tood. whit h is the pritnan concern ol stu
dents. as < ited In the two interviews in
I he Dailv article. Further eomplaints in
clude am combination ol the following
factors: the ridiculoush high (ost ol the
meal plans; the inlle\ibilit\ of opting
against the dining plan, barring tood poi
soning; the poor varietv ol vegetarian and
vegan options, barring the salad bar; the
restrii live serving hours that (ontlict \\ ith
st lied tiling and location ol (lasses; and the
wasted lood.
While 1 was ext ited to hear ol the new
128-meal plan that allows vou to host
non-dortn guests without exhausting all
three guest meals in the first two weeks. I
still think much more can Ik- done, and
this is not without solution. Consider the
co-ops. sell-ops and eating t luhs. In terms
of cost and waste cllicietu \. the co-ops are
the model example: With board bills
around $. r ioo, one gets dinner that ranges
trom stir-lrv to lull-blown three-course
dinners that 90 percent ol the time are sig
nifieantlv better than ones found in the

dining halls, plus an open kitchen (121
hours) of junk food and otliei necessities,
flic vegetarian options are cjiiite good,
and the co-ops arc flexible about letting
the residents eat elsew liei e bee ause of di
et.in or personal needs. (There are co
ops to serve people with a varict\ of di
etan needs and preferences). While the
self-ops and eating c lubs are incire expen
sive, the\ are comparable to dining hall
costs and include both a (gourmet) chef
and an open kit( hen.
(.iven these working and popular
models, the I niversitx should consider
more drastic ( hanges than a renovation.
It it is willing toe onsider theoveiarching

Wilbur renovation may not be best
answer to student dining concerns
I li.ul mixed feelings when reading
the plans lor ihe W'ilbut kiw hen renova
lion. While the plan alludes to .in aetion
long overdue— that ol updating the
dining h.tils— I leelth.it it inadequatek
addresses the issue b\ attempting to
"make over" appearances. I here has
been much praise lot the Stern Dining
Hall renovation, but the deeper issue is
not (osmetics.
One eannot make over low qualitx
tood. whit h is the pritnan concern ol stu
dents. as < ited In the two interviews in
I he Dailv article. Further eomplaints in
clude am combination ol the following
factors: the ridiculoush high (ost ol the
meal plans; the inlle\ibilit\ of opting
against the dining plan, barring tood poi
soning; the poor varietv ol vegetarian and
vegan options, barring the salad bar; the
restrii live serving hours that (ontlict \\ ith
st lied tiling and location ol (lasses; and the
wasted lood.
While 1 was ext ited to hear ol the new
128-meal plan that allows vou to host
non-dortn guests without exhausting all
three guest meals in the first two weeks. I
still think much more can Ik- done, and
this is not without solution. Consider the
co-ops. sell-ops and eating t luhs. In terms
of cost and waste cllicietu \. the co-ops are
the model example: With board bills
around $. r ioo, one gets dinner that ranges
trom stir-lrv to lull-blown three-course
dinners that 90 percent ol the time are sig
nifieantlv better than ones found in the

dining halls, plus an open kitchen (121
hours) of junk food and otliei necessities,
flic vegetarian options are cjiiite good,
and the co-ops arc flexible about letting
the residents eat elsew liei e bee ause of di
et.in or personal needs. (There are co
ops to serve people with a varict\ of di
etan needs and preferences). While the
self-ops and eating c lubs are incire expen
sive, the\ are comparable to dining hall
costs and include both a (gourmet) chef
and an open kit( hen.
(.iven these working and popular
models, the I niversitx should consider
more drastic ( hanges than a renovation.
It it is willing toe onsider theoveiarching
sti lie tin al c hanges involved with the cle
pariinent merger, there is no reason
win it cannot use the same open-mind
ed thinking when looking at the dining
system.
