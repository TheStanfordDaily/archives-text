## Varsity athlete 'pressured' into wearing Nike uniform 
### PETER STAIR GUEST COLUMNIST 
Our administrators arc doing .1 poor
job acquiring athletic uniiorms tor 0111
athletes. Whai s more, .111 at lili-it* friend
agrees with nit'. Most import.intlv. lit' isn't
comfortable agreeing with me public l\.
We talked reientlx and agreed that our
administratoi s are misleading us when
the\ claim that the \tliletit s Department
(.1111 lot .itford to bin uniforms and are dis
honest when the\ threaten cuts from the
ai atleiliii budget.

sit\ s "out- and onlx interest in negotiating
with \ike is to support our student-ath
letes. Without equipment conttacts like
this, the Department of Vthletiis xvoultl
not be able to provide mam of our stu
dent-athletes with uniforms and equip
ment."
As was ret cutl\ pt>intetl out in a lettei to
I 'he Dail\ b\ sophomore ( alvin Miaxx.

(" l*i t»\t»st Ktt hemendx's 1 espouse unsatis

ma limited sense: If the I niversitx had 1 u>
equipment contracts at all. then it is true
t hat it wouldn't be able to provide equip
ment to its teams. I lowever. Stanford I ui
\t i sit\ is not an impoverished institution,
nor is the Athletics Department under
funded. II the I nixersitx wanted to take
an idealism statue on the Nike sweatshop
issue, it could find a xvax to aflord the loss
of rexenue generated In the loss of the
swoosh.
I lie real issue, then, is .1 purelv eco
notnit one — even when the I nixersitx
appeals to be taking a commendable
stance on lorpin ate advertising, it does so
onh when it involves no toll on the I ni

I nixersitx removetl all eorporate bill

Hoxvever, the real falsehood in
Kit henieiulx s statement is that the I ni
versitv s luutlanient.il goal is to "support
|it s| student-athletes." A truer statement
might be "the I nixersitx s onlx interest is
to meet the needs of the At 111 ft its Dep.u t

ment as t lieaplx as possible and make sure
tliat, in doing so. we cover our own backs
so that xse don't look bad." I am a member
of a varsity Stanford athletic team. About
six weeks ago, as the opposition to remov
ing the Nike contract with the swoosh in
place began to rise in prominence, our
coat h called a team meeting.
W hat he had to sax was essentially this:
I he Athletics Department has asked me
to ask you gux s if anx of you have a prob
lem with having the \ike swoosh on vour
uniforms." I should point out that ath
letes. as a group, tend toward conser
vatism— the coach's question xxas met
xx itli laughter and shrugs.
"W hat s the issuer asked one confused
teammate. I didn't sax anything. 1 don't
