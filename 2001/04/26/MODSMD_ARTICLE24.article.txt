the weapons would allow I aiwan, whit li
China claims as part of its territorv, to
defend itself.
I lie Chinese threat to respond l)\
c urtailing cooperation on arms control

Li, China's vice foreign minister,
summoned I .S. Ambassadoi Joseph
Prueher to hear Beijing's protest over
tlie arms package, li demanded that
Washington immediately cancel the sale
and stop selling weapons to Taiwan "to
avoid new serious damage to China-1 .S.
relations.
" I lie Chinese people and the people
<>l the world reali/e once again that the
U.S. government does not live up to its
promises, and facts have revealed ih.it
the U.S. does not actually want sustained
peace and stability across the Taiwan
Straits," China's official Xinhua News
Agency quoted Li as saving.
"Where on earth is the U.S. trying to
lead Sino-l .S. relations.-''
Bwsli approved the sale of four kidd
(lass destroyers, up to eight diesel sub
marines, 12 l'-3 anti-submarine aircraft
anclothei weapons. Hut Washington de
ferred the possible sale of destroyers
equipped with the state-of-the-art Aegis
radar s\stem. China had warned that a
deal involving Aegis would have grave
implications.
Washington is committed to selling
I aiwan defensive weapons under the
1079 1 aiwan Relations Act, passed after
Washington cut ties with l aipei in favor
of diplomatic relations with Beijing.
But in lodging China's protest, Li de
scribed the submarines as offensive
weapons that "scotched the I .S. lies of
selling onl\ defensive weaponn to 1 ai
wan.'* Xinhua reported.
