davs since I'ippen's exraorclinary
claim, a number of otlie similar al
legations have surfacec ac ross the

conntrv, and thev deserve to be
brought to light.

of pretending to he .1 collection of
aging, overpaid talents past their
prime so that thev could stage .1
dramatic comeback against the

• In the NHL. the lx)S Angeles
Kings alleged that the Detroit Red
Wings faked their epie first-round
series eollapse against the Kings in
order to nib in the fact that most
I.os Angeles residents can't spell
"hexkev."
"They're trying to he like the
19N0 U.S. Olympic team," Kings
coach Andy Murray said. "They
know thev can't lose to anybody ex
cept the Avalanche, and they just
want to inject some excitement Ix--

fore (Colorado beats them senseless
in the second round."
I pon being informed bv re
porters that Los Angeles had, in
fact, won the series, Murray
replied. " That's what they'd like
vou to think, isn't it r" Murray then
fled the stage, whimpering.

sioner Bud Selig said todav in a
press conference that the New
York Yankees had intentionally
lost most of the games during the
dismal 2-14 streak with which they
ended last year's season.
"dome on, you think anyone
would have Ix-t on anyone but the
Yankees if" they'd won KM) games
last year?" Selig asked. "You think
any team can reallv go 2-1 I and still
win the world championship? They
just wanted other people to think

their respective hometown teams
had a chance last year before thev
crushed those hopes and dreams."
Upon tx'ing informed of the al
legations, Yankees owner (ieorge
Steinbrenner said. "Oh, lie's ab
solutely ri^lit. It's so much sweeter
to watch the tears of the opposing
team's children when thev thought
their daddies had a pravcr of win
ning. I hat was pan of our deal with
Satan, in tact."
• At tress ( "..ilista Flockhart told
reporters she believes Allv Mcßeal

have the spotlight on him."
"No, 1 just really like getting
high," Downey Jr. replied. "Noth
ing like tli.it sweet axaine!"
