### MATTHEW LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
l itis is turning into a habit for
the Minnesota Vikings. Head
coach Dennis Green drafts Stan
foul's top players more often than
Ari/ona Wildcats leave earlv tor
the NB\.
Well, maybe not that often, but
three ot the last four years Stan
ford's best plaver has drifted
through the draft only to be
snagged by Green's astute trout
ottice. Willie 1 toward became this
year's addition to Minnesota's
growing Cardinal taction on Sat
in da\ when Green selected the
defensive tackle .is the 20th pick
ot the second round and the f>7tli
pick overall. Howard joins wide
receivet l ro\ Walters, drafted in
2000, and defensive end Kailee
Wong, drafted in 109N. on the
Vikings' Stanford alumni squad.
"1 was honestly hoping that I
went a little earlier," I toward said.
"Hut, at the same time, .is the
names were going off the board
before the first round was over, I
|ust felt that Minnesota would be a
good place tor me because, com
ing from high school, 1 started at
Stanford and was able to make a
good transition from high school
to college because ot people like
Kailee and Troy."
But while Howard's transition
lo professional football will take
place with one of next \ ear's N F(

favorites, linebacker Riall John
son. the only other Cardinal cho
sen in the NFL draft, will suit up
lor Cincinnati. 1 he Bengals are a
young team in the midst of re
building that finished 4-12 last
season.
Bengals' first-year head coach
Dick Leheau stole Johnson with
the fifth pic k of the sixth round,
the 108 th overall selection. John
son, an underrated pass rusher
who led the Pacific 10 Conference
in sac ks his senior year, should tit
well into ('.incinnati's pass rushing
scheme.
"We like him because he re
minds us of types ot players who
we have had success with,"
Lebeau said. "He has played
clown, he has played up, he has
rushed, and he has dropped back.
A very, very productive sack man
for Stanford in a ver\ competitive
conference."
Both Johnson and Howard's
draft positions suffered because of
the wealth ot defensive talent
available in this year's draft.
Howard joined Minnesota's
much maligned defense as their
second pick of the day. In the first
round, the Vikings picked up
speech Wisconsin running back
Michael Bennett with the 27th
pick.
Howard said he is excited
about the opportunity to play

tored him throughout the entire

"[Wong and l| were vcr\

games with linn being defensive

(ircen's Stanfoid ties seem to
have cementcd a high regard for

With Howard, the \'ikings gain
a hard-nosed plavcr who is com
fortable in a leadership role and
prides himself on mental and
phvsical toughness. Howard did
not miss a start in font vears on the
I anil, including the 1900 Rose
bowl, when he plaved tlirough a
knee injurv. He was.i third-team
Mi-American in 2000 and a two

leader of Stanford's" I rem h Dog
defensive line. He should be able
to t oilll ibute immediateU to what
was one of the M(1 s worst de
fenses in 2000.
" I he biggest thing that I need
to do w hen 1 gel into the fat ilitv is

leader like I was ai Stanford,"
I Iowai(I said. "()nce vou be< oniea
leadci. vou cmi ii the respect and
von help till in the roles ili.it are
needed .is .i defensive lineman."
|ohnson approaches his op
portntiitN with ('.incinnati in a
similar fashion.
"I watched the system with
coach |\1 .ii k | Dufliicr," |ohnson
said." I lie s\ stem is a lot like u hat
we ran at Stanford. I think I can
do a lot ol things with eflort and
hard work."
|ohnson's speetl w;is his biggest
question mark with NFI scouts, as
thc\ worn that he tna\ not heahle
to drop ha< k into coverage at the
outside liiiebackei position. Hut
|ohnson sa\s his on-field pcrtor
mance should erase an\ discrep
ancies found on the stopwauh.
"When von get e\.iluated in the
M 1., the\ alwavs find a wa\ to
knock von down so ihe\ can draft
von lower and pa\ vou less." (ohn
son said. "Vou cannot measure
heart, tliev sa\. I was not last
enough . . . (Hut] vou do not run a
10-vard dash on the field, vou pla\

practice and dedication have added

Hut an Nil. contract alone will not
satish either man. I hc*\ strive to be
as sin cessful at the next level as thev
were in their college (areers.
"11 I can he halt as productive

will make an impact," Johnson
said, "but I plan on being as pro
ductive. 1 plan on stepping niv
game up and doing |ust what t did
at Stanford."
