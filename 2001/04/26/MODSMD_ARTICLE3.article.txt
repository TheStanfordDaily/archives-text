C.ase Against Abortion," and was
sponsored bv Stan ton I Students
toil ite, a pro-life campus group
dedicated to assisting women who
face i risis pregnancies.
Fhe event was part of Feminists
tor Fife's C.ollege Outreach Pro
grain. Fhe program "challenges
students t<> question abortion and
asks (ollege and university admin
istrators to provide resources for
pregnant and parenting stu
dents," Foster said.
"We need to start asking our
selves 'do we know women on this
(anipns who were pregnant?' " she
said. I went\-seven vears after the
Roe \ Wade dec ision, alx>rtion has
bet ome the status quo — one out of
every five abortions is performed
on a college woman, (.ollege stu
dents are constantly told to chal
lenge the status quo."
She said that college students
are at the highest risk for abor
tion. Instead of encouraging
abortion, feminist organizations
could better help mothers and
theii children In lobbying for
more public and private support

for single women with unexpec t
ed pregnancies.
"Women shouldn't be forced to
choose," Fostet said. "We should
refuse to i boose. Fvery woman in
Americ a and around the world de
serves better than abortion. We
just don't squander life."
Feminists for Fife is a pro
woman. pro-life organization. Its
stated goal is to facilitate practical
resources and support for
women in need, particularly col
lege students.
"| 1 lie organization! serves as a
catalyst foi developing resources
and progressive solutions for
pregnant and patenting students
l>\ asking women what they reallv
want — because women deserve
better," Foster said.
Foster c hallenged pro-life and
pro-choice students to work to
gether to provide the resources
that pregnant students need, thus
making abortions less necessary.
" l lie Feminists for Fife College
()utreac h program was developed
with people on both sides of the
debate," Foster said.
"It was great that she brought
up that pro-life people on campus
could put aside their differences to
work 011 something together," said
