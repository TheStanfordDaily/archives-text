I'm really interested in how vou not into

screenwriting. Were you a big
movie fan when you were
grow ing up?
Oh, \ call, I lox e tnox ics. I
wcnl to them kind ol relent
lesslx I grew 111 > in Massat lui
setts, .md it nexei occurred to
me that anvonc w i ote 'em at
.ill I just thought a dim toi
and a hi me h ol at t< >rs would
get together and. xiui know,
make a movie. And I xv,isn't
running around with a super-8
camera and dreaming about
being aw ritei and all that stuff.
I wish I had been because it
prohablx would have helped,
but. pist conceptuallx. I didn't
even think ol it.
When 1 was little, m\ dad
w.is ,i lislici in.in and nix uih les
were all fishermen .md nix
cousins. So w hen I got out ol
college. I went fishing lot a
\car back home. I had fished
one w inter, and 1 loved fishing,
hut it was |tist kind ol cold and
miserable, and the second xvin-

let was coining around and I knew I didn't
want to spend the winter doing it again, hut
I st.tried again in the spring and I had all
these weird ideas ahout just going some
place warm.
And I was in a bookstore and I saw this
hook and it said. "A (iuide to Film School"

and I just stopped and said, "What in
the world is film school?" I picked it
up and I was Hipping through it and it
was kind of like this weird moment
where I was like. "People learn how to
make movies?" You know, that kind
ol thing.

Yeah
And movies are made in Fos Angeles. 1
knew fora fact that that was going to be
wann. And so I ended up applying to a
bunc 11 ol places, and I got ateepted at one
place. And I went there and I bad to just
take- a sc reeiiw riling class as a requirement
and. um. it was just a weird thing. I he
c ourse was taught h\ an old FY writer. And
I w rote this script. and he said he thought ii
was good. So I was happ\ it was good, you
know So I s.iid. well, what do I do with it?
\nd he |nst said it was impossible. But there
was a contest, so I mailed the script away.
Su linnet came and I went home to Mass
ac husetis and suited lishing because I
net tled more money l«>i the next semestei
I c anie home one da\ and tin dacl was look
ing for me and he s.iid. "You won some
contest." \nd I almost couldn't remember.
You know. I thought I had maybe entered
inv name in a drawing loi a colot 1\ ot
something. And some agent called me out
<>l the blue and.the next thing I knew , I was
I>.it kin I A . just w i King away. kind ol not
know ing how to do it So t hat s in\ st i ange
stoi \ I don't even know il that's w hat you
asked me (laughs).
So you're basically a fisherman-come
screenwriter.
Yeah, basic.lib Hi it not even that I
mean, I was pist doing ii lor something to

do. 11 wasn't like I was deciding to lie a fish
erman lor the rest of tin life. I was just
doing it because I didn't know what else to
do.
How do you come up with ideas for sto
ries? Do you usually start with a charac

ter?
Yeah, usually. I hen usually I don't
know w hat to do w itli it. Somewhere in the
bat k of niv head, it's sort of working away,
but I consciously stop thinking about it.
And then si\ months will go by or whatev
er, and then, il it sta\s with me, something
(lu ks somehow and then I start writing.
()n this movie ["A Knight's 1 ale"], 1 had
read a book about tournament jousting
and how ii was a sport in medieval Kurope
and all this stuff, and I thought that il was a
great world to set a story in. No one's really
seen it before. But I didn't have a < harac ter,
and I didn't have a story, and so 1 never did
anything with it and years went by.
Fhen, for like 10 minutes one day, I
thought I would write a movie about a
st reenwriter who wauled to be a director,
and that just seemed awful. And then I
went back and looked at some ol inv old
notes .me 1 stti 11 and old ideas and I came
.it ross that idea — the medieval idea — and
one of the things I had written cloxui from
researching it was that you had to be of
noble birth to compete. I was looking at
that and I thought, well then, the charatter
should be a peasant. And then I thought
that's sot t of like the screemvliter who
w.ints to be a eliiee tot in some weird sort ol
wax I hat became the hook for the whole
thine.

So are screenwriters the peasants of
I lollvwood?
Yeah, yeah (laughs). I mean, they're
good peasants. II you have to be a peasant,
tl .it's a good one to be.
And you obviously agree that they are
highly underappreciated?

Oh, yeah. Ab
soluteh. fall.
What do you think is
going to happen with
the strike?
I think we're
going to go 011 sti ike lot
a long time. I mean, all oi
the issues, economic and
• reative, aside, it's just
that going on mi ike is in
as« 1 ecnxx i itet s blood
Do yon think the strike
will change things?
No, I don't think
so. It's a weird world. In
tele\ ision. w i iters at e the
kings ol telex isu>n. 1 \er\
famous, well-known, re
spected creative person
in telex ision is ,i w t iter. I
c onldn't tell xou one I \
director. And the best
ones .n c |iist trx ing to di
rett films And it kind ol
got divided np that way

for mMile unknown reason. You know, 5(1
\ cars ago, the directors controlled film and
the writers controlled television. And 1
don't know why it's that wa\. hut it is. and I
don't think it's going to change.
So who is it that overshadows the writers

and pushes them out of the so-called spot
light? Is it the studio heads?
It's the studios and the directors. For the
direc tors, it's kind of hard (for them] to take
credit fora movie w hen there's some writer
lurking around that wrote all the stull
down m the first place.

There was chat guy aC the Academy
Awards who got an honorary Oscar who
said that a film begins and ends with the
writer.
Yeah, and the director's job, really, is i<>
get .ill that up on the screen. Um ... I had
something intelligent to say . . . it's one of
the reasons win the\ like to rewrite every
one so hcavih because the\ can dilute it
and diminish exacth who is responsible.
And not even director is like this. Lots ol
direc tors, 1 mean realh good direc tors, are
all aware of the importance ol'a script and
.ill lh.it stulT.
It's like the old adage th.it writers direct
out ol sell-defense. I look at it in a more
pr.u in al wa\. that w hen the director reads
the script, what is important about that
stor\ to him might not be what impor
tant to aw riter and 01 he has a different
w.i\ ol telling the stor\ It's like il vou heat
a stor\ Irom someone and you repeat it.
vou're going to tell it dillerent than that
person did. So I don't realh l.inlt directors

dial much. It's just
their version <>l die
>tt »i \.
M\ attitude is just
kind of, il von want it
to be the stor\ that
\ou want it to he.
miii'i e hettei > >11 being
the one who yets to
tell it. Because, in .1
movie, the director is
the guv who gets to
tell the story, even
though it's not neces
sarily his ston I don't
realh think of iu\ sell
as a director. I think
ol myself as a writer
who kind of got rid of

the middle man.
Have you ever had the urge to jump in
front of the camera?
No, not at all (laughs). Actually. I was in
"Conspiracy Theory." It's not me, it's ni\
mug shot. I'm the guv who killed Julia

Roberts's father. And that's the be
ginning and end of my on-screen c a
reer.
Do you ever wake up in the morning
and think that all of this could go
away tomorrow because things are
so transient in Hollywood?
No. not really. I yvorry more that
whatever it is that 1 have inside of me
that makes me able to write will go

awa\ one morning, which manifests itself
especially if I have to go get \-ra\ s or some
thing like tli.it.
You think they're going to zap out your
writing ability?
(Laughs).
Do you ever get so-called writer's block?
1 think I have it all the time, basit .ills. e\-
ccpt foi little spurts. Whatcvei writer's block
is. it is to me what writing is. in .1 weird kind

ol \v.t\ — it's about
getting through
that. There are
times, frequently,
for nit' anywavs,
when \<>ti write and
it's almost automat
ic. It's like someone
else is moving vout
hand, hut lor me.
when vou're sitting
there kind ol
pounding your
head against the
wall. th.it's when the
bulk of the work
done.
Writer's block is
more about bow you

deal with it. In mx case. I pist soil of soldier
on and keep working and try to through
it and know (hat lots ol days are just going in
be one page a day and then, oute iu a while,
it will he eight pages. But it's really writer's
block when it stops you and you quit
How did you come to write so many stories
that are st) different in scope? All the
movies you've been involved with are so
distinct and don't really have a common
thread.
I lopctullv it's a good thing, you know. 1
guess it's chameleon on some level, which
has kind ola bad connotation to it. but it's
really |ust trying to write whatever il is that
interests me. I guess, at the time, and it's lun
to try different tilings. Because the one

tiling is. espet I.ll
ly in Hollywood,
is that once
you've done one
tiling, that's what
everyone wants
you to do. Like,
after "I. A. C'.on
lidential," it was
like everybody
wanted me to do
a cop thing, so
inv own nature
was to immedi
ately think that's
the last tiling like
that that I ever
want to do. 1 sort
of try to stay one
step ahead and
do something
different.
Because they
get nervous,
right? They say,,
"Well, this

works, so just keep doing it."
It (list makes their job easier the less tlie\
have to think about those things. It just be
hooves you as a creative person to not be so
easih labeled. I guess, hut then the\ start to
tliink that mavbe you cando am thing, you
know, which isn't necessarih true, but it
helps il \ou want to do something different
that thev don't expect from von.
When did you know that you'd really
made it in Hollywood?
I don't think I have. I have maybe, but,
in m\ own head. I don't think I've made it
vet. let me think Kven when I won the
Acadeim Award lot "L A. (.onfidential, I
remember walking oil stage and holding it
.ind I w.ts looking .ti it and 1 thought."()h.
ins (iod, now 1 have to win anotlici one."
Because one is .i llnke and anyone (.in
s.i\, "Well, that gu\ didn't deserve it. there's
no w,t\lt |iisi hit me when I w.is looking .it
it. somelxxh could .il\\.i\s jllsi s.n it w.ts .in
accident or vou luckv or something. I
gotta win another one to prove that I de
serve this one. So it's pist kind of weird. I
guess that's just my nature. I guess if I ever
made a movie that I thought was a perfect
movie, then I would think that I had made
it. but more defining it in a creative way
than in an accepting in Hollywood, or what

ever ili.it is, sort of way.
Where do you keep your statue?
I fonest to ( ><kl. 1 keep it in m\ closet, .til
wrapped lip in bubble wrap behind a box
with old letters in it. 1 used to have it in on
my desk, in front of my computer, but I'd
have to look at it .ill da\ Unit; and, one da\.
1 was )i ist like, hmrnm. and I wrapped it all
up and put it in the i loset. Not out of disre
spect — 1 really like it — but I just stuck it
awav. II I get another one. then I'll put
them out.
Then they would make a nice pair on the
mantle.
Yeah. I hen it's not a lluke then. You
have to have two, or it's a fluke.
Do you love what you do unconditionally?
1 here are days when it's really hard.
\\ i iting isdiflit ult, almost alwa\ s. but its fun
when vou finally have it and it's .ill done. It
feels more worthwhile, just for the struggle
of doing it. It's always better than anything
else I (ould do. And clirecting at tually is re
alb a jov. 1 ven the worst da\. when the worst
things happen, is kind ola reward fbi writ
ing bee ause writing is so solitary. and when I
write I get very anti-sot ial and don't leave m\
house for weeks .it a time. And then, with di
recting. if you can do both. \ou get to live
these t wo li\ es — one being a s<>litar\ life ami
the other life being around people. It's nice
that way.
Do you worry about critics?
Obviously, yeah. The thing with critics is
vou can't run around and read the good re
views and discount the bad ones, so, il \oti
embrace it. you have to embr.it e all of it. 1 lie
danger of it is that vou stat I second-guessing
yourself, which I think is really bad when
you're making films, so I try to ignore the
good reviews .is ninth as I ignore the bad re
views. 1 just try to make my film what 1 want
it to be and hopefulh it will be good and peo
ple will see it that wav. 1 don't discount the
dints — I |iist tr\ to not pay attention to
them because, il vou take them too seriously,
it will start to control vou. li will take away
voui instincts, which is probably the worst
tli.it will happen.
Where do you think that American cine
ma is heading today?
1 think where it's always been, reallv. 1
don't think it < lianges too much. It's one of
those tilings II tliev make ">OO movies a
year. five of them hopefully are going to be
great, good, really good. It was ahvavs a
business, vou know, and people look back
and they think that tliev used to make
great movies back then, but y\e don't re
menibei the SOO movies they made in
1940. of which yye only remeinbet the 10
great ones.
When they were making "Abbot and
(loslello," two-reelers and silly. kind ol bow
ery lioys stuff, tliev would always say, "Well,
let's try to make some really great movies,
too, so that we can get up in the morning and
be happy that there's a spec trum to the whole
thing," and I think there's less of that, proba
bly. There's almost a corporate viewpoint.
I hev were always a bin business, but there

was al
yv ay s
on e
g »' y
yv ho
y\ anted
to
make a
hit of
monev,

but still Have you ever noticed how everyone
wanted in tbe'4os wore a suit?
to make
good movies, like I lam Cohen or the Warn
er Brothers or any of those guvs. But now it's
all kind of. vou know, traded on the stock ex
change. and that's not good.
So Hollywood is definitely becoming too
corporate?
()h. 1 think so It's sut ha weird business, •
and nobody knoyvs how it works. 1 mean, il
you're making i ars. you know you've got to
press the sheet metal into fenders and it's a
science. But, no matter how corporate it
gets, there's something magical about why
a movie turns out the way it does, that
there's no formula for it, even though they
try to come up with one that yvill always
work No matter how much of an accoun
tant y on are. you know there's some kind of
weird iniunbo jumbo involved that you
can't quantify that always yvill make it dil
ferent than any other business.
*
I actually saw Michael Eisner speak last
week, and, in his speech, he tried to em
phasize that, above all, the movie business
is still about telling stories.
Whit h is y\hy it yvill always be kintla un
breakable. in a yveird sort of wav.
