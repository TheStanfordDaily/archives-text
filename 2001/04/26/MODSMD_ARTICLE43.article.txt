### CAROLINE SAKAMOTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"HISTORY BFGINS AGAIN,"
st ream ads and programs for the
IWrkele\ Reperton Iheatcr's
trilogy of plavs. I he Oresteia.
It's a fitting banner for (be
Rep, which pist opened a hand
some new (>OO-seat proscenium
theater onl\ tripping distance
awav from its older space. With
two stages, the Rep has room to

stretch and reinvent itself. I he
( hoii e ol I be < )i esteia, the
blood \ set of pla\s Ik tin the lather
of Western literature. Aeschylus,
is .ilso fitting, file st.nk. usceral
feel .mil look ol (ireck traged\ is a
breath of fresh air after this sea
son's contrived, fuss\ "Fall" in the
old theater.
I'he first plav in the Orestcia.
"Agamemnon. ' has the most fa
miliar storyline. Paris, prime of
I rov, has stolen the fair Helen

from bet husband, the Greek
king, Menelaus. Menelaus rushes
to I ro\ to wage war via the I ro
jau I lorse, along with bis brother,
Agamemnon. I he men return
victorious, but with more than
I rojan blood on their hands.
While at sea on the \\a\ to battle, a
fierce storm threatened to topple
the boats unless an offering w.is
made to the gods, and Agamem
non sacrificed bis daughter, lphi
genia. flie prophet Gassandra,

doomed b\ her jilted lovei Apollo
to s[)e.ik onb when she is telling
the Intlire — which no one will be
lieve — comes home with
Agamemnon as .1 concubine. All
of this is enough to turn Agamem
non's two-timing wife. (:l\ tcmnes
tra. a tiny bit crazy.
(Note: If all this is making your
head spin, tear not: I'he theater
lobby lias a lovely exhibit featur
ing an exhaustive lamilv tree of
Greek and Frojan gods and inor-

I.ils. .in well .is synopses of the
three pla\ s.)
Derrick Lee W'eeden, .» vocal
dead i inger for |ames Karl Jones,
plays Agamemnon. His stage
presence is commanding and
lc.ll some, and the mixed feelings
he experiences when he looks at
his wife are apparent. Her glance
is all it takes to bring him down a
couple of notches, and he avoids
campiness quite nicel\.
Rol>\ mi Rodriguez is .1 legal (ilvtemnes
tra, hut her action at the beginning ot the
plav is out ot sviu' with her horrifying deed
at the end. 1 lei manner is a hit too friend
ly .ind down-to-earth with the townspeople
when she awaits Agamemnon's return.
I here were ample opportunities in her
lines to convey the cobra-like nature lurk
ing beneath her elegant exterior, which
would have made her actions more believ

able. Rodrigue/ would also have done well
to modulate her voice more to add drama
to various scenes, but her final speech ol
|iistili( ation is riveting.
I rancesca laridanv's Cassandra is .1 re
freshing take 011 the familiar character,
shedding the hapless-wail c|iialit\ th.it rec ins
in main productions to reveal .1 stronger,
naked (literally) .itid tormented character.
Her portrayal of mental confinement
through physic al confinement is excellent.
It was a pleasure to listen to the (ireek
chorus in this production, something I
never thought I would write. Back 111 the
day, this was a group of old men chanting
the plot in unison. But here, directors

Stephen Wadsworth and loin Taccone
have the chorus, .1 group of men and
women with ver\ individualized person
alities. .it t out the lines as conversations
between themselves. It is engaging and
entertaining.
Robert l-agles' translation isn't (juite as
spare and stony .ts the decor on st.ige. t he
lines sometimes difficult to deliver fluid
ly. .ts mired as they .ire in metaphor. But
there's only so much you can do with .111 an
cient language.
Larry Delinger's music is another no
table .ispect of "Agamemnon." It's a spare,
cool percussion combined with the haunt
ing singing of the chorus. The use of per-

Mission I <» augment various spoken words
is etfe< tive, «nul the sinking natural.
rhe oilier two plays are "The Libation
Hearers ' and "The Kumenides." You can
see the production .<11 in one day, with
shows at 2 p.m. and .S p.m., as past pro
ductions of "Angels in America" and "The
Kentucky Cycle" have done. But on a stu
dent budget of limited time and money,
see "Agamemnon.' the most exciting storv
ofthe three.
I'he Rep offers a great discount pro
grain. with group discounts for 15 or
more, student rush tickets (cash only) and
the under-.'U) advance tickets (Sib any
night other than Saturday).
