Robert Martinez, (iln is Labi um
.ind Anne Ciregory hit the .111 waves
even weeknight at 9 p.m. on
SCBN .is the co-hosts ol the new
student-produced variety show.
" I he Scoop."
And Intermission was there,
front and center, to gel the scoop
on their new lives as comedians, co
hosts and campus celebrities.
We've seen the fliers around cam
pus and the promos on SCBN, but
in your own words, what is "The
Scoop?"
KM: " I lie Scoop" is actually the
shortened version of the Stanford
Scoop, vou see — like the show's
name is the Stanford Scoop.
AG: I don't think you want to
s.i\ what is "The Scoop," it's more
— what isn't " The Scoop"? We are
all "The Scoop."
(T: 1 hat was deep.
AC i: It's like you go to 31 flavors,
and vou get all 31 flavors — it's that
much of a scoop.
Okay. Your first show included
references to masturbation, oral
sex and anal sex, as well as
enough profanity to make Erin
Brockovich blush. Are there any
boundaries that you guys aren't
willing to cross?
AG: Um, crosswalk boundaries.
I'm going to stay within those and
obey the laws.
(T: All the stuff that you listed is
game for me, but. when it conies to
necking, just common necking,
that's too taboo for me.
KM: Yeah. Same with white
people. I won't 'diss' white people.
'Cause white people have the
money. And I know not to 'diss'
white people when they have the
money we're trying to get. But, as
far as masturbation — anything
sexual — I've done it all.
AG: He means he's seen it all.
KM: Seen it all, done it all. Same
tlimg. 'Cause those movies make
\ou feel like you're there, you know .
CL: 1 think pretty much, fresh

man year, we played "Crossing Tin
Line." and 1 crossed every time.
RM: 1 actualK was the onl\ 011 c
who did not cross when the\ asked
Who has never degraded tlu
other sex? I've never done that.
Except for on the show?
CL: But that's like acting —
that's not real degrading.
RM: I would never degrade
women 'cause that's who I like u
get the booh from.
What feedback have you guys re
ceived so far?

ACi: I have 50 stalkers alreadv
RM: 1 received an e-mail that
night from a girl, and now she's
part of the crew. She's prettv line. I

offered her Anne's
job, since she was so
hot But she didn't
want the whole host
thing; she was liappv
with the Held re
porter. So 1 gave her
Lilly's spot.
CL: You gave her
Lilly's spot? Are you
ever going to consult
me before you make
decisions anymore?
RM: My TA. My
teacher, she saw it. 1
think she liked it. Actu
ally, why I created the
show was to get girls.

AG: Has it worked?
RM: It hasn't physically
worked vet.
AG: Mentally?
RM: Some girls have thrown
out some signs.
AG: Those were the deaf girls;
they were trvitig to communicate
with you.
RM: I'm actually 111 the show
more now — the second show —
than I was 111 the first show.

CL: Really? That's hard to clo.
That's hard to put your face in any
more than you were.
How would you guys describe
yourselves — or each other?
AG: 1 like long walks on the
beach, a nic e strong man who can
keep me warm at night and keep

nit* — unim — cold during the dav
( T: A big strong guv keeps vou
cold during the da\ ?
\( i: 1 was |tisi trv ing to contrast
the warm at night.
CL: Anne is all about the 1 ontrast.
RM: 1 know last time I said that
I thought we three were the liinni
est people at Stanford. What I real
1\ meant to sav was. vou know how
like a mother lias a bain and the
mothei thinks the bahv is the most
beautiful c liild 111 the world . .
AG: Even if it's butt ugh.
RM: So that's how I look upon
('.lit is and Anne.

AG: We're butt ugly, but
we're his children.
(T: I love vou. Dad.
RM: Son!

CL: Does
that mean I'm
Mexi c an
now? ()r Mex
ican Ameri
can? I don't
know the I'.C.
word for it. ()r
w hat vou are?
RM: I'm
really a world

c hild. I'm mixed.
CL: You have a lot in you.
ACi: I'm part white.
RM: 1 figured you're part white —
being the white skin and everything.
CL: You are like KM) percent
part white. All your parts are white.
How did the ratings do on your

first week?
AC: The Nielsens? "Friends"
beat us out, and "t>o Minutes,"
which has a strong showing — and
I can't understand thai.
RM "Friends" couldn't beat us
out 1 ause we're not at the same time
slot — but we did actualK kick
"Kvervbodv Loves Ravmond's" ass.
AG: 1 think it's because "Everv
bodv Loves Rav 11101 id is realh \ ill
gai It goes places where its not
reach to go vet. And we're more of
a famih show
RM Ihe problem is,9o'cloc kis the

toughest
time sloi
111 prime
timc. And
it's hard
e 11011 g li
to do it
one
but we're
doing it
five
nights a
wee k .
And we're
k 1 c king
ass every
single
night.
AG: We

did really well 111 Ne
braska .ind Wyoming,
espet iallv Wyoming.
Are you guys not cen
sored?
RM: No. we're
not censored actually.
In our last show, we did
have some foul lan
guage...
(T: Brief nudity.
RM: Yeah, we
did have nudity.
(T: Strong sexu
al content.

RM: Really strong sexual content.
So w hat happened with editing on
the show's premiere?
RM: Well, we put a disclaimer
011 the beginning of the next show.
telling that it was not our fault.
CL: Yeah, there was no VI IS
formatting problem.

RM: It was hasicalh evervone
else's I.lull. Everyone else's 1 V w.is
I'm ked up thai night. And I suggest
that \<>u ( .ill Student (oinmunic.i
tion Services and eomplain.
\(. It's the little rats that live in
sult- the \ ( Rs that run the wheels
and make it work. I he\ were on
strikt- that night.
(IL: I 'nderpaid.
AC ■: Yeah, underpaid rats.
KM We don't promote ahuse to
animals — I don't want to get
I'E I \ on our .iss. I*l- I A is not the
one \ou want to tut k with.
CL: What's PETA?
AC.: People tor the Ethical
11 eatment ol Animals.
CL: So it's I'ET-A, hut pro
nounced I'E LV
\l.: Not I'ET-A. Which would
make more sense, 'cause like pet'
and 'animals.' But I think it's \ ause
the\ are really in to (.reek food.
Now did it feel splashing around
in a fountain for your opening
credits that parody "Friends"?
RM: It was really cold. Mv lower
body was numb.
C.L: Eor a second, though, I lost
sight ol Eitde Willie.
RM: Lots ol shrinkage.
AC i: I came out with a scrape on
tin loot. It's the piranhas.
C L: I lopelully people don't uri
nate in there, like we did.
Time for the mandatory Barbara
Walters interview question, lias
show business changed you?
AC">: Since I'm really not recog
nized yet, and since most people —
I'm below they're sight vision,
they're level ol vision ...
I.L: Eye level?
AC'.: Yeah. I haven't been recog
nized by anyone vet.
C!L: I don't think it has
changed me.
RM: Of course, you don't return
people's phone calls anymore.
AC i: He's got the bodyguards now.
RM: True. Bodyguards,
bovliiends — whatever.

who did not cross when the\ asked
Who has never degraded tlu
other sex? I've never done that.

CL: But that's like acting —
that's not real degrading.

women 'cause that's who I like u
get the booh from.
What feedback have you guys re
ceived so far?

ACi: I have 50 stalkers alreadv
RM: 1 received an e-mail that

Lilly's spot.
CL: You gave her
Lilly's spot? Are you
ever going to consult
me before you make
decisions anymore?
RM: My TA. My

even weeknight at 9 p.m. on
SCBN .is the co-hosts ol the new
student-produced variety show.
" I he Scoop."
And Intermission was there,
front and center, to gel the scoop
on their new lives as comedians, co
hosts and campus celebrities.
We've seen the fliers around cam
pus and the promos on SCBN, but
in your own words, what is "The
Scoop?"
KM: " I lie Scoop" is actually the
shortened version of the Stanford
Scoop, vou see — like the show's
name is the Stanford Scoop.
AG: I don't think you want to
s.i\ what is "The Scoop," it's more
— what isn't " The Scoop"? We are
all "The Scoop."
(T: 1 hat was deep.
AC i: It's like you go to 31 flavors,
and vou get all 31 flavors — it's that
much of a scoop.
Okay. Your first show included
references to masturbation, oral
sex and anal sex, as well as
enough profanity to make Erin
Brockovich blush. Are there any
boundaries that you guys aren't
willing to cross?
AG: Um, crosswalk boundaries.
I'm going to stay within those and
obey the laws.
(T: All the stuff that you listed is

that's too taboo for me.

people. I won't 'diss' white people.
'Cause white people have the
money. And I know not to 'diss'
white people when they have the
