What an utter bore. There
couldn't be two less interesting
people than Florence and Richard,
played bv Moll\ Parker and Peter
Sarsgaard, respectively. I nfortu
natelv. though. 1 had i<> sit through
"The ('.enter of the World," an un
rated feature th.it is (hock full ol
sensationalist garbage and monot
onous stares into the distance.
To its credit, "("enter" does pro

vide some thought-provoking par
allelism between Florence and
Peter's differing "centers of the
world." Florence is a stripper at a
gentleman's dub, so naturally her
(enter is clown below. Th.it is
where she makes her money and
where all life springs forth.
For Peter, however, the com
puter i> king. I le has made millions
through I P()s and m<h k portfolios.
mi naturally the Internet is Ins cen
tei That i>« where he makes all his
mone\ and, consequently the t en

ut of his subjei 11\t* world.
Florence and Peter embark on a
journev to sort through feelings
and sexual boundaries in the glitter
capital of the world: Las Vegas. I
got distrat ted into thinking that I 'd
like to go there soon, .in escapist
spirit not unlike the one spewing
from the film. I he t\u> had set up
rules beforehand to ensure that
this trip — paid for.and then some,
In the millionaire — goes accord
ing to plan. Nothing ever does in
the world of t inema. however.

Director Wayne Wang, who has
never been a favorite of mine, is
best known for his crossover bit
" The |o\ Link Club." Since then,
he has released various pieces of
trash, iiic hiding the Susan Saran
don / Natalie Porttnan vehicle,
"Anywhere but Mere." and "Chi
nese box." <i melding of Hong
Kong and American values with
C.ong 1.1 and Jereim Irons. Wang
simph tries too hard in this film to
find meaning in the most ridicu
lous of settings and setups.

For all of the hoopla surround
ing the supposedly erotic "(".enter."
the movie is more of .1 whimper
than .1 hang. Aside from an earh
lollipop scene and an oil-screen
"lire .md ice," I think ihis is fat less
lurid than 1 expected. And it's .111
even higger waste of time than I
had ever dreamed it would be. es
pecially lor all ol the attention it
had gotten as the opening night
show lor the International l ilm
Festival here in San Francisco.
