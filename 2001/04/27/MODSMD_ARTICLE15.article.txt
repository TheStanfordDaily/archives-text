1955
On April 27. 1955, Ihe Daily printed an article
about Lake Lagunita.
"Lake Lagunita might make i( 'til the end of the
quarter yet — if the rains continue.
"I niversitv Superintendent of Buildings and
(•rounds (larroll L. Blacker s.iid vesterdax that if it
should rain.»tew more davs this week there might he
enough water flow to raise Lagunita's declining level.
" I he rains ol late haven't affected the lake at all.
according to Blacker, who said that the water has
herelv heen absorbed In the ground, with no over
flow into Lagunita.
"()l course, it the rains come down hard enough
the matter of the hike's supposedly weakened dam
will again present itself. If Lagunita's level does get
'dangerously' high it can be drained."
Bottom line: Don't think we need to worry about Lake Lag
overflowing this year.
