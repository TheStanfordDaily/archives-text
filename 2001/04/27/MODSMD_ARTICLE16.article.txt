According to Stanford Advcxates tor
Children, thousands of children m San
Mateo Count\ have no health insurance
Ixrause their parents arc unaware of the
opportunities tor tree or low-cost health in
surance. Stantord Advcxates tor Children
will try' to get the word out on this issue In
holding a Healtln Families mass enroll
ment and .1 health t.iii tomorrow in Fast
Palo Alto ( itv 11 all from 10 a.m. to I p.m.
I lealthv Families is ('.alifornia's version
ot the Children's Health Insurance Pro
gram. 1 he program is a national one de
signed tor families who earn too much
inonex to oualih tor Medicaid, but still

cannot afford private insurance.
Stantord students w ill Ik- helping to en
roll families that tall into this gap into the
Hcalthv Families Program. "Twentv-five
students have been trained to till out the
applic at ions to enroll families, and 10 other
students have volunteered to help thetla\
of." said Frit a ( hung, a senior and co-di
re( tor ot Stanford Advcxates toi ('.hildren.
l he idea for this event came about
aftet members ot Stanford Advcx ates for
( hildren helped with a similar event held
in Santa ( lara County. Members helped
out with mass enrollments in S.ni |<>se, but
realized that San Mateo ( ount\. especial
l\ Fast Palo Alto, needed an enrollment ot
its own.
"We have been intensely planning this

event since last quarter, but we've had the
idea in our heads all veat and I'm reallv
excited that it's .ill coming together,"
('hung said.
Chung also stressed that the mass en
rollment was not solelv ten the people in
Fast Palo Alto. "Though we are having
this event in Fast Palo Alto, we are not
|ust targeting FPA, but also neighboring
cities like Redwood ( itv and Menlo
Park," she said.
Aside from tlu' enrollment, there will
also be a health fair component, which is
ex pec ted to help draw families to 112 halt In
families. I he health fair will consist of or
ganizations from San Mateo Countv.
I here w ill be booths, food and face paint
ing for the kids, among other ac ti\ ities.

"We're hoping this event will be suc
cessful enough so that other groups in San
Mateo County can see that this can be
done and needs to be done," said Alic ia
|ohnson, a senior and co-director of Stan
ford Advocates tor Children.
"We ate obviously not going to get all of
the children enrolled, which is why we
want to do well enough so that people w ill
want to tr\ this again,' Johnson said.
Members of Stanford Advcxates for
Children s.iv thev hope to get as many
c hildren enrolled as possible. "()ur goal is
tocnroll HOO kids. We nia\ be reaching tor
the stars, but it's good to set high stan
dards," ( hung said.
Stantord Advcxates for Children was
started in the spring of 1998. Members

help to raise campus awareness on chil
dren's issues. The Healthy Families mass
enrollment and health tan will Ik- the first
time the group docs a mass enrollment on
its own.
The organization lias been involved
with such children's issues as juvenile ins
til e, education, childcare, i hild health and
school vouchers.
"We analyze issues for voters in the
community, and we bring in speakers to
debate the issues," |ohnson said. "We
don't usuallv do direct service with tliil
dren â€” this event is the closest thing."
