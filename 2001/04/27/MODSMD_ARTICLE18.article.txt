absent from historical timelines and analy

by providing a forum for witnesses
those who lived through the partition ol
Last and West C ierniany, India and Pak
istan, and North and South Korea, and
those who continue to face the violence in
Northern Ireland — <1 chance to share
their personal experiences with the larger
Stanford community.
I lie project's organizers have wisely uti
lized the I niversitv's vast resources and
connections to invite speakers who can
contribute to promoting a better under
standing of world conflict. Bringing 111
Ka\ Area residents to provide personal

narratives of particular turning points in
history lends credihilitv and urgencv to
scholarlv inquiries. Ihe programs pro

In educating students and stall ahout
world conflicts, main ol which are ongoing,
these programs oiler a look outside the
proverbial Stanford bubble. Most students
cannot take trips to Northern Ireland <>i
North Korea to learn ahout the issues alien
ing these areas, but the\ can attend a lalk on
the partition ol Korea and meet people who
have not seen their families lor 50 wars.
I hrough lectures, teach-ins and films. Stan
ford communit\ members can develop and
deepen their understanding ol lorn of the

world's most fascinating regions without leav
ing campus.
Ihe project's multimedia showcase, featur
ing documentaries and colorful exhibits, pre
sent the issues in accessible, fun formats. While
.» clear benefit for the audience, the exhibits
•11 so allow the student volunteers to explore
historical topics in creative and meaningful
w.i\s. hoi example, producing a short film on
am one of the loin regions lets students use
then skills to stud) historv without having to
write papers. I'lie events, which continue next
week, oiler important and rare opportunities
lot met libers of the Stan lord commit nit v to ex
pose themselves to historical periods and world
hot-spots. We applaud the I niversitv for sup
porting such innovative programming and
commend the organi/ers for bringing living
histon to ( ampus.
