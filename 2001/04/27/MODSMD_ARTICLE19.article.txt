I'm sure that nianv of us will
eventually beconie successful and
rich individuals. And I'm pretty
sure wr will attempt to rationalize
our own elitist existence as "profes
sionals with the idea that we are
doing something worthwhile. We.
the non-athletic majoritv, believe
ill.n we are more desening individ
uals — that brain should and will al
wa\ s be held in a higher regard than
hi aw n. Bet anse throwing a baseball
ai 100 miles pei hour, or shooting a
basketball accuratclv or running

talent and not a developed skill like
the ones tli.it have resulted in
framed degrees hanging framed on
our walls.
" Those spoiled athletes, p.iitl to

think, as we brag to our friends
about our new lv pin t based court
