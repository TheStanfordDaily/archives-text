dience. I he debate grew heated at several points, es
pecialh in response to the question of whether the
I niversitv's Nike contract constituted an endorse

Abernath\ and Reluii argued tli.it prcssuiing aili
letcs to wear Nike's tradcniai k "swoosh" on thcil uni

versity's image.
I'.tilieniend\ and I .eland countered that wearing
the enihleni was not a politic al statement on the part
of the students or the I nivcrsitv, and that it was
preferable to the alternative of requiring athletes t»
purchase their own gear.
Speaking first, Abernatln outlined the abstract
principles that led to liin com lusion that Stanford v
student-athletes should not bet (impelled to weai uni
forms emblazoned with the Nike symbol.
"(lontracts should be between institutions." Aber
nath\ said, arguing that the burden of deciding no
to wear Nike apparel should not be plat ed on intli
vidual students. " Hie I niversit\ titles not have tin

"Student-athletes are the ones
who benefit Iroin these sponsor
ships." Ktchemendy said, lie
went on to s.i\ that, without such
contracts, student-athletes would
be forced i<> p.i\ for their own
equipment.
[.eland argued against "letting
politics intrude into sports" bv

to surrender some rights, such as
freedom of speech on the field and
the right to fair compensation for
their work.
Rchni said he believed the issue
was essentialh a decision between
accepting the easy money and tak
ing the moral high ground bv re
fusing to advertise fora corpora
tion iliat engaged in child labor
and unfair wage practices.
"The contract with Nike- is
about advertising," Rehm said.
"Should the University be in ilic
business of advertising? No."
" I o contract students to adver
tise fora corporation is not a fair
requirement." he continued.
During the qucstion-and-an
svvei session, opponents ol the
Nike deal raised questions about
the pressure on student-athletes to
"go with the flow" bv bearing the
swoosh and about the possihilin ol
Stanford joining ilu- Workers'

Rights Consortium, a group of
universities that have committed
to ac tively investigate Nike's labor
practices.
Kitheinendv didn't address the
option of joining the consortium
during the debate; when asked
about it later, he said that "Nike is
alreadv a member of a couple of
these same kind ol organizations.'
Despite their differences of
opinion, the panelists managed to
retain tlic-ir sense- ol humor; at one
point. I.eland admitted that he did
not "make a living bv poking holes
in other peoples' arguments," to
which Relun re-plied, "Hut, led,
vou make a lot more- inone\
"I don't 111iii k the- parties
reached consensus, but an ex
( hange ol ideas In reasonable peo
ple who disagree is constructive,"
Satz said aftei the debate.
Relun expressed disappoint
ment with ilu- lack of progress

that has been made, given that the
time of signing the contract close
at hand.
"[Ktc hetnenelv's] public stance
shows no growth from anything
I've heard him savin the past five
months on this issue," Relun said.
"| A debate] is onlv productive if
we're actuallv listening to one .in
other, and it's ni\ impression that
Provost Ktc hemendv is not really
listening to Prof. Re-Inn's argu
ments." said sophomore club
sport plavei Patrick Iber after the
debate.
"After tonight, I'm much more
sure . . . that Stanford athletes
should not In- coerc ed into repre
senting Nike. ' said Lauren Diet
rich, a varsit\ women's lacrosse
plaver who opposes the- contract.
hui I know the Athletics Depart
ment's top priorit\ is the best 111-
te-ie st of the athletes, and the\ do a
good job ol supporting that."
