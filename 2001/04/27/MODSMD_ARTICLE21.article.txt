Feminists need to 'pay attention to
the complexity of our shared history'
While I applaud Son in Foster's efforts on
behalf of "single women with unexpecled preg
nancies," I was taken aback bv her inaccurate
representation of feminist activism and historx.
Pro-choice feminists do not locus on "en
couraging abortion" as Foster (barges; in
stead. pro-choice individuals and organiza
tions have long fought for the economic and
legal supports women need to raise children
on their own. Pro-choice feminists simplv rec
ognize something that Foster does not: Re
gardless of am support the\ might enjoy,
some women will still choose to terminate
their pregnancies.
Women make this decision foi main rea
sons: 1 hex feel that thev are too voting to be
responsible parents, tliex do not want to sub
ject themselves to the phvsical and emotion
stresses of pregnant x or (hex simplv feel that
motherhood does not accord xvith their iden
tities. While pro-choice and pro-life feminists
can and should work to provide pregnant
xvotnen xvith options, we cannot ignore the tact
that some women will still seek abortion for
personal reasons.
Foster's claim that many first-wave femi
nists. "including Flizabeth C'.adv Stanton.
Susan B. Anthonv and Claire Boothe were
strongly opposed to abortion" also needs crit
ical examination. While manv earlv feminists
opposed abortion, thev also opposed the
kinds of contraception that we take for grant
ed today, largely because thev feared that men
would demand more sex from their wives ab
sent the threat of additional children.
First-wave feminists wanted women to be
able to use their fertility as a marital bat
gaining chip, and thus they opposed abor-

tion along with the pess.ux and other ton
ti ac cptixc dex it es. 1 lie t onccpt of women s
sexual pleasure was entirelx absent from
these discussions, xxhich took place in a
medical and moral climate fat different
from our oxvn.
If feminists on both sides of I he abort ic >11 de
bate are to work together, we c an onlx do sobx
fairly and act uratelx representing one anoth
er and In paxingattention tothet oniplexitx of
our shared bistoi x.

representation of feminist activism and historx.
Pro-choice feminists do not locus on "en
couraging abortion" as Foster (barges; in
stead. pro-choice individuals and organiza
tions have long fought for the economic and
legal supports women need to raise children
on their own. Pro-choice feminists simplv rec
ognize something that Foster does not: Re
gardless of am support the\ might enjoy,
some women will still choose to terminate
their pregnancies.
Women make this decision foi main rea
sons: 1 hex feel that thev are too voting to be
responsible parents, tliex do not want to sub
ject themselves to the phvsical and emotion
stresses of pregnant x or (hex simplv feel that
motherhood does not accord xvith their iden
tities. While pro-choice and pro-life feminists
can and should work to provide pregnant
xvotnen xvith options, we cannot ignore the tact
that some women will still seek abortion for
personal reasons.
Foster's claim that many first-wave femi
nists. "including Flizabeth C'.adv Stanton.
Susan B. Anthonv and Claire Boothe were
strongly opposed to abortion" also needs crit
ical examination. While manv earlv feminists
opposed abortion, thev also opposed the
kinds of contraception that we take for grant
ed today, largely because thev feared that men
would demand more sex from their wives ab
sent the threat of additional children.
First-wave feminists wanted women to be
able to use their fertility as a marital bat
gaining chip, and thus they opposed abor-

tion along with the pess.ux and other ton
ti ac cptixc dex it es. 1 lie t onccpt of women s
sexual pleasure was entirelx absent from
these discussions, xxhich took place in a
medical and moral climate fat different
from our oxvn.
If feminists on both sides of I he abort ic >11 de

fairly and act uratelx representing one anoth

Alcohol not x/fidespread
during Admit Weekend
I lie "alcohol-related incident" puhliclx re
ported in Brandi Yasouka's attic le "Alcohol pol
icy e\.mlined (April 24). although not an inci
dent unic|uc unto itself, was not < li.irac (eristic of
the atmosphere and student social inteiaction
during the recent Admit Weekend. As a
prospectixe freshman person.illx op|>osed to al
cohol consumption, I xvas pleased to be intro
duced to several current students x\ho do not
engage in drinking alcohol and feel |iist as in
cluded in events without pressure from peers. It
was clear, .it times, that alcohol consumption is
enjoyed by main students, but not In all.
1 commend the Admit Weekend c oordina
tors, house hosts, room hosts and others in
volved xvith organizing the ex ents forensut ing
that non-alcoholic bcxerages xvere not |ust an
alternative but. tor the most part, the exclusive
option at planned events. Members of the
Cireek system at Stanford acted appropriatelx
by cjuicklx asking prospective freshmen to
leave (.reek events (even drv ones).
Furthermore, I applaud the students x\bo

I i.ul iht- pi t'si.'iu col mind and ethic\s to call 911
when the incident became too serious lot
them to handle, although it is disappointing
that current students also made these bever
ages available to the prospective freshman
when both were aware of the extreme conse
quent es tor these ai lions (up to and including
rest hiding of admissions oflei s).

SCBN's "The Scoop" needs to try harder
I took the time on Wednesday night to
watt h Hie Stoop" on SCBN, and 1 don't be
lieve anvone at ibis I diversity should be sub
ject to this nightly 9 p.m. piece of trash. I
ditln t laugh a single time during the entire
show. It this is the wav S(.BN is going to
spend its special fee money, then I call fora
referendum dirt ion immediately to revoke
.ill of the t lianiicl s funding ft>r the upctuning
st ht)ol year.
No one as unfunny, unoriginal and untal
ented as the people who work on this show
should ever receive a dime of students'
money , which would be better spent on a
book of I aniih (.irtus cartoon strips that
would undoubtedly evoke more laughter
than the shameful (iO-minute debacle I just
watt bed. I know that the show is young and
still developing, but just a quick note to the
writers and performers for upcoming shows:
Try harder.
