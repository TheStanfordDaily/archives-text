ell reported yesterday.
"We're doing it quietly, without
a billboard announcement even
day." Powell told a I louse panel as
he hinted at potentially produc live
sec ret I .S. contacts.
President Ceorge W. Uusli iti
tervencd with a telephone call to
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ol Is
rael. Shedding little light on their
conversation, White House
spokesman Ari Fleischei s.ud they
talked about "ways to secure peace
in the region."
On another front, Lebanon's
prime minister, Rafik Hariri, who
saw Bush on 1 uesdav and Powell
on Wednesday, said his "impres
sion is they are as committed as
much as President C llinton was, but
they want to use different tactic s.''
Powell agreed that leaders in
the Middle Fast have the impres
sion that the region is not a pi un i
ty for the Bush administration, but
he said that is not so, I iariri told re
porters over breakfast yesterday.
()ne indication of change is that
the CIA. whose role was being re
duced by the Bush administra
tion. has begun acting as a "facili
tator" between Israel and the
Palestinians.
Agency spokesman Mark Mans
field said Wednesday that l)cput\
Director |ohn McLaughlin be
lieves "our role is not to negotiate;
it is not to mediate; it is to provide a
venue and invite people to come to
a meeting hosted by someone w ho

does not have an ax to grind."

l'enet plaved a high-profile role in
negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians.

But the new governments in
Jerusalem and Washington agreed
this vear to reduce CIA involve
ment. Ihe Palestinian Authority,
on the other hand, wanted a larger
role tor the intelligence agency.
