Stanford (IW-10, 11-4 Pacific 10 Conference) enters the sc
ries clinging to a one-game lead in the Pac-1() with just nine
games remaining. l.ast weekend, the (lardinal dropped two of
three games in Los Angeles against No. t> Southern California
to relinquish half of its two-game cushion over the Trojans in
the conference standings.
Typically, public address announcers update conference
scores throughout the ballgame, making coaches and players
on the field well aware of the happenings around the league.
"Anv of us would be lying if we said we don't care what the
scores are," said head coach Mark Marquess. "You can score
board-watch a little bit. but 1 think if you're a good team you c an
still concentrate on the task at hand."
I bis weekend, that task is the Cardinal's biggest rival, the
(lalifornia (.olden Beat s. 1 lu- Bears (24-21,9-9) staved with the
Cardinal for three straight games in March .it Sunken Dia

Stanford managed just eight runs in the series against solid
California pitching. But soon after the Bears went back ac ross
the B.iv. the ('.ardinal bats heated up. Stanford's offense has im
proved dramaticalh from its opening stretch, posting run totals

of 11. I <Sand 22 in the last two and one-half weeks.

but eac li time he pla\ sand does something for the first time, the
better he becomes."
Marquess emphasized that freshman ( al ios Qucntin should
see better pitches with (loopei behind liini at the cleanup spot,
and that (looper's return max help everyone in the lineup be
