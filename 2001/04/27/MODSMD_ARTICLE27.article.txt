With six freshmen bringing so much new
talent to the squad, it is no wonder that the
('.ardinal was better than it had ever been. I he
new gymnasts were loaded with national ex
perience and some international experience
as well. 1 he freshmen added tremendous
depth to the team, filling four or five of the six
spots on each event.

from knee surgery, Stanford did not have as
much room to shuffle the lineup.
Even without two of its ke\ gymnasts, the
squad still had a deep talent base. 1 lie Cardi

the top six teams at nationals, and. to make it
possible, Stanford put in long hours in the g\ in
