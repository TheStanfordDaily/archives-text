## 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR EDITORIAL STAFF 
With roughly 22,000 entrants,
the Penn Relays boast the title of
the largest track meet in the world,
with a tradition that stretches back
to 1895. The meet plays host to
athletes ranging from high school
to Olympic-level from over 10
countries. And right in the middle
of it all are some of Stanford's own.
The Stanford men's track
team, which has won both the
four-mile relav and the two-mile
relay in the past, will be sending
seven of its finest to Franklin I ield
at the University of Pennsylvania
this weekend to try to capture .in
other victory.
"It's a competitive situation,
and it's relays, so you're doing it .ill
with youi teammates," said head
coach Robert Weir. "It's a great
meet .nul a great tradition. It's .i
chance for oni guvs to showcase
themselves."
I he Cardinal clan headed to
the Penn Relays has already done a
lot of sho\v< so f.u tins season,
turning in some of the top perfor
mances in the nation. Fogether,
the combination (ould be lethal.

over the weekend.

so far this season, finishing in
3:58.54, 4:01.34 and 4:01.89, re

Stember, who advanced to the
semifinals in the 1,500 in Sydney,
leads the Pat-10 and is second in
the nation in his marquee event
with a time of 3:41.80. Sage is onl\
two seconds back, good enough for

third in the conference and 10th in
the nation.
The versatile Riley, who
clinched an automatic qualifier in
his career debut inn of the 10,000,
leads tlit- Pac-10 and is second na

third fastest in Stanford's history.
Stanford's two-mile relay

Mark Hassell, who rank second
(1:49.73), third (1:50.10) and
fourth (1:50.38), respectively,

the win.
Sage and |ennings will also
team up with junior Kvan Keltv
and Stevens for the distance med

and Kelty were members of the
Stanford I)MR squad that set a
world record with a timeof9:2S.S3
at the NC.AA Indoor Champi
onships.
Stanford will certainly not
struggle from lack of competition
this weekend, but, without peren
nial powerhouse Arkansas, eyes
will be on colleges like Florida,
(Georgetown and Kentuckv, which
have all posted impressive times
this season.
"At this time of vear. vou want to
increase the pressure .uicl face
stiffer competition." Weir said.
"You really want to challenge
yourself. I his meet will have new
competition, a different atmos
phere and a diflerent feel, so vou
can rcallv see how vou stack uo."
