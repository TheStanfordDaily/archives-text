## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
It is a classic battle: the environmental
ists versus tlu- industrialists, the tiger sala
mander versus the new building project.
Now it's the Committee for Creen
Foothills versus Stanford I niversitv,
deadlocked in a fight over land use.
On Mav 8, the Santa Clara Countv

Board ot Supervisor will vole on the late
of the Carnegie Foundation's long-await
ed move to tin- Stanford Foothills. Pro
posed in 190S, the move would give the
foundation a 51-year lease on 21,000
square feel of land just west otjunipero
Sena Boulevard, near the golf course.
Currentlv housed in the condemned
SRI Intelnational building in Menlo Pat k.
the foundation serves as a think tank lot

research and polic\ studies on teaching
and learning.
Its stated mission is "to do and perform
all things necessai \ to eiu on rage, uphold
and dignih the profession Â«>t tea* lung.
Fhe Santa Clara County Planning
Commission originally approved the
foundation's move to the Foot hills on Nov.
2, 2000. Fhe Committee for Creen
Foothills appealed the decision on Nov.

1 !i, on the grounds that the plans \iolated
both Stanford's current general use per
mit and the new general use permit that
was pending at the time.
()n Marc h 20, the Board ot Supei visors
reviewed the proposal, and Santa Clara
Countv Supervisor Li/ kniss suggested
that the Carnegie Foundation work with
the planning commission to modifx its
plan before the filial vote in Mav.

Win all the hiss about building a small,
rustii'-looking clustet of buildings on the
old Latluop Dairv farm? fo Kniss, the
issue is a test case for the new general use
permit, in which Stanford pledged not to
build in the 112 oothills foi _\> years.
Environmentalists worn about the im
pact the buildings would have on the habi
tat of the threatened (California tigct sala
mander and about the precedent that
would Ik- set In compromising the coni
munitv plan.
"[ I lie proposal! was a blatant viola
tion of the new conununitv plan, which
established protections tor the Stanford
Foothills," said Denice Dade, legislative
advocate tor the Committee lot (ireen
Foothills.
At the Mat i li 20 meeting, the Board of
Supervisors outlined tluet* main objec
tions to tlu* building plans.
First, portions of the development
would tall outsi(le of Stanf(>rd's apprc>ved
academi( growth bound.u v. Second, the
buildings would exceed the 200-fbot
height barrier, detracting from views in
the area. I hu d. the plans did not indue!
adequate protection of the tiger salaman
der's habitat.
Kniss recommended th.tt the best wa\
to achieve these goals would be for Stan
ford to offer the foundation a different
site, c loser to the core campus.
According to Larrv Norton, Stan
ford's director of government and coni

niunitv relations. 110 other site on c ampus
is feasible.
"Fvervthing we need to do in the fu
ture needs to go on the (ore campus,"
Norton said. "I ndei the plan approved
In the counh 111 the general use permit,
we have to put all <>l out at .identic build
ings and all of 0111 student housing for
the next 2f> vcars 011 the core campus,
which is onl\ '20 percent of Out land."
File foundation recentl\ announced
modifications in its plans to accommo
date some of Kniss's requests. However,
supporters contend that their plan hasal
wavs been consistent with enviroiiment.il
regulations.
"It is a ver\ low-impact structure."
Norton said. "It is a wliollv appropriate
site, it alreach lias development 011 it. 11
will be nestled 111 there where it isn't visi
ble from the road, and it lies entii el\ with
-111 the boundai ies approved 111 the gener
al use permit," I torton said.
Carnegie Foundation spokespeople
have said that, if the board does not
allow them to move onto the site ciii
rentlv undei consideration. tlic\ 111.iv
have to move out of Santa ( laia ( ountv
altogether.
According to spokeswoman (lav
Clvburn. other venues 111 Silicon Vallev
would be "financiallv prohibitive, and we

would have i<> cut back some ol our es
sential programs [to aflord them]."
Following the Maivh 20 meeting of
the Hoard ol Supervisors, Carnegie
Foundation treasurer |ohn Bancroft was
overheard discussing plans to move the
think tank to \orth Carolina, according
to the San I ram isco ( luonicle.
In a press conlerence alter the meet
ing, Bancroft lamented that the board s
dei ision "inake[s| it unavoidably and per
manently latal lor the ( arnegie Founda
tion's proposal."
I eai hers and others involved in edu
cation have turned out to support the
foundation, which is one of the oldest
non-profit 01 gani/ations in the country.
"1 lulh support the mission of the
Carnegie Foundation," kniss said in a
press release, "but I cannot support the
i ui i cm proposal until ii lulls conforms to
mil land use laws and until we have ex
hausted even effort to find an alternate
core-campus site."
I his is not an issue of whether
('.arnegie is a gre.it institution, but simply
ol land use and of conforming to the law,"
1 )ade said.
Whether conforming to the law entails
sta\ ing out ol the Foothills will be a mat
tei for kniss and the other board mem
bers to decide in Mav.
