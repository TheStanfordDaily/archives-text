### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
\ Pat if it 10 (lonfeiencc title — the

taste it this week.
But despite another outstanding
final round, the \o. I Cardinal still
finished three strokes hat k of the de
fending Pac-10 ( hampions, No. 2 Ari
zona. and took second place instead.
Wonder il the players are a little
liungiA now?
Slightly, to sav the least.
I he runner-up finish was, In no
nleans, a major letdown for the inem
bei s of the team. Stanlord was one of
three top-five teams competing in the
event, and with host No. 13 Arizona
State making a late-season c harge, it
was cleat that the Pac-10 would hold
the most highly contested conference
( hampionship in the nation.
I lie (lardinal didn't disappoint,
shooting its best thrce-da\ total of the
vear (S7(>> to finish seven strokes
ahead ol the 1 ad\ Sun Devils and 10
strokes higher than the Women of
I ro\. It was Stanford's sixth straight
lop-five finish.
"We were prettx pumped going
into the tournament, and we were
prettx successful." said freshman Kim
kouwahunpat, who had her highest
finish of the year on the 0,101-vard.
