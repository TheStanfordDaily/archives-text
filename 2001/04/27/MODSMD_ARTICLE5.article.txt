l ania ljonibro/o, a junior majoring in phi
losoph\. organised the conference.
Ijonihro/o. who is also one of the two presi
dents of the Undergraduate Philosophy Associ
ation, explained that the student speakers .it the
conference are usually Bay Area authors who
have submitted works to the "Dualist," the un
dergraduate journal of philosophy.
i his year, however, there were no submis
sions from ilie Bav Area, so the association de

cidc-d to have honors theses in hthic sin So< ietv
and philosophy presented.
" The main purpose of the journal and con
ference is to give nndergi aduates an opportuni
ty to participate in an academic conference as
professot s would. lx>nibro/o said.
Senta Georgia, a senior majoring in biologi
cal sciences and philosophy, is giving a talk ti
tled "Genetic Knhancenient: ( an l air Equality
of Opportunity Pass flu* lest?" Based on (ieor
gia's thesis in Ethics in Society, the talk ex
plores the question of how genetic enhance
ments should be distributed fairly throughout
society.
"I haven't had the opportunity to present my
work in a phil<>s«>phical t cintcxt and get feedback
for tnv thesis, (Georgia said. She s.iid the confei -
cm e will provide a chant e for her to do just that.
In addition to the student presentations,
there will be two papers presented bv Binge
and 1 .aw lor.
Lombro/o explained that Burge was chosen

because the group wanted "someone who is fa
milial to undergraduates ... He i> read by
them or could present .1 topic that would appeal
to undergraduates."
I .awlor will present "Staking a (.laim: I low to
Karn Kntitlement to Your Beliefs,' which will
compliment Bulge's paper, titled "Perceptual
Kntitlement," and raise questions about his
view.
Lawlot said that the conference is an oppor
tunity for undergraduate students who may
otherwise only have their thesis read In a few
professors to get more broad-based exposure.
"I think it's really nice when students can take
written work, present it to a wider audience and
get feedback," 1 .awlor said. "Having that kind of
outlet is great."
According to Lombro/o, the association
may, depending on how well this goes, have
two conferences in the future — one for hon
ors theses and another for submissions to the
"Dualist."
