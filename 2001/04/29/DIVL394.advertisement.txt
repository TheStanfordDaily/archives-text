Stanford Institute On Reading And Learning
Announces RESEARCH FUNDING On
Methods For Understanding And Diagnosing
Reading Disabilities In Young Children
The Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation has provided a generous gift to Stanford to study reading and
learning disabilities. Based on this gift, the Stanford Institute on Reading and Learning (SIRL) has been formed,
under the initial direction of Neurology Professor and Chair Bill Mobley. SIRL will have a basic mechanisms
component (including such areas as neurology, genetics, psychology, psychiatry, education, linguistics), a research
and diagnostic clinic (to identify individuals with learning disabilities, classify and quantify those disabilities, and
find appropriate treatments - which could involve engineering fields for assistive technologies), and a think tank
component to address public policy implications of reading disabilities, evaluate current methodologies to deal
with them, analyze data, and disseminate the findings of the other divisions of SIRL for maximum public use and
benefit.
We believe Stanford has the collective expertise to make tremendous progress in reducing the problems that flow
from reading and learning disabilities. In order to encourage you to turn your expertise toward this problem, SIRL
will offer several rounds of research funding for Stanford faculty, post docs and graduate students over the next two
years, with each round focused on a particular aspect of reading disability.
The first round of proposals under the basic mechanisms component is now being solicited for awards to
be made in July of this year, as follows:
Research Topic and Criteria: proposals are solicited for periods of one to three years that examine methods
for diagnosing, understanding and treating reading disabilities in young children. We encourage proposals that
examine this topic at levels ranging across classroom measurements, behavioral testing, neuropsychological meas
urements, or at the cellular and molecular level. We are particularly eager for studies that bridge these different
levels of analysis. We anticipate that some proposals will be submitted from multiple laboratories whose members
wish to study this area jointly. The Institute will be able to provide resources for experimental design and data
analysis.
Process and Deadline: proposals of no more than five pages (including project period, detailed budget,
and anticipated results) should be submitted by June Ist to Dr. William Mobley, Interim Director of SIRL and Chair
of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, at 1201 Welch Road, Stanford School of Medicine, MSLS Building.
Room P2ll (tel: (650) 723-6424. They may be sent by II) mail, email (to NGFVl@stanford.edu) or by fax (650)
498-6262.
We will restrict requests to a maximum of $100,000 per year and will encourage the submission of
proposals in the range of $50,000 per year so as to capture the involvement of as many scholars as possible. We
discourage the use of these funds for faculty salary.
Proposal Evaluation and Selection: Proposals will be reviewed and ranked by the SIRL Steering Committee,
consisting of Stanford faculty members William Mobley (Chair). Professor and Chair of Neurology and Neurological
Sciences; Brian Wandell, Professor of Psychology; David Rubenson, RAND Corporation; Allan Reiss, Professor of
Psychiatry; Ellen Markman, Professor of Psychology, Linda Darling-Hammond, Professor of Education; Neil Risch,
Professor of Genetics; and Roger Noll, Professor of Economics. Final selections will be made by the SIRL Board,
which consists of both Stanford faculty and external experts.
Awards: Awards will be announced approximately July 15th, 2001, with the funding made available imme
diately thereafter. Funding for successful proposals will be guaranteed for one year Additional years of funding
will be subject to review of progress reports by the SIRL Board. In addition, faculty funded by this mechanism will
be expected to take part in SIRL activities.
