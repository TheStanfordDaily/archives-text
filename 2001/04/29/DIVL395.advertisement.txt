Acne
Acne - pimples and blackheads
- can appear on your face, chest,
back, or shoulders. It is caused
by an excess of oil and skin cells
that plug up your pores and
enable bacteria to overgrow. You
can effectively treat many cases
of acne yourself.
Self-care
*
■ Wash with a mild soap (i.e.,
Dove, Neutrogena); don't scrub
■ Avoid squeezing or picking
pimples (can cause infection or
scarring)
■ Avoid oil-based makeup, sun
screens, lotions or hair
products
■ Use benzoyl peroxide (i.e.,
Oxy 5 - 10) every night
If your acne does not improve
after two months of self-care, if
you have large red or purple
bumps under your skin, or if your
acne causes significant scars,
schedule an appointment at
, Cowell.
Moles
Moles are growths on the skin
that usually (but not always) are a
different color from the skin
beneath them. Although most
moles are harmless, some may be
melanomas, which are cancerous.
People with fair skin and light
• eyes and a family history of mela
noma are more vulnerable to skin
cancer.
Self-care
Check your skin from head to toe
every six months. Include your
lips, eyelids, back and scalp. Look
for moles that:

■ Are changing in size, color, or
shape
■ Are larger than a pencil eraser
■ Have uneven colors or color
that is spreading to the
surrounding skin
■ Have irregular edges, uneven
shape, or become bumpy
■ Itch, bleed, become painful,
and don't heal within two
weeks
Warts
Warts are growths on the skin
that are caused by a group of
viruses (Human Papilloma
Viruses or HPV). Most types of
warts (excluding genital and anal
warts) are not highly contagious.
They may spread to other areas
on the same person, but rarely
spread to others. They are not
dangerous, but can be annoying.
Plantar warts occur on the soles of
the feet (you may feel like you're
walking on a stone).
Self-care
■ Salicylic acid is available over
the counter (solution, gel or
patch)- follow the directions
on the label
■ If the wart does not respond
to treatment or causes pain,
schedule an appointment at
Cowell
The Sun
There are no safe tans. A suntan is
your skin's response to injury
from ultra-violet (UV) light.
Tanning increases your risk of
skin cancer and causes premature
aging. You don't have to be able
to see the sun to be at risk (80% of
UV light comes through a cloud
cover). UV light is also reflected
off water, sand, and snow, and is
more intense at higher elevations.
Self-care
■ Avoid sun exposure during
peak hours (10:00 am to 3:00
pm)
■ Wear protective clothing (i.e.,
hat, long sleeves) when you're
outside
■ Apply a sunscreen with an
SPF of at least 15 a minimum
of an hour before exposure,
and reapply frequently, espe
cially when swimming
■ Keep your mouth covered:
apply a lip balm with sun
screen often
■ Wear sunglasses
■ Some medications can make
you more sensitive to the sun
(i.e., some antibiotics); ask if
yours does
■ Do not use tanning booths
■ If you want to look darker, use
artificial (sunless) tanning
lotions 0
