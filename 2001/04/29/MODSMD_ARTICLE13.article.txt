Most of us probably expect the
eight-campus University of California
system will admit a 112 reshman class
that reflects the state's ethnic and
racial diversity.
What may come as a surprise is
that Stanford, long regarded, particu
larly by UC-Berkeley students, as a
bastion of elitism and exclusivity, ad
mits a freshman class that is nearly as
diverse as the UC system.
Of the 46,1 30 students admitted to
the UC system for the fall, 52.3 percent
are from minority groups, including
15.6 percent who are African Ameri
cans, Latinos and American Indians.
At Stanford, the incoming freshman
class of 2,416 students is 49.9 percent
minority, including 27 percent
African American, Latino and Ameri
can Indian.
