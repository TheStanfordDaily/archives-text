At April 18-19 talks in Beijing,

ship it out in pieces.
"Having completed its investi
gation and evidence collection in

Xinhua also said the United
States lias agreed to consider mak
ing a payment to (lliina. It did sav

two sides will conduct more nego
tiations "on the spec ific amount ot
the I S. payment and the items to
be covered."
Cheney said the I nited States
will pay all costs in bringing the
plane back, but has no plans to
compensate Beijing for the
collision.
"We will pay whatever costs as
sociated with recovering the air
craft in terms of transportation,
barge, cranes, whatever is re
quired to get it back out," he said.
Xinhua said the two sides re
cently held several rounds of talks
in Beijing on the plane, though it
wasn't immediatclv clear whether
the news agency was referring to
the talks previoush disc losed.
It said discussions on a "final
settlement" ot the issue u ill contin
ue and the two sides will explore
wa\ s to avoid similar incidents.
