## JUST A BIT OUTSIDE A
						tribute to Brianna 
### 
Drai Brianna,
Fi ida\ was sii< li ,i beautiful tla\. 11
was warm, tlie* sun was out, and.
as I walked ovrr to the Quad,
hikei s passed me on all sides. Off
in ihr disi.iiu e, I could hear the Stan
ford Baud plaving Paul Simon's "Obvi
ous ( Inld. and. later, "All Right Now."
When I got to the Quad, rows of white
folding chairs were set up to face toward
Palm Drive. A microphone and a pit ture
<>112 vnii stood m Intnl. I sat down and

w .111 hi'd .ts niceh
dressed people s|owl\
walked to the seals.
I lint laces were lar
100 voting lor the sor
row ilk'\ expressed.
Some wore sunglasses
to covet 111> the leais
slied heneath.
I hen vour friends
liol III) lo I.ilk .lllOllt

von. \ « »ii miisi have been something.
Hi i.iima. to haw friends like these. I he\
all spoke so well. I he\ read poems,
plaved instrninenls and (old stories
141 eat slot ics.
I heard about voui desire to go to
(luatem.ila lo work with poor women.
You'll be happ\ to know that vour par
ents have sci up a fund, in voui honor, to
help women's literal \ there. I heard
about how vou learned (iernian, then
Spanish, how vou scored a perfect I,(>()()
on vour SAT, how vou once hiked IS
miles when vou wci e eight \ eai s < >ld and
how vou were training loi the Lincoln,
Neb., marathon tins past vcar.
And I heard about vour spunk,
about vour /est lor life. Whv does n
seem that main ol those who appreci
ate life the most, who live it to its fullest,
are tai 100 oltcn taken awa\ from us
earlv? Mavbe. with people like vou, it
w ill alwav s be too e.u l\.
Your friends thanked vou. 1 he\
thanked vou t'oi making them laugh, loi
making them appreciate life. I hc\
thanked you lor making sure the\ took
time out to go camping and to read Walt
Whitman's "Leaves ol (ii ass."
Alter the ccrcnionv. aliei all ol those
nil el\ dressed people placed dallodils In
the pit turc ol vou, I walked voui li ieud
and Ibrnier head advising associate, 1 )el
pliine. across campus. She seemed so

thankful to enjo\ part of your far-too
brief life.
Four doors down the hall. I hat was
the distance von traveled each evening
to tell Delphine about your dail\ adven
tures. I don't know if you knew it then,
hut those moments brightened her days.
I here she was, plugging away into the
earh hours of the morning, and you
would come in with a smile on your face,
teasing her for working too hard. You
would tell her about the gre.it moments
of vourda\. whcthei it was a wonderful
hike you took or a great let ture you had
enjoyed — despite the loads of reading
that, unlortunateh, came with it.
Delphine also told me about the lime
vou gu\ s went out to eat at Zao, the noo
dle biir on I'niversity Avenue. You
loved the dish vou had so much that vou
wanted to learn how to cook it. Del
phine laughed. You were being sillv:
I low could vou took tliisr Hut vou were
determined, and, so. you asked the
restaurant lor the ret ipe.
Brianna, I am so verv sorry for vour
family, for yoin friends, for vou. It
doesn't seem right that vou were taken
awa\ altei onl\ I*o wars 011 this earth. It
should remind lis how precious life is. It
should remind us how we must never
take things foi granted; how we must
wake np even tla\ and be thankful for
the gift of life.
It would be In pot 1 itical for me to ex
pet t evcrvonc to live this vvav. I often get
( aught up in the dav-to-da\ woi lies that
t tune with being a student here. I let my
self get wot ketl up owi small things, hut
I shouldn't. It wouldn't be fair. Not to
Mm. Not to someone who valued life so
111 lit h. Not to someone who wouldn't
lake it lot gianted.
I don't know win it's so eas\ to forget
that lilt- is fragile. I guess because we
have to plan ahead to survive, and. 111
planning ahead, we convince ourselves
that tlieie will be a future But the future
is not guaranteed, and, when I stop and
think about it. n seems so important to
appi c< iiite evei \ thing.
Brianna. I ridav was such a beauti
ful tlav.
Hi inn i tilt' would like to thank those who or
ganized the loveh memorial service fOl linan
na (termer. You may reach him at
