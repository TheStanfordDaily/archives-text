University shouldn't 'lower
standards' for athletes
While "athletes work hard, too," as Ar
isha Match pointed out in hci Friday col
umn, I think her defense of college athlet
ics is based on some very incorrect as
sumptions and also desi t ibes some of the
major problems with college sports. First
and foremost, college sports definitely do
not make a lot of monev. In fact, at most
schools, even the big name sports of foot
ball and men's basketball lose money.
It goes without saving that smaller
spot is like golf and su miming lose monev
bei ause of their I.u k of c rowds, but it is a
until that college sports make mone\ for
the I nivet sit\. I lowever, 1.1111 not in favor
of abolishing college athletics simplv be
cause thc\ lose monev. High school sports
definitely lost monev as well, but I think
the\ were an essential pai t of main of our
lives, and college sports should be as well.
1 just don't agree that any university
should lower its standards simplv to field
bettei teams. Wli\ can't college sports be
like high school — you simplv pick the
best plavcrs from youi student bodv. I un
derstand this would be the end of college
sports' role as a sort of minor league fbi
professional sports, but I think this would
return a great ileal of integritv to all uni
\ei situ s. 1 his would result in a decrease in
(|ualit\ of college sports, but high school
sports were still fun to watch, even if ev
ei\one wasn't a top-class plavcr.

Presidents have their limits, too
1 bis is .i short note of protest regarding
your April L'S editorial ("( onununication
kc\ to successful presidency"). While there

is a perpetual obligation of a university
president to communicate fully and fre
quently with all campus stakeholders,
there is also an obligation placed upon
these constituents to understand and re
spec 1 die myriad t omplexdeniandson the
chief executive's time and priorities. I his
is no less true for students.

Editorial provides no
'factual evidence'
I he recent April 21 editorial ("Athletics
department too strong, independent")
was one of the shabbiest pieces of writing 1
have ever read. Instead of using tactual ev
idence to bat k up the claim, the piece was
full of innuendo, vague references and
snide remarks.
A Stanford freshman might get the im
pression from the editorial that our De
partment of Athletics wields incredible
power over the University, and that l ed
belaud s every wish was granted by for
mer University President Gerhard
Casper. If this is the case, why does our
football team play in one of the oldest and
most rundown stadiums in the Pacific 10
Conference? Whv does our top-five
men's basketball team play in the smallest
venue in the conference? Is Lcland's im
mense influence only powerful enough
to move .1 proposed residential housing
project from one side of ('.ampus Drive to
the other?
You also seem to think that the Athlet
ics Department can get any top recruit
through the admissions process safelv.
but vou offer 110 evidence to support this
erroneous claim, other than snide refer
ences to" Temptation Island" and "(.bains

ot Love." If you liaci done any research at
all, you would have discovered th.it just re
cently, a top football recruit, Lorenzo
Alexander, was turned down by admis
sions and will suit up for our rivals across
the Bay this fall.
I he statement that (lasper was an "avid
supporter of Stanford athletics" is also
false. Who do you think lead the campaign
to rid our athletic facilities of advertising?
Casper was known on occasion to read a
hook in the press box during football
games. A few nice publicity photos with the
Sixth Man (Hub members did not make
(lasper a great friend to Stanford athletics.
Finally, with .til the University land
available for housing, you never ad
dressed why it was necessary to ruin a part
of Stanford's history and tradition to build
on that particular site. Frankly, 1 expect
better journalistic integrity from The
Daily. Next time, please do a little research
so you don't embarrass the paper again.
