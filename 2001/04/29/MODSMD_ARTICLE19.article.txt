Sadl\, the teal world (or. as 1 like to call
it.the (ire.it Cosniii Hamster Wheel) is

So w hat can we do. other than sacrifice
a few goats to Alan (ireenspan? Is it time

('.aim Yourselves, people. Our hon
ored leaders are formulating plans to
deal with the current crisis. President
(ieorge W. Hush, alter carefully examin
ing the situation and frowning thought
fulh. has announced that he "is currently
wearing an enormous hat." In addition,
he has proposed a substantial tax cut to
stimulate the economy, which will defi
nitely work. I nless it doesn't.
I may not he a world-class economist.
In fact. 1 .1111 still fascinated by the trans
action where I give people small, green
pieces of paper, and they give me stuff.
However, 1 have compiled .t list of'com
mon-sense measures that should be
taken in order to finance the tax cut,
boost productivity and otherwise im
prove morale to jump-start the economy.
Any musician or group that utilizes a
painfully obvious rhyme (love-above,
heart-start, fire-desire) will pay SI each
time said rhyme is plavcd on the radio, $2
for rhyming a word with itself. You can

easily see the benefits of this one, as the
government will collect $17 billion from
the Backstreet Bovs alone.
Regis I'hilhiti will be imprisoned with
out trial, along the with entire casts of
" Temptation Island" and "Survivor 2."
I'm not sure how this will affect the econ
omy. but n can't hurt. Why Regis? I am
reminded of a certain Bible passage:
"And 10. Satan did come forth, and his tie
was the same color .is his shirt."
Women will be taxed $1 each time
they tell me that 1 am "like a brother" to
them. Another huge cash intake.
Bill\ the Singing Bass will explode
upon depression of the "on" button,
thereby eliminating the wasteful human
refuse who buy that kind of thing.
(Sorry, Mom).
Decaf will be secretly outlawed, creat
ing a huge increase in productivity. Star
bucks is forced to release the IV drip bag
caffeine / amphetamine blend that
they're currently holding oil'the market.

(Don't call them for samples. They're re
ally stingy).
Anyone who attempts to buy a sport
utility vehicle that exceeds the si/e of an
Akula-class nuclear submarine will be
whacked in the forehead with a hardcov
er edition of Marx's "Das Kapital." Their
tnonev goes directly to the autoworkers.
In order to raise the morale of the
American public, gladiatorial games will
be revived. 1 be only participants will be
I nited States senators, and their mode of
combat will be forcible liposuction.
On second thought, I'll probably just
applv fora coterm program and stay in
the womblike embrace of the Stanford
campus for as long as I can. Until then.
I in off to the local goat merchandiser.
You're on vour own.

We might as well admit the obvious:
I he golden age is over, (ione are the
<l.i\ s when Silicon Valle\ venture capital
ists would throw millions .it von for com
pleting a semi-coherent sentence con
taining the word "Internet." (iod forhid
you s.iid "B2B." because von would
probably be crushed under tailing bales
of money. Iu the headv times of our fore

Sadl\, the teal world (or. as 1 like to call
it.the (ire.it Cosniii Hamster Wheel) is
looking slightb less appealing in its latest
incarnation. I nwashed dot-coinmers are
burning piles ol stock on street corners
simply to sta\ warm and trying to pan

So w hat can we do. other than sacrifice
a few goats to Alan (ireenspan? Is it time
to go scurrying into those investment
banking seminars? I see cheerful fliers ev

('.aim Yourselves, people. Our hon
ored leaders are formulating plans to
deal with the current crisis. President
(ieorge W. Hush, alter carefully examin
ing the situation and frowning thought
fulh. has announced that he "is currently
wearing an enormous hat." In addition,
he has proposed a substantial tax cut to
stimulate the economy, which will defi
nitely work. I nless it doesn't.
I may not he a world-class economist.
In fact. 1 .1111 still fascinated by the trans

pieces of paper, and they give me stuff.
However, 1 have compiled .t list of'com
mon-sense measures that should be
taken in order to finance the tax cut,
boost productivity and otherwise im
prove morale to jump-start the economy.
Any musician or group that utilizes a
painfully obvious rhyme (love-above,
heart-start, fire-desire) will pay SI each
time said rhyme is plavcd on the radio, $2
for rhyming a word with itself. You can

easily see the benefits of this one, as the
government will collect $17 billion from
the Backstreet Bovs alone.
Regis I'hilhiti will be imprisoned with
out trial, along the with entire casts of
" Temptation Island" and "Survivor 2."
I'm not sure how this will affect the econ
omy. but n can't hurt. Why Regis? I am
reminded of a certain Bible passage:
"And 10. Satan did come forth, and his tie
was the same color .is his shirt."
Women will be taxed $1 each time
they tell me that 1 am "like a brother" to
them. Another huge cash intake.
Bill\ the Singing Bass will explode
upon depression of the "on" button,
thereby eliminating the wasteful human
refuse who buy that kind of thing.
(Sorry, Mom).
Decaf will be secretly outlawed, creat

Anyone who attempts to buy a sport
utility vehicle that exceeds the si/e of an
Akula-class nuclear submarine will be

In order to raise the morale of the
American public, gladiatorial games will
be revived. 1 be only participants will be

combat will be forcible liposuction.
On second thought, I'll probably just
applv fora coterm program and stay in
the womblike embrace of the Stanford
