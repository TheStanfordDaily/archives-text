WASH INGTON (AP) — Top
aides to President Bush marked
his 100 th dav in office yesterday bv
declaring he'd brought new civili
ty to policy debates in Washington.
Democrats dismissed the claim,
and aired ads bitterly at
tacking Bush as a captive
of special interests.
"We don't talk, we don't negoti
ate, we don't really collaborate and
work together on these policies,"
said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo. "It's really been
more of the same — my wavor the
highway, in the Gongress everv
dav on every issue."
I ligh-ranking administration
ollit ials took to the airwaves bear
ing .i ditlcrcnt message: that Bush
had delivered on his promise to
improve the tone in the nation's
capital.
" I lie president lias changed
lilt- wax Washington talks about its
job," said White House Ghief of
Staff Andrew (lard on AB( s "This

Week." "Civility is back in Wash
ington, and Democrats and Re
publicans can have a disagreement
without being disagreeable, and
that means th.it we can get work
done tor the Americ an people."
As evidence. Bush political ad
viser Karl Rove s.iid the president
had successfully pushed fora
major tax-cut package.
" The support is growing for the
president's initiative, and it's
growing in the halls of Congress
and across the country," Rove said
on NBC's "Meet the Press."
Asked why the Senate had ap
proved a tax cut of $1.2 trillion
over a decade, far short of Bush's
proposed Sl.ti trillion plan, Rove
said: "We're going to get a signifi
cant I.ix t ui, a big tax cut, when a
year ago people said we ain't going
to get it, and three months ago, 97
or 9H davs ago, people were coun
seling us to toss it overboard."
I he Bush aides faced tough
questioning on Bush's policies on

the environment and consumer
protection laws, and even Sen.
John Breaux, a Louisiana Democ
rat who has emerged as a Bush
ally, was critical of Bush's leader
ship on the environment.
"1 think they've handled it fair
ly badly," said Breaux. "1 think
t hey scared a lot of American peo
ple, and that's certainly not good
for anyone."
Democrats pounced on those
issues in their I V ads, timing them
to air just as Card and Rove were
touting Bush's achievements on
Sunday news shows.
One ad criticized the ad
ministration for attempts to
roll back regulations, show
ing a little girl asking for
more arsenic in her water and
a little boy asking for salmo
nella on his sandwich".
Rove brushed the ads olf as
"almost laughable." And Card
said of Bush, "He's a great
conservationist."
