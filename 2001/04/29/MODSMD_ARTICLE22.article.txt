CAP! CANAVERAL, I la.
(AIM — Space shuttle I ncleav
our and its crew undoc keel from
the international space station
yesterday, wrapping up a long.
fra//ling \isii that was wracked
hv computet trouble but finalh
ended in sin cess.
Left behind were the three
space station residents, who had
just I I hours to get reach for
their next guests: two Russian

space toui ist.
Mission Control relieved the
space station crew ol almost all
its duties, including computet
repairs and robot-arm tests, to
make time foi what one manag
er calls entertaining but what
amounts to bain -sitting the visit
ing California millionaire.

"Coodbve and wc wish \ou a

when Endeavour pulled away

had a functioning hard drive.

It was a lot ofwoi k getting to

Roniinger and his crew are
due back on Earth on l uesdav,

is considered the most compli

I he shuttle is returning one
of the space station's failed c om
nia nd-and-c out rol computers;
the unit was i eplac cd aboai d
the oi biting c omplex with a
pav load computer.
I Ins will he- just one more
clue to help us solve this prob
lem.' said Robert Cabana, a
spac <■ station manager.

Flight controllers will spend
the next week — and probably
longer — testing the space sta
tion computers and working to
bring them up to 100 percent.
F.ven if all three command*
and-control computers fail
again. the space station could fly
the way it did before the units
arrived with the Destiny labora
tor\ in February, said Randy
Stone, director of mission oper
ations. A pair ot computers on
the I S. L'nity module would
suffice.
"We have a lot of options to
fault down through. Some of
them wouldn't be very pretty,
but .ill of them would be safe,"
Stone said.
( abana said the pace should
slow down considerably this
week for space station residents
|nn Yoss, Helms and Yuri Us
achev, the commander.
" I liey're going to have plenty
of ust over the next week or
so . . . we're not going to be
overloading them at all," Ca
ll.in.i s.iid. "They'll just be enter
taining the visiting crew and liv
ing aboard the space station."
NASA expects Voss and
Helms to have enough time to
practice using the newly in
stalled robot arm before space
shuttle Atlantis arrives in June.
I he shuttle will deliver a pres
sure c hamber for spacewalking
astronauts that must be installed
bv the new arm.
