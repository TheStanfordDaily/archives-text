## Strong relays foster teamwork for Cardinal track 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR EDITORIAL STAFF 
When competing in track and field, it is often diffi
cult to find the team in team sport. Individual events,
personal records and focus on \( AA qualification de
tract from a sense of teamwork and leave little time to
reflect on the team as a whole.
1 lie Stanford men s track team already knows how
to do well individually. Five of its athletes lead the Pa
cific 10 Conference in their respective events, while 1(1
others rank in the top >. But at this weekend's world
renowned IVnn Relays, Stanford had a chance to do
well together.
I alents combined nicelv for the C .ardinal as t he men
captured both the four-mile and two-mile relay titles.
With 75,000 screaming fans watching your
every move, the athletes have a c hance to really be
showcased," said head coach Robert Weir. "The
I'enn Relays are over 100 vears old, there's a strong
and very rich tradition. If you win — it's like, 'Wow!'
It's a big deal."
Fhe Cardinal four-mile relay squad did just that,
and in record-breaking style. Redshirt freshman
Seth Hejny, freshman Donald Sage, redshirt junior
Jonathon Riley and co-captain Michael Steinber
shattered the mark set in 1998 bv a foursome that
both Riley and Steinber were a part of. T his year's
time of 16 minutes, 15.7 seconds, bettered 1998'sef
fort by nearly eight seconds.
"We had a bunch of great guys out there, some of

the best milers in the country," Hejnv saicl of Stein
ber, Sage and Riley, who have all posted mile times
in the top 10 nationally this year. "With guvs like
that, it's pretty hard to lose."
Hejny, who is currently sixth nationally and third
in the Pac-10 for the 5,000-meter run, showed Ins ver
satilitv by competing in both the four-mile and two
mile relavs this weekend. I hough tlu- typically long
distance runner was only scheduled to run in the
four-mile relay, Hejny stepped in to relieve redshirt
sophomore Jonathan Stevens for the two-mile relay.
Stevens competed in the distance medley relay for
the Cardinal, but an injury kept him out of the two
mile relay, which was intended to feature the second,
third, fourth and seventh fastest half-milers in the I'ac -
10 — Steinber. Stevens, co-captain Mark I lassell and
senior Ryan ('.at roll.
"Seth Hejny stepped in, and the nun's l\Boo
won, Weir saicl. "That's what team effort is .ill
about: One guy goes down and another steps up
and comes in."
Finishing in 7:19.39, the foursome edged out
Kentucky bv one-half second tor the win.
"We don't normally get to do a lot of relays,"
Hejny saicl. "It's really great to be able to share
something like this; it helps everyone come togeth
er in a team environment that's like no other."
