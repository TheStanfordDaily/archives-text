# New school record set at Penn Relays
## 
### BECKY BLANCHARD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At this weekend's Penn Relays,
one of the largest track and field
meets in the world, the Stanford
women didn't have am trouble
with getting lost in the crowd.
I hey blazed their wav through
it.
Sparked by a second-place fin
ish in Fhursdav's distance medley
relay, the squad returns from the
weekend with two runner-up titles,
a new school record and a whole lot
of confidence.
Granted, going into the Penn
Relays, the team was already riding
high on its success at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays the previ
ous weekend. However, any lin
gering doubts about the ('.animal's
ability to perform under pressure
were erased after this weekend's
outstanding showing in front of a
packed crowd at I-ranklin Field.
On I hursdav, redshirt senior
Jayna Smith ran a blistering 53.2
seconds over 400 meters to best
her own school record of 53.62,
< locking the fastest lap of'the event
and leading the ('.ardinal to a sec
ond-place finish in distance* med
ley relay. Redshirt senior Sally
Glynn got out to a quick start in
the opening 1.200-meter leg.
Glynn handed off to Smith just
fractions of a second behind
North Carolina's Beth George.
The battle between the Cardi
nal and the Far Heels was close

w
over the next two legs. Smith's
smoldering 100 drew the two
teams even over the first two legs.
|unior Lindsav Hvatt ran a 2:09.7
half-mile u> bring the competition
to the final leg, the 1,600 meters.
In the end, sophomore Lauren
Fleslunan couldn't catch North
Carolina pheuom Shalane Flana
gan, who kicked in an impressive
4:34.3 mile.
Fleshinan's time of 4:45.3
brought the Cardinal across the
line just ahead of third-place
Georgetown in 11:15.07. The
squad just missed its chance at
breaking the school record of
11:06.23, set a year ago by Glvnn,
junior Danielle Spurlock, Hyatt
and Fleslunan at the Drake Relavs.
Stanford brought the momen
tum of its distance medlev relay fin
ish to the track on Friday. I wo of
the members from that relay,
Glynn and Fleslunan, joined red
shirt senior .Ashley Couper and
sophomore Frin Sullivan in the
Ix 1,500-meter relay.
Director of I rack and Field Yin
Fananna had predicted a strong
showing from the Cardinal in this
event, and the Stanford women de
livered. I hey edged Georgetown
for the second time, but couldn't
top a formidable Arkansas team,
which included distance stars
Fracy Robertson and Filli klein
tnann. Stanford got its second run
ner-up performance of the relays
