lacrosse team (11-5, 7-0 Women's West
ern IxHTosse League) added one more
victory to its perfect WW 1.1. record and
got one step closer to its fourth consecu
tive WWLL championship.
In the Cardinal s first postseason com
petition, the three-year defending cham
pions defeated the St. Mary's (>aels ((Â»-N).
12-9, at St. Mary's Stadium in Moraga.
Saturday's match was an emotional and
fast-paced contest, and St. Man's loss
marked the end of their season.
The game began with a quick goal
from the Gael's leading scorer, Megan
Brvan. But the first minutes of the match

three unanswered goals from freshman

necessarily always play smart," said head
coach Michele I hllclder. "We were slop
py in a lot of areas, and a team with so
much emotion can capitalize on our
turnovers and mistakes."
