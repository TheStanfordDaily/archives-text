I his weekend, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team (11-5, 7-0 Women's West
ern IxHTosse League) added one more
victory to its perfect WW 1.1. record and
got one step closer to its fourth consecu
tive WWLL championship.
In the Cardinal s first postseason com
petition, the three-year defending cham
pions defeated the St. Mary's (>aels ((»-N).
12-9, at St. Mary's Stadium in Moraga.
Saturday's match was an emotional and
fast-paced contest, and St. Man's loss
marked the end of their season.
The game began with a quick goal
from the Gael's leading scorer, Megan
Brvan. But the first minutes of the match
was the only time that St. Mary's would
hold the lead, as Stanford responded with
three unanswered goals from freshman
Abbi Mills, sophomore Liz l~ine.se and se

nior co-captain Katharine Barnes.
For the remainder of the first half,
both teams went goal for goal until I fills
scored to end the half with Stanford up
7-3.
I he Cardinal started the second half
with a goal from junior Caroline Oster
wise in the first minute of play. The rest of
the second half, however, was a challenge
for the Stanford squad.
" I heir team was fueled off of heart
and emotion," said freshman Larissa
Conte. "We got frantic and let emotion
run the game."
The St. Mary's team played with inten
sity and proved that it would put up a
fight until the final whistle. The Gaels
hustled all over the field and were win
ning the 30-50 balls in the midfield.
"We had trouble hanging onto the ball
in the midfield," said freshman Katie
Grube. "Although we were able to catch
many of the balls, we would either drop

the ball or throw it away."
"We always play hard, but we don't
necessarily always play smart," said head
coach Michele I hllclder. "We were slop
py in a lot of areas, and a team with so
much emotion can capitalize on our
turnovers and mistakes."
I he last time the teams met, Bryan was
a threatening player and a challenge for
the Stanford defense. ()nce again, in Sat
urday's match, Brvan's unconventional
stvle of plav and shovel shot allowed her
to score four goals against the (lat clinal.
"Megan likes to drive to the goal."
Conte said. "Her combination of size,
strength and determination to score are
what make her such a threat."

the second half with aggressive play and
hustle. However, Stanford's transitional
defense was impressive and helped the

I his weekend, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team (11-5, 7-0 Women's West
ern IxHTosse League) added one more
victory to its perfect WW 1.1. record and
got one step closer to its fourth consecu
tive WWLL championship.
In the Cardinal s first postseason com
petition, the three-year defending cham
pions defeated the St. Mary's (>aels ((»-N).
12-9, at St. Mary's Stadium in Moraga.
Saturday's match was an emotional and
fast-paced contest, and St. Man's loss
marked the end of their season.
The game began with a quick goal
from the Gael's leading scorer, Megan
Brvan. But the first minutes of the match
was the only time that St. Mary's would
hold the lead, as Stanford responded with
three unanswered goals from freshman
Abbi Mills, sophomore Liz l~ine.se and se

nior co-captain Katharine Barnes.
For the remainder of the first half,
both teams went goal for goal until I fills
scored to end the half with Stanford up
7-3.
I he Cardinal started the second half
with a goal from junior Caroline Oster
wise in the first minute of play. The rest of
the second half, however, was a challenge
for the Stanford squad.
" I heir team was fueled off of heart
and emotion," said freshman Larissa
Conte. "We got frantic and let emotion
run the game."
The St. Mary's team played with inten
sity and proved that it would put up a
fight until the final whistle. The Gaels
hustled all over the field and were win
ning the 30-50 balls in the midfield.
"We had trouble hanging onto the ball
in the midfield," said freshman Katie
Grube. "Although we were able to catch
many of the balls, we would either drop

the ball or throw it away."
"We always play hard, but we don't
necessarily always play smart," said head
coach Michele I hllclder. "We were slop
py in a lot of areas, and a team with so
much emotion can capitalize on our
turnovers and mistakes."
I he last time the teams met, Bryan was
a threatening player and a challenge for
the Stanford defense. ()nce again, in Sat
urday's match, Brvan's unconventional
stvle of plav and shovel shot allowed her
to score four goals against the (lat clinal.
"Megan likes to drive to the goal."
Conte said. "Her combination of size,
strength and determination to score are
what make her such a threat."
St. Man 's captured the momentum of
the second half with aggressive play and
hustle. However, Stanford's transitional
defense was impressive and helped the
