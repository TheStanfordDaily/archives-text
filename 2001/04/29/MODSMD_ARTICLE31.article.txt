PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — After
dispatching Portland in three easy
games, Shaquille (VNeal sa\ s the self
ish, bickering Los Angeles 1 bikers of a
month ago are long gone.
And the happv bunch that re
placed them is primed to continue its
march toward a second straight NBA
title.
"Everyone is on the same page
now. We have a mission," O'Neal
said after the Lakers beat the 1 rail
Blazers 99-80 vesterdav to sweep
their first-round series.
"If we keep playing like this, it's
going to be verv hard to beat us, said
O'Neal, who led the Lakers with 25
points and 15 rebounds. "We know
what it takes to win a c hampionship,
because of the phenomenal season
we had last vear."
Los Angeles will play the Sacra
mento-Phoenix winner in the sec
ond round.
Kobe Brvant had 22 points and a
playoff cat eer-high nine assists, and
Derek Fisher added 17 points and
eight rebounds for the Lakers, who
began their surge In winning the last
eight games of the regular season.
Portland, meanwhile, lost for the
sixth straight time and 17th time in
25 games. Lhe team with the high
est payroll in NBA history — $89.7
million — faces an offseason of un
certainty. Coach Mike Dunleavv
could be tired, some players could
be traded, and even general man
ager Bob Whit silt's job isn't safe.
"1 felt like we had too many c li.il
lenges, too main obstacles to over
come," said Scottie Pippen, whose
goal of a seventh title was thwarted
by jealousies, the departure of
Shawn Kemp for drug rehabilita
tion and a season-ending injury to
Bon/i Wells.

'This is the worst — the worst
thing 1 have ever had to deal with
throughout my career," Pippen
added. "It just wasn't a fun season
lor us. I he outcome of it was just a
testament to what we had been
dealing with all season."
Damon Stoudamire and Steve
Smith each scored 25 points to lead
the Blazers, and Rasheed Wallace
had 13 rebounds but was a major
disappointment on offense, missing
IT> of 19 shots and scoring nine
points.
1 he Lakers say they are better
than last year's team, which blew a
3-1 series lead against the Blazers in
the conference finals and had to
overcome a 15-point fourth-quar
ter deficit to win (lame 7.
"Our confidence is at an all-time
high, and we caught a team t hat is not
all the way together," Fisher said.
The teams split the season series
2-2, but Los Angeles utterlv domi
nated the Blazers in the playoffs,
outscoring them by 44 points and
outrebounding them by 83.
Lhis series showed how tar
we've come, how much we've ma
tin oil." Bryant said. "Last year we
didn't have the know-how, but this
\ ear we have the experient e. And in
this series, at the end, we took the
life out of them."
The Lakers beat the Blazers the
same wav thev did the fit st two games
— by getting the ball to O'Neal, al
though he didn't see it much early
on. ()'Neal had just two shots in the
first quarter — nine fewer than
Bryant — and three rebounds.
O'Neal resumed his dominance
in the second half, however, and the
Blazers — without suspended Dale
Davis and Stacey Augmon —
couldn't handle lum.
