(UNCI NN ATI (AP) â€” Ken Griffey Jr., who has
been unable to do anything hut pinch hit because
of a hamstring injurv, was plat ed on the 15-dav
disabled list yesterday.
The (lincinnati Reds said (iriffev "tweaked' his
left hamstring during a pint h-hitting appearance
in a 9-4 victory over the Rockies in Colorado on
Saturdav, prompting the move.
(iriffev partiallv tore the hamstring a week he
fore opening day, but resisted going on the dis
abled list. He has gone O-for-12 as a pinch hitter
with three walks and was hit by <i pitch. Whenever
he reached base the Reds would use .i pinch run
ner for him.
"He didn't re-tear the hamstring." Dr. I uno

thv Kremchek said. "It stared us enough. We
were luckv he didn't really aggravated it. Whv
take a chance at tlii> point? We tried something, it
didn't work."
I lie Reds didn't immediately fill Griffey's ros
ter spot, leaving it open for Deion Sanders. The
outfielder is eligible to join the club on Tuesday,
when it opens a series against the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
Late yesterday, the Reds also optioned right
hander Matt Skrmetta to Louisville, keeping his
roster spot open as well. Skrmetta was called up
over the weekend and didn't get into a game.
Sanders, 33, has not plaved in the majors since
1997, when he quit baseball to concentrate on pIay

ing cornerl).u k for the Dallas Cowbovs full-time.
Given a chance to join the Reds last season, he
chose instead to plav for the Washington Redskins.
Sanders extended his hitting streak to 13
games with an infield single Sunday .is Triple-A
Louisville lost to Columbus 6-2. Sanders is hitting
.459.
(iriffev hurt his left hamstring while rounding
third base in a spring training game on March 26,
and didn't have an MRI.
When lus hamstring was slow to heal, the Reds
ortlered an MRI on April 17, and it found a par
tial tear in the lowet part of the muscle. Griffey
tore the upper part of the same hamstring last
September.
