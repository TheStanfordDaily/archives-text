As the academic school vear draws to a
close, students are anticipating housing
plans tor next vear. Because <>l the current
housing crunch, mam graduate students
must he concerned not only with where the\
can live, hut also with it thev will he guaran
teed on-campus or off-campus housing in
the first place.
lo that end, the I niversitv has taken
extra measures to ensure that it can accom
modate as manv graduate students as possi
ble.
According to an e-mail from Maria Josue,
suhsidi/ecl housing program supervisor .it
Comnumit\ Housing Services, Stanford has
recently implemented several new policies
and procedures in the graduate student
Draw to retnech this situation.
I he list of on-campus housing assign
ments that a student can refuse while Mill
being eligible for off-campus I niversitv
housing has been expanded, for example, to
now include brothers Hall and Crothers
Memorial Hall double rooms, Kscondido

Village 1-bedroom double-occupancy apart
ments and Kscondido Village 2-bedroom
triple-oc ( upanc \ apartments.
|osuc s.iid that this new polic v comes with
one stipulation: " I Ins is only true, however,
101 students who are assigned to these loca
tions if they indicated that tliev are willing to
live anvwhere on campus, and not for stu
dents who listed them as a housing choice."
For those students who will not even be
provided with off-campus housing, a new
housing stipend program has been estab
lished. This program, which will be funded
by the President's Office, will provide $275
per month for up to '<()() single- students and
couples w ho are not assigned any housing. A
lottery will be held during the summer
months to select students.
Kong Pan, a master's student in the De
partment of Flectrical Fngineering who did
not get I niversitv housing said, "1 think that
I niversity subsidizing is great .... Renting
111 Silicon \ alley is very expensive, especially
for graduate students."
"A lot of people cannot afford a car either,
which makes it even more inconvenient to
live off campus because the area does not

have good public transportation," Pan said.
Despite this burden on students, the Uni
versity's land use plans prevent development
within the existing limits of campus. As a re
sult, the administration must continue to
work on expanding oil-cam pus subsidized
housing. Ac cording to Josue, leases on over
100 new bed spaces have been secured,
which means that over SOO graduate stu
dents can be housed through this program.
In the event that demand rises, Stanford
may be able to rent 50 more spaces.
Pan also said that most on-campus gradu
ate housing, such as the Rains Houses, con
sists solely of one- or two-story buildings. "I
think they c an convert a lot of buildings to
high rises," she said.
I iopeless as the on-campus housing situa
tion may seem, it has not posed a problem for
all students.
Peter Westen, a cotet initial student in the
Computer Science Department said, "1 did
draw very poorly, but 1 was able to walk in
and have been living in Rains all year."
He explained that the walk-on program
