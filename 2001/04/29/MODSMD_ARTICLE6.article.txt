## 
### JEFFREY TAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
-1 lie Libertarians are coming.
Junior Klliot Berkinan has started
an on-campus student group, the
Stanford Libertarians, to pro
mote the cause of the Libertarian
Party. The Libertarian Party will
become the fourth national party
represented at Stanford, joining
the (Ireen, Democratic and Re
publican parties.
" The [Libertarian] philosophy
is founded on the principles of a
truly free market economy,"
Berkinan said. "There's a huge
emphasis on civil liberties, ab
solute right to freedom, property
and speech. Most of the party
platform is derived from these
things. For example . . . signifi
cantly lower taxes."
The group was officially regis
tered .it the end of last quarter,
and the first meeting will oc cur in

a few weeks. According to Berk
man, the president of the new
group, so far approximately 50
students have expressed interest
by responding to an information
al e-mail that was sent to cam
puswide lists.
"T he overwhelming response
[from students] we've had so far is
partly explained by the lack of po
litical representation this end of
the political spec trum," Berkinan
said. "I think this campus is sort of
divided, polarized towards the
Democratic Party. Libertarians
are different from the two-party
systems. Democrats and Republi
cans are basically the same."
According to Berkinan. the
group will be involved in a variety
of activities. He said he was hop
ing the group would move to
wards political ac tivism, but that,
before that happens, it might first
have to educate the Stanford
community about who the Liber

tarians arc and what they be
lieve in.
Herkman said that the group
would achieve this by inviting
Libertarian speakers to Stanford
for political lectures and discus
sion. He added that there are al
ready a number of Libertarian
leaning professors on campus
who could serve in this role, no
tably in the philosophy, econom
ics .nid computer science
departments and at the
Hoover Institution.
Junior Bob McCJrew, former
editor of The Stanford Review,
was one of the people who read
and responded to the Libertarian
informational e-mail.
"It's going to be interesting to
see what they do," he said. "1
hope they'll do more [political]
philosophy rather than political
events. It'll be nice if tlicv could
(lunge the politic;tl atmosphere
on campus, but, somehow, I
don i see that happening. I here
;aie] too tew libertarians and too
main liberals."
McC.rew said, though, that he
was not surprised that so manv
people responded to the infor
mational e-mail.
