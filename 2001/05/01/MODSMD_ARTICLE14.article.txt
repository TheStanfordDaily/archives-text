### JENNIFER McGRADY 
A ('.alifornia man who last vear pled guiltv to liac k
ing into hundreds of computers, including some at
NASA and Stanford, lias been arrested on suspic ion
of using stolen credit card numbers to wire monc\.
According to a Los Angeles limes report carlici
this month, the FBI apprehended Jason hickman of
Mission Yiejo after he allegedlx tried tluec times
unsuccessfully — to make fraudulent wire transfers
through Western I Hion.
At the time, Diekman was awaiting sentenc ing on
federal c harges resulting from incidents last veai in
w I lie Ii he hacked into computer s\ stems at N ASA, .is
well as at Stanford and other universities, using the
me knaine "Shadow Knight."
Stanlord officials said the- I nivei sit\ lias no role in
the- FBl'sc urrent investigation of Diekman, as there is
no indication that lie ac cessed credit c ard inlot ination
on Stanlord computers.
"We had some systems that were broken into. We

11 at ke-d it hack, kept an eye on it, and tm tied it ovei
to the- FBI foi further investigation," said (Computer
Sec uritN Oflicer Stephen Hanson, referring to last
\ e.us attacks.
\c c ording to I latison, hac ket s rout inch attempt to
gain access to the Stanford computet network, but
Diekman s case w as "unusualh slopp\."
()bviousl\. we were able to gather a lot of informa
tion about him. so lie- wasn't ver\ good," I lanson said.
It is usualh tunc Ii harder to tr.u k the origin of an
attai k. lie- added.
Lots of lolks we see tight now are coming from
o\e-i seas, and that's very difficult," I lanson said. "It's
dillic uli to move lot ward with an investigation to the
ultimate point o! prosecution without the coopera
tion of an agency such as the FBI because local au
thorities siinph don't have the resources to track
these people."
Stanford Polite- Lieutenant Del Band\ agreed that
hackers' efforts to cover their
tracks are aided In the global na
ture of the Internet.
"Usually, it's not just one loca
tion that they're hac king," lie said.
"They're hitting hundreds across
the country, so the FBI lias to han
dle the investigation."
Although Hickman's network
intrusion was serious enough to
merit referral to the FBI, Hanson
said it was not the worst case in
terms of impacting students.
"If somebody wanted to be real
ly nasty — and people have in the
past — they could do an identity
theft," he said, citing an incident in
which a student's e-mail account
was used to send a racist message
to hundreds of recipients.
"In another case, a graduate
student had six months' worth of
research erased," I lanson said.
Hanson urged all students and

staff to "be careful about secure
use of the system."
In particular, lie warned about
the risks of downloading informa
tion from unsafe Web sites and
urged computer users to create
backup copies of any data stored
on the network.
"If you're trusting someone else
to do backups lor you, have you
taken the time to find out how se
cure .ind effective that backup is?"
he asked.
Ft. Bandy praised the efforts
of the Computer Security Office
to combat risks to the network.
I liey're really very good over
there about protecting student
and stall accounts," he said. "Peo
ple should feel comfortable that
Stanford is looking out for the se
curity of their network from
every angle."
