## The 						Stanford Daily Environmental cause merits University support 
### 
Published Since IS9I

Last wkek's founding of ihe
Stanford branch of Kyoto Now was an
important step in bringing about stu
dent awareness of international issues
faiing the environment. I lie group will spon
sor a teach-in on May 1 1, but now is the time
for the University to start thinking about its
role on this issue. I he University should be
prepared to acknowledge the group's efforts
and prepare a statement of support for the
treaty in order to send a positive message
about Stanford's concern for the environment.
Kvoto Now is a national organization dedi
cated to the United States Senate ratification
of the Kvoto Protocol — an agreement signed
in 1997 by world leaders to reduce green
house gas emissions — and much of the
group's support has been found on college
campuses. 1 lie Stanford's group will lot us on
the campus's Cogen Facility, which produces

methane gas — a gas that does more environ
mental damage than carbon dioxide. Like it or
not, Stanford does indeed have a stake in the
welfare of the environment. And, .it a time
when the responsibility of the I niversity's en
vironmental practices is being questioned left
and right, it is important that the University
send a strong message of support. Further
more, ignoring the efforts of these students
would be unfair and irresponsible.
I he University has many political and scien
tific connections in government and
academia. Publicly supporting the treaty
could be a big step in getting it ratified. But
while the Stanford Kyoto Now members seem
optimistic'about the student support they can
build from now until the end of the year, I Di
versity support for the group has been dismal
so far. 1 lie group asked the I niversity to pro
duce an inventory of greenhouse gas emis

sions and has gotten little response. The Uni
versity has practically ignored the efforts of
other recent student protests, but this is one
on which a bit of advanced work can really
make a difference.
Cornell University's Kyoto Now group
staged a protest two weeks ago to encourage
the university to issue a statement that it
would try to comply with the principles of the
treaty. Stanford should support the Kyoto
heaty's mission to lower greenhouse emis
sions to provide solidarity on an academic
level. Students at Cornell are working with
the administration there to support the
treaty, and we should show our support of
their efforts.
The nation's top colleges also conduct im
portant government research and, to some
extent, have a role in shaping national poli
cies. If enough campuses support the treaty,

the Senate will have to listen, which is precise
ly why Stanford needs to step up and support
the treaty's measures.
In an academic year marked by controver
sy over development in the Foothills and con
cern about building the Carnegie Institution
in the Foothills, the University should take this
opportunity to send at least one positive con
servationist message. Furthermore, Universi
ty support for the Kyoto Treaty could poten
tially offset some of the negative messages that
have left many student and local environmen
talists upset. Supporting the Kyoto Treaty
would be one step in a positive direction.
The student support is certainly there, and
the University has a few weeks during which
to assess the treaty before taking action. Stu
dents are tired of speaking up to the Universi
ty and hearing nothing in return, so now is the
time for administrators to act.
