# DEEP IN LEFT FIELD
## Another look at Res Ed

In "The Tipping Point," author Mal
colm Oladwell says th.tt, when influ
ential people make the smallest of ad
justments in the way they approach a
problem, big changes can result. In New
York (litv in the earlv 19905, violent crime
on subways "tipped" down after the New
York (litv Transit Authority implemented a
strong anti-graffiti program. In «i Yale I 111-

up from to 2H percent after a map of the

cination brtx hure.
R.»t ial division at Stanford in a problem

that can "tip" for the bet
ter, too. And the ones who
can lead tli.it c hange are
resident assistants in
freshman dorms. The
problem, as I pointed out
last week ("The problem
with Res Kd," April L' l), is
that the Office of Resi
dential Kducation does

not prepare RAs to recognize and deal with
issues of rare.
All-trosh RAs are great people, and I am
honored to have worked with them .ill year
long as a freshman RAmvself. I liev are out
going. res|M)nsil)le, fun, energetic and reli
able,and they know how to handle just about
eventhing that conies up in a freshman
dorm. But when it comes to race, they cannot
easily recognize or adequately address the
uns|X)ken discomfort felt bv some students
that ( an build np and lead to the racial divi
sion I dcscnlx-d last week.
Ibis is probably because most all-frosh
RAs are White, and the ones who aren't
White, such as myself, are deemed "White"
by essentialist standards — we don't associ
ate strongly with our respective ethnic com
munities at Stanford (April < olumn, "Ises
sentialism dead? "). (Complicating this even
further,the number of all-trosh RAsotcolor
is far below parity with the undergraduate
population. (hit of ;i. r > current all-frosh RAs,
66 percent are White, 20 |xrc ent are Asian,
(i percent are Black, 6 percent are of mixed
race and none are Litino. (These are my
own statistics, based on what 1 know of this
year's all-frosh RAs).
The upshot of all this is th.it, as an aggre
gate, all-frosh RAs — often the greatest peer
influence in the lives of Stanford
freshmen — lack two things: the perspec
tive we need to con tied with the freshmen of
colors who have difficulty relating to the
dorm and the exjx'rience to convey, to all
residents, a true understanding of what it
means to live in a diverse community.
So is the solution to train RAs on how to
deal with race? Nope. Ili.it would lx> like try

ing to "train" someone who had nevei
worked with a team, handled paperwork or
listened to auothei jxtsou s problems to do
any of that Ix-foie Ixvoming an RA. It's jiist
completely unfeasible. We need more stu
dents of color, particularly Black and latino
students, to apply to! x* KAs in all-frosh dc inns.
In tins year's RA application process,
which culminates in RA selection on lliurs
day, t!ie numlx'i of minority applicants ex
pressing interest in all-frosh houses was ven
low, and it got even l< >wer after tw<> rounds of
applit ant review. Ibis isn't tos.i\ that students
of'color aren't qualified for the |< >b; its a num-
Ixtsissue. II lenuml x.t of Black 01 1 .itmoap

students of color who applv to he RAs apph

most often, ethnic theme dorms. Why don't
they applv tobeall-frosh RAs? Bee ause we're
stuck in a cycle: Due in part to the inability of
the staff to connect with them, main fresh
men of colot living in all-frosh dorms don't
want to be all-frosh RAs. Thus, incoming stu
dents of color who live in all-frosh dorms face
the same situation, year after year.
I his is a call to students of coloi who have
what il takes to applv next spring tor all
frosh RA positions. Though Res Ed would
do well to encourage more of you to applv
for the job, it will require nine h more than
an administrative effort to change the num
bers. You are the leaders who must take ac -
tion because it is you, not administrators,
who can "tip" race relations .it Stanford.
('.hanging the makeup of the residential
staff in all-frosh clonus c an "tip" the nature of
cross-cultural interactions that take place
during freshman year. Over time, this can
lead toan entirely new c ampus environment.
I lie freshmen who live in dorms with a more
diverse staff will lx- more open to disc ussing
the problems we face as a community and less
likely to segregate residentiallv.
Three years later, we will have an entire
undergraduate population th.it believes
wholeheartedly in Res Kd's mission state
ment. When that day comes, we will no
longer need to encourage students of color
to apply for all-frosh RA positions because
they will apply without our encouragement.
Increasing the number of all-frosh RAs
of color is not a cure-all; it's a tipping point.

that can "tip" for the bet

can lead tli.it c hange are
resident assistants in
freshman dorms. The
problem, as I pointed out
last week ("The problem
with Res Kd," April L' l), is
that the Office of Resi
dential Kducation does

not prepare RAs to recognize and deal with
issues of rare.
All-trosh RAs are great people, and I am
honored to have worked with them .ill year

going. res|M)nsil)le, fun, energetic and reli
able,and they know how to handle just about
eventhing that conies up in a freshman
dorm. But when it comes to race, they cannot
easily recognize or adequately address the
uns|X)ken discomfort felt bv some students
that ( an build np and lead to the racial divi
sion I dcscnlx-d last week.
Ibis is probably because most all-frosh
RAs are White, and the ones who aren't
White, such as myself, are deemed "White"
by essentialist standards — we don't associ
ate strongly with our respective ethnic com
munities at Stanford (April < olumn, "Ises
sentialism dead? "). (Complicating this even
further,the number of all-trosh RAsotcolor
is far below parity with the undergraduate
population. (hit of ;i. r > current all-frosh RAs,
66 percent are White, 20 |xrc ent are Asian,
(i percent are Black, 6 percent are of mixed
race and none are Litino. (These are my
own statistics, based on what 1 know of this
year's all-frosh RAs).
The upshot of all this is th.it, as an aggre
gate, all-frosh RAs — often the greatest peer
influence in the lives of Stanford
freshmen — lack two things: the perspec
tive we need to con tied with the freshmen of
colors who have difficulty relating to the
dorm and the exjx'rience to convey, to all
residents, a true understanding of what it
means to live in a diverse community.
So is the solution to train RAs on how to
deal with race? Nope. Ili.it would lx> like try

ing to "train" someone who had nevei
worked with a team, handled paperwork or
listened to auothei jxtsou s problems to do
any of that Ix-foie Ixvoming an RA. It's jiist
completely unfeasible. We need more stu
dents of color, particularly Black and latino
students, to apply to! x* KAs in all-frosh dc inns.
In tins year's RA application process,
which culminates in RA selection on lliurs
day, t!ie numlx'i of minority applicants ex
pressing interest in all-frosh houses was ven
low, and it got even l< >wer after tw<> rounds of

men of colot living in all-frosh dorms don't
want to be all-frosh RAs. Thus, incoming stu

the same situation, year after year.
I his is a call to students of coloi who have

do well to encourage more of you to applv

they will apply without our encouragement.
Increasing the number of all-frosh RAs

In "The Tipping Point," author Mal
colm Oladwell says th.tt, when influ
ential people make the smallest of ad
justments in the way they approach a
problem, big changes can result. In New
York (litv in the earlv 19905, violent crime
on subways "tipped" down after the New
York (litv Transit Authority implemented a
strong anti-graffiti program. In «i Yale I 111-
versity experiment, the percentage of stu
dents getting a tetanus vat < ination "tipped"
up from to 2H percent after a map of the
student health center was added to ilu- vac
cination brtx hure.
