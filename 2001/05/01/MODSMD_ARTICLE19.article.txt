Administration has 'dead' attitude
William |ames chaws a distinction lx'-
tween keeping 0111 hypotheses about the
world living 01 dead. To approach the be
liefs ol another with a live hypothesis is to
leave open the possibility th.it their view
holds, at the ven least, a fragment of truth.
I"o treat another's hvpothesis as dead is to
dose ofl any possibility of reconciling that
belief or finding truth within it.
After attending the April 2(> forum.
"What principles should govern the rela
tionship between Stanford Athletics and
corporate sponsors?" 1 felt compelled to
share what I observed to be a dead attitude
ol the administration toward concerned
students and professors. Whether or not
vou believe that there are serious ethical
concerns underlying Stanford's involve
ment with companies like Nike. Thursday
night's discussion illustrated the frighten
ing juxtaposition of concerned Stanford
community members and a close-minded
administration.
Provost John Ktchemendy seemed the
most unwilling to ac knowledge any inkling
of credibility in those who argued against
Stanford's current contract. Though pro
fessors Rush Kehin and David Abernethy
raised compelling questions, Ktchemendy
closed ofl any possibility of reconciling these
concerns with the economic interests of the
administration — leaving their ethical hy
potheses dead.
As a student in philosophy, 1 found it dis
illusioning to see a philosopher such as
Ktc hemendv c tinging to the pragmatic con
cerns ol the. iclministration. Articulating the
arguments behind the current contract is an
important part of this debate, but when

these arguments are presented, as they
were by Etc hemendy, as the only way things
could Ik- and as more intimately connected
to the truth, they turn into ideology.
We are surrounded by a world that has
left dead the hypotheses that fair wages
are a more ethical way of engaging in in
ternational trade than sweatshop labor.
Yet I hope that, as an academic institu
tion, our administration might do more
than blindly follow the inertia of corpo
rate America. The administration ought
to engage the Stanford community in
such a way that all voices are not only spo
ken, but listened to.
I urge Etchemendv and the others who
will make this decision to look beyond eco
nomic concerns that have circumscribed
their position — to find something alive in
a hypothesis that values our institutional
integrity over Stanford's corporate ties. We
put on the Stanford Lively Arts, the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop and myriad other
productions without using sponsorship
that involves individual students as a plat
form for advertisement. Why should ath
letics be any different?

Stanford should 'just do W
l-ct's keep the Nike 10g0... since it's
tree, it can replace the Tree. Ix't's make our
campus corporate headquarters for
Nike ... we can call it "Nike-Stanford." The
Department of Athletics can showcase
"Nike-Stanford" products. The Graduate
School of Business can handle corporate ti

nance, and the Alumni Ass<x iation can plan
Nike's special events and promotions.
With Nike's "just do it" attitude, the con
version from Stanford University to Nike-
Stanford will be easy!
"Just do it." (()r, did we already do it?)

Stanford has 'selfishly used
the Carnegie Foundation'
Both Carnegie and Stanford know that
their construction plans for the Foothills are
still out of line and out of bounds.
Carnegie has failed to make more than
minimal design changes in its "new" pro
posal for this high-density urban develop
ment. It's still too big, t<x) tall and t<x> wide.
No permanent easement for the tiger sala
mander. No seriously considered alterna
tive sites.
Stanford has selfishly used the Carnegie
Foundation in an attempt to sidestep /.oil
ing laws. I hey want to set a development
precedent in the Foothills by pushing a
21,000-square-foot building where it
doesn't lielong.
Proponents of this oversized plan are
wrong when they try to say it's all about ed
ucation. rhis is a land use issue.
Santa ( lat a County Supervisor Liz kniss
has been conscientious and well informed
during this entire process. She and her fel
low Santa County Clara supervisors can
continue to follow the laws of the land by re
jecting this flawed plan.
