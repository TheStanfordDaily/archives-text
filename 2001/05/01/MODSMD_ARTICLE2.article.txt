I Ik- Palo Alto Square I heater. Icxated
at the intersection of Kl ('.amino Real and
Page Mill Road, is scheduled to close in
mid-June. Kquitv (>lli< e Properties, whit h
owns the land, has served the theater with
a 90-dav cvit lion notice.
I he theater spec ializes in foreign and
art films. It is operated by landmark I he
atres, whit h .ilso runs the Park, the (iuild,
.md the Aquarius theaters in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park.
I he theater has not had a long-term
lease since 199f>, when its landlord at
tempted to (lose it. liec ause of the result
ing protest front < ivic leaders and other
community members, however, the the
ater was allowed to remain open. Since
then, it has been operatingon a month-to
month lease.
Manx members of the Palo Alto com
munity are again protesting the pending
closure of the theater. According to a Web
site called savethesquare.com, which is
dedicated to saving the theater, "If the

Palo Alto Square I 'heat re closes, the abil
ity for | Palo Alto] to become the ( ultural
meeting point for the Peninsula d\\ indies
. . . [Palo Alto] becomes a good place to
eat, but not much else."
I'hc Web site asserts that closing the
theater will reduce the variet\ of movies
plaving in Palo Alto. Because the theatei
generalK plavs the most popular art films,
the other Landmark theaters aie free to
play less well-known films.
Supporters argue that the loss <>1 the
Palo Alto Square l'heatre would limit the
selection of films at Landmark theatei s,
and therefore the overall selection of films
in Palo Alto.
"Asa result, art / foreign / independent
movie patrons inav have to travel to San
|ose or San Franc isco to be able to see the
films they currcntlv enjoy in Palo Alto
|and] Menlo Park," the Web site states.
Several Stanford students have also
expressed unhappincss ovei the the
ater's evic lion.
"It's a great theater to see indie
movies, ' freshman Jane Vavnnian s.iid.
"ft plays some of the best movies in the
Peninsula. It's a cool place and a great the
ater for people who care about seeing
good movies."
"It's reallv unfortunate because it plavs
a lot of good independent films," said
freshman Albert ('.lien. "Plus, it's an inti

mate setting, s»> it's a tool plac etogo if vou
don't want to deal with crowds."
