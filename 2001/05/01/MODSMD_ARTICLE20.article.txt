### 
HOLLYWOOD (AF) — With less than
two days left in the Hollywood writers con
tract, negotiators resumed talks yesterday,
hoping to avert a walkout tli.it would halt
TV and movie production.
Representatives ol the Writers (iuild of
America and the Alliance of Motion Pit ture
and Television Producers met throughout
the weekend, hut ended talks Sunday with
out bridging .1 $100 million gap between
their respective demands.
With both sides participating iu a news
blackout, it was unclear whether they had
made any progress over the weekend or
when talks started up again yesterday morn
ing. The current contract expires at mid
night tonight, and if talks break off, a strike
authorization vote and a walkout could take
place within a few days.
l he real cliffhanger tor audiences is
whether a strike will keep their favorite
comedies and dramas off the air in the fall.
If the writers walk out, the first victims
would be daily soap operas and late-night
variety shows, followed by sitcoms and houi -
long dramas if a strike drags on.
"It might be the wintci season before the
public starts seeing .1 lot of new shows," said
Doug Lieblcin, a writer-producer on the
CBS comedy "Yes, Dear."
Studio officials and WCJA leaders have
said they ate willing to compromise — but
only a little.
"The notion, which has been offered by
some, that the gap between us can possibly
be bridged by simply meeting in the middle
is ill-informed .tntl, unfortunately, .1 non
starter for us." Dream Works SK(» studio

head Jeffrey Kat/enberg said.
Walkout fears have strained Hollywood
for months, with studios preparing fora
dead zone in production by rushing film
shoots and trying, mostly in vain, to stock
pile scripts.
Not only is today the last day of the writ
ers union's contract for its I 1,0()() members,
but agreements for the two performers'
unions — the Screen Actors (Juiltl and the
American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists — expire on June MO.

I V networks say they may rely on more
reality programming to make up fora la< k
of scripted shows, but writers dismiss that
plan.
"Imagine if the netwot ks' Monti.i\ lineup
was essentially 'Survivor,' 'Millionaire' and
'Weakest Link,'and then on Fuesday,'Sur
vivor,' 'Millionaire' and 'Weakest Link,"
Lieblcin saitl. "The networks mav pretend
that won't kill them, but it will."
