draft treaty to be discussed .it the weeklong
meeting was weakei than expected. 1 hey
voiced fears that it might be watered down
still further, inc.hiding In President George
W. Hush, wlit> critics perceive as having links
to tobacco fii ins.
" The tobacco convention is in danger of
serious and irreversible failure," said (Hive
Bates, director of Action on Smoking and
I lealth.
However, World Health Organization
Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland
said the Wl l( )-sponsored treaty — which is
meant to enter into force by 2003 — was
proceeding ac cording to plan.
"Beyond the concern and the rhetoric,
beyond the anger and the anguish, it is our
ability to sec lire a set ol global rules to con
trol tobacco that will bear testimony to our
conviction," Brundtland told the opening
session.
The text under disc ussion was drawn up
by (lelso Amen im, a Brazilian diplomat who
chaired last ()c tober's first round of talks.
It would commit governments to ban "all
forms of direct and indirect tobacco adver

tising, promotion and sponsorship targeted
at persons under the age of 18," and to se
verely curb other advertising, including
sports promotion.

Anionm said he stopped shot to! propos
ing a total ban in recognition of "constitu

States and Bi az.il.
"I don't agree it's a weak text," he told a
press conference. "We have to have two
things: a convention that is meaningful
and one that is — at least in ptinciple
ratifiable."
1 lie di aft text also contains provisions to
combat smuggling, phase out dutv free
sales, increase taxes and control labels like
"low tar" or "mild," which are < l itic ized for
giving smokers a false sense of comfort.
But it also indicates that trade agree

Amoiim said he was confident that the
combined measures would have a real im

because of the surging toll in developing
