## Gosling halts losing run 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Every week, Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess reiterates a self-evident
truth: "No matter who we play, it we
don't play well, we're not going to win."
I his weekend, lit- w;i> right. Califor
nia — tht- same squad that hadn't won a
series from Stanford since 1993 — blind
sided and upset the then-No. 3 Cardinal
in 2-of-3 contests over the weekend at
Berkeley's Evans Diamond.
Stanford (34-12, 12-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference), now ranked No. 7 in the Base
hall America poll, failed to capture its
13th consecutive series win over the
Colden Bears and dropped into second
place in the Pac-10, one game behind
No. 5 Southern California.
file Bears (20-22, 11-10) came into
their penultimate conference series with

nothing to lose against the Cardinal,
which had resided atop the league
standings all season long. I he\ stifled
Stanford for two davs until the (Cardinal
finally broke through on Sunday to
avoid the series sweep.
Junior Mike Cosling provided a stel
lar outing on the hill on Sundav, throw
ing his first career shutout and striking
out 10 to give Stanford the win, 8-0.
Gosling retired IS of the last 20 he fated
and extended his scoreless-innings
pitched streak to 15, dating back to last
weekend against the Trojans.
"Mike Gosling has given us a great
pitching performance two weeks in a r< >w
when we've needed it," Marquess said.
"Cal handled us pretty well in the first
two games of this series, but today
Gosling pitched a superb game and we
got some key hits."
Through six innings on Sunday, the

Bay Area rivals were locked in a pitchers'
duel with Stanford ahead, 1-0. However,
tlu- (Cardinal pushed six runs across with
two outs in the top of the seventh to sal
vage the season s final game between the
two teams.
Freshman Sam l uld singled up the
middle with two outs to score two runs
and make it a H-0 contest. Then Stanford
released its frustration from the scries'
previous two games. Junior Chris O'Ri
ordan and sophomores Ryan (>arko and
|ason Cooper followed with RHI hits to
put the (Cardinal well ahead.
"We needed this game," Costing
said, alter allowing California just four
hits on Sunday. "It was great when we
put np that six-run inning, hnt I still
wanted to go out there and pitch like it
was a 1 -0 game."
