# Despite upsets, men swing to championship
## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Dominance has been a theme for the top-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team this season, and it certain
ly showed at the I'acifu 10 Conference Individual
C Championships, held over the past weekend in ()jai.
Stanford (21-1, 7-0 I'ac-10), which sent eight play
ers to the championships, barely missed completing
the four-event sweep when 21st-ranked junior K.J.
Hippensteel (26-6 in the regular season) lost in the
singles finals of the I'ac-10 division to the surging
play of Southern California's 77th-ranked Ryan
Moore, 6-3, 6-2.
The loss broke the Cardinal's five-year stranglehold
on the I'ac-10 Singles Championship.
"Ryan [Moore] was too good in the finals," Hippen
steel said. "He is playing with lots of confidence right
now, and that made him tough to beat. 1 had opportu
nities to break and put myself in the lead early on, and
1 didn't capitalize."
Stanoftl head coach Dick Gould was also impressed.
"Ryan played great and deserved to win the tour
ney," Gould said. "Both [K.J.] and Alex got steam
rolled by a red-hot Rvan."
However, Hippensteel and senior teammate Alex
Kim, the lOth-ranked doubles team in the nation with
a record of 14-5, muscled their way through the Pac-10
doubles draw and became the I'ac-10 Doubles Cham
pions by defeating Olivier Charroin and Pim \ an Mele
of Arizona State in convincing fashion, 6-1, 6-1. After a
rocky 4-3 start to the season, Kim and Hippensteel
have won 14 of their last 16 matches.
"After struggling in the doubles tourney [by losing
in the first round] for the past two years, it felt really
good to win," Hippensteel said.
. In recognition of the outstanding performance by
the Stanford players who competed in the Pac-10 di
vision, the championships presented the Cardinal
with the Thacher Cup, given to the team that com
piles the most wins in the Pac-10 division. UCLA fin
ished second.
The Cardinal players were even more dominant in
