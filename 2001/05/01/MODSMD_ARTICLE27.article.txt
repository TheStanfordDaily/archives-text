### BRIAN DECKER 
Leaving its dominating top
four players to rest at home last
weekend, tlit* No. 1 Cardinal
women's tennis team (24-0) re
ceived the expected results after
sending only four players to ()jai
for the Pacific 10 Conference In
dividual Championship.
Freshmen Lauren Barnikow
and Lmilia Anderson and senior
Sarah Pestieau competed in the
main draw, while freshman Lizzy
Bennett represented Stanford in
the invitational division. Al
though none of the women
reached the singles quarterfinals,
Emilia Anderson and Lizzy Ben
nett made it to the second round
of their respective divisions.
In Thursday's first-round ac -
tion, Anderson defeated Wash
ington's llona Kordonskaya, 7-5,
0-4. Stanford's other two first
round main draw matches were
losses to a pair of Bruins.
Pestieau was eliminated by
UCLA's lOth-ranked Sara Walk
er, 0-0. 0-3, while Walker's team
mate Lauren Fisher edged
Barnikow, 7-0, 0-3.
Anderson advanced to the sec -
ond round, but No. 54 Christina
Fusano of California ousted her,
0-4, 7-0.
In the invitational division,
made up of each team's bottom
four players, Bennett trounced
UCLA's Michelle Steifel, 0-2, 0-
2, to advance to the second
round, before losing to South

ern California's Bern adit te
Bayani, 0-0, 7-0.
The difficulties Stanford met
with at ()jai can be completely at
tributed to the absence of the top
half of the team. Sophomore
Laura Granville, the- nation's
top-ranked player, and juniors
Lauren Kalvaria, ranked 1 ltli.
Gabby Lastra, ranked 22nd, and
Keiko Tokuda, ranked 40th,
opted to stay home because of
scheduling conflicts. So, forced
to take on the other teams' best
players, the Stanford women
who went to ()jai played some of
their most difficult matches of
the year.
No. 8 Adria Lngel of Arizona
State won the Pac-10 Individual
Championship and gained the
conference singles title Sundav,
defeating Cal's Racjuel Kops-
Jones, ranked 01st, in straight
sets, 7-5, 0-2.
The Pac-10 Individual Cham
pionship marked the opening of
the postseason and the List
chance Stanford had .it match
play before the NCAA I cam
Championships begin May 11.
The undefeated Cardinal is fa
vored to win the title one year
after falling to upset-minded
Georgia in the tournament final.
"Ojai was not an indication of
how we will perform at NCAAs,
but 1 think we all met some solid
competition that reaffirms |ust
how competitive the tournament
will be," Bennett said.
Despite the earlv exits, the
team said it views ()jai in an opti
mistic light.
"Everyone made a lot of
progress. Emilia had a good win in
