### BRIAN DECKER 
Leaving its dominating top
four players to rest at home last
weekend, tlit* No. 1 Cardinal
women's tennis team (24-0) re
ceived the expected results after
sending only four players to ()jai
for the Pacific 10 Conference In
dividual Championship.
Freshmen Lauren Barnikow
and Lmilia Anderson and senior
Sarah Pestieau competed in the
main draw, while freshman Lizzy
Bennett represented Stanford in
the invitational division. Al
though none of the women
reached the singles quarterfinals,
Emilia Anderson and Lizzy Ben
nett made it to the second round
of their respective divisions.
In Thursday's first-round ac -
tion, Anderson defeated Wash
ington's llona Kordonskaya, 7-5,
0-4. Stanford's other two first
round main draw matches were
losses to a pair of Bruins.

er, 0-0. 0-3, while Walker's team
mate Lauren Fisher edged
Barnikow, 7-0, 0-3.
Anderson advanced to the sec -
ond round, but No. 54 Christina
Fusano of California ousted her,
0-4, 7-0.
In the invitational division,
made up of each team's bottom
four players, Bennett trounced
UCLA's Michelle Steifel, 0-2, 0-
2, to advance to the second
round, before losing to South

ern California's Bern adit te
Bayani, 0-0, 7-0.
The difficulties Stanford met
with at ()jai can be completely at
tributed to the absence of the top
half of the team. Sophomore
Laura Granville, the- nation's
top-ranked player, and juniors
Lauren Kalvaria, ranked 1 ltli.
Gabby Lastra, ranked 22nd, and
Keiko Tokuda, ranked 40th,
opted to stay home because of
scheduling conflicts. So, forced
to take on the other teams' best
players, the Stanford women
who went to ()jai played some of
their most difficult matches of
the year.

competition that reaffirms |ust
how competitive the tournament
