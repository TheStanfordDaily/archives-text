# Rome's 'Jungle' evens the score

There is only one rule
in the "Jungle": Have
a take and don't suck.
Wth this simple con
dition, sports talk-radio host Jim
Rome has transformed the
once-calm landscape of sports
radio into a war /one.
l or some, Rome epitomizes
today's brash, in-your-face style
of plav with 110 regard for tradi
tion and etiquette.

sive .ind edgy takes — sutli as

But one tiling is certain:
Rome is the most popular sports
talk-show host ever. Period.
After starting on the "Scrub
Saturday" talk show at a San
Diego affiliate, Rome lias con
tinued to "blow up" aiul is now
syndicated nationally by Pre
mier netwoi ks.
For some, Rome is best
known for bis infamous inci
dent with former NELquarter
back |im Everett. During a live
interview on ESPN2, Kverett
attacked Rome after the talk
show host repeatedly referred
to him as "dims," an obvious
reference to women's tennis
legend Chris Evert and the
quarterback's alleged lear of
staving in the pocket.

But what people do not im
mediately appreciate is Rome's
work habit. He prepares and
researches for his shows as if
each show is going to be his
last. Perhaps it is because he
works himself to the point of
having ulcers that Rome sim
ply cannot be imitated, no mat
ter how many clones show up
on the local airwaves.
Combining fresh takes and
ideas with his great rapport
among professional athletes, the
"|ungle" is a unique radio at
mosphere where athletes some
times randomly call the show for
some "Jungle karma." a belief
that being interviewed in the
"Jungle" will help the athlete in
his upcoming games.
As a testament to his massive
following, Rome can confidently
tell people not to call Ins talk
shows, unlike other boring talk
show scrubs who beg people to
call in. Rome wants a great
product, and that includes great
callers with a lot of smack. When
someone actually does call with
a take that tliev cannot justify or
with nothing to say, Rome has a
zero-tolerance policy, saving the
listeners from unbearably stu
pid sports fans.
Here is a sample of some of
the "Jungle gloss" — derived
from the word "glossary" but
meaning unique "Jungle"
speak — that has made the (tin
gle so unique.
