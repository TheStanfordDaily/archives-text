Many students at Stanford must fine
problems of eating disorders and poor
body image every day.

munity Health Specialist Donovan
Soinera israel acknowledges the seri
ousness of this problem based on bis own
experience.
" The cleaning stafV is always having to
unplug its toilets because there is so
much vomit," Yisrael said. "RAs have
had this problem to the extent that they
have to take a leave. If you just look

around campus .it the amount of exer
cise that goes on, everyone is running.
Though you wouldn't think it, exercise is
a form of purging."
Yisrael said eating disorders are as se
rious an issue as alcohol abuse.
"At Stanford, people want to be per
fect. The more perfectionism, the more
tendency toward eating disorders," he
said. "Alcohol is .1 big issue because people
die from its effects, and, with eating disor
ders, people don't die. I lowever ... most
of the population It.is thought about it at
one time 01 another."
According to freshman Lisa Mendel
man, founder of the Disordered Eating

Kdu< ation .iikl Prevention ('onin il. there
is <1 difference between body issues
at Stanford and at other schools because
of the type of students at the University.
"Stanford is looking for people with
great academic accomplishments and
aehievements," Mendelman said. " Those
types of people have a lot of'control and
self-discipline, which, when combined
with .1 negative body image, < an lead to a
lot of detrimental behaviors."
Different organizations at Stanford ad
dress the problem of bodv image dissatis
faction. Dr. Naomi Brown, a clinical psy-
chologist at Cowell, leads the Body
linage (iroup, a six-week program
designed to confront cultural
nivths, educate students on bod\
intake issues and provide healing
for women's negative hod\ image.
I his group pro\ ides support in
a confidential setting and is led In
staff from (ounscling And I'svc h«>-
logical Services at Cowell.
I he Body Image (iroup has
been offered even quartet for the
past two vears. According to
Brown, the program was started to
meet the needs of students on cam
pus who were struggling with a
negative hodv image.
"fl he group hopes to| provide a
supportive environment where it is
safe lor people to share theii hodv
image concerns and to begin heal
ing [by| challenging erroneous as
sumptions about weight, beautv
and thinness," Brown said.
"Rather than fenusing on weight
loss, [students] leant mam wavs to
appreciate and accept one's bocl\
lot all that it can do."
Besides wot king toward emo
tional healing, the group also dis
cusses the bod\ s phvsical respcdisc
to unhealthy eating patterns.
According to Yisracl, body
image problems arise w hen people
d.image themselves while tr\ ing to
attain an ideal bod v. Blown said

the problem stems from the media
and commercials.
"[The factors] include expo
sure to unrealistic ally thin images
that are propagated In multibil
lion-dollar media industries,"
Brown said. "[Then,] the diet in
dustries feed ofl the fear and anx
iety induced in women and men
who cannot ac cept their bodies be
cause the\ don't look like the un
realistic all\ thin images portrayed
by media."
According to Brown, further
damage arises as the media tries to
associate thinness with happiness
and sue c ess. even though nocc>i re
lation exists between these fac tot s.
"In anv place sue h as Los .Ange
les, Florida and New York,where
the fashion industry dominates
and contributes to an atmosphere
of hod\ foe us, there will be a prob
lem with body image," Yisracl said.
According to Brown, the Bod\
Image (Iroup attempts to address
this problem through group and
individual therapy, where 1111-
hcaltln and unrealistic desired
body images are c hallenged, as is
the faulty association between thin
ness and happiness.
Mendcltnan agrees that poor
body image contributes to un
healthy eating patterns and disor
dered eating.
In response to her own experi
ence with personal eating disor
ders and the amount ot pco pie
suffering from disordered eating
and excess exercise, Mcndelnian

started the disordered eating
group last tall .
The goal of the group is to in
crease campus awareness ot disor
dered eatingand conned people to
resources, such as the Bridge.
According to Mendelman, dis
ordered eating is different from
eating disorders because disor
dered eating affects a lot more
people than full-blown eating dis
orders do.
"Disordered eating is equally
difficult to live with as eating dis
orders," Mendelman said. "Ii is
most dangerous tor people's men
tal health."
I lie group will distribute a flier
11 Kit will give information on disor
dered eating .is well as prompt stu
dents to become aware of their ow 11
body image.
Because she lias survived an
eating disorder. Mendelman lias.i
different view on bod\ image and
is often ama/.ed at the lack ot
knowledge at Stanford about
body image.
"There have been so inanv
times when I'm with a friend work
ing out or running and I hear a
comment about how great some
one- looks because the\'re so thin,"
Mendelman said. "But I don't
think they look great — tliev pist
look sic k.
