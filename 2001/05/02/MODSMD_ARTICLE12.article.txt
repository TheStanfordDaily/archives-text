1985
On May 2, 1985, I lie Daih printed .in article
about student elicits to get the I niversit\ to divest
its interests in South Africa.
"Following .i closed meeting vesterda\ with 1H
members of the Hoard ol 1 rustecs and I ni\ei sit\
President Donald Kennech. representatives ol Stan
lord Out of South Africa called the trustees 'open
minded'about divestment ol I iii\c i sit\ funds from
companies that do business in South Africa.
"Board President William Kimball char.i< teri/ed
the meeting .is 'a dialogue. ver\ useful, verv iiil« >rnia
tive, verv interesting, good questions, good ansuei v
"Although he has opposed divestment in the p.ist,
Kimball said he is 'open-minded regarding the
issue. 1 lowever, his open-niindedness is not an indi
cation that he is changing his position, he added."
Bottom line: F. W. de Klerk wasn't the only one who took a
while to change — Stanford did, too.
