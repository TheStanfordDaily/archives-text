1 lie policv, titled "A Protocol for Address

Community, is an internal document es
tablished three vears ago and jnsi recently
made public.
I here lease of this document comes at a
time when campuses across the country
are facing hate crime problems. Iwo
raciallv motivated hate crimes were rec ent

1 )nkr I niversitv c ausing students there to
demand a hate ( rime protocol.
Duke administrators have asked the
Student Affairs Division at Stanford lor a
copv of its protocol, according to Dean of
Students Marc Wais and Assistant Dean of
Students I oniniv Lee Woon.
"(Other schools] view our protocol as a
national model, and thev look to us tor
leadership, Wais said. "Some students
feel that Stanford lias been unresponsive
[to recent hate graffiti], but to a lot of
schools we re viewed as proactive and re

Nonetheless, few students have heard
of tliis 21 -page dot uinent bet ause, a< < end

Last Wednesday, the University re
leased the protocol to the public.
I lie document bases its polio on the
Fundamental Standard, .1 set of guidelines
for student behavior on campus. Specifi
cally, the standard states, "Students at
Stanford are expected to show both within
and without the I niversit\ such respect
for . . . the lights of others as is demanded
of good citizens."
However, the protocol notes that the
Fundamental Standard is "inadequate as .1
means for preventing or addressing the
impact of random and anon vinous acts of
intolerance." and it aims to address the
harmful effect that such events might
(ause in the communitv.
An ac 1 of intolerance is defined .is any
thing that harms a student "on the basis of
their sex. race, age, color, disability, eco
nomic bat kgi ound, religion, sexual 01 icn
talion, national .ind ethnic origin. A
"threat to community" is a harmful event
that "implicates a group's i<leniii\ and
background."
I he harmful events outlined in the pro
tocol range from minor to ver\ serious.
Acts of intolerance, ac cording to the proto
col. include hale crimes, blocking handi
cap entrances with bicycles and scream inn

I .ike Bat k the Night \l.ik h."
\\ais said that the protocol was de
signed to be a holistic. < oinprehensive doc -
uinent. "li s a starting point," Wais said.
"When 11 came oui three years ago, no one
else had one."
I he protocol defines seven guiding

communication, collective responsibility,
coinniuniiv caring and civic dialogue.
I lie do< uinent lias Imlt- 111101 mation 011
how and where to report harmful acts. In

fact, tlns part of the report was described as
"haphazard" b\ a student in reviewing the

Once reported, acts of intolerance are
assessed and the dean of students consults
with a Protocol Advisory 1 earn on how to
handle the matter. The Team assesses the
severity of the niattei. the threats associat

individual responses.
\ 111.1 jor lot us of the protocol is ( 0111111 u

that "a student communis that experi

lie more likel\ to have the learning envi

Nonetheless, rec eni student critic ism of
administration handling of the hate graffi
ti lias been about the lack of communica

two incidents — w 111< Ii occurred during fi

count for part of the- problem.
I he first incident of graffiti did not
occ 111 until altei I he Daily s the last winter

incidents followed before the first Dail\

ately. I nivcrsit) President John Hennessv
prompth sent out a letter to the campus
c onununitv. printed in The Dail\ the week
alter spring break and also sent a letter to

111 addition to calendar issues, a inajoi rea
son the I nivcrsih waited until April to re

Wais s.iid. "W'e were concerned people
might have been i at tied and upset | in such

Wais does admit that he erred in wait

that he should have sent the lettei seven to

In response to student reaction to the

Editors Note: This is the second in a series about
hate-crimes on campus. Look for next week's ar
ticle on student response to hale crimes and how
professors feel about the significance of this issue
on campus.
In response to the recent hate graffiti in
the I .ane 1 listory (lorner and other areas,
students have attacked the I niversitv's
handling of the crisis. ()ne poster placed in
undergraduate dormitories (laimcd, " I lie
I niversitv has no official enforceable poli
cy against hate crimes such as these."
I lowever, a closer inspec lion of I niver
sit\ policv reveals that Stanford does in
deed have a polic v todeal with hate crimes.
1 lie policv, titled "A Protocol for Address
ing Acts of Intolerance and I'll reals to
Community, is an internal document es
tablished three vears ago and jnsi recently
made public.
I here lease of this document comes at a
time when campuses across the country
are facing hate crime problems. Iwo
raciallv motivated hate crimes were rec ent
l\ committed against Asian Americans at
1 )nkr I niversitv c ausing students there to
demand a hate ( rime protocol.
Duke administrators have asked the
Student Affairs Division at Stanford lor a
copv of its protocol, according to Dean of
Students Marc Wais and Assistant Dean of
Students I oniniv Lee Woon.
"(Other schools] view our protocol as a
national model, and thev look to us tor
leadership, Wais said. "Some students
feel that Stanford lias been unresponsive
[to recent hate graffiti], but to a lot of
schools we re viewed as proactive and re
sponsive."

Nonetheless, few students have heard
of tliis 21 -page dot uinent bet ause, a< < end
ing to Woon. "it's been an in\ isihle hand of
support to the student bodv," coordinat
ing the actions of Student Allah s I )i\ ision
staff members.
Last Wednesday, the University re
leased the protocol to the public.
I lie document bases its polio on the
Fundamental Standard, .1 set of guidelines
for student behavior on campus. Specifi
cally, the standard states, "Students at
Stanford are expected to show both within
and without the I niversit\ such respect
for . . . the lights of others as is demanded
of good citizens."
However, the protocol notes that the
Fundamental Standard is "inadequate as .1
means for preventing or addressing the
impact of random and anon vinous acts of
intolerance." and it aims to address the
harmful effect that such events might
(ause in the communitv.
An ac 1 of intolerance is defined .is any
thing that harms a student "on the basis of
their sex. race, age, color, disability, eco
nomic bat kgi ound, religion, sexual 01 icn
talion, national .ind ethnic origin. A
"threat to community" is a harmful event
that "implicates a group's i<leniii\ and
background."
I he harmful events outlined in the pro
tocol range from minor to ver\ serious.
Acts of intolerance, ac cording to the proto
col. include hale crimes, blocking handi
cap entrances with bicycles and scream inn
I D
obscenities al people panic ipatiug in a
I .ike Bat k the Night \l.ik h."
\\ais said that the protocol was de
signed to be a holistic. < oinprehensive doc -
uinent. "li s a starting point," Wais said.
"When 11 came oui three years ago, no one
else had one."
I he protocol defines seven guiding
| >1 inciples: prevention, so uritv, education,
communication, collective responsibility,
coinniuniiv caring and civic dialogue.
I lie do< uinent lias Imlt- 111101 mation 011
how and where to report harmful acts. In

fact, tlns part of the report was described as
"haphazard" b\ a student in reviewing the
protocol.
\\ ais said that Ins office looks at each in
(ident on a case-by-case basis and dial stu
dents can report crimes 111 a variety of
\\a\s, including through the Residential
I.due at ion < Mice, the Dean < >112 Sludents( >f
fice or the ()flice of Religious I.ife.
Once reported, acts of intolerance are
assessed and the dean of students consults
with a Protocol Advisory 1 earn on how to
handle the matter. The Team assesses the
severity of the niattei. the threats associat
ed with it and necessary community and
individual responses.
\ 111.1 jor lot us of the protocol is ( 0111111 u
nication of I hiversitx response, noting
that "a student communis that experi
ences 1 he effectiveness of the Student Al
lans staff s response to threats to commu
nity and confirmed acts of intolerance w ill
lie more likel\ to have the learning envi
ronment ii needs."
Nonetheless, rec eni student critic ism of
administration handling of the hate graffi
ti lias been about the lack of communica
tion. Wais notes that the timing of the first
two incidents — w 111< Ii occurred during fi
nals and Dead Week last quarter — ac
count for part of the- problem.
I he first incident of graffiti did not
occ 111 until altei I he Daily s the last winter
cju.ll ter issue was published and two more
incidents followed before the first Dail\
issue in April, after spring hi eak. I his pub
lication schedule prevented the adminis
tration from informing students immedi
ately. I nivcrsit) President John Hennessv
prompth sent out a letter to the campus
c onununitv. printed in The Dail\ the week
alter spring break and also sent a letter to
lac 1111\ and stall.
111 addition to calendar issues, a inajoi rea
son the I nivcrsih waited until April to re
spond to the hate graffiti was fear of inter
-1 upting and upsetting students during linals.
\\ e had to ask: Does this serve the pull
in good in informing students of this as

the\ are preparing and taking finals,"
Wais s.iid. "W'e were concerned people
might have been i at tied and upset | in such
.1 manner .isJ to advci sel\ afle< t exam and
pa pet grades."
Wais does admit that he erred in wait
ing until April I 7 to send his own lettei to
I he l).ul\ regarding the incident, noting
that he should have sent the lettei seven to
10 da\ s earlier.
