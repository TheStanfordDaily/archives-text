Bui wliv is I he Daily running these
pieces now? In some extent, we felt left
out because we did not receive the ad
vei liseinent until long alter many other
college newspapers had. I hough we
could not be sure win we had not been

offered the advertisement, our best
guesses all led us to believe that, .11 le.isi in
the eyes of Horowit/. and his associates,
Stanford was not the kind of < ampus thai
would reait 111 am visible fashion — with
protests and sit-ins, as otliei campuses
hail — so it was not even worth n \ing to
provoke a response.
We, as a newspaper, believe 111 dia
logue, so we were liaturalh saddened l>\
the implication that Stanford's student
boilv was not perceived .is .1 group pas
sionate or informed enough to organize
around an issue so mam otliei college
students had deal l\ taken to Ilc.lll.
I bus, when we finalh did receive the
advertisement and, consei|iienih. began
thinking about the related questions
again, we saw an invaluable opportunity
to promote conversation, dispel some
myths about Stanford and, in the pin
cess, foster a greatei sense of < ommunitv.
