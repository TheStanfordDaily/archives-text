## Disability Draw easy to abuse

I usc<l to wish I had asthma. Sometimes
.ill I wanted was .111 allergic reaction to
anything sei ved in the dining halls. 1
would have even settled tor .1 medical
ly (lim umented <ase of (laustrophobia.
\ow ilia! I ilnnk alxHil it. all ot the above
would h.ive been ideal. A combination ot
these medical conditions, ha< I I entered the
clisabilitv Draw, would have given me a
sweet < liaiue to s<ore a spacions two-room

open Isiu hen, ot course).
but. besides .1 sliiilil < .ise of lactose intol-

considered submitting a
I)isahilit\ Ac< ominodation
Rec|iiesl to opt out of the
dreaded housing Draw.
But cvci v ve.ll around 111 is
lime, llie si ramble to sue -
cessfiillv survive the
Draw yets underway.

( nfortunately, manv students ch<x>se to
cntet llie* disahilit\ draw — even in unnec

Wording to the I lousing Assignment
Sen k cs Wchsitc, students whose disability or
d< k uniented medu al condition necessitates a
parti< nl.ii housiugassignment that c annot be
assured m the regulai I >i aw should enter the
disabilitx Draw. Students seeking "premier
housing spaces or locations" and those
"whose needs are based on a personal
lilcstvle choice" .ire warned not to apply.
I lie polio seems straightforward, but
students have found room for manipulation
within these guidelines. A couple of vital
questions lemain. When is a person's medi
cal condition more than simply inconve
nient? When docs it "necessitate" exemp
tion from the rcgulat Draw?
()bviouslv, someone in a wheelchair has
specific a< cessihilit\ concerns and can only
live ma i crlain t\pcof loom or kxation. but
d< k's s< >uic( me u Ik > has an allergy to peanuts
require a house with a chef and open
kitchen? Sure, it mav Ik- inconvenient to
deal with, but < an t a dining hall accommo
date sikh a person s needs?
Stanford of lit i.ils I sjx>ke with don't believe
11 icy have the right to make these distinctions.
"It's not fair foi us to judge these disabil
ities, Mousing Assignment Services Man
ager I odd licuson said. "I don't want to be
naive. There may be people who scam the
system, but il a doctor says they have a dis
ability, they have one."
In othci words, every application gets
approved.
I cri Adams offered the same explana

tion. As the assistant dim tot ot the I )isabili
tv Resource (lenter, Adams is the pet son rc
sponsible tor processing all disability bous
ing requests.
"We're not in a position to make a diag
nosis," she told me. "I have little reason to
be skeptical il the information provided is
in order."
In other words, a completed appli< at ion
is <in approved application.
As I see it, the problem is that Stanford,
perhaps fearing legal action, errs on the side
of total itu lusion. Disc riminat ion lawsuits arc
commonplace nowadays. Stanford desper
ately wants to avoid these (< >stlv alien al 101 is,
even if some students rc< civc unfitit benefits.
Further compile ating the "necessitv" de
bate is the fact that not all students with dis
abilities 01 medical conditions choose to
enter the disability Draw. I low can the same
condition be a necessary concern fot one
student and.in afterthought tot anothci
with the same condition?
Josh kallman, a sophomore living in
Roble, sutlers from dial)etes and gives him
self injections before every meal. |osh ad
mitted to me that lie could have used (lie
disability 1 )raw to Ins advantage, but he de
cided against it.
"I probably could have ended up some
where like Suites 01 I ovon. one of tnv high
er choices, it 1 had insisted on |a residence
with] an eating club or open kitc hen," lie
said. "1 think if I had claimed disability, it
would have been because I wanted better
housing ... 1 didn't see it as necessary."
The system is so easy to take advantage
of, he said, sharing mv concerns about the
disability Draw's methodology. "You have
to be careful about judging the validity ot
the claims. Certain things seem a lot less like
necessity and a lot more about Irving to get
a nice room.'"
Beyond issues of fairness, abusing the
system docs the greatest injustice to those
who truly rely on it. Rumors of abuse are so
rampant that the disability Draw has lost
credibility among many students. I hose
students who really need spec ial accommo
dations are often ashamed to admit it be
cause they fear people will disbelieve the se
riousness of their condition.
The system needs to be sue h that people
can't exploit it. But, 111 the meantime, the re
sponsibility tor action is ours. I Intil the I 'di
versity comes up w lib a better method < >1 < Ic
termining what ne< essitates spec ial housing
accommodations, we should not continue to
take advantage of an imperfect system.
