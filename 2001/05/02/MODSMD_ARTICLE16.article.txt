Santa Clara supervisors
should 'stand strong'
Fvcrvone agrees that the Carnegie
Inundation does important work, lint this
does not put them above die law.
()n Marc h 20, the lloaicl of Supei \ is«n s
voted 5-0 to require (Carnegie to make the
follow ing ( lunges to its development plan:
1) Con lon n to the ie< enth approved ( oni
munitv I'lan by sitting the entire footprint ot
the project (including' the parking lot and
access road) within the Academic Crowth
boundary;
2) Decrease the si/e and scale ot the
building:
S) Mitigate fin the loss of California tigei
salamander habitat through permanent
conservation easements;
1) Protect the viewshed b\ relocating the
building below the 200-foot elevation level.
5) Kxplorealtei nativesitesth.it would result
in fewer environmental impacts.
Rather than address these issues, the
Carnegie Foundation has chosen to hire
l< (bbyists like |ean Vic ( own to pressure the
supervisors to bat k awa\ from their strong
position. Carnegie has come back with a
plan that onlv partiallv meets one of the sir
pervisor's requirements. Carnegie propos
es moving the building .Hf> feet so that it is
within the Academic Crowth Kounclan.
However, the access road and a portion of
the parking lot would still he locatcd c tut side
the Ac ademic (irow tli lioundan in the Spe
cial ( oiiservation Area. 1 he building would
still be the same si/e (21.000 square feet), it
would still be located above the SOO-foot el
evation mark and the tigei salamanders
would receive no additional protet tion.
I he supervisors should static! strong and
denv ('.arnegie a development permit in the
Foothills. SRI is open to <list ussing a long
term lease for the Carnegie Foundation in
Menlo I'ark, which is a nine It more appro
priate location.

Stanford should 'abide by the laws'
After many months of sometimes ran
corous debate, a compromise ('.ommunitv
Plan for Stanford University's land use and
growth plans was approved In the Board of
Supervisors of Santa Clara County. While
environmentalists got tar less than they
wanted, compromise is to be expec ted in the
political process.
Despite getting a substantial victory in
tins process, Stanford now wants to violate
this law with the development of the pro
posed Carnegie Institute. After being in
structed by the Board of Supervisors to
move the entire project (including park

ing lot .iikl access road) inside the ap
proved A( a<U'liiit (irowtli lloundarv, tlicy
have returned with .1 proposal that egre
giouslv violates this requirement. In addi
tion, the\ ha\'e done .ihsoluteh nothing to
address Ihe oil in three stipulations ot the
board: reducing the si/.e and intensity of
the project, providing conservation ease
ments tot the tigei salamander and pro
tec ling the viewshed.
( aincgie and Stanford want us to think
that tlie\ should he given spe< ial treatment
ltecanse they are "puhli« service" organiza
tions. In fa< t, .ill of us helieve —01 should
Ix'lieve — that we provide a public set a ue 111
some a spec I of oiii lives. and all of us must
abide b\ the same laws. St.inlord I 'nivei sii\
is not an e\< eption.

Board should reject Carnegie plan
In their March 20 decision, the- Santa
Clara supervisors required Stanford I ni
versity and the Carnegie Foundation to
meet five requirements in order to a< hieve
approval of their plans. Stanford and
Carnegie have put forth .1 plan that meets
one of the five requirements, such as to
move the building lower on the hillside and
plant some trees to screen the building.
I licit plan continues to violate the land
use requirements that Stanford recently
agreed to. I hc\ have shown their disregard
for the Board of Supervisors In tailing toad
dress the other tour requirements: I he
plan still has elements outside of the Aca
demic Growth Boundary; the size of the
building has not been reduced; they have
not addressed permanent protection or
mitigation for the endangered California
tiger salamander (an awesome creature, if
you've Ih'cu luckv enough to see one); and

they continue to refuse to explore alterna
tive sites. In lad, t lie SRI in Ylenlo I'ark has
ottered to work with ('.ai negie to create a site
on their campus, hut Carnegie won't cur
rently << msider it.
I he Board of Supervisors should re jet I
this plan, as it rejected the previous ver
sion, he< ause it does not meet the land use
rc<|uii ctncnts the) have set forth. (larnegie
and Stanford are again displa\ ing their ai -
re >gance in disregarding the de( ision of the
hoard, and the board should rightly hold
its ground.
\\ hy won t Stanford let ('.arnegie devel
op its building elsewhere on Stanford's
lands? Because any land that is approved
for development has .1 large cash value, and
Stanford doesn t want to give up the income
opportunit\ lot the SI rent tliev have ol
fered (larnegie. \\ h\ is Si an f«>rd "generous
ly "offering ( '.arnegie a $ I rent? Because it is
('.arnegie as the "< amel's nose under
the tent, to crack open the foothills for fur
ther development.
()nce Stanl< >rd can set a precedent of de
velopment in tlie area that the\ have onlv re
cent 1\ .tgreed to set aside for 25 years, it will
continue to work at putting more develop
ment in the 112 oothills, outside the Academic
(irowtli Boundary. I he land Stanford has
ottered ('.arnegie doesn't have a cash rent
value because it can't he developed.
Stanford supporters have written al>out
the importance of the (lat negie 112 oundation
in supporting teachers. These arguments
have nothing to do with the land use issues
that tlie Board of Supervisors is addressing.
(Carnegie was able to write a check for $5() for
the widow of a teacher when it wasn't in the
Foothills, .tnd it will continue to he able to do
its work wherever it is located in the future.
