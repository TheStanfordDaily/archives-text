Santa Clara supervisors
should 'stand strong'
Fvcrvone agrees that the Carnegie
Inundation does important work, lint this
does not put them above die law.
()n Marc h 20, the lloaicl of Supei \ is«n s
voted 5-0 to require (Carnegie to make the
follow ing ( lunges to its development plan:
1) Con lon n to the ie< enth approved ( oni
munitv I'lan by sitting the entire footprint ot
the project (including' the parking lot and
access road) within the Academic Crowth
boundary;
2) Decrease the si/e and scale ot the
building:
S) Mitigate fin the loss of California tigei
salamander habitat through permanent
conservation easements;
1) Protect the viewshed b\ relocating the
building below the 200-foot elevation level.
5) Kxplorealtei nativesitesth.it would result
in fewer environmental impacts.
Rather than address these issues, the
Carnegie Foundation has chosen to hire
l< (bbyists like |ean Vic ( own to pressure the
supervisors to bat k awa\ from their strong
position. Carnegie has come back with a
plan that onlv partiallv meets one of the sir
pervisor's requirements. Carnegie propos
es moving the building .Hf> feet so that it is
within the Academic Crowth Kounclan.
However, the access road and a portion of
the parking lot would still he locatcd c tut side
the Ac ademic (irow tli lioundan in the Spe
cial ( oiiservation Area. 1 he building would
still be the same si/e (21.000 square feet), it
would still be located above the SOO-foot el
evation mark and the tigei salamanders
would receive no additional protet tion.
I he supervisors should static! strong and
denv ('.arnegie a development permit in the
Foothills. SRI is open to <list ussing a long
term lease for the Carnegie Foundation in
Menlo I'ark, which is a nine It more appro
priate location.

Stanford should 'abide by the laws'
After many months of sometimes ran
corous debate, a compromise ('.ommunitv
Plan for Stanford University's land use and
growth plans was approved In the Board of
Supervisors of Santa Clara County. While
environmentalists got tar less than they
wanted, compromise is to be expec ted in the
political process.
Despite getting a substantial victory in
tins process, Stanford now wants to violate
this law with the development of the pro
posed Carnegie Institute. After being in
structed by the Board of Supervisors to
move the entire project (including park

ing lot .iikl access road) inside the ap
proved A( a<U'liiit (irowtli lloundarv, tlicy
have returned with .1 proposal that egre
giouslv violates this requirement. In addi
tion, the\ ha\'e done .ihsoluteh nothing to
address Ihe oil in three stipulations ot the
board: reducing the si/.e and intensity of
the project, providing conservation ease
ments tot the tigei salamander and pro
tec ling the viewshed.
( aincgie and Stanford want us to think
that tlie\ should he given spe< ial treatment
ltecanse they are "puhli« service" organiza
tions. In fa< t, .ill of us helieve —01 should
Ix'lieve — that we provide a public set a ue 111
some a spec I of oiii lives. and all of us must
abide b\ the same laws. St.inlord I 'nivei sii\
is not an e\< eption.

Board should reject Carnegie plan
In their March 20 decision, the- Santa
Clara supervisors required Stanford I ni
versity and the Carnegie Foundation to
meet five requirements in order to a< hieve
approval of their plans. Stanford and
Carnegie have put forth .1 plan that meets
one of the five requirements, such as to
move the building lower on the hillside and
plant some trees to screen the building.
I licit plan continues to violate the land
use requirements that Stanford recently
agreed to. I hc\ have shown their disregard
for the Board of Supervisors In tailing toad
dress the other tour requirements: I he
plan still has elements outside of the Aca
demic Growth Boundary; the size of the
building has not been reduced; they have
not addressed permanent protection or
mitigation for the endangered California
tiger salamander (an awesome creature, if
you've Ih'cu luckv enough to see one); and

they continue to refuse to explore alterna
tive sites. In lad, t lie SRI in Ylenlo I'ark has
ottered to work with ('.ai negie to create a site
on their campus, hut Carnegie won't cur
rently << msider it.
I he Board of Supervisors should re jet I
this plan, as it rejected the previous ver
sion, he< ause it does not meet the land use
rc<|uii ctncnts the) have set forth. (larnegie
and Stanford are again displa\ ing their ai -
re >gance in disregarding the de( ision of the
hoard, and the board should rightly hold
its ground.
\\ hy won t Stanford let ('.arnegie devel
op its building elsewhere on Stanford's
lands? Because any land that is approved
for development has .1 large cash value, and
Stanford doesn t want to give up the income
opportunit\ lot the SI rent tliev have ol
fered (larnegie. \\ h\ is Si an f«>rd "generous
ly "offering ( '.arnegie a $ I rent? Because it is
('.arnegie as the "< amel's nose under
the tent, to crack open the foothills for fur
ther development.
()nce Stanl< >rd can set a precedent of de
velopment in tlie area that the\ have onlv re
cent 1\ .tgreed to set aside for 25 years, it will
continue to work at putting more develop
ment in the 112 oothills, outside the Academic
(irowtli Boundary. I he land Stanford has
ottered ('.arnegie doesn't have a cash rent
value because it can't he developed.
Stanford supporters have written al>out
the importance of the (lat negie 112 oundation
in supporting teachers. These arguments
have nothing to do with the land use issues
that tlie Board of Supervisors is addressing.
(Carnegie was able to write a check for $5() for
the widow of a teacher when it wasn't in the
Foothills, .tnd it will continue to he able to do
its work wherever it is located in the future.

Carnegie plans lack 'responsibility
to the environment'
I xt Shulman's assertion that Santa ( liaia
Count\ Supervisor Li/ Kniss ( hansel the
ink's t<»i approval of the ( .11 negic building
l>\ requiring modifications to its pi.lll afiei
tlic planning commission approved 11 is an
attempt to hide the tad that the planning
commissions approval was illegal in the first
plaee. kniss and the board were mereh up
holding the requirements of the general
plan under stale law.
Carnegie's revised plan is .1 less than
half-hearted attempt to meet the supervi
sors criteria tot approval; the building's
si/e has not been fleet eased, the aeeess toad
is still in the special conservation area and
the tiger salamander will receive no addi

tional protections. ( '.arncgic's l.nvironmen
tal Impact Report is legalh inadequate be
cause no alternative siu-s lot the pro jet t are
proposed as required l>\ state law . ( arnegic
dose not need a "hillside villa" to fulfill its
acadcmit mission.
Stanford's argument that the t ore t am
pus area is reserved onl\ foi housing and
t lassrooms is inact urate: Stanford expressly
asked for the newk approved communit\
plan to allow for non-profit foundations in
the core campus area. I he Hoovct Institu
tion and (-arnegie foundation of Washing
ton are examples of non-Stanford non-prof
its 111 the core < ampus area.

I challenge (larnegie to bat k up its noble

Every child should come
from a 'wanted pregnancy'
I .mi writing on bcliall of the Stanford
Chapter of Medical Students For Choke, a
sc liool representative, regarding the April 2(i
ai tide, "IYo-life feminist oflet s c liallenge."
I want to extend applause to Serrin 112 os
ter for her efforts in addressing pregnancy
in Noting women, particularly college stu
dents. Ys .in advocate for preserving a
W(>111.111 s right to clhm»sc, I see a great sinii
larit\ in oiii respective causes because the
issue really is about women. As <i feminist,
in\ goal is to enable women to i hoose the
course ot their life. If that means(hoosing to
liecome .i mother, there should be support
systems in place at the I nivcrsit\ and in
public life to facilitate- that choice. If that
means c boosing not tc»bee ome ,i niothei, we
need to in.ikc- sure that she has the support
s\ stem for that c boic e.
lleing pro-choice." to me, means
making sure that ever\ person who be
c onies a pai ent does so because they have

considered all the options and thev really
want that privilege. I Itimatelv, I think
that we all treasure life. Speaking for m\
group, 112 think the important issue is that
we should always have the choice of
whether parenting is right foi each of us
and when. And. \es. when we decide to
become parents, we should have all the
support in the world for tli.it decision,
from out school and community. I o sa\
that we deserve "better (ban abortion" is
absoluteb true, but we don't always have
such luxuries. Abortion is not the only
choice. It is just one option that impera
tivel\ needs to remain open. We also de
serve better than a lot ot othei obstacles
that we are forced to overcome.
Abortion lor main people is not the
most pleasant decision they will make.
And the dramatic , life-changing adjust
ments in the middle of college is unthink
able foi some. \ I \ biggest reason for w i it -
ing ibis lettei is to remind the Stanford
community that even child should come
from a "wanted pregnancy" into a home
that will comfortably and secureh nurture

him or her. And everyone who becomes a
parent should want to.
