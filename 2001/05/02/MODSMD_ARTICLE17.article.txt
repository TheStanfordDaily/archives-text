# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Lack of campus support doomed Jewish-Muslim celebration 
### KAREEM GHANEM BEN LILIEN GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Ovei ilu- |usi i wo (juarters, we have
Iteen attempting (o develop a <am-
puswide event bringing together
diflerent religious and cultural
groups part icularlv Jewish and Muslim stu
dents in a (ivili/rd exploration of our re
spective tail I is. Hie event, \\ hit li was to Ik- titled
A( .elehration of Jerusalem," was meant to cre
ate <in atmosphere in which a respedlul dia
logue could oc< uralKiut the mote wieiu hingis
sues in the Middle Kast.
Additionally the event was meant to edu
cate the Stanford community ahout different
groups ties to Jerusalem and win the < «>nlli( t
in the Middle Kast continues to create hate and
mistrust among Clu istians, Muslims and |ews
who live li.ill a world awa\ .it Stanford I nivei
sity. We thought it might he insli m live tooffer
our own reflections on the mam challenges we
have lac ed as we have attempted to make this
event a reality.
Hut, first, let's all agree on one basic fact
about the conllic t and its relation to Stanford
students: Simply put, in their dail\ lives. Jew
ish and Muslim students at Stanford are over
whelmingh unaffected In the conflict. K.xcept

fora small group of Palestinian and Israeli
students 011 campus, most Jews and Muslims
here have little more than a nebulous moral
or religious connection to the issue.
Surprisingly, though, tensions run re
inarkabK high when discussion turns to the
Middle Kast turmoil. Whether it is their inabil
ity to act c i\ il toward professot s speaking in an
academk setting about the conflict, or the
seemingly predictable wax in which thev (lis
respect the personal expressions of othei sin
dents, Stanford students can be jarringlx i ude
and downright despicable when addressing
Middle Kastern politic s.
It was within this context that we naivelx set
out to confront these problems < >11 < ainpns. We
never thought that the hatred and venomous
mistrust on thisi ampin would run so deep as to
make our event imp< >ssible.
From the verx beginning, our event has
been criticized In most of the people whose
support we sought. Islamic, Jewish, Protes
tant and ( atholii student groups ollered
ample "concerns" about win the event would
be difficult. We have been accused ol every
thing from "sugar coating" the sullering of
the Palestinians to planning "childish ex
liibits" to "not including enough perspec
tives (»n the issues we hoped to explore.

We met with administrators at ilie Oflice
<>l Student Allairs who — rather than en
tourage our goal — chose to dwell on the dif
ficulties <>l planning a campuswide event, pi
geonholing it with mildly related programs
that already existed. It is worth mentioning,
however, that the deans ol religious life were
not onlv fully supportive, hui had a keen un
derstanding of our goals and their impor
tance on this campus, agreeing to act as spon
sors for the event.
< )ii a in*>re person,il note, we have been ac
cused several times of betraying our respec
tive communities (Jewish and Muslim), of
I >t'ii ij4 disbelievers, and of svmpathizing
with the enemy, (.iven th.it religion has al
wavs informed both of our lives and that we
both have .1 great sense of pride iu our re
spective communities, these ( barges were es
pe« ially hurtful. Over the course of the last
two quarters, we have even found ourselves
loolishh (juestioning our own motives in or
ganizing this event.
Moreover, students from the diflerent
(ommuuities with whom we have met have
< ontiuualh expressed.istonislunent that Mus
lim and Jewish students would .u tuallv work
togethei on such a projet 1.1 pon learning thai
we are actuallv roommates and ver\ close

friends, tlieir astonishment turns to suspicion
and subtle disapproval.
A Muslim-Jewish friendship is. 111 the eves of
many 011 tills campus, a novelty — or, for some,
an im|N>ssibilitv. Apparently, some students feel
we should treat eat h other as the (lapulets and
Montagues, the Hatfields and McCo\s 01 Is
raelis and Arabs taking pail iu the age old tradi
tion of trading rocks and bullets in the streets of
Jerusalem. Kven those who sup|M>rted our ef
forts spoke to lis as if we were .1 sonal experi
lneni or a "dialogue group."
More disturbing, though, is that, as we
have worked with many Muslim and Jewish
students on campus, we have seen first hand
the distrust that we had hoped to address.
On one hand, one group constantly ques
tioned the ability of the other group to put
on .1 non-political displav. At the same time,
theothei group fell it was being manipulat
ed and strong-armed into participating.
1 here exists an inherited sense of suspicion
and a deep-seated haired between Muslims
and Jews. Kven our personal interactions
with members of other communities are
1 louded l>\ an awkward sense of lat 11 skepti
cism and animosity.
We <]uickl\ found thai the purpose of our
event was obscured In our proud desire to

live up to Ihe expectations we had created.
We worked with a li.iiidtiil of dedicated stu
dents to plan exhibits of art, literature and
histon pertaining to the Middle Kast. We in
vested countless hours in bringing an Arab
band, an Israeli dance troupe and a Middle
Eastern food vendor to campus in order to
make the event asia cess i\ it Ik nit realizing
(hat the ver\ people thisevent wast reatedfor
weren't planning to participate. I his week
end. after agonizing over what we could do,
we canceled the event.

immense task we took on. I lowever, we want
to place this issue before the entire Stanford

some deaf ears, we hope that someone out

Hut, first, let's all agree on one basic fact
about the conllic t and its relation to Stanford
students: Simply put, in their dail\ lives. Jew
ish and Muslim students at Stanford are over
whelmingh unaffected In the conflict. K.xcept

fora small group of Palestinian and Israeli
students 011 campus, most Jews and Muslims
here have little more than a nebulous moral
or religious connection to the issue.
Surprisingly, though, tensions run re
inarkabK high when discussion turns to the
Middle Kast turmoil. Whether it is their inabil
ity to act c i\ il toward professot s speaking in an
academk setting about the conflict, or the
seemingly predictable wax in which thev (lis
respect the personal expressions of othei sin
dents, Stanford students can be jarringlx i ude
and downright despicable when addressing
Middle Kastern politic s.
It was within this context that we naivelx set
out to confront these problems < >11 < ainpns. We
never thought that the hatred and venomous
mistrust on thisi ampin would run so deep as to
make our event imp< >ssible.
From the verx beginning, our event has
been criticized In most of the people whose
support we sought. Islamic, Jewish, Protes
tant and ( atholii student groups ollered
ample "concerns" about win the event would
be difficult. We have been accused ol every
thing from "sugar coating" the sullering of
the Palestinians to planning "childish ex
liibits" to "not including enough perspec
tives (»n the issues we hoped to explore.

We met with administrators at ilie Oflice
<>l Student Allairs who — rather than en
tourage our goal — chose to dwell on the dif
ficulties <>l planning a campuswide event, pi
geonholing it with mildly related programs
that already existed. It is worth mentioning,
however, that the deans ol religious life were
not onlv fully supportive, hui had a keen un
derstanding of our goals and their impor
tance on this campus, agreeing to act as spon
sors for the event.
< )ii a in*>re person,il note, we have been ac

with the enemy, (.iven th.it religion has al

both have .1 great sense of pride iu our re
spective communities, these ( barges were es
pe« ially hurtful. Over the course of the last
two quarters, we have even found ourselves
loolishh (juestioning our own motives in or
ganizing this event.

(ommuuities with whom we have met have
< ontiuualh expressed.istonislunent that Mus

an im|N>ssibilitv. Apparently, some students feel
we should treat eat h other as the (lapulets and
