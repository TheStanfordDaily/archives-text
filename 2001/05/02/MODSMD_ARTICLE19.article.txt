# Ten Reasons Why You Shouldn't Be Fooled By David Horowitz's Ad — and Why It's Racist Too.
## (Stanford Black Student Union, May 2001) 
### 
Most importantly, we must never fall victim to schemes designed to create a controversy among potential
allies in order to divide them and, at the same time, exploit them for its own special purpose."
—John Hope Franklin, Historian

1. We question David Horowitz's true motivation in placing this ad.
David Horowitz has placed this ad in more than 50 school newspapers
across the nation, including UC-Berkeley, Brown University and Duke Uni
versity. Ihe ad cost an average ol $700. In response to its publication,
Horowitz has been interviewed by several media sources and invited to
speak at campuses about his views. Inevitably, Horowit/ s campaign has
proven profitable for him and his Center for the Study of Popular Culture.
2. Horowitz's ad utilizes tactics of racial division to divert attention from
the issue of reparations.
Horowitz aims to divide potential allies by portraying the question of
reparations as a dispute between Blacks and other Americans. I n doing t his,
he hopes to cause division between African Americans and the rest of the
population, for example, at I C-Berkeley and Brown, racial tensions have
heightened due to the publication of the ad. In attempting to instigate con
flict between different ethnic groups, the ad ignores the fact that reparations
would be paid by the U.S. government and relevant corporations rather
than by individual citizens or groups, just as has been done in earlier repa
rations cases.
3. Horowitz's disregards parallels between claims for African-American
reparations and other successful claims for reparations.
Both Japanese descendants of internment camp survivors during World
War II and Jewish victims of the Holocaust have received reparations years
after the relevant injury was committed. Horowitz claims that "this would be
the only case of reparations to people who were not immediately affected
and whose sole qualification would be racial. I lowever, many of the benefi
ciaries of these internment reparations were also not directly affected, yet
still felt the effects of the wrong done to t heir ancestors, just as African Amer
icans felt and continue to feel the effects of slavery long after emancipation.
Slavery was a racialized institution that exclusively affected Black Ameri
/ /
cans, just as internment exclusively affected Japanese Americans. These
cases are more similar than I lorowitz claims.
4. Horowitz misinforms people about the goals of reparations proponents
and the ways in which reparations would be made.
Not all advocates for African-American reparations are asking for indi
vidual economic restitution. Many leaders, like Randall Robinson, seek
reparations in the form of institutional improvements: community build
ing and educational benefits for Black communities. This disproves
Horowitz's claim that reparations supporters are only asking for "an ex
travagant new handout."
5. Horowitz misconstrues the basis of the reparations argument.
I he reparations argument is about payment for the use of 112 ree labor, disen
franchisement and legal discrimination against Blacks — not about the eco
nomic status of African Americans today. Despite the status of middle and up
perclass blacks right now, reparations advocates want payments for the hun
dreds ol years that Blacks worked as slaves in a governmentally condoned
slave system. In addition, reparations should accrue for the years Blacks were
not able to vote and were legally discriminated against. Even though the Black
middle class continues to grow, the Black working and underclass is still large,
and there remains a great disparity between average incomes for Blacks and
Whites. In 1998, the median White family income in the United States was
$49, 023; the median Black family income was $29, 404, just 60 percent of the
median White income ( 2001 New York limes Almanac, p. 319).

6. Horowitz ignores the struggles endured by African Americans to win
freedom in America.
Several Blacks led the abolition movement. For example, Harriet Tubman
led hundreds of Blacks to freedom through the Underground Railroad,
and Frederick Douglass, a major African-American abolitionist, and David
Walker wrote several essays imploring the emancipation of slaves. While rec
ognizing that \\ hites did die in the Civil War on behalf of the Union army,
1 lorowitz neglects to address the Civil War as a light over Confederate suc
cession, not slavery.
7. Horowitz's point that African Americans owe a debt to America is of
fensive and grounded in racist ideology.
1 lorowitz suggests that Blacks should be grateful to Whites for bestowing
upon them basic civil rights. He says Blacks should be thankful to Abraham
Lincoln for signing the Emancipation Proclamation, although it did not end
slavery in America.(I he 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution did).
1 he suggestion that freedom is something Blacks should be thankful for im
plies that 1 lorowitz does not view it as an inherent right for Blacks.
8. Horowitz is wrong in concluding that reparations have already been paid
to African Americans in the form of welfare benefits and Affirmative Action.
Welfare was created in the 1930s to aid poor Americans and victims of the
(•real Depression, and Affirmative Action was created in the post-Civil
Rights hi a to combat modern discrimination against women and minorities.
In neither program were Blacks the only, or even primary, beneficiaries of
these federal programs. Neither program pays Blacks back for the work
done by their slave ancestors, for the years of legal discrimination, educa
tional and occupational stultification, or for the harassment and persecution
that followed slavery. Indeed, discrimination continues in modified forms
today. By making untrue statements about American policy decisions,
Horowitz once again misconstrues the aims and arguments of the repara
tions movement.
9. Horowitz bases his argument on a false assumption that African Ameri
cans have had ample time and equal opportunity since emancipation to
progress economically.
Robert Crisman and Ernest Allen Jr. write that President Andrew Johnson
rescinded the only order that empowered Union commanders to give newly
freed slaves assistance (the infamous "40 acres and a mule" clause). The orig
inal "reparations" were never paid to Blacks, Blacks endured years of legal
discrimination (through Jim Crow laws) and there continues to be discrimi
nation (e.g. racial profiling) that perpetuates inequality. Furthermore,
Blacks across the United States were guaranteed voting rights and protec
tion from discrimination only 36 years ago, a little more than a generation,
lb conclude that Blacks should be economically and educationally equal to
Whites today is to put unrealistic and uniformed expectations upon Blacks.
10. Horowitz contradicts American ideals of unity by ignoring collective
responsibility.
As citizens of this country, we assume collective responsibility for the debts
and actions of our government. The national debt doesn't fall on any one in
dividual; it is the responsibility of the country as a whole — as is paying repa
rations. When America goes to war, we must all endure costs in the form of
conscriptions and debt. We accept these responsibilities as citizens of this
country. Reparations are not a separatist idea. Instead, it encourages the
government to take responsibility for wrongs committed against African
Americans that it condoned and even facilitated.

Moving beyond myopic and divisive quibbles raised by Horowitz, the Black Student Union wishes to conclude by voicing its support for actions that
bring about equality for all people in our society. This is an important principle to remember in light of the hate crimes recently committed on campus
All groups are not treated and valued the same in this country. Because all Americans deserve equal access to the prosperity of this country, we recog
nize and applaud attempts to create educational and economic equality as bringing us closer to the goal of a truly egalitarian and democratic society.
WE REMAIN COMMITT ED TO THE EQUALITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF ALL.

franchisement and legal discrimination against Blacks — not about the eco
nomic status of African Americans today. Despite the status of middle and up
perclass blacks right now, reparations advocates want payments for the hun
dreds ol years that Blacks worked as slaves in a governmentally condoned
slave system. In addition, reparations should accrue for the years Blacks were
not able to vote and were legally discriminated against. Even though the Black
middle class continues to grow, the Black working and underclass is still large,
and there remains a great disparity between average incomes for Blacks and
Whites. In 1998, the median White family income in the United States was
$49, 023; the median Black family income was $29, 404, just 60 percent of the
median White income ( 2001 New York limes Almanac, p. 319).

6. Horowitz ignores the struggles endured by African Americans to win
freedom in America.
Several Blacks led the abolition movement. For example, Harriet Tubman
led hundreds of Blacks to freedom through the Underground Railroad,
and Frederick Douglass, a major African-American abolitionist, and David
Walker wrote several essays imploring the emancipation of slaves. While rec
ognizing that \\ hites did die in the Civil War on behalf of the Union army,
1 lorowitz neglects to address the Civil War as a light over Confederate suc
cession, not slavery.
7. Horowitz's point that African Americans owe a debt to America is of
fensive and grounded in racist ideology.
1 lorowitz suggests that Blacks should be grateful to Whites for bestowing
upon them basic civil rights. He says Blacks should be thankful to Abraham
Lincoln for signing the Emancipation Proclamation, although it did not end
slavery in America.(I he 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution did).
1 he suggestion that freedom is something Blacks should be thankful for im
plies that 1 lorowitz does not view it as an inherent right for Blacks.
8. Horowitz is wrong in concluding that reparations have already been paid
to African Americans in the form of welfare benefits and Affirmative Action.
Welfare was created in the 1930s to aid poor Americans and victims of the
(•real Depression, and Affirmative Action was created in the post-Civil
Rights hi a to combat modern discrimination against women and minorities.
In neither program were Blacks the only, or even primary, beneficiaries of
these federal programs. Neither program pays Blacks back for the work
done by their slave ancestors, for the years of legal discrimination, educa
tional and occupational stultification, or for the harassment and persecution
that followed slavery. Indeed, discrimination continues in modified forms
today. By making untrue statements about American policy decisions,
Horowitz once again misconstrues the aims and arguments of the repara
tions movement.
9. Horowitz bases his argument on a false assumption that African Ameri
cans have had ample time and equal opportunity since emancipation to
progress economically.
Robert Crisman and Ernest Allen Jr. write that President Andrew Johnson
rescinded the only order that empowered Union commanders to give newly
freed slaves assistance (the infamous "40 acres and a mule" clause). The orig
inal "reparations" were never paid to Blacks, Blacks endured years of legal
discrimination (through Jim Crow laws) and there continues to be discrimi
nation (e.g. racial profiling) that perpetuates inequality. Furthermore,
Blacks across the United States were guaranteed voting rights and protec
tion from discrimination only 36 years ago, a little more than a generation,
lb conclude that Blacks should be economically and educationally equal to
Whites today is to put unrealistic and uniformed expectations upon Blacks.
10. Horowitz contradicts American ideals of unity by ignoring collective
responsibility.
As citizens of this country, we assume collective responsibility for the debts
and actions of our government. The national debt doesn't fall on any one in
dividual; it is the responsibility of the country as a whole — as is paying repa
rations. When America goes to war, we must all endure costs in the form of
conscriptions and debt. We accept these responsibilities as citizens of this
country. Reparations are not a separatist idea. Instead, it encourages the
government to take responsibility for wrongs committed against African
Americans that it condoned and even facilitated.

Moving beyond myopic and divisive quibbles raised by Horowitz, the Black Student Union wishes to conclude by voicing its support for actions that
bring about equality for all people in our society. This is an important principle to remember in light of the hate crimes recently committed on campus
All groups are not treated and valued the same in this country. Because all Americans deserve equal access to the prosperity of this country, we recog
nize and applaud attempts to create educational and economic equality as bringing us closer to the goal of a truly egalitarian and democratic society.
WE REMAIN COMMITT ED TO THE EQUALITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF ALL.

1. We question David Horowitz's true motivation in placing this ad.
David Horowitz has placed this ad in more than 50 school newspapers
across the nation, including UC-Berkeley, Brown University and Duke Uni
versity. Ihe ad cost an average ol $700. In response to its publication,
Horowitz has been interviewed by several media sources and invited to
speak at campuses about his views. Inevitably, Horowit/ s campaign has
proven profitable for him and his Center for the Study of Popular Culture.
2. Horowitz's ad utilizes tactics of racial division to divert attention from
the issue of reparations.
Horowitz aims to divide potential allies by portraying the question of
reparations as a dispute between Blacks and other Americans. I n doing t his,
he hopes to cause division between African Americans and the rest of the
population, for example, at I C-Berkeley and Brown, racial tensions have
heightened due to the publication of the ad. In attempting to instigate con
flict between different ethnic groups, the ad ignores the fact that reparations
would be paid by the U.S. government and relevant corporations rather
than by individual citizens or groups, just as has been done in earlier repa
rations cases.
3. Horowitz's disregards parallels between claims for African-American
reparations and other successful claims for reparations.
Both Japanese descendants of internment camp survivors during World
War II and Jewish victims of the Holocaust have received reparations years
after the relevant injury was committed. Horowitz claims that "this would be
the only case of reparations to people who were not immediately affected
and whose sole qualification would be racial. I lowever, many of the benefi
ciaries of these internment reparations were also not directly affected, yet
still felt the effects of the wrong done to t heir ancestors, just as African Amer
icans felt and continue to feel the effects of slavery long after emancipation.
Slavery was a racialized institution that exclusively affected Black Ameri
/ /
cans, just as internment exclusively affected Japanese Americans. These
cases are more similar than I lorowitz claims.
4. Horowitz misinforms people about the goals of reparations proponents
and the ways in which reparations would be made.
Not all advocates for African-American reparations are asking for indi
vidual economic restitution. Many leaders, like Randall Robinson, seek
reparations in the form of institutional improvements: community build
ing and educational benefits for Black communities. This disproves
Horowitz's claim that reparations supporters are only asking for "an ex
travagant new handout."
