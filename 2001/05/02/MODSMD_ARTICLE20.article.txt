"Asa [resident assistant), I ve found that late
night discussions about religion do exist, hut
whether we have a way to talk about religion in
larger groups is what we're trying to address,
I leidary said.
"We wanted to find a way to have a sacred
space for these conversations. Service Learn
ing Coordinator Kent Koth added.

"One question that sometimes comes up is
how does one maintain commitment to social
change, Koth said. "One answer is to have
something to fall back upon, (such as religion],
when the\ ask themselves why they do servit e."
"This is just about creating .1 bridge that
hasn't existed before," lleidan said.
