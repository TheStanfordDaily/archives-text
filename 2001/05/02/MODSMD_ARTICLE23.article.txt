Klansinan was convicted of murder vesterelav for
the 19(>!t church bombing that killetl torn black
girls, the deadliest single attack during the civil
rights movement.
I homas Blanton )r., t)2, was sentenced to life in
pi ison b\ the same jurv that found him guiltv after 2
I 2 hours ol deliberations. Belore he was let I out of
the courtroom in handcuffs, he was asked if he had
any comment.
"I guess the good Ford will settle ii on judgment
day,"he said.
Blanton was accused ol helping other Klansmen
plant a powerful bomb that went off at the Sixteenth
Street Baptist Church on Sept. la, |{MW, .1 Sunday
morning.
During closing arguments, l .S. Attorney Doug
Jones told the juiv of eight whites and four blacks
that it was "never too late for justice." I le said Blan
ton acted in response to months ol civil rights
demonstrations.
"Tom Blanton saw change and didn't like it,"
Jones saitl as black-and-white images of the church
and the girls dressed 111 Sunday c lothing flashed on
video screens in the pat ked courtroom.
Assistant I LS. Atlornev Robert Posey added: "The

killed someone and .is long as that person was black."
" I'hese children must not have dietl in vain," he
said. "Don't let the deafening blast of his bomb be
w hat's left ringing in our ears."
Defense lawyer John Robbins saitl the govern
ment relied on murky tapes of his client secretlv
recorded by the FBI and proved onlv that Blanton
was once a foul-mouthed segregationist, not a
bomber.
I he bomb ripped through an exterior wall of the
brick church. I he bodies ol Denise McNair, 1 I.and
Atldie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley and Carole
Robertson, all 14, were found in the downstairs

fied as suspects within weeks, though the Justice De
partment later concluded that prosecution was
blot ketl by then-Director J. Kdgar I loovcr.
I lie FBI planted a hidden microphone in Blan
ton's apartment in 1964 and taped his conversa
tions with Mitchell Burns, a fellow Klansman
turncd-informant.
I'osey went over the tapes lor jurors, putting tran
script excerpts on the video screens. He read from
one transcript in which Blanton describes himself to
Burns as a clean-cut guy: "I like to go shooting, 1 like
to go fishing, I like to go bombing."
