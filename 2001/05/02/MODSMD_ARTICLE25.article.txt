SPORTS NOTEBOOK

( in rentl\ ranked No. in the country, ul
timate is riding .1 12-game winning streak
into the postseason and more than making
up lor an line haracteristie alh slow start that
saw Stanford (hop out of the top 20 for the
first time in main years.
()n Friday, the team will travel to Seattle
lor the Northwest Regionals. I he winner of
this tournament will receive .1 berth into the
national tournament, held in Boston at the
end o! the month. Because only one team
from the region will advance, the pressure is
on. as Stanford hopes to sec ure its eighth
straight appearance in the 101.11 nanient.
Among the Hi-team field, the main teams
battling Stan lord 101 the- coveted bid are ('.al
ilornia, I ('.-Santa (au/, I ( '.-Davis and Ore
g<>ll. I lowcxcr. "Bloodthirsty" has fared well
against these opponents, espec ially ol late.
While the team li.is yet to f.u c ()rcgon, Stan
ford is j-2 against these- rivals, including a
sweep of (lal. I C-Santa Cru/. and I (.-Davis
at the recent sectionals.
IVaking lateK. Stanford has high expec -
tations .is the postseason begins. At a tour
nament earlier this year, "Bloodthirsty"
beat perhaps its biggest nemesis, top
ranked ( arleton College, for the first time
in three vears.
Winning on a nimble maneuver by |it

"Jumbo" Bhattacharva, a master's student
in mechanical engineering, the it-am si
lenced any doubts about its level of play
compared to that of the (op team in the
land. The victory had an even more special
meaning, considering the fad that (larleton
has knocked Stanford out of nationals each
ol the past two seasons.
(Mail the team's big wins this season, Stan
ford has relied on depth to plow through its
opponents. According to co-captain Dan
Maidenberg, the team "doesn't have just ,i
couple standouts, but rather the whole team
contributes every game."
1 wen so. teammates ac knowledge that Jeff
"The Mac hine" Dicarlo, a graduate student
in electronic engineering, anchors the de
fense as an intimidating deep defender In
using his long frame and jumping ability to
stifle opponents.
|unior Damn "(.aclet" ( ox poses a threat
for opponents with bis speed and quickness.
I lowever. it's difficult to make a list of play
ers that greatly contribute to the team's suc -
cess because of the vast range of strong per
formers that coach Mike Payne has molded
into a cohesive, powerful unit.
Pavne is "the main reason for our succ ess
this vear because of his dedication and guid
ance, as well .is his dynamic offensive and de
fensive strategies." Maidenberg said.
"Bloodthirsty" is certainly different from
the usual "(".animal" nic kname that Stanford
teams normally use. Furthermore, each team
member is given his own unique ultimate
nicknamc, ranging from I flint "Pork (lliop"
Allcott to Brandon "Ponv-Slaver" Hvde — a
reference to bis accentuated mullet.
In no way, however, is intensity
lacking when Stanford steps foot
onto the playing field. A team does
not compile .1 ranking of third 111
the nation bv joking its way
through games.
Needless to sav, the team is
readv !<>i this weekend's region
al, and, il its name means any
thing, one could expect the team
to sei/e the opportunity and go
toi the kill.
Rugby
I his weekend, the men's
rugbv team dosed out a living
season with an impressive show
ing at the Santa Barbara tourna
ment, where they heat I (.-Santa
Barbara, UC-Davis and the Uni
versity of Nevada at Reno before
losing to .1 powerful Colorado
team in the finals.
I bis season was a tough one fbt

tnanv close defeats and numerous

I towever, Stanford still showed
glimpses of greatness at various
moments. ()neof the brightest mo
ments fin the (lard was its come
back victory over l('.-Davis, the
second strongest team 111 the
league, in the final league game of
the seas*>n.
I lie team maintained ".1 ver\
positive outlook and attitude
throughout the season, which will
be a healtln base for more chal
lenges to come," head coach
