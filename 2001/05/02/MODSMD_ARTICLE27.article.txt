# Crew approaching end of season
## After up-and-down season, Cardinal ready for Pac-10s 
### TERRY HURLBUTT 
Uecause it boasts a brand-new coach
and a team <»112 walk-ons, the Stanford
men's crew team will look to a bright In
line while preparing lor the < oik lusiouof
its np-and-down season this year.
I lie Cardinal started the spring sea
son strong with wins against both Santa
Clara and Sacramento State. Stanford
also took home .1 second-place finish in
the prestigious ( <>ple\ (aip Petite finals at
the San Diego drew Classic by beating
Purdue and Sacramento State and falling
to Temple.
But the Cardinal did not tare quite as
well in Pacific 10 Conference dual-race
defeats to both, top-ranked California
and No. 12 Oregon State.
Unlike its competitors, who boast na
tional and Olympic towers, the Cardinal
men are all walk-ons. All members on the
team have experienced a difficult learn
ing process while becoming accustomed
to the rigors of collegiate crew.
In his first year with Stanford, head
coach Craig Amerkhanian has also had to

adjust to his new rowers.
"It has been a year of infrastructure
.ind learning," Ainerkhanian said.
With .i physically demanding training
schedule that prepares the rowers for
their (all and winter races before the big
ger spring season, crew is mentally drain
ing. But, even though many are new to
the sport, this vcai's team is defined by
hard work and a dedication that should
help it build for the future.
"We're a better-shaped team than
we've been in years," said junior team
leader Nathan Schuett.
The Cardinal is hoping that its dili
gence will garner some positive results as
it heads into the final stretch of this season
at the Pac-10 Championships, which take
place on May 13 in Sacramento, and the
IRA National Championships, which
take place on May 31 in Cherry Hill, N.J.
Men's crew is not yet an NCAA sport
because it is still relatively small. The IRA
National Championship, therefore, is
akin to the NCAAChampionshipbecau.se
its winner will achieve the highest honor
awarded in collegiate crew.
Stanford hopes fora third-place finish
in Pac-lOs and a top-15 finish at the IRAs.
The team is especially anxious to try and
avenge its prior loss to Oregon State, its
biggest rival in Pac-10 action.
Sophomore Bryant Helvev said that

I he team's goals art* geared toward the lu
tureaud the('.animalbe<oinini; ,i nation
ally respected team.
Stanford is certainh on it> w.iv, .is .ill
hut one of us rowers will return next year.
In addition, next year's team will iih lude
Amerkhanian's liisi ( hiss of recruits. The
< ompletion of the Morrison lioalhouse in
time ioi next season will also |>la\ an im
portant part in the continuing growth oi
the team.
"(letting our numbers up is kev," said
sophomore Stuart Seollav.
S< huett said he feels confident that the
continued improvement of the team will
show results once it has a couple more
races under its belt.
I lie (Cardinal can also look to its novice
boats for experience as the program ex
pands «md brings more rowers who can
compete at various levels of competition.
With the last two — and admittedly
biggest — races of the season left, the
Cardinal is looking to go as fast as it can
with the resources it has.
"This first year was just year one of a
process," Amet khanian said.
As it builds on this year's experiences,
the team is anxious to see improved fin
ishes from all of its hard work.
"I'm glad that we're a young team, and
I'm excited about where we're going,"
Helvev said.
