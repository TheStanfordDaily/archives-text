## 
### NICK GEBALLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
fliev will have no Stanford Band members to
ridicule the Bears, no Axe (Committee to whip up
Cardinal spirit and no huge crowds wearing
"Who's Your Daddy?" I -shins to wildly ( beer
them on. But the three members of the Stanford
debate team who will face I'C-Berkeley s team in
tonight's "(ircat Debate," the intellectual equiva
lent of Big (lame, are ready for verbal combat.
Sophomore Jennv Herbert and juniors Amer
Ahmed and |<>n Dunn have spent the past month
intensively researt hing and preparing the argu
ments that thev hope will bring Stanford victory
for the second year in a row.
Ahmed and Dunn have participated in the
Great Debate for the past two years, but this is
I let bel t's first year.
The Great Debate, which will be held .it the
Commonwealth Club of California in San I ran
cisco at () p.m., is both an old tradition and .1 new
one. It began 111 1891, but perished 30 years ago
when I C-Berkeley s debate program withered
as a result of drastic ( uts 111 its univci sit\ funding.
But, three yeai s ago, a group of I C-Berkelcv de
bating alumni, frustrated with watching their
alma mater's debaters struggle without a coach,
revived the contest with a new format as .1 way to
raise money.
I '('.-Berkeley's team this year poses a formida
ble challenge for Stanford. One of its members,
freshman Dan Shalmon, recently won the
Copeland Award, an honor that goes to the top

rated debate partnership in the country.
Herbert praised this accomplishment, saving
it is incredible that her rival won su< ha presti
gious award as a freshman.
I'he debate will focus 011 the resolution: "Gov
ernment com erns over privac\ should not inter
fere with te< hnologi( al development and innova
tion." I ('.-Berkeley, who chose the resolution,
will argue for that position.
Herbert s.ivs her team will focus 011 the issues
of Internet technology and genetic tec hnology,
arguing that there is .1 need foi some regulation
in these areas. 1 he team expects I ('.-Berkeley's
team to make economic arguments lot letting
tec luiological innovation t.ike its < ourse, but the
Stanford team plans to counter these with evi
dence that promoting privac \ protec lion will ad
vance e-commerce lather than inhibit it.
I'lie debate's unique format gives each team,
starting with UC-Berkeley's, .1 three-minute
opening statement followed by alternating five
minutes speeches and three-minute < losing state
ments. Between speeches, there will be- one
minute cross-examination periods in which the
teams will fire questions at each other.
Then, three CC-Bet kelev-selec led judges —
a former state senator, a local broadcaster and <1
law professor who is a UC -Berkeley graduate —
will decide the winner.
Sophomore Jeff Davidson, a Stanford debater
who is not on the Great Debate team, argued that
the judges are "generally not fair," though he
