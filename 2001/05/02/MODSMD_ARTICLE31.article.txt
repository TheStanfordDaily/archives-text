CINCINNATI (AP) — A thick,
jeweleell ross swung from the gold
(li.iin around Deion Sanders'
neck. I he fingers of black batting
gloves poked from the back left
poe ket of his pinstriped (Cincinnati
Reds pants.
Mingling religion and baseball,
the tvvo-s|x )it athlete returned to the
major leagues I uesday with one
thing in mind: showing he Ix-longed.
Alter only two at-bats, he had
made his point.
Sanders lined a single to center
on the tii st pitch lie saw from Los
Angeles' Creg Cagne in the first
inning. Sanders got .1 standing
ovation and .1 curtain (all in the
second inning, when he again hit
(iagne's first pile li fin a three-run
Ik nner.
In all, Sanders went S-for-'i
and had .1 s.icrilice hum that set
up the go-ahead run 111 the Reds'
7-0 victory.

whose ( (nitr.u I with the Redskins
allows him to pla\ baseball. " I here

When he asked general tnanag
et 11111 Bowden li>r one more
chancc ovci the winter, Bowden
lelented. Sanders got .1 minor
league contract, an invitation to
spring training and .111 opportuni
t\ 111.11 tin ned out better than any

one expected.
Sanders was leading the Inter
national League in hitting with a
.459 average when the- Reels called
him up from I riple-A Louisville
011 Tuesday — the first day the
Reds were allowed to, under base
ball's rules. He was in the starting
lineup, batting second and plaving
left field.
"I feel like I earned my way
back," Sanders said. "It was not
just given, and that was very im
pot taut to me."
He gave no hints about how
long he'll stay.
When Sanders was with the
Reds in 1997, he left to go plav
football foi Dallas 111 September.
After one month in the minoi s last
\car, he decided to go back home
to Dallas and later refused a (all
up, saving he wanted to concen
trate on football.
Phis time?
"We signed Deion with the- ex
pectations that il he made tlu- big
league club, that he'd be here
throughout and help us win until
the last out is made in our season,"
said Bowden, standing behind the
batting cage.
Sanders wouldn't go cjuite that
far. Three times, he was asked how
long he'd stav with the Reds. I luce
times, he dodged the question.
"I haven't even made a commit
ment to the realtor." lie said, grin
ning. "You know what? I'm going
to be happy, man. That's liist and
foremost — that I am happy and I
am at peace in whatever decision 1
make."
The onlv time that Ins voice
took 011 an edge during two
rounds of interviews was when
someone asked whether he felt an
obligation to the Redskins.
"It's like asking if t liev feel oblig
ations to me," he said. "Pose that
question to them."
I lie Reds have a minimal obliga
tion to Sanders. Shot tl\ aftet he ar
rived in the < lubhousc at noontime
to start unpacking, lie went up to
Bowden s oflie c to sign a $500,000,
one-vcar contract that contains no
incentives or options for future

vcars, ac ( ore ling to Bowden.
Sanders posted a verse from one
ol the Psalms above his lo( ker and
added a "|csus Loves You" banner
below his nanieplate. Sanders had a
change ol heart about religion
w hen he was with the Reels in 1997,
his last in the majors.
A.!!('»() carcci hittei who never
reached base often enough to use
his speed, Sanders seemed to
chaniie his hittinir approach din

ing his ID-game stint in Louisville.
I It- led the International 1 .eague in
hitting, triples, on-base percentage
.ind slugging percentage.
"1 don't think I in a different
hallplaver," Sanders said. "I'm a
different person."
With Ken (iritfey |r. disabled bv
a torn hamstring, Sanders will get
a ( hance to plav often. Manager
bob Boone uses Ins bench a lot and
likes Sanders' speed.
