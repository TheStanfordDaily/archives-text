couldn't get much better? W ell, times have
c hanged, and the standards keep getting
pushed higher.
NVIDIA is the current leader in the 3-D
graphics industrv. Co-founded in 1993 bv

almost total dominant e of its field. 1 lowev

sition. .ind the road has been far from
straight. I lie companv has facet I mam
hurdles — nearlv going out of business
multiple times — but the dedication and
commitment of its leadership has steered
the companv through its hard times.
I his dedicatitui is apparent in the ston
of Huang, chief executive offiter of
nVIDIA. Huang earned Ins hat helor's in
electrical engineering from Oregon State.
I pon graduating in 1983, I luang moved to
Silicon Vallev to work foi \dvanced Micro
Devices, one of the hottest startups at the
time. llii.iii<j s.ikl he was diawn to Silicon

Vallev because of the huge growth oppor
tunities the area and the company offered.
I luang knew he wanted to attend Stan
ford before he moved to Silicon Valley, and
while wot king at AMD. he

heard about a cooperative
program at Stanford that
would allow him to pursue a
master's degree while work
ing full time. I luang enrolled
in the progi am and after over
six wars completed his mas
ters degree in electrical engi
neering from Stanford.
I luang decided to leave
AMD to join an innovative en
gineering companv called LSI
Logic. While there, he got Ins
first t.iste of business after mov
ing into the sales department.
"Moving from engineer-

ing into sales was one ol the
Iks) career choices I have ever made,"
I luang said.
1 he time in sales also gave I luang the
skills necessarv t<> start his own compam
.Hid succeed. In addition, the contacts he
developed at LSI were essential when

he was starting nVIDIA.
"I learned about product definition and
design, marketing, and getting the deal
done." Huang said. "I learned that cus-

tenners don't c are about a business s( hool
education, just about how our product is
going to be beneficial to them.
toward the end ot 1992, I luang and
two of his customers from Sun Microsys

three founders of the compa

graphic s as one of the markets
with greatest potential. Ihe
trio, however, might have had
too much foresight because
the industrv did not lake oil
until a few vears after nVIDIA
was founded. I his tat t, com

However, (hiring these

said. "When von are in last pi, ice, von can

In addition, nVIDIA has developed a

computer images that are entirely indistin

"'l'he future is so much better than

the beginning," I luang said.
