patience, 11 u \ have buili solar
powered cars i ri .icing
()n April 22, the group held
an open house displaying iwo ol
its solar-powered cars. 1 hesecars
will be rac ing from (Chicago to
Los Angeles in this summer's
American Solar Challenge. 11 ill
be the first time am group entei s
with two teams in the r.u e.
l he American Solar Chal
lenge is the longest solar cat i ac e
in the world. During the race,
each car will be allowed to race
from H a.m. to 5 p.m. down Route
(>(">, stopping to camp In the side
of the road. According to race
rules, drivers will have to switch
off even three lioiu s.
Background
Since 1980, Stanford's pro
ject has built live generations of
solar c .11 s. ranging from ,i con
verted Clievv Chevette to the
late si model: the I hitd Degiee
Burner.
I util 1999. all c.us had been
'i-wheelers. but the newest one is
a l-whcclcr. All the c.ns have
been one-seatci s.
"It is re.tlh fun. Brandon
Static>icl. a seeond-vear master's
student in inc. lianic al cnirineerinj'

and a former team leader, said. "It
is alsc> the onl\ student-run under
gi actuate engineering projec I.and
u gives students the experience ol
pel Ic>i ining something huge."
Solai power relies on captur
ing energy through photo
voltaic s. l'hese act as current
sources to c barge batteries, w hie h
then power the motor. I he hall
mark of solar energy is environ
inent-friendliness: No fossil fuel
lan ning means no pollution.
Technical aspects
" I he solar c.n is essentialh a
super high-eflie ienc v electric ve
hicle wit It solar cells strapped up
on top," junior Joel Segrc, a team
leader, said.
Segrc explained that the elec
ti ic al s\ stem of the c at is c oin
posed of 800 solar cells, produc -
ing a total of around 1,000 watts.
I his is about the powei that a
hairdryer consumes.
I he elec ti ic al system .ilso con
sists of peak powei tr.u kcrs, bat
teries and the motor.
I lie peak powei trackers are
l)( to-1)( c onvei tei s that mate h
the voltage of the solai array to
the voltage ol tlu- batteries while
siuuiltaneouslv holding the solar
cells to tlieii peak powei point.
Without the trackers, the cells
would determine their own volt
age and c ui rent output, wliic h is
nc it nee essai 11\ efficient.
I he batteries are different for
each of the two cars. ()ne runs on
nickel metal hydride batteries

weighing 99 kg. fhcothei runs on
lead acid batteries weighing I a a kij.
Nickel metal hvdridc batteries
are i fancier, high-performance
battel v pack similar to cellular
phone batteries. lhe lead ac ic 1
batteries are much cheapei and
are similar to conventional c.n
batteries
Both cars use DC brushlcss
motors, l'hese electric motors are
much more efficient ' than the
regular brushed motors that arc
used in most eveivdav electric
appliances.
" l he mec lianic al sv steins of the
c.n are also somewhat innovative
in that the cai is pi imai ilv c oni
posecl of composite niatci ials snn
ilar to those usc-cI in fightei |ets oi
the space shuttle, Segrc said.
"()ur I a-pounel c ,ii boil libel
c hassis supports a lullv loaded ve
hicle that weighs just ovci 900
pounds, lhe aerodynamic she ll
ol the car is made from kcvlai
panels that we press ill-house.
Kverv thing is c ustom to our c ai.
all of it student-designed and siu
elent built," Segrc added.
I lie fluid Degree Burner,
the newer c ai, also li.is some tin
usual features. Its motor is em
bedded in the wheel, which le
ctin cs friction. Its c h.issis is
made of Kevl.ir and c arbon
frame, which provide strength
and without extra weight. In
fact, the whole car onlv we ighs
100 pounds.
