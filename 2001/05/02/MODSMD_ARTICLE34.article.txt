Images ol (haired sheep and cattle carcasses

age ot the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in
(ire.it Britain.
lint as I traveled between London, Oxford and
Wales these past lew wei ks, tin I nglisli countr \ side
vielcled little indication of tlu aggressive slaughter
polic\ the \linistn ol Agriculture, fisheries, and
11 >ocl lias implemented, nndei which ovei 2 million
animals have been slaughtered and thousands of
< arc asses are still waiting disposal.
I o in\ sm pi ise, instead ol burning p\ res, I saw
loneh green pastures liglith sprinkled with ewes
and tlieii sc anipei ing lambs, a few c at tie and horses.
I low ever, the sei ene c onntr\ side onl\ masks the
c < nil i ision and angci thai tanners, govci tin lent ol
lic ials and veterinarians across the nation I eel to
wards ,i disease that apparcnth noboch was pre
pal ed to handle.
Foot-and-mouth is a liighh infectious viral dis
ease atlec ting c attic, sheep, pigs and goats. Its first
svniptom is level. \\ 111 c 11 is followed bv the formation
of blisters on the month and tied. Sc)ine animals also
exhibit lameness, dullness, loss of appetite and re
duced milk \ield. I oot-and-month disease is rarely
fatal, and it nsnalh inns its course in two to three
weeks, after w hie h niosi animals rec ovei naturally.
I nlike mad cow disease, lutmans are not alien
ed bv consuming the meat products of animals with
Ibot-and-inouth disease. I lowever. it was reported
last I uesda\ that a slaughterman working in an
area lieavih Int bv loot-and-inouth showed the
mild svmptonisol the disease.
So wh\ lias the IÂ»1111 sh governnient enforced a
massive slaughtei polic\ to handle what basicalh
sounds like the farm animal's equivalent of a bad
c ase of the tin or a cold vii us?
I lie answer lies in economic s. Since the out
break was con tit nicd in late februarv. Britain has
been restric ted from selling livestock and meat on
the world market and c annot re-enter the market
until the nation is "disease tree." 1 he loss in export
markets and lowered procluc lion pose a huge ec o
noinic i osi to the agricultural industn, and the
govet nment dec ided that the quic kesi wa\ to erad
ic ate the disease is to impose an aggressive slaugh
tei nig polic \.
All animals on a lai in where a c ase has ai isen arc
culled within 21 hours, and .ill animals on neigh
boring farms are supposed lo be c tilled within IS
hours of the case.
I his aggressive c ulling polic \ posed the problem
of disposing of the hundreds ot thousands ot cai
casses that stalled to pile up. I he Ministry <>l Agri
culture, fisheries, and food has vacillated over
whether to burn or bury these carcasses. Burning
pvres are now the locus of concern bee ause of the
possible health risk posed to humans bv local
degradation of air quality and the release of diox
ins, a class ot compounds suspec ted as c arc inogenic.
There is also c i iticism that the pvres nia\ have pro
nioti cl the spread ot the disease b\ increasing air
borne viral particles when the- wind blows the
smoke ovei neighboring firms.
I lie option ol burving c arc asses does not look
nine h better. Landfill spat e is sc arc e. and there is al
rcadv evidence that runoff from the buried sheep

/
and pigs are contaminating the water table.
Britain now claims the disease is under control
.md tilt- nuinbei of cases diagnosed per day is on
the (let line.
But, surveying the battlefield behind us, it ap
pears that thousands ot animals were needlessly
slaughtered. While over 2 million animals have
been slaughtered, less than 1 percent of those had
the disease.
W hen Britain was last plagued by foot-and
mouth disease in 1 ( .M>7. veterinarians determined
whethei ot not animals on neighboring latins
were slaughtered In taking into consideration in
fectivit\ levels in local areas. But given the inten
sification of agriculture over the past three
de( ades and the increased movement of and size
of herds and floe ks. a strict policv of slaughtering
all animals on neighbot ing farms was applied this
time around.
I lie huge economic loss of slaughtering such a
large pen entagc of Britain's livestock will continue
to weigh hea\ il\ even il Britain does regain disease
free status in the next few months.
( ritic s (l.iim that the sti i( 1 slaughter policy may
have been motivated by political reasons. British
Prime Ministct I onv Blaii faces re-election on | une
7. and he can now claim the vic tory of eradicating
foot-and-mouth disease, though he has still publicly
questioned the wisdom of some of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food's positions.
Indeed, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries,
and Food's v.u illating stances on a number of issues
li.is infuriated farmers and diminished public satis
faction with how the outbreak was handled.
Foi example, at the outset of the disease, the
government dec ided not to vaccinate healthy ani
mals against foot-and-mouth because vaccinated
animals would be hard to distinguish from infected
animals, thus further delaying the Furopean
I nion export ban on meat and dairy products
from (ireat Britain.
But, in early April, the government suddenly
looked at va( (illations in a different light when a
huge backlog of animals awaiting slaughter and
carcasses needing disposal started to accumu
late. However, farmers feared the economic im
plications of vaccinating their livestock, and
farmers whose animals were culled needlessly
were infuriated.
Meanwhile, experts estimate that (Ireat Britain
has lost $.S() billion in business this year because of
the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. Aside from
the agricultural industry, hotels and restaurants
have taken a hard hit because of decreased
tourism. Whether or not (.reat Britain regains dis
ease-free status soon, the impact of this outbreak
will be long-lasting.
It will likely take several years to restore con
sumer confidence in British agricultural prod
ucts. Instead of Buckingham Palace and London
Bridge, travelers are probably more likely to as
sociate (iteat Britain with strange farm animal
diseases like mad cow disease and foot-and
mouth disease.
It anything, the mad cow and foot-and-mouth
outbreaks that have plagued Britain are wake-up
calls lot the country and are painful examples of
how the zealous public consumption of beef has led
to practices that can cause catastrophic threats to
pul)li( health and economic stability.
