A: I lie influen/a viiuses are a group of
viruses that have iibonucleie ac id, instead of
deoxyribonucleic acid as tlu-ii basic: genetic
in.iicii.il Here is where the problem lies:
l>\A is usually ver\ stable. When it is repli
cated, the cu/vine that docs the copying,
I)NA polymerase, has the ability to correct
au\ errors introduced to it. In a sense, it can
do .1 spcll-c hc( k on the entire reproduced
"dot uineiit."
I Ins spell-checking .il >ilit\ makes certain
ill.H aii\ errors that ina\ have occurred in
replicating die DNA .ire corrected. I liere
lore, .in\ lime .1 tell in 0111 both divides, we
(.111 be confident thai the exact same "docu
ment" ol I )\ \ is repli< ated. .uid eat h daugli
tei < ell re< eives an cxae 1 duplic ale of die orig
in.il I >\A. I he same thing is 11 ue for any or
ganism whose basic genetic material is DNA.
1 Some errors are inevitably introduced, and
ihese are the mutations thai drive evolution
and natural sclcc lion).
I nfort unaielv, main organisms have
K\ \ as then basic genetic material, and, as
slated above, inlluen/a viruses are an exam
pic I he common cold-causing viruses arc
.ilso RNA viruses. So, what's going 011 here?
Win does RNA in viruses make any differ
ence to IIS?
I liei e is no spell c liec king of the RNA doc
ument when \ 11 a I genetic inatei ial is replicat
ed. I he en/\ me that does the copying. RNA
polymerase, docs not have this ability. 1 'litis,
replicated RNA lias a much higher rale ol
mi it at ic >11 than I )\ \.
In the woist (.isc sc enaiio loi the organism
iliai is replicating its RN \, the errors may be
lethal. 111 the best c ase, the errors w<>n't lead to
atiMhing much, except the organism may
look" cliffei eiitly to the outside world.
Mere's how "looking" differently works:
When a particulai inlluen/a virus replicates
the RN \ genetic material nianv times, errors
appeal I lie individual virus among the group

that has the errors now may "look" very differ
ent from the rest of the group. This virus, how
ever, is si ill .111 influenza virus, with all of the
properties of such a virus; only, now, a new
strain of influenza virus exists.
If we become infected with this new viral
strain, our bodies have never seen ibis partic -
ular "looking" virus before. Consequently,
our immune system must start fresh to re
spond against this infection. An analogy
would be that our immune sy stem has had no
previous "practice" in responding against
ibis virus.
I'he response is therefore relatively slow .
It may take many days to mount an effec live
response. I bus, by ibis time, we may be
very, very ill. Sometimes, the influenza virus
may be deadly for the already ill. elderly and
very young.
()ne exception to all this is the polio virus.
I he RNA genome of this virus is replicated
with very high fidelity, and the virus is sup
posedly very antigenic allv stable; in other
words, the immune sy stem has an easier time
lighting the virus. There are only three polio
virus "types," which makes the job of eliminat
ing the virus much simpler. I lie fidelity of the
polio virus RNA replication is the reason that
immunization against this vuus has been so
sue cessful.
because of the "changling" c apac itv of in
fluen/a viruses, there is a woi Idwide network
that monitors all of the influen/a cases that
appear in the world. Any time tlieic appeals
to be an influen/a epidemic beginning some
where, the c ulprit virus is identified, isolated
and purified and a vaccine is prepared
against it.
Stocks of the virus are kept foi future refei -
cncc to alloyv quickcr production ol vaccine the
next time this "c hangling" appeals. I hcic .11 e
rec oids kept of the rate-of-c hange that influen
za viruses undergo to trv and help predict
when, and which kind 01. influen/a virus
"e hangling" niav appear.
