A one-celled, amoeba-like protozoan known as a radiolarian was captured in this scanning electron microscope image Radi
olarians live in the ocean, where they secrete complex, silicate exoskeleton such as the one seen here. When a radiolarian dies,
its shell sinks to the ocean floor, contributing to a mass of underwater shells known as radiolarian ooze. Eventually, the ooze is
transformed into sedimentary rock.
