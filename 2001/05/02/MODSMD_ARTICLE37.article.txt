Impressively, a stndv bv Psychology Prof.
Pamela Minden at the I niversitv of Wisconsin
at Madison suggests that humor mav even im
prove mental health. Subjects that met in a
group where humor was the final point of
treatment fared better than subjei ts who were
not exposed to the same humor. Minden sug
gests that the secret behind this treatment is
that the humorous nurses in the "humor"
group reminded patients that humor is an ef
fective coping mechanism.
Furthermore, humor has been shown to
have other psychological benefits. Making a
joke increases the self-esteem ol both the joker
and the audience members. I lie explanation
for this seems to be that "getting" a joke makes
von feel smart and useful; sharing that experi
ence with others makes you feel more con

no ted with them.
Mm 11 to m\ frustration, it is important to
note 1 1 Kit humor isn 't always appropriate.
While humor can relieve stress .uul improve
sell-esteem, joking around can also heroine
vet v distracting.
In some situations, humoi can under
mine relationships. Imagine Ivinjjon the op
erating table helore \ and your doetoi
savs, "I can cut you open all

i iglit, Inn 1 haven't quite figured
out this sewing-closed part." In
this (,ise, luunor is likely to in
< rease anxiety.
Most of the time, though,
humor is most likelv to he benefi
(lal. So how do vou put it to use?
Research from the International
|ournal of Humor Research and
olhet publications highlights sev
eral wavs to maximize the useful
ness of humor.
()ne is to use humor in areas
where a person has low self-confi
dence. This makes sense given

that humor i .uses self-esteem. For example, to
ease tension in the audiein e, a statist its profes
soi might want to in.ike a joke before gi\ ing a
let lure to a room lull of psychology majors.
Another pic< e of ad\ ice is to use humor be
fore an anxictv-provoking experience. I 'his
follows from two pieces of research, l irst, we
know that humoi will increase positive emo
tions, reciprocally inhibiting the negative
ones. Second, humor is a good wav to cope
with anxiet\ — making a joke In-fore becom
ing anxious serves to remind you of that. A
good example of this use of humor would be
to watch the "South Park" movie before a final.
Finally, don't use stock jokes. Much of the
emotional and mental reward in humor is
based on spontaneity. It's not nearly as chal
lenging to make or get a joke vou've already
heard; your ability to comprehend new male
rial is what makes your self-esteem go up when
you gel a joke.
So if you find yourself under extreme pres
sure during the midterm season, gel out and
< rat k .1 joke! Don't worry if you're really bad .it
it; so long as you're with other people, some
one will definitely laugh at von.

where a person has low self-confi

that humor i .uses self-esteem. For example, to
ease tension in the audiein e, a statist its profes

Another pic< e of ad\ ice is to use humor be

know that humoi will increase positive emo
tions, reciprocally inhibiting the negative
ones. Second, humor is a good wav to cope
with anxiet\ — making a joke In-fore becom
ing anxious serves to remind you of that. A
good example of this use of humor would be
to watch the "South Park" movie before a final.
Finally, don't use stock jokes. Much of the
emotional and mental reward in humor is
based on spontaneity. It's not nearly as chal
lenging to make or get a joke vou've already
heard; your ability to comprehend new male
rial is what makes your self-esteem go up when
you gel a joke.
