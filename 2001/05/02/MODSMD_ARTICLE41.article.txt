I licsc findings are baffling be
cause blue light reaches the fur
thest depths in the ocean, so it
would certainly be in the animals'
interest to be able to detec 1 light of
that frequency*, (lone tells detect

and river otters, and also 111 the
hippopotamus, .111 animal related
to whales.
Researchers believe that whales
and seals lost theii color x ision after
they split oil from a common an

turned to the sea. Ihe lull arm le
