"No one would say that once we get rid of this reser

that are hard to check or lie beyond the reach of AIDS
drugs, siu h as the brain, bone marrow and testes.
" It will be .i daunting task to eliminate those un

drugs that might come out in the near future," says Dr.

I his is why C.hun and many AIDS researchers now

the body's own.
I hese doctors would like to teach the immune s\stem
to control 111Y, so people can stop taking AIDS di ugs,

Noonei an sav wliether this is even possible. But they
alread\ (an envision a strategy: Shut down viral replica

boosters that will intensify the body's natural — and up
to now , failed — surveillance against 111 Y.
In lime, thev say, the immune system might learn
to do the entire job alone. But all of this is unproven

(Al*) — Will A11)S ever be < medr
Ihe latest research on ihe resourceful lll\

heartening answer: Probably not.
|list a lew years ago, even some of the most
sober-minded resean hers wondei ed it the end
of AIDS might lie near. Perhaps the pills 11i.ii
miraculously changed 11IV from a death sen
tence to a < lnoni< infection would go the final
step, thev thought, eventually «uring the inlet -
tion by purging everv trace oft he virus from t In
human body.
Sim h talk (|iii( kl\ laded. I he new drug < < »< k

the virus. Kven if all signs of it vanished foi
years, HIV was siill lurking somewhere. In

people stopped taking their nictlii 11 u s.
Kver since that realization sank in, finding
111 V's hiding places has been t he goal < >1 asm.ill
group of resean hers. What the\ have learned
is one of the biggest disappointments in \11)S
research.
The fact that lIIV is an insidious and re
sourceful parasite is hardly a sin pi isr. Alici all,
Al 1 )S resean hers alrea<l\ understand in lavish
