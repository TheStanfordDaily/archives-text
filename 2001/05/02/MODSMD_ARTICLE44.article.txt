# Chickens not just a tasty treat; some even square-dance

WRAY, Colo. (AP) â€” Fifteen min
utes before da\ break vou'll hear them.
Low, reedy moans that float up the
gulch like phantoms on the wind.
To see them vou'll have to wait. And
wait. And wait some more.
You must luukli behind a camou
flaged tarp with a do/en bug-eyed bird
watchers at an hour so ungodly, even
the farmer down the road hasn't vet
stirred.
Afraid to so ninth as wipe vour
nose, lest von spook them, von are
dressed preposterously in a ski outfit
to avoid frostbite, 300 miles from the
nearest downhill run.
All this for dancing chickens?
"Don't move," hisses birder Bob
McC.readv of the Nature Conservan
cy. "| list wait. It'll be awesome."
1 his could take hours. It it happens
,ii .ill
1 he (it eater Prairie ('.hicken, once
a staple on sodbusters' rotisseries, is
nearlv extinct in most of its Creat
Plains range 112 rom (Canada to Mexico.
1 he few survivors are vanishing be
neath the blades of combines and bull
dozers. Disappearing with them is
their mesmerizing courtship dance
that entices otherwise normal people
to become sunrise voyeurs fora few
( hilly weeks a vear.
One hundred springs ago, the
grasslands boiled with millions of
prairie chickens in heat. Hunting
thinned their flocks before World
War I.
The prairie chicken's dismal fate is
shared bv most of its winged neigh
bors. A stud\ bv biologist Fritz Knopf
of the I .S. Ccological Survev shows
that grassland birds are experiencing
a steeper and more widespread de
dine than .inv other group of verte
brate animals in North Anient a.
I he nation's breadbasket is home
to ,'WO bird species. I he populations
ol 70 percent are dwindling, Knopf
reports.
In particular, conservationists
worry about a baker's do/en of
grassland nesters they've dubbed
the "Unlucky l.'L" I lie prairie

chicken tops that list. Surveys show
it is declining by 7 percent annually;
some states have just a few hundred
remaining.
"'Flie greater prairie chicken is a
signature species of the prairie, as vital
to defining the landscape as bison,"
said essayist Christopher Cokinos, for
mer president of the Kansas Audubon
(Council.
I fere they tome up the hill, finally.
Five . . . six . . . now seven roosters
gather in a ragged circle.
Related to grouse but plumper,
thev are weirdly resplendent in tapes
of white and brown striped feathers.
Long, sharp tufts point behind their
bobbing heads like a chieftain's war
bonnet. 1 heir beady eyes are shroud
ed bv fleshy yellow tombs.
('.hit kens gone punk.
In unison thev drop their beaks,
stomp the ground, fan their tails and
Map their wings in a ritual that is part
slam-dance, part square-dance.
Here comes the best part. I lie
h( HHiiing.
I he bovs inflate orange air sacs
known as tympani in their throats.
I hey resemble tangerines tucked be
neath their thins. When they exhale,
the\ emit a noise sounding like a child
blowing into au empty soda bottle.
Whut-ru-rrr. Whoom-ah-oom.
Who( >-doo.
I )i ives the hens wild.
()n cue, three drab females emerge
demurely from behind yucca t lumps.
I he boys turn serious. They jump
straight into the ail. bump hreast.s and
light in bursts of leathers. I liev fill the
dawn with (ackles ant I hoots.
Some anthropologists believe
Plains Indians niimit ketl booming in
their ceremonial tlant es. ()thers joke
it inspired end zone celebrations in
!< i< itball.
I lie liens will mate with the males
who win then skirmishes and defend
the biggest territory.
"It's like nature's barn dance,"
whispei s (.In is Pague, (Colorado st ien
tilit director of the Nature (Conservan
cy. " I he best dancer wins."

What's calling the tune at this hoe
down?
"Testosterone," Pague chuckles.
Booming means spring has arrived
tin the prairie. It will entl in May in
central stales like Colorado and Mis
souri. Farther north in Wisconsin and
Minnesota, it might last until early
| une.
Prairie chickens don't migrate.
1 heir short wings enable them to ex
plode from the grass and wiltlflowers.
but thev rarely llv higher than a cot
tonwood tree or farther than the next
gulch.
l'hev always return to the same
breeding ground, or lek. I nless their
ancestral love stage has been turned
into a wheat field or a subdivision.
1 his lek is the fl.it top ola sandhill
on the Fox Ranch near Wray. It's 150
miles northeast ol Denver, past the
hamlets of Last Chance, Cope and
|oes. Kansas begins a few miles over
Mc(Creadv's shoulder.
The Nature Conservancy pur
chased the 14,000-acre parcel iu
1998. It carefully tuns cattle and hors
es to approximate the gi azing benefits
that evolved over thousands of vears
until the IBf>os, when the region's last
great bison herd lolled in these lush
meadows.
"It's the best known example we
have left of a tallgrass-plains cotton
wood strcamside community," Pague
said.
It's a last perch for grassland birds,
too. In addition to the greater prairie
chicken, the ranch is a refuge to five
other species among the I nlut ky l!i,
including the lai k bunting ((Colorado's
st.ite bird), Cassin's sparrow, long
billed ( in lew , ferruginous hawk and
burrow ing owl.
The Conservancy is working
throughout the Creat Plains to protect
the birds' habitats. But tourists might
be the prairie chicken's savior.
Bird-watching has become the sort
of upscale obsession, like llarley
Davidson rallies and history re-enact
ments, that can provide life-sustaining
cash infusions to withering farm

towns.
According lo the U.S. Fish &
Wildlife* Sen u e, lilt million Americans
spend $20 billion annually on bincx u
lars, bird feed, water warmers and va
cations io sanctuaries.
In I,(K'kwckkl. Mo., a ranc her turns
his bunkhousc into a bed-and-breafast
for birders every spring. Kagle l-ike,
I cxas, holds a chili cook-off. (They
don't eat the guest of honor.)
Rothsav, Minn., erected a 9,000-
pound statue of a prairie chicken.
It is one of the Midwest's most
photographed roadside oddities,
right up there with the 17,400-
pound ball ol siring in neighbor
ing Darwin.
Wrav hosts booming tours in a trail
er on private land, finders from as far
awa\ as Europe book their lekside
seats .i vear in advance.
When Chamber of (Commerce
president kateri Reeves was hired five
ve.ii s ago. one of her first meetings was
held .it sunrise in the trailer. She goi
the point.
"We have the utmost respect for
the birds and their land," she said.
"Imagine what tlie pioneers in their
wagon trains must've thought when
thev heard this booming. It must
have been a real eye-opener."
Literally.
Daybreak on ihe prairie can be gor
geous this time of vear. A fat, cold sun
hovers on the horizon. Frost sparkles
on clumps of blue grama grass and the
first buds of white evening primrose.
But not ibis morning. Slate gray
clouds scrape the sandhills, spreading
gloom.
Flic prairie c hie kens' ardor cools.
After 45 minutes, the bovs stop strut
ting and start pec king in the gravel.
As iheir air sacs collapse, they
squeeze out their last few wheezy
notes. Ii sounds like end of a bagpipe
lesson.
"Awesome," says M(( .ready, bol
stering bis binoculars.
On cue, the prairie chickens turn
tail and fly down the gulch. And into
an unlucky future.
