Yes, we really did want you to see the ad. (So, no, we did not blur it out on purpose.)
Because of an error by our off-site printer, David Horowitz's advertisement in yesterday's Daily was illegible,
so we are running the entire Opinions project again. Keep your fingers crossed for us as you turn the page!
Please see pages 6 and 7 for David Horowitz's ad and the BSU s response.
