IN A I FW SI I () R I days, I lie future of the
I (x)i I tills in.in he (let ick'd, and I he Santa
Clara Board ol Supervisors s upcoming
vote over whcthei lo allow tin- (larnegie
lot nidation to huild in ihe hills could set an un
welcome precedent. I lie Carnegie Founda
tion is .in important institution lor teaching
and researching, hut the I Diversity lias not
made .i strong enough ellort to listen to the
concerns ol coinmunitv meinhers and envi
ronmentalists who oppose the building. I he
( nivei sit v t am lot af lord to lose this institution,
hut it miist m.ike more serious concessions and
improve its communication with meinhers ol
(lie Stanford com i nil i lit \ to make the final dc
(isi< >11 — w hatevei it is — one I li.it everyone can
live with.
I lie Carnegie Foundation, a think tank lot
research in teaching, applied lo erect ;i new
21 ,<MM)-fool nest in the Foothills in l ( .)9<S. Since

then, the University hasbareh blinked. Instead,
it hass.it hack and watched while the foundation
proposed its plan and, again, remained uncom
fortably acquiescent when the Board of Super
visors recently asked the foundation to revise its
plan to address certain environmental con
cerns. I he approval of this plan has been de
layed several times this veai bee auseof environ
mental concerns from the board, so one group
clearly needs to give a little on this issue. Stan
ford has both the powei and the <ihilit\ to .liter
its demands, and it should re-evaluate its (ur
rent plan lor this reason.
In the past, I he Daily 11.is fallen on both sides
of certain aspec tsol the land use issue, but it tame
to our attention that, while there are no staled
plans for the I niversih to build in the Foothills
bevond the Carnegie building, this action does
provide a window for future development. Based
on p.ist experience with development in the lulls

and the use of the land, few people in the sur
rounding community trust the I Diversity's
promise that no further development is planned
or will take place. Stanford should use this op
portunitx to make true concessions and restore
the community's liiith in the good intentions of
the I niversitv's land use plans.
While Stanford maintains one of the most
renttwned teaching and education programs in
the world, and the Carnegie Foundation cer
tainly adds to that brilliant program, the ( ni
versit\ did not attempt to keep the foundation
on the existing campus lands. Instead, it of
fered a spot in the previously undeveloped
Foothills. I he foundation responded with a
plan that calls for developing on a prcvioush
open portion of the foothills, damaging the
land I.ir more than the ambient hikers and
walkers the I niversit\ had originally been
guarding against eve r could. But the Universi

ty's worry over land damage appears to have
waned since the fall. I lie I niversity has backed
the foundation's plan to erect its large head
quarters, including a long, paved access road
that would arch across the hills like a lacerated
scar. Clearly, more subtlety may be at work
here, which is disturbing on both an environ
mental and community relations level. The fact
that this doubt can even exist speaks to the need
for more transparency in the way the I niversi
ty handles land use.
In the end, it is not so much that either
group is in the wrong on this issue, but rather
that both must look lor ways to compromise. If
Stanford gives some ground, it w ill prove to the
community that this issue c an be resolved ami
ably. When the community sees that Stanford
means well, then it can work with Stanford and
other groups — such as environmentalists —
to come to some much needed closure.
