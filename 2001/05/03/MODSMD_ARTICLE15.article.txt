Carnegie building won't ruin
beauty of Foothills
Stanford is a nrc.it universit\ with
two ni.ijoi missions: educ .ition .iiml ic -
search. I he Carnegie foundation for
the Scholarship of I Vac liing h.is the
same missions. Stanford of 1 if red it .1 site
adjacent to the C.entei tot Behavioral
Sc ienees in the hills above the Dish trail.
I lie appropriateness of Carnegie's
present!' there is obvious, and .id\.in
takes from its interactions with the be
havioral sciences and teachers in the re
gion are promising. I .ocal teat hers sup
pot tit.
()pposition conies from a group that
raises etivironnient.il issues. I licsc is
sues are important, too, and must be
faced in this rapidly (hanging world
where both open space and our ability
to educate the next generation are
threatened In population growth. So,
with the question of permitting
Carnegie to build on the offered site,
one must c boose between the greater of
two goods, not between the lesser of two
evils. If ever a situation c alled for ratio
nal and sensitive compromise, this is it.
But opponents have raised questions
about Stanford's motives in offering the
site, and these opponents supply sinis
ter answers. A Palo Alto resident in the
April 27 edition of the*Palo Alto Daily
News characterizes the compromises

( arncgic offers as a "glitzy public rela
tions campaign to "fool" the County
Supervisors into "accepting an urban
scale development." A Palo Alto Daily
News headline 011 April 25 read
"Carnegie tweaks plans to get building
past countv supervisors."
1 low do these people know what mo
tivates Stanford and Carnegie? I have
hiked the Stanford lands ovet 25 years
and I know the site s location and re
centlv visited it. With binoculars, vou
can see it from the southern edge of the
Dish trail by foc using below the shinv
dome of the student observatorv on the
north edge. You c an only sec- one of the
abandoned trailers that will be hauled
away if Carnegie's permit is approved.
I he adjacent Behavioral Sc ienc e Cen
ter cannot be seen, but can be visited by
following signs on the I.inks Road off
|unipcro Scrra.
I lie c enter is a group of small studios
for research scholars, a librarv, confer
ence room, lunch cafeteria and st.iff
support offices. An article in the April 25
issue of the Palo Alto Weekly claims
tli.it, if the ('.arncgie site is approved, of
fice buildings will cover the lulls, and the
beauty of our region will lie "lost forev
er." The writer refers to photos on a
Web site purporting to show the beauty
that would be lost forever, but these are
views taken from the site, not of the it.
Those views will still be there. Mean

while, the rhetoric is ugly.

Development in Foothills
a 'huge mistake'
Do we really want our childrens'
teachers to encourage sprawling, na
ture-destroying development? Putting
the Carnegie Foundation in the
Foothills would do just that. If there
was one thing that I would have
thought the Carnegie Foundation had
learned by now through all its years of
research is the fact that what is being
taught is just one aspect of what makes
up .m education.
I lie presentation of the materials, the
classroom environment and parental
support are just some of" the other sig
nificant factors. I low can we truly teach
our children to respect the natural
world .uid learn to live sustainably with
it if the institutions devoted to helping
our children are directly contributing to
the paving of the planet? Please let the
Board of Supervisors know that you
truly support the education of our chil
dren and that allowing Carnegie in the
Foothills is a huge mistake.
