TODAY'S OPINIONS SKC HON
contains two guest columns
that we .it The Daily very
much want vou to see: Day id
Horowitz's piece, titled "Ten Reasons
Why Reparations lor Slavery is .1 Bad
Idea — and Racist I <>o" (page .\<"»), and
.1 response from Stanford's Black Stu
dent I Hion, titled "Ten Reasons Win
You Shouldn't Be Fooled In David
Horowitz's Ad — and Win It's Racist
loo" (page A7). We encourage vou to
give these columns c arelul attention and
to use them as a h.isis lot learning more
about one of this year's most talkccl
about issues 011 c ollege campuses.
But win is I lie Daily running these
pieces now? I o some extent, we felt left
out because we did not receive the ad
vertisement until long aftet main othet
college newspapers had. 1 hough we
could not be sure win we had not been

ottered the advertisement, our best
guesses .ill led iis to believe that, .it least in
the eves ol Horowitz and Ins associates,
Stanford was not the kind of c ampus that
would lead 111.111\ visible l.ishion — with
protests and sit-ins, as other campuses
had — so it w.ts not even worth trying to
provoke a response.
We, as a newspaper, believe in dia
logue. so we were naturally saddened bv
the implication tli.it Stanford's student
bod\ was not perceived .is a group pas
sionate 01 informed enough to organize
around an issue so mam other college
students had (leai Iv taken to heart.
I 11 us. when we linalK did receive the
advertisement and, consequently. began
thinking about the related questions
again, we s.iu .111 invaluable opportunity
to promote conversation, dispel some
mvths about Stanford and.in the pro

At the suggestion of one former
Daily staffer, and after conversations
with community members from the
lilac k (Community Sen it es ( cntci and
ilic Communication Department,
among others, we decided to run
Horowitz's advertisement as a guest
column, alongside a response column
from the Mack Student I nion, in the

TODAY'S OPINIONS SKC HON
contains two guest columns
that we .it The Daily very
much want vou to see: Day id
Horowitz's piece, titled "Ten Reasons
Why Reparations lor Slavery is .1 Bad
Idea — and Racist I <>o" (page .\<"»), and
.1 response from Stanford's Black Stu
dent I Hion, titled "Ten Reasons Win
You Shouldn't Be Fooled In David
Horowitz's Ad — and Win It's Racist
loo" (page A7). We encourage vou to
give these columns c arelul attention and
to use them as a h.isis lot learning more
about one of this year's most talkccl
about issues 011 c ollege campuses.
But win is I lie Daily running these
pieces now? I o some extent, we felt left
out because we did not receive the ad
vertisement until long aftet main othet
college newspapers had. 1 hough we
could not be sure win we had not been

ottered the advertisement, our best
guesses .ill led iis to believe that, .it least in
the eves ol Horowitz and Ins associates,
Stanford was not the kind of c ampus that
would lead 111.111\ visible l.ishion — with
protests and sit-ins, as other campuses
had — so it w.ts not even worth trying to
provoke a response.
We, as a newspaper, believe in dia
logue. so we were naturally saddened bv
the implication tli.it Stanford's student
bod\ was not perceived .is a group pas
sionate 01 informed enough to organize
around an issue so mam other college
students had (leai Iv taken to heart.
I 11 us. when we linalK did receive the
advertisement and, consequently. began
thinking about the related questions
again, we s.iu .111 invaluable opportunity
to promote conversation, dispel some
mvths about Stanford and.in the pro
cess, lostei a great et sense of 'community.

At the suggestion of one former
Daily staffer, and after conversations
with community members from the
lilac k (Community Sen it es ( cntci and
ilic Communication Department,
among others, we decided to run
Horowitz's advertisement as a guest
column, alongside a response column
from the Mack Student I nion, in the
()pinions section of I he Dailv.
\\ e hoped then, as we do now, that this
decision would prove lx>ih to our 11111111111-
nit\ and to people at loss the couutn that
serious issues can he discussed in a con
st niciive wa\ and, 11101 e linpoitanth. that

In the time since we received the ad
vertisement, one development lias trou

foi<l Review to inn I lorowit/'s piece with

the headline, "The Ad I lie Daily Didn't
Want You I o See," on the front page of
the publication on \dmii Weekend
seemed to us a deliberate at I ainieclat un
dermining our i redihility with assertions
of, at best, questionable lac tual basis.
I hough some would argue tli.il the
use of the- word "ad" in the hcadlinc
inacle the statement true- because
1 lie D.iilv did in fact reject the ad.
choosing instead to run the content .is
