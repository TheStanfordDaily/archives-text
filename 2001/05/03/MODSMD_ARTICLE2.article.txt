## Gift to University the largest in history of higher education 
### NADIRA HIRA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation will make a gift of $400
million in unrestricted funds to Stan
lord, Hewlett Foundation ('.hair
man Walter B. Hewlett announced
yesterday at noon in the Quad. S.'iOO
million of the donation will be direct
ed to the School of 1 lumanities and
Sciences, and the remainder is ear
marked for the Campaign for Un
dergraduate Education.
According to Provost John
Etcheincndy, this is one of the largest
gifts ever given to an institution of
higher educati< >11 and the largest gift to

an endowment, to
the knowledge of
I 'diversity officials.
Some 250 fac
ulty, stall and stu
dents, who were
invited via e-mail
to witness the "un
p recede n t ed
historical an

nouncement," were on hand this
.ilternoon to hear Walter Hewlett,
Hewlett Foundation President
Paul Brest, University President
John Hennessy, Ktchemendy and
other University officials announce
and comment on the donation.
"This gift is .i tribute to my fa
ther," Walter Hewlett said, refer
ring to the late William Hewlett,
who established the Hewlett Foun
dation. "It honors Ins lifetime of
philanthropy, his lifelong devotion
to Stanford and his passionate be
lief in the value of a liberal arts ed
ucation. I lad lie lived, I am certain
this is something he would have
done himself."
The donation
I lie Hewlett Foundation's gift
to Stanford is the largest gift ever to
one American university and may
be the largest in the world, Scott
|aschik, editor of the Chronicle of
I liglier Education, told the Associ
ated Press yesterday. A $!W0 mil

lion donation to Rensselaer Poly
technic Institute in Troy, N.Y., was
the previous record.
1 his donation is 20 times larger
than any other gilt given by the
Hewlett Foundation. The unre
stricted nature of the donation al
lows the University to utilize the
funds where they are needed.
Hewlett Foundation Director
James C. Gait her called the dona
tion a "bold visionary step."
"We hope, too, that this gift will
encourage others in the philan
thropic world — individuals as well
as foundations — to think boldly
about making major commitments
to the universities and other insti
tutions that are important to our
future," (laither said.
According to Ktchemendy, the
University aims to get matching do
nations tor this gift. For example, in
order to endow a chair, a potential
donor would only have to con
tribute half the normal amount,
and the rest of the funds would
come from the foundation's gift.
I he donation is written using the
term "challenge" to encourage the
University and potential contribu
tors to broaden the reach of the gift
through such methods as matching
donations, Ktchemendy said.
"This will provide a huge
amount <>i motivation to faculty to
go out and do more, Ktchemendy
said, commenting on a (all from
Brest for faculty tos|xnd 10 hours a
-year out encouraging philanthropy
"to ensure the future of the school."
The University's needs
A member of the Humanities
and Sciences Council, an advisory
group, Walter Hewlett became
aware of the serious financial needs
of the school over four years ago,
according to Ktchemendy.
"What Stanford needs most,
frankly, is donor support lot very
flexible use," Ktchemendv said. Be
cause many donations to the Uni
versity are targeted to specific areas
or programs, University officials
are often unable to address the
University's most pressing needs,
despite receiving large gifts.
"This will affect every part ofthe
University," Ktc hemendy said. "An
unrestricted endowment provides

continued support for needs at the
base level."
The situation: H&S
fhe majority of the gift, $'t()0
million, will go to the S< hool of I lu
manities and Sc ienc cs.
Hennessy noted that "the I Di
versity's first president, David Stan
Jordan, wanted Stanford to be a
place where 'work in applied sci
ences is to be carried out side l>\
side with the pure st iences and hu
manities.' " I le said that, after leav
ing his position as clean of the
School of Engineering n> become
provost, he was surprised by the
disparity in resources between the
applied sciences and the humani
ties and natural sciences.

"Under Dean (of the School of
I lumanitiesand S< iences Malcolm)
Beasley's leadership, we began to
understand the challenges (faced
by the school]," I lennessy said, fhe
Provost's ()flicc also began a needs
assessment of the entire I 'Diversity
that shed light on areas that were
most lac king.
"Resources are not available foi
faculty in the humanities and sci
ences," I lennessv said.
"Cost at any institution like this
one is largely salary," Etchemendy
said. "It can costa million [dollars]
just to bring a faculty member to
Stanford," he continued, < iting the
high cost of living and providing
resources, among other expenses.
Hennessy also pointed out that

only 12 percent of the University's
current endowment supplies the
School of I lumanities and Sciences.
" I he scope of the gilt allows ns
to think in terms of truly long-term
growth," said Biology Prof. Sharon
Long, who will become clean of the
School of I lumanities and Sciences
Sept. I.
I hough the School of I lumani
ties and Sciences is one of Stan
lord's largest schools, it is also the
youngest, having been organized
from a group of departments into a
whole only 50 years ago.
" I he awesome generosity of the
gift speaks for itself." Beasley said.
"What is less apparent to those on
the outside, perhaps, is the power
this gift will have in terms of

strengthening the teaching, learn
ing and research that goes on at
Stanford in disciplines that we be
lieve are at the very core of the I ni
versity's mission."
The situation: Undergraduates
I lie remaining $100 million of
the donation will go to the I niver
sity's $1 billion Campaign for Un
dergraduate Kducation. Il.ilf of
this will endow undergraduate
scholarships, and theothei half will
be applied directly to undergradu
ate education through such mea
sures as new research programs for
undergraduates.
