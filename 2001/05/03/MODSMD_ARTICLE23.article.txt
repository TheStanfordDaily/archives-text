### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
I his weekend No. I I ( .I_\. No. 2 Ilrigham
Young, No. <S ()|iio State and No. 10 IVnn State
will lacc oil in I -ong Beach for 11 it* N( AA men's
volleyball national (hampionship.
While a couple players oil the Stanford \<juad
were planning on di ivingdown t<x het k out the
matches, there is undouhtedh a sinking feeling
among .ill the players that the trip to the NCAA

tournament is one that the No. . r ) Cardinal
could have made as more than just spectators.
Hut Stanford's dream ol winning the pro
gram's second national title was ended In I CL\
on April 21 in the fust round ofthe Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation lournamcnt,
I Ik- Bruins and the ('.atdinal battled for we ll
over two hours through five games and too
main emotional turns to count, but, after six
mate h points between the two teams. I CL\ pre
vailed 20-1 Sin the fifth game to bring Stanford's

season to a heartbreaking close. I he defending
national champion Bruins went on to win the
MI'SF Tournament, earning them a berth in the
four-team N( .AA ('.hampionships.
Karly on, we knew that there were nine or
10 teams in the conference that could beat
each other, said Ruben Nieves, who wrapped
up his I Ith season as Stanford's head coach.
"When we were at full strength, we could beat
anyone, in.tin situation. I hat last match was a
tough loss because we know that we could be
where UCLA is now."
I lie loss to the Bruins capped off a roller
coaster season for the Cardinal, which fin
ished with a 14-0 record, iiu hiding a 10-7
mark in the M I\SF.
At times, Stanford looked unbeatable on
the court. At other points the (Cardinal could
struggle with just about everything. All the
while, the team fought through a seeiningh
endless string of injuries to its starters, which
forced players to shift positions and roles on
almost a game-by-ganie basis.
"We struggled with so many injuries, and
when we had everyone together we did so
well." said sophomore outside hitter Curt
1 oppel, who was named second team All-
MPSF this week. "We didn't have the oppor
tunity to plav together toward the end that
could have pushed us ahead and towards a
ii.iiiou.il championship."
When the team was healthy, there w.is no
question tli.it it was one of the best in the nation.
Hie (lardinal went 10-3 when n was able to st.u t
its top lineup.
I lie Stanford attack was overpowering
early in the season, and the ('.ardinal started
the year on a f>-0 tear, dropping onlv three
games in those first six matt lies. A month into
the season, Stanford had taken hold of the
No. I ranking and boasted ilie nation's
strongest offense with a hilling pel cent age of
over .400.
But .i sloppy 3-2 loss to I'epperdine on Feb.
13 ended the honeymoon for the Cardinal,
and what followed was a nearly two-month
stretch of injui us during which the team went
4-7 against confereiue opponents and fell to
seventh in the rankings.
During this stretch, the team lost I oppel
who finished third in the nation with f>.3. r ) kills
per game after leading the nation in kills last
year â€” for nearly a month with a groin in
jury. Stanford also went through stints with
out its two leading diggers, sophomore libero
Setli King and junior outside hitter Man ns
sk.u el.
I his team did a nice job of working hard
and improving throughout the year and in
overcoming adversity," Nieves said. " l iic
players knew how to have fun while working
toward their goals. I his was a team tli.it Stan
ford could be proud of iu the way they put in
effort and the way they represented the I Di
versity."


Sophomore Curt Topple elevates fora spike during the MPSF Tournament. Topple finished third in the
nation in kills per game this season, earning a spot on the All-Conference Second Team.
