I'm writing today to dec lare niv eligihilitx fort lie
2001 N HA Draft. It sounds so simple, doesn't it?
Vou'd think there'd be more to it — signing
something in blood, tli.it sort of thing, But the\
tell me all I've got to do is send a lettei. so here it is.

I've thought .i lot about ibis deci
sion, and I'm quite sure it's the road
1 want to go down. I he Nh.\ Draft
this year isn't until |unc 27. quite a
ways awa\. but the deadline foi e.u l\
entrants to dec lare is M.i\ I — |usi
around the corner. I figure with niv
future in the hands of the I nited
States Postal Service, I'd be better oil
sending ibis of! soonei ratliei than

later. I mean, vou saw "(lastaway." right? You know
what ( .111 happen to voiii mail.
Anyway, m\ point is that it's crunch lime, and I ve
made my dei ision. I'm well aware th.it. In dei hiring.
I'm renouncing mv four remaining years of college
eligibility, and that's a sacrifice I'm willing lo make to
test my game against the best in the world. I under
stand that I'm allowed to pull out until June 20. which
is awfullv nice of you guvs. I li.it way, if we get into
|une and stouts start telling me that the dippers
wouldn't draft me as their water boy, I can still go
back to school.
My good buddy, let 's call him Jason K. — no, that 's
too specific, let's call him J. Kapono — told me all

about that. Last vear. he ligured he'd had a pretty
ama/ing freshman veai (co-Freshman of the Year in
the I'ac -lO with some guv named dasev) and, hey,
wh\ not.'W ho among us doesn't think going for 17
points against the Washington State Kittv ('.ats isn't an
NBA-worthy accomplishment? So he tossed his hat
into the ring and went looking for the big pavoff.
I rouble was. those pic k\ scouts seem to think that,
il you can i guard Rvan Mendez, you might have
some problems with, sa\. Vince darter. On most of
the mock drafts, |.K. came out about a mid-fifth
ronndei in a two-round draft, if vou get niv drift.
hut because he hadn't signed with an agent yet,
he c ould still pull out. I low great is that? If we with
draw from < lasses a week before the final, they call
it "flunking."
I don't think I'm too worried about pulling out of
the draft, though. I'm reach for the big show.
I'll admit that my parents have their doubts. They
seem to think that it might be inappropriate of me to
be thinking about niv pro basketball career without
having played a minute of collcge basketball — or in
deed. basketball of am kind — since niv fourth-grade
(A () team. I hc\ point out the fact that I run about a
seven-second 10, that (Coach Montgomcrv could
probabh outrebound me. that I'm built less to handle

I keep telling em they've got it all wrong. 1
stayed out of college ball as a protest! Listen, as a fu
ture N'hA player, I have awesome responsibility as
a role model to America's youth! I don't want to
support the fat-cat NdAA establishment, getting
rich off the players' work and not paying em a
