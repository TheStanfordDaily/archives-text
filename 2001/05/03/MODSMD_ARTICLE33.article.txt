Blow In Ihe Wind begins, appropriately, with a
driving version ol bob Dylan's "Klowm' In I lie \\ md."
complete with car-perled harmonies and glain rock
guitai nils. Ihe allium noes on to punkilx songs like

Some i hoices, like I amim W \ nette's count r\ < lassit .
Stand B\ \ out Man, seem more challenging and in
novative than others, sll< h .is Del Shannon s "Runawav,"
w hit h St ree( lung Weasel ainph covered as a hard-core
song in I9HB.

Slawson's crooning vocals and various yelled "Yeah!"s
maintain tlie lighthearted lone throughout the allium.
I he production and sound on this record, like previous
ellorts, are definitely top-notch. And, clearly, these guys
are having fun singing a cappella harmonies and sitting
around deciding which songs to rearrange into punk
numbers.
But one can't shake the feeling that the l>asi< idea be
hind the hand's existence — being only a (over band
takes away Iroin the individual musi< ians in the sense that,
il they're going to lorm a supergroup, they could proba
bly be coming up with some great original material in
stead <>| rehashing already established radio hits. And in
today's com men iali/ed environment, the music industry
is no doubt looking to find the next novel lad to sell to the
kids, which is why it is no surprise that Me l irst is cur
rently getting commercial radio play with their Cat
Stevens (over, "Wild World."
\\ lib the recent popularity ol the "punk" sound being
marketed to the public, expect to heat more silly punk
covers of old songs by less-talented bands in the coming
\e.us. But, in the meantime, pop in "Blow In The Wind"
or am of Me I n stand the (iimmc (limmes's other records
