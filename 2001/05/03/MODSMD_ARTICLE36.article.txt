# PA musician DeMeyer: Catching an updraft
## 
### JOSEPH KUGELMASS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Much ol the Ik-si country and lolk music
being produced today never readies your
ears. (lifted songwriters and instrumental
ists often spend their entire careers per-
Ibrming for enthusiasts at festivals and pa
trons at bars and coffee houses while their al
bums are ignored by record stores and com
mercial radio stations. Those few ambas
sadors who do find an audience — such as
the Dixie Chicks and Luanda Williams —
impress critics and listeners alike vviili their
fresh .ind distinctive voices.
Right here in I'alo Alto, we have Brigitte
DeMeyer, who is rapidly gaining popularity
and acclaim with the songs recently released
on her debut record, "Another 1 housand
Miles." It is an album with two distinct, com
peting sounds.
I he first half succeeds without a groove,
the sound of an entire band trying to be as
cozy as an evening on the back porch.
I hroughout, I)eMeyer gets fine ba< king on
guitar from Chris Rossbach and on blue
grass mandolin and fiddle from Mike Mar
sh.ill. I lie accompanying lyrics are appro
priately sweet and nostalgic.
I lie second half of the album showcases
DcMeyer's soul influences and soars atop
piano-driven rave-ups and encrgeti( guitar.
I lie songwriling is darker and grander, too:
Songs like "II By (lliance" are full of danger,
loss and arresting (harisma.
I recently had the chance to *pcak with
DeMeyer about her songs, her newfound
success and how she came to be singing
country music in Silicon Valley.
Tell me a little about your background.
I was born in Michigan. The family

moved around and settled in San Diego. I al
ways loved singing, and, at age N I began
singing in churt h. I grew up listening to soul
singers like Ktta James and Stevie Wonder,
loiter on. I fell in love with the sound of
string instruments. I was drawn tobluegrass
music because stringed instruments are so
central to bluegrass, and that attracts incred
ible musicians.
I've been in a lot of bands. Chris Ross
bach has been my guitar partner forever,
after we met up in the Bay Area. I hiring the
'80s and early 90s, we got a chance to toui
with the Beat fanners — they're probably
before your time. I hey were very well
known and, in fact, toured internationally.
We didn't go with them on the internation
al tour, but here in ilic States oiii band got
a lot of experience and exposure .is their
opening act.
Around about 1995, I went to the Fel
lui ide (Bluegrass) Festival and saw I tnmvlou
Harris, I.vie Lovett, New Crass Revival and
Bela Heck. I here were .ill these ama/ing per
formers, and I realized this was inv calling.
So I began writing m\ own stuff. At
that point, Chris and I were together as a
duo, and then later we added drums and
a bass, 112 inally, we decided to try to make
an album, and it just really came togeth
er. About two months ago, I (juit my da)
job to promote the album lull lime.
What did you do?
I was in marketing fora tech company.
We were playing receptions to earn studio
time; I was working lull time and getting
absolutely no sleep.
I'd always wanted to perform at the
Freight & Salvage (a country / bluegrass
club in Berkeley) — this was like inv dream.
And they'd tell me, "We can't put you on

unless you have an album." I
kept calling them, but they
wouldn't put us on. So, after
the album came out, 1 called
them up again and tliev said,
"We like your stuff... you can
open lor someone."
But I kept pushing them
until they gave us our own
show. And, just last week, we
ffc-rfbrmed there, and there
was a great crowd. People are
really responding to the
album. We've been promot
ing the album at Heat Music,
and we |iist did a show on
publi( radio for KAIAV 91.7.
Tell me about the songs. For
example, "Mama's on a Mis
sion." What does it mean?
Well, each ol these songs
are a piece ol myself, arc
pieces of things happen
ing. " Manias on ,i M issi( Ml"
is about the randomness of
lile. "Mania's on a mission /
disliin' out the wisdom" is
about my mother because
her (hildren are always
calling her up and asking
advice.
"Papa got his wings and
he ain't com in' back" is about
my lather, lie's passed away
and gone up to heaven, so
he's got his wings. "Sister's

preachin' to the (lion from her (ladilku "
is about ni\ sister. She's very sell-right
eous and very wealthy. I don't usually
talk about this in interviews, but the other
song is about her and me . . .

"We're All (ioin' In"?
Yes. And llie next verse ol "Mania's on a Mis
sion" — "Hillbilly jaybird livin' for (lie big lime"
that's inc. "Rides the daily landslide into
town" is about me driving to work in tralTu
What about "Sycamore Sadie"?
That's .1 funny story. There was a man,
John (low.in, who played with New (»rass Re
vival. and I was obsessed with him. I saw him
at Tclluride. He had this great voice, a soul
voice singing hluegrass. That's what I wanted
to do myself. Hut. later, I lound out he was
very hard core. I think he went through a lot
of women. So I wrote "Sycamore Sadie" as the
fictional story of a woman who gels involved
with that kind ol man.
"Another Thousand Miles" is very well pro
duced. What kind of sound were you after?
Well, I know it sounds funny, but I was
going lot .1 southern sound, although we
te< 01 (led il here in the Ba\ Area. 1 .ikr the last
song, "I lorse 11 link." which has almost an All
man Brothers I eel to il.
And I emphasized strings and vocals in the
pioduction. li s not a hluegrass album, bill I
love the siiings and voials in hluegrass. so I
mixed that louder. I've been critici/.ed loi it,
loi not making a (lain cable album, bin thai's
the sound I wanted.
Allothet gteat pari about plaving ai the
freight X.- Salvage, l<»i a silling audience, was
thai I t oill<l |>l.i\ whatcvci I wanted. II vou're
plaving at a bar or Hub, you're there to sell
drinks, so noii have t<> pla\ the more upbcal

si till. And I like lhal, but I like ballads with
guitar, so it's nice to play those ballads fora
live audicnc e.
What do you think of Lucinda Williams
and Sheryl Crow? You must get compared
to them all the time.
I do. A lot of < l it its have compared me to
them. I like I hem both. Sheryl ('.row is very
(oininen ial, but she's got a lot of soul, l.u
-< incla Williams is making great music, too.
If you could he the opening act for anyone,
who would it be?
Oh, wow, anyone? I'd love to open lot
Sam Bush or Steve Karle or Sheryl Crow.
Bruce I lornsby — we've been trying to work
out opening for linn. Kmmylou I larris.
Is there anything else you want your lis
teners to know?
I just hope they enjoy the music and thai it
makes them leel good. I hope they like the
lyrics, too. I made sure they were included
with the album. I mean, I know it's very
cliche, but I just hope the music makes thetn
feel good.
And is there another album in the works?
Well, yes. I've h.icl so much enthusi
asm coining oil the sue cess ol this album.
I've already started writing new songs
and recording rough mixes. We'll proba
bl\ start recording the new album in Au
gust »>i Sc|>tenibei.
