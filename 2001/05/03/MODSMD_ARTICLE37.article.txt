# "Another Thousand Miles"

### JOSEPH KUGELMASS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Brigitte DeMeyer is a remarkable vocalist. On her debut album, "Another Thou
sand Miles," she has the same throaty, naive voice that won Sheryl Crow so many fans
with "Tuesday Night Music Club." DeMeyer hasn't mastered every trick of country
soul singing, but she has does manage to sound cool and confident on every track.
Her longtime partner, Chris Rossbach, displays an equally surprising profession
alism on guitar. Songs like "Rooftop" and "Already Cone" incorporate gorgeous
acoustic playing that is cleaner and mote complex than much of the generic instru
mental work coming out of Nashville. DeMeyer produced the album herself, and she
achieved a rich and organic sound that is enough to make "Another Thousand Miles"
a noteworthy achievement.
But the album still feels like DeMeyer's first time around the block. In several
places, the drum and bass are so low in the mix that ihev disappear, giving the songs
an unfortunate tranquilized feel.
Her songwriting is also still developing. Songs like "Mama's on a Mission" wander
from one image to the next with little purpose or coherence, whereas "We're All Coin'
In,"a ditty about DeMeyer's sister, is vindictive and unflattering. DeMeyer is ;ilso
given to overly countrified description: At one point, she describes driving in traffic as
"rid(ing) the daily landslide into town."
But these lapses are redeemed by flashes of incipient brilliance. "I low am I supposed
to hold on when I'm supposed to let go? DeMeyer asks her ex-lover on the title track.
It is .1 simple line as expressive as anything Steve Karle or l.ucinda Williams has penned.
DeMever is < urrently enjoving a great deal of l<>< al success and may be on the cusp
of national attention. She certainly deserves it. Despite her debut album s flaws, this
California native is making southern music that reminds us all ol why we fell in love
with country in the first plate.
