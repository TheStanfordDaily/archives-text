COLLEEN HASKELL

How does Hollywood stack up with
"Survivor"? Is it any more blood
thirsty than the show?
()l (Ol I I'SC it Is Its I lollvwooti. It's
been .1 learning experience, definite
l\ You've got to learn the game
ijiiii kei than you do the "Survivor"
game. 1 hat's loi sure. It's so much
Inn. It's more real than "Survivor," ol
< oui sc. he< ause this is .1 joh and "Sur
vivoi is .1 game show. So, tins is
something to take sei iouslv and work
reallv hard .it
Are there similarities between the
character you play in the movie and
your "Survivor" persona?
I lie ( hara< lei 1 li.it I plav in the
movie, Rhianna, is leallv sweet. In
the movie's opening, she comes out
ol this tree and she's trying to save
the redwoods. She develops .1 uiisli

on Rob's character. Marvin. I think
she s just i call\ sxvcct t liroughoul. I think tli.it s prett\ much how I was on the "Sin x ivor"
show I me.m. I w.is edited that \va\. lint lam that wax. I mean, I think the "Survivor"
show < .isi me .is this sweet person and, Mi.iybe, edited out times that I wasn't talking too
liighlx oi otliei people.
\S hat was it like working with Robr Was he helpful, being that it was your first film?
Ile n.is great. Nou knoxv. I grew up watt "Saturdax Night l.ive" and tilings like that, so I pist
aluavs thought that lie was great and liinny. and he made it really comfortable. I "hex knew when
t hex hired me that I had nevei done a movie ot anx tliini; like that, and thex never made me feel un
(omloi i,ll ile I rom t ln* in st dax , lie taught me exci x thing I know, \on kuowr ( .omit timing and how
to have a itd.il lotiship with the camera and deal with the camcra without looking like ynu are.
I liings like that. Ile makes it tun Delimtelx.
Alter "Survivor came out and you were something of a celebrity, you seemed kind of anxious to
out ol the spotlight and back to your normal life. What changed your mind?
II si calh I tin n v because it happened so last Afici "Snrx ivor," I xv.is driving at ross count rx and
moving to San l-'raiit is( o. going to a job inici ning at an ad agent x — everything was great. And
then thex asked me to read Ibi this movie. I went in, I read for the t astinj; people, I read with Rob.
I didn't even think about it actually tianspii ing into anything. It was just an easy wax to gel people
oil nix bat k, bet ause thex'd been asking me to do stnll loi a while.
Ihit I auditioned with a bunt h ol other j»ii Is, and I think, to then surpi ise and nix siii pi ise, I got
I lie p.n t. W hen I was < ailed and told that I got the part, thex |iist said. "Congratulations — you st.u t
next week. And th.it was about it. I here was no, "So. do xou want to tit) it?" or, "Is this something
xOll dbe interested in? I i>uess when somebodx oilers you a movie, you don't s,i\ no. That's xvliat
I'xe leai netl.
II you do decide tt» move forward with an acting career, is there any specific genre that you'd
like It) focus on?
\\ ell, t ometlx is so Inn I don t know how these people t an make movies and xvoi kon them
lot loin months and thex re these sob stories. I don't know how emotionally von get through

that. I like comedies.
. they're more tun.
But, really, I don't
know it I'm going to
do any more <h ling.
11 anothei st 1 ipt
< oines along that's as
Inn .aid the people
.ire .is great .is iliev
were on this one,
then nl ( 0111 se Id do
it. It's .1 great job,
you know? Make a
movie? Why not ?
Are you being recog
nized a lot more

now in public?

\ e.ili, a little bit. It's weird when people

come up to me and knowsiulf about my life. Like, if people say.

"Oh. Colleen, how are you doing?" That's line. But when people are like, "How's your
brother. Andrew.'' I hat sort ol 1 reeps me out.

What kind of films do you watch in your spare time?
(l.aughs). In im spare time — this year, I haven't really had that much spare time, so I'm kind
ol out ol the loop with what's been coming out. But I |iist saw "Memento." It's very, very good. I like
films like th.it — smart and interesting, with <1 good story. It doesn't matter — comedy, drama, lau
guage ... I watch a lot ol Kretu h films. 1 like it when they tell a good story.
Have you seen the new "Survivor"?
on know, I used to watch it. I watt lied the lirst two episodes, but I find it hard to watt h. bet .uisc
I get into how I played the game the lirst season — the coulda should,l wouldas, I call them. And I
was thinking about how it < ould have been tlilleretit. And so, when I watched the new one, I found
m\ sell really obsessing about that, and that's not healthy. So I stopped watt liing.
But some ol 11he new contestants! have actually e-mailed me and wanted some atlvice about what
to do after the show. In my opinion, that's harder than "Survivor."
Was there ever a moment where you just wanted to reach out and strangle Jeff Probst?
()li my (>od —we voted linn oil, but they edited 11 out (laughs). We would go up to the thing
and write Jell Probst, and the producers would go (in a stern voice), "(lolleen, redo youi
vote. But, you know, he grows on you. N 011 re stuck with him and those dimples, you know
All right (laughs). I Its a good-hearted guy. I le landed .1 good joh.
l)o you consider yourself a celebrity?
Nt>. Nt). Quick answer on that one. I was on a game show and now I'm the game show gii I
who got .1 movie. I bat's how I (onsider myself.
What's your long-term plan?

I love graphit design. I love working with de
sign, .ind I love storytelling, so I ve been working
on at hiltlren's book fora w bile, and I'd like to see
tiiat through, even if it takes a long time to do it.
Working, with the community and kids and sto
ries All that kind of good stull. I don't think I've
Ibund the perfect job for me, but I know what I
like, so that's hallway there, light?
How would you describe the film?
Rob s t harat tcr, Marvin, lias been trying to be
( onie a polite ollit cr. I le's kind ola lovable loser
kind oi a gux 1 . And I'm the (pauses) girl.
Love interest?
\eah, right. I need to learn that terminology
(laughs). And, you know, hi jinks ensue, with crazy
< harat let s. 1 le into at at at t ident, and Ins inter
nal organs are replat etl by animal pai ts. And he starts
at ting like an annual, and it's crazy. It's fun. It's t tite.
A lot of gross out comedy. Hut not too gross.

ROB SCHNEIDER
How do you develop a
character who's been re
built internally with ani
mal parts?
You know,
when we started this
thing, it took us 10
months to write the
script, .iiul the first one
we literally threw in the
garbage. We literally jusi
threw it away. We only
used two scenes from it.
Because, the thing is, il

the guv's

„ sst?
"

got animal

parts, it's so wide open! We

knew the lirst part was going to be: I Ins guy gets into

a terrible car crash in the mountains and lie's prat tit ally dead and he gets

put I »a< k together with minimal parts. But, you know, is he climbing the walls? Is he part spi
der." Is he squirting ink m people's laces like a liu king octopus? I mean, what i> it, you know?
So we had to figure out what made sense and what didn't make sense.
And, we figured out, it's not just me being a dog. It's a guy trying to stop being a dog, whi< It
is a lot more interesting. So that took me oil the hook a little bit, because I'm not just like a dog
humping things. Kven though that's what I do in the movie. But. he's trying to stop himsell
lioni humping things.
In the trailers, there's a pretty interesting scene with a goat...
\ on know, anyone can have a love scene with a beautiful woman. But how do you pull
:. 11. :. i . i-iii . • i• • • , 1

it oil with a goat and still he romantic, not disgusting. So that's
the line line. Von never know what's gonna turn people off or
make them laugh. In the first draft, some of the stuff we did
with the goat was clearly too far. Yon don't know. It can't just
be gross-out comedy.
Has being involved in the writing process and the post-pro
duction aspects changed your perspective as a performer?
()h yeah, because you see so many of the different art forms
involved. The writing of it is just unbelievably free and fun,
and I don't even think about acting it. But then, I grt out there
and I'm in fid-degree water trying to swim like a dolphin, and
I'm literally getting an icecream headache. And I've got ibis
little kid tied to my back . ..
Which one of the "SNL" characters you created was
your favorite?
I lie Ricluneister was probably the most popular, but
I liked the weed guy. I he tool people mine up to im
am! say, "Hey, you can put your weed in there." And I
go, "< )li, that's tool." Because we only did tb.it twice.
I I came lip with it |at this store in upstate New York.
And everything in there was like these little wooden
drums and wooden boxes delicately carved and a lot of

that kind of stull". I look ,it my older brother and go, "I It-< mild hide his weed in
there." And 1 went ii|> to tlieni and pm this little box on the counter and said,
"Yeah, where does your weed go? I low do I get my weed in there?"
And they just started laughing about it. I was up there with my old girlfriend,
and we were just howling. And then ii ended up turning into this sketch. I wrote
it with Lou Morton, and it was just like (stoner voire), " I his is ,i Senagalese lute.
It's deer wood. It's used in fertility rituals. I hey make one every seven years.
(Switches to normal customer voice). Oh, really? I li.it s interesting. (Swit» lies back
to stoner voice). "Yeah, and your weed goes light m here! (I)illerent customer
voice). Yeah, whaddya d<> with it? (Stoner voice). Ymi put your weed in there."
It's like, the audience knows it's coming and knows its coming and then v<>u give
it t<> them and they still laugh. It's funny, htit the < elisors made sure I had to get
arrested at the end of every episode.

Arc the censors a problem?
\V e have M I'M (Motion Pit ture Association ol Ameri( a) issues, whit h is sut h a pain in the ass I o
ine, I think it's more intent than actual individual disc repant ics. I don't think you should actually
have sex with a goat. I li.it would not he P( M3. But that doesn't mean you can't flirt with .1 goat. You
know? li s a struggle.
Do you miss "SNL"? *
I miss the immediacy ol it. It took me a year and a halt'to get this movie into theaters.
SNl. was great, bet anse you literalh have an idea ruesd.iy and vim find out Saturday 1!
it s funny. Me and Adam Sandler would tome up with slutl, like, when lie and I went to
this Italian restaurant and the waiters were like touching the gii Is we were with, you know,
our girlfriends who we were living with at the time? And I thought, well, ok. It's just their
way. And Sandler < ante up to me ami he was like, "Dude, this is gonna

he the

greatest." And

that's when we wrote the Italian

waitei thing. You know, had them grabbing butts and

— licking fact's and boohs. It was crazy.
Il was <K in.illy mostly Adam and Rob S( hmeigel who wrote it. and I was sitting there
laughing. I hat's where the Italian waiters ( ame from. Before I knew il. I was hat kstage —
buck naked — and Adam was standing there trying to shave Ins pubic hairs and get into a
thong, and 1 was trying to make that thing — what do you < all it. tlu- waiter's apron - I was
trying to get it really so it was like four in< lies wide (laughs). It was )iist fun. The audience
was s< reaming so loud we could barely heat eac h other out there. I'he) were laughing so
hard. I miss that. I miss hanging with pals.
Critics haven't always been on your side. I)o you feel like, at the end of the day, you get
the last laugh?
Absolutely. 'Deuce Higalow was my love letter to people, I was saying thank you for
letting me do what I do. I mean, I didn't expect it to make a ni< kel. Then we s< reened it
for people and they fell out. I here's love in it. I think th.it kinda comes through.
What were some of your greatest inspirations as a young comedian?

Well, Monty I'ython, even though I was .1 kid and 1
didn't understand .1 lot of the stnll those guvs did.
I hey were philosophy majors at ()xford. ()l < onrse,
being an II -year-old, I didn't understand .in\ ol thai
m>< 1.11 atta< k they were doing. But, I cei t.iinlv got the
joy behind it and the silliness and the energ\ and the
absurdity. Monty Python was like .111 absurdist come
dy with .1 logical progression to it. And no matin
what the absurdity, they had that real logit al, almost
malhematk .il intent, but whei eit went was like ,1 le
lentless attai k on the senses, in every wa\
And I'etei Sellers was maybe the funniest pel
(ormer — ever. A hundred yeai s from now, il thev're
still making movies. I'etei Sellers w ill be .1 standout
more than anybody in the last century, I think. And
as lot American guys, I loved (»ene Wilder and
Ri< hard I'ryor. When tliev were on s< reen together,
it was just explosive — especially in "Silvei Streak." A
hall-hoin into the movie, when Ru hard l'i vol shows
up, \oii know, I temeinhei seeing it in a theater and
people were laughing so liaid von ( onldn't heal an\
thing. And I thought, wow, I wanna do that. <

YVhal was it like working with a Hollywood newcomer like Colleen Haskell?
It's really .1 trip because she's never clone anything before, a< ting wise, and it was gre.it
because slit- didn't know any bad habits. She didn't know anything about filmmaking, and
sometimes she would literally be bourn iug in and out ol the frame. But she's so cute and
scx\ Kvcrybody fell in love with her on the movie — litcralh — men and women. She's just
sew and slu-'s like this really < utc gii I and everyone was alwavs like. "What is she talking
about? Who's she talking to? What's she eating?"
It reminded me of high school or something. II she wants to be a star, she could be.
Whatever it is that's a star, she's that. And I also got to work with othei re.illy great actors
like Id Asner and John (1. M< (iinley, who you'd recogni/.e from ()livcr Stone films, fliat
guy is about as intense as it gets, so it was good yin and vang between him and me. But I
love the movie; I just hope it makes everyone else laugh as mm h as it made us laugh when
we were filming it.
