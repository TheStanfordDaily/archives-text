### NATHAN LASCHE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I'oni (ireen lias, in Ins lirst star
ring eHort, "Freddy (iol Fin
gered." created a movie (hal will
live on Ibrever in I he* lore < >1 had
liifTjs. Voii may have laughed at his
portrayal ol college student
"Barry" in "Road I rip." Vou may
have chuckled .it Ins cameo in
"Charlie's Angel's." Well, let me
warn you, il you thought loin
(ireen was weirdly liuim in those
movies, do not let that convince
you to go see this one.
To give (ireen complete cre
ative authoritv and allow him to
write, direct and star in a movie is
to unleash .ill the mischievous
demons in (ireens head and beg
Tiieni to ask," I low can we he as sk k
as possible and still not an \(
17 rating?"
I his movie is about a iiS-vear
old man named (iorcl w ho wants to
be an animatoi and constantl\ gets
into lights with his lather. who
wants 111111 to a real job. And
ill.H s ii. ( )h. and there's also Ins
handic apped-nv inphomani.K -
sadomasochistic girlfriend, his
brother, who (iorcl constantb
claims was sexuallv molested b\

theii lather, and a c ute 8-year-old
bov who gets hit in the lace In liv
ing objects whenevei lie is on the
screen. And that's the plot. Really.
Now, let me establish some
thing: 1 am not one ol those- people
who hates lorn (ireen and thinks
that Ins method ol comedy is in
herenily unlunny. On the con
trary, I am, and have been loi cjuite
some lime, a huge lan ol loin
(ireen. Ihe humor that loin
(ireen displaved lii si on his (lana
cliail ( oniecb Network show and
then on Ins MIA show has alwavs

resonated wit 11 me as a
ti 111 \ new and oiiginal
Ibrm ol comedy. I n
lortunatelv, real-lilie
liuinoi is w here I bin
(ireen should sia\. Ills
siicngth is in impi«>\ i
sat ion based on the i e
ac tions ol real people,
and asc i ipi c onstrains
him lo the point whcie
ever\ joke he makes
appears loi ced and
strained.
In.in attempt lo siu k
with the gross-out
huinoi lb.il has made
him so popular. (ireen
li us to push the enve-

lope in every possible direction. A
lew c lioic e scenes in this masterpiece
were: I) (iorcl delivers a baby in a
hospital and proceeds to hitc
through the umbilical cord with his
teeth and then swing the baby
around his head like a lasso. 2) < >ord
sees a stud ranch dining an "epic"
journey to Los Angeles, and he
jumps out ol his c ar and masturbates
a mare while the c amera zooms in
lor a close-up. !1) Finding a dead
deei h\ the side ol the road, he c tils
open the animal and runs around
the lores! wearing the bloodv c arc ass

as .1 coal until Ik* is hit by .in IN
w heeler going 80 mpli..
Sense <i trend here? I lie
problem (Ireen rims into is tli.it
Ins version ol'gross-out Innnor
in tlu> movie is so outlandish
and so out ol eontext that, in-
I stead ol causing the viewer to
( ringe and then laugh, .is good
gross-out humor does, his
humor causes the viewer to
cringe and then comment to

the person next to him or her,
"Dude, that is just so wrong."
There is one scene that finds
(lord and his lather in Pakistan,
where (lord proceeds to mastur
bate an elephant, causing it to
spray his lather with gallons ol ele
phant semen. This is the climax —
no pun intended — ol the movie,
and, seconds later, as 1 walked out
ol the theater, 1 lelt very much like
(lord's father must have lelt after
receiving his unexpected dousing.
To say I lelt dirty and exhausted
alter having sat through "Freddy
(lot Fingered" would he a gross —
pun intended — understatement.
Green succeeded in making
"Fredd\ (>ot Fingered" what he
wanted it to Ik-: a truly disgusting
and outrageous movie. Yet, in his
single-minded pursuit. Green ne
glected to make Ins virgin solo film
elloi I the ( level and original piece
ol entertainment that his tans have
come lo expect from liim. By the
way, il vou thought lliat the title
was not a sexual reference, then
\ou are too innocent to have even
read 111 is article, and I apologi/.e
lor having exposed \ou to it.


Is il cold in here?


Gel lliee to a decompression
chamber.
