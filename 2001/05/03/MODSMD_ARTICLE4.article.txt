following the annoutucmcnt.
Moerner came to Stanford in 1998 aftet three
years as distinguished chair in physical chemistry at
UC-San Diego.
According t<> the academy, "[ Moerner] pioneered
methods for detecting and observing individual mol
ecules. Before Moerner s work, researchers could
only describe averages, the mass motions and prop
erties of a large crowd of molecules. Being able to
scrutinize the behavior of lone molecules may lead to
extraordinary developments in the stuck of biologic al
molecules."
