### CHRISTOPHER CROWELL 
You don't w.iml to .11 rive lair to
.1 showing oI "Amores I'erros." lii
llic lii si leu minutes, ,i Mistering
tat chase through the streets of
Mexico (lily kills a !>.u i io kid, dis
figures a Spanish supermodel
and leaves a Rotweiler named
(loli near death.
I.ilc m the metropolis is nast\,
brutish and olten short. < >rga
ni/ed dogfights draw hloodlliirstv
crowds. Respectable men cheat
and conspire. But, iu so congest
ed a place, lives are also deeplv in
terconnected, creating a frenetic

energv not confined to the mo
ment ol car-ac c idem impact.
I he film is an assemblage ol
three overlapping storylines. In
the lit st, teenage! (>ctavio (Ciael
(iaic ia liernal) puts Coli on the
doglighting circuit in order to
win the money he needs to elope
with his brother's wile.
Rushing to the veterinarian
alter a savage mate It. ()c tavio c ol
lides with Valeria ((ioya Toledo),
which ignites the second major
storyline. Valei ia is a stunning su
permodel who has |ust won her
lover, Daniel (Alvaro (iuerrero),
awav from Ins wife and children.

Valeria and Daniel return home
alter the ear accident, hut their
love nest turns sour when Vale
ria's Shih T/.u, Richie, tails
through .1 hole in the lloorhoards.
Valeria, confined to .1 wheel
chair .ind fearing the worst, tries
to rescue Richie over several days.
Rats can he heard scurrying un
derneath, making lor ,1 macabre,
though funny, scene.
I lie third storyline revolves
around f.l (ihivo (F.milio Kchevar
ria), .1 vagrant who roams the c ity
with .1 pack ol dogs. 1.1 (Ihivo had
been lured hy (iustavo (Rodrigo
Murrav I'risant) to kill the latter's

brother, bin I ! C.hivo instead kid
naps the two siblings and dares
them to settle the score themselves.
The humor in "Ainores I'er
ros" assumes an appreciation of
the deep class divisions in Mexi
co, and, in many ways, I he film is
a distinctly Latin film. I lie
soundtrack and c ast, both excel
lent, will be- unfamiliar to the av
erage American filmgoer. I lie
subtle satire of Mexico's soap
opera culture may also be lost
on some.
But "Amores I'erros" also has a
universal message, because out
actions 011 this c rowded planet al

led others in ways we can hardly
imagine, we have a responsibility
to one another. I he lilm does not
(.ill lot revolt hut lor simple
human kindness.
"Atnores I'erros" resists the im
pulse to deliver this essentially
conservative message with typical
I lollywood aplomh. Revolution is
not bad but simply impossible.
Trapped beneath the floor
boards, lacing a final vision of
blackness and desolation, we
must .ill do the best we can.
