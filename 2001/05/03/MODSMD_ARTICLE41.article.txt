# Beautifully twisted 'Creatures' abound in Brit crime drama

Is if just nit', or do violent
films that take place 111 dirty
British cities automatically

seem more stylish than
movies that take place in
dirty American cities? Even
something like "Beautiful

Creatures," an unoriginal
crime drama overwrought with
cinematic ( lit lies, can seem

artsy and sophisticated when the
murdered corpse is rotting away
on the balcony of a London flat
instead of in .1 dumpster 111 some
New York alley.
Although many British films
111 the action genre have .111 in
triguing plot and devet script to
justify .1 veneer of edgy sophisti
cation, "Beautiful Creatures" is
not one of them. Its cool British
style doesn't excuse the inade
quacy ol iis substance.
The film, a violent crime
thriller with a feminist slant, was
directed h\ British ncwcomei bill
Kagles. The storyline follows two

female protagonists (Rachel

Weisz and Susan Lynch)
as they escape

abusive

relationships by committing .1 leu
sloppy accidental murders and
stashing the bodies 111 bathtubs.

When the local detective
. finds out, the two women are
forced to spent! the rest of the
film evading the law and lying
to the authorities. Their safety
is also repeatedly threatened
by a swarm of men who are ac
curately referred to as "bastards"
and include violent psychotic

junkie boyfriends
violent alco

holic chauvin

ist Im>\ friends

perverted teenaee bovs

and perverted middle age cops.
If the violent e-meeis-fe
niale bonding theme of the
film has convinced you that
ibis is merely a British "Tliel
111a and Louise" tip-off , you're
only half right. Although the
premise is exactly the same,
"Beautiful Creatures" is more
stylish, more violent and the
role played by Brad I'itt in

I helma and I.ouisc"
is played by a large
white dog in ibis
flick. So there are
differences.
