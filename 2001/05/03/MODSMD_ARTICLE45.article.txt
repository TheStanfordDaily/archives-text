# SF Ballet scores hat trick with moody program
## 
### CAROLINE SAKAMOTO STAFF WRITER 
I lie San Francisco Ballet recently performed a smorgasbord of a program. The neo
classical cavorted with the romantic — and, believe it or not, it worked. 1 he triple-head
er composed ol Mark Morris's "Pacific, Yuri Possokhov's "Magrittomania" and (ieorge
Balachine's "Symphony in (1" showcased the company s llair in a big way.
"Pacific is pure eye candy. Nine men and women, swathed deliciously 111 (lowing
white costumes tinged with red, green or blue, represented the joy, romance and free
dom ol the ocean. I he dance was set to .1 series ol lovely string solos and trios by Lou
Harrison. I here was no set for "Pacific;" rather, the dancers themselves provided the
backdrop.
four women in green danced a serene, calming 1 rihutc to the peace within the ocean.
I Ins was followed by ,1 breathtaking pas-de-deux in red. I he couple's lines were long
.ind elegant, and they seemed to be drawing out each violin note with the extension ol
.111 arm or .1 leg, a gesture which evoked the passion ol ihe Pacific and its natives. Roy

Malun and David kadaraueh's soaring solos on violin and cello could not have had a bet
ici accompaniment.
Anolher vignette alluded to the playful nature of the ocean, as well .is its power.
(ireen.s and hlues hounced around the stage in contradictor poses, as it ihc\ were each
.1 little ripple competing lor attention. I he only sync hroni/ation was in the poses of the
men. At several points, they formed .1 wall of strength at the hack of the stage, raising their
arms like a powerful wave.
"Magrittomania," a celebration of the mind ol the surrealist painter Rene Magrittc,
was a joy to watch. Not only did set and costume designer fhvra Hartshorn rise ad
mit ahl\ to the challenge of evoking Magi itic s offbeat paintings, but the dancers met the
( hallenges of the work with gusto.
1 he piece opened with a pre>jection ol mining men on a giant screen, whic li then
gave way to a variety of wild images from the Paris Metro to clouds to ballerinas in

dresses with lake breasts plastered on the front. Magritte's world is topsy-turvy and
inside out, and (lu- choreography is no diiferent. Jumps look random. Poses are off
center. Arabesques alternate between loony and elegant. 1 he jerky is juxtaposed
with the liquid, falls? I hey aren't mistakes — they are part of the dance.
Hut the most enthusiastic response was to Muriel Maflre as the mysterious Lady
in Red. She is the type of dancer,tall and refined in the tradition of tlie prima balle
rina, who makes the impossible look like .in aftcribought. She began with a delicate
dance performed with one hand behind her back and was joined by a corps de b.*s
- (still in those disturbing breast dresses) that was similarly "handicapped." It
seemed to be a commentary on ability and disability. Maflre then performed a heav
enly pas-dc-deux with the adept benjamin Pierce, who wisely deferred to Maffre's
slat power.
I lie music was .is edgy and oflbeat as the srts, and the orchestra danced right
along with the company, enjoying the rare opportunity to play discordant music:
Krasavin's bizarre treatment of poor Beethoven's well-known work.
balaibine's "Symphony in (1 is the kind of classical piece that makes one want to

dance. but how is anyone supposed to roc k out to < lassie al music? balac bine's choreog
raphy pulls it oil. Apparently, the companv has performed ibis piece belbre with shaky
results, but, this time, it worked. I he piece is ,i series of. and I mean this kindly, "River
danc c"-likc corps numbets that feature seriously complicated lootwork.
Four couples pei lot med in all. but Roman Rvkiue and Yuan Yuan I an stood out in
the first and second movements. Rykine showed oil the alll l \ and roc k-solici leaps am!
landings that made Ins pel loi manee as the bluebird in "Sleeping beauty" so memorable.
And fan's grace during the slow movement drew < beers as she calmly bent into painful
looking arabesques and floated in perlec 1 time to the music.
I he ballet's next olfcring involves a guest company, the Paris ()pera Ballet, which will
perform "l.e ba\adere" and "fe Pare" in early May.


That's it! I' m taking my ball, and I'm going home!
