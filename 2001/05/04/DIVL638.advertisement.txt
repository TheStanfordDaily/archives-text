Earth Week, 2001, activist/actor Woody
Harrelson is embarking on a lourney
A physical journey A spiritual journey.
Harrelson will be bicycling down the
beautiful Pacific Coast Highway from
Seattle to Santa Barbara Along the way,
Harrelson will stop at college campuses,
and will make impromptu appearances at
different locations. He will speak about
the need for ecological reform, the need
to halt the destruction of our rainforest
by industry, the need to halt the poisoning
of our bodies by pesticides, the need to
change the devastating impact our
species is having on this planet, the need
to change the impact current corporate
culture is having on our species, and the
need for people to wrench themselves
from the corporate grid.
Woody will be followed by a bio-fuel bus
run on hemp oil and vegetable oil. The
bus will be equipped with solar powered
appliances and a green-house, which
will produce organic foods for the
journey. Also on the bus will be an
assortment of Harrelson's friends.
He's going to give lectures at schools,
and hold massive Yoga classes at ran
dom locations. He's going to introduce
people to organic food, painted fruit,
hemp clothing and conscious, low
impact living Come rain or shine, come
fun or family crises, we'll all be insiders
with a full-access backstage pass.
We II all be "on the bus."
