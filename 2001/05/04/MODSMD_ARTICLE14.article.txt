hate-group material
SAN JOSE (AP) — Internet auction giant eßay
Inc. is banning the sale of artifacts from Nazi Ger
many, the Kw klux Klan and notorious criminals, in
hopes of avoiding legal problems in other countries.
EBay had already banned items that promote
hate or violence, but allowed artifacts that were
more than 50 years old to be listed as "collectibles."
Users were warned not to take bids on Nazi items
from people in France, Germany, Austria or Italv
because of laws in those countries. Users with
French- or German-language Web browsers also
were blocked from searching for Nazi-related items,
eßay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said.
The new policy, which was announced yesterday
and takes effect May 17. eliminates the historical ex
emption and,bans the items completely.
As eßay expands overseas, "we are encountering

different laws and different points of view as to what
constitutes illegal, offensive or inappropriate items,"
said Mike Jacobson, eßay's general counsel.
