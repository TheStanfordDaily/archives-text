Butalia is the anthoi of "I Ik- ()ther Side of Silence:

dramati( events affects the rest of their lives, (lonse
(|uentlv, the\ relay this inform.ition through oral histo
ry which greatlx em it lies traditional socioeconomic
and political forms of history.

"Most <>t my work is based on interviews," Butalia
said. "We are largeh taught the political historv of par
tition . . . Vcr\ little attention is paid to the people who
li\cd through this and what happened to them."
I hrough what she describes as a rather random sc
ries of interviews conducted while aiding citi/ens af
fected l)\ ihcait.u ks following the 198-1 assassination of
Indira (»antlhi, Hutalia learned that the ramifications
of this event were similai to those lollowing Partition.
In turn, she began to investigate the response ol hci
own famiK inembei s to the di\ ision < >l their homel.ind.
I Icr interests narrowed to a study of women, chil
dren and people of low < astes. She explained that oral
history in particular is crucial to understanding tlie his
tory of these groups.

"Mut.ilia's woi k .iiul approat li has reallv sei ved as the

veals that shared hnni.in suffering ami shared

human experience extend across these borders.
I'll rough understanding that living voices can tran
scend borders drawn with blood, we may be able to
discover the common ground and humanity that
brings hope for peace."
Kutalia has presented her insights on oral historv in
her book. I fowever, she explained that she had no con
crete plan to work on a book in the first place. "This is
not really a book project in the normal sense — most
people write a book, then move on. This is very difficult
for me ... I feel I have tokeepconnei ting these stories.
I hey re such a part of our psyche on the subconti
nent," she said.
