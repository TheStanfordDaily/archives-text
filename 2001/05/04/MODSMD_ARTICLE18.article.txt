## The
						Stanford Daily Hewlett gift gives Stanford chance to renew faith 
### 
Published Since IMI

WEDNESDAY'S ANN( )UN( IEMENT
of a $400 million gift in unre
stricted funds to the University
from the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation swept campus on
Wednesday, giving more than a tew humanities
majors and undergraduates renewed faith in
the future of the University. This gift is the
largest amount of money ever given to an
American universitv and possibly the largest in
the world. The fact that these funds are unre
stricted in nature and the University's promise
to use them on the Sch<x>l of 1 lumanities and
Sciences and the Campaign for Undergradu
ate Education represent a significant step for
ward for Stanford and the quality of the edu
cation it offers.
Wh.it is perhaps most exciting about this an
nouncement is that the gift is intended to honor
the late William I lewlett, who graduated from
the University in 1934, and who, along with

longtime friend David Packard, had already do
nated more than $300 million to Stanford prior
to Wednesday's announcement. Such alumni
support is inspiring, especially in light of the fact
that Stanford, as a school with a much shorter
history than some peer institutions, has lagged
notoriously in alumni giving. We applaud the
foundation's dedication to the University and
hopethat this, along with the recent report of an
<S2 percent increase in donations in the 2000 fis
cal year, will strengthen the bonds between the
University and other alumni.
University President |ohn Hennessy assured
students and faculty Wednesday that the major
ity of the gift—s3oo million — will go to the
School of I lumanities and Sciences, saying, "Re
sources are not available fin humanities and sci
ences." This is, in fact, the case, and we com
mend Hennessy's acknowledgment of this real
ity, as well as his decision to f<x us on attracting
more professors to the University and strength

ening teaching here.
Hennessy's allotment of $100 million for
the Campaign for Undergraduate Education
should also be applauded. These funds,
which will endow undergraduate scholar
ships and be applied directly to undergradu
ate education, will invigorate the undergrad
uate community. Additionally, this gilt will
spur the efforts of the campaign. As Hen
nessy said, I lewlett himself was a huge pro
ponent of undergraduate education, and it is
only appropriate that the funds honor him
accordingly.
I lowever, as noted in an April 25 Daily edi
torial ("('communication key to successful pres
idency"), the University has made such
promises before — in I lennessy's October in
augural address, for instance.'The extent to
which these pledges have been fulfilled is de
batable, so faculty, students and staff must re
main vocal and involved in deciding the Uni

versity's direction to ensure that their needs
are met. Even though the donated funds have
been promised to two general areas, a great
deal of variability still exists within these cate
gories, and it falls to the University to commu
nity to encourage administrators to fulfill their
obligations to the School of Humanities and
Sciences and to undergraduates.
Because this gift is framed as a "challenge" to
encourage other potential contributors to pro
vide matching donations, we hope that other
alumni and the University at large meet this
challenge. This gift has great potential, and, if
used wisely, the money could endow professor
ships and sch< ilarships for years to come. There
fore, we offer a challenge of our own: Make this
donation a turning point for Stanford, one at
which this university begins building — or re
building — its core. We have a chance to renew
our commitment to a rounded education, so the
challenge now is to capitalize upon it.
