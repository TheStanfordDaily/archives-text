# EDIT WORTHY
## Draw mania takes hold 
### 
I came into spring quarter knowing
that the Draw would Ik' stressful,
hut 1 expected to receive more ad
vice from, well, everyone. To begin
with, I got lost somewhere on the first
page of the Housing and Dining Services
red information packet, which is as inde
cipherable and abstract as ,111 existentialist
piece by Kafka. The packet attempted to
"explain" the priority "leveling" system,
deadlines and what it means to draw tin
preferred. 1 felt like 1 was trying to read
Greek.
The Draw, now a cutthroat competi-

tion for housing, has
turned the self-pro
claimed "laid-back"
Stanford student body
into an overly competi
tive group of students
unwilling to divulge top
secret information per
taining to the complex
procedure. I'm not ask-

ing for hints or an unfair upper hand (I
didn't even try to enter my group into the
disability Draw). A simple "Go here to get
a priority form" or "you have to get this
signed by a certain date," would have
been nice.
1 found it troubling that many upper
classmen would not help freshmen with
some of the confusing logistics of the
Draw. Walking over to Suites iti an at
tempt to gain priority, imagine my sur
prise at the number of current residents
who "didn't understand" the procedure
at all. Forgive me for being cynical, but 1
find it very hard to believe that those who
have already experienced the Draw, in
many cases numerous times, have "for
gotten" how it works.
It seems that, through an upperclass
man's eyes, each curious freshman be
comes the enemy — a foreigner trying to
set up camp on their territory. Maybe the
lack of advice from upperclassmen exists
as a symptom of their own freshmen ex
periences with the Draw. It seems that the
genuine sentiment from Stanford's elders
is "figure it out yourselves" or "learn tin
hard way, like we did." Consequently, the
cycle of "non-mentoring" is perpetuated.
Each new upperclassman will hesitate to

givc advice to struggling freshmen be
cause of the idea passed down from older
students that their Stanford housing secu
rity may be threatened.
What I didn't expect was that the atti
tudes of people would shift from ultra
cool to inordinately cold-hearted 111 the
blink of an eve. As my Draw group col
lapsed (or, more truthfully, as it ripped
apart .it its seams) two days ago, I realized
the seriousness associated with the Draw.
At that point, I thought that it was each
person for themselves, that friendship
and loyalty meant nothing in the midst of
a "housing < t isis." Ihe new Draw motto
could be: Stanford's Draw — a lesson in
Darwin's theory of "survival of the fittest."
I never expected that forming a Draw
group would c ause so much angst. All you
do is grab a couple of vout closest ft iends
and decide where you want to live, right?
Wrong, l otming the group has inorphed
into a life lesson about inc lusivity and ex
clusivity. As people forgo one group for
another, and as others aren't recruited at
all, it becomes painstakingly necessary to
understand that these living arrange
ments shouldn't at all be taken personal
ly — that just because two people can't be
roommates next year doesn't mean that
they can't be the best of friends. I lie pro
cess involves choosing roommates, not
choosing friends.
I he timing of the Draw doesn't lessen
the temperaments of anxious and frus
trated students, either. Placed conve
niently in the middle of the quarter, forc -
ing students to juggle "traumatic" person
al events along with the usual rush of
midterms and papers, the Draw tnav be
just stressful enough to cause this sudden
change in attitude and demeanor.
Regardless of what happens in this
next week, the Draw will be over and
Stanford students will be able to return to
that laid-back attitude that the sunny Cal
ifornia weather calls for — that same
laid-back attitude that first attrac ted me
to the University.
