What could bring together
dozens of Harvard and Stanford
students, along with a set ol distin
guished panelists on polities, the
media, education and social ac
tivism? Political correctness.
Instantaneously crossing three
time /ones and -5,000 miles, stu
dents from Harvard and Stanford
Universities linked by live tele
satellite and tat kled the term of po
litical correctness and its implica
tions for tolerance in the I'nited
States.
On a screen in the Graduate
School of Uusiness's Bishop Audi
torium, Stanford students
watched a live video feed of their
Harvard counterparts, who were
simultaneoush seeing them on
screen in Harvard's Wiener Audi
torium m the Kenneth School of
(Jovernment.
Yesterday's \ ideoconference
was the inaugural event for the
Face of America dialogue series,
taking place .it Stanford on June 2
and June 'J and at Harvard on
Sept. 2K and Sept. 29.
"Our goal is to create a new
type of dialogue on diversity at

college campuses like Stanford
and Harvard," s.iid senior Mike
Levin, moderatoi and co-organiz
er of the event.
(hganizers chose to kick off the
series by discussing political cor
rectness because of the t< >pic s per
vasiveness in today's society and
because of the many differing
opinions surrounding its meaning
and function.
For example, participants de
bated questions such as, "Is politi
cal con ecu less a tool of social delu
sion and avoidance, or is n.i tool of
challenge and improvement?"
Also posed was,"I las political cor
rectness created .i f.ilse sense of
mutual respect that lias impeded
open dialogue?"
Responses varied widely, as or

include all points of view regard

"I feel it's a discursive tool we use
that in.ikes people feel like they're
being respected and understood."
said Fddie liruce, a member of the
I larvard student panel.

only vehicle — for learning and

understanding each other," said
( lunula Prescod-Weinstein, also a
Harvard student panelist. "It can
be a good thing as long as people
understand win its being used in
stead of using it because they're
afraid of looking bad."
Next to respond were the three
student panelists from Stanford:
seniors Hrandon Chock and Elly
Matsamura. and sophomore Ten i
Mosqueda.
Commenting on Prescod-We
instein's view of political correct
ness as a vehicle tor learning,
Mosqueda shared a personal anec
dote about her experience with a
young Kast Palo Alto girl she tu
tored who had remarked tli.it
Mosqueda "looked so Mexican."
We learned because we had
mutual respect for each other,"
Mosqueda said. "\\'e did it without
political correctness."
I have problems with political
correctness in that it insists, if you
aren't politically correct or don't
use politically correct terms, you
must be a bigot or ignorant,"
( '.hock said.
( hock maintains society would

do well to adopt a lighter and more
candid approach to issues sur
rounding diversity, especially
stereotypes.
"In taking this approach, it's
important to realize and acknowl
edge that we are affected by
[stereotypes and epithets], and
that can't be dismissed as just a
joke," Matsamura said.
She added that, in the United
States, political correctness has a
function in popular culture and
the media to stop the spread of po
tentially harmful stereotypes.
"A lot of people in this country
rely on the media to make impor
tant decisions — vote, hire and
promote, generate informal net
works — so political correctness as
it applies to how groups are por
trayed is necessary if we want to
politically empower as many peo
ple as possible," she said.
1 he social implications of polit
ical correctness, m addition to the
personal, were a hot topic at the
videoconference.
Panelist William kennard, for
mer chairman of the Federal Com
munications Commission, said he
agreed with Matsamura on the role
of the media in social change. He
also pointed to the need for the four
big television networks to represent
the diverse make up of the United

States, not just a certain predomi
nantly white demographic.
"I grew up in the '60s, and, back
then, it was truly an event in my
household whenever there was a
black person on television," Ken
nard said.
The debate progressed from
nomenclature to images to chil
dren. Many commented on politi
cal correctness's effects on future
generations of U.S. society.
"The three main ways kids
learn about political correctness is
through family, educational insti
tutions <uul the media," panelist
James Steyer said.
"Even if it fosters a type of re
spect that isn't genuine, that's
okay, because it will allow our t hil
dren to grow up with a wealth of
multiple perspectives," Harvard
student panelist Seng Yell said.
"For our kids' sake, it's good
that the term fireman was
changed to the politically-correct
term 'firefighter,' " said Linda
Harrison, director of Stanford's
Women's Community Center.
"From imagination comes reality,
and children need to grow up
with the ability to imagine them
selves in specific roles."
Political correctness as an issue
in and of itself also came under
fire at one point during the

videoconference.
"We have permitted those in
the dominant society to pla\ these
games with us, forcing us to ask
ourselves why we are being decent
and civil to each other, framing it
in terms of political correctness," S.
Alan Counter, director of the I lar
vard Foundation, said.
He said he believes political cor
rectness has become a label itself
for nomenclature that is mcrelv
due civility and common decency.
"I know the power of I larvard
and Stanford," said James Mon
tova, vice provost for student af
fairs. "What 1 hope to arrive .it
today are solutions to some of the
issues we have been discussing."
" This was a good preview of
what we're going to be doing in
June," Levin said following the
conference. "We discussed these
issues of political correctness toda\
so that hopefully we can move be
yond that in June."
Levin, along with co-organi/ers
Camellia Rodrigue/.-Sackßyrne
and David Solow, also Stanford se
niors, are planning to expand the
series, perhaps touring colleges
across the nation and including
more public and private schools.
