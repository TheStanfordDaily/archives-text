Wais explains University's
efforts to address graffiti
University President John Hennessy lias
asked me to update the < ainpus community
on the actions the University has taken to ad
dress the incidents of racist graffiti since our
last report in the April 1 7 issue of The Daily.
First, Polite Chief'Marvin Moore reports
that the Stanford Polite Department re
mains vigilant in pursuing any and all leads
in their ongoing investigation. Assistant
Dean of Students Tommy lee Woon will
convene an advisory group to update and
refine the University's Ads of Intolerance
Protocol. This protocol helps guide the Uni
versity's prevention, education and response
initiatives to acts of intolerance or threats to
community. Students will be asked to serve
on this advisory group, which will report to
the Dean of Students ()ffice.
The University will be partnering with
students in a variety of ways to address acts of
intolerance and threats to community. As a
first step, students were invited to participate
in a working group of staff members from
throughout the University (President's Of
fice, Stanford Police, Dean of Students,
Community Centers, Religious Life, Resi
dential Kducation and others). I his group
meets on a quarterly basis to discuss acts of
intolerance on campus. Students joined in
this discussion and were invited to become
permanent members of the working group.
The group decided to act on the follow
ing initiatives: Students and staff volun
teered to serve on a newly created commu

nications committee, designed to create a
model by which the Dean of Students (Mlice
can help the University enhance its commu
nity relations regarding acts of intolerance.
Students and staff discussed the possibility of
convening a one-day retreat in May to dis
cuss acts of intolerance and the general c am
pus climate. The group dec ided to convene
.is ,i working group on .1 monthly basis be
ginning in September, in lieu of quarterly
meetings.
Above and beyond these developments,
tlu- University appreciates many of the activ
ities coordinated independently by students
to address acts of intolerance. While these
acts of intolerance diminish all of us in the
Stanford community, they also provide us
with an opportunity to come together as a
community to support one another and reaf
firm our commitment to the human spirit.
Within this context, we will be sure to keep
the community informed of developments
regarding this important matter as needed.

Asian alumni group
speaks about racist graffiti
The Board of Directors of the Stanford
Asian Pacific American Alumni Club has
been very concerned about the racist graffiti
on campus. I.ast month, we met with Vice
Provost LtDoris Cordell, Dean of Students
Marc Wais, Assistant Dean of Students
Tommy Lee Woon and representatives

from the Stanford Police Department to dis
cuss the issue and the University's actions.
We were very reassured to learn that the
University had developed a "Protocol for
Addressing Acts of Intolerance" and that
University President John Hennessy had
taken steps to inform staff members about
the incident. We trust that all members of
the University encourage a supportive envi
ronment for people, regardless of race, gen
der, age, sexual orientation and ability.
Without the benefit of inspecting the pro
tocol (because it was not released at the time
of our meeting), we would like to reiterate a
couple of concerns: The discovery of graffiti
instructing people to rape women should in
crease the level of security on campus, be
cause the vandal could be a threat to campus
safety. To protect students, additional pa
trols are needed on campus where students
may study at night History Corner
and the Coffee House). Students should be
warned via signs posted in locations adjacent
to the defaced sites and notices in student
dorms.
At the meeting, we asked why the Uni
versity relies on Ihe Daily to be the infor
mation distribution method for students. If
there was a vandal (or other threat to cam
pus safety, including rapists, slashers and
natural disasters) present during finals
week, would the University wait until the
next issue of The Daily to warn people
about it?

Column about disability Draw inaccurate
•
I am writing to clarify several points
raised in Josh Fried s column on the disabil
ity Draw "Disability Draw easy to abuse"
(May 2).
fhe column argues that "mam students
choose to enter the disabilit\ Draw "to in
crease their chances ol securing premier
housing.'' In tact, this year there were only
HO undergraduates (out ot approximated
6,000 undergraduates housed on campus)
who applied for disability accommodations
by the fust-round deadline and who re
ceived accommocl.itions in undergraduate
housing. Kven il one adds the ver\ small
number of undergraduates who applied fbi
disability accommodations during the Near
to this figure, it still means that fewer than
two out ot every 100 Stanford undergradu
ates sought accommodations .it am point
during 2000-01.
I lic column also suggests that, in the dis
ability Draw, ".t completed application is an
accepted application." I his is inaccurate —
the Disability Resource Center carefully re
views all applications for disability accom
modations and rejects those that are either
inappropriate or lac k adequate medical
documentation.
Finally, it is important to note that stu

dents who apply for the disability Draw re
ceive a Draw number as part ot their appli
cation, just as students who apply for hous
ing in the general University Housing Draw
do. If there is more than one space on cam
pus that can accommodate a student, she will
be assigned to the residence that most close
ly corresponds to her Draw number (based
on last year's Draw cutoffs). I bus. a student
who requests access to a residence with an
open kitc hen could potentially be assigned
either to a Row House (if he receives a low
Draw number) or to Mit rielees (it he receives
a high Draw number).

Disability Resource Center does 'amazing
job' meeting student needs
I .1111 writing in response to |osb Fried's
Wednesday column concerning the disabili
ty Draw, especially the many parts 1 found
offensive and unsubstantiated.
Fo suggest that developing asthma or a
food allergy would be "ideal" is a slap in the
face to anyone with these conditions. Last
year, one of my friends, who is deathly aller
gic to nuts, was rushed to the emergency
room after eating a dining li.ill dish that (lie
st.ifl mistakenly assured her contained no
nuts. Although she entered the disability
Draw last year (and drew preferred), 1 am
sure she would trade Fried both her allergy
and her assignment to "a spacious two-room
double on the lower Row": Mirrielees.
People yvith disabilities are as discriminat
ed against as any other group today. Be
cause of the negative connotations of being
"disabled," many people with disabilities
hesitate to come forward and demand equal
lights. Fhe injustices of job hiring discrimi
nation and inaccessible buildings have led to
changes. I he Americans with Disabilities Ac t
was passed in 1000. Ii is "an ad to establish a
clear and comprehensive prohibition ot dis
crimination on the basis of disability." At

Stanford, the Disability Resource Center is
the most valuable source of information and
assistance for students with disabilities.
I he duties of the center are many, but the
disability Draw that Fried discusses is its best
known. The disability Draw offers students
housingthat accommodates .1 medically doc
umented disability. The center discourages
abusing the disability Draw and does an
ama/ing job of meeting the needs of disabled
students. From personal contact, 1 find that
the employees .it the center are kind, help
ful, honest and giving, and through the dis
ability Draw, it fulfills an important role: giv
ing students with disabilities an accessible,
accommodating place to live.
It seems that the column contains some un
founded assumptions: Every application is not
necessarily approved, and <1 completed appli
cation is not an approved application. The
center must have information from a doctor
on tile fora student to enter the disability
Draw, and requests do get denied. Beyond
some requirements, the center cannot be ex
pected to investigate each student's claim.
1 believe the question, "When is a person's
medical condition more than simply incon
venient?" is not for Fried or the center or the
I niversity to answer. The responsibility to
not abuse the vital resource called the disabil
ity Draw is given to students, just as is the re
sponsibility to not cheat. If a student enters
the disability Draw hoping for assignment to
.1 premier housing space, that student is .it
fault and no one else.
I .1111 .1 sophomore living in Columbae
who has diabetes, takes shots before meals
and often needs a quick source of sugar to
treat low blood sugars. Living in .1 dorm with
University dining last year, I often missed
meals because, when the dining hall was
open, mv blood sugar was too high for me to
eat. Also, I spent hundreds of dollars .1
month buying snacks at Safeway for low
blood sug.tt emergencies. I entered the dis
ability Draw in the spring, requesting a house
with an open kitchen and drawing preferred.
I was assigned to ('.olumbae, .1 house that
chew 2412 and under for men last ve.it. With

food always available. I .1111 healthier, happi
er and I waste a lot less monev.and I know I
did not abuse the Draw.
The disability Draw is as fair as it c an be
without overstepping legal and moral
boundaries. In my opinion, the center
could not do its job am better, and the fact
that the University recognizes the need loi
such a program shows tail ness and respon
sihility. No one should be ashamed to utilize
the center's resources, nor should any per
son with a disability feel selfish toi request
ing accommodation.

The Scoop's creators respond to criticism
There seem to be a tew people who teel it
is their job to criticize " The Stanford Scoop."
I lie reason tor their continual onslaught ol
destructive criticism is somewhat ambigu
ous. What evokes the need in these people to
ream a student-run, student-produc ed and,
thus far, student-tin.mc ed I V show, one that
has only had three episodes and is in its cre
ative and developing stages? Is ii simph be
cause they do not think it is lunm ?
Well, the\ have their opinions, but there
are such things as opposing opinions, and
many people have said that the show is, in
tact, funny. Regardless, we thank vou lot
treating us like- we're .1 network television
show In setting sue li high standards for us.
Maybe, in clue time, if we "try harder" and
actually get funding and actualk get equip
ment and actually get .1 stable crew and
aren't juggling jobs, classes and other ex
tracurricular activities, we can get to be .is
tunny and as talented as the people 011 "Sat
urday Night Live" or "Friends."
Maybe our "critics" feel it is their <lut\ to
save the world from "subjecting itself to si ic h
trash," as tliev might sa\. Well, if this were the
case, one would hope these "heroes would
write to the producers, studios, networks,
writers and actors when a nationally svndi

rated movie 01 I V show aits and is an abso
lute "debat If. like I lie Stanford St (Hip."
Wh\ set small goals lot .1 student-pro
duced I \ show without a budget? l liese
students seem to know what networks
should and should not spend their mone\
on. so we challenge them to spread tlieii
knowledge and expertise: (Jo big. Let I lolly
wood know. Save the nation, please, from
having to watch "unfunm, untalented" IV
shows and movies. Or mavbe out "critics"
just have a lot of time 011 theii hands. II this
were the case, a suggestion: (iet a lite.
Kathei than spending \Olll free time at
tempting to destroy something others are
trying to < reate, wh\ not do something con
structive. As with our response on I V, these
people might view this suggestion .is "dis
plaving a remarkable la< k of class." Please.
