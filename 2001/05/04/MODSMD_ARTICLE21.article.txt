Wais explains University's
efforts to address graffiti
University President John Hennessy lias
asked me to update the < ainpus community
on the actions the University has taken to ad
dress the incidents of racist graffiti since our
last report in the April 1 7 issue of The Daily.
First, Polite Chief'Marvin Moore reports
that the Stanford Polite Department re
mains vigilant in pursuing any and all leads
in their ongoing investigation. Assistant
Dean of Students Tommy lee Woon will
convene an advisory group to update and
refine the University's Ads of Intolerance
Protocol. This protocol helps guide the Uni
versity's prevention, education and response
initiatives to acts of intolerance or threats to
community. Students will be asked to serve
on this advisory group, which will report to
the Dean of Students ()ffice.
The University will be partnering with
students in a variety of ways to address acts of
intolerance and threats to community. As a
first step, students were invited to participate
in a working group of staff members from
throughout the University (President's Of
fice, Stanford Police, Dean of Students,
Community Centers, Religious Life, Resi
dential Kducation and others). I his group
meets on a quarterly basis to discuss acts of
intolerance on campus. Students joined in
this discussion and were invited to become
permanent members of the working group.
The group decided to act on the follow
ing initiatives: Students and staff volun
teered to serve on a newly created commu

nications committee, designed to create a
model by which the Dean of Students (Mlice
can help the University enhance its commu
nity relations regarding acts of intolerance.
Students and staff discussed the possibility of
convening a one-day retreat in May to dis
cuss acts of intolerance and the general c am
pus climate. The group dec ided to convene
.is ,i working group on .1 monthly basis be
ginning in September, in lieu of quarterly
meetings.
Above and beyond these developments,
tlu- University appreciates many of the activ
ities coordinated independently by students
to address acts of intolerance. While these
acts of intolerance diminish all of us in the
Stanford community, they also provide us
with an opportunity to come together as a
community to support one another and reaf
firm our commitment to the human spirit.
Within this context, we will be sure to keep
the community informed of developments
regarding this important matter as needed.

Asian alumni group
speaks about racist graffiti
The Board of Directors of the Stanford
Asian Pacific American Alumni Club has
been very concerned about the racist graffiti
on campus. I.ast month, we met with Vice
Provost LtDoris Cordell, Dean of Students
Marc Wais, Assistant Dean of Students
Tommy Lee Woon and representatives

from the Stanford Police Department to dis
cuss the issue and the University's actions.
We were very reassured to learn that the
University had developed a "Protocol for
Addressing Acts of Intolerance" and that
University President John Hennessy had
taken steps to inform staff members about
the incident. We trust that all members of
the University encourage a supportive envi
ronment for people, regardless of race, gen
der, age, sexual orientation and ability.
Without the benefit of inspecting the pro
tocol (because it was not released at the time
of our meeting), we would like to reiterate a
couple of concerns: The discovery of graffiti
instructing people to rape women should in
crease the level of security on campus, be
cause the vandal could be a threat to campus
safety. To protect students, additional pa
trols are needed on campus where students
may study at night History Corner
and the Coffee House). Students should be
warned via signs posted in locations adjacent
to the defaced sites and notices in student
dorms.
At the meeting, we asked why the Uni
versity relies on Ihe Daily to be the infor
mation distribution method for students. If
there was a vandal (or other threat to cam
pus safety, including rapists, slashers and
natural disasters) present during finals
week, would the University wait until the
next issue of The Daily to warn people
about it?
