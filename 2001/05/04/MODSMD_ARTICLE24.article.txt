Stanford's Society of Women Engi

1 lie event, now in its sixth vear, be
gins with the students' arrival in the
mot tling when the\ attend three ol the
I:> wot ksliops put on b\ profess* >rs and
graduate students.
\ltei It mi h, the students pat tit ip.tt e
in an engineering competition in
groups of tour. I Ins veat s ( hallenge is
lor the students to take given tn.itenals
and build .t bridge across the San 112 t an
cisco Bay.
Each student in a group takes on the
role <>la dillerent engineet. 1 lieie will
be a materials engineer, an industrial
engineer, a civil engineet and an envi
ronmental cniiinccr.

Fxploring New Worlds seeks to
brill}; together students from area ele
mental \ schools lot a <lax ol liiii with
science and engineering," said sopho
more .ajMcixis ol.the event's
coordinators. It is out hope that this
even! max inspire an interest in the sc i
eiK es .Mid in engineci ins;.
\cc ending lo Wallcn, approximately
(i() Stanford students volunteered to he
group leaders loi the clay, which in
cludes taking students to workshops
and guiding them ill rough the compe
tition. In addition, about 'M) Stanford
laculu and students will lead work
shops on a \ .ii ut\ of science and engi
neering topics.
Copies include I lie Unsinkable
Ship: I he I itanic and the Laws of
I'hvsics." "Rockets. Planes, and Other
I lungs thai Fly." "('.reating Web Pages"
and "Fun With I.ic|tiid Nitrogen."
\le\ (.arroll. .i sophomore majoring
in civil and environmental engineer
ing, is the other coordinatoi lor Fx
ploiing New Wot Ids this veai. She cle
sc nhes the dav as a "hands-on intro
dtic lion to sc ic nee and engineering."
She also hopes the\ will gain .in idea
about the engineei s role in societv."[Kn
gineeis| build the bridges that mommy
and dadch drive ac ross evervdav," (.ar
roll said, referring to the competition,
lirenna I learn, a sophomore Soci

etv <>1 Women Engineers officer who
coordinated invitations, echoed these
sentiments. "The thing we hope they
come away with is excitement about en
gineering, wit U an idea about engineer
ing and math outside the textbook,"
she said.
Maggie Montgomery, a senior ma
joring in civil and environmental engi
neering, coordinated the event last
year and is organizing the competition
this year.
"It's really fun to see kids get excited
about math and science," Montgomery
said. "That's the whole point ot the pro
gram â€” that you're not just doing
equations from the book."
She-Rae ( hen, a senior electrical en
gineering major, helped put on the
event two years ago. " The kids are so
much fun," said ('.hen. who is also pub
licit\ ( bait lor the Society of Women
Engineers. " I'hey really enjoy the
event."
According to I learn, nearly every
thing, including transportation for the
students to Stanford, breakfast and
lunch, is donated or bought with do
nated funds from local sponsors.
Carroll said she believes the pro
gram is a worthy cause. "We hope it
keeps growing and more and more stu
dents have the opportunity to come,"
she said.
