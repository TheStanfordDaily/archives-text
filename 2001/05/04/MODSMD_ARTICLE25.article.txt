WASHINGTON (AP) —The cornerstone
of President George W. Bush's education legis
lation survived its first challenge yesterday as a
I louse committee signaled support for annual
reading and math tests for millions of'elemen
tary .nut junior high sc hoolers.
I he vote in the House Education Commit
tee came as the Senate began debate on a
painstakingly negotiated companion measure
with a unanimous vote to spend $120 billion
more for children with disabilities than Bush
recommended over the next decade.
"We owe our children no less," said Sen.
James Jeffords, R-Vermont, a longtime advo
cate of inc leased funding for the program.
Taken together, the developments in both
houses of Congress reflected a gathering mo
mentum behind the education legislation at
the top of the administration's agenda.

"The only way for parents to know for cer
tain whether their children are learning is to
measure, and measure regularly. The commit
tee today stood firmly with the president and
endorsed his plan to test students and empow
er parents," said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio,
chairman of the 1 louse Education (Committee.
Rep. Betty McCollum, l)-Minn., offered an
amendment to scuttle the system of annual
reading and math tests tor third through
eighth graders. I he tests would be used to mea
sure the progress schools make in increasing
student achievement.
Republican conservatives have grumbled
about that aspect of the president's program,
particularly in light of a committee vote
Wednesday that stripped out a private school
voucher provision for students stuck in fail
ing schools.

" llle only reason conservatives arc willing to
tolerate testing is because it is Ixilanced with tlexi
bilitv and choice," said Rep. Boh Schafter, R
(lolo. "The value of testing has always been to em
power pat ents. Now pat ents havel)een c iit out of
the lull."
But McCollinn's amendment failed on a
voice vote after supporters declined even to
seek .1 roll call, customarily an acknowledg
ment that defeat is inevitable.
