sioner Mar\ Robinson expressed
hope the United States "will re
turn speedily as a member of the
commission," spokesman |ose

leased in (ieneva.
" I he United States of America

has made a historic contribution to
the Commission on Human
Rights," the statement said, noting
that the first I .S. representative
on the bodv, Eleanor Roosevelt,
"helped shape the commission
and its vision of an International
bill of I luman Rights."
Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of
President Franklin 1). Roosevelt,
was an earlv supporter of the I nit
ed Nations.
Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., a
membei of the I .S. delegation to
the commission, blamed the U.S.
defeat on a failed effort to have
China censured for its human
rights record. The move "exacer
bated the resentment" among
other commission members.
"Even friends in Western Eu
rope would rather we just looked
the other way when it comes to
human rights in China," he said,
adding that it comes down to the
importance of trade. "It's all
about money."
