## Men set to face Cal in Big Meet 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's big. It's heated. And it's tra
dition. But, most importantly, it's
only gone Stanford's wav once in
the past 29 years.
Though recently the Stanford
men's track team has been a na
tional powerhouse, garnering
first or second in the nation tor
tlie past three years, California
lias continued to be a thorn in the
('.animal's side.
Only fifth-year seniors can re
call Stanford's last victory over the
Golden Bears, an eight-point
squeaker in 1997. Since then, the
point mat gin has never been larg
er than 21, but it has always been
in (lal's favor.
" The Big Meet embodies what
college athletics should be about,"
C.al coach I buy Sandoval said.
"Every point, every place, everv ef
fort counting â€” there's enthusi
asm .uul magic that happens in the
Big Meet that I don't think, there is
any place else in the country."
Tomorrow, the l()7th Big Meet
will be held at Stanford, as the ('ar
dinal tries to reduce its deficit to
Gal, which boasts a 63-41-2 overall
advantage in the rivalry.
Equipped with two Olympians,

five athletes in the top five nation
ally and 19 in the top five of the Pa
cific 10 Conference, Stanford has
the prowess, but, unfortunately
for the ('.ardinal, so does (lal.
Stanford has dominated the
Pac-10 in the 1,500 this season and
sits at first, third and fifth. (b-cap
tain Michael Stember (3:41.80)
leads the way, while freshman
Donald Sage (3:43.03) and red
si ii r t freshman Seth Hejny
(3:44.79) aren't far behind, but the
('.ardinal trio will be c hallenged by
Gal's Bolota Asmerom, who holds
the second ranking with a time of
three minutes, 42.73 seconds.
The Gardinal will also have to
contend with Asmerom in the
5,000. I he Golden Bear leads the
conference with 13:31.88, but
Stanford can apply pressure with
its third-, fourth- and fifth-ranked
runners in Hejny (13:46.81), red
shirt junior jonathon Riley
(13:51.68) and sophomore Louis
Luchini (13:52.87).
On the field, sophomore Mil
ton Little, leading the conference
in the long jump, will have to fend
off Gal's Robert Kennedy, who is
only one-half inch off of Little's 25-
4 career best and won the- meet last
