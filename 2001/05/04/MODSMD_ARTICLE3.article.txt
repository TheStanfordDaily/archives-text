### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Provost |ohn Ktchemendv announced
ili.it Ik' was slowing down the proposed
merger of the six departments that com
prise the Division ol Literatures, C.ultures
and Languages at vesterdav's I'ac tilt\ Sen
ate meeting.
"I took aw,i\ from the senate meeting
the feeling that we should slow down the
proposal ... I his is not act it it ism of the
proposal, which is < learl\ ver\ good, but
I'm not sure that it's exactlx light,"
I n hemeiuU said.
Kt( hetneiuh stressed that the status quo
was not .111 option, hut that otliei proposals
would he considered.
I he provost .innounced that he is as
sembling a Blue Rihhon ('.onunission, with
members both m and outside the division,
to investigate the proposal. I he committee
will report bat k to him and future Dean <>l
the I lumanities and Si icnt es Sharon 1 .ong
at the end of fall quarter of next vear.
I lit- Faculty Senate also reauthorized
the interdisi iplinarv program m American
St i it lies lor three veai s.

Interdisciplinary programs that are
doing well are normally reauthorized tor
five vears. In a few extraordinary cases,
programs have been reauthorized foi
eight. But members of the senate said the)
wished to send a message to American
Studies that it needs to improve its pro
gram by onl\ reauthorizing it for three.
" 1 his program came up five years ago. It
had problems, and it got a five-year exten
sion. Now it li.is come up again: A tlnee
vear extension would send the program a
necessary wake-up call," said Statistics Prof.
Brad Kfbrn.
He also noted that, years ago, when
human biology — an interdisciplinary pro
gram he is involved 111 — was faltering, it
u.is reauthorized for onlv three years.
When it was next reviewed, it had ad
dressed many kev problems and was reau
thorized for eight years because it had l»e
-< nine so curricularlv strong.
Religious Studies Prof. Hester tlelber,
chair of the (lonunittee on Undergraduate
Studies, spoke about the importance of the
field of American Studies and pointed out
several areas of possible improvement for
the interdisciplinary program.
" 1 lie program needs to redefine its mis
sion. intellectual rationale, and it needs to
excite the faculty," she said. "American
Studies needs to be recreated [at Stanford]."
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, director
of the intct dis< iplin.n \ program in
American Studies, objected to the
( haraeteri/ation of Ins program as fal
tering.
"In the last two vears, numbers in
the program have gone up." he s.iid.
" I he claim that lecturers handle a lot
of the cote (lasses is a widespread
problem throughout the I niversitv."
Ucrnstein also characterized the
thrcc-vcar proposal as a "Draconian
sword" hanging over the program's
head—discouraging faculty from be
coming invested in the interdiscipli
narv program and c ausing some noted
Americanists to turn down the pro
gram's directorship.
In other senate business, the lit si
patt of <i two-part report on the I ni
versit\'s writing requirement was
presented.
I nder the proposal, students ad
mitted in the spring of 200 I would re
ceive no Advanced Placement credit
based exemption from the writing re
quirement. Instead, all students would
be required to take one writing ( lass in
both the freshman and sophomore

vein's, in addition lo the writing in the
Nlajot I <.'< |l 111 CI i hi 11.
11*( 1111 i( ally, this is not increasing
ic(jiiiicincnts, (>elbei s.ud. "Depart
ments could .ilso implement their
ow n < ont ses.
One noted problem with the cur
rent writing requirement is th.it a
nuinhet ol students dcla\ t.iking the
re(|iiired courses until their senior
veat.
"We have I 10 seniors taking their
nominal heshm.in-level writing require
ment," Vice Provost lot I ndergtadnate
l\d uc.it ion |< >lm Br.iMn.in said.
"We would look to the Registrar's
Office lot strong enforcement [ol the
new i etjniretnent]," Linguistics Prof.
Kli/aheth liangott said. "Students
should not he allowed to register if thev
don't t.ike these tonrscs hv the end of
their sophomore veat."
Bi.imii.iii said that this proposal
would benefit s< ience and engineering
students, who have Advanced Place
ment credit in hnglish less frequently
than humanities students. These stu
dents, who often have large numbers
of prerequisites to take during their
freshman year, would be allowed to
wait until their sophomore year to t.ike
one of their writing courses.
Finally, the senate authorized an

mastei s program in Symbolic Systems.
"Symbolic Systems was treated in
19S(). .ind many students who do un
dergraduate work in it would like to
move on to a master s-level degree in
the same area," Registrar Roger Print
up said.
We expect quite a number of stu
dents to apply [to the master's pro
gram].' Linguistics Prof. Ivan Sag said.
However, support for the program
was not unanimous.
We need to ask ourselves: Do we
want professional master's degree pro
grams at all." What do we want with our
limited resources and headcounts?"
said Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Hrauman.
Would you trade some of your
Ph.D. students for these students?" he
asked.
Initially, the program will be open
only to Stanford students who plan
to be coterminal students in it, or
Stanford graduates who wish to re
ceive a master's in the field. Program
administrators anticipated that 10 to
12 students who are interested will
be admitted to the program.
I he Faculty Senate will next meet
on May I ~ in the Law School, when the
writing requirement report will be
completed and voted on.
