### BECKY BLANCHARD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the past three weeks, the Sum
ford women's track and field athletes
have put on <|iiite a show, ac < umulating
individual honors and personal hests,
.Hid individually qualifying lot postsea
son competition.
But tomorrow at Cobb Track & An
gell Field, when the( lardinal women col
lect their accolades, they lido it asa team.
In the 22nd installment of a ( lassie
Bay Area rivalry, Stanford and Cali
fornia will battle on the track and in
the field to see which squad will c laim
this year's Big Meet title. I hough the
Cardinal women have an I 1-10 edge
in the series, the Golden Bears used
strong performances in the jumps and
sprints to claim their first victory since
1996 in last year's meet at Berkeley's
Edwards Stadium.
No matter the winner, c oaches from
both teams are quick to recognize the
value they see in the dual-meet team
competition — a format growing less

common as elite collegiate programs

profile meets and qualifying athletes to

"I think [big Meet] embodies what
college athletics should he about
and that is people putting on the line
every point and even plat e with even

big Meet histon shows that compet
ing foi one's team often tlraws out ath
letes' best performances — not to
mention an enthusiastic crowd. Ibis
year's big Meet is expected to lill the
bleat hers with about 3,000 fans.
Spectators should witness a bal
anced battle for the women's title, with
both teams coining ofl confidence
building performances last weekend.
The (Cardinal broke the s< liool ret on I
in the IxHOO and brought home two
runner-up finishes from the presti
gious Perm Relays. I lie ('.al women
posted a second-place team finish in
the California / Nevada State Meet.
Riding the momentum of those per

formances into the weekend, athletes
from both teams will be able to shilt
thcil concentration from individual
highlights to team glory.
" I best* kids are very excited about
the meet, about doing well." Stanford
women's head coach Kdrick Moreal
said. "Kveryone will make sacrifices to
support their teammates and support
their school."
Stanford will draw much of its
strength from its distance and midtlle
distancc harriers. I lie Cardinal boasts
five of the top 10 conference competi
tors in the 5,000 meters ;rtitl has already
qualified 12 runners to the Pat-10 meet
in the 1,500 meters. Cal's top hope in
the distance events is junior Mariel
S< hluetter, who bettered her own
school record (10 minutes, 44.95 sec
onds) in the 3,000-meter steeplechase
last weekend at the California / Nevada
meet. She will challenge Stanford's own
record-holder, junior Laura I inner,
whose time going into the meet is a
mere seven-tenths of a second faster.
Last year, the Golden Bears relied
bea\ ilv on their athletes in the field for
big points in their H2 2/3-79 1/3 deci
sion. I his year, they will again count on
thrower Dana Lawson, a NCAA provi
sional qualifier in the discus (173 feet)
and hammer (IH9-11) and an automat

ic qualifier in shot put (53-7). However,
Stanford has brought depth and talent
to its lineup with the addition of fresh
men |illian Camarena and Jessica
Pluth. Plutli, who unleashed a throw of
187-0 at the Stanford Invitational, will
challenge Lawson and NCAA automat
it qualifier |ennifer Joyce in the ham
mer. Camarena is just a foot behind
Lawson in the shot put.
I he probable absence of Golden
bears star Reyntla King because of an
injury suffered at the California/Neva
da meet will diminish the field in the
horizontal jumps, where King — a 42-
foot triple-jumper — was expected to
dominate. With top honors in long and
triple jump wide open, ('.ardinal senior
|ulie Tinker, who will compete in next
weekend's Pat-10 heptathlon champi
onship. will look fora breakthrough
performance in her final big Meet. She
u ill also compete in the 4x 100 relay and
possibly the 4x1,600 relay.
"Mv [personal record in long jump]
is 19-TO right now, and I'm just really
feeling that I'm tin the brink of really
doing great things in it," Tinker said. "I
want to use this opportunity to do that,
and it'll be my first time triple jumping
this season. I kind of feel like 1 have

Other kev matt Imps between
the two squads include the 100 me

While first-plate finishes grab
headlines, second- and third
plate finishes also earn important
team points in the dual-meet for

"I think, in the spirit of'compe
tition, we reallv try not to worry
about times and distances and just
try to focus on our competitors
and trying to figure out a way to
outdo them," Mortal said. "1 think
if you get caught up in that, von re
alize that performance is some
thing that's accomplished once it's

about vour performance in a meet,
vou kind of miss the whole glory,
the whole colorfulness of being a
competitor, of not knowing what
you're going to get, but just tun
