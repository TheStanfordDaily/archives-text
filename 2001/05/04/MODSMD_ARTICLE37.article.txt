Florida vote leaves election in doubt
NASHVILLF, Fenn.— I lie champagne
had been popped in Austin. Gov. George \V.
Bush had grac iousb accepted a concession
(.ill from Vice President Al Gore. Network
anchors were already constructing hypo
thetical bush cabinets.
Ilien, at about 2:45 a.m. GST, under a
steady rain, in the most improbable of elec

tions, Gore Gampaign Chairman bill Daly
uttered the most improbable of words: "()ur
campaign continues!"
\ series of stunning developments early
this morning centering around the unre
solved vote count in Florida has left the na
tion without a president-elect and left ob
servers around the country astonished at
the inconceivable closeness of this ele( tion.
More than an hour after all major net
wot ks had projected Bush as the winner of
Florida, and therefore the election, Florida
officials released Figures showing the race to
be too c lose to call, leading Gore to retract
his earlier concession and putting the elec -
tion's outcome in doubt.

Students protested in front of Old Union against the possible merger of six
departments, the recent incidents of hate graffiti and the underfunding of
community centers (April 20, 2001).
French and Italian, Cerman
Studies, Slavic Languages and
Literatures and Spanish and
Portuguese.
I ndei the proposal, the divi
sion would retain us current
name, but each of tlu' six de
partments would become an
area under the departmental
leadership of the division.
It consolidated, the division
would offer new majors, recruit
five more senior fac nltv and free
department heads to teach and
research. However, some stu
dents and facultv contend that
dissolving the current depart
ments would cause a loss of de
partmental identitv and would
result in inferior scholarship.
