steady rain, in the most improbable of elec

uttered the most improbable of words: "()ur
campaign continues!"
\ series of stunning developments early
this morning centering around the unre
solved vote count in Florida has left the na
tion without a president-elect and left ob
servers around the country astonished at
the inconceivable closeness of this ele( tion.
More than an hour after all major net
wot ks had projected Bush as the winner of
Florida, and therefore the election, Florida
officials released Figures showing the race to
be too c lose to call, leading Gore to retract
his earlier concession and putting the elec -
tion's outcome in doubt.
