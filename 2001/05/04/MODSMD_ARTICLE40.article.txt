Stanford corrals Ixnighorns, up
ends No. 5 Texas, 27-24
Remember this date: Sept. If>,
2000.
For the remaining three years
of his college career. Chris Lewis
will look ba< k fondly on Sept. Hi
as the day he came of age as a Di
vision I quarterback.
The numbers he put up
weren't pretty: 12-for-M, 214
yards. Some of the passes weren't
either. Lewis won't remember
that, though — the onlv thing
he'll remember is that special feel
ing that comes only after leading
the Stanford football team to a
come-from-bchind 27-24 win
over then No. 5 Texas.

Senior Hyman shocks Sydney
and herself, wins gold
SYDNKY, Australia (Al*) —
Met round cheeks glowing, her
blue eyes sparkling, Stanford se
nior Misty llynian popped out of
the water so full of joy atnd so
thoroughly stunned that she had
to look at the scoreboard three
times to make sure she won.
"Oh, my Cod! I don't believe
it." she said over and over
Wednesday as she saw her time, 2
minutes, 5.88 seconds, an
Olympic record in the 200-meter
butterfly, and her name ahead of
Susie O'Neill, Australia's
"Madame Butterfly," the defend
ing ()lvmpic champion and world
record holder.
No one could believe it. espe
cially Hyman, who almost quit
swimming in May. But on the
podium, she couldn't stop beam
ing, even as she sang the "Star-
Spangled Banner" with her hand
on her heart and the gold medal

around her neck.

Cardinal wins one Mcx>re Big Game
Starting the third ccnturv of
the Big Game, it was fitting to add
a new twist to the series' wackv
and storied history. But, unlike
the infamous Play of 1082, there
were no trombone players miss
ing a shoestring tackle, and there
was no ('.al victory. Saturday in
Berkeley, it was just a simple, in
delible pass to the fullback th.it
gave Stanford a thrilling !W-30
overtime victory.
With the game — and Bay
Area respec i on the line, Stan
ford dug into the inner sanctum
of its playbook and uncovered a
device not used since last season.
()n second down in tlu- first peri
od of overtime, junior quarter*
back Randy Fasani faked a hand
ofl to junior fullback (lasey Moore
and then dropped back to pass.
Moore c barged throough the line
and found himself uncovered bv
the Cal secondary. Fasani

promptly threw him the ball in
stride as Moore waltzed un
touched into the end zone.

thanks to a loss by top-ranked
Michigan State.
