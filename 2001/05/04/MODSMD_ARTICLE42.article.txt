# Commencement in Opinions
## The
						Stanford Daily Commencement speaker choice reasonable 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )I

FOR THREE AND a hall years, this
year's seniors have looked over the
cadre of highly successful and in
fluential people who have ad
dressed previous graduating classes and
wondered who they would have for their
ceremony. When this year's speaker, daily
Fiorina, chief executive officer of 1 lewlett-
Packard, was announced, many on cam
pus let out an exasperated sigh or, worse,
rushed to their computer or phone to log
a hasty message to whomever would lis
ten. lilt* situation has been handled rep
rehensibly by all sides, and that has unfor
tunately dwarfed the excitement sur
rounding the selection of a qualified and
important woman to be Commencement
speaker.
Most of the e-mails that circulated in re
sponse to Fiorina's selection focused on
the technological aspect of her job, which
many students say caters to the technolog
ical section of campus. While this knee
jerk reaction seems correct, closer exami
nation of Fiorina's background reveals an
impressive, well-rounded woman behind

the computers. Fiorina focused her stud
ies on tlu* humanities as a Stanford under
graduate, yet she works in a technical
field. This combination gives her a unique
perspective that many Stanford students
can relate to in their own forays into the
working world.
Perusing the list of famous Stanford
graduates, Fiorina certainly belongs on it.
As the (1E() of one of the world's most suc
cessful companies, she is considered one
of the most powerful women in the busi
ness world. She is also a Stanford graduate
who majored in philosophy and medieval
studies. I ler list of accomplishments easily
warrants consideration for the prestigious
honor of speaking at (loinmeiuement.
While Stanford and Silicon Valley have
been transformed by the technological
revolution. Commencement speakers
have not always reflected this change. In
the past four years, none of the speakers
had a technical 01 business background.
Stanford rests at the crossroads of re
search in both the humanities and the
technological fields, and Fiorina is a pel -

son specially qualified to comment on
Stanford's unique position in this ( hang
ing world.
Another of the complaints leveled
against the choice centered on the prox
imity of Hewlett-Packard to Stanford.
I lewlett-Packard may he a local company,
but it has business interests throughout
the world and stands prominently as the
par exemplar of philanthropic and social
excellence in the business world, giving
billions ol dollars to charitable organiza
tions and funds that bring much-needed
aid to the world. Fiorina has stated that
one ol her goals is to continue the compa
ny's rich tradition of philanthropic work
throughout the world.
I he student body should also relied on
its own actions during this debate. From
the moment the speaker was announced,
e-mails Hooded in with inspired frenzy.
Kxpressing discontent and confusion, the
e-mails failed to address underlying emo
tions and feelings. Many of the complaints
not-so-subtly danced around the basic
feeling: disappointment that we didn't get

someone better. I he e-mails, while not di
rectly stating that Fiorina was not good
enough, expressed feelings of entitlement
and expectation that usually hide stealth
ily below the Stanford Foothills.
If Oxford gets Michael [ackson and
Harvard gets Bono, then, because we are
better than Harvard and Oxford —or
any other school —we should get God
himself. But, if he's busy, then we'll settle
fora former president or world leader, but
only this year. The lack of clear and consis
tent objections to Fiorina found in the
complaints demonstrate an arrogance
that is disappointing and unbecoming of
Stanford students.
Students should look forward to Fiori
na's speech. She is an impressive woman
who graduated 112 rom Stanford and is CK()
of a world-class company. While there
might always be someone considered "bet
ter'' out there, we should be more appre
ciative of Fiorina's accomplishments and
the resulting wisdom she could impart
upon us.
