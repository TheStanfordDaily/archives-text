# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Seniors 'take a little Stanford' 
### PETER DOUGLAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
When 1 decided to attend Stanford, the deci
sion was not one with which 1 was wholly satis
fied. Growing up in Maryland, I had virtually
never heard of Stanford, and, when I had, it was
always as the "MI I of the West." As an aspiring
ac tor, as well as an avid ac ademic, I feared that
Stanford would sate only half my passion.
fwo voices clarified my thoughts on the mat
ter. One was that of Michael kahn, the artistic
director of Washington's Shakespeare Theatre
and I he juilliard School who essentially told me
that 1 would never be so sure of myself as a per
son or well-equipped as an intellectual ac tor il 1
did not begin my career with an excellent liber
al-arts education. I lie other was tli.it of my par-

ents, who reasoned that I should
not underestimate the impor
tance of "the college experi
ence" in one's development and
maturation. As Commencement
approaches, I reflect on these
four years and reali/e how right
both voices were.
1 hope that on Commence
ment Day .ill of us will be able to
reflect on our time here and feel

more confident in our abilities and more well
equipped as intellectuals in whatever fields we
end up working. I think many of us often take it
for granted, but the Stanford education is un
like that of any other university. From our first
years on campus, studying the humanities in
CIV, receiving individual attention through in
depth Freshman-Sophomore Seminars and
pursuing our favorite intellectual and artistic
pursuits through the summers with the help of
Undergraduate Research Opportunities grants,
we have been experiencing the finest under
graduate education in the world.
Even by the very nature of its academic year
(divided into quarters rather than semesters),
Stanford challenges and demands more focus of
its undergraduates. As we progressed into our
years as upperclassmen, we found opportunities
for one-on-one interaction with professors
through independent studies and directed read
ings and the unique option to obtain a master's
degree through only one or two additional years.
Now that we are completing our time here,
we have the opportunity to take advantage of an

incredibly devoted, diverse and successful
alumni network. 1 hope also tli.it we will all
leave here with a deep appreciation lot out "col
lege experience." This has been a very shel
tered, transitional period, in which we have
been granted some time as young adults to ma
ture, play and take a deep breath before walking
out onto the stage of the "real world." Here,
again, we have been particularly fortunate. Our
social scene is not based on bccr-gu/zling fra
ternity parties or .111 overwhelming Creek sys
tem. Nor is it at all like- tli.it of MI I , where the
Math Club might just be the best available "so
cial'" outlet. As we have a well-balanced academ
ic scene, so, too, do we have a diverse and non
homogenous social scene.
Ol course, like- any human institution or
community, Stanford isn't perfect, but I'm
sure the people who live and study here in the
future will continue working to make it so, as
we consciously or subconsciously have. At the
same time, we cannot help — 1 also hope —
but have a deep nostalgia for this place and
these years. Indeed, every day I talk with se
niors who frantically wish they had a little
more time at Stanford.
But we must remember what our leaving
Stanford symbolizes. In casual conversation,
many of us speak of our upcoming "gradua
tion," but Stanford calls it "Commencement,"
and there exists an important difference. A
graduation is defined by Webster's as the "con
ferral or receipt of an academic degree or
diploma marking completion of studies." Con
versely, a commencement is defined as "a be
ginning, a start."
Rather than consider June 17 as the day on
which this wonderful experience as Stanford
students comes to an end, let us view it as the
day on which we begin our new lives as Stanford
alumni, as people blessed to have had the best
undergraduate education and experience that
exists and who now have so much more to con
tribute to the world at large than when we first
arrived. I.et us all try to make the future spheres
in which we live a little- more like this university.
We cannot stay at Stanford, but we may take a
little Stanford with us when we go.
