### 
Editor's Note: This letter was origi
nally em ulated as an open letter to
President Hennessy and the senior
elass presidents. It appeared in the
April 2, 2(101, edition of The Daily
and was signed by 13 students.
We've spoken with many of our
senior friends; many do not feel
that they can relate to ( arly Fiori
na's experiences and do not think
that they are as broad as past speak
ers' experiences.
We have a few questions to ask
and requests to make. For one, we
think those of us who nominated
individuals on the Web site the se
nior c lass presidents set up for the
purpose of finding a (Commence
ment speaker deserve to know who
the l()()-plus nominees were, and
who were the 10 finalists submitted
on a list to University President
John I knnessy.
***
Secondly, we think the senior
< lass presidents are our representa

lives. We elected them. I lierefbre,
when we received the message via e
mail that they are simply the mes
sengers of 1 lennessy in announcing
the selection of the (lommencement
sjx'aker, and that we should redirect
any complaints alxnit that selection
directly to I lennessy, we felt In-reft of
representation and .1 foe used voice.
***
To Hcnncssy, we appreciate that
you must be flooded with commu
nications. \V'c think it is Mike Kass,
Lauren Robertson, Delphinc Inert
and Brandon Maughan's duty to
follow through on .til the aspects of
the selection of a Commencement
speaker that they can. 1 hat said,
kass's e-mail [to the senior class]
seemed to indicate that the four of
them are done working on this.
Finally, we appreciate all of the
work the class presidents and I len
nessy have put into selecting a
Commencement speaker, and we
are impressed with Fiorina's
achievements. But we would like to
point out the conscious or uncon
scious message the selection of Fio
rina sends out. Because of her lead

ership position at Hewlett Packard,
<1 company with unique affiliations
to this University and to the revolu
tionary industry begun in Silicon
Valley, the selection of Fiorina to
speak at our Commencement ties
that company and industry more
tightly to our University communi
ty. Whether you look at this as good
or bad, it is not neutral.
Fvcn those of us who can Ix'tter
relate to the experiences of Fiorina
wish we .ill had a more public figure
speaking at our Commencement.
While someone like Kofi Annan, for
instance, may Ik- more geared to
those interested in international af
fairs and human rights, he is ac c us
tomed and invited to speak for
widely diverse audiences. The same
could be- said for past speakers like
the American Poet laureate Rolxrt
Pinskv. While Fiorina may lx- as in
fluential as these other figures, we
do not know her as a figure who
speaks out to address public issues.
Kspecially at (bmmencement, at
which .ill graduating students come
together, the choice of a sjxaker with
the s|>enfic exjx'iience of Fiorina is
glaringlv tin-inclusive in its appeal.
