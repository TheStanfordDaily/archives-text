# Oscar committee too quality-blind

### RAMIN SETOODEH STAFF WRITER 
Fhere are things, 1 contend,
that escape ihe grasp of reason.
I do not understand why, lor ex
ample, executives pav Freddie
Prin/e |r. the big bucks to star in
mindless movies that In ing in luke
warm receptions .it the box ollice. I
do not understand win we contin
ue to call a land that is not green
(ireenland and .1 land Ih.lt is not ic \
Iceland. And I do not understand
why millions ol people ac ross the
nation kill millions ol brain cells
evcrv day by tuning in to "llollv
wootl Squares" — quite possibh
the worst game show ever created
in the historv ot the human race.
but, alas, I digress.
l hc real kicker that has plagued
me tor the past nine davs is this:
How, 011. how has "Oladiator," a
mediocre summer popcorn Ilick,
positioned itsell liont and centei to
take home the Acadcmv Award lor
best pic ture on Oscar night? Why,
oil, whv are people praising Russell
Crowe's lackadaisical perfor
mance? (He snagged an Oscar
nomination tor Best Actor). What,
oh, what is so stellar about )oaquin
Phoenix's turn as a villain who
starts hitting on his own sister? (I le,
dear reader, snatched a nod tor
Best Supporting Actor).
In tact, when the Oscar nomi
nations were announced on Feb.
13 — and alter all the dust from
the massacre had settled — "(ilad
iator" ended tip as the front-run
ner with a total ot 12 nominations.
Creat Caesar's Chost. somebody
demand a recount!
Don't get me wrong: When the
special effects extravaganza
opened last May, I held a mildh
positive opinion of the movie. It
was blight and lw>lcl. with stunning
sound effects and brash backdrops.
I towever, it was also released 111 the
midst of such duds as "Battlefield
Earth," "Centei Stage" and "Mis
sion Impossible: 2." Perhaps even a
David Spade movie would have
looked good at the time.
On <1 second viewing, I liked the
movie even less. (Note to the Acade
my: (iood films usually play even

hcttci the sec one I lime around). I lie
storyline was a muddle of tangled
subplots. I lie lead performances
wavered in the background of all
those bloody battle scenes. And the
final confrontation between ( rowe

the laws of logic. not to mention the

Fhere are things, 1 contend,
that escape ihe grasp of reason.
I do not understand why, lor ex
ample, executives pav Freddie
Prin/e |r. the big bucks to star in
mindless movies that In ing in luke
warm receptions .it the box ollice. I
do not understand win we contin
ue to call a land that is not green
(ireenland and .1 land Ih.lt is not ic \
Iceland. And I do not understand
why millions ol people ac ross the
nation kill millions ol brain cells
evcrv day by tuning in to "llollv
wootl Squares" — quite possibh
the worst game show ever created
in the historv ot the human race.
but, alas, I digress.
l hc real kicker that has plagued
me tor the past nine davs is this:
How, 011. how has "Oladiator," a
mediocre summer popcorn Ilick,
positioned itsell liont and centei to
take home the Acadcmv Award lor
best pic ture on Oscar night? Why,
oil, whv are people praising Russell
Crowe's lackadaisical perfor
mance? (He snagged an Oscar
nomination tor Best Actor). What,
oh, what is so stellar about )oaquin
Phoenix's turn as a villain who
starts hitting on his own sister? (I le,
dear reader, snatched a nod tor
Best Supporting Actor).
In tact, when the Oscar nomi
nations were announced on Feb.
13 — and alter all the dust from
the massacre had settled — "(ilad
iator" ended tip as the front-run
ner with a total ot 12 nominations.
Creat Caesar's Chost. somebody
demand a recount!
Don't get me wrong: When the
special effects extravaganza
opened last May, I held a mildh
positive opinion of the movie. It
was blight and lw>lcl. with stunning
sound effects and brash backdrops.
I towever, it was also released 111 the
midst of such duds as "Battlefield
Earth," "Centei Stage" and "Mis
sion Impossible: 2." Perhaps even a
David Spade movie would have
looked good at the time.
On <1 second viewing, I liked the
movie even less. (Note to the Acade
my: (iood films usually play even

hcttci the sec one I lime around). I lie
storyline was a muddle of tangled
subplots. I lie lead performances
wavered in the background of all
those bloody battle scenes. And the
final confrontation between ( rowe
and Phoenix seemed to violate all
the laws of logic. not to mention the
laws of pin sics. (I had a beitei time
believing thai I oni (anise could
dangle in mid-ait during that rex k
climbing sc cue in "Ml:2').
Now, onh about a month until
Oscar night, "Gladiator" looks
rcaclv to storm the competition.
Wliv do 1 think the.- Ridley Scott-cli
rect eel popcorn flick will pick up
the award ten best Picture? Let nic
count the three Roman reasons:
I. Like I said before, "Gladiator"
raked in a total ol 12 nominations.
PheAcadeim is notorious foi shov
ing the award in the clirec lion of the
film that snags the most nods (think
of such recent examples as "Ameri
can Hcaniv." "Shakespeare in Lo\e"
and "Titanic"). We're looking at a
sweeping slaughter coming om wav.

"(ilacliator" hues slim competi

nominated lor Hest Picture are bel
ter in both quality and style than
"Gladiator," they aren't what the
Academ\ voters look lor. Most peo
ple agree that "(Ihcxolat" shouldn't
