Somewhere between Molly Ringwald's
G-rated kiss with Andrew McCarthy in
"Pretty in Pink" and the steamy menage-a
trois involving two high school seniors
(Denise Richards and Neve Campbell) and
their guidance counselor (Matt Dillon) in
"Wild Tilings," a metamorphosis of the teen
movie occurred. While Mike Figgis was
"Leaving Las Vegas" and Steven Spielberg
was "Saving Private Ryan," movie studios
were busy pumping out teen exploitation
flicks like there was no tomorrow.
And the publit lias welcomed this resur
gence of pubescent films with open arms. In
its opening weekend, "Save the Last
Dance," a coniing-of-age drama starring 19-
year-old Julia Stiles, blew two-time Oscar
winner Tom I tanks and "Cast Away" out of
the water, capturing the number one spot at
the box office. In 1999, "American Pie," a
teen movie about the art of "getting some"
starring then unknown Jason Higgs,
grossed over $ 100 million.
So. dude — w hat's the deal?
A little over a decade ago, a wildly suc
cessful television producer named Aaron
Spelling got together with a producer and
series creator named Darren Star and con
cocted what would quickly become one of
the most loved and loathed show son televi
sion. This show was called "Heverlv Hills
90210" and was the zygote from which the
rest of the boi n-again teen entertainment
industry would grow and flourish.
"Heverlv Hills 90210" was a long way
from "Our House," the wholesome family
sitcom where Shannen Dohertv got her at t
ing wings opposite oatmeal guru Wilford
Hrimley. Dohertv, along with hair-gelled
heartthrobs Jason Priestly and Luke Perry,
made "90210" the most famous zip code in
the nation and. with the backing of the Fox
network, helped thrust prime-time casual
teenage sex into its living rooms (on the tele
visions — not the couches), the likes of
which had never been seen.
Like an over-fertilized Chia Pet that can't
help but grow, a new-age sexual revolution
snowballed out of Hollywood following the
success of "90210." Hut it didn't play out in
a farmer's field in upstate New York to a
soundtrack backed by Janis Joplin antl jitni
Hcntlrix. This revolution was conceived in
the opulent offices of the major studios and
was captured in front of the lens by Panavi
sion cameras to the tunes of Blink IN2 and
Christina Aguilera.
This new-age revolution, which is as
much about putting highly marketable chest
hair-less young actors and perky-breasted
young actresses on multi-plex screens across
the country as it is about heavily scripted sex
scenes, is a complex beast. The teen angst
borne of "90210" has since been cannibal
ized, cross-fertilized and inbred to create sev
eral subsets of the teen movie.
I he success of Frankie Avalon and An
nette Funicello's "Beach Blanket Bingo"
and "How to Stuff a Wilt! Bikini" almost
four decades ago proved that youth-orient-

Ed comedies at e some of America's most
wanted films. From the infamous "Ferris
Buellei s Day ()fl" to "Better (Ml Dead" and
from "License to Drive" to "American Pie,"
box office numbers attest that a significant
amount of monev is being generated by this
flavor of film.
I < >dav's teen comedies are populated by a
new breed of actors, among them Freddie
Prinze Jr., Stiles and Ryan Phillippc. Indeed,
it appears that somebody kidnapped the Brat
Pack and replaced it with the "Ail-That" Pack.
**♦
()ne such subset is the teen slasher film,
which has had a rebirth of late. The early
'90s saw the "Friday the 13th" franchise
beat a dead horse by releasing the forget
table ninth film in its long running saga of
Jason, the serial killer who changed the
way America thought about summer camp
forever. Famous for both their gory vio
lence antl flagrant display of skin, the teen
horror movies of yore laughed in the face
of good taste and played to an audience
that thirsted for large doses of blood and
other bodily lluitls.
However, in 1996, with the release of
Wes ('.raven's "Scream," things changed.
Writer Kevin Williamson (the man behind
TV's "Dawson's Creek") created a clever
storyline that would spawn two sequels and
serve to resuscitate a sub-genre that had all
but disappeared from the nation's movie
screens. "St ream" was less about exploiting
its young stars than it was about challenging
the way audiences thought about screamer
movies. ()ne of the characters even explains
the "rules that one must abide by in order
to successfully survive a horror movie," m
thiding, "you can never have sex. Sex
equals death."
On the heels of "Scream" was "Urban
Legend." along with Williamson's "1
Know What You Did Last Summer,"
which featured Jennifer Love Hewitt's

chest alongside the highly marketable
Freddie Prinze Jr. and wannabe it-girl and
"Butty the Vampire Slayer" star Sarah
Michelle Gellar. These new films are com
monly smarter and scarier than their pre
decessors which, in some cases, is not say
ing much (remember "The Howling"?).
And, although it is hard not to overlook
the overt use of young, buxom female stars
in this genre, it is merely on par with cur
rent industry trends.
So how do people really feel about the so
called teen movie invasion? It's easy to dis
miss these films as sophomoric and unim
portant. but the fact is that they are much
more marketable than various big-budget
films starring recognizable faces that are not
quite as green as those populating the teen
movie scene. Ihe indomitable disposable
income of the teenager is unquestionable.
***
But is this really a surprise? Is this really
a reflection of the so-called demoralization
of society? So masturbation and sexual de
bauchery have become old hat for today's
teen films. So what? Society has progressed
significantly in the past, century in terms of
its sexual comfort level. A sexual liberation
has swept over society, and teenagers aren't
the only ones who have been affected.
It then becomes the question of which
came first: I he sexually charged teen movie
or the sexually charged teen? It probably
goes both ways. In truth, the film industry
and society have a symbiotic relationship:
Films reflect the s<x iety from which they are
generated, and society can't help but be in
fluenced by the stories that are depicted on
the silver screen.
The bottom line is that these movies
make studios lots of money.
And, after all, in the words of one of
today's sizzling young stajs, "If it's not
broke, they're not going to fix it."
