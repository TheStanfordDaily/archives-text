Mam lieo/ile at Stanford struggle to be
the paragon oj perfection, but the fad is
that many of us face personal issues that
are difficult to pice without the help of
others. I he purpose of science is to ad
vance Immunity, and the science of
mental health strives to do the same.
(irief is a concept so nebulous
that, even in the realm of psychol
ogy, it is In definition vague and
unique to each individual, l o be
sure, the grieving period usually
follows the death of someone close
to the griever. but death is not a
necessary ingredient in the recipe;

anv loss of something subjectiveh
experienced In the griever as sig
nificant can prompt .1 grieving pe
riod. For example, it is under
standable to mourn at the end of a
relationship 01 the destruction of
an heirloom.
('.rief is different for everyone.
It seems obvious, then, that "any
thing goes" when it comes to
mourning. I nfortunately, being
accepting of individual differ
ences in grieving is easier said
than done. It can be ver\ hard to
allow yourself to express whatever
feelings vou may encounter when
grieving. Keep that in mind as
vou experience grief yourself or
have friends who are grieving. A
supportive person will be accept
ing of anv wa\ the griever chooses
to mourn.
Although there are myriad
ways to grieve, there are a few
common stages. In the HMiOs, Dr.

Klizabeth Rubier-Ross conducted
.1 series of groundbreaking studies
on terminally ill patients and their
families. What resulted was her
DAB DA model of grief , summed
up in her 19(H) book, "On Death
and Dying."
According to Rubier-Ross, the
five stages of grieving are denial,
anger, bargaining, depression
and acceptance. More recently,
critics like Dr. Michele (haban
have taken objection to Riibler-
Ross's model because of its rigidi
ty; how can everyone go through
the same intricate stages? Despite
continuing debate about the
exact stages of grief, most re
searchers agree on at least three
general phases: denial, anger and
acceptance.
Initially, many people experi
ence denial of the loss. Particular
ly in the case of sudden loss, denial
nukes sense because H provides

an easy way to escape the sudden
rush of emotions. This phase is
characterized by the literal denial
of .the loss and complete inatten
tion to any emotions the griever
may feel.
The next phase is anger. When
the griever starts to come to terms
with the loss, he or she may try to
find a cause tor it. Sometimes the
cause identified will be the griever
himself or even the deceased per
son. In any case, the angry griever
engages in a futile battle to change
the past by examining the chain of
causation and trying to change it.
The anger stage is where the griev
er begins to let himself experience
emotions around the loss while not
fully ready to accept it.
Finally, the griever will achieve
acceptance of the loss, hi this stage,
the griever both fully understands
that the loss has occurred and ac
cepts that nothing is going to
change that fact.
Another common theme of
most grieving is that it takes a long
time. A grieving period of five or
six years is not unusual after the
loss of a parent or sibling. Regard
less of the magnitude of the loss,
there is no set length of time for
the grieving process; it may be as
quick or as long .is tlit- griever feels
necessary.
So how does tins .ill applv to
you? Here are a few* tips about
grieving a loss at Stanford. First,
remember that everyone lias his or
her own way of grieving, so don't
feel guilty or ashamed if you're not
crying, not feeling depressed or
keep returning to work.
Counseling and Psychological
Services director Alejandro Mar
tine/ said, "[Students should] not
become judgmental of their feel

ings (e.g. not feeling sad enough,
feeling relief rather than grief , feel
ing nothing) but instead accept
them and work toward under
standing them."
Needless to say, Stanford stu
dents feel tremendous pressure to
perform academically under
stress, and grieving is no excep
tion. It is perfectly acceptable to
continue with work and grieve at
your own pace. Returning to your
normal life is part of the process.
That brings me to another
point: lake your time. Ifyou en
countered a loss during the
quarter and didn't want to fail
classes, one strategy would be to
channel your feelings toward
schoolwork and set aside some
time to grieve later, uninterrupt
ed from daily pressures. Fven if
you decide to face your feelings
immediately, allow yourself
plenty of time. Let the grieving
process run its natural course for
as long as it takes.
Finally, don't forget to take
care of yourself . ()f ten we will get
so involved in our emotions of
grief fora loss that we'll lose
touch with tilings like hunger or
hygiene. It doesn't make you a
bad or vain person to brush your
teeth or comb your hair while
grieving.
And how does one best support
a bereaved friend? The most im
portant thing is to bear in mind
that everyone grieves differently.
Some people will cry for days, oth
ers won't shed a tear. Still others
will watch baseball for 72 hours
straight. There is no wrong way
to grieve a loss. Don't be judgmen
tal of a friend il he isn't grieving in
what you think is the "traditional"
way. Try to support whatever

manner of grieving your friends
may choose.
Another crucial point to re
member is the timeline of grieving.
l he first stage is typically denial, in
which few emotions are exposed.
The bulk <>1 the difficult grieving
comes in the latter stages of the
process with anger and moving
into acceptance. In our culture,
most of the support for bereaved
persons comes at the very begin
ning of the process, surrounding
the funeral. Unfortunately, this
falls into the denial stage when the
least support is actually needed.
Friends will really need you six to
12 months down the road as thev
move into the anger and accep
tance stages ol mourning.
During those latter stages,
don't be afraid to approach
friends about their grieving. If
tbev are still grieving a loss, they
will be thinking about tin- loss; it
is not as if you will somehow re
mind them of their loss by bring
ing it up. ()n the contrary, by dis
cussing the loss with them, you
show your concern, acceptance
and support.
Grievers can also find comfort
in the grieving process itself. In
his essay, "The Solace of Pat
terns," researcher and Stanford
Biological Sciences and Neurolo
gy Prof. Robert Sapolsky writes,
"In <in entropic world, we can
take a common comfort from our
common patterns, and there is
often consolation in attributing
such matters to forces larger than
ourselves."

relationship 01 the destruction of
an heirloom.
('.rief is different for everyone.
It seems obvious, then, that "any
thing goes" when it comes to
mourning. I nfortunately, being
accepting of individual differ
ences in grieving is easier said
than done. It can be ver\ hard to
allow yourself to express whatever
feelings vou may encounter when
grieving. Keep that in mind as
vou experience grief yourself or
have friends who are grieving. A
supportive person will be accept
ing of anv wa\ the griever chooses
to mourn.
Although there are myriad
ways to grieve, there are a few
common stages. In the HMiOs, Dr.

Klizabeth Rubier-Ross conducted
.1 series of groundbreaking studies
on terminally ill patients and their
families. What resulted was her
DAB DA model of grief , summed
up in her 19(H) book, "On Death
and Dying."
According to Rubier-Ross, the
five stages of grieving are denial,
anger, bargaining, depression
and acceptance. More recently,
critics like Dr. Michele (haban
have taken objection to Riibler-
Ross's model because of its rigidi
ty; how can everyone go through
the same intricate stages? Despite
continuing debate about the
exact stages of grief, most re
searchers agree on at least three
general phases: denial, anger and
acceptance.
Initially, many people experi
ence denial of the loss. Particular
ly in the case of sudden loss, denial
nukes sense because H provides

an easy way to escape the sudden
rush of emotions. This phase is
characterized by the literal denial
of .the loss and complete inatten
tion to any emotions the griever
may feel.
The next phase is anger. When
the griever starts to come to terms
with the loss, he or she may try to
find a cause tor it. Sometimes the
cause identified will be the griever
himself or even the deceased per
son. In any case, the angry griever
engages in a futile battle to change
the past by examining the chain of
causation and trying to change it.
The anger stage is where the griev
er begins to let himself experience
emotions around the loss while not
fully ready to accept it.
Finally, the griever will achieve
acceptance of the loss, hi this stage,
the griever both fully understands
that the loss has occurred and ac
cepts that nothing is going to
change that fact.
Another common theme of
most grieving is that it takes a long
time. A grieving period of five or
six years is not unusual after the
loss of a parent or sibling. Regard
less of the magnitude of the loss,
there is no set length of time for
the grieving process; it may be as
quick or as long .is tlit- griever feels
necessary.
So how does tins .ill applv to
you? Here are a few* tips about
grieving a loss at Stanford. First,
remember that everyone lias his or
her own way of grieving, so don't
feel guilty or ashamed if you're not
crying, not feeling depressed or
keep returning to work.
Counseling and Psychological
Services director Alejandro Mar
tine/ said, "[Students should] not
become judgmental of their feel

ings (e.g. not feeling sad enough,
feeling relief rather than grief , feel
ing nothing) but instead accept
them and work toward under
standing them."
Needless to say, Stanford stu
dents feel tremendous pressure to
perform academically under
stress, and grieving is no excep
tion. It is perfectly acceptable to
continue with work and grieve at
your own pace. Returning to your
normal life is part of the process.
That brings me to another
point: lake your time. Ifyou en
countered a loss during the
quarter and didn't want to fail
classes, one strategy would be to
channel your feelings toward
schoolwork and set aside some
time to grieve later, uninterrupt
ed from daily pressures. Fven if
you decide to face your feelings
immediately, allow yourself
plenty of time. Let the grieving
process run its natural course for
as long as it takes.
Finally, don't forget to take
care of yourself . ()f ten we will get
so involved in our emotions of
grief fora loss that we'll lose
touch with tilings like hunger or
hygiene. It doesn't make you a
bad or vain person to brush your
teeth or comb your hair while
grieving.
And how does one best support
a bereaved friend? The most im
portant thing is to bear in mind
that everyone grieves differently.
Some people will cry for days, oth
ers won't shed a tear. Still others
will watch baseball for 72 hours
straight. There is no wrong way
to grieve a loss. Don't be judgmen
tal of a friend il he isn't grieving in
what you think is the "traditional"
way. Try to support whatever

manner of grieving your friends
may choose.
Another crucial point to re
member is the timeline of grieving.
l he first stage is typically denial, in
which few emotions are exposed.
The bulk <>1 the difficult grieving
comes in the latter stages of the
process with anger and moving
into acceptance. In our culture,
most of the support for bereaved
persons comes at the very begin
ning of the process, surrounding
the funeral. Unfortunately, this
falls into the denial stage when the
least support is actually needed.
Friends will really need you six to
12 months down the road as thev
move into the anger and accep
tance stages ol mourning.
During those latter stages,
don't be afraid to approach
friends about their grieving. If
tbev are still grieving a loss, they
will be thinking about tin- loss; it
is not as if you will somehow re
mind them of their loss by bring
ing it up. ()n the contrary, by dis
cussing the loss with them, you
show your concern, acceptance
and support.
Grievers can also find comfort
in the grieving process itself. In
his essay, "The Solace of Pat
terns," researcher and Stanford
Biological Sciences and Neurolo
gy Prof. Robert Sapolsky writes,
"In <in entropic world, we can
take a common comfort from our
common patterns, and there is
often consolation in attributing
such matters to forces larger than
ourselves."
