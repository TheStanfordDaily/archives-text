### LUSAN CHUA 
Dear Stanford Student,
Our records indicate that you have been chec k
ing your Leland e-mail in a way that gives hackers
a chance to steal your password.
You may have received a similar e-mail from
the Secure Computing Campaign. Perhaps the
ominous tone of this message inspired a little bit
of anxiety. But, being a busy Stanford student,
you probably sent that message straight to the
recycle bin.
And, then, you may have received another
message, explaining that your refusal to install
PC-I.eland could create vulnerabilities for the en
tire Stanford computer network. This might
have inspired some guilt, and perhaps a sense of
responsibility. But the chances are that you ig-

nored this one, too. Aftei all,
the stereotypical hacker in-

filtrates the Pentagon or
steals billion-dollar trade
secrets — why would they

be interested in your
silly old SUNet ID?
According to Stan
ford's Computer Securi
ty Officer. Stephen
Hansen, a hacker with
an active imagination
could cause cjui'e a bit of
mischief with your l,e-

land password. To begin
with, this person would
have access to your e-mail
account, allowing her to

send any number of harass
ing messages to your friends,
classmates and professors

under your name. She would have access to any
personal information you might have in your e
mail account.
She could alter or destroy any files that you
might have stored 011 the network — for example,
a personal Web site. And, if she captured your per
sonal identification number as well, she could log
into your Axess account, opening up a virtual Pan
dora's box of sensitive, personably identifiable in
formation, including your phone number, perma
nent mailing address, place of birth — and, most
importantly, your Social Security Number.
A Social Security Number might not seem
like top-secret information, but these nine digits
can be a tool fora hacker to commit the tradi
tional crime of identity theft. In a typical identi
ty theft case, someone uses your Social Security
Number and other bits of personal information
to open a bank account or apply fora credit card
in your name. Then she goes on a shopping
spree, leaving you responsible for large
amounts of debt. And, even if the hacker is
caught, you can be plagued with a false history
of bad credit that could present barriers when

you apply for loans, buy a car, rent an apart
ment or even interview for jobs.
The Federal Trade Commission recently re
ported that nearly 30 percent of identity theft
cases occur to victims in our age group. In one re
cent case, one college student's former friend
opened five bank accounts under her name, wrote
150 bad checks, bought four pieces of property
and racked up traffic violations that went on her
driving record.
Unfortunately, the court system does not pro
vide very much relief fora victim of identity theft.
Current U.S. law provides stronger remedies for
identity theft as a criminal, rather than a civil, vi
olation. (Meaning that a hacker could be sent to
jail, but you might not get your money back). The
Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act
makes identity theft a federal crime with penal
ties that can include a 15-year prison sentence
and a fine.

A hacker might also be
charged under federal laws
that prohibit computer fraud.
On a state level, the Califor-

nia Penal Code imposes
penalties tor using per
sonal information for

"any unlawful purpose,
including to obtain cred
it, goods, services or
medical information in
the name of another
person." However, none
of these statutes provide
any type of remedy for
the victim.
Under federal law, vic-

Tims of credit and banking
fraud are generally only li
able for the first $50 of loss.

However, clearing your name and credit
record can be a lengthy and expensive process it
self, and these losses are not included in this waiv
er.
Bringing a hacker to court to seek restitution or
reimbursement for your expenses can prove to be
a daunting task. The victim typically would need
to present a police report, a chronological record
of events, credit reports, telephone records and a
record of the overall costs incurred. Also, the
chances of winning in court are not certain, since
traditional law does not recognize identity as a
personal or property interest that should be pro
tected from wrongful conduct.
In short, identity theft is not a legal problem
that a victim can quickly and effectively resolve.
Although checking e-mail insecurely proba
bly won't bring the downfall of the entire net
work. World War 111 or a lifetime of bad credit
history, it might be a good idea to use PC-Le
land, just in case.

ties that can include a 15-year prison sentence
and a fine.

A hacker might also be
charged under federal laws
that prohibit computer fraud.
On a state level, the Califor-

nia Penal Code imposes
penalties tor using per
sonal information for

"any unlawful purpose,
including to obtain cred
it, goods, services or
medical information in
the name of another
person." However, none
of these statutes provide
any type of remedy for
the victim.
Under federal law, vic-

Tims of credit and banking
fraud are generally only li
able for the first $50 of loss.

However, clearing your name and credit
record can be a lengthy and expensive process it
self, and these losses are not included in this waiv
er.
Bringing a hacker to court to seek restitution or
reimbursement for your expenses can prove to be
a daunting task. The victim typically would need
to present a police report, a chronological record
of events, credit reports, telephone records and a
record of the overall costs incurred. Also, the
chances of winning in court are not certain, since
traditional law does not recognize identity as a
personal or property interest that should be pro
tected from wrongful conduct.
In short, identity theft is not a legal problem
that a victim can quickly and effectively resolve.
Although checking e-mail insecurely proba
bly won't bring the downfall of the entire net
work. World War 111 or a lifetime of bad credit
history, it might be a good idea to use PC-Le
land, just in case.
