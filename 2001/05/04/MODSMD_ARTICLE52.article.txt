Q: I had the most awful night
mare last night! I dreamt I was
taking a test that had questions I
couldn't answer (I'm pre-med, so
this is rare). Then 1 bolted from
the classroom into the crowded
hallway and realized tli.it 1 was
naked! Why do 1 have these
nightmares? I)o they have any
thing to do with the greasy In-N-
Out cheeseburgers 1 occasionally
eat before bed? Mv mom warned
me about eating right before 1 go
to sleep ...
A: Whoa, there; take a deep
breath. First off, let Answer
Girl explain what sleep means
physiologically.
Sleep is made up of two very
different behavioral states: rapid
eye movement, or RKM, sleep
and non-REM sleep. You start by
entering Stage One, a light sleep.
Your muscles relax, and your
brain waves switch irregularly and
rapidly. (For those who prefer
technical descriptions, these are
theta waves).
In Stage Two, brain waves be
come larger, with bursts of electri
cal activity (sleep spindles and k
complexes). Then you move into
deep sleep, Stages Three and
Four, in which the brain produces
large, slow waves (delta or slow
wave sleep). When you're in these
last two stages of non-REM sleep,
it's very difficult to wake you up.
After about an hour, you shift
into REM sleep, a surprisingly ac
tive stage distinguished bv rapid
eye movement — hence the
name. In fact, the individual nerve
cells are so active that your brain
waves are comparable to that of
your waking state. This signals
your arrival at the world of dreams
— literally. The high level of neu
ronal activity can be explained by
the fact that the brain is not only
taking in stimuli, but also generat
ing the very stimuli it perceives.
You spend about 25 percent of
your sleep time in this REM state.

and the rest of the 75 percent of
your night is spent in non-RKM
sleep. REM periods tend to occur
more frequently and last longer as
the night progresses.
Fortunately for your room
mate, you're effectively paralyzed
during REM so that you're not act
ing out your dreams. Of course,
this is under normal circum
stances. For all you sleepwalkers,
that's another topic for Answer
C»irl to address in the future.
According to Dr. William De
ment. professor of psychiatry, the
dreaming you experience during
REM sleep is your brain's creation
of its own personal world and liv
ing in it. The dream world is very
real while you're there. As a matter
of fact, the only difference in con
sciousness between the wake state
and REM sleep is that the dream
state isn't constrained by sensory
input from the physical world.
In other words, the images that
you see in the awakened state are
those created in response to stim
uli. The images that you see iti
your dreams are the same prod
ucts of neural activity, but the
brain creates the stimuli.
The link between REM sleep
and dreaming is, as Dement
analogized, like eating. When you
eat, you taste your food, but tast
ing doesn't have a physical benefit.
Thus, dreaming does not have
a determinable physical benefit.
But it is important to realize that
dreaming and REM are the con
scious and physical sides of the
same coin.
In dreaming, you are usually a
passive player. That means you
don't make decisions, and you
don't know what is going to hap
pen next. In fact, it's very much
like being at the movies — only
you're in the movie. Also, dreams
are typically not reflective.
That explains why you accept
the strangest things in your
dreams. Dement offered an ex
ample in which your roommate
suddenly tin us into a grape. In
active, conscious reality, you cer
tainlv would notice and become

alarmed. In your dreams, how
ever, you would accept this
strange occurrence.
Dement suggested a possible
explanation: "So much energy
and effort is required of the brain
to create a whole world with no
sensory input that very little brain
is left to reflect [judgment]." This
is analogous to playing a demand
ing game that commands your
full attention: You have very little
capacity for other considerations.
Most importantly, however, is
Dement s assertion tli.it nobody
knows why people dream what
they dream, and nobody really
knows what dreams mean. Many
sleep "experts" have theories that
they base on commonly observed
associations, but they are ex
tremely difficult to pare down
and prove scientifically. C Common
themes — such as flying, taking
tests, being naked in public, teeth
falling out and running away —
have very individual meanings.
For example, according to Sig
mund Freud, flying has sexual in
dications. (But, then again, so did
a great many other things for
Freud). But other dream analysts
connect flying to power. So De
ment suggests that you free-asso
ciate with your dreams: Go
through and relate the compo
nents of the dreams to the rest of
the dream. Then deduce from the
context. Unfortunately, no one
can tell you exactly what your
dream means for you. Even An
swer Girl can't help.
As for the connection between
your burger and the nightmare,
Dement states there are very few
factors that can cause you to have
more REM sleep — and, there
fore, dreaming.
There is one phenomenon that
can cause you to have more REM
sleep: sleep deprivation. Sleep de
privation causes REM sleep to
double up. and this intensity is
linked to the intense nature of
nightmares. The conclusion,
then, is that you shouldn't deprive
yourself of too much sleep if you
want to decrease your chances of
having nightmares.
So, what are you waiting for?
Go take a nap!
