are contracts that pay hospitals and doctors flat

monthly tics regardless of the < <»st of the patient
( are pn >vidcd. The over 8,000 Stanford students
enrolled in Cardinal ( arc will be unaffected by
this decision.
"What we are telling the insurance carriers is
that we do not wish to offer the 11M( Vscapitated
plans," said Susan Deiterle, an offi( ial of the
Medical ( .enter's news and public affairs office.
"We are looking to renegotiate other types of

plans with the health tare companies that will
offer higher reimbursement rates."
Although (Cardinal (lat eis the type of < apitat
ed plan that tin- Medical ('.enter will exit come
|antiary, Cardinal Care will he exempt from
these changes until Sept. 2002.
"It is too hard to say what ('.ardinal (.are will
look like lot ilie* 2002-2003 academic vear," said Dr. Ira
Iricilman, diicctoi of Cowcll Student Health CCenter.
"We are win king to maintain ('.ardinal C lare's low-coast,
its comprehensive service and its involvement with the
Medii al (ienter ... so, .is von can imagine, we have .1 lot
of work to do."
(.ardinal (la re will wot k with health insurance bene
fits consultants, who design health insurance plans, to
come up with .1 new plan ovet the next several months.
I Ik agi cement reai lied in the negotiations bet worn the
Medical ('.enter and I he six I INK >s "w ill haveaneHect on
the options available to us in September 2002," Fried
man said.
I he Medical ( enter initialh decided to notify the
six managed t are insurers that it was exiting its con

"We are making necessan < lianges to assure our fis

president of the Medical (lenter, according to an at tii le
in the Stanford Report. "We remain committed to pro

I lie reimbursement situation is a national problem,
aflccting both academic medic .il centers and comnnini
i\ hospitals. All of the countrv s 12a academit teaching
hospitals are aflecteil. and .is inanv as one-quarter of
them will merge 01 declare bankruptcy in the next five
\ ears. Sixtv percent ol .ill ('.alifot ilia's hospitals are losing
nionev, and, when cost of is accountcd tor, Bay
Area hospitals recei\eil aboui half as much reimburse

1 he 1997 Balanced Budget Act, in conjunction with
c utstoothci programs, reduced the amount that the fed
eral govei liuient gave to teac liing hospitals In $1 15 bil
lion. Asa 1 esult, the revenue to the Stanford I lospital and
( Imic s has chopped $80 million ovet the past four vears.
"Fvcn year hospitals have negotiations on the
amount ol compensation that tliev are receiving from
HMOs," Dcitcrle said. "We want them to understand
that these are the t lit Fit uliits we face and we want to see
what son ol agreement we can come to that will best
meet the needs of 0111 patients and lac ultv."
