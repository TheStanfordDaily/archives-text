Uff-color jokes? Centerfolds cm
the wall? Sexual innuen
does? Fun, right? Not necessarily.
Sexual harassment? Possibly. It's a
confusing and controversial topic.
Think of sexual harassment as a
form of communication that can
be perceived in different ways:
one bv the communicator, another
by the recipient, and yet another
by an "objective" third party.
What Is It?
Sexual harassment takes several
forms:
■ Unwelcome or coercive sexual
advances in exchange for favor
able treatment, or under the
threat of unfavorable treatment
(e.g., grades; jobs; promotions)
■ Sexually-related behaviors that
create a hostile academic,
living, or work environment
and interfere with someone's
academic or work performance
(e.g., unwanted sexual com
ments, jokes, e-mails and pub
licly posted sexual graphics)
■ Persistent and unwanted com
munications of a sexual nature
(e.g., in person, by phone or e
mail, or insistent pursuit after a
break-up)
■ It can involve repeated
actions, or one incident if
sufficiently severe; can occur
between peers, in hierar
chical relationships, or
between persons of the same
or opposite gender; can be
subtle or blatant
■ If sexual touching is involved
it can also be sexual assault
Why It's Important
Sexual harassment can:
■ Create fearandin tim id at ion
fi£ ="
Pi Ir i m
The term "sexual harassment"
wasn't commonly used when
this picture ivas taken at
Stanford around T903.
■ Be an abuse of power or an
attempt to control someone else
■ Lead to tension and conflict
in a community
■ Deprive others of the
opportunities they came to
Stanford to enjoy - to study,
work, and live in a sup
portive environment
Sexual harassment violates
university policy and can bring
about legal and university
disciplinary sanctions.
How To Stop It
■ Don't put up with it (there's
no reason to blame yourself -
it's not your fault)
■ Speak up (silence enables
harassment to continue toward
you or someone else; keep
notes and records, including e
mails)
■ Tell the person to stop,
verbally or in writing (be firm
and clear - they'll often back
off), or give them this flyer
■ If you are uncomfortable
dealing with it by yourself, ask
a trusted person in authority
to assist you (e.g., residential
staff, staff or faculty)
The University has resources
available to discuss your options.
They include confidential coun
seling with a counselor at CAPS,
campus clergy, or the University
Ombudsperson. Residence Deans
and other Sexual Harassment
Advisors can also help (see
Resources below)
Important Tips
■ Avoid misunderstandings:
when communicating about
sexual matters your values
and style may be different I
from others' (what's accept
able to one may not be to I
another), so when in doubt, I
check it out
■ When someone says "stop" or
expresses uneasiness, respect I
their limits (ask yourself if you I
would want your sister or
brother to be addressed this
way)
■ When a relationship is break
ing up, formerly endearing
behaviors can become offen- I
sive, so if your "ex" expresses I
discomfort, back off, and talk I
your feelings through with a I
neutral party
■ There are extra risks it you
become involved sexually
with someone who is in an
inherently unequal position
(e.g., teacher/student; dorm
resident/staff) - consent may
be misunderstood, and later,
breaking up can have major
consequences
