could just walk in and pick out a great used car Oh, sure, there are used cars

by Enterprise, 12-month, 12,000 mile service agreement, 7-dav buy-back
policy and no haggling—1 couldn't miss this!"
Reporters peppered Dog-Boy with questions about where he came
from, where he's been hiding and why dogs' le gs kick up and down when

Dear Q&Q: I am a Classics major and was given a necklace
that features a Mercury dime. It's such a lovely image. Why
hasn 7 the U.S. Mint stamped other coins with Roman and
Greek gods and goddesses?
Signed, Diana
Dear Diana,
You II need to start hunting for Roman and Greek heroes on
some other country 's coins. Not one of the US coins shows
such a personage. The so-called "Mercury" figure is actually
artist Adolph Weinman 's design of Liberty. The wings on her
cap symbolize freedom of thought. I work at SFCU, so I know.
Luis Orbegoso, HR/Purchasing Representative, SFCU
Dear Q&Q: There was quite a buzz when the most recent
version of the dollar coin was introduced. However, I never see
them in common circulation. Was the Sacagewea dollar just a
collector 's item or did the Treasury really hope to have us use
them? Frankly, I prefer paper.
Signed, Paper Boy
Dear Boy: Actually, you're not alone. The US Mint continues to
promote use of dollar coins. The average paper bill lasts only
for about 18 months in circulation before it is worn out. On the
contrary, a coin lasts for up to 15 years in circulation. I work at
SFCU, so I know.
