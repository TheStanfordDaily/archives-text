1975
On May 7, 1975, The Daily printed an
article about high enrollment in elementary
economics.
"Economics l'rof. |olin Cinrley doesn't
need to pack his lectures with jokes. Students
are tl<k king to his course in Elementary Eco
nomics ihis quarter tor other reasons.
" 'Economics has been on the front page
ot newspapers tor the past two years, and
the amount ot attention it gets is not a dis
tortion.' (int ley says. 'Before unemploy
ment and inflation there was the devalua
tion of the doll.n and the influx of petrodol
lars. Students see these things and realize
that they don't know .is much as they'd like
to about them.'
"A retold enrollment of (>64 students iti
(Inrley's Kc<>nomics 1 this quarter is just one
aspet i of .i broad-based economics boom.
I otal undci graduate enrollment in eco
nomics ( ourses has iiu teased H5.7 percent
since 1971-72. 1 lie number of economics
majors li.is doubled.
"(airrentl\. 49K students are registered
.is m.ijoi sin the department. As the number
ot e( onomi( s majors increases, so does the
dilli< 11It \of standing out from the crowd."
Bottom line: Wonder who will be the next
John Taylor or John Gurley in the Economics
Department?
