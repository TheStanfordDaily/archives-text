how clean you keep your kitchen or
whether or not you spray insecticides,
according to a new Stanford study.
"Pesticides aren't keeping them out,
the weather is," said Deborah Gor
don, a Stanford biological sciences
professor and author of the study.
"These ants come into everyone's
homes at the same time."
