# JUST A BIT OUTSIDE
## Shedding my inhibitions 
### 
Shoved somewhere in mv dresser .it
home, I have .1 I-shirt with .1 car
toon on the front. It's a drawing ola
tall, naked man holding a surthoard
in .1 (onvenienth concealing position.
Above him are two words, large and 111
bright green letteis.
"Nude I hide."
I he shirt was a gag gift that somehow
ended up in in\ hands, veai s ago, altei one
too many jokes about Flysiuin Fields — the
neighboring nudist colonv, less than a 30-
minute drive from mv middle school. I lid-

I never had any prob

frequented Flvsiuni
Fields, but, .is .111 eighth

picturing naked people running around,
pla\ ing volleyball in the woods.
As I grew older, 1 started to get .1 better
idea ol what Fhsium Fields represented.
Naked people running around and play
ing volleyball wasn't about lust 01 sex. It was
about freedom. It was, and is. about cm
br.K ing "the |o\ of living and experient ing
nature in the most natural wav p(>ssible," .is
the American Association for Nude Recre
ation says. " Fo relax and be nude is to let
yourself be totally free."
I'lie nude recreation movement is out
there, and it is growing fast. Fven as a voting
man in (ollege, 111 v tendency is to respond to
this with a giggle, but I think we constantly
need to open our minds to new ideas. And
although the idea of nude recreation isn't
exactly new, it is gaining in popularity.
In the past two years, ,'JO new American
Association for Nude Recreation clubs
opened in the United States. With 241
clubs, resorts and campgrounds already,
the association recognized that it had a
booming market on its hands and decided
to do a little more research.
In a recent poll ol Americans, it found
1 hat just about one in five Americans had
tried skinny dipping in the company of
In>ili males and females. It found that IH
percent of Americans would consider visit
ing clothing-optional beaches or resorts.
And it found that the more educated a per
son is, the more likely he or she is to be open
to skinny dipping.
So, it didn't surprise me last week to see
a flier posted on my dormitory hall for the
Stanford University Naturist C Hub. "Do you

likr being naked? Kxpcrience freedom!" it
read. "Join the S.l .V (Hub!"

Shoved somewhere in mv dresser .it
home, I have .1 I-shirt with .1 car
toon on the front. It's a drawing ola
tall, naked man holding a surthoard
in .1 (onvenienth concealing position.
Above him are two words, large and 111
bright green letteis.
"Nude I hide."
I he shirt was a gag gift that somehow
ended up in in\ hands, veai s ago, altei one
too many jokes about Flysiuin Fields — the
neighboring nudist colonv, less than a 30-
minute drive from mv middle school. I lid-

(It'll In trees .ind rolling
hills, there was .1 mysteri
ous .ind mythical element
to Flvsiuni Fields. None
(>1 us had ever visited it, so
none of us ever knew ex
arth what went on there.
I never had any prob
lem with the nudists who
frequented Flvsiuni
Fields, but, .is .111 eighth

gradei. there were leu tilings fiinnici than
picturing naked people running around,
pla\ ing volleyball in the woods.
As I grew older, 1 started to get .1 better
idea ol what Fhsium Fields represented.
Naked people running around and play
ing volleyball wasn't about lust 01 sex. It was
about freedom. It was, and is. about cm
br.K ing "the |o\ of living and experient ing
nature in the most natural wav p(>ssible," .is
the American Association for Nude Recre
ation says. " Fo relax and be nude is to let
yourself be totally free."
I'lie nude recreation movement is out
there, and it is growing fast. Fven as a voting
man in (ollege, 111 v tendency is to respond to
this with a giggle, but I think we constantly
need to open our minds to new ideas. And
although the idea of nude recreation isn't
exactly new, it is gaining in popularity.
In the past two years, ,'JO new American
Association for Nude Recreation clubs
opened in the United States. With 241
clubs, resorts and campgrounds already,
the association recognized that it had a
booming market on its hands and decided
to do a little more research.
In a recent poll ol Americans, it found
1 hat just about one in five Americans had
tried skinny dipping in the company of
In>ili males and females. It found that IH
percent of Americans would consider visit
ing clothing-optional beaches or resorts.
And it found that the more educated a per
son is, the more likely he or she is to be open
to skinny dipping.
