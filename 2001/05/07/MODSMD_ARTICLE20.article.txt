Allegations that Stanford is violating the

are false.

In approving the Coinmunitv I'lan in De

Opponents also wrongly claim that

Carnegie can be relocated to the tore

that Stanford t an not realist it all\ do so. All
2 million square feet of new academic
space and all 2,000 new student housing
units must fit into 991 acres, or only 12
percent of Stanford's H. I NO acres. .\n<l, of

Hewlett Foundation deserves thanks
I he I lewlett Foundation's $400 million
gift to Stanford is not onlv breathtaking and

unpreccdented in scale, ii is also extraordi
narily t liiu-K .ind more urgently needed
than most people reali/e. I lie School of
Humanities and Seienees is in clifficult li
nanrial sii.iiis. Dozens of faculty appoint
ments are frozen, waiting to be filled. The
hiring freeze cannot be allowed to persist,
or it will do enormous damage to the qual
ity, variety and depth of instruction
throughout the school.
We are likeh to look back on ibis excep
tional nift as the turning point that restored
the School of Humanities and Sciences to
fiscal and programmatic vitality. Every
Stanford student, now and for decades to
come, will benefit.
It may sound cornv or old-fashioned,
but I hope Stanford students will write to
the I lewlett Foundation to thank it fortius
gift and to reflect fora moment on what it
in.i\ mean for them. I hat can be done by
mail to: Ihe Hewlett Foundation, 525
Middlcfield Rd., Suite 200, Menlo Park,
CIA 94025.
