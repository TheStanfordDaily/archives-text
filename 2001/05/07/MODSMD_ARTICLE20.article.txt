Hewlett Foundation deserves thanks
The Hewlett Foundation's $400 million
gift to Stanford is not onlv breathtaking and

unpreccdented in scale, ii is also extraordi
narily t liiu-K .ind more urgently needed
than most people reali/e. I lie School of
Humanities and Seienees is in clifficult li
nanrial sii.iiis. Dozens of faculty appoint
ments are frozen, waiting to be filled. The
hiring freeze cannot be allowed to persist,
or it will do enormous damage to the qual
ity, variety and depth of instruction
throughout the school.
We are likeh to look back on ibis excep
tional nift as the turning point that restored
the School of Humanities and Sciences to
fiscal and programmatic vitality. Every
Stanford student, now and for decades to
come, will benefit.
It may sound cornv or old-fashioned,
but I hope Stanford students will write to
the I lewlett Foundation to thank it fortius
gift and to reflect fora moment on what it
in.i\ mean for them. I hat can be done by

fiscal and programmatic vitality. Every
Stanford student, now and for decades to
come, will benefit.
It may sound cornv or old-fashioned,
but I hope Stanford students will write to
the I lewlett Foundation to thank it fortius
gift and to reflect fora moment on what it
in.i\ mean for them. I hat can be done by
mail to: Ihe Hewlett Foundation, 525
Middlcfield Rd., Suite 200, Menlo Park,

Hewlett gift highlights conflict of interest
I agree with your May 1 editorial
("Hewlett gift gives Stanford chance to
renew faith") that the allocation of the
Hewlett Foundation's gift of $■}()() mil
lion t(» the School ol llnmanities and
Sciences deserves to be applauded.
However, 1 leel there is a question of
conllu t of interest raised b\ the founda
tion s gcnei osii\.
Vs a graduating' senioi majoring in I n
glish, I am pleased to heai that future hu
manities students w ill benefit from this infu
sion of funds. Hut I am also awaiting with
bitter disappointment the ( oninieiu eineni
addrc •ss ol (i.n l\ Fiorina, chief'execulive of-
Ik ei of the I lew kit-I'.u kard corporation. As
main students before me have said, the
problem lies not with a la< k of respect for
Fiorina, but the missed opportunih to beat
a speaker with great ei intellectual oi bu
manitarian c|iialifi( ations.
FuitheniK>re. n is well understood that
the decision to invite Fiorina rested entire
ly with I'niversity President |ohn 1 len
nessy — the senior (lass presidents pub
licly declaimed responsibility and I len
ncssN has taken upon himself the task ol

(It-tending Ikm selection. It is disturbing

As someone who has invested a lifetime in
education. I believe thai more ought to
be done to lurthci the (jiicsi lot <|iialit\

However, to pursue these goals, both
short-and l< >ng-tenn, planning is necessary.

\ou, .is an educator, to please reconsider
and support this plan fin the future from
which we can all benefit.

Carnegie plan heralds Stanford's
future development plans
I he evil genius puffed on his at rid cigar
and smiled knowingly. Ileside him, the
Stanford development man forlornh con
tempi.ited the depii lion of Ins dream — a
top-set ret model, glinting under the fluo
rescent plastic buildings, intcr
speised with |>ai king lots, covered the pa
pier mache hillsides. I he two men got

down to business.
"We've giving awav our right to devel
op the hillsides in exchange loi building
more on the flatlands," said the Stanford
development man. "How can we get the
count\ supervisors to let us build on the
hillsides now?"
"Simple. Someone won't give you .1
penn\? You get a cute baby to get it tor
von." said the evil genius. "Kind somehcxh
with a good-sounding name, like the
C.arncgie l-oundaiion, and let them devel
op it for you!"
"W'liv would thev do that?"
"Kasv. (live them the land. That should
etitic e them!"
"We give them land?"
"Sure. With all the inoncv that'll save
them. the\ can afford a good fight with
the c ountv stipenisors. And. best of all, it
will be them, and not Stanford, fighting
l< >1 development.
()nce the\ win and start digging up the
bills, it'll be- a simple matter for Stanford to
get Us projects through."
"Wow! I hat's the kind of idea we pay
you for! Doyourealh think the supervisors
will fall for it?"
"You know what 1 think about tlu- su

pcrvisors: Make n I<m >k i nddlv enough, and
they'll ki sn it. Kesides, it's not costing \oii a
(ftit. And if (lai negie wins, tlif sk\lines the
limit lor Stanford!"
