Arizona (54-4, 16-2). Two of these games

nation battled each other fora marathon
game of 15 innings that lasted four and a
half hours.
The Cardinal went through four pitch
ers on the day, with sophomore Maureen
LeCocq starting the game, followed by
sophomores Fori Nvberg, Dana Sorensen
and Jamie Forman-Lau. The Wildcats start
ed senior Becky Lenike, but as the ('.ardinal

began to rock the Arizona pitcher— post
ing three runs .iiul tying the game — unde
feated Jennie Finch, who was victorious
against the ('ardinal on Saturday, took oyer
the rubber.
I he game seemed like it was meant foi
the ('.ardinal, as it was shutting down the
nationally renowned Wildcat offense and
scored the first run of the game in the bot
tom of the second inning off of ,i line drive
single by Shelburne.
But, then, in the top of the third, Arizona
answered back, beginning when Lislia Ri~
belli.i led off with a walk and was moved to
second on a sacrifice bunt. I hen Nicole (ii
ardano and I oni Mast arenas produced
consecutive singles to firing about the first
('.ardinal pitching t hange.
With Nvberg in the circle and runners
on first and second, Finch roped a ball up
the middle, making the store 3-1.
Stanford did not give up, but, instead.
