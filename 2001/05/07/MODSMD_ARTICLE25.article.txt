nationally renowned Wildcat offense and
scored the first run of the game in the bot
tom of the second inning off of ,i line drive
single by Shelburne.
But, then, in the top of the third, Arizona
answered back, beginning when Lislia Ri~

ardano and I oni Mast arenas produced
consecutive singles to firing about the first
