# Students consider their Draw options
## Stanford undergrads voice varied opinions about Housing Draw 
### MARY DANIELS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ask undergraduates what they like best alxuit
the University, and many will answer: life in the
residences. Ask what they dread more than
spring quarter finals, and many will answer with
two words: the Draw.
Hie deadline for the first part of the process,

fbrminga Draw group of lietween one and eight
people, was lasi night. Draw numbers will be
available on Axess after May 10, and house rank
ings are due by Mav 13.
Last year, Bob was the most competitive
house for women drawing alone, with a cutoff
of 171. Fora group of eight, OHO Lomita was
the most competitive house, not accommodat
ing applic ants with numbers greater than 10.
Sophomore Susan Quan, who drew pre
ferred into Hob this year, said, "I think the
two major attractions of Bob are the large
number of two-room doubles and its ama/ing
chef, Rob."
For men, Limbda Nu was the most compet

itive, with a cutoff for single applicants at 94 and
a cutoff for eight-person groups at 23. Xanadu
also drew extremely low last year, not accom
modating numbers over 165.
Because the application numbers are assigned
randomly, there is little room for contention after
the numbers are posted. Students expressed dif
fering opinions alxnit the process.
"I was part of an eight-person Draw group
last year and was able toget into one of my top
choice residences," said sophomore Randy
Ciullett, who drew preferred into 553 Mayficld
last year. "1 think that the process, being that
