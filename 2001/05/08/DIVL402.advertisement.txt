It's easy to make
a child smile. A few words
of encouragement, maybe a special
reward fora special performance.
Parents do it all the time,
and so do teachers.
Good teachers are the difference
between a child who succeeds
and one who stumbles.
They are the ones who make
math fun and science seem like
an adventure into another world.
Teaching is the profession
that allows you to see the most
gratifying, immediate and
instantaneous reward of a job
well done - a child's smile.
