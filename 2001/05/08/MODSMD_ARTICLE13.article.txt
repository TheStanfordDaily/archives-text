1975
On Nl.iv <S, 1975, The Daily printed an article
about fraternity pranks.
" I he tear-gas bomb thrown into the Sigma Nu
house last Wednesday night turned out to be a fra
ternity prank perpetrated by seven Theta Chi
brothers, according to Dean of Men William Craig.
"Stanford Police (ihief (iordon Davis announc ed
that the names of the offenders have been sent to
Craig for disciplinary action. Earlier the FBI had
been working on the case since tear-gas bombings
I.ill under their jurisdiction.
"Davis said that the bombing was meant to ap
pear to be a pledge sneak and that the seven Theta
Chi's had intended to steal silverware, not a radio,
\\ 11 it h they pilfered instead in the confusion."
Bottom line: The racist graffiti incident would probably also
be solved more quickly if we could get tfie FBI involved in Hie
investigation.
