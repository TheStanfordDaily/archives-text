While Kit heinendv also said he will not

side and outside the six departments in
tjuesiion, will be asked to sit on this coin
mission. It is, however, etiuallv important

that students be asked for their input —at
every step ol the process — as well. Students
deserve a fair chance to speak on this issue, es
pecially since they have fought so public 1\ to
prevent the merger from l.iking plat e.

the merger was slated to take plat e Sept. 1 or

xersitx and members ol the commission. But
students must also take the lime to follt >w up on

the quarter, but students who have fought so
hard cannot aflortl to sit back and expect a
miracle. I hex must keep an eye on the I ni
vcrsitx and remain vocal, especially when the

.iikl make sure thai it is effective. The formation
cannot Ik- a halfhearted attempt to appease
protesting students. Students should see results so
tliev do not believe the slowing down is an effort
to stall for time until fall quarter —when some
will have foigotten about the ineiger debate. Fur
thermore, the community must have concrete ex
amples ol how the commission will operate dur
ing the summer and fall, and we encourage
Kit heinendy i<> stronglv consider how the com
mittee will evaluate the current propositi. Will
tliev look to models from other institutions? Will
ilie\ re-evaluate some of the other ideas?
We are delighted lhal the provost has an
nounced a slow-down of the department tneiger,
and, as he and his colleagues appoint and chaige
111 is«ommission with its important task, we ask that
heiiM lude a high level of student involvement and
stav true to his stated purposes so that this process
can be belter the second time around.
