while sitting next to me in set lion just to ask
inc tins in i il»1\ pressing question. M\ an
swci is invariably. "No, I am n<>i Ironi Aus

Well. I don't (|uite s.i\ it like that, but. not
being Australian, ibis (|uestion does get
(juile aiin< >\ ing altei a while.
Win do tbe\ .isk me ibis question? For
reasons unknown i<> me. llie Anient an eai

language f<>i llie liisi lime. As you (an see,
I've tbougbt about this quite a lot.

an Aussie.
l.arb in my Stanford (arecr, I decided
to throw .i little confusion into llie mix h\
leai ning some Anient an sl.uig. American
slang (omnig out <>112 the mouth of a South
Mricaii would be priceless. I thought.
What could be better? M\ education .is
"an Ainct u an" began when I was thrown
into student life .is a fresh man iu I rancos,
and I enlisted m\ peel health educator
Na'eeni as m\ slang guru. In om lii si les
son. we ta( kled an expression tli.it had me
baffled from da\ one.
"M\ bad I bis nub absurd expression
contused the hell out of me. \l\ bad ibis.
M\ bad th.it. I honcsth couldn't figure out
what it ineant. Was I bad.' Was the person
s,i\ iiig il bad? Were we both bad.-' VN as this
file opposite of "ni\ good ? (.otildn I peo
ple just s.i\ "(H>ps oi "I'm soi i \. I made a
mistake"? What evei happened to gtx w I
old-fashioned I tiglish? Na'eeni shed some
light on the meaning of this and many
othei nitk\ Anient auisnis. but, after a
while. I reali/cd tli.it the onb wax lolrub
learu would be through interactions with

the Fx als. Some of these encounters proved
lo be good, some ol tliein bad, bill most of
them were vcr\ bad and embarrassing.
Iwo parii( ill.ii in< idenis come to mind.
Ihe fii st oi (lu red onb a few weeks into
llie ve.ii. M\ neighboi Scott, who unlil
lhat point had been.i perfe( I gentleman,
confided in me ih.il he I bought llie gnl I
had a ( rush on was realb fat. Noi just f.il.
Kill realb Lit. I was shot ked and iminedi
aleb responded thai pel haps she did have
a lit lie meal around I lie edges, hut she cer
tainly could not be ( aleg(>i izcil as (>bese. It
w.is.ii ibis point thai in\ eyes were opened
to the subtleties of \incrit an slang. Fat w.is
spelled p-h-a-l. And ibis word that tradi
tionally meant ili.il someone ate too mu< b
now meant that someone was cool.
I lie set ond cut oi inter octm red while I
w.is doing Math 12 homework with a de
vout Christian girl. In the middle of a
tough problem set, I asked lici if she had a
rubbei I (ould boi row. She be( aine visibb
defensive and stared at me for at Ic.isi 10
se( onds. I hadn't realized thai lending oui
sialioneiA was such .i serious business m
\niei u.i. Fix lav. the girl and I laugh w hen
we look back on ibis incident, but. at llie
lime, it was not lunnv at all. You see, the
idea that a rubbei and a condom were the
same tiling bad ncvei occurred to inc.
W'liei e 1 (aine 112 rom, a i übbei was an ei as
er. A pie< eol slalionei \. Innocent enough,
I had thought. Now I know the truth.
In subsequent months and years, ex
pressions ranging from "da bomb" and
"wassup tlawg" to "mad bops" and
"schwcct" bccanie integral parts of my vo
cabulary. Fi ientls back home thought I had
gonet razv. Friends .it Stanford thought I
had gone even ( lazier, but I was amusing
ni\ self and othei sand fell in some sin.ill way
ili.it I was absorbing American "culture."
1 odav, I pull out niv American slang on
the odd occasion to impress girls oi to con
fuse people who think I am Australian, but
I have tried, foi llie most part, to retain
what is left of in\ F.nglish. M\ friends at
Stanford are still endlcsslv amused by the
wax I speak, even without the slang. In
partii ular, the\ like the wax I pronounce
the popular fish product lima. I say
"choona" instead of "toona." But that's an
entirely different siihjet t.
Asa xoungbox growing upon the streets
of |ohanticshurg, I could never have imag
ined that I would one day beat Stanford, or
that m\ ruhlmt would have put me in such
an awkward situation. Mv bad, I guess.
