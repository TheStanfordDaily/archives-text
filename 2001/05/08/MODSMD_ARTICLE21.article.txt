Increasing housing occupancy
is not the solution
I strongly disagree with the idea of 111-
(leasing student density in existing grad
uate housing. II we could trust the I ni
versitv to increase student density fora
short time while actively building more
housing, that idea might be feasible.
However, the University has shown
itself willing to turn "temporary" in
creases in housing density into the per
manent housing situation. Your pro
posed "temporary" solution will only
remove the pressure on the I nivcrsitv
to do something about the problem 111
the future.
I here are plenty of other options.
First, I do not believe that our I nivcrsi
tv is too poor to be able to subsidize off
campus housing, even in Palo Alto. Sec -
ond, even though we may not be able to
expand onto undeveloped land, why not
build more high-rise buildings? While
the beauty of low buildings affects quali
ty of life, I believe that personal space is
the more important factor.
Third, if the University truly believes
it has .111 obligation to provide good,
cheap housing to graduate students,
then it must admit that it cannot fulfill
that obligation with current policies and
rediu e the number of graduate students
admitted.

Furthermore, there is much devel
oped spat e on campus that is being used
foi relatively unimportant pin poses.
()ne example is the huge new Frant es (
An illaga Alumni ('.enter — I have
heard that the first floor is ( urrcntlv not
being used.
()u the othei hand, it would be more
laii to allow graduate students to
choose whcthei to live in high-density
on-campus housing oi to pa\ more and
live off campus (instead of ton ing them
into good living conditions but possibly
having high rates off ( ainpus).
However, I believe that il the Uni
vcrsity was actually willing to solve tins
problem at the expense of growth in
some other area, it could do so easily,
(iiven this. I think increasing student
density would onb lake the pressure off
the University to make the sacrifice that
should rightfully come from someone
other than students.
