I <> give is belter than lo receive.
But don i tell ill.u lo I evo |ohnson.
After xears in the passing mindset of foot
ball, Johnson finally knows what its like to be
on the receiving end. And he likes what he's
learning.
I he rcdshirt freshman caught three passes
lor two touchdowns in leading the Cardinal
team over the \\ bite, 21-0. in the team's annu
al inters(|iiad scrimmage. Held April 28 at
Stanford Stadium, the game xv.is .1Â» hance for
bead coach I \ rone Willingham to explore bis
options lor next season, and. with manv ke\
players sidelined In injurx, nianx of (lie
squad's young si.ns had the opportunity to
showcase their talents.

his explosiveness and athletit ism.
Willingham chose the latter, and |ohnson
lined up for the lii si time as a \\ide receiver.
I in still a t|uarterhat kin theii eyes, but
tliex need me on the field this vear," |ohnson
said. "I won't tlo us anx good standing on the
sideline with a clipboard."

yards, but ii was the final plax ol the game th.it

In the final seconds, Lewis launched a S6-
yard Hail Marx into the end /one. Johnson
skved over his defenders and ripped the ball
from the air, bearing more than a little resem
blance to his terrific rebounding ability as a
power forward.

spring practice and promised more excite

starters and 10 lettermen. Last year, in a tal
ented Pacific 10 Conference in which three
teams finished in the nation's top 10. the Car
din.il wound up fourth in the conference but
unable to make a bowl because of its 5-6 record.
"We need to regain the mantle of being an
explosive offensive team," Willingham said.
l lie hit k of that ingredient, 1 believe, affected
our overall team play last season. We simply
did not have the one or two plavers who could
be counted on to provide that threat. We need
to regain that type of player. We need that ex
plosivcuess to be a component of our offensive
football team."
But with an oflense returning last season's
two starting quarterbacks, three starting run
ning backs and entire starting otiensive line,
the ( ardin.il looks poised to improve.
()n defense, Stanford feels a huge loss of
leadership and talent with the graduation of
lineman Willie I loxvard and outside linebacker
Riall Johnson, both of whom were selected in
last month's NFL draft.
"Replacing Howard and |ohnson will be
verx difficult, Willingham saitl. "But we feel
good about the players we have on defense, es
