### DEBORAH SPLANSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Known to bet teammates as Rob-Dog, Robo and
Lucy, junior Robin Walker plays the role of starting
slioi tst <>|>. leaclofl hitter and mental leader fbi the No.
3 Stanford softball team.
Before the I.a I'alma native landed on the Farm,
she was already known across the country for her soft
ball prowess, Beginning at age two. Walker was taking
< ui> off the tee with her dad, Wa\ lie, while mom Rot ki
was shagging young Walker's line drives.
Ii did not lake long before Walker made softball a
serious part of her life, .is she began winning national
championships with the national powerhouse dub
team, "(iordon's Panthers," at age 14. Two national
championships and one (Hub All-Ainerican honor
later, Walker decided to pursue bet future in softball
as a member of the (Cardinal softball program.
I saw [Stanford] as the perfect world — .1 great
mix of academics and athletics," Walker said. "I only
looked at s( hools with great academic programs, and
Stanford was the best of both worlds."
And now that she is here. Walker said she looks at
hci fellow Stanford students as the best part of being
011 the Farm.
"I think one of Ihe coolest things here is that 11011-
athletes respect you," Walker said. " I hey know tll.lt
yon didn't jusi gel here due to athletic skill, but thai
you were ac c epted first .is a student."
She is majoring in history with a minor in Russian
and Eastern European studies and wantstoattend law
school.
"She is always thinking," junior Sarah Beeson
said. "She is always a step ahead of everyone else on
the field."
A play that demonstrates Walker's cpiic k mind and
collected manner occurred in a game this season
against C )rcgon. I lie Ducks hit .1 ground ball to Walk
er, who initially misplaved the ball. It bounced off of
her glove, but, while everyone else 111 the stadium
groaned that the play at fiisi base was lost. Walker
cjiiic klv recovered the ball and tagged second base —
a second before the runner at first could get there.
Though many of her teammates c redit Walker as
perhaps the smartest player they have ever encoun
tered. it is the combination of her phy sic aland mental
game that cause many to refer to her as an unparal-
lelcd s\u>i tstop.

Junior Robin Walker makes a play at shortstop against Oregon earlier
this season.
Known to bet teammates as Rob-Dog, Robo and
Lucy, junior Robin Walker plays the role of starting
slioi tst <>|>. leaclofl hitter and mental leader fbi the No.
3 Stanford softball team.
Before the I.a I'alma native landed on the Farm,
she was already known across the country for her soft
ball prowess, Beginning at age two. Walker was taking
< ui> off the tee with her dad, Wa\ lie, while mom Rot ki
was shagging young Walker's line drives.
Ii did not lake long before Walker made softball a
serious part of her life, .is she began winning national
championships with the national powerhouse dub
team, "(iordon's Panthers," at age 14. Two national
championships and one (Hub All-Ainerican honor
later, Walker decided to pursue bet future in softball
as a member of the (Cardinal softball program.
I saw [Stanford] as the perfect world — .1 great
mix of academics and athletics," Walker said. "I only
looked at s( hools with great academic programs, and
Stanford was the best of both worlds."
And now that she is here. Walker said she looks at
hci fellow Stanford students as the best part of being
011 the Farm.
"I think one of Ihe coolest things here is that 11011-
athletes respect you," Walker said. " I hey know tll.lt
yon didn't jusi gel here due to athletic skill, but thai
you were ac c epted first .is a student."
She is majoring in history with a minor in Russian
and Eastern European studies and wantstoattend law
school.
"She is always thinking," junior Sarah Beeson
said. "She is always a step ahead of everyone else on
the field."
A play that demonstrates Walker's cpiic k mind and
collected manner occurred in a game this season
against C )rcgon. I lie Ducks hit .1 ground ball to Walk
er, who initially misplaved the ball. It bounced off of
her glove, but, while everyone else 111 the stadium
groaned that the play at fiisi base was lost. Walker
cjiiic klv recovered the ball and tagged second base —
a second before the runner at first could get there.
Though many of her teammates c redit Walker as
perhaps the smartest player they have ever encoun
tered. it is the combination of her phy sic aland mental
game that cause many to refer to her as an unparal-
