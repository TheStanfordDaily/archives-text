# Baseball looking for revenge

I lit' pl.iu'i son ill*.* \i >. 7 Stanford baseball team
have .i couple limits to think alxmi right now.
First, there's tlu- final six facif'u 10 (Confer
ence games tli.it .ire looming the next two
weeks. I hen, there's the one-game deficit to
Southern (California in the rate foi the I'ae-10
title. And. then, there's that sho< king 12-M
non-conference loss to .1 Sacramento State
team thai hadn't beaten Stanfortl (S5-I3) in
ovei five \e.ll s.
I hat's .1 lot to kindle.
I lie team might want to !>c reminded,
then, of two more tilings that could he over

Don't think thc\ \e forgotten those two op
ponents so (|iii( k1 \. though.
Stanford has played pretty solid baseball
against non-conterence teams, going I <S-(»
against sin li opponents this year. Hut two of
those losses (.line at the hands of the two
teams the Cardinal will face this week, (al
folv and I SF.
After hosting the Mustangs at f>:00 p.lll.
tonight at Sunken Diamond, the ( animal will
travel up to Sail Francisco 011 \Vc(hiesda\ foi
one game. whi( li will st.n t.it 2:.50 p.m.
()ne would have to think wav hack to the be
ginning ol the scas(>n to let all the (»-. r » loss to (al
fol\ at Naggelt Stadium in the first game of the
season. In a four-and-a-half lioiu marathon,
the Mustangs won the game the bottom of the
I lit 11 inning when freshman relievci |olin
I ludgins walked in the winning run.
At the time, Stanford was ranked NO. I I in
the nation and tlid not have anywhere neai 1 lie
( hem Ist 1 \ 11 lias developed over the season.
However, the same tiling cannot be said
about the (Cardinal s loss to I si three weeks
ago. I he team had won IS of its List 20 games
before the 1 defeat In the Dons.
Stanford trailed, ~>-.'L m the bottom of the
eighth inning when it loaded the bases with
no outs. I he (Cardinal was onlv able to score
one run m the inning and was shut out in the
ninth en route to its eighth one-run loss ol
the scas(in.
Sureh none of the players want the same
results against these same two non-conlcr
eiM e teams this week. \nd two w ins would be
the perfect wa\ to kit k-siart a pot lion of the
season through which the (Cardinal has
seemed to sputter. Stanford has onl\ won live
(»l its last 10 games, and head coach Maik
Mai (|iiess has begun to make adjustments.
Freshman |onn\ Ash, who has gone ~>-01-()
111 the past two games, will most likeh be put
m the designated Inttet spot again toda\ to
help the (Cardinal generate more offense.
I lie starling pitchers have not vet been
11.lined, but 11 is likeh that the whole staff will
see some work, as head (oa( 11 \la 1 k Marquess
wants his three main starters, juniois |ell

Hruks(h and Mike (iosling and sophomort
|erctn\ (.inline, to get some test before tlm
weekend's set ies.
II the (Cardinal dominates the games this
week, then the loss to Sat ra men to State will be
a distant memory. II Stanford loses again,
though, then this weekend's series with An

/<mi.i will onh he that much toughei to plav.
Momentum in everything, and ii seems .is
though the | >la \ci s need lli.il extra surge
