Columnist wants
hockey to consider
his skills for playoffs
l <> whom n may concern:
Hi, my name is Ryan
Stewart, and I am
|)n//led In the lat k
o! talented l)l<u k atli
letes in the National Hockey
I .eague. Ati it an Amei it ans have
made tlit'ir mark <>i 1 ahnt)st
evei \ sport in the country except
litk kev. As a voting black male
who enjoys ilif game of hot kev,
I won It I like to sre the \ l 11. take
greatei sti itles to ret i nil and tle
velt>p talentetl All it an-Amci it .111
vonth into its minoi league and
top-level programs.

In order to
facilitate vom
tpiest it) be
more inclusive
in \Olll hiring
practices, I am
making mvsclf
available to all
ol the teams re
maining in the
plavofls foi this

vcai's Siank\ ( up. 1 would
have preferred to plav for the
St.us, hut because tliev just got
whipped like a red-headed
stepchild, I will take what I can
get. Oh, could \ou please not
send me to Canada? No offense
to (Canadians or anything, hut . .
. I mean . . . well, it's (ianada. I
don't end ni\ sentences with the
word "eh, I've never tailed
anvone .1 hoser. I hate beavers
.iihl French people scare inc.
lint am other team would he
fine.
On second thought, please
tia not to | >1 it me 011,1 team with
too main Fastern Furopeans.
I'm not a big lan of trving to pi o
iiouik e names from that region,
.md I would incvitablv end up
referring to mv teammates as
that "guv with cnrlv hair who
nevei showers.
Actually, now that I think
about it. New |erse\ smells like

garbage .tntl upstate New York
is boring and tot) cold. I hen
again, I don't like altitude, so
Colorado is out. St. Louis is a
Midwestern dumping ground,
and |aromir Jagr of the 1 itts
burgh I'enguins talks funny
So how about Lt>s Angtles?
Yeah, great, wliv don't von put
me tui L.A.
Nt>w I'm sure this letter
comes as a sin prise to von. Es;ie
t iallv this late in the season. Be
lieve me, this decision was not
made 111 haste. My choice to
forgo my remaining years of eli
gibility in college ice hot ke\ wis
something that mv coach and I
really had to take a long bar !
look at.
And the fact that I am on Â«lie
rugbv team and not on the ite
hot kev team only confused tilt
matter more. Mv t <>.k li just kepi
looking .it me with a blank state
and saying, "What the hell are
\<>n talking about? Ice hockey?"
But, behind the masked con
fusion, 1 could see the hurt 111 his
eyes as I told him that 1 needed
to make this move now. Not just
tor me, but lor .ill of my peopie.
I nlortunatelv, I have no
tapes of myself actualh plaving
hot kev for vou to evaluate, lint
I'm sure my talent will speak jot
itself tnice fin suited up and
have .1 chance to get into the
flow <>l the game. I haven't attu
ally ever played .1 game of ice
lint kev per sc. but I tlitl plaf a
game <>1 roller hotkey ii a
li lend s drivewav one time, ;ntl
there was definitely some poten
tial there. Also. I won my dti m
tournament 111 NHL 2000 lor
Playstation, and I'm pretty sate
a lot of those skills w ill transfer lo
the at tual game.
As for my skating skilly 1
think you'll be pleasantly sn
prisetl. While I haven't ice sl.at
ed in several years, I often
1 < illerblade arountl t am pus. I've
gotten it) the point where I tan
go down large hills with little or
no fear of falling down. 1 figured
that, since rollcrblading helped
