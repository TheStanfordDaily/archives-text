Technology Initiative, which introduces students to entrepeneurship in Asia.
I lie commission's task is to rc
loi m the Sex i.tl Sec 111 it\ program;
without am changes, the current
version ol the program would run

(>nc ol the main elements in
bush's platloi in w.is the relorin of
So( ial Sec urit\ through the c re
ation ol individual investment ac
counts.
I licse private accounts alone,
however, w ill not covet all of Social
Sccurih's expenses. Considering
Wall Street's recent roller-coaster
ride, cjuestions are also being
raised regarding the benefits of
making the prospect of retirement
benefits tine ei lain.
