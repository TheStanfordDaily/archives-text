### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President George W.
Bush created a new office yesterday to assess the na
tion's ability to deter terrorism and to coordinate «i
"harmonious and comprehensive" response to ter
rorist attacks, including those involving biological,
c hemical or nuc lear weapons.
"Prudence dictates that the I'nited States be
fully prepared to deal effectively with the conse
quences of su< ha weapon being used here on our
soil," the president said.
I he Federal F.inergcncv Management Agency,
the government bod\ that deals with floods, torna
dos and other natural disasters, will head the anti
terrorism effort through thenewl\ created (Mliceof
National Prep.u edness.
Bush also said his vice president will lead an
administration working group to assess terrorist
threats. Dick Ghenev, during a (INN interview,
said the team will "figure out how we best re
spond to thai kind oi disaster of major propor
tions that in effect would be manmadc or man
caused."
( hcnev's group was expec ted to report its find
ings to ( ongress bv ()ct. I. with the recommenda
tions to be reviewed by the National Security
(Council.
I lie announcements yesterday came as a
Senate panel held the first ot three days of hearings
on the subject.
" Fhe president's purpose is to bring clarity to
the f(') agencies that have a piece ot the pie," FFMA
director |oe Allbaugh told members of the Senate
Appropriate >11 s Subec>l limit tec on C < nnnicrce, | us
tice, State and the Judiciary.
"Preparedness is the key to everything, whether

you are talking about tornados or flooding or ter
rorism events," Allbaugh said. "I'm an old Boy
Scout, and I believe in the motto, Be Prepared.'
And the way we c an be prepared is to educate and
to train, particularly those who are the first respon
ders — those who put their lives at risk every day."
Allbaugh stressed that the office will serve only as
an organizer to make sure local and state agencies
are prepared for terrorism: "We are not a
deterrence agency, we are not in the intelli
gence business."
I he new office created some concern among
lawmakers who feared the effort might cause addi
tional confusion for local governments unsure of
who they must report to during an attack.
Many roles that will be examined by FEMA now
tall under the jurisdiction of the Justice Depart
ment or other federal agencies.
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., cited a training exer
cise conducted last year to gauge the ability to re
spond to a major terrorist attack. He said many
bodies' lay on the ground for hours while emer
gency workers tried to figure out "who was
in charge."
Allbaugh said that kind of problem will be
among those examined by his new office, as well as
('.heney's working group.
In additional to Allbaugh, other administration
officials appeared before the Senate panel to testify
about the increasing difficulty of combating terror
ism because of new technology and growing eco
nomic connections between nations.
Many senators expressed unhappiness with gov
ernment efforts to face the growing threats of bio
logical, chemical and nuclear weapons.
