BFIJING (AP) — China yesterday protest
ed the resumption of U.S. surveillance flights
and said it would refuse to let the United States
fly out a crippled Navy spy plane. I he Bush ad
ministration responded by stepping up its drive
to gel the plane back.
( lima has told Washington th.it "it is impos
sible for the U.S. FP-3 plane to fly back" to the
United States, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Sun Yuxi told the offi< i.il Xinhua news agency,
without saying why Beijing opposes a flight in
particular.
China has not ruled out allowing other
means to remove the damaged FP-3F Aries II
aircraft held on Hainan Island since ii collided
with a Chinese fighter jet. I he United States
has considered other options — su< Ii as dis
mantling the plane and shipping ii out in
pieces.
The matter could be properly settled if

Washington lakes a "pragmatic and construc
tive attitude." he said.
Sun also said that (Ihina would lodge "seri
ous protests m Washington over the resump
tion of surveillance flights, adding that the
I nitcd States should "correct such wrong-do
ings."
An unarmed Air Force RC-I'J5 flew along
China's northeastern coast Mondav, Pentagon
officials s.iid. the first surveillance mission since
the April I collision between the Navy spy plane
and tlie (Chinese jet fighter.
In Washington. Defense Secretary Donald
11. Rumsfeld said the administration had "onlv
very recently" received China's refusal of .1
flight out by the spy plane. The State Depart
ment would discuss the issue with the (Ihinese
Foreign Ministry, he said.
State Department spokesman Richard
Botichei said no option should be ruled out

that would ensure the quickest return ofthe re
connaissance plane.
"We are interested in the fastest return of the
airplane," Boucher said yesterday. "We think
that is in China's interest as well as ours."
Rumsfeld said the U.S. assessment team that
examined the Navy plane has "come to some
conclusions about what would be necessary to
handle the aircraft. And I have provided that
information to Secretary of State Powell."
Rumsfeld said Powell would have further
discussions with China, presumably through
the foreign ministry.
( hina's response came as relatives gathered
to mourn victims of NATO's bombing of the
( hinese Kmbassy in Yugoslavia two years ago.
The bombing sparked mass anti-American
protests nationwide. China has never accepted
I S. (laims that it was a mistake caused by faulty
targeting.
