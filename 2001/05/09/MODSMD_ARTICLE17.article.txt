TIIK WRITING PROGRAMS Review
(Committee's report to the Faculty Senate
last week recommended that students ad
mitted beginning in the spring of 2004 no
longer receive exemption from parts of the Uni
versity's writing requirement through Advanced
Placement test scores — instead, it suggested that
all students be required to take one ( lass during
freshman year and one class during sophomore
year, in addition to the Writing in the Major re
quirement. Many students already see little value in
the current program and these changes will do
nothing to improve it.
The committee argues that this proposal would
provide undergraduates with "access to a wide
range of writing environments and instruction in
working effectively in and with these environ
ments." I fowever, it is essential that, before trying to
expand the Writing and (Critical Thinking program
— or the Program in Writing and Rhetoric, a new
official name that lew students, even freshmen, rec-

ognize— the University work first to improve
upon the existing requirements.
Nearly all of Stanford's current undergraduates
have experienced at least one quarter of instruction
in tlie writing program. As is to be expected, stu
dents' reports on the effectiveness of the program
vary widely. ()ne common problem, however, is the
lack of consistency from (lass to class. W( CT instruc
tors represent a wide range in level of experience,
educational training and background, and this in
variably leads to an incredible range of teaching
styles .ind motivation. Asa result, some students sav
they have had a wonderful experience with their
WCT teacher, while others say their instructor
didn't provide adequate instruction at all. Addi
tionally, WCT course topics represent a huge vari
ety of disciplines, from popular culture topics to hu
manities-focused assignments.
Before attempting to reinvent the WCT pro
gram, the Writing Programs Review (Committee
should locus on eliminating these inconsistencies

so students receive comparable instruction. Fur
thermore, the statistics tlie committee cites to
support its proposal to overhaul the YVCT pro
grain seem .11 the very least obvious, it not faulty.
For instance, under the "Findings" section in the
proposal, the committee states that "70 percent of
student writing reviewed showed an improvement
from early to late samples." Shouldn't .til students
demonstrate improvement throughout the course
it the program is as el led ive as it is proclaimed to be,
especially with the dralt-and-review process built
into the \V( !T courses? (lertainly, there will be those
lew who don't improve, but it is alarming that the
committee uses this statistic to support its case. All
students should improve if, as \\'( 11 claims, they arc
subjected to regular consultation from ilicii in
structors and engage in a variety of writing and re
vising tasks. I Util this is achieved, it would be pre
mature to expand the program.
And what do those students who take their first
\V(T dass in spring of their freshman vear or later

gain from llit* experience? By this time in students'
Stanford careers, tJiey will have been expected to write
papers lor IntrodiK lion lo I hunanitiesor other cours
es that require using University libraries — which es
sentially eliminates the need for instruction in how to
use University resources, one of the program's lore
most goals. For W( T courses to be ellective, timing is
everything. Kither all freshmen should take a VVC'I
course during their first quarter at the University, or
the program should reconsider its goals.
It should be noted that the review committee ac
knowledges that the W(H program lias problems,
from inconsistency to poor student understanding
of the goals of the requirement. But the report
states that, rather than targeting these problems in
dividually, a substitute program should be imple
mented. This approach is questionable. I low can a
program be expanded when its foundation is
faulty? We strongly encourage the committee to
tackle these basic problems before becoming too
overzealous in reinvention.
