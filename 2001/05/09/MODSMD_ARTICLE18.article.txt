# LET FRIEDOM RING
## Time to start obsessing 
### 
This may sound cheesy, but bear
with me. The day 1 left for col
lege, my dad shared with me
three sin.ill words that would
haunt me for four years: "Find your passion."
From the letter of acceptance to the letter
asking me to give a Senior (lift, the Universi
ty has made "finding one's passion" tin inte
gral part of the Stanford experience.
So, many of us are patiently waiting for
our calling, the surreal moment when passion
just "finds us." However, since any attractive

"passion" would never
make the first move, we
must realize this is a form of
procrastination. For se
niors, there are approxi
mately five weeks left in
our college careers, and I
feel a sufficient procrasti
nation period has elapsed.
It's time for us to start
looking.

But where do we begin? Where do "pas
sions" hang out? And, when we find them,
how will we know which one belongs to
whom?
Being a student of comparative litera
ture, the first plate I turned was my trusty
dictionary. As it turns out, "passion" was a
Middle F.nglish word that meant "suffering."
It originally referred to — get this — the
sufferings of Christ between the night of the
List Supper and his death. ()y vey! I'm fair
ly sure <i thorny crown was not the passion to
which my dad was referring, so I quickly
moved on.
Google, the champagne of search engines,
was my next stop. Entering "passion" into the
search field gave me a short list of Christiani
ty-related sites and one link to Purple Pas
sion.com. I like all things purple, sans egg
plant, so I decided to check it out. "An ()nline
Catalog of Fetish Fashions in Leather, I .at ex,
PVC, Chain Mail and Patent Leather" await
ed me. Tantalizing, but too tight and sweaty
for this recent heat wave.
Not to be denied, I typed "my passion" into
the search engine. Maybe (ioogle just needed
to know whit h passion to look for! The result?
Birthljove.com, a Web site th.it proclaims,
"The passion of mothering is not .» New Age
idea ... it's a Stone Age absolute." Might be
someone else's passion, I thought, but logisti
cally speaking this one's not going to work.
Obsessed with having (ioogle find me a
suitable passion, I did yet another search
using the specific phrase, "Josh's passion."
Suddenly, between Web sites describing
"Josh's passion for good beer and brewing"
and "josh's passion for the defunct Pittsburgh
Hornets," it hit me. Passion would only get

me so far — what 1 needed w.is an obsession.
What we all need are obsessions.
Oui society was founded with .1 competi
tive spirit that produces and rewards those
obsessed with achieving suet ess. There will al
ways be winners and losers in our world, and
this mentality ensures that sooner or later
passion won't be enough. Without an obses
sion, you're a step behind.
The people who make the biggest dents in
the car door that is this world are obsessed
with something, lhe best and most well
known doctors, lawyers, leat hers, managers,
actors, singers, writers, thinkers and athletes
are all obsessed with what they do. Sure, there
are passionate people everywhere doing
many impoi taut tilings, but they don't hold a
candle to the gemiineh obsessed.
Devoted people give their passions many
hours of attention, but obsessions are all-con
suming. l he guy who is passionate about toi
let ting Star Wars action figures will always lose
out to that other guv who is obsessed with own
ing every last one. And the girl who feels the
11.lines of passion fora cute classmate will al
ways end up watching him get gobbled up by
that other girl who's obsessed with meeting
him.
beyond material and romantit success,
obsession can mean the difference between
life and death. 1 just saw "Cast Away" at Flicks,
and it occurred to me afterwards that Tom
I l.inks'st hai at ter didn't survive his island or
deal because he was passionate about life or
survival. Me was simply obsessed with seeing
his wife one last time. Nothing could come be
tween him and this driving obsession.
('.onvet selv, obsession can be deadly. Not
all obsessions involve the preservation of life.
For example, Timothy McVeigh is scheduled
to be executed next Wednesday for the 1995
bombing of the ()klahoma (lity federal build
ing that killed lf»H people. If McVeigh had
displayed a mere passionate hatred of the
I S. government, rather than an obsession
wit li its demise, would he have committed this
atrocity? Probably not. But regardless of what
he tlid. that act gave his life meaning.
Whether we like it or not, those of us with
out an obsession will fall by the wayside. But
we don't have to go unnoticed. In fact, we can
pass for obsession -seekers whenever we want.
I do this all the time. When someone sug
gests that I "find my passion" nowadays, I
proudly let him or her know what I'm up to.
"Actually, I'm looking for my obsession ...
huh? No, not the cologne ... ah, never
mind."

This may sound cheesy, but bear
with me. The day 1 left for col
lege, my dad shared with me
three sin.ill words that would
haunt me for four years: "Find your passion."
From the letter of acceptance to the letter
asking me to give a Senior (lift, the Universi
ty has made "finding one's passion" tin inte
gral part of the Stanford experience.
So, many of us are patiently waiting for
our calling, the surreal moment when passion
just "finds us." However, since any attractive

"passion" would never
make the first move, we
must realize this is a form of
procrastination. For se
niors, there are approxi
mately five weeks left in
our college careers, and I
feel a sufficient procrasti
nation period has elapsed.
It's time for us to start
looking.

But where do we begin? Where do "pas
sions" hang out? And, when we find them,
how will we know which one belongs to
whom?
Being a student of comparative litera
ture, the first plate I turned was my trusty
dictionary. As it turns out, "passion" was a
Middle F.nglish word that meant "suffering."
It originally referred to — get this — the
sufferings of Christ between the night of the
List Supper and his death. ()y vey! I'm fair
ly sure <i thorny crown was not the passion to
which my dad was referring, so I quickly
moved on.
Google, the champagne of search engines,
was my next stop. Entering "passion" into the
search field gave me a short list of Christiani
ty-related sites and one link to Purple Pas
sion.com. I like all things purple, sans egg
plant, so I decided to check it out. "An ()nline
Catalog of Fetish Fashions in Leather, I .at ex,
PVC, Chain Mail and Patent Leather" await
ed me. Tantalizing, but too tight and sweaty
for this recent heat wave.
Not to be denied, I typed "my passion" into
the search engine. Maybe (ioogle just needed
to know whit h passion to look for! The result?
Birthljove.com, a Web site th.it proclaims,
"The passion of mothering is not .» New Age
idea ... it's a Stone Age absolute." Might be
someone else's passion, I thought, but logisti
cally speaking this one's not going to work.
Obsessed with having (ioogle find me a
suitable passion, I did yet another search
using the specific phrase, "Josh's passion."
Suddenly, between Web sites describing
"Josh's passion for good beer and brewing"
and "josh's passion for the defunct Pittsburgh
Hornets," it hit me. Passion would only get

me so far — what 1 needed w.is an obsession.
What we all need are obsessions.
Oui society was founded with .1 competi
tive spirit that produces and rewards those
obsessed with achieving suet ess. There will al
ways be winners and losers in our world, and
this mentality ensures that sooner or later
passion won't be enough. Without an obses
sion, you're a step behind.
The people who make the biggest dents in
the car door that is this world are obsessed
with something, lhe best and most well
known doctors, lawyers, leat hers, managers,
actors, singers, writers, thinkers and athletes
are all obsessed with what they do. Sure, there
are passionate people everywhere doing
many impoi taut tilings, but they don't hold a
candle to the gemiineh obsessed.
Devoted people give their passions many
hours of attention, but obsessions are all-con
suming. l he guy who is passionate about toi
let ting Star Wars action figures will always lose
out to that other guv who is obsessed with own
ing every last one. And the girl who feels the
11.lines of passion fora cute classmate will al
ways end up watching him get gobbled up by
that other girl who's obsessed with meeting
him.
beyond material and romantit success,
obsession can mean the difference between
life and death. 1 just saw "Cast Away" at Flicks,

I l.inks'st hai at ter didn't survive his island or
