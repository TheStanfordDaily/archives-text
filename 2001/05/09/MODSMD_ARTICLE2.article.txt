## 
### MELISANDE MIDDLETON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the trout page of its April 18 issiu-,
rite Stanford Review published a headline
that read I he Ad 1 he Daily Didn't Want
You lb See." It was introducing David
IJorowit/'s controversial advei tisetnent:
" I en Reasons Whv Reparations for Slavery
is a Had Idea — and Racist loo."
I lowever, I he Review had not < ommuni
eated with Hie Stanford Dailv about the ad
vertisement. "We spoke directly with
I lorowit/'s office and we viewed «i Web sile-.
11ms, we knew that it was public and accu
rate information that I he I )ail\ had rejected
the ad," said sophomore Matt Barrett, editor
in chief of The Review.
"I actually pointed that out io a guv from
I he Review who was tabling for Admit
Weekend, with copies of thai issue spread
out .ill over the table. I (old him I he DaiK
was going to publish the ad — which I knew
because I had heard from some of the folks
writing the response — and asked whelhei
they had contacted the DaiK before writing
the article, but he just sort of shrugged," se
nior I ouise Auei halm said.
Daily staffers say thev were planning on
printing the advertisement. "We decided to
run Horowit/'s advertisement as guest col
umn. alongside a response- column from the
IMack Student I nion, in the Opinions sec -
tion of I "lie 4 )aily," said junior Nadira Hit a,
editoi in chief of The Dailv, in the Mav 2
issue in which the advertisement appeared.
Running the advertisement alongside a
response column seemed appropriate for
such controversial subject matter, I lira said.
"We hoped . . . that ibis decision would
prove both to our commit nit v and to peo pie
across the country that serious issues can be

discussed in a constructive way and, more
importantb, that university newspapers,
and I he DaiK in particular, can provide an
excellent forum for thai discussion," she
continued.
I lira said "some would argue that the use
of the word 'ad' in the headline made the
statement true — because I he Daily did in
fac I reject the ad, choosing instead to i nil the
content ,is a guest column. I he fact re
mains that, as journalists, we ought lo
deal in timli and clarity, not seman
tics and sensationalism."

Senior Ajainu Kitwana. Co-chair of the
USI .said of I lorowit/'s advertisement, "I was
offended, but I couldn't take [the advertise
ment! seriously. I was in disbelief thai some
one- would have such views. Ii seemed that
there u.is an intention lo be inflammatory
and to ( reale an uproar on campus."

Kilwana said. "H\ the- time |thc ad] got to
Stanford, we had thought it through. I lie
most productive thing we could do was bring
dialogue and put in a voice of reason and
more sound arguments."
Kitwana said he appreciated how Ihe
DaiK handled the situation. "Thc\ ran 11 be
at 11 as a guest column because I hey didn't
want to receive money fbi it. I 'his gave us a
chance to turn il into a dialogue [and) to make

an uproar out of the campus community."
He said priming ihe IVSI response col
