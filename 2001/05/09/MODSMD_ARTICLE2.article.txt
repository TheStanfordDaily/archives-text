# Reparations ad promotes discussion, controversy
## 
### MELISANDE MIDDLETON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the trout page of its April 18 issiu-,
rite Stanford Review published a headline
that read I he Ad 1 he Daily Didn't Want
You lb See." It was introducing David
IJorowit/'s controversial advei tisetnent:
" I en Reasons Whv Reparations for Slavery
is a Had Idea — and Racist loo."
I lowever, I he Review had not < ommuni
eated with Hie Stanford Dailv about the ad
vertisement. "We spoke directly with
I lorowit/'s office and we viewed «i Web sile-.
11ms, we knew that it was public and accu
rate information that I he I )ail\ had rejected
the ad," said sophomore Matt Barrett, editor
in chief of The Review.
"I actually pointed that out io a guv from
I he Review who was tabling for Admit
Weekend, with copies of thai issue spread
out .ill over the table. I (old him I he DaiK
was going to publish the ad — which I knew
because I had heard from some of the folks
writing the response — and asked whelhei
they had contacted the DaiK before writing
the article, but he just sort of shrugged," se
nior I ouise Auei halm said.
Daily staffers say thev were planning on
printing the advertisement. "We decided to
run Horowit/'s advertisement as guest col
umn. alongside a response- column from the
IMack Student I nion, in the Opinions sec -
tion of I "lie 4 )aily," said junior Nadira Hit a,
editoi in chief of The Dailv, in the Mav 2
issue in which the advertisement appeared.
Running the advertisement alongside a
response column seemed appropriate for
such controversial subject matter, I lira said.
"We hoped . . . that ibis decision would
prove both to our commit nit v and to peo pie
across the country that serious issues can be

discussed in a constructive way and, more
importantb, that university newspapers,
and I he DaiK in particular, can provide an
excellent forum for thai discussion," she
continued.
I lira said "some would argue that the use
of the word 'ad' in the headline made the
statement true — because I he Daily did in
fac I reject the ad, choosing instead to i nil the
content ,is a guest column. I he fact re
mains that, as journalists, we ought lo
deal in timli and clarity, not seman
tics and sensationalism."

Daily staffers say thev were planning on
printing the advertisement. "We decided to
run Horowit/'s advertisement as guest col

editoi in chief of The Dailv, in the Mav 2
issue in which the advertisement appeared.
Running the advertisement alongside a
response column seemed appropriate for
such controversial subject matter, I lira said.
"We hoped . . . that ibis decision would
prove both to our commit nit v and to peo pie
across the country that serious issues can be

discussed in a constructive way and, more
importantb, that university newspapers,
and I he DaiK in particular, can provide an
excellent forum for thai discussion," she
continued.

of the word 'ad' in the headline made the

deal in timli and clarity, not seman
