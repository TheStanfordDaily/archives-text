Graduate students offer perspectives
on housing problems
(liven Monday's editorial 011 graduate
housing ("Housing crunch net essitates un
popular solution"), we ask I he Daily and its
readers to consider the following graduate
student perspec lives.
Kot a variety of personal .uui academic
reasons, many of which have been dis
cussed in the 1998 ASSU (>raduate Hous
ing Report, graduate students have always
overwhelmingly opposed assignment of
more than one person or couple per bed
room in graduate housing. I his is c(]ti.illv
true for graduate students who live off cam
pus and would be able to move on campus
if such assignments were made.
Most of us are financially independent
adults. Many are returning professionals,
and many have spouses or partners who
visit frequently but do not cohabit pel ina
nently. We require more space and pri
vacy than a dormitory-like arrangement
can offer.
For the record, we note that the Univer
sity does plan to build more graduate hous
ing. The General Use Permit calls for the
construction of nearly 2,000 units and does
not forbid additional housing.
We appreciate The Daily's concern re
garding graduate housing. We encourage
The Daily to make a special effort to learn
about graduate student issues by speaking
with graduate students and learning more
about our situation. The Daily's coverage of
graduate issues would be much more useful

University 'needs to examine the relative
worth of its graduate students'
Bayle Shanks' response to Monday's edi
torial ("Increasing housing occupancy not
the solution") advocates admitting fewer
graduate students. Although 1 understand
this option has been examined by adminis
trators and rejected for various reasons, I
agree with Shanks. I also suggest a sort of re
distribution of graduate housing. Using .1
draw to indiscriminately offer students hous
ing is unfair to doctoral candidates and grad
uate students in the humanities. Also, grant
ing priority to first-year students is unfair to
those going beyond a master's degree.
According to the data provided in the

Stanford Direc tory, there are 7(i5 graduate
students in electrical engineering, 4(>S in
mechanic al engineering and 4f>H in comput
er science. A large percentage of these stu
dents are obtaining short-term master's de -
grees, only so that they may return to the
work world with a higher earnings potential
— off-campus housing should be a cost of
their strategic < areer move. Compare this to
graduate students in Italian, eight in French,
Hi in religious studies or even the 57 in his
tory. Most of these students will be at Stan
ford upwards of six years, only to obtain
upon their departure c luonicalh underpaid
professorships in the humanities.
Are master's students in engineering —
many of whom are using their program not as
<i springboard to a doctorate but simply as a
professional degree like a master's in business
administration —as valuable to the I niversi
ty's intellectual community as doc total candi
dates in Italian literature? Why shouldn't the
S< hool of Engineering be expec ted to build
housing for its pre-professional graduate stu
dents, just as the (Iraduate School of Business
has for its MBA candidates?
Quite frankly, the University needs to ex
amine the relative worth of its graduate stu
dents. Should we provide computer pro
grammers itching fora higher salary with
our far-below-market housing rates, espe
cially when we deny them to those who will
make a life-long contribution to academia
and the search to know?
