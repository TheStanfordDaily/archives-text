Clan science lie fun on a Saturday
morning? Over ISO fourth- and fifth
graders from the Bay Area had some on
May at the Society of Women Engi
neers sixth annual "Exploring New
Worlds." .111 engineering day held for el
emental v school children.
I he kids came from six elementary
schools in San Jose, Redwood City and
Fremont. "We focused on schools with
low test scores, said Brenna Hearn, a
sophomore and a Society of Women En
gineers offit er.
I he e\ cut began with the part it ipants'
,nrival in the morning, after which they
cat h attended three of the 15 workshops
that were offered.
" I he workshops teach many important
sc ientifii principles," saitl Rachel (ierver, a
junior majoring in electrical engineering
mil .1 workshop coordinator.
I itanit teat lies [the kids] about
buoyancy, in '()t»blet k the\ hat! to play
with starch and water to learn about
lorcc, and the 'Leaning Tower of Pasta'
uses marshmallow and spaghetti to tle
s( i ibe gravity." she explained.
I he workshops were letl by 30 Stan
lord fatuity and studrnts, including
['.omputer Science Prof. Patrick Young
iiicl Chemistry Prof. |onathan I ouster.
m\i\ atltlilional yolunteers helped out
v iili the event.
Eucero Aguillar, (linthya \ ieira and
\lit helle (iootlins, three stutlents from
Kaii ()aks Elementary in Redwood
it\. agreetl in their assessment of the
•vent. "We liketl [the workshops]. The
Inn with Nitrogen' experiment was
rall\ tun," tliev saitl. "We got to use

our imagination and
tit) things we like. It
is a tun way of doing
science."
Aftei lunch, the
children pai ticipatcd
in a role-pla vin g
competition in
groups of four. Each
person assumed a
different role — ma
terials engineer, in
tl list rial engineer,
civil engineer and en
vironmental engi
neer — as they tried
to built! a bridge
across the San Fran
cisco Bay.
"We are really ex
cited about i he com
petition. We haven't
built a suspension
bridge before,"
Tony Eor, a student
from Rogers Ele
mentary School in
San Jose, saitl.
Alexis Wallen, a
sophomore major
ing in chemical engi
neering and one of
the coordinators for
Exploring New
Worlds, said, "We
have been working
on this project for
many months. We
contacted 50 schools
.intl manv local
sponsors to obtain
funding."
Wallen atltletl

that moving from Eernian Engineer
ing, where the event was held lasl
year, to Sequoia 1111 n vear and having
a better workshop-to-pai tit ipant
ratio were positive changes. "It is
good to see our effort bearing re
sults." she saitl.

"I loved it," Christina (iranando, a
tca( her at Roosevelt Klementarv in Red
wood C.itv, said. "1 came here last vear,
.md it keeps improving. Ihe students do
hands-on learning while interacting with
positive role models."
Melania juardado, one ol the partic i

pants parents, agreed. "I enjoved it very
innch. I he children arc asking verv good
questions and are reallv involved. 1 he in
structors and volunteers deserve a
tlnimbs-up."
" 1 his is my first time, and I will defi
nitely come next vear," |nardado added.

Jennifer Schnlty, a second-year
doctoral candidate in chemical engi
neering and a volunteer, said she be
lieved the program is a good one.
" I lie best thing was hearing one of the
teachers say she will use the work
shops in her classes," she said.
