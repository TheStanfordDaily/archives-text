volves around

building fast and reliable wireless networks, and it
has mam applications. " The [Sloan Fellowship]
mone\ is not targeted for anv spec ific project or
projee ts," (ioldsmith said, "but will be used to fund
new students while they are identifying which pro
jet tsand ideas to puisne, as well as for travel to con
ferences .ind other universities to present our ideas
in all of these areas."
In addition to being recognized .is an excclient re
searcher. Goldsmith is also a mentor and resource
foi bet graduate students. Kevin Yu, a doctoral c an
didate in electrical engineering and one of Gold
smith's students, expressed satisfaction with how
Goldsmith distributes her research funds. "She's
ver\ good about resources," he s.iid. "She'll use her
fuiuliiig if \ou need something and it's reasonable.
She's open to spending whatever it takes to provide
us with the nccessarv tools.
\ianghcng Liu, another electrical engineering
doctoral candidate in Goldsmith's research group,
described the professor as a taring adviser. "She
gives us very good mentoring in almost even part of
student life," Liu said. When asked about (.old
smith's abilit\ to inspire students, Yu said. "She man
ages to motivate vou to do work without it feeling
like she's pressuring you. I can't figure out how she
does that, but it's really good. You don't feel pres
sured. but vou always make steady progress."
Yu works with (ioldsmith on improving data
rates and reliabilitv in wireless networks, (an tenth.

conventional wired networks transmit data about
KM) times more (|in< kl\ than wireless s\stems.
Goldsmith saitl tli.it adding more antennas to
wireless s\stems is one wa\ to narrow this gap. "It
vou get one megabit pet second with one transmit
atul-reccive antenna. \<>u could potentially get 10

megabits per set -
ond with ten anten
nas on each side —
although that in
creases the com
plexity loi process
ing," she said.
Another possible
solution is adapting
ilit* transmission
rate to at(<unit for
< lianges in the un
predictable envi
ronment of out -

door spate that functions .is the communication
channel fora wireless link.
"When your channel is favorable, vou can send
more data, and, when its less favorable, you can
sent! less data." < ioldsmith said. "()n the average vou
get a higher data rate, and vou're also not fighting
against a bad channel, so voui reliability is im
proved . . . With .ill these wireless users sharing the
same bandwidth and interfering with each other,
| vou need to] manage \ < uii resources in an adaptive
w.n. so th.it cvei votic gets a high data rate."
In another effort to improve data rates and relia-
I)ilit \. (ioldsmith s resean h group is looking into re
designing the ph\si( al sending of video or voice sig
nals so that it is less sensitive to < lianges in the un
derlying wireless network.
Working togethci with (.oldsmith and Galtrans,
Liu is developing a controller for the Automated
Highway Systems Project. Hoping to make traffic
move more tjux kl \ and effit icntlv. ( .illrails plans to
eventually automate one lane of highway traffic.
"Basically what happens is you drive onto the
highway, t.ike your hands off the wheel and. via a
wireless tommunk ation link, your car links up into
what's called a platoon of vehicles," Goldsmith ex
plained. " 1 here'll be five to eight vchit les in each
platoon, driving along, w lii( li c an change lanes and
intcrat I with other platoons. I lien you get to your
destination and break ofl and get control of your
