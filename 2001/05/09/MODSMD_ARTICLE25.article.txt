volves around

building fast and reliable wireless networks, and it
has mam applications. " The [Sloan Fellowship]
mone\ is not targeted for anv spec ific project or
projee ts," (ioldsmith said, "but will be used to fund
new students while they are identifying which pro
jet tsand ideas to puisne, as well as for travel to con
ferences .ind other universities to present our ideas
in all of these areas."
In addition to being recognized .is an excclient re
searcher. Goldsmith is also a mentor and resource
foi bet graduate students. Kevin Yu, a doctoral c an
didate in electrical engineering and one of Gold
smith's students, expressed satisfaction with how
Goldsmith distributes her research funds. "She's
ver\ good about resources," he s.iid. "She'll use her
fuiuliiig if \ou need something and it's reasonable.
She's open to spending whatever it takes to provide
us with the nccessarv tools.
\ianghcng Liu, another electrical engineering
doctoral candidate in Goldsmith's research group,
described the professor as a taring adviser. "She
gives us very good mentoring in almost even part of
student life," Liu said. When asked about (.old
smith's abilit\ to inspire students, Yu said. "She man
ages to motivate vou to do work without it feeling
like she's pressuring you. I can't figure out how she
does that, but it's really good. You don't feel pres
sured. but vou always make steady progress."
Yu works with (ioldsmith on improving data
rates and reliabilitv in wireless networks, (an tenth.

conventional wired networks transmit data about
KM) times more (|in< kl\ than wireless s\stems.
Goldsmith saitl tli.it adding more antennas to
wireless s\stems is one wa\ to narrow this gap. "It
vou get one megabit pet second with one transmit
atul-reccive antenna. \<>u could potentially get 10

megabits per set -
ond with ten anten
nas on each side —
although that in
creases the com
plexity loi process
ing," she said.
Another possible
solution is adapting
ilit* transmission
rate to at(<unit for
< lianges in the un
predictable envi
ronment of out -

door spate that functions .is the communication
channel fora wireless link.
"When your channel is favorable, vou can send
more data, and, when its less favorable, you can
sent! less data." < ioldsmith said. "()n the average vou
get a higher data rate, and vou're also not fighting
against a bad channel, so voui reliability is im
proved . . . With .ill these wireless users sharing the
same bandwidth and interfering with each other,
| vou need to] manage \ < uii resources in an adaptive
w.n. so th.it cvei votic gets a high data rate."
In another effort to improve data rates and relia-
I)ilit \. (ioldsmith s resean h group is looking into re
designing the ph\si( al sending of video or voice sig
nals so that it is less sensitive to < lianges in the un
derlying wireless network.
Working togethci with (.oldsmith and Galtrans,
Liu is developing a controller for the Automated
Highway Systems Project. Hoping to make traffic
move more tjux kl \ and effit icntlv. ( .illrails plans to
eventually automate one lane of highway traffic.
"Basically what happens is you drive onto the
highway, t.ike your hands off the wheel and. via a
wireless tommunk ation link, your car links up into
what's called a platoon of vehicles," Goldsmith ex
plained. " 1 here'll be five to eight vchit les in each
platoon, driving along, w lii( li c an change lanes and
intcrat I with other platoons. I lien you get to your
destination and break ofl and get control of your

car back."
When asked how she tell about relinquish
ing control ol her own tar, (ioldsmith said,
"This is a system you would buy into. You
would buy a cat that's equipped tor this, but
you'd certainly be welcome to sit in bumper-to
bumper traffic il you're not comfortable with it.
I'm going to wait .1 few years before I try it out.
I think it's an excellent idea and that it would be
.1 real technolc>gical feat."
Another exciting application of (iold
smith's work is the ad hoc wireless network.
Imagine .1 sensoi netwoi k composed <>112 tiny

disposable devices. "You could take 100,000
sensors and throw them out the window of
an airplane to measure the water content of
soil in an agricultural application," (iold
smith said.
However, when a network is composed of
many wirelessly enabled devices and multiple
hubs but has no central base station, it's hard
er to control operations. "It's like a democra
cy (ioldsmith said. Small sensors are also like
ly to have very limited battery power. "So how
do you form a network from all of these vari
ous devices," she asked. "And what kind of
data rates, reliabilities and performance can
you expect.-" A host of problems must be
solved before effective ad hoc wireless net
works can be realized, (ioldsmith said.
Lastly, (ioldsmith is leading a project with
seven other electrical engineering professors
on multi-layered mobile networking for the

Stanford Networking Research (.enter. Hie
group is looking at a wide range ot issues relat
ed to multimedia communication via wireless,
including application design, modulation am I
encoding.
Because conventional networks are ver\ r<
liable, the Internet has multimedia capabilities
"As soon as you begin to look .it trying to pro
vide Internet-like capabilities with a wireless
channel, the underlying assumptions all
change because the channel is so bad,' Gold
smith said. "You really have to rethink the wax
you do the network design."
In 1934, Alfred l\ Sloan |r., at that time the
chief executive officer of General Motors Cor
poration, established his non-profit philan
thropic foundation. Kach year, the nation s top
young scientists, economists and educators re
ceive grants from the Sloan Foundation's $1.3
billion fund.
