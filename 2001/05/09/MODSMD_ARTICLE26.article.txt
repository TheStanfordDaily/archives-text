Ncarb one-fifth of the people
who (.ill the Bridge for counsel
ing sa\ difficulties in their rela-

tionships with sig
nify ant ot hers,
friends and family
are iheii most seri
ous concerns.
Given one wish iu
life, many people
would wish to be
loved uncondition
ally — to feel safe
whether they are
disclosing vulnera
bilities or letting
out a fart. To be

able to reveal yourself complete
ly to another human being, how
ever. requires trust and emotion
al risk-taking.
For most of us, building inti
macy begins in childhood. Psy
chologist John liowlby of the
I avistock ( lime in London, and
his student, Mary S. Ainsworth,
of the University of Virginia,
were early proponents of the at
tachment theory, which claims
that infants attach to one or two
adult figures iu their lives and
are comforted by their presence
and distressed by their absence.
At that early stage in our lives,
trust develops naturally. Unless
we learn that our parental figures
are unreliable, we will form a se
cure attachment to them. Our
confidence in their protection
empowers us to explore our envi
ronments. to acquire competen
cies and to develop autonomy.
If for whatever reason our
trust is breathed, problems arise.
A series of experiments conduct
ed by psychologist Kim CJiisholm
of St. Francis Xavier University
assessed the overall well-being of

babies who had lived at least eight
months in a Romanian orphan
age that provided exceptional
physical c are and rcc national ac -
tivities but pool' social contact.

1 he results indicated significant
delays in emotional, motor, social,
speech and physical development
in these c hildrcn, as well as learn
ing difficulties and behavioral
problems.
As we grow older, we develop
other relationships. Iu our indi
vidualistic society, however, an in
creasing emphasis is placed on
personal goals — to excel iu
school and work and to gain fame
and fortune. With so much time
devoted to the pursuit of these
goals, our dedication to nurtur
ing rich and genuine relation
ships suffers. Fhe competitive
ness decreases our altruism to
ward others. We also tend to be
less trustful of people, and, with
out trust and compassion, intima
cy shrivels.
()ne senior commented on the
shallowness of some of the
friendships she has observed at
Stanford. "I've seen these people
in niv dorm put their arms
around my best friend when it
was convenient for them," she
said. "()tlicr times, they wouldn't
even mention her name. And

they wouldn't he there for her if
she really needed them."
At times, it seems the more sta
tus your career affords you, the
more superficial many of your

relationships be
come. Much of your
time may be spent
networking with as
sociates who can
provide advantages
for you in the fu
ture.
However, the
numerous calls to
the Bridge regard
ing relationships
suggest that, to
Stanford students at

least, intimacy is still important.
Although taking the risk of con
fiding in and relying on someone
else seems much scarier now than
when we were younger, intimacy
is still a worthwhile goal.
A number of psychological
studies, including one by Kristin
A. Kullgren at Georgia State
I niversity conducted on chil
dren infected with HIV, confirm
th.it the emotional safety net af
forded by a loved one whom you
trust can help buffer stresses
from academics, physical and
mental illness, low self-esteem,
parental substance abuse, dis
crimination and a variety of
other life crises.
But you have to be willing to
work for intimacy in your life.
One common assumption that
lures people into stagnancy and
complacency is that intimacy will
flourish without special atten
tion. that it will happen it you
just want it bad enough. Those
who have this expectation often
become sorely disappointed

when it Tails to ok in in their re
lationships. If you want intiin.K \
to thrive in your life, you have to
work for it as much as you work
for A's in your classes.
It helps to be aware of what inti
macy is. Jerry Talley, a former so
ciology professor who often speaks
about relationships at dormitorx
functions, wrote an article on the
"Components of Intimacy" for the
course reader used in Kducation
193, the training class for Bridge
peer counselors. In the arti< le, lie
describes several components that
contribute to a vital relationship.
Most people are versed in
the intensely giddying yet un
stable feelings of romantic inii

macv, <is well as the sensual as
pcct of relationships. Another
familiar component in many
relationships is practical inti
mac v, where the couple works
together to make dec isions that
affect both partners, such as
making a budget.
(lompaniouatc intimacy is a sta
ble and lasting camaraderie that
usualh characterizes friendships
more than romantic relationships,
lint it can provide a solid founda
tion for the latter. Soc lal intimacy
refers to the level of interconnect
edness of the couple's social net
works. If a c ouplc lacks social inti
inacv, they tend to have two very
sepai ate sets of friends.
(.motional intimacy appears
less frequently in relationships.
It constitutes coinage in ex
pressing feelings that reveal
trust and, perhaps less intu
itive, sell-liking. If von are < om

fortahle with vour own short
comings and idiosyncrasies, it
will be much easier for someone
else to do the same. An intima
cy with the self facilitates inti
macy with others.
People quite often mistake
one dimension of intimacy for
another, like romantic passion
for emotional intimacy or practi
cal intimacy for companionate.
I hey also assume that one di
mension will augment or gener
ate another.
One common mistake is to
hope that a sexual relationship
with another person will en
courage him or her to cultivate
intimacy in other areas. Many
first-timers in the Draw
process may also hold the
naive belief that they will be
able to successfully share the
same physical space together
with their best friend.

So what can von do to foster
intimacy in your life? Simply
being more aware of what inti
macy entails will help you realize
ili.it sometimes the problem of
not feeling loved is related to the
effort you put into loving. Sepa
rating the components of inli
macy makes il easier to recog
nize which areas need addition
al effort. I hen you can acquire
and develop skills of intimacy di
rectly related to these domains.
Another key step is to learn
more about cultural differences
in expressing intimacy. Open
and honest communication with
your partner, as well as with
yourself, will help to establish
what both of you are comfortable
with. Then go for it!
