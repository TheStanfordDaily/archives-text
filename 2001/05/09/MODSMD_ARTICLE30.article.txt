# Dust storms not at fault for global warming

A press release from NASA's God
da rd Might Center in (ireenbelt,
M(l., suggests llit' dust in lilt- atmos
phere caused bv Saharan dust storms
doesn't have as large an effect on
gl< >bal wanning as was once lielieved.
In previous studies, it was thought
that desn t dust absorbed approxi
mate!) 10 to 1") |K'ixeiit of sunlight in
the visible to near infrared range. I bis
was thought to have eontributed to
the problem of global warming.
I lie researchers on the pre
sent team are confident that the
dn.si absorbs much less radiation
than previously thought. I'hotos
taken in 1987 from NASA's Land
sat :> spacecraft help prove the
point. Spe< ial photos thai record
solar radiation were taken ol
Senegal two weeks apart, one
during a sandstorm and the other
on .i clear afternoon.
I lie\ found there was not a sig
nificant difference in the radiation
emitted lu< k into space, indicating
thai the absorption of dust pani
cles is not as significant as was once
believed.
Another experiment, done 12
years later oil the coast of Senegal
at the ( ape Verde Islands,
proved that more conclusively. A
sun photometer was used to mea
sure how much radiation was
reaching the ground during a
(lust storm.
Based on the patterns of light
observed, scientists were able to
calculate particle size and their
absorption properties. They also
found the absorptive properties
to be far weaker than previously
thought.
The May issue of Nature Ge
netics details scientists' attempts to
return sight to blind puppies
through gene therapy. In humans
and a breed of dogs known as bri
ards, a gene called RPE6S pro

duces .i protein that helps nourish
and remove waste from the retinal
pigment epithelium cell layer of
the eye.
When this gene is mutated,
a mutant protein is formed,
which causes early vision loss,
degeneration of the retina
and, eventually, complete
blindness.
In the experiment, dogs known
to suffer from the retinal degener
ative disease were injected with a
combination of RPK6S genes that
were cloned from normal dogs
and a viral vector to carry the nor
mal dog's I)NA. Within six weeks,
the eyes ol the dogs receiving
treatment were producing the cor
rect RPE6S protein, and three
months later vision had been com
pletely restored.
This was the first time that vi
sion was restored through gene
therapy in a large animal. There
are no plans to use this proce
dure as treatment for these dogs
in the future because of its high
cost, however. (And, in most cir
cumstances, the disease has been
bred out of the dog family any
way). The hope is that the suc
cess in dogs will carry over to
human clinical trials, creating
hope for those who suffer from
this disorder.
