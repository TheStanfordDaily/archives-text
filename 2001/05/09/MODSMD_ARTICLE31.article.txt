# Bird-watching finds devoted adherents in profs, students alike

### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
I hose Fast Coast ignoramuses who refer to
us as the "Stanford Cardinals" would have
done well to visit the recent exposition of bird
drawings by Darvl VVheye at the Faculty (Hub,
part of a show that just closed. There, they
might have learned that, while the cardinal
bird has never been spotted in Santa Clara
(lount), our fait campus houses over 150 other
bird species, to nature and bird-lovers' delight.
I he exposition included artistic renditions
ol such commonh sighted birds .is the acorn
woodpet ker and the California towhee, as well
as more rareh seen birds, such as the white
throated sparrow.
It is a beautiful exposition," said
josephina Duron-Bergnar, a staff member
.u tlie Faculty Club."The pictures are spe
cial because they remind people of the
beaut v around t hem."
Stanford abounds not only with birds, but
also with bird-buffs. They include such nota
bles as former University President Donald
Kennedy, Biological Sciences Prof. Paul
Fhrlic h, Law Prof, Thomas Grey and Law Prof.
Michael Wald, just to name a few.
In his campus plan of I<SHK, Frederick Law
Olmsted reserved areas as wildlife sanctuaries.
" I he result is a place where anvone can get
(lose to nature," Kennedy wrote in the March
edition of Stanford Magazine.
Bird-watching is one of the fastest grow
ing hobbies iu America. More than f> million
enthusiasts now buy "birding" gear (binocu
lars. field guides, even special software to
record observation). Indeed, many ama
teurs have developed as much expertise .is
trained ornithologists, which has helped re
search in conservation biology.
Fhrlich, who co-authored the "Birder's
Handbook" iu the 19605, has been teaching
.111 undergraduate course on the Biology <>112
Birds since I he I 980s.
I le urges students to "take up bird-watching
to get great enjoyment and learn how to make
.11 cms of human disturbance, like the campus,
more hospitable to birds."
"All vou need is a bird guide and a pair of
binoculars to enjov a wonderful outdoor

hobby, a $100 investment," Fhrlich said.
In response to increased interest in birds,
enthusiasts helped design a fledgling Web site
devoted to Stanford's birds. It provides such
resources as campus maps, habitat descriptions
and bird checklists for various destinations.
Separate pages for 125 birds list individual
characteristics along with drawings by profes
sional artists.
Besides providing aesthetic pleasure, birds
serve important functions in nature, according
to Biological Sciences Prof. Peter Ray. " 1 hey
have an ecological function of pollination and
seed dispersal, thus intimately related to plan
reproduction," Ray said.
"I also appreciate their contribution toward
aesthetics, which definitely affects the way you
feel about things," he continued.
Grey said the campus "is a fine place for
birds . . . [and] some reasonable things can be
done to keep it that way."
He said that future "plans for building
should take account of bird habitats to pre
serve natural pockets on campus," citing the
French Meadow, where new houses are being
built, as an example that did not respect this.
"The Grounds Department should be as tol
erant as they can, subject to Fire control con
siderations. of underbrush and dead trees on
campus, rather than succumbing to the im
pulse to neaten everything up. These provide
valuable bird habitats," (irey said.
Grey also mentioned the problem of feral cats
that eat birds, propsing to limit their population
growth to ensure healthv bird populations.
For students, even with their hectic sched
ules, bird-watching can be done in the most
unexpected ways.
Senior Aniit Chadha, a self-declared
bird-enthusiast, s.iid, "One of the reasons I
like to studv outside is to watch the birds.
They are amazing."
"Whenever I run near the Dish, I see that
red-throat blackbirds and hummingbirds are
in the oak trees all around. Occasionally, 1
have even seen eagles and hawks, which is
pretty cool. The birds are one of the best things
about the Stanford campus." Chandra said.
Sophomore Christina Chou agreed. "I am
not such a big bird fan, but 1 like the blue
jays. Birds contribute to a nice atmosphere."
