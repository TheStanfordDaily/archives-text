## Checkerboards not just for the nerds anymore 
### STEPHANIE CHIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Q: My friend told me
about this hrainteaser he just
saw. It consists oj a regular
H-by-8-inch checkerboard
and 32 regular (that is, 2-
by-l-inch) dominoes. You
can fit all the dominoes onto
the board because the
checkerboard lias 64
squares, as do the dominoes
added together.
He claims that, if you cut
away opposing comers of the
checkerboard and take away
one domino, there's no way
\ou can fit all the dominoes
that are left fully on the
board. I'hat is, he flunks that
there will always be two half
dominoes — one half for each
of the tiro dominoes — hang
ing off the board. Is this true?
I J so, why?
A: Yes, your friend is
right. In Figure A, you can
clearly see that M2 2-by-l
inch dominoes will com
pletely till up the 8-by-8-
inch checkerboard. 1 n
Figure C, you will see the
checkerboard with 11 it* op
posing edges cut off. At
first, it seems like the 31
dominoes will be able to
completely lit in the al
tered board — in which
there are (>'J squares — in
.i snake-like pattern (plat
ing dominoes from the top
row right to left, then
down the next row left to
right and so on).
Despite the many pos
sible ways to arrange the
dominoes on the board,
there will always be two
ha If-dominoes hanging
off the board. How can I
prove this? Well, if you
look at a regular checker

board, black squares al
ternate with white
squares so that each black
square is surrounded bv
white squares on .ill sides.
So, let's look at the unal
tered checkerboard's bot
tom-most row and the
right-most column in Fig
ure A, which form a re
verse-!, shape. We focus
on them because they are
the sides that will have
squares cut out in the al
tered board (Figure li)-
Let's go through this
carefully: Starting at the
left bottom comer and
going to the right in Fig
ure A, it's white, black, w,
b, w, b. w, b (which begins
the column up), w, b, w, b,
w, b, w. If you cut away
the two opposing edges of
the reverse-L shape that
we have highlighted (Fig
ure B), you are cutting
away the left-most white
square on the bottom row
and the top-most white
square on the column.
Thus, two white squares
are cut away.
However, if von look at
how dominoes are put on
the board, you will see that
tliev always take up one
black square and one
white square. That's the
key to the answer. We've
cut away two white squares
instead of one white and
one black square. So
there's no way that you can
fit all the dominoes on a
board that has its opposing
edges cut off.
