# For-profit administration of domain names threatens Net
## 
### JEFF WU 
li\ the end of this month, the U.S. De
partment <>! Commerce will announce
whether n will approve two contracts that
will li.iihl over the administration of the
new .hi/ and .info Internet domain
names. I nder the < ontracts, the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, .1 not-for-profit organization
ih.it administers the Internet address sys
tem, will he forced to cede authority to
administer the domain names to two for
profit corporations.
K .ANN has heen compared to a "gov
ernment" foi tlu- Internet and derives its
power to regulate the Internet through
its control of the Internet naming system.
On the Internet, after all, if you aren't a
part of the address system, Web surfers
011 other networks can't find you, and
you effc< tivelv don't exist.
In December, I ('.ANN approved the
<uation of seven new domain names:
.info and .hi/, due to be handed over by
the end of Ma\. along with .pro (for pro
fessionals stub as lawyers and accoun
tants), .name (individuals), .aero (aero
spat e industt \). .coop (cooperatives) and
.museum.
The .info and .hi/ domain names
could be available to the public by this
fall; negotiations continue 011 the terms of
the contracts for the other five names.
When ICANN announced the cre
ation of these domain names, the first
since the original seven» — .com, .org,
.gov, .net. .edu, .mil and .arpa - were laid
out more than 10 years ago, critics, in
cluding consumer groups and some 40
companies who applied to administer
other domain names, blamed ICANN for
setting up a rushed, arbitrary, greedy

process that moved too slowly in expand
ing the domain name system.
ICANN had forced the 47 applicants
for domain names to pay a nonrefund
able $50,000. Critics charged that

ICANN's criteria for selecting do
main names and their administrators
did not allow for sufficient input and
was difficult to understand.
And some people wondered why
ICANN was moving so slowly in ap
proving new domains, such as .xxx
(for adult content sites), .kids, .travel
or .geo (for geographical sites). Why
not allow the creation of a multitude
of names? After all. some people be
lieve, the existing address system is
too crowded. Almost 29 million do
main names have been registered, in
cluding 22 million .com names alone.
But cyberspace, a world in which the
rules can be changed simply by writ
ing new code, has a funny way of try
ing to "route around" a problem.
ICANN is getting competition.

A Pasadena-based company called
New.net announced last month that it
was offering new domains — including
.sport, ,inp3 and law — that would oper
ate exactly like existing ones. New.net is
able to pull this oil without approval from
ICANN bv simply adding these domains
to its own domain name servers.
Domain name servers are the ma
chines that tell your browser where to go
when you type in the address of .1 specif
ic Web site. If you type in
"http://stlr.stanford.edu," for example,
your browser will ask your Internet Ser
vice Provider's domain name server
where to go to get the home page for the
Stanford Technology Law Review. Your
ISP's domain name server will go to a

more centralized domain name server,
which will direct it to another central
server that keeps track of the .edn (lo
in.tin. This central server checks its data-

base .ind sends the specific Internet Pro
tocol address for stir.Stanford.edn to
your browser.
New.net simply needs you to check its
root server, instead of ICANN's, in order
to direct you to its own domain names.
This will only prove effective, however, if
New.net can convince a large number of
domain name servers to check its own
root servers. To this end, New.net has
struck deals with several large ISPs, in
cluding At Home. And individual surfers
(an program their browsers to check
New.net's servers by downloading a
browser plug-in. Like Federal Express
and United Parcel Service pushing the
U.S. Postal Service to offer quicker, more

reliable service, New.net might eventual
ly prove to be a credible competitor to
ICANN, pressuring it to expand the
number of domain names.
It's not entirely clear that this new
competition is a good tiling, however.
Certainly, few would complain about
the sort of competition FedKxand DPS
provide the U.S. Postal Service, lint
what about the competition provided,
say, public schools by private schools
through a voucher system? Certainly,
many believe that this competition
takes money out of the public school
system, (reams ofl the best students
and hurts the overall education system.
How can we assess the value of the
competition provided by companies
like New.net, which will push ICANN
to provide more domain names, per
haps at a faster rate than it would have
otherwise?
On the positive side, new domain
names may allow more descriptive
categorizations. A .xxx domain
name for adult content sites, for ex
ample, is more easily identified (and
either filtered or searched, depend
ing upon your predilection). An in
creased supply of domain names
might also bring down domain name
registration prices.
hut, on the other hand, new names
create confusion. Was that Web site a
.com or a .biz? In addition, trademarks
may be diluted. Amazon.com would not
likely be terribly happy to have someone
take up the domain name ama/on.biz, foi
example. To avoid this, trademark hold
ers might simply buy their trademark
equivalents in all of the possible domain
names, which would surely be wasteful
duplication.

And wli.it il unoffic i.il domain names
overlap with oflic i.il ones? I hen multiple
parallel address s\ stems could arise, caus
ing serious problems for Internet surfers
and Web sites. I lie Atlantic Root Net
work has sold ;>,.">()() .I)i/ domain names,
for example, I >ill now finds tli.it this alter
native domain name s\ stem is about to be
overrun b\ the new IC.ANN names.
I lie i eal signifi< .nice of this < omnier
(i.il < ompetitioii could go far beyond
tradeni.u k dilution. As long as the popu
lation of sin fers connecting to New.net's
servers is significant but relatively small
compared to the overall Net population,
New.net will exert a significant but small
amount of pressure on l( \NN.
Hut imagine if it were not New .net im
plementing this scheme, but rather
America Online oi Miciosolt. Microsoft
could simplv allei fcvploiet todieck Mi
crosoft's domain name servers. Microsoft
could indeed virt uall\ lake control of the
global domain nunc s\steni, subject to
control onl) from Intel net 1101 ins, sham
ing or govet omental action.
Whethei the competition is good or
bad for the s\stem. undei the Net's de
tent rali/ed structure, il appears in
evitable. ICANN has no choice but to
realize that its actions are constrained
b\ the market and b\ significant lntei
net actors. IC.ANN' needs to recognize
this strategic threat and open up its do
main naming process, fostering a con
trolled. bin rapid, expansion <>1 top
level domains. I( ANN needs to admin
istei domain names in a manner that
preserves public control, in order to
ensure the Internet remains the
provinc eof all.
