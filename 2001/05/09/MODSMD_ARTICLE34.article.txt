## From walk-on to team leader: O'Riordan mounts attack 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Junior Chris O'Riordan always gets
tired up lor a game.
In this particular instance, though, lie
admits lie's tried to tone down his com
petitiveness.
"People might say 'big deal, it's only a
video game,'" (VRiordan said.
Only a videogame? Hardly.
This is Mario Kart, where anything
goes.
"We've got a big rivalry — it gets
bloody sometimes. It's intense and
tierce," he s.iid of the seriousness of Ins
Nintendo 64 battles with his drawmates
and baseball teammates, Jason YanMee
tren,J.l). Wilcox, Pablo Bravo and Scott
I )ragicevich.
"I just don't like to lose. I like to suc
ceed," he said.
It's not just his philosophy for Mario
Kart.
That ambitious and oftentimes cut
throat attitude O'Riordan displays in
front of his 20-inch television screen is the
same spirit that has helped him become
an unlikely starting second baseman on a
national collegiate powerhouse.
"I guess I always feel like 1 have some
thing to prove," (VRiordan said.
For the 5-loot-9, 175-pound athlete,
proving himself to others has become
common practice, whether he has a video
game controller or a glove in his hand.
1 le admits that his si/c- has kept him at
a disadvantage — in other people's
minds, .it least.
"People have always been like. He's
reallv small. 1 don't know if he can do this
or that.' " O'Riordan said. "But I always
knew I could play at any level with any
one, so it reallv didn't matter."

Hence his determination to make
the Stanford squad as a walk-on, de
spite the comments of head coach Mark
Marquess.
" 1 ie came in and 1 basically tried to talk
him out of it, but he wouldn't be discour
aged," Marquess said.
As a tour-year member on The Bish
op's School baseball team in San Diego,
(VRiordan had proven himself worthy ot
playing fora couple ot Ivy League
schools, including Penn and Dartmouth.
Not making the Area (lode team, though
— a chance tor players to show them
selves oft to college scouts — hurt his
chance of being recruited by a top-notch
team.
However, when assistant coach Dean
Stot/ took a look .it one ot (VRiordan's
tapes, the coaching staff decided to give
liini a rare shot at a walk-on tryout.
No scholarship, no intense recruiting
out of high school. Just a chance to play
tor one of the nation's top programs.
And even when O'Riordan got that
chance, it wasn't dear sailing. Not only
was he a walk-on, but he also had to show
that he could keep up with his talented
teammates, especially the other recruits.
"The frustration was to be expected
because the other players were more
heavily recruited," O'Riordan said. "The
onlv frustrating part was that I knew that
I could play to that level, but 1 complete
ly understood that I would have to work
harder to prove myself to them."
O'Riordan did work harder, and the
other players noticed.
"You could tell from the first clay that
he was a go-getter," Dragicevich said.
"He's just one of those guvs who always
puts the extra time in."
So, after an entire year of devoting his
time to practice with the team, sitting out

conference and playoff games, because ot
the limited roster ot 25 players, O'Rior
dan got his chance as a sophomore.
O'Riordan struggled at lit si, going 0-
tbr-12 to start the yeai, bm Marquess
stuck with him because he had been hit
ting the ball hard.
What a good decision.
On Feb. 12, 2000, the undersized
walk-on got his first collegiate hit, a home
run to left field in the bottom ol (Ik- 10th
inning that capped an 8-0 victory over
Florida State.
He then emerged as the starting sec
ond baseman for the next 57 games, win
ning the job ovei Dragicevich and now
third baseman junior Andy lopham.
Even more, he led the team with a .300
batting average.
"I was glad that 1 was able to pro
duce when 1 finally got the shot," O'Ri
ordan said.
The political science major doesn't just
produce anymore. As a junior, he is a
team leader who leads by example.
This year, O'Riordan heads the team
in at-bats, hits (70). RBI (55) and stolen
bases (15).
Oh, yeah, there's one more: home
runs (9).
Home runs are "really not my game,
but the hardest you can hit it is a home
run, and that's my goal: to hit it as hard as
1 can every time," (VRiordan said.
No longer is O'Riordan "that little
guy" who followed power hitters )oe Bor
chard, Edmund Muth and John (..ill in
the 2000 College World Series. Now, he is
that leadoft or second batter in the lineup
who can either take it deep or merely gel
on base.
And. this time around, it is O'Riordan

In this particular instance, though, lie

"People might say 'big deal, it's only a

Only a videogame? Hardly.
This is Mario Kart, where anything
goes.

"I just don't like to lose. I like to suc

It's not just his philosophy for Mario
Kart.
That ambitious and oftentimes cut
throat attitude O'Riordan displays in
front of his 20-inch television screen is the
same spirit that has helped him become
an unlikely starting second baseman on a
national collegiate powerhouse.
"I guess I always feel like 1 have some
thing to prove," (VRiordan said.
For the 5-loot-9, 175-pound athlete,
proving himself to others has become
common practice, whether he has a video
game controller or a glove in his hand.
1 le admits that his si/c- has kept him at
a disadvantage — in other people's
minds, .it least.
"People have always been like. He's
reallv small. 1 don't know if he can do this
or that.' " O'Riordan said. "But I always
knew I could play at any level with any
one, so it reallv didn't matter."

Hence his determination to make
the Stanford squad as a walk-on, de
spite the comments of head coach Mark
Marquess.
" 1 ie came in and 1 basically tried to talk
him out of it, but he wouldn't be discour
aged," Marquess said.
As a tour-year member on The Bish
op's School baseball team in San Diego,
(VRiordan had proven himself worthy ot
playing fora couple ot Ivy League
schools, including Penn and Dartmouth.
Not making the Area (lode team, though
— a chance tor players to show them
selves oft to college scouts — hurt his
chance of being recruited by a top-notch
team.
However, when assistant coach Dean
Stot/ took a look .it one ot (VRiordan's
tapes, the coaching staff decided to give
liini a rare shot at a walk-on tryout.
No scholarship, no intense recruiting
out of high school. Just a chance to play
tor one of the nation's top programs.
And even when O'Riordan got that
chance, it wasn't dear sailing. Not only
was he a walk-on, but he also had to show
that he could keep up with his talented
teammates, especially the other recruits.
"The frustration was to be expected
because the other players were more
heavily recruited," O'Riordan said. "The
onlv frustrating part was that I knew that
I could play to that level, but 1 complete
ly understood that I would have to work
harder to prove myself to them."
O'Riordan did work harder, and the
other players noticed.
"You could tell from the first clay that
he was a go-getter," Dragicevich said.
"He's just one of those guvs who always
puts the extra time in."
So, after an entire year of devoting his
time to practice with the team, sitting out

conference and playoff games, because ot
the limited roster ot 25 players, O'Rior
dan got his chance as a sophomore.
O'Riordan struggled at lit si, going 0-
tbr-12 to start the yeai, bm Marquess
stuck with him because he had been hit
ting the ball hard.
What a good decision.
On Feb. 12, 2000, the undersized
walk-on got his first collegiate hit, a home
run to left field in the bottom ol (Ik- 10th
inning that capped an 8-0 victory over
Florida State.
He then emerged as the starting sec
ond baseman for the next 57 games, win
ning the job ovei Dragicevich and now
third baseman junior Andy lopham.
Even more, he led the team with a .300
batting average.
"I was glad that 1 was able to pro
duce when 1 finally got the shot," O'Ri
ordan said.
The political science major doesn't just
produce anymore. As a junior, he is a
team leader who leads by example.
This year, O'Riordan heads the team
in at-bats, hits (70). RBI (55) and stolen
bases (15).
Oh, yeah, there's one more: home
runs (9).
Home runs are "really not my game,
but the hardest you can hit it is a home
run, and that's my goal: to hit it as hard as
1 can every time," (VRiordan said.
No longer is O'Riordan "that little
