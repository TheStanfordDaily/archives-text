# Postseason starts for golf

### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
In honor of last week's 127 th
running of the Kentucky Derby,
one could call the NCAA West
Kegionals the second leg ot
women's collegiate golfs " I riple

(Irown."
1 lie No. 1 Cardinal took sec
ond place in the first leg — the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in lenipe, Ariz., two
weeks ago — falling three strokes
short of No. 2 Arizona.
Now, what the team needs to

do this week on the 6,089-yard,
pat-72 Trysting Tree Golf
Course in Corvallis, Ore., is to
place eighth or better. II the
squad is successful, it will secure
itself a spot in the final leg of this
Triple Crown — not Belmont,
hut the NCAA Championships,
which will be played on I fowie in
the Hills, Fla., from May 22 to
May 25.
It doesn't seem like a very
tough task for Stanford this
week, considering it has placed in
the top l()in its last 31 events, but
senior Stephanie keever was
somewhat cautious in her ap
proach to the tournament.
"It's never a given, and never
safe to say that we'll automatical
ly qualify this week," she said.
"But if we play our game, we
should make it."
Eight of the 21 teams in the
field are ranked in the top 25 in
the nation, including Arizona, No.
3 Southern California, and No. 7
Tennessee. The West Regional is
one of three regionals being
played this week to determine the
24-team field for NCAAs.
What comes into question at
any regional is the importance of
a high finish because a team does
not get an advantage at NCAAs if
it places high at a regional. Last
year the Cardinal placed sixth, a
fairly low position, before playing
excellent golf in the NCAA Tour
nament to capture the runner
up spot.
Keever, however, wants the
Cardinal's play this year at re
gionals to be a little bit more
competitive.
"We definitely want to make a
statement, and, after our show
ing in Fac-l()s, we're ready to
show that we're one of the best
teams in the country," she said.

Stanford has had a bit of a rest
