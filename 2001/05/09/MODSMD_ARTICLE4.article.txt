### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he Santa (llara (!ount\ Board ot Supervisors yes
terday expressed its intent to certify' the Carnegie
I'oundation's architectural plans and Fnvironmental
Impact Report, opening the door for the think
tank's long awaited move to .1 new facility in
the St an ford foot hills.
I he hoard s approval came with one major stipula
tion: that all roads and parking spat es he brought en
tirely within the limits of the academic growth bound
ary established by the University's new General
Use Permit.
The dec isiou brought an end to months of wran
gling over the foundation's proposal to construct a
21 ,()()()-s(|uare-fbot cluster of buildings on Stanford
land just west ot Junipero Sen a lilvd. The controver
sy began in November, when the Santa (Mara Gounty
Planning Commission initially voted to approve
the foundation's plans and issue a use permit
for the project.
The Gommittee for Green Foothills appealed the
dec ision on the grounds that tlu- proposal violated the
I mversity's pledge to refrain from building in the
112 oothills for 25 years. I he Board of Supervisors first
heard the appeal on Marc h 20, when Supervisor Li/
Rniss ordered the foundation to modify its plans or
look elsewhere.
At yesterday's hearing, the board voted !t-2 to deny
the Foothill committee's appeal.
1 he political battle over the siting of Carnegie is
over," said l*irry Horton, Stanford's directoi of gov
ernment and community relations. " I lie result was es
sentially approval."
Assuming it finds a way to meet the requirements
the board outlined yesterday, the Carnegie Founda
tion for the Advancement of I 'caching will become the
newest non-profit research organization on campus
lands. It will move in near to the Center for Advanced
