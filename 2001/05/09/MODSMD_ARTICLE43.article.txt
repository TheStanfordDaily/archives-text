Senior Katherine Barnes (above), sophomore Liz Lanese (top left) and freshman Noor Dawood (bottom left)
compete for Stanford in a 9-8 victory over St. Mary's earlier this year. The three helped lead the Cardinal to its
fourth consecutive Western Women's Lacrosse League Championship this year. Dawood scored four goals in
Stanford's 1 1 -6 victory over California in the championship game. The Cardinal ended the season 1 4-5 overall
and 9-0 in the WWLL.
