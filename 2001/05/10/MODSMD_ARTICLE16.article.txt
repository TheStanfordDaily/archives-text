## The
						Stanford Daily Harvard sit-in offers a lesson for all students 
### 
Published Since IS9I

CONCI.I DINC. 21 DAYS ola dramatic sit-in,
Harvard students negotiated with their ad
ministration last week, but could not agree
u|)on a living wage of $10.25 for all I larvard
employees. Hie administration was only willing to cre
ate a diverse living wage committee ol (acuity, workers
,ind students to (list uss possible solutions, hut their cam
paign is .in inspiration lor students across the nation.
We, as students, t an leat ti a great deal from the I larvard
< ampaign, particularly in terms <>l the accountability ol
students to the communities that surround them.
From the perspective ol student ac tivism, it isgener
all\ niiK li easier lor students to rally around their own
needs and demands, and, oftentimes, this is the type ol
student activism that is most successful. When students
are the direct constituencies ola campaign, campus sup
port seems to galvanize quicker and solutions seem
more favorable. Hie recent c ampaign on campus to in
crease community center funding is an example ola
suc c essful campaign i un by students, lor students. I Ins
is because the relationship ol accountabilih between the
I niversilN and students is clear'and direct.

What seems more diliicult, though, at least in terms ol
the I larvard living wage c ampaign, is for students to run
campaigns that emphasize the accountability ol universi
ties to groups who are seen — .it least by the administra
tion— as "outside" ol the immediate university commu
nity. Students at Harvard were lighting to get a living
wage lor contrac ted lal>orers and to make the I niversity
ac countable to workers it does not directly hire.
When students try to speak up for those whom the
university refuses to feel accountable to, the situation
gels a bit more diliicult, and a victory in such a campaign
is often times harder to gain.
At Stanford, students seem to be reluctant to work in
a visible w.i\ with community members on the issues
that lace those inembei spree iselvlieeauseit issodiflic ult
to do. Students will rall\ around department ineigers
andcoinmunitN center lunding, which are im|>ortant is
sues to light lor, but it seems particularly diliicult to get
Stanford students interested in issues that are lacing the
surrounding communities. Max be it is because students
leel 100 distant Iroin the needs ol the immediate student
community or think it will be too diliicult to make the

I niversity care. Whatever the case, besides a few cam
paigns like the dioxin campaign by Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford, students seem hugely un
interested in working with the local community to help
bring their issues to the administration.
While it might be true that such advocacy cam
paigns are dif lie ult and not always successlul in terms ol
the campaign demands, these types of campaigns are
absolutely essential to connecting campus communi
ties to local and national communities. Even though
the outcome of the I larvard campaign was not ideal,
the cohesion Ix'tween students and "outside ' commu
nities provides a model that Stanford students am and
should follow.
The I larvard living wage campaign can alsoteac h us
th, it, as members of a university community, students
are also res|x)nsible for the ac tions of then administra
tion. If an administration is supporting sulxonti actors
that pay workers $6.50 and students do not protest with
workers against such low wages, then their silence
makes them responsible lor the injustice as well.
l lius, it is essential that students work as allies and

advocates for communities that their administration
consistentJv neglects. I lie Harvard living wage sit-in
made dear the ini|x>rtance of students to acknowl
edge their accountability to marginalized communi
ties through political action. As 1 larvard argued dur
ing the campaign. "Workers Can't hat lYestige, and ii
is the responsibility of students to keep the actions of
their administration in check, especially when those
iiflec tedare not recognized members of the university
community.
1 his tvpe of campaign, in which students and local
communitv members work together to increase univer
sity accountability, is desperately needed at Stanford.
I he claim that the administration is only accountable to
inemlxTs ofthe university community is fallacious; Stan
ford does not run independent of the community sur
rounding it. Stanford students need to realize that, its
members of the I' uiversity, they too are accountable for
theeflect of their university on out side communities. We
support the efforts of campus ac tivists in recent years,
and we hope students will use the lessons from the 1 lar
vard campaign to jump into more activism on campus.
