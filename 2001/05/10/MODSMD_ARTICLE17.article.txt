## Learning about PoMo 
### 
Post inodci nism, alfee tionately
known by in.my .is PoMo, has
lately been indue straits. I his is
surprising, tor PoMo has much
to rt'(ommend ii. PoMo rejects objective
1111111 m lavor of subjective understand
ings of the world.
Its goals are laudable: the rejection of
totalizing grand narratives in favor of lo
< alized narratives that allow for individual
expression. As political expression, it has
allowed peoples who were previouslv sub-

jugated undei the totaliz- r
ing ( ulture ol I In* imperi
al West to gain their own
voice. litink Fdward

ment; this allows us to in
dulge our cheesiest

With all these advantages, why is I'oMo
suffering ridieule in the academe these
davs? Itccausc us exponents have fallen
into using the most opaque, impenetrable,
and vague prose stvle.
I saw Duke University's Frederic: Jame
son lecture at Stanford four years ago.

"modernism," "modernity" and "mod

tirely incomprehensible. At question time,
no hands were raised — because every
one in the room, professors and students
alike, had fallen asleep. The few who were
awake had almost finished the crossword
pu/./le in I lie Daily.
I soon discovered that I was not alone
in my frustration. Postmodernists do in
deed use the most idiotic language. I Ins
led to a celebrated academic hoax. In
1001, Alan Sokal, a physic ist at New York
I Diversity, published .in article in Social
lext, purportedly about the postmodern
implications of theories in physics. Sokal
himself revealed later that his essay was
merely full of jargon, non-sequiturs and
patently lalse (laims, veiled behind mean
ingless phrases such as "a lilnratorv math

analysis because nobody could under
stand his writing.
The ridiculousness of postmodern
prose has ,m quired something of a cult sta

('ritic s of I'oMo s prose st\le have gen
erally gone on to reject I'oMo itself, but
this would be a mistake. I'oMo does oiler
valuable insights; it just needs an image
overhaul. I'oMo writers need a new writ
ing st vie.
I he snag is that a cleai and succinct
prose won't do anv good. I heodor
Aclorno, one ol I'oMo's intellet tual godfa
thers, argued that one could not think
radical thoughts in conventional lan
guage. I'oMo is about esc aping from tradi
tional ( ultin al forms and recogni/ing new
ones. It cannot use the language of the op
pressors to liberate the oppressed. It must
use a specialized and technical jargon.

and opacity in the first plat e. ()ui new so
lution must recognize I'oMo's need for a
vocabulary that would take years of grad

I he answer is game theory.
I propose that I'oMo abandon si it h
phrases as "post-Fordist ineta-nai ratives"
and instead embrace the mathematical
theory of games. This is not .is preposter

(..line theory offers a radical new way
to interpret literature. For instance, stu
dents of F.nglish 165: "Arthurian Litera
ture" read the medieval poem, "Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight." Sir
('.twain accepts a challenge from a knight
who will most likely kill him a year hence.
Most critical analyses of the poem talk
about the symbolism, heraldry, rituals
and other peripheral things. I hey miss
the essential point of the story: Why does
Gawain accept the Green Knight's chal
lenge in the first place? Stanford profes
sor Barry (VNeill otters a game theoretic
answer: Gawain has certain specific in
centives to uphold the norm of accepting
challenges.
Game theory can analyze literature
across genres, offering new insights into
the strategic problems that fictional c har
acters face. It is a difficult and technical
language, full of jargon such as "Nash
equilibrium," and "trembling hand per
fection." So game theory satisfies Adorno's
criteria — it can function as a vehicle for

Game theory can analyze literature
across genres, offering new insights into
the strategic problems that fictional c har
acters face. It is a difficult and technical
language, full of jargon such as "Nash
equilibrium," and "trembling hand per
fection." So game theory satisfies Adorno's
criteria — it can function as a vehicle for
