Senior lauds instruction, value
of American Studies program
1 .1111 writing to express my shock and
displeasure .it the Fai ultv Senate's renew
al of the American Studies program for
onh three vears instead of the normal five.
I he decision disregarded a recommenda
tion from the (Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies that the program should be re
newed for five years. Members of the Fac
ult\ Senate had three major concerns: the
number of students in American studies,
an idea that tin- major larks focus and .1
feat that there are not enough faculty
committed to the program. Though the
Faculty Senate's intentions are good, these
criticisms demonstrate a lack of research
and understanding about the American
Studies program.
When Comparative Studies in Race and
Kthnicity became .1 major, American Stud
ies student enrollment numbers waned
slightly. This was natural and expected be
cause, up to that point, American studies
provided an outlet for students whose pri
mary focus was race. But in the years since,
the American Studies program has been
growing again. It currently boasts B.S ma
jors— twice as many as philosophy, c las
sics, religious studies or drama — and
nearly as many as communication and po
litic. il sc ienc e. Prof . Russell Herman's state
ment that they "could not ignore the de
cline" exaggerated a small, temporary clip
and disregarded the reasons for it, as well
as the comparative strength of the overall
numbers in the major.
Secondly, the American studies major

lacks neither intellectual focus nor aca
demic rigor. There are five required
courses, one of wliic h is a seminar — and
.111 additional seminar requirement.
American studies majors have to fill
breadth requirements in tour separate
areas of American studies: Visual and
Material Culture, History and Society,
Politics, Policy and Fconcunics and Liter
ature and Thought — one of which they
must declat c as a primary focus, complet
ing five 01 more courses in il. Finally,
there is a multiple-course race and eth
nicity requirement.
The focus and requirements c reate a
comprehensive understanding of the field
of American studies as a whole. I he major
is not a mere "mish mash." but a disc rete
field of study. I « hallcngc anyone who as
serts otherwise to sit in on the required
courses for the major. American studies is
no more of a cobbled-together conglom
eration than human biology, symbolic sys
tems, Asian-American studies or French
and Italian. Its interdisciplinary quality is
integral to its coherence as a program.
It approaches America the way Ger
man studies approaches Germany —
seeking to understand a people and their
country through history, language, litera
ture, politics and art rather than one sin
gle, narrow lens.
Finally, perhaps the most paradoxical
criticism by the Faculty Senate was that the
American Studies Program has an insuffi
cient number of tenure-track fac ultv com
mitted to it. I fere, it is important to distin
guish between "teaching" and "commit
ment." Certainly, there are dozens of

tenured I.unity from other departments
who teach in American studies. The Fac
ultv Senate's concern is that some of the
main American studies positions are held
In individuals who are phenomenal teach
ers hut are "senior lecturers" rather than
tenure-track faculty. I his may be true, es
pecially with a few looming retirements,
hut Stanford has tlie power to remedy this.
I lie University refuses to make faculty ap
pointments in "programs," only hiring
"senior lecturers" in American studies.
I lius, any faculty interested in commit
ting to American studies take the program
on as ,i secondary commitment, which
would mean time away from their prima
ry department with no occupational in
centive—cspecially for junior faculty who
are encouraged to fix us on getting tenure
in their departments.
It is not as though American studies is
an obscure field; Yale University and
New York University have full-fledged
American studies departments, complete
with graduate students and hefty faculty
r< >sters.
1 112 Stanford doesn't take American stud
ies seriously, what incentive would top
Americanists have to choose Stanford over
Yale or NYU? The answer lies not in
threatening or "challenging" American
studies to change, but in giving it more
support so that it will have the ability to at
tract and keep faculty the same way de
partments can.
On a personal level, American studies
has been crucial in shaping my time at
Stanford. It has provided me intellectual
tcnus and a dynamic, intelligent academic
community — .is it has tot hundreds ol
other Stanford undergraduates who have
moved on to leadership roles in business,
law, education and academia. 1 hope that,
in the next three years, the I niversit\ will
research and reflect upon the positive im
pact American studies has had at Stan
ford— and that the program will be
granted the support and respei tit so rich
ly deserves.

SSE clarifies purpose of
Business Leadership program
The central mission of the Business
Leadership Program is educational. First
.tnd foremost, the program is designed to
fuel the business interests of its partici
pants In facilitating dose interaction be
tween students and professors. I lie (irad
uate School of Business, and, in particu
lar, Professor (ieorge Parker, has been ex
ceptional!) supportive of this mission.
Stanford Student Knterprises enlisted the
help of the (iSB spec ificalb because the
program is at its core an educational ex
perience. Perhaps even more important
ly, spending four clays with (><> other
young business leaders will be invaluable
for participants.
While the recruiting aspect of the pro
gram is also essential, let me emphasi/c
that it is subordinate to the overriding ed
ucational purpose. Investment banks and
consulting firms will surelv be among the
sponsors, but the Business Leadership
Program would tail iniserablv it it neglec t
ed sponsors from other sectors. Lo that

end, SSL is making a concerted effort to
lure sponsors from industries besides
those which have had a historical recruit
ing presence at Stanford.
Put simplv, the Business Leadership
Program aims to expose students to an
arra\ of educational and career opportu
nities in a unique, integrated setting. SSl
is thrilled to inaugurate such a tremen
dous event, and I encourage students who
share this enthusiasm to apply.

'Stuffing' option not feasible
for graauate housing
As a doctoral student who lost in the
graduate housing lotterv, I believe that
stuffed housing is not a good solution,
even f<>r the short term.
(•raduatc students, hv losing in the
lotterv, have to move off campus, put
chase a car and so on. I got kicked otf
loin vears ago (back before the graduate
housing rall\ motivated the I niversit\ to
c reate the subsidized housing program).
T he following year, I was ineligible ten
subsidized housing because I did not
want to live in stuffed housing in
(aothers Memorial.
As a ps\< liologv graduate student, I was
paid the minimum stipend — the lowest
amount that the I nivcrsit\ pays a gradu
ate student — and was vcrv vulnerable to
the housing market. (It can be ven diffi
cult toget a place unless vou are living with
a non-student who lias a full-time job, so
that vou are less of a financial risk to a land
lorcl). W illi thai said, 1 leel that stuffing is
not reallv a viable option for inosi gradu
ate students, given our current stage of
lite. As a 27-vear-olcl doctoral» anclidate, 1
realb am past ilie point ol sliai nig a dorm
room; I did that as .111 undergraduate, but
I'm in a \er\ different siauc of lite now.

Slutting is not a feasible option for the ma
jority of graduate students.
The slutting option would also detract
fromStanford's abilit\ to attract lotsol top,
prospective graduate students who can
( Iloose between Harvard, Princeton, the
University ol Pennsylvania—places
where they can live in decent apartments
and have stipends ili.it allow tor a better
quality of life — and Stanford.
Ultimately, while it wasn't easy, I used
mv research skills to find a place, and each
time thex had much more space than 011-
campus housing. While it cost more and it
was difficult and time consuming to find
affordable housing, I would never trade it
lor stuffed housing on campus. 1 he few
(ver\ frustrating) weeks ol searching for
detent, affordable housing was still much
better than spending an entire year in
stuffed < onditions.

Klinksiek's letter 'misguided'
I lie suggest i<ni (in Brian Klinksiek's Mav

9 letter, "University 'needs to examine the
relative worth ot its graduate students' )
that an engineering master's student
may be worth less to the I niversity than
a humanities doctoral student, and that
this be considered as a basis lor deter
mining priority tot on-iampus housing,
is ridiculous. 1 think many people would
'agree that they are tired <>l hearing
opinions that engineering, technical,
business and other pre-professional ed
ucation and careers are less intellectual
.uicl less valuable to the intellectual (0111-
munitv. I tigli pay does not imply low in
tellectual value, and low pay does not
imply high intellectual value. Is it too
difficult to imagine that people are
drawn to engineering disc iplincs tot the
intellectual value rather than the high
pay? It is a double standard for engi
neering students to be expec ted to rec
ognize the value of humanities educa
tion while people feel it is acceptable to
denounce the value of engineering and
the people who work in engineering.
The perception that humanities
doctoral students are less able to af
ford housing than engineering mas
ter's students — the two groups in
Klinksiek's letter — is also misguided.
While an engineering master's student
may earn mote than a humanities dcx -
toral student after graduation, there is
no wav that basing housing priorities
on proje( ted future earnings could be
fair. Some engineering students de
cide to pursue low-paving jobs in
teaching, government or non-profit
organizations, and some humanities
graduate students decide to pursue
high-paving jobs in c onsulting 01 man
agement positions in business. I bete
is no wav to predict the true future fi
nancial situation of any student. I bus,
any priority scheme based 011 financial
situation must be based on the c 111 rem
financial situation, not (lie future.
Contrary to some people's opin
ions, I would argue that engineering

graduate students art* no better off fi
nancially, it not worse off, than hu
manities graduate students while in
school. In fait, there is evidence for
the latter. Engineering master's stu
dents are rarelv offered financial assis
tant e, while humanities doctoral stu
dents are almost always offered assis
tantships, it not fellowships. A two
\eat engineering mastei's ptogram
(an quit kl \ put a student m $(>O,OOO ot
additional debt.
In addition, even .1 ">0 pert cut assis
tantship has a financial value with the
stipend .ind tuition approximately
equal to $10,000, which is mm li more
than most engineering students with
out assist.tntships can even 111.ike in
high-paving programming jobs while
111 school.
Most engineering master's students
enter directlv from undergraduate
programs and have 110 more prior
earnings and savings than a humani
ties student might have. Also, engi
neering master's students come dis
proportionately from developing
countries like India and China where
the per capita income is on the order
of one-tenth that of the I nited States,
and their savings would hardly make a
contribution toward their current cost
of living and education, 112 uture earn
ings. however high, have absolutely no
bearing 011 whether students can af
ford housing now.
Below-market rent is also not the
sole purpose of on-campus housing.
In addition to being luckv enough to
have high-speed Ethernet access and
avoiding long commutes from otf cam
pus, all students are equalh deserving
of the chancc to live in a residential
community that fosters soii.il interac
tion and intc llei 111.11 ex< hange.

'Stuffing' option not feasible

As a doctoral student who lost in the

As a ps\< liologv graduate student, I was

Klinksiek's letter 'misguided'
I lie suggest i<ni (in Brian Klinksiek's Mav

9 letter, "University 'needs to examine the
relative worth ot its graduate students' )
that an engineering master's student
may be worth less to the I niversity than
a humanities doctoral student, and that
this be considered as a basis lor deter
mining priority tot on-iampus housing,
is ridiculous. 1 think many people would
'agree that they are tired <>l hearing
opinions that engineering, technical,
business and other pre-professional ed
ucation and careers are less intellectual
.uicl less valuable to the intellectual (0111-
munitv. I tigli pay does not imply low in
tellectual value, and low pay does not
imply high intellectual value. Is it too
difficult to imagine that people are
drawn to engineering disc iplincs tot the
intellectual value rather than the high
pay? It is a double standard for engi
neering students to be expec ted to rec
ognize the value of humanities educa
tion while people feel it is acceptable to
denounce the value of engineering and
the people who work in engineering.
The perception that humanities
doctoral students are less able to af
ford housing than engineering mas
ter's students — the two groups in
Klinksiek's letter — is also misguided.
While an engineering master's student
may earn mote than a humanities dcx -
toral student after graduation, there is
no wav that basing housing priorities
on proje( ted future earnings could be
fair. Some engineering students de
cide to pursue low-paving jobs in
teaching, government or non-profit
organizations, and some humanities
graduate students decide to pursue
high-paving jobs in c onsulting 01 man
agement positions in business. I bete
is no wav to predict the true future fi
nancial situation of any student. I bus,
any priority scheme based 011 financial
situation must be based on the c 111 rem
financial situation, not (lie future.
Contrary to some people's opin
ions, I would argue that engineering

graduate students art* no better off fi
nancially, it not worse off, than hu
manities graduate students while in
school. In fait, there is evidence for
the latter. Engineering master's stu
dents are rarelv offered financial assis
tant e, while humanities doctoral stu
dents are almost always offered assis
tantships, it not fellowships. A two
\eat engineering mastei's ptogram
(an quit kl \ put a student m $(>O,OOO ot
additional debt.
In addition, even .1 ">0 pert cut assis
tantship has a financial value with the
stipend .ind tuition approximately
equal to $10,000, which is mm li more
than most engineering students with
out assist.tntships can even 111.ike in
high-paving programming jobs while
111 school.
Most engineering master's students
enter directlv from undergraduate
programs and have 110 more prior
earnings and savings than a humani
ties student might have. Also, engi
neering master's students come dis
proportionately from developing
countries like India and China where
the per capita income is on the order
of one-tenth that of the I nited States,
and their savings would hardly make a
contribution toward their current cost
of living and education, 112 uture earn
ings. however high, have absolutely no
bearing 011 whether students can af
ford housing now.
Below-market rent is also not the
sole purpose of on-campus housing.
In addition to being luckv enough to
have high-speed Ethernet access and
avoiding long commutes from otf cam
pus, all students are equalh deserving
of the chancc to live in a residential
community that fosters soii.il interac

Senior lauds instruction, value
of American Studies program
1 .1111 writing to express my shock and
displeasure .it the Fai ultv Senate's renew
al of the American Studies program for
onh three vears instead of the normal five.
I he decision disregarded a recommenda
tion from the (Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies that the program should be re
newed for five years. Members of the Fac
ult\ Senate had three major concerns: the
number of students in American studies,
an idea that tin- major larks focus and .1
feat that there are not enough faculty
committed to the program. Though the
Faculty Senate's intentions are good, these
criticisms demonstrate a lack of research
and understanding about the American
Studies program.
When Comparative Studies in Race and
Kthnicity became .1 major, American Stud
ies student enrollment numbers waned
slightly. This was natural and expected be
cause, up to that point, American studies
provided an outlet for students whose pri
mary focus was race. But in the years since,
the American Studies program has been
growing again. It currently boasts B.S ma
jors— twice as many as philosophy, c las
sics, religious studies or drama — and
nearly as many as communication and po
litic. il sc ienc e. Prof . Russell Herman's state
ment that they "could not ignore the de
cline" exaggerated a small, temporary clip
and disregarded the reasons for it, as well
as the comparative strength of the overall
numbers in the major.
Secondly, the American studies major

lacks neither intellectual focus nor aca
demic rigor. There are five required
courses, one of wliic h is a seminar — and
.111 additional seminar requirement.
American studies majors have to fill
breadth requirements in tour separate
areas of American studies: Visual and
Material Culture, History and Society,
Politics, Policy and Fconcunics and Liter
ature and Thought — one of which they
must declat c as a primary focus, complet
ing five 01 more courses in il. Finally,
there is a multiple-course race and eth
nicity requirement.
The focus and requirements c reate a
comprehensive understanding of the field
of American studies as a whole. I he major
is not a mere "mish mash." but a disc rete
field of study. I « hallcngc anyone who as
serts otherwise to sit in on the required
courses for the major. American studies is
no more of a cobbled-together conglom
eration than human biology, symbolic sys
tems, Asian-American studies or French
and Italian. Its interdisciplinary quality is
integral to its coherence as a program.
It approaches America the way Ger
man studies approaches Germany —
seeking to understand a people and their
country through history, language, litera
ture, politics and art rather than one sin
gle, narrow lens.
Finally, perhaps the most paradoxical
criticism by the Faculty Senate was that the
American Studies Program has an insuffi
cient number of tenure-track fac ultv com
mitted to it. I fere, it is important to distin
guish between "teaching" and "commit
ment." Certainly, there are dozens of

tenured I.unity from other departments
who teach in American studies. The Fac
ultv Senate's concern is that some of the
main American studies positions are held
In individuals who are phenomenal teach
ers hut are "senior lecturers" rather than
tenure-track faculty. I his may be true, es
pecially with a few looming retirements,
hut Stanford has tlie power to remedy this.
I lie University refuses to make faculty ap
pointments in "programs," only hiring

Klinksiek's letter 'misguided'
I lie suggest i<ni (in Brian Klinksiek's Mav

9 letter, "University 'needs to examine the
relative worth ot its graduate students' )
that an engineering master's student
may be worth less to the I niversity than
a humanities doctoral student, and that
this be considered as a basis lor deter
mining priority tot on-iampus housing,
is ridiculous. 1 think many people would
'agree that they are tired <>l hearing
opinions that engineering, technical,
business and other pre-professional ed
ucation and careers are less intellectual
.uicl less valuable to the intellectual (0111-
munitv. I tigli pay does not imply low in
tellectual value, and low pay does not
imply high intellectual value. Is it too
difficult to imagine that people are
drawn to engineering disc iplincs tot the
intellectual value rather than the high
pay? It is a double standard for engi
neering students to be expec ted to rec
ognize the value of humanities educa
tion while people feel it is acceptable to
denounce the value of engineering and
the people who work in engineering.
The perception that humanities
doctoral students are less able to af
ford housing than engineering mas
ter's students — the two groups in
Klinksiek's letter — is also misguided.
While an engineering master's student
may earn mote than a humanities dcx -
toral student after graduation, there is
no wav that basing housing priorities
on proje( ted future earnings could be
fair. Some engineering students de
cide to pursue low-paving jobs in
teaching, government or non-profit
organizations, and some humanities
graduate students decide to pursue
high-paving jobs in c onsulting 01 man
agement positions in business. I bete
is no wav to predict the true future fi
nancial situation of any student. I bus,
any priority scheme based 011 financial
situation must be based on the c 111 rem
financial situation, not (lie future.
Contrary to some people's opin
ions, I would argue that engineering

graduate students art* no better off fi
nancially, it not worse off, than hu
manities graduate students while in
school. In fait, there is evidence for
the latter. Engineering master's stu
dents are rarelv offered financial assis
tant e, while humanities doctoral stu
dents are almost always offered assis
tantships, it not fellowships. A two

In addition, even .1 ">0 pert cut assis

stipend .ind tuition approximately
equal to $10,000, which is mm li more
than most engineering students with
out assist.tntships can even 111.ike in
high-paving programming jobs while
111 school.
Most engineering master's students
enter directlv from undergraduate
programs and have 110 more prior
earnings and savings than a humani
ties student might have. Also, engi
neering master's students come dis
proportionately from developing
countries like India and China where
the per capita income is on the order

and their savings would hardly make a
contribution toward their current cost
of living and education, 112 uture earn
ings. however high, have absolutely no
bearing 011 whether students can af

Below-market rent is also not the
sole purpose of on-campus housing.
In addition to being luckv enough to

Senior lauds instruction, value
of American Studies program
1 .1111 writing to express my shock and
displeasure .it the Fai ultv Senate's renew
al of the American Studies program for
onh three vears instead of the normal five.
I he decision disregarded a recommenda
tion from the (Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies that the program should be re
newed for five years. Members of the Fac
ult\ Senate had three major concerns: the
number of students in American studies,
an idea that tin- major larks focus and .1
feat that there are not enough faculty
committed to the program. Though the
Faculty Senate's intentions are good, these
criticisms demonstrate a lack of research
and understanding about the American
Studies program.
When Comparative Studies in Race and
Kthnicity became .1 major, American Stud
ies student enrollment numbers waned
slightly. This was natural and expected be
cause, up to that point, American studies
provided an outlet for students whose pri
mary focus was race. But in the years since,
the American Studies program has been
growing again. It currently boasts B.S ma
jors— twice as many as philosophy, c las
sics, religious studies or drama — and
nearly as many as communication and po
litic. il sc ienc e. Prof . Russell Herman's state
ment that they "could not ignore the de
cline" exaggerated a small, temporary clip
and disregarded the reasons for it, as well
as the comparative strength of the overall
numbers in the major.
Secondly, the American studies major

lacks neither intellectual focus nor aca
demic rigor. There are five required
courses, one of wliic h is a seminar — and
.111 additional seminar requirement.
American studies majors have to fill
breadth requirements in tour separate
areas of American studies: Visual and
Material Culture, History and Society,
Politics, Policy and Fconcunics and Liter
ature and Thought — one of which they
must declat c as a primary focus, complet
ing five 01 more courses in il. Finally,
there is a multiple-course race and eth
nicity requirement.
The focus and requirements c reate a
comprehensive understanding of the field
of American studies as a whole. I he major
is not a mere "mish mash." but a disc rete
field of study. I « hallcngc anyone who as
serts otherwise to sit in on the required
courses for the major. American studies is
no more of a cobbled-together conglom
eration than human biology, symbolic sys
tems, Asian-American studies or French
and Italian. Its interdisciplinary quality is
integral to its coherence as a program.
It approaches America the way Ger
man studies approaches Germany —
seeking to understand a people and their
country through history, language, litera
ture, politics and art rather than one sin
gle, narrow lens.
Finally, perhaps the most paradoxical
criticism by the Faculty Senate was that the
American Studies Program has an insuffi
cient number of tenure-track fac ultv com
mitted to it. I fere, it is important to distin
guish between "teaching" and "commit
ment." Certainly, there are dozens of

tenured I.unity from other departments
who teach in American studies. The Fac
ultv Senate's concern is that some of the
main American studies positions are held
In individuals who are phenomenal teach
ers hut are "senior lecturers" rather than
tenure-track faculty. I his may be true, es
pecially with a few looming retirements,
hut Stanford has tlie power to remedy this.
I lie University refuses to make faculty ap
pointments in "programs," only hiring
"senior lecturers" in American studies.
I lius, any faculty interested in commit
ting to American studies take the program
on as ,i secondary commitment, which
would mean time away from their prima
ry department with no occupational in
centive—cspecially for junior faculty who
are encouraged to fix us on getting tenure
in their departments.
It is not as though American studies is
an obscure field; Yale University and
New York University have full-fledged
American studies departments, complete
with graduate students and hefty faculty
r< >sters.
1 112 Stanford doesn't take American stud
ies seriously, what incentive would top
Americanists have to choose Stanford over
Yale or NYU? The answer lies not in
threatening or "challenging" American
studies to change, but in giving it more
support so that it will have the ability to at
tract and keep faculty the same way de
partments can.
On a personal level, American studies
has been crucial in shaping my time at
Stanford. It has provided me intellectual
tcnus and a dynamic, intelligent academic
community — .is it has tot hundreds ol
other Stanford undergraduates who have
moved on to leadership roles in business,
law, education and academia. 1 hope that,
in the next three years, the I niversit\ will
research and reflect upon the positive im
pact American studies has had at Stan
ford— and that the program will be
granted the support and respei tit so rich

business and other pre-professional ed
ucation and careers are less intellectual
.uicl less valuable to the intellectual (0111-
munitv. I tigli pay does not imply low in
tellectual value, and low pay does not
imply high intellectual value. Is it too
difficult to imagine that people are
drawn to engineering disc iplincs tot the
intellectual value rather than the high
pay? It is a double standard for engi
neering students to be expec ted to rec
ognize the value of humanities educa
tion while people feel it is acceptable to
denounce the value of engineering and
the people who work in engineering.
The perception that humanities
doctoral students are less able to af
ford housing than engineering mas
ter's students — the two groups in
Klinksiek's letter — is also misguided.
While an engineering master's student
may earn mote than a humanities dcx -
toral student after graduation, there is
no wav that basing housing priorities
on proje( ted future earnings could be
fair. Some engineering students de
cide to pursue low-paving jobs in
teaching, government or non-profit
organizations, and some humanities
graduate students decide to pursue
high-paving jobs in c onsulting 01 man
agement positions in business. I bete
is no wav to predict the true future fi
nancial situation of any student. I bus,
any priority scheme based 011 financial
situation must be based on the c 111 rem
financial situation, not (lie future.
Contrary to some people's opin
ions, I would argue that engineering

graduate students art* no better off fi
nancially, it not worse off, than hu
manities graduate students while in
school. In fait, there is evidence for
the latter. Engineering master's stu
dents are rarelv offered financial assis
tant e, while humanities doctoral stu
dents are almost always offered assis
tantships, it not fellowships. A two

additional debt.
In addition, even .1 ">0 pert cut assis
tantship has a financial value with the
stipend .ind tuition approximately
equal to $10,000, which is mm li more
than most engineering students with
out assist.tntships can even 111.ike in
high-paving programming jobs while
111 school.
Most engineering master's students
enter directlv from undergraduate
programs and have 110 more prior
earnings and savings than a humani
ties student might have. Also, engi
neering master's students come dis
proportionately from developing
countries like India and China where
the per capita income is on the order
of one-tenth that of the I nited States,
and their savings would hardly make a
contribution toward their current cost
of living and education, 112 uture earn
ings. however high, have absolutely no
bearing 011 whether students can af
ford housing now.
Below-market rent is also not the
sole purpose of on-campus housing.
In addition to being luckv enough to
have high-speed Ethernet access and
avoiding long commutes from otf cam
pus, all students are equalh deserving
of the chancc to live in a residential
community that fosters soii.il interac
