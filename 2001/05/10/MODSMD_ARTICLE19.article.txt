Senior lauds instruction, value
of American Studies program
1 .1111 writing to express my shock and
displeasure .it the Fai ultv Senate's renew
al of the American Studies program for
onh three vears instead of the normal five.
I he decision disregarded a recommenda
tion from the (Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies that the program should be re
newed for five years. Members of the Fac
ult\ Senate had three major concerns: the
number of students in American studies,
an idea that tin- major larks focus and .1
feat that there are not enough faculty
committed to the program. Though the
Faculty Senate's intentions are good, these
criticisms demonstrate a lack of research
and understanding about the American
Studies program.
When Comparative Studies in Race and
Kthnicity became .1 major, American Stud
ies student enrollment numbers waned
slightly. This was natural and expected be
cause, up to that point, American studies
provided an outlet for students whose pri
mary focus was race. But in the years since,
the American Studies program has been
growing again. It currently boasts B.S ma
jors— twice as many as philosophy, c las
sics, religious studies or drama — and
nearly as many as communication and po
litic. il sc ienc e. Prof . Russell Herman's state
ment that they "could not ignore the de
cline" exaggerated a small, temporary clip
and disregarded the reasons for it, as well
as the comparative strength of the overall
numbers in the major.
Secondly, the American studies major

lacks neither intellectual focus nor aca
demic rigor. There are five required
courses, one of wliic h is a seminar — and
.111 additional seminar requirement.
American studies majors have to fill
breadth requirements in tour separate
areas of American studies: Visual and
Material Culture, History and Society,
Politics, Policy and Fconcunics and Liter
ature and Thought — one of which they
must declat c as a primary focus, complet
ing five 01 more courses in il. Finally,
there is a multiple-course race and eth
nicity requirement.
The focus and requirements c reate a
comprehensive understanding of the field
of American studies as a whole. I he major
is not a mere "mish mash." but a disc rete
field of study. I « hallcngc anyone who as
serts otherwise to sit in on the required
courses for the major. American studies is
no more of a cobbled-together conglom
eration than human biology, symbolic sys
tems, Asian-American studies or French
and Italian. Its interdisciplinary quality is
integral to its coherence as a program.
It approaches America the way Ger
man studies approaches Germany —
seeking to understand a people and their
country through history, language, litera
ture, politics and art rather than one sin
gle, narrow lens.
Finally, perhaps the most paradoxical
criticism by the Faculty Senate was that the
American Studies Program has an insuffi
cient number of tenure-track fac ultv com
mitted to it. I fere, it is important to distin
guish between "teaching" and "commit
ment." Certainly, there are dozens of

tenured I.unity from other departments
who teach in American studies. The Fac
ultv Senate's concern is that some of the
main American studies positions are held
In individuals who are phenomenal teach
ers hut are "senior lecturers" rather than
tenure-track faculty. I his may be true, es
pecially with a few looming retirements,
hut Stanford has tlie power to remedy this.
I lie University refuses to make faculty ap
pointments in "programs," only hiring
"senior lecturers" in American studies.
I lius, any faculty interested in commit
ting to American studies take the program
on as ,i secondary commitment, which
would mean time away from their prima
ry department with no occupational in
centive—cspecially for junior faculty who
are encouraged to fix us on getting tenure
in their departments.
It is not as though American studies is
an obscure field; Yale University and
New York University have full-fledged
American studies departments, complete
with graduate students and hefty faculty
r< >sters.
1 112 Stanford doesn't take American stud
ies seriously, what incentive would top
Americanists have to choose Stanford over
Yale or NYU? The answer lies not in
threatening or "challenging" American
studies to change, but in giving it more
support so that it will have the ability to at
tract and keep faculty the same way de
partments can.
On a personal level, American studies
has been crucial in shaping my time at
