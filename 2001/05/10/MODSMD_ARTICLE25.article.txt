opportunity to avenge two of its 13 losses of
the season .uul potentiallv regain some of
the momentum that drove the squad to
No. I in the Baseball America poll for six
consecutive weeks.
1 uesdav night, Stanford rallied from
three runs down to beat the Mustangs
(28-21) and managed to introduce some

Cardinal rallied fiom 10-8 after the
homerun in the ninth.
"I was just trying to get on base any wav
1 could," Quentin said of his homerun. "1
was sitting fastball, but he threw me a
changeup. 1 just reacted reallv well to it."
Quentin played a pivotal role in Stan
ford's first ninth-inning comeback of the
year as well. I lit* Mustangs c hose to walk
sophomore Jason Cooper with first base
open, hoping to preserve a one-run lead
with one out. However, the move put
Quentin at the plate and lie came through
with a bloop-single to left field to tie the ball

the momentum that drove the squad to
No. I in the Baseball America poll for six
consecutive weeks.
1 uesdav night, Stanford rallied from
three runs down to beat the Mustangs
(28-21) and managed to introduce some
poetic justice in the process. In the Jan.

man |(>hii Hudgins had walked Scott
Neal with the bases full to give (lal Polv a
()-i) win in I 1 innings.
" Ihis was a g<x>d victory for us," said

in the second inning to give the Cardinal a
2-0 lead, then drove in another run in the

fifth with a sacrifice fly to regain the lead,
making it a 5-4 contest.

to lead off the Stanford eighth, Quentin
became the first Cardinal plaver this sea
son to hit two homeruns in one game, 112 le
also ignited the Stanford bats, and the
Cardinal rallied fiom 10-8 after the
homerun in the ninth.
"I was just trying to get on base any wav
1 could," Quentin said of his homerun. "1
