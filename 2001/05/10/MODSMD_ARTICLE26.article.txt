# The
						inside scoop on the best and worst of sports fans
## 
### 
Okav, so it's not often that sports
writers go ( >n the disabled list.
Kut, <i month ago, 1 broke my
collarbone, which has put me
and my column 011 the sidelines for the last
couple weeks.
1 haven't been able to play any sports,
I've had to watch even more than usual.
Besides checking out some great hockey,
basketball and baseball, I've gotten a
chance to see the variety of tans the sports
world has to otter.
So, here they are, my conspicuously in
complete and thoroughly unofficial rank
ings of the best and worst fans in all of
sports...
The Best
No. 5 —The Boston Red Sox. So this

one might be .i little bit ol
a concession to mv friends
from Boston and certain
ly a large bit out of pity to
the plight of the Sox since
Mils, but, it \«mi have
been to a game .it Fenwa\,
you know what I mean.
Fora somewhat dec repit
and ( tumbling piece of

early century architecture, it is .1 majestic
place to watch a game. I nless vou're a
Yankees fan, vou can't help I >tit love the
Red Sox after seeing a game there. I he
fans are knowledgeable, ccrtainh spirited
and, more than anything, want to win so
badly.
No. 4 — The IJniversit\ of Nebraska.
I'm going to spare you am overdone,

Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea
metaphors, but a Nebraska home foot
ball game is certainly the only giant red
spot on Karth visible from space. On
.Saturdays in the fall, their stadium be
comes the second largest city in the
state. 1 hcse guys are mobile and hostile
as well. At the NCAA Baseball Super Re
gion.il last spring, the Nebraska fans
came close to outnumbering and cer
tainlv outyelled the Stanford boosters ...
at Sunken Diamond!
\<>. — I he ()akland As. The Raiders
fans get all the press, but the really motley
(lew from the l\ast Bay (with the excep
tion of Cal's dance team) is the fans in
green and gold. Even with the A's in an
carlv-scason funk this year, their fans are
still among the rowdiest in the sport, beat

ing drums, waving flags and cheering
everything their team does. No trip to the
Network Associates Coliseum is complete
without hearing a bleacher denizen wax
eloquently about the dominance of I upac
and West Coast flip Hop over Notorious
8.1.C. and the East.
No. 2 — British Soccer Hooligans.
They're called "hooligans" tor (iod's sake
What more do you want? Am bunch that
includes face paint, Newcastle Brown and
the headbutt as part of its arsenal deserves
credit from me.
No. I — NASCAR fans. In true South
ern fashion, 1 got the opportunity to at
tend a NASCAR race in l)allas earlier this
year. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no
greater spectacle on the face of the Earth.
It's like the Barnum & Bailey circus

crossed with a giant Wal-Mart and doused
with cheap beer, complete with over
15,000 motor homes in the parking lot. To
show their love, each and every one of the
250,000 spec tators in attendance wore .it
least five pieces of NASCAR merchandise
featuring the sponsor of their favorite dri
ver. from the Budweisercar of Dale Earn
hardt Jr. to the Viagra car of Mark Martin.
Any time I see a grown man wearing a
|500 leather jacket with Viagra ac ross the
back and a S< h1 it / in each hand, I know
lie's a true fan.
Honorable Mention — Texas A&M's
" 12th Man" football fans. Denver Broncos
fans. Minor League Hoc kev fans.
And, now:
