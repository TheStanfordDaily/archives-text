# The 						inside scoop on the best and worst of sports fans
## 
### 
Okav, so it's not often that sports
writers go ( >n the disabled list.
Kut, <i month ago, 1 broke my
collarbone, which has put me
and my column 011 the sidelines for the last
couple weeks.
1 haven't been able to play any sports,
I've had to watch even more than usual.
Besides checking out some great hockey,
basketball and baseball, I've gotten a
chance to see the variety of tans the sports
world has to otter.
So, here they are, my conspicuously in
complete and thoroughly unofficial rank
ings of the best and worst fans in all of
sports...
The Best
No. 5 —The Boston Red Sox. So this

one might be .i little bit ol
a concession to mv friends
from Boston and certain
ly a large bit out of pity to
the plight of the Sox since
Mils, but, it \«mi have
been to a game .it Fenwa\,
you know what I mean.
Fora somewhat dec repit
and ( tumbling piece of

early century architecture, it is .1 majestic
place to watch a game. I nless vou're a
Yankees fan, vou can't help I >tit love the
Red Sox after seeing a game there. I he
fans are knowledgeable, ccrtainh spirited
and, more than anything, want to win so
badly.
No. 4 — The IJniversit\ of Nebraska.
I'm going to spare you am overdone,

Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea
metaphors, but a Nebraska home foot
ball game is certainly the only giant red
spot on Karth visible from space. On
.Saturdays in the fall, their stadium be
comes the second largest city in the
state. 1 hcse guys are mobile and hostile
as well. At the NCAA Baseball Super Re
gion.il last spring, the Nebraska fans
came close to outnumbering and cer
tainlv outyelled the Stanford boosters ...
at Sunken Diamond!
\<>. — I he ()akland As. The Raiders
fans get all the press, but the really motley
(lew from the l\ast Bay (with the excep
tion of Cal's dance team) is the fans in
green and gold. Even with the A's in an
carlv-scason funk this year, their fans are
still among the rowdiest in the sport, beat

ing drums, waving flags and cheering
everything their team does. No trip to the
Network Associates Coliseum is complete
without hearing a bleacher denizen wax
eloquently about the dominance of I upac
and West Coast flip Hop over Notorious
8.1.C. and the East.
No. 2 — British Soccer Hooligans.
They're called "hooligans" tor (iod's sake
What more do you want? Am bunch that
includes face paint, Newcastle Brown and
the headbutt as part of its arsenal deserves
credit from me.
No. I — NASCAR fans. In true South
ern fashion, 1 got the opportunity to at
tend a NASCAR race in l)allas earlier this
year. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no
greater spectacle on the face of the Earth.
It's like the Barnum & Bailey circus

crossed with a giant Wal-Mart and doused
with cheap beer, complete with over
15,000 motor homes in the parking lot. To
show their love, each and every one of the
250,000 spec tators in attendance wore .it
least five pieces of NASCAR merchandise
featuring the sponsor of their favorite dri
ver. from the Budweisercar of Dale Earn
hardt Jr. to the Viagra car of Mark Martin.
Any time I see a grown man wearing a
|500 leather jacket with Viagra ac ross the
back and a S< h1 it / in each hand, I know
lie's a true fan.
Honorable Mention — Texas A&M's
" 12th Man" football fans. Denver Broncos
fans. Minor League Hoc kev fans.
And, now:


Ben Jones
The Worst
No. :> — I he Montreal Fxpos.
What happens il thc\ held a Major
League Baseball game and no one
( heered? I)(>es anvone hear il? At
tendance totals in the low "four
dibits' are conmion at Montreal's
cavernous (Mvmpic Stadium. I'lus,
Montreal's mascot, Youppi
which looks like the illegitimate
love child of Big Bird and Frnie —
downright sc ares me.
No. I — I he Minnesota Twins.
1 couldn't l>e happier for the hot
start the 1 winkies are off to this

season, but last week's attack on
Chuck Knoblauch was a little
much. Sure, the guy left your c Inh
to "play fora winner," but he
couldn't throw a ball from second
base to first if the fate of the planet
was upon his shoulders. Cut him
some slack.
No. H — The Chicago Bulls.
Would you c heer lor Dragan 1 ar
lac, Fred Hoiberg and Dalibor
Bagaric? Me, neither.
No. 2 — The Dallas Stars.
Don't get me wrong, I love my
hometown as much .is anvone,
but these guys are the worst.
First off, it's a farce that Fexas
has a hockey team in the first
place. There's about as much
ice in the state as in your aver

age Slurpee machine. And
when the Stars were awful, folks
in Dallas cared more about
whether it was beef ribs or pork
ribs for dinner than they did
about hockey. Lo and behold,
the Stars gel good, and you've
got rednecks from I).ill.is talk
ing hockey like thev think
thev're from Saskatoon and act
ing like these gu\s are the sec
ond coming of the Cowboys in
skates and sweaters. Fail weath
er fans at their worst.
No I — Cal fans. Need 1 sa\
more?

\<>. — I he ()akland As. The Raiders
fans get all the press, but the really motley
(lew from the l\ast Bay (with the excep
tion of Cal's dance team) is the fans in
green and gold. Even with the A's in an
carlv-scason funk this year, their fans are
still among the rowdiest in the sport, beat

ing drums, waving flags and cheering
everything their team does. No trip to the
Network Associates Coliseum is complete
without hearing a bleacher denizen wax
eloquently about the dominance of I upac
and West Coast flip Hop over Notorious
8.1.C. and the East.
No. 2 — British Soccer Hooligans.
They're called "hooligans" tor (iod's sake
What more do you want? Am bunch that
includes face paint, Newcastle Brown and
the headbutt as part of its arsenal deserves
credit from me.
No. I — NASCAR fans. In true South
ern fashion, 1 got the opportunity to at
tend a NASCAR race in l)allas earlier this
year. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no
greater spectacle on the face of the Earth.
It's like the Barnum & Bailey circus

crossed with a giant Wal-Mart and doused
with cheap beer, complete with over
15,000 motor homes in the parking lot. To
show their love, each and every one of the
250,000 spec tators in attendance wore .it
least five pieces of NASCAR merchandise
featuring the sponsor of their favorite dri
ver. from the Budweisercar of Dale Earn
hardt Jr. to the Viagra car of Mark Martin.
Any time I see a grown man wearing a
|500 leather jacket with Viagra ac ross the
back and a S< h1 it / in each hand, I know
lie's a true fan.
Honorable Mention — Texas A&M's
" 12th Man" football fans. Denver Broncos
fans. Minor League Hoc kev fans.
And, now:

The Worst
No. :> — I he Montreal Fxpos.
What happens il thc\ held a Major
League Baseball game and no one
( heered? I)(>es anvone hear il? At
tendance totals in the low "four
dibits' are conmion at Montreal's
cavernous (Mvmpic Stadium. I'lus,
Montreal's mascot, Youppi
which looks like the illegitimate
love child of Big Bird and Frnie —
downright sc ares me.
No. I — I he Minnesota Twins.
1 couldn't l>e happier for the hot
start the 1 winkies are off to this

season, but last week's attack on
Chuck Knoblauch was a little
much. Sure, the guy left your c Inh
to "play fora winner," but he
couldn't throw a ball from second
base to first if the fate of the planet
was upon his shoulders. Cut him
some slack.
No. H — The Chicago Bulls.
Would you c heer lor Dragan 1 ar
lac, Fred Hoiberg and Dalibor
Bagaric? Me, neither.
No. 2 — The Dallas Stars.
Don't get me wrong, I love my
hometown as much .is anvone,
but these guys are the worst.
First off, it's a farce that Fexas
has a hockey team in the first
place. There's about as much
ice in the state as in your aver

age Slurpee machine. And
when the Stars were awful, folks
in Dallas cared more about
whether it was beef ribs or pork
ribs for dinner than they did
about hockey. Lo and behold,
the Stars gel good, and you've
got rednecks from I).ill.is talk
ing hockey like thev think
thev're from Saskatoon and act
ing like these gu\s are the sec
ond coming of the Cowboys in
skates and sweaters. Fail weath
er fans at their worst.
No I — Cal fans. Need 1 sa\
more?

Okav, so it's not often that sports
writers go ( >n the disabled list.
Kut, <i month ago, 1 broke my
collarbone, which has put me
and my column 011 the sidelines for the last
couple weeks.
1 haven't been able to play any sports,
I've had to watch even more than usual.
Besides checking out some great hockey,
basketball and baseball, I've gotten a
chance to see the variety of tans the sports
world has to otter.
So, here they are, my conspicuously in
complete and thoroughly unofficial rank
ings of the best and worst fans in all of
sports...
The Best
No. 5 —The Boston Red Sox. So this

one might be .i little bit ol
a concession to mv friends
from Boston and certain
ly a large bit out of pity to
the plight of the Sox since
Mils, but, it \«mi have
been to a game .it Fenwa\,
you know what I mean.
Fora somewhat dec repit
and ( tumbling piece of

early century architecture, it is .1 majestic
place to watch a game. I nless vou're a
Yankees fan, vou can't help I >tit love the
Red Sox after seeing a game there. I he
fans are knowledgeable, ccrtainh spirited
and, more than anything, want to win so
badly.
No. 4 — The IJniversit\ of Nebraska.
I'm going to spare you am overdone,

Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea
metaphors, but a Nebraska home foot
ball game is certainly the only giant red
spot on Karth visible from space. On
.Saturdays in the fall, their stadium be
comes the second largest city in the
state. 1 hcse guys are mobile and hostile
as well. At the NCAA Baseball Super Re
gion.il last spring, the Nebraska fans
