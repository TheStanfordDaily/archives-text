### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's tennis was never this good.
Kefore current head coach Dick (iould took
the reins in 1907 from his own coach, Robert
Renker, the (Cardinal had never won the tennis
N( AA ( hampionship.
In lad, in Could's first three years as a coach,
the Cardinal finished 15th, 33rd and eighth in
the country, respectively.
Now, 709 wins and 35 years later. (iould has
created an unmatchable legacy on the Farm,
coaching his teams to an unprecedented 17
NCAA Men's l ennis Team Championships.
I lis ac complishments with the team and with
the individual players he has coached goes on
and on.
For example, along with attaining the Inter
collegiate I ennis Association (loach of the ear
on four separate occasions, the I I A honored
(iould as Coach of the Decade in men's colle
giate tennis in the 1980s and 19905.
Under his tutelage, a total of 10 different
Stanford players have claimed the singles na
tion. il title, and 43 of his players have earned
All-Anieric a honors. Some of these players have
included past and present professional stars
like Roscoe Tanner, ranked fifth in the world in
1979; (ienc Mayer, ranked fourth in 1980; Alex
Mayer, ranked seventh in 1982; Tim Mavotte,
ranked seventh in 1988. and. of course, the
volatile John McEnroe, who achieved the top
ranking in the world from 1980 to 1984.
Assoc. Head Coach John VVhitlinger attrib
utes (ioulcl's suc c esses to his relentless desire to

win and improve.
"I have learned so much from him," said
Whit linger, who plavcd for (iould from 1973
to 1975. "He is always looking to better the
program. I fe doesn't sit still. I le is always try
ing to gel better and be a step ahead of the
competition."
What makes his achievement even more
special is the fad that (iould does it with so
much humilitx and selflessness.
Instead of claiming an\ personal glory,
Could cites the import.nice of his team's
ac hievements in terms of showing that Stanford
is not |ust a one-dimensional s< hool concentrat
ed in academic s.
According to (iould. Stanford had onlv one
championship in am sport in the 1950s and
also only one title in the 1900s.
I his record of athletic futility was greatly
improved upon as Stanford, courtesy of
Could's four I cm in titles, won seven national
titles in the 197()'s.
"I took this job because 1 believed in Stan
ford so much and what Stanford had to offer,"
(iould said. "[ I lie tennis team's] sik (esses here
had much [to do with the) < hangc in the men
tality tli.it Stanford students are not all about
studying hard. We helped c hange the thought
tli.it student-athletes are not tough enough on
the field."
"I didn't believe [that Stanford could not
compete], and I'm really proud of the fad that
we helped changed that." he continued. "It is
such .i great model that athletics and academics
can work at the highest level in the right way.
As (iould continued to disc uss his career, he

never once mentioned his own awards and
records as a source of pride.
"Something that has really meant a lot to me
is that every player th.it has entered here since
the fall <>l 1969 has [left the team] with at least
one championship ring," Gould said. "The
other thing that I'm really proud of is that we
have not lost a player to transfer since 1973.
The players who have come here have really
liked the program."
()ne of the reasons athletes have stayed loyal
to the program has been the warm relationship
that Gould has been able to foster with them.
"Coach Gould is not only our tennis coach,
but he is also an amazing friend," said freshman
Kduardo Cardoso. "He understands our per
sonal problems and helps us on and off the ten
nis court. II one of us has problems off the
court, we can always count on coach."
|unior k.J. Hippensteel has also been ap
preciative of the mentor role that Gould has
taken.
"1 owe him a big part in me coming out of my
shell and being more outgoing and friendly to
people," he said. "1 truly am amazed how he
lias changed me not only on the court, but off
the court."
A native of Ventura, Gould started playing
tennis in a seventh-grade physical education
class and played through high school before
continuing a Gould family tradition by entering
Stanford in 19f>6.
He played on the team for four years, ma
jored in physical education and also earned a
