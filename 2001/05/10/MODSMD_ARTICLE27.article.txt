titles in the 197()'s.

records as a source of pride.
"Something that has really meant a lot to me
is that every player th.it has entered here since
the fall <>l 1969 has [left the team] with at least
one championship ring," Gould said. "The
other thing that I'm really proud of is that we
have not lost a player to transfer since 1973.
The players who have come here have really
liked the program."
()ne of the reasons athletes have stayed loyal
to the program has been the warm relationship
that Gould has been able to foster with them.
"Coach Gould is not only our tennis coach,

Kduardo Cardoso. "He understands our per

Head tennis coach Dick Gould has taken the Stanford program under his
wing leading the team to 17 national championships since taking over the
team in 1966.
master's degree at Stanford.
After college, Gould spent two
years coaching at Mountain View
High School and four years at
Foothills junior College, where
he won two state championships.
When his Stanford coach,
Renker, called it quits after 16
years, Gould applied and got
the job as Stanford head coach
in 1966.
He has not looked back since.
In his first six years at Stanford,
the team struggled but slowly im
proved Ix-forc achieving a second
place finish in 1972.

I hen the floodgates opened.
(iould helped Stanford win its
first title in 1973, repeated as c ham
pions in 1974, and won two more
times in the 19705. He also helped
garner the crown six times in the
1980s, six more in the 1990s and one
last year.
The fact that the team has won
seven more team championships
than the next closest school is a
tribute to Gould's ability to contin
uously instill the drive to win in his
players.
"The hard thing is winning
your first championships, and try
ing to sustain that is twice as hard,"
Gould said.
Hippensteel and senior Alex
Kim, who have played a com
bined seven years for Ciould, say

they have been in awe of the
freshness that Gould seems to
bring every year.
"I've l>een with him for almost
four years, and it seems like every
year, even after winning another na
tional title, he comes back hungrier,"
Kim said. "He never takes things for
granted, whether it's .1 dual match,
recniiting or fundraising."
Hip|X'iisteel agreed.
"You would think that a man
who has won 17 NCAA titles might
lx- a little complacent, but he ap
proaches each season as if he is gun
ning for his first title," fie said. "He
docs an excellent job of getting the
whole team to peak come May,
which is the most important time of
the year for us."
As if the pressures of coaching

were not enough, Gould has also
made a mark bv spearheading a
$25 million project to completely
endow the Stanford tennis pro
gram. According to him, the pro
ject is $4 to $5 million from being
fully endowed.

"In this job, I am allowed to be
an entrepreneur, and one of my
goals has been trying to make this
program totally self-sufficient," he
said. "It's been fun, and I've really
enjoyed the opportunity [to be an
entrepreneur]."

However, all good things must
come to an end.
According to (kxild, lie will pass
011 the team to Whit linger when one
of three things happens.
"First of all, if we go four years
without winninga ring, I will stop for
sure," he said. "1 would also love to
have this program fully endowed
[before I retire]. If we can do that in
the next few years, I would lcx>k very
closely at maybe passing it 011 to
John. Finally, if I ever had a feeling
that the kids were stalling to not lis
ten to me, and talking behind my
back, I would get out."
Ckmld hopes to retire into a di
rector of tennis position at Stanford.
As director, he would allow coaches
to concentrate 011 coaching.
However, (kmld cannot imagine

doing anything btir teaching.

Head tennis coach Dick Gould has taken the Stanford program under his
wing leading the team to 17 national championships since taking over the
team in 1966.

After college, Gould spent two
years coaching at Mountain View
High School and four years at
Foothills junior College, where
he won two state championships.
When his Stanford coach,
Renker, called it quits after 16
years, Gould applied and got
the job as Stanford head coach
in 1966.
He has not looked back since.
In his first six years at Stanford,
the team struggled but slowly im
proved Ix-forc achieving a second
place finish in 1972.

I hen the floodgates opened.
(iould helped Stanford win its
first title in 1973, repeated as c ham
pions in 1974, and won two more
times in the 19705. He also helped
garner the crown six times in the
1980s, six more in the 1990s and one
last year.
The fact that the team has won
seven more team championships
than the next closest school is a
tribute to Gould's ability to contin
uously instill the drive to win in his
players.
"The hard thing is winning
your first championships, and try
ing to sustain that is twice as hard,"
Gould said.
Hippensteel and senior Alex
Kim, who have played a com
bined seven years for Ciould, say

they have been in awe of the
freshness that Gould seems to
bring every year.
"I've l>een with him for almost
four years, and it seems like every
year, even after winning another na
tional title, he comes back hungrier,"
Kim said. "He never takes things for
granted, whether it's .1 dual match,
recniiting or fundraising."
Hip|X'iisteel agreed.
"You would think that a man
who has won 17 NCAA titles might
lx- a little complacent, but he ap
proaches each season as if he is gun
ning for his first title," fie said. "He
docs an excellent job of getting the
whole team to peak come May,
which is the most important time of
the year for us."
As if the pressures of coaching

were not enough, Gould has also
made a mark bv spearheading a
$25 million project to completely
endow the Stanford tennis pro
gram. According to him, the pro
ject is $4 to $5 million from being
fully endowed.

"In this job, I am allowed to be
an entrepreneur, and one of my
goals has been trying to make this
program totally self-sufficient," he
said. "It's been fun, and I've really
enjoyed the opportunity [to be an
entrepreneur]."

However, all good things must
come to an end.
According to (kxild, lie will pass
011 the team to Whit linger when one
of three things happens.
"First of all, if we go four years
without winninga ring, I will stop for

the next few years, I would lcx>k very
closely at maybe passing it 011 to

that the kids were stalling to not lis

back, I would get out."

Head tennis coach Dick Gould has taken the Stanford program under his
wing leading the team to 17 national championships since taking over the
team in 1966.
master's degree at Stanford.
After college, Gould spent two
years coaching at Mountain View
High School and four years at
Foothills junior College, where
he won two state championships.
When his Stanford coach,
Renker, called it quits after 16
years, Gould applied and got
the job as Stanford head coach
in 1966.
He has not looked back since.
In his first six years at Stanford,
the team struggled but slowly im
proved Ix-forc achieving a second
place finish in 1972.

I hen the floodgates opened.
(iould helped Stanford win its
first title in 1973, repeated as c ham
pions in 1974, and won two more
times in the 19705. He also helped
garner the crown six times in the
1980s, six more in the 1990s and one
last year.
The fact that the team has won
seven more team championships
than the next closest school is a
tribute to Gould's ability to contin
uously instill the drive to win in his
players.
"The hard thing is winning
your first championships, and try
ing to sustain that is twice as hard,"
Gould said.
Hippensteel and senior Alex
Kim, who have played a com
bined seven years for Ciould, say

they have been in awe of the
freshness that Gould seems to
bring every year.
"I've l>een with him for almost
four years, and it seems like every
year, even after winning another na
tional title, he comes back hungrier,"
Kim said. "He never takes things for
granted, whether it's .1 dual match,
recniiting or fundraising."
Hip|X'iisteel agreed.
"You would think that a man
who has won 17 NCAA titles might
lx- a little complacent, but he ap
proaches each season as if he is gun
ning for his first title," fie said. "He
docs an excellent job of getting the
whole team to peak come May,
which is the most important time of
the year for us."
As if the pressures of coaching

were not enough, Gould has also
made a mark bv spearheading a
$25 million project to completely
endow the Stanford tennis pro
gram. According to him, the pro
ject is $4 to $5 million from being
fully endowed.

"In this job, I am allowed to be
an entrepreneur, and one of my
goals has been trying to make this
program totally self-sufficient," he
said. "It's been fun, and I've really
enjoyed the opportunity [to be an
entrepreneur]."

However, all good things must
come to an end.
According to (kxild, lie will pass
011 the team to Whit linger when one
of three things happens.
"First of all, if we go four years
without winninga ring, I will stop for
sure," he said. "1 would also love to
have this program fully endowed
[before I retire]. If we can do that in
the next few years, I would lcx>k very
closely at maybe passing it 011 to
John. Finally, if I ever had a feeling
that the kids were stalling to not lis
ten to me, and talking behind my
back, I would get out."
Ckmld hopes to retire into a di
rector of tennis position at Stanford.
As director, he would allow coaches
to concentrate 011 coaching.
However, (kmld cannot imagine

doing anything btir teaching.

Kim sums it up with the following
distinction.
