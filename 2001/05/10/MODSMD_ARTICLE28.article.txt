# Crew prepares for Pac-10s
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT 
I lit- Cardinal men will take to the water this week
end in a race tor the Pacific 10 Conference title.
I he Pac-10 Championships will lx' held at Lake
Natonia in Sacramento this Saturday. The Cardinal
will 112 ace some of the best squads in the country as it
races against No. 1 California, No. 12 Washington and
()regon State.
Crew will compete in three of the four races this
weekend — the varsity eight, the varsity four and
the frosh/novice eight. The team comes in ranked
fourth in each event. Numbers prevent the Cardi
nal from entering the junior varsity race, so the
squad must have consistent finishes in all competing
races to place well.
Racing conditions at Lake Natonia are ideal fora
competition of this magnitude because there is com
plete fairness among the lanes. 1 his is important in
light of the calibei of (lie teams that will be rowing at
this meet.
1 his is race where previous records and times do
not matters, only the results at the end of the day on
Saturday count. Although the race is ultimately for the
Pac-10 title, it is open toother at-large collegiate crews.
Ihe main competition will be between Cal. Washing
ton, ()regon State, and Stanford.
" I liis is ,i tiered competition with definite separa
tion between Cal and Washington, Washington and
Oregon State, Oregon State and Stanford, Stanford
and I (.-Davis. Kacli crew wants to beat the next crew,"
said head coach ( aaig Anierklianian.
I his is the last rat e before the collegiate crew Inter
national Rowing Asscoiation National ('.hanipionships
are lie-Id on Memorial Day weekend. While onlv Cal
<md Washington will be seeded from the West, the Pac -
10 has become a stronghold in the sport. Cal has < ap
tured the national ( hampionship three out of the last
four years, thanks largely to its Olympic-caliber
squads. Four Pac-10 teams are expected to finish in the
top 20 and six in the top three.it nationals, making this
weekend especially competitive.
"We're going to be in the mix with a lot of crews fat

nationals], and we're not going to catch any breaks. It's
up to us to set ourselves apart," Amerkhanian said.
"The crew that performs well is going to finish on an
up note and be in a position where they're making
moves tor the IRA."
The Cardinal is looking fin a win against Oregon
State, but does not rule out sneaking up on Washing
ton toi an upset as well.
"()ur go.il for the weekend is to race 2000 meters
aggressively in the Stanford tradition," Anierklian
ian said.
There is mild concern tli.it the expected heat of this
weekend might hinder the crew teams, but the (Cardi
nal coaching staff has worked with the players to pre
pare them. The team has has been filling up on liquids
and has endured additional physical conditioning in
the warmer weather in order to become accustomed to
the heat.
I lie Cardinal is reach to put all its preparation into
action this weekend. ( lew's biggest hope is to avenge
its prior loss to Oregon State from earlier this vear.
()regon State is Stanford's best-matched competitor in
the league, although the Cardinal is not about to un
derestimate I d-Davis, which will hope to make a
strong showing against Stanfi>rd.
Stanford will first face Oregon in the morning
qualifying heat, before moving onto the finals later
that afternoon.
1 he final race will hold the top two finishers from
the morning heats, and it is expected that the Pac-10
teams will be there.
Stanford is also looking for strong finishes from its
men in the four-mail and freshman races because it
will need those points to place well <>verall, espec i.illy in
light of Stanford's lack of a junior \.u sit\ team.
I his is the most important race of the season thus
far for men's crew. After a learning season with its
ups and downs, the team is looking to put it togeth
er at Pac-10s.
"It's a great opportunity for Stanford ( rew to make
its first real statement this vear, to let people know and
view us in collegiate rowing that we're on the move,"
Amerkhanian said. "It's an c\( iting opportunity.''
