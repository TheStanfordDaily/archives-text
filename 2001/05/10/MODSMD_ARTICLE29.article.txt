### DANIELLE MURRAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I his weekend, the Stanford women's crew team
will look to show iis finest performance of the season
when ii competes at the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships. I lie team has had a two-week break from
ra< nig to prepare for the competition, and it hopes its
fix used practices will pav off.
" I hey're confident with the training they have, and
now its time fora great rat e," said head coach Aimee
Baker.
I his weekend marks the culmination of a great
war for the Stanford women's crew team, as well as
great lowing careers for the three graduating seniors
on the team, flold.i Biskeborn, co-captain Laurie
Mason and coxswain |illiau krell.
1 he women will enter four boats â€” a varsity eight,
junior varsity eight, novice eight and a novice light
weight four. I he eight-man boats will have prelimi
nary heats Sunday morning. The top two boats in each
of the three varsity eight heats will move on to the
gi and finals, which will be held that afternoon. The top
three boats iu the junior varsity and novice heats will
advance. The (Cardinal is seeded sixth in both the var
sit\ and junior varsity races, while the novice team
earned an impressive third-place seed.
I lie unseeded lightweight novice four races will be
held Saturday. I his will be the first time that Stanford
has entered a lightweight boat.
Stanford's varsity eight will fat e top-ranked South
ern California and seventh-seed Sacramento State in
it's heat Sunday. I he Cardinal lost to USC by 17 sec
onds in 1 .os Angeles during the last race of the season.
"We beat Sacramento State by 13 seconds back in
March," Baker said. "They'll put up a good race be
cause they're going to want to make the grand final,
and that will be their big race of the day."
Bakei expe< ts the varsity to make it into the grand
final, but, from there, the outcome will depend on the
rowers' performance.
If we row average, we'll go in six and come out

six," Baker said. "II it's a good race, then we'll come
out fifth. We'll need to have a great race to beat two re
ally great crews and come in fourth."
In the past years, the top four teams from the Pac
-10 have gone 011 to compete 111 the NCAA Champi
onships. Because of the addition <>112 a fifth region this
year, there may be fewer VV'estei 11 teams invited to na
tionals. I herefbre, a fourth place finish .it I'ac -1 ()s will
not guarantee a national bid.
The junior varsity team will face I ( .-Davis, Wash
ington State, Sacramento State, I SC and UC-Santa
Barbara in its heat.
I he junior varsity team's big race is going to be the
heat, Baker said. "Davis appears to have been pretty
even with us for the last few years, and we see them in the
heat. It II be Stanford or 1 )avis who advance to the final.
I he main goal for the J V is to make the grand final."
Despite their third-place seed, the novice eight
drew a rough heat. It will fine UC-Davis, San Diego
State and ()regon State, all of which n lias raced earli
er in the season.
"It looks like it's going to be a fight between Davis
and San Diego State, Baker said. "Both teams have
proved to be pretty tough, along with ()regon State."
I he (Cardinal had a narrow win over ()regon State
at the Stanford Invitational, taking the rate by only
tlnec-tenths of a second. At the San I)iego (irew (Clas
sic, Stanford's novice boat had anothci tight race, de
feating l'()-Davis by seven-tenths of a second.
We ve been pretty c lose with everyone we're rac -
ing with, especially at the- San Diego Crew (lassie, so
we don't want to overlook anyone," Baker said.
Last year, the women only took ninth place in the
varsity race, after being defeated in their first heat.
I hey enter this weekend's races with much higher
hopes.
"All three boats have a good c hance," Baker said.
"We plan to be in the final."
Racing will be held on Lake Natoma in Rancho
Cordova. I he preliminary heats will take place be
tween K a.m. and 10:30 a.m. Sunday morning, and the
finals will follow that afternoon, from I p.m. to 3 p.m..
