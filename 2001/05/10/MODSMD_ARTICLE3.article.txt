temptations to violate the Ilonor (-ode."
Ac (ording to oflic ial I lonor (lode guide

"It is not 111 peoples consciousness

enough," said Judicial Adviser Laurette
lieeson. She said she frequently receives
complaints from students about profes
sors setting take-home or closed-book
exams or other procedures not in keep
ing with the I lonor (lode.
"Students call me .ill the time," liee
sou said. "I encourage them to talk to

I heir professors about it because
the\ just may not know. ()i I call
the professor."
Sometimes, the ignorance is
department-wide. "I've tailed
department chairs in those t ir
< umstanies. For the most part,
faculty members are receptive,"
she said.
Diann McCants, the associate
director of the Program in
African-American Studies and .1
ps\( hologv professor, admits that
Honor ( '.ode awareness 11111s low
among faculty.
"Professors don't really deal
with it or read it completely," Mc-
Cains said. "Most are just occu

Visiting Prof. James Potter,
who taught at Stanford during

even aware that the I niversitv
had an Honor (lode. Only dur
ing finals did he line! out from Ins

teaching assistant that "profes
sors were not allowed in to sta\ in
the room when students were
taking an exam."
It is one thing for professors
not to know the code, but it can
have more serious consequences
for students. Many students
brush aside this concei n. pointing
out that, at its heart, the Honor
( ode is all common sense.
"You have to sign the blue
books even time before you take

said. "And even il von don't read

Senior Moe\ < )sborn's ( lass was given
a midterm lest with msii ut lions to spend
not more than two hours on it. I lie
catch: I hey could take it home, and had
until the next dav to turn it in.
I he professor's instructions were a
< l.issit ease ol "procedures that c reate

temptations to violate the Ilonor (-ode."
Ac (ording to oflic ial I lonor (lode guide
lines. setting a time limit tor a take-home
exam would disadvantage "honorable
and conscientious students," relative to
(lassmates who sui render to the tempta
tion of spending longer on the exam.
I lie lac ultv h.is collectivelv vowed to
uphold its end of the Honor Code. F.vi
clentlv, Osborn's professor was not

aware of the fine print.
When a student informed the fac ultv
member of the glitch after the midterm,
the procedures were rectified for the
final exam. I lie c ase is not an isolated
one. Although the Honor Code is in
tended to form the I),k kbone for ac ade
mic conduct, most students and profes
sors may not be (lear 011 .ill of its rules.
"It is not 111 peoples consciousness

enough," said Judicial Adviser Laurette
lieeson. She said she frequently receives
complaints from students about profes
sors setting take-home or closed-book
exams or other procedures not in keep
ing with the I lonor (lode.
"Students call me .ill the time," liee
sou said. "I encourage them to talk to

I heir professors about it because
the\ just may not know. ()i I call
the professor."
Sometimes, the ignorance is
department-wide. "I've tailed
department chairs in those t ir
< umstanies. For the most part,
faculty members are receptive,"
she said.
Diann McCants, the associate
director of the Program in
African-American Studies and .1
ps\( hologv professor, admits that
Honor ( '.ode awareness 11111s low
among faculty.
"Professors don't really deal
with it or read it completely," Mc-
Cains said. "Most are just occu
pied with teaching."
Visiting Prof. James Potter,
who taught at Stanford during
fall quarter, says that he was not
even aware that the I niversitv
had an Honor (lode. Only dur
ing finals did he line! out from Ins

teaching assistant that "profes
sors were not allowed in to sta\ in
the room when students were
taking an exam."
It is one thing for professors
not to know the code, but it can
have more serious consequences
for students. Many students
brush aside this concei n. pointing
out that, at its heart, the Honor
( ode is all common sense.
