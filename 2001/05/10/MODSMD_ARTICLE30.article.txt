tunity, with McCormack and Shulman
simultaneousK leading at the stan of
both the men's and women's races.
"Regardlessof how the rest of the rate
went, that put us on the map,'' said coach
Eric Bean, who raced in the professional
category the flay before. "We had three
women tome out of the water in the top
six, then the announcer came on and

said Matt [McCormack] was leading the
men's rat eat the top of Lynch I lill a one
mile climb beginning the cycling portion
of the race. It was incredible. Matt and
Sarah are consistent in eat li of the three
disciplines, but so much can happen in
I Ok run. I was hoping tlicv would hold
on, and they both did."

At last year's Wildflower competi
tion, the club was only an idea in the
head of current senior and future
I riatlilon Club President Fiona Creig.
Competing alongside a handful of
other Stanford students, she remem
bers feeling overwhelmed by the large
college teams.
"We were a bunch of individuals with
no uniforms, only attempts at school
pride and no unity," Creig said. "This
\ear, Stanford was in full force, not only
because of our talented Stanford ath

letes, bin also because ol the tram pride
and spirit we exhibited."
I his year c< >uld n< >t have been more
diHerent," Shulman said. "Last year, 1
stood .it the start line in a mass of wet suits
and college teammates, none of whom
were mine. I his year, .is 1 stood at the
swim start, I slapped hands and veiled
< lieers with niv teammates. I had always
thought triathlon was an individual
sport until Wildflower. Bov, did last
weekend prove me wrong."
I he team has been training together
ofticialh since last fall. 1 -ist spring. (>i eig
brainstormed with coaeh Eric Bean
who took a leave of absence from Stan
ford graduate school to race profession
allyâ€” to create a structure and vision
for the team.
"We wanted to foster a hospitable en
vironment for all sorts of triathletes, re
gardless of talent or fitness," (ircig said.
"We also wanted to promote
triathlon at the collegiate level.
I riathlon has just become an (Mvnipic
sport, so the University is really the
breeding ground for future
()lvmpians," Bean said.
Bean said he hopes to see triathlon in
cluded .is an N( IAA sport in the future.

Although triathlon is relatively
young, (ireig said he was pleased with
the team's development this year.
"We had people from lots of differ
ent athletic backgrounds with an
equal number of men and women, im
dergrad and grad students," C.reig
said. "It was very easy for people to
participate at any level, even it it was
only once a week for practice."
Junioi Beckv Hopkinson. a first-year
trial hlete, agrees.
It's a great team, so supportive of dif
ferent levels," she said. "There is the
competitive aspect, or vou can just go at
it for fun. I here's a place for so many dif
ferent kinds of athletes on this team."
I lie team members say they hope to
improve its plat ing and potentially win
the title.
"We are certainly capable of winning,
dominating really," Bean said. "This was
a building year, and now I'm recruiting.
Next year, watch out!"
