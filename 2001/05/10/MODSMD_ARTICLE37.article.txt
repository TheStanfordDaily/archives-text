## Keller Williams 
### Micah Lapidus, Contributing Writer 
kellei Williams's new album, "Loop," beautifully
(luonic les the development of Ins unique music al voice.
As be wi lies on Ibe inside cover of Ins album, " I his
compilation of songs is an attempt to c apture a plia.se
that I am in. Yes, its the loop phase. I lu> recending was
< reated live on stage with the help of a phrase sampler.
When n sounds like there are two people singing or
you hear a bass line a< companying the guitar, you mav
think there has to be- more than one person on stage.
Well, there ain't, it's |usi little ole' me. What I am doing
is stepping on the trigger, pla\ ing 01 singing a line and
then at the i ight 1111 it* stepping on the it iggei again. It's
then that the rill I jusi played or s.uig loops around
continuouslv until I either stop n 01 facie n out. ()nce
the loop is ( reateel, I can layer music on top of it."
II tins e ire'iiitous description oI process sounds
interesting to you, buy the album. You will not be
disappointed.
I here are v.u ions pros and eons to Williams's "Loop
I'll.isc From the viewpoint of a singer songwriter /
acoustic guitarist, sik Ii a complete!) self--sulfic ient
process is endlessh edif) ing. In the live- setting reflected
on the album, Williams gracelulh constructs his songs,
instrument In msti unieiit. Mis myriad of musical talents
allow lot an endless vat iation of siai ting points and com
binations of different instruments.
Like a puppeteer, he brings his instruments to life,
setting them in motion one at a time. First the acoustic
guitar, then the vocall\ produced chum be.it, followed
b) bass lines, vocals, trumpet and trombone solos (also
vocal I \ produced) until an entire hand's woi th of instru

nipulate the elec tronic landscape as lie plavs. Listeners
skeptical ol the merits ol "mouth" trumpet and trom
bone can expect lo be thoroughl\ c Olivine eel and possi-

blv even pleased with Williams' reverb-infused tone.
throughout his live-album career (including
Breathe," recorded with String Cheese Incident),
Williams's success has been a result not only ol Ins novel
ty and musieality, but also ol his songwriting and lyrics.
()ne track ends with Williams quoting some worthwhile
advice.
Being written instead ol sung, the following quote
may appear cliche, but, backed by Williams's sound
scape, it captures the essence of his message. So, having
made such a disclaimer: "Work like you don't need the
money / Love like you never been hurt / Dance like no
body is watching."
If you want to hear grassroots acoustic meets
loop-based electronica, Williams's "Loop" should
Ik* on your list. 11, on the other hand, you're most
ly interested in the performed aspects of the music.

you may want to check out "Breathe," which fea
iures hoth Williams and S(II.
As Williams said, this is a phase he is passing through.
( an ions listeners inav want to see where lie's come from
first. to gain perspective on the album.
