# "Standards"
## Tortoise 
### Sarah Mearon, Editorial Staff 
Listen to the first two minutes ol "Seneca" on Tor
toise's new album, "Standards," and your head might
start spinning.
I lie opening track on the group's fourth release since
their eponymous debut in 1994 is an anthem-like eruption
of dizzying guitar and spasmodic cymbal noise. Bin tin
track soon gives way to the more familiar jazz-influenced
pert ussivc ramhlings that have made the hand a favorite of
both free jazz and indie-rock enthusiasts alike.

I Ik- ti.uk ' T'.ros" features .1 beat-defiant blip 111.11
I.teles 111 .ind out. 111 the midst <>l sometimes gurglv,
sometimes effervescent, polvrhvthmic, up-tempo per
cussive experiments. In contrast, the track titled'Ben
\va\ starts oil slow and deliberate, featuring irregular
pulsations and minimalist melancholic percussion that
teasingb st.ul to lade awa\ until .1 surge ol tic klisi 1. w lo
phonic melodies begins hlurping and dribbling with
cyclic asymmetrical rhythms.
I hough they feature similar rhythmic backbones,
T.den 1" blooms as a plasmatic , dub hiccup; whereas
"Fden 2" blasts oil like .1 beat-warping, sonic alb rever
berating journey into a space-rock universe.
"Speakeas\," a euphonious, balmv inic ro-symphony,
is a two-faced track that goes back and forth between .1
c tackling, soft-spoken whisper and .111 upbeat, rousing
rant. Like "Six Pack," a well-structured eflbrt that fea
tures an echoing, aqueous gurgling in mid-stream and is
as sunny as it is plucky, "Speakeasy" is reminisc cut of the
loungy, electronic--meets-jazz fusion of "TNT," the
band's hollo precursor to "Standards."
"Standards" is an album on which the percussive ebb
and flow is carefully manipulated in order to generate
the most satisfying interpretation of the Tortoise sound
heard to date. From the minimalist, twang\ echoes of
"Firefly" to the lusty, beat-rific cadency of "Monica,"
Tortoise has set the standard for its own alloy of indie
rock experiments.
