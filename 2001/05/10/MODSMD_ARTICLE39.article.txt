# "Trouble in Shangri-La"
## Stevie Nicks 
### Misty Espinoza, Contributing Writer 
I .1111 convinced ili.it Stevie Nicks lives on another plan
et. It's a planet that is ruled by high priestesses with crys
tals and emeralds, where the scent of incense lingers every
where, and, most importantly, it's windy. Now, you are
probahly asking yourself why I believe this. The answer is
simple: These are .ill things that she sings about on her new
album, " I rouble in Shangri-La."
If you were really bored, you could go through the
entire album and count the number of times "wind" is
mentioned in the lyrics. I venture to guess that that
number is in the double digits. But, other than Nicks's
obsession with nature, there is nothing really extraor
dinary about this album.
I was intrigued to check out this CI) at first because it
boasted that there were heavy collaborations with Sheryl
(Irow, Mac y (iray and Sarah M< Lachlan. ( Â»ray contributed
vocals to "Bombay Sapphires." Her vocals are drowned
out In those of Nicks, and, if it weren't for the liner notes,
I never would have known that Gray was even featured on

iliis album. I he same goes lor the duet, "Too Far From
Texas.' with Dixie Chirk Natalie Maines.
Love Is." Nicks's collaboration with McLachlan, defi
nitely has McLt< hi.in s signature haunting vocals, and the
track itsell is one of the album's highlights. Crow was a
major contributor on five of the album's tracks, serving as
a background vocalist, producer, songwriter and musi
cian on various songs. (Irow's assistance is definitely bene
ficial, but 1 can't help wondering if some of the songs, like
Its Only Love," would lx- better if Crow had sung them
herself.
Overall, the CD is not bad. The opening track, "Trou
ble in Shangri-La," sets the mystical, whimsical tone for the
album. Nicks sings, "I hear there's trouble in Shangri-La/
I run through the grass / I run over stones / Down to the
sea / Show me the way back, honey." Did I mention that


I haven't seen softer lighting since the last Barbara Walters special
Stevie Nicks has this thing for nature?
Some of the songs become more interesting when the
history behind ii is discovered. "That Made Me Stronger"
was written alter Nicks had a very personal conversation
with Tom Petty, during which he convinced her that she
needed to write her own music and not look to him or oth
ers. It is a strong song that captures the catharsis achieved
in th.it moment
hven though the album tends to be a bit monotonous,
standout songs like "Kvery Day"and "I Miss You" make it
.1 worthwhile listen. So burn some incense, light some can
dles and play this album while meditating.
