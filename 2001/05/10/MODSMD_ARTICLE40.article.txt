# "Born To Do It"
## Craig David 
### Marisa Taylor, Contributing Writer 
Craig David doesn't seem like the kind of guy who
likes to waste time. By age l(i, the United Kingdom na
tive was songwriting, deejaying at his lather's West Indi
an club .nul running his own underground radio show
in Southampton.
Today, at 19 years of age, David li.ts risen to teen-idol
status following the release ol his first album, "Born to
Do It." which won him four nominations for this year's
BRI T awards, including Best British Male Solo Artist
and Best British Album.
"Born to Do It" is poised for release in the United
States this summer, and it features a iiiii(|iie hybrid ol
R&B <uul garage (U.K. slang for techno) tracks, all of
which David co wrote. All this, and he still shares .ill.it
with his mother.
I lis voice is sexy, smooth and soulful, particularly
when combined with beautiful guitar background
melodies that are featured in most tracks. In "Fill Me
In"a —a song about sneaking out to hook up with the
girl next door while her parents are out — David
proves that he refuses to stick to one genre as he
switches from a slow, R&B groove to an up-tempo
techno and back again.
C) 11 the other hand. David's lyrics, though certain
ly more original than comparable U.S. acts, are quite
often sleazy and difficult to take seriously, 112 or exam
ple, in "7 days," he croons about a woman he met on
the subway, saying, "I met this gal on Monday \ took
her fora drink on I uesday \ we were making love by

Wednesday \ and on Thursday and Friday and Satur
day \ we chilled on Sunday."
Despite his one-track mind, and judging by the im
mense popularity of ben hands, it's a good het that David
will be every hit as successful m the I nited States .is he has
been in the United Kingdom. Mis songs aren't anything
proloundl) deep or poetic, but, then again, time and time
again, Top 40 acts have proven such qualities unnecessarv
for going platinum. David has a beautiful voice, and his
tunes are catchy and ver\ danceable. 8.5.8., step aside:
The British .ire coining.


"Wake me when you're through being cool, 'cause I'm
snoring."
