# "Volume 7"
## Cafe Del Mar 
### Ulrike Buschbacher, Editorial Staff 
"(:.ilc Del Mar," in the tradition <>l l»)\ bands, is sim
ply dreamy. And although it doesn't take much, it is
much better than anything the bo\ band mania will
ever produce.
dale Del Mar is actually a place in Ibi/.a, a little cafe
started in 1980, that has become the worldwide ac-

knowledged plate to watch I lie sun set ovei tilt*
Mediterranean sea. I lie CI) is the soundtrack for the
(.lie's milling < rowd ol l ie h hohnohhers drinking theii
martinis shaken, not stirred.
W illi a mix ol blues, ja/v and Knigma-csque alter
native, this compilation alhum blends togethei
smoothly. And while vou won't find yoursell rocking
out to it, "Cafe Del Mar" provides great background
ambient noise. I his is not to impl\ tli.it the album >>ini
ply lades into oblivion. I he set ies i> immensely popu
lar around the world, and big name artists like Moby,
Bed roc k and Bush signed on to contribute to this vol
ume.
Put together by resident l>| Bruno, the songs are
(liosen to rellec t the sounds ol the sea and, ultimately,
pa\ homage to the sunset tli.it makes the cale famous.
While the mellow tunes and blessed-out vibes might be
a sugar overdose for some, there are enough unique
tracks to pique the ear's attention every once in a
while. The first live songs, of 13, are the album's
strongest — a fact that has a lot to do with the fact th.it
both Moby's "Whispering Winds" and Bush's "Letting

the (iables Sleep" are included in this first batch.
The middle of the alhum .ill fades into a female voice
crooning long vowels. The last few songs of the alhum,
starting with Bent's "Swollen," pick up the beat a little
with mote of an electronica sound and thus extinguish
the threat of boredom with the album.
Overall, I>| Bruno manages to keep his esoteric and
experimental sounds and balearic bliss constant
throughout the IS tracks. Fortunately, the songs are all
rotighl\ the same quality, aside from the few gems, and
heme there isn't the need to always skip past that one
song you realh detest right in the middle of the album.
M\ guess is that you will either love this (if) or hate it.
II you enjoy albums like Karma, Knigma and Moby, this
is definitelv worth a listen.


I don't need to shave. I'm that cool
