"Venus Underground," the new CD issued
through Inunergent / Klectromatrix and produced
In Porno tor Pyros guitarist Peter DiStelano, is
atna/ing. I he release is (lie joint work ol DiStelano
on guitars, Little (ireeti ("»ii 1 on vocals and Big (ireen
Boy as programmer. It is an upbeat dance compila
tion with emotionally c harged lyrics.
I he leadofl Hack, "Back Seat," is an excellent song
that addresses sexual violence. But it is unclear

whether it is addressing assault or abuse. The lyrics
"Dirty little mind, look what you have ruined," are in
telligently woven with similar lyrics to address the im
plications ofsexuali/ing the victims of sexual violent c
through stigmali/ation and stereotyping. The sonj>
ends with a male voice saying, "You asked for it,"re
peatedh . until his voice fades out completely.
file second track is also highly socially conscious.

"Hard Young Thing" begins with traditional Indian
music and is followed with programmed music that
gives the feel of trying (<> create a sense of the primi
tive, mysterious and unknown.
I he l\ rics, "Still beda/.zles, brilliant prisons, naked
women, starving children ... celebrate the angry blind
man, set the stage lor an exploration into the deniys
tilication ol die modern world. As the song progress
es, Little (ireen Girl croons, "Hard young thing
Iv\ ice I lie 11111 and ;ill the flavor /So sad i.ill thing /Do
\ou think you are doing the world a lavor," introduc
ing .t protagonist who embodies Western realities with
the mentioning of, "Naked growling ocean water . . .
concrete pools of wasteland, celebrate the lifeless
wasteland."
I he song is a criticism of modern society,
specifically of poverty and the glorification ol the
young, which, in ways, acts to demonize and mys
tify the old.
I he (11) is ingeniously political in scope. The in
dividuals involved in making the music have used
the lyrics, mixing and track titles to support one an
other in a functional way. The talent involved in
producing it is incredible, with contributions from
such people as Kric Avery (Jane's Addiction) on bass
011 selected tracks, Kevin llaskins (Itauhaus, Love
.uid Rockets) as contributing programmer, as well
as many other great talents on select pieces. In
essence, even if you don't want to hear what the)
have to say, you can't help but feel the force of their
convictions in this project.
With its space-adventure sounds and fast-paced,
rhythmic beats, the compilation makes fora very
(lance-friendly, enjoyable (11). "Venus Under
ground" maintains high energy with unique juxta
positions of synchronized sounds and transient
punk lyrical vocal texture. Overall, "Venus Under
ground" is enjoyable dance music and is surpris
ingly t Ik night-provoking.


Do I make you horny, baby? Do I make you randy? Didn't
think so.
