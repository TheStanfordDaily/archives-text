## Silent Bob speaks: The Kevin Smith interview 
### JEB ORY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
(-hand's are that you ve seen one ol the Jet se\ (ihronicles before. Ihe " |ersey Chron
icles" is Kevin Smith s shop name for his New Jersey-set cinematic creations: "Clerks,"
Mallrals, Dogma and "Chasing Amy." Add the upcoming "|a) and Silent Bob Strike
back, scheduled to be released Aug. 10, and you have the five components to the "(chron
icles, which represent director Smith's movie prodtu ing and directing career.
I recently chatted with Smith about his film career, sandwiches and the simple so
phistication of Oral humor.

On his past
In his youth, Smith envisioned a future as a deli
owner. I didn't know anything about blue-collar work
— or white-collar work, for that matter," he said. But he
did know how to make "a heck of a sandwich." Here, as
he proclaims his love for the sandwich, Smith makes an
other reference to liis large frame, demonstrating his
ability to not take himself seriously.
Smith's assault on the media began in the early '90s,
when he was working as a comic book producer. I lis love
for comics is evident in "Arrow (aoss," his cut i ent book,
and in "(aliasing Amy," which is set around a comic book
convention.
Smith said he finds working on movies much more in
teresting than working < >11 c<>mic books because of the op
portunities that movies provide to work with hundreds of
people. Ihe creative process, which begins in Smith's
room, is transformed on the set as his ideas come to life.
I get paid to make pretend lor a living. How genius is
that?" lie said.
At 21, Smith saw "Slacker" and fell in love with cine
ma. "Slacker," a definitive cult classic, tells the story of

several likeable characters in pseudo-documentary i;isli
ion. "Clerks followed in "Slacker" 's footsteps as a low-budget, introspective look .it the in
teractions of a group of Jerseyites through the eyes of the local mini-mart stall.
"C.lerks" was filmed on the amazingly low budget of $28,000. "Dogma" and "Mallrats'
both cost several million to film, but Smith re-

turned to his low budget roots with "(.basing
Amy, whit h cost onlv $250,000.
On his sense of humor
Smith's films are all funny and fea
ture an interesting mix of lowbrow and
highbrow humor. "Dogma" is .1 prime ex
ample of this interesting mix, as it coin
bines elevated plot lines with simple, even
stupid spoken jokes. Smith describes bis
sense of humor, which be attempts to
translate to bis movies, as falling some
where between the "really smart dumb
humor" or "really dumb smart humor."
I lowever, Smith is not a fan of "gross
out" humor. "Licking ,1 tow's udder doesn't
really make me chuckle," he said. Smith's
films are more sophisticated and more clever
than other films lumped in the same "gener
ation \" genre. I lis movies are more com
plex than certain Farrelly films, such as

I here's Something About Man," and are cettainh more relmed than loin (Ireen's
"Road 1 rip" or an\ lilm from the c ollection of "Saturda\ Night Live" alumni Hicks.
I hat said, he relies on dialogue lor coinedic effect in his movies. "Very rarely is [m\
humor| visual, Smiih.said. \\ hit h means I m not verv good at visual humor, I guess."
"What's said is always more lunm to me than what's shown," he said. Smith believes
in the sain t it\ ol the "spoken joke. His alii 11 ity lor the simplistic sophistication ol oral
humor likely stems from his roots: food, comic sand low-budget movies.
On "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"
Jay and Silent Bob Sn ike Back, a big-budget, $20 million flick, is "more juvenile than
Ann iiicl ,i little smarter ili.m 'M:illi;ik ' "

/\my ,nm <i ill 11 v MlldlKl 111.11l IVI.UII .U.N,
Smith said. "Strike Back" is slated to he his last
movie based in New Jersey. Smith describes his
upcoming release as "Rosencrantz and
(inildenstern (are Dead) who are 'Waiting lor
(iodot.' But not nearly as well written, he
qualifies.
So expect more of the same type of
milkshake in "Sti ike Bat k. hut with cherries on
top. ('.berries in the form of an additional $15
million, which translates into an amazing 220
digital effects. "(Phasing Amy" had about 10 and
Dogma had 20 to .SO. "dlerks," somewhat obvi
ously, had none. Visuals for "Strike Back" were
treated by Jamie Anderson, the "Small Sol
diers' (inematographer.
Jayson Hughes, who plays )ay in
Smith's movies, vull be back and is rumored to
"finally get some." Whether this pans out — or
i> simph a plo\ by Smith to assure that sexually
repressed, pot-smoking teenagers with long
hair go to the movie — will not be determined
until the August release date. (Smith adds, how-

ever, thai the chances are "not likely." But I'll
lake those odds to get some any day of the week, huh, Stanford?)
And .is for one final juicy tidbit that Smith lans should know: Smith is Silent Boh. I It
docs double duty in his films, which lie finds exhausting. I lowcver, in real life. Smith
says the roles ol himsell and Jay are reversed: Jay is quiet in real life, and Smith is the
chatterbox.
Smith classifies his films as demonstrations of "hyper-reality." He notes that, in real life,
people usually do not go off on two-minute monologues, but, in movies, u is almost expe< t
ed. lbs characters are larger than life — exaggerated — just like the comic book characters
he creates.

Alter "Si i ike Bark," Smith will he
leaving the " |ei sey (Ihroniclcs" he
hiiul and will no longer follow the
exploits of )ay and Silent Boh.
By moving past his roots in Jay
and Boh, Smith will try to make a
lew films without the simultaneu
os "crutch and safety net" of a few
familiar characters (One project
in the works is a prequel to the
popular Chevy Chase series of
"Fletch" movies). I lis future
movies will still he somewhat au
tobiographical and will feature
other kooky characters, like Roy
and Silent Bill.


McVeigh ripped off your Death Star bit.


The man, the myth, the facial hair.


I speak in hyper-girly falsetto like a phone sex operator.

Smith's movies, vull be back and is rumored to

hair go to the movie — will not be determined
until the August release date. (Smith adds, how-

ever, thai the chances are "not likely." But I'll
lake those odds to get some any day of the week, huh, Stanford?)
And .is for one final juicy tidbit that Smith lans should know: Smith is Silent Boh. I It
docs double duty in his films, which lie finds exhausting. I lowcver, in real life. Smith
says the roles ol himsell and Jay are reversed: Jay is quiet in real life, and Smith is the
chatterbox.
Smith classifies his films as demonstrations of "hyper-reality." He notes that, in real life,
people usually do not go off on two-minute monologues, but, in movies, u is almost expe< t
ed. lbs characters are larger than life — exaggerated — just like the comic book characters
he creates.

leaving the " |ei sey (Ihroniclcs" he
hiiul and will no longer follow the
exploits of )ay and Silent Boh.
By moving past his roots in Jay
and Boh, Smith will try to make a
lew films without the simultaneu

familiar characters (One project
in the works is a prequel to the
popular Chevy Chase series of
"Fletch" movies). I lis future
movies will still he somewhat au
tobiographical and will feature
other kooky characters, like Roy
and Silent Bill.


McVeigh ripped off your Death Star bit.


The man, the myth, the facial hair.


I speak in hyper-girly falsetto like a phone sex operator.
(-hand's are that you ve seen one ol the Jet se\ (ihronicles before. Ihe " |ersey Chron
icles" is Kevin Smith s shop name for his New Jersey-set cinematic creations: "Clerks,"
Mallrals, Dogma and "Chasing Amy." Add the upcoming "|a) and Silent Bob Strike
back, scheduled to be released Aug. 10, and you have the five components to the "(chron
icles, which represent director Smith's movie prodtu ing and directing career.
I recently chatted with Smith about his film career, sandwiches and the simple so
phistication of Oral humor.

On his past
In his youth, Smith envisioned a future as a deli
owner. I didn't know anything about blue-collar work
— or white-collar work, for that matter," he said. But he
did know how to make "a heck of a sandwich." Here, as
he proclaims his love for the sandwich, Smith makes an
other reference to liis large frame, demonstrating his
ability to not take himself seriously.
Smith's assault on the media began in the early '90s,
when he was working as a comic book producer. I lis love
for comics is evident in "Arrow (aoss," his cut i ent book,
and in "(aliasing Amy," which is set around a comic book
convention.
Smith said he finds working on movies much more in
teresting than working < >11 c<>mic books because of the op
portunities that movies provide to work with hundreds of
people. Ihe creative process, which begins in Smith's
room, is transformed on the set as his ideas come to life.
I get paid to make pretend lor a living. How genius is
that?" lie said.
At 21, Smith saw "Slacker" and fell in love with cine
ma. "Slacker," a definitive cult classic, tells the story of

several likeable characters in pseudo-documentary i;isli
ion. "Clerks followed in "Slacker" 's footsteps as a low-budget, introspective look .it the in
teractions of a group of Jerseyites through the eyes of the local mini-mart stall.
"C.lerks" was filmed on the amazingly low budget of $28,000. "Dogma" and "Mallrats'
both cost several million to film, but Smith re-

turned to his low budget roots with "(.basing
Amy, whit h cost onlv $250,000.
On his sense of humor
Smith's films are all funny and fea
ture an interesting mix of lowbrow and
highbrow humor. "Dogma" is .1 prime ex
ample of this interesting mix, as it coin
bines elevated plot lines with simple, even
stupid spoken jokes. Smith describes bis
sense of humor, which be attempts to
translate to bis movies, as falling some
where between the "really smart dumb
humor" or "really dumb smart humor."
I lowever, Smith is not a fan of "gross
out" humor. "Licking ,1 tow's udder doesn't
really make me chuckle," he said. Smith's
films are more sophisticated and more clever
than other films lumped in the same "gener
ation \" genre. I lis movies are more com
plex than certain Farrelly films, such as

I here's Something About Man," and are cettainh more relmed than loin (Ireen's
"Road 1 rip" or an\ lilm from the c ollection of "Saturda\ Night Live" alumni Hicks.
I hat said, he relies on dialogue lor coinedic effect in his movies. "Very rarely is [m\
humor| visual, Smiih.said. \\ hit h means I m not verv good at visual humor, I guess."
"What's said is always more lunm to me than what's shown," he said. Smith believes
in the sain t it\ ol the "spoken joke. His alii 11 ity lor the simplistic sophistication ol oral
humor likely stems from his roots: food, comic sand low-budget movies.
On "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"
Jay and Silent Bob Sn ike Back, a big-budget, $20 million flick, is "more juvenile than

Smith said. "Strike Back" is slated to he his last
movie based in New Jersey. Smith describes his
upcoming release as "Rosencrantz and
(inildenstern (are Dead) who are 'Waiting lor

qualifies.
So expect more of the same type of
