Hi i.m llclgclancl doesn't follow the rules.
YV lien I spoke with 111111 .1 leu weeks ago in
San i- 1 .iii< is( o, lie was sporting a sling oil Ins

show Ins son how sale the backyard trampo
line was. When Ins son dared linn to |iunp

and piomplK ended up in llu- cinergenc\
loom as a result.
llclgelaud, whose credits include "I A
(ionlidenti.il. Ihe Postman and "l\iv
bac k. took what some mav judge as an
c(|ii.ill\ dangerous risk in the production ol
his new film, "A Knight's I ale," whu h opens
tomorrow. Instead ol taking an idiosMic i at
ic approach to the Medieval-set film, lie de
cided to take the road less traveled
lather, lie paved his own road .ill logethei
I lie soundtrack to the film features such
notorious rock anthems as Queen's "We
Will Rock You. W.us I,ow RicTei and S|\
it I lie I'.unilx Stone's "I Want to I ake You
I li^lu-i." I fnunni. Is it j.ii ring? Well. ves. Is

it malapropos? Perhaps not. In re
jecting the pomp and c ire unisi.iiue
th.it accompanies most period pieces, Ifel
geland has fought the moh inentalitv that
dictates that period films should he serious
and (what is perceived to he) authentic.
And I lelgeland staunc hh believes that
lie made the right creative decisions iu the
making of this film. Whether the masses
c hoose to ac cept oi reject his vision will he
quantitatively cletei mined at the hox oflice.
I hose numbers will determine whether he
li.is "iiuid on his I.ice A big disgrace" or
whether he "w ill roc k vou."
So, in your words, what is "A Knight's
Tale" about?
I think, at the end of the dav, it's a movie
about \ouih. and it's a movie about identitv
and kind ol finding voui place in the world.
And.in the process, going up a little bit
.ii^.ni ist the rules ol society, which, in a way,
is kind of a rock n roll stor\. I think, which
is win I have all that music in there. It's
hopelulK just about Irving to find vourself
and being true to vourself, whatever that
sell turns out to be, I guess.
I liked the fact that the film didn't try to be ail
epic "Gladiator."
It m.ikes it ver\ relatable to a contenipo
rar\ audience. I mean, it's part of what \oii
like about it, but its also kind of the sin of pe
riocl nun les. in that the\ make ever\ thing so
serious and so sell-important. |ust because

1 ike. we

I mi. von know. It
.i 1 v\,i\ s existed,
.ind. il von lived
in 1370, there
was music tli.it
\ou would tlmik.
" 1 hat's nn pai
ents' music,
that's not my
music, and that's
church music,
and that's music

voii (.in dame to and that's imisii von
can't danie to."
Hopefully, in a weird sort of way, 1
hoped to bring the time pel iod alive more
than it would he than it \ou would he all re
ligiously museum-like with the whole
thing, like "First Knight" or something
like tli.it. Fven a movie like "Kxralihur,"
which I really like a lot. is kind ol'relent
lessly sci ions.
Did you find it challenging to write the
dialogue so that the characters wouldn't
sound so stodgy or serious?
Yeah. At the end <>l the da v. it's about
movie dialogue, and you're lighting
movie convention, rather than histori-

(al convention. Because, in that time pe
riod. the Knglish court spoke French and
obviously the French people spoke French
.ind people speaking Knglish spoke a ver
sion that we would he hard pressed to un
derstand today. So 1 get some flak loi not
being historicalh accurate, but the reality is
that no movie ever made is historicalh ac
curate .is lar as that goes.
And, .it the same time, the danger be
comes that you turn into a museum piece
that's .ill dusty. So the ( hallenge is to ( reate
.i kind ol medieval movie dialogue that yout
ear registers and \ou believe is medieval.
but I wanted to mix in some slang and
anac In onistic phrases. I he prim ess a cou
ple times says,"wow,"and it'suot ,i mistake.
I he\ would have a word lor wow bat k then
and. il I had them sav "zounds," it would be
like, what are the\ saving? It was to try to,
.ig.tm, make it more real, make it more flesh
and blood people l>\ making them more
identifiable.
I remember when the character, Wat, says,
"Hello?" (Think Valley-speak).
Yeah, which I think is within the rules ol
Ins character that were established. You
know, people were sarcasm back then. I
nevei wanted it to be .i parodv like "Monty
Python." but, .it the same time, I rcalh like
the dram.i and I like the time period.
but I wanted to poke Inn at it a little hit,
to tease it in the way, von know, vou'd te.ise
yout brother or \oiii sistet. You still love it,
but \oii go on teasing it a little bit. get it
standing on its head a little hit, hut, In the
end of the nio\ie, it's b.u kon its leet. All this
knightly business he goes through is true to
all those movies that have ever been made
when it's all said and done.
(Lan you talk a little bit about the sound
track and what you were trying to accom
plish with it?

Jus! like I said, 1 think the spirit in rock
'11' roll is very much what the spiiit of the
movie is.
1 r.idit ionally, in .1 store, you're playing
the emotion of any given moment. I In
emotion ol the characters and music in a
movie is telling the audietu e how to feel and
so the rock songs in this are doing the same
thing.
So there are these more stadium kind ol
anthems, and 1 wouldn't know what to have
in plat e of them il I took all that musit out
and had to score it.
It would take away from what you were try
ing to do. I mean, making it something that
contemporary audiences could relate to.
Yeah.
I like that BTO (Rachman Turner Over
drive) was in there. They're from my home
town.
Are you from ('anada?
Yeah. From Winnipeg.
(iool. But " faking dare ol Business,"
through that montage — that's exaeth what
he's doing. It's perfect. I don't know what
else to put there.
Y< >u know, at the end, when they're com
ing hack from the parade and they've all
been away from home lor years and they're
pla\ing" I he Bo\ s are Back in I own," they
could write ore hesti.il stuff fora month and
never come up with anything better than
that.
And it's really just silly to sa\ that there's
llat-out no way that music can go there be
cause, I don't know il I mentioned, but the
more traditional way to go would be with an
orchestral score, and the instruments
weren't even invented in 1370. So that's as
false as anything. It's the '70s, but it's just
the 13705.


I think I'm having deja vu


I'm the embodiment of rock 'n' roll, centuries before its invention.


Don't look at me like that. You've got those crazy eyes.
