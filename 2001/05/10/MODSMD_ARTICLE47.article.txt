# 'A Knight's Tale': Getting medieval on your ass
## 
### SARAH MEARON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Okay. So 1 admit it. I like "The Karate Kid." I mean, it's
the classic hero's journey. Boy gets ass kicked. Boy vows re
venge. Boy gets ass kicked some more. Bo\ learns karate
and ends up kic king some Cobra-Kai ass — and, in the
process, wins the girl of his dreams. It's inevitable: When
Daniel heats Johnny in the finals of the All Valley karate
tournament, I c an't help hut shed a tear or two.
So when I saw "A Knight's Tale," Brian llelgeland'scoming
of-age storv about

a peasant ("The
Patriot" \s Heath
Ledger), who be
comes one of the
greatest knights of
his clay, I was pleas
antly reminded of
Daniel's journey.
Ledger is no Ralph
Macchio (sigh),
but, hey, you c an't
win them all.
The thing
about "The
Karate Kid" was
that it was made
without pretense
or conceit. It was
just a low-key film
with a low-key sto-

ryline, featuring some low key ac tors who undouhtedh col
lected some fairly low-key salaries. And, by (iod, it worked.
Like " I he Karate Kid," "A Knight's I ale" is .in under
stated attempt at the same basic storyline. William (Ledger)
is a wayward peasant who, along with his buddies Roland
(Mark Acldy) and VV.it (Alan Tudvk), discover that their
master has died — "His spirit is gone, but Ins stench re
mains" — just moments before he is set to compete in a
jousting tournament. And so begins the hero's journey.
Because .1 win in the tournament would assure that the
bumbling threesome will have some c urrencA to trade for
food. William dec ides to in-

vent the identity ola knight,
Sir I lric li ol (ielderland, in
order to be eligible to coin
pete. Miraculously, he turns
out to have a gilt lor the
sport and ends up taking
home the top prize in the
tourney, which, lor all inten
sive purposes, is basically .1
Medieval version of the
WYVF's "Smackdown."
Unwilling to settle for one
ineasely win, the boys decide
to keep up the charade and
therefore join the jousting
circuit, competing in tout na
mentsall over F.ngland. With
the help ol his stooge like
friends, as well as Chaucer
(Paul Bettany), an un-

c lothed, unemployed
writer who they meet
along the way, and Kate
(Laura Fraser), an ar
morer blessed with altru
istic feminist ideals,
William stalls to become
somewhat of a legend.
Ralph Macc hio, eat your
heart out.
But, like an electrical
engineei ing graduate stu
dent with a soc lal life, the
Medieval setting ol the
story and the classic roc k
soundtrack that accompa
nies it |iist don't go togeth
er. (-lassie anthems like
"You Shook Me All Night
Long" and "We Are I lie
Champions" propel the
characteis through train-

ing sequences, dance scenes and victory parades.
Hie soundtrack, coupled with a one-dimensional antagonist
(Rufus Sewell) whose mincing diaglogue includes such getus as,
"He who strives to touch a star often stumbles," a thinly veiled
poke at William, eclipse what is generally a decent story.
I hroughoiit the film, William's strategy is to speak softly
and earn a big stick. Perhaps I lelgcland should have c at
ried a larger editing pen.


Did you hear that one about the actors who killed their careers?


Did they really bump and grind in
the 13705?
