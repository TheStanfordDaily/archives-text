# Blood, sex and gore eat away at this B-horror flick

### RANDY MANO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On the way home from
viewing "The Forsaken," 1
heard Cold IMay's hit song,
"Yellow," which seemed to
lit the mess I had just seen.
I he lyric, "For yon 1 bleed
myself dry," reminded me
<>l the bloody, gory sex that
vampires apparently have.
1 hey are sort of hitman,
after all. "The Forsaken"
doesn't come close to elevat
ing above the horror genre,
settling for pretty faces
spewing out empty com
ments in between explicit
vampire-human battles.
I knew this would not be a
sickeningly "PC'/' Miramax
affair (think "Chocolat" or
"The Cider House Rules")
when the first image of the
film was a blood-soaked
woman showering and bar
ing herself for the audience
to see. From there, the at
tempted story follows Sean
(Kerr Smith) as he tries to
find a way to get to his sis
ter's wedding in Florida.
The California dude luckily
scores a vintage Mercedes
â€¢450 convertible, which he
agrees to drive cross-coun
try and drop ofl in Florida

lor the owner.
Along the way, he picks up a hitch
hiker, against the wishes of the owner.
You'd think he would know better, hut,
as it turns out, this random guy he
picks up might be of use. You see, Nick
(Brendan Fehr) is a traveling pharma
cist and vampire hunter, and he turns
on his nurturing mode once Sean is ac
cidentally infected by the blood-suc k
ing Megan (Isabella Miko), a girl Nick
had rescued after she was left for dead
by a gang of vampires.
Apparently, the only way to re
verse this malady is to kill the source.
In this case, they are focusing their at
tention on Kit (johnathon Schaech), a
"forsaken" vampire roaming the

Earth since
the days ol
the Cru
sades. Ile s
surrounded
hinisell with
a couple ol
beaut i In I
sirens and .1
day-d river.
It's a won
derful lile!

Ca rd o 11 e,
"The For
saken" is a
h -grade
lil in that

has a driving soundtrack and detent
cinematography. 1 lie dry and bar
ren desert perfectly mirrors the col
lective of the characters and
helped create a sense of" isolation
and desperation.
Horror movies like "Urban Legend"
and "1 Still Know What You Did Last
Summer" are probably not meant to be
taken seriously. But I only wish there
would be some quality dialogue or ac
tion in such a film. Is that asking too
much? Unfortunately, "The Forsaken"
didn't come through in this regard, and
the film basically sucks ... in more ways
than one.
