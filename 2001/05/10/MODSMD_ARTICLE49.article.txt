# "The Mummy Returns" to fumble under lavish effects

### RAMIN SETOODEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I am not a cruel person. Really, I'm
not. fwo weeks ago, I went to see "brid
ge I |ones's Diary" and smiled and
laughed and just felt good about the
world. It was cheeky, charming Inn: a
rare treasure.

Now I've been
asked to review " I he
Mummy Returns."
I he task. I reason, is
hevond my grasp.

lie's married now to Kveh n (Rachel
VVeisz), the British gal who hail some

sheepish (harm in the first "Mummy"
movie. Here, they kiss after every action
sequence.
Why? I don't know. Perhaps writer / di
re< lor Stephen Summers thought it clever
to hose down his script with smooching
scenes that'll distract us from noticing that
the story lias holes, loose ends and strange

subplots, lint nevei mind. All I II sa\ is

I lie onl\ noticeable addition smie the
original "Muminv" is Alex (Freddie

(loath), Rick and fvelyn's 8-year-old son.
I le is annoying, whines a whole lot and has
a British accent that I could not entirely
understand. On the front page of my
notes, I wrote: "Stutters the word 'but' like
Porky pig." On page three: "As stupid .is
Klmer fudd." By the time we got to the
closing credits, I was hoping for the vil
lains to win out — just so that they could
put the kid out of his misery.
()h, and there is one more, perhaps not
so noticeable addition. It's The Scorpion
King, played by the WWf's The Rock.
However, lie's not so noticeable because
well, lie's not really in the movie. I'd
clock Ins performance at 1 1 minutes
tops, fhen again, I could be wrong; I
spent more time looking at niv wati li than
at the screen.
Shall I mention that the dialogue is
clunky (fi as-

()r that at

one point Rick actually runs faster than
the sun? Yes, that big ball of helium that
the Earth rotates around. Something tells
me Rick should have tried out for his high
school track team.
But, alas — a movie like "The Mummy
Returns" should not be thought about. It
should not be analyzed. It's intended as
mindless entertainment.
Younger teenagers, boys in particular,
might like some ol the action sequences. It's
certainly loud, with a lot of bugs and a final
battle scene that's reasonably tolerable. But
it never conies together. It's mindless all
right — but, when it comes to entertain
ment value, "The Mummy Returns" ends
up dead.


Doesn'l Brendan Fraser look a little like Ash?



All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up: THIS ... is my BOOM STICK!"
