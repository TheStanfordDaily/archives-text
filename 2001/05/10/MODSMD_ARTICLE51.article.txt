# An introduction to the bizarre alternate-reality of "Discworld"
## 
### EALASAID A. HAAS 
lorry Pratchett, author of the in
ternationally famous Discworld Se
ries, will be making several appear
ances around the Bay Area today and
tomorrow to promote his newest
hook, " fhe I hiel ol Time."
Pratchett will be appearing at
Booksmith in San Francisco today
.it 7 p.m. to sign books and answer
questions and tomorrow at both Fu
ture Fantasy in Palo Alto (1 p.m.)
and Cody's Bookselleis in Berkeley
(7:30 p.m.).
Although Prate'hett published his
first work of fiction .it age 13, his fic
tion wt iting didn't really take oil until
the Discworld series began in 1983
with "The Color of Magic" (or, as it's
known in Pratchett's native United
Kingdom, "The Colour of Magic").
Now, there are 12(> books chronicling
the adventures of a wide variety of

characters on the fantasx world, whit h
is flat like a pi/./.a and tarried through
space on the backs ol lour elephants
who are standing on a giant turtle.
It's not surprising that a world like
that is filled with improbable occur
rences and a lot of magic What in sur
prising is that these fantas\ novels are
not only hilat ioush funin but tout h
ing and well written, too.
Pratchett has often been, .is he puts
it, "accused of literature," with stu
dents of literature writing serious pa
pers about his books and Fnglish
teachers using them in (lass, lint
when one considers that his novels
deal with issues like alcoholism, the
nature of religion and the difficulties
of dealing with one's family, it begins
to make more sense.
Kven better, his books are funnv.
Ilie eccentric humor that courses
through the novels stems as much
from a kind of intellectual "ha-ha!" as

from pratfalls. For even surface joke,
there are at least two tongue-in-cheek
i eferenc es to something obsc me. And
so. in the same book, you gel a won
derful parody of the Dirty Ham "are
v.i feeling luckvr" spee< li and a pass
ing reference to the inventor of the
modern aircraft jet engine.
Plus, of course, there are elements
in the stories that are clearly the result
of some ver\ twisted but ven logical
thinking about a particular subject.
I lie ruler ol one c it\ on the Disc has

soluble premium and then not have to worry about being
robbed.
I be newest book, "The 1 hiel ol Time," lot uses on
the nature of time on the Disc . Ii follows Lu F/e, one
ofthe "history monks," as he and his apprentice try to
keep a group ol mysterious figures from stopping
time. Supporting characters include the "Fifth I lorse
man ol the Apocalypse" (the one who left before they
became famous).
One ofthe good things about the books is that
you don't have to read them in order to enjoy them.
You can pick up the 20th or the first and still know
pretty much everything you need to.
Although there is a loose chronological order to the
books, it is not strict, and many people prefer to group
them according to the characters at the center of the sto

i it's. I here are, lor example, several books about the
city watt li id one ol the largest urban areas on the Dis<
.ind several others lot using on a trio of witches in a rural
kingdom.
Death is one of the more popular characters in
the set ies, no doubt in part because be has at least a
cameo appcarance in almost every book. Rather
confused by humans, but trying to understand
them, he goes through phases ol trying to be amus
ing when making prolessional visits and has built a
bouse — complete with a garden — in his realm. I le
even lias an adopted daughter and takes a mortal ap
prentice at one point.
In another case ol I'ratchelt logic, Death rides a real
horse because skeletal ones tended to I.ill apart and ll.lin
ing steeds set lire to their stables.
The books have spawned a rich Internet culture
(see www.lspace.org lor a guide) and a worldwide net
work of fans, as well as adaptations in a variety of
media (from stage plays to an animated feature) and a
series of figurines. People seem to be drawn to the
books Ibr a variety of reasons, ranging from the
humor to the sheer quality of the writing.

Whatever the reason,
I'ratchett's books are simul
taneously ilu- focus of mas
sive adoration and surpris
ingly are little known in the
United States.
