# An introduction to the bizarre alternate-reality of "Discworld"
## 
### EALASAID A. HAAS 
lorry Pratchett, author of the in
ternationally famous Discworld Se
ries, will be making several appear
ances around the Bay Area today and
tomorrow to promote his newest
hook, " fhe I hiel ol Time."
Pratchett will be appearing at
Booksmith in San Francisco today
.it 7 p.m. to sign books and answer
questions and tomorrow at both Fu
ture Fantasy in Palo Alto (1 p.m.)
and Cody's Bookselleis in Berkeley
(7:30 p.m.).
Although Prate'hett published his
first work of fiction .it age 13, his fic
tion wt iting didn't really take oil until
the Discworld series began in 1983
with "The Color of Magic" (or, as it's
known in Pratchett's native United
Kingdom, "The Colour of Magic").
Now, there are 12(> books chronicling
the adventures of a wide variety of

characters on the fantasx world, whit h
is flat like a pi/./.a and tarried through
space on the backs ol lour elephants
who are standing on a giant turtle.
It's not surprising that a world like
that is filled with improbable occur
rences and a lot of magic What in sur
prising is that these fantas\ novels are
not only hilat ioush funin but tout h
ing and well written, too.
Pratchett has often been, .is he puts
it, "accused of literature," with stu
dents of literature writing serious pa
pers about his books and Fnglish
teachers using them in (lass, lint
when one considers that his novels
deal with issues like alcoholism, the
nature of religion and the difficulties
of dealing with one's family, it begins
to make more sense.
Kven better, his books are funnv.
Ilie eccentric humor that courses
through the novels stems as much
from a kind of intellectual "ha-ha!" as

from pratfalls. For even surface joke,
there are at least two tongue-in-cheek
i eferenc es to something obsc me. And
so. in the same book, you gel a won
derful parody of the Dirty Ham "are
v.i feeling luckvr" spee< li and a pass
ing reference to the inventor of the
modern aircraft jet engine.
Plus, of course, there are elements
in the stories that are clearly the result
of some ver\ twisted but ven logical
thinking about a particular subject.
I lie ruler ol one c it\ on the Disc has
legalized the I hieves' Cuild, reason
ing that, because < i inie is alwa\ s with
us, it might as well be organized
crime. ()l course, there are set levels of
crime and a lie ensing system, but it all
works well, l he decision is applaud

leverage over the guild, and also be
