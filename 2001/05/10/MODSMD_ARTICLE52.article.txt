# Ramin's Reel Deal
## Are trailers ruining the suspense? 
### RAMIN SETOODEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Slick with me on this one — I do luvc .1
point.
Here are .1 few lines from the theatrical
trailer to the new thriller "Angel Kves,"
which opens on Ma\ IS .11 it 1 stars |ennilei
Lope/, and Jim (lavie/el.
First, Lope/., who plays a cop, says,
"You never said a wot <1 about voursell the
other night."
I hen, Lope/., the (op-turned-lover, savs,
"Am I not going to know anything about
you? I need the details."
And C !avie/el, her lover, just stands silent
ly 111 a dai k black oven o.il.
I hen. Lope/s partner, the other cop,
says, "You realize jhe doesn't | show up in
any database. I Its .1 ghost."
Still with me? Cood. M\ point is just
around the corner.
In just about three minutes, we — the un
suspecting audience —r learn a whole lot
about the story line lor "Angel Kyes." far too
much, if you ask me.
We learn th.it Lope/ is a cop. We learn
that she saves Caviezel's life because we see
her hovering over his body, saving, ."St,i\
with me," as he's rolled into an ambulance.

I le then saves her life.
I lien things get really carried away.
We learn that Lope/ and Caviezel be
come lovers, wliic h is line. I here's ,1 lot of
eerie "Sixth Sense "-type music as we see
Caviezel, dressed in black, walking
through dark alleys alone. And Lope/,
who's confused and scared, starts cjues
tioning bis past. And finally — well, you
read it yourself — there's the line about
liini being a ghost.
I I ere, at last, comes mv point: Should we
realh know these things about the movie? I
have not seen "Angel Kyes." But surely now
1 do not know il there is a reason to. |udgiug
from the theatrical trailer, either: a) the ob
vious: (laviezel's character is a ghost, or b)
the kinduva-sortuva obvious: Both (iaviezel
and I ope/ s characters are ghosts.
I ake your pick. But does i( matter?
I he lac t that I even attempt to disassem
ble the trailer into tiny parts proves that
Warnei Brothers decided to show too
much. I he same thing happened last |uly,
when "What Lies Beneath" hit theaters. We
all knew th.it Michelle IMeifler was being
haunted b\ Harrison lord's former lover,
but we weren't supposed to. Il wasn't some
thing the movie revealed until the bottom of
the ninth.
I he same went lor "Last Awav," which lui
the multiplexes last Christmas (and "links"
last Sunday). In that theatrical trailer, we got
all the goods. We saw loin I lanks make it off
the island, reunite with I lelcn I hint and share
a weepy farewell in the rain.
Both "Cast Away" and "What Lies Be
neath" were good movies, with good story
lines and good performances. But, I must
ask myself: Wouldn't they be much better if

I walked into the the
ater with sonic hint of
surprise? 1 should think
so.
I lit- hist trailers give
a little taste of the
movie, just to reel in the
audience. Ihe trailer
for "A.1.,' for example,
onl\ shows Haley Joel
Osinent's silhouette
against a black hac k
ground. There are no
actual scenes from the
movie: We only get a
small taste.
"Angel Kyes," on the
other hand, gives lis the
entire Siz/.ler bullet he
lore we even purchase
our ticket. It's smarmy,
cheap advertising:
I hey're trying to get us
into the seat by showing
us all the suspenseful
scenes — even if that
ruins the ending.
Kut, it worked for
both "What Lies Be
neath" and "(last
Away," which raked in
tin- receipts at the box
office. And if it works
for "Angel Kyes," look
for studios to show
more in the theatrical
trailers and leave less
to surprise.
Now that's a dark
"Angel," indeed.



I can't think of a poster idea. Let's just blow up a photo of J-Lo
and go get some lunch.
