1944
On Mav 11, 1944, The Daily printed an article
about etiquette in the army.
"A glimpse into the strict training in good manners
and etiquette that the Army is giving its women sol
diers is ottered by Private Fllen (1. Fetter, now on duty
at Air-WA( 1 recruiting headquarters in I'alo Alto.
"The American public as a whole is unaware of
the instruction given to the \VA( â€” instruction that
will insure the nations respect and admiration for its
women's army.
"Number one, the \VA(. is taught that she is a
public servant, and as such she must respect the
community's social customs.
"While traveling, a WAC. must help < ivilian moth
ers with their babies, and on c rowded busses she must
offer her seat to older women and the infirm."
Bottom line: A lesson in old-fashioned etiquette probably
wouldn't hurt any of us.
