While Bay Area housing prices are
falling from record highs sei last vear, af
fordable housing is still inaccessible for
many who need it, according to the newly
formed student group Stanford Afford
able Housing Coalition.
The coalition held its first general meet
ing yesterday afternoon in the Haas ('.en
ter for Public Service. I'he meeting drew a
handful of students.
The coalition's charge — "to keep the
Stanford community abreast of local hous
ing issues and to take effective action
against the current housing crisis" — is one
that calls for several distinct approaches.
"We have the whole spectrum, from di
rect service, to research, to activism," co
founder Anamaria Nino-Murcia, a sopho
more, said.
While the group has only recentl\ been
founded, Nino-Murcia and co-founders
sophomore Christie Brawner, freshman
Katie ('.ameron and senior .Andrew (Iheng
have two projects 011 the coalition's docket.
They include creating the "Stanford 112 lous
ing, Poverty and Hoinelessness" Website,
which will cany news on local housing is
sues and link visitors to a direc tory of stu
dent groups and organizations addressing
such issues.

"We recognized that we were going to
have to work with several other groups be
cause our interests were so interrelated,"
Cameron said.
Student organizers plan to collaborate
with members of Stanford Night Out
reach, Stanford 1 >1 Action Coalition
and Students for Environmental Ac tion at
Stanford, l ogether, thev plan to organize
teach-ins and invite guest speakers to edu
cate the Stanford community.
In the future, the affordable housing
coalition plans to collaborate with the
I lousing Leadership Counc il of San Mateo
to c reate a c learinghouse Web site connec t
ing all local groups working on housing-re
lated issues.
1 lie coalition is working with Prof. Al
bert ('.amarilloof the (lomparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity Department to lav
the foundation research that will help the
group educ ate others on housing-related
issues.
"Above all. we want this to be a project
based group," Nino-Murcia said. "We
want your energy and interests to be fun
neled into projects."
While the group is seeking discre
tionary funding from the ASM so that it
mav cover transportation and publicity
costs, Brawner sa\s that the coalition's pro
jects do not require much 112 unding at all.
