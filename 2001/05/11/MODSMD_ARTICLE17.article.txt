Published Since IH9I

MORK MIAN HO,(MM) people are
expected to attend the annual
Stanford Powwow, which opens
today. The powwow — the
largest student-run event on campus and the
tilth largest in the nation — aims to bring to
gether people <>! .ill backgrounds to celebrate
Native American culture, heritage and historv.
Now in iis 30th vear, the powwow lias contin
ued its ambitious mission of promoting soli
darity between diverse Native American com
munities, raising awareness of issues laced In
the diHerein groups and providing a training
ground for student leaders. VVecoininend the
powwow organizers and the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization for continuing an
important tradition, and we believe tliev pro
vide an invaluable opportunity for everyone
in the Stanford community.
Since its inception in I ( .)71, the powwow has
held competitions lor Native American dance
and drum pet formance groups. The powwow

is, sadly, one of the relatively few venues for
appreciating the unique artistry and rich his
tory of Native-American dance and song. This
year, the dance competition includes cate
gories for men — traditional, straight, grass
and fancy — and women — northern tradi
tional, southern traditional, jingle and fancy.
Non-native participants can observe the per
formances and see for themselves the diversi
ty of Native American culture. Qualified
judges award prizes based on style and tech
nique, and the competitions themselves act as
powerful reminders of the endurance of Na
tive American culture.
hut the contests serve other important goals
as well, because the powwow draws contes
tants from so many different tribes, the event
provides a valuable opportunity for Native
Americans to network and learn from each
other. (.iven the pressing issues faced by many
tribes — including dwindling membership, al
coholism and conditions on reservations —

representatives from different groups would
do well to begin dialogues on how to deal with
common problems. Native Americans are one
of the smallest ethnic groups in the nation, and
we applaud powwow organizers for bringing
so many different groups together.
As minorities in the United States, Native
American students are also a tiny percentage of
the Stanford population. Currently, the Uni
versity has about 200 native students and two
faculty members, Prof. Matthew Snipp in soci
ology and Assoc. Prof. Teresa LaFromboise in
education. Many students grew upon reserva
tions and are not from California. They say
that being away from their homes and families
is often the most difficult part of their Stanford
experience. 1 he powwow is one way of bring
ing their communities to Stanford, and despite
their small numbers, students have been able
to plan one of the most well-organized and
popular events on campus. Much of the suc
cess of tlit* powwow comes from the ability and

desire of the organizers to reach out beyond
their own community.
If only Native American students attended
the powwow, sheer numbers would predict
that the event would not draw a very substan
tial crowd. Powwow planners recognize this
situation and have embraced the opportunity
to invite participation by people in the larger
Stanford community. Throughout the year,
organizers have visited dormitories and house
meetings to raise funding for and awareness of
the powwow. Their outreach and education ef
forts are among the most visible on campus
and merit applause.
Year after year, the powwow has wowed
Stanford students, faculty and staff with its mis
sion, spectacle and opportunity for cultural en
richment. This year should be no exception.
We congratulate the powwow staff for their ex
tensive planning and encourage all students,
regardless of background, to attend one of the
most anticipated campus events this year.
