## Coping with the numbers 
### 
Let's tart* it: Draw represents
hum li more than just a number.
Somehow one's number be
comes the embodiment ol one s
social status. On Wednesday, people with
low numbers seemed to prance up and
(town the hallways with an air ol confi
dence, always finding some wa\ to bring
up the I)raw and then i espet live low 11 um
bel . ()thers, who drew in the middle, wan
dered around aimlessly, not sure what to
make of the situation. I hev were forced to

laying ol it to inv drawinates, the "ran
domly" assigned figure— 1,2H8 — be
came definitive of me. At Stanford we
have associated one's Draw number with
one's morality. Congratulatory state
ments are made to the "deserving" low
number i ei ipients while ( vni< al whisper
ings like "how did th.it idiot |ohn get such
.1 low number?" are made by others.
Mavbc that's why this Draw thing is
such <i big deal — the number not only
determines housing but also exists as an
indicatoi of self-worth aiid goodness.
People who draw well desei ve it, (iod was
on tlieii side, they've worked harder than
the majority and subsequently are
blessed with the right to enjoy premiere
housing. ()thers feel ashamed and inade
quate with their high Draw number and
unfoi tunatch suffer the conseijuences of
their ill will.
l urther, let us consider the deeper
psvcliologic.il ramifications of housing at
Stanford. Several studies have shown
that there exists .1 direct correlation be
tween one's living environment and his
or her a< adcmic performance. Plus leads
us to the inevitable question: Are stu
dents who draw low numbers afforded
better opportunities to succeed? I must
honcsth sav that I did feel slightly less
confident after receiving my middle
number. Sitting in I-Huin section I felt
an overwhelming sense of self-conscious
ness— 1 didn't dare speak for fear that
my newly degraded state of being would
reveal itsell to my fellow classmates, al
lowing them to render unfair judgments
about my character.
I'm not quite sure how this lottery sys
tem has transformed from a luck-orient
ed process to one of defining virtue. But
when I'm sitting in my Wilbur double
next year, remember — you're no better
than I am.

Draw and the undue stress the svstem
fosters by forcing students to "choose"
friends and breed enemies. The Draw
turns Standard into a "hostile" environ

one-room quads (uncomfortable, but lo
< ated on the Row, a premiere location for
