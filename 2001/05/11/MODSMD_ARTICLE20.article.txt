Stanford Kyoto Now presents
open letter to Hennessy
Editor's note: Tins letter wis originally submit
ted as an often letter to University President John
Hennessy on Wednesday, May 9.
We, the Stanford chapter of Kyoto Now.
hope to convince you that Stanford c an and
should become a leader in the effort to curtail
global climate change. The growing scientif
ic consensus, based in part on research done
by Stanford's own faculty, confirms that
human activities are altering the earth's cli
mate and that the biological, social and eco
nomic consequences may be dramatic.
As current political debate suggests that
the country as a whole is not ready to accept
existing international efforts to limit emis
sions of greenhouse gases, let alone take the
necessary steps to fully address the issue, we
believe that individual agents, like Stanford,
can lead the way by reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
Io this end, we propose two steps Stan
ford could take toward reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. First, that the administration
orders an inventory of all of Stanford's
greenhouse gas emissions by the Energy
Management Group. This will catalog Stan
ford's greenhouse gas emissions and provide
a starting point for current and future emis
sions reduction. Second, that the University
develop a plan to begin reducinggreenhou.se
gas emissions. A sensible first step would Ix- to
commit to reduce emissions by seven percent
below 1990 levels and draft a plan [to] carry
it out. This reduction would not eliminate

Stanford's contribution to climate change,
but it would constitute a significant and
tractable step toward emissions reduction.
In addition to the leadership role that
Stanford would be taking in sensibly protect
ing the planet's climate system, we believe
such emissions reduction could also confer a
direct economic benefit to the University.
Sustainable building experts estimate th.it
Stanford buildings could be made 30 to 50
percent more energy efficient than current
Title 24 regulations require using affordable
technologies currently available. Such gains
could be achieved within the existing budget
allocations for construction through minor
changes to the existing current protocol for
hiring building teams. These buildings
would substantially reduce expenditures on
energy and save the University money for
the lifetime of the buildings.
Furthermore, California has already
passed a bill (SB 1771) to create a "Climate
Action Registry in which companies and or
ganizations can record voluntary green
house gas emission reductions. Action now
would preempt future state government
mandates to inventory emissions and reduce
potential compliance costs.
In sum, financial, public relations and
leadership rationale warrant consideration
of an emissions reduction policy. Taking ac
tion to reduce Stanford's emissions has gar
nered considerable support from the Stan
ford student body and faculty. In December,
dozens of faculty members signed a letter in
support of actions to reduce energy con
sumption by building sustainably. In March,
the Undergraduate Senate of the ASSU

passed .1 resolution tli.it supported actions by
the University "in reducing energy con
sumption ,ind greenhouse gas emissions."
That same month, the Graduate Student
Council submitted a letter to Board of
I rustees Chair Isaac Stein supporting poli
cies that would "reduce energy costs and
greenhouse gas emissions." The CSC wrote
that such actions are "in the best interest of
the University, and in the best interest of the
graduate student population."
Clearly, there exists substantial backing
from students and faculty for University ac
tion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We
encourage you to act now.
