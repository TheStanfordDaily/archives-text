# Savoyards present spring operetta
## 
### NIKI WILSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If students are too impatient to wait for the
Gal-bashing fun of Gaieties in the distant fall,
they just might find an equally satisfying laugh in
"Ruddigore" and its satire of Victorian society.
Today and tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Stanford Savo
yards present the last two performances of the
2001 season's spring operetta, Gilbert and Sul
livan's "Ruddigore." I he show opened last Fri
day night.
I his hasn't been the Savoyards' first pro
duction of "Ruddigore" and, the- group collec -
lively insists, neither is it their last. For 28 years,
the Savoyards have been bringing Gilbert and
Sullivan operettas to I )inkelspiel twice a vear, as
well as to a few other locales around the Stan
ford community. C lurrentlv, thev are wrapping
up their 04th production.
Although they revolve around Gilbert and
Sullivan musicals, the Savoyards have also
clone operettas by (Mfenbac It. Mozart, I .ort/ing
and Auber.
I he group was organized in 1973 bv stu
dents in the Music Department who were in
terested in starting a Gilbert and Sullivan
company modeled after the one at Cornell
University.
Rita I aylor, the production adviser for
"Ruddigore", joined shortlv afterwards to
work with the Savoyards' second show, "Pa
tience", and cventnallv held positions ranging
from procluc er to stage director.
"I've made costumes, reunited orchestra
and even washed the [old Memorial Auditori
um] curtain, which we bought for $ 1.05 in 1074
. . . We used it to make capes (as props] for
lolanthe ," I aylor reminisced.
Indeed, there is much historv to the Savo
yards, espec iallv looking at then penc haul fora
motley cast comprised of students, alumni, fac -
ulty and members of the surrounding commu
nities. I his connection to the community is also

embodied in Savoyards shows for senior citizen
centers, schools, conferences and scout troops.
I'aylor herself is the wife of a Nobel Prize
winning physicist at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator (lenter.
In past productions of "Ruddigore", the
Savoyards have cast provosts, athletic directors,
Nobel prize laureates and even former Univer
sity president Ric hard Lyman, in the tradition of
incorporating "eminent faculty members [into
the show] as ghostly ancestors," saicl Taylor.
I his spring, faces to note are Charles Boni

Business, F.meritus, and Phvsics Nobel Laure
ate Douglas (Jsheroff. ()n the other end of the
spec trum is freshman Kelly Parker, who plays
Dame Hannah opposite Bob Bergman, a for
mer lawyer in Palo Alto, as Sir Roderic.
"With each rehearsal, I am breaking the
'Stanford bubble' . . . interac ting with people
in the real world, with jobs and wives, hus
bands. children . . . [and] grandchildren,"
Parker saicl. "It's pretty neat."
I Ins relatively heterogeneous theater expe
rience lias left Parker considering continued
involvement in opera, looking up to Megan
Beltt an, who is now a professional opera singer
and plavs Rose Maybud in the operetta.
I he operetta follows two brothers, who are
F.nglish baronets, as they try to defeat an ap
parent family i urse. Plenty of confusion in love
and power ultimately satirizes their aristocratic
virtue, especially as the Baronet Robin calls
upon his ancestors, but reconsiders their au
thority and the reasons behind their deaths.
As 11 s11.11 for the spring production, which is
t\ | >i< ally a larger endeavor than the fall show,
the Savoyards Board of I)irectors started orga
nizing Ruddigore in 1 )ecetnber. choosing di
rectors and production staff. Auditions were
held in January, and rehearsals spanned the
rest of winter quartet and the month of April.
Board President Alice Leung, a senior, esti
mates that for any given show, the Savoyards
combine the efforts of NO to 100 people — staff.

crew, cast and orchestra. The 12 students on
the Board of Directors make executive deci
sions about shows and their staffs and also pub
licize the group and its productions.
With one weekend of shows behind him,
"Ruddigore" producer Joshua Solomin, Class
of 2000, said that while "some Gilbert and Sul
livan shows can be a little bit difficult to get, the
director did a great job putting together a show
that highlights the funny parts and doesn't ob
scure any of the plot.'
Solomin explained that as "a really funny
satire of the Victorian melodrama," the op
eretta plays with stereotypes of American evil
bankers and endangered heroines and their
analogues in England: the evil aristocrat, the
"prim and proper" maiden and the requisite
haunted castles.
Ruddigore' kind of ties together — and
makes .1 little extreme — all of these pieces,"
said Solomin. "The result is pretty hilarious."
After seeing last weekend's show, sopho
more Bienna Henn was impressed with the
costumes and the performances by the male
leads. She "immensely enjov[ed] the lyrics,
even if the plot, 11111, stinks... It was good fun."
Parker, whose involvement in the Savoyards
began with an earlier interest in Gilbert and
Sullivan, enjoys performing the "operatic
music that takes itself lightly, [and in which]
one t an decipher the words and plot."
The Savoyards pi.lll to present "The Mika
do' and " l lie Gondoliers'' during the 2001-
2002 season. 111 the future, Taylor hopes to see
"more student involvement [in the group] . ..
especially in the areas of directing and set/cos
tume design,'' so it can continue to be well rep
resented as an ASSU performing group.
Tickets to tonight's and Saturday's shows of
"Ruddigore' are available through the Stan
ford Ticket ()fficeorat the door; call 725-ARTS
for information or to purchase tickets. Tickets
cost $0.50 for students, $10 for seniors and $15

If students are too impatient to wait for the
Gal-bashing fun of Gaieties in the distant fall,
they just might find an equally satisfying laugh in
"Ruddigore" and its satire of Victorian society.
Today and tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Stanford Savo
yards present the last two performances of the
2001 season's spring operetta, Gilbert and Sul
livan's "Ruddigore." I he show opened last Fri
day night.
I his hasn't been the Savoyards' first pro

the Savoyards have been bringing Gilbert and

well as to a few other locales around the Stan
ford community. C lurrentlv, thev are wrapping
up their 04th production.
Although they revolve around Gilbert and

clone operettas by (Mfenbac It. Mozart, I .ort/ing

company modeled after the one at Cornell

Rita I aylor, the production adviser for
"Ruddigore", joined shortlv afterwards to
work with the Savoyards' second show, "Pa
tience", and cventnallv held positions ranging
from procluc er to stage director.
"I've made costumes, reunited orchestra
and even washed the [old Memorial Auditori

. . . We used it to make capes (as props] for

With one weekend of shows behind him,
"Ruddigore" producer Joshua Solomin, Class
of 2000, said that while "some Gilbert and Sul
livan shows can be a little bit difficult to get, the
director did a great job putting together a show
that highlights the funny parts and doesn't ob
scure any of the plot.'
Solomin explained that as "a really funny
satire of the Victorian melodrama," the op
eretta plays with stereotypes of American evil
bankers and endangered heroines and their
analogues in England: the evil aristocrat, the
"prim and proper" maiden and the requisite
haunted castles.
Ruddigore' kind of ties together — and
makes .1 little extreme — all of these pieces,"
said Solomin. "The result is pretty hilarious."
