Carl Flink < anic lo Stanford Iwo vears ago
lo attend law s< hool, but one of the first areas
Ik- investigated upon his arrival vv.is one quite
unrelated: Stanford's Dance Division.
"As soon as (.at I arrived on campnsa couple
veat s ago. lie knocked on inv door to ask about
joining the Vintage Dance Fnsemble," s.iid
Stanford I )ance I listorian Richard Powers.
According to Powers, Mink brings to his
dancing .1 wealth of experience as a profes
sional with the Jose Limon Daiu e Companv in
Via 11 halt. 111, one of the premier modern dance*
groups in the I .S.
I o Flink, dance is no less serious than law.
Working under commission from the dance
division, he < horeographed a dance for this
weekend's Spring Migration, Stanford
I >.iih e I )ivision's concert. I lis dance portrays
the frenetic pace of life in the Bay Area and
Silicon Valley.
In the middle of choreographing Ins piece,
he announced that he was scrapping the
danc c.
'We're (hopping this idea," he told his
d.meets, " and this is why."
W hen Flink and his wife moved here from
Manhattan three vears ago, they expected to
leave big-c it) stress levels behind. YVliat thev
found was something different.
"Fverybody's trying to be laid back, but
thev're not really," he said, likening the dot
com boom to another California gold rush.
"It's oka\ to work SO hours per week for five
veats lu re.' with everyone hoping to gel rich
and relax later.
Mink, who just finished law school at 3:ob
p.m. last I uesday, freely confesses his own
habit of putting in 80-hour weeks as a law stu
dent. c horeographer, modern dance instruc
toi and member of Vintage Dance Ensemble.
In c t eating a dance about this lifestyle, Flink
original!) imaged the dance as a tvpe of in
fomercial tor a fictitious company,
vel« Kitv.com.
but in lieu of the company, "Inter-relation
ships of thai particular group [with whic h| he
was working . . . came out in rehearsal," s.iid
Dance Division instructor Dane Frank.
"Somehow, underneath whatever else is hap
pening, there's a human connection that dri
ves things."
In the final piece, according to Flink,
"dancers became much more important than
idea of velcx ity.com."
I he only thing left of the original dance is
its physical energy, athleticism and visceral
motion, said Flink. It is all set to music by
artists such .is Tori Amos and the Crash Test
I )ummies.

I he style is my style. It's inv own move
ment, self-generated." he said, admitting his
physical approach to dancing probably stems
from playing club socx er as an undergraduate
at the University of Minnesota.
His dance group of five Stanford under
graduates and three graduate students have
already performed the piece several times
during the first weekend of Spring Migration.
V\ hat s so ama/ing is the visceral connec-

tion the audiences have been having," Flink
said. " I hey were screaming. The audience re
sponse is really rowdy — it's fun."
I his is the last weekend to see the Spring
Migration concert. Final performances are
today and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. in Roble
Dance Studio. I ickets are available at the door
and are $10 for general admission and $5 for
students and seniors. Flink's dance is the fi
nale.
