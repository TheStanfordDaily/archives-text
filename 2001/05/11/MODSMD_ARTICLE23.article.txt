# Congress approves the new 2002 budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —A
fractured Congress approved a
final budget for next year that
promises deep tax cuts and bri
dled spending, awarding a victo
ry to President George VV. Bush
though there were signs tln
road to achieving those goals
may be bumpy.
With centrist Democrats pro
viding pivotal support, the even
ly divided Senate cleared the
$ 1.95 trillion budget yesterday
by a near party-line 53-47 vote.
Defections by Republican Sens.
James Jeffords of Vermont and
Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island
were outweighed by five De
mocrats who backed the GOP
written plan.
"Now is not the time, with
these circumstances, to figure
out how we disagree," said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., who sup
ported the budget after leading
a bloc of 14 moderate Democ
rats whom the White House ro
manced with only partial suc
cess. "Now is the time to figure
out how we can reach an agree
ment for the good of all the peo
ple we represent."
I lie president views this as a
very important day in his new
presidency, and he is very
pleased to thank the Democrats
that helped make this possible,"
White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said.
I ndei lining the partisan ten
sions tli.it the budget fight exac
erbated, Senate Majority Whip
Don Nic kles, R-Okla., expressed
unhappiness with 10 moderate
Democrats who had supported
an earlier version of the budget
but voted no yesterday.
"It told me they don't want to
participate in writing the tax
bill." he said. Lawmakers who
supported the budget "have a
greater likelihood of being given
some attention" as the Senate
composes its tax bill in coming
days, he said.
I he budget would permit a
tax cut of $1.35 trillion over 11
years, $100 billion of which may
come this year and next in an at
tempt to boost the economy.
Bush wanted a $1.6 trillion re
duction over 10 years, but was
forced to settle for less by the Sen
ate's narrow political balance.
"You didn't get everything
you want, Mr. President," said
the Budget Committee chair
man, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-
N.M. "You have made us
change direction. You have
moved us in the direction of giv

ing back taxes to the American
people, rather than giving them
the last cut of the deck."
Importantly for Bush and his
GOP allies, budget passage
means the $1.35 trillion tax bill
cannot be filibustered, a proce
dural delay that takes 60 votes to
halt. Republicans say they will
pursue even deeper tax cuts, but
those won't have the budget's
protection.
I he budget would hold
spending for most federal pro
grams— other than automatic
benefit programs like Social Se
curity— to $661 billion next
year, a four percent increase.
I liat is what Bush had pro
posed. But it is half the size of
this year's growth in spending,
and even some Republicans
concede privately that it is unre
alisticallv low.
I he measure calls for increas
es for education, defense, bio
medical research and other pro
grams, and leaves the door open
for further military spending
the Pentagon is expected to re
quest soon. But most moderates
of both parties who opposed the
budget said it set too little aside
for schools, casting further
doubt on efforts to restrain
spending.
Ihe House approved the
budget on Wednesday by 221-
207, also along party lines. The
blueprint, which sets non-bind
ing targets for future bills that will
cut taxes and finance agencies,
does not need Bush's signature.
1 he bulk of Democrats op
posed the budget as clearing the
way for an excessive tax cut that
would siphon money needed to
bolster Social Security,
Medicare, schools, debt reduc
tion and other priorities. They
said G( )P claims of forging good
working relationships with De
mocrats were bogus.
"We have all heard the
mantra that the tone of Wash
ington is being changed,"
mocked Sen. Robert Byrd, D-
W.V a. "When it was time for the
rubber to hit the road, biparti
sanship had a flat tire."
1* urther problems cropped
up shortly after the budget vote.
Senate Democrats meeting pri
vately to discuss the tax bill
raised questions about its con
tents and urged their chief ne
gotiator, Sen. Max Baucus of
Montana, the top Democrat on
the tax-writing Senate Finance
Committee, to slow down the
OOP's rapid-fire schedule.

I liat is what Bush had pro
posed. But it is half the size of
this year's growth in spending,
and even some Republicans
concede privately that it is unre
alisticallv low.
I he measure calls for increas
es for education, defense, bio
medical research and other pro
grams, and leaves the door open
for further military spending
the Pentagon is expected to re
quest soon. But most moderates
of both parties who opposed the
budget said it set too little aside
for schools, casting further
doubt on efforts to restrain
spending.
Ihe House approved the
budget on Wednesday by 221-
207, also along party lines. The
blueprint, which sets non-bind
ing targets for future bills that will
cut taxes and finance agencies,
does not need Bush's signature.
1 he bulk of Democrats op
posed the budget as clearing the
way for an excessive tax cut that
would siphon money needed to
bolster Social Security,
Medicare, schools, debt reduc
tion and other priorities. They
said G( )P claims of forging good
working relationships with De
mocrats were bogus.
"We have all heard the
mantra that the tone of Wash
ington is being changed,"
mocked Sen. Robert Byrd, D-
W.V a. "When it was time for the
rubber to hit the road, biparti
sanship had a flat tire."
1* urther problems cropped
up shortly after the budget vote.
Senate Democrats meeting pri
vately to discuss the tax bill
raised questions about its con
tents and urged their chief ne
gotiator, Sen. Max Baucus of
Montana, the top Democrat on
the tax-writing Senate Finance
Committee, to slow down the
OOP's rapid-fire schedule.
