WASHINGTON (AP) — House
members angered by the ouster of the
United States from the U.N. Commis
sion on Human Rights exacted some re
venge yesterday by voting convincingly
to withhold some back U.N. dues until
America is restored to the panel.
The Bush administration opposed
that action, but GOP leaders champi
oned rhe fight to punish the internation
al organization. The most visible backers
of the White House position were De
mocrats.
"1 implore my colleagues," said Ma
jority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. "If
you believe in the cause of liberty, free
dom, safety, security, respect and decen
cy, vote yes for this amendment. Send
the world a message: America cares and
America dares to stand up for any lost
soul beleaguered and tortured in any
part of this world at any time."
1 he vote was 252-165 for the measure
that would allow one payment of $582
million in back dues but hold back an ad
ditional $244 million until the United
States is back on the human rights panel.
An initial $100 million back-dues pay
ment occurred last year.
The provision was attached to the
State Department spending authoriza
tion bill for 2002-2003. A I louse vote on
that bill is expected next week, and the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee is
still writing its version.
In other amendments yesterday, the
I louse:

— Showed it was not opposed to all
things United Nations In voting 225-193
to support a return to the U.N. Educa
tional, Scientific and Cultural Organi/a
tion, and pay it $05 million. I lie I nited
States left UNESCO in 1984, upset In
management problems and what was
perceived to be an anti-American bent.
— Voted 282-137 to keep the United
States out of the International Criminal
Court. Majority Whip Tom DeLav con
tended it could be used against l .S.
military personnel overseas and In en
dorsing the court, "we would be aban
doning the sacred covenant between
the Congress and our men and women
in uniform."
As for the U.N. back dues, several law
makers citing the U.S. ejection from the
human rights panel had sought to bloc k
the $582 million payment.
That prompted the International Re
lations Committee chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-111., and Rep. Pom Pan
tos of California, the panel's top Democ
rat, to offer the compromise saving the
immediate $582 million pavmcnt de
spite their own anger at the U.N. action.
" I his is a deliberate attempt to punish
the United States for its insistence that
we tell the truth about human rights
abuses wherever they occur, including in
those countries represented on the com
mission, such as ('.iiina and (aiba," I Ivde
said, calling on (ongress to send a return
message.
White House spokesman Ari Fleisch

er said Wednesday that President Bush
"feels strongly that this issue should not
be linked to the payment of our arrears
to the U.N. and other international or
ganizations," But Hyde said after the
vote that the administration never con
tacted him or l^antos.
Several Democrats sided with Bush.
"How can we expect the United Na
tions to improve its performance, or to
respect us it we go back on our word and
refuse to pay our bills?" asked Rep. Cyn
thia Mc Kinney of Georgia.
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said it
would "break our contract" under which
the U.S. portions of U.N. dues and
peacekeeping expenses are being re
duced. "This is wrong, and I think we
would be ashamed if our children acted
in this manner."
After the vote, White House
spokesman Sean McCormack said:
"()iu position is we're committed to pav
ing our arrears. To do otherwise now
would undermine what we're doing at
the U.N. and our credibility as a negoti
ating partner."
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said
the $582 million has been pledged to
countries with troops serving in U.N.
peacekeeping missions.
"All $582 million are going directly to
troop contributors, to peacekeeping, so
we have a lot of eager candidates await
ing that money and I think it would be a
very negative reaction it it didn't arrive,"
Eckhard said.
