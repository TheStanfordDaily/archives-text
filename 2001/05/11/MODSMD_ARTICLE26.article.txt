# FDA approves new leukemia drug
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — A new drug
that helped more than 90 percent of pa
tients with a rare form of leukemia won
government approval in record time
yesterday and was hailed as "the wave of
the future" in fighting cancer.
" 1 his new drug, we believe, is a pic
ture of the future of cancer treatment,"
said Dr. Ric hard 1). Klausner, director of
the National Cancer Institute.
Food and Drug Administration ap
proval of Gleevec was announced by
Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy Ci. Thompson at a news confer
ence, an unusual step fora drug approval.
Gleevec, made by Novartis Fharma
eeuticals, is specifically targeted at
chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease
that claims about 2,300 American lives
annually.
Thompson said the drug is based on
the principle of molecular targeting,
killing leukemia cells while leaving nor
mal white cells alone.
"We believe such targeting is the wave
of the future," he said.
Dawn Willis, scientific programs di
rector for the American Cancer Society,
also praised the approval.
"I can't think of another cancer
drug that has shown such spectacular

success in .1 group of people thai had
failed all othei treatment," >1 ic* said.
She said the concept of attacking ( .ni
cer by designing a small molecule that
will specifically attack a target protein
should be usable in other forms of the
disease as well.
(1 lee vet itself is being tested against
about ado/en forms of the disease, and
researchers are working on other similar
targeting drugs.
Dr. Daniel Yasella, president of No
vartis AG, the Swiss parent company,
saicl he hopes to begin shipping the drug
by next Monday and to have it in phar
macies within a week.
U.S. shares of Novartis were up
$3.09, or eight percent, to $42.00 in af
ternoon trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
The one-pill-a-day regimen is expect
ed to cost between $2,000 and $2,400
monthly, which company officials s.iid is
comparable to other current cancer
treatments.
But Yasella said the company is set
ting up a program to make sure it is
available to uninsured, low-income peo
ple. He said it would be priced .it a slid
ing scale for people with incomes below
$100,000 a year and would be free for

those with an income of under $40,000.
(i lee vet works by blocking chemical
signals sent by cancerous cells, and re
searchers hope ii will also prove useful in
a form of stomach tumor and perhaps
other types of cancer as well.
The results of clinical trials of the
drug, also known .is S IT-571 or imatinib
mesylate, generated excitement among
cancer researchers.
Chronic myeloid leukemia is caused
bv a protein that produces an abnormal
chromosome. It leads to a huge increase
in the number of white blood cells in the
body, which can interfere with the func
tioning of other organs.
In clinical trials financed by Novar
tis, more than 90 percent of patients in
the fust phase of ('.ML saw their cancer
go into remission within, the first six
months of taking the pill, according to
findings presented in December at a
meeting of the American Society of
I fematologv.
A study of patients in the second
phase of the disease showed more than
90 percent of those patients responded
positively to the treatment, and in 63
percent, the cancer went into remis
sion. The trials involved 530 fust
phase and 230 second-phase patients.
