PORTLAND, Ore. (Al») —
Six years after she was para
lyzed from the neck down in a
rollover accident, Linda Mc-
Cathern won her lawsuit
against I ovota Motor Corp. in
the Oregon Supreme Court
yesterday.
I he justices sided unani
mously with McCathern, ruling
the automaker designed a de
fective sport utility vehicle and
must pa\ her $7.(> million. With
interest, the judgment will be
between $10 million and $1 I
million, s.iid Mc(lat hern's attor
ney, Jeffrey Foote.
Foote s.iid the case sets a
precedent for other SUV
rollover cases.
"lUnfortunately, this is not a
problem limited to Tovota 4-
Runners." Foote said. Manufac
turers know SI Vs are not safe,
Foote s.iid, and are not doing
anything about it.
"It's a profits-befbre-peo pie
kind of situation, lie said.
( larence I )itlow, director of
the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington, D.C., called the
ruling against Foyota "well de
set ved" .iikl said it "sendsa mes
sage to I oyota, the government
and other auto manufacturers
to make SI As safer.
" Flic case exemplifies what's
wrong with SUVs. I'hey are
rollover prone, and the I'ovota
4-Runnei is one of the more
rollover-prone Sl'Vs on (In
road," he said.
A I oyota official in 1 .os Ange
les s.iid vestcrdav the conipam's
law vers were reviewing the deci
sion .ind would not comment
until the re\ iew was complete.
McCathern, who uses a

wheelchair, said she needs the
award tnone\ tocarefbi herself
and her children.
" I hat money's got to last me
the next T>o years, to take ( are of
myself and my daughters, put
all three of them through col
lege. Bv no means am I going to
live the life of luxury now," the
43-vear-old said after the ruling.
McCathern said she hopes
young buvcrs will take note that
SI As are prone to rolling over,
especially some older models.
"1 want no more people to
die or be maimed like I have
been," Mc(lathcrn said.
I he Supreme (loin t upheld
earlier ()regon ('.out tof Appeals
and tii.il court decisions that
Foyotas 1994 4-Runner had a
defective design and was prone
to roll over because its center of
gravity was too high.
On Memorial I >.i\ weekend
in 1995, McCathern was a pas
senger in a 1994 I ovota 4-Run
ncr being driven In her cousin
in eastern Washington. Ihe
cousin swerved to avoid an on
coming car, .uul the SI V rolled
twice,< rushingthc roof and pas
senger side .nid injuring Mc
(iathern.
A Multnomah Countv jur\

1997. lovota challenged the
award, but it was upheld by tin
stale Com I of Appeals two vears
ago. I lie car-maker then ap
pealed to the Supreme (lourt.
I oyota ( hallenged the negli
gence .ind design defect claims
and sought to reduce the award,
citing Oregon law that limited
damages fbi pain and suffering
to $i) 0(),()()(). I'he state Supreme
( ouri later lilted that cap.
