BOSTON (AP) â€”Uitder a
doc tor's orders to rest while await
ing the birth of twins, acting (io\.
|ane M. Swift is gelling grief from
Democ rats who question whether
she- can legally run the state from
her hospital bed.
\fter Swill corneiied a meeting
of the (iovei not's ( ounc il by tele
phone Wednesday, the panel
voted 5-.S to ask the states highest
c oin til the pi a< tic e is constitution
al for official meetings. A hearing
date has not been set.
Swift c liiel of staff Peter l< >rman
dismissed the move as "political
gamesmanship." I he ( ouncil is an
elected board that approves judi
cial appointments, gubernatorial
pardons and bond issues. All eight
members are Denioc rals; Swill is a
Republic an.
Swift said she has no plans to re
linquish authority to Secretary of
Stale William Calvin, a Democ rat
who is next in the line of succes

sioii. She is cxpcc ted to give birth
in the next week or two.
Swift, .it ,S(j, is the nation's
youngest governor and the first
known to be pregnant in office.
Her attempts to balance mother
hood and career were .1 long-run
ning politic .il storv even before she
took over .is governor April 10,
when Ciov. Paul (lellucci resigned
to beeoine ambassadoi to (Canada.
She announced she was preg
nant when running for lieutenant
governot in 1998, deliveringa girl
three weeks before she was elect
ed. An ethics panel later fined bet
$1,250 for allowing aides to baby
sit the child, now 2 I / 2. She was
also critici/.ed for using a state heli
copter fora trip home 011 1 banks
giving.
Don't look for female voters in
this heavih Democratii state to
rush to her defense.
|ill Ness, a SI-vear-old mother,
said Swift 111.iv regret spending too

much time on the political stage
when her children are young.
"It 111.iv be satisfying for her
now to hold sue b .111 impoi t.mt of -
fice, but later on she's going to miss
those precious moments," Ness
said.
Swift's job approval has iiu bed
up recently, to II pert cut iu .1
Boston Herald poll List month
from 2") percent in l ebi 11.11 v. Sw ill
lias not said whether she will 11111
fin a lull term in 2002.
Swift is not the first < hiel e\c< 11-
tive to contluc t official business
while not phvsicallv present: lu
1947, Boston's James Michael
Curley ((inducted mayoral busi
ness for five months while in jail foi
fraud.
I'aul Martinek, an attorne\ with
Massachusetts Lawver's Weeklv,
said the state constitution does not
appeal to require the governor to
be phvsicallv present at council
meetings.
But Democratic (ounciloi I d
ward () Bricn said Swift must be in
the comic il chambers or dec I.ire
herself unable to pertoi m the du
ties of govei nor.
"If there is a question of inca
pacity,' Swift should tin 11 ovei
the reins of government to
(ialvin, he said.
(VBrien's daughter, state I rea
surer Shannon O'Brien, is .1 De
mocrat weighing .1 run for gover
nor. She has defended Swift.
"I know my father, I know he's a
real sti< klcr fin the 1 ulcs and .1 true
student of the st.ite ( (institution,
and so I can understand them
wanting to get some c larification,"
said Shannon O'Brien, who gave
birth to a girl during her first year
in office. "From tnv point of view,
we should be doing everything we
c an to accommodate her."
A Democrat on the council,
Marv-Kllcn Manning, also spoke
up for Swift: " I his is a grave situa
tion. She is flat on her back. Why is
providing these accommodations
to a pregnant worker causing such
a ruckus?"
Republican National ( oniniiitee
( o-( '.hair Ann Wagner critic i/ecl the
counc il fi>rt hallenging Swift.
I his is totally out of line and
an insult to working moms all
across the country," she said. "I
wonder if they would be com
plaining if the governor was a
man recovering from prostate
cancer surgery."
Swift said she does not consid
er herself incapacitated. She was
ordered to rest by her doctor on
I uestlay after experiencing t on
tractions.
