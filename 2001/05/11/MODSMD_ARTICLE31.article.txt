### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
May Madness has arrived.
No — neither Jason Richard
son, Shane Battier, Juan Dixon
nor Loren Woods will be here to
lead his team to a repeat Final
Four performance.
Instead, another group ol
names — including Alex Kim,
Marco Baron, Peter Luc/.ak and
()skar Johansson — will lead their
schools into a field of 64 men's col
legiate tennis teams in hopes of
winning this year's NCAA Men's
Tennis (Championship.
Ted by Kim (25-3), a senior who
sits atop the national rankings, No.
2 Stanford (21-1. 7-0 Pacific 10
(Conference) will begin its quest for
an unprecedented 18th national
team title this weekend.
Due to its extraordinary regular
season team record, the Cardinal,
the top seed in the tournament, will
begin its journey to a second
straight NCAA Team Champi
onship and play the first two
rounds of the tournament ai home.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will
host the Pacific Tigers (14-10),
who have made tourney play by
virtue of their first-ever Big West
(championship.
If the Cardinal wins, as expec t
ed, the team will move on to face
the winner of 31 st-ranked Florida
(9-16) and 39th-ranked Okla
homa State (15-8).
However, head coach Dick
Could has warned his team to

avoid complacency.
"We can't think about Athens
until we get through this week
end," lie said. "It won't be easy."
Sophomore Clatter Morris
agreed with his coach.
"We won't look past the first
two rounds because our season
could be over it we do," he said.
In playing the 'Tigers, the Car
dinal will be facing the Big West
Coach of the Year Cuido Bau
mann and also the Big West Play
er of the Year junior Dietrich
Haug. Despite the accolades, the
Tigers look to be just another ca
sualty in Stanford's pursuit of vet
another national title.
At No. 1 singles, Kim will try to
stave off an upset bid by Haug.
With the wav Kim has been play
ing lateh, though, the (icrman na
tive will probably be leaving the
court quickly.
Recently, Kim repeated as the

with Stanford's top seed in the
tournament, (iould believes
that the tournament will be a
challenge.
"1 think that in fairness, al
though our record is very good,
a lot of our wins were against
teams without their top play
ers," he said. "A lot of the teams
that we beat were not at full
strength, which will make the
tournament tough."

are razor sharp right now. Al
though its natural for the team to
let clown [around last week), it's
also time to get back into things
and build towards nationals."
