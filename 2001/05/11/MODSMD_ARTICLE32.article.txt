### BRIAN DECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fhe Stanford women's tennis
team has some unfinished busi
ness to attend to.
The Cardinal dominated the
2000 season, going undefeated
with a 25-0 record and entering
the N(AA lournament as fa
vorites. But in the title malt h, the
Cardinal was upset In Georgia in
a tight 5-4 decision.
Now in 2001, the No. I Cardi
nal is once again undefeated (24-
0) and will once again enter the
tournament, which starts this
weekend, as favorites.
In todav's action, Stanford
hosts Boston College (11-7) .it 2
p.m. at the Taube Family I ennis
Stadium. I he winner advances
to the second round to face the
winner between Louisiana State
(1 1-9) and Mississippi (9-12) Sat
urday at 2:!i0 p.m. Fat h region's
winner moves on to Stone Moun
tain, Georgia for the round of 10
and, later, the NCAA finals.
I lie (lardinal is not without
weaponry going into this battle.
Sophomore Laura Granville is
the top-ranked player in the na
tion and was named Pacific 10
(conference Player of the Year on
Monday, (iranville broke the
NCAA record ibis season by win
ning her 58th consecutive singles
match on the way to a 22-1 dual
record.
Her teammates, juniors Lau
ren Kalvaria and (iabrit la Lastra,
are the No. 9- and No. 17-ranked
NCAA players, respectively.

kalvaria teamed with freshman
Lauren Barnikow to form the
No. I doubles team in the coun
try, and the duo took Pac-10 hon
ors tor Doubles l earn of the
Year.
Cranville and Kalvaria were
honored as First Team All Pac
10, while Lastra was named to
the Second Team.
It has been .1 truly memorable
season for the Cardinal, who de
feated every conference foe twice
and overpowered non-confer
ence forces Hawaii, Illinois State,
Fresno State, Pacific, Pepper
dine, UNLV and BYU.
1 lie postseason opened April
20 with the Pac-lO Individual
Championship, where
Barnikow joined senior Sarah
Pestieau and freshmen Fmilia
Anderson and Lizzy Bennett.
Bennett and Anderson won in
the fu st round, but the Cardinal
did not make it past the second,
fop players (iranville, Kalvaria,
Lastra and No. 50 Keiko Toku
da opted out of the Pac-10 Indi
viduals .md have not had match
play since the end of the regular
season, April 21.
" I he team is looking forward
to playing some matches," said
head coach Lele Forood. "We're
raring to go."
Since it is the only undefeated
team in Division I and the num
ber one seed in the field of 04, all
eyes will be on Stanford. Teams
were selected based on won-lost
record, strength of schedule and
eligibility and availability of stu
dent-athletes.
I hough last year's upset
tame under similar circum
stances, the (Cardinal remains fo
cused on the here and now. 1 he
voting team wants to establish
that it is the best in the country,
able to withstand the toughest
opponents. Conference rivals
No. 7 California, No. 10 CSC,
No. I I Arizona State and No. 14
Washington have provided tests
of Stanford's strength, and the
team has withstood the competi
tion. However, the specter of de
fending champion and fourth
tanked Georgia looms large.
Still, the well-rested Cardinal
squad is poised to conquer the
tournament; half the women
haven't played a match since be
fore the Pat -10s, a period of over
20 da\ s.
A championship victory
would punctuate the Cardinal's
magical season with an exclama
tion point. It would prove last
year's championship game to be
a fluke, the team's one and only
loss mix c Manh r>, 1999.
"It's time," Forood said. "Let's
get started this year. Let's play
well. Let's get down to Georgia."
