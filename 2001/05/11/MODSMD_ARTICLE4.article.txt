T. Jost presented his lecture on "The
Psvcholog\ of Deservingness: ()vercom
ing Ambivalence and 'Depressed In tit le
nient' in Women" yesterday at the l ac ul
tv (illll).
I'hisevent, sponsored In the Institute
for Rcscarc li on Women and (lender, is
part of a series of let tines called the L'OOI
Breakfast Seminar Series on (lender and
the Workplace. 1 hough open to the gen

eral public and Stanford faculty, stu
dents and staff, thisearlv-morning series
inainh attracts professionals in the busi
ness world.
In Jost's seminar about the work
world, he explains "depressed entitle
ment" to be- "the tendency for women to
feel that tliev deserve less or that their
work is worth less, in comparison to what
men think and feel about themselves."
I he first studies on this phenomenon
were conducted in the 19705. In these
studies, men and women were asked
how iniK li they should be paid for their

work, and women ( hose to
pay themselves less than men tin the
same kind of work.
Che data from this study supported
the ideas that either women valued othei
factors than money or wanted to be
"nice" instead of '"greed v." In the 1980s.
Brenda Major, a professor ;it I C-S.inta
Barbara, proposed that different inter
nal standards of tail pay were .1 result of
the different internal standards of com
parison between men and women.
Intrigued bv this study, Jost cre
ated .i similar experiment while he
was a graduate student in psychol
ogy at Yale I niversit\ in the early
19905. His experiment enlisted
132 Vale students — both men
and women — to evaluate essays
they wrote and essays written by
others.
I he results revealed that, over
all, women rated their own work as
less sophistic ated, less original and
less insightful than the men did.
Moreover, women paid them

selves an average of $1.50 less an
hour than men when asked how
much money they deserved to be
paid.
Jost then showed the essays to
two external, independent judges,
and each perceived the essavs of
men and women to be compara
ble. Therefore, there were no de
ferences in the quality of the work.
I'he difference lay in the perceived
self-entitlement.
In another study, conducted by
Mah/arin ttanaji, one of Jost's pro
fessors at Yale, and Tony Green
wald, a professor at the University
of Washington, performed a series
of experiments that studied how
well men and women remember

and identify male and female
n.lines.
I he subjects were exposed to
non-famous names one day. Then,
a couple of days later, they were
given a list of names with some fa
mous people, some non-famous
people whose names they had seen
a couple of days before and some
non-famous names they had never
seen. They were asked to circle all
of the famous people.
Overall, the subjects circled a
large number of famous people
without discriminating between fa
mous men or women. Also, with
out favoring men or women, the
participants circled a few of the
names they had never seen before.

112 lowever, with regards to the non
famous names they had seen be
fore, respondents were three times
as likely to inaccurately select a
non-famous male name to be fa
mous as compared to a non-fa
mous female name.
It appears, therefore, th.it a fa
miliar male name seems more like
ly famous than a familiar female
name. The only exception to this
conclusion was a group of students
enrolled in a "feminist-oriented"
women's studies course. These
participants displayed no system
atic discrimination.
About this Jost commented,
"I'm personally sympathetic to
courses that raise awareness of in

equality and its consequences. But
I can't say that my research un
equivocally supports the effective
ness of women's studies courses."
Annie Abrains attended
the seminar and said, "1 was im
pressed bv Professor (ost's insight
fill and thoughtful research. Mis
findings opened my eyes to the
often overlooked obstacles facing
women in the workplace."
In addition to "depressed enti
tlement," |ost also explores
women's ambivalence, which he
explained is when " [women] si
multaneously have very positive
and very negative attitudes about
women."
Jost also points out that, while

there are clearly still gender issues
in the work place, some aspects are
steadily improving. Today,
women are paid about 80 cents to
every man's dollar, as compared to
fi9 cents in 1990.
In response to how we can over
come "depressed entitlement" and
ambivalence, Jost proposes that
people increase their awareness of
potential bias, encourage blind se
lection procedures, begin a correc
tion and adjustment process and
reward, value and establish equali
ty, tolerance and diversity.
Already Jost is part of the solu
tion, as he is currently teaching
these values in the Business
School.
