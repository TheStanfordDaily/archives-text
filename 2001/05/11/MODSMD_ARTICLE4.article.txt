In Jost's seminar about the work
world, he explains "depressed entitle
ment" to be- "the tendency for women to
feel that tliev deserve less or that their
work is worth less, in comparison to what
men think and feel about themselves."
I he first studies on this phenomenon
were conducted in the 19705. In these
studies, men and women were asked
how iniK li they should be paid for their

work, and women ( hose to
pay themselves less than men tin the
same kind of work.
Che data from this study supported
the ideas that either women valued othei
factors than money or wanted to be
"nice" instead of '"greed v." In the 1980s.
Brenda Major, a professor ;it I C-S.inta
Barbara, proposed that different inter
nal standards of tail pay were .1 result of
the different internal standards of com
parison between men and women.
