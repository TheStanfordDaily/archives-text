Bridge I'eer Counseling Center's 31st an
nual Spring Faire, which starts todav.
White's st.ind will include her own
prints, stationary, greeting cards and hand
made dolls, all evoking her sign.it lire urban
theme. I he Fast I'alo Alto native's work
mostly consists of bright colored urban

scenes of Afrit an Americans.
"As an African American, 1 associate
stmnglv with im heritage," said White. "Mv
work is considered urban art because I de
pict mostly ethnic people in urban areas, like
ja// concerts or niglii clubs."
I he artist stresses that her hand-made
dolls are African American.
I never had black dolls growing [up]
because ilicv weren't made," slit* said. "I
believed thai there was something wrong
or ugl\ about being blat k. When I had my

own daughter, I wanted her to pla\ with
blat k dolls. So I made them invself."
I lie Spring Faire, which runs today, to
morrow and Sunday from 10 a.m. to (i p.m.
in White Plaza, includes 100 art stands and
1(1 food vendors. The Fa ire is the Bridge's
sole source of income.
"The Faire is full of great artists," said
co-coordinator lai Lot kspeiser, a se
nior. "Alma distinguishes herself,
though, with her strong connection to
the local community."

Lot kspeiser explained that White's tal
ent and skill radiate from her work.
"Alma was [accepted] into the Spring
I'aire just like everyone else," she said. "I let
work goes bevond talent â€” it rellects her
energy and spirit."
White's artwork has its own style that
reflet ts her unique background, s.iid Amir
khatihi, owner ol (late Renaissance, a Palo
Alto restaurant tb.it displays 15 White
originals.
"She paints bright colors, mostly bal

lerinas and diildren playing," lie said.
"I ler work spreads a general happiness."
White s Spring Faire displa\ will fea
tnre the print "Universal Lady," which
depicts a woman holding up the planet
Saturn.
" Hie painting symbolizes how pe< >ple< an
overcome odds," White said. "Which is ex
actly what I did."
White's financial problems bottomed
out seven years ago when her mother
died. I he government sold her mother's
house, where White had been living. Al
though White worked as a housekeeper
and a nurse lor the elderly, she was left
with a small inheritance and no home.
"I rented .1 room fora while, but with
rent the wa\ it was, the mone\ ran out
quick." she said.
White spent three nights sleeping on
beiu lies 111 Palo Alto and Menlo Park. ()n
the third night, a conversation with a
stranger rekindled her interest in art. She
then spent tour months m the Roland
Hills Kstate homeless sheltci before
lautu liing her < areer as an artist.
Shortly after, White opened Kxpres
sions of Kbony, a sin.ill start-up business,
to promote and sell her artwork. 1 lei art
work ranges from $5 pipe cleaner dolls to

$1000 original paintings. She mostl\ uses
acrvlii paint, but White also works with
pencil, crayon and "whatever else is
around."
Although she supports herself as an
artist, White still receives Social Securitx
benefits. In addition to the Spring I aire
and dale Renaissance, While's work is also
on displa\ at The Cireat American Flam
ing Shop on I lamilton Street in Palo Alto.
White's experience living without .1
home lias dearly influenced her work,
said Brooke Atherton, special projects as
sistant at the Haas ('.enter. "Her work
spreads happiness and urges people to
take lite in their own hands."
White's creativity and artistic direction
changed as she gained life experience, she
said. "1 have become more open. I lungs
that fora long time didn't seem possible 01
make sense, I understand now.
White olten depicts 1 haracters without
faces in her art in order to capture and*
represent aspects of being homeless and
black.

"1 used to onl\ chaw people with laces,
noses and mouths. I didn't understand or
care for faceless people," White said.
"Now it seems natural, normal and deeply
personal to paint people without lac es."
"Alma believes, and therefore her work
demonstrates, that people can come from
all walks of life and become anything,"
Atherton said.
White's lies to Palo Alto and its home
less community, as well as her charismatic
personality, make her a favorite of Stan
ford students. In the past, she has worked
closely with the Haas ('.enter, specifically
with the 1 lonieless and 1 lunger program.
"It's so nice to work with a local artist
who has siu b strong roots in and c ares for
the area," lockspeiser said. "Her home
less experience is without a doubt a domi
nating present e in her wot k."
White's commitment to Palo Alio, how
ever, surpasses her pictures. Am excess
profits she makes, she donates to helping
people experiencing hard times, Lock
speiser said.
