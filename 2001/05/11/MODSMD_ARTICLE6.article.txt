### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The 21 st annual International Festival
will be held tomorrow from noon to 5:45
p.m. at the Bechtel International ( enter.
There will be food, music, dance, martial
arts and many other presentations display
ing the international culture present on
Stanford's campus.
The festival provides the international
community with a forum to "showcase their
culture in a fun way," said Lynn Kroner, a
international student advisor.
I here was a similar international festival
held in White Plaza and Dinkclspicl Audi
torium during the 1950s and 1900s orga
nized by community volunteers, but these
volunteers eventually decided that their en
ergy could be used more productively in
other ventures, such as putting together
Fnglish language tutorial programs and so
cial partnerships with international stu
dents. For the last 21 years, though, Bccli
tel has organized the festival.
"I started off with my list of student orga
nizations, and I contacted them to tell them
about the festival and asked if they were in

terested in performing," Kroner said.
Kroner has been involved iu the festival
since 1991. but, since around 1994, she has
been its main organizer.
"Without Lynn Kroner there would not
be an international festival of this na
ture . . . She is the catalyst for ii all," said
John Pearson, the director of the interna
tional center. "She keeps us all in line and
on schedule."
Most of the international groups will set
up showcase tables to display their cultures
and educate the greater Stanford commu
nity. Last year, the Persian Student Associa
tion wrote interested students' names in
Farsi. This year, the Fgvptian Student As
sociation plans to set up a similar table.
Food will be sold at the event by com
mercial venders from the Palo Alto commu
nity. Mexican. Persian and Asian foods w ill
all be available at the festival.
A Stanford Tae Kwon Do demonstra
tion, an Aikido demonstration by the
Stanford |apanese Association and a
Brazilian capoiera performance by the
Brazilian Student Association are all part
of ilic day's festivities.
" I he intent is to present an op
portunity for the international
community to display their cul
ture through dance, music and
other community actives," said
Pearson.
