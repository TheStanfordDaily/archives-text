A CALL TO ACTION:
STANFORD'S COMMUNITY CENTERS
On November 21, 2000, Concerned Students for Community Centers
took out an ad in The Stanford Daily, calling for
... ~
♦ Increased funding; 1
♦ Permanent (base budget) funding; a call to action.-
♦ A guarantee of sufficient and central space;
♦ Permanent funding for at least two full-time PS
employees; and "V'.f'f
♦ the ability to fundraise W** IE!
for the Asian American Activities Center, the Black Community Services Center, El
Centro Chicano, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center, the
Native American Cultural Center, and the Women's Community Center.
We are pleased to report that three of these five objectives have been met, and that
progress has been made on the remaining two.
Next year, each of these six centers will receive $50,000 in programming funds, half
of which will be located within the base budget. The other half will take the form of
three-year discretionary funding, with the intent to roll this into permanent funding
in the future. In addition, the Women's Community Center and the LGBTCC will both
have full-time assistant directors.
Moreover, Vice Provost Montoya has committed to working with the Office of Development in the Future in order to explore
new fundraising possibilities for the Community Centers and all of Student Affairs.
Lastly, a discussion has been initiated on the topic of space. It will be an ongoing objective of students concerned with
community centers to maintain adequate and centrally located space for all six centers. For the three centers located in
Old Union, this will mean monitoring the future of that building as it is considered for renovation or reconstruction. In the
case of the Black Community Services Center, this will eventually mean finding a larger and more adequate building.
We would like to express our most sincere gratitude to Provost Etchemendy, Vice Provost Montoya, and Dean Wais
for their support of the centers. They have met with students consistently to discuss this issue, and their commitment to
the centers has been made clear by next year's budget allocations. We look forward to working with them in the future.
We would also like to thank all the students and alums who showed their support. Without your understanding of the
urgency and willingness to speak up, this would not have been possible. - - Thank You
