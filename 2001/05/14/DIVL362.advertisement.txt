Alternative medicine" has
gone mainstream. An esti
mated one third of all American
adults use herbal medicines, and
spend over $3 billion per year on
them. I lere are some of the most
popular herbs and supplements,
and the main reasons they're used
(many have multiple uses).
Immunity
Echinacea: Purple conefloieer. Used
to strengthen the immune system.

Chinese herb often taken with
others. Used to boost the immune
system and aid in recovery.
Antioxidants
Taken to help protect the body
from free radicals, which cause
cell damage and impair the
immune system. Free radicals are
formed by metabolic processes,
environmental toxins, and
radiation.
Vitamin C: In high doses, may
help prevent cataracts, cancer
and heart disease. Don't take at
the same time as vitamin E
(decreases absorption). Usual
dose: 2(H) to 1,000 mg a day. Can
be toxic in higher doses.
Vitamin E: May protect against
heart disease and cancer, but not
established. Take with food
(increases absorption). Usual
dose: SO to 4(X) 1U per day. Higher
doses mav be harmful

Tips
■ Herbs are gentle and work
slowly, so give them time
■ Freshness counts, and natural,
high quality ingredients are
better absorbed by the body
(but may cost more)
■ Ask about dose, absorption,
time to kick in, side effects,
fillers, dyes, and how long to
take
■ Look for standardized extracts
(degree of potency)
■ Though not a substitute fora
diet rich in fruits and vege
tables, multi-vitamins may be
good for people who eat on
t he-run
■ Folic acid, a vitamin, is espe
cially important for young
women to prevent brain and
spinal malformations in their
children (400 mg per day)
Explore, but be cautious.
Nothing is without its risks.
Educate yourself before taking
anything new %
