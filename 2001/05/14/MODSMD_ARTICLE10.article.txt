Asian Americans
apprehensive about
'Pearl Harbor'
SAN FRANCISCX) (AP) — Bay Area Asian Ameri
cans say they're apprehensive the new movie "Pearl
Harbor" could rekindle animosity and mistrust toward
Japanese and other groups.
The movie f(K uses on the events of December 7,
1941, when Japanese bombers descended on American
troops and warships in I lawaii.
Mistrust caused the U.S. government to imprison
people of Japanese descent, many of them U.S. citizens,
in relocation camps during World War 11.
John Tateishi, president of the Japanese American
Citizens League, was consulted by Disney studios and
producer Jerry Bruckheimer on the movie's script.
Tateishi said the script is largely fair to Japanese charac
ters, but he worries movie-goers will dwell on the attack
and the attackers.
The ()rganization of Chinese Americans and other
Asian groups plan to launch an education campaign be
fore the film's Memorial Day release.

Judge expands racial
profiling suit
SAN JOSE (AP) — A federal judge has dramatically
expanded a racial profiling lawsuit against the Califor
nia Highway Patrol.
U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled Friday
that a case alleging CMP officers on three occasions
pulled over Hispanic and black men because of their
rat e could become a class-action suit.
As a result, the case now covers all Hispanic and
black drivers stopped by the CHP since June 1998 in
areas that stretch along Highway 101 and Highway 5.
Fogel did not find that the CHP has done anything
wrong — rather, the judge believes if profiling does exist,
it would not likely be limited to a handful of'incidents.
Lawyers who brought the case were elated with the
judge's ruling.
"This makes it much more powerful as a tool to
ac hieve meaningful change in policies that result in
racial profiling," said Jon Streeter, a San Francisco
lawyer whose handling the suit with the American Civil
Liberties Union.

Students occupy building
in protest over janitors' pay
A small sit-in at the University of Connecticut's ad
ministration building entered its third day on Thurs
day, and students vowed to remain in the building until
the university promises to increase janitors' pay.
Andrew Flowers, one of the eight protesters who have
occupied the building since Tuesday, said they were will
ing to miss exams, which begin today, for the cause.
He said that for the last four months students have
urged administrators to raise janitors' minimum wages
to at least $8.47 an hour plus benefits, from their cur
rent $<).. r i(). The increase would match the "prevailing
wage" in the area.
T he university uses its own janitors to clean residence
halls, but it hires Capital Cleaners, a contractor that pays
the lower wages, to clean other buildings, said Richard A.
Veilleux, a university spokesman.
