1929
On May 14, 1975, The Daily printed an
article about protesters.
"About 350 demonstrators sat in the
lobby of the Old Union tor over an hour
yesterday, protesting a University research
contract with Iran and changes in financial
aid programs for minority students.
"About 150 of the protesters, including
many Iranians, chanted and marched in a
picket line outside the building. They later
joined the others in the lobby.
"Inside the building, the relaxed crowd
sang protest songs, listened to speeches, and
cheered at the arrival of a "lemonade pa
rade." ()rganizers wearing light blue arm
bands patrolled the "aisles," making sure
there was sufficient space lor people to
enter and leave the building.
"The marchers entered the building
around 2:10 p.m. and most left by 3:15.
Plainclothes police officers and Santa Clara
County Sheriffs deputies were at the scene,
but no arrests were made and no incidents
of violence were reported.
"Earlier, at least 600 persons, mostly stu
dents, marched across White Plaza and ral
lied outside the Center for Research and
Development in Teaching, in which the
Board of Trustees was holding its monthly
meeting."
Bottom line: Maybe the Humanities Education
Action Team would have even more success if
it invented a "protest song."
