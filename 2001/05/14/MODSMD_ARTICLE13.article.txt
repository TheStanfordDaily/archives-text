Matt Kahn has been a modernist
since modernism was new. But he
knows that when it comes to designing
a room, it's all in the mix — Eames,
Nelson and Bertoia are great, but
don't forget the antique piano and the
African masks. That's why Kahn, who
has taught design at Stanford Univer
sity since 1949, was hired in the late
1950s to decorate model houses for
Joseph Eichler, the legendary West
Coast developer.
Although it was customary at the
time to stock model houses with goods
borrowed from furniture stores, Eich
ler asked the Kahns to apply their
artistic sensibilities to the task. They
mixed antiques with modern pieces.
In other words, they made these places
feel like home.
