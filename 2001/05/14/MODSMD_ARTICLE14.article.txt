### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Timothy
Mc\ eigh's lawyers said yesterday he is re-eval
uating his position on wanting to he executed
after learning the FBI tailed to disclose evi
dence in the ()klahoma (!itv bombing case.
1 he FBl's lapse has prompted members of
Congress to urge hearings into how it hap
pened, and one Democrat wants President
Bush to appoint a blue-ribbon commission to
review the FBI.
McVeigh has not instituted his defense
team to pursue a partii ular legal strategy. But
attorney Robert Nigh said when McVeigh
made his original decision not to pursue fur
ther appeals, he had no idea the FBI had with
held evidence.
"In light of that, it's completely reasonable
for him to re-evaluate Ins position," Nigh told
fox News Sunday." " I he facts of the case are
now certainly at issue."
McVeigh "has indicated now that he is at
least willing to take a fresh look at things, hear
our analysis of the fads contained within the
documents and out legal analvsis of Ins op
tions, Nigh said on (IBS' "lace the Nation."
A second defense lawyer questioned
whether the FBI has disclosed all evidence.
"Are we going to learn next week that there are
yet more documents?" Nathan Chambers said
on ABC's "This Week."
"There are a lot of questions that a lot of peo
ple have for the FBI, and as we move forward
in these next few davs, that question \\ ill be one

that is answered," said Mindy fucker, spokes
woman for Attorney General )ohn Ashcroft.
A former prosecutoi in the case s.iid she be
lieved the foul-up was unintentional and that
the doc uments should not affect the outcome of
the case.
"He has confessed to the crime. I he evi
dence during the trial was absolutely over
whelming," Beth Wilkinson said on ABC. "I be
lieve it is ver\ unlikely that there will be any in
formation that would be useful to Mr.
McVeigh."
McVeigh and his lawyers are considering
whether to seek a delay in Ins execution,
scheduled for Wednesday but postponed
until June I I by Ashcroft because of the evi
dence foul-up.
Ashcroft said he will not impose any furthei
delays.
|list cla\s before McVeigh was to be execut
ed, the FBI disclosed that some !i,13. r > investi
gation materials — including interview reports
and ph\ sical evidence such as photographs, let
ters and tapes — were withheld fry 111
Mc Neigh's lawyers.
Mc Veigh was to be executed for the April I ( .),
1995, bombing of the Alfred I*. Murrah feder
al Building in Oklahoma Citv that killed 1(>8
people, including 19 children.
I he defense team has just begun review ing
the doc uments and Nigh said he was not pre
pared to disclose wh.it was in them. He did,
however, contend that "the fact of the produc -

lion itself could possibly change the legal out
come of the case."
McVeigh, who is in a federal penitentiary in
Terre Haute, 1 ml., had indicated he "did not
wish to spend the rest of his life in an 8-by-12
cell," Nigh said. But that was after losing court
appeals, and before the new evidence now
available to him, the lawyer said.
Asked about trying to put off the execution
beyond June 1 1, Nigh said: "It is his case, and
he has to determine what he wants to do."
Ashcroft was quoted in Sunday's editions of
1 he Daily Oklahoman as saving that "ample
time" has been given to the defense lawyers and
that he has no intention of again extending the
exet ution date.
lie expressed confidence the courts will not
order a new trial for Mc Veigh.
" These documents are not going to create anv
I )asis — that 1 could in anv way f< >resee —l< >r a i lew
trial,' lie added.
Also yesterdav, lawmakers pushed foi congres
si<>nal hearings, and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
said he would ask Bush fora sjxt ial commission to
examine the KB I from top tolxrttom.
S( hunter cited .i number of problems
at the KBI, including the Kebruary arrest
ol agent Robert Philip Hanssen, who is
charged with selling national secrets to
Moscow, and a botched investigation last
vear of nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee.
"We've had mistake after mistake
after mistake,' he said on CBS.
