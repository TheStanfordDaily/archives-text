# Bush prepares long-term energy strategy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AT) — President
George W. Bush is preparing to roll out his
long-term energy strategy with ;i behind-the
scenes appeal for labor union support and
hopes of using diplomat \ lo lap overseas oil.
Hut with rising gasoline prices and more
blackouts likely in California, Bush faced
growing pressure yesterday for immediate
federal action.
California Gov. Gray Davis pleaded for
federal price taps on wholesale energy taps,
and accused the White House of ignoring
"the greed of these Texas energy companies.'
I he Democratic governor singled out elec
tricity generator Reliant Knergy Services Inc.
for "gouging" the largest state.
"It's a big. big buddy of President Bush
and Vice President Cheney," Davis said on
ABC's " This Week." The Bush administra
tion "can't just sit back there and say, 'Hey, it
ain't our problem, " Davis said.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ari/., endorsed a re
duction in the federal gasoline tax, saying it
would "provide very temporary relief." Bush
has resisted that idea. McCain also said on
NBC's "Meet the Press" that the president

should ask Middle I.asi petroleum producers
for "temporal") help" m slow ing I he rise of oil
prices.
Sen. Charles S< limner. D-N.Y., urged the
president to tap the nation's strategic oil re
serve — an approach Bush rejec ted last year
as a candidate.
Bush directed Vice President Cheney on
|an. 'J'.l to studv the nation's energy needs,
and in the ensuing weeks, California's elec
tricity woes have deepened and gas prices
have c limbed toward S.'i a gallon. Bush has
warned of a looming energy "crisis," and on
I hursdav, he will unveil his long-range plan.
Lawmakers up for re-election next year
are growing increasingly anxious about being
blamed for the rising costs ofenergy, and they
are beginning to pressure the president.
But Bush has made plain ih.it his plan con
tains no cjuic k fixes.
Sunday, new details of the plan emerged.
Administration officials said it will:
—Call for reauthorization of the l!)HN
Price-Anderson Ac t, which limits the liability
of nuclear plant operators in major ac cidents.
The law requires nuclear uiiliiies to pool their

money to compensate victims m major acci
dents.
—Seek to provide increased stability in the
nnc lear power industry by offering sale oper
ators increased certainty that their plants' li
censes will be renewed, and provide tax in
centives to encourage smooth transfers (lur
ing sales of plants with strong safety records.
—Direct Secretary of State Colin Powell to
step up diplomatic efforts to expand oil pro
duction in 1 .atin America, Asia and Caspian
Sea nations such as Azerbaijan.
—Urge continuation of existing tax credits
that encourage development of biomass ener
gy generation, in which burning grass, trees
and waste produces electricity.
The administration will try to lay the
groundwork by courting a key labor group
on Monday when Teamsters President fames
Hoffa visits Cheney and Labor Secretary
Klaine Chao. Ilusli wanted to "prebricf
(Hoffa) as to what's coming out so they have
comprehensive understanding and ran make
a judgment if this is something they want to
support," said Cheney spokeswoman fuleau
na (Hover Weiss.
