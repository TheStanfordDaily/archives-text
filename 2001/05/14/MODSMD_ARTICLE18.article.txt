## The 						Stanford Daily Gift, pledge offer meaningful ways for seniors to give back

Published Since IS')I

THK LND OF lilt' academic year
finds the magnificent spring weath
er beckoning us to "snatch a grace
beyond the reach of art" (Pope),
grants us more time for doing what we want,
causes us to cheer or denounce the gods of the
I )raw and prompts us to search for that perfect
summer job.
But for seniors, this time marks a period
of concentrated scrambling for that job, for
thesolution to that relationship, fora place
to live and fora way to give something back
to Stanford before they leave. In addition
to the Senior (lift, seniors can give back to
the University in another way: Students for
Informed (lareer I)ecisions is sponsoring a
graduation pledge, which requires stu
dents to be cognizant of tlie environmental,
• labor and human rights record of any com
pany they may work for in the future. I he
Senior (iilt and graduation pledge are im

portant commitments for the Senior (-lass
and the University. We support the efforts
nl both organizations and urge seniors to
commit to each.
In the age of globalization and free markets,
many businesses have found and employed
creative means of exploiting workers and the
environment to turn a profit. We frequently
hear reports from such well-known abusers as
Nike, (lap and Kathie I.ce (afford, who have
resorted to methods of product ion ih.it employ
child labor and sub-standard working condi
tions and pay and who treat the environment
like a trash bin. In light of the current While
I louse environmental policy, many companies
will now face less stringent rules governing
these and oilier practices, paving a r< >adol gold
and soot.
In the face of this reality, the efforts of Stu
dents for Informed (lareer Decisions to inform
and to make workers aware ol their company's

violations, which mav he occurring within its
economic sphere, are commendable. In addi
tion, the graduation pledge will hopefully re
mind all students who sign it to he active and
aware citizens. Without our vigilance as stu
dents, no policv — environmental, labor or oth
erwise— would hi' challenged and changed.
I he Stanford Democrats and labor and envi
ron mental organi/at ions on campus have all en
dorsed this project, and we would like to add
our support.
I lie other decision seniors are making is
whether or not to contribute to the Senior (>ift,
the annual gilt-giving eflbrt spearheaded l>\
the Senior ('lass presidents. It is a well-estab
lished way for the Senior ('.lass to leave a lega
cy beyond the classroom, as the gilts go to the
Stanford Alumni Association, which uses the
money to put on events during homecoming
week and to give back to the University. Every
year, the student pledges of over $20 will be

I lie sm.ill conlribution each senior is asked to
give is an easy and effective way of giving a lit -
tie bit back to the University.
Sadlv, with almost a month before gradua
tion. this year lias seen a mass pretention of the
Senior (>ift bv the Senior ('.lass. Whether this is
the result of a lack of advertising, the last-minute
writing frenz\ of theses writers, unemployed job
searchers or the efforts of the ( lass presidents,
the fact is dear: 1 his year's Senior ("lass is falling
behind in its giving.
We urge each senior to give generously to
the Senior (iilt to celebrate all the excitement
and jov of the last four years. We know se
niors have do/ens of things to do and people
to visit right now, but agreeing to support
both of these causes means choosing to give
back in a small way to the University that has
helped shape all of us.
