hoys stand below a basketball
hoop, a ball resting on the right side of the
rim, their arms stret< lied upward waiting for
the rebound. At the top of the page, in big
black letters, the words, "What could be
wrong with a casual game of basketball? Plen
ty." One line beneath: "When some people
play, it's a tragedy."
Fvery once in a while, you hear about a
basketball player collapsing on the court. For

me, I heard about a child
hood friend this year.
There was a group of us
that went to the same
sports (amp in Southern
(lalifornia tor many of our
early childhood summers.
Fellow columnist Josh
Fried was there. I was
there. Some friends that.

And.i kid named (iasey was there.
Some of us kept in touch, some of us would
catch up only when we ran into each other.

The call was completely unexpected.
C.asev, who had been attending llrown I ni
versity, collapsed while playing basketball
with a friend, also a former tamper. Casey
died right then and there. There had been no
indication that lie was ill. I here had not been
hints that this was coming.
The advertisement in the magazine, paid
for by the National Marfan Foundation, is an
attempt to promote awareness of Marfan
Syndrome. It's a rare condition, but if undi
agnosed, it can be fatal. What makes it so
dangerous is that some of the characteristics
that make one fit for basketball — long
arms, unusually long lower half of the body,
long fingers — are some of the very symp
toms of the syndrome. Furthermore, there is
110 specific test for Marfan, making it often
difficult to diagnose.
In IMH, the Northern California chapter
of the National Marfan Foundation urged
Stanford to create a specialized care center for
the western United States. Dr. I). Craig Miller
did this, and now there is a plate on campus
(ailed the "Stanford University Center for
Marfan Syndrome and Related Connective
Tissue Disorders."
Essentially, the syndrome is a genetic dis
order of connective tissues, and can affect the
bones, joints, eyes, major blood vessels and,
most seriously, the heart. It can widen the
walls of the aorta, which causes it to enlarge,
tear or rupture. The National Marfan Foun

dation estimates that some "200,000 people m
the I nited States have the Marfan syndrome
or a related connective tissue disorder.'
1 hose are the ones that know about it.
While most cases of Marfan Svndrome are
inherited — a parent with the disorder has a
50 percent chance of passing it on to a
child — almost one in four < ases arise from a
genetii mutation, Dr. |av Siwek of (George
town Medical Center wrote in an article tin
the Washington Post.
Other symptoms to watch lot include a
curvature of the spine, a chest bone that
curves inward or outward, flat feet, a back
ward < urve of the legs at the knees and neai -
sightedness. Not all symptoms are present in
ever) case. ()ften, a patient lias a combination
of a few of these.
If diagnosed, regular examinations and
dose monitoring (an help save a patient's life.
Careful medical management can lengthen
the lite span of the patient. Right now, how
ever, there is not lire tor Marfan Svndrome.
Knter Stanford.
In addition to working with patients, the
I Diversity is conducting genetic moleculai
research in an attempt to understand the
syndrome better.
"We are involved in studying families in
order to identify genetic changes that are
thought to give rise to the Marfan Svn
drome and other related heritable disor
ders of connective tissue," the Web site for
the Stanford center explains. "Participation
in the various research projects involves
meeting specific criteria, the taking of tissue
samples (skin, blood) and / or having spe
cial tests performed."
I don't know if Casey had Marfan Svn
drome. There are other heart complications
that have struck young athletes who were
thought to be in good physical condition.
Loyal Maryniount's 11, ink (lathers died on
the court. Boston Celtic Reggie Lewis died
on the court. Both died of different heart-re
lated problems.
But I do know that, in 1080, American
volleyball star Flo Hyman collapsed and
died of Marfan Syndrome while playing a
volleyball game in a Japanese league. I do
know th.it my friend Casey met some of the
physical descriptions that are called symp
toms of this disease. And I do know that
those doing research here, those trying to
learn more about Marfan, are doing some
thing for Casey's family. They are doing
something to prevent more families from
experiencing the excruciating pain of losing
a loved one so unexpectedly.
