I'he 30lh annual Stanford Powwow
and Indian Art Market took place this
weekend at the Fucal\ plus (irove, .it the
corner of Campus Drive .md Calvez
Street. I he powwow featured tradition
al Native American dancing, drumming,
singing and approximately 100 arts and
c rafts, food and information stands.
I he Stanford Powwow is one of the
three largest on the West Coast, along
side those held in Orange Countv and
White Swan, Wash. Willi 50,000 Native
American residents, the Bay Area has the
second largest Native American popula
tion in California, after Los Angeles.
"Every college in the Bay Area lias a
powwow, said sophomore Molly
fuentes, a Warm Springs Wasco tribe
member and volunteer co-coordinator
for this year's powwow. "It's important
that Stanford 1 las one. Stanford's is the
biggest."
Joe Perdiguerra, a Shawnee tribe
member, said, "You get more advertis

ing when it's on a university. I he Stan
ford powwow stands out."
I he annual powwow is Stanford's
largest multicultural event and the
largest student-run powwow iu the Unit
ed Slates. A (ore team of 25 students
planned the event. I'hey raised
$100,000, and I niversit\ funds do not
contribute to the event.
"It's Inn to help put on a really big
event.it Stanford," Fuentes said. "It can
be stressful and Irving, but it's reward
ing. A lot of people volunteered to help
out. Ii in.ikes me reallv happ\ to see peo
ple volunteering."
I losicd In the Stanford American In
dian ()rgani/ation, the powwow's theme
was "Stand and light. Resist, Fducate
and Reclaim." I lie theme honors the ef
forts of past generations to maintain Na
tive American culture and encourages
future generations to do so.
More than MOOol the nation s best Na
tive American dancers competed at the
powwow. I he winners were awarded
prize nionex. I )ant es iiu luded the grass,
chicken, straight, traditional and jingle

dances. More recent dames were also
represented, such as the women's fancy
shawl, which started with the women's
rights movements in the past centurv.
There was also Hawaiian dancing and
live-kilometer and one-mile runs.
"You know [dancing] is something
spiritual," Greg Red T.lk, a Lakota tribe
member, said. "You know that you're
doing something that's tight, feeling
what you need to tee I. It's powerful.
Dancing is like medicine."
Perdiguerra emphasized how the
powwow brought different tribes togeth
er. " These aren't tribal dances," he said.
" They're powwow dances. They're
made for all tribes to get together. It's
not made for individual tribes. I 've been
coming here since I can remember. It
brings people from everywhere. There's
always good dancing and good singing."
At least 200 Native American tribes
were represented, including the Penin
sula's native inhabitants, the Muwekma
()hlone tribe. "We get to learn different
perspectives on how we look at our spir
ituality," Reef T.lk said. "Your'valuesgive
you power tor only the good things. It's
a learning experience."
Tor many, the event is above all a so
cial gathering. "What 1 like the best is
that you get to see all your friends," Red
T.lk said. "1 really enjoy it; you meet lots
of new people."
"1 like dancing, visiting with friends,
socializing. It gives you confidence to be
out there dancing with people," Celia
Red Bird, also a Lakota tribe member,
said.
I'owwows began nearly 200 years ago
in celebration of the achievements of a
tribe or individual. Despite the fact that
many Native Americans have left their
reservations, the powwow tradition con
tinues as a gathering and celebration of
Nati\e American "culture. "Kvery week

Dancing is like medicine."
Perdiguerra emphasized how the
powwow brought different tribes togeth
er. " These aren't tribal dances," he said.
" They're powwow dances. They're
made for all tribes to get together. It's
not made for individual tribes. I 've been
coming here since I can remember. It
brings people from everywhere. There's
always good dancing and good singing."
At least 200 Native American tribes
were represented, including the Penin
sula's native inhabitants, the Muwekma
