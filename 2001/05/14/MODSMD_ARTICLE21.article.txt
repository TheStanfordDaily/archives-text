Discussion facilitator a 'total and

VVitli .1 masterful movie fresh m my
mind. 1 s.it anxiously awaiting the en

called "Spoils, Race and the Media." It
never came.
KZSU alumnus Michael Collin's
film entitled "I lank Aaron — ('.basing
.1 Dream," documenting the numer
ous racial trials and tribulations of
Aaron's chase aftci Mabe Ruth's home
run record, is a thought-provoking
look .it race relations in the I'nited
Stales through the medium of base
ball. It is an excellentc hoice as the cen
terpiece of a (list ussion. Paired with a
top-flight discussion mediator, the
stage would be set for an enjoyable and
enlightening evening. Chat, however,
was not the case.
Instead, the discussion "facilitator"
hampered it. I lis questions were lack
ing in preparation, journalistic ability
and intellectual strength. He was an
utter and total disappointment.
Compounding my frustration was
the mysterious absence of three adver
tised panelists: Dusty Baker, I ara Van-
Derveet and Herb Scanncll (the chief
executive officer of Nickelodeon) were
not in attendance after being touted as
guests. It is pointless to lay blame for
their absence, but it must be men
tioned. If not for football coach Tyrone

Willingham's impressive presence, I be
<lis< ussion might have been a tot.il loss.
Speaking to Willingham face to fine
my sophomore year at I oyon I lall re
mains one of the highlights of mv Stan
ford experience He is simply one of the
most impressive people I have ever
heard speak.
Most importantly, he makes me
proud to be a Stanford student and
spoils fan. 1 can assuredly sav that Ath

parted earlv from the discussion —
.ind I can't say I blame liim — made
the best move of liis career when lie
hired Willingham. Without linn on the

With liim. it was just disappointing.

Marguerite service should use
environmentally sound vehicles
Stanford deserves credit for invest
ment in public transportation that has
reduced congestion on campus and on
local roads. However, it has come at a
substantial cost. Stanford's Marguerite
buses are powered by dirty diesel en
gines. They fill the air along Sen a Mall
and Campus Drive with plumes of car
cinogenic fumes and soot.

Both of these roads are heavily
traveled by bike commuters who are
breathing heavily as they propel
themselves along these roads. It isdif
ficult to complete my bike commute
without ending up with a bus in front
of me, blowing several cubic meters
of sooty exhaust directly at my face. I
am ( ertainly not the only one subject
ed to this.
I he Marguerite buses produce
roughly 10 times as much pollution as if
.ill of their riders drove in separate cars.
Diesel soot is ;i known carcinogen that is
unambiguously linked to cancer and
respiratory disease.
I urge the University to replace
the Marguerite buses with clean ve
hicles that use clean-burning diesel,
natural gas or propane. Because the
Marguerite is outsourced, this
should be no more difficult than
finding another contractor. It is very
unfortunate that Stanford has cho
sen a transportation option that
jeopardizes the health and increases
the cancer risk of the thousands of
bikers and pedestrians who share the
roads on campus.
Public transportation is an impor
tant resource, but it should not be al
lowed to victimize and punish those
who choose transportation options that
are more friendly to the community
and the environment.
