## Water polo upset by UCLA in NCAA finals Cardinal nets first loss of the season, falling 4-5 in the championship game 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
If only they didn't have to play UCLA this one last
time — and in the finals of the NCAA Tournament.
After defeating the Bruins four times this season,
the Stanford women's water polo team (27-1, 11-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) could not con
tinue the streak, as it fell to UCLA, 5-4, yesterday in
the NCAA finals at the Avery Aquatics Center.
In the first-ever NCAA Women's Water Polo
lournament, the Cardinal advanced to the-finals
after its 12-0 win over Brown, while the Bruins de
feated Loyola Marymount, 11-1, in its semifinal
matchup.
While this was not the finale the top-seeded Car
dinal had in mind for the season, it did become the
only team in the history of the sport to complete its
regular season undefeated. In addition, the squad
defended its MPSF title and was ranked first na
tionally throughout the entire season.
"()f course, the loss is disappointing, but it doesn't
take away from what we did this year," said freshman
and all-tournament first-team selection Brenda Villa.
"I mean, who is ever going to go undefeated a whole
regular season again. We did something special this
year, and, yeah, we didn't win, and that's what will
probably be remembered most. But people looking
back on the first ever NCAAs will still remember that
we went undefeated."
Throughout the season, the Bruins and the Car
dinal have always played tight matches. UCLA's
only losses this season came in the four regular sea
son matches it played against Stanford. The two
predominant names in women's water polo, it was
fitting the Bruins and the Cardinal should meet in
the NCAA finals.
"There really wasn't anything different about
how we played or about how they played. It was the
National ('.hampionship, so the regular season real
ly gets forgotten and doesn't matter. Both teams are
starting with a clean slate because it was a winner
take-all format. We knew coming into it that it was

going to In- .1 game to tlie end, and they came out
strong .ind responded and were ready to go," Villa
said.
In front of a sold-out c rowd that included the Stan
lord Band and the newly initiated Dollies, the squads
played a very tight and competitive match.
In a seesaw first half, the Cardinal took the first
lead with a power-plav goal by Villa. 1 he Bruins then
responded with three unanswered goals before Villa
was once again able to tincl the back of the net, .is the
match went into the break with UCLA up 3-2.
1 lie third quarter was equally tight as senior Anne-
Marie keenan scored on a 6-on-5 opportunity to
even the score at 3-3. In heartbreaking fashion, the
Bruins once again took the lead with only five seconds
remaining in the quarter to go up one.
After holding the Bruins from scoring on a man
up situation, the ('ardinal took advantage of a its next
(>-on-5 opportunitv with a goal by junior Margie l)in
geldein to tie the score at 4-4.
I lie match remained tied until UCLA's Coralie
Simmons scored with onlv 1:28 left in the game to
give the Bruins the lead and the final, 5-4.
Stanford had one final c hance with 20 seconds re
maining in the game, but the I(1IA defense was able
to hold off the ('.ardinal attack to take the victory and
its fifth national title in six years.
Against Brown on Saturday, it took the Cardinal
almost an entire quarter to score its first goal, before
the flood gates opened as the squad note bed another
I 1 scores, five of which came in the fourth quarter.
Nine of Stanford's Hi players scored in the match, as
the (.ai clinal took an impressive 30 shots on goal. The
Cardinal defense performed up to its usual standard
as it held the Bears scoreless.
Three (Cardinal players were named to all-tourna
ment teams, while UCLA's Simmons was named the
Most Valuable Player of the tournament. ()n the sec
ond team for Stanford was I )ingeldeiti, and named to
the first team were Villa, sophomore Jackie Frank
and junior Kllen Kstes.
"Yeah, we lost, but it was a great atmosphere and
was great for the sport of women's water polo. Seeing
all the fans here, seeing the- Band and the free danc
ing around, it was just great. Women's water polo
doesn't usually draw this big of a crowd, and this
match .ind this tournament at e memorable for me re
gardless of the outcome, and hopefully the sport will
keep expanding,'' Villa said.
