### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Winning a series is just not good
enough anymore.
For the c hance to capture a Pacific 10
Conference title, at least.
The No. 7 Cardinal (39-14, 14-7 I'ac
-10) won the series with Arizona (30-23,9-
12) this weekend — its first series victory
in a month — taking two of three games
against the Wildcats, hut it lost a half
game in the Pac-10 race.
Only a half-game. But it was an im
portant one.

Stanford now trails Southern Califor
nia by a game and a half heading into the
final weekend of the regular season. I he
squad now must not onlv fin us on sweep

After two wins by die Irojans this
weekend over the (lotlgars, I S( l's magic
number is three. That means that the
Trojans need a combination of three of
their own wins and three Cardinal losses
in oi der to secure at le ast a tit- for the con
ference title. US( 1 could take- care of one
of those wins today, as it completes its se
ries with Washington State.
Head coach Mark Marquess, howev
er, said he is more concerned with how
the team is playing going into tlu- post
season.
"Whether we win the league or finish

second or third, mv main touts is that
we're plaving well going into the play
offs." he said.
As lor the league race, though, the

Sophomore Ryan Gorko makes a play at home plate. The baseball team took its first series in over
four weeks of play this weekend over Arizona.
fence to tie the game at five before
junior Scott Dragicevich drove in
the go-ahead run with a single that
scored freshman Carlos Quentin.
It was Cooper's eighth home
run of tlie season, and a timely
one, considering he had missed
capitalizing on a scoring opportu
nity in the third inning when he
grounded into a double play.
"1 fell like 1 had to redeem my
self a little bit, and that's what I was
trying to do," Cooper said. "1 got
lucky and got a hold of one."
Dragicevich's game-winning
RBI wasn't the only big play that
he made to help the Cardinal sei/.e
the victory. The shortstop made a
spectacular play on the field in the
top of the eighth inning to prevent
the Wildcats from tying the game.
With a runner in scoring position,
Justyn St. ( lair grounded a ball to
Dragicevich's right, which Drag
icevich speared with one hand. 1 fe
then threw across his body to beat
St. Clair by a split second to end
the inning.
The play "didn't surprise me,
because he makes a lot of those,"

Marquess said, "lint, still, that's a
great game-saving play "
Friday night's victory was the sec
ond comeback win in three
games for the Cardinal, a statistic
that Marquess said he found es
pecially pleasing.
"We haven't had to [come
back] very much this year, so we
know that we can do that now and
with a young team that's impor
tant," he said.
If only the young Cardinal
squad could have done the same in
Saturday's game.
It's not to say that the squad
didn't have its chances. Down 4-2
in (lu- bottom of the eighth inning,
Stanford loaded the bases with no
outs before Carko flew out to short
and (hooper grounded into a dou
ble play — the fourth double play
the Cardinal suffered .til day.
Arizona added a run in the top
of the ninth that proved to be an
important one because junior
(".lit is ()'Riotdan bit a '2-RUI single
in the bottom of the ninth to cut
the Wildcat lead to 5-4. The Cardi
nal once again loaded the bases
with two outs, but Carko popped
out to the catcher to end the game.
Seeming to grasp the dire im
portance of a win following Satur
day's loss, the Cardinal stored four

runs in tlit* top of the first inning
and never looked back. Garko
drove in O'Riordan when he hit a
double up tin.' left-field line. Then,
after freshman Sain Fuld scored
on a sacrifice fly by Cooper, fresh
man Carlos Quentin blasted liis
l()th home run of the year — a
two-run shot that cleared the cen
ter-field fence.
Junior Mike Gosling (6-0) took
control of the rubber game, pick
ing up the win, giving up two
runs on two hits in six innings of
work.
The series helped prove how
important it is to have experienced
players on a team in c ruc ial games.
As one of the most "veteran" play
ers 011 the Stanford squad, ()'Rior
dan, outshincd everyone else with
his play this weekend.
The junior second baseman
went 8-for-l 1 and tallied two RBI.
1 le also scored three runs.
Of course, that's not to say that
the younger players didn't con
tribute. Freshman Sam Fuld led
the team on Sunday with a 4-tor-5
showing, while freshman Jonnv
Ash picked up a double and scored
a run. Freshman Brian 11.ill
picked up an RBI in Sunday's
game and also scored two runs in
Saturday s game.

"The juniors showed leader
ship this weekend, and the fresh
men have been doing an unbeliev
able job stepping up and playing
the wav thev know how to play, "

(VRiordan said.
The Pac-H) race isn't the only
subject on the minds of the plavers
and coaches. I lie NCAA will an
nounce the sites of this vear's re

gionals today, and Sunken Dia
mond is a very possible option.
"It would be very important.
It's alwa\ s .1 nre.it experience host
ing a regit>nal," ()'Ki< >rdan said.
