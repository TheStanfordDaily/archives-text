Six of the eight teams thai <p 1.111-

I he most notable quality of
the (lardinal's play this week was
its consistencv. Stanford was the
only team in the field that did
not have a score in the 80s all
week long.
I lowever, Rho said she believes
that the team needs to put up some
s( i >res in the 00s in order to keep up
with national powei houses Ai i/ona

Something else th.it Stanford

"We're not too worried about
the 20-stroke difference because
0111 team scores were pretty c lose
the last two (lavs,' Rho said. " I lie
first clay was the one that did it."
I lie Cardinal trailed Arizona
by I 5 strokes after the first round,
as it goi off to a slow start again by
posting a team sc ore of .'{o2. Stan
ford improved in its next two
rounds, shooting team scores of
292 and 294.
Probably the best sign for the
(iardinal this week was the emer
gence of sophomore Kim Row
ton, who pl.Mcd 111111 individually
after posting rounds of 71-70-72
(K). Rowton, who had knee
sin gci v lasi sin inner, showed that
she is in top form now that the
most important time ol the vear
lias come.
Senioi Stephanie Keevei was
the second highest finisher tbi
the (Cardinal, plac ing ninth after
rounds of 70-72-73 ( + 5). Senior
11 il.ll \ II (miicvci *<li<>l to
lie foi I (ill) |>1.1 ( e.
freshmen Angela Rho and

Kim Konwabnnpat got their first
taste of national postseason pla\
this week and seemed ready for
the challenge. Rho tied for 20th
after rounds of 75-70-78 (+!.'{),
while Konwabnnpat took HMrd
after shooting 77-78-70 (+ 15).
Six of the eight teams thai <p 1.111-
fied this weekend were Pac-10
teams, including No. Southern
California, No. l.'i Arizona Stale,
\<>. 22 UCLA and Washington.
No. 7 l ennessee placed a disap
pointing ninth and was llieonK top
10 team that failed to make il into
the c hampionship field.
I he most notable quality of
the (lardinal's play this week was
its consistencv. Stanford was the
only team in the field that did
not have a score in the 80s all
week long.
I lowever, Rho said she believes
that the team needs to put up some
s( i >res in the 00s in order to keep up
with national powei houses Ai i/ona
and I )nke at the \( IAAs.
Something else th.it Stanford
will have to contend with is the
fac 1 that inan\ of theothei teams
competing in Florida are alreach
out of s< hool.
I Ik»se teams w ill be prac lic -
ing every lioin of every day,"
Rho said. "We just have to put
in as mm h time as we can, and
how nine Ii effoi 1 we put 111 this
week will determine how we do
.11 nationals."
