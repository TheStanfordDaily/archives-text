# Ehrlich questions origin of ethics
## Prof says people neglect ethical treatment of nature 
### DURANT GIPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Paul Ehrlich, a professor in
biological sciences, addressed
the question of the origin of
human ethics l.ist Friday, saying
that ethics are not coded in our
genes.
His discussion of evolution
,ind ethics was part of the "Kthics
at Noon" series, sponsored by
the program in Ethics in Society
and held every Friday.
About 60 people were in
attendance.
"Even if the genes wanted to
control our behavior, there are
not enough [of them] to do it,"

Kin li< li said. I It* s.iid that behav
ior is iimkli more readily ex
plained "In the programming of
our brain bv our environment."
Khiiich explained that few
highet primates have a sense of
sell like humans and chim
panzees do. II one puts a mirror
in 112 ront of a territorial fish, I lu
lls 11 attacks the image, but < liiin
panzees recognize themselves in
.1 mirror.
According to Khrlich, hu
mans have addressed how tliev
treat one another, but they have
neglected ethical considerations
regarding the environment and
its impact on the future.
Khrlich said he Ix'lievcs that
humans don't discuss ethics
enough and gave tins deficiency
as one of the reasons for bis talk.
"Kvery place you look in out s<k i
etv, there arc ethical issues that
aren't addressed ver\ often, he said.
"()iir cultural evolution in the
area of technologv lias so outrun
ourt ultural evolution in the area of
ethics [that] I think it's scary,"
Khrlich said.
According to Khrlich, the
"whole idea of human races is non
sensical biologic all\. ' and the rate
of hum.in cultural evolution is

much taster than human genetic
evolution.
"It was interesting to hear a biol
ogist's opinion on the trend ol evo
lutionary biology' explaining every
thing we <lo," sophomore David
(iarfield said.
lint (larfield objected to some
points. "I think he was a little too
extreme 0111 lie other side," he said.
"He seemed to sav nothing was
constructed by gender at all."
Sophomore )oe Shapiro said he
was impressed with Khrlich's com
parison of humans with < liitn
pan/ees in terms of genetics. When

referring to the professor's "natui
vs. nurture" argument, Shapii
thought that Khrlich's book migl
be more thorough on the subject.
"It's hard to accept his argurnci
just on a few illustrative cases
Shapiro said. "You can't resolve
with just one hour or one book."
