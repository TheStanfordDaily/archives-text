# Grant allows research

### MELISANDE MIDDLETON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new Program in Human Biology en
deavor will provide financial support for
sophomores who wish to undertake <i sum
mer research project.
I his vear, 10 sophomores were awarded
the giant from Tndetgraduate Indepen
dent Study and Research in Human Biolo
gy. Their research will address a range ol
fields, including neurobiology, neuropsy
chology. immunology, cellular biology, field
work in Venezuela, infant language devel
opment and infant sih ial cognition.
The Human Biolog\ Program director,
Prof. Russell Ternald, applied to the vice
provost for undergraduate education tor
funds to support the program. Ihe office
agreed to fund the program with .t depart
mental grant for independent study and re
search. "It is part of the program to provide
more support for undergraduates who wish
to do research at Stanford, Ternald said.

I he new grant program is part of the
summei researc !i college, vvhieh takes place
on campus.
"One <>l the great advantages oi the col

Direc tor of Undergraduate Research Pro

"It's an optimum place to foster discus

search. It allows you to approach a
professor from any department in
the school."
"Our goal in Human Biology is
to increase the number of students
who do original research early in
their undergraduate education,"
Fernald said. "Faculty associated
with the Human Biology Program
who were interested in mentoring
students were matched with stu
dents who applied to the program.
At the end of the summer, the stu
dents will make brief oral presen
tations toother students and facul
ty mentors about their work."
Fernald will be one of these
mentors. "I will be a mentor for the
program and am greatly looking
forward to it,"he said. "()ne of the
great pleasures of being a faculty
member at Stanford is interacting
with undergraduates around a re
search project. Undergraduates
have the ability to ask clear ques

tions and be unafraid of tackling
complex problems. Helping stu
dents to discover early whether
they like this kind of work is fun."
Lin said th.it the program gives
students the opportunity to get to
know faculty and to be involved in
full-time research and see what it is
like.
I he college "provides students
engaged in full-time summer re
search the opportunity to live to
gether in a close intellectual and
social community," Brubaker
(lole said.
"Benefits of the college include
a substantial subsidy for room and
board, opportunities to share your
research findings with other stu
dents, special meals with profes
sors, and cultural and social excur
sions. I he college creates an ideal
balance between the intensity of
research and the need fora sup
portive, social community,"
Brubaker-( lole added.
Organizers say that the grant
gives sophomores the opportunity
to acquire research skills early on
in their Stanford career. "One of

the greatest aspects of the hum
bio's summer research program is
the fact that they've targeted
sophomores as participants,"
Brubaker-Cole said. "Students in
summer research programs like
hum bio's will not be doing cook
book science; they'll be working on
real problems with people pushing
the limits of knowledge. Students
will enter into a community of
scholars and researchers who
share their interests and mentor
them in research skills."
Human Biology Prof. Anne
Fernald called the grant a "re
search exploration award." She
said that, even early on, "it's cer
tainly possible to connect with the
lab. In the sciences where there's a
lot of bench-work, you need that
time. If you can get that kind of edu
cation under your Ix lt, then you can
do a more in-depth study."
"Gaining closely mentored,
hands-on research experience this
early in the undergraduate career
should really increase the number
of students able to undertake hon
ors projects," Brubaker-Cole said.

search. It allows you to approach a
professor from any department in
the school."
"Our goal in Human Biology is
to increase the number of students
who do original research early in
their undergraduate education,"
Fernald said. "Faculty associated
with the Human Biology Program
who were interested in mentoring
students were matched with stu
dents who applied to the program.
At the end of the summer, the stu
dents will make brief oral presen
tations toother students and facul
ty mentors about their work."
Fernald will be one of these
mentors. "I will be a mentor for the
program and am greatly looking
forward to it,"he said. "()ne of the
great pleasures of being a faculty
member at Stanford is interacting
with undergraduates around a re
search project. Undergraduates
have the ability to ask clear ques

tions and be unafraid of tackling
complex problems. Helping stu
dents to discover early whether
they like this kind of work is fun."
Lin said th.it the program gives
students the opportunity to get to
know faculty and to be involved in
full-time research and see what it is
like.
I he college "provides students
engaged in full-time summer re
search the opportunity to live to
gether in a close intellectual and
social community," Brubaker
(lole said.
"Benefits of the college include
a substantial subsidy for room and
board, opportunities to share your
research findings with other stu
dents, special meals with profes
sors, and cultural and social excur
sions. I he college creates an ideal
balance between the intensity of
research and the need fora sup
portive, social community,"
Brubaker-( lole added.
Organizers say that the grant
gives sophomores the opportunity
to acquire research skills early on
in their Stanford career. "One of

the greatest aspects of the hum
bio's summer research program is
the fact that they've targeted
sophomores as participants,"
Brubaker-Cole said. "Students in
summer research programs like
hum bio's will not be doing cook
book science; they'll be working on
real problems with people pushing
the limits of knowledge. Students
will enter into a community of
scholars and researchers who
share their interests and mentor
them in research skills."
Human Biology Prof. Anne
Fernald called the grant a "re
search exploration award." She
said that, even early on, "it's cer
tainly possible to connect with the
lab. In the sciences where there's a
lot of bench-work, you need that
time. If you can get that kind of edu
cation under your Ix lt, then you can
do a more in-depth study."
"Gaining closely mentored,
hands-on research experience this
early in the undergraduate career
should really increase the number
of students able to undertake hon
ors projects," Brubaker-Cole said.
