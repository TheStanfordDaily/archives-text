When the current Bush administration can
i eled the inaugural meeting of the National In
stitutes ol Health committee, Dr. Paul Berg, vice
president and dean of Stanford Medical School,
said lie was not surprised.
The Human Pluripotenl Stem Cell Review
(.roup committee was to review the first appli
cations from scientists seeking federal funds for
human embryo research. "The effect was the
same as I predicted," Berg said. "Reconsidering
(ilinton's approval, my guess is th.it they'll find a
way to permanently stop it."

I'he National Institutes of Health had been
moving forward with the grant approval
process because the top health and human ser
vices lawyer in the Clinton administration had
deemed such funding legal. I he research
grants for human embryo research were to be
awarded to researchers who obtained their c ells
from distributors following verv strict guidelines
for retrieving the embryonic cells.
"Within the last few months, inanv other
countries have approved embryonic stem-cell
research. Researchers in Japan, Franc e. Britain,
Canada and other countries are able to contin
ue the research," Berg said.
Meanwhile, the United States researchers

have been forc ed to halt.
Hie order, given April 21, 2001, but not yet
public K announc ed, is the most direct ac lion vet
bv Bush or his appointees in the scientific and
ethical controversy over human embryonic
stem-cell rescarc h.
I lunian embryonic cell research uses the em
bryos that are otherwise discarded .it fertility
clinics to study stem cells —cells that have the
potential to grow into all kinds of human tissues.
Berg described the process bv wliic li the em
bryonic cells are made available. I le said that, in
fertility clinics, the early embryos — after two to
three days of'the fertilization of the
egg— are still in the Fallopian
tubes. While many eggs are fertil
ized, few are implanted.
After one of the eggs is chosen
for further development, the re
mainder of the removed mother's
eggs are frozen away in case some
thing goes wrong with the chosen
egg. 1 hese frozen eggs are discard-

Ed after about five years. Embry
onic stem-cell research uses those
embryos that would otherwise be
discarded.
For the past 25 years, embryon
ic stem-cell research has employed
embryonic mouse stem cells.
Human adults also have certain
stem c ells.
"These cells, however, exist in
very limited qualities. It is not clear
whether we can grow them, and
the researchers should not be limit
ing themselves to just those cells,"
Berg said.

It the researchers become un
able to obtain federal funding, as
Berg predicts, the embryonic cell
research might not have come to ;i
complete halt.
"Commercial companies are
there who are trying to explore the
possibilities of embryonic cell re
search," Berg said. 1 lowever, these
companies are not required to
share their research results. "Scien
tists would publish their findings.
The best way to oversee what is
produced it to allow federal in
volvement."
