president and dean of Stanford Medical School,
said lie was not surprised.
The Human Pluripotenl Stem Cell Review
(.roup committee was to review the first appli

human embryo research. "The effect was the
same as I predicted," Berg said. "Reconsidering
(ilinton's approval, my guess is th.it they'll find a
way to permanently stop it."

I'he National Institutes of Health had been
moving forward with the grant approval
process because the top health and human ser

deemed such funding legal. I he research
grants for human embryo research were to be
awarded to researchers who obtained their c ells
from distributors following verv strict guidelines
for retrieving the embryonic cells.
"Within the last few months, inanv other
countries have approved embryonic stem-cell
research. Researchers in Japan, Franc e. Britain,
Canada and other countries are able to contin

Meanwhile, the United States researchers

have been forc ed to halt.
