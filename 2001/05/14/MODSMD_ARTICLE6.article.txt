### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Joseph H. Greenberg, the emeritus Ray
Lyman Wilbur Professor of Social Science died
May 7. I le was 85.
I lie cause of death was pancreatic cancer, his
wife, Selma, said in the Stanford Report.
A linguist, Greenberg's study of the similari
ties between different languages gained him
worldwide renown.

"The most remarkable thing about |oe was
the breadth of his acquaintatu e with the world's
languages," James A. Fox. an associate professoi
of anthropological sciences who had collaborat
ed with Greenberg, said in the Stanford Report.
"I don't know anyone else who had that kind of
command of linguistic types."
Greenberg's range of knowledge was unusu
al, even fora linguist. Fox pointed out. 11c used
his language ability to fix us on two sets of issues:
the structure of languages and the relationship

of languages to eat Ii other.
During the lirst veai s of his career, he studied
how languages are organized, doing pioneci ing
work in the field of typology. I ypology is ws
tem of groupings set up to aid I he classification of
languages.
(iieenherg offered a new perspective to the
field m books such as "Language I 'niversals with
Special Reference to Feature Hierarc hies.'"
"In llit' IWiOs, lit' did work that
established certain universal princi
ples <>l language structure that ex
cited the entire world," Fox said.
For example, (ireenberg found ev
idence that even language that
contains nasali/cd vowels also ion
tains non-nasali/cd vowels in an
equal or greater number.
He also corresponded with in
ternational scholars Irving to piece
together the rules of language or
ganization.
(ireenberg attempted to disc ov
er the common origins of language:
(ion Id all languages be shown to de
rive from a handful ol common
roots? He classified languages into
families, filling do/ens of notebooks
with different words (<>i the same
thing. I le began with Africa.
(ireenberg determined that

there are four basic groups of
African languages. Many scholars
accepted this work, Fox said,
(.reenberg published "languages
of Africa" in 1963.
(ireenberg conducted the same
studv of the Americas, but many
specialists opposed Ins woi k. I „itcr,
researc hers( laimed that theie were
three groups of Native American
languages, supporting (ireenlxi g's
original theory.
Recently, (ireenberg attempted
to prove the links between what he
called "Kurasiatic" languages. I le
said be believed that most of the
languages of F.uropc and Asia,
i.inging from I uglisli to Korean,
had common threads.
Fox recalls (irccnlierg's dedicat
ed sc holai ship. " I be whole point of
Ins work \%as he had to pic k out of
the shelves .1 book on some lan
guage and take copious notes on its
structure and vocahularv." he said
111 the Stanford Report. "He bad to
be near the books."
