A linguist, Greenberg's study of the similari
ties between different languages gained him

"The most remarkable thing about |oe was
the breadth of his acquaintatu e with the world's
languages," James A. Fox. an associate professoi
of anthropological sciences who had collaborat
ed with Greenberg, said in the Stanford Report.
"I don't know anyone else who had that kind of
command of linguistic types."
Greenberg's range of knowledge was unusu
al, even fora linguist. Fox pointed out. 11c used
his language ability to fix us on two sets of issues:
the structure of languages and the relationship

of languages to eat Ii other.
During the lirst veai s of his career, he studied
how languages are organized, doing pioneci ing
work in the field of typology. I ypology is ws
tem of groupings set up to aid I he classification of
languages.
(iieenherg offered a new perspective to the
field m books such as "Language I 'niversals with
Special Reference to Feature Hierarc hies.'"
