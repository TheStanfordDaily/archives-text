about admissions requirements.
" Probably without basis but alarming even as an
unsubstantiated rumor is the report current on the
campus lately that the administration may in the
near Inline lower entrance requirements.
"li has been impossible to track down the rumor
or to find anv creditable basis for the hint that the
financial bugaboo is behind it. Two recent admin
istrative acts have been prompted by economic
stringencies.

many possible entrants would not consider paying
the much higher tuition fees."
Bottom line: What a different worid we live in today — ad
missions gets harder every year.
