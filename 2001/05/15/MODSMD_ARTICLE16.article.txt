Foundation will give $4.3 million over the next
six years to lund the Kast I'alo Alto projec I and
similar neighborhood improvement initiatives

Ihe Peninsula Community Foundation

based organization, and the I la.is (lenter.
Although the initiative stalled 111 1999,
participants have already seen much
progress, particularly in communit\ mem
bers' increased solidarity and commitment.
Over 140 Kast Palo Alto residents regularh
attend weekly meetings to disi uss program
goals, dedicating an estimated I,."> 00 hours ol
their time between meetings and individual
research on local issues.
"()ne ol the really exciting elements of the
project is that, for six months even I uesda\
night, communit\ members have met to dis
cuss what they want," said Peninsula ( oinmu

ilits Fund Communications Director Debbie
Kor(l-S( i iba. "It's a neighborhood-driven revi
tali/ation program. < )ui role is merely to find
out wli.it is important (o them."
Initiative Director Mario Paz said he agrees.
" There's been an incredible increase ot civic
engagement with the project," he said. "A lot
ol tbi us h.is Ih-cii on gelling people involved in
their commnnit\ development and develop
ing the <apacit\ ol local organizations to im
prove the community."

project, .ind so 1 1 ie\ re more motivated to
support it." s.iid Cari Pang, the initiative co
ordinatoi .it the I la.is (ienter. "()ne ot the big
problems with neighborhood improvement
initiatives ovei the past veai s is
that often these projects come
and go, and communit\ residents
feel like the\ don't have an\ con
trol over what happens. I here's a
lot of inone\ put into programs
which latei disappear because
they are not sustained. . . . I lie
hope is that this will organi/e the
communitv better, bridging the
gap between politv and the tl.i\-

io-<la\ lilt* of residents.''
Itii committees will imple
ment llie initiati\e by overseeing
10 projects in economics, health

"( )iic ol the highest benefits si u

the (ommimitv has a hand in what
the foe us of that resean h will be,"
I'ang said.
I'a/ stressed that the data will
be used dircctlv to improve the
conununitv, in contrast to tradi

ple who gel evaluated are the last
to know the results ol their evalu
ation. Reports are made, and as

sumptions are made, but the peo
ple ol whom assumptions are
made have no savin the process.
I hese reports then end up un

I'alo Alio residents.

"Students will have the experi

project .ind collecting inlorma
tion. I In-I niversitv and the com
innnitv can work together and
pull on each other's strengths."
