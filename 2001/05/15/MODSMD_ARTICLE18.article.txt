## The
						Stanford Daily Draw would benefit from tiers, uniformity

Published Since IS91

II (.()KS WI I HOl I saying that May is stress
ful lot all freshmen, sophomores and juniors,
.iikl largely lor one reason: Draw. Freshmen
snuggle to determine the group <>l friends they
will live with for the next year and. perhaps more im
portantly, where the\ will live. Meanwhile, sopho
mores and juniors enter the Draw with either high or
low expectations. Will thev, like thev have in the past,
draw extremelv well?
Or will they, lor the third year in a row, receive a
number that < anonh lead to Wilbui 11.ill? We all know
those who seem to draw consistent.lv poorly or well.
Add priority — the system through whit h students can
applv to be accepted into a dormitory or house before
others, often regardless ol theii number — into the
mix, and vou've got a svsteni that is, at best, inconsis
tent, and <it worst, unfair.
I lie I Diversity has long considered implementing
a three-tier I )ra\\ system, so all students would have a
chance to draw from I to 999, 1,000 to 1.999 and, in
theii unprelei red year, from 2,000 to 3,000. I his mea
sure, along with a revamping ol the t in rent priority
svsteni, would be a great stai I.it making the I h aw a less
painful process.

It is obvious that any system that undertakes the task
ofassigning students choice or not-so-desirable housing
will be the target of much criticism. But students receive
Draw numbers randomly, which, in theory, should
imply some sort of fairness. I nfortunately, out of this
randomness emerges groups w ho have the bad luck of
drawing poorly repeatedly, l or instance, .i group en
tering the Draw normally in two preferred years and
one unpreferrcd year could draw 1,985, 2,995 and
1,800. Such numbers w ill surely see them wind up in
Stern I lall or Wilbur year after year. While one could
argue that at least these students have glial anteed hous
ing — unlike other college students, including our
friends a< rossthe Kav — this is troubling in light of the
fact that there will be anothei group, equal in every
other aspect, that continuously draws well and spends
three years on the Row. It is difficult to argue against the
three-tier svsteni, as it would give students a I letter
chance at receiving desirable housing for at least one of
their lour years at the I niversitv.
I he priority svsteni is another questionable Draw
structure. Receiving priority allows students with an
expressed interest in an area to have a better chance
at living in a house that focuses on that area. For ex

ample, a violinist might apply for priority in Kimball
Hall, which has a performing arts theme. Similarly,
students can apply for priority in ethnic theme dor
mitories, in most cases promising to put on a theme
event for the dormitory at some point during the year.
For students who draw poorly, priority offers a chance
at still receiving the housing of their choice, and, for
that reason, the system has some merit.
However, applying for and meeting the require
ments of priority is terribly inconsistent fioin dormi
tory to dormitory. Kimball receives well over 100 ap
plit ations to fill 00 priority spots, and therefore has a
rigorous selection system involving multiple essays,
showcasing one's talents and committing to listing the
dormitory first on the housing preference list. Mean
while, those interested in some of the other theme
dormitories merely have to sign up on a list for prior
ity. 1 here is a tremendous discrepancy here. Students
should not have to jump through hoops, but some ef
fort should he made to demonstrate interest in the res
idence theme. However, because no consistent Uni
versity-wide system exists, some talented students are
left behind, while others seeking singles just sign up
and are on their way. Many, understandably, are left

questioning the point ol priority.
This could be remedied with just a little time and ef
fort. Perhaps there should he a general priority hous
ing application focusing on the level ol involvement
and willingness to commit. Beyond this, each house
c ould add one or two questions pertaining to its specif
ic theme. This will limit the stress students face, while at
the same time providing a system thorough enough to
assess true enthusiasm. Most importantly, a common
application will, like the three-tier Draw system, place
everyone on more equal ground. Students who just
want priority lor a better room and have no interest in
the theme should be weeded out. It is,is simple as that.
It is important to remember that, in the eyes of
some, Draw will never be an entirely fait process,
l'liere will always be those who feel slighted. But it is
essential that I lousing Services make some effort to
improve the system. By going ahead with the three
tier proposal <md cleaning up the priority process, the
I diversity can demonstrate its commitment to re
sponding to students' frustrations. The Draw group
that would have drawn 2,995,1,985 and 1.800 — and
those who attest to the inconsistencies of priority —
will be tremendously thankful.
