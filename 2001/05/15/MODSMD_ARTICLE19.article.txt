# DEEP IN LEFT FIELD
## Mopping and learning 
### 
r ■ 1 here are lots of esoteric, compli( ated
things that Stanlord students know:
how DNA is translated into RNA and
.M . back again, how a Supreme (lout I de
cision (an ailed legislation and public opinion,
how to program a robot to pla\ basketball. Hut
there are also a lot ol realh simple tilings Ill.lt
Stanlord students don't know: how to read .1 bus

schedule, how to li\ a ( logged .1
toilet, how to (lean a kilt hen.
(iatlier around, boys and girls.
Let me tell you the storv ol Stan
ford student who didn't know
how to use .1 mop.
I his was a guv I got to know
pretty well when we lived in the
same Row house last vear. Kvcrv
one could tell that he c ame from

a familx that didn't require him to help out too
much with main ( horcs around the house, such
as cooking and (leaning.
I le arrived at college and was suddenly on Ins
own. I .i\ 1 tig m .1 doi 111 1 ne, 1111 111,11 there was no one
lo do Ins ( bores anymore. He did Ins own latindrv
and vacuumed Ins own room on .1 regular basis,
and ii wasn't thai bad. 111 a way, he fell good know
ing that he was able to lake (are ol himself. I leeveii
taught a couple ol his dormmates how to dean a
lint trap on a di ver and fix the bell on the vacuum
brush.
In his junior veai. he moved into a Row house
and faced a daunting new situation: hashing. For
him, and for c< unit less other Stanford undergrad
uates, living in a Row house was all about the good
lood. Who knew anything about hashing? 1 le was
under the ratliei loolish impression thai he'd only
have to wash a lew dishes every once in a while,
and he knew how lo do that.
Boy, was he ever wrong. Hashing was more
than just washing dishes; ii was scrubbing down
grimy pots and pans, sc raping the charred mass
es oil the grill, sweeping ci limbs up ofl the dining
room Hoot , emptying the grease trap, washing
the stove plates, lugging trash out lo the Dunip
ster, cleaning out the fridge and mopping the
lloor. Hashing meant spending about an hour <1
week and an additional two hours per quarter
sweating lo get the kite hen spic and span.
Our pampered little luetic! didn't know how to
do most of that siull. Ii looked like he was going to
have to learn how to do it, and 10 do it well. While lie
might have been the kid who was never forced to
clean at home, he certainly wasn't the kid to make

lilt' rest ol his hashing crew pick 11| > his slat k.
M.m\ people in the house had ik yci cleaned
anything belbre, and n showed. I hey dreaded
hashing, the\ didn't show up on lime and ilic\
frequently did a shoddy job. I he guv I'm talking
ahoui could easily have lallen into tli.it category,
hut he didn't. As he got into the swing ol things,
he began to think ol hashing dillerenil).
Was he smart enough to get into Stanford?
Yep. Would Ins Stanford degree grant him man)
opportunities that wouldn't be available to him
otherwise? Sure. Was Stanford going to teach him
how to use a mop? Absolutely not. It would have
been convenient for him to do the eas\ hash jobs
.ind let the lolks around him do the harder stuff.
Km then lie si ill wouldn't know how lo mop, and,
i<> him, tli.it was ridiculous.
Hashing turned from .1 ( bore into a learning
experience and a lesson in social responsibility.
I lie former because 11 taught him how much
work was required 10 keep the house running —
work he had never seen because he'd never had
to do ii before. Ii was .1 lesson in social responsi
bility because a quick and ellec live hash required
111.11 every single person show up 011 time and do
a damn good job, or else the health inspector
might chop by and shut the kite hen down.
I low absurd is ii that we can graduate from this
university and have no idea how to do simple
tasks? Ii would be easy to live your entire lilt* with
out performing those "menial" chores that — de
spite your education — are .1 little intimidating.
You could just leave those jobs lor someone else,
or pretend that those jobs are beneath you. a bril
liant Stanford student.
Don't do it. No matter how many degrees you
earn from different institutions, if you can't do
simple tasks sue h as c hanging a lire or ironing a
shirt, you're lacking some important lile skills.
I hat kid who lived in the Row house with me
look what many people believed was a dreadful
job, and, alter a year in the house, walked away
with some important skills and an entirely new
ethic about chores. His outlook on lile was
c hanged bv the experience. Some of you might
tlntik I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. I ought to
know — bee ause Ihe kid who didn't know how to
use a mop was me.

r ■ 1 here are lots of esoteric, compli( ated
things that Stanlord students know:
how DNA is translated into RNA and
.M . back again, how a Supreme (lout I de
cision (an ailed legislation and public opinion,
how to program a robot to pla\ basketball. Hut
there are also a lot ol realh simple tilings Ill.lt
Stanlord students don't know: how to read .1 bus

schedule, how to li\ a ( logged .1
toilet, how to (lean a kilt hen.
(iatlier around, boys and girls.
Let me tell you the storv ol Stan
ford student who didn't know
how to use .1 mop.
I his was a guv I got to know
pretty well when we lived in the
same Row house last vear. Kvcrv
one could tell that he c ame from

a familx that didn't require him to help out too
much with main ( horcs around the house, such
as cooking and (leaning.
I le arrived at college and was suddenly on Ins
own. I .i\ 1 tig m .1 doi 111 1 ne, 1111 111,11 there was no one
lo do Ins ( bores anymore. He did Ins own latindrv
and vacuumed Ins own room on .1 regular basis,
and ii wasn't thai bad. 111 a way, he fell good know
ing that he was able to lake (are ol himself. I leeveii
taught a couple ol his dormmates how to dean a
lint trap on a di ver and fix the bell on the vacuum
brush.
In his junior veai. he moved into a Row house
and faced a daunting new situation: hashing. For
him, and for c< unit less other Stanford undergrad
uates, living in a Row house was all about the good
lood. Who knew anything about hashing? 1 le was
under the ratliei loolish impression thai he'd only
have to wash a lew dishes every once in a while,
and he knew how lo do that.
Boy, was he ever wrong. Hashing was more
than just washing dishes; ii was scrubbing down
grimy pots and pans, sc raping the charred mass
es oil the grill, sweeping ci limbs up ofl the dining
room Hoot , emptying the grease trap, washing
the stove plates, lugging trash out lo the Dunip
ster, cleaning out the fridge and mopping the
lloor. Hashing meant spending about an hour <1
week and an additional two hours per quarter
sweating lo get the kite hen spic and span.
Our pampered little luetic! didn't know how to
do most of that siull. Ii looked like he was going to
have to learn how to do it, and 10 do it well. While lie
might have been the kid who was never forced to
clean at home, he certainly wasn't the kid to make

lilt' rest ol his hashing crew pick 11| > his slat k.
M.m\ people in the house had ik yci cleaned
anything belbre, and n showed. I hey dreaded
hashing, the\ didn't show up on lime and ilic\
frequently did a shoddy job. I he guv I'm talking
ahoui could easily have lallen into tli.it category,
hut he didn't. As he got into the swing ol things,
he began to think ol hashing dillerenil).
Was he smart enough to get into Stanford?
Yep. Would Ins Stanford degree grant him man)
opportunities that wouldn't be available to him
otherwise? Sure. Was Stanford going to teach him
how to use a mop? Absolutely not. It would have
been convenient for him to do the eas\ hash jobs
.ind let the lolks around him do the harder stuff.
Km then lie si ill wouldn't know how lo mop, and,
i<> him, tli.it was ridiculous.
