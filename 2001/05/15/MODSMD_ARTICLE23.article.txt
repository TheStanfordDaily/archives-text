PHILADELPHIA (AP)
Promising to be a "determined
adversary" to gun violence, Pres
ident Ceorge \V. lUisli an
nounced plans Monday to mobi
lize federal and local prosecutors
who will locus exclusively on
gun-related crimes.
I he president unveiled bis
proposal at a police promotion
c eremony as part of National Po
lite Week. He said the violent
crime rate in the I'nited States
dec lined by 20 percent between
1989 and 1999 but still remains
too high; 12,(>58 people were
murdered in the I nitecl States in
1999, two-thirds of them by
firearms.
"For every fatal shooting,
time- are roughly three nonfatal
shootings. Folks, litis is unaccept
able in America." Bush said.
"We're going to do something
about it."
W itli do/ens ol uniformed po
lice officers assembled behind
him on a riser, Bush said lie will
launch "Project Sale Neighbor
hoods," a two-vear, $550 million
effort that involves hiring 1 IS
new assistant I.S. attorneys and
(>OO state and local prosecutors to
work with police agencies and
community groups on gun cases.

"ft will send an unmistakable
message: If you use a gun illegal
ly, you will do hard time," Bush
said. "We're going to reduce gun
violence in America, and those
whocommit crimes with guns will
find a determined adversary in
my administration."
Monday's trip was the presi
dent's third to Pennsylvania, a
swing slate that went narrowly to
former Vice President Al Core
last November. Bush will travel to
the st.lie again on Friday to pro
mote his national energy strategy.
Bush got .i hearty embrace
from Philadelphia's Democratic
mavor, |ohn Street, and was
joined by members of the slate's
congressional delegation, includ
ing Republican Reps. Curt \\ el
don and Pat Fooinev and Demo
cratic Rep. |<>e I loeflel.
I he president noted that Wcl
don, I loeflel and looiney were
returning to Washington willi
him aboard Air Force One and
joked. "I look forward to listening
to what you need to tell me. 1
probablv won I do it.
1 he political overtones of
Bush's lough-on-criine posture
did not go umiotic ed l>y gun con
trol advocates. One group, Ar
lington, \ a.-based Americans for

(iun Safety, aired 60-second
radio ;uls in Philadelphia on
Mondav urging Bush to support
mandators bat kground checks
tor i nstoinersat gun shows, and a
coalition ot other groups called
on him i<> sign several new gun
control laws.
"Felons in \YI states can get
guns .it gun shows with no ques
tions asked, and resell them on
our streets," the radio spot said.
"That's why we need a national
law requiring background checks
at all gun shows."
Hush's plan also calls tor $44
million to improve criminal
record-keeping so convicts can
not legally buy guns; nearly $29
million to expand ballistics testing
so illegal guns and ammunition
can be tra< ed; $19 million for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms tor a youth gun inter
diction initiative.
"In America today, a teen-ager
is more likely to die from a gun
shot ill.in from .ill natural causes
of death combined," Bush said.
" I liese details have caused too
man) families to bury the next
generation. And for all our chil
dren's sake, this nation must re
claim our neighborhoods and
our streets."
