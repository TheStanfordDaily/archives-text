## Arafat condemns death of Palestinian policemen as "assassinations" 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli
troops killed five Palestinian po
licemen in the West Bank and
rocketed security targets in the
Gaza Strip yesterday — part of an
emerging strategy of taking the of
fensive against Palestinian security
forces, rather than retaliating for
specific attacks.
I he rocket attack in Gaza tar
geted a small armored force of the
Palestinian police, and Palestinians
said 10 vehicles were destroyed.
In previous Gaza raids, Israeli
troops razed dozens of Palestinian
police buildings, including ammu
nitions depots, food warehouses,
mosques and carpentry shops affil
iated with the security forces.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said the Israeli attacks were aimed
at demoralizing the Palestinians
and insisted his people "cannot he
shaken." He denounced the
killings of the policemen as "assas
sinations."
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon said he had implored
Arafat in recent weeks to "act

against the perpetrators of terror."
"If he doesn't take these steps,
then we will have to take these
steps," Sharon said. "We don't
have any other choice."
Sharon adviser kaanan Gissin
said the Palestinian Authority lias
been warned repeatedly that Israel
would not tolerate the involve
ment of Palestinian security forces
in attacks on Israelis.
"The Israeli Defense Forces has
derided, with the approval of the
government, to take initiated ac
tion . . . against those targets from
where such attacks are being con
ducted," Gissin said.
Over almost eight months of
steadily escalating hostilities. Israel
has wrestled with how harshly to
hit back against the Palestinian
forces it helped set up during the
1990s autonomy accords. Actions
were generally described as reac -
tions or retributions against specif
ic militants.
In the West Bank violence, the
Palestinian officers, ages 17 to 29,
were shot in the head and chest he
lore dawn yesterday while man
ning a small police outpost near
the town of Ramallah, Palestinian
officials said. Several bullets tore
through the barrack walls.
It was the bloodiest single inci

dt ni since Feb. 14, when eight Is
raelis were killed by a Palestinian
who crashed his bus into a crowd
near Tel Aviv.
(>issin said Israeli soldiers were
responding to tire hut admitted
that the live Palestinian officers
killed may not have been the ones
shooting. "They could have re
in.lined alive it they had been the
ones stopping terrorism instead of
taking part in it,"he said.
In the (la/a Strip, Israeli heli
copters and navv gunboats shelled
security installations, including a
compound of the Force 17 security
service, a polite building and the
offices of Arafat's Fatah move
ment. Four people were injured In
shrapnel and one suffered from
shock, doctors said.
Israeli hard-liners, including
Sharon, had long argued that Is
rael erred in permitting the estab
lishment of the Palestinian securitv
fortes. And Israel has charged that
the forces are much larger than
permitted bv the agreements and
are using weapons they are not al
lowed to have.
Still, until the fighting erupted
last fall, cooperation between Is
raeli and Palestinian security was
generally good and sometimes
even comradely.

hi October, when Israel first at
tacked Palestinian installations —
in retaliation for the lynching of
two reserve soldiers in the West
Bank town of Ramallah — it gave
warning to avoid casualties.
Since then, Palestinian forces

have openly participated in shoot
ing incidents and .1 militia affiliated
with Arafat known as the Tan/.im
lias been at the forefront of some.
The Palestinian police "have to
he attacked so we (.111 protect our
people," Israeli Kducation Minis

ter Limor Livnat said yesterday.
Palestinian Information Minis
ter Yasser Abed Rabbo called the
Israeli attack on the five policemen
a "premeditated, cold-blooded
murder" and said no gunfire came
