As the Pacific 10 (Conference
and NC.AA CI ham pionships
loom, Stanford's athletes are ris
ing to the challenge with record
performances.
At Sunday's (Cardinal Qualifier
on CCobh Track, junior Gabe Jen
nings and senior Michael Stem
ber. Olympians in the 2000 Syd
ney Games, finished one and two
in the 800 meters with automatic
NGAA qualifying times. On the
other side ol the Bay, sophomore
Jason Golf turned in a strong
provisional qualifying perfor
mance in the decathlon at the
Pac-1 0 Multi-event Chatnpi
onships in Berkeley.
Provisional marks from Golf,
senior Ryan Carroll in the 800
meters and sophomore Jesse
Thomas in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase — .ill of whom
recorded career bests this week
end — do not necessarily guaran
tee them spots in the NCAA
Championships. However, if this
weekend's meets were any indica
tion, Stanford is performing at
the highest level it has all year
and is ready for the season-end
ing meets.
"There were some tremen
dous things done at this meet,''
said associate head coach Robert
Weir. "Our athletes are arriving
at their peaks. I think we will see
some outstanding performances
at Pac-10s."
I he Pac-10 meet, to be held
next weekend at (California's Ed
wards Stadium, will provide an
opportunity for provisional qual
ifiers to better their marks and
secure spots in the NC.AA Cham

pionships. I he NC.YXs will Mart
