ing. the Stanford men's crew team returned
home from l*ike Natoma in Sacramento
this weekend confident that n had achieved
one of its main goals for the season.
Racing against .1 trio of schools filled with
scholarship rowers, the varsity eight squad
took home a fourth-place finish .it the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships with a
lime of 0 minutes, 15.20 seconds. Stanford
pushed hard, falling only to powerhouses
No. 1 California, No. 5 Washington, and
No. <S ()regon State. l'('-Davis and Western
Washington made good 011 their promise to
push the Pac-10 teams as UC-Davis fell to
Stanford after .1 close race (0:10.35).

that Cal has taken home the Pac-10 title, but
all of the schools fared well in the competi
tion. Stanford was extremely successful
within schools of similar build, coming in
first among teams without scholarship re
cruits on their squads.

"We worked <1 lot on the first 1000 meters
of the race. This gave us a good c hance to
work on the- first half of the race — figure
out what we had at the start and figure out if
we were going to be able to make strategic
moves at the 500 mark, the 700 mark and
again at the 1000 mark."
