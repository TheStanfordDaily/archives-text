lime of 0 minutes, 15.20 seconds. Stanford

No. 1 California, No. 5 Washington, and
No. <S ()regon State. l'('-Davis and Western
Washington made good 011 their promise to
push the Pac-10 teams as UC-Davis fell to
Stanford after .1 close race (0:10.35).

that Cal has taken home the Pac-10 title, but
