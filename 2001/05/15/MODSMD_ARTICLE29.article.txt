I "lit* favorite lor the Pacific 10 Conference hep
tathlon crown shifted as quickly <is ilit* winds blow

weekend's Pac-10 Multi-Events ('.hampionship, the
first event of the conference championships th.it

Seems the changes in the winds, whit li Ibrced of
ficials to reconsider the directions in which races
would he run. blew towards the unexpected.
Sin prise No. I: UCLA senior Michelle Perry, al
ready owner of a N( IAA automatic qualifying total,
opted to sit out the Pac-10 meet and give up her role
as the heavy favorite for the title.
Without Perry at the front, Washington State
stat Whitney Evans, second in the conference going
into the meet, stepped unassumingly into the lead
after the first day.
Surprise No. 2: Stanford's Julie I inker leaped a
career-best 5 leet, 10 inches, to move into second
place after day one, trailing Evans by just I3 points.
I he senioi seemed primed for her best event, the
long jump, the next day and in good position to
challenge for the win.
Even with l inker breathing down Iter neck,
Kvans, who had finished third in the heptathlon in
1009, said she lelt confident she could hold her po
sition at the top.
"I always have to compete against Ellannee
[Richardson], my teammate, and Julie linker,"
Evans said Saturday. "I think it'll be difficult to win,
but I think I can do it."
On day two, it looked like Evans might just pull
it off. I inker stumbled in the javelin, throwing 07-
0 to earn just 17.S points and give Evans a little
breathing room. Until the winds shifted again.
Surprise No. 3: Richardson. Evans's Washington
State teammate, decided to make a contest of it. She
ran 2 minutes. 10.58 seconds in the 800 meters, the
final event of the competition, to beat Evans by
three seconds, claim the crown by a mere points
and record her first NCAA automatic qualifying
mark with 5,578 points.
"We, [Richardson and Evans], both knew it was
going to be close, and it was going to come clown to
the 800 meters," Richardson said. "We were going
to have to battle it out."
Evans finished second with 5,540 points, just
missing the automatic qualifier. I inker had a ca
reer-best performance, earning 5.41V2 points. Her
total is a NCAA provisional qualifying mark and
