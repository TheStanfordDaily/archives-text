In its morning he.it, Stanford took an e.isv
set ond behind Southern California, and the

I his was the Stanford varsitv eight's best I 'at -10
finish since 1005 and quite possibly the team's
finest rat e ol the year.

we t e really proud til lit >w we did at I 'at -10s. 11
really ext eedetl our expet lations."
Ihe junior xaristx eight took sixth plate in

to Stanford head coach Ainiee Baker, I C-
I lavis's jiniioi vat silx boat had been fairly even
xvitli Stanford lor the past lew years, including

and we basit allx just wanted to edge out D.ixis.
We got up on t lietn at the slat t and held ihein

didn't want to push 100 much because we want

In the last 500 meters ol the rat e, Stanford
pulled .i 1:55, while I C-I)avisonly managed

Despite lis challengers. Stanford was able to

lake ,111 easy second behind Washington.
I he novice grand final proved to be one of
the most exciting and difficult races of the day
for Stanford. While Washington Stale and

ish since 1995, when it placed fourth in last weekend's conference championships in Sacramenio.
I lu* Stanford xvonien s varsity eight entered
llie I'acifit 10 (onfeicm e Championships
seeded sixth. Bui alter out in
Saturday's race, the Cardinal sailed through
the course at Lake Nalonia in Sat raniento,
notf'liiii^r,i sin-prising fourth-plat e finish.
In its morning he.it, Stanford took an e.isv
set ond behind Southern California, and the
two moved on to the grand final. Stanford look
<in eat Iv lead ovei fourth-seeded ()regon State
and tilth-seeded W ashington Stale. Both < reus
had defeated St an ft >rd earliei in the season, hut
the C iardinal finished the rat e with open watet
separating the boats.
It was great, said senior coxswain (illian
Krell. "It just felt like everything finally
clicked. We llew out <>112 the start and nevei
lot>ked back."
I he final order li.id been established In
hallxvax through the race, with Washington in
first, followed lis I SC. (ialildrnia and Stanford.
I his was the Stanford varsitv eight's best I 'at -10
finish since 1005 and quite possibly the team's
finest rat e ol the year.
in the past years, the top lour teams from
the l'at-10 have gone on It) compete in the
NCAA Championships. IW'tausc ol the addi
tion ola filth region this year, there max be
lexvet Wcstei n teams invited to nationals. Stan
foul s lout ill-place finish therefore makes
tliein long shots lot a national bid.
"('.ei lainly, ii would be great l<»i us to go |to
nationals]," Krell said. "I think that it would
help out program a lot to have Stanford be a
presence at nationals, but even il we don't go
we t e really proud til lit >w we did at I 'at -10s. 11
really ext eedetl our expet lations."
Ihe junior xaristx eight took sixth plate in
the grand final, but the team's real lace <>l the
day ( ante in the morning heal. I he top three
boats moved on, meaning Stanford had to
si axe oil a lough I C-l )avis team to come in he
hind Washington State and I SC. According

to Stanford head coach Ainiee Baker, I C-
I lavis's jiniioi vat silx boat had been fairly even
xvitli Stanford lor the past lew years, including
at a sci inunagc earlier in the season. I he (lar
-11111 a I look an earl) lead, but the LC-Davis
< rexv trailed In less than 10 seconds through
out most ol l he t at e.
I he heat It'll pretty good," said senioi <o
captain Laurie Mason. "We had a good start,
and we basit allx just wanted to edge out D.ixis.
We got up on t lietn at the slat t and held ihein
oil, so ihex were really a non-issue, and then xve
didn't want to push 100 much because we want
ed to < onset xe eneigx lor the final.'*
In the last 500 meters ol the rat e, Stanford
pulled .i 1:55, while I C-I)avisonly managed
a 2:02, gix nig the (Cardinal a 15-second lead at
the finish line and a chance to race in the
grand final.
I he novice eight entered Sunday's rat es
with an iin pi essixe No. seed, but lilted heavy
competition in its morning heal, including
Washington, I C-l lax is and San Diego State.
Despite lis challengers. Stanford was able to

lake ,111 easy second behind Washington.
I he novice grand final proved to be one of
the most exciting and difficult races of the day
for Stanford. While Washington Stale and
Washington quickl) separated themselves
from the pa< k to lake the gold and silver, the
resi ol the learns battled ii out lor bron/e. Stan
ford managed to hold the third-place position
for the first ihree-quarters of ihe race, but was
passed by Oregon Slate at the 1500-meter
mark. ( al then moved up and remained neck
and-ne( k with Stanford lor ihe last 500 meters,
healing ihe (Cardinal by a mere three-lentlis of
a second al ihe finish. I he lifill-plat e finish lor
llie novice ciglu was ihe higlirst in the history
ol Stanford women's rowing.
" I his year was delinitch a big step forward
for Stanford < rew — it puts us in there with the
big guns. Mason said. "We're onlv graduaiing
three people, and next yeai we have seven re
(l nils coming, whi< Ii is one ol ihe biggest re
< i uiting (lasses we've had in a really long lime.
I Ins is |iisi ihe first slip, and I iliink next year
