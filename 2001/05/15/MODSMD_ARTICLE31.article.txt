# Cuban snags MVP with run to border

As ilu* NBA continues
lo announce its post
season awards, I am
still appalled by the
fad that no one even men
tioned m\ name as a voting del
egate fin the selections.
It seems as though the NBA
only wants to entrant hise those
people who are willing to make
their choices based on tradi
tional measures of exc ellenc e,
sue li as statistic s, wins and loss
es, and overall team perfor
mance. Ciiven these guidelines,
111a) be Rookie of the Year Mike
Miller and Defensive I'layer of
the Year Dikembe Mutombo
are deserving recipients.

But what
about the in
tangible cate
gories that are
so easily over
looked by vot
ers? What
about being
able to fake
confidence in

your teammates despite the fact
that you are obviously head
and shoulders above them
(Antawn Jamison)? What about
playing your heart out fora
team you have absolutely no
plans ol playing for next year in
a city ili.it ranks slightly below
Frankfurt, Kentucky on the lisi
of most exciting state capitols
(Chris Webber)? When are the
voters going to look past the
win / loss (<>l uinn and get ai the
real heart of the champion?
I for one am sick and tired of
watching undeserving players
gel handed trophies year alter
year for posting gaudy, mean
ingless slats (Kuri Wat ner, I'm
looking in your direction).
11 ere is my list of the lop pet -
lot mers in eat li spoil based on
my own ratings system.
NFL — No question here,
l he hands down winner is I )ono
van McNahhof the Philadelphia
Fagles. In only his second sea
son in the league, McNabb was
absolutely brilliant despite the
fa< i thai Ins primary running
back was losi lor the season in
the second game and his wide
receiving corps couldn't catch
an SID from a used pack of
I rojans. No player in I he NFL
was more valuable lo bis team
than McNabb. Does anyone re
member how bad the Fagles
were when I hey had Doug Ped
ersen running the show?
And what makes McNabb's
performance this past season
even more remarkable was the
fad that he accomplished .ill of
these great feats in from of a
bunch of Philadelphia hooli
gans — the NFL fan equivalent
of a dru-dealing pimp. Have a
bad outing and they'll curse
you as if \<>n were a prostitute

who stole from their stash.
Kven if you have a good perfor
mance, you're still likely to get
slapped around a bit. Despite it
all. McNabb took the woeful
Kagles of a year ago and turned
them into one o! the premier
teams in the N I ( i.
Major League Baseball —
While the jury is still out on the
current season, there is little
doubt as to who deserves lop
honors from last year's season.
As much as it pains me to say it,
I have to give it to Chuck
Knoblauch of the New York
Yankees. Now I know th.it this
dec ision may come as a shock
to anyone who watched
Knoblauch's repeated imbecili
ty in tht- field during last year's
playoffs, but there is a valid
reason why Knoblauch de
serves this award more than
any other player.
Bottom line: Knoblauch
earned .$(» million last year, and
he didn't even have to play well
to do il. Knoblauch might just
be the worst defensive second
baseman I have ever seen (the
Yanks have moved him lo leit
field this year to try lo keep him
•is far away from the ball as pos
sible), but, despite this lack of
talent, lie has amassed four
World Series titles with the
Yankees and 1 wins and a small
fortune as well.
Knoblauch is, in essence,
the very ideal of the American
Dream playing for America's
team in America's pastime.
I lis ineptitude tan be looked
lo as a model for all young as
pirants, proving that you
don't really have 10 be good —
in fact you don't even have to
be respectable — to earn mil
lions of dollars and win the
World Series. Now, sure, 1
could have given this award to
a "good" player or even a "de
cent" player, but sometimes
it's the crappy guys who in
spire me the most.
NIII, — Those of you who
read my last column know that
I do not really consider hock
ey to be a professional sport.
I hat said, my default winner
in this category is Anna
Kournikova. She is the only
good thing about the sport of
hockey, and I hope ili.it both
Pavel Bure and Sergei
l ederov soon lose their youth
ful good looks so that maybe
Anna will become a groupie
for Stanford sports columnists
rather than hockey players.
NAS( IAR — You've got to be
joking. Ihe only person that
could possibly be considered
lot top honors in this category
is ilie mullet-wearing, beer
gu//ling fan from North Car-


Ryan Stewart
