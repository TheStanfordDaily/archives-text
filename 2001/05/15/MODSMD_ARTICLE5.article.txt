A proposal by several faculty members in the
School of I lumaniticsand Si icnc es tooflei .1 mastei s

approved iinanimonsh b\ the I.units Senate at its
last meeting.
I be approval came alter the program's dire< tor,
Linguistic s Prof. Ivan S.ij;. and his team presented to
and obtained approval from several groups and
committees. I lie team met with the departments that
comprise the program, as well as with committees
from the Sc 11001 <»l I lumanitics and Sc icnc es and the
Faculty Senate.
In addition to what students stud\ as undcrgiadu

usual depth and breadth in aieasof (ognitive s< ic nc e.
It will also require students toeomplete a 1 igorous re
search project supervised by a person affiliated with
the program, ac cording to Sag.
Although 110 official admissions procedures and
requirements have been established vet, those details
are expected to be solidified within the- next lour to
eight weeks, .it which point the program (oordinators

will start accepting students' applit .itions.

Many ot the undergraduate
symbolic systems graduates work
in high-tech fields after gradua

the lagging job market lor these
companies will affect the popu

"The current state of affairs in
Silicon Valley is filtering out the

best people, and. as we are here to
provide the best graduates, the
recession should not affect the
number of students signing up to
the new SSI' masters [program|,"
he said.
Program Coordinator Todd
Davies confirmed that there has
been no drop-off in undergradu
ate declarations for the program
because of the state of the stock or
job markets.
