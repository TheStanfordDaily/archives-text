# New center dedicated to biologist
## Hopkins to house new microscopes at research center 
### SUSAN TIEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Hopkins Marine Station
dedicated a new research ( enter in
honor of the late biologist Daniel
Ma/ia last Thursday. The Ma/ia
Microscopy ( '.enter is located in the
Jacques I.oeb laboratory at I lop
kins, a marine biology researc li and
educational institution that li 111 c -
tions as a brand) of the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences.
The Ma/ia Microscopy (ienter
houses two powerful new micro
scopes: a multi-photon microscope

said I )avid F.pel, .i profess( >r of tna

Stuart I hompson, a professor
of biological sciences at Hopkins,
was named the direc tor of the new
center. Noting that Monterey lla\
is a "huge biological resource,"
Thompson said, "We are very ex
citecl to have instruments with this
kind ol resolution at a field station."
I hompson said that manv animals
that live in the area "have never
been observed before" with such

Faculty, graduate students and
undergraduates performing rc

open to otbei lo< al si icntists.
Thompson said.
Daniel Vfa/ia was a pioneering
cell biologist. I lis field of km ,iii Ii
was cell division, and he remains
most famous for his stud\ ol mito
sis. In 1051, with Japanese biologist
Katsuma Dan, \la/ia isolated tlu
mitotic apparatus, the structure
that is responsible for cell division.
Ma/.ia also performed early ex
periments on the role ol DNA in
chromosomes. latet, his woik fo
cused on the centrosome, an or
ganelle that organi/es the cell's
structure.
Ma/ia was born Dec . 18, 1912.
I le latet attended the I Diversity of
Pennsylvania, earning both his
bachelor's degree and his doctor
ate there.
From 1937 to 1938, he was a
National Research Council Fel
low at Princeton I nivcrsity and at
the Marine Biological Laborato
ries in Woods Hole, M.iss. Ma/ia
taught zoology .it the I niversity
ot Missouri and later at I C
lierkeley, .i position from which
he retired in 1979.
Because he wished to continue
his research, Mazia was named a

professor emeritus in biological sci
ences at the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion from 1979 until his death in
1990 at the age of 83.
"He was a passionate scientist
who lived bis work and trans
ferred bis passion to bis students,"
s.iid Fpel, vv ho was Ma/.ia's student
.it I ( .-Berkeley and his colleague
at 1 lopkins.
Ma/.ia's achievements will also
be honored with an annual Daniel
M.i/ia Memorial Lecture, funded
by .i grant from the Pack Founda
tion .ind by contributions from
Ma/.ia's students, colleagues and
friends. I he first lecture was given
by rim 11 tint of the Imperial
