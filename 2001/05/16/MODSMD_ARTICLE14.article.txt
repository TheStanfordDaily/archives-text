On May 16, 19S0, 1 lie Daily printed an article
about distribution requirements.
"This fall's freshmen will select from over 300
courses in fulfilling distribution requirements under
a plan approved yesterday by the Faculty Senate.
" The revised course list is one-seventh the size of
this \ear's list which includes more than 2,ooocours
es, according to 1 listory Prof. (larolyn Lou gee, head
of the (Committee on I ndergraduate Studies.
"Among the most popular courses which will no
longer fulfill distribution requirements are Crimi
nal Justice, Human Sexuality and the Psychology
of Madness.
"'Courses will be sequenced between areas to
offer students 'meals' rather than 'snacks,' she
added."
Bottom line: Wonder if our general education requirement
courses offer "meals" or "snacks"?
