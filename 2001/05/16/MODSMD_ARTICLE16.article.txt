### 
PROVO, Utah (AP) — Utah's first
polygamy t rial in nearly 50 years opened
yesterday with a prosecutor outlining
the tangled marital history of a man with
five wives and at least 29 children.
Tom Green, 52, faces (barges ol
bigamy and failing to pay child support.
I le could get up to 25 years in prison and
$25,000 in lines.
Green has said that he follows Mor
mon beliefs as they existed more than a
century ago, before the church re
nounced polygamy, and that his consti
tutional right to freedom ol religion al

lows him to take main wives.
He has vigorously defended his
lifestvle on I V talk shows.
Prosecutor David Leavitt walked |inois
through a maze ol names and mat i iage
dates and painted a siai k picture ol the
(Jreen lamil\ home in the I tab deset t. de
scribing it as ,i cluster ol rainshat kle nail
ers amid dirt roads and sagebt ush.
Leavitt, the younger brothel ol Gov.
Mike Leavitt, told the jut \ of live women
and three men that there is nothing
noble in Green's motives.
Borrowing a line Itoin Groucho Vlarx

that drew grins from the audience, 1 .eavitt
said: "(>ne of the things the evident e will
del lion strati- is ili.it loin Green leels like
il's prett\ big ol him lo have so many wives
aiki so main ( hildren. It will also demon
si i ale that il's higatm."
Green is also charged separately wilh
child rape stemming fr<>m his mairiage lo
one ol Ins wives when she was l!V 1 hat
trial lias not \ci been scheduled, and the
inattct cannol be mentioned during the
bigann trial.
So 1 .eavitt (arelulh avoided mentioning
the.igesol the voung women Green mar

ried — most ol them around 14 and 15.
Prosecutors also showed the jin\ clips
from more than a hall-do/en TV appear
ances the family made, including "hale
line," " IS Hours," "Judge Judy, ' "The
|err\ Springer Show" and shows from
Krciu li .ind |apanese television.
Leavitt has said that without the media
attention, he would never have even
known about (Jreen.
In the videos, the family talked about
llieir children, their daily rituals — in
cluding laundry for two dozen
children — and llieir sex lives, which

drew clucks of disapproval and suit kers
from die courtroom audience.
(ircen's attorney, John Hucher, said
the tapes were edited to locus on "the
most prurient" sections.
"1 le may be what you think <>l as . . . a
bad man, but th.it is irrelevant to the
case," he said.
Although polygamy was banned when
Utah became a state in 18VH>, there h.is
not been a major prosecution since led
eral agents raided the polygamous town
of.Short ('.reek on the I Itah-Ai i/ona line,
in l ( .). r ).S.
