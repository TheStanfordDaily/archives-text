WASHINGTON (AP) — I he bountiful U.S. aid
pat kage lor Kgypt, unchallenged lor two decades,
was tjuestionetl vesterday by a powerful Republican
scnatoi who complained thai Kgypt's governmcnt
suppoi led press had "been spewing anti-Semitism at
an all-time high."
N asser Aralat, the Palestinian leader, also came
undci < 1 nit isin by Sen. Mit< h Mc(lonnell, R-Ky., lor
walking awa\ "from ilu- best deal ihe Palestinians will
likely ever see.
"What more can Israel oiler?" McConnell asked
SeeretaiA <>l Slate C.olin Powell at a Senate Appropri
aiions subcommittee hearing into the Bush adminis
tration's budget request lor $15.2 billion lor foreign
operations — a boost ol about 2 percent over this
year. M< Council chairs the subcommittee.
Powell urged Congress not to cut the $2 billion
tickctcd lor Kgvpt, second in annual I S. ait I only It)
Isi acl's almost $!i billion. He saitl Kgypl and Jordan,
Israel's oilier Arab neighbor with a peace treaty, are
making a major t ontribution toend lighting between
Israel and the Palestinians with a joint cease-fire pro
posal.
I hex "play an important part in the region," Pow
ell said.
McConnell cautioned, however: "I do not view
foreign assistance as an entitlement and will be re
view ing more (loselv country-specific aid packages.
For example, he questioned the justification for of
fering $75 million in aid to Palestinians on the West
Hank and in Gaza when no end it) their violent con
frontation with Israel is in sight.
Relet t ing to both Kgvpt and the Palestinians, Mc
(lonnell told Powell: "It's hard to see how any of them
in a visible way have tried to move the process in the
right direction.'
In Kgypt, he said, "government-sponsored news
papers support Adolf Hitler and incite violence
against Jews and Israel. Is ibis kind of relationship
worth the request ol $2 billion.""
Similarly, Sen. Mary Landrieu, 1)-La., urged the
Bush administration to reassess the I .S. relationship
with the Palestinians. She referred to a letter to Pres
ident Bush from (i() senators in April accusing the
"highest level" ol Palestinian security forces ol plan
ning terrorist attacks on Israel.
Powell agreed with McConnell that Israel last year
made a generous oiler to the Palestinians. It included
statehood on virtually all the West Bank and Gaza
and control over part of Jerusalem. Arafat held out

lor sovereignty over Kasi Jerusalem and a "right ol re
iurn" lor millions of Palestinians to Israel.
Powell said he himself had been a targeted by the
Kgvptian press and had complained and ret eived an
apology Irom the government.
Under quizzing by Sen. Arlen Specter. R-I'a., Pern
ell insisted that Israel should not overreact t<> Pales
tinian attacks.
"I understand the inherent righi ol self-defense.
I've lived under those terms of engagement lot
many, many years. So there is an inherent right <>l
sell-defense," Powell said. "But in exercising that in
herent right ol sell-defense, if you don I want to niakt
the situation even worse, I think that the response has
to be very carefully calibrated and propoi donate."
Specter nevertheless defended Israel's retaliatory
strikes. He said Arafat had denied to him "eyeball to
eyeball'' in the Palestinian leader's oflice that the
Palestinians had fired mortars at Israel. Yet I S. in
telligence confirmed to liini that Arafat was behind
the mortar attack, Spec ter s.iid.
"While Israel did respond very, very lon chills. Is
rael could have responded even nnu li more lore chil
ly," Spec ter said.
Later Tuesday the Hush administration stepped
up its lace-to-lace contact with the Palestine Libera
tion Organization as Powell met loi more than an
hour with Arafat's top deputy.
Gondoleezz.a Rice, President George \Y. Bush's
national security adviser, attended part ol the meet
ing with Mahmoud Abbas, which was held in the State
Department. Powell and Abbas canceled plans to
speak to reporters afterward.
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said: "It was an extensive disc ussion of all the issues in
the region."
Abbas, also known .is Abu Mazcn, planned to ask
the Bush administration to find a mechanism that
would end Israel's control ol Palestinian lands, said
11 assail Abdel Rahman, the head ol the Palestine Lib
eration ()rganiz.alion's ollice in Washington.
I Ins could involve proposals b\ a commission
headed by former .Senate Majority Leader George
Mite hell, which recommended an end to Jewish set
tlement activity and imposition of the joint cease-lire
proposal by Kgvpt and Jordan, Rahman said.
I he While House has not ruled out an invitation
to Arafat. In New York, senior Palestinian ncgotiatoi
Sacb Krekat said Aralat "wants nothing more than t<
reach an agreement.
