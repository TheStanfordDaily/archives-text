THE UNIVERSITY, WIT 11 its ill

concerns that were brought up during the
heated debate — we are (listui bed by the an

in the potential merger. According to

as long as the late of the department niergei

Students, tlie backbone of this University,
are being shortchanged by the University's
<lc( ision. Who would blame prolessors in the
departments in (juestion lot wanting to leave
Stanford given how they and their depart
ments have been treated? But losing those
prolessors aliens students and their educa
tion directly, which makes it difficult to un
derstand the lack of student input on the new
merger committee.
Stanlord boasts a world-renowned faculty
and stall, with Nobel Prize winners, Pulitzer
Prize winners and internationally recognized

teachers in their respective fields, yet Stanford
faces its greatest challenge since its founding.
No, it's not the $1 billion fimdraising cam
paign, nor the campaign for land use in the
Foothills. The problem is satisfying staff and
students. One sure way the University could
start to remedy the situation is to work quickly
to correct and complete the department issue.
When this is done, whatever the decision,
the departments can begin hiring professors
with full confidence in their place within the
University and their job security. The Univer
sity should not punish the departments for
wanting to slow down the unpopular merger.
Rather, it should remain committed, as would
be expected, to doing what is best for the Uni
versity community.
