# LET FRIEDOM RING
## Stop editing yourselves 
### 
Last week, .1 column appeared
in ilns newspaper — with nix
name on it — that I did not
write in its eniiret\. When I
leit I lie I >ail\ I ucsdax evening, m\
< <>111 niti leatnred an opening line that I
had authored. When I woke tip
Wednesdax morning and glanced .it
the paper, it spotted a brand new 111-
trodtu tion.
Initially, I was shocked. My editors
had (in parts ol prex ions columns, hut
adding to ihein was alwa\s a coopera-

live decision. W'liai right
did they have lo add a
line lo ni\ woi k without
< onsulting me? I)id the
opening line conn ibute
something I had ne
gle< led lo include? Re-
rd U •ss, who was to
Name l<>i ihis c^iegi«mis
error?
Kventually, when

not a single leaflet asked ine ahonl the
line in question, my aggravation siih
sided. I reali/ed that the ( hange made
little dillerence. I reali/ed that inv edi
lois were onl\ doing their jobs. I real
i/ed ih.ti m\ ciealive voice had not
been compromised by their editorial
de< ision.
Hut I was lelt with a newfound
awareness. Kditing is not a process rel
egated to the newspaper room. Not is
it defined In ,i conplc of obscure cate
gories at the Oscars. Ihe act of
editing —to restrict, add, suppress,
control or cut —dominates many
fat els of our lives.
I liink aboni it. Not onl\ are other
people editing us. we edit ourselves all
the time. I he diflerence? We can't help
it il others feel the need to edit us. But
must we be so harsh on ourselves?
From the 10-page papers we ( rank
out quarterly to the voluminous theses
'li.it 1111 advisers desks this week, we, as
students, are taught lo edit our work
with fastidious precision.
"Revise, revise, and when you I liink
il looks good, revise again," reminded
my Writing and Critical flunking in
structor from day one. I jusi know thai,
somewhere, Prof. (i. Ramtnar is think
ing, "What's so bad about thai?"
I he answer is overkill. After many
years of this self-censoring behavior,
we've been conditioned to edit our
thoughts in their formative stages. We
are constantly trying to perfect the
words from the moment they're assem
bled in our heads.

11 you're like me, yon c.m t even fin
ish typing one sentence helore xou
begin to i nt, paste, reorganize and
spell (heck (In the wav, does this last
sentence look oka\ ?). Ihe dangei is
getting Happed in the details helore
letting the mind wandei into the realm
ol li ne (1 eati\ n\.
Consider the lollowing analogx.
Would son lone a newborn hah\ to

emerged Ironi the womb? I'nless
yon ve just birlhed I onva Harding,
probablv not. Mosi babies 11*(111irc*
plenty ol nurturing and exploration
before thc\ decide to hit the ice (oi
then opponents knee caps) in pin Mill

I his cdil-( i azx incut.ilitx perxades

assistant in a licshman dorm, I have
witnessed firsthand the ellect |iisi one

those paths Ironi thotighl to speech
boast as many roadblocks as the I S.-

I'm not arguing that unedited ver
bal explosions are hcalthv — in lad,
just one out but si max lead xom h iends
to diagnose you xxith I'ou relic Sxn
dronie. Bui, letting vour voice or xoui
pen out once in a while, lice to roam
the deep recesses ol your mind, max
actually be quite soothing.
I lave you seen " Finding Fori ester?"
I ry this. (Hose your door, sit down at
your computer and just stall typing.
Okay, now don't slop! Keep typing
until the words no longer lorni in vour
head, and vou led a sense ol empty
content take over. Youi composition
will be fresh, honest and convex a true
sense of self.
When you're .ill done, e-mail it to
I he 1 )aily lor consideration. I hex may
just publish ii. but not without one or
two minor changes.
