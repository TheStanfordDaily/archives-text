Obituary leaves out

Today's kind obituary only began to
scratch ai the surface of the tremendous con
tribution of Joseph Greenberg to African
scholarship and to the Stanford academic
community. Not only did his reworking of

tin* entire history of language evolution in
continental Africa lxroine the seminal work
on African linguistics, ii significantly re
shaped our knowledge of African pre-colo
nial history and proved the historical value of
linguistic reconstruction.
Moreover, and this was omitted from
the notice, Cireenberg founded the Center
for African Studies at Stanford University
and was a pioneer of interdisciplinary area
studies here. As the first director of the now
nationally renowned (enter — one of a
handful 111 the U.S. with Federal Title VI
funding — Greenberg launched Stan
ford s Africanist scholarship into an entire
ly new realm. I hope the superb current di
rector, History Prof. Richard Roberts,
shares my belief that a fitting tribute to this
pioneer of African studies would be to re
name the center in his honor.
