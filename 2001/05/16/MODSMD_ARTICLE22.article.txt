# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Meat-eater speaks out against vegetarians, reverence for body 
### MARK GANEK GUEST COLUMNIST 
I habitually a»s<uiate almost exclu
sively with geeks, buniouts ami
weirdos. Naurally, 1 know a lot of
vegetarians. In the past, when 1
would dine out wih this particular species
ol geek, I would bjcome vegetarian bv as
sociation. 1 would:onduct invsell asa veg
etarian: Ordering bland dishes, munch
ing on roughageand belittling the wait
stall for misidentiying the soup stock.
No more. I atna proud omnivore with
the type of teeth tiat designed to rip and
tear flesh. So now I trv to make vegetari
ans feel as uncoiifortable as they trv to
make us meat-eatjrs feel with their holi
er-than-thou spec lies about tortured an
imals and ai res ofcvasted grain.
I order things hat aren't even on the
menu, like Ireshlyc lubbed baby li.up seal
ribs. At this poiit, the vegetarian gri
maces and the server laughs — unless

the server is a vegetarian, in which case
he pretends to laugh and then does
something unspeakable to my steak.
1 believe that vegetarians should be
eradicated, only because their prejudice
against meat makes the legalization of
cannibalism in America less viable. I find
it hard to believe that advocates of this
lifestyle are marginalized while truly dan
gerous elements — like people who are
still quoting Austin Powers — are al
lowed — nay, encouraged — to flourish.
No one has vet explained to me why we
bin \ perfectly good meat in designated
areas that could dearly be better utilized
as open-air grill space. To let all that meat
go uneaten while people starve is uncon
scionable. Anything else is pure sentimen
talism. We could feed the hungry, and, as
.m added bonus for vou vegetarians out
there, we would lull fewer cows.
It's time we woke up to the fact that
our death rituals are hilarious and worse
than useless. I've heard all the talk about

starting the mourning process, but, real
ly, its all about the living gaining an un
earned forgiveness for our mistakes.
Dicln t tell the lonely person that you
loved him because it made you uncom
fortable? Tell him now, while lie's right
there in the box. Treated someone terri
bly for years? Apologi/e now, while
they're quiet and won't talk back.
I went to a lot of funerals as .1 child,
mostly for people 1 didn't reallv know,
and 1 always came awav feeling that I
had witnessed the burial of a saint. I his
was before 1 realized that the only occu
pational requirement of a eulogist is ,111
ability to lie, convincingly and repeated
ly. Its too late to treat the dead the way
the way you feel you should have, so
stop making those shadowy gestures
around the casket.
And then there are the accouter
ments: the suit, the flowers, the make-up
caked on like Tammy lave and the cof
fin. (' 'You went with mahogany, didn't

your I he oak seems so ... 1 don't know,
pedestrian?") ()f course, this is after the
embalmer pumps out the blood and re
places it with a c lear fluid, with the goal
of preserving the appearance of the
meat. ("1 le looks so natural.") So there it
is again, that ugly word: meat. Whether
you believe in an eternal soul or a god
less chaotic darkness, there lies the
body. Meat. Meat that we treat with
more deference, kindness and delicacv
than we ever treated the person. So why
not eat it instead? It's not as it he needs
it anymore.
Now I'm sure you're all thinking,
"Sure, you're happy to let the 'other guv'
simmer in a /esiv gumbo. What about
you.-' 111111. punk?" Fair question. In
order to dispel all doubts about my sin
cerity, I have posted the followingoll the
Internet, and I assure you that 1 will con
sider all reasonable offers. The legality is
gray, but I'm reasonably sure that, if all
useful organs are removed beforehand,

the law that forbids selling organs < an be
sidestepped.

I habitually a»s<uiate almost exclu
sively with geeks, buniouts ami
weirdos. Naurally, 1 know a lot of
vegetarians. In the past, when 1
would dine out wih this particular species
ol geek, I would bjcome vegetarian bv as
sociation. 1 would:onduct invsell asa veg
etarian: Ordering bland dishes, munch
ing on roughageand belittling the wait
stall for misidentiying the soup stock.
No more. I atna proud omnivore with
the type of teeth tiat designed to rip and
tear flesh. So now I trv to make vegetari
ans feel as uncoiifortable as they trv to
make us meat-eatjrs feel with their holi
er-than-thou spec lies about tortured an
imals and ai res ofcvasted grain.
I order things hat aren't even on the
menu, like Ireshlyc lubbed baby li.up seal
ribs. At this poiit, the vegetarian gri
maces and the server laughs — unless

the server is a vegetarian, in which case
he pretends to laugh and then does
something unspeakable to my steak.
1 believe that vegetarians should be
eradicated, only because their prejudice
against meat makes the legalization of
cannibalism in America less viable. I find
it hard to believe that advocates of this
lifestyle are marginalized while truly dan
gerous elements — like people who are
still quoting Austin Powers — are al
lowed — nay, encouraged — to flourish.
No one has vet explained to me why we
bin \ perfectly good meat in designated
areas that could dearly be better utilized
as open-air grill space. To let all that meat
go uneaten while people starve is uncon
scionable. Anything else is pure sentimen
talism. We could feed the hungry, and, as
.m added bonus for vou vegetarians out
there, we would lull fewer cows.
It's time we woke up to the fact that
our death rituals are hilarious and worse
than useless. I've heard all the talk about

starting the mourning process, but, real
ly, its all about the living gaining an un
earned forgiveness for our mistakes.
Dicln t tell the lonely person that you
loved him because it made you uncom
fortable? Tell him now, while lie's right
there in the box. Treated someone terri
bly for years? Apologi/e now, while
they're quiet and won't talk back.
I went to a lot of funerals as .1 child,
mostly for people 1 didn't reallv know,
and 1 always came awav feeling that I
had witnessed the burial of a saint. I his
was before 1 realized that the only occu
pational requirement of a eulogist is ,111
ability to lie, convincingly and repeated
ly. Its too late to treat the dead the way
the way you feel you should have, so
stop making those shadowy gestures
around the casket.
And then there are the accouter
ments: the suit, the flowers, the make-up
caked on like Tammy lave and the cof
fin. (' 'You went with mahogany, didn't

your I he oak seems so ... 1 don't know,
pedestrian?") ()f course, this is after the
embalmer pumps out the blood and re
places it with a c lear fluid, with the goal
of preserving the appearance of the
meat. ("1 le looks so natural.") So there it
is again, that ugly word: meat. Whether
you believe in an eternal soul or a god
less chaotic darkness, there lies the
body. Meat. Meat that we treat with
more deference, kindness and delicacv
than we ever treated the person. So why
not eat it instead? It's not as it he needs
it anymore.
Now I'm sure you're all thinking,
"Sure, you're happy to let the 'other guv'
simmer in a /esiv gumbo. What about
you.-' 111111. punk?" Fair question. In
order to dispel all doubts about my sin
cerity, I have posted the followingoll the
Internet, and I assure you that 1 will con
sider all reasonable offers. The legality is
gray, but I'm reasonably sure that, if all
useful organs are removed beforehand,

the law that forbids selling organs < an be
sidestepped.

It's entirely up to you.
