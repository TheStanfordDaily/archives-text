young girls in blue-and-white school uniforms gath
ered for noisy middav rallies throughout the West

A three-minute siren at noon, at companictl bv the
sounds of Muslim prayei calls and church bells,
brought a brief moment of < aim. In Kamallah, thou

cutioners continue to walk through the puddles of
our blood with their military escalation and siege of
our towns."
Protesters chantcd, waved Palestinian flags and
marchcd to Israeli military posts on the outskirts of
Palestinian cities. Rock-throwing and tire-burning
quickly est alated into an ext hange of gunfire in sev
eral < ilies.
At a traflit circle neai kamallah, a regular flash
point dining the Israeli-Palestinian fighting, stone
throwers took covci behind the burned out skeletons
of wrecked tars as a steatb stream of ambulances
pit ketl up voung men wounded by Israeli fire.

buildings shot at Israeli soldiers and Israeli tanks
i tunbled into Palestinians out rolled ten it on firing at
