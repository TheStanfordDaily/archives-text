### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Going m,<) the season, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team merely hoped to qualify for the 1(>-
teain field .it the I'.S. Lacrosse Intercollegiate Asso
ciates club lacrosse national championships in St.
Louis, Mo. Instead, stilling defense, a methodical of
fense .iiul out standing team chemistry propelled the
( ardinal all the way to the championship game.
Stanford shocked favored opponents Simon
l raser, Sonoma Slate and L'C-Santa Barbara on its
way to a l(i-7 loss at the hands of perennial power
(Colorado State in the championship.
Our expectations this season were high, but
never m our wildest dreams could we have hoped
for .1 second-place finish," said senior co-captain
Marc Levin.
I he team entered St. Louis seeded 12th after an
1 1-5 campaign that ended disappointingly, with
consecutive losses to arch-rival California in the final
game of the regular season and the first round of the
West Coast Lac rosse League Tournament.
With the pressure oil, the Cardinal approached
the national championships as a chance to forget
their late-season malaise and show what they could
do.
"We went in with the thought that we had noth
ing to lose, said assistant coach Mark Lipscomb.
"We were happy to make the tournament and want
ed to enjoy it . . . That attitude led us to play very re
laxed .uul play better than we ever have."
I he Cardinal upset fifth-seeded Simon Fraser2o
- I in the first round of the championships on the
strength of a seven-goal performance by senior
llrvan I)unagan.
In the second round, Stanford took on nemesis
Sonoma State, the WCLL champions. Sophomore
goalie Joe Kennedy and a determined defense held
the fourth-seeded Cossacks scoreless in the first half
on the way to a hard-lought 7-4 victory.
"Our defense played outstanding today," head
coach Pete Bijesse told USLIA after the game. "We
kept our ( hecks on their hands all game long." The
win was Stanford's first over the Cossacks in 10
vears.
