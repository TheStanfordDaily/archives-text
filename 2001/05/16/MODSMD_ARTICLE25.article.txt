# Hot or not: Can statistics tell all?

### 
Pop quiz, sports fan:
You're an NBA roach
down by one, and you're
drawing up the last play of
the game. You've got two choices
to take the last shot: Mark or Bob.
Mark's a 55 percent shooter, but
he's missed his last four shots 111 a
row. Bob's a 50 percent shooter,
but he's hot: I "lie Iflsi three times
he's touched the ball, he's drained
the shot. Who do you want taking
that game-winner?
Got your answer? Okay.

and good for slats class, but, when
you're in I lie game, you've got to
factor in emotion, fatigue and
heart — how players actually play,
not |usi how you crunch some
numbers. Everyone knows that.
Trouble is. everyone's wrong.

psychologists.
I've been struggling with this
article since it was brought up in a

( lass of mine a few weeks back. It's
t ailed "The Hot Hand in Basket
ball: ()u the Misperception of Ran
dom Sequences," by I homas
(lilovich, Robert Vallone and
Amos I versky, published in 1985
in the journal, "(Cognitive Psychol
ogy." I he summary is simple: The
concept of "being hot" is a myth.
Basketball players are no more
likely. and often less likely, to make
•i shot after a streak of baskets than
they are in other circumstances.
"The/.one" is a misperception cre
ated b\ fallacies in how people rea
son about probability.
I hose are strong statements,
and (iilovic li and the others knew
it. But the evidence they've pro
duced is powerful and persua
sive. They started by examining
shooting data from the 1985
Philadelphia 7(>crs, a team com
manded by a doctor of its own —
| ulins Krving. Ihe basic data is
simple: A given player's shooting
percentage after one, two or
three missed shots in a row was
statistically identical to his shoot
ing percentage alter one, two or
three made shots in a row, and
they were both essentially the
same as ihe player's season shoot
ing percentage.
In other words, players shot the
same no matter how many shots
they'd made or missed in a row.
I lie correlation between how
many shots a player had made in a
row — how "hot" or "cold" he was
— and Ins likelihood of making
the next one was zero or even
slightly negative. This makes sense
because players making three

shots in a row are more likely to get
double-teamed, take harder shots
and so on.
The research team then ran a
couple more statistical icsts, most
notably analyzing every players'
shots as sets of four shots and see
ing how main were "hot" (three or
four made), "moderate" (two
made) or "cold" (none or one
made). There were plenty ol hot
and cold streaks — exa< tlyasmany
as there would be for, say, Hipping
a coin that had the players' shoot
ing percentage built in. No emo
tional effects, no "zone," no "the
hoop looks a mile wide,'' nothing.
(iilovich, Yallone and l'versk\
ran the same tests and several
more on Boston (ieltk s free-throw
data and Cornell basketball play
ers shooting In themselves in a
g\ m. Even test thev ran came out
the same: Players don't get "hot"
oi "cold." I he) have streaks, sure,
hut precisely as main and as long
as vou'd expet t from a probabilis
tic process unaffected b\ thought
or emotion.
I his last p<tint is .i key one, and

the research team suggests ili.it
misunderstandings of it are \vli\
the "hot hand" belief exists.
Giilovich et. al. aren't suggesting
that runs don't happen — they're
suggesting that people in general
don't believe random sequences
generate .is many runs as they ac
tually do. Relatively short ran
dom sequent es. sut li as coin flips,
often look pretty streaky; it often
takes tens or hundreds of coin
flips for the true 50 / 50 probabil
ities to emerge. ()n the flip sitle,
people fated with a sequence of
heads and tails that alternate al
most perfectly (such as heads
being followed bv tails 90 pert cut
of the time and vice versa) often
label the sequence as "random."
even though such ordered alter
nation is iiit redihlv unlikely.
It's a powerful attai k on one of
the most tried-and-true concepts
in sports. I he /one, thev argue, is
a lie, or at least an error. What
should you make of all this, as a
fan? Should we quit playing the
games and just have Monty mail
our team stats to the league office
when thev need 1 esults? Wouldn't
we .ill be better off just flipping
coins .it home, rather than
shelling out for tickcts, painting
our fat es, shaving our heads and

driving our blood pressure
through the root by sweating for
this sad, random sport?
Maybe so. hut (lilovich's team
doesn't want that. " The indepen
dence between successive shots."
they write, "does not mean that
basketball is a game of chance
rather than skill, nor should it
render the game less exciting to
plav, watch or analyze . . . [ 1 he
game) is analogous to coin tossing
where the outcomes of successive
tosses are independent but the
probability ol heads depends on
measurable f.u tors su< h as the ini
tial position of the coin ... Neither
coin tossing nor basketball are in
herentlv random, once .ill the rel
evant parameters are specified.
Wist* words. Makes sense to me.
Somehow, though, I suspect
the next time ( asev comes streak
ing down the floor after draining
a couple long treys in a row, I
won't be shouting f'oi him to pass
it. Mavbe 1 should be. But would
that make me happy? Heck, no.
I've seen reality, and I II take the
beautiful lie even time.
