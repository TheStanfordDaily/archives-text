Pop quiz, sports fan:
You're an NBA roach
down by one, and you're
drawing up the last play of
the game. You've got two choices
to take the last shot: Mark or Bob.
Mark's a 55 percent shooter, but
he's missed his last four shots 111 a
row. Bob's a 50 percent shooter,
but he's hot: I "lie Iflsi three times
he's touched the ball, he's drained
the shot. Who do you want taking
that game-winner?

and good for slats class, but, when
you're in I lie game, you've got to
factor in emotion, fatigue and

Trouble is. everyone's wrong.

I've been struggling with this
article since it was brought up in a

( lass of mine a few weeks back. It's
t ailed "The Hot Hand in Basket
ball: ()u the Misperception of Ran
dom Sequences," by I homas
(lilovich, Robert Vallone and
Amos I versky, published in 1985
in the journal, "(Cognitive Psychol
ogy." I he summary is simple: The
concept of "being hot" is a myth.
Basketball players are no more
likely. and often less likely, to make
•i shot after a streak of baskets than
they are in other circumstances.
"The/.one" is a misperception cre
ated b\ fallacies in how people rea
son about probability.
I hose are strong statements,
and (iilovic li and the others knew
it. But the evidence they've pro
duced is powerful and persua
sive. They started by examining
shooting data from the 1985
Philadelphia 7(>crs, a team com
manded by a doctor of its own —
| ulins Krving. Ihe basic data is
simple: A given player's shooting
percentage after one, two or
three missed shots in a row was
statistically identical to his shoot
ing percentage alter one, two or
three made shots in a row, and
they were both essentially the
same as ihe player's season shoot
ing percentage.
In other words, players shot the
same no matter how many shots
they'd made or missed in a row.
I lie correlation between how
many shots a player had made in a
row — how "hot" or "cold" he was
— and Ins likelihood of making
the next one was zero or even
slightly negative. This makes sense
because players making three
