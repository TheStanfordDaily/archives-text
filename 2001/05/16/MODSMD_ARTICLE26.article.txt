# Experienced Uhlfelder leads Card lacrosse to the top
## 
### ANNIE WELCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Iburth-consecutive Women's Western
lacrosse League title, a perfect WWLL
record, wins against top-ranked teams and
a first-ever national ranking all contributed
to making this season the best in Stanford
women's lacrosse history.
I lie mastermind behind this impressive
display was Stanford's new head coach,
Michele Uhlfelder. In her first season at

Stanford, Uhlfelder was able to combine
her experience and passion for the game to
make great strides in the ('.ardinal women's
lacrosse program.
"We were very excited to be able to get
Michele," said Asst. Athletics Director Karl
Koberlein. "We knew that it would be a
statement to the lacrosse community, and
she really exceeded our expectations."
Uhlfelder brings a wealth of coaching
experience to the Farm. She came to Stan
ford this year from Duke, where she was the

associate head coach List season. I 'hllelder
previously held positions .is the assistant
coach at Duke for one season and at Old
Dominion for lour seasons.
The experienced coach is no stranger to
the national spotlight. In her seven yeai s <>l
Division I coaching, she has been the dri
ving force behind a 1999 l iiial Font squad,
a (Conference (championship team in 199")
and six All-American selections.
Uhlfelder''s experience as a player is also
marked bv success. As a member t >1 the I SA

National team since 1991. Uhlfelder has
continued to be a competitive forte in the
laciosse community. Since 1991, she has
been a member of the U.S. Elite team and
has competed internationally on the C ireat
Britain and Australian louring teams.
Currently, I hllelder is one of 24 players
competing lor one of the 16 spots on the
2001 World ('.up team, which will compete
in England in July.
In her collegiate career, I hllelder was a
four-year starter and captain of the

women's lacrosse team during lier senioi
year ai Maryland. Maryland lacrosse has .1
reputation of excellence in the national
arena, and Uhllelder helped lead the Ter
rapins to national runner-up finishes in
both 1990 .ukl 1991. In hei senior year,
Uhllelder was distinguished as a First I earn
All-Amcrican and the National Oflensive
Player of the Year.
Traditionally, West (loast lacrosse has
been .1 step behind the Kast in the
lacrosse community. However,
L'hlfelder s presence is turning
heads. I ler background, combined
with her vision foi West Coast
lac rosse, helped the Stanford team
become the first West (oast team to
break into the Intel collegiate
Women's Lit rosse (1 >ac hesAssc >t i
ation top-20 ranking.
"West ( o.lst Lac rosse is like sit
ting on .1 gold mine. I hlielder
said. "It is a time bomb waiting to
go off ."
I hlielder may be the one re
sponsible for igniting this time
bomb, as the siimc-ss of her pro
gram will hopelulK t.iuse other
West ( o.lst programs to follow suit.
"II we do well, it will be obvious
to other programs that success is .1
possibility." I'hlfeldei said. "Our
program will hopefiilh be a spring
board and a spark lor lacrosse
growth 011 the West ( 0.15t."

I raditionally, the West Coast
has suffered in lacrosse because

I lowevei, I hlfelder's presence is
already attracting talent. In her

I J.S. lac rosse.
I wist was quoted 111 the Balti

"Obviously, it is not historically a

"The student-athlete is coming

The Stanford women's lacrosse team celebrates after its upset victory against Vanderbilt earlier this year. Under the
guidance of new head coach Michele Uhlfelder this year, the squad had its best season in Stanford history.
A Iburth-consecutive Women's Western
lacrosse League title, a perfect WWLL
record, wins against top-ranked teams and
a first-ever national ranking all contributed
to making this season the best in Stanford
women's lacrosse history.
I lie mastermind behind this impressive
display was Stanford's new head coach,
Michele Uhlfelder. In her first season at

Stanford, Uhlfelder was able to combine
her experience and passion for the game to
make great strides in the ('.ardinal women's
lacrosse program.
"We were very excited to be able to get
Michele," said Asst. Athletics Director Karl
Koberlein. "We knew that it would be a
statement to the lacrosse community, and
she really exceeded our expectations."
Uhlfelder brings a wealth of coaching
experience to the Farm. She came to Stan
ford this year from Duke, where she was the

associate head coach List season. I 'hllelder
previously held positions .is the assistant
coach at Duke for one season and at Old
Dominion for lour seasons.
The experienced coach is no stranger to
the national spotlight. In her seven yeai s <>l
Division I coaching, she has been the dri
ving force behind a 1999 l iiial Font squad,
a (Conference (championship team in 199")
and six All-American selections.
Uhlfelder''s experience as a player is also
marked bv success. As a member t >1 the I SA

National team since 1991. Uhlfelder has
continued to be a competitive forte in the
laciosse community. Since 1991, she has
been a member of the U.S. Elite team and
has competed internationally on the C ireat
Britain and Australian louring teams.
Currently, I hllelder is one of 24 players
competing lor one of the 16 spots on the
2001 World ('.up team, which will compete
in England in July.
In her collegiate career, I hllelder was a
four-year starter and captain of the

women's lacrosse team during lier senioi
year ai Maryland. Maryland lacrosse has .1
reputation of excellence in the national
arena, and Uhllelder helped lead the Ter
rapins to national runner-up finishes in
both 1990 .ukl 1991. In hei senior year,
Uhllelder was distinguished as a First I earn
All-Amcrican and the National Oflensive
Player of the Year.
Traditionally, West (loast lacrosse has
been .1 step behind the Kast in the
lacrosse community. However,
L'hlfelder s presence is turning
heads. I ler background, combined
with her vision foi West Coast
lac rosse, helped the Stanford team
become the first West (oast team to
break into the Intel collegiate
Women's Lit rosse (1 >ac hesAssc >t i
ation top-20 ranking.
"West ( o.lst Lac rosse is like sit
ting on .1 gold mine. I hlielder
said. "It is a time bomb waiting to
go off ."
I hlielder may be the one re
sponsible for igniting this time
bomb, as the siimc-ss of her pro
gram will hopelulK t.iuse other
West ( o.lst programs to follow suit.
"II we do well, it will be obvious
to other programs that success is .1
possibility." I'hlfeldei said. "Our
program will hopefiilh be a spring
board and a spark lor lacrosse
growth 011 the West ( 0.15t."
I hlfelder's t ommitinent to

I raditionally, the West Coast
has suffered in lacrosse because

I lowevei, I hlfelder's presence is
