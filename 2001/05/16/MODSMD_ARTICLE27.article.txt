leading the Philadelphia 70ers to the best record in
lhe l'.ast and their best season in 10 years.
"It's special because of everything I went through
last summer," Iverson said. "I had to lot»k in the mir
ror <md see things 1 didn't do right as a person or a
plaver. I promised myself when I look in the mirror
after ilns season, I'll know I did everything right."
Iverson got 1,121 points to beat out San Antonio's
I im Duncan (700 points) and Los Angeles' Shaquille
()'Ncal, last year's winner, who had 578 points from
the panel of sportswritcrs and broadcasters in the
United States and Canada.
I he award taps an ama/ing turnaround for Iver
son. who was nearly traded last summer because of his
contentious relationship with Brown.
But Iverson promised to change his ways before
training camp opened and lived up to it, taking over as
team captain, playing unselfishly and becoming a
leader on the court.
"It's one of the neatest things I've ever seen happen,
when von think of the way he was thought of five years
ago and the way this franchise was perceived and what
lie's done to put us where we are and the change in
him." Brown said. "1 le'snot only the best player on the
team, he's become a great teammate. I'm like a proud
lather watching him develop and the way he plays and
to recognize the heart he has."

an afternoon news conference, Iverson said he won
dered if he'd ever reach this point.
"I didn't know because of all the baggage I tame
here with," Iverson said. "I was 20 years old and peo

I never stopped and worked on all the things people
said I couldn't do and now I'm the MVPof the league.
It's something I always wanted."
