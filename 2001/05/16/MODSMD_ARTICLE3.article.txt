Renowned solar physicist Arthur Walker
died A} nil 2'.) ol cancer in his home on cam
pus. Walker, (i4, had served as a professor of
physics .md applied physics at Stanford since
lÂ«) 74. He was fx'st known for groundbreak
ing work in developing methods to capture
images ol I lie snn, as well as being a strong
supporter of under-represented students in
i lie sciences.
\\ alker was instrumental in bringing Stan
lord to the national lorelront of educating
graduate students from minority groups in
phvsics. Main ol his formei students, which
itu lude Sally Ride, the first American woman
in space, sa\ they regard Walker as a friend as
well as ,i mentor.
"Art's brilliance made him a great scientist,

and his warm heart made him a great friend,"
said engineering research associate Dennis
Martine/-( ialarce, who was both Walker's si u
dent and colleague. "What made him a great
adviser, in addition to these qualities, was the
faith he had in his students, as he had an un
canny ability to make his students perform

convinced otherwise."

Cleveland. In l ( .). r )<H, Walker finished his mas
ter's degree in phvsics .it the University of Illi
nois <ind continued at the school to earn a
doctorate in physics in 1902.
