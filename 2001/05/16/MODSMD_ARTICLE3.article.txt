### CAROLYN LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Renowned solar physicist Arthur Walker
died A} nil 2'.) ol cancer in his home on cam
pus. Walker, (i4, had served as a professor of
physics .md applied physics at Stanford since
l«) 74. He was fx'st known for groundbreak
ing work in developing methods to capture
images ol I lie snn, as well as being a strong
supporter of under-represented students in
i lie sciences.
\\ alker was instrumental in bringing Stan
lord to the national lorelront of educating
graduate students from minority groups in
phvsics. Main ol his formei students, which
itu lude Sally Ride, the first American woman
in space, sa\ they regard Walker as a friend as
well as ,i mentor.
"Art's brilliance made him a great scientist,

and his warm heart made him a great friend,"
said engineering research associate Dennis
Martine/-( ialarce, who was both Walker's si u
dent and colleague. "What made him a great
adviser, in addition to these qualities, was the
faith he had in his students, as he had an un
canny ability to make his students perform
llie impossible when they themselves were
convinced otherwise."
In H)N(), President Ronald Reagan selected
Walker to serve on a commission investigating
the explosion of the space shuttle (.hallenger.
A year later, Walker's work brought him
greater recognition among astrophysicists,
lie created telescopes that were mounted on
rockets and launched into space to obtain \-
t ay images of the sun. I sing special thin films
developed by Stanford materials scientist
I Toy Barbee, Walker successfully captured
the first detailed pictures of the Sun's corona.

A native of (Cleveland, ()hio, VValkei 's last i
nation with science bewail at an early age. He
graduated Irom the Bronx High School of
Science and earned his bachelor's degree in
physics from ('.ase Institute of I ethnology in
Cleveland. In l ( .). r )<H, Walker finished his mas
ter's degree in phvsics .it the University of Illi
nois <ind continued at the school to earn a
doctorate in physics in 1902.
In the same year, Walker became a first
lieutenant in the I'.S. Air Forte and created
it)t>ls lor experiments involving the Karth's
magnetit field at the Air Force Weapons Lab
oratory.
After his stint in the military, Walker joined
the Spate Physics Laboratory of the Aero
space (Corporation. I here, he studied the Sun
and the Karth's upper atmosphere before
leaving for Stanford.
At Stanford, Walker became
not only a well-loved professor,
but also "the informal leader of
the black faculty for many
years," according to John Rick
ford, director ol the African and
Afro-American Studies Pro
gram. "(Walker was) the one
who called us together from
time to time to discuss issues ol
interest and concern, like the
hiring and retention of black
faculty or how to reach out to

and respond to the needs ol our
students," Ricktord said.
Rick ford also pointed to Walk
