## Intel chairman gives talk on the future of the Internet 
### NINA CANN-WOODE STAFF WRITER 
Do you believe in the value of
paranoia? Perhaps it's a catch
phrase that some Stanford stu
dents might proscribe to dur
ing midterm season, but it's also
something Andy drove believes in.
In his four decades in Silicon Val
ley, Intel's 64-year-old chairman
and former chief executive officer
has seen a lot of what success can do
to a company.
Dressed in a dark turtleneck,
wide-waled corduroys and a stylish
leather jacket, Time magazine's
1997 "Man of the Year" spoke with
c andor and insight on May 10 to a
packed audience in Bishop Audito
rium about Intel's transition into a
new age of computing, his own ca
reer in Silicon Valley and the na
ture of the New Economy.
Is ihe economy really as "new"
.> sonic p'a port it to be, or is it just
slilul thinking on the part of
Wall Street hypesters? Ask Cirove,
and he'll say it's a combination of
both. While at odds with the New
Economy's nomenclature, drove
said he's a believer in most of its
goals: a world in which innovation
and real-time communication is
more important than mass pro
duction and a world where rapid
change is constant.
"That phrase you hate: The In
ternet changes everything.' The
opposite extreme: 'The Internet
changes nothing.' So, then, what
does the Internet change?" asked
John Heilemann, special corre
spondent for Wired magazine,
who interviewed Grove on stage.
"It does something in between,"
(irove said. "It changes everything,
and it changes nothing. Does it

change iht* fundamentals of suppK
and demand? No, but it does bring
customer management with com
puters alive. The notion that sup
pliers are going to be interconnec t
ed in real time will streamline and
improve supply-chain manage
ment."
"[The Internet] also makes
everything faster," (irove contin
ued. "Genomics discoveries
come faster. You can crack data
faster. You can build and correct
supply lines faster. You can get
information faster. E-mail lias
absolutely changed interperson
al and inter-company communi
cation in a fairly profound wav.
That phrase Internet time' —
that's real. I used to laugh .it my
friends who are dot tors f'oi being
tethered to their beepers. Well,
that's all of us now. But everv
tliing being faster also has enor
mous benefits. I lie most direct
way of increasing productivity is
doing the same thing in a lesser
period of time — turning things
faster. And productivity is the
key to everything — greater pro
ductivity increases economic
growth."
At the heart of drove's assess
ment is a "rational exuberance"
for the Internet, a phrase which
happens to also be the title of an
upcoming issue of Wired, 112 or a
man whose "self-advertised para
noia" and "withering skepticism"
are all too well known in the
trades, "rational exubet ance" is a
generous compliment. Believe
the hype.
Heilemann knows (irove is not
one to dish approval easily. For six
months, he was refused an inter
\iew with drove for an upcoming
book 011 Silicon Yallev. Finally, in

the summer ol 1998 and after
countless recjuests, Heilemann
met with (irove over lunch to
pitch his plans.
"It was the most amazing meet
ing, Heilemann said. "Andy b.isi
callv told me the idea I had lor my
book was terrible. I said, 'No,
vou're wrong, and I'm going to
show vou win. I wouldn't gi\e up.
We went .it it Ibi about two hours,
and linalh Andv agreed to let me
interview him lor my book. I've
been working with him now lot
about three s< >11< 1 veai s. I Ir s,i won
der! it I pel s< .n — lu-\ fresh, he's tun
and he- intei views very well.

"And, you know what? One of
Andy's friends told me later ili.it
those si\ months of rejection were
|usi a test. 11 1 had folded — ill had
given up — I wouldn't he the kind
< >1 person Andy would have wanted
i<> work with anyway."
drove has survived life-threat
ening starlet fever, deafness, liv
ing behind the "Iron durtain,"
and prostate cancer. With each
new c i isis. drove — born Andras
(irofii.i Budapest, 1 lungary — has
learned a lesson about adaptation,
weighing risks and being de< isive,
skills ih.ii lie .said helped him ma
neuvei i<> the lop ol the semicon

due tot business.
"1 |ust [concentrate] on doing
what I need to do," Grove told
myprimetime.com. "l or every ac
tion that has a risk associated with
it, there's a countervailing risk ass<>-
ciated with not taking the action.
Not taking action may be an even
higher risk."
(irove has often been c ailed a vi
sionary In the press, though he ab
solutely refused the label, even ol
"an industry where the honorific
'visional")"' is applied as liberally as
lip gloss in Holly wood." as Heile
mann wrote in Wired magazine's
feature on (irove.

"Once, we were talking about
Intel's invention of tlie micro
processor in 1971, and 1 noted
that Grove's mentor, Gordon
Moore, had described it at the
time as 'one of the most revolu
tionary products in the history of
mankind.' Lobbing a blimp-sized
Softball of a question, 1 asked
Grove if he'd seen the chip's po
tential with equal clarity. I didn't,'
he replied with a moment's hesita
tion. I was running an assembly
line designed to build memory
chips. I saw the microprocessor as
a bloody nuisance.'"
Over the years, Grove has
taught classes at UC-Berkeley, in
house at Intel and, currently, a
seminar titled "Strategy and Ac
lion in the Information Process
ing Industry" at Stanford's Grad
uate School of Business.
But through it all. Grove has
maintained a zero-tolerance for
hype <ind industry hyperbole.
"I'm often credited with the
motto, 'Only the paranoid sur
vive," he wrote in his book "Only
the Paranoid Survive." "I have
no idea when I first said this,
but the fact remains that, when
it comes to business, 1 believe in
the value of paranoia. Business
success contains the seeds of its
own destruction. The more suc
cessful you are, the more people
want a chunk of your business
and then another chunk and
then another until there is noth
ing left."
"[The increased pace of tech
nological change] will have an im
pact on you, no matter what you
do fora living. It will bring new
competition from new ways ol
doing things, from corners you
don't expect."
