"Techies" and "fuzzies" united al the third an
nual Silicon Valley Conference on Non-profits

and technology
on May 8 and
May 9 at the
Fairmont Hotel
in San Jose. The
techies were
mostly there to
find fulfilling
work and the
lu//ies to learn
valuable (ethni
cal skills. The
conference was
to serve as a vehi
cle to discuss the
role of technolo
gy in nonprofit
organizations.
"In a hot econ
omy, people feel

the need to get a high-paying job and save money,
C.J. Van Pejt, the executive director of Cisco Sys
tems's charitable foundation, said at one panel. "Hut
now they can go out and do something that's really
meaningful for them."
Two organizations represented at the conference,
(k)mpuMentor and 1 landsNct, are part of the effort to
bridge the digital divide that separates technology
companies from nonprofit organizations. Civen limit
ed resources and immediate needs, nonprofits often
underprioritize technological development. I lowever,
nonprofit leaders who attended the conference sav
they hope to change this trend. They said they view
technology as the key to future success, lx>th for them
selves and for their clients.
CompuMentot helps nonprofit organizations and
schools find technology consultants willing to work
pro bono or at a reduced rate. I*ist week, it celebrat
ed the one-year anniversary of a successful side pro
ject, TechSoup.org. a Web portal that delivers tec h
nology information to nonprofits. "We're very proud
that it hasn't been a dot-bomb," said CompuMentor

I wo of the panels at the conference disc ussed how
