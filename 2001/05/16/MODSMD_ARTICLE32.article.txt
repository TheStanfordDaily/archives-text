# Depression can strike anyone
## 
### CAROLINE MOORE-KOCHLACS 
A particularly brutal
midterm cau leave you ques
tioning your academic abilities.

A fight with a close
friend may make
\<ni feel blue. A ro
mantit rejection
can mess with your
sell-esteem, (ien
erally, these feel
ings recede after a
few hours or days
as your life moves
on. A more stress
ful personal situa
tion. like a death
in the family, can
lead to what is de
fined .is situational
depression that,

though lasting
longer than a few days, often
comes to its own conclusion.
When depression is a long-term
stale — not related to a particu
lar situation and hindering a
pet son's ability to function — it
is often defined .is clinical de
pression.
Estimates from prominent
psychiatrist R.C. Kessler suggest
thai approximately 21 percent of
women and 13 percent of men
suffer from clinical depression at
some point in their lives. Unfor
tunately, less than half ol those
with clinical depression receive
professional help, writes D.A.
Regier in the Art hives of (icneral
Psychiatry. Those people who
are not treated could be 100 em
barrassed to seek help. It is im
portant for these people to un
derstand that clinical depression
is a treatable medical disorder.
A person with clinical depres
sion will often display warning
signs. I he Diagnostit Standard
Manual of Mental Disorders and
Counseling and Psychological

Services al C.owell say I hat these
signs can int hide a loss of interest
or pleasure in typical activities, a
sense of hopelessness or anxious
ness, poor appetite, sleeping too
unit li or too little, and agitated or
slow motor activity. One could

also experiente leelingsol worth
lessness, try spontaneously or
harbor thoughts of suicide.
Everyone has experienced some
of these symptoms, but depres
sion is of ten .1 question of degree
and frequency.
Most people who are de
pressed tit) not commit suicide,
but 50 to HO percent of suicides
are attempted bv people suffer
ing from depression, according
to UCLA psychiatrist Edwin
Shneidman.
Many suicide victims talk
about their intentions before I hey
attempt suicide, antl all talk of
suicide should be taken very seri
ously, especially il the speaker
has shown other signs of depres
sion. Suicide occurs more fre
quently with people who feel that
they have nowhere it) turn and is
often thought of as a desperate
cry for help.
I here has been some concern
about rising youth suicide rates
recently. But Allan Schwartz ol
the University of Rochester has

shown thai suicide rates are
lower lor college students than
lor their contemporaries who do
not attend college. Though this
is good news, a lower suicide rate
is still a suicide rate. It can hap
pen here.

Alter a failed
midterm, a light
with a friend or a
rejection, don't
isolate yourself.
Even though feel
ing down will
probably pass on
its own, there is
plenty you can do
to help yourself get
over it more quick
ly. Go fora walk,
('.all a friend. Go
fountain-hopping.
Relax.
