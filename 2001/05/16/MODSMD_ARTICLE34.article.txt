()vet the past two decades, sci
entisis have learned that all cancer
arises Irom genetic delec ts, often a
hall-do/en or more, that accuinu

glow rampantly and spread

Willi this insight came the belief
tli.it it might be possible to target
these bad genes to stop cancer. This
approach was oik c one ol the hottest
ideas in cancel 1 eseai < h. but enthu
siasm cooled as scientists came up
against roadblocks.
()uc ol the biggest ol these was

1 ells — a tall order — is not good
enough, because the rest keep
growing.
So researcheis decided th.it the
month might be .111 excellent target
fin gene therapy, since the problem
(.111 be so easil) reached. Dr. K/.ra
Cohen of the I niversitv of Chicago
reported the results ol testing on 10
patients at a meeting in San Franc is

I he advantage is that it's where
we i an see it. (iohen said. "We can
gel to it.and the therapy does not gel
absoibed into the lwwlv."
White or red patches in the
month, so-called dysplastic le
sions, frequently arc a forerunner
ol malignancy, and they arc com
mon in smokers and heavy
di inkers.
I liese cells typically contain

mutant genes, and one ol the most
c 0111111011, occurring in about half,
is a broken ps!l gene. I his is a
tumor-suppressor gene, and it or
dinarily kills cclls that contain
dangerous mutations. Without a
working copy ol this gene, the
mouth growths (.111 go on to be

Cohen and colleagues at M.I).
Anderson (lancet Ccntci in I lons
ton and the I niversit\ ol California
at San Francisco tested a gene-thcr
ap\ mouthwash developed by ()ny\
Pharmaceuticals, which financed
the study.
I he treatment consists ol aden
ovirus, a kind of cold virus, that
lac ks a working copy ol one gene
that ordinarily allows the virus to 111-
lec t c ells with good ps!t genes. With
out this gene, it should infect onl>
cells with damaged p53 genes. In
theory, at least, the crippled virus
will enter these precancerous cells
and kill them.
I he doc tors dec ided to conduct
the study after a promising start 111
one patient, a 2H-year-old woman
smoker with extensive patches 111
her mouth. After two brief rounds of
treatment, they disappeared, but
later they came back, this time as
cancer.
So now the doc tors are giving pa
tients the flavorless mouthwash
once a week for 12 weeks. I hose
who respond get another 12 weeks
of treatment.
So far, the patches have disap
peared completely in two of the 10
treated, one of them for nearly six
months. I hey have partially c leared
up in two others.
I he doc tors hope to test the ap
proach in 20 patients. If that goes
we 11, the next step will be experimen
tal treatment in people with especial
ly severe cases of precancerous
patches, as well as in those who al
ready have had mouth cancer and
risk recurrence.
"It makes sense, but it is very,
very preliminary," commented Dr.
Barbara Conley of the National
(lancer Institute. "But the good
part is that it is not toxic or onerous.
It's a mouthwash."
