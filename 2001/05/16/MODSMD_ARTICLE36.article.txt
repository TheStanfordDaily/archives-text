I he ministn said negative results did

More than 2.0 million animals have

been slaughtered in a campaign to eradi

ease. I .ivestoc k on inlet ted farms were or
dered killed within 24 hours of the dis
ease being confirmed at the site. Animals
on neighboring farms had to be killed
within two clays.
"Speed ol slaughter is erne ial to successful
control and eradication of the disease." the
ministn s.iid in a written statement. "Wait

taking action would risk not bringing the
outbreak under control."

An epidemic can only he considered

I hat was achieved by March HO, and ihr
score has been slowly declining since then,
according to the research.
"Any intensification or relaxation of con
