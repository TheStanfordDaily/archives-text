### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI 
Argentinos en Stanford coordinated with a
number of other campus organizations, in
cluding the ('-enter lor Latin American Stud
ies, the I iaas (.enter lor Public Service and the
ANSI Speakers Bureau, to launch a two-part
seminar on juvenile and adult detention in Ar
gentina yesterday.
In order to address this topic, the president
of Argent inos en Stanford, junior Victor ('.alo,
invited three of his former teachers from high
school, Alberto Florio, Jorge l at a and Martin
Snare/, to speak .it Stanford, As their student,
(.alo had the opportunity to enter state peni
tentiaries in Buenos Aires and interact with
the inmates as part of a school program, the
C.etedra Abierta Professor Alfredo Marcori
program.

"Alter seeing that SO percent of the inmates
in the prisons came from minors' institutes,
the program began to incorporate juvenile de
tention facilities into their visits," ('.alo said.
Fara said that this experience makes stu

sense of compassion toward those people who
are less fortunate themselves." I lie students
become so involved that they gather clothing
and other gifts for the prisoners with whom
they come into contact.
I he overall purpose of the Argentinos pro
gram's endeavors is to enter prisons and juve
nile detention facilities to educate the inmates
on problem-solving skills or poetry and to inter
act with them socially. The students and proles

taken on this project at the grassroots level.
Initially, they "had problems gaining access

to the inmates," according t<> Florio, but now
they have begun to gain recognition lor their
efforts.
In bringing the achievements of this pro
gram to Stanford, the founders and partici
pants say they have started to raise awareness
of this issue to a receptive audience. They have
also had the opportunity to reflect on the evo
lution of the program.
"Stanford is a community teaching center,
and one of the issues about education is how to
teach people who live in marginal situations.
This is <1 problem that affects a great number
of people around the world, and in Latin
America especially. I believe that Profs. Florio,
Fara and Suare/. are making alot of improve
ments in other people's lives, and I think it's a
