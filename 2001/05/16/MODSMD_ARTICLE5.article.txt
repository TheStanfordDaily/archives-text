## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a memo to faculty sent May
!t, Provost John Ktchemendy an
nounced that he had frozen cer
tain proposed Division of Lan
guages. Cultures and Literatures
resources until the Blue Ribbon
C ommittee resolves the proposed
divisional merger.
Ktchemendy appointed the
committee at the Faculty Senate
meeting on May .'5. He charged it
with drafting proposals to improve
the m\ departments that comprise
the division in an ellbrt to change
the status quo. 1 lie committee will
report to the provost and Sharon
Long, the new dean ol I luinanities
and Sciences, at thcctidofiall quar
ter 2001.
"Naturally, the commitments
made earlier this year in support ol
ilit- proposed reorganization of the
divisit >n — multiple senior searches,
funds for programmatic develop
ment |and soon | — have been taken
oil the table. Ihe decision about
what resources to commit moving
forward will have to be made by
Dean Long .it the end of this
process," Ktchemendy said.
"1 have also asked that (the
S< hool of I luinanities and Sciences)
freeze the two searches in Kuropean
literature currently underway until
the Inline organization ol the divi
sion has been decided."

Ftcheniendy said liiat ilit* Univer
sity would lx- unable to attract the
strongest candidates "with the cur
rent uncertainty alxmt the depart
ments they will Ik- joining."
Faculty protest
Many laculty members within
the division objected to
Ktchemendy's move.
"We were very taken aback at the
news our search was to be Irozen.
1 hese searches were authorized in
late summer, belbre the merger
proposal was even on the table, at
which time three additional search
es were promised if the merger
went through," said Pro!. Yvonne
Yatbrc>-Bejarano,chair of the Span
ish X: Portuguese Department.
"In the case ol Spanish & Por
tuguese. there is a long history to
this search; we have liecn trying to
hire a spec ialist in peninsular Span
ish literature lor six veais," she con
tinued. "This vear's search pro
duced an excellent senior c andidate
whom we unanimously support. 1 le
also has the enthusiastic support of
other (acuity in the division."
()t her divisional faculty speculat
ed th.it there might Ik- more than
the ostensible reason of administra
tive uncertainty lor halting the fac
ulty search.
"Theollici.il logic oft he Provost's
Ollice is that we can't make oilers
before you know what the adminis
trative framework is. But that isn't

really important; colleagues and
students are important. I think the
unofficial logic behind this move is
to get the faculty to reach some con
sensus." French and Italian Prof.
Sepp tiumbrechl said.
"I respect Etcheniendy a great
deal, but I disagree with him 011 two
things," Gumbrecht continued.
"We will never have a full consensus
among the laculty. It is the task ol
the provost to make a deci
sion ... As long as we have no solu
tion,a lot of action isabsorhed in this
very normal disagreement."
(iumbrecht said he worried
that, by waiting, Stanford ma\ lose
some of its top candidates for
these positions.
"It's very precarious. I he three
candidates we identified were all
very, very good, and we had live
others almost as good. II the\ accept
an oiler elsewhere, we don't know il
we'll get the same quality of people,"
he said.
Though (iumbrecht described
his support lor the merger .is virtu
ally unconditional, hesavsthat.illie
were forced to choose, between
three new faculty members and the
merger as the best w.iv to strength
en the division, he would choose
the faculty.
'Three world-class laculty are
more important than any structural
change," he said.

"We rec|iiested to meet with the

"We will never have a full consensus
among the laculty. It is the task ol
the provost to make a deci
sion ... As long as we have no solu
tion,a lot of action isabsorhed in this
very normal disagreement."
(iumbrecht said he worried
that, by waiting, Stanford ma\ lose
some of its top candidates for
these positions.
"It's very precarious. I he three
candidates we identified were all
very, very good, and we had live
others almost as good. II the\ accept
an oiler elsewhere, we don't know il
we'll get the same quality of people,"
he said.
Though (iumbrecht described
his support lor the merger .is virtu

were forced to choose, between
three new faculty members and the
merger as the best w.iv to strength
en the division, he would choose
the faculty.
'Three world-class laculty are
more important than any structural
change," he said.

Student input
I'ino— one of the students who
coordinated tlie- 71 M-signatlire peti
tion tli.it put the merger on the
m hcdulcof theApi il l ( .» f aculty Sen

pointment at the provost\ decision
not to include student input on his
Blue Ribbon (Committee.
"We rec|iiested to meet with the
provost about having input on the
formation of the Blue Ribbon (Com
mittee, .ind tli.it rccjucst t<> meet
with him was denied," I'ino said.
" I apprei iate the fin t that the\ ve

think tli.it it wouldn't Ik- a bad idea
to continue to ask for student input.
I lu- department is not |ust its fa< ill

Some students cited a lac k of siu
dent input as one of the original
problems with the niergei—one

Departments underresourced
"I think the departments are un
(lertnnded and nnderresoiirced
ac ross the board," Pino said. "I think
something ihey might want to keep
in mind is thai thev originally of

ministration might want to keep in
mind tli.it live searc hesac ross six de
partments still means that there will
be .in iiiii-cjii.il distribution ol re

And faculty billets ate not the
onlv resources these departments
need, ae cording to students.
"Foi departments that are al
