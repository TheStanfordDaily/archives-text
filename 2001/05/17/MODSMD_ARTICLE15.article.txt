It was at Minima camp one year \vlu*rc Anne
M< Donald established an everlasting bond with .1
hoi se named Frank.
"(He] was big, kind of stupid, I>lll I jii>t loved
him." recalled Mc Donald, a sophomore at Stan

ford. "1 had to lake care ol him. At first, he was sick,
so I gave him ineds and spent time with him. I was
prettv nun h the onlv one who realh liked him, so I
rode him the most."
I nfortunatelv, Frank went down with colic one
night, hill \1( Donald was there for her friend. I Ins
formed an unbreakable relationship that lasted
throughout the summer.
"I was realh worried and at tiialh spent the night
with him, petting him, talking 10 him and laving
next to him while he was down." she said. "H\ the
end of the summer, he'd follow me around wher
ever I'd go, even if 1 jumped over a small jump,
he'd come right over, cute as t an be."
Mi Donald's stor\ is prohabb not one Ih.lt most
Stanford students can relate to, but there are a
handful of students — l ( .) of them, in fact — who
can definiteh see her point.
I hese 1 ( .) students, who represent all foui c l.iss

According to sophomore Ana l.oinbeia. the
president of the team, eijuesti tan is ili\ ided up into
