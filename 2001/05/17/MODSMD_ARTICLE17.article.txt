## The
						Stanford Daily Movie to promote alumni giving misses the mark

Published Since IS')I

N" ( > < )Nl\ I X )l l> I S tilt* HllpOl tan<e of
alumni giving. Donations are essen
ii,il to the maintenance and expan
sion of an\ universitv. At Stanford,
though, it appeals that the need to increase
alumni giving lias taken over the campus — lit
eralh I lie (lanipaign loi I ndergraduate Kdil
eal ion is current 1\ filming a movie about under
graduate life to help in< lease giving. I )espite the
good intentions of the project, the effort is mis
directed. besides being intrusive in its produc
tion, the film is ,in inellu ient way to elicit dona
lions from alumni.
I he film project is no low-budget Sony
I land wain production. It is Stanford opulence
at its absolute best. I lie film employs a big-time
11< )ll\ w<>(kl produclion coinpanv, a d<>uble cani
era rig, !t. r >-millinicicr film, high-definition
video, time-lapse photograpln and two-screen
displa\ to produce a "(linerania elled. I hat isa

whole lot of monev being spent to get alumni to
get Stanlord even more money.
But why does Stanford have to spend sik Ii .i
large amount of monev on a movie about un
dergraduate life in ordei to increase alumni giv
ing? I lie theon is that, the more con net led and
appreciative alumni leel toward llieii school, the
more willing thev will be to give inone\ to that
school afiei they graduate. If alumni giving is
low, then thai means people do not leel .1 strong
bond to their school. If alumni giving is high,
then the school is doing a good job of creating a
secure (ommunitv. I he correlation is prett\
straightforward.
I he epic scaleof this 11 1<>vieseems to he Irving
to compensate foi a lac k of alumni connection to
Stanford. flic lad thai the I niversitx is spend
ing hundreds of thousands of dollai s 1 < > < reate a
grand film that is supposed to remind alumni of
how miK Ii thc\ loved Stanford ignores the real

issue here — th.it perhaps Stanlord alumni are
not ovei l\ excited to fund ink lei graduate edu
cation at this I nivei sit\ because the\ just do not
feel obligated to do so.
Kven il .ilunini giving is alread\ high here
,iii(l ihe movie is supposed to be the extra push
to 1 each the billion-dollar maik, the I niversit\
could still (01 lie up with more efficient and less
< ostl\ ways of elic iling don.itions from alumni.
Wh\ not make .1 film about specific academic
conflicts and developments, the needs of ethnic
communities and the struggles ol students who
might need more resources and opportunities
to realh benefit Itom Stanford? Alter all, these
are part ol the real reason win the I niversity
seeks more funding and wh\ alumni would
want to give more donations — namely, to en
sine that the community is being improved.
Ihe (111 rent film ovei looks these issues to focus
instead on pine aesthetics.

I lie film's representation of undergraduate
lilc also raises questions. ()n normal days here,
undergraduates do not sing in front ol Memori
al Church .11 I I pan. wearing ball gowns. Stu
dents do not perform choreographed dances at
dusk in the middle of White Ha/a. And students
do not naturalh stand foi hours on end pre
tending to talk to people tlu'V had never before
met jiist so that the school appears to he a cor
dial plate.
1 he point of the film is to "capture the unique
qualities" of the I niversitv, not to create false
moments. While n is important for the Universi
t\ to push foi alumni giving, such efforts should
not force a sense of false connection or apprecia
tion onto alumni. Rathci than sa\ingthat alum
ni should give hat k localise of what Stanford has
done foi them, the I niversitv should convince
.tlumni to give back so that Stanford can be a bet
tei place loi all students, stafl and .iluinni.
