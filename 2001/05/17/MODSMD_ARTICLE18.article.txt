As a culture, we re all obsessed with
numbers. K<>\s have alwa\s fell the in
n.ite need to rate girls on a 10-point

the nuinbei of shoes tliev have and bow

Numbers give us a sense ol power. In
the world of numbers, we are lull\ in con
trol. Willi words, we often sa\ what we
don't mean, tell hall-truths, argue about
ambiguous meanings and debate over
unclcat statements. Sometimes, words
just don't come out right, even with no
malice on our part. Novelists often sav
that readers impute meanings and intents
to their words that the\ weren't aware ol
at the time of writing.
In contrast, numbers have dear, pre
cise meanings that brook no dispute,
hven though Mark I wain lamoush
(laimcd, " I here are lies, damned lies and
statistics," numbers Ibol onl\ those who
have not taken Statistic 100. We are in
( otnplete control of what numbet s mean.
When I say, "Dude, I'm taking 25 units
this quarter," I don't mean 20. I nlike
words, numbers don t runawa\ and take
on a life of their own.
Numbers are eminently susceptible

i<> lational analysis and manipulation.
You max disagree with mx interpreta
tion ol |(>seph (.our.id's novels, but we
(.in both agree on the correct wax to
add. subtract and calculate probabili
ties. I here are definite answers, rather
than an inlinilch multiplying range ol
subje< l ixc interpretations. In the world
ol numbers, xvc led like there's real
knowledge, not just argument and

because xvc have this xveird leeling ol
iclial)ilit\ xxlicn it ionics to numbers, wi
ll.ixc an urge to quantifx even the most
un-numbei'like things m an i-llori to uu
<lci si. ind llicin. Whin Luropeans of the
c.u Ix modern period set sail into the dark,
unknown world, (hex divided the xvorld
into lines ol latitude and longitude, en
closing everything in closelx numbered
squares. I lie grid ol the map was com
fortable. Numbers were sccuritx in the
liicc ol dangei.
Now, we di-plox numbers in an dlori
to understand such things as cultui.il bi
ases. political prestige, honor, love and
war. We even eniplox an entire (lass ol
people lo do prc( isclx this task. ('.all tlietn
social scientists. Large-sample data sets,
statistical regressions and quantifying
preferences on a stale ol 1 (st rough
agree) lo 7 (strongly disagree) are the
tools of ilieii trade. Numbers (an help us
understand even morality and ethics.

Kver■-greater quantification is I fie for

It is also aesthetic progress, l inberto
Leo reports that a group of writers in Paris
is devoted to produce literature In means
ol mathematical combinatorics. It has con
structed a matrix of .ill possible murder
slot x situations and has found tli.it no one
has yet written a book in which the mur
derer is the reader.
I he greatest triumph of numbers has
been removing beauty from the eve of the
beholder. II Helen of I toy was the lace
that launched a thousand ships, then a
"inilli-1 lelen" is the precise amount of
beauty required to launch a single ship.
And if numbers can conquer even beauty,
