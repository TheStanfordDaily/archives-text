"Linda Evans w.is in jail for 10 years,"
I a s.iid. "So we need loask, what crime was

ted genoc ide against thousands ol people

Evans .tlso fielded cjuestions. Junior
l'etei St.iii asked about her decision to
bomb buildings in Washington,
D.C.
"In a movement intended to
reduce the amount of implicit vio
lence in our society, when is vio
lence an acceptable strategy?"
Stair asked.
Kvans responded by explain
ing that, contrary to violence used
by other groups, the efforts ot Stu
dents tor .1 Democratic Societv
were specifically motivated bv
their vision for true cqualitv and
justice in society and to keep phvs
ical harm at .1 minimum, rather
than goals such as economic gain
or white supremacy.
"Armed struggle was not the
first thing anyone was trving to
do," Kvans said. "We were at
tempting to gain national libera
tion and defeat U.S. imperialism.
1 believe that people have the

right to use armed struggle, al
though it is not necessarily the
most appropriate strategy to use."
Kvans also disc ussed SKAS's
current campaign to stop the
building of a new prison in De
lano. Kvans said that she- sees
the effort as one that attempts to
remove the cushion between
Stanford students and the rest
of (California.

heat a political prisoner in per

means to be able to hear people
who have led lives like hers,
