Perhaps most importantly,
the t ha in e to win an NCAA title
is losing its appeal. While there
will alwavs be plavers such as
Duke's Shane Battier and \1 it lii
gan St.lie's Charlie Hell, who i e

I hev have been replaced by a
dream ol instant stardom and
riches in the professional ranks.
lot those plaveis who are
standouts at smaller schools —
such as Rodnc\ White ol Char
lotte and Sir Valiant Brown ol
Ceorge Washington — it is hard
to weigh the prospei t ol winning
a iniil-m.tjot conference and
maybe making a run into the sec
ond round ol the N( A \ I ourna
ment against the opportunity to
make millions and be part ol an
NHA franchise.
Imagine how different the Ins
lor\ of college basketball would
be if superstars such as Lew Al
( indor. Bill Walton, David
I hompson .ind Michael Jordan
had decided to make the leap
straight to the pros. (loai lies like
|olin Wooden, Adolpli Rupp
and Dean Smith might not be
household names.
I n math respects, this drain ol
talent is slowb killing the game
ol (ollege basketball.

and Kobe Brvanl, all of whom
made the jump sti.light from
high school to the pros and are

now counted among the game s
best plaxcis. has onl\ increased
the desire <>1 talented high school
players to test their late in the
murky watet sol the NBA.
lodav's college superstars
are surrounded l>\ s\(ophant
agent wannabes and hangers
on, who tout the plavci s every
move, often building their egos
to unbeliev.ible si/es. 1 he\
ncvei think ol I.eon Smith —
whose personal troubles forced
him out ol the game before he
could ever suit up for the Mav
ericks — ot |onathan Bender —
who has endured a two-\ear
stmt on the bench since lea\ing
high s( liool.
()necanonl\ hopeth.it the six
si hoolers and all the under

Shareel Abdui Raliini and |err\
Stackhouse, .ill ol whom skipped
\e.tis ol college to lind stardom
in the NBA.
We must also ask ourselves
what we can do to prevent this
ever-iiu l easing I rend.
I here are a numbei ol possi
ble solutions, tanging Ironi pay
ing stipends to college athletes to
putting a minimum age require
ment on eligibilitv lot the draft.
All of these solutions continue to
be debated bv the NBA and the
NCAA, though action still has
not been taken.
Yet, as long as the linant ial in
centives remain and nothing can
be done to somehow int l ease t he
intangible value of playing for
four years in college, it is nnlike
l\ that we will see a reversal in
this ti t-iid.
Ihe N( ;A-\ .iikl NBA must
l(»ok deep into the roots ol this
problem — roots that extend
into America's c< mini unities and
schoolbo\ basketball institu
tions. Ihe answer will not be
simple, but. in the interest of
preserving the glorious tradi
tion of college basketball, it is
one that must Ik- found.
