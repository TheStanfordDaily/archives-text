I low do vow review the 111 It C.D I'rom an ai cotnplished
hand? I've rareh seen a had review ol Nick (lave and the
Bad Seeds, hnt almost nothing about "No More Shall We
I'art" is immediate!) appealing Whereas it is refreshing
dial (lave s approat h to niusit is unorthodox, his voice is
medio( ie at best and his imisu is preach).
In Ins 20-vear < areer, ( ave has lived in Bet lin, Los An
geles, Bra/il and I,ondon, to name .1 lew. In each, he has
left Ins mark. I lis accomplishments include a s< reenplav
l«»i the movie "(.hosts . . . ol the ( i\ il 1 )ead, a < atneo in
Willi Wenders's t l.tssit lilm "Wings of Desire" and at ouple
ol volumes ol I\ 1 its and plavs.
I here's no <11 u-si i< >11 that (lave is good at what he t locs.
Music, til v. "No More Shall We I'art" is 1 •< li in composition,
Icaluriug siring arrangements as well .is lavered backup
vocals. I lit* alhttin relies hcavilv upon (lav t-'s piano stv lings
aslvrital settings lot his hall.ids. Pet haps most impressive
ahont "N<> More Shall We Part is that the (ID jacket is
tilled with pages ol lyrit s, with onlv one modest picturc ol
the group.
I lie major it v ol the alhtint lingers tm themes ol love and
(iotl. In its strongest moments, sut h as the album's open
er. "As I Sal Satlh H\ I let Sitle," (lave delivers delicaielv
t'i>llsti'l it led l\ lit al beauties such as, "Solil\ she spoke these
wotds to tne And with brant I new eves, open wide /We
pressed our lat<s 10 the glass As I sal satllv In hei side.
Another strong moment tut tit sin "(.ales Id The (i.u
tlen," when (lave sings, "Leave these ancient places I«> the
angels / I ,et the saints at lent! to theii keeping ol the t at he
tit als/ Ant I leave the tie,id beneath the ground so it >ld lor
(>od is in litis hand that I hold."
(lave s ettflit lit personalis shines through in "()li M\
1 .ord, a willv song that unlolds in ,t stream ol t oust iousness.
(lave "Now I'm at the hairdresseis People wait li 11 if
as tliev move past \ guv wearing plastit antlers/Presses his
bum against the ulass / Now I'm down on niv hands and

knees/And ii's mi hit hot / Someone(l les. 'What are you
looking lor?' /1 sc ream. 'I he plot, the plot!' "
However, songs siuh as "I lallelujah" and "(iod Is In
I lie I louse" .ire reminiscent ol public at ( ess televangelists.
In "Fifteen Feet ol I'ure White Snow." die sec ond single oil
the allium. (lave asks us to. "R.iise your hands up to the sk\
Raise your hands up to the skv/ Is it anv wonder?/ ()h. ni\
lord." Need I itic lude Ivric s lor "(iod Is In I he I louse"?
"No More Shall We Part" is the kind of allium that will
grow on you. but it doesn't beg to he listened lo once you've
set it down.


Tarantino turned us down, so we decided to form a band
