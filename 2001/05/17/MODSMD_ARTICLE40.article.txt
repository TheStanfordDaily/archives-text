Crush, a (|uasi-indnstrial rock band from Canada, is no

All the songs on the album are around three or four
minutes long and share similai themes, both musically

voice that makes the band lik.ible, even il its lyric sand

truly great album requires far more than that.


We may be from the same country as Bryan Adams, but
we are much cooler, you hosers. Take off, eh!
