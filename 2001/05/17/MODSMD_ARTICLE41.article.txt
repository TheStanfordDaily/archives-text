# "At Any Rate"
## Too Bad Eugene 
### Jung Lah, Staff Writer 
l lif Santa Cruz three-piece hand, T<x> Bad Eugene,
formed in 1998 and recently released its first album, "At
Any Rate," on Rock City Recording Company — an
indie lahel started by the well-known punk band Mxpx.
If 100 Bad Eugene shares a lot of characteristic!* with
Mxpx, it is no coincidcnce. Mike Herrera, Mxpx's lead
singer, produced "At Any Rate" and sang backup vocals
on several tracks with Mxpx drummer Yuri Riley. Riley
did some drum work on the album, too.
file two bands have toured together, further
more. Too Bad Eugene has the tendency to insert bla
tentlv annoying ( hrisiiaii references in its song lyrics
a ia earlv Mxpx. But that is not to say that "At Any
Rate" is a bad record. It is solidly average, with a dri
ving rot k 'n' roll leeling that justifies the band's stated
influences, whit It range from Bad Religion to U2.

hard-core vocalist.

that whole preaching factor. It
might be personal preference,
hut I don't really feel like the
punk rock I listen to should be
telling me that, "When God gives
you his grace, he knows that
you'll still sin," (as Too Bad Eu

having Christian-themed songs
doesn't make .1 hand had. But too
much Biblical action can turn oil
a lot of listeners in the same way a
straight-edge band always pro
nouiK iug drugs and promiscuity

To be fair, maybe it's just my
own biases kicking in — ultra left

when taking into account punk
rock's origins as a vehicle for so

a bit out of place. Nevertheless,
