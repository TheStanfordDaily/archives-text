l lif Santa Cruz three-piece hand, T<x> Bad Eugene,
formed in 1998 and recently released its first album, "At
Any Rate," on Rock City Recording Company — an
indie lahel started by the well-known punk band Mxpx.
If 100 Bad Eugene shares a lot of characteristic!* with
Mxpx, it is no coincidcnce. Mike Herrera, Mxpx's lead
singer, produced "At Any Rate" and sang backup vocals
on several tracks with Mxpx drummer Yuri Riley. Riley
did some drum work on the album, too.
file two bands have toured together, further
more. Too Bad Eugene has the tendency to insert bla
tentlv annoying ( hrisiiaii references in its song lyrics
a ia earlv Mxpx. But that is not to say that "At Any
Rate" is a bad record. It is solidly average, with a dri

influences, whit It range from Bad Religion to U2.
