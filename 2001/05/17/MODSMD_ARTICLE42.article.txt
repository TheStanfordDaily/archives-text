# 'Cabaret': All the world's a nudie bar, old chum

### HILARY BIENSTOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Lift' is a cabaret, old chum /
(.oiiß- join the cabaret." These words
present a very different image of
1930s C.er-

many from
what most
Americans
usually
imagine —
not die gray
country of
political con
lusion and
deva 1 u e d
I) e u t c h -
marks, but
instead the
Iras h y ,
gaudy linery
of Berlin's
e(|uivalent ol
the l ender
loin District.

"Cabaret" is a tale of excess, de
bauchery and gaiety (in .ill senses of
the word). And, like all fiiiry tales, the
story is too good to last.
"Cabaret" begins with the ar
rival of Clifford — an American
novelist — in Berlin, searching for
inspiration for bis new novel. ln

stead, he finds the steamy, seamy
underground of the Ku Rat Club
— and in particular Sally Bowles,
the nightclub's main act — who
promptly moves in with him.
When Sallv discovers she's preg-

nant, C Jill is inspired to marry her
.ind act more like a responsible fa
ther. but Sally would rather abort
the child and move on with her life.
Meanwhile, boarding-house
owner and spinster Fraulein Schei
der is conducting an affaire du
coeurwith the Jewish greengrocer,

Herr St hull/. Of
course, into ibis
tableau (and. indeed,
all the other lives in the
play), the specter of
Nazism makes its dis
turbing appearance.
I he standout star of
the show is Sallv,
played by a wonderful
ly talented Andrea
McArdle. With her
powerlul voice. vamp
ish good looks and
brassv demeanor, she

lit 1 11 > the stage. She displayed pre
cisely the right degree <>l confi
dence, languorousness and de
pressed «onfnsion at .ill the appro
priate moments.
hut the unsung hero of the
show is the emcee, played b\ Jon
Peterson. He serves as the show's
Zeitgeist — performing in risque
cabaret numbers, playing bit parts
and in general moving the show
along — though his wasn't a dra
matic character per se. Still, his
strong voice and ability to he a com
manding presence or a mere noth
ing. as the moment demanded,
was impressive.
The production .it the ()r
-plieuni was an inspired rendition.

l a< h inembei of the orchestra also
served as an actor, .111 impressive
feat .k coinplished b\ an extremeK
talented cast. As the emcee put it.
"f.ven the orchestra is beautiful!"
fhe orchestra was positioned on
the second level ol the two-story
set, allow ing us to watch the pla\ers
as the) rearranged themselves be
tween numbers, rushing up and
down the spiral staircases on either
side of the stage.
fhe simple set was effortlessly
transformed into a nightclub, the
back room of the Kit Rat (Huh and
Cliffs liny boarding-house bed
room, all In using set pieces carried
by members of the cast.
"Cabaret" seems the perfect

show to perforin in San Francisco.
With its locus on debauchery, al
ternative sexuality and particularly
risque sight gags in some of the
cabaret's numbers (for example,
"Two Ladies"), Bay Area residents
should feel at home.
Hut. for .ill its lightlu-arted
raunchiness, "Cabaret" raises
some disturbing issues. Mow
could Nazism arise in the midst ol
sue h social liberalism? And, given
that it did arise, what was am one
person's responsibility for it?
What happens if no one takes re
sponsibility? What constitutes
heroism, and what constitutes es
(apisin? And if such a thing could
happen in IWtliu of 19.'W, could n
happen in San Francisco today?
Despite its initial impression,
"(iabaret" is ,i show ili.it will leave
von thinking hard about some un
pleasant issues. But, along the
way, you'll be invited to the raciest
party around, including invigo
rating music, innovative and ellec
tive staging, .uid a cast of very tal

miss the thrills — and chills — ol
"(.abaret."
