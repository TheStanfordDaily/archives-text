### MISTY ESPINOZA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sunday night's sold-out Dispatch concert
in kresge Auditorium left me confounded. I
wasn't surprised at the talent displayed by
the three members of Dispatch. Nor was I
taken aback by their incredible ability to
mesmerize the crowd. My surprise came in
the crowd demographic. Surrounded by en
thusiastic, borderline fanatical high school
ers, I was given hope that todav's youth ac
tually enjov great musit tli.it isn't manufac
tured by M l V's " l otal Request Live."
Dispatch's sound is mi amazing fusion
of rock, reggae and Ituik that is complete-
Iv dillerent front the homogenous pop
sound of todav. I spent most of the night
sitting back and soaking in the scene ol
voting people dam ing and singing along
to great music.
brad (lorrigan, Pete I leimbold and (lhad
Urmston, collectively known as Dispatch,
hail from Boston and have a strong East
