# 'Startup.com': an interview with the Valley's dot-com documentarian
## 
### LAURA LEE 
In the midst of New York Silicon Alley's startup boom,
Jehane Noujaim began filming her roommate, Kaleil
Isa/.a Tuzinan, after lie founded the Internet company
(iovWorks.com with his longtime friend, loin Herman.
Noujaim filmed the trajectory of the company from its ini
tial funding from venture capitalists, through its growth
into a large, 200-plus-einployee company and until its
downfall 18 months later. I lie film, "Startup.com," lo
nises on the ( hanging relationship between Kaleil and
I mil, the two cheil executive ollicers ol the companv.
Noujaim teamed up with longtime dot umentary film
makers Chris llegedus and I).A. I'enncbakcr to create
"Startup.com," which opens tomorrow. I talked with
Noujaim last week about hei film and living the startup
lile through the lens ola camera.
How old are you now? I had read that you had left your
job at MTV at age 25.
I'm 2(>. I'm 27 in a week.
You had left your job at MTV to start your own film com
pany, Noujaim Films. Why did you do this? Did working
on "Startup.coin" prompt you to start your own film
company?
No — I was planning on starting the companv lor tax
reasons .iikl because I w.is getting a lot of requests loi
shooting projec is li just helps to have a name and a com
pam lli.it people can * all. I had saved up for about three
vears io make this othei film tli.it would be set in lg\ pi,
and I wanted this film to be undei the ( ompam name.
I he first ma jot project I< >i I he ( ompam was "Start up."
I had the whole budget to go back to l.g\ pi, and I was de
bating whether to return. I hen I realized that this storv
was going on light nuclei m\ nose because Kaleil was
planning on quitting Ins $:i()0,000 to $ 100,00(1-.i veai job
at Goldman Sac hs to si art this Internet compam. I le was
planning the conipam out ol out apartment, and I de
cided not to go back l ci I'.gvpt because what was going on
in Kgypt would be happening fora while, and this would
be happening vet v last
I he concept ol his Internet conipam was \er\ ievolu
tionary. It would allow c iti/ens to interact with local gov
ernments through a Web site. I he\ were going to pm
gover■iinient online. I he\ were going to c reate this town
hall online, li was ver\ anti-establishment.
You thought GovWorks.com was anti-establishment
or the idea of quitting an established corporate job
and starting a company with your own idea was anti
establishment?
I he lac t that you're going to quit your job — that
you're going to form a company with a bunch of friends
— is very anti-establisluneut. It's going to be a flat orga
nization. You're going to get all this money from these
very established [venture capitalists], but they're not
going to control you. I hat was the idea behind all of these
pitching sessions. II the VCs gave them money — they
wanted the money, but they didn't want to be controlled
by the \ (Is. I hey basically wanted to be their own bosses.
You thought that it wouldn't be hierarchical. Is that what
you mean by a flat organization?
Yes. They initially didn't want it to be a hierarchical or
ganization. Kaleil is Latin American, his partners were
Asian and African American, and loin is Jewish. They
had this very diverse company, and they were going to
move to Harlem to start an Internet community and to
create a government online and bridge the Internet rev
olution. So it wasn't barbecue.com.
Were you more interested in GovWorks.com in terms of
the business model and the business? You didn't show
that part in the movie.
I was interested in the kind ol people who would throw

their lives into making a revolutionary idea work. I was
more interested in the fact that it wasn't one of those ideas
to make money quick and cash out. Kaleil really wanted
the company to work. But that's not to say that it didn't
become that because all of a sudden they had $(>0 million
hanging on their shoulders and they had a lot of venture
capitalists breathing down their necks wondering why
they weren't making any profits.
How did you feel as the company progressed since you
say you were interested in the diversity and idealistic
concepts?
I wasn't interested in how you c reate an In

ternet company, but it was inspiring for me to
see all ol these people dropping out ol business
school and law school and great jobs because
the v wanted to be their own bosses. Tliev were
going to c liange the way that business and gov
ernment work. I hey were going to make money
and create something good tor humanitv.
I should answer the earliei question about
how I was interested more in the business be
cause that's not exactly true. I was Kaleil's
room mate, and business has alwa\ s fascinated
inc. My father's a businessman, and I've
watched him negotiate with people. I here is
just a lot that goes on behind the scenes of
business (hat has alwavs fascinated me be
cause it is very human.
I'm wondering why you chose that certain nar
rative structure to work with instead of having a
narrator or voiceover to explain things?
I was interested in making a film where von
feel totallv dropped into that world. I hat was a
question throughout the film because Kaleil is
in\ roommate. Kaleil was constanth talking to
me and relei l ing to me in all the footage that we
shot. It was a question as to whether I should be
acharac tei in the film. I lounci that, when I put
pieces of me in.it takes the viewer out of the
stor\ Ihe same thing happens with narration.
on feel like vou're being told something. And
you don t want to be told something. You want
to experience tli.it something. It takes a lot to
not use a narratoi or voic cover, but I think that
the end result is that the person who is watch ing
feels like they were dropped into this world.
I low much do you think the genre of reality TV
influenced the construction of the film?
I think that reality TV is very different. I
think that this kind of film is more like- writing a
book. I think reality TV is more like a game
show. Ihe only reason people are there is be
cause of the television show. The people in this
film were there to build a business. Whether we
could get in with our cameras or not, it didn't

make a difference to them. In reality TV, people are act
ing a game show. In this kind of film, people are living
their lives.
Did your work at MTV influence the style of film that
you made?
I did learn a lot from MTV about cutting down. It was
a painful experience to have to take people's lives and cut
them into stories. I would often have lo cut very compli
cated stories into five-minute segments. That gave me a
lot of training in terms of condensing. I shot 400 hours,
and I had to condense Kaleil and Tom's lives 112 rom a year
and a half to an hour and a half .
If the movie were longer, what else would you include?
1 would definitely include the downfall. We allude
to what happens to the company and to Kaleil, hut we
don't show the intensity of what he went through, but

1 filmed it. When he gets upset about something, he
goes and looks fora gym. It was about 10 o'clock at
night, and we spent about three hours driving around
looking fora gym and through this whole conversa
tion, he was talking about how he lost $(>() million. We
were having a conversation as friends. But when we
got back to my apartment, he said, "You know, if you
really need to turn on the camera . . ."
He knows th.it I have this split personality a lot of the
time where I was really not sure whether I should be film
ing or whether I should give him a hug. So when we got
back, he said, "If you want to turn on the camera for the

rest of our conversations, you can do that," and, with that
permission, I filmed a lot of footage of him just sitting on
our kitchen floor. When we were figuring out if we should
put it at the end of the film or not, it really ended up turn
ing into a tragedy. Once you see the whole ending of
Kaleil and I om s relationship, you're too tired to experi
ence another downfall.
In scenes like that, you would ask questions to prompt...
1 om and Kaleil? Yes. We definitely had conversations.
Kaleil and I were driving back and forth every day from
the office together. I would drive with him in the morn
ing to the office, and, when he wasn't on his cell phone,
we would have conversations about what was going on,
and the camera would be on my lap. 11 was great having a
camera with a flip-out screen. I could just have it on my
lap and not have it in front of my face while carrying on a
conversation.

You took 400 hours of footage. I read that your shooting
schedule included 18-hour days over a year. Could you
give me more information about your schedule? Would
you be with Kaleil and Tom over an 18-hour day, but
record only two hours of their day?
1 would get up in the morning and go into the of lice
with Kaleil, and I'd look at his schedule for the day be
cause it was constantly changing. He'd have meetings all
day. I would figure out which meetings I'd want to go
into. A few days in advance I'd make phone calls, and I
would get access to about 50 percent of them. Then I

would call Chris, who was my partner, and if she could
make it to the meetings, she'd come and film with me.
Generally, the smaller situations that randomly
happened, I would just film. I mean a lot of it is hang
ing out and waiting for things to happen. I'd hang out
at GovWorks. On the weekends, I'd hangout at home
and a lot would happen. At home, or at the gym, that
was where a lot of the more personal conversations
took place. It very much interested me that we talked
about whether Kaleil should continue living with me
through the filming.
We thought that we might go crazy basically living to
gether while I was shooting him all the time. We decided
that I would not be able to make a more interesting film
than making a film about someone who I was living with
all the time. I was able to get his girlfriends talking and the
behind the scenes stuff— the human story behind the In
ternet. You've read about the rise and tail of the dot-coms

in all of the papers, but you haven't really seen what's
happened personally to those people.
How did you feel through those 18 months? Did you feel
emotionally tied to the company?
1 was less emotionally tied to the company than to
Kaleil. I om and the guys that were running it because it
was really their whole lives that they put into the Gov-
Works. When you're following somebody all the time,
you're living vicariously through him or her. You really
want your guys to win.
I'd say that the saddest time that I've ever felt was
when I went back to the companv. I've

watched the whole thing grow, from the first
employee to 2.'*o, so I reallx just fell a part of it.
I'lie day that I went in, we had already started
editing. I went into the office to check out what
was going on. Once we had started editing in
July, I spent most ol the days editing.
I Ins was after loin left, and then I would
periodic ally go in and check out what was hap
pening with the- company. It was more difficult at
this point because there were more senior people
involved with the companv, I wasn't in there
every da\ and, because the companv was going
through more dillicult times, people were more
nervous about the c ameras, so I went in less. I re
member the saddest feeling walking around the
office .ind seeing those enipt\ desks. I hat's when
I took the shot of the empty desks. Many people
had lost their jobs. It was really a heart-wrench
ing experience.
How is it working with Chris Hegedus and I).A.
Pennebaker?
Well, the)'re wonderful people, as well
as wonderful filmmakers. I he support that the\
provided me was incredible. I'd made two short
films before, but I'd never made a film this long,
over such a long period of time. Yon c an get very
disillusioned when the story seems to be taking
all ol these different turns. You don't really know
if you're getting a story or not. So I'd be on (hi
pbone with them all the time.
I imes when Kaleil would be going to
('.alifornia at the last minute and I'd be c ailing all
ol my friends trying to get airline miles. I'd call
up (:ln is and be like, "What do I do, I don't have
enough airline miles to make it. Should I spend
the $600 to gel on this flight?" They would al
ways help me make these decisions.
And IVnne is one of those very lucky
people. I le has an innate sense of what's going
to happen. He said very early on in the film
ing, "Just stick to Kaleil." Very simple advice:
Stick to Kaleil, shoot until you get bored and
the interesting dynamic is going to be the dy
namic between Kaleil and Tom, which we felt

quite early on.
What did you think about the article in the New York
Times. There's a quote from Tom and Kaleil about how
you sacrificed realism in the interest of telling a good
story. What did you think about that?
I agree to a certain extent. Remember that we cut
out — and that was the most difficult thing about edit
ing this film together — 398 hours of footage. It was a
choice not to have people typing 011 the computer for
20 minutes. It was a choice not to have Tom talking
about why exactly the technology was going down,
about the pressures that Tom [who was in charge of
technology] had.
What was happening was that the business plan was
changing constantly, and they were getting all of this ad
vice from the outside. I hey were constantly changing the
business plan, and I 0111 had to keep up with it. I le built

an incredible technology that ended up being sold when
they sold the company.
On a personal side, Tom felt like he came across well,
but, from a business perspective, it was disappointing for
him because he always felt like the real story would be told
when the movie came out. We didn't want to make a
processed story. We wanted to appeal to a general audi
ence. And what makes this story interesting to a large
number of people is the problem that so many people
have — juggling friendship and business — and it's not
the details of how to build a technology.
You'll have the director's cut parts.
I'll have the director's cut. I'm going to make a special
movie for l oin and Ralcil. I went to college with Kaleil,
and he can be a fun and laid-back guy, but, when lie was
building this business, lie was under so much pressure
that (lov\\ orks was all he could concentrate on.
So I'm sure he looks at it now and he says, "My God,
how I treated my girlfriends and I c an't believe that I es
corted l oin out ol the building, but he did all of those
things because lie was under intense pressure from the
board and from the lawyers and a number of other peo
ple. I did feel like it was a part of the storv because it was
.1 part of what he went through.
I was wondering how Tom felt when he watehed that
part of the movie where Kaleil is telling the guard of the
building not to let any employees in without a badge,
and the part before that when Kaleil tells the other em
ployees not to let Tom back in the building.
loin had an inkling about it before because the next
morning he went in to get some ol his things and tlie\
wouldn't let him in.
But how did he feel watching that part of the movie?
At the time that he watched it, I think I oni felt quite
angry with Kaleil, and I think that it reinforced a lot of
the feelings that he felt. \i the end ol the film, Kaleil and
I ( >lll get back together and later they start another com
pany together, but it took them six months to work
through what the\ needed to work through and the be
trayal that both of them felt. I'm sure it was heart wrench
ing for them. Both of them got up and went to the bath
room. They watched it separately, but both of them got
up and took a bathroom break like five minutes after
watching it.
I'm wondering what your advice to young Stanford film
makers would be?
IV) go out and do it. I mean, the camera is a couple
thousand dollars and the tapes are 10 bucks apiece and,
if you have a good idea, just go out and really pursue it.
And it has to be something that you're passionate and ob
sessed about.
I read in an article that Chris was saying that you were
obsessed with startups and that's why she knew you'd do
a great job on the project.
It's because I was obsessed. It's not rocket science! I
knew how to shoot and how to frame things decently. The
rest of it is being there at the right time and trying to get
into as much as you can. It's not rocket science, and I was
incredibly lucky that I was Kaleil's roommate, and that
Kaleil was very excited about the film.
lie's a very visionary person. At the beginning, he
thought that it could be used as a good tool for business
schools. On top of that, I was incredibly lucky to partner
with Chris and I'enne because they are wonderful.
For aspiring filmmakers, I'd say that it is wonderful to
be able to work with people who have gone through the
experience numerous times. A lot of it is encouragement
from them. Like, I would go and flop on their couch and
say, "I've missed the most important thing," and Chris
and I'enne would say, "Don't worry about it — it'll hap
pen again."
