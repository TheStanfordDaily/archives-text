Noujaim and I legedus followed
I 0111 and Kaleil ever\ w liei e — < >11
business trips, into the (lovworks
ollice building, into the g\ 111 and
into Kaleil and I oin's homes. Nou
jaim, who was Kaleils roomate,
com eived ol the idea to make .1

documentary .it >< >i n the dot-coin
startup as she watched Kaleil —
who had only .1 conception ola
business — raise thousands of dol
lars Ironi private investors from Ins
room. As his close friend and
roommate, Noujaim was privy to
many personal convers.it ions and
on the scene to record critical
events.
I he skeleton ol the story is what
is happening to (iovworks, and.
thcrelore, the business and tec Imi
cal side ol the dot-coin are not
lleshed out Instead, the film has .1
realit\ I N feel. li s about the emo
tions Ih.lt go hand in hand with
working in a high-pressure envi

ronment. There is some, but littk*
context about why the business is
failing. I lie film does not lend new
insight to the phenomenon of star
tups or explain why certain com
panies failed or prospered. Ii ne
jjlec is the hard questions about the
ciliics ol the New Kconoiny, wh\
there was a bubble and why a
bum Ii ol young people with prac
tically no business plans were given
s<» muc Ii monev Instead, the audi
ence follows the two c hief execu
tive of lie crs through a rollei coast
er ol emotions as the company re
neves millions of venture capital
and then struggles to define a
produc 1 and a company.

Like audiences of "Survivor,"
viewers of this movie already know
an outline of a plot. Startups were
doing well in I'.MM), but the bubble
burst in 20(H) and the NASDAQ
plunged, i"lie audience wants to
see how (iovworks.com fares.
The focus of "Startup.com" is
more a reflection of Americans
fast ination with watching real peo
ple's emotions in high pressure sit
uations than with the actual phe
nomenon! ol dot-coms. I he movie
is dramatic and the tense atmos
phere is sometimes tlillusetl with
hits ol humor.
