# Ramin's Reel Deal
## Summer blockbusters come up bust

Last year at this time, "(lladia

with stalwart special effects and
playful performances. Although

the movie certainh didn't deserve

Awards, n delivered .1 c heap thrill:
It was Inn, frisky entertainment.

" The Mummy Returns" take the
No. I spot at the box office two
weeks in a row. And it doesn't look
like Jennifer Lopez and "Angel

Kyes," which opens tomorrow, is
going to make a dent in the mind
less run ol " I lie Mummy."
So, until "Pearl Harbor" opens
on Mav 25, take my advice: Skip
the visit to the multi-plex and head
to the local video store instead.
With all the hnz/ about summer at

"Pay it Forward." Helen Hunt
stars as a single mom who takes
care of her son (Haley Joel ()s
-nicnt) and falls in love with his
teacher (Kevin Spacey). I he

staggering subplots and the end

surpasses any on-screen presence
I've seen .ill year. The movie
doesn't entirely work, hut it's
worth the rental price. Spacey and

"Miss (iongeniality." 1 his one is
