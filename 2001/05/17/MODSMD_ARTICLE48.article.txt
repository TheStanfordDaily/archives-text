# Love me, love my ogre: 'Shrek' gives fairy tales a goose
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's amazing how last technology is
moving in the computer animation world.
At tin' end ol this coming summer, you will
get the chance to see the movie "Final Fan
tasy," which has human characters looking
so lifelike t hat it's kind of scary. I personal
ly will not be looking forward to its release
because I don't want my favorite actors to
ever be replaced by computers. If "Final
Fantasy" is a hit, a move toward that end
may be escalated into hard reality.
But let's backtrack a little. Tomorrow,
yon will get a chance to see the computer
animated comedy "Shrek." which I think
gets everything just about right. As (effrey
katzenberg, the "K" in "Dreamworks
Sk(and one ol the producers of the film
points out, " 'Shrek' is far and above any
thing that's been done in computer ani
mation . . . for at least 10 seconds. Yes, it's
st.ite of the art, but do I think it will be .1
bene lnnark fora long time to come? No. It
w ill be the benchmark for .1 day or two."
I he animation is very advanced and in
teresting, but no one in "Shrek" looks
completely human, thank goodness. And
katzenberg knows that its technological
u i/ardry will be eclipsed by the end of this
summer anyway. But I will be shocked il
the filmmakers of'T'inal Fantasy" give us a
.is well-rounded, demographic — tran
scending, wonderfully enjoyable creation
of .111 animated film, no matter how cool
they think they are.
Yes. it's true. I loved "Shrek." (I'm not
the only one; it is receiving praise .it
Cannes as I write this, being the first ani
mated film to enter competition at the fes
ii\.il in .'lO years). I walked into this film
skeptical, in a bad mood, with cold pop
corn. and. despite my best efforts, it won
me over. Why? The answer is actually ver\
simple. I think it's horrible when tec hnol
og\ is used as a substitute for good writing,
an interesting storyline and good acting.
I his applies, of course, not on K to animat
ed films, but to action films as well. (You
hear that, Michael bay? Stop with the
damn explosions!)
Now I love to be technologically da/zled
.is much as the next guy, but if there's no
substance behind it. then screw it. Once
again, "Shrek" gets it all right — combin

ing excellent voice talent, smart writing
and state ol the art animation into a story
that works on so many levels that it will
leave few people uninterested.
The story is deceptively simple on the
surface, with .1 plot straightforward
enough that eight-year-old kids will still
get it: An antisocial ogre, Shrek (Mike
Myers), agrees to go on a quest for

the evil Lord Farquaad

(John

I.ithgow) .iikl bring back Princess Fiona
(Cameron Diaz). II he is successful, Far
(juaad will remove all of the sot ietal out< .ists
that he has relo< atecl to Shrek's swamp.
Shrek is accompanied on his travels,
much to his dismay, by Donkey (Fddie
Murphv). Alter the rescue, Princess Fiona
starts to slowly I.ill in love with Shrek, hut
Shrek thinks that no one would ever love
him. Fvervthing resolves itsrll in the das
sit moral argument: Finhrace who you
trul\ are il you want to line! real happiness.
Sound like a run-of-the-mill kiddy flick
in the spirit ol "I lenities," "Pocahontas"
or whatever animated crap mv three little
cousins will he watching next week? Well,
let's throw in some of the twists.
1 wist No. I: "Shrek" is a (airy tale, in
the most literal sense. Not only are the
leading characters verv

fairy tale-like — for in
stant e, Fiona is .1 print ess
locked in .1 tower guard
ed by a dragon, waiting
for her true love to res
cue her — but the\ live in
a world populated In jiisi
about every familiar fairy
tale character you can
think of. I'innochio, the
Ihree Blind Mice, the
Ihree Bears, the (■ inger
bread Man, even the
Magic Mirror — they're
all there. It is all these
poor fairy tale characters
that are relocated by
Lord Farquaad to
Shrek's swamp because
Farquaad wants his king
dom to be humans only.
I w isi \o 2: I he

(ilin lakes some inspiration from Twist No.
1 and decides to turn |ust about every fairy
tale convention it can directly 011 its head.
Director Andrew Adamson said at a press
conference at Cannes that "we wanted to
demystih the stereotypes which fairy tales
reinforce." As Katzenberg savs, " 'Shrek'
kind
of looks backward at all the fairy tale

traditions we grew up on

and (.ikes great fun

turning all those storytelling conventions
upside-down and inside-out."
A great example ol this comes after the
rescue scene. Fiona begs Shrek to take oil
his helmet and kiss her because she thinks
I. . . I I I I II

lie must In- her one true love, and, well,
that's just how fairy tales go. When he
finally does take his helmet »>ll, Fiona is
shocked. In addition, Shrek refuses to
kiss her. prompting her to shout, "You
are supposed to he my one true love!
I his isn't how it works!" (Does she tut n
out to be corret t in the end? Well, we'll
have to see.)
Another extremely ballsy example:
I n one scene, .1 bird settles down into
.1 tree next to Fiona and starts to sing.
She sings back in return, and they
enter into a duet. Just when we think
that there is a horrible saccharine

song coming up. Fiona tries to go up
to some high notes and screc< lies tlietn so
badlv that the bird explodes. I lie lac t Ill.lt
t Ins scene can be played for laughs is gutsv.
I lie l.u t that it ,K tuallv works is even more
ama/ing.
I wist No. 3: Flie script, written by Fed
Flliott .ind Ferry Kossio ("The Mask ol
Zorro," "Aladdin" and "Ant/"), contains
enough double entendres to keep am
.i(11 1 It (or college student) just .is happy as
the kids sitting next to them. !• xatuples: As
Lord Farquaad tortures the (iingcrhread
Man 101 information, pulling Ins leg and
his buttons off. the (iingerbread Man yells
"FAT MFH!" ((.et it, kids? He's a Ginger
bread Man and he said, "Fat me!" I la, ha!)
()r, when in an ambiguous exchange of di
alogue relating to the whole kissing thing
between Shrek, Fiona and Donkey. Shrek
makes a comment to Fiona about "Kissing
my ass." (Get it, kids? He's saying ... okay,

I guess that one's not even hidden to six
year-old kids) I he specific jokes aside, it's
even just funnv to see kids and adults
laughing at the same lines for completely
different reasons.
in addition to the multi-layered storv,
there are obviously some other ingredi
ents that help make this film wonderful.
Fhe c ast is. of course, extremely talented.
Mike Myers, who signed on to replace the
late Chris Farley, gives Shrek a light Scot
tish accent and a lot of grouchy charac let
(Think Fat Bastard toned down a little.)
Eddie Murphy is in a very similar mode to
Mushu, Ins character in "Mulan," onl\
funnier. Diaz and Lithgow are solid.
There is also a good close of anac luo
nistic modern music, just like "A Knight's
rale" released last week, but here it does
not seem to get in the way and is more
veiled i.e. fewer songs that you recognize,
although Smashmouth's "Allstar" does
sneak in there fora great effect.
I he animation is. I somewhat grudg
ingh say. ven appealing. It is truly state of
the art, and I onl\ wish that the"state of
the art" would sta\ in "Shrek" s general
ballpark. Sure, there could be some little
improvements here and there, but ulti
match I don't waul animated c haracters to
look an\ more real! I lere, the attention to
detail is dazzling, as every shot of our he
roes was animated in a four-layer proce
dure that sii ives to make their movements
look as authentic as possible. Most impres
sive are the facial expressions that Shrek
makes when lie- is hiding what he is realb
feeling b\ saying one thing but thinking
something else. I lu- scenes in the dragon's
castle, espeiially the dragon's lire breath
ing, are very impressive as well.
In addition to all these ingredients.

then* is something else that makes this
movie (eel fresh and on the edge. I don't
quite know what it is Mayhe it's the fact
that it's a Dreamworks film, and that the
yonng studio has prided iiself on taking
< hand's over il s first seven years of exis
tenee. Mayhe it's the fact that this is the
first film for both directors, Andrew
Adamson and Vic k\ |enson. I hey don't
know am better than to be bold. It
works. If only more American animated
films could be made this way. Put it .ill to
gether. and you have a film that rarely
misses. Let's see if "Final Fantasy" can
hold up to th.tt.

/miatlian Heard admits that he is pri'judging
"Final Fantasy." 11 r just has serious preconceived
douhts. // it turns ouJ to be good, he xoill eat some
o] his woids. Bid if it stinks, he unll onh laugh.
