# 'La Boheme' a heart-wrenching tale: Bravo!
## 
### CAROLINE SAKAMOTO STAFF WRITER 
You s.iv you didn'i know yc»ii
could see real opera in San Jose?
Well, now you have no ex( use.
It was a pleasure to return to
Opera San | <»st* a year after my
first visit and see that the compa
ny is still doing solid work. Its
performance of "La Boheme," a
wise choice given the popularity
ol this opera, was a winnci.
The story of "La Boheme" —a
glimpse into the li\cs of free-lov
ing hohemiau men and women
— will sound familiar to those
who have seen the musical
"Rent." lour starving artists
share a sliahhv apai tinent 111 Paris
and joke about the money they
will have one day.
Minn, .1 seamstress who em
broiders flowers but loves real
ones, shows up at the door In
chance, and Rodolfo, a writer, is
immcdiatch taken with her. As
Minii and Rodollb's love grows.

Man ello, a painter, is tormented
by the tome-ons of lus heart
breaker ex-girlfriend, Musetta.
Rodolfo and Mimi move in to
gether. (The librettists intended
this part to be scandalous to the
extreme, but it's pretty nnu h lost
on anyone who lived through or
after the T>()s).
Soon, though, Mimi's tuber
culosis conies between them,
and they contemplate separat
ing, while Musetta and Marcel
lo argue. Back at the apart
ment, it's a bachelor pad all
over again, until Musetta brings
tlu* dying Mimi back and the
couples realize the pettiness ol
their arguments.
I hoin.is 11 uliitte was wonder
ful as Don |ose in Opera San
|ose's "(.arinen," and lus distinc
tive, sweet tenor defined his role
as Rodolfo. His at ting warmed
up through the t ourse of the per
lormaiice, as he went from slight
ly still s« encs to a heartl'eit final
profession ol love lor Mimi.

lruhitte, unfortunately, has
completed Ins tenure as artist-in
residence at ()pera San Jose, and
his voice will be sorely missed.
As Mimi, I leather (ialvete has
a voice noteable not for its beau
ty, but for its power and expres
sion — for its ability to cut across
Mimi's sickness, Rodolfo's jerk
like behavior and everything else
to get to the heart of the matter.
Her scenes of sorrow, especially
her death scene, could easily have
been trite, but Calvete is a strong
actress and, after her delicate
treatment ol the final notes and
gestures, there were few dry eyes
in the house.
I he striking Krina Newkirk
was perfect as Musetta. The audi
ence fell in love with her crystal
clear soprano voice and her flir
tatious, teasing style. She made
up admirably lot the lact that
Musetta's part is just a diversion
in the libretto, with no real piv
otal role. Scott Bearden's Marcel
lo was lots of fun as well, convey

ing the frustration ol loving a flirt
like Musetta.
This opera has quite a few
recitatives, which tends to make
things drag. But, luckily, they are
complemented by intriguing
duet pairings. Best of all, though,
was a four-part gem featuring
Rodolfo, Mimi, Marcello and
Musetta. Not only did they all
sound great together, they man
aged to do so while the first cou
ple was singing- romantically
about their first meeting and the
latter was hurling insults.
My favorite moment involved
baritone Jaco Venter. His charac
ter, Schaunard, sells his coat to
pay for Mimi's medicine, but he
can't do so without telling said
coat how much it means to him.
Venter sang a wonderlul, ridicu
lous, outrageous dirge fora win
ter coat, his voice as pure and
beautiful as could be as he sere
naded the coat (in Italian, no
less). The drawn-out "Orazie,
grazic" was too much to handle

with .i semi-straight face.
Peter Crompton's sets were
truly astounding. Ihe Mont
gomery Theater has an extreme
ly small stage, and I couldn't help
picturing how great the opera
would look on the ample stage of
the Center for the Performing
Arts not two blocks away. But
every single scene, from the
merry city street to the exterior
of Marcello's apartment, fea
tured colorful, three-dimension
al, realistic sets that expanded
the world of "La Boheme" signif
icantly. At least once, the stage
hands simply had to (lip the in
geniously constructed set pieces
to reveal.»totally different scene.
The story of "La Boheme"
might not be the most believable
or logical in the world, hut the
collected efforts of this opera
company made it into something
special.

lormaiice, as he went from slight
ly still s« encs to a heartl'eit final
profession ol love lor Mimi.

lruhitte, unfortunately, has
completed Ins tenure as artist-in
residence at ()pera San Jose, and
his voice will be sorely missed.
As Mimi, I leather (ialvete has
a voice noteable not for its beau
ty, but for its power and expres
sion — for its ability to cut across
Mimi's sickness, Rodolfo's jerk
like behavior and everything else
to get to the heart of the matter.
Her scenes of sorrow, especially
her death scene, could easily have
been trite, but Calvete is a strong
actress and, after her delicate
treatment ol the final notes and
gestures, there were few dry eyes
in the house.
I he striking Krina Newkirk
was perfect as Musetta. The audi
ence fell in love with her crystal
clear soprano voice and her flir
tatious, teasing style. She made
up admirably lot the lact that
Musetta's part is just a diversion
in the libretto, with no real piv
otal role. Scott Bearden's Marcel
lo was lots of fun as well, convey

ing the frustration ol loving a flirt
like Musetta.
This opera has quite a few
recitatives, which tends to make
things drag. But, luckily, they are
complemented by intriguing
duet pairings. Best of all, though,
was a four-part gem featuring
Rodolfo, Mimi, Marcello and
Musetta. Not only did they all
sound great together, they man
aged to do so while the first cou
ple was singing- romantically
about their first meeting and the
latter was hurling insults.
My favorite moment involved
baritone Jaco Venter. His charac
ter, Schaunard, sells his coat to
pay for Mimi's medicine, but he
can't do so without telling said
coat how much it means to him.
Venter sang a wonderlul, ridicu
lous, outrageous dirge fora win
ter coat, his voice as pure and
beautiful as could be as he sere
naded the coat (in Italian, no
less). The drawn-out "Orazie,
grazic" was too much to handle

with .i semi-straight face.
Peter Crompton's sets were
truly astounding. Ihe Mont
gomery Theater has an extreme
ly small stage, and I couldn't help
picturing how great the opera
would look on the ample stage of
the Center for the Performing
Arts not two blocks away. But
every single scene, from the
merry city street to the exterior
of Marcello's apartment, fea
tured colorful, three-dimension
al, realistic sets that expanded
the world of "La Boheme" signif
icantly. At least once, the stage
hands simply had to (lip the in
geniously constructed set pieces
to reveal.»totally different scene.
The story of "La Boheme"
might not be the most believable
or logical in the world, hut the
collected efforts of this opera
company made it into something
special.
