joined In the (>ai denei s.
In"The I Wo Sexes Observe
Kach Other," the couples engage
in a fun game ol musical (hairs.
I be women are dressed as men in
Renaissance-era attire, which
seems to be a justifu ation for their
aggressiveness at musical chairs.
I hen, a lot ol ideas are blitzed to

the audieiu e at once.
I he odd man out in the game ol
musical chairs is meant to be the
person searching to be part ol the
in-i row (I < >1 couples. I le pushes an
other man out of a (hail, onlv to be
pushed out himself. Men slither
along the flooi to a regalh poised
woman who brushes oil their
courtship while she stn>lls around,
looking at all her male prospects.
But although the sequence is en
tertaining, if the viewer is analyz
ing constantly, it becomes repeti
tive and.in fact, doesn't feature
mu( b beaulN in the wav ol dance.
Its somewhat difficult to accept
running around a stage as dance
steps. espe( ially w hen the runnel s
are ballerinas instead of I wyla
I harp's people.
1 lie "(iardeners," however,
were like an oasis. I he\ exhibited
athleticism and grace while mak
ing the jerky choreograph\ inter
esting. Ibis was full-out modern

dance, yet it w.isn't .is inscrutable as
modern dance. As they hopped
Ibrward, then hopped backward,
their bodies tilled at uncoinlbrt
able angles. the\ were telling the
ston of the tentative steps that fu
ture couples take, ol the fear ol
mist.ikes and of being hurt.
Ihe sets lor "Le Pare" were
harsh and modern and were the
first due that the Paris ()pera Bal
let wasn't going to perform a ro
mantic "Swan Lake"-esijue fant.i
s\ Ihe company helped loconve\
the idea that love is a dangerous
minefield, that every corner is
foreboding.
Ii took gobs of time, money and
elloi i to bring the Paris ()pera Hal
let to \merica. Let's hope that the
next time the dancers come, thc\
choose work thai will blossom on
an American stage.


Hoop skirts are so cumbersome for dancing
