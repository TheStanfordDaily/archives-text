Answer: Dear Booty School Drop-out, \ $3
Well, here at Stanford, "hookup" means different things to different people. So, for your eqgjkatton, here is a legend to the true campus map — oflooove. (Get out of here,
Barry White — I'll call yon when I need you.)
Let s start with the tamest of our randy brethren — Serra. In Serra, hookups involve sweaty, intertwined flesh with mutual caressing of the erogenous zones of the upper ex
tremities. In Victorian circles, this is known as hand-holding. ' J
Occasionally, a Serrite is drawn into the darker acts of lust by a chance encounter with someone from J&an/anita, where kissing is known to take place with some frequency.
(lastano has recently earned a precocious reputation by introducing the "tongue kiss" to its repertoire. It has yet to catch on in Kimball or Lantana because residents deem this
particular activity yucky and view the whole "exchange of fluids" thing as a murky sea best negated by the H Vn«j<Jern day Magellan, if you will.
Sliding up Escondido Road like a silken-clad thigh, we come to all-frosh Branner — home of the drunken The drunken hookup is defined by the moment of abject
terror a guy experiences upon waking up next to a face-down, lithe body with a short haircut. No matter how transient this moment, the horror is enough to make one think
twice about doing that 12th Jell-O shot at the next Screw Your Roommate affair.
I oyon is home to ghosts of hookups past. This is where all the random hookups from freshman year have defaulted into relationships because participants heedlessly plowed
through the crucial third-encounter-Rubicon. A random hookup with seconds remains a hookup, but, by third*, |t>u probably know his or her last name. You have transitioned
into quasi-relationship status. Some of these relationships limp into junior year, and, when this happens, jyoli become the proud owner of a default wife. Game over. Welcome
to the next 30 years with your random hookup.
Often, people are confused by the various definitions of "hookup" in the co-ops. They all mean roughlv thing: hot hippie-on-hippie action. But there are subtle dif
ferences in hippie-hippie hookups. However, these can usually only be determined after the facfc Question: Do 1 smell like hummus? Answer: I have hooked up at Synergy.
Question: Do 1 smell like feta? Answer: Ah, dairy products. Must be Columbae. If your memory of the experience includes a touching moment with a pan-dimensional thetan,
it was definitely Enchanted Broccoli Forest and it's time to get your ass to detox, "toute suite."
Moving along to the bawdy stylings of the Band Shak, band members are. of course, known for their devil-may-care attitude. But this reputation does not necessarily include
sexual exploits. I his reporter has learned that, at a recent Shak party, the term "hooking up" wis applied, albeit loosely, to an activity that involved three geeks, the Tree and
a tuba.
At Roble, the gold standard for hooking up begins with a marathon spooning session that into "outercourse" (also known as dry humping). If you have the pa
tience to see this interaction through until the wee daylight hours, it can develop into actual sex and yon nave successfully parlayed spooning into "sporking." Well done.
