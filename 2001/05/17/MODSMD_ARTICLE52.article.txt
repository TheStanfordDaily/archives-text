I wo years ago, French word-01-inouth sent us from one fine bistro i<» another. I lie journey happily ended .it Bistro !• lan,
whi< li serves what we consider to he the hest Freru h cuisine in the area. We were tools to take so long in gelling there, .is this
gem ola bistro had been under our noses all along.
Buried under a bed of ivy and nestled between a natural foods market and an inauspk ions building, one could spend lour
vears driving by Bistro Man en route to Antonio's Nuthouse or Printer's ('.ale on (lalifoi nia Avenue in Palo Alto without ever
setting foot inside Klan'swarm interior.

getary com cms arc second to gastronomic ones. Bistro Klan can be expensive, especially if you plan on t.iking advant.ige of
I heir extensive Freiu h wine list.
Uncharacteristk ally on time, the two of us settled down at our table and began what would prove to be a long wait lor our
dining companions. Fortunately, the sling of the wait was (lulled as we indulged in wheaty bliss via delectable bread that con-

tained walnuts inside. When we finished the bread, we initiated small talk with our demure French waitress. Smiled to the gills with bread and with not a drop in our bladders, we wel
comed our three tardy friends to the table, "enlin," and immediateh ordered the cheapest bottle ol red wine we < ould find ($2O).
r«» start, our table gorged on a plethora of pea pant .ikes of the Knglish variety. Also consumed were pan-seared sea s( allops with < itrus and .1 mache and radish salad, as well as a mixed
green salatl with herbs. Although the pea pancakes may sound weird, we found them to be divine: perfet t buttery mush, enshrouded in the glorious shrubbery of the pea sprout. Mean
while, the shrubless scallops also cut the mustard with their delish citrus jus.
In retrospect, we should have also partaken in the seared alii tuna (with asparagus, lentils and caramelized onions), as well as the sauteed Sonoma Ibie gi as (on briot he with oranges,
arugula and hazelnut oil). Although we made the mistake ol forsaking the Ibie, it should not be missed, as it melts on the tongue most sensuously.
I he entrees arrived accompanied by what we believe to have been our third bottle of the aforementioned (heap red. (Note: It has a name that escapes the mind — your request lor
the ( heap red may not be well received). In what must have been .1 moment ol independent thinking, we all managed to order dillerent main courses: steak, sturgeon, salmon, thick and
<i medley of fine fish, fowl and beef
Particularly noteworthy was the sturgeon, det orated with at ugala and radicchio salatl. prosciutto, olive oil, lemon and mint. I he poached wild salmon swathed in warm potato salatl
with spinach and baton impressed us with .111 appropriately viscous attack 011 the taste buds.
In an effort to reach maximum density, we did not hesitate to viscously unbutton our pant buttons and order three hefty deserts. We had a strawberry and pistachio tart, hazelnut
(repe with caramelized bananas and milk chocolate praline saute. and .1 caramel pot du (renie accompanied by bistro cookies. I hey all rocked us, and the crepe left us incapacitated by
its dizzying flavah.
()ur bill was mighty, but deservedly so. These people sure can cook. Next time you are looking for something truly culinary, make your way to Bistro Klan.
