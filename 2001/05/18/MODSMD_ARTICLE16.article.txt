As the coordiuatoi of the IMI- 's latest

" I he conclusion we have drawn from

since these relativelx cheap sources xvill

"Financially, elec tiic utility companies

motivation to refrain from using electric

Although the price of energy will be
increasing, according to the study, this
situation should ultimatelv lead to a more
accurate reflection of the costs to utility
companies, encouraging consumers to
become more economical in their elec
