### aBy MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
l he Faculty Senate — in a rare divided
vote — increased the undergraduate writ
ing requirement at its meeting vesterd.n.
Under the proposal, Al' credit will no
longer satisfy one of the two required writ
ing courses. Beginning in the fall of2OOS .ill
entering freshmen w ill be required to t.ike
two writing courses at Stanford. 1 he second
writing course ma\ be taken In students in
their freshman or sophomore year, oi pos
sibly even later. ludei the proposal, the
Writing in the Majoi requirement will re
main substantially unaffected.

"We arc proposing .in enhanced writing
program. We're enhancing it
academicalh—it will he an incremental
program so that students see the impor
tance of writing as a developmental
process," Knglish and Linguistics I'rof. Fli/-
abctli I rangott s.iid. " I he classes will give
attention to both written and oral presenta
tion."
Main facult\ heralded this move as a
necessan means to remech poor student
v\ riting.
"I've been surprised In how mam Stan
ford students don't write well." Asstx . I'lu
losopln I'rof. DehraS.it/said.
Sat/ also voiced support for innovative

courses th.it could both improve student
writing and til into this modified program.
"I've also been surprised In how mam
students write well but don't have an argu
ment. I'd like tosee logit as one of the things
that counts towards the requirement. We
have a lot <>! students who are smooth but
can't give a justification for what the\ be
lieve. Math .md logu can do a lot t<> fin thei
a student s argument," she said.
However, la< ultv support was not unani
mous. Some fa< uli\ membei s said that the\
objected to increasing c ourse requirements.

"I don't doubt this is important. None of
the individual requirements is unimpor

everything and nothing else.' to use the
phrase. I'm going to vote against this. I'm
hoping that people will reinembei that stu

And some facultx remained uncon
