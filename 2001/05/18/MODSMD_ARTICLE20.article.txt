Stanford I ndergradu.ite Psycholog\
Conference, lie sa\s that the conference
was his "braiiK liild."
After visiting othei undergraduate
conferences in Santa ( lat a, San Jose and
I CIA Slavic li said he felt "frustrated"
because "the\ had very circumscribed
goals." It was then that he came up with
the idea of founding Stanford's own un

dergraduate psychology conference. "I
decided thai St.in ford could put 011 some
thing th.it \\. 1 s 11 iI» qualitxSlavic li said.
"When I began planning this event
back 111 Vla\ of 2000, the goal was to get .11
least 30 people to attend, li seems that we
have blown the dooi s off of that estimate.
()f the '220 registered attendees. 7!i arc
presenters and I 17 ate spec tatol v I wen
tv-seven sc liools are icprcscnied, .is well
as six states and four counti ies," Slavic li
said.
I he c onfcrcrwe will allow unclergrad
uate students to present I licit research
projee ts. Most students will be picsenting
then honors theses. Students can eithei
present orally, giving I f-minute talks fol
lowed by a a-minutc question-and-an
swet session in seminal si/.e looms. 01
they can present their research through
poster presentations, which Sla\i<li clc
sc ribes as "a s< ience fait set up 111 w hie h

voti summarize your thesis on <i large
poster.' I Ins option, Slavich said, "gives
|stll<U-iiis| ,i (liame to interact with more
people.
111nioi Adrian Agnilera will he pre
senting his research at the conference.
I lis paper is entitled "The Kffect of lo
kenism on the Possible Selves of Stigma
tized Incii\ iduals." Agnilera said that lie
sees tin - < onlerence as a "reward for peo
ple that have been doing research."
"People that do research usually do it
.ind thru stop at that. I hev usualh pre
sent to .1 sin.ill group, but litis < onleretKe
will rcalh help to get yout sttiH out there"
said Agnilera.
\< cording to the I ndet graduate Psy
chology Conference Web site, "in addi
tion to gi\ing, and hearing, traditional
papet .ind poslet presentations, p.it ti( i
pauts will meet in a small gn >up lot liiik Ii
with a Stanford professoi ot graduate

student who is ( intently performing re
search in the students' area of interest."
" I he conferciK e will be more of an op
portunitv to introduce undergraduates
to faculty members," Slavich said. "Most
schools don't have big names, so it is a big
deal for them to talk to some ol the su
pet slats in psychology. We are lucky to
have a well-known psychology depart
ment bete."
Slavich added ih.it although p.nt ol
the conlerence is about making connec
i ions, the other pai I of it is about "making
ps\( liology come alive."
In addition to undergraduates the
(on let etu c will also bring in high s( hool

tion." according to the ( ndcrgraduatc
