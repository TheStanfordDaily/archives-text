< haute 10 1 <■( (>lll it*< 1 will) .1 place that pi o\ it led
mam ol out loudest Stanford memories, to
meet a new generation ol I )ailv staffers and to
return to a university we nevet seem to get
enough 01.
Because we have It wet connexions to the
I'niversitv, we aie more reliant on Stanford
magazine lot comprehensive coverage ol
campus news .uid events. 11 adit tonally the
magazine was a grand journalistic endeavor
— it had hard hitting stories and Hist -class
writing m an attractive package. Sadly, in the
last eight months, we have seen the maga/ine
transfot m into a shadow ol its former self.
I hough we have hugely leli the journalism
profession, we are not so detached that we do

not recognize that Stanford has become little
more than a public relations tool.
Most stliking in this transformation is the
magazine's loss ol its journalistic edge. The
January / I ebruary cover story on land use is
a case in point. We expected Stanford to pro
din e the definitive story: < ritically examining
both positions with analytic rigor. What we re
< eived instead was a stor\ th.it did little more
than rehash the spin that Stanford and its op
position led to other media outlets.
It also seems that there are lewer stories
about the concerns of current students and
faculty and more stories lonised on isolated
phenomena. The space 1 cscrvcd lor a story in
the November / Decetnbei issue on a Stan
lord graduate who served as an egg donor
could have profiled a da\ in the lile ol the
I reslunan-Sophoniore College or communi
t\ service initiatives in Kast I'aloAlto.

Those stories we are getting aren't told
with the clarity and grace we've come to ex
pect from Stanford. A year ago a majority ol
the magazine s articles were written b\ some
of the wot Id's finest writers, among them
Pulitzet l'i i/e winners and seasoned profes
sional journalists. More recent contributors,
though, seem to be pulled largely from .1 pool
ol less experienced l'>av Area Ireelant et s. And
the material produced by this greener group
lacks the polish of old: the language is less so
phisticated, more wordy, and doesn't roll of
the tongue, lo wit, nothing we've seen in the
past lour issues has merited reading aloud
over the breakfast table.
In the coming months, we'd like to see the
magazine take a critical look at the impact of
the dot-com ( ollapse on alumni giving and the
endowment. I here is perhaps no other uni
versitv in the I nited States more closely tied

with flic New Hconomy, and we'd like a thor
ough piece oil where Stanford's money is
coming from. Now that we are almost a year
into President I lennessy's tenure, we'd also
like a meaty assessment of 11 it* state of the hu
manities .it Stanford. And we'd like something
other than a celebratory piece about the re
cent grant from the I feu lett Foundation, per
haps a behind-the-scenes looks at how it was
won or a balance sheet look at where it will go.
Possibly the poor state of the magazine can
be attributed in part to the economic slow
down and de< lining ad sales that have forced
all publications to more closely watch their
bottom lines. Or perhaps the current staff
may not be as well con nee led with a cadre of
world class writers. Or perhaps, just maybe,
this is the inevitable outcome of the Universi
ty's takeovci of the maga/ine s publisher, the
Stanford Alumni Association.
