Stanford should do all it can
to increase alumni giving
Stanford is doing something long ovei -
due. \ on should check out Vales video,
which features students giggling and
romping in a snow hall light in New
I laven — all whilealoui li football game in
the snow is happening Ixhind them. I'm
not trying to support the idea of falsi!\ii»g
student life, hut I dolx'licve that Stanford is
still exploring new ways of keeping alumni
in toiu h.
f'lie fact of the mailer is that Stanford
does lag In-hind certain peel institutions in
alumni giving. Not in toial amounts —
Stanford is alwa\s at or neat the lop lor an
nual giving. But for percent giving from
alumni, Stanford has seen its numfxTs rise
from more than .SO|XTccnt to-40 percent as
recently as this past fundiaising year. And
tfie University should Ix- very proud of this
substantial increase in alumni involvement
and participation.
hut considering the fad ifiat Stanford
doesn't even do alumni interviewing and
hasn't made the "epi< film for alumni" lx
fore, Stanford does exceptional work lot
keeping alumni 111 tone hand getting them
to give money to their alma mater. Before
jumping to conclusions about why alumni
are not "overly excited," maylx* we should
see what more we can do lot alumni in
volvement. 1 lie recent announcement of
the distance alliance and President John
Hennessv's national tout seem to lx- great
ways of keeping the momentum in alumni
giving going. I, for one, would like t»> see
alumni interviewing as another added re
sponsibility and privilege to look forward to
after graduating from here.

We are the future alumni. We should
voice how we want it) sia\ in lout Ii with om
alma mater.

Film hiqhlighrs the problem
of glamor at Stanford
I lie Daih's editorial vesterda\ ("Movie
to prolix>te alumni giving misses the mark")
did gi.ib 1 1 it* bull by the horns: Alumni
money appears to l>e more precious than
alumni intelligence, lot example, we were
(ailed to fill I he Main Quad so that the film
< lew could get some Kreiiilin-inteiisit\ pro
paganda shots.
But we have to aim at the bull's eye,
namely glamor. Anything thai leads to the
idea of Stanford Ix-ing "a univeisit\ more
than a university" is glamor. Sure, glamor
keeps the coffins heavy, but it does so at a
huge long-term cost: I he s(k ial mutation < >1
the I niversin from an independent leader
to the speai head of Ameii< an elites, lx- the\
real or imaginary.
As grateful as I am to those alumni who
suppott m\ studies at Stanford, I cannot dis
honor them h\ joining the due ksat Liguni
ta. I came here not onlv to stiidv. but to
think freely and independently as well. And
it is my solid understanding that Stanford is
111 need of intense de-glamorisation. It
would honor its reputation if Stanford
could initiate the process now. How? Re
evaluating the message of a certain notori
ous film would lx- a good st.n t.

We live in a world where the rich have an
easiei time getting more than the poor do.
So Stanford fundraisers — who are too
smart to in implementing an ideology on
the world - consider a "leel-good" promo
tional video iiK ne worthwhile than one that
describes real shortages. Apparently main
donors prefei to give to those tliey eonsklei

We have an easier time finding money
for ever more opulent undergraduate op
portunities (onlv some of which include
need-based scholarships) than we do find
ing money for graduate housing stipends.
And we have .in easier lime finding money
