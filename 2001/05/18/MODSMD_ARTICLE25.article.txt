# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Popular campus attitudes ignore the perils of masturbation 
### MICHAEL R. FAINELLI GUEST COLUMNIST 
Over ilit* past 10 years, an ec
centric troupe ol sexologists
and medical doctors has
waged a PR campaign to yank
masturbation trom the pits of shame —
where it has wallowed lor all ot three
millennia —and thrust it intoa position
ol hallowed respectability. And they
have won.
I heir reasoning, whit h has merged
into conventional wisdom, goes like
this: Masturbation is just a harmless
way to exorcise the sexual longing felt
everyday In those individuals whose
flesh and blood reality will never mea
sure up to their private fantasy. II Bert
doesn't get lucky at a party, .it least he
can take solace by himself. And il he
feels any guilt about that, it's only be
cause the ghost ol Puritanism still
roams the American land, casting a veil

of shame around masturbation. That's
the new view anyway.
To the sexologists, the taboo on mas
turbation must have seemed like such a
juicy morsel. Il was forbidden In all the
right people — the Pope, the Victori
ans, the occasional 19th-centurv quack
who blamed masturbation for all kinds
of things, like syphilis, cancer or hyste
ria. How incredibly juicy- The sexolo
gists were swept up by their own enthu
siasm into ama/ing orbits of poetic
grandeur.
In an essav fora high-brow sex mag
azine, ex-Surgeon General Dr. Jovce
lvn Elders writes that masturbation
"cultivates in us a humble elegance —
an awareness that we are part of a larg
er natural system, the passions and
rhythms of which live on in us." The
very meaning of life itself! Attainable,
now, through what king off.
Once, there was a more thoughtful
view of the subject, but the view has

gone out of style. Some psychologists
and a lot ot people with real literary tal
ent — like Norman Mailer and I).II.
Lawrence and Jean-Paul Sartre — see
the shame ol masturbation as a natural
byproduct ol the act itself.
Presented with sexual energv, the
first instinct ol the masturbator is to de
stroy it in private. And so he locks him
self in a hidden place, shuts the win
dows and draws the curtains. I here, all
alone, he nurses a lurid sexual fantasy
that lilts him miles above the loneliness
of the world. For the duration of the
session, he is completely possessed In
the belief that the act of sex is being
shared with another human being, lint
in the end it all conies crashing down.
In the violence of this descent, all the
disappointment of the world and the
stark fact of solitude come rushing back
in a wave of shame. A vital energy lias
been lost, and the body is left eniptv, a
carcass of its formal self. Fvci vthing has

been given without reward, no (.'mo
tion.tl exchange with another soul.
I he same is not true of a sexual act
between two people, as pointed out by
Lawrence. "Two people ma\ destroy
one anothei in sex," he wrote in an
essay on pornography. "But they tan
not jit si produce tin- null effect ol
masturbation."
Children will inevitably masturbate
in order to explore their bodies. Hut in
adults, the resulting sense ol futility and
guilt have a "sell-protective function,"
as one psychologist put it."For they tell
the adult person, who can go out and
try to find a pat titer but settles tor auto
erotism, that something is wrong."
At Stanford, the dull beat ol chronic
masturbators is absolute!) deafening. It
is a rhythm the typical male has plaved
hundreds, il not thousands, of times be
fore arriving as .1 freshman and one
that will continue unabated through
most of adnlt lite: Post graduation, post

matrimony and post retirement. D.iv in
and day out, the sex drive was, is and
shall be thrashed into submission
rathei than allowed to run around in
the veins and animate the spirits.
So where does that leave ih? Some
might argue that, at the very le.ist. mas
turbation provides some small measure
of satisfaction. Satisfaction? What then,
explains the absolute glut of sexual
frustration on campus? Or is masturba
tion just anothei time-saving device
like fro/en dinners? I he sense that the
sexual feelings, felt in the blood and
along the heart, constitute some un
fathomable mystery may be lost in tins
era. But can we at least admit tb.it there
is nothing bumble or elegant to be got
ten bv wasting oneself on a toilet seat or
in the glow of pixilated flesh?
