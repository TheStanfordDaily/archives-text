### BILL BOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel of Santa Clara county representatives
spoke Wednesday at the l.aw School on <i pioneei ing
health care plan tli.it would provide health ( are (ov
erage to all children, regardless of immigration status
or ability to pay for services.
Panelists included |aines Beall, representative of
Distri( t Foui on the Santa ( Kara (ount\ Board of Su
pervisors, JoAnn Cabrera, executive diredoi of the
Maviicld Community Health Center, Poncho Cuc
vara, associate direc tor of the I lousing I rust of Santa
Clara County and Robert Sillen, executive director of
the Santa Clara Valley Health and Hospital Svstem.
Sherri Sager, diredoi of (ioverninent Relations at
I.ik ile Packard (Ihildrcn's Hospital, acted as model i
tor for the discussion.
I lie new llealth\ Kids program will provide all
uninsured children in Santa (-lat a (lountx with com
prehensive health (are (overage when fainih inc onie
is at or belc>w 300 percent of the federal povert\ level.
(anient state initiatives such as Medi-Cal and
Healthy Families covet children who are L .S. citi
zens or legal aliens with familv incomes up to 250
percent below the poverty level. According to the
panelists, this plan leaves out a significant portion of
children in need of medical ( are, including illegal
immigrants whose parents are afraid to apph foi
(overage and children in working poor families
whose incomes are too high to qualify loi si.ite and
federal programs.
Cuevara estimates that ovei 71,000 children in
Santa (llara ( ount\ do not have health msiii ance; ap
proximated two-thirds of these are undoe umented.
l he plan originated through a unique combina
tion of grass loots activism, support of conmninitv
leadership and the fortuitous appearance ol discre
tional v funding from a state lawsuit against tobacco
companies for health care costs from tobacco-related
disease.
Cuevara explained that the hundreds ol millions
of doll.ii s from the tobacco settlement were lelt to the
count\ to be used at their disc retion. "We saw an op
portunity to use a percentage of those resources to
help (hildren and |to| ci eate a liighei magnitude ol
health (are coverage for all. lie said.
Initiative .k ti\ ists were assisted in their campaign
l>\ faith-based organizations and labor organizations,
wlkÂ»se members alreach bad health care c(>vci age but
saw it as part of tlieii social mission to see that then
neighbors weren't left behind.
"It was an amazing proi ess. (lucvara said. "In less
than a \eai. people who bad been sitting around the
kit( hen table <lisc ussing these issues were sudden Kin
pile lied battle to make sure there was health ( are foi
tlieii neighbors."
I hough the ( it\ of San |ose narrow I\ defeated the

measure to use some of its funds to support the initia
tive, count\ supervisors went ahead with their plan.
Sillen explained that the highest priority of the or
ganizers was to get the plan up and running as soon
as possible, leaving administrative details to be dealt
with after the project got launched.
In fact, to continue the initiative county coordina
tors will have to rely on funds which have not yet ma
terialized. I he\ hope to raise funds to keep the initia
tive going through foundation grants, corporate do
nations and possibh mate lung state funds, if they can
garner enough political support for the spending.
Sillen remained optimistic that the project would
survive. "We are going to run out of money in next six
months unless the foundations come through. We
need 14 million dollai s a vear for premium support,"
he said. "But I think the\ will. I think they want to and
(he\ re not going to have a good reason not to.
In addition to providing funding for the initiative,
county officials have sought to make the health care
progi am more ac ( cssihle to residents by reducing the
often lieaw paperwork applicants have to complete
forothci government programs. 1 he application for
Health; Kids, b\ contrast, is two pages long. Unlike
most applications, it does not require Social Security
numbers of applicants, whi( li is often seen as threat
ening to residents who are in the country illegally .
Sillen and others have also been involved in out
re.u li programs to make information about the pro
grain available to residents, as well as inreach efforts
with uninsured residents who come to the hospital
seeking health care service.
"We want to make a program that is perceived as
tr\ ing to welcoming people into it and not excluding
them out of it," Sillen said.
I he panelists expressed hope that the Santa ('lara
(I(>unty initiative would become a model for similar
health care initiatives throughout the- state and the
entire nation. I liev were optimistic that similar com
inunitx activism could bring about greater funding
for health (are elsewhere around the country.
(iuevara emphasized the importance of conimuni
t\ organization in getting elected officials to change
polio decisions. " Ihe top down, closed circle ap
proai li won't work. You have to be involved in com
munity advocacy," he explained. "Fleeted officials
have to know that tlic\ have people behind them to
move these things forward. It's all about constituen
cies."
"(Hten people think l in just one person; no one
will listen to me." Sagei said. " I Ins program will
demonstrate that coinniunitv mobilization can
i hange the svstem and do it in timely fashion."
Organizers of the discussion hope that it will in
(lease campus awareness of c hildren's health care is-
sues and encourage more stu
dents to become involved.
Timothy K. Stanton, a senior
lecturer at the Medical School
who helped organize the discus
sion, explained: "This seems to be
an issue- that is not talked about at
Stanford . . . Since this is a politi
cal issue, people who care need to
get involved with the people who
have already organized on these
issues."
"Like the representatives talked
about, the number of uninsured
children is extremely high," said

senior Erica ( hung, co-director ol
Stanford Advocates for Children.
"The programs are there, it's just a
matter of getting the word out so
children can be enrolled."
Chung and other SAC mem
bers present at the event were ex
cited about tlu- opportunities ili.it
the new program will otter for
communit\ outreach. SAC mem
bers completed .1 111.iss enrollment
