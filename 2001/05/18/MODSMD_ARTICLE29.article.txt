### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Just when the waves at the new Aven Aquatic
('.enter seem calm with swimming, diving and most
tec ently women's watei polo completing their sea
sons, a new host ol competitors are being sent in to
make a majoi splash.
In its first test in its new stadium, the Cardi
nal men's water polo team will take on the U.S.
national team, in <111 oil season scrimmage that
has more sub-plots than ,111 Agatha (ihl istie mys
tery novel.
While scrimmages often exhibit a somewhat re
laxed atmosphere, the athletes hitting the pool
this weekend aren't willing to sit back and leisure
ly work on their skills. For the players on the na
tional team the s< rinnnage is the culmination ola
tough couple of mouths ol training before they
leave for two important tournaments in Europe
later this month.

And don't count out the (Cardinal men; in addi
tion to the intensity naturally generated when fil -
ing the nation's best, they will be trying to showt ase
their talent lor possible spots on tlie I .S. team.
One player certainly not new to the national
team is Cardinal freshman I'ony A/evedo. Altei
serving as one of the premier offensive players 111
the 2000 Olympics m Sydney, A/evedo returned
too late to join his new Stanford teammates 111 the
2000 season. Saturday will see the debut of A/eve
do in Cardinal red .is he meets Ins past Olvmpit
teammates 111 Ins initial game at the Farm.
"It is a chance for Stanford students to see him
play," head coach Dante Dettamanti said. " I here
has been ,1 lot of hype, and he is a great plavcr."
As if that isn't enough pressure, A/evedo's father
serves as the assistant coach of the national team.
A/evedo isn't the only one familiar with the red,
white and blue. Sophomores Jeff Nesniith and Jai
son Rohininson and senior Nick I-.llis have also
been working out with the national team, and I )ct-

tamanti also serves .is the assistant < oa< h.
In addition, there are a < ouple I '.S. plavers that
could be a little nostalgit lot Cardinal red: Woll
Wigoand 1 .a\ lie fteauhien. lleauhieu gi aduated in
1000, while W i^<» led Stan lord to national tliampi
onships in I and 100 1.
F.u from 1 ediu ing the intensity, however, the la
iniliarilx between the two teams will add to the com
petitive atmosphere in the pool. \\ hile the national
team holds the advantage in let ins ol speed and ex
perience, fans shouldn't cxpett Stanibrd to be
blown out ol the water.
"We have a 1 e«ill\, reall\ solid defense with good
goalkeepers.' Dettainanti said. "We are going to
liave work reall\ hard to s( ore, and t an t give them
the opporiuuitv to last break us.
