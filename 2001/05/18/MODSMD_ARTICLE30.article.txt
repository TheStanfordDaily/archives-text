# Dismal Pullman last chance for Card baseball title hopes
## Cardinal travels to Washington State for final regular season series 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nobodv wants to \isii rainy Pullman, Wash., in
the middle of May, and no one wants to finish in sec
ond plate in the Pacific 10 Conference fin the first
time in live years, either.
Barring a complete collapse by the No. 2 South
ern ('.alilornia I rojans .it ()regon State, however, the
seventh-ranked Cardinal will have to settle lor both
of these unenviable circumstances as it ends its regu
lar season against cellar-dwelling Washington State
this weekend.
Stanford (39-1 I, 11-7 Pac-10) led the conference
all season until it dropped a weekend series to the
I rojans and then losi twouf three games against (Cal
ifornia. I lie (Cardinal now trails I S(C (37-1 0, I 0-5) by
two games with jusi three games to go in the regular
season. In order for Stanford to claim a share of its
fifth consecutive league championship, it must
sweep the (Cougars and ()regon State must take two
of three from the I rojans.
"I'm more concerned not with il we win the l'ac
-10 but with how we're playing to end the season,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
While its confeience title hopes may be slim, Stan
lord received some good news this week when the
NCAA announc ed that, for the sixth consecutive sea
son. Stanford would be one of the 10 host sites lor the
lout-team regional playoffs that will open the NCAA
tournament next week. I be (VI tournament bids and
seedings will not be announced until Monday, tele

vised live at 12 p.m. on KSI'N.
Before il discovers its postseason match-tips, Stan
ford must deal with the (Cougars and tr\ to finish the
season on an upswing. Before winning live ol si\
games last week, the (Cardinal had slumped since
mid-April, losing six of 10 during a two-week strelc li
to close out last month.
()ne ol the reasons for the losing slide was the per
formance of the team's top two starlet s, sophomore
Jeremy Guthrie and junior (elf Bruksch. After a
near-perfect opening two and one-hall months on
the mound, the production ol boili pitchers led oil
dramatically over the past three weeks.
"To be honest with you, it's pretty unbelievable
lor Bruksch and Guthrie to pile h as well as tlie\ did
lor as long as they did," Marquess said. " I lie\ just
weren't giving up any runs, ant! I don't know il that's
humanly possible considering that usually the hit
ting gels better at this time in the vear."
Marquess concedes that neither starlet has
pitched very well lately but credits Stanford's pitching
lor the Cardinal's hot start and with helping il c limb
to the No. 1 ranking lor six weeks during the year.
Junior Mike Gosling has helped lill the void .is the
team's third starter since his return from in jut v last
month. I le has pitched his way to a 0-0 record and a
3.29 ERA with 54 strikeouts and I 7 walks this season.
An encouraging sign for Gosling has been his ability
to use the plate and his off-speed pitches effectively,
not having to rely solely on his lively fastball to gel
batters out.
Gosling is the most well rested member ol the
pitching trio, and Marquess does not rule out mov
ing him to the top of the rotation when postseason
play begins.

weekend so we'll have the llexibility to [swile h up the

Nobodv wants to \isii rainy Pullman, Wash., in
the middle of May, and no one wants to finish in sec
ond plate in the Pacific 10 Conference fin the first
time in live years, either.
Barring a complete collapse by the No. 2 South
ern ('.alilornia I rojans .it ()regon State, however, the
seventh-ranked Cardinal will have to settle lor both
of these unenviable circumstances as it ends its regu
lar season against cellar-dwelling Washington State
this weekend.
Stanford (39-1 I, 11-7 Pac-10) led the conference
all season until it dropped a weekend series to the
I rojans and then losi twouf three games against (Cal
ifornia. I lie (Cardinal now trails I S(C (37-1 0, I 0-5) by
two games with jusi three games to go in the regular
season. In order for Stanford to claim a share of its
fifth consecutive league championship, it must
sweep the (Cougars and ()regon State must take two
of three from the I rojans.
"I'm more concerned not with il we win the l'ac
-10 but with how we're playing to end the season,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
While its confeience title hopes may be slim, Stan
lord received some good news this week when the
NCAA announc ed that, for the sixth consecutive sea
son. Stanford would be one of the 10 host sites lor the
lout-team regional playoffs that will open the NCAA
tournament next week. I be (VI tournament bids and
seedings will not be announced until Monday, tele

vised live at 12 p.m. on KSI'N.
Before il discovers its postseason match-tips, Stan
ford must deal with the (Cougars and tr\ to finish the
season on an upswing. Before winning live ol si\
games last week, the (Cardinal had slumped since
mid-April, losing six of 10 during a two-week strelc li
to close out last month.
()ne ol the reasons for the losing slide was the per
formance of the team's top two starlet s, sophomore
Jeremy Guthrie and junior (elf Bruksch. After a
near-perfect opening two and one-hall months on
the mound, the production ol boili pitchers led oil
dramatically over the past three weeks.
"To be honest with you, it's pretty unbelievable
lor Bruksch and Guthrie to pile h as well as tlie\ did
lor as long as they did," Marquess said. " I lie\ just
weren't giving up any runs, ant! I don't know il that's
humanly possible considering that usually the hit
ting gels better at this time in the vear."
Marquess concedes that neither starlet has
pitched very well lately but credits Stanford's pitching
lor the Cardinal's hot start and with helping il c limb
to the No. 1 ranking lor six weeks during the year.
Junior Mike Gosling has helped lill the void .is the
team's third starter since his return from in jut v last
month. I le has pitched his way to a 0-0 record and a
3.29 ERA with 54 strikeouts and I 7 walks this season.
An encouraging sign for Gosling has been his ability
to use the plate and his off-speed pitches effectively,
not having to rely solely on his lively fastball to gel
batters out.
Gosling is the most well rested member ol the
pitching trio, and Marquess does not rule out mov
ing him to the top of the rotation when postseason
play begins.
"We'll limit the pitches (lor .ill three starters] this
weekend so we'll have the llexibility to [swile h up the
