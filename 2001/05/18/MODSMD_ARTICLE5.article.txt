According to Music Professor
|onathau Merger, research at the
('.enter revolves around three as
pects of music technology: the
human-computei interface; phys
ical modeling through instrument
building; and feature extraction,
in which information is deter
mined from audio signals.
(.RMA is not just for veterans
like Music I'rof. Max Mathews,
who, decades ago, c reated the first
software to generate complex
sounds, and whose latest rcsearc h
is on scanned synthesis. A few
dozen undergraduate and gradu
ate students mix in the vintage set
ting of the Knoll to explore the
cutting edge of composing,
recording, mixing and playing
synthetic music.

what its function is.
