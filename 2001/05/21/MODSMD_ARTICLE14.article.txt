1954
On May 21, 1054, Hit* Daily primed an
article al>ou( Senator |oseph McCarthy.
"Agroup <>l Stanford sophomores — all
<>l whom < I.urn to he ardent Republicans —
yesterda\ lauiu bed .11 ampaign to distrib
ute buttons bearing the motto, "Mc(larthy
lor luhrer,' 011 college campuses through
out ilu- nation.
"I he lour — Bill Met (all, Ben 11 arris,
Vein (llinton and Wayne Mall — all Stern
residents, laid < laims to the smut which they
said has 'ext ceded all expectations.'
" I he\ explained th.it the whole project is
nothing more than a good-natured jibe
aimed at Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.
"Letlei s explaining the purpose ol the
1 ed and white buttons have been mailed to
majoi universities, including Harvard,
Princeton, (lornell, (Columbia and LCI A.
" I he let lei s state:
"li cannot be expected th,»t the distribu
tion ol these buttons can have any direct
( onsc<]uciu es ol am gi eat significance, nor
is the idea that thev are nothing more than
<1 joke* justified.
"We believe that ridi< ule can ultimately
have more treiu bant consecjuence political
h than (an the ii 1 esolute methods now
being used to expose |oe and his 'ism.' "
Bottom line: Maybe environmentalists might
want to try something similar with Dubya.
