A hissy fit over Stanford's gradua
tion speaker got us wondering who all
the other colleges in the Bay Area have
chosen. And more importantly, how
and why did they choose them ?
Stanford, which usually gets first
pick in everything, went with the
seemingly safe choice of Hewlett-
Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Class of
1076. But this caused some students
and faculty to gripe that the choice of
Fiorina is "glaringly un-inclusive in
its appeal." Some wanted to select the
parent of a graduating senior, as high
schools do. Either parent of senior
Chelsea Clinton would do.
We also wondered where the speak
er who arrives on graduation day
falls in the student poll rankings. But
it would he impolite for school offi
cials to discuss that.
