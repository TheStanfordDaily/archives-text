The Greek Housing Review Board and the
Row House Task Force recently submitted re
ports based on student input to director of Res
idential Education Director Jane Gamarillo,
who will be hosting an open meeting regarding
the reports at 4 p.m. on May 29 in the Tresidder
()ak Room.
I he ( '.reek Housing Review Board recom
mended that three Row houses he selected this
quarter tor Greek housing to be tilled as early as
tall 2002. The board proposed that 553 May
field, 557 Mavtield and 502 Maytield he includ
ed in this group based on each house s number
ot singles and doubles, proxmiitv toother I '.reek
houses and disability access. The report notes
that selection ot these houses tor Greek organi
zations does not guarantee assignment ot the
houses to organizations.
I he report also investigated the procedures
Greek organizations must follow to apply tor
housing and the criteria such organizations
must meet to acquire or maintain housing priv
ileges.
I he board, which was divided into commit
tees consisting ot students and statl, delibei ated
tina year regarding its recommendations to( .a
inariilo. According to Assoc. Residential Kduca
tion Director John Judicki, who co-chaired the
board, the group met weeklv during winter
quarter to discuss each suhcotmnit tee's line lings.

"Students on the board were encouraged to
talk with other students and solicit opinions |ie
garding Greek housing). A survey assessment
was sent to a random sample ot undergraduates
regarding allocation ot hÂ» >uses. \\ e received a ;>0
percent response rate, " Judicki said.
The board's main suggestions include
changing the application process to accept
housing proposals from Greek organizations
every two years, implementing a mote inten
sive review ot applications and continued re
views of currently housed organizations to en
sure that tliev meet standards regarding com
munity service and leadership.
Senior Megan Huddleston, who co-chaired
the board with Judicki, acknowledged that in
creasing housing tor Greek organizations in this
manner was difficult, but stressed the benefits ot
doing so.
"I lopefullv, having a small pool ot houses that
the greater community knows could potentialh
become Greek houses will allow students, espe
cially freshmen and sophomores, to make better,
more informed housing dec isions," she s.iid.
I he Row house report included recommen
dations regarding academic resources, balance
of programming and procedures tor regular re
views. According t<> the rep<>rt,lo percent <>1 the
current sophomore ( lass lives on the Row.
1 he large number ot sophomores in sonic-
Row houses direc ted the task time's attention to
increasing the placement ot academic stall on
the Row.

"We see possible academic resources tailing
in the lealmot live-in resident lutot s. .. and ad
vising associates tor sophomores, similar to statl
in l'oyon," ('.amarillo said. "Another idea from
the group was to look .it inviting teat liing assis
tants to hold review sessions in houses where
there are a large number ot sophomores taking
the same classes."
However, ( .amarillo emphasized that there
would be no move to install residential facultx
on the Row.
"The idea is to infuse tac ultv energv without
having them li\e in a Row house. Affiliated tac -
nitv would have some expectation ot mentor
ship that goes bevond a<l\ ising on what (kisses
students can take, like guiding students in
thinking about majors or research or giving ad
vice about whittling clown a papci to a better lo
dised theme," ('.amai illo said.
"On the Row, we have student managers,
and lots of learning about leadership comes
from that experience, but there's still a need in
the pre-declaration phase lor some kinds ot ac a
demic < onnec lions. We want to presei ve the in
clepencleiu e and autonomy that goes with living
on the Row, but don't want it completely devoid
ot having academic support there, (.amarillo
said.
Senior (iarmel I e\ itan, a member ot the task
force, saicl she agreed that many students
strongly voiced their desire to maintain the
