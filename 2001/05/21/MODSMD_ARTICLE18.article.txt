flut how can the situation be ameliorated?
Honors College, which takes place for two weeks
prior to the beginning of fall quarter, is a good
foundation. Attending the college gets students
thinking about their projects, streamlining ideas
and gives tlieni a head start on research. Most im
portantly, though, Honors College establishes a
support group of students for students and fosters
interaction with fat ulty who can provide encour
agement and guidance throughout the process.
One major problem with Honors College,
however, lies in maintaining this support group.
Fo that end, every department — whether hu
manities, social sciences or hard sciences —
should hold mandator) thesis-related seminars,
along with community-building social events that
include every faculty member involved in the
pre>c ess.
Another issue concerns the competence and
availability of thesis advisers. While some faculty
advisers become intiniatch involved in their ad-

visees' projects with frequent meetings, in-depth
consultation and even rough-draft editing, others
remain aloof, providing little help and guidance.
Understandably, faculty are busy and some lake
more interest in undergraduates than others.
Kut, because of this variability, every department
should consider appointing one faculty member
dedicated to helping students through the pro
cess. Stanford should also look into creating a se
ries of University-wide positions for thesis editors,
much like writing tutors, who can assess students'
work independently.
Among schools ol its caliber and reputation,
Stanford lies near the bottom in terms of the per
centage of its students who complete theses. No
one is suggesting that the University obligate all
seniors to write a thesis, .is schools like Princeton
do, but it has 110 excuse to shirk its responsibility
to c reate a hospitable and supportive environ
ment in which students can pursue original hon
ors research.

flut how can the situation be ameliorated?
Honors College, which takes place for two weeks
prior to the beginning of fall quarter, is a good
foundation. Attending the college gets students
thinking about their projects, streamlining ideas
and gives tlieni a head start on research. Most im
portantly, though, Honors College establishes a
support group of students for students and fosters
interaction with fat ulty who can provide encour
agement and guidance throughout the process.
One major problem with Honors College,
however, lies in maintaining this support group.
Fo that end, every department — whether hu
manities, social sciences or hard sciences —
should hold mandator) thesis-related seminars,
along with community-building social events that
include every faculty member involved in the
pre>c ess.
Another issue concerns the competence and
availability of thesis advisers. While some faculty
advisers become intiniatch involved in their ad-

visees' projects with frequent meetings, in-depth
consultation and even rough-draft editing, others
remain aloof, providing little help and guidance.
Understandably, faculty are busy and some lake
more interest in undergraduates than others.
Kut, because of this variability, every department
should consider appointing one faculty member
dedicated to helping students through the pro
cess. Stanford should also look into creating a se
ries of University-wide positions for thesis editors,
much like writing tutors, who can assess students'
work independently.
Among schools ol its caliber and reputation,
Stanford lies near the bottom in terms of the per
centage of its students who complete theses. No
one is suggesting that the University obligate all
seniors to write a thesis, .is schools like Princeton
do, but it has 110 excuse to shirk its responsibility
to c reate a hospitable and supportive environ
ment in which students can pursue original hon
ors research.
