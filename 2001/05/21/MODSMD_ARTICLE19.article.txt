# JUST A BIT OUTSIDE
## And the award goes to... 
### 
The deadline was last night al mid
night. II you didn't nominate a
prolessor U>i the this year's leat h
ing awards, it's too late now. ll'von
did, more powci to vou. Asa son ola lot met
I ( L\ prolessor, I know how much these
nominations mean to them.
And, yet, I struggled with tin letter ol
nomination. Its not that I didn't have am
outstanding professors at Stanford. I did.
It's not that I didn't have the time to stop
<md thank them in this wav. I did. It's just
that, when I look b.t< k.it inv lour vears at

Stanford, it's hard to {>i< k
one professor thai
( handed nn thinking and
influenced my life.
Instead I picked two.
I cannot speak for the
tec liit-s. I <a 11 not find my
way to the Biology De
partment with <1 map. And
I hesitate 111 public l\ sliai

in); ni\ nominations, in tli.it it might em
barrass the two men I praise, lint, il I can
convince |nst one of you to take .1 class with
eitliei man, the temporary embarrassment
will Ik' well wc>rth it.
Join nalisin IVc>f. William Wc«> will n< >1 win
the teaching award. I lis < lasses are small. Ins
skill a specialty. Woo teaches journalism-rc
lated < lasses,tilingslike( lommunication 177:
"()pinion W1 it 111^." Most of his students are
jK'ople with m>ine sort of < areer aspiration 111
the join nalisin 01 < ommunic at ion field. Most
people in Ins (lasses are graduate students.
I le enjo\s having undergraduates, too; the)
just don't usualh find him.
And, \et. an\ student would Ix-nelil from
taking a (lass with \\'« h».
Woo is one ol the most caring men .it
Stanford. W illi a soft-spoken tone, he walks
the room and leaches through stones and
e\|H i ienc e. I le knows Ins audience person
ally and e.istK engages it. All of the students
will Im-( (»inc- Ix'ttei wl iters, ol this there is 110
douht. Kut what they don't realize is that
Woo will teach them to Ik- Ix'tter people.
A slide projector throws a photograph
on to the wall. It's ,1 sliol ol .1 dead bov's
Ixklv, removed from the lake where he has
drowned. In the photograph, the family
cries out in grief. I he boy's mother
sc reams in horror.
W'oo tin lis to vou. You edit a newspaper,
he sa\s. Your photoeditot has jiisi come to
you with the pic ture thai will ccrtainlv win
multiple photograpln awards. Il tells tin
stone 111 one lion il\ ing glance. If a pic lure is
worth 1,000 words, well, this one is worth
2.(MM)or.S, (MM)fot sure.
I he photoeditoi wants you to run 11 011
the front page. I lie si on of the drowning
is not necessarih front-page news 111 your

(itv What do vou do? Do vou run it? Do
vou listen to youi photo editor? Do you
recogni/e that this lias Pulil/ci potential
and spread it on the Iron I page soi hildrcn
will see it as the\ eat I licit cereal over the
breakfast table?
Woo won't tell \ou what to do. Hut he will
leach you scnsitivilv. lie will sax that he
would (onta< t the family to speak with them
about the reasons behind Ins decision
whatcvei tli.it dci ision nia\ Ih-. I le will make
vou think. I le will tell you that vou (annot
hope to live vout lile with one set ol morals
and operate with a dillereni set lor your (a
reeroi professional field. And, altei the de
bate is done, aliei vou have thought alxml
this loi almost two hours, lie will show you
how the Hakcrslicld Sun ran it on the front
page, i iglit next to a large photograph ol .1
I >isncy (hatatler.
I he (lass ends, and Woo slays to dis
cuss the issue some more.
John I.'l Icurcux's novels engage. 1 lie
more pages that are turned, the more the
rcadci is sucked in. It's something .ilw nit the
voice — wiltv and intriguing. I hs< lasses are
miK h the same.
I I leureux teat lies Knglish and (reative
wi iling < out ses. S<>nie (lasses are lai gc and
lc( lure-oriented, while otlici s arc small and
discussion-based. In the laller, lie will lake
the tunc to learn cat h ol the 25 or so names
ol lhe students, their tnajot sand their inter
ests. Me will ask these students what they
thought of |oyce. ol Hemingway, ol Albee.
ol whatever was read lot tli.it day's class.
I I lis will guide the discussion. I le will tease
and entci tain, educate and enlighten.
He is one of the most knowledgeable,
most prepared prolcssors I have ever had.
But lie is also so vcrv personable — a skill
main professors lack no mailer how hard
they try.
1.1 leureux is the kind ol'professor I
imagined Ixing here when I tame lo such a
prestigious university, lie's something out
ol "Dead Poet's Society," a prolessor who
not onl\ < arcs, but gets the students ext iletl
«ind gels excited himself just to l>e here. 111
.111 Knglish (lass he once taught 011 plays,
1.1 leureux stood and read, altering his
voice lot eat h of the three characters. I lie
students roared with delight.
No mailer what you study at Stanford,
vou aic not getting a complete education
without a ( lass taught by L'Heurcux. It's
not work, it's pleasure. Reading great lic
tion is enjoyable. (doming to class the next
d.i\ and having a professor open your eyes
to so many other stories within that reading
is invaluable.

liruin Hide would like In thank nil of his ftrofes
\t>r\. especially because he's not taking classes
