Daily handled reparations ad with
'courage and good judgment'
I lie Stanford Dailv's treatment ol my
reparations ad and the controversy sur
rounding it is.l model for what other campus
papers should have done but in most cases
didn't. I commend I lie Daily lot its good
judgment as journalists, its at t urate report -
ingand itscouragein producing.m issue that
has turned this whole allair into a learning
experience lor the Stanford ctimmunity.
()nc point I would like to respond to in
the Black Student I nion's statement is that
my suggestion that African Americans owe a
debt lo America "isollensivc and grounded
in racist ideology." I lerc is what Hooker I .
Washington, himscll a former slave, had to
say 011 the same subject:" I hink alioul it: We
went into slavery |)agans; we tame out
Christians. We went into slavery pieces of
properiv; we came out American citizens.
We went into slavery with chains clanking
alxnil our wrists; we came out with the
American ballot in our hands. Notwith
standing the cruelly and moral wrong of
slavery, we are in a stronger and more hope
ful position, materially, intellectually,
morally antl religiously, than is true of an
equal number of black people in any other
portion of the glolx\"

Author ignores the benefits
of masturbation
I have to admit, when I began to read

Michacl lainelli's guest column on Friday
("Popular campus altitudes ignore the per
ils of masturbation"), i originally thought it
was a joke. A lew sentences into the article,
though, I Ixgan to realize that the author
was serious, and at this point I cannot help
hut respond.
lust ofl, the sordid picture of "mas
turbators" — as opposed to normal
human beings, I presume — Fainelli
paints is incorrect. According to the au
thor. anyone who masturbates does so
because ol desperation and invariably
bieaks clown in shame afterwards. If that
is true lot Fainelli, then I feel very sorry
for him. Hut he can rest assured that
many people masturbate frequently
without feeling the crushing shame that
Fainelli calls "a natural byproduct" of
masturbation.
Also, most people are not "completely
possessed by the belief th.it the act of sex
is being shared with another human
being" during sell-gratification. In most
cases, people are quite aware that their
fantasies are just th.it and enjoy them
anyway.
Even the image of masturbation being
nothing but the pathetic pleasure of those
who cannot get release any other way is
wrong. Most people who are in sexual rela
tionships still masturbate — as a supple
ment to their sex life, .is a wonderful way to
relax, sometimes even together with their
partner.
Most importantly, though, the author's
main argument is remarkably outdated.
The idea of a "vital energy" that we need to
let "run around in our veins and animate

lilt* spirits" ,md that would Ix 1 lost by mas
turbating was popular 1(H) years ago, but
lias since lx'en soundly debunked. In its
heyday, this theory was mostly based on the
idea that semen was a source of male
strength and expelling it would weaken the
Ixxlv and soul. In this world view, women
apparently never masturbate.
Now, Fainelli need not worry: No mat
ter how much he masturbates, his bodv
can produce plenty more of the stuff to
make up for it. And, if he chooses to re
main "unsullied," .ill that will happen to
his precious bodily fluids is that his body
will digest them to prevent buildup. Noth
ing will "run around in his veins" and give
him any benefit.
I fowever, il he chooses to masturbate,
plenty of rc.il things will run around in
his veins. Medical studies have shown
that masturbation has a multitude of
very real physical effects. Endorphins in
his blood will increase, making him feel
happy — unless he chooses to crush this
feeling with shame and guilt. His level <>l
Cortisol and other stress hormones will
decrease, thus lowering his risk for hy
pertension, heart disease and many
other health problems. In the case of a
female "offender," masturbation will
also ameliorate menstrual cramps. All of
these and many more benefits, and, best
of all, it's free!
I hope Fainelli will overcome his fears
and illusions about masturbation. He can
only gain from it.
