Paul Khrlit hand Stephen St hneider,
both prolessors of biological sciences,
i.tiled loi student support ol the Kyoto
Protocol in ,i sMuposiuiu on climate
change Friday aliei noon.
I lie event drew an audience of f>o to (>0
people, most ol the-m students. I lie sym
posium was sponsored In Kvoto Now! and
the Redwood At lion I earn <it Slanlord.
"It is netessai v to show that alternative
behavioi is win-win," Schneider said. lie
explained that market ineHieieneies need
to be tot tet ted in order lor energy elli
(ienc\ to be improved. For example, the
costs ol replacing energy inellit ieni tech
nologies areolien less than the act umulal
etl energy costs over the lifetime ol that
let hnoloirv.

Schneider conceded that, on a national
level, "people will get left behind in the
transition to better systems." The transi
tion to energy efficient systems would in
volve the loss of jobs in older industries
and require that these workers be fur
nished with new skills. Certain changes
necessary to alleviate the threat of climate
change, such as higher energy prices,
would adversely ailed the poor, whom he
advocates should be given rebates.
"()ften, equity issues seem to be entirely
left out, but they are extremely important
in the international arena," St hneider said.
I he trees may be growing back 111 the I nit -
ed Stales and Europe, he said, but, "during
the Industrial Revolution, we used sweat
shops and burned coal to get rich."
in 111 is light, he argued, the exemptions
loi developing< ountries in the Kvoto Pro
tocol on climate change are more just if i

able. He suggested that developed coun
tries should provide the capital nccessan
lor developing countries' efforts to 1 educe
greenhouse emissions. 1 o convince public
opinion of the need lor such measures,
Schneider emphasized the neetl for
"charismatic leadership."
Schneider said he was more optimistic
about the prospects til changing the be
havior of companies, proposing that envi
ronmentalists are divided between the
"analytic" and the "emotive," and that in
dustry is divided between the "ideological"
and the "practical." I le noted that analytit
environmentalists often share ninth in
common with the more "practical" ele
ments in industry.
Industry managers are younger and
their values are < hanging, St hneidet said.
As evidence of this, he cited Chevron,
which has created an environmental de

partment as "a sort of internal fifth col
umn" charged with reporting on the im
provements the company should make in
order it) bet time more responsible envi
ronmentally.
Both professors urged students to indi
cate it) the relevant authorities that sus
tainable living is a priority. Students were
encouraged to put pressure on the Office
of Development and Stanford donors to
demand that new buildings are energv ef
ficient â€” improving upon, rather than
only meeting, existing building codes.
Fhrlich advised students to write to their
representatives in Congress in support ol
the Kvoto Protocol.
Scnioi Jonathan Neril, who organized
tlie event with senior Carolvn Kousk\
and junior Nina Robertson, said, "The
talk was organized to promote a< lion by
the President's and Provost's Offices to

commit to reducing Stanford's green
house gas emissions."
I lie organizers <>l the event presented
charts indi< .iting the increase in Stanford's
energy consumption. " Though we were
encouraged and heartened by the
progress made In the newly formed hnvi
ronmeni.tl Stewardship Management
Group, we feel the administration could
take other actions to confront global cli
mate change," Neril said.
