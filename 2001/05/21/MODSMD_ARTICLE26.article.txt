## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) â€” A day
after a threat in Arab ministers to
halt all political contacts with Is
rael. President Hosni Mubarak
said yesterday that Kgvpt and Jor
dan will not give up their eflorts to
relaunch the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks.
"The Egyptian-Jordanian ini
tiative is still on the table, and we
should continue (eflorts) to reacti
vate it, Mubarak told reporters.
On Saturday, the Arab League
recommended "stopping all Arab
political contacts with the Israeli
government as long as the aggres
sion and blockades against the
Palestinian people and the Pales
tinian Authority continue."
Hut in a statement, Egypt's For
eign Minister Ahmed Maher said
the recommendation will not affect
Egypt's ties with Israel.
" 1 his has nothing to do with the
peace trcatv and has nothing to do
with embassies, which will contin
ue working normally," Maher said
Sunday.
Egypt, bound by a 1979 peace
treaty with Israel, has always re
jected calls from radical Arabs to
severe ties with the Jewish state, in
sisting that keeping the contacts
has helped advance the Mideast

peace process. Egypt and Jordan
are the only Arab countries to have
signed peace agreements with Is
rael.
Mubarak did not refer Sunday
to the Arab League resolution, but
he reiterated Egvpt's willingness to
plav a major role in continuing to
mediate the peace process.
In Medford, Mass., I N. Set re
tary-Ceneral Kofi Annan said lie
was pleased with Mubarak's com
ments.
"1 was encouraged when I
heard . . . that President Mubarak
liacl indicated he would continue
his eflorts for peace, Annan told a
news conference. He said the role
of Egypt and |ordan in the peace
process "is very important and 1
hope they will stay engaged."
Mubarak accused the govern
ment of Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon of trying to under
mine the Egyptian-Jordanian ini
tiative. seen as one of the more se
rious efforts to quell eight months
of violence between Israel and the
Palestinians.
The Egyptian-Jordanian pro
posal calls on Israel to freeze con
struction of Jewish settlements be
fore a truce, then resume negotia
tions fora peace deal.
