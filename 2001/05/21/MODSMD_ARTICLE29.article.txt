the year with a score of 5-2. (an ient players
senior Sarah Pestieau and juniors Keiko
lokuda, Tauten Kalvaria and Cabriela
lustra are the only remaining members
from that squad.
Tast year, the women's team ('M)-l) fell in
the championship game to upset-minded
(Georgia in Malihu. Irvin was by then
ranked the top player in the nation, and
( tu rent sophomore Laura (Granville was.in
up-and-coming No. .'V I he memory ol tli.it
deleat, the ('.ardinal's only loss since March
5, 1999, hangs heavily on the backs of the
returning players.

hammered familiar Pacific 10 Conference

feat of Mlian i Brown. Because the win was
alreach secured for Stanlord, the hotly an

pended.
