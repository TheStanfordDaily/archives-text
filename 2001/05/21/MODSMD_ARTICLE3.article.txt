Hie event consisted of three panels: "Be
yond Silicon Valley: Hot I echnology
I'rends," "Tecli 1 ratisfer: I translating Tech
nologv into Viable Businesses" and "After

the Adrenaline Rush: Sustaining Cirowth in
a More Rational Market." Ihe dav-long
event was sponsored In the Kngineering
School, Kngineering Alumni Relations .ind
Stanford l ec hnology Ventures Program.
Approximately .'{()() Stanford engineering
alumni, students, faculty and their guests
were in attendance.
l om Byers, .1 professor of management
science and engineering, moderated a panel
titled "After the Adrenaline Rush: Sustain
ing (irowtli in a More Rational Market" and
said that, aside from having a bond through
.i "Stanford connection," participants were
also drawn together In "an interest and a
love and passion lor entrcprcneurship."
Byers began by asking the panelists to de
fine what entrepreneurship meant to tlieni.
"To me, entrepreneurship means mak
ing something out of nothing, " said David
Rickey, ( lass of 1981 and chairman and
chief executive offic er of Applied Micro (lir
cuits ( >orp.

anything."
lo mc, entrepreneurship
iiu-ans taking calculated risks and
building something ol signifi
canee," said Mike Volpi, C lass ol
,md mechanical engineering
.ind ehiel strategy ollicer .it Cisco
Systems.
Byers also asked panel mem
bers to give their lake on the econ
omy and to sa\ whether they were
optimistic oi pessimistic about the
future.
"I'm in total denial — don't
confuse me with the f;i(ts. I'm ig
noring the whole thing, it's not
happening." Ric key said, receiving
tnuc h applause from the audience.
"If you want to fx- an entrepre
neur and vou're not optimistic, go
do some thing else," ( olctnan said.
"I'm super positive; there's not a
recession."
Volpi oflered a more cautious
approach.

"I think that in this industry we
have gone through an unprece
dented last live or six years, to the
point where I do think there was a
definite euphoria. I lungs got
funded that shouldn't have been
funded; things went public that
shouldn't have gone public. We
are absolutely optimistic, but I
think we're optimistic about real
value creation as opposed to eu
phoric value creation, which is
what we observed, 1 think, in the
last live or six years." Volpi said.
"Ileing optimistic is the right thing,
but not blindly so. there's really
that focus on value creation."
Sat yen Kothari, (ilass of 1997
and CKO and co-founder of
I rape/o, said that he enjoyed the
event and found it to be a very
w<>rthwhile experience.
"The panels were amazing
because they included people
who have real-world experi
ence," Kothari said. "It also
makes you value the Univer
sity and the connections and
resources that it offers."
Mehrdad lleshami, who re
ceived his doctorate in engineer
ing. .ilso praised the event, but
adder! that "this year there was less
energy Ixxause start-up fever is

lower and hist year there were
more people."
Plummer said that attendance
this year was lower, but onl\ by a
small percentage. In addition, he
ollered a diflerent view of the en
ergy level .it the event.
" The attendance was probably a
little lower this year (by] 10 per
cent, but still very large," he said.
1 didn't sense any drop in energy
level, simply a more realistic view
of the future than existed last
year."
Plummer also said tlicit he fell
the event was a success and said
that the event would most likely
take place again next year because
of the positive response it has re
ceived. In addition, he ollered his
take on the future of the economy.
"Most people I talked with
thought the panels were great
and that the discussions were en
gaging. Last year, we were in a pe
riod of euphoria with respect to
startups, as many of the panel
members stated. I agree with
them that what we see now is a re
turn to normalcy," Plummer said.
"I think the culture we see in Sili
con Valley today is permanent. It
works and it's made this valley
what it is today."

value creation as opposed to eu
phoric value creation, which is
what we observed, 1 think, in the
last live or six years." Volpi said.
"Ileing optimistic is the right thing,
but not blindly so. there's really
that focus on value creation."
Sat yen Kothari, (ilass of 1997
and CKO and co-founder of
I rape/o, said that he enjoyed the
event and found it to be a very
w<>rthwhile experience.
"The panels were amazing
because they included people
who have real-world experi
ence," Kothari said. "It also
makes you value the Univer
sity and the connections and
resources that it offers."
Mehrdad lleshami, who re
ceived his doctorate in engineer
ing. .ilso praised the event, but
adder! that "this year there was less
energy Ixxause start-up fever is

lower and hist year there were
more people."
Plummer said that attendance
this year was lower, but onl\ by a
small percentage. In addition, he
ollered a diflerent view of the en
ergy level .it the event.
" The attendance was probably a
little lower this year (by] 10 per
cent, but still very large," he said.

level, simply a more realistic view
of the future than existed last
year."
Plummer also said tlicit he fell
the event was a success and said
that the event would most likely
take place again next year because
of the positive response it has re
ceived. In addition, he ollered his
take on the future of the economy.
"Most people I talked with
thought the panels were great
and that the discussions were en
gaging. Last year, we were in a pe
riod of euphoria with respect to
startups, as many of the panel
members stated. I agree with
them that what we see now is a re
turn to normalcy," Plummer said.
"I think the culture we see in Sili

works and it's made this valley
what it is today."
Despite I lie uirreni economic downturn,
optimism reigned .n the second annual Kn
trepreneurs Day, held Saturday at the

I he primary goal ol the event is to con

school. "I hey are one ol our principal 'prod
ucts,' the other one being new knowledge.
We think maintaining strong connections
with our alums will he of great benefit to
them — because they'll hear about the- latest
work going on in our labs and (lassrooms —
.ind ol great benefit to us because their ca

Hie event consisted of three panels: "Be
yond Silicon Valley: Hot I echnology
I'rends," "Tecli 1 ratisfer: I translating Tech
nologv into Viable Businesses" and "After

the Adrenaline Rush: Sustaining Cirowth in
a More Rational Market." Ihe dav-long
event was sponsored In the Kngineering
School, Kngineering Alumni Relations .ind
Stanford l ec hnology Ventures Program.
Approximately .'{()() Stanford engineering
alumni, students, faculty and their guests
were in attendance.
l om Byers, .1 professor of management
science and engineering, moderated a panel
titled "After the Adrenaline Rush: Sustain
ing (irowtli in a More Rational Market" and
said that, aside from having a bond through
.i "Stanford connection," participants were
also drawn together In "an interest and a
love and passion lor entrcprcneurship."
Byers began by asking the panelists to de
fine what entrepreneurship meant to tlieni.
"To me, entrepreneurship means mak
ing something out of nothing, " said David
Rickey, ( lass of 1981 and chairman and
chief executive offic er of Applied Micro (lir
cuits ( >orp.
Bill (loleman, Class of l ( .)7(i and chair-

anything."
lo mc, entrepreneurship
iiu-ans taking calculated risks and
building something ol signifi
canee," said Mike Volpi, C lass ol
,md mechanical engineering
.ind ehiel strategy ollicer .it Cisco
Systems.
Byers also asked panel mem
bers to give their lake on the econ
omy and to sa\ whether they were
optimistic oi pessimistic about the
future.
"I'm in total denial — don't
confuse me with the f;i(ts. I'm ig
noring the whole thing, it's not
happening." Ric key said, receiving
tnuc h applause from the audience.
"If you want to fx- an entrepre
neur and vou're not optimistic, go
do some thing else," ( olctnan said.
"I'm super positive; there's not a
recession."
Volpi oflered a more cautious
approach.

"I think that in this industry we
have gone through an unprece
dented last live or six years, to the
point where I do think there was a
definite euphoria. I lungs got
funded that shouldn't have been
funded; things went public that
shouldn't have gone public. We
are absolutely optimistic, but I
think we're optimistic about real
value creation as opposed to eu
phoric value creation, which is
what we observed, 1 think, in the
last live or six years." Volpi said.
"Ileing optimistic is the right thing,
but not blindly so. there's really
that focus on value creation."
