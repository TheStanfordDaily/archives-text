PIIIIADFFPHIA (AP) — Allen Iverson
passed Ins biggest test, not l>\ scoring 59 points
again l)iii by passing the ball and trusting his
teammates.
And in a game tli.it came clown to the l.ist
shot, Vinee(latter —"I he Graduate"— didn't
have the final answer.
Iverson didn't have to win (lame 7 .ill b\
liiinself, and he was smart enough to know it.
I binding of! a career-high If> assists on .i night
when Ins shooting touch was off, Iverson led
the Philadelphia 7(iei s into the Fastern ( onfer
cnce finals vcstcrclav asthe\ edged the loron
to Raptc >is, 88-87.
(larter. who graduated from North (larolina
earliet vesteiclav and then flew on .i private
|)l.iue to Philadelphia, attempted the final shot
of the game — a 2!Mooter just before the
buz/ci that was ,i little 100 long.
Iverson ran to hug Ins tnoihei and his kids,
con let t i fell from I lie ceiling of the I irst I nion
(lentei and the rest of the Sixers c elebralecl the
franchise's first trip to the Fastei n (lonfeicncc
finals sine e 1985.
I he 7(>ci s will begin their series against Mil
waukee at home on I ucsdav night.
"I wanted to clo something special, but the
wa\ you draw it ii|) — il you're a score! — is
having a great scoring night. In a million veais
I'd i level believe I'd come out and have a ( a reel
high in assists,' l\eison said.
"1 feel so good about this win bee ause I i cal
ls, icalk know inside and believe that I have a
team, fin the fiisi tune in ni\ life-, that I leel we
< an win a c hainpionship with."

None of those teamm.ites came up bigger
than Aaron M< Kie, whose 22 points were one
more than Iverson totaled on H-for-27 shoot
ing.
Mc Kie shot 8-for-11) and scored Philadel
phia's final four points, jumainc Jones shot
6-for-9 and added If), Flic Snow con
tributed IS points and five assists and
Dikembe Mutonibo grabbed 17 rebounds
and s< oreel 1 0 points.
Iverson, the le ague MVP nic knamed " I he
Answer, didn't score a point over the final <>
I 2 minutes but had assists on two of the Sixci s*
final three baskets.
In a series marked In spectaculai 50-point
scoring performances In Iverson (twice) and
(larter (once), the deciding game was much
more balanced foi both teams.
Iversons passing made all the difference as
lie continualk found the open man lor the
t\ pes of shots ihat allowed the Sixers to hold on
to the- lead loi almost the entire game.
"I've got lour other guvs on the court with
me that I hurt with, laugh with, and that's what
it's .ill .iboiit. You can't get into a (-aine 7, with
the guvs w ho were with you all seas<>n. and loi -
gel about them because you think its .ill about
vou." Iveison said.
( l.utci finished with 20 points, scoring |ust
foui in the final quarter. Antonio l)a\is led
Foronto with 2M.
Deli ( nil \ pulled up in transition and hit a
K-pointei to pull the Raptors to 88-87 with 51
seconds It-It. Iverson missed a junipei at the
other end, but I none I lill grabbed the offen

sive rebound and the Sixers ran the clock down
to 10 sec c»ncls before Iverson passed to Sin >w for
a juniper that missed.
I he Raptors rebounded, but didn't call
timeout until H.f> seconds remained. I lie Six
ers had a foul to give and used it — running
the < lock clown to 2.0 seconds — before (larter
got free lot the inbouncls pass and faked I lill
off Ins leel.
"All I can think about is that shot. It's some
thing vou live for," (larter said. "Mavbe next
year."
It was a disappointing loss for the Raptors,
who battled from behind all evening only to
finish short in the first (lame 7 — and the first
conference semifinal appearance — in fran
chise history.
Although he wasn't shooting well right from
the start, Iverson was doing all the little- tilings
the Sixers needed. I le had a dunk and a layup
oil 11is fii si two steals, and his fifth assist came on
a give-and-go layup In Mc kie that put the Six
ei s ahead 29-1 (>.
I oronto began the second quarter with an
8-0 run to pull within two, MI -29, but
Philadelphia c ame right back with a 10-,'J run
thai included two putbacks bv |ones. After
one ol them, two of the Raptors pointed lin
gers ol blame at |eronie Williams — a clear
sign the\ weren't all working together.
I vei son had one ol his best plays on 1 oron
lo's next possession, racing downcourt and
leaping a loot above the rim to get a linger on
Akin Williams' last-break lav up attempt, caus
ing him to miss.
