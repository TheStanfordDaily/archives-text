MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Kira Ching looks to turn a double play in the first regional championship
game this weekend.
Among them were the Central
Michigan Chippawas (37-20) and
the Pacific Tigers (50-13), both
teams that had in years past sent
the (Cardinal home short of a world
series berth.
"I felt like it was fate," said senior
Jenni Shideler. "They all were
coining here, and we had a second
c hanc e to show them what we were
all about."
And the Cardinal did exactly
that.
In the first game of the series,
Stanford set the tone for the rest of
the tournament with a 4-0 victor)'
over the I lofstra Pride (37-20). I lie
spell of postseason first-game losses
had been broken, and the (Cardinal
knew that this time it was going to
be different.
Stanford was then given the op
portunity it was hoping for, a sec
ond < bailee against the (Chippawas.
I his time around, Stanford
iiK.de it (leai that it would not be
ending its season early, as the
Cardinal pounded out 12 hits
and posted six runs in its second
win of the weekend. In this win,
sophomore kira (Cliing and ju
nior Jessica Mendo/a each
turned in an impressive 3-for-5
performance at the plate. Mau
reen l.cCocq earned the win,
st.ii ting four of the seven innings
in the < ire le.
()ne day later, the (Cardinal con
tinued Us flawless performance
with a win over the second-seeded
Ncbi ask.i (Cm nhuskci s.
I he (Cat dinal downed I he
(Coi nhuskers, 5-1. in seven innings
of pla\. Sophomore Dana
Sorensen led the( Cardinal from the
c ire le, as she did in four of the five
games of the tournament.
While Nebraska jumped to an
early I -0 advantage, Stanford took
over the- lead in the bottom of the
liist. Sophomore Robin Walker
singled to light followed by a Men
do/a triple to even the score, fhe
Cardinal wasted little time before

attacking again, when Ching hit a
ground ball to the right side, dri
ving in Mendoza and posting an
other run for Stanford.
The game remained at 2-1 until
the fourth inning, when Beeson
reached base after being hit by a
pitch. Ching came through again
with runners on, when she drove a
single up the middle. With run
ners in scoring position and a 3-2
count, sophomore Cassi Brang
ham ( .nnc- through in the dutch,
sending a shot over the left field
er's head, driving in two runs for
the (Cardinal.
And Stanford did not end
there.
Shideler followed with a double
of her own, bringing Brangham
home for the fifth run of the game.
Stanford held the store at 5-1
for the remainder of the game and,
with the win, automatically put it
self in the championship game.
I he regional tournament fol
lows a double elimination format,
and the Cardinal went into yes
terday's games with no losses
against a Pacific team ili.it had al
ready dropped one game to Ne
braska on Friday.
Pacific pulled out a 2-0 win in
the first meeting of the day. The
game remained scoreless going
into the top of the fourth, when
Tiger senior Adrienne Ratajc/ak
reached base on a walk. She then
stole second base, putting her in
scoring position tbi Estee ()kumu
ra's infield single that followed.
I he plav at the plate was close, but
Katajc/ak slid nuclei the tag, mak
ing the score I -0.
Pacific added an insurance rim
in the lop of the sixth, when Rata
jc/ak walked again, followed In
Okumura being hit by a pitch to
place runners on first and second.
Boni Rading than stepped into
the box and sent a two-out single
up the middle to drive in the sec -
ond Pacific i tin of the game.
I lie Cardinal onlv produced
two hits in the- loss, as 1 igei pitch
er Cindy Ball kept the Stanford
squad of! balance with one of her
best performances all season.
I thought (.indy Ball did an

excellent job of pitching her
game," said head coach John
Rittman. "I think we were a little
tight and defensively made a few
misc ues and gave the momentum
to them early in the game and
never reallv recaptured it."
I lic loss was a hard one and
threatened the Cardinal's trip to
()klahoma, but it was onlv the first
game of the day.
"I think we were kind of pi.ty
ing not to lose in the first game,
instead of going out and t.iking
c harge and plaving like we have
been all weekend," Rittman said.
In the true championship
game of ilic- dav. the ( animal did
take- charge, c apturing a convinc -
ing 9-1 vic torv over the Tigers.
Stanford wasted no time, as it
banged out three hits and scored
two runs in the first inning.
Ihe Cardinal tallied up one
more run in the top of the second
as Shideler, in her last true at-bat
on the- Farm, sent a towering shot
over tlu- center-field fence for the
third run of the game.
I he score remained at 3-0
going in to the fourth when Men
do/a stepped into the box with
two outs and the bases loaded. As
she has all season, Mendoza
stepped in to the box confident
and hungry and sent her Fltli
home run of the year over the
fence, smashing the single-season
rec orcl she set in 2000.
"When the pitch came, I just
kind of reacted, said Mendoza,
who was named the Most Out
standing Pl.iver on the All-1 ourna
nient team. "It was just a rush of
emotions. I wanted to scream as
soon as it went out. I wanted to live
that moment forever. I his is what
we play lor."
And a trip to ()klahoina (lity is
exactlv what the Cardinal has
been playing for all year. As the
last pitch was thrown and sopho
more l ori Nvberg c losed out the
championship win, the red and
white ( rc-pe paper flew, the water
cooler was appropriated emptied
onto coach Rittman's back and the
Stanford team celebrated like it
nevei had before.
