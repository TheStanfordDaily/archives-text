Volunteers in the Stanford Alliance for
Service through the Arts are integrating
their talents and love of the arts with their
desire to serve the community. I his stu
dent-run community service organiza
tion focuses on serving underprivileged
communities through the incorporation
of the arts.

Serving both the young and elderly
populations, the group has seven differ
ent programs. Students can volunteer
with Musii Enrichment Learning on De
veloping Youth, a piano teaching pro
gram; Stanford ()utrea< h ('.oncert Series,
a perft (nuance group that goes to a hospi
tal and <i nursing home; TUT"I 1. an or
chestra mentorship program; Epic I'he
at re for ( h dinarv People, a theater group
th.it performs at a hospital and a nursing

home; Rhythmic (ivmnastic s; SAS I A Pal
let and SAS IA visual arts.
According to senior Anne kuo, the
chair of the group, at the time of Us origi
nation in 1997, there were no otliei t <mi-
ni 111 i i tv service organizations on campus
focused on the arts.
"Music and the arts have heen shown
to enhance intellectu.il development in
children, and these programs are often
non-existent or poorh funded in under

privileged school districts, Kuo said.
" I he founders, |Monica Klement (Class
<>l 1998) .ind Httany Kuo (Class of
1999)], felt that establishing such an or
ganization would have the potential of
impacting both children and Stanford
students alike."
Ac < ording to junior Mic h.iel Ross, one
of the program direc lot s for the music en
i it Innent program, the alliance was also
created so that volunteers could share

their love of music with othci s. I le said lie
joined because of his desire to integrate
music with service.
"Since I was not going to be a music
major and did not have much oppoi tuni
tv to plav the piano, I wanted to teac li it,"
Ross said. "[This program] was exacth
what I was looking for.
Another aim ol the alliance is to en
courage the growth <>l interest in the arts
throughout local communities.
"Our definitive goal is to build an al
liance of arts-focused community service
programs tli.it connect Stanford with the
local community in order to foster a c ulture
of arts appreciation and community advo
cacy," Kuo said.
(airrently, there are about 150 students
who have volunteered with the group, and
the group has extended to form partner
ships with art groups on campus, such as
Student Organizing Committee for the
Arts and Voting .it I feart.

"The p.ist two years I've taught an el
ementary school student, Matt, how to
play the piano," llsu said. "He's got a
great singing voice and .1 definite talent
for music, and as a part ot (the pro
gram], I'm glad I can help him express
that talent and encourage his interest,
lie gives me hugs when 1 show up Sat
urdav mornings."
Kuo alsc> said she has 11.1 cI meaningful ili
