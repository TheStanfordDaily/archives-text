Now is the time lor the I niversity to cement its
image and secure it lot the future.
I tifbt tunatelv, no one has stepped up. With a
new president, provost and vice provost of stu

must take the lead in organizing and strategi/-

ly outlined goals and plans to a< liieve them. I his

type of direction and initiative can only come
from a cohesive set of top administrators.
Already, our administration has frequently
shifted in its polities and practices — which is
fine, as long as there is some sort of continuity
and long-term planning holding the decision
making process together. Right now, it seems like
many changes are happening without much in
the way of cohesion or, at least, anv transparency.
()ne major consequente resulting fiom the lack
of stability is that certain ke\ institutions — like In
terdisciplinary Programs — receive little support
from the I niversity. I he I'niversity treats manv
programs, like American studies and Latin Ameri
can studies, differently from other fields, such as
histon or computer science. This might not hap
pen il a solid, consistent level of familiarity perme

several IDPs ma\ soon dissolve, many faculty and
students have become concerned about the direc-

Furthermore, on a personnel level, the fast
turnover rails into question how the University can at
n.u t facultx with .in administration in such a degree of
flux. I he swift shift in leadership with what appears to
be no effort to unifv and push a central focus can —
and to a certain extent has — created the appearance
of directionless I niversitv about which students and
faculty are confused and unhappy.
We relish the opportunity for the University
to have new leadership in its administrative posi
tions because the change brings with it the op
portunity to re-evaluate and reshape Stanford's
image and institutional direction. We also unde
rstand that it takes time for people to get com
fotable in their positions and with each other.
I lowever, the I niversitv should use the summer
months to get everyone on the same page and, in
doing so, develop a strategy to shape Stanford's
goals for the future.
