Internet liaisons often defy stereotypes
Alter reading the articlc on allege) at
tempts In Alexander Simon to sexualh as
sault .1 10-year-old girl. I was shocked.
What if I hi lilt her had n< >t stipei \ ised het
e-mailing? How main othei «hildren,
bovs .is well as girls, are possible victims
w hose parents do not read then e-mail?
Km the truth is that we .ill need to he
careful in our online relationships. Vic
tims do not need to he voting or female to
be lut ed into dangerous .h is online.
I he case ol Kern Kujawa sadl\ illus
ti.lies this point. Kujawa was .1 20-vear-old
male engineering student .11 I e\.is AXrM.
Kujawa did not lit any stcrcot\pcs about
.iss.uili \i( tuns: I le was not a child, he was
male and he was computer-savvy. I-.ist
yeai. he met .t young woman online In the
name ol Kelly Mc( lauley and beg.ui com
municating with her. I he online friend
ship went 011 lor several months. I Ins was
no set ret to his family and li iends — the\
all knew about Kelly. Kventually, Kujawa
planned a short trip to her house, to help
her out with some problems she had been
having with her boyfriend. However,
Kelly turned out to be a U1 -year-old man
named of Kenny Wayne l.ockwood. In
stead ol meeting with Kelly to help her
out, Kujawa was hrutallv murdered by
Kenny.
I he case involving Alexander Simon is
a bit diflerent. I he little girl knew him as <i
safety instrut tor from his s< liool, and nat
urally trusted him. But it may have been

due to the impersonal nature ol e-mail
thai Simon fell coniloi table enough to al
lude to sexual ac ts online that he never
might have mentioned in public. lau kilv,
the girl's lather was supervising her c
niails. but we must be aware that we are all
siisi eptible to dangerous deceptions in cv
berspac e.

Editorial 'fails to appreciate'
honors programs' flexibility
Yesterday's editorial ("Honors pro
grams inconsistent and unstructured")
f.iils to appreciate I niversity decisions
tli.it allow students topursuc rigorous aca
deniK projects in a flexible environment.
I he suggestion of the editorial to insti
tute mandatory thesis-related seminars
and communitv-huilding social events is
.111 unhealtln approach to promoting in
dependent, scholarly research. Instead,
we should applaud the I Jniversity for pro
viding support through voluntary initia
tives such as the I ndergraduate Research
()pportuniiics grants.
While I he Daily is well intcntioned in
wishing that students at this school find
support from advisers and University pro
grams to pursue their academic interests,
I am thankful to attend an institution th.it
leaves the responsibilities and challenges
of doing independent research on stu

dents' shoulders.
1 lie I niversiiN must make clear Ihe lo
klmi< s (, l proposing, developing and sub
mit ling an honors thesis, but it is the job of
the students to seek out support from col
leagues and collaborators with similar in
terests, find proofreaders and produce a
work tli.it will give back to the academic
<md soci.il community.
Ihe diversity in si rueJural support is to
be e\pc( led in a m hool that fosters such a
wide range of academic and inierdisci
plinan programs. I he diversity in moral
support is simpU .1 reflection on human
nature.

Film should not contrive Stanford
experience, but search it out on campus
List fall, a chagrined I niversity of
Wisconsin was forced to admit that a
cover booklet for ihe undergraduate
course catalogue had been "enhanced"
by Photoshopping the head of a black
student into .in all-white crowd scene at
<i football game. While the intentions of
ilie booklet developers were worthy
enough (highlighting diversity and tol
erance, m,iking everyone feel welcome
<iii(l soon—were worthy enough, the
use of a doctored photograph to
achieve these goals created an embar
fussing flap tor the university.
Stanford is currently involved in its
own campaign to showcase the under
graduate cause, and, .is 1 looked out the
window from Hen in Labs todav at a sec
ond and third take of a biology "experi

ment" being filmed outside—cue board
and .ill—l found Stanford's approach to
a promotional video equally curious. Its
not that 1 have a problem with raising
money tor undergraduate education or
trying to put Stanford's best foot for
ward. Both are worthy aims. 1 his is a
great place, and alumni should be
thankful tor having had the opportunity
to study here. What troubles me is that
the powers that be feel it's necessary to
hire an outside agency to stage a bunch

of over-the-top events fora video in the
hopes ol encouraging alumni to remem
ber the good old da\ sand reach for their
wallets. How hard would it have been
tor UW-Madison to find a few genuine
ly diverse interactions? Why can't Stan
ford commission undergraduate film
makers to scout out some of the excep
tional stories unfolding on this campus
every day?
What seems to be lost in this overly
expensive exercise in institutional self

promotion is the fact that a genuine
passion foi learning, tor being at Stan
ford—for teaching exceptional stu
dents and working with kick-ass I.uni
ty—isn't something that you can com
municate off of cue cards. I his Holly
wood-style production begs the ques
tion, why isn't the truth a sufficient
marketing angle for the Stanford brass?
Do we really need a presidential cam
paign-style film spot to stir the (Cardinal
spirit in alumni?

Looking out the window this quartet.
I've watched with .i certain amount ol
envv and nostalgia .is .i world-renowned
Stanford biology protessoi conducts .i
small-group undergraduate seminai
under the trees across from Hen in Labs.
Funny, it would make .1 nice scene in.i
video.
