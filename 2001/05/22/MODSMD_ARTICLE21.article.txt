Internet liaisons often defy stereotypes
Alter reading the articlc on allege) at
tempts In Alexander Simon to sexualh as
sault .1 10-year-old girl. I was shocked.
What if I hi lilt her had n< >t stipei \ ised het
e-mailing? How main othei «hildren,
bovs .is well as girls, are possible victims
w hose parents do not read then e-mail?
Km the truth is that we .ill need to he
careful in our online relationships. Vic
tims do not need to he voting or female to
be lut ed into dangerous .h is online.
I he case ol Kern Kujawa sadl\ illus
ti.lies this point. Kujawa was .1 20-vear-old
male engineering student .11 I e\.is AXrM.
Kujawa did not lit any stcrcot\pcs about
.iss.uili \i( tuns: I le was not a child, he was
male and he was computer-savvy. I-.ist
yeai. he met .t young woman online In the
name ol Kelly Mc( lauley and beg.ui com
municating with her. I he online friend
ship went 011 lor several months. I Ins was
no set ret to his family and li iends — the\
all knew about Kelly. Kventually, Kujawa
planned a short trip to her house, to help
her out with some problems she had been
having with her boyfriend. However,
Kelly turned out to be a U1 -year-old man
named of Kenny Wayne l.ockwood. In
stead ol meeting with Kelly to help her
out, Kujawa was hrutallv murdered by
Kenny.
I he case involving Alexander Simon is
a bit diflerent. I he little girl knew him as <i
safety instrut tor from his s< liool, and nat
urally trusted him. But it may have been

due to the impersonal nature ol e-mail
thai Simon fell coniloi table enough to al
lude to sexual ac ts online that he never
might have mentioned in public. lau kilv,
the girl's lather was supervising her c
niails. but we must be aware that we are all
siisi eptible to dangerous deceptions in cv
berspac e.

Editorial 'fails to appreciate'
honors programs' flexibility
Yesterday's editorial ("Honors pro
grams inconsistent and unstructured")
f.iils to appreciate I niversity decisions
tli.it allow students topursuc rigorous aca
deniK projects in a flexible environment.
I he suggestion of the editorial to insti
tute mandatory thesis-related seminars
and communitv-huilding social events is
.111 unhealtln approach to promoting in
dependent, scholarly research. Instead,
we should applaud the I Jniversity for pro
viding support through voluntary initia
tives such as the I ndergraduate Research
()pportuniiics grants.
While I he Daily is well intcntioned in
wishing that students at this school find
support from advisers and University pro
grams to pursue their academic interests,
I am thankful to attend an institution th.it
leaves the responsibilities and challenges
of doing independent research on stu

dents' shoulders.
1 lie I niversiiN must make clear Ihe lo
klmi< s (, l proposing, developing and sub
mit ling an honors thesis, but it is the job of
the students to seek out support from col
leagues and collaborators with similar in
terests, find proofreaders and produce a
work tli.it will give back to the academic
<md soci.il community.
Ihe diversity in si rueJural support is to
be e\pc( led in a m hool that fosters such a
wide range of academic and inierdisci
plinan programs. I he diversity in moral
support is simpU .1 reflection on human
nature.

Film should not contrive Stanford

List fall, a chagrined I niversity of
Wisconsin was forced to admit that a
cover booklet for ihe undergraduate
course catalogue had been "enhanced"
by Photoshopping the head of a black
student into .in all-white crowd scene at
