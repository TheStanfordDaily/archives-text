## 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AIM —
President Saddam Hussein yes
terday rejected a British propos
al to ease U.N. sanctions 011 Iraq,
saying the plan shows that the
embargo had failed.
The proposal, which is en
dorsed by the I nited States,
would mark the first significant
easing of the sanctions im
posed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990. I he U.N. Se
curity Council is likely to vote
on it later this week.
"We have nothing new to tell
our friends and brothers, except
that we are going i<> refuse what
is called the smart sanctions,"
Saddam said during a Cabinet
session in comments aired on
Iraqi TV.
Saddam said the proposal
represented a "declaration thai
the embargo imposed 011 Iraq
has failed to achieve its basic
goals."
The plan would allow Iraq to
import .ill kinds of goods, except
those on a U.N. list of military-re
lated items. It also would permit
commercial and cargo flights in
and out of Iraq as long as they are
inspected at their departure
points.
It also seeks to tighten border
controls around Iraq and to stop
Baghdad's efforts to gain con
trol of its oil revenues through
smuggling and illegal sur
charges.
I lie five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council sal
down yesterday for the first time
to discuss the British proposals.
Russia, China and France
have been Iraq's main support
ers on the 15-membcr Security
(ouncil, and their support is < 1 it -
ical to any overhaul of sanctions
because eac li lias veto power.

China has already indicated
there will be 110 quick approval of
the new plan. Chinese deputy
Ambassador Shen Cuofang said
his government needs more time
to study the highly technical list
of prohibited items.
Both British and U.S. diplo
mats have said the proposal
would likely be submitted to
the council later this week for
approval.
"We want to lessen the im
pact of sanctions 011 the civilian
economy and increase the focus
where it belongs, on the securi
ty issue and the arms control
part," said James (Cunningham,
acting U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations.
The goal of the proposed
measures is to ensure the sanc
tions don't hurt Iraqi citizens
while preventing Baghdad from
reviving its weapons-building
pr< (grams.
"In spite of the fact that the
embargo lias inflic ted harm on
Iraq, it made America lose a
significant part of its reputa
tion in the international
.11 ena," Saddam said.
"America has suffered a
strategic loss while our loss took
only the form of wounds and
bruises that could be considered
a sacrifice representing people's
honor."
Saddam insisted on total lift
ing of sanctions.
" 1 he natural solution for any
person who is rational, not evil,
and not moved by the Zionism, is
to lilt the sanctions in order to
consider his interests and to re
sped the will of the international
community," Saddam said. "Vet,
it seems that the U.S. administra
tions are tinder the control of the
Zionist circles.
