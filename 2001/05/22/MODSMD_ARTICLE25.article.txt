### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
ATHENS, (la. — Unfbrtunalely lor
Slanlbnl, the told curst- of irony struck at
the wrong time.
In one of the N( A\ men's tennis semi
finals last year, Tennessee dropped «i 4-3
hearthreaker to Virginia Commonwealth
when two of the Volunteers' players, Peter
Handoyo and Paul Podbury, succumbed
to severe cramping and retired.
Stanford, the winner of the other semi
final match, eventually rolled over Vir
ginia Commonwealth 4-0 in the finals.
Tennessee head coach Michael Fancutt
said he Ijelieved that his team should have
had the chance to play in the finals.
"We came so close last year that we lx
lieved we could have won the whole
thing," lie said.
This time around, it was the Cardinal
who It-ll victim to the Ceorgia heat as it
played without top-ranked senior Alex
Kim, who was suffering from .1 severe Ix >111
of dehydration. Kighth-seeded I enncssee
(22-5) took advantage of the absence of
Stanford's top player and denied the top
seeded Cardinal (24-2) a repeal NCAA
title by pulling off the biggest upset of the
tournament, 4-2, in the quarterfinals yes
terday in Athens, Ca.
"It was great match played by Ten
nessee." said Stanford head coach Dick
Could. "Mike [Tancutt] did a great job in

getting lus guys ready for singles, and 1
thought, in the top three matches, their
guys stayed in the points very well. It was a
tremendous < ompetitive eflort."
The Volunteers will move onto the
semifinals to face fifth-seeded Texas (chris
tian (24-3), which earlier defeated fourth
seeded Texas A&M (27-4).
"[Stanford] did not have probably the
Ix-st player in college tennis, [Kim], play
ing for them," Tancutt said. "However, 1
«un so proud < >112 my guys fora fantastic ef
fort. Nf\ guys have worked so hard and
have been so focused since probably this
time List year."
Kim (2(>-4) was forced to retire as a re
sult of t ramps in bis Round ol lf> singles
match against I'epperdine on Saturday
and was carried oil the court by his team
mates. Kim was taken to a local hospital
where he was diagnosed as suffering from
dehydration.
1 le remained in the hospital recovering
until yesterday morning and was unavail
able to play m the match against Ten
nessee. According to Could, Kim will
probably play 111 the individual tourna
ment, which starts on Thursday.
Ii was clear from the start of the Ten
nessee match tli.it 1 lit- Cardinal would
have to play its best tennis ol the year to ac
commodate the loss of Kim.
Even with the doubles lineup com
pletely switched up, Stanford actually
managed to grab the early I -0 lead by win

ning two out of the three doubles matches.
As a result of Kim's absence, his usual
doubles partner, junior K.J. Hippensteel,
paired with sophomore Ryan 1 laviland to
play No. 3 doubles against Simon Reaand
Nlatio Toledo.
The two, who have not played together
.til year, looked like a seasoned team as
they overwhelmed Rea and Toledo, 8-2.
While the No. 2 pair of 4 Ist-ranked se
niors Ali Ansari and Scottv Scott repeated
ly made uncharacteristic errors in an 8-2
loss to the 20th-ranked team ol Adam
(iarevand Mark Parsons, Stanford's No. 1
doubles team came through.
With the match between the 14th
ranked sophomore pair of David Martin
and Scott 1 jpsky and the 44th-ranked pair
of Andy (Irews and Peter I landovo tied at
six apiece and the Volunteers serving, I jp
sky hit an unlx'lievable backhand winner
down the line, stunning tlie Tennessee
pair and earning the break.
I his proved to be enough lor the (lar
dinal, as 1 jpsky finished the j< >1> b\ serving
out the match ai <S-f>.
1 o the dismay of Stanford fans, doubles
proved to be the only bright spot of the day
,is the ('.ardinal could not muster the same
ellort in singles play.
Ihe {)7th-ranked l.ipsky (21-4), who
has come through of late lor the (Cardinal,
stepped ii[) nicely into the No. 6 singles slot
