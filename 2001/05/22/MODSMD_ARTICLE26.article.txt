# Card grabs NCAA's fourth seed as Dirtbags roll into town
## Pac-10 places four teams in NCAA Tournament, Fullerton snags No. 1 seed 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter completing another enormous
ly successful regular season at the helm
of the Stanford baseball team, head
coach Mark Marquess received his re
ward yesterday: a No. I national seed iu
the 2001 NCAA Tournament and a
lout-team regional absent any other
team ranked in the most recent top-25
poll.
But lie's not exactly packing his bags
lor ()maha just yet.
Beginning Friday, the Cardinal (42-
14) will host Long Beach State, Texas
and Mai ist in a Ibur-leam, double-elim
ination regional at Sunken Diamond,
meaning three storied programs with a
combined 42 College World Series ap
pearances and a small college from New
York will meet to settle a trip to the
super regional round next weekend.
Though Long Beach State (35-21),
with lour trips to ()maha, and the Long
horns (34-24), with 28 CWS appear
ances, have not had excellent seasons by
their own standards, both teams pose se
rious threats to a Stanford team that

plays lour freshmen regularly.
"Will (the freshmen] play dillereni-
Iv?" Marquess asked. " I hey shouldn't,
but you don't know. I'm nervous be
cause they haven't been then- be lore.
But that's why we play the dillicult
schedule we do. I'm hoping that they
aren't Ireshmen anymore at this time of
the year."
Long Beach State and fexas both
know Sunken Diamond fairly well. 1 he
last time the Diribags — 1-ong Beach
Slate's sell-proclaimed baseball nick
name — earned a trip to Omaha, they
upset the Cardinal to win the Stanford
regional in 1008. fexas split a rain
shortened two-game series with the (lar
dinal al Sunken Diamond last year and
will bring many of the same fat es from
its 2000 (.WS team back to Palo Alto.
Marquess said he is familial both with
Long Beach States aggressive style
under head coach Dave Snow and with
Longhorn skipper Augie Carrido, for
merly ol Cal State-Fullerton, alter years
of battles oil I he West (.oast.
And as lor the unknown Maris! Red
Foxes?
"Maris! scares me because you don't
know anything about them," Mar
quess said. "No matter who you are or
what conference you're in. if you are in
the postseason, you are playing well
right now."
I he Red foxes (.32-10-1), the Iburth

seed m the regional behind the No. 2
Diribagsand No. 3 Texas, make the trek
from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., alter winning
the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conlerence
tournament over the weekend.
Should the Cardinal advance out ol
its regional, it would most likely host a
super regional the following weekend.
I he sites for the second weekend of
postseason action will be determined
following tlu- completion of all regional
play, but a brand-new facility and a No.
•1 national seed should give Stanford
the- chance to remain at home lot an
other round.
I he- winner ol the Stanford regional
will face the regional champion from
Columbia, S C., where Central Florida
and South Carolina nabbed the top
two seeds.
Nationalh. the Southeastern ('.onler
ence chew a record eight of the- f>4 tour
nament bids, led b\ Georgia and last
year's national champion, Louisiana
State. Ihe Big 12 was next, with live
teams in the tournament, and the Pacif
ic 10 Conference put four teams in the
N( A A field.
Ihe selection committee awarded
Southern California a regional in Los
Angeles and a No. 3 national seed,
while ihe California Golden Bears
head to Baton Rouge as the third seed
