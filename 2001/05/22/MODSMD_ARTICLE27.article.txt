been nice. A conference title? Even better.

back in form. I he Cardinal finished the reg
ular season one game Iwhind No. 2 Southern
(California in the conference standings, falling
just short of capturing at least a share of its
fifth consei utive conference championship.
"Sure, we would have liked to win a l'ac-10
title," said head coach Mark Marquess. "But
the most im|x>rtant thing is that we are playing
good baseball heading into post!reason."
Knowing its chances of a league title were
slim coming into the Washington State series.

In the eighth inning, junior Arik Van-
Zandt and sophomore Ryan (iarko delivered

the last ol the six Stanford bombs, bringing
