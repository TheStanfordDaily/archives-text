### BRIAN DECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One year ago, a previously undefeated Stan
ford squad was disappointed in a 4-2 upset at the
hands ol 'Georgia in the NCAA women's tennis
national championship match. One year ago,
Stanford's women's tennis head coach Lele
Forood was wrapping up her 1 Ith year as assis
tant coach to the legendary Frank Brennan. ()ne
year ago, Laura Granville was ranked a mere
No. in the nation, without even an NCAA Sin
gles (Championship under her belt.
What a difference a year makes.
Yesterday, the Cardinal (30-0), led by the un
precedented success of 2000 NCAA Champion
Laura (iranville, capped off an undefeated season
with a national c hampionship, Stanford's first of
the year. Stanford earned its 1 ltli NCAA women's
tennis title by shutting out the up-and-coming
Vanderbilt Commodores (2f>-5), 4-0. at the Lin
coln Tennis (-enter in Stone Mountain, (ia.
The title match, postponed until yesterday
after heavy rains, was a solid win for the Cardi
nal and an appropriate conclusion to the team's
impressive season.
l lie top-ranked doubles tandem of junior Lau
ren kalvaria and freshman Lauren Barnikow
overcame Vanderbilt's Jenny Miller and Kelly
Schrnandt, 8-0, while the nation's second-ranked
team, sophomore Granville and junior Gabriela
Lastra. knocked oil the 17th-ranked pair of Sarah
Riske and Aleke Fsoubanos, H-4. Ihe two best
doubles teams in the country ensured a point for
Stanford in each of the tournament's six iratnes.

"Our team was amazing this
year." Forood said. "Hack in the
fall, I could not foresee .111 unde
feated season. Ihe fact that we
were able to go undefeated in the
P.h -10 is a huge accomplishment.
We came into this tournament
with a mission and were able to
keep our focus and take tare of
business. I really am in awe of how
we performed that last rouple of
days, when vou take into account
the weathei and the delavs. It's .1
gi eat leeling."
