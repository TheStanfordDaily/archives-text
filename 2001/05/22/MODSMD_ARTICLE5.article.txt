### NICK CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Out <>l IN7 applicants, 30 professors and graduate
students have l)een named Stanford I lumanities ( '.en
ters fellows for the 2001-2002 year.
As fellows, these 30 scholars will spend the year re
searching and collaborating, while also giving back to
the Stanford community by teaching lectures, ai tending
workshops and hosting conferences. The fellows come
from almost every field of the humanities. 1 his year, a
relatively large number of the fellows' loc us is on music.
Another new development is the Roc kefeller Fellow
ships in Black Performing Arts. I his year s recipients,
Louise Meintes and Sandra Richards, are the first two
fellows in this program and will be- followed by two mot e
pairs in the next two years.
External Fellows from outside of Stanford, Faculty
Fellows from the current Stanford fiu ult\, (iaballe I )is

scrtation Fellows, who are preparing to write t licit grad
uate theses, and Pre-Doctoral Fellows, who are a few
years younger than the (iaballe 112 ellows, make up the
remaining 2N people.
As honors fellows, the scholars will spend a vear
working at Stanford's I lumanities ('.enter, which will l>e
moving to the Bowman ('.enter.
Although .ill the fellows spend the yeai stud) mg and
researching on their own projec ts, much of then lime
will be spent working together, sharing and debating
different ideas.
"I'm looking forward to interac ting with my soon-to
l)e colleagues and having long stretches of time to do
reading and reseat (h." Politic al Science Prof, and Stan
ford Faculty Fellow Rob Reich said, adding that lie
hasn't had much time to do either recently. Most of
Reich's research will be fora new lx>ok he is writing on
the conflicts surrounding children
in <i liberal political state.
Mia hnii li.a second-year gradu
ate student in history, will use the
ve.u as an Honors Fellow to Ix'gin
preparing fbi her graduate thesis.
Because graduate students usually
don't Ix-gin planning their disserta
tions until their third vcar, Bruch
said she will use the year to further
explore her chosen topic of history.
Over the summer, she said she
plans to do research in New York.
She said she is very excited about the
mam opportunities at the ('-enter

for the Humanities.
"Writing or preparing fora dis
sertation takes time and spate,"
Bruch said. "There's no way in
whit li the Humanities (.enter gives
me mot e time, hut what it does give
me is physical and intellectu.il space,
where not only will I have an office
space, but I'll constantly Ik- actively
engaged with other people in fur
thering that project."
Bruch also mentioned the inter
disciplinary nature of the program,
which she experienced as a Modern
Thought and Literature major, but
which she said she now feels she is
missing because she has committed
to the subject of history.
Each of the fellows underwent

a rigorous application process in
order to Ik* chosen. All appli
cants, including professors, had
to obtain a recommendation.
F.ach person also had to write a
proposal describing his or her
planned research.
"It required that you provide
them with enough background to
situate yourself in tlu- field and then
give a sense of where your interests
are headed," Bruc h said.
Previous fellows in the- humani
ties have come from schools as
close as UC-Berkeley or as far
away as Australia and have cov
ered topics ranging from "Ameri
can (iothic Visual Culture" to
"Bible Lessons for Kings."
