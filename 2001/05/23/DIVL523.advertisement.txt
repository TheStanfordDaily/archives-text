David Pan
Join us as author David Pan discusses his first book, Primitive Renaissance. This book argues that the
raduality of early-twentieth century movements, such as German expressionism, was actually a
shift towards primitivism rather than modernism and that at the heart of these works was a critique
o! modernity through a primitivist aesthetic that priviligcd art over science and reason.
Ranging insightfully across the visual arts, literature and philosophy, Primitive Renaissance offers
a provocative reassessment of the significance of primitivism and its contribution to the intellectual,
artistic and cultural climate of Europe in the early twentieth century.
