()n M.tv L\'i, l ( .)(i(). The f)ail\ printed an article
about CIV.
"Whether thev s.iv I love it!' or 'It's torture!' most
students feel ( \ V can be improved.
"I irslunan |im McNish suggested changing the
com se into an introducton humanities or social sci
ence course for phvsical s< ience majors, with social
s( ience and humanities students being offered 'a dif
ferent course oriented toward their interests.'
Tl\ instructor Jacqueline Strain noted that
there is 'too much overlap' between ('.IV and cours
es su< h as the I luinanilies fi() series, beginning cours
es in social st iences and freshman English.
I he complaint was 'not that these programs are
bad. it just seems unfair; some super (llV'classes, es
pe< iallv, involve mu< h more work than others.' "
Bottom line: We gripe about l-Hum, but it sure seems to be
an improvement over CIV.
