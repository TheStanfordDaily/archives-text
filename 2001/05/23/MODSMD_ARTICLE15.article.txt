### DURANT GIPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent study by Stanford re
searcher Keith Humphreys con
cluded that 12-step-orientcd pro
grams for substance abuse em
phasizing spirituality and faith
are more effective in promoting
abstinence than programs th.it
simply f<K us on coping skills.
Ihe study, titled "( '.an En
couraging Substance Abuse- Pa
tients to Participate in Self-Help
Croups Reduce Demand for
Health Care? A Quasi-Experi
mental Study," appears in the
May issue of "Alcoholism: Clini
cal .md Experimental Rcseart h."
"(iroups like Alcoholic s Anony
mous and Narcotics Anonymous
are taking a huge burden off of the
health care system," said
Humphreys, who is the lead au
thor of the study and a professoi in
the Department of' Psychiatry and
behavioral Sciences in the Stan
ford Medical School.
"\\'e found that addiction
treatment programs are more ef
fective and less expensive when
they link patients to spirituality
based self-help groups,"
Humphreys said.

The study also observed that
the 12-step-oriented programs
were not only more cost-efficient,
but also more effective in keep
ing the men substance-free.
The research team followed
1,774 low-income substance-de
pendent men who had been en
rolled in programs at 10 Depart
ment of Veterans Affairs medical
centers around the country.
Of the men in the self-help
oriented programs, nearly 4b
percent were still abstinent a year
later, compared with 8b percent
of men in the cognitive-behav
ioral programs.
11 alt of the men were in one of
the five programs that empha
sized the 12-step approach asso
ciated with programs like Alco
holics Anonymous. I lie other
half <>1 the men were enrolled in
medical cognit ive-behavioi a I
programs that teach methods to
avoid relapse.
I lie men from the two differ
ent groups were placed in pro
grams based on their costs of men
ial health care in the year preced
ing treatment. Humphreys then
used these groups lo assert that
men enrolled in the cognitive-be
havioral programs had costs in

the year after tlist barge that were
about $4,700 higher than the men
in the self-help group.
"These types of programs are
really worth supporting,"
I lumplueys said.
According to Humphreys's
study, managed care companies
have been pressuring mental
health professionals to reduce
costs, but, because of ethic al con
cerns, clinicians don't wish to
compromise health in the inter
est of reduc ing costs.
I lie study's introduction savs.
"One clinical practice that max
help reconcile the frequentl\
conflicting goals of cost contain
ment and good outcome is lo
promote involvement in cost
free self-help groups."
"It would lie a good thing to have
health aire link to tfiese self-help
groups," Humphreys said. "We
would make back our investment."
I'lie study was timded In the
