A theati ii al adaptation of a Mary Shelley novel. .111
analysis of the economics of dancers' salaries and a
study of the ethnohotanv of the karok are among the
diverse projects that will be funded by this year's Un
dergraduate Research Opportunities grants. Suc
cessful applicants for the grants received the good
news b\ e-mail late Frida\ evening.
I his quarter, the I RO oflice received a total of
192 applit at ions for major grants, which provide up
to ()()() and at e offered onlv once .1 year. A further
94 applications were received for small grants, which

ter. (>ne hundred and fifty major grants and (>9 small
grants were awarded on Friday, for a total of
$4'12,S"»r». A further '28 applications have been
placed 011 hold, pending the receipt of additional
material from students.
" I he research grant proposals are not so much
about bureaucrats .is they are about really having
the students sit down and conceptualize what is it
that tlie\ want to learn about, how are they going to
go about doing that, what are the steps and what are
thecosts," said FRO Diiectoi Fa lira Sel/nick. "If you
do that well, vour chances are about HO percent of
getting funded."
Freshman grant recipient Kristy Wu echoed
Sel/nick's sentiment. " I lie pnxess forces you to plan
out voui projec t in detail, like .111 outline for a paper,
so in the long run things run more smoothly." she said.
While all undergi aduates are eligible to appl\ for
small grants, major grants are normally awarded
onlv to juniors planning to complete an honors the
sis. Wu is among the few who have succeeded in
breaking this norm.
"I didn't know that it was a major thing lot a fresh
man to propose a grant," Wu s.iic 1. "All I knew was
tli.it I wanted to do this project, and proposing a
I R() grant seemed like the rijjlit venue."
\\ u s projc< t, a stage adaptation of Mary Shellev's
novel "Mathilda." was inspired In her acting cxperi
eii( e .ind b\ a seminal she took that lot used on Sliel

ley's writing.
"Shelley actually wrote a monstrous amount ol
work that no one has ever heard ot. and that li.is
strangely not been published until IWf> 01 ( .>7. li
seemed a huge mvstery to me," Wu said.
Wu's research will uikc her to Scotland, Kngl.md
and New York this summer, and she- will spend the
next academic vear writing the pla\
|unioi |ohn W'infield will also be travelling to New
York to research his project, "Kconoinic s of the Ait v
A Case Study in Ballet."
W'infield, who is majoring in economics and ini
noring in plnsic s, wasa professional ballet dancci foi
seven vears before transferring to Stanford this \e.n
"Mv research conies from wanting to explore
some ol the reasons whv dancers are paid su< li low
salaries." W'infield said. "One of ni\ theories is that
dancers trade ot! a higher sal.in for dancing with
other high (|iulii\ dancers because so muc li ol the art
is realh about who vou're danc ing with, who \ou re
danc ing next to," he said. "I'm going to look at .1 sur
vev of salaries from contracts at the ballet union
headquarters ill New YOlk to see if there is evident e
for this."
W'infield s.iid he tell that the I RO program li.id
made his classes at Stanford more meaningful.
" The econometrics c lass I'm taking 1 ight now is a
completely different experience because I'm think
ing the whole time that 1 have this problem that 1
need to solve and I'm in this class to learn how to
solve it."he said. "It makes a world of difference
when you have .1 spec ific problem."
1 his was one ol the main purposes fit>l the I R( >
program, .ic cording to Scl/nic k.
"There's this whole strand of being sure that
your education has meaning to von and vou're not
just satisfying a whole bunch ol requirements."
Scl/nic k said.
"1 think the best advice that I can offer to .iiiv stu
dent is that iliev should find something that thev're
reallv interested in knowing more about and find a
wav to weave that into their education."
|unior C'.elina l)e Leon, a hum.in biolog\ majoi
who will research the medicinal use ol plants l>\ (,al
ifbrnia's Karok tribe, said her t l\<) gr.mt would
allow her to clo just th.it.
"Medical cthnobotany has been in\ passion .is
long as I c an remember," l)e Leon said.

dergraduate Research.
" 1 he work that I did as an un
dergraduate isven much related
to the work that I pursued in
graduate school and that I am cm -
rently conducting," I sai said. "It
was a wonderful opportunity to
learn about the giant writing
process and the nuts and holts ol
conducting research, to work
c losely with a laculh memhei and
to learn more about statistical
analysis and data interpielation,"
"Laura Sel/nick runs a great
program and is \ci \ supportiveol
undergraduates. I couldn't be
lieve that she remembered me
alter 10 years," I sai added.
Sel/nick, who last veai won a
Dinkelspiel Award lor distinctive
contributions to undergraduate
education, stressed the individual
attention students receive at the
l R() office.
"It'sabout the individual things
that happen working with the in
dividual students," slu- s.iid.
She urged students lii st to visit
