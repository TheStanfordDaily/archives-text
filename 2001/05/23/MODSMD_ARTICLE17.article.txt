congratulate the conlerence planners for the
bold step nl organizing this conlerence and for
bi inging ,i professional level ol academic shar

I he conference, which attracted under
graduate students from 27 schools in six
si.lies .iiid four countries, provides a much
needed opportunitN for manv undergradu
ates to show oil tlieii academic research and

their department's commitment to sharing
the work that they do. A conlerence lor grad
uate students in the I'hilosophv Department
earlier this month also provided similar ben
efits to philosophy graduate students
throughout the state. (onferences like these
send a strong message to the community:
Stanford students aren't just working hard in
their research, they are also ( reating oppor
tunities to share their researc li with others in
a verv professional wav.
I lie undergraduate communitv, with f.u ni
ts support, has long been working lor ad
vances in manv fields, and these conferences
provide an environment in wliic h undergrad
uates can present their own work to an admir
ing and interested public . I he psvc hology con
lerence alone brought more than 200 students
and facultv. Bringing this level ol academic
locus is important to show facultv, stall and

graduate students the research contributions
<>l undergraduates.
I he academic environment of the confer
ence also provides a c hance ibr feedback and
collaboration among students — both under
graduate and graduate — that probably would
not happen otherwise.
And iht- psychology conference had more
than just an academic focus; education and
oulreac h were also built into the program. The
proceeds from the conference were donated to
,i South San Francisco high school in order to
update 20-vear-old psychology textbooks.
I his additional outreach is just one of the
added benefits of a student-run conference.
Furthermore, the successful execution of
the conference gives testament to the efficacy
ol undergraduate leadership on campus. The
conference was well organized and well run,
right down to its Web site with helpful in for-

mation for prospective presenters. Ihe stu
dent organizers likely had dozens ol other
things to worry about .it this busy time of year,
but they planned a large-scale conference with
confidence.
Congratulations to the students who
worked so hard to make this and other student
conferences a success this year. Bv demonstrat
ing their determiniation, these students set a
clear precedent for the upcoming vcar. Stan
lord is a research university, and many stu
dents here are involved in meaningful and fas
cinating projects. We encourage students in
other departments to consider hosting re
search and conferences in the future. Such
conferences not only provide benefits to the
student presenters and the audeince, but also
to Stanford as a whole — which is something
tli.it truly speaks to the power and promise of
all of our students.
