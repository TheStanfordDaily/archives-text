\s.i resident assistant in a freshman dot in
of students, I began the vear thinking
things would be fairly tough without the
usual smattei ing of freshmen with < ars.
I was right — it was extremely diflu 11It to
help them bin st the Stanford Hubble.
I .ike these tangible examples, it was im

I doubt it.
\nd has anyone thought of the following

huge majority of next year's ear-starved
sophomore class will bring automobiles to
campus. II freshmen that are denied tars

situation be even worse?
Not that anyone noticed, but F.nterprise

tultilled promises. It's a nice gesture. Hut this
Hand-Aitl solution will iiliiinateh fail. It will
follow initiatives like the "( at\ Ixprcss Shut

offit ials like to spew; I see the evidente first

Will things change? \s long as adminis
trators believe freshmen are the "least 1111-
pacted" and most easih nianipulated group
oil this campus, the future I see isn't so
hiiglit. Imagine this:
Max 23, 2005
s I ANKORD — I lie Stanford Marguerite
shuttle service will soon expand its < overage
to include Yosemite National Park, I niver
sit\ ollit ials announced at a small reception
vestertl.i\ afternoon.
I he "Y osemite Kxpress" shuttle, which
begins running in earlv 2005, will transport
Stanford students, free of charge, to and
Irom Yosemite Valley. I lie decision to add
Yosemite to the Marguerite's service area
was implemented as the result of a vcar-long
ASSI survcN which identified the most pop
ular travel destinations stranded students
sought to \isit. Following the freshman car
ban in 2000, the I niversitv extended the
ban to all undergraduates in 2003.
Details are still pending, but a projected
schedule shows that two shuttles will leave
from the I residder |).u king lot even Frida\
at noon, arriving in Yosemite sometime on
Saturday.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mart
Wais applauded the Dean of Students ()llite
for its decision to make Yosemite accessible
to students.
The 'Yosemite Kxpress' is yet another
milestone that the Dean of Students Office
and the Parking and 'Transportation Office
have reached together to benefit Stanford
students," he said. "The ASSI told us what
the students wanted, and we responded.
Yosemite, tiuit h like I .ake I ahoe last year, is
now within reach."
Senior Sally (ireen was thrilled by the an
nouncement.
"One of the reasons I tame to Stanford
was bee ause of its ama/ing location." she
said. I remember the admissions booklet
was tilled with these wonderful pictures of
people doing things .ill over the area, in
t hiding trips to Yosemite. Now I can finally
get there with the help of the Marguerite."

Josh Fried, a senior ma faring in comparative liter
(ithit. will be making a C.ostco run tomorrow or
hridfiy. If you are earless an/I would like to bum a
ride, e-mail him at if rvdia stanforil.edu.
