University does not need
just 'one direction'
I would like to take issue with yesterday's
editorial lamenting the "indecisiveand inco
hesive" administration of this university,
("Unstable administration demands direc
tion." ) which asserts that the administration
is in some sort of undesirable state of "flux."
I spent last summer working in the bureau
cracy of another university, and I know your
critic ism is misguided.
First, a university should always be
c hanging; it should examine its strengths

and weaknesses and redefine its structure
and offerings to try to better itself. I his pro
fess is rarely invisible. ()f late, we have seen
the I niversity working to these ends, and it
appears to he self-critical and rclativch
forthright. Would \on rather Stanford he
statu and complacent?
Second, and this point I must credit to
I niversity President Emeritus Gerhard
C.asper, who visited in\ dormitorv several
weeks ago, Ihe I ).iil\ s use ol the word "ad
ministration is dubious and unspec iti<. Ihe
administration, as the editorial suggests,
sounds like some sort of mysterious, iron
listed agency, potentially capable of plotting
and executing just about any thing. It sounds
like something along the lines ol the Nation
al Security Agency or the upper manage
ment of a privately-held company. I'his is far
from the truth. It is a decidedly political en
tity, comprised of a variety of executives and
legislative bodies. I here are certainly dis
agreements and competing agendas, but
this is a part of the process, lo top it oil. the
administration must handle a myriad of
constituencies: faculty, students, alumni,
donors, neighboring communities, and the
list goes on. Who can blame the I niversity s
leaders for being .1 tad "incohesive"?
Finally, Stanford does not need to find
one iustitution.il direction —it has many
directions. Stanford, as a large, multi
faceted research university, has seemingly
endless programs, goals and missions. By
using the singular. I he Daily oversimplifies
the issues at hand.
