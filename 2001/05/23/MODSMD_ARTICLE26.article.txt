### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Freshman (.arlos Quentin never re.il
ly wanted to be No. 24.
He knew exactly what that number
meant.
"When 1 was assigned that number, I
thought to tnvsell. I don't want to have
to till |oe lion hard's shoes,' Quentin
said.
I nderslandablv, the lasi thing the
incoming rightfielder needed was
people comparing him to Borchard,
the outgoing rightfieldei with a multi
million-dollar contract who had hit 10
career home runs and who had led
Stanford to two consecutive College
World Series.
For Quentin, then, the plan was sim
ple: Find the person who had his lugli
school nuinbei. No. 1. and trade.
Brave Jonn\ Ash, though, the small
est freshman on the team, refused trad
ing with the (>-foot-2, 210-pound
Quentin.
"lie was a bit intimidating, hut I
thought he was joking around. I didn't re
alize how serious lu- was at In st," Ash said.
Aftet davs ol Quentin's continuous
pestering. Ash linall\ gave- in. But In
ih.it lime, it was past the lostei deadline.
Quentin was iherefbi e sun k with Bor
( hard's number, and the ex pec tations.
1 alk about living up to those
prospects, lu his one veai with the (Car
dinal, Quentin has not onl\ made his
way into the starting lineup, bui he has

also led Stanford in home runs (11) and
is sec ond on the squad in RBI, total bases
and slugging percentage.
On Mondav, Pacific 10 Conference
Commissioner loin Hansen named
Quentin the Pac-10 Freshman Baseball
Player of the N ear.
I le s perlot med as well .is any fresh
man we've ever had here, and that
speaks volumes for what kind of year
he's had," s.ud head coach Mark Mar
quess, who had enough faith in starting
Quentin in ilic cleanup position when
sophomore |ason Cooper was hurt ear
lier in the Near.
"lot a freshman to hit three or four,
that's unbelievable pressure, and he re
sponded well to it," Marquess said.
Quentin's solid offensive and defen
sive presence lias assuredly helped him
at tain his goal of "being his own player
and person."
And il Stanford baseball fans still want
to make those comparisons to Borchard,
ihev'd find statistics that speak for
themselves. Quentin has put up better
numbers than the Chicago White Sox

hits, home runs and runs scored. Fur

Not bad lot a plaver who had a tough
lime adjusting to college baseball.
Quentin admitted that lie had been a bit
overw helmed during intra-squad scrim
mages in the lall. "It was tough
because we have some lough pitc hers,
and I fell tenible swinging the bat,"
Quentin said.
I he adversiiN Quentin faced was not
limited to the field. Freshman Brian
Hall, who plavcd with Quentin on the
junior national team in Taiwan two

years ago, said thai both of them tell un
easy at tfie beginning of the vear.
"We didn't know what t lasses we were
taking, and we didn't know where to
start," Hall said. "I remember one da\
we were walking out of Jamba Jui< e and
we started flipping out. wondering wh.it
we were doing here. We kind of felt like
we didn't belong."

freshmen Sam Fuld and Vsh, along with
the help of some of the veteran plavcts
and coaches, both players began i< > settle

Fast-forward to Quentin's litst colle
giate at-bat in January, and no one
would have ever guessed that the fresh
man had ever had problems.
In Stanford's second game of the sea
son on Jan. 2b against Fresno State,
Quentin got his shot, batting in the
nine-spot, the freshman from ( hula
Vista stepped up to the plate fbi the lit si
time and blasted a three-run home run
to left field that ricocheted oil ol the
Pepsi sign on the scoreboard.
"I just put a good swing on it and
lucky," Quentin said. "It felt so gnat oil
the bat. It felt good to show a little
power."
I he only tiling missing at that magi
