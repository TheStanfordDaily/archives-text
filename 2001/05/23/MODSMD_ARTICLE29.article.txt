### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sophomore poller Kim Rowton knows it's ili.il
time of year.
"It really matters right now," Rowton said.
She can say that again.
Ihe No. 3 Cardinal has been in Mowey-in-the
i I ills. I la., since Saturday gearing up lor the NCAA
Women's (ioll (lhampionships, whit li end on Friday.
Iwenty-lour of the nation's top SO teams will contend
lor the national title on the f>, 106-yard, par-72 I I
(lampeon (ionise at the Mission 11111 (ioll and I ennis
Resort.
Don't think that the Cardinal won't be ready.
" I his has been the goal of the entire year," head
coach Caroline O'Connor said. "We ate .is prepared
as we have to Ik-.''
()r as prepared as they can be. lor that matter. Most
of the players competing this week have Ix'en out ol
s< hool lot the last couple of weeks, devoting all of their
time to being on the driving range and course. I he
Cardinal squad, however, lias had to lit practices in
between midterms and (lasses, whit li could pi it them
at a bit of a disadvantage.
Any handicap, though, wouldn't be anything new
to Rowton, as she seems to finally be on top of het
game after a year ol battling back from surgery. Row
ton, who had an operation 011 her right knee last miiii
mer, struggled at times throughout the season, but in
now primed to help lead the Cardinal to a national
championship. Rowton was Stanford's highest finish
er in the West Regional 111 ('.orvallis, ()re., two weeks
ago, plac ing filth among 105 competitors.
"It's nice for me to be playing well at this time ol
year,' Rowton said. "My finish two weeks ago is .1 huge
motivating factor going into this week."
Rowton isn't the only one with some sort of moti
vation. The prospect of beating top-ranked Duke or
No. 2 Arizona is enough to spur the other Cardinal
competitors on. Stanford has not beaten Ik)|li teams 111
the same event, although it did top I )uke in I u< son in
February.
Furthermore, the Cardinal has placed second to
the Wildcats in its past two tournaments — the
Pacific 10 Championships and the West Regionals.
Arizona has won live tournaments this year, while
Stanford has onl\ one title, which it won at the IVg

Seniors Hilary Honieyer and

With Honieyer and Keever leav

the best chance the Cardinal will
have to win a national title in a

So, the stage is set. Time for
Rowton to take charge.

Sophomore Kim Rowton putts earlier this year. Rowton arid the No. 3 Cardinal are currently in
Florida for the NCAA Championships, which will end on Friday
Kn n.ird California Collegiate at

"Too manv people focus 011

she said.

II we take each da\ as it it's the

good numbers early on, I think we
can win it. Rowton said.
A major diHcrcncc this week is
that .ill teams will pla\ four rather

Stanford. I he ( aidinal holds the

nation's best average final-round

course conditions.
I lie longer the tournament,
the better we plav," ()'(Ion nor s.iid.
AVe're much more consistent than
.1 lot of teams out there, and I like
our chances."
O'Connor said she also thinks
that Stanford has the best all
around team because, unlike most
other teams, any of the five golfers
on the team lias the capability of
winning the individual title.
Seniors Hilary Honieyer and
Stephanie Keever will be plaving
their final collegiate event this
week, while freshmen Angela
RIIO and Kim Kouwabunpat w ill
get their first taste of NCAAs.
With Honieyer and Keever leav
ing after this year, this might be
the best chance the Cardinal will
have to win a national title in a
while.
So, the stage is set. Time for
Rowton to take charge.
And for Honieyer, Keever,
Kouwabunpat and Rho to do so as
well.
