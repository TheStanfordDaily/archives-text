Sophomore poller Kim Rowton knows it's ili.il
time of year.
"It really matters right now," Rowton said.
She can say that again.
Ihe No. 3 Cardinal has been in Mowey-in-the
i I ills. I la., since Saturday gearing up lor the NCAA
Women's (ioll (lhampionships, whit li end on Friday.
Iwenty-lour of the nation's top SO teams will contend
lor the national title on the f>, 106-yard, par-72 I I
(lampeon (ionise at the Mission 11111 (ioll and I ennis
Resort.
Don't think that the Cardinal won't be ready.
" I his has been the goal of the entire year," head
coach Caroline O'Connor said. "We ate .is prepared
as we have to Ik-.''
()r as prepared as they can be. lor that matter. Most
of the players competing this week have Ix'en out ol
s< hool lot the last couple of weeks, devoting all of their
time to being on the driving range and course. I he
Cardinal squad, however, lias had to lit practices in
between midterms and (lasses, whit li could pi it them
at a bit of a disadvantage.
Any handicap, though, wouldn't be anything new
to Rowton, as she seems to finally be on top of het
game after a year ol battling back from surgery. Row
ton, who had an operation 011 her right knee last miiii
mer, struggled at times throughout the season, but in
now primed to help lead the Cardinal to a national
championship. Rowton was Stanford's highest finish
er in the West Regional 111 ('.orvallis, ()re., two weeks
ago, plac ing filth among 105 competitors.
"It's nice for me to be playing well at this time ol
year,' Rowton said. "My finish two weeks ago is .1 huge
motivating factor going into this week."
Rowton isn't the only one with some sort of moti
vation. The prospect of beating top-ranked Duke or
No. 2 Arizona is enough to spur the other Cardinal
competitors on. Stanford has not beaten Ik)|li teams 111
the same event, although it did top I )uke in I u< son in
February.
Furthermore, the Cardinal has placed second to
the Wildcats in its past two tournaments â€” the
Pacific 10 Championships and the West Regionals.
Arizona has won live tournaments this year, while
Stanford has onl\ one title, which it won at the IVg
