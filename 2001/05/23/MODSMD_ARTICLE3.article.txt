Asol Monday. Simon's status as a stu
dent has heen put on administrative

the I niversitv," Zumwalt s.ud.
I .ast week. Simon's < ase was brought

Office. Judicial officers will gather in
formation and meet with Simon to de

termine if a heating is necessary. 11 a
hearing is held. Simon and the com

nity to present their c ases.
I he administrative hold is "com
pletely separate from 11is judicial sta
tus."' Zuinxvalt said. "It's something the
I Diversity is entitled to pin in place il
its in the best interest of the I niversitv
and the community to do that."
Stanford's judic lal hearing is also in
dependent from the criminal process,
although the timeline ol the trial will
possibly affect Stanford's judicial
process because it requires the student
to be present to stale his case.
According to Zumwalt, il Simon re
quested more time to prepare Ins case
because ol the ci itninal process. the in
die ial board would grant him that time.

which runs the Salet\ Sense program,
released .i statement vesterda\ outlin

I he statement says that, once hospi
tal oHi< ials leal ned of Simon's e-mail to
the girl and the police investigation,
they fired Simon from the volunteer

the volnnteei code of conduct honored
In volunteers asso< iated with onr hospi
tal." the statement said. "All volunteers

reference checks and training.
We are not aware of any informa

that would have alerted anyone
to the potential for this kind
of problem."
According to the hospital's

unteer at Packard Hospital in
1997, but the hospital stall has 110

evidence of inappropriate behav
