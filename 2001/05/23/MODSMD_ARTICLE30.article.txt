Some legends we just can t shake because

I never knew Steve Prefbntaine. I never
saw him run. I don't feel close to him or
think 1 understand him. It's more impor
tant to me to trv to understand what he
means to so many other people. I le let peo
ple — "my people," as he called the resi
dents of Kugene — believe in him, and he
believed in them enough to mentor pris
oners and talk to schoolchildren and lobby
the l it\ for better running trails.
I don't think that people celebrate
Steve Prefbntaine on May 30 because he
was a great runner. There have been
main great runners whose names appear
only on trophies and record lists. People
celebrate Steve Prefbntaine for the same
reason they love llayward Field — be
cause, on anv evening, they can go out and
run on the same tr.u k that Marion (ones
flew in to compete on.

means to so many other people. I le let peo

believed in them enough to mentor pris

I don't think that people celebrate
Steve Prefbntaine on May 30 because he
was a great runner. There have been

I never knew Steve Prefbntaine. I never
saw him run. I don't feel close to him or
think 1 understand him. It's more impor
tant to me to trv to understand what he
means to so many other people. I le let peo
ple — "my people," as he called the resi
dents of Kugene — believe in him, and he
believed in them enough to mentor pris
oners and talk to schoolchildren and lobby
the l it\ for better running trails.
I don't think that people celebrate
Steve Prefbntaine on May 30 because he
was a great runner. There have been
main great runners whose names appear
only on trophies and record lists. People
celebrate Steve Prefbntaine for the same
reason they love llayward Field — be
cause, on anv evening, they can go out and
run on the same tr.u k that Marion (ones
flew in to compete on.
