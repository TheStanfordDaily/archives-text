# a 						weekly look at science and technology at stanford Innovation
## Graduate student visits Hewlett-Packard's lab of the future 
### NATHAN EAGLE 
Computers today arc at an embryonic
stage of development, but we have been
taught to accept their limitations. We have
allowed the gross misuse of the term "user
friendly to describe systems that require
users to push a "start" button to turn oil a
computer and network connections so in
herently Hawed that even Stanford stu
dents require a dedicated stall person to
handle the problems that inevitably arise.
et, despite this, most of us are dependent
on these systems in our daily lives and deal
w nil our frust rations through gritted teeth.
We know ol no alternative.

is trying to create a future without the con
spicuous and unwieldy desktop boxes that
have taken such a central role in our lives.
Instead, Hewlett-Packard's C.oolTown
project is fix using on a vision of "pervasive
computing," where the next generation of
elet tronic devices, appliances and even fur
niture are .ill connected to a powerful net
woi k en ibliug .1 user to access anv data in

putinghas mi( ropnxcssors embedded into
everything imaginable.
When I visited the Cool I own research
lab a few weeks ago, I saw everything and
evervone automatical connected to a net
work upon entry into ( 'ooltown; no wires to
plug in. no complicated setup — even key
hoards seemed to have vanished along with
their desktop computet counterparts. In
let l.ues for these "context-aware comput
ers will simph rely on voice, touch or even
just your presence in a room.
The technology behind
pervasive computing
Most technologists agree that, in this

world of pervasive comput
ing, people will carry at
least one personal informa
tion device, perhaps the
grandchild of what we
know as a personal digital
assistant or Palm Pilot.
Even tcxlav, we are seeing
convergence of many con
sumer electronics .it a
dizzying rate : the PDA. cel
lular phone, beeper,
portable music player, dig
ital camera and c amcorder,
(i PS receiver, Web brows
er, e-mail messenger. De
vices that pack this func
tionality into the si/e of a
Palm Pilot will become
available sooner than you
may expect.
However, Hewlett-
Packard's vision for the de
vice well exceeds even ibis
(:<X>ll own, all objects emit
their own specific Web ad
dress. The hand-held de
vice acts as the interface be-

tween the physical and digital worlds; it
reads the I RLand sends otliet I RLs back
to <i variety of Web-enabled devices: print
ers, stereos, projection screens and so on.
Embedded microprocessors will be an
other key component of pervasive com
puting. There are already over 10 comput
er chips for every human being on the
planet. II the prices of microprocessors
continue to chop as projected, soonct or
later there will be connectivit\ within
everything from blenders i<> jewelry, with
no substantial price increase. Objects will
all be directly linked into intelligent net
works, transmitting and receiving relevant
information, whether it relates to making

the perfect tnargat ita or sending your cur
rent blood pressure — or alcohol level —
to your private medical database.
I o support these types of services, one
of the biggest c hallenges will be to create
an infrastructure that can handle the
enoi mitv of data streaming to and from all
these objects. I lie foundation the cellular
phone industry c reated will be leveraged
and expanded.
Local area networks will also play a
ke\ role in delivering these services, but
they currenth have had a much smaller
adoption rate than cellular phone net
works. Eurthermoie, competing tech
nologies have made it difficult fora (leai

standard to develop.
Hewlett- Packard's
(oolTown research lab cur
rently uses older, but well es
tablished, infrared data
transmission technology be
cause of this fact. However,
the engineers there are the
first to acknowledge that the
creation of a widely used,
seamless, integrated open
standard network of devices
will be necessary before the
pervasive computing revolu
tion can fully begin.
The future potential
It is easy to get bogged
down in the details of the tech
nology, but what about its
ramifications? Do vou really
want your watch talking to
your refrigerator? Hewlett-
Packard would sa\ yes.
I he Cool' Town repre

the example of a fireman
with a context-aware visor
headset that interacts with

die- Web presence in a house, giving him
updated details about the location of peo
ple or things, as well the location and in
tensitN of the fire. Other safety issues are
being addressed by bioinetric jewelry,
being developed at the MI I Media l.ab
and the 111 M Research ('.enter in Zurich.
Sue h items can come in the form of a ring
with an embedded microprocessor.

and transmit a person's vital signs and

Computers today arc at an embryonic
stage of development, but we have been
taught to accept their limitations. We have
allowed the gross misuse of the term "user
friendly to describe systems that require
users to push a "start" button to turn oil a
computer and network connections so in
herently Hawed that even Stanford stu
dents require a dedicated stall person to
handle the problems that inevitably arise.
et, despite this, most of us are dependent
on these systems in our daily lives and deal

The technology behind

Most technologists agree that, in this

world of pervasive comput

grandchild of what we
know as a personal digital
assistant or Palm Pilot.

er, e-mail messenger. De
vices that pack this func
tionality into the si/e of a

available sooner than you
may expect.

Embedded microprocessors will be an
