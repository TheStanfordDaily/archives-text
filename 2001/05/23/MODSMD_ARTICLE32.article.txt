Erom 1995 to / 99<S', lie was then-President

lie joined ('•rassroots Enterprise, r/ provider
of Internet-based political advocacy soft

(•rassroots Enterprise
stayed in business Iry tran
sitioning from being a
content provider to being
a software company.
W hat was the inspiration
/or (irassroots s slide of
software applications?
And what motivated yon
to become />ait of this po
litical advocacy software
company?
I he idea was driven
l>\ the tremendous
popularity of the
" I ake Action" features
provided on our origi
nal VVeb site. Out
board and staff took
notice of how enthusi-

<isti( people were* about taking action
in support of causes they eared about
online. We recognized a real opportu
nity to influence public policy by lever
aging the Internet as a channel for in
creasing interaction between organi
zations, their members and elected of
ficials. So we have built the next gen
eration of "Take Action" features into
our enterprise-level advocacy soft
ware, so organizations can mobilize
entire memberships.
I joined the staff of Grassroots En
terprise because I think the Internet
is ,i terrific tool for rekindling pco

pie's interest in democratic pat i it ipa
tion. I am .1 big bt*lit*\t*i that tec hnol
ogv will help transform politics lor
ihe better. Right now, von need tons
of monev to buy expensive I V com
mercials to argue your policy ease.
The Internet provides powerful
channels for communication ><> the
average citi/en at far less c ost than .1
S()-second TV ad.
There are other companies that produce
organization/iI and campaign software.

How are (imssrooLs's products heller than
the products of other political advocacy soft
ware comfxinu's, siuh as The Soft Edge and
A rist otle t
Grassroots Multiplier, our latest ad
vocacy software, helps organizations
grow and mobilize their membership
as a force tor influencing public policy.
We use tlu- Internet as a way to gain
support fora cause, provide channels
for taking action and to analyze cam
paign impact. Our software guides an
organization through the process of
creating a complete, targeted online
ac tion campaign, not simply generat

Both our protlut t and our team

team we have assembled is adapting
the best data and relationship man
agement solutions used by Fortune
1000 companies to the unique needs
of the political marketplace. We de
livei out software over the Internet
so an organization can

!<>( us 011 at hieving their
mission, instead of deal
ing with draining instal
lations and constant up
grades.
You've s<iitl that you
rarely grab content online. At
the lunwlI unwl discussion during
the 1 on/emu e, you explained
liowyoui own covif>an\ could
not have survived as a con
tent fmnnder if it had to
change its business model to
su/ceed. W hat will need to
haj>f>cn for 11 eb sites that ftro
vi/lr political news to be more
sutcessfvd?
Depends on how you
define successful. We
helped develop a very
successful Web site that
was both well visited by
voters and used by candi
dates. It provided a very
valuable service during

the last election year. I think political
sites, and political news sites in particu
lar, are valuable resources that will con
tinue to be popular, but not necessarily
profitable. Mv sense is that they will be
most successfully run by nonprofits,
such as the 1-eaguc of Women Voters'
Democracy Network site, which is
www.dnet.org.
At the panel discussion. there •seemed to lu
ll consensus that dot-com workers are very
hkel\ to he involved in community service.
