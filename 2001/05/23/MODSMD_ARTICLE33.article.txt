# Wired editor shares insight

### VIC REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In just one week as an editor at Wired mag
azine, katrina I leron had already attracted a

small crowd of ad
mirers. But her
staffdidn't gather
to look at her —
they stared in
stead .it her pen, a
decidedlv low
tech tool that was
out ol place in the
offices of the na
tion's top technol
ogy magazine.
"Wired does not
support the use
of manual writ
ing instruments,"
one staffer told
her jokingly.
In .1 talk given

on May l"> about "Journalism and the Inter
net''— sponsored by the John S. Knight Fel
lowship Program — Heron shared this and
other experiences from her four-vcar tenure
.is the magazine's editor in < liief.
She began her talk by saying that the Inter
net has not vet fulfilled its promise as a revo
lutionary communication medium. "I don't
read online magazines," I leron said. With the
exception of Fhe Wall Street |ournal, most
publications have not been successful in con
vincing their readers to pay for news online.
"Most of the time, most people won't pay on
line for what they'll pure base on paper all of
the time," she said.
Nonetheless, Heron predicted that Wired
and other publications will eventually be on
line and out of print. "Magazine publishing
doesn't have a great future; distribution is in
sane," she said.
Heron related one Internet journalism
success story involving two former .Stanford
computet science doctoral students. Sergev
Brin and Fairy Page, the creators of the
(ioogle search engine, are two "journalists"
who are helping the Web reach its potential,
she said.
By using hyperlink structure to weight
Web pages, (ioogle provides arguably the
best online search results. At the very least,
it does not drive Web traffic in one dircc

tion, unlike some scan li engines uiih slial
lower algorithms, she explained. I lit' Inter
net is participatory and democratic, Ileum
said, .uid doodle makes ii more accessible.
According to Heron, Brin and Page's work

brings us ,i "world
ol second-opinion
übiquity" — part
ol tlie promise of
the Web.
"Believe in
the Internet More
Than Ever" is the
title of the June
issue of Wired, one
of the last issues that
Heron will edit. It
juxtaposes business
icons Berkshire
Hathaway Chief
Executive Officer
Warren Bullet and
Intel co-founder
and Chairman

Andy (.rove. While attending Berkshire
llathawav s shareholder meeting in Omaha
to rcsean h the story, I leron s.iid she was im
pressed by tlie stability and durability <>1 Bul
let's company. "We're under no pressure to
do anything dumb," Bullet s.iid at the meet
ing. "How many CEOs in the Vallev can s,i\
that?" I leron asked at her talk.
But, she said, she found herself "home
sick for danger." She explained that Sl l i< on
Valley pioneers like drove are willing to
strike out in new directions and that she is
most impressed In this quality in business
leaders, drove would agree, I leron suggest
ed, th.it "a hand in the bush is worth two on
the bird."
When asked In an audience membei about
her plans to leave Wired fora job that will give
her more time with her children. Heron re
sponded, "I feel like the maga/ine \s ill be line.
It knows where it's going.'
In response to anothci question on tech
nology journalism, I leron s.iid that reporting
011 Silicon Valley entrepreneurs is not funda
mentally different from reporting on politic al
events: "It's about telling a story," she ex
plained.
But something's nibbed off, and Heron
herself is striking out in a new direction.
"When von learn something, move on,"
she said.
