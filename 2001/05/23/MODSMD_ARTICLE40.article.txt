on guilt, savs that guilt
breaks clown into three
main domains: legal,
philosophical and ps\-
c bologic al.
Legal gtiilt implies
culpability for au ille

court of law. Of
( ourse, "not guilt v" in
legal terms does not
alwavs mean "inno
cent. Philosophical
guilt takes the con-

(ept of legal guilt and applies 11 ici
moral laws and < odes. 11 you do some
thing that goes against an ethi< a I stan
dard, you incur this kind ol gnilt.
l-inallv, psychological gnilt arises

thing wrong and I eel rem 01 si-I'n I about

dailv lives the most. Psychological
guilt (.in come from main different
sources, especially i elationships with
othei people.
II you talk to fellow students
about what makes them feel guiltv,
answers range across the board.
Some feel guill\ because of prob
lems with friends and fainilv, others
because of some past wrongdoing,
and many just because of being .it
Stanford. Over half of the partici
pants in one dormitoi \ s Crossing
the Line activity agreed with the
statement, "I feel guill\ about being
at Stanford."
I his well-known Stanford guilt ex
empli lies existential guilt, which does not
result from anv ac Ui.il transgression. < )ne
common form involves .1 sense of |>«>sii i\c
inecjuity. Main Stanford students feel

tbat tbey do not deserve to be bere, thai
11ic\ rewarded with admission to the
sc liool while peers ol ecju.il standing did
not. 1 bis guilt stems from a general de
sire foi things to be distributed equitably.
\\ hen distribution is not equal, everyone
feels bad — those people who get the.'

who benefit from the i i ie< 111 it \ feel guilt v.

Anothei kind of existential guilt seen
.11 Stanford results from students fail
ing to reach then lull potential. Stu
dents feel guilty not 101 doing some
thing wrong, but for neglecting to do
enough right. Whcthei 01 not these
students are coi let 1, the\ feel that the\

Sin pi isingl\, guilt can .ilso have- pos
itive elfei is, espei ia 11 \ 111 the context of
relationships. Psychologists R c»\
liaumeister. \rlcnc Stillwell and I odd
I le.it he 1 ton analvved resean h findings
on the interpersonal aspects of guilt.
I liev observed that guilt often works to
protect, m.lint.llll and strengthen cer
tain kinds of six 1.11 bonds. In "ex
change" relationships, one part\ helps
the other 0111v to receive ilirei t benefit s.
I licse contrast with "communal" rela
tionships, in uliitli the parties do
things 101 each othei without expeiting
immediate reward.
In communal relationships, guilt (.111
be helplul. I'm most suriplv, it rewards
behavior that enhances the relationship
and punishes heliavioi that disrupts it. It

makes you pay .mention to the feelings of
others !)<.•< ause, it vou hurt them, you too
will feel l).id because of guilt. In the same
way, it redistributes emotional distress so
th.it the wronged person doesn't end up
being the only one feeling bad. In a rela
tionship with unequal power distribu
tion, the weaker person in the relation
ship can also use guilt as a tool. Bv induc-

ing guilt in the stronger
person, the weaker pet son
can get what he or she
wants without using ver
bal or physical fort e.
I'll esc benefits of
guilt are often over
looked; we tend to
think of guilt as a nega
tive etnotion with nega
tive effet ts. I n fact, like
many things, guilt
works best in modera
tion. 100 little guilt
means th.it nothing in
tern.il will inhibit us
from hurt ing <>t her
people .ind doiiiu I).id

tilings looin in h gui 11, on i lu- other
hand, leads to emotional distress and
p.ii al\ /ing iii.u t ion.
I he latter problem is more evident
in the Stanford corn inn nit \. So how can
we work to overcome guilt ? Main peo
ple deal with g u 111 l>\ dwelling on it be
cause of the strong lempiation to wal
low in I).id feelings. I nforl unatelv, iliis
