Lcong explained that the drug
works In blocking calcium chan
nels in the nervous system. The
calcium channels, part ola larger
complex known as NMDA recep
tors, transmit pain messages in the
spinal cord.
Administering the new drug inac
tivates only those neurons that
transmit pain and leaves other neu
rons uuaffee ted.

predatory cone snails, which d.ut at and

because neither researchers nor

Bruce l.ivett, who is .in associate
professor of biochemistry at the Uni
vcrsit\ of Melbourne in Australia and
who h as studied SNX-11l for many
years, discussed some of the advan
tages of the drug.
"[Ziconotidc] olniousk provides a

already lined wit 11 a surgically implanted
mini-pnmp for morphine, then the /i

same way."
Christine Heading, a pharmacist in

the I nitcd King
dom who has
written a reyievv
on /iconotide,
added, " I lie
drug seems to be
a major break
through. I'.ven il
/iconotide does
not live up to ex
pec tat ions — al
though it may
well do so — it is
likelv to be fol
lowed by others
that will be even
better."
Leong did
point out some
drawbacks to the
drug.
"One of the
disadvantages
of the drug is
that it needs to
be inieited di-

in iii|iiiiii ill
rcctlv into the spinal lliiicl or cere
brospinal fluid because of its high
toxi( it\lie said. " I bis will make the
drug more expensive."
Lcong also said that, despite affect
ing the nervous system and not the
heart, side-effects of the drug could
iiu lude di//iness, nausea and low
blood pressure.
Liven said that many companies
are racing to develop pharmaceuticals
.ind therapeutical potentials with
SNX-l 1 I. He cited F.lan Pharmaceuti
cals in South San Francisco — which
sponsored the Stanford research in
part — Cognetix in Salt Lake (atv and
Xcnome in Brisbane, Australia, as the
major players.
" I here are rumors that other
conctoxins can also be exploited.
Perhaps in the future we may use
them as post-operative pain reliev
ers," Leong said.
