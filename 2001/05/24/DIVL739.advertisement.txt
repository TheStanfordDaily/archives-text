Join us for the release of Stanford
Professor Simone Di Piero s newest
collection of poetry, Skirts and Slacks,
which carries the central motif of "careful
watching of urban landscapes." A poet,
translator, art critic and professor,
Di Piero has been described as a
"master of impresionistic candlelight",
"precise and emphatic" with a "great
talent for close description". Inside
Skirts and Slacks are "thoughtful
poetic compositions" that "combine
serious imagery with truth in words
"Refreshing poetry that gets
better with reading."
