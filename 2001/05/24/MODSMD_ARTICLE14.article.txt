On May 24, 1982, I "lie Daily printed ail article
about astronaut Sallv Ride.

It seems lilting tli.it Sally Ride's first one-on-one
interview since the announcement of liei upcoming
Space Shuttle mission (scheduled for IWA) should
be granted to The Daily. After all, n was almost ex
actly four years ago that astropln si< s doctoral candi
date Ride read a notice in I lie Daih that NASA was
acteptingastronaut applications.
"Ride is unmistakably fond of the I 'niversity: 1 still
have in\ Stanford book bag,' she admits, pointing to
ward a red nylon pack, but her appreciation for Stan
ford is best evidenced l>\ liei acknowledgment that
the four degrees (two bachelors — one in Knglish,
one in physics — a master's in physics and a doctor
ate in astrophysics) she received here prepared her
well for the challenges of astronaut training."
Bottom line: You never know what The Daily can do for you.
