overdone, but this saying, and oth

lete from the first time they lace up their cleats or
tie their suits until then last game or event. I his
attitude, which sadly and dangerously, thrives
like <tn epidemic in college athletics, places the
athletes between Scylla and Charvbdis, with no
choice but to win at anv costs. Why has winning
overtaken the tun of competition? l he answer
lies in the mordant subtlety of the saving above.
Ask anv athlete on campus, whether they are
warming up lot a pic k-up game or the (Mynipic
finals, what theii goal is. and they will answer sim

needed to aflirni the team's devastation; one just

needed to look .it the faces of the players to see the

Where has the joy of competing gone? And,

WINMNd ISN'I KYT.RYTI UNO,
it's tlie onlv thing! Sounds tl ite and
overdone, but this saying, and oth
ers expressing thf same drastic sen
timent, are pounded into the heads of every ath
lete from the first time they lace up their cleats or
tie their suits until then last game or event. I his
attitude, which sadly and dangerously, thrives
like <tn epidemic in college athletics, places the
athletes between Scylla and Charvbdis, with no
choice but to win at anv costs. Why has winning
overtaken the tun of competition? l he answer
lies in the mordant subtlety of the saving above.
Ask anv athlete on campus, whether they are
warming up lot a pic k-up game or the (Mynipic
finals, what theii goal is. and they will answer sim
ply, "to win. And.it Stanford, with .i rich athletic
history that m< hides gold medal winners, Woi Id
Series champions. Nil. stars and hundreds of
other championship te.mis, the definition ol win
ning lias transformed into one thing: winning
National Championships and the Sears ( up.

This is how we boast to the rest of the country.
Sure, we have Nobel Prize winners and out
campus is beautiful, but bet you didn't know tli.n
we arc the onlv school ili.it hascvei won the Sears
Cup. We have placed such a premium on win
ning that we c an t accept second place am more.
No "best eflort," no "good trv. no "get em next
time. No, it's win, period.
I Ins year, we have witnessed onlv one Nation
al (lhampionship. Most schools would be hooting
and hollering ovei this one accomplishment, but
not here, not with oui three runner-up silvei
plaques bowing our heads in shame. Rec entK. in
the* last seconds ol the national championship
game, the women's w.itet polo team lost its iiist
game .ill season to I ( L\. Within seconds of ille
gal lie's final horn, the accolades, the accomplish
ment of the :40-l season, the league title and the
personal pride all evaporated into salt\ tears, re
placed by the immediate and deprecating an
guish ovei falling just short. No interviews were
needed to aflirni the team's devastation; one just

needed to look .it the faces of the players to see the
tears streaming clown. I hat told the whole story.
Where has the joy of competing gone? And,
more importantly, where have our values
straved? This season, in anticipation of our first
nation.il championship since the HMOs, thou
sands of loyal fans bought season tickets and
watched the basketball team win its third straight
Pacific 10 (onference (lhampionship and secure
.i spot in the NCAA Tournament. Quite an ac
complishment, hut, oik c again, after the team lost
in the regional finals, the season was immediately
deemed a failure. I 'his win-at-all-costs attitude is
damaging to the athletes and the Athletics De
partment. Athletics is built around competi
tion — with oneself, with the < lock, with another
team. Somewhere along the way, winning —
beating others — choked out all else, becoming
the onlv goal. (loaches and the Athletics Depart
ment directors will sav that winning isn't every
thing, but look at the numbei of coaching vacan
cies after even losing season; Losing isn't toler.it-

come cultural icons, flaunting their success in the
faces of the losers. It doesn't take one of those
Nobel Prize winners to determine how young
kids learn that winning is good and losing unac
ceptable.
