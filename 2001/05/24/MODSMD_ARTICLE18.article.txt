The alarm < 1< >< k rings .it nine in
the morning. Yon do itle to
sleep in lor )i ist live more min
utes. Iwo hours later, von
stumble out ol bed. Un ions at voni sell lot
missing ( hisses. Sleep in 01 go to class, th.it
perennial dilemma. I could wax rhapsod
ic about existential < lioice, ,i la Sartre. In
stead, I want to ask. how was it that the
same "yon" wanted two dillerent, even
contradictory, things?
On the lace ol it, regret is not prob-

leinatit. Anger at one
self happens so often
that we don't think
about it anymore. Its a
lat t ol life, like the blue
ness of the skv, like love,
like death. But if physi
cists (let hies) explain
the blue sk\. and wt iters
(fuz/ies) talk about
love and death and the

death of love, we soci.il scientists (bu
llies) need something to do. So we ,isk, ll
we can regret a decision todav. why
didn't we make another choice, the c m -
tec t clec isk>n. vesterdav?
Plato had a simple answer — lack <>l
knowledge. I'ropet knowledge prompts
yon to do the right thing al\\a\ s. Regret is
an ex post phenomenon. I.x .mte, von
didn't have the knowledge I«> make the
right dec ision. Aftei von made the (wrong)
choice, von gained some knowledge th.it,
had it heen possessed vesterdav, would
have led to the right decision. In the ele
gant language of economic s. regret comes
from .1 c hange in informational conditions.
Kut this is a strange explanation. If you
couldn't have done the right thing yester
day, given youi situation, you'd he- upset
at your situation lather than yourself.
You'd he c hagrined, hut you'd feel no re
gret. At least, that's the attitude self-help
pop psychology has drummed into all of
us. Blaming yourself, rather Ihan the- situ
ation over which you had no control, is an
"attribution error." You wouldn't make
that error.
You'd say, "It's beyond my control."
Regret is something else. It's not the
wish that the person you are today, wiili
superior knowledge, replaced the igno
rant person you were yesterday. It's as if
the you-today wished that an entirely dif
ferent person, the you-yesteiclay, had
acted some other way.
Regret involves multiple personalities.
Take an example from every Stanford
student's list of top-10 topic s to jump-start
conversation: procrastination. I procrasli

nate totla\ kl l«>wing lull well I will regret it
tomorrow. \nd when tomorrow comes, I
do indeed regret it. So win proi rastinate?
I here's no real reason, except that the
pel son making the choice loda\ isn't (jniti*
the same pel son repenting tomorrow. A
coherent personality would make consis
tent choices.'l'o the extent that we regret
anything at all, we're I rat lured, split apart,
and maybe s< hi/oplu eiii<.
It's as il 1 have two selves, eat li altei Dat
ing in command ol me.
I'ake another example. I loiner tells ol
()dysseus's encounter with the Sirens. I lie
Sirens' song inevitably lures men to then
deaths, but (Jtlvssctis wants to licai it. I le
instructs Ins men to tie him to the mast ol
his ship and not to release linn no mattci
what he says later when he hears the
Sirens' s< >ng, whether he begs 01 threatens
or cajoles. Odysseus saws himsell by this
method. I'o avoid regret, ()dvsscus-toda\
lias found a wav to restr.iin Odvssens-to
morrow from an action — seeking the
Sirens and thus drowning — that
()d\sseus-toniorrow would lake.
Not having regret means keeping mill
tiple personalities in line. It means having
one personalis dominate and outsmart
the other.
I hat's win Niet/si he sa\s that the good
lile. the virtuous lilc, is one that vou do not
regret, that you would be happy to live
over and ovei again, in eternal < yc le with
out end. No regret implies a ( ohereul per
sonality, a single actor. That, in turn, re
tinitis immense willpower, in fat t, the will
it) power.
Sounds good, but how to do it? Not
main of us have the wilv genius of ()d\sseus
or the iron will of the Niel/sthean super
man. I have an easier recommendation.
Self-deception.
1 his is easy to see. You've got two per
sonalities. one that prefers to sleep in and
another that prefers to go to class. Have
the latter person deceive the former.
Make him or her believe tli.it sleeping in is
really bad. In fact, that he or she will be
punished lor sleeping in. I.ie to your
(other) self. II he or she is gullible enough,
you'll never miss morning lectures ever
again. You'll always do the right thing.
I he world will be a better place. II we
could all practice this sort <>1 Orwcllian
doublethink, we'll never regret anything
again.

The alarm < 1< >< k rings .it nine in
the morning. Yon do itle to
sleep in lor )i ist live more min
utes. Iwo hours later, von
stumble out ol bed. Un ions at voni sell lot
missing ( hisses. Sleep in 01 go to class, th.it
perennial dilemma. I could wax rhapsod
ic about existential < lioice, ,i la Sartre. In
stead, I want to ask. how was it that the
same "yon" wanted two dillerent, even
contradictory, things?
On the lace ol it, regret is not prob-

leinatit. Anger at one
self happens so often
that we don't think
about it anymore. Its a
lat t ol life, like the blue
ness of the skv, like love,
like death. But if physi
cists (let hies) explain
the blue sk\. and wt iters
(fuz/ies) talk about
love and death and the

death of love, we soci.il scientists (bu
llies) need something to do. So we ,isk, ll
we can regret a decision todav. why
didn't we make another choice, the c m -
tec t clec isk>n. vesterdav?
Plato had a simple answer — lack <>l
knowledge. I'ropet knowledge prompts
yon to do the right thing al\\a\ s. Regret is
an ex post phenomenon. I.x .mte, von
didn't have the knowledge I«> make the
right dec ision. Aftei von made the (wrong)
choice, von gained some knowledge th.it,
had it heen possessed vesterdav, would
have led to the right decision. In the ele
gant language of economic s. regret comes
from .1 c hange in informational conditions.
Kut this is a strange explanation. If you
couldn't have done the right thing yester
day, given youi situation, you'd he- upset
at your situation lather than yourself.
You'd he c hagrined, hut you'd feel no re
gret. At least, that's the attitude self-help
pop psychology has drummed into all of
us. Blaming yourself, rather Ihan the- situ
ation over which you had no control, is an
"attribution error." You wouldn't make
that error.
You'd say, "It's beyond my control."
Regret is something else. It's not the
wish that the person you are today, wiili
superior knowledge, replaced the igno
rant person you were yesterday. It's as if
the you-today wished that an entirely dif
ferent person, the you-yesteiclay, had
acted some other way.
