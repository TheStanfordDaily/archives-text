Freshman car ban has 'done real
damage to the overall experience'
Like main graduates, I've Ik-cm .i little
out <>l loiu li w iili what's happening ba< k
oil I lie 1.11 in. lin appalled lo lind that I lie
I nivci mi\ banned freshman tars.
Road nips are eve-opening experi
emes iliai allow students lo s.miple the
real world while siill in tlie relalive s.tlc

are the "rounded'' activities that make
Stanlord 11 tiicjue and desirable to go to.
111st as the Admissions OlVue doesn't
choose candidates to enter the Ireshnian
(l.iss solely based on academics, aca
demics have never been the onl\ reason
to apply to Stanlord.
It's the many experiences available
nearby and the interactions with I lie sur
rounding community. I hese jaunts are
the "testing" ground ol new knowledge
gained through soa.il interaction and aca
demics. My own college roommate intro
duced me lo many different and unique
Korean dishes at <i restaurant many miles
away. Another dormmate introduced me
lo kiwi and grape farming, as well as to his
father's research and experimentation
with a newly created paving product. And
it didn't slop there.

I suggest you ask the alumni 111 a survey
whether the\ would have been as involved
and learned as much outside of the I ni
versitv if the ban had been in plate then. A
ban like this does damage not only to the
Stanford experience, but it definitely
11111 ts the community that might otherwise
benefit from the involvement of more mo
bile students. 1 'aken further, what hap
pens to the religious life of the individual
who "marches to a dillerent drummer,"
wanting to trv out new churches in the
metropolitan area, but who can't because
ol the inabilit\ to find someone else inter
ested who has <i car?
I think the administration has done
real damage to the overall experient e, the
student antl the surrounding community,
and I hope they warn future applicants
first.

University has no space for freshman cars
I've heard a lot of people — staff
columnist |osh Fried being the most re
cent — say that freslunen should Ik- al
lowed to park on campus. Fhey've all ig
nored the question: If we give freshmen
parking permits, where will they park?
We're lacing a serious over-demand lor
cars — also called a "parking shortage."
Would we make Wilbur Field into a park
ing lot in order to satisfy our desire for
parking spots? Would we prefer to build

an underground parking lot instead of
subsidizing graduate student housing?
II we don't want to build mote parking
lots, whom shall we ask not to drive? Will
we ask Stanford employees to use mass
transit belbre we ask freshmen to forgo
carsr Or will we eliminate one option
driving to class, whit li usually means tak
ing more than one parking space at .1
time — iu order to protect another
option — for mostly wealthy underclass
men to have cars?
I don't care so much about cars and
parking, just about narrow-minded, "not
in m\ backyard" thinking. I see this think
ing everywhere.
I hose of us who seek, for example, .1
campus "living wage" or an end to Stan
ford s endorsement of Nike, should con
sider the costs of the change we advocate.
Will we cut administrators' salaries 111
order to increase janitors' — and so possi
bly attract a dillercnt kind of administra
tor.' Without millions from Nike, will we
cut athletic programs, and thereby sacri
fice some of the public relations benefits
that accompany successful sports teams?
I he endowment'' — as many millions as
it is — is not infinite.
Nothing is. And, as our population and
demands continue to rise, we're facing
more scarcity, Im>ili <11 Stanford and glob
ally. Our demands will increasingly affect
others'. The sooner we realize this, the bel
ter we'll all get along.
