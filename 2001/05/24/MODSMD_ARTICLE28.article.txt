### 
The Die ■se I. 1 lie Daddy.
Shaq-Fu. ('.all liitn
what ever you want.
Shaquille (VNeal is 1 lie
most dominant and om
nipresent figure in professional
sports at the moment.
Sorry, Tigre, O'Neal's Lakers
haven't lost in a game in the plav
ofls, and it's still about a month
until you turn this year's U.S.
()pen into televised putt putt.
With equal parts Herculean

strength and ef
fervescent charis
ma, Shaq has led
the Lakers on a
tear throughout
the playoffs —
eliminating the
dream team
Blazers and
fa n - fa vo rite

Kings without breaking a sweat.
Already up 2-0 on the Spurs —
who boasted the NBA s best reg
ular-season record — the Lakers
and their fans are starting to
whisper (albeit very quietly)
about the possibility of running
the table in the playoffs with nan
a loss.
And, oh, by the way, Shaq is
tossing in 29 points a game and
snatching 15.7 rebounds.
What vexes me isu'i Shaq's
dominance (if I went down to the
local elementary school ai recess
.ind played some pickup, I'd put
up those kind of numbers, too) or
the Lakers' winning ways (Shaq is
surrounded by a cast that in
cludes the man-child virtuoso
Kobe Bryant and a bunch ol
savvy vets). What I can't figure
out is why the media and the gen
eral public continue to excoriate
Shaq.
While lie's by no means a pari
ah in athlete standards (} son
Williams and Frank Thomas w ill
be (hiking it out for that title now
that they both have some free
time on their hands), Shaq lias
never quite been the media dar
ling that lie could and should be.
And, more than that, Shaq lias
yet to garner the respect as an
athlete — and, more important
ly, as a person — that he de
serves.
Sure, he claimed to have slepi
with Candy ('.rawford and a bevy
of other notable beauties. While I
fault him for his dishonesty and

his l.t* k ol respect fbi women,
most warm-blooded in.tics can
sympathize wit li ili.it one.
Sine, lu- still has .1 little trou
ble from the free-throw line
the game's easiest shot. lint, un
like main professional athletes,
he recognizes Ins fault and
works tirelessK to get better.
Shaq lias the ke\s to the local
high school g\m near his house.
«ind you're much more likel\ to
find him there shooting free
throws after a game than von
are at .1 club witli Michael Irvin,
Ray Lewis and "associates."
Sure, he did "kazaam." ()ka\.
well. I don't have an answet lot
von on that one.
But, 111 a host ol other u.ins.
Shaq represents a lot about what
is right about professional spoils
in toda\ s da\ and age.
He has proven himsell not
only as a dominant plaver, but
also a winner, with an NBAc ha 111-
pionship ring and an Olvmpic
(»olcl Medal to Ins < redit.
Yet, what hasrealK m.idemea
believer in Shaq-mania — and a
strong supportei of the big gn\
— is what he has at (omplished
oil the court.
Exhibit A: While he left Lou
sianna State early to pursue Ins
career in the NBA. he worked
hard in the off-season to earn
enough credits to get his de
gree. I here are .1 lot ol super
stars in the league who left
school e.irb — il lhe\ attended
«it all — who certainh cannot
say t lie same.
As 1 wrote about last week, the
phenomenon ol plavcrs b\ pass
ing all 01 part ol tlieii collegiatc
careers to make the jump to tin
pros lias had a profound effect
on collegiate spot is. While Shaq 's
example ccrtainh does not pro
vide them with .1 disincentive
against leaving school earlv, his
dedication lo finishing his studies
is a laudable example in this eta
when the almighty dollar seems
to be 1 fie onh thing on the minds
of basketball players between t lit
ages ol lour and l J. r >.
Exhibit B: Despite the ru
mors you might hear, Shaq is
just a good guy, plain and sim
ple. In a time when main pro
fessional athletes spend more


Ben Jones
time in court than Judge Wapn
er, Shaq has never had his in
tegrity called into question.
While I certainly echo the
sentiments of Chris Rock about
people "trying to take credit for
shit thev supposed to be doing
anvway," Shaq provides no fod
der tor the media to criticize
him the way they do.
And, more than that, Shaq is
pretty much an overgrown 12-
\ ear-old whose primary occupa
tion other th.in basketball is
having fun.
Kxhibit C: Like other athletes,
who have received far more
praise, O'Neal has given a great
deal back to his community.
I his ( hristmas season, on the
spur of the moment, Shaq
loaded up a brand-new truck
with tens of thousands of dollars
worth of toys, drove to South
Central and spent the day like a
clunking Santa Clause, signing
autographs for kids and hand
ing out presents. That's not a PR
coup. 1 hat's not the obligatory
trip to the children's hospital.
I hat's the work of a man with a
giant heart that matches his
giant physique.
And this is just one of the many
examples of O'Neal's unyielding

generosity and love for people
from San Antonio to Louisiana to
Los Angeles.
Exhibit I): Shaq made Mad
Dog hip.
We .ill love you Mark Madsen,
but we all remember the white
short sleeve shirt and tie, black
slacks and tennis shoes look.
Early in the season, Shaq took
his new teammate shopping and
outfitted him with a new set of
more sylish L.A. duds.
If Shaq can get Mad Dog in
Hugo Boss, he should be nomi
nated for some sort of Nobel
Prize. Two more miracles, and
I'll call John Paul about the can
onization myself.
We often question whether
athletes "deserve" the success,
fame and riches that are heaped
upon them. And there aren't al
ways clear "yes"sand "no"s.
However, Shaquille O'Neal
has proven that success on the
court and in life are not inversely
related. His actions deserve a
great deal more praise than they
receive.
I'ssst. I ley, Shaq. Just one more
thing. 1 like you a lot already, big
guy, but, next year, when that
rookie Jason Collins gets in the
league, dunk on him one time for
me. Dunk on him hard.

like main professional athletes,
he recognizes Ins fault and
works tirelessK to get better.
Shaq lias the ke\s to the local
high school g\m near his house.
«ind you're much more likel\ to
find him there shooting free
throws after a game than von
are at .1 club witli Michael Irvin,
Ray Lewis and "associates."
Sure, he did "kazaam." ()ka\.
well. I don't have an answet lot
von on that one.
But, 111 a host ol other u.ins.
Shaq represents a lot about what
is right about professional spoils
in toda\ s da\ and age.
He has proven himsell not
only as a dominant plaver, but
also a winner, with an NBAc ha 111-
pionship ring and an Olvmpic
(»olcl Medal to Ins < redit.
Yet, what hasrealK m.idemea
believer in Shaq-mania — and a
strong supportei of the big gn\
— is what he has at (omplished
oil the court.
Exhibit A: While he left Lou
sianna State early to pursue Ins
career in the NBA. he worked
hard in the off-season to earn
enough credits to get his de
gree. I here are .1 lot ol super
stars in the league who left
school e.irb — il lhe\ attended
«it all — who certainh cannot
say t lie same.
As 1 wrote about last week, the
phenomenon ol plavcrs b\ pass
ing all 01 part ol tlieii collegiatc
careers to make the jump to tin
pros lias had a profound effect
on collegiate spot is. While Shaq 's
example ccrtainh does not pro
vide them with .1 disincentive
against leaving school earlv, his
dedication lo finishing his studies
is a laudable example in this eta
when the almighty dollar seems
to be 1 fie onh thing on the minds
of basketball players between t lit
ages ol lour and l J. r >.
Exhibit B: Despite the ru
mors you might hear, Shaq is
just a good guy, plain and sim
ple. In a time when main pro
fessional athletes spend more


Ben Jones
time in court than Judge Wapn
er, Shaq has never had his in
tegrity called into question.
While I certainly echo the
sentiments of Chris Rock about
people "trying to take credit for
shit thev supposed to be doing
anvway," Shaq provides no fod
der tor the media to criticize
him the way they do.
And, more than that, Shaq is
pretty much an overgrown 12-
\ ear-old whose primary occupa
tion other th.in basketball is
having fun.
Kxhibit C: Like other athletes,
who have received far more
praise, O'Neal has given a great
deal back to his community.
I his ( hristmas season, on the
spur of the moment, Shaq
loaded up a brand-new truck
with tens of thousands of dollars
worth of toys, drove to South
Central and spent the day like a
clunking Santa Clause, signing
autographs for kids and hand
ing out presents. That's not a PR
coup. 1 hat's not the obligatory
trip to the children's hospital.
I hat's the work of a man with a
giant heart that matches his
giant physique.
And this is just one of the many
examples of O'Neal's unyielding

generosity and love for people
from San Antonio to Louisiana to
Los Angeles.
Exhibit I): Shaq made Mad
Dog hip.
We .ill love you Mark Madsen,
but we all remember the white
short sleeve shirt and tie, black
slacks and tennis shoes look.
Early in the season, Shaq took
his new teammate shopping and
outfitted him with a new set of
more sylish L.A. duds.
If Shaq can get Mad Dog in
Hugo Boss, he should be nomi
nated for some sort of Nobel
Prize. Two more miracles, and
I'll call John Paul about the can
onization myself.
We often question whether
athletes "deserve" the success,
fame and riches that are heaped
upon them. And there aren't al
ways clear "yes"sand "no"s.
However, Shaquille O'Neal
has proven that success on the
court and in life are not inversely
related. His actions deserve a
great deal more praise than they
receive.
I'ssst. I ley, Shaq. Just one more
thing. 1 like you a lot already, big
guy, but, next year, when that
rookie Jason Collins gets in the
league, dunk on him one time for
me. Dunk on him hard.

The Die ■se I. 1 lie Daddy.
Shaq-Fu. ('.all liitn
what ever you want.
Shaquille (VNeal is 1 lie
most dominant and om
nipresent figure in professional
sports at the moment.
Sorry, Tigre, O'Neal's Lakers
haven't lost in a game in the plav
ofls, and it's still about a month
until you turn this year's U.S.
()pen into televised putt putt.
With equal parts Herculean

strength and ef
fervescent charis
ma, Shaq has led
the Lakers on a
tear throughout
the playoffs —
eliminating the
dream team
Blazers and
fa n - fa vo rite

Kings without breaking a sweat.
Already up 2-0 on the Spurs —
who boasted the NBA s best reg
ular-season record — the Lakers
and their fans are starting to
whisper (albeit very quietly)
about the possibility of running
the table in the playoffs with nan
a loss.
And, oh, by the way, Shaq is
tossing in 29 points a game and
snatching 15.7 rebounds.
What vexes me isu'i Shaq's
dominance (if I went down to the
local elementary school ai recess
.ind played some pickup, I'd put
up those kind of numbers, too) or
the Lakers' winning ways (Shaq is
surrounded by a cast that in
cludes the man-child virtuoso
Kobe Bryant and a bunch ol
savvy vets). What I can't figure
out is why the media and the gen
eral public continue to excoriate
Shaq.
While lie's by no means a pari
ah in athlete standards (} son
Williams and Frank Thomas w ill
be (hiking it out for that title now
that they both have some free
time on their hands), Shaq lias
never quite been the media dar
ling that lie could and should be.
And, more than that, Shaq lias
yet to garner the respect as an
athlete — and, more important
ly, as a person — that he de
serves.
Sure, he claimed to have slepi
with Candy ('.rawford and a bevy
of other notable beauties. While I
fault him for his dishonesty and

his l.t* k ol respect fbi women,
most warm-blooded in.tics can
sympathize wit li ili.it one.
