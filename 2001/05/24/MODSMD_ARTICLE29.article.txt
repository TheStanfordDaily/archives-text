IX)S ANGELES (AP) — The Los An
geles Lakers are 24-5 since Derek Eisher
returned to the team after missing the
lirst (>2 games with a stress fracture in Ins
light foot.
I hey carry a 17-game winning streak
into (lame 3 of the Western Conference
finals against San Antonio on Eriday
night. I"he possibility they could be the
first NBA team to sweep through the
playoffs doesn't seem lar-fetched.
kolx- Bryant is spectacular. Shaquille
()'Neal is a monster in the middle. Eisher is
the defensive energi/er. Against the Spurs,
he's also been the long-range sniper — 7-
lor-Non 3-pointers in two games.
"Derek plays all out every minute that
lie's on the floor," Bryant said. "He gets up
in guys, he gets in the passing lanes, lie's
very physical. Having me and him in the
backcourt allows us to apply more pres
sure thail we did earlier in the season."
Eisher said he almost decided to write
off the entire season.
"I was close," he said. "Toward the
end of the process, I was getting really
frustrated with not being able to get
back as soon as I wanted to. I was one
day away from deciding |ust to sit out
the rest of the season."
But when he found out he would get
to play at least 20 games, he decided that
was long enough to warrant a comeback.
With the Lakers 9-0 in the playoffs, Eish
er has averaged 13.9 points and has gone
