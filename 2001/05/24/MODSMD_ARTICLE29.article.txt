IX)S ANGELES (AP) — The Los An
geles Lakers are 24-5 since Derek Eisher
returned to the team after missing the
lirst (>2 games with a stress fracture in Ins
light foot.
I hey carry a 17-game winning streak
into (lame 3 of the Western Conference
finals against San Antonio on Eriday
night. I"he possibility they could be the
first NBA team to sweep through the
playoffs doesn't seem lar-fetched.
kolx- Bryant is spectacular. Shaquille
()'Neal is a monster in the middle. Eisher is
the defensive energi/er. Against the Spurs,
he's also been the long-range sniper — 7-
lor-Non 3-pointers in two games.
"Derek plays all out every minute that
lie's on the floor," Bryant said. "He gets up
in guys, he gets in the passing lanes, lie's
very physical. Having me and him in the
backcourt allows us to apply more pres
sure thail we did earlier in the season."
Eisher said he almost decided to write
off the entire season.
"I was close," he said. "Toward the
end of the process, I was getting really
frustrated with not being able to get
back as soon as I wanted to. I was one
day away from deciding |ust to sit out
the rest of the season."
But when he found out he would get
to play at least 20 games, he decided that
was long enough to warrant a comeback.
With the Lakers 9-0 in the playoffs, Eish
er has averaged 13.9 points and has gone

17-lor-37 In>lll li-point range.

Fisher said he just tries t<» pla\ hard.
"Possessions are reallx important in
playoll haskethall." lishei said, "and .tin
time a hall is loose or available to be
picked up, I'm living to be then*. II I
have to lay niv bod\ out on the (loot t< > get
it, that's what I'm going to do."
Alter yesterdav s workout at tin* Ltkeis
practice fa< ilit\ in F.I Segundo. imu li ol the
talk was about <mothei Derek — Derek
Anderson, who is expected to return loi
the Spurs alter being sidelined liti nearh
three weeks with .i separated shouldci.
Anderson was liuit on a llagiant foul
by (uwan Howard in (ianie I <>1 the sec
ond-round series against Dallas.
Fisher suspects that I bikers coach I'hil

son. and have Fisliet guard the Spurs'
point guard. lit van! has guarded point
guards I err) Portei and Aven |olinson
most ol the liist two games, while lishei
has gone against Antonio Daniels.
Fisher said Anderson's return should
lie an emotional boost to the
Spurs.
" I hey might feel a little better
about themselves in terms of hav
ing their lineup back intact,"
Fisher said. "We're a perfect ex
ample of when you get key play
ers back in your lineup, it can re
ally help your team."
Bryant said Anderson does
pose new problems.

"You have to be very careful with
the ball around him because he has
great hands," Bryant said. "He lias
quick feet. He does a good job of
keeping me in front of him. But for
the most part I 'm not too concerned
with that matc hup. All we do is do
what we do, play the triangle of
fense and try to win the game."
I lie Lakers are shrugging off
any talk of going undefeated
throughout the playoffs.
"It is out there but it's not a dis
traction," forward Rick Fox said.
"It is a goal to tack on to the goal of
being the last one standing."
