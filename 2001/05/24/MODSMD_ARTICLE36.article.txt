# "The Green Album"
## Weezer 
### Jung Lah, Staff Writer 
11 there's one thing Wee/er is ridiculously good at, it's
< raiting .in irresistible blend ol power pop tli.it is pleasing
to t be ear , friendly to die radio and as popular amongst
the elitist eino crowd as it is amongst the Live H)!> crowd.
Alter live years, the baud's long awaited and long overdue
lollow-up to HHMi's Tmkerton" is .» sell titled re< ord that
is intentionally similar to their first sell titled record in
both sound ,iud style. In .1 blatant visual parody ol their
own successful blue album from 19 ( .M, Wee/er's latest
switches the background coloi from solid blue to solid
green, while keeping the image ol the lour band mem
bers standing next to eat h other almost exa< tlv the same.
I he green album then changes "I've seen this be I ore"
into "I ve heard this belbrc" by 1 everting back to a more
leel good sound reminiscent ol (licit debut album, lca\
ing behind the darker, more introspcc live lyric sand tone
ol "I'inkerlon." which saw a drop in record sales and a
subsequent lengths touting hiatus.

I'here is ik> doubt ih.it Wee/er's l.iicsi will bring the
hand hat k into tin- limelight — and it serins as it their
|»<>| >iil.it it\ lias never waned .ill that iiiik li, .is witnessed by
llieii successful —but brief — stint on last summer's
V\ ,ii |>cd I our .md their consistently sold-out shows earli
ci this year during their Yahoo Outloud! tour. ()n the
green album, the 1 0 new songs .ill < l<x kin .it around three
minutes, and each track is as cati by .is tbe one that«omes
before it I be first song is "Don't Let Cio," a major-key,
mid tempo, verse * bonis-verse standard tli.it highlights
frontman Rivers Cuomo's shiny, upbe.it style ol song
writing tb.it made songs likt* "Undone" and "Ruddy
Molly übi(|iiitous MTV and commcrcial radio entities
seven years ago. (aiitar books and hackground-vtn al
"wboa-oh"s abound, not only on tbe first track, but
throughout the entire album. "Photograph" utilizes
hand-daps and "oh-baby"s to give it that Beach Hoys surf
rock feel, spooning out happy refrains like. "It's in the
photograph ol love. I be soon-to-be-a-singlc "Island In
I he Sun" is slower but by no means any less happy, with
its hev-hev 's, its Ict's-ruu-away-to-a-sunny-island motif
and the feel-good line ol the year during its harmony-in
fused chorus: "We'll never feel bad anymore."
(•one is the angst-ridden, broken-relationship lyricist
that Cuomo proved to be on "Pinkerton," an album
whose very song titles, like "Tired Of Sex" and "Why
Bother." seem to counteract and have been replaced by
the green album's optimistic mood swing of track names
like Smile and "(ilorious Day." I he green album's first
single, I l.isb Pipe, is almost the only new song tli.it cap
tures <i bit ol Pinkerton s darkness with its minor-key
driving rhythms and its dry chorus lyric, "You've got your
problems, I ve got my hash pipe." (lomplete with a music
video featuring instrument-wielding sumo wrestlers, its

radio overplay is almost assured, especially suit e it's the
first new Wee/.er single in so damn long. Km the truth ol
the mallei is that just about am ol these songs could be
smash hits. I'he main reason is bee ause, lot the most part,
the songs all have a similar feel to them, filled to the brim
with syrupy harmonies and guitar rills whose lu/zy dis
tortion is not distorted enough to ever sound dissonant.
I heir uncannily simplistic appeal almost soothingly co
erces the listener to forgive the- band lot produc ing such
infuriatingly infectious pop.
I'he thing is, no one can deny that Weezer's formula
works quite well, despite the familiar territory it covers,
(aiomo's songwriting may have had more depth on
"I'inkerton," but the green album does deliver healthy
amounts ol pop satisfaction, "(limine some love,
some love," Cuomo croons on the song "Simple Pages,"
and there is no doubt th.it millions of listeners will flock to
the tec orcl store to give VVee/er mad love. Bui < loc in
al .1 meager minutes, you would think the- band itself
< ould have shown a little more love to its finis tot having to
wait live years fora new release by including some more
new songs, which (hey have performed at shows, or al least
a couple of b sides. If you liked the blue album, then deli
niteh pick this up. II you don't like' songs with catchy
hooks and lyrics that stit kin void head all day, then stay
lar, lar away.
