# "Arabic Groove"
## World Music 
### Marisa Taylor, Contributing Writer 
When you listen to "Arabic (iroovc," lit* prepared to
bust out a spontaneous belly dance. Featuring the
sounds of funk, hip bop, R&B and (on temporary dance
beats from tbe Middle Fast and North Africa, this com
pilation by Putamayo World Music could very possibly
inspire you to get out your candles, spark up some in
(ense, dim the lights and shake it Arabic style.
Bands from Algeria, Kgypt, Morocco and Lebanon
are all represented on the album, with each track con
taining a provocative and interesting mixture of tradi
tional Middle Kastern instrumentation and melodic
palette with a more modern, dance-able beat and a blend
ol Irene hand Arabic lyric s.
In fact, the defining feature of "Arabic (iroove" is the
impossibility ol pigeonholing it into one category of
music, "l.eiley," for example, a tune by the Lebanese
band Dania, features beautiful simultaneous flute and
guitar melodies and what sounds like sitar solos layered
atop a hypnotic yet funky background dance beat.
Tonally, the song uses the melodic minor harmonies
and scales traditionally found in Middle Kastern music ,
but, paired with a contemporary dance groove, the song
becomes something entirely fascinating and ground
breaking in its creativity.
Other tracks feature cool African drum patterns,
twangy guitar melodies behind mournful vocals, c ate hv
disc o and hip-hop hybrid beats, c lull reggae and ska fla
vored grooves accented with sitar and other surprising
musical fusions that sound terrible on paper but blend
smoothly on the album. I he only weak spot on the (11)
was Putamayo's attempt at a pure hip-hop/ P funk track
â€” it sounded cheesy and tinny.
Overall, Putamayo World Music did an excellent
job bringing together an ama/ingly hybrid group of
music al styles. If you're looking for something differ
ent, exotic and filled to the brim with groove, 1 highly
recommend this (:i). It is completely addictive anel has
flavors and then some to satisfy even the pickiest of
appetites.
