# "The Invisible Man"
## Mark Eitzel 
### Jonah Hsu 
On his previous three solo albums, Mark Eitzel col
laborated with big names like James Mi New of Yo La
I'engo, Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth, Mike Mc(aeady of
Pearl |am and Peter Buck of RKM. but on his latest re
lease, " The Invisible Man," Kit/el goes it alone.
Kit/el wrote .ill the songs on the album on au
acoustic guitar and finished most of them with a sain
pier and pro-tools on a Mac (J-4 computer in the
front room of his house in San Francisco. "I worked
on 'The Invisible Man' for over two years, writing
ovci 10 songs and recording with a bunch of diflei
cut people, but mostly by myself," he said. I his has
to be hyperbole — because not one song on the
album is particularly good.

I lie first 12 tracks follow this formula: Loop three
electronic hooks, ensure that they are uninteresting, so
as not Ic»interfere with the vocals, vary and interrupt the
elec tronic tracks occasionally to keep the listener awake
and, lastly and most importantly, sing short, breathy
phrases that last two measures (always eight beats, .it
tli.it) at most.
I he first two steps of this formula are passable, given
high tolerance for mindless and directionless elec tron
ic music in the mainstream, but the third step is inex
cusable. Kit/el's vocals suck in every imaginable way.
First, there's not much melodic material you can
write to support (>() minutes of two-measure musical
phrases. I liink of the Stanford Improvisers's cotncdic
opera routine at house meeting, but drop the spon
taneity. Second, even il he could pen some arresting
melodies, he couldn't c arry those melodies, given his
monotonous voice.
Some may enjoy "The Invisible Man" as mood
inusit Some may find incredible earnestness in the last
track, "Proclaim Your Joy." But I say Kit/.el should have
stuck to the Americ an Music Club.
