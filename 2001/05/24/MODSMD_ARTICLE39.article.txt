# "The Red Thread"
## Arab Strap 
### Michael Baer, Staff Writer 
Arab Strap's new album, "The Red Thread," has
many fans, but, hard as I try, I can't count myself among
them. I he hardest records to review are ones I don't
like much. Such records are often just plain bad, and,
consequently, they're fun to trash. But, just as often,
such records can be interesting, thought-provoking
and — although you can't bear to spend too many min
utes at ;i time listening to them — they cannot be so eas
ily dismissed.

Such is the case with this Scottish duo's latest cre
ation. I heir music is relatively simple, yet also interest
ing and languid — not mere background music. It has
sounds th.it make it fas< inating — possibly even engag
ing — for those in a depressed mood. In (letter moods,
1 couldn't imagine listening to " The Red Thread" with
out falling asleep or, at the very least, taking it out of my
(il) player before the end of the album.
As for lyrics, lead singer Aid.in Moffat is heard
mumbling — rambling, really — about love and
sex <ind other things one might say after a few too
many nights alone. As such, it's depressing and a
tad pubescent.
Still, in the right mood, such poetry can be evo< ative
and heartfelt. "I low (.in nothing ever mean something?
/ It goes from white to gray so fast / A new pool on a
strange mattress/ I lelps me (at.ch up," Moffat sighs over
one or two somber guitars and a drum machine.
I here is also the telling. "11l could always be 18/And
you could always be eight / We'd draw monsters on your
walls / I'll keep you up too late," over slow, thundering
drums and similar guitar sounds to the previous song
— sounds that permeate most ol the album. It's hard
stuff t<» take much of the time, although it's perfect for
w hen you're in a mood in whit h you find the (aire to be
too cheery.
All in all, " The Red Thread" is an interesting album,
and it's helped me think about how best to judge a
record as good, bad or otherwise. Every time I've lis
tened to the album, I've had to cleanse myself afterward
with some Beatles, Rolling Stones, (inns 'n' Roses or
Public Enemy: Something fast and old instead of slow
and new.
Arab Strap has forced me to draw a line between
music that I like and music that I can disapprove of —
and I've determined that just outside that line falls "The
Red Thread."
