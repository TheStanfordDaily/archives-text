"Another Mellow Spring," the new album from
France's spongy trio, Mellow, is a testament to the power
<>! pop music drivel. What the album larks in horsepow
er, it makes up for with tingly, bubblit ious tracks that
moan and purr with chocolate-coated sonic energy.
Mellow is at its best when it fuses electronically en
hanced vocals and beats with solid, well orchestrated,
hook-laden pop melodies.
I lie opening track, "Simula Shi ma," is a prime exam
ple. Its slow, prolonged dose <>l poptronic babble is re
plete with ( Imps twinkles and placid guitar noise that
sensualh throb through the airspace. Similarly, "l.oveh
Light" features .1 psychedelic , bipolar melock infused
with deep, pounding drums ili.it give \va\ to ele< ironi
cally distorted vocals.
"Mellow (Organic version)" gurgles and chatters
with a variety of garbled sounds that are am bored In .1
lluid, looped beat tli.it fades in and out and tnoi phs into
a mechanical, increasingly spasmodic, pen ussive mosa
ic ol noise.
Where Mellow tends to fall short is with its attempts .it
bare-breasted pop music. Although "Sun Dam e" involves
enough spat v, loopv electronic babblings to make it bear
able, "lust.ml Love" features Beatles-influenced horns
likened to those on "Sergeant Pepper's I.onel\ Hearts
(Hub" — sounds that were witty three decades ago. but
are rather tedious today.
However, "Paris Sous La Neige," despite its sterile
pop meloch and congenial Ivrics ("Do you think I'm
going to get some blight new girls/ Do \oii think I'll be .1
rich man / Do you think I'm going to score"), is surpris
ingly simpatico.

Mellow's "Another Mellow Spring" has been harvest
ed before its time. I ra< ks on this album are basically hit
or-miss, but those like "Another Mellow Winter," wilh its
blithe, subaqueous, analog-meets-digital sonic fusion,
or "Shinda Shima" lend credence to the assertion that
Mellow's musical evolution is not unfeasible — it's just
premature.


They call me mellow yellow, but I prefer to be called Shante
