# "The Dream of a Modern Day"
## Mahogany 
### Sarah Mearon, Editorial Staff 
I .ike .1 moist first kiss under the stars. Mahogany's "The
1 )reain ola Modern I)ay" provokes dreamy, ethereal feel
ings that you teel as a flutter in your stomach and as a tick
le in. well, somewhere else.
I he complexly layered, densely symphonic sound on
much ol the album is reminiscent of the sonant y of
Stereolab's epic " I lie Flower (ialled Nowhere" from its
MM)7 "Dots and Loops" album.
I he vocals on "Dream" are fresh in th.it. instead of
manifesting as distinct components ol the tracks, they
are capably synthesized with the blissful instrumental
Inundation found throughout the album.
Ihe simplistic, girlish vocals on "Chance" seem to
float and bob on the waves ol consonant electronic
melodies and neither alter, nor detract, from their fervor
and intensity.

The keystone track on the album, "Optimism," fea
tures wistfully saccharine vocals propelled by a frenetic
backbe.it infused with tic klish, electronic flickers. I lie
track becomes progressively orgasmic as two voices
chant the word "dynamically" with emphasis on the
wrong syllables, making the song so much more inven
tive and satiating.
The epic "Soleil Radieux" is a hill-bodied, melodic
contest between slow, sweet vocals and a rousing barrage
of percussion. "Vista-Dome" is anchored by heartbeat
like pulsations and features wistful guitar strumming
and high-pitched vocals that quiver in and out of sonic
consciousness.
The romantically illuminating "The Dream of a Mod
ern Day" is a consummate fusion of luscious vocalism and
elaborate orchestral meditations that weep sonic sensual
ism. So close your eyes and submerge your subconscious
in Mahogany.


Purple transluscent marigolds toppling backward like sanguine
syrupy solipsism suspended by turtles, dripping transmission
fluid onto tne pulsating populace of plurality, while your perni
cious perspicacity dribbles into endless florid tangents.
