He lias produced several albums ol

Bright Eyes is currently supporting
Fevers and Mirrors" on a European tour.

followed by several one-oil United States
dates. Before donor's show in Berlin on
May 17, I spoke with him, sitting cross
legged on a halt onv overlooking pieces ot
the former Berlin Wall.
I've noticed that your music is fairly lyri
cally heavy. Did you write poetry before
you wrote music?
Yes, I think I've written poetry and
short stories the whole time I have written
songs, but I haven't devoted enough time
to it. I don't have any confidence in it. so I
don't show it to anyone, ever. < >nc of my
older brothers is a great writer. I le went to
graduate school lor writing. There are a
1011 pie other friends of mine that 111 show
still I to. but — I don't know — it takes such
diligent etobe a writer. 11 doesn't tome as
naturalK to me as songwriting.
That's why you choose to write songs
instead?
I guess. I still write, and I'd love to be a
writer — a real writer. I don't know il I
ha\ e what it lakes.
What do you think about the difference
in audiences for short stories or novels
and music?
I bete aie similarities, but there are
also worlds of differences I 01 one. musit
I think is — I don't want to sa\ it's easict
lo understand but 11 seems more read
il\ available to people ol all ages and
walks of life. \lu sit seems a little more at
ccssihle to a 10111111011 person. Obviously,
anvonc who s literate ( an read a book, hut

n 11Ist1st seems like listening to records and
going (<> see hands is a little easier, espe
cially lor young people, to get into, |usi
hec ause ii seems more leisurely than pit k

ing up a book.
Do you think the fact that music appeals
to a younger and a broader spectium of
people adds or detracts from its value?
Once again, I think there are positives
and negatives to it. I think it's cool when
young kids get into the music I make — a
freshman or sophomore in high school
coming up and being super excited about
your band, lo me. its a better compliment
than coming from someone who's a jaded
semester who's listened to all these bands
and has opinions about everything. It

seems more pure.
Music made me lee! so good .it
points in inv lite when nothing
else made me feel good, so I like
to think of doing that for other
people. But I guess hooks do
tli.it. too. It's .t good question.
I'm (list rambling. I'm not even
answering voui questions. I'm
11ist rephrasing them.
I'm asking some of these ques
tions beeause they're the ones
on my mind right now. I figured
it would be interesting to hear
your point of view on them.
I hat's ,i good 1 eason to .isk
Sometimes I worry that it's diffi
cult to compete with the indus
try that just puts out a lot of
crap. And here you are putting
out something that has a lot of
depth. Your music is sort of like
a novel, the way it's layered.
Ilow do you feel about having to
compete with industry? You
want more people to have access
to your work, hut you don't want
to compromise.
Its something tli.it I still
struggle with. I tn m\ best to not
let it ailed the wav I write. I
don't write things on put pose
that I know people will like, hut.

.iloiis; those same lines. I don't stop myself'
when I have a catchy melod\ that I like,
hut 1 know it's cat( hy in mavhe a conven
tional way. A part of me is always like.
"Don't do that." hnt I think it's sinpid. I've
alwavs written music the wa\ I like it and
how it comes ont.
I think the best tiling to do is to disre
gard the audience to a certain degree and
write not necessarily stricth lor voursell
hut what you enjoy, and, in doing that,
you will certainly reach some segment of
the population that is like minded to vou
and vour tastes. As an artist, I think that's
all you can do. Vou can't write lor other
people. Did I not answer yout question
again? (()het st grabs my sheet of <|iiest ions
and reads them to himself). What number
are we on?
They're not really in order. I lost iny
place! I don't know — I'm still strug
gling with the idea of competing against
the industry.
Well, the way we deal with that, in
America, it's our friend's label that puts
out the music, so we are in total control.
Saddle Cat ek is a label we started .is kids.
Me and inv group of friends, we all plaved
in bands and it started out real small with

cassettes and seven-inches. Now it's a real
company, but, at the same time, it's still
just us putting out our friends' music
purely for the love of music.
We've learned to be smart enough to
where we are making money off of it,
which helps us to continue making more
music. We have a publishing deal, and it
doesn't affect anything we do. Basically,
they take vour music and try to make more
money oil Ol it by getting it into films and
commercials, but, the way it's worked out,
they can't seem to sell a single one of our
songs to anyone.

You have the deal with Sony?
Yeah. Ii doesn't ailed anything as far as
the actual records. It's still all on Saddle
('.reek. I'm verv fortunate that I don't have
to deal with that stull. I was in another
hand when I was in high school, and we
signed onto a label and that taught me a
lot about how it's horribly messv. We've
turned down lots of deals where we could
have made a lot ol mone\ up front, but the
things we would have lost in return
wouldn't have been worth it.
So you never plan on signing onto a
major label?
It's hard to say never, but 1 don't
think anytime soon, and maybe never.
And, over here, we've lucked out In
meeting these great guys who run this
label t ailed Wichita in Kngland. 1 total
ly trust them because I know what
thev're in it lor. It's not to make money.
(>ne of the guvs in there right now is this
guv, Dick (ireen, who is really high up
at ('.reation Records, which put out I he
Stniths's "My Bloody Valentine." He's
made all the money that he needs to
make, and now he's running this label
exactly how he wants to do it. He still


Pimpin' it like a young Tony Hawk


Yeah, the Manville Band rocks.
wants to be involved in music,
hut he doesn't want to <lc-.il with
any oi the bullshit.
It's not hig si ale, vvlut li is per
fect for tis. I think for .1 lot of peo
ple that get involved with la
bels, it (.111 damage what you're
doing. II you don't think it will,
even if you think you will he the
exception to the rule, it almost al
ways does. Kvery one of my
friends who has signed to a major
lal»el has thoroughh regretted 11
later on. I used to he more ideal
istic and radical about it. hut,
now, it just seems practical. It
would have been a disaster il we
had signed.
How do you then define suc
cess, and what do you want
from your music?
I just want to keep making
something tli.it I find (|iialit\ in.
With even thing I've ever done. I
have regrets about il. At the same
time, I can stand behind 11. I did
the best I could, and I w.is doing
it fora pure reason. I hope I < an
continue to do th.it. Right now,
I'm making a living as a musician.
< )nly dm mg the la si nine mouths
could I say. "I'm a music ian
that swliat I do. It's somcthinu I

never thought would happen. I
hope it keeps going so I don't
have to get a joh.
At the same time, I'm not
willing to change anything 111
order to make sure it happens.
I'm not scared of going back to

c ollege. It's Inn and all to
do this, but I keep in
niuicl that what's hip and
interesting one minute is
not going to be the next
minute. I don't necessar
ily feel like I'm going to
be able to do this fora liv
ing forever. I'll always
make music . but not nec
essarilv on this level.
Is there anything else you
would want to do, since
you are still so young?
It would be aina/ing
to write .1 book. I've
thought about teat lung.
My mom's an elemen
tal sc hctol pi me ipal.
and that seems like .1
pi ett\ good thing to clo.
I could go Ikmie feeling
piett\ good about 111 v
scll doing something
like that.

Why do you keep a sliding line
up of musicians in your band?
It's nice in .11w.i\ s have new in
terpretations ot the songs, and it's
nice to alwa\s travel with new
people.

Do you feel like, if you found the
right people, you would want to
have a solid hand?
I think for Bright Kyes it
makes sense to keep it this way
because it keeps the locus on the
song. I always want it to be about

the I've been in bands, and
1 .1111 in otliei hands now.
I saw you play with Azure Ray
in San Francisco. Is this a sis
ter band?
Yeah, I love them — as people.
I love their record. I love everv

thing about them. Andy — one of
the guys who's playing tonight —
he lives in Athens, and he's got a
band called Now It's Overhead
with Maria and Orenda. Saddle
Creek is going to put that out
next year. And we're going to put
out an KP lor Azure Ray, too. ()l
all the lours and bands, that was
one of my favorites. And I got to
play an A/.lire Ray song. That was
a dream come true.
How did you meet them?
Through friends. They're the
type o! people that, immediately
upon meeting them, I felt some
thing. I could easily I.ill in love with
either one ol them, other than the
la< t that there are two ol tlicm and
so you can't ever pick one.
What would you say most drives
your music?
I just have to write to leel good
or really to feel normal. I learned
that when I was about 12, and as
soon as I learned that I never
stopped writing. Music has be
cotne the easiest and best way to
release a certain part ol yourself
\on know how it is It's more of
a need, more than it is a desire to
succeed in a hand.
I've noticed in your lyrics that
you write a lot about confronting
meaninglessness. In writing
your music, is it a dependency,
how you get your feelings out, or

is there something about musie
and art that drives you to do it?
It's both. I am such a scatter
brained person. I can never make
sense of myself, and the only time I
ever feel like I'm having clarity
with what I'm thinking is when I
put it into music. Finishing a song
is the best feeling. It's like, "Wow, I
really do make sense to myself." So
much of the time, I just walk
around confused.
Why did you choose the name
Bright Eyes?
I was staying up real late one
night watching Turner Movie
('.lassies. I can't remember the
name of the movie, but the main
Humphrey Bogart-type dude
kept calling the girl "bright eyes"
— a term of endearment.
How has wandering around the
country affected who you are?
It's made me really appreci
ate mv home. The big joke
about living in Nebraska is that
everyone's trving l<> leave. Kver
since I started traveling, I real
ized there's no place like home.
Ihe <>nl\ place I've slightly
thought about moving to is
Athens. It's a lot like Omaha,
but I don't have as manv dose
friends. It's made me realize
that, no matter where von go,
everywhere is kind ol the same
and evervone is kind of the
same. It's a comforting feeling.
