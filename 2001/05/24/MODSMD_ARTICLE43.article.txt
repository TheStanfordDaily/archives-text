# Blurring the line between fantasy and reality
## Science fiction author Terry Pratchett on nuclear meltdowns and 'The Truth' 
### EALASAID A. HAAS 
"Signing tours," says Terry Pratt li
cit, "are (lie weirdest way to spend
your time since they outlawed bob
bing lor piranhas!"
Me should know. The British-born
Pratchett, author of more than !i() hooks,
spends about three months a year on tour,
promoting his novels.
Pratchett is currently on tour to pro
mote his newest book, "The Thief

<>l I ime." I .ike most ofhis novels,
it takes place on Discworld, .1
world that is fl.it like a pizza and
carried through space on the
lu<ks ol four giant elephants,
who stand on the hack of a gar
gantuan turtle. On Discworld,
things are different from the way
ihe\ are here. Magic is real, belief
1 c.ilb ( <111 move mountains and
time is something yon can hend
— il vou know how to do it.
I nlike the works of many pop
ular fantasy writers today,
I'rati belt's books are not in the
Ibrin of .m epic series. Although
the\ are looselv strung together
in .1 more or less common time
line, the\ follow different groups
of characters on Disc world and
often have wildh different forms.
"Wyrd Sisters" is a sort of
"Macbeth" parody in which the
wiu lies have attitude, "(>uards!
(in.uds!" is a fairly straightfor
ward thriller novel. "Moving Pic
tures" satiri/es Hollywood, and
" Feet of (Hay" is an almost In-the
book mystery.
l lie fantasy background for
Pi at( belt's novels is just scenery:
a setting that allows for far more
creative freedom than the mod-

ern world.
In" I he Chief of'Ciine," .1 young man is
hired lo huild the per fee I dock — out* that
will measure the "Universal rick." Unlor
tunately. the last time someone did that, it
nearly ended the world by stopping time
Ibrever. 1 lie History Monks, who move
time from places ii isn't needed — like the
bottom ol the ocean — to places it's des
perately wanted — like the cit\ — have to
stop this man before he finishes building
the clock.
A couple of weeks ago, at an interview
and book-signing event in Berkelcv,
Terry Pratchett spoke about his somewhat
surreal life before becoming a full-time
novelist, the peculiarities of being .1 wildly
successful lantasv novelist in Kngland and
what is coming up in his career.
" I he Truth," which preceded "The
Chief of lime" in the Disc world series, is
the story of the first newspaper on the
planet. Young scribe William l)e Worde
becomes editor of the Ankh-Morpork
I lines and then has to deal with irritated
city officials, suspicious guardsmen and
the public clamor for exciting news. Plus,
his only photographer is <1 vampire who is
often incinerated by bis own flashbulbs.

flic book is at once cynical and en
gaging, and it rings very true, hi writing
"The Truth," Pratchett undoubtedly
benefited from working as a journalist
(or several years after completing his
schooling, lit- started out as a reporter
and gradually moved up to feature arti
cles and then to editing.
"()h, 'l he Truth' is completely autobi
ographical," lit* said. "I mean, obviously I
never met vampires, but, I mean, Friday,

I was at school, and by Monday, I was at
work. I was this spotty, Ipimply] kid!
I hey gave me training, .is they amusing
ly say, on the job."
lie laughed. "There I was, 17 years
old, still wet behind the ears, and they
gave mi' a notebook and .1 pencil and just
pushed me out on the street. And I was
covering all these things! I learned from
really good guys. too. Most of what we
would call regional newspapers always
| have] one or two guys who have worked
on hum h bigger newspapers. They're
not exactlv retired, but they come back
to work 011 smaller ones, where they'd be
the news editor or something. I liev'vc
been there and done th.it and seen it all."
"You pick up a lot of your ( raft as .111
apprentice," Pratt licit said. " Hut the real
test is if you could complete the week with
out getting the paper into serious legal
shit."
"That's why." he said, growing seri
ous, "I get pissed off when people call
themselves journalists. I say, 'How
come you're a journalist?' |And they
sayj, 'Well, I run a Webzine,' or, 'Well,
hev, I'm a journalist because I can do
150 words a minute shorthand. 1 got 07

in (lie law-relating-to-journalism exam,
plus various other qualifications.' "
"I've sat there for years and hacked
peoples' copy about and had my copy
hacked ahout, and I've done the whole
tiling with the foot in the door, the
whole hit. I .1111 a journalist. So some
times 1 feel like some hat tie-scarred
Vietnam veteran when someone |says]
they're .1 soldier."
"Anyway, it was a lot of fun, and it was
very good training to he .1 writer. But it
was awful training to he .1 literary writer
because ii was a heavy dose of real life,
wim h, <»n the whole, liter.irv writers don't
want, but it w.is very, vet \ good training to
be a popular writer."
Aftet liis days as .1 reporter, I'ratchett
worked as a public relations ofl'u et lot the
power company in Kngland .111< 1 Wales.
His region had, among 20 or so power
plants, three nuclear-generating sites that
provided most of the hassle he had to deal
with in his job.
" I his may disappoint you." lie said,
"but the things I remember aren't tin- big
tilings We didn't really have anvthing like
.1 serious mule.ll accident. It was the
weird shit, like .1 gn\ tinning up on .111
open day who tested up too radioactive to
be allowed into the nucleai powet station.
You couldn't let him in because, if von let
him in .ind lie was radioactive, \oii
c ouldn't let liitu out."
"M\ job was to sa\. Radiation? We
didn't leak anv tadiation! Well, okay,
itiavhe it was a little- hit of radiation. Look.

you couldn't even see it!' I had some fun
times. I can assure you."
"I find it easy to talk to people. Why?
Because, when you have spent a large part
of your life being phoned at 4:30 in the
morning by the manager of a nuclear
power station saying, 'You'll laugh when
you hear what's happened this time,'
there is not a whole lot that's going to
phase you."

"The manager of one <>i the nuclear
power stations phoned up and said,
'You'll laugh when ...' and I said, 'No, no,
I won't laugh fell me what's happened.'
Ile said,' I have to make certain you know
the background details to this. You know
that when we get the spent fuel from our
station, it goes fby train] to a place lor re
processing. These trains all go to a mar
shaling yard in (>loucester, where they are
shunted together into one long train and
oil it goes. While thev were being shunted,
two wheels on one ol the trains came oil at
the points.' "
"I said, 'Are you telling me that the ac
tual train overturned?' lie said. 'No. it
jumped the points. I "lie train is there,
across the points, and everything is up
right. I nlcss you gel up to it. you ( an t see
what's happened. Iwo ol the wheels are
oil the i.iils. Are \on with me so far?' "
"I said, 'Yes. I think so. I le said, '(lood,
bet .uise, as we speak, a man .it British Rail
has opened .1 hook ol rules and is finding
thai this .u mail\ counts as a 1.1 i 1 \\. 1 \ acci
dent. He is now turning to the next hook
ol Miles. What is this train carrying? Ah!
Nucleat luel. So he now turns to the sec
tion on railway accidents involving nu
(le.tr fuel. And. even .in we spe.tk. his lin
get is running down to the hit where it

"And. while they were going on inter

"The\ asked, 'What are you doing?
'Well, we put it hack on the rails, and it's
gone.' 'But it's a nuclear ac< idem!' 'No. it
isn't!' It took us days and days to deal with
that."
With such a peculiar background, it is
hardly surprising that Prate belt's books
aren't just fantasy novels but are rather
surreal. Kven so, Pratchett has had 'J'J of
his books at No. I on the bestseller lists in
the United kingdom. However, unlike in
the United States, science lit lion and fan
tasy novels are virtually ignored in the
United Kingdom, so Pralchett's bestseller
status is hardly alluded to.
"111 the U.K.," Pratchett said, "about
one fiction book in 10 is science fiction.
You wouldn't know it from the book
shops. I he science fit tion sc< tion tends to
be treated like <1 sexually transmitted dis
ease. In fact, one hook shop manager said
to me when 1 discussed it with hiin, 'Well,
the people interested will know where to
find it.' "
"Some six months ago, when "I he

Ihe door and I suddenly
realized that mv book
was not there. I asked
why, and, with great and
disarming honesty, the
owner said, 'Well, you're
not exactly bestseller ma
terial. are you?' "
As tunny as Pratt bet t's
books are, they are not
without their serious
sides. Perhaps the best
example of this is "Small
Gods." It follows the tri
als and tribulations of a
man named Brutha,
who is chosen as the
prophet of a god in

whom 110 one else believes.
I be god, ()m, lias been
around lot centuries, but, in
Omnia, everyone believes 111
the ( hut( h — whi< b is .1 real
ly, really nasty version of the
(lathoiic church at the time of
the Inquisition — rather than
111 the god himself.
With Mrutha as bis oul\ true
believer, ()tn is virtuallx power
less. and Hrutha must figure
out a win to help people believe
again. I lus is a philosophical
rather than a straight-out
comedit novel, although there
are moments in it that do con
tain humor.
"I think that, 111 order to
stand the test of time, the books
ought to work even if there
were no funny parts to them at
all," Prate hett said.
"I've also learned that the
humor ought to evolve from
the plot rather than being — as
it were — surgically inserted.
Gomedy and tragedy are only
two sides of the same coin, they
say. I would prefer to say that
comedy is tragedy happening
to somebody else. In fact, the
book which got a mixed recep
tion from the fans when it came
out was 'Small Gods,' and, yet,
subsequently, it's the one I've
had the most mail about and
some of the most thoughtful
mail about. There's large, large
parts of' Small Gods' which are

not tunny.
I'ratchett has just
(ompleted "The
Ania/ing Maurice
and liis Kducated
Rodents," .1 chil
dren's book set on
Discworld. "It start
ed out a bit jolly, a lit
tle romp, and
|turned into] sort of
death and destruc
tion and poisoning
and desperate war
fare — just the tiling
for kids," he said.
"Actually, it's really
cool."
Further ahead,
two of I'ratchett's
no t) -1) iscw o 1 1 d
books are iu the
process of being

made into films, "Good Omens."
an apocalyptic tale co-authored
with Neil (»aiman, may he direct
ed by "Monty Python" alumnus
ferry Gilliam. The True kers tril
ogy ("Truckers," "Diggers" and
"Wings"), a fantasy series for
young readers, has been bought
by Dream Works to be made into
a computer-generated film along
the lines of "Shrek."
Pratchett says he is enthusi
astic about both projects, say
ing that "a bad 'Good Omens'
made by Terry Gilliam would
be better than a good one
made by anyone else" and

thai In- is highly impressed by
Dream Works. I'hey screened
"Shrek" for him to give him a
feel for what the "Truckers"
film might look like, and his
response to it was."In your
humorous patois, it's cool —
possibly even awesome."
Discworld fans have nothing
to fear, however. Pratchett is in
the process of putting together
a three-book Discworld con
tract, and he says that he has a
number of plots in mind to
work with. "Yeah, I could easi
ly do three more books I want
to do."


"Thief of Time" is Pratchett's most recent book
in the Discworld series.


"Where's your other hand?" "Between two
pillows."
