# Stanford Film Society's '2001: A Cinematic Odyssey'
## Film Festival a welcome outlet for ambitious student filmmakers 
### ENO SARRIS STAFF WRITER 
I'he cinematic scene at Stan
lord is alive and kicking. At
least ii was last Friday and Sat
urday evenings, when the Stan
lord Film Society held its
fourth annual Student Film
Festival. Both the sheer num
ber ol movies as well as their
relative diversity were impres
sive on a campus tli.it hasn't
been especially supportive of
the film medium. I lie lack of
an undergraduate film studies
or film production major serves
.is a glaring example of Stan
ford's failure to support a
whole ( lass of artists.
1 be 2 ( .> directors bad t<> be
resilient to produce their
works ol art. Beth Robi
nowit/. a senior majoring in
science, technology and s<» i
et\ and one ol the founding
members of the Undergradu
ate Film Workshop and the
Stanford Film Society, said
that making a film while being
a student here was much "like
war." I be often laborious
editing process is bard when
you are also completing a nor
mal academic load, she said.
).!< Ob Klein, a junior majoring
in symbolic systems and the di
rector of "Finger Fu," said he
agreed with Robinowit/.'s assess
ment of the filming process.
"You have to be a hustler," he

said, "You have to lit', cheat and
steal to be filmmaker here." Co
ordinating the cast's different
schedules with those of the
equipment, as well as getting the
weather in each location right, is
a daunting task, especially il
you've got hours of coding to

sai)(l\vi< ii in between shoots.
Mis reward, though, was the
crowd's ram ous approval of Ii is
karate comedy, starring senior
Danny Jacobs as Niehow, a
Stanford student hung up on
his master's teachings. Klein
had no doubts about the worth

of working for almost two quar
ters on a project for which he
will receive no academic credit.
"1 learned a lot about myself,
my friends, about equipment
and about Stanford," he said,
adding the last with a smile.
Many filmmakers at the festi-

val joined Klein in thanking the
members <>l the film sot iely lor
their help. Klein said he felt
that Robinowit/. w.is a "great
producer" th.it helped create
"a feeling of community among
.ill the people making films,"
while Ryan Lohbauer thanked

Mark Ylurra, a founding mem
ber ol the Undergraduate Film
Workshop and a tt*acln*r m (lit*
workshop this year, lor his
"tough love."
Sometimes the filmmakers
just needed to he (old to get
on with it. Sometimes the
filmmakers ha rely got it to
gether in time— I ravis Kopp
and Alan Kaiser read tlicit
credits as their liot-oH I lie
presses film, "I'ruliock," was
rushed to tlu* anditorinm.
I licit adaptation ol the I S.
Fliot poem was still one ol the
highlights <>l the festival in its
unassuming simplu it v.
hut almost all <>l the direc
tors tli.it set out to make a film
persevered, and the crowd was
applet iative hotli nights. I o he
fair, sometimes the shouts
seemed to he filled with < .ills 01.
" Chat's m\ hov." from sections
ol friends of the filmmakers,
hut these were ,ilso the people
th.it starred in. supported ;md
helped ( rcatt* inan\ ol the films
they were watching.
Lila de la Chcsnaye, while
making "act'.()M IWNniinent,"
enlisted the help ol her friends
in every part of the process.
She said in her remarks that it
was Inn "watching her friends
try to act like exaggerated ver
sions of them selves." I'll is com
ing together of friends also
served many of the movies well
hy allowing the filmmakers to

c oncentrate on I lit* visual ele
ments of the films while dele
gating the mnsieal elements to
a friend.
"Abort ive," Antonio
Bowens's abstract movie delv
ing into the relationship be
tween I lie dream world and re
ality, benefited immensely
from bis collaboration with se
nior music major Anthony
Ralomas. Kalomas, a.k.a.
Dionysus, contributed a jungle
track ib.it meshed incredibh
with the visual chaos ol
Bowens's c amera work.
Arc adia, an on-campus band,
did the same fin* Brady Beauhi
en's "Mentality" with some me
andering indie pop, while Jell
Byron helped till out (
Montegut's drcatm "Blue" with
bis work on the music and
sound effects.
Ryan Lohbauer's film,
"Mitno Pops: An Artist" took
the moc k-uinentarv approach
and succeeded 111 being both
smart and funny. Cindy Daig
n.iult's » harac ter piece, "Bi ic-.'
aiul Nathan folkert's "Knock,
Knew k" were hilarious.
All in .ill, this was a beautiful
Student 112 ilm festival. I lope
fully, next year you will be
showing something. ()r at least
helping a friend show some
thing. Or at least coming and
c beering for your friends as
they show something. At the
very least, go.


Guys, guys! You're in my shot!
