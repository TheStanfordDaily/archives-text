"Pearl Harbor," probably the
most anticipated movie of the
year, w ill hit theaters in less than
24 hours. Consider that — and
the fact that Memorial Day
weekend traditionally sweeps
em in at the box oflice — and we
conld very well see long lines of
people congregating around the
local multiplexes as early as Fri-

day afternoon.

Furthermore, consider that

Pearl Harbor" appeals to

almost all ages of view
ers. The last movie that
garnered such appeal

was "Titanic," which
sailed on and on
until it became the

highest grossing
film of all time.
(iuys will want to
see "Pearl Harbor"
lor the hig, blasting

action scenes, (iirls
will want to see it for

the hig. blasting love
scenes. Who can ignore

that highly promoted

love triangle between the

characters played by Ben Affleck

Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckin
sale? I hen add to the mix a lot of

senior citizens, perhaps the hard

est crowd to gather, who will want
to see "Pearl 11 arbor" lor its histor-

ical value. Al
though I'm

guessing
that news
stories will
sweep the
nation in
the next
couple of"
days about

the factual ili
ac euracies

that
pla g u e
the film.

From the looks of things, view
ers seem particularly anxious to
bite the l>ig bullet when it ( onies to
special effects extravaganzas this
summer. A couple of weeks ago,
" The Mummy Returns" opened
with a whopping, near-$7() mil
lion weekend debut. That's mon
ster-sized, since no other movie
started out with such an extraordi
nary early return .it the box office
last year. As for "Pearl Harbor,"
some insiders predict that it will
sei a box ollice record of its own
this weekend

And — pardon the stereotype
— but the Bay Area crowd is usu
ally rather compulsive when it
comes to getting the first look at
something. I mean, imagine the
horror — the shame, even — of at
tending an upscale party in a San

Francisco suburb without seeing
"Pearl Harbor" on opening week
end. Everyone from the third but
ler to the pastry chef will have seen
the movie.
The hostess will probably start
a long-winded conversation
about the love scenes. 1 lie host
will probably start a long-winded
conversation about the amazing
special eflects. And people don't
like to be left out: They want to
caU h wind of something when it's
new. They want to see movies like
this early.
