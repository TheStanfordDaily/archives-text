agree. It's too had that the studio didn't

al the same lime, an enigma. I le's se( relive
and silent, but we accept his actions, al
though we don't always understand his in
tentions. I he real sui pi ise, however, is Jen

liift'r Lope/.. She's strong and sweet and
builds on-screen chemistry with her lead
ing man that threads through the story
line Irom beginning to end.
I had lbrgotten how likeable Lope/
could be. In "Selena," her breakthrough
pei lot niance. she brought .in astonishing
presence to the lile ol the late Litina
singer. And she was nice and nimble in
Steven Soderbergh's "Out ol Sight. But
somewhere along the line, with movies
like "The ( ell. "Anaconda' and — worst
of all — "'llie Wedding Planner." I lost
faith in her.
With "Angel Kves. she emerges once

ble ol competing with the likes ol San-

<lra liullock .iihl
Rriicc Zellwegger.
(I'd th row Julia
Roberts into 11 ic list,
but she's still in <1
league of her own).
"Angel Eyes"
works because it
feeds off Sharon
and (latch's rela
tionship and
doesn't get bogged
d<iwn with too many
details. Even
Sharon's struggle to
reunite with her es
tranged lather,
which seems like a
contrived subplot,
actually fits into the
story.

1 wo weeks ago,
I attacked I lie "Angel Kves" theatrical
trailer lor giving .iw;i\ too much o! 11 it'
movie. Now that I have seen "Angel
Eyes," I still sax that the trailer gives
awav too much — hut too much ola dif
ferent movie. Some might call it mis
leading advertising, and I'm inclined to
agree. It's too had that the studio didn't
have the courage to sell the film for what
it is. I lere's a movie that doesn't rely on
cheap thrills or ( hills. hut takes its char
acters .it face value and lets them grow
in front of our e\ rs.


I'm a tough cop.


But I'm also a sensitive girl.
