Lti/hin's tormented mental state and
the scheming of his former mentor,
Valcntino\ (Smart Wilson), who plots
to psvt hologit alh torment Luzhin
into losing the tournament.
St\list it allv, "The l.uz.hin I K lein e"
is top-not( h. reinloK ing on multiple
levels the idea that chess dominates
Lii/.hin's lile and sanity. Smart art di
rection confines the actors inside gi
gantic chessboard-like sets; tlie block
ing turns the actors into chess pieces
In keeping them motionless in geo
metric formations until their cues.
Kven the film's tempo mimics that of
a chess game — a leisurely develop
ment punctuated by periods ol in
tense action.
I hroiigh these clever stylistic deci
sions and the fine acting of the two
leads, " Ihe Ln/.hin Defence" suc-

ceeds. fnrtnrro is per
le( ilv quirkv, (juietly
mastic ating scenery and
suffering nervous
breakdowns. Watson
shines too, despite hei
understated role.
It is the script that
sabotages the film. I lie
narrative and charac
terization — which
ought to be as tightly
plotted as a chess matt h
— are disjointed and as
loose as a game of Pick
Up Stix.
Valentinov is such a
cartoonish villain that
one half expects him to

Ih> holding .1 pinky to his
lips. I he film never explains his intense ha
tred <>l l.ii/hin or why he feels the need to
sabotage lite game ola player he claims will
lose anvway. 1 he other ( haraeters don't fare
much better, ranging from stock roles to ex
position providers.
I will say that the film sucker-punches
vou. You marvel at the opulent production
values and brilliant stylistic decisions ren
dering the film into a gigantic chess game.
You watch I urturro and Watson's expert
perlbrinances, and you force yourself to be
lieve you're watching a good movie, reason
ing th.it you must be just too lowbrow and

uncultured for this art house film.
And you would be wrong. Don't let em
push you around. Think about the stock
characters, weak script and incoherent
bat kstory. You may admire the film's bril
liant cinematic design and Turturro and
Watson's excellent acting, but stop there,
and recognize that "The Luzliin Defence"
is at heart an ornate, exquisite chessboard
11 set I to play only the most basic and ama
teurish ol games.


King me.


Thaf sit — you're both going to your rooms without dinner.
