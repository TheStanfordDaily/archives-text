Christopher Dining— 1 larvard-edu

chaii of tlit' (tillianl playwrighting pro
gram— has credentials that suggest are
lined sensibility and a highbrow approach
to theater. Yet Durang's pla\s are looseh
told tables, filled with the viilg.u luunor ol
evei \d,i\ vernacular — qualities that allow
(1111( s to dismiss his work .is perhaps a bit
too pedestrian, a bit too unstriulured. Du
i ang's greatest strength, il an\. is the s.ilii
ii insouciance with which lie spears his
many targets: No topic is taboo and no one
is s.iie Irom his barbs. "Betty s Summer
Vacation," currently playing in the co/\
shoebox of the Actors 1 heatre of San
Francisco, confirms Durang's talent for
debaut lied and debased dialogue. I he
niatically, too, the pla\ follows suit as a
thinh veiled attack on our I V society and
oui insatiable appetite for blood lust.
I he protagonist, Betty, is the perfect
"straight man" fora cast full of deviants

and eccentrics. Dressed in pigtails and
played with a self-righteous, Midwestern

moralitN. Bettv arrives .it a New
area summer time-share onl\ to find il in
lested w ilh freaks: 1 rudv, who cannot
seem to shut-up; Mrs. Sieztnagrafl. a let h
eroiis vvidow who doesn't seem to mind
I rudv, liei daughter, being molested <n
raped; Keith, .i shovel-toting sociopath
who likes to ( hop people up; Bu< k, the
hormonall\-charged stud who is willing
to mount anvone or anything; and Mr.
Vanislaw, an exhibitionist who struts his
stiifl at every possibility
F.ven strangei are the whining, eerib
harmonious voices, coming from the ceil
ing that provide a running commentary
on the play. At first, the voites act as an in
no( iioiis laugh-lrat k, which, sure enough,
spurs the audience to laughtet But .is the
pl.iv degenerates into lurid murders,
rapes and Lorena Bobbitt-style amputa
tions, the laughter becomes horribly inap
propriate. Soon, the voices make petulant
demands — "Entertain us! (.ratify us
now!" — that, when unheeded, force the
voices to take the reins of the play and pro
pel the cast towards a Court I V ending.

I found the voices mosi interesting
when lhe\ appeared to reflect — and
mot k — the andient e's inner monologue.
But as soon as n was < leat" thai the voices
represented that mosi despicable stratum
of soi ict\ — the I \ talk-show addict — ii
«as a little too eas\ to join in Durang's
satirii attacks. Alter all. .is cultured and
cosmopolitan theater-goers, we couldn't
possihh worship the lurid and salacious
tabloid material like these people. Right?
Satirizing the excesses of I V and out
silh, media-saturated society is not really
.in original endeavoi Almost am episode
of "I he Simpsons' destroys whatever
claim Dm.tug might have had to doing
something novel. Bui to see this sort of
satire performed by real people, on the
stage, and to see it performed with sin ha
brazen disregard for taboos — perhaps
thai is original. Regardless, you'll laugh
more than you ever would during an
episode of Springer, and you still get to
walk away feeling holier than thou.
