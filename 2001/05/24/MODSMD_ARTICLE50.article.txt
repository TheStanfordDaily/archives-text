Question: Dear Koxy Sass,
I was getting the best blow job of my life, and 1 came in her mouth. She swallowed like a champ, but then afterwards she
told me that according to sexual etiquette, 1 should have told her when 1 was about to come so she could decide whether she
wanted to swallow or not. Is this true? Is there really sexual etiquette?
Signed,
Flash Flood
Answer: Yes, nitwit, there really is "sexual etiquette." This was covered mid-December of fifth grade when the boys were taken
to the gym with the I'.K. teacher and the girls stayed in class fora very informative film. Perhaps you had thicken pox that
year? So, yes, it is considered, well, considerate to let the girl or guy know what's coming. So to speak.
That said, however, 1 must warn against the heinous practice of repeated spurious warnings, also known as "deja spew."
How does this work, you ask? Well, if your partner is working on you for any length of time, his or her jaw muscles are no
doubt approaching involuntary spasm, and you don't want that.
When you offer the signal that indicates the climactic end of festivities, your partner is spurred to sprint to the finish line.
But then you yank back the tape for another lap, and she's forced to work on already tapped reserves. Do this too many times
and you're in danger of getting a warning shot fired across your bow. Oh, she'll pretend it's an accident. .. but that fugacious
incisor scrape is not the result of untutored technique. It's a glimpse of her as-yet-unreleased book, titled "Mr. Happy Learns
a Lesson."'
And since I've taken on the role of fellatio police (69th precinct), perhaps it's time to address the issue of taste. You ob
viously have none, but here's something they don't teach you on the Frugal Gourmet. If you consume alkaline foods, coffee,
dairy products or, most importantly, asparagus, you're not going to be winning Iron Chef anytime soon. So ditch the morn
ing latte or your baby batter will taste like coffee that's been internally percolated. Yak.
On the other hand, if you're out with your significant other and he or she orders you a pina colada to wash down your
fruit plate appetizer, don't turn it down in favor of the braised asparagus. Consumption of asparagus on a date is about as at
tractive as Strom Thurmond in bondage gear. ("Bring out the gimp!" "The gimp's sponsoring legislation to declare lefferson
Davis secretary of grits." "Well. I guess you're just gonna have to give him 50cc's of Ensure and wheel his ass over.")-
All right, kiddies, have you been listening? A quick review for those who are skirnmin' through Yuz they got pimpin' to
do â€”
DON'T: "I'm about to coo ... (10 minute lapse) I'm about to cooo . . . (12.3 minute lapse) Uhhhhhh. Uhhhhhgggg.
Sorry. Let me get you an Altoid."
D(): "UhhhhhhhrmabouttocomervehadpineapplecofTeeandasparagustodaymakeyourownchoicerilrespectyourdeci
sionuhhhhhggggg."
This concludes your BJAT review session. You won't find it at Kaplan, hut then again you don't have to pay $1,500 ei
ther. It only comes from the Martha Stewart of dorm rooms and backseats
Yours truly,
Roxy Sass
1. For those of you keeping track at home, the official scoring for this metaphor is as follows: An author fires a cannon across the bow
of a naval slup while running a distance race, which is all pretty impressive considering she's simultaneously slobbing your knob.
2. Zed and Strom go way back. Like antebellum back.
