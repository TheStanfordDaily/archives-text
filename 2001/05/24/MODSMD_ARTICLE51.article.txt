# Upstairs at Berkeley's famous Chez Panisse

( lliez Panisse lias become an institution in tin- Bay Art'a, attracting tourists and (California natives alike. Located in downtown Berkeley, the restaurant
was opened in l<)71 by Alice Waters, an idealistic (lief who believed in cooking with organically grown food.
I reviewed the upstairs cafe, which has a reputation of being just as delicious as the downstairs establishment, but at half the price. The downstairs
restaurant is only open for dinner, and the menu always consists of one fixed-price, five-course meal.
At I'he (lafe, whit h is open for lunch and dinner, I was able to afford three appetizers, one entree and three desserts for under $80. My friends
and I enjoyed impet < able, intelligent service throughout the evening. We were given .1 table in a quaint, sunny room and enjoyed a roadside view of down
town Berkeley.
1 had invited an out-of-town 112 riend who wanted to sample Califbrnian fare, so we started out with warm Sonoma goat cheese, breaded and served with
mixed greens. The cheese was rich in texture, perfectly contrasted with the light breading and crisp, fresh Meslin lettuce.

Since I have always loved carrot finger soup, we ordered Alice Water's version to see if there was a difference between dining hall soup and organic puree. Of course,
there was — ginger has a tendency ol overpowering foods if not done right, but, in this case, the ginger enhanced the flavor of the carrots.
We also tried a pan-fried sand dab, a California fish that was fresh and tasty and nicely paired with sauteed Vidalia onions and capers.
for our entree, we shared the pan-fried chicken breast wrapped in prosciutto, going on the recommendation of the waiter. He told us that the rich prosciutto brought out the mild
flavor of the chicken and we agreed; the prosciutto and chicken combination was an excellent contrast of tastes.
I be chicken was served with delicious garden vegetables. We were especially impressed with the green peas. As my friend said, "They don't have wrinkles , like the frozen kind." We
popped them into our mouths, and the peas tasted like I bad just picked them from the garden.
For dessert, we shared three delicious choices — chocolate pave with pistachio praline cream, rhubarb almond tart and coflee almond ice cream with bittersweet chocolate chips. Each
flavor balanced the other: We had a selection of sweet, tart and creamy.
I was especially impressed with the pave, a light, crisp cake that was incredibly flavorful. After dining at The Cafe of Chez Panisse, I have decided that organically grown fixxl makes
a difference in cooking. My friend left the Bay Area yesterday with a wonderful, gourmet impression of California's cuisine. And I will go back again, possibly to the restaurant down
stairs — if I save up enough money.
