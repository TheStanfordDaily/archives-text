The study is being conducted using an eating
disorder prevention software (ailed Student Bod
ies. Barr Taylor, a professor ol psychiatn and be
havioral sciences, and Andrew Win/elberg, .1 so
cial science resean h associate in ihc I*s\chi;Â»tr\
Department, developed Student Bodies .11 Stan
ford in 1993.
Win/elberg is heading 1 lie bod\ image enhanu
ment study. "There are two goals 101 the studv,"
Win/elberg said. " I he is to reduce weight and
shape concerns, which in tin 11 loweis the nunibei ol
eating disorders amongst women. Ihe second is 10
help women leel generalh bellei about then bodies
and themselves."
The lirst round of the stud\ is being conducted
with 45 lemale students from Stanlord. Ihe ic
searttiers say the women selet ted do not have a good
image ol their bodies and do not presentb have am
eating disordei s.
1 lie lemale partit ipants begin b\ passing an intci
view so that relevant data lor the stud\ ( an be collet 1-
ed. I hey then attend a total ol eight sessions ol be
tween one .ind one-hall and two hours even week.
Ihe sessions lake place online, so suhjet is (.111 part it -
ipate from home.
I he content of the sessions are 011 interactive
Web sites and vary from materi
als on other women's experi
ences and articles on eating dis
orders to nutritional advice. 1 lie
women also partit ipate 111 online
discussion groups and can post
messages for the other partici
pants to read.
" The women are discouraged
to talk about how the\ feel fat and
don't like their bodies, since it has
been proved that these types of

conversations can lead to eating
disorders," VVin/elberg said. " I he
sessions cover the healthy ways to
control bod\ weight and how to in
tegrate healtln eating and exercis
ing into dailv life."
1 he participants go to shop
ping malls, studving the wav
women look and going back to
discuss their feelings. I hev are
asked to write an autobiograph\
online about their bodv image
and to keep note of when changes
start to occur.
"We want the participants to
develop positive attitudes about
their bodies and then >40 a tic I

talk lo their friends and family
about what they've learned,"
Winzelberg said.
According to Winzelberg, the
second round of tlie study will
t.ike place in the fall of 2001,
when they will recruit more fe
tnale participants. The re
searchers say 11 lev hope to have
studied around 300 women and
have the results published 111
clinical and psychiatric consult

tr\ Department have previousk
