On May 25, 1920, I lie I >ail\ printed an editorial
about scholarship standards .it Stanford.
"Probabh only a small minoi it\ leel ili.il the schol
arship standard is exceptional!) high, although this
group seems to increase with the announcement of
those on probation and first failure.
"Many students fail to see the advantages of the
truths set forth, but undoubtedh Stanford has
gained prestige from her scholarship standard. A
graduate of Stanford enjoys a prestige which may oi
may not get him a job but at least it makes a degree
from Stanford more valuable than another might be.
Therefore it is n.itin.il to com lude that although the
list of first failures and probations may grow in
length, the result is Ibi the greatest good to the great
est number."
Bottom line: Based on this, students should be clamoring for
lower grades.
