### VESSELA STOYANOVA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group <>t stude nts ended their unique two
day play run ol "I I.unlet" List night.
"We Players," an independent drama orga
nization on campus, performed the popular
Shakespearean. Sophomore director Ava Rov,
who also starred as one of the four Hamlets,
pushed the boundaries of theatrical convention
with her new adaptation.
With .111 unconventional structure, the pla\
required the audieiue members to stand-up and
move from m cue to scene around the outside of
the (lantor Arts (.enter. Since there were no for
mal seats, viewers either stood or sat on the
ground while the actors performed their lines.
1 his was not a new experience tor Roy, who

also direc ted an outdoor Romeo and |uliet List
vear. Her interest is in environmental theater,
where she said that she "can use public spaces
and lill them with some magic." I lie director
said that she prefers staging her plavs outdoors,
so that thev pick up viewers who are passing l>\
on their way to class.
She noted th.it last vear's Romeo and |uliet
took a similar structure.
"It was cool tor the students on their wa\ to
< lass, passing through the main quad, to be able
to witness the sword fight between t lapulets and
Montagues," she s.iicl.
Rov continued: " 1 wanted it not to be e.isv tor
the audience like in .1 regular theater w here vou
)i Ist go in and buv .1 ticket and take voui sc-.it; in
stead, I wanted them to feel the action .uicl emo
tions, to be immersed in them, f"his is happen

in«; now and vou arc part <>tit," she said.
Another unique aspect of the prodiulion was
that, in some cases, multiple actors played the
same role. For instance, there were four Ham
lets, tour ()phclias and a multi-person C iliost.
"Hamlet is a plav tli.it has so many motiva
tion to every thought and act and I thought we
should have multiple players to express the dif
lercnt aspects of w hat it means to he that charac
teisaid Rov. "Kach role has many dimensions
w hit li come together into a unified whole.
I he fact that two of the I lamlets were played
In female actors and one of the Ophelias was
I>l.i\112( 1 l>\ a male actor added another dimen
sion to the production.
"We were not trying to make a statement, hut
to transcend gender altogether — [the charac
lei s| words can be yours, they can he anyone's,"
said Roy.
1 he pla\ s production took six weeks, in the
(ourse of which main of the ideas came spon
taneously "Kverv time we got together, magic
happened, and the final product became more
tangible," said junior cast-member Megan
Wood.
"Kver\ rehearsal did something new to
at hieve the most beautiful result," said fresh
man Maggie Blake, who played multiple
roles.
" I he plav was a festival, a celebration, a pa
rade and, at the same time, a serious work of
art," said Rov. "It struck a balance between cre
ating art and having fun, and then letting the
audience share in what we've created. Mv goal
was to bring life bat k to things, to invigorate the
audience, since there are so main students w ho
are toot aught up in the at atlemit web."
|unit)i ( hiistina Anagick, who saw the pro
duction, enjoyed the cast's versatility. "It was
captivating because they were able to expose
themselves and share their emotions," she said.
She found it part it ularlv effective w hen, dm ing
the more intense scenes, the multiple plavcrs of
each role spoke simultaneously, augmenting
the dramatit effect, it also moved junior |essic
Areen to tears.
"I was overwhelmingly immersed in the
emotion," Areen said. "I'd never truly felt I lain
let before!"
