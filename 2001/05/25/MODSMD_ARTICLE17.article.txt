Published Since IS 1 )I

AS SI MMKR Al , 1 > R()ACIIKS, many
students, especially women, are feel
ing the need to run, work out and
bull tip before returning home. Is
sues with bodv image are huge on college cam
puses, and Stanford is no exception. As a re

study to help college women feel more confi
dent about their bodies. While this studv will
recogni/e the problems facing many women
on campus, we don't need another statement
ol the obvious. We hope this studv will develop
lines ol communication about body image to .1
larget community of women.

In the School of Medicine study, 45 female
participants will complete weekly sessions on
line, using software developed at Stanford in
I<J93. I lie sessions include discussion groups
,ind message boards. One ol the study's re
searchers s.iid the point of these sessions is to
covet healthy ways to control weight and inte
grate healthy amounts of exercise into every
<la\ life. Sine, there are support groups galore
lot people on campus, but it seems that atten
dance at these meetings is sparse. B\ testing
the 011-line method of interaction, thecomlbrt
of speaking from one's own room 01 residence
could reduce the stigma and fear associated
with talking about the body in a lace-to-face
disc ussion. bod\ image is one ol the last big
taboos at lie >ng college students today, but noth
ing is going to improve il the methods for talk

ing about the issue aren't eflective. C llearly, this
study has the potential to investigate ways to
make dialogue less scary and more valuable for
hundreds of students and, eventually, the sur
rounding community.
I he current set ol support services lot peo
ple with eating disorders and body image is
sues on c ampus provides a much-needed net
work, but these services can also unnecessarily
create issues with other students. Many female
students sav they never thought they had is
sues with their body until coining to college
and learning that so many other women have
image problems. 1 he c urrent research study
should not simply repeat what many re
searchers already know — that high numbers
of college women have problems with their
bodies. Rather, it is our hope and the hope of

I lie investigators that 11 it* participants have
meaningful, positive and open discussions that
they share with the surrounding community.
On a campus where running and sunning
are necessary parts of many students' lives, it's
not surprising that body image and eating dis
orders are huge issues. Ihe University has
provided ample support services to recognize
these problems. Many researchers are study
ing eating disorders and developing ways to
help, and many students are coping with body
image problems. Stanford is a great resource
lor educating other campuses and organiza
tions about body image issues. 1 his study has
the potential to be a starting point for dialogue
not only on this campus, but also in the outside
community.
