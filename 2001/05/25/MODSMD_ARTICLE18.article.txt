# I HAVE ISSUES
## Procrastinator Games 
### 
Ok. iv, it's crunch lime. You've
slat keel oil lor ilie entire quar
ter, yet somehow, by the grace
<>l Clod, you still have the op
portunity to pull it .ill together. All \ou
have to do is write this one last paper. You
are 15 hours and seven profound pages
awav from pulling oil the most remark
able procrastination scam <>l all time. All
vou have to do now is bm kle down, con
centrate fbi a lew hours and in the motn-

ing the pain will be
over — at least until you
receive vour grade.
This scenario, I'm
sure, is familiar to many
of us here. You sit down
at your computer, hours
bclore a major report is
due, knowing that if you
can just manage to sur-

vivo tonight everything will he line.
We sil down with the hest <>l intentions,
don't we? However, somewhere between
startup mode and opening up Microsoft
Word we losec ontrol of the mouse, we lose
control of ourselves, essentially and end
np in the game /one.
Like so many college students, I can't
work on my computer anymore without
being tempted by debilitating distrac tei s. I
have so many games now th.it I'm sui
prised in\ coinpnter still 1 mis. M\ most re
cent obsession lias become Monopoly —
an incrediblv amusing game, despite the
lact that the computer always manages to
build hotels 011 Park l'lace and Boardwalk
just seconds belorc you land 011 it.
Snood is another one of my favorites.
Created in a Tetris-esque fashion, not too
long after yon download this game, you'll
find yourself playing it even though \oit
hate it. And then there's the ever-so-sim
plistic, and generic, Solitaire which is prob
ably more unassumingly evil than the oth
ers (games of liu k are always more detri
mental because with eat li loss you leel less
intelligent, less capable).
In college it seems th.it the computer
plays ,i much more prominent role 111 our
daily lives than at home. M,iyl)e it lias to do
with the absence ol < able television. 1 didn't
realize it until recently. but tin early morn
ing wake-up ritual consists ol turning oil
my alarm and turning on m\ computer (all
done sulxonsc iotisly — the procedure has
become seemingly innate in prat tic e).
1 he recent crackdown on Napster has
further served to make efficiency 011 the
computer more difficult still. One would
think the opposite would happen. One
would think that limiting the existence of
this shareware technology would allow us
to get some work done, that we would stop
focusing 011 downloading the latest miisu al
hit enough to write a p.ipei or read .1 Ixiok.

We've lost .ill sense ol practicality

computers has been reduced to A( )1. In

So what do we do once our c<imputers

Ok. iv, it's crunch lime. You've
slat keel oil lor ilie entire quar
ter, yet somehow, by the grace
<>l Clod, you still have the op
portunity to pull it .ill together. All \ou
have to do is write this one last paper. You
are 15 hours and seven profound pages
awav from pulling oil the most remark
able procrastination scam <>l all time. All
vou have to do now is bm kle down, con
centrate fbi a lew hours and in the motn-

ing the pain will be
over — at least until you
receive vour grade.
This scenario, I'm
sure, is familiar to many
of us here. You sit down
at your computer, hours
bclore a major report is
due, knowing that if you
can just manage to sur-

vivo tonight everything will he line.
We sil down with the hest <>l intentions,
don't we? However, somewhere between
startup mode and opening up Microsoft
Word we losec ontrol of the mouse, we lose
control of ourselves, essentially and end
np in the game /one.
Like so many college students, I can't
work on my computer anymore without
being tempted by debilitating distrac tei s. I
have so many games now th.it I'm sui
prised in\ coinpnter still 1 mis. M\ most re
cent obsession lias become Monopoly —
an incrediblv amusing game, despite the
lact that the computer always manages to
build hotels 011 Park l'lace and Boardwalk
just seconds belorc you land 011 it.
