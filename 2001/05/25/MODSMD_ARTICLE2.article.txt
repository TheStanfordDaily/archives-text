Altei lour years of investigating and experiment
ing. Stanford researt hers have ( ome one step (los
er to understanding neurological degenerative dis
eases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou
Gehrig's disease. A recent stud\ co-authored b\
graduate student Neil hence, biolog\ prolessor
Ron Kopito and setiioi Roopal S.imp.it examines
the role of abnormal proteins in sin h diseases.
While healthy nerve < ells are able to break down
and discard defective proteins, cells suffering from
neurodegenerative diseases cannot; as .1 result, the
defective proteins clump together to form protein
aggregates, which hinder the normal function of
the nerve cells.
"It's been known for years that most neurode
generative diseases are associated with protein ag
gregates. but no one had a clue as to the exat t rela
tionship. Do aggregates cause the disease, or are
the\ the result of the disease?" Kopito said.
Kopito and Bene e lonsti uctcd a lab experiment
to stud\ the connei lion between protein aggregates
and the regular operations of the cell, focusing on a
pat t of the < ell ( ailed the proteasome.
" I he proteasome is like a salami slicer that cuts
protein molecules into little bits." Kopito said. "It
gets rid of abnormal proteins, and 11 breaks down

and recvcles regulators proteins 110 longei needed
by ihe cell."
When genet it cnorsoi mutations cause proteins
lo lorm into (lie wrong shape, these proteins (.111
build up inside nerves and c ause diseases, lo pre
\ent this, a molecule < ailed übi(|uitin at t etc lies it sell
to the mutated protein and leads it to the protea
some, which then breaks up the abnormal protein.
When this system l.nls. unwanted proteins
tagged with übi(|uitin are not destroved b\ the pro
teasonie. Kopito and Hence s experiment targeted
the role ol nullum tioning proteasonies 111 siu h os
tein failures.
I o test proteasonie liiik tinning, the reseai (liei s
used a molecule called green fluorescent protein
((il l'), which glows green in the presence ol special
light. Sanip.it treated a version of unstable (>IT
whi< li glowed green unless broken down In pi otea
soines, while Hence conducted experiments using
the engineered (I I*.
" I he level of green lluorescence indicated how
ellit iently the proteasonie was breaking down pro
teins.'' Hence said. "II the cell glowed bright green,
then we knew the proteasonie was not liuu tioning.
When the experimenters inserted mutated pro
teins into ( ells with the (>ll' indicatoi. the < ells .ill
glowed green and protein aggregates formed.

Professor Ron Kopito and graduate student Neil Bence are one step closer to unravelling the mysterious relationship
between proteins and neurological diseases.
I he key finding in our stud\ is
that the function of a protcasome
can be impaired In the presenceol
protein aggregates," Kopito said.
I hese results provide the first
well-documented linkage between
protein aggregation and a < ritii al
cellular function."
The explanation for protca
some failure is still not fulh (lear,
although Hence said the study
proves "that aggregates them
selves can affect the protcasome
and cause toxicity."
11 aggregate proteins are to

blame, then a possible treatment
tor neurodegenerative diseases
could involve dissolving the ag
gregates or preventing them
from ihrming, Kopito said.
However, the researchers de
scribed the results .is basic scien
tific work rather than indicative
ot immediate medical solutions
for diseases.
"[These experiments] provide
an insight into a possible mecha
nism that could potentially ex
plain a kev aspect ot how neurons
might die in many aging related
neurodegenerative diseases. Ko
pito said. "I lowever, the patholog
ic.il mechanisms of these diseases
are extremely complex and are
surely the consequence of a vast

network ot interacting tac tors. It is
likeh that our results have identi
fied one of these factors."
I he stuch. which was published
in toda\\s issue ol the join nal Sci
ence. was the culmination ot much
dedication and perseverance
through temporal \ obstacles.
" I he most frustrating part was
dealing with (lie initi.il reaction to
our woi k from the tirst journal to
which we submitted it. They
didn't even want to review it be
cause thev thought that it wasn't
novel enough!" Kopito said.
Sainp.it found the research
process to be c hallenging but ful
filling.
"You think you might have
mastered a teehniquc or extract-

Ed some meaningful data from an
experiment, but then you spend
weeks or even months trying to
replicate what you've done," she
said. "Consequently, you start
wondering whether the effect
von saw was real in the first place.
But then the most rewarding part
is when things finally start work
ing again, and you realize that all
those weeks of frustration were
just part of a learning proc ess to
get you to this end point."
Bence agreed that conduct
ing the study was well worth the
frustrations.
"We had invested a good por
tion of a year developing an
assav just to test our hypothesis.
There was no guarantee that we

would get the result that we did,
so it was an exciting reward for
the time investment." he said.
"In addition, this lias been a
great personal challenge. I have
a [bachelor of science degree] in
plant biology from |the Univer
sity of( '.alifornia at Davis], so en
tering the field ol mammalian
c ell biology and neuroclegenera
tion lias been challenging."
Kopito said tli.it while "nun li
more basic research needs to be
done before we can understand
the extent to which our findings
illuminate the disease mecha
nism," he is confident that "in the
long run these insights will help to
design ellective therapeutics to
treat neurodegenerative diseases.
