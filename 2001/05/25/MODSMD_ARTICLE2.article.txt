Altei lour years of investigating and experiment
ing. Stanford researt hers have ( ome one step (los
er to understanding neurological degenerative dis
eases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou
Gehrig's disease. A recent stud\ co-authored b\
graduate student Neil hence, biolog\ prolessor
Ron Kopito and setiioi Roopal S.imp.it examines
the role of abnormal proteins in sin h diseases.
While healthy nerve < ells are able to break down
and discard defective proteins, cells suffering from
neurodegenerative diseases cannot; as .1 result, the
defective proteins clump together to form protein
aggregates, which hinder the normal function of
the nerve cells.
"It's been known for years that most neurode
generative diseases are associated with protein ag
gregates. but no one had a clue as to the exat t rela
tionship. Do aggregates cause the disease, or are
the\ the result of the disease?" Kopito said.
Kopito and Bene e lonsti uctcd a lab experiment
to stud\ the connei lion between protein aggregates
and the regular operations of the cell, focusing on a
pat t of the < ell ( ailed the proteasome.
" I he proteasome is like a salami slicer that cuts
protein molecules into little bits." Kopito said. "It
gets rid of abnormal proteins, and 11 breaks down

and recvcles regulators proteins 110 longei needed
by ihe cell."
When genet it cnorsoi mutations cause proteins
lo lorm into (lie wrong shape, these proteins (.111
build up inside nerves and c ause diseases, lo pre
\ent this, a molecule < ailed übi(|uitin at t etc lies it sell
to the mutated protein and leads it to the protea
some, which then breaks up the abnormal protein.
When this system l.nls. unwanted proteins
tagged with übi(|uitin are not destroved b\ the pro
teasonie. Kopito and Hence s experiment targeted
the role ol nullum tioning proteasonies 111 siu h os
tein failures.
I o test proteasonie liiik tinning, the reseai (liei s
used a molecule called green fluorescent protein
((il l'), which glows green in the presence ol special
light. Sanip.it treated a version of unstable (>IT
whi< li glowed green unless broken down In pi otea
soines, while Hence conducted experiments using
the engineered (I I*.
" I he level of green lluorescence indicated how
ellit iently the proteasonie was breaking down pro
teins.'' Hence said. "II the cell glowed bright green,
then we knew the proteasonie was not liuu tioning.
When the experimenters inserted mutated pro
teins into ( ells with the (>ll' indicatoi. the < ells .ill
glowed green and protein aggregates formed.

Professor Ron Kopito and graduate student Neil Bence are one step closer to unravelling the mysterious relationship
between proteins and neurological diseases.
