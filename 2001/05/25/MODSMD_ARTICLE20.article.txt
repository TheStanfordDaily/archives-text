Campaign to promote giving about
'much more than money'
()n behalf of I lie I nivcrsitv s (Mice of
Development, and the Stanford Alumni
Association, we would like to respond to
1 lie Daily's Ma\ 17 editot ial ("Movie pro
moling alumni giving misses the mark").
l'he film in question is hut one ele
ment ol the Campaign tor I ndergradu
ate Kducation announced last fall h\ I ni
versity President |ohn llennessy.
1 hrough this campaign, Stanford hopes
to raise $1 billion to make recent educa
tional innovations, such as Stanford In
troducton Studies. <t permanent part ol
the undergraduate experience. At the
same time, the campaign seeks to signifi
cantly increase support lor undergradu
ate scholarships so that need-blind ad
mission will remain as much a part ol
Stanford's character as academic rigor.
In addition to the campaign s mone
tary goals, we are pursuing several non
monetary goals. First, we intend to make
a hold statement about the importance ol
undergraduate education to our stu
dents. faculty, stall and alumni and to the
world at large. Second, we intend to use
the excitement created by the campaign
and related events to re-energi/e our re
gional alumni outreach programs to con
nect with Stanford alumni who don't
often get back to campus. Third, we hope
that the excitement generated by the

campaign and its programs engages a
new generation of volunteers. I'he cam
paign ellort, therefore, is about much
more than money.
Beginning ilus fall, Stanford is taking
the undergraduate experience "on the
road." 1 lie Ollice of Development, in
partnership with the Stanford Alumni
Association, is producing a 12-city, 9-
month tour c ailed " 1 liink Again.'' Start
ing in Seattle on Sept. 29. the tour will at
tempt to reconnect alumni, while at the
same time educate them about the re
naissance in undergraduate education
underway on campus.
I he "Think Again" tour will be a
multi-faceted educational experience.
Lasting an entire afternoon and evening,
over 7f> percent of the program will re
volve around the undergraduate aca
demic experience. Faculty panels and
classes will give alumni an opportunity to
be students again. Alumni will even be
given the chance to "experience" intro
ductory seminars in groups of 40.
I he film in question is one important
part of the "Think Again" tour. As we
travel from c ity to c ity, we will use a vari
ety of met hods to reconnect with alumni.
I he tour otters something for everyone
(we hope): ('.lasses, dinner, a presidential
address and the film â€” which is a multi
media virtual tout of Stanford today. ()ur
goal is to attract thousands of alumni to
these events. I he film will be the finale of

the day's events, and a big draw. Conse
quently, it needs to be superior. It needs
to reinforce the message about tinder
graduate education at Stanford and it
needs to resonate in the viewers' heads
and hearts for days to come.
Your questions regarding the film's
cost effectiveness are good ones. We
.iskc-d the same questions when we con
ceptualized the film. We continue to ask
similar hard questions as we proceed, not
only about the film, but also about the
tour and how we reach our alumni. In
our roles, we are committed to achieving
a high return on investment for all activ
ities in which we participate. It is in this
context ih.it we assure you that both the
tour and the film are efficient invest
ments in Stanford's future, both in terms
of alumni relations and fundraising.
As you may know, income from Stan
lord's endowment provides just 18 per
cent of the University's annual budget of
$1.7 billion. The remainder must be
raised anew each year. Consequently,
any inefficiency in that effort would de
feat the purpose. Overall, however. Stan
ford spends less than 10 cents on alumni
relations and development per dollar
raised. I bis figure compares extremely
favorably with "marketing" costs at other
non-profit organizations and is signifi
cantly lower than at private companies.
