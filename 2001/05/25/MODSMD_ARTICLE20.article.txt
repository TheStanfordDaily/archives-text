Campaign to promote giving about
'much more than money'
()n behalf of I lie I nivcrsitv s (Mice of
Development, and the Stanford Alumni
Association, we would like to respond to
1 lie Daily's Ma\ 17 editot ial ("Movie pro
moling alumni giving misses the mark").
l'he film in question is hut one ele
ment ol the Campaign tor I ndergradu
ate Kducation announced last fall h\ I ni
versity President |ohn llennessy.
1 hrough this campaign, Stanford hopes
to raise $1 billion to make recent educa
tional innovations, such as Stanford In
troducton Studies. <t permanent part ol
the undergraduate experience. At the
same time, the campaign seeks to signifi
cantly increase support lor undergradu
ate scholarships so that need-blind ad
mission will remain as much a part ol
Stanford's character as academic rigor.
In addition to the campaign s mone
tary goals, we are pursuing several non
monetary goals. First, we intend to make
a hold statement about the importance ol
undergraduate education to our stu
dents. faculty, stall and alumni and to the
world at large. Second, we intend to use
the excitement created by the campaign
and related events to re-energi/e our re
gional alumni outreach programs to con
nect with Stanford alumni who don't
often get back to campus. Third, we hope
that the excitement generated by the

campaign and its programs engages a
new generation of volunteers. I'he cam
paign ellort, therefore, is about much
more than money.
Beginning ilus fall, Stanford is taking
the undergraduate experience "on the
road." 1 lie Ollice of Development, in
partnership with the Stanford Alumni
Association, is producing a 12-city, 9-
month tour c ailed " 1 liink Again.'' Start
ing in Seattle on Sept. 29. the tour will at
tempt to reconnect alumni, while at the
same time educate them about the re
naissance in undergraduate education
underway on campus.
I he "Think Again" tour will be a
multi-faceted educational experience.
Lasting an entire afternoon and evening,
over 7f> percent of the program will re
volve around the undergraduate aca
demic experience. Faculty panels and
classes will give alumni an opportunity to
be students again. Alumni will even be
given the chance to "experience" intro
ductory seminars in groups of 40.
I he film in question is one important
part of the "Think Again" tour. As we
travel from c ity to c ity, we will use a vari
ety of met hods to reconnect with alumni.
I he tour otters something for everyone
(we hope): ('.lasses, dinner, a presidential
address and the film — which is a multi
media virtual tout of Stanford today. ()ur
goal is to attract thousands of alumni to
these events. I he film will be the finale of

the day's events, and a big draw. Conse
quently, it needs to be superior. It needs
to reinforce the message about tinder
graduate education at Stanford and it
needs to resonate in the viewers' heads
and hearts for days to come.
Your questions regarding the film's
cost effectiveness are good ones. We
.iskc-d the same questions when we con
ceptualized the film. We continue to ask
similar hard questions as we proceed, not
only about the film, but also about the
tour and how we reach our alumni. In
our roles, we are committed to achieving
a high return on investment for all activ
ities in which we participate. It is in this
context ih.it we assure you that both the
tour and the film are efficient invest
ments in Stanford's future, both in terms
of alumni relations and fundraising.
As you may know, income from Stan
lord's endowment provides just 18 per
cent of the University's annual budget of
$1.7 billion. The remainder must be
raised anew each year. Consequently,
any inefficiency in that effort would de
feat the purpose. Overall, however. Stan
ford spends less than 10 cents on alumni
relations and development per dollar
raised. I bis figure compares extremely
favorably with "marketing" costs at other
non-profit organizations and is signifi
cantly lower than at private companies.
We also applaud your questions about
how representative the film is of under
graduate life todav. 1 he focus <>1 the film
in partially on Stanford, hut mainly on the
programs to he funded hv the campaign.
1 <> this end. the film attempts to describe
the nature of student-faculty relation
ships in programs like Freshman and
Sophomore Seminars; the experiences
available through I ntleigraduate Re
search ()pportunities; the chance lor ex
ploration through the Overseas Studies
Program; the value of public servile
through the Haas ( .enter; and the ener
getic, intelligent students who motivate
eat li other at Stanford.
I he film was not intended to be a"day
in the life" of the I niversity, but instead a
t elehration of the rebirth ol undergradu
ate education. And .is with all celebra
tions, we have taken some artistic license
(i.e.. singing in front of Memorial ('.lunch
at midnight). But please be assured that
this is about much mote than aesthetics.
And to the extent we have been intrusive,
we apologi/e. We have worked hard to
minimize disruptions. ()ur sincere apolo
gies go out to auvonc who lias been in
convenienced .ind our gratitude goes to
the hundreds of people (faculty, si.ill and
students) who have volunteered then
help .ind are featured in the production.
Finally, we welcome your questions
and ideas about how best to connect with
alumni. We are constanth studying this
topic, testing new ideas and soliciting
feedback. However, one thing rings true
m all out interactions with alumni: I hey
aren't just interested in talking about
what n was like "wav back when." but in
stead are \ it a 11\ interested in what Stan
ford is like today. We are excited about
the " I liink Again" tour and the chance to
tell alumni what is happening on campus
today. Like them, we leel deeply reward
ed by witnessing the ac complislunents ol
Stanford students and l>\ supporting
their endeavors.

Students are bound to become more car

Freshman car policy causes fiasco,
University fails to respond
While I liiul ii commendable thai the
I iii\ersit\ look steps to alleviate the over
( rowdetl pat king problems on campus, it
has been apparent evei since its inception
ill.it the ban on lreshman (ars is absolute
ly not the solution.
All of the problems that have been
pointed onl b\ letters lo I he Dail\ in re
cent weeks have acknowledged that the
problems with implementing the ban on
freshman cats were entirely predictable.
I'ioin the ven beginning, most people
agreed that banning freshman cars
would make oil-campus trips more difli
cnit, if not impossible. Most students also
predicted the failure ol the I nivetsity's
priman proposed solution to tins (and
ever) other campus) problem: expansion
of the Marguerite. 1 he ( Mlice of Student
Allans' plan to provide an inexpensive
rental <ai service was laughable from the
beginning .is well. I he strain that a ban
on freshman cars would place on resident
stall in freshman dorms was also c.is\ to
forecast, but went largeh ignored and
unaddresscd b\ the I niversitv

Perhaps less prcdic table was the b.tc k
lash caused In the decreased supplv of
accessible cars on < ampus, whic li has 111-
crcased demand to the point that an ex
tremely lugli percentageol cm rent li esli
men plan to bring cars back to campus
next tail. Having a car 011 campus is 110
longer viewed as a luxury, but rathei an
upperc lass necessity.
t'.learlv, the parking situation lias not
been greatly improved by the ban on
freshman cars. When the plan was first
introduced in the Spring of 1090, the Of
fice of Student Affairs was quoted in 1 lie
Daily as saving that well over 50 percent
(.iiul as high .is 7"> percent) of freshmen
bring cars to campus b\ the end of their
first \ear. li seemed logical that decreas
ing the number of freshman < ars on c am
pus would increase the amount of park
ing. However, most students (especially
those w 110 were freshmen at the time) un
derstood that this statistic was uttcrl\
ridiculous. 1 lie number ol freshman (ars
was never as high as reported, and thus
eliminating freshman cars was a token so
lution to a real problem.
If the University really wants to im
prove parkingon campus, thex must pre
sent real incentives (i.e., not the Mar
guerite) to keep students and employees
from parking on campus. Simply trying
to decrease supply is futile, as evidenced
by the freshman car fiasco.

Senior gift is long-term investment
Several ret cut editorials and letters to

Stanford Fund distributes the money
raised lo fund need-based undergradu

that improve undergraduate life, such as
the I RO program, freshman / sopho
more seminars, sophomore college, the
campus communitv centers and student
groups, through the Student (Iroup
Partnership (vou know, writing thank
ytm notes to alumni in return for help
funding vour group's activities).

I he Stanford Fund serves as a com
mon fund-raiser for tlie undergraduate
community. It docs fundraising so that
student groups, ihi- community tenters
and other important programs — who
do not have the time, the stall, or lite in-
Irastim ture to fundraise — can continue
to liitu tton with strong funding.

It is a long-term investment to keep the

Freshman car policy causes fiasco,

I'ioin the ven beginning, most people
agreed that banning freshman cars
would make oil-campus trips more difli

predicted the failure ol the I nivetsity's

of the Marguerite. 1 he ( Mlice of Student

on freshman cars would place on resident

next tail. Having a car 011 campus is 110
longer viewed as a luxury, but rathei an
upperc lass necessity.
t'.learlv, the parking situation lias not
been greatly improved by the ban on
freshman cars. When the plan was first
introduced in the Spring of 1090, the Of
fice of Student Affairs was quoted in 1 lie

(.iiul as high .is 7"> percent) of freshmen
bring cars to campus b\ the end of their

those w 110 were freshmen at the time) un
derstood that this statistic was uttcrl\
ridiculous. 1 lie number ol freshman (ars
was never as high as reported, and thus
eliminating freshman cars was a token so
lution to a real problem.
If the University really wants to im
prove parkingon campus, thex must pre
sent real incentives (i.e., not the Mar

from parking on campus. Simply trying
to decrease supply is futile, as evidenced
by the freshman car fiasco.

Campaign to promote giving about
'much more than money'
()n behalf of I lie I nivcrsitv s (Mice of
Development, and the Stanford Alumni
Association, we would like to respond to
1 lie Daily's Ma\ 17 editot ial ("Movie pro
moling alumni giving misses the mark").
l'he film in question is hut one ele
ment ol the Campaign tor I ndergradu

1 hrough this campaign, Stanford hopes
to raise $1 billion to make recent educa
tional innovations, such as Stanford In
troducton Studies. <t permanent part ol
the undergraduate experience. At the
same time, the campaign seeks to signifi
cantly increase support lor undergradu
ate scholarships so that need-blind ad
mission will remain as much a part ol
Stanford's character as academic rigor.
In addition to the campaign s mone
tary goals, we are pursuing several non
monetary goals. First, we intend to make
a hold statement about the importance ol
undergraduate education to our stu
dents. faculty, stall and alumni and to the
world at large. Second, we intend to use
the excitement created by the campaign
and related events to re-energi/e our re
gional alumni outreach programs to con
nect with Stanford alumni who don't
often get back to campus. Third, we hope
that the excitement generated by the

campaign and its programs engages a
new generation of volunteers. I'he cam
paign ellort, therefore, is about much
more than money.
Beginning ilus fall, Stanford is taking
the undergraduate experience "on the
road." 1 lie Ollice of Development, in
partnership with the Stanford Alumni
Association, is producing a 12-city, 9-
month tour c ailed " 1 liink Again.'' Start
ing in Seattle on Sept. 29. the tour will at
tempt to reconnect alumni, while at the
same time educate them about the re
naissance in undergraduate education
underway on campus.
I he "Think Again" tour will be a
multi-faceted educational experience.
Lasting an entire afternoon and evening,
over 7f> percent of the program will re
volve around the undergraduate aca
demic experience. Faculty panels and
classes will give alumni an opportunity to
be students again. Alumni will even be
given the chance to "experience" intro
ductory seminars in groups of 40.
I he film in question is one important
part of the "Think Again" tour. As we
travel from c ity to c ity, we will use a vari
ety of met hods to reconnect with alumni.
I he tour otters something for everyone
(we hope): ('.lasses, dinner, a presidential
address and the film — which is a multi
media virtual tout of Stanford today. ()ur
goal is to attract thousands of alumni to
these events. I he film will be the finale of

the day's events, and a big draw. Conse
quently, it needs to be superior. It needs
to reinforce the message about tinder
graduate education at Stanford and it
needs to resonate in the viewers' heads
and hearts for days to come.
Your questions regarding the film's
cost effectiveness are good ones. We
.iskc-d the same questions when we con
ceptualized the film. We continue to ask
similar hard questions as we proceed, not
only about the film, but also about the
tour and how we reach our alumni. In
our roles, we are committed to achieving
a high return on investment for all activ
ities in which we participate. It is in this
context ih.it we assure you that both the

Campaign to promote giving about
'much more than money'
()n behalf of I lie I nivcrsitv s (Mice of
Development, and the Stanford Alumni
Association, we would like to respond to
1 lie Daily's Ma\ 17 editot ial ("Movie pro
moling alumni giving misses the mark").
l'he film in question is hut one ele
ment ol the Campaign tor I ndergradu
ate Kducation announced last fall h\ I ni
versity President |ohn llennessy.
1 hrough this campaign, Stanford hopes
to raise $1 billion to make recent educa
tional innovations, such as Stanford In
troducton Studies. <t permanent part ol
the undergraduate experience. At the
same time, the campaign seeks to signifi
cantly increase support lor undergradu
ate scholarships so that need-blind ad
mission will remain as much a part ol
Stanford's character as academic rigor.
In addition to the campaign s mone
tary goals, we are pursuing several non
monetary goals. First, we intend to make
a hold statement about the importance ol
undergraduate education to our stu
dents. faculty, stall and alumni and to the
world at large. Second, we intend to use
the excitement created by the campaign
and related events to re-energi/e our re
gional alumni outreach programs to con
nect with Stanford alumni who don't
often get back to campus. Third, we hope
that the excitement generated by the

campaign and its programs engages a
new generation of volunteers. I'he cam
paign ellort, therefore, is about much
more than money.
Beginning ilus fall, Stanford is taking
the undergraduate experience "on the
road." 1 lie Ollice of Development, in
partnership with the Stanford Alumni
Association, is producing a 12-city, 9-
month tour c ailed " 1 liink Again.'' Start
ing in Seattle on Sept. 29. the tour will at
tempt to reconnect alumni, while at the
same time educate them about the re
naissance in undergraduate education
underway on campus.
I he "Think Again" tour will be a
multi-faceted educational experience.
Lasting an entire afternoon and evening,
over 7f> percent of the program will re
volve around the undergraduate aca
demic experience. Faculty panels and
classes will give alumni an opportunity to
be students again. Alumni will even be
given the chance to "experience" intro
ductory seminars in groups of 40.
I he film in question is one important
part of the "Think Again" tour. As we
travel from c ity to c ity, we will use a vari
ety of met hods to reconnect with alumni.
I he tour otters something for everyone
(we hope): ('.lasses, dinner, a presidential
address and the film — which is a multi
media virtual tout of Stanford today. ()ur
goal is to attract thousands of alumni to
these events. I he film will be the finale of

the day's events, and a big draw. Conse
quently, it needs to be superior. It needs
to reinforce the message about tinder
graduate education at Stanford and it
needs to resonate in the viewers' heads
and hearts for days to come.
Your questions regarding the film's
cost effectiveness are good ones. We
.iskc-d the same questions when we con
ceptualized the film. We continue to ask
similar hard questions as we proceed, not
only about the film, but also about the
tour and how we reach our alumni. In
our roles, we are committed to achieving
a high return on investment for all activ
ities in which we participate. It is in this
context ih.it we assure you that both the
tour and the film are efficient invest
ments in Stanford's future, both in terms
of alumni relations and fundraising.
As you may know, income from Stan
lord's endowment provides just 18 per
cent of the University's annual budget of
$1.7 billion. The remainder must be
raised anew each year. Consequently,
any inefficiency in that effort would de
feat the purpose. Overall, however. Stan
ford spends less than 10 cents on alumni
relations and development per dollar
raised. I bis figure compares extremely
favorably with "marketing" costs at other
non-profit organizations and is signifi
cantly lower than at private companies.
We also applaud your questions about
how representative the film is of under
graduate life todav. 1 he focus <>1 the film
in partially on Stanford, hut mainly on the
programs to he funded hv the campaign.
1 <> this end. the film attempts to describe
the nature of student-faculty relation
ships in programs like Freshman and
Sophomore Seminars; the experiences
available through I ntleigraduate Re
search ()pportunities; the chance lor ex
ploration through the Overseas Studies
Program; the value of public servile
through the Haas ( .enter; and the ener
getic, intelligent students who motivate
eat li other at Stanford.
I he film was not intended to be a"day
in the life" of the I niversity, but instead a
t elehration of the rebirth ol undergradu
ate education. And .is with all celebra
tions, we have taken some artistic license
(i.e.. singing in front of Memorial ('.lunch
at midnight). But please be assured that
this is about much mote than aesthetics.
And to the extent we have been intrusive,
we apologi/e. We have worked hard to
minimize disruptions. ()ur sincere apolo
gies go out to auvonc who lias been in
convenienced .ind our gratitude goes to
the hundreds of people (faculty, si.ill and
students) who have volunteered then
help .ind are featured in the production.
Finally, we welcome your questions
and ideas about how best to connect with
alumni. We are constanth studying this
topic, testing new ideas and soliciting
feedback. However, one thing rings true
m all out interactions with alumni: I hey
aren't just interested in talking about
what n was like "wav back when." but in
stead are \ it a 11\ interested in what Stan
ford is like today. We are excited about
the " I liink Again" tour and the chance to
tell alumni what is happening on campus
today. Like them, we leel deeply reward
ed by witnessing the ac complislunents ol
Stanford students and l>\ supporting
their endeavors.
