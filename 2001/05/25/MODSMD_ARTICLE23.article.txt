Ask ihe stall of Stanford Medical ('.en
ter il they iliink the I Y show KR is accu
rate, and they will all agree on one thing
life in the Kniergenc\ Room is last-pat eel.
KspecialK at Staniord.
Ihe Medical Center's KR treats be
tween 100 and 130 patients every day —
almost 38,500 patients a year — and ac
cording to the Palo Alto Weekly, that fig
ure is expected to rise.
"hmergency Medicine is I»\ its nature
rushed, s.iid Dr. Boh \orris, the Diree

tor of Emergency Services at Stanford.
"W hat we're seeing is an increased uti
lization of the KR for those who don't
have insurance coverage. In that sense
the KR is a saletv net, especiallv lor those
with limited options for medical care,"
he continued.
Ihe Kmergency Room treats a
wide range of conditions, ranging
from traumatic injuries resulting
from auto accidents, violent crimes,
<>r falls, as well .is minor injuries and
medical afflict ions.
While most of the cases that the Stan
lord 1 R receives are medical, the unit

received a significant number ol major
trauma victims — about tour percent —
especially because Stanford has the onlv
Level One Trauma Center in San Mateo
county, and serves as a trauma center
for northern and central California, as
well as for adjacent states. The KR al
most never reroutes trauma victims to
other locations, regardless of how busy
the facility is.
But during its busiest hours, when
patie nts have to lie on gurnevs waiting
lor an open bed, Staniord does "go
reel.' rediree ting the majority ol calls to
other hospitals.

The KR is also facilitates a residency
training program Kniergenc\ Medicine
and collaborates with the Koothill College
paramedic training program.
Another component ol the KR is the
Lite Flight Medical I ransport Program,
which provides emergence critical care
transports by ground vehicles and lixed
wing and rotor-wing aircraft 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Kile Flight uti
lizes both nurse-led and phvsician-led
transport teams depending on the ac uitv
ot the patient.
"Technology has grown, and with
it our ability to evaluate patients,"

Norris said.
According to the Palo Alto Weekly, a
total of 20 st.ilf tvpic alh serve on one shift
for the 23-bed unit. Additionally, Stanford
now has a three-vear KR resident v.
"The emergence department would
empty out at about 2:30 a.m. Now, it sta\
lull .ill night. A really ditlic ult da\ is when
we're lull," said Linda Brac ken, an emer
gency room nurse manager in the Palo
Alto Weekly.
"It takes nurses who like ac tion and get
that adrenaline rush to woi kin the emei -
gencv room," Bracken added. "That's
what makes emergency nurses."
