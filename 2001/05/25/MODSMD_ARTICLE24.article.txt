## Card set to hunt down Red Foxes 
### BRETT KAUFMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Sam Fuld never played baseball in
January before coming to Stanford. He never
competed in an NCAA game, never embarked
on road trips every weekend, never talked i<> a
group of reporters.
He also never saw anything like the NCAA
baseball tournament, which begins today at
Sunken Diamond as the Cardinal hosts Long
Heat h State, Texas and Marist in a four-team,
double elimination regional.
"I think n can't help but feel a little different,"
Fuld said. "People are talking about ii a little
more."

half-fuII Sunken Diamond, more than 4,000 fans

ferent."
Not once before in his previous 24 years as head
coach did Mark Marquess enter the NCAA tour

cant playing time otl the bench. Because it is such
,i new situation, even Marquess doesn't know how
they'll react to the intensified playoff environment.
"You might think this team would be awed by
the postseason, but I don't think tlic-v will be." he
said. "I'm hoping we're not an inexperienc ed team
like we were .it the beginning of the year."
Juniors Chris O'Riordan, Andy I opium and
Auk Van /.melt are the only members of the 2001
Stanford team that have significant postseason at
bals, a major departure from last season's veteran
laden lineup.
