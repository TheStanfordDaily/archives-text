## Card set to hunt down Red Foxes 
### BRETT KAUFMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Sam Fuld never played baseball in
January before coming to Stanford. He never
competed in an NCAA game, never embarked
on road trips every weekend, never talked i<> a
group of reporters.
He also never saw anything like the NCAA
baseball tournament, which begins today at
Sunken Diamond as the Cardinal hosts Long
Heat h State, Texas and Marist in a four-team,
double elimination regional.
"I think n can't help but feel a little different,"
Fuld said. "People are talking about ii a little
more."
1 .ilk about <111 understatement. Instead of a
half-fuII Sunken Diamond, more than 4,000 fans
will pack the seats. I lie grounds crew will hang
bunting along the rails. And Stanford will put its
entire season on the line— yeah, just "a little dif
ferent."
Not once before in his previous 24 years as head
coach did Mark Marquess enter the NCAA tour
nament with two freshman regulars in his outfield,
as he does now with Fuld in c enter and Pacific" 10
(Conference Freshman of the Year (Carlos Quentin
in right. He also gives two more freshmen signifi
cant playing time otl the bench. Because it is such
,i new situation, even Marquess doesn't know how
they'll react to the intensified playoff environment.
"You might think this team would be awed by
the postseason, but I don't think tlic-v will be." he
said. "I'm hoping we're not an inexperienc ed team
like we were .it the beginning of the year."
Juniors Chris O'Riordan, Andy I opium and
Auk Van /.melt are the only members of the 2001
Stanford team that have significant postseason at
bals, a major departure from last season's veteran
laden lineup.
