### DANIELLE MURRAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
-1 lie women's crew team fin
ished its season on a high note
lasi week, as the final poll In I S
Rowing and I lie Collegiate Row
ing (loaches ranked the Cardi
nal among the top twenty crews
in the country for the first time
in the history of the poll.
1 he team moved up to num
ber nineteen in the rankings
after upsetting No. 1 seed W ash
ington Slate and N'o. 5 seed ()re
gon State to take fourth .it tlie
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships. Hut despite its impres
sive finish, the crew did not re
ceive .i bid to tins weekend's na
tion.il championships in
(Gainesville, (ia.
"()ur goal all year was to be in
the top twenty, so il was nice to
have our regular season ending
poll be No. 19," said head coach
Aimee Baker.
" I think that our goal for next
year is to improve on that — to
make our way into the top fif
teen and to earn a team bid to

NCAAs," Baker said. "That's
definitely going to lx- the big
push. The varsiu eight was ver\
tlose this year, but we feel that
next year we'll really have twen
ty athletes pushing to get our
team in."
Among those twenty athletes
will be seven talented new re
cruits. Melissa Fiesler of Jack
sonville, Ma. and Samantha
Magee of Simsbun, (lonn. Both
competed with the I S. national
team at the junior World Row
ing (Championships this year.
Susan BeVille of Chat
tanooga, 1 enn. rowed in the
CanAniMex Gaines, where she
medalled in the single, pair, four
and eight rac es.
"We're onlv graduating three
people, and next year we have
seven recruits coming, which is
one of the biggest recruiting
classes we've had in a really long
time," said senior co-captain
Laurie Mason. "This is just the
first step and 1 think next yeai
the program is only going to get
better."
In order to fulfill that
prophecy, though, next year's
team will have to improve on an
already impressive record.
