# Women struggle at NCAA tourney
## After a disappointing start, team hopes strong finish will put them back in contention

HOWEY-IN-THE-HILLS, FLA. — Not even the
surprise presence of seniors Jessica Belskis and Salimah
Mussani was enough to spur the No. 3 Cardinal back
into contention at the NCAA Women's C.olf Champi
onships yesterday.
Stanford, which finished the day with a disappointing
team score of 12-over-par 300, remained bat kin the pack
in 10th plat e, 19 strokes back ol the leader, top-ranked
Duke, which shot a tournament-best 2-over 200.

1 he day was l)ii of a letdown, considering the high
emotions thai had reverberated in the hotel the night be
fore, when Belskis and Mussani stunned their five other
teammates by walking unexpectedly into a team meeting.
Head coach Caroline O'Connor and assistant coach
I). |. Powers were the only two people who had anticipat
ed the arrival of the two golfers. A couple of members of
the team admitted that they thought something was
strange when Powers began to video tape the team meet
ing — something he had never done before — a couple of
minutes prior to Belskis and Mussani 's entrance.
But when the two walked in, the players' expressions
turned from confusion to delight.
"I was shocked," freshman Kim Kouwabuupat said. "It
was so awesome because we all had wanted them to come
so badly."
Kven though the extra 3,000-mile cross-country trip
added two fresh fates to the gallery, the Cardinal was still
unable to put any low scores on the scoreboard.
Kouwabuupat and sophomore Kim Kowton led the way,
posting 2-over 71s. while senior Stephanie Keever shot a
75 and senior 1 lilary 1 lomeyer shot a 5-over 77.
The only player that seemed to benefit from the added
support was Kouwabuupat, who bettered her second
round score by 10 strokes. Kouwabuupat, nicknamed
"Buns," looked much more confident a day after snug
gling to a dismal 84.
"I can't even say how much better today was,"
Kouwabuupat said. " I played pretty solid and 1 hit the ball
the way I wanted to."
Kouwabuupat certainly knocked her approach shot on
the par-4 Kith hole the way she wanted to. The ball ended
up six inches away from the hole, and Kouwabuupat
tapped it m fora birdie that brought her back to even par.
"She's been playing well lately, but it was just a matter
of her coming out and trusting her ability," said ()'('.on nor
of Kouwabuupat, whose first two rounds were hindered
by quadruple bogeys.
Rowton has been the most consistent of the Cardinal
golfers this week, and currently is tied for 18th place going
into tomorrow's final round. She's going to need some
major help from her teammates if Stanford wants to have
any chance at the title.
"We all need to play well under p.ir tomorrow, and
that's possible — it's not like it would be a fluke," O'Con
nor said, supporting her statement by bringing up the low
numbers th.it Keever (65) and Kouwabuupat (til)) have
put up earlier in the year.
I lungs would be a little easier, though, had the players
put up a couple of lower scores earlier in the week.
"If we would have played our normal game all week, we
would be right there going into the final round," O'Con
nor said of the Cardinal, whose low score this week has
been a 1 -over 73.
Other teams have had players post much lower scores,
including Southern California, Auburn and Duke, which
all benefited from rounds of 69 yesterday to stay in con-
