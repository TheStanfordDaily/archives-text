WITH I I IK AWARDING of Un

nities major grants lot the 2001-
2002 academic year, we are re
minded ul the uni(jue academic offerings that
Stanford provides to undergraduates. I he
I RO program losters <pialit\ academic work

support to pursue the topits and passions that
drive them, whit li becomes il l< rcasingh impor
tant the more structured Stanford academics
becomes.
At othei univei sities, rarel\ do undergrad
uate students have the chance to < arr\ out
the it own funded research projects. Finan
cial and moral support for undergraduate
t eseai ch often pla\ second fiddle to gr.iduate
work. ()ncc in a while, the) will get some at
tention when thev find a cure lot some ob
scure disease 01 incite a riot, but, otherwise.

undergraduates are usually a second priorit\
undet highly lot used graduate students who
are more likely to bring fame to a university.
At Stanford, the I R() program shows not
onl\ how much interest Stanford has in its
undergraduates, but also the amount ol trust
that the I niversity has in the <|iialit\ of these
students' intellectual pursuits. And the I ni
versit\ is well justified in its confidence. Pre
vious award winners have written hooks
based on their I l\() projects or pursued ic
lated gi aduate studv.
I'liere is something refreshing about this
trust. I lie I R() grants reallv emphasi/e the
faith tli.it the I niversity has in the abilities of
the undergraduate population. Other tini
vei si lies arc reluctant to give so much nione\
to undergiaduales who are just learning
about lhe academic woi Id. Hut the fat I that 7<S
percent of people who applied foi majoi

grants and 7."» percent of people who applied
lot min<>i grants actually received their grant
shows that Stanford has .1 great deal of trust in
the intellectual pursuits of undergraduates.
I he program and Director Laura Sel/nick
should be commended lor increasing the
major award amount to $3,000, a $500 111-
< lease from last vear. In previous wars, some
students — especially those working in devel
oping countries — had been able to finance
the entiicl\ of tlieii projects with $2,500, and
others — like those who conduct research on
campus over the summer — could barely af
ford to pa\ for room and board. I he $500 in
(lease in maximum funding is a step in the
right direction lor students with more expen
sive, but no less valuable, projects.
Also, the I R<) program provides .1 iiuu h
needed break from the structured academic
life at Stanford. .Many students are set on aca-

(leiiii< paths that are difficult to stray from.
Willi breadth and major requirements tak
ing up more and more of students' time, such
as with the possible new year-long Writing
<ind (Iritieal I (linking requirements, there is
rarel) an opportunit) foi undergraduates to
research the issues and ideas that really in
terest them.
I RO grants provide intellectual relief for
inan\ undergraduates by encouraging them
to create .1 research proposal around the
ideas that interest them. Programs like URO
become increasing!) important in university
environments that revolve around highly
structured academic tracks. Pursuing origi
nal research provides a welcome break from
the usual classes. I he program is an impor
tant .ind necessary part of Stanford's aca
demic mission and deserves continued stu
dent, I niversitv and donor support.
