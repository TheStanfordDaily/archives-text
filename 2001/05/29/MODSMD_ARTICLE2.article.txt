### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Anyone who missed Stanford football's emotional
-7-21 upset oyer I exas earlier tins year got two more
chances on Sunday to see the Cardinal overtake ilie
longhorns in similarly dramatic niatch-ups.
But instead ol l)eßonnie I'itts flipping into the end
zone to cap .in unprecedented comeback at Stanford
Stadium, ii wasC '.arlos Qnentin, Ryan (>arko and com
pany swarming the mound at Sunken Diamond in cel
ebration < >1 tlie (Cardinal s third consecutive super-re
gional berili.
( her 2,000 people were on hand Sunda\ night to
witness the culmination of an exhausting two days ol
baseball that included three crucial wins by No. I Stan
ford (40-15) in elimination games.
I he final two ('.ardinal victories against Texas (M
-26) were thrillers with so many twists and turns to them
that no one could have predicted the eventual region
al winner until Oucntin caught the final out of Sun
day's nightcap to give Staniord a l-!t win.
Ii was an unbelievable effort b\ both teams, and 1
don't think you're going to find two better college base
ball games,' head coach Mark Marquess said.
Sophomore Ryan Carko looped a bases-loaded 2-
RBI single just out of the reach of fonghorn second
baseman I im Moss in the top of the eighth inning,
scoring juniors Scott Dragicevich and Arik VanZandt
to give the ('.ardinal a 4-M lead. Stanford had trailed H
-1 heading into the inning, but scored <i run on <i sacri
fice fl\ In junior Chris O'Riordan to make the store 3-
2 before (iarko came to the plate.
(>arkohad been in a similar situation the day before
in a 4-3 loss to the longhorns, when he grounded out
to third base to end the game, and when the (Cardinal
saw its chances of advancing beginning to fade.
I his one was nice to get," said Carko, who was
named the regional's co-Most ()utstanding I'layer and
who also extended his career-high hitting streak to 20
games. "[Saturday s at-bat | didn't really cross my mind
before I went up to bat, but afterwards ii did."
Junior J. 1). Willcox earned the save lor the Cardi
nal. whose pitching stall was extremely thin In the time
of the second game against I exas. While head coach
Mark Marquess had jokingly stated tlie night before
that he would start anyone in the bullpen "whose arm
was still hanging on," the combination of Willcox, ju
nior Mike Wodnicki (">-1) and freshman starter |ohn
Hudgins did an impressive job in holding the long
horns to onl\ four runs.
With the Cardinal leading, 4-3, Willcox made a
game-saving play in the bottom of the eighth inning,

when I exas had the bases loaded. 1 fe snagged a bullet
bit by Kddie Romprey and quickly threw to first base
fora double play that ended the inning and the long
horn scoring threat.
That ball looked as big as a grapefruit and looked
like ii was moving in slow motion," Willcox said ol the
line drive. "I'm just glad it c ame at me and not two feet
to my left or so."
More drama ensued in the lx>ttom of the ninth in
ning when I exas. the designated home team, had the
lung run on first base with two outs and Ben King at
the plate. In the first game of the day, King had
shtx ked the Cardinal with a three-run blast with two
outs in the ninth inning that lon ed the game into extra
innings. I his time, though, Willcox got King to fly oiii
to end the game and extend the Cardinal's run to
()maha .it least one more week.
lhe Cardinal was on the brink of being ousted

from i fie 04-team N( .AA I ournament field on Satur
day af let lc wing a f-'l heart breaker to the 1 onghorns.
I he loss placed Stanford in the loser's bracket of the
double-elimination regional, forc ing it to beat Marist
Saturday night and then to overcome I exas twice on
Sunday.
And, ama/inglv, the ('.ardinal did just that.
After l>eating Marist, 0-0, behind an eight-inning,
seven-hit performance by sophomore pitcher lim
('.unningham (0-0) on Saturday, the squad came out
swinging against the fonghorns in the first game on
Sunday, taking au early 4-0 lead. I exas scored live
runs in the liltli inning before junior Andy I opham hit
his second home ninol the game as the Cardinal coun
tered with five runs ol its own in the sixth, giv ing it a 9-
5 lead.

lhe baseball team celebrates ifs second victory over Texas on Sunday. With the victory, Stanford won its region
and will play in the super-regionals at Sunken Diamond next weekend.
Fans were 011 their feet as the
Cardinal was one strike awav
from winning the first game,
when Longhorn Rvan Hnhele
hit a single to extend what
seemed to be the inevitable. But
with two men on base and Texas
trailing, 9-(i, King ripped a Wod
nicki pitch over the first-base foul
pole for .1 three-run shot that
brought the entire I exas dugout
on to the field in celebration
while many Stanford plavers

protested the call.
"I thought it was foul," said
(hientin, who, along with Mar
quess, ran to the nearest umpire
to state their case.
()nce the game was forced into
extra innings, however, Quentin
came through on his c ham e to be
the game's hero iu the bottom of
the 10th. He hit a bases-loaded
KIU-single to right field that
scored O'kiordan to give the
(lardinal a 10-9 win.
And one hour later, the players,
along with most of the fans, were
back at it again in a regional th.it
never seemed to have an end in
sight. When all was said and clone

ai 8:43 p.m. on Sunday night,
though, 2(> hours, .'11 minutes,
after the ('animal's fate seemed to
be sealed after its first loss to I exas,
Stanford ultimateK prevailed.
"It was a great win for our pro
gram," Marquess said. "I'm very
proud of this group. It's .1 special
group. I didn't expect much from
them, but they keep surprising me."
I I lev will have another ( hance
to surprise Marquess next week
in the super-regionals against
South Carolina. Stanford will
host the best-of-three-game se

lhe baseball team celebrates ifs second victory over Texas on Sunday. With the victory, Stanford won its region
and will play in the super-regionals at Sunken Diamond next weekend.
Fans were 011 their feet as the
Cardinal was one strike awav
from winning the first game,
when Longhorn Rvan Hnhele
hit a single to extend what
seemed to be the inevitable. But
with two men on base and Texas
trailing, 9-(i, King ripped a Wod
nicki pitch over the first-base foul
pole for .1 three-run shot that
brought the entire I exas dugout
on to the field in celebration
while many Stanford plavers

protested the call.
"I thought it was foul," said
(hientin, who, along with Mar
quess, ran to the nearest umpire
to state their case.
()nce the game was forced into
extra innings, however, Quentin
came through on his c ham e to be
the game's hero iu the bottom of
the 10th. He hit a bases-loaded
KIU-single to right field that
scored O'kiordan to give the
(lardinal a 10-9 win.
And one hour later, the players,
along with most of the fans, were
back at it again in a regional th.it
never seemed to have an end in
sight. When all was said and clone

ai 8:43 p.m. on Sunday night,
though, 2(> hours, .'11 minutes,
after the ('animal's fate seemed to
be sealed after its first loss to I exas,
Stanford ultimateK prevailed.
"It was a great win for our pro
gram," Marquess said. "I'm very
proud of this group. It's .1 special
group. I didn't expect much from
them, but they keep surprising me."
I I lev will have another ( hance
to surprise Marquess next week
in the super-regionals against
South Carolina. Stanford will
host the best-of-three-game se
rifs at Sunken Diamond, with the
first game to be played on I ridav
night at 7 p.m.
Anyone who missed Stanford football's emotional
-7-21 upset oyer I exas earlier tins year got two more
chances on Sunday to see the Cardinal overtake ilie
longhorns in similarly dramatic niatch-ups.
But instead ol l)eßonnie I'itts flipping into the end
zone to cap .in unprecedented comeback at Stanford
Stadium, ii wasC '.arlos Qnentin, Ryan (>arko and com
pany swarming the mound at Sunken Diamond in cel
ebration < >1 tlie (Cardinal s third consecutive super-re
gional berili.
( her 2,000 people were on hand Sunda\ night to
witness the culmination of an exhausting two days ol
baseball that included three crucial wins by No. I Stan
ford (40-15) in elimination games.
I he final two ('.ardinal victories against Texas (M
-26) were thrillers with so many twists and turns to them
that no one could have predicted the eventual region
al winner until Oucntin caught the final out of Sun
day's nightcap to give Staniord a l-!t win.
Ii was an unbelievable effort b\ both teams, and 1
don't think you're going to find two better college base
ball games,' head coach Mark Marquess said.
Sophomore Ryan Carko looped a bases-loaded 2-
RBI single just out of the reach of fonghorn second
baseman I im Moss in the top of the eighth inning,
scoring juniors Scott Dragicevich and Arik VanZandt
to give the ('.ardinal a 4-M lead. Stanford had trailed H
-1 heading into the inning, but scored <i run on <i sacri
fice fl\ In junior Chris O'Riordan to make the store 3-
2 before (iarko came to the plate.
(>arkohad been in a similar situation the day before
in a 4-3 loss to the longhorns, when he grounded out
to third base to end the game, and when the (Cardinal
saw its chances of advancing beginning to fade.
I his one was nice to get," said Carko, who was
named the regional's co-Most ()utstanding I'layer and
who also extended his career-high hitting streak to 20
games. "[Saturday s at-bat | didn't really cross my mind
before I went up to bat, but afterwards ii did."
Junior J. 1). Willcox earned the save lor the Cardi
nal. whose pitching stall was extremely thin In the time
of the second game against I exas. While head coach
Mark Marquess had jokingly stated tlie night before
that he would start anyone in the bullpen "whose arm
was still hanging on," the combination of Willcox, ju
nior Mike Wodnicki (">-1) and freshman starter |ohn
Hudgins did an impressive job in holding the long
horns to onl\ four runs.
With the Cardinal leading, 4-3, Willcox made a
game-saving play in the bottom of the eighth inning,

when I exas had the bases loaded. 1 fe snagged a bullet
bit by Kddie Romprey and quickly threw to first base
fora double play that ended the inning and the long
horn scoring threat.
That ball looked as big as a grapefruit and looked
like ii was moving in slow motion," Willcox said ol the
line drive. "I'm just glad it c ame at me and not two feet
to my left or so."
More drama ensued in the lx>ttom of the ninth in
ning when I exas. the designated home team, had the
lung run on first base with two outs and Ben King at
the plate. In the first game of the day, King had
shtx ked the Cardinal with a three-run blast with two
outs in the ninth inning that lon ed the game into extra
innings. I his time, though, Willcox got King to fly oiii
to end the game and extend the Cardinal's run to
()maha .it least one more week.
lhe Cardinal was on the brink of being ousted

from i fie 04-team N( .AA I ournament field on Satur
day af let lc wing a f-'l heart breaker to the 1 onghorns.
I he loss placed Stanford in the loser's bracket of the
double-elimination regional, forc ing it to beat Marist
Saturday night and then to overcome I exas twice on
Sunday.
And, ama/inglv, the ('.ardinal did just that.
After l>eating Marist, 0-0, behind an eight-inning,
seven-hit performance by sophomore pitcher lim
('.unningham (0-0) on Saturday, the squad came out
swinging against the fonghorns in the first game on
Sunday, taking au early 4-0 lead. I exas scored live
