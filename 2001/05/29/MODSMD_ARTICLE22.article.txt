AAATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Junior Lauren Kalvaria hits a forehand earlier in the season. Kalvaria lost to teammate Laura Granville in the finals
of the NCAA Singles Championships in Stone Mountain, Ga., over the weekend.
I tried everything today, and
she had an answer," Kalvaria said.
I o win a title, I wanted to play the
best player, and today I did. She is
iiu redible. I tried to make her play
just one more hall each time, and
she did. When ni\ shoelace broke
in the second set, I think she may
have gotten her wind back a little. 1
thought I might have had an
upper hand in the third set. but 1
couldn't get it totli.it point. She has
been an awesome teammate these
past two \e.ns ,im(l has taught me
so much. 1 just congratulate heron
.ill she h as accomplished."
Kalvaria finished the season with

an 11-1 record in postseason match
es and a 39-4 season record overall.
" I ve been real surprised at how
the team has played in singles
competition," Stanford head
coach Lele Forood said. "1 knew
we were playing well because of
our team success, but to do as well
as we have individually has been a
pleasant shock. Obviouslv, Laura
came in as the favorite, but
Kalvaria has had a wonderful
tournament. She's shown people
that she's moved to the next level."
After the match, (>ranville an
nounced her plans to turn pro this
summer. She finishes the season
with a 40-1 record and on a 2.'i
mati h winning streak. In her two-
Near Stanford career, (Iranville
earned a 93-3 (.909) singles
let ord.

"This taps off my college ca
reer," Granville said. "It would be
difficult tor me to come back and
do this again ... I have to go back
and take final exams. I hen, 1 have
to have my wisdom teeth out. I will
probably start playing profession
ally in July or soon thereafter."
In the doubles finals, Granville
and junior Gabby Lastra It'll to
Florida's No. 4 tandem of Whitney
Lailio and Jessica Lelinliott in a 4-
6, 6-1, 6-3 upset. Before knocking
