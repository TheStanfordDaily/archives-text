### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
For I lie lii si time in seven years, ihe
Stanford men's tennis team was held
without .1 title in NCAA team, singles or
doubles < ompetition.
I 'hat happened after the llth-rankcd
sophomore doubles team of David Mat -
tin and Scon 1 jpsky were knot ked
out of individual contention on Sunday
by the se< ond-seeded <ieorgia pair ol Ma
tias Boeker and Iravis Parrott in the
semifinals of ihe N( .\.\ I )oubles (Ihampi
onships.
In the team competition, the top-seed
ed Stanford team's hopes had ended in
the quarterfinals against Tennessee when
the Volunteers capitalized on senior tri
captain Alex Kim's absence, upsetting the
Cardinal, 4-2.
Willi live entrants in the individual
singles and doubles tournaments that
started last I hursday and Friday,
chances were high that Stanford would
be able to capture at Ic.isi one individual
title.
But n just wasn't the Cardinal's year.
Alter the top-ranked and second-seed
ed Kim (20-5) bowed out in the first
round of singles play, 53rd-ranked Mar
tin (25-13) immediately followed suit.
I his left 1 Nth-ranked K.J. 1 lippensteel

(35-N) as ihe lone Cardinal in the singles
draw.
After defeating 29th-rankecl 1 iago
Kufloni of Auburn iu the first round,
Ifipi jensleel faced 43rd-ranked I race
Fielding ol I exas ('.hristian.
In <i duel between two powerful pl.iv
ers, I lippensteel dropped the first set be
fore rallying to a third set.
I lippensteel was down 3-1 in the third
sei. but lound a second wind and came
ba< k to win the sc( olid-round man h, TO,
0-4,6-4.
In a tournament where six of the top
eight seeds fell in the lust two rounds, it
was almost no surprise that lop-seeded
Marco Baron ol Mississippi Slate was
stunned by the impressive junior IVter
llatidoyo from I'ennessee in the second
round.
I bis set up a third-round malch-iip
between the 25th-ranked llandovo and
I lippensteel.
In a small touch of vindication. I lip
pensteel was able to roll over I landovo, 0-
2. 0-2. llandovo played an integral part
in I lit- Volunteers vie lory over the (Cardi

Sophomore Dave Martin hits a shot earlier this season. Martin teamed with fellow sophomore
Scott Lipsky to advance to the semifinals of the NCAA Doubles Championships this weekend.
I lippensteel (21 -6).
After demolishing the 18th
rankcd Purdue duo ot |ason Mar
shall and Dan Swan, Kim and
Hippensteel were unfortunate
enough to have to play Virginia's
Huntley Montgomery and Brian
Valialy, the top doubles team in
the nation.
Kim's career .is a college tennis
player ended as he and Hippen
steel were unable to pnil off the
upset in the quarterfinals. Mont
gomery and Valialy won a close
three-setter, (>-1, 4-(i, 6-4.
"[ Ihe past few days were] a
huge disappointment to me," Kim
said. "I feel responsible for letting
the team down. Knowing that lias
been really tough."
Martin and l.ipskv, who had
the best doubles record on the
(Cardinal squad but were not ex
pected to be a factor in the doubles
tournament, quieted many
doubters as tlie\ coasted through
the first three rounds with
straight-set wins.
Included in their solid run
were wins against 19th-ranked

Javier Taborga and Aaron I alai i
co of Notre Dame, I2th-ranked
Michael Kogan and Mikko \'ilja
ueu ot I ulane and second
ranked Anier Delic and Gravdon
()liver of Illinois.
However, because ot the wa\
the individual tournament is
tramped into a tight three-day
schedule, Martin and Lipsk\ ran
out of steam in their second match
on Saturday, a semifinal loss to the
Georgia pair, 7-5, 6-0.
Martin and Lipsky actually
had a great chance to take the
first set. but with Mat tin serving
at 5-6, he lost his concentration,
double faulting three times in a
row and giving Boeker and Par
rot t the lead.
"We had some opportunities in
the first set, Lipsky said. "They
got some big shots when tliev
needed them and played well.
1 hev deserved to win."
Martin said he believed his
blunder in the first set was the
turning point in the matth.
"We started really well and had
the opportunity to break early,"
he said. " 1 "he biggest thing obvi
ously for us was when 1 double
faulted three times at 5-6. It was
really tough to rebound after that.
We got down and discouraged,

aiui I think ii hurt us 111 the end."
Although the Cardinal ended
the season empty-handed, head
eoaeh Dick (>ould saw some
promising play from Hippensteel.
Martin and l.ipskv.
By making it past the second
round, Hippensteel was named
an .-Mi-American in singles lor the
second year in a row. Although
Kim tell in the first round, he
also earned the same honor
based on his high seed. Finally,
Martin and l.ipskv earned then
first ever All-American distinc
tion in doubles.
At the end, Georgia came
through with a Stanford-like per
formance, with a team title, and a
singles and doubles champion in
Boeker.
I he third-seeded Boeker de
feated Virginia's Brian Vahalv, (>-
2, 6-4, to complete one of the
more dominating singles tourna

top it off, Boeker I'arrott contin
ued on to beat third-seeded |ohan
