Stanford men's tennis team was held
without .1 title in NCAA team, singles or

sophomore doubles team of David Mat -
tin and Scon 1 jpsky were knot ked
out of individual contention on Sunday
by the se< ond-seeded <ieorgia pair ol Ma
tias Boeker and Iravis Parrott in the
semifinals of ihe N( .\.\ I )oubles (Ihampi
onships.
In the team competition, the top-seed
ed Stanford team's hopes had ended in
the quarterfinals against Tennessee when
the Volunteers capitalized on senior tri
captain Alex Kim's absence, upsetting the
Cardinal, 4-2.
Willi live entrants in the individual
singles and doubles tournaments that
started last I hursday and Friday,
chances were high that Stanford would
be able to capture at Ic.isi one individual
title.
But n just wasn't the Cardinal's year.
Alter the top-ranked and second-seed
ed Kim (20-5) bowed out in the first
round of singles play, 53rd-ranked Mar
tin (25-13) immediately followed suit.
I his left 1 Nth-ranked K.J. 1 lippensteel

(35-N) as ihe lone Cardinal in the singles
draw.

ers, I lippensteel dropped the first set be
fore rallying to a third set.
I lippensteel was down 3-1 in the third
sei. but lound a second wind and came
ba< k to win the sc( olid-round man h, TO,
0-4,6-4.
In a tournament where six of the top
eight seeds fell in the lust two rounds, it
was almost no surprise that lop-seeded
Marco Baron ol Mississippi Slate was
stunned by the impressive junior IVter
llatidoyo from I'ennessee in the second
round.
I bis set up a third-round malch-iip
between the 25th-ranked llandovo and
I lippensteel.
In a small touch of vindication. I lip
pensteel was able to roll over I landovo, 0-
2. 0-2. llandovo played an integral part
in I lit- Volunteers vie lory over the (Cardi
nal l>\ walloping sophomore Ryan llavi
