"WC haven't shot 18-ovei for IS holes in

Caroline ()'Connor said. "Nevei in mv
yvildest dreams would I evei have imagined
that we would he 111111 h more than (i-ovei

can't relive this round; it's too painful."
I hose sentiments reverberated among
all of the players aftei Friday's round, es
pecially for Kccver and llomevcr. whose
collegiate careers came to an end when
they tapped out on tlieii final hole.
"It's just su< h ,t hard yvav foi the two to

Stanford tried desperately to gain mo
mentum. but a combination of bad link,
along with trying to gel used to the
Bermuda Crass, ballet I any small run.
"For lour rounds, we tried to
gel tilings turned around,"
O'Connor said. "We'd start to
see things going our way, and
then they would he gone."
Rowton, who placed 25th
alter rounds of 711-74-74-77
(+ 10) was the (Cardinal's top fin
