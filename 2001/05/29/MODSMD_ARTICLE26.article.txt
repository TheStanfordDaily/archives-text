mavbe 1 should sii< k to this.
(Camarena's junioi scar proved
successful. Slit- won I lie* stale prep
down in the shot put with a 50-1 I
.'V4 throw that was the nation's
leading prep in.uk that season
and the California Inlcrst holaslit
Federation's third-best all-time el
lort. I hat summer took liei to the
IJSAIT Junioi National (champi
onship in Denton, lex., where
she finished set ond, then on to the

l la.. where she raptured gold.
I he next year, slit- had hoped to
repeal as the stale champion in
the shot put — she finished third,
but raptured the discus down.
She traveled with the I nited
States junioi National team as an
alternate to the Junioi Pan-Am
(..lines in (Canada.
I lei successes made liei a mu< li
soiighl-altci recruit, but ( Caniarc
na had long leaned toward the
(Cardinal.
"It was a dream come true
when I was recruited In [Stan

Robert |\\'en| is a great coach,
and he knows what lie s talking
about. I saw ili.it lie lias a lot to
ollci me here, and so l;u it's work
ing out well."
It rcitainh looks that wa\ from
the niai k (Camarena has made on
the Stanlord retold books. She
shattered Patty Pin pui s l l-sear
old freshman record of 50-9, and
her throw at the Pat -10 meet is the
second-best all-time eHort In a
Cardinal woman. Alici accom
plishing all t>f this in a stellar t ollc
giate debut, Camarena still sa\s
slit' feels I hi time at St.m fort I holt Is
plenty to shoot loi.
"There are gills throwing 58
feet right now in college, and I in

II Camarena were to accom
plish her 00-loot gt>al, she would
far eclipse the best marks ol all
past Cardinal competitors, but
raising the level of competition on
the Stanlord squad is definitely in
her sights.
"Just this year, we had liveorsix
women coming in lor the throw
ers, and that's huge," Camarena
said. " I hey had live [women

definitely another element that a

around — throws, jumps, every
thing. I hope the distance-running
siercotvpeol Stanlord will come to
an cntl soon, and we'll just be
known as a great all-around track
program."
I he distance runners will cer
tainly get milt li ol the nation's at

1,500 meters in redshirt senior
Sally Clynn and in the 5,000 me

laps around llaywartl Field in
I hursdav s semifinal races, Ca
marena will step into the ring to
take liei lit st shot at the collegiate

wavs as a prep, (Camarena oilers a
lot of promise lot a Stanlord squad
just beginning to tome on as

last lap of the 1,500.
(Camarena said she hopes that
she will be able to help the (Cardi

MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily I lie
Freshman Jillian Camarena, a shot-putter on the Stanford
women's track team, will be crucial when the Cardinal competes
at the NCAA Championship starting Thursday.
until im junioi yeai ili.il I thought,
mavbe 1 should sii< k to this.
(Camarena's junioi scar proved
successful. Slit- won I lie* stale prep
down in the shot put with a 50-1 I
.'V4 throw that was the nation's
leading prep in.uk that season
and the California Inlcrst holaslit
Federation's third-best all-time el
lort. I hat summer took liei to the
IJSAIT Junioi National (champi
onship in Denton, lex., where
she finished set ond, then on to the
|umoi Pan-Am (ianies in I ampa,
l la.. where she raptured gold.
I he next year, slit- had hoped to
repeal as the stale champion in
the shot put — she finished third,
but raptured the discus down.
She traveled with the I nited
States junioi National team as an
alternate to the Junioi Pan-Am
(..lines in (Canada.
I lei successes made liei a mu< li
soiighl-altci recruit, but ( Caniarc
na had long leaned toward the
(Cardinal.
"It was a dream come true
when I was recruited In [Stan
lord)," she said. "| I brows coach |
Robert |\\'en| is a great coach,
and he knows what lie s talking
about. I saw ili.it lie lias a lot to
ollci me here, and so l;u it's work
ing out well."
It rcitainh looks that wa\ from
the niai k (Camarena has made on
the Stanlord retold books. She
shattered Patty Pin pui s l l-sear
old freshman record of 50-9, and
her throw at the Pat -10 meet is the
second-best all-time eHort In a
Cardinal woman. Alici accom
plishing all t>f this in a stellar t ollc
giate debut, Camarena still sa\s
slit' feels I hi time at St.m fort I holt Is
plenty to shoot loi.
"There are gills throwing 58
feet right now in college, and I in
delinitcK looking at that." Ca
marena said. "Mavbe nt>t next veai
— I'll |u si have to lake little steps
but definitely In m\ scnioi yeai
I want to gel ii|> to that Iii«^ll colle
giate level |oi | posl-tollcgialc level

ol throwing arountl 00 leet."
II Camarena were to accom
plish her 00-loot gt>al, she would
far eclipse the best marks ol all
past Cardinal competitors, but
raising the level of competition on
the Stanlord squad is definitely in
her sights.
"Just this year, we had liveorsix
women coming in lor the throw
ers, and that's huge," Camarena
said. " I hey had live [women
ihrowcrs| total last year. I think it's
definitely another element that a
team needs il they want it> win
NCAAs. I hev have to have it, all
around — throws, jumps, every
thing. I hope the distance-running
siercotvpeol Stanlord will come to
an cntl soon, and we'll just be
known as a great all-around track
program."
I he distance runners will cer
tainly get milt li ol the nation's at
tention tins weekend. I he Cardi
nal boasts the No. 2 seed in the
1,500 meters in redshirt senior
Sally Clynn and in the 5,000 me
ters in sophomore Lauren Flesh
man. However, while Clynn runs
laps around llaywartl Field in
I hursdav s semifinal races, Ca
marena will step into the ring to
take liei lit st shot at the collegiate
title. Aliei proving her winning
wavs as a prep, (Camarena oilers a
lot of promise lot a Stanlord squad
just beginning to tome on as
si long in the licid as it docs in the
last lap of the 1,500.
(Camarena said she hopes that
she will be able to help the (Cardi
nal continue to build its team and
mavbe attract some big ret i nils to
I lie I.ii in. It all cat 1\ appears to I it
working — VVeii has recruited a
bumper crop of llirt nvers to Angel I
Field next yeai.
Hut that is .ill lai in the future.
It's like (Camarena sass, "little
steps" until \ou rcat h voui goal.
I he next step lor (Camarena
will tome I hursda\ night, when
she steps into the ring at I la\ wart I
Field to t oinpete with the nation's
lust collegiate throwers in Irtml ol
a crowd expected to I tip 1 0.000.
(Cardinal ti.uk and licit! Lans
