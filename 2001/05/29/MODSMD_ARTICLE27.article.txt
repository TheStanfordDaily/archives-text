### 
Ml l AVAI KLK (AP) — Bloody from an elbow to the
mouth, Allen Iverson swallowed hard and finished off
the Bucks.
Scoring II of his team's final 13 points, including
seven in a row after he was hit in the mouth In Ray
Allen. Iverson was the MVP of the fourth quarter yes
terday as the Philadelphia 7<iers beat Milwaukee 89-83
to tie the Lastern ( onlerence finals at t w< > games apiece.
I didn't think the refs were going to let me back in
the game because I was spitting up so much blood. I
was trying to stop the bleeding but it wouldn't stop, so
I kept in\ mouth dosed and swallowed the blood when
it filled up," he said.
Iverson s latest effort was more 1 )raculian than I Icr
culean, typifying how the 7tiers showed a sense of ur
gency and desperation that the Bucks were sorely lac k
ing.
Philadelphia also got big contributions from Dikem
bc Mutombo and I vrone llill while shutting down
Milwaukee s offense over the final eight minutes.
Iverson, who sat out (lame .'1 with a sore left hip
joint, missed I () straight shots at one point and finished
10-tbr-32 from the field for 28 points. But he did
enough in the fourth quarter to make his early shoot
ing woes insignificant.
"As kid .is inv butt was hurting, I knew if 1 could
suck that up I could siu k this np," Iverson said.
I he /tiers held the Bucks to just one basket over a
neatly seven-minute stretch of the fiii;ll quarter and
won going awa\.
Milwaukee fans booed the home team .is they left

the court, frustrated by vet another display of the
Bucks plaving poorly right when they had a c hance to
take control of a playoff series.
Philadelphia's victory ensured that the NBA Finals
will not start until June (i — meaning the Western ('on
ference c hampion Los Angeles Likei s will have had 10
days between games.
Of much more immediate importance is the out
come of this series, which is now essentially a best-of
three. (iame 5 is Wednesday night at Philadelphia.
"All this game shows is that the two teams are pretlv
equal and its going to be a great series," Bucks coach
(ieorge Karl said.
Iverson played the entire game except for the final
10 seconds of the third quarter and had eight assists,
five rebounds and two steals. Mutombo h.id 17 points,
15 rebounds and four blocks, and 1 lill — whose father
is seriously ill in a Cincinnati hospital — added 11
points.
It was clear right from the outset tli.it Iverson had
his quickness back as he looked nothing like the plavcr
who moved through (iame 2 at half-speed. Sprinting
and accelerating like the Iverson of old. he was able to
start and stop on a dime and use his crossover dribble
and quick first step to lose one-on-one defenders.
Iverson showed off I us speed on one of the key pla\ s
of the game, a drive around (ilenn Robinson fora run
ning bank shot with 3:00 left that gave the Sixers an 80-
75 lead. Allen missed .i jumper on Milwaukee's next
possession, and Iverson then drew three defenders as
he drove the lane.
