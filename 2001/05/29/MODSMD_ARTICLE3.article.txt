# Grad draw leaves many out in cold

### MELISANDE MIDDLETON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Only 73 percent of graduate students received
housing in this year's graduate student housing
draw, ihe lowest number ever. Representing an
increase of 39 percent compared to last year. 1,370
continuing students were not assigned to on-cam
pus housing. I his number is 300 students higher
than the record of 1,070 in the 1999 lottery.
I he increase in unhoused students is due to
the fact that the total number of housing applica
tions increased by 1 1 percent this year, from
4,627 to 5,129.
I odd Benson, director of housing assignment
services, attributed this high demand to the tight
oil-campus housing market.
"The rents around Stanford are really high.
I hey're higher than they were three or lour years
ago," he said. I here is also a large demand lor the
new graduate student apartments on campus,
such as the new studio apartments in Kscondido
Village, according to Benson.
Almost half of the continuing students — both
single and in couples — losi housing in the lottery
because all new students and families Willi chil
dren are guaranteed oil-campus housing. Fifty
two percent of continuing student couples were
not assigned, compared to Hi percent of continu
ing single students.
"Losing the housing lottery has very negative
implications for the stability, living conditions and
productivity of graduate students." said Graduate
Student Council Chair Filipe Santos, a doctoral
candidate in management science and engineer
ing. "With the existing off-campus housing mar
ket. it is impossible for graduate students to afford
housing on the current stipends level. For exam
ple, a typical new lease fora 1 -bedroom apartment
costs about $1,500 a month, which is more than
the total income of most graduate students."
I'lie first graduate housing c risis occurred in
1997, when more than 700 students did not gel
housing. Graduate students protested on the

increase of 39 percent compared to last year. 1,370
continuing students were not assigned to on-cam
pus housing. I his number is 300 students higher
than the record of 1,070 in the 1999 lottery.
I he increase in unhoused students is due to
the fact that the total number of housing applica
tions increased by 1 1 percent this year, from
4,627 to 5,129.
I odd Benson, director of housing assignment
services, attributed this high demand to the tight
oil-campus housing market.
"The rents around Stanford are really high.
I hey're higher than they were three or lour years
ago," he said. I here is also a large demand lor the
new graduate student apartments on campus,
such as the new studio apartments in Kscondido
Village, according to Benson.
Almost half of the continuing students — both
single and in couples — losi housing in the lottery
because all new students and families Willi chil
dren are guaranteed oil-campus housing. Fifty
two percent of continuing student couples were
not assigned, compared to Hi percent of continu
ing single students.
"Losing the housing lottery has very negative
implications for the stability, living conditions and
productivity of graduate students." said Graduate
Student Council Chair Filipe Santos, a doctoral
candidate in management science and engineer
ing. "With the existing off-campus housing mar
ket. it is impossible for graduate students to afford
housing on the current stipends level. For exam
ple, a typical new lease fora 1 -bedroom apartment
costs about $1,500 a month, which is more than
the total income of most graduate students."
I'lie first graduate housing c risis occurred in
1997, when more than 700 students did not gel
housing. Graduate students protested on the
