Only 73 percent of graduate students received
housing in this year's graduate student housing
draw, ihe lowest number ever. Representing an
increase of 39 percent compared to last year. 1,370
continuing students were not assigned to on-cam
pus housing. I his number is 300 students higher

not assigned, compared to Hi percent of continu
ing single students.
"Losing the housing lottery has very negative
implications for the stability, living conditions and
productivity of graduate students." said Graduate
Student Council Chair Filipe Santos, a doctoral
candidate in management science and engineer
ing. "With the existing off-campus housing mar
ket. it is impossible for graduate students to afford
housing on the current stipends level. For exam
ple, a typical new lease fora 1 -bedroom apartment
costs about $1,500 a month, which is more than
the total income of most graduate students."
