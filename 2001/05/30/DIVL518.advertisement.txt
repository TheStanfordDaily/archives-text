Thad Carhart, a Stanford Alumnus,
never realized there was a gap in
his life until he happened upon
Destorges Pianos, a demure little
shopfront in his Paris neighborhood
that seemed to want to hide rather
than advertise its wares. In this
engaging memoir, Carhart tells of
how an introduction from one of the
store's clients gets him into this store,
where he discovers a magical space
crowded with pianos of all makes
and vintages and embarks on a
wonderful friendship with the shop's
owner, Luc. The Piano Shop on
the Left Hank is the perfect hook
for music lovers, or anyone
who longs to recapture a lost passion.
