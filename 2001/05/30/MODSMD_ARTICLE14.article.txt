1968
()n May !W, 1908, Ihe Daily printed a letter about
the Stanford (bourse Review.
" Ihe Stanford Course Review Supplement is
both tasteless and unnecessary. ('.ourse evaluation is
most easily made verbally among interested stu
dents; residence libraries might profitably contain
printed evaluations as well. But as a public report
which includes specific criticisms of our professors is
likely to embarrass victims.
"And il the aim of the review is objectivity and not
an attempt to dc( ry the personalities of the profes
sors, why include stub comments as 'in love with
himself and his deeds?'
"And is it not presumptuous to declare that a pro
lessor 'will not remain here il he does not acquire
some teaching and personal qualities?* "
Bottom line: Guess this print course guide was a
little better than the online one.
