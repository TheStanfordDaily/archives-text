"Through m at In 20 years ol
woi k, we sui'ceeded in determin

atoms in the RNA polymerase,"
Romberg said. "()ur latest wot k. to

RNA polymerase is important
to transcription because even
cell in the both ( ontains the same
genetic inlot niation in its DNA.
I he pol\ merase tletermines

Ironi DNA into RNA and made
into proteins.
"Roger lias sik < ceded at solving
one ol the largest and most (entral

structures in molecular biology,"
said Michael l.cyitt, chair ol the
structural biol<>gA tlepat tincut. "He
did this without being trained in N
ra\ c rystallography. Five years ago,
no one in the lieltl believed lie had
a chance < >1 suet ess."
As a graduate student in chem
istry. Kornberg devised a method
lot in.iking crystals ol scarce and
unstable proteins. He established
bis own laboratory at Stanford in
the 11170 sand perfected this
method, using crystallography to
discover proteins' three-dimen
sional structure.
Philip h/vo. dean ol the Mcdit al
School, described Kornberg as "a
true luminary."
"l)r. Romberg's research is also
evidence tb.it challenges that seem
impossible to some < an be successes
