SI AN FORI) SKT A nev\ record last
week. Full\ 2!i percent <>l continuing
graduate students—a record
students — did not receive on-cainpus
housing in the graduate student housing lot
tery. I he problem is the result ol increases in
the nuinhei ol students who applied foi I lous
ing and high rental prices in the sin rounding
area. Though the I nivcrsit\ is conunilted lo
long-term solutions ol building more apart
ment units on campus, it must take immediate
action to ensure that graduate students do not
end up homeless oi paying astronomic all\
high rent l<»r oil-campus housing solutions.
Obviously, Mousing is a perennial issue al
Stanford and in the greater San Franc isc o Ka\
Area. I he economic boom has generated
tremendous wealth and exlremeh high rents
in the Peninsula. More recentlv. the economic

downtin n grabbed headlines with gloom and
doom forecasts, and, while the stock market
obvioush took notice of the predictions, the
housing market—at least in the immediate
Stanford area — all but laughed at sugges
tions of recession. Prices for coveted one-bed
room apartments remain too high for the av
erage graduate student on stipends.
I he housing problem is espec iall\ pressing
lor Stanford because, < learlv, the I niversii\
hopes to atlrac I the best and hi ightesl among
graduate students. I lu-I niversitv responded
to similar problems for facultx members b\
building subsidized complexes on campus.
I'he same concern that the l : niversitv has

uate students, who often come out of I licit un
dergraduate vears in heaw debt. Stanford
11 nist sweeten the benefits package if n wants

to continue to recruit and retain the most
competitive fac ult\ and students.
I lie obvious, and necessary, long-term so
lution is to build more housing units on c am
pus. We commend the Universit\ for re
sponding to the problem l>\ construc ting 500
new studios, but 1 1 lis is not enough. According
to estimates, the units w ill be finished In fall of
2002. Because the demand foi oil-campus
housing is estimated to increase in the next
lew vears, it is wise lor Stanford to prepare in
advance.
Still, building new units now will not help
ease (he housing crime h foi the next academ
ic vear. Main graduate students stand to sul
fei from the situation. I nivcrsit\ President
John I lennessN lias announced plans to in
< lease the numhci ol oil-campus subsidized
housing to 000 units. We applaud llennessN

for iliis decision, hut also recogni/e that there
are about 200 students who will not receive
subsidized housing and 2,000 more who did
not apply for the lottery.
Moreover, the 300 housing subsidies ol
$275 per month will not be enough to solve
the problem. Kven with the proposed sub
sides, about 1,900 students will not benefit.
Stanford must either suppl\ the extra money
for direct subsidies and oH'-campus units or
seek other, more creative solutions to the
problem. (Graduate students should not be
forced to live in trailers or transfer to a uni
versity with better housing options.
Ihe University should and must make
graduate housing a priority in its agenda.
After all, no one wants to see graduate stu
dents camping out in White l'la/a in protest,
but, at this point, who could blame them?
