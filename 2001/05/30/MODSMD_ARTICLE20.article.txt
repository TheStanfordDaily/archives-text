# LET FRIEDOM RING
## Of bikes and endings...

My 1 111 .11 was supposed
to becpii It was supposed to
transcend all columns that
have lome before it. B\ dis
playing exceptional humor, tantalizing
imagery and sharing a memorable life
lesson. I was going to wow in\ readers
with one last opinionated Inn rah.
I was tossing around ambitious topics
in my head lor this week's finale, iih hid
ing "Losing Our Freedom ol Spec,"
"The Boer Wat's Impact on the fall ol
the British Fmpirc" and even the ililli-

cult "Dating .11 Stan
ford.'' I lie possibilities
were* limitless.
And then my world
was thrown into com
plete disarray.
My hike was stolen.
I Ins wasn't your or
dinary bicycle. I his
was the metallic blue-

green Specialized Kockhoppei ni\ par
ents gave me eight vears ago on the oc
casion ol mv bar mit/vah. I bis w;is the
very bike that gathered dust in our
garage from the day I got mv driver's li
cense to the dav we pat ked the cat lot
college.
I bis vs.is the scratc bed, scpieakv, cob
web-ridden bike that had been with me
.it Stanford lor four long \e.us. Man\ ol
its reflectors .md accessories were miss
ing. and the handlebar grips were worn
down to the underlying metal. It still h.id
the faded blue stu ker 011 its frame from
its sunimci m the Stern 11.ill storage
basement.
I his deteriorating bike had staved b\
my side as friends' bikes came and
went —victims to either the .mm ol
bike -snatching vans scouring out cam
pus or the (dreaded) Salvation Ai my.
I his bike staved with me until the mo
ment I emerged delirious from 0111 base
ball te am's emotional Friday night vie lo
ry at Sunken I)iamotid.
It was gone. It had been taken from
me. Worst ol all. I would probabl) never
see it again.
As I trudged home slowlv from the
game. I found unsell doing what mam
seniors have done these past lew weeks. I
began asking wliv. No. not, "Why does
this lettei sav I don't have enough units
to complete my major?" or "Win did the
Career Development ('.enter burn down
before I could find a job?" (Although
those are both vcrv valid questions). I
started to grapple with even loughet is
sues. Let me explain.

Mv bicvcle's thelt was more than jusi a
firsthand example ol Stanford's inosi
prevalent t nine, lake any good student
ol literature would point out, ilie theft
was symbolic. Ii represented in\ situa
tion in a largei < onlexi. Sure, iu\ bike -
the object I rode lioni "Jewish man
hood" .it age l.'i to "legal" adulthood at
age 21 —was taken Ironi me. But with
gi ad nation appi o.k lung, something I )ig
gei — namely, Stanford — is about to
slip from niv grasp as well.
Losing both m\ bike and Stanford at
the same time seems sii angel \ appropri
ate. Il s like ilie end ol an era, and I am
being (breed to move on. But I'm not
readv to let go.
\\ li\ is letting go so difficult?
We allow the constants in our lives
the people, plates and things to which
we grow accustomed — define who we
are We become attached to the lamiliar
it\ ol these objet is and the <le lai to iden
tic ilie\ provide us It's not eas\ to let go
ol the comfort of routine.
I mil Friday, I was a Stanford student
and Dail\ columnist riding a specialized
mountain bike, and that felt right. lo
inorrow. the "columnist" tag will sud
denly be gone. In at ouple of weeks, the
"Stanford student" label will, like mv
bike, disappear. I will have to let go ol
the place I've grown to know and love.
But will tli.it change who I am?
Fvcr hear the expression. "You can
take the man out ol ilie armv. but you
can never take the ai niv out ol the man?"
Well, assume "man" = "student,"
"army" = "Stanford" and recompile.
I he Stanford experience will sta\ with
us always. We will always share a deep
connection with the Farm.
A couple ol days ago, I walked to the
Quad under a bright a/ure sk\. I out ists
toting expensive cameras ambled past,
conversing in foreign tongues. I hex
snapped pictures of tlieii children in
front of Memorial Church, smiling
proudly while envisioning the photo
album's caption: "Future Stanford stu
dent." We both took time to admire the
countless arches capped l>\ red-tile roofs,
the palm trees blowing in the warm
breeze, the shimmering mosai< looming
at the < enter of it all. I hey were in awe.
I was at home.
