housing lutes.
Beyond the issue ol (uirness, we also need
to consider the l>eiicfit to the I nivcrsit\ thut
housed fraternities provide eompured to
the average sell-op Row house. IVople
make lun ol fraternities ull the time, hut
most ol us have gone to drink und dunce at
a fraternity party ut leust once. I rutei nih
putties provide u relutivelv sule and con
trolled atmosphere where the hordes can
drink and socialize. Free crapp\ lx*cr and

waiting t«» sec who gets to have their stom

ignoring housed sororities because I have
nothing to s.i\ about that issue uselul to my

Compare this to \<>ur average Row
house. I'Aiept foi a lew unit|tie houses like
Fin banted Brtxcoli Forest and Lambda
\u. Row houses, especially self-ops, serve
no benelii to the largei Stanford communi
t\. Row houses teach luckv sophomores
how to disappeat into two-room doubles
anil beionie antisocial. Row houses let se
nioi s work on their theses without the tlis
ti.h lions i»l fun and human contact. Row
houses are a iuim ken of Residential Educa
tion. I low main great ex-lreslmian resident
assistants burn out and apply to the Row?
I he Row is where good RAs go to die. I Ins
isn't (air either, but il is a reality.
Why should we protect these houses,
two-room doubles and all, when they make
us lorgcl how to meet new people and have
lun like we did in our lreslunan dormito
ries? I'll ratliei give fraternities more hous
ing so that llie\ can give us more beer,
rather than let luckv sophomores and se
niors hide away on the Row and be useless
to even-one else. I rusi me. I know — I've
been useless for the past three years.

\notha u\ii of otwainpus interviews

lias come .iikl go 11 c, and, once again, main
seniors art* complaining about the discon
nect betweenthe('.arcei Development('en
ter's policies and student needs. The OX'.
\\ eh site st.nes its goals ol career counseling
and |ol) placement, but students are often
disappointed with the limited support the
(enter gives to students applying to compa
nies from outside the Ha\ Area. An orga
nized lorn in is necessarv to create a dialogue
between students and the administration to
improve channels oi communication and
ci eate awareness ol the ( enter's oflcrings.
Also limiting the (.1)( s ellet tiveness was
the blazing conll.igration that scon lied
walls .md furniture and melted computers
throughout the building, reaching temper
atures upwards of 12(K) degrees Fahren
heit. Aside from blocking entrance to jybless
seniors lor at least a month, the lire de
stroyed countless posters, job advertise
ments and interview schedules as it blazed
away with a violent white-hot (lame, horri

and rediK ing most ol its contents to a heap
ol smoldering. ( hai red rubble.
Simply put, toreac h lis potential as an or

OX' will have to overcome both the alien
ation ol students looking lor jobs in other
parts of the country and the searing inferno
