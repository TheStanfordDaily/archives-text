1 here li.isn't been mm li said about
tht' Stanford women's track and fit-Id
team since its third-place finish at the
Pacific 10 Conference Championship
in Berkeley over a week ago. I he su
perlatives allotted for women's colle
giate track and field in new spapers and
magazines have mostly been lor the
spotlight-grabbing I CI.A and South
ern (California squads, who are favored
to i'lash for the national title.
But in the silence of the last week,
the Stanlbrd women have gone about
their business, qualifying .1 school
record 10 women to the NCAA (Cham
pionships and line-tuning I licit alread\
line form before l uesday morning's
flight to Kugene, ()t t\. lot the meet that
runs from toda\ through Saturday.
Expect that silence to end soon.
"Once we get up there, there's
going to be a lot ofenergy and a lot ol
noise from the Stanford section,"
freshman shotput sensation (illian
Camarena predicted before the team

left on I uesclay.
fhe Hayward Field crowd, project
ed at 10,000, will have its eyes on the
Cardinal, which boasts the No. 2 seed
in the 1,500 meters in seniot Sall\
Clvnn and in the 3,000 meters with
sophomore Lauren Fleshman, the
American junior rec:orcl holder .it that
distance.
I he Stanford contingent also in
cludes sophomore Kathleen Don
agliue, the reigning national junior
champion m the pole vault, and Ca
marena, one of California's all-time
best prep throwers and a tneinbei of
two I .S. junior national teams. I he
( ardin.il also sends sophomore Malin
di Fltnore and senior Ashle\ Coupei in
the 1,500, seniot Anne Cunnison in
the 10,000 meters, senior Maureen
Onyeagbako 111 liammei and senioi
Julie I inker in the heptathlon.
I he C.arclinal women have never
won a national title. I his season is not
expec ted to provide the exception to
that rule, but it does mark the largest
number of women Stanford has ever
sent to the national championship.

I his year, Camarena, Donaghue and
Onyeagbako 111 tlu- field, along with
I inkei in the heptathlon, bring depth
to the (Cardinal attack.
Stanford is in good position to have
its best showing in the 1,500 meters,
where Clvnn's season-best is just one
second behind the time ol top-seed
Mary Jane llarrelson ol Appalacham
State going into the meet. (>lynn ran I
minutes, 10.98 seconds, to edge 112 lesh
man lor the I'ac-IO crown and get an
automatic qualifier nod, but holds a (a
reer-best 1:12.50. set in 1000.
Couper, tlu* third-place finisher at
the l'ac-10 meet, is seeded fourth
(i: 18.57), but has steadily improved
throughout the season after departing
from the hall-mile.
Stanford v\ ill likelv garnet big points
in the metric mile if all three Cardinal
harriers advance out ol their semifinal
heats on I hursciay. Saturday's final w ill
likeh be a showdown between llarrel
son, Clynn and North Carolina fresh

Fleshman out ol tlie top spot. Fleslnnart
had run a blistering 15:49.84 — then
the lastest collegiate time in the nation
— at the Ml San Antonio College Re
