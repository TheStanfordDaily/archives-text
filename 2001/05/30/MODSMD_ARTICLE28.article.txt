U inre baseball lime is only measured in
outs, all you have to do is su< eeed utter-
keep hitting, keep the i ally alive, and
you have defeated time. You remain fbr
ever young."
— Roger Angcll (by wa\ ol Kv Meagher)
I write this eolumn every year. I've held oil so lar
in this volume because the timing never seemed right

— the vagaries of whiflleball or slam
dunks or iee hot kev grabbed my at
tention, lot I am easily distracted.
But the stars have aligned correctly
diis week, and it's time to deliver the
annual pro< laination.
(lather dose now, children, and
listen carefully. If you take only one
teaching, one scrap ol useful advice
from the endless stream of non-

sense tli.it I have set unto these pages, take tins:
(>o to Sunken Diamond.
Simple, isn't it? All the good commandments are.
It's why people constantly nag when you steal and
covet, 1 >iit you (.111 bear false witness or craft idols all
you like without hearing a peep.
This is one of the easy commandments. The Car
dinal baseball team hosts South Carolina in one of
eight N( .AA Super-Regional series this weekend, and
the winner heads to( )maha lor the (College World Sc
ries the following weekend. Win or lose, this is your
last chance to see baseball on campus this season. And
I promise you, whether or not you watch baseball,
you want to be .it this stadium Friday night.
Student underattendance at Sunken Diamond is
one of the great mysteries ol the univev se, like the ex

istence ol peanut Initio and pnpcorn-llavored jellv
beans. I'm one ol I lie highest ollenders, baseball is one
ol my great loves, and. yet, the lirst game I made it to
this season was last Friday's 1-3 scjneakei against
Marist. Fven in tin- playolls, almost .ill ol the students
you see in the stands are roommates, girlfriends 01
friends ol gii (friends and roommates.
I tend to think tli.il the length ol the season keeps
people .it home; there's a tendency to say. "< )h, I'll get
'em next weekend, when it's nicer / m\ laundry's
dean / F.xe< utive ()i dei' isn'i on television." Fven on
a given weekend, it's tough to take three ot lout hours
out ol the business ol the da\ Plenty ol people simply
assume .1 game is too long, too boring, too nun h ola
hassle lot not enough (tin. I 'best* aren't unreasonable
things to think — I've been there myself.
But, lor one weekend, it's time to set those objec
tions aside. If you do nothing else this weekend, find
time (or this advice:
(>0 to Sunken Diamond.
I lere's why:
I Ins is the playolls, and, frankly, if vou missed the
NCAA Regional series last weekend watching the
NBA or the NIM. or some such "competition," you
missed out. I he Cardinal played live games 111 three
days (are vou joking?): one on Friday, then double
headers both Friday and Saturday. I he 1 egionals are
double-elimination; after beating Marist Friday
night, the Card lost to I'evas Satinda\ morning,
forcing them to beat Marist again Satinda\ night,
then take two st 1 aiglit from the I.onghoi 11s 011 Sun
day — the lii st time a Stanfot d team has ever swept
a < 11 in liiiiu double!icadct like that
