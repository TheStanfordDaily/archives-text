# Time to take it all back
## Columnist says he's sorry to all those he has offended 
### 
I 'm sorn to s.in that toda\'s column will be m\
lin.il arti< le ol this volume. And while I've thor
oughh enjoyed ranting and raving about evei \ -
, thing in sports ili.it I find ludicrous, entei lain-

mgor annoying, it has come to im .it
tention that there are some readers
who have found my editorial com
ments to be somewhat oflensive and
tasteless. I would like to use this final
column to apologi/e to all ol those in
the spoils world who did not I ind m\
comments amusing.
I o begin, I would like to extend a
heartfelt apologN to all members
.ind lans of the National Hot ke\

league. I have repeatedly stated that professional
hockey is not a sport and iliat the onlv thing good
about the \ 111. is Anna Kournikova. As n tin ns out. I
was wrong to s.iv that hockey is not a sport. W hat I
should have s.nd was that hockey is a terrible sport
that onl\ an alcoholit with a ptu k fetish would evei
waste time watt hing (unless, of course, Kournikova
happens to be rinkside) I apologi/e lot am confusion
oi bittei ness this ina\ have caused.
Kt|uall\ tlesei ving ol an apology are aged and <le
( repit NBA plavei s w Ik tin I i in fan l\ stated would lu
ll le sole benefit iaricsol (lie reilitrodtu lion ol the /one
defense to the \ BA. A more ( orret I .statement would
have made mention <>l the fa( I that all plavers w ho be
lieve that defense is die thing that encompasses vour
bat k\ aid and keeps the t log from gel ling out w ill ben
efit from the zone. So (ilenn Robinson, Ant aw ri Jami
son and all otheis w ho pla\ defense as il there were a
designated shootei rule in ellect, please act ept im
apologN foi not pointing out this l.u t sooner.
And I suppose that, even though ii goes against
everything I stand for, I should request forgiveness
from the New \ oik \ ankees loi deritluig llieii I.in isli
spending habits. As this season is proving thus far, il
seems that I he annual spend-a-thon better known as
11 it A ankees' pavroll lias on In bought the seventh-best
record in baseball. I he Bronx Bombers uonn find
themselves looking up at the Minnesota I wins in the
\incrican League, despite the lad that Derek |etei
ind Bei nie Williams make more than the I wins' en
lire rosier. I guess money can't .ilnv.ins bin the most
talented team; wlin else would (iliuck Kuoblaut li still
liave a iosiei spot?
While I'm apologizing It) New York, I suppose it

would be appropriate to go ahead and apologize to all
o| the following (Mies, states and countries for com
ments made at one point 01 anothei dining the year:
Minnesota. (Canada, Hasteni Hurope, St. Houis, (ol
orado. New Jersex. Hlorida, Philadelphia and Pitts
burgh. I'm sure that eat h ol these lot at tons has its own
spec ifit i hai in th.it is t'litle.uing to the simple lolk th.it
11 well within its hoi tiers. Besides, what would sports be
without the likes ol the Minnesota North Stars, the
Oiiehet \on lit jues, the St. Louis ('animals t>l the NHL
01 the I .S.S.R. Olvmpit team? Ilimutn ... 1 wonder
wh\ it is that I haven't heart I much from at i\ ol those
teams latch
I he group ol loval rcatlei s from whom I mt)st ea
gerh would like to seek sincere lorgiveness is the le
ni.lie contingent. 1 have received word that many
women leel that this column has had a misogynistic
slant and that I portra\ women as being unknowl
edgeable lans with no real put pose in sports. I would
like to vehemently tlcm these allegations because 1
feel that women have made a tremendous impact in
sports antl'will tontinue to do so.
(.lound-l)! taking female athletes have dispelled
the myth that onl\ the good-looking women who are
willing to show oil tlieii hot lies ( an succeed in a male
dominated spoils world. A t]tiick run through ol
some ol the most recognizable figures in women's
sports makes this (act abundant 1\ clear: Brandi Chas
taiu (the shirtless wonder), Steffi (iraf (SI swimsuit
model), ( h\na (IMavboy rovergirl) antl Kournikova
(most (low nloatled athlete on the Internet). ()kay, so
maybe these were bad examples.
But the on-field performances ol women have
been truh i evolutional \ Female svncln onized sw itii
iiKi s have (ontinuoush pushed the envelope of ex
cellent ein 111.11 sport, and.in doing so, are keeping
alive the dreams ol mam potential male svnt h ionized
sw iminers, who are waiting lot the tla\ in which sot i
et\ no longei laughs at men in the sport. Female ten

let luiic.ilit\ 112 emale race cat th ivci s have shown us
tli.it women ( an indeed tlrive at speeds up to and in
i hiding r> iill >11 and avoid serious accidents.
I loi one .mi e\( ited to see just how fai leinale in

et\ continue to jutlge women athletes based solely on
ihen alhletit merit with no regard to appearance or
patroi list iÂ» stereotx ping, the sk\ is the limit for female

And before 1 am boinbat (letl with neo-leminist


Ryan Stewart
hate mail from C anadians and
tans nl old NBA players, 1 would
like to point out the fart that one
ol the greatest things about sports
is that it allows us a briel moment
to step outside of the world in
which hatred and intolerance
bring death and misery to mil
lions, and it allows us to enjoy life
in the light-hearted and non-seri
ous manner in which it is meant to
be lived. So, I leave mv loyal read
ers with ibis, mv deep thought ol
the year, and, to all of those still
planning to have me tarred and
leathered, I apologi/e.

liyan Stewart is actually veiy unapolo
gelit for his viewpoints, and lit' hopes
that everyotie who /locs not 112 ind Ins col
umn even mildly amusing develops a
sense of humor. He can be reached at
