### DANIEL URBAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Its a historic week for I layward
field, the hallowed track stadium
of Kugene, Ore., or Tracktown,
U.S.A.
I he home ol distance running
legend Steve Prefontaine saw
record performances at the presti
gious Prefontaine ( lassie this past
weekend.
II all goes well lor Stanford's
own distance running stars, histo
ry could again be made at the
house that Pre built with a repeat
Stanford victory .it the N(IAA
I rack and Field Championships,
held today through Saturday*
Last year, Stanford broke the
University ol Arkansas's eight-vear
NCAA title-winning streak with a
72-59 upset. This year's trip to the
NCAAs follows the Cardinal's lat
est astounding performance, iis
first Pacific 10 Conference title
since 1927.
Not settling down for an in
stant, Stanford has maximized its
potential thus far ibis season, pro
ducing victories at the Big Meet
and Pac-lOs. I lie 1 1 men whose
marks qualified for NCAYs this
weekend will have to put every
thing together and come up with
yet another round of stellar per
formances to defend their title.
"This is our last chance to make
everything click," senior Michael
Stember said.
Sunday's Classic witnessed one
of track and field's oldest records,
the fastest mile run by a high
schooler—Jim Ryun's 3 minutes,
:>;>.3 seconds — I.ill to the Virginia
high school senior Alan Webb.
Webb ran 3:53.43 en route to a
fifth-place finish, defeating Brvan
Ben \ lull, the N( '.A\ favorite in the
1,500 meters.
The same fate might await
Berryhill on tlie same track, but
this time at the hands of Stanford's
Stember, junior Cabe Jennings —
the 2000 NCAA champion in the

event — and ireshman phenom
Don Sage, the middle-distance
group that will take center stage in
the Cardinal's attempt to bring
home a second straight NCAA title.
Sage owns the (onrth-lastest col
legiate time in the nation at
3:39.99, and Jennings (3:41.18)
lollows immediately 111 filth. |en
miigs will also compete in the 800
meters, w here lie posts the nation's
third-best time of 1:40.83.
Stemher will also double in the
800 and 1,500 meters, events in
whit h he is currently ranked filth
(1:47.17) and eighth (3:41.90),
respectively.
Stember's career-best and
school-record time ol 1:4f>.20 at
last ye.ti s \( IAVs yielded a fourth
place finish that, combined with
Ins set ond-place finish behind Jen
nings in the 1.500 meters, helped
push the ( ardinal to victorv.
Joining Stanlord's middle-dis
tance powerhouse is an equally
lormidable group ol long-dis
tance runners.
junior Jonathon Riley and
Ireslunen Setli I lejny and (itant
Robison hold the sixth- (13:40.00),
seventh- (13:40.81) and ninth
(13:49.82) lastest times in the
.>,OOO inetei s, respectively
Also, Riley's 10,000-metei
time ol 28.33.71 is a mere one
second shv ol the nation's top
time in the event.
While Staniord lias no repre
sentatives in the sprints or I in idles,
the distance ( rew will receive help
Irom sophomores |ason (»01l in
the decathlon, Milton Little in the
long jump, Michael I'onikvar in
the hi n 11 jump, ()nier I nan in the

the javelin.
(.oil, whose decathlon score ol
7,428 places linn 13th in the na

injured shoulder.
Little grabbed the last (|ualilv

(>l 25 feet.7l I m< hes. Inan (190-
10) and Wassink (234-0) rank

Kith and lOili in the nation, re
spectively. I'onikvar, who won
I'ac-lOs id a tie-breaking juinp
oll with Oregon's |ason Boness,
stands tied lor third with seven
other athletes at 7-1 1 2.
Barely missing the NCAA
qualifying standards was junior
Jesse I Ik tin.is. the l\i< -10 cham
pion in the !U)00-meter steeple
chase, whose time ol 8:10.19 lell
one sc( ond short ol qnalilving lor
the national championships.

Also, sophomore Nick Weli
ho/kiy. who threw the hammei
201-5, missed the standard by
just over three Icet.
()l the 12 men who won the
NC.AAs last year, lonr — Jen
nings, Stember, Rilev and
Wassink — return lor the at
tempted repeat.
I hough this year's team ol 1 1
has one man less than last year's, the
progress and achievements ol the
2001 squad make it a dangerous

(ontender lor 11 it' national title.
"It's amazing how far we've
eome," Stember said alter the
team's Pae-10 win.
Stanford is not favored to win
the national title, but neither was it
last year. In lan, the Cardinal has
averaged a full 10 points better
than I rark and Field Magazine's
predit tion for the last lour veai s.
Whether Stanford will onee

Stanford victory .it the N(IAA
I rack and Field Championships,
held today through Saturday*
Last year, Stanford broke the
University ol Arkansas's eight-vear
NCAA title-winning streak with a
72-59 upset. This year's trip to the
NCAAs follows the Cardinal's lat
est astounding performance, iis
first Pacific 10 Conference title
since 1927.
Not settling down for an in
stant, Stanford has maximized its
potential thus far ibis season, pro
ducing victories at the Big Meet
and Pac-lOs. I lie 1 1 men whose
marks qualified for NCAYs this
weekend will have to put every
thing together and come up with
yet another round of stellar per
formances to defend their title.
"This is our last chance to make
everything click," senior Michael
Stember said.
Sunday's Classic witnessed one
of track and field's oldest records,
the fastest mile run by a high
schooler—Jim Ryun's 3 minutes,
:>;>.3 seconds — I.ill to the Virginia
high school senior Alan Webb.
Webb ran 3:53.43 en route to a
fifth-place finish, defeating Brvan
Ben \ lull, the N( '.A\ favorite in the
1,500 meters.
The same fate might await
Berryhill on tlie same track, but
this time at the hands of Stanford's
Stember, junior Cabe Jennings —
the 2000 NCAA champion in the

event — and ireshman phenom
Don Sage, the middle-distance
group that will take center stage in
the Cardinal's attempt to bring
home a second straight NCAA title.
Sage owns the (onrth-lastest col
legiate time in the nation at
3:39.99, and Jennings (3:41.18)

Stemher will also double in the
800 and 1,500 meters, events in
whit h he is currently ranked filth
(1:47.17) and eighth (3:41.90),
respectively.
Stember's career-best and
school-record time ol 1:4f>.20 at
last ye.ti s \( IAVs yielded a fourth
place finish that, combined with
Ins set ond-place finish behind Jen
nings in the 1.500 meters, helped
push the ( ardinal to victorv.
Joining Stanlord's middle-dis
tance powerhouse is an equally
lormidable group ol long-dis
tance runners.
junior Jonathon Riley and
Ireslunen Setli I lejny and (itant
Robison hold the sixth- (13:40.00),
seventh- (13:40.81) and ninth
(13:49.82) lastest times in the

Also, Riley's 10,000-metei
time ol 28.33.71 is a mere one
second shv ol the nation's top
time in the event.
While Staniord lias no repre

Barely missing the NCAA

one sc( ond short ol qnalilving lor

201-5, missed the standard by
just over three Icet.

NC.AAs last year, lonr — Jen

I hough this year's team ol 1 1

"It's amazing how far we've
