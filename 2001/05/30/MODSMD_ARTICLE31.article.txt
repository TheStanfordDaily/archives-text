(Al*) — A ( ell phone woke lot tner Stanford
gollci ( !asc\ Martin from a peatelul sleep yes
terda\ morning, an irritating star! to the day.
I hen fie realized the hour — 7:25 in Fugene,
< )re., ahont the time the I .S. Supreme Court
i ( leases its decisions.
W hen his home phone rang minutes later,
Martin was pat< lied through to l'( «A I ouKoin
missionet I nil Fint hem and heard two words
he wasn't expecting.
"You prevailed."
I he Supreme ( oni t voted 7-2 to allow Mar
tin to ride a ( art in l'( -A l our competition be
i anse of the fierce pain in his right leg, the re
sult of a i ire ulator\ disease that makes it virtu
all) impossible for liini to walk 18 holes.
"I feel relieved, and I'm grateful it's behind
me,' Martin said. " 1 here's no guarantee that
goll will be in my future forever, but 1 can al
ways look bat k and know I prevailed through
I Ins."
So ended a I/2-year saga that pitted Mai
lt n against the powerful l'( iA loin and its con
tention that walking is an integral part of golf at
its highest level.

But while a victory lor Martin figured to be a
big setback for the I'CiA four, and perhaps
other sports and their right to set the rules,
Fine-hem said the ruling could turn out to be a
victory for both sides.
I was pleased that the tour! concluded this
should be an extremely narrow ruling, a ruling
that also went so far as to suggest in rather
strong language that this could be the onlv
player in the world that it ever applies to,"
Fint hem saitl.
"We can assume we now have flexibility to
maintain oin rules as they relate to walking. I
leel hum h bettei than 1 thought 1 would il von
had told me a lew days ago we were going to
lose."
Mat tin has Klippel-1 renaunay-Weber Svn
dtonie, a disordct than ( auscs his veins to i up
line and lill the cavities around Ins tibia with
blood. I igei Woods, his former teammate at
Stanford, retailed limes when Martin didn't
even want to walk at t oss the room to the bath
room because the pain was so gieat.
Still, the ttint held last to its rule that top goll
(on i pet it ion requires a plavci to chase aft ei the

ball with two legs — even though Martin essen
tially was playing with only one.
I heir evident e was in the history books. Hen

had to wear slot kings to redut e the swelling but
managed to walk !>(> holes in the final round to
the win the I S. ()pen a vear latei.
Ken Venturi, who testified against Martin,
had to overt oinc severe heat exhaustion to win
the 1964 l ,S. Open. Jose Maria Olazabal
missed IS months because ol ;i severe loot ui
)in \ and learctl he would never walk again, but
lie recovered to win the Masters.
Mai tin saitl having .i < art at Ins disposal situ e
11MIK has prolonged Ins < areei.
"1 think I'm in less pain toda\ than I was .'i
I 2 \ ears ago when I w.is walking quite a bit," lie
said. "Mv leg hasn't improved to that I'm able
lo forgo the (.lit, but it's been a help that I
thought it would be."
Martin, who plavetl on the l'(>.\ lout last
yeai hut is now relegated to the minor-league
Bu\ torn lour, used to wonder how iiiik h
longer he would be allowed to pi.in with the
cai I.
