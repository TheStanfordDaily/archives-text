# a 						weekly look at science and techology at Stanford Innovation
## Computer science class generates world-class software ideas 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has been tlit* incubator lot
main leading technology companies m Sil
icon Valley. SUN Microsystems, Excite,
Yahoo! and Coogle, just to name a lew,
were born at the Farm. Some ol the same
creativity and energy seen in these Stan
lord-propagated companies can be Ibund
in Computer Science 191: "Senior Project,"
the culminating project ( lass lor computer
science majors.
CS 194 has been part ol the computer
science major since its inception and is of
fered every spring quarter and sometimes
in winter quarter. "The most special aspect
of CS 194, though, is its interlace between
Stanford and the real world." said Robert
Plummet, a computer science lecturer.
Plumnier, who has taught the course lor
the past live years, said that he believes CS
194 is the closest bridge between academia
and industry.
"Students do everything: design, imple
ment, debug, present. I lie) oversee their
projects from [beginning] to end lor a full
quarter," Plummer said.
Jonathan Elfrat, a freshman and
prospective computer science major, said,
"From what I know, it sounds |like| a ver\
enjoying and worthwhile c lass. Instead ol
being confined to a structure, you must ex
periment, just like in industry."
Previous Projects
Indeed, (IS 194 lias seen a plethora ol ex
periments through the years, l-ist spring,
Alysson Soo-Hoo, Marissa Piemen and
Yvonne Cbala/.eh, then seniors and com
puter science majors, built a "Form Builder."
"It was an application that people could
use to build tests, forms and surveys.'" I reinen
said. "(>ur original goal was to provide a tool
for teachers that would help them prepare
classes and even do automatic grading."
Another past project was the "I-Help
System," built in 1998 by Eric Alberts, |cd
Burgess and Marc Rayhner, then juniors
.md computer science majors. "We wanted
to create an online help system that would
help CS l()f>: "Programming Methodolo
gies and Abstractions" section leaders and
stall to communicate," Burgess said. "It was
actually used in CS 10(i\ last year."

1 lie help system
consisted of a (li.tt
list .ind e-mailing
resources, built
with a Java graphi
cal interface.
I he most popular
form ol project is un
doubtedly computer
games. Jan Chong,
Jonathan l.uey,
Ric hard Lin and Will
Cain, then seniors
and computer sci
ence majors, pro
grammed a two-plav
er starship shooter
game l.ist spring.
"We had to think
about many things:
person-person com
bat. graphics and col
lision detection,
which was the hard
est," ('.hong said. "We
improved the origi
nal game by allow ing
two people to play
over the network.'
But projects were
not limited to the
user level. For in
stance. Nicholas
Fang and lakeharu
Nomura, seniors and
computer science
majors two years ago.
built .1 Palm Pilot
communication de
vice.
"Instead ol iitens
ing on the consumer
level, we built some
thing to help pro
grammers," Fang
said. "()ur device al
lowed two Palm Pilots

to communicate with
each other using in Ira led waves."
Fang went on to explain why the idea
did not materialize into .1 marketing suc
cess. "Our design had a major Haw. Mosi
Palm Pilots open the transmission onl\
upon .111 incoming connection and dose
soon thereafter. ()ur system, however, was

(nnstantl\ listening to possible calls. I Ins
inc.ml rcal-t imc communit at ion I>iit a huge
energy expenditure."
The Success Story
Although most projects never reach in
dustry. .1 lew <|o â€” .md tliev become big.

Possibly the
greatest suc
cess story is
the case of
Bluelark.com.
Th e
company was
founded in
1999 by John
Lenner and
Ben Strong,
then seniors
and computer
science ma
jors. Their sta
ple product
was a fruit of
(IS 194: a pro
gram that al
lowed Palm
Pilots to
download and
view Web
pages. The
idea of wire
less Web was
an instant suc -
cess. and the
Mount a i n
View-based
romp an y
grew greatly.
In late
Dec e in be r
2000, Blue
lark was sold
to Hand
spring, a
maker of
portable coni
lii un ic at ing
devices, for
$22 million.
I landspring is
c u rre n 11 y
using the tech
nology in its
newest prod-

net, called "Ula/.er."
"Things like that make you really
proud." IMumnier said. "Indeed, the
biggest reason 1 like to teach this class is the
students' enthusiasm. I'hey put an im
mense amount olellbrt in to their projects."
Caroline Clabaugh, a sophomore and

computer science major, said she thought
that stories like tins wore the exception
rather than the rule.
"A project has to he 11 ni<|iic .tin! good
in order for successful marketing," she
said. "For instance, from mv own inter
ests, it I were in the ( lass 1 would make a
scrabble game or some sort of learning
tool. It is nothing new and probably
would not be a business success, but what
you learn w hen doing something on your
own is priceless."
Spring Faire
I'lie conclusion of the class is a Spring
Faire, where the students present their pro
jects. This year, 11 will be held on June 13
from 12:15 p.m. to ."* p.m. in Meyer Library.
"Many venture capitalists and represen
tatives from the industry come to watch
what Stanford seniors are coming up with,"
Plummer said.
Dr. Patrick Young, a lecturer in the
Computer Science Department who
taught CS 191 List quarter, said, "I re
member our fair had manv interesting
projects."
"We had .in alumni tracking Web site,
designed by seniors Craig Mestel and
Bernardo Vogel, that is now being used by
the (.<>imiiiiiin ati<>n Department."
"In one of mv years, somebody made a
program that converted code into a flow
chart and vice-versa," Plummer said. "It
was realK neat because ii gave a different
visual dimension to what programming
can be."
Andrew Watkins and lun Carton,
seniors and computer science majors,
are t.iking tlu- class right now. "We are
building an encrypted \1 P.'J player with
[files stored on .i| servei." Watkins said.
"We are using an Oracle database to
back-feed the server ... I am liking the
class and am excited about the final
presentation."
"Anothei memorable project was a Web
site that replaces su.market, designed by se
niors Kthel Chen, Ross Davison, Frederick
I long, I )aniclSuand JelfWang," Young said.
The winner of the best project prize
last winter quarter was a system to man
age .t collection of photographs, de
signed by seniors Krik Uzereau and
David Weinstein.
