I he stimuli
that rarely go

unignored in limes ol general inattention have con
sistently been linked to stimuli with emotional im
pact.
Researchers from Yale and NYU say they believe
they have located the part ol the brain responsible
lor assigning emotional significance to such stimuli.
It is c alled the amygdala.
In past experiments, the amygdala lias been ac
tive iti emotional responses and. because of its
physical location, has connections to important re
gions ol the brain that make it a likely candidate for
mediating emotional responses, lo prove their
theory, researchers used the additional blink ef
fect, the observation that there is a brief time peri
od between receiving a stimulus and recognizing its
significance.
The experiment instruc ted participants to watch
<i steady stream ol black words and indicate each
time they saw a green word. As expected, there was
a ">()() millisecond delay in perceiving the green word
from when it first flashed. This was most evident

wlien the word was neutral, like "laundr\" ot
"house." lot instance. When words that evoke .1
more emotional response, such as "cancel" or
"rape," were flashed as the m-< ond word, the alten
tional blink delay was greatlv rcdiu ed.
l hese findings were from pailieipants with normal

amygdala lunction.
In a separate group
whose participants
had lesions on their
amygdalas, the

words were in

exploration into
the theory proved
consistent with the
already existing
knowledge of the

brain's function.
Linguistic events are processed in the left hemi
sphere of the brain, and participants with lesions
on the left half ol the amygdala had smaller differ
ences for attentional blink delay times between
emotional and non-emotional iespouses than those
with lesions on the i side. I lie implication tli.it
