All article in the Ma\ 17 issue of Nature expands
on the notion thai the emotional significance of cer
tain events causes a heightened perception of exter-

nal stimuli in
people. It had
been previ
ously deter
mined that
humans ini
tiallv take in all
stimuli on
equal terms ,

cessing. ig

and give more
attention to
others.
I he stimuli
that rarely go

unignored in limes ol general inattention have con
sistently been linked to stimuli with emotional im
pact.
Researchers from Yale and NYU say they believe
they have located the part ol the brain responsible
lor assigning emotional significance to such stimuli.
It is c alled the amygdala.
In past experiments, the amygdala lias been ac
tive iti emotional responses and. because of its
physical location, has connections to important re
gions ol the brain that make it a likely candidate for
mediating emotional responses, lo prove their
theory, researchers used the additional blink ef
fect, the observation that there is a brief time peri
od between receiving a stimulus and recognizing its
significance.
The experiment instruc ted participants to watch
<i steady stream ol black words and indicate each
time they saw a green word. As expected, there was
a ">()() millisecond delay in perceiving the green word
from when it first flashed. This was most evident

wlien the word was neutral, like "laundr\" ot
"house." lot instance. When words that evoke .1
more emotional response, such as "cancel" or
"rape," were flashed as the m-< ond word, the alten
tional blink delay was greatlv rcdiu ed.
l hese findings were from pailieipants with normal

amygdala lunction.
In a separate group
whose participants
had lesions on their
amygdalas, the
same test w.is per
formed .mil the dif
ferences ol attcn
tional blink delay
lor emotional and
non-emotional
words were in
significant. Further
exploration into
the theory proved
consistent with the
already existing
knowledge of the

brain's function.
Linguistic events are processed in the left hemi
sphere of the brain, and participants with lesions
on the left half ol the amygdala had smaller differ
ences for attentional blink delay times between
emotional and non-emotional iespouses than those
with lesions on the i side. I lie implication tli.it
humans are highly sensitive to occurrences ol emo
tional signilic ance is justifiable bee ause emotion.ill\
significant events receive more processing and end
up in our conscious thought more often than neu
tral stimuli.
I bis may lay the groundwork fora biological ex
planation of why events of emotional signilic ance are
more memorable. I he amygdala's role in memory
formation of emotional events has previously been
established and this new research begins to link the
neural mechanisms responsible lor perception and

memory formation.
A release from the National
Science Foundation details the
work of University of North Car
olina computer scientists who tot -
inucd work on a projec I started in
the inid-IOHOs that uses comput
er-aided design and manufactur
ing to produce !Â»l) uoi Ids contain
ing structures that engineers and
architects are wot kini; on.
I'he goal lias been to produce a
virtual "walk-through" as at < urate
as possible so that potential design

levels of complexity that allow a 111
million-element elc< trie power sta
tion to be navigated in real time.
Until now, sin h < oniplex designs
ran slowly and were jerky. I lie vi
sual (|ualitv of these renderings is
not as advanced as some of the I lol
lywoocl prodiu lions that have been
done, but the (ethnical detail is far
superior to that in movies. Hie ben
efits of such systems have made
global collaboration on projects
much simpler; meetings are now
held over speaker phone with a vir
tual walk-through, easing the clifli
culty of collaboration.
Initially, these programs were
intended for advanced Silicon
Graphics workstations but now
c an Ik- run on high-end l'( Is. This
continued work has made the
tec hnology more accessible for ex
