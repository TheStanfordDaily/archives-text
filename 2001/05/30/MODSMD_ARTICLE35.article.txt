Manx Stanford students pride
themselves on their indepen
dence .uid self-sulliciency. While
this is certainly a valuable and ad
mirable quality, equally essential

to our well
being and self
respect is our
ability to know
when to ask for
help. Converse
ly, it is impor
tant to know
how to give
help: how to
recognize those
in need and re
spond accord
ingly. Develop
ing such skills
can increase our
own happiness,
as well as build

<md reinforce our interpersonal
relationships.
Why is it so difficult
to ask for help?
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, direc -
tor ol Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services at Cowell Student
Health Center, said he believes
tli.it we all draw a division, of
varying strength, between our
personal and public selves. This
division allows us to hide our vul
nerabilities, maintain our sense of
sell and feel sale- and protected.
Crossing this line — making our
private lives public by opening up
to a friend or counselor, no mat
ter how trusted — c an be friglit

cning for several reasons.
first, we are surrounded at
Stanford by remarkably compe
tent people. It is natural to want
to demonstrate our own compe
tency, which includes not only the
ability to distinguish ourselves in

our academic pursuits, but to be
confident, resourceful and au
tonomous. Surrounded by "per
fection," we hesitate to admit to
our vulnerabilities and often pre
fer to deal with our problems
alone or ignore them altogether.
One student described this
characteristic metaphorically.
"Harvard and Yale students are
beavers. Stanford students are
ducks. You always see the beavers
running around and working
hard, but the ducks appear to be
calm and serene. Yet, when you
look under the water, they are
paddling like mad."
Another student made a simi
lar comment. "Stanford students
don't discuss their problems as

111 nt h, probably because they
ihink .ill the other Stanford stu
dents don't have problems," she
said. "So this perpetuates the
whole perfect- student myth.
Also, I think people may feel
ih.it, because thev are relatively

fortunate
in that
they do
go to
Stanford,
th e y
think
that any
problems
they have
are nt 't
wort h
mention
ing and
that they
don ' t
have any
right to

complain."
A second reason why we may
he afraid t<> ask for help and
thereby reveal our private lives,
according to Martinez., is that we
arc unsure whether talking
through a problem will really
help, particularly when we cannot
imagine am good solutions.
Finally, most of us were raised
with the value of keeping person
al matters that concern our (ami
lies and friends — two major
sources ol pain and trouble, as
well .is jov — private. Sharing the
details ola personal situation th.it
involves others may feel like a be
trayal and may also raise the ques-

tic hi ol how the information will be used.
Kasing the difficulty
I here are some situations that we can.
and should, deal with ellectivelv on oiu
own. Sometimes, however, the stress and
sense ol isolation that often result from un
resolved a nxiet\ ( an ac ciinililate and make
ns less resilient.
"We may lincl ourselves crving lor no
apparent reason <>i spend more time 'es
caping' through video games, the Inter
net, drinking and so forth," Marline/
said. " 1 liese are all coping strategies that
often don't work very well. Suddenly,
small problems seem big, and we reac li a
point where we leel that we |iist can't han
dle .in) more."
I hcsc situations mei it outside help,
which could iik lude talking to a friend or
trained counscloi or finding a book to read
on the siibjc-c t.
I low. then, can we < oucjiier our fears ol
revealing oiu private selves and exposing
our vulnerabilities? Marline/, offered sonic
strategies.
First, tr\ not to see asking for help and
autonomy as mutually exclusive. "Com
petent v and independent e is based upon
v\ hat you < an do with the resources avail
able to you. not what you c an do alone,"
he said. "Most ol us retogni/e that being
open to learning works well in our acade
mic lives. Look at asking for help — talk
ing to a friend or counselor oi even read
ing helpful literature — as a form of
learning or research. Taking advantage
of all ol Stanford's support resources can
only enhance your competency and abili
ty to achieve."
Tai loc kspciser, a senior psychology

majoi w ho has been a I »i iclge peei <01111-
selor lor three years, said, "When you
have a problem to solve, be it academic,
.is 111 .1 paper topic , 01 personal, you
need to do some research and seek out
multiple pel spec tives. Asking lot help
and advice is simph a way to gain addi
tional perspectives so ih.it \ou are 111-
loimeel enough to address the issue
properly."
She also encourages people lo look at
mental health in the same wa\ that we do
physical health. When we are ill and are
having a hard time getting well, we go to a
doc tor loi help. Why, then, do we see men
tal health so differently? We might ii\ to
look at a counseling session—lorinal 01
informal — as a form of "check-up" 01
"physical : a responsible step that we can.
and should, take to ensure out overall
health and produc ti\ ity.

Helping Others
()ne ran reap numerous benefits — in
cluding clarity, security and a diminished
sense ol isolation — from asking lor help.
Likewise, there are many benefits of giv
ing help.
Giving and receiving help are both ex
cellent ways to deepen a friendship and
aclcl meaning and significance to our lives.
Most of us have received help at one time

or another. Helping others is a wav ol re
in rning t hat gill. 11 can also add to our own
sclf-conlidence.
Knowing I am able to support some
one- 111 a tough time makes me led better
about my own competency," Lockspeis
er said.
Like Loe kspeiser, Martinez said he
enjoys 11 is job as a therapist because he
lee-Is incredible honor and appreciation
when people are able to trust him and
share theii feelings. "You can see the
unicjucncss, potential and resiliency in
people and watch them move 011 to bet
ter places. I his deserves much respect
and is wh\ I find inv work so meaning
ful.' he said.
How, then, can we best help others?
Whole books have been written on the
topic, but there are a few important
strategies.
First, learn to be an active listener.
When someone comes to you with a
problem, find a c|uiel place to talk, away
from any distractions, (live them your
lull attention and reflect ibis in your
bocl\ language: Make eye contact, use
verbal and non-verbal cncouragers —
such as "okay" and "tnm-hmm" — ap
propriately, do not fidget. and ask for
c la 1 ili« ations w hen necessary. If possible,
do not e ut oil conversations early, but let
them end naturally.
Second, do not give advice. Vincent
IVAndrea, founder of the Bridge, writes in
Ins book, "Peer Counseling: Skills, Fthic s
and Perspectives." that the basic premise
underlying peer counseling is that "stu
dents are often capable of solving their
own problems of daily living il given a
chance," and, thus, the role ol the peer
counselor is to "assist other students to find
their own solutions."
I Ins is one of the hardest strategies to
learn because often we feel that we have
experienc ed a similar situation and waul
to share il as .111 expression of solidarity or
empathy. But there are two problems
with giving advice: First, and most impoi -

tantly, it redirects tin* conversation away
Irom the counselee's problem .intl toward
voursell. I his may make hi in or her feel
Irusti ated oi ignored. Second, everv indi
vidual's experience is unit|ue and must be
addressed accordingly (living advice
might prompt the tounselee t<> feel inferi
or or resentful.
I bird, lot us on leelings, not soln
tit»ns. What the t ounselee is struggling
with the most is his oi her feelings about
a problem. By clarifying and working to
resolve Ihe feelings first. his or her prob
lem will be put in perspective and made
easier to manage. ()nl\ after you have
discussed feelings fora considerable
amount of time should you try to gener
ate solutions.
According lt> D'Andrca, "often a coun
seling session involves little more than the
expression and clarification of leelings.
Problems don't always need to solved, and
peer counselors play a most important role
in treating a safe context lor the free ex
pression of emotions."
When, and onlv when, your friend is
ready to problem-solve, can you can as
sist him or her in brainstorming a vari
ety of solutions. What is a cra/v solution?
What is a conservative solution? How
does your friend feel about these op
tions? II he or she cannot come up with
any solutions, focus on what to do in the
short-term — the next hour, day or
week — to feel better.
I he best we can do for friends in
pain is t<» empower them to solve tlieii
own problems. Practice active listen
ing. not giving out advice or passing
judgment. And lot using tin leelings
first and helping them generate their
own solutions will not only help them
see their problem as more manage
able, it will also increase* their confi
dence about their own ability to help
t hcmsclves.

When, and onlv when, your friend is

What is a conservative solution? How
does your friend feel about these op

any solutions, focus on what to do in the
short-term — the next hour, day or

Manx Stanford students pride
themselves on their indepen

this is certainly a valuable and ad

to our well
being and self

ability to know
when to ask for
help. Converse

how to give
help: how to
recognize those
in need and re
spond accord
ingly. Develop
ing such skills
can increase our
own happiness,
as well as build

<md reinforce our interpersonal
relationships.
Why is it so difficult
to ask for help?
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, direc -
tor ol Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services at Cowell Student
Health Center, said he believes
tli.it we all draw a division, of
varying strength, between our
personal and public selves. This
division allows us to hide our vul
nerabilities, maintain our sense of
sell and feel sale- and protected.
Crossing this line — making our
private lives public by opening up
to a friend or counselor, no mat
ter how trusted — c an be friglit

cning for several reasons.
first, we are surrounded at
Stanford by remarkably compe
tent people. It is natural to want
to demonstrate our own compe
tency, which includes not only the
ability to distinguish ourselves in

our academic pursuits, but to be
confident, resourceful and au
tonomous. Surrounded by "per
fection," we hesitate to admit to
our vulnerabilities and often pre
fer to deal with our problems
alone or ignore them altogether.
One student described this
characteristic metaphorically.
"Harvard and Yale students are
beavers. Stanford students are
ducks. You always see the beavers
running around and working
hard, but the ducks appear to be
calm and serene. Yet, when you
look under the water, they are
paddling like mad."
Another student made a simi
lar comment. "Stanford students
don't discuss their problems as

111 nt h, probably because they
ihink .ill the other Stanford stu
dents don't have problems," she
said. "So this perpetuates the
whole perfect- student myth.
Also, I think people may feel
ih.it, because thev are relatively

fortunate
in that
they do
go to
Stanford,
th e y
think
that any
problems
they have
are nt 't
wort h
mention
ing and
that they
don ' t
have any
right to

complain."
A second reason why we may
he afraid t<> ask for help and
thereby reveal our private lives,
according to Martinez., is that we
arc unsure whether talking
through a problem will really
help, particularly when we cannot
imagine am good solutions.
Finally, most of us were raised
with the value of keeping person
al matters that concern our (ami
lies and friends — two major
sources ol pain and trouble, as
well .is jov — private. Sharing the
details ola personal situation th.it
involves others may feel like a be
trayal and may also raise the ques-

tic hi ol how the information will be used.

our vulnerabilities? Marline/, offered sonic
strategies.
First, tr\ not to see asking for help and
autonomy as mutually exclusive. "Com
petent v and independent e is based upon
v\ hat you < an do with the resources avail
able to you. not what you c an do alone,"
he said. "Most ol us retogni/e that being
open to learning works well in our acade

ing to a friend or counselor oi even read
ing helpful literature — as a form of
learning or research. Taking advantage
of all ol Stanford's support resources can
only enhance your competency and abili

Tai loc kspciser, a senior psychology

She also encourages people lo look at

Helping Others
()ne ran reap numerous benefits — in
cluding clarity, security and a diminished
sense ol isolation — from asking lor help.
Likewise, there are many benefits of giv
ing help.
Giving and receiving help are both ex
cellent ways to deepen a friendship and
aclcl meaning and significance to our lives.
Most of us have received help at one time

or another. Helping others is a wav ol re
in rning t hat gill. 11 can also add to our own
sclf-conlidence.
Knowing I am able to support some
one- 111 a tough time makes me led better
about my own competency," Lockspeis
er said.
Like Loe kspeiser, Martinez said he
enjoys 11 is job as a therapist because he
lee-Is incredible honor and appreciation
when people are able to trust him and
share theii feelings. "You can see the
unicjucncss, potential and resiliency in
people and watch them move 011 to bet
ter places. I his deserves much respect
and is wh\ I find inv work so meaning
ful.' he said.
How, then, can we best help others?
Whole books have been written on the
topic, but there are a few important
strategies.
First, learn to be an active listener.
When someone comes to you with a
problem, find a c|uiel place to talk, away
from any distractions, (live them your
lull attention and reflect ibis in your
bocl\ language: Make eye contact, use
verbal and non-verbal cncouragers —
such as "okay" and "tnm-hmm" — ap
propriately, do not fidget. and ask for
c la 1 ili« ations w hen necessary. If possible,
do not e ut oil conversations early, but let
them end naturally.
Second, do not give advice. Vincent
IVAndrea, founder of the Bridge, writes in
Ins book, "Peer Counseling: Skills, Fthic s
and Perspectives." that the basic premise
underlying peer counseling is that "stu
dents are often capable of solving their
own problems of daily living il given a
chance," and, thus, the role ol the peer
counselor is to "assist other students to find
their own solutions."
I Ins is one of the hardest strategies to
learn because often we feel that we have
experienc ed a similar situation and waul
to share il as .111 expression of solidarity or
empathy. But there are two problems
with giving advice: First, and most impoi -

tantly, it redirects tin* conversation away
Irom the counselee's problem .intl toward
voursell. I his may make hi in or her feel
Irusti ated oi ignored. Second, everv indi
vidual's experience is unit|ue and must be
addressed accordingly (living advice
might prompt the tounselee t<> feel inferi
or or resentful.
I bird, lot us on leelings, not soln
tit»ns. What the t ounselee is struggling
with the most is his oi her feelings about
a problem. By clarifying and working to

Manx Stanford students pride
themselves on their indepen
dence .uid self-sulliciency. While
this is certainly a valuable and ad
mirable quality, equally essential

to our well
being and self
respect is our
ability to know
when to ask for
help. Converse
ly, it is impor
tant to know
how to give
help: how to
recognize those
in need and re
spond accord
ingly. Develop
ing such skills
can increase our
own happiness,
as well as build

<md reinforce our interpersonal
relationships.
Why is it so difficult
to ask for help?
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, direc -
tor ol Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services at Cowell Student
Health Center, said he believes
tli.it we all draw a division, of
varying strength, between our
personal and public selves. This
division allows us to hide our vul
nerabilities, maintain our sense of
sell and feel sale- and protected.
Crossing this line — making our
private lives public by opening up
to a friend or counselor, no mat
ter how trusted — c an be friglit

cning for several reasons.
first, we are surrounded at
Stanford by remarkably compe
tent people. It is natural to want
to demonstrate our own compe
tency, which includes not only the
ability to distinguish ourselves in

our academic pursuits, but to be
confident, resourceful and au
tonomous. Surrounded by "per
fection," we hesitate to admit to
our vulnerabilities and often pre
fer to deal with our problems
alone or ignore them altogether.
One student described this
characteristic metaphorically.
"Harvard and Yale students are
beavers. Stanford students are
ducks. You always see the beavers
running around and working
hard, but the ducks appear to be
calm and serene. Yet, when you
look under the water, they are
paddling like mad."
Another student made a simi
lar comment. "Stanford students
don't discuss their problems as

111 nt h, probably because they
ihink .ill the other Stanford stu
dents don't have problems," she
said. "So this perpetuates the
whole perfect- student myth.
Also, I think people may feel
ih.it, because thev are relatively

fortunate
in that
they do
go to
Stanford,
th e y
think
that any
problems
they have
are nt 't
wort h
mention
ing and
that they
don ' t
have any
right to

complain."
A second reason why we may
he afraid t<> ask for help and
thereby reveal our private lives,
according to Martinez., is that we
arc unsure whether talking
through a problem will really
help, particularly when we cannot
imagine am good solutions.
Finally, most of us were raised
with the value of keeping person
al matters that concern our (ami
lies and friends — two major
sources ol pain and trouble, as
well .is jov — private. Sharing the
details ola personal situation th.it
involves others may feel like a be
trayal and may also raise the ques-

tic hi ol how the information will be used.
Kasing the difficulty
I here are some situations that we can.
and should, deal with ellectivelv on oiu
own. Sometimes, however, the stress and
sense ol isolation that often result from un
resolved a nxiet\ ( an ac ciinililate and make
ns less resilient.
"We may lincl ourselves crving lor no
apparent reason <>i spend more time 'es
caping' through video games, the Inter
net, drinking and so forth," Marline/
said. " 1 liese are all coping strategies that
often don't work very well. Suddenly,
small problems seem big, and we reac li a
point where we leel that we |iist can't han
dle .in) more."
I hcsc situations mei it outside help,
which could iik lude talking to a friend or
trained counscloi or finding a book to read
on the siibjc-c t.
I low. then, can we < oucjiier our fears ol
revealing oiu private selves and exposing
our vulnerabilities? Marline/, offered sonic
strategies.
First, tr\ not to see asking for help and
autonomy as mutually exclusive. "Com
petent v and independent e is based upon
v\ hat you < an do with the resources avail
able to you. not what you c an do alone,"
he said. "Most ol us retogni/e that being
open to learning works well in our acade
mic lives. Look at asking for help — talk
ing to a friend or counselor oi even read
ing helpful literature — as a form of
learning or research. Taking advantage
of all ol Stanford's support resources can
only enhance your competency and abili
ty to achieve."
Tai loc kspciser, a senior psychology

majoi w ho has been a I »i iclge peei <01111-
selor lor three years, said, "When you
have a problem to solve, be it academic,
.is 111 .1 paper topic , 01 personal, you
need to do some research and seek out
multiple pel spec tives. Asking lot help
and advice is simph a way to gain addi
tional perspectives so ih.it \ou are 111-
loimeel enough to address the issue
properly."
She also encourages people lo look at
mental health in the same wa\ that we do
physical health. When we are ill and are
having a hard time getting well, we go to a
doc tor loi help. Why, then, do we see men
tal health so differently? We might ii\ to
look at a counseling session—lorinal 01
informal — as a form of "check-up" 01
"physical : a responsible step that we can.
and should, take to ensure out overall
health and produc ti\ ity.
l inalh , it is impoi tant to recognize the
numerous precautious counseling
providers, including both ('AI'S and the
Bridge, take to ensure confidentiality.
I he Bridge is completed anonymous,
and counselors do not keep anv wiitten
records of a session other than its date and
lime. At ('.APS, brief information from
your sessions is recorded, but the lile is
kept separate and independent from
your medical record and can onl\ be ac
cessed bv ('.APS stall, luloimation about
you. including your use ol the service,
cannot be released to anyone outside of
('.APS without your written permission.

dentiality, call 723-3785.
Helping Others
()ne ran reap numerous benefits — in
cluding clarity, security and a diminished
sense ol isolation — from asking lor help.
Likewise, there are many benefits of giv
ing help.
Giving and receiving help are both ex
cellent ways to deepen a friendship and
aclcl meaning and significance to our lives.
Most of us have received help at one time

or another. Helping others is a wav ol re
in rning t hat gill. 11 can also add to our own
sclf-conlidence.
Knowing I am able to support some
one- 111 a tough time makes me led better
about my own competency," Lockspeis
er said.
Like Loe kspeiser, Martinez said he
enjoys 11 is job as a therapist because he
lee-Is incredible honor and appreciation
when people are able to trust him and
share theii feelings. "You can see the
unicjucncss, potential and resiliency in
people and watch them move 011 to bet
ter places. I his deserves much respect
and is wh\ I find inv work so meaning
ful.' he said.
How, then, can we best help others?
Whole books have been written on the
topic, but there are a few important
strategies.
First, learn to be an active listener.
When someone comes to you with a
problem, find a c|uiel place to talk, away
from any distractions, (live them your
lull attention and reflect ibis in your
bocl\ language: Make eye contact, use
verbal and non-verbal cncouragers —
such as "okay" and "tnm-hmm" — ap
propriately, do not fidget. and ask for
c la 1 ili« ations w hen necessary. If possible,
do not e ut oil conversations early, but let
them end naturally.
Second, do not give advice. Vincent
IVAndrea, founder of the Bridge, writes in
