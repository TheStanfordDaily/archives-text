Manx Stanford students pride
themselves on their indepen
dence .uid self-sulliciency. While
this is certainly a valuable and ad
mirable quality, equally essential

to our well
being and self
respect is our
ability to know
when to ask for
help. Converse
ly, it is impor
tant to know
how to give
help: how to
recognize those
in need and re
spond accord
ingly. Develop
ing such skills
can increase our
own happiness,
as well as build

<md reinforce our interpersonal
relationships.
Why is it so difficult
to ask for help?
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, direc -
tor ol Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services at Cowell Student
Health Center, said he believes
tli.it we all draw a division, of
varying strength, between our
personal and public selves. This
division allows us to hide our vul
nerabilities, maintain our sense of
sell and feel sale- and protected.
Crossing this line — making our
private lives public by opening up
to a friend or counselor, no mat
ter how trusted — c an be friglit

cning for several reasons.
first, we are surrounded at
Stanford by remarkably compe
tent people. It is natural to want
to demonstrate our own compe
tency, which includes not only the
ability to distinguish ourselves in

our academic pursuits, but to be
confident, resourceful and au
tonomous. Surrounded by "per
fection," we hesitate to admit to
our vulnerabilities and often pre
fer to deal with our problems
alone or ignore them altogether.
One student described this
characteristic metaphorically.
"Harvard and Yale students are
beavers. Stanford students are
ducks. You always see the beavers
running around and working
hard, but the ducks appear to be
calm and serene. Yet, when you
look under the water, they are
paddling like mad."
Another student made a simi
lar comment. "Stanford students
don't discuss their problems as

111 nt h, probably because they
ihink .ill the other Stanford stu
dents don't have problems," she
said. "So this perpetuates the
whole perfect- student myth.
Also, I think people may feel
ih.it, because thev are relatively

fortunate
in that
they do
go to
Stanford,
th e y
think
that any
problems
they have
are nt 't
wort h
mention
ing and
that they
don ' t
have any
right to

complain."
A second reason why we may
he afraid t<> ask for help and
thereby reveal our private lives,
according to Martinez., is that we
arc unsure whether talking
through a problem will really
help, particularly when we cannot
imagine am good solutions.
Finally, most of us were raised
with the value of keeping person
al matters that concern our (ami
lies and friends — two major
sources ol pain and trouble, as
well .is jov — private. Sharing the
details ola personal situation th.it
involves others may feel like a be
trayal and may also raise the ques-
