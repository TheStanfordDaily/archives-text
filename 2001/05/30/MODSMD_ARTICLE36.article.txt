here's a basie prim iple in playing pool:

fers energy to the object ball and creates
paths foi both balls m a prcdw table mannei.
(for simplicity's sake, we will assume no
spin and a straight-on hit).
Mere's an example: In Figure A, you will
see both the cue ball and object ball in posi
tion 1. I lie objet 1 ball is direi Ily in front o!
the pocket. I he question is where to hit the

object ball with the cue
ball so that you'll sink
the object ball I Ins
can be determined
with a bit ol vector
math. Ihe <ue ball is
hit and travels with a
certain velo< itv (t'). II
it does not hit the ob
ject ball, it would con
tinue along its path
with that velot itv (v).
However, as the
cue ball hits the ob
ject ball (illustrated
in position 2), its ve
lo< iiv is split between
its "vertical" and
"horizontal" compo

tion 1. I lie objet 1 ball is direi Ily in front o!
the pocket. I he question is where to hit the

object ball with the cue
ball so that you'll sink
the object ball I Ins
can be determined
with a bit ol vector
math. Ihe <ue ball is
hit and travels with a
certain velo< itv (t'). II
it does not hit the ob
ject ball, it would con
tinue along its path
with that velot itv (v).
However, as the
cue ball hits the ob
ject ball (illustrated
in position 2), its ve
lo< iiv is split between
its "vertical" and
"horizontal" compo
nents. 1 hese compo
nents, as a rule, must
be perpendx ulai to
ca< li ot her. To clari
ly, remember vmn

right iikiiih'lcv Well, think oi the path

Iraveled with vchx itv v .is
ilu- hypotenuse and the
( oniponents as ol I lie
Iriangle. I hus, t lie «ue
I).ill moves hori/ont al l\
with hoi i/ontal velocity t\
.iikl the ol)je< I hall moves
vet tm ally with verti< al ve
lo( 11 \ i). ('.onvenienth . the
ohjec t hall's vei tit al p.it li
is exactly in line with the
po< ket, so it goes right in.
I lie moral ol the
stoi \is th.it this <11\ ision be
tween vertical and hoi i/on
tal « oniponents alw a\ s hap
pens. so \ou can gauge the
pat lis ol the ( ue and object
halls using theii perpendu -
ul.ll i elationship. I sing this
knowledge — and with
some practice — you'll he
able to send I lie < ue ball on
a path sim b that its < onta< t
w itli the object ball leads the
obje< t ball i ight to a pocket.
Kut, il you want to
impi ess hini. lici e's a cool
link It's deliniteh a setup,

meaning thai nII iit*\t-i happen (lining a
regular game, but he'll like this one. What
you do is ,ii range live 01 six object balls in a
seniit in le, with the last one at an angle to the
po< ket (Figuie B). All you have to do is allow
the ( lie ball to hit the first object b.ill, and the
last object h.ill will head toward the pocket.
Whv docs this work.-' Well, the vector com
ponents ( ome into pla\ again, as thev always
do: When the cue l>,ill hits the lit st object
ball, its "diagonal" path is split up into its
vertical .11 id horizontal components.
\\ bile the In si objec 1 ball would have gone
on path Ail it had not been touching the sec -
ond objec 1 ball, it travels on path B (the vei ti
< .11 component) and "hits" the second object
I).ill with the 1101 izontal component (path (1).
I lie a second object ball, which would have
continued on ibis path (('.) il it were not
tone hing object ball three, actualK travels on
path I) and hits object ball loin with its hoi 1-
zontal component. And so on, until the List
object ball. I Ins object ball doesn't hit any
other I». 111 s. so 11 follows us "undivided" path,
1 ight into t he pocket.
Let me know how the elate uocs!
