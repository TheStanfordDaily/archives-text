Many ol Hennessy's colleagues
noted Ins penchant for honest\
and sincerity.
"John is one of the most intelli
gent. straight-shooting people I
know," said Provost |ohn
Ktchemendy. "He's always a step
ahead. I his has been a verv 'big'
year with a lot of big issues, and |olin
has handled tlietn all very well."
Vice I'rovost lor Student Allan s
Jim Montoya, who will be leaving
his post in June after 10 years at
Stanford, said he agreed.
"Working with |ohn li.is been .1
pure pleasure," Montoya said. "I le

issues. Ins overall concern lor stu

senior administrators."
A native ol New York, I len
nessy joined Stanford 111 the I.ill ol
1977 as an assistant professor ol
electric al engineering, rising to as
sociate professor in lON'i and full
professor in l')H(i. In 199(i, C.asper
appointed llenness\ dean ol the
School ol Kngineei ing.

in 1909, following the depar
ture ol (loudolee/./a Rice, llen
ness\ became Stanford's provost.
Hennessx said he agreed that
being .it 11ic helm of an institution
as large and diverse .is Stanford
encompasses responsibilities dif
ferent from the ones he had as
dean and, l.itei. as provost.
"Kisii all\. the buck stops here,"
lie said. "You just need to make the
piopei adjustments while attend
ing to .1 whole new set of issues.
Ihe president is sometimes the
target loi .1 lot <>l things, and you
have to learn to get comfortable
with that."
I his year, I lenncssy has also
had to deal with some turnover in
the administration.
Sharon Long, Professor of Bio
logical Sciences, was named Dean
of the I lumanities and Si iences 011
April (> ol tliis vear. She explained
that the recent turnover in many
administrative positions w.is ex
pected. .is pari of the ( hanging of
presidents, .uul began prior to
llenness\ taking office, while he
was provost.
"Thus, President llennessy's
has been able to look foi .i set of
partners with whom he can move
the univei sii\ forward," Long said.
"I am honored, and quite excited,
to be named the new Dean of I lu
manities and S< iences."
"I deeply appreciate the em
phasis that President Hennessy
has placed on the School ol 1111-

we have ;i ver\ exciting era ahead

ing to .1 whole new set of issues.
Ihe president is sometimes the
target loi .1 lot <>l things, and you
have to learn to get comfortable
with that."
