Professor Eleanor E. Maccoby is one of the world's
foremost developmental psychologists. She received
her Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, taught for eight
years at Harvard, and joined the Stanford psychology department in
1958.
Professor Maccoby has devoted much of her career to the study of
social development. In addition to her well-known text on this topic,
she has published several authoritative books on the nature and ori
gins of gender differences, as well as three volumes on divorce and
custody.
Professor Maccoby has won virtually every honor available to a psy

Research in Child Development. She has been elected to the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Institute

Her talk at Bing will consider the question "How much

on children, in the context of genetics and
non-parental influences. This topic has been prominent in the news
since the publication, three years ago, of a book by a New Jersey
psychologist claiming that parents have only a minimal influence on
their children's development.
