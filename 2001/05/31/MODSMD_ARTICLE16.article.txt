rently in the studio recording a follow-up to its

"The show was very successful from both the
perspective of Common's performance and as
an end-of-the-year closure for S(IN," said senior
Wes Radez, director of the concert network.
"We have tried to bring a lot of different types of
music to campus this year."
The show began with a 50-minute set bv

mon. I le pleased the crowd midway through the
set with an improvised freestyle about Stanford,
highlighted b\ references to former Stanford
basketball star Mark Madsen and to Brainier
Mali, lie was aided in his freestyle bv junior
Damon Jones.
"The freest vie was great," Rade/ said. " The
( rowd stayed with ('.ointnon the entire time. The
crowd was awesome."
"He was frcestvling for awhile. It was really
cool," senior Laura Jean Torgerson said. "T hat
got people reallv excited, seeing people they
know."
"Common was really dope,"
junioi Ben (loatcs said. "Ik* had
rcalh good stage prest*net* and
interacted with the audience
well. I thought he was a lot better
live than lie sounds on vinyl."
Some students were not as en
thusiastic about the at is.
"Personally, I thought Black
alicious was kind of wackali

cious," said Julian Allen, a senior
.it Bishop ()' I)owd high school in
Oakland. "Their (11) is better
than I heir live act."
Rade/ said 11ic show was illus
traiive of the concert network's
success hi putting together enter
taining events throughout the
year. Previous events sponsored
b\ the concert network this year
include sold-out shows by Dis
patch. Dai Williams and Politic;il
ly Incorrect with Bill Maher. I lie
concert network has sold out lour
out of live ticketed shows.

"The year has been punctuat
ed by a lot of highlights: The lead
singer oi Vertical Hori/on singing
'All Right Now'before Big(>ame,
Dispatch singing 'The General'
aiif 1 people dancing in the aisles <it
Dar Williams," Rade/ said.
"1 will also remember stu
dents packing the (loffee 1 louse
to see l'seudopod, and people
vibing to Common through (he
whole show."
The concert network attempts
to fulfill two goals when deciding
which artists to bring to campus,

according to Rade/.. He said
artists must be entertainers that
people want to see, and different
artists must appeal to dillerent
groups of si udents.
" The biggest challenge is trying
to keep on the pulse of what stu
dents want to hear," Rade/ said.
While no acts have been final
ized for next year, Rade/ said I In
comer! network will follow the
same formula next year.
"It's been a great year, and
students can expect more ol the
same in the future," Rade/ said.
