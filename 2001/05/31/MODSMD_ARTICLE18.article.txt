Till-. 1111 M 1( )P (X )N I'NDRI \1 lias
once again struck Stanford. Last
Sunda\ s coiu ert at Memorial Audi
torium with Common and Blackali
cions, two well-known hip-hop performers,
failed to sell out, leaving the Stanford (loncert
Network facing the cfiflic nit question <>l how to
bring hip-hop to Stanford in a financially vi
able way. We commend the concert network
for bi ingingadiverse group of talented ads to
campus, but would like to suggest some
< hanges for next year's events to ensure that
concerts are both musicalh enriching and fi
nancially sensible.
1 he demographics of the Stanford commu
nity do not alwa\ s la vor the success of even well
known lap l lists like Common. I lip-hop
iniisK is often linked not onl\ I< > race, I nil also to
(lass status, liecaiisc the Stanford conmiiinit\ is
not especialh facialis or socioeconomically di
verse, ii is not difficult to see why hip-hop does
not base a vei \ large fan base on campus.

Make no mistake: Not all people of color lis
ten to hip-hop. I lowever, most people at Stan
lord do not come from backgrounds thai
thrive on hip-hop music. I his is reflected in
the fact that lesser-known folk singer l)ar
Williams sold out at Stanford in less than an
hour, while only 1,100 of the 1,700 seats in
Memorial Auditorium sold over a three- week
period for Common. Cranted, Williams was
pla\ ing in the smaller kresge Auditorium, but
the enthusiasm surrounding her concert
seemed to suggest th.it her music reaches .1
larger portion of the Stanford population.
While other reasons for paltry tic ket sales ina\
be th.it students were traveling ovei the long
weekend and that Common had already
plaved at a number of venues in the area, they
do not account for the larger general trend this
weekend's concert highlighted.
In previous years, the concert network has
been criticized lor not bringing hip-hop music
to c ampus, but any reluctance to solicit such acts

is based on simple economics. Because there is
less demand lor hip-hop, the concert network
is less likely to invite such groups because doing
so may represent a financial blow.
But while such reluctance is understandable,
the concert network should not succumb. II
anything, this weekend's concert shows just
how necessary it is lor hip-hop to have a larger
presence at Stanford. I he fact that a huge
name like (loininon did not sell out borders on
shocking, especially considering that (lorninon
was the onl\ popular rap artist to come to Stan
lord this year. The Stanford community needs
to get excited about diverse forms of perfor
mance, and the concert network has the power
to create much ol that enthusiasm.
While the (loin moil concert did not sell out, it
was «» complete success for most of those who .it
tended. "riie concert brought together hip-hop
lovers ol .ill rates and classes, lor the audience, it
was an ama/ing night tli.it re-emphasi/ed how
ill< rediblv inipoi taut it is for more hip-hop acts

to lx' showcased on campus.
There are many ways to address the problem
of underattendance. ()ne solution is for the con
cert network to bring hip-hop acts to smaller
venues. ()f course, the idea is not to force some
one like Common to perform in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. Rather, it may be feasible to invite
more local hip-hop acts to perform on a more
frequent basis. The strategv would not only be
financially more prudent, but would also pro
vide fora more consistent presence of hip-hop
on campus. Hopefully, (his sustained presence
could help build a fan base.
While these suggestions are not exhaustive,
they are a start. I he concert network has had
one of its best years in recent memory and
should not be discouraged by the latest concert
turnout. ()rganizers for next year must locus 011
fine-tuning a strategy for bringing hip-hop to
campus, promoting community support for di
verse acts and building on the considerable mo
mentum «md success of this year.
