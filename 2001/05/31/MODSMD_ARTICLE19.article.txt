So, excuse me while I

have I learned from Stanford?
No. I — I lie world is avers random
place. P>\ ilns. I mean that ilie world is lull ol
random variables. People and situations
change vcr\ quickly; often things aren't
what the\ seem. You make even decision
nuclei inn ei t.iint\.
For instance, I'd never expected to lie at
Stanford. I his is not about tin not expell
ing to get in .ind then being delirious with
jo\ tb.it I did — the wa\ some ol vou liesh
inen si ill are. ((.el ovet it. please). I'd spent
tn\ high school years prepping lot entrv to
Oxlord. to read politics, plnlosopln and
economic s.
()ne humid August aliei noon. I bumped
tnto.t friend at the s< hool libt at \. She had an
extra copy ol Stanford's application. I filled
it out Ixcause I had nothinglxttei to do the
week Ix'lbre I was dialled into the Singa
porean armv. Mien I had to choose: Stan

lx*er. Who knows whi< li is better? I Hipped

left friends behind in Singapore. Others
went to Kngland. \t Stanford. I ( hanged
dorms even year, making new fi iends and
losing old ones. Some of inv most homo
phobic friends are now gav. Man-eating

No. — and I've realized this onlv re
(enth: Asian Ainei it ails are dillerent from
Asians. Asians don't drive rice i<h kcis. We
drive Mercedes Ben/cs with tinted win

advei tise vout povertv with Hashing under
carriage lights, unmullled engines and .1
lowered chassis. Real Asians believe that
pretentiousness is the exclusive province ol
the tilth suecesslttl. Otherwise, it's simph
bad taste.
Moreover, real Asians want to be Asian,
whereas Asian Americans have their own
distinctive scene, (k) to am dub 111 Singa

not hip-In >p. Real Asians, union 1 match, are
also suckers lor slow, sentimental, sugan
Cantonese pop ballads. (Think Britney,
without .1 c.Hc In beat. Yeah, it's godawful.)
I hese are apparenth not "badass" enough
lot the Asian Americans.
No. I—and this is a serious point:
Youth is the greatest asset. At the ripe old
age of 2.5, I'm beginning to leel less invinci
ble than Ix'lore. Opportunities that came
and went won't return. Choices are Ix-giti
tling to stick; they're no longer instantly re
versible. Y< >ii can sav, "Whoops, I'm sorry,"
but, afterward, you remain sorry. It's now
just an expression of regret, rather than
what it used to Ik- — a signal lot a fresh new
start without trace of the past.
Youth lorgcts. Adulthood anil the real
world remember. Perhaps, in order to
prepare us lot post-college lile, Stanford
did too little to strip us of out youth. Per
haps it gave us too many second chances
to build truly adult characters, but it was
fun while it lasted. To be young was exhil
arating. lo be young at Stanford, now
lli.it was heaven.

Much too soon, l\l Sluing will no longer lie a
cotenmn/d student in wlertuitmuil fmhcy stiuliss.
