Fraternities 'do a disservice' to Stanford
1 would like to lake issue with Bran
don ( hock's letter ("Golumn missed 'a
few kc-\ realities ili.it jllslll\ Greek" hous
ing") to the editot on I uesdav advocat
ing housing more fraternities on the
Row. Obtaining priority at La Gasa li.il
lan.i has nothing todowith "prctcncl[ing|
to speak Italian." but rather with provid
ing proof of Italian language study — a
Stanford transcript.
Also, 1 .mi not convinced that provid
ing "live crappy beer" is really a set vice to
the Stanford community. But even il it
were, mam Row houses already do this or
host parlies sponsored by un housed fra
ternities that do.
But, I argue that fraternities actually
do ,i <lissc'i vice to the Stanford communi
ty In further segregating it. Basing admis
sion to a Row house on an arbitrary Draw
number or ac ademic interest is one thing,
but basing it on belonging to a selective,
exclusive social organization is another.
Many ol these groups, especially the
housed ones, tend to have very while and
often wealthy members. F.thnic fraterni
ties exist, but these, of course, still segre
gate tlie community.
I do not think there is a simple solu
tion to the problems of housing under
graduates at .Stanford. But I'm sure that
housing more Greek organizations isn't
a part of any good solution. And I say
this even though I owe my very exis
tence to fraternities and sororities — my
patents met at a joint event between

their (ireek organizations.

Taliban's decision to brand Hindus
mirrors Nazis' persecution of Jews
VVe arc outraged to hear of the I al
iban's recent decision to tone lliiulus
who reside in Afghanistan to wear yellow
patches lor "identification purposes."
I his repressive and unjustifiable deci
sion is eerily reminiscent of Na/i policy
in the 1930s and 1940s th.it required
Jews to wear yellow Stars of David.
Given the obvious symbolic parallel be
tween the yellow Stars of David and the
yellow patches, we feel that the enact
ment of I Ins decision will be a gross vio
lation of human rights.
Ironically, the Taliban claims tli.it this
edict will protect Hindus from being
punished lot not adhering to Islamic law
— namely, by identifying those Hindus
who are caught by the police for not at
tending daily Islamic prayers as I lindus.
Human Rights Watch, however, points
out that identification cards that indicate
the bearer's religion already exist to pro
tect those who encounter the police. In
news reports, Afghan Hindus have de
scribed how they feel that this decision by
the I aliban will jeopardize their safely.
It stretches the imagination to think
that a regime that was responsible for the
destruction of centuries-old Buddhist slat

lies —an act ollensive to many, if not
most, Hindus — is planning to use the yel
low patches out of a genuine desire to pro
tect the Hindu minority. It seems rather
obvious that the actual ellects of the Tal
iban policy will Ik- to stigmatize the Hindu
minority, foster further religious intoler
ance and set the groundwork lor even
more serious human rights violations.
Ihe Taliban's decision is not just a
"Hindu issue," but a human rights issue
th.it should be of concern to the global
community. Indeed, the United Na
tions — as well as numerous governments,
human rights organizations and religious
organizations— have all voiced their ob
jection to the Taliban's decree. Moreover,
many Muslims have also publicly ex
pressed their dismay at the yellow patch
decision. VVe recognize that the Taliban's
ac tions are not characteristic or typical of
Islam as .1 whole, but are instead specific
acts committed by a specific regime.
We strongly urge the Stanford com
munity to get involved by expressing
concern about this issue to representa
tives in Congress and to President Bush.
