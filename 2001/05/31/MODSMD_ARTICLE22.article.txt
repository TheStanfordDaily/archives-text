SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif.
(AP) — Amid towering trees that are among
Earth's oldest and largest living things, Pres
ident George YV. Hush pledged yesterday to
protect "these works of God" and other nat
ural treasures from mankind.
Sequoias taller than the Statue of Liberty,
broader than a bus and older than the
Roman Empire served as a backdrop while
Bush sought to answer critics ol his environ
mental policies.
"Our duty is to use the land well, and
sometimes not to use it at all," the cowboy
boots-c lad president said at the close of a
three-day West Coast trip.
1 le announced a new directive calling lor
rangers to conduct annual reviews ol each
national park and renewed his move fora
five-year, $5 billion ellbrt to tut back the
parks' heavy maintenance backlogs.
In advance ol the trip, the administration
announced it would let stand a proposal ap
proved in the last days of the Clinton presi
dency to clean up hazy skies over national
parks and wilderness areas. It would require
older coal-lired utilities, among others, to be
retrofitted with new pollution-control tech
nology by 2013.
"Had (>hrist himself stood on this spot, he
would have been in the shade of this verv
tree," Hush said in a speech that touched on
the moral imperative to protect the Earth.
" There's much to admire and appreciate
in the works of man. But come here, and
you're reminded of a design th.it is not our
own," he said. "We find a grandeur beyond

our power to equal."
The president has been criticized lor his
support of logging in national forests and
drilling on public lands as well as his back
tracking from the Clinton administration
policy to reduce arsenic levels in water and
his broken campaign promise to regulate
carbon dioxide emissions.
The Sierra Club suggested that Bush was
in no position to claim the mantle of envi
ronmentalist.
"Our national monuments and other
public wild lands deserve full protection and
not exploitation for profit, said the club's
executive director, Carl Pope.
As Bush left the park fora visit to an ele
mentary school at nearby Dunlap, Calif., in
the Sierra Nevada foot hills, the presidential
motorcade passed about 30 protesters car
rying signs protesting Bush's environmen
tal policies. Among the signs where "No
drilling ANWR"— the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge — and "Protect what's left."
With polls showing voters skeptical of bis
commitment to the environment, advisers
say Bush plans a series of trips and events
that reflect deep concern for natural re
sources. He is scheduled to announce new
protections for the Kverglades during .»trip
to Florida on Monday and I uesday.
"We cannot see into the centuries ahead,
but we can be sure, in a place like this, that
we're iti the presence of enduring things.
And it will be to our lasting credit if these
works of' Cod are still standing a thousand
years from now," the president said.
