## Stanford needs to support fans Student supporters are a necessary part of a strong athletics program 
### 
This weekend, Stanford's
Sunken Diamond was
host to some of the most
exciting collegiate base
hall of the year.
I pset by third-seeded I ex.is m

the winner's
bracket game on
Saturday, Stan
ford needed to
knock off spunk)
underdog Marist
(from Pough
keepsie, N.Y, il
vou're curious) in
Saturday's night
cap and then take

two games from l ex.is on SundaN
to continue its march toward the
College World Scries in ()maha.
In a fantastic day <>l baseball,
the Card stored in the bottom <>l
the 10th to take the first game,
10-9, from the l.onghorns and
then scored three runs in the
eighth to come from behind and
win, 4-H, in the second game,
winning the regional.
I was in attendance loi all four
of the Saturday and Sunday
games, and ii was some of the most

exciting sports action I have seen
in a while. I he only problem was
that I was one of less than 50 Stan
ford students in attendance
among the nearly capacity crowd
at Sunken Diamond.
1 his column is an open letter to
the Stanford community, the De
partment of Athletics and Athletics
Directoi led Lelatid, asking lh.it
we make our athletic s facilities (not
just in baseball) more accessible
and encouraging to student sup
port of our athletes.
At Stanford, we have the
unique opportunit\ to witness an
unbelievably broad spectrum of
athletic success in some of the na
tion's best facilities. I lowever, be
cause of a number of Athletic s I )e
-partment decisions, we as students
are stilled in our abilities to utilize
these opportunities, and our ath
letes are robbed of the full support
of the student body that should be
commensurate with their endless
hours ol hard work.
Fan support, especially from
students, is an integral c omponent
in developing a legac \ of sporting
excellence. I rom basketball at
Duke and football at 1 exas A&M
to baseball at 1 .ouisianna Stale and
wrestling .it lowa, energetic , sup
portive (I'll even sav rowdv) stu

<lfiil < i (>wds are vital to the sut cess
of these programs.
In maii\ sports, the tiling that
holds Stanford back, from achiev
ing the same calibei tradition .is its
peel s is not the- performance of the
athletes on the field, hut the per
formatK e of tlu- fans in tlu- stands.
Never before have I seen a
s( hool that does less to encourage
students to be involved in < heel
ing foi tlieii athletic teams —
nevermind one that has won six
straight Sears I)iret toi s' ( aips.
Sure, we've got the- Sixth Man
( luf). and it's all well and good,
but that's about where it ends.
At football games this year, yell
leadei s were not permitted to run
tlu- flag all tlu- wa\ around the sta
dium track after we scored a
touchdown because the facilities
supervisors did not want to ol
fend the fans of the opposing
team.
What? Were the rain-soaked
I lusk\ boosters going to throw oil
their North Fate raiutoats and
stoim the field because we waved
the flag in their fate? Were the
IJSC. supporters going to put
down their cell phones and
< liardonnav and riot?
At Colorado, tlie\ stampede a
live buflalo — bis name is Ralphie
on the field. At Florida State,
they mark the beginning of eat li
game bv driving a flaming spear
into the ground. Stanford's trade
mark is not a bison or even a flam
ing tomahawk. Its a big piece of
red fabric with a white "S" on it.
At most events — notably base
ball — there is no student section
and no organized rallies for sup
port of the team. II there's a
home field advantage at all l< >i our
team, I'm not sure what it is ex
cept toi 1 1 it- sil k\ sounds of Match
box LM) and | <>1111 I esli that plav
on the loudspeakers between in
nings.
I he first cause of tins dearth ol
fan support is the ti< ket policies.
11l let St .m lord off the I lot >k for
this weekentl because it was an
NC.AA event, not technically a
Stanford event, but, at every
other home game, students who
buy ti< kets have three choices in
seating arrangements — the two
lawns down the first- and third
base lines, which are pretty far
from the field and chock-full ol
little leaguers running around
buying Red Vines and i basing
down foul balls, and one section

ol seals at the end of the third
base line, right next to the oppos
ing team's dugout.
Whv not let students sit in nou
gcneral admissions seats in a rau
cous student section above Stan
ford's dugout?
I he simple answer is the
almighty but k.
Even someone who missed out
on Taylor's wisdom in Kcon 1
knows tli.it it would be sillv to sell
student lit kets at lower prices
when you can fill the same seats
with pi it e\ tit kets sold to alumni
and boosters.
I he only problem with tli.it
logic is that the essence of sports
is not something that can be
quantified with economic mod
els. I he players on the field ben
efit immeasurably from the sup
port of fans, especially those who
cheer cnthusiastit.lll\.
Game in and game out,
Sunken Diamond is parked with
legions of , how shall we say, "age
enhanced" boosters whose aver
age time on this e.u th is nearing .i
full geologit time period.
I give these lolks a ton of < red
it for coming out to support the
team, as I damn well plan to be
watt lung baseball when I'm MO.
I lie only problem is thev don't
cheer. I hey don't stand up and
scream.
Some aren't even that nit e. At a
game two weekends ago against
Ai izona, .i li iend and I were talk
ing baseball tluring the game, |iisi
t hatting about pit* lies and the
lineup. I he lath in front of us
turned around and rudely asked
il "(we| were here to talk or to
watt li a game."
Shortly thereaftei, her hus
band tut tied around and started .i
lively conversation with us. I pre
sume they 're now tlivoi t etl ot slit
has routined him to the Shady
At res retirement < ommunity.
When the baseball team plays
.it home, there is absolutely no
home- field advantage in tei ins of
fan support. Last year, when we
played Nebraska in the super-re
gional .it home, there were pist .is
many ( oi nluiskers as there wei e
Cardinal fans, and their intensity
level dwai fetl that of our lans.
I he set outl problem at
Sunken Diamond is the cadre ol
red-jacketed event staffeis pa
trolling the stands and generally
working to cradit ate all instances
of fan support that might pop up.
I'm sure these fellows are
wonderful people and that the
Athletics Department values
their contribution to keeping
the peace at Stanford events, but

this is a baseball game, not an
opera, for Clod's sake.
In the first game on Saturday,
mv friends and I were sitting 011
the general admission lawn 011
the third-base side. Early in the
game, the I'exas third baseman
made a throwing error. We re
sponded h\ heckling him .1 little
bit. No cursing. No personal in
sults. Just a little "nice throw,
three-nine" (39 being his num
ber). Almost immediately, the
event staffer ambled over and
told us to stop, that there would
be none of that during the game.
I could just imagine the follow
ing conversation during a Duke
basketball game .it Cameron In
door Stadium: "I'll, sir . . . Yes,
you in the blue face paint . . .
Could you stop all that hootin'
and hollcrin' . . . You might of
fend someone on the<>ther team."
hut, wait, it gets worse.
During Sunday's first game
against I'exas, two precocious 10-
year-olds made .1 sign that said
something to the effet t of "Wai 11-
ing: Mat! Cow outbreak in Palo
Alto —Co home Longhorns."
I hey walked it around the Stan
ford section, getting .1 modest
(beer from the crowd, much to
their delight.
Later in the game, one of the
voting bows walked In looking
glum. We asked him what was
wrong, and lie reported that, "the
old man had taken Ins sign away
from liiin." We inquired which
one, and lit- replied, " I he one in
the red jacket."
I his is Amerit a. If a boy can't
walk around with a funin sign at
,1 baseball game leasing the other
team, then I'm moving to Cuba
and 1.1 king up interpretive dam e.
So what should be done, you
ask?
I he Athletics Department
must fiist become aware of the
pioblein and then take action to
make student participation a
more important part of 0111 sto
ned athletic tradition. I would
love to see student sections given
prime seating at all spotting
events and department support
of fan-first programs that will en
courage more students to tome
to games to have Inn doing it.
It will go a long way toward
making Stanford's sporting tradi
tion \\ li.it it oinjn to lie.

When the baseball team plays

I he set outl problem at
Sunken Diamond is the cadre ol

working to cradit ate all instances
of fan support that might pop up.
I'm sure these fellows are
wonderful people and that the
Athletics Department values
their contribution to keeping
the peace at Stanford events, but

this is a baseball game, not an
opera, for Clod's sake.
In the first game on Saturday,
mv friends and I were sitting 011
the general admission lawn 011
the third-base side. Early in the
game, the I'exas third baseman
made a throwing error. We re
sponded h\ heckling him .1 little
bit. No cursing. No personal in
sults. Just a little "nice throw,
three-nine" (39 being his num
ber). Almost immediately, the
event staffer ambled over and
told us to stop, that there would
be none of that during the game.
I could just imagine the follow
ing conversation during a Duke
basketball game .it Cameron In
door Stadium: "I'll, sir . . . Yes,
you in the blue face paint . . .
Could you stop all that hootin'
and hollcrin' . . . You might of
fend someone on the<>ther team."
hut, wait, it gets worse.
During Sunday's first game
against I'exas, two precocious 10-
year-olds made .1 sign that said
something to the effet t of "Wai 11-
ing: Mat! Cow outbreak in Palo
Alto —Co home Longhorns."
I hey walked it around the Stan
ford section, getting .1 modest
(beer from the crowd, much to
their delight.
Later in the game, one of the
voting bows walked In looking
glum. We asked him what was
wrong, and lie reported that, "the
old man had taken Ins sign away

one, and lit- replied, " I he one in

I his is Amerit a. If a boy can't

So what should be done, you
ask?
I he Athletics Department
must fiist become aware of the

make student participation a

love to see student sections given
prime seating at all spotting

in a while. I he only problem was
that I was one of less than 50 Stan
ford students in attendance
among the nearly capacity crowd
at Sunken Diamond.
1 his column is an open letter to
the Stanford community, the De
partment of Athletics and Athletics
Directoi led Lelatid, asking lh.it
we make our athletic s facilities (not
just in baseball) more accessible
and encouraging to student sup
port of our athletes.
At Stanford, we have the
unique opportunit\ to witness an
unbelievably broad spectrum of
athletic success in some of the na
tion's best facilities. I lowever, be
cause of a number of Athletic s I )e
-partment decisions, we as students
are stilled in our abilities to utilize
these opportunities, and our ath
letes are robbed of the full support
of the student body that should be
commensurate with their endless
hours ol hard work.
Fan support, especially from
students, is an integral c omponent
in developing a legac \ of sporting
excellence. I rom basketball at
Duke and football at 1 exas A&M
to baseball at 1 .ouisianna Stale and

<lfiil < i (>wds are vital to the sut cess
of these programs.
In maii\ sports, the tiling that
holds Stanford back, from achiev
ing the same calibei tradition .is its
peel s is not the- performance of the
athletes on the field, hut the per
formatK e of tlu- fans in tlu- stands.
Never before have I seen a
s( hool that does less to encourage
students to be involved in < heel
ing foi tlieii athletic teams —
nevermind one that has won six
straight Sears I)iret toi s' ( aips.
Sure, we've got the- Sixth Man
( luf). and it's all well and good,
but that's about where it ends.
At football games this year, yell
leadei s were not permitted to run
tlu- flag all tlu- wa\ around the sta
dium track after we scored a
touchdown because the facilities
supervisors did not want to ol
fend the fans of the opposing
team.
What? Were the rain-soaked
I lusk\ boosters going to throw oil
their North Fate raiutoats and
stoim the field because we waved
the flag in their fate? Were the
IJSC. supporters going to put
down their cell phones and
< liardonnav and riot?
At Colorado, tlie\ stampede a
live buflalo — bis name is Ralphie
on the field. At Florida State,
they mark the beginning of eat li
game bv driving a flaming spear
into the ground. Stanford's trade
mark is not a bison or even a flam
ing tomahawk. Its a big piece of
red fabric with a white "S" on it.
At most events — notably base
ball — there is no student section
and no organized rallies for sup
port of the team. II there's a
home field advantage at all l< >i our
team, I'm not sure what it is ex
cept toi 1 1 it- sil k\ sounds of Match
box LM) and | <>1111 I esli that plav
on the loudspeakers between in
nings.
I he first cause of tins dearth ol
fan support is the ti< ket policies.
11l let St .m lord off the I lot >k for
this weekentl because it was an
NC.AA event, not technically a
Stanford event, but, at every
other home game, students who
buy ti< kets have three choices in
seating arrangements — the two
lawns down the first- and third
base lines, which are pretty far
from the field and chock-full ol
little leaguers running around
buying Red Vines and i basing
down foul balls, and one section

ol seals at the end of the third
base line, right next to the oppos
ing team's dugout.
Whv not let students sit in nou
gcneral admissions seats in a rau
cous student section above Stan
ford's dugout?
I he simple answer is the
almighty but k.
Even someone who missed out
on Taylor's wisdom in Kcon 1
knows tli.it it would be sillv to sell
student lit kets at lower prices
when you can fill the same seats
with pi it e\ tit kets sold to alumni
and boosters.
I he only problem with tli.it
logic is that the essence of sports
is not something that can be
quantified with economic mod
els. I he players on the field ben
efit immeasurably from the sup
port of fans, especially those who
cheer cnthusiastit.lll\.
Game in and game out,
Sunken Diamond is parked with
legions of , how shall we say, "age
enhanced" boosters whose aver
age time on this e.u th is nearing .i
full geologit time period.
I give these lolks a ton of < red
it for coming out to support the
team, as I damn well plan to be
watt lung baseball when I'm MO.
I lie only problem is thev don't
cheer. I hey don't stand up and
scream.
Some aren't even that nit e. At a
game two weekends ago against
Ai izona, .i li iend and I were talk
ing baseball tluring the game, |iisi
t hatting about pit* lies and the
lineup. I he lath in front of us
turned around and rudely asked
il "(we| were here to talk or to
watt li a game."
Shortly thereaftei, her hus
band tut tied around and started .i
lively conversation with us. I pre

When the baseball team plays
.it home, there is absolutely no
home- field advantage in tei ins of
fan support. Last year, when we
played Nebraska in the super-re
gional .it home, there were pist .is
many ( oi nluiskers as there wei e
Cardinal fans, and their intensity
level dwai fetl that of our lans.
I he set outl problem at
Sunken Diamond is the cadre ol
red-jacketed event staffeis pa
trolling the stands and generally
working to cradit ate all instances
of fan support that might pop up.
I'm sure these fellows are
wonderful people and that the
Athletics Department values
their contribution to keeping
the peace at Stanford events, but

this is a baseball game, not an
opera, for Clod's sake.
In the first game on Saturday,
mv friends and I were sitting 011
the general admission lawn 011
the third-base side. Early in the
game, the I'exas third baseman
made a throwing error. We re
sponded h\ heckling him .1 little
bit. No cursing. No personal in
sults. Just a little "nice throw,
three-nine" (39 being his num
ber). Almost immediately, the
event staffer ambled over and
told us to stop, that there would
be none of that during the game.
I could just imagine the follow
ing conversation during a Duke
basketball game .it Cameron In
door Stadium: "I'll, sir . . . Yes,
you in the blue face paint . . .
Could you stop all that hootin'
and hollcrin' . . . You might of
fend someone on the<>ther team."
hut, wait, it gets worse.
During Sunday's first game
against I'exas, two precocious 10-
year-olds made .1 sign that said
something to the effet t of "Wai 11-
ing: Mat! Cow outbreak in Palo
Alto —Co home Longhorns."
I hey walked it around the Stan
ford section, getting .1 modest
(beer from the crowd, much to
their delight.
Later in the game, one of the
voting bows walked In looking
glum. We asked him what was
wrong, and lie reported that, "the
old man had taken Ins sign away
from liiin." We inquired which
one, and lit- replied, " I he one in
the red jacket."
I his is Amerit a. If a boy can't
walk around with a funin sign at
,1 baseball game leasing the other
team, then I'm moving to Cuba
and 1.1 king up interpretive dam e.
So what should be done, you
ask?
I he Athletics Department
must fiist become aware of the
pioblein and then take action to
make student participation a
more important part of 0111 sto
ned athletic tradition. I would
love to see student sections given
prime seating at all spotting
events and department support
of fan-first programs that will en
courage more students to tome
to games to have Inn doing it.
It will go a long way toward
making Stanford's sporting tradi
tion \\ li.it it oinjn to lie.
