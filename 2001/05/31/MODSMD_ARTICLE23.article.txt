## Stanford needs to support fans Student supporters are a necessary part of a strong athletics program 
### 
This weekend, Stanford's
Sunken Diamond was
host to some of the most
exciting collegiate base
hall of the year.
I pset by third-seeded I ex.is m

the winner's
bracket game on
Saturday, Stan
ford needed to
knock off spunk)
underdog Marist
(from Pough
keepsie, N.Y, il
vou're curious) in
Saturday's night
cap and then take

two games from l ex.is on SundaN
to continue its march toward the
College World Scries in ()maha.
In a fantastic day <>l baseball,
the Card stored in the bottom <>l
the 10th to take the first game,
10-9, from the l.onghorns and
then scored three runs in the
eighth to come from behind and
win, 4-H, in the second game,
winning the regional.
I was in attendance loi all four
of the Saturday and Sunday
games, and ii was some of the most

exciting sports action I have seen
in a while. I he only problem was
that I was one of less than 50 Stan
ford students in attendance
among the nearly capacity crowd
at Sunken Diamond.
1 his column is an open letter to
the Stanford community, the De
partment of Athletics and Athletics
Directoi led Lelatid, asking lh.it
we make our athletic s facilities (not
just in baseball) more accessible
and encouraging to student sup
port of our athletes.
At Stanford, we have the
unique opportunit\ to witness an
unbelievably broad spectrum of
athletic success in some of the na
tion's best facilities. I lowever, be
cause of a number of Athletic s I )e
-partment decisions, we as students
are stilled in our abilities to utilize
these opportunities, and our ath
letes are robbed of the full support
of the student body that should be
commensurate with their endless
hours ol hard work.
Fan support, especially from
students, is an integral c omponent
in developing a legac \ of sporting
excellence. I rom basketball at
Duke and football at 1 exas A&M
to baseball at 1 .ouisianna Stale and
wrestling .it lowa, energetic , sup
portive (I'll even sav rowdv) stu
