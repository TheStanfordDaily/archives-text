EU(JKNK, ()re — After (lit* first
day of competition at the NCAA
I rack and Field Championships,
the Cardinal athletes have their
work work cut lor them in order to
defend their national title.
Wednesday's events did not
work in Stanford's lavor, as sev
eral serious disappointments re
sulted in zero pouts for the men's
track squad.
"It was a day lot the

Cardinal," said senior Michael
Stember. "It lakes .1 little bit of
luck to win these meets. I he ball
has rolled our way in the past,
and it didn't today."
Starting Stanford's series of
misfortunes was sophomore
Jason Coil's withdrawal from the
decathlon.
Alter running the 100 meters,
the first event in the decathlon, in
1 1.43 seconds. Coifs shoulder
injury — which he received dur
ing a hand-off in the 4-by-100-
meter relay at the Pacific 10 Con

ference Championships —
forced him to pull out of the rest
of the competition.
(loll''was not the only athlete hit
with hard lurk in the decathlon.
Claston Bernard of Louisian Stale,
favored to win ihe competition,
missed the long jump and are re
sult of injury, Cutler NCAA rules,
Bernard, like (1011, will not be al
lowed to reenter when competition
resumes on Ihursday.
I,SI s loss of potential points in
the decathlon works to the Cardi
nal's advantage, hut Wednesday's
events unfortunately resulted in .1
Stanford shutout.
Junior jonathon Riley placed
ninth in the 10,000 meters in <1 time
of' 10:00.40, one place shv of scor
ing a point. Notre Dame's Ryan
Shay won the race in 29:05.44,
breaking Stanford's three-year
reign in the event. Brad 11, inset
captured the 10,000-meter c rown
in 1998 <md 2000, while Nathan
Nutter was the lirst to cross the line
in 1999.
Cardinal junior Chad Wassink
finished 1 Itli in the javelin with .1
throw of 210 feet, .'i inches, two
places away from 111, iking the
final round.
The biggest upset of the day for
the Cardinal, however, was junior
Calx- Jennings's fourth-place fin
ish 111 his preliminary 800-meter
lie.it, which did not qualify him lor
the event finals.
Coming down the hist 100 me
ters in a light pack, Jennings was
boxed in by oilier runners, which
hindered his usual, potent finish
ing kick.
Jennings's, time of 1:48.58 was a
frustrating 0.08 seconds slower
than the last qualifier's time.
A bright spot in the midst of
Stanford's troubles was Steml)cr's
win in his heat of the 800 meters.
Though only a preliminary
heat, meaning no points were
scored, the event showed Stember
to be in top form, as he won in dra
matic fashion, alleviating the fears
of nervous Stanford fans who
watched Stemlx-r sit near the back
of the pack for most of he race.

of' 10:00.40, one place shv of scor
ing a point. Notre Dame's Ryan
Shay won the race in 29:05.44,

finished 1 Itli in the javelin with .1
throw of 210 feet, .'i inches, two
places away from 111, iking the
final round.
The biggest upset of the day for
the Cardinal, however, was junior
Calx- Jennings's fourth-place fin
ish 111 his preliminary 800-meter
lie.it, which did not qualify him lor
the event finals.
Coming down the hist 100 me
ters in a light pack, Jennings was
boxed in by oilier runners, which
hindered his usual, potent finish
ing kick.
Jennings's, time of 1:48.58 was a
frustrating 0.08 seconds slower
than the last qualifier's time.
A bright spot in the midst of
Stanford's troubles was Steml)cr's
win in his heat of the 800 meters.
Though only a preliminary
heat, meaning no points were
scored, the event showed Stember
to be in top form, as he won in dra
matic fashion, alleviating the fears
of nervous Stanford fans who
watched Stemlx-r sit near the back
of the pack for most of he race.
