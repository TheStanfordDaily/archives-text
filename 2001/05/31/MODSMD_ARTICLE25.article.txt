Starting Stanford's series of
misfortunes was sophomore

forced him to pull out of the rest
of the competition.

ninth in the 10,000 meters in <1 time
of' 10:00.40, one place shv of scor
ing a point. Notre Dame's Ryan
Shay won the race in 29:05.44,

finished 1 Itli in the javelin with .1
throw of 210 feet, .'i inches, two
places away from 111, iking the
final round.
The biggest upset of the day for
the Cardinal, however, was junior
Calx- Jennings's fourth-place fin
ish 111 his preliminary 800-meter
lie.it, which did not qualify him lor
the event finals.
Coming down the hist 100 me
ters in a light pack, Jennings was
boxed in by oilier runners, which
hindered his usual, potent finish
ing kick.
Jennings's, time of 1:48.58 was a
frustrating 0.08 seconds slower
than the last qualifier's time.
A bright spot in the midst of
Stanford's troubles was Steml)cr's
win in his heat of the 800 meters.
Though only a preliminary
heat, meaning no points were
scored, the event showed Stember
to be in top form, as he won in dra
matic fashion, alleviating the fears
of nervous Stanford fans who
watched Stemlx-r sit near the back
of the pack for most of he race.
