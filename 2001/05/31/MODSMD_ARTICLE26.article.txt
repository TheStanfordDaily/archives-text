"A dream come true" is liovv sophomore out
fielder Cassi Mrangham described I lie 2001 Stan
lord softb<ill season.
I his year, the- Stanford soil hall team (54-15-1) pro
pelled its program to another level — three presea
son tournament c hampionships, a regional c hampi
onship, a trip to the Women's College World Series
and .1 best ever third-place finish.
Before the 2001 campaign, the Stanford Softball
team was a respected program, having been ranked
in the top 25 in every national poll since 1998. This
year, however, the Cardinal did everything anyone
expec ted and more.
I he- team reached a best ever ranking of No. in
the nation and remained at No. for five weeks, hold
ing a spot in the top five since February.
The Stanford team has always been good and
proven itself to be a worthy opponent, but this year
was different.
"I think that this year we just stayed mentally
tough," senior |enni Shideler said. "We stayed to

get her and battled through the rough parts. We had
the confidence and beliel in ourselves to succeed."
Hi is belief and conlidcnc e was coupled with talent.
For the first time in (iardinal history, three Stan

Americans. Juniors Jessica Mendo/.a and Sarah
lieeson led the squad at the plate, both boasting bat
ting averages over .400, while sophomore Dana
Sorensen dominated in the circle with 27 wins and
295 strikeouts.
As the (iardinal celebrates this season's end and ac
complishments, the trio has gone on to San Diego,
where it was invited to participate in the Amateur
Softball Association national tamp, from which the
()lympic team is eventually chosen.
While Mendo/a, Hccson and Sorensen have been
adorned with many honors, the difference between
this year's team and those that came before can be at
tributed to the depth of the Stanford s(|iiad.
"This year was a huge team effort," Robin Walker
said. "II the top of the lineup was struggling, the bot
tom of the lineup would come through."
Players coming through in the dutch is what al
lowed Stanford to win big games all vear. Historical
rival and Softball powerhouse California threatened
the Cardinal in the second meeting of the year. How
ever, the battle was ended when Shideler sent a tow
ering home run over the fence to win the game for
