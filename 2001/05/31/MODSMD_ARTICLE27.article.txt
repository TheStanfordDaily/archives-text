# Announcers make L.A. sports

### 
Every spring quartet while on the Farm, I re
alize how spoiled 1 am ai home. Downright
pampered, to be exact. After listening to drv,
bland sportseasters for months, I realize jusi
how fortunate 1 have been during all those veai s bat k
home in I.os Angeles.
lint this spi ing, the onlv time when one can be in
spoils paradise b\ listening to Lakers play-bv-plav
announcer ( bit k I learn and Dodgers announcer
Vin Scully on the same day as the start of the base
ball season nierues with the end ol the basketball

season, I have tome to the sad real
ization iliat tins Southern (lalifoi
iiia birthright will one day come to
.in end.
Scullv announces fewet games
and innings as the years go by,
while I learn li.is missed bits of
games because of various ailments,
though I leai us HOOO-plns consec
utive-game streak, dating bat k to
Nov. (i, 1905, makes (lal Ripken
look like Hill Walton.

I o pni ii simply, for people who have nevei lis
lened to these golden throats, 1 learn and Seullv
are the best there ever was or will be in their re
spet live fields.
lo argue with iliis statement is as ridiculous and
wrong as saving |< >t Wolf w as a better basketball plav
fi ih.in Mk hael Jordan or Sputl Webb is tallei than
Shawn Bradley,
I can't even imagine — and I dread — the da\
wlien I will be listening to self-glorif\ ing annount ei s
who spend more time with hyperbole .1 1it 1 pomp
ill.in at lu.illv t ailing the game. < )r worse, not even
< ailing the game .it all.
Km enough negative thinking.
I learn and Sculk are perfect foi theii respec
tive sp< >rts.
S( 1111 \, with Ins melodic and soothing voice, calls
the Icisureh game of baseball as il he is painting
one big siorv, like a grant I fat bet telling a tale to his
gi antic 1 iiltii t n.
Mis memorable call of Sa tit I \ koufax's first perfect
game would make an\ v\ i ilei envious. Ii is niinclbog
gling how he tomes up with spontaneous descrip
tions thai seem lo get betlei as the moment bet tunes
more important.
" I luce times in his sensational careei lias Santk
Konlax walked out to the mound lo pitt Ii a fateful
ninth where lie turned m a no-hitter. But, tonight,
Seplembei the ninth, nineteen hundred and si\i\-
five, he made the toughest walk of Ins career, I'm
sure, l>e< ause. through eight innings, he lias pitt lied
a pel feci game.
"And vou can almost taste the pressure now. Ko
ufax lifted Ins c ap, ran Ins lingei s through Ins black
hair, ilien millet I I lie can I>.k k down, fussiim at I lie

bill. King must feel it too as he backs out, heaves a
sigh, takes oil Ins helmet, puis ii bat k oil and steps
back up to ilie plate .. . And there s 29.0(H) people in
the ball|>.u k and a million butterflies."
Scull \ lias not i hanged at all. As a testament to Ins
greatness, when 112 ox's |oe Buck was preparing for
Fox's tin n-back-the-clock broadcast, he listened to
tapes of Sc ullv even though Ins fatliei. |Ac k Buck, is
also a I tall ol Fame annount ci for the (..u tlinals.
1 fe.u n, with Ins quick wit and razor-sharp niemo
iv, biilliant 1\ mi ns pieces of the fast-paced game of
basketball into beautiful mosaics. B\ coining now
tonunoiiplat e terms sut h as slain tlunk, airball, tlrib
blc-tlrive, garbage time, fingei roil and give-and-go,
he lias helped listeners visualize the action on the
"94-bv-f>o hunk of wood."
But, apart frtun theii stvles, St ullv and I learn
both assume their audience is blind. I he pair are
referred lo as Fos Angeles's poet laureates, leg
ends wlit) paint pit tines vivid enough for all to see
and enjoy.
When ibe\ built their t arecrs in the middle of the
ccnturv, iliev were also building a fan base for their
respective spoils in Southern ('.alifbrnia. When the
Dodgers and I akei s brought baseball and basketball
to the- West, these annount ers taught and advertised
the sports with their dest i iptit)iis.
When basketball and baseball were not promi
nentk splashed on telex ision, I leai n and St ullv were
the fat es ol theii teams. Fans have constanth t liosen
Sc ulh as their favorite Dodgei over greats like Jackie
Robinson, Don Drvsdale and Santk Koulax. Like
wise, l.akei fans have c rowned 1 learn over legends
snt Ii as kareeni Abdul-|ahbar, Jerrv West, Flgin
Bavloi and Magic |olinson as their favorite "Laker."
Max ing annount ft! during a simpler era < »112 sports,
Sc nll\ and I learn have an uncaiim abilitv to bridge
the past with the present. I hex hoih sei xe as links be
tween fatliei sand sons, between an era of "team first
It) a time of"me first."
As the Dodgers are cinrentlv in the beat of a
luisc cut pennant i at e. St ullv c an weave in similarities
with the scrappx Los Angeles squad of I ( .)NK.
I learn bridges I he t»i iginal ' Show time" generation
ol the 1980s with the Showtime 11 generation of Lak
ei s that are si cam rolling through the N BA plavoffs.
I he games come alive listening to these two leg
ends. Inn I know that, while their words are immor
tal. ihc\ aie not.
In I leai n's words, when their t arecrs are "in the
re ti igerator: I he tlooi \s < losetl, the light's are out,
the butt ei's getting hart I.the eggs are tooling and the
jello is jiggling. S< ulk's iratleinai k, "Would \ou be
lieve .... will be just the right response.

\nthony /vr, a sophomore, hopes llie l/ikns and Dodgers
Ix/tli win iluiin/noiisliif)s for Ileum and Scully's sake. He
mil be reathed ill <iilee(i> stiinliird.edu.
