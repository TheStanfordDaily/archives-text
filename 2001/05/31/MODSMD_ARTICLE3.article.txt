people correlates to the amount <>1
responsibility he carries. In recent
times, a few prominent issues have
tested the strength and integrity of
his leadership.
Acts of intolerance

white supremacist and anti-Asian
messages were discovered

Stanford News Service
President John Hennessy has faced a number of difficult issues in his first year,
including racist graffiti, controversy over Commencement speaker Carly Fio
rina and the continued loss of revenue by the Medical Center.
and countless dialogue.
Much of that dialogue was io
nised on Hennessy's role in ad
dressing the issue of racist graffiti.
"It [has become evident] just
how quiet Hennessy has been as
president of the University," said
«in April 25 Daily editorial. "One
would think that a crime as offen
sive and harmful as hate graffiti
would elicit a powerful response
from the University, especially the
president. But rather than imme
diately releasing a statement that
strongly condemned such acts of
hate and racism, Hennessy spoke
briefly and then let lower adminis
trators handle the rest... By ne
glecting to take a hard-line ap
proach to these hate crimes, Hen
nessy failed many members of the
Stanford community."
Not so, said Hennessy.
" The (racist graffiti] issue was
kept low-profile because it seems
.is though we are dealing with a
single individual, and, thus, [we]
didn't want to give that individual
the attention [he or she] desired,"
he said. "Being president, you
have to make c alls that [will not be
supported by] everyone in the
University community."
Senior Seiji Yamamoto said he
shared this view.
"Being the president of a uni
versity is a difficult job because of
the unrealistic expectations many
people may have," he said. "It's
easy to forget about John Hen
nessy the human being and only
focus on the duties of his office. It's
true th.it he has the most power of
any one individual to effect
change, but the power we entrust
ed him was not a deification.
"To be honest, I don't think
he's had enough time to really
prove himself, so I'd [prefer] to
postpone judgment fora while.
Now. we currently face a number
of problems, though in my view
they are not attributable to either
[former University President (ier
liard] Casper or Hennessy, but
merely an unfortunate conscience
of factors."
(Xher students said they disagreed.
"Though President Hennessy

might have done some amazing
things this year, the one event that
has tainted [my opinion of him| is
his poor reaction to the hateci lines
on campus,'' said one sophomore.
"I believe that, at any other univer
sity, the president would have real
ly had a strong reaction to such
liate c rimes and would have taken
action immediately.
"Instead, Hennessy delegated
the responsibility to deal with the
hate crimes to lower administra
tors and seemed quite reluctant to
aggressively combat such rac ism.
It makes me sad that the adminis
tration does not feel that the safety
of students of color is a top prioi i
ty here."
"Downsizing" of the humanities?
Other issues have warranted
administrative response this year.
The proposed merger of six de
partments — Asian Languages,
Comparative Literature, Herman
Studies, Slavic Languages and
Literatures and Spanish & Por
tuguese — into the Department
of Languages, (lultures and Liter
atures led many frustrated stu
dents to protest the University
and Hennessy's "downsizing" of
the humanities.
Rush Rehm, an associate pro
fessor of drama and classics, told
the Stanford Report the proposal
was intellectually "vacuous" and
that terms in the proposed plan,
like "strength" and "flexibility,"
were being used for cover.
"There's flexibility in this uni
versity all over the place," Rehm
said. "There's nothing stopping
faculty at this university from get
ting together and doing things
they want. Do we really need to
throw a lot of people together that
don't want to lx- together in order
to develop flexibility?"
In addition to the issue of de
partmentalization, said other fac
ulty members, is concern for re
cruitment in general.
"We have seen our numbers
shrink over the last several years,
with departing faculty members
not always being replaced," Clas
sics Prof. Joshua said. "The
longer key positions remain un
filled, the worse our situation,
since we risk entering a vicious
circle; small numbers of faculty
translates to a small pool of de

pariment graduates, which in
turn 111.1 kc-s ii hard to justify the
recruitment ol new laculty. What
President llennessy could do .11
this point, in my view, is simply to
make funds available lor the re
< 1 uitment ol top scholars — inde
pendently ol the [proposed de
partment merger]."
llennessy said he has made a
promise not to reduce the com
mitment lo the humanities, 111
keeping with Casper's successes
in ili.it area, and that accusations
to the contrary are untrue. Three
hundred million ol the recent
$100 million Hewlett Foundation
gift will go toward funding for the
School ol Humanities and Sci
ences. which has identified needs
totaling more ilian $1 billion.
I he present structure ol
things would not have contributed
to the structure and success of [the
language departments]," llen
nessy said. "The whole goal of the
proposed merger is to strengthen
.uid put more resources into the
humanities, not to [confound] its
identity."
Provost John Ktchemendy said
he agreed, calling the negative
charges leveled at llennessy "un
fair in the extreme."
"The prop<>sal to merge the lan
guage departments was actually
my decision, and John approved
it," Ktchemendy said. " The deci
sion was made not because ol bud
get reasons. Die cheapest thing we
can do is to leave things they way
they are now."
According to Kli/abeth Bern
hardt, director ol the Language
(-enter and a (ierman studies pro
lessor. the proposed department
merger would allow lot a greater,
not smaller, diversity of curricula.
"At present, smaller languages
at Stanford have no academic
home other than in the Special
languages Program," said Bern
hardt, who supports the merger
initiative. "This means that, under
the present structure, we can
never make an academic council
appointment in Hebrew or Arabic
or Swahili. This puts us in a vul
nerable position vis a vis graduate
student interest."
"But, more importantly, this
configuration is simply wrong.
There is substantial interest
around campus in the Middle Kast

and Africa. The literatures and
(ultures of these areas are critical
and yet there is no way fora Stan
lord student to explore these liter
atures and cultures with specialists
in the area."
I hough some faculty, staff and
students said they were dissatisfied
with the proposed merger itself,
many assented to Etchemendy's
plan to appoint a committee to
study it.
"I welcome lYovost Etchemendy's
decision lo convene a Blue Ribbon
('.oininittee," said Jeffrey Schnapp,
i hair ol the Department of French
and Italian, who opposes the
merger plan. " I he current pro
posal was not only flawed as re
gards process, but also, and more
importantly, failed to take advan
tage of what, in reality, was an
enormous opportunity to think
boldly and imaginatively about
possible futures lor the literary dis
ciplines at Stanford."
Commencement speaker choices
Hennessy's selection of Carly
Fiorina, president and chief ex
ecutive officer of Hewlett-
Packard, as this year's Com
mencement speaker also drew
criticism from students. Perhaps
fueled by Hewlett-Packard's cor
porate ties or, [as some said], be
cause Fiorina was not "inspira
tional" or "famous" enough, the
debate raged on.
"I think that Carly Fiorina was
chosen because of the University's
ties to [Hewlett-Packard| and the
need to maintain their donations
despite Hewlett's recent death,"
senior Krista Glaser said. "What
better way to keep 11P happy with
our University? The Commence
ment speaker is a great prize, and
Stanford gave it to them."
llennessy said he agreed that
there should have been more
communication between the ad
ministration and Senior Class
presidents about the selection
process, but maintained that it is
more challenging than most peo
ple expect.
Some students, when asked,
said they would prefer it if Hen
nessy communicated more with
the student body in general.
"He needs to have a greater
presence in the community," said
one sophomore. "He should Ik*

going to student group meetings,
talking at dining halls and really
interacting with the people here.
"A lot of people generally have
no idea of what llennessy is up
to, and, while that might be the
workings of a humble man, it is
also really annoying because no
one ever has any idea of what ad
ministrative changes will be
made until they are about to be
implemented."
I n response to criticism of Fior
ina's Hewlett-Packard connection,
I lenncssy cited her background in
the humanities. Fiorina majored
in Medieval history and philoso
phy at Stanford.
"I sought, on your hehall and
on behalf of the graduate stu
dents with whom you share this
ceremony, a Commencement
speaker whose accomplishments,
contributions and ability to inllu
ence the world gave him or her a
distinctive point of view from
which to oiler advice about issues
of consequent e," I lennessy wrote
in an e-mail to the Senior Class.
"As has been tradition, we gave
priority to speakers with a Stan
ford connection."
"We have a world-class Com
mencement speaker," I lenncssy
continued.
"She is considered the most
powerful and influential woman
in the business today, and the
technology revolution she helps
drive will influence your genera
tion and those of your children
and grandchildren in ways we can
only imagine."
Medical Center finances
I he issue of financial losses in
the Medical Center has also con
fronted llennessy in his first year.
I he 1997 Balanced Budged Act
has had significant consequences
for academic medical centers
across the nation. According to
Philip Pizzo, the newly appointed
dean of the School of Medicine, fi
nancial problems at Stanford Hos
pitals and Clinics have been partic
ularly significant following the un
successful merger then de-merger
of Stanford with UC-San Francis
co, which officially terminated a
year ago.
"During the past months, [Stan
ford Hospitals and Clinics] has
been working diligently to reduce

these financial losses," Pizzo said.
"Because he has recognized the
importance of the relationship of
[hospitals <»nd clinics], as well as the
Lucille Packard Children's Hospi
tal, to the School of Medicine, Pres
ident Hennessy has assumed an
important leadership role. He has
recognized the problems lacing
academic medical centers are pre
dominantly related to the fact that
payment lot clinical services, by
HMOs, insurance companies and
state and federal programs, are
below their actual cost.
"[Hennessy's] leadership also
extends to entrusting the leaders
of the Medical Center to work
more successfully on beliall of the
future ol the Stanford University
School of Medicine because of its
importance to the future ol chil
dren and adults and because of the
important and integral role it plays
in the University," Pizzo said.
Looking forward
Pizzo is one of several professors
to receive deanships in the past
year under Hennessy, a fact lie
said is significant because it high
lights the relative youth of Hen
nessy's administration.
"The changing landscape of
Stanford itself, both physical and
organizational, rellects tlu- con
stantly evolving nature of the
times. Concerns, complaints and
compliments notwithstanding,
Hennessy's administration is still
in its early stages."
In offering his opinion of what
Stanford embodies, Hennessy
drew upon the Founders' goals
and others that c ame before him.
"David Starr Jordan, speaking
from the West Portal of the Quad
on that opening day 109 years ago,
made this point with eloquence
and simplicity: 'Our university is
hallowed by no traditions,' " 1 len
nessv said during his inauguration
speech Oct. 20, 2000. " It is ham
pered by none. It's linger posts all
point forward.'"
"Happily, in the intervening
years, we have developed many
wonderful traditions." Hennessy
said, "but I am sure you believe, as
I do, that we are still hampered bv
none. Our c hallenges are many,
but our potential is unbounded,
and our linger posts all continue to
point forward."

the responsibility to deal with the
hate crimes to lower administra
tors and seemed quite reluctant to
aggressively combat such rac ism.
It makes me sad that the adminis
tration does not feel that the safety
of students of color is a top prioi i
ty here."
"Downsizing" of the humanities?
Other issues have warranted
administrative response this year.
The proposed merger of six de
partments — Asian Languages,
Comparative Literature, Herman
Studies, Slavic Languages and
Literatures and Spanish & Por
tuguese — into the Department
of Languages, (lultures and Liter
atures led many frustrated stu
dents to protest the University
and Hennessy's "downsizing" of
the humanities.
Rush Rehm, an associate pro
fessor of drama and classics, told
the Stanford Report the proposal
was intellectually "vacuous" and
that terms in the proposed plan,
like "strength" and "flexibility,"
were being used for cover.
"There's flexibility in this uni
versity all over the place," Rehm
said. "There's nothing stopping
faculty at this university from get
ting together and doing things
they want. Do we really need to
throw a lot of people together that
don't want to lx- together in order
to develop flexibility?"
In addition to the issue of de
partmentalization, said other fac
ulty members, is concern for re
cruitment in general.
"We have seen our numbers
shrink over the last several years,
with departing faculty members
not always being replaced," Clas
sics Prof. Joshua said. "The
longer key positions remain un
filled, the worse our situation,
since we risk entering a vicious
circle; small numbers of faculty
translates to a small pool of de

pariment graduates, which in
turn 111.1 kc-s ii hard to justify the
recruitment ol new laculty. What
President llennessy could do .11
this point, in my view, is simply to
make funds available lor the re
< 1 uitment ol top scholars — inde
pendently ol the [proposed de
partment merger]."
llennessy said he has made a
promise not to reduce the com
mitment lo the humanities, 111
keeping with Casper's successes
in ili.it area, and that accusations
to the contrary are untrue. Three
hundred million ol the recent
$100 million Hewlett Foundation
gift will go toward funding for the
School ol Humanities and Sci
ences. which has identified needs
totaling more ilian $1 billion.
I he present structure ol
things would not have contributed
to the structure and success of [the
language departments]," llen
nessy said. "The whole goal of the
proposed merger is to strengthen
.uid put more resources into the
humanities, not to [confound] its
identity."
Provost John Ktchemendy said
he agreed, calling the negative
charges leveled at llennessy "un
fair in the extreme."
"The prop<>sal to merge the lan
guage departments was actually
my decision, and John approved
it," Ktchemendy said. " The deci
sion was made not because ol bud
get reasons. Die cheapest thing we
can do is to leave things they way
they are now."
According to Kli/abeth Bern
hardt, director ol the Language
(-enter and a (ierman studies pro
lessor. the proposed department
merger would allow lot a greater,
not smaller, diversity of curricula.
"At present, smaller languages
at Stanford have no academic
home other than in the Special
languages Program," said Bern
hardt, who supports the merger
initiative. "This means that, under
the present structure, we can
never make an academic council
appointment in Hebrew or Arabic
or Swahili. This puts us in a vul
nerable position vis a vis graduate
student interest."
"But, more importantly, this
configuration is simply wrong.
There is substantial interest
around campus in the Middle Kast

and Africa. The literatures and
(ultures of these areas are critical
and yet there is no way fora Stan
lord student to explore these liter
atures and cultures with specialists
in the area."
I hough some faculty, staff and
students said they were dissatisfied
with the proposed merger itself,
many assented to Etchemendy's
plan to appoint a committee to
study it.
"I welcome lYovost Etchemendy's
decision lo convene a Blue Ribbon
('.oininittee," said Jeffrey Schnapp,
i hair ol the Department of French
and Italian, who opposes the
merger plan. " I he current pro
posal was not only flawed as re
gards process, but also, and more
importantly, failed to take advan
tage of what, in reality, was an
enormous opportunity to think
boldly and imaginatively about
possible futures lor the literary dis
ciplines at Stanford."
Commencement speaker choices
Hennessy's selection of Carly
Fiorina, president and chief ex
ecutive officer of Hewlett-
Packard, as this year's Com
mencement speaker also drew
criticism from students. Perhaps
fueled by Hewlett-Packard's cor
porate ties or, [as some said], be
cause Fiorina was not "inspira
tional" or "famous" enough, the
debate raged on.
"I think that Carly Fiorina was
chosen because of the University's
ties to [Hewlett-Packard| and the
need to maintain their donations
despite Hewlett's recent death,"
senior Krista Glaser said. "What
better way to keep 11P happy with
our University? The Commence
ment speaker is a great prize, and
Stanford gave it to them."
llennessy said he agreed that
there should have been more
communication between the ad
ministration and Senior Class
presidents about the selection
process, but maintained that it is
more challenging than most peo
ple expect.
Some students, when asked,
said they would prefer it if Hen
nessy communicated more with
the student body in general.
"He needs to have a greater
presence in the community," said
one sophomore. "He should Ik*

going to student group meetings,
talking at dining halls and really
interacting with the people here.
"A lot of people generally have
no idea of what llennessy is up
to, and, while that might be the
workings of a humble man, it is
also really annoying because no
one ever has any idea of what ad
ministrative changes will be
made until they are about to be
implemented."
I n response to criticism of Fior
ina's Hewlett-Packard connection,
I lenncssy cited her background in
the humanities. Fiorina majored
in Medieval history and philoso
phy at Stanford.
"I sought, on your hehall and
on behalf of the graduate stu
dents with whom you share this
ceremony, a Commencement
speaker whose accomplishments,
contributions and ability to inllu
ence the world gave him or her a
distinctive point of view from
which to oiler advice about issues
of consequent e," I lennessy wrote
in an e-mail to the Senior Class.
"As has been tradition, we gave
priority to speakers with a Stan
ford connection."
"We have a world-class Com
mencement speaker," I lenncssy
continued.
"She is considered the most
powerful and influential woman
in the business today, and the
technology revolution she helps
drive will influence your genera
tion and those of your children
and grandchildren in ways we can
only imagine."
Medical Center finances
I he issue of financial losses in
the Medical Center has also con
fronted llennessy in his first year.
I he 1997 Balanced Budged Act
has had significant consequences
for academic medical centers
across the nation. According to
Philip Pizzo, the newly appointed
dean of the School of Medicine, fi
nancial problems at Stanford Hos
pitals and Clinics have been partic
ularly significant following the un
successful merger then de-merger
of Stanford with UC-San Francis
co, which officially terminated a
year ago.
"During the past months, [Stan
ford Hospitals and Clinics] has
been working diligently to reduce

these financial losses," Pizzo said.
"Because he has recognized the
importance of the relationship of
[hospitals <»nd clinics], as well as the
Lucille Packard Children's Hospi
tal, to the School of Medicine, Pres
ident Hennessy has assumed an
important leadership role. He has
recognized the problems lacing
academic medical centers are pre
dominantly related to the fact that
payment lot clinical services, by
HMOs, insurance companies and
state and federal programs, are
below their actual cost.
"[Hennessy's] leadership also
extends to entrusting the leaders
of the Medical Center to work
more successfully on beliall of the
future ol the Stanford University
School of Medicine because of its
importance to the future ol chil
dren and adults and because of the
important and integral role it plays
in the University," Pizzo said.
Looking forward
Pizzo is one of several professors
to receive deanships in the past
year under Hennessy, a fact lie
said is significant because it high
lights the relative youth of Hen
nessy's administration.
"The changing landscape of
Stanford itself, both physical and
organizational, rellects tlu- con
stantly evolving nature of the
times. Concerns, complaints and
compliments notwithstanding,
Hennessy's administration is still
in its early stages."
In offering his opinion of what
Stanford embodies, Hennessy
drew upon the Founders' goals
and others that c ame before him.
"David Starr Jordan, speaking
from the West Portal of the Quad
on that opening day 109 years ago,
made this point with eloquence
and simplicity: 'Our university is
hallowed by no traditions,' " 1 len
nessv said during his inauguration
speech Oct. 20, 2000. " It is ham
pered by none. It's linger posts all
point forward.'"
"Happily, in the intervening
years, we have developed many
wonderful traditions." Hennessy
said, "but I am sure you believe, as
I do, that we are still hampered bv
none. Our c hallenges are many,
but our potential is unbounded,
and our linger posts all continue to
point forward."

Acts of intolerance

white supremacist and anti-Asian
messages were discovered

wall of two classrooms in the lane

Building 50. Ihe racist graffiti

Stanford News Service
President John Hennessy has faced a number of difficult issues in his first year,
including racist graffiti, controversy over Commencement speaker Carly Fio
rina and the continued loss of revenue by the Medical Center.
and countless dialogue.
Much of that dialogue was io
nised on Hennessy's role in ad
dressing the issue of racist graffiti.
"It [has become evident] just
how quiet Hennessy has been as
president of the University," said
«in April 25 Daily editorial. "One
would think that a crime as offen
sive and harmful as hate graffiti
would elicit a powerful response
from the University, especially the
president. But rather than imme
diately releasing a statement that
strongly condemned such acts of
hate and racism, Hennessy spoke
briefly and then let lower adminis
trators handle the rest... By ne
glecting to take a hard-line ap
proach to these hate crimes, Hen
nessy failed many members of the
Stanford community."
Not so, said Hennessy.
" The (racist graffiti] issue was
kept low-profile because it seems
.is though we are dealing with a
single individual, and, thus, [we]
didn't want to give that individual
the attention [he or she] desired,"
he said. "Being president, you
have to make c alls that [will not be
supported by] everyone in the
University community."
Senior Seiji Yamamoto said he
shared this view.
"Being the president of a uni
versity is a difficult job because of
the unrealistic expectations many
people may have," he said. "It's
easy to forget about John Hen
nessy the human being and only
focus on the duties of his office. It's
true th.it he has the most power of
any one individual to effect
change, but the power we entrust
ed him was not a deification.
"To be honest, I don't think
he's had enough time to really
prove himself, so I'd [prefer] to
postpone judgment fora while.
Now. we currently face a number
of problems, though in my view
they are not attributable to either
[former University President (ier
liard] Casper or Hennessy, but
merely an unfortunate conscience
of factors."
(Xher students said they disagreed.
"Though President Hennessy

might have done some amazing
things this year, the one event that
has tainted [my opinion of him| is
his poor reaction to the hateci lines
on campus,'' said one sophomore.
"I believe that, at any other univer

and Africa. The literatures and
(ultures of these areas are critical
and yet there is no way fora Stan
lord student to explore these liter
atures and cultures with specialists
in the area."
I hough some faculty, staff and
students said they were dissatisfied
with the proposed merger itself,
many assented to Etchemendy's
plan to appoint a committee to
study it.
"I welcome lYovost Etchemendy's
decision lo convene a Blue Ribbon
('.oininittee," said Jeffrey Schnapp,
i hair ol the Department of French
and Italian, who opposes the
merger plan. " I he current pro
posal was not only flawed as re
gards process, but also, and more
importantly, failed to take advan
tage of what, in reality, was an
enormous opportunity to think
boldly and imaginatively about
possible futures lor the literary dis
ciplines at Stanford."
Commencement speaker choices
Hennessy's selection of Carly
Fiorina, president and chief ex
ecutive officer of Hewlett-
Packard, as this year's Com
mencement speaker also drew
criticism from students. Perhaps
fueled by Hewlett-Packard's cor
porate ties or, [as some said], be
cause Fiorina was not "inspira
tional" or "famous" enough, the
debate raged on.
"I think that Carly Fiorina was
chosen because of the University's
ties to [Hewlett-Packard| and the
need to maintain their donations
despite Hewlett's recent death,"
senior Krista Glaser said. "What
better way to keep 11P happy with
our University? The Commence
ment speaker is a great prize, and
Stanford gave it to them."
llennessy said he agreed that
there should have been more
communication between the ad
ministration and Senior Class
presidents about the selection
process, but maintained that it is
more challenging than most peo
ple expect.
Some students, when asked,
said they would prefer it if Hen
nessy communicated more with
the student body in general.
"He needs to have a greater
presence in the community," said
one sophomore. "He should Ik*

going to student group meetings,
talking at dining halls and really
interacting with the people here.
"A lot of people generally have
no idea of what llennessy is up
to, and, while that might be the
workings of a humble man, it is
also really annoying because no
one ever has any idea of what ad
ministrative changes will be
made until they are about to be
implemented."
I n response to criticism of Fior
ina's Hewlett-Packard connection,
I lenncssy cited her background in
the humanities. Fiorina majored
in Medieval history and philoso
phy at Stanford.
"I sought, on your hehall and
on behalf of the graduate stu
dents with whom you share this
ceremony, a Commencement
speaker whose accomplishments,
contributions and ability to inllu
ence the world gave him or her a
distinctive point of view from
which to oiler advice about issues
of consequent e," I lennessy wrote
in an e-mail to the Senior Class.
"As has been tradition, we gave
priority to speakers with a Stan
ford connection."
"We have a world-class Com
mencement speaker," I lenncssy
continued.
"She is considered the most
powerful and influential woman
in the business today, and the
technology revolution she helps
drive will influence your genera
tion and those of your children
and grandchildren in ways we can
only imagine."
Medical Center finances
I he issue of financial losses in
the Medical Center has also con
fronted llennessy in his first year.
I he 1997 Balanced Budged Act
has had significant consequences
for academic medical centers
across the nation. According to
Philip Pizzo, the newly appointed
dean of the School of Medicine, fi
nancial problems at Stanford Hos
pitals and Clinics have been partic
ularly significant following the un
successful merger then de-merger
of Stanford with UC-San Francis
co, which officially terminated a
year ago.
"During the past months, [Stan
ford Hospitals and Clinics] has
been working diligently to reduce

these financial losses," Pizzo said.
"Because he has recognized the
importance of the relationship of
[hospitals <»nd clinics], as well as the
Lucille Packard Children's Hospi
tal, to the School of Medicine, Pres
ident Hennessy has assumed an
important leadership role. He has
recognized the problems lacing
academic medical centers are pre
dominantly related to the fact that
payment lot clinical services, by
HMOs, insurance companies and
state and federal programs, are
below their actual cost.
"[Hennessy's] leadership also
extends to entrusting the leaders
of the Medical Center to work
more successfully on beliall of the
future ol the Stanford University
School of Medicine because of its
importance to the future ol chil
dren and adults and because of the
important and integral role it plays
in the University," Pizzo said.
Looking forward
Pizzo is one of several professors
to receive deanships in the past
year under Hennessy, a fact lie
said is significant because it high
lights the relative youth of Hen
nessy's administration.
"The changing landscape of
Stanford itself, both physical and
organizational, rellects tlu- con
stantly evolving nature of the
times. Concerns, complaints and
compliments notwithstanding,
Hennessy's administration is still
in its early stages."
In offering his opinion of what
Stanford embodies, Hennessy
drew upon the Founders' goals
and others that c ame before him.
"David Starr Jordan, speaking
from the West Portal of the Quad
on that opening day 109 years ago,
made this point with eloquence
and simplicity: 'Our university is
hallowed by no traditions,' " 1 len
nessv said during his inauguration
speech Oct. 20, 2000. " It is ham
pered by none. It's linger posts all
point forward.'"
"Happily, in the intervening
years, we have developed many
wonderful traditions." Hennessy
said, "but I am sure you believe, as
I do, that we are still hampered bv
none. Our c hallenges are many,
but our potential is unbounded,
and our linger posts all continue to
point forward."

Around campus, John llen

That Hennessy represents such

<i large part of Stanford to so many
people correlates to the amount <>1
responsibility he carries. In recent
times, a few prominent issues have
tested the strength and integrity of
his leadership.
Acts of intolerance
On the morning of March 20,
white supremacist and anti-Asian
messages were discovered
scrawled with black marker on the
wall of two classrooms in the lane
I listory Corner and a classroom in
Building 50. Ihe racist graffiti
marked the launch of an issue that
would spark c atnpuswide student
protest, administrative response


Stanford News Service
President John Hennessy has faced a number of difficult issues in his first year,
including racist graffiti, controversy over Commencement speaker Carly Fio
rina and the continued loss of revenue by the Medical Center.
and countless dialogue.
Much of that dialogue was io
nised on Hennessy's role in ad
dressing the issue of racist graffiti.
"It [has become evident] just
how quiet Hennessy has been as
president of the University," said
«in April 25 Daily editorial. "One
would think that a crime as offen
sive and harmful as hate graffiti
would elicit a powerful response
from the University, especially the
president. But rather than imme
diately releasing a statement that
strongly condemned such acts of
hate and racism, Hennessy spoke
briefly and then let lower adminis
trators handle the rest... By ne
glecting to take a hard-line ap
proach to these hate crimes, Hen
nessy failed many members of the
Stanford community."
Not so, said Hennessy.
" The (racist graffiti] issue was
kept low-profile because it seems
.is though we are dealing with a
single individual, and, thus, [we]
didn't want to give that individual
the attention [he or she] desired,"
he said. "Being president, you
have to make c alls that [will not be
supported by] everyone in the
University community."
Senior Seiji Yamamoto said he
shared this view.
"Being the president of a uni
versity is a difficult job because of
the unrealistic expectations many
people may have," he said. "It's
easy to forget about John Hen
nessy the human being and only
focus on the duties of his office. It's
true th.it he has the most power of
any one individual to effect
change, but the power we entrust
ed him was not a deification.
"To be honest, I don't think
he's had enough time to really
prove himself, so I'd [prefer] to
postpone judgment fora while.
Now. we currently face a number
of problems, though in my view
they are not attributable to either
[former University President (ier
liard] Casper or Hennessy, but
merely an unfortunate conscience
of factors."
(Xher students said they disagreed.
"Though President Hennessy

might have done some amazing
things this year, the one event that
has tainted [my opinion of him| is
his poor reaction to the hateci lines
on campus,'' said one sophomore.
"I believe that, at any other univer
sity, the president would have real
ly had a strong reaction to such
liate c rimes and would have taken
action immediately.
"Instead, Hennessy delegated
the responsibility to deal with the
hate crimes to lower administra
tors and seemed quite reluctant to
aggressively combat such rac ism.
It makes me sad that the adminis
tration does not feel that the safety
of students of color is a top prioi i
ty here."
"Downsizing" of the humanities?
Other issues have warranted
administrative response this year.
The proposed merger of six de
partments — Asian Languages,
Comparative Literature, Herman
Studies, Slavic Languages and
Literatures and Spanish & Por
tuguese — into the Department
of Languages, (lultures and Liter
atures led many frustrated stu
dents to protest the University
and Hennessy's "downsizing" of
the humanities.
Rush Rehm, an associate pro
fessor of drama and classics, told
the Stanford Report the proposal
was intellectually "vacuous" and
that terms in the proposed plan,
like "strength" and "flexibility,"
were being used for cover.
"There's flexibility in this uni
versity all over the place," Rehm
said. "There's nothing stopping
faculty at this university from get
ting together and doing things
they want. Do we really need to
throw a lot of people together that
don't want to lx- together in order
to develop flexibility?"
In addition to the issue of de
partmentalization, said other fac
ulty members, is concern for re
cruitment in general.
"We have seen our numbers
shrink over the last several years,
with departing faculty members
not always being replaced," Clas
sics Prof. Joshua said. "The
longer key positions remain un
filled, the worse our situation,
since we risk entering a vicious
circle; small numbers of faculty
translates to a small pool of de

pariment graduates, which in
turn 111.1 kc-s ii hard to justify the
recruitment ol new laculty. What
President llennessy could do .11
this point, in my view, is simply to
make funds available lor the re
< 1 uitment ol top scholars — inde
pendently ol the [proposed de
partment merger]."
llennessy said he has made a
promise not to reduce the com
mitment lo the humanities, 111
keeping with Casper's successes
in ili.it area, and that accusations
to the contrary are untrue. Three
hundred million ol the recent
$100 million Hewlett Foundation
gift will go toward funding for the
School ol Humanities and Sci
ences. which has identified needs
totaling more ilian $1 billion.
I he present structure ol
things would not have contributed
to the structure and success of [the
language departments]," llen
nessy said. "The whole goal of the
proposed merger is to strengthen
.uid put more resources into the
humanities, not to [confound] its
identity."
Provost John Ktchemendy said
he agreed, calling the negative
charges leveled at llennessy "un
fair in the extreme."
"The prop<>sal to merge the lan
guage departments was actually
my decision, and John approved
it," Ktchemendy said. " The deci
sion was made not because ol bud
get reasons. Die cheapest thing we
can do is to leave things they way
they are now."
According to Kli/abeth Bern
hardt, director ol the Language
(-enter and a (ierman studies pro
lessor. the proposed department
merger would allow lot a greater,
not smaller, diversity of curricula.
"At present, smaller languages
at Stanford have no academic
home other than in the Special
languages Program," said Bern
hardt, who supports the merger
initiative. "This means that, under
the present structure, we can
never make an academic council
appointment in Hebrew or Arabic
or Swahili. This puts us in a vul
nerable position vis a vis graduate
student interest."
"But, more importantly, this
configuration is simply wrong.
There is substantial interest
around campus in the Middle Kast

and Africa. The literatures and
(ultures of these areas are critical
and yet there is no way fora Stan
lord student to explore these liter

ularly significant following the un
successful merger then de-merger
of Stanford with UC-San Francis
co, which officially terminated a
year ago.
"During the past months, [Stan
ford Hospitals and Clinics] has
been working diligently to reduce

these financial losses," Pizzo said.
"Because he has recognized the
importance of the relationship of
[hospitals <»nd clinics], as well as the
Lucille Packard Children's Hospi
tal, to the School of Medicine, Pres
ident Hennessy has assumed an
important leadership role. He has
recognized the problems lacing
academic medical centers are pre
dominantly related to the fact that
payment lot clinical services, by
HMOs, insurance companies and
state and federal programs, are
below their actual cost.
"[Hennessy's] leadership also
extends to entrusting the leaders
of the Medical Center to work
more successfully on beliall of the
future ol the Stanford University
School of Medicine because of its
importance to the future ol chil
dren and adults and because of the
important and integral role it plays
in the University," Pizzo said.
Looking forward
Pizzo is one of several professors
to receive deanships in the past
year under Hennessy, a fact lie
said is significant because it high
lights the relative youth of Hen
nessy's administration.
"The changing landscape of
Stanford itself, both physical and
organizational, rellects tlu- con
stantly evolving nature of the
times. Concerns, complaints and
compliments notwithstanding,
Hennessy's administration is still
in its early stages."
In offering his opinion of what
Stanford embodies, Hennessy
drew upon the Founders' goals
and others that c ame before him.
"David Starr Jordan, speaking
from the West Portal of the Quad
on that opening day 109 years ago,
made this point with eloquence
and simplicity: 'Our university is
hallowed by no traditions,' " 1 len
nessv said during his inauguration
speech Oct. 20, 2000. " It is ham
pered by none. It's linger posts all
point forward.'"
"Happily, in the intervening
years, we have developed many
wonderful traditions." Hennessy
said, "but I am sure you believe, as
I do, that we are still hampered bv
none. Our c hallenges are many,
but our potential is unbounded,
and our linger posts all continue to
point forward."
