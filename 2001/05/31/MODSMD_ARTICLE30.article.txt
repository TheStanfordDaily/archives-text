### TERRY HURLBUTT 
Ihe Intercollegiate Rowing Association Nation
al Championships is the biggest race in collegiate
rowing, and, when Stanford arrives, it will have
something to prove.
The (Cardinal takes to the water ttxlay through Sat
urday against the top crews in the nation at the IRA re
gatta on ('.ooper River in Cherry Hill, N.J. I'he Pacifit
10 (lonference sends four teams to this event, and this
year's field is highlighted hy undefeated and top
ranked California. No. t> Washington and No. I 1 Ore
gon State will also help represent the West in .1 field still
numerically dominated In Kast (.oast teams. (Collegiate
crew does not boast enough participants to be eligible
as .111 N( IAA sport, making this weekend the culmina
tion of the rowing season.
With two previous IRA titles behind it, Cal is the
clear favorite tins weekend, followed by Kastern
Spi nits < hampion, No. '2 Prim eton. ( Cal brings with it
()lympi( experient e in the form of six ()l\ mpic rowers
.Hid is undefeated to date. (Competition is fieri e among
the top schools, whit b iiu lude No. I Northeastern and
No. 5 lirown. No. 3 Harvard and No. S Yale are the
only two ranked teams that will not Ik- in attendance.
Stanford, in its first year with head coach Craig
Amerklianian, looks to establish itself among the elite
collcgiate < lew programs in the nation.
"We want .1 top-15 finish," Ainerkhanian said, refer
ring to a goal that lias been .1 driving force for the team
all season.
Meeting this goal and making ii to the semifinals
would give Stanford an unprecedented finish at this
event and heighten the (Cardinal's national reputation.
After .1 tumultuous learning season that saw the
Cardinal finish fifth 111 the Pac-10, Stanford is hoping
to see its hard work and dedication pay off big against
the Ik-si (Cherrv I lill has to offer. I he (Cardinal will be
facing its biggest test of the season.
Stanford's last competition was .11 the Pac-MK Cham
pionships three weeks ago in Sacramento, where the
varsity eight brought home a fourth place. I he squad
has spent the interim time preparing its best varsity
eight squad in years for this event. The varsitv eight is
the only competition Stanford will row in during the
course of the weekend. I he squad rat ing this weekend
has demonstrated ext ellence in competition and prac

tiff throughout the season.
Part of the requirement to be in this elite group was
compatibility with the other oarsmen.

"We're g< >ing to w< >rk still nit >reon developing .i bet
ter rhythm together, hopelnlU ing out Ix»:11s a little
more time to mesh together, junior Mario Luis
Ramirez said.
"\\'e want to be satisfied with the performance at
I RAs,"sophomore liryant Helvey said
I he (Cardinal has built .1 competitive squad without
boasting the ()lvmpians and s( holarship athletes that
its peer crews have in their boats. I he season has been
a long one of practice and discipline, and Stanford
looks forward to successful competition against some of
its bij> rivals during the weekend's rac ing.
The ('.ardinal is looking fora better showing against
Oregon State, Stanford's biggest m.il in Pat-10 play.
I he (lardin.il has fallen to the Heavers twice this season,
its last loss in a margin of .1 little more than PJ seconds,
but will have one more chance .ig.unsi the team this
weekend. 1 lie Pac-lOisa major contender in the I RAs,
and Stanford hopes to finish strong alongside its peers.
In addition, the (.ardinal has personal go.ils to beat
during this weekend s racing. After improved start
tiines.it the Pac-10s, Stanford will look to finish its races
strong during the regatta and build momentum to
carry into the next season.
"We're going to woi k on putting 11 .til together fora
full 2k," Ramirez said.
Stanford must be prepared to work hard, as the
weekend will be grueling. I lie regatta tests the cn
diiranc e of its part it ipants, involving heats, re pecluge,
semifinals and finals. I he first two heals will be raced
today, followed bv the semifinals tomorrow and the fi
nals on Saturday. 1 )ctcrmination and discipline will be
important fat tors in figuring whit h crew s move on to
the finals.
The I RAs have been a 111ajor goal of the ('.ardinal all
season long. In a year of rebuilding and occasional
frustration, the IRA regatta is where Stanford hopes to
see its performance fall into plat e. A strong finish here
will give a boost to the squad as it laces summer train
ing in preparation lot the fall rat ing season.
"We just have to put it together," junior Nathan
Schuett said.

as .111 N( IAA sport, making this weekend the culmina
tion of the rowing season.
With two previous IRA titles behind it, Cal is the
clear favorite tins weekend, followed by Kastern
Spi nits < hampion, No. '2 Prim eton. ( Cal brings with it

the top schools, whit b iiu lude No. I Northeastern and
No. 5 lirown. No. 3 Harvard and No. S Yale are the
only two ranked teams that will not Ik- in attendance.
Stanford, in its first year with head coach Craig
Amerklianian, looks to establish itself among the elite
collcgiate < lew programs in the nation.
"We want .1 top-15 finish," Ainerkhanian said, refer
ring to a goal that lias been .1 driving force for the team
all season.
Meeting this goal and making ii to the semifinals
would give Stanford an unprecedented finish at this
event and heighten the (Cardinal's national reputation.
After .1 tumultuous learning season that saw the
Cardinal finish fifth 111 the Pac-10, Stanford is hoping
to see its hard work and dedication pay off big against
the Ik-si (Cherrv I lill has to offer. I he (Cardinal will be
facing its biggest test of the season.
Stanford's last competition was .11 the Pac-MK Cham
pionships three weeks ago in Sacramento, where the
varsity eight brought home a fourth place. I he squad
has spent the interim time preparing its best varsity
eight squad in years for this event. The varsitv eight is
the only competition Stanford will row in during the
course of the weekend. I he squad rat ing this weekend
has demonstrated ext ellence in competition and prac

tiff throughout the season.
Part of the requirement to be in this elite group was
compatibility with the other oarsmen.

"We're g< >ing to w< >rk still nit >reon developing .i bet
ter rhythm together, hopelnlU ing out Ix»:11s a little
more time to mesh together, junior Mario Luis
Ramirez said.
"\\'e want to be satisfied with the performance at
I RAs,"sophomore liryant Helvey said
I he (Cardinal has built .1 competitive squad without
boasting the ()lvmpians and s( holarship athletes that
its peer crews have in their boats. I he season has been
a long one of practice and discipline, and Stanford
looks forward to successful competition against some of
its bij> rivals during the weekend's rac ing.
The ('.ardinal is looking fora better showing against
Oregon State, Stanford's biggest m.il in Pat-10 play.
I he (lardin.il has fallen to the Heavers twice this season,
its last loss in a margin of .1 little more than PJ seconds,
but will have one more chance .ig.unsi the team this
weekend. 1 lie Pac-lOisa major contender in the I RAs,
and Stanford hopes to finish strong alongside its peers.
In addition, the (.ardinal has personal go.ils to beat
during this weekend s racing. After improved start
tiines.it the Pac-10s, Stanford will look to finish its races
strong during the regatta and build momentum to
carry into the next season.
"We're going to woi k on putting 11 .til together fora
full 2k," Ramirez said.
Stanford must be prepared to work hard, as the
weekend will be grueling. I lie regatta tests the cn
diiranc e of its part it ipants, involving heats, re pecluge,
semifinals and finals. I he first two heals will be raced
today, followed bv the semifinals tomorrow and the fi
nals on Saturday. 1 )ctcrmination and discipline will be
important fat tors in figuring whit h crew s move on to
the finals.
The I RAs have been a 111ajor goal of the ('.ardinal all
season long. In a year of rebuilding and occasional
frustration, the IRA regatta is where Stanford hopes to
see its performance fall into plat e. A strong finish here
will give a boost to the squad as it laces summer train
ing in preparation lot the fall rat ing season.
"We just have to put it together," junior Nathan
Schuett said.
