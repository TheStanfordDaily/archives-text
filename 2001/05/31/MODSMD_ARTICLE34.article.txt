Yeah, well, you see Inter
mission? Intermission
was my dream, my wish .
.. and it didn't come true,
so I'm taking it back ...
I'm taking them all back.
So long, and thanks for
all the fish.
â€” Josh and Sarah


CLARIFICATION: As a result of inquiries, the editors of Intermission would like to clarify that 60/40 Breakdown, which was featured
in a story in the May 24 issue of Intermission, did not contribute to the headline or cutline that appeared with the article. This is always
the case with stories that appear in The Stanford Daily.
