Hut, on her new album, "Ayestheni," slu- shows signs of
being spread 100 thin.
It's not that the album is without merit: It's p Ist a typ
ical ( ase of American production overkill. Think of the
fates of such promising voices as (Ihristina Aguilera and
Mariah (larey, and you'll get the idea. I nlike Jennifei
Lopez, whose mediocre voice needed a litde I'ulf to si ll
albums, these women and Atlas sound best unencum
bered by a lot of synth effects.
Much like the late, great Israeli singer Oft a I la/a.
Atlas relies on teeny-boppei pop numbers to get on to
play lists on the radio and in clubs. I laza's voice, though,
retained its power and beauty even in the most trifling
of songs. Atlas, however, sometimes disappears in the
mishmash of faux-exotic beats. It's < lear that she has an
impressive range and tonal color, but she stays in
karaoke range for several songs.
I lie attempt to Americanize Atlas with .1 song with

English lyrics backfires. The much-covered "I Put a
Spell On You" could have been a fantastic recording,
but this smoky-bar siren-song morphs into a forgettable
club mix. It's frustrating to listen to. knowing how much
this song could have shown oil her voice. The scratching
vinyl just sounds plain weird.
On "Maribai," you can hear the influences of
11incli movie music: the fluffy, provocative dance
numbers sung by women. Atlas has fun on this song

and demonstrates some of the technical precision
that makes her music so listenable, like that of Sarah
MacLachlan. Ihe title track is repetitive, though
haunting. But, at this point, the Arabic string
arrangements begin to sound cliche.
"Ashwa" is a welcome relief— .1 song with .1 deep
groove, a simple melody and intriguing percussion.
Again, though, Atlas holds back on iter true abilities,
seemingly joining in to the instruments, rather than
having them support her. "Rah," too, is solid — a story
telling number, hall spoken, hall sung, in both hei
husky lower tones and her high range. For some reason,
ii made me feel patriotic (for North Afric a?!).
But on 'Nc Nle Quitte I'as, it's back to dance-pop
again, with those undying strings and something that's
definitely Arabic but (hat sounds suspiciously like.
"()oh, baby." I'm sure it's a hit in Egypt.
The produc lion work is thankfully more subtle on the
last track. 1 he extra tractions o! a second that she uses to
stretch out hei notes do wonders for hei expression, re
vealing the pristine vibrato and control 1 hat make her
great. At least she doesn't sound like she's running to
catch up with the drum programs, which is just wh.it
happens on the next track. I he song does have .1 high
light, though, in 1 aw flute and oboe solos that mirror the
singer's voice in interesting ways and contrast nic ely with
the slick |)| sound.
Atlas, an alumna of the l'ransglohal Under
ground, has the potential to make an unforgettable
album. I lie less she hides behind the sceurit\ of a
dance-club beat, the more that both new and old fans
will appreciate her talent.
But there is one group of people that should get
its hands on this album .is soon as possible — I)|s.
I lie exotic instruments and vocals are a sampler's
dream come I rue.
