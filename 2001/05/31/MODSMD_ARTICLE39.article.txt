"Subsequence" features cyclic, almost comic al blurps

and features a spunky, plucky Tortoise-like sound that
builds percussive momentum, becoming incrcasinglx
textured and succulent.
"Doit" unfolds as a bouncy, groovalisc ions tec hno

core, frenetic homage to the machine and plays like a su
personic soundtrack to a cyborg mental breakdown.
I"he tangled melodies are interspersed with synthesizer
notes that float on wildly spasmodic electro-rhythms.
Mouse On Mars brazenly attacks the listener with its
inventive brand of syntho-pop. "Idiology" is a brave at
tempt to fuse the acoustic with the sampled, the analog
with the computerized. The album is at times guttural

and raw, but is strangely emotive.
