## MXPX

MXI'X has taken criticism lor a lot of tilings in its
eight-year existence — being too Christian and not
being Christian enough among them, but who would
have thought the band would have to defend its decision
to jump from a major label to an indie one with its latest
release on I- at Wreck Chords?
f'unk I.ins of the traditionally progressive record
label run by N'( )IX Irontmaii Fat Mike were (|iii< k to
crv, "Sellout!" upon bearing that a "(lb list ia 11 band"
bad joined a family of punk bands whose history of
six ially conscions leanings have traditionally exclud
ed ati\ religious inclinations. But. according to the
I'at \\ reck press release, MXPX meets the same c i ite
ria as .ill of the label's other bands: I he\ make great
punk records, have an awesome live show and are
terrific peo pie.

" I"he Renaissance I I' showcases nine new songs — a
selection to tide over its fan base until the next full
length release, lint the record is also lor MXPX a vehi
cle lor the group to stage a pseudo-return to its punk
rock roots.
So what's the result? Mike Hcrrera, bassist and lead
vo( alist lor the band, describes the record as MXPX's in
terpretation of what the band's lirst three records may
have sounded like il they had recorded the songs at the
present time. In his own words, the songs are "some
thing a little bit different, yet actually very similar." I
couldn't put it any better than that.
I lie band's direction on its last album moved toward
the pop side of punk, heavily influenced by Elvis Costel
lo, with the end result being a slower, more produced
feel. ()n the new KP, there is a definite shift in sound th.it
recalls the band's old days — driving and urgent, but
also colored with the melodic polish of its more recent
work. The songs themselves would therefore not sound
out of place on either MXPX's earlier or more recent
records because they blend sonic elements of the band's
entire discography.


Dude, fisheye lenses are so poo-rah.
