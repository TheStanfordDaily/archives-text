When I
mention his ac
tots' respect for
him, Reitman

smiles and savs that
I should thank them il
I see them. Perhaps ()r
-lando |oncs said it best: "1

will be brutally honest: I
think tli.it lie is a genius. And
I've been blessed to work with some

great directors, and he is just an incred

tail. \<>ll can't even imagine it. You'll do a take, and he'll
sa\, "Yom voice vvas too high." And that's a cra/.y note
when you think about it. When I pass this specific point
on to Rcitman — namely, Ins attention to detail — lie
jllst smiles and pauses. "I'll take that as a compliment,
lie says after a lew moments.
\lter we talk about how he got started in the movie
business, I ask liiin something that ends up being the
local point of practically the rest of our conversa

tion. We begin to talk about the action
and rca< tion of the critical evele in

I lie movie business, specifically
about the pressure to pro

duce good material, Icar
ol criticism from re
viewers and how to

neal with those is
sues. Reitman's an
swers are intriguing.
I point out that
lus career has been

augmented In some
vet \ high peaks, such as
"(ihostbusters," and that in

addition man) ol his films
have not been at .ill favorably re

viewed. Mow did he
deal with those pres
sures, and how does
someone in the movie

business deal with them in general?
"I think that most filmmakers run through this
type of minefield," he says."I think for me the hard
est time was after 'Stripes' actually, not after

(Jhostbustei s.' 'Snipes' was the third film
I <1 directed. I d directed a small

movie that was sort ol self fi

this
was like
20 years

ago. That's
like $300 million

today. So it was a very
substantial success.
And, honestly, I was
afraid to direct after
that fora while. It was
two or three years be
fore 1 directed again, and

I guess that was '(•host
busters.' So I didn't want to
wait that lonir after that.

"But, in
terms of
wh at

we're talking
about, I do come
dies, so I've al
most never got
ten good reviews
on any of my
movies, including

'(iliost busters' and
'Stripes,' which are now

considered classics of some
kind. And I think people who
make comedies sort of get
used to not being particu

you have to just learn to

gauge Iroin watching the movie with the audi
ence and hope it works.

leaving his point made without Inrt her art it illation.
I want to touch even more on the issue of critic s,
however, and I -isk him about " Twins." a film that I re
ally liked as .1 child, 1 point out that, with me heinif .1

pecially in 1989) I always

He seems
.11) preciat ive

ol my feelings

about the film.
"Well! (>reat! 1 hat's

one of the movies
that just . . . well.
' I wins' never got
very good re
views. And vet

I've had literally countless people tell me how much
fun that was and what a good movie that is and all
that stufl. And, if you make comedy movies, you just
have to almost use that kind of stuff as a gauge, and
you (an t get yourself nuts on i eviews. You know, re
views are mostly about the avant garde or at least
what is perceived as the avant garde by the reviewer
at that time. And they usually have to do with some
kind of movement.
"And the sort of relatively gentle and optimistic movies
tfiat I have made over the last 20 years have actually been
against the tenure ol the critical times, which have really lo
dised on a cynicism and .1 kind of pessimism and ultra-vio
lence that started with Kubrick and sort ol flowed through
the works of some of our most renowned film directors.

And its tolalK the opposite oi what 1 do, but vou (ant
do what you don't do. So vou just have

to do what is true to your own
sell and hope that, at one

point or another, you
will become in sviu

with t lie (l it it al
times. Because

ol course it's
not eas\ to
take lous\
r e views,
hut you
juM have lo
learn to
live with it."
I' .1 i i

lando | ones

what he thinks
about Kelt 111.111's re

sponse to my question,
and (ones agrees with his di

rector. bin takes it even
.1 step further. "()n the
whole, I think Ivan has
.1 point, loncs said.

I ,1
Hul its even more than ili.it . . . What integi it\ I give
to reviewers, I see slowly eroding away. I mean, they
seem to he wanting to embrace the avail 1 garde, but
then wh\ do they write soundbytes? Ever) time a crit
ic writes a review that has .1 soundbyte like, 'This lilm
is "Men 111 Black" meets " I itanic" ' in the first para
graph ol the review, 11 loses all integrity. 1 lie critic
111,in go 011 to try and provide some anal\sis, but the in
tegi it\ is alread) lost."
So perhaps ii is interesting that, although, as Reit
man claims, reviewei s are interested in and inaiulv sup
portive ol the avant garde, they then so often seem to
write their reviews in a style .is mainstream as most ol
the popcorn" movies they almost never like. Kcitman
would agree with .111 apples-and-oranges metaphor
111.11 holding the kind of "fun" lilins 111.1t he makes to
the s.une line ol critic ism as a serious film is Hawed. Al
though I am still a little skeptical, I think to a fair de
gree 1 see his point.

As we get up to leave, he smiles and savs it was a pleasure

talking with me. I say the

door. As I leave, I
