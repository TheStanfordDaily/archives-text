I .1111 not ,i violent person, nor would I describe myself as having more than the

hewing lot some gruesome Kaniika/e < ai nage to interrupt the !i7th consecutive
"Kodak moment' we the audience were forced to
sit through.

Before breaking into the mnltiimllioii dollai
movie m.irket, directoi Michael Bay got his start di
reeling TV commercials and music videos. Keep this
in mind while vou're watching a certain love scene in

You like u rough, don't you? Von like having your nipples c lamped and your buttocks
whipped. Yeah, von know you do. You pant with anticipation at the very thought of re
ceiving an erotic ,ill\ tinged love spank. Your pain is your pleasure, and I'earl I larhor
is your favorite new movie.
I he lilm, wliic li opened last weekend to inedioc re box office returns, is ripe from the
c inematic loins ol mega-producer |err\ Bruckenheimer and director Michael Bay and
is, to pni it inildh . moderately painlul to watch. But some ol us like it rough.

II lines like, "If I had one more night
to live, I'd want to spend it with you," or,
"I'll love you m\ whole life," don't make
you retch, then you're sweet. Granted, a
sweeping war-era romance, such as that
in "IVarl Harbor," with a grand, histori
cally .significant battle .is abac kdrop, has
immense sex appeal — if it's done right.
I lowever, the love triangle, played up
as the centerpiece of the film and played
out In Ben Alllcc k, Kate Bee kinsale and
Josh I lartiiett, was sexuali/ed, but far from
sexv. Although screenwriter Randall Wal
lace undoubtedly intended to make the
threesome's romantic exploits a
grandiose affair, such a vision failed to
materialize and the wanton lust story in
stead becomes trite and trivialized.
So with the heart ol the story gasping
for air, what's left are the action se
quences. And, yes, they do deliver — in
grand, cinematographically gluttonous
fashion. Amazing shots that follow torpe
dos as the\ plunge toward Tinted States

desirovei sin ihi' harbor from tlie* bellies of |apanese bombers are plenty and ingra
tiate themselves with the most disi erning action movie bull.
'Tearl Harbor" is light on character development, but heavy on magnificent action
splendot. So il agom is \<>ut e< stas\. then toss yont anchor at "Tearl I larbor" . . . and
save me some i andle wax — bet anse I like it when it burns.
