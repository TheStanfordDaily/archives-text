# Merchant and Ivory deliver more of same with 'Golden Bowl'
## 
### RANDY MANO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I hi* early '90s trend to produce ls
mail Mck li.iiii |atnes Ivory period films
like "The Remains of the Dav" and
"Howards Fnd" never really floati'il my
boat. I usually found films in th.it artsy
genre very bloated and stully, and they
rarely challenged the viewer to think
outside the box. With "The Golden
Howl," we are once again presented
with a worldly affair that takes plate in
Italy, Kngland and the United States.
First, however, let's start with the
good st 1111. I lie cast, for example, has
had its moments of glory. Uma I hur
man rocked the movie world with her

stunning ovcidose
in "Pulp Fiction."
Niik Nolte has
i nci c<l critical
acclaim (or his
roles in "Flu*
Prince of Fides"
and "Affliction."
And you'll proba
bly remember An
jelica Huston
showcasing her
darker elements

in"The Aildams Family" series and
"Fver After."
Likewise, the source for this movie is
solid: the novel of the same name by
Henry |ames. The story is driven by

characters who are forced to lie to and
deceive then t losest companions.
Km, unlike the flaw in the titular
bowl, which plays into the storyline and
is difficult to discern unless viewed
closeh, it's c.isv to point out the flaws in
iliin film. I he.it loi s have been horribly
miscast. Finn man cannot handle the
mood swings and grandiose love th.it
her character, (iharlotte, is supposed to
exhibit. Kate lieckinsale (the "Pearl
Harbor" love interest) comes across .is
creepy and abrasive as Maggie, the Flec
tra complex-ridden daughter of Ameri
can billionaire Adam Vcrver. Lastly, |e
remy North.un, as Charlotte's love in
terest and Maggie's husband, has no
reason to sport his faux Italian accent in

anv flitiirt* films.
Similarly, the premise — tli.it two
lovers many a lather and daughter in
order to remain dose to one another —
doesn't really flesh out its implications
until the movie is nearly over. The ten
sion-lilled buildup to the climax of the
film leels forced and tedious — a trade
mark <>112 other Merchant-Ivory produc
tions.
I here are much better ways to spend
your time if you decide to brave the
movie theaters in the near future. C '.heck
out "I he (folden Bowl" if you haven't
already seen "Memento" and"A
Knight's Tale."


My cup runneth over.
