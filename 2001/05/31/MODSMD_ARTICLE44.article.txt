Disney's latest lull length animated fea
ture, "Atlantis," opens |nne 15. Ihe film
was produced In I)on I lalin and direi led
bv (lar) I'rousdale and Kirk Wise. Koi
yon Disney aficionados, that would he the
producing / directing team behind Dis
nev's well received I '.Mil animated fea
ture, "Beant\ and the Beast."
I lit- film is startlingh different
from all ol the Disney animated fea
tures I've seen before â€” a number I'll
keep to myself, though I'll admit it's in
double digits. I ley, I have a younger
sister, allright? Foi one thing, it's
much faster. (>ar\ Trousdale's work

I lie film is, according to
Disnev, an attempt to revisit
the adventure-oriented spir
it of such early films as "2(5,00
Leagues I nderthe Sea" and
"Swiss Katnih Robinson."

As with an\ Disney animated lea
lure. the place where "Atlantis" reall\
shines is in the artwork itself. I he an
imation is lush, detailed and engross
ing. I lie animators used a combina
tion ol hand-drawn artwork and < oin
putcr animation to create "Atlantis \s"
dense visual atmosphere. I be "tain

throughout the lilm, nimblv shifting
the audience's pcrspct tive around the

makes the movie feel a bit like an

I Ins movie is a lot like a I lostess

eating it . . . as long as you don't think
