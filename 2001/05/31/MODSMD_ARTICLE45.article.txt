I lic i t- art' times .it the movies
when I absoluteb smile with plea
sure. When (he storyline and the
performances lit perlectK togeth
er. When every scene brings me
j<>\. When I feel so good and so
happy, I just want to hug the
screen and hold the characters
tight, Dial's what going to the
movies is all about.
And, then, there are those other
times. When a movie sinks undei a
mot ass of stupidity. When the dia
logue sounds like it was written In
.1 robot. When nothing clicks,
nothing works and nothing seems
to lit together. When m\ hope for
the human race gets lost in a bag of
buttered popcorn.
Movies — both the good and
the bad ones are strong experi-

ences. So strongly that most peo
ple often forget that the characters
on the s( reen are onl\ < harac ters.
We lose ourselves in the larger
than-life, 70-foot screen. We drift
into new worlds and leave out
worries behind. We have traveled
alongside Helen limit and
Michael Douglasand |ulia Roberts

bombs like "I'earl Harbor' at
tacking theaters even week,
then it is my job, ni\ dutv, to
make the planet a sale place for
movie-lovers everywhere.
It's a strange world we live in,
where a green ogre outwits and
outshines Hen Alllei k — but there
vou have it.
