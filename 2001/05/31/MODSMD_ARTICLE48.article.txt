# Terri Clark brings Canadian country music to Fillmore
## 
### JACKIE SKAPIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Any innocent bystanders who
happened to be in the neighbor
hood ol the San Francisco Fill
nlore on May 23 were probably a
little taken aback by the number
of cowboy hats, pick-up trucks
and skin-tight Levis they en
countered outside the concert
hall. Not to mention the large
purple airbrushed tour bus
p.irked across the street.
Ii might have seemed perfect
l\ reasonable to assume that the
source of the cultural invasion
had come straight from the heart
of Nashville, but that guess
would not have been completely
,i< ( urate. Although she < un ently
resides in the countr\ music
inecca ol Tennessee, the woman
whose western drawl and black
cowboy hat brought San Francis
co's die-hard country music fans
out <>i hiding on a windy
Wednesday night was (Canadian
sensation Terri ('.lark.
I he Fillmore, which bears the
intimate distinction of having a
large wooden dance lloor instead

ol more tradiiion.il concert-st\lc
seating, is the pet lec t loc ale for .1
pel former who wants to keep ilic
lans on their feet. Clark began
the show In keeping fans waiting

for the better
part of an hour.
"Who does she
think she is? Reha?"
1 heard one slight 1\
intoxicated middle
aged man beside me
whine aftei waiting
for minutes.
With nothing to
do but make re
turn trips to the
bar at the !>ac k of
the dance flooi. the
crowd was starting
to get a little boi ed,
.1 little drunk and a
little restless. But
when Clark came
out on stage, the
e\( ited applause
that greeted her
was genuine, ancl
the boots and
hollers from lonek
cowboys were en
thusiast i( With

her signature black cowboy hat
tilted low ovei be 1 eves and her
country western growl in high
gear, Clark thrilled the crowd
with a rollicking rendition ol

I if i hit, " I motion,i! C.irl," to
Sl.ll l tilings oil.
Alter several enthusiastic and
energetu numbers in her open
ing set and ,i sincere promise
tli.il S.in Francisco v\as one ol
her favorite cities, ('.lark had
charmcd the audience into lot
giving het tardiness. IU the time
she got to recent hits "I'oor, Poor
Pitllnl Me .ind " A Little (i.iso
linc, the noise ol the t rowd was
deafening and the fickle Reha
I.m heside me was olfering ( Hark
Ins cowbo\ li.it as a token ol his
deep allei tion.
Throughout hei set, (Hark
played like a perldriner who
triiK feels a ( onnet t ion with
hei I.ins. She was .ill ovei the
stage, she jainmed with her
lead gnitat ist pla\ 112 1111 \. in a
(1 iins'n Roses style parody,
and slapped high fives with
fans. She proved that, even
though she max not have heen
horn in Nashville, she still gen
nineh loves being a countrs
music star.
Hill the ( oik ert was not with
out its rough spots. I here was
the matter ol her crowd banter.

which included <i lot <>l puzzling
stories about her Canadian
grandmother that rambled aim
lc-ssly. There was also the mattei
of her band — a motley civ\\ of
musicians whose thinb veiled
discomlbrt was as apparent .is
('.lark's easy < onlidence. It didn't
help tli.it the lead gnit.ti i>t
looked exactly like Frankenstein «■
And last, but not least, there was
the"( Canada factor."
( .111,1(1,1 and countr\ music
are not two things we can itntne
diateh accept as compatible,
and, in spite ol her cowbo\ hat
and hei ton (idem swagger, there
was something a little too pol
isheel about (Hark to accept bet
as a plain old country girl. I lie
wa\ l u-1 tasteful, expensive silvci
watc li glittered in the stage lights
and the ('.anadian vowels (absent
in hei songs) snuck back into hei "
speech as she (halted with the
(loud detracted from her
as a true country diva.
I erri ('.lark is a talented singei
songwriter with an impressive
voii'e and an enthusiastic stage
presence, but let's face it. She's
not Kcha.


What chord is that she's playing? I just can't tell
