# Bangkok Cuisine: Meat impersonators appearing daily
## 
### NEGAR AZIMI BLAIR TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
When you're in need of a quirk I hai
li\. Bangkok (iuisine will do you right. It's
fast, it's cheap and it tastes excellent. As
was the case with our review of Sue's In
dian (iuisine ((Hastro Street), we will .idniii
to being biased in our selection of the
restaurant in question. We eat here a lot
- but there's good reason for our consis
tent patronage.
Demurely situated on Palo Alto's I Alton
Avenue, just parallel to bustling Llniversi
tv, Bangkok Cuisine is an inviting nook,
though certainly not easy to spot. Look for
the little white Christinas lights strung
above the door — but be sure not to con
fuse it with the equally Christinas-lit |anta
(mediocre Indian up the street) and cer
tainly not with white collar Spago (though
it might be fun to go in there and demand
(Irab Balls or Son-In-Law Tofu).
Anyway, once inside, we reckon you
won't have to wait long to be seated at one
<>112 Bangkok's cozy tables. I hey have a re
markable turn-around rate.

We always get the same thing. Some
times we tease one anothei. daring to step
outside <>l habit, but it is always with the
subtextual knowledge that we'll end up
with our old-reliables: hangkok < hickcn
and spicy eggplant (slaves to its purple
sheen that we are) with simulated meat.
We should address the simulated meat; it
is white and soft and we think it aims to
simulate chic ken, but we prefer to consid
er it its own independent food group, li ee
from the manacles of conformist, ha< k
ward, Orwellian nutritional notions. What
is "meat" anyway?
But we digress. Bangkok chicken is re
ally more of a vegetable medley that com
bines baby corn, carrots, green peppers,
pecans, black mushrooms, crispy fried
noodles and, yes, chicken strips, all en
veloped in a honey sauce (with heavy
ketchup hues). Looking at that descrip
tion, we realize it seems grotesque (al
most degoutant), but it is really a lovely
dinner option.
Returning to dear aubergine, it is key to
note that the "spicy" in spicy eggplant
must not be ignored. I he chili flakes pack
a wallop, .ill right. But the sweet I hai basil

and soy beans help balance the flavor so
that your tastebuds are in fact able to do
tlu ir job. I he sance saturates the eggplant
such that it becomes dclightfulh iniisln
and dense — the perfect compliment to
your sticky steamed rice.
()ther dishes we've come dangerous
ly close to ordering include the ginger
chicken (sauteed chicken with ginger,
mushrooms, onions and green pep
pers), the steamed combination seafood
curry (prawns, squid, rock cod, mussels,
bamboo shoots, green beans, zucchini,
baby corn, galingale, sweet basil and red
curry) and I hai Muslim curry, alias
Mus-Sa-Mun, (tender beef accompa
nied by carrots, potatoes, carrot,
pineapple and coconut milk).
()n the occasion that we find ourselves
willing and able to step outside the usual
$ 12 per-person budget, we indulge in one
of Bangkok's detent wines (rarely over
stepping the $20 boundary). Desserts are
available, though we've never had room to
< ram them in. I fad we the willpower not to
stuff ourselves senseless, we might be
tempted by the Bangkok ice ( team (home
made ice cream in the exquisite and exotic

flavor ol jackfruit). ()i the deep fried ba
nana. Or, alternatively, the deep fried ba
nana with ice cream (with (lie incredible
savings of $ 1.05 upon consolidation).
So there's not much more to sav about
Bangkok (luisine. I he wait staff has nevei
mistreated us (although we recommend
you do take pains to clearly annunciate
your dinner selection, as we have been
misunderstood Irotn time to time — a mis
take always hospitably corrected). I lie
eggplant has never failed us. And the bill
has never rendered us shocked or embit
tered. The last item of note is that
Bangkok Cuisine has three sister restau
rants. two of which are (in a bizarre real es
tate strategy) located next-door to one an
other on the Asian s< lunorgesboard that is
('.astro Street.
I hese are good people cooking good
lood at honest prices. Next time you crave
something more intricate than a burger,
but not so much pricier, get yourself to.

()n the occasion that we find ourselves
willing and able to step outside the usual
$ 12 per-person budget, we indulge in one
of Bangkok's detent wines (rarely over
stepping the $20 boundary). Desserts are
available, though we've never had room to
< ram them in. I fad we the willpower not to
stuff ourselves senseless, we might be
tempted by the Bangkok ice ( team (home
made ice cream in the exquisite and exotic

flavor ol jackfruit). ()i the deep fried ba
nana. Or, alternatively, the deep fried ba
nana with ice cream (with (lie incredible
savings of $ 1.05 upon consolidation).
So there's not much more to sav about
Bangkok (luisine. I he wait staff has nevei
mistreated us (although we recommend
you do take pains to clearly annunciate
your dinner selection, as we have been
misunderstood Irotn time to time — a mis
take always hospitably corrected). I lie
eggplant has never failed us. And the bill
has never rendered us shocked or embit
tered. The last item of note is that
Bangkok Cuisine has three sister restau
rants. two of which are (in a bizarre real es
tate strategy) located next-door to one an
other on the Asian s< lunorgesboard that is
('.astro Street.
I hese are good people cooking good
lood at honest prices. Next time you crave
something more intricate than a burger,
but not so much pricier, get yourself to.
Bangkok.
