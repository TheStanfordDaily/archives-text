# Professor inspires future filmmakers

It was a simple twist of fate:
After receiving an undergraduate
degree in political science, kris
tine Satnuelson decided not to go
to law school.
I let defense?
The movies made her do it.
"I had always been interested
in the fine arts," said Satnuelson,
who balances her dual roles as a
Stanford professor and the chair
person of the Communication De
partment.
Born and raised in Seattle,
Samuelson, known as" Ki is" by her
students, completed her under
graduate work at UCLA and ar
rived at Stanford as a graduate stu
dent in documentary filmmaking.
"I got my degree with a special
ty in film and TV — that program
still exists here today, she said.
Leaving the Farm with a knack
for telling stories, Satnuelson was
ready to lut the big screen, but not
in the way that most Hollywood
hopefuls imagine.
"I didn't enjoy the feature film
business," she said.
Instead, Satnuelson said she
wanted to focus on the human as
pect of filmmaking. And she land
ed in the documentary business
with a splash.
Satnuelson was honored in

1975 with recognition that most
industry insiders hope for their
entire lives. I let short-subject doc
umentary, "Arthur and Lilly,"
which she directed and co-pro
duced, went on to receive an
Academy Award nomination.
"It was an overwhelming and
thrilling experience," Satnuelson
said of her big night at Holly
wood's most esteemed annual
event.
Although she didn't lake the
golden statuette home — the
award went to a film with a much
larger budget — Satnuelson bla/.ed
a name for herself in the world of
documentary filmmaking.
For the next six years, she spent
her time working on various pro
jects, including the film "An Artists
Journey," which traces the life of
Alaskan artist Fred Machetanz.
Then in 1982, she accepted a job
as a visiting professor at Stanford.
The rest, as they say in the world
of hackneyed film dialogue, is his
tory.
Satnuelson now teaches the
majority of her classes in the same
program that she was enrolled in
as a graduate student. Both her
careers — as filmmaker and as in
structor — she suggested, go hand
in hand.
"I just fell in love with this life,"
