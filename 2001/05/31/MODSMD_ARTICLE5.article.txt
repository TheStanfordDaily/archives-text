# Professor inspires future filmmakers

It was a simple twist of fate:
After receiving an undergraduate
degree in political science, kris
tine Satnuelson decided not to go
to law school.
I let defense?
The movies made her do it.
"I had always been interested
in the fine arts," said Satnuelson,
who balances her dual roles as a
Stanford professor and the chair
person of the Communication De
partment.
Born and raised in Seattle,
Samuelson, known as" Ki is" by her
students, completed her under
graduate work at UCLA and ar
rived at Stanford as a graduate stu
dent in documentary filmmaking.
"I got my degree with a special
ty in film and TV — that program
still exists here today, she said.
Leaving the Farm with a knack
for telling stories, Satnuelson was
ready to lut the big screen, but not
in the way that most Hollywood
hopefuls imagine.
"I didn't enjoy the feature film
business," she said.
Instead, Satnuelson said she
wanted to focus on the human as
pect of filmmaking. And she land
ed in the documentary business
with a splash.
Satnuelson was honored in

1975 with recognition that most
industry insiders hope for their
entire lives. I let short-subject doc
umentary, "Arthur and Lilly,"
which she directed and co-pro
duced, went on to receive an
Academy Award nomination.
"It was an overwhelming and
thrilling experience," Satnuelson
said of her big night at Holly
wood's most esteemed annual
event.
Although she didn't lake the
golden statuette home — the
award went to a film with a much
larger budget — Satnuelson bla/.ed
a name for herself in the world of
documentary filmmaking.
For the next six years, she spent
her time working on various pro
jects, including the film "An Artists
Journey," which traces the life of
Alaskan artist Fred Machetanz.
Then in 1982, she accepted a job
as a visiting professor at Stanford.
The rest, as they say in the world
of hackneyed film dialogue, is his
tory.
Satnuelson now teaches the
majority of her classes in the same
program that she was enrolled in
as a graduate student. Both her
careers — as filmmaker and as in
structor — she suggested, go hand
in hand.
"I just fell in love with this life,"
she said. "You could keep learn
ing through your students."
While she teaches mostly grad
uate students, Samuelson also
tries to cross the bridge into un
dergraduate territory.
I would like to involve un
dergraduates in more media,"
she said.
Some of her past classes, for
both graduate and undergradu
ate students, include "Introduc
tion to Film and Video," "The
Documentary Eye" and "Media
Narratives."
And Samuelson's flirtation with
the Academy isn't over yet. Many
of her students throughout the
years have been honored at the
Student Academy Awards, a
recognition awarded by the Ac ad
emy to beginning filmmakers.
"Stanford has more [students
who receive] Academy Awards
than any other film school our
size," she said.
Graduate students Porter
Gale and Laleh Soomekh were
the two most recent winners.
I hey will be honored at a formal
awards ceremony for their work
on the film "XXXY," which tells
the story of several transgen
dered hermaphrodites.
"Prof. Samuelson helped us
produce this film by encourag
ing Laleh and me make films
that not only inspired and c hal
lenged us as filmmakers, but
also the intended audiences,"
Gale said. "With this particular
piece, we did have some nega
tive feedback at the conceptual
stage, but the process at Stan
ford allowed us move forward
and produce the film that we
felt needed to be made."
Soomekh, who will be graduat
ing in June, said she agreed.
"From the get go, Kris brings .1
high level of professionalism to
our educational experience. She

holds a high bar, while guiding
and encouraging us toward our
highest potentials. She has so
much experience and informa
tion to share; 1 never waul to miss
her class."
Karen Ix'fcourt.a graduate stu
dent in the Communication De
partment who is enrolled in film
classes, also praised Samuelson's
assets as an instructor.
"Kris is an insightful, thor
ough and dedicated professor,"
Lefcourt said. "She is able to
meet you where you are at in
your filmmaking process, which
results in truly helpful advising
and teaching."
Students aren't the only ones
who recognized Samuelson for
her talents. "She brings a deep
and practical knowledge of her
subject, enthusiasm, empathy
with students and a love ol the
medium," Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose, who teaches film
classes, said.
Breitrose noted that he had a
special relationship with Samuel
son. Not only is she his colleague,
but she is also one of his former
students.
"I've never co-taught a class
with her, but she was my student
and is now my department chair,"
he said. "In both roles, she influ
enced me totreat students with re
spect lor their abilities and to hold
them to the high standards th.it
they deserve."
In addition to these talents,
Samuelson is also known among
faculty and students as an educa
tor and a supporter. Thomas
Burns, graduate student in the
Communication Department,
said he admires Samuelson's cre
ative touch and inspiration.
"Kris possesses the ama/ing
ability to keep the whole produc
tion process in perspective," lie
said. "Even in the deepest, darkest
hours of creative strife, when the
film is a monster you can't control.
Kris will make a comment that re
minds you that there is a light at
the end of the tunnel."

jects, including the film "An Artists
Journey," which traces the life of
Alaskan artist Fred Machetanz.
Then in 1982, she accepted a job
as a visiting professor at Stanford.
The rest, as they say in the world
of hackneyed film dialogue, is his
tory.
Satnuelson now teaches the
majority of her classes in the same
program that she was enrolled in
as a graduate student. Both her
careers — as filmmaker and as in
structor — she suggested, go hand
in hand.
"I just fell in love with this life,"
she said. "You could keep learn
ing through your students."
While she teaches mostly grad
uate students, Samuelson also
tries to cross the bridge into un
dergraduate territory.
I would like to involve un
dergraduates in more media,"
she said.
Some of her past classes, for
both graduate and undergradu
ate students, include "Introduc
tion to Film and Video," "The
Documentary Eye" and "Media
Narratives."
And Samuelson's flirtation with
the Academy isn't over yet. Many
of her students throughout the
years have been honored at the
Student Academy Awards, a
recognition awarded by the Ac ad
emy to beginning filmmakers.
"Stanford has more [students
who receive] Academy Awards
than any other film school our
size," she said.
Graduate students Porter
Gale and Laleh Soomekh were
the two most recent winners.
I hey will be honored at a formal
awards ceremony for their work
on the film "XXXY," which tells
the story of several transgen
dered hermaphrodites.
"Prof. Samuelson helped us
produce this film by encourag
ing Laleh and me make films
that not only inspired and c hal
lenged us as filmmakers, but
also the intended audiences,"
Gale said. "With this particular
piece, we did have some nega
tive feedback at the conceptual
stage, but the process at Stan
ford allowed us move forward
and produce the film that we
felt needed to be made."
Soomekh, who will be graduat
ing in June, said she agreed.
"From the get go, Kris brings .1
high level of professionalism to
our educational experience. She

holds a high bar, while guiding
and encouraging us toward our
highest potentials. She has so
much experience and informa
tion to share; 1 never waul to miss
her class."
Karen Ix'fcourt.a graduate stu
dent in the Communication De
partment who is enrolled in film
classes, also praised Samuelson's
assets as an instructor.
"Kris is an insightful, thor
ough and dedicated professor,"
Lefcourt said. "She is able to
meet you where you are at in
your filmmaking process, which
results in truly helpful advising
and teaching."
Students aren't the only ones
who recognized Samuelson for
her talents. "She brings a deep
and practical knowledge of her
subject, enthusiasm, empathy
with students and a love ol the
medium," Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose, who teaches film
classes, said.
Breitrose noted that he had a
special relationship with Samuel
son. Not only is she his colleague,
but she is also one of his former
students.
"I've never co-taught a class
with her, but she was my student
and is now my department chair,"
he said. "In both roles, she influ
enced me totreat students with re
spect lor their abilities and to hold
them to the high standards th.it
they deserve."
In addition to these talents,
Samuelson is also known among
faculty and students as an educa
tor and a supporter. Thomas
Burns, graduate student in the
Communication Department,
said he admires Samuelson's cre
ative touch and inspiration.
"Kris possesses the ama/ing
ability to keep the whole produc
tion process in perspective," lie
said. "Even in the deepest, darkest
hours of creative strife, when the
film is a monster you can't control.
Kris will make a comment that re
minds you that there is a light at
the end of the tunnel."
It was a simple twist of fate:
After receiving an undergraduate
degree in political science, kris
tine Satnuelson decided not to go
to law school.
I let defense?
The movies made her do it.
"I had always been interested
in the fine arts," said Satnuelson,
who balances her dual roles as a
Stanford professor and the chair
person of the Communication De
partment.
Born and raised in Seattle,
Samuelson, known as" Ki is" by her
students, completed her under
graduate work at UCLA and ar
rived at Stanford as a graduate stu
dent in documentary filmmaking.
"I got my degree with a special
ty in film and TV — that program
still exists here today, she said.
Leaving the Farm with a knack
for telling stories, Satnuelson was
ready to lut the big screen, but not
in the way that most Hollywood
hopefuls imagine.
"I didn't enjoy the feature film
business," she said.
Instead, Satnuelson said she
wanted to focus on the human as
pect of filmmaking. And she land
ed in the documentary business
with a splash.
Satnuelson was honored in

1975 with recognition that most
industry insiders hope for their
entire lives. I let short-subject doc
umentary, "Arthur and Lilly,"
which she directed and co-pro
duced, went on to receive an
Academy Award nomination.
"It was an overwhelming and
thrilling experience," Satnuelson
said of her big night at Holly
wood's most esteemed annual
event.
Although she didn't lake the
golden statuette home — the
award went to a film with a much
larger budget — Satnuelson bla/.ed
a name for herself in the world of
documentary filmmaking.
For the next six years, she spent
her time working on various pro
jects, including the film "An Artists
Journey," which traces the life of
Alaskan artist Fred Machetanz.
