### ROXY SASS SOME SORT OF GURU 
Question: Dear Roxy Sass,
1 t ead youi column a couple of weeks ago when you talked about spooning and presently I find myself in a spooning dilemma. 1 here's this girl who 1 kind of
like, and we've heen hanging out a lot. Recently, we've been doing some serious spooning, but every time 1 try to move to actual sex, 1 get shut down. What s going
on? Is slit' ever going to put out? Is there anything I can do?
Signed,

Answer: Dear Bow-Legged,
I s\ in pat hi/e wit h your dilemma. Sin ha sit nat ion often occurs on college campuses and actually thins the herd ol gc >dless atheists who dominate liberal edu-

cation. I low? Well, I hose in your situation often become con
vim ed that the hand ol (iod does exist and is reac lung down
to s(|uee/.e the delicate spong\ t issues of t heii net her regions.
Here's what voii need to know about the spooning
nigh I mare. You i nonc-too-u nicpic sit nation is t he result ol
one ol two culprits, and the distinction, as in 1 ibet.au Bud
dhism, is all a mallei of sell-awareness. If she is aware of
the tornlent she is doling out, she is what those of us in the
know c all a"( aiddle Whore," one who subsists on human
misera and pain. You can neither i hange nor convert her,
and, no matter how erudite and charming you think your
self, to her, you are one more nameless, throbbing niein
bei to add to her trophy case. When she's finished with
sou, she ill go back to her otliei hobbies: reading serial
killei biographies (for tips), stalking liei next pre\ and
bikini waxing chipmunks.
On I he other hand, il t lie c real ure you have engaged is in
nocentl\ cuddling and blissfully unaware of your desperate
ly pleading tumescence, you have chanced upon the "Cud
dle Shu" in her natural environment. I hough she may leave
a bobbing sea of blue balls m her wake, you cannot fault her,
as she is only ac ting on instinct, much like a scorpion or a
li/.ard. You can't blame a li/arcl for not having sex with you:
It's jiist instinct.
Once vou are sure that the girl vou have /eroed in on
is a Cuddle Slut, you must proceed with care, as she can
be as fickle- as |im Jeffords. (If you're reading, Jim, call
me). I\u laying this spooning behavior into sex is actually
a ver\ delic ate process which I will attempt to elucidate
fort ft with.
On the diagram to the light, you will find the Cuddle
( an ve. I inie is plotted along the X-axis and likelihood of sex
on the Y-axis. I he first night of innocent cuddling is really
the prime chance for the cuddle conversion. As the skv be
gins to gray in tlu- east and you wrap up your lengthy and
meaningful conversation on the significance of.. . whatever,
you nuisi surreptitiously whip out your last carefully stashed
breath mint and muster the blue cojones to lean in for the
cuddle concluding kiss. Goodbye, Spoontown. Hello,
Sporkville, population three (her. \ou and your happy little
love-weasel).
Unfortunately, you have missed this launch window (A).
As you have discovered, in the second (B) and third (C) cud
dle episodes, respectively, you become less and less likely to
accomplish your assigned niission(ary). You have, unfortu
nately, entered the Plato trie Bowl (D). Your cuddle time con
versations have become deep, emotional exchanges and are
therefore useless. With each new cuddle encounter, you are
becoming more friend-like and safe, and less .in object of
lust. I he worst result this can lead to is illustrated at point K,
where you fall into the Just Friends chasm. It is difficult
nay, impossible — to claw your way out of this mantrap.

I lie best way to negotiate this hurdle is to spring lor the "accidental" erogenous /.one contact (F). This could even be under the guise of sleep, so that when you
"wake np,' your hands are strategic ally placed. Depending on the reaction you receive. < limb your way up the other side of the curve to "planned but unthreat
ening" touching ((«) and then to "straight-up fondling" (II). II you don't negotiate this in the proper time frame, you are vulnerable to plunging into the Likc-A-
Brother Abyss (1), which means continued contact is unlikely, unless she hails from West Virginia.
(iodspecd to you. And, remember, though 1 try to paint a pretty little face on it, it's .til just a miserable fumbling meat. So enjoy!
Yours,
Ho.xx Snss
