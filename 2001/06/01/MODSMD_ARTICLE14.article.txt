### TIANA DESKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new Web site, negotiation.parc.xerox
.coni/weblO/index.html, sketches the "Stan
lord S<H.'ial \\ el> by deducing; the connections
between people from the information con
tained on their Web sites. I he Web site was de
veloped b\ Latla Adantif, an applied physics
graduate student at Stanford, and Kytan Adar,
who works .it the Hewlett-Packard Sand Hill
Labs. I heir researc !i u.is suppoi ted I»\ the In
ternet Kcologies Area ol the \ero\ Palo Alto
Research ('enter.
According to Atlantic and Adar's research
proposal, "the links and text on .1 user's home
page .ind the mailing lists the iisei subscribes to
are reflections ol social interactions a user has in
the real world. I bus. In scan hing the Web
sites of Stanford students for matching text and
analyzing the links between Stanford students'
pages, 11 is possible to recogni/e pail s of friends
or acquaintances.
"Our research tends to cross the lines be
tween physics, computet science, ctonomics

and even social science research,'" said the de
velopers ol the Stanford Social Web in a state
ment. "We had been fascinated by the six de
grees ol separation' concept that any two peo
ple in 11 it- world can be linked through onlv a
small chain ol acquaintances, and we lountl this
true of personal homepages."
Provided that people's friends have Web
sites hosted by a Stanford server, the Stanford
Social Wei) can provide an intriguing sketch of
their social lives. Alter entering a Stanford sys
tem user name onto the main Web site, one is
led to a page showing a diagram <>1 one's Irientls
mapped tun 111 the form of a constellation. I he
links between friends are inferred from the pat
tern of in-links and out-links that connet 1 their
Web sites.
I he Stanford Social Web not onl\ indicates
existing ties between students, but suggests
pairs of students who share common experi
ences 01 interests, regardless of whether they
are already acquainted with each other. I he
text on students' Web sites is compared \\iili
in categories such as "cities," "persons" and
"organizations," 111 order to generate a "like

ness score.
"We lliink it's ven useful tool lor re
start hers who seek it> understand how social
networks form," said Ad.unit and Adar in a
statement. " I he Internet provides a significant
data source that allows for studies on a scale
never belore possible."
Considering future commercial applica
tions ol the let hnology, they said, "1 here are
(>1 course potential marketing applications for
such a tool, hut these would require many
more improvements in both the data acquisi
tion analysis tools." As sin h, tlie\ said they
have no current plans lor a commercial ver
sion oi the software.
I he Stanford Social Web site has draw n crit
icism from some students, int hiding the group
Concerned Students At Stanford. "It describes
student relationships extending as far as I As.
We feel it is very inappropriate that such infor
mation should be released and lintl mm hofthe
information on rating 11 it* likeness of people to
be 1.115e." the group argues in a statment.
"All data gathered was data that
individuals chose to make public l\
available on the Internet. It is un
realistic to expect that the informa
tion on a public Web page be pri
vate," the sites developers said.

I hev said they viewed the prob
lem .is the "tension between indi
viduals' desires to be exhibitionists
on the Web and their desire for
private lives."
"Some people don't like info -
mation on then pages to be dis
tilled <>i having connections auto
matically drawn between them
selves and others. These are valid
concerns, and we understand il

|ulie Zelcnski, a lecturer in the
Computer Science Department
said, " I hev are using information
mat stiufents themselves have cho

there is a ver\ reasonable opt-oul
strateg\ — i.e. don't have a VVel:

want to keep private."
