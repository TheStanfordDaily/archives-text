Ihe paucity of spectators at most Stanford
sporting events raises two questions. One, are
Stanford students apathetic? Perhaps. Iwo, are
Stanford students busy? (lerlainh. Regardless of
their academic and extraeurriculai obligations,
however, Stanford students have 110 excuse not to
show up for at least one baseball game this week

What Ix-tter way to spend a Friday evening or a
weekend afternoon in early June than by kicking
hack with a group of friends, chomping on hot dogs,
sipping heer and rootingoll the Cardinal squad. For
baseball aficionados, there can be no decisi< >n; it's au
tomatic. A dav at Sunken Diamond promises a more
intimate view and connection to the game without a
dreadful commute to the I Hants' I'ac Bell or Oak
land's Network Associates Coliseum. In addition,
unlike hoops, baseball will not be broadcast on tele
vision either. And the price is right, too. Kven for
non-I.ins, the goigeous weather and mellow, but
spirited, environment should justify vour atten
dance.
In short, besides the pleasurable experience of
watching an exciting team tight toward a national
championship in beautiful surroundings, we Stan
ford students owe it to our school and our peers to
get out .ind support them. So, when vou're debat
ing what to do iliis weekend, just sav, " lake me out
to the ball game, take me out to the park.'"
