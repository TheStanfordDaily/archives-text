Common concert confirmed
'support for hip hop'
While attendance figures provide one
barometer for assessing a concert's suc
cess, yesterday's Daily editorial ("1 lip-hop
concert offers lessons for community")
overstates the importance of the fact that
last Sunday's show with Common and
Blackalicious did not sell out.
Selling out any show this Memorial Dav

weekend would have been difficult. Many
students choose to travel and. so close to fi
nals. others take the time to catch up on
school work. Moreover, this past weekend
in particular offered many excellent con
cert options across the Bay Area. Ili.it
1,100 people came to our show, combined
with last vear's sold out Memorial Audito
rium show with l lie Roots, speaks to the
considerable support lot hip-hop on cam
pus. The show with Common was a suc
cess on almost all counts, espccialh lor the
people \\ ho took in the show.
As an organization, the Stanford (ou
tfit network continually strives to present
programming that is popular among stu
dents and that appeals to Stanford's di
verse set ol musical tastes. 1 11 is year, we
are proud to have touched on genres like
lolk. rock, pop, funk, alternative, jaz/ and
hip-hop, mam ol which have been ne
glected in previous years. I lie concert net
work lias promoted hip-hop m the past
and w ill continue to in the future because
students have shown that they want to
hear it.
Sunday's show only served to confirm
that support for hip-hop is alive and well at
Stanford. More than 1.000 students were
in attendance — more than any other
show this year but Vertical Horizon —
and all the performers t onnnented on the

strong enthusiasm in the crowd. 1 heron
cert network will continue to promote hip
hop as part ol its larger goal <>1 presenting
a broad set ol live music lor the Stanlord
community.

Common concert confirmed
'support for hip hop'
While attendance figures provide one
barometer for assessing a concert's suc
cess, yesterday's Daily editorial ("1 lip-hop
concert offers lessons for community")
overstates the importance of the fact that
last Sunday's show with Common and
Blackalicious did not sell out.
Selling out any show this Memorial Dav

weekend would have been difficult. Many
students choose to travel and. so close to fi
nals. others take the time to catch up on
school work. Moreover, this past weekend
in particular offered many excellent con
cert options across the Bay Area. Ili.it
1,100 people came to our show, combined
with last vear's sold out Memorial Audito
rium show with l lie Roots, speaks to the
considerable support lot hip-hop on cam
pus. The show with Common was a suc
cess on almost all counts, espccialh lor the
people \\ ho took in the show.
As an organization, the Stanford (ou
tfit network continually strives to present
programming that is popular among stu
dents and that appeals to Stanford's di
verse set ol musical tastes. 1 11 is year, we
are proud to have touched on genres like
lolk. rock, pop, funk, alternative, jaz/ and
hip-hop, mam ol which have been ne
glected in previous years. I lie concert net
work lias promoted hip-hop m the past
and w ill continue to in the future because
students have shown that they want to
hear it.
Sunday's show only served to confirm
that support for hip-hop is alive and well at
Stanford. More than 1.000 students were
in attendance — more than any other

and all the performers t onnnented on the
