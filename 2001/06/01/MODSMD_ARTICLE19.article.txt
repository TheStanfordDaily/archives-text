Arguments against Greek
housing 'one-sided'

Ii seems to have l>e< nine an ine\n.ihili
ty.on 11 us <. i m | >i is thai, once springtime
rolls around and the subject ol Greek
housing is brought up, mam individuals
deem it necessary to disparage those .il
legedh elitist and hedonistic individuals
better known as sorority and (rateruitv
members.
Most recentlv, this has come in the lot in
of Brian Klinksiek's May letter to I he
Daily ("Fraternities 'do .1 disservice' to
Stanlord"), stating that Greeks perform .1
disservice to the community.
Perhaps this is only a case ol Ireshman
naivete 011 Klinksiek's part because he
seems rather out ol touch not only with
(.reek organizations and their purpose,
but also with lile on the Row.
While parties and free beer are a pleas
ant side effect ol having (ireeks 011 cam
pus, there is a lot more to (ireek lile than
contributing to the dclin(|ucnc\ ol minors
(and the social "life' of this campus). At the
risk ol sounding trite, philanthropv ac tu
ally happens to be lairly high on many
(.reek chapters' agendas. But writing
about fraternities giving unconditional
scholarships to Stanford students or the
time and money donated to c harities each
year doesn't quite make a front-page
headline the same way drunken debauch
ery does.
With the Office of Residential Educa
tion's recent revision of the criteria forget

ting and keeping (Â»reek housing, an un
housed (.reek chapter musi essentially
prove 11 is already making clients to pro
mote the goals ol Res Kd before the I 111-
versity will even consider granting a
house. I hat roughh e(juales to residential
education without a residence.
I his also helps lo ensure that, il any
c liaplet is lin k\ enough ever to get housed
m the lulure, it will cei tainK contribute at
least as much lo Stanford as anv Row
house does ( urrentK. wliic h is not a hard
(eat to achieve. I hat seems lo me like a
considerably less arbitrary criterion for
housing than a random lottery or some
people's lain u aled disabilities.
I'm c 111 Kins to know 111 particular what
kinds ol "disservice" Rlinksiek has wit
nessed from (.reek organizations. Maybe
he should ask his parents w hat kind ol dis
service the\ performed as (irceks when
they were 111 college. Because so far the
only disservice I've seen are llu- one-sided
arguments against ('.reeks that are aimed
at dividing the campus.

Many have 'nothing but good things to
say' about CDC services

As a member of the Dean ol Students
stall (ol w 11 i< li llie Career Development
Ccnict is a part). I am writing in response
to Kvan Meagher and Jacob Klein's letter,
"C.IK, bampered by lire; connection to

students unclear," printed in Wednes
day's Daily.
It is one thing to express pul)lu ly acon
< ei n about the serv ices provided by a Uni
versity department. An even better idea
would be to take that concern directly to
the department in question. Since the
writers chose a public forum In which to
air their grievances, I feel the need to pro
vide the public with another perspective.
\\ it 11 regard to the- comments about ('.!)('
services, my experience with this center
has been nothing less than excellent. I lav
ing been at Stanlcxcl lor only one year, I
have had the opportunity to make obser
vations with a fresh set ol eves; I can say
that the students I have referred to the
( DC. lor counseling, job resources and a
multitude ol other services have come
back, without exception, with nothing but
good things to saw
With regard to Meaghei and Klein's
comments about the lire, it is my hope that
Stanford w ill teac li these students some
empathy in addition to the line classroom
education they are receiving. Of course,
the ( l)( lire is inconvenient for students,
but the letter did not mention one word
about the CDC. stall who have spent the
l.isi twodays rummaging through lire and
smoke damaged hallways trying to un
earth student files in addition to their per
son,il items, such as college diplomas, pic
tures of loved ones and the plethora of
other things working people keep in their
