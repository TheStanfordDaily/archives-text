I lead coach Mark Marquess must have thought ju
nior third baseman Andy I opham was a little hot at
the end of practice on Tuesday. Alter three hours in
the sweltering sun, Marquess grabbed the hose to
water the infield, but sprayed Topham with a re
freshing burst instead.
"I le's just in a good mood," Topham said. "If it's a
hot day like today, he thinks it's funny to go out and
squirt us. As long as he doesn't get my shoes and bat
ting gloves wet, it's line."
In the aftermath of coming out on top of last
weekend's baseball marathon, not many people can
blame Marquess for lus somewhat lighthearted
mood in practice this week. I le still hasn't lost sight,
though, of the task at hand for the No. I Cardinal
(46-15), which starts tonight against South Carolina
at Sunken Diamond.
"He keeps telling us that all we've got to do is win

two out of three to go to ()maha,'' sophomore Rvan
(iarko said.
At least Marquess's mathematical abilities
haven't gone by the wayside, either. A series win for
the Cardinal this weekend, and the surprising
young squad will make its way ba< k to the College
World Series in an attempt to avenge a disappoint
ing loss to Louisiana State in the 2000 CAVS < ham
pionship game.
" I his is where we've wanted to be since we lost that
game last year, and i iglit now we're really < l< >se. I like
our chances this weekend," (iarko said.
Stanford will not be the only team on the field this
weekend coming off of a strenuous regional. The
Gamecocks (18-18) also made their way through the
loser's bracket of the double-elimination bracket,
beating top-seeded Central Florida twice last Sunday
to advance to the NCAA Super Regional.
Keeping in mind the Gamecocks' dramatic


Stanford and junior third baseman Andy Topham, named to the all-regional team last weekend after hitting a pair
of bombs, begin another tester tonight against South Carolina. The winner of the three-game set heads to Omaha.
