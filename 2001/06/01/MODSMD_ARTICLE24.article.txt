wait until the final stretch to over
take those who had passed him.
Stember's notoriously strong
kick allowed him to finish fourth,
therein grabbing the List automatic
qualilving spot lor finals.
"1 wish I had run differently," he
said. "It's a little frustrating, but you
have to move on and focus on the
