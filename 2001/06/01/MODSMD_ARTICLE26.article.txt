-11 lis vear's Stan lord men's tennis team certainly did
not anticipate a repeat <>l the I'.M.H) season.
However, reminiscent ol the HUM) N(IAA men's
tennis ( hampionships, when the (!ai dinal was ousted
l>\ Bavloi in the Kound ol Hi. this season, the top-seed
ed Stanford ('J 1-2) was upset l>\ eighth-seeded I en
nessee (23-5) in the quarto liu.ils, 1-2.
I he team was without its No. 1 man, seniot Alex

Kim, m both singles and doubles. Kim spent two days
m the hospital and was forced to miss the team com
petition because ol dehydration.
Alter third-seeded (Georgia upended I ennessee, 1-
1, in the N(IAA team finals, four ol Stanford's top play
ers continued on in the individual singles and doubles
tout nainents last 1 hursday.
l op-ranked Kim was never the same after his in
jur\ and nuJde early exits in both singles and doubles.
I le ended his linal year as a Cardinal with a 20-5 sin
gles record after losing in the first round.
Kim also teamed with junior K.J. 1 lippensteel and
moved into the second round before falling to Vir
ginia's Huntley Montgomery and Brian Vahaly, the
nation s top-ranked doubles team.
Ihe l&th-ranked Hippensteel (35-8) almost
e(|iialed his semifinal singles finish from last year l>\
playing his way into the quarterfinals.
Sophomore David Martin (25-13) made his debut
in postseason singles play by falling to the eventual sin
gles and doubles champion, third-seeded Matias
Boeker ol (.eorgia, in the lit st round.
Martin had nun h better success in doubles when he
teamed with sophomore Scott Lipsky and the two es
tablished themselves as a doubles pair (37-0) to watch
lot I hey breezed into the semifinals belore falling to
the eventual champions, second-seeded Boeker and
I i.i\is I'arroit ol (ieorgia.
Although tlieC '.ardinal was unable toboast even one
individual trophy this year, the Stanford competitors
were able to earn three All-American honors. Kim and
Hippensteel earned honors in singles, and Martin/
I apsky eai ned honors in doubles.
Kim's condition was uncertain throughout the
postseason, Ihii Ins frustration over the wav that Stan
lord ended Us season was obvious.
"Ii was definitely really disappointing to end the
season like that, especially when I wasn't even able to
pla\Kim said. "It was pist a lot ol bad lu< k, and it was
an unfortunate thing to happen. I think we had prob
al>l\ the besi team here, whi( h but ts because we were
supposed to win it, but we didn't. It jiisi didn't go oiu
w ay I his year."
Kim is one ol three seniors who will leave alter ibis
season to join the professional Al Ptour. I he ('ardinal
w ill als< > lose the services ol All Ansari, who graduated
last (quarter, and Scotty S< ott.
Ansari (32-7) finished his last season .is a Cardinal
with a career-high numbei ol wins at singles. Playing
mostly at N'os. 5 and 0 all year, Ansai i established hini
sell as a liei v workhorse whom head coach Dick Gould
could always count on fora quick point.
Although Scott (20-9) was hampered by injury and
illness al the beginning of the year, he was also a inain
sia\ in the starting lineup al No. 1 and No. 5 singles.
Ansai i and Scott (2<S-9) also provided the ('.ardinal
with lhe II st-ranked doubles team in the nation. ('on

sidcring that tliev plaved mostly at No. 3 doubles, their
.ilulitv to break into the national rankings is a tribute to
their consistently line pla\.
All three seniors will be missed, but Kim, who has
steadily progressed from the team's No. (> playei i<>
being the top player in the country, will be yen dilli
( ult to replace.
Although (>< >uld will miss Kim's consistent 1\ scorch
ing groundstrokes and all-around game, he said he
hopes that I lippensteel's dramatic all\ impro\ ing game
will be able to lead Stanford to a title next year. (ioulcl
said that I lippensteel was pla\ing his best tennis ol the
season dm ing the N('.\\ Championships.
As the season progressed, the 1 Ith-rankecl doubles
team ol Kim and I lippensteel slowly validated (iould's
dec ision to paii the two, who had never played togetli
ei belore. I he\ finished the season with a 21 -("> recc>rd.
aliei starting the year at 5-4.
|<Â»ining I lippensteel next year will be a strong core
ol lour current sophomores, including two who were
siai lets all year.
Martin and Ryan I laviland (22-9) were starters at
the No. and No. 1 spots lor Stanford. I he two were

a bit shak\ at times in the middle ol the season, but
both eventualk proved to be players th.it (>ould can
< ount on to plav higher positions next vear.
I heolhei two sophomores are l)7th-rankecl Lipsky
(21-1) and ('.alter Morris (7-4). l.ipsk) repeatedly
showed the potential to be a starter throughout a
strong postseason.
I he team will also be looking Ibrward to the devel
opment ol its two i in rent freslnnen, Joseph Kao (l-.'i)
and 1 duai do ( ard< >so (2-1). Several new recruits Irom
high school w ill round out the team.
" I think we'll be a very good team next vear, but we
will be a clillerent team." (loulcl said. "We'll miss the
leadership ol the three seniors because they've given
us tremendous lire. We'll see tl there are am guvs now
oi am new gu\ s w ho will help pic k up that void."
When all is said and done, the team was probabb an
ni|iir\ lluke awa\ liom capping oil a great season by
winning the championship again.
"I tliiiik it was a great season, overall, espec iall\ in
the regulat season," Martin said. "We only lost once."
