"I larvard u ill follow with the sec -

I'rescod-W'einstein said.
Kenneth Kbie, a senior .it Har

"We want to look at what it
means to be a diverse society,"'

the sources of inequalities in oui
society, particularly 111 the areas ol
differences."
Levin said the goal ol the (on
lerence was to "c reate .1 new tvpe

Aitei holding a kiekoll eonferenee
several weeks ago on interactive

ing and usage ol "politic al correct
ness." Stanlord prepares to hold its
(onlerence this weekend.
"I larvard u ill follow with the sec -
ond l\ii e ol America conference on
Friday, Sept. 'JS, and Saturday,
Sept. 29. 2001. The events this
weekend follow a veiy successful
vidcoconlerence this past month
that featured former Federal Com
munications Commission Chan
man William Kennard." said senior
Mike Levin, moderator and co-or
ganizer ol the event.
()nl\ about two do/en students
attended the kickofl event on both
campuses, which was far fewer
than eat li school's expected. I low
ever. the organizers say they aim
to build on the momentum that
came from the conference.
Chanda I't esc od-Weinstein, .1
student panelist for I larvard, said
that the kiekoll conference allowed
those who attended to "move to

ward tlit* consensus thai political
correctness wasn't the issue, more
so the concept behind it."
"It's .i waste ol discussion il we
don't put it into action alierwards,"
I'rescod-W'einstein said.
Kenneth Kbie, a senior .it Har
vard and co-chair ol the confer
ence's planning committee on the
I larvard end, said that the pin pose
ol the conference is to increase
awareness about diversit\ and the
issues surrounding it in America.
"We want to look at what it
means to be a diverse society,"'
Kbie said. "Rarely do we look at

the sources of inequalities in oui
society, particularly 111 the areas ol
differences."
Levin said the goal ol the (on
lerence was to "c reate .1 new tvpe
ol dialogue on clivcrsit\ al college
campuses like Stanlord and Har
vard . . . We hope to discuss con
troversial topic sand have all sides
represented; our onl\ agenda is to
get students to share theii per
spectives with one another and to
ensure iheii voices are heard in a
1 espec 11ul. open dialogue."
