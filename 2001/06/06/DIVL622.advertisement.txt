Juggling a career with a family can be an overwhelming challenge. For many women,
the most daunting question still remains: career or motherhood? In 2001, do we still have
to choose, and if so, do we have to sacrifice one to be truly successful in the other?
In Getting it Right, Dr. I.araine Zappert, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences
at Stanford University, addresses women's ongoing struggle with the work/family dilemma.
She challenges the myth that women of all ages can, and should, do it all—and if they
can't or don't want to, they have failed. Getting it Right, offers invaluable assistance to
working out the delicate balance between career and family.
