To the Ops Department and Editorial Board, you have been wonderful.
In case you were curious, Nadira Angelina Hira,the editor in chief of The Stanford Daily, wasn't quite ready to say goodbye.
Expect her farewell — finally — in the Commencement issue. We really are making her leave. We promise.
Letters to the Editor will also appear in the Commencement issue, so write back. Really.
