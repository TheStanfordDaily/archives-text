What was the
Beat Generation?"
Renowned
Beat Scholar,
Beat Scholar, Ann Charters, has written a wide-ranging anthology that attempts
to define and explore the ideas and attitudes that changed American culture in the
Beat generation. Compiling over seventy-five essays, reviews, memoirs, poems
and sketches that evoke the credos and the controversies surrounding the Beat
generation writers of the 19505, Charters includes discussions of all major Beat
figures - Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady,
Diane di Prima, Gary Snyder and many more. She also explores the humorous side
of the Beat generation, its place in post-World War II American culture, and the
contribution of the important women authors who also wrote Beat.
