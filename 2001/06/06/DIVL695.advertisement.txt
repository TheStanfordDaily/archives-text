Randail E. Stross
Randall Stross,
Presents
eßoys:
The First
Inside Account
of Venture
Capitalists
at Work
Randall Stross will discuss his book, eßoys,
which is an effort to understand the decade
of the 1990'5, by understanding venture
capitalists. These are the people who listen
to business pitches by the score, the financial
world equivalent of miners turning over tons
of earth in search of precious metal. Focused
on the venture capitalist firm who pioneered
Silicon Valley success stories, such as eßay and
Webvan, Randall Stross tells the story of how a
group of not-so-middle-aged men at Benchmark
Capital made an investment that returned
a Silicon Valley record of 100,000 percent.
