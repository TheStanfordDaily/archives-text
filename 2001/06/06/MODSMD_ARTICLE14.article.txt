should be available to hikers and joggers
and what the trails' hours of operation
should be.
Despite a storm of controversx last tall
over the restriction of Dish access to a sin
gle paved road, traffic to and from the
scenic Foothill destination has remained
robust throughout the year.
"We've been monitoring the data on
usage of the Dish, and usage is still verv,
very strong," said Farrv 112 forton, the direc
tor of government and community rela
