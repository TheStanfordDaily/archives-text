show n, even .is seniors are extending tlieii hands
to take that diploma, that words mean more than
actions. Most reccntlv, I niversitN President |ohn

As this scar's class pushes through the gradua
tion door, the I Diversity's failure to overcome
mam lailcd attempts at plugging holes with lan
guage alone, .1 lix that, like cheap wine, returns
announcing its presence again in less than un
derstated ways, is astounding. I here are two
things that one should never skimpon: wine and
trust. Although both are intertwined, the latter is
the more important, and the I Diversity has failed
to follow (he truth behind the aphorism.
I his \car has ended the same way it began,
with 111:111\ promises and more words, which the
I niversitN has used like a strainer to carry water
to each briishfire. II it* latest in the long line of at
tempts is Nvell-intentionetl and wonderful if it ac
tiialK finds its w.in from the lips that spoke them
to the realm of at lion and responsibility.
I lenncssN delivered a well thought out plan to
hire a 1 it I attr.u 1 nian\ more minorities to the I ni

involves more committees and rules by which

I hose committees must function in their search
for prospective professors.
But if Hennessy and Provost John
Ftchemendy's most recent announcement ( rum
hies in the list of compromise and disillusionment
as many other proposals and public statements
have, watch out. Beginning with the Foothills,
through the seesawing over the department incit
er ,iiid the(lommencement speaker, the I niversi
ty has walked a fine line l)etween language and
smoke-screen.
I he community has learned to accept the pave
ment across the Foothills, and the fiscal arguments
over the meiger have begun to settle into the prag
matic sand, and the choice of a (lommciucmcnt
speaker will always leave one segment of campus
wanting, but the promises of faculty lin ings and
the attraction ol diverse and competent professors
is a battle the University can't allbrd to lose. I len
nessv's statement was welcomed by the awaiting
ears of the senate and students, but, like a sweet

and the stomach storming.
I his \ear alone, the school has witnessed the
loss nl two irreplaceable professors in Assoc. Vis
iting Religions Studies Prof. Ibrahim Moosa and
Vice Provost for Student Aflairs |ames Montoya,
both minorities, but, more importantly, incredi
ble teachers and role models. II the University is
serious ,ilx>ut its commitment to (acuity diversity
and student life, they must remember that
progress is measured, not in the number of
sugar-dipped words or rehearsed speeches, but
in the results, the actions.
So lar, the I niversity has relied on words and
stalling ploys, but students will not put up with in
adequate teaching «mcl lack of a good, diverse,
well-qualified faculty. As a gift to the departing
class .iikl to show its commitment to the school's
future, the I niversity should use faculty diversity,
<111 issue it hascorrectlv taken the lead on, as a way
to right its path on student and faculty issues.
