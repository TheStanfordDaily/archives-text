meant ili.il one loses some control. It is,
ol course, .i wonder I ul I liin<; to he swept
oil \oiu leel .uid have someone "mess it
all up."
Stanford does this vcr\ same tiling.
(I 11us, I>\ the transitive Iheorv, Stanford
is ,i 111 lend?)
Mam ol us came liei e feeling on top ol
the world. We were alhleles and editors,
perfi>inieis and schol.us. We were in
solved in student jjoNcrnmctil, in iluhs
.ind in comiminiiN scivue. Many of oiii
li\es felt sorted out. I lien i.nne Stanford
to sweep us off (Mil feel and to make us
question things oiii go.ils, otu \.ilues,
oiii finures.
I use the lei in "we" looseh. No. not ev
en one i .line from I lie same I >.k
in lad, <guile the contrary. No. not everv
l)od\ had the same eve-opening experi
ences .it Slanlord. Hul I do Ijelieve that a
pail ol college having to re-evalu.ite
pre( onceiwd notions alioui the world and
alxMil yourself.
Stanford li.is done 111 is lot me. Ii has
made me lose <onlideiK e, in seeing the tal
ent thai sun ounds us every dav, and it has
made me gain that confidence I>.k k. in
learning tli.il, il I worked haid enough, I
100 ((Mild sii( ( eed here.
And so, .is we |insert (lie he lierej, we
must .isk oiii selves what we will lake with
lis when we leave this pl.n e. I, for one, will
lake the half-eaten yogurt that hasheen sit
ting in m\ fridge loi the past three and a
hall \c.il s. Hul what else?
I'ei haps we will leave with nicinoi ics of

hallways and late-night debates. Perhaps
we will leave with llie wisdom to accept
people as ihe\ are, to lose them lot being
true to thciiisclu's, even il ihe\ behave dif
h icni l\ I ban we do. IVi haps wc will linal
l\ understand thai, no mallet how man\
pairs ol bathing suns you own to wear
when vou run out ol boxers, eventiialh
vou arc going lo need lo do the laundry.
Mavbe we w ill laugh at how we alwavs
said 11 icrc was no dating ai Si an lord, as we
sit beside a spouse, oiu e ah lend from oiu
dormitory. ()i mavbe we will cry as we
wonder win we nc\ei took initiative to
break that stcrcoi\pe.
Kver\ moment here has been a learn
ing expericnt c. While we need not do cv
eiviliing in lilc to le.u n.it isci ucial that we
Icai n Irom even thing we do in lile. I here
have been so mam memorable lessons
here, loi example, papers ( an. in l.n I. be
started and finished the night belbrc the)
are due. I lining the snooze button more
lb.in three limes docs, in I.k t. often result
m a shoe being thrown at voui lace.
Km there arc main things we still must
leal n. A peel oik c told llie thai he thought
th.it most students,it Stanford didn't listen
\cr\ well. Ilc said some more things, but I
wasn't rcall\ paying attention.
We nilist learn to listen. We must tr\ to
understand oiliei views. We nnisi always
remain humble and grateful. I liink how
lottunatc vou arc. Now understand that
vou are not soleb responsible lot being
where you arc todav. Vou aie lucky. And
\oii have main io thank.
I hank youi parents — you graduate
on !• at bet s I )a\. I'hatik yotu tcachei sand
voui friends. I hank youi roommates.
Whether you got along or not. the interac
tion helped le.u li vou to live with others.
Irv not to |ti(lgc others. fry not to
preat h or to tell others what to do. Espe
cially not in a column in IhcDailv. Cry not
to wonder il thc\ w ill get the irony and the
liutnoi in that statement.
No. I <un not claiming to have the an
swers. I'm still woi king on the (|iiestions.
hut I do try to keep my eyes open to new
perspectives. I do hope that I have
shown you some things in these past 10
weeks or so that you ma) not have seen
otherwise. I do hope that we have devel
oped the friendship thai I mentioned
and hoped lor in tin first column. And,
lor this, I thank you.
Now get bat k to studying lor your finals.
