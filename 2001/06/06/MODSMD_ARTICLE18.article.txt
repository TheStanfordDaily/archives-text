## Increased funding 'greatly enhances' ability to serve students 
### 
As tlu- stall of Stanford's six campus
<ommunity centers, wc would like to
express to I niversitv President Hen
nessv and Provost John Ktchemendy
our appreciation for the recent in
< rease in resources allocated to our
programs. I his funding increase great
ly enhances our ability to serve our
< omniunitics. It demonstrates the pres
ident and provost's understanding of
the integral role our (enters play in the
intellectual, cultural and social lives ol
Stanford students.
Additional funding enables each (en
ter to continue its current efforts and
seek new and innovative ways to engage
the entire Stanford community in dia
logue about issues of diversity. Programs
such as Asian Pacific Islander Heritage
Month, Black Liberation Month, the
Chicano / Latino Community Awards
lianquct, Stanford Queer Awareness
Days, Stanford Powwow and the Inter
national Women's Days Celebration are
made possible through creative collabo
ration between many campus con
stituencies. These events provide count
less opportunities for students to inte
grate scholarship with service, activism
and advocacy.
I he financial support lor our centers
has empowered us to be able to focus on
student development without the con
stant pressure of fundraising. The fund

Center has enabled these two tenters to
function on a more equal level with the
other tenters. I hese addition.il re
sources lor all t enters will be used loi the
betterment ol Stanford as a whole.
Again, thank you President Hcnncssv
and Provost Kit heniently for your
demonstrated support ol our work. We
will continue to work toward making
Stanford a welcoming and nurturing
place loi all students.

preparation and the possible damage
done to inner city, African-American,
Latino and immigrant children hv un
derqualified, uncertified teachers.

'hypocritically stereotypical'
L.isi week, 1 received .111 e-mail publi

Fetish rally, protesting Asian female
stereotypes. Intrigued, 1 stopped my hike
in White Plaza before the rally, expecting
progressive, awareness-raising activism.
I o my dismay, I quickly found that the
ideas behind this event ( entered more on

paper. Taken aback by the request, I de
