## Increased funding 'greatly enhances' ability to serve students

As tlu- stall of Stanford's six campus
<ommunity centers, wc would like to
express to I niversitv President Hen
nessv and Provost John Ktchemendy
our appreciation for the recent in
< rease in resources allocated to our
programs. I his funding increase great
ly enhances our ability to serve our
< omniunitics. It demonstrates the pres
ident and provost's understanding of
the integral role our (enters play in the
intellectual, cultural and social lives ol
Stanford students.
Additional funding enables each (en
ter to continue its current efforts and
seek new and innovative ways to engage
the entire Stanford community in dia
logue about issues of diversity. Programs
such as Asian Pacific Islander Heritage
Month, Black Liberation Month, the
Chicano / Latino Community Awards
lianquct, Stanford Queer Awareness
Days, Stanford Powwow and the Inter
national Women's Days Celebration are
made possible through creative collabo
ration between many campus con
stituencies. These events provide count
less opportunities for students to inte
grate scholarship with service, activism
and advocacy.
I he financial support lor our centers
has empowered us to be able to focus on
student development without the con
stant pressure of fundraising. The fund

uig ol the two assistant director positions
for the Lesbian, C»ay, Bisexual and
I ransgcndci C.onununitN Resources
('.enter and the Women's Community
Center has enabled these two tenters to
function on a more equal level with the
other tenters. I hese addition.il re
sources lor all t enters will be used loi the
betterment ol Stanford as a whole.
Again, thank you President Hcnncssv
and Provost Kit heniently for your
demonstrated support ol our work. We
will continue to work toward making

Rally against Asian female stereotypes
'hypocritically stereotypical'
L.isi week, 1 received .111 e-mail publi

tivism Coalition's May 29 "I'm Not Your
Fetish rally, protesting Asian female
stereotypes. Intrigued, 1 stopped my hike
in White Plaza before the rally, expecting
progressive, awareness-raising activism.
I o my dismay, I quickly found that the
ideas behind this event ( entered more on
projecting hostility toward white men
than empowering Asian women. After I
had happily accepted a free "I'm Not
\ our Fetish I-shirt and Nfonolid maga
zine, the student stalling the rally table in
vited me to write mv negative experiences
with white men on a piece of butcher
paper. Taken aback by the request, I de
clined, but noted that somebody had al
ready taken her up on the oiler will) a
negative comment about white men.
A later perusal ol Monolicl confirmed
niv suspicions that the organizers ol'the
rally support destructive dialogue over
community-building. I he magazine con
tains blatantly offensive remarks con
demning .ill white men .is fetishists and .ill
Asian women dating white men .is hapless
vic tims unaware of their own self-hate.
For example, the editor likens the
"one unfortunate time" she held hands
with a white man to "[eating] a m<>ld\ pear
with <i thousand mosquitoes teeming .11

the hope that, "M\ Asian sistei will marry
<i vcllow m.in instead ol letting herself be
in the clutches of a white toad. Lord
knows we have enough of iliese ridic uloiis
people masquerading as husband and
wile in our holy streets."
I do not deny the existence of stereo
types of Asian women as "exotic " or "sub
missive," nor do I deny the right of Asian
women who have been subjected to dis
crimination to Ik* angrv and venal. ( learlv,

As tlu- stall of Stanford's six campus
<ommunity centers, wc would like to
express to I niversitv President Hen
nessv and Provost John Ktchemendy
our appreciation for the recent in
< rease in resources allocated to our
programs. I his funding increase great
ly enhances our ability to serve our
< omniunitics. It demonstrates the pres
ident and provost's understanding of
the integral role our (enters play in the
intellectual, cultural and social lives ol
Stanford students.
Additional funding enables each (en
ter to continue its current efforts and
seek new and innovative ways to engage
the entire Stanford community in dia
logue about issues of diversity. Programs
such as Asian Pacific Islander Heritage
Month, Black Liberation Month, the
Chicano / Latino Community Awards
lianquct, Stanford Queer Awareness
Days, Stanford Powwow and the Inter
national Women's Days Celebration are
made possible through creative collabo
ration between many campus con
stituencies. These events provide count
less opportunities for students to inte
grate scholarship with service, activism
and advocacy.
I he financial support lor our centers
has empowered us to be able to focus on
student development without the con
stant pressure of fundraising. The fund

uig ol the two assistant director positions
for the Lesbian, C»ay, Bisexual and
I ransgcndci C.onununitN Resources
('.enter and the Women's Community
Center has enabled these two tenters to
function on a more equal level with the
other tenters. I hese addition.il re
sources lor all t enters will be used loi the
betterment ol Stanford as a whole.
Again, thank you President Hcnncssv
and Provost Kit heniently for your
demonstrated support ol our work. We
will continue to work toward making
Stanford a welcoming and nurturing
place loi all students.

Rally against Asian female stereotypes
'hypocritically stereotypical'
L.isi week, 1 received .111 e-mail publi
cizing llie Stanford Asian American Ac
tivism Coalition's May 29 "I'm Not Your
Fetish rally, protesting Asian female
stereotypes. Intrigued, 1 stopped my hike
in White Plaza before the rally, expecting
progressive, awareness-raising activism.
I o my dismay, I quickly found that the
ideas behind this event ( entered more on
projecting hostility toward white men
than empowering Asian women. After I
had happily accepted a free "I'm Not
\ our Fetish I-shirt and Nfonolid maga
zine, the student stalling the rally table in
vited me to write mv negative experiences
with white men on a piece of butcher
paper. Taken aback by the request, I de
clined, but noted that somebody had al
ready taken her up on the oiler will) a
negative comment about white men.
A later perusal ol Monolicl confirmed
niv suspicions that the organizers ol'the
rally support destructive dialogue over
community-building. I he magazine con
tains blatantly offensive remarks con
demning .ill white men .is fetishists and .ill
Asian women dating white men .is hapless
vic tims unaware of their own self-hate.
For example, the editor likens the
"one unfortunate time" she held hands
with a white man to "[eating] a m<>ld\ pear
with <i thousand mosquitoes teeming .11
the core." A mock "prayer c ard" (ontains
the hope that, "M\ Asian sistei will marry
<i vcllow m.in instead ol letting herself be
in the clutches of a white toad. Lord
knows we have enough of iliese ridic uloiis
people masquerading as husband and
wile in our holy streets."
I do not deny the existence of stereo
types of Asian women as "exotic " or "sub
missive," nor do I deny the right of Asian
women who have been subjected to dis
crimination to Ik* angrv and venal. ( learlv,
this is a valid issue that needs lo be ad
dressed. Ii is unfortunate that ihe spon

sors of the rallv, the Stanford Asian Amer
ican Activism Coalition and Monolicl,
c hose to present this issue i<> the Stanford
communil\ in a wa\ that is entirel) nega
tive. I he tactic <>l projecting general lios
tility toward white men is hypocritically
stereotypical in itself. Worst ol all, iliis soi i
ol harmful dialogue undermines cllorts to
promote openness and mutual under
standing on (Ins c ampus.
