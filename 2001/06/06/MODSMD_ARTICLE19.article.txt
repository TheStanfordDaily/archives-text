### MARK GANEK GUEST COLUMNIST 
Ah, spring. lis my favorite time of
ilit' year. I he mellifluous voices
of birds echo through the fra

virgin petals to the sun-sweetened skv.
Meanwhile, Stanford students st urn In
without noticing, naked desperation in
their reddened eves. Acknowledgement of
beauty has become a luxury that even
final-plagued sludeni can ill afford, inui h
like sleep.
Food intake has also dropped lo .1 min
imum <ind is limited to two food groups:
boxed and bagged. Flic small ones have
switched to protein powder and hamster
food pellets, or simply visited ilie local
speed peddler. (There's one in every
dorm if you know where to look). 1 lie
karmic debt of .t carefree spring quarter

of suffering.

I lie anguish is 1101 onl\ ol .111 academic

are special and possess exemptions from
every rule save gravity, they are encoun

Anxiety, paranoia and importunate vi
sions of an evil sort invade our brains. We
try to coin eiitratc 011 our papers coinern

All we can see in the unholy glow of our
computer monitors is the vast distended
head of Alfred F. Neuman crving tears ol
blood m the moonlight. We keep t\ping,
each keystroke torture, 0111 fingernails bit

ten down to bloody nubs.
As frightening as it may seem, the Stan
lord campus, usually out of touch with
what passes lor a real world, is perfectly in
tune with the current workings ol jolly old
Karih. Here's a quick rundown lor those
w hose universes have shrunk to solipsistic
husks over the past lew weeks.
The crown prince ol Nepal murdered
Ins entire iamily over an astrological mar
riage dispute, then committed suicide.
Some sort of terrilying "man-monke\" is
terrori/.ing New Delhi. It has lieen sighted
h\ over 100 people and has caused two

and the rest of the Arab world prepares to
rush to tlie Palestinians'aid. Hie entire area

rock star, is now a Jehovah's Witness. It
seems i eality it.self is having a nervous break
down, and 1 don't think the\ make Pro/ac
that potent.
Kven the U.S. government, which

prides itscll on being a bastion ol sanity 111
.1 world populated by fanatics, terrorists
and (gasp) foreigners, has succumbed to
the siren song of entropy. I he Hush ad
ministration, headless, is thrashing about
like a drunken SIT student at a f'rat party.
Defense Se( rctan Donald Rumsfeld "acci
dentallv" cut oil all relations with China
for about six hours, blaming the entire in
cident on a bumbling aide, which raises
the possibility ol One hung-over aide start
ing World War 111 by mishearing "calm
right wing" as "bomb Beijing."
Fhe Bush (amp, under it's operating
philosophy—"What do you mean the
Cold War is over?" — lias also dec ided lo
launch a space warfare initiative, complete
with weapon-equipped satellites and
space-based military plat lor ins that will be
able to rain lien death from the skies. I lie

With panic and ruin running amok
throughout the world toda\, does it te.il

What are you, a (iominunist? As we stare
into the depths of the abyss, it is impor
tant for us it> maintain our lack ol per
spective. We are the overat hicvers, and it
is our job to succeed at whatcvei ihcv put
in front of us. even if the world does dis
integrate into chaos and anarchy two
weeks after graduation.
I plan to be asleep.
