Stanford is committed to providing an
environment in which even student can

pursue the undergraduate experience he
desires. For some, that means stalling a
house or living in a co-op, ethnic or aca
demic theme dormitorv. I liese housing
situations don't appeal to everyone, and
all provide what some see as an unfair way
out ol the Draw. Regardless, the range of
options that they bring to the Stanford ex

cliversitv of experiences available to Stan
lord students.
Noting that the benefits ol (ireek hous

Row I ask Force and (ireek I lousing Re
view board advised the administration to
strengthen the criteria lot housing (ireek
groups. Under the previous policies, a
maximum of I I to 12 fraternities and
sororities would be housed. Now, the
maximum is nine to 10 houses. Finally, the
application process was made more trans
parent — lot example, unlike last year's
three-week notice, houses that may "go

Cireek" were announced a full year in ad
vance. In addition, mote forums for gen
