Try ihis brain teaser. You're a profes
sional basketball player for the WNBA,
and you're pursuing two graduate de
grees at iht- same time. Training camp for
the coming season clashes with finals week
of spring quarter. What do you do?
If you are Kate I'aye, currently balanc
ing her spot as floor general lor the Min
nesota Lynx with a lull load ol ( lasses at
Stanford, your answer will probably in
volve the I lonor (iode.
A joint JD-MBA degree student, I'aye
was allowed to do het law exams in Min
nesota when lated with a similar conflict
List year. " I he school does a good job
helping with creative solutions," she said.
She's counting on that kind ol Ilexibilitv
with her MBA classes this year.
I'aye is a striking example ol the kind of
all-round excellence that students can
reach lor, thanks to the trust that the
I lonor (lode places in them.
I he code is a commitment bv students
to uphold academic honesty. ()n its part,
faculty members show their faith in stu
dents by, for example, refraining from
proctoring exams. Since exams ai Stan
lord are not proctored, instructors rarely
object to athletes on the road doing iheir
exams unsupervised. Some Stanford bas
ketball players in the NCAA Tournament
often take their finals in their hotel rooms
between games.
Verity Powell. Academic Adviser to the
Department of Athletic s, said that cooper

ation from lac nit \ is almost universal.'
"Ninety-live percent ol laculty are good
about giving exams to me, or sealed in an
envelope to a coach, 01 faxing them to the
students themselves."
Last year, lor example, two softbal)
players on a road trip to San Diego took a
timed exam in the conference room of
their hotel. I he exam had remained in a
sealed envelope until the students were
ready to take it. I lit- two students timed
themselves and laxed their answers to
their prolessor.
Kira C.hing, a sophomore on the soil
ball team, said she appreciates sue h h list.
" I he Honor (ode works well for athletes
because n makes missing exams mm h less
of a problem."
One sign ol Stanford s success in b.il
ancing spoil and scholarship is that the*
I niversity li.is been awarded the Sears Di
rector's Cup, .in award given to the na
tion's best athletic program, for the past
live years.
But do athletes abuse the trust tlie£
have been given? Alone in a hotel room,
can one rcall\ be expec ted lo observe ihe
rules of a limed, closed-book exam?
Powell savs that although athletes art#
accused ol violations, thev are no more
ill.in non-athletes. Judicial oHicci Nancy
Morrison savs ih.it "athletes are not over
represented" among violators.
While the athlete on ihe road tna\ have
greater opportunil) i<> cheat, there are
also strong incentives against doing so.
I he standard penalty fora fust-time of

hours of communit v service. II (lie quartet
