WASHINGTON (AP) —
Hie Bush administration is
considering a plan to rate nurs
ing homes, dialysis centers and
other Medicare providers and
in.ik.t- the information available
to consumers.
Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy Thompson
said yesterday that any rating
system would be part of the ad
ministration's proposal to over
haul Medicare, the federal
health insurance program for
the elderly.
I here are going to be a lot
of changes," he said. "Ratings
are something that we are cur
rently considering."
Thompson said a decision
had not yet been made, but that
an announcement would come
in the next 10 days.
Earlier yesterday, the
spokesman for the agency that
oversees Medicare said the gov
ernment had no plans to create
.i scorecard of ratings.
"We are not in the business
of rating any of these
providers," said Peter Ashke
na/, spokesman for the- Health
(.are Financing Administration,
which oversees Medicare, Med
icaid and other federal health
insurance programs.
"People who benefit from
these services and the people
who help them make their de
cisions need to have good un
biased information so they can
make the best choices for
themselves."
I homas Scully, the newly in
stalled chief of the Medicare
agency, said the Bush adminis
tration plans overhauls ilia! in
clude doubling I he enrollment of
seniors in Medic are's If M() pro
gram, ci .u king down on fraudu
lent providers and liecfingup the
Internet and 800-phone service
the agency uses to get health ( are
data to beneficiaries.
In his first public remarks
since Ins Senate confirmation
last month, Scully said Monday
the agency, an arm of the 1 fealth
and Human Services Depart
ment, will announce a plan to
market its Medicare + Choice
program. In recent years, many
health plans have bolted the
program, which currently offers
HMO coverage lo about 15 per
cent of the 10 million elderly
and disabled served by
Medicare. I lie goal will be to in
(rease the membership lo ai
least .SO percent of Medicare en
rollees by 2005, Scully said.
I hat effort would be part of

the administration's overall plan
to dramatically change the Intle
known, but often embattled
agency, he said.
I think we can explain our
selves a lot better," S( ully told a
meeting of business executives,
doctors and other health care
providers who have questioned
the paperwork and regulations
required for Medicare reim
bursements. "We have a respon
sibility to do that."
II you have good objective,
rational policv. you'll win," Scul
ly added.
( urrentlv, Ashkena/ said, the
federal government offers pa
tients information gathered
from state health agencies on
the nursing homes and other
health caregivers who get feder
al health dollars. Such data in
clude, for instance, how well
nursing homes are stalled.
Ashkena/ said the govern
incut also relies on data collec t
ed from private and govern
ment organizations tli.it survey
health plans and their cus
tomers. For example, con
sumers are asked whether their
insurers return phone calls or
help them in other ways.
I here are no ratings, he
said, jusi survey results. He
said the federal government
had no plans to use (he clat.i to
rate providers, or to release
such information.
I fe said there are discussions
about how to improve the sur
veys, which are already available
at the click of a computer mouse
or the dialing of a phone.
"Everything is in the plan
ning stages." Ashkena/ said. "To
talk details is premature."
Sculh was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
I he government does not
even have an internal ratings
system, but there are plans to
keep a closer watch on
providers suspected of fraud,
Ashkena/ said.
"At no point have we ever
done a scorecard." he said.
Ihe agency's responsibili
ties include oilier lcdeial
health insurance programs for
poor children and families,
serving a total 74 million
Americans.
In recent years, Congress
has foe used on trying to add a
prescription drug benefit to
Medicare, as ni.inv new medi
cines have been found effective
in keeping seniors healthy and
out of lengtln and expensive
hospital stays.
