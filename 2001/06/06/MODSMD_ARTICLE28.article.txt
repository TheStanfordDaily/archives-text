# Students face eating disorders
## Anorexia, bulimia plague over 8 percent of Stanford students 
### JESSE FONNER 
Female eating disorders, including
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, have
been on the rise lor the past three decades, ac
cording to recent research. Even with in
creased awareness, the number of cases con
tinues to climb, and this trend of unhealth)
body image is not absent ai Stanford.
In an anonymous survey of 85 female stu
dents at Stanlord I niversity, 50.5 percent of
all panic ipants s.iid that they were dissatisfied
with their bodies, while 8.23 percent said they
suflered from an eating disorder and 12.9 per
cent said they control their weight by vomiting,
skipping meals or taking diet pills. But what is
pushing .ill these women to lose weight?
When women develop an obsession with
food, weight and appearance, it c an become a
full-blown eating disorder. Statistic son eating
disorders released from the National Associa

tion ol Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Dis
orders show that ".is mail) as 7 million
women sutler from eating disorders."
In addition, a Universit\ ol 'Arizona stuch
shows that hall of all elementary school gills
"tried to lose weight in the past year. I hese
girls weren't simply dieting, lwenty-fout
percent reported skipping meals; I 1 percent
took laxatives or diet pills; and nearh seven
