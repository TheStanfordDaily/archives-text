# Charity accepts bikes, computers
## 
### KEITH PROCTOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting next week, departing
students who no longer need
their bikes or computers can do
nate them to Giving lor tomor
row, <1 student community service
pilot project founded earlier this
spring to give bikes and comput
ers to needy families living in
communities around Stanford.
I he group will be collecting bikes
and computers in the 1 residder
Parking l.ot from I 1 a.m. to 2
p.m. on June 14 and from 10a.m.
to 2 p.m. on |une IK.
"When you see the U-llauls,
that'll be us,' said junior Wesley
Yeo, foundci and current presi
dent of Giving lot lomorrow.
Giving for l omorrow is coop
erating with two community
partners to ensure that donated
items reach families who need
them most. Donated bikes will be
given to the Boys and Girls Club
of the Peninsula, a group th.it ,it
tempts to provide Peninsula chil
dren ages six to 1 8 with ent it hing
social, academic and activity
based programs after school. Do
nated computers will be given to
Plugged In!, a group that oper
ates ,i computer lab for use by res
idents ol Kast Palo Alto.
I he concept of Giving for lo

morrow occurred to Yeo last
summer, after I lis brother came
home from college, he said.
"My brother brought Ins com
puter home, but it just staved in
the box," Yeo said. He thought
that many seniors, who no longci
have use lot outdated computers
or old bikes might have the same
experience. "It's such a waste,"
Yeo said. "We're surprised that
no one lias done tins beloie. I lie
solution seems very obvious."
Alter Yeo returned to school,
he recruited seveial like-minded
friends to get the organization
going. While the group alieacb
had a membership, .i purpose
and a motto — "... because one
man's )iiuk is another man's trea
sure" — the group still had to ob
tain the approval ol the ()lli< e of
Student Affairs.
... '.'lt was really hard getting it ap
proved because there was.i lot of
dead time," said junioi lonnie I so,
a member ol (living for I otnorrow.
However, group approval
wasn't the onl\ hurdle that Giv
ing lor l omorrow had to over
come. I he group requeste d dis
cretion, u\ funding from the I n
dergraduate Senate, but were le
jected. Yeo attributes the rejec
tion to the senate fating more
fund requests this spring than an
ticipated. With Giving loi 1 <>-

morrow's application lor formal
recognition delayed b\ applica
tion processes, the group was not
able to appl\ for funding until it
was too late.
"It happens, and we weren't
the only group to be rejected, so
it's line. Funding was a problem,
but next vear we'll know the pat
terns." Yeo said. But, for now,
group members are bearing the
costs ol transporting donated
bikes and computers to their
community partners. "We're just
funding it ourselves, from our
c bee kbooks," Yeo said.
While Yeo noted that other
groups have < aved under a
similat funding setback, he attrib
uted his group's cohesion to the
friendships tli.it initial!) brought
the membership together.
But there can be problems start
ing a group, .with friends as well.
"Well, when you have two
friends, you have a Batman and
Robin relationship, but each ol
them thinks they're Batman,"
said |oe kanada, a sophomore
and member of Giving for
I oinor row.
"But Wes is the president,"
I so said ol Yeo. "He basically
tells us what to do."
Yeo rejected any concept ol
group hierarchy, and the others
agreed tli.it group decisions are

made through discussion. Coop
eration and a willingness to share
equal burdens have allowed Giv
ing for lomorrow to survive
early struggles.
"I don't like looking at it as I'm
the president," Yeo said.
" I here's no Batman figure."
Yet, while the group started as
a venture among friends, Yeo
saitl he envisions it becoming
more than this and does not see
the group dying out once the cur
rent membership graduates. He
s.iid he plans to recruit new mem
bers this fall at the ac tivities fair.
"It's not 11ist ,i one-shot deal
that we do this year and next yeai
and that's it," Yeo said. "[Giving
for I omorrowj should become a
Stanford tradition. You give to
Ithe group|, and you give to the
community. Don't let your bike
rust or dump your computet.
Give it to us."
Students interested in donat
ing bikes or computers should till
out a donation form on the orga
nization's Web site
(http://www.st an lord.edu/group
gilt), so the group's members will
know how many donated items to
expect. I hough Giving for lo
morrow happily accepts dona
tions, the group reserves the
right to reject anvthing deemed
broken or otherwise unusable.
