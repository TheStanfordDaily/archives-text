win, the squad finally had the chance to carry out that
one last task.
Before a crowd of 3,505 at Sunken Diamond, the
Stanford players stormed the mound for the second
week in a row, but, this lime, plunged on top of each
other in celebration ol ilit- Cardinal's third consecu
tive College World Series berth and the I.3th in the
school's history.

said of the Cardinal (48-10), which is now 7-0 in
NCAA Regional or Super Regional elimination
games over the past two seasons. "I've been here a
long time and, in 25 years as a head coach, this is as
special as it gets."
Sunday's victory was the sixth time in Stanford's
seven postseason games ibis year that a game was de
cided by one run.
" I he\ hung in there like they have all year, and
somehow we found a way to win," Marquess said.
