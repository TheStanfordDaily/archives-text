( oinmere e, said, "the truth is ofien the line
between the-1 wo opposite extremes. | A film
like this] is constrii( live, sheds a light on the
issue. We ought to have respectful conver
sations around these issues."
Kaufman explained the film's motives.
"Hewlett-Packard is svmbolic of the high
tech economy. We were living to tell a
stor\ that wasn't being told about [the]
high-lec li industi v, to show that there are
models of activism and resistance to the
problems that these industries are creat
ing. It's young activists who are taking the
usks. I heie are so mam voiceless people
and stories | tli.it | don't get told.
"flic fact that an inclustr\ this large
does not have a union is ahsoluteh historic.
I liese are instill it ions that are so politic all\
and economic alb powei fill, li is impossible
to wot k voiu wa\ around them. I he\ spin
I he woi Id," Javade\ said.
I he lilmmakei s emphasized how Stan
lord is involved in these issues. "Kvervonc

.ii Stanford is really implicated because it is
the most closely linked university to tins
high-tech industry. It's really hard at Stan
lord to he critical of I lewlett-Packard when
the Hewlett* and the Packard* are giving
so miK h money to Stanford. Kven when
yon think crilicallv, it's hard to speak open
ly," Kaufman s.iid.
"Stanford is the founding institution ol
the indnsti \. I lewlett-Pac kard was like the
grandpa company. As funding for educa
tion di ives up, the result is more and more
dependence on industries that endow the
campus. We wanted i<> break iliiough the
|m\ili| that high-tcchnolog\ was going to
make evervboch rich who worked hard.
I here .11 e in lite 1 few people who at tualh
have iliai < bance," Snitow said.
"Wh.it kind ol idealism (.111 Hewlett-
Packard represent to a Stanford graduat
ing (lass?" asked Snitow, referring to
Hewlett-Packard's chief executive ofliccr,
( arl\ I'lol nia. who will be speaking at the
upcoming ('.ommenccmcnt ceremom. "A
|( ommcncemcnt] address is supposed to
Ik' inspirational, Kaufman said.
I he st reening was free and open to the
public, li was sponsored !>\ the Svmholi(
Svstems Program, the Haas Centet for
Public Service, the Stanford I .abor'Action
(oalition, the One fast Palo Alto Neigh

borhood Improvement Initiative, the
Stanlord in Silicon Valley Project and the
office ol the Dean for Religious Life.
" I he Symbolic Systems Program want
ed to show this film on campus in part be
cause there seems to be little emphasis
placed on social responsibility in the work
place. especially lot students pursuing ca
reers in the high-tech world," senior Priva
Venkatesan said.
(ieorgia Hudson, from the One Kast
Palo Alto Neighborhood Improvement
Initiative, said, "We are working very close
l\ with Hewlett-Packard to make some
tec hnolog) c hanges, which we need 111 our
communitv. I'd like to make vou aware of
how far we've come, but also ol how lar we
have to go."
|ohn I lassell, the clircc tor of public af
lairs for Hewlett-Packard, delended the
company. "Hewlett-Packard, like other
high-tec It companies, uses temporary per
sonnel.'! Ins is not new, and it'scertainly no
secret. It's .111 industrv-wide practice that
lias been around lor main years, l einpo
rar\ work provides the lii st step in the lad
dei when people want to improve their
j<>l >sand then (areer," he said.
" I cmporan employment agencies can
provide steach employment, at better
ilian-niiniinuni wages, for many people.

These agencies — like .ill companies —
are subject to laws and i nles regulating the
conduct of their businesses, including
wages, and health and safety. Hewlett-
Packard sets high standards lor itsell and
adheres to all applicable laws. We expect
our vendors to do the same, he said.
Hassell was nonetheless open to c riti
cism. "We believe in transparent \. We be
lieve th.it people should be able t< > speak up
and protest. We have a lot <>l critic s. and we
want to listen to them, he said.
" 1 he film rcalh < hallenged m\ views on
Silicon Vallc \. |It | made me see how i idicu
louslv competitive some individuals are,
how tliev seem to gel so caught up in the
high-tech culture lliai ihe\ stop thinking
about people 01 what ihe\ can do Ibi oth
ers," Venkatesan said.
"I think more students should be famil
iar with issues relating to the gentrilicatioti
ol Hast I'alo Alto, which pushes residents
out of their communitv bet a use the\ can
no longer afford to live in their homes of
the last 20 years. I know many individuals
who think of Hast I'alo Alto as just the next
housing market to check oul or are glad
that they finally lore down some ol ihe
homes to make a giant Home Depot. I
iliink they should all see ibis film,"
Venkatesan added.
