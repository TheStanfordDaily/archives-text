to arrest those involved in planning sui
cide bombings and to put .111 end to anti-
Israel incitement.
"No doubt some positive steps have
been taken, but I would say, necessary but
insufficient," said Raanan (iissin, an aide

to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

111 the name of the militant wing of I lamas
and Arafat's Fatah group said the (ease
fire would be respected. But leaders of
I lamas - whose support is seen as vital to
a successful truce - quickly began disput
ing the idea.
"When we are talking about the so
called cease-fire, this means between two
armies," Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Hamas'
spiritual leader, told The Associated
Press. "We are not an army. We are peo
ple who defend themselves and work
against the aggression."
Yassin joined 2,000 Palestinians
marching peacefully in (ia/a to mark the
anniversary of the 1967 war.
I VtiH>nstrators chanted," I lie intefadeh

ther bombings were planned. Hut. he
said, "our strategy and our lactic is to con
tinue resistance, the intefadeh. In .til
means and every where."
"The people." he added, "are con
vinced that this will be an effective mea
sure to persuade the Israelis to leave."
Hamas docs not accept the existence of a
Jewish state.
(ihassan Kliatib, a Palestinian political
analyst who attended a meeting with rep
resentatives of Hamas and Fatah, said
participants "spoke in a way that ex
pressed understanding of the circum
stances that led Arafat to make the decla
ration."
Islamic Jihad, a militant group that did
not attend the meeting, indicated it would
give the cease-fire a chance.
