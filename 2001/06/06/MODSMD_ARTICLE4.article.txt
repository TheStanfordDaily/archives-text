# Professors discuss future of IDPs

### MIKEY LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
()ne of tlic main coin ems about under
graduate education in the last tew years lias
been the issue of interdisciplinary pro
grams. In light of the Hewlett Foundation's
merit million grant lor to the School
of Humanities and Sciences, past concerns
about the programs have been stirred up by
fat uity, especially concerning the allocation
of these new funds within the S( hool.

The main issue
An interdisciplinary program is not a
major, but, rather, «i fusion of two or more
departments to form <i locus. According to
Human Biology Chair Russ Fernald, be
cause these programs are not conventional
majors, they are often considered after other
departments when money is allocated.
"()n top of that," Fernald said, "sustain
ing ,i program is much more difficult than
sustaining a department. YVe must find fac
ulty, and it is sometimes very hard to get fac
ulty to leach IDPs."
In his inaugural address at the begin
ning of this year, University President
John Hennessy said, "Interdisciplinary

study is [an] area where Stanford has en
countered both opportunities and chal
lenges. ()ur successes are dramatic; a large
fraction of our undergraduates choose to
major in interdisciplinary programs, such
as human biology, international relations
and feminist studies . . . Vet significant
challenges remain. Our interdisciplinary
degree programs often appear under
funded; competition between interdisci
plinary fields and traditional disciplines
has sometimes led to difficulty in hiring
and promoting faculty; and occasionally
school boundaries create obstacles to new
programs or collaborations. 1 believe that
such barriers, whether they are to new in
terdisciplinary degree programs or to
cross-disciplinary research collaborations,

prevent us from achieving at our
highest level."
Current controversy
Roger Noll, co-chair of the Pro
gram in Public Policy, said that the
issues surrounding interdiscipli
nary programs are not new. He said
controversy surrounding these pro
grams is the result of conflict be
tween those who oppose the idea of
the programs and those who think it
is one of the University's major
strengths.
"The IDP issue... is part of a
larger problem: the procedures and
standards for reallocating resources
among undergraduate educational
activities," Noll said. "Just [a few
years ago, the School of If umanities
and Sciences] killed a depart
ment — the Fcxxl Research Insti
tute. Likewise, at about the same
time, another IDP was killed —
(Ihildren and Society."
In recent years, the controversy
lias circled around several interdis
ciplinary programs: Science, lech
nology and Society; I-ttin American
Studies; and American Studies,
whic li received only a three-year re
newal, as opposed to a typical re
newal of five years, by the Faculty
Senate. Anthropology was split into
two separate departments and ma

jors. "We can add the merging ot all
the language departments as still
another controversy," Noll said.
At last week's Faculty Senate
meeting, Noll eritiei/ed the I niver
sity tor not adecjnately supporting
the Interdisciplinary Program in In
ternational Policy Studies.
While questions arise over some
interdisciplinary programs, others
undoubtedly have a strong base and
are in little danger of losing their
place. The best example ol'this is the
Human Biology Program, whose
recent eight-year renewal is prool
that the program is one ol Stan
lord's most popular majors.
"Most — but not .ill — I DIN and
departinentscleserve support," V >11
said. "Human biolog\ belongs in
this category because the core pro
duces .1 specially skilled student:
someone who knows the s< ientilic,
behavioral and s<h i.il sc ientilic as
pects ol studying humans well
enough to integrate them produc
tively and usefully in thinking
through a certain class of social and
personal problems that are wide
spread 111 society. Likewise, human
I )i< >l< >gv has t he cledic ated support (»112
several core lacult\. inc hiding .some
Medical School facult\ who other
wise would not be involved in un
dergrad education."
"| 1 lie Program in I luman Biol
ogv I lies | to imbed a fusion ol bio
logical and social sc ienc e."' Fernald
said. "For example, we'll stud\ the
neurobiology ofaddic tion, then dis

sect the s<h i;il aspect of it. We'll
stuch lipids, then examine the so
cial cost ol breast-feeding. We ask
what the biological meaning is in a
social context."
1 luman biologv, Stanford's third
most popular major over the last 10
years, is one of the IS interdisc ipli
nar\ programs that collectively con
ferred 24 percent of the degrees in
the past decade.
According to Fernald, the Uni
versity of North Carolina and Dart
inouih ('.ollege have both decided to
start human biologv progi ams next
year, based on what tliev have seen
at Stanford.
I lowever, the success ol interdis
ciplinary preigrams like human biol
ogv cannot hide struggles laced In
the other programs.
"There is a problem when you
give a part\ and iiolxkK comes,"
said John Brauman, the cognizant
clean lor natural sciences in the
Sc liool ol I lumanities and Sciences.
"I think it's, unfortunate, but it
doesn't make sense to run programs
where there niav be onl\ a few de
grees given per vear."
View from H&S
Russell Bcrman, associate dean
ot nuclei graduate studies in hu
manities and sciences, who is re
sponsible foi all interdisciplinary
program, said he recognizes the
controversy.
"An I DP can be terminated while
there is in >thing that can terminate a

department under.l normal(vc lical
review." Bernian s«iid. "This is a
point of irritation tor some."
Berman indicated tli.it the I ni
versity tern.tins in a situation ol ton
strained resources, so moving
monev will always Ik- difficult.
"IDIN have historically not re
ceived the attention they've de
served from the school. 111 the past
year, 1. along with [Humanities
and Sciences] Dean [Malcolm]
Beasley, have tried to improve this.
We have been able to allocate con
siderable supplementary funding
to IDPs. Niisiswhv Prof. Fernalcl,
tor example, will have about .111
extra $100,000 for human biology
next year. In an era of limited re
sources, tli.it sort of reallocation is
not easy. There are plenty ot de
partments which would rather
have us spend that money on
them, rather than on I DIN."
As for the recent struggles of the
Program in American Studies,
Herman said he is not concerned.
"Let's remember that it did get re
newed." he said. " I hev are actually
going to get more funding next
\ear than [the program] did this
[year]. On the other hand, given
that faculty aren't hired through
I DIN, it is very important that 1 DIN
retain vitality."
IDPs here to stay
I hough it is true that some in
terdisciplinary programs may
feel overlooked and underfund-

Ed, the key to success, according
to Herman, is vigorous faculty
participation.
"It faculty step up to the plate,
mentor students and get involved,
IDPs are likely to thrive," he said.
Evidence points to interdiscipli
nary programs sta\ ing strong 111 the
near future.
"We had .1 very informative | Fac
ulty] Senate disc ussion last month
about how to deal with IDPs," said
Debra Sat/, head of the Program in
Ft hie sand Society. "While there was
some disagreement, there was a ma
jority who stressed how valuable in
terdisciplinary work and research is
to the I niversity."
Brauman said he agreed. "I
think IDPs serve very important
functions. I think that, in [my life
time], the\ will remain an integral
part of the I 'niversity. There are no
suggestions 111 ntv mind that anyone
should expect otherwise."
A lingering question is whether
interdisc iplin.m programs will re
ceive sufficient funding and faculty
resources.
" I hat will always stand as the
conflict," said John Bravman vice
provost foi undergraduate educa
tion and ex-oflicio of the senate.
"Mone\, time and space."
Fernald said he hopes that inter
clisc iplinan programs will continue
to flourish despite such challenges.
"I hope that funding [for IDIN|
will reflect our pedagogical value,"
Fernalcl said.
