()ne of tlic main coin ems about under
graduate education in the last tew years lias
been the issue of interdisciplinary pro
grams. In light of the Hewlett Foundation's
merit million grant lor to the School
of Humanities and Sciences, past concerns
about the programs have been stirred up by
fat uity, especially concerning the allocation
of these new funds within the S( hool.

The main issue
An interdisciplinary program is not a
major, but, rather, «i fusion of two or more
departments to form <i locus. According to
Human Biology Chair Russ Fernald, be
cause these programs are not conventional
majors, they are often considered after other
departments when money is allocated.
"()n top of that," Fernald said, "sustain
ing ,i program is much more difficult than
sustaining a department. YVe must find fac
ulty, and it is sometimes very hard to get fac
ulty to leach IDPs."
In his inaugural address at the begin
ning of this year, University President
John Hennessy said, "Interdisciplinary

study is [an] area where Stanford has en
countered both opportunities and chal
lenges. ()ur successes are dramatic; a large
fraction of our undergraduates choose to
major in interdisciplinary programs, such
as human biology, international relations
and feminist studies . . . Vet significant
challenges remain. Our interdisciplinary
degree programs often appear under
funded; competition between interdisci
plinary fields and traditional disciplines
has sometimes led to difficulty in hiring
and promoting faculty; and occasionally
school boundaries create obstacles to new
programs or collaborations. 1 believe that
such barriers, whether they are to new in
terdisciplinary degree programs or to
cross-disciplinary research collaborations,
