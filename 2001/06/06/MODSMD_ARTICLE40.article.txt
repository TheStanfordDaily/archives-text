"So our hope is not necessarily to
move a pureh ideological agenda but
one thai enjoys bipartisan support and
ideas right 'from the beginning."
Loti also spoke of bipartisanship, but
took Democrats to task for comments
made last week that were dismissive of
elements of Hush's agenda such as the
national missile defense system.
"I've got to make sure that the Amer

dent's agenda, the American people's
agenda, will be considered in the Sen

Lott has called |ellords' move a
"coup ol one," and he issued a memo to
(i<) I * insiders last week that said the
part\ miist "begin to wage war toda\
for the election in 2002. We have a
moral obligation to restore the integrity
of our democracy, to restore by the de
mocratic process what was changed in
the shadows of the backrooms in Wash
ington."
Sen. Joseph l.ieberman, Democratic
vice presidential candidate in the presi
dential election settled last year on a 5-
I vote of the Supreme Court, laughed
at those sentiments.
