## Men's track claims fourth at nationals 
### DAN URBAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Heading into the final two days of
competition with only one point to its
name, the Cardinal rallied in the dis
tance races and the discus to claim fourth
place at the 2001 NCAA Track and Field
C Championships.
Stanford relinquished its national title
— won at Duke last year — to the Ten
nessee Volunteers, who topped Texas
Christian by one point.
Starting Stanford's charge on Friday af
ternoon, sophomore Omer I nan heaved
the discus 190 feet, 7 inches, on his first
throw. It would be his best mark of the
competition, and a mere three inches
short of his career best.
Inan placed eighth, bettering his
seeding by eight places, to give Stanford
one point.
After 1 nan's outstanding performance,
the (Cardinal still had only two points, with
jnst four runners slated to compete in the
800, 1,500 .uul r>,ooo meters, their last
point-scoring opportunities.
Four runners — juniors Jonathon
Riley and Cabe Jennings, freshman Don
Sage and senior Michael Stember — were
all it took to vault Stanford from 39th to
fourth place by Saturday's end.
In the NOO-meter finals, team captain
Michael Stember repeated his fourth
place performance at last year's nation
als, covering the two laps in 1 minute,
47.49 seconds.
Running Friday's last event under the
lights of Hayward Field, Riley thrilled
spectators, passing three of the nation's
top 5,000-meter runners in the last curve
and straightaway to win the event.
Riley overcame fatigue from his
10,000-meter race the previous night — in
which he finished 10th — to post a win
ning time of 13:42.51.
When Alabama's David kimani,
William & Mary's Matt Lane and Califor
nia's Bolota Asmerom quickened the
pace and broke from the main pack,
Riley responded and jumped from be
hind, passing his teammates, freshmen
Grant Robison and Seth Hejny, to latch
on to the new leaders.
As the pace gradually accelerated, Riley
hung with the leaders, then made his
move with 200 meters to go.
Riley had lost to Lane at the Cardinal
Invitational and to Asmerom at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships, but out
kicked both with <i heroic final effort.

"I knew 1 had come too far to not give
it everything 1 had," Riley said. "If I tcxik
the lead and then fell back to fourth, at
least I would have given it my all."
Riley took the lead, but did not fall back
to fourth, winning his first N( IAA title and
making this the second straight year Stan
ford has won the 5,000 meters.
Robison finished seventh in 13:53.13,
giving the Cardinal two points, while
Hejny posted a 13:58.91 for 10th place.
With Stanford competing only in the
1,500 meters on Saturday, the finale of the
four-day meet, middle distance stars Jen
nings, Stember and Sage combined for 17
points in just one race.
NCAA favorite Bryan Berryhill took
the lead in the first 50 meters and never let
go, setting a difficult pace for the other
competitors to maintain.
Sage, the sole freshman in the 1,500-
meter finals, delivered a personal-best
time of 3:30.27 for an impressive fifth
place finish.
"1 didn't have my usual acceleration at
the end," said Sage who overpowered
older, more experienc ed runners at the
end of several races this year.
()ne athlete who did have a strong fin
ish left in him was Jennings, who explod
ed from the back oft he pack in the last lap,
head bobbing and weaving in an all-out ef
fort to catch Berryhill.
I lie substantial distance gap, however,
proved too much to make up. Jennings
finished second in 3:37.5f», while Stember
(3:39.15) and Sage followed at fourth and
fifth, respectively.
"I've got to hand it to Berryhill," Jen
nings said. "1 le'sone tough son-of-a-gun."
Both Stember and Jennings competed
in the 2000 ()lympics in the 1,500 meters,
and starting anew after taking time off
from such an intense training schedule
proved difficult for both of them.
"It's the hardest thing I've ever done in
my life, harder than making the Olympic
team," Stember said of coining back to
track at Stanford.
The two Olympians credited each
other, saving that they could not have
made the comeback alone.
"It's a blessing to be here with Stember
in his last race tor Stanford. If it weren't for
this guy . .. dragging me out to workouts,
I wouldn't be here," Jennings said.
Jennings's and Stember's efforts for the
Cardinal after an exhausting experience
with the Olympics proved invaluable to
Stanford's sue ( ess. |ennings
