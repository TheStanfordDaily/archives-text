### BRIAN DECKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Junior Lauren kalvaria, the Stanford women's
tennis team's co-captain, lost four matches this sea
son. Four. Three were in the regular season, and one
was in the NCAA Singles Finals to her teammate, top
ranked Laura Granville. Kalvaria fell in that match, 6-
3, 7-6, forcing a tiebreaker in the second set. That's it,
though â€” just four losses. And 39 wins.
Kalvaria held the No. 2 position on the team be
hind Granville, a sophomore who also won the 2000
NCAA Singles Championship.
Two years ago, Kalvaria was fourth on the team be
hind Gabriela Lastra, then a fellow freshman. Since
then, Kalvaria has climbed from barely cracking the
rankings to now being ninth in the nation. Farlier in
the season, she was ranked as high as No. 7, but it was
in the postseason that she shined.
In the team championships, Kalvaria was Stan
ford's most consistent player. She knocked off Wake
Forest's 19th-ranked Janet Bergman, 0-1, 0-3, on
May 17. defeated Karin Palme of Arizona State, 0-1,
0-2, the following day, and returned on the 20th to
conquer Florida's 13th-ranked Jessica Lehnhoff, 0-2,
0-3. The sweetest victory came on the 21st in the
championship match, when Kalvaria sealed the title
for Stanford by defeating No. 38 Sarah Riske of Yan
derbilt in a solid 6-2, 6-2 decision.
Kalvaria also found sue cess on the doubles courts,
teaming up with freshman Lauren Barnikow to c re
ate the top-ranked doubles team in the country, a
duo that went 5-0 in the team tournament. The paii
finished the season with a 41-5 record after falling in
the doubles tournament to Florida's team of Lehn
hoff and Whitney Laiho, the duo that went on to win
the championship.
"[Kalvaria] has had an unbelievable season." said
junior co-captain Keiko Tokuda. "She is definitelv an
inspiring individual and has come a long wav, from
freshman year playing No. 4 behind [Lastra] and
barely ranked that year, to the [current] No. 2 posi
tion and essentially N0.2 in the nation."
The economics major's hot play in the postseason
culminated in the NCAA Singles Finals, when she
fought a hard battle against Granville. Forcing a
tiebreaker against Granville, who earlier in the season
set an NCAA record for most consecutive singles vic -
tories, was a strong effort for Kalvaria, especially con
sidering that Granville is her teammate.
"It is hard not to have mixed emotions playing
someone you know," Granville said after the match.
Kalvaria usually took a backstage role to her team's
glory, but even there she met with acclaim. She and
Barnikow were named the Pacific 10 Conference
Doubles Team of the Year, and Kalvaria made first
team all Pac-10.
C)n May 31, Kalvaria and Granville were named to
the 2001 USA Tennis (Collegiate Team, an honor be
stowed upon only 10 other women in the nation. I he
team is an elite training program for the top Ameri
can collegiate tennis players. The honor promises an
opportunity fora professional future for Kalvaria.
