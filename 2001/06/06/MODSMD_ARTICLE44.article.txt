# Seniors leave softball legacy

Two leaders, two seniors to be
missed.
Of the 15 members of the Stan
ford softball team that made th"

pilgrimage to Oklahoma City this
year to play in the Women's Col
lege World Series, two seniors ap
preciated it the most.
Jenni Shideler and Ramona
Shelburne arrived on the Farm
when the Cardinal softball pro

gram was still in its building stages.
There was a brand new field —
now the No. 3 team in the nation
plays in a stadium. There was a sec
ond year coach, John Rittman,
who was declared Pacific 10 Con
ference Co-Coach of the Year this
season. And there was a Stanford
team that had never made it to
postseason play — this year's
squad went to the World Series.
Shideler and Shelburne have
been through many changes in
their four years of collegiate play,
as they have helped build the pro
gram from its early stages to its
present status as a national force.
"The past four years, Ramona
and I have been a part of a lot of
firsts," Shideler said. "The World
Series was obviously the biggest
first, and it was amazing to see the
hard work of so many people come
together and achieve their goal. It
was so special."
The achievements of the past
four years have reflected the time
and effort Shideler and Shelburne
have dedicated — but the team
and the experience as members of
the Softball squad are what have
meant the most.
"Mv teammates will be my

friends forever," Shideler said.
"Honestly, I don't think there is
another program in the country
with a team as close as ours. That
also carries over in to the field; we
have great chemistry."
I licit teammates second the
idea that the relationships and per
sonalities of the team carry over on
to the field.
"Ramona is a hard worker and
will do whatever it takes to help tlie
team," said junior Robin Walker.
"Whethei it be laying her body in
front of the team or reading over a
fellow teammates paper.
The attitude that Shelburne
brings to tlu- lie Id and to lilc is no
ticed by many.
"She cares so much, and every
one on the field can see and feel
that," Shideler said.
I his love for softball makes
Shelburne give her all, she says.
"Kven practice you go out and
tr\ t<» get better; even game takes

you one step closer toward your
goals," Shelburne said. "When you
have a picture in your mind of
what you love in life and what
you're working toward, especially
one like going to the World Series,
it's not hard to motivate yourself to
work at it, to push yourself."
Shelburne has led her team
with hard work lor four years,
while Shideler brings a competi
tive streak to the field that many
say is contagious.
"Jenni has played a huge role
on our team," Walker said. "She
has been so versatile all four years
and a real leader. Jenni leads with
a quiet intensity."
Shideler's intensity landed her .1
starting position all four years at the
Farm. In her freshman campaign,
she immediately made an impact by
named Rookie of the Year, and
starting at lirst base and finishing
the season with the highest fielding
percentage on the team.
No. 24 then moved to right field
in her second year, bringing
height and consistency to the out
field. Finally, she found her resting
plate at third base, where she ag

gressively led her team for her las!
two seasons.
Shelburne has also brought ver
satility t<> the Cardinal, as she has
played .til three outfield positions
in her time on the Farm — three
seasons as an undergraduate, and
one while earning her masters.
Shelburne graduated from
Stanford in three years with a
bachelor's in communication and
will finish her masters in commu
nication this June. Ihe starting
right-fielder has earned numerous
academic awards, including being
named an NFCA ALL-American
Scholar Athlete in 1998 and 1999
and.in Academic All l'ac-10 team
member in 1999 and 2000. Sliidel
er joined Shelburne on the Acade
mic All Pac-lOteam in 2000.
fin! these honors, while they
may reflect many of the hours
Shelburne and Shideler have
spent while at Stanford, will not be
what they remember the most.
"I will miss the moments,'' Shel
burne said. "Like when Sarah Bee
son hit a home run against
Louisiana State in our first game at
I he World Series, or when (Jessica

Mendo/.a] hit me in from second
for (fit* winning run in that game.
1 hose moments, when everything
just comes together perfectly, are
like the greatest highs in the
world."
And Shelburne and Shideler
are no strangers to being the cen
ter of those moments. As Shel
burne recalls, she scored the win
ning run in the first game Stanford
had ever played in a College
World Series. One of Shideler's
spotlights came in the second
game of the series with California
i Ins season. The lead continued to
be challenged by both teams until
Shideler settled the battle with a
towering home run over the right
tenter field fence.
I hese moments of glory stretch
beyond softball. When asked what
her favorite thing about Stanford
was, Shelburne replied, "Stanford
is a place that pushes you to do
your best, to think big."
Thinking big is what Shideler
and Shelburne have done in their
four years at the Farm, and what
they have done for the program
(an only be described as huge.
