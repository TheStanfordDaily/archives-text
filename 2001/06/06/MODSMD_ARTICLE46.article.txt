"The time to focus on c rew really made a dif
ference in the boat's chemistry. We were all there
focused on one purpose," said junior Nate Shuett.
()ne of the team's biggest successes occurred in
the men's varsity eight race, where the unranked
Cardinal finished 12th, beating seven ranked

I he (Cardinal's finish here was one of its best of
the season.

"Everything came together," Scollav said. "We
