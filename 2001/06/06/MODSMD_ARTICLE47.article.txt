Who said you have to Ik- Alex
Kim or (iranville lo become
a tennis star on the Farm?
When sophomores Ravi Sarin
and Rishi Kacker put their heads
together to devise the newly
formed Stanford Tennis (Hub, they
had aspirations to provide a forum
where all people interested in ten
nis could play.
"The purpose of the club is to en
courage people to play tennis and
to give more opportunities for peo
ple to plav tennis," Sarin, a high
s< liool tennis product himself, said.
"We know a lot of people play ten
nis but jusi need the opportunity to
go out and hit and have lun, so out
goal is to revive tennis at Stanford."
Sarin and Kacker, the co-presi
dents of the (lub, (ame up with the
idea \nlicii they found that, aside
from the varsit\ teams, people gen
erally did not have an opportunity
lo play (oinpetitive tennis. I lie(lub
has at l rat led an mild 200 members
in its initial year.
"Kislii «in<l I both played in high
s< hool, and we have a lot of friends
that did .is well." Sarin said. "I low
ever, unless you are on the NCAA
team, there is reallv no opportunity
to pla\ coinpetitive tennis, in tour
naments and si nil like that."
I he dub. which is open to all tin
del gi adiiaic and graduate stu
dents, facult\ and stall, beg,in ofli
ciall\ during spring quarter, but has
been in existence since I.ill quarter.
Sophomore Pamela Sacnger,
the tournament director of the
(lub, said she believes that the rea
son lot the enormous student re
sponse was because of its purpose
to gi\c the entire Stanford com
munity, regardless of ability, an
opportunity to meet people while
plaving tennis.
"We created the Stanford I cu
ius ( lub so that people ol all levels
win > like to plav tennis(an be part of
an organization that allows them to
meet oilier plavet sol their level and
play competitively, or just lor fun,"

Saenger said. "[We are] the first or
ganization to bring together stu
dents. laciill\, stall and alumni who
are all interested in playing tennis,
creating an environment lor them
to meet new people, play competi
tive tennis or just get some fun ex
ercise."
I he club is flourishing after an
overwhelmingly successful tourna
ment two weekends ago. I he tour
nament included brackets dial en
compassed beginner, intermediate
•ind men's and women's advanced
pools. Over 120 people signed up
tobattle tor prizes in c.k h bracket.
Besides quarterly tournaments,
current members have been gath
ering weekly to play in "Serve and
Smash Sundavs," where the club
has the opportunity to use the
I aube Family I ennis Stadium and
the West (lam pus courts lor singles
and doubles pla\. as well as drills.
I he dub lias also implemented
other events, such as Midnight
Mai» h Madness.
In the future. Sarin and Kack
er are planning for improve
ments in the club that (.m make
the Stanford tennis experience
more enjovable.
"We plan to launch on our
Web site- a wa\ for people to line!
hitting partners, clinics and also
a ladder ranking system," Sarin
said. "Many more things are in

the works, too, and we're open to
new ideas, so if people have ideas
or suggestions, we want to hear
them."
" I his club will definitely grow in
many directions, depending on stu
dent interest, Kacker said. "It
seems that some students are inter
ested in simply meeting other stu
dents to play with, while others are
looking for clinics and special
events. So our goal in the coming
year will be to strike a balance and
to accommodate (lie maximum
number of students."
According to Sarin, the club
mainly got its support from the ex
isting offic er core, but hopes to es
tablish a greater reliance on ASSU
.ind outside sponsors like Palo Alto
businesses
Sarin also attributed the club's
success to support from the Stan
lord Department of Athletics.
"The Athletics Department
was kind enough to let us re
serve the Taube courts fora
weekend," he said, "We definite
ly appreciate their support, and
we plan on working with them
and the Stanford tennis pro
gram in the future."
Sarin and Kacker say they hope
to keep club membership free, as all
basic events and even the latest
tournament were all free of charge
this year.
