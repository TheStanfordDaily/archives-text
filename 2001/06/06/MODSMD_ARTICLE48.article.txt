### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter a May 2f> NCAA Regional
loss to Texas that put Stanford one
game away from elimination, ju
niors Scott Dragicevich, Chris
O'Riordan andj.l). Willcox pon
dered an eerie situation: "What if
we don't have practice next
week?"
Losing before Omaha just
wouldn't have seemed right for
the Cardinal's 12 juniors, who in
their three years at Stanford have
never finished a season without
first visiting Rosenblatt Stadium
and the College World Series.
litis time, however, it's differ
ent.
" I his is our team," junior Andv
lopham said. "We get along so
well; it's so much fun that 1 just
want to keep playing with these
guys. It's unbelievable."
O'Riordan became a starter
during last year's run to the cham
pionship game, but even he says
lie believes that, somehow, this
time around is sweeter.
"Last year, I sort of felt like I
was along for the ride," lie said. " I
feel like myself and Scott and
And) and Arik [VanZandt] and
the rest of the juniors are leading
this team."
Willcox says he sees the ju
niors' rise to the head of the se
nior-less Stanford team as a mat
ter of opportunity.
"A lot ol the juniors have finally
gotten some chances this year," he
said, citing the loss of three stand
out juniors and five seniors last
season. " I his year is the year when
t lie perseverance paid off for us."
Kven head coach Mark Mar
quess could not st 1 lie* his emotions
for his young squad as his ()maha
steak-si/ed smile beamed dining
the post-game press conference.
"This team shouldn't be here,"
he said. " 1 his is a young and in
experienced club, but they just
didn't believe that should stop
them. 1 couldn't be prouder of a
group of players."
I hat s certainly high praise

from a man who has won two na
tional titles and over 1.000 games
as t lie (Cardinal skipper for the past
25 years.
"They're our veterans, they're
our juniors, they're our leaders,"
Marquess said. "They're the guys
that are leading the pack at eight
in the morning when we're run
ning or in practice and no one c an
see it."
Fittingly, in the game that pro
pelled the Cardinal back to
Omaha for the third consecutive
season, the juniors did the dirty
work.
O'Riordan, the stalwart leadoff
man, matched a career high with
four of Stanford's nine hits, giving
the Cardinal several scoring op
portunities. Mike Wodnicki struck
out live batters in 3 1/3 innings of
stellar middle relief to hold tlu-

Stanford lead.
The Cardinal got on i lie* board
first with Topham's fifth-inning,
two-run home run to right. Will
cox pic ked up his sixth save of the
season and battled through sever
al trying at-bats with the game on
tht- line.
And Dragicevich's sparkling
diving catch on a rocket-shot line
drive ended the game and sent
the Stanford team into a frenzied
celebration on top of — surprise
— a junior.
"Being crushed under the dog
pile might not have been the most
comfortable thing, but it'sdefiniteh
where 1 wanted to be," Willcox said
of the massive pile of Cardinal jer
seys th.it converged on tin- mound
after Dragicevich's diving grab.

Freshman Carlos Quentin is congratulated by his teammates during the Car
dinal's 3-2 win over South Carolina in the deciding game of the NCAA
Super Regionals at Sunken Diamond last weekend.
Way back in September, virtu
all) no one saw that moment com
ing. Even Marquess voiced his
doubts, s.i\ mg that, belore the sea
son began, he did not even expect
the Cardinal to quality lor a re
gional appearance.
Hut the juniors imagined
things differently, refusing to
( hangc their goal and their post
prac ticc < bant ol "()maha" all
season long.
"Fora lot ol us, this was our
team ibis year, and we wanted to
get back there," I opham said.
"We weren't going to settle for

anything less I oilav was the epit
ome ol our team; we just kept bat
tling. and everyone did something
lor us."
Plaving in the College World
Series "is something out team li.is
(oine to expect," I )iagicevic li s.ml.
"This x'cmi is sweetet because we
knew we weren't picked to win
anything."
Friday afternoon, under the
watchful eyes of none other ili.m
President Ceorge W. Bush, "CWS
Act 111" begins foi the Stanford ju
niors, though it seems like a whole
new show.
"I guess going to ()maha the

get back there," Willi ox s.iid. "But
this one is ours."
