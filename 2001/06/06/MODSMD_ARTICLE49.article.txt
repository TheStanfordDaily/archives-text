### MICHAEL ORME CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When asked alxmt his goals lor his lirst year as
head coach of tfie Stanford men's golf team, |eff
Mitc hell chuckled.
" lo win .1 national championship, of course,"
he said.
His Cardinal squad didn't quite take back the
national title they won in 1991 under seminal
head coach Wall) C.oodwin, but Stanford bucked
many critics' expectations thin year. The ('.ardinal
had main good finishes and qualified i< >1 the 2001
NCAA Championship in Durham, N.C. And,
while Stanford missed the t\vo-da\ cut and tied lor
20th, most polls didn't even expect the team to

make it to nationals.
Stanford started its fall season with a lew bumps.
Some were doubtful that Mitchell could follow
Goodwin's example and lead the team to its lormer
glory. At first, it seemed that the critics were right.
The team finished ninth and 10th in the first two
tournaments. But Stan lord righted itself, notching
its only win of the year at the next week's Fresno
1-exus Classic, following the win with finishes of fifth
and third in subsequent tournaments.
The spring season would hold many more ups
and downs. Stanford started its season with a disap
pointing Kith at the PING Arizona Intercollegiate.
The Cardinal's finishes throughout the season
ranged from third to 21 st. throwing Stanford's post
season hopes into doubt.
"1 usually look at the spring as an opportunity
to advance in the national rankings," Mitchell
said. "Unfortunately, our first couple of tourna
ments in the spring were not so strong. It was a
struggle lor a while."
Stanford entered the NCAA West Regional
Championships, the qualifying tournament for na
tionals, ranked 3(ith, well outside the qualifying top
-30 bubble. The Cardinal had mediocre finishes in
the preceding weeks, including a sixth-plat e finish at
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships. A casual
observer would think that the (lardinal didn't have a
chance of qualifying lor nationals.
Think again.
At the NCAA West Regionals at Try sting Tree
Golf Course in Corvalis, ()re., Stanford shot into sec
ond place the first day and eventually lied lor sixth,
easily qualifying for the NCAA National Champi
onships. flie Cardinal even l>eat out Pac- K) champi
on Southern California, which entered the tourna
ment ranked sixth nationally.
"We played some really good golf at regionals,"
Mitchell said. "The guys worked really hard and
kept really positive attitutes going .ill through the
spring. It paid oil at regionals."
Mitchell got crucial leadership throughout the
season from seniors Alex Aragon, Jimmy I.ee and
Kric Dahlberg. Aragon was selected to the All Pac-10
team as an honorable mention. I lis best finish was a
tie lor third at the Matlock Classic, lx e had three top
-10 finishes and five top-25 finishes, in addition to tak
ing medalist honors at the Prestige.
"| Lee and Aragon] came out in the spring with
some great rounds," Mitchell said.
Dahlberg also contributed to the team through
out the season. Dahlbei g c balked up two top-10 lin
islies and five top-25 finishes this year, including a lie

"I'm realh proud ol the seniors'
ellorts." Mitchell said. "They'll be
hard to rephu e next vear."
Mitchell's underclassmen also
provided support to the team, lie
looks forward to having junior
Philip Rowe and sophomore |im
Scki back next ye.tr to compete.

"Phil was the team's most consis
tent player, and Jim was also a con
sistent performer," Mitchell said.
"I'm really excited about next
year."
Rowe had the team's lowest scor
ing average, carrying a 72.0 average,
and received .111 All-C lonference Sec

was third plat e at the Fresno Lexus

finisher at the NCAA's, lying for

In addition, Roweand Dahlberg
were named Academic All-Ameri
cans at I he NCAA's.
"I'm very proud of them,"
Mitchell said. "It's a greal adden
dum to the year."
Stanford made the trip to Na
tionals for tfie first time since the
1 <)«).">-<)(') season, when then-sopho
more I iger Woods led tlie Cardinal
to a fourth-place finish on the
strength ol his National Individual
I itle. I hat season was the last of
Walh Coodwin's great teams,

which from 1 990-9f> won two Pac
-10 titles and a National titfe in 1994.
Coach Mitchell is fully aware of
Stanford's recent history, and is
looking to equaling the dominance
of CGoodwin's teams.
I know ih.it [Wally] has big
shoes (for me) to fill," Mitchell said.
"In the back of my mind, I know
people are going to compare me to
him. I'm pleased with what we did
this year, but not satisfied. I think
we can turn litis team into one that
rivals the teams from the mid
nineties."
Judging from ibis season's re
• tilts, he has a good start.
