Stanford students do date. In lad, 10
percent of Stanford undergraduates are
currently in committed relationships, ac
cording to a recent Daily survey. And most
of those relationships have lasted for more
than six months.
Hut even Stanford singles see action.
Roughly one in four single students had
had a sexual encounter with someone
within the last month.
"The dating trend at Stanford seems to
be: either someone is 'married' or ran
domly hooking up," said Donovan
Somera Yisrael, commitment health spe
cialist at Co well.
"Way to go Stanford," said sophomore
Andrew Baglino, who has been"in and out

of a relationship" lor the last two years.
"Without <t doubt, the vibe on campus is
that there's no dating. But, looking at
those numbers, it would seem a myth."
Over the last month, almost 7(H) under
graduates, or roughly 10 percent of un
dergraduates, were polled in White Plaza.
Roughly equal numbers of males and fe
males, as well as of all four undergraduate
years, were represented.
Questions ranged from dating status to
frequency of hook-ups to the level of sexu
al activity.
Freshmen date the least, while sopho
mores, juniors and seniors date at about
the same rate. Freshmen are also the least
sexually active. In fact, 'M percent of fresh
men claimed never to have hooked up at
Stanford. Forty-six percent of sophomores
and 50 percent of juniors and seniors have

hooked up with another Stan lord student
within the last month.
"Freshmen are still adjusting t<> college
life," said Yisrael, who delivers the weekly
talk, "Studs, Sluts, Virgins and Wimps," to
houses across campus. "Freshmen are re
establishing themselves and struggling to
break free from their social position in
big! 1 school. It takes lime."
Some students, noting personal experi
ence, said they disagree with the results.
(Catherine Hoffman, a student Health
Peer Resource (.enter counselor, noted
that she hooked up more freshmen year
and that now, as a sophomore, she is in a
committed relationship, 112 (oilman is one of
the bb percent of students who date an
other Stanford student.
