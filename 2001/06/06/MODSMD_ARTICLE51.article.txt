# Coops picks Card highlights
## 
### 
This isn't really my last column. But it's close
enough. I hose of you here this summer will
see a bit more of me in the pages of The
Weekly, and Ill no doubt be roped into writ
ing one of those "alumni perspective" columns next
year about how I used to walk to ( lass in the driving
snow.
For most purposes, though, this is it. 1 would try
to give you some perspective here, to tell you what
sports "mean," why we care so dearly about them,
that sort of thing, but, frankly, I'd rather talk about

me. So I'll lake these last moments
on my soapbox to give you this: the
If) favorite sports moments of my
Stanford career.
I've tried to use some restraint;
the list is rest tit ted to actual sporting
events, to eliminate things like the
Rose Parade or those nice girls from
Wisconsin the night before, lie
aware, though; this list is entirely
subjective and probably rife with liis-

loi i< al inac < uracies, il not outright lies. It's also heavy
on the football and men's basketball because, well, I
like those a lot.
Without further ado:
No. 1") — I he lirst (and only) time I ever finished
both runs in .1 collegiate ski meet. Halfway down my
second run, I (aught «i tip and careened full-speed,
screaming, into <1 crowd of coaches and race officials.
Slowed sullicienth l>\ the collision, I steered back to
the com se and finished. I lighlight-reel material.
No. II — Freshman defender Jenny Silverman's
lirst go.tl in the women's lacrosse home opener 111
I 999. Silverman picked up the ball, made a couple of
moves, .md then shifted into fifth gear and went coast
io-(o,isi with hardh .1 sti(k touching her. F.vie from
"()iit ()l I Ins World" couldn't have made a defense
look sillier.
No. 13— Ihe women's rugby 1999 national
championship. Not that I was there, but 1 was editing
.ti I lie l)ail\ that night and spent two hours on the
phone tr\ ing to find out the score. Finallv, a guy at the
I'riiucton student newspaper called to tell me we'd
beaten the tar out of them. Ilis tone of voice alone
made the whole nighl worthwhile.
No. 12 —Mv first water polo game, a women's
mate h in the spring ol 1998. Mark Madsen was in the
stands and started randomly shouting water polo
terms .it the releree, as in, "That's a two-meter, rcl!
Are vou blind?" Ihe Stanford players were openly
laughing in the pool.
No. II —Kris Weems's 32-point game against
W ashington 111 '98. li was the first lime I've ever seen
.111 athlete realize he couldn't miss. By the end of the
game. Stanford would grab a rebound, and the whole
stadium would start shouting for Weems and make
the .'t-point sign before he even touched the ball.

No. 10 — Jason Collins's 34-point game against
Washington in February. Same as above, except a)
lie's a lot taller, so it was funnier to watch him shoot
the trey, and b) 1 lived with him for two years.
No. 9— Big Game '99. All the usual Big Game
hype, Troy Walters' and I odd Husak's List home
games, plus the first Rose Bowl in !i() years on the line.
This dropped a bit on the list because ol the third
quarter SWAT team invasion — riot shields deflate
the crowd a bit — but it's still probably the most im
portant Big Game win ever.
No. 8 —The Rose Parade. Yeah, I said I wouldn't
count litis, but come on. Over 400 million people
watch the Rose Parade, and the Stanford Band got to
be there. We were playing Twister in the streets in
front of a giant helmet madeol flowers. 1 still can I be
lieve I was part ol this.
No. 7 — Any time Core\ Woolfolk tombed the
ball. I don't watch enough soccer to comment intelli
gently on it, but you didn't have to be Pele to see that,
when Woolfolk got a pass, even plaver on the field
oriented to him, as if he had a live grenade. I he term
"dosing speed" doesn't do him justice.
No. f> — Freshman year, a group of guys from my
dorm went down to watt ha field lio< key game, and all
we did was heckle the referees. None of us knew the
rules, of course. No one reall\ knows the rules to field
hockey. I bis made it exiremeb eas\ to challenge a
call, or protest a non-call whenever the action got
slow. I've rarely had more fun on the sidelines. Still
have no idea who won.
No. 5 — The men's basketball team's \ i( ton over
Arizona in 1999, which clinched the team's first Pat -
10 title since 1903. I his was the first win over Arizona
since I'd entered Stanford, and wresting the title from
them .it home was a defining moment for the Cardi
nal program.
No. 4 — The 100 th Big Game, my freshman year.
Say what you will about safeiv, but a Big (..line with
out a riot just isn't the same. I his remains the only
time I've ever seen ever) seat iu Stanford Stadium
full, and the postgamc celebration rumble / chaos
was completely 1 indescribable.
No. 3— Walking into the Alamodome tor tlu'
Final Four game in '98. Ihe stadium seats over
05,000. Seeing Stanford's name hanging from
rafters in the enormity ol iliai spate gave me chills.
I be whole week in San Antonio was in< t edible, but
that first glimpse stands <>ui as the moment when I
knew it was .ill for real.
No. 2 — The Rose Bowl. What else can you sa\ ?
No. 1 —The Miracle Minnie. I lie setting is famil
iar by now: With 59 seconds left in the 1998 NCAA
quarterfinals, down by six to Rhode Island. Stanford
looked finished. 1 had resigned myself to a spring
break of "Voltron" reruns and f>o-degree Boston


Jeff Cooper
spring days. But Arthur Lee had
different plans, scoring 11 points
m those 59 seconds. I lis strip of
(amino Mobley oil an inhounds
put the ball in Mark Madsen's
hands for the most iamousdunk in
Stanford history, the one tli.it put
the (Cardinal ahead for good.

That day taught me the happy
lesson lhat Hill Buckner crushed us
with in li ain't over'til it's over.
It was magical. It was frenzied.
It was a miracle. I'm privileged to
have been there lor it.

Jeff C.ooper, a senior, would like to
think liis editors, the Stanford Depart
ment of Athletics, all the roadies he\
harassed, all the athletes he's worked
with and his friends and family. It's
been Jim . . .

stands and started randomly shouting water polo
terms .it the releree, as in, "That's a two-meter, rcl!
Are vou blind?" Ihe Stanford players were openly
laughing in the pool.
No. II —Kris Weems's 32-point game against
W ashington 111 '98. li was the first lime I've ever seen
.111 athlete realize he couldn't miss. By the end of the
game. Stanford would grab a rebound, and the whole
stadium would start shouting for Weems and make
the .'t-point sign before he even touched the ball.

No. 10 — Jason Collins's 34-point game against
Washington in February. Same as above, except a)
lie's a lot taller, so it was funnier to watch him shoot
the trey, and b) 1 lived with him for two years.
No. 9— Big Game '99. All the usual Big Game
hype, Troy Walters' and I odd Husak's List home
games, plus the first Rose Bowl in !i() years on the line.
This dropped a bit on the list because ol the third
quarter SWAT team invasion — riot shields deflate
the crowd a bit — but it's still probably the most im
portant Big Game win ever.
No. 8 —The Rose Parade. Yeah, I said I wouldn't
count litis, but come on. Over 400 million people
watch the Rose Parade, and the Stanford Band got to
be there. We were playing Twister in the streets in
front of a giant helmet madeol flowers. 1 still can I be
lieve I was part ol this.
No. 7 — Any time Core\ Woolfolk tombed the
ball. I don't watch enough soccer to comment intelli
gently on it, but you didn't have to be Pele to see that,
when Woolfolk got a pass, even plaver on the field
oriented to him, as if he had a live grenade. I he term
"dosing speed" doesn't do him justice.
No. f> — Freshman year, a group of guys from my
dorm went down to watt ha field lio< key game, and all
we did was heckle the referees. None of us knew the
rules, of course. No one reall\ knows the rules to field
hockey. I bis made it exiremeb eas\ to challenge a
call, or protest a non-call whenever the action got
slow. I've rarely had more fun on the sidelines. Still
have no idea who won.
No. 5 — The men's basketball team's \ i( ton over
Arizona in 1999, which clinched the team's first Pat -
10 title since 1903. I his was the first win over Arizona
since I'd entered Stanford, and wresting the title from
them .it home was a defining moment for the Cardi
nal program.
No. 4 — The 100 th Big Game, my freshman year.
Say what you will about safeiv, but a Big (..line with
out a riot just isn't the same. I his remains the only
time I've ever seen ever) seat iu Stanford Stadium
full, and the postgamc celebration rumble / chaos
was completely 1 indescribable.
No. 3— Walking into the Alamodome tor tlu'
Final Four game in '98. Ihe stadium seats over
05,000. Seeing Stanford's name hanging from
rafters in the enormity ol iliai spate gave me chills.
I be whole week in San Antonio was in< t edible, but
that first glimpse stands <>ui as the moment when I
knew it was .ill for real.
No. 2 — The Rose Bowl. What else can you sa\ ?
No. 1 —The Miracle Minnie. I lie setting is famil
iar by now: With 59 seconds left in the 1998 NCAA
quarterfinals, down by six to Rhode Island. Stanford
looked finished. 1 had resigned myself to a spring
break of "Voltron" reruns and f>o-degree Boston


Jeff Cooper
spring days. But Arthur Lee had
different plans, scoring 11 points
m those 59 seconds. I lis strip of
(amino Mobley oil an inhounds
put the ball in Mark Madsen's
hands for the most iamousdunk in
Stanford history, the one tli.it put
the (Cardinal ahead for good.

That day taught me the happy
lesson lhat Hill Buckner crushed us
with in li ain't over'til it's over.
It was magical. It was frenzied.
It was a miracle. I'm privileged to
have been there lor it.

Jeff C.ooper, a senior, would like to
think liis editors, the Stanford Depart
ment of Athletics, all the roadies he\
harassed, all the athletes he's worked
with and his friends and family. It's
been Jim . . .
This isn't really my last column. But it's close
enough. I hose of you here this summer will
see a bit more of me in the pages of The
Weekly, and Ill no doubt be roped into writ
ing one of those "alumni perspective" columns next
year about how I used to walk to ( lass in the driving
snow.
For most purposes, though, this is it. 1 would try
to give you some perspective here, to tell you what
sports "mean," why we care so dearly about them,
that sort of thing, but, frankly, I'd rather talk about

me. So I'll lake these last moments
on my soapbox to give you this: the
If) favorite sports moments of my
Stanford career.
I've tried to use some restraint;
the list is rest tit ted to actual sporting
events, to eliminate things like the
Rose Parade or those nice girls from
Wisconsin the night before, lie
aware, though; this list is entirely
subjective and probably rife with liis-

loi i< al inac < uracies, il not outright lies. It's also heavy
on the football and men's basketball because, well, I
like those a lot.
Without further ado:
No. 1") — I he lirst (and only) time I ever finished
both runs in .1 collegiate ski meet. Halfway down my
second run, I (aught «i tip and careened full-speed,
screaming, into <1 crowd of coaches and race officials.
Slowed sullicienth l>\ the collision, I steered back to
the com se and finished. I lighlight-reel material.
No. II — Freshman defender Jenny Silverman's
lirst go.tl in the women's lacrosse home opener 111
I 999. Silverman picked up the ball, made a couple of
moves, .md then shifted into fifth gear and went coast
io-(o,isi with hardh .1 sti(k touching her. F.vie from
"()iit ()l I Ins World" couldn't have made a defense
look sillier.
No. 13— Ihe women's rugby 1999 national
championship. Not that I was there, but 1 was editing
.ti I lie l)ail\ that night and spent two hours on the
phone tr\ ing to find out the score. Finallv, a guy at the
I'riiucton student newspaper called to tell me we'd
beaten the tar out of them. Ilis tone of voice alone
made the whole nighl worthwhile.
