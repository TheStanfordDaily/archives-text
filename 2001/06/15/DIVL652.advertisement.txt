This Red Barn is a historic
reminder of where it
began. Years before there
1 « ,
was a world-famous
Stanford University, there
was Leland Stanford's
Palo Alto Stock Farm, the
home of nine world
champions and 30 world
records.
This wonderfully
restored Victorian beauty
is a symbol of Leland
Stanford's zest for
research and excellence.
Around its historic track
Eadwarde Muybridge's
first zoetrope pictures
inspired the film industry.
And decades later the
young geniuses of the
university turned silicon
sand into gold and led the
technology revolution.
Come spend a day at
The Farm. Watch beautiful
animals and athletes jump
and parade and prance
through their exhibitions.
We've got polo and pony
rides, petting zoos and
barbecues, too. Come
celebrate the excitement
and the heritage of the
Red Barn Festival. Get the
dust of history on your boots.
