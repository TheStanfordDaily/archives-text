D°g-B°y Shows Himself
"I just couldn't miss the Enterprise
>a£ Used Car Sale!"
ir C Rumors have been circulating around the Peninsula
for years: Does Dog-Boy really exist? Where does he live?
Are his rabies shots current?
Ending the speculation last week. Dog-Hoy, or"Frit/y"
as he prefers to be called, emerged from the Woodside
Hills. At a press conference held Friday, Fritzy asserted
, 'a that the only thing that compelled him to come out of
A K. hiding was the upcoming used car sale. Fritzy wagged his
\ * tail vigorously as he related his decision.
I used Loan Click to get pre-approved so I could
1 V, just walk in and pick out a great used car. Oh, sure,
there are used cars for sale all over the Bay Area, but this
sale is different. Quality cars maintained by Enterprise, 12-month, 12!<)<>(> mile
service agreement, 7-day buy-back policy and no haggling—l couldn't miss this!"
Reporters peppered Dog-Boy with questions about where he came from,
where he s been hiding and why dogs legs kick up and down when you scratch
their bellies.
He responded with "No comment" to every question that didn't relate to the
Enterprise Used Car Sale.To see for yourself why Fritzy is so excited, get pre
approved online before the sale. Just go to Stanford Federal Credit Union's Web site
at www.sfcu.org, click on the Loan Click icon and fill out the brief application.
I 'pon approval, you may print Loan Click s approval page and bring it with you to
the sale, as proof of your pre-approved status. Oh, and bring along a dog biscuit for
Fritzy.
