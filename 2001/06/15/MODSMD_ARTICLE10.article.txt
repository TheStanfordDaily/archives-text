I liis is why Teach Eor America titles
not make a value judgment when some of

the added commitment and insight to
continue addressing inequities through
leadership roles in education tit in other

Community housing does not
justify Greek housing
I have a couple issues to raise with Zach
Pincus and Chris Montgomery's June (i
guest column ("Greek system unfairly
blamed for problems with the Draw").

I heir main point that Greek houses
are very active in community service is not
in dispute. I think it is very admirable for
Greeks to dedicate so much time, effort
and money to helping the community.
I lowever, is this really a good reason to re
ward these organizations, over others,
with beautiful Row houses?
There are countless other student
groups that are just as dedicated to com
munity service t hat do not expect Row
housing for their philanthropy. What
makes (ireeks' community service that
much more valuable than that of all the
other student groups? I'sing community
service to justify (ireek Row housing does
nothing but belittle the community ser
vice they perform by bringing into ques
tion the true motivations behind their
noble actions.
I lie second point, that selectivity in
other houses — ethnic theme, co-ops and
academic foc us — in the form of priority
would have to Ik- eliminated to make the
Draw "fair," is not well thought out.
First of all, I don't hear anyone com
plaining that he or she did not get into
()kada I louse in Wilbur because he or she
is not Asian. The fact that Greeks are
given prime location and housing is what
is really being questioned. To question all
priority and act as if the Row location has
nothing to do with the controversy is not
addressing the issue. 1 don't think that
many people would seriously c are if Stern
and Florence Moore were where Greeks
were housed.
Second, you cannot compare applying
for priority, which is open to all Stanford
students, to pledging to a (ireek organiza
tion. Priority can be obtained without the
great commitment required of joining a
fraternity or sorority. You are not expect
ed to commit so much of your social life to
get priority at Yost House or Gasa Zapata.
Third, the priority system does not ex
clude anyone from living in a house sim
ply because they do not have priority.
With Greek houses, on the other hand,
if I'm not a member, I would not be living
there.
Though Pincus and Montgomery
point out that, if all the Greek houses were
converted to regular Row houses, the
chance that the average Stanford student
would be able to live on the Row would
not increase very much, I know many who
would appreciate this slight improve
ment. What gives anyone the right to
slightly decrease my chance of living on
the Row because they want to guarantee
their chance of living there?
lastly, my main issue with the Greek

houses is that they are all upwards of 85
percent to 95 percent white. For those of
us who value diversity, it is hard seeing
current Greek houses as anything but
counterproductive. They are the most ho
mogeneous houses on campus, and they
only add to the current homogenous na
ture of the Row. This lac k of diversity
hints the housed (ireek members as well
as the campus as a whole. While there are
always attacks on ethnic theme dormito
ries, which are actually some of the more
diverse houses on campus, no one looks at
(ireek houses as structural c auses of Stan
ford's student segregation problem. 1 he
double standard here is ridiculous.
If Greek organizations spent more
time recruiting minority members and
could truly say that their student makeup
was diverse, then, personally, I would
have no problem with (ireek housing. For
many minorities, joining a white fraterni
ty or sorority whose members are more
than 90 percent white is not a realistic op
tion — just as many whites would feel un
comfortable joining a historically black
fraternity. Minorities — for whom this
matters — as well as Whites who value di
versity, should not be expected to have to
immerse themeselves in a 85 percent to 95
percent white setting just so they can live
in the attractive Sigma Alpha Kpsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Tri Delta and other houses.
To further diversify the Row and the
lives of currently housed (ireeks, I think
th.it there should be a decrease in Greek
housing. And, if there must be an in
crease, to at least improve diversity on the
Row as a whole, the new houses should go
to minority (ireek organizations.

Rally not intentionally hostile
I regret thai Lydia Poon found the May
29 Asian-American Women's Rally to be
negative ("Rally against Asian female
stereotypes 'hypocritically stereotypical'
"), but I refute the claim that there was any
intention of "hostility towards white men"
behind the event.
Stanford Asian American Activism
Coalition is a pan-progressive group that
believes in inclusion and was founded by a
multiracial group of students, including a
white male, who were concerned about
Asian-American issues — including issues
of racial exclusion. It was in the spirit of
community-building and in recognition
of the inseparability of racial / economic /

gender struggles that, for instance, Stan
ford's Mariachi Cardenal played at the
rally.
It is true that certain writers tor Mono
lid expressed views th.it may be consid
ered "extreme" or "separatist," but these
views are not shared or endorsed by the
coalition. Monolid's co-sponsorship of the
event was approved on the condition that
the event would not be hostile or alienat
ing in any way. Rather.it was a celebration
of voice and empowerment and a way to
spread awareness of the diversity of views
in the Asian Pacific American community.
There was, indeed, a large poster at the
event where people could write their
thoughts on the issue of fetishization of
Asian females. We could not, nor did we
want to, censor the ideas expressed, be
cause we wanted to foster a constructive
dialogue. While it is true th.it one person
wrote a negative comment about white
males in general, there were two com
ments beside it that critic ized such a view
as being racist. This, to me, was a fair
forum for people to voice their ideas.
Regardless, 1 thank Poon for her input
and will make sure that such concerns are
addressed more thoroughly in future. I
realize that these issues are very sensitive.

Stanford students not 'hooking
up with someone'
According to The I tally's June (> sex sur
vey ("Sex on the Farm), "roughly 25 per
cent ot single students had a sexual en
counter with someone in the last month."
loiter in the article, this number is broken
down even further, and 1 for one am quite
surprised by the results. According to your
numbers, "57 percent of single females
have hooked up in the past month, while
33 percent of single males have engaged in
sexual activity within the last month."
As a graduate student in physics, I can
offer only two hypotheses for this. Either
some percentage of Stanford journalists
have woefully inadequate training in so
cial statistics, or a large number of Stan
ford students are hooking up, but not
"with someone." Again, as a graduate stu
dent in physics, personal experience leads
me to choose the latter as the likelier ex
planation

If Greek organizations spent more

than 90 percent white is not a realistic op

matters — as well as Whites who value di

immerse themeselves in a 85 percent to 95

Community housing does not
justify Greek housing
I have a couple issues to raise with Zach
Pincus and Chris Montgomery's June (i
guest column ("Greek system unfairly
blamed for problems with the Draw").

I heir main point that Greek houses
are very active in community service is not
in dispute. I think it is very admirable for
Greeks to dedicate so much time, effort
and money to helping the community.
I lowever, is this really a good reason to re
ward these organizations, over others,
with beautiful Row houses?
There are countless other student
groups that are just as dedicated to com
munity service t hat do not expect Row
housing for their philanthropy. What
makes (ireeks' community service that
much more valuable than that of all the
other student groups? I'sing community
service to justify (ireek Row housing does
nothing but belittle the community ser
vice they perform by bringing into ques
tion the true motivations behind their
noble actions.
I lie second point, that selectivity in
other houses — ethnic theme, co-ops and
academic foc us — in the form of priority
would have to Ik- eliminated to make the
Draw "fair," is not well thought out.
First of all, I don't hear anyone com
plaining that he or she did not get into
()kada I louse in Wilbur because he or she
is not Asian. The fact that Greeks are
given prime location and housing is what
is really being questioned. To question all
priority and act as if the Row location has
nothing to do with the controversy is not
addressing the issue. 1 don't think that
many people would seriously c are if Stern
and Florence Moore were where Greeks
were housed.
Second, you cannot compare applying
for priority, which is open to all Stanford
students, to pledging to a (ireek organiza
tion. Priority can be obtained without the
great commitment required of joining a
fraternity or sorority. You are not expect
ed to commit so much of your social life to
get priority at Yost House or Gasa Zapata.
Third, the priority system does not ex
clude anyone from living in a house sim
ply because they do not have priority.
With Greek houses, on the other hand,
if I'm not a member, I would not be living
there.
Though Pincus and Montgomery
point out that, if all the Greek houses were
converted to regular Row houses, the
chance that the average Stanford student
would be able to live on the Row would
not increase very much, I know many who
would appreciate this slight improve
ment. What gives anyone the right to
slightly decrease my chance of living on
the Row because they want to guarantee
their chance of living there?
lastly, my main issue with the Greek

houses is that they are all upwards of 85
percent to 95 percent white. For those of
us who value diversity, it is hard seeing
current Greek houses as anything but
counterproductive. They are the most ho
mogeneous houses on campus, and they
only add to the current homogenous na
ture of the Row. This lac k of diversity
hints the housed (ireek members as well
as the campus as a whole. While there are
always attacks on ethnic theme dormito
ries, which are actually some of the more
diverse houses on campus, no one looks at
(ireek houses as structural c auses of Stan
ford's student segregation problem. 1 he
double standard here is ridiculous.
If Greek organizations spent more
time recruiting minority members and
could truly say that their student makeup
was diverse, then, personally, I would
have no problem with (ireek housing. For
many minorities, joining a white fraterni
ty or sorority whose members are more
than 90 percent white is not a realistic op

force of leaders in this country who have
the insight and conviction to work from
within education, from other sectors such
as medicine and law and at every level of
policy to effect the broad systemic changes
needed to eliminate these disparities alto
gether.
I liis is why Teach Eor America titles
not make a value judgment when some of
out corps members decide to leave the
classroom after two years. When they do
choose to leave, they do so after gaining
the added commitment and insight to
continue addressing inequities through
leadership roles in education tit in other
sectors.
Darling-Hammond's attacks have not
tlissuadetl school districts from hiring our
corps members. Hopefully, they will not
dissuade Stanford's students from joining
our movement. The children growing up
in poverty need you. And we need you to
take our fight for change to a higher level.

Community housing does not
justify Greek housing
I have a couple issues to raise with Zach
Pincus and Chris Montgomery's June (i
guest column ("Greek system unfairly
blamed for problems with the Draw").

I heir main point that Greek houses
are very active in community service is not
in dispute. I think it is very admirable for
Greeks to dedicate so much time, effort
and money to helping the community.
I lowever, is this really a good reason to re
ward these organizations, over others,
with beautiful Row houses?
There are countless other student
groups that are just as dedicated to com
munity service t hat do not expect Row
housing for their philanthropy. What
makes (ireeks' community service that
much more valuable than that of all the
other student groups? I'sing community
service to justify (ireek Row housing does
nothing but belittle the community ser
vice they perform by bringing into ques
tion the true motivations behind their
noble actions.
I lie second point, that selectivity in
other houses — ethnic theme, co-ops and
academic foc us — in the form of priority
would have to Ik- eliminated to make the
Draw "fair," is not well thought out.
First of all, I don't hear anyone com
plaining that he or she did not get into
()kada I louse in Wilbur because he or she
is not Asian. The fact that Greeks are
given prime location and housing is what
is really being questioned. To question all
priority and act as if the Row location has
nothing to do with the controversy is not
addressing the issue. 1 don't think that
many people would seriously c are if Stern
and Florence Moore were where Greeks
were housed.
Second, you cannot compare applying
for priority, which is open to all Stanford
students, to pledging to a (ireek organiza
tion. Priority can be obtained without the
great commitment required of joining a
fraternity or sorority. You are not expect
ed to commit so much of your social life to
get priority at Yost House or Gasa Zapata.
Third, the priority system does not ex
clude anyone from living in a house sim
ply because they do not have priority.
With Greek houses, on the other hand,
if I'm not a member, I would not be living
there.
Though Pincus and Montgomery
point out that, if all the Greek houses were
converted to regular Row houses, the
chance that the average Stanford student
would be able to live on the Row would
not increase very much, I know many who
would appreciate this slight improve
ment. What gives anyone the right to
slightly decrease my chance of living on
the Row because they want to guarantee
their chance of living there?
lastly, my main issue with the Greek

houses is that they are all upwards of 85
percent to 95 percent white. For those of
us who value diversity, it is hard seeing
current Greek houses as anything but
counterproductive. They are the most ho
mogeneous houses on campus, and they
only add to the current homogenous na
ture of the Row. This lac k of diversity
hints the housed (ireek members as well
as the campus as a whole. While there are
always attacks on ethnic theme dormito
ries, which are actually some of the more
diverse houses on campus, no one looks at
(ireek houses as structural c auses of Stan
ford's student segregation problem. 1 he
double standard here is ridiculous.
If Greek organizations spent more
time recruiting minority members and
could truly say that their student makeup
was diverse, then, personally, I would
have no problem with (ireek housing. For
many minorities, joining a white fraterni
ty or sorority whose members are more
than 90 percent white is not a realistic op
tion — just as many whites would feel un
comfortable joining a historically black
fraternity. Minorities — for whom this
matters — as well as Whites who value di
versity, should not be expected to have to
immerse themeselves in a 85 percent to 95
percent white setting just so they can live
in the attractive Sigma Alpha Kpsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Tri Delta and other houses.
To further diversify the Row and the
lives of currently housed (ireeks, I think
th.it there should be a decrease in Greek
housing. And, if there must be an in
crease, to at least improve diversity on the
Row as a whole, the new houses should go
to minority (ireek organizations.

Rally not intentionally hostile
I regret thai Lydia Poon found the May
29 Asian-American Women's Rally to be
negative ("Rally against Asian female
stereotypes 'hypocritically stereotypical'
"), but I refute the claim that there was any
intention of "hostility towards white men"
behind the event.
Stanford Asian American Activism
Coalition is a pan-progressive group that
believes in inclusion and was founded by a
multiracial group of students, including a
white male, who were concerned about
Asian-American issues — including issues
of racial exclusion. It was in the spirit of
community-building and in recognition
of the inseparability of racial / economic /

gender struggles that, for instance, Stan
ford's Mariachi Cardenal played at the
rally.
It is true that certain writers tor Mono
lid expressed views th.it may be consid
ered "extreme" or "separatist," but these
views are not shared or endorsed by the
coalition. Monolid's co-sponsorship of the
event was approved on the condition that
the event would not be hostile or alienat
ing in any way. Rather.it was a celebration
of voice and empowerment and a way to
spread awareness of the diversity of views
in the Asian Pacific American community.
There was, indeed, a large poster at the
event where people could write their
thoughts on the issue of fetishization of
Asian females. We could not, nor did we
want to, censor the ideas expressed, be
cause we wanted to foster a constructive
dialogue. While it is true th.it one person
wrote a negative comment about white
males in general, there were two com
ments beside it that critic ized such a view
as being racist. This, to me, was a fair
forum for people to voice their ideas.
Regardless, 1 thank Poon for her input
and will make sure that such concerns are
addressed more thoroughly in future. I
realize that these issues are very sensitive.

Stanford students not 'hooking
up with someone'
According to The I tally's June (> sex sur
vey ("Sex on the Farm), "roughly 25 per
cent ot single students had a sexual en
counter with someone in the last month."
loiter in the article, this number is broken
down even further, and 1 for one am quite
surprised by the results. According to your
numbers, "57 percent of single females
have hooked up in the past month, while
33 percent of single males have engaged in
sexual activity within the last month."
As a graduate student in physics, I can
offer only two hypotheses for this. Either
some percentage of Stanford journalists
have woefully inadequate training in so
cial statistics, or a large number of Stan
ford students are hooking up, but not
"with someone." Again, as a graduate stu
dent in physics, personal experience leads
me to choose the latter as the likelier ex

Teach for America 'mobilizes our
nation's most talented minds'
in tin 1 national media, Linda Darling-
Hammond lias notion l>\ with protecting
the status (juo 111 teat hct education In
blasting Leach Eoi America, despite not
lia\ mg data to prove her assertions, much
.is she did in the June 1 article ("Debating
' Leach for America' "). I hope I he Daily
will hold her to a higher standard.
In the fall. Leach Lor America will re
lease .1 studv th.it compares our corps
members' suet ess in affecting gains in stu
dent achievement with that of other
leathers. It will be the first time to my
knowledge that an organization that
11 ains teat hei s has measured its effective
ness in tci ins of student performance, and
it will hopefully put an end to this debate
once and for all.
In the meantime, we relv on feedback
fiom the principals and superintendents
who hire our corps members. On an in
dependent biannual survey, an average of
91 percent of school principals rated
corps members as good or excellent on
each of 2.'i indicators of effective teat hing.
Rod Paige, now the U.S. Secretary of Ed
ucation, recently said that, based on his
experience as superintendent of the
Houston Independent School District,
"Every yea!, our best teat hers tame from
I each Eor America."
I he artit le quotes Darling-1 lamtnond
as saving, " What I cat h Eor America says
is that society should not try to make good
011 its promise to African-American and
1 .atino students that they deserve teachers
who are .is qualified as those who leach
elsewhere."
And vet. Leach Eor America's mission
is precisely to mobilize our nation's most
talented minds and most capable young
leaders around ensuring that students
growing up 111 poverty have the opportu
nities they deserve. 1 lie wealthiest par
ents in the country fight to get their stu
dents into private schools where teachers
share the academit qualifications of our
recruits.
We know that good teaching in low-in
come communities is gtxxl leadership.
Successful urban and rural teachers are
individuals with the commitment, drive
and ability to establish .111 ambitious vision
for where they want their students to be,
to motivate their students to achieve the
vision and then to pursue that result re
lentlessly, 111 spite of all the challenges and
obstacles that come in their way.
I his is why Teat h Eor America's rigor

ous selection process admits only those
candidates who have strong leadership
characteristics; we select just one in four
candidates on average. At the same time,
knowing that classroom suet ess requires a
strong base of teat hing skills, we invest in
intensive pre-servite training and ongo
ing support. Thanks in good part to feed
back from our < ritically thinking, rightful
ly demanding corps members, our ap
proach has bet time stronger and stronger
over time. And while we continue to im
prove our approach each year (much as
we hope any school of education would
tlti), we know that 95 percent of our corps
members say .it the end of their two-year
commitments that they would join l each
Eor America .ill over again.
By the time they are nine years old,
children in high-poverty areas are already
three to four grade levels behind children
in high-income areas 111 reading ability,
and tli.it gap only gets wider as the chil
dren grow older. In light of these dispari
ties, Teach Eor America believes it is im
portant, but not sufficient, to provide
more excellent teachers in urban and
rural areas. In addition, we must build a
force of leaders in this country who have
the insight and conviction to work from
