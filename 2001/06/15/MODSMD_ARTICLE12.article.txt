# UNBUTTONING EAST COAST TRADITIONS
## 
### 
DANA MULHAUSER

For a buttoned-up girl from a but
toned-up East Coast town, Stan
ford meant wide-open spaces. Cal
iibrnia was, for me, a sun-flecked
Atlantis where the familiar constraints 1
grew up with, like my winter coats, could
be shed. 1 came here not to run away from
where 1 grew up, but to gain a little wiggle
room for myself.
This is not to say that my childhood was
anything less than pleasant, stimulating
and quite normal. But I had an impulse to
get away.
I'm guessing this won't make much
sense to Californians. For my West Coast
classmates, Stanford is not an escape so

much as a haven, a chance
to get a good education
without being subjected to
East Coast winters. In
state, Stanford is viewed as
a nerd school, and proud
ly so, but it is not ground
zero for the cause of libera
tion.
But from far away.

Stanford is exotic, the Aruba of the Peter
son's Cuide to (x)lleges. It means new ar
chitecture, new plants and new people
(who. if the brochures are to Ix- believed,
smile ceaselessly).
So I crossed the country, not only to

learn, but to unlearn. To get away from
everything that so gently protected me:
my family, my friends, my home and my
confident familiarity with the local geogra
phy. 1 found that Stanford is indeed a
wide-open space: physically, academically
and socially, and 1 treasure the freedom it
gave me. While I'm proud of everything 1
learned here, 1 appreciate Stanford at
least as much for the things it never taught
me.
I never learned to spend all weekend
studying it the sun was shining. I never
learned how to stress about grades, and 1
never learned how to fuss over my (1 PA.
1 never learned that driving is better

than biking, or that biking is better than
walking, or that walking is better than
lying in the grass.
1 never learned to like tofu.
I never figured out a convincing reason
to take statistics, or chemistry, or post
modern literature.
1 never learned to ride a bike with no
hands, which is probably fortunate, given
that 1 also never learned to wear a helmet.
1 never learned to say "the 101" or "and
she was a11..." or "hella cool."
1 never quite admitted to my friends
back home that it isn't 70 degrees and
sunny every day here.
1 never learned that schoolwork must

In- unpleasant to Ik- worthwhile, or that
reading must bediflicult to lx- meaningful.
I never enjoyed reading K.mt.
I never learned to sit quicth in .11 lass
room without raising my liand. or 10 have
implacable faith in my elders.
Now, sated with sunshine and lessons
unlearned, I am returning to the town
that instinct still (alls home. I doubt that
my wanderlust is quenched, but I have
had a taste of wide-open spaces, and I have
many lessons still to forget.
