# WANDERING OFF THE PATH
## 
### 
RITU BHATNAGAR

I was a fourth-grader on a local field
trip to Stanford when 1 firmly an
nounced: "I'm never coming here
again." Much of this hasty decision, I
think, had to do with the fact that 1 re
mined from the trip with a nasty case of
poison oak. Curious about the surround
ings, 1 had strayed a bit from the path we
were hiking on to the Dish and somehow
managed to rub elbows with an unfriend
ly plant. I didn't return to the Dish until
about 10 years later, when, on a freshman
dorm expedition, 1 reluctantly went along
with my dormmates into the Foothills.
This time around, though, 1 stuck res
olutely to the path.
Other than Dish explorations, though,
1 don't think I would characterize any of
inv other Stanford experiences as sticking
to "the path." I've purposefully tried out

various avenues that have
meandered back and
forth between different
majors, careers and inter
ests. And never once have
1 been penalized for exer
cising curiosity.
The process of ques
tioning everything I en
counter is what I've be-

come acquainted with at Stanford. Mostly,
I think, I've been prompted to pose ques
tions because of the diversity of answers 1
could always anticipate, even from a small
collection of people on this campus. In ef
fect, Stanford has provided me with the es
sential training that 1 will need .is I venture
out into the world of journalism.
But thinking about leaving Stanford
— even though it's to work in a field I'm

so excited about — lias been something
I've avoided for the last couple of weeks.
Somehow, I've had the strange notion
that, if I don't think about graduation, I
won't have to leave a place I've grown so
attached to.
But now tli.it I'm left with just a couple
ol days before graduation, I'm wondering
how to begin this process of reflection -
how to think about the past couple ofyears
and plan for what post-graduation life
may be like.
I think 1 may have chanced upon a so
lution this week, as I started the long and
tedious project of cleaning out my room,
and found .i stash of film rolls that I never
got around to developing. 1 shot some of
these rolls as far back as my freshman year.
(I'm in dire need of a Polaroid, or, better
yet, a digital camera. Those of you who

haven't yet bought graduation presents,
take note.)
Most of these photos, I know, are of the
amazing people I've met along the differ
ent paths I've taken, whether through the
activities I've been involved in, the ( lasses
I've been drawn to or the dorms I've lived
in. I am finally going to get all of these rolls
developed, and lay them all out on the
floor - not in chronological order - so that
I can look at each individually, as a piece of
my Stanford experience.
This idea was inspired by one of the last
papers I'll ever do at Stanford, on author
Georges Perec's "W or The Memory of
Childhood." Perec's narrator diligently
studies certain photographs from his past
as a way to learn more about himself and
the parents he never knew. But the pho
tographs hardly compare to the snippets

of memory he does have - those bright,
fleeting images in the mind that are able to
convey the emotion and sensation of expe
rience.
1 know it will Ik- the same for me, when
1 finally get these photographs developed
and look at them as pieces of mv past. I he
images in the photos will be lieautiful. But
they are only reflections of the deeper
memories that 1 will earn with me always.
Thank you, Stanford.
