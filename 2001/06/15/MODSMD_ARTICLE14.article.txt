# BRAVING THE 'REAL WORLD'
##

ALEX PASCAL

Thai familiar phrase lias crept
back into the conversational lex
icon. Though thrown my way
off and on since 1 officially he
came a senior last June, it has come on
strong in recent weeks. It always does this
time of year.
I remember hearing it for the first time
as my graduation from high school ap
proached. A teac her or a family friend
would sidle up lo me and, with a wink, a
hollow laugh and perhaps a slap on the
back, ask, "How does it feel to be joining
the real world?" Although 1 believed I had
escaped the uncomfortable phrase after
high school by going off to college, it has
nevertheless returned with a vengeance.
At least the question seemed more ap
propriate four years ago. Indeed, the vast
majority of seniors graduating this week
end would attest that the transition from
high school to college was rather dramat
ic. I journeyed from the friendly confines
of suburban Boston and an all-boys prep
school of less than 300 students ac ross the
country to Stanford in all its immensity
and diversity-on my own for the first time.
I have no doubt that most of us can relate
similar pioneering tales as well.
What bothers me about the anxiety
provoking phrase, "the real world," at the
moment, however, is its implication that

our experience over the
past four-plus years at
Stanford was somehow
unreal or idyllic.
To be fair, even beyond
the conventional
metaphor of academia as
an Ivory lower standing
apart from the rest of the
world, Stanford de-

serves its moniker as a bubble. I he weath
er, the scenery, the campus culture - they
all contribute to isolating this place and its
population from the outside world.
Furthermore, I'll admit that college is a
pretty good deal. Its freedom and flexibil
ity, at least compared to most of the work
ing world, remains unparalleled. 1 fere, we
c an pretty much do what we want when we
want: party on a whim, study whatever
strikes our fancy each quarter, get in
volved outside the classroom or just sleep
through the day. Trust me when 1 say that
you would be hard-pressed to find a job
that allows you to sleep past noon on a reg
ular basis. (Right now, bartending and
freelance writing sound like stellar career
options, don't they?)
Of course, Stanford differs from the
"real world" in many respects, but not .is
much as we might expect if the phrase
didn't hint at such stark contrast. If we just

stop to consider what our daily lives at this
university actually consist of, Stanford be
gins to look remarkably similar to the "real
world." Four years ago, we arrived in a
new place and met .111 array of new people.
We had to learn to navigate both ,1 strange
institution and an unfamiliar social situa
tion. Since Orientation, for better or
worse, Stanford has become a home re
plete with .ill its benefits and drawbacks.
During this same period, the individuals
we encountered along the way are now ei
ther friends or adversaries, affable or un
pleasant aquaintances, or simply forgotten
faces. Such is Stanford. Such is life.
Surviving and excelling in this place has
required the same skills tli.it will enable us
to endure and thrive beyond Campus
Drive. Academic, social and extracurricu
lar obligations and opportunities have
forced 11s to budget our time as well as our
checkbooks. We have learned by neccessi
ty to juggle a wide variety of personal and
professional relationships such that the
balls frequently seem on the verge of top
pling down. Attempting to strike the right
balance in the eternal struggle between
work .incl play has resulted in more late
nights and early mornings than we care to
— or perhaps even can — remember.
And then there's the bureaucracy we have
confronted time and time and time again,

whether paying bills, petitioning classes,
trying to get services, contesting some
bizarre kind of snafu, applying to gradu
ate (and hopefully succeeding) and so on.
Sounds like the real world to me.
Yet as much as Stanford has demanded
of us, we have also asked of it. In coming to
this university, we sought everything
under the brilliant (lalifbrnia sun: intellec
tual stimulation, career advancement, en
during friendships, great lovers, winning
athletic teams to root on, effectual organi
zations to serve, an exciting and fulfilling
social life, the chance to pursue a passion
or realize a dream, the chance to discover
more about ourselves and our environ
ment. Certainly, 110 one has gotten every
thing he or she desired. But I would bet
that, individually, we have managed to
achieve a substantial portion of what we as
pired to accomplish from the outset of col
lege by virtue of exploration, determina
tion, and/or dumb luck. Indeed, Stanford
has provided a wealth of opportunities.
Some we have aggressively chased, while
others have fallen unpredictably into our
laps. The circumstances from which we
have profited, suffered and learned — in
tentionally or not — are what I suspect the
"real world" is all about.
In the final scene of "The Graduate,"
having just escaped from the church, Ben-

jamin and Elaine are seated .it the hack <>l
a bus whose destination they do not know
This scene has become mv favorite in .ill ol
film, not because of anv ac tion that oct ins,
but rather due to t lie enigmatic cxprcssic >11
on Ben's face. It can best be described as a
half-smile that not only resembles the
Mona Lisa's in form, but rivals it in terms
of mystery as well. 1 like to believe that
Ben's peculiar smile proceeds from a
blend of the determined confidence lu
lus developed in himself ;is a result of Ins
past experience and the insecuritv he fee ls
heading into the nnkown. !he fad re
mains that no one of us ( .in predict what
lies ahead for sure, but we should not suf
fer the anxiety associated with entering an
utterly different world because the expel 1-
enceof the past four years has prepared us
to face life beyond Stanford.
So, this weekend, when people ask you
about joining the "real world," don't hesi
tate to give them a wink, a smile and .1 slap
on the back as you answer: "No worries.
Been there, done that."
