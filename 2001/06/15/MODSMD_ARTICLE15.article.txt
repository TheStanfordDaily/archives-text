# AN EXISTENCE PERPETRATED
## 
### 
JEREMY KANE

A marionette of late, Oedipus
never inhaled a fresh breath of
freedom, never drifted in the
current of free will, until one
ecstatic moment when lit- stood on the
precipice of destruction.
Warned by a prophecy that his son
would kill him and marry his wife, Oedi
pus' father religiously abstained from sex
with his wife until a lit of drunkenness
subverted his diligence. When Oedipus
was finally born, his frightened parents
pinned his feet together and left him to
(lit- of exposure. Many years later, after
fate delivered him, tortured and desper
ate, to the point of existential recognition,
lie faced the first uncontrolled, unfated,
free act of his life. And he used it to blind
himself in a fit of recognition, in a fit of
despair, in a moment of life.
This man's story excites me for its
agony, for its despair, for its hope. Here,
I find our hero — here is a hero in an age
when the hero is dead, choked in the oily
grip of compromise and acceptance. I see
a chance.
At a time of much optimism, of unbri
dled hope for the future, Oedipus'
demise should be remembered for what
it projects — the indomitable guiding
light of recognition sweeping through
the surrounding night of acceptance.
Admittedly, Oedipus is a curious
choice fora hero when so many other an
cient characters appear better suited:
Penelope was loyal; Achilles, brave; Abra

ham, obedient till death;
Peter, the father of the
Church. But Oedipus,
the chaotic hero, the trag
ic figure, represents
every person at some ag
onizing moment of life.
Realize this: Each of us at
some point will, or has,
held the throbbing pins

of recognition in our trembling hands
and threatened action — but why have
we dropped the pins clanging to the
floor? Why have we cried out in question
to the Lord, "Why hast thou forsaken
me?"
1 return to the myth that has been de
graded to the point of sexual innuendo,
praised as the greatest tragedy ever pro
duced and mimicked till even cliche has
lost its glossy imprimatur. However,
()edipus interests me not for the structure
behind his story, or even for the twisted
crank of fate groaning from beyond;
Oedipus delights me as the drastic hero,
the courageous warrior caught in the bat
tle between action and adumbration.
A Greek poet wrote, "Appearance
overpowers truth and controls happi
ness." We can discard happiness as an an
cillary predicament that we should each
address in our own private spaces and
not waste our time on here. But ()edipus'
heroism lies in his conquest of appear
ance and discovery of truth.
Nothing was as it seemed for Oedipus:

He unknowingly committed patricide
and incest and infested Thebes with the
plague of his own crimes by trying to do
good. His life was a crude juxtaposition of
appearance and reality. But though the
prophecy was finally fulfilled, the ab
solute beauty lies in his anagorisis (recog
nition), which was a consequence of his
pursuit of truth, of knowledge.
Kxamine the circumstances of the
story and you will find the certitude of
commonality. Kach of us has pursued
knowledge in our ways — through
books, papers, politics, conversations, re
ligion, faith. The quest for knowledge is
what drives life and what ultimately
weighs down the hero in a trick of Her
culean irony.
lu his pursuit of truth, Oedipus un
covered the consequences of his life; in
one brief interlude, as the forces of fate
converged around him, he discovered
that he had killed his father, the king, had
become husband to his mother, and was
the putrid miasma cursing the city.
Fate, in motion before his birth, deliv
ered Oedipus to that moment when his
faith withered in the afternoon sun of de
spair. Hardly the undoubting, Abraham
it pawn faithfully following the directives
of another, Oedipus was devoid of faith
as he stood before the altar of fate. He
knew only a past that had destined him to
destroy his family and city. This was the
moment in his life when he became fully
aware of his actions, recognizing his

plight and directing his rebellion with
each drastic movement he made.
But, when recognition seized him by
the throat, he did not commit suicide, as
his mother did. Rather, with repeated
jabs to his eyes, C )edipus constructed faith
in himself, faith in his own survival — he
spared his life. Desperately hopeful, he
realized then that true despair lay not in
blindness but in acceptance and became
what lie had not been: free.
Oedipus was judge, prosecutor, de
fendant and witness in his own trial, and
he shirked none of those duties. In retri
bution for his own crimes, he sought
vengeance only on himself, thrusting his
mother's pins into the soft flesh of his
eyes, blocking out the cruelly fated world,
the world that left no thread unattached
to the needle of fate except this, his first
unadulterated moment.
At every other moment in his life,
Oedipus was fully cognizant of a greater
force in life, that there was something be
yond himself — the prophecy, the
plague, the Sphinx — something to
struggle against. But the moment after
he found his mother dangling from the
ceiling, the moment of recognition when
he could no longer deny fate or his role in
it, the moment when he discovered that
the struggle was now with himself, this
was where fate delivered him: the heroic
moment.
Oedipus should not be considered a
hero for his efforts to save the city from

the Sphinx. Oedipus recognized his
faults — life's cruel absences, life's de
spair — and saw dearly his pearl tower,
which had crumbled into the pile ot shit
that had gathered .it its base, and he < ried
out, as Faust did, "Woe! Woe! Thou hast
it destroyed, the Beautiful world; with
powerful fist; in ruin 'lis hurled," and still
he continued. This was the moment
when he became heroic, when he failed to
accept as acceptance relentlessly serenad
ed him with its Sirens' call; tliis was ()edi
pus when he ripped the golden pins from
his mother's robe; this was the moment ot
hope. Here is a man who would blind
himself , who would see, who would know
in the awful act of self-inflit ted blindness.
Consumed by fate, harangued bv the
invisible sentence gaveled long before his
birth, Oedipus recognized and acted.
Oedipus should remain with pins in his
hands — the broken man acting, without
appearance, with knowledge, with fate.
Although much befalls ()cdipus, we must
join him as he stands before his dangling
mother, pins in his hands, choosing. I his
is Oedipus as a being, a hero, beautiful.
With the thrust to his eves, he recognized
that he was the pawn of fate, of the ab
surd. and he righted the course of his life
with one brave act of freedom. Oedipus
had faith, Oedipus was free.

Jeremy Kane will graduate with a degree in
elassies ami belteves that behind every beautif ul
thing there lurks some sort of pain.

ligion, faith. The quest for knowledge is
what drives life and what ultimately
weighs down the hero in a trick of Her
culean irony.
lu his pursuit of truth, Oedipus un
covered the consequences of his life; in
one brief interlude, as the forces of fate
converged around him, he discovered
that he had killed his father, the king, had
become husband to his mother, and was
the putrid miasma cursing the city.
Fate, in motion before his birth, deliv
ered Oedipus to that moment when his
faith withered in the afternoon sun of de
spair. Hardly the undoubting, Abraham
it pawn faithfully following the directives
of another, Oedipus was devoid of faith
as he stood before the altar of fate. He
knew only a past that had destined him to
destroy his family and city. This was the
moment in his life when he became fully
aware of his actions, recognizing his

plight and directing his rebellion with
each drastic movement he made.
But, when recognition seized him by
the throat, he did not commit suicide, as
his mother did. Rather, with repeated
jabs to his eyes, C )edipus constructed faith
in himself, faith in his own survival — he
spared his life. Desperately hopeful, he
realized then that true despair lay not in
blindness but in acceptance and became
what lie had not been: free.
Oedipus was judge, prosecutor, de
fendant and witness in his own trial, and
he shirked none of those duties. In retri
bution for his own crimes, he sought
vengeance only on himself, thrusting his
mother's pins into the soft flesh of his
eyes, blocking out the cruelly fated world,
the world that left no thread unattached
to the needle of fate except this, his first
unadulterated moment.
At every other moment in his life,
Oedipus was fully cognizant of a greater
force in life, that there was something be
yond himself — the prophecy, the
plague, the Sphinx — something to
struggle against. But the moment after
he found his mother dangling from the
ceiling, the moment of recognition when
he could no longer deny fate or his role in
it, the moment when he discovered that
the struggle was now with himself, this
was where fate delivered him: the heroic
moment.
Oedipus should not be considered a
hero for his efforts to save the city from

the Sphinx. Oedipus recognized his
faults — life's cruel absences, life's de
spair — and saw dearly his pearl tower,
which had crumbled into the pile ot shit
that had gathered .it its base, and he < ried
out, as Faust did, "Woe! Woe! Thou hast
it destroyed, the Beautiful world; with
powerful fist; in ruin 'lis hurled," and still
he continued. This was the moment
when he became heroic, when he failed to
accept as acceptance relentlessly serenad
ed him with its Sirens' call; tliis was ()edi
pus when he ripped the golden pins from
his mother's robe; this was the moment ot
hope. Here is a man who would blind
himself , who would see, who would know
in the awful act of self-inflit ted blindness.
Consumed by fate, harangued bv the
invisible sentence gaveled long before his
birth, Oedipus recognized and acted.
Oedipus should remain with pins in his
hands — the broken man acting, without
appearance, with knowledge, with fate.
Although much befalls ()cdipus, we must
join him as he stands before his dangling
mother, pins in his hands, choosing. I his
is Oedipus as a being, a hero, beautiful.
With the thrust to his eves, he recognized
that he was the pawn of fate, of the ab
surd. and he righted the course of his life
with one brave act of freedom. Oedipus
had faith, Oedipus was free.

A marionette of late, Oedipus
never inhaled a fresh breath of
freedom, never drifted in the
current of free will, until one
ecstatic moment when lit- stood on the
precipice of destruction.
Warned by a prophecy that his son
would kill him and marry his wife, Oedi
pus' father religiously abstained from sex
with his wife until a lit of drunkenness
subverted his diligence. When Oedipus
was finally born, his frightened parents
pinned his feet together and left him to
(lit- of exposure. Many years later, after
fate delivered him, tortured and desper
ate, to the point of existential recognition,
lie faced the first uncontrolled, unfated,
free act of his life. And he used it to blind
himself in a fit of recognition, in a fit of
despair, in a moment of life.
This man's story excites me for its
agony, for its despair, for its hope. Here,
I find our hero — here is a hero in an age
when the hero is dead, choked in the oily
grip of compromise and acceptance. I see
a chance.
At a time of much optimism, of unbri
dled hope for the future, Oedipus'
demise should be remembered for what
it projects — the indomitable guiding
light of recognition sweeping through
the surrounding night of acceptance.
Admittedly, Oedipus is a curious
choice fora hero when so many other an
cient characters appear better suited:
Penelope was loyal; Achilles, brave; Abra

ham, obedient till death;
Peter, the father of the
Church. But Oedipus,
the chaotic hero, the trag
ic figure, represents
every person at some ag
onizing moment of life.
Realize this: Each of us at
some point will, or has,
held the throbbing pins

of recognition in our trembling hands
and threatened action — but why have
we dropped the pins clanging to the
floor? Why have we cried out in question
to the Lord, "Why hast thou forsaken
me?"
1 return to the myth that has been de
graded to the point of sexual innuendo,
praised as the greatest tragedy ever pro
duced and mimicked till even cliche has
lost its glossy imprimatur. However,
()edipus interests me not for the structure
behind his story, or even for the twisted
crank of fate groaning from beyond;
Oedipus delights me as the drastic hero,
the courageous warrior caught in the bat
tle between action and adumbration.
A Greek poet wrote, "Appearance
overpowers truth and controls happi
ness." We can discard happiness as an an
cillary predicament that we should each
address in our own private spaces and
not waste our time on here. But ()edipus'
heroism lies in his conquest of appear
ance and discovery of truth.
Nothing was as it seemed for Oedipus:

He unknowingly committed patricide
and incest and infested Thebes with the
plague of his own crimes by trying to do
good. His life was a crude juxtaposition of
appearance and reality. But though the
prophecy was finally fulfilled, the ab
solute beauty lies in his anagorisis (recog
nition), which was a consequence of his
pursuit of truth, of knowledge.
Kxamine the circumstances of the
story and you will find the certitude of
commonality. Kach of us has pursued
knowledge in our ways — through
books, papers, politics, conversations, re
ligion, faith. The quest for knowledge is
what drives life and what ultimately
weighs down the hero in a trick of Her
