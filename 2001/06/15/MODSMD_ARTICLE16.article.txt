# COMING TO AMERICA

TQ SHANG

If you've seen "The Falented Mr.
Ripley," there's a cool Italian song
in there, the one that goes "Tu Vu
Fa I . Americano. " Someone told me
it means, "Kveryone sees the American."
So its a song about Americans. Given my
litter lack of knowledge of Italian, the
only words I recognize are, "rock 'n' roll,"
and "whiskv and soda."
Rock 'n' roll is ail-American, sure. A
Kuropean Flvis would've been simply in
conceivable. Imagine a man with huge
sideburns. but now overfed on foie gras
rather than cheeseburgers; in a black
tin tlt*net k rathei than a secjuined white
jumpsuit; and with a cigarette dangling
from the corner of his lips. An aging
slacker, cafe-prowler or lounge lizard,
surely, not an aging rock 11' roll star.
What's more, "Danke, vielen Dank," just
ain't, " I hank you, tli.ink you very much."
But "whisky and soda"? Americans
<11 ink whiskv? Not Corona with lime? I
was stunned.
I thought I knew all about America
•itul Americans, even before I set foot in
this country. Growing up in a cos-

mopolitan city like Sin
gapore, 1 was surround
ed by American c ulture.
It was an unavoidable
fact of life, like the way
your kitchen sink some
times clogs up with Star
bucks coffee grinds. I
grew up just like y'all
from Texas and West

Virginia. I ate pizza and burgers. I
watched American TV. 1 learned that, in
America, white Anglo-Saxon I'rotestauts
had been relegated to places like lowa.
The only people left were Jewish ("Sein
feld") and black ("Fresh I'rince of Bel
Air"). I thought there might be some
Asians because there was some sitcom
about Korean Americans, but Margaret
Clio didn't fit the screen of m\ little
Third World I V.
11 ell. I even grew up singing songs like
"Take Me Home, Countn Road, (lo
the place / I belong / West Virginia
mountain mama . . .) By government de
c tee, all Singaporeans sang this liout .ige
I I onwards, despite having li\e<l our

whole- lives on .1 iro|)i(.il island with no
lIIOIIIII.IIIIS Ol llllls t() Speak of.
"Wh\ do I belong to West \ irginia?' 1
kept wondering. "Where is West Vir
ginia?"
Bui ours not to reason wh\. 1 he other
great song that evei \ Singaporean knows
is "Home ()n I lie Range." (Where the
deer and the antelope pla\ where sel
dom is Ik .ml a discouraging word and
I lie skies arc not cloud\ all dav.) I- vei v el
einentaiA school made its students sing
this from age seven to 12. We didn't know
the song was about Molilalia: we thought
it was about roaming buHalo. Still, .ill this
belonging to West Virginia gave me the
confidence thai I ( on Id blend m seamess
l\ with all-Anient an bovs ant I gii Is.
Iniii\ great surprise, then, it tin net I
out that \nierica lealK isn't like'Bever

in. it it intrigues and petsonal bat k-stab
bing. Instead, ibe\ sat around the tlin
in<> table making Inn ol \oiib Dakota,

then Vermont.
"Who's Vermont?" 1 asked. "What a
funny name. Does he live in FloMo?"
1 hat was a fateful day. Henceforth, I
was determined to become all-Amerit an.
I enlisted the help of my friends fora
complete cultural makeover. I hat was
my four-year goal, my Stanford project,
my intellectual passion. To first under
stand, and then become, this beast —
L'Americano.
I he going was tough, and many were
the clays when 1 nearly gave up. Particu
lar!) discouraging was the time when I
began to lose my British accent and the
t ute girls wouldn't seek me out for long
t hats anymore. Hut I persevered, stut k to
m\ guns and never lost focus.
So it is with great pride that I an
nounce the greatest accolade I've re
ceived at Stanford — indeed, in my
whole life. A friend told me that Judy
(foltlstein, professor of political science
and director of international policy stud
ies, declared in t lass last week that TQ has
become thoroughly Americanized. 1
wasn't taking the class, so naturally I

wasn't there. Was this a random an
nouncement in class." I still don t know,
but it's a great honor nonetheless. I o he
truly, indistinguishably American!
1 now say, "'Sup, dawg," with the best
of them. 1 know when the(.ivil Wai hap
pened. I no longer dance in clubs; I just
freak. 1 say "elevator" instead ot lift,
"pants" instead of "trousers and beey
ach" instead of "bloody twit, 112 spell sul
fur," "favorite" and "defense the Ameri
can way - that is, aicording to the dictates
of Microsoft Word. I own clothing from
Aben rombie and |. drew. I laugh at \ er
mont, and also North Dakota if possible.
On the eve of graduation, mv transfor
mation is almost complete. Now it onl\ I
could acquire a tremendous desire to go
trekking in Nepal.

aiding and abetting in Ins gradual .American
ization. and also for saving Ins ass countless
times. And thanks Mom ami Dad.
