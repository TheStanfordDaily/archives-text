She sits in the third row, watching
the students filter into the auditori
um. It is the beginning of spring
quarter, and the girls are already
weat ing their bright summer dresses. I he
room has an unused feeling to it —every-
thing is white and the design is modern. All
around her students are chatting and
laughing, though tliev grow quiet when he
begins to speak.
Kven from the third row, she is elevated
above him. Fora man of modest height
.ind frame, the professor's voice is strong,
clear. His face is hidden In a thick, dense
beard and wire-rimmed glasses; he is wear
ing his (liarac - teristic 1 -shirt and sandals.
I he lecture is two hours long, some
times without .1 break, but few leave early.
li\ now, she is not surprised that the hours
have passed so quickly. When he finishes
speaking, she's waiting foi the lieadv sen
sation. the signal that her mind is crammed
bin hungering for more.
Knee>uraged to take the course by up
perclassnien, she was hesitant because she
had no background in hard sciences — she
was studying public policy and never liked
biology. "Human behavioral Biologv" was
.in upper-division class, and her friends
who were taking it had already finished a

vear of biology.
After a torturous win
ter quarter, she figured
she needed a break, not a
six-unit science course.
I"he first clav, she slipped
into the ba< k, 10 minutes
late. Sapolskv was talking
about how humans see the
world — the categoi i/.i-

tions people use to rcnicmhci sulm.i\
stops, shapes and colors, lie w.is putting
up images of distortion on t Ik.- board and
students were laughing at t lien < >wn idiot v.
People were laughing, and listening.
She conies hack the next (lass, and the
next. He's talking about the evolution of
kinship and altruism, desc i ibing the sterile
ants who know that, to pass on their genes,
they must help their sistei ants reproduce.
I lien it gets harder; suddenh Sapolskv s
talking about genetic sand she's < lueless.
She signs up for the supplemental (lass
es offered bv the teaching assistants and
learns endocrinology, neuroanatomv; hei
brain is about to explode, lint it helps in
(lass, and though she realizes she might be
struggling compared to her peels, slu
doesn't mind.
Sapolskv shares stories from Ins voutli,

stories of studying baboons in the
Scrcngcti ol Afrit a. I Ic speaks of loneh \ et
exhilarating work, in.in honest u,i\ th.it
makes het wotulet what bet first few wars

She imagines Sapolskv, a foreigner far

is sin c 111.11 even he was doubtful once in a

lines, words. She finds it all yen beautiful
and fast mating, but overwhelming, too.
IVi haps what she tears most in college is
thai the decisions she makes have no pat
to n at all, that they are completely random
and made by chance. Like other college
students, she goes with it at the time, until
looking back through three, then four,
years she realizes she doesn't know what
her next step should be.
I he random steps she has chosen do
not seem to depict a pattern, at least not
vet. She decided bet major one stressful
night sophomore year after looking at all
the courses she had taken—even to ex
-11 at i a pattern of classes related to public
polio was a stretch. She thinks about the
fnends she has made, the girls who have
become her roommates. They have
shaped her life, challenged and inspired
her. And all, she thinks, bv chance.
A veai later, she's about to graduate,
and she's reflecting on her decisions more,
still looking fora pattern. She doesn't see
one, for the people who surround her life
continue to sin pi ise her, in ways that make
her thankful and curious about how they
met, how they became close.
Her public policy courses have deep
ened liei knowledge base in the major, .is

was ihf internum. But it is the classes she
wandered into, the elasses she took on a
whim, that keep her thirsting tor more
knowledge. She once took an introductory
computer programming (lass, and,
though she found it wasn't her strong suit,
the ( lass gave her a different wa\ of think
ing, .1 new language.
Such classes help her decide that it is
what she doesn't know, what's still to he
learned and dissected, that reminds her of
her humanity.
As she prepares for graduation, she re
members the wisdom of a professor who is
probably with wild baboons right now;
Sapolsky spends six months of the veai in
Africa. I he baboons have become part of
the pattern in his life.
I lie pattern of her own life will eventual
ly emerge, she thinks, but tor now each step
isonlva step. She is walking forward without
knowing what to expect, but this time she
trusts herself. She is alread\ imagining how
wonderful it w ill feel to walk on to the stadi
um field, feeling glorious and free.

Wetihsm Ise is a senior graduating in publu
policy. She 71' as an Innovation editor and ropy
editor at The Stanford Daily. She thanks her
family for then unwavering support.

night sophomore year after looking at all
the courses she had taken—even to ex

polio was a stretch. She thinks about the
fnends she has made, the girls who have
become her roommates. They have
shaped her life, challenged and inspired
her. And all, she thinks, bv chance.
A veai later, she's about to graduate,
and she's reflecting on her decisions more,
still looking fora pattern. She doesn't see
one, for the people who surround her life
continue to sin pi ise her, in ways that make
her thankful and curious about how they
met, how they became close.
Her public policy courses have deep

wandered into, the elasses she took on a

computer programming (lass, and,
though she found it wasn't her strong suit,
the ( lass gave her a different wa\ of think

Such classes help her decide that it is
what she doesn't know, what's still to he
learned and dissected, that reminds her of
her humanity.
As she prepares for graduation, she re

Sapolsky spends six months of the veai in
