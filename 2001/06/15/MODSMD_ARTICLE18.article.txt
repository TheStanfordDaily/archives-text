JENNIFER STEWART

A i acronym-prone Stanford, it
was inevitable that mv name be
pei manently c ondensed to Jen-
Stew. Jen Stew rolls more easily
off the tongues of students who speak in
the abbreviated poetic code of Stanford:
MetnClui, I'roFro, FroYoand Hollo.
When 1 was given my nickname, I was
fated with a dilemma. Throughout high
school, I had worked to earn a name for
myself. Now 1 had to create a persona to
till m\ name.
W ho was |enStew?
For one thing, she was much less
anonymous than Jennifer Stewart. I have
a great name, but in the United States
there are more Jennifer Stewarts than
|ane Does.
Wine h is part of the reason that I am in
timidated by the- tact that there is .1 photo
oi me with this column. Throughout my
life, I have been able to hide behind the
anonvmitv of my name. 1 have been able
to pass off mv transgressions as the work of

Jennifer Stewart
JENNIFER STEWART

A i acronym-prone Stanford, it
was inevitable that mv name be
pei manently c ondensed to Jen-
Stew. Jen Stew rolls more easily
off the tongues of students who speak in
the abbreviated poetic code of Stanford:
MetnClui, I'roFro, FroYoand Hollo.
When 1 was given my nickname, I was
fated with a dilemma. Throughout high
school, I had worked to earn a name for
myself. Now 1 had to create a persona to
till m\ name.
W ho was |enStew?
For one thing, she was much less
anonymous than Jennifer Stewart. I have
a great name, but in the United States
there are more Jennifer Stewarts than
|ane Does.
Wine h is part of the reason that I am in
timidated by the- tact that there is .1 photo
oi me with this column. Throughout my
life, I have been able to hide behind the
anonvmitv of my name. 1 have been able
to pass off mv transgressions as the work of

a different Jennifer Stew
art. Didn't like the news
story I he I)aily ran under
the byline jennifei Stew
art? No doubt written In .1
different Jennifer Slew
art. Jennifer Stewart fell
off at .i horse show ? Not
this one.
In fact, if von do an 111-

ternet search for "Jennifei Stewart, the
two top returns are fbi aver\ talented soft
ball player and .1 prolific Internet pot nog
raphy star. I his fad led me to believe foi .1
very long time that somehow there is .1
/ero-sum distribution of talent among .ill
the Jennifei Stewarts 111 the world. Kased
on this theory, 1 want to donate some of
mv studiousness to the sofiball |ennifei 111
exchange fora modicum of athletic t.ilcni.
And, as far as 1 can tell, the othct |ennifer
owes every Jennifer Stewart in the conti
nental United States a cup si/e.

I .ike all ac ion\ ins or abbrc\ iations, my

Koucstrian leain. An abbreviation that

w.is obvious to the 2. r > women on the team
but to no one else.
I he principle was driven home when I
recenth told a group of prospective stu
dents that one of my most powerful expe
riences at Stanford was my time .is MK. I
was gratified by the respect in their faces -
until I realized they thought 1 was a me
( hanical engineer. I meant that I served as
this newspaper s managing editor.
I he abbreviation JcnStew is no differ

mistakes, bad puns and friendships 1 have
made over the last four years — that make
