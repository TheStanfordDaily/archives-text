# BUILDING A COMMUNITY FOR THE FUTURE

ELISABETH PRESSER

We need a Bloomsbury group.
I think it's universally ac
knowledged that the best
part of Stanford is the peo pie
\<>u meet and the friendships you make
here. And 1 suspect that the scariest part
about leaving Stanford for most people is
the fear of losing what has been stub a lov
ing, inspiring and exciting community.
I know I'm terrified of that possibility,
i he problem with graduating is that 1 am in
heaven light now, surrounded as I am by
the most interesting and kind people I have
ever known. I low am I going to go from this
level of interaction to the alienated, insular
expencnceol apartment living and nine-to
five jobs? I low could I possibly want to?
Like Virginia Wolff, ('.live Bell, Roger
Fry and E.M. Forster in early 20th-centu
r\ Kngland, my classmates and I have

spent countless hours in
communion, engaging
ourselves in interdiscipli
nary exploration. Over
the last four years, we
have had three-hour
lunches, all-night talks
and endless Z-writes
about nature, destiny and
angst.

Just as that prolific group of intellectu
als came together one hundred years ago
to challenge traditional notions of reli
gion, art and sexuality, we have encour
aged one another to think and grow and
identify the aspects of society that we feel
we need to change, as well as those that
merit preservation.
What we've done here is, I believe, the
highest and most worthy act of social re

newal. We've supported each other,
looked out for eat li other, and kept each
other ac countable.
While I admit to being frightened of
leaving this place, I believe that it doesn't
have to end here.
I majored in history, and I am apt to
look backward to help me figure out
where 1 can go next. So when I ask what a
group of creative university students in .1
variety of disciplines can do to maintain
their intellectual communih after gradua
tion. I think of the two Stephen brothers
who introduced then sisters to their ( am-
Inidge I niversity friends in 1901. I hey
started a cohort that would make intcllcc -
dial history, promoting Impressionism,
modernist writing and Kevncsian eco
nomic sin a country still hound to Victori
an models of thought.

In addition to Wolff, Forster, Keynes,
I hob\ and Adrian Stephen and the art
critic Bell and artist Fry, there was I Alton
Strachev, a historian, Saxon Svdnev-
I inner, a civil servant, the journalist and
editor Desmond McCarthy and the
painter Duncan Grant. Every Thursday
night, they met for drinks and discussion,
and together came up with revolutionary
literary, economic, artistic and philosoph
ic .il ideas tli.it in turn contributed to some
wildly eclectic interior decoration.
My dream is to continue their tradition.
We don't all have to live in Bloomsbury,
though I can't say I'd be dissatisfied with
that arrangement. We need not meet
every week, though some variation of the
theme would Ix* practical. But 1 propose
that we find a forum that allows us to keep
sharing our ideas as we have done over

brunch and over coffee and in ( lasses here.
We have access to conduits that the
Bloomsburries didn't share, and I plan to
make use of them. An e-mail list is of
course a necessity. Designing a Web site
that we can update with our current cul
tural and philosophical discoveries could
also be a tool. 1 would not be averse to edit
ing a printed journal if some of you would
be willing to contribute.
However you decide to do it.and
whomever you include among vour mem
bers, please do not let this community go.
We have too much to offer one another
and, if I may be so bold, too much to offer
the world.
