# ALL ABOUT OUR PARENTS

It's fitting that graduation lands on
Father's Day this year. There's just
no getting around it: Sunday will
celebrate Mom and Dad.
It will start oil with an early morning
breakfast at the Haas Center. Followed bv
the stadium show and my individually
designed major departmental ceremony.
Then a big family dinner out. My father
should be proud of how much we've
managed to squeeze into 24 hours - it's a
model clay fora family trip.
I'm sure my parents will be sad to say
goodbye to the Farm, though. They've had
tour good years here. It all started in 199H
when they attended the first Parents'
Weekend. My parents (especially mv
mother) pored over the course schedule,
registering tor Social Security with Eco
nomics Prof. John Shoven and the envi
ronment with Biological Sciences Prof.
Steve Schneider. They arrived early to
both classes. Mom took detailed notes. By
their fourth year, they had graduated to
upper-level Parents' Weekend classes, in
cluding Economics Prof. Gavin Wright's
seminar on "Assessing the Economic Suc -
cess of the Cavil Rights Movement."
But Parents' Weekend is not just about

taking classes. It's also
about getting to talk with
University President
John Hennessy,
schmoozing at the par
ents' winetasting and
sampling the dining
halls' finest. In the
course of a few week
ends, my parents got

more exposure to high-level administra
tion at Stanford than I did in all my four
years here.
Never mind the fact that my parents
didn't have time for me. I was just the
shuttle service to and from San Jose Air
port. Occasionally, I'd serve as a "Zagat
Guide," recommending top dining spots
in the area, with the reward of getting to
book reservations for myself as well.
As we approach the end of my — I
mean our — years at Stanford, it seems
only fitting that the University throws an
event where they come first vet again. It's
all about their Stanford experience. So we
have to tour places I've already been (Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, anyone?),
eat lukewarm boxed lunches that I'd like to
avoid and listen to administrators I've al

ready heard.
Of course we have to make all die
events. Baccalaureate, Class Day Lunch
and Commencement are just icing on this
weekend's schedule. Basically, they're
lots of places where we can sit and hear
about other people's experiences at Stan
ford. instead of spending time with the
people who made up our experiences at
Stanford.
And who decided that wearing black
full-length robes during the summer was
a good idea? Don't tell me it was the stu
dents. Just one more photo opportunity
for Mom and Dad.
Instead, students are relegated to plan
our graduation activities in the few hours
left after all the formal events.
The only way I'm going to get to see my
best friend between now and when she
leaves is at a two-family dinner squeezed
in between the SLAC tour and liig Dance
011 Saturday night. I might just drive her
to the airport fora few extra minutes.
My boyfriend and 1 could only go on a
date Tuesday night. After that, my family
has me booked until graduation.
1 can't help but wonder what gradua
tion would be like if students designed it.

My roommate says she would have just
three ingredients: "chips, salsa and beer."
1 could go for that.
Or how about a couple of days at the
beach? Just some time where we can cele
brate each other and what we've done to
gether. Get a good tan. A cookout, per
haps?
Another friend said it'd be nice to have
some "no parents visiting times" on cam
pus. Like visiting hours at a hospital, but
we're all well. We could even extend that
so no parents could come in at all.
Hut I'm not so sure I'd want to go that
far.
Because who'd pack our boxes?
Who'd pay for all the dinners out?
Who'd tell us, with confidence, that
everything after college would be all
right? Who could say that they've gone
through major lile changes before and
survived, and that we will, too?
My adviser will be too busy with his de
partmental functions. My classmates
can't give any experienced perspective. I
have no siblings. So the only people left
are mv parents. The same two individuals
that put Band-Aids on my knees, told me
I looked beautiful with braces, bought nie

my first business suit and gave me career
advice far superior to the Career Devel
opment Center's.
Come to think of it, when I view my
parents this way, they don't seem so bad.
(letting rid of them altogether wouldn't
be right, and besides, I love them. If
Commencement makes them so excited
that they make hotel reservations in July
and load up on hulk film, 1 guess 1
shouldn't try to stop them from having a
good time.
I'll have to have it my way HO years
from now. When my kids are college se
niors, that's when graduation will be all
about me. One day at the beach. Another
winetasting. Maybe I'll even invite some
old college friends up to join me. This
time, we'll be sure to enjoy the show.

It's fitting that graduation lands on
Father's Day this year. There's just
no getting around it: Sunday will
celebrate Mom and Dad.
It will start oil with an early morning
breakfast at the Haas Center. Followed bv
the stadium show and my individually
designed major departmental ceremony.
Then a big family dinner out. My father
should be proud of how much we've
managed to squeeze into 24 hours - it's a
model clay fora family trip.
I'm sure my parents will be sad to say
goodbye to the Farm, though. They've had
tour good years here. It all started in 199H
when they attended the first Parents'
Weekend. My parents (especially mv
mother) pored over the course schedule,
registering tor Social Security with Eco
nomics Prof. John Shoven and the envi
ronment with Biological Sciences Prof.
Steve Schneider. They arrived early to
both classes. Mom took detailed notes. By
their fourth year, they had graduated to
upper-level Parents' Weekend classes, in
cluding Economics Prof. Gavin Wright's
seminar on "Assessing the Economic Suc -
cess of the Cavil Rights Movement."
But Parents' Weekend is not just about

taking classes. It's also
about getting to talk with
University President
John Hennessy,
schmoozing at the par
ents' winetasting and
sampling the dining
halls' finest. In the
course of a few week
ends, my parents got

more exposure to high-level administra
tion at Stanford than I did in all my four
years here.
Never mind the fact that my parents
didn't have time for me. I was just the
shuttle service to and from San Jose Air
port. Occasionally, I'd serve as a "Zagat
Guide," recommending top dining spots
in the area, with the reward of getting to
book reservations for myself as well.
As we approach the end of my — I
mean our — years at Stanford, it seems
only fitting that the University throws an
event where they come first vet again. It's
all about their Stanford experience. So we
have to tour places I've already been (Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, anyone?),
eat lukewarm boxed lunches that I'd like to
avoid and listen to administrators I've al

ready heard.
Of course we have to make all die
events. Baccalaureate, Class Day Lunch
and Commencement are just icing on this
weekend's schedule. Basically, they're
lots of places where we can sit and hear
