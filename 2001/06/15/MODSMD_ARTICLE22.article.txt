## Young Card seeks title 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
OMAHA, Neb. — Somebody
pinch these guys. On second
thought, it may he better to wait
until tomorrow evening to wake
the Cardinal baseball team.
Stanford's dreamlike postsea
son run continued Wednesday
evening in ()maha as the Cardinal
defeated Cal State-Fullerton, 4-1,
to advance to tomorrow's College
World Series championship game
against Miami.
In its best all-around perfor
mance of the CWS, Stanford (51-
lti) stifled the Titans (48-IS) be
hind sophomore Jeremy Outline's
outstanding outing on (lie hill.
Outline, who allowed five runs in
1 1/3 innings in the Cardinal's
opening CWS game against lu
lane June S, returned to form and
stymied Fullerton batters with
seven-plus innings of dominant
four-hit work.
The grounds crew at Rosen
blatt Stadium must have had to
level out the dirt in front of home
plate after Wednesday night, ,is
the Titans pounded ball after kill
into the ground to help Outline
collect 13 easy groundouts.
"We looked at film after Friday
and we found some things that
definitely needed fixing," Outline
said. "1 knew I would get another
chance when our team won [on
Friday], so that w.isa reall\ positive
feeling for me.'
Displaying the dynamite slider
and ptecise control that made liini
the S7th pick of the Major League
Baseball draft earlier this month,
Outline needed only (">5 pitches to
get through his first six innings.

(Clockwise from top) 1) Junior pitcher Jeff Bruksch leads the team as they celebrate their 4 1 win over
Cal State-Fullerton on Wednesday. 2) Freshman designated hitter Jonny Ash looks to avoid an out. 3)
Sophomore catcher Ryan Garko readies to make a play at the plate 4) Top-seeded Fullerton's second
loss to Stanford eliminated the team from the College World Series.
While excellent pitching and
consistent defense held the I ii.m
oHense in diet k, Stanford slowly
went to work .it the plate. Fresh
man Brian I hill, making his first
si.in of the tournament, took ad
vantage <>1 winds approaching HO
mph and jacked Ins first home
inn since January in the third in
ning off Fnllerton starter Jon
Slllilll. giving the Cardinal an
e.n l\ 1-0 lead.
()ne inning later, a hit batsman
and two singles up the middle
loaded the bases for junior Andy
lopham. lie promptly grounded
.i Smith offering past second base
to drive in a pail of runs on his first
hit in 1 I (:ws at-hats.
I lie (Cardinal's most punishing
blow, however, came on sopho
more Rvan (iarko's lowering tape
measure home run to center field.
I lie ball traveled almost 450 feet
off his bat over the camera tent
atop the batter's eye, marking
(iarko's second 400-foot blast in as
many games and putting Stanford
on top, 4-0.
An instant after he made con
tact, (iarko flipped his bat away as
if disgusted by his own power — a
( elebration that is slowly becoming
the catcher's trademark — and
was mobbed by teammates at
home plate.
"I think it's just more of a reac
tion than anything planned, and I
kind of just put the bat down
quick," (iarko said.
(iarko's improved defense also
gave Stanford a welcome lift dur
ing Wednesday night's contest. In
the fnllerton seventh, with men

on second and third and one out,
first baseman Arik VanZanclt field
ed a ground hall and fired home to
.1 perfectly positioned (iarko, who
tagged the streaking Robert Cu/-
ni.in to c ui clown a run. (iuthric al
lowed the next batter, Mike Rouse,
to double and bring in the 1 itans'
onlv run, but followed with his fifth
strikeout lo end the threat.
Fnllerton gave the Cardinal
faithful, who have become accus
tomed to late-inning butterflies
during the 2001 postseason, yet
another scare when Shane Costa
led off the eighth with a single to
chase Cuthrie. After junior |ef 1
Bruksch entered and induced a
flyout to right, (iarko rifled a per
fect throw to second baseman
Chris O'Riftrdan to snub Costa's
steal attempt during 111 uksc li s 12-
pitcli battle with fitan leader
David liacani.
Bruksch picked up his third
save <>l the 2001 (IWS .iikl f<>ui ill
in Omaha all-lime, both CWS
records, with two innings of gutsy
relief. While Hi uksc li spent the en
tire 2001 season as a starter, head
coach Mark Marquess has used
him during the (IWS exclusively as
a closer — a role Bruksch perfect
ed last season when he earned a
school-record 1 ;i saves.
"I've been asking (Bruksch] to
do things lie hasn't clone all \e.u .
and mentally he is able to do that
because of last season," Marquess
said.
Marquess hands junioi Mike
(iosling the ball to start the (Cardi
nal's fourth NCAA championship
game in school liiston and its sec -
ond in two years. I he southpaw
dismantled Fnllerton loi 7 2:1 in
nings in Sunday's winnei sin a< kei
game, allowing one inn and two
hits while fanuinu c iuhi I itans.

II lie c in bring a similar effort to
Rosenblatt Stadium tomorrow,
Stanford < ould end up celebrating
its third ( AVS title in school histo
ry. with perhaps Marquess's most
unlikely squad bringing it hack to
the l atin.
I Ins is a special group because

not much was expected of them,"
said Marquess, who has empha
sized .ill week th.it he hoped to fin
ish at the.">(>( 1 mark beldre the sea
son began. "It is truly amazing."
I ophain, speaking for the play
ers, added:"(loach keeps telling us
that he didn't expect us to be here,

but we definitely expected to be
here."
Miami enters the championship
game having won lf> games in a
row with its pitc liing stall in order.
I he Hurricanes displayed I licit
\ersatilit\ In winning slugfests and
pitching duels in ()niaha this week

.iikl feature outstanding athletes at
most even position.
Nevertheless, lor the second
consecutive season, Stanford sits
on the c usp of hoisting the NCAA
tropin. One more victory and
even pinching the Cardinal won't
be able to wake it 112 rom its dream.
