# Freshmen play beyond years

### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
OMAHA, Neb.—They carry all the
equipment and are the bntts of everv
joke.
At this stage of the season for the
Stanford baseball freshman class, those
are about the only ways the four first
year starters can be distinguished from
the rest of their scjuad.
Ibis Saturday, Jonny Ash, Brian
11.ill, Sam I-1 ilc 1 and (.arlos Quentin will
make their way into the 2001 Co liege
World Series championship game 110
longer the timid, inexperienced group
of guys they were when they first arrived
at Stanford.
"I don't think they're really freshmen
anymore," head coach Mark Marquess
said. "It's really been remarkable what
they've done this season."
Marquess said that he was nervous
going into the postseason with guvs who
had not felt the pressure of playing 111
such vital collegiate games, especially
with the prospect of starting an outfield
that consisted of three freshmen in I fall,
Fuld and Quentin.
It turns out that Marquess had no
need to be apprehensive.
Fuld has been the ('.ardinal's go-to
guy ever since the team arrived in
()maha. After going 3-tbr-3 with a don

ble .iikl two RBI in a I 1 I opening \ u -
lory over I ulane, Fuld hit .1 two-RBI
triple in extra innings against C.al State-
Fnllerton, which broke the game open
and led to another Stanford win. 1 le h;is
also scored .1 leam-lcading 10 runs in
postseason plav.
After c apturing Pacific 10 C '.onfercnce
Freslinian Player of the ear honors.
Quenlin has continued to pro\ ide signif
icant contributions as the clean-up hitter
throughout the plavofls.
Quentin's batting average in the post
season heading into the ( \\ S (,H53) was
.1 point higher than his regular-season
average, lie provided the gaine-win
ning RBI single in .1 KM) elimination
game win in the regional at Sunken 1 >1.1-
mond, and he went 4-fbr-5, scoring
three runs 111 the super-regional opener
against South (larolina.
"I really didn't expect anv freshman
lo have the impad that 1 .arlos and Fuld
have made, but 1 11 take it," Marquess
said.
Furthermore, Ash, the Cardinal's
designated hitter, has a .441 average
throughout the playoff's with nine RBI.
According to junior second baseman
('.ln is O'Riordan, one wouldn't expect
Ash to be such a threat at the plate.
"Jonny always seems like he's out of it.
but, once lie's on the baseball field, lie's
one of the most focused iruvs now see."

(VRiordan said.
And not to be forgotten, Hall broke
into the starting lineup once again
Wednesday night after having a stand
out performance in left field earlier in
the week as a defensive replacement for
sophomore Jason (looper. I hill's catch at
the wall Sunday night prevented the l i
tans from winning the game with a walk
oil home run and allowed the Cardinal
to emerge victorious in the 10th inning.
I hen, in Ins first at-bat as a starter
Wednesday, Hall ripped Ins second
home run of the year to give Stanford a
1 -0 lead. I le also battled back from an 0-
2 count in Ins lii st CWS at-bat against
I ulane to draw a walk that extended the
inning and enabled Stanford to come
back from an early 8-0 deficit.
At this point of the season, some of the
older players say that they have become
used to watching all four freshmen play
such pivotal roles.
"It doesn't surprise me that they're
doing so well bet ause they've been doing
it all year long," junior Andy Topham
said.
Even more impressive is the fact that,
in Nebraska, the four are doing it in the
midst of a demanding schedule that in
cludes the time-consuming task of talk
ing to television, radio and newspaper
reporters in between practices — not to
mention the fact that they had to take fi
nals. too.
"lobe honest, I thought we'd have a
little more time to relax," Quentin said.
But despite the lack of time, the new
guys have still relished being on the field
at Rosenblatt Stadium.
"This is honestly a dream come true,"
said Ash, who recalled being in Okla
homa at this time last year with a sum
mer-league team. "I remember watch
ing the CWS on I V, swinging a bat in mv
host family 's living room, just thinking,'l
want to be there next year.' "
Not only has Ash accomplished that
goal, but he also has a chance to help
Stanford win its first championship since
1088, a feat the Cardinal barely missed
achieving last year when it lost to
Louisiana State in the title game, 6-5.
While that heartbreaking loss might
have brought most teams down, Hall
said he believes it did not have as much
of an effect on this year's club.
"I think our youth has helped to not
allow us to remember last year because
the majority of the guys were not around
playing," he said.
Therefore, as the saying goes, igno
rance is bliss, and innocence must be as
well, in the case of the first playoff expe
riences for each freshman starter.
"Throughout the whole postseason,
these guys don't really know what
they're doing; they're just playing like its
another game," Topham said.
Come Saturday, then, it will be just
another game for these four individuals.
With the national title on the line.

home run of the year to give Stanford a
1 -0 lead. I le also battled back from an 0-

inning and enabled Stanford to come

At this point of the season, some of the
older players say that they have become
used to watching all four freshmen play
such pivotal roles.
"It doesn't surprise me that they're
doing so well bet ause they've been doing
it all year long," junior Andy Topham
said.
Even more impressive is the fact that,
in Nebraska, the four are doing it in the
midst of a demanding schedule that in
cludes the time-consuming task of talk
ing to television, radio and newspaper
reporters in between practices — not to
mention the fact that they had to take fi
nals. too.
"lobe honest, I thought we'd have a
little more time to relax," Quentin said.
But despite the lack of time, the new
guys have still relished being on the field
at Rosenblatt Stadium.
"This is honestly a dream come true,"
said Ash, who recalled being in Okla
homa at this time last year with a sum
mer-league team. "I remember watch
ing the CWS on I V, swinging a bat in mv
host family 's living room, just thinking,'l
want to be there next year.' "
Not only has Ash accomplished that
goal, but he also has a chance to help
Stanford win its first championship since
1088, a feat the Cardinal barely missed
achieving last year when it lost to
Louisiana State in the title game, 6-5.
While that heartbreaking loss might
have brought most teams down, Hall
said he believes it did not have as much
of an effect on this year's club.
"I think our youth has helped to not
allow us to remember last year because
the majority of the guys were not around
playing," he said.
Therefore, as the saying goes, igno
rance is bliss, and innocence must be as
well, in the case of the first playoff expe
riences for each freshman starter.
"Throughout the whole postseason,
these guys don't really know what
they're doing; they're just playing like its
another game," Topham said.
Come Saturday, then, it will be just
another game for these four individuals.
With the national title on the line.

Player of the Year honors and contributed as the clean-up hitter all season.
OMAHA, Neb.—They carry all the
equipment and are the bntts of everv
joke.
At this stage of the season for the
Stanford baseball freshman class, those
are about the only ways the four first
year starters can be distinguished from
the rest of their scjuad.
Ibis Saturday, Jonny Ash, Brian
11.ill, Sam I-1 ilc 1 and (.arlos Quentin will
make their way into the 2001 Co liege
World Series championship game 110
longer the timid, inexperienced group
of guys they were when they first arrived
at Stanford.
"I don't think they're really freshmen
anymore," head coach Mark Marquess
said. "It's really been remarkable what
they've done this season."
Marquess said that he was nervous
going into the postseason with guvs who
had not felt the pressure of playing 111
such vital collegiate games, especially
with the prospect of starting an outfield
that consisted of three freshmen in I fall,
Fuld and Quentin.
It turns out that Marquess had no
need to be apprehensive.
Fuld has been the ('.ardinal's go-to
guy ever since the team arrived in
()maha. After going 3-tbr-3 with a don

ble .iikl two RBI in a I 1 I opening \ u -
lory over I ulane, Fuld hit .1 two-RBI
triple in extra innings against C.al State-
Fnllerton, which broke the game open
and led to another Stanford win. 1 le h;is
also scored .1 leam-lcading 10 runs in
postseason plav.
