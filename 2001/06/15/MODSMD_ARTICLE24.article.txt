### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
OMAHA, Neb.—The 2001 season was
just beginning, and junior pitcher Mike
(iosling had alreadv had enough.
After a full 2000 spring season at Stan
ford, a summer on the I .S. national team,
fall ball and then extra training last winter,
(iosling was tired, and Ins throwing elbow
was sore.
"1 felt like I was already at the end ola
year," Costing said. "I just needed some
time off ."
The left-handed (iosling wanted to stai t
opening day so badly, though, that he still
tried to battle through the soreness.
That wasn't the best idea.
One inning and four runs into Gosling's
first start, head coach Mark Marquess
pulled him from the game.
"I thought I could fight through it,"
(iosling said. "I went out there and it just
didn't feelgood. I realized 1 wasn't helping
my team by being out there."
So Gosling irecl his tendonitis-stricken
elbow and waited. I or a month, he gave Ins
arm the rest it needed, and it worked. He
came back and went 7-0 in his 1 1 starts
during the regular season, including a
complete-game shutout of California in
which he had 10 strikeouts.
And now, almost five months after that
ominous first game, (iosling will have the
spotlight on him once again. 1 his Saturday,
he will take the mound as the Cardinal's
starting pitcher in an attempt to lead the
(lardinal to its first national title in 1 3 vears.
"It's an honor to start the c hainpionship
game," said Gosling, a second-round pick
by the Arizona Diamondbacks. "That is
real special, and I'd feel great going out
there."
After his regular-season success,
(iosling (7-2) still has something to
prove. In his three postseason starts, he
has lost twice and has yet to tally a win.
After throwing four scoreless innings
against Texas in the regional at Sunken
Diamond, Gosling gave up four runs in
the fifth en route to a 4-3 loss. I lien, iu
the NCAA Super Regional, (iosling had a
no-hitter going into the fifth, before lie
allowed three runs and took the loss to
South Carolina.
Gosling turned it around a hit l.ist Sun
day. Focusing on "avoiding the big in
ning," he gave up only one run on two hits
in 7 2/3 innings of work, fhe only reason
(ioslingearned a no-decision and not a vic -
tory was that Cal State-Fullerton's Kirk
Saarloos, a third-round draft pick by the
Houston Astros, pitched just as well, going
8 1/3 innings and allowing one run.
"Mike proved himself big-time against
Saarloos, and I think he's been our top guy
as of late, even though he hasn't gotten a
win in the postseason," fellow pitcher ju
nior Mike Wodnicki said. "1 can't think of
a better guy to start the championship
game for us."

I hat sentiment is a long leap from what
people might have said about (iosling two
vears ago. As .if reshman-, l ie earned a spot
iu the rotation .is the Sunday starter, only
to lose it as a result of problems.
I he Salt 1 ake (lit\ native noted that he
then showed flashes on the mound as a
sophomore, but that he couldn't establish
the consistenc \ to help him break into the
dominant starting rotation that included
Justin Wavne, |ason Young and Brian
Sager.
"It was a learning experience," (iosling
said. "I just wasn't reach for the responsi
bility. It lias all been a gradual process."
But when all of last year's starters left
Stanford, (iosling saw his c hance to make
an impact on this year's squad. Rather
than taking time oil in the winter to recov
er from what had already been a long year,
he decided to throw more in order to build
arm strength.
According to (iosling, that was a big
mistake.
"Instead of strengthening my arm,
throwing more just made m\ arm tired. It
was real frustrating," he said.
But time took care of (iosling's elbow
soreness and has allowed liiin to get back
on toj) ol Ins game. Ihe onlv thing he
might be unhappy with now is the fact that
he was c hoscn in the second round of the
Major League Draft after having been a
projected first-round pit k.
"While the draft was going, I was a little
disappointed not hearing in\ name being
called," (iosling said, "but when the Dia
mondbacks pit ked me, 1 was happy. It
looks like they want to get a fair deal done,
and I want to get a fait deal clone, so it will
work out well."
And il (iosling is still angry about being
overlooked, he certainly doesn't show it.
w hit h is common foi the lefty whether he
is on or oil the mound.
He's more of an inner competitor,"
Wodnicki said. "He's not really going to
show any flash on the mound, come right
in yelling or anything, which is just his
mentality. It works for him; we all know
that lie's tiled up inside. We all know he's
got that spark."
So before (iosling hits the golf course
this siimmet to take some precious time
off. he'll have to show that spark one last
time in what will most likely he his final col
legiate game.
And what better way to end his colle
giate c areer than to help his team win a na
tional title (hat Stanford was so close to
earning last season, before Louisiana State
shocked the Cardinal with a late-inning
comeback win in the c hainpionship game.
"I haven't thought about that at all,"
(iosling said. "It's a new year, a new team,
and a new tournament; LSIJ isn't even
here."
But Gosling is here, and the 2001 col
lege baseball c hampionship is up for grabs.
It's now his — and Stanford's — for the
taking.

The left-handed (iosling wanted to stai t
opening day so badly, though, that he still
tried to battle through the soreness.
That wasn't the best idea.
One inning and four runs into Gosling's
first start, head coach Mark Marquess
pulled him from the game.
"I thought I could fight through it,"
(iosling said. "I went out there and it just
didn't feelgood. I realized 1 wasn't helping
my team by being out there."
So Gosling irecl his tendonitis-stricken
elbow and waited. I or a month, he gave Ins
arm the rest it needed, and it worked. He
came back and went 7-0 in his 1 1 starts
during the regular season, including a
complete-game shutout of California in
which he had 10 strikeouts.
And now, almost five months after that
ominous first game, (iosling will have the
spotlight on him once again. 1 his Saturday,
he will take the mound as the Cardinal's
starting pitcher in an attempt to lead the
(lardinal to its first national title in 1 3 vears.
"It's an honor to start the c hainpionship
game," said Gosling, a second-round pick
by the Arizona Diamondbacks. "That is
real special, and I'd feel great going out
there."
After his regular-season success,
(iosling (7-2) still has something to
prove. In his three postseason starts, he
has lost twice and has yet to tally a win.
After throwing four scoreless innings
against Texas in the regional at Sunken
Diamond, Gosling gave up four runs in
the fifth en route to a 4-3 loss. I lien, iu
the NCAA Super Regional, (iosling had a
no-hitter going into the fifth, before lie
allowed three runs and took the loss to
South Carolina.
Gosling turned it around a hit l.ist Sun
day. Focusing on "avoiding the big in
ning," he gave up only one run on two hits
in 7 2/3 innings of work, fhe only reason
(ioslingearned a no-decision and not a vic -
tory was that Cal State-Fullerton's Kirk
Saarloos, a third-round draft pick by the
Houston Astros, pitched just as well, going
8 1/3 innings and allowing one run.
"Mike proved himself big-time against
Saarloos, and I think he's been our top guy
as of late, even though he hasn't gotten a
win in the postseason," fellow pitcher ju
nior Mike Wodnicki said. "1 can't think of
a better guy to start the championship
game for us."

"It was a learning experience," (iosling
said. "I just wasn't reach for the responsi

But when all of last year's starters left
Stanford, (iosling saw his c hance to make

"I haven't thought about that at all,"
(iosling said. "It's a new year, a new team,

It's now his — and Stanford's — for the
taking.
OMAHA, Neb.—The 2001 season was
just beginning, and junior pitcher Mike
(iosling had alreadv had enough.
After a full 2000 spring season at Stan
ford, a summer on the I .S. national team,
fall ball and then extra training last winter,
(iosling was tired, and Ins throwing elbow
was sore.
"1 felt like I was already at the end ola
year," Costing said. "I just needed some
time off ."

opening day so badly, though, that he still
tried to battle through the soreness.
