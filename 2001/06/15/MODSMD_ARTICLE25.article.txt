1 lit* No. I Stanford women's
tennis team has a long tradition of
excellence, but what it did this
season may never be repeated.
On May 21, the Cardinal (30-0),
led by the unprecedented success
of Granville, finished an unde
feated season with a national
championship, Stanford's first of
the year.
I he Cardinal earned its 11th
NCAA women's tennis title In
shutting out the up-and-coming
Vanderbilt Commodores (26-5),
4-0, at the Lincoln Tennis Center
in Stone Mountain, Ca. In the
tournament, Stanford shut out
Boston College, Mississippi, Wake
Forest, Arizona State and Vander
bilt, dropping only one point to
Florida in the semifinals. Stan
ford's opponents stored only out
point in the tournament, the low
est total since it was expanded to a
field of 04.
With Granville at No. 1,
Kalvaria at No. 9, junior Gabriela
Lastra at No. 17 and junior Keiko
lokuda at No. 50, no rival team
could slant! up to Stanford matt h
for-match.

After helping their team win

bases-loa/led tivo-Rlil single in the
eighth inning as the ( '.animal sqweze
fiast Texas, 4-3, in the NCAA Region
al\s on its wax to the ('.allege World Se
ries.
Nobody could have predicted
this. After a season in which the
Stanford baseball team had only
one returning starter, t In- (Cardinal
came <>ut .is strt>ng as e\ er this year,
eventually earning a No. 1 ranking
midwav through the season.
However, despite its early-sea
son success, on Sunday, May 27.
very few people would have pre
dicted that the Cardinal could
make it out of the NCAA Region
al. On that day, Stanford needed
to defeat the Texas Longhoi ns
twice to advance to the supei-re
gional the following week. A day
earlier, the (lardinal lost to Texas,
1-H, to create the uncomfortable
situation.
In the first game, Stanford
blew a 9-5 lead, and the game
was forced into extra innings. In
the bottom of the lOth. fresh
in. m Carlos Quentin proved to
be the game's hero, hitting a
bases-loaded RBI-single to light
field that stored junior Chris
(VRiordan to give the (lardinal a
10-9 win.
The Stanford heroics contin
ued in the second game when
Carko looped a bases-loaded two-
RBI single |iist out of the reach of
Longhorn second baseman I itn
Moss in the top of the eighth in
ning. scoring juniors Scott Drag
it evit hand Auk Y'anZandt to give

the (lardinal the 4-3 win. Stanford
had trailed 3-1 heading into the in
ning. but stored a run on .i satii
fice fl\ In (VRiordan to in.ike the
store .'i-'J before (iai kocamc to the
plate.
A week later, the Cardinal
needed three games to get bv the
South (larolina (»,unettwks to ad

vance to the ( lollege World Series.
()n June I, Stanford won the first
game easily, 10-9. South Carolina
bounced back the next day in a 4-H
victory to force a third and decid
ing game. I he (lardinal preserved
a .3-2 lead throughout the game to
take the victory and the College
World Series berth.

With less than four strands on the dock, sophomore
(Insey facobsen hits a dutch lay-aft as the men's basketball
team escapes the I'ete Next'ell Challenge with an S-t-SJ win
over No. I Duke.
At the beginning of the men's basketball season,
Duke and Arizona, with their incredible talent and
athleticism, were seen in a ( lass by themselves. Mite
teams like defending champion Michigan State,
perennial powerhouses North Carolina and Kansas,
and even Stanford, were relegated to second-tiet sta
tus.
Over winter break, the Cardinal proved everyone
wrong. On Dec. 21, in front of the largest < rowd evei

to watch a college basketball game in the state of Cal
ifornia, the then-No. .S ( ardinal overcame a 15-point
deficit in the second half to pull within one point of
the then-No. I Blue Devils with four seconds left.
That's when All-American Jacobsen put the game in
his own hands and hit a lay-up to give Duke its first
loss of the season.
A week later, the < iardinal traveled to the McKale
Center, where it hadn't seen a win in over four years,
to t.ike on the Arizona Wildcats. Stanford dismantled
the Wildcats on their home court with an H. r >-7(> victo
ry, which propelled the Cardinal to a No. I national
ranking.
Stanford finished its season by advancing to the
I lite l .ight of the NCAA I out nainent before falling to
\lai \ land. H7-7.'t.

while sophomore Dana Sorensen

Stanford proved itself at the
Women's ( .ollege World Series .is
well. I he (Cardinal, the sixth seed,
began the series In upsetting
third-seeded lxiuisiana State, 2-1,
in extra innings. Stantord lost its
next game, ">-0, to No. 2 seed

While the Stanford football team
didn't earn its second consecutive
Rose Bowl berth, ibis year's team
had nothing to be ashamed of. In an
up-and-down season, the Cardinal
finished a respectable fourth plate
iu tlir Pacific 10 Conference.
1 lie season began on a high note
on Sept. lb, when the Cardinal host
ed the No. 5 Texas Longhorns, a
team that demolished Stanford a
year earlier in Austin, Texas.
But the Cardinal, supported bv
miracle-maker I iger Woods, taught
the Longhorns a lesson: Don't inc-ss
with Stanford. With starting quar
terback l asani bit with an injury
during the game, backup ('.hi is
Lewis found Deßonnie Pitts, who
flipped over the end/one with less
than two minutes remaining to give
the Cardinal the shocking 27-24
win.
Stanford ended its season m ex
(iting fashion .is well. In the KKtrd
Big Came, the Cardinal made sure
tli.it another ( lass of seniors would
graduate from Stanford without los
ing to the Weenies. While the Bears
pushed the ('.arditial to overtime in
a sold-out Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley, Stanford head coach Iv
rone Willingham called a trick plav,
Tasani's pass i<> Moore, fooling all
the Bear players and securing the
Stanford victorv.

Dominant si rimming trams finish

Kxcellence is the norm for the
Stanford men's and women's swim
ming teams. I his year's teams were
no different.
Undefeated and brimming with
confidence, the No. 2 Cardinal
headed to College Station, Texas.
Ik>in March 22 to March 24, in
tending to unseat defending cham
pions Texas at the NCAA Men's
Swimming (Championships.
While the the Tonghorns pre
vailed, storing 597.5 points to Stan
ford's 457.5, the Cardinal had manv
highlights at the NCAA Champi
onships and throughout the season.

Ijed by a strong core of seniors —
Adam Messner, Steven Itrown and
Anthonv Robinson — and a pletho
ra of talented freshmen, the (Cardi
nal .k hieved it's 20th straight Pacific
I0( Conference title.
I he women finished the seasc m as
strong as tlieii m;de counterparts. In
the closest meet in NCAA histoid,
Stanford placed seconcl to the (Geor
gia bulldogs ai the 2001 NCAA
Championships ,11 the Nassau
Aquatic ( enter in long Island, N.Y.
Winning six of 21 events, the (Cardi
nal finished with 387.5 points, just
1.5 points behind (Ce< >rgia's MB9.
Despite the second-place finish,
the (Cardinal ret eived individual li

Junior Jesse ilutvuis becomes the
first ('.ordinal to capture the 3,000-
meter steeplechase at the Pacific 10 Con
ference (Jmmpionships, helping the
men's bock team win its first Pac-I0 title
since 1927.
Although it didn't repeat as
national champions, this year's
men's track team did something
even more difficult when it cap
tured the Pacific 10 Conference
title.
Because the Pac-10's scoring is
weighted against distance running,
Stanford's strength, the Cardinal
has always placed better at the
NCAAs than Pac-10s.
This year was the exception.
The Stanford men's middle dis
tance and distance runners stored
a staggering HI points out of the
team's 142 total, whit h topped de
fending champion Southern Cali
fornia's score of 136.
In addition to Thomas's 3000-
meter steeplechase title, junior
Cabe Jennings (3:43.30), fresh
man Don Sage (3:43.70), fresh
man Grant Robison (3:44.13) and
senior |onathon Riley (3:44.47)
finished a remarkable first
through-fourth sweep of the
1,500 meters. The Cardinal also
received individual Pac-10 titles
from sophomore Michael
Ponikvar in the high jump and se
nior Michael Stember in the 800
meters.
The Cardinal ended its season
with a fourth-place finish at the
NCAA Championships in Eugene,

Coming into the final week of
the women's basketball Pacific 10
Conference season, nobotlv be
lieved tli.it the ('.ardinal could have

Nobody could have predicted
this. After a season in which the
Stanford baseball team had only
one returning starter, t In- (Cardinal
came <>ut .is strt>ng as e\ er this year,
eventually earning a No. 1 ranking
midwav through the season.
However, despite its early-sea
son success, on Sunday, May 27.
very few people would have pre
dicted that the Cardinal could
make it out of the NCAA Region
al. On that day, Stanford needed
to defeat the Texas Longhoi ns
twice to advance to the supei-re
gional the following week. A day
earlier, the (lardinal lost to Texas,
1-H, to create the uncomfortable
situation.
In the first game, Stanford
blew a 9-5 lead, and the game
was forced into extra innings. In
the bottom of the lOth. fresh
in. m Carlos Quentin proved to
be the game's hero, hitting a
bases-loaded RBI-single to light
field that stored junior Chris
(VRiordan to give the (lardinal a
10-9 win.
The Stanford heroics contin
ued in the second game when

A week later, the Cardinal
needed three games to get bv the
South (larolina (»,unettwks to ad

vance to the ( lollege World Series.
()n June I, Stanford won the first
game easily, 10-9. South Carolina
bounced back the next day in a 4-H
victory to force a third and decid
ing game. I he (lardinal preserved
a .3-2 lead throughout the game to
take the victory and the College
World Series berth.

With less than four strands on the dock, sophomore
(Insey facobsen hits a dutch lay-aft as the men's basketball
team escapes the I'ete Next'ell Challenge with an S-t-SJ win
over No. I Duke.
At the beginning of the men's basketball season,
Duke and Arizona, with their incredible talent and
athleticism, were seen in a ( lass by themselves. Mite
teams like defending champion Michigan State,
perennial powerhouses North Carolina and Kansas,
and even Stanford, were relegated to second-tiet sta
tus.
Over winter break, the Cardinal proved everyone
wrong. On Dec. 21, in front of the largest < rowd evei

to watch a college basketball game in the state of Cal
ifornia, the then-No. .S ( ardinal overcame a 15-point
deficit in the second half to pull within one point of
the then-No. I Blue Devils with four seconds left.
That's when All-American Jacobsen put the game in
his own hands and hit a lay-up to give Duke its first
loss of the season.
A week later, the < iardinal traveled to the McKale
Center, where it hadn't seen a win in over four years,
to t.ike on the Arizona Wildcats. Stanford dismantled
the Wildcats on their home court with an H. r >-7(> victo
ry, which propelled the Cardinal to a No. I national
ranking.
Stanford finished its season by advancing to the

While the Stanford football team
didn't earn its second consecutive
Rose Bowl berth, ibis year's team
had nothing to be ashamed of. In an
up-and-down season, the Cardinal
finished a respectable fourth plate
iu tlir Pacific 10 Conference.
1 lie season began on a high note
on Sept. lb, when the Cardinal host
ed the No. 5 Texas Longhorns, a
team that demolished Stanford a
year earlier in Austin, Texas.
But the Cardinal, supported bv
miracle-maker I iger Woods, taught
the Longhorns a lesson: Don't inc-ss
with Stanford. With starting quar
terback l asani bit with an injury
during the game, backup ('.hi is
Lewis found Deßonnie Pitts, who
flipped over the end/one with less
than two minutes remaining to give
the Cardinal the shocking 27-24
win.
Stanford ended its season m ex
(iting fashion .is well. In the KKtrd
Big Came, the Cardinal made sure
tli.it another ( lass of seniors would
graduate from Stanford without los
ing to the Weenies. While the Bears
pushed the ('.arditial to overtime in
a sold-out Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley, Stanford head coach Iv
rone Willingham called a trick plav,
Tasani's pass i<> Moore, fooling all
the Bear players and securing the
Stanford victorv.

Kxcellence is the norm for the
Stanford men's and women's swim

no different.
Undefeated and brimming with
confidence, the No. 2 Cardinal
headed to College Station, Texas.
Ik>in March 22 to March 24, in
tending to unseat defending cham
pions Texas at the NCAA Men's
Swimming (Championships.
While the the Tonghorns pre
vailed, storing 597.5 points to Stan
ford's 457.5, the Cardinal had manv
highlights at the NCAA Champi
onships and throughout the season.

Ijed by a strong core of seniors —
Adam Messner, Steven Itrown and
Anthonv Robinson — and a pletho
ra of talented freshmen, the (Cardi
nal .k hieved it's 20th straight Pacific
I0( Conference title.
I he women finished the seasc m as
strong as tlieii m;de counterparts. In
the closest meet in NCAA histoid,
Stanford placed seconcl to the (Geor
gia bulldogs ai the 2001 NCAA
Championships ,11 the Nassau
Aquatic ( enter in long Island, N.Y.
Winning six of 21 events, the (Cardi
nal finished with 387.5 points, just
1.5 points behind (Ce< >rgia's MB9.
Despite the second-place finish,
the (Cardinal ret eived individual li

Junior Jesse ilutvuis becomes the
first ('.ordinal to capture the 3,000-
meter steeplechase at the Pacific 10 Con
ference (Jmmpionships, helping the
men's bock team win its first Pac-I0 title
since 1927.
Although it didn't repeat as
national champions, this year's
men's track team did something
even more difficult when it cap
tured the Pacific 10 Conference
title.
Because the Pac-10's scoring is
weighted against distance running,
Stanford's strength, the Cardinal
has always placed better at the
NCAAs than Pac-10s.
This year was the exception.
The Stanford men's middle dis
tance and distance runners stored
a staggering HI points out of the
team's 142 total, whit h topped de
fending champion Southern Cali

In addition to Thomas's 3000-

Cabe Jennings (3:43.30), fresh

While the Stanford football team
didn't earn its second consecutive
Rose Bowl berth, ibis year's team
had nothing to be ashamed of. In an
up-and-down season, the Cardinal
finished a respectable fourth plate
iu tlir Pacific 10 Conference.
1 lie season began on a high note
on Sept. lb, when the Cardinal host
ed the No. 5 Texas Longhorns, a
team that demolished Stanford a
year earlier in Austin, Texas.
But the Cardinal, supported bv
miracle-maker I iger Woods, taught
the Longhorns a lesson: Don't inc-ss
with Stanford. With starting quar
terback l asani bit with an injury
during the game, backup ('.hi is
Lewis found Deßonnie Pitts, who
flipped over the end/one with less
than two minutes remaining to give
the Cardinal the shocking 27-24
win.
Stanford ended its season m ex
(iting fashion .is well. In the KKtrd
Big Came, the Cardinal made sure
tli.it another ( lass of seniors would
graduate from Stanford without los

the Bear players and securing the
Stanford victorv.

Kxcellence is the norm for the
Stanford men's and women's swim

no different.
Undefeated and brimming with
confidence, the No. 2 Cardinal
headed to College Station, Texas.
Ik>in March 22 to March 24, in
tending to unseat defending cham
pions Texas at the NCAA Men's
Swimming (Championships.
While the the Tonghorns pre
vailed, storing 597.5 points to Stan
ford's 457.5, the Cardinal had manv
highlights at the NCAA Champi
onships and throughout the season.

Ijed by a strong core of seniors —
Adam Messner, Steven Itrown and
Anthonv Robinson — and a pletho
ra of talented freshmen, the (Cardi
nal .k hieved it's 20th straight Pacific
I0( Conference title.
I he women finished the seasc m as
strong as tlieii m;de counterparts. In
the closest meet in NCAA histoid,
Stanford placed seconcl to the (Geor

Winning six of 21 events, the (Cardi

first ('.ordinal to capture the 3,000-

men's bock team win its first Pac-I0 title
since 1927.
Although it didn't repeat as
national champions, this year's
men's track team did something
even more difficult when it cap
tured the Pacific 10 Conference
title.
Because the Pac-10's scoring is
weighted against distance running,
Stanford's strength, the Cardinal
has always placed better at the
NCAAs than Pac-10s.
This year was the exception.
The Stanford men's middle dis
tance and distance runners stored
a staggering HI points out of the
team's 142 total, whit h topped de
fending champion Southern Cali
fornia's score of 136.
In addition to Thomas's 3000-
meter steeplechase title, junior
Cabe Jennings (3:43.30), fresh
man Don Sage (3:43.70), fresh
man Grant Robison (3:44.13) and
senior |onathon Riley (3:44.47)
finished a remarkable first
through-fourth sweep of the
1,500 meters. The Cardinal also
received individual Pac-10 titles
from sophomore Michael
Ponikvar in the high jump and se
nior Michael Stember in the 800

eighth inning as the ( '.animal sqweze

al\s on its wax to the ('.allege World Se

Nobody could have predicted
this. After a season in which the
Stanford baseball team had only
one returning starter, t In- (Cardinal
came <>ut .is strt>ng as e\ er this year,
eventually earning a No. 1 ranking
midwav through the season.
However, despite its early-sea
son success, on Sunday, May 27.
very few people would have pre
dicted that the Cardinal could
make it out of the NCAA Region
al. On that day, Stanford needed
to defeat the Texas Longhoi ns
twice to advance to the supei-re
gional the following week. A day
earlier, the (lardinal lost to Texas,
1-H, to create the uncomfortable
situation.
In the first game, Stanford
blew a 9-5 lead, and the game
was forced into extra innings. In
the bottom of the lOth. fresh
in. m Carlos Quentin proved to
be the game's hero, hitting a
bases-loaded RBI-single to light
field that stored junior Chris
(VRiordan to give the (lardinal a
10-9 win.
The Stanford heroics contin
ued in the second game when
Carko looped a bases-loaded two-

Longhorn second baseman I itn
Moss in the top of the eighth in
ning. scoring juniors Scott Drag

the (lardinal the 4-3 win. Stanford
had trailed 3-1 heading into the in
ning. but stored a run on .i satii
fice fl\ In (VRiordan to in.ike the
store .'i-'J before (iai kocamc to the
plate.
A week later, the Cardinal
needed three games to get bv the
South (larolina (»,unettwks to ad

vance to the ( lollege World Series.
()n June I, Stanford won the first
game easily, 10-9. South Carolina
bounced back the next day in a 4-H
victory to force a third and decid
ing game. I he (lardinal preserved
a .3-2 lead throughout the game to
take the victory and the College
World Series berth.

With less than four strands on the dock, sophomore
(Insey facobsen hits a dutch lay-aft as the men's basketball
team escapes the I'ete Next'ell Challenge with an S-t-SJ win
over No. I Duke.
At the beginning of the men's basketball season,
Duke and Arizona, with their incredible talent and
athleticism, were seen in a ( lass by themselves. Mite
teams like defending champion Michigan State,
perennial powerhouses North Carolina and Kansas,
and even Stanford, were relegated to second-tiet sta
tus.
Over winter break, the Cardinal proved everyone
wrong. On Dec. 21, in front of the largest < rowd evei

to watch a college basketball game in the state of Cal
ifornia, the then-No. .S ( ardinal overcame a 15-point
deficit in the second half to pull within one point of
the then-No. I Blue Devils with four seconds left.
That's when All-American Jacobsen put the game in
his own hands and hit a lay-up to give Duke its first
loss of the season.
A week later, the < iardinal traveled to the McKale
Center, where it hadn't seen a win in over four years,
to t.ike on the Arizona Wildcats. Stanford dismantled
the Wildcats on their home court with an H. r >-7(> victo
ry, which propelled the Cardinal to a No. I national
ranking.
Stanford finished its season by advancing to the
I lite l .ight of the NCAA I out nainent before falling to

Nobody could have predicted
this. After a season in which the
Stanford baseball team had only
one returning starter, t In- (Cardinal
came <>ut .is strt>ng as e\ er this year,
eventually earning a No. 1 ranking
midwav through the season.
However, despite its early-sea
son success, on Sunday, May 27.
very few people would have pre
dicted that the Cardinal could
make it out of the NCAA Region
al. On that day, Stanford needed
to defeat the Texas Longhoi ns
twice to advance to the supei-re
gional the following week. A day
earlier, the (lardinal lost to Texas,
1-H, to create the uncomfortable
situation.
In the first game, Stanford
blew a 9-5 lead, and the game
was forced into extra innings. In
the bottom of the lOth. fresh
in. m Carlos Quentin proved to
be the game's hero, hitting a
bases-loaded RBI-single to light
field that stored junior Chris
(VRiordan to give the (lardinal a
10-9 win.
The Stanford heroics contin
ued in the second game when
Carko looped a bases-loaded two-

Longhorn second baseman I itn
Moss in the top of the eighth in
ning. scoring juniors Scott Drag

the (lardinal the 4-3 win. Stanford
had trailed 3-1 heading into the in
ning. but stored a run on .i satii
fice fl\ In (VRiordan to in.ike the
store .'i-'J before (iai kocamc to the
plate.
A week later, the Cardinal
needed three games to get bv the
South (larolina (»,unettwks to ad

vance to the ( lollege World Series.
()n June I, Stanford won the first
game easily, 10-9. South Carolina
bounced back the next day in a 4-H
victory to force a third and decid
ing game. I he (lardinal preserved
a .3-2 lead throughout the game to
take the victory and the College
World Series berth.

With less than four strands on the dock, sophomore
(Insey facobsen hits a dutch lay-aft as the men's basketball
team escapes the I'ete Next'ell Challenge with an S-t-SJ win
over No. I Duke.
At the beginning of the men's basketball season,
Duke and Arizona, with their incredible talent and
athleticism, were seen in a ( lass by themselves. Mite
teams like defending champion Michigan State,
perennial powerhouses North Carolina and Kansas,
and even Stanford, were relegated to second-tiet sta
tus.
Over winter break, the Cardinal proved everyone
wrong. On Dec. 21, in front of the largest < rowd evei

to watch a college basketball game in the state of Cal
ifornia, the then-No. .S ( ardinal overcame a 15-point
deficit in the second half to pull within one point of
the then-No. I Blue Devils with four seconds left.
That's when All-American Jacobsen put the game in
his own hands and hit a lay-up to give Duke its first
loss of the season.
A week later, the < iardinal traveled to the McKale
Center, where it hadn't seen a win in over four years,
to t.ike on the Arizona Wildcats. Stanford dismantled
the Wildcats on their home court with an H. r >-7(> victo
ry, which propelled the Cardinal to a No. I national
ranking.
Stanford finished its season by advancing to the
I lite l .ight of the NCAA I out nainent before falling to

While the Stanford football team
didn't earn its second consecutive
Rose Bowl berth, ibis year's team
had nothing to be ashamed of. In an
up-and-down season, the Cardinal
finished a respectable fourth plate
iu tlir Pacific 10 Conference.
1 lie season began on a high note
on Sept. lb, when the Cardinal host
ed the No. 5 Texas Longhorns, a
team that demolished Stanford a
year earlier in Austin, Texas.
But the Cardinal, supported bv
miracle-maker I iger Woods, taught
the Longhorns a lesson: Don't inc-ss
with Stanford. With starting quar
terback l asani bit with an injury
during the game, backup ('.hi is
Lewis found Deßonnie Pitts, who
flipped over the end/one with less
than two minutes remaining to give
the Cardinal the shocking 27-24
win.
Stanford ended its season m ex
(iting fashion .is well. In the KKtrd
Big Came, the Cardinal made sure
tli.it another ( lass of seniors would
graduate from Stanford without los

Kxcellence is the norm for the

Undefeated and brimming with
confidence, the No. 2 Cardinal
headed to College Station, Texas.
Ik>in March 22 to March 24, in
tending to unseat defending cham

Swimming (Championships.
While the the Tonghorns pre
vailed, storing 597.5 points to Stan

highlights at the NCAA Champi
onships and throughout the season.

Ijed by a strong core of seniors —
Adam Messner, Steven Itrown and
Anthonv Robinson — and a pletho

Winning six of 21 events, the (Cardi

since 1927.
Although it didn't repeat as
national champions, this year's
men's track team did something
even more difficult when it cap
tured the Pacific 10 Conference
title.
Because the Pac-10's scoring is
weighted against distance running,
Stanford's strength, the Cardinal
has always placed better at the
NCAAs than Pac-10s.
This year was the exception.
The Stanford men's middle dis
tance and distance runners stored
a staggering HI points out of the
team's 142 total, whit h topped de

In addition to Thomas's 3000-

received individual Pac-10 titles
from sophomore Michael
