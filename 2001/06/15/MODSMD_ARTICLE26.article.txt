						DREAM RUNS THROUGH HIM
## 
### BETH GERMAN 
I r\ing to ir.uk clown Cabe Jennings is
like running .» rate against time. Soon he
will he oil to another big event, the hype of
tlu- Summer (iames will be over and he will
shut the <i<h >1 on Sydney.
"After this interview I'm not going to talk
about the 2000 Olympics anymore. I'm
going t<> talk about right now and my fu
ture. And my dreams," Jennings said.
An Olympic athlete and Stanford
standout, Jennings is an artist with the pas
sion and energy to sculpt those dreams
into reality. Driven by drumbeats and a
deep innci determination, he competes
with himself both on and oil the track.
2000 was .1 breakout season — he cap
tured the N( lAA(championships in the in
door mile and then matched it with the
NCAA title.
Hut Jennings's crowning moment c aim
in |une at the U.S. Olympic I rials, where
he topped a strong field to win the 1,500-
meter run, a< hieving his personal best lime
ol minutes, 35.90 seconds to earn a spot
on the U.S. team.
At the ()lympics in September,Jennings
made it to the semifinal round ot the 1,500
before finishing ninth and missing the final.
I hese accomplishments, though, are mere
building bloc ks for his greater goals.
1 hrough the looking glass of Sydney,
)ennings opened his eves to wider possi
bilities for I he 112 uture. Pushing himself to
new extremes, Jennings put on his game
face. ()nce lie arrived in Australia, near
ly a month before the starter's gun
would go off, life became a torturous
wailing game.
"I was like a prisoner inside the
Olvmpic village with securitx guards .ill
around. I he village was ,i ghost town of
walking dead. Athletes with all
.ind nervous energy. I hey weren't alive. I
saw glimpses of life but only in competi
tion. I lie place reeked of fear. You see a
lot ol people that underachieve .it the
( Mympic seven though they've done all the
right training. When they get there, they
overthink it. I was one of those. But I've
learned from my mistakes and I 'm moving
on. This c ross-country season and school
war, I'm starting fresh."
I hough his event is an individual com
petition, he feels a greater c alling of ca
maraderie when he wins. "I'm not nation
alistic and I don't like that aspect ol the
Olympics. It's about the human spirit. I
respect all of my competitors no matter
what jersev or color skin tliev have or how

they run or look. Its just different peo pie
with different strengths and weaknesses
coming together.
"1 don't race well unless I have that re
spect," said Jennings. "I need to tap into the
energy level of my competitors. I need to
love them and race to their level. II they're
younger, less experienced competitors I
hope they will raise it to mine. We're all try
ing to reach our potential."
Now Jennings is back in his comfort
/one at Stanford, the place he calls home.
I lis track teammates embrace him as a
brother, while Chi I beta Chi, the co-op
w here he lives, welcomes him as family.
" I o us lie's just '(iabe,' said track and
field co-captain (onathon Riley, one ol his
comrades from Ins high school glorv clays.
"I'm verv happy to see his dreams material
ize. li.uk m lngli school he always s.iul he
would bean ()l\ inpian ... I les always gone
to extremes, even through injuries, lie's al
ways given 100 percent."
Jonathan Stevens, another track team
mate, recalled one Pacific 10 Conference
meet at Oregon where Jennings rallied
the Stanford team into a positive /one.
"Cabe got me to buy a tambourine," said
Stevens. "All of us had a ihvtlunu vibe
going during the event. Jennings is
known to orchestrate such cheering sec
tions .ind had a large pen iissic >n sec tion ol
friends and family armed with drums to
keep a (licet ing beat.
A musk major on (lie Farm, Jennings
maintains strong lies between Ins athletic
ambitions, academic sand campus life-. "I in
st.n ting lo recogni/e the intc-rconnec lion ol
m\ activities. Drumming is ,i form ol en
duraiK e. as is i mining.'
\i the Rhythmic I louse, as ( hi I beta
(ihi is known to its residents, music (liinics
throughout the Spanish-st\ le villa, while a
triangle sounds the dinnci bell. I'lie co-op
is the perlcc I pl.u e loi |ennings. It feeds his
soul and spii it.
Doing the dishes m the kitchen, he
started an impromptu band session,
banging on pot sane I pans with c hopstic ks.
Soon the kitchen translormcd into a
music room .is (lic-c-se gratei s bee anie ti i
anglcs; containers, bag pipes; and kettles,
steel drums.
I he interview took place while Jennings
relaxed in his favorite thinking spot, a sweat
lodge he built lnnisell in die (o-op's back
yarcl. Reminiscent ol an upbringing filled
with music , big dreams and values. Chi
I lu-ta Chi is a place containing childhood
inenioiies. a colotful tire sw'nfg. la><* h.itn
liKx ks and a vegetable garden. Tomatoes

and mint leaves picked fresh become part
ol the dinner ritual.
Jennings was raised and honie-si hoolecl
in a remote region of Northern California
called Forks of Salmon. Growing up with
out mcxleru conveniences such as television
and indoor plumbing, his family ate what
they grew from the hat k garden and gen
erated their own electricity using hydro
electric and solar power.
During this time, Jennings's parents in
stilled values of haul work and a do-it-your
self'mentality in their oldest child, leath
ers, the\ ran .1 two-room m hoolhouse with
!V r > to r»0 pupils drawing from the 200 or so
people thai lived within a 100-mile radius of
Klamath National 112 orest.
A runnei since childhood, Jennings re
lated the st on of Ins first taste of Competi
tion: "1 losi 1 ]i\ Hi si 1 ,i< c when I was five. We
( ailed 11 .1 111.11.1111* >11 .ill hough il was .u tual
ly a mile, .1 < om st- around mv school, fora
little kid Ih.lt s .1 long wa\ and it had a big
hill .it the end. I got beat.
"li was that first si 1 uggle and defeat that
I turned into a victory because it drove me
to work hardci I started running to school
after that loss. 1 never lost another
marathon. It was called the River
Olympus: .1 commuuitv of schools along
the Salmon River.
" I Il.lt was my fii st taste of competition,
and 11 u.is .1 11 ue < oniniunity experience.
It was tli.u community support and
pareiHal support that 1 loved. And it stuck
with me."

|ennings took .idxantage of the tnan\
resourecs before him. and ii wasn't long
before his natural athletic abilities guided
him to victoix. As an eighth-grader, he
finished second at the National llershev
I rack and 112 ield meet in Pennsylvania
and won nine state lilies in Wisconsin. I lis
athletic talents, combined with strong ac a
demic s. earned him a scholarship to Stan

dream, and if you re gonna dream, dream
big. Don't dream defeat, don't dream
nightmares, otherwise tliev might come
true. So I'm dreaming right now and I'm
enjoying it. Reaching that next level will
take a lot of hard work and a beginner s
mind. I have so much to learn."
