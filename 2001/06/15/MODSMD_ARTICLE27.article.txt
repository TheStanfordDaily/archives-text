NCAA Singles Finals lo her teammate,
top-ranked Lama Granville.
Kalvaria fell in that matt h, 0-S, 7-0,
forcing a tiehrcakei in the second set.
I hat's it. though â€” just lour losses. And
39 wins.
Kalvaria held the No. 2 position on
the team behind Granville, a sophomore
who also won the 2000 NC.AA Singles
(championship.
I wo vears ago, Kalvaria was lourth on
the team behind Cabriela Lastra, then a
fellow freshman.
Since then, Kalvaria has ( limbed from
barely cracking the rankings to now
being ninth in the nation. Karlier in the
season, she was ranked as high as No. 7,
but it was in the postseason that she
shincd.
In the team championships, Kalvaria
was Stanford's most consistent plaver. She
knocked of! Wake Forest's 19th-ranked
| a net Bergman, 6-1, b-.'t, on May 17, de
feated Karin Palme of Arizona State, 0-1,
0-2, the following day and returned on

I he sweetest victory came on May 21 in
the championship match, when Kalvaria
sealed the title for Stanford by defeating
No. .'W Sarah Riskeof Vanderbilt in a solid
0-2, 6-2 decision.
Kalvaria also found success on the
doubles courts, teaming up with fresh

"[Kalvaria] has had an unbelievable sea
son," said junior co-captain Keiko Toku
da. "She is definitely an inspiring individ
ual and has come a long way, from fresh
man year playing No. 4 behind [lustra]
and barely ranked that year, to the [cur

rent | No. 2 position and cssentialh N0.2 in
(lie nation."
I lie ct onoinic s majoi's hot pl.iv in the
postseason culminated in the NC.AA Sin
gles Fin.lis, when she fought a hard battle
against (iranville.
Forcing a tiebreaker against Granville,
who earlier in the season set an NCAA
record for most consecutive singles victo
i ies, was ,i strong effort for Kalvaria, espe
ciallv considering that Cranville is her
teammate.
"It is hard not to have mixed emotions
plaving someone you know," C.ranville
said after the match.
Kalvai i.i usually took ,i backstage role to
her team's gloi\, but even there she met
with acclaim. She and Barnikow were
named the Pacific 10 Conference Doubles
I earn of the Year, and Kalvaria made first
team all Pa< -10.
On May SI, Kalvaria and Cranville
were named to the 2001 I SA I ennis Col
legiate l eant, an honor bestowed upon
only 10 other women in the nation.

States I ennis Association and the Intercol
legiate I ennis Association, the program is
designed to provide plavers with valuable
exposure to the professional circuit in a
team-oriented environment. The team
will begin play on June IH.
"(Lauren) has been such a role model
and friend to me these past two years. She
was the leader of our Stanford (hampi
onship team. I congratulate her for an in
credible season." Granville said.
Though Granville has announced
plans to turn professional, Kalvaria plans
on returning for her senior season. If Stan
ford makes another run at a title next sea
son, she may have the chance to avenge
last year's NC.AA title defeat in her dream
match against Georgia.
"Kalvaria has had a wonderful tour
nament." said Stanford's first-year
head coach Lele Forood. "She's shown
people that she's moved to the next
level."
