It helps to have a parent who under
stands the rigoi s of competition. loin's f.i

ther, Ricardo, was a two-time player of the
year in Brazil and assistant coach for the
1996 U.S. (Mympic team. Tony got his first
taste for the high level of international
competition in 1996, when he worked tor
his father as a ball boy.
"It was at the 1996 Summer Games
when I decided 1 had to make it," Tony
said.
Ricardo introduced his son to water
polo after the family moved to Southern
(California. Growing up in Long Beach was
the perfect setting tor a natural athlete like
l ony to excel in many sports, including
football, basketball, baseball and volleyball.
I actually got to be a pretty good base
ball player, but one dav I jumped into the
water and that was it,"he said.
By ninth grade, A/evedo turned his en
tire fix us to water polo .is his father built a
dvnastv coaching at I.ong Beach Wilson
High School. In November I'.)'.''.'. Wilson
became the first team in 20 vears to capture
four consecutive (California large-school ti
tles. Father and son were together for
three of the four championships — Ric ar
do left to become head coach at Long
Beach State in 1998.
"My dad's been my coach forever,"
A/evedo said. "He never pushed me; we've
always had a great relationship. I just got to
love the sport by watching him."
A/evedo was a four-time sectional MVP
at Wilson, and his numbers there are un
surpassed. He scored 113 goals in three
vears and added 100 goals halfwav
through lus senior year before leaving to
join the national team.
"It was good practice for where I'm .it
now," he said. "1 had to stav creative and
think against the high school guys and
work on my strength against the bigger
players on the national team."
During his senior year of high school,
A/evedo decided to attend Stanford after
he was finished playing in Sydney. Spend
ing time on classwork, hanging out with
friends and surfing in his time away from
the pool, A/evedo is already loving life on
campus.
"It's fantastic to lie here, a really great
experience. I'm among players that I re
spect," he said.
A/evedo based his decision to attend
Stanford on its status as one of the top pro
grams in the country and on its inspiring
coach. Dettamanti's plans to retire in 2002

have been postponed at least until Azevedo
graduates.
Named the NCAA, Coach of the Year
five times, Dettamanti is one of the most
successful coaches in the league, produc
ing both NCAA championship teams and
Olympic athletes. During his 23-year
tenure, he has led the Cardinal to seven
NCAA titles and to a national top-four fin
ish on 19 occasions. He will be the U.S.
head coach at the World University Cames
this summer and has applied to be the
water polo coach for the U.S. in the Sum
mer Cames of 2004.
"I'm not leaving; there's too much to
look forward to in the next few years," Det
tamanti said.
Water polo is the oldest Olympic team
sport, and Azevedo is proving to be a team
player. While Azevedo has decided to red
shirt his freshman season, he is just as ded
icated to practicing as he is to playing. This
decision allows Azevedo to adjust to school
and gives him a break after playing for two
straight years on the national team.
"We need him to stay fresh," Dettaman
ti said.
At 6-foot-1 and 193 lbs., Azevedo isn't
the biggest player in the water, but he
might be the smartest. Even though he's
just a freshman, lie's already leading by ex
ample, winning over his older teammates
by helping out in the water, practicing after
hours and always having a positive atti
tude.
"Being an Olympian hasn't gone to his
head; he truly cares about his teammates
and the sport," said Ben Quittner, Stan
lord's assistant coach and a former mem
ber of the powerhouse Hungarian nation
al team.
Coalie Nick Ellis remarked, "Tony's
style of play has been impressed upon all of
us. He has an amazing vision of the pool.
He's the most complete player I've ever
seen."
Though Azevedo's decision to attend
Stanford meant turning down a European
contract with endorsements that would
have exceeded $100,000, his relaxed Cali
fornia attitude shines through.
"The time will come for that," he said.
"It's better to get a degree. I will definitely
play professionally. I have so many g<x>d
years ahead."
