# Tom returns from Sydney with more heroics in store
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Logan Tom is a woman of
mystery.
No one was sure it loin would
play tor the Stanford women's vol
leyball team this year. In tact, most
people assumed slit' would not
play for Stanford during her
sophomore year, having just fin
ished playing with the I .S. nation
al team at the Summer Olympics
in Sydney.
Fven loin herself had vet to de
cide it she would play this season as
she sat on the team's bench in
Maples Pavilion two weeks ago
watching Iter teammates take on
Washington.
She had arrived on campus
only hours earlier, returning to
the Farm tor the first time since
she left during winter quarter last
year to start training with the Na
tional Team.
So everyone was naturally sur
prised to see Tom in uniform, with
her trademark No. 15 on her back,
on the court against California
onl\ four davs later. ()f course, no
one was surprised that she posted
a match-high 17 kills in her first
game back tor Stanford while lead
ing the (Cardinal to a 3-0 victory.
" I here were a bunch of differ
ent options," loin said of return
ing after the ()lvmpics. "Not com
ing back .ind taking the fall off was
one of them. Coining b.u k and red
shirting and coming back and
plaving were the other ones.
1 think 1 could maybe use
some time off, but I get bored real
ly easilv, so after a week or two I
would be like,'(»ive me something
to do.' 1 was going to be here any
way, and I'm not one to sit around
and watch."
Her propensity tor boredom is
great news to the other members
of the Stanford squad, who are
more than happ\ that loin is back
out on the (<>in t witli them.
"Logan brings this team a go-to
hitter." said the team's captain, se
nior Lindsay Kagawa. "She's

someone we're not necessarily
going to rely on, but she brings us
stability at the outside position and
gives this team a confidence boost
on the court."
Tom's return to Stanford
ended an eight month journey for
the outside hitter from Salt Lake
( itv, during which she established
herself as one of the premiere fe
male volleyball players in the
country. She had already estab
lished herself at the collegiate level
after her breakout season for the
Cardinal last year.
During her freshman cam
paign. she became only the fourth
freshman in NCAA history to be
named a first-team All-American
and was voted Volleyball Maga
zine's Freshman of the Year.
I think she's the number one
college player in the country," said
interim head coach Denise Cor
lett. "She's got the hitting ability,
the range, and she's one of the bet
ter blocking outside hitters in the
game. She'll definitely go clown as
one of the best players in NCAA
history."
Perhaps even as one of the best
players ever. Font's performance
in Sydney has led many to com
pare her to Karcli Kiraly, widely
accepted as the best men's volley
ball player in U.S. history. Despite
an auspicious start to her collegiate
and international careers, Tom is
quick to shun those kinds of com
ments.
"1 tend to ignore those things,"
she said. "I play volleyball. It's
something I'm not really thinking
about. Fin basically taking things
one step at a time."
I om was no stranger to inter
nation.il play before this summer.
She toured overseas with the Ju
nior National 'Team several times
during high school, starting her
freshman year, which is especially
remarkable considering that she
did not start playing volleyball
until the eighth grade.
"It was basically a way to pass the
time in eighth grade," she said.
I bis past spring, a mere six

years after picking up the sport,
Tom found herself embarking on a
pre-Olympic tour with the Ameri
can squad thai took her to all cor
ners ot the globe, including Russia,
the Netherlands, Switzerland and
China. Soon after, she found her
self at the Summer (Mympics is Syd
ney, where the magnitude of the
experience really began to sink in.
"Walking around the Olympic
village is weird, 'cause you're like,
'Wow, there's an Olympian,' but
then you realize, 'Wait, I'm an
Olympian too,' " Tom said.
"It hit me a little bit while 1 was
there with the opening cere
monies and the first match. But it's
really hit me afterwards, realizing
1 was part of something so huge in
the world."
Tom's breakthrough perfor
mance in Sydney highlighted the
American team's remarkable run
for.i medal, which eventually fell
just short. With upset wins over
(Ihina in pool play and a huge win
over the favored Koreans in the
quarterfinals, the U.S. squad went
further than anyone expected.
Many observers look ahead at
the impact Tom could have on the
game of volleyball in general. Cor
lett, who played on the U.S. Na
tional ream in 1982 and 1983 and
remains involved with USA Vol
leyball, sees Tom as the center
piece of the sport in America in the
years to come.
"1 think she's volleyball's fu
ture," Corlett said. "In order for
the sport to get publicity, she has to
be the one they use to get it out
into the public eye. I think she can
do for volleyball what Mia Hamm
has done tor soccer in America."
For now, Tom is more con
cerned with getting adjusted to
being back at school.
"Being gone tor so long, it's
hard getting back into things, but
I'm getting there," Tom said. "I
don't even have my stufl here yet.
I need my TV and my stereo."

She had arrived on campus

"Logan brings this team a go-to

someone we're not necessarily
going to rely on, but she brings us
stability at the outside position and
gives this team a confidence boost
on the court."
Tom's return to Stanford
ended an eight month journey for
the outside hitter from Salt Lake
( itv, during which she established
herself as one of the premiere fe
male volleyball players in the
country. She had already estab
lished herself at the collegiate level
after her breakout season for the
Cardinal last year.
During her freshman cam
paign. she became only the fourth
freshman in NCAA history to be
named a first-team All-American
and was voted Volleyball Maga

I think she's the number one
college player in the country," said
interim head coach Denise Cor
lett. "She's got the hitting ability,
the range, and she's one of the bet

game. She'll definitely go clown as
one of the best players in NCAA
history."
Perhaps even as one of the best
players ever. Font's performance
in Sydney has led many to com
pare her to Karcli Kiraly, widely
accepted as the best men's volley
ball player in U.S. history. Despite
an auspicious start to her collegiate
and international careers, Tom is
quick to shun those kinds of com
ments.
"1 tend to ignore those things,"
she said. "I play volleyball. It's
something I'm not really thinking
about. Fin basically taking things
one step at a time."
I om was no stranger to inter
nation.il play before this summer.
She toured overseas with the Ju
nior National 'Team several times
during high school, starting her
freshman year, which is especially
remarkable considering that she
did not start playing volleyball
until the eighth grade.
"It was basically a way to pass the
time in eighth grade," she said.
I bis past spring, a mere six

years after picking up the sport,
Tom found herself embarking on a
pre-Olympic tour with the Ameri
can squad thai took her to all cor
ners ot the globe, including Russia,
the Netherlands, Switzerland and
China. Soon after, she found her
self at the Summer (Mympics is Syd
ney, where the magnitude of the
experience really began to sink in.
"Walking around the Olympic
village is weird, 'cause you're like,
'Wow, there's an Olympian,' but
then you realize, 'Wait, I'm an
Olympian too,' " Tom said.
"It hit me a little bit while 1 was
there with the opening cere
monies and the first match. But it's
really hit me afterwards, realizing
1 was part of something so huge in
the world."
Tom's breakthrough perfor
mance in Sydney highlighted the
American team's remarkable run
for.i medal, which eventually fell
just short. With upset wins over
(Ihina in pool play and a huge win
over the favored Koreans in the
quarterfinals, the U.S. squad went
further than anyone expected.
Many observers look ahead at
the impact Tom could have on the
game of volleyball in general. Cor

remains involved with USA Vol
leyball, sees Tom as the center
piece of the sport in America in the
years to come.
"1 think she's volleyball's fu
ture," Corlett said. "In order for
the sport to get publicity, she has to
be the one they use to get it out
into the public eye. I think she can
do for volleyball what Mia Hamm
has done tor soccer in America."
For now, Tom is more con
cerned with getting adjusted to
being back at school.
"Being gone tor so long, it's
hard getting back into things, but
I'm getting there," Tom said. "I
don't even have my stufl here yet.
I need my TV and my stereo."
