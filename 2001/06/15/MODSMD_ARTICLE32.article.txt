# McDonald:
## Stanford's best kept secret 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
Senior point guard Michael Mc-
I )onal(l is used to being overshadowed.
lake high school tor example.
While most highly touted basketball
players are the "Big Men ()n (lamptis"
dt their respective high schools, Mc-
Donald was just one of many talented
Long Beach Poly graduates — a list
that includes rapper Snoop Dogg, ac
tress Cameron Diaz, tennis great Billie
|ean King, baseball superstar lonv
(.wvnn and current Stanford cjuarter
back Chris Lewis.
When M< Donald came to Stanford
four years ago, the spotlight remained
on Ins predecessoi s Brevin Knight and
Artlnii Lee, the two most lamous point
guards in Cardinal history, while Mc -
Donald waited patiently in the hack
grc nind.
Lven today, after leading the No. I
Stanford men's basketball team to its
third straight Pacific 10 Conference
title, M< Donald continues to be over
shadowed In his fellow starters.
Am Cardinal fan could tell you
which Collins twin is older (Jason, In
eight minutes), or how many con sec u
tive free throws Rvan Mencle/ made to
break tlu- Pac-10 record (49), or Casey
Jacobsen's shooting range (as soon as
he crosses half court). But very few
would know that Mc Donald leads the
Pac-10 in 3-point shooting (."•(>()) and
assist-to-turnover ratio (3.4), two kc\
reasons whv the (Cardinal is primed to
t.ike home its first national champi
onship in over 50 years.
I he media overlooks McDonald as
well. Before the season started, he was
called the weak link on an otherwise
talented starting five. Mc Donald's crit
ics c laimed he lacked a scorer's mindset
and could not defend well against
<|iii( ker guards.
Mc Donald has responded well to
the criticism.
"II I'm the weak link on (his team, I
II nil k I'll take it,"he said. "We have
some great players on our team -
Casey |acobsen, the twins. Ryan
Mendez — they're all wonderfill shoot
ers, so [other teams| are not uoing to

leave those guys open. If they leave me
open, 1 think I've been doing a good
job this year being a threat on the of
fensive end and playing pretty good
[defense]."
"A good job" is an understatement
of how much Mc Donald's game has
improved this season. The numbers
never lie. A career .329 percent field
goal shooter before the season started,
Mc Donald has raised that figure to
.494. Kven more impressive is McDon
ald's 3-point shooting this season. He
has shot an astonishing .500 from be
hind the arc, up from .347 a year ago.
"I don't think I've changed my play
too much." McDonald said. "1 just
think I've been open fora lot more
shots. I've been able to hit those shots a
lot more than I have in the past. Any
time you hit more shots, you gain a lot
of confidence."
Now tli.it McDonald leads the Pac
-10 in 3-point shooting, one can only
wonder how he slacks up with team
mates Jacobscn and Mi ndez, twoof the
most prolific 3-point shooters in Stau
fbrcl historv. Mendez and |acobsen's
games of 11( )RSL during practice are
historic, I>in have the) allowed Stan
ford's newest 3-point threat to join in
on the lun?
According i<> McDonald, "I beat
Menclein 11( )RSI. freshman veai twice,
and lie won't pla\ me am more. I don't
plav ( '.asev bee ausc he shoots from too
far back all the time, [seven-foot center
Jason Collins] talks a lot of trash about
winning [a game of] HORSK, but he
can't handle any of us."
()l course, there are two sides to
every story, and Jacobsen's take is a lit
tle different.
"\'eah, I've plaved [Mc Donald in
HORSK], and I beat him everv time
and so does Mencle," Jacobsen said.
"Me .md Rvan always tease Mike\ that,
'[()pposing teams] just leave vou open,
Mikey, so of course you're going to
slio(»t 50 percent with noboch on \ou.
11 the other teams let ns shoot open
threes, we'd be shooting as good .is
you.'"
But, |acobsen will still give credit
where credit is due.
"The difference now is I that Mc-

Donald is] a confident shooter," Jacob
sen said. "Last year, lie would shoot,
but maybe two or three times a game.
You come and watch our games now,
and lie does not hesitate when he's
shooting. He really feels that he can
make that shot, and he has now be
come one of our biggest, strongest,
most consistent weapons from the out
side, .md that's been another aspect
that we've needed and will continue to
need later on in the season."
McDonald has also proven the c rit
ics wrong with bis tight man-to-man
defense this season against some of the
best point guards in the nation.
In last Thursday's 7(>-7. r ) heart
breaker to No. 8 Arizona, for example,
McDonald contained |ason (iardner,
the Wildcats' talented point guard, to
1 2-of-7 shooting.
Now that Mc Donald has shown he
has the abilit\ to compete against fu
ture NBA stars like (iardner, the- cjucs
tion remains il McDonald himself will
test the NBA ranks once the season is
over.
"1 don't reallv think about am of
that stuff," McDonald said. "I II think
about that stnll latei it it happens. But
right now, I'm |nst trving to I<k us on
winning this tournament in a couple
weeks."
but that doesn't mean McDonald
hasn't thought about his future.
"I'm either to stav next vear
and co-term in [sociology] or go some
where and pla\ [basketball]," Mc Don
ald said. "Those are basicalk niv two
options right now because I don't think
1 want to head out to the working
world right now.
"Mv interest is to make some nionev
any way, anv how," he added.
"Whether it's marketing, ending up
going to law school, being a sports
agent or what not, I'll figure out some
wav how to make some nionev."
Wherevei McDonald makes his
nionev, one thing's for certain: If he
can lead the ('.ardinal to the Final FOlll
111 the next lew weeks, 110 one will ever
overlook linn auaiu.
