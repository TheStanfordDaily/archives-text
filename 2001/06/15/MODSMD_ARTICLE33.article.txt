### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
(arolvn M<h)s aiul Sarah Dimson looked across the
table ti'oin one .mother in their dining hall early in the
I.ill of their freshman season and saw that their indi
vidual philosophies would gel just tine.
We |ust said to each other, It kind of bothers me
that people come to off-season practice a little late,' "
Moos said. "I rom the very beginning, we were on the
same page, in terms of what we expected, in terms of
work ethic."
loin vears later, on the eve of their final game,
Moos and Dimson are still working every bit as hard.
\t first glance, these two seem an unlikely pair.
Moos, a 6-f(H)t-6 lanky blond from Minnesota, is a
powerful inside player, whose shot-blocking and con
sistent storing in the paint have given Stanford a lift
throughout her tenure. Dimson, a toned African
American from Oklahoma, stands at a much shorter
six leet. 1 he wing player boasts quickness and athleti
cism iliat allow her to defend against the Pac-l()'s
strongest guards.
I lowever, appearances are deceiving. I he two re
maining players from a four-player recruiting class
that also included \aila Moselv and Karesa Grander
son, Moos and Dimson have shown through their ded
i( ation to the Stanford squad that they are more simi
lar than some would think.
Moos broke out with a strong individual perfor
mance her sophomore season. After playing behind
the likes of Heather Owen and Olympia Scott
throughout her freshman campaign, she was really
called upon to captain the post position in her second
year. She led the team in rebounding (0.7 rpg) and
bloc ked shots (4(>), while averaging 12.9 points per
game, good for All-I'ac-10 Honorable Mention hon
ors.
Last \ ear. Moos simply continued from where she
had left off, averaging team highs in scoring and re
bounding, while earning All-I'ac-10 Honorable Men
tion Ik >ii( >is again.
Moos'\ final year at the Farm has had its tips and
downs, .iikl while she has started in 25 of the Cardi
nal s 29 games, her storing average and rebounding
average are somewhat under what they have been in
recent seasons. However, the senior's contributions
have nevei been questioned, and there have been sev
eral games. m< >st notably Saturday's win over Arizona
State, where she lias contributed critical points and
provided a strong defensive presence when the Cardi
nal needed it most.
Lverv year has had it's own character," Moos said.
\oyear has been the same, and no year has been pre
clit table."
I )imson has made a similiarly strong impression on
the Cardinal basketball court. As a freshman, she
played in 22 games â€” the highest of any first-year

player. Like Mt>os, she emerged as a sophomore, start
ing in 23 of the team's 25 games, while finishing sec
ond in the Pac-1() and first on the team in field goal
percentage. Dimson continued to post a strong field
goal percentage throughout the remainder of her ca
reer and, coming into her senior season, owned two of
the top 10 single-season percentages in school history.
How ever, Dimson's true value as a player cannot be
seen in the statistics but rather in her tenacious defense
and critical rebounding. Her intense style of play
boosts the energy of her teammates on the court. This
season, with the Cardinal forced to play without a true
guard on its roster, Dimson has stepped up and de
fended the quickest guard on each opposing team.
A strong student-athlete, Dimson has also graced
other Stanford organizations with her dedication and
hard work, serving as one of four class presidents dur
ing her sophomore year.
I eam-wise, Moos and Dimson's four vears at Stan
ford have been a topsy-turvy roller coaster title that
neither one expected when she signed with head
coach lata VanDerveer. While, individually, both
players have defined themselves as strong fixtures to
the Stanford program, neither player has ever been
part of a Final Four squad, which would not have
been the case in 1997 w hen going to the Final Four
seemed synonymous with the choice to come to the
Farm.
"When you come to a place like Stanford, you al
most expect to make it there," Dimson said. "It has
been hard, especially this being my senior year, and
you have one last chance to get to the Final Four. I al
ways tell younger players, 'Don't let it be your senior
year and you haven't gotten to a Final Four vet.' "
While both seniors have already capped off their
season with a share of the Pac-10 title, they are eager to
get one more shot at the NCAA Tournament. But
even with the conference title and a tournament bid,
the injuries to guards Susan King and Jamie Carev
have made this season much more difficult for Stan
ford.
"It has been extremeh tough," Dimson said of her
turbulent senior year. "Our team has been through
the trenches both physically, mentally and emotional
ly, but we're peaking at the right time, and we have a
lot more to show."
"When you have goals, you don't let go of them,"
Moos adtled. "And, while it has been a tough year,
people have stepped up and played their new posi
tions. But in terms of having the Final Four as a goal,
you don't let go until its gone, and its not gone vet."
St) what's in store for the senior women as their bas
ketball careers come to an entlr Both say they would
welcome the chance to plav in the WNBA, should the
opportunity arise. While Moos moves immediatelv
from the college game to pro tryouts, which com
mence the week after the Final Four, Dimson wants to
finish up her academic work at Stanford before she

tackles anything else. She plans on spending next year
at the Farm finishing np her science, technology and
society major, while co-terming in sociology.
However, while both players are reach to move on
in life, that doesn't make parting with the Cardinal bas
ketball team any easier. 1 he days they spent sweating
in the gy m perfecting their play and doing what each
of them does best, working hard, will not soon be for
ge >tten.
"There is a certain atmosphere about Stanford, and

about women's basketball," Dimson said. " I here are a
lot of expectations and it's really fun. When it comes
down to it, 1 am going to miss the people 1 have had
such great experiences with.
"A lot of little experiences, especially with team
mates, add up to a bigger feeling," Moos said. "I am be
ginning to realize that it is more the collective feelings
you get from every single experience. It's been great."
