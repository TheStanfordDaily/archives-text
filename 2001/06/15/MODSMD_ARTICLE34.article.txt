channel that same warrior spirit onto the

sliced through the opposing offense to

two sat ks and forced tumble slew the I 10-
j.ins in an upset aimehack win, . He
brought the sword this season when he at
tacked then-No. f> Texas and came away
with four tackles for losses and three sacks,
garnering the I SA Today I'.ic-KK Confer
ence Player of the Week award.
The sword Johnson totes to cat li game
is the medium version of a three-part set
given to him In his older brother Ahmani,
w 110 was a standout at linebacker tor ()re
gon State and went on to play several years

in the Canadian Football League. The
swords have become a sort of family heir
loom, hut no one will mistake the f> H , 240
pound Johnson fora native of Japan.
"[Ahmani] played 'Sam' backer, which
is what 1 play, and at his school they called
it samurai hacker,' Johnson explains. 1
like to think of football as going to war. To
me [the swords are] something to help get
your mind right, to get that warrior men
tality."
Johnson's most notable role on the bat
tlefield is that of quarterback-slayer. Last
year, he led the conference with IS sacks
and was decorated as second-team All-Pac
-10.
I his season he is on pace to beat that
total, with eight sacks after six games. ()p
-posing coaches have begun specially
preparing their offenses to deal with
Riall's onslaught — but usually to no avail.
"Vou have to figure out some way to
contain and stop him," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "He finds a
new wa\ every week to get to the quarter
back."
Johnson s success is partly due to a po
sition ( hange before last season, where he
moved from defensive end to outside line
backer. The 'Sam' backer is a position that
better suits fiis quickness and anticipation
than the defensive line.
Willingham praised the hard work
|ohnson put into perfecting his defensive
adjustment —yet it shouldn't be surpris
ing, given that Johnson always holds liini
sell to high standards.
"Personally, I want to go back to the
Rose Bowl. That's the first thing," said
Johnson. "I'm hoping to go for All-Ameri
can. Tin going for the Butkus Trophy
[given annually to the nation's best line
t>.u ker). I'm still on the list for it; if not then
at least I set my goals high. If Tin close
enough then I'll still be satisfied."
llis competitiveness is natural, given
that he grew up in a family of elite athletes.
Hoi ii in Lvnwood, Wash., Johnson
watched Ins older brother dominate on
the field, providing a basis for his own ex
cellence.
"I would not be as good a football play
er if it wasn't for my older brother," John
son said. "He's my inspiration and my
hero, lie's who I watched growing up.
Other people had pro players, but I had
someone close to me to model myself

after."
Being raised in Ahmani s shadow in
stilled a tire in Johnson to surpass his
brother. That flame has now been passed
on to Rialls little brother, 1 eyo, though
the (i' 7", 256-pound Stanford freshman
can hardly be called little. I eyo was a
prized recruit both as a quarterback and as
a forward on the basketball team, and Riall
was instrumental in feyo's decision to join
the Cardinal.
"It has helped me discipline myself
being here at Stanford, s;iit 1 Riall. \ou
realize you have to be on top of evei \ thing,
you're on your own here; you re not pam
pered like you are .it other schools. I hat s
one of the reasons 1 told my little brother
to come here, cause 1 wanted him to be
able to experience this."
Riall s competitiveness definitely ex
tends beyond the playing field. He loves
video games and is open to challengers.
But be forewarned, he admits that those
on the football team know him as the
"Camemaster." Rialls camaraderie with
his brother this season has matured both
players, and Riall c itcs 1 eyo s presence as
a mental advantage to his performance,
providing a c ha nee to relax more than in
past seasons.
"It's a lot more fun having him here I his
year on the team, Riall said. We remi
nisce on old childhood stnfl and 1 m goof
ing around in practice a lot more I think.
But I'm still staying focused."
So far this year has been challenging for
Riall and the entire Cardinal squad, as
they have failed to live up to their own ex
pectations so far, coming off their Rose-
Bowl year. But the talented Johnson ex
pects great things for himself on the grid
iron not only in the remainder of this sea
son, but also in the years that follow. He
cannot help but think of the future and the
opportunities awaiting him in his profes
sional career.
"I focus on the now but 1 do keep the
future in mind, because knowing what 1
could do in the future can help motivate
me for what I can do now," Johnson said.
What he can do now is continue to con
quer the line of scrimmage, as offenses fall
to the sharp linebacker that slashes into
their backfield with the power and deter
mination of a samurai.
