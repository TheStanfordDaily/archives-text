# Zapala continues to shine in coal for Card
## Cardinal will miss all-star goalkeeper 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting out with an impressive 8-0-1
record this season, the Stanford men's s<x
cer team has managed to give up only one
goal so far this season. In N(.AA soccer,
that's what you call an amazing run.
The reason?
Look no further than the rough grass in
front of the goal mouth.
Coming from nearby Cupertino, goalie
Adam Zapala arrived at Stanford in 1996
only to sit out his first year. A year later as
a redshirt freshman, he started to make his
mark on Cardinal soccer by playing every
minute of the season.
Zapala made an impression by putting
up some very impressive numbers. Facing
56 shots that season, he allowed only 14
goals while earning a school record-tying
12 shutouts, giving him a goals-against-av
erage of 0.66, the second lowest in Stan
ford history. Also within that first season,
Zapala managed to break another school
record with seven consecutive shutouts,
blanking the Cardinal's opponents for 763
minutes in a row at one point.
"Apart from being a great goal keeper
and being able to stop shots, Adam has a
great feeling for the game," said head
coach Bobby Clark. "He acts as a leader at

not onlv the back of the- defense, but the
entire team."
At the end of the season Zapala received
a slew of honors for his efforts, being
named to Soccer America's All-Freshman
team and National Soccer Coaches Associ
ation of America Far West Region All-
America. He finished the year ranked
sixth in the nation (second among fresh
men).
The following year would be no differ
ent. In 1008, Zapala surpassed the record
that he had tied a onlv the year before by
accumulating If) shutouts in one season.
Zapala's junior year in 1000 was just as
impressive as his first two seasons. Record
ing nine shutouts with a 0.88 CAA, Zapala
was one of only six players to start every
game, playing all but five minutes of the
entire season.
He was named both a NCSCAA Far
West Region All-American and Academic
All-American in addition to second team
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation All-
Federation.
I bis year, Zapala comes into the season
again as an Ail-American candidate and as
one of Stanford's tri-c aptains.
Despite his records and amazing num
bers, the fifth-year senior is much more to
the team than a stone wall in the goal.
"It's nice to have someone who has been
around and knows the team," Clark said.
"He knows everything that 1 have to say
.md he understands what the team should
be doing, so he really becomes an extra

coach [on the field].
"If you just listen to him, lie's talking the
whole game. He knows all of the positions
and knows where they should be. I le real
ly does a tremendous job."
So far this season "Coach" Zapala has
stepped right back in where he left off the
last three seasons. Considering he has al
ready accumulated an impressive eight
shutouts, (surrendering his one and only
goal in last week's 1-1 tie against No. 0 San
Jose State), his (IAA is at an impressive 0.12
with 21 saves recorded so far this season.
Even after two impressive shutouts this
weekend versus Seton Hall and Cincinnati
to add to the Cardinal's undefeated record,
Zapala understands that there is always
room for improvement, not only within the
team but also on a personal level.
"For me, 1 felt as though the weekend
went well," he said. "Anytime you put up
two zero's in a weekend you should be
pleased, but there are always little things
to work on. 1 think that I am my tough
est critic.
"1 think the real positive thing about
this side is that we all realize we have not
yet reached our potential. There is a huge
room for improvement in a lot of different
areas, [but] considering that we are not
playing our best soccer, there is room for
excitement. I lie most important thing for
us is to keep improving throughout the
year â€” we can't level oil.'
