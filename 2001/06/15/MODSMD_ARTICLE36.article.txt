# Seniors leave softball legacy
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
Two leaders, two seniors to be missed.
Of the 15 members of the Stanford soft
ball team that made the pilgrimage to ()k
-lahoma City this year to play in the
Women's College World Series, two se
niors appreciated it the most.
Jenni Shideler and Ramona Shelburne
arrived on the Farm when the Cardinal
softball program was still in its building
stages. There was a brand new field — now
the No. 3 team in the nation plays in a sta
dium. There was a second year coach,
John Kittman, who was declared Pacific 10
Conference Co-Coach of the Year this sea
son. And there was a Stanford team that
had never made it to postseason play —
this year's squad went to the World Series.
Shideler and Shelburne have been
through many changes in their four years
of collegiate play, as they have helped
build the program from its early stages to
its present status as a national force.
"The past four years, Ramona and 1
have been a part of a lot of firsts," Shideler
said. "The World Series was obviously the

biggest first, and it was amazing to set* the
hard work of so many people come to
gether and achieve their goal. It was so
special."
The achievements of the past four years
have reflec ted the time and effort Shideler
and Shelburne have dedicated — but the
team and the experience as members of
the softball squad are what have meant the
most.
"My teammates will be my friends for
ever," Shideler said. "Honestly, 1 don't
think there is another program in the
country with «»team as close as ours. That
also carries over in to the field; we have
great c hemistry.
Their teammates second the idea that
the relationships and personalities of the
team carry over on to the field.
"Ramona is a hard worker and will do
whatever it takes to help the team," s.iid ju
nior Robin Walker. "Whether it be laying
her body in front of the team or reading
over a fellow teammates paper.
The attitude that Shelburne brings to
the field and to life is noticed by many.
"She cares so much, and everyone on
the field can see and feel that." Shideler

said.
I his love for Softball makes Shelburne
give her all, she says.
"Lverv practice you go out and try to
get better; everv game takes you one step
c loser toward your goals," Shelburne said.
"When you have a picture in your mind of
what you love in life and what you're work
ing toward, especially one like going to the
World Series, it's not hard to motivate
yourself to work at it. to push yourself."
Shelburne has led her team with hard
work tor tour years, while Shideler brings
a competitive streak to the field that many
say is contagious.
"Jenni has played a huge role on-our
team," Walker said. "She has been so ver
satile all four years and a real leader. Jenni
leads with a quiet intensity."
Shideler's intensity landed her a start
ing position all four years at the l at in. In
her freshman campaign, she inunediateh
made an impact by being named Rookie of
the Year and starting at first base and fin
ishing the season with the highest fielding
percentage on the team.
No. 24 then moved to right field in her
second year, bringing height and consis

tency to the out field. Finally, she found her
resting place at third base, where she ag
gressively led her team for her last two sea
sons.
Shelburne has also brought versatility
to the ( Cardinal, as she has played all three
outfield positions in her time on the Farm
— three seas<>ns as an undergraduate, and
one while earning her master's degree.
Shelburne graduated from Stanford in
three vears with a ba< helot 'sin communi
cation and will finish her masters in com
munication this |une. I he starting right
fielder has earned numerous academic
awards, including being named an NFC'A
A1.1.-AmeiK.iu Scholai Athlete m 1998
and 1999 and an Academic All Pac-10
team member in 1999 and 2090. Shideler
joined Shelbui neon the Academic All I'ac
-10 team in 2000.
Hut these honors, while they may re
fled main of the hours Shelburne and
Shidelei have spent while at Stanford, will
not be what tliev remember the most.
"I will miss the moments," Shelburne
said. "1 ike when Sarah Beeson hit a borne
run against Louisiana State in our first
game at the W«>rld Series, oi when [Jessica

Mcndoza] hit me in from second for the
winning run in that game. Those mo
ments, when everything just comes to
gether perfectly, are like the greatest highs
iti the world."
And Shelburne and Shideler are no
strangers to being the center of those mo
ments. As Shelhurne recalls, she scored t he
winning run in the first game Stanford had
ever played in a College World Series. ()ne
of Shideler's spotlights came in the second
game of the series with (California this sea
son. The lead continued to be challenged
by both teams until Shideler settled the
battle with a towering home run over the
right-center field fence.
These moments of glory stretch beyond
softball. When asked what her favorite
thing about Stanford was, Shelburne
replied, "Stanford is a place that pushes
you to do your best, to think big."
Thinking big is what Shideler and Shel
burne have done in their four years at the
Farm, and what they have done tor the
program can only be described as huge.
