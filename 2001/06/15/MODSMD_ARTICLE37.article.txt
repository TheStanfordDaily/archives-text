# Seniors go for one more title
## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Over the past four years, fans have be
come accustomed to the consistent, siz
zling groundstrokes of Alex Kim and the
fiery passion that has come to characterize
the play of Scotty Scott and Ali Ansari.
After the postseason culminates with
the NCAA Championships in May, the
top-ranked Cardinal will bid adieu to the
three seniors, who all plan to dip their feet
into the A Tl' tour after graduation.
But, to all three, the future must be put
on the backburner for now.
"Since the NCAAs will be our last ath
letic event at Stanford, it would be the
high of all highs to go out as seniors by
winning the title," Ansari said. "We've
worked so hard this year, and we've got
ten so good as a whole. I'd love to go out
with a win."
Despite the three different personali
ties on the court, the seniors look to come
together for their third team title.
"I've learned a lot playing with these
guys. Scotty keeps me composed because
I get a little crazy at times," Ansari said.
"Alex and I are pretty much polar oppo
sites, because lit- is the rational one.'
Their sense of teamwork and respect
for each other has pulled the three to
gether in spite of their contrasting styles.
"I think the thing that I learned the

most has been the value of camaraderie,"
Scott said. "With [Ansari and Kim], it was
easy because they are great guys. It was
lots of fun, but, at the same time, educa
tional to learn from them because 1 ad
mire the way they handle themselves on
the court."
Although collegiate tennis is very team
oriented, this does not overshadow the in
dividual accomplishments of the seniors.
Kim, the Cardinal's No. 1 singles play
er for the past two years, achieved a 23-2
record this year and finished at the top of
the national rankings for singles. He also
teamed with junior K.J. Hippensteel to
finish 15th in the nation with a 14-5 dou
bles record. Kim is also the defending
NCAA Singles (Champion.
Scott, who played mostly at the No. 5
spot this year, came out of the regular sea
son with a 19-7 record. I le achieved a per
sonal high ranking of 43 in the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association Fall Singles
Rankings tins year. I le also won the match
that clinched the national team title for the
Cardinal last year.
Ansari played mostly at No. 5 or No. (>
all season and finished tied for the most
wins on the team .it 26-fi. He achieved a
career-best ranking of 83 in the lIA Fall
Singles Rankings this year. He also
reached the semifinals as the seventh seed
of the 1 I A Indoor Qualifying Regional
Tournament .it Berkeley last October.

Ansari and Scott have been doubles
partners since freshman year. This sea
son. playing at No. 2 or No. 3, they fin
ished at No. 41 and achieved a 24-7
record. The pair won the doubles title at
the Sherwood Collegiate Cup during the
fall season of this year.
"It's been fun [playing with Ali] because
he and I are really similar on the court,"
Scott said. "We both bring lots of energy.
It's been fun seeing how we've developed
and how we've learned played together. I
couldn't think of playing with anybody
else."
Ansari said he has appreciated the jour
ney that the two have shared.
"We've had our ups and downs," he
said. "We barely had a .500 record during
our sophomore year, and [head] coach
[Dick Could] wanted to take us apart in
our junior year, but we asked fora second
chance, and he gave it to us. We may not
have the biggest serves or strokes, but it is
our intensity, heart and our emotion that
carries us through the matches."
I he camaraderie of all three seniors
did not develop overnight.
Ansari, a native of Houston; Kim, from
Potomac, Md.; and Scott, hailing from
Belevdere, comprised the recruiting class
of 199 Hand began playing on a Stanford
team that was unstoppable.
This 1998 team, which finished 28-0,
featured players such as Mike and Bob

Hi van, I'.iul Coldstein, Ryan Wolters and
Ceoff Abrams. I lie team was so strong
that it went through the NCAA Champi
onships, blanking every single opponent
it tared.
"Kven though 1 wasn't a starter, it was
something t< > work tor," said Scott, the sev
enth player on the squad. "We saw how
the guys at the top level in college played
and trained and went about their mental
ity on the court. It was just fun to be part
of because I learned a lot from the guys
ahead of me."
However, Kim, who played No. (i sin
gles, said he believed that playing for such
an invincible team gave the young players
a false sense of what it takes to win the na
tional championship.
"I believe that [freshman year] hurt us
because we won every match so easily, and
we never really knew what college tennis
was really about," he said.
All three cited the same third-round
upset loss to Baylor during the following
year in the 1909 NCAA Team Champi
onship as the worst moment — and a
turning point — in their collegiate ca
reers.
"Ity junior year, I think all three of us
matured <1 lot. and we took on unspoken
leadership roles on the team," Ansari said.
"We rcallv knew what it felt like to lose,
and we did not want it to happen again."
In 2000, the three juniors took their

new roles seriously, and, along with senior
Geoff Abrams, led the team to a 2H-1 fin
ish and to Stanford's 17th NCAA Team
Championship.
The coaches and the rest of the team
say they will miss the leadership from the
three seniors.
"It was unbelievable coaching tliem be
cause it is players like them that make
coaching so satisfying," (lould said. "They
each have great heart, great talent and
they all give 100-percent effort every time.
We will miss their leadership greatly."
"[They] are valuable to the team be
cause they are great players, and their
records obviously speak for that," sopho
more Carter Morris said. "For that same
reason, they will be extremely hard to re
place next year."
"Hopefully, things go well, and, if not,
I would be perfectly satisfied with my ca
reer as a tennis player, and there's noth
ing 1 would ever forget," Ansari said.
Both Ansari, an economics major and
Scott, a communications major, said that
they would get MBA degrees and start
businesses il the professional tout does not
work out.
Whatever the case may be, these three
individuals will leave the Farm having left
a lasting legacy in Stanford tennis historv.

said. "We barely had a .500 record during
our sophomore year, and [head] coach
[Dick Could] wanted to take us apart in
our junior year, but we asked fora second
chance, and he gave it to us. We may not
have the biggest serves or strokes, but it is
our intensity, heart and our emotion that
carries us through the matches."
I he camaraderie of all three seniors
did not develop overnight.
Ansari, a native of Houston; Kim, from
Potomac, Md.; and Scott, hailing from
Belevdere, comprised the recruiting class
of 199 Hand began playing on a Stanford
team that was unstoppable.
This 1998 team, which finished 28-0,
featured players such as Mike and Bob

Hi van, I'.iul Coldstein, Ryan Wolters and
Ceoff Abrams. I lie team was so strong
that it went through the NCAA Champi
onships, blanking every single opponent
it tared.
"Kven though 1 wasn't a starter, it was
something t< > work tor," said Scott, the sev
enth player on the squad. "We saw how
the guys at the top level in college played
and trained and went about their mental
ity on the court. It was just fun to be part
of because I learned a lot from the guys
ahead of me."
However, Kim, who played No. (i sin
gles, said he believed that playing for such
an invincible team gave the young players
a false sense of what it takes to win the na
tional championship.
"I believe that [freshman year] hurt us
because we won every match so easily, and
we never really knew what college tennis
was really about," he said.
All three cited the same third-round
upset loss to Baylor during the following
year in the 1909 NCAA Team Champi
onship as the worst moment — and a
turning point — in their collegiate ca
reers.
"Ity junior year, I think all three of us
matured <1 lot. and we took on unspoken
leadership roles on the team," Ansari said.
"We rcallv knew what it felt like to lose,
and we did not want it to happen again."
In 2000, the three juniors took their

new roles seriously, and, along with senior
Geoff Abrams, led the team to a 2H-1 fin
ish and to Stanford's 17th NCAA Team
Championship.
The coaches and the rest of the team
say they will miss the leadership from the
three seniors.
"It was unbelievable coaching tliem be
cause it is players like them that make
coaching so satisfying," (lould said. "They
each have great heart, great talent and
they all give 100-percent effort every time.
We will miss their leadership greatly."
"[They] are valuable to the team be
cause they are great players, and their
records obviously speak for that," sopho
more Carter Morris said. "For that same
reason, they will be extremely hard to re
place next year."
"Hopefully, things go well, and, if not,
I would be perfectly satisfied with my ca
reer as a tennis player, and there's noth
ing 1 would ever forget," Ansari said.
Both Ansari, an economics major and
Scott, a communications major, said that
they would get MBA degrees and start
businesses il the professional tout does not
work out.
Whatever the case may be, these three
individuals will leave the Farm having left
a lasting legacy in Stanford tennis historv.

Over the past four years, fans have be
come accustomed to the consistent, siz
zling groundstrokes of Alex Kim and the
fiery passion that has come to characterize
the play of Scotty Scott and Ali Ansari.
After the postseason culminates with
the NCAA Championships in May, the
top-ranked Cardinal will bid adieu to the
three seniors, who all plan to dip their feet
into the A Tl' tour after graduation.
But, to all three, the future must be put
on the backburner for now.
"Since the NCAAs will be our last ath
letic event at Stanford, it would be the
high of all highs to go out as seniors by
winning the title," Ansari said. "We've
worked so hard this year, and we've got
ten so good as a whole. I'd love to go out
with a win."
Despite the three different personali
ties on the court, the seniors look to come
together for their third team title.
"I've learned a lot playing with these
guys. Scotty keeps me composed because
I get a little crazy at times," Ansari said.
"Alex and I are pretty much polar oppo
sites, because lit- is the rational one.'
Their sense of teamwork and respect
for each other has pulled the three to
gether in spite of their contrasting styles.
"I think the thing that I learned the

most has been the value of camaraderie,"
Scott said. "With [Ansari and Kim], it was
easy because they are great guys. It was
lots of fun, but, at the same time, educa
tional to learn from them because 1 ad
mire the way they handle themselves on
the court."
Although collegiate tennis is very team
oriented, this does not overshadow the in
dividual accomplishments of the seniors.
Kim, the Cardinal's No. 1 singles play
er for the past two years, achieved a 23-2
record this year and finished at the top of
the national rankings for singles. He also
teamed with junior K.J. Hippensteel to
finish 15th in the nation with a 14-5 dou
bles record. Kim is also the defending
NCAA Singles (Champion.
Scott, who played mostly at the No. 5
spot this year, came out of the regular sea
son with a 19-7 record. I le achieved a per
sonal high ranking of 43 in the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association Fall Singles
Rankings tins year. I le also won the match
that clinched the national team title for the
Cardinal last year.
Ansari played mostly at No. 5 or No. (>
all season and finished tied for the most
wins on the team .it 26-fi. He achieved a
career-best ranking of 83 in the lIA Fall
Singles Rankings this year. He also
reached the semifinals as the seventh seed
of the 1 I A Indoor Qualifying Regional
Tournament .it Berkeley last October.

Ansari and Scott have been doubles
partners since freshman year. This sea
son. playing at No. 2 or No. 3, they fin
ished at No. 41 and achieved a 24-7
record. The pair won the doubles title at
the Sherwood Collegiate Cup during the
fall season of this year.
"It's been fun [playing with Ali] because
he and I are really similar on the court,"
Scott said. "We both bring lots of energy.
It's been fun seeing how we've developed
and how we've learned played together. I
couldn't think of playing with anybody
else."
Ansari said he has appreciated the jour
ney that the two have shared.
