### KIMBERLY DOWNS EDITORIAL STAFF 
James Montoya, vice provost for student attains,
annouiueil yesterday that Ik- will Ik- leaving Stanford
on June 30 to take a newly created position as vice
president of the College Hoard.
"Believe me, the opportunity and challenge the
College Board have placed before me would have to
be extraordinary for me to leave my wonderful life ai
Stanford," he said. "Stanford students inspire me and
energize me; they provide me with such a sense of
hope for the future. It is now time for me to follow
their example and apply my 10-year Stanford experi
ence to a broader context."
"There is never a good time to leave Stanford, but
it does feel like the right time, and not just because the
last c lass I admitted to the I Hiversity is graduating
this June," Montoya said. "1 have been here lOvears.
We have a new president and provost who are com
mitted deeply to student affairs, and,we are blessed
with .m extraordinary student affairs staff."
Montoya's new position will not take him far from
Stanford, however. He will be based in San Jose and
will oversee activities and programs of the College
Board in the western half of the United States.
The College Board is a national nonprofit mem
bership association with major programs in college
admission, guidance, financial aid and enrollment,
including the SAT and PSA I /NMSQ'I testing pro
grams. Montoya served as a College Board trustee
from 1993 to 1995 and as faculty in the College
Board Summer Admission Institute.
"I'm depressed," said Vice Provost for Under
graduate liduc at ion John Bravman, who has worked
c losely with Montoya on many projects, of Montoya's
departure. "We've developed <i good working rela
tionship, and it has helped to strengthen the ties be
tween the [Vice Provost for Student Affairs] office
and the [Vice Provost's Office]."
"But I'm also delighted foi him, and I'm going to
work very hard to form as good of a partnership with
his successor. It means losing someone who is Mr.
Stanford, and I'll miss his wisdom and guidance,"
Bravman said.
"Jim is my idea of a vice provost for student affairs,"
said Provost John Ltchemendy. "His shoes will be
hard to fill. We are lucky to have had the benefit of his
talents for 10 years and wish him well in his exciting

new endeavor."
"1 know firsthand how deeply rooted the values of
access, equity and excellence are to the board's work
in connec ting students to education opportunities,"
Montoya said. " This is where I want to be in the next
phase of my career; I want to help lead the national
disc ussion on the use of standardized tests in the ad
mission process and participate in the development of
public policy related to education. I lie only major
drawback is that I have to leave Stanford to do so."
"We are honored that James Montoya will be join
ing the (ollege Board as vice president for the West,
Southwest and Midwest regions," Caston Caperton,
College Board president, s.iid on Monday. "Jim is
widelv regarded .is a real student c hampion. At Stan
ford and elsewhere, he lias been both honored and
beloved bv students.
"Because of liisexperience in college admissions, lie
has worked verv closeh with high schools in evei v part
of the country. I c an't think of anvone better prepared
than he is to advance the College Board's important
mission of preparing, inspiring and connecting stu
dents to c ollege and opportunity."
Montoya earned his bachelor's degree in Spanish
studies from Stanford in 197~> and 11is master's degree
in administration and polic \ analysis from the S< liool

Senior Camellia Rodrigue/.-Sackßvrne, who
worked with Montoya to plan .in upcoming diver
sity conference and is a stall member in his office,
said she's pleased that Montoya is moving into a
larger arena.
"It will be an amazing opportunity. 1 know, from
what lie's done .it Stanford, he can connect with so
manv student groups," she said. Montoya once passed
out stuffed animals and read "Coodniiiht Moon" to

students .u.i residence hall, she recalled. "Whether
lie's talking to lat ge groups, or on a one-to-one basis,
he connects." It's hard to imagine Stanford without
his"(ool-t at pei sonalitv" and bow tie, she said.
" I here are few people at Stanford who have been
,is committed to all of our students as has Jim Mon
toya," said Luis Fraga, a resident fellow in Castano and
associate professor of political science, who worked
with Montoya on a variety of campus issues. "He will
be sorely missed. 1 he I niversity will truly be lucky if it

create the (>raduate Student Life ()Hice.
"| im has paid attention to graduate students in a
way that hasn't happened at Stanford since the de
centralization of graduate studies in the early 19905.
I credit him and his staff for really attempting to up
grade the quality of life tor graduate students," said
George Dekker, associate dean for graduate policy.
"He's been wonderful in that regard."

spring quarter. As a Stanford alumnus, the campus
