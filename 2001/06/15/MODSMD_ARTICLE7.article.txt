# Hennessy faces challenges, celebrates completing first year
## 
### NINA CANN-WOODE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Around Campus, John Hennessy is the
University president, but, oil campus, lie
seems to be Stanford itself.
"I see him as an overall guide to the
health of the University," said Mark Made
ly, Class of 1989, who was among the 150
people who heard 1 lennessy speak during a
Houston, Texas, stop on his 10-city wel
come tour.
That Hennessy represents such a large
part of Stanford to so many people cotrelates
to the amount of'responsibility' lie carries. In
recent times, a few prominent issues have
tested the strength and integrity of his lead
ership.
Acts of intolerance
On the morning of March 20. white su
premacist and anti-Asian messages were dis
covered scrawled with black marker on the
wall of two classrcxims in the Lane History
(lorner and a classroom in Building 50. The
racist graffiti marked the launch of an issue
th.it would spark campuswide student
protest, administrative response and count
less dialogue.
Much of that dialogue was focused on
Hennessy's role in addressing the issue of
racist graffiti.
"It [has become evident] just how quiet
Hennessy has been as president of the I ni
versity," said an April 25 Daily editorial.
"()ne would think that a crime as offensive
and harmful as hate graffiti would clicit a
powerful response from the University, es
pecially the president. But rather than im
mediately releasing a statement that strong
ly condemned such acts of hate and racism,
Hennessy spoke briefly and then let lower
administrators handle the rest... By ne
glecting to take a hard-line approach to
these hate crimes, Hennessy failed main
members of the Stanford community."
Not so, said I lennessy.
"The [racist graffiti] issue was kept low
profile because it seems as though we are
dealing with a single individual, and, thus,
[we] didn't want to give that individual the
attention [he or she] desired," he said.
"Being president, you have to make calls
that [will not Ik* supported by] everyone in
the University community."
Senior Seiji Yamainoto said he shared
this view.
"Being the president of a university is a
difficult job because of the unrealistic expec
tations many people may have," he said.
"It's easy to forget about John Hennessy the
human being and only focus on the duties of
his office. It's true that he has the most
power of any one individual to effect
change, but the power we entmsted him
was not a deification.
"To be honest, I don't think he's had
enough time to really prove himself, so I'd
[prefer] to postpone judgment fora while.
Now, we currently face a number of prob
lems, though in my view they are not attrib
utable to either [former University Presi

dent Gerhard] Casper or Hennessv, l>iit
merely an unfortunate conscience of fac
tors."
(Xher students s.iid thev disagreed.
"Though President Hennessv might
have done some ama/ing things this year,
the one event th.it has tainted [my opinion
of him] is his p<>or reaction to the hate crimes
on campus," said one sophomore. "I Ixlieve
that, at any other university, the president
would have reallv had .1 strong reaction to
such hate crimes and would have taken ac
tion immediately.
"Instead, Hennessv delegated the re
sponsibility to deal with the hate crimes to
lower administrators and seemed quite re
luctant to aggressively combat su< h rat ism.
It makes me sad that the administration
does not feel that the safety of students of
color is a top priority here."
"Downsizing" of the humanities?
Other issues have warranted adminis
trative response this year. I he proposed
merger of six departments — Asian Lan
guages, Comparative Literature, German
Studies, Slavic languages and Literatures
and Spanish & Portuguese — into the l>e

partment of languages, (Cultures and Lit
eratures led manv frustrated students to
protest the University and Hennessv's
"downsizing" of the humanities.
Rush Rehm, .in asstyiate professor of
drama and classics, tol(f the Stanford Re|x>rt
the propositi was intellectually "vacuous"
and th.it terms in the proposed plan, like
"strength" and "flexibility," were l>eing used
for cover.
" There's flexibility in this university all
over the place," Rehm said. "There's noth
ing stopping faculty at this university from
getting together and doing things they
want. Do we really need to throw a lot of
people together that don't want to Ik* to
gether in order to develop flexibility?"
In addition to the issue of departmental
ization, said other faculty members, is con
tern for recruitment in general.
"We have seen our numbers shrink over
the List several years, with departing fat ui
ty members not always being replaced,"
Classics Prof. Joshua I finely said. "The
longer key positions remain unfilled, the
worse our situation, since we risk entering
,i vicious circle; small numbers of faculty
translates to a stn.ill pool of department

graduates, which in turn makes it hard to
justify the recruitment of new faculty.
What President Hennessy could do at this
point, in my view, is simply to make funds
available for the recruitment of top schol
ars— independently of the [proposed de
partment merger]."
Hennessy said he has made a promise
not to reduce the commitment to the hu
manities, in keeping with Casper's success
es in that area, and that accusations to the
contrary are untrue. Three hundred mil
lion of the recent $400 million Hewlett
Foundation gift will go toward funding for
the School of Humanities and Sciences,
which has identified needs totaling mote
ih.in $ I billion.
"The present structure of things would
not have contributed to the structure and
success of [the language departments],"
I lennessy said. "The whole goal of the pro
posed merger is to strengthen and put more
resources into the humanities, not to [con
found] its identity."
Provost John Etchemendy said he
agreed, calling the negative charges leveled
at I lennessy "unfair in the extreme."
"The proposal to merge the language de
partments was actually my decision, and
John approved it," Etchemendy said. 'The
dec ision was made not because of budget
reasons. Ihe cheapest thing we can do is to
leave things they way they are now."
According to Elizabeth Bernhardt, direc
tor of the language Center and a German
studies professor, the proposed department
merger would allow fora greater, not small
er, diversity of curricula.
"At present, smaller languages at Stan
ford have no academic: home other than in
the Special Languages Program," said
Bernhardt, who supports the mergct initia
tive. 'T his means that, under the present
structure, we can never make an academic
counc il appointment in Hebrew or Arabic
or Swahili. I his puts us in a vulnerable posi
tion vis ,i vis graduate student interest."
"But, more importantly, this configura
tion is simply wrong. There is substantial in
terest around campus in the Middle East
and Africa. The literatures and cultures of
these areas are critical and yet there is no
way fora Stanford student to explore these
literatures and cultures with specialists in
the area."
Ihough some faculty, staff and students
said they were dissatisfied with the prop< >sed
merger itself, many assented to
Etchemendy's plan to appoint a committee
to study it.
"I wekome hovost Etchemendy's decision
to convene a Blue Ribbon Committee," said
Jeffrey Schnapp, chair of the Department of
French and Italian, who opposes the merg
er plan. "'Hie current proposal was not only
flawed as regards process, but also, and
more ini|x>rtantly, failed to take advantage
of what, in reality, was an enormous oppor
tunity to think boldly and imaginatively
about possible futures for the literary disci
plines at Stanford."

Commencement speaker choices
Hennessy's selection of (larlv Fiorina,
president and chief executive officer of
Hewlett-Packard, as this year's Com
mencement speaker also drew criticism
from students. Perhaps fueled by
Hewlett-Packard's corporate ties or, [as
some said], because I iorina was not "in
spirational" or "famous" enough, the de
bate raged on.
"I think that Carl\ Fiorina was chosen be
cause of the University's ties to [Hewlett-
Packard] and the need to maintain their do
nations despite I lewletts recent death," se
nioi Krista (.laser said. "What better way to
keep HP happy with our University? The
Commencement speaker is a great prize,
and Stanford gave it to them."
Hennessy said he agreed that there
should have been more communication
between the administration and Senior
( lass presidents about the selection
process, but maintained that it is more
c hallenging than most people expect.
Some students, when asked, said they
would prefer it if 1 lennessv communicated
more with the student body in general.
I lc needs to have a greater presence in
the community." said one sophomore. "He
should be going to student group meetings,
talking at dining halls and really interacting
with the people here.
"A lot of people generally have no idea
of what I lennessv is np to, and, while that
might be the workings of a humble man,
it is also realh annoying because no one
ever has an\ idea of what administrative
changes will be made until they are about
to be implemented."
In response to criticism of Fiorina's
Hewlett-Packard connection, Hennessy
cited her background in the humanities.
Fiorina majored in Medieval history and
philosophy .it Stanford.
I sought, on your behalf and on behalf
of the graduate students with whom you
share this ceremony, a Commencement
speaker whose accomplishments, contri
butions and ability to influence the world
gave him or her a distinctive point of view
from which to offer advice about issues of
consequence, Hennessy wrote in an e
inail to the Senior ( lass. "As has been tra
dition. we gave priority to speakers with a
Stanford connection."
"We have a worlds lass Commencement
speaker. 1 lennessv continued.
"She is considered the most powerful
and influential woman in the business
today, and the technology revolution she
helps drive will influence your generation
and those of your children and grandchil
dren in ways we can only imagine."
Medical Center finances
Hie issue of financial losses in the Med
ic .11 (-enter has also confronted I lennessv in
his first year. I lie 11)97 Balanced Budged
Act has had significant consequences for
academic medical centers across the nation.


Stanford News Service
President John Hennessy has faced a number of difficult issues in his first year, including racist
graffiti, controversy over Commencement speaker Carly Fiorina and the continued loss of rev
enue by the Medical Center.
According to Philip Piz/o, the newly
appointed clean of the School ol
Medicine, financial problems at
Stanford I fospitals and (llinic s have
been particularlv significant follow
ing the unsuccessful merger then
de-merger of Stanford with I'(1-San
Francisco, which officially terminat
ed a year ago.

"During the past months, [Stan
ford Hospitals and C.linics] has
been working diligently to reduce
these financial losses," Pizzo said.
"Because he has recognized the
importance of the relationship of
[hospitals and clinics], as well as the
Luc ille Packard ( children's Hospi
tal, to the School of Mcdic ine, Pres
ident Hennessy lias assumed an
important leadership role. He has
recognized the problems facing
academic medical (enters are pre
dominantly related to tlic fact that

payment for clinical services, by
HMOs, insurance companies and
state and federal programs, are
below their actual cost.
"| I lennessy's] leadership also ex
tends to entrusting the leaders of the
Medical Center to work more suc
cessfully on behalf of the future <>112
the Stanford University School of
Medicine because of its importance
to the future <>t < hildren and adults
.ind Ixrause oi the important and
integral role it plays in the Universi
ty," Pizzo said.

Looking forward
Pizzo is one of several professors
to receive deanships in the past
year under I fennessy, a fact he said
is significant because it highlights
the relative youth of I lennessy's
administration.
"The ( hanging landscape of
Stanford itself, both physical and
organizational, reflects the con
stantly evolving nature of the times.
Concerns, complaints and compli
ments notwithstanding, Hen
nessv's administration is still in its

early stages."
In offering his opinion of what
Stanford embodies, I lennessy drew
upon the Founders' goals and oth
ers that came before him.
"David Starr Jordan, speaking
from the West Portal of the Quad
on that opening day 109 years ago,
made this point with eloquence and
simplicity: 'Our university is hal
lowed by no traditions,' " Hennessy
said during his inauguration
speech Oct. 20, 2000. " 'It is ham
pered by none. It's finger posts all

point forward.' "
"Happily, in the intervening
years, we have developed many
wonderful traditions," Hennessy
said, "but 1 am sure you believe, as I
do, that we are still hampered by
none.
"()ur challenges are many, but
our potential is unlxninded, and
our linger p< >sts all continue to point
forward."

want. Do we really need to throw a lot of
people together that don't want to Ik* to
gether in order to develop flexibility?"
In addition to the issue of departmental
ization, said other faculty members, is con
tern for recruitment in general.
"We have seen our numbers shrink over
the List several years, with departing fat ui
ty members not always being replaced,"
Classics Prof. Joshua I finely said. "The
longer key positions remain unfilled, the
worse our situation, since we risk entering
,i vicious circle; small numbers of faculty
translates to a stn.ill pool of department

graduates, which in turn makes it hard to
justify the recruitment of new faculty.
What President Hennessy could do at this
point, in my view, is simply to make funds
available for the recruitment of top schol
ars— independently of the [proposed de
partment merger]."
Hennessy said he has made a promise
not to reduce the commitment to the hu
manities, in keeping with Casper's success
es in that area, and that accusations to the
contrary are untrue. Three hundred mil
lion of the recent $400 million Hewlett
Foundation gift will go toward funding for
the School of Humanities and Sciences,
which has identified needs totaling mote
ih.in $ I billion.
"The present structure of things would
not have contributed to the structure and
success of [the language departments],"
I lennessy said. "The whole goal of the pro
posed merger is to strengthen and put more
resources into the humanities, not to [con
found] its identity."
Provost John Etchemendy said he
agreed, calling the negative charges leveled
at I lennessy "unfair in the extreme."
"The proposal to merge the language de
partments was actually my decision, and
John approved it," Etchemendy said. 'The
dec ision was made not because of budget
reasons. Ihe cheapest thing we can do is to
leave things they way they are now."
According to Elizabeth Bernhardt, direc
tor of the language Center and a German
studies professor, the proposed department
merger would allow fora greater, not small
er, diversity of curricula.
"At present, smaller languages at Stan
ford have no academic: home other than in
the Special Languages Program," said
Bernhardt, who supports the mergct initia
tive. 'T his means that, under the present
structure, we can never make an academic
counc il appointment in Hebrew or Arabic
or Swahili. I his puts us in a vulnerable posi
tion vis ,i vis graduate student interest."
"But, more importantly, this configura
tion is simply wrong. There is substantial in
terest around campus in the Middle East
and Africa. The literatures and cultures of
these areas are critical and yet there is no
way fora Stanford student to explore these
literatures and cultures with specialists in
the area."
Ihough some faculty, staff and students
said they were dissatisfied with the prop< >sed
merger itself, many assented to
Etchemendy's plan to appoint a committee
to study it.
"I wekome hovost Etchemendy's decision
to convene a Blue Ribbon Committee," said
Jeffrey Schnapp, chair of the Department of
French and Italian, who opposes the merg
er plan. "'Hie current proposal was not only
flawed as regards process, but also, and
more ini|x>rtantly, failed to take advantage
of what, in reality, was an enormous oppor
tunity to think boldly and imaginatively
about possible futures for the literary disci
plines at Stanford."

Commencement speaker choices
Hennessy's selection of (larlv Fiorina,
president and chief executive officer of
Hewlett-Packard, as this year's Com
mencement speaker also drew criticism
from students. Perhaps fueled by
Hewlett-Packard's corporate ties or, [as
some said], because I iorina was not "in
spirational" or "famous" enough, the de
bate raged on.
"I think that Carl\ Fiorina was chosen be
cause of the University's ties to [Hewlett-
Packard] and the need to maintain their do
nations despite I lewletts recent death," se
nioi Krista (.laser said. "What better way to
keep HP happy with our University? The
Commencement speaker is a great prize,
and Stanford gave it to them."
Hennessy said he agreed that there
should have been more communication
between the administration and Senior
( lass presidents about the selection
process, but maintained that it is more
c hallenging than most people expect.
Some students, when asked, said they
would prefer it if 1 lennessv communicated
more with the student body in general.
I lc needs to have a greater presence in
the community." said one sophomore. "He
should be going to student group meetings,
talking at dining halls and really interacting
with the people here.
"A lot of people generally have no idea
of what I lennessv is np to, and, while that
might be the workings of a humble man,
it is also realh annoying because no one
ever has an\ idea of what administrative
changes will be made until they are about
to be implemented."
In response to criticism of Fiorina's
Hewlett-Packard connection, Hennessy
cited her background in the humanities.
Fiorina majored in Medieval history and
philosophy .it Stanford.
I sought, on your behalf and on behalf
of the graduate students with whom you
share this ceremony, a Commencement
speaker whose accomplishments, contri
butions and ability to influence the world
gave him or her a distinctive point of view
from which to offer advice about issues of
consequence, Hennessy wrote in an e
inail to the Senior ( lass. "As has been tra
dition. we gave priority to speakers with a
Stanford connection."
"We have a worlds lass Commencement
speaker. 1 lennessv continued.
"She is considered the most powerful
and influential woman in the business
today, and the technology revolution she
helps drive will influence your generation
and those of your children and grandchil
dren in ways we can only imagine."
Medical Center finances
Hie issue of financial losses in the Med
ic .11 (-enter has also confronted I lennessv in
his first year. I lie 11)97 Balanced Budged
Act has had significant consequences for
academic medical centers across the nation.


Stanford News Service
President John Hennessy has faced a number of difficult issues in his first year, including racist
graffiti, controversy over Commencement speaker Carly Fiorina and the continued loss of rev
enue by the Medical Center.
According to Philip Piz/o, the newly
appointed clean of the School ol
Medicine, financial problems at
Stanford I fospitals and (llinic s have
been particularlv significant follow
ing the unsuccessful merger then
de-merger of Stanford with I'(1-San
Francisco, which officially terminat
ed a year ago.

"During the past months, [Stan
ford Hospitals and C.linics] has
been working diligently to reduce
these financial losses," Pizzo said.
"Because he has recognized the
importance of the relationship of
[hospitals and clinics], as well as the
Luc ille Packard ( children's Hospi
tal, to the School of Mcdic ine, Pres
ident Hennessy lias assumed an
important leadership role. He has
recognized the problems facing
academic medical (enters are pre
dominantly related to tlic fact that

payment for clinical services, by
HMOs, insurance companies and
state and federal programs, are
below their actual cost.
"| I lennessy's] leadership also ex
tends to entrusting the leaders of the
Medical Center to work more suc
cessfully on behalf of the future <>112
the Stanford University School of
Medicine because of its importance
to the future <>t < hildren and adults
.ind Ixrause oi the important and
integral role it plays in the Universi
ty," Pizzo said.

Looking forward
Pizzo is one of several professors
to receive deanships in the past
year under I fennessy, a fact he said
is significant because it highlights
the relative youth of I lennessy's
administration.
"The ( hanging landscape of
Stanford itself, both physical and
organizational, reflects the con
stantly evolving nature of the times.
Concerns, complaints and compli
ments notwithstanding, Hen
nessv's administration is still in its

early stages."
In offering his opinion of what
Stanford embodies, I lennessy drew
upon the Founders' goals and oth
ers that came before him.
"David Starr Jordan, speaking
from the West Portal of the Quad
on that opening day 109 years ago,
made this point with eloquence and
simplicity: 'Our university is hal
lowed by no traditions,' " Hennessy
said during his inauguration
speech Oct. 20, 2000. " 'It is ham
pered by none. It's finger posts all

point forward.' "
"Happily, in the intervening
years, we have developed many
wonderful traditions," Hennessy
said, "but 1 am sure you believe, as I
do, that we are still hampered by
none.
"()ur challenges are many, but
our potential is unlxninded, and
our linger p< >sts all continue to point
forward."

Around Campus, John Hennessy is the
University president, but, oil campus, lie
seems to be Stanford itself.
"I see him as an overall guide to the
health of the University," said Mark Made
ly, Class of 1989, who was among the 150
people who heard 1 lennessy speak during a
Houston, Texas, stop on his 10-city wel
come tour.
That Hennessy represents such a large
part of Stanford to so many people cotrelates
to the amount of'responsibility' lie carries. In
recent times, a few prominent issues have
tested the strength and integrity of his lead
ership.
Acts of intolerance
On the morning of March 20. white su
premacist and anti-Asian messages were dis
covered scrawled with black marker on the
wall of two classrcxims in the Lane History
(lorner and a classroom in Building 50. The
racist graffiti marked the launch of an issue
th.it would spark campuswide student
protest, administrative response and count
less dialogue.
Much of that dialogue was focused on
Hennessy's role in addressing the issue of
racist graffiti.
"It [has become evident] just how quiet
Hennessy has been as president of the I ni
versity," said an April 25 Daily editorial.
"()ne would think that a crime as offensive
and harmful as hate graffiti would clicit a
powerful response from the University, es
pecially the president. But rather than im
mediately releasing a statement that strong
ly condemned such acts of hate and racism,
Hennessy spoke briefly and then let lower
administrators handle the rest... By ne
glecting to take a hard-line approach to
these hate crimes, Hennessy failed main
members of the Stanford community."
Not so, said I lennessy.
"The [racist graffiti] issue was kept low
profile because it seems as though we are
dealing with a single individual, and, thus,
[we] didn't want to give that individual the
attention [he or she] desired," he said.
"Being president, you have to make calls
that [will not Ik* supported by] everyone in
the University community."
Senior Seiji Yamainoto said he shared
this view.
"Being the president of a university is a
difficult job because of the unrealistic expec
tations many people may have," he said.
"It's easy to forget about John Hennessy the
human being and only focus on the duties of
his office. It's true that he has the most
power of any one individual to effect
change, but the power we entmsted him
was not a deification.
"To be honest, I don't think he's had
enough time to really prove himself, so I'd
[prefer] to postpone judgment fora while.
Now, we currently face a number of prob
lems, though in my view they are not attrib
utable to either [former University Presi

dent Gerhard] Casper or Hennessv, l>iit
merely an unfortunate conscience of fac
tors."
(Xher students s.iid thev disagreed.
"Though President Hennessv might
have done some ama/ing things this year,
the one event th.it has tainted [my opinion
of him] is his p<>or reaction to the hate crimes
on campus," said one sophomore. "I Ixlieve
that, at any other university, the president
would have reallv had .1 strong reaction to
such hate crimes and would have taken ac
tion immediately.
"Instead, Hennessv delegated the re
sponsibility to deal with the hate crimes to
lower administrators and seemed quite re
luctant to aggressively combat su< h rat ism.
It makes me sad that the administration
does not feel that the safety of students of
color is a top priority here."
"Downsizing" of the humanities?
Other issues have warranted adminis
trative response this year. I he proposed
merger of six departments — Asian Lan
guages, Comparative Literature, German
Studies, Slavic languages and Literatures
and Spanish & Portuguese — into the l>e

partment of languages, (Cultures and Lit
eratures led manv frustrated students to
protest the University and Hennessv's
"downsizing" of the humanities.
Rush Rehm, .in asstyiate professor of
drama and classics, tol(f the Stanford Re|x>rt
the propositi was intellectually "vacuous"
and th.it terms in the proposed plan, like
"strength" and "flexibility," were l>eing used
for cover.
" There's flexibility in this university all
over the place," Rehm said. "There's noth
ing stopping faculty at this university from
getting together and doing things they
want. Do we really need to throw a lot of
people together that don't want to Ik* to
gether in order to develop flexibility?"
In addition to the issue of departmental

In response to criticism of Fiorina's

cited her background in the humanities.
Fiorina majored in Medieval history and

Medical Center finances
Hie issue of financial losses in the Med
ic .11 (-enter has also confronted I lennessv in
his first year. I lie 11)97 Balanced Budged
Act has had significant consequences for
academic medical centers across the nation.


Stanford News Service
President John Hennessy has faced a number of difficult issues in his first year, including racist
graffiti, controversy over Commencement speaker Carly Fiorina and the continued loss of rev
enue by the Medical Center.
According to Philip Piz/o, the newly
appointed clean of the School ol
Medicine, financial problems at
Stanford I fospitals and (llinic s have
been particularlv significant follow
ing the unsuccessful merger then
de-merger of Stanford with I'(1-San
Francisco, which officially terminat
ed a year ago.

"During the past months, [Stan
ford Hospitals and C.linics] has
been working diligently to reduce
these financial losses," Pizzo said.
"Because he has recognized the
importance of the relationship of
[hospitals and clinics], as well as the
Luc ille Packard ( children's Hospi
tal, to the School of Mcdic ine, Pres
ident Hennessy lias assumed an
important leadership role. He has
recognized the problems facing
academic medical (enters are pre
dominantly related to tlic fact that

payment for clinical services, by
HMOs, insurance companies and
state and federal programs, are
below their actual cost.
"| I lennessy's] leadership also ex
tends to entrusting the leaders of the
Medical Center to work more suc
cessfully on behalf of the future <>112
the Stanford University School of
Medicine because of its importance
to the future <>t < hildren and adults
.ind Ixrause oi the important and
integral role it plays in the Universi
ty," Pizzo said.

Looking forward
Pizzo is one of several professors
to receive deanships in the past
year under I fennessy, a fact he said
is significant because it highlights
the relative youth of I lennessy's
administration.
"The ( hanging landscape of
Stanford itself, both physical and
organizational, reflects the con
stantly evolving nature of the times.
Concerns, complaints and compli
ments notwithstanding, Hen
nessv's administration is still in its

early stages."
In offering his opinion of what
Stanford embodies, I lennessy drew
upon the Founders' goals and oth
ers that came before him.
"David Starr Jordan, speaking
from the West Portal of the Quad
on that opening day 109 years ago,
made this point with eloquence and
simplicity: 'Our university is hal
lowed by no traditions,' " Hennessy
said during his inauguration
speech Oct. 20, 2000. " 'It is ham
pered by none. It's finger posts all

point forward.' "
"Happily, in the intervening
years, we have developed many
wonderful traditions," Hennessy
said, "but 1 am sure you believe, as I
do, that we are still hampered by
none.
"()ur challenges are many, but
our potential is unlxninded, and
our linger p< >sts all continue to point
forward."

Around Campus, John Hennessy is the
University president, but, oil campus, lie
seems to be Stanford itself.
"I see him as an overall guide to the
health of the University," said Mark Made
ly, Class of 1989, who was among the 150
people who heard 1 lennessy speak during a
Houston, Texas, stop on his 10-city wel
come tour.
That Hennessy represents such a large
part of Stanford to so many people cotrelates
to the amount of'responsibility' lie carries. In
recent times, a few prominent issues have
tested the strength and integrity of his lead
ership.
Acts of intolerance
On the morning of March 20. white su
premacist and anti-Asian messages were dis
covered scrawled with black marker on the
wall of two classrcxims in the Lane History
(lorner and a classroom in Building 50. The
racist graffiti marked the launch of an issue
th.it would spark campuswide student
protest, administrative response and count
less dialogue.
Much of that dialogue was focused on
Hennessy's role in addressing the issue of
racist graffiti.
"It [has become evident] just how quiet
Hennessy has been as president of the I ni
versity," said an April 25 Daily editorial.
"()ne would think that a crime as offensive
and harmful as hate graffiti would clicit a
powerful response from the University, es
pecially the president. But rather than im
mediately releasing a statement that strong
ly condemned such acts of hate and racism,
Hennessy spoke briefly and then let lower
administrators handle the rest... By ne
glecting to take a hard-line approach to
these hate crimes, Hennessy failed main
members of the Stanford community."
Not so, said I lennessy.
"The [racist graffiti] issue was kept low
profile because it seems as though we are
dealing with a single individual, and, thus,
[we] didn't want to give that individual the
attention [he or she] desired," he said.
"Being president, you have to make calls
that [will not Ik* supported by] everyone in
the University community."
Senior Seiji Yamainoto said he shared
this view.
"Being the president of a university is a
difficult job because of the unrealistic expec
tations many people may have," he said.
"It's easy to forget about John Hennessy the
human being and only focus on the duties of
his office. It's true that he has the most
power of any one individual to effect
change, but the power we entmsted him
was not a deification.
"To be honest, I don't think he's had
enough time to really prove himself, so I'd
[prefer] to postpone judgment fora while.
Now, we currently face a number of prob
lems, though in my view they are not attrib
utable to either [former University Presi

dent Gerhard] Casper or Hennessv, l>iit
merely an unfortunate conscience of fac
tors."
(Xher students s.iid thev disagreed.
"Though President Hennessv might
have done some ama/ing things this year,
the one event th.it has tainted [my opinion
of him] is his p<>or reaction to the hate crimes
on campus," said one sophomore. "I Ixlieve
that, at any other university, the president
would have reallv had .1 strong reaction to
such hate crimes and would have taken ac
tion immediately.
"Instead, Hennessv delegated the re
sponsibility to deal with the hate crimes to
lower administrators and seemed quite re
luctant to aggressively combat su< h rat ism.
It makes me sad that the administration
does not feel that the safety of students of
color is a top priority here."
"Downsizing" of the humanities?
Other issues have warranted adminis
trative response this year. I he proposed
merger of six departments — Asian Lan
guages, Comparative Literature, German
Studies, Slavic languages and Literatures
and Spanish & Portuguese — into the l>e

partment of languages, (Cultures and Lit
eratures led manv frustrated students to
protest the University and Hennessv's
"downsizing" of the humanities.
Rush Rehm, .in asstyiate professor of
drama and classics, tol(f the Stanford Re|x>rt
the propositi was intellectually "vacuous"
and th.it terms in the proposed plan, like
"strength" and "flexibility," were l>eing used
for cover.
" There's flexibility in this university all
over the place," Rehm said. "There's noth
ing stopping faculty at this university from
getting together and doing things they
want. Do we really need to throw a lot of
people together that don't want to Ik* to
gether in order to develop flexibility?"
In addition to the issue of departmental
ization, said other faculty members, is con
tern for recruitment in general.
"We have seen our numbers shrink over
the List several years, with departing fat ui
ty members not always being replaced,"
Classics Prof. Joshua I finely said. "The
longer key positions remain unfilled, the
worse our situation, since we risk entering
,i vicious circle; small numbers of faculty
translates to a stn.ill pool of department

graduates, which in turn makes it hard to
justify the recruitment of new faculty.
What President Hennessy could do at this
point, in my view, is simply to make funds
available for the recruitment of top schol
ars— independently of the [proposed de
partment merger]."
Hennessy said he has made a promise
not to reduce the commitment to the hu
manities, in keeping with Casper's success
es in that area, and that accusations to the
contrary are untrue. Three hundred mil
lion of the recent $400 million Hewlett
Foundation gift will go toward funding for
the School of Humanities and Sciences,
which has identified needs totaling mote
ih.in $ I billion.
"The present structure of things would
not have contributed to the structure and
success of [the language departments],"
I lennessy said. "The whole goal of the pro
posed merger is to strengthen and put more
resources into the humanities, not to [con
found] its identity."
Provost John Etchemendy said he
agreed, calling the negative charges leveled
at I lennessy "unfair in the extreme."
"The proposal to merge the language de
partments was actually my decision, and
John approved it," Etchemendy said. 'The
dec ision was made not because of budget
reasons. Ihe cheapest thing we can do is to
leave things they way they are now."
According to Elizabeth Bernhardt, direc
tor of the language Center and a German
studies professor, the proposed department
merger would allow fora greater, not small
er, diversity of curricula.
"At present, smaller languages at Stan
ford have no academic: home other than in
the Special Languages Program," said
Bernhardt, who supports the mergct initia
tive. 'T his means that, under the present
structure, we can never make an academic
counc il appointment in Hebrew or Arabic
or Swahili. I his puts us in a vulnerable posi
tion vis ,i vis graduate student interest."
"But, more importantly, this configura
tion is simply wrong. There is substantial in
terest around campus in the Middle East
and Africa. The literatures and cultures of
these areas are critical and yet there is no
way fora Stanford student to explore these
literatures and cultures with specialists in
the area."
Ihough some faculty, staff and students
said they were dissatisfied with the prop< >sed
merger itself, many assented to
Etchemendy's plan to appoint a committee
to study it.
"I wekome hovost Etchemendy's decision
to convene a Blue Ribbon Committee," said
Jeffrey Schnapp, chair of the Department of
French and Italian, who opposes the merg
er plan. "'Hie current proposal was not only
flawed as regards process, but also, and
more ini|x>rtantly, failed to take advantage
of what, in reality, was an enormous oppor
tunity to think boldly and imaginatively
about possible futures for the literary disci
plines at Stanford."

Commencement speaker choices
Hennessy's selection of (larlv Fiorina,
president and chief executive officer of
Hewlett-Packard, as this year's Com
mencement speaker also drew criticism
from students. Perhaps fueled by
Hewlett-Packard's corporate ties or, [as
some said], because I iorina was not "in
spirational" or "famous" enough, the de
bate raged on.
"I think that Carl\ Fiorina was chosen be
cause of the University's ties to [Hewlett-
Packard] and the need to maintain their do
nations despite I lewletts recent death," se
nioi Krista (.laser said. "What better way to
keep HP happy with our University? The
Commencement speaker is a great prize,
and Stanford gave it to them."
Hennessy said he agreed that there
should have been more communication
between the administration and Senior
( lass presidents about the selection
process, but maintained that it is more
c hallenging than most people expect.
Some students, when asked, said they
would prefer it if 1 lennessv communicated
more with the student body in general.
I lc needs to have a greater presence in
the community." said one sophomore. "He
should be going to student group meetings,
talking at dining halls and really interacting
with the people here.
"A lot of people generally have no idea
of what I lennessv is np to, and, while that
might be the workings of a humble man,
it is also realh annoying because no one

In response to criticism of Fiorina's
Hewlett-Packard connection, Hennessy
cited her background in the humanities.
Fiorina majored in Medieval history and
