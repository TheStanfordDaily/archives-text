### NADIRA HIRA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Hie William and Flora Hewlett Founda
tion will make a gift of $400 million in unre
stricted funds to Stanford, Hewlett Founda
tion Chairman Walter B. Hewlett an
nounced yesterday at noon in the Quad.
$800 million of the donation will be directed
to the S< hool of Humanities and Sciences,
and the remainder is earmarked for the
(Campaign for Undergraduate Education.
According to Provost John Etchemendy,
this is one of the largest gifts ever given to an in
stitution of higher education and the largest
gift to an endowment, to the knowledge of
University officials.
Some 250 faculty, staff and students,
who were invited via e-mail to witness the
"unprecedented historical announce
ment,'' were on hand this afternoon to
hear Walter Hewlett, Hewlett Foundation
President Paul Brest, University President
John Hennessy, Etchemendy and other
University officials announce and com
ment on the donation.
"This gift is a tribute to my father," Wal
ter Hewlett said, referring to the late
William Hewlett, who established the
Hewlett Foundation. "It honors his life
time of philanthropy, his lifelong devotion
to Stanford and his passionate belief in the
value of a liberal arts education. Had he
lived, I am certain this is something he
would have done himself."
The donation
The Hewlett Foundation's gift to Stan
ford is the largest gift ever to one Ameri
can university and may be the largest in
the world, Scott Jaschik, editor of the
Chronicle of Higher Education, told the
Associated Press yesterday. A $360 million
donation to Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti
tute in Troy, N.Y., was the previous
record.
This donation is 20 times larger than
any other gilt given by the Hewlett Foun
dation. The unrestricted nature of the do
nation allows the University to utilize the

funds where they are needed.
Hewlett Foundation Director James C.
(iaither called the donation a "bold vision
ary step."
"We hope, too, that this gift will en
courage others in the philanthropic world
— individuals as well as foundations — to
think boldly about making major commit
ments to the universities and other institu
tions that are important to our future,"
Caither said.
According to Etchemendy, the Univer
sity aims to get matching donations for this
gift. For example, in order to endow a
chair, a potential donor would only have to
contribute halt the normal amount, and
the rest of the funds would come from the
foundation's gift. The donation is written
using the term "challenge" to encourage
the University and potential contributors
to broaden the reach of the gift through
such methods as matching donations,
Etchemendy said.
"This will provide a huge amount of mo
tivation to faculty to go out and do more,"
Etchemendy said, commenting on a call
from Brest for faculty to spend 10 hours a
year out encouraging philanthropy "to en
sure the 112 uture of the school."
The University's needs
A member of the Humanities and Sci
ences Council, an advisory group, Walter
Hewlett became aware of the serious fi
nancial needs of the school over four years
ago, according to Etchemendy.
"What Stanford needs most, frankly, is
donor support for very flexible use,"
Etchemendy said. Because many dona
tions to the University are targeted to spe
cific areas or programs, University officials
are often unable to address the Universi
ty's most pressing needs, despite receiving
large gifts.
"This will affect every part of the Uni
versity," Etchemendy said. "An unrestrict
ed endowment provides continued sup
port for needs at the base level."
The situation: H&S
The majority of the gift, $300 million,
will go to the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Hennessy noted that "the University's
first president, David Starr Jordan, want
ed Stanford to be a place where 'work in

applied sciences is to be carried out side b\
side with the pure sciences and humani
ties.' " He said that, after leaving his posi
tion as dean of the School of Engineering
to become provost, he was surprised bv
the disparity in resources between the ap
plied sciences and the humanities and nat
ural sciences.
"Under Dean (of the School of Human
ities and Sciences Malcolm) Beasley's lead
ership, we began to understand the c hal
lenges [faced by the school]," Hennessv
said. The Provost's Office also began a
needs assessment of the entire University
that shed light on areas that were most
lacking.
"Resources are not available for faculty
in the humanities and sciences," I fennessv
said.

"Cost at any institution like this one is
largely salary," Ktchemencly said. "It can
cost .1 million [dollars] just to bring a facul
ty member to Stanford." lie continued, t it
ing the high cost ol living and providing
resources, among other expenses.
Hennessv also pointed out that only l'J
percent of the University's current endow
ment supplies the School <>l Humanities
and Sciences.
" Fhe scope of the gift allows us to think
in terms ot truly long-term growth," said
Biology Prof. Sharon Long, who will be
come dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences Sept. I.
Though the School of 1 lumanities and
Sciences is one of Stanford's largest
schools, it is also the youngest, having been
organized from a group of departments

into a whole only 50 years ago.
"The awesome generosity of the gift
speaks for itself " Beasley said. "What is
less apparent to those on the outside, per
haps. is the power this gift will have in
terms of strengthening the teaching,
learning and research that goes on at Stan
ford in disc iplines that we believe are at the
very core of the University's mission."
The situation: Undergraduates
11 ic remaining $100 million of the do
nation will go to the I Diversity's $ 1 billion
Campaign for Undergraduate Education.
Hall of this will endow undergraduate
scholarships, and the other hall will be ap
plied directly to undergraduate education
