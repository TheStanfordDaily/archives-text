## Gift to University the largest in history of higher education 
### NADIRA HIRA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Hie William and Flora Hewlett Founda
tion will make a gift of $400 million in unre
stricted funds to Stanford, Hewlett Founda
tion Chairman Walter B. Hewlett an
nounced yesterday at noon in the Quad.
$800 million of the donation will be directed
to the S< hool of Humanities and Sciences,
and the remainder is earmarked for the
(Campaign for Undergraduate Education.
According to Provost John Etchemendy,
this is one of the largest gifts ever given to an in
stitution of higher education and the largest
gift to an endowment, to the knowledge of
University officials.
Some 250 faculty, staff and students,
who were invited via e-mail to witness the
"unprecedented historical announce
ment,'' were on hand this afternoon to
hear Walter Hewlett, Hewlett Foundation
President Paul Brest, University President
John Hennessy, Etchemendy and other
University officials announce and com
ment on the donation.
"This gift is a tribute to my father," Wal
ter Hewlett said, referring to the late
William Hewlett, who established the
Hewlett Foundation. "It honors his life
time of philanthropy, his lifelong devotion
to Stanford and his passionate belief in the
value of a liberal arts education. Had he
lived, I am certain this is something he
would have done himself."
The donation
The Hewlett Foundation's gift to Stan
ford is the largest gift ever to one Ameri
can university and may be the largest in
the world, Scott Jaschik, editor of the
Chronicle of Higher Education, told the
Associated Press yesterday. A $360 million
donation to Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti
tute in Troy, N.Y., was the previous
record.
This donation is 20 times larger than
any other gilt given by the Hewlett Foun
dation. The unrestricted nature of the do
nation allows the University to utilize the

funds where they are needed.
Hewlett Foundation Director James C.
(iaither called the donation a "bold vision
ary step."
"We hope, too, that this gift will en
courage others in the philanthropic world
— individuals as well as foundations — to
think boldly about making major commit
ments to the universities and other institu
tions that are important to our future,"
Caither said.
According to Etchemendy, the Univer
sity aims to get matching donations for this
gift. For example, in order to endow a
chair, a potential donor would only have to
contribute halt the normal amount, and
the rest of the funds would come from the
foundation's gift. The donation is written
using the term "challenge" to encourage
the University and potential contributors
to broaden the reach of the gift through
such methods as matching donations,
Etchemendy said.
"This will provide a huge amount of mo
tivation to faculty to go out and do more,"
Etchemendy said, commenting on a call
from Brest for faculty to spend 10 hours a
year out encouraging philanthropy "to en
sure the 112 uture of the school."
The University's needs
A member of the Humanities and Sci
ences Council, an advisory group, Walter
Hewlett became aware of the serious fi
nancial needs of the school over four years
ago, according to Etchemendy.
"What Stanford needs most, frankly, is
donor support for very flexible use,"
Etchemendy said. Because many dona
tions to the University are targeted to spe
cific areas or programs, University officials
are often unable to address the Universi
ty's most pressing needs, despite receiving
large gifts.
"This will affect every part of the Uni
versity," Etchemendy said. "An unrestrict
ed endowment provides continued sup
port for needs at the base level."
The situation: H&S
The majority of the gift, $300 million,
will go to the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Hennessy noted that "the University's
first president, David Starr Jordan, want
ed Stanford to be a place where 'work in

applied sciences is to be carried out side b\
side with the pure sciences and humani
ties.' " He said that, after leaving his posi
tion as dean of the School of Engineering
to become provost, he was surprised bv
the disparity in resources between the ap
plied sciences and the humanities and nat
ural sciences.
"Under Dean (of the School of Human
ities and Sciences Malcolm) Beasley's lead
ership, we began to understand the c hal
lenges [faced by the school]," Hennessv
said. The Provost's Office also began a
needs assessment of the entire University
that shed light on areas that were most
lacking.
"Resources are not available for faculty
in the humanities and sciences," I fennessv
said.

"Cost at any institution like this one is
largely salary," Ktchemencly said. "It can
cost .1 million [dollars] just to bring a facul
ty member to Stanford." lie continued, t it
ing the high cost ol living and providing
resources, among other expenses.
Hennessv also pointed out that only l'J
percent of the University's current endow
ment supplies the School <>l Humanities
and Sciences.
" Fhe scope of the gift allows us to think
in terms ot truly long-term growth," said
Biology Prof. Sharon Long, who will be
come dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences Sept. I.
Though the School of 1 lumanities and
Sciences is one of Stanford's largest
schools, it is also the youngest, having been
organized from a group of departments

into a whole only 50 years ago.
"The awesome generosity of the gift
speaks for itself " Beasley said. "What is
less apparent to those on the outside, per
haps. is the power this gift will have in
terms of strengthening the teaching,
learning and research that goes on at Stan
ford in disc iplines that we believe are at the
very core of the University's mission."
The situation: Undergraduates
11 ic remaining $100 million of the do
nation will go to the I Diversity's $ 1 billion
Campaign for Undergraduate Education.
Hall of this will endow undergraduate
scholarships, and the other hall will be ap
plied directly to undergraduate education

through such measures as new re
search programs for undergradu
ates.
Hie campaign was announced
In Hennessy during his inaugura
tion as I Iniversity president ()ct. 20,
2000, as a promise to raise $I billion
for undergraduate education over
the next five years. It had already
raised $200 million In-fore it was
even announced, and its current
pledges amount to $500 million.
" The overall needs [of the c am

paign] are sort of tied up with the
changes that have been made in
Stanford Introductory Studies,"
Ktchemendy said. "Another large
part is our desire to increase re
search opportunities for under
graduates, and .t third really im
portant large part is our desire to
provide endowment for under
graduate financial aid."
"Bill Ilewlett was a great propo
nent of'undergraduate education,"
Hennessy saicl. "The goals of the
[c ampaign]. . . were very much his
goals for Stanford. Bill understood
that .it Stanford under'graduate
education and the School of Hu
manities and Sciences share a com

mon future."
A look at giving at Stanford
Stanford received $SHO million
in donations during the 2000 fiscal
year, leading all U.S. institutions.
This figure represents an K2 per
cent increase from lasi year.
According to the Office of De
velopment, this rise is a result of a
variety of causes, including four
fundraising drives and the recent
economic boom.
Fundraisers by the Hoover In
stitution, the Graduate School of
Business and the Law School
brought in a total of $365 million in
donations. This amount, com

bined with the funds from Stan
ford's fourth fundraiser — the
Campaign for Undergraduate Ed
ucation — placed the University
among the top donation recipients.
Corporate contributions and
gifts of cash, st<x k and other assets
from over 65,000 people — large
ly resulting from the booming
economy — also contributed sig
nificantly to this year's large dona
tion figure, according to Assoc.
Vice President for Development
Hob Pi ingle.
Pringle said that overall giving
has slowed, but University officials
say they hope the I lewlett Founda
tion's gift will promote more giving.

Hewlett and the foundation
William Hewlett, who graduat
ed from Stanford with a bachelor's
degree in electrical engineering in
1934, founded the Hewlett Foun
dation in 1966. He and lifelong
friend David Packard, whom he
met at Stanford and with whom he
foutided Hewlett-Packard in 1936,
have worked with and donated to
Stanford for more than 60 years.
Hewlett, Packard and their family
foundations had donated over
$300 million to the University be
fore yesterday's gift.
"We are indeed fortunate to
have friends like Bill Hewlett, the
Hewlett family and the Hewlett

Foundation," Hennessy said.
As the lead donor in each of
Stanford's three University-wide
campaigns, Hewlett provided
matching funds to help the Uni
versitv draw broad support for the
many professorships, graduate fel
lowships and undergraduate
scholarships that bear the names
of other donors, according to a
University press release.
"Bill Hewlett always was the
first person to step up whenever
the University had a genuine
need," Ktchemendy said.
