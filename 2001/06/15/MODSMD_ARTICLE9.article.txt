## The 						Stanford Daily Daily EIC finally finds the words to say goodbye 
### 
Published Sine* IS9I

The las! issue of mv high school newspaper
went to press on the day of my senior prom.
1 spent the whole morning working on the
paper, ran to my hair stylist at I p.m., came
l>a(k and wrote the editorial, rushed to the (lhanel
counter to get m\ makenpdoneat 3:30 p.m. and sped
bat k to s< liool to give the proofs a final glance. And,
when I walked out <»l the newsroom for the last time,
flats in hand ant I superhuman mother m tow, I locked
the dooi behind me — glad to have made our dead
line .ind f<« used on im next commitment — and said
goodbve without even realizing what had just ended.
Later that weekend, as my family discussed our
battle scats at the breakfast table with more than a
hint of soltlierlv pride, my mothei brought up that
moment outside the newsroom door. She saitl —
and she si ill loves to tell this storv, should anyone be
interested — thai, after everything that had gone
into inv year at 1 he West word, she had been ( urious
to see what would happen when I finally had to leave
it behind. Km not lung did. She watt lied me turn the
ke\ and walk away without much thought, and she
sa\s that's when she decided I had done all I wanted
lo tit) in lovelv Stamford, (lonn., and that she could
confidently send me off to new adventures 3,000
miles away.
Now, .is I prepare lo close the book on another
longt hapterof newspapei editing, it makes sense that
I in 1 eminded ol this storv. As anyone at The I ).iilvt an

attest, I have agonized over this farewell piece for al
most three weeks now. It should have appeared in
our end-quarter edition, which was distributed June
(i. But, as the newsrtxun emptied and my panic level
rose on the night of June 5, I found myself complete
ly without words.
Anyone who knows me will appreciate the rarity of
this situation, as I have nn*er been the speechless type.
I was the fifth-grader who wouldn't stop talking about
the (iulf War, the high school junior who just couldn't
gel over James Joyce, the college freshman who called
every friend on the fast (loast togush about Stanford.
But that night, of all nights, 1 was speechless.
Why? Not because I couldn't fill reams with my
thoughts on the last 15 weeks. And certainly not be
cause there isn't enough to say about where this paper
is or should be going. Hut I had something meaning
ful to say — the kind of thought that aches just be
neath your sternum antl makes you feel hopelessly
pretentious just because it exists — that I simply
couldn't articulate.
foday, I'm over that. For weeks, 1 have been try
ing to find the words to say that, finally, after three
years at Stanford and four months of breathing The
Daily, I've learned enough about myself to know who
I will be years from now, giving me the freedom mil to
worry about minor matters. Regardless of what law
school I attend, if I attend at all or how many years I
take tiff before attending, I am now and will always Ik

that girl of three years ago — the one who schedules
hair appointments between writing sessions, travels at
breakneck speed with a loved one or two on each
hand, and works knowing her optimism is foolish and
expecting it tolx* rewarded nonetheless.
And I love that. Especially because, even at this
pace, I know 1 will never be too busy tor baseball or ba
bies, or anything in between. And I also know that be
cause, in addition to that foolish optimism 1 men
tioned, my time at The Daily has taught me that noth
ing compares to the perfect and insane balance of a
newsroom full of people you love who are as passion
ate about watching our basketball team take its first
heartbreaking loss of the season as they are about
scrambling to put out the first issue of our volume
during the commercial breaks. Needless to say, that
first night, Feb. 4,2001, when 1 welcomed you to Vol
ume 219, I had already fallen in love with that bal
ance, .uul everything that would come with it.
That feeling, th.it deep ache for I he Daily's mad
ness and its people, was what I had to find and recap
ture to write this piece. So, now, with some 70 issues
soon to be under our belts, I am truly ready to say
goodbye, lliougli I will return to this newsroom
many times over the rest of my Stanford career, just as
1 still return to the one of my high school, 1 will always
remember it as it has been this volume: full of chal
lenges, rife with drama, always on the edge of a late
night and, still, happy at its heart.

In tht* weeks I spent harassing my staff'for sugges
tions about how to write this farewell, someone I love
dearly told me to write about being a mother to my
staff, and someone whose opinion matters to me very
much suggested 1 write about lieing a journalist.
Clearly, I'm neither a mother nor a journalist. But, in
retrospect, the juxtaposition of those two roles is a sur
prisingly accurate reflection of what this experience
has meant to me.
The Daily occupies a unique place in tli.it it aims to
be a professional organization with a serious journal
istic product, but it accomplishes those goals in a uni
versity setting with people who are probably at tfie
most tumultuous time of their lives. Anyone attempt
ing to guide an institution like this must address both
these aspects of its existence.
In reality, that means afternoon therapy sessions on
complicated relationships and invigorating c hats alxiut
amazing professors, or evenings spent arguing the finer
|H)inLs of Associated Press style and comforting editors
who haven't studied for the next day's 9 a.m. exam.
After that, being a mother and a journalist doesn't
seem easy, but it's certainly not as impossible as it
looked just a few months ago.
