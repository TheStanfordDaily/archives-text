## Unnatural disaster: 'Canes pound Cardinal 
### Brett Kaufman SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
OMAHA, Neb. — All week in Omaha,
head coach Mark Marquess repeated the
two reasons that his young Stanford team
was there: "pitching and defense, pitching
and defense."
Unfortunately for Marquess, the Cardi
nal didn't get much of either in the College
World Series championship game and lost
the June If) contest to Miami, 12-1, to finish
as the NCAA runner-up for the second con
secutive season.
I'he Hurricanes (53-12) pounded their
way through Stanford's pitching and look
advantage of several Cardinal miscues to
win their fourth CWS title and second in
three vears. I heir 1 1-run margin of victory
tied the ('WS record lor the most lopsided
title game ever and was the worst defeat ol
the season lor the Cardinal.
Starter Mike Cosling struggled through
two innings of what he t ailed "below aver
age st nil" hut escaped with a pair of zeros on
the Miami scoreboard. In the third, howev
er. he ran into trouble that would put Stan
lord (112) 1-17) in a hole from which it wouldn't
be able to recover.
After Costing bit a batter with one out.
Jaw Rodriguez laid down a perlect bunt
that junior \ndv I opham couldn't handle,
fopham failed to come up with the sort of
phenomenal |>la\ he has consistent!) made
.ill season, and the bunt single put two I lur
ricaneson base.
(iosling looked as il he could esca[>e after
he induced a high fly ball to right, but Car
los Quentin — one of four freshmen in the
stalling lineup — losi the ball off the bat.
Quentin camped in short right field, then
broke toward the warning track, only to
watch the ball bounce SO feet behind him.
Instead of having two outs and men on first
and second, Stanford found itself down a
run. with two Miami runners in storing po
sition and only one out.
"I didn't expect it could go over my
head." Quentin said. "But at the last minute
[second baseman (Ihris ()'Riordan] pointed

back and 1 saw it land."
With the ball, so went the Cardinal's
hopes of raising a third championship ban
ner at Sunken Diamond.
Hurricane third baseman Kevin
Howard followed Matienzo's RBI by draw
ing a walk to load the bases. Kevin Mannix
then doubled down the right-field line to
give Miami the 4-0 lead.
"I just never got into a rhythm," (iosling
said. "We got some bad breaks in that in
ning. 1 hat's baseball. 1 bat happens."
112 rom the moment Quentin lost the ball
in the sun, the Cardinal looked lost .it
Rosenblatt Stadium — the same ballpark
that Stanford has come to call home over the
past three seasons. The Cardinal bats man
aged just four singles off Miami starter l om
112 armer in bis 5 2/3 innings, and onl\ five
bits in the game.
file Cardinal finally spoiled the Hurri
i.ines' shutout on freshman Sain Fulcl's
sixth-inning bunt single to the right side.
()ther than the lone run, Stanford couldn't
break out olleusiveb as time ran out on its
dreamlike postseason run.
"Obviouslv, we're disappointed because
we didn't give diem mm h ola game," Mar
quess said. " I bey were the IxMter team
tod.i\. And, as the\ have the entire ( ollege
World Series, they kind of exploded and we
could get nothing going."
In the Miami half of the fourth, (iosling
looked to get back on track alter a 1 -2-3 in
ning, but the 1 lurricancs were far from fin
ished. Howard singled home Rodriguez in
the fifth, and Marquess elected to bring in
junior |ell Bruksch with none out and two
men on base.
After a sacrifice hunt, Kevin Brow n blast
ed a three-run shot over the left-center field
wall and Mike Rodriguez, hit a sacrifice lly to
put Stanford in a nine-run hole with just
twelve outs remaining. Bruksch had tied
records in ()maha with three saves this year
and four for bis career, but he entered the
championship game much earlier than
Stanford had hoped he would.
