Well, it's (or real now. They aren't com
ing back.
)ason and Jarron Collins left Stanford
basketball for good |nne 27, when both
were selected in the 2001 NBA Draft. Jason
was taken in the first round, 18th overall,
by the Houston Rockets, and was prompt

ly traded to the New Jersey Nets. |arron
was selected in the second round, 53rd
overall, by the I tali Jazz.
Projected as a mid- to late-first-round
pick, jason was onl\ the second senior se
lected in a draft seen In many a* a turning
point for the NBA. A record four high
schoolers were taken in the first round, all
in the top ten. kwame Brown ofC.lynn
Academy became the first-ever No. 1 pick
taken out of high school when he was
tabbed b\ the W ashington Wizards as their
top selection.
For Jason, the first-round pick justified
his decision to leave Stanford with two
years of eligibility remainining. Although

(lollins graduated in June with his (lass, lie
was granted medical redshirts after both
his freshman and sophomore years, which
he missed the hulk of due to knee and wl ist
injuries, respectively.
Questions ahout durability dogged
Jason throughout the pre-dralt process.
However, he found himself selected in
front of several more highly touted colle
giate centers, including Brendan I lavwood
of North Carolina — taken 20th overall by
Cleveland — and Arizona's I.oren Woods
— taken 46th by Minnesota.
Only live other Stanford players have
been drafted in the first round, the latest
being Mark "Mad Dog" Madsen, taken

29th overall by the Lakers. Jason's nod .it
18th nukes him the highest Cardinal pick
since Brevin Knight in 1997, who was
taken Kith overall by Cleveland.
Jarron, by contrast, fell close to the bot
tom of one of the deepest drafts in NBA
history. Projected anywhere from a late
first-round pick to undralted. Jarron was
only the fourth second-round draft pick in
Stanford history. With an unusually large
number of athletic big men in the draft,
Jarron's draft status was uncertain despite
impressive performances at several pre
draft camps, where he competed against
other potential draft pit ks.
Jarron's selection marks only
the second time two Cardinal
plavers have been taken in the
same draft; the lirst was in 19
when Rnss Lawlerand Ron l oin
sit were both taken In the Syra
cuse Nationals, now the Philadel
phia Ttiers, in the seventh and
11 th rounds, respectively.
I he immediate impact the
twins will make on the ranks ol
the NBA is unclear. I lie
prospects for tlieii lirst vears,
though, are radically dilferent.
Second-round draft picks
aren't guaranteed a roster spot,
so |arron will have to tr\ out and
make the team belore he t an sign
a contract. I lis chances are as yet
unclear, as the |a/v are still con
tacting free agents for trvouts.
Should he make the team, Jar
