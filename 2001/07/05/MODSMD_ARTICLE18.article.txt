Yes, these Lakers, who

Compared to the all-hcait,
gi iikl it -out 7Hei s. the

team could seem downright solt. I

the basket.
It was at limes like this I thought that if
I had onl\ gone to ( al. I'd he surrounded
In Californian Lakers fans, and I'd feel a
w hole lot better.
Well, ha\ing followed nn I.akers snue I
was a kid. let me tell \on what I know
about them. I his season, the I .akers strug
gled through a vear during which their
two big stars, Hrv.tnt and O'Neal — both
sure-lire Mali ofTamers when thev retire
— had creative differences over who

should li.i\e the hall and w ho should share
it. Considering how great each ol these
two pl.ners are. this is (ompleteK natural.
Imagine putting Wilt ( hanibei lain, one ol
the greatest centers ever, on the s.iine
team as Michael |ordan. and I think vou
would see them arguing about who the
hall-hog is.
Hut come the postseason, despite losing
disgruntled third st.u (Hen Rice to the
New York knicks during the previous
summer and missing the top plavoll seed
in the Western Conference, the Lakers
proceeded to sweep the Portland Frail
Hlazeis. tin' Sacramento Kings, and the
San Antonio Spin s — all lilt\ -win teams.
Just think about that loi a moment.
How much heart, and how much grit,
does it take fora team with two stars and a
supposedh weak hem li to be able to dom
inate the likes of Scot lie Pippen, Chris
Webber, and I im Duncan: Did vou sup
pose it was easv to come up with a game
plan to kii k the del l it res ol ,i Hlazers team
that was two deep at even position and
had taken the Lakers to seven games in
last war's conference finals? In demolish

Robinson, did the Lakers coast on the tal

Yes, the Lakers are talented — O'Ne.i
and Hrvant in particular. But that's not
the w hole storv. () Neal does in lad spend
a lot of time working on his free throws
Bryant worked a great deal on his olfen
sive game last summer to improve hi*
scoring this year, and had in the past
plaved on summer league teams when lit
didn't need to in order to develop tin
strong defensive skills he has today.
Just ,i couple of years ago, opposing
guards would blow right b\ Hrvant with
out so much as a step in between. Hut be
cause ol his hard work, Hrvant has (level
oped into a Irulv special player. I le bat k
up his words with actions.
And what about the rest of the team:
Derek Fisher sat out 62 games this seasoi
due to injury. but niiraculoush came bad
in great shape, shooting better than lit
ever has in his professional career.
()r perhaps it's not a miracle. 1 his is tin
same Derek Fisher who, as a rookie, sail
that he would work as hard as he couli
and would i hallenge then-Lakers All Stai
guard Nn k \ an I xel for his starting post

lion. Fisher has always toiled
hard, and unbeknownst to
many, while Ik- could not pl.u in
.1 real game, Fisher had been
keeping hinisell in shape and
working on his long-range
shooting while injured. Most
players come back I'rom .i long
injury out of shape and inelfcc
ti\e, but not Fisher.
And guess what? Van F.xel, .i
clutch player who played some
great ball lor the Lakers, got
traded to the Denvci Nuggets.
Fisher's still a Laker.
Finally, there's the pla\ ol
Lakers reserve Robert I lorry.
Quiet and nonchalant, Horn
plays his role well, Critics sa\
Horn only plays well during the
NBA Finals. I hat ma\ be true,
but some might argue there's no
better time to pla\ well. During
two NBA Finals appearances
with the Houston Rockets and
two with the Lakers, Horry
played relentless defense, and
drilled three-pointers .it precise
ly the right moments to present*
much-needed victories.
Chick I learn, the legendan
radio voice of the Lakers w ho in
vented basketball terms like
"slam dunk," "air ball" and "lin
ger roll," recites a trademark
tagline before going to commer
cial: " 1 his is your Lakers basket
ball network."
But when the Lakers are
reigning NBA champs, Hearn,
called the Cal Ripken of basket
ball broadcasting due to his 36-
year-old consecutive-games
streak, chooses another phrase:
" 1 his is your (lhampionship
Lakers basketball network."
For \et another year, Hearn
will be tising this latter phrase to
describe this great basketball
franchise. Fo Shacj and Kobe,
keep up the good work.

Jeffrey is " senior work nig in the area
this summer ami /taxing no attention to
the Xli. \ draft; the Lakers have
enough good /flayers.
