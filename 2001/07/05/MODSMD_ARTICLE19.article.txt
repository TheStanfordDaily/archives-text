(Counterclockwise from upper left) 1) Stanford's second straight CWS cham
pionship appearance ended again in disappointment. 2) Junior Jeff
Bruksch was unable to contain Miami's explosive offense. 3) Cardinal
junior first baseman Arik VanZandt (left) puts away Miami's
Charleton Jimerson. 4) Junior shortstop Scott Dragicevich (sliding)
batted .333 in the CWS. 5) Miami's 17th victory in a row put the cap
on their second championship season in three years.
