"A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is "Bicentennial Man"
u ithout Robin Williams and w iilia lew more brains. Ii
has good moments and good scenes, but the movie
doesn't hold together. Alter establishing .1 solid
premise and building nice suspense, Steven Spiel
berg. the film's director and screenwriter, chooses .1
contrived happ\ ending over letting the darker and
more depressing — and more interesting — themes
earn the movie. It's like Spielberg crunched "Pitino
chio." "2001: A Space Odyssex" and "K. 1." into a
giant pinata and then smashed then ston lines into .1
morass of papier-mache.
There are shimmers ot hope. I he spec ial effects
are very good. So are the performances In actors
I lalev Joel ()sment ("The Sixth Sense") and |ude I .aw
(" I he Fnemy Within," " l he falented Mr. Ripley"),
who bring out the best in one another, but the plot
overrides any good acting, taking a strange I -turn
|ust when the audience invests enough emotion in the
movie, l he final scene, which is intermixed with an
awkward voice-over, comes out ol left field. I lie tone
is all wrong as the ending devolves into a level of sap
piness that even a Disney film would find much too
sugar-coated.
1 hat's too bad fora proje< t that was the braitu hild
of the late Stanley Kubrick ("A Clockwork Orange,"
"Full Metal Jacket," "Eyes Wide Shut"). I le reported
ly developed the material lot more than 15 years Ih -
fbre passing it on to Spielberg. What we are left with is
an odd mixture — a pendulum that strangelv sways
from its dark opening to its hocus-pocus lighthearted
closing.
Osment stars as David, the first robot or "media"
capable of loving human beings. I le is given to a hus
band and wile (played by Sam Robards and Frances
O'Connor), who have just lost their son. They dress
David and read him stories as if he's human, and soon
forget that he isn't .1 real child. I le even sits with them
at the dinner table and acts like he's eating their meals
— mechas, we come to discover, can't consume lood
or else they self-destruct faster than Ben Affleck's act
ing skills in "Pearl 11 arbor."
I his all plavs rather well on the screen, like a more

evolved version off. II nlortiinately, then conies
Ac ill, when David is separated from his parents and
abandoned in the woods. Scared, he rims and the sto
i \ line continues to develop nit el\. Da\ id meets (iigo
lojoe (|ude I .aw), ;i media who is designed to sexual-
Iv satisfy humans. He's on the run too — wrongfulK
framed for murdering one of his c lients. (I his subplot
is underdeveloped and entirely unbelievable, but
never mind). Both David and Gigolo Joe are captured
and taken to .1 llesh fan. where met has are mutilated
for entertainment while humans cheer from the side

Spielberg needed 10 do was ( ill
the final 15 minutes <>l the film
and he would have had .» good
picture on his hands. Instead, he
drags the characters to a point
that is pure nonsense. The entire
stor\ unravels, as our faith in
"A.1." dissolves. It's too hit; of a
miscalculation to he forgiven.
However, there is one reason
to see the film — Halev |oel ()s

talented actor. After his Acadenn
Award nomination for " Ihe
Sixth Sense." he held his own
against Keven Spacex and Helen

In "A.1.," Osment's role is
even more complex. He pene
trates the boundaries <>l human
.md robot and gives us ,i charac

strong. His performance is real,

"A.1." comes to a logical conclusion — and all


Courtesy Warner Brothers & Dreamworks
Steven Spielberg and Haley Joel Osment on the set of
"A.I. Artificial Intelligence."

Spielberg needed 10 do was ( ill
the final 15 minutes <>l the film
and he would have had .» good
picture on his hands. Instead, he
drags the characters to a point
that is pure nonsense. The entire
stor\ unravels, as our faith in
"A.1." dissolves. It's too hit; of a
miscalculation to he forgiven.
However, there is one reason
to see the film — Halev |oel ()s
-ment. 1 le is growing into quite a
talented actor. After his Acadenn
Award nomination for " Ihe
Sixth Sense." he held his own
against Keven Spacex and Helen
I hint in 'Ta\ it Forward."
In "A.1.," Osment's role is
even more complex. He pene
trates the boundaries <>l human
.md robot and gives us ,i charac
ter who is both vulnerable and
strong. His performance is real,
but sadl\ the ending is not.
