# Stone Temple Pilots are back from the brink and soaring

### JEREMY KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
II you are willing to put in the
time (and you should) to listen to
Stone Temple Pilots' new release
— the rhythmically titled
"Shangri-LA DEE DA," you will
embark on a journey through a
gutsv album by the Grammy
Winning rock band. I lie album,
with its various sounds and
styles, proves the artistic creden
tials of one of the best California
bands to emerge from the
grunge era of the 19905.
Present are the hard rock
sounds expected of S I l\ hut
rather than settle into expecta
tions, the band has the courage
to slow themselves in order to ex

plore more melodies that test
lead singer Scott Weiland's voice
and the rest of the band's mettle.
Like the crashing surf of Mal
ibu where the album was created
and written, the album drifts —
never finding one sound and
sticking to it —which, on the first
listen, disorients the listener.
Radio friendly songs such as
"Days of the Week," "Transmis
sions from a Lonely Room" and
"Long Way Home" save the
album on that first listen. But
don't give up on Weiland and
crew, for the band has taken
some leaps with "Shangri-LA
DEE DA," and the effects need
time to permeate expectations of
a hurried rock album.
"Days of the Week" is the

catchiest of these tunes and will
invite you into the album, but
don't be caught on your heels by
the "l'lush'-like tune. The album
holds more surprises that are
worth investing in.

After two or three listens you
will begin to recognize the album
for what it is: a collection of
episodes assumed lost l>\ Scott
Weiland's unfortunate past
brushes with drug use and
prison time. The band, which
lost almost two years to Weiland's
legal issues and detox time, re
turns with their usual slamming
roc k beats in "Dumb Love" and
"Hollywood Bitch." Yet they also
experiment with a tune like
"Hello it's Late," which is heavih
influenced l>\ Brazilian compos
er Antonio Carlos Jobim's classi
cal sounds.
Although not their first album
since their return to the music
scene ("No. 4" released in 1999
went platinum), the band seems

to he making the point on this
album that they aren't wasting
anymore time and are instead
using their time to continue t<
evolve musically.
"Shangri-LA DKF DA" start>
where its avid fans often remi
nisce about and long lor, to tlu
hard, edg\ rock songs where the
guitar is loud and \Veiland'>
