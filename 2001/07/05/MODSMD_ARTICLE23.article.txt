# 'EXTREME' viewers let in on the action
## 
### MELISSA RAPP 
Viewing Jon Long's latest
I MAX film. " KX I REM E," makes
one want — more than anything
— to jump into the picture. To
join the windsurfers, gracefully
double somersaulting off the
backs of waves, to glide through
powder as fine as dust with ex
treme snow boarders, to surf into
a .SO-foot wave and ride it.
I'he I MAX screen is probably
the closest most of us will ever
get to such incredible stunts,
which require t are physical skill,
talent, daring and experience.
Luckily, I MAX brings us prett\
damn close. Touted as the
"world's most sophistic ated cine
matic experience," I MAX is def
initely worth the $9.05 admis
sion price.
Although "EX I RKMI " fea

tures mam incredible athletes,
the real heroes of this film are
the camera crew, who must be
daredevils in their own right to
get .is close to the action as they
did. I he men and women be
hind the screen capture shot
after breathtaking shot of ex
treme athletes doing their thing.
The end result is poetry in
motion, as snowboarders leave
perfect ribbon-like tracks down
creamy, vertical snow fields, gi
gantic round wavec iests swallow
diminutive surfers —only to spit
them out after heartstopping
seconds. Ice-climbers inch their
wa\ up spec tac ular ice waterfalls
— fro/.en mid-stream onto sheer
rock cliffs — and windsurfers
maneuver their colorful sails
into tandem flips over rocking
waves. Like other extreme
sport documentaries, "EX
TREME" catches death-delving
stunts on camera, including a
few colossal wipeouts. Hut this
movie goes bevond mere docu
mentation — its arrestingly
beautiful imagerv and carefulh
arranged shots transform a
sport Hick into an art film.
The camera work in "EX

TREME," which features main
aerial shots, combines with the
music and voice-overs (provided
by the ac tual athletes) to create .1
mood and theme for the movie.
The mood is mellow and almost
spiritual, providing an interest
ing contrast to the adrenaline
lilled stunts. 111 discussing their
professions, the athletes demon
strate a surprising humility.
"You don't want to beat the
mountain," one extreme skier
said, "it will always be stronger
than you, you want to be in har
mony with it — to understand
how it functions."
World windsurfing champion
Robbv Naish described the ex
perience of catching the first
wave of the day.
"It's an amazing feeling —
being close to that much power."
Naish said. "You have to respect
the amount of power that's
there."
Rock climber Lynn Mill
demonstrated a similar respect
for nature's energv, describing it
as, "the best form of art." The
athletes also discuss then feelings
in the face of death. One moun
taineer <lis( ussed the necessity of

having fear
and knowing
one's bound
aries.
"I have to
have tear,"
she said.
"Fear is the
thing that
keeps you
sane. With
out fear
you'd do
so in e th i n g
insane. I
learn to se-

lect from my fear, to determine
what's real, what's imaginary."
At times, the film's messages
seemed slightly affected. Al
though it includes some cool
tracks, the soundtrack sounds a
little too new-agey — you can
onlv listen to Enya for so long be
fore you feel like you're unwit
tingly falling into a stupor. Also,
so many of the shots pulled back
into aerials that the movie lac ked
a sense of immediacy. Although
people who work as hard on
their bodies as these athletes do
are generally hot stuff, we rarely
goi to see close-ups of faces, or.

even more importantly, biceps.
In fact, one of the best parts of
the movie came during the cred
its, when the filmmakers finally
humanized t lit* subjects by show
ing some candids of athletes
goofing off and chowing down.
Despite these quibbles, "EX-
I RKMI " is an awesome experi
ence. If von are athletic and out
doors)', then get to San Francis
co. Besides offering a thrilling
visual experience, it will provide
inspiration to shake off your
mid-summer, stuck-on-campus
doldrums and experience some
adventure!

what's real, what's imaginary."
At times, the film's messages
seemed slightly affected. Al
though it includes some cool
tracks, the soundtrack sounds a
little too new-agey — you can
onlv listen to Enya for so long be
fore you feel like you're unwit
tingly falling into a stupor. Also,
so many of the shots pulled back
into aerials that the movie lac ked
a sense of immediacy. Although
people who work as hard on
their bodies as these athletes do
are generally hot stuff, we rarely
goi to see close-ups of faces, or.

even more importantly, biceps.
In fact, one of the best parts of
the movie came during the cred
its, when the filmmakers finally
humanized t lit* subjects by show
ing some candids of athletes
goofing off and chowing down.
Despite these quibbles, "EX-
I RKMI " is an awesome experi
ence. If von are athletic and out
doors)', then get to San Francis
co. Besides offering a thrilling
visual experience, it will provide
inspiration to shake off your
mid-summer, stuck-on-campus
doldrums and experience some
adventure!
