An article in the |une 15 issue of
Genes and Development explains a
I niversilx ol Pennsylvania Medical
S( hool project that explored the role ol
apoptosis — an internal cellular re
sponse that initiates cell death — in the
treatment of diseases like cancer.
Apoptosis is crucial to the elimination

of diseased cells, a form of protection
cancer cells have been able to defuse.
I he researchers have found that two
B( 1-2 family proteins that reside on mi

t<)(hondria, Bax and Bak. initiate
apoptosis.
Bax and Bak art* responsible lor turn
ing oil the mitochondria. Without tlit*
two proteins, the mitochondria can pro
diu e an endless snpph ol energ\ for the
cell, rendering it virtualh immortal.
I he resean het s found that cells without
Bax or Bak cannot even he killed with
chemotherapy or irradiation.
I'll is helped confirm the widely held
belief that chemotherapy and irradia
tion trick cancer cells into self-destruc
tion by turning the two proteins on,
causing the mitochondria to shut down
.ind stop giving energy to the cell. I lie
hope is that with this new understand

iug, improved taiuer treatments can be
created and therapies to prevent cell
death during strokes and heart attacks
will be made a\ ai I able.
Stanford I niversit\ researchers have
published new findings about nicotine.
I he article, in the )ul\ issue ol Nature
Medicine, reports th.it contrary to their
expectations, nicotine injections actual
ly increased the rate of blood vessel for
mation in mouse models of atheroscle
rosis, cancer, ischemia and inflamma
tion. 1 he findings are not entirely posi
tive because blood vessel formation in-

i leases the How of required nutrients to needy (ells,
including harmful ones like cancer cells. I lie report
indicates that the vessel formation helped restore
blood flow lo the ischemic, or blood-obstructed,
limbs of mice; ii does the same for tumors and ath
erosclerotic plaques, allowing them to grow more
quit kl\ than normal.
I he researchers have been able to identify some ol
the agents that promote this endothelial cell — cells that
line our inner body cavities — growth. I'hese types ol
cells, along with neurons and smooth-muscle < ells, have
.1 nicotine receptor that responds to a handful ol mole
cules that are unregulated in the presence ol nicotine.
1 he challenge for researchers now is to try to lo
calize the reactions of each cell type in tin- presence
of these molecules to find out more specifically how
the molecules influence the formation of blood ves
sels. 1 "he final consideration is the application of
these findings onto the current body ol knowledge
concerning smoking-related dangers.
The paper emphasizes that the 4,000 chemicals
other than nicotine in cigarettes are toxic to en
dothelial cells. These new findings about nicotine
do little to dampen previous anti-vascular reports
about cigarettes, and even less to dispel the risk in
volved with smoking them.
