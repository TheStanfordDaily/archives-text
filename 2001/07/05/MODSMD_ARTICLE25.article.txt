An article in the |une 15 issue of
Genes and Development explains a
I niversilx ol Pennsylvania Medical
S( hool project that explored the role ol
apoptosis — an internal cellular re
sponse that initiates cell death — in the
treatment of diseases like cancer.
Apoptosis is crucial to the elimination

of diseased cells, a form of protection
cancer cells have been able to defuse.
I he researchers have found that two
B( 1-2 family proteins that reside on mi

t<)(hondria, Bax and Bak. initiate
apoptosis.
Bax and Bak art* responsible lor turn
ing oil the mitochondria. Without tlit*
two proteins, the mitochondria can pro
diu e an endless snpph ol energ\ for the
cell, rendering it virtualh immortal.
I he resean het s found that cells without
Bax or Bak cannot even he killed with
chemotherapy or irradiation.
I'll is helped confirm the widely held
belief that chemotherapy and irradia
tion trick cancer cells into self-destruc
tion by turning the two proteins on,
causing the mitochondria to shut down
.ind stop giving energy to the cell. I lie
hope is that with this new understand

iug, improved taiuer treatments can be
created and therapies to prevent cell
death during strokes and heart attacks
will be made a\ ai I able.
