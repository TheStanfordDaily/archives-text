# Start-up company reduces medical errors for doctors
## epocrates INTUITIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE MEDICAL MIND 
### VIC REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During your next checkup, you might
catch your doctor scribbling on a Palm
handheld device as you describe your
s\ mptonis. Don't feel ignored — vour doc
tor might just be accessing a database ol
medical information put out by a startup
company called ePocrates, and not just
adding an item to his Palm to-do list.
In 1998, two former healthcare indus
try consultants founded ePocrates. Dr.
Richard Fiedotin and Jell langney first
formed a friendship as students at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business and
then formed .1 company that today has two
signature products, (|R\ and qld. Both
(|R\ and qld are database applications for
the Palm Operating System, and are free
to download from the ePocrates Website.
I he company's business plan is to lever
age its network of users.
"We are paid by third parties to provide
information to physicians," 112 iedotin said.
In short, sponsors pay ePocrates to tell its
users about insurance policies, surveys
and other services that the\ provide. For
example, last week the company an
nounced th.it it had partnered with Mar
ket Measures Interactive, .1 health re
search company. I'ogether, they will re
cruit healthcare professionals for Web
based market research.
Doctors can install qRx on their Palm
handheldsand have information 011 prescrip
tion drugs always on hand. ePocrates updates
the information regularly and a clinical board
reviews each drug entry. Fat h entry includes
tips 011 dosing, possibly dangerous drug in
teractions. packaging and pricing.
c|ld is a similar program that provides
doctors with information on infectious dis
eases. With over -400 diseases and 100
drugs in its database, it is <1 useful tool for

doctors trying to determine the correct
anti-microbial treatment lor a patient.
Both products have had an impact. Ac
cording to a recent Harvard Medical
School study. 50 percent of doctors who
use (|Rx avoided one or more adverse
drug events — injuries incurred using a
drug — a week. In November, the Ameri
can Medical Informatics Association esti
mated that more than 2 million adverse in
teractions were avoided in the last year
due to the use of qRx.
Most ol the adverse drug events ih.it have
been averted would not have been fatal.
However, in one recent case in Appleton,
Wisconsin, qRx saved a lift-. To treat .1 pa
tient sullering from severeh low blood pres
sure, an intensive tare nurse began to ad
minister the drug dopamine. But the phvsi
-1 ian on hand had a hunch that there might

lit 1 an adverse interaction between
dopamine and the drug Dilantin, which (lie
patient was taking to control seizures. Dr.
David |.11 \ is took out his Palm, launched
<|R\. and learned that he was light.
In fact, dopamine and Dilantin can in
teract to cause severe hypotension — po
tential fatal low blood pressure — so Dr.
Jarvis found another drug to treat Ins pa
tient. With success stories like this one, it's
no wonder that <|l\\ and <]ld are becoming
increasingb popular with dot tors.
.According to Marketing Director I.ydia
(ireen, elVx rates is successliil txx~au.se o! one
key functional difference Ix-tween its prtxlucts
and tlioseofcom|)etitors such as iScribe, whit h
sells similar applications for the Palm < )S.
"<)ther companies have tried to t liange
physicians' behavior by getting them to do
electronic prescribing, and doctors are just
not doing it." she said. An clectroni< data
base. on the othei hand, is a simple idea
with a gentle learning < urve.
"()ur software is very intuitive and ver\
eas\," (ireen said. "Dot tors hesitant to use
tei hnology can figure it out in minute."
Kach month, 2f>,oood<x tors choose to do
just that — they join ePtxrates' user base,
now at 300,000. liedotin estimated that his
i ompaiiN li.is 80 to 00 percent of the market
share. Although ePtxrates is not currently
profitable. I iedotin believes it soon will be.
In addition toco-founders I iedotin and
I angnev, several other members of tlie
ePocrates management team are also
Stanford alumni. Senior Vice President ol
Kngineering Joe lalcone earned .1 gradu
ate degree in Klectrical Kngineering, and

( liicl Medical Officer and Director <>l
Product Development I lionias H. Lee got
his MBA from the (iraduate School ol
lousiness.
Ihe St.in lord Medical ('.enter benefits
directlv from el'ocrates' connection to
Stanford. Iheconipam provides l'alm Yx
devices loaded with its software at a dis
count to medical students, faculty and
staff. A similar program has been estab
lished with Duke I niversitv, but Duke
doctors do not receive a discount.
Recentlv. C.liiel I'echnical Officer Dan
/m kei, who graduated with a doctorate in
Klectriral Kngineering from Stanford, left
the companv, but according to Fiedotin,
el'ocrates is still on track.
"Dan is a great engineer, but the hole
has been filled," fiedotin said. "We still
have a great team."
l in er new products are in the works at
el'ocrates. In August, the conipam plans
to release software that will help physi
cians make sense ol insurance policies as
tlie\ prescribe drugs. "It will integrate in
surance information with clinical informa
tion," l iedotin said.
Also in the works is a reimbursement
program for doctors who share informa
tion with el'ocrates' market resean li part
ners. Lastly, el'ocrates will throw its hat
into the electronic prescriptions ring,
promising on its Website "to develop a
trouble-free e-prest ribing solution — one
that will in.ike your lile easier, not hard
er." F.xpect to see these powerful new
tools in your doctor's l'alm at your next
hospital \isit.
