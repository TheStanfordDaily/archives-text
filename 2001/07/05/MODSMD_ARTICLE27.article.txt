"Teclmolog\ is often geared to the
business environment," Kthan Rikleen,
who has been a residential computing
coordinator and is now a network and
systems administrator at Stanford, said.
"This conference gives people the op
portunity to explore the resources in an
academic environment."

the telecommunications and residen
tial networking and support fields
were present at the fair, including

Apple, SUN, Dell. Cisco, and Adobe.

wavs interesting to watch and occa
sionally there is something to learn."
Heather Bell, a residential spe
cialist from Northern Arizona Uni
versity was .111 example of the first

opening experience."
"I saw how other colleges deal with
similar problems to outs. And I also
saw that sometimes it is we who have

I'lie main events included eight

included developing a R( X' program,
distributed computing, anti-virus
strategies and hiring of women.
Allan Chen, one of the principal or
