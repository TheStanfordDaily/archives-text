that there is no dilfcrenc e in nutrition

have made in the iva\ ilie\ study nutrition.
(iardner briefh outlined die historv of nu
t lit ion in t lit* 20th century.
In the earl) 1900s, scientists studied
diet deficiencies, such as (he lack of vita
min which results in scurvv. As foods
evcntualh became fortified, there was .1
shift from under-nutrition to over-nutri
tion, and the im idence ol chronic diseases
int'hiding cancel and heart attacks —

As ,1 result, people started avoiding
foods containing excess amounts of un
wanted nutrients like fat and cholesterol.
However, "Scientists did a disservice b\
hammering home .1 message of avoid
ant e." (iardner said.
In the 1900s, there was .1 shift from
nutrient avoidance to nutrient inclusion
more specificallv, the inclusion ol
phvtot lieniicals. I hese are plant-based
chemicals like Iblit acid and beta
-1 a 1 olene. I low ever, studies have shown
tli.it phvtochcmical supplements do not
necessaril\ increase overall health,
since benefits ina\ result from the foot Is
that ph\tot hemic .11s are found in.

rather than from the phytochemicals
themselves.
(lurrently. another shift — from pho
tochemical inclusion to a more general
food pattern inclusion — is gaining mo
mentum. According to experts, the latest
version of a healtln diet consists of an
ample amount of grains, vegetables,
fruits and nuts. Moreover, most foods
should he plant-based and appropriateh
processed. I lowever. at i ording tt) (iard
ner, the kr\ to healtln eating is varietx
and moderation.
In assessing diet, he suggests that
people ask themselves two questions,
first, how does m\ next foot I choice fit
into ni\ overall diet todav? Second, if I
don't choose this, which alternative will
I (boose?
In a larger context, according to
(iartlner. a bealtln eating pattern, com
bined with a healtln both weight, a de
sirable lipid profile .uitl normal blood
pressure, result in good health over.ill.
College students should also tr\ to fol
low these guidelines, sini e the adoption
of a healtln diet is a lifelong process.
