## EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK Summer editor urges community to reflect 
### SCOTT DORFMAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Summer is here .ind the signs
arc .ill around us: new laces have
appeared on campus, old ones
have left and temperatures and
dining hall meal pi i< es ha\e i isen
to unbearable heights. Kven so,
sometimes ii just doesn't leel like
summer, .it least like the sum
mers I regard .is among the best
of mv life.
Reinenihei when summer
hreak was at tnall\ suininei break?
()r w hen alter a long s( hool veai
tilled unli learning multiplication
tables, phonies and other impor
tant knowledge, vou had three
months to do almost am thing vou
wanted? Kcmcmhei when we .ill
had ample time lo just sit I>.u k and
think, unhampered l>\ v\oi k. er

i ands and othei commitments?
Neither do I.
Now, as 1 enter m\ senioi vear
at St.inlord, the davs ol carefree,
Â»ontemplative summers have long
since passed. Somewhere along
the wav. summer took a turn for
the worse: childhood became
adulthood, beat h trips became in
ternships and summer break liter
ally became a kind of summer
quarter, with time commitments
and stress levels equivalent to
those ol lall. winter and spring.
Worst ol all, the drive lot money,
sii((css and resume building has
lelt almost no free time lor reflec
tion. I lie kind ol reflection that
allows you to spend time thinking
about one's self and one's sur
roundings jiisi a little longer and a
little deeper.
Ii is this spirit ol reflection that

I'lie Stanford Weekh hopes to
capture this summer. While I
have learned mm h about the out
side world through lectures and
seminars, I've had precious little
time to reflect upon the people,
places and events of Stanford and
the stories that make it such a
unique universitx.
I he Stanford lam Ist ape, i i< Ii in
history, talent and personalities,
has thousands ol stories to tell,
some of w hit h we hope to explore
in the issues to come. I lie weekh.
maga/ine style of I lie Weekh w ill
allot (I our stall the opportuiiit\ to
take a step bat k and look at the big
pit lure surrounding the issues
and people that shape campus.
We hope not onh to find the sto
ries that make Stanford unique,
but also explore them and reflect
upon each storv's significance to

the Stanford experience.
l or you students that are from
outside Stanford enrolled in
summer camps and classes, 1 lie
Weekly will he vour first expo
sure to campus news and an in
troduction to Stanford culture.
We hope that you will make the
paper a part of vour weekly rou
tine tins summer and utili/e our
w riling as a starting point for dis
covering Stanford.
Whether new or returning
conuminit\ member, 1 welcome

about Stanford, or just have an
interest in journalism or writing,
we would love to have you ion

stall that reflects the diversity of
the summer population, one

that includes international visi
tors, high school students and
other guests from outside the
Stanford community.
1 hope you enjoy this and fu
ture issues of I he Stanford Week
ly. It is our goal to inform and en
tertain you, and also prompt you
to think just a little deeper about
your Stanford experience. For
most ol us, childhood has yielded
to adulthood, hut I hope th.it at
least for one hour each week, I he
Weekly will help you reflect on
why you are here and where you
are going. Enjoy.
