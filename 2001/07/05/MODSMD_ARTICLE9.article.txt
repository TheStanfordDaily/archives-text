## White House incident spotlights national prejudice 
### SAMEER AHMED GUEST COLUMNIST 
\\ VSIIINC; I ON. D.C.. - Intern
ing in the nation's capital is not as
t*xtiti as Monica l.cwinsk\
would uani ns to believe. Pit tine
t lie movie "()llice Spat e." 1 epl.ic e
the computer s t ientists with am
bitions political science majors,
and vol 111 know what 1 mean.
I mil June 2«S. m\ roommate
\bdnllah Al-Arian was voni av
erage D.C. intern. A rising se
nioi at Dnke I niw-isit\ double
majoring in politit al si ience and
histoi N, Abdullah spent Ins
weekda\s interning lot House
Minoritx Whip David Bonioi
(I)-Mit higan) to further Ins in
terest in law and publii service.
And alter .i long da\ at work,
Abdullah, our othei housemates
and I would come home and
play .i lew games ol basketball
belore dinnertime.
()n June 28, Abdullah did not
come home lor dinner. He was
still .it Bonior's office answering
questions from ( NN. the BBC,
Phe New York limes, I lie
Washington Post. Newsweek,
I he Associated Press, Al Jazeera

and a number ol other woi Itl
wide media outlets.
I hat moi ning. w bile Abdullah
w.is attending ,i White House
briefing with members ol the ()f
-fice ol faith-Based and C.omniu
nit\ Initiatives, a Set ret Service
agent escorted him out ol the
meeting without am explana
tion. Once \htlullah was re
moved, about two do/en leaders
Iroin various \meritan Miislnn
organi/ations walked out of the
meeting in protest, sparking a
media I'renzy.
I he int itlent fori etl President
(ieorge W. Bush to apologi/e the
lollowing da\, (.illing the Set ret
Service's treatment ol Abdullah
"wrong" and "inappropriate."
farlier, the Set ret Service issued
a stali'inent calling Abdullah's ex
pulsion a simple "mistake."
\ mistake? I lardlv. Abdullah's
onl\ crime was that he is .i Mus
lim of Palestinian descent, and
his expulsion from the White
1 louse was jiist another example
ol the erroneous and racist belief
prevalent across the I nited
States that labels Muslims, espe
i iallv Arabs, as anti-Ameriian se
curitv threats.

I nfortunately, this attitude
has spread to the Hush White
House. | list .1 week before Ab
dullah's ousting, Vice President
1)k k (;hene\ canteled .1 meeting
with members ol the American
Muslim Council alter the Zionist
Organization of \merica re
leased .1 statement labeling the
mainstream American Muslim
group au "extremist anti-Ameri
can organization."
Perhaps the pinnae le ol the
anti-Muslim and anti-Arab senti
ment 111 the I nited States is
demonstrated In the Secret I vi
dence Act, passed in Congress as
a part ol the 199b anti-terrorism
law. l'he Secret Kvidence Act al
lows the Immigration and Natu
ralization Service, without pro
viding any proof, to arrest and
detain indeliniteh an\ non-l .S.
citizen il he or she is deemed "a
threat to national securitN."
For example, Abdullah's
11111 le, M.izen .VI-Najjar, was<oll
- in a Florida jail for three
and a hall years, never ( barged
with a crime and then finally re
leased b\ Attorney General Janet
Reno late last year after the I S.
government admitted it had no

e\ idem e to keep Al-Najjar in jail.
111 addition to 1 ompleteb con
tradicting the Sixth Amendment
ol the I nited States (lonsti tut ion,
the Secret Fvidence At t is used as
a legalized form of racial profil
ing. ()l the more than 20 people
arrested under the act, all but
one have been a Muslim or Arab
male. For these reasons, two
years ago, Bonior and Stanford
Law I'rof Fom Campbell intro
duced House Resolution 2121,
which would repeal the Secret
Fvidence Act. While President
bush claimed to support 11R
-2121 during his campaign — a
transparent attempt to attract the
Vrab and Muslim vote — the bill
is still being debated in (Congress.
Which brir it's us back to Ab
dullah, who has been working
with bonior to repeal the Secret
Fvidence Act. For the past week,
Abdullah lias felt the benefits as
well as the disadvantages of his 15
minutes of fame. On the one
hand, Muslim leaders through
out the world have been refer
ring to Abdullah as a Rosa Parks
lor Muslim t i\il rights in Ameri
ca. On the other hand, some
news organizations have been

unfoundedly linking his lamiK to
terrorist groups.
When Abdullah finally re
turned home on the night ol
June 28 and was getting read\ loi
bed, I told him that, 10 years
from now, he'd look back to tli.it
day, sift through the newspapei
and magazine clippings and
laugh. Yet, while Abdullah con
tinues to be amazed b\ the
amount of press coverage lie has
been receiving, he has remained
apprehensive. Abdullah sa\s he
fears that the Secret Service's
"mistake" could haunt him in the
future. Hut let us hope that tin
reverse will become true. Hope
lull). Abdullah has taught the
Bush administration, which
claims int lusiveness. and the
American public, which values
diversity, the dangers of cultural
and religous prejudice.

Rising junior Sameer Ahmed, an
International Relations major and
former Daily Managing Editor, for
gives Abdullah Al-Arian for being
a Duke basketball fan, his only real
crime. You can reach Sameer at
