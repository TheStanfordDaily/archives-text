Boa i (I ol I nistees are cur relit 1\ negotiating .1
sol lit ion regard ing 1 licit < onllict ing ( audi date
selet t ion polities.
While the Board ol I nistees wishes 10 retain
Una I jurisdiction over w 11 u li indi\ulu.ils ultiinate
l\ .ire on the Board, the ASSI contends that the
process ol selecting multiple candidates Ironi
w hi< li the Board (.111 make a final selet tion is nn
(oust iintional.
According to (.hair (»l the Board ol 1 nistees
lsaa» Stein, "the new process that we've adopted
as the Board ol I ruslees is that 111 putting togeth
er the people on the committees, we asked the
groups to submit multiple names so that we can
best matt li abilities and experience with the needs
of eat h < onunittee."
I"he change 111 the process was accepted and
adopted In the lat ultv and was initialb agreed to b\
the VSSI However, the ASSI 's parliamentarian,
Harris Shapiro, a doctoral student in physics, later
rejet ted it on the b.isis Ill.it ii was not in accordance
wit 11 the ASSI \ constitution.
I Ik- conunision then submitted one nomination
e.u li of undergraduate and graduate students to the
Board ol I nistees lor membership. I lie Board ol

I nislees lias neither ac(epted nor dei lined die nom
inations, l)i11 is ( urrenth working with a committee
(omprised <»l ASS I represeniaiives to tr\ and come
lo .111 equitable arrangement.
"We've expressed that we're certainh happ\ and
willing to tr\ to accommodate, provided that, in the
end. the Hoard ol 11 ustees has final governance over
who its menibeis are," Stein said.
At cording to junior Henr\ I owsner, chair ol the
Nominations Commission, "We leel it's realh im
portant that students have a sa\ on these committees,
and this consists of having students we leel will put in
the time and energ\ lor the job on the Board."
Stein contends that the Hoard must retain control

over who its meml)ers are on the
basis that each of the committees
has internal needs and require
ments that must he met in order
to create the hest cumulative com
bination o! talents between its
members.
"An important issue to under

stand is that we do not have rep
resentatives on the committees,"
Stein said. " I lie members have
the experiences and the abilities
of the diflerent constituents, but
the\ are not representatives of,
sa\, the student body. We do not
have our members speak on be
half of parts of the I niversitv."
1 lie commission has the re
sponsibilih of selecting and nom
inating students the\ view as the
most capable and well-suited to

serve on over 40 University com
mittees, including the Board of
Trustees' committees.
"An essential part [of hav
ing students on these com
mittees] is that the students
remain in control of the
prot ess," lowsner said.
I lie Board committees do
not meet until Oct., In which
11me the \SSI . GSC .1 nd
Board of I rustees must have
resolved the issue.
