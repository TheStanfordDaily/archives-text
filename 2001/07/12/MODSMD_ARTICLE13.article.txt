## DAILY VIEWPOINT 30 ways to rule out a future career in politics 
### EZRA CALLAHAN Guest Columnist 
Stanford Magazine, the hi
niontliK publication ol flic Stan
lord Alumni Association, rareh
finds its wa\ onto the reading lisi•«.
ol most students here, lint last
tall, one partii ulai article that
outlined a list ol 10] things all
Stanford undergraduates should
do w hilt* at the l allll did (an ha
lot ol people's attention.
I he magazine's list < ontained
most ol the well-known Stanford
traditions, like going fountain
hopping, gelling kissed .it lull
Moon on the Quad voui Iresli
nian \eai and learning the Axe
\ ell. It also had a < on pie ol more
obscure entries, such as getting
into a hike accident, getting a
parking lie kel and gi\ ing blood.
Kui while the Alumni \sso< ia
lion covered most of what consti
tutes a full Stanford experience
from a (•-rated, public-relations
polished standpoint, (licit 101
tilings did not seem to rcalh < ap
ture the true essence ol what one
can do in four vears here.
Alter all, Stanford studenls are
typical American college stu
dents. and tvpical American col
lege students do things that nor
mal. rational adults never would.
I liesc are the things we wished
we hadn't done, the things we
couldn't believe we did, the things
we mavbe shouldn't have done.
Yet however disastrous the»onse
quences, these things seem to be
some of the most memorable mo
ments in our Stanford » a reel s.
So I've compiled an addendum
list to the Alumni Association's 101
things all undergrads should do, a
list ol the more sketi h\ things that
a whole lot of us manage to do
during our vears here. Of course
some of the things that follow are
liighK questionable on legal and
or moral grounds, but these
things actualh happen around
here enough to prove that Stan
lord students too can be .is laz\. ir
responsible, immoral, and un

couth as the next student.
