| usi how prestigious and in
fluential is the Stanford
women's volleyball program?
hnough so that when it needs
.1 new head coach, it can steal
awa\ one of the best coaches in
the nation from the program
that be built into a national
powerhouse.
John Dunning, who led the
University of the Pacific to two
national titles and 14 top-ten
finishes in bis Hi seasons with
the I'igers, has agreed to a
three-vear head coaching con
tract with the Cardinal. Dun
ning's signing was announced
by athletic director fed Leland
.it a press conference July 6.
"For me this is a fun hire." Le
land said. "I think John is a great
fit for Stanford because he
brings with him the shared val
ues of what sports at colleges and
universities should be about.
"He lias an appropriate em
phasis on the balance of acade
mics. athletics, and social growth."
Dunning won back-to-back
national titles with the I'igers in
and 198(i. his first twovears
at Pacific. All of bis teams made
the NC.AA tournament, and four

made the Final Four, most re
cently in 1999. l he l igers com
piled .111 impressive IW-14 record
in NCAA tournament pla\ under
Dunning's direction.
According to Dunning, leav
ing PaciFic was no easy decision.
He struggled at the press con
ference to describe tlic difficult\
of leaving for Stanford.
"I'm a loyal person," Dunning
said. "1 love the people I coach,
and I commit myself fully to
them. Making this decision this
quicklv was almost impossible.
"The thing keeping meat U()1'
was the great group that 1 liave
there that 1 had to call today. That
was a miserable experience."
Dunning takes over the
women's squad just two months
from the start of the 2001 sea
son. He will have to settle into
his new position quickly as Stan
ford faces two top-15 teams,
Penn State and Minnesota, din -
ing the first week of the season.
"1 think our team works well
with diversity and transition."
said junior outside hitter Ashley
Ivy, one of four starters return
ing to the Cardinal in the com
ing season. "This is probabh
one of the toughest schedules
Stanford has ever laced, l>ut I
don't think we'll be going into it
thinking we're rebuilding. We'll
be going in playing to win."
Dunning also announced
that assistant coaches Denise
Corlett and Kim Oden will re
main with the team.
Corlett served as interim
head coach last season while
Shaw was on sabbatical, and was
interviewed lor the head coach
ing job. Despite not being of
fered the position, Corlett will
remain at Stanford fora 13th
season, while Oden, a former
Stanford and national team
standout, returns for her sec
ond year on the Farm.
" The gii ls are onlv going to
have a little bit of time to get to
know me before the season
starts," Dunning said. " I hat's
why I felt it was so important
for Kim and Denise to stay, be
cause they can get me on board
and teach me things without
having me go around feeling in
the dark."
"My respect for Denise has
greatly grown," Ivy said. "She's
definitely shown a lot of respect

lor tlu* team, and she should
bring some sense of stabilit\ lo the
tram. It seemed like- things might
he coming unstable, but having
her here is definitely reassuring."
Stability is exactly what the
Cardinal needs, especially after
the trials it laced last season.
Stanford struggled to lind .1
consistent lineup to send to the
lloor in 2000 while a number ol
teams in the Pacific-10 confer
ence bad breakout seasons. I hat
combination led tlu- Cardinal to
its lowest ever conference finish
and final national rankings, at
No. I and 10 respectiveh
Dunning said he is prepared
to make the shift from the Big
West, where Pacific plavs its
conference games, to the Pac
-10, which could feature as mam
as four teams in the lop-10 pre
season poll.
"I he Pat -10 is a great confer
ence," Dunning said. " 1 lie Big
West has always bad three or
four ver\ good teams, but the
rest ol the conference lias bad
trouble competing, but top to
bottom the Pat -10 is the best
conference in the countn
Under Dunning, Pacific
dominated the big West this
past season, going 15-1 111
league plav. 1 he l igers finished

tlif year ranked No. 8 in the na
tion with a 28-4 record, making
it to the NCAA Regionals before
falling to No. 7 UCLA.
Pacific swept the ('.ardinal 3-0
on Nov. 7 in the two teams' only
meeting last season, 1 lie I igers
hadn't beaten the (Cardinal
siiu e 1900, one of only two loss
es Stanford suffered that year.
Despite Stanford's struggles
last season. Dunning is confi
dent that the Cardinal can re
turn to the top of the rankings.

Jenn Detmer and starting setter

can junior Logan loin, and

was widely considered to be the
top recruit in the nation.
"Almost all programs have
times when things happen,
where circumstances interfere
with a program trving to st.i\ at
the top, ,t> Stanford li.is done
for so long," Dunning said.
"We have great plavers com
