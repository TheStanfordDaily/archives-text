It's a reasonal)le case. Ol all

nounces he'll be retiring at the end of the vear. (In
deed, wait 'til next year — even retirement may not
take Cal off the team.)
Meanwhile, the analysts smirk, knowing that
players with better numbers will be selected as re

unswayed by sentimentality or subjectivity. And
Commissioner Bud Selig prepares a nice in-game
ceremony for the aging star, knowing that the fans
will want to see Cal honored one last time — even il
he is overshadowed by the new generation of stars.
Honored he was. When Cal stepped to the plate
