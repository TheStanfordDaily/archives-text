Mv stepfather doesn't like the All-Star
(ianie. He loves baseball, lie s an ar
dent Red Sox fan. He's watched,
played and coached the game his
whole lite. But in a team sport like baseball, he ar
gues, singling out indi\ idual players for particular

recognition is not onl\ mistaken
hut wrongheaded.
It's a reasonal)le case. Ol all
sports th.it hold s\\a\ over our na
tional consciousness, baseball per
haps puts ihc most emphasis on
teamwork, on the equalitv ol everv
position on the field. on getting the
win lor the team. What other sport
has a statistic lor sacrifices?

I could almost agree with him. Kxhibitions like
the Home Run Derby, the celebrit\ All-Star softball
game — these aren't baseball. So wliv have 'em?
I could almost agree. Kxcept for moments like
Tuesday night.
l he wonderful and unique thing about Major
League Baseball, among all pro sports, is that the
All-Star starting lineups are voted in In the fans.

I )a\c* Bam once said something along the lines of,
"Fans can continue to vote players in until they've
entirch losi their skills, or indeed are deceased. 1 he
American League starting lineup last year included
Luis riant, 1 lotius Wagner and Ronald Reagan."
1 Ins means that guys like Cal Ripken. Jr. are es
sentially guaranteed spots on the team. As a 20-year
veteran of the sport, perhaps the most popular
player of the last two decades, Cal can get himself
voted in despite a woeful .240 average and ongoing
back problems. Fans overlook those sorts of things
fora 19-time All-Star, particularly when he an
nounces he'll be retiring at the end of the vear. (In
deed, wait 'til next year — even retirement may not
take Cal off the team.)
Meanwhile, the analysts smirk, knowing that
players with better numbers will be selected as re
serves In the managers, men like |oe Forre,
unswayed by sentimentality or subjectivity. And
Commissioner Bud Selig prepares a nice in-game
ceremony for the aging star, knowing that the fans
will want to see Cal honored one last time — even il
he is overshadowed by the new generation of stars.
Honored he was. When Cal stepped to the plate
for the first time, the first batter in the bottom of


Jeff Cooper
i lie third, the tans that voted ( a I
in rose to their feet, cheering
until lit' stepped out of the hat
ter's box to raise his helmet and
thank them. I lie more jaded
newspaper men gave each other
winks, preparing for the in
evitable sharp grounder or
s\\ inging strikeout.
And then Cal stepped back
into the box, watched the
Dodgers' Chan Ho Park wind
lip, and took his first pitch over
the left-field wall.
IMent\ of people don't like
baseball. I'll ere are a million per
fect! \ valid, logical reasons not to
like the game. It's too long. It's
too slow. It's .ill about the money.
It's full of men of questionable
moral character who couldn't
care less about the lans who pay
their salary.
lint 1 defy anyone to watch

that moment and not get (hills
fiom the pure jo\ on ( al Ripken
Jr. s face as lie touched 'em all. "I
felt like I was living around the
bases. Ripken said. "1 felt fast for
the first time in im career."
Keep this in mind: (lie Haiti
more ()iioles slink. And remem
ber also: (!.il is not exact h hot
stlift on the fantas\ n ading block,
to put ii gentlv. On no scale ex
cept pure individual popularitx
is Ripken an All-Star.
And that's why, with all apolo
gies to m\ stepfather, the All-Star
game is worth having.
Not for its baseball worth. In
terleague plav and KSI'N have
made the noveltv of seeing stars
players from other teams trivial.
Back in the '70s. plavers took the
game seriouslv. hurling their
bodies around and brushing
each other back; that sort of com
petition is no more.
No, the reason for the All-Star
Came now is moments like Tues
day night and men like Cal. What
the All-Star Came does is show

«.isc win baseball is so beloved by
so main: its intimate grounding
in tradition and biston
All great cultural traditions
knowingh build on the shoul
ders of those that have gone be
fore. Baseball among all sports is
alone in the degree to which it
cherishes its heroes, reflects on
their plac ein hist on. and under
stands that its athletes don't just
practice their talents but indeed
live their li\es on the field.
IVrhaps, indeed, the All-Star
(lame is not as selfish as it seems
at first. Those who are selected
are chosen as individuals, in
deed. but the\ are made part of
the far larger team of past base
ball greats. B\ giving that team,
that community, its proper im
portance, the All-Star game em
bodies the essence of baseball.
