natch. I lie storyline, foi which Li is credited,
equally showcases the actor's storytelling inability.
I he plot ol "Kiss" follows an age-old I lollywood
formula. Li plays a Chinese government agent who
is framed fora crime he did not commit by a cor
rupt government official, the head of a drug and

Okav, not the most original

l or inov iegoei s with a strong
stomach toward violence, "Kiss

get Fonda. I'laving a prostitute

from North Dakota who works
for Karvo, Fonda is forced to

Aside from Fonda s perfor

the plot, Li's latest offering is a

Like the movie, Jet Li carries a comatose Bridget Fonda.
