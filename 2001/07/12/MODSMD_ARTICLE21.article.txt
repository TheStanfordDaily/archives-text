# Sugar Ray — about as real as a Southern Californian blonde

Listening to Sugar Kav's new
self-titled allium, it isn't hard to
imagine how or win am reviewer

hantl "good looks' and smooth
inarketahility of O-Town, com
bined with their hleathetl-lilonde
empt\ rock of American Hi-fi and
Doors Down, makes this hand
one that will remain on I Rl. and
the Billboard charts for some time.
And that's to say nothing ol
SoC.al surtt'i-bo\ Mark McGrath's
leatl vocals, which mimic the
smooth st \ lings of a lawn mower,
and Ivrics that most third-graders
would consider beneath them — "I
met a girl, she had another / But I
didn't know / The musi< was liella
bangin on the stereo / Litte later,

she said yes /
(irahlied me In
the hand, mui h
respect " What?
And, for the
generous inusu
lan thinking the
t horns can't l>c
am worse than
that — "She was
your woman,
but she was in\
girl/That would
make her ours."
hnough said.
If the band
took itself seri
ously, this laun
dry list might
matter. But who
writes lyrics like
these and means
for listeners to

hike tlieiti to heart? In making tlie
video tor "When Its( her." the first
single oil this album and arguably
its most heartfelt song, the band still
opts tor tongue-in-cheek humor.
As \l< ( iratli and company trv to
settle on .1 (oncept, the video lakes
the band 011 a hilarious 11111
through everything from 1980san
drogyny and voguing, to .1 strip
club, a quick visit with Kareem
Al)dul-|abbar. to finally — surprise
— the motorcycles and beaches
they finally identify as their look.
Despite what their l!>-year-old fans
might think, no one can act use the
bovs of Sugar Kav of having delu
sions of grandeur about the depth
of their music.
Ibis inherent goofiness makes
this album easy to listen to and fun
to sing. I he songs recall conversa
tions you thought were meaningful

until you decided to quit skipping
third and fourth period and expe
rieiu es that would have mattered if
vou were 30 and cared. I hat leaves
you old enough to laugh at the
angst of songs like "Sorry Now"
and its shouted lyrics "Why can't
you <all .mil sa\ you miss me?/The
time we waste just Ixvomes history
/ Who's soi rv now?" and too young

Don't I look cute in my pleather and fake blond hair?
wotds aren't jusi the oxeiblown
i hetoric ol adolescence.
It is a sweet deal, and one that
Mc(.ratl) s gravel-choked voice
sells easily. No real singer could
sing these songs with a straight
face, but Mcdrath's jokester
style and lack ol what might In
called any real talent make him
easx to relate to and like. Never

mind that his undeniable hot
ness and bad-boy attitude prob
ably sell more records and keep
more women listening than any
thing else.
I his is not an album for pure
rot k lans. but il you are driving
with the top down antl the music
tip and you are at peace with the
Calilornian inside vou, it is the
perfect set of sillx summer songs.
You will chuckle at some ol the
lyrics, belt out every chorus and.
when it's over, be happy enough
to let it play again.
