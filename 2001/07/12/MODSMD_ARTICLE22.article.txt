# Leaving you with your head in the clouds
## 
### CAROLINE SAKAMOTO STAFF WRITER 
Long before it was fashionable to write dramas or come
dies with gay themes, there was British playwright Caryl
Churchill. It's little wonder that so main writers point to her
as a direct influence. I lie bra/en risk-taking in her plays is
the ancestor of the boundary-pushing in "Queer .is Folk."
"Will and C.race," "Jeffrey," "Angels in America,""In and
Out " and many other facets of queer performance. But un
like most ancestors, this one is alive and kicking. A recent

production of
Churchill's "Cloud 9"
at the New Conserva
tory Theater in San
Francisco proves that
her work is as shock
ing, impressive and
touching as it was back
in the 19705.
"Cloud 9" is decid
edly a farce, and it can

be a hit much to handle, but tlit* experience is worth it. ('.live
( 1 re ( orbed) is a British colonist in Africa, struggling to keep
the natives in order while keeping wat< h over his familx I lis
wile, Betty, is played b\ ,1 man (Kenny Shult/). Being the
ideal family, of course, they have two kids: Kdward (played by
a woman, the loveh Megan lowle) and \ it k\ (played b\ a
doll). W'ackiness ensues, and this existent e atop "C.loiul 9" is
disrupted only when two free spirits arrive. 1 hey are Mrs.
Saunders (Tiffany Hoover), something of a Victorian domi
natrix — whip and all — thinly disguised as a divorcee wear
ing a riding habit, and Ifarry (Jell Larson), a friend o! (Hive
and the stereotypical manly explorer tvpe. Also in the picture
are a mousy governess and a black servant, played by a white
man (John Michael Beck).
In no particular order, the events that unfold in the first
act include a lesbian coming-out, two counts of adultery, pe
dophilia, the wedding of a bisexual man to the lesbian,
voyeurism and Mrs. Saunders whacking evervone with her
whip. These theatrics are meant to tear down all of our pre
conceived notions about roles by taking the idea of an "alter
native lifestyle" to its logical extreme.
I lie second act fast-forwards 100 years to Britain in the

19K0s, but the characters only age about 25 years. Vicky (now
played In a person. I owle) is unhappily m.irried with an un
seen son. She begins .1 lesbian allair with Lin, a manly woman
with .1 daughter, played In Beck, the onl\ .111 of c ross-dress
ing in the second .h t. Kdward (C.orbett) is well and complete
ly out ol the closet and trying to find himself'within the urn
text ol ,1 complicated relationship with .1111.111 from N'orthei 11
Ireland (Sliult/).
Standouts in the (.isi include Sliult/ and l owle. for some
reason, ( linn bill chose to have Cerrv, the Irish man. deliv
er monologues alone on stage. I be\ stand in sharp contrast
to the melee ol action in both acts. Sliult/ handles them vet)
well; it's hard to believe this was the same gin who was
dressed up 111 ,1 ruffly pink gown and curly brown wig 15
minutes ago. I owle is wonderfully exuberant .is Kdward and
completely believable as a little boy. As Victoria, she easily
moves from prudish, proper wife to liberated lesbian teasing
her husband to join an orgy seance.
Beck, as |oshua the slave, flubbed a song but got the
African accent down quite nicely . Corbett's differentiation
of Kdward and ( live was excellent, with the bombastic,
testosterone-laden ( live winking at the audicm e during his
affected lines and Kdward cowering in fear of bis
boyfriend s rejection. Hoover was a hoot to watch as Mrs.
Saunders.
I laving read the text, I noticed that many lines 111 the play
that could have easily been read with apathy were instead 1 00
percent milked lor their humor potential. It worked well,
.ind drew tons of laughs.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment ol ibis plav is that,
after several weeks in production, the actors still forgot
lines. I bis is the kind ol tiling that w ill prevent this theater
company from appealing to the masses like the Americ an
Conservatory 1 beat re. or even I heatreWorks. With a lit
tle disc ipline and maybe some cracks of Mrs. Saunders'
whip, this company can expand its reputation. I lie ambi
tion is clearly there 011 a given night: I liree different plays
are running simultaneously 111 three tun theatres 111 the
same building. 1 lie talent and directing ability are there as
well — this production of "("loud 9" is one that stavs with
you.
"Cloud 9" has now closed, but the Pride Season at New
Conservatory continues in |ulv with Paul Rudni( k's "The
Most Fabulous Story Ever fold."
