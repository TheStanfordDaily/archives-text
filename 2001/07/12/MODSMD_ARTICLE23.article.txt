louchstone Pictures aimed to paint a unique
portrait ol .1 cross-cultural, class-divided rela
tionship in .1 "provocative and sew teen drama,"
"( 1 a/\ Beautiful" ends up less than satisfactory.
I lie film's luisic plot line is the dichotomy and
love stor\ iK'tween an emotionallv troubled teen
girl named Ni(ole()akle\ (Kirsten l)unst)anda
handsome Litino (larlos Nunez (Jay Ilernan
de/.). While die movie hints at greater concepts
like rat ism and the clash between lamily expec
tations and personal goals, it finis to develop
them fnllv and instead content rales on cliche rt»-
mantii scenes Ix'tween two teenagers. I nfortu
nateK. the long physical s( enes are the type that
might excite \<»n if von area repressed 1

While the movie seis the stage for potential
l\ interesting conflicts within the relationship,
the film as a whole is nnlullilling. Instead of ex
