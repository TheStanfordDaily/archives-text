louchstone Pictures aimed to paint a unique

"( 1 a/\ Beautiful" ends up less than satisfactory.
I lie film's luisic plot line is the dichotomy and

girl named Ni(ole()akle\ (Kirsten l)unst)anda
handsome Litino (larlos Nunez (Jay Ilernan

PLAYING EVERYWHERE
I— _J
point Nicole attends a partv .it
(.al ios' home. In a completely dil
ferent ( ultural atmosphere where
('..trios' conservative mother gives
het disapproving glances, Nicole
leels completely awkward. How
ever, the difficulties of meshing
two dillerent nltnres is never dis
( nssed In the couple, and it seems
that .is long as the\ can hook up
every once in a while, .ill their
problems can he resolved.
1 he same inadequate presenta

tion tomes through loi the socioe
conomic conflict existing between
the couple. Carlos must put lorth
incredible ellort toward an educa
tion th.it will make his mot bet's sac -
rifices (or him worthwhile while
also working weekends at his
line le's shop. Nicole, on the othei
hand, skips classes to drink booze
and c barters private planes lor )o\
rides. Again, thee harac ters address
this difference in I i lest vie only
briefly.
What the movie locuses on in
stead is hem a first love can patch
lip a damaged heart. Nicole's emo
tional issues seem to be the c rn\ ol
the movie, but even these are

pushed aside in liivorol < heesx dia
logue and overused s< enes.
II there is one redeeming aspet I
of the movie, it mav he the some
what tealistit portrax.il ol patent
child relationships. Nicole's strug
gle with her lather can resonate
with audience nicinl>ers who have
had similat experience with then
parents or i hildren, and (.arlos' re
lationship with his mother will
prohahh seem strikingly lainili.tr to
mam movie goers.
In sum, this movie max l>e hctter
suited fora xounger brother or sis
ter, but even they max have prob
lems with the latk ol depth and
oversimplified solutions.
