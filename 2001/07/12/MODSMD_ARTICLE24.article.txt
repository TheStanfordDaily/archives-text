### EREZ YOELI EDITORIAL STAFF 
11' you are looking to test your music acumen, you just
might be interested in this album. Ministn has been
breaking aural barriers lor longer than most ol us < .111 re
member, and "Greatest hits," a collection ol 13 vears of
angn industrial mixed with metal, is their idea <>l .1 great
est hits album. It provides a fascinating glimpse into the
history of modern metal, as the songs on this compilation
have been weeded through and harvested b\ some ol
loda\ s hottest artists 111 various genres.
I nlortunateb, it takes more than a lac kof reverarue
to make music. II vou're not in the mood lor historx and
vou're looking to be moved, look elsewhere. "Greatest
Kits" is a product oI good advertising, not great music.
With the album, Ministrv is siinpb tiding the coat-tails ol
the movie "A.1.," in which the song "Wh.it About Is —
the first track in "Greatest l its." is featured.
Despite this apparent failure, the band deserves some

credit. Some of I lie
tracks are somewhat
cool and may have
been ahead of their
time at their release.
"Jesus Uuili My
Hotrod," the song
for which the band is
best known, is a fast-

paced, adrenalin-lilled sprint which doesn't
let down lor a moment. "So What (live)" and
"N.W.0," (racks live and m\ on the album,
hot h lea lire an ontsiatiding mixing ol uncon
ventional sounds. Ministrv's cover ol Bob
Dvlan's "Lay Lad\ Lay may he the best song
in "Greatest Fits' ot it ma\ be the svstematii
destruction ola classic tune, depending on
your taste. Don't he surprised il'vou heart lips
from any ol these songs sampled and well-re
ceived in some late-night club. In sin.ill quan
tities, Ministry isn't hall bad.
I lit- kr\. however, is small quantities. Min
istry's raucous wall ol electronics and distor
tion gets old quickly, far more quit kl\ than
,ui\ ol the songs on ibis album end. I nlortu
natelv, the band lacks an\ coiK'ept ol dvnain
i( sand varietv: I licit music is consistently
dark, furious and rcall\ loud. 1 heir l\ rit s are
mean and depressing, and their rhythms are
largelv unadventurous. Limp Ki/kil wouldn't
be (aught dead playing to the beats found in
"Greatest 112 its." Ministry may not lack charac
ter, but they lack the charisma and mar
ketability necessary to attract a wider audi
ence.

II you want to know where Rammstein
stole their famous guitar Ink for "l)u I laas" or where Rob
/ombie got his inspiration for the "Mission Impossible"

soundtrack, pit kup "Greatest 1-its" and skip to tracks
seven and eight. Otherwise, hold on to your dough —
Ranunstein and Zombie are better investments.
