## Kyoto 2001: Is it hot on this planet or is it just me?

I lit' lights g(> out and your air condi
tioner, television and Sonv Playstation are
rendered inoperable. You have just been
hit In a rolling blackout.
As blackouts become a real threat, energx
consumption is on the minds of mam Cali
fornians. In recent months, it has been a
point to ponder for President Bush as well.
Partly becauseofthecontinuingeneig\
shortage. Hush is opposed to the Kvoto
Protocol, .111 inlet national plan to reduce
emissions of < arbon-based gases. I lie pro
tocol promises to give a break to hard
working powet plants in California and
throughout the world.
"We are in an energy crisis." Bush said
in March. "1 will not accept a plan that
will harm our econoim and hurt Ameri
can workers."
In his tour ol Europe last month. Bush
reaffirmed his opposition to the 1997 cli
mate pad. to the dismay of mam Ameri
(ans and Europeans.
In December 1997, representatives
Irom S() nations signed the Kvoto Protocol
ai a I nited Nations meeting in New York.
President ('.linton signed it at a later meet
ing in Buenos Aires.
I lie agreement outlines a plan to re
duce worldwide emissions ol carbon
based gases b\ an average of 5.2 percent
below 1990 levels In 2012. Each countr\
set its own goal.
For example, the United States
pledged a seven percent decrease, the
European Union nations eight percent,
Japan to six percent and Russia and the
Ukraine pledged to simply maintain
1990 levels.
According to many scientists, reducing
worldwide emissions of carbon-based
gases should slow global warming. How
ever, some industrialists argue that it is
still unclear whether or not these gases are
produc ing long-term c limate < hanges.
But just last month, researc hers at Lon
don's Imperial College provided perhaps
the lust definitive scientific prool linking
greenhouse gases to global warming.

fhey compared satellite images from
1970 and 1997 and discovered that less in
frared radiation is esc aping from the earth
because ol an increase in atmosheric
greenhouse gases.
At the c urrent rate ol global warming,
air temperatures could rise In ! to 3.5 de
grees Celsius and the average sea level
could rise b\ 15 to 95 cm In 2100.

stated that
the U.S. en

is "construc t
ing power
plants at an
iinpi e < e -
(Ie nt e d
pace," so the
( one cutra-

lion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
is likely to increase.
B\ some estimates, over the last 200
vears, the concentration of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere lias increased b\ 30
percent. I'rees and other plants convert
the gas to ox\ gen. bin deforestation is hin
dering this natural countermeasure.
I'he I .S. produces 25 percent of the
world's carbon dioxide. Proponents ol the
kvoto Protocol point out that Americans
comprise onl\ 5 peri cut ol the world's pop
ulation, so these emissions levels are dis
proportionatch high, but opponents of the
agreement point out that 1 .S. emissions
levels roughl\ match America's proportion
of the world's econoim.
In an\ case, the White I louse is against
the international protocol that aims to re

duce the emission ol carbon-based gases
to slow long term climate (hange.
In Marc h, White I louse spokesman At i
Eleisc her argued that the (lunate pac I had
little support at home and abroad.
"Civen the fact ili.it it was voted 95-0
against in the I N Senate, it's a < lear sign
that there is little support, il any," he said.
Before the Iwoto Protocol was signed,
i lie Senate

passed a reso
lution that

"Wh en

the treats into effect has ac ted, it's a signal
worldwide that others agree with the
President's position on the treaty," Fleis
cher said.
I o date, not a single European I nion
nation has ratified the Kvoto Protocol.
I n response to Bush and Eleisc her s com
ments, Europeans nil kuamed the president
"The Foxic Fexan" and supporters of the
protocol issued strong statements.
British Environment Minister Michael
Meac her joined the debate, pointing out that
Bush's stance on the issue is not only envi
ronmentallx unsound, but also has serious
political implications.
"| I he protocol| was signed In every sin
gle nation on earth and if America now
tries to walk away . .. this is not just an en
vironmental issue, it's an issue of transat

la lit it global foreign polio," Meachcr said.
l uo weeks ago, the While Mouse soft

mate pact.
"We didn't feel like the Kyoto I realv
u.is well-balanced," President Rush
said | une 18 at a conference in Sweden.
"It didn't include developing nations.
Ihe goals were not realistic. 1 lowever,
th.it doesn't mean we cannot continue
to work together on reducing green
house gases."
Stanford Kiologx l'rof. Steve Schnei
der was a certified member of a non
governmental organi/ation during the
drafting of the k\oto Protocol, which al
lowed him to partic ipale in press con
lereiu es .iiid sessions.
lie staled that the protocol is based on
three principles: international action is
needed to solve the problem, rich nations
are in a hetlei position to solve the prob
lem and solutions must be cost-effective
and have built in lle\ibilit\ mechanisms.
Schneider said that he was "dumb
founded" l>\ Hush's response, which he
said was "arrogant
Pedro (iutierre/, a doctoral student in
biology, had a different view on the White
I louse's i espouse to the Kvoto Protocol.
"It could he a sign of pi udence on then
part." (iutierre/ said. "It would be unfair
to make the energ\ necessities of liuopc
the same as the Tinted Slates because of
demographies and the infrastructure ol
oni six iet\. It would be unfair to compare
the two and hold us to the same standard."
Stanford Law Professor loin Heller is
on the I \ Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change. He believes that the
structure of the k\oto Protocol could be
improved.
"I think there are opportunities to in
volve developing countries ... I don't at
t.u Ii .is imii Ii important e to the particular
time tables that the protocol commits itself
too," Heller said. "II the Bush administra
tion is taking positive steps towards im
provements, then I think their position is
reasonable. If they're not seriously consid
ering alternatives to manage climate
(liange, then I think they're irresponsible."

Has Bush not warmed up to the idea of global warming?
