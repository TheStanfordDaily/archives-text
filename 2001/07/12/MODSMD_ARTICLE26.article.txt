### SARAH MEARON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Having spent four days in Sin City last
week, I thought n appropriate to make the
fabled town the theme of the first edition of

compatible with the human body, making it
among the most versatile materials used in
medical applications today.

In the words of Trent, the shameless
man-slut in "Swingers," "Baby, you are so

Vegas is money. And it knows it. From the
