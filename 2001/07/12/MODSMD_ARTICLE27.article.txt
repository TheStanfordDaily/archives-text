In her book, "Preventing the Harmful

Peplau warns that the longer people are
situationallx lonely, the more thex begin to
attribute their loneliness to internal fac

thoughts. "N'obodx wants to be with me
because I am a bad person" would be an
example. I his is in contrast to external ex

Researchers Sherri Oden and Siexen

Asherof the University of Rochester claim
that the ke\ to successful treatment of
loneliness is through therapy using the
(lieni-therapist relationship as a model for
other relationships.
Unfortunately, most people do not seek
professional help for loneliness. Instead,
our society has evolved aso-called "loneli
ness industry to cater to the needs ol peo
ple who are lonely, l he industry includes
businesses like dating services, singles or
ganizations. bars, nightclubs and personals
in the newspaper.
Kxamples ol the on-campus ana
logues ol the loneliness iudustrv are fra
ternities and sororities, student groups
and the (olio Moonbeans scene. While
these groups can be helpful, some col
lege students seem to have found their
preferred method ol coping with loneli
ness to be alcohol.
Perhaps .1 reason students resort to al
cohol is that social behavior has been
shown to be surprisingly ineffective in
dealing with loneliness. I hat is not to sa\
that sot i.il support isn't \ital to improve
ment, since the result of social support is
.in improvement in sell-esteem.
1 lie goal ol social interat lion should be
lo altei maladaptive thoughts in explain
ing the causes ol behavior. According to
Peplau, the more you (an attribute behav
ior to situation.il factors instead of nega
tive personalis characteristics, the less
lonely vou will be.
I hits, simply being a member of a social
club or going to <1 fraternity party is not
going to make vou less loneh. But if sour
sot ial acti\ it it's make vou feel better about
vourselfor more meaningfully connected
to others, those activities will be helpful in
i oping with loneliness.
In an> case, de I ocqueville had a good
point. Democracy can be psychologically
very hard on its < iti/ens. Mark I wain had
a different take on loneliness. He wrote,
"be good and vou will be lonesome."
Don't be too good!
