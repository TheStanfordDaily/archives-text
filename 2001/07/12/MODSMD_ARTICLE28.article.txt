Speed, thrill and power. Solai power?
On |nK 15. members ol'the Solai C'.ar Pro
ject will begin t<» experience all these sen
sations as the\ race from Chicago to l.os
\ngeles in the American Solar (lhallenge.
I he 2300 mile race is the largest ol its
kind in the world. 1 his year, ."> teams
are participating in the event. Most ol
them are from Tinted States universi
ties, but there are some international
representatives as well.
Stanford is participating with two cars,
the first time in the challenge's history
that any group has done so. The newer
"Third Degree Burnet" car is racing in
the Stock category, which limits teams to
spending ten dollars per watt of power on
building the solar array and requires use
of lead-acid batteries to power the vehicle.
1 lie older "Back Burner" is racing in the
Open category, which has no such limits.
Alan Amaya, a junior in electrical engi
neering, explained that Stanford's best
chances lie with the I 'bird Degree Burner
in the Stock category. Because of the
power and cost limitations placed on cars

Stanford's strateg\ is to rel\ on team
work. "The psychological preparation is

During the race, two chase vehicles op
erated bv the crew and the organization
will accompanv eat h participant to ensure
its safety. In the case of a problem, the
chase vehicles will stop and the crew will
come out to fix the solar vehicle.
"We have built mathematical models of
the car — polynomial descriptions of the
car, battery, solar arra\. etc.," said Klov
Avila, a junior majoring in electrical engi
neering and a crew member for the I bird
Degree Burner. "Based on these |models),
we can constanth determine the optimal
speed (for the vehicle]."
Avila predicted the lieginning of the rate
would be slow Ixrause it starts in a mosth
urban area. I lowever, he was confident that
the Stanford team has a good chance to'Yer
tainlv complete [the rat e in] the first three."
Building a Solar Car
As exciting as the rat e sounds, students
said tli.it it required patience and hard

work to build .i solar-powered vehicle.
I larnassing solar energy requires the use
ol photovoltaic tells, which are made out of
two kinds of silicon, p-tvpeand n-t\ pe silicon.
A pure pin e ol silicon has an equal iiuiulh-i
of positive and negative charges within it.
(Mien, impurities are intention.ill\ added to
the silicon to (reate excess positiveh or nega
tively charged paitit les in the material.
I Ins prot ess is t ailed doping and is ke\
to producing most semiconductor de
vices, like transistors, diodes and, of
course, solar cells. I he si 1 it on is < ailed p
tvpe when it is doped positively and n
t\ pe when it is doped negativel\.
W hen a piece of p-tvpe and a piece of n
tvpe silicon are brought together, a p-n
junction is formed — this is a photovoltaic
or solar cell. When sunlight strikes the solar
t ell. electrons in the p-n junction are excit
ed and migrate from the p-silicon to the n
silicon. producing a current that charges
the batteries and powers the motor.
1 he hallmark of solar energy is its en
vironmental friendliness; no fossil fuel
burning means no pollution. Solar cars
like those in the race demonstrate the
tet hnologv is feasible but still expensive.
I be Stanford cat, for instant e, look two
vears, a total of 40 hours of work per

Get out of my dreams... get into my solar car.
Speed, thrill and power. Solai power?
On |nK 15. members ol'the Solai C'.ar Pro
ject will begin t<» experience all these sen
sations as the\ race from Chicago to l.os
\ngeles in the American Solar (lhallenge.
I he 2300 mile race is the largest ol its
kind in the world. 1 his year, ."> teams
are participating in the event. Most ol
them are from Tinted States universi
ties, but there are some international
representatives as well.
Stanford is participating with two cars,
the first time in the challenge's history
that any group has done so. The newer
"Third Degree Burnet" car is racing in
the Stock category, which limits teams to
spending ten dollars per watt of power on
building the solar array and requires use
of lead-acid batteries to power the vehicle.
1 lie older "Back Burner" is racing in the
Open category, which has no such limits.
Alan Amaya, a junior in electrical engi
neering, explained that Stanford's best
chances lie with the I 'bird Degree Burner
in the Stock category. Because of the
power and cost limitations placed on cars

in the Stoi k (ategon. more planning is re
quired to come up with a winning strate

is an old car with outdated tet hnolog\.
"Oui main competition is the Massachu

During the race, two chase vehicles op
erated bv the crew and the organization
will accompanv eat h participant to ensure
its safety. In the case of a problem, the
chase vehicles will stop and the crew will
come out to fix the solar vehicle.
"We have built mathematical models of
the car — polynomial descriptions of the
car, battery, solar arra\. etc.," said Klov
Avila, a junior majoring in electrical engi
neering and a crew member for the I bird
Degree Burner. "Based on these |models),
we can constanth determine the optimal
speed (for the vehicle]."
Avila predicted the lieginning of the rate
would be slow Ixrause it starts in a mosth
urban area. I lowever, he was confident that
the Stanford team has a good chance to'Yer

Building a Solar Car
As exciting as the rat e sounds, students
said tli.it it required patience and hard

work to build .i solar-powered vehicle.
I larnassing solar energy requires the use
ol photovoltaic tells, which are made out of
two kinds of silicon, p-tvpeand n-t\ pe silicon.
A pure pin e ol silicon has an equal iiuiulh-i
of positive and negative charges within it.
(Mien, impurities are intention.ill\ added to
the silicon to (reate excess positiveh or nega
tively charged paitit les in the material.
I Ins prot ess is t ailed doping and is ke\
to producing most semiconductor de
vices, like transistors, diodes and, of
course, solar cells. I he si 1 it on is < ailed p
tvpe when it is doped positively and n
t\ pe when it is doped negativel\.
W hen a piece of p-tvpe and a piece of n
tvpe silicon are brought together, a p-n
junction is formed — this is a photovoltaic
or solar cell. When sunlight strikes the solar
t ell. electrons in the p-n junction are excit
ed and migrate from the p-silicon to the n
silicon. producing a current that charges
the batteries and powers the motor.
1 he hallmark of solar energy is its en
vironmental friendliness; no fossil fuel
burning means no pollution. Solar cars
like those in the race demonstrate the
tet hnologv is feasible but still expensive.
