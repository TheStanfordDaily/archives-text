An article in the July (> issue ol Sci
ence highlights new findings on the po
tential dangers involved in reprodiu tive
cloning. Ii has long been thought that
clones — even those that appear normal
— could have problems with gene ex
pression lor characteristics that are not
easily observable.
While investigating the poor viability
and rapid growth ol cloned animals, re
searchers found the first piece of evidence
to support this In pothesis. I he\ used em
brvonic stem cells to tlone mice and then
observed what happened to imprinted
genes — genes that are marked with tags
that turn the gene "on" or "oil" without
changing the base sequence ol the DN.V
Somewhere in the process, these tags were
being lost. Researchers wanted to see if
the tags were being reproduced consis
tent in both the clone cells and the
donor cells in order to determine if the
problem resided with the donor cells or
with the cloning method.
Scientists found that the donoi tells
were extremeh hard to c ulture and that
the problem was with the donor tells and
not with the method of c loning. I he donor

cells lost the tags while replicating, wliicli
tampered with the intended gene ex
pression designed for the stabili
ty of the mite. However, this
did not prevent the em-

bryos from maturin
and many of them
reached adulthood.
