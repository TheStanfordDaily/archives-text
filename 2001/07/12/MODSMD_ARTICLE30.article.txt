# Researcher investigates role of telomeres in cancer prevention

### CHARLES FENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Telomeres first gained worldwide attention while some am
bitious s( ientists were spending their time counting sheep. More
specifically telomeres were piri|K)inted as a possible explanation
lor win l)o!l\, the lamous sheep clone, appeared phvsicalh
older than her voung age otherwise might have indie ated.
Whether or not telomeres are responsible lor the aging
process in hum.ms remains to be determined. However, this
fact is certain: I eloniercs pla\ an integral role in the lot ination

Telomeres are the DNA end-(.ips ol i hroniosonies. Altei

Steven Artandi, an assistant prolessot ol medicine in the
bematologx department at Stanford, is the head <>l .1 researc li
group that is investigating the relationship I >etween telomeres
and cancer.
"I got interested in cancer because during nn medical ti .1111

cancers from developing. However, the en/vine telomerase.

Artandi has developed miee lines that lae k the abilih i«» e x

telomeres. I lowcvei, when Artandi developed inu e that lae keel
both the telomerase and p.">!? genes, the mice were still highh
cancer-prone, even though telomerase was not present.
" I Ins is countci intuitive to what we learned bclore," Artan

Although Artan

humans as well.
