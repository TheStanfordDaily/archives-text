## Ellison's $150 million still up for grabs 
### SCOTT DORFMAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Soft wart* mogul Larry Kllison
lias a vision fora Sl5O million in
stitute to stiul\ tlit* effects of tech
nology on politics and econom
ics. Ilie Redwood Citv-based
philanthropist's vision max or
max not involve Stanford.
Kllison, the billionaire chief
executive officer of Oracle Cor
poration, has recently made
overtures to both Stanford and
Harvard University about estab
lishing the institute. I le is expect
ed to announce the location with
in the next few months.
I he gift would be one of the
top do/en ever given to an indi
vidual United St.ites university,
according to I he Chronicle of
I Uglier Kducation.
Kllison has done little to indi
cate which university he is favor
ing, although he has narrowed
down his list to only Stanford and
Ilarvard.
"It's one or the other," Kllison
told The Wall Street Journal.
"There are very few schools
that have good schools of engi
neering, good schools of eco
nomics and good schools of polit
ical science."
While both schools are down
play ing the competitive aspect of
Kllison's offer, representatives of
Stanford have spoken publicly
about the University's qualifica
tions for hosting the institute.
"If what Mr. Kllison really
wants to do is share what the in
gredients are to making so main
successful technology (ompanies,
all he has to do is think about Sil
icon Valley and the role Stanford

has played in its development,"
John Ford, Stanford's vice presi
dent of development, told I lie
Boston Globe. "Obviously, 1
would love to see this based here
on the West Coast. I here's also a
lot of personal advantage, be
cause he can obviously be in
volved from da\ one."
Stanford faculh agreed with
Ford's analysis of the I niversity.
"Stanford must have the best
combination of engineering, eto
noniics and political science in
the world," said John Shown, the
(lliarles Schwab Professor of K( o
nomics and senior fellow .it the
Center for Kconomic Policy Re
search. "My impression is that
Larry Kllison is interested in
spreading an understanding of
what you might (all the Silicon
Vallev phenomenon to other
parts of the world. 1 he combina
tion of a strong legal system, a

competitive economy, a de
mocratic society, the best sys
tem of higher education in
the world [and other factors]
are all contributors. Stanford
is a kr\ element of Silicon
\ alley . Where better to stud\
and learn about it?"
Harvard officials also dis
cussed the University's assets for
housing Kllison's institute.
"The depth of Harvard's
faculty and its research pro
grams has such an incredible
range that the issues go be
yond engineering, and in
clude law, business, govern
ment, and science, both basic
and applied," Andy I iede
mann, Harvard's director of
(level op in en t com m un i c a -
lions, told I he Globe. "All of
those areas are strengths of
Harvard's and could be
brought to bear in looking

into the effect ol technology
on societ\
I lie ()rac It' head lias been in
cont.u i with Stanford officials lor
about a vear and Stanford lias al
read\ submitted a proposal for
the insitute, according to I "ho
Chronicle. Harvard lias not yet
submitted a concrete proposal.
Ellison's method of fostering
competition between universities
over the gift is rclativeb rare in
(lie liistoix ol higher education.
Last \ear, the Massachusetts In
stitute ol fechnologv received a
million gilt establishing .111
institute loi the study ol the
hum.lll brain. Six other universi
ties had made proposals to the
donor. International I)ata(>roup
founder Patrick |. McCovern |r.
both Shoven .ind outside ob
servers said that Ellison was
being prudent in maintaining
contact with both Harvard and
Stanford about the institute.
"1 guess I view this as Lun Kl
lison doing a due dilegence re
garding whether he is lo< ating the
program in the best locale,"
Shoven said. "I am confident that
Stanford is actualb the best place
fbr stu li a program and hope that
he will reach the same com lusion."
" I his stvle of philanthropy is
becoming increasingb popular
with large universit\ donors,"
Stacv Palmer, editor of the
Chronicle of Philanthropy, told
I he (ilobe. "Fora lot of these
philanthropists —and most of
them are high-tech moguls —
it's not about personal ties to the
institution; it's about getting
something done. I hf\ just want
the best organization to do it."
It is not exacth clear about the

"something" that t'.llison wants to
get done. Although details re
garding the goals and fix us of t he
institute remain sketchy. Ford
said that Kllison is interested in
bringing in international stu
dents to learn about the Ameri
can economy. According to the
Associated Press, "Kllison envi
sions an interdisciplinary center
he calls I'F.T, for politics, eco
nomics and technology."
rhe institute would be the sec -
ond largest gift in the Stanford
history, following the $100 mil
lion donation from the Hewlett
Foundation to the Si hool of Hu
manities and Sciences and Cam
paign for I Udei graduate Fduca
tion last May. Kllison's gilt would
be the largest in I larvard history,
more than doubling the $70.5
million gift from |ohn and Fran
c is Lehman Loeb in 1995.
While Stanford faculty are ex
cited about the prospect of Klli
son's gift. the\ are not jumping to
any conclusions.
"1 think faculty would he excited if
the gilt were Ixlter defined and were
dose to a reality, Shoven said. "We
leel that we are yen strong in 112x >litical
econoomy, but we would love to lx
even stronger. Still, I think most facul
l\ an* taking a wait and see attitude.
I he\ sinipK don't know the details or
the pliabilities. None of lis do, lx'-
cause the details have not been
worked out."
Ford said he is optimistic
about Stanford's ( bailees in get
ting the institution, but admits
that the outcome is uncertain.
"It appears we're in a healthy
competition," Ford said. "But
onl\ I.arr\ Kllison knows what
Karr\ Kllison is going to do."
