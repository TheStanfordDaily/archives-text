### SANDRA UPSON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford I niversity plans to
build smaller, more affordable
housing fbrmemlKTsot the faculty.
I lie proposed sites for the new
housing units include an area near
the Stanford Ciolf'Course as well a
smaller area oil Stanford Avenue.
Hie new units will alleviate the
housing crunch for faculty mem
bers, as well as provide more af
fordable housing options for
vounger and older memlxTs of the
faculty.

Though the project is still in its
planning stages, some innovative
plans have been considered to opti
mize const UK lion of the new hous
ing units. ()ne idea is to provide in
tergeneration.il housing, targeting
retired faculty as well as more ju
nior faculty members w ho may not
lx- able to aff(ml market prit e hous
ing in the Palo Alto area.
"The plan is to accommodate
anywhere from three to six bun
died people, and we have yet to de
fine the types of housing we're
going !o design," I niversit\ Archi
tect David Neuman said. "Inter
generational housing is one idea.

"The senior faculty is certainly
concerned that the I niversitv is
building more homes, but the need
is not net essarik (or more buildings
but (or more affordable housing
options." Wexler said." I liev would

Hie faculty housing is being
built in accordance with the Gener

According to Jones, the new
units would end up as intergenera

older faculty members who m.i\

The two sites are currenth
being evaluated from practical
