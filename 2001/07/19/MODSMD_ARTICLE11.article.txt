Stanford, among twentv
eight other ii.iiion.il private
universities, is adopting .1 new
polio emphasizing need-based
iinanci:il aid.
In an ellort to provide stu
dents in need of financial aid
with increased econonii< assis
tance, Stanford is revising its
polio to make financial need
the top priority in granting aid.
I he new program does not
decrease the amount of finan
cial aid distributed among stu
dents; rather, it restructures the
system to issue funds with an
emphasis soleK on need rather
than on both need and merit.
"What it does is tie us to
other institutions so that when
students are choosing between
Stanford and another school,
we can be fairh certain that a fi
nancial aid oiler will not be the
driving force in their decision,"
Robin Mamlet, dean of admis
sions and financial aid. said in
an article in the San I i .iik isco
C '.hronicle.
"It sounds like the restruc
turing will benefit those who

need money more th.in n lias in
the past, bill n depends on how
the pi.tn is implemented,"
sophomore kwadwo Olosn-
Barko said.
fhe plan is centered on the
decision to make economical
need the primary factor in de
ciding w ho receives aid. All par
ticipating schools have agreed
to list' common terminology in
.m effort to assist prospective
students when comparing
schools .ind their proposals.
