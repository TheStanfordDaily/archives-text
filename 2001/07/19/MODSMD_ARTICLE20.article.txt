I lie album has the same strut

works, "112 lecti n " and "Sonic

their more got hie punk roots. It

has a heavier sound than the

"beyond Good and Kvil" is
IvricalK simple. I lie words do
not make 100 mut It senseoll their
own. but ihe\ serve the inusit
well. ()ne weltonie t liange in the
album is the omission of the Na

themes appropriated e.irb on in

it distracts from the music.
I lie high point ol the album is
its first single, "Rise." I he song is

(ailt's alreach large collection of
great arena-rot king songs. I here
are only a couple of clunkers,

an .ittempt to update the power
ballad, u I lit li is beginning to look
as if it is — thankfully — not up
dateahle. However, even "Nico,"
displays a good hit ol i reative cf-
Ibrt and does not manage to drag
the rest of the C.l) down with it.

venient mid-point that can please
most people at mixed-genre
gatherings, "lieyontl Good and
Kvil" will probably not be as suc
cessful in this genre-crossing role
for younger rock fans, but it
should give 1 is aging punks, alter
native kids and metalheads
something to agree on.
