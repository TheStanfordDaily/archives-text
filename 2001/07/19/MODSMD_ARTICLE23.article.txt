fates ol the same coin: ex.itt Inu

It took two vears and 5177 mil
lion to measure these dillerences
with high enough precision.
Implications
flic implications of this phe
nomenon are shattering. First, it
suggests the universe is lopsided. It

also could require a revision ol
what is known as the Standard
Model.
1 he Standard Model is the set
of theories that explains how all
fundamental particles interact.
Dr. |onathan Dorian, director
of SL\(explained the dilemma.
According to the model, "the
Big Bang produced equal
amounts of matter and anti-mat
ter," Dorian s.iid. "How then did
we evolve a I niversewhit h is dom
inated In matter and in fact (<>n
tains no discernible stable anti
matter?"
Dorian explained the current
thcorv, lit si proposed b\ the Russ
ian pin sit Ist Andrei Sakharo\
"Belt>rc the inattei and anti-mat
ter produtetl in the Big Bang had a
chance to annihilate into photons,
the presence ol < T violation pro
duced an inlinilesimalh small im
halant eol matter over anti-mat tei ."
Dorian s.iid "When the annihila
tion took plat e, some quai ks were
then-lore lelt unpaired and it is
these quarks that became the pro
tons and neutrons ol <>m mallei
dominated I inverse."
Baßar has givt'n real evidence
to this theorv
l'atru i.i Bui ( hat. a ph\ si( s pro

laborators m the Baßar project,
was (autious about the results.
At cording to her. il the (11' vio
lation was the onh phenomenon
responsible fora lopsided uni
verse. there would be 10 billion
times less matter than thereat tual
l\ is. Hence, there must be other
factors involved.

Dorian commented that the si/e
of CP violation seems to be ((insis
tent with tlie range predicted bv
the Standard Model. He said that
two to three vears gathering more
data are needed to confirm a true
deviation and then stientists will
revise the Model at(ordinglv.
"1 his is just the beginning of the
... program," Dorian said." I here
are manv more measurements to
make before we understand CP vi
olation fullv ."
1 he program will last .it least
10 vears.

The Experiment
I he experiments at SL\(. con

the mat bine that pumps B mesons

nel more than a mile around, and
was built in partnership with the
l-.rnest () Liwrence Berkelev Na
tional Laboratory and the
Lawrence Livermore National
1 xilxiratory.
Inside, beams of electrons

and positrons — their antimat
ter counterparts — are acceler
ated close to the speed of lit;lu
.ind smashed together. The col
lisions give rise to li mesons and
anti-li mesons.
Kach li meson consists of a few
quarks, the fundament.il building
blocks ol protons and neutrons
making up the atomic nucleus. li
mesons survive for onlv a tril
lionth ol .1 second and travel just
one-hundredth ol an inch before
de( a\ ing.
1 he biggest and most expensive
pie( e of equipment is the 1.200-lon
detector. It contains a SO percent

mixiure and 71 10 sensors ranging
