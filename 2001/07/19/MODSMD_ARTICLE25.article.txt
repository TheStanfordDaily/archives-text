Baby, let's do il with the black light on
At 3!t() Kite h, the front desk was whimsi
callv lit with black lights, leading me to
reminisce ol those happv davs ol disco
bowling at the Dakota Bowler.una in St.

it prohahh should have.
Bl.uk lights are prettv much just like
regul.il lluorescent lights, except that thev
don't have white phosphoi coatings. All
lluorescent lights, including black lights,
emplov phosphors — substances that emit
visil)lc light in response to being struck
with radiation. I he phosphors (onvert the

112 luorescent colors are especiallv bril
liant under black lights bee a use, in contrast
with normal colors 1 hat simplv rcllee t light,
lluorescent colors absorb the radiation and
re-einii it as visible light, making them look
much brighter. 1 Ins explains win the

(Ihemicailv, this is what is happening,
fluorescent tubes contain inercun vapor

I o s.il? <>r not to sag: breasts uncovered
For some reason that I tail Mill not ex
plain, it has seemingh become a trend lor
voting girls at dubs to shed their tops and
dam e in their bras. I his doesn't bother me
I dare s.i\ that this behavior is strangeh
liberating, even though I have been and
will continue to opt for full coverage of my
nu ii mamillaries w bile in public.
but are these bafflingh complex under
garments realh worth their cup si/e.' It
seems not to be the case.
Karh doctors thought that ligaments
that supported breasts had to be support
ed But the wa\ the ligaments react to grav
ii\ depends on the elasticit\ ol the skin and
breast <lciisit\ more than anything else.
And the elastic it\ ol vour skin is based on
heredit\.
Boobs start to sag because of the pro
portion ol light weight Cat and heavier glan
dular tissue in vour breasts. Wearing a bra
will not change this since, excepting the
areolas ,uid lobules, the only muscles asso
ciated with the breasts are behind tlieni. So
supporting the breasts with the fabric and
elastic in a bra won't strengthen vour liga
ments. I lowevei. push-ups and su inuning
work the chest muscles, so partaking in
these activities will make your rack much
more perky.
But no matter what, in 20 wars your
boobs will migrate further southward than
Canadian geese and there's nothing you
c ,ui do about it. So shed those bras, girls,
embrace vour womanhood and go com
mando st\ le.
