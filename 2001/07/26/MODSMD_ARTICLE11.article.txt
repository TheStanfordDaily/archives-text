I-1 iedtnan also announced that Stanfoirl
has sci tit ed a Preferred Provide! Option
plan foi dependents from 11 ealth Net, a
California-based health insurance
provider. Dependents were previously
covered by a Health Net Health Mainte
naiK e ()rgani/ation.
I he increase will affect a significant
portion o! undergraduate and graduate
students with spouses and oi children.
I he rate of iiu lease is lower than ( .owell
officials pre\iousl\ had estimated, wliich
was believed could run between .">0 to (it)
percent higher than last \ear. (lowell ofli
(i.ils were seart long foi a plan that would
give dependents access to Stanford ph\si
i i.ins and farilities, and settled on the
Health Net PPO.
According to fried man, costs were re
dined greatly h\ a one-time contribution
of I'nivei sit\ resources to Health Net to
offset student pieiniuins.
file monthh rate for spouses will be
$111, a lf> percent increase ovei last year's

i ost I he i ale lor one < liild will be $05, a 22
pertent inrle.ise, and (overage for two or
more children will cost $137, a 23 percent
iik lease.
"Although higher than I had wished, I
am hopeful that these rates will permit our
student families to keep tlieii health insur
ance coverage and tlieii choice of physi
< ians," I' l iedman said yestei r!a\
According to Friedman, the rate m
(lease is the lesult of a "national (i isis" in
health tare that li.is aflected students with
dependents on (.imposes throughout the
l lilted States.
Friedman's tierision comes on the heels
of concerns voiced b\ representatives of
the Crarluatc Student Council that a
greatei than 50 pei ( cut inr tease in nionth
l\ premiums would font' main students
with dependents to opt out of t < >vci age al
together forcing tliein to reh upon publir
liealth assistant e.
In what he said was a "personal reac
tion to the I diversity's derision, Mill
('amy, a doctoral i.mdidatc in the Ceo
phvsics Department and at ting (iS(c hair,
expressed happiness with the additional
funding but concern about the future.
" I he (additional I niversity] hinds an
nount ed are t ertainlv appreciated." ( in ry
said. "It is good to see that money was
tound for students who reallv need it. It is
unloilunate, though, that it was only a

short-term .solution. Ilopelully .1 long-term
solution can be found soon. A 16 to 21 per
< cnt increase is still a si/able increase, but it
< ertainly is much less than the 50 to (i() per
< ent that was expected."
Students unable to afford the increase in
dependent health care coverage have a
numbei of<>ptions, according to ('.owe 1 1 of
ficials. In the e-mail to students, Friedman
specified two county and state-sponsored
plans, tilled "Healthy Kids" and "Healthy
families," which provide access to Welch
Road and Lucille Packard Children's Hos
pital |)h\sic i.ms ai reduced cost.
Several questions still remain among
students with dependents.
Specifically, international students ma
nic ulating at Stanford on a |-1 student visa
have quest ions regarding possible deporta
tion if they are forced to rely upon public
health assistance for dependents. While
C.owell is consulting with Bechtel to work
through this issue, no answers have been
given regarding possible* deportation.
"li looks like (Stanford health care ad
ministrators! .iic- still undetermined about
vis.i issues and there is still a possibility of
deportation for international students,"
('urn said.
"We are double checking now with at
tornevs to make sure that the plans offered
with some state and county support do not
|c.uisc* deportation problems lot students

and dependents]," Friedman said.
Also, questions remain regarding how
same-sex dependents will be affected In the
change to the PPO plan and rate increase
"Some plans marketed to international
students do not oiler same-sex coverage wit li
outside insurers. Our plan does and will
oflei same-sex coverage," Friedman said.
While the short-term contribution of
Stanford to Health Net will help keep rate
increases lower than expected for this yeai.
Friedman saitl alternatives would have to
be looked at for the long-term.
"We're going to need to come up with
an alternative and right now we're not
going to rule any alternatives out," Frietl
man saitl. "In conjunction with student
input, we'll look at all the options available
and measure them against what students
need and what students are asking for."
Cowell and University administrators
will attempt to answer questions from af
fected students at three information ses
sions, beginning 7 p.m. today in the Ks
conditio Village Center. The two remain
ing sessions will take place in the FA
Center tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. and Mon
thly at 7 p.m.
Friedman saitl a detailed information
al packet about the PPO plan will be avail
able next week, and a Web site with in foi
ination should be available some time
thereafter.
