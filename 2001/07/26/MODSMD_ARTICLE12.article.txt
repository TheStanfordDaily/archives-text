" I'hose standards [passed bv the Clin

raise the standards," said Margaret Han

the (lalifornia Labor Association, ilanlon
(Jradie was involved in the Stanford
protest as an organizer and also as the yell
leader.

"I hr protestcis wei e making themselves
heard in support of stronger federal ac
commodations for ergonomic s." Stanford
Police Lieutenant Del Bandy said. " I he\
were verv well-behaved and put down their
signs when the\ went inside and listened to
the presentations for about ten minutes.
I hen they i hunted for about three minutes
and left."
Ac cording to 1 ino Set iano, the region
al director of the U.S. Department of
Labor, "There were about 100 picketers
(.111 sing We heard from .1 nuinbei
of injured workers and heads of unions
who weie essentially outraged at the laboi
department foi not having higher er
gonomic standards."
I he protestors aimed primarily to
voice their support of a federal standard,
I lanlon-( iradie said.
"We have a lot of anger at this point for
Secretary Chao and the Labor Depart
ment for how we feel workers are being
treated, she said.
I lie hearing was not 1 onsidered .1 suc
cess by the ACL-CK), Hinlon-(>radie
said. Chough both businesses and work
ers had a chant e to express t heir sides of
the issue, "the\ didn't even discuss how
worker injuries should be handled," she
said.
Che forum was sponsored by the I S
Labor Department, not by Stanford.
"We wanted it close to Silicon Valley,
since a lot of the concerns involve ke\-
hoarding and Carpal-Tunnel Svndrotne.
We wanted it to be near both the busi
nesses and the workers in the South Bay.
Che other forums were also held at uni
versities, and we felt like Stanford was a
good choice," Serrano said.
