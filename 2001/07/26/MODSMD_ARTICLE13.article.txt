union housekeepers.
.Wording to Assistant lo the Presi
dent Jell Wachtel, seven people deliv
ered .1 letter to the Office of the Presi
dent, which had been signed by house

tal.
I he controversy centers around the
interpretation ola union agreement
with both the University and Stanford
I lospital regarding whether housekeep
ers of the new Center for Clinical Sci
ences Research should retain union cov
erage. After the CCSR was opened in
May 2000,1 he I ,<x al 71 "> union went be
fore the National labor Relations Board
in order to determine whether house
keepers of the new building, not men
tioned in the original contract, should be
covered. I he NLRB ruled in their favor
in Marth 2001, asserting coverage ol all
Hospital housekeepers under the Uni
versity's agreement.
According to Debra Zumwolt, gener
al counsel lor the University and Hospi
tal, "The housekeepers at the CCSR

don't want to be a part of the union.
Since [that ruling], the housekeepers
asked that Stanford seek review of the
decision, which is what Stanford is
doing."
The eleven (XISR housekeepers arc
being provided with the same benefits
,tiul coverage by the hospital that would
otherwise be provided by their union,
Zumwolt said.
However, according to Marta
Ramirez, the worksite organizer at the
Stanford Hospital, the other union
housekeepers believe that all house
keepers employed by the University
should without exception also be mem
bers of the union.
"The new University building is not
in the contract, but it's the same group
that is cleaning it," Ramirez said.
Stanford Hospital housekeeper Sam
Prassad also stands in favor of union
membership for University housekeep
ers across the board.
"We all work for the same depart
ment and are very upset about what's
happening at the |('.CSR|. We won that
case and we don't understand why
[Stanford Hospital is] wasting money
and appealing now," Prassad said.
"We want to see President Hennessy
take some leadership on our behalf. I he
University should not appeal the dec i
sion," Ramirez said.
The issue, however, has not yet been
resolved.
"It's a question of the interpretation
of this agreement between the workers
and the Hospital," Zumwolt said.
