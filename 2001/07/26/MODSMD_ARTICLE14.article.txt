State of the World and its Discontents."
l he event, which ends I uesday, is sponsored by
the World Association of International Studies, for
merly known as the California Institute of Interna
tional Studies.
"The goal of the conference is to bring in people
from all over the world with different viewpoints,"
said Ronald Hilton, professor of Romance lan
guages. emeritus in the linguistics department and
president of the association. "We want to see who is
for and who is against [globalization] in each partic
ular field and why. We also want people who may
have never met each other to be able to exchange
ideas."
Stanford will be heavily represented in the con
ference, with a number of faculty and Hoover fel
lows participating, as well as President |ohn Hen
nessy and Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLen
nan. Other participants include Jerry O'Rourke,
interfaith and ecumenical officer for the Archdio
cese of San Francisco; Pan Wei, associate professor

I lung Shur.
According to 1 lilton, participants will be divid
ed into panels based on subject areas such as
health t are, terrorism, economic s, the media and
sports.
" The panel discussions will be a good chance for
scholars to engage each other and have serious dis
cussions on .i number of issues," I lilton said. "They
have been divided into fields [in] which we think
globalism is important."
While the conference will allow a multitude of
viewpoints on globalization, the association presi
dent has some very definite opinions on the issue.
"I'm in favor of [globalization], but I realize
there are some very serious problems with it,"
Hilton said. "I have no patience for all these
demonstrators, many of whom are ignorant, vio
lent show-offs. I hey do damage to serious people
looking at the issue.
"In Europe, it is much more difficult to fire work
ers than it is in the United States, and workers feel
safer in European countries. I here is a lot of re
sentment [in the U.S.] about all these firings. We
need to create an environment where workers are
respected."
fhe conference will begin Saturday at 9 a.m. in
the Bookstore, with presentations by seven authors
who have written books on globalization issues.
