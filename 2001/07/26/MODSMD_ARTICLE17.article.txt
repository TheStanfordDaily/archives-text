Carko and senioi infielder Chris
()'Riordan were also selected from
among the nine Stanford players
playing on Cape Cod this summer.
Although the game itself failed
to hold nine li drama — the hast di
vision won 10-1 — the home run
derby provided plenty of fireworks.
Cooper, playing for the first
placc Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox,
was chosen along with Orleans'
Larry Broadway (Duke) and
Brewster's |av Carthwaite (Wash
ington) to represent the Hasteni
division in the derby. Facing
Wan-ham's Matt Mm ton ((ieorgia
lech), Hyaiinis' Ryan Bartheleniv
(Florida State) and Bourne's (.had
()liva (jat ksonville) from the West,
Cooper hit four to advance to the
finals with Million.
After a seven-homer first
round, including a streak ol four
in a row. Murton looked unstop
pable heading into the finals. But
he cooled oil at the wrong time,
hitting only two and allowing

Cooper to claim his second
straight crown with a three-homei
linal round.
(hooper hit 'M home runs in 4(»
games for the (Cardinal this
spring.
Although (looper didn't sec ai
tion in the game, the other (lardi
nal All-Stars fared well. Junioi
pitt her Rvan (iloger, carrying ,i 2
2 record and 1.91 KRA lor Brew
ster through seven starts going into
the game, pitched a scoreless third
inning lor the Fast, (iloger made
onl\ one appearance for the C '.ai (li
nal during the regular season.
I he West named anothei
pair of Stanford starters to theii
team, O'Riordan and (iarko, .il
though O'Riordan was the onl\
Cardinal representative to earn
a start Saturday. Although O'Ri
ordan did record a hit. going I
for !l. his most significant conn i
billion on the day came in the
first when the East's fyler
Davidson (Washington) slapped
a sharp grounder up the middle,
file ball took a tricky hop and
O'Riordan hobbled it, allowing
the Last's Danny Matienzo
(Miami) to score on the error.
(larko went 0 for 2.
All told, the game featured
close to 50 of the nation's premiei
college players, proving its repu
tation as .i popular summer desti
nation lor future big leaguers. Al
though the league can trace its
roots back to 1885, when two
small teams from Sandwich and
Barnstable laced off, the league
only began to gain respect in tin
baseball world in the twenties
foday, both the National and
American Leagues help keep the league fi
nancially afloat — tickets to CCBL games
are free, although teams suggest a donation
— and funding also comes 112 rom the Yawkey
Foundation, which owns the Boston Red
Sox.
Many college players view the CCBL as
an ideal venue to gain exposure to major
league baseball, a perception justified b\ the
presence Saturday of more than 70 major
league scouts and media personages, in
cluding FSl'N's Peter Gammons.
I nlike college baseball teams, whit h use
aluminum bats, CCBL teams use wooden
bats like those used in the majors. Those
bats, along with the high level of competi
tion, make the league a favorite place
among scouts to judge how a player will
make the transition from college to the
major leagues.

Other Cardinal players looking to gain
valuable experience and exposure on the
Cape this summer include sophomore
pitcher Andrew Fhrlich, senior infielder

senior pitcher |.l). Wilcox.
Sophomore outfielder Sam Fuld was
originally slated to join O'Riordan with the
Cotuit Kettleers but chose to play with
lea in USA .is they tout the United Slates
and Japan.
The most surprising contributions,
however, have tome from the bat of Garza.
As a catcher playing behind Garko this
past season, Gar/a saw little action. Start
ing a meager five games, (larza finished off
the year batting only . 177.
Platooned with (iarko again this summer
at catcher for the llvannis Mets, Gar/a has
begun to make a name for himself around
the league. With a team-leading batting av
erage of .317, Garza has developed into one
of the Mets' biggest clutch hitlers.
Flaying Brewster earlier this month,
Garza batted in four runs on the way to tying
a league record of three doubles in a game.
Hyannis went on to win the game 12-1,
snapping a two-game losing streak.

The most surprising contributions,
