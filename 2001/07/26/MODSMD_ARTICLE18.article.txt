bit, particularly when my choices
for entertainment are the Orioles-

• Nothing's funnier than watching golf
columnists work themselves into a frenzy
about David Duval now that he's won a major.

He's finally got the lx*st
player-to-nev er-win-a

erase Tiger's name from

Sorry, does anyone re
member last summer's
British Open, when they
went head-to-head?

Watching Duval hack bis way into the
Road Bunker was when you knew I iger
was in his kitchen like Fmeril. Wake me
when Mr. Iceman holds a lead against
someone tougher than Bernhard "Poppin'
