# Golf, spackle and blubber: the dog days of summer
## In the endless desert of cycling highlights, Coops takes on the world of sports and plumbing 
### 
The dog days of summer are upon
us, and my thoughts tend to drift a
bit, particularly when my choices
for entertainment are the Orioles-
Rangers game, l our de France highlights
or watching spat kle dry:
• Nothing's funnier than watching golf
columnists work themselves into a frenzy
about David Duval now that he's won a major.

He's finally got the lx*st
player-to-nev er-win-a
majoi monkey off bis back
and suddenly he's ready to
erase Tiger's name from
the record lx>oks.
Sorry, does anyone re
member last summer's
British Open, when they
went head-to-head?

Watching Duval hack bis way into the
Road Bunker was when you knew I iger
was in his kitchen like Fmeril. Wake me
when Mr. Iceman holds a lead against
someone tougher than Bernhard "Poppin'
Fresh" I.anger.
