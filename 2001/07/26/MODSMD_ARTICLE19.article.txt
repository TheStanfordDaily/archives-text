# New pro Granville falls
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
It seemed appropriate that
Laura Granville play her liist
professional Samex Women's
l'ennis Association match on
Court One at the I aube Family
l'ennis Stadium.
Alter all, that was the eourt
where Granville, who turned
pro this summer after her
sophomore year at Stanford,
played her home matches as a
Cardinal and stomped on every
♦opponent she faced during the
past two years.
But the new experience of
playing on that court as a profes
sional brought with n another
experience that Granville isn't
too familiar with: losing.
Meilin I u, ranked 38th in the
world, spoiled Granville's pro
debut, defeating the two-time
NCAA singles (hainpion l-li, t>-2,
(i-l at the Bank ol the West Clas
sic Wednesday.
"It definitely felt very dilferent
out there today," Granville said.
"I'm used to playing here with
Stanford fans and my teammates
behind me."
Granville jumped ahead .1 set
thanks to a slew of earlv mis
takes by I'u, who repeatedlv hit
routine baseline shots into the
net in the match's opening
games. With In struggling,
(ii am i lie overt ame a 2-0 defu 11
to take the lirst set (i- land

opened up a 2-0 lead ovei I'u in
the second.
But I u finally staited getting
the ball over the net, and
Gramille struggled to keep up
as I'u worked every corner of
the court.
A missed break point by
(iranville in the third game set off
a full-scale momentum swing to
Ill's side of the court.
"I felt it was really important
to get that game and go up 3-0,
because that would have put a lot
of pressure on her," Granville
said. "That was a tight game, but
I didn't get the break there and
she was able to really pick up her
game from that."
As fu got into a steady
rhythm, Granville found herself
racing from side to side on the
court.
With In in control of play,
Granville could not avoid making
a number of errors as she
watched tlie match slip away.
I 11 broke Granville three
times in a row in taking six
straight games to close out the
second set 0-2. Granville was
clearly outmatched 111 the third
set, as 1 u controlled play on al
most every point en route to .1
(>-l victory.
"I thought I was fitter in the
third sci .Hid she was a step slow."
said I u, who won her liist WTA
event earlier this year in Auck
land, New Zealand.
" l liis is a big tournament and

I n is a great player, so I think 1
was a lot more intimidated play
ing out on ill.ii court than I have
been before," Granville said.
While she was visibly disap
pointed with her defeat,
Granville acknowledged that she
lias a long road ahead of her as
she starts her professional career,
"There's definitely a differ
ence [between college players
and professionals!," she said.
"They hit the ball harder and
more consistently and they are in
much better shape.
"It's a much different level. I
doii'i think it's unrea< liable, bill I
have to get in shape and get the
experience to be able to go out
and pla\ with this level of pros."
Granville will spend the next
month training 111 Florida and
plaving in smaller tournaments
around the country, where the
competition will not be as stiff as
at this v\eek's tournament, which
presents one of the deepest
fields on lhe tour t Ins ye.u .
I fer first summer as a pro w ill
he- capped oil with her first ap
pearance at the I S. ()pen, which
begins Aug. 27.
'Tin looking forward to plav
ing smaller tournaments and
pi< king up some wins and getting
my ranking up," (iranville said.
"It might have been too much to
play in this tournament, but later
ou over the next months 1 look
forward to getting to pla\ again
at this level."
