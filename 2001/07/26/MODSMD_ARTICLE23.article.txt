I)<>n'i Ik' fooled l)\ tlu* airpla\
Ntaind's llrsi two singles have ic
(entl\ received. I hfir newest
album, "Break tlit* Cycle," is not
lot the weak of heart in the etno
tionalh unstable, even il the
radio hietidh songs "It's Been
Aw bile" and "C )nt.side" have Been
tearing tip mainstream radio.
I nlbrtunately, it has now he
tome cliche m pop ro< k to t.ilk
ahont how much you hate vour
parents ot how \<>u want to break
something, and lead singer
Aaron Lewis understands this
and moves beyond it. "Break the
(l\clc" is a tour de lone of metal

. and soulful guit.u that expels
Lewis's emotional and cathartic
bloodletting. It will leave you
emotion.illv exhausted and hold
ing \our nieinorx 111 yoin own
(jtiivering hands.
Lewis and Ins mates have
taken his powerlulh poetii l\ii(s
and seamlessly added perfectly
meshed music—which at times
haunts and at othet times excites
to prodiue an album that is
devoid of a restful moment. I lie
potent combination ol music and
powerful lyrics, which has been
bobbing helplessly in the raven
ous sea of pop rock for some
time, is given a healthy dose from
the shock paddles by Staind.
While Lewis expunges his

pain with the rawness and nil
uerahilitx that hasn't been seen 111
ro< k lor quite some time, the
group adds booming drums and
soulful guitat solos that hold up
Lewis's voice when it threatens to
be overrun with his excessive
angst and emotion — and this
happens more than oike. I Ins
reason alone — to hear Lewis
reach into his heart and memory
to sort through Ins tremendous
pain — is enough to pun base
this album.
However, Staind avoids the
hackncved formula ol emotional
rock, which has ustiallx been rel
egated to the underworld of
punk ot big hair bands. Hut don't
come into this album expecting

to grab a glass of wine, turn down
t lie lights, draw a warm b.nli and
gi\e it a listen. I lie album
iiiiisu . I\ri« s .nid pain — requires
an investment ol more than time.
Lewis challenges his listeners to
gathci tlicit own stories and ask
themselves the same questions he
lias raised fbi himself. Main of
the songs explore Lewis's hu
mane quest lor an answer, a wax
out. I nlike the fun beats ol
M I V, Lewis doesn't offer a
happy, lairv-tale ending but in
stead provides an experienced
meniorx that rarelx satisfies.
I his is the wax ol the album.
Staind will come at you 111 main
different ways — with its lyrics
alone, with its music or with the

combination of both — to disarm
vou and make \<>u take \oui (iwn
pain .uid examine it. I Ins is the
powei of Staind, the command ol
the title ol its album, "Break the
( m le." Staind isn't just asking
vou to buy I licit album, thc\ re
asking you to do something
more. If you can, hu\ the album
and take a chance.
