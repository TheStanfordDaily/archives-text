# 'I see a bad soundtrack, even though my love is real'

When I was a kid. .ill 1 did was
listen lo movie soundtratks. I'm
not talking about those abom
inable compilations ol tills Imm
big name artists tli.it the studios
package as .mother stralegit
marketing tool — the (list s usual
ly given the laughably discreet
subtitle "niiisit from and inspired
by the motion picture." I'm talk
ing about bona title movie stores
— the orchestral music written
specifically loi youi movie. M\
stereo was constantly blasting
epit themes and dramatk cues
composed by the likes ol Danny
film.in. |ames Horner. Hans
/immer, |err\ (ioldsinith and
others. Above all there was |ohn
Williams, whose larger-than-life
score lot "Stiii Wars" can be cred
ited with redefining the whole
concept ol commercial movie
stores.
Knter then, il urn will,
Williams's latest soundtrack re
lease. "A.I bottom line, the

11111< t ion ola mo\ ie

"A.1.." one ol the things
I noted was how 1111-
t liar.it teristicalh sub

was. 11 seemed .1 good
effort, an admirable
willingness to sacrifice
homhastii overture lor
the mood ol the film.
On disc, though, the
compromise is far less
appret iable.

ground music. There's a method
to the mundanity; it's meant to
match the Kubrick-like pat ing of
the film's first act.

"Stored Memories and

"Where Dreams are

nice vocal solo, and
"The Search for the
Blue fairy" begins
mired in darkness but
eventually segues into
the store's most haunt

which embodies
David's wistful longing
and the entire fairytale

atmosphere of Spielberg's film.
It's here you really notice just
how perfectly suited Williams is
lor Spielberg and why theii
decades-long collaboration has
thrived.

Spielberg got quite a l)il of
flak lor succumbing lo his
"happy ending syndrome" on
this movie, hut for his choices
i he situalion proves once again
that Williams is the perfect man
for scoring every Spielberg
film; even at his darkest,
Williams's music is often a little
too bright and brassy to convey
the ultimate despair and dark
ness that Kubrick might have
required for his version of the
lilm. Alas, "A.1." was not meant
to be that movie. While the
score plays an effective role on
screen, ii just doesn't add up to
enough on its own.
