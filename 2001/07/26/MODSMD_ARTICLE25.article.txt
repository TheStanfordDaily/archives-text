# 'The Laramie Project' does not do justice to the life of its protagonist
## 
### CAROLINE SAKAMOTO STAFF WRITER 
Alter a few critical just misses
this year, the Berkeley Repretory
Theatre finally won them over
with "The Laramie Project."
Extended through July 22
from its original run until )nlv 8,
the production was the effort of
director Moises Kaufman and his
Tectonic 1 heater Project. As the
narcissistic name might tell you,
Moises .iihl conipam wanted to
make lasting impressions on the
ater through experimental, con
troversial projects.
I 'his time they (hose mur
dered I niversity of Wyoming
student Matthew Shepard .is
their subject. The storv was told
documentary style, with the
members ol the theater group
rapidly shifting in and out ol
their own identities and those ol
the townspeople ol Laramie,
Wyo.
Although the critics raved
about the show, I found the pro
duction had several weak points
and cliches that were painfully
apparent even among some
glimpses into very good acting
ability.

Kaufman and company at
tempted to weave a world be
yond Matthew Shepard's in
Laramie, but the truth is that
Laramie is what it is because ol
what happened. The national
consciousness would have con
tinued to omit Wyoming (in
deed, most ol the landlocked
United States) had the murder
not happened.
As such, a peripheral storyline
about .t mother-daughter rela
tionship fell llat. The moments
spent exploring the lives ol queer
people in l.aratnie, though, were
compelling in their relevance.
The theater company's attempts
to dist.nice their liberal selves
from this "hick town" drew
laughs ("We are staying at the
liest Western. 1 hope it is a bettei
western"), but backfired in their
mockery ol the town.
Another mistake was the time
spent introducing .ill the cast
members (actually a part oi the
script) and how they felt about
going to Wyoming. It's one ol the
reasons the play was too long and
added much less than the por
trayals of the townspeople.
Kelli Simpkins was solid in all
of her roles, from a friend of

Matthew's to the young boy who
finds the dying Matthew. In her
monologue .is the boy, she trans
formed herself from a (i-foot
woman to a cowering preteen
paralyzed with fright. Her deliv
ery was captivating.
Another standout was James
Asher, who made acting look de
ceptively easy. He played a lim
ousine driver, a young actor who
defies his parents by auditioning
fora role in the gay play "Angels
in \met ica" and finally plays the
accused killer ol Matthew. His
transformations were dean, and
he made even role memorable.
Special effects and video dips,
sin h as on-stage i .iin and footage
ol the actual bar that Matthew
Shepard visited before his min
der, augmented the drama.
