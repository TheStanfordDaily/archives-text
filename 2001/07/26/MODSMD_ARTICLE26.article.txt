## Boom, bust and echo: The rise and fall of the dot-com 
### VIC REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since the technology stock plunge in Apr. 200(1. many dot-com
companies have become dot-bombs. Some Stanford students who
stopped out to work for Internet companies have come hack to
campus, and some Stanford graduates have put then startup
dreams on hold anil gone to work for more established companies.
A few Stanford startups have been successful. Here are Jour dot
commers and then stories.

Stomping the Valley with Ben Stein
During winter quarter of the 1009-2000 school vear,
seniot Rvan Parks brought movie and television star. IVp

After his talk. Stein stayed in Silicon Y'alle\ to pitch a
startup st heme to some investors. Although his first idea
didn't sell. Stein, Parks and two othet students soon i ante
up with one that did — Ben Stein I niversity. <» dot-com
i ompany that would capitali/e on Stein's celebrity image.
Brian karim/.ad and Nit k C.lements, both class of 2000,
were the other two students who worked to develop Ben
Stein I niversity into a high-stakes online knowledge
game hosted b\ Stein.
"In retrospect, we didn't have much, but in the heyda\
of everything getting funded, we all thought we were bril
liant," Parks said. "We kept getting meetings with [ven
ture capitalists]... We finally talked to Shockwave — they
were funding celebrities to do content ."

Shockwave was impressed b\ the Flash demo that the
trio ol students had created and bought Ben Stein Uni
versity. But it never developed the idea into a functional

Web site.
"Ben Stein had the lore
sight in our deal to iiu hide
.1 default pay inent clause in
t.ise Shockwave did not go
public within a year," Parks
said. "They didn't and,
without that clause, we'd
still be holding confederate
currency."
Parks is matter-of-fact in
explaining Ins motivation
for working on Ben Stein
I niversity. "I did it mostly
because of greed," he said.
"Now .1 little hit of money
has come in, but it's about
the same that would have
been earned with a summei
internship. It wasn't the best
use of time."

Nonetheless, Parks sees
one benefit from working on Ben Stein I Diversity, "I
probably wouldn't be as content with my job at Apple
1 ight now if I hadn't experiented that," he said, "ft makes
me appreciate a solid company with real dim tion.
Parks' long term plans still include founding a startup
someday. but for now he is enjoying woi king as .1 software
developei for Apple Computer, karim/ad is employed
with Ceneral Mills in Minnesota and Clements works in
venture capital in Zurich, Swit/ei land.
Working fora startup that hasn't failed yet
One week 111 Feb. 2000, Paul Martin was a track star
and .1 pi e-law history major. The next week, he was a col
lege dropout and an employee at a promising dot-com
t ailed PavPal. Pay Pal provides instant and secure online
pay ment services.
Martin explained the reason for the dramatu change.
"The stuff that I was doing at Stanford was fun, but I
wasn't terribl\ excited about it.he said. "I he people at
Pay Pal were incredibly excited about what they were
doing. It was like a big adventure.''

For Pay Pal, ilie excite
nicut did not end witli the
economic downturn, and
the < ompan\ lias attnally
grown stronger since the
NASDAQ nose-dived.
"MostK small businesses
use us," Martin said.
"We're basic ally a far
preferable way to accept
payments than via checks
or through a traditional ac
count with a merchant
provider bank. I lie whole
dot-com meltdown doesn't
affect those small business
es. Out underlying busi
ness model didn't change."
Payl'al has, however, de
laved its IPO as the market
lias become less friendly.

Nonetheless, Marti.Vs overall view is that the technology
stock crash may have been a plus for his company. "It
changed the attitude around the office," he said. "It he

came a real job, something real rather than a gel rich
quick' tiling.'
Martin cites a wider perspective as the biggest benefit
of working fora startup. "I thought there were basically a
few tilings I could do," lie said. "I was probably going to
go to law school, just because I didn't know what other op
tions there really were. At Pay Pal, I've seen that if you're
kind of bright and willing to work hard, you can go do just
about anything."'
file most obvious benefit of working fora successful
startup is the money. For Martin, that means "not having
to rush into something that may be sub-optimal just to pay
the hills." It also means wedding bells.
"I'm getting married this December," lie said. "Usually
the one thing that you definitely don't have in a marriage be
tween a 22 year-old and a 23 year-old is financial security."
When his Pay Pal adventure is over, Martin plans to re
turn to Stanford to finish his degree.
The entrepreneurial spirit never dies
At age 13, Steve Oskoui started his first company, an
online video gaining maga/ine. I le has had the entrepre
neurship bug ever since, and the technology stock crash
has hardh fazed him.
In the summer <>12000, after his junior year, Oskoui
decided to take a break from school in order to start a
company called Pico. Pico grew to six employees; it was
to be a mobile telephone company that made use of the
wireless network created by a larger company, Rico
c liet. Unfortunately, Ricoc bet went under, taking Pico
with it.

Pico was more than votir
typical Internet startup — it
tried to he a real hardware
company. "It forced me to take
myself more seriously," said
Oskoui, who found himself ne
gotiating with Valley veterans
twice his age .is he hustled to
make Pico successful.
Now he is returning to what
worked in the early days of the
startup craze. "I think that ac
tually now, in the econoink
downturn, is the hest time to he
a dorm room entrepreneur,"
Oskoui said. He said he feels
that many failed dot-coins had
good ideas hut were over-fund
ed. Consequently, they grew
too (|iii( kl\ and tried to do too
much. 1 he "dorm room entre
preneur," on the other hand,

with .1 smaller stall and a more
modest mission, is unlikch to iall into this trap.
Since I'ico, Oskoni has worked on two smaller hut
more successful startups. Iwo of Oskoni s friends at
I larvard I tiivei sit\ asked for his expertise in launching
Crush Link. Web-savvy secret admirers can contact the
objects ol their aflection via e-mail through the C.rush-
I .ink Wchsite. (Xskoui is also seeing modest returns from
Mr. Smiley, an e-mail newsletter he sends out that tells
its subscribers about heebies and special deals.
()skoui is not sure if he will return to the farm in the
fall, but, in either case, he will stick to his unique ap
proach to entrepreneurship.
Four dot-commers — four different stories, kven
after the tech stock crash, it's likely that the Internet
phenomenon will continue to draw Stanford students
and graduates.

Working fora startup that hasn't failed yet
One week 111 Feb. 2000, Paul Martin was a track star
and .1 pi e-law history major. The next week, he was a col
lege dropout and an employee at a promising dot-com
t ailed PavPal. Pay Pal provides instant and secure online
pay ment services.
Martin explained the reason for the dramatu change.
"The stuff that I was doing at Stanford was fun, but I
wasn't terribl\ excited about it.he said. "I he people at
Pay Pal were incredibly excited about what they were
doing. It was like a big adventure.''

For Pay Pal, ilie excite
nicut did not end witli the
economic downturn, and
the < ompan\ lias attnally
grown stronger since the
NASDAQ nose-dived.
"MostK small businesses
use us," Martin said.
"We're basic ally a far
preferable way to accept
payments than via checks
or through a traditional ac
count with a merchant
provider bank. I lie whole
dot-com meltdown doesn't
affect those small business
es. Out underlying busi
ness model didn't change."
Payl'al has, however, de
laved its IPO as the market
lias become less friendly.

Nonetheless, Marti.Vs overall view is that the technology
stock crash may have been a plus for his company. "It
changed the attitude around the office," he said. "It he

came a real job, something real rather than a gel rich
quick' tiling.'
Martin cites a wider perspective as the biggest benefit
of working fora startup. "I thought there were basically a
few tilings I could do," lie said. "I was probably going to
go to law school, just because I didn't know what other op
tions there really were. At Pay Pal, I've seen that if you're
kind of bright and willing to work hard, you can go do just
about anything."'
file most obvious benefit of working fora successful
startup is the money. For Martin, that means "not having
to rush into something that may be sub-optimal just to pay
the hills." It also means wedding bells.
"I'm getting married this December," lie said. "Usually
the one thing that you definitely don't have in a marriage be
tween a 22 year-old and a 23 year-old is financial security."
When his Pay Pal adventure is over, Martin plans to re
turn to Stanford to finish his degree.
The entrepreneurial spirit never dies
At age 13, Steve Oskoui started his first company, an
online video gaining maga/ine. I le has had the entrepre
neurship bug ever since, and the technology stock crash
has hardh fazed him.
In the summer <>12000, after his junior year, Oskoui
decided to take a break from school in order to start a
company called Pico. Pico grew to six employees; it was
to be a mobile telephone company that made use of the
wireless network created by a larger company, Rico
c liet. Unfortunately, Ricoc bet went under, taking Pico
with it.

Pico was more than votir
typical Internet startup — it
tried to he a real hardware
company. "It forced me to take
myself more seriously," said
Oskoui, who found himself ne
gotiating with Valley veterans
twice his age .is he hustled to
make Pico successful.
Now he is returning to what
worked in the early days of the
startup craze. "I think that ac
tually now, in the econoink
downturn, is the hest time to he
a dorm room entrepreneur,"
Oskoui said. He said he feels
that many failed dot-coins had
good ideas hut were over-fund
ed. Consequently, they grew
too (|iii( kl\ and tried to do too
much. 1 he "dorm room entre
preneur," on the other hand,

with .1 smaller stall and a more
modest mission, is unlikch to iall into this trap.
Since I'ico, Oskoni has worked on two smaller hut
more successful startups. Iwo of Oskoni s friends at
I larvard I tiivei sit\ asked for his expertise in launching
Crush Link. Web-savvy secret admirers can contact the
objects ol their aflection via e-mail through the C.rush-
I .ink Wchsite. (Xskoui is also seeing modest returns from
Mr. Smiley, an e-mail newsletter he sends out that tells
its subscribers about heebies and special deals.
()skoui is not sure if he will return to the farm in the
fall, but, in either case, he will stick to his unique ap
proach to entrepreneurship.
Four dot-commers — four different stories, kven

t ailed PavPal. Pay Pal provides instant and secure online
pay ment services.
Martin explained the reason for the dramatu change.
"The stuff that I was doing at Stanford was fun, but I
wasn't terribl\ excited about it.he said. "I he people at
Pay Pal were incredibly excited about what they were
doing. It was like a big adventure.''

For Pay Pal, ilie excite
nicut did not end witli the
economic downturn, and
the < ompan\ lias attnally
grown stronger since the
NASDAQ nose-dived.
"MostK small businesses
use us," Martin said.
"We're basic ally a far
preferable way to accept
payments than via checks
or through a traditional ac
count with a merchant
provider bank. I lie whole
dot-com meltdown doesn't
affect those small business
es. Out underlying busi
ness model didn't change."
Payl'al has, however, de
laved its IPO as the market
lias become less friendly.

Nonetheless, Marti.Vs overall view is that the technology
stock crash may have been a plus for his company. "It
changed the attitude around the office," he said. "It he

came a real job, something real rather than a gel rich
quick' tiling.'
Martin cites a wider perspective as the biggest benefit
of working fora startup. "I thought there were basically a
few tilings I could do," lie said. "I was probably going to
go to law school, just because I didn't know what other op
tions there really were. At Pay Pal, I've seen that if you're
kind of bright and willing to work hard, you can go do just
about anything."'
file most obvious benefit of working fora successful
startup is the money. For Martin, that means "not having
to rush into something that may be sub-optimal just to pay
the hills." It also means wedding bells.
"I'm getting married this December," lie said. "Usually
the one thing that you definitely don't have in a marriage be
tween a 22 year-old and a 23 year-old is financial security."
When his Pay Pal adventure is over, Martin plans to re
turn to Stanford to finish his degree.
The entrepreneurial spirit never dies
At age 13, Steve Oskoui started his first company, an
online video gaining maga/ine. I le has had the entrepre
neurship bug ever since, and the technology stock crash
has hardh fazed him.
In the summer <>12000, after his junior year, Oskoui
decided to take a break from school in order to start a
company called Pico. Pico grew to six employees; it was
to be a mobile telephone company that made use of the
wireless network created by a larger company, Rico
c liet. Unfortunately, Ricoc bet went under, taking Pico
with it.

Pico was more than votir
typical Internet startup — it
tried to he a real hardware
company. "It forced me to take
myself more seriously," said
Oskoui, who found himself ne
gotiating with Valley veterans
twice his age .is he hustled to
make Pico successful.
Now he is returning to what
worked in the early days of the
startup craze. "I think that ac
tually now, in the econoink
downturn, is the hest time to he
a dorm room entrepreneur,"
Oskoui said. He said he feels
that many failed dot-coins had
good ideas hut were over-fund
ed. Consequently, they grew
too (|iii( kl\ and tried to do too
much. 1 he "dorm room entre
preneur," on the other hand,

with .1 smaller stall and a more
modest mission, is unlikch to iall into this trap.
Since I'ico, Oskoni has worked on two smaller hut
more successful startups. Iwo of Oskoni s friends at
I larvard I tiivei sit\ asked for his expertise in launching
Crush Link. Web-savvy secret admirers can contact the
objects ol their aflection via e-mail through the C.rush-
I .ink Wchsite. (Xskoui is also seeing modest returns from
Mr. Smiley, an e-mail newsletter he sends out that tells
its subscribers about heebies and special deals.
()skoui is not sure if he will return to the farm in the
fall, but, in either case, he will stick to his unique ap
proach to entrepreneurship.
Four dot-commers — four different stories, kven
after the tech stock crash, it's likely that the Internet
phenomenon will continue to draw Stanford students
and graduates.
