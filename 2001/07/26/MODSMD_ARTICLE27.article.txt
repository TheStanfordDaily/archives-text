# Go fish: Stanford neuroscientist gets inside heads of cichlids

Their eyes locked, their fins poised, a
pair of fish—African cichlids —square oil" in
a battle for territory. After an ephemeral
glaiu e, a victor emerges and the loser timid
l\ swims away.
Cichlids reside in Like Tanganyika in
eastern Africa. Russell Fernald, professor in
neurobiology in the department of psycholo
gy, raises them in his lab so that he can ob
sene their behavior. But fernald takes it one
step further by figuring out what regions of
the brain are affec ted by this behavior.
I (hated on the fifth floor of |ordan I fall,
I ernald's lab is a labyrinth offish tanks and
instrument rooms. Interspersed through
the lab, you'll find an unusually large num
ber of undergraduate students toiling away
at .1 number of different experiments. I heir
pic lures are also on a wall, next to those of
post-dcxs and graduate students—a true
testament of their indispensabilitv in the
112 ernald lab.
"I've been at Stanford fora long time,
and the most remarkable feature of it is get
ting to know the undergraduates and see
ing theit enthusiasm for research," said Fer
nald. " They're willing to take on riskv pro
jects and they're genuinely full of energy."
However, Fernald is quick to note that
undergraduate students still need mentor
ing because research is a slow—and some
times frustrating—process. Since 17 of Fer
nald's undergraduate students have gone
on to graduate s< liool in the neurosciences,
I ernald's nurturing approach seems to be
an effective way to introduce them to scien
tific research.
Cic hlids arc unique because ol the ease

with which scientists can
study their development.
Using the fish as a model
system, Fernald has done
extensive research on the
relationship between hiain
and behavior.

"You can study growth in mammals,
but that usually happens in utero, where
it's extremely complex and difficult to
study," Fernald said.
In one experiment, Fernald observed
the differences between territoi ial and non
territorial males in an environment subject
ed to systematic changes that mimicked
those in the wild. When a cichlid male won
a light against another male — in the
process gaining the rights to a small patch of
territory — lie underwent various pheno
tvpic c hanges, int hiding bright colorization
and the addition of a black bar across his
eye.
Previous research has shown that when a
male achieved this status, the neurons in the
hypothalamus — a lower region of the brain
— became larger. However, much to Fer
nald's surprise, the winning male's body
si/e actually decreased, whereas the losing
fish increased in body si/e.
To ac count for these results, Fernald hy
pothesized that a territorial male becomes
smaller .is he allocates resources for repro
duction. Simultaneously, non-territorial
males try to increase their si/e so that they
too can eventually become territorial and
reproduce.
In a related study, Fernald determined the
levels of a stress-related hormone — Cortisol
— in both territorial and non-territorial
males. I le found that, in the process of soi t
ing out the social hierarchy, non-territorial

males had a much higher Cor
tisol level than territorial
males. Once again, this is
) counterintuitive because in
| other animal species, the
dominant male usually has a
higher level of stress.
A possible explanation is
that non-ten itori.d c ichlids are

harassed by territorial males
and, in the process, forfeit food opportuni
ties. An alternative hy|)othcsis is th.it non
territorial males obtain higher Cortisol con
centrations due to crowding stress or poor
overall health.
( intently, Kernald is having an under
graduate dno — K\le Straclie and Helen
l.in — investigating the effects of another
hormone — argininevasoux in (AY I ) — on
cichlids.
Strache, a junior majoring in human bi
ologv, injects male cii blids with \\ I . I hen,
with the <iid of videotapes, he observes the
behavioral effects of the hormoneoll the so
cial dynamus in a cichlid tank.
"Lots of other people have studied AY I s
effects in other animals," St rat he said. "Hut
I'm really the first person in the lab to look
at its effects on aggression in < ii blids"
While Strache lonises on the behavioral
effects of AVT, l.in. from the University of
I oronto, concentrates on AY I at .1 molet n
lar level.
"I slice np the cichlid brains, stain them
and look .it the distribution ol AY I in neu
rons," said Liu. "If we see that .1 particular
area of the brain has AY I", then we know
that ii will probably be released as a hor
mone or will trigger some oilier hormone to
be released, and will therefore have an ef
fect on aggressiveness."

Fernald's research on the relationship
between the brain and behavior is only half
of the pic ture, since a large portion of his lab
is devoted to cichlid eye research.
In one study, Fernald reared one group
offish in darkness, while another group was
exposed to white light. Because the c ichlids
deprived of light had eye lenses that did not
produce well focused images, Fernald con
c hided that external light sources pla\ an in
tegral role in the development of a fish's
eye.
Although many animal species activate
the same genes during eye formation, Fer
nald believes that eye evolution can be
traced back to numerous different ances
tors.
"That we have a common gene does not
mean eyes stem from a common ancestor,"
Fernald said. "So as animals evolved eyes,
they ma) have co-opted the same genes, but
they were probably from different sources."
To beltei understand eye development
on a niolec ulai level, Anna Schliessmann, a
junior majoring in human biology, and
llarpreet Dhatt, a sophomore from UC.
Davis, are doing research on progenitor
c ells, which later dilferentiate into photore
ceptor cells that help humans see.
More specifically, Sc hliessmann is look
ing at how .1 signaling molecule — cellular
neurotrophic factor — disrupts progenitor
cells.
" The reason we're studying this in fish is
because they're always developing retina
c ells, while in other species, retinas develop
embrvologic allv," Sc hliessmann said. " The
cichlids keep adding cells throughout lite,
so we can look at any fish and we'll have cells

in .ill stages to look at."
Dhatt is using cloning techniques
to sequence a transcription factor

— estrogen receptor alpha — that
interacts with progenitor cells.
"The implications are really
great because you can actually
look at the retina and solve some
eye problems such as vitamin A
deficiency or degenerative dis
eases that lead to blindness,"

I)h.tit said.
Despite the large number ol
bodies working on projects in the
lab, there is a great sense ol cohe
sion among the resean hers, large
l\ due to Fernald's encouraging
presence.
"He's super-supportive of

everything that you're doing, and
he comes in to (.ilk to us .it lunch,
even though he's really busy,"
Sc hliessmann said.

ions are valued, no matter who
you are," he said. "I think Dr. Fer

"I've been at Stanford fora long time,
and the most remarkable feature of it is get
ting to know the undergraduates and see
ing theit enthusiasm for research," said Fer
nald. " They're willing to take on riskv pro
jects and they're genuinely full of energy."
However, Fernald is quick to note that
undergraduate students still need mentor
ing because research is a slow—and some
times frustrating—process. Since 17 of Fer
nald's undergraduate students have gone
on to graduate s< liool in the neurosciences,
I ernald's nurturing approach seems to be
an effective way to introduce them to scien
tific research.
Cic hlids arc unique because ol the ease

with which scientists can
study their development.
Using the fish as a model
system, Fernald has done
extensive research on the
relationship between hiain
and behavior.

"You can study growth in mammals,
but that usually happens in utero, where
it's extremely complex and difficult to
study," Fernald said.
In one experiment, Fernald observed
the differences between territoi ial and non
territorial males in an environment subject
ed to systematic changes that mimicked
those in the wild. When a cichlid male won
a light against another male — in the
process gaining the rights to a small patch of
territory — lie underwent various pheno
tvpic c hanges, int hiding bright colorization
and the addition of a black bar across his
eye.
Previous research has shown that when a
male achieved this status, the neurons in the
hypothalamus — a lower region of the brain
— became larger. However, much to Fer
nald's surprise, the winning male's body
si/e actually decreased, whereas the losing
fish increased in body si/e.
To ac count for these results, Fernald hy
pothesized that a territorial male becomes
smaller .is he allocates resources for repro
duction. Simultaneously, non-territorial
males try to increase their si/e so that they
too can eventually become territorial and
reproduce.
In a related study, Fernald determined the
levels of a stress-related hormone — Cortisol
— in both territorial and non-territorial
males. I le found that, in the process of soi t
ing out the social hierarchy, non-territorial

males had a much higher Cor
tisol level than territorial
males. Once again, this is
) counterintuitive because in
| other animal species, the
dominant male usually has a
higher level of stress.
A possible explanation is
that non-ten itori.d c ichlids are

harassed by territorial males
and, in the process, forfeit food opportuni
ties. An alternative hy|)othcsis is th.it non
territorial males obtain higher Cortisol con
centrations due to crowding stress or poor
overall health.
( intently, Kernald is having an under
graduate dno — K\le Straclie and Helen
l.in — investigating the effects of another
hormone — argininevasoux in (AY I ) — on
cichlids.

"Lots of other people have studied AY I s
effects in other animals," St rat he said. "Hut
I'm really the first person in the lab to look
at its effects on aggression in < ii blids"
While Strache lonises on the behavioral
effects of AVT, l.in. from the University of
I oronto, concentrates on AY I at .1 molet n
lar level.
"I slice np the cichlid brains, stain them
and look .it the distribution ol AY I in neu
rons," said Liu. "If we see that .1 particular
area of the brain has AY I", then we know
that ii will probably be released as a hor
mone or will trigger some oilier hormone to
be released, and will therefore have an ef
fect on aggressiveness."

Fernald's research on the relationship
between the brain and behavior is only half
of the pic ture, since a large portion of his lab
is devoted to cichlid eye research.
In one study, Fernald reared one group
offish in darkness, while another group was
exposed to white light. Because the c ichlids
deprived of light had eye lenses that did not
produce well focused images, Fernald con
c hided that external light sources pla\ an in
tegral role in the development of a fish's
eye.
Although many animal species activate
the same genes during eye formation, Fer
nald believes that eye evolution can be
traced back to numerous different ances
tors.
"That we have a common gene does not
mean eyes stem from a common ancestor,"
Fernald said. "So as animals evolved eyes,
they ma) have co-opted the same genes, but
they were probably from different sources."
To beltei understand eye development
on a niolec ulai level, Anna Schliessmann, a
junior majoring in human biology, and
llarpreet Dhatt, a sophomore from UC.
Davis, are doing research on progenitor
c ells, which later dilferentiate into photore
ceptor cells that help humans see.
More specifically, Sc hliessmann is look
ing at how .1 signaling molecule — cellular
neurotrophic factor — disrupts progenitor
cells.
" The reason we're studying this in fish is
because they're always developing retina
c ells, while in other species, retinas develop
embrvologic allv," Sc hliessmann said. " The
cichlids keep adding cells throughout lite,
so we can look at any fish and we'll have cells

in .ill stages to look at."
Dhatt is using cloning techniques
to sequence a transcription factor

— estrogen receptor alpha — that
interacts with progenitor cells.
"The implications are really
great because you can actually
look at the retina and solve some
eye problems such as vitamin A
deficiency or degenerative dis
eases that lead to blindness,"

I)h.tit said.
Despite the large number ol
bodies working on projects in the
lab, there is a great sense ol cohe
sion among the resean hers, large

presence.
"He's super-supportive of

everything that you're doing, and
he comes in to (.ilk to us .it lunch,

Sc hliessmann said.
