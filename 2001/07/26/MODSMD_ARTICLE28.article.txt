Audience
I lie audience, composed ot leaders in
industry and research, seemed knowl
edgeable of the subject. During the ques
tion and answei session, man) asked per
tinent technical questions, answered b\
the spe.iket s.
Kanjeevi Shivashankar, a graduate stu
dent in physics, thought the symposium
w.is "absolutely great. He said that the
most interesting part was Kigler's demon
stration of atom movement.
At the end of his speet h, Kigler connect
ed a laptop to the IBM's Alinaden L.ab in
San |ose and moved atoms real-time, show -
ing how the technology has progressed.
"It was absoluteh ama/ing, to see atoms
being .11 tanged in front of von b\ the ver\
man who first implemented the idea,"
Shivashankar said.
Sidnev Kliner. a fourth vear masters in
chemistry, said that the immediate appli
cations of nanotet hnolog) will "most
probably be in the biomcdit a I field.
"I think in ten seat s we should be seeing
today's research being used in belter drug
delivery systems 01 even gene therapy."
Klinet einphasi/ed the field holds "im
mense promises
"Researih finds its uses in the most un
expected u.i\s: nanotet luiology might at
quire uses that we cannot even imagine
now," Klmersaid.
