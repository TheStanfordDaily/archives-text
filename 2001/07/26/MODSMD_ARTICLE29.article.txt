Tahoe versus the volcano

I lie I .ake I alloc basin lonned live to ten
million veai s ago in the down-thrown area
hetween two majoi parallel faults. I he up
thrown areas on either side of the hasin
formed mountain peaks: the Sierra Nevada
in the west and the (.arson Range in the
east. I he lake was formed as streams and
snowfall filled the basin.
About two million wars ago, the north
eastern outlet of the basin, the Iruckee
River, was blot ked by lava flows. I he river
eventually eroded through the volcanit de
posits, resulting in the course it follows
Unlay. I-ater, the western side of the lake
and other parts of the Tahoe area were re
shaped when alpine glaciers squeezed
through valleys and canyons, creating the
shredding ski areas that we enjoy today.

When I turned lour, I had a hirthdav

When I turned fourteen, my family was
vacationing with relatives in the Interlake
area of Manitoba. Being too cool to hang
out with my parents. 1 spent the day at the
beach and returned to the cottage later to
humor my grandparents as they sang
"Happy Birthday," told me how much I'd
grown since the year before and fattened
me up with marble cake and shortbread.
When I turned twenty-four this past
weekend, I was backpacking through the
Sierras in South Talioe with my boyfriend.

Foaming at the mouth
Our hike on Saturda\ took us up the
(ileii Alpine I rail to Alta Morris Lake,
where we set up camp and took a quit k dip.
I pon emerging from the water, we noticed
,i curious llurrv ol foam in the cove below
our campsite. We speculated that it had
been produced l>\ trace amounts of deter
gents in our bathing suits.
However. I later discovered that foam
typically oc( urs in lakes asa result of the de
composition ol organic matter. When fish
and algae decay. they release latt\ at ids —
similar to those found in common soap —
that reduce the surface tension ol the
water. (airrentsand wind-generated waves
agitate the acids and inject air into the
water, creating bubbles. I he foam is most
common in the early morning and is typi
cally gone by midday.
When I wish upon a star
