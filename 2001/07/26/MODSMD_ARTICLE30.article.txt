# Stem cell research attracts controversy, even at Stanford

### VIC REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I his summer, President Bush
will decide whether lo use federal
funds for embrvonit stem tell re
search. I le is currently backed into
.t corner, lobbied from one side b\
those opposed to the research for
ethical reasons and. on the other
side, In those who believe it will
lead to powerful new ways to treat
diseases.
According to one poll, 70 per
cent of Americans support embry
onic stem cell research. Kven 57
pert cut of abort ion opponents and
72 percent of Catholics say that
they are in favor of it, according to
another survey. Those opposed to
this type of research are typically
pro-life, but even stalwart abortion
foes such as Nancy Reagan, Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch, lennessee
Senator bill Frist and former Flori
da Senator Connie Mack have
urged President Rush to allow biol
ogists to experiment with embry
onic stem cells.

Influential figures on the other
side of the issue also have the pres
ident's ear. Farliei this week din
ing their meeting in ItaK. the Pope
challenged Rush to "show the
world the path to a truly humane
future, in which man remains the
master, not the product, of his
technology."
Fhe stem cell debate involves
what to do with the embryos left
over from in vitro fertilization, a
pro* etlurc in w hit li eggs are fertil
ized in the laboratoiA so that infer
tile parents i an have oflspi ing.
In the first stage of enibrvonit
development, a fertilized egg un
dergoes several cell divisions to
form a spherical cell mass called a
"blastocyst," which consists of an
outer layer of cells that will gener
ate the placenta and an inner cell
mass that will create all the tissues
necessary for human life.
Fhe blastocysts that are not
used are eventually thrown away.
Rather than siniplv discard the
embryos, some scientists would
like to extract stem cells from the

inner cell masses, since these (ells
have enormous therapeutic po
tential.

Kxtracting stem cells from an

their tax dollars used lor this pro
cedure.
"I believe that human life begins
.it com eption," said Stanford hiolo

gv graduate student Pedro (iutier
rez."()nc e an ovum has been fet nl
ized, that's a new human being,
and to do experiments on .1 hi 1111.111
being that are not to tiledired ben
efit of thai human l>cing — that's
wrong."
lacii scientists who lavoi re
search with stein c ells are wars of
some of its broader implications.
"We need to be concerned that
we not take a purclv instrumental
view ol developing human life."
said Bioethic s I'rof. William 111111
but.
Proponents of embryonic stem
cell research believe that they are
the true pro-lifers, since the\ want
to improve lives l>\ making use <>l
embryos that are destined to In
thrown out otherwise. Further
more, they don't see the destruc
tion of an embryo in the laboratot \
as murder.
"Microscopic embryosoll a petri
dish do not constitute life." said
Senator I latch.
As an alternative to embryonic
stem cell research, opponents pro

post- dial scientists work exclusively
with .idnll stem (ells, which also have
the potential to he powerful thera
peutic tools. These cells exist iu each
organ ol .111 adult l>o<l\ and tan re
generate tlieit parent organ.
"| I nfortunatel\ |. adult stein
cells are vcr\ difficult to isolate,"
Berg said. "As lat as we know. they
cannot he propagated in the labo
ratory and their potential to he
able to dillerentiatc into different
kinds of tissues is limited."
Although some recent adult
stein 1 ill experiments have pro
duced promising results, most biol
ogists believe that both types of
stem cell research are necessary.
Whatever President Bush's de
cision on federally funded embry
onic stein cell research might be, he
is likely to anger sonic part of his
constituency. I- it her his core sup
porters will be upset that he has
done an about-face 011 an impor
tant bioethics issue or the majority
of biologists will be frustrated to
have a promising reseat (li avenue
blocked.
