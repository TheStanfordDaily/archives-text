### JOHN HUNTER 
Only a Senate confirmation separates |ohn
"Jack" Marburger 111, who receive a doctorate de
gree in physics from Stanford in I9t>7, from the lis
tening ears of President Ceorge W. Bush.
()n |line 25, the president announced his inten
tion to nominate Marburger to the position of Di
rector of ()flice of S( ience and 1 echnology.
" I he direitot of the < )Hlce of S( ience and lech
nology is the highest level science advisor to the
president," said |ames Pfilfner, professor of public
policv .it (ieorge Mason Unversity.
According to Christopher Orr of the White
House's Oflice of the Press Secretary, the director
has two principle jobs: advising the president on is
sues of science and tec hnolog\ polio and sei \ ing as
the direi tor of the ()flic e of Sc ienc e and I ec hnology.
A native of Staten Island, N.Y., Marburger
graduated from Princeton I Diversity with a de
gree in physics before arriving at Stanford in 1902
to stnclv lasets.
"|ohn was always ambitions," former classmate
and Physics Prof. Stephen 11 arris said. "He was one
ol the lit si to lormallv stnd\ the difficult Held of
(]iiantnm optics."
Marburger went on to distinguish himself in sci
entific researt hand ediuation.il administration at
the University ol Southern California and State
University of New York at Stony Brook, where he
acted as dean and president, respectively.
According to the press secretary's announce
ment, Marburger served as the dean of the College
of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of
Southern California from 197b to 1980 and the
State University of New York at Stony Brook
where he served as president and professor from
1980 io 1994
But it was Marburger's professional career that
defined him as cabinet material.
He acted as a consultant to the Liver

more I .aboratory, New York State Energy Office
Review ('.ommission and New York State Fact Find
ing Panel on the Shorehain Nuclcai Power 112 acility.
Ile also served asÂ» hairman of numerous boards
and councils at the Department of Energy's LJni
vei siiv Reseai( h Assot iation, whit li operates Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and the
Supcrcoudut ting Super (Collider in Texas.
"I le is the perfect man for the job," saitl I larold
Mete.ill, physics professor at SUNY-Stony Brook.
"He has filled numerous positions specifically to
put out the fires."
Prof. Wolfgang Panofskv, emeritus and former
director ol SI.AC., also stands in support of Mat
burger.
"I le is a ver\ solic 1 professional. Panofskv said.
"He ai lived .it Brookhavcn at a time of constant
11 isis between the public and the laboratory over
radiation leakage and he did a first-rate job to
solve that."
I he nomination comes at a sensitive time for the
administration, which has been under lire for its
positions tm global warming, missile defense and
stem-t ell reseait h.
"I am concerned that the president has nomi
nated known industrialists it> co-chair some of the
scient e atl\isory t onunittees as well," Panofsky said.
(ieoffrey Rothwell, senior lecturer in the Eco
nomics Department, saitl Marburger is "low-key
politically. As a former SI.AC. man, he will support
Sl.A(funding as well as other nuclear energy con
cerns. but from a political standpoint, nuclear en
ergy is a question of economics."
According to the New York Times, there have
been some issues raised over the fact that Mar
burger considers himself a life-long Democrat.
"I don't think that should be a concern, he has al
ways put aside the politics to find out the facts,"
John Bjorkholm, classmate and principle scientist
at Intel Corp., said.
According to (lalvin Macken
zie of the Brookings Institute,
there have been many com
plaints to the Bush administra
tion already about the lack ol
timely appointments.
But the wait isn't over. While
the controversial funding ques
tions build toward resolve, Nlar
burger idly awaits Senate confir

mation before his appointment
becomes official.
"The Senate might be out to
get him," Stanford Law Prof.
William Gould said. Gould
served .is Labor Relations Board
(Chairman under the ('.linton ad
ministration. "The lesson
learned in the nineties is that the
more expertise and the more in
volved you are, the more diffi
cult it can be to get Senate con
firmation."
"He'll need to be assertive to
ensure he's .it the table on im
portant decisions," said Cliisto

pher C.hyha, associate professor
in the Department of Geological
and Knvironmental Sciences.
C.hyba has also served as advisor
to the Office <>l Science and
l'echnology Policy. " I his will he
hard, because it's late in the ad
ministration to he coming in and
much of the pie has already been
divided up. Dr. Marburger
should light for regular at cess to
the President and Vice Presi
dent. I hat's a challenge, but the
rest of the government will
quickly figure out whether or
not he has it."
