Kbrary, a company dedicat
ed to providing software and
other services dealing wit 11 the
online display of copyrighted
material, released the first beta
version of its "elnaiian on
Wednesday, July 25.
librarian offers Web-pub
lished versions of .'WO business
and economics titles. Students,
consumers and businesses may
browse the site and read the
books made available In the sin
for free. Visitors, however, are
asked to pay for the conve
nience of copying the text from
off of the Web site â€” similai to
a library's charge for photo
copying a book.
According to an ebrary press
release, "partners can leverage
ebrary's unique photocopy
model, where customers pa\
only for printing or copying the

information the\ need without
subscription or membership
lees, or determine a payment
model appropriate to their
businesses."
"We think that someone
would be willing to pay for the
convenience of having the book
copied onto their own comput
er," said Christopher Warnock,
CK() of ebrary.
librarian combines the
fort es of major publishers and
university presses, such as
Random I louse, Mc( Iraw-I I ill,
Yale University Press and oth
ers. Stanford University Press
joined as one of these
providers in order to develop
extensive, set tire online collec
tions t>l titles.
Coupled with research and
t omprehension software,
ebrarian extends typical re
seart hi apabilities In allowing a
visitor to freelv search through
all the books electronically and

to utilize ebrary's advanced
navigation tools.
"We believe that it enables
people and students in particu
lar to conduct research more
easily and to be able to find out
what information is available
other than what's on the Inter
net already," Warnock said.
1 hough currently ebrarian
lias limited itself to business and
economics textbooks, it plans to
eventually expand to include
other disciplines and publish
ers. They are expanding their
collections in other disciplines,
Warnock said, and they will re
lease them once they have
amassed a diverse enough col
lection.
According to Warnock,
ebrarian is currently using
some books published In the
Stanford University Press and
will eventually have books from
the Stanford University Li
braries as well.
