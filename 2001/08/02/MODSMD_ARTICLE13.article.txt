# ACE camp challenges children
## 
### TIFFANY CHOW 
Instead of .mending tennis or
soccer camp, some vouth prelet to
spend their summer indoors learn
ing alxml computers.
American (Computer Kxperi
ence Computer (lamp, which
draws more than 8,000 campers
each year nationwide on 00 lot a
tions, is holding a Stanford
branch of the camp.it Bob.
Rene Sorensen, the directol of
the Stanford site, said that
campers ma\ si.iv for one week or
multiple weeks if they wish,
dampers have a c hoice to com
mute from home, st.iv overnight
or stay for the weekend if they
desire, dampers tend to come
year after year, Sorensen s.iid.
"People sign up for tennis
camp or soccet camp and the\
know exactly what tlie\ are get
ling into," |ohn Beach. vice |)i es
ident of operations, s.nd. "Chil
dren that sign up foi computet
camp are a little uncertain about
what it is going to be.
"What we find out is children
sign up and then a great percent
age of them are having so tunc h fun
that thev want to continue and sign
up fora couple more weeks. Wee .ill

them toll-overs; we have hundreds
of roll-overs each summer."
I lie camp is divided into
main subdivisions to help
campers choose the level that is
right for tliein.
A junior developer is one who
lias minimal knowledge of tec Imol
ogy, but is introcluc ed to safe use of
the Internet, as well as how to start
a "coinpam vvith .1 logo, brcxlture,
and a Web site. I o become a junior
developer, campers usually stay
one to two weeks to meet the re
c|iiireinents.
Students .it the next level up are
called developers. Developers
work on programming, web design
and learn how to program bv creat
ing (licit own computet games or
virtual yearlxxiks. I "hey also learn
to create an interactive web page
with flash animation and then
knowledge of graphic design and
computet ait. I <> produce .ill this.
< .ini|K'rs st.i\ one to three weeks.
A specialist chooses to pursue
am combination of ('.+ + , |ava,
and Advanced VII programming
in self-designed projec is Spec ial
-1 sts learn advanced graphics,
sound production/editing, ad
v.uiced 11-D and flash animation
skills. Students ,ilso learn the

computer languages of Vbsc ript
and Javascript.
A student at the last level is a
master. Students at this tier are
paired up depending on their
skills. I cants tackle major pro
jec is that c hallenge even the most
accomplished c antpers.
" I here are suc cess stories,"
Beach said. "One that comes in
mind is the first camper at the
MII location. We've seen that in
dividual come up all the way
through our program and attend
the I niversitv of 1 exas. He talks
lor us and lectures for us in [exas
this year."
lite c amp began with two com
puter fanatics, jim Beach and
Doug Murphy, 111 19911. I hey
knew there were others like tlteni
who loved computers as much as
tltev did. 1 hey started the first
camp in the basement of their par
ents homes. I he camp attracts a
ntajoritv <>l males. I he female pop
ulation is relativeh low and only
ten to fifteen percent of the entire
(amp populations are female.
I ,ast vear. AC 1 and the (iarnett
foundation partnered up to give
.111 all-girls camp 101 112 ree. I low ever,
due to lack ot funding, the camp
(oul<l not continue this sunimet.
