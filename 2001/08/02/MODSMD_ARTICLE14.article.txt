Imagine having the opportunity to
purchase something that is tlie best of its
kind in the world ,it less than one-fifth
what everyone else pays. Imagine you
have lour years to take advantage ot this
opportunity as many times as you want.
Doesn't thai sound like a great deal — one
that is too good to pass up? Well, n is avail

Imagine having the opportunity to

Doesn't thai sound like a great deal — one
that is too good to pass up? Well, n is avail
able right here at Stanford to all students.
It's called the Stanford (101l (lourse.
For students, the course is the best bar
gain in the entire game of golf Fora mere

cently ranked Stanford's course 88th in
the world, and Golf Week affirmed this
honor, rating it 01st in tin* country.
Normally, the world's best courses are
exorbitant expensive. I lie famous and
