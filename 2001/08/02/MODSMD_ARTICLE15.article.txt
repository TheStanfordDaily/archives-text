Davenport was certainly the la
voritc heading into her fourth
straight Finals appearance at the

Bank ol the West, having defeated
(llijsters in all lour ol their |>rcvi

meeting bclbre Sunday had been

showdown with Clijsters that
promised to have all the excite
ment of the second set.
but tli.it promise was not kept
on Davenport's end. as the Amer
ican looked to be running on
fumes in the final frame.
Clijsters, who lost a 12-10 third
set tiebreaker to Jennifer Capriati at
this year's French Open finals,
didn't have an epic battle this time
around. Clijsters broke Davenpon
twice to finish off the match with a (>-
I third-set win and to get her name
on the first-place check.
"Today was my fourth final this
year and I'm really happy to win
one at last," said Clijsters, who had
fallen this year in the singles finals
at Roland Carros and Indian
Wells, as well as t he doubles final at
Scottsdale. "1 won a few titles last
year, but this title means more to
me because I've been in the finals
a few times this year but never had
that extra step to finish it off."
"She's a better player than she
was three weeks ago, that's for
sure," said Davenport. "Any
young player will get better the
more experience they get."
