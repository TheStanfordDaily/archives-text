# Behind the mask at Bank of West finals

### 
I went i<> watch the Bank of
the YVt\st tournament ex
erting taut rums. As a casual
observer at Ix-st ol women's
tennis, I had a crude picture ol the
athletes on tour, lorined mostly
from headlines and locker-room
jokes alxwt Anna Kournikova.
I lie image painted by most

sauntered oil to Saturday's semi
finals .tnd Sunday's finals, hop
ing to see the fur lly.
Which is win the weekend was
such .1 slunk. I expected a high
pitched catfiglit; I got Kim ('.li
jsters, Lindsay Davenport, Moni
ca Seles and Meghann Shaugh
ncssy, as intriguing «i study in
(< >ntrasts as you could find in pro
sports today.
Seles is as dose to a grande
dame as you can find todav in
women's tennis, still trucking at
the ripe old age of 27. Int reasing
h hobbled In injury—the Bank
of the West was her first tourna
ment in six months — she is still
eager on the courts, almost quiv
ering in her return stance like a
retrieve! pointing across the net.
Before each point, she shakes
loose with a lew seconds of
bizarre, loot-shaking dame, but
during each point, she moves
strongly and sharply, letting a
trademark grunt fly with every
groundstroke. I lie fans still love
her; during her match with Dav
enport, a torrent of cheers and
'('mon. Monica" shouts [xnired
down every time she showed
signs of fraying.
Unfortunately, those mo
ments came early and often in her
semifinal, lied 2-2 with Daven

port in the first set, Seles' act ura
ey deserted her, and she rail oil .1
string ol iinlbrred errors to Ik'
broken and go down !i-2. Daven
port promptly shut out Seles in
the next game to take a 4-2 lead
.md never looked back.
In the evening, I got my first
glimpse of Meghann Shaugh
nessy, the tournament's largeh
unheralded fifth seed who'd
made headlines by sending
Venus Williams packing in the
quarterfinals. At 5-fbot-l I, 1M
pounds, Shaughnessy lcH»ks im
possibly thin in the middle of a
stadium, almost fragile. She has .1
country-dub feel to most of her
game, unfolding limbs like .1
heron to reach tough shots, pom
tail flopping as she scrambles lot
ward and back. Most of her game
struck me as a bit raw, but then I
saw her serve.
Shaughnessy's illusion ol
fragility disappears during hei
serve; when she tosses the ball up,
she flexes biceps and lats as de
fined as any Nil. wide receiver's.
As she draws her racket back, she
has a moment of total stillness,
pausing as if fora portrait at the
top of the ball's arc. Then, like ,1
roller coaster cresting a hill, she
brings down the hammer.
Shaughnessy regularly broke 1(H)
mph even on her second serves,
and topped out in the match at
KM) with wicked spin.
I he resulting combination ol
frailty and thunder makes
Shaughnessy hard to take youi
eyes oil; she seems equally likely
on any shot to shatter her oppo
nent's racket or to collapse in a
heap, frailty won out Saturday
night, fatigued, perhaps, by the
effort of her three-set win over
Williams the day l)elore and a full
doubles schedule, Shaughnessy
ran down visibly by the end of hei
third set against Clijslers, waving
weakly .it game point as Clijstei*
went up 3-0. By the end of the set,
the indefatigable Clijsters w.is
reaching even Shaughnessy's
nastiest serves; deprived ol hei
greatest weapon, Shaughness\
went down quietly, b-2.

ilia, ilif t>-foot-2 Davenport has al
ways seemed lo steam through the
tour untroubled by the turmoil ol
the teen stars; at 25, she's separated
from the new generation by a lew
years and a level-headed de
meanor. She hasn't particularly
played along with the VVI A's sex|x)t
image, and perhaps because of that
has never attained the |H>pularity

On the court. Davenport has an
unmatched presence. She doesn't

her smoothness and silence make
her seem as if she's hardly work

105 tnpli. Staying mostly on the
baselines in the finals, Davenport
was ruthlessly efficient at times,
moving Clijsters around the court
with surgical precision, lining up
winners like a sniper. In the first
set, she made a rare move to the
net, advancing over the course of
three shots with the inevitability of
Shaq backing into the post, and
finished off the point with a slam as

1 .ike Shaughnessy, though. Dav

hands l>egan to tall into the net late
in the match, and her return game
vanished altogether in the 3rd set.
C.lijsters exploited her op|>onent's
lack of aggression with a daz/ling
array ol drop shots and cross-court
winners, ancl [)aven|K>tl went down
hard, 6-1, in the third.
finally, then, there was only
C.lijsters, the 18-year-old Belgian
who started the year ranked 18th
and has rocketed to fifth in a few
months. I lie youngest of the
semifinalists, she outhustled her
opponents from the first point of
both matches, drawing gasps
from the crowd with her sliding
saves of seemingly unsaveable
points. Indeed, she proudly told
the post match press conference,
with all her skidding and sliding,
she burned a hole clean through
her shoe.
lx>w to the court, stocky, (".li
jsters still moves fluidlv, calves flex

follow-through takes the racket al
most around her head, which
gives her the look of a three-year

she displayed a veteran's court vi
sion and command, placing drops
and lobs with equal expertise. I ler
youth shows through in the occa
sional shanked return, but her en
ergy served her well; she gained

strength as each match wore on,
and buried the field with sheer
speed. The win tor her was com
plete and well-earned, and she
beamed to the crowd afterwards
like a kid at a dance recital.
l oiirsemilinalistN, three niaU lies,

eager on the courts, almost quiv

Before each point, she shakes
loose with a lew seconds of
bizarre, loot-shaking dame, but
during each point, she moves
strongly and sharply, letting a
trademark grunt fly with every
groundstroke. I lie fans still love
her; during her match with Dav

the next game to take a 4-2 lead
.md never looked back.
In the evening, I got my first
glimpse of Meghann Shaugh

unheralded fifth seed who'd
made headlines by sending
Venus Williams packing in the
quarterfinals. At 5-fbot-l I, 1M

struck me as a bit raw, but then I
saw her serve.
Shaughnessy's illusion ol
fragility disappears during hei
serve; when she tosses the ball up,
she flexes biceps and lats as de

As she draws her racket back, she
has a moment of total stillness,
pausing as if fora portrait at the
