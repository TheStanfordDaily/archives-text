# Behind the mask at Bank of West finals
## 
### 
I went i<> watch the Bank of
the YVt\st tournament ex
erting taut rums. As a casual
observer at Ix-st ol women's
tennis, I had a crude picture ol the
athletes on tour, lorined mostly
from headlines and locker-room
jokes alxwt Anna Kournikova.
I lie image painted by most
w< mien's tennis c< >verage is of a cir
cus of coddled teenagers sneering
at each other's clothes and
physiques, shrieking at their
cra/ed lathers, taking injuries and
all hut pulling their opponent's
pigtails — a traveling soap opera,
played out in Spandex.

caine Hnllv vs.

Britney. So I
sauntered oil to Saturday's semi
finals .tnd Sunday's finals, hop
ing to see the fur lly.
Which is win the weekend was
such .1 slunk. I expected a high
pitched catfiglit; I got Kim ('.li
jsters, Lindsay Davenport, Moni
ca Seles and Meghann Shaugh
ncssy, as intriguing «i study in
(< >ntrasts as you could find in pro
sports today.
Seles is as dose to a grande
dame as you can find todav in
women's tennis, still trucking at
the ripe old age of 27. Int reasing
h hobbled In injury—the Bank
of the West was her first tourna
ment in six months — she is still
eager on the courts, almost quiv
ering in her return stance like a
retrieve! pointing across the net.
Before each point, she shakes
loose with a lew seconds of
bizarre, loot-shaking dame, but
during each point, she moves
strongly and sharply, letting a
trademark grunt fly with every
groundstroke. I lie fans still love
her; during her match with Dav
enport, a torrent of cheers and
'('mon. Monica" shouts [xnired
down every time she showed
signs of fraying.
Unfortunately, those mo
ments came early and often in her
semifinal, lied 2-2 with Daven

port in the first set, Seles' act ura
ey deserted her, and she rail oil .1
string ol iinlbrred errors to Ik'
broken and go down !i-2. Daven
port promptly shut out Seles in
the next game to take a 4-2 lead
.md never looked back.
In the evening, I got my first
glimpse of Meghann Shaugh
nessy, the tournament's largeh
unheralded fifth seed who'd
made headlines by sending
Venus Williams packing in the
quarterfinals. At 5-fbot-l I, 1M
pounds, Shaughnessy lcH»ks im
possibly thin in the middle of a
stadium, almost fragile. She has .1
country-dub feel to most of her
game, unfolding limbs like .1
heron to reach tough shots, pom
tail flopping as she scrambles lot
ward and back. Most of her game
struck me as a bit raw, but then I
saw her serve.
Shaughnessy's illusion ol
fragility disappears during hei
serve; when she tosses the ball up,
she flexes biceps and lats as de
fined as any Nil. wide receiver's.
As she draws her racket back, she
has a moment of total stillness,
pausing as if fora portrait at the
top of the ball's arc. Then, like ,1
roller coaster cresting a hill, she
brings down the hammer.
Shaughnessy regularly broke 1(H)
mph even on her second serves,
and topped out in the match at
KM) with wicked spin.
I he resulting combination ol
frailty and thunder makes
Shaughnessy hard to take youi
eyes oil; she seems equally likely
on any shot to shatter her oppo
nent's racket or to collapse in a
heap, frailty won out Saturday
night, fatigued, perhaps, by the
effort of her three-set win over
Williams the day l)elore and a full
doubles schedule, Shaughnessy
ran down visibly by the end of hei
third set against Clijslers, waving
weakly .it game point as Clijstei*
went up 3-0. By the end of the set,
the indefatigable Clijsters w.is
reaching even Shaughnessy's
nastiest serves; deprived ol hei
greatest weapon, Shaughness\
went down quietly, b-2.
fhe finals gave me a better
chance to watch Davenport aftet
her quirk semifinal win. Born
and raised in Southern ('.alilor-
