# Frontcourt will lead for Card

### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
In what looks to be another
grueling and unpredictable sea
son, the Stanford women's basket
ball team's newly released sched
ule has plenty of games for the
team to tune up for Pacific 10 Con
ference play.
A rematch against Tennessee at
Stanford Dec. Hi highlights the
Cardinal's pre-conference sched
ule. Fans in knoxville, Fenn. had
the pleasure last season of seeing
two of college basketball's greatest
active coaches, Tennessee's Pat
Summitt and Stanford's Tat a Van-
Derveer; Stanford fans will have
the favor returned when these leg
ends meet at Maples Pavilion in a
marquee early-season matchup.
Last season, Stanford led the
Volunteers by five | x>ints IK-f< >re get
ting outscored 12-0 during the final
five minutes to lose 58-51 in a heart
breaker. Point guard Susan King,
now a sophomore, was the silver lin
ing in that loss, as she showed the
nation her poise and potential with
a career high 21 points.
The rest of the early schedule
won't be a walk in the park for
Stanford; they'll be tested by In

diana, FC-Santa Barbara and
Western Kentucky at the Stan
ford Tournament Nov. 10-17, as
well .is a road trip to Pepperdine
Nov. 30. T he Cardinal will also
play host lo San Francisco Nov.
28 and Santa Clara Dec. 2, and
then will travel to the Rainbow
Classic in Hawaii Nov. 23-25 be
fore their much-anticipated
meeting with Fennessee.
Fniering the Pac-10 season, the
Cardinal will hopefully have a
more intact lineup than they did
last year.
After King lore her A( T. against
Oklahoma, Stanford, already suf
fering from the devastating retire
ment of sophomore Jamie Carey
due to post-concussion trauma,
was left with no true point guard.
Fnduring perhaps the greatest
test in her storied coaching ca
reer, VanDerveer showed her
flexibility by primarily using
freshman forward Nicole Powell
at the point to gain a share of the
conference title that many
thought would be impossible.
"Of all our Pac-10 champi
onships, this might be the sweetest
one," said VanDerveer after the
Cardinal clinched a share of the
championship during the season's

final weekend.
Because of the return of the
Pac-10 tournament ibis season in
F.ugene, Oregon March 1-4. the
potential for last-weekend dra
matic sin the regular season will be
dampened a bit.
With a healtln King as the floor
general and last season's Pac-10
Freshman of the Year Powell re
turning to her natural forward po
sition. the Cardinal have the po
tential to be as explosive as the
teams of the early 19905.
Powell is a budding superstar,
possessing a daz/ling all-around
game. With five seniors returning
— Cori Fnghusen, Bethany
Donaphin and Lindsey Yamasaki
on the inside and guards Lauren
St. Clair and Fnjoli Izidor on the
perimeter — the Cardinal will
have plenty of experience and tal
ent at every position, which should
make King, Powell, sophomore
Chelsea Frotter and the Cardinal
freshmen better players.
Last year's trying season
should make the (lardinal a men
tally tougher and stronger team
for the Pac-10 season. The Cardi
