If opening weekend figures are
your barometer for judging a movie,
I hen consider "Planet of the Apes" a
smashing success. If you actually go to
the movies expecting a plot, let alone
one that develops and makes sense,
you may be sorely disappointed. A
plotless movie should have been ex
pected from the director of "Pee-
Wee's Adventure," which would have
been a welcome respite from this
nightmarish zoo, but don't argue with
a remake — they make money.
"Planet of the Apes," starring Mark
Wahlberg (NKOTB, "The Perfect
Storm"), Tim Roth ("Rob Roy") and
Helena Ron ham Carter ("Fight
Club"), is a passionless remake of the
19()7 Charlton Heston cult-classic. De
spite his skewed politics, 1 leston could
act, something we can't say for
Wahlberg here. In an ironic twist, the
only real monkey in the movie, Peri
cles. who stars as Wahlberg's co-pilot
and sometimes ape-world quasi-ape
messiah, constantly threatens to up
stage Wahlberg with his acting.
If you don't care about plot and
character development and just want

to set* good battle scenes with humans
incredibly mimicking apes, then this is
your movie. The makeup is magnifi
cent. flawlessly transforming the hu
mans into apes. The setting, a plush
tropical forest and outlying goreous
desert, is another worthwhile aspect of
the movie.
The director, Tim Burton ("Leg
end of Sleepy 1 follow," "Batman") de
livers another visually stunning and
much too dark movie. The sets, cos
tumes and cinematography are won
derful. But they are no match for the
overwhelmingly horrible plot.
Here's what I could gather with

sonic help from the press packet.
Wahlberg is a U.S. Air Force pilot who
helps train monkeys to fly into outer
space. When one of the monkeys dis
appears into an electrical storm,
Wahlberg follows him and disappears
into the same storm. I his storm magi
cally pushes him hack in time, or for
ward — it's never really revealed.
Wherever and whenever Wahlherg
exits the storm, he then plummets
onto a planet and escapes from his pod
only to he overtaken by apes. As he is
running from the pursuant apes, he
