# Favreau's 'Made' so not money, baby
## 
### NADIRA HIRA EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the l)w// hit that Vince Vaughn and Jon
Favreau, who co-starred in the hit "Swingers,"
would appear together again in another "best

friend" lilin,
fans could
hardly contain
their excite
ment. After all,
what could be
better than see
ing the chem
istry of
"Swingers" re
visited — and

undoubtedly refined — bv the two now more ma
ture actors? Just about anything, as it turned out.
"Made," written and directed by Favreau, should
have been this summer's best film — especially consid
ering the competition — but, as former Vice President
Al ( 'K)i e taught a country full of unsuspecting Democ
rats, it is, in fact, possible to botch even the surest of vic
tories with .1 combination of too much confidence and
too little strategy.
Where "Swingers" succeeded with sharp, funny
dialogue and, let's call it, "innovative" syntax,
"Made" fell flat on its face. Vaughn's lines included
so little substance once his asinine repetition of idi
otic phrases and painfully excessive use of the word
"fuck" were accounted for that one would be hard
pressed to identify a purpose for his character, other
than to drive the audience to an irrational and un
founded love for Favreau's character, Bobby.
Of course, in writing Vaughn's Ricky as a less in
telligent Johnny Bravo, Favreau also gained the
added benefit of confusing viewers into accepting —

;ii least lor the duration ol the
film — a plot replete with
cliches, holes and downright itn-,
possibilities.
The film opens with Ricky
and Bohhy in a boxing match,
which leads into some initial
discussion ol Bobby's dream of
becoming a professional boxei
and his plan to establish a \
winning record, as /'
posed to his current 5-5- |
1, fighting Ricky. We
learn that the two spend their
days working at a construction
site, where Bobby is consistent
ly the put-upon hard-worker
and Ricky gets to pretend he's
sweeping as a favor to Bobby
from his oh-so-benevolent
bosses. On the nights when he's

not taking out his passive-ag
gression on Ricky, Bobby finds
himself driving for stripper
\ girlfriend |essica (Famke
/ Janssen ol "X-Men"), against
better judgment of inob
boss benefactor Max, played
Peter Falk.
I { And that's just the bac k
story. This cracked cast oP
characters spends most of the*
film trying to execute a drop
in New York City for
enough money for Ricky t«\ /
be "made" and lor Bobby
buy out lus girlfriend from Max
and send her daughter to pri
vate school. Ricky's lac k of fi
nesse is about as un-L.A. as it |

provides the backdrop for some
ol the film's funniest and most
believable acting, courtesy of

Scan Combs, who plays Manhat
tan gangster Ruiz. Needless to
say, when Puffy — or Puff

— is the highlight of your movie,
it's probably safe to call it a wash.
"Made" really was a film
about small men and big
