### JEREMY KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Don't be caught without a seat
for this one. Stanford Summer
Theatre, raising the bar from last
year's extraordinary "Waiting for
Godot," delivers another riveting
performance with lonesco's com
edy, " The Chairs." Everything
about this performance deserves
praise and, more importantly,
your attendance at one of their
remaining performances.
l he comedy revolves around
an old couple, superbly played by
Geoff Hoyle and Jarek
fruszczynski, who remain alone
and waiting for death on their is
land home. The couple, isolated
physically and emotionally from

people and their pasts, painfully
resort to familiar stories and
games to keep themselves enter
tained. The Old Man (Truszczyn
ski), a retired general of the
army, is put off by the many lost
opportunities of his life and the
ail-too painful familiarity of life.
His wife (Hoyle) prods him to
retell the same story she has
heard every night. Thus are the
seeds of an absurd existential
comedy watered.
What grows out of the initial
investment is a powerful play that
rides through the deeper ques
tions it is trying to answer on the
coat-tails of comedic absurdity.
The actors pull the audience in
with their witty jokes and word
plays until they become quite

comfortable before attacking
their onlookers with their real
purpose — to challenge. This
play is a challenge.
The couple's comic remem
brance degenerates into a wicked
game of make believe. In the
midst of the game, the Old Man
announces that he has invited
everyone he knows, including
the emperor, to a reading in
which he will reveal a plan that
will save the world, however, the
trick is lie will not read it. It will
be read by an orator (Rush
Rehm) because he lacks the ora
tory skills to accurately produce
his thoughts — another missed
opportunity.
The arrival of the guests is a
true masterpiece with the lights

and music coming to life and the
actors displaying their talents.
There are only three actors in the
whole piece, but there are hun
dreds of guests, and the real ac -
tors make believe magnificently.
As more and more guests arrive,
the Old Man and Woman gather
more and more chairs on stage
until the stage and actors are
choked with chairs. Watching
Truszczynski and Hoyle maneu
ver amongst the imagined guests

showcases their acting prowess.
As the room becomes more
crowded, the anticipation for the
orator increases. The ending to
this superb play ends in dramatic
absurdity. You will have to see
the play to learn whether or not
the Orator arrives or if he is a fig
ment of the couple's vivid imagi
nation.
Other highlights in the play
are the set, designed by
Truszczynski, which works won
derfully with the lighting. The di
rection is superb and the music is
gracefully incorporated into the
play. The play will continue its
run at The Little Theater until
Aug. 11. Take your seat for this
one and try not to lose it in your
laughter
