But, regardless, there is some
thing charming and upbeat
about N Sync that makes even
nnisi< snobs, myself included,
take notice. In songs like "Pop"
and the edgy "Up Against 1 lie

sertions that their sound is over
by proving that. In adding a little
urban flair, they can update the
old without losing the sweetness
that 'N Sync fans have come to
know and love, "Gone." bv far

the album's best song, features
I unbet lake's most compelling
balladeering, and it's one the
girls will love to see hitn sing, if
Ins tearful, suit-wearing, pros

was any indication.
And. as might be expected,
"Celebrity" also contains a sizable
serving ol the usual cheerful,
danceable love songs like "Girl-,
friend" and "Just the 2 of Us"
something that should keep
those loyal to the genre happy
and asking for more.
So it's another suet ess story for

J.C., |ustin, Lance, Joey and
(llnis. Apparently, there is
growth to be had, even in the
realm of pop. A word of caution,
though: As 'N Sync explores life
after fiat kstreet, it's important to
remember that people love this
band because it is, after all, a cute
group of good young perform
ers. However, let's hope the boys
recognize and own the fact that,
lor their older audience, their
uncomplicated bubblegum pop
is enjoyable because it is fun, not
because it's innovative, so please
let's not get carried away.

With the shot k ol seeing the Contempt) summer
skank collection behind us, we made short work of
abusing the evening's opening ails, the most no
table of which were Ktleu's ('.rush (WIVs "I'opstai s")
ami Sainantha Mumba, and neither ol whom could

sing, dance or, tor that matter,
keep our attention.
1 his proved to he of little im
port, though, as the boys of
N'Sync took the stage in ,t llurry
of flashing lights and lasers to
perform "Pop," the first single off
their new album. We knew every
word, loved every dance move
and almost kept pace with the
middle-schoolers to our left and
right, all hut forcing our mot ti
lled rock-fiend third guest from
crawling under her chair. All in
all, it provided a lining analogy
for mv feelings about "(lelebrity."
I tan more than sympathize
with those people holding out
hope that, with the rise of bands
like Staind and Linkin Park, we
had seen the end of the boy-band
craze and could breathe easier
knowing the world would be safe
lor music again. And it concerns
me on so many levels ih.it little
girls see a need to tattoo them
selves with song lyrics and glitter,
hoping against hope to catch
Joey or (Chris's eye. (I realize that
almost never happens, but |ustin
and |.C. were getiittg a little too
much airtime).
But, regardless, there is some
thing charming and upbeat
about N Sync that makes even
nnisi< snobs, myself included,
take notice. In songs like "Pop"
and the edgy "Up Against 1 lie
Wall," the l>o\ s address (l it its as
sertions that their sound is over
by proving that. In adding a little
urban flair, they can update the
old without losing the sweetness
that 'N Sync fans have come to
know and love, "Gone." bv far

the album's best song, features
I unbet lake's most compelling
balladeering, and it's one the
girls will love to see hitn sing, if
Ins tearful, suit-wearing, pros
trate performance at the concert
was any indication.
And. as might be expected,
"Celebrity" also contains a sizable
serving ol the usual cheerful,
danceable love songs like "Girl-,
friend" and "Just the 2 of Us"
something that should keep
those loyal to the genre happy
and asking for more.
So it's another suet ess story for

J.C., |ustin, Lance, Joey and
(llnis. Apparently, there is
growth to be had, even in the
realm of pop. A word of caution,
though: As 'N Sync explores life
after fiat kstreet, it's important to
remember that people love this
band because it is, after all, a cute
group of good young perform
ers. However, let's hope the boys
recognize and own the fact that,
lor their older audience, their
uncomplicated bubblegum pop
is enjoyable because it is fun, not
because it's innovative, so please
let's not get carried away.
