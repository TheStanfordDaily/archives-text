# Why won't you stop pushing me around, you big Bully?

Director Larry (Hark is no
stranger t« the trials and tribula
tions ol America's youth, lie
stormed the cinematic world
back in 1995 with the raw and un
forgettable "Kids," a scathing
look at the omnipresence of
drugs, alcohol and sex for teens.
Now with "Bully," Clark has
moved on to a more sensitive
topic — teenage murder.
"Bully" stars Brad Renfro and
Nick Stahl. Renfro, clearly ma
turing after earlier forays in " The
Client" and "Tom and I luck,"
masterfully plays Marty, a surfer
dude who dropped out of high
school and currently has no di
rection in life. His friend Bobby

(Stahl) is mot e at ademu and I us
.ispn at ions ol owning a business.
But .ill is not well in Florida.
Bobby has been abusive — phys
ically, tneniallv and verballv —
with Marty ever since they were
friends in eletnentar) school.
I hen Marty dci ides to light bat k
lor once with the help ol his girl
friend Lisa (Rat hel Miner). Along
with her friends Ali (Bijou
Phillips) and I leather (Kelli (Ear
ner), a gang of sorts is assembled
to take out Bobby. I he question
is whether they have the guts to
do it, and if so, can they get away
with it?
()ne of the people called on to
kill Bobby is a gang hitman,
played by Leo Kit/patrick. For
those ofyou who saw "Kids," Fitz
patrick played one of the main

teens engaging in 1 iskv behavior.
Here, looking much older and
taller, he is the ringleader orches
trating the group's actions given
his prioi experience in gang ac
tivity.
I 'd rank "Bully" somewhere in
between two ol (>l<ti k's pi ior fea
tures, the groundbreaking
"Kids" .ind the grating "Another
Day in Paradise." What elevates
this film above other shock-value
entries is the relevance of teenage
murder today, with Nathaniel
Bra/.ill being only the latest and
most chilling example. Refresh
ingly, you cannot really blame
the parents fora shoddy up
bringing, since the kids in "Bully"
largely have nice cars, nice hous
es and nice clothes.
Unfortunately, "Bully" also

lias, tor iln* mosl part, cardboard
characters. Whether it's the unin
formed parents, the drugged-out
(ouple ot the hitman, these thar
acters simply don't carry the
presence or complexity of Marty
and Bobby. I he film finally picks
up momentum once these thinly
designed teens are faced with
life-altering decisions. Only then
do you see the lack of careful
thought invested into the min
der scheme.
('.lark actually pops up in a
cameo as the hitman's father. As
usual, the parent doesn't get in
volved even when the group of
kids look a bit sketchy. 1 suppose
the message is that moms and
pops should be more involved,
even if the children object. The
parents in "Bully" probably had

no idea that their kids were in
volved in pornography, illicit
drugs, gay bars, murder plots
and rape.
So check out the unrated
"Bully" if you're willing to stom
al ha fairly graphic depiction of a
true story. Or, better yet, make it
a Clark night by renting "Kids"
beforehand.
