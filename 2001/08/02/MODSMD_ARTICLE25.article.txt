Most average people have dreamt
of becoming royally, and given this.
Hollywood kindly indulges (his fain
tale wish ol transformation over and
over again in its movies. As
makeovers and tiaras ( intently spur
the imagination ol more gills than
ho\s, these movie plots often fealuie
.1 plain girl who symbolic ally or liter
ally either enc hauls a pi ince charm
ing or discovers an unexpected royal
lineage. I hen, she inusi overcome
Ikm natural inadequacies to become
beautiful and grateful, as she should
be.
Sound familiar? "The Princess Di
aries" is siu It a storv. Ii depicts Mia
I hermopolis (Anne Hathaway) as .1
nerdy, slt\ high school sophomore
living tit San l-ranc isco with her artsy
mother. She attends a posh private
st hool where the kids lounge on the
lawn 111 theii respective social castes.
I always liked doing that in high
s( hool, too. The occasional classroom
scenes show us Mia's fear of public
speaking, her unpopularity with her
peei sand bet low self-esteem. As she
tells her grandmother, "Mv expecta
tion in life is to become invisible, and
I'm good at it!"
Karly 111 the movie, Mia meets her
absentee granclmothet ( larisse (Julie
Andrews) lot the first time. Mia bum
bles around foolishlv tit the splendor
of the (ienovian Kmbassy, to her
grandmother's discomfort. Mia then
disc overs tli.it (.larisse is the Queen
ol (ienovia and that she is next in line
lot the throne. I lei surprise, excite
ment and eventual anger set the tone
lot the emotional conflic I that under
lies the rest ol litis comedy.
Mia must dec ide il she is willing to
give up her life in San Francisco to as
sume the role of Prim ess of (icnovia.
She takes "princess lessons" while
li ving to control the chaos that en

sues when tlu* public finds out her se
cret. Relationships with her friends,
such as the annoying and indignant
Lilly (Heather Matara/./.o) and the
grungy, potential love interest
Michael (Robert Schwart/man), are
tested .is the normal contusion and
pettiness of high s< hool is magnified.
Mia also struggles to relate to
Clarisse, and their relationship is by
tar more interesting than the rela
tionships with her mother or her
mostly uninteresting friends. Some
thing notable about her friends, how
ever, is that they are activists. Lillv
suggests that Mia should be a
princess because she would have the
power to ailed positive change, and I
appreciated this nod to shaking up
the status-quo.
"The Princess Diaries" invokes a
familiar formula, hm not (o the ex
tent of self-sabotage. In true modern
Disney form, it infuses a fairy tale
with sweet, albeit corny and pre

die table, messages of the importance
of family and true friendship. I
groaned .1 few times at some glaring
ly "touching" moments but also
laughed at the silly jokes and cute an
tics. Mia's challenge to prioritize
friendships and strengthen her char
acter are nothing new, but they save
this lilm from being an extended de
piction of a royal makeover.
Although one will find some tired
(liches and unrealistic scenes, this is a
likable film overall. As a (J-rated
movie intended for family entertain
ment, it accomplishes what it should.
