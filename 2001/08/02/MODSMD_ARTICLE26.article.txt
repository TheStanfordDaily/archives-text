# 'Ray of Sun' vertically challenged by bad script

### RANDY MANO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A lot can happen in one
month. A lot can happen even in
sleepy, tropical Vietnam, the set -
ting of "The Vertical Ray of the
Sim." Writer-director Anh Hung
I ran transports us back to the
lush Asian country following
1993's "I hc Scent of Green Pa
paya." Unfortunately, Iran's
stvle — showcased in both films
— just doesn't click or ring true
lor me, despite the excellent cin
ematography.
"Vertical Ray" closely follows
three sisters during the month
between their mother and fa
ther's deaths. The youngest sis
ter, Lien (Iran Nu Yen-khe),
lives with her brother, Hai
(Quang flai Ngo), in an apart
ment filled with classic American
tunes. In what is perhaps the
most bizarre plot twist, Lien per
sistently wishes to further her re
lationship with Hai, who mostly
brushes aside her advances.
The eldest daughter, Suong
(Mm Quynh Nguyen), is mar
ried to Quoc (Chu Hong). Quoc
is always traveling as a botanical
photographer. His comment
about preferring to shoot plants
over people generates some
humor, which thankfully pops
up from time to time in the most
unexpected places.
Lastly, the middle child,
Rhanh (Le Khanh), had extend-

Ed her vows to Kien, a writer try
ing to finish an unconventional
novel. Unable to break his
writer's block, Kien takes a briel
holiday and completes it else
where. I nsurprisingly, that's not
the only thing th.it lie attended to
during his short vacation.
There's more here than I've
described, but not much more.
I ran has filled the frames with
longing shots into the distance,
ga/es on flora and fauna and
pans on thunderstorm droplets.
Symbolic notions appear and re
turn as if to lend extra credibility
to the proceedings. Spare me,
please.
I really, really wanted to like
"Vertical Ray,' i! only to debunk
the entire "Crouching iiger"
hysteria. Trust me, Asian cinema
has more to offer than flying
martial artists. But this film tails
prey to the ultra-slow-motion dis
ease, a deadly predicament in
this era of rapid-fire assaults. So if
you ignore my words, be pre
pared fora beautiful film lull of
exotic faces, entrancing music
and extremely drawn-out scenes.
