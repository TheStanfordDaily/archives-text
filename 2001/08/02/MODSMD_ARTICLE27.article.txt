## Religion helps science: Alzheimer's study uses nuns

David Snowdon said, "When I visit the
convent it is like visiting grandma's house,

grandmothers."

Former Nun's Tip
Leads to Study
For all the disease's unlotked secrets,
Snowdon did not set out to probe for
dues into Al/heimei 's when he began lus
study at the I niversitv ol Minnesota. In
1980, one of his graduate students who
used to be a nun at a convent a few hours
from campus told him about the aging
sisters living there. Snowdon saw the con
vent as a superb place fora study of the
aging process.
I he benefit of studying .1 religious
order, which Snowdon had done on previ
ous occasions, is that the population of sub
jects is extremely homogeneous compared
with the general populate, thus removing
possible confounding factors. All the nuns,
for example, are non-smokers, single, live
in similar housing, do similar work and
have similar health care.
A further benefit to studying the nuns is
that most prior research on aging had been
done on white, middle-aged men. leaving
out women.
Using the detailed personal records
that the convent maintains, including
short autobiographies written by each
nun upon her entrance into the order.
Snowdon gained insight to the nuns' early
lives. His conclusions after one year sup
ported other studies that indicated a link
between education as a young person and
independence and mental competence as
an old person.
It was only then that the study turned
to Alzheimer's. Experts on the disease in
formed him that the convent was an ideal
place to study Alzheimer's: half of people
over 85 have Alzheimer's, so the aged

population of the convent would be ex
pected to have a significant number of
cases of t he disease.
Subjects in the Nun Studv participated
in annual assessments of their cognitive
and physical function. I 'hey also under
went medical exams.
Perhaps their greatest contribution,
however, was the one most difficult for
Snowdon to request.
A definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's
c an be made 011K after death by examin
ing the brain. This is to see whether the le
sions — senile plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles— present in the cortex of the
brain are sufficient to explain the symp
toms observed during life. I his meant
Snowdon had to ask the nuns to agree to
donate their brains lot autopsies after
their deaths, even though it is still not
known whether lesions are directly re
sponsible for Alzheimer's Disease.
"Another way for my brain
to keep teaching"
Ninety percent of the sisters of the
Mankato, Minnesota convent he first
visited, and ()8 percent ol sisters at all
seven of the convents together, agreed
to Ins request.
" I hey have been educators all their life,
and the studv is. in the words of one of our
panic ipants. 'just another way tor ni\ brain
to keep teaching, even after I have died,'"
Snowdon said.
Dr. |o\ I ay lor. Assistant Direc tor ol the
Stanford VA Aging (Ilinic al Research ( ni
ter. funded l>\ the National Institute on
Aging, sa\s that one of the many ways in
which the Nun Stud\ is significant is in
"raising public awareness about
[Alzheimer's disease] and about the im
portance of brain autopsies."
Fifteen years after it began, the Nun
Study has made significant contributions
to the base of knowledge 011 Mzheimer's.
It has shown that strokes and head trauma
heighten the risk ol suffering from
Alzheimer's, and that intellectual activit\
inav actually provide some defense. It also
suggests that a diet high in folate has a pro
tective influence.
I he study has also suggested that the
language a person uses at a young age may
indicate her susceptibility to Alzheimer's in
old age. fhis com lusion is based on exam
ination of the short autobiographies writ
ten by the nuns upon their entrance into
the order fifty or more years earlier.
Snowdon and University of Kansas
Psychology Prof. Susan Kemper found
that, in general, the autobiographies of
sisters now exhibiting Alzheimer's had a
lower "idea density," or number of dis
tinct ideas per number of words, and a
lower grammatical complexity than the
autobiographies of sisters who did not ex
hibit Alzheimer's.
Snowdon also found that the nuns
who displayed more positive emotions
— such as contentment, love, and grati
tude — in their early writing enjoyed a

longer life span than counterparts who
were not as positive.
The Human Side
For all its good science, though, I lit*
Nun Study is just as renowned for its
unique human aspect. One of the condi
tions the holy order set for Snowdon when
he approached them about the study was
that he must not treat them as mere re
search subjects, but must get to know
them. This went against the convention of
scientific detachment.
Snowdon, who attended Catholic
school as a child, said, "In many ways, the
nuns remind me of the inhabitants of
Buddhist temples I have visited over the
years" in Asia.

"While some (Catholics may remember
their grade school teachers in the 1960's
.is being serious and intense, the sisters 1
know now are very bright, compassion
ate, and loving women. There is a spirit
in the convent that transforms its visi
tors. When 1 take the press or my col
leagues to tlu- convent, the nuns turn
them into silly putty."
The combination of news on
Alzheimer's with the spirituality and hu
manity of the nuns made the Nun Study
a favorite topic of the media after Snow

language a person uses at a young age may
indicate her susceptibility to Alzheimer's in

Snowdon and University of Kansas
Psychology Prof. Susan Kemper found
that, in general, the autobiographies of
sisters now exhibiting Alzheimer's had a
lower "idea density," or number of dis
tinct ideas per number of words, and a
lower grammatical complexity than the
autobiographies of sisters who did not ex
hibit Alzheimer's.
Snowdon also found that the nuns
who displayed more positive emotions
— such as contentment, love, and grati

longer life span than counterparts who
were not as positive.

that he must not treat them as mere re

Former Nun's Tip
Leads to Study
For all the disease's unlotked secrets,
Snowdon did not set out to probe for
dues into Al/heimei 's when he began lus
study at the I niversitv ol Minnesota. In
1980, one of his graduate students who
used to be a nun at a convent a few hours
from campus told him about the aging
sisters living there. Snowdon saw the con
vent as a superb place fora study of the
aging process.
I he benefit of studying .1 religious
order, which Snowdon had done on previ
ous occasions, is that the population of sub
jects is extremely homogeneous compared
with the general populate, thus removing
possible confounding factors. All the nuns,
for example, are non-smokers, single, live
in similar housing, do similar work and
have similar health care.
A further benefit to studying the nuns is
that most prior research on aging had been
done on white, middle-aged men. leaving
out women.
Using the detailed personal records
that the convent maintains, including
short autobiographies written by each
nun upon her entrance into the order.
Snowdon gained insight to the nuns' early
lives. His conclusions after one year sup
ported other studies that indicated a link
between education as a young person and
independence and mental competence as
an old person.
It was only then that the study turned
to Alzheimer's. Experts on the disease in
formed him that the convent was an ideal
place to study Alzheimer's: half of people
over 85 have Alzheimer's, so the aged

population of the convent would be ex
pected to have a significant number of
cases of t he disease.
Subjects in the Nun Studv participated
in annual assessments of their cognitive
and physical function. I 'hey also under
went medical exams.
Perhaps their greatest contribution,
however, was the one most difficult for
Snowdon to request.
A definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's
c an be made 011K after death by examin
ing the brain. This is to see whether the le
sions — senile plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles— present in the cortex of the
brain are sufficient to explain the symp
toms observed during life. I his meant
Snowdon had to ask the nuns to agree to
donate their brains lot autopsies after
their deaths, even though it is still not
known whether lesions are directly re
sponsible for Alzheimer's Disease.
"Another way for my brain
to keep teaching"
Ninety percent of the sisters of the
Mankato, Minnesota convent he first
visited, and ()8 percent ol sisters at all
seven of the convents together, agreed
to Ins request.
" I hey have been educators all their life,
and the studv is. in the words of one of our
panic ipants. 'just another way tor ni\ brain

Snowdon said.
Dr. |o\ I ay lor. Assistant Direc tor ol the

which the Nun Stud\ is significant is in
