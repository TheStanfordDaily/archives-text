# Choking on chicken: a culinary investigation
## 
### SARAH MEARON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Almost 10 years ago, I got my first job as
a take-out girl at tlu* local Swiss Chalet, a
popular (lanadian chain restaurant. II the
take-out counter wasn't busy, one of my
duties was to peel soggy meat oil cold car
casses ih.it had been sitting in the "chick
en drawer" too long alter being barbe
cued on the- infamous('.lialet spit. Despite
the revolting nature of the work, I contin
ued to eat .it the Chalet. (My stomach was
much stronger back then).
For my millennium New Year's reso
lution. I became a vegetarian. But just a
year-and-a-half later, I started to won
der why 1 had given up eating animal
flesh. And the more 1 thought about it,
the harder it was to come up with a
good answer. And the harder it was to
come up with a good answer, the more
my mouth watered at the thought of
licking the bones of a tasty, marinated
birdie. So ever since 1 rescinded vege
tarianism a couple of months ago, I
have been gobbling up c hie ken at every
opportunity.
()n Sunday, my boyfriend Brent and I
visited Firecracker, a Chinese restaurant
in the Mission. Brent reminded me that
the first time we dined at Firecracker —
which happened to be our first date — I
brazenly announced that I was a "veg
gie-saurus." But this time, I gladly
scarfed down the house specialty. Fire
cracker chicken.

Don't give me an M! Or an S! Or a (i!
Many people assume that Chinese food
is the main source for MSC (monosodium
gltitamate). However, MSC can be found
in almost every processed food on the mar
ket. commonly disguised .is a component
ofautolyzed yeast, whey protein or gelatin.
In its natural form, it is found in many
plants and animals as 1.-glutamic acid.
After factory processing, it is refined to a
white crystalline substance called MSC..
Many people suffer from headaches
after consuming MSC. 1 'his occurs be
cause MSC is a neurotoxin that tricks the
brain into believing that the food being
eaten tastes better than it actually does, al
lowing lood manufacturers to use lower
quality ingredients.
(her time, brain cells die and more se
rious conditions may develop, such as
schizophrenia and heart palpitations.
MSC is found in everything from c rac k
ers and soda to corn flakes and tooth
paste. So quit using chic ken < how inein as
a scapegoat.
Want some chicken with that grease?
The worst thing you can do when
you're hungry is go grocery shopping.
Unfortunately, that is just what happened
to me last week. While standing in the
frozen lood aisle ol Albertson's, 1 had a
sudden craving for 112 ried chicken — which
is where a Hungry Man dinner came in.
One breaded breast and a half-c up of re
constituted mashed potatoes later, I was
regretting it.

When food is
deep-fried, the
oil is at about
365 degrees.
File sizzling
sound heard
when food is
immersed in
the oil is the
sound of water

instantly vapor
izing as ii leaves the food alter contacting
the oil. With the water gone, a crispy
outer t rust is formed.
So why is it that we gel sick lo our stom
achs after eating fried foods? When ( (Hik
ing oil is heated, many chemical reactions
occur within it - the products of which ei
ther escape as gases or remain in the oil.
I hose that remain include free fatty
acids, which are toxic and therefore (ause
indigestion.
To make your own fried ( hicken, com
bine flour, salt and pepper in a howl. Dip
chicken pieces in milk and then coal
them heavily in the Hour mixture. In a
heavy skillet, melt lard so there is a lialf

Hummus is as hummus does
Saturday found us rn the llaight for
Mediterranean food at k.ui /aman. In be

dined on cucumber salad,
baba ghanoush and tasty
chicken maza. When the belly
dancers performed — as
charming as they were — they
reminded me of my thesis ad

research proposals, she dab

seemingly endless thesis

work. But a couple glasses of
wine later, those worries evaporated.
folks who live around the Mediter
ranean have been shown, at various times,
to have among the lowest rates of chronic
diseases and the highest life expectancies,
which has increased interest in the so
c.illed traditional Mediterranean-style
diet. I'he diet emphasizes plant-sourced
food, minimally processed and seasonally
fresh foods, low to moderate amounts of
fish, poultry .uicl cheeses, as well as low
amounts ol red meat, saturated fats and
high-sugar foods.
I lie diet also involves keeping total fat
between 25 and 35 percent of daily c alo
ries and limiting intake of saturated I.it to
7-.S percent. I lie key idea behind the diet
is to keep the proportion of plant - to ani
mal-based foods high.
Moreover, the diet emphasizes the al
most exclusive use of olive oil as the main
cooking fat. ()live oil lias been praised for
its high oleic .u id content - a inoiiouns.it
urated fatty acid that lowers levels of
"bad" cholesterol, while protecting

Almost 10 years ago, I got my first job as
a take-out girl at tlu* local Swiss Chalet, a
popular (lanadian chain restaurant. II the
take-out counter wasn't busy, one of my
duties was to peel soggy meat oil cold car
casses ih.it had been sitting in the "chick
en drawer" too long alter being barbe
cued on the- infamous('.lialet spit. Despite
the revolting nature of the work, I contin
ued to eat .it the Chalet. (My stomach was
much stronger back then).
For my millennium New Year's reso
lution. I became a vegetarian. But just a
year-and-a-half later, I started to won
der why 1 had given up eating animal
flesh. And the more 1 thought about it,
the harder it was to come up with a
good answer. And the harder it was to
come up with a good answer, the more
my mouth watered at the thought of
licking the bones of a tasty, marinated
birdie. So ever since 1 rescinded vege
tarianism a couple of months ago, I
have been gobbling up c hie ken at every
opportunity.
()n Sunday, my boyfriend Brent and I
visited Firecracker, a Chinese restaurant
in the Mission. Brent reminded me that
the first time we dined at Firecracker —
which happened to be our first date — I
brazenly announced that I was a "veg
gie-saurus." But this time, I gladly
scarfed down the house specialty. Fire
cracker chicken.

Don't give me an M! Or an S! Or a (i!
Many people assume that Chinese food
is the main source for MSC (monosodium
gltitamate). However, MSC can be found
in almost every processed food on the mar
ket. commonly disguised .is a component
ofautolyzed yeast, whey protein or gelatin.
In its natural form, it is found in many
plants and animals as 1.-glutamic acid.
After factory processing, it is refined to a
white crystalline substance called MSC..
Many people suffer from headaches
after consuming MSC. 1 'his occurs be
cause MSC is a neurotoxin that tricks the
brain into believing that the food being
eaten tastes better than it actually does, al
lowing lood manufacturers to use lower
quality ingredients.
(her time, brain cells die and more se
rious conditions may develop, such as
schizophrenia and heart palpitations.
MSC is found in everything from c rac k
ers and soda to corn flakes and tooth
paste. So quit using chic ken < how inein as
a scapegoat.
Want some chicken with that grease?
The worst thing you can do when
you're hungry is go grocery shopping.
Unfortunately, that is just what happened
to me last week. While standing in the
frozen lood aisle ol Albertson's, 1 had a
sudden craving for 112 ried chicken — which
is where a Hungry Man dinner came in.
One breaded breast and a half-c up of re
constituted mashed potatoes later, I was
regretting it.

When food is
deep-fried, the
oil is at about
365 degrees.

when food is
immersed in
the oil is the
sound of water
