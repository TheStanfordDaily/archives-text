I recentb had an extraordinary < \-
perieutcon ilk- Inteinet, and I want i<>
tell yon about it (I am, of com sc. not t e
ferring to cvbersex. and by the wav. .i
recent survey by .i Stanford-affiliated
researcher found that cyberscx takes
up nun li less time in people's lives than
previously thought).
fhe other day, I was eating at an I I
Salvadoran restaurant in Redwood ( its
with some friends, and we started to
discuss a great but long forgotten book
1 had read when I was a kid about .i boy
who runs away to the ('.atskill Moun
tains in New York and adopts <i pere
grine falcon.
A couple ol days later. I was sitting in
my apartment and decided that I want
ed to re-read that novel, which had
been one of my favorites in grade
st hool, bat k when I still read for fun. So
I entered "M\ Side of the Mountain."
the title of this novel, on YahooTs
search engine, and the results realb
made me think about how wired we are
as a sot iety today.
1 lie first result I found was. as
toundinglv, the official Web sile of the
author of "My Side of the Mountain,"
|ean Craighead Ceorge. I laughed he
cause for some reason, just the idea I hat
the author of this random book I had
read as a little kid had an "official" Web
site was verv amusing to me.
I clicked on the hyperlink, went
through the Web site, and learned and
re-remembered a great deal about "\l\
Side of the Mountain" and its author. I
re-remembered that "M\ Side of the
Mountain" was a Newbem Honor
Book — the fact that ii had a shim
image of the Newberry medal on its
cover was probably the reason wh\ an
impressionable Asian kid like mysell

had puked up the book oil the shell at
tin local public library.
I reali/ed that I had read the sequel
ol "M\ Side ot the Mountain." "()n the
far Side of the Mountain." lo iu\ as
tonishment, I learned that "On the far
Side of the Mountain" was at tuallv writ
ten some tliu ty years after the original,
the l ( .>f>o Newberrv Honor Hook.
Even more surprisingly, I learned
that this set les was actually a trilogy —
"It ightlul's Mountain" was the third
book in the series, written from the
point of view ol Frightful, the pere
grine falcon tli.it the protagonist ol the
first two novels adopts.
fhe fact that I found all this by ( lit k
ing a mouse on the computer in my
apartment made me think hard about
how technology has brought the world
to me. II not lor the Internet, I proba
bly would have been too lazy to go look
up "My Side of the Mountain" at a li
brarv. and I t erlainb would not have
discovered this wealth ol information.
Now that I have found this informa
tion, it's faitb likely that I will go read
" I- right fill's Mountain" at some point.
1 he next thing I did on my comput
er was to scan h for the Web site of the
Orange County, California public li
brarv system, to see if I could find out
the status of the book; I want to check
out the book again when I go home in
September.
I was curious to see if Orange (loun
t\ libraries had a presence on the Net.
1 remembered that as I was growing
up, the ways in which I could search
for books at my local library had be
come better and faster over time.
When I first went to the library as a
second-grader upon immigrating
from Hong Kong. I still had to use the
card-catalog to find books. 1 hen. the
