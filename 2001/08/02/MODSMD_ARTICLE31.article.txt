## Europa gets a life (maybe) 
### CHARLES FENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ii Ii;ls l>een suggested that Mars is no longer
the only orbiting Ixxly in (he solar system that
ina\ harlxn* extraterrestrial life. Evidence sug
gests that Europa — one of Jupiter's moons —
mav also contain the necessary ingredients for
sustaining lite.
Christopher Cliyba, an associate professor
of geological and environmental sciences, is an
exobiologist who devotes some of his time to
figuringout exactly what these ingredients are.
Previous data gathered from the Calileo
spacecraft suggests that Europa containsaliq
uid water ocean — and liquid water is an es
sentia component of life. Moreover, the space
craft provided data that demonstrate that Eu
ropa likely has elements necessary lor the for
mation of life. Scientists now have to determine
a viable energy source for any living organisms
on the moon.
"Photosynthesis is not an option on Europa
because the ocean there is probably covered by
10 km of iceChyba said.
According to Chyba, life on Earth combines
112 uels and oxidants—much in the same way an
automobile pnxesses gasoline — and har
nesses energy from the resulting chemical re
action. Whereas multicellular life combines
organic molecules with molecular oxygen, sin
gle-celled bacteria and archea can use a much
larger variety of oxidants, including sulfates
and nitrates.
A commonly held misconception is that mi
croorganisms existing in harsh conditions on
earth — such as in hydrothermal vents — can
Ik- used as evidence for life on an ocean-con
taining heavenly body like Europa.
" That's kind of misleading because many of
die organisms that reside at hydrothermal
events directly or indirectly deperid 011 the oxy
gen that's produced at the surface of the
earth," Chyba said.
Since the liquid water layer of Europa is cov
ered by a large mass of ice, it is impossible for
photosynthesis — which splits water into oxy
gen and hydrogen — to occur. Therefore, an
other form of energy production is necessary
in order for Europa to sustain life.
Recent research done by Chyba and
Kevin 1 land, a graduate student in mechan
ical engineering, supports the notion that ra
diation could Ik* the main mechanism by
which oxygen is produced on Europa. Their
work was published in the June 15 issue of
Science magazine.
"We were looking fora source of chemi
cal disequilibrium, which would drive chem
ical reactions in the opposite direction,"
Chyba said.
One source of radiation is attributed to
c harged particles that are act elerated onto En
ropa's surface by Jupiter's |>owerful magnetic
field. Another source is the decay of radioactive
elements — particularly potassium-40.
"When the potassium-40 decays, it produces
gamma rays and lieta particles," C Ihvba said. "And
when it decays, it breaks up water molecules into
oxygen and hydrogen."

Sin c e
some mi-

croorganisms
am make energy from

water s separated com- |
ponents, hydrogen and
oxygen are a potential
source of fuel on Kuropa.
(Uiyba and I land look
their research one step 112 ur
ther by estimating (lie bio
mass that a radiation-driven
energy source would lx' able

to produce. Based on calcu- |
lations, a considerable
amount oflite—on the order
of 1010 to 1014 g per year —
could lie supported.

Although Chyba's research
supports (lit* hypothesis that
life resides on Europa, Mars is
still a strong candidate lor sup
porting lite.
" There's good evidence
that water once flowed on

Mars' surface," Chyba said. "So
you can imagine the origins of
lite happening on Mars as it did
on Earth."
But ('.hyba believes that study
ing Europa is just as important as
investigating Mars.

"Unfortunately, [Europa is] a k>t
harder lo get to and the result is that
we're only going to get to it once a
decade if we're lucky," he said.
Chyba, as the chair of the Science
Definition Team for the Europa Or-

biter mission, was head of a team that
determined the scientific objectives
fora Europa spacecraft that will hope
fully launch in 2008.

"Its first objective is to determine - beyond a
shadow of doubt - whether there is really an
ocean there," Chyba said.
With a payload of scientific instruments
weighing only 40 pounds, the Europa Orbiter
will ideally reach Jupiter in 2011.1 lowever, be
cause of recent failures of the Mars landers,
some estimates tor the costs for the Europa
mission now exceed $1 billion.
" There's a real chance the date could slipl)e
yond 2008," Chyba said.
As for the possibility of intelligent life in the
universe, (lie search is just fx'ginning. At the
SF I I Institute in Mountain View, where
Chyba holds the Carl Sagan Chair for the
Study of Life in the Uni verse .'sdentists are cur
rently looking for radio signals from thousands
of nearby stars. After the completion of the In
stitute's privately funded Allen Telescope
Array in 2005 — a complex aggregate < >fsmall
er telesco|>es — scientists will Ik 1 able to search
for signals fi otn the closest million stars.
" That is still 1/1000 of one percent of the
stars in the galaxy," Chyba said.
To put things in perspective, there
are about a hundred billion galaxies in
the universe.
