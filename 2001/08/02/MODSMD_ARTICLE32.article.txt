# Got chronic pain? Let iMRI fix you up for good

Researchers at Stanford Medical (-en
ter's Pain Management Center have de
veloped a new method of treating chronic
pain using open-air interventional mag
netic resonance imaging. Dr. Sean Mack
ev, .111 assistant professor of anesthesiolo
gy .it Stanford Medical Center, uses iMRI
to deliver regional anesthesia to terminal
1\ ill patients.
I lie iMRI unit has an open-magnet de
sign that allows a physician and a radiolo
gist to stand between the two magnet
units, on either side of a patient, and look
inside a patient's body while giving a pain
killing injection.
"The beauty of iMRI is that the whole body
is laid open for us," Mackey said. "We can see
.ill the solt tissue structures, all the bones, .ill
the organs. So we know exactly where the nee
dle is going. We know exactly where the med
ication is that we're injecting."
Many terminally ill cancer patients suf
fer from pain that cannot be treated by
drugs alone. In such cases, Mackey per
forins a "nerve block," an injection into 01
around a nerve so that 'he nerve no longer
transmits pain.
"What we'll do is actually inject a neu
rolitic substance, something that will ac
tually go in and kill those nerves, and it
usually kills them for about one to two
years and can provide some very pro

found benefit," Mackey said. A local
anesthetic, which may be combined
with cortisone, provides temporary re
lief; Alcohol or phenol is used for longer
lasting pain relief. I bis allows terminal
ly ill patients to spend their last days in

relative comfort, Mackey explained.
Using the iMRI, Mat key is able to per
form nerve blocks in cases when conven
tional treatment has failed or is deemed
too risky, due to a patient's distorted
anatomy from cancer or obesity. I he new
method allows a physician to observe the

depth and precise trajectory ol the needle,
which permits better control over distrib
ution ol the pain medication.
"We are currently administrating
the injections to patients on a small
scale. I have performed approximately

25 to date and ex
pect to be expand
ing the number,"
Mackey said. "[ln
the future], I expect
these capabilities of
MRI to perforin
functional imaging
— blood flow, oxy
genation. tempera
ture — to allow us to
better direct thera
pies and immediate
ly see the conse
quences of them."
iMRI-assisted in
jections, which take be
tween 45 minutes and
two and a ball hours,
costs between five hun
dred and several thou-

sand dollars, and are generally c overed by
health insurance and not any more expen
sive than alternative treatments.
Traditional treatments for chronic pain
include neurologic intervention, a type of
surgery that involves implanting time-re
lease devices that deliver local medication

slowly over time. In another type of
surgery, a neurosurgeon either cuts a
nerve close to the spinal cord or cuts bun
dles of nerves in the spinal cord itself . An
other treatment involves electric stimula
tion. in which mild electric currents are ap
plied to selec ted areas of the skin by a small
power pack connec ted to two electrodes.
fast methods for administering pain
killing injections relied on the use of x-rays,
and the so-called "blind" technique, where
the doctor literally guesses where to inject
the drug.
Mackey developed the use of iMRI in
collaboration with Dr. Daniel Sze of the
Stanford Radiology Department.
" This project would not be possible
without the collaborative help of Dr. Sze
and the Department of Radiology," Mac k
ey said. "It is only through our combined
expertise and efforts that this application
of advanced imaging to treating chronic
pain could have wcurred."
Recently, Mac key received funding for
his research project, titled "Processing of
Pain in the Human Cervical Spinal Cord:
Analysis Through Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging," from Stanford's Of
fice of Technology Licensing's Research In
centive Fund.
Although several major medical centers
now possess the open MRI system, only
Stanford is currently using the device to
treat c hronic pain.
