# Coochie-coo: talking to babies boosts language skill

### JULIEN CAPERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researcher Patricia Kulil presented
some of her findings at a "Ready to Read,
Ready to Learn" conference hosted by
111st Lady Laura Bush. At the George
town event, Kulil presented her claim that
tlie fundamental acquisition of language
.is an infant plays an important role in a
child's ability to learn more complex
skills. Infants who are better at distin
guishing the phonetic building blocks of
speech exhibit a better ability to apply

these skills to advanced language ap
plications, such as reading.
Well before they are able to

talk, children acquire a large
body of knowledge about lan
guage. Kulil asserts that iu
f.uiis — even moments after
birth — are able to differenti
ate between consonant and
vowel sounds in any language.
I he difficult part for children is
recognizing which sounds art

important to the language they are
immersed in — a process that gener-

ally takes about 1 2 months. I his process is
sped along by the deliberate and exagger
ated language adults use when speaking
to children. Known as "motherese" or
"parentese," it has been proven to help
i hem learn.

I he "Ready to Read, Ready to Learn"
conference was designed to promote the
enhancement of learning techniques for
reading improvement for children. Kulil
hopes that her research will provide in ear
lier recognition of potential reading prob
lems in children, allowing problems to be
addressed at an early stage of development.

Experts hope
parents will not use this information*to
push their children prematurely, but
rather to ensure every child's fulfillment of
his potential.

In the p.ist, authenticating artwork h.is
been an extremely difficult t.isk requiring .1
vast knowledge of art and artists, as well as
a keen eye for fraud. In the last few
decades, chemists and physit ists have been
working at making the process a little easi
er. Using < heniistry, .1 group from the lab
oratory for Crystallography at the Univer
sity of Amsterdam has found .1 new way to
verify the authenticity of art.

Throughout time, artisans have
looked for pigments non-toxic
pigments. Between the Kith
and 20th centuries, the use
of a lead / antimony pig
ment known as Naples Yel
low became popular. I lie
