Enjoy Heritage on the Hoof with your Whole Family
This Red Barn is a historic
reminder of where it began.
Years before there was a
world-famous Stanford
University, there was Leland
Stanford's Palo Alto Stock
Farm, the home of nine world
champions and 30 world
records.
This wonderfully restored
Victorian beauty is a symbol
of Leland Stanford's zest for
research and excellence.
Around its historic track
Eadwarde Muybridge's first
zoetrope pictures inspired the
D IRECTIONS
film industry. And decades
later the young geniuses of the
university turned silicon sand
into cold and led the
technology revolution.
Come spend a day at The
Farm. Watch beautiful animals
and athletes jump and parade
and prance through their
exhibitions. We've got polo
and pony rides, petting zoos
and oarbecues, too. Come
celebrate the excitement and
the heritage of the Red Barn
Festival. Get the dust of history
on your boots.
On the Stanford Campus. Take
Junipero Serra Blvd. to Campus
Drive West to Electioneer Road.
