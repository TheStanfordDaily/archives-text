Stanford professoi Bernard Widrow has developed
a nii( rophotie arra\ necklace, known .ls Directional
I (earing Arrav, tli.it allows those with severe 01 pro
lonnd luai ing loss to heat Wit (row developed the de
\i< e. which first .ippeared as a prot( Â»tvpe in I ( in ("(in
junction with two graduate students.
I sing six tinv microphones, the Y -shaped net klacc
captures sound from a (Hi-degree wide, cone shaped
area in front of the user. Because otil\ those sounds
coming in from vei tical and horizontal t>o degree angles
are captured hy the instrument, the usei orients his 01
her Ixxh toward desiralile sound and e\(ess noise is re
duced, Widrow explained. Signal processing chips
within the device receive the input sounds and ainplih
conversational sound while muting excess noise. I lie
optimized signal is then convened into a magneti( sig
nal and wirelessly transmitted to a telecoil in the usei s
hearing aid. I lie effect is clearer conversational tones
and reduced extraneous noise.
In a noisy environment, it is extremely (liflic wit fora
hearing-impaired |XTson to ((inverse as hearing aids
amplify background sounds as well as conversation,
Widrow said.
In an environment with only two people, the listen
er experiences reverberations of sound resulting from
the many pathways it takes Ix-fore it reaches him or her.
"The sound goes directly in a straight line to the lis
tener hut also reflects off of walls, the ceiling, and the
floor. It takes so many pathways that one would lie
amazed," he said. "The reflected sound is heard multi
ple times and slightly later Ixrauseot the many, longer
pathways, lliis is the effect of revet I K-ration, which ran
make hearing quite difficult."
Widrow has spent much of his career developing the
concepts of adaptive signal processing and neural net
works. which are used by the necklace. 'Hiedevice's sig
nal processing chips employ adaptive signal processing
to assign weights to different input sounds based on the
least mean squared computer algorithm.

Widrow and
inventoi led
I 101l developed
the LSM .il^(>
rithin. which re
duces noise it 1 an
elect roni( signal,
in 1959. The
weights deter
mined by the
LSM algorithm
determine wlik li
sounds arc ampli
fied and which
sounds, stub as

e( hoes and othei noise, are muted. Neural networks are
engineering systems that learn from experience; its ap
plications iii( lude recognition ol speech and patterns.
I'lic necklace has Ixvn designed to aid the nearly 2
million people in the I nited States that suffer severe to
profound heat ing loss.
Recently. Widrow has lx*en performing trials on
Stanford and los Altos residents. "I've tested it on two
Stanford students and some faculty." Widrow said.
"I'm currently writing the user manual, so it helps to
see how the) use and respond to the device."
( ordinal Research I,IXI, of which Widrow is chair
man. produced earlier models of the device. Although
no company currently produces them, Starkey 1 labora
tories of Minnesota has agreed to manufacture the de
vices in the future il Widrow can find someone to mar
ket them.
Widrow was inducted into the National Academy of
Engineering in 1 ( .>95, and is a I .ife Fellow of the institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. I le has received
lEEE's ('.cntennial Medal, Alexander (>raham Hell
Medal and Neural Networks I'ioneer Medal.
In Mav, Widrow was awarded the 2001 Benjamin
Franklin award m engineering. I (e joined the Stanford
faculty in 1959 after receiving his bachelor's, master's
and doctoral degrees from MIT.
