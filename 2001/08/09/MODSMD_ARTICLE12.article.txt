# Students may face expulsion
## 
### TINA BAO CELENE CHAN 
Following the June 29 arrest of three Stanford
students, the campus judicial Affairs Office is in the
process of determining if the students violated the
Fundamental Standard.
The Fundamental Standard states "students at
Stanford are expected to show f>oth within and without
the University such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to do this will fx- sufficient cause
for removal from the University."
Sophomore Christopher Thomas Pumo and re
cent graduates Mm at Coksel, 23, and Berra Yazar,
22, face the possibility of being expelled.
Pumo faced the severest charge with several
counts of drug sales and possession. Istanbul native
Coksel was charged with three counts of drug sales.
Yazar, of Los Altos, was alleged with two counts of
drug sales.
The three were arrested following an undercov
er police officer's drug purchase at the student's Es
condido Village residence. Stanford Police, in con
junction with the Palo Alto Police and Santa Clara
County Drug Task Force, conducted a three
month investigation into the drug sales. Drugs dis
covered in the dorm include Ecstasy, nitrous oxide,
hashish and psilocybin mushrooms.
The case was subsequently turned over to the Ju
dicial Affairs Office to investigate.
"To protect the confidentiality of all those in
volved, once a matter is turned over to Judicial Af
fairs we do not comment further," Judicial Affairs
Advisor Laurette Beeson said.
Beeson explained how the process will be carried

out by the Office: the student first meets with the
Judicial Advisor to hear the details of the concern
and review the Student Judicial Charter.
They also review their rights and responsibilities
under the charter.
"Each investigation is unique, depending on the
student's response to the allegation and the type of
evidence and/or number of witnesses involved,"
Beeson added.
At the end of the investigation the Judicial Offi
cer must determine if there is sufficient evidence to
formally charge the student with a violation of the
Honor Code or other student conduct policies,
such as the Fundamental Standard.
If the Judicial Officer decides there is insufficient
evidence to sustain a charge, then no further action
is taken. If the Judicial Officer determines there is
sufficient evidence, then a formal charge letter is is
sued and a Judicial Panel hearing is arranged.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the panel mem
bers deliberate and decide whether there is suffi
cient evidence to hold the student responsible for
violating the Honor Code or Fundamental Stan
dard. The panel has the authority to dismiss the
case, find that no violation occurred, or find that a
violation did occur. The vote must be at least 5-1.
All sanctions must be reviewed by the Dean of
Students for consistency with the Penalty Code and
past practice or precedent. Although the Dean is
not authorized to alter sanctions, the Dean may ask
the same Judicial Panel to reconsider them.
The reconsidered decision of the Panel is final. If
expulsion a recommended sanction, the case must
be reviewed by the Provost, who may concur in the
recommendation or impose lesser sanctions.
