most made me pee my pants. One

snippet ran:
"Well. |ohn, that nunilx*r 52, he

"You're sure right, Mill. Also,
when that (iollins fellow throws, he
needs to make sure he gets it to the
receivers, not to the Ravens."
"Kxcellent point. John. When he
does that, the Ravens get the ball."
I hey sure do, Hill. They
couldn't have the hall mote than

they do at that moment. I heir ball

You can't make this stuff up. You
