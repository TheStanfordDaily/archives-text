problem. F.ven before the curtain
rises, there is something to ad

felt makes its way towards the ()i -

not look forward to its return.
"AIDA" is the story of a Nu
bian princess who is captured by
Fgyptian soldiers and brought to
Fgvpt as a slave. Radames
(played by Patrick Cassidy), the
Fgyptian captain who captures
Aida, notes her unusual spunk
with surprise and finds himself in
love with her. 1 his turns out to be
a rather bad idea: Radames is be
trothed to Princess Amneris
(played by kelli Fournier) and,
by his father's design, is in line for
the throne. Aida (Simone) is
caught in a bind as well and must
choose between the captain and
the freedom of her people.
This Shakespeare-like plot
supports a well-rounded musical.
Simone provides the audience
with a captivating performance,
filling her roll with extraordinary
enthusiasm. Kelly Fournier is
charming, funny, beautiful and

the other hand, is at times un
bearably Hat and Ins acting is no
match for his co-stars.
Behind this triangle of star
crossed lovers lies a no-expense
spared Disney production. As a
result, the sets are elegant and ef
fective, and many of the costumes
are downright enthralling. I lie
first at t even itu ludes a short but
fantastic fashion show. 1 he comic
elements are well thought out as
well, although more than once it
felt like the writers had included
jokes just to till a void in the plot.
I o top it off, the coreogtaphv is
provocative, although occasion
ally the dancing is somewhat
reminiscent of a music video.
Unfortunately, the most
promising part of the musical was
also the most dissapointing.
Klton John and Inn Kid- failed to
deliver a heart-stopping score.
