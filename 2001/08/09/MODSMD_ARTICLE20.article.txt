Ilies, sunshine and candy," she
writes in her liner notes.
Her lyrics are real — real,
ridiculous and insipid. In the
song "Prince Charming," she
sings: "I let ides a great white
horse / Not .1 ( .reybound bus."
She wonders how she'll meet
him: "Does be wear a

Ah.
The highlight ol the track is

when she gets edgy and raps:
"Prince William where you at,
where you at / Matt Damon

In the self-penned "Tired,"
