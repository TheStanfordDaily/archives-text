# Head over to Kimball's East for good jazz music and atmosphere

It can be hard to get a relaxing jazz
experience around here. Yoshi's is a
great place, but the chaos of navigating
the throngs in jack London Square and
the suffocating closeness of the tables in
the venue can leave you frazzled. And
Jazz at Pearl's in North Beach? You'll
pull out your hair just trying to park,
never mind the cold manner in which
the proprietor makes you guzzle four
drinks if you want to see a full show.
Luckily, there's an oasis where you
can have a truly mellow experience and
still listen to some real jazz. Kimball's
Last in Emeryville prides itself on a
solid, exciting lineup, and a concert a
couple of week's ago by renowned jazz
organist |immy Smith was no exception.
Smith is a consummate performer,
radiating a world-weariness and innate
knowledge of his instrument that no one
dare question. He rolled through a di
verse array of songs with no set list but
with the feel of the crowd telling him
what he should play. The walking bass
line created by bis organ held the rest of
his band together, and the melodies
seemed to weave seamlessly in and out
ofcenter stage, as though to defer to the
bandmates.

The show was heavy on improvisa
tion, and Smith had fun throwing in tid
bits such as the theme from Peter (iunn
and "I)o-Re-Mi" into the melody lines.
I be music was infused with everything
from Delta and Bayou sounds to New
Age jazz, soft rot k and big band sounds.
A fan called out "Mojo!" and Smith
graciously obliged with a rendition of
that song. "Stars" was another standout
performance by the whole group.
As he's not quite a young man any
more, Smith left the stage fora well-de
served break while his virtuoso guitarist
slowed things down to strum some in
trospective solos. But still apparent was
the technical proficiency that was so ap
parent in the faster ensemble pieces.
Not content with just playing the organ,
Smith delighted the crowd with bis own
brand of raspy scat singing during some
songs, lie interspersed the songs with
funnv tales of life on the road.
