# Not the Valdez, Built To Spill

### SARAH MEARON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Potatoes be damned. Mailing from
Boise, the three-piece band Built to Spill is
another one ol Idaho's exports that is just
as tasty and full of starch. Front man Doug
Martsch formed the band in the early ( .H)s
alter releasing three albums with Treep
eople. Built to Spill's latest offering, "An
cient Melodies of the Future," is placid,
melodious and marinated with full-bod
ied guitar incantations and wistful lyrics.
"Strange" kicks off the album and gen
tly caresses the sound waves with rousing
melodia and ponderous lyrics — ' That's
strange, but oh well." The lyrical tenden
cies are equally speculative on " The I lost"
as Martsch muses, "Don't you get tired of
everyone that you admire / They'll never
die, so why should I?/ Something is wrong
/ Something invisible is gone/They never
mind, so why should I?"
"Alarmed" is initially slow and labored,
but builds momentum, spilling over with
garbled keyboards and spirited guitars
three-quarters of the way into the song. 1 n
contrast, "Fly Around My Pretty Little
Miss" is a savory musical quickie that has a
brisk cadence and is thick with lyrics that
are spit out quickly, in rambling fashion:
"And when it's over / Set aside a moment
to forget / It's now or never / Now's the

chance to choose what you'll regret."
The lyrically modest "You Arc" fea
tures various permutations of the five
word idiom, "Everybody knows that you
are," and is built on a foundation of solid
guitar and percussion that twists and
turns through quixotic soundscapes.
"The Weather" furthers the wistfully ro
mantic undertone of the album, as
Martsch croons that "The stars gravitate
toward you ... the fog wraps itself around
you [and |. .. the clouds take their places
for you" amid lush, vigorous guitars and
keyboards.
A solid rock album distinguished by
subtle romantic nuances, Built to Spill's
"Ancient Melodies of the Future" is a spir
ited album replete with lyrical reflection
and extra-crispy instrumental prowess.
Martsch contemplates in the twangy
"Happiness" that "Happiness will only
happen when it can." For me, happiness is
listening to Built to Spill.
