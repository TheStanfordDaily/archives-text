Incredibly, mango skin can

Now much is that pit-stained

Megan, gave him a cjuic k sniff
and decided that the shirt didn't
smell too badlv, considering its
questionable origin.
Megan and Skylai were look
ing for remnants of the previous
owner s boch odor. Besides pooi
personal hvgieue, there are sev
cral causes of b.o. — the most
c onuiion of w hie h is the excretion
of smelly substances by bacteria
frolicking in dried sweat on the
skin's surface. Other causes can
include nutrient imbalances, en

zyme deficiencies and health
problems such as liver dysfunc
tion and diabetes.

Turn me over — I'm done
on this side
You'd think that somebody
like me — with niv blonde hair
and fair skin — would be ex
tremely careful about my expo
sure to the sun, and this is usual
ly the case. Unfortunately, I ne

piffled to slather myself with
sunscreen before we took our
Berkeley "three-hour tour" and,
as a result, my shoulders are now
red, toasty and rather lobster
like. Sometimes I just really need
my mother around to remind me
of things like this.
What actual!) happens when
you get a sunburn? Ultraviolet
rays from the sun inflict cellular
damage on the skin, prompting
increased blood flow to the capil
lary bed of the dermis (the lower
layer of the skin below the epi
dermis) as more cells arrive to re
pair the damage. 1 he redness of
a sunburn is caused by this extra
blood flow — and the pain is
caused by the activation of in
flammatory pathways because of
excessive UV radiation (ouch!).
Within a few days,
melanocytes — epidermal cells
that produce melanin, the pig
ment that protects skin from I Y
damage — increase in si/e and
number. A tan is eventually pro
duced as the melanin oxidizes.
I he number of melanocytes
helps dictate the skin type you
have — those with more are dark
and those with less are fair.
