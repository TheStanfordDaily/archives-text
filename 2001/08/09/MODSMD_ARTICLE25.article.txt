I lie largest earthquakes to
hit the Bay Area in the last cen

1989. Although the ItMMi earth
quake ys.is much stronger — at
an estimated magnitude of 7.9
the 1989 l.onia Prieta, after
80 years til urbanization,
caused tremendous damage —
estimated at 50-7 billion.
The source of the 1906
earthquake — the San Andreas
fault — ruptured from San
Juan Batista, hundreds of miles
north, to Cape Mendocino. In
contrast, Loina Prieta occurred

on ail oflshoot of the San An
dreas and only ruptured about
15 miles into the Santa (iru/
Mountains.
"We know that, since 19(H),
there have been relatively lew
earthquakes in the Bay Area,
and we think that [the 19(H)]
earthquake has inhibited earth
quake activity," Bero/.i said.
"We're in the midst of a eyele
where that activity will probablv
be increasing with time."
A project that Hero/a is cur
rently working on involves es
timating the intensity ol
ground motion during a vio
lent earthquake.
"Seismologists think that
they know fairlv well how slip
occurs during .in earthquake."
Bero/a said. "And we can use
that to predict — lor a given
distribution ol slip — just how
strong the shaking might be."
Because there is .1 dearth ol
information ol seismi( at ti\ it\
during large earthquakes,
Bero/a is — in a sense — simti

lating ilit' effects ol large
earthquakes. I his data will be
given lo Japanese and Ameri
can engineers, who will apply

the information to construct
retrofit buildings.
Predicting the exact timing
of earthquakes is still a distant
goal ol scientists. However,
Bero/a believes that scientists
will be able to predict earth
quakes on a decade-to-decade
time st ale.

"This long-term mode is
<|iiiU' useful because when we
construct buildings, we expect
them to last lor decades —or
longer — so knowing earth
quake probabilities during
those tittiescalcs is quite valu
able," Beroza said.
In 1999, the United States

that, by 2029, the Bay Area has
a 79 percent chance of experi

magnitude of at least (i.7.
Fortunately, we'll be relative

"The structural engineers on

"We know that, since 19(H),
