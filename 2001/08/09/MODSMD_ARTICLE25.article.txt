Lost in I lie blaze of a (lalifor
ni.i summer, we olten forget
anothci plietioinenoii associat
ed with the (loldeti State:
earl h<|uakes.
I nlike blizzards, we t amiot
tell in advance when earth
quakes will strike. I nlike hur
ricanes. the havoc an earth
quake w l eaks is su ill and
sound. Are ( alilornians. then,
helpless \ictitns against this
natural disaster?
Kntei (ueg Beroza, an associ
ate professor <>112 geophysics.
Beroza is a seismologist w hose re
sea rt li focuses on refining eartli
quake-measut ing techniques,
with the goal ol making predic
tions for large earthquakes.
I sing data gathered from
earthquake (enters throughout
the state. Beroza ( rune lies infor
mation with an arsenal ol < otn
putet programs and then inter
prets the findings.
"I never go out in the field."
Beroza said. "It's all computa

tional — thinking about how to
get bettei images ol the earth
quakes through studying earth
quake lot ations."

When there is too much
stress, the plates release the en

quakes. In California, earth
quakes result from northwest

Mm li ol Bero/a's work cen
ters tin studviug the effects of
smaller eat thquakes. the major
ity ol whit li are too weak to he
felt, \ltet a large earthquake—
in Morgan Hill in 1981 — seis
mologists noticed that a series
ol smaller earthquakes ot
curred in the same region of the
fault as the larger earthquake.
"We can use small earth

quakes to infer information
about larger ones," Beroza said.
Beroza s recent research in
dicates that large and small
earthquakes radiate the same
proportion of energy. I lie ap
plication ol information gath
ered from small earthquakes
vital because there is siu li scant
information from infrequent
laryei ones.

When .1 large earthquake
does num. its effects are hun
dreds ol times more powerful
than those ol smaller earth
quakes. Measured on the
Richtei scale, a magnitude six
earthquake is 32 limes more
powet till than a magnitude live

cart hquake.
I bus. a series of smaller
earthquakes cannot relieve as
much tension in the larth's
crust as can a l.irgei eat I hquake.
" I he number of cart hquakes
(let leases In a lactoi ol 10 lor
eat li unit ol magnitude in
crease, so while these bigger
earthquakes are ninth more
rare than smaller earthquakes,
tliev release a lot more energy,"
Beroza said. "So vou get most of
the strain released during the
milt h bigger earthquakes."
I lie largest earthquakes to
hit the Bay Area in the last cen
tury occurred in 190(1 and in
1989. Although the ItMMi earth
quake ys.is much stronger — at
an estimated magnitude of 7.9
the 1989 l.onia Prieta, after
80 years til urbanization,
caused tremendous damage —
estimated at 50-7 billion.
The source of the 1906
earthquake — the San Andreas
fault — ruptured from San
Juan Batista, hundreds of miles
north, to Cape Mendocino. In
contrast, Loina Prieta occurred

on ail oflshoot of the San An
dreas and only ruptured about
15 miles into the Santa (iru/
Mountains.
"We know that, since 19(H),
there have been relatively lew
earthquakes in the Bay Area,
and we think that [the 19(H)]
earthquake has inhibited earth
quake activity," Bero/.i said.
"We're in the midst of a eyele
where that activity will probablv
be increasing with time."
A project that Hero/a is cur
rently working on involves es
timating the intensity ol
ground motion during a vio
lent earthquake.
"Seismologists think that
they know fairlv well how slip
occurs during .in earthquake."
Bero/a said. "And we can use
that to predict — lor a given
distribution ol slip — just how
strong the shaking might be."
Because there is .1 dearth ol
information ol seismi( at ti\ it\
during large earthquakes,
Bero/a is — in a sense — simti
