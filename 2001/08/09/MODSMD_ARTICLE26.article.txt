high resolution, uh, movies on the Internet for the longest

why are streaming marines still so bad, and xrlien's it gaing

\. Kven though this is probabb the onl\ time

I'm going to pose
.is the Answer
Dude, I'm still
going to give you
the best answer I
(.111 think up. lit st
<>l all, what is

streaming media, really?
Vcording to I lie Institute lor 1 eleconimuni
cation Sciences, .1 division of the Department ol
( otnmerce, it is "transmitted video or audio data
that are viewed (or listened to) in real time, i.e., as
the information is received [on your computer).
Streaming media may be user-controlled (.is in
on-demand, pay-per-view movies) or server-con
trolled (as in Webcasting)."
Internet radio broadcasts are, lor the most
part, streaming, as are most video clips that you
(.111 duk and view quickly online. Currently,
three companies are lighting to get .1 share ol the
market for streaming media decoders.
One ol them, you guessed it. is Microsoft,
wlii(li makes the übiquitous Windows Media
Pla\er. appearing 011 even Windows desktop. A

competitor is longtime Microsoft rival Apple,
with its Quick lime player. Ihe final plaver in
tins field is the pioneer in this market. Real Ne
tworks, which makes Real Player.
As main Stanford students nu\ have noticed
while watching classes on Stanford Online,
streaming media is still not of the highest tpialit\.
()n the Stanford (inline Web site, one can click to
watch a nutnbei of Stanford courses using Win
dows Media I'lavei
I lowever. the \ iew s< reen is small, the (|iialii\
is poor when vou make the si reen bigger and the
iisfi has to wait lot buflering to occur. l he com
puter stores a part of the video on the computer
so that il connection speed slows down during
the video, the video won't have to stop immedi
atel\, but will instead use up the "buflered" por
tion of the video.
So whv isn't streaming media Ix'tter? 1 lie rea
sons are multi-faceted. First, there are three main
plavei sin the video decoder market, eat li with its
own proprietary video compression and decom
pression algorithms. I laving competitors in a mar
ket is good for innovation, but, oddl\. also slows it
down, because engineers need to build diflerent
s\ stems for diflerent compression standards.
Another problem is Internet congestion.
When there is high traffic over a network, band
width decreases. I his is why we have wait for
bnflering time before we c an watch ( NN on the
Web, so that when there is congestion, out com
puter screen won't be left hanging.
Congestion also degrades the qualitv of

streaming media. Information is
sent over the Internet m little data
packets that get split up before
being fused together again .it its
destination. Congestion causes
late ot losi packets, which results
in.in incomplete picture when the
user gets the media on the ret eiv
ing end.
Finally. Ilieie the "killei prob
lem modems and Digital
Subscriber Line (DSL) are fine
foi listening to Internet radio
broadcasts, but the network jusi
cannot handle something large,
like watt lung a movie over the
Internet. Lven if, as Stanford
students, we have a large band
width, not everyone tloes. I'll ink

ol ii like a pipe. II Blockbuster
wants to send you a movie to
watch on vour computer, the\
tan build a large pipe on theii
end, and we can build a large
pipe on our end. But what about

llie pipe be
tween us and
them? Who's
going to build a
<onne c 1 t) r
large enough
lo < on net I our
two ends?
I lie answer is
the government
or the private
sector. And the
government is
taking a wait
and see atti
tude i lulu now.

So lor now, it is up to the private

I'm going to pose
.is the Answer
Dude, I'm still
going to give you
the best answer I
(.111 think up. lit st
<>l all, what is

streaming media, really?
Vcording to I lie Institute lor 1 eleconimuni
cation Sciences, .1 division of the Department ol
( otnmerce, it is "transmitted video or audio data
that are viewed (or listened to) in real time, i.e., as
the information is received [on your computer).
Streaming media may be user-controlled (.is in
on-demand, pay-per-view movies) or server-con
trolled (as in Webcasting)."
Internet radio broadcasts are, lor the most
part, streaming, as are most video clips that you
(.111 duk and view quickly online. Currently,
three companies are lighting to get .1 share ol the
market for streaming media decoders.
One ol them, you guessed it. is Microsoft,
wlii(li makes the übiquitous Windows Media
Pla\er. appearing 011 even Windows desktop. A

competitor is longtime Microsoft rival Apple,
with its Quick lime player. Ihe final plaver in
tins field is the pioneer in this market. Real Ne
tworks, which makes Real Player.
As main Stanford students nu\ have noticed
while watching classes on Stanford Online,
streaming media is still not of the highest tpialit\.
()n the Stanford (inline Web site, one can click to
watch a nutnbei of Stanford courses using Win
dows Media I'lavei
I lowever. the \ iew s< reen is small, the (|iialii\
is poor when vou make the si reen bigger and the
iisfi has to wait lot buflering to occur. l he com
puter stores a part of the video on the computer
so that il connection speed slows down during
the video, the video won't have to stop immedi
atel\, but will instead use up the "buflered" por
tion of the video.
So whv isn't streaming media Ix'tter? 1 lie rea
sons are multi-faceted. First, there are three main
plavei sin the video decoder market, eat li with its
own proprietary video compression and decom
pression algorithms. I laving competitors in a mar
ket is good for innovation, but, oddl\. also slows it
down, because engineers need to build diflerent
s\ stems for diflerent compression standards.
Another problem is Internet congestion.
When there is high traffic over a network, band
width decreases. I his is why we have wait for
bnflering time before we c an watch ( NN on the
Web, so that when there is congestion, out com
puter screen won't be left hanging.
Congestion also degrades the qualitv of

streaming media. Information is
sent over the Internet m little data
packets that get split up before
being fused together again .it its
destination. Congestion causes
late ot losi packets, which results
in.in incomplete picture when the
user gets the media on the ret eiv
ing end.
Finally. Ilieie the "killei prob
lem modems and Digital
Subscriber Line (DSL) are fine
foi listening to Internet radio
broadcasts, but the network jusi
cannot handle something large,
like watt lung a movie over the
Internet. Lven if, as Stanford
students, we have a large band
width, not everyone tloes. I'll ink

ol ii like a pipe. II Blockbuster
wants to send you a movie to
watch on vour computer, the\
tan build a large pipe on theii
end, and we can build a large
pipe on our end. But what about

llie pipe be
tween us and
them? Who's
going to build a
<onne c 1 t) r
large enough
lo < on net I our
two ends?
I lie answer is
the government
or the private
sector. And the
government is
taking a wait
and see atti
tude i lulu now.

tions into (lie home. I lie demand

lions will only grow, and the mar
