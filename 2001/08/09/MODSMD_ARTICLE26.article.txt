(I Yo, Answer I huh', fieople keef) telling me "stream
ing media" is going to get better. /'; <e been /lining to witch
high resolution, uh, movies on the Internet for the longest
time so I dm't have to go to, uh. lilocklnister anymore. Ihti
why are streaming marines still so bad, and xrlien's it gaing
to gel belter?

Dude, I'm still
going to give you
the best answer I
(.111 think up. lit st
<>l all, what is

streaming media, really?
Vcording to I lie Institute lor 1 eleconimuni
cation Sciences, .1 division of the Department ol
( otnmerce, it is "transmitted video or audio data
that are viewed (or listened to) in real time, i.e., as
the information is received [on your computer).
Streaming media may be user-controlled (.is in
on-demand, pay-per-view movies) or server-con
trolled (as in Webcasting)."
Internet radio broadcasts are, lor the most
part, streaming, as are most video clips that you
(.111 duk and view quickly online. Currently,
three companies are lighting to get .1 share ol the
market for streaming media decoders.
One ol them, you guessed it. is Microsoft,
wlii(li makes the Ã¼biquitous Windows Media
Pla\er. appearing 011 even Windows desktop. A

competitor is longtime Microsoft rival Apple,
with its Quick lime player. Ihe final plaver in
tins field is the pioneer in this market. Real Ne

As main Stanford students nu\ have noticed
while watching classes on Stanford Online,
streaming media is still not of the highest tpialit\.

puter stores a part of the video on the computer
so that il connection speed slows down during

So whv isn't streaming media Ix'tter? 1 lie rea
sons are multi-faceted. First, there are three main
plavei sin the video decoder market, eat li with its
own proprietary video compression and decom
pression algorithms. I laving competitors in a mar
ket is good for innovation, but, oddl\. also slows it
down, because engineers need to build diflerent
s\ stems for diflerent compression standards.
Another problem is Internet congestion.
When there is high traffic over a network, band
width decreases. I his is why we have wait for
bnflering time before we c an watch ( NN on the
Web, so that when there is congestion, out com
