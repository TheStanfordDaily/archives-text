The Nanedi Vallis, Mars vallsy is several hundreds of kilometers long and has
only a few tributaries along its course. It is believed that its water supply came
from the drainage of groundwater. On the other hand, the valley is deep,
large and meandering — proof that the valley was active fora long time.
Whether or not it was formed in one long flow episode or several spaced in
time — possibly ten to thousands of years apart — is still to be determined. The
valley is about 2 km across. In the top portion of the image, a channel can be
seen at the bottom of the valley that reflects the width of the flow and the real
dimension of the water conduit.
