Grad student questions new housing plan

commenting on the inherent inequit) and
slu-.ii idiot \ ol the housing stipend program
as currentb administered. But this new
wrinkle in the progi am is too much of an in
sult to reason to gag oil quietly. Where is the
central intelligence and/oi nioralit\ at work
here? I low < mild six li a dei ision have been
made loengineet a pol.u i/ed societ\ of grad
uate student "haves" and "have nots" using a
random nuniher genetatoi — with the have
not.s outnumbering the haves In sonie'Jto 1
margin, no less!?
What aftei all is wrong with Stanford? Be
tween this sad lottery episode and the recent
"I ,et them go on Welfare" fiasco, it seems the
administi .ition must he struggling with some
kind ol hvbridi/ed Marie \ntoinette 1- \a
IVton < oinplex. I am appalled, embarrassed
and extrenieh disappointed.
()l < ourse, l>\ the same token, I have no
( hoicebut to grovel loi the nione\ likeevei y

crously expensive plat e to li\e. I low perfect
l\ degrading and unnecessary it all is I re
sent it. Clearly this I Ith-houi amendment
demonstrates a dawning, il belated .it know I
edgement on the part ol the atlministration
that the program is fundamentally Hawed.
Nonetheless, the reined \ as proposed is 11 is
tasteful and regressive. I hose who realK
need the mone\ most will be fort«.•< 1 to take
the $100, leaving I bet bant e at $250 to those
loi whom it represents more ola lianth
windfall.
And speaking ol distasteful, how is it that
the e-mail announiing this new stipend op
tion tame out on a l*'rida\ afternoon with a
I uesday noon deadline to respond? Main
grad students might miss out simph bet ausc
they're awa\ lor a few days. possibb even, oh

From the very start this stipend progi am lias
been fraught w nli these gratuitous "respond
before midnight tonight" style stumbling

blocks Why, it not smipl\ to trip otherwise
eligible people up .iihl out ol tlit* running on
let litiic «ilii ii*s?
I suggest ill.n the Stanford administration
show sonic leadeiship hai kbone and honest
equanimity ol purpose l>\ owning tip to a
Hawed program and redoing the whole
thing. I his would not he nearh so utilaii to
the IbS who alread\ "liil n big" as it would he

everyone. II a lotter\ is indeed what the

been the first 111111', I'm sure.
I lie intelligent and equitable approat h is
