Peter Yitousek. the ('.lillorel (i. Moi t ison Prof. in

Yitousek's research foc uses on "the earth's me

search in Ins native Hawaii, which he described as
"ground /eto" in the study of "biological invasions

The ecologist is currently studving the eflect of
nitrogen on Karth's biological balance. Yitousek
said that an overabundance ol nitrogen in the at
mosphere can n iggei "explosive growth" in a vai i
ety ol spec ies, while sufloc aliiig others.
"That's a huge alteration in how the world
works," \ itousek told lime. "Oui capacity to
change the cat th means we must manage this."
Brown is the inventoi ol the "DNA Microar

Brown said. " flic success of that work, which re

lie showed that when high closes of the drug are
administered within eight hours ola spinal injury,
the victim can recover up to 20 percent of central
nervous function.
