What I saw, though—once I
started looking—l found pro
foundly disturbing.
Of course, the hundreds of
people in attendance were there
for the community, and that
made sense. Fhev should want to
be together on the anniversan of

their simultaneous emancipation
and unification.
But the eflbrts to foster com
munity — and, in so doing, create
one positive image of Indians in
the Bay Area — could not mask
the reality of seemingly irreconcil
able differences and a refusal to
acknowledge the presence of con
flict and stratification. In short, In
dians gathered in Santa ('.lata and
Fremont to celebrate how far
they've come and to take pride in
the place they've created for
themselves here. Hut the pre<x( u
patiou with projecting the perlect
picture left them taking far too
great pains to deny the problems
and struggles — the fears — that
also face their community, as they
would face an\ immigrant group.
I his was most apparent in
Fremont, where some 10(1 pro
testers turned out to denounce
what thev saw .is the ill-treatment
of Sikhs, a religious group, in
India and to advocate the cre
ation of an independent Sikh na
tion. khalistan. Relegated to a
small side street and surrounded
by unabashed revelry, these
men, women and children to
gether seemed to me the most
telling representation of this
day's ugly underbelly.
While I don't pretend to un
derstand the depth or breadth of
their cause and am in no position
to make any judgments on it, I felt
for the protesters because they
were the day's embarrassment,
and the vast majority of the peo
ple they wanted to reach blatantb
ignored them, much the same
way those people choose to turn a
blind eye to poverty, over'popula
tion, conflict and so many other
inescapable, if seemingly distant,
national ills.
And, yet, despite this, I loved
being there. I loved the bustle, the
smells, the sounds, the life. 1 loved
the way the causes resonated with
me. I loved the familiarity, and I
loved the acceptance.
But why? Because it all put me
in touch with the neglected but
ever-present Indian inside me?
()r because I miss New York, and
this reminded me of the city? Be
cause I find suffering romantic
and want to repent for drifting
away from public service in my
time .it this fine institution? Be
cause. as much as I hate to admit

it, I buy into the hype as much as
the next person?
Let's be honest: Indian is in.
\ v ('..it with (.wen Stefani's bindis
and Madonna's voga, Indian
women's corner on the Miss
World and Miss I 'diverse
pageants and the profusion of
even thing from Indian-inspired
music to furniture, there's no es
caping the sin( esslul lakeovei In
all things Indian of the rest ol the
unsuspe< ting world.
So the cyni( al part of me is in
dined to believe that my own un
expected emotional connection to
the events of recent weeks is
merely a result of the commercial
ization of Indian culture. Never
mind all this talk of ancestral
lands and inherent brown-ness.
Fxcept that the familiarity and
acceptance I mentioned not long
ago did not come out of trends
and <onsumeristn, though that is
not to say that it came out of some
thing more profound either. I felt
what I did and was received the
wav I was because I look Indian.
Had I been any other ethnicity,
the experience would have been

fiir different, regardless of m\ ( ul
tural context. In any other color,
even if I knew all the songs, spoke
a language or two and was inar
i led to an Indian man. I would be
( lite and obsessed, but I would
not be Indian.
And therein lies the rub. I
suppose. I am the B.ih.imi.in
born daughter of (itivanese par
ents who moved to the would-be
New Yoi k section ol (lonnectii ut
and raised their four children in
an ultra-liberal home sin round
ed by everyone but Indians. But
I'm ethnically Indian, and that
means that, no matter how
fraudulent 1 deem my own Indi
an-ncss to be, my face gives me
(laim and access to a culture that
always played second liddle to
Americana in my house.
How strange. How odd that
one can seem to identify so deeply
with a community at a time as
happy as this, but not know
whether that relationship is based
in culture or commerce. I low ab
solutely bizarre that, even as I
struggle to decide what shade of
"Other" I want to be, there is a

w holt* group ol people who don't
need my input ot permission to
( heck the box they've already re
solved to put me in.
I think I celebrated m\ first In
dian Independence Day yester
day. It seems one wouldn't think
so In looking at me, but perhaps
I've delayed because I didn't have
independence to celebrate. And
maybe I still don't. I am not inde
pendent from the cultural conno
tations of ni) long black hair and
nose ring, and Indians, as a com
munity, are not independent
from the struggles that still face
them — that face us — in India
and abroad.
It's easy to hate the British Em
pire for robbing us of our identity,
both national and individual, and
attempting to quash our will to
deny and light injustice, but what
do we do when the obstacles are
each other and ourselves? I'm not
entirely sure I should celebrate
again next year.

Bay Area Sikhs turned out to protest at this weekend's "Festival of India" in Fremont.

"Oh. here we go," any semi

punch line: "And then I realized
how important this indepen

Not so much.

and expecting to be out of place
and eventually found out for the
fraudulent Indian that I am.
(More on m\ fraudulent e later.)
Instead, I came upon fairs full
of people, parades showcasing
the many faces of bay Area Indi
ans, teenagers cruising and fami
lies — traditional and non — en
joying themselves. And 1 til in

over in\ shoulder and reporter's
notebook in hand, I became to the
people around me the young fe
male Indian writer / photograph
er / journalist, an obvious pillar of
the conununitN and potential role
model for six-year-old brown
girls every where.
Again, not so much. Hut, while
I will continue to struggle against
those labels as long as they feel as
pretentious to me as they do now,
they immediately afforded me the
freedom, confidence and author
ity to observe and interpret my
surroundings in ways I never had
the opportunity to before.
What I saw, though—once I
started looking—l found pro
foundly disturbing.
Of course, the hundreds of
people in attendance were there
for the community, and that
made sense. Fhev should want to
be together on the anniversan of

their simultaneous emancipation
and unification.
But the eflbrts to foster com
munity — and, in so doing, create
one positive image of Indians in
the Bay Area — could not mask
the reality of seemingly irreconcil
able differences and a refusal to
acknowledge the presence of con
flict and stratification. In short, In
dians gathered in Santa ('.lata and
Fremont to celebrate how far
they've come and to take pride in
the place they've created for
themselves here. Hut the pre<x( u
patiou with projecting the perlect
picture left them taking far too
great pains to deny the problems
and struggles — the fears — that
also face their community, as they
would face an\ immigrant group.
I his was most apparent in
Fremont, where some 10(1 pro
testers turned out to denounce
what thev saw .is the ill-treatment
of Sikhs, a religious group, in
India and to advocate the cre
ation of an independent Sikh na
tion. khalistan. Relegated to a
small side street and surrounded
by unabashed revelry, these
men, women and children to
gether seemed to me the most
telling representation of this
day's ugly underbelly.
While I don't pretend to un
derstand the depth or breadth of
their cause and am in no position
to make any judgments on it, I felt
for the protesters because they
were the day's embarrassment,
and the vast majority of the peo
ple they wanted to reach blatantb
ignored them, much the same
way those people choose to turn a
blind eye to poverty, over'popula
tion, conflict and so many other
inescapable, if seemingly distant,
national ills.
And, yet, despite this, I loved
being there. I loved the bustle, the
smells, the sounds, the life. 1 loved
the way the causes resonated with
me. I loved the familiarity, and I
loved the acceptance.
But why? Because it all put me
in touch with the neglected but
ever-present Indian inside me?
()r because I miss New York, and
this reminded me of the city? Be
cause I find suffering romantic
and want to repent for drifting
away from public service in my
time .it this fine institution? Be
cause. as much as I hate to admit

it, I buy into the hype as much as
the next person?
Let's be honest: Indian is in.
\ v ('..it with (.wen Stefani's bindis
and Madonna's voga, Indian
women's corner on the Miss
World and Miss I 'diverse
pageants and the profusion of
even thing from Indian-inspired
music to furniture, there's no es
caping the sin( esslul lakeovei In
all things Indian of the rest ol the
unsuspe< ting world.
So the cyni( al part of me is in
dined to believe that my own un
expected emotional connection to
the events of recent weeks is
merely a result of the commercial
ization of Indian culture. Never
mind all this talk of ancestral
lands and inherent brown-ness.
Fxcept that the familiarity and
acceptance I mentioned not long
ago did not come out of trends
and <onsumeristn, though that is
not to say that it came out of some
thing more profound either. I felt
what I did and was received the
wav I was because I look Indian.
Had I been any other ethnicity,
the experience would have been

fiir different, regardless of m\ ( ul
tural context. In any other color,
even if I knew all the songs, spoke
a language or two and was inar
i led to an Indian man. I would be
( lite and obsessed, but I would
not be Indian.
And therein lies the rub. I
suppose. I am the B.ih.imi.in
born daughter of (itivanese par
ents who moved to the would-be
New Yoi k section ol (lonnectii ut
and raised their four children in
an ultra-liberal home sin round
ed by everyone but Indians. But
I'm ethnically Indian, and that
means that, no matter how
fraudulent 1 deem my own Indi
an-ncss to be, my face gives me
(laim and access to a culture that
always played second liddle to
Americana in my house.
How strange. How odd that
one can seem to identify so deeply
with a community at a time as
happy as this, but not know
whether that relationship is based
in culture or commerce. I low ab
solutely bizarre that, even as I
struggle to decide what shade of
"Other" I want to be, there is a

w holt* group ol people who don't
need my input ot permission to
( heck the box they've already re
solved to put me in.
I think I celebrated m\ first In
dian Independence Day yester
day. It seems one wouldn't think
so In looking at me, but perhaps
I've delayed because I didn't have
independence to celebrate. And
maybe I still don't. I am not inde
pendent from the cultural conno
tations of ni) long black hair and
nose ring, and Indians, as a com
munity, are not independent
from the struggles that still face
them — that face us — in India
and abroad.
It's easy to hate the British Em
pire for robbing us of our identity,
both national and individual, and
attempting to quash our will to
deny and light injustice, but what
do we do when the obstacles are
each other and ourselves? I'm not
entirely sure I should celebrate
again next year.
