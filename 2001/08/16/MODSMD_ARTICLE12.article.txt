Square movie theatei showed Us
liu.il lilins before (losing its doors
forever.
I he theater, whit h ran pri
marily independent, foreign
and limited distribution lilms,
was one of the top five perform
ers of Landmark's T>l theaters
nationwide.
I he theater's closure ended
months of speculation about its
uncertain future following the
surprise 90-da\ eviction notice it
received in April from its land
lord, I'alo \lto Square ownei Lq
uitv (>llice Properties.
Trior to the eviction notifica
tion, the theater had been operat
ing on a mouth-to-inonth lease
for the past two years, evei since
acquiring the complex in Sep
tember of 1999.
1 lie eviction deadline was ex
tended by b() days in late May,
when 1 .andniark was sold to ()ak
tree (Capital of I .os Angeles follow
ing the bankrupts of its parent
company. Silver Cinemas. 1 he
extension ran out last week and
the theater was forced to ( lose.
Palo Alto Mayor Sandy 112 akins,
Councilman Carv Fa/zino and

other t it\ officials look p,irt in the
negotiations with Lquit\ and en
couraged them to extend Land
mark's lease.
"1 he (it\ had been involved
with Landmark I heaters in
terms of assisting tlicit eflorts
with rem.lining at the square,"
Siis.in Arpan, I'alo Alto's eco
noniit resourtc manager, said.
\dditionalb, many I'alo Alto
residents showed theii support
foi the iheatei b\ sending letters
and e-mails to Fquitv's ollit e ask
ing I hem not to evit I Landmark.
Many Stanford students who
frequented the theatei were
disappointed over the news of
its ( losing.
"I'm sorry that it is closing,"
sophomore Lauren Wechsler
said. "Ii is nice to have a theater
that plavs movies other than I he
big blo( kbusters. I like wait liing
foreign films and the smallet in
depentlent films thai aren't |in|
mass disi i ibution."
"I think it's terrible that it
closed," sophomore Liz/v Raflin
said, "li s not a big chain movie
theater—it shows all of the
unique films that don't end up in
(Century theaters."
Palo Alto Square served a seg
ment ol the community that pre
ferred Landmark's intimate
venues to the large blockbuster
theaters, according to Rassin.
I nder Palo Alto zoning regu
lations that date bat k to w hen the
complex was built, the Palo Alto
Square site must house a movie
theater, Arpan said.
"We've been in contact with

the landlord and let them know
there must be a theater in tli.it
space because it is a planned com
munity /one," she said. "We've
also heard through the grapevine
that [the new tenant| will be (.en
tury Cheaters, although th.»t
hasn't been confirmed."
Century Cheaters is a pri
vately owned chain of multi
plexes with 700 screens in

eleven states, including theaters
in San |ose, Redwood City and
Mountain View. Representa
tives from (Century Cheaters de
dined to comment on the ru
mors about the Palo Alto Square
site. Kquity declined to com
ment as well, saving only that it
is already in negotiations with a
new tenant.
l he last films shown .it Palo

Alto Square were John Mitc hell's
"Uedwig and the Angry Inch
and Christopher Nolan's "Me
mento."
Ik-cause of the theater's clo
sure, the films are scheduled to
move to other Landmark loca
tions in the area, which include
tlie Park and Guild theaters in
Menlo Park, and the Aquarius
Cheater in downtown Palo Alto.
