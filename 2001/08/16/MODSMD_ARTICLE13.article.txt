### SANDRA UPSON EDITORIAL STAFF 
As .1 result of growing concei 11s about meningitis
scares ac rosscollege campuses, espet iall\ in the bay
Area, the Cowell Student Health Service will hold a
campus vaccination lair in the autumn specifically
for flu and meningitis vaccinations.
Though Cowell has offered meningitis vaccina
tions iu the past, this initiative is intended tostep up
the preventive effort against meningitis among
Stanford students.
Students are frequently thought of as a par
ticularly high-risk group for the spread ol
meningitis. According to the journal of the
American Medical Association, dormitory life
puts students at increased risk lor contracting
the disease.
Meningitis, which is spread through the transfer
of saliva, can be deadly and kill within hours. Ac
cording to the Meningitis Research Foundation
Web site, the bacteria that causes meningitis is car
ried by one in ten people and can be carried by the
majority of the population without people suc
cumbing to the disease.
In a small percentage of the population, howev
er, the bacteria can get into the blood stream and
cause meningitis. Symptoms lor meningitis are sim
ilar to llu symptoms and are often mistaken for
other common illnesses.

I lie bat teria, however, are very weak and can
onl\ survive fora very short period of time out
side of the bodv, whit his why it is not carried on
household objects and can only be passed be
tween people in dose contact. Most of the popu
lation ends up carrying the bacteria at some point
in their lives without contracting the disease.
Though it is rare, meningitis can develop very
rapidly and is deadly.
As of yet, there is no vaccine that protects
against all strains of meningitis and offers com
plete coverage.
The bay Area in particular has become more lo
nised on preventing meningitis after a series of
deaths from the illness earlier in the year.
"\V'e are just getting more and more interest and
attention tailed to this, and .is it starts to look like
there is a high-risk group, we are amping up our at
tention." said Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Cowell,
in the San Francisco Chronicle.
Though Stanford has been offering information
about the risks ol meningitis to both students and
parents for several years, this is the first year that
Cowell will be putting on a vaccination fair involv
ing meningitis vaccinations.
Other Bay Area universities, including as San
Francisco State I niversity and I C-berkeley. are
â€¢i Iso stepping up their elforts against meningitis,
by also offering vaccination days and informative
literature.
