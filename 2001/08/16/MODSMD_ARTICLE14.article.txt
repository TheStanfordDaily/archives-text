Senior fullback Casey Moore scored the biggest touchdown of last year's 5-6 season with
this overtime game-winner against Cal; Stanford hopes the return of Moore and the rest
of the backfield will spark a rejuvenated running game in 2001.

Special Teams
Punting w ill be a (rut ial issue for
the Cardinal to address; the team
finished ninth in theconferent e last

war, averaging a woef ul 32.0 v;ircU
per punt. Junior Frit Johnson
takes over those duties from lilili
vearsenior Mike Biselli, who'll sink
to placekicking this season.
On the return side, Wells lias
established himself as a pivnuei
kickofi return specialist aliet aver
aging 22.5 yards per return last
year. Powell will likelv handle the
hulk of the punt return duties
Overall Projection
l he more things change, the
more they stay the same. I .egitiiuate
rushing threats and Fasani's versa
tility might return the oilcnse to
1999 heights, but question marks
about the defense still abound, \ltei
averaging 31:27 minutes per g.uue
<>1 possession last year, the (Cardi
nal's best defense tnav be to pound
tin- run and hold onto the ball.
A lot will depend on whethci
mid-range conference teams like
I CL\ and USC pan out, but keep
in mind that one more win loi
Stanford last year would have put
the fourth-plate team into the
postseason, l he Cardinal won't
bring home a title, but 7-1 with a
('.hristmas bowl game is reai liable
