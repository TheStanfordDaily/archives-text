Hit- Stanford women's volley
ball program can remember a
lime when H would be shocked io
be ranked .is low .is 1 Oili in a pre
season poll.
And the Cardinal can certain
ly remember back to when it
would be confounded to lind
three Pacific 10 Conference
teams ranked ahead of it to start
a season, as is the case this year
with Stanford looking up to No.
2 Southern (California, No. (i Ari
zona and No. 7 l'( I.A.
I'he team remembers those
times particularly well because
they were only a year ago. After
all, Stanford was the school that

made six filial four appearances
in the '.His, c laiming .in NCAA
record lour national titles along
the way.
I\ut alter the 2000 season
which saw the I'rojans and the
Wildcats ascend to the l'ac-10
throne lor the first time and
Stanford finish at record lows ol
19th in the nation and fourth in
the conference — the Cardinal,
which started practice Monday,
knows those times are long gone.
Fortunately, Stanford, led In
Ail-American juniot 1 ogan loin,
has a 2001 talent pool deep
enough to give the Cardinal a
pretty good shot .it reclaiming its
glory days on the court.
" flie l\u -10 is going to have.«
good \eai this year, and iliere are
20 oi 25 very good learns around
die country this year," said new
head eoac h |ohn Dunning.
"A lot of years, Stanford has
been ranked higher than 10th,
but alter coining off an 18-12
veai and finishing Iburth in the
1 'at 10, people tend to look at
those things in the polls," Dun
ning said.
I here are a lot of new fat es on
the court in Maples Pavilion this

Ireshmen making their debut at
the I arm. I he (i-loot-l outside
hitiei conies to Stanford widely
touted as the top recruit in the na
tion. As preseason practices
begin, Nnamani is too eager to
pla\ lo be bothered by the expec
tations thai precede her.
"It's so much fun right now, I
don't feel the pressure," Nna
mani said. "It's a dream come
true to be here and work with
these great coaches and players.
"I can't wait till Logan gets

here. I'm going to run up and give
her a big bug. It'll be amazing to
play with her and learn from her
bet 'a use she's world-class."
Nnamani gives Stanford
ama/.ing depth at outside hitter
ibis season, as the Cardinal fea
tures six players capable ol stal l
ing at the three outside hitter po
sitions. Which three will actually
start lor the Cardinal will be de
termined in the next two weeks
ol practice.
With plavers switching posi
tions in niidseason and nun ing in
and out of starting roles, the Car
dinal struggled lo build chem
istry on the court in 2000, so
Dunning is determined to set a
consistent lineup ibis season.
" I here's a lot of competition
for all the spots." Dunning said.
"I don't think anvone is too con
fident about having sealed a spot
at this point."

Junior Ashley Ivv, third in kills
and second in digs on the team

for the outside billet spot on the
