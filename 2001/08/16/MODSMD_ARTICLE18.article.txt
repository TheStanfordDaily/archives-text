I lere's a look .it the teams Stan
ford must heat to go to Pasadena:
Boston College
The Cardinal opens its 2001
campaign by welcoming Boston

Brian St. Pierre at QB. I'lie inexpe
rienced signals alter and offensive
line mav limit the cxplosivcness of
RB William (ireen and WRs |amal
Burke and Dedrick Dewalt. (ireen,
who rushed lor 1,1 (Vf yards splitting
time in the backlield last season,
may have a breakout year as the fea
tured running back.
Key matchup: Stanford receivers
vs. Kagles secondary. As the receiv
ing corps takes its first step in filling
the void left by Deßonnie Pitts, they
will Ik- tested by defensive backs
Lenny Walls and Trevor White.
San Jose State
(iiven its history , this Silicon Val
ley test at San Jose Suite Sep. 15 may
Ix- as important as any game on
Stanford's schedule. After three
straight upset losses, a victory
against the Spartans would do won
ders lor the Cardinal's psyche. But
tbe Spartans will Ik- a formidable

opponent; led by RB Deonce
Whitaker and QB Marcus Arroyo,
the Spartans have a high-cx tane of
fense that will put points on the
lx>ai (l. I he (lardinal should Ix' able
to score plenty of points against the
porous Spartan defense.
key matc hup: Stanford defense
vs. Whitaker. For Stanford to win,
the defense must prevent Whitaker
from running wild.
Arizona State
Stanford opens Pac -10 plav at
home against Ari/ona State Sep. 22.
I'nder new head coach Dirk koct
ter, the Sun Devils will try to c limb
back to the upper ec helon of the
Pac-10. Though Ari/ona Slate has
great individual talents like 1)1- I er
red Suggs and O'l l.e\i Jones, the\
do not have a solid unit on ollense
oi defense. Stanford ma\ beluck\ to
draw the Sun Devils in (he early sea
son; they could be a dangerous
leant late il they gel under koetter.
key matchup: DKs Marcus
1 l(x>ver and Austin l.ee vs. Ari/ona
State line. 1 he Sun 1 )e\ ils have a big
cjuestion mark at QB as potential
starters Jeff krohn and Andrew
Walter are very shaky; the re
vamped Cardinal defensive line
must pressure whoever gets I he ball.
Southern California
The Cardinal travels to USC
Sep. 29 for its first Pac-10 road
game. Former New Fngland Patri
ots coach IVteCarroll takes over the
beleaguered Trojan football pro
gram. Stanford's receivers will Ix'
challenged by the aggressive Tro
jan secondary, led by Darrell
Ridcaux. The Cardinal will also
have to protect QB Randy Fasani
against DF. Lonnie Ford and bud
ding star D l Bernard Riley. On of

fense for the I'rojans, enigmatic QB
( .arson Palmer will finally have to
live up to his potential if'USC is to
succeed this season.
Key matt hup: C.b Ruben (larter
vs. WR Kareem Kelly. II former
bYI passing guru Norm (lliow can
unlock Palmer's potential, star wide
receiver Kareem Kelly mav Ik- the
happiest man in I'rojanville. Often
frustrated by Palmer's inability to
get him the ball, Kelly will stretch
Stanford's secondary il Palmer de

men must outplay Washington
Stale's poteutialK dominant ollen
sive line to contain (lesser and Rb
Dave Minnich. If they do. thev can
exploit the Cougars' Achilles heel:
their weak passing game.
Key matchup: Stanford Rbs vs.
Washington State front seven. It's
imperative that Stanford establish
its running game against a (lougar
defense th.it allowed 174.3 rushing
yards per game last year.
Oregon
Stanford will play the Ducks for
the first time in two seasons when
they travel to hostile Autzen Stadi
um Oct. 20. Heisman l rophy can
didate Joey I lan ington will lead
the Ducks in passing and billboard
yards. Rb Maurice Morris,a receiv
ing threat out of the hack field, pre
sents all sorts of problems for de
fenses, while star CB Rashad Bau
man gives quarterbacks headaches.
Key matchup: I'K Mike Biselli
and P KricJohnson vs. ()regon fans.

In a stadium where spectators
crowd the field, Stanford will lx
hacked up deep at some | h»iiit.
Johnson must avoid shanks, while
Biselli has to convert field goal
chances. Points will Ik- at a premi
um; the Ducks have not lost at
Autzen since 1997.
UCLA
Stanford will host perhaps die Pac
10's most dangerous and talented
team Oct. 27. New defensive coor
dinator Phil Snow has die unenvi
able task of keeping players like DK
Kenyoti Coleman, LB Ryan Nece
and LB Ricky Manning, |r. from

underachieving. If the Bruins'de
fense is half as good as their offense
— led by RB DeShaun Foster — the
Bruins may playing at home for the
national title |an 3.
Key matchup: Stanford sec
ondary vs. YVR Brian Foli-Dixon.
Hie Bruins always seem to have
big-play receivers who drive stakes
through their opponents' hearts in
the fourth quarter. The Cardinal
secondary cannot allow Dixon to
help the Bruins convert on third
and long late in the game.

unlock Palmer's potential, star wide
receiver Kareem Kelly mav Ik- the
happiest man in I'rojanville. Often

Dave Minnich. If they do. thev can
exploit the Cougars' Achilles heel:
their weak passing game.
Key matchup: Stanford Rbs vs.
Washington State front seven. It's

defense th.it allowed 174.3 rushing
yards per game last year.
Oregon
Stanford will play the Ducks for
the first time in two seasons when
they travel to hostile Autzen Stadi
um Oct. 20. Heisman l rophy can

the Ducks in passing and billboard
yards. Rb Maurice Morris,a receiv

sents all sorts of problems for de
fenses, while star CB Rashad Bau

Autzen since 1997.
UCLA
Stanford will host perhaps die Pac
10's most dangerous and talented
team Oct. 27. New defensive coor
dinator Phil Snow has die unenvi
able task of keeping players like DK
Kenyoti Coleman, LB Ryan Nece
and LB Ricky Manning, |r. from

underachieving. If the Bruins'de
fense is half as good as their offense
— led by RB DeShaun Foster — the
Bruins may playing at home for the
national title |an 3.
Key matchup: Stanford sec
ondary vs. YVR Brian Foli-Dixon.
Hie Bruins always seem to have
big-play receivers who drive stakes
through their opponents' hearts in
the fourth quarter. The Cardinal
secondary cannot allow Dixon to
help the Bruins convert on third
and long late in the game.
