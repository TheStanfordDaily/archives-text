## Watch out for computer viruses

minders, it sometimes feels like
the world is being taken over by
computer viruses.
While consumers distribute
their credit card information to
buy DVDs on-line, and users
download hundreds of photos,
software and games each day, the
Internet seems to be the perfect
breeding ground for viruses. Has
the growth of the Internet been
accompanied by a massive infesta
tion of computer viruses? And
what does the presence of viruses
mean for the security of comput
er systems?
(Computer security experts find
n difficult to make definitive con
clusions relating the growth of the
Internet to the frequency of com
puter viruses.
Some analysts believe that the
Internet fueled the propagation
of viruses, especially during the
golden age of the "new economy,"
as personal information raced
across the information highway
and computer networks expand
ed to include millions of users.
Others, such as Dr. Fred
Cohen, who coined the term

"computer virus" and is the inven
tor of computer viruses and virus
defense techniques, do not believe
there have been any major
changes in the field since the
1980s. Cohen explains today's
prevalence of viruses by saying
that "viruses spread more where
there is a greater population of
susceptible individuals and vet
tors for infection."
Meanwhile, governments and
law enforcement officials believe
that global Internet-related
crimes are rapidly rising. As a re
sult of the extensive destruction
caused by the "Love Bug" virus
last year, governments and or
ganizations around the world
have gathered to organize com
mittees to address Internet-re
lated crime.
file difficulty of computer se
curity in the information age lies
in the dynamic nature of comput
er viruses. Computer security ex
perts have trouble agreeing on
one definition for "computer
virus." It is generally considered a
program that can infect other pro
grams in an eflort to reproduce it
self. Since every program that be
comes infected can also act as a
virus, the infection grows to the
point that the virus may even
erase files or lock up systems.
Cohen makes the analogy to .1
biological virus.
" | ust as bi< >logical diseases must

be able to survive in the environ
ment outside the host for long
enough to get from host to host, so
do computer viruses have to re
in. lin stable in the environment so
they can survive the trip from host
to host," (Cohen said.
And just as the bod) uses the
immune system as its first line of
defense, a computer requires a
preventive measure against an at
tacking computer virus. (Comput
er security stall recommend that
every user install anti-virus soft
ware so that the first defense starts
at the individual user level. Anti
virus software such as Symantec's
Norton Antivirus or McAfee's
Vii usScan should be regularK up
dated to be ellective against new
viruses. Stanford provides the lat
est version of Norton as a down
load for all of its network users.
Put simply, anti-virus software
works by recognizing unique
patterns of ac tivity in a virus. It
then quarantines the virus so it
will be unable to infect am more
of the computer system. New
viruses are constantly added to
the virus definition files main
tained by the maker of the anti
virus software.
Most viruses can be controlled
in this fashion. However, ex
tremely destructive viruses such as
the Love Bug virus and the more
recent Code Red virus demand
the attention of a computer net

work's set urity team.
" The only time lliat we get in
volved is when a problem has in
some wax aliened the network on
the whole ... It is our job to get an
advisorx out to the community,"
s.iul Stephen Hansen, Stanford's
computer security officer.
Hansen's team has been filter
ing the computer system for the
('.ode Red II worm for the past
week. At its peak two weeks ago,
the (.ode Red worm infected
about 250,000 computers and w as
followed bx its inoi e malicious rel
ative, (lode Red 11. which caused
several outages across the nation,
including the disruption of some
Associated Press services and the
infection of software at Microsoft.
Though computer viruses
dominate newspaper headlines,
traditional law-breaking cases on
the Internet still make up the ma
jority of cyber crimes, according
to Internet Alliance, an industry
analyst group. I hc group pre
dicts that greater worldwide ac
cess to the Internet will continue
to lead to many more cases of
fraud, identity theft, pornogra
phy and copyright piracy online.
Hansen also pointed out that.

given I lie tight computer security
011 campus, there are other com
puter security issues that should
demand more consideration than
a computer virus attack.
Consultants at Sweet llall are
quick to remind users of the im
portance ofloggingout from their
I.eland accounts. Forgetting this
simple action leaves a student's ac
count. vulnerable toe-mail fraud.
\nv user can access one's e-mail
and send messages without their
knowledge from their account.
In the past, hackers targeted
key institutions — military bases,
government offices, even academ
ic institutions — for access to con
fidential information. However,
according to Hansen, most virus
attacks these days are automated
and hackers are only looking for
fast connections. The virus re
views servers across the entire In
ternet for whatever system is op
erating on a fast network. I sing a
virus attack, hackers hope to take
over these systems and launch a
powerful attack to wipe out their
opponents in an "on-line war."
