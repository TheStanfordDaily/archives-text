# President Bush makes controversial stem cell decision
## 
### VIC REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After keeping the country
guessing for the summer. Presi
dent George VV. Bush revealed on
Aug. 9 that federal money will he
used for embryonic stem cell re
search. Hoping to find a middle
ground in a complex hioethics de
hate, Bush has opted to fund sci
entific work on 60 existing stem
cell lines but not fund any work
that will cause more embryos to l>e
destroyed.
In a telecast from his ranch in
Crawford, Texas, the president
thoroughly explained his reason
for choosing to only bankroll re
search on cells "where the life
•ind-death decision has already
been made."
" This allows us to explore the
promise and potential of stem cell
research without crossing a fun
damental moral line by providing

taxpayer funding that would
sanction or encourage further de
struction of human embryos that
have at least the potential for life,"
Bush said.

Privately
funded research
has provided the
existing stem
cell lines.
"'There seem
to have been
sixty lines creat
ed throughout
the world," said
Paul Berg, Bio
chemistry Cahill

Prof, in (lancer Research, Knier- J
it us. "I think that's sufficient to fl
get started, and to be able to
work with those and find out
whether those are any good and
whether we need them. I he name
of the game is that you have to do
research to answer the questions."
Berg said that he is somewhat

satisfied with Bush's decision.
"1 think it's a reasonable com-

promise," he said.
" There are certain
parts that have to

be worked
out, but for
the moment it
looks like peo-

' l
pie who want to
work on this will have
iccess to those lines

and if they're any good
they'll make some progress."
Biology graduate student
Pedro (iutierre/. is not happy with
Bush's plan because it does not
completely bloc k embryonic stem

cell research. "(Using existing cell
lines still] dishonors the earthly
remains of the embryos that were
killed," he said.
Nationally, Bush has been criti
cized by both proponents and op
ponents of embryonic stem cell re
search — either for unreasonably
restricting a promising area of re
search or for compromising his
pro-life position.
"1 am not going to change my
mind," Bush said on Monday.
"Any pit-ce of legislation that un
dermines what 1 think is right will
Ik* vetoed."
I Tie White I louse plan calls for
an advisory panel on stem cell re
search. Dr. Leon Kass, a well-re
spected University of Chicago Prof,
in the Committee for Social
I "bought, will head the panel, which
will formulate medical guidelines
and look at the ethical questions as
sociated with this new field.
"I'm a long-time friend of Leon

kass and I use his writings in some
of my c lasses," said Bioethics Prof .
William Hurlbut. "I have very
great respect for his serious and
scholarly approach to issues in
medical ethics."
Kass has often stated his oppo
sition to cloning, hut his views on
embryonic stem cell research are
not well known.
In the end. one of the summer's
hottest political issue — the stem
cell debate — prompted the first
major science policy decision by the
Bush administration and even had
our often tongue-tied president
waxing poetic.
"We have arrived at that brave
new world that seemed so distant
in 1932, when Aldous Huxley
wrote alxnit human beings creat
ed in test tubes in what he called a
hatchery," he said during last
Thursday's telecast. Bush and
Kass will work together to make a
moral map for this new reality.
