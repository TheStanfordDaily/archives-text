Because Antarctica's Southern
()(can contains a large ({iiantits ol
untapped resources, An igo is
using modeling lo deterinine the
feasil)iln\ of "fertili/ing" the sea to
increase phvtoplankton popula
tions and dee rease c arbon dioxide
levels. Wording to Arrigo, an es
senlial element largels missing
from the Southern Ocean is iron.
I n tlieoi \, dumping massive eglan
tines of iron into the Southern
Ocean would augment the phvto
plankton populations. However,
there could be unwanted side ef

I hough Ai i igo is (in i cniK
working <>11 methods to reduce
carbon dioxide levels, his previ
ous research lonised on ways in
which increased levels of carbon
dioxide and atmospheric temper
ature could have adverse effects
on t he ecos\stem.
Arrigo fin used ion two specific
tvpes of Southern Ocean phvto
planktou: I'haeocvstis antarctica
.ind diatoms. While studying the ef

I nfortunatclv, relative to I'baeocvs
tis. diatoms don't lake in as mix h

"It's ,i positive feedback system,"
An igo s.iid. "('.arbon dioxide levels
go up, temperatures go up, the
oceans stratih Ix'cause of increased
prc<ipitation — which favors di
atoms — so( arbon dioxide lev els go
up even higher."
I lie results from this research
were a springboard for another
topic Arrigo is c urrentl\ studying:

to grow around December.
"Some people predicted tli.it the
o/one hole would lead to the demise
of the Southern ()< can ecosystem,"'
Arrigo said.
Some of Anigo's research is
being funded In the Department of
K.nergy, \vhi( h is interested in look
ing f< >i ways to lower carlion dioxide
levels without having to reduce
.America's industrial productivity.
" I his is the one thing tli.it gives
me pause, said Arrigo, who be
lieves that conservation is still the
best way to combat high carbon
dioxide emission levels.
According to Arrigo, the oceans
and Ibrcsts'capability for absorbing
carlxm dioxide may ultimately be
exceeded.
"Then it's all going to be in the at
mosphere, and we're going to have
a real problem on our hands," Arri
t>o said.
