that highlight the disadvantages ol
ethanol as an alternative fuel. Ac
eording to l).i\i<l Pimcntel. the 1111-
dei King flaw 111 ethanol is thai more
energN needed to make ethanol
from grain than is pioduced In its
combustion: A gallon ol ethanol
vields 77,000 IVl'l's but recjuires
I 1.000 to produce.
Pimentel suggested other rea
sons to discourage ethanol use. I 01
example, the energy used to make
ethanol is derived from fossil fuels,
s( i the net conservation is essentially
non-existent. So why not use
ethanol-based products to harvest
its energv? 1 lie answer lies in the

cost: fossil fuels cost only $o.9f> per
gallon to produce, whereas ethanol
i osts $1.74.
