I nder the formula of "one country , two
systems." a term coined by (China's former
leader Deng Xiaoping, Hong Kong be
came a separate autonomous government
under Chinese rule on July I, 1997. It re
tained its c apitalist economic system, Eng
lish common law judiciary and a politic al
ly neutral civil service. Constitutionally,
Hong Kong is governed by a mini-consti
tution called the Basic Law.
Among other things, the Basic Law
calls fora gradual democratization of

partial direct elections in the legislature
until 2007.
"After 2007, the government system is
up for grabs," Ip said. She said that the

government and Hong Kong c itizens will
need to start thinking about what kind ol
government they would like to have.
But no matter what, Ip said that ci\il
servants in I long Kong need to adapt to
the changing climate.
Ip touched on the role of the People's
Liberation's Army in I long Kong since the
transition.
"For very important constitutional rea
sons, defense is not our responsibility," Ip
said. " I he l'L\ does not do internal sec u
rity. II say, we get attacked In missiles from
I aiwan, that's the I'LA's responsibility."
Allegations of spying
Several controversies that have been

phone call from President Ceorge W.
Bush to Chinese President |iang Zemin
on la's behalf.
I hen, in a test ol I long Kong's auton
omy, l.i tried to return to Hong Kong to
resume his academic post, even though
he had been convicted ol spying on the
mainland.
"Our decision to allow him to come
back to work was attacked by pro-Beijing
[people],' Ip said, "j 1 hey said] we allowed
a spy in."
l|> pointed out tli.it under
immigration regulations, Hong
Kong's government i* entitled
to disallow an\ undesirables
without right ol resident \ in
Hong Kong from coming in.
But, "you can hide behind na
tional security, we could [elect
not to] allow [l.i| to come be
cause he is a convic ted sp\. On
the other hand, Mr. I.i started
working in Hong Kong |in|

|,tiid 1 has |a| wife and c hild in
Hong Kong. He u.is two years
away from (having the| right <>!

In addition to humanitarian
reasons, Ip said that il the gov

there was the possibility that
the decision would be chal

lenged in Hong Kong's courts,
and that fact was taken into

Another c ontroversv that has
readied Ip's desk is the Falun

Chinese government has said it
is a dangerous threat to societ).

Beijing government has good
reason to be worried."
But Ip reaffirmed Hong

One Country, Two Systems
I nder the formula of "one country , two

Hong Kong is governed by a mini-consti

Among other things, the Basic Law
calls fora gradual democratization of

partial direct elections in the legislature
until 2007.
"After 2007, the government system is
