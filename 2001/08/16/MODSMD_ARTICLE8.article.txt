# Stanford profs question stem cell lines policy

### SCOTT DORFMAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
List I Inirsday's decision In President
Bnsli to allow leder.il funding for research on
.1 numlKT of existing embryonic stem cell lines
has been greeted with a mixture of praise and
criticism from the Stanford medical communi
ty, who said they were pleased that research
would be allowed but felt the President should
have gone further.
Hush announced that federal mone\
could be used to conduct studies on cells
harvested from embryos left over at fert ilit \
clinics, but could not be utilized for re
search tli.it eithei creates 01 destroys addi
tional human embryos. Recently, research
has largely been conducted at privately'-
funded biotechnology companies, with fed
eral funding for ac ademia barred.
"While we are pleased that there is not a
total ban on federal support lor human em
bryonic stem iell research. 1.1111 disappoint
ed about the restrictions and limitations
that exist," said Philip A. Pizzo, the ('ail and
Klizabeth Naumann Prof, of Pediatrics and
of Microbiology and Immunology and
Dean of the School of Medicine. "Ii would
have been much better if the scientific com
munity had ac cess to the fertilized eggs that
remain unused or potentially are discarded
following successful in vitro fertilization.
While the current policy will permit re
search on human embryonic stem cells to
continue, the pace will be slower."
According to Paul Berg, the Robert W.

Pizzo said that while some Stan

process still ver\ much in its infant \.
" I here remains a tremendous
amount ol \cr\ b.isi( research to be
done to determine how embryonic
stem cells grow and flourish in vari

said. "While there is enormous
promise in stem cell research lor re
placement or repair of damaged or
gans, these applications are still
promissory and will onh come from
careful investigation.
"While at the present Stanford
m ientisLsare not working on human
embryonic stem cells — compared
to non-human stem cells — there is
even' reason to believe that they
would be studied in the future."
One part of Bush's announce
ment that raised some eyebrows in
the scientific community was his
proclamation th.it 60 embryonic
stein cell lines currently exist lor re
search purposes.
"Personally, 1 was stunned by the
figure of HO," Berg said. "Most peo
ple believed there were onlv a half
dozen or a do/en existing embnon
ic stem cell lines. We onh knew of
onccompam that possesses six."
"I and a number ol membci sol
the Stanford Medical St liool coin

inunity were surprised l>\ the an
nouncement that there were (i() t ell
lines in existence," h//<> said.
"However, I have been told In .1
highh respected colleague that this
may he true."
Regardless of the number of ex
isting lines, gaining access to embry
onic stem cells for research could be
extremeK difficult for Stanford s<i
entists. Significant cjuestions remain
as to the quality and availabiliu o|
embryonic stem cells, according to
I'izzo and Berg.
"We do not know the diver
stiy and status of these reputed
embryonic stem cell lines," l'i//<>
said. "Moreover, we do not
know whether the current num
ber of embryonic stem cell lines
will permit the robust research
agenda that should otherwise be
realized."
"It has yet to be determined
whether the stem cell lines are
going to be any good or free of pro
prietary ties," Berg said. "We will
only know the answers to these
questions when we get a registet ol
the lines."
And a larger question remains
as to whether embryonic stem cell
research really does hold the ke\ to
curing diseases that have baffled
scientists for decades, including
Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's
Disease, and Juvenile Diabetes.
"We do believe that there is
enormous promise [in embryon
ic stein cell research], hut we
have to do the science to sec- it
the promise can be fulfilled.'
Berg said. "The proof is in the
pudding."
