### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Santa Clara County needs to establish
protective zoning fort he Stanford Foothills
and Stanford needs to complete a sustain
able development stuch. according to a re
port l>\ environmental organizations.
Fight months ago in December, the
Santa C.lara Cionnt\ Hoard of Supervi
sors accepted the Stanford (!ommnnit\
Plan and the 2000 (ieneral I se Perm it.
I he (louim is responsible for oversee
ing the polic\ implementations, which
outline the conditions rec mired tor the
I nivcrsii\'s development of tip to five
million square leet.
I heCiommittecfor (ireen Foothillsand
Stanford Open Space Alliance rated
progress in five areas, including imple
mentation of hillside zoning, formation of a
community resource group, creation of a
sustainable development study, develop
ment of a spec ial conservation area plan
and trail dedications.
I lie report concluded that three of the
five commitments are progressing in a
timely and effective manner. I lie ( xninty is
forming the community resource group,
the special conservation area plan is in de
velopment and potential trails have been
identified.
However, "two of the most important
open space protection measures" have

seen inadequate progress, according lo die
Committee. Hie establishment of protec
tive zoning lor the Foothills has not been
s< hedulcd yet, nor has the sustainable de
velopment study, which will direct future
development on I diversity land. 1 "he
County must approve this study before
Stanford can begin the second phase of de
velopment granted by the 2000 Ceneral
I se Permit.
I liese projects are "complex and will
require a lengthy process," according to
the Committee. It recommends that the
County commit to a start and comple
tion date for each.
I he sustainable development study is
expected to be a contentious point, as it
will establish the maximum huildout po
tential allowed on Stanford lands and
ensure that Stanford cannot continue to
grow indefinitely.
It took, two vears and 40 public meet
ings to approve the [ permit | and coinmuni
tv plan. I'etet Drekmeier, director of the
Alliance, said, "hut even with all that work,
we essentially postponed the big decision,
which is how big Stanford University
should be allowed to grow. From this expe
rience, we (an expect the sustainable devel
opment study to take quite aw hile, yet there
has been virtually no progress to date."
Drekmeier said this lack of progress
should worry Stanford bccause the Uni
versity's plans for its second million square
feet of academic development cannot
Ix-gin until the study is concluded.
