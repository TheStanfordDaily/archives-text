## DAILY VIEWPOINT Pragmatism: The coward's ideology 
### JEREMY KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
With its atmosphere of shitting
pragmatic morals and morass of
compromise, the cluttered world we
inhabit inherently questions our will
to remain stalwart in our beliefs and
to make the difficult decision.
This is the world of politics; a
world where one can proudly pro
claim oneself a hold pragmatist,
and, rather than being laughed out
ol the building, be elected to public
office, even the presidency. Howev
er, we must recognize that this world
affects us in profound ways.
Politics is life, and life has he
come politics. Look at the debates
that have raged within the country
this year alone: whether govern
ment was better qualified to spend
your money than you were;
whether science was allowed to
continue to evolve; who decides
elections. Politics is everywhere,
and its mass must be placed upon
our shoulders one incremental
brick at a time, lest we be crushed
beneath the Atlas weight.
Now is the age of The Third Way
and Compassionate Conservatism,
an age in which a new form of poli
tics affects everv conceivable aspect
of our daily lives. And this age is not
dominated by one side or one ide
ology. Both political parties are
waging a battle to propagate new
political ideologies that seek to ob
fuscate the sides ol the traditional
one. But why are those ideologies
suddenly out of vogue? Is it that
traditional political thought has no
place in modern politics? That
times have changed and politics,
like technology, is not immune to
the pressures of evolution?
Put simply, this blurring of
thought began with the intrusion of
politics into the very fabric of our
lives. The right to choose, the right
to tax, the right to death, the right to
education, the right to life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness have
all become political questions. Into
the debates surged the political par
ties, believing that they had the right

— and, more importantly, from
their perspective, the responsibility
to decide these questions and
many more like them. Politics has
infringed on the everyday, render
ing the everyday political.
Taking only one of the elements
of the new political pragmatism —
language — we can see how dan
gerous and evasive politics, and
therefore, leadership, has become.
Examine the language closely and
you will discover several tenets of
political language.
The Democrats struck first with
their slogan, The Third Way. After
the 1988 presidential election, em
barrassed by another sorrowful de
feat, the party was in a free-fall and
desperately struggling to recover a
voice that connected with voters.
They found one in Creat Britain's
Labour Party's highly successful
pragmatist scheme, titled The
Third Way — the new, more accept
able, middle-of-the-road centrisin.
The Democratic Leadership Coun
cil and its champion, Bill Clinton,
gave the Democratic Party an ideo
logical face-lift by repackaging the
Democrats as fiscally responsible
and, more importantly, as centrists
who had found a way out of the en
tanglements of partisan politics. De
mocrats proclaimed that they were
no longer your typical socialist New
Dealers or partisan ideologues.
Democrats argued that politics
had become about the two parties
and their ossified and beleaguered
ideologies. The New Democrats im
plemented a plan that sought to t.ike
the Democratic mantle — liberalism
and moderate it. With their slo
gan, the New Democrats proudly
announced that the old politics and
the political parties were historical
anomalies that had run their course.
Conservatism and liberalism were
entities of the past, antiques that no
longer held a place in the political
world; the future demanded a new
way, a third way. By appearing to
have the best of both worlds — fiscal
responsibility and concern for the
poor and uneducated — what other
choice could there be?

Voters agreed and delivered the
Democrats, riding their wave of
pragmatism, to two consecutive
terms in the Oval Office and public
support rarelv seen fora president.
But when A1 Gore attempted to
broaden the concentric circle of The
Third Way to include a broad pop
ulism, it overwhelmingly failed to
connect with voters and the Democ -
rats lost the White House. (Of
course, this depends on an accep
tance of the Supreme Court's mon
umental decision.)
Knter the raging Republicans.
Spurred on by negative reactions to
the Gingrich Revolution and by the
ulcers obtained from helplessly
watching Boh Dole look like the
harder and more ideologically calci
fied candidate in his ill-fated con
frontation with the- nimble Clinton,
the Republican Party dug in and
gave itself a makeover.
Republicans constructed a para
pet of pragmatism, spec iously titled
Compassionate Conservatism, and
found a poster-hoy in George W.
Bush. Running from everything Re
publican — the Religious Right,
abolishing the Department of Edu
cation, welfare hashing, and Affir
mative axing — candidate Bush
stole the pragmatist wreath from the
Democrats and used it to outwit
them and the voters. Bush is now in
office implementing his Compas
sionate Conservatism, and Democ
rats have more than just the stolen
election to be upset about.
In the wake of pragmatism, poli
tics has become the art of the short
term solution. Why do we need a
tax-cut? Because the economy was
slowing down and vitally needed a
boost. In this singular debate, very
little concern was given to the long
term implications. The debate cen
tered on the quick-fix, the "now" so
lution — the political solution.
The farthest reaching and most
worrisome problem facing us is So
cial Technology. Instead of bold so
lutions and visionary impulses, the
issue has produced a tangled web of
inexact attempts, one of which
would financially ruin our govern

ment. We talk long-term and act
short-term. "Give us results," is the
political cry. What have you done
for me lately?
Is this what we, as voters, are
looking lor — our politicians to ap
pear every lew months to trot out a
new initiative that pretends to solve
the problem?
1 hope not. What we need are
men and women who can envision
the long term, who can imagine the
future <>1 the country and invest
their minds and energies in that,
rather than in the present and the
votes to be won.
I 'nt.il those people step forward,
we, as a nation, sit on the precipice
of partisan politics, even alter listen
ing to lengthy dissertations assert
ing otherwise. The "spirit of Wash
ington" will not change soon — not
in Bush's tenure and, peering into
the distant horizon and seeing only
mirages in the glare of the veneered
ideology, not anvtime soon. So what
can we expect ol our politicians?
The answer rests in the very virtues
we must expect of ourselves.
We must not allow ourselves to be
sucked into the quicksand of prag
matism where the only way to safety
is the first stick we are offered. We
must be men and women who be
lieve in a vision and work to spread
it to the world. We must remember
that democracy is an investment
that requires long-term commit
ment, which, in turn, allows short
term solutions.
All heroes — and, by heroes, 1
mean men and women who dare to
dream — maintain a glorious vision
of the world that stands in contrast
to the world we live in. And each of
those heroes had the audacity, the
virtue, the courage to sacrifice prag
matism at the altar of belief in some
thing greater. We need visionaries,
not pragmatists; we want heroes
who act, not storekeepers who ac
cept. What we need is hope; what we
need is the courage to be.
