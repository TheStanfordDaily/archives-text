### ARTHUR LIAO CELENE CHAN 
Twenty of the Hay Area's
brightest students part it ipatcd in
a summer internship program
conducted by Stanford's ('.enter
for ('.linnal Immunology.
Most of the interns were high
school juniors and senior s. I hey
did lab work, listened to lectures
and went on various educational
field trips.
The program was started last
year by C. Carrisou Katham, di
rector of the Center, and Alan
Krensky, professor of pediatrics.
I\J. IJtz, professor of immunolo
gy and rheumatology, and the
Center's manager, l.u Km YVell
hausen, are co-directors of the
program.
The interns spent much of
their time working in one of 111
different labs, and some interns
doubled up to work in the same
lab. Ut/ and other faculty mem
bers lectured approximately 2
hours each week.
The program also allowed for
field trips, which provided the in
terns with a chance to see such
things as glowing mice (a gene in
serted into the mice's genomes
caused the glowing phenome
non) and a video camera that can

i ecord t ell movement.
According to I t/ and YVell
hausen, the purpose of the pro
gram is to stimulate the students'
interest in research and encour
age them to ultimately choose a
vocation th.it involves scientific
resean h.
"We're hoping that these kids
will go on to medical and gradu
ate school and do research as
part of their career," Ut/ said.
I hr interns had to submit a
resume, obtain letters of recom
mend.ition and compose a one
page essay about why spending .1
summer doing research would
be worthwhile.
I : t/ did the initial screening of
the nearly 70 applicants and a
committee chose the final 20. All
of the interns chosen had taken
some biology or (hemistry ionis
es .Hid had I.O(Â»PA's.
In addition, some of the lu
teins had a disease or knew
someone with .1 disease.
The Center compensated the
students for their work over the
course of the summer. Ihe stu
dents received stipends because
"|tlie directors] figured if they
had spent their summer working
elsewhere they would have
earned some money," VVell
hausen said.

lit/ said that, in choosing their
interns lor the summer, he and the
committee were looking lor appli
cants with .1 genuine interest in
doing research in a field ol st ietu e.
"We were really looking lor
people who didn't do the pro
gram (list so they could put it on
their (curriculum vitaej and at tu
ally had a sincere interest in
doing research," Utz said.
YVellhausen and I t/ agreed
th.it the interns gained a great
deal ol knowledge ol both re
search let hni(]ues and the field of
immunology and enjoyed the
program a great deal.
" There was so much positive
feedback from the kids; they
were telling their friends about it
and how fun it was, and their en
thusiasm makes it fun for us,"
YVellhausen said.
Wellhausen said that the
Center is considering enlarging
the program next year in order
to be able to take on more in
terns, but she added that this
may be difficult because ol fi
nancial issues.
The center does not receive
any funding from Stanford. The
internship program is complete
ly funded by private donors and
the Northern California Arthritis
Foundation.
