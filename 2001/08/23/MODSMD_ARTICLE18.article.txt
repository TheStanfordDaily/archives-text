Ifs rare in college spoils loi .1
new coat li to lake over .1 ton team
and improve it in his first season.
It's rarer still for that coach to take
his team straight into a national
title hunt.
Yet that's what new Stan lord
men's soccer coach Bret Simon is
looking to do in 2001. and the (car
dinal have the talent and the depth
to ba< k him up. Despite losing one
the best senior classes in school his
tor\. the squad will once again look
to challenge for the national cham
pionship.
Simon, the head coach last veai
for national runner-up (acighton,
headlines an all-new coaching stall
installed after the abrupt depar
ture of Bobby Clark for the head
coaching spot at Notre Dame.
Simon, who took the Blue Javs to
the national title game twice in his
six-war lenureand racked up a 0(>-
29-0 retotd along the wav. brings
assistants Matt Stimson and |aro
/aw islan from ()maha with him.

I he largest task Simon faces is
replacing the vaunted class of
2001: forwards laike Rust and
( <>rc\ W'oolfolk. midfielders Rvan
Nelsen, Scott Leber and Scan
Svlvis. defender Chris Cores and
perhaps the most devastating loss,
goalkeeper Adam /apala, who
leaves the Farm atop the careei
lisis for goals-against average,
shutouts, minutes, games played
and games started.
All told, last year's senioi t lass at -
((Minted for 43 of the team's (><S
goals ((>.V2'<) and 2'i of the 71 .is
sists (,'V2.l'i). as well as providing
the backbone of the nation's most
potent defense, which finished the
season with a \'( 'AVbest 0.4-1 (Â«A\.
On the individual level, Nelsen
was honored with Pacific 10 Con
ference Plaver of the Year and
first-team All-America selections,
while he. W'oolfolk and /.apala
were all chosen in February's MI S
SuperDralt (4th. 13 and4oth over
all. respectively).
Fortunately for Simon, al
though the extraordinan breadth
which gave the Cardinal 10 plavci s

with double-digit points totals last
year is depleted, the players left on
the squad aren't exactb without
talent. Standout performers at
every position remain, and a selec
tion ol gifted newt oinei s will keep
the squad in contention.
Senior l.ee Morrison will In
die leader on defense, the Cardi
nal's strength in recent years. Al
ready named one of 15 finalists
for the 2001 Hermann Trophy,
the sport's Mcismau lroph\
equivalent, Morrison will look to
improve on last year's all-confer
ence season.
Morrison will join juniors l odd
Dunivant (an All-l'ac-10 team
mate) and l'avlor (iraham, as well
as senior Aaron Middle, as priman
contributors in thebac kfield. Duni
vant finished second in assists on
the team last year, v\ith nine, and
looks primed to continue a Stan
ford tradition of scoring defenders.
