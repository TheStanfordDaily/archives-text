his team straight into a national
title hunt.

men's soccer coach Bret Simon is
looking to do in 2001. and the (car

to ba< k him up. Despite losing one
the best senior classes in school his

to challenge for the national cham

Simon, the head coach last veai
for national runner-up (acighton,
headlines an all-new coaching stall
installed after the abrupt depar

coaching spot at Notre Dame.
