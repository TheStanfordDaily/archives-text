# Scooters find true home among extreme athletes

### 
Inspiration struck me
tcxiay. KSI'N s Summer \
(lames, a yearly festival of
"extreme" sports competi
tions, is current!) taking place in
Pittsburgh. Although events like
niotoctoss, street luge, and skv-

surfing have
proven robust
enough to hold
the vounger
generation's at
tention lor mot e
than a single
summer, the or
ganizers are con
stantly on the
lookout loi the

' 'rv* nil lUI till
newest new tiling, an event so hi
dicroush death-defving it will
prove exciting enough for
today's stamps, raised on a
stead\ diet of "Jackass, Hie
Matrix and I-ruitx Pebbles laced
with amphetamines.

I have that new thing. What
tilt- \ Games need are scooters.
You've seen them around,
the Razor and its cheaper
knockofls; they look like two
wheeled aluminum skateboards
with a pole lor handles attached
to the front. They've been big in
the pre-teen set, being cheaper
than rollerblades and easier
than skateboards.
During the height of their
popularity last summer, you'd
see the occasional necktied busi
nessman zooming down the
streets of Palo Alto on one, no
doubt believing himself to l<><>k
attractively quirky and young at
heart, rather than (as was reall\
the case) looking as though his
mother wouldn't give him the
kevs to the car.

Skateboarding legend Tony Hawk (above) and
partner Andy Macdonald look cool — but they'd
look way cooler flying around on scooters.
