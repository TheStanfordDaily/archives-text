## 'Rat Race' takes the cheese 
### CHARLES SCHOONOVER 
I n .1 genre t hat all too often re
lics on rehashed conventions to
get laughs. "Rat Race" deserves
i red it foi being distinct. Opting
against the hilarity ol glue-in
liand sc\ incidents and cultural
h diverse crime-lighting duos,
u i iter Andrew Bret knian and di
i ectoi |errv /inker instead find
humor in situations like an er
i am \ I'L referee who sneaks his
wax onto a bus lull ol l.ut ilie ball
impel sonators. I "lie result is a
movie that is at times tremen
dous and at times Hat-out

strange, but alwa\s worth recog
nition lot its tjuirkiness.
1 lie premise of the film is that
Donald Sinclait. .1 billionaii e I .as
Vegas casino-owner plavetl b\
101111 ('.lease, has decided to woo
finant ial big wigs b\ giving them
a one-of-a-kind gambling experi
ence. I It' has placed $2 million in
a New Mexico locker, and his
guests must bet on which of si\
pursuing parties will get to it first.
Although one initialb cannot
find excitement in watt hing peo
ple go after .1 pri/c that is onl\
two states axvax, the (losing ol the
I.as Vegas Airport soon changes
everyone's course. Before long,
the contestants are hoarding
everything from horses to hot-aii
balloons 111 search of the treasure.
I lie most impressive thing
about the chaos that ensues is the
cast involved. In addition to( lease,
the film's list of stars includes
Rowan Atkinson as .111 Italian nar
coleptic, (oil I .ox it/ as a roguish

lamilv-man who steals 11 itlt'i "s cat
from a group ol Neo-Nazis, and
(!ul>Â«i< ><>oding |i. as the aforemen
tioned referee. Whoopi (ioldberg.
Hreckin Me\er, Seth (ircen, \m\
Smart, Dean (lain. katln Hates.
|oan C.usak and the h.md Smash
mouth also make appearances in
van iilg degi ees.
Despite this all-star line up,
something about the lilm pre
vents n from being among the
ranks of i lassit comedies. I'et
haps one can onl\ handle so
main ol \tkinsons Mr. Hean
es(jue facial expressions or so
much ol Jon l.ovit/'s Jon I.ovitz
ness before wishing for some
thing else. 1 hough Hreckman
and /tu ker should be commend
ed for tailoring to each actor's
coinedu st\ le. some of the actors
themselves are an acquired taste.
And, with so many big names
aboard, the film runs the risk of
not reaching enough viewers
who will like all of the humor.

Fortunately, finding someone
who doesn't laugh numerous
times during Ins or het viewing
will be equally as diflioult. Al
though there may he disagree
ments over whit h portion of the

humor is most impressive, every
one will find pari of (lie movie hi
larious. The film is worth watch
ing even if onh because of the nu
merous brands of comedy that it
manages to produce.
