THE ROAD HOME
ZHANG YIMOU
SONY PICTURES CLASSIC
PLAYING EVERYWHERE
I _J

malic acting c hops 111 " I lu- Road
Home.' I Itimatcly falling short
of greatness, this love story is
beamifully portrayed, even
though it lacks a great plot.
Zi-Yi plays l>i, the most beauti
ful unmarried woman in a small
mainland China town. She cap
tures the eye ol Luo Yu-Sheng
(Sun Hong-Lei), the town's first
school teacher — who also hap
pens to be an eligible bachelor. l)i
desperately begins pursuing Luo
while he goes on walks with his

students, to the degree of almost
becoming a quasi-stalkcr.
Since the story is told in flash
backs, von know that the two
eventually marry. " I he Road
Home" compensates for this bv
lodising 011 how the two met and
their ensuing courtship. I he en
tire film depends on the romantic
energy between the couple, and,
for the most part, I'd say that one

i.m understand the love felt be
tween them.
But I also feel that the movie
dragged a bit through various
plot complications (an extended
separation, class conflict, etc.),
,md I would have preferred to
have more action set in the pre
sent era.

Peek-a-boo, I see you.
Zi-Yi continues to impress me
with her acting and beauty. I am
sure that she, along with the film's
cinematography, is why "The
Road I lome" picked up the Audi
ence Award at Sundance and the
Silver Bear at the Berlin Festival.
But beautiful scenery and at
tractive actors do not make up lor
the shortcomings of the film's
plot. Director Zhang Yimou, who
previously worked on the far su
perior "To live" and "Shanghai
Iliad," has almost put a death
knell in the traditional Chinese
film niche l)\ using manipulative
orchestral chords and slow-mov
ing melodrama.
"The Road Home" is by no
means a terrible film. It sits on
the border of whether or not I'd
recommend the film — which,
during the summer, equates to a
slightK favorable review. You
c «m certainly do a lot worse with
some of the bilge in the multi
plexes today.
I would urge those who want to
see a different side of Zi-Yi to catch
this movie near the end of its run
or, perhaps more wisely, to wait
for the subsequent video release.
