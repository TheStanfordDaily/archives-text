This gripping exchange just
about captures the tone of the en
tire film. The lines are just silly
enough that you consider laugh
ing, but they also tap into a unique
ly American nostalgia that keeps us
rooting for the baby outlaws. And
most of the movie — from the plot
to the landscape to the other char
acters — seems to be an elaborate
exercise in worshipping both Tar
tell and Jesse James.
Older brother Frank (Gabriel
Maiht) and cousin Gole (Scott

Caan) serve
more to round
out Jesse's
character than
anything else;

bravado more than compensates

and ready smile, which are some
what liss than American outlaw
like.
What's more, the film's villains,
railroad tycoon I haddeus Rains
(Harris Yulin) and Secret Service
detective Allan I'inkei ton (Timotln
Dalton), are s<> one-ditnensionallv

to a lilt' of rob
bing banks to
keep their
homes and
avenge their
inoth e r ' s
death.
As if the
obvious wor
thiness o! these
motives wasn't

enough, we have Rains malu iousl\
littering such lines as, "I'll teach
these pod links what happens when
tht'\ i hallenge the righteousness of
progress." What better wa\ to ap
peal to the capitalist apologist in all
of us, keeping the intelligent movie
goer at ba\ long enough for us to
enjoy what can only Ik* called the
kitschiness of "American (hitlaws."
I hough this film is hardly true
to James's life and docs little more
than incorporate cowl)o\ hats and
horses to justify tailing itself a
"Western," the ston is still one we
can get excited about. Ihe fight
scenes are also fun to watch, and
the dialogue is a riot. (You can just
see the cast fall to pieces saving

lines like, "Don't come
bat k when von find you
can't farm with a Nix
gun," and,"I wish I
could hang you every
single morning fora
(entun.")
\lso to the film's
credit, the romance be
tween (esse and /ee
Minims (Ali Larter)
doesn't do the film in, as
might be expected. It is
handled peripheralh
and with a smirk, so
much so that we can al
most overlook the fail
that it i>« both underde
veloped .ind uninterest
ing, if'onlv because we're
too busy thanking our
lu< k\ stars for the bless-

ing of jnsi «i few bad love scenes
and romantic monologues.
If this movie meant to lie seri
ous. then it failed miserably, but
it's probahh sale to give the direc
tor and cast the benefit of the
doubt on tbi> one. Let s assume
that the\ made the smart decision

to use a good-looking cast and
flash) action to (ash in on the
largely teenage summer movie au
dience — and, in the process,
made a movie th.it admittedh
won't leave vou questioning life,
but su< ceeds enough to put .1 smile
on vour face.
