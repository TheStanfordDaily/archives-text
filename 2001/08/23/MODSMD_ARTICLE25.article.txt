I lie- book continues with the
179S slavery debate in tln-
House ol Representatives,
which produced speeches ili.it
formed the basis ol the Seces
sionists' arguments in the inid
nineteenth i entui \ It also ex
amines Washington's farewell
address, the second presiden
tial elect ion between | oh n
Adams and |efferson and the
relationship between \dams
and Jefferson — which pro
duced one of t lie gi eat est i ollec -
tions ol pi imary documents
about the Revolution.u\ peri
od, (lontinent.il Congress and
early Republic. It concludes
witli Adams and |effei son d\ ing
011 the same day, July K less
than five hours apart.
Kllis' book is yet another
modernist attempt to look back
at history from the precipice ol
the present, but Kllis is careful
to declare his intentions from

I he beginning. I his admission
allows him to provide a few
pieces of fresh evidence on lop
it s like whether Hamilton trnlv
fired his weapon, who wrote
Washington's farewell address
.md what were Jefferson's (ac
tus during his vice presidentv
.md non-campaign of 1»S()() —
while casting his projections
into the modern era.
Kllis' study of the effects of
the founding of political parties
is a novel and important ana In -
sis to he mentioned, and he
works his assumption through
his six incidents.
Unlike other historical revo
lutions before and after the
American Revolution, once the
halt It's secured independence
our forefathers ttauslormed
the murderous impulses that
liistoi ma 11 \ follow post-inde
pendence into .1 political solu
tion — the\ formed parties.
I his division allowed the fore
fathers to safelx debate volatile
issues sm h as slaver\. isolation
ism, expansion and the role of
government without fear of
murderous reprisal. I bis, I- llis
proclaims, was the most impor
tant contribution of the
founders to the I nited States.
1 n our time of political and

social upheaval, it is important
to realize where it all began and
how far we have come. I his
hook is important not because
it attempts to settle six difficult
historical questions, hut be
cause it attempts to show how
we came from a colony and
transformed ourselves, with
difficulty and some pain, into
the longest lasting Republic in
history.
