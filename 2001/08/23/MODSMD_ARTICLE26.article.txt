## On this farm there lived a fish: Solving sustainable aquaculture Despite advances in modern technology, something about fish – eries still smells fishy 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
What do salmon in the At
lantic. shrimp in I long Kong and
i arp in Finland have in common?
I heir decline in numbers —
often blamed on pollution — is
the result of over-fishing, accord
ing to scientists.
In the 19505, aquaculture was
hailed as a solution to two prob
lems: satisfying increasing food
demand and not depleting the
ocean's natural resources. Fish
would be raised and harvested in
large numbers at optimal condi
tions without harming their re
spective ecosystems.
In the past decade a consensus
has emerged in the scientific
community that over-fishing has
created more problems than it
has solved. Despite attempts to
manage populations, commercial
fishing creates imbalance in
ecosystems.
I he American Association for
the Advancement of Science
holds an annual conference on
fishing every February. The last

meeting, held in San Francisco,
ended with a joint statement call
ing for sustainable fishing to
"help the world create a new era."
At Stanford, there are several
important names in the field ol
fisheries research.
Rosamond Naylor, a senior
fellow at the Institute for Interna
tional Studies, has actively called
for adoption of "more ecological
ly sound management practices."
Joshua Eagle, coordinator of
the Stanford Fisheries Project .it
the Law School, is currently di
recting a worldwide effort to in
fluence national policies.
Barbara Block, an associate
professor in marine sciences, has
established the Tuna Research
and Conservation ('.enter to sup
port research on tuna and blue
fish stock in the Atlantic.
Impact on Ecosystem
Fisheries alter marine ecosys
tems directly, by removing a
large fraction of the biomass of
coastal and offshore resources at
all higher trophic levels. Trophic
levels are the segments of the
food chain: For instance, plant
eating fish are at a lower trophic
level than meat-eating fish.
In addition, fisheries have in
direct effects by altering the food
supply of the remaining marine
predators and by damaging bot
tom habitats.

"Aquaculturc is not just fann
ing fish," said Men I Williams, the
director of "ICLARM flu-
World Fishing Center" in
Malaysia. "Ii involves a wide
range of changes — economic,
social, perhaps even political —
in human communities." 1 he
center conducts sustainable fish
ing projects worldwide.
According to Williams, aqua
culture has responded well to in
creasing demand for fish supph.
but has created new problems lor
humanity.
Block stated two of these chal
lenges: international policy and
lack of knowledge.
"Tunas are highly migratory
species and their large-scale
movement brings them to many
countries," Block said. "Kffestive
ly, they are fish without a coun
try. fhis makes [it] a c hallenge to
manage them."
According to Block, the sec
ond challenge is "not knowing
enough about tuna populations
and their behaviors." Bloc k's lab
will be publishing a paper in Sci
ence that "will give a whole new
perspective to this issue."
In Naylot's view, "the main
problem is our continued depen
dence on the use offish."
"Habitat modification, intro
duction of non-indigenous or
ganisms, disruption of food web
interactions and disposal of

chemicals are other major con
i ei lis, Na\lor said. She outlined
these issues in a papei published
last |une in Nature.
Amidst the controversy, the
benefits of commercial fishing
cannot be ignored.
I n developing countries, espe
cially in Southeast Asia, in
creased food production has dra
matically reduced starvation. In
India, fish have been .1 crucial
addition to family nutrition. In
Africa, they are an important
source of income.
Kven developed countries —
where other sources ol food are
abundant — are heavily depen
dent on commercial fishing. In
deed, 90 percent of all harvested
fish ends up on the plate of Kuro
pcan, American or Japanese
households.
"Indeed, aquaculture is not in
herently bad," Kagle said. "In
fact, withstanding personal opin
ion, the market demands it and
[aquaculture] will happen. The

big question is how to do it right."
Sustainable Aquaculture
l lu- problem ot overfishing
has intensified since produc
tion has surged, particularly
during the past ten to fifteen
years. Farmed fish supplies to
taled 29 megatons in 1997,
compared with 10 megatons a
decade ago.
"The human population is
soaring beyond >i\ billion," Block
said. "In the case of tuna, it is un
clear it the fish (.m handle this
growing demand."
I lie trend is especially dan
gerous in China, which has the
largest human population and
aquaculture in the world.
For instance, about HO percent
of carp and 65 percent of tilapia
worldwide are farmed without
the use of modern compound
feeds — feeds formulated from
multiple ingredients. In China,

These fish look happy. But what are they really thinking? Do they care that they
smell like fish? Do they care that they are in the midst of a fashion disaster be
cause everybody is wearing the same thing?
larmed production of carp and othct omnivo
rous spe< us is intensifying and new commer
cial leeds mills art* being developed to serve
these industries.
One o! the solutions is farming down the

would require long-term practices such as
regulating ponds and mangroves, and a radi

ment banks are key agencies to help poorer
countries implement new methods.

loi Navlor, sin.ill-stale actions such as con
sumer awareness are important for change.
A< ( ording to Nayloi, "il public and private
interests act jointlv to reduce external costs

generated by limning systems, present trends
may be reversed and the net contribution of
aquai uliure to global fish supplies can become
increasingly positive."
I he alternative might he a future of life

A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,
but what these fish are in need of is some salt and a
nice embalming.
