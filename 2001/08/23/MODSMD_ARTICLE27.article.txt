# Canadians decide to make medicinal marijuana legal
## 
### VIC REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Our neighbors to the north
have legalized marijuana, but
only for medicinal purposes, so
don't pack your pipes in a hemp
satchel and head for the border
just yet. On July 30, the Canadian
government made it legal for the
chronically ill to grow and use
cannabis, providing a lxx>st to
those pushing for similar laws in
the United States.
(California's Proposition 215 al
lows physicians to recommend
marijuana to patients and allows
patients to cultivate and possess
the drug. Kight other states, most
ly in the West, have passed initia
tives like Proposition 215.

A May 14 ruling by the U.S.
Supreme Court put an end to the
Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Club
and all large-scale distributors,
but individual users in the nine
states with medical marijuana
laws are still safe from prosecu
tion. However, the recent tilling
does indicate that we are not like
ly to follow Canada's lead any
time soon.
Scott Lowe, a senior in man
agement science and engineer
ing involved in the marijuana
legalization movement, said,
"Our strategy now is to make
the proposition that has al
ready passed work, so it doesn't
look like a failure in the eyes of
the public."
According to doctors, marijua

na can help cancer patients un
dergoing chemotherapy and
people with AIDS by reducing
nausea and anxiety, relieving
pain and acting as an appetite
stimulant. It also has therapeutic
potential for those suffering from
asthma, multiple sclerosis and de
generative muscle and bone dis
eases. Although most advocatesof
medicinal marijuana argue that
smoking it is the Ix'st way to ab
sorb the drug, it is also prescribed
in capsules.
