mans witnessed a millennium ago. \i llic
centei ol tlie nebula is a dense object
known as a puls.u .
"It's basiialb like a nucleus, said l\< >gei
Romani, .111 associate professor ol pli\ sics
wbo devotes some of bis research eflorts to

pulsars. "But instead
of a regular atomic
number like one tor
hvtlrogen, a pulsai has
an atomic number ol
around 10' .
Pulsars are neutron

si;ii"s with strong magnetic fields. As the
name implies, pulsars I'm it wavelengths (»l
energy with predictable regularity—a
consequence ol rapid rotation, the fastest
of wliii h is estimated to lie about (>()() times
per second.
"Since changing magnetic fields pro
duce electric fields, the pulsars act like
panic le ac < eleratoi s." Rotnani said. "Neu
tron si.lis ac l ver\ much like SI AC., but
make SI A( look like .1 pop-gun.
Will) a radius of about 10 kin, it is dil
lic nil to direc tl\ observe? pulsars with tele
scopes. As a result, Roinani studies the
different wavelengths of light — 1 tinning
the whole gamut ol the electromagnetic
spectrum — that pulsars produce in
ore lei 10 inter information about these c e
leslial objects.
"A lot ol people in astrophysics concen
trate on one wavelength — maybe visible light
or X-rays," Romani said. "I like pulsars hc
c ause I get to study light of all wavelengths."
Roinani recently collec ted data on the
radio waves produced In pulsars using a
huge ground telescope in the Australian
outback. Romani has also been working
on plans for machinery that can detect vis
ible light and, in .1 few weeks, will have fin
ished developing a space telescope that
analyzes UV radiation.
In studying the part of the electromag
netic spectrum with the most energy —
gamma rays — Romani will be able to do

his work right at home.
"I lere at Stanford, there's the ('.anuria
Ray Large Area Spate Telescope
((.LAS I), which will make one ol its pri
nt.it \ targets these spin powered pul
sars," Romani said. "It's going to he
I,unit lied in 200(j."
Bet a use pulsars at is like particle accel
erators on steroids, Romani hopes to use
them to deduce new theories in physics
that si ientisis cannot vet test.
"()neexample is that we don I know the
equation ol state of matter at really high
densities," Romani said.
When stntlving phenomena such as
pulsars, phvsicists use computers to build
models. When the observed data tit) not lii
the model, phvsicists must improve the
theon upon which the model is based.
"When the models and the observa
tions match, vou can pat voursell on the
back, but vou haven't made that much
progress," Romani said. "But when the\
don't match and vou have to improve your
model, it's then that there's an advance (in
the scieut e]."
Although some physitists are either
theorists 01 experimentalists, Romani
considers hinisell straddling boili cate
gories. I lealsoenjovs the work because he
enjovs working in small groups ol up to
live people.
"Sou gel to go oil in small teams and
use amazing machines that were pro
duced at very high costs fora lew
nights," Romani said. "And vou get to
write up the paper and be involved in
the whole thing."
While an undergraduate at Princeton,
Romani was a pre-med majoring in
physics. After lie did a senior thesis on pul
sar physics — under a professor who
would later win a Nobel Prize — Romani
decided to study physics in graduate
school instead of pursuing a medical de
gree. Not surprisingly, Roinani's awe with
pulsars continues to ibis day.
"In a very real sense these are the most
exotic objects observable in the universe,"
Romani said.
