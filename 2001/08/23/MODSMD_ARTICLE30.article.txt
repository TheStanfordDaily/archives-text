Weeks Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Alabama. A ghost crab outside of its bur
row. Ghost crabs live in burrows along the sandy beaches of the Eastern United States. The
crabs can reach relatively large sizes of over 50 mm in shell width. They are omnivorous
and will eat other crabs, clams, insects, vegetation and detritus. Feeding activity takes place
at night, whereas burrowing occurs during the day. Burrows show zonation with young
crabs found closer to shore, near water. Older crabs tend to burrow farther from water. The
large eyes of the crab are sensitive to changes in light intensity. The crab can produce three
sounds: a rapping of the claw on the substrate, a rasping stridulation of the legs and a bub
bling sound presumably produced from the gill chamber. Combat between males is highly
ritualized and rarely ends with contact.
