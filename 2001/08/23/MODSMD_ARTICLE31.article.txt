# Get ready for Seiko Instruments' smart new pad

N F.W Y( )RK (AP) - I 'm Mill someone who
likes to lake notes on paper, so the idea ol
using an electronic organizer while Mill writ
ing on a regular notepad was something 1
dinned worth trying.
SmartPad2 Ironi Seiko Instruments I SA
I iK is a nifty device that transfers handwrit
ten notes into major personal digital assis
tants. I hat means 1 could write to my heart's
content on a notepad, and within seconds
my words, doodles or whatever else would
he stored in in\ handheld device.
Kut I quicklv found th.it the benefits ol
using Smart Pad 2 were limited. I liked it lot
jotting (low n simple graphs or drawings, as
well as taking quick notes and keeping them
organized. I lowever, ii can be cumbersome
for other tasks.
I he Smart Pad 2 is an update to the origi
nal Smart Pad that caineout last year. Selling
lor about $200, Smart Pad 2 is compatible
with most I'D As on the market, including
those from Palm, Sony, IBM and Hand
spring, that run the Palm operating system.
I he contraption is stored in a large zip
pered case, about 7-by-1C) inches. While

there is room in it fora i ell phone and pos
sibly ,i few other small items, I found the
case bulkv. It would not even lit in nn
poi ketbook.
Open the case, and along the left side
there's a slot fot the electronic organizer,
.i dual-sided pen-stvlus and an infrared
port that can be adjusted depending on
w hi( h PDA you use. C )u the i ight side is a
5-by-8-iii( h pad that sits atop a digital
sheet .uul a keypad.
Smart Pad 2 itsell w eights 1.5 pounds,
though it feels .i lot hea\ ier.
I o start. \ou must download to the PDA
software lor transferring documents be
tween the notepad and the ele< troni( orga
nizer. I hen, the PDA inusi be slid into its
spot in the case and properh aligned with
the infrared port.
I urn on the electrons organizer, and
open one of its lour basic programs - date
book, address book, to-do list and memo
pad. Once you start writing, the words or
drawings immediately appear on the
PDA's screen.
l he Smart Pad 2 does not use any special

language, such as Palm's graffiti handwrit
ing language, or shorn uts that are genet al
ly commonplace when operating eleiironic
organizers. I he words you jot down and the
penmanship \ou use appear on the screen,
so neatness does pa\ oil.
I here is a zoom feature to enlarge what
is on the s< recti. I bis is a big help because
the writing on the screen iuitialh looks so
small, it is almost impossible to read.
I he data colle( ted in the PD \ from the
Smart Pad 2 are not transfer!ed into text but
sta\ in handwritten format (-11 images
files. Ip to If) pages ol notes (an be saved in
the same file, each page t.iking up 2k ol
ineinorv in the PI)A.
SinartPad2 files are stored as attach
ments. l or instance, when you w rite an ad
dress on the notepad, you can save it under
the person's name in the PDA. When you
later look loi that name, you i lie k on the at
tac Imient to find the handwritten address.
Using the included software, you can
transfer the attachment from your PDA to a
computer, from where vou can print, fax or
e-mail the.(A 112 files.

An additional capability of the Sinart
l'ad'2 is ilif keypad that sits below the
notepad. Ii is nearl\ 250 pen ent larger than
the I DA's tin\ keypad. While the Smart-
Pace's keypad is easier to work with, in
some t .ist-s it re(|tiires taking a lew extra
steps when entet ing data.
I lomid that the Smartl'ad2 was great to
use for entering graphical information. It's
perfect l<>i driving directions - with draw
ings to explain some tw Ms and turns.
I also liked using the dc\ ice when I want
ed to write down a lew t|tiirk notes, such as a
grcK'ery shopping list.
But I could not see the benefit of using
the Smartl\id2 all the time.
I did not like tli.it in\ notes were not
translerred into text - and could only be
\iewed as ,111 attac hinent. It (ieatesacluins\
procedure when storing information in the
address or date book.
Ihe Sm.ti t Pac 12. w hie hi uris on two AAA
battel ies, is i urrently sold .it (ionipl SA and
on the Seiko Web site. Stat ting this fall, it is
expected to be available at most major oflice
supply c hains.
