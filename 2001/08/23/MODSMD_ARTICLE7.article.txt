## Barn hosts festival 
### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford's past .is a horse (arm was cel
ebrated at Saturday's Red Barn Festival.
Community members sampled "a dav
on the Farm," with carriage rides, a pet
ting zoo, exhibitions, pony rides and ven
dors highlighting the 1 lit 11 annual festival.
"The purpose [of the festival] is
twofold," said Cynthia Brownlee, the barn
manager and member ol the Red Barn
Festival 2001 Committee.
"First, it allows the public to become
part of the barn, bring their kids and ex
perience horses,' she said. "Second, it al
lows lor capital improvements. I he\ say
the wa\ to make a small fortune in horses
is to begin with a large fortune. I he Red
Barn is a historical landmark, and it's not
cheap to keep it in good shape. We
couldn't afford to do necessary upgrades
without the festival.
I lie needed improvements include in
stalling lights in the covered arena, redo
ing the base and footing to create a
smoother ground and building a new
round arena, according to Brownlee.
In addition, the proceeds fund a rid
ing program for the Fast Palo Alto
YMCA.
I he Red Barn was built in 1870 as part
of Governor I.eland Stanford's original
Palo Alto Stock Farm.
"In some ways, the barn predates the
University," Brownlee said.
"At one point, all the horses had to be
sold to keep the University going. It's an
integral part of the University's history,
filings that people don't appreciate tend
to disappear and we'd like to have the barn
around fora long time."
Attendance was greater than expected,

Brownlee said.
l).t\ id Woodbury, a Palo Alio resident,
attended the festival with his family. "We
wanted to expose the children to horses
with a pony ride," he said. "It's very in
teresting. I'd always heard ol the histori
cal aspect of the barn and this is the first
time I've been here. I 'he kids loved the
petting /oo.'
('.at ol (lee ol I .os Altos brought her two
children to the festival because "|her]
daughtei loves horses. She had fun play
ing in the dirt and hay bales."
Members ol the Stanford Equestrian
I'earn helped the Stanford Equestrian
('.enter host the Red Barn Festival.
Senior Cindy Lin, a member of the
team, said the festival was "good for the
team to put our name out in the commu
nity â€” not many people know that Stan
ford has an equestrian team for students."
|unior Ana Lombera, president of the
team, said the festival was"a family-orient
ed gathering for people interested in the
barn and an opportunity to showcase the
talent here. 1 lie festival allows people who
don't know much about horses to gain ex
posure."
Exhibitions at the festival included
polo, dressage, carriage driving, jumping
and vaulting, the sport of gymnastics on
horseback.
Bill andean Lane co-chaired the
festival's honorary committee. Bill
Lane, Jr. is a former United States am
bassador to Australia, Nauru and
Japan, and a retired publisher of Sunset
magazine. His fundraising efforts a
decade ago helped refurbish the Red
Barn. I lis family also donated the statue

to the Red Barn.
