members as part of their tour.
Though the committee members made no overt
evaluation of the success of their scrutiny of Stanford
and the Bav Area's venues and location, BobCondron,
USOC. director of media services, said he was im
pressed by the sites.
" The venues are incredible," Condron said in the
Palo Alto Daily News.
"This is like an ()lympic set-up," he said in the Stan
ford Report.
The USCXI delegation, in the midst of its tour of all

United States bids, was in the Bay Area for four days
before moving on to its eighth and last stop in I xÂ»s An
geles. The committee is expected to narrow down its
poolof bid cities from eight to four after the completion
of the tour.
Some criteria under consideration, in addition to
the quality and attainability of sports infrastructure, in
(hide the need for construction of an athletes' village,
the availability of accomodations for visitors and
tourists, the possibilities for general transmu tation and
the support of the government and public opinion.
I hese selection guidelines were designed by the Inter
national Olympic Committee, which, like the USOC,
will eventually grade all the bid cities.
According to the US(XI Web site, each city is re
sponsible for developing and executing a strategy to
successfully host the Olympics for two weeks.

biddding cities around the world. By September 2005,
the I( X . will have chosen a city for its 2012 Olympics.
