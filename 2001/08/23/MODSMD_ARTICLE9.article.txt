Ilit' Stanford Medical
School Blood ('-enter has re
cently fated a shortage in the
blood supply usually collected
from area blood drives.
I he mobile blood drives,
which provide the Blood Ou
ter with about fifty percent of its
blood supply, are typically run
privately by local companies
and are designed to draw from
the available pool of employees
of these companies. This
month, the Center is expecting
to collect approximately thirty
percent of its total supply from
mobile drives, according to
Doreen Leith, the Center's su
pervisor of mobile recruitment.

"We have seen oftentimes
that companies haven't seen
i lie same kinds of numbers with
lower employee turnout," said
Michele C.assaway, community
and media relations coordina
tor for the ('.enter. "Companies
are cutting outside activities
with their employees because
they are downsizing."
According to Leith, six chi
ves were canceled in August.
Though the Blood Center was
able to find organizations at the
last minute to sponsor smaller
drives as a replacement for a
few of the canceled ones,
nowhere near the usual quota
of blood was obtained.
"We've had occasional can
cellations, but we never saw it as
.1 huge I rend before," Leith s.iid.
I hough blood collection dur
ing die summer is typicall) more
difllcult, since manv potential
donors are on vacation, the fear is
that the recent economic slump
in Silicon Valley will mean that
less blood will be donated on a
regular basis.
"[Once the summer is over],
we'll have the donors at our cen
ters who are on vacation back,
.ind that should improve the situ
ation," Leith said.
Leith said that she is opti
mistic that the situation will im
prove at the end of the summer,
though she said she is unsure il it
will be able to reach its previous
numbers.
The Blood Center, which
serves the Stanford Hospital, Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital,
El (".amino Hospital, O'Connor
Hospital and the I'alo Alto Med
ical Foundation, has been im
porting blood to forestall having
their shortage in local collections
impact the hospitals.
"So far, we've been able to sup
ply the hospitals," Cassaway said.

I n addition to the seasonal and
economic-based blood deficien
cy, Cassaway said that the Center
also is dealing with tighter con
straints on blood collection.
"We always need people to
come in," Cassawa\ s.iid. "Right
now, it's really difficult because
we're facing stricter regulations
on [donors who have| traveled to
Europe."
According to Leith, accidents
on holidays traditionally cause
there to be a larger need for do
nated blood. As a result, in
preparation for the Labor Day
holiday, the Center is gearing up
to motivate potential donors.
file ( enter has two locations,
one in PaloAltoand one in Moun
tain View. Students and members
of the community are invited to
come to either center to donate
blood. A donor must weigh at least
110 pounds, be between seven
teen and seventy-four years of
age, have never had hepatitis, be
in good health and have a valid
photo identification. To make .in
appointment to donate at either
center, call (650) 723-7831 or visit

more information.
"It's an ongoing battle to keep
donors coming in on a repeat
basis," Cassaway said.
