the program.
"I greatly value the continued
existence ol the SIS degree pro
gram at Stanford. In our increas
ingl\ complex world, I feel that it is
essential that Stanford maintains a
commitment to produce students
w ho have the perspectives that de
gree-holders in SIS possess," lie

nesch wrote. "It is critical that stu
dents have the means to devote
their academic careers to the study
of STS. Only then will Stanford be
producing more graduates who
not only understand the concepts
of STS, but who can also help teach
these concepts to others in the out
side world."
