## FAREWELL FROM THE EDITOR Editor finds Weekly to be more than sum of its parts 
### SCOTT DORFMAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
When 1 began my ten-week tenure .is ed
itor in chief of I lie Stanford Weekly in late
June, I knew little about what to ex pet t in Ihe
ensuing summer months. In all honesty, 1
knew very little about how to produce a col
legiate newspaper, manage a stall, or do
much of anything in my job description.
While my time at 1 lie Weekly allowed me
pick up such skills, or at least make a fake at
them, my weeks spent as editor also afford
ed me the ability to look at the whole ol'the
newspaper, a whole that includes two very
important halves. And for the past ten weeks,
I have been amazed by what I have seen.
For those of you who have not been in
the Daily of lice building, a relatively equal
amount of space exists for "edit-side,"
where the writers and editors do their
thing, and "ad-side," where the business,
advertising and circulation decisions are
made. As a news editor for the Daily, I
often walked into ad-side to make copies or
pick up a fax and thought, "Damn, if 1 had
this job I'd shoot myself ." Making cold calls
and trying to sell things come as naturally
to me as free throws do to Shaq, so I al
ready had an inherent respect for those
who performed these tasks for The Daily.
What I did not realize was the amount of
work and long hours put in by these indi
viduals. who work all day, every day, creat
ing each .id to an advertiser's exact specifi
cations and often dealing with angry or un
pleasant callers.
I he hard work and of ten thankless ded
ication of those on ad side — Wes, Mark,
Stephanie, Marketa, Miguel, I'eigi,
Michelle and Diane — have allowed us on
edit side to spend time and energy think
ing about what movies to review, what sci
entific innovations to cover and what kind
of pizza to order. While their names ap
pear few times in The Weekly, their impact
on the paper can be seen on every page.
Both advertisers and Weekly staff mem
bers are privledged to work with such a tal
ented group of individuals.
As far as the other side of The Weekly,
edit side, goes, my position as Eld has af
forded me the opportunity to see extraor
dinary students come together once a week

to make an extraordinary product. Before
our first issue, 1 had grand delusions of sip
ping pina coladas in my office all day and
playing afternoon rounds at The Stanford
Golf Course, blessed as I was with a staff that
included a former Weekly EIC, a former
Daily EIC and the best sports columnist in
recent Stanford history.
1 soon found that producing a paper —
daily or weekly — involved far more work
and effort than 1 had envisioned, and my
salted Margarita glass (juiikly became a
coffee mug for our 2 a.m. edit nights. How

ever, the stall more than lived up to my
great expectations, and each section re
flected the humor, knowledge and talent of
its respective editor or editors. Nadira's
photos, Ere/.'s graphics, Ulrike's layout,
Imuran's typesetting and Marisa, Sandra,
Coops, Amanda, Jeff, Sarah, Kimmy and
Jeremy's sections were all top-notch, as are
each ol the individuals themselves. And the
gossip about hook-ups, breakups, and
screwups from a few on that list kept the of
fice rife with scandal throughout the some
times boring summer months.

I began this summer's Stanford Weekly
with a column urging students to stop and
reflect upon why they are here and where
they are going. Well, after ten weeks 1 have
no idea where I am going but I know exact
ly why I am here, still sitting in the Editor's
chair. It is because I have been surrounded
by a group of people — those working in
both halves of The Weekly's whole — that
have made my summer job rewarding, in
teresting and fun. I hope that each of your
summer's has been as well, and that you
have made The Weekly a part of it.
