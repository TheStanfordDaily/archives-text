# Maryland college changes its name

### 
BALTIMORE (AIM — I lie
city's most prestigious art school
has dec ided to drop a comma 112 rom
its name, punctuating the end <>l .1
yearlong debate involving locus
groups, committees and .1 hired
consultant.
Students returned to school
Monda\ at the Maryland Insti
tute College of Art. formerly
known as the Maryland Institute,
College of Art.
"We decided after .ill these
vears we could have an integrated
whole," MICA President Fred
Lazarus said. "We don't need the
line in the middle anvmore."
Supporters of the new name
said each half represented a part of
the school's past — its beginning as
an institute that instructed artisans
in practical applications of their
trade and its development as a fine
arts college in the 19f>0s, when the
school began awarding degrees.
"VVe just want them both, 'insti
tute' and 'college,'" said Doug
Frost, the school's vice president
for development. "We found out
that people are really attached to
both of the words."
Name changes are not new in
the annals of higher education.
In 1997, Maryland's I owson
State University paid $200,000 to
a New York firm to oversee its
plans to drop the word "state"
from its name.

Salisbury State I niversitv
dropped "state"from its name
earlier this year, ending jokes
about the name's similarity to Sal
isbury steak.
University System of Mary
land Chancellor Donald N. Lan
genberg took the opposite
route, adding commas at the
University of Maryland, College
Park and the University of
Mary land, Baltimore.
"You want public recogni
tion." Langenberg said. "Acade
mics are terribly vain, and pres
tige and status mean everything
to them."
File Maryland Institute Col
lege of Art changed its name .is
part of a full-scale sell-exaniina
tion for the school's 175 th an
niversary. I he official announce
ment was made last yveek, but
school officials say they've been
phasing in the name change grad
ually for the past six months.
Student reaction has been
mixed.
I"he comma provided a needed
pause, said junior ('arrie Warseck.
"It's kind of long to say with one
breath." Warseck said.
Freshman Ken Nock said hav
ing two similar words, 'college'
and 'institute,' next to each other is
odd. " There's no such thing as an
institute college," Nock said. "It
doesn't make am sense."
