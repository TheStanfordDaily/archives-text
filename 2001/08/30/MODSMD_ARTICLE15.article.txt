against tin- Ferrapins 1 uesdav
at the Varsity Turf Field.
lint based on the teams'
emotions after the game, the
final score may not have told
who i eall) came out ahead.
I lu- ( ardinal players played
the role of the winners better
than the victorious lei ps after
Stanford (0-2) held No. 2
Maryland (!?-()) scoreless
through 17 minutes of play and
gave the tluee-time defending
Atlantic ('.oast Conference
champions more of a match
than expected.
It felt great out there be
cause we put our heart and

soul into this match," said se
nior co-captain Erica Swesey.
"Last year we went down 8-1 to
them and that was hallwax
through ilu- season, so this is
exciting to see at the start ol
this year."
Despite their somewhat dis
appointed expressions follow
ing the match, the Tcrps did
dominate the game, as Mary

trip to the West Coast unde
feated, after posting 8-0 wins
over Pacific and California this
weekend at Stanford.
Maryland senior forward
Dina Rl//0 scored the winning
goal, lifting a rebound oil a cor
ner shot over Cardinal goal
keeper Rebecca Shapiro to put
Maryland on the board with
22:4 I remaining.
I lie stalwart Maryland midfield kept
the ball in the Cardinal's half of the Held
lor much ol the game, and the Ferps bar
raged the Stanford net, ontshooting the
Card 27-2.
But despite the Hurry of shots, Mary
land didn't force many quality scoring op
portunities, as the grim (Cardinal defense
gave the ferps' forwards little room to
work in the Stanford circle.
for most of the match, the Stanford de
fenders were solid around the goal, gi\ ing
up few second chances off goaltender
Shapiro's 18 saves, and the Cardinal
avoided turnovers deep in its own end.
"Our defense was a real wall," said se
nior defender Melita Sawyer, who re
turned to the Cardinal this year after
missing the past season with an eye injury.
"They couldn't get their shots through,
and we frustrated them deep in our end."
Crisp passing and quick ball movement
allowed Maryland to control possession
for much of the first half, but the ferps'
technical skills could not overpower the
Cardinal's aggressive defensive play, and
the teams finished the half scoreless.
"We had our aggression up and kept
them down fora while,"' Swese\ said. "We
had a lot of double teams, we were tack

ling and we picked up a yellow card."
1 hat aggressiveness ma\ have gotten
the better of the Card in the second half,
as a stronger offensive push by Maryland
drew 10 penalty corners out of Stanford,
which led to all three of the ferps' goals.
With 11:20 to play, Clarissa Messimer
redirected a shot bv Ri//o off a penalt\
corner to freshman Luc\ Morris, who
tipped it in to put Maryland up 2-0.
Sat a Silvetti closed out the scoring with
8:31 left, fiting a scorching shot off a
penalt\ corner that deflected of 112 Shapiro's
j).ids into the top of the goal.

rebound shot over a sprawling Shapiro

"It was frustrating because we dominat
ed them, espet ialh in the first half," Sawver
said. "We just couldn't get it in the back of
the goal, .ltul they got a kooky goal."
After ontshooting Delaware 5-2 in the
first half, the Cardinal struggled to clear
its end in the second half, with sloppy

lor much ol the game, and the Ferps bar
raged the Stanford net, ontshooting the
Card 27-2.
But despite the Hurry of shots, Mary
land didn't force many quality scoring op
portunities, as the grim (Cardinal defense
gave the ferps' forwards little room to
work in the Stanford circle.
for most of the match, the Stanford de
fenders were solid around the goal, gi\ ing
up few second chances off goaltender
Shapiro's 18 saves, and the Cardinal
avoided turnovers deep in its own end.
"Our defense was a real wall," said se
nior defender Melita Sawyer, who re
turned to the Cardinal this year after
missing the past season with an eye injury.
"They couldn't get their shots through,
and we frustrated them deep in our end."
Crisp passing and quick ball movement
allowed Maryland to control possession
for much of the first half, but the ferps'
technical skills could not overpower the
Cardinal's aggressive defensive play, and
the teams finished the half scoreless.
"We had our aggression up and kept
them down fora while,"' Swese\ said. "We
had a lot of double teams, we were tack

ling and we picked up a yellow card."
1 hat aggressiveness ma\ have gotten
the better of the Card in the second half,
as a stronger offensive push by Maryland
drew 10 penalty corners out of Stanford,
which led to all three of the ferps' goals.
