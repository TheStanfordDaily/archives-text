### RAMIN SETOODEH STAFF WRITER 
"The Curse ol the Jade Scorpi
on" is .1 s( revvball comed\ with si\ k
and spirit — two things most come
dies lack these days. Wood) Allen,
as writer, director and star, brings
together another unlikeh (.ist ol
characters and blends them togeth
er in a sweet, hut not saccharine, set
ting. I he movie doesn't nec essarily
have the perfect comcdic timing 01
the golden touch, but it's well-w 1 it
ten and well-acted and the audience
can slip right into the stor\ line like .1
paii of old comibrtable slippers.
Allen stais as CA\ Briggs, .1 top
notch insurance investigatoi who
flirts three blond bombshells, each
voting enough to be bis daughtei
(or granddaughter, depending 011
how good you are .11 math). I le eves
bis sexy secretarv (F.li/abeth

Berklev ol "Saved by the Bell"
lame), has .1 romantic rendezvous
with a imsterious client (Charli/e
l lieron), and tries to win the affec
tions of new efficiency expert, Bettv
Ann Kit/gerald (Helen Hunt).
llie plot might sound like a
melodramatic soap opera — be
cause that's what the movie is. But
the ke\ is that Allen sets the story in
the 1940s with lush scenarios and
grand, old-fashioned costumes. II
Bogart was Mill making movies, ihev
would iertainly look like this.
As lor the stor\ line, both Berkley
and I heron are swept aside In
Hunt's character, who resists (AV
Briggs's advances. Whv? Does she
iliink he's too old for her? Not teal
l\ She's in love with the head hon
cho 111 the insurance department
(Dan \vkroyd), but he's a slimy
s( umball who won't leave his wire
like he promised.
I have spent a great deal of time
discussing the plot and — alas —
have not even mentioned the key
scene. Bett\ and (AV are both hvp
noti/ed at «i night club act by the
great Yoltan (David Odgen Stiers)
and think they are in love 011-stage.
They snap out of it, of course, but it
seems that Yoltan is also .1 diabolical

jewel thief, and he later phones
both Betty and CW at home, gives
them the hypnotic word and has
them steal valuables for him.
It's absurd. It's ridiculous. It's
completely unbelievable. Hut it's
also likable, and the movie skips
along, hitting the right chords all
the way through.
I lelen Hunt is excellent through
out the film. She has been verv good
before, in better movies like "As
Good As it («ets." And she's been
ver\ good before, in worse movies
like the horrendous "Dr. I & the
Woman." In"The Curse of the Jade
Scorpion," she plavs a similar char
acter to her advertising executive
hotshot in "What Women Want.
Allen, like always, is brilliant in all
his various roles, and uses his sharp
wit and sarcastic humor to produce
yet another smart comedv
The few faults I could find were
with the machinery of the plot and
the haphazard ending. In main
places throughout, the slows
and the ending is shameless and
contrived. But overall, 1 liked the
film. It is a comedy that makes no
apologies. It is what it is: a harmless
caper that's zany and warm and
lights up the screen.
