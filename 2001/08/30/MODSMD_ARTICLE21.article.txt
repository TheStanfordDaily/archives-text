Rife with racial stereotypes
and predictable plot twists, Walt
Disney's "Bubble Boy" should
onl\ attract viewers whose sensi
bilities are immune to bad film.
Directed by Blair Hayes,
"Bubble Bo\" stars |ake Gvllen
haal as Jimmy Livingston, a Cali
fornia n teenager w ho is "allergic
to everything" and must live in a
hermetic all\ sealed, sterile room.
His mother (Swoosie Kurtz)
brings him home from the hospi
tal at the age ol four and becomes
the sole nurse, teacher, and play
mate in his life.

Never having ventured into
the outside world and sheltered
from the media, Jimmy first
glimpses temptation through his
window with the appearance ola
beautiful blonde provocativeh
washing her car. I'he fenune la
tale turns out to be his new neigh
bor, (lliloe (Marley Shelton). 1 he
teenage crush develops and be
comes mutual as Chloe begins
spending time beside Jimnn s
bubble and becomes his first
friend.
However, heartbreak is in
evitable as the lovers are literalh
separated forever by a wall ol
plastic. After stubborn Jimmy re
fuses to profess his true feelings
for her or allow her into the bub
ble. Chloe runs away to marry
her high school sweetheart, Mark
(Kid Rock). The odyssey begins
when Jimmy engineers a plastic
suit that allows him to leave his
house and travel to Niagara Falls
to stop the wedding. His adven

inn sand misadventures along
the wa\ introduce him to a wide
variet\ of people and show him
the true value ol li iendship.
Disney spites up "Bubble
Bov's" i lie he premise and weak
lead acting bv the s( ript's outra
geous renderings ol the Liv
ingston family and the acquain
tances | immy meets on lus join -
nev. As he llees his parents on
the wav to Niagara, Jimmy
meets an ice-cream truck dri
ver, a gang of hell's angels and a
host for mud-wrestling matt li
es. What defines each of these
encounters is racial identity.
His other acquaintances, a cult
and.i freak show, presumably
have other characteristics that
make them laughable and
ridiculous.
A scathing caricature ol con
servative small-town (christians,
the Livingstons are at one mo
ment the pathetic butt of a joke
and at another the evil enemy
in "Bubble Boy." An oversized
portrait of Ronald Reagan
hanging on the wall of the Liv
ingston home and Mrs. Liv
ingston's cross-shaped cookies
with "INRI" icing providelhe
first laughs in "Bubble Boy. An
over-protective Mrs. Livingston
smilingly demands of her son,
"You'll always stay pure,
won'tcha, Jimmy?," after teach
ing him to say the pledge of al
legiance repeatedly as a cure for
the wickedness of an erection.
When he enters a small-tow n
diner, Jimmy is confronted by a
mob of whites with country

drawls gawking at a lone Indian
man, Pushba, eating toln and
wearing a turban. When Pusb
ba aa identallv runs over a cow
with his vehicle (which, of
course, is covered with Hindi
writing and topped with a stat
ue of Shiva) he is reduced to
tears and performs a religious
ceremony for the animal, the
tone ol which is reminiscent of
black-face comedy.
"1 lave you ever been karmi
callv bitch-slapped by a six
armed goddess?," the ice-cream
truck driver says in the halting
Indian accent made popular as
a source of derision by such
shows as " The Simpsons."
Another bi/arre episode aris
es when Jimmy enters a mud
wrestling competition in a bar
that is peopled solely by Asians.
Nodding vigorously, the host
calls |immy "Mistah Alien" and
repeatediv offers him "Fi

lunula dolla" for winning the
competition.
With so much objectionable
material, "Bubble Boy" certain
ly deserves the poor reviews
and attendance it has received.
Although Jimmy's disease is
never directly named as severe
combined immunodeficiency,
representatives of the Immune
Deficiency Foundation have
staged a letter writing and
media campaign in an effort to
censure what they believe to be
a mockery of this serious illness.
The intended message seems
to be, as Jimmy himself puts it,
"what's wrong with being a
freak?" Yet instead of demon
strating a shared humanity
among diverse people, "Bubble
Boy" points and laughs at their
differences. It is not surprising
that the IDI has boycotted the
film, and hopefully they will not
be the only ones to do so.
