('.ebel, the cot ksure animal train
ei whose greatest task seemed to
be coaxing the tigers from their
lethargy.
But the real star of the show
was Bello Nock, the shock-head

ed offspring from a seventh-gen
eration clown family. With a tal
ent for both loveable goofiness
and poised daredevilry, Bello un
dermined the notion of clowning
as mere slapstick diversion.
11l rough it all. his wall of red hair
remained unflappable, even
when slipping headfirst down a
100-loot high lamppost at break
neck speed.
Aftei Bello, the talent de

have employed hall the Olympic
ski jumping team fora routine
that is most striking in its indoor
setting, sans snow. I he trape/e
acrobats — called the "Angels of
l ire" — were troubled by a num
ber of falls, but they redeemed
themselves with a grateful rou
tine tailed "Cloud lumping."
The acrobats were launched
from ,1 swing, and tumbled
through the air until they collid
ed with a vertical white sheet.
1 love circuses for the chaos,

I lit* zaniness, t lit* sheer vaudevil
lean spirit of it; 1 don't think too
ninth ahont the political cor
rectness ol the event. So when
prior to the show, outside the
arena, an animal-rights activist
handed me a leaflet detailing
the abuses perpetrated against
llamas, I was a bit nonplussed.
Inside, next t<» the cotton-candv
counter, I discovered the
counter-propaganda: a pam
phlet with glossy pictures of
basking, content animals.
What's the truth? 1 don't
know, and I'm not sure il 1 care
enough to worry about it. And
the circus doesn't seem to be wor
ried, either — the marriage of
comedy and spectacle with ani
mal n i( ks is a time-tested recipe
for laughter and astonishment.
Why mess with that union? As
Iverson sings in the catchiest ol
the numbers: "Bo and Hello.
Hello and Ho; the greatest team
the circus has ever known!"
