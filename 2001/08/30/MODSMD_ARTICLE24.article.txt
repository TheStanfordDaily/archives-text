# It doesn't have Bubbles, but this 3-D show is a thriller

When I was eight vearsold, my
parents took me see "Captain Ho"
,ii Walt Disney World in Florida.
I lie mmie, starring \li< hae! Jack
son and shot entirely in 3-1), en
thralled me with its engaging
ston, superb acting, and, most of
all. its incredible three-dimension
al ellects. I he King of Pop seemed
to ama/ingly reach out and grab
me from within the screen when 1
had those goggles on. While 1 was
sad io find out years later that I was
not the first sin.ill boy Jackson had
rea< lied out and grabbed in his
lifetime, I was hooked — 3-1) was
had(as in awesome), like the star of
the movie himself.
Thirteen years have passed
since 1 saw Captain Ho, and m\
wonder at 3-1) has not ceased.
Iluis. it was with much anticipa
tion that I < het ked out"( irque du
Soleil: |ourney of Man 3-D" at the
l\l \\ I heater within San Francis
co's Sony Metreon. While not
nearly as captivating or as interest

ing as its Disne\ World predeces
sor, the latest I MAX 3-D oflering
did not disappoint.
"journey of Man is not so
nuu ha movie as it isa showcase for
random acts bv Freiu h circus per
formers. Fven by I MAX standards,
the film is seriously lacking in the
storyline department. 'I"he movie
follows the"I niversal Child," a
British gentleman who goes from
infant to elder in less than 45 min
utes, showing the child and, later,
man's discoveries at each stage of
his life. At every stage, the I tiiver
sal Child is followed by a pair of
clowns who speak a language
sounding verv much like a combi
nation French and Ewok.
l he discoveries, siu Ii as love,
courage and wonder, are each il
lustrated through four or five
minute performances In Cirque
du Soleil acrobats, who sponta
neously appear before the I ni
versal C 'liild in random, exotic lo
cations. For example, the young
child learns about wonder after
wandering through a tropical
forest and seeing upside-down
bungee-trape/e artists. Love is
illustrated by two statues who
come to life on a lily-pad and
perform contorsion acts on each
other. Following his revelation
about love, the Universal Child
makes a pact with the devil be
lieving that money and power
are the keys to life. I he rest of
the movie was no more intelligi

bit*, and continually It'll nu
scratching in\ ;i-l) goggled head
to figure out what was going on.
Fortunately, the ridiculous
storyline did not spoil the stunts
or effects in the movie, which
make up the vast majoritx of the
film's 50 minutes. Never having
before seen Cirque du Soleil, 1
was very impressed by the
troupe's on-screen acrobatics, in
cluding one performer's incredi
ble double backllip onto the
shoulders ol another — who just
happened to be standing on the
shoulders ol another. For some
one like myself, who is easily ini
pressed b\ acrobatics like kirsten
l)unst's stunts in "Bring u On" or
Denise Richards' contortions in
"Wild filings." the Cirque du
Soleil performances were noth
ing short ol unbelievable.
While I left the Metreon satis
lied In the death-delving stunts
,ind *M)elfe< is in )ourne\ of Man,
1 remain pu//.led win an\ story
line was necessary at all I mean,
"IMAX F.xtrcme Sports" did not
follow the journey of the I niversal
Skatepunk from childhood to old
age, and I MAX's "Africa: Ele
phant Kingdom" did not ne**d to
intertwine a Dutnbo-esque story
to earn rave reviews. Had film
makers cut away the l()-minutes
or so of Universal Child window
dressing, a few additional stunts
could have been added and the
audience could have been spared

the indignity of hearing such
banal cliches as, "Above dreams
and wonder there remains love,
glorious love." Please.
Nevertheless, Cirque du Soleil
conies highly recommended

should you be interested in a trip
to the really big screen be in the
near future. While the movie is
storytelling at its worst, it is un
doubtedlv 3-D and I MAX at its un
rivalled best.
