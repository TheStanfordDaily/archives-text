# You’re 'All Over the Guy’, get a room
## 
### RANDY MANO STAFF WRITER 
I'm sure we have all had the
experience of being set up on a
blind date. There's even a reality
based show on that very subject.
It's part of our psyche to want to
get to know someone else without
knowing anything going in.
That said, almost anyone can
relate to the predicament in "All
Over the Guy." There are four
players involved, three of them
male, and the object of the game
i> to make two couples out of
them.

-As in any romantic comedy,
the four will periodically be "sent
to jail," but those "get out of jail
free" cards are aplenty. Brett
(Adam Goldberg) and Jackie
(Sasha Alexander) can hear their
internal clocks ticking, so when
they meet at the furniture store
Brett works at, they instantly fall
in love.
More substantial but still
maddeningly ridiculous at
times, Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) —
Brett's long-time friend — is set
up with loin (Richard Ruccolo),
Jackie's hot-cold amigo. I he two
initially have trouble even con
versing about movies, the safest
of all topics, but soon their eyes
lock and the magic between
them is palpable.
In general, 1 have some trou
ble with the romantic-comedy
genre, given that certain hack
neyed devices and lines must be
used in the name of love. For the
two gentlemen, they see signs —

whether a t-shirt, cable movie, or
some other highly visible and
quasi-out-of-place object — that
make them think of each other.
For Brett and Jackie, it's about
sexual connection rather than
personality or background simi
larities.
Directed by Julie Davis, "All
Over the Guy" is witty at times
nad melodramatic at others. \<>u
can expect some good one-liners
and a couple of great cameos In
Christina Ruii as a nuslii sister
and Lisa Kudrow as an ollbeat
radio voice.
In all, it's a fairly predictable
outing that, iu my opinion, cops
out in the end (.is fcli's psycholo
gist parents would say). But the
film brings up some interesting
observations about life and rela
tionships that might otherwise
have gone unnoticed or uninen
tioned. And this movie, despite
the genre's trappings, makes it
worth seeing.
