is the next step for getting people

Collins said.
With regards to the future of
the NASA space program, Collins
envisioned what the next genera

"In future space< raft, we (an't

In the meantime, Collins and

The Mars Society
Maggie Zuhrin. a membei of
the Mars Sot ietv's hoard ol direc
tors, explained what the society
does in detail.
"The Northern California
i hapter is part ol .in internation
al group of over sevent\ chap
ters." Zuhrin said. "They're one
ol main < hapters who are work
ing on activities geared to help
j>et humans to Mars. I he whole
Mais Societ) is .111 organization
that helieves that hutnanit\
should not only visit Mars but es
tablish the presence on Mars and
possibly ,h .1 first step toward es
tablishing a presence in larger
solar systems in the cosmos."
Zuhrin said that while many
scientists are involved in the so
ciety its membership is not e\-
»lusive to acadeinia.

" I he activities at the confer
ence include reports on our
project activities throughout
the vear, including scientific re
search papers . . ~ but they also
include panels on art, litera
ture, 011 music, on government,
on law, on the sorts of life sup
port systems that would be re
quired to live in a hostile envi
ronment . . . because we believe
all these things make up civi
lization, not just technology,"
Zuhrin said.
She said that whereas the soci
ety has "members from NASA,
from astronaut corps, from
acadeinia, |it| also [has] mem
bers from the community-at
large. Some are educators, some
are housewives, some are food
service people."
Josh Bartel, a junior in sym
bolic svstems, attended the con
ference .is a volunteer.
Bartel said that he became
interested in the society when
"|he| read the book 'The Case
for Mars' by Robert Zubrin, [the

founder and president of the
society], and in his book he
mentioned the Mars Society."
Xubrin is formerly senior en
gineer of Martin Marietta Astro
nautics and is at the forefront of
the public debate for Mars ex
ploration. His activities have in
cluded testifying in front of
(Congress on the subject of Mars
exploration.
According to Bartel, the hook
states that "human exploration of
Mars is feasible with current tech
nology." I he book serves as a mini
bible lor many Mars enthusiasts.
Due to political considera
tions, it seems unlikely that a
manned spacecraft will take off
for Mars anytime soon. But that
won't keep the members of the
Mars Sot ietv from trying to reach
for the stars.
"The entire concept of form
ing this society was to reflect the
sort of broad cultural and societal
spectrum it will take to establish a
new branch of human civiliza
tion," Zubrin said.
