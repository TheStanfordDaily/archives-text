However, researehers toda\ have redi

hut no less significant eoneept rel.Hed to
these inventions â€” the process ol innova

magical inspiration that brought these prod

strategic innovative elldrt behind thein?
l od.iv, a m\ riad ol theories exists about how
and win innovations are developed.
" I he idea that innovation needs to de
pend pureh on inspiration, or a bku k art.or
is totalb intuitive. needs serious correction."
said ( |osluia Abend, former head ol the
Ski's International Innovation ('enter.
Prof Robert Ikirgelman at the Graduate
School of Business concurs. In his words,
"invention, discovery and innovation in
volve imagination and transpiration."

Most lesean hers agree that, .it a funda
mental level, imagination and creativit\
spark invention and innovation, but main
argue that creativit\ can onl\ be achieved
when inventors are given complete freedom
to let it i un wild.
J.unes \dams. professor emeritus of
management science and engineei mg and
author ol the industrial engineering c lassie
"Conceptual Blockbusting." wrote about
the relationship between innovation and
(ieati\ it\.
He describes a creative person as "both
more primitive and more cultured, more
destructive and more constructive, cra/ier
and saner, than the average person."
Large technolog\ companies have put
this idea into practice In injecting millions
of dollars into their research and develop
ment teams as part of their effort to pro
mote innovation. In the slowing economv,
analysts have lound that companies have
c ut back their overall expenses, but main
linns, sue h as Sun Mic ros\steins, are main
taining or even increasing their funding to
wards research and development. Microsoft
maintains a team of "distinguished engi
neers" at their campus, who are given a free
environment to play around with new ideas.
At the same time, some point out that
creativity will emerge from a business cul
ture that is open to it. Dr. Hd Chi, are

search scientist at Xerox PARC, believes
innovation begins at the individual level
and becomes a culture that "must be culti
vated from the motivation of the individu
als in that culture."
I hough creativity and innovation must
be encouraged lor companies to adapt to
the latest technologies and trends, such
processes can also easib disrupt an estab
lished company's practices.
"If you're doing something radical for
your business, you're going to shake up the
company and you'll need a separate organi
zation to earn on the innovative elfort lot

the rest of the company,' (ieorge Wester
m,m, .1 doctoral student at Harvard Busi
ness N( hool, said.
When a company is adopting a new stan
dard or practice, there is a need tor effective
management. Westerman emphasizes that,
in addition to promoting a hard-working,
exploratory and excited work culture, com
panies need managers who have a"a good
\ ision for where the business is going." I lie)
should also possess what he calls a "politic al
side" which allows them to stav infbrinalk in
touch with the old wa\ of thinking and
bridge to the new.
As innovation tarries with it the chal
lenges of change and adjustment, "firms that
are able to keep up with new technology
need to be ambidextrous," Westerman said.
Westerman's current research examines
how companies have handled the techno
logical revolution of the Internet, and the
successful strategies that have allowed some
companies to be adaptive to technological
change. 1 he failure of many dot-com com
panies has proved that a good idea is no
longer enough to succeed. Businesses must
be able to continue innovating and adapt
ing to new technologies to win the game of
survival.
