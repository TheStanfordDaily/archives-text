Most lesean hers agree that, .it a funda
mental level, imagination and creativit\
spark invention and innovation, but main
argue that creativit\ can onl\ be achieved
when inventors are given complete freedom

J.unes \dams. professor emeritus of
management science and engineei mg and
author ol the industrial engineering c lassie
"Conceptual Blockbusting." wrote about
the relationship between innovation and
(ieati\ it\.
He describes a creative person as "both
more primitive and more cultured, more
destructive and more constructive, cra/ier
and saner, than the average person."
Large technolog\ companies have put
this idea into practice In injecting millions
of dollars into their research and develop
ment teams as part of their effort to pro
mote innovation. In the slowing economv,
analysts have lound that companies have
c ut back their overall expenses, but main
linns, sue h as Sun Mic ros\steins, are main
taining or even increasing their funding to
wards research and development. Microsoft
maintains a team of "distinguished engi
neers" at their campus, who are given a free
environment to play around with new ideas.
At the same time, some point out that
creativity will emerge from a business cul
ture that is open to it. Dr. Hd Chi, are

search scientist at Xerox PARC, believes
innovation begins at the individual level
and becomes a culture that "must be culti
vated from the motivation of the individu
als in that culture."
I hough creativity and innovation must
be encouraged lor companies to adapt to
the latest technologies and trends, such
processes can also easib disrupt an estab
lished company's practices.
"If you're doing something radical for
your business, you're going to shake up the
company and you'll need a separate organi
zation to earn on the innovative elfort lot

the rest of the company,' (ieorge Wester
m,m, .1 doctoral student at Harvard Busi
ness N( hool, said.
When a company is adopting a new stan
dard or practice, there is a need tor effective
management. Westerman emphasizes that,
in addition to promoting a hard-working,
exploratory and excited work culture, com
panies need managers who have a"a good
\ ision for where the business is going." I lie)
should also possess what he calls a "politic al
side" which allows them to stav infbrinalk in
touch with the old wa\ of thinking and
bridge to the new.
As innovation tarries with it the chal
lenges of change and adjustment, "firms that
are able to keep up with new technology
need to be ambidextrous," Westerman said.
Westerman's current research examines
how companies have handled the techno
logical revolution of the Internet, and the
successful strategies that have allowed some
companies to be adaptive to technological
change. 1 he failure of many dot-com com
panies has proved that a good idea is no
longer enough to succeed. Businesses must
be able to continue innovating and adapt
ing to new technologies to win the game of
survival.

.iihl at the same time, you're ex
perimenting with new ways,"
Wcsterman said. "The best man
agers need to do both."
And these managers are
graduating from business
schools across the country as
universities expand their cur
i ic uluins to include the manage
ment of innovation.
Burgelman, who teaches a
i lass tided "Strategic Manage
ment of Technology and Inno
vation" .it the GSB, believes that
entrepreneurs are "the bridge
that connects invention and dis
covery to innovation." He sees
managers as "linking technolog
ic al solutions that derive from in
vention and discovery to real
c ustomer needs."
rnfortunately, acadeinia and
industry have not always had a
harmonious relationship with re
gards to innovation. According to
Burgelman, the reason is differing
interests: acadeinia values scientif
ic merit while industry desires
commercial potential.
\ ija\ I'ande, assistant professor
of chemistry, stressed the impor
tance of acadeinia.
" I he academic setting is real
!\ engineered towards innova
tion." I'ande said. " The universi
ty is where we can have really
cra/v ideas."
I'ande himself created

ual users' computers' processing
power to do his lab's biolotrv work

Still others contend that the
solution to stimulating innova
tion could be as simple .is using
the right tools to complement
human creativity. After leaving
SRI, Abend started his own
company whose mission is to
create "Certified Innovation
Masters." a phrase his compan)
has trademarked.
His company, Innovation
City, has developed a Web
based software that works to
help manage innovation pro
jects and improve collaboration
among team members.
"[Our product) doesn't replace
human imagination and decision
making, but it just multiplies its ef
fectiveness and accuracy by-ten
fold," Abend said.
Abend emphasized the impor
tance of innovation in today's
economy and predicts that prod
ucts such as his own will aid the
innovation process.
"Organizations, and perhaps
people as well, that can't learn or
adapt to that will find themselves
at the bottom of a very uneven
playing field," he said.
So what then is the key to cre
ativity? Despite all the methods
and theories of promoting inno
vation. some argue that innova
tion comes from necessity. The
urgency and stress of hard eco
nomic times in the past have been
a major driving force for innova
tions such as electricity and the
railroad.
Hie United States' greatest in
ventor, Thomas Edison, would
simplify the process further.
"To invent, you need a good
imagination and a pile of junk,"
Edison once said.

When a company is adopting a new stan
dard or practice, there is a need tor effective
management. Westerman emphasizes that,
in addition to promoting a hard-working,
exploratory and excited work culture, com
panies need managers who have a"a good
\ ision for where the business is going." I lie)
should also possess what he calls a "politic al
side" which allows them to stav infbrinalk in
touch with the old wa\ of thinking and
bridge to the new.
As innovation tarries with it the chal
lenges of change and adjustment, "firms that
are able to keep up with new technology
need to be ambidextrous," Westerman said.
Westerman's current research examines
how companies have handled the techno
logical revolution of the Internet, and the
successful strategies that have allowed some
companies to be adaptive to technological
change. 1 he failure of many dot-com com
panies has proved that a good idea is no
longer enough to succeed. Businesses must
be able to continue innovating and adapt
ing to new technologies to win the game of
survival.

Burgelman, who teaches a

entrepreneurs are "the bridge

managers as "linking technolog

c ustomer needs."
rnfortunately, acadeinia and
industry have not always had a

Burgelman, the reason is differing

commercial potential.
