# Counting sheep and studying narcolepsy
## 
### CHARLES FENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At one moment, a person could be laughing
without a care in the world. I lien suddenly, he or
slit' could be lost in a trance of deep sleep — an
other victim of the disorder known as narcolepsy.
"Narcolepsy is very interesting," said Km
manuel Mignot, an associate

professor of medicine in the
psychiatry department. "When
people are very tired, they go
straight into REM sleep—the
deep, dreaming sleep."
Normally, a person goes into

RKM — rapid eye movement —one-and-a- Q
half hours after falling asleep. A narcoleptic,
however, often goes into a dissociate state in
which they are halt in RKM and half awake. Con
sequently, a number of symptoms result: tempo
rary paralysis, exhaustion, hallucination and
even cataplexy, a condition in which a person
collapses when excited.
When Mignot first arrived at Stanford 15 years
ago, he realized that by studying narcolepsy — a
disease that affects one in 2000 people — he could
understand more about sleep in general. Accord
ing to Mignot, it was also a medical problem that
few scientists addressed .it the time.
At that time, William Dement, a professor of
medicine in the psychiatry department and
Mignot's mentor, had already begun to study fam
ilies of dogs in which narcolepsy was hereditary.
Initially, Mignot studied the pharmacological
mechanisms associated with the dogs' narcolepsx.
"Then I decided that we'll never find [a treat
ment] unless we get the gene," Mignot said. "1 de
cided to search for the gene in dogs, though many
said that it was going to be impossible."
Starting from scratch, Mignot developed his
own gene libraries and genetic markers. Using a
method known as positional cloning — a process
where a gene is found based on its location in a
chromosome — Mignot chipped away at the gi
gantic task at hand.
In 1999, after an exhaustive 10-year search,
Mignot determined that the culprit was the

hypocretin receptor-2 gene.
Fortuiu plaved a hand in Mignot's fortune,
l he chemical hvpocretin, found in the brain, had
been discovered onl\ a year before and had been
implii ated in processes invoh ing hunger. I lowev
er, Mignot realized that, in dogs, there was a imi
tation in which hypot ret ill's receptors were defec
tive, therein explaining the cause of narcolepsy.
"People were very excited, think-

ing (hypocretinj was .1 feeding chemi
cal, but nobody had an idea it was re
lated i<> narcolepsy," Mignot n«ii<l.
Because narcolepsy is rarely
hereditan in humans, Mignot still had
to figure out the mechanism that

caused the disorder in people — though
this would be mm h easier, since the gene
had already been identified.

lii 2000, Mignot concluded thai in humans, it is
not the receptor that is abnormal, but tlit* produc -
lion of the hypocretin itself.
"We are not exactly sure why [the production
of hypocretin is abnormal], but we think it's due
to an autoimmune process where the immune
system gets activated and kills its own cells,"
Mignot said.
Since hypocretin and its receptor lit like a lock
and a key, if scientists can effectively produce a
hvpocretin-imitating molecule, they could theo
retically trick the li\ pocretin receptors. It's akin to
giving insulin to diabetics.
Mignot estimates that pharmaceutical compa
nies will likely develop a hypocretin drug within
the next few years. But this would be only a treat
ment. not .1 cure. For eliminating narcolepsy alto
gether, Mignot thinks transplanting cells that can
produce hvpocretin could be the solution. This
may be another application of the hotly debated
topic of stem cell research.
Mignot is now changing his focus from dogs to
other animals, including rats, mice and zebra fish.
He plans to explore the effects of hypocretin on
other sleep-related disorders. He suggested that
the chemical even may have effects on normal
sleep regulation.
"\\ e still have an entire physiology to discover."
Mignot said.
