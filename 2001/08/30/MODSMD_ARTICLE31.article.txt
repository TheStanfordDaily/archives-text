Islaiulia, N.Y. (AP) — Savoring
a victory Ibi control ot (lomputci
Associates Ititn iiation.il Inc., com
pan\ founder and i hail man
Charles Wang insisted vestcrclav
that shareholders were standing
In him and his management team.
"We are grateful lot their sup
port and committed to justifying
theii faith in us. Wang told re
porters after 7~> percent ol share
holders who voted rejected a slate
ol new board members ba< ked l>\
I exas billionaire Nam W\ Iv.
But W ang, who started the soft
ware giant LT) years ago with three
other people, conceded that the
battle over the future ola company
that now has 18,000 employees
"was a rather sobering experience."
Alter lending oil claims that lit
is overpaid and that the coinpanv
mistreats its emplovees and cus
tomers, Wang acknowledged that

"we need to better communicate
all the good things we are doing
lor our ( ustotnei s."
W ang also announced that the
company will name two new out
side board members to serve
alongside the 10 incumbents who
were re-elected pending final re
sults in two weeks, and will contin
ue ongoing ellorts to improve ( us
toiner service to the large corpo
rate clients it serves.
Without the pressure he exert
ed, Wvl\ said. Computer Associ
ates would have never pledged
changes in the way it will do busi
ness — claims denied In Wang,
who said most ol the ellorts were
already underway before the
proxy fight started last |une.
In his campaign stalling in |une,
W vly at tat ked Wang and other ex
ecutives lor lav ish salaries and st<x k
packages. He also said Computer

Associates stock has underper
fonnecl over the last live years.
But that argument didn't seem
to resonate with shareholders well
aware that the coinpanv's shares
have iiu i eased in value this year by
about two-thirds while man) tecli
nologA companies have seen then
sloe k pi ues plummet.
Anabsts had predicted W'yl)
would tail. Karlier this month lie
abandoned hope of winning out
right control ol the member board
and installing himself aschairman.
Also, about 30 percent of the
coinpanv's shares are held In in
siders. 01 people affiliated with the
company.
W'vlv, who sold Nterling Soft
ware to Computet Associates last
yeai for Si billion, suffered a
huge setback when the Comput
er Associates' largest sharehold
er. Swiss investor Walter Haefn

er, quit klv threw his support to
management.
Computer Associates, based in
Islaudia, makes software that
helps run big mainframe comput
ers for corporate c lients. 1 .ast year,
it lost S.'»ol million on sales ol 54.2
billion, and laced criticism for its
accounting practices and the SI
billion paid over the past live years
to Wang and c hief executive San
jay Kumar.
W'vlv's Ranger Covernance
Ltd., which controls about
630,000 shares and has options
for another 1.5 million, wanted to
carve Computer Associates into
four units and perhaps spin them
oil as separate companies. Ana
lysts and investors panned the
idea, saying the company benefit
ed from cross-selling and from its
sheer si/e.
In his own news conference

after the vote, Wyly did not dis
close any actions he might take in
the future but said he would con
tinue to monitor the company to
make sure ii follows through with
changes in its culture and corpo
rate governance.
"We thought the contest
would shine sunlight on a com
pany that needed sunlight," he
said. "And we're real happy that
happened."
(lomputer Associates says it has
already made many of the
changes Wyly pledged, including
putting more outsiders on the
hoard, trying to improve cus
tomer relations and considering
changes to make its financial re
sults easier to understand.
Shares of Computer Associates
fell 71 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $112
yesterday on the New York Stock
Kxchange.
