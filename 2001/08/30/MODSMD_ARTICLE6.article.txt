Friday, after the culmination of a
three-month search.
"I am delighted that Gene
Awakuni has accepted our offer to
become Stanford's next vice
provost for student affairs," Hen
nessy said in the announcement.
"Gene brings an extraordinary
combination of intelligence, acad
emic credentials and breadth of

area of student affairs and has
earned the deep respect of under

professional colleagues with

the College Board. A 12-member
search committee headed In Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Kdu
cation |ohn Bravman looked at
more than 50 applicants before
giving President I lennessy a short
list of whom they believed were
the top candidates for the posi
tion. The president and Provost
John Ktcheinendy then chose
Awakuni from among the names
on the short list.
According to Jeff Wachtel,
special assistant to the president
and provost and staff to the
search committee, the committee
was looking for an administrator
who is able to balance the some
times conflicting groups on cani
pus, whit li Awakuni demonstrat

ed lie could do at Columbia and
other posts.
"We wanted somebody who
could balance the interests of stu
dents and the academic mission of
the University,'' Wachtel said.
"We also were looking for some
one who has shown concern for
students. |Awakuni | understood
the academic purpose of a univer
sity like Stanford, having worked
at Columbia.
"1 le demonstrated a deep sensitiv
ity to the needs of students. Ix>th un
dergraduate and graduate. He un
derstands the difficulties stu
dents face, and he has addressed
important issues like student
health, housing issues and hate
speech throughout his career."
Awakuni began his career in
student affairs as the spec ial assis
tant to the vice i hancellor for stu
dent affairs at I C.-Irvine. He was
later recruited to I C-Santa Bar

1 le moved to Ins post at ('.oluinbia
in July 2000.
Currently Awakuni is working
on a health care plan and a projei I
to improve primary care for stu
dents at C Columbia.
"(iene Awakuni is a very expe
rienced person in the field ol stu
dent allairs," VVachtel said. " I he
references from students, faculty
and colleagues [with whom he has
worked) were uniformly superb.
He is highly respected by people
and has been effective in his roles
at various institutions."
Other committee members
echoed VVachtel's sentiments re
garding Awakuni's confrontation
of tough issues and experience in
student affairs.
"At (Columbia, he has experi
ence in a ver\ similar, but larger

organization," said Wendelin
Wright, a doctoral candidate in
materials science and engineer
ing and one of two student repre
sentatives on the search commit
tee. "He has alread\ confronted
tot mil housiim and health care is


James Montoya
sui's. I believe thai his extensive
experience in student affairs at
(lolumbia, ( al Polv Pomona, and
I (SB will enable him to jump
right into hi> job and start ad
dressing .md solving problems. 1
think thai Ins stall will enjoy
working with him and that stu
dents will (jnit kl\ come to know
.md like him."
Awaknni leaches courses on
imilticiiltiiralism and psychology
.ii (Columbia, and he recently co
authored a book titled "Resis
tance lo Mullii ulturalism: Issues
and Interventions."
"I feel like being in a classroom
helps me understand the stu
dents from a different vantage
point," Awakuni told the Stan
lord News Service.
W'achtel said that Montoya was
uniquely dose to students, and
ih.it Awakuni should not be com

pared to his predecessor.
"Jim Montoya was fabulous
and was loved by students,"
Wachtel said. "We tried to find
somebody who could do a great
job, although maybe nol in the
same way as [Montoya]. [Awaku
-11 i | will do a great job, but his
manner and style are different,
and how he approaches the job
will be different."
I he 112 uture vice provost lot stu
dent affairs said he was impressed
with Stanford .it first sight.
"As I walked onto campus, I
was just amazed," Awakuni said
following the announcement. "I'll
get to work with the best and tin
brightest students from all over
the world. Stanford is an extraor
dinary place."
