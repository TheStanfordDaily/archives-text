# Camp helps high schoolers study, pursue mathematics
## Students experience 'pure mathematics’ in four-week camp 
### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford University Mathemat
ics Clamp, an intensive summer
camp held .it Synergy, aims to bring
mathematically talented high
school students to campus for four
weeks of serious mathematical pur
suits.
"[The camp] is for high school
students that are exceptionally good
at mathematics and are very moti
vated," Rick Sominer, director of
the camp, said.
I'his year, thirty-five students
from twelve states and I foreign
countries attended the camp.
"Kveryone gets something, from
increased knowledge and apprecia
tion of 'mathematics to the chance to
make connections and leave with a
good feeling about mathematics,"
Sominer said. "We want to encour
age students to progress with math
ematics."
"It's a long time In-fore vou get
exposed to higher mathematics" in
high school. Sominer said. " The
mathematics in the curriculum is
geared towards science and engi

neering, not people who are going
to become math majors."
"The usual mathematics se
quence at the advanced high school,
and beginning college level, takes
students through courses designed
lor the pursuit of science and engi
neering. leading to topics that are
motivated almost entirely by the
subject's applicability to 'real-world'
problems." according to the Web
site.
1 'he camp "leaps ahead in the se
quence to give a glimpse of ad
vanced material appropriate for
those with a genuine interest in
mathematics," according to the
Web site. " Topics covered at (the
camp) are included in various col
lege math courses at alxnit the ju
nior level, but the topics are not pre
sented in tluTorm.itof the usual col
lege c c >iirses where 11 lev wc mid ord i
tiarilv be introduced. In order to
reasonabh give talented high s< hool
students a glimpse of sue h advanced
topics in only four weeks, the mate
rial is streamlined and not devel
oped to the extent it would lx* in a
university course."
I he camp "uses topics that are
central to the field of mathematics
through their historical significance
and their relevance to current lines
of mathematical research. Ihe
courses focus on pure
mathematics — that is, mathemat

us that is motivated independent!)
of ties to other sciences — nonethe
less, important applications ait* in
troduced and pursued," according
to the Web site.
I he camp offers two courses.
The first program, designed and
taught by Sommer, involves uncon
siructibility in geometry, classifica
tion of patterns in two dimensions,
error-correcting codes, cryptogra
phy, and the analysis of the Rubik's
tube. Ihe second, designed and
taught by Clark Bray, an instructor
in the Mathematics Department, is
an introduction to topics in combi
natorial. differential and algebrau
topol< >gv.
l he programs also strive to teach
students alxmt the historical devel
opment ol mathematics.
I he camp includes a guided re
search project that allows students
to pursue an area of interest, a guest
lecture series, group problem-solv
ing sessions, tutoring, social events
and outings.
The camp was founded in 1995
by Professors Rate Ma//eo and
Ralph (lohen of the Stanford Math
ematics Department.
I he Program II course, with
new content for 2001, is designed
and taught by (-lark Hra\. Bray is an
instructor in the Stanford Mathe
mat its Department and has been in
volved with the camp lor over live
vears. I he counseling and tutoring

stall consistsol Stanford mathemat
ics graduate students and under
graduate math majors.
I lie application process involves
teac her recommendations, an .id
missions exam and standardized
math exams.
"We received over 70 applica

lions, many of them highly quali
fied, since our application process is
fairly rigorous; however, we limit
enrollment to 35," Sonnner said,
"hi past years we have had students
from Mexico, Jamaica, Spain,
Luvia, Serb, Taiwan, Japan, Latvia,
.md I .uxembourg."
