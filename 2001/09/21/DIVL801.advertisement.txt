Brewer and Cordero Discuss Future
We hope to strike a balance between short-term vic
tories that allow students to reap direct benefits from
our term in office and long-term advocacy that will
strengthen the position of students in the future. Spe
cific areas of locus include fostering diverse environ
ments, supporting artistic expression, enhancing stu
dent group resources and forming creative transporta
tion alternatives. Such issues and approaches listed
below reveal the impossibility of completion by two
people, or even 10 people. If we do not work with oth
ers, then we will not work for others. We truly strive to
make the ASSU a resource for all students.
ABCD: A New Era of Accountability
In order to create future generations of ASSU account
ability and student awareness, we aim to implement
permanent communication mechanisms. During this
upcoming year, we w ill communicate through the fol
lowing means:
• The Stanford Daily - The ASSU will have a weeklv
half-page insert in The Daily, which will probably serve
as our most prolific form of communication with Stan
ford and the surrounding community.
• ASSU Website —The website lias been completely re
designed and will be updated regularly to serve as an
information resource for everyone, with an added em
phasis on student groups resources.
• KZSU - The ASSU will host a 15-20 minute seg
ment of a news radio show entitled "Farm Side
Ghats." The radio airtime will serve as a resource for
student groups, upcoming events and ASSU repre
sentatives to advocate, educate and inspire interest in
issues and events.
• ASSU Newsletter- The ASSU will distribute a bi
weekly newsletter through the post office. The newslet
ter will be complete with upcoming events and cam
