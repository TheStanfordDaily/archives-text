A MESSAGE FROM PHI BETA KAPPA, STANFORD CHAPTER
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the excellence and breadth of
their undergraduate scholarly accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of
California) is open to undergraduates of all majors. To be elected to Phi Beta Kappa at
Stanford, a student must achieve academic distinction in the major as well as in courses across
a broad range of fields.
Approximateh a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of
this number, about one fifth are chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
T he Chapter 's election guidelines define breadth of stildv as excellence beyond the major field,
lo be considered for election, a student must have taken, by the time elections are held early
in the Spring Quarter, at least three courses at Stanford in each of the following three major
domains of knowledge: Humanities; Science, Engineering and Math; and Social Sciences. To
be considered for election, students who transfer in their junior year must have taken at least
two courses at Stanford in two of these major domains and at least one in the third domain,
and must have completed a minimum 75 units of academic work at Stanford by the end of
Winter Quarter.
1 vamples of courses that will satisfy the Phi Beta Kappa breadth criterion include those listed
in the BIT I I UNI for the undergraduate General Education Requirements (GER) in Areas 2 to
4. Courses taken for GER Area 1 will not be considered as satisfying the PBK breadth criteri
on.
A grade of "+" or "CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally satisfying the
"breadth" criterion is not considered a sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is
required for students wishing to be considered for membership. Anonymity in the election
process is ensured by removal of students' names from their academic records before consid
eration. Students who desire that their records not be made available for consideration by the
Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the Registrar, room 133, Old Union.
