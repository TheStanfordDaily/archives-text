5 Good Reasons Why
You Should License Your Bike:

2. Theft Prevention & Recovery —Sends a warning to would-be thieves.
Registration information including the serial number, is available to law
enforcement agencies.
3. Increases the likelihood of your stolen bike being found and returned.
4. Identification —Provides a means of identifying who you are in case you
crash or your bike is stolen.
5. It's Inexpensive —A new license costs $3.50, renewals/$2.50 & both are
valid for up to 3 years.
