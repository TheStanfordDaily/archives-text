In the beginning the Word already existed. He was with God, and He was God. Life itself
was in Him, and this life gives light to everyone. So the Word became human and lived
here on earth among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness. We have all ben
efited from the rich blessings He brought to us —one gracious blessing after another.
