1929
( )m Sep. 21, 1962, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about the I listory of 1 ake Lagunita.
"Like Lagunita Dates back to earlier than
1S8:< w hen it was originally dug with mules
,ni(l scrapers and dammed up with the earth
that had been excavated. It was designed ini
iiall\ as a reservoir to supply irrigation water
primarily lor 100 acres ol alfalfa on the land
now oc( upied by the University buildings.
" lo keep the water from draining
through the porous soil ol the lake bottom,
Senator Stanford tried to seal the bottom by
having 2,000 sheep trample the soil.
"When the University was built, the irriga
tion need for the lake was greatly reduced,
and subsequently, Stanford and others began
to reali/e the value of letting the lake water
seep through the bottom to replenish the un
derground well-water supply."
Bottom line: Asses dragging in Hie dirt for alfalfa ir
rigation. Don't say that's not funny.
