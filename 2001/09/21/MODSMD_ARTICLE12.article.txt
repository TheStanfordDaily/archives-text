In American Scientist magazine this
year.; Stanford University biophysicist
Steven Block gave a chilling account
of the threat from bio-weapons, de
scribing them as 'the poor man's atom
bomb \
The doomsday terrorist scenario
has always revolved around a brief
case nuke\ But the reality is that con
structing an atomic bomb is expensive
and extremely difficult.
Germs, on the other hand, are
cheap and easy to make. A vaccinated
terrorist could plant his deadly cargo
and sneak away days before any ef
fects 7cere noticed.
Professor Block says three known
diseases — smallpox, anthrax and
ebola — plus an unknown number of
genetically engineered organisms,
could be unleashed.
Only two supplies of the smallpox
virus are known to exist. One is in the
US. The other is in Russia.
