### ROBIN BURNS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For incoming student hewildered In
names such .is Fro Sot o, So( o and IroYo,
die results ol Stanford's pent haul loi abbre
viation just got a liiilc harder to figure out.
11 lis vear, c hanges to the Ireshtnan ad\ is
ing s\stem iiu lude new n.lines and abbtev ia
tions foi three compoueiiis ol the academic
advising team, .is well .is new features to the
online inlbrm.ition s\ su-m \\css — and a bit
ol contusion among the student bod\.
I he most obvious new leature in Iresh
inaii advising this wai is iis nomenclature.
Last year's Freshman Advisors (!• \s), mem
bers ol the Stanford liu uli\ and stall, are now
Academic \d\ isors. or AAs.
"l he old title didn't accuratelv repre
sent the role out advisois plaved," s.iid the
I ndergraduate Advising (.enter's <lircc -
tor. fori White.
()ne problem w.is that I As help students
until tliev dec lare then major and find .1 new
advisoi within theii department, resulting in
sophomores who had not vet dec lared woi k
ing with "Freshman Advisors."
In addition, alter students shortened
"Freshman Advisor" to "FA." m.inv mis
translated the abbreviation into "l ac 11 li\ \d
visor." and not .ill advisors were members ol
the Stanford lacultv.
I he c liange set oil .1 small domino ellec t:
student advisors, previously "Advising \sso
ciates," are now "I'eei Vadctnic Vdvisors,"
(PAAs), and the student heads ol the resi
dential advising teams .ire now "Head I'eei
Academic Coordinators." (IIIW(s) instead
ol I lead Advising Assoc i.iles, (I I \As).
"I encourage returning students to use
the new names so .is not to confuse the in
coining students." s.iid White.
I he other major c hanges in the .id\ising
svstem relate to the new \\ess program that
debuted 1 his sunimer. Students no longci
need to receive .111 approval code from theii
adv isoi to register 101 courses online.
file new Axcss software w.is pure based .is
a "canned" program.
" I he svstem itsell doesn't have the capa
bilities to produce advising codes .is we've
used them at Stanford." White said.
l he new \\css also makes it easier loi

advisors to \ iew ac ademic information ol
their students.
Stanford students expressed mixed views
ol the p.lst advising svstem.
"|Mv FA| was gte.it. and reallv involved
with mv doi 111. so I s.iw her all the time," said
one junior.
Others, however, are more critical. "Mv
| freshman] adv isoi was cool, but I didn't rec -
ogni/e mv \A w hen she said hi to me wintei
quarter," s.iid sophomore ('ara Bertron.
Sophomore (,heng Wang complained
that his 112 \ would "schedule a meeting and
nevei show," while sophomore Farth Svs
tcms major ( In is Kost had .111 aclv isor who
"had heard ol the [F.artli Svstenis| depart
ment, l>ut that was about the extent of it."
Almost .ill students feel that the svstem
could benefit from change, but some ex
pressed doubt that the new names will sigmf
ic .inilv improve advising.
One sophomore described a member ol
Ins advising group last vear whose "vear
turned out prettv badlv overall because [Ins
advisors | just wei cut pushing him to change
his beliav ior."
\s this vear's ihanges are implemented,
the adv s\ stem will continue to be evalu
ated: the I \( will use iliis vear to test the el
lec 1 sol hav ing 110 codes and ie-\isii the ques
tion next sunimer il necessary.
