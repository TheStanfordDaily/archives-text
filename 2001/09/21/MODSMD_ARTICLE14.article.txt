### NICHOLAS CHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
I oda\, 1,700 new faces appeared on c ampus as part of
the (ilass ol 2005. But one these new laces is not a new stu
dent — he's ,i new administrator. In the- midst of his wot k
at Columbia I nivetsit\, new Vice Provost lor Student Al
lairs (icne \wakuni llew to campus from New York to
speak at (Convocation.
I his summer, Awakuni, the current N ice President lor
Student Sen ie es .it (olumbia, was chosen h\ a committee ol
12 members to till the position vacated In lormer Vice
Provost 11in Montova. Montoya left to assume the new l\ c re
ated position ol vice president ol the (ollege Hoard.
Although Awakuni will not assume the role of Vice
Provost until Januan. he has alreach begun thinking about
w hat the Stanford position entails.
"first and foremost, tlu- \ PSA must help students ac hieve
theii ac ademic , personal and professional goals," Awakuni
said. I le .tlso mentioned the iinportance ol "c re.iting a (am
pus environment that is respectful of dillerences and wel
coming lor all students, regardless ol race, c ulture or na
tional origin."
At ting as a liaison between students and administration as
well as within the dillerent branches ol the administration
also rank among his top priorities.
In light ol recent events. Aw. ikuni also said that "ensuring
that the salet\ and rights ol students are protected, especial-
Iv gi\en the tragic events ol the past week, are ol paramount
impoi tance.'
I heattac kson New Yoi k ( it\ caused Awakuni loc hange
his plans. "M\ initial thought was to graclualh sluli in\ at
tention from ( olumbia to Stanford over the course ol the fall
[ quarter J," he said, "lint bee ause ol the \\ oriel 1 rade ('.enter
tragech. much ol m\ time will probabh be spent trving to
help students and stall cope with ihc emotional trauma and
personal upheaval the tragech has eaused."
Although lie ac knowledged that the lives ol all Anieri
c ans have c hanged ovei the past week. Awakuni also said
that "man), mam individuals ai (.olumbia have been th
ree tlv inipacted."
Despite the recent events, Awakuni has siill it ied to be a
part ol lite- at Stanford. I lie siall at tlu- \ ice Provost foi I n
dergraduate Ixlucation's Olliee has been sending him the
latest information from Stanford, as well .is bat kground in
loi ination on the () I lie eof Student Allails and the campus in
genei al. In addition, he lias at tivel\ Ibllowed lilt* at Stan lord
through the I niversih's Web siie.
()nce Awakuni resumes his role al Stanford, he plans to
solie H the input ol students aiiel lac ult\ before deciding on a
spec ilit plan of at lion.
"M\ preliniin.il \ plan is to meel as main people as possi
ble dm ing the spi ing semester and do a lot ol listening," he
said." It would be presumptuous of me to sa\ what m\ goals
are without lirst having immersed mvsell in the Stanford

(till nix* .md learning first-hand what the needs ol students,
st.ill .md l.u ilit\ are."
Ile believes thai .ill paities who will he aflected b\ a deci
sion should take pat I in the dec ision process Idi both long
term .md short-term goals.
Although Awakuni s.iid he didn't have anv specific pro
je( is in mind, he s.iid he would probabh work with the stall
,ii (.owell Health Services and the ( areer Development
('enter on then new building projects. I le would also like to
help out with planning and development ol new graduate
student housing.
Awakuni was (liosen b\ a (oinniittee ol 12 lacultv, stall
and students from among ."»(• prospective candidates. The
(onunillee then selet ted live people tot oine to campus lor a
( ompi ehensive interview.
