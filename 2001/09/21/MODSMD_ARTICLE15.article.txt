## The 						Stanford Daily Breaking the bubble to find meaning in wreckage 
### 
Published Since 1891

The world breaks everyone and af
terward, many are strong in bro
ken places.
— Ernest Hemingway
Arriving on campus brings a sense of
peace to everyone who spent hours in front
of CNN last week, watching airline jets
crash into buildings and explode in flames.
It's calm here, among the Foothills and
red-tiled buildings. All the trees are green.
All the people are nice. All the bikes are in
their upright and locked positions.
Welcome to Stanford — and welcome to
the Stanford bubble. Fven more than other
college campuses, Stanford is isolated from
the everyday grit of real life. Unlike some
university students, we don't pass bv home
less people sleeping on campus or need sev
eral keys and a check from a security guard
to get to our dorm rooms.
The terrorist events of last week prove,
however, that our previous conceptions of

safety are no longer the same. If airplanes
can be hijacked, if 6,000 innocent people
can perish in their office buildings, if the
Pentagon can be attacked, then anything
can happen.
When a bomb threat caused the evacua
tion of I loover lower, Meyer Library and
Creen Library on Sept. 11, 2001, it was a
tangible indication of how our concept of
safety in daily life was profoundly changed.
Fach generation is shaped by the nation
al hardships it faces. ()ur grandparents are
the products of the World War 11. Our par
ents are the products of Vietnam. Surely
the terrorist attacks are one of the life
changing events that will form the values of
our generation.
Implications of the attacks will ripple on
forever. Will we still fly across the country
unthinkingly? Will we still want to work in
skyscrapers? Will we still line up to see mas
sive explosions in movies?
The important thing to realize is that

the implications can be positive as well as
negative. In many ways, the reaction
across America has been inspiring. Nearly
every American is thinking about what
our country stands for, looking to reli
gion's values in this time of crisis and mak
ing visual statements with flags about our
country's solidarity.
Perhaps history will record the begin
ning of the 21st century as a period of
rededication to America's values of free
dom, democracy and diversity.
1 larassing Americans who descended
from the Middle East or who follow Islam
not only shakes our country's resolve, but
it's exactly what the terrorists longed for.
We are a nation of immigrants. To attack
each other would be to attack America's val
ues. This was the terrorists' true objective,
but they could only aim jets at buildings.
The days of orientation will introduce
you to an overwhelming array of activities,
making it seductively simple to narrow
