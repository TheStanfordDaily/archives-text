# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Analysis brings answers 
### MEGAN KNIZE GUEST COLUMNIST 
Tlit' old city of Jerusalem was gold
en and magical w hen I saw it three
weeks ago. Night had fallen and I
was sitting on the roof of our hotel, look
ing down onto .1 beautiful, seetningh
peaceful city. 1 was talking to one ol m\
closest friends about the bombed street
corners, dozens ol Israeli soldiers and
strangely quiet streets we had seen that
day. talking, analyzing and writing were
the only ways we could begin to under
stand what we, 18 college journalists, were
doing, seeing and feeling in Israel, a land
rife with conflict.
As you return to Stanford and struggle
to understand what you've seen on televi
sion during the last two weeks. 1 can oiler
only this advice: the deep, honest conver
sations 1 had abroad with mv peers are just
what needs to happen right here.
We were a group of enthusiastic college
newspaper editors from the nation's top
schools, determined to see the world and
learn about Kastern Europe and the Arab-
Israeli conflict on a two-week trip to
Poland, Bulgaria and Israel. We had .111
amazing time. I 've never laughed so much
or felt so happy before. But we also saw so
much pain: the death c amps at Auschwitz,
the gypsy communities 111 Poland and the
Sbarro's pizzeria in Jerusalem th.it had
been bombed the week before.
Nearly every night, I was greatly im
pressed and comforted when .1 small
group of my friends and I gathered in
someone's room and just talked. We were
practically strangers, setting off to spend
a week in one of the most volatile regions
of the world. Simply being together as
students helped us make sense of an in
tense week.
Quite honestly, Israel intimidated
most of us. We had partied in Poland
and Bulgaria, and we tried not to take
the daily BBC footage of the West Bank
too seriously.
Before leaving for Israel, we were scru
tinized by the tight security at El A1 air
lines. We sat silently on the tout bus as we
drove 112 rom the airport to Tel Aviv.
But in the city, things were calm. And I
felt safe —on the few occasions when I
didn't, I told myself that I would be going
home soon. Every day, after our hikes and

speakers, dinners and tours, we wei e (on
fused. I lungs were mm li more complicat
ed than am of us had thought. We talked
about how we felt .is .Vmerit.ins, .is student
journalists, and whether we could do any
thing about our feelings.
1 hose talks were encouraging: we
were all bright college students and after
the ti ip, we would have the abilit\ — and
the obligation — to make the world less
frightening.
Last I uesdav. I did what most of you
did: 1 watched the news in shock,
checked im e-mail and < ailed mv friends
from the trip.
Of all the people 1 know and trust,
these other students gave me the most
comfort that dav. 1 never expected to
need them so unit h. We understood eat h
other, and I have great hopes th.it the
bond I saw on the trip among students
from 1S different st hools can bet ome just
as strong in a dorm, a club or a i lass right
here on campus.
111 the past week, I've watched college
students and broadcasters alike speak on
IV about the apath\ of Our generation,
led Koppel, class of 19(>2, said this week
end that Stanford students are some of the
"most irreverent" in the world, judging
from the e-mail discussions that I've seen
so far about the terror attacks, that's ab
solutely not true. So bravo.
But I encourage you not to let the dia
logue drop after you move in and settle
back into life at Stanford. I encourage you
not to stop reading the newspaper, not to
stop thinking, discussing and analyzing.
Through the pain and confusion we're
feeling right now, we can have magical dis
cussions and talk about solutions. I've seen
it happen.
1 watched another journalist this week
end: a favorite of mine. Andy Rooney. In a
stirringly patriotic speech, he spoke to all
Americans, but I'd like to think he was also
speaking especially to college students.
He said that if Americans can feel the
same sense of togetherness that they did
during World War 11, I'om Brokaw's
"Greatest (ieneration" will have to make
room for another. Let's prove him right.
