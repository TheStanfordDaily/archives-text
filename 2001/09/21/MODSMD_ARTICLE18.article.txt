Direct your outrage where it belongs
I sit before m\ tele\ ision just da) s after
the bleakest, blackest hour in American
history. My entire screen is taken over h\
the confused and scared face of a voting
American bov of Arabian descent, with
tear-stained cheeks, expressing his ap
prehension in returning to school, for
fear of the harassment and hostility he
may encounter.
His mother cries as she tells us that her
children are home from school todav, and
for however mail) days, as she fears for
their safety as Muslims. She proceeds to
say she is an American — not even first
and foremost, but totally and completely
American. Just like you. J list like me.
After the brutal attack on Pearl I iarbor
in 1941, Americans reacted in an under
standable state of panic. Unfortunately,
this spurred a massive animosity towards
Japanese-Americans — citizens of this
great country — and inconceivable mea
sures were then taken. We imprisoned
our own people in our own form of con
centration camps merely for appearing
Asian, giving way to one of the ugliest,
most shameful moments in recent Ameri
can history.
Never in my life have I encountered a
person who finds this warranted, jutifiable
or forgivable, and 1 hope to God that I
never do. In retrospect, evtfn with the lives
so unnecessarily lost at Pearl Harbor still
in mind and memory, we all know forcing
innocent Japanese-Americans into inhu

mane camps was disgusting and wrong on
so many different levels.
Although internment camps seem ab
solute!) impossible in America toda\, vio
lent acts of hate against people, sadly, re
main common. Now, again in a most un
derstandable state of panic and fear, we
as Americans must make a most concert
ed effort to hinder any form of negative
backlash towards its American people of
Middle Kastern descent. We must not
create a trend that we as a people will un
doubtedly regret in years to come, just .is
we undoubtedly regret and abhor our
post-Pearl Harbor treatment of Japan
ese-Americans.
To attack your American neighbor for
merely looking Middle Kastern is the same
as attacking your Caucasian neighbor,
your black neighbor or your Jewish neigh
bor. There is no difference between us
American citizens. To attack one is to at
tack us all, just as in attacking the World
Trade Center, the Pentagon and the four
planes, the terrorists attacked us all. To
turn on your American brother is stupid.
It is counterproductive to the bond we
must now be solidifying.
And it is under this mentality that we
must collect our unspeakable anger, direct
all of our energies to those accountable,
and compile ;ill of our resources to unite as
one American agent against these savage
terrorists, these ruthless, murdering ene
mies. We cannot afford to splinter as a so
ciety; now, more than ever in our history,
we must form the strongest, most tin

breakable bond.
Hate your Middle Kastern-appearing
neighbor, and you give those terrorist bas
tards just what they want. You satisfy only
them. As a country, as a world, we do not
have energy to waste on innocent citizens
when iu the face of such evil. Please, in the
name of God, peace, love and all that is
just, true and right, keep your anger fo
cused on the enemy who deserves it.
I his is the 21st century, and racism and
bigotry have no place in this world that has
become so small. They are antiquated in
stitutions, speaking only to ignorance and
total misconception. We have lost too
many lives, paid too great a price and
fought too many battles in the name of
eliminating racism to regress so fast.
The reverberations of Sept. 11, 2001
have gone incredibly far. Please do not
allow the tragedy to spread even further.
Do your part to spread only messages of
love, concern and compassion to every last
citizen of America, no matter their creed,
color or religion.
Continue to pray for the families most
deeply affected by this tragedy, for the
lives lost, for the most courageous heroes
behind the rescue efforts, for every last cit
izen of this great nation and for the victo
ry of all that is right and good over a most
unspeakable evil.

Commercial flights resume 'too soon'

Recently, Secretary of I ransportation

mercial flights to resume, under suppos

are told that President (ieorge W. liush

a ouick return to normalcy, in order to

build confidence in the American public
and to show the world that we will not be
deterred b\ this heinous ac t ol terrorism.
I"he principle is good — returning to
nonnalc). not bowing to the aggressor.
But since Mineta lifted tlu- (light ban, news
agencies have reported that securit\ per
sonnel have detained several individuals
lor violating airport securit\ standards.
I mil questioning and an investigation un
lold. noboclv c.in s.i\ whether these were
lalse alarms or a second wave ol terrorist

I hese events shattei even that tenuous

Is ilu- return to normalcy worth the risk
ol letting something like this slip through?

What would happen to public confidence
(not to speak ol human lives) il terrorists
somehow managed to board another
plane and earn out theii insanitv today,
tomorrow? What is the rush? Are we being
too arrogant about our own invinc ibilitv
— still, somehow, after what happened
on 1 ucsd.iN — to be blind to this risk?
Meanwhile, we owe it to ourselves and
to the memory of those we lost to do
everything we can to prevent more

Direct your outrage where it belongs
I sit before m\ tele\ ision just da) s after
the bleakest, blackest hour in American
history. My entire screen is taken over h\
the confused and scared face of a voting
American bov of Arabian descent, with
tear-stained cheeks, expressing his ap
prehension in returning to school, for
fear of the harassment and hostility he
may encounter.
His mother cries as she tells us that her
children are home from school todav, and
for however mail) days, as she fears for
their safety as Muslims. She proceeds to
say she is an American — not even first
and foremost, but totally and completely
American. Just like you. J list like me.
After the brutal attack on Pearl I iarbor
in 1941, Americans reacted in an under
standable state of panic. Unfortunately,
this spurred a massive animosity towards
Japanese-Americans — citizens of this
great country — and inconceivable mea
sures were then taken. We imprisoned
our own people in our own form of con
centration camps merely for appearing
Asian, giving way to one of the ugliest,
most shameful moments in recent Ameri
can history.
Never in my life have I encountered a
person who finds this warranted, jutifiable
or forgivable, and 1 hope to God that I
never do. In retrospect, evtfn with the lives
so unnecessarily lost at Pearl Harbor still
in mind and memory, we all know forcing
innocent Japanese-Americans into inhu

mane camps was disgusting and wrong on
so many different levels.
Although internment camps seem ab
solute!) impossible in America toda\, vio
lent acts of hate against people, sadly, re
main common. Now, again in a most un
derstandable state of panic and fear, we
as Americans must make a most concert
ed effort to hinder any form of negative
backlash towards its American people of
Middle Kastern descent. We must not
create a trend that we as a people will un
doubtedly regret in years to come, just .is
we undoubtedly regret and abhor our
post-Pearl Harbor treatment of Japan
ese-Americans.
To attack your American neighbor for
merely looking Middle Kastern is the same
as attacking your Caucasian neighbor,
your black neighbor or your Jewish neigh
bor. There is no difference between us
American citizens. To attack one is to at
tack us all, just as in attacking the World
Trade Center, the Pentagon and the four
planes, the terrorists attacked us all. To
turn on your American brother is stupid.
It is counterproductive to the bond we
must now be solidifying.
And it is under this mentality that we
must collect our unspeakable anger, direct
all of our energies to those accountable,
and compile ;ill of our resources to unite as
one American agent against these savage
terrorists, these ruthless, murdering ene
mies. We cannot afford to splinter as a so
ciety; now, more than ever in our history,
we must form the strongest, most tin

breakable bond.
Hate your Middle Kastern-appearing
neighbor, and you give those terrorist bas
tards just what they want. You satisfy only
them. As a country, as a world, we do not
have energy to waste on innocent citizens
when iu the face of such evil. Please, in the
name of God, peace, love and all that is
just, true and right, keep your anger fo
cused on the enemy who deserves it.
I his is the 21st century, and racism and
bigotry have no place in this world that has
become so small. They are antiquated in
stitutions, speaking only to ignorance and
total misconception. We have lost too
many lives, paid too great a price and
fought too many battles in the name of
eliminating racism to regress so fast.
The reverberations of Sept. 11, 2001
have gone incredibly far. Please do not
allow the tragedy to spread even further.
Do your part to spread only messages of
love, concern and compassion to every last
citizen of America, no matter their creed,
color or religion.
Continue to pray for the families most
deeply affected by this tragedy, for the
lives lost, for the most courageous heroes
behind the rescue efforts, for every last cit
izen of this great nation and for the victo
