### MARC WAIS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Lasi week's horrors on the east
coast have It'll an indelible mark
on the American landscape that
all ol lis will have to come to
terms with in ourown panic nlai wa\. I his
proc ess is sure to he lengthy and cliHic nil.
Meanwhile, bright-evecl new students
are descending on the latin today to
begin theii Sianlord career. Mam will
likeh li ave mixed emotions as the\ tn to
make sense ol last week's events against
the bac k<lr<»i» ol beginning college, which

often is promoted as "the
best years ol vour life."
I he intellectual jour
ne\ that is about to begin
lor our new Stanford stu
dents will certainb pro
vide ample opportunit\
in and out ol the < lass
room to disc tiss, anal) ze
and relied upon Sept. 1 1

and its aftermath. I lie breadth and depth
ol Stanlot cl's c in rieulum, the expertise ol
its lacnlt\ ,ind the great diversits of out
cc)ininunit\ will serve students well in this
process. t

We encourage our students to establish
their niche at Stanford, to connect with
fac ult\ and lellow students and to develop
meaningful relationships that will nurture
and support them. We encourage them to
panic ipate in activities that bring tliein en
joyment and satisfaction and to pursue
their passions in life, both in and out of the
classroom. We undei stand that they will
need to be- able to unwind from the stress
brought on In academic demands, per
sonal issues, .uul local, regional, and now
we painfull) know, world events. We en
courage them to be carefree, to have fun
— even in these difficult times — and

not to feel guiltv about it.'
We remind our students that eliminat
ing or scvereU limiting the sheer fun and
jov ol the college years would not onl\ di
minish the overall Stanford experience,
but it would also provide an even greater
victor) to the terrorists w ho seek to change
our way ol life.
At Stanford we c herish many values,
among them trust, respect, honor, ci\ilit\
and integrity. Within this context, 1 trust
that out newest members of the Stanford
communit) will be respec tlul and thought
ful in processing the tragic events of last
week; will show respect for the dignity ol

eat h individual; will refrain from taking ac
tion against a person or group of people
based on a stereotype or because ol tlieii
religion or ethnic it\: and will take the time
and make the elfort to enjoy .ill that Stan
ford and the Hay Area have to oiler. I he
Stanford communih is sure to be enrit heel
l>\ the presence and future contributions
ol our newest citi/ens who reflet t the hope
and promise of a more peaceful, tolerant,
and understanding woi Id. Welcome to the
Farm, transfers and (llass of'os!
