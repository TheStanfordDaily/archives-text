# Terrorist attacks cast shadow over campus
## Stanford turns to faith as tolerance for Muslims is stressed 
### ANUJ GUPTA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Ten days after the* most devas
tating ads ol terrorism America
lias ever seen, the Stanford com
munity is gearing up to begin a
new yeai filled with challenges and
emotions that no one could have
predicted jusi weeks ago.
I he Sept. I I attacks — in
which hijackers seized control of
four I'.S. commercial jetliners,
crashed two into New York's
World Trade Center towers, one
into the Pentagon and one out
side Pittsburgh, l'a. — reduced
the I win lowers to rubble, lev
eled a majoi section of the na
tional militai \ headquarters and
may have claimed as many as
7,000 lives.
No University students, facul
t\ or staff are known to have been
killed or injured in the attacks.
Still, the incidents undeniabK
cast a pall over the campus last
week, resulting in a mood that
Dean for Religious Life Rev.
Scotty McLennan described as a
combination of "shock, grief,
confusion and fear."
But, as McLennan stressed, a
number of spiritual and commu
nal gatherings have helped indi
viduals on campus to emerge
from the crisis, just as the nation
has been galvanized by an un
precedented display of unity and
patriotism.
In the wake of the attacks, ad
ministrators, academic experts
and students are ac knowledging
that life at Stanford will change
irrevocably in many respects,
but most are expressing confi
dence tli.it the- upcoming year

will see the community remain
stable and strong.
Services bring Stanford together
Mc Lennan said that as soon as
he realized the magnitude of the
devastation last I uesday, he knew
there was going to be an immedi
ate outpouring of grief on campus
and an accompanying need for or
ganized prayer.
"1 moved quite quickly to get
ahold of inv colleagues in the ()f
-fice for Religious Life with the
knowledge that we needed to
gather the community at Stan
ford as quickly as possible,
\lc 1 .ennan s.iid.
I lie result was a noontime vigil
at Memorial Church that more
than 1,000 people attended.
McLennan, I niversitv President
John Henness\ and Vice Provost
for Campus Relations LaDoris
('.ordell were among those who ad
dressed t lie gathering.
"It is my prayer that this Stan

foul conimwniix will sot an example
for the test of the country In com
ing together in peace, in love and in
unity," ('.ordell said at the service.
Last Friday, McLennan orga
nized an even larger, interfaith
service in conjunction with Stan
ford Associated Religions. Facul
ty, staff and students converged
in front of the church for the
emotional ceremony, filling half
the Quad.
Fhe service, marked by song
and prayer from six different
faiths and punc mated by extended
periods of silence, coincided with
the National Day for l'rayei and
Remembrance ordered In Presi
dent Bush.
In an address at the interfaith
service, Hennessy called on the
Stanford community to "remem
ber and pray f<>r those that have
borne the cost of this terrible
tragedy — the innocent victims,
the families who have lost a loved
one and the friends who have lost

a comrade."
Quoting Abraham Lincoln's
second inaugural address in I HI if)
near the end of the C.ivil War,
I lennessx s.iid he hopes that cili
/ens ol Stanford and the nation
move forward, aiming "to .u hieve
.1 just and lasting peace among
ourselves and with .ill nations."
I late e-mails raise concern
Mennessv also sounded a (.ill
for tolerance and understanding

in his address, saving, "The color
of .i person's skin or his national
origin oi her religious beliefs do
not make them a terrorist or imply
that the\ harboi any sympathy for
the individuals that perpetrated
diis crime."
I lie remarks were in part a re
sponse to the threatening "hate e
tnails" that Islamic groups on cam
pus, including the Islamic: Society

President Bush has ordered that all U.S. flags, such as the one above in front
of the Bing Wing of Green Library, be flown at half mast to commemorate the
Sept. 1 1 attacks.
and the Muslim Simians Aware
ness Network, received in the days
following die atlai k.
\ccording to Naijes Misherghi,
(-lass of 2001, w ho served as presi
dent of both organizations while
she was ,i student, the e-mails con
tained racial epithets, obscene lan
guage and death threats.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Moore said that his department is
working with computer seem it \ of
ficials to investigate the e-mails.
" They're not easilv investigat
ed," Moore said. " The Internet
provides a lot of anonymity."
But Moore added that authori
ties have determined that the e
mails did not originate from anv
where within the Stanford system.
Hennessy swiftly condemned
the e-mails in a written statement
laM week, saving, " There is ab
solutelv no plate lor this kind ol be
havior in our community."
Mi Lennan said the dei ision to
begin hist Friday's set vice with a
Muslim (.ill to praver was in part
rooted 111 the organizers' recogni
tion that "it was important to
have a Muslim pravei prominent
in the service."
"We have a tremendous igno
rance in this country about Islam,"
Mi Tennan added. "It will be (liti
call\ important on this campus lot
us to begin to understand [Islam's]
tradition ol peace and its continuih
with other traditions tli.it people
know better, such .is C'.lnistianih
and Judaism."
Students voice personal horror,
anxiety about U.S. response
Several students recounted yen
personal stories about their con
nection to victims of the attacks.

Manhattan native Andy Ciustin
worked on the 93rd floor of One
World Trade, the first tower hit,
this summer.
The senior left his job in late Au
gust and was on vacation w hen he
heard the news.
"My first reaction was disbelief,"
he said, "1 thought it was a hoax.
But now that I 've had time to digest
it all, 1 just feel really sad."
(lustin worked for the invest
ment firm Fred Alger Management
and said that 40 of his former co
workers who were in the office at
the time of the attack remain unac
counted for.
"I can't even look at the cover of
1 mil' Magazine or any pictures of
the twin towers," he said. "I could
probably find mv (office] window
and that's just too intense."
" The mood in New York is ex
tremely somber," Ciustin added.
"People walk down the street with
their heads down, there are cops
e\ ei \ where, certain roads are still
closed."
Sophomore Arvel 1 lernandcz, .i
1 .ong Beach, ( alii., native who was
\isiting friends in New York state
during the strikes, said he shares
the feelings of many Americans.
"1 was really scared and afraid,"
lie-said, "but there was an over
whelming sense of community
everywhere 1 went."
Most students agree that
America should retaliate with ex
treme caution.
"Part of me wants America to
bomb even thing, but that's exactly
what I'm worried about," Ciustin
said. " The need for revenge is very
human, but blind, over-zealous re
taliation could just make an already
bail situation mm h worse."
Like Ciustin, junior Andrew
Baglino said he worries about the
iainiliiations of the attacks. "A pre
mature response could lead to a
world war that involves nuclear

weapons," lie said.
"Weshouldn't punish [an] entire
country lot the actions <>la small
and select lew." I lernandez added.
University business to
carry on cautiously
While virtually no one has been
left untouched In the attacks.
University ollicials are stressing
the importance of proceeding
with a smooth opening to the at a
demic year.
In an e-mail to .ill returning
students Wednesday, Hennessx
wrote that the year will start "as
planned and 011 schedule," hut
added, "Alternative plans and
support will he in place for all late
arriving students."
Hennessy's e-mail sounded an
optimistic note, as he indicated
that the return of students to Stan
ford will have a healing ellect fbi
.ill on campus.
"Despite the tragic events of re
ccnt davs, the entire campus com
munit\ lcw)ks lorwarcl to the sense
of renewal and enthusiasm that vou
bring with you," I lennessx told siu
dents. "We await voui arrival with
great antic ipation and hope.
Residential Feint at ion programs

according to Oirectoi ol Res Id
JaneCamarillo.
"()ur challenge this veai will In

Camarillo said ex pet is th.it

"We want to provide an oppor
tunity for students to share ilien
own personal experietn es and feel

ore hanged In the events," she said.
In addition to support from
residence staff, Hennessy
promised in his e-mail that stu
dents will be able to draw 011 coun
seling resources from the OHice
for Religious Life and Counseling
and I'syt hological Services.
Academic experts weigh in
I he terrorist strikes drew strong
reactions from several Stanford ex
perts ma number of fields.
Applied Physics and Biology
I Vol. Steven Bltxk, an expert on na
tional sec urity and terrorism, criti
cized the I .S.'s decision to instantiv
blame the attat k on alleged terror
ist mastermind Osama bin Litlen.
"I have no doubt that he is a ter
rorist . . . [antl| a danger to the
U. 5.." Block saitl. "But 1 have no
idea, antl I don't think anyone
knows for sure, that he was the one
behind these attacks.
"1 he I S. right now seems to be
lashing out at any terrorists they
can find."
I he inevitabh heightened set u
-1 it\ measures that are being put in
place nationwide in light of the .il
iac ks must be carefully implement
ed, Bloc k added.
"We have to make sure that we
don't abrogate our own civil rights
in an attempt to provide an illusory
sense of protection." Block said. "It
is ver\ hard to know what we
should t liange unless we know who
we .11 e c hanging things lor."
I'hilosophv Prof. Manuel Var
gas ec hot el Bloc k s concerns alioiit
the maintenance of American t ivil
liberties, and saitl he lears that the
American military response ma\
onl\ perpetuate the cycle ol 1111-
moralitN begun In the terrorists il 11
In ings about the death of more in
ntx ent ci\ilians.
"I worn that our desire for jus
tit e might spii al into .1 sequent e ol
othei injustices, whether through

an erosion of civil liberties or at
tacks on civilian populations in
other countries," Vargas said.
"It would be wrong for us to
achieve our vengeance in a way
that created .1 comparable horror
or that destroyed many ol the kinds
of things that we value most about
our own country."
Religious Studies Prof. Bernard
Faure said groups with political
goals often appropriate religious
ideas in a perilous fashion.
"Religious language is used to
justify political purposes, language
such as 'holy war' and 'crusade,' "
Faure said. "It's dangerous on ei
ther sitle. 1 Both | terrorists and gov
ernments use religious language to
justify political action."
Security comes into focus
As they have nationwide, the
attacks have prompted Universi
ty authorities to reexamine secu
rity procedures to ensure that
Stanford's people and buildings
are safe.
But Police (lliief Moore stressed
that there will not be visibly
ramped up security measures that
will ailed daily life or attessibilit\
on campus.
"Is there a heightened aware
ness, are we focusing more on ac
tivities that might be targeted?
Yes," Moore said. "But we're not
locking down the campus or
screening people who tome on
campus. 1 he freedom of move
ment is still the same here."
Still. Moore acknowledged that
the department will make a "con
certed eflbrt" to monitor certain
events that ma\ be targeted and
saicl plainclothes officers will be pre
sent at Islamic praver services on
Fridays, the international student
orientation at Bcchtcl International
('.enter this weekendandtheOpfn
ing( '.on vocation 111 the Quad today.
Also, Moore s.iid there \n ill have

to In- "much tighter security" at
high-profile sporting events on
campus, such as Stanford tootball
and basketball games.
"The Athletics Department is
going to restrict .1 lot of things com
ing into the stadium that they
would normally allow, [like] coolers
and backpacks," he said.
Lans attending Stanford events
should not anticipate having to step
through metal detectors anytime in
the neat future, Moore said.
"Metal detectors would be an
overreact ion," he said.
According to Moore, the bomb
tint ats that were t ailed in last week
to the Hoover Library and Stan
lord Hospital — which caused
each facilit\ to be evacuated —
were "not uncommon."
Authorities had been expecting
"copycat" incidents, and carried
out standard response procedures
to tlit* threats, Moore said.
'Wind of freedom blows'
In his address during the inter
laith service hist week, llennessv
summed up the I niversitv's phi
losopln toward the attacks In re
letting to the Stanford motto, se
le<ted !>\ the s<hool's first presi
dent, I)avid Start Jordan: " 1 lie
wind of freedom blows."
" I his motto am serve as an in
spiration lot eat h of us, as we strug
gle with questions about the mean
ing of our freedom, the cost of
maintaining a free society and what
sort of countn we want to live in,"
I lenness\ said.
" The horrendous events of this
week will, no doubt, change our
view s . . . |but | if we alter our com
mitment to a free and open stx iety,
we will have giv en these terrorists a
victors which the\ do not deserve."
