### ANUJ GUPTA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Ten days after the* most devas
tating ads ol terrorism America
lias ever seen, the Stanford com
munity is gearing up to begin a
new yeai filled with challenges and
emotions that no one could have
predicted jusi weeks ago.
I he Sept. I I attacks — in
which hijackers seized control of
four I'.S. commercial jetliners,
crashed two into New York's
World Trade Center towers, one
into the Pentagon and one out
side Pittsburgh, l'a. — reduced
the I win lowers to rubble, lev
eled a majoi section of the na
tional militai \ headquarters and
may have claimed as many as
7,000 lives.
No University students, facul
t\ or staff are known to have been
killed or injured in the attacks.
Still, the incidents undeniabK
cast a pall over the campus last
week, resulting in a mood that
Dean for Religious Life Rev.
Scotty McLennan described as a
combination of "shock, grief,
confusion and fear."
But, as McLennan stressed, a
number of spiritual and commu
nal gatherings have helped indi
viduals on campus to emerge
from the crisis, just as the nation
has been galvanized by an un
precedented display of unity and
patriotism.
In the wake of the attacks, ad
ministrators, academic experts
and students are ac knowledging
that life at Stanford will change
irrevocably in many respects,
but most are expressing confi
dence tli.it the- upcoming year

will see the community remain
stable and strong.
Services bring Stanford together
Mc Lennan said that as soon as
he realized the magnitude of the
devastation last I uesday, he knew
there was going to be an immedi
ate outpouring of grief on campus
and an accompanying need for or
ganized prayer.
"1 moved quite quickly to get
ahold of inv colleagues in the ()f
-fice for Religious Life with the
knowledge that we needed to
gather the community at Stan
ford as quickly as possible,
\lc 1 .ennan s.iid.
I lie result was a noontime vigil
at Memorial Church that more
than 1,000 people attended.
McLennan, I niversitv President
John Henness\ and Vice Provost
for Campus Relations LaDoris
('.ordell were among those who ad
dressed t lie gathering.
"It is my prayer that this Stan

foul conimwniix will sot an example
for the test of the country In com
ing together in peace, in love and in
unity," ('.ordell said at the service.
Last Friday, McLennan orga
nized an even larger, interfaith
service in conjunction with Stan
ford Associated Religions. Facul
ty, staff and students converged
in front of the church for the
emotional ceremony, filling half
the Quad.
Fhe service, marked by song
and prayer from six different
faiths and punc mated by extended
periods of silence, coincided with
the National Day for l'rayei and
Remembrance ordered In Presi
dent Bush.
In an address at the interfaith
service, Hennessy called on the
Stanford community to "remem
ber and pray f<>r those that have
borne the cost of this terrible
tragedy — the innocent victims,
the families who have lost a loved
one and the friends who have lost

a comrade."
Quoting Abraham Lincoln's
second inaugural address in I HI if)
near the end of the C.ivil War,
I lennessx s.iid he hopes that cili
/ens ol Stanford and the nation
move forward, aiming "to .u hieve
.1 just and lasting peace among
ourselves and with .ill nations."
I late e-mails raise concern
Mennessv also sounded a (.ill
for tolerance and understanding

in his address, saving, "The color
of .i person's skin or his national
origin oi her religious beliefs do
not make them a terrorist or imply
that the\ harboi any sympathy for
the individuals that perpetrated
diis crime."
