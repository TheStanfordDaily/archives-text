I his summer. Cregory Loew was named to
the position of deputx director of the intci na

Center. As deput\ director, Loew will work
with Director jonathan Dorian to coordinate
all operations at SL\(
Loew is trained as an accelerator plnsicist
and much of his job will deal with the design of
the accelerator. I his job will be especialb rele
vant to Loew's work, since he helped to design
manv of the parts in the accelerator.
In addition, Loew will assist with utilities at

the great research we have in our plans,"

" I lu se resources include affordable elec

Loew will also help Dorian work toget suffi

also to convince the governnu'iit to allocate
money for future projects in linancialh dillicnit
times. Securing funding is c rue ial bet a use pro

Kxamples of such projects include the de
sign of a collider that could be up to !i() km long.
"One ol the things I am responsible for is a
report in the next year that is supposed to sort
out the advantages and disadvantages of four
different approaches to the design of linear col
liders," Loew said.
During the next year, Loew also hopes to
keep several projects, including a H-fiicton col
lider (which involves dillerent amount s of mat
ter and anti-matter) and the linear accelerator
itself, running smoothly.
