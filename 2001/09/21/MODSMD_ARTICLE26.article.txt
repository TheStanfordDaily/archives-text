Q: I'm a lost and confused
freshman late for m\ Introduction
to the Humanities (lass — and
worse vet, it's raining. I'm too cool
for.m umbrella, so I'm going to
have to hoof it sans protection.
Will I get less wet running through
the rain, or walking?
A: Ah, freshmen. I'hey think
their questions are so simple. The
answer is more complicated than
intuition would suggest. You
might think you get less wet run
ning. since you're spending less
time in the rain. But then again, in
a given amount of time, you'll
move through more rain running
than walking. Do the two effects
cancel out? Is there a specific
speed which gives you a minimum
amount of exposure? And does
your head get wet in the same way
your body does?
For this question, Answer Girl
consulted Mathematics Prof. C Hark
Brav. We'll explain the math for
those techies, then illustrate the
answer with a more intuitive anal
ogy for the fu/./ies.
Let's start with an assumption:
The rain is falling straight down,
with no wind to blow the rain at an
angle. 1 lie next step is to change
the frame of reference to simplify
the math. Instead of the rain
falling down on a stationary pet
son. let's imagine this person is
moving up moving through a
batch of stationary rain droplets,
like a fog, as he walks forward.
I'he two situations are perfectly
equivalent. 1 lie velocity of the rain
droplets moving down now be
comes the vertical velocity of the
person moving up, represented by
the dashed arrow in Figure A. The
horizontal velocity of the person
moving along the ground is repre
sented In the dotted arrow. If we

combine the two velocities, we'll be
able to use just one arrow to repre
sent .ill of the movement in the s\ s
tem. I sing vector addition, we get
the resulting bolded arrow to rep
resent the new vector. (Figure A)
Now we need to simplify. When
you're on tl.ie move in the rain, you
get wet two ways: hither the rain
falls on your head, or it hits the
front of your body .is you move
through the droplets. I .et's consid-

er the front of your body first:
We'll treat you as a straight line,
with the length of the line equiva
lent to your height.
Now, here's win we fro/e du
nlin droplets: The amount of tain
you encounter will be direct 1\ re
lated to the area your bod\ covers
as you move through the rain.
Ihe more area you move
through, the mote droplets vou
run into. 1 herefbre, we need to
compare the areas you cover run
ning versus walking, and we'll
have our answer.
fo observe the area you trace,
we'll move your "line" forward .is
vou move along the diagonal vec
tor we previously worked out. 1 he
diagonal movement thus encom
passes both moving forward along
the ground and moving "up
through the rain. As you can see in
Figure B, you trace a parallelo
gram with the front of your body.
Now, il vou are tunning, the value
of your horizontal vector is in
creased (since you're moving
faster), and the resulting diagonal
vector is less steep since there is
more of a horizontal component to
it. If you walk, the horizontal vec
tor contributes less, and you have a
more vertical (steeper) diagonal
vector.
So, we ju>t need to calculate the
area covered bv your body ;is \ou
move forward, and we'll have the
total amount of rain encountered.
But here's the t üb: I lie area of a
parallelogram is equal to its base
(represented by how tall you are)
times its height (represented by
the total distance traveled). But the
distance traveled is the same either
way, as is your height, so the steep
ness of the parallelogram doesn't
matter. I he area is the same run
ning or walking, so the front ofyou

gels |iist as wet either wav.
So, wear a I»i 14 enough hat
(you'llprohahlv want to cover your
shoulders) and vou t an take your
lime and walk into Mil M late,
hut what il vou're hatless?
Now, instead of imagining the
person as a line, consider liim as a
flat rec tangle, w itli the base of the
re< tangle the "si/<- ol vour head.
As you move through the rain,
vou traie two pai allelograms: ()ne
represents the path traced In your
l)od\. as we <lis( ussed. and the sec
ond (shaded in Figure ( '.) repre
sents the path traced h\ vour head
as ii gets rained on from above.
And the areas are different.
I lus is hi t ause the base and height
are "sum bed.'' I he base now rcp
-1 esents the si/.e of the head (pretty
big .is .1 frosh, I assume) and that
obvioush si.i\s the same running
or walking, lint the height is no
longei the horizontal distance
traveled, 1 xit the vertical distance
traveled as you move "up"
through the stationary rain. So,
with more time to move "up"
through the rain when you walk,
the height of the parallelogram
will be longei. and the resulting
area of the parallelogram will be
increased.
()f'com se, this is intuitive: More
rain hits \«>111 head walking, since
vou're spending more time under
the rain.
For those not mathematically

inclined, here's a more intuitive
analogv: I liink of yourself hold
ing a bucket as you move through
the rain. If you run. you'll obvi
ousl\ collect less water than if vou
walk. But the front of the bucket
is going to get as wet either walk
ing or running. You're going to

encounter the same amount of
water droplets with am forward
movement, regardless of how fast
you choose to hit them, there
fore, the wetness of the front of
the bucket is a constant, and the
(juestion depends on how much
water the bucket collects.

So, the next time you're smck in
the rain, with no protection, tfo
with your instincts — run!

who urn gracious enough to explain (ill
this to me.
