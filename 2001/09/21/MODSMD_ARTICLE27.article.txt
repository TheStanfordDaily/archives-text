Solar flares explode near sunspots with the energy of a hundred million hydrogen bombs. Astronauts caught spacewalking during a solar flare or one
of their cousins, a coronal mass ejection, can absorb a radiation dose equivalent to 100 chest x-rays — reason enough to dash for shelter. Flares pose
little direct danger to Earth dwellers because our planet's atmosphere protects us from their deadly radiation. But unpredictable solar explosions do af
fect our lives. They can disable satellites, scramble aircraft navigation and interrupt high-frequency radio communications for hours.
