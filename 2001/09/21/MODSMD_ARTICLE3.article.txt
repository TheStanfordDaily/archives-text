# U.S. News rankings controversy escalates
## Stanford slides up to fifth as magazine comes under fire 
### WILL OREMUS FACTORIAL STAFF 
Stanford is now tlu % fifth-best
university in the country. Ii is a
better school than it was last year,
when it was sixth best. At least,
that's what the U.S. News and
World Report's annual college
rankings would have the public
believe.
I his year's edition of the high
ly influential and controversial
rankings, released by the weekly
newsmagazine each September,
gives Stanford an overall score of
95.0 on its rating scale, which
purports to measure the strength
of the academic program at each
undergraduate institution. That
places Stanford in a three-way tie

/
for fifth in ihe t;ilegor\ <>1 nation
al universities — doctoral, along
side the Massachusetts Institute
of I ethnology and the I niversity

Perched atop this year's list of
the best colleges is Princeton I Di
versity, which earned an overall
score of 100. (Hose behind are
Harvard University, Yale Uni
versity and the California Insti

"Last year we were sixth, this
year we're fifth," said Associate

Stanford is now tlu % fifth-best
university in the country. Ii is a
better school than it was last year,
when it was sixth best. At least,
that's what the U.S. News and
World Report's annual college
rankings would have the public
believe.
I his year's edition of the high
ly influential and controversial
rankings, released by the weekly
newsmagazine each September,
gives Stanford an overall score of
95.0 on its rating scale, which
purports to measure the strength
of the academic program at each
undergraduate institution. That
places Stanford in a three-way tie

/
for fifth in ihe t;ilegor\ <>1 nation
al universities — doctoral, along
side the Massachusetts Institute
of I ethnology and the I niversity
of Pennsylvania.
Perched atop this year's list of
the best colleges is Princeton I Di
versity, which earned an overall
score of 100. (Hose behind are
Harvard University, Yale Uni
versity and the California Insti
tute of Technology.
"Last year we were sixth, this
year we're fifth," said Associate
Director of University Communi
cations Kate Chesley. "Colleges
and universities don't change
much from year to year, so we
don't put much stock in move
ment within the rankings."
Dean of Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid Robin Mamlet said
