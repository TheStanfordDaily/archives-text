## Stanford starts fast behind new coach 
### EZRA CALLAHAN AMANDA CANEVARO STAFF WRITERS 
Beginning his first year on the
Farm, new Stanford women's
volleyball head coach John Dun
ning probabh expected to get
ha/ed in some traditional new*
man-on-catnpus style.
1 he Stanford athletic depart
ment tame up with just the right
sort of initiation ritual tor Dun
ning, too: they put No. Penn
State and No. 15 Minnesota on
the schedule during his first
week at t he head of the (lardinal
bench.
But Dunning persevered and
coached the Cardinal to six
straight victories, with four of
those wins coming against top
-2- ranked teams.
Most recently, the team de
feated No. 18 Ie x.is A&M to
claim the lexasA&M Invitation
al Championship, Saturday,
Sept. 8. Freshman ()gonna N tia
mani was named tournament
MVP, while teammates Robyn
Lewis and Logan lorn were all
tournament selections. The Car
dinal's ranking soared to No. 3,
up from its No. 10 preseason po
sition.
Stanford kicked off its 2001
season August HI at the Jefferson
Cup with matches against the
Golden Gophers of Minnesota
and tournament host Virginia.
1 he Cardinal closed out play at
the Cup Sept. 1 against Radford
before heading to State College,
Penn. to face the preseason Big
10 Conference-favorite Nittany
Lions on Tuesday.
"Plaving teams like Penn State

and Minnesota will show us early
what kind of character our team
has," said senior outside hitter
Michelle Chambers, one of the
Cardinal's two co-captains. "Our
goal is to prove as much as we
(.111 in the lew weeks before con
ference play."
1 he tough early season sched
ule answered a lot of lingering
questions surrounding the Car
dinal squad, which is looking to
bounce back from last year's dis
appointing 19-12 season.
The most obvious of those
questions might have been the
most important: who will take
(lie court for Stanford?
"With a new coach coining in,
ii gives everyone a chance to
prove themselves and show who
is best suited to be a starter and
represent Stanford on the
court," said Dunning.
l"he problem Dunning faced
in picking a lineup is enviable:
almost every player on the 14-
wonian roster has the talent to
start.
"Everyone plays hard every
day." Chambers said. "Everyone
(ontributes to the team, so we're
not too concerned about who is
out there at a given time."
But the trick for Dunning was
to find the six who could build
the sort of on-court chemistry
the Cardinal never found last
year on its way to a program-low
final ranking of 19th.
I hat was certainly no easy
task, as Stanford has depth at
every position. Outside hitter is
particularly crowded; seven
players were in contention for
