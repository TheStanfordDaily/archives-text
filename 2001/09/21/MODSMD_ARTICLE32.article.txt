# Pac-10 rivals are tougher than ever

### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
Every year the goal of Stan
ford's football season is a run for
the roses â€” a berth in the Rose
Bowl. This year is no exception,
yet the 2002 Rose Bowl will be On
stage for the national champi
onship game.
Due to the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's decision to join the Bowl
Championship Series, no Pac-10
team is guaranteed a spot in
Pasadena on Jan. 3. fhe onlv wa\
the nation will watch a Pac-10
school in"the granddadch of
them .ill" is il theconferenc e plan s
a team in the B( '.S top-two.
I hough the team returns 10
starters and is finally beginning to
reap the benefits of its recruiting
harvest, the (iardinal was shunned
by the preseason polls and pic ked
to finish no higher than fifth in the
Pac-10. Last year's 5-0 record is
likely a main reason tor Stanford's
absence in the polls, yet winning
percentage alone belies the fact
that the Cardinal placed fourth in
the nation's highest rated confer
ence in 2000 and that each of the
team's six losses were to bowl
bound teams.
"We need to realize what we
can become." said head coach I V
rone Willingham. "We need to re
alize how close we were last year to
having a sound and solid season. II
we can realize that and plav hun
grv every week, we have a < bailee
to be a good football team."
Stanford moved closer to that
designation during its Sept. 8
openei against Boston College.
Aftei .i rusty start in the opening
quarter, the Cardinal over
whelmed the F.agles with athleti
cism in a 38-22 win.
I he Stanford coaches have con
sistently cited the experienced of
fensive line as the Cardinal's
strength in 2001. and the big men

did not disappoint. Anchored by
senior right guard Eric I leitmann,
the line dominated scrimmage
and gave senior quarterback
Ranch 1-asani plent\ of time to air
it out.
1-asani has shown time and
again the al>ilit\ to mold a broken
play into a masterpiece. I le didn't
disappoint against the Eagles,
passing for four touchdowns, two
of them from out of the pocket
after evading numerous blitzing
BC defenders.
Willing!).tm has high hopes for
his leader, and both coach and
cpiai terbac k realize that five of t lie
last six Pac-10 champions had se
nior signal callers.
"Ranch li.is great size, great
athleticism, excellent speed,
strong <ti ill and a great mind, said
the seventh-year head coach.
"When vou put those characteris
tic s iii there, it becomes very clear.
You expect liini to perform at a
level .iiul believe that lie has the
abilit\ to be one of the best quar
terbacks in the Pac-10."
Stanford has the same kind of
talent and experience on the de
fensive side of the ball.
Seven defensive starters return,
including senior free s.ilet\ lank

for the |im 1 liorpe award, annual

ginia.
Yet the- tests for Stanford's grid
ders are just beginning. Starting
tomorrow they jump headfirst
into a Pac -10 pool that may be the
deepest in the nation. A year after
three Pac-10 schools finished in
the nation's top-10, the conference

shows no signs ol letting up, with

With last weekend's game against San Jose State postponed until Dec. 1,
Stanford has spent the week practicing against itself. The Cardinal next takes

"We love [the strong conter

of an underdog."
Stanford's next eight games ,iic
against l'ac-10 foes, and the post
ponement of last weekend's San

Cardinal will end the regulai se.i
