# Women's soccer faces stacked conference
## 
### ARISHA HATCH 
Packed with five teams in the
nation's top 20, this year's Pacif
ic 10 Conference leader will
have to kick more than goals:
it's going to have to kick some
major tail on the field if it wants
to emerge as the top team in the
nation's toughest conference.
1 his year's Cardinal is no

stranger to the challenges that
face it in this very competitive
league. Last year, despite end
ing the season ranked 20th in
the nation, Stanford only man
aged to kick its way towards a
disappointing fourth-place fin
ish in tlit' Pac-10. No doubt, this
season's Pac-10 champion will
serve as an explempory staple*
of that tired, old, sporting

(lithe: "In order to be the best,
you must play tlie best."
Needless to say, Stanford will
definitely get it's opportunity to
play against the best. However,
everything will have to fall into
place if the Cardinal wants to
have <1 shot at a conference title
and league nemesis UCLA.
Still, the national title is the
ultimate goal. To achieve that, a
team has to make it to the post
season. And, if Stanford wants
to advance to the postseason for
the I Ith time in 12 years, it has
to establish a serious national
reputation.
To do that, second-year
Head Coach Andy Nelson lias
put together a tough non-con
ference schedule to challenge
the team.
"We will learn a lot the first
few weeks of the season," Nel
son said.
"Our non-conference games
will prepare us very well for the
Pac-10 and the NCAA Tourna
ment. There are no easy games
on our schedule," said Nelson.
So far, the Cardinal (3-0) has
risen to its coach's expectations,
winning its season opener
against Florida on Sept. 2.
Down 2-0 at halftime, Stanford
scrambled iu the second half.

After junior Man ia Wallis
closed the gap with a go.il in the
51st minute, junior Callic With

goals to lead the Cardinal in an
upset over the lOth-ranked Ag

finished off a successful road
trip with a double-overtime vic
tory over No. 17 Texas. Wallis
scored her third goal of the year
to tie the game at one in the
711i minute. After a defensive
stalemate pushed the game into
extra time, sophomore forward
Marcie Ward finished off the
Longhorns early into the sec
ond overtime with her second
goal of t he year.

A deep Pac-10 Conference will challenge junior Callie Withers and the Car
dinal, which has begun the season with a strong 3-0 record, all on the road.
Two of the victories came in overtime after the Cardinal trailed in regulation.
