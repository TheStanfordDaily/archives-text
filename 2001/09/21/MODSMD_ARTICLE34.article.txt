# Well-balanced field hockey squad looks to build off of road adversity
## Roadtrip through heartland brings the Cardinal together for a run at the postseason 
### JONATHAN STULL EDITORIAL STAFF 
When Cardinal head coach Sheryl
Johnson scheduled Stanford's preseason
road trip, she hoped it would bring the
team together. 1 lowever, she had no idea
what kind of adversity they'd overcome.
Stanford field hockey's two-plus-day
drive home from Oxford, Ohio, didn't
set any records last week. Thousands

were forced to drive across country with
air travel shut down. But not many other
people had to spend all those hours sit
ting and eating and sleeping next to a pile
of stinky, sweaty, smoldering goalkeep
ers' outfits.
"They were real troopers," said the 17-
year head coach. "They stayed together
and kept going."
Sure, the long ride home wasn't more
than an inconvenience. But, coming to
gether emotionally as a team to play a
game just hours after watching a nation
al tragedy unfold on screen can have a
positive effect on team unity.
According to Johnson, the Athletic Di
rector at Ball State University went to the

team's hotel on the morning of Sept. I I
to tell her that the decision to play the
game that afternoon was up to the two
coaches. Johnson talked with the head
coach at Ball State and they decided to
play the game.
"Our basic thoughts were that we need
to keep going," she said. "It's kind of like
not playing would be giving in."
So, Stanford played. While Stanford
(4-6-0) lost to the Cardinals, 1-0, it per
formed at a very high level, even rivaling
the effort it put forth in its August SI
upset of No. (> Michigan State.
"We stayed together and played one of
our best games," said senior co-captain
Erica Swesey. "We played so well, almost

as good as against Michigan State."
Two days later, against Miami (Ohio),
the team ran into more difficulties. When
no one factored in the time change from
Indiana to Ohio, the team ended up eat
ing only an hour and a half before game
time. When the team finally made its way
to the field, it had only a half hour to
warm up.
It didn't matter. The Cardinal came
out smoking, finishing off a 4-0 victory
over the Redhawks.
"It was all about adjustment," Swesey
said. "It was a perfect example of what
[coach] is always talking about. There's
always something new."
While the Stanford team lias an abun

dance of heart, its good pla\ wasn't all the
result of a steeh resolve. I lie Cardinal's
got talent, too.
Perennially one of the top teams on
the West Coast and a usual participant in
the NCAA Tournament, Stanford has
fashioned one of its most well-balanc:ed
squads this season. While Michelle Scott,
Class of 2001, was a star lor the Cardinal,
her presence often allowed other players
to wait around lot her to do something
great.
"We don't have any superstars," Swe
sey said. "We're .til consistent and the
level of play is a lot higher."
