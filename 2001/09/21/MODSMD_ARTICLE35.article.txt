# High playoff hopes ride on new coach for men's soccer team
## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Logic would tell us that a
team would be hurt by the loss of
an impressive core of senior
starters, which had a cumulative
record of 61-17-8 and included
the 2000 Player of the Year.
However, this year's men's
soccer team is looking to defy
this logic and possibly surpass
the performance of 1998,
when a team including this
squad's seniors made a run
through the NCAA tourna
ment and into the all-impor
tant Championship match.
I his hope rides on the shoul
ders of one of the teams' new re
cruits: head coach Bret Simon,,
who is joining the team after a six
year head coaching stint at
Creighton University in Nebras
ka.
Simon replaces Bobby Clark,
who accumulated a 71-21-12

(.703) record during five years
with the Cardinal. Clark is now
coaching at Notre Dame.
"Simon and Clark differ
mostly in the style and way that
we play. Simon is more offen
sive-minded and puts a lot of
emphasis on possession and
keeping the ball," said senior co
captain and Ail-American con
tender Lee Morrison.
Simon's winning ways haven't
changed here on the Farm, as
the Cardinal has been ranked
from sixth to third in early sea
son polls (depending on the
source) and has jumped off to a
great start with a 4-0 record.
1 his includes wins over Con
/aga, 3-0, Portland, 1-0, Loyola
Mary mount, 1-0 and Cal State
Kullerton 3-1.
"1 inherited a really good
team and am certainly not start
ing from scratch," Simon said.
"We're very self-disciplined and
in good shape, which allows us

to work on the nuances of the
game instead of having to lot us
on inspiration and fitness."
Simon will be looking to lead
the Cardinal to its fifth-straight
NCAA tournament appearance.
While the team is a member
of the Pacific-10 Conference, the
league has only five teams in
men's soccer: California, Ore
gon State, Stanford, UCLA and
Washington. According to
NCAA rules, a conference must
contain six schools for the cham
pion to receive an automatic bid
to the 48-team tournament.
Therefore, to move on to post
season and make a run at the
championships in Columbus,
Ohio, the team will have to re
ceive an at-large bid.
Due to the losses of last sea
son, the team is sporting a new
look not only on the sideline,
but also on the field.
"There are lots of new faces
in the starting lineup and peo

pie are at new places," Simon
said. "We're still developing a
style and gelling as a team. The
team is getting better rapidly,
and people are starting to learn
their new roles."
Stepping up to fill tlu- gap
left by last year's graduated se
nior class will be the team's
three captains: sophomore
midfielder Abe Ceiger, senior
midfielder Derek Shanahan
and Morrison, a defender.
While the squad did lose a lot
of experience and talent, it was
able to keep virtually the entire
defensive unit intact, as three of
the four starters are back. Last

year, the Cardinal defense was
the most impenetrable defense
in the nation. Leading the
group are Morrison and junior
Todd Dunivant. I he unit in
cludes not only a couple of AU-
Pac-10 players but also a few All-
Americans.
"Right now I would say that
our defense is ahead of the of
fense, partially because the de
fense has more returning play
ers. This allows us to spend
more time working 011 our at
tack and 011 ways to score more
goals," Simon said.
The last line of defense for
1 lie Cardinal are goalies Andrew

Terris, a junior, and freshman
Robby Fulton, who were both
back-ups for star goalie Adam
Xapala last season, lhese are no
easy shoes to till, as Xapala had
1(> shutouts, 54 saves and a 0.45
goals scored against average last
season.
"They are two of the best
goalkeepers, and despite not
having lots of experience they
have already showed that they
can step up In only allowing one
goal so far this season," Simon
said.
The squad currently has six

" I hey are in the mix and
doing really well. I hey have a

Simon said.

"We are doing really well
and are extremely deep. We
have a ton of good players at a
lot of spots," Morrison said.
"We have a good tore of se
niors, a strong desire and the
talent."
