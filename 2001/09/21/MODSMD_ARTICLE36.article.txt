New faces will not just be on the field for
the Stanford men's soccer team this year.
The squad also has a new coaching staff, in
cluding head coach Bret Simon.
Simon moves to The Farm from
Creighton University in Nebraska, where he
was an assistant coach for two years before
his six-year stint as the Bluejays' head coach.
If he is as successful at Stanford as he was
at Creighton, the Cardinal will be in good
shape. In his six years as head coach, Simon
had an impressive 96-26-9 record (.7(57).
Last season under Simon, Creighton had
its most successful team in the school's his
tory, finishing as the NCAA runner-up.
More impressively, this was the first NCAA
Finals appearance for any Creighton team in
any sport. In NCAA tournament play,
Creighton is 9-6 under Simon.
Simon replaces Clark, who left the Cardi
nal for South Bend, Ind., to be the new

Fighting Irish
head coach.
"It was par
tially the repu
tation of the
school that
drew me to
Stanford,"
said Simon,
who graduat
ed from the
University of
Massachusetts
at Amherst in
1980. "As
more and
more players

now have the opportunity and the decision
to play professionally, this is the kind of

place that attracts those play
ers. I'd been out to Stanford
before and even played
against Stanford, so I was fait
