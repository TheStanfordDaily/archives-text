Stanford always gets a lot of press about its wonderful st udent
athletes. S< mie is warranted, much is only relatively inspiring. As
in, relative to (anriunati's zero percent graduati< >n rate for men's
basketball, Stanford is amazing.
hut Mark Anderson might in: the real deal. Sure, the freshman
football player isn't the first stellar Stanford athlete to double .is a
smart guy. Nonetheless, hi* accomplishments are more than im
pressive.
1 lis football credentials alone would be enough to merit atten
tion. The 2000 Super Prep National Player of the Year was a ( 011-
sensus 112 irst leant Afl-American as both a defensive end and a
tight end. Everyone wanted him: Stanford joined Washington,
()regon State, lowa, Notre I)anie and 17 oilier s( hools in offering
scholarships.
hut what he wanted was just as important.
"The academics ( were) a big deal lor me," s.iid Anderson, "hut
I really wanted a good team, too. 1 liked Stanford's team atmos
phere. how goal-oriented the\ .ill are. I hat was important.''
C .o;tls are obviously a big deal fora gu\ who helped guide bis
Science howl team to the National Finals in Washington, l)(",
(luring bis junior year.
"|S< ience howl| got prett\ intense," he s;iid. "It was as mental
ly stressful as am football game."
While the academic side of things will begin soon enough, An
derson, who said he is a possible Karth Systems major, will have

to wait a while to get on the
field.
A week ago, Anderson had
surgery on his right knee for
patella tendonosis. I Ins week,
he goes into surgery on his left
knee.
"It's almost a blessing in dis
guise." he said. "They've both
bothered me fora while and
tbis'll get it out of the way be
fore 1 start playing."
I he time off should also give
Anderson a while to adjust to
the new surroundings. Palo
Alto is just ,i bit dillerent from
bis home of Lewistown, Mont.

"The atmosphere is completely opposite," Anderson said.
"| Lew istown'sfa sin.ill town in a valle\ surroundingbv live moun
tain ranges."
While this might sound like another case of a big fish in a small
pond, consider this: Anderson isa 0-foot-7, 200-pound giant.
So, whether lie makes it on the field or in the lab, Anderson will
remain .i presente on (anipus for the next few years.
