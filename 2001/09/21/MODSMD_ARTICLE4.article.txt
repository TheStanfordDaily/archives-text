# Indelible memories of a "JFK Moment" for a new generation
## 
### 
Editors not?: Numerous ob
servers have called the Sept. II
terrorist attacks, which destroyed
the World Trade Center towers in
Neiv York, severely damaged the
Pentagon and killed thousands,
the present generation's 'J IK Mo
ment": no one urill ever forget hou)
they found out the stunning news
and what thoughts and emotions
ran through their mind.
I he I )aiJ\ posed these questions
to sex>eral sources on campus over
the past week, and we present the
following compilation of the most
memorable responses, in their oxen
words.
Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo
Some background: my
mother is Japanese and im
migrated to this country in
the early 19505. She was a
teenager living in Nagano
when Hiroshima and Na
gasaki were bombed. Her
fear of genocide by the
Americans ran deep as a
child due to the propaganda
of the Japanese government.
But some of the fear was
well-founded. In 1941, Pearl
I larbor resulted in the loss of
approximately 2,400 Ameri
cans. Ihe American retalia
tion four years later resulted
in the loss of 240,000 civilians
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and coundess thousands in ra
diation or other health-relat
ed fatalities attributable to the
bombing.
Asa young adult in\ mother met
my father, a Mexican-American
from lexas in Japan during the
Korean War. I'hc\ mat tied and
came to the I nited States ...
I grew up during the civil rights
movement. I was six vears old when
JTK was assassinated, the same age
as Caroline Kenned) .. .and count
less others died at that time lor being
black or lighting lor equal rights.
Even as a child, I knew there ex
isted .in evil inlluence or a kind of
insanitv in humans that could result
in such acts of inhumanity ...
List Tuesday morning. I woke
to my dock radio at 6:30 a.m. I lie
President was on the air and was
saying that we had just experienced
a national tragedy.
I turned on the television to see
the images of the President in Mori
da and tlie World hade ( enter on
fire. Shortly afterward, the on-air
reporter who happened to be in
D C. was saving that he had just felt
an explosion.
l he third plane had gone down
on the Pentagon and 1 stared in dis
belief as the second tower hit began
to collapse. I felt the unknown fear
from my childhood remembering a
day as a child when my mother said
that we needed to be prepared to
leave our home at any minute but
was unclear of the reason why. She
had packed a trunk with some of

our belongings in the living
room ...
1 have only had moments since
then to really think about my own
feelings and most of that delay is in
tentional. My fear has turned to
sadness that perhaps we have not
prepared your generation to live
with fear and yet have hope.
Many of your peers have suf
fered great tragedies but it seems in
the United States there are mam
more who have never experienced
the kind of adversity that is brought
on by events like these ...
As each group of students ar
rives on campus, I breathe a little
easier and find honest joy that they
made it bat k safely. But my fear of
the future actions of our govern
ment and mv sadness of this new
exposure to your generation are
the emotions that I feel in the early
hours of the morning.

I was having breakfast in my
house here on campus. My wife
turned on the television, broke
into tears and called me into the
room.
We watched the pictures of the
towers going down and shared our
own immediate grief and shock. I
moved quite quickly to get a hold of
my colleages in the Office for Reli
gious Life with the knowledge that
we needed to gather the communi
ty at Stanford as quickly as posisble.
By noon, we had over 1,000 peo
ple [at a vigil in Memorial Church],

My thoughts were (ertainh that
this is unthinkable, .i hoi rot be
yond imagination. |l was| just
imagining .ill the people in th.it
building that were bcingi i uslied to
death as it went down, imagining
this kind ofterroi ism u here people
would take innocent civilians on .t
commercial aii line .uul turn n into
a weapon.
There was just this unprece
dented horror ol man's inhumani
ty to man ... the sense that our
world was changed Ibrever
America seemed to be undei at
tack, we didn't know at that point
how much more was to come.
Applied Physics Prof, and
terrorism expert Steven Block
I was brushing mv teeth and m\
wife came running down the stairs
to tell me the news. She had been
listening to the radio, but we turned
on the television.
I came to work anil was immedi
ately contacted by the Stanford
News Service, who informed me
that I was giving a press conference
that afternoon. It was mv first press
conference ever.
Graduate student Aijang Hassibi,
2000-01 Persian Student
Assoc. president
I was at my office here at Stan
ford, and I heard the news from
one of the students.
At that time, I was hoping that
few people [had been] killed, and I
was thinking, "Who they arc going
to blame this time?"

Senior Nick Larson
I was at home asleep. Mv dad
woke me up and told me what
happened, and I looked at him
.iiul 1 didn't believe him.
I was actually almost prepared
to go hack to sleep because, even
though I didn't think that he was
kidding. I simply did not believe
what he said.
I Ic said it again and I looked at
him, and he went back to the TV. I
up and followed him to the liv
ing room and started watching lor
about 10 minutes. I didn't say a
word.
Kinallv when i realized w hat had
happen, i felt just completely
ama/ed . . . stunned and sad
dened. and just continued to watch
coverage of it for the rest of the day.
Junior Jen Erdrich
I have been in Nepal working
on .i project since the attacks. Peo
ple in Nepal are very sad.
l'hey show a lot of sympathy,
and I think they relate because of
the tragedy that hit the royal fami
ly not so long ago.
I think their reaction is different
than Americans' and maybe else
where. 'l'hey don't show anger, just
sadness, sinc ere sadness. My friend
told me sometimes she weeps ...
Some [here] worry and hang on
every word of the news we get. It's
pretty scary no matter where you
are.
