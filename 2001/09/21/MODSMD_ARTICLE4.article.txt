Some background: my
mother is Japanese and im
migrated to this country in
the early 19505. She was a
teenager living in Nagano
when Hiroshima and Na
gasaki were bombed. Her
fear of genocide by the
Americans ran deep as a
child due to the propaganda
of the Japanese government.
But some of the fear was
well-founded. In 1941, Pearl
I larbor resulted in the loss of
approximately 2,400 Ameri
cans. Ihe American retalia
tion four years later resulted
in the loss of 240,000 civilians
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and coundess thousands in ra
diation or other health-relat
ed fatalities attributable to the
bombing.
