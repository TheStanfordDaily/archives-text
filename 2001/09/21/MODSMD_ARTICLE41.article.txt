Buena 11 igh School's loss on the soccer field
is Stanford's gain this season as the Cardinal
women's soccer team welcomes top recruit?
and high school teammates Natalie Sanderson
and Lisa Engel to the squad.
Both natives of Ventura, Calif., Sanderson
and Engel have been playing together since
Under-10 AYSO soccer, all the way through to
captaining last year's undefeated season and
suite championship performance with Buena
High School.
"Ilie decisions to come to Stanford and turn
eight years of playing together into 12 is most
ly coincidental, according to Sanderson and
Engel, but comes as a welcome surprise.
"I committed first." Sanderson said. "I real
ly liked the balance of academics and athletics
and the focus on the student-athlete. Plus my
sister, dad and aunt all came here, so my fami
ly was pushing towards Stanford. 1 didn't ex
pect 1 isa to end up here t<x>."
Engel did not have the family lineage like
Sanderson, whose father played for the
Stanford football team that won the Rose
Bowl in 1971 and 1972, but says she too was
eventually won over by the academics and
the opportunity to become a better soccer
player at Stanford.
"There are good and bad things about us

both coming here," Engel said. "We are really
good friends, and right now it's nice to always
have someone to talk to and hang out wit h, but
we know each other so well that it's hard to
spread out."
"It's good for freshmen to know someone
straight away." head coach Andy Nelson said.
"It makes the transition to college easier. It's al
ways nice to have that type of friendship and
understanding on and off the field."
.Along with bringing the experience of play
ing together, the talented duo also brings play
ing experience that extends to the national
level. Both were members of the Region IV
Olympic Development Team, and Sanderson
is in the player pool for the U-19 U.S. Women's
National Team.
Sanderson, the all-time leading scorer at
Buena High with 130 career goals, comes to
the Farm after a dominating performance as
striker her senior season, during which she
swept the 2000 Parade Magazine All-American
Player of die Year, 2(XX) Gatorade California
Suite Player of the Year, 2000-2001 1A Times
Player of the Year and 1999-2001 Ventura
Star Player of the Year.
Engel, a midfielder, earned Scholar Athlete
of the Region IV Olympic Development Team
in 2001 along with being named to the 2001

Los Angeles
Times All-
Region First
Team and
1999-2001
First Team
All-Channel
league.
"[Sander
son and
Engel] are
two great
additions to
the squad,"
Nelson said.
"They are

going to be two very handy players over die
next four years. Natalie is just back from ACL
surgery so she has a litUe ways to go before
she'll be ready to play. Lisa has adapted well to
a very competitive environment."
"I love ii so far," said Engel of her new
squad. "1 love the competitiveness of the team
and the people are great on and off the field.
I'm looking forward to enjoying myself as a
freshman and of course our team goal is to win
die NCAAs."
