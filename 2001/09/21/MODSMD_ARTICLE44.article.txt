## Hudnut remains sidelined; Azevedoy offense look to pick up slack in title race 
### AARON LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I lie silver anniversary of Dante
Dettamanti coaching the men's
water polo team would best be ac
companied by a little gold.
A golden ring, that is.
And given the unparalleled suc
cess lie has had the past 24 years at
the helm of the Cardinal, a National
Championship seems to be the only
wa) to give Dettamanti an appropri
ate goodbye as well. I he 58-year-old
( oat h, who has led Stanford to seven
NCAA championships and six run
ner-up finishes, will leave .11 the end
of the season to become an assistant
coach 011 the I S. National I cam
that will play in the 2001 Olympics
in Athens,
Therefore, the proper farewell
must come on 1 )ec embei 2 .it the na

"I think we have a < ha nee to win it
and I certainly would lo\e to go out
with a national < hampionship," said
Dettamanti, who has tallied a .788
winning percentage with a 549-1 17-
(i record at Stanford.
Although questions still linger
from a 14-IS record and a No. (>
final nation.tl ranking a veai ago,
improvements to this years team
should make last year's mediocre
finish seem like a mere blemish on
the remarkable resume ol Detta
manti.
With a current No. I ranking and
the addition ol redshirt freshman

Tony A/evedo, who took last year off
to play on the U.S. Olympic Team in
Sydney, the Cardinal looks primed
to overcome a somewhat disappoint
ing 2000 campaign.
A/eveclo, who scored a team lead
ing four goals in an opening 11-3
victory over UC-Davis at the begin
ning of the month, is possibly the
most heralded water polo player in
Stanford's history.
"It's nice to have Tony back, and
it makes a big difference. But one
guy can't win it for you and he's not
going to do it all by himself," Detta
manti said.
Besides A/evedo, the Cardinal
will rely on junior All-Americans
I'eter lludnut and goalkeeper Nick
I-llis. Hudnut, who led Stanford in
scoring with 44 goals last season, is
currently recovering from summer
shoulder surgery and has not com
peted in a match in 10 months.
"\lv shoulder is coming around
alright, but it's kind of frustrating
getting back into it," said Hudnut,
who lias been scrimmaging iti prac -
tice fora week and will probably be
back in action in two to three weeks.
In the meantime, A/evedo, along
with senior hole man Mark Amott
.mil juniors Jeff Nesmith. Brian Dar
row, Jeff Cuyman and Nathan All
dredge, will have to carry the load.
I he absence of Hudnut will also
give redshirt freshman Creg Crum
and sophomore Mike Dersc a
chance to display the experience
the\ gained from playing on the
I S. Junior National leam in the
World Championships in Turkey
this summer.
Maturity will be of added impor
tance for the Cardinal since last year
there was only one senior out of 21
players on the roster. That lac k of

experience pla\ed .1 significant role
in keeping Stanford 0111 <>! 1 lie Final

This year, Stanford carries 12 up

Sophomore Jaison Robinson
rounds out .1 team that should not
have 111111 h trouble earning a shot at
giving Dettamanti the gilt the leg
endary coach trill) deserves.
According to the 2">-year head
coach, however, simpl\ earning a
berth into the Final Four is harder
than winning the national champi
