## 
### JONATHAN STULL EDITORIAL STAFF 
UC-ll vine is ranked seventh in the most recent
I SA water polo poll. I hat sounds good. It sounds re
ally good.
But then one looks .it the MI'S 1- standings and

compares. I he Anteaters are also seventh in those
rankings.
So compared to I.a Verne (who?), tanked No. 20 in
the same national poll. 1(1 (0-1) is good. ( Compared
to the rest of its league, including No. I Stanford, it's
not that good.
I his points out two things.

One, the MPSF is stacked. All nine of the MI'SK
teams are in the top 10. No one outside of the
league has won the NCAA (Championship since (iod
knows when.
I wo, U( .1 should pose little problem lor the (cardi
nal in its matt hup.it the Avery Aquat it ('.enter Sunday.
1 ike old-time college football, when the old teams

just stacked up oil the best players, giving ;mv pre
tenders to tlie throne absolutely no chaine for promi
nent national success, water polo belongs to the top.
And this year, the top is Stanford.
The Anteaters' match against I CIA Sept. 8 is ,i
perfect example. I (II went into its man li against the
brums ranked sixth. I bird-ranked 1(1 A made it ob
vious that there was a big dillerenc e between their rel
atively close rankings.
In the first 19 minutes and 50 seconds ol the
game, the Anteatei s were held scoreless the bin
ins racked up an H-0 lead in the season opener foi
both teams. I'CI A then c ruised towards an e.is\ 12-
2 victory. UCI onlv had six shots on goal through
the first three periods.
Stanford, which gave a similar I 1-!J lic king to uii
ranked UC-I)avis Sept. 8, should be lic king it> c hops.
Redshirt freshman I ony A/evedo, Iresli oil lead
ing the I .S. national team into the 2000 C )l\ mpic sin
Sydney, scored lour goals against I ('.-Davis, junioi
Brian Harrow and senior Mark Ainott added two
goals of their own in the rout over the Aggies.
1(1 A junior goalie Brandon Brooks made 1 i
s.nes against the Anteaters. Stan lord's redshirt junioi
goalie Nic k Kllis should be similarly successful. F.llis
was a first-team All Americ an .is a freshman in 199 ( J
and a second-team selection last season.
II any Anteaters threaten the goal, ii will likek be
seniors John Dorii or Chris kiichwelun.
Dorli, UCl's third-leading scorer the past two sea
sons, scored HI goals in 2000 and 27 in 1909.
Kiic hwelun is the Anteaters' second-highest re
turning scorer. He notched 12 goals as a junior last
season, including two important scores in an I 1-7 win
over I C-San 1 )iego.
Stanford will again be without the sen ices of junioi
Ail-American I'eter lludnut.
Hudnut, who led the Cardinal in scoring last sea
son with 14 goals, is st hedulcd to compete again in an
other two or three weeks after completing recoven
liom a summer should surgery. When lludnut ic
turns, it will be his first match action in nearly 1(1
months.
