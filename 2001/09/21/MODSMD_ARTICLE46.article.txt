Water polo player Tony Azevedo had it rough as a freshman last year. 1 le
didn't arrive with the rest ofStanford's incoming freshman class, he wasn't able
to attend any of those cool summer book reading discussions, and, even worse,
he didn't have the chance to read the Orientation issue of the Daily.
Life sucked, and it was all because of those darned Olympic games in Syd
ney, Australia.
At 19, Azevedo was the youngest member <>112 the 2(M)() water polo contingent
from the United States to compete last fall.
That's right Azevedo was, and is, that good.
And he hasn't only proven his worth under the Olympic spotlight, but has
also sh< >wn his superior abilities as the leading scorer on the U.S. Nat ional team
in Japan this past summer and by scoring a team-leading four goals in his first
game for the Cardinal.
Alter redshirting last year, Azevedo might hold the key to a national champi
onship this year.
"He's definitely going to be a threat this year," said men's water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti. "He makes a big difference. Everyone will concentrate on
stopping him, and the problem if you're the other team is that if you double
team him, he's still going to get open and score."
But despite his superior skills in the pool, most students making their way
to Stanford for the 112 irst time still have something in common with the less-than
ordinary (Cardinal athlete, and it might start with the freshman experience —

one that Azevedo said he will never forget.
Imagine walking into a dorm, knowing
no one, thinking you had no similarities to
everyone else. Odds are it happened a few
hundred times today.
That was Tony Azevedo, too. Azevedo
was a resident of Okada, the Asian-Ameri
can theme house irt Wilbur, and originally
nervous about unfamiliar surroundings.
"At first, 1 got there and I was like 'Oh my
gtxl, I don't know anybody, I'm in a theme
house, " Azevedo said. "But it turned out to
be awesome and I met so many people and
a lot of guys I ended keeping up with over
the summer."
I.iken Azevedo's experience to the one all
freshmen are likely to endure over die next

year.
"1 made so many friendships," he said. "I originally thought I'd maybe stick
with just die water polo guys, but I ended up making friends with people who
didn't play sports, it was so much fun."
