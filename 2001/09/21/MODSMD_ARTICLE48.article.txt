Greetings from cheery resident as
sistants. Helping hands from smiling
Orientation Volunteers and introduc
tions to 100 new light-hearted faces.
Stanford seems like a pretty secure
place to many new students.
In making the transition to campus
life, however, freshmen often become
overly trusting and rather careless dur
ing their first few days on the Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a study a
few years ago of 58 st hools called "(-rime
at College: The Student (iuide to Public
Safety," Stanford was ranked one of the
15 safest campuses in the nation.
But don't be fooled. Crime does
occur here on the Farm â€” and the at

mosphere of Orientation can be the
ideal time for crooks to strike.
In most cases, however, simple pre
cautionary measures can help stop a
theft from ruining a good first year.
Lock that bike
For the past decade and a half, the
number one reported crime on cam
pus has been bicycle theft.
Bike theft soared as high as 800
bikes a year in the early- to mid-1090s.
However, the number has droped in
recent years due to SI million pro
ject devoted to improving facilities for
bicyclists.
In 1008. nearly 400 bicycles were
stolen. Iwo hundred thirteen were
stolen in 1007.
Since 1995, Stanford's bicycle pro
gram has created enclosures for 550

bikes and installed or upgraded 3,000
bike rack spaces, according to the Stan
ford Report.
In addition to creating new spaces,
the program has also freed up existing
spates by cracking down on aban
doned bikes.
Stanford police speculate that the
actual number of thefts is twice the re
ported number because many stu
dents do not bother to report their
stolen bikes.
I o avoid becoming one of the many
unfortunate victims, the police advise
students to lock up their bikes. Al
though U-locks are the most effective
locking devices, Stanford police also
recommend a safety device known as
"Bad Bones," which spans the length of
the lock and can make it five times
stronger.

In recent years, the Stanford police
have worked to be more visible and
catch more bike thieves. Police stress
the necessity of registering bikes. As
Stanford Police ('apt. Kaoul Niemeyer
told I he Daily in 1998, "without a vic
tim, we can't prosecute [a thief]."
Dorm safety
Ideally, dorm residences should be
locked up after midnight. This is usual
ly not the case, however, since students
go in and out of their dorms well after
that time. Many choose to prop the
door open as they make their early
morning rounds.
According to recent studies, bur
glars do not usually try their liu kin the
dorms after midnight. Instead, main
