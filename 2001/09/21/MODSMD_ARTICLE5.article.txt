# Construction giving Farm a new look
## Wilbur Dining Hall, new student health center among major projects underway 
### CAROLYN LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Year in and year out, summer at Stanford
sees flurries of summer-camp kids, student re
searchers. conference-goers and, inevitably,
construction.
Demolition trucks, towering cranes and
bright orange hard hats mingle with bicyc lists
speeding off to summer-session classes, while
drivers in search of parking spaces weave
slowly past yellow detour signs.
I bis summer was no exception — a wide
array of construction and remodeling pro
jects were underway across campus. Some
are still in their opening stages, some were
completed and some are in the thick of the
process — but all aim to provide Stanford
students, faculty and staff with an improved
University environment.
I"he following is a rundown of several major
projects which were ongoing over the summer:


MATT SAYLES/lhe Stanford Daily
Building 160, which will house the high-tech Wallenberg Global Learning Center when it opens in
July 2002, is undergoing a major seismic upgrade and renovation.
Wilbur Dining
Renovation of the Wilbur 11.ill
dining servery, which began this
past spring as part ol the T Diversi
ty's Capital Improvement Pro
gram, is slated lor completion .it
the end ol November, acc»>rding to
Exec. Dir. of Dining Services
Shirley Everett.
I he renovations will bring
"brighter colors and accent light
ing, new area separations, im
proved heating and ventilation
and new flooring, to Wilbui Din
ing, Everett said.
In addition, "the new design
features energv-ellicient state-of
the-art equipment, inc hiding exhi
bition-cooking stations: Asian wok.
fresh pasta, saute, rotisserie and
grills." she said. "The serverv will
otter 'grab and go' items, fresh
pizza, home meal replacement, .1
Starbucks coffee and dessert sta
tion and tantali/ing snacks."
One ol the biggest changes in
volves switching from .1 traditional
all-you-can-eat set of meal plans to
an a la (arte, declining balance
points system, similar to that in
place at Manzanita Dining.
Until the revamped serven is
opened, students will eat food
catered from Stern Dining in the
refurbished Wilbur dining rooms.
Some items will be gi illed on site- at
Wilbur Dining, where .1 soup and
salad bar will also be provided,
Everett said.
Cowell Student Health Services
Construction of the new Allene
C». Vaden Health Center, which
will replace the Cowell Student
Health Sen ices building, is on
schedule and w ill be completed In
next summer.
file project, which began in
June and will cost an estimated
$9.0 million, will "create .1 vast im
provement in the comfort, privacv
and efficiency of health care and
counseling, while correcting seis

mic and code problems, including
disabilit\ access to exam rooms
and offices," said Dr. Ira Fried
man, director of Cowell.
1 he new site will be reconfig
ured to include the same amount
of parking .is the current site,
Friedman said.
During construction, the for
mer ( owell Line will be closed at
Campus Drive. Lane C behind
Cowell will be the main access to
the fen a and Pi Phi houses in
Cowell Cluster, according to
Friedman. Also, noise levels due
to construction will be highest in
the coming two to three weeks
while sheet metal decking is being
installed.
Cowell staff will move into the
new buildingat its completion next
summer, but demolition of the ex
isting facility, landscaping ,ind
parking lot replacement will not
occ 111 until fill 2002.

within the Bio-\ Program lor Bio
engineering, Biomedic ine and
Biosciences, is being partially
funded b\ a $90 million gift from
| im (Hark, .1 former Stanford pro
lessor and co-founder ol Netscape.
Construction of the new build
ing has brought challenges, such as
substantial redirection of parking.
Approximated MO spaces on the
east side of Fairchild will be dis
placed to Stock Farm Road.
" I he Clark building replaces a
parking lot |but] will also provide
lots of attractive landscape and
open ,11 cas," Burgett said.
I mil construction is completed,
Burgett urges students, facultv
and stall to "stav outside of the
fenced areas and pay attention to
posted signage alerting tlieni to

detours or changes."

Historic hand-carved sand
stone and marble columns inside
the building, which began as the
1 homas Welton Stanford Li
brary, were cut into pieces and
lifted via crane through roof
trusses. 1 lie sandstone was set
aside for possible use in repairing
future earthquake damage, while
the marble was taken to a nearby
quarry, 1 odd said.
I he new center will bring to
gether scholars from around the
world to conduct various studies
regarding learning processes and
technologies.
