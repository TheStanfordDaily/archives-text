# Homes, sweet homes: a rundown of campus residences
## 
### JIMMY BOEGLE, KIM DOWNS, JULIANA LIU MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Welcome to Stanford and wel
come to your new dormitory —
your home for the next nine
months. As you become acquaint
ed with the campus, you will begin
to distover that there is a lot of his
tory here, and your dormitory is
no exception.
Here is a briel history of each
dormitory or house that will be
home to freshmen during this
2001 -2002 school year.
Branner Hall
Branner sucks. Period. 1 "hat is
how everybody feels, unless vou
actually live there; ii is an unoffi
cial Stanford rule. Branner is the
largest all-frosh dorm on campus,
and every year the Branneritcs
are generally known to be the
most boisterous, obnoxious group
of freshmen on campus. I heir un
mistakable chants ai football
games and their annual disrup
tion of Gaieties, the Big Game
week musical, have annoy ed other
students for decades.
Branner was not always known
for its obnoxiousness. I he dormi
tory opened m 1924 and was
named after John Caspar Bran
ner, Stanford's president from
1913 to 1915. Originally an all
women's dormitory, the dorm
changed between all-male and all
female several times before lie
coming one of the first toed dorms
on campus. When only women
lived there, the urinals in the bath
rooms were reportedly made into
flower pots of some sort.
During one of the all-female
periods, current Supreme Court
justice Sandra Dav O'Connor
made her home there.
Recently, Branner has been
home to its "Branner Presents"
speaker series, which brings peo
ple from the campus and beyond
to disc uss issues and events.
I hough Br,inner features two

room triples today, two people
were originally assigned to each
set of rooms. Branner will be
closed for renovation during the
2002-2003 year.
Florence Moore Hall
Otherwise known as Flo Mo,
this dormitory opened in the fall
of 1950, making headlines for its
incredible cost. I lie structure with
seven different divisions — Alon
dra, Cardenal, Faisan, Cavil.m,
Loro, Mirlo and Paloma — cost
over $2.05 million to build. Of
that, over $1 million was donated
In Florence Moore. Her husband,
Robert Moore, joins her in having
a residence named after him, a
Row house ( ailed Robert S. Moore
South or, more commonly, Bob.
( her the years, Flo Mo has flip
flopped between being an all-fe
male and an all-male residence; it
is currently coed.
It has been renovated several
times. An improvement project
was completed in 1975, costing
$1.3 million. Housing for about
100 students was also added in the
1975 renovation.
Flo Mo may be best known toi
three things: First, it houses the
only residential Introduction to
the Humanities track — Struc
tured liberal F.ducation, or SI.F;
second, most rooms boast
panoramic views thanks to their
wall-to-wall windows; third, ice
cream is served daily in the dining
hall. I he often-recounted story is
that Florence Moore gave money
to build the residence on the con
dition that the dessert be served
every day.
Court
I his set of dorms, which also
shares its name v\ ith Stanford's oc
c asionallv full man-made lake, was
construc ted in 1933. I oday it is
home to five four-class houses:
Adelfa, Fucalipto, Granada,
Naranja and I jamaa.
Sometimes affectionately re
ferred to .is "the fire trap," Lagu
nita has seen .it least one major fire

in its history. I he resident fellows'
apartment in West Lagunita
binned down in November 1974.
I'lie lire, which caused $12,000 in
damage, was ruled accidental.
In March <>i 1976, the Olivo
Magnolia house, as it was then
called, changed its name to I jamaa,
a Swahili word meaning "unity" or
"family." I jamaa is the African-
American ethnic theme dorm.
Lag is notorious for its ultra
cramped freshman doubles,
which are the si/e of upperclass
singles.
M uwek ma-Tah-R uk
Muwekma is the Native-Ameri
can theme house, its name means
"House of the People" in the
Muwekma language and was
named in honor of an Olilone
tribe indigenous to the area.
I'lie house hosts a three-week
summer immersion program for
incoming undergraduates.
()riginally open only to upper
classmen, Muwekma has housed
freslunen since 199.3. Six of 28 ies
idents every year since then have
been freslunen.
Muwekma is one of the main
sponsors for 11 u - Stanford Pew wow,
one of the largest in the country,
held during spring quarter.
Ruble Hall
I lie oldest ac tive dormitory on
campus, Roble 11.ill arguably has
the most interesting history of any.
Roble — which means "oak" in
Spanish — opened in its current
location in 1918 as a women's resi
dence. When ii yvas construc ted,
records shoyved it yvas built entirely
with reinforced concrete. Howev
er, it yvas discovered in a 1987 re
view of dormitories for earthquake
s.iletv that the records were incor
rect.
After discovering that the exte
rior walls were made of hollow
c lav tile with a reinforced cone ietc
floor and frame, Roble was deter
mined to be the least quake-safe
building on campus.
It was so unsafe, in fact, that the

l 1 diversity decided to close the
dormitory. On Dec . 19, 1987, it
closed its doors and residents were
relocated when tliev came back
from winter break. Many of the
294 displaced students tried 10
convince the I niversitv to let
them stav through the year, but
their pleas were to no .iv ail.
Stern Hall
1 ,uc ie Stern Mali, the concrete
block of dormitories located on
the eastern portion ol campus,
opened in 19 19. I he S 1.2 million
dormitory vv.is partially btuli with

will loi $400,000 to build .i men's
dormitory, and ultimately anoth
er $200,000 from hei estate yvas
given tc» Stanford to build the

dorm that would bear her name.
Stern 11 all's unique, square ar
chitectural style has been much
maligned since before its opening.
Renovated in 1995, Stern's build
ings now boast a color resembling
smoked salmon. Stern lias six
houses: Burbank, Donner,
I .arkin, Sei ra, I wain and (l.is.i Za
pata, the Chicano Latino theme
dorm.
Stern's culinary sty le tradition
ally was the butt of jokes around
campus, but a renovation during
the summer of 2000 that ci eated a
huge, colorful servery has signifi
cantly boosted food quality.
Wilbur Hall
Wilbur Hall, built in 1950, was
named after Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who became Stanford's president in
1910. He retired as president in
194 I, but he ac tually staved on as
