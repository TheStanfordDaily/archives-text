some of the most frequently asked (|iiestions:

AMath: 11 sou do not have AP n edits 01 1 ol
leue transfei t1 edit and wish to lake math.

you should take the math placement test. I hose
wht) have APt retlits are encouraged to take the
test as well. Math placement tests last an hour.
I .ike them on computers in dorm clusters. Plan
to take this test he fore you meet with your advi
sor. Yom store, which you will gel as soon as
vou finish the test, is strictly personal informa
tion that you can use to decide which math (lass
vou will enroll in at Stanford.
Chemistry: If you want to take chemistry at
Stanford and do not have APt reclit or trans
fer credit, you should take the online place
ment exam, whit h also takes about one hour.
Youi score is confidential and will be used to
plate you in a chemistry course 011 campus.
Check vour Orientation calendar for times
and locations.
Foreign languages: The I'diversity requires all
students to athieve competence in a foreign
language equivalent to a third quarter, first
veai course. II you have studied a foreign lan
guage and plan to take the same language at
Siaut<)t d, vou need to lake the plat ement test to
determine which (lass to take. Some students
have completed the written section <>l the test
online over the summer. I he oral exam is still
required, and times for these tests are listed iu
the ()rientation guide. Students who have not
taken the online section should contact that lan
guage's coordinator.

A\n excellent question, because navigat
ing around an S, 1 80-at ret ampus u here
ever\ huiltlinu looks vainieh like I.no Bell

can trip up even those who are handy with a
compass.
First, some words of warning: Hoover lower
serves as a poor landmark, because ii looks the
