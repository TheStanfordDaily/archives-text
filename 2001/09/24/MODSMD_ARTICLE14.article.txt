1990
()ii Sept. 24, 1990, 1 lie Daily printed a
letter about the University's housing hills
lor ( leaning.
"When I moved out of an tscondido Vil
lage high-rise two vears ago, 1 spent consid
erable time ( leaning, but received a ( lean
ing bill for $15 anyway. Near as I could tell
from i.ilking to others, everyone who
moved out was similarly billed.
"1 contacted the Kscondido Village of lice
and demanded to know why I was being
billed. I was told that there was cleaning
th.it was done. I told them that 1 wanted to
know what ( leaning was done. They said
they'd look into it.
"Alter two weeks of calling to find what
had been found, they told me that the
diarges had been dropped. I never did get
an answer to what cleaning, or, I suspect,
lack thereof, I had been billed for."
Bottom line: If only all bills could be taken care of
in a similar manner...
