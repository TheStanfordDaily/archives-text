Animators working on the movie
Shrek spent two months crafting a
technically complex 31/2-second shot.
The star wasn't the rotund green ogre
in the movie's title role, hut a frothy
glass of milk.
Stanford University computer sci
entist Henrik Wann Jensen has been
searching for a way to create realistic
digital milk, and after a year of work
he has come up with what computer
graphics experts say is the first solu
tion that is true to life.
'It seems like something that's so
simple, hut no one has rendered a con
vincing picture of a glass of milk,'
said Jensen.
Jensen's quest began in earnest last
fall with a comprehensive search on
the Internet. That yielded references to
a few promising papers in scientific
journals, which he tracked down in
the musty, fluorescent-lighted stacks
on the second floor of the Physics Li
brary at Stanford, where he is a re
search associate in the Computer
Graphics Laboratory. For months he
pored over papers, books and doctoral
theses. y ~
