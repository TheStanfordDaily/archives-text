## The 						Stanford Daily Forging stronger alliances to dig beneath the surface 
### 
Published Since 18') I

Up until .i couple of weeks ago, there
was.i joke that (INN stood for "(on
dit News Network." National news
magazines featured the terror of
shark attacks on their covers. People be
moaned i ising gas prices in front page stories
and on prime-time television.
While I lie Daily has not run sensational
articles about the Cruise Can/ connection
and how Kidman lits in, the recent relot us
ing ol national attention on news of import
and substance should att as an inspiration
to us all.
Since I he Daily is. lor mam. the only source
of news on campus, the need for it to he a news
paper of precision, balance and depth is ol
paramount importance.

Yet as we the staff come in and out of the
office dav after day, fitting editing into our
routines just as we do class, c alls to Mom and
burritos at the Treehouse, there is a tenden
cy to follow the journalistic path of least re
sistance. News stories can be lifted right out
of e-mail, sports coverage c an be dictated by
game schedules, editorials can be written In
those who feel the need to vent about the
Draw yet again.
We owe il to ourselves, to our peers and to
tlie I Jniversity as a whole to write w itli the pas
sion lliat comes from being thoughtful and
well-informed, rather than with the fire of in
complete information.
I bis cannot be accomplished without in
creased communication between I lie- l)ail\

and the community it serves. 1 have been told
several times that by working with the ASSI or
meeting with University administrators I'll
compromise l'he Daily's objectivity and inde
pendence. 1 respectfully but adamantly dis
agree.
Every conversation, every meeting and
everv introduction brings with it added com
mitment to accuracy. Getting to know a
greater number of campus leaders and com
munity members doesn't mean that I he
Daily will turn into one big endorsement of
pet causes; instead it means the articles will
have vet another layer of depth, a broader
background and a balance based upon a
more solid foundation of knowledge. Edito
rials I hat praise or support will be written

with greater conviction; those that criticize
or oppose will do so with more force and
persuasion.
Once the avenues of communication have
been cleared, broadened and repaved, The
Daily will be in a position to act as a forum for
thought, discussion and the meaningful dis
course that too of ten doesn't exist at Stanford -
or at least in 1 he Daily.
1 believe that increased editorial substance
will encourage this community to voice its
opinions. Write a letter. Submit a guest col
umn. join the editorial board. The more you
communicate with us - and in turn the more
we reach out to you -the better our newspaper
will be.
