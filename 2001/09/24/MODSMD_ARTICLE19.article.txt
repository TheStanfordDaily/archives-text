Professor calls for recognition of universi
ties' past relationships with slavery
We're hearing .1 lot about the connec
tions <>l great American universities to
slavery. Harvard Law School's first en
dowed chair was funded with mone\
made oil of (Caribbean slaverv, where lite
was particularlv heinous for slaves. 1 lie
family that founded Brown made mm h of
their money on the slave trade.
Recent 1\ we have been reminded that
many of Yale's colleges and buildings are
named after slave-owners. F.ven John ('..
Calhoun, the most notorious pro-slavery
thinker of them all, li.is a college named
after him at Yale. No one's mentioned
Princeton recently, though slaves worked
on that campus.
I hen there are the great southern uni
versities, which were founded bv slave
holders and that sought to justify slavery:
the University of Virginia (founded by Jef
ferson); Washington and Lee (named
after two slaveholders, one of whom was a
leader of the war to maintain slavery);
William and Man and Randolph-Macon
('.olleges, whose presidents authored lead
ing pro-slavery traits. I'he list goes on. In
deed, the list of southern schools that
weren't bastions of pro-slavery thought is
much shorter than those that were.
I he recent discussion of slavery at
st hools like Yale leads one to ask why does
all that matter? Many think it is simply ir
relevant. Prof. |ohn McWhorter of UC-
Berkeley, one of this country's leading
conservative black intellectuals, maintains
it is "inappropriate to render a moral
judgment on the worth of a person's life
based on moral standards which didn't

exist at that time."

Emerson was telling students to reject out

In the wake of the Fugitive Slave Act ol
1850, which required northerners to re
turn fugitive slaves to their southern own

country argued fiercely in favor of the act.

I'here are some lessons in this for us. It
reminds us that at many times universities
are the product and beneficiary of the

great interests (in this case what used to be
called the "slave power"). And so they are
often more likely to justify than to con
demn those interests. Prof. McWhorter is
just another in a long line of teachers,
stretching back to the leading proslavery
authors of the 1800s, who believe with
Alexander l'ope that "whatever is, is
right."
I le ma\ honestly, if mistakenly, believe
that slaven was morally (though not legal
ly) acceptable in the 18H0s; he ma\ even
believe that it is wrong to condemn a uni
versity for accepting proslavery dogma
rather than challenging it. But mavbe we
can realize with Emerson that it is the duty
of the scholar to rethink old institutions
and old ideas — and that it is the dutv of
university to lead the path.

the University of Virginia (founded by Jef

Professor calls for recognition of universi
ties' past relationships with slavery
We're hearing .1 lot about the connec
tions <>l great American universities to
slavery. Harvard Law School's first en
dowed chair was funded with mone\
made oil of (Caribbean slaverv, where lite
was particularlv heinous for slaves. 1 lie
family that founded Brown made mm h of
their money on the slave trade.
Recent 1\ we have been reminded that
many of Yale's colleges and buildings are
named after slave-owners. F.ven John ('..
Calhoun, the most notorious pro-slavery
thinker of them all, li.is a college named
after him at Yale. No one's mentioned
Princeton recently, though slaves worked
on that campus.
I hen there are the great southern uni
versities, which were founded bv slave
holders and that sought to justify slavery:
the University of Virginia (founded by Jef
ferson); Washington and Lee (named
after two slaveholders, one of whom was a
leader of the war to maintain slavery);
William and Man and Randolph-Macon
('.olleges, whose presidents authored lead
ing pro-slavery traits. I'he list goes on. In
deed, the list of southern schools that

much shorter than those that were.
