## ASU falls to Stanford 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the freshmen piled into Stanford Stadium
Saturda\ night for their first Stanford football game,
they saw main of the things the ( ordinal faithful have
learned to expect.
Stanford (2-0, 1-0 Pacific Pen Conference) served
up its usual fare ol high powered oflense, inspired
quarterback play and explosive wide receivers. Yet
the Cardinal also brought some new items to the
table, including defensive composure, a huge contri
bution bv a running hat k and special teams bravado.

FOOTBALI
Saturday: Stanford 51, Arizona State 28

I"!it- result was a 31 -28 victory out Arizona State
I niversity (1-1,0-1) and a strong statement to the rest
of the Pac-lOthat their dates with Stanford ma\ bea lit
tle more difficult than previoush expei ted.
Cardinal senior quarterback Rand) Fasani used a
varieh of receive! s to pick apart the Sun Devil defense
for 295 vards and four touclidowus. ()n a night when
nine Stanford plavets caught passes and t< >i 11 scored re
ceiving touchdowns, sophomore l.uke Powell showed
himself to be Stanford's feature receiuT, catching six
passes for \ards.
"I le was exciting, that is all vou can sa\." Stanford
head coach I \ rone Willing!).«m s.iid. "1 le made some
big plays in the open field and he just had an ex( iting

Fwo of these big plavs came in Stanford's first stor

"I have said since the preseason that we were going

Arizona State answered with .i four play. (iS-yard

Stanford scored on its next drive on a 19-yard touch

his first collegiate rushing attempt.

Stanford's defense stepped up to contain the Sun

Powell slashed through the Arizona State punt team,

1 'his began a night of exceptional special teams pla\
lor the Cardinal, which was consistently blessed with ex
cellent field position after Arizona State ku kofls. Stan
ford returned lour kit ks for l.'W yards in the contest,
with Wells taking one kick back 39 vards and junior
Brian Allen returning three kicks for 94 vards, one a 59-
yard third quarter stamper.
Powell's long return set up a three-yard tout hdown
plunge by junior kern Carter, giving Stanford a 20-7
lead .it the end of the first quarter.
rhroughout the game Willingham alternated run

tuisK listed at 5-10 and 200 pounds, tin ives in the open
field and consistentlv breaks outside defenses and turns
the ball up the sidelines.
On this night, Allen's approach proved more suc
cesstiil, as he gained 135 yards on 13 c arries, int lutling
a 47-vartl touchdown down the Stanford sideline at the
end of the third quarter.
" I bis is what we want to do," Allen said. "Our goal is
to have both Kern and I over 100 vards. | Kei i \ and 11
both learn and feed oil of each other. 1 bnight 1 had
more yards, but I know that next week that is what he is

I he second quarter saw both teams make field goals
and Stanford score on a 32-vartl pass to \ uk Sebes, who
filketl out two Sun Devil defenders on a < utbat k before
crossing the goal line. Stanford went into the lixkri
room at half time holding a 3(f-13 lead and running on

"| Powell | is one of the most ex

a bruising forward on the Stan

Cardinal's third-string quarter

Not realizing that Johnson is
still learning how to pla\ wide re
ceiver, Stanford fans seem to al

tlie game, abu// goes around
Stanford Stadium. And it should.
While he's still learning how to
run his routes to perfection, John
son's si/e, speed and quickness
cannot be taught.
Johnson did catch a nice 23-
vard pass that led to |arcd New
berry's first touchdown, but it is
inside the "red zone" where he
presents matchup problems for
opposing defenses.

defensive back is (i-foot-1, had

As effective as the fade pattern
has been, Fasani actually hasn't
thrown the ball high enough on
either of Johnson's touchdowns.
Yet, Johnson was still able to reel
in both passes while Ue was de
scending, showing that he has
enough strength to complement
his leaping ability.
"You can throw the ball up to

touchdown last Saturdav, he was
responsible for four. Powell's big
pla\ s of 20, 21. 37 and 17 vards all
led lo Stanfoi tl s( <>i is.
Needing onl\ the smallest
crevit e to tin nt routine live-yard
reception into a morale-crushing
stamper, the elusive sophomore
ecrih resembles a taw I ro\ Wal
ters. And he t an be better.
"| Powell | is one of the most ex
plosive plavers in the |Pacific 10
Confereiue|," lasani said. "I love
throw ing tlie ball to him."
Willingham described Powell
and Ins performance with one
wot tl: "I \t iting."
"1 \i iting" is also an apt descrip
tion for Johnson.
I he team's most unpolished
ret civet — he spent last season as
a bruising forward on the Stan

ford basketball team and as the
Cardinal's third-string quarter
back. — Johnson is also the most
intriguing \videout.
Not realizing that Johnson is
still learning how to pla\ wide re
ceiver, Stanford fans seem to al
ways expect him to make big
plavs. W hen number five enters
tlie game, abu// goes around
Stanford Stadium. And it should.
While he's still learning how to
run his routes to perfection, John
son's si/e, speed and quickness
cannot be taught.
Johnson did catch a nice 23-
vard pass that led to |arcd New
berry's first touchdown, but it is
inside the "red zone" where he
presents matchup problems for
opposing defenses.
l he Sun Devils, whose tallest
defensive back is (i-foot-1, had
no one that came close to John
son's 6-7 frame.
1 he mismatch definitely
showed as Fasani, just as he had
against Boston ( ollege two weeks
before, threw a 13-yard fade pat
tern that Johnson easily reeled in
fora touchdown.
As effective as the fade pattern
has been, Fasani actually hasn't
thrown the ball high enough on
either of Johnson's touchdowns.
Yet, Johnson was still able to reel
in both passes while Ue was de
scending, showing that he has
enough strength to complement
his leaping ability.
"You can throw the ball up to

him in lilt- air and have confi
dence that he will come down
with the ball," lasani said.
Because most cornerbacks
bounce oil Johnson like he's a
wall and can hardlv come close to

his leaping al>ilit\. the best de
fense against the fade ma\ he just
a yellow penalty llag.
As the players and coaches are
quit k to admit, it's only been two
games. But in a league known

lor explosive oilenses and weak
secondaries, Stanford's trio of
explosive receivers will be in
strumental if the (Cardinal is to
sprint awav from the glut oll'ac:-
10 contenclei s.
