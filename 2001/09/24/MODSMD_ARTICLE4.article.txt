In a unique twist to the (Campaign for
I ndergr.iduate Kducation, five students
taking part in overseas programs and in
Sophomore ( < >llege will keep online jour
nals to help donors gain an understand
ing ol how Stanford w ill use their gifts.
I he students, who will update their
join nals twit ea week, will dot ument their
expei ieiu e through w riling and pit tures.
I he idea for the journals came from
the communications department in
Stanford's Office of Development,
which is aiming to r.iise SI billion
through the (ampaign.

I be goal is "to raise the awareness of
alumni about CI K, but also to show
rather than tell our alumni how wonder
ful these programs are,'' s.iid Becky Smith,
a member of the development ollice stall .
"It's the next best thing to letting the all mi
ni take part in the programs themselves.''
Potential students from Sophomore
College were first selected by program
director Shari Palmer and later ap
proached by Smith. All students going
abroad this quarter received an e-mail
from Smith.
"1 w as over'whelmed In the number of
overseas students who said tliev were
willing to take part," Smith said. I he final
live students were selec ted based on pre

vious experience with writing <>v main
raining a Web site.
Renee Reyna, .1 junior w 1 1<> w ill spend
tail quarter in ( liilc, said, "I think a main
reason I was chosen had to do with the
fact that I had a Web site."
Re\ iki s.iid she wanted to keep a jour
nal as a unique wa\ of coiuinunitaling
with her family and friends and a fun
method of keeping her memories.
Nicole Wright and fon\ Sung are
sophomores who have now completed
their S< >phomore( n >llegc e\j H-rieiu es.
Kat li student brings his 01 her ow 11 ap
proach to the journals. Junior \le\
(Jreninger, in ()xford this quarter
said, " I want to emphasize the lad
that the journal is not going to be,
'We went to London,' [and] then a
pit lure ol Big Ben. Ii needs to be a
little less trite than that."
"I saw the journals as an oppor
tunity to write on .1 daily basis about
topics relevant to many students
and Stanford community mem
bers." Wright said. "For instance, I
put in a column about how women
were wrongly portrayed in the texts
of our reading list."
All of the students have already
Ix'gun their journals and are getting
a feeling for what it is like to share
their experiences 011 the Internet.
"I've already had two people e
mail me back — they were both
older alumni — and they were
genuinely interested in what I was
doing," Megan Kni/e, .1 junior
studying iti Paris, said.
Reyna has heard from alumni
who have gone to (.hilt* or now
live in ( bile. " I he\ have offered
some great advice from every
thing to what rivet s 1 should raft
011 to memories of when tliev
spent time there."
1 he five students keeping tlie
journals are volunteering their
time and eflort. I he lniversit\
lias supplied the undergrads with
digital cameras and batteries so
that the\ can put pictures next to
the journal entries, 1 hev will re
turn the cameras once t lie journals
are completed.

As for any censorship or guid
ance fioin the University, "it's
pretty much free reign," Kni/e
said. 1 lie onl\ suggestion thus lai
is for the five students to write one
journal entry about the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11.
"If the journals are well re
ceived, 1 would like to select otliei
programs that are Ix'iielitting from
CI K and do something similar.
Smith said. "I might ask .1 student
who is doing a I ROOI who is tak
ing part in Stanford in Washington
to keep a journal fora quarter."
In addition to the online jour
11.lis, which began ibis fall, the
campaign will go on the road, in

experience < ailed "Think Again.

I ndergr.iduate Kducation, five students
taking part in overseas programs and in
Sophomore ( < >llege will keep online jour
nals to help donors gain an understand
ing ol how Stanford w ill use their gifts.
I he students, who will update their
join nals twit ea week, will dot ument their
expei ieiu e through w riling and pit tures.
I he idea for the journals came from
the communications department in
Stanford's Office of Development,
which is aiming to r.iise SI billion
through the (ampaign.

I be goal is "to raise the awareness of
alumni about CI K, but also to show
rather than tell our alumni how wonder
ful these programs are,'' s.iid Becky Smith,
a member of the development ollice stall .
"It's the next best thing to letting the all mi
ni take part in the programs themselves.''
Potential students from Sophomore
College were first selected by program
director Shari Palmer and later ap
proached by Smith. All students going
abroad this quarter received an e-mail
from Smith.
"1 w as over'whelmed In the number of
overseas students who said tliev were
willing to take part," Smith said. I he final
live students were selec ted based on pre

vious experience with writing <>v main
raining a Web site.
Renee Reyna, .1 junior w 1 1<> w ill spend
tail quarter in ( liilc, said, "I think a main
reason I was chosen had to do with the
fact that I had a Web site."
Re\ iki s.iid she wanted to keep a jour
nal as a unique wa\ of coiuinunitaling
with her family and friends and a fun
method of keeping her memories.
Nicole Wright and fon\ Sung are
sophomores who have now completed
their S< >phomore( n >llegc e\j H-rieiu es.
Kat li student brings his 01 her ow 11 ap
proach to the journals. Junior \le\
(Jreninger, in ()xford this quarter
said, " I want to emphasize the lad
that the journal is not going to be,
'We went to London,' [and] then a
pit lure ol Big Ben. Ii needs to be a
little less trite than that."
"I saw the journals as an oppor
tunity to write on .1 daily basis about
topics relevant to many students
and Stanford community mem
bers." Wright said. "For instance, I
put in a column about how women
were wrongly portrayed in the texts
of our reading list."
All of the students have already
Ix'gun their journals and are getting
a feeling for what it is like to share
their experiences 011 the Internet.
"I've already had two people e
mail me back — they were both
older alumni — and they were
genuinely interested in what I was
doing," Megan Kni/e, .1 junior
studying iti Paris, said.
Reyna has heard from alumni
who have gone to (.hilt* or now
live in ( bile. " I he\ have offered
some great advice from every
thing to what rivet s 1 should raft
011 to memories of when tliev
spent time there."
1 he five students keeping tlie
journals are volunteering their
time and eflort. I he lniversit\
lias supplied the undergrads with
digital cameras and batteries so
that the\ can put pictures next to
the journal entries, 1 hev will re
turn the cameras once t lie journals
are completed.

As for any censorship or guid
ance fioin the University, "it's
pretty much free reign," Kni/e
said. 1 lie onl\ suggestion thus lai
is for the five students to write one
journal entry about the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11.
"If the journals are well re
ceived, 1 would like to select otliei
programs that are Ix'iielitting from
CI K and do something similar.
Smith said. "I might ask .1 student
who is doing a I ROOI who is tak
ing part in Stanford in Washington
to keep a journal fora quarter."
In addition to the online jour
11.lis, which began ibis fall, the
campaign will go on the road, in
(lie form of .1 half-day educational
experience < ailed "Think Again.
"Alumni (.111 come togcthci
.md take part in seminars and pan
els meant to give them an idea of
what the freshmen and sopho
more seminars are all about.
Smith said.
1 lie first event will be in Port
land, (>re., on Nov.
Last spring, Stanford treated
die ( I K video, a 14-ininute piece
that allowed alumni to reconnect
with their Stanford experience,
l lie campaign lias also sent mail
ings to tlie Stanford communitv
and launched a Web site .it
http://cue.stanford.edu that is up
dated regulath and includes the
student journals.
As of Sept. 1, ( l 112 has raised
%(VM) million, well past halfwa\ to
ward its goal. 1 lie inonev that is
raised will be used inostb in .111 en
dowment for iht- unic|ue under
graduate programs Stanford has
created in recent years.
