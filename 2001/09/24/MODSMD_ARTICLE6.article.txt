the undet gradutae writing requirement. Che bill
was approved Isat May.
I ncier thai measure, which takes effect in the fall
of 2003, Advanced Placement credit will no longer

taking two quarters of writing courses by the end of
their sophomore year.

writing options," Program Director Andrea Cunsford
said. "We'd like to ofler more courses related to writ
