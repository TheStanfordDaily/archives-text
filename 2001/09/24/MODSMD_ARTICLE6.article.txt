I he- Program in Writing and Rhetoric, formerly
known as Writing and C .1 itic al 1 '(linking, has made a
number of < lianges in its program this year.
But the program has even more changes
planned for the future, following the Faculty Sen
ate's appt oval of a bill wliic It will add more rigor to
the undet gradutae writing requirement. Che bill
was approved Isat May.
I ncier thai measure, which takes effect in the fall
of 2003, Advanced Placement credit will no longer
satisfy one of the two required writing courses. Stu
dents will have to fulfill a two-level requirement by
taking two quarters of writing courses by the end of
their sophomore year.
During the Faculty Senate meeting, f.nglish Prof.
1 li/abelh I raugott stressed the importance of writing
as a developmental proc ess.
With that in mind, PWR is developing second-level
courses that can feed into students' areas of interest,
while improving each student's written and oral com
munication skills.
"In the future, I want to offer a broader range of
writing options," Program Director Andrea Cunsford
said. "We'd like to ofler more courses related to writ
ing in the scientific fields."
"Writing is not limited to a spe
t itic time or disc ipline, I'W R Asst.
Direcioi Marvin Diogenes added.
Willi that goal in mind, I'WR is
inviting departments and pro
grams to develop theii own c ours
es which can satisfy the second
level wriling rec|uirement.
" I he second-level course in the
writing requirement is open,
I auisford said.
For instance, "Dave Lougee's
Ipublit speaking and writing
c ourses foi engineersl would only
have to be tweaked slightly,"
1 unslord said.
Lunsford also said that stu
denis might be able to fulfill the
second-tier writing requirement
in a language othei than Knglish.
"I think that it's wonderful to
be able to write as well .is possible
in as mam languages .is possi

"We have refurbished the Ilex
