1935
On Sep. 24, 1935, I'he Daily printed an
article about Stanford's new school cheer,
created by the Indians' yellmen.
'"We're well aware of campus skepticism
when a new yell is introduced,' Stark says.
'We're asking yon only to delay judgment
until this one has its test in the rooting sec
tion.'
"Here 'tis:
Wah—who—Wall
Wah—who—Wah
War —Cry
Stan —Stanford—Stan—Stanford
StaaanFOßl)
This yell became Stanford's permanent
possession when Sequoia's famous '21 re
treived the Axe in 1930 from California.
I he Axe tradition makes this yell the most
outstanding of the Stanford repertoire
Give 'em—the Axe
I he Axe—the Axe
Give 'em—the Axe
The Axe —the Axe
(live 'em —the Axe
Give em—the Axe
(iive 'em —the Axe WIIKRK?
Right—in the Nec k
The Neck—the Neck
Right—in the Neck
l he Neck —the Nec k
Right in the Neck
Right in the Neck
Right in the Neck 111 KRK!
(Slowlv and deliberate!) the first time,
but hold your hats on the second delivery.)"
Bottom line: We're no longer tfie Indians. So
"chirp — chirp — chirp" away. Oh, right. The
color, not the bird.
