In 1975, a 30-year-old electrical engi
neering researcher at Stanford had an
idea fora new kind of cryptography.
He thought his method could give the
public truly unbreakable codes for their
communications and other data, codes
even more powerful than those pro
duced by the National Security Agency,
the nation's premier ctxle-making and
code- breaking agency.
"/ remember thinking, 'I've got a
tiger by the tail'" said the scientist, Dr.
Martin Hellman, now an emeritus pro
fessor of electrical engineering at Stan
ford. Sure enough, the N.SA. soon
stepped in and tried to control the dis
semination of the work.
Dr. Hellman and others resisted. They
said that the agency's threats to restrict
them were violations of academic free
dom ... In the end\ the academic scien
tists prevailed. But now, in the after
math of the terrorist attacks on New
York and the Pentagon, Dr. Hellman and
others are wondering if they did the
right thing.
