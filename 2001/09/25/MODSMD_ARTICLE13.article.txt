If you arrived on campus early

cooperative house Chi I beta Chi

saw ing and sweeping .is part ol the
house's annual Work Week, w lik h
began on Sept. If) and ended last
Friday.
"It's a mix ol teen boot camp
and celebritx weddings." said ju
nior Mike I'appas, the house's res
ident assistant. "Since the house is
not I niversity-owned, the upkeep
is taken care ol by the residents."
I his year, students .it Work
Week built cabinets, painted the
kitchen walls, mowed the vard,
arranged the tool room and
cleaned bathrooms.
"We saved $25,000 l>\ doing .1
beautitul paint joboll the kin hen,"
s.iid junior Drew Haglino, one ol
the house's capital improvement
managers.
Students worked between six
and eight hours a d.i\. with "night
crew duty" assigned to those with
daytime commitments.
According to tin* students.
Work Week provided .1 much-ap
preciated chance to bond with
other residents belore the school

year began.
"Right now everyone knows
eat h other, which is not true of the
other dorms," Haglino said.
(!hi I heta ( hi used to be ow ned

cording to residents. During the
Vietnam War, when mam frater

dents said.
Fventuallv. the house became
entireh a co-op and "Chi" was
added at the beginning of the
name. According to students.
"(.hi" means "\" in (ireek and sig
naled the end ol the Iratet nil v.
I nlike most campus housing,

I nivcrsitv Ihe property it stands
on belongs to Stanford and is
leased to the alumni assoc i.ition ol
the national I heta ( lit frateinitv,
w hie h owns t lu- house.
Sponge-painted walls, student

surround the residents of the
co-op.
Ihe "c hapiei room," w hie h
used to house the fraternity's 1 ere
monies and still contains an alter
and pews, now serves as a one
room triple.
I he house is alwavs full ol the
students' works in progress, in
cluding a barbecjue, a stairwa\
mural and bene lies.
" I his is a super house. And this
kind ol collaboration breeds ,1

unique spirit," said mechanical en
gineering doctoral student ( lot win
I lardhain.
Student managers collect rent
directly Irom the tenants, who in
clude hoth graduate and under
graduate students. Residents cook,
iheit own meals and take turns
with regular house chores.
1 lie students also take care ol all
ol the maintenance on the house,
eithei completing the work them
selyes or hiring contractors as
needed. Mm h ol the maintenance
is completed during the Work
Weeks at the start of each year and
the weekends that precede winter
and spi ing quarters.
Despite student enthusiasm,
the(Xliicol Residential Kducation
has expressed concei n oyer health
and salet\ issues assot iated with
maintaining the house.
" 1 here are yen specific respon
sibilities outlined for those who are
leasing," said Res I d Director Jane
(amarillo. "The I niversity main
tains the right to withdraw the
lease based on compliance with
these responsibilities."
( amarillo said Res Kd does sup
port the programming aspects of
the house, however.
"It has been the location for
main students who are stxial ai
ti\ isis. en\ironmentalistsand inter
ested in sot ial justice," she said. "It
proyidesa unique environment for
dialogue and action, and we sup
port such programmatic diversity."

"I woi i \ about the toll tli.it [stu
deiil 1 management tan take," slit
said. " I his is not ,i very good ex
perience t(ii ilie students who an

not expecting this kind olliabilitv,
hut rather expect to he full-time
students."
Despite ( amarillo's concerns,
Chi l'heta ( hi residents still ex
press pride in their house.
"It's because everyone came

back early fbi Work Wee k that we
feci like sue li .1 faniib." said junioi
Emily Witten, the house's other
capital improvement managei
Pappas added. "It's ,1 small
price to pay, in terms of how 1 00l
the house is."
