News organizations have gone to great
lengths to report the level < >112 fear felt by
some Muslims since the terrorist at
tacks on New York and Washington,

cury News featured on its front cover several
Muslim women who have not left their San Fran
cisco apartment since the attacks out of fear of
public scorn and harassment. ('NN reported yes
terday that several do/en Arab students have
withdrawn from American colleges in fear of an
anti-Arab backlash.
Isolated incidents of discrimination against
Aral)-Americans have occurred. Several mosques
across the country have been vandalized in the
past two weeks. Flight crews have refused to take

Fven at Stanford, several Islamic groups received

overwhelming majority of Americans aim to un
derstand, accommodate and tolerate their lellow
(iti/ens, regardless ol race or religion.
I la- feeling of national unity tli.it has sprung
up sine e the attacks extends to Americans of all
backgrounds, especially Arab ones. President
Hush lias sei an example of tolerance, visiting a
mos<|ue the week after the attacks and exhorting
the nation in his address to (longress not to mis
direct its anger toward the Muslim-American
conimunih in general. Interlaith rallies held in
major cities, community centers, md college cam
puses a< loss the country encouraged Americans
torcspe< i eac liotherand not to draw conclusions
based on race.
Indeed, even in the wake of the attacks, manv
prominent Arab-American CF.Os, authors and

scholars have noted a fundamental improve
ment in American attitudes towards Arabs in the
years since the ( lull War.
A climate of tolerance, calm and understand
ing is just what America needs. It fits with all of
our nation's noblest ideals and it is necessary in
this time of impending conflict. The path to
achieving such a climate runs lx>th ways. We
should .ill aim to foster this sense of unity at Stan
ford In going alxnit our normal routines and not
excluding anylxxly for irrational reasons.
In this time of national tragedy and turmoil,
we must take the sound, fair-minded advice of
our leaders — that we not shroud ourselves in
fear, that we not rush to judgment and that weex
ercise tolerance — and apply it to every citizen of
our great and proud nation.
