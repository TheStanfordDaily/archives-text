## Volleyball rolls down to the Beach 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford and Long
Beach State met on Maples Pavil
ion's volleyball court last Oct. 14,
the match was played under very
mutual circumstances.
both of these volleyball power
houses — the two schools have
combined for seven national
championships, 19 Final Four ap
pearances and 18 conference
championships — came into the
man h in the midst of unprece
dented ruts.
At 9-0, the Cardinal had fallen
out of the top 10 in the rankings tor
the first time in 14 years, while both
Stanford and the 49ers were out of
the top 1") for the first time in as
long as anyone could remember.
But oh, what a difference a
year can make.
tonight's match between the
Nt). 112 ( Ordinal (8-0) and the No. 2
49ers(7-o)at the Pyramid in long
Beach will feature two of the na
tion's best teams, both undefeated
and both putting their forgettable
2000 seasons behind them.
"With Long Beach, it's a great
opportunity to test our strengths
against a really good team," saitl
senior middle blockei I'ara Con
rad, whose 1.78 blocks per game
ranks near the top of the Pacific
10 (.onlerent e.
"Beating them on their home
court will be .i great challenge, but
that is what we need to tit) to step
it up tt) the next level."

squad left for Soul hern ( aliloi nia
yesterday afternoon, less than 48
bout s after returning from Wash
ington — where Stanford
opened Pat-10 play this weekend
with wins over Washington and

Washington State. I he Cardinal
lias played all of its matt lies on the
road st> far and won't open play in
Maples until an Oct. 5 match-up
with Oregon State, Stanford's
12th match of the season.
First-year head coach John
Dunning has the formidable task
of keeping his players' spirits up
in spite of all the travel and the
start of classes later this week.
"(loing 8-0 on the road to start
our year is really something," saitl
Dunning, who came it) the Farm
after claiming two national titles
during a 10-year tenure at Pacific.
"We aren't going tt) feel a lot ol
pressure, because it's not a con
ference match and we have some
Pac-10 matches coming up that
are more important.
"It will si ill be good tosee how we
match up with one of the best teams
in the country," he continued.
Stanford's early-season success
can inostlv be attributed to Dun
ning's ability tt) find a consistent
lineup with solid chemistry from a
rosier filled tt) the brim with po
tential starters.
Of course, the continued stel
lar play of junior outside hitter

freshman outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani haven't hurt either.

Nnamani has tjuicklv established
herself as the premier freshman
in the Pac-10 and the nation, av
eraging over four kills and 2.5
tligs per game.
"1 think the level at which she
has succeeded has surprised a lot

o! people, including herself.
Dunning said of Nnamani. "She's
a real learner, and she's working
real I \ hard to improve. She hasn't
