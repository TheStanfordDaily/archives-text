# Jordan ready to suit up for the Wizards

WAS lIINCK )N (AP) — Michael Jot clan kept
his mouth shut and fax machine off, and the
sports world spent another day awaiting official
word of his return.
|ordan already has completed ilu- paperwork
to sell his share of the Washington Wizards, but
the comeback announcement was delayed for at
least one more clay because of a licensing issue
with one of his sponsors.
"Mr had has not finalized his decision," said Estee
Potmoy, vice president of marketing and client ser
vices for SFX, Jordan's management agency.
A statement from Jordan outlining the reasons
for his comeback was being finalized, and he is ex
pected to make his first appearance in a Wizards
uniform at media da\ in Washington next Mon
day — the day before training camp begins in
Wilmington, N.(
But before he can end his three-year retire
ment, shoot his first free throw or run his first
wind sprints, Jordan and legions of lawyers must
fine-tune the fine print.
Because owners can't play, Jordan had to sell
his share in Lincoln I loldings, which owns a por
tion of the Wizards, the NUl.'s Washington Cap
itals and the MCI Center. Jordan's stake, about 10
percent, goes to I jncoln I foldings majority owner
Ted Leonsis.
"My understanding is that the ownership doc
uments are finished," NBA deputy commissioner
RussCranik said. "It just requires Michael's deci
sion as to whether he's going to play."
Jordan not only must sell his shares in the
team, he will have to relinquish his job as Wizards
president ofbasketball operations. Those respon
sibilities will probably be turned over to general
manager Wes Unseld and assistant general man
ager Rod I liggins.
Unseld and Higgins would be free to consult
with Jordan, but NBA tampering rules would
prohibit Jordan from talking with officials from
other teams.
The question of "whether" Jordan will return
has essentially been replaced by "when," and this
latest dispute over licensing — if it drags on —
could conceivably delay the announcement for
several days.
