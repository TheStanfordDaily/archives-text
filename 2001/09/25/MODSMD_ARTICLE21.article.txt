# Oregon, UCLA leading the Pac

### MALCOLM LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
With one week of conference
play complete, the Pacific 10 Con
ference looks lo be one of the most
formidable conferences in the na
tion, with a plethora of potential
bowl-worthy teams and serious
1 leisman Trophy candidates.
Senior quarterback Joey Har
rington and his sixth-ranked ()re
gon Ducks (3-0, 1-0) are leading
ilu' Pac-10 pack, thanks to a last
second 24-22 victory over USC on
Saturday.
Down 22-21 with 50 seconds re
maining in the game, Harrington
led the Dut ks down the field on a
six-plav, 01-yard drive, culminat
ing in a game-winning 32-yard
field goal l>\ freshman kit kerjared
Siegel. I lie win marked the eighth
fourth-quarter comeback 1 larring
ton has led in his career, during
whit h he is now 17-2 as a starter.
While Harrington definitely
padded Ins potential Heisman sta
tus with vet another comeback vic
tory, other Pac-10 quarterbacks
have also made a name for them
selves in this short season, reaffirm
ing the Pac-1 0's reputation of pro
ducing high-llving offenses with
potent gunslingers at the helm.
Ip in the Palo use. junior quar
terback Jason (lesser has led sur
prising Washington State to a 3-0
st.nt while impressing pro scouts
along the was In Saturday's 51-20
romp ovei C.al, (lesser threw tor
432 vards and four touchdowns,
becoming the first C.ougai since
Ryan Leaf to top the 400-yard
mark in a single game.
Perhaps Cesser's greatest
achievement, however, has been
the molding of his inexperienced
set of wide receivers, consisting of

two junior college transfers and a
converted basketball player, into
one of the most dangerous group
of w ideouts in the conference.
In a situation quite similar to
that of Stanford sophomore two
sport star l'eyoJohnson, Washing
ton State's leading scorer on the
basketball team last season, Mike
Bush, decided to play wide receiv
er this season for the first time since
high school — and has become an
extremely dangerous target.
I sing his six-foot-six frame to
create mismatches with any possi
ble defender (much like Johnson),
Bush has hauled in 1 1 catches for
310 yards and two touchdowns in
his first three games, and now the
two-sport star says that he may
seek to play professional football
and not basketball.
Meanwhile, at UCIA, junior
quarterback Corey Pans has led
the No. 13 Bruins to an undefeated
record with his efficient play, not
turning the ball over once in the
season's first three games.
Although often overshadowed
In the improved play of the U( -LA
defense and the continued excel
lence of running back Deshaun
Foste — who has lifted himself
into the circle of Heisman candi
dates with his earls season's efforts
— Pans has solidified the quarter
back position for the Bruins and
turned the team into Bowl Cham
pionship Series material.
After a three-week layoff, Ore
gon State faces one of the nation's
hottest teams in 1(1 A, with a
chance to right its ship after what
has been a disappointing start.
Beaver running back and Heis
man candidate Ken Simonton
should have a tongh time running
against the revamped Bruin de
fense, so the game may rest on tlit
pel lormaiK e of senior quarterbai k
Jonathan Smith, who has not per
loi nied well in his first two games.

A loss for Oregon Slate would
put the team at I-2, which would
be a huge disappointment alter
its amazing 11-1 performance
last season, capped oil l>\ a 41-9
demolition of Notre Dame in the
Fiesta Bowl. Needless to sav, this
is a must-win game lor ('.oath
Dennis Krit ksou and his ()regon
State team.
