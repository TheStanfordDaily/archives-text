# Attacks result in increased security, delays
## Backpacks, coolers and large bags banned from Stanford Stadium; many teams games postponed 
### AARON LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hie nerves of !W,850 fans were settled at Stanford
Stadium on Saturday during the first Cardinal foot
hall game since the terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. No unexpected in
cidents were reported, no unusual behavior (aside
from that of the hand) took plate and an inspirational
cereinom before the game left feu spec tators with a
dry eye.
Yet, following Stanford's 51-28 victory over Ari
/ona State, many patrons left the stadium surprised
that they didn't have to wait much longer to get into
the stadium. A press release issued last week urged
fans to allow extra time for additional security mea
sures. Instead, many people breezed through Un
gates with no problem.
In fact, no additional security guards or policemen

were hired, and theonh new rule was that no one was
allowecl to bring in large bags, backpacks or coolers
into the stadium.
" I here was no need to hire any new people. We
just made sure evcr\one w.is more on alert," said Rob
Thompson, the assistant athletic clirec tor in c hai ge of
events and operations.
If anyone wanted to bring .i purse or small bag, it
u.is subjec I lo searc li .ii the gate. ()nly those with small
hags had to wait longer.
At c ording to Ra\ Purput. the associate director of
facilities and operations, the wait would have been
worse had more people brought sin.ill bags.
"Kveryone did a realh good job of leaving their
things at home, so we were able to get everyone in by
game lime." he said.
()ther additions for the game were more festive. A
t)0-b\- 10-foot American flag was stationed along the
South end of the stadium; it was the same flag used in
pre-game ceremonies at .'H'.om Park for the 49ers
game on Sunda\.
American flags and the words to the "Star-Span
gled Bannci were distributed lo all entrants. 1 he as
sistant clean of religious life, Joanne Saunders, gave an
inspirational talk before a moment of silence, and a

huge chorus of the national anthem followed—one
that could he heard as far away as Maples Pavilion.
"We didn't want to overdo anything, hut we want
ed to do everything in a respectful fashion. We want
ed to entourage .is main people as possible to partic
ipate," said Bob Carruesco, the assistant athletic di
rector in charge of marketing and ticket sales.
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham and Arizona
State heat I coach Dirk Koetter also helped break tradi
tion by having their teams on the field during die nation
al anthem, instead of in their respective locker rtxmis.
The game market! the first time the Card in ill had
taken the field since a victory over Boston College two
weeks earlier. Stanford was scheduled to play at San
lost- State on Sept. 15, but by mutual agreement both
schools postponed the game until Dec. 1
Almost two weeks after the tragedy, most other
Stanford teams that hat! games postponed now know
whether or not those contests will be rescheduled.
lo start, the women's volleyball team will not
reschedule its home Sept. 14 and 15 series with Arizona
and Arizona State unless it affects the eventual winner of
the Pacific 10 Conference. I lie Cardinal will still play
both opponents when it travels to Arizona in November.
I lowever, because Arizona and Stanford are both
top contenders for the league title, a rescheduling
may still take place at a later date, according to media
relations assistant Aimee Dombroski.
Men's sot cei was probably the most frustrated, be
cause its trip to Dallas, l ex., for the Nike Classic on
Sept. 14 and 15 was canceled. The Cardinal would
have had a chance to avenge last year's NCAA quar
terfinal loss to SMI . as it was slated to play the top
ranked Mustangs on Sept. 15.
The women's soccer team, primed to play No. 4
Notre Dame after a 4-0 start to its season, was forced
to cancel its game against the Fighting Irish on Sept.
It). It will not be rescheduled.
Water polo canceled a trip to Southern California,
where it would have played IC-San Diego and then
played in a tournament at I SC. While the tourna
ment was canceled indefinitely, the Cardinal will host
the Tritons in a rescheduled game Friday afternoon
at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Stuck in the Midwest on a road trip, the field hock
ey team was the only Cardinal contingent that com
peted during the five days following the attacks. It
played Sept. 11 against Ball State, canceled its game
against Central Michigan the day following the at
tacks and then played Miami (OH) on Thursday,
Sept. 13.
Because airports were still closed, the team spent
the next three and a half days in rental vans in order
to return to campus.
"It wasn't bad. It ended up Ix'ing a bonding expe
rience." head coach Shcryl Johnson said. "The girls
found different games to play, they had a spelling bee
and even wrote songs."

were hired, and theonh new rule was that no one was
allowecl to bring in large bags, backpacks or coolers
into the stadium.
" I here was no need to hire any new people. We
just made sure evcr\one w.is more on alert," said Rob
Thompson, the assistant athletic clirec tor in c hai ge of
events and operations.
If anyone wanted to bring .i purse or small bag, it
u.is subjec I lo searc li .ii the gate. ()nly those with small
hags had to wait longer.
At c ording to Ra\ Purput. the associate director of
facilities and operations, the wait would have been
worse had more people brought sin.ill bags.
"Kveryone did a realh good job of leaving their
things at home, so we were able to get everyone in by
game lime." he said.
()ther additions for the game were more festive. A
t)0-b\- 10-foot American flag was stationed along the
South end of the stadium; it was the same flag used in
pre-game ceremonies at .'H'.om Park for the 49ers
game on Sunda\.
American flags and the words to the "Star-Span
gled Bannci were distributed lo all entrants. 1 he as
sistant clean of religious life, Joanne Saunders, gave an
inspirational talk before a moment of silence, and a

huge chorus of the national anthem followed—one
that could he heard as far away as Maples Pavilion.
"We didn't want to overdo anything, hut we want
ed to do everything in a respectful fashion. We want
ed to entourage .is main people as possible to partic
ipate," said Bob Carruesco, the assistant athletic di
rector in charge of marketing and ticket sales.
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham and Arizona
State heat I coach Dirk Koetter also helped break tradi
tion by having their teams on the field during die nation
al anthem, instead of in their respective locker rtxmis.
The game market! the first time the Card in ill had
taken the field since a victory over Boston College two
weeks earlier. Stanford was scheduled to play at San
lost- State on Sept. 15, but by mutual agreement both
schools postponed the game until Dec. 1
Almost two weeks after the tragedy, most other
Stanford teams that hat! games postponed now know
whether or not those contests will be rescheduled.
lo start, the women's volleyball team will not
reschedule its home Sept. 14 and 15 series with Arizona
and Arizona State unless it affects the eventual winner of
the Pacific 10 Conference. I lie Cardinal will still play
both opponents when it travels to Arizona in November.
I lowever, because Arizona and Stanford are both
top contenders for the league title, a rescheduling
may still take place at a later date, according to media
relations assistant Aimee Dombroski.
Men's sot cei was probably the most frustrated, be
cause its trip to Dallas, l ex., for the Nike Classic on
Sept. 14 and 15 was canceled. The Cardinal would
have had a chance to avenge last year's NCAA quar
terfinal loss to SMI . as it was slated to play the top
ranked Mustangs on Sept. 15.
The women's soccer team, primed to play No. 4
Notre Dame after a 4-0 start to its season, was forced
to cancel its game against the Fighting Irish on Sept.
It). It will not be rescheduled.
Water polo canceled a trip to Southern California,
where it would have played IC-San Diego and then
played in a tournament at I SC. While the tourna
ment was canceled indefinitely, the Cardinal will host
the Tritons in a rescheduled game Friday afternoon
at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Stuck in the Midwest on a road trip, the field hock
ey team was the only Cardinal contingent that com
peted during the five days following the attacks. It
played Sept. 11 against Ball State, canceled its game
against Central Michigan the day following the at
tacks and then played Miami (OH) on Thursday,
Sept. 13.
Because airports were still closed, the team spent
the next three and a half days in rental vans in order
to return to campus.
"It wasn't bad. It ended up Ix'ing a bonding expe
rience." head coach Shcryl Johnson said. "The girls
found different games to play, they had a spelling bee
and even wrote songs."
