# Law school finishes major renovation
## 
### MAYA SEN 
Students at tlie Law School re
turned three weeks ago to find a
renovated, state-of-the-art class
room building complete with er
gonomic amenities and technolog
ical improvements where their
stuffy, poorly-lit and noisv class
rooms used to be.
1 he $8-million overhaul was
badly needed, according (<> Law
School administrators.
"The goal of the renovations
was to bring technology into the
classrooms, but .1 lot of other
things had to be done before we
could do that," said Frank Bruca
to, the I aw St boot's associate dean
for finance and chief financial offi
cer."The shapes of the classrooms
were .ill wrong, the sightlines were
all wrong and they were poorly
ventilated."
Shortly after Commencement
last June, hundreds of architects,
builders and technicians began
work on the project.
1 he monolithic edifice was
gutted from the inside. New
classrooms were constructed and
seating arrangements were reor
ganized to maximize efficiency
and minimize discomfort. Bruca
to said.

" Flu* safet\ and comfort of the
students was important," he said.
"We had the highest rate of carpal
tunnel syndrome .it the Universi
ty, so we wanted to address er
gonomics in our renovations."
While the size and scope of the
project make it one of the most
successful renovations in Stan
ford history, officials said the pro
ject was not completed without
complication.
"It was a nightmare. Everyone
said it couldn't be done," Brucato
said. "Fvery day was a nail-biter,
and we had no contingency plan.
Architects worked all day and all
night just to get the permits clone.
In the end, we finished on the
Monday before ()rientation."
Brucato s.iid the Law School's
renovations compare favorably to
an ongoing remodel at the Gradu
ate School of Business.
"They decided to renovate one
classroom and they're still not
clone," he said.
Reaction to the Law School's
renovations has been overwhelm
ingly positive.
"Without a question, these are
the most technologically advanced
legal classrooms in the country,"

Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences Sharon Long, now sever
al weeks into her new job, says she believes Stanford's humanities pro
grams have gained increased importance over the past decade.
said Carnet Williams, the school's
acting assot iate dean lor informa
tion systems.
" Hie students that I've talked
to love it," Williams added. "Stu
dent organi/ations in particular
have reallv jumped on the new
tei Imology."
Students now have wireless In
ternet at (ess in tin- (lassrootn, and
professors tan use high-tech au
diovisual equipment lot presenta
tions and lectures.
"It real I \ befits .1 law school of
our stature to have up-to-date and
technologically advanced class
rooms." said second-year Law
St hool student Sandra West.
Ana Rosado, also a second-year
student, s.iid, "At first sight, there's

not much of a differente, but the
rooms now are really well
equipped and it's easier for the
professors to use them."
In addition to the beefed-up
technology, students can relax in
the classrooms' 1,000 new Her
man Miller "Airon" chairs.
The reclining chairs were an
instant hit with students. "The
chairs here are a lot better than at
Vale Law School." said Stephanie
Hinderks, a first-year student. "1
like that they're adjustable. I hat
way 1 won't get tendonitis when
I'm typing."
First-year student Drew ()lejnik
agreed. "I like how they're er
gonomic for someone my si/e," he
said. "I'm so massive. I was wor
ried that the chairs here wouldn't
be able to withstand my bulk."
I he renovations are slated to
go beyond the chairs .mtl (lass
rooms. In an ambitious —

though still uncertain — plan,
ilit* Law School is considering a
further three-phase overhaul that
would entail a new law student
housing complex, a large infor
mation center and a complete
renovation of the Law School of
fice building.
Pending both funds and ap
proval from the University, the
$75-million projet t would begin in
2003, with the housing complex
tentatively set to be located in the
Stern 11 all parking lot on Alvarado
Row.
While Brucato said he is opti
mistic about the proposals suc
cess, he admitted, " There are a lot
of big ifs."
"With the economy slowing
and with (lie crisis in New York,
this isn't a good time to be
fundraising," lie said. "The Uni
versit\ is also very concerned
about Us debt."
