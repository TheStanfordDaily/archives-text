# Law school finishes major renovation
## 
### MAYA SEN 
Students at tlie Law School re
turned three weeks ago to find a
renovated, state-of-the-art class
room building complete with er
gonomic amenities and technolog
ical improvements where their
stuffy, poorly-lit and noisv class
rooms used to be.
1 he $8-million overhaul was
badly needed, according (<> Law
School administrators.
"The goal of the renovations
was to bring technology into the
classrooms, but .1 lot of other
things had to be done before we
could do that," said Frank Bruca
to, the I aw St boot's associate dean
for finance and chief financial offi
cer."The shapes of the classrooms
were .ill wrong, the sightlines were
all wrong and they were poorly
ventilated."
Shortly after Commencement
last June, hundreds of architects,
builders and technicians began
work on the project.
1 he monolithic edifice was
gutted from the inside. New
classrooms were constructed and
seating arrangements were reor
ganized to maximize efficiency
and minimize discomfort. Bruca
to said.

" Flu* safet\ and comfort of the
students was important," he said.
"We had the highest rate of carpal
tunnel syndrome .it the Universi
ty, so we wanted to address er
gonomics in our renovations."
While the size and scope of the
project make it one of the most
successful renovations in Stan
ford history, officials said the pro
ject was not completed without
complication.
"It was a nightmare. Everyone
said it couldn't be done," Brucato
said. "Fvery day was a nail-biter,
and we had no contingency plan.
Architects worked all day and all
night just to get the permits clone.
In the end, we finished on the
Monday before ()rientation."
Brucato s.iid the Law School's
renovations compare favorably to
an ongoing remodel at the Gradu
ate School of Business.
"They decided to renovate one
classroom and they're still not
clone," he said.
Reaction to the Law School's
renovations has been overwhelm
ingly positive.
"Without a question, these are
the most technologically advanced
legal classrooms in the country,"
