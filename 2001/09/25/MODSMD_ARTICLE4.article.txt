In a -statement responding to
Clark's decision, University Pres

regret but indicated that, like
Spudich, he understood Clark's
motivation.

into working heart cells.
"I saw a new future for medi

entrepreneurship, and I was in

ethical concept that embryonic

scientists all over the country,
who argued that denying re

would c lose off a potentially cru

"The Bio-X executive commit

search areas: molecular bio
physics, proteomics, genomics,
microbial biology, complex sys

Robertson said.
Both Long and Spudich said
they felt there was a chance the

be convinced down the line that
