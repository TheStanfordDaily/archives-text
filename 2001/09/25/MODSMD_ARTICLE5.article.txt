# Long plans to spend year listening, setting goals
## 
### ROBIN BURNS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sharon Long, the new dean <>1
the School ol I lumanities and S< i
ences, is entering a period ot
learning and transition at a lime
when the University faces some
major transitions of its own.
|ust three weeks into her new
job, Long addressed the precar
ious balance between the hu
manities and the sciences, the
use of the William Hewlett
Foundation's $300 million grant
— donated to the school last
spring — and the implications
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
for the I nivcrsity.
Long said her primar) goal for
this year is to continue to learn
about the breadth of the school
she now heads.
"During my first year, I will
do a lot of listening, and I will use
this year of education to help me
set goals." she said. "Ill count on
the advice of many colleagues
here at Stanford, and many
friends of the school as well, to
develop [my] vision."
When Stanford offered Long,
a biology professor, the position

last year, many students ex
pressed apprehension that het
appointment reflected the
school's shifting focus from the
humanities to the sciences.
I let promotion occurred in
the same quarter as the pro
posed language department
merger, which also aroused stu
dent critic ism.
Long, however, said that Stan
ford's humanities programs have
increased in importance ovet tlu
past dc( ade. She also said she be
lieves th,it her science back
ground makes her more c redible
when seeking support for the hu
manities because she can better
convince science supporters of
the field's importance.
"As Dean for our whole school,
Ill be the advoc ate of every field
in it," she said. "The critical ex
amination of every aspect ol
human activity is part of even - so
ciety, and onl\ through strength
ening the humanities do we, as ,i
university, get at that fundamen
tal part of human experience."
In response to the terrorist at
tacks, Long said, "kev element.*
in our country's strength are its
freedom and tolerance and diver
sity. All universities have a funda
mental role in examining and pro
moting these ideals."
After 20 years of teaching and
research, Long's transition to ad
ministration has been a sharp one.
"It was a very hard decision to
take this position [as Dean],"
Long said. I lie demands of her
new position have forced Long to
resign from her researc li position
with the Howard Hughes Med
ical Institute.
Long said her "sense of duty to
this University" stems from her
gratitude "to Stanford for giving
me a faculty position back in
1981."
Long plans to continue her re
search independent as much as
possible. In her work, which she
lias been conducting for more
than twenty veai s, Long examines
svnibiosis between soil bacteria
and plant hosts.
I lei projei t has applications in
both ecological preservation and
agricultural sec tors.
She will also continue to teach
undergraduates, this fall .is a lec
turer for the Biology core, pre
senting the lectures on nucleic ac id
biochemistry and en/yinology.
Long did undergraduate work
in bioc heniistiy and French litera
ture at ('.altech.
"When 1 was a senior, I wasn't
sure what I wanted to do," she said.
"So I took a vear out and I worked
half-time as a research technician
and half-time as a teacher, and the
combination of those two reallv

clicked, and I realized this was
what 1 wanted to do."
Long earned her doc torate in
cell and developmental biology at
Yale and did post-doctorate work
at I larval d. She was hired as an as
sociate professor at Stanford im
mediately afterward and has been
working for the University ever
since.
Students who have worked with
Long gave her positive reviews.
Senior Amy ('.how, who is major
ing in biology, took a freshman
seminar with Long during her first
quarter .it Stanford.
"She w.is not only an excellent
tea< her. but also was extremely
warm and encouraging," dhow
said.
Senior |ake Doll, a biology
major, has worked in Long's re
searc li lab since his freshman year.
"It is obvious that she . . . cares
about the intellectual develop
ment of her students," Doll said.
"She has worked c losely with me to
plan my ac ademic schedule, even
though she is not my advisor."
Several of Long's colleagues
praise her as well. (Ihemistry Prof.
|ohn Krauman, who works with
1 ong as cognizant dean of natural
sciences, said, "I've been a fan [of
her's| fora long time.
"As a leader of people . . . she's
ver\ good. She has a long record
of getting strong support for what
ever she does."
"She's terrific," said Knglish
Dept. ('.hair Robert Polhenius.
"Sharon Long is . . . what you
might call a Renaissance woman ...
She cares about it .ill and involves
herself in it all, and is c loser to hav
ing that 'all' most of us wish for: ca
reer, marriage, family . . . com
mtlnitN involvement |and| a zest
for living."
