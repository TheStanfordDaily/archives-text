The D. 12. Shaw group is a specialized investment and technology
development firm founded by a former Columbia University computer
science professor. It was created to apply quantitative and compu
tational techniques to the securities business. Today the group
encompasses a number of closely related entities with more than
US $2 billion in aggregate capital, but the core of our business remains
the same: the systems and algorithms that move hundreds of billions
of dollars a year, and the extraordinarily smart programmers and
systems architects who build them.
As you might expect in a firm largely run by computer scientists, we do
things a bit differently from the rest of the Street. We wear jeans and
sneakers. We value technology over bureaucracy. And we see to it that
good ideas get implemented.
