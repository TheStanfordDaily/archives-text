Geophysics/Earth Systems 102 (formerly
SME4). Earth, Oceans and Atmospheres
Our (hanging planet presents society with a myriad of
problems. How do global climate systems such as El
Nino work and how do natural and anthropogenic
sources of climate change affect us? Are we running
out of energy? What ore the consequences of energy
use? How does plate tectonics affect our daily lives
and what is the nature of earthquake hazards in both
California and the Bay Area? We will take a large scale
"system" approach to the solid earth, oceans and
atmospheres in order to investigate some of the key
questions that must be addressed by current and
future generations of Stonford students. For non
majors and potentiol earth scientists. Satisfies GER-2A.
