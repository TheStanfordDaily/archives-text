Dear Senior Class of 2002,
Get ready for your best year in college! In an effort to make our entire senior year memorable, we want to
let you know in advance exactly how the commencement speaker selection process works and how you can
participate.
The 2002 commencement speaker will address a crowd of 25,000 people that will include undergraduates,
graduates, alumni, families, faculty, and friends. While President Hennessy has the ultimate responsibility
to select and invite the speaker, the selection will be guided by close consultation with the Senior Class
through us, your Senior C Mass Presidents.
As the Senior Class of 2002, our role in the commencement selection process is to generate nominations,
while maintaining realistic expectations. In order for the opinions of the Senior Class to be a part of the
speaker selection process, we will present President Hennessy with a list of potential speakers. These nomi
nations will come directly from you. We believe the best way to facilitate this process is by taking nomina
tions online at http://classof2oo2.stanford.edu. This way, Seniors will be able to view all nominations, and
see what their classmates are thinking.
Yet, we should keep in mind a commencement invitation is not a mere matter ot Voting' on a website. To
speak at commencement, while an honor, requires a great deal ot work on the part ot the speaker. It is not
unusual tor an offer to be declined. A number ot factors, including whether the person has a connection to
Stanford, how busy the person is at that time of the year, and the distance the person must travel to come
to Stanford, play a role in determining whether the invitee will accept our invitation. In short, we must be
realistic and optimistic about expectations on the commencement speaker nomination. Ultimately, the
involvement ot the Class ot 2002 consists ot presenting nominations as suggestions to the President,
because in the end, the selection contains elements ot luck and timeliness.
To preserve the confidentiality ot the process and to avoid hurt feelings, President Hennessy will not reveal
the names or the rank ot the individuals who have been sent official invitations to speak. While working
with President Hennessy, we will do our best to secure someone high on our list. We promise we will update
you throughout the process, and that we will press for the speakers that you want.
Who would make an ideal commencement speaker? As your class presidents, we are seeking a speaker
whose accomplishments, experiences, and influence in the world give him or her a distinctive point ot view
from which to offer advice about issues ot consequence. We seek someone who can speak to a broad audi
ence including both undergraduate and graduate students. Further, we are looking tor someone with a mes
sage to inspire the entire Stanford community. Sometimes, these speakers tit the conventional definition ot
"famous," and sometimes they do not. Keep in mind, that a Stanford connection helps the selection
process.
In order to increase our chances ot getting our most desired speaker, the nomination process for commence
ment speaker begins today. Please visit http://classof2oo2.stanford.edu to nominate speakers. It is a user
friendly site that will also acquaint you with the Stanford Alumni Network, which will keep us connected
for the rest ot our lives. The nomination period will end on October 7th. With your input, we will do our
best to bring the speaker the senior class most wants to address us during commencement.
We wish you the best this year,
