I he agreement, though complex, is the

"The lad that we have reached this
point was due to the dedit at ion and good
will ol the participants and the hard work
of then representatives." I niversit\ Presi
dent |ohn Henness\ s.iid <it the Sept. 10
(it\ council meeting.
I lie I niversitv's development rights
were the subject of some debate. Some pre
sent at the meeting proposed that, due to
high demand, housing usage become
locked into the development agreement
which was previouslv drawn up between
the Stanford Board ol Irustees and the
c it\.
However, l.an\ I lotion, Stanford's di
rector oI government and communit\ re
lations. said that "housing remains a prior
it) and Stanford is alread) committed to a
substantial housing program." He added
that the research pat k land involved in the
rights is (urrentlv being leased.
"1 think this outlines a ver\ laii deal be
tween lour institutions that will have sub
stantial benefits lot the community," Hor
ton said. "All patties worked together fin
the common good."
I lennessv also said most of the develop
ment rights w ill probably not be used in the
forseeable future.
I he planning commission and the (it\
council must still hold an environmental
review and public hearings with regards to
the approved memorandum.
