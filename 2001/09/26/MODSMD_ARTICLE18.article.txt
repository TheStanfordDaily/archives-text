Irotn us bx a faceless, nationless group
whoseonh put pose was to stt ike let tot in
the hearts ol Anient .ins and somehow di
minish the spirit, resolve and confidence
ol our gieat nation.
In the interveningda\ s. as Ainei it a has
wept, we aie beginning to see the xvax sin
xvhich the countn has heen transformed.
As the dust settles, what is einei giug is just
as nefarious and damaging as the
tragedies in New York. Washington.
D C., .md IVtinsvlvania: 1 he nation is
being swept by an epidemic ol hate.
In Mesa, An/., a gunman shot .it twogas
stations and a house Saturdax afternoon,
killing theow net of one of the stores. Manx
believe thai Balbii Singh Sodhi. 19, ihevic
litn ol the first shooting, was killed betause

I n fat t., B.libit Singh was a Sikh, a mem
ber ola world religion started in India
over 500 vcars ago xvith over 20 million
followers wot Itlw it It • Sikhs believe in one
(iod common to all mankind. Sikhism

In the past (our da\ s, there have been
over r>o incidents ol attacks on Sikh
Americans ranging from verbal alterca
tions to shootings; homes, businesses
and temples have been firebombed and
nianx Sikhs have been assaulted, threat
ened .mil intimidated.
Add to this the attac ksth.it have taken
place against cl.u k skinned ot bearded
members ol the Muslim, \rab, Hindu,
( hristian and |exvish ((immunities in
everx cornel ol tins great nation, and
x ou will agree that this is nothing short of
an epidemic of hatred, pitting \merican
against Americ an.
1 bring xou this message because il is
time for this senseless violence to end be
fore another innocent person loses his oi
her lile. We all must unite toxv.ud the
goal ol healing oiu great nation and not
lose track ol America's foundation in
freedom and justice. If Ave do not all do
our part to stop this senseless violence,
then the terrorists will have won.
As a Sikh American, I wish xou all
s.iletx and strength as we prepare lor the
hard times ahead.
