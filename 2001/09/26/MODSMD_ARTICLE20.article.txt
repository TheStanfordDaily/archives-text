At Stanford, though, inexperi

When experiencr mixes well with

Deleiiivelv, Stanford did not
snflot ai Boston College and Ai i
/ona Site in its first two games, but
ii has een steady in making op
portuistic plays.
W ie. remarkably in onl\ Ins
secoii year at linebac ker, has cov
erecthe whole field and leads the
CatOnal in tackles. He also
billed ,i punt against Boston ( ol-
Ict to spark Stanford's defense.
A lot ol what we're doing de
feMvely is based on what Coy can
d/' said defensive coordinator
l*nt Baer.
"He's probably the strongest
(aver on the team. No question,

he is an honors candidate this sea
son. I le's one of the best defensive
players in our conference."
In the secondary. Williams pa
trols the defensive backlield with
the si/e of a linebacker and the
speed of a corner"back. In addition
to delivering some crushing hits
against Arizona State last week.
Williams also intercepted Sun
Devil quarterback )efl Krohn's
pass in the third quarter, a pla\
that seemed to dellate Arizona
State's offense.

"I wish we had about 12 Tanks
on our team," secondary-* coach
I )ennv Sc luilei said earlier this sea
son. "I le is c learlv a big time, NFL
player."
I hough the defensive line ina\
not have raw talents like W ire and
Williams, n lias plaved well togeth
er thus far into the season. Seniors
Austin Lee and Marcus Hoover
and juniors Matt Leonard and
I re\ Freeman helped the Cardinal
hold the Sun Devils last week to
only 84 vards rushing and one for

14 on third-down conversions.
In Stanford's season opener
against Boston College, the defen
sive line contained William Creen
to only 103 yards of i ushing, which
was by far the defensive ke\ of the
game. Creen had exploded for
more than 200 yards the week be
fore against West Virginia.
In the offensive treiu lies, I leit
maiin anchors a unit that should
get better throughout the season.
Heitmann, sophomore Kwame
Harris — regarded as a budding

superstar — and seniors Greg
Sthindler, Xack Quaccia and Kirk
Chambers have opened up holes
lor running back senior Brian
Allen and junior Kerry Carter
while proteeting Fasani.
"No matter what you say about
football, it's going to be won up
front." Willingham said. "If you're
.1 passing team and vou can't pro
tect the passer, then vou don't have
.1 thane e. 1 1 you're a running team.


Y LEE/The Stanfoic:
As a sophomore, standout free safety Tank Williams was a memeber of the 1999 Rose Bowl squad. Now, as a senior, Williams is a leader of the 2001
team, using the experience that he has gained throughout his time here on the Farm.
