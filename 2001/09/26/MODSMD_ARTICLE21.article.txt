rowers and below) as an emerging
sport in tl.is 2001-02 season and a lull
varsity sport by next season. The new
rowing program is the 18th women s
intercollegiate varsity program within
the athletic department.
"We are convinced of the tremen
dous interest on our campus for
women's lightweight rowing." Leland
said in a department press release.
"We are excited to add it as our 34th
intercollegiate program."
Coaching this new program will be
Al Acosta, who has had successlul ex
perience coaching at the Oakland
Strokes club program since 1994.
While Acosta's team will compete
in the Pacific Conference this season,
it will not participate in NCAA com
petition yet. Instead, the team will
participate in the Intercollegiate
Rowing Association's national cham
pionship in the spring. Ihe NCAA
has deemed lightweight rowing an
"emerging sport.'
The team is expected to face a
schedule of seven or eight events this
year, including races against regional
rivals such as California and UC-Davis.

It will also compete in the San Diego
( rcw (".lassie.
I he new team will be composed al
most entirely of walk-ons.
"Whoever wants to row will have an
opportunity to do it." said Acosta. "A
boat can hold nine women, but the
squad can accommodate many more
rowers than the requisite nine."
As ,i program, crew is relatively un
usual in that the teams depend mostly
on walk-ons. Ihe program has ex
panded considerably in the last few
vears, with the addition ol new teams
and coaches.
Crew also anticipates the imminent
construction of a new boathouse,
scheduled to be completed next sea
son. I he program is looking for more
Stanford students and athletes to per
petuate its growth and success.
"[Crew] is a real great sport when
put together with the Stanford student
profile," said crew director and men's
head coach Craig Amerkhanian. "It
takes focus and it takes intensity and
it's fun."
An informational meeting for cur
rent and prospective athletes to kick
oil the- 2001-02 season will be held this
1 hursday evening in kissic k .Auditori
um in Arrillaga family sports complex
at 7 p.m.
I lie crew program finished strong
last year. The men's varsity finished
12th and the women's varsity finished
19th. Acosta is aware of the success his
new team will have to follow.
"The program is pretty much in
place; we just have to focus on building
a team." Acosta said about the goals he
has for women's lightweight rowing
this season. "There are some team
building things we need to do and es
tablish some traditions that have never
been there before."
