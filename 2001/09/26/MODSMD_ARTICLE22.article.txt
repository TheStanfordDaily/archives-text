# Tragedy spurs NY Mets
## 
### 
Like many a baseball
season, this 2001 sea
son has been chock
(till of ama/ing sto
ries like Barn Bonds pursuit
of the 70 homernn mai k and
absolute Ichiro Mania u|> in

.Vat tk\ How
ever, in m\
view, these
stories pale in
comparison
to thi- New
York Nlets'
current surge
from the*
depths <>l the

National League l ast into the
midst of a pennant race in the
wake of the tragech of Sep
tember 11th.
1 may be a little biased as a
native New Yorker and a life
long Met fan. but this ston of
a down-and-out team, pulling
it all together to bring some
nun h-needed jo\ anddistrai -
tion to its bereaved fans-anil
city in general-just seems too
good to be true.
In their last 28 games, the
Mets have gone 22-0 to < limb
all the way up to four games
out of first place, where the
Braves and Phillies remain
tied as of I'uesday.
For those of you who don't
follow baseball, or the Mets,
too closely, up until one
month ago this season had
been as much of a disaster as
could be seemingh possible
for the reigning National
League Champion Mets. I lie
team was under the .500
mark for pretty mm li the en
tire season, while the local
media bashed the team daily
and belittled management
for what seemed to be ab
solutely inane player moves,
such as the free agent sign
ings of Steve I rai lisel and


Mac Levine
Kevin Appier, and the team's
choice to remove itself Iron) the
Alex Rodriguez sweepstakes. At
tendance was down from last sea
son. as the Mets |iist tried to stav
ahead ol the low I \ Iwpos and out
ot the di\ isi< mi (ellai.
However, In August the team
had l>eguu to turn things around
little by little. Steve I rai lisel start
ed throwing like a Major League
pitc her, Re\ Ordonez, started hit
ting like somewhat of a Major
league hittei and Mike Piazza
continued to earn the team on his
gargantuan shoulders. On Au
gust 18th, alter losing seven
straight games and dropping to
13 I 2 games out of first place, the
Mets began to make their move,
taking two ol three from the
Dodgers and the Rockies and
then sweeping the (■iants.
IK the now-infamous date of
Sept. 1 1, 2001. the Mets had won
seven straight series and stood
only 8 I 2 games behind the
Braves, although no one reallv
seemed to notice. However, on
that da\ everything changed
around the globe, and the baseball
world screeched to a one-week
halt as Commissioner Hud Selig
canceled si\ dass ol games.
When games resumed the next
week .md the Mets took the field
;it PN( Park in Pittsburgh, count
less eyes around the country were
now lot used on these players in
their \YPI) and I DM hats, as
everyone pondered bow tliev
would respond to the traged\ and
represent the < ii\ that adorned
their jersevs.
I in\sell was sitting in m\ room
it home in New Yoi k ( it\. waiting

in anticipation as Fox Sports
began the telecast by showing the
singing of the National Anthem,
which they usually ignore in favor
of commercials.
However, this game was obvi
ously not normal. Although the
horrible tragedy of the terrorist
attack was felt ac ross the country,
it undoubtedlv affected those in
tlu- New York and D.C. areas the
most, and the Mets took the field
that night with the heaw hearts
that all New Yorkers now have.
Yet tliev also had the responsibil
it\ and opportunity to represent
their c it\ well and do justice to
the true heroes whose hats they
sported.
I hat night, the Mets went out
and passed their test, beating the
Pirates l-l as they scored three
runs in the top of the ninth inning.
I motions were definitely mixed as
the team absorbed their victory in
the (lubhou.se.
Mark |olmson, the 6'7" first
baseman, who delivered the
game-winning two-run double,
openly wept in front ol cameras,
unable to control all that had been
bottled inside for the past week;
reliever and native New Yorker
|ohn Franco, who picked up the
win. t( »ld reporters that he was out
on the mound against his will, and
that he was onlv out there to clo
what he could to belter the situa
tion for am Met fans and New
York as aw hole.
I'he Mets went on to win their
next two games in Pittsburgh, as
their emotions grew little In little
into a waterfall ol momentum.
Watching these three games, one
could see the Mets were playing
with .i determination tb.it the Pi
rates i onld just not match, and the
thought of the team returning to
Shea Stadium on Fridav to face,
the Braves was just awesome.

On Wednesday, the organiza
tion announced that certain cere
monies would be held before and
during the game to honor the city
and celebrate the unbelievably
brave city workers, so 1 just knew
Shea would be roc king.
And it was. Amidst all the talk of
security issues and stadiums being
possible terrorist targets, 41,235
fans came out that night to see the
Mets battle the Braves, whom they
now trailed by only 5 1/2 games.
This is the point where the story
seems just too good to be true, too
"Hollywood" to actually have
taken place. Diana Ross began
with a stirring rendition of"Ckxl
Bless America" that left all those in
attendance both weeping with sad
ness .md cheering with joy, while
the singing of Marc Anthony and a
bagpipe performance followed.
I lowever, the tribute came to a
climax as the mayor of New York,
Rudy Ciuiliani, stepped onto the
field, and the cheers seemed to
come from everywhere. (luiliani, a
life-long Yankee fan, has been
booed at every Met game that he
has attended at Shea.
, However this night was differ
ent, and ever)' single fan in the
stands knew it. Rudy received the
largest ovation of all, a level of
cheering that would only be sur
passed once during the night.
As the thirty-minute tribute
ended, in an impromptu displa\
of emotion, members of the Mets
and the Braves embraced each
other in the middle of the dia
mond, hugging as Americans just
moments before they battled as
baseball players.
Once the game finally began,
the teams remained tied 1-1 until
the eighth inning, when tlu-
Braves took a 2-1 lead in the top
hall of the inning. Just a half-hour
after Liza Minelli serenaded the

crowd with the classic "New York.
New York," the Mets came to bat
down a run. With one out, and
pinch runner Desi Relaford at lii st
base, Mike Piazza sauntered up to
the plate, with a chance t<> take the
lead against the hard-throwing
Brave reliever, Steve karsay.
What more could vou ask for? Pi
azza, as much of a symbol of New
York as am professional athlete
today, up with 4C),000-p lus
screaming .it the top oftheir lungs,
waving signs that read "Let's (>o
Mets" side-by-side with signs that
read "(«od Bless America."
For those of vou that either
don't alreadx know or can't figure
it out. Piazza sent the karsax pitch
over the center-field fence, fora
mammoth, game-xvinning two
run homer, as Armando Benitez
closed out the game for the Mets in
the ninth inning. If you think \<>u
could xvrite a more picturesque,
absolutely perfect x\.i\ for this
game to end, I dare vou to trx.
Altei the win. which brought
the Mets |iist 1 I J games out of
first place, Piazza told reporters.
"I'm just so happx 1 gave the peo
ple something to < heei about.
There x\.is a lot of emotion li was
just a surreal sort of energx out
there. I'm jusi so proud to be a
part of it tonight."
So now the Mets haxe entered
the final stretch of the season,
oulx four games out wit li 12 to
plax, including three more
against the Braves. As I'm writing
this. I ask vou to xvatch out for mx
Mets .md root loi them, and not
just because mx heart is siill heal
ing after last season's World Se
ries loss. Root for them so thex
can xvin just .i lew more games,
and trulx gixe New York some
thing to cheer about.
