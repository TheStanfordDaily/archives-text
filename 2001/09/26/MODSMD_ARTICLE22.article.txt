# Tragedy spurs NY Mets
## 
### 
Like many a baseball
season, this 2001 sea
son has been chock
(till of ama/ing sto
ries like Barn Bonds pursuit
of the 70 homernn mai k and
absolute Ichiro Mania u|> in

.Vat tk\ How
ever, in m\
view, these
stories pale in
comparison
to thi- New
York Nlets'
current surge
from the*
depths <>l the

National League l ast into the
midst of a pennant race in the
wake of the tragech of Sep
tember 11th.
1 may be a little biased as a
native New Yorker and a life
long Met fan. but this ston of
a down-and-out team, pulling
it all together to bring some
nun h-needed jo\ anddistrai -
tion to its bereaved fans-anil
city in general-just seems too
good to be true.
In their last 28 games, the
Mets have gone 22-0 to < limb
all the way up to four games
out of first place, where the
Braves and Phillies remain
tied as of I'uesday.
For those of you who don't
follow baseball, or the Mets,
too closely, up until one
month ago this season had
been as much of a disaster as
could be seemingh possible
for the reigning National
League Champion Mets. I lie
team was under the .500
mark for pretty mm li the en
tire season, while the local
media bashed the team daily
and belittled management
for what seemed to be ab
solutely inane player moves,
such as the free agent sign
ings of Steve I rai lisel and


Mac Levine
