## Why & how the World Trade Towers collapsed 
### DEBBIE BEREBICHEZ 
In the 1900s, Minoru Yamasaki, architect
of the World trade Center, expressed the
founding philosophy behind its construction.
" 1 he World I rade (lenter should, because
of its importance, "become a living represen
tation of man's belief in humanity, his need
for individual dignity, Ins belief in the coop
eration of men and through this cooperation
his ability to find greatness," he said in his
book Architects on Architecture: New Direc
tions in America
On September 11 of 2001, barely l M) years
after they opened, the twin towers were lost to
a terrorist attack.
I o all of us who watched the images of the
two planes hitting the North and South tow
ers of the I rade center complex, ii was clear
that the structures were critically compro
mised, but perhaps few understood thai this
was a fatal blow. It should be noted that the
towers withstood the attack long enough for
thousands of people to escape from the even
tual collapse of the buildings.
The north tower was hit at 8:45 a.m. and
did not crumble until 10:29 a.m.; the south
tower did not fall until 57 minutes after it was
hit. However, at the time, the buildings' im
minent collapse was not obvious. Since the
event was unprecedented — no other skv
scraper had ever been hit by an airplane of
this si/e — the outcome would have been

hard to predict by anyone. Indeed, there is
still some debate and ongoing investigation
about the vvav in which the towers collapsed
after the airplanes crashed.
When the two towers were built, engineers
John Skilling and Les Robertson used tin*
novel structural design of a rigid "hollow

tube" formed In steel columns separated by
22 inches each; tins constituted the perimeter
of the building.
In the "spine" of the building, there was an
internal lift core used for elevators. I he floors

were made of prefabricated missel steel span
ning the distance from the perimeter to the
core. Ihe impact of tlie plane crash destroyed
a substantial number of perimeter columns
on several floors of the building, gravely dam
aging the system. (Fig. 1)
rhe fire that started inside the building as
a consequence of the explosion affected the
physical properties of the surviving steel
columns. It is speculated that temperatures
on the inside of the building reached 1000 de
grees Fahrenheit, at which point steel starts
behaving like plastic. Above this temperature,
the strength and stiffness ol steel decrease sig
nificantly. in this case causing the perimeter
columns to buckle outwards. (Fig. 2)
Inevitably, once the columns supporting a
floor weaken, the whole uppei structure col
lapses at the level of impact, causing all floors
above it to fall onto the lowei still-standing
structure. (Fig. !$) Since the resulting collapse
is such a huge mass, it begins to gain gigantic
momentum and crushes all the floors below
it, one by one. This is called "telescoping
mode."
A question being asked is whether the ter
rorists knew in advance that the towers would
fall and, if so, in what manner. I lad the towers
tipped over rather than collapsed onto them
selves, many more lives could have been lost
and several blocks of lowei Manhattan wiped

a possible explanation.
I he telescoping mode of
tailing began first, and there wasn't
enough time tor the tipping over
mode to develop," Ixtughlin said.
I he moment of inertia of a
long thin tower is extremely
large, so it takes .i long time for it
to tip ovei before it crushes one
o! the Moors beneath the top. But
once the temperature-weakened
steel lost its strength, the top
floors were essentialh set to

112 reef all, and ii look the same
amount of time (approximately
Tight seconds) for them to fall to
the ground as it would have
taken, for example, a metal coin.
1 his is because at the time the top
floors started falling, the struc
tural forces holding the rest ol
the building up were too small to
change the large momentum of
the mass falling onto them. As a
result, the floors came right
down like a stack of pancakes,
one on lop of the other.
"It was as if the top of the
building was acting like a huge
pile driver, c rashing clown onto
the floors underneath," said
structural engineer Chris Wise.
In general, engineers can pre
dict the outcomes of bridges falling,

t<)\\ cis c <>llapsing (>r any other cata
strophe based on .in a posteriori

.uc then able to build stronger and
better structures to prevent such
disasters from happening again.
For the collapse of the twin
towers, however, there was no
precedent. Furthermore, there
was little that engineers could
have done to prevent buildings
from falling in the face of terrorist
attacks of such a large magnitude.
Consequently, while the
knowledge gained from these in
vestigations will help us build
structures that are better
equipped to withstand potential
future catastrophes, it is equally
important that we trv to prevent
terrorism at its roots.

In the 1900s, Minoru Yamasaki, architect
of the World trade Center, expressed the
founding philosophy behind its construction.
" 1 he World I rade (lenter should, because
of its importance, "become a living represen
tation of man's belief in humanity, his need
for individual dignity, Ins belief in the coop
eration of men and through this cooperation
his ability to find greatness," he said in his
book Architects on Architecture: New Direc
tions in America
On September 11 of 2001, barely l M) years
after they opened, the twin towers were lost to
a terrorist attack.
I o all of us who watched the images of the
two planes hitting the North and South tow
ers of the I rade center complex, ii was clear
that the structures were critically compro
mised, but perhaps few understood thai this
was a fatal blow. It should be noted that the
towers withstood the attack long enough for
thousands of people to escape from the even
tual collapse of the buildings.
The north tower was hit at 8:45 a.m. and
did not crumble until 10:29 a.m.; the south
tower did not fall until 57 minutes after it was
hit. However, at the time, the buildings' im
minent collapse was not obvious. Since the
event was unprecedented — no other skv
scraper had ever been hit by an airplane of
this si/e — the outcome would have been

hard to predict by anyone. Indeed, there is
still some debate and ongoing investigation
about the vvav in which the towers collapsed
after the airplanes crashed.
When the two towers were built, engineers
John Skilling and Les Robertson used tin*
novel structural design of a rigid "hollow

tube" formed In steel columns separated by
22 inches each; tins constituted the perimeter
of the building.
In the "spine" of the building, there was an
internal lift core used for elevators. I he floors

were made of prefabricated missel steel span
ning the distance from the perimeter to the
core. Ihe impact of tlie plane crash destroyed
a substantial number of perimeter columns
on several floors of the building, gravely dam
aging the system. (Fig. 1)
rhe fire that started inside the building as
a consequence of the explosion affected the
physical properties of the surviving steel
columns. It is speculated that temperatures
on the inside of the building reached 1000 de
grees Fahrenheit, at which point steel starts
behaving like plastic. Above this temperature,
the strength and stiffness ol steel decrease sig
nificantly. in this case causing the perimeter
columns to buckle outwards. (Fig. 2)
Inevitably, once the columns supporting a
floor weaken, the whole uppei structure col
lapses at the level of impact, causing all floors
above it to fall onto the lowei still-standing
structure. (Fig. !$) Since the resulting collapse
is such a huge mass, it begins to gain gigantic
momentum and crushes all the floors below
it, one by one. This is called "telescoping
mode."
A question being asked is whether the ter
rorists knew in advance that the towers would
fall and, if so, in what manner. I lad the towers
tipped over rather than collapsed onto them
selves, many more lives could have been lost
and several blocks of lowei Manhattan wiped

out. Why didn't c 1 it* towers tip over

a possible explanation.
I he telescoping mode of
tailing began first, and there wasn't
enough time tor the tipping over
mode to develop," Ixtughlin said.
I he moment of inertia of a
long thin tower is extremely
large, so it takes .i long time for it
to tip ovei before it crushes one
o! the Moors beneath the top. But
once the temperature-weakened
steel lost its strength, the top
floors were essentialh set to

112 reef all, and ii look the same
amount of time (approximately
Tight seconds) for them to fall to
the ground as it would have
taken, for example, a metal coin.
1 his is because at the time the top
floors started falling, the struc
tural forces holding the rest ol
the building up were too small to
change the large momentum of
the mass falling onto them. As a
result, the floors came right
down like a stack of pancakes,
one on lop of the other.
"It was as if the top of the
building was acting like a huge
pile driver, c rashing clown onto
the floors underneath," said
structural engineer Chris Wise.
