## Why & how the World Trade Towers collapsed 
### DEBBIE BEREBICHEZ 
In the 1900s, Minoru Yamasaki, architect
of the World trade Center, expressed the
founding philosophy behind its construction.
" 1 he World I rade (lenter should, because
of its importance, "become a living represen
tation of man's belief in humanity, his need
for individual dignity, Ins belief in the coop
eration of men and through this cooperation
his ability to find greatness," he said in his
book Architects on Architecture: New Direc
tions in America
On September 11 of 2001, barely l M) years
after they opened, the twin towers were lost to
a terrorist attack.
I o all of us who watched the images of the
two planes hitting the North and South tow
ers of the I rade center complex, ii was clear
that the structures were critically compro
mised, but perhaps few understood thai this
was a fatal blow. It should be noted that the
towers withstood the attack long enough for
thousands of people to escape from the even
tual collapse of the buildings.
The north tower was hit at 8:45 a.m. and
did not crumble until 10:29 a.m.; the south
tower did not fall until 57 minutes after it was
hit. However, at the time, the buildings' im
minent collapse was not obvious. Since the
event was unprecedented — no other skv
scraper had ever been hit by an airplane of
this si/e — the outcome would have been

hard to predict by anyone. Indeed, there is
still some debate and ongoing investigation
about the vvav in which the towers collapsed
after the airplanes crashed.
When the two towers were built, engineers
John Skilling and Les Robertson used tin*
novel structural design of a rigid "hollow

tube" formed In steel columns separated by
22 inches each; tins constituted the perimeter
of the building.
In the "spine" of the building, there was an
internal lift core used for elevators. I he floors

were made of prefabricated missel steel span
ning the distance from the perimeter to the
core. Ihe impact of tlie plane crash destroyed
a substantial number of perimeter columns
on several floors of the building, gravely dam
aging the system. (Fig. 1)
rhe fire that started inside the building as
a consequence of the explosion affected the
physical properties of the surviving steel
columns. It is speculated that temperatures
on the inside of the building reached 1000 de
grees Fahrenheit, at which point steel starts
behaving like plastic. Above this temperature,
the strength and stiffness ol steel decrease sig
nificantly. in this case causing the perimeter
columns to buckle outwards. (Fig. 2)
Inevitably, once the columns supporting a
floor weaken, the whole uppei structure col
lapses at the level of impact, causing all floors
above it to fall onto the lowei still-standing
structure. (Fig. !$) Since the resulting collapse
is such a huge mass, it begins to gain gigantic
momentum and crushes all the floors below
it, one by one. This is called "telescoping
mode."
A question being asked is whether the ter
rorists knew in advance that the towers would
fall and, if so, in what manner. I lad the towers
tipped over rather than collapsed onto them
selves, many more lives could have been lost
and several blocks of lowei Manhattan wiped
