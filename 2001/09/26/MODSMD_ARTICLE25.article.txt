Did Honest Abe overdose on
mercury? Turns out Abraham Lin
coln not only suffered from depres
sion and slight gigantism, bin might
also have been poisoned by mer
cury. According to retired physician
and medical sleuth Norbert
Hirschhorn, Lincoln tried to combat
melancholia using the then com
mon "blue mass." The medication
contained 40 times as much mer
cury as what doctors say is the cur
rent safe limit, causing insomnia,
tremors and potential madness. Lin
coln stopped taking the pills in 18(» 1,
five months into his presidency.
So you liked the polygraph

The human genome was mapped
successfully last December, to great media excite
ment. What may have a more revolutionary impact,
though, is mapping the human proteome. Whereas
the genome lists all genes, the proteome contains the
proteins derived from those sequences. Researchers
at Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City announced this
year they will sequence the human proteome, expect
ed to have between 300,000 and 400,000 sequences
within the next three years. The bold assertion has
met wjth skepticism, but some think it is possible —
after all, Celera Inc. finished sequencing the 30,000
genes in the Human Genome two years earlier than
predicted.

According to Tim Berners-Lee, who created the
world wide web and now coordinates it, the new

the word, but also by what it means. Which means

So you liked the polygraph
(AKA the lie detector) in "Meet the
Parents." How does the polygraph
work? In the past two years the De
partment of Defense has stepped
up research on alternative tech-

nologies through studies coordinated l»\

its Polygraph Institute at Fort

Jackson, SC.. The newest

technique is "thermal
imaging," which moni-

results indicate an 80 to 90
percent accuracy rate.

Now that we have discovered everything in the
Solar System, scientists better start exploring out
side it, right? Wrong. Researchers reported in July

die discovery of 12 new moons on Saturn, ranging
from (j to :V2 kilometers in diameter. 1 here are ongo
ing efforts to find an ocean underneath the icy surface
of Kuropa, Jupiter's third largest moon. And then
there are those that believe a tenth planet in the solar

system exists. It seems the solar sys
tem still may have many secrets to
offer...
Here are some interesting
facts on the greenhouse effect:
Fact: We are emitting 8 billion tons
of carbon each year.
Fact: Most of this pollution goes
straight into the atmosphere.
Fact: Efforts in the last 20 years have
reduced the rate of increase, hut
numbers are still growing.
Fact: Plants, along with microbes
and invertebrates in soil, pro
duce nearly two billion tons of
carbon a year.

The human genome was mapped
successfully last December, to great media excite
ment. What may have a more revolutionary impact,
though, is mapping the human proteome. Whereas
the genome lists all genes, the proteome contains the
proteins derived from those sequences. Researchers
at Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City announced this
year they will sequence the human proteome, expect
ed to have between 300,000 and 400,000 sequences
within the next three years. The bold assertion has
met wjth skepticism, but some think it is possible —
after all, Celera Inc. finished sequencing the 30,000
genes in the Human Genome two years earlier than
predicted.
Look at any computer on campus and you will
see everyone using only one search engine:
Google. Google created a revolution by showing hits
according to how many links it has, effectively allow
ing the Net to police itself. However, a new revolu
tion might be on the way: a semantic search engine.
According to Tim Berners-Lee, who created the
world wide web and now coordinates it, the new
generation of search engines will not only look for
the word, but also by what it means. Which means



that typing in "cock'" and setting
certain parameters might return
sites on computer code, postal
code or even secrets.
Mad Cow Disease has taken its
toll on the U.K. Since the first
deaths in 1995, about 100 people
have succumbed to the disease.
Between 1980 and 1990, 750,000
infected cattle were slaughtered.
