The automobile in
dustry has been invest
ing millions in re
searching fuel cells be
cause they are super
clean, turning hydro
gen into power and
leaving only water be
hind. But fuel cell cars
won't be out until at
least 2004; Aprilia's
fuel cell bike, however.

lets you sample the technology sooner. Inspired by
E.TVs flying bike, Aprilia's unit can go up to 20
mph. Although a bit fancy for campus, if you can
get over the $2,000 price tag. this may be the
dream hike for you. Available in 2003.

For all you frosh looking
fora plat e on the Cardinal bas
ketball team. Festo may just
have the power boots that you
need. The pneumatic tube on
the back of their prototype
Airhopper Sport Shoe contracts
like a muscle, propelling you
upward a few feet. The bad

news is that the shoes are still very much in the de
velopment stage. If you can't stand the wait, Nike's
$150 Shox can give you a less spectacular bounce
in a tidier package.

Who can ever get
enough of military
toys? The Marine
Corps' newest de
velopment — the
Super Cobra AH-1Z
helicopter — has ad
vanced electro-optic
sensors that enable
reconnaissance mis
sions well beyond
the range of an

enemy's missiles. It also features state-of-the-art
four-blade rotors made of composite materials,
which increase the helicopter's range and ability.
As for venom, the Cobra carries eight Hellfire mis
siles, 14 rockets and 650 rounds of ammo.
Economic, yet sexy — that's the idea behind the
Smart Roadster, which is being billed as the perfect
date car. Its aggressive profile is guaranteed to im
press that special someone, and GO miles to the gal
lon means you can allord to drive her wherever
her heart desires. Although there are no marketing
plans for the U.S. as of yet, the Roadster will be on
sale in Europe in 2003.
