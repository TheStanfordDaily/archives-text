A SECOND ARTIFICIAL HEART
On |uly 2 surgeons at Jewish Hospital in
Louisville, Kentucky implanted the world's first
self-contained artificial heart into 50 year old
Robert Tools. On Sept. 13, they announced they
had perfoi nied the pro< edure on a second patient,
70 year old Tom ('.ln isterson.
Abionied Inc. of Danvers, Mass. manufactures
the plastic and titanium AbioCor heart device.
I he company has approval Irom federal regula
tors to test the device on five patients, whi< hit ex
pects to do by year's end. Only non-heart trans
plant candidates with less than a month to li\e are
considered.
Initial estimates were that the- heart could give
recipients approximately one more month ol life,
but Tools has already surpassed and continues to
do well. Just one week after the operation, Chris
terson was already walking.

This past Wednesday, it was announced that a
surgical team at New York's Mount Sinai Medical

The gall bladder operation was conducted by
