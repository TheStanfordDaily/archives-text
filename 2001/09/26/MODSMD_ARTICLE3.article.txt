# SLE moves to east Flo Mo residences
## 
### JENNIE KIM 
For as long as anyone can re
member, Structured Liberal
Education students have
resided in the west houses of
Florence Moore Hall, occupy
ing Paloma, Mirlo and Loro,
with non-SI.I students occupy
ing the remaining lour dorms in
the building.
However, this year the SLF
and non-Sl.l* students at Flo Mo
have undergone .» flip-flop of
sorts, and over SO SI F students
now live in the east houses of
Alondra, ('.arclenal and Faisan.
Fhe SLF curriculum, accord
ing to its founder and faculty di
rector, I listory Prof. Mark Man
call, originated in the east hous
es of Flo Mo dining the late
19705. However, as SLF. stu
dents were assigned to all dorms
throughout Flo Mo, the pro
gram spread to both sides of the
residence.
Over a decade ago, the resi
dent fellow for the west houses,
Fd Free, took on the responsi
bilitv of overseeing SLF. Subse
quently, all the west houses ex
cept Gavilan became the SLF.

residences.
However, when Free chose
to leave the program at the end
of last year, his departure left
Mam all and other faculty in
volved with SLF programming
with some decisions to make.
Fhey had already noticed
that SLE students in the west
houses appeared to be experi
encing "stigmati/ation" from
the non-SLE residents also liv
ing in the west houses, accord
ing to Dr. James ('.art", Rl for
Flo Mo's east houses.
Due to the fact that onl\ one
of the west houses was not occu
pied bv SLF. residents, the ar
rangment led to "social divi
sions" between SLF and non-
SLE students, Carr said.
"A small-town mentality was
created where the other stu
dents didn't realize the cool
tilings about SI.E," he said.
Mancall and his colleagues
felt that if SLE was moved to the
east houses of Flo Mo, the rift
with the odd dorm out could be
avoided, as there are only three
east dorms.
I hey also believed that (lie
close proximity of the Musii De
partment to the east houses
would help increase the accessi
bility «ind appreciation of the arts
to the students participating in
the- SLK program.
I he decision to move was a
unanimous one among the SI.K
directors, but one major obstacle
remained in their path: they had
to find a new RK to succeed Free.
1 hey first approached tlu-( in -
tent RFs ol the e.ist dorms, Dr.
James ('.an and Jennifer Lane.
I he pair had been serving as
RFs ol Flo Mo for the past three
vcars and said they were more

lat ge ta>k ol leading the concen

I he new SLK RFs hope to "re

move the stigmati/.ation of SLK"
by enacting the move.
"Jennifer and 1 very much
want SLK and non-SLF students
to associate, and we are directing
our programming to help them
get to know each other and get
rid of the fake divisions," Can
said.
About half of those in the three
east dorms are SLK students, and
almost .ill share a room with a
non-SLK student.
Not onlv will this arrangement
help integrate both groups of stu
dents, the heightened role of
music and the performing arts in
the program will also "allow the
Rl 's to have more interaction
with the students," according to
Mancall.
