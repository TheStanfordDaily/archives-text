"It's the signal of the fu

Programming is broadc ast to

satellites and then to radio re
ceivers. Ihe signal can be
blocked by tall buildings, so
ground transmitters will repeat
the signal in urban areas. Some
receivers can be used in both
autos and in homes.
Lor autos, a new satellite
stereo svsteni costs about $ 100,
said Stephen Cook, senior vice
president of sales and market
ing. But most stores that sell ra
dios also sell satellite receivers
that work with any existing car
stereo.
Ihe Pioneer Universal re
ceiver, a cigar-sized box with a
remote control that shows the
name ol the song and the artist,
runs about $250. A small anten
na that sits on the vehicle's roof
can cost, up to $79.
Another option is the Sony
Plug and Play lor about $300.
The size of a radar detec tor, it
can be removed from its plastic
holder and used in a home
stereo system. Cook said.
The satellite companies have
t he ambitious goal of signing up
more than four million sub
scribers each in the next four
years to break even. Sirius will
charge $12.95 monthly and
offer more commercial-free
programming.''
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
analyst Vijayjavant said success
depends on how committed au
tomakers are to installing the
saiellite-recei\ ing radios in their
vehicles.
General Motors Corp., which
has invested $120 million in
XM. plans to offer the radios as
a factory-installed option iri
some 2002 Cadillacs and in 20
models the next year. The sub
scription can be included in the
car's financing.

Sirius and plan to oiler the ra
