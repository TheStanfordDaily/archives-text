# Hennessy: Attacks pose new challenges
## President discusses hate crimes, Bio-X funding decision 
### ANUJ GUPTA EDITORIAL STAFF 
I lie Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks on
the I S., and the seemingly immi
nent war into which they have
drawn the nation, will not merely
be the primary issue on the minds
of Stanford's leaders during the
academic year that begins today,
said I niversitv President John
I lennessy.
"I think 11ii> will !>e the defining
issue of your generation,'' I lennessy
said, during a wide-ranging inter
view with f'he Daily in his Building
10 office yesterday afternoon.

impact of the attacks on Stanford
to human c loning and embryonic

but focused on leading Stanford
through one of the most tumul
tuous periods in American history.
Terror produces new challenges
I lennessy said the sheer enormi
ty of the attack and its aftermath
poses perhaps the most significant
challenge to Stanford as it attempts

to begin a new year smoothly.
" The [attack] has taken every
body's attention away from every
thing else," he s.iid. "Managing
that and trying to get everybody
back to something that resembles
normal life is going to be key, but
the world does go on."
Still, while Hcnnessy said secu
rity measures will inevitably esca
late and "we'll all have to be 011 our
toes" .is a result of the attacks, he
stressed that daily life at the I ni
versity ought not to be significantly
altered.

agenda for how we want to work as

portant" to "strongly and immedi
ately" denounce acts of hate direct
ed toward Muslims and Arab-
Americans — .md in part it ular the
"hate e-mails' sent to Islamic stu
dent groups at Stanford — be
cause the p.issii »ns and emotions of
the general public were so in

Opportunities for activism,
education
I lie forthcoming I .S. military
response to the events of Sept. 11 is
sure to spark a wave of at ti\ ism and
political engagement among Stan
ford's noloriousl\ dispassionate
student body not seen since the
Vietnam War protests on campus,
according to I lenness\.
"This probabh will generate a
lot more interest about tbe ques
tions of how to balance peat e and
security, how to balance freedom
and individual rights, how to put
an emphasis on justice rather than
on vengeance." be s.iid.
Hennessv added that, in mam
ways, tbe current situation is
"much more difficult" because,
while there was widespread agree
ment that the I S. engagement in
Vietnam was wrong, the moral im
plications of the comingconflii t are
more ambiguous.
" There's been a c rime commit
ted .igainst Americans who were
absolutely innocent ... |so) it's a
much jnore subtle event, be said.
"During Vietnam, [some] people
supported the government's po
sition out of loyalty to the armed
forces and to (he country, rather
than out ola sense that it was
morally the right thing to do,"
he added. "Now, 1 think you'll
have lots of people in the- U.S.
who believe that this is the right
thing to do in a moral sense,
seeking justice."
University administrators have
begun formulating a strategic plan
for dealing with student demon
strations that may arise in tbe near
future, I lennessy said, and will be
especially vigilant in ensuring that
the protests do not turn violent.
But he added that officials are
also eager to seize upon the possi
bilities for learning that the current
crisis presents.
" This has sent a message to all
educational institutions . . . that
we are woefully ignorant about not
only the Islamic faith and c ulture,
but of much of the Middle Hast,'
Hennessv said. "That part of the
world is too important to ignore."

Clark's Bio-X funding withdraw
al deemed 'disappointing'
Henness\ admitted that be was
"disappointed" In tbe decision of
Netscape co-lbundei |im ('.lark, a
former Stanford professoi and
close friend ol bis. to protest Presi
dent Bush's stem cell reseai th pol
icy by withdrawing $(">() million of a
$150 million donation to the I ni
versity made in 1999.
"While I think be made some
good points about the difficulties
with the polic\ as it's been pro
posed. 1 w.is disappointed that he
decided louse bis donation to Stan
ford as a \\ % av to voice and slum bis
displeasure, " Hennessy said.
"Jim fell the need to make a
very-strong statement about how
wrong he felt the [stem cell poli
cy] w.is, and in some sense our
gift was the mechanism that lie
used to make that very loud
noise," he added.
The remaining $90 million ol
('.lark's commitment will ensure
that the partial suspension ol the
grant — yvhie h ( lark gave to fund
the I niversitv's new Bio-N initia
tive, bringing togethei tbe fields ol
biosciences, medicine and engi
neering— does not prevent the
completion of the ( I a ik ( enter for
Biomedical T.ngii leering and Bio
scietu es. I lennessy said.
Nevertheless, I lennessy called
( lark's decision, yvliic h was direct
ed against Bush's decision to ex
lend federal funding only to re
search on existing stem (ell lines, a
signilic ant setback
" I he main difficulty is that the
money lie's suspending yvas in

ities and programs, whit h yverc

be said.
I lennessy also said that bis s\ m
pathv tenvard ('.lark's protests
against the Bush policy reflects .i
general sentiment among I niver
sitv experts that certain controver
sial forms of biomedic al research,
such as embryonic stem cell re
search and therapeutic cloning,
should not be prohibited.
"It is premature to close doyvn
avenues of research before you
fundamentally understand what
their value is," he said.
" There are absolutely moral
and ethical questions, very deep
and complex ones. But to shut off
that avenue of inquiry, not to be
able to ask what is the value of this
potential science in helping im
prove human lilc. I think that's just
premature."
Striving for the best of
both college worlds
According to I lennessy, the "re
naissance" in undergraduate edu
cation of which he often speaks is a
long-term two-part strategy which

was the ( reation of Stanford Intro

"Now our focus is ensuring that
we (.in maintain (he quality and
breadth ol the offerings and en
suring that the freshman and
sophomore seminars become ml
turalh part of the institution,"
I lenncss\ said.
I lie second element is "to ex
pand research opportunities for
undergraduates." I lenness\ s.iid,
by making the research process
more atcessible t<> students.
"M\ vision is that if we tan have
the sort of program we have on
Ireslunan seminars, Sophomore
('.ollege and sophomore dialogues,
and then provideeyery student the
opportunity to do an honors thesis

"We'll have, at the beginning,
the best ol what people normally
think of as the small liberal arts col
lege experient e, and we'll have the
besi ol what people tome to a great

Henness\ emphasized the im
port am e oft he freshman Introduc
tion to the I luinanitics tore to un
dergraduate education and down
played concerns that its prof usion of
clillei ing themes, texts and subjects
dilute the freshman experiente.
"We need to ensure that stu
dents really want tc» be involved in

the opportunity and [the| reflec

which students approach the
courses with excitement, as op
posed to reluctance."

and his wife confidence that

not affect his life at the school, I len

Terror produces new challenges
I lennessy said the sheer enormi

poses perhaps the most significant
challenge to Stanford as it attempts

to begin a new year smoothly.
" The [attack] has taken every

Opportunities for activism,
education
I lie forthcoming I .S. military
response to the events of Sept. 11 is
sure to spark a wave of at ti\ ism and
political engagement among Stan
ford's noloriousl\ dispassionate
student body not seen since the
Vietnam War protests on campus,
according to I lenness\.
"This probabh will generate a
lot more interest about tbe ques
tions of how to balance peat e and
security, how to balance freedom
and individual rights, how to put
an emphasis on justice rather than
on vengeance." be s.iid.
Hennessv added that, in mam
ways, tbe current situation is
"much more difficult" because,
while there was widespread agree
ment that the I S. engagement in
Vietnam was wrong, the moral im
plications of the comingconflii t are
more ambiguous.
" There's been a c rime commit

"During Vietnam, [some] people
supported the government's po

forces and to (he country, rather
than out ola sense that it was
morally the right thing to do,"
he added. "Now, 1 think you'll
have lots of people in the- U.S.
who believe that this is the right
thing to do in a moral sense,
seeking justice."
University administrators have
begun formulating a strategic plan
for dealing with student demon
strations that may arise in tbe near
future, I lennessy said, and will be
especially vigilant in ensuring that
the protests do not turn violent.
But he added that officials are
also eager to seize upon the possi
bilities for learning that the current
crisis presents.
" This has sent a message to all
educational institutions . . . that
we are woefully ignorant about not
only the Islamic faith and c ulture,
but of much of the Middle Hast,'
Hennessv said. "That part of the
world is too important to ignore."

"Jim fell the need to make a

I lie Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks on
the I S., and the seemingly immi
nent war into which they have
drawn the nation, will not merely
be the primary issue on the minds
of Stanford's leaders during the
academic year that begins today,
said I niversitv President John
I lennessy.
"I think 11ii> will !>e the defining
issue of your generation,'' I lennessy
said, during a wide-ranging inter
view with f'he Daily in his Building

grain to being a new freshman par
ent. I lennessy appeared relaxed
but focused on leading Stanford
through one of the most tumul
tuous periods in American history.
Terror produces new challenges
I lennessy said the sheer enormi
ty of the attack and its aftermath
poses perhaps the most significant
challenge to Stanford as it attempts

to begin a new year smoothly.
" The [attack] has taken every
body's attention away from every
thing else," he s.iid. "Managing
that and trying to get everybody
back to something that resembles
normal life is going to be key, but
the world does go on."
Still, while Hcnnessy said secu
rity measures will inevitably esca
late and "we'll all have to be 011 our
toes" .is a result of the attacks, he
stressed that daily life at the I ni
versity ought not to be significantly
altered.

agenda for how we want to work as

portant" to "strongly and immedi
ately" denounce acts of hate direct
ed toward Muslims and Arab-
Americans — .md in part it ular the
"hate e-mails' sent to Islamic stu
dent groups at Stanford — be
cause the p.issii »ns and emotions of
the general public were so in
flamed in the wake of the* attacks.
"I felt we should try toget ahead
of the curve and really try to pre
vent something that otherwise
could be a problem." he said, ex
plaining the stern statement of

Still, I lennessy conceded ib.it

criticism of bis handling of racist

said.
Opportunities for activism,
education
I lie forthcoming I .S. military
response to the events of Sept. 11 is
sure to spark a wave of at ti\ ism and
political engagement among Stan
ford's noloriousl\ dispassionate
student body not seen since the
Vietnam War protests on campus,
according to I lenness\.
"This probabh will generate a
lot more interest about tbe ques
tions of how to balance peat e and
security, how to balance freedom
and individual rights, how to put
an emphasis on justice rather than
on vengeance." be s.iid.
Hennessv added that, in mam
ways, tbe current situation is
"much more difficult" because,
while there was widespread agree
ment that the I S. engagement in
Vietnam was wrong, the moral im
plications of the comingconflii t are
more ambiguous.
" There's been a c rime commit
ted .igainst Americans who were
absolutely innocent ... |so) it's a
much jnore subtle event, be said.
"During Vietnam, [some] people
supported the government's po
sition out of loyalty to the armed
forces and to (he country, rather
than out ola sense that it was
morally the right thing to do,"
he added. "Now, 1 think you'll
have lots of people in the- U.S.
who believe that this is the right
thing to do in a moral sense,
seeking justice."
University administrators have
begun formulating a strategic plan
for dealing with student demon
strations that may arise in tbe near
future, I lennessy said, and will be
especially vigilant in ensuring that
the protests do not turn violent.
But he added that officials are
also eager to seize upon the possi
bilities for learning that the current
crisis presents.
" This has sent a message to all
educational institutions . . . that
we are woefully ignorant about not
only the Islamic faith and c ulture,
but of much of the Middle Hast,'
Hennessv said. "That part of the
world is too important to ignore."

Clark's Bio-X funding withdraw
al deemed 'disappointing'
Henness\ admitted that be was
"disappointed" In tbe decision of
Netscape co-lbundei |im ('.lark, a
former Stanford professoi and
close friend ol bis. to protest Presi
dent Bush's stem cell reseai th pol
icy by withdrawing $(">() million of a
$150 million donation to the I ni
versity made in 1999.
"While I think be made some
good points about the difficulties
with the polic\ as it's been pro
posed. 1 w.is disappointed that he
decided louse bis donation to Stan
ford as a \\ % av to voice and slum bis
displeasure, " Hennessy said.
"Jim fell the need to make a
very-strong statement about how
wrong he felt the [stem cell poli
cy] w.is, and in some sense our
gift was the mechanism that lie
used to make that very loud
noise," he added.
The remaining $90 million ol
('.lark's commitment will ensure
that the partial suspension ol the
grant — yvhie h ( lark gave to fund
the I niversitv's new Bio-N initia
tive, bringing togethei tbe fields ol
biosciences, medicine and engi
neering— does not prevent the
completion of the ( I a ik ( enter for
Biomedical T.ngii leering and Bio
scietu es. I lennessy said.
Nevertheless, I lennessy called
( lark's decision, yvliic h was direct
ed against Bush's decision to ex
lend federal funding only to re
search on existing stem (ell lines, a
signilic ant setback
" I he main difficulty is that the
money lie's suspending yvas in
tended to 112 und ongoing core fat il
ities and programs, whit h yverc
designed to < reate a more collab
orative environment (in Bio-N|."
be said.
I lennessy also said that bis s\ m
pathv tenvard ('.lark's protests
against the Bush policy reflects .i
general sentiment among I niver
sitv experts that certain controver
sial forms of biomedic al research,
such as embryonic stem cell re
search and therapeutic cloning,
should not be prohibited.
"It is premature to close doyvn
avenues of research before you
fundamentally understand what
their value is," he said.
" There are absolutely moral
and ethical questions, very deep
and complex ones. But to shut off
that avenue of inquiry, not to be
able to ask what is the value of this
potential science in helping im
prove human lilc. I think that's just
premature."
Striving for the best of
both college worlds
According to I lennessy, the "re
naissance" in undergraduate edu
cation of which he often speaks is a
long-term two-part strategy which

i> Mill in progress.
1 'lie first piece ol the strategy
was the ( reation of Stanford Intro
tluttors Studies, a <li\ ision that em
ploys freshman and sophomore
seminars and Sophomore College
to of lei undeu lassmen opportuni
ties foi small-group learning with
t<>p professors.
"Now our focus is ensuring that
we (.in maintain (he quality and
breadth ol the offerings and en
suring that the freshman and
sophomore seminars become ml
turalh part of the institution,"
I lenncss\ said.
I lie second element is "to ex
pand research opportunities for
undergraduates." I lenness\ s.iid,
by making the research process
more atcessible t<> students.
"M\ vision is that if we tan have
the sort of program we have on
Ireslunan seminars, Sophomore
('.ollege and sophomore dialogues,
and then provideeyery student the
opportunity to do an honors thesis
researt h 01 work in a restart h en
vironment, we will have accom
plished something reallx wonder
ful," I lennessy said.
"We'll have, at the beginning,
