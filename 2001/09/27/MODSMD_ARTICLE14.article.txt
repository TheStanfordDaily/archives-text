Id tlit* aftermath of this month's terrorist
attacks on New York City and Washing
ton, DC., (lit' international community
has <|iii< klv rallied to America's side.
Nearh every government on Karth, wit 11 the
notable exception of Iraq, lias issued public
statements of condolence to the I nited States.
And in many cases, international support has
come in a more tangible form than mere words
of sympathy. The overwhelmingly positive re
action been a source of surprise for some, \\ ho
feel the I nited States tendency to assume uni
lateralist policies has c reated a few too main
pockets of contempt within the- international
community.
NATO's 19 members passed a resolution
that, for the first time in the organi/ation's ."> I -
ve.u history, invokes \i tide live of its < hat tel.
which declares an attack on am one of its
members an attack on all. I i cnch. Ccrman and
British law enforcement officials have multi

gated and apprehended suspects who ma\ be
linked to the attacks. I Ins week, I nited Arab
Kiniratcs and Saudi Arabia renounced their
formal recognition »>l the laliban, leaving the
number of governments which recognize the
tei rorist-hai boring Afghani regime at one.
Many base said that foreign nations were so
quick to sympathize and support the United
States because tlicv, too, 1 ealized their vulnera
bility to terrorist threats. K\ working with us in
an international coalition to eliminate sue Ii
threats, those nations would be protecting
tlicit <>w n self-interest.
I his is to a large degree li ue. I ike the I lin
ed States, many othei nations emphasize glob
al interdependence'—the idea that nations
must wotk logeihei to accomplish goals and
cannot thrive w hen pi at ti< ing isolationism and
autarky loi examples of the destim that
awaits am nation whit Ii ignores this, one need
look no furihei 'ban the examples srt b\ states

such as North Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan.
While the I nited States purports to be the
world's leader in the post-Cold War era of
globalization, it does at times fail to cooperate
and practice what it pleaches. This attitude,
which can vary in practice from realist to
downright arrogant, could land this nation in
trouble should a future conflict requiring
widespread international cooperation to coii
quci arise.
I herefore. to protect its self-interest in this
increasingly borderless world, the United
States cannot act independenth of Other na
tions. When weighing the pros and cons of
human rights and environmental treaties, it
must consider international sentiment in the
proc ess. Rather than alienate allies and poten
tial allies l>\ singlchandcdh strapping the
\nti-Hallistic Missile lrcat\ to develop a na
tional missile defense, it must work to strike
multinational compromise. When formulating

trade policies, (Congress must not <len\ (Central
Kurope's steelmakers and African and
(Caribbean farmers access to our markets.
Just as these lessons apply to our govern
mental decision makers, tliey can apply on a
more basic level. (Conceptions ola nation come
not only from the actions of iis government,
bin from the actions of its people, too. We indi
vidual American citizens can improve our in
ternational position by eradicating negative
stereotypes of Americans.
Whether traveling abroad, studvingat Stan
ford or working in the outside community, we
can heighten our appreciation of and respect
for foreign cultures by seeking to understand
the mores, worldviews and attitudes of those
who come from lands bcvond our borders. A
heightened sense of international awareness
will not only enrich us culturally, but it may in
directiv improve our long-term prospects of
