TEHRAN, Iran (AP) —
Iran's supreme leader said in a
blistering speech Wednesday
thai his nation would not par
ticipate in any U.S.-led coali
tion against terrorism, taking a
tough line despite many Irani
ans' expressions ol sympathy
for Americans.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
called the I '.S.'s behavior "dis
gusting" and said in a state
tun television address to the
nation that Iran does not con
sider the United States "com
petent and sincere [enough] to
lead any global campaign
against terrorism."
American officials had pub
licly raised the possibility of
working with Iran as the U.S.
retaliates lot the attacks on the
World Trade (-enter and the
Pentagon. The prime target of
an attack would be Saudi exile
Osama bin Laden, who is be
lieved to be harbored by
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers.
In the wake of the Sept. 1 1
attacks, reformist President
Mohammad Khatami had ex
pressed "deep regret and sym
pathy with the victims." Many
Iranians signed a condolence
book at the U.S. interest section
at the Swiss Embassy in Tehran
and some 4,000 of them held a
candlelit vigil for the American
victims — though hard-line
vigilantes broke it up.
But Khamenei — a hard
liner who outranks the- presi
dent— took a much tougher
line against the U.S. in yester
day's speech, rejecting Bush's
declaration that nations had to

choose between being "with us
or terrorism."
"We are not with you." he
said. "At the same time, we are
not with terrorists. America is
not sincere in fighting terror
ism. It has other objectives.
America's hands are stained
with all the crimes committed
by the Zionist regime."
America's behavior, by ex
pecting help but not earning
the respect of other nations,
was "disgusting," Khamenei
said.
The U.S. has not had diplo
matic relations with Iran for 22
years, leaving a gap that cannot
easily be bridged even with c ri
sis as an impetus.
"Iran will not participate in
any move under U.S. leader
ship. Iran will not extend any
assistance to the U.S. and its al
lies in attac king the already suf
fering Muslim neighboring
Afghanistan," Khamenei said
in his address to families of sol
dieis killed in ilie 198( 1 88
Iran-Iraq war.
I lie U.S. says Iran sponsors
terrorism by providing
weapons to lle/bollah fighters
in Lebanon for their attacks on
Israel. Iran steadfastly opposes
Israel's occupation of Palestin
ian territories and accuses
Washington of being biased to
ward the Jewish state.
American leaders are seek
ing Mideast support — from
the use of military installations
and airspace to intelligence —
as it builds forces for an ex
pected assault on bin Laden's
operations in Afghanistan.
