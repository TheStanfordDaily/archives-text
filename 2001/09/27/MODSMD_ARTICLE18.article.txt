# OPEC reaches agreement on oil supply
## Oil cartel likely to maintain output at current level 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) —
OPKC delegates reached agree
ment late yesterday on how much
crude oil they would supply to a
precarious world economy, hut de
clined to formally announce the
decision until until after more talks
on today.
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries gave no ex
planation for the delay, and dele
gates refused to give details about
their dec ision as they left the cartel's
headquarters in Vienna, Austria.
I lowever, several delegates said
earlier that OPEC is likely to stick
with its current oflicial output lev
els of million barrels a day. A
nuniT>er of energy analysts shared
that view.
OPEC oilicials broke oil infor
mal talks earlier in the day without
agreeing on whether to adjust
crude output. They then met in
the evening to coordinate a com
mon production strategy with odi
i ials from eight non-OPEC oil pro
ducing countries including Mexi
co, Russia and Angola at OPEC
headquarters.
I lie delay of OPEC's an
nouncement was not a complete
surprise, but it highlights the dil
ficulty ()PE(. members face in try
ing to reach a consensus amid the
intense economic and political
uncertainty prevailing since the
Sept. 11 terror attacks on the
United States.
Although oil prices have
plunged several dollars since the
attacks, OPEC's 11 members are
constrained from cutting output to
bolster prices because such a step
could tip the fragile world econo

my decisively into recession.
OPEC's room to maneuver is
limited further by the reluctance of
key members to antagonize the
U.S., the top importer of OPEC
crude, as it leads an alliance against
Afghanistan's lalihan regime and
lorces loyal to Osama bin l.aden,
the prime suspect in the terror at
tacks.
"OPEC's basic problem is they
can't doatiNthing," said Kaad Alka
diri.an analyst with I he Petroleum

consultancy.
An OPEC spokesman told re
porters that a decision had been
drafted but that OPEC wouldn't
announce it until today. I le spoke
on customary condition of
anonymity.
