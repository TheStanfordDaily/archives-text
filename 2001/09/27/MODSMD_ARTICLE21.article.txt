Altei rain forced the stoppage <>l pla\ in the mid

third round yesterday.
I nit u t unatch. this proved not to be the case as the
weather limited the teams to onl\ complete the srt
ontl round.
I'layed at the Washington National Coif course in
~. Wash, the eighlh-ranked ( ardiual finished
the two-day tournament, tied loi 10th with a score til
013. Texas and Auburn. bt>th (op-lhree teams, tietl
for the team title, with both shooting a 3 over-pat .">'.>l.
Rounding out the top five were luls.i with .>O2,
()hio Stale with 501 and Michigan State with 001.
I .catling the wa\ for Stanford was the indi\idualef
fort of senior Salimah Mussani. Ihe transfer from
I exas shot a team-high I .">O, whit h was good enough
to tie lot 23rd tin the individual t harts.
Alst) playing well lor the Cardinal were sopho
mores Kim Kouwabunpat and Angela Klio.
Kouwabunpat tied for 39th with a 1 52 while Rho tietl
for the 02nd spot b\ carding a 155.
junior Kim Rowton and senior Jessica Belskis also
played at the tournament and finished tied for 71st
with a 150 and 107 th with a 105, respectively.
l.orcna ()t boa of Ari/ona t laimed the top individ
ual spot by shooting a blistering five-under-par 139.
IVpperdine's Katherine Hull was comfortably be
hind. but still shot a remarkable two-under-par 142.
I he Cardinal finished the first round, tied for
18th. Mussani's pla\ dropped in the second round as
she finished 2 3rd, after pla\ ing well enough it) be tied
for 12th after the first round.
This tournament provetl to be a disappointing
start for the ('.ardiual as much has been expected after
finishing in the top-10 .it the NCAA Championships
for the eighth straight year. I he team finished ninfh
at the (championships last season.
C ran ted that the
team <otild have
improved its posi

round been

played, but the Cardinal's performance in the first
two rounds fell dismally short ol the team's potential.
liy finishing tied for Kith, ii was the first time in 33
tournaments tli.it the Stanford team did not finish in
the top 10.
I lie (.ardinal must till the large shoes of two kev
graduated seniors, Stephanie Kecvei and Milan
I lolmeyer. Keever is now on the 1 l'(IA tour.
Its relatively poor finish at the \( .AA 112 all I'rex iew
certainly did not result from lat k of talent or experi
ence, because the team still has three of its live starters
returning.
After redshirtmg last year. Mussani will join Row
ton, Rho and Kouwabunpat for her first lull season
with the ('.ardinal.
Rho received second-team all I'ac-10 honors while
Kouwabunpat garnered an honorable mention all
I'ac-10 award last year.
1 he team will take this week oil belore traveling to
(lorvallis, ()regon, to pla\ in the Slianu o Invitational
on(>d. 8-10.
With the team looking good on paper, Stanford
looks to dismiss its recent humble performance and
improve its locus towards the NCAA ('.hampionships.
