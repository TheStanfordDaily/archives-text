I'ell me about your experience
reeording this record. Did you
feel less pressure lor commercial
success?
Tim: cs, I ihink there were no
real expectations lot this album.
I he la si one didn't do (|iiite so
well. I here were no pressures,
and ihe iiuisu tame really easily .

How do you think you have grown 011 (his album?
Tim: I'eople sav we've gone ba< k i<» the si\ le ol the first
alhn 111. Ii kind ol is and isn't. We just were finding our

sound with this
record. I think it's
out best collet I ion ol
songs.

Of which aspect of
"Free All Angels" are
you the proudest?
Charlotte: Its 0111
best sounding 1 ecot<l
I he prod in lion is a
lot better.
Tim: I love Ihe sound
ol it. It's a feel good
ret o rd. II you're
going to put it 011, il
will give \ou ,1 good
bit//. I nusual these
days — il you get a
pop album, usually
there are not too
many good songs. A
lew good singles, and
1 hen you've got other
albums thai take a
long time to gel into,
but they're great al
bums as a whole. Am
I making any sense?

Are you a fan of Iggy Pop?
Tim: I love Iggy.
Charlotte: It's so honkers seeing him running around
hat kstage.
Tim: I haven't had the guts to go up to him.
Charlotte: \owav. 11 is heard is really sear\.
Tim: I'd love to meet him though.
Mow do you feel about the music that is coming out
lately and where you fit into it?
I'im: I here's .1 lot ol good records coming out this
ye.u I guess Wee/ei .ire the (losest hand to lis. I'he\
desci ibc tlieii music as really lie.iw pop songs.
Charlotte: During the time we wei e recording it. there
w,is .1 lot ol the new acoustii movement — lr.i\is.
Cold play — wliei eas we were nun h louder and much
mot c enci getic than t hey are.
Tim: Yeah, we didn't know how we were going to lit
into that. Music this year is very eclectic, it's very cool.
Do you feel you are perceived differently in the US
than in Europe?
Tim: Yeah, we haven't been to the I Sin the last linn
years hardly. Well, our album's been up on Napstei
fora < ouplc months. It helped get a good bu// for this
album before it i atne out. Apparently the people who
use Napster are the biggest CI) buyers.
In those last years, the band has been through a few
major changes. What prompted the decision to add
another guitarist?
Tim: We alwav s felt i estru led live as a three-piece. \\ e
had always wanted to have an extra guitar, but we
couldn't llnd the right person. We had a bit of a break
between albums, so we thought we should look. 1 met

('.harlotlt* through .1 friend. It's much hel
ler than doing the whole auditioning
thing.
Now has the chemistry changed?
Tim: I here are more layer* to sounds,
more guitars, so much more we < an do. It's
nice ha\ ing a gii I around.
What has your experience been like as a
female guitarist? Do you feel like you are
perceived differently and that you have
to overcompensate to be taken seriously,
or are you simply one of the guys?
Charlotte: 111 a sense, I am one ol the guvs,
hut then the fact that I .1111 a female is very
important at the same time. It's weird,
whenever I say I am in a band, people al
ways say, 'you're a singer." and I say, 'no,
I'm a guitarist,' and the general response
is 'whoa.' It is good, but I wish I could
meet other female guitarists as well I here
are lots of bands like Sleater-Kinnev and
Kiltie, there are lots ol girl kind ol bands,
but it's different.
Tim: We did a gig in Dublin. I here were
about 20 other bands there, and the only
othei girl 1 here was Sinead ()'('.onnor.
Charlotte: I alwavs get git Is t oming up to
me after gigs saving, 'vou realh want to

make me play guitat now. I'm going to
give up m\ ballet lessons.'
Has being a role model been a big part of
your role as a musician?
Charlotte: \»> one evei made .1 Inss about
it before, and when I joined Ash, it was
such .1 big deal that I was a girl. I shied
a wax 110111 vx ant ing to talk about it. Now, I
guess, I am comlortahlc with it.
Tim: We're just .1 hand ol Ircaks reallv.
How?
Tim: Well have vou seen Rick's breasts?
He's got breasts?
Tim: lie's very proud of tbent.
When did you decide to start a band?
Tim: We wanted to get out <>l Northern
Ireland. It seemed like an exciting life. It
was a dream we had since we were I'J
Looking back, now that you are older,
would you have done anything differently?
Tim: Well, tnavbe would have gotten less
complacent after initial success. At the
same time, I think we needed to learn a
lesson. Making this album, evervone
worked really hard. I don't think we will
stop.

What do you think you have gained from
the experience of being successful at a
young age?
Charlotte: I guess I've got more confi
dent c than I 11 it I when I u .is I <S. [ I'm | a hit
more outgoing and confident on the stage.
I raveling gives vou so in lit li pcrspet live.
Tim: You learn to see through bullshit.
What do you hope to achieve now that you
are still pretty young?
Tim: We are still prctl\ nun li unknown in
Anient a. II we were hettei known in the
States I would be happier. •
Would you want to change anything
sound-wise in the future?
Tim: I lie most important thing for us is
the songs. I think our new album is quite
divei sc. I i Innk we'll evolve with new ideas
as we gt> along.
Do you think your main focus will still be
the accessible yet in-depth pop song?
Tim: Yeah, il you've got good songs people
will alwavs pick up on that. Hut I don't know.
Why do you make music?
Tim: For me. it's a compulsion.
Charlotte: I here is nothing else I love
doing as much as music.
