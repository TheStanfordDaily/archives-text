I'ell me about your experience
reeording this record. Did you
feel less pressure lor commercial
success?
Tim: cs, I ihink there were no
real expectations lot this album.
I he la si one didn't do (|iiite so
well. I here were no pressures,
and ihe iiuisu tame really easily .

How do you think you have grown 011 (his album?
Tim: I'eople sav we've gone ba< k i<» the si\ le ol the first
alhn 111. Ii kind ol is and isn't. We just were finding our

sound with this
record. I think it's
out best collet I ion ol
songs.

Of which aspect of
"Free All Angels" are
you the proudest?
Charlotte: Its 0111
best sounding 1 ecot<l
I he prod in lion is a
lot better.
Tim: I love Ihe sound
ol it. It's a feel good
ret o rd. II you're
going to put it 011, il
will give \ou ,1 good
bit//. I nusual these
days — il you get a
pop album, usually
there are not too
many good songs. A
lew good singles, and
1 hen you've got other
albums thai take a
long time to gel into,
but they're great al
bums as a whole. Am
I making any sense?

Are you a fan of Iggy Pop?
Tim: I love Iggy.
Charlotte: It's so honkers seeing him running around
hat kstage.
Tim: I haven't had the guts to go up to him.
Charlotte: \owav. 11 is heard is really sear\.
Tim: I'd love to meet him though.
Mow do you feel about the music that is coming out
lately and where you fit into it?
I'im: I here's .1 lot ol good records coming out this
ye.u I guess Wee/ei .ire the (losest hand to lis. I'he\
desci ibc tlieii music as really lie.iw pop songs.
Charlotte: During the time we wei e recording it. there
w,is .1 lot ol the new acoustii movement — lr.i\is.
Cold play — wliei eas we were nun h louder and much
mot c enci getic than t hey are.
Tim: Yeah, we didn't know how we were going to lit
into that. Music this year is very eclectic, it's very cool.
Do you feel you are perceived differently in the US
than in Europe?
Tim: Yeah, we haven't been to the I Sin the last linn
years hardly. Well, our album's been up on Napstei
fora < ouplc months. It helped get a good bu// for this
album before it i atne out. Apparently the people who
use Napster are the biggest CI) buyers.
In those last years, the band has been through a few
major changes. What prompted the decision to add
another guitarist?
Tim: We alwav s felt i estru led live as a three-piece. \\ e
had always wanted to have an extra guitar, but we
couldn't llnd the right person. We had a bit of a break
between albums, so we thought we should look. 1 met
