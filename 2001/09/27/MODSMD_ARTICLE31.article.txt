Second, the conventions ol

the hipster responsible loi those

potbellied, sluggish, middle

Hut the New Deal, a good
looking young trio from Cana
da, are a remedy for both
malaises. Like the old Pollv-O
string cheese commercials tli.it

purported to give vou a pi//a
without the same, the New Deal
promises to deliver live D)
dance music, without the 1)|.
With I).m Kurt/on bass, Dar

keyboards, the
New I)eal uses a
live show built

beats and ex

sations to unite
two heretofore

segregated sets ol I.ins: the ec sta

\\ h\ someone hadn't

I don't know

the lirst studio effort from the

tight I / I house beat—and real

Validating comparisons of
the hand to Kraltwerk, the 2nd
track, "Receiver", shimmies
along with beats that bordci on

I hroughout, I was im
pressed with the transi
tions, the inodulations, the
sheet music ianship - even
as the\ aped some lairh
conventional dance inusi<
mollis.
Hut the whole point ol
l)| dance music is thai n is
produced. Sounds and
rh\ thins are buti liereil and
repacked so that an in Un
it y ol narratives and tex
tures are present.

I to the New l)r;tl on
im stereo, I could envision eat h
member <>l the trio artfully con
(i ihuting their solitarv line. And
sometimes the token vocal sam
ples seem a bit lon ed, an almost
disingenuous plo\ to furthei
the iniini( in ol produced dance

music.
Where the produced slull
holds an infinity <>l polyrhvth
mit and polyphonit delights,
the New Deal is a hit more lin
ear. (iood, but limited iu
breadth and scope.
So while, m comeit, the Neu

Deal satisfy our subcon

lheir studio efforts sound as it
they < ould stand a little rework

middleman being, in other
words, one ol (hose nice, net (Iv.
