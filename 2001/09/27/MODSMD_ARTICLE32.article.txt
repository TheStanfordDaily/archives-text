## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH STAFF WRITER 
It was not a good summer .11 the movies "Shrek and
"Moulin Rouge" were the onl\ iwo films with I »<»lIt st\le
and substance. I lie\ made me smile a lot and leel good
about going to the mo\ ies.
I lie i est of the cut ties this sin ninei were unreasonably
medio( re, with onl\ .1 lew ot ( asional glimpses at good act
ing, good writing 01 good directing. KOl even with line
m "Shrek," they was an equally reprehensible gross-out
gag in "Scan Movie 2." lot even livch song and dance
sequence 111 "Moulin Rouge," there was an equall) lack
adaisical at lion sequente in "Jurassit fat k 111
l<> wrap things up, here are my pit ks for the good,
the bad and the ugh at the movies during the suniinet
or 2001.
The good: Nicole Kidman. She gave the best pet loi -
mailt eol the yeat in the |a//\ "Moulin Rouge (which is
also shaping up to be the best film of the yeat so far).
\nd, il tli.it wasn't enough, she was the onl\ ant hoi that
held "I he ()thers" in plat c keeping the slow and drea
n stor\ line Iroin floating oil into the land ol "been
t here, done I hat "ghost stories.
The bad: |ohn I ravolta. Alter stall ing in the wot si
movie ol 2000 ("battlefield lartli"), I ravolta tried to
st.in alive l>\ starring 111 this siuiiinei ol 2001 s worst
movie ("Swortllish"). Mis next move? Id recommend
lii ing Ins agent.
The ugly: |ohn I ravolta s hail 111 "Swortllish. Some
w here out there. I here's .i ferret who is si ill |< >< >k 111 ij loi

Ins toupee.
The good: "Atneriian fie 2." It wasn't
inticdiblv original 01 even as lunn) as the
first "Ameritan I'ie. but il was the sum
mer's (inl\ sequel with its heart in the light
plat e.
The bad: "I he Mumm) Returns."
"Scary Movie 2," "Jurassit fark IV and
"Rush flon 1 2." With meager stor\ lines
and hurried protlut titms. the rest of the se
quels ol the summer played like, well, .1
bad John I ravolta movie. And what's
worse, negotiations have rcportcdl)
begun lot a third "Rush Hour" and a
font ill "Jurassit Fan cy-fai."

The ugly: I lie "A.1." eliding. I hose last few scenes
were too sugar-coated even for .1 Disney movie.
The good: "Shrek." I he hest blot khustet »»l the suin
mer, with the hi ightest and most witt\ writing foi a fani
il\ film sine v " I o\ Sim \ 2."
The had: " I he Deep Knd. Some »i itii s are i ailing it
one ol the hest films of the war. But I think it's about as
shallow .is the\ get.
The ugly: |ulia Roberts in a lat suit in "America's
Sweethearts." \<>i that |ulla Roberts looks ugl\ in am
kind ol suit hut the scenes were .1 meagei attempt to
once again - suggest that plump people end up alone
and miserable until tliev < an shed a feu pounds and look

Tin- good: I lie last :<() minutes ol "Jay and Silent Bob
Strike Back." When it comes to poking fun at Holly
wood, look no further lor wonderful one-liners and .t
fair share of < ameos.
The had: I he I list f>o minutes ol "Jay and Silent Bob
Sti ike I).h k " \\ hen it comes to contrived wt iting, look
no lui thet lot the road trip scenario th.it doesn't lead
an\ where.
The ugly: 'he beginning ol the I.ill season. I ast year
gave us such sc rcen gems as "Nui se Belt) and "Almost
I anions." I his vear. the best thing at the theaters is the
keanu Reeves baseball flu k "Hardball." That's not ex
ac tl\ u hat vou'cl ( all a home i tin.
