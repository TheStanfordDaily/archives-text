From a musical perspeetive,
on the other hand, I have noth

ambitious, not littered with
memorable arias, but neat, cotn
plete and quite melodious. Yes,
there are hints of early Yet than
influences (the composer did

are never carried too far. A duet
between knel and Valinace
(Letehezar Pravtchev and C.or

Indeed, the SFO benefited
from the Armenian language

number of debut
performances. Afi
cionados looking
for compact discs
will only meet with

adulterated early
