been largely absent from the small
screen in recent years, but have finally
re-emerged on the big screen with this
summer's release, "Wet Hot American
Summer."
Directed In State founding member
David Wain and starring hall of the
show's original cast members. "Wet Hot"
features the same brand ol random,
shocking humor that made " The State"
such a successful and pioneering project
in the mid- 1990s.
"Wet Hot" aims to parody the long
lorgotten genre ol earl\ 80s summer
tamp classics, sin li as "I'orkv's and
"Meatballs", which were considered
shockingb sexually exploitative 20 years
ago but seem tame bv todav's standards.

1 he film follows the ellorts ola group
ol counselors to have one linal lling on

lot using on the geek\ and .sensitive ('.t»t)p
(Slate lountlihg inembei Michael
Showaltcr), who is infatuated with beauti
ful co-counselor Katie (Marguerite
Moi tau).
I nlortunatelv, Katie is not interested
in (loop's romantit and poet it overtures,
instead preferring the company of the
slightly less-sensitive but more <uir.itlive
lifeguard ,\nd\ (Paul Rutld). Rutltl is hi
larious .is Andy, continually neglecting
his lifeguard responsibilities in favor of
making out with other counselors oil the

As an example ol one such seme, a

presumably foi food and ails supplies.
I lie camera cuts to a random scattering
ol scenes of cast members shooting hero

bat k-alle\ crackhouse, only to have the
counselors return smiling and innocent
some hall-hour later.
Ktjuall\ random humorous moments
are scattered throughout the film, and
moviegoers are continuall) lelt to won
der what will happen next, or even just
what the hell is happening now. It is
just this kind of t haotic humor th.it made
" I lie State" sue li a suet ess and makes
"Wet I lot one as well.
While not quite as innovative or intei
esting as its television counterpart. " I he

still belter and limnici than ( .W pertent ol
the releases in this summer's inter
minablv bad summer film season.
