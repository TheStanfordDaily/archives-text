As in the origin.ll stoiv, the
viewer follows IVArtagnan in

also to avenge his parents, who
were killed in front ol him as a

named Feb re. Other aspects of
the plot stray from the original

as well, as

acting, despite the presence ol

the tension between D'Artag

Most disappointing however
is (lie tail that hidden within
