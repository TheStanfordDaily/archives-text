I I it* Sept. I I terrorist attacks on the
U.S. forced the Stanford in Washington
program to delay its start by tour (lavs,
while the Overseas Studies Programs of
fice reported that the calendars of its seven
fall programs were unaffected bv the
tragedies.
1 lie Stanford in Washington program
was origitialh m heduled to begin with the
students' arrival on Sept. 13, hut federal
officials had not given the green-light tot
commercial air travel to resume by that
date. In response, the program estab
lished a new arrival date of Sept. 17.
I wo overseas programs had alread\
begun prior to the terrrorist attacks, and
the remaining five have had no s< hedule
changes, according to Jacqueline VVen
der, executive director of the Overseas
Studies Program.
"In the immediate days after the at
tacks, a number of students reconsidered
their plans to study abroad." VVender said,
adding that, in the end, only a handful ac -
tually changed their plans.
VVender said that, to her knowledge,
only four of 203 students decided to stay
on the main campus this quarter in the
wake of the tragedy.
No students dec ided to pull out of the
Stanford in Washington program, ac

"Students tclt strongly that they wanted
to be here. 1 lie\ are part of an interesting

|amicson s.iid that five students have
internships this quarter at the State De

committee on I errorism.
Ac t ording to Jamieson, the difference
between the state of the program before
and after the attacks is that "now all of us,
not just in Washington but everywhere,
are being more conscious in terms of
safety."
Mike Mongan, Stanford in Washing
ton's resident assistant, said that on the
whole, the attacks did not significantly
change the course of the program.
"['l he students] look at it as an impor

said. " I hev're excited about the opportu
