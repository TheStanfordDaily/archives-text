### DURANT GIPSON STAFF WRITER 
I I it* Sept. I I terrorist attacks on the
U.S. forced the Stanford in Washington
program to delay its start by tour (lavs,
while the Overseas Studies Programs of
fice reported that the calendars of its seven
fall programs were unaffected bv the
tragedies.
1 lie Stanford in Washington program
was origitialh m heduled to begin with the
students' arrival on Sept. 13, hut federal
officials had not given the green-light tot
commercial air travel to resume by that
date. In response, the program estab
lished a new arrival date of Sept. 17.
I wo overseas programs had alread\
begun prior to the terrrorist attacks, and
the remaining five have had no s< hedule
changes, according to Jacqueline VVen
der, executive director of the Overseas
Studies Program.
"In the immediate days after the at
tacks, a number of students reconsidered
their plans to study abroad." VVender said,
adding that, in the end, only a handful ac -
tually changed their plans.
VVender said that, to her knowledge,
only four of 203 students decided to stay
on the main campus this quarter in the
wake of the tragedy.
No students dec ided to pull out of the
Stanford in Washington program, ac
cording to program director Adrienne
|amieson. All part it ipating students made
it to Washington on the new arrival date

or the da\ after, she said.
|amicson said that the program's acad
emic schedule was unchanged, but that
orientation had to he adjusted because of
the compressed time frame.
"Initially. Stanford students and their
parents were jumpy and nervous about
the same things .is Stanford students in
Palo Alto," jamicson said.
Kut the students' interest in public pol
i< \ triumphed over their feat s, she said.
"Students tclt strongly that they wanted
to be here. 1 lie\ are part of an interesting
polic \ disc ussion in town and elsewhere."
|amicson s.iid that five students have
internships this quarter at the State De
partment, one .it the- National Institute of
11 call h in biotei rorisin and one at the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee's Sub
committee on I errorism.
Ac t ording to Jamieson, the difference
between the state of the program before
and after the attacks is that "now all of us,
not just in Washington but everywhere,
are being more conscious in terms of
safety."
Mike Mongan, Stanford in Washing
ton's resident assistant, said that on the
whole, the attacks did not significantly
change the course of the program.
"['l he students] look at it as an impor
tant time for them to be here," Mongan
said. " I hev're excited about the opportu
nity to be contributing."
VVender stressed that the attacks have
had a worldwide impact.
"The events of Sept. I 1 aliened
people all over the world," she
said. "('.lobal communities are try
ing to come to terms with what
happened."
I he Overseas Studies ollice is
reviewing security measures at all
ol its campuses around the world,
according to Wender.
I lie attacks highlight the im
portance of studying abroad,
Wender added.
"Now more than ever before it
is really critical for people,
whether through programs like
ours or not, to learn more about
other people, other cultures land]
other languages," she said.
Studying abroad is "the only
real road toward global under
standing," Wender continued.
Junior Leanna Albrecht, who
leaves lor Stanford's Paris program
today, said her mother was con
cerned about her going abroad.
"I really want to go, and I
don't think it'll be that differ
ent, Albrecht said. "II anything,
it'll be safer now because every
one is concerned and security is
heightened."
