I he concerns raised In Nike's critics are
justified. Nike lias been accused ol allowing

substandard conditions in its factories, and
the factories of its subcontractors, in countries
such as Indonesia and Vietnam. Stanford
should not do business with companies that
consistently and obviusly violate basic human
rights laws and make no eflbrt to improve
their i onduct.
Nike lias responded to the critic isms lev

(ommendablv, the company is improving
its record on following labor laws. In May,
I .S. Surgeon (iencral David Satchel
praised Nike lor the efforts it was making
to ensure compliance with overseas labor
laws. Nike is trying to change its conduct
in these areas by taking reasonable mea
sures such as hiring outside consulting
funis — at its own expense — to monitor
factories. Presumably, this type of im
provement in Nike's behavior is what
Stanfoi (1 w ants to see.
Km thcrmore, using the logic of Nike's c l it

ics, the alternatives to the contract are poten
tially just as problematic. II Stanford athletes
bought their own Nike uniforms, the logo
would still be on the uniform, as it would with
any other brand of clothing. ()ther companies
have not received the scrutiny that Nike has,
but that does not guarantee that their human
rights records are any better. Ihe benefits of
switching away from Nike are elusive.
1 he picture of Stanford athletes being
sucked up b\ (he Nike corporate monster is an
exaggeration. The Nike contract is a net ben
efit for Stanford athletes and, indirectly, the
entire University.
I lie contract does not subsume Stanford to
Nike; indeed, it allows choice for the Athletics
Department and individual athletes. The Uni
versity acted intelligently in fostering thought
ful debate on the issue and giving Nike's op
ponents a chance to express their views. It
acted even more wisely in choosing to renew
the contract.
