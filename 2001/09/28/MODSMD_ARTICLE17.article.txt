Turn to Afghanistan to express

America is now fin used on responding
to (he terrorist attacks of a few weeks ago.
Our leaders have made it very dear that
the I nited States is going to take this event
as the beginning of a real war. The anger
ol our (iti/ens has hecn focuscd on a single
man who is living in .1 faraway region of
the planet called Afghanistan.
Many people are af raid or angrv or just

United States funded Taliban's

ing opium poppy (arms to be "against the

ol religious fundamentalists with docu
mented abuses ol human rights, the
I . S. government ignored the I aliban's
systematized cruelties in order to push
its own domestic and dogmatic anti
drug agenda.
In the wake ol the Sept. 11 calamities, it

is grotescjueh ironic that "we" gave mil
lions in anti-drug aid to Afghanistan's 1 al
iban, the regime that, in addition to com
mitting countless d imes against Afghani
people, still harhorshin I.aden and his net
work of suspected terrorists. The U. S.
government militarized the I aliban to
punish Afghani fanners growing opium
poppies. I hese farmers were desperate

Turn to Afghanistan to express
your emotions
America is now fin used on responding
to (he terrorist attacks of a few weeks ago.
Our leaders have made it very dear that
the I nited States is going to take this event
as the beginning of a real war. The anger
ol our (iti/ens has hecn focuscd on a single
man who is living in .1 faraway region of
the planet called Afghanistan.
Many people are af raid or angrv or just
sad. It will he difficult lot many people to
mentally deal with these emotions. One
question has been placed into our minds:
where is ()sama bin I aden?
I deal with world events from the glob

and prayers .ire Un used in thai direction.
\\ hen I It-el anger towards America from
these terrorist organizations. I again ac

— the one financing these operations — is

\l\ thought is this: what if everyone in

Afghanistan is located? What il everyone
was paying attention when our military

So direct your emotions for this war .it
the correct part ol the planet. It makes

United States funded Taliban's
anti-drug actions
What do the I nited States government
and the Taliban have in common? Unbri
dled fanaticism. When the U.S. govern
ment gave million dollars to the I al-
iban, in exchange for the I aliban declar
ing opium poppy (arms to be "against the
will of (iod, (lit' I nited States sought to
fuel its own lanatical obsession, the wai on
drugs.
Despite American knowledge that the
I aliban w.ts an oppressive rogue regime
ol religious fundamentalists with docu
mented abuses ol human rights, the
I . S. government ignored the I aliban's
systematized cruelties in order to push
its own domestic and dogmatic anti
drug agenda.
In the wake ol the Sept. 11 calamities, it

is grotescjueh ironic that "we" gave mil
lions in anti-drug aid to Afghanistan's 1 al
iban, the regime that, in addition to com
mitting countless d imes against Afghani
people, still harhorshin I.aden and his net
work of suspected terrorists. The U. S.
government militarized the I aliban to
punish Afghani fanners growing opium
poppies. I hese farmers were desperate
lot a cash crop to leed their lamilies in a
countr\ of decimated agricultural infras
tructure. In funding the I aliban, the I . S.
government may have indirectl\ subsi
dized terrorism. Just one more example of
