I S( s speed .is Sianfbrd's biggest
concern when ii faces the Trojans
loinoiiow at the l.os Angeles

"(I S(. has| a leant that is more
explosive, faster than probably 00
percent til the track teams in the

prepare for that?" Willinghain
s.ikl. "Thev've got an awesome
arra\ of speed, and it's not just ai
the receivei positions or the run
ning bat k positions, ii is across the

I S( 's speed transfers over lo
the defensive side of the ball as
well, ('.arroll doubles as the 1 ro

I S( \ defense is sure to be
Stanford's most talented foe vet in

week after holding a talented
Kansas State squad to just 10
points, the 1 rojans lost a 21-22
heart breaker to ()regon. I S( 1 was
