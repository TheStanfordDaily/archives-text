# Language departments frozen
## Six departments nimble to hire new faculty until committee makes report 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Faculty searches and hires
within six departments have been
frozen until a blue-ribbon com
mittee convened by Provost John
Etchemendy to discuss restruc
turing proposals for the hvpo
thetical Division of Literatures,
Cultures and Languages, reports
its findings.
I he committee may report as
early as the end of fill quarter.
Some members of the proposed
division say that their departments
have been paralyzed by tins
freeze — a freeze that comes 011 the
heels of years of under-staffing, at -
cording to Italian Prof. |effre\
Schnapp.
"Though we have enrollments
bursting through the roof, we are
down five faculty members 111
French alone in the past 10 years,"
Schnapp said.
Some department memlxn'ssaid
they are perplexed with the reason
ing behind the faculty freeze.
"It's just mind boggling," Assoc..
Prof, of Italian Carolyn Springer
said. "They would never freeze fac
ulty appointments in English."
Enrollments have grown so
much in the department that the
student enrollment-to-facultv ratio
of the Department of French and
Italian is the highest of any depart

limit m the School ot Humanities
and Sciences, even without the de
partmt'nt's language course and

"We were the nunibci seven de
partment in the count n the last
time we were ranked. I could easilx
see us dropping l()rankssimpl\ be
cause we've been decimated in
terms ol faculh and not allowed to
rebuild," he said.
"Something needs to be done
within the next \c.ii or else we are
going to have serious problems
with retention of senioi fac uli\he
added.
Some members of departmental
fac ult\ have a slightl\ different view
of the issue.
"My main concern is that the
freeze in the searches, which is
ver\ demorali/ing foi all facult\
and students, sends ,i ver\ bad
message toot hei univei sities," s.nd
Prof. |olianlies (>umbrecht, acting
c hair of the Department of I rem h
.md Italian.
"French should be high on the
list ot departmentsthat get new fac
ulty," (iumbrecht s.iid, "Over the
next two or three veai s. we should
lx- able to hire two 01 three excel
lent faculty members."
(iumbrecht stressed that this
opinion was not based on enroll
ment, but rather on the idea that
French as a discipline is impor
tant. He noted rliat when current
National Securitv Advisor (lon

dolee/.za Rice was provost, she was
asked whether Stanford would
maintain .1 classics department
with zero enrollment.
"She said that we would, because
having a il.issics department is es
sential to being a world- class uni
versity. Having a French Depart
ment, regardless of enrollment fig
ures. is as well," (iumbrec lit said.
I le also acknowledged, howev
er. that enrollment is high in the
department.
"French is never going to Ik.' the
nic >st popular major at Stanford, but
the department has clone a very
good job of increiLsing enrollment in
t lie | >ast f< >1 it years," C iumbrecht said.
"You expect thftt when enrollments
are growing, you should lx- able to
maintain the number of Faculty."
(iumbrecht said that while the
number of faculty in the French
Department had decreased, the
number of faculty in the (lompar
ative Literature Department has
risen, and that Comparative Liter

at lire professors can and do teach
French classes.

"We offer too few gi adnate-level
courses," Springer said.
Cierman Prof. kli/abeth Bern

guage (-enter, said she belies rs that
merging the departments tna\ en
able them to offer more courses.
"All Stanford students deserve to
have access to a wider arra\ oft hal
lenging classes at the adv.mt etl level
of instruction than we are currenth
able to offer," Bernhardt said. "I
still believe that efficiencies result
ing from restructuring would help
to provide more of the com si s that
we need."
Bernhardt also said having a
larger structure would enable Stan

"I remain hopeful that the

Bernhardt added.

(iiimbrecht concluded that he
does not want the uncertaintx sur
rounding the departments to con
tinue lor any longer.

" I hough Jell St hnapp and I
have opposing views about
whether or not to merge the de
partments, we would both prefer
them to make a decision—even
if it is t he opposite ol what we eat li
want — then lor it to continue on
for another year or two 01 three."
