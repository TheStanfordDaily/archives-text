### NICHOLAS CHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Wednesday marked not onh the beginning of the
new school year, but the beginning of preparations
for tlu* end, .is the Senior (llass presidents opened a
new Web site designed to field nominations for the
2002 Commencement speaker.
1 he new process follows the corifrovers\ that sur

rounded tfie selection of last year's Commencement
speaker, Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Mam
students protested the choice of Fiorina, asserting
that the decision had been made by the University
and not the students.
I his year, seniors will be more involved in the de
cision process. Through the Web site, members of
tfie Class of 2002 can submit nominations for the
speaker. I he nominating process will continue for
two weeks and end on Oct. 7.
()nce all the nominations are complete, the senior
class presidents will submit a list to University Presi
dent John Hennessy, who will officially invite indi
viduals from the list to be the speaker.
"Basically we just wanted to work very closely with
President Hennessy's office while at the same time se
curing a speaker that the senior class really pre
ferred," said Senior Class president Nick Larson. "By
making the process as public as possible, we felt that
we could accomplish these goals much more easily."
In contrast, last year's list ofcandidates was drawn
up by the senior class presidents, rather than the en
tire class.
Many seniors say they approve of the new process.
"Leveraging the Internet is the way to solicit the
many opinions and perspectives of our class," senior
Shad Ahmed said.
Senior Andres Small also approved of the Web
site.
" I he idea of a Web site where we can see who our
classmates have nominated ... indeed adds trans
patency to the process of formulating a recommend
ed speakers list," he said. "I also appreciated the ef
fort by our senior class presidents to publicize the
process"
I he Web site, http://classoP2oo2.stanford.edu, will
also print a list of nominees, so that seniors can stay
aware of the process.
The process will still involve some confidentiality.
President Hennessy will not disclose the ranks or
names of the potential speakers who receive invita-
