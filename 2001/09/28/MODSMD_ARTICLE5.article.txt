### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A common (riticism of the Stanford campus is that
keys only work in specific dorms and houses, making
it a challenge to visit students in oilier residences.
"When 1 go visil friends in other dorms, I usually
end up banging on the door until someone comes to
open it." sophomore Mark Miller s.iid. "Otherwise, I
have to walk around the building looking fora door
that's propped open."
I lie difficulties faced In Miller — and countless
other students — will end Monday, when Student
Housing Services will activate the Door King (iuest

Entry System.
As a continuation of Stanford's Capital Improve
ment Plan, housing services lias installed the Door
King system at the entrance to many student resi
dences, allowing easy entrance inside.
Each Door King system has access to a directon ol
the students in its respective residence. Il\ using die
"A"and "Z" keys to scroll through the directory,
guests can find the name of the student tliev want to
visit. Next to each student's name is a three-digit di
rectory code, which the visitor enters into the Door
King.
