DO YOUR PART
• Know your EAP! Each residence has an Emergency
Assembly Point (EAP). If you don't know where your
EAP is, go look for it or ask an RA before the drill.
• At your EAP account for all your house mates, especially those with
disabilities and report missing persons to your RA or RF.
• Do not re-enter buildings until emergency personnel have directed you
to do so.
Since this is the only time during the year that we practice what would happen in the event
of a fire, earthquake or bomb threat, please make the most of it! The better prepared we
are fora disaster, the sooner we will be able to return life on the Farm to its usual idyllic
state.
