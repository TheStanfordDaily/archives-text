Money Tree Myth Debunked
"I was a desperate man with a desperate need fora new car.
I was driven to this madness." — Dr. Oskie Stinks
Lunacy fora Lexus? Madness fora Mazda? It seems one researcher at a university in the East Bay
(we're too kind to mention the university 's name), experienced just that sort of insanity. (The
university in questioti has an ursine mascot.) Dr. Oskie Stinks announced last month that he had
genetically engineered an alder tree to actually grow money in place of leaves. The scientific commu
nity was astounded as it has been a well-established theory that money doesn t grow on trees. (School
colors are blue and gold.)
The unnamed university was delighted by the attention and awarded Dr. Stinks the new car he
had been wanting. (School's football team has lost liiif dame more times than their math depart
ment can calculate.)
Sadly, his theory was proven entirely ridiculous by a team of scientists in a third grade class in
Palo Alto. "Gee," said one of the eight-year-old researchers,' Why didn't he just go to the Enterprise Car
Sale and get his loan and car on sale?"
Why not, indeed? After all, Stanford Federal Credit Union is offering incredible loan rates along
with incredible Enterprise cars at its upcoming car sale. Dr. Stinks would have experienced:
• great selection of late-model, safety-inspected vehicles
• 12-month, 12,000 mile service agreement
• 7-day, buy-back option and more!
Plus, Dr. Stinks could have been preapproved for an SFCII auto loan and saved an additional 1/4%
off SFCU's already exceptional loan rates. (Offer of 1/4% discount valid only for preapproved loans
used at the Enterprise Car Sale on November 3,2001.)
Take a look at the rates at the- right and you'll see why Dr. Stink's decision to deceive WPPV!
the scientific community and embarrass an already tarnished university (school name
rhymes with PAL) was more than regrettable—it was pure madness. I onHor

Sadly, his theory was proven entirely ridiculous by a team of scientists in a third grade class in
Palo Alto. "Gee," said one of the eight-year-old researchers,' Why didn't he just go to the Enterprise Car
Sale and get his loan and car on sale?"
Why not, indeed? After all, Stanford Federal Credit Union is offering incredible loan rates along
with incredible Enterprise cars at its upcoming car sale. Dr. Stinks would have experienced:
• great selection of late-model, safety-inspected vehicles
• 12-month, 12,000 mile service agreement
• 7-day, buy-back option and more!
Plus, Dr. Stinks could have been preapproved for an SFCII auto loan and saved an additional 1/4%
off SFCU's already exceptional loan rates. (Offer of 1/4% discount valid only for preapproved loans
used at the Enterprise Car Sale on November 3,2001.)
Take a look at the rates at the- right and you'll see why Dr. Stink's decision to deceive WPPV!

rhymes with PAL) was more than regrettable—it was pure madness. I onHor

Money Tree Myth Debunked
"I was a desperate man with a desperate need fora new car.
I was driven to this madness." — Dr. Oskie Stinks
Lunacy fora Lexus? Madness fora Mazda? It seems one researcher at a university in the East Bay
(we're too kind to mention the university 's name), experienced just that sort of insanity. (The
university in questioti has an ursine mascot.) Dr. Oskie Stinks announced last month that he had
genetically engineered an alder tree to actually grow money in place of leaves. The scientific commu
nity was astounded as it has been a well-established theory that money doesn t grow on trees. (School
colors are blue and gold.)
The unnamed university was delighted by the attention and awarded Dr. Stinks the new car he
had been wanting. (School's football team has lost liiif dame more times than their math depart
ment can calculate.)
Sadly, his theory was proven entirely ridiculous by a team of scientists in a third grade class in
Palo Alto. "Gee," said one of the eight-year-old researchers,' Why didn't he just go to the Enterprise Car
