1969
On Sept. 26, 1969, I'he Daily printed an
article about Florence Moore I lull becom
ing coed:
"For the first time since it was completed
in 1956. Florent e Moore 11 .til is at commo
dating men.
I wo wings of its seven-wing complex,
(iardenal and I.oro, house 50 incoming
freshman men each, according to a plan ap
proved IÂ»v the University Board of trustees.
I he move extends the 'house plan' of
residential education to Moore for the first
time, it was pointed out, under a plan
I.nun lied nearlv live years ago to conduct
some general classes in residential units.
I'lie innovation also will allow more llexi
l)ilii\ in planning lor both Wilbur and Stern
ll.ills, which were pre\ iously designated as
coeducational two years ago.
Florence Moore will not actually become
a 'coeducational' dormitory, which means
men and women students sharing dining
l.u iluies and living (>n alternate floors of the
s.iiir' building, it was explained.
(lardenal and 1 .oro wings have separate
(lining rooms .is well as living areas."
Bottom Line: Going coed used to be such a huge
concern. Now it's SLE.
