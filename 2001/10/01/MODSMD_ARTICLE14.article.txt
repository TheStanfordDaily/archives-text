Brain structures that ore activated
b\ food or sex are also turned on b\
music, researchers reported . . .
[DrAnne Blood, a researcher at
Massachusetts General Hospital in
Charlestown, Mass.] and.. . Robert
Zatorre ofMcGill University in Mon
treal used positron emission tomogra
phy, or PET scans, to find which
areas of the brain are stimulated by
music that test subjects had said
caused "shivers doum the spine."
Dr. Ira Click, professor of psychia
try /in the/ Stanford University School
of Medicine, said music "is one way to
cope " in periods of stress, and it is
known that "behind every emotion
and every piece of behavior there is a
change in a molecule."
"With this new technology, the PET,
for the first time we can see it,"he
said. "It is exciting to see the biology
unfold before our eyes as we explore
the human mind.
