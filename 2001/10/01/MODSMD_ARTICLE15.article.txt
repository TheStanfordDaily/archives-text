## The 						Stanford Daily Hiring freeze is detrimental to the departments 
### 
Pubtithed Since IS')I

The one aspect of the proposed lan
guage department merger that every -
one can agree upon is that it has pro
duced mixed feelings among stu
dents, faculty and administrators.
Will combining six departments — Asian
Languages, Comparative Literature, French
and Italian, German Studies, Slavic Languages
and I jteratures and Spanish and Portuguese —
into one laige department create a vibrant, flex
ible program? ()r is the idea a budgetary deci
sion that will pit each language against each
othei in a struggle for resources?
We oppose the merger in general. If the Uni
versity would like to create a stronger language
program, it should do so In increasing funding
for the individual language departments, not by
simply consolidating them.
Although the study of many of the lan
guages is similar, there are also important dif-

ferences among them. (lomhining the depart
ments will blur the crucial distinctions be
tween them.
Faculty searches and hires within all six de
partments have been frozen until a committee
convened by Provost John Ftchemendy makes
its report. Kac h day the debate continues about
the future of languages at Stanford is another
day of distraction from scholarship and intellec
tual pursuits.
Fi ee/ing faculty searches and hires affects the
language deparments in two detrimental ways:
first, it injures the already understaffed depart
ments and second, it sends a negative message
about the importance of languages at Stanford.
One possible unintended consequence of
the hiring freeze is the decline of a depart
ment as student-faculty ratios rise and its re
sources are stretched. For example, the
French and Italian department has the high

est student enrollment-to-faculty ratio in the
School of Humanities and Sciences, accord
ing to Italian Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp. He pre
dicts a decline in the department's reputation
if it can't rebuild its faculty ranks.
The merger's proponents say that it will
create a stronger department. When Malcolm
Beasley, former dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, submitted the propos
al in March, he explained the new large: de
partment would have increased ability to com
pete for resources within Stanford. I he de
partment would have increased recruiting
power, he said, which will lead to higher-qual
ity faculty, higher-quality courses and more
graduate students.
II the administration feels so strongly
about promoting the language departments,
then it should see that the committee comes
to a conclusion quickly and the freeze is lift-

ed. Whether the result is six departments or
one big department, the professors and stu
dents need to be free to spend their time fo
cusing on scholarship and searching for the
best faculty members, not on the structure of
the department.
1 n general, informed debate and discussion
among the community and the affected par
ties is a good thing when important decisions
like this one are made. The committee has had
over three months to discuss tlu' merger. Now,
decisive action should be taken quickly to
untie the hands of the departments.
Although the merger is unadvisable, so too
is the current state of paralysis that the de
partments are in. The hiring freeze helps no
one. Whether the committee decides to go
ahead with the merger or not, it must do so
quickly so as to avoid irreparably harming the
individual departments.
