Errors in "language Departments
Frozen" story
I .1111 wilting hi poini out several errors
m the "Language departments frozen"
story in Friday's Daily.
I lie most important errot comes in the
fit st paragraph, \vhi< h refers to the "livpo
thelical Division of I.ileratures, Cultures
.ind languages'" I'he Division is not hypo
thetical; n currentlv exists (see www.Stan
ford.edu (leply I>l (.Iy).
W hat is "hvpol helical is the proposed
new sti in ture, whit li would merge the de
partments undci tlx* Division's purview
into a single department, fins fact is not
mentioned here; indeed, n is not men
tioned at all until the fourth column of the
siorv. 11 lis seems like an egregious over
sight. since the proposed merger is what
has caused all the controvers\ in the first
plat e. Also note that vour graph it does not
mat( It the corret t name of the di\ ision.
I'he largest problem with the story,
though, is that ii tails to give am back
ground for these events. Lhc Dailv repot t
ed on the incrgei in (he spring, hut the( in -
tent slotA tells us nothing about the merger
or wh\ it is being proposed. Since there are
no quotes from administrators, we don't get
that side of thestorv eithei. Not were an\
students interviewed.
I hope that these errors will be correct -
ed. This is a stor\ of ( rut ial important e to
man) fat ult\ and students at Stanford, and
sut h errot s ant I oversights make it difficult,
if not impossible, lot vour readers to un
derstand the issues at stake.

Student criticizes Jim Clark's decision
For ct'iilin ics, we had understood s< i
eiH e to be about getting to know things. Be
cause ol Silicon Valle\ and the unrestrained
blessings of Stanford, the notion of s( tenu
is now bring mutated into making profit
from knowing earlier tb.iu youi competi
tor. And the solid scientist melts into a vi
sionary entrepreneur, whose vision gtadu
all\ recedes in the black hole of personal in
terest.
"Squandering oui te< hnological future"
reads marvelouslv in " The New York
limes." Hut takeout glamor and corporate
c onditioning, and what you have is ,i pitiful
"Jeopardizing m\ investment on stem cell
research." thus "denying me .1 donoi 's law
ful right to milk pioneer Stanford research"
through joint < apital ventures and lucrative
contracts.
Nazi science was extremely advanced,
yet we condemn it for the evil master it
served. It'slime to see com inert ialization ;is
anothei suspicious masiet who threatens
st ientifit freedom by turning research into
a ct)inm<Klity neutral enough to Ik- bought
and sold.
In the meantime, we at Stanford Ix'have
like I'avlovian dogs, tlant ing to the tune of
baby-fKK>mer entrepreneurs. Oracle CKO

I'm the crucial point is this: as Bio-X
sponsor | ini (ilai k's donation .illet is onlv a
minorih of Si.infold employees, he has no
right to involve the rest of us, and Stanford
as a whole, in his guerrilla fight with the fed
eral government. We should refuse to be
come puppets in bis lobby ing games, and
we should make it t leai that bis private in
terests have nt) plat e at Sianftml.
If it's true that an entrepreneiu is a man
of action, we ex pet t Clark to act on his com
mitment to Stanford. I Ic either restores ot
