# Israeli troops kill three Palestinians
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — A Mideast truce remained
shaky yesterday, with Israeli troops fatally shooting
three Palestinians in the West Bank. Hie killings bring
the Palestinian death toll to 18 since the two sides
pledged last week to formalize a cease-fire.
No Israelis have been killed since the cease-fire
promises were made Wednesday, but Israel said its
troops have faced dozens of attacks in recent days as
the Palestinians have marked t|ie one-year anniver
sary of the current uprising with large street protests.
Israel said the Palestinians had two days to enforce
I heir part of the t ease-fire, or the latest truce was like
ly to fail as had earlier ones during the past year of
fighting.
I he Palestinians, meanwhile, said the mounting
death toll on the Palestinian side was the result ofex
(essive forte by Israeli troops. "We do not think that a
(ease-fire can be sustained under such circumstances,
where Israeli soldiers are obviously given orders to
shoot and kill at will," Palestinian Information Minis
ter Yasser Abed Rabbo said.
I nder the Israeli-Palestinian agreement readied
Wednesday, both sides were to take several steps by
Tuesday to ease tensions — and there were some
signs of action by both sides yesterday.
I he Israelis partially lifted a military blockade
around the West Kan k town of Jericho, an area that
lias been mostly quiet. Israel also reopened the border
crossing n controls between Egypt and the southern
end of the (iaza Strip.
In an unusual episode yesterday, Palestinian police

in Gaza fired tear gas at Palestinian teen-agers to pre
vent them from confronting Israeli troops at a border
crossing. In the past, Palestinian security forces have
rarely intervened to keep youths from moving toward
Israeli troops.
Still, the Palestinians were particularly upset about
the shooting deaths of two Palestinian workers near
the West Hank town of liilkarem.
Palestinian taxi driver Asmi Asm said that in the
pre-dawn hours yesterday, he and other drivers were
ferrying laborers to and 112 rom I ulkarem, near the bor
der with Israel. I he workers then intended to join the
thousands of Palestinians who evade roadblocks and
illegally slip into Israel each day to reach their jobs.
Asm said about halfway through the journey, near
the village of Silat e-l)har, the convoy came upon a pile
of rocks blocking the road. When some of the passen
gers began dismantling the barrier, Israeli troops con
cealed in a nearby olive grove opened fire, killing two
people and wounding six, he said.
In a statement, the Israeli military said it had set up
the roadblock lx*cause of a Palestinian shooting attack
nearby alx >ut 20 minutes earlier. Iwo taxis appr<>ac hed
the roadblock at high speeds Ix'fbre stopping.
l lie and passengers refused orders to get
out of the taxis. The taxis then "began driving wildly
in reverse," retreating from the soldiers and the road
block, the statement said. I lie soldiers tired at the tires
of the cars. When passengers got out and tried to run
away, "some of them were hit by the soldiers' fire," the
army statement added.
