WASHINGTON (AP) — ('.rimes motivated
by hatred lor a person's rate, religion or other
characteristics remain a tiny percentage of all
ollenses, the government reported yesterday,
based on samples lrom several states.
Ollenses known as "hate crimes" have at
tracted special scrutiny since the Sept. 1 1 ter
rorist attacks in New York and Washington.
rhe suspected hijackers — and those in
the al-Qaida network believed to have mas
terminded the deadly attacks — are mostly
Middle Kastern and Muslim. The govern
ment has said the hijackers lived in I .S. com
munities, sometimes for years, while prepar
ing lor the attacks.
Since the attacks, hundreds ol Americans ol
South Asian and Middle Kastern descent —or
just people with dark skin, beards, turbans 01
veils that make them appear to lit that pro
file— have been victims of threats, beatings
and even killings. Muslim mosques and tem
ples have been vandalized and lire-bombed.
FBI Director Robert Mueller said 1 hursda\
the bureau was investigating about 90 bate
(limes and would fully prosecute those who

turn their anger about the attacks onto inno
