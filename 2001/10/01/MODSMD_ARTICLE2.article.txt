## Professors call for patience and planning in campaign to eliminate terrorism 
### VAUHINI VARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the* wake of the terrorist attacks on
America of Sept. 11, a panel of six Stanford
professors came together at Kresge ~-
rium on Friday to discuss the terrorist ac -
tions and the U.S. response.
I he panel, sponsored by Stanford's Insti
tute of International Studies and the (-enter
for International Security and Cooperation,
represented the first time that a group of
Stanford experts have gathered to publicly
address the attacks.
The auditorium quickly filled to capa( ity,
with a diverse audience eager to hear the
thoughts of some of Stanford's most knowl
edgeable and distinguished scholars.
The panel consisted of Chip Blacker, a
member of the (loutic il on Foreign Relations
and the International Institute for Strategic
Studies; visiting fellow Laura Donahue;

I homas I Idler, .in authority on internation
al law; Christopher Chyba, a bioterrorism
expert; Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan;
and Philosophy Prof. Debra Sat/, the direc
tor of the Program in Ft hies in Society.
"Fveryone will be touched in one way or
another by the attacks," said lIS director
David I lolloway, who moderated the discus
sion. Holloway stressed the need for "pre
vention, protection and management of the
consecjuences of terrorism."
I he speakers focused predominantly on
the future — how America should respond
to the attacks, as well as the possible reper
cussions of its response.
I leller and Sat/ outlined the implications
of terrorist actions through the lens of inter
national law and political philosophy, re
spectively.
( h\ba spoke of the need to take seriously
the possibility of biological warfare, an issue
that lias recently become a topic of popular
fascination and is featured on the covets of
the latest editions of lime and Newsweek
magazines.

In the* wake of the terrorist attacks on
America of Sept. 11, a panel of six Stanford
professors came together at Kresge ~-
rium on Friday to discuss the terrorist ac -
tions and the U.S. response.
I he panel, sponsored by Stanford's Insti
tute of International Studies and the (-enter
for International Security and Cooperation,
represented the first time that a group of
Stanford experts have gathered to publicly
address the attacks.
The auditorium quickly filled to capa( ity,
with a diverse audience eager to hear the
thoughts of some of Stanford's most knowl
edgeable and distinguished scholars.
The panel consisted of Chip Blacker, a
member of the (loutic il on Foreign Relations
and the International Institute for Strategic
Studies; visiting fellow Laura Donahue;

I homas I Idler, .in authority on internation
al law; Christopher Chyba, a bioterrorism
expert; Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan;
and Philosophy Prof. Debra Sat/, the direc
tor of the Program in Ft hies in Society.
"Fveryone will be touched in one way or
another by the attacks," said lIS director
David I lolloway, who moderated the discus
sion. Holloway stressed the need for "pre
vention, protection and management of the
consecjuences of terrorism."
I he speakers focused predominantly on
the future — how America should respond
to the attacks, as well as the possible reper
cussions of its response.
I leller and Sat/ outlined the implications
of terrorist actions through the lens of inter
national law and political philosophy, re
spectively.
( h\ba spoke of the need to take seriously
the possibility of biological warfare, an issue
that lias recently become a topic of popular
fascination and is featured on the covets of
the latest editions of lime and Newsweek
magazines.
