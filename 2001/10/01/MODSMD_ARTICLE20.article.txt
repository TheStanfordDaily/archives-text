coverage and slanted toward the
middle ol the field. Kasani threw
.1 high ball and led Powell by
about 10 yards, where Powell
beat the I rojan secondary and
made the catch before being
brought down at the USC five
yard line. Junior running back
Kerrv ('alter, plunged across the
go.il line two plays later.
"Oil that play (Kasani and l|
were just eye to eye," Powell said.
"We knew what [the] other was
thinking, lie threw it in front of
the safety and I'm just glad he
and I were on the same page."
Kasani did not have the sm c ess
he lias had in previous games, but
still finished with 194 vards pass

also had three turnovers, two
fumbles and Ins first interception
of the season, a ball lie was fore ed
to throw into double coverage be
cause of I'SC lineman bearing
down on him in the pocket.
After the Trojans botched an
altered version of the flea-flic ker,

recovered Mc Cullough's fumble
on the I SC. 35. Two plavs later,

Powell's first of the season. Powell
finished with 124 yards on four
receptions. After Kernande/'s in
terception on the I SC. 37, the
(Cardinal widened its lead to 21-0
on <i two-yard p.iss to junior tight
end Brett Pierce.
"It really disappoints me that
we would go out and show that
kind of a first half," I SC coach
Pete Carroll said. "We made mis

down after Stanford's Eric John
son flopped a 36-yard punt to
Kevin Arbet, which he returned
47 yards to the Cardinal eight.
On the next play, McCollough
waltzed in on a sweep.
112 hen, with 6:34 left in the
game, Mike Biselli's 39-yard field
goal attempt was blocked by USC
cornerback Kris Richard, who
scooped up the ball and sprinted
65 yards untouched. After a

"We had a scare at the end and
that's a credit to the I SC. defense

" I 'hey never quit and we felt we

sion, the score stood 21-16.
"We had a scare at the end and
that's a credit to the I SC. defense

" I 'hey never quit and we felt we
had some letdowns [on offense]."
Kach team went three and out
in its next series, and Stanford
got the ball back on its own 27
