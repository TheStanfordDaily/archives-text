togetliei two victories at this week
end's Santa ('.lat a Adidas (.lassie.
On Fridav, the (Cardinal man

San Diego State in the first game
of tliis weekends tournament.
Stanford then culminated the
weekend with a 1-0 win over
Southern Methodist I niversity
on Sunday at Santa Claras Buck
Shaw Stadium.
San Diego State hung around a
lot longei than the( '.aiclinal would
have liked. I lie match remained
scoreless through the lii st 70 min
utes of play. Needless to say, the
game's low score wasn't for l.u k of
shooting, as the Cardinal ontshot
the Aztecs I 1-0 in the first half.
In the 70th minute, sophomore
forward Marcic Ward finally
ended the game's scoring
drought. Ward scored on an unas
sisted steal from the left side, heat
ing San Diego Slate's goalkeeper
on a hard blast.
Approximately I I minutes
later the Cardinal added another

note h into the s( oring column for
extra security.
Freshman midfielder Amy
(irad\ played a solid ball to junior
forward Man ia Wallis, who made
a spet ta< ular assist using her head
to pass the ball to wide-open
Ward. Ward went on to to seal the
deal, firing the ball p.i>t a helpless
A/tec goalkeeper.
San Diego State attempted to
close the gap late in the game.
A/tec sophomore forward Kim
( astcllanos managed to score San
I )iego State's only goal in the final
minutes of the second half, rob
bing the ('.ardinal of th.it ever-elu
sive collegiate match shutout.
Stanford easily dominated the
game, despite only winning by one
goal. Ihe Cardinal outshot San
Diego Stale 22-12, while senior
goalkeeper (larrie Wash recorded
five saves for Stanford.
Adding fuel to Stanford's victo
rious post-game celebration was
the lac I that ('.ardinal head coach
Andy Nelson pic ked up his 100 th
collegiate victory with the win over
San Diego State.
In only his second season, Nel
son has led the Cardinal to a 7-0
start and a 14-0-1 overall record
last year. With his l OOtli career
victory he improved his overall
coaching record to 100-35-10.
"It's a good mark to hit, and
we'll move forward from it," Nel
son said.
As in last week's tournament at
the Farm, the Cardinal seemed to
play much stronger despite com
peting against a better team on the
second day of tourney play.
On Sunday versus the more
competitive SMU, Stanford didn't
waste any time. Junior midfielder
Becky Myers scored early in the
first half on an assist from fellow
classmate and position holder
Kelsey Carlson, marking her first
goal of the season.
About 12 minutes later, Ward
and Wallis would combine once
again to lengthen Stanford's lead.
Ward scored with seeming ease
after a brilliant right cross from
Wallis left the Lady Mustang de
fense paralyzed.
The second half saw a more
aggressive Stanford offense and
a Cardinal defense that refused
to give up a single inch to visit
ing SMU.
Wallis scored early after the
break, as Carlson recorded her
second assist of the game. Fresh

man midfielder l.isa Engel would
score later in the second half on an
assist from sophomore midfielder
Brittany Oliveira.
The Stanford defensive unit,
led by senior fullback Amy Salter
and goalkeeper Walsh, looked
poised and tough throughout the
match, holding the l-ady Mus
tangs to only 11 shots on goal.
With each new victory the (Car
dinal confidence continues to
grow.
"1 think that we are a young
and talented team that will be a
force to be reckoned with," Wal
lis said. "I think that the team
that we have now has a new level
of competitiveness and confi
dence that we ciicl not have be
fore. As a team we expect to get
there and I know that we have
the ability to do so."
This Friday's match against
No. 10 Santa Clara, to be played
at New Maloney field at 7:30
p.m., will prove to be Stanford's
greatest test since their competi
tive yet fulfilling road victories in
both Florida and lexas earlier
this season.
