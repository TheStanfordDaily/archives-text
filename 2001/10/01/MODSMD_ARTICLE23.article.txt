•VI points between themselves
.ind the second place Aggies of
the I ('.-Davis.
Stanford dominated the team
competition in the Nk as well,
storing points to second-place
I Jtah State's ")M.
Following the high school
races earlier in the day, a stagger
ing amount of collegiate talent
stepped to the line fin the 4k.
I hire (lardinal runners in the
rat e, sophomores Don Sage and
(Itant Robison and junior Seth
Hejnv, competed in the finals of
the 2001 I rack and Field Cham
pionships last spring.
Sage plat ed fifth in 1,500 me
ters, while Robison and Hejny
finished lOtli and 13th in the
5,000 meters, respectively.
Also at the line for the Ik was
freshman Ryan I (all. third only to
Jim Ryun and Alan Webb in the
1,500 meters in American high

school history.
Senior Gabe Jennings — the
runner-up in the 1,500 meters at
NGAAs and an Olympian in the
same event.it the 2000 Olympic
Games in Sydney — was slated to
run as well hut was forced to save
his energy for another day due to
illness.
Also absent from the lineup at
the Invitational was sophomore
Louis I.tuhini, whose talent and
experience will help the (Cardinal
tremendously this season.
Even without these two phe
nomenal runners, Stanford
showed its ability and depth .is it
cruised to victory.
The Stanford pat k asserted its
position in front early in the 4k
race, allowing Jose Pelacios of Gal
State-Stanislaus to enjoy only a
short-lived lead. Robison took the
lead by the second mile and never
looked back.
"1 didn't really want to be in
front, but once I got there, I just
felt relaxed, like 1 was running
my pace," said Robison.
For Robison and the rest of the
Cardinal, that pace was fast —
very fast. Robison covered the
four kilometers in 10 minutes 54
seconds — a 4:24 mile pace.
Hcjny followed close behind,
crossing the line in second place
.it 11:02.
"Everyone on the team is in
great shape," he said. "Grant just
dropped the hammer."
Sage came in fourth (11:21),
followed by sophomore Philip
West in seventh (11:28) and


Sophomore Grant Robinson, who finished 10th at the 2001 Track and
Field Championships last spring, won the 4k race in the Stanford Invito
tional tournament this weekend with a 4:24 mile pace.
