# Long-awaited season opens for men's golf
## 
### MICHAEL W. ORME CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Operating on the quarter sys
tem has some definite pros and
cons at Stanford. On one hand, ii
allows students to pack their
schedules and earn unit-heavy en
gineering degrees in four years
with at least a little wiggle room.
On the other hand, it can wreak
havoc on a competitive golf sched
ule, according to Stanford men's
golf coach Jeff Mitchell.
"We're at a disadvantage he
cause we're on quarters," Mitchell
said. "We're already one or two
tournaments behind every team
on a semester schedule. Now it's
just a game of catch-up."
On Monday, the late-starting
Cardinal men kirk off their sea
son at the Husky Invitational at
the Washington National
Olympic Course in Bremerton,
Washington.
While Stanford wishes to pic k
up where they left off last season,
when they turned some heads by
qualifying for the NCAA National
Championships against poll pre
dictions, they will have to go up
against some teams that have al
ready been racking up tourna
ment honors this season.
Included in the 10-team field
is defending champion IVpper
dine, which has already recorded
two top-five finishes this season,
and host Washington, which is
fresh off a second-place finish. In
addition, Pacific 10 Conference
rivals California, Oregon, Ore
gon State and Washington State
should make matters tough for
the Cardinal.
"The Pac-10 is one of the
toughest conferences in the coun
try," Mitchell said. "Every team
except Washington State is in the
national top-45 coaches poll, and
Washington State has already won

a tournament. With strong teams
like |N0.21 Arizona and [No. H|
Arizona State, the conference
makes a strong showing vear in
and year out."
Rounding out the field are ( ol
orado, Nevada and Ceorgia
Southern.
"It's the smallest field we'll play
all year, but it's also a great oppor
tunity for us to play some very
good goll teams." Mitchell said.
"Kven lower-ranked teams like
Colorado and Ceorgia Southern
have been playing extremely well,
.ind every other team has alreadx
been playing in college tourna
ments. I lopelully, it'll be a chance
for us to start on a good note."

Mitchell will be looking to se
nior Phil Rowe and Junior Jim
Seki to lead the (Cardinal this vear.
Both Rowe and Seki have exten
sive tournament experience, with
Rowe garnering second-team All-
Conference honors last year and
Seki leading Stanford at last war's
NCAA Championships with a lie
for 37th.
In addition, sophomores Blake
Malastii and Ron Won will look to
prove their mettle for Stanford
alter limited tournament expo
sure last year. |unior Del <le
Windt, who is returning after tak
ing a year oil with an internship,
will be looking to get bat k into the
swine of collegiate golf. I wneri

cured junioi (ieorge Downing will
also Ik- competing.
While the ( ardinal ina\ he a hit
behind the game in terms of tour
nament experience this season, il
still luis time to prove itself, and
Mitchell .tnd his Stanford men
have lolt\ goals lot both the regu
lar and postseason.
"We want to take it one tourna
ment .it .t lime," Mitchell said.
"We're looking to win one or two
tournaments and hopelulh finish
m the top three in the l\u -10 and
the top-10 at Nationals. I think
these are attainable goals, because
this is a <ledi( aled team and ihe\ II
work .is hard as thev (an to get the
i< >b done."


The 2001 men's golf team will see its first action tonight at the Husky Invitational at the Washington National Olympic
Course in Bremerton, Wash.
