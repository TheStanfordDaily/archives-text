### CAROLYN LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Taube Family Foundation
provided a big boost to Stanford's
Jewish Studies program last
Wednesday, pledging $2.5 million
to create the Taube Center for
Jewish Studies.
"The endowment underwrites
our activities, a lot of which, up to
this point, were based on year-by
year donations," said I fistory Prof.
Aron Rodrigue, one of the new co
directors of t he center. "The en
dowment makes [our program| in
dependent of that. We are on a
much firmer footing, financially."
An additional $2.2 million in
matching funds will come 112 rom the
Hewlett Foundation's $400 mil
lion gift to the School of Humani
ties and Sciences. An earlier I'aube
donation of $000,000 and a match
ing gift from San Francisco's Koret
Foundation bring the c enter's total
endowment to about $5 million.
The gift will facilitate the ex
pansion of the Program on Jewish
Studies, which has already been"a
center in all but name for many
years," according to History Prof.

Steven Zipperstein, Rodrigue's co
director.
"| The Program on Jewish Stud
ies has] done much of what major
research centers do," Zipperstein
said. "We're a center for both grad
uate-student and faculty research.
"The main journal in the field
has been published here for the
last several years," he continued.
"()ne of the leading books on Jew
ish studies, co-edited by [ Ro
drigue] and me, was published
here at the Stanford University
Press."
Although faculty members have
yet to make specific plans for the
funding, Zipperstein said they are
exploring various options, includ
ing graduate student-initiated
conferences and joint publishing
ventures with the University Press.
Along with increased scholarly
exchanges and public activities,
Rodrigue said the funding may
bring additional exposure to the
international facet ofJewish Stud
ies at Stanford.
"We have always sponsored in
ternational activities, and we want
to continue and expand the inter
national angle <>l the program,"
lie said.
Stanford alumnus lad lanbe,
head ol the l anbe Famil\ Founda
tion and president of the koret
Foundation, played a large role in
establishing the new center.
"I tame to the decision really
rathet readily," 1 aube told the
Stanford Report. "It provided li
nalit\ to some 15 years of eflort
and personal involvement with

starting the Program on jewish
Studies at Stanford in 1986. At
