## The 						Stanford Daily Monster Trak is safeguarding student privacy 
### 
Published Sitice IS 1 )!

Last month. The Privacy Foundation,
an Internet privacy group, released a
report accusing Monster.coin and
Monster Trak — the service that Stan
lord students and the Career Development
Center now use lor job searching — ol insuffi
cient privacy protection lor those who use its
Web sites.
I he report accused Monster.coin of dis
cussing the sale of personal data to other
marketers and of passing personally identi
fying data to its business partner, AOL
I ime Warner. Although the report did not
accuse Monster.coin of any illegal ac tions, it
said that users' privacy was inadequately
protected. Not surprisingly, the report con
cerned some students and administrators
who felt that students' information might
be compromised.
Students should not be worried about

their privacy, though, since MonsterTrak and
Monster.coin are separate entities that do not
share each others data. Although
Monster.coin bought Job Irak this summer, it
runs Job Irak as an independent entity. The
two sites have different employees, different
databases and different servers. I he data
from the two is not mingled.
Whatever Monster.coin does with the re
sumes of its customers does not affect those
on MonsterTrak. Stanford studentsonh have
to worry about Monstcr.coin's privacy prac -
tices if they sign up at that Web site indepen
dently of the CI)(
At this point, Monster Trak retains the
features of Job Irak.coin. Those who were
not worried about their privacy on lob-
Irak.com have no reason to be concerned
about Monster Irak.
Stanford students formerly used Job-

Trak.com in conjunction with the CDC to
post resumes, search for jobs and sign up for
interviews. The site gave students the choice
to keep their resume private or to make it
available to any employer that paid to review
the pool of student resumes. Students there
lore could control the level of privacy for their
personal information, a desirable feature of
the Web site.
job-seeking is an inherently revealing
process. I hose looking for jobs willingly
send all sorts of personal data, such as their
CPA, to complete strangers as part of their
resumes. Some people are willing to broad
cast their resumes as widely as possible to in
crease their chances of getting a job. But
they do so with the expectation that their
personal data will not be resold to other
companies or used for other purposes. I bis
sort of use would be unethical.

Having MonsterTrak under the
Monster.com umbrella may cause some prob
lems, though. It is possible that Monster.com
could integrate the two now-separate
databases at some point in the future. In
doing so, it would possibly compromise stu
dent privacy bv exposing or selling student
data to other marketers or business partners.
We urge the CDC to keep abreast of Monster-
Irak's privacy practices in the future so stu
dent information is not affected il the compa
ny alters its business model.
Although The Privacy Foundation's report
raises some concerns about Monster.com, its
accusations do not apply to MonsterTrak and
not to Stanford, either. I bis fall, therefore,
students should post their resumes and
search for jobs without worrying that their
personal data will be distributed unethically
or improperly.
