horrifying, criminal attacks on the

In fact, they — the great majority of
Arabs and Muslims — do not hate us.
the American people. Americans who
travel to the Arab or Muslim world are
usually welcomed and treated with
great generosity.
However, many Arabs and Muslims
who would never condone or commit
ads ol terror such .is those perpetrated
on Sept. II have become increasingh
angered by the foreign policy ol the
United States government and its im
pact on tlie Middle East.
1 he criminal and fanatic fringe ol po
litical Islam — elements like (Xsama bin
Laden and the al-Qaeda organization —
has emerged from this broader anger,
which has been brewing for manv vears.
Yet because most Americans know so lit
tle about the Middle East, they do not
know why our government's policies are
so disliked.
I lie longest standing grievance is the
Arab-Israeli conflict. 1 his has been exac
erbated by Israel's disproportionate use
of force in attempting to suppress the
Palestinian uprising over the last year,
which has been extensively broadcast on
Arab television.
I he sight of American-supplied E-16
fighters and Apache helicopters bomb
ing civilian targets and carrying out over
50 extra-judicial assassinations has
raised opposition to the American-Is
raeli alliance to new levels.
I he United States has effectively sup
ported Israel's .'l4-year occupation of the
West Bank, the Gaza St rip and East
Jerusalem. It provides Israel with nearly
$. r > billion in aid every year, nearly one
third of the I nit eel States' entire foreign
aid budget.
Our government has vetoed or
threatened to veto dozens of U.N. Secu
rity Council resolutions critical of Is
rael's annexation of East Jerusalem, its
establishment of settlements in the occu
pied territories, or its denial of Palestini
an human rights. Most recently, a
threatened American veto removed a
resolution to establish .in international
force to protect Palestinians in the occu
pied territories from the Security Coun
cil's agenda.
The Reagan administration gave Is
rael a green light to invade Lebanon in
1982, an operation resulting in some
17,500 civilian casualties. As many as
2,000 innocent Palestinians were slaugh
tered in the Sabra and Shatila refugee

camps in wake ol tin- Israeli invasion.
I 11.11 mass, Hie was partK facilitated
l>\ the lad that I S. Marines who had
been dispatched to protect Palestinian
civilians in Lebanon It-It precipitously
lca\ing the Palestinians to the mercies ol
then Lebanese and Israeli enemies.

blight on "<»() Minutes" about this high
level of human suffering. Ms. Albright
responded. "We think it's worth it."
()thers may beg to diller.
When the American embassies in
kenva and Tanzania were bombed in
1998, the C.linton .idininistration ac
cused Osama bin Laden of responsibili
ty. In addition to firing cruise missiles at
him in Afghanistan, the onlv pharma
ceutical plant in Sudan — built In bin
Laden's construction company — was
destroved on the grounds that traces ola
chemical involved in the embassy bomb
ings were found there.
The C.linton administration later
quietly admitted th.it its intelligence on
the involvement ol the pharmeccutical
plant was mistaken, hut when Sudan
requested that the I nited Nations in
vestigate the incident, the I nited States
blocked the investigation. Mow many
innocent people died needlessly be
cause this intelligence error deprived
them of medicine? Was it necessary to
act so precipitously?
These and oilier grievances, no mat
ter how' legitimate and sincerely felt. can
in no way justify the attack on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. Those
attacks were crimes against humanity,
and their perpetrators should be cap
tured .uul brought to justice. There is a
difference between a justification and an
explanation.
The grievances mentioned bete, and
others, do explain the deep sense ofout
rage and frustration felt widely
throughout the Arab and Muslim world
over the United States' foreign policy in
the Middle Last.
Before we embark on a long cam
paign against a shadowy enemy, it
would be useful to know something
about the historical and social condi
tions thai nurtured the fury of those
who attacked us on Sept. I 1.
