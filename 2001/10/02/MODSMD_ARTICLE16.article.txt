Don't restrict foreign student visas
Before ni\ husband. Political Science
Prof. Lmeritus Hubert Marshall, retired
Iroin the Political Science Department,
one of the high points of his year was giv
inga talk at the Bechlel International (leti
tei to incoming foreign students 011 Amer
ican government and politics. Members of
the audience were knowlctlgable, bright
and cur'ions to know more about the I nit
ed States. Their varied backgrounds made
fora lively discussion.
Now, in a mindless reaction to the
tragedy ol Sept. 11, Calif. Sen. Diatine Te
instein is proposing to ban all foreign stu
dent visas for six months, with no guaran
tee that the ban won't be renewed at the
end oft hat time. Such an action amounts to
,111 especially d uel form of collective pun
ishment, one that targets voting people at a
crucial point iu their lives and could seri

ously disrupt their careers. It is also point
less and counterproductive. Why not ban
all foreigners? If terrorists are unable to
entei the I nited States as students, they
will figure out some other way.
Among the t liicf victims of such a ban
would be Stanford and the hundreds of
other American colleges and universities
that are host to foreign students. These
schools would lose not only tuition, but
more importantly, the diversity and en
richment that foreign students bring to
the classroom and to dorm life. Our na
tional response to terrorism should not
take the lot 111 of xenophobia, nor should
we allow certain groups to be singled out
lot punishment. I hope the Stanford com
munity will pressure Keinstein to with
draw her damaging proposal. Please call
her office at (-115) 'HW-0707.
