I here are three lradilion.il Christian
positions on war. I he liist is pacifism,
which held swax loi the lit si ilnee ten

I he seeond is just war theorv, which was
first articulated In S.iini Augustine,
among others, aftei the Linperoi ( on

Urban II in 1095 to liberate Jerusalem
and the Christian I lol\ Lands fioin the
Muslims, whom the Pope tailed wicked,
accursed and alienated from (iod.
Let's start with crusade, also tailed
holy war. President Ceorge W. Push
used the word "crusade" to desciibe
America's planned response in the earlx
days following Sept. 11. but (|uickl\
dropped the term.
An eminent scholar of Islam .11 (leoi ge
town Universitv, )ohn Lsposito, wrote a
decade ago that "few events had .1 more
shattering and long-lasting effect on Mils
lim-Chi istian relations than the Cru
sades .. . . For Muslims, the nieniorx <>l
1 he ('.rusades lives 011 as the (learesi exam
ple of militant Christianiiv. an earlier
harbinger of the aggression and impel ial
ism of the (Ihristian West."
I here are lew theologians t<»<fax who

would defend the concept ol Christian
liolx w.ii 01 11 usade. Ii has traditionallx
involved applx ing an absolutist good-vei -
siis-e\il distinction not |iist to enenn mill
tan forces, but to whole peoples. Cru
saders have repudiated not 0111\ ex il deeds
111.11 the eneniv does, but also the eneinx .is
.1 whole. Matters of degree have been
inor.ilh irrelevant Ironi at 1 usadci view
point. (iod has been seen to champion
<>11 Ix one side and not lament the loss ol
enenn lives. Lhe crusader's view is moral
l\ simplistic , seeing conflict as an eithei -or,
.1 bailie between pure good and unadul
terated evil, there is an assumption too
that .1 ciusade (.111 eradicate evil people
and ellects once and loi all. without the
risk of bringing on new ex ils that max be
evei \ bit as bad — or ex en worse — than
the one that is ( urrentK being fought.
A more niainstreain position ol Chris
tian theologians and ethicists these days,
recent 1\ 1 eitei ated In Pope John Paul 11. is
that of |iisi war. S.iini \uguslineexplained
