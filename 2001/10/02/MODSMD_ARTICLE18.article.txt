## Student-run television station looks to generate enthusiasm, interest in programming 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM 
New management h.is taken over SCBN,
Stanford's stiident-rim television station, with
hopes oi resurrecting a i ainpus institution that
in recent years has come to he .ill hut ignored
by the student hod).
Employing "a communist rhetoric" In dub
bing S('.BN "the people's station." new (iener
al Manager senior Ilva Lyashevskv said he
plans to revitalize the station h\ enabling stu
dents interested in television to produce their
own shows.
Senior (ireg Ruth, SCBN's new director of
public relations, explained, "It is realK a com
plete grassroots thing. We want to serve .is a di
rect link between kids with ideas and .1 desire to
produce and the 1 hancc to do so."
However, generating participation has not
been easv. In recent vears, limited and incon
sistent programming has failed to stimulate in
terest on campus and has left students indiffer
ent to or even conipletelv ignorant of S( BN
and the possibilities it olfet s.
"I feel like people think of SCBN as prett\
much superfluous, that it prett) much is
nonexistent in terms of Stanford program
ming." said senior Allegra 1 < heveriia ."I never
really even thought of ('.hanuel 5 .is S( BN
Even Senior Brandon Paulson. S( BN's new
programming manager, admitted that the sta
tion has not been \ iewed .is .1 legitimate student
enterprise in the past.
Paulson s.iid he long believed that S( BN ex
isted onlv to show " I'elcElicks" — rehroadcast
Hollywood films purchased b\ Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises — "and nothing else."
l lie station's recent struggles have been

due largelv to problems with resources and
management structure, according to several
students.
Senior Einilv Maudelhaum, formerly a pro
duce! .it S( PN, opted not to he involved with
the station this vear largely out of frustration.
"S( BN suffered from people not being
able to follow through on things," said
Mandelbaum.
She added that in recent years, there was
interest from students in making shows, but
SCBN could not provide these students with
equipment, l ast vear, only a few episodes of
Stanford-produced shows were aired on the
c hannel.
Recent management was reluctant to spend
the station's $20,000 budget, leaving SCBN
with inadequate or broken equipment.
"There's no consistency among the station
managers." Mandelbaum said. SCBN has no
formal managerial training process and has
gone through four difleient managers in as
many years.
Cognizant of these obstacles, l.vashevsk)
has taken over for former station manager
kinglsev W illis. However, he and the lest of
the new SCBN staff do not have an v significant
experience in broadcasting.
Planning for the new S( BN remains in the
carlv stages.
"We're getting read) to air feleElicks this
week, and that is the extent of the program
ming," said Paulson.

For now, organi/ers arc locused on estab
lishing a groundwork upon which SCIIN can
thrive. Ruth said lie lecls that the station's siu
cess will hinge upon the student bodv's willing
ness to get involved and S( K\\ ahilii\ to serve
as a vehicle to broadt ;ist their visions.
"We're not trying to produce the content,
we're trying to get people e\< ited," Ruth said.
"II the Stanford commit nit\ as a whole decides
it wants to make S( UN good, then ii will he. A
lot ol that is pretty nuu I) beyond our power."

gressively and ensuring that resources will be
available to interested students.
S( UN leaders plan to work with other stu
dent organizations to broadcast their pro
gramming and to iiu t ease announcements at
house and dorm meetings.
In response to shortages of equipment, the
station hopes to pun base new cameras so that
demand will never exceed supplv.

Stanford's stiident-rim television station, with
hopes oi resurrecting a i ainpus institution that
in recent years has come to he .ill hut ignored
by the student hod).
Employing "a communist rhetoric" In dub
bing S('.BN "the people's station." new (iener
al Manager senior Ilva Lyashevskv said he
plans to revitalize the station h\ enabling stu
dents interested in television to produce their
own shows.
Senior (ireg Ruth, SCBN's new director of
public relations, explained, "It is realK a com
plete grassroots thing. We want to serve .is a di
rect link between kids with ideas and .1 desire to
produce and the 1 hancc to do so."
However, generating participation has not
been easv. In recent vears, limited and incon
sistent programming has failed to stimulate in
terest on campus and has left students indiffer
ent to or even conipletelv ignorant of S( BN
and the possibilities it olfet s.
"I feel like people think of SCBN as prett\
much superfluous, that it prett) much is
nonexistent in terms of Stanford program
ming." said senior Allegra 1 < heveriia ."I never
really even thought of ('.hanuel 5 .is S( BN
Even Senior Brandon Paulson. S( BN's new
programming manager, admitted that the sta
tion has not been \ iewed .is .1 legitimate student
enterprise in the past.
Paulson s.iid he long believed that S( BN ex
isted onlv to show " I'elcElicks" — rehroadcast
Hollywood films purchased b\ Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises — "and nothing else."
l lie station's recent struggles have been

due largelv to problems with resources and
management structure, according to several
students.
Senior Einilv Maudelhaum, formerly a pro
duce! .it S( PN, opted not to he involved with
the station this vear largely out of frustration.
"S( BN suffered from people not being
able to follow through on things," said
Mandelbaum.
She added that in recent years, there was
interest from students in making shows, but
SCBN could not provide these students with
equipment, l ast vear, only a few episodes of
Stanford-produced shows were aired on the
c hannel.
Recent management was reluctant to spend
the station's $20,000 budget, leaving SCBN
with inadequate or broken equipment.
"There's no consistency among the station
managers." Mandelbaum said. SCBN has no
formal managerial training process and has
gone through four difleient managers in as
many years.
Cognizant of these obstacles, l.vashevsk)
has taken over for former station manager
kinglsev W illis. However, he and the lest of
the new SCBN staff do not have an v significant
experience in broadcasting.
Planning for the new S( BN remains in the
carlv stages.
"We're getting read) to air feleElicks this
week, and that is the extent of the program
ming," said Paulson.

For now, organi/ers arc locused on estab
lishing a groundwork upon which SCIIN can
thrive. Ruth said lie lecls that the station's siu
cess will hinge upon the student bodv's willing
ness to get involved and S( K\\ ahilii\ to serve
as a vehicle to broadt ;ist their visions.
"We're not trying to produce the content,
we're trying to get people e\< ited," Ruth said.
"II the Stanford commit nit\ as a whole decides
it wants to make S( UN good, then ii will he. A
lot ol that is pretty nuu I) beyond our power."
lo create this participation and remedy
past problems, S( .K\ is advertising more ag
gressively and ensuring that resources will be
available to interested students.
S( UN leaders plan to work with other stu
dent organizations to broadcast their pro
gramming and to iiu t ease announcements at
house and dorm meetings.
In response to shortages of equipment, the
station hopes to pun base new cameras so that
demand will never exceed supplv.
"\\ ere tr\ing to take stot kol our existing
equipment," s.tid Paulson. "The budget from
last Near was not used. Wet e hoping to petition
successfully to get i ontrol ol those funds."
I he channel plans to open Ihe war with a
recorded show dot umenting 112 ull Moon on the
Quad, establishing the station's pi esctue .it the
start of the vear.
(lurrenth, this is the onK origin.il show
st heduled.
"At this point, we don't really have am es
tablished shows. 1 o be honest, we're not being
pit ky or t lioosn ." Ruth s.iid. "1 think we know
we have our work cut out for us. and there's
only so much you can do in a Near. II we're
truly successful, In the end ol the nc.ii we'll be
turning people down left and right."
