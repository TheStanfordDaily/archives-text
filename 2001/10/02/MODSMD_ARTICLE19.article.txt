1 he Cardinal (9-1, 3-0 Pacific
10 (Conference) started the season
with four matches on the Kast
('oast before swinging its way
through Texas fora pair of con
tests with top-25 opponents
Texas and Texas A&M. The
weekend ofSept. 20, the Stanford
squad returned to the West ('.oast
to post wins over Pac-10 Conler
ence foes Washington and Wash
ington State.
Last Tuesday the (lardinal fi
nally broke into California,
dropping its only match of the
season at No. 1 long Beach
State, .ind this past I rida\ Stan
lord returned to the Bay Area
when the\ traveled to Berkeley
to trample (California.
Tonight, the road-weary (lar
dinal squad makes one last stop,
just clown Highway 101 at Santa
Clara to face the No. 24 Broncos

(8-4), before at hist getting to
play a match in the friendly con
fines of Maples Pavilion on
Thursday against ()regon.
"It's nice to be around town,"
said Stanford head coach |ohn
Dunning. "Santa Clara is nearby,
and then we have three matt lies .it
home, and we definitely can't wait
to play in our home gym "
I he journey hascertainh been
successful for Stanford, w hicli has
risen from a No. 10 preseason
ranking to its current spot .it No.
•i. And the team's 8,000 miles <>l
travel this season have been made
signifu antly easier In ,i number of
pleasant surprises that have fallen
on the squad.
l he success of freshman out
side hitter Ogonna Nnamani cer
tainly ranks at the top of the list.
The 2000 Catorade National
High School Player of the Year
has burst onto the college scene,
averaging 3.94 kills per game and
ranking third on the team in digs
and service aces after starting in all
10 of the Cardinal's matches.
Another surprise has come
from the strong play of fifth-ycai
senior setter and co-captain
Kobyn Lewis. After running the
Cardinal's oflense in 1998, lewis
was sidelined by a knee injun for
the past two years, but she h.is re
turned strong in her final (.1111-
paign to average 12.79 assists pei
game, placing her third in the
Pac-10.
11 it- (lardinal's strong bl<x king
of H.(). r > l)lo< ks per game is
currently ranked lirst in the con
ference and has been another
pleasant surprise. Senioi middle
blocker I'ara Conrad lias been
pating Stanford with 1.4.'i blocks
per game, but the Cardinal has
.ilso seen strong showings from
sophomore middle blockers |enn
I larvey and Sara Mc( lee, who are
also each averaging at least one
block per game.
()l no surprise, ol course, lias
been the continued dominance of
11111i<>i outside hitler I ogan I out.
I lie two-time All-Ameriian and
I S. National leant tnetnbei
leads the team in kills, dius, and

servii e aces and has posted double
digit kill lot.lis in Stanford's lasl 25
mate lies
Against S.inta C.lara, Stanford
will look t«> legain its composure
allei two sub-pat performances in
its last two outings.
I lie ("animal's passing and
(onununi< ation broke down se
vere!) late in its 1 loss to Long
llcac h Stall* last rucsdav, and sim
ilai problemst rept upon theteam
.it times flut ing its sweep ovei the
Bears on I rida\.
I <>da\ and I lie last (<mpli* ol
davs we've been talking about re
laxing with each other, because
the whole world is |iimp\ right
now. and we've been through so
much travel latch." Dunning said.
"Most passing problems come
from being tense and not being
comfortable with ilie person next
tO Mill."

I Ik- Broncos arc coming oil .1
dominating 3-0 win over West
('.oast Conference rival Saint
Mary's on Saturday, a win that
snapped a three-match losing
streak lor Santa (ilara.
I he young Broncos' squad —
Santa (lat a has only lour upper
(lassmen on its roster — lias been
driven l>\ its strong defense this
\ eai. avei aging nearl\ 19 digs per
game.
But Santa (Haras net game,
u I in li has only come up with two
blocks in eat li <>l the Broncos' l.ist
three matches, has left something
to be desired.
II Stanford's passing is on, the
Broncos' three freshmen middle
blockers— I'oni Muratore, Jen
nifer Rvan. and (Ihristina Vick —
will likely be overwhelmed by
loin, Nnamani, and the rest of
