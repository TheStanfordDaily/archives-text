Alter spending her freshman
yeai ithout a car, sophomore Jill
Camarena was finally able to get
her car this year.
"I am from the Sacramento
area and thought I would be able
to go home on the weekends," she

said. "Km without a car, my par
ents would have to drive down
and pick me up and then find a
way to get me back to school be
cause they were both working."
Many resident assistants agreed
that thecal policy has also affected
stall'members in freshman dorms.
"It makes it much more diffi
cult to do not only dorm pro
gramming, but also the spur-of
the-moment activities |that we try
to plan]," said senior Lindsay
Arnold, an RAin ('.echo.
Some RAs s.iid they are put in
.i difficult situation because if
they don't feel comfortable
lending out their cars, they end
up driving freshmen from one

place to another.
But junior Lynn Yee, an RAin
Branner, said she It-els the situa
tion is not as bad as some people
claim. "So far it hasn't been a big
deal," she said. "It hasn't (had an
impact on) the stall at all."
Yee explained that some fresh
men use the cars of older siblings
or friends who have gone abroad.
Although no new transporta
tion services have been added tins
year, all of those instituted last
year remain in service. These in
clude three new Marguerite lines:
the Shopping Express, with
weekend trips to the Stanford
Shopping Center and the San
Antonio Center; the Menlo Park

Route, with lines during peak
commute times from Stanford to
the* Menlo Park Station; and the
Midnight Express, with service
around campus and Palo Alto
from K p.m. to midnight.
Transportation Services will
also continue the Movie Express,
a free Eriday night service to the
Merc ado Center in Santa Clara,
home to AMC I heat res, Ben and
Jerry's Ice Cream and other
restaurants. According to juditli
Biller from the ()lfu e of Student
