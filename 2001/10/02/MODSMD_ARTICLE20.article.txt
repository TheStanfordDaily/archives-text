## 
### AMANDA CANEVARO EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
Sure, Stanford values the Sears
Cup, conference tides and all the na
tional championships. But as any
Stanford student will tell you, equal
ly important are bragging rights
over East Bay rival California.
Thursday night the women's vol
leyball team notched the Cardinal's
first win of the year against rival ('.al
with a convincing 3-0 sweep.
The win was the 37th in a row
over the Bears by No. 4 ranked
Stanford (9-1,3-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), which improved its all-time
record against Cal (3-5,0-3) to 48-3.
The match gave first-year head
coach John Dunning his first taste of
the Cal-Stanfbrd history.
"I'm not feeling the rivalry yet,"
Dunning said. "1 think it's going to
take a little time to get into it. I love
tradition and 1 was big on traditions
with my old program, but to really
feel a tradition you have to be a part
of it for some time."
"I've been here lx-fore [as head
coach of Pacific for 16 years], and it
was certainly different Ix-ing here
with Stanford because people are
really hollering out of the stands at
you," he said.
All 14 Cardinal players saw play
ing time, and the constant lineup
c hanges put the team's chemistry to
the test.
l he win was certainly not Stan
ford's prettiest of the year, as the
team ran up 15 service errors and
got caught on rotation violations

twice, but the Cardinal still played
remarkably well with several unusu
al lineups on the floor.
"Tonight we were doing a lot of
subbing because we thought if the
match was close or not, we wanted
to get a lot of people action who
were working hard in practice and
deserved it," Dunning said. "We'd
never practiced some of those line
ups before, so to do it in front of
people in a game and have it work
is awesome."
The crowd of more than 1,4(X),
which included the Cal band and
Rally Committee, rarely let Haas
Pavilion fall silent, giving the Cardi
nal's three freshmen their first expe
riences with rowdy (l;il fans.
"It's a great rivalry, and it's an
honor to fx' at a school with that
much spirit and to play in such a
competitive match-up," said fresh
man outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani. "Ideally, ifyou're in a rhythm
or really l<x used, you can block out
all of the heckling, but it can get
through sometimes, so you just have
to ignore it,"
Nnamani did just that and
recorded 11 kills for the Cardinal,
while junior Logan Tom notched a
match-high 12 kills and 12 digs.
(landace McNamee led (lal with just
nine kills, as Stanford outhit Cal
.261-.078 and held the Bears to just
31 kills in the match.
