# Five Pac teams stay undefeated
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN 
After two weeks of play, the Pacific 10 Conference
continues to be top-heavy as live teams, including
Stanford (3-0, 2-0 Pat-10), remain undefeated. The
conference has six teams in contention fora bowl
game as league play continued into its second week
without any major upsets.
Seventh-ranked Oregon (4-0, 1-0) continued its
winning wavs with a 38-21 victory over independent
Utah State (0-4). 1 he Ducks were led by Heisman
Trophy-candidate |oey Harrington, who completed
17 of 24 attempts for 261 yards and two touchdowns.
Harrington also scrambled into the end zone fora
touchdown in the second quarter.
Despite the victory, ()regon did not dominate the
Aggies as many people had expected. Oregon only
led by three points, 24-21, at the end of the third
quarter. 1 larrington then took control of the fourth
quarter, responding to the team's meager three
point advantage by engineering an 80-yard scoring
drive. I lie Ducks were also helped by running back
Maurice Morris, who ran for 175 yards and a touch
down on 22 carries.
Oregon's inability to dominate the Aggies has al
lowed UCLA to gain ground in the polls. The No. 9
Bruins (4-0,1-0) dominated Oregon State (1-2, 0-1),
causing the Beavers to drop out of the national top
25. The Bruins played an amazing all-around game,
gaining 496 yards on offense while holding the
Beavers to 220 yards on offense.
I he Beavers have had UCLA's number the past
two years, scoring 99 points in the two contests. Fi
nally, under new defensive head coach I'hil Snow,
the Bruins were able to stop the Beavers' offense, tak
ing a 17-0 lead into halftime.
The Bruins were led by the other I leisman candi
date in the Pac-10, running back Deshaun Foster.
Foster rushed for 147 yards and three touchdowns
on 31 carries. He is currently leading the Pac-10 with
502 yards in the team's four games, making him the
nation's ninth leading rusher.
The preseason favorite for the nation's best run
ning back was Oregon State's Ken Simonton, who
rushed fora career low 26 yards against the Bruins. Si
monton has been shut down this year, rushing for only
237 yards, allowing Foster to step into the limelight.
UCLA also saw strong play from quarterback Cory
Paus, who threw for 216 yards and two touchdowns,
and wide receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, who caught six
passes for 106 yards and two scores.
1 lowever, it was the play of UCLA's aggressive de
fense that was most noticeable in the Bruins' sound
victory. In addition, the loss drops the Beavers from
the national title race and forces them now to fight for
any bowl game. The Bruins play the Ducks on Nov.
10 at the Rose Bowl, a match-up that will have a great
impact on both the national and Pac-10 race.
UCLA's next game is against Pac-10 rival Wash
ington (3-0, 1-0). The I 1 th-ranked Huskies played
a California team (0-4, 0-2) that is having one of its
worst seasons in recent memory. On the other

hand, Washington has had .i sin (essful early season
behind first year starter C.ody Pickett despite the
graduation of quarterback Marques I uiasosopo.
Nevertheless, the team was shocked by the Bears'
first-half offensive outburst on Saturday .is quarter
back Kyle Boiler threw three touchdowns to give
the Bears a 21-10 lead.
In (lit' second half, the I luskies regrouped as Pick
ett led the team to a 31-21 lead. California scored
again, but was unable to get into the end /one on
their last possession and lost the game, 38-21. I he
loss was the Bears' 19th straight to Washington, giv
ing the team a 0-4 record for the first time sin< e 1980.
While Boiler ended the game with 205 yards and
a career best four touchdowns, the (California defense
was unable to hold on to the team's lead, plat ing the
Bears in the cellar of the Pac-10. ()n the other hand,
Washington's win is their eighth straight conference
victory as they prepare to fiice the Bruins on ()< I. 13.

After two weeks of play, the Pacific 10 Conference
continues to be top-heavy as live teams, including
Stanford (3-0, 2-0 Pat-10), remain undefeated. The
conference has six teams in contention fora bowl
game as league play continued into its second week
without any major upsets.
Seventh-ranked Oregon (4-0, 1-0) continued its
winning wavs with a 38-21 victory over independent
Utah State (0-4). 1 he Ducks were led by Heisman
Trophy-candidate |oey Harrington, who completed
17 of 24 attempts for 261 yards and two touchdowns.
Harrington also scrambled into the end zone fora
touchdown in the second quarter.
Despite the victory, ()regon did not dominate the
Aggies as many people had expected. Oregon only
led by three points, 24-21, at the end of the third
quarter. 1 larrington then took control of the fourth
quarter, responding to the team's meager three
point advantage by engineering an 80-yard scoring
drive. I lie Ducks were also helped by running back
Maurice Morris, who ran for 175 yards and a touch
down on 22 carries.
Oregon's inability to dominate the Aggies has al
lowed UCLA to gain ground in the polls. The No. 9
Bruins (4-0,1-0) dominated Oregon State (1-2, 0-1),
causing the Beavers to drop out of the national top
25. The Bruins played an amazing all-around game,
gaining 496 yards on offense while holding the
Beavers to 220 yards on offense.
I he Beavers have had UCLA's number the past
two years, scoring 99 points in the two contests. Fi
nally, under new defensive head coach I'hil Snow,
the Bruins were able to stop the Beavers' offense, tak
ing a 17-0 lead into halftime.
The Bruins were led by the other I leisman candi
date in the Pac-10, running back Deshaun Foster.
Foster rushed for 147 yards and three touchdowns
on 31 carries. He is currently leading the Pac-10 with
502 yards in the team's four games, making him the
nation's ninth leading rusher.
The preseason favorite for the nation's best run
ning back was Oregon State's Ken Simonton, who
rushed fora career low 26 yards against the Bruins. Si
monton has been shut down this year, rushing for only
237 yards, allowing Foster to step into the limelight.
UCLA also saw strong play from quarterback Cory
Paus, who threw for 216 yards and two touchdowns,
and wide receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, who caught six
passes for 106 yards and two scores.
1 lowever, it was the play of UCLA's aggressive de
fense that was most noticeable in the Bruins' sound
victory. In addition, the loss drops the Beavers from
the national title race and forces them now to fight for
any bowl game. The Bruins play the Ducks on Nov.
10 at the Rose Bowl, a match-up that will have a great
impact on both the national and Pac-10 race.
UCLA's next game is against Pac-10 rival Wash
ington (3-0, 1-0). The I 1 th-ranked Huskies played
a California team (0-4, 0-2) that is having one of its
worst seasons in recent memory. On the other

hand, Washington has had .i sin (essful early season
behind first year starter C.ody Pickett despite the
graduation of quarterback Marques I uiasosopo.
Nevertheless, the team was shocked by the Bears'
first-half offensive outburst on Saturday .is quarter
back Kyle Boiler threw three touchdowns to give
the Bears a 21-10 lead.
In (lit' second half, the I luskies regrouped as Pick
ett led the team to a 31-21 lead. California scored
again, but was unable to get into the end /one on
their last possession and lost the game, 38-21. I he
loss was the Bears' 19th straight to Washington, giv
ing the team a 0-4 record for the first time sin< e 1980.
