While last weekend most Stanford students were
still pondei ing whit h classes to take, the men's water
I >< >I( > team aced its first real test for the season.
I lie top-ranked and unbeaten Cardinal (4-0, 2-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) downed No. 2
Southern California and No. 'i I CLA last Saturday
and Sunday in the opponents' home pools. The two
vic tories came by convincing margins — 10-5 against
tlu- I rojans and 1 ()-<> against the Bruins, the two-time
defending N( lAA champions.
After the scheduled game against UC-San Diego
on Friday was cancelled due to the Tritons' delayed
flight, Stanford's successful weekend run began with
a league game against USC. The Cardinal jumped
out to a <|iiic k 2-0 lead, fhe opening goal was scored
b\ redshirt freshman and co-captain Tony Azevedo
on a cross pass from junior Jeff Nesmith. Junior Brian
Darrow then increased Stanford's lead to put the Car
dinal up by two.
IJS( 1 c ill the gap to one with a goal on an extra man
situation in the first quarter. But while the talented
(Cardinal squad exploded with eight more goals dur
ing the second and third quarters, USC- could only
manage two. Nesmith and Darrow scored another
goal each, while Azevedo added two more to his tally,
junior All-American Peter Mucinut contributed two
as well, while senior co-captain I'asi Dutton tallied one
from an outside shot.
"We just blitzed them!" head coach Dante Detta
manti said. "Our 6-0 scoring spree was really unusu
al when playing against the No. 2 team in the country.
We had thought it was going to be a very c lose game."
With five minutes left of the fourth quarter, Detta

nianti gave his starters a chance to rest by substituting
them with his second team. USC came back to de
crease Stanford's lead to 10-5.
After a brief rest, Stanford faced the Bruins on
Sunday. UCLA jumped to an early 1-0 lead, but the
Cardinal came back immediately and scored three
goals in a row. Two of them were tallied by Azeve
do in an extra-man situation. Senior Todd Snider
scored one on a fast break as well. Then, with just
one second left of the first quarter, UCLA got a shot
to decrease Stanford's lead to 3-2.
In a manner similar to its game against I!SC, the
Cardinal defense then took over and shut the Bruins
out for the next two quarters, increasing the lead
from 3-2 to 8-3. UCIA was able to store only a single
goal at the end of the third period.
In the last quarter, senior Onno Koelman capital
ized on a pass from I ludnut. The Bruins came back
by a goal, then Harrow took advantage of an extra
man situation to make the gap 10-5.
UCLA's last goal came at the very end of the
game, when Dettamanti had once again replaced his
starters, giving his second team a chance to gain
valuable experience. Seven different players capital
ized on shots tor the Cardinal. Three goals belonged
to Azevedo, two to Koelman and one each to Snider,
Hudnut, Nesmith, Harrow and Dutton.
The Cardinal's winning formula included not only
excellent team offense, but strong team defense as well.
Junior Ail-American goalkeeper Nick Ellis collected
eight saves against USC. Stanford was able to shut
down die Trojans' two leading scorers — hole man
Predrag Damjanov was held to one go.il only, while
Ivan Babic was completely prevented from scoring.
\gaiiist the Bruins, hllis collected a
season-high 12 saves, outmatching
ICLVs First-'l'eam All-American
from last season Brandon Brooks,
who only tallied si\ saves.
"We plaved a phenomenal de
lense and completely nullified
their oHense," Nesmith said.
I he Cardinal showed an im
proved man-down defense to
complement its excellent front
core defense. I'SC was only able to
score on two of seven extra-man
opportunities, while I ( L\ con
verted three ol six man-up situa
tions into goals, two of which came
in the last quarter. I lie- ('.ardinal s
last-break defense showed im
pressive skill as well — neither op
ponent was able to score a goal on
a counterattack.
According to Dettamanti, this
season s successful performance
can be attributed to an improved
offense. Past Cardinal NCAA
c hampionship teams used a simi
lar tactic to the one the current
team displayed last weekend.
"In the p.ist, we would blast the
game open and then hold the
other team scoreless," Dettamanti
said. "Last weekend, it was really
hard to slop us. | I he opponents]
would trv to concentrate on de
fending Azeveclo, and then some
bod v else would score. I'm really
pleased with our ollense — last
season that was our weakness."
I lie story ol both games was
Stanford's scoring spurts in the
second and third quarters and the
lact th.it it held its opponents
scoreless during those.
"It was our ( bailee to prove
ourselves against these two power
houses." Nesmith said. "We
showed them how serious and
lired-up we are this season. I hey
got our entire package."
"We were using last weekend
as a test to see how good we are,"
Dettamanti said. "1 think we
found out."
