However, in San Jose, Oakland, San

I he range of options and costs de
pends on the different taxes and li

II imtii said that because tlie I nivci si

in the form of lowei basic cable rates.
Bill despite the better rates, several
students still find fault with flexibility in
service packages. For example, the I Di
versity does not allow students to set up
satellite dishes for television service.
"Students will say '1 just want to put a
little dish on my roof or my balcony',

I riinm said. Hut | our financial model
requires that we have as many sub
scribers as possible, and there are also a
series of safety and aesthetic s issues."
Students who are hard-pressed to
find discounted cable service can at
tempt to persuade all the residents in
their dorms to pitch in for the spec ial
bulk subsc riptionship. I his package
provides a 25-perccut disc ounl and in
cludes basic c able service for every
room and lounge within the residence.
Sigma (In is (in rently signed up for
the bulk deal, but I riinm s.ud more
houses might opt Ibi the same package
