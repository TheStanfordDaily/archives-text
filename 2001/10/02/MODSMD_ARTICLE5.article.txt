### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Students who last year launc lied
Bookshare, an online exchange
system that provides an alternatiye
to buying hooks at the Bookstore,
have added a Movieshare sen ice to
allow students to exchange videos
and DVDs.
Bookshare's creators, seniors
Nikliil Bhatla and I unlin ()u, are
being joined by senior David S.ili
n,is. who gave the two the idea to ex
pand from books to movies.
I he students said the idea of
both Bookshare and Movieshare
is simple and modeled after the
success of Napster: shai ing saves
money.
" 1 Unlit) and I were sitting in out
room, stating at our full book
shelves Â«iiid feeling depressed over
the amount of money we had spent
on textbooks for one quarter."
Bhatla said. " I heonK word I could
think of was 'waste.' "
Ou agreed. "!t was a total
waste," he said. "If you just think
about it. someone out there has
the books you want, and they're
just sitting on a shell."
According to Bhatla, the stu
dents have also updated the intei -
face and features of Bookshare
from last year.
