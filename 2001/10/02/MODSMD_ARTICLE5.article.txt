Bookshare, an online exchange
system that provides an alternatiye
to buying hooks at the Bookstore,
have added a Movieshare sen ice to
allow students to exchange videos
and DVDs.
Bookshare's creators, seniors
Nikliil Bhatla and I unlin ()u, are
being joined by senior David S.ili
n,is. who gave the two the idea to ex
pand from books to movies.
I he students said the idea of
both Bookshare and Movieshare
is simple and modeled after the
success of Napster: shai ing saves
money.
" 1 Unlit) and I were sitting in out
room, stating at our full book
shelves «iiid feeling depressed over
the amount of money we had spent
on textbooks for one quarter."
Bhatla said. " I heonK word I could
think of was 'waste.' "
Ou agreed. "!t was a total
waste," he said. "If you just think
about it. someone out there has
the books you want, and they're
just sitting on a shell."
According to Bhatla, the stu
dents have also updated the intei -
face and features of Bookshare
from last year.

Students who last year launc lied
Bookshare, an online exchange
system that provides an alternatiye
to buying hooks at the Bookstore,
have added a Movieshare sen ice to
allow students to exchange videos
and DVDs.
Bookshare's creators, seniors
Nikliil Bhatla and I unlin ()u, are
being joined by senior David S.ili
n,is. who gave the two the idea to ex
pand from books to movies.
I he students said the idea of
both Bookshare and Movieshare
is simple and modeled after the
success of Napster: shai ing saves
money.
" 1 Unlit) and I were sitting in out
room, stating at our full book
shelves «iiid feeling depressed over
the amount of money we had spent
on textbooks for one quarter."
Bhatla said. " I heonK word I could
think of was 'waste.' "
Ou agreed. "!t was a total
waste," he said. "If you just think
about it. someone out there has
the books you want, and they're
just sitting on a shell."
According to Bhatla, the stu
dents have also updated the intei -
face and features of Bookshare
from last year.
