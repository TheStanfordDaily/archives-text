( hi Iheta Chi, as one of only two undeigrad
uate houses not owned by Stanford, oilers a
unique residential opportunity lor students. Its
residents part ic ipate in all aspects ol house main
tenance; in exchange, they receive valuable
skills, the enriching opportunity ol living in a di
verse, socially conscious community and a sig
nificantly lediu ed room and hoard bill.
I he property, located at the intersection ol
Alvarado Road and (lampus Drive, belongs to
Stanlord. lis lease now belongs to the alumni
association ol the national I beta ( hi fraternity.
While acknowledging its unique environ
ment loi dialogue and s< k ial action, the Res l\d
ollice has expressed concern about health and
saletv issues. In ,i recent I)aily at ti» Ic. Res Kd I)i
-rec toi Jane ( amarillo said that "the Inivcrsitv
maintains the right to withdraw the lease.
Spec ilicalh. Res kcl has questioned the house
maintenance workload lor residents, which in
cludes cookinii. cleanmu and other house

chores. (lamarillo has s«ii< 1 that "this is not a very
good experience lor the students who are not
expecting this kind of liability, hut rather expect
to l)c lull-time students."
While the thought ol students Ix'ing loreed to
take on unwanted, non-academic and time-con
suming work is worrisome, students at Chi
1 beta ( hi are well aware ol what to expect he
lore drawing into the house.
In the weeks leading up to the I)raw, prospec
tive residents must perlbrin house maintenance
tasks in order t<> he eligible lot co-op housing.
Several resident-led guided tours ol Chi I beta
( hi include dear details ol the workload expect
ed of residents.
Many Chi l hcta Chi residents have vocally
supported the manner in which the house is run,
citing monetary s.i\ ingsand intra-housc unit\ as
the fruits of their efforts.
Altera mid-September Work Week consisting
of cleaninir. mowimr. huildinir and general re

furbishing, (hi Theta (ihi residents expressed a
degree of unity and familiarity that is foreign to
most Row houses.
I he maintenance projects arc not necessarily
obligations lor the residents ol Chi l'heta Chi;
when the students lecl the need lor a project that
they themselves have neither the time nor the
expertise to take on, they contract the work to
outside lalx>rers.
Ib ensure that the opportunities allbrdcd by
('.hi l'heta (Ihi —to learn new and practical skills,
to work c losely with housemates and to engage in
meaningful discourse and social activism — re
main available, the University and (.hi l'heta Chi
must further develop their cooperative relation
ship. For its part, (llii 'l'heta ('hi must work with
the Univcrsitv to guarantee safety standards. The
I niversitv must then respect the autonomy of the
house residents, whoc hoose to live in a sometimes
demanding environment in exchange for finan
cial savings and a novel experience.
