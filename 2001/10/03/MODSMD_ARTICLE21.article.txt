Ethics and Embryonic Stem Cell Research:
An Interview with Dr. Irv Weissman
Irv Weissman is the Karel and A vice
Beekhuis I'rolessor of (.ancei Biology, (iell
.ind Developmental Biology in the Pathology
Department .it Stan lord I niversity Medical
(lenter. I lie researc li conduc ted in Ins labo
ratory includes the identification and isola
tion of blood-forming stem cells in mice.
Stem cells are cells t hat are capable ol de
veloping into a variety ol different ( ell t\ pes;
einbrvonu stem <ells give rise to all of the
(••lis in the body. Dr. W'eissnian's research
has involved using mouse embryonic stem
(ells to look at how blood-forming stem cells
develop. I his researc li has possible applica
tions for the treatment of leukemia.
Q: How does your own research lead into
the ethical debate about embryonic stem
cell research?
A: Why would we w ant to do it with human
embryos il we (,m do so niiuli with |mouse
embryos]? Because translating major discov
eries that we've made in the past with the
mouse, whethei it's isolating .1 stem cell or
( loning a gene, t.ike .1 minimum of three
years, maybe up to seven years. I hose dis
coveries might be meaningful loi the lives ol
patients. It would be morally unacceptable to
impose .111 artificial thrce-to-seven \e.ll win
dow iu w lik li .ill those people will die tli.it
you could have tieated.
So here we are, we have the debate. We
have a level ol moral ac( eptahilitv. Is a blas
tocyst ,1 person? And the otliei level, if I
don't allow tins research, surelv I will dela\
progress to treat disease ol alread\ living
hoi 11 human beings. I hat's m\ frame of the
ethical debate. Once you enter into this de

bate, von are either for one or the other.
And eithei one lesults iu the loss ol what
some people c all a form of life. On the one
hand, the preimplantatiou blastocyst, [and]
on the other hand, living human beings and
lots ol t hem.
So nn personal opinion is that I never be
lieved for .111 instant that a blastocyst was a
human being. So for me there's no question,
but I live ii! a soc ietv, and this society has a
lot ol people who have other beliefs. No s( 1-
entist on his or her own should be able to
make ethic al decisions that are in contradic
tion to the ethic s of others. I hat lias to he
put into some sort ol forum for debate. And
it better be a fair forum, not just a political
election ola president whete even the elec
tion is iu question.
How you would suggest such a forum
be carried out?
A: Well, it's being clone in (longi ess; that's
pretty good. Not good enough, because
there's 110 wa\ that congresspeople and theii
st.ill will have the knowledge ol all the really
serious issues in bionicdic al ethic sand the re
lated sc ienc e to make an inloi ined dec ision.
So we want a group that can make an in
formed dcc isiou. In the past, the president 01
|National Institutes ol 11ca11111 or the ( on
gress has appointed a committee to deliber
ate on the subject and then come I>.k k with
recommendations, and then thc\ go in
through the legislative process 01 whatever. I
think it needs to be clone 111 a wa\ ili.it one's
own partisan bias or one's own religious In.is
doesn't predetermine the outcome.
But by saying that committee mem
bers must go in ignoring their religious and
political knowledge is not a realistic repre
sentation of the way American people think
and feel.
A: I rue, but you know we ti ust .1 lot to the
abilit\ ol ordinary people to learn and come
to .1 decision. Everv trial In jury cssentialh
takes people randomly from the community
to make a very important decision. I hey
know that it's their job to do that and they
have nothing else that they're allowed to do

whili* they're doing 11uit 1 think that we can
have and should have an expert panel that
has been chosen so that all the biases are
there. I think eventually you < ould use a jurv
and come up with the same answer. Sou
would present the case. Von would present it
li.is hard .is vou can, have it in an advocacy
setting s<> that the knowledge would be chal
lenged .it every step of the way.
Now the solution that (ieorge Hush gave
by executive order — |he] said that he
wasn't going to re-look at am <>l the embry
onic stein t ell lines already available by Vug.
9, 2001, [to] be eligible (or research under
federal funding, lie did not step m to s.tv
whethet or not you (<>uld do embryonic
stem cell research in .t private or commer
cial setting. Hut if we as a nation are going to
move forward on this, it has to be the best
and brightest people, and tlie\ don't exist in
the companies. I hc\ e\isi in univeisiiies
.iikl similar institutions. ( I licse institutions,
even private ones like Si an foul, re( cive fed
eral reseatt li funding.) I hat's not Io say that
people .it companies aren't bright, it's jusi to
sa\ that there aren't ver\ many people at
(oinpanics that do discovcr\ and researc li. I
(ould count on both hands the number of
people in private companies t hat are doing
i cat human emhrvoni< rcscaich. I bet once
it's available in universit\ settings, there will
be thousands working bee ause ii so poten
tially fruitful in terms of learning how
things develop in liiiinans. I lie (>1 lines
published by tlie \ 111 are not enough to ex
plore all of the researc li possibilities.
Q: Do you feel that Jim Clark's suspen
sion of his donation to Stanford University
was an effective way of protesting Bush's
decision?
A: I he question is if u mattcis to the na
tion that hinds were suspended toi a bio
medical science and engineering ccntei at
Stanford. 1 just talked to a (Congressional
aide foi a Republic an congressman who said
lie doesn't care. |im (.lark is a sin at t man who
has in the past demonstrated Ins political
know ledge. So we'll see.

Q: Do you feel that Jim Clark's suspen
sion of his donation to Stanford University
was an effective way of protesting Bush's
decision?
A: I he question is if u mattcis to the na
tion that hinds were suspended toi a bio
medical science and engineering ccntei at
Stanford. 1 just talked to a (Congressional
aide foi a Republic an congressman who said
lie doesn't care. |im (.lark is a sin at t man who

Ethics and Embryonic Stem Cell Research:
An Interview with Dr. Irv Weissman
Irv Weissman is the Karel and A vice
Beekhuis I'rolessor of (.ancei Biology, (iell
.ind Developmental Biology in the Pathology
Department .it Stan lord I niversity Medical
(lenter. I lie researc li conduc ted in Ins labo
ratory includes the identification and isola
tion of blood-forming stem cells in mice.
Stem cells are cells t hat are capable ol de
veloping into a variety ol different ( ell t\ pes;
einbrvonu stem <ells give rise to all of the
(••lis in the body. Dr. W'eissnian's research
has involved using mouse embryonic stem
(ells to look at how blood-forming stem cells
develop. I his researc li has possible applica
tions for the treatment of leukemia.
Q: How does your own research lead into
the ethical debate about embryonic stem
cell research?
A: Why would we w ant to do it with human
embryos il we (,m do so niiuli with |mouse
embryos]? Because translating major discov
eries that we've made in the past with the
mouse, whethei it's isolating .1 stem cell or
( loning a gene, t.ike .1 minimum of three
years, maybe up to seven years. I hose dis
coveries might be meaningful loi the lives ol
patients. It would be morally unacceptable to
impose .111 artificial thrce-to-seven \e.ll win
dow iu w lik li .ill those people will die tli.it
you could have tieated.
So here we are, we have the debate. We
have a level ol moral ac( eptahilitv. Is a blas
tocyst ,1 person? And the otliei level, if I
don't allow tins research, surelv I will dela\
progress to treat disease ol alread\ living
hoi 11 human beings. I hat's m\ frame of the
ethical debate. Once you enter into this de

bate, von are either for one or the other.
And eithei one lesults iu the loss ol what
some people c all a form of life. On the one
hand, the preimplantatiou blastocyst, [and]
on the other hand, living human beings and
lots ol t hem.
So nn personal opinion is that I never be
lieved for .111 instant that a blastocyst was a
human being. So for me there's no question,
but I live ii! a soc ietv, and this society has a
lot ol people who have other beliefs. No s( 1-
entist on his or her own should be able to
make ethic al decisions that are in contradic
tion to the ethic s of others. I hat lias to he
put into some sort ol forum for debate. And
it better be a fair forum, not just a political
election ola president whete even the elec
tion is iu question.
How you would suggest such a forum
be carried out?
A: Well, it's being clone in (longi ess; that's
pretty good. Not good enough, because
there's 110 wa\ that congresspeople and theii
st.ill will have the knowledge ol all the really
serious issues in bionicdic al ethic sand the re
lated sc ienc e to make an inloi ined dec ision.
So we want a group that can make an in
formed dcc isiou. In the past, the president 01
|National Institutes ol 11ca11111 or the ( on
gress has appointed a committee to deliber
ate on the subject and then come I>.k k with
recommendations, and then thc\ go in
through the legislative process 01 whatever. I
think it needs to be clone 111 a wa\ ili.it one's
own partisan bias or one's own religious In.is
doesn't predetermine the outcome.
But by saying that committee mem
bers must go in ignoring their religious and
political knowledge is not a realistic repre
sentation of the way American people think
and feel.
A: I rue, but you know we ti ust .1 lot to the
abilit\ ol ordinary people to learn and come
to .1 decision. Everv trial In jury cssentialh
takes people randomly from the community
to make a very important decision. I hey
know that it's their job to do that and they
have nothing else that they're allowed to do

whili* they're doing 11uit 1 think that we can
have and should have an expert panel that
has been chosen so that all the biases are
there. I think eventually you < ould use a jurv
and come up with the same answer. Sou
would present the case. Von would present it
li.is hard .is vou can, have it in an advocacy
setting s<> that the knowledge would be chal
