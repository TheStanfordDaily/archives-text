Nerds wear glasses, the
stereotype goes. Well, accord

ing to a recent study conduct
ed in Singapore, the
sterotype is wrong. Singa
pore requires ;ill males to
serve in the armed forces so

the si/e of the sample is huge
and diverse. Scientists sampled

429 const 1 ipts and found that my
opia correlated with every form of ad

vancetl education. 1 hose who completed
priman or setondarv school had a higher

percentage ol nearsightedness than those
that did not. The difference in those who held
college degrees and those who did not was the
largest — 90 percent to 73 percent. So does
reading too much cause strain on the eves.-'
That still remains to he seen. Ac cording to the
researchers, evidence linking this phenome
non to myopia is meager, and the causes and

effects remain fu//y.
Ten thousand years ago, North America
was teeming with horses, camels, lions,
ground sloths and mammoths. 1 hen .ill sud

hunters, according to Paul McNeil, a geology
graduate student at the

University of
(lalgary in Alberta, (lanada. McNeil and
coworkers found fragments of spears near
hone heds in southern Albert a. According to
him, even simple subsistence hunting, sue h ;is

remc>\ing five percent of the pop
ulation every year, would have I
destroyed the animal popula

shows how much we
can affect the environ

intend to do so, ac
