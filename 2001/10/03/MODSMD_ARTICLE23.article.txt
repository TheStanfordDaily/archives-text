Sony recently unveiled its
DVD Walkman D-VMI, a unit
that allows users to listen to
music or watch movies refold
ed on conventional, writable
and re-writable (ID and DVD
discs. The detachable LCD
screen that comes with the unit
can also be connected to a tele
vision for viewing at home. Ihe
D-VMi weighs just over a
pound. Sony plans to release
the prodtu ion Nov. 21 in Japan
at the price of around I ()().()()()
yen ($849). Sale in North Amer
ica is scheduled lor the second
quarter of 2002.

New research suggests that
nicotine may not be completely
evil after all. A study at the Sum
lord Medical School showed
that nicotine stimulates tlie divi
sion of cells, promoting growth
of new blood vessels. Although
the effects have only been wit
nessed on lab mice, researchers
believe that nicotine could be
used to treat diseases where
blood How is impeded, such as
diabetes, as well as neurological
disorders like Parkinson's Dis
ease and Tonrette\s Syndrome.

The military's Warfighter-1
hyperspectral imaging system

can effectively see through cam
ouflage. In addition to mapping
objects in the colors visible to
the human eye, hyperspectral
cameras also detect 'infrared
portions ol the electromagnetic
spectrum and other invisible
light. The YVarfighter-1 also
provides t lues about the condi
tions ground troops are likely to
encounter, such as uneven ter
rain and muddy soil. Ihe new
imagery technique can Ik- used
for civilian applications, such as
detecting crop blights, mapping
property damage and identify
ing marijuana growers in re
mote areas.

It you're planning to take a
torn by submarine in the near
future, the U.S. Navy's Hard
suit 2000 diving suit may help
you breathe a little easier. De
signed to aid underwater rescue
operations, the suit is certified
to operate at a depth of 2,(KM)
feet, 800 feet lower than con
ventional models. Despite
weighing 1,700 pounds, a pair
of side-mounted Ministers al
lows the suit to maneuver deftly
in water. Among the features of
the suit are hand pods for
grasping tools and oil-filled
floating joints for greater limb
flexibility. A sonar device and a
video camera attached to the
helmet enable navigators
aboard ship to monitor the
diver's movements.
