dillerenl bases are present in DNA: ade

It was latei found that DNA in the
(ell produces RNA. and that UNA in
tin n translates into proteins. I he mes
senger RNA transfers the gene's in
structions, thus prescribing the cre
ation of proteins In ribosoines. Is is in
teresting to note that not all the genetic
code in D\ \ gets translated into pro

"A DNA init loarray can be used as a

I lie genes that hybridize the most
are the most active genes, and those
that hybridize the least are repressed
genes. Depending on the amount ol
hybridization, the genes are tinged
with a certain color, with more ex

shades, and more repressed genes ap
pearing in greener shades. I 'his helps

important lead is that gene-expression

Lion of the time.
"We use I)NA microarrays contain
ing tip to 30,000 different human genes
to survery the gene expression patterns
in thousands of samples of human cells
and tissues under diverse conditions/'
l'rof Brown said. " These studies are
providing detailed mole ular pictures of
the programmed responses of the
human genome to diverse physiological
and pathological conditions, and the\
are yielding c lues to the mechanisms l>\
which these processes are deranged in
cant er and other disease processes.
Cancer studies with DNA chips
An application of the DNA microar
rav method is to compare the genes in
health) versus cancerous breast tissue
and at various stages ofbreast cane er pro
gression. Mike VViglerand Larry Norton
of the (iold Spring Harbor laboratory
and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering C an
cer (-enter, respectively, are using DNA
c hip to hue>logy 112« »r this purpose.
I odd (loluh and II colleagues at
Harvard Medical School reported in
Science maga/inc about theit use of
DNA chips to distinguish between two
forms of leukemia. The cancers detit t
ed for this trial run were pre\iously dis
tinguish.tble using conventional nieth
< >ds, but tfiis trial was a valuable oppor
tune to test the accuracy of DNA mi
croarrax technology.
An article in Hie Scientist magazine re
ported I he results ol the leukemia studv.
"Applying a 0,817-gene c hip to 38
bone marrow samples, the investiga
tors identified .">() genes whose expres
sion most distinguished acute myeloid
leukemia from lymphohladt ic
leukemia," said the article. 34 samples
drawn from a wider range ol source's
were then analyzed. Kxpression pat
urns, deiei mined with 1 )NA < hips, ac
t uratelv predicted the type of leukemia
l<)i 290f the" .34 samples."
1 hese results were clinicalK signifi
cant because the two t\ pes of leukemia
require very distinct treatments. (loluh
and his colleagues are now employing
DNA chips to investigate c anc ers of the
brain, prostate and lung.
