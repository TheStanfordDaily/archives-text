" I he field is st 1 ong not only
if you base it 011 last year's per
formances, but on what other
teams are doing this year,"
Stanford coat h |eff Mitc hell
said. "Washington has been
looking good. < )regon and ()re
gon St.ite have been playing
strong and Washington Stale
won last week. I liese are some
\en good golf te.uns

score.
"| Mastalir] has had limited ex
posure," Mitchell said. "But lie's
had some strong rounds and shot
some low scores. We're hoping
| Mastalir and | some of the
younger kids are going to step up
and make a big difference."

"| 1 he I lusk\ Invitational] was
parti) diagnostic, he said. "It's a
yotingei leani because we gradu
ated lour seniors. I think we're
jllst going to take it one team at a
time."
Milt hell doesn't expect his
success in his lirst vear at Stan
lord to aflet t the second season.
"Oui sui(ess last year isn't
playing into what we're doing
this year, but our goals are at
tainable. We're looking to win
two tournaments and |to] a top
three finish in the Pat -10 Cham
pionships," he s.iml
I he road to Pat -10's will be
tough, however. I his vear, three
conference teams are already
ranked in the top 2f>: No. 2 Ari
zona, No. S Arizona State and
No. I 7 Southern ( alilornia, who
won tliet onfcrctue title last year.
In fact, nine ol the Pat-10 teams
were vote-getters in a recent na
tional coach's poll. I he only team
not receiving votes. Washington
State, has finished first and sec
ond in its past two tournaments.
