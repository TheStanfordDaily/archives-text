Suite Mil had |ordan has now
ollit talh announcetl Ins re
tui 11 to the N BA, I would just
like to tip my hat to the self
proclaimed King o! Sports and
thank him loi gracing us with his
presente \et again. I would like to
thank him for giving me the oppor
tunity to see him 1.111 miserabh 111 his
ill-advised comeback, which will

prove to he an absolutely riveting show, as the Wiz
ards w ill tail to win 45 games anil miss the playolls toi
a tilth straight season.
\ on see, I 'm not one of those people won ieil about
him tainting his legacy. I welcome this news with open
arms anil quiver with anticipation tot the first time
Allen Iverson jukes M| out of his new, but retro, Air
|ordans, 01 the liist time Vince Clatter sends .1 lero
c ions dunk ovei his flailing arms and through the

hoop. I can't wait to see how a man who describes
himself as "the most competitive man on the planet"
will respond to losing more games this season than he
has lost since Ins rookie year.
1 his will be the true test of just how great the myth
it |ordan reall\ is without his 1 ight-hand man, N< ottie
I'ippen, right behind him.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not too stubborn that I
can't admit that |ordan is ()\ lot the best players in
the history of the game. But, I tlo stress the impor
tance of the word "one" and urge even one to look
closely at the supporting t ast he had to work \n ith and
think of how he will now do, two vears removed from
the NBA, without anv of these men behind him.
I hroughout the Bulls' d\ nast\, I'ippen was a l iist
learn NBA player in his own right, who often drew
the toughest defensive assignment, while the team's


Mo< Levine
power forward position u.is con
sistently occupied by an all-slut
hangei who coin ktiled the hoards,
in the likes of (Diaries ()akley, I lo
race(>rant and Dennis Rodman.
Yon can't forget that in 1993-
94, the yeat after M|'s first re
tirement, I'ippen led basically
the same Hulls' team, sans
Mi(hael, one <|iiestionable lonl

I'm not ti ving to sa\ thai (lie

that he had some damn good play
ers In Ins side, gn\s tli.it \vill make
his new VVi/ard teammates look
like an intramural st|uatl. I here
will be just a lit I lethange from pre-'
vious years.
I Ins season, the role of Scot lie
I'ippen will be pla\ed I >\ Richard
Hamilton, while the world
renowned jahidi While is stepping
in for Dennis Rodman. As foi Jor
dan's enforcer in the paint, the
Wi/ards are suiting up \o. I draft
pick Kwame Prown, who reallv
should be wrapping up Freshman
()rientalion in college as we speak.
In many wavs, I at liudlv (in a
non-sai< astit tone) applaud |oi
dan for coin ing bat k this season, in
what is definitely the bravest move
of his life, putting his name and
legacy on the line. In m\ opinion,
Jordan has nevei laced stit li a
i hallenge as what lies ahead ol him
this season, and I respect him foi

having the 'tajones' to take such a
risk. I jnst think lie's going to tail
Fora basis ol comparison, I
would like to point out last season's
Detroit Pistons, led l>\ swingman
and fellow I \C. alum |err\ Stat k
house, who was the league's sec
ond most prolilit scorei at 29.8
points per game. I he Pistons,
whose starting line-up also iiu hid
ed the league's second-best re-
Ifounclei iu Ben Wallace and
proven veterans in Joe Smith,
(iorliss W illiamson and (lliutky
Atkins, went a whopping 32-. r >o,
finishing nine games out ol the
eighth and final plavoll spot.
Willi |ordan at the helm, the
Wizards — who went 19-f>3 last
year — should resemble this Pis
ton team, and that is il all goes
well. At 38yeais<>ld. M| will be
no more ola dangerous scorer
than the 2(>-veai old Sta< kliouse
(Id be surj)i ised il lie malt bed
Slat khouse's 29 points pei game),
and wht) else is there to pit k up
tlie slat k?
Rit hai(l I i,million and (.01111-
ney Alexander are both a veai or
two away Iroin filling that role,
while kwame Prown isa projet t in
the earh stages of development
flic Wizards have no offensive op
lions down low and no presente
under l lie hoards a la Pen W'allat e.
Washington did make a iik <• move
in the oil-season, stealing free
agent point guard luonn I,ue
from the l.akcis. llowe\er, the
speedy 1 .lie is nit>re of a role plavei
than a pla\ inakei himself.
As Detroit showed last season,
it's iii( reasingh hard to win in the
N PA with on Is one capable scorer,
and the Wizards are delinitch

going to learn that lesson in the
coming months. Without .1 doubt,
the team will l>e better than last
seas(in, in which lliev had no < apa

we will set-.
In my humble opinion, the
Wizards w ill hover around the 40-
wi 11 mark, finishing just behind
the Pacers, (Celtics and Nets as the
lOth-best team in the I*astern
(lonference. In iiu t, assuming the
team remains basically the same
.is it stands today, I will guarantee
111 writing that the Wizards do not
m.ike the playoffs, and I will
