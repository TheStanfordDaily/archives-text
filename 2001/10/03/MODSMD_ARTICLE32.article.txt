# Lee anchors Stanford senior defense

### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
Molding I ailbat k U. to 2<S
rushing yards is an ama/ing de
fensive fc.it. Slanlord did just thai
oil Saturda\ .ig.tinst Southern
California, and it was names like
Cloy Wirt* and Marcus Hoover
thai repeatedly echoed from the
Memorial Coliseum's public ad
dress svsteni whenever tackle
was made.
Wire and Hoover's contribu
tions have been instrumental in
limning the Cardinal's rush de
fense, currenth No. 2 in the Pa
cific len Conference. Yet every
time No. 22 Stanford smothers a
running back behind the line ot
scrimmage, another Cardinal
plaver must be doing the grunt
work, grinding it out with offen
sive lineman in the trenches.
More often than not, that player
is senior Austin Lee.
"Most of ni) job at strong side
defensive end is occupying the
lineman." Lee said. "So it I'm get
ling double-teamed by somebody
and they run the ball to my side
and we still tackle them fora short
gain, then I did a good job."
After Stanford lost last sea
son's top two pass rushers and
sack leaders, Willie Howard and
Riall |ohnson, to the NI L draft,
many expected a drop-off in the
Cardinal's run defense and pass
rush. Yet 200 Is defensive line
lias been anything but a disap
pointment, ;is Stanford lias con
tinuously keyed on opposing
running backs and shut them
down effectively.
No. 94 should be a familiar
sight in the Cardinal defensive
line, as Lee started 1 I games be
fore this season. But with the
graduation of Howard, Lee has
moved into the role of defensive
veteran and has secured a start
ing spot in Stanford's all-senior
defense.

"Willi Marcus Hoover and
Austin, we have two experienced
defensive ends who have played
a lot of football the past three
years." defensive line coach Phil
Zacharias said. "He's a senior
who has been there, had success,
is a leader and knows what we ex
pect from him both on and off
the field."
Meeting I .ee, it's hard to tell he
was Idaho's state player of the
year, as well as a Parade and Su
perprep All-American. I'lie soft
spoken Post Falls, Idaho native
cites his state shotput champi
onship as his greatest athletic ac
complishment, though his partic
ipation in the 2000 Rose Bowl

ranks right up there.
Heavily recruited out of high
school, Lee's attendance at Stan
ford was hardly a foregone ton
elusion. He used all his recruit
ing trips, visiting Ohio State,
I S(I CL\ and (Colorado, but it
was the unity of the Cardinal
teammates that brought him to
the Farm.
"Stanford was the best plate
for me, the best environment,"
Lee said. "All the guys on the
team get along very well. I here's
nt) racial division among the
players and they're all really
good guys."
Lee takes his role as a team
leader seriously, though lie admits

with .1 smirk tli.it lie lias not always
Ixrn "tin' Ix'st practice player."
" I here's a lot ol guys on the
team that are really vocal in terms
ol cut < titrating people,' I ec said.
"I try to lead more by exmple. I
tr\ to prat tit c hard."
rhough lie's by no means a
trash-talker. Lee is not afraid to
gel inside opponent's heads with
a lew well-timed words.
"I'm not much ola trash talk
er. I would waste too ninth ener
gy and get tu ed, I .ec said. "Most
ol the trash-talking goes on with
the ret civet s. defensive b.u ks and
running hat ks. The big fat guys
