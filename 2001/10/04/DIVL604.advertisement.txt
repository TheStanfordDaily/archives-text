Background
As mans of you know, the Islamic Society of Stanford has received a number of hate emails (originating from out
side the campus community) during the past few weeks. However, we have received many more emails of under
standing and encouragement from our classmates, professors, and administrators. We sincerely thank the
university community for its tremendous outpouring of support during this difficult time. It is our hope that the
Stanford community will be a catalyst in helping all Americans understand the difference between vile terrorists
and their peaceful American Muslim neighbors. To increase the understanding of Islam on campus we invite the
entire Stanford community to attend our Friday October Stli worship service. The Muslim community at Stanford
will he honored by your presence.
