Student cable television options are decid

have three options, none of w hit h is well
suited to the average student's viewing
habits and wishes.

Stanford students are a particularly busy
group of people. Between our problem sets, pa
pers, extracurricular activities and runs to the
I )ish, we seldom find time to sit around watching

I he vast majority of Stanford stutlents. when
they tlo have time to sit down and watch the tulx\
are seeking programming which will remind
them that life exists outside of the Farm, lb that
end, it is fitting that channels such as (INN,
KSPN, M I V and the I listory Channel are pro
vitletl in our pat kage.

An associate director of technology and aca

ing Services recentlv t<>lt 1 the Daily that if it were
to offer a lt)wer-ct)st, limited opt it hi, it would have
to raise the 112 ull bask t able tier rate to make up the
revenue.
Fine.
While most of us have little or no time for tele
vision viewing during the day, there are some
television aficiandos in our midst who swear by
nightly episodes of (change of I lea it ant I Beverly

1 his tin) proportion of the Stanford popula
tion could pay more for the luxury of having 70

channels in their dorm rooms. A $10 increase in
the monthly fee for full cable service would make
the rate commensurate with that charged by local
off-campus providers.
A lower rate plan for the rest of the students
might actually increase overall revenue, as stu
dents who might not have otherwise purchased a
plan would then have a greater incentive to do so.

al)out die cliche of the "bubble."'l he term is used
to characterize geographic as well as intellectual
isolation from the outside world.
When forced to pay such exorbitant prices for
something as simple as a nighthly news broad
cast, students are denied an excellent opportuni
ty to escape that bubble.
