As Jews, we have heen here hclorc. A lull-scale as

We lieai in our shofiu the triumphant call ol
courage and resilience, hope and possibility. We best
repair the brokenness of the world in relationship
with each other — in friendships and in loving kin

Year, let us reach out to those who are suffering. I et

justice, voices lor measure, voices lor humanity .is we

And let us savor fully what is sweet: our coinmuni

our sac red time to declare our unwavering conviction
in the- ultimate goodness of humanity, the sanctity ol
