### REVEREND MAURICE CHARLES GUEST COLUMNIST 
M y dinner companions and I
were Mill reeling from the
new sol Sept. 1 1. While 11 \ ing
to navigate that niurkv space
between numbness and disbelief, we did
our best to make sense ol the images we
had seen.
"\ou know, whatever their political
motivations, whoevci did this nuist have
beendeeph religions.' I sighed. M\ words
were greeted with .i raised evebrow - not
the sort ol thing one would ex pet t to heai
from a pi iest. "You see, onh someone mo
tivated b\ misguided religions /eal, a beliel
that he was doing (iod's woi k and an ex
pected reward in the afterlife would em
bark on such .t carefullv ( rafted suicide
mission.
Raised evebrows gave way to nods of
cjniet agreement.
I'eople ol deep faith know well the
powei ol religious conviction. It (an moti
vate us to great ,i< is ol sell less (ou rage, ,h
we saw in the news images ol father
Judge, who lost his life caring foi others,
borne aloft l>\ the firefighters to a propel
burial. It can also incite violence. I his is ,i
hard truth. Bui the recurrent images of
tow ers falling to dust make I his truth hard
to denv.

By now , main have had the opportuni
t\ to read the instructions to the terrorists
that were found b\ the 1 81. I nfortunate
l\, m\ oi iginal suspicions wen* confii nied.
I he letters are replete with religious lan
guage. And although the references are
from a tradition diflerent from mv own,
the words ring oddly lamiliar: "l'ra\ the
morning praver in a group and ponder
the great rewards of th.it prayer."
1 heai mv spiritual director, shaking his
index linger, reminding me of mv priest l\
(11it\ to s.iy morning and evening prayers
on behalf of the (.hurch and the world:
"Smile in the face of hardship, voting man
... lorvou are headingtoward eternal par
adise."
1 hear Mother quoting the words ol
