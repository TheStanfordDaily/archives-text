11.mi I lanjoin came to tin- I .S. to
study Knglish at Hol\ \.lines College
in Oakland. But he never.mended am
classes — instead, authorities believe
he participated in (lie hijacking ot
American Airlines Might 77, which he
and his fellow terrorists crashed into
the Pentagon on Sept. I I.
Last week, Sen. Dianne Keinstein
(I)-('.;ili 1.) proposed .1 piece ol legist.l
- that would close the loophole
Hanjour used to remain in the I nit
ed States. Net Feinstein believes
doing so would re(|uire a six-month
freeze on the issuance of all visas fOl
foreign students, a proposition that
alarms mam in the Stanford commu
nity and elsewhere.
" The proposal is a cause for con
cern," said juniot Ratnesh llalakrish

nan, who coordinated this year's Inter
national New Student Orientation.
" lwcrvoiie is trying to cover all ol their
bases |in regard to homeland securit\ |,
and in the process ihe\'re perhaps
going a little overboard."
Problems with the student-visa
system
Currently, most foreigners who
enter the countn 011 student visas
need onl\ to be admitted to a college
and (It mi the State 1 )epartinent's noto
riousl) weak screening s\ stein. Once
thev enter the country, no one is re
quired to track their whereabouts.
Legislation passed I >\ Congress in
1 ( .K)() was intended to beef up the trat k
ing sNsieni foi international students,
but the new laws are not vet enforced
to am meaningful extent. Main, like
11.111 jour, nevei even matriculated but
instead remained 111 the I S with their
expired or invalid \ isas.
In addition lo imposing the six
nionih moratorium, leinstein's plan
1 .ills f<>l ovei $\V2 million in funding to
give the Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service the time and nione\ nec

essan to implement a comprehensive
tracking system.
Feinstein called the current stu
dent-visa system "one ol the most
unregulated and exploited visa
categories."
" I he Senator sees a big loophole in
out immigration law," s.iid Scott (ler
her, a spokesman for Feinstein's Wash
ington ollice. "She wants the INS to fix
the problem and to implement a trai k
ing system so we know which people
with student visas are in the countr\
and which aren't."
Concerns over Feinstein's plan
John Pearson, direi tor of the Bet h
tel Intelnational Center, said he fore
sees wide-ranging effects it Feinstein's
plan comes to fruition.
"II the moratorium was in place
dining summer, it would prevent up
to 800 new international students from
arriving at Stanford," Pearson s.iid
"(liven the strong support foi interna
tional students as an important aspei I
of education at Stanford and othei in
stitutions around the U.S., the ellects
would be severe in terms of teaching

and reseai (h."
(.erbci said hedidn't know w liether
Feinstein's plan included am sort of
compensation lor (ollegcs, who would
likely take a significant financial 11 it
110111 the lost tuition.
"I do know that the Senator has met
with a number ol universities, nu hid
ing the I nivcisit\ ol California, and
they've agreed to work togethei to
come up with a solution to the prob
lem." he said.
lialaki ishnan s.iid he doesn't see fe
instein's 11101 at< >1111111 as .in effective wa\
to keep terrorists out of the countra .
"| I he terrorists] are pretty re
sourceful," he s.iid. "I'm sure they <au
find alternative measures |to obtaining
a student \ isa]."
Privacy issues for international
students
Anothei concern Ibi international
students stems from reports that
some colleges have been providing
government investigators with confi
dential financial records m an cfioil


112
to find students who havelies to
ilu- terrorists. I lie Boston (llobe
repotted th.it several colleges
have given out this sort of infot
mation without informing the
students involved.
University (leneral (lounsel
Dehra /uinwalt said that Si.in
fold onl\ complies with such re
quests it they are ba< ked up h\ a
court otdei and appropi iate
dot umentation.
"I suall\ whoever requests ih.it
information informs the student."
s.iid /uinwalt. "If the\ request that
it not he disclosed to the student,
that's an issue that we have to deal
with on a case-bv-case basis." She
added that sm h instances are "ex
tremeh rare."

"All institutions 111 the I S. that
enroll internation.il students agree
to comply with (ei tain legal obliga
tions. " said l'carson. "One is to
make available to relevant federal
agencies immigration information
on students."
"But." he (ontimied. "it is onh
immigration information that we
are required to show — for exam
ple copies of immigration docu
ments issued to students."
/.uinwalt said she hopes that
the government respects the
needs of law-abiding students in
its attempt to tighten restrictions
on immigration.
"While we understand the
need to protet I national sec ui it\
and we're s\ nipat lift it to that,
hopefullv things c an be done in
a way that will not cause prob
lems for legitimate foreign stu
dents who need \isas to attend
Stanford."
