Rev. Stoit\ Mtf.ennan, Dean
of Religious Life, has seen many
instant es of puhlit teat lion to the
atiat k and support for the \ it lims.
"M\ expel lent e is that there
has been a tremendous outpour
ing ol concern on the Stanford
tampus. Witness more than 1,000

Rob Polheinus sees the apparent
lat k ol response among students
as a mixture of uncertainty and
an inabilit\ lo adet|uatel\ com

"Kverybody is worried, and
evervbod\ knows things may

how, so easv slogans and tom

ol w hat is t ailed 'dist ussion, it

dents as vou might expect," Pol
heinus saul

I'olhemus has observed that the
laculty, as well as the students, Ire
({uently do not express theii feel
ings, hut talk about issues related
to the events oi Sept I I.
"()lten the Angst is disguised ot
displaced into talk about things
like falling housing prices,
< hanged travel plans, the won ies
over a depressed slot k market,
the shrinking endowment 01
traumatic anxiety dreams inni
pulsively recited in dizzving de
tail." I'olheinus said.
Ile believes tlie I nivei sii\ s
faculty and students have dealt
well with the attacks, organizing
disc ussions that explore the
"great, complex problem ol the
real and potential savagei ) in hu
manity, inc hiding oui selves. - '
Students' thoughts about the
lac k of public response arc.' mixed.
While some see no general re
sponse 01 c hange in atmosphere,
11ic\ can point to specific exam
ples of reai lions to the attai ks.
Dorotln Louis, a sophomore
hum New York, leels that there is
no c hange in the I'livironment .it
Stanford, due to the elicit ol the
"Stanford bubble,'" but she has
seen small signs ol reaction to
Sept I I.
"Some people iu m\ cloi in
have been rcac ting to it, likc
hanging up flags in the windows."
she s.iid.
Another student, who asked to
lemain anonvmous, was din
certied about the stei eotvping she
has w itnesscd.
"What bothers me is that we've
gotten so caught up in the midst
ol being pad iotic that we also foi
get evervone here is Ainetican.
We turned against Middle East
ern people. In Fremont, I've
heard people sav racist slurs to In
