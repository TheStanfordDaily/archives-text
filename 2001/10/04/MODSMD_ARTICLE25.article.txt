in the lit st round to Indiana.
In the past the Cardinal has held a slight edge,

"San |t)se State is a very good team." said senioi
I ,ee Moi i ison. "F.verv time we play them it's a \ei x

Sail |osc Si.lie has liisioi i( .ill\ been.i tough mati h
Ibi 11 if (Cardinal — witness last season's game, when
the teams were (breed to end in a 1-1 draw aftei two
hard-fought overtimes ( ould not settle the gridkx k.
liu identallx. the ('.ardinal went into that matt h with
the Spartans taming the same (i-0 mark that the\
w ill hi ing into tonight's game.
l.ast year's Spartan team was dominant in the
regular season, as the) went 20-1-1. I'hev took an
earl\ how-out from the postseason, however, losing
in the lit st round to Indiana.
In the past the Cardinal has held a slight edge,
with a 1 5-1 I record against the Spai tans. I lowev
er, the st all's will he tipping slight 1\ in the (Cardinal s
faxor in this vear's matt h up, as ii will he plaved in
the friendlx confines ot New Malone\ Field. In fbui
seasons at the young fat ility. the squad has a
record tin Stanford's campus, including theii 9-2
mark last season.
"San |t)se State is a very good team." said senioi
I ,ee Moi i ison. "F.verv time we play them it's a \ei x
t lose and haul fought game. We've played them 11 it
last two times at t licit place and it will lie a huge ad
vantage to he ai home this time around. I lic\ arc
|iist 2") minutes axvax. w hit h makes ilus game alwa\ s
have a lot of bragging rights involved."
II the Spartans want those bragging lights,
though. tlic\ will need to lintl a wax to solve a xcrx
sting\ Stanford defense. In the squad's six games,
opponents have onl\ managed one goal against the
defensive unit. I his is in large part due to the plax of
jllllit>i goalkccpei Andrew I'crris, xvlio has 19 saves
l< »r a 0.19 goals against avci age.
I his string t>f shutouts max he hard to uphold
tonight, as the ( ardinal will face the Mountain I'a
< if it Sports Federation's leading scoret ibis vear in
senioi midfieldei Lars Lyssand. I his season he has
tallied eight goals in his squad's eight games.
" I he Stanford-San |osc State games have alxvax s
been prcttx t lt>se ami iliat tliex have been a xcrx dif-
lit nit opponent for our team the
last several years," said head
coat li Bret Simon.
" l lie feeling among out guvs
is that San |ose State has tradi
tionally been good, so I know
that we have a lot of respect for
them. I hey have a lot of skilled
players who are very talented
and dangerous. I bev also have
one of most skillful players in
Lars, who is very clever. We ex
pet t this to be .i tough game,"

Simon added.
Depth is another strength for
the Cardinal in this game. I Ins
earlv in the season, Simon has
been able to pla\ 28 of the 29-per
son rosier, including live fresh
men, which is a drastic change
Iroin lasi season, when <ml\ one
freshman saw pla\ ing lime.
I bis is the squad's first game
sine e its vie tories ovei Dartmouth
and Fresno Stale last weekend,
leading it to take the Nike Stan
lord Invitational tournament l.ist
weekend and moving it up t,o No.
2 in the NS( '.AA poll.
"We're not al the point as a
team where we're pnttinu in ( .)()

minutes of great soccer," said
Simon. "We're very good in seg
