# Ben Stiller has problem with 'Zoolander' director
## Actor discovers he can't work with himself on the set 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
Ben Suiter's "Zoolander" is a phenome
nally had movie. It lacks class, charisma and
charm. 1 he characters don't look like

«. itCrCrCrC.r —

they're having any tun. 1 lie jokes fall fl.it.
I lie timing is ofl I hated every single minute
of it.
I his is not a movie that should have been
made at all. It is slow and stupid and slow
and stupid. And ves, I .1111 repeating mvself.
But that is because I c annot begin to explain
how phenomenally bad "Xoolander" is.
I know what vou're thinking: I'm a movie
critic. It's m\ job to go and see phenomenal
ly bad movies. And it is my job to analv/e
them and to explain wli.it makes them so
phenomenally bad. But with "Zoolander"
I'm dumbstt uck. I his movie gives me noth
ing to analyze.
There are no performances, but simply
strange caricatures on the st reen. I he con
cept of the film originated from a skit per

formed by Stiller a few years ago .it <1 VIII
fashion awards show.
And there is no plot. In fact. I would not
Ik* surprised if a great deal of the scenes were
improvised by actors who did not know how
to improvise in the first place
The bulk of the blame, I suppose, should
lit- on Ben Stiller's shoulders, in lact. lit- is
not onl\ the star of the movie — but also
takes writing and directing credits. I his is
shameful.
1 am not a mean person. I'nder normal
circumstances, I consider Ben Stiller a
strong coniedi( actor, lie was wonderful
and warm in "Meet the Parents." one of the
Ik'sl films of the vear 2000. But in "Zoolan
der," one of the worst films of 2001, Ben
Stiller can't even be Ben Stiller.
He speaks in a monotone voice and
moves in rigid gestures. It's like Ben Stiller is
playing Adam Sandler plaving labio.
I he premise is simple. Stiller is Derek Zo
olander— the world's most famous super
model. lle has two problems: (I) lie is ,ifi ,ii<l
of being replaced b\ his nemesis. .1 younger
supermodel named Hansel (Owen Wilson);
and (2) he is secretly brainwashed by the
male modeling agencx (headed b\ W ill Fer
rel and Jerry Stiller) to kill the prime minis
ter of Malavsia so tli.it < liild labor (.111 still
flourish in third-world < 0111 it 1 ies. I his is be
cause, of course, the male modeling industn
relies on cheap labor to produt e new lines of
clothing.
Is this funnv ? Not one bit.

But the opening scenes, shot 111 .1 dark
room w itli a shadow\ figure bantling out as
sassination orders is too eerie to be consid
ei etl (omedv.
I lie strange thing is. the studio 1 ep< >1 ted
l\ deleted shots of the World I rade (lenter
from "Zoolander" so that audiences would
not be reminded of the terrorist attacks 011

Sept. 11. And vet, not one thought ih.it a cold
assassination attempt involving brainwash
ing would not be considered distasteful?
Mm I will not linget on this point am
longer. I do not object to "Zoolander" be
cause of the assassination story line— 1 ob
ject to it because it is not entertaining. Not
one bit.


Neither one of us will make a good movie ever again. Ever..
