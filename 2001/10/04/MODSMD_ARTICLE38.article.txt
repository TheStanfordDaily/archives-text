I lit- Verve Pipe's new release,
"Underneath," is truly .111 album
with heart.
With its l<>( us on love, the apth ti
lled album showeases the 11-year
old band's musical maturity though
its remarkable depth <»l leeling. 1 lie

Indeed. the II tracks on "I ndei -

Pipe once again managed to mix
musical si\les to create an uncleni

Hut what is so remai kable about

to vvh.it tan be considered pop

music, the album "I nderneath ' Nt 111
merits praise. According to drum
mer / songwriter Donnv Brown, the
band took .1 hammer and chisel to
these songs. . . and chipped away
until they were right. And right
these songs are. I he album's first
single "Never Let You Down" al

readv found success as it hit the air
wax es this summer. At alt by, joyful
tune about the courage behind giv
ing love a chance, the album's sec
ond 11 at k is certainly one ol its most
irresistible.
Anothei highlight of the album is
the melodic fourth track "Miles

tured relationship. I lie harmonic

demonstrates once again the band's

tainly will never let us down.
