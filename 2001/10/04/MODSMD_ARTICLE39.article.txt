I he painting features a
cartoonish sort ol charac
ter, K.lliot. wringing his
hands in front ola type
writer. I he I weaker album
seems to lollow the storv of
Elliot according to Vien
na's interpretation. But
since his conception of El
liot's story is buried in elec
tronic ambient abstraction,
the music leaves the audi

ente members completely
free to make up their own
stories.
In order to compliment
his electronii soundscapes,
Vrenna invited a host of
guest musicians, including
David Sylvian, Bu// Os
borne, Will Oltlh.un and
Craig Wedren. I liese per
formers atltl a perfect
human element to the
sound. He also provided
guest l\ lit ists with a con
cept of the story and let
them create their own
l\ rit s.

rhythmu qualities, which
do not rely too hcavilv on
(Irnin mac (lines. I nstead,

sounds, delaved to create a
swirling soundscape. Hie
music is frecl\ intertwined
with the rh\thm, and each

goes.
llv the time the song li.is

ended, (he emotional state
has returned to its origin
.iiul is poised to begin a new
phase of the journey in the
next song. While much of
Elliot's journey is pervaded
by darkness, there is a fun
damental optimism in the
nuisic. In the end, Elliot's
dysfunctional world hasn't
( hanged, but he seems to be
.it peace with it, and accepts
it in all ol its quirky mani
festations.
For fans of Nine Inch
Nails, I weaker is cei t.iinlx
.1 departure in sound .ind
mood, hut many familiar el
ements turn up on this
album. 11 the "industrial"
tag that is usually attached
to Nine liu li N.iils conjures
up images of some anti
quated factory where hulk
ing mat liinerv is obscured
by some sort of chemical
vapor, I weaker presents .1
microsized version ol this
world. You could imagine
Tweaker existing in some
inventor's laboratory,
where the machinery con
sists more ofgadgetrv than
artillery.
However, many ol the
1 In thins, sounds and even
melodic themes are remi
niscent of Nine Inch N.iils
and 111.iv appeal to those
lans. For fans of ambient
electronic music, the fusion
ol rock elements (most
prominent in the vocals
and guitars) helps to .idd .1
more human sound to the
robotic textures.


My name is Elliot. I like computers
