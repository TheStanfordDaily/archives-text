It is dillitult to fathom that I
was m eighth grade when I lirst
heard what is now a staple on
rock, radio — "Shine' by (Collet -
live Soul. Well, seven years and
live albums later we are now
graced with "7even Year Itch:

Collective Soul Greatest Hits
1994-2001". 1 he band, formed
in Stockbridge, Georgia In gui
tarist and vocalist Kd Roland,
now are the owners of eight
number one rock hits as well as
two gold >111(1 two platinum
RIAA certified albums.
However, this success did not

conic overnight. IWfore its 1994
breakout, the band endured al
most a dec ade ol trials and tribu
lations. Roland was raised in a
strict fainilv th.it denied him ac
cess to the radio.
Despite these restrictions, he
lelt to study guitar at the Berklee
College ol Mnsi< in Boston.
Mass. Roland soon ran out ol
money and had to return to
Stockbridge, where he got a job
at a local recording studio. It was
then he learned about produc
tion and formed ('.ollective Soul.
I lie band tried unsuccessfulh
for years to get signed onto a
major label and temporarih dis
banded in 1992, until radio sta

about "Shine."
