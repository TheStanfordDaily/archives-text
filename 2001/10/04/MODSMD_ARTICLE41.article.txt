# Bitch and Animal pay tribute to plastic penises

### MICHAEL BAER 
I Ik* press packet for duo Hitch (bass and
\<>( .ils) ,iikl Animal (pert ussion and backup)
seems to i in lit ate 11 it*\ re confrontational les
bian feminists, and that may be so. But they
don't make bad music either, for conven
tional music, however, one would have to
look elsewhere.
I heir sophomore album, "Fternalb
Hard." lias just been released on Ani
l)i Franco's Kightous Babe label. I he duo is
currenth on tour with l)iFranco, so one

might expect to find a bit in common will
the folk queen, filings start out with tlit

bluntlv titled
"Best (lock on

which sounds a
bit like the
Beastie Bows

pert ussion and
bass instead of men with guitars and sam
plers. In an ode to plastit penises, the\ sing,
"What can I sa\ I hc\ just can't stay awav
From the best cock On the block today It's
eternally hard." A Iresli track about the
\ 11 tues ol tlelat liable genitalia thus kit ks oil
this hour-long album on a promising note.
I nlot 11matelv. with their limited and iin
(onvcution.il instrumentation, Bitch and
Ani in. il have a (alieni) hard time living up to
theii promise. I be songs are entertaining
iildivitlualh. but the album as a whole, but
di ned with a stripped-down sound, seems
rathe! empty-sounding. Most tracks alici
the humorous opening are serious medita
tions on romantic sexual and woildh at
tat hmcnts as seen through the eyes ol these
two self-proclaimed gentler benders.
I oo often veering close to obvious refer
ences of musical feminism (riot girl bands
and other indie women, such as label mis
tress Ani I)iFranco), "Eternally I lard" seems
like an attempt to find the middle ground be
tween hero mimicry and experimentalism.
At their worst, Bitch and Animal sound
like beat poets on open mil night. Attempts
to be earnes — and there are a few — seem
forced, such as on the politically correct
"Pissed," which despairs: "Fast asleep in

racist I».it hs I It.ii keep
people powerless Pol-

luted .iikl poor
Scrubbed clean

this song, the
very bluntness
that served "Best

them b.K k

However, there
are plent\ ol examples ol
their best on the album as
well. I'hings seem to
work well when the\ use
humor, as in the title
ii.u k. instead ol drama.

For .ill its assets, though, "Kternally

Perhaps this is because the instrumentation
is so unconventional — the closest thing to
