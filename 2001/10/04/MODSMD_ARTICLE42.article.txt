|ay claims that he doesn't like sit

guitar. "W hat I realk want," he sa\s.
"is a loud hand, hut sometimes vou
i;ot to go it on your own."
II |ay's goal was a loud hand, he did

not succeed. Plaintive, solt and mel
low are the hest words to describe this
album.
I licit' are sonic edgiei elements to
be found in |a\ s mixes. I lie filial bal
lad. "A World Awa\ opens with the
sound ol children on a playground,
and almost all ol the songs have un
usual prodiu I ion elements.
Yet, lor all ol the electronic ele

impression that |a\ could walk out

he heard the lines, "I woke up this

Must have deserted me while I was

|av's arrangements have promise.
His sound is an amalgamation of
many groups, but the mixes give his
songs a personal

touch II he works
further on st 11 <1 it>

may develop a
