|>< > i T;i 111 difference between I lit* two
films: "Haiku I uniu'l" is. for almost
its entire length, in< redihlv, cata
silopliii.illv mind-dest loyingh tin
funny. I here are, it is true, one or
two mildly amusing jokes about
lawvers living in the Mission, and
the leading man is undeniably
lunnv-looking. hut lor most <>l the

movie, the audience is left in numb
contemplation of the script's banal
it\, waiting for the entertaining part
to start.
"Haiku funnel" may accurately
portrav the dullness ol the modern
American office, in the same way
that the gore-filled cautionary Dri
ver's fd film "Wood on the High
way" .u< urately portrays the results
ol careless driving, but that doesn't
mean anybody would voluntarily
c boose to watch either movie.
I he plot of "Haiku funnel' be
trays the film's origins .is a standup
comic monologue. Nothing ever re
all\ happens, none of the characters
have an\ identifiable motivations,
and much ol the dialogue seems
obligatory and dull; it's like a porn
movie with the sex scenes remo\ed.
W ell, most of the sex scenes anywav
the chubby, past\ protagonist
director does treat himsell to a
(liasteh filmed roll in the ha\ with a
cute mountain hiking girl and a
sexv attorney. The mild amusement
value ol the ugly-nerd-gets-hot-girl
scenario does not make up for the
fact that Woody Allen beat this
cliche to death years ago (and in
real life too!).
I he rest of the plot is neatly sum
marized hi its entirety in the

preview: our hero josh goes
from temp worker to
"perm," is asked to mail
some letters, procrastinates
for several clays and then
mails them. "My Dinner
With Andre" had more
twists .md turns than this
movie.
Most of the main characters


I'm way too tall for your sick fantasies

in ilie film arc played by Bay
\rea stage actors (supposedly,
Kornbluth onl\ hired lead ac
tors who had worked as temps
or secretaries). Brian
I horstenson, a sort of white,
muted version of ( '.litis I'uck
er, is vagueh entertaining as .1

ga\ coworker. And Helen Shu
maker plays the grimly mascu
line head secretary Marlina
with a laudable air of lidded
menace. There is even a cameo
by the great Harry Shearer,
the voice of Mr. Burns and
Ned Manders on the Simp
sons. Bv and large, these are
< learlv quite good actors, ham
pered onl\ b\ the fact that they
are delivering lines from an in
tensely, almost unwatchably
boring script.

If you have ever worked as a
temp, there's a chance that
some ol the situations in this
film will resonate humorously
with your experience. But
then again, if you've ever been
a temp, vou probably have of
fice stories yourself that are
loads funnier than this one. So
instead of seeing "Haiku fun
nel," go in to the office fora
couple of hours.
You'll find more laughs
there.
