Don't Say a Word
20th Century Fox

Piatt thrown in lor good mea
sure. \ thriller plot, with two ap
parently separate mysteries
coming together in a dramatic
tin.ile. Beautiful young women
it * i

I 111 danger. Explosions
I .ind killings for I Ik*
I gu\ s, strong women
I .ind a tearjerker ending
I loi ilh- gals — the per-
I left date lilni.
It's a good mix. but
somehow "Don't Say A
Word" fails utterly to
I siiceeed as a good
iln iller.
I he premise is sim
ple: Kli/abeth, a young
I woman in a mental in
stitution (Brittany
Murphy), knows the
whereabouts of .1 very
expensive jewel. The

bad guy. Patrick Roster (Sean
Bean), kidnaps the daughter ol
Dr. Nathan Conrad, her shrink
(Michael Douglas) .uul orders
the shrink to get the jewel's lo-

cation from the gal. Aggie
Conrad (Fainke |anssen).
Dr. Conrad's wife, is
bedridden with a broken
leg and at the men v ol the
baddies.
Meanwhile, a < ouple of
dead bodies have ap
peared in the river, so

plucky voung homicide detec
tive Cassidy (Jennifer F.sposi
to) is investigating.
I nfortunately. "Don't Say A
Word" has two lai ge flaws and a
host of minor failings. The

script is full ol abysmally
cliched lines and characters
who never quite break into
three dimensions. It is also full
ol plot holes and loose ends.
Fven if one brushes aside
Hollywood simplifications and
stereotvping (of course shrinks
can gain a patient's trust in
slantly in I lollv wood, and all Ic
tnale detectives have streaked

hair and perfect makeup), the
fact that most of the c harac ters
in the film behave erratically
makes it almost impossible to
buy into them.
All this is not to sav that
"Don't Sav A Word' has no re
deeming qualities. Fainke
Janssen's Aggie is often deter
mined <ind more than able to
defend herself when attacked

without needing a man to
run to her rescue. I he kid
napped daughtei is intelli
gent enough to make
friends with hei ( aptoi s be
fore trving anything. Sean
Bean and Olivei Piatt are
always good, and they do
ciuite well with what they're

given (which, isn't much).
Unfortunatelv, those good
aspects are outweighed by the
bad ones, mam of which
would have been easy to lix.
I he huge age gap between
Douglas and |anssen could
have been dealt with interest
ing! v, but instead t he audience
is expected to ignore the fact
that lie's old enough to be bet
fat her.
Mali's character is essential
ly .1 plot de\ ii e, and the tin\ at
tempt to give him some depth
is lost almost immediatch
when he vanishes Irom the film
without resolution o! an\ kind.
One wonders il a couple ol 11i n
s( enes were edited out.

Overall, "Don't
Say a Word" is ,i
lil in worth seeing
only if you're .1 Can
of one of the actors,
and maybe not
even then.
It's not had
enough to be 1111111 \
and not good
enough to be a
solid 1 hriller.
It is merely
mediocre, and
there are too main
good films out
right now to waste
your time 011 it.
