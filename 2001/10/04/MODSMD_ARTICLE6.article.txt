### NINA CANN-WOODE STAFF WRITER 
This July, rates for monthly health
care coverage increased for all students
with dependents by roughly 20 pet
cent, leaving some graduate students
with uncertain futures. The increase in
coverage costs was the result of a swit< It
in insurance providers.
Cowell Student Health Service Di
rector Dr. Ira Friedman announced
the increase in July, adding that Stan
ford had secured a Preferred Provide!
Option plan for dependents from
Health Net, a California-based health
insurance provider. Dependents were
previously covered by a Health Net
maintenance organizat ion.
"While the coverage remains cjuite
comprehensive and there is more flexi
bility in choosing a clinician, the family's
share ofcosts for each service is higher.
Friedman said.
The monthly rate foi spouses stands

at SI 11, a 16-percent increase over last
year. I lie rate for one t hilcl is $95, a 22-
perc cut increase, and coverage for two

As of late |uly, several questions re
mained unresolved regarding students
with dependents. One concerned in

Stanford on a |-1 visa. At first, students
were worried that they would violate

Friedman stressed that no student
has liiced deportation.
"I am happ\ to report that that this
[deportationj turns out not to be a
problem,'' he said. "We have clarified
this with the- INS, with county health of
fit ials ,md with legal counsel. Children
ol studentson visas can, and should, en
roll in county-sponsored health insur
ance programs without violating the
visa rules.
"These health insurance programs
do not involve public funds the way
INS defines it."
Friedman added that same-sex do
mestic partners are also no less eligible
to enroll in the new plan.
