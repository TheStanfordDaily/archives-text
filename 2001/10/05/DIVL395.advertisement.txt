The Islamic Society of Stanford University and
the Office for Religious Life
invite the university community to an open
Muslim prayer service
which will address the recent tragic events on the East Coast.
Friday October sth
l:30-2:00pm
Outside in the Old Union Courtyard
After a brief welcome by Provost John Etchemendy, the prayer leader will give a short
sermon dealing with the Islamic view of such terrorist acts, entitled "How the Terrorists
Tried to Hijack Islam." The service will end around 2:00 p.m. at the conclusion of regular
Friday Muslim prayers. We hope you all can attend.
Background
As many of you know, the Islamic Society of Stanford has received a number of hate emails (originating from out
side the campus community) during the past few weeks. However, we have received many more emails of under
standing and encouragement from our classmates, professors, and administrators. We sincerely thank the
university community for its tremendous outpouring of support during this difficult time. It is our hope that the
Stanford community will be a catalyst in helping all Americans understand the difference between vile terrorists
and their peaceful American Muslim neighbors. To increase the understanding of Islam on campus we invite the
entire Stanford community to attend our Friday October sth worship service. The Muslim community at Stanford
will be honored by your presence.
For more information contact the Islamic Society at 22.V21W \3949 or the Office of Religious life at 723-1762.
