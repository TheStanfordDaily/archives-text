Many other aspects of leinstein's program
should he speedily authorized, as student
visas are a prime source of immigration
abuse. It is difficult to ensure that students
actually enroll at the schools they have ap
plied to, and it here are lew systems to ensure
they leave the country alter their visas ex
pire. Kcinstein has proposed giving the INS
$!i2 million to implement a tracking system
lor student visas. She has also suggested new
requirements foi schools enrolling foreign
students to track them.
I he six-month moratorium to implement
these proposals is unnecessary, though. The
government should he ahle to put these pro
grams into place without shutting oil all new
student visas.
The government does not shut down the
border with Mexico w hen it puts new border
dossing requirements into place. ( ertainly it
should be able to proc ess student visas — of

which there are many fewer than border
crossings — while it works out the new rules.
Feinstein's program is idealistic, but it is un
necessarily harsh in its implementation.
Luckily, we can do something about this
proposed change. We urge you to write to Fe
instein, Sen. Barbara Boxer and Rep. Anna
F,shoo, as well .is the representatives and sen
ators from your home state. Let them know
your views on this proposed rel<h id and how
it would hurl Stanford and all universities
across the country.
I'he loss of 800 new international students
in the tall would be a serious detriment to
Stanford and to all schools in the United
States. Foreign students contribute greatly to
the I niversity, and indirectly, to the country,
in many wavs. Since Americans value both
immigration and education so highly, it
would be inappropriate to shut out foreign
ers looking to improve their minds.
