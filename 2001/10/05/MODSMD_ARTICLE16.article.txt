Nothing like that has happened in Indone
sia this time around, but when I gatliei with
othci Americans here, we siill atlmit to a
nagging sense ol unease about where
events here are headed il. and when, the
I S. responds it) the terroi isi alt.it ks.
Siidtlenlv, all the shouts ol " I If Ho in is

have taken on an ominous tone, at least in
mil minds. We look ovei om shoultlei
more often to see il anvoiie is lollowing:

and joke about buying guidebooks lot Sui

in Indonesia |iisi live vears ago. l or the

bating the countrv s role in an\ interna

ilarx. Ms reputation tarred under previous
dictatorships, has provide protection
where needed, but hasn't intervened to
t rush opposition as it did in 1098.
l or heller or worse, those ol us still liv
ing in Indonesia are watching a vibrant,
unpredictable form of democrats in ac
tion in a wax seldom seen in the I S. We
can't foresee where this countrx is headed
in llie coming <laxs and weeks, but as we
gather at our own watering holes and
share the dax's latest news, we raise a toast
to the progress made here so far while
hoping that the fragile peace within this
kex I „S. alb will remain.
