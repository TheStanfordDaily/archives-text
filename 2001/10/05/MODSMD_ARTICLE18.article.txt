condemnation of' American and Israeli a<
lions in Lebanon, he coiiipleteb ignores
the historical context in which those ac

that these were unprovoked ads ol I nited
States-Israeli aggression, when in realitv
the) were acts ol defense.
Ileiniu criticizes the I nited States lot
giving Israel a green light to invade
Lebanon in 1982. W hat he forgets to
mention is that Lebanese soldiers and
civilians had been attacking Israeli vil
lages for ,'M years. In 1981, the I nited
States actually brokered a cease-fire be
tween Israel and Lebanon.
• Nevertheless, in the following II
months, the Lebanese forces committed
270 cross-border terrorist attacks, result

that the I nilctl Stales encouraged xio

Support for Jim Clark's decision
I find ilit' Stanford community's near
unanimous disapproval of Jim ('.lark's de
cision to suspend $60 million of his $150
million contribution to the new Bio-\ (fil
ter to be short-sighted.
As Clark clearly explained in his New
York limes editorial which announced
the decision. President (leorge W. Bush's
decision on federal stem cell research
funding, if unnioderated. threatens to halt
scientific pr< >gress in this area f< >r the entire
country. Academic research is heavily re
liant on federal funding as many at this
university are well-aware. I he $60 million
that Clark is suspending is peanuts com
pared to what this and other universities
will be missing out on due to the pro-life
pandering decision of the Bush adminis
tration. lhe entire field appears likel\ to
move overseas. Suggestions that the lack
of federal support can be made up for with
private donations are naive.
No one can question (.lark's generositv
and loyalty to Stanford. He clearly stated
that his donation was "suspended", not
"cancelled". I imagine that I niversit\
President John 1 lennessy will 112 ind a wa\ to
coax him to reinstate it at a later date. In
the meantime, lie's used his fortune to
make an important political statement thai
is important not onlv for research at this
University, but for the victims of the dis
eases which stem cell research nia\ provide
cures for.
I salute his activism and idealism.

Nicholas Chan's article on the revised
speaker selection prcxess is comforting

more visible, the only signific ant c hange is
that students ma\ now see who other siu
dents have previouslv nominated, l'he
pnxess of collecting student input is un
changed. and the- final decision on speaker
invitation still belongs to I niversitx Presi

dent John I lennessy.
List year, the Senior ( '.lass Presidents e
niailed the entire class and asked students
to submit nominations for commencement
speaker. More than a quarter of the class
submitted ideas via the Web, by e-mail or
phone. When students stopped submit
ting names nearly two months later, the
entire list of student nominations was com
piled In the ( lass Presidents and delivered
to I lennessv' s office. The list was diverse:
political leaders, musicians, authors, engi
neers, entrepreneurs, athletes and Stan
ford students themselves were included.
( .111\ Fiorina was among those nominees.
W hen Fiorina accepted I lennessv's in

had been refused a voice in the nomina

orable speech that was appropriate for the
occasion and addressed students' concerns
for the future.
M\ advice to the ('.lass of 2002 is to
make your voice heard. Your ( '.lass Presi
dents have clone a great job of announcing
the selection process, and now it's your job
to contribute. II vou feel strongly about
someone, make your opinion known. In
clude information on the nominee's back
ground and win they would be an excel
lent speaker. All of this information will
strengthen your nomination, lhe un
voiced opinion, on the other hand, is
never considered.
Whoever is pic ked, trust that your fel
low students and President Henness\ have
picked an excellent speaker. As President
I lennessv's letter states, realistic factors
such as scheduling and travel are impor
tant considerations. Also remember that
not even one invited will accept the offer,
although Stanford is a great place to be,
not everyone in the world knows it.
Seniors, we wish you the best of luck in se
lecting a commencement speaker.

As Clark clearly explained in his New

the decision. President (leorge W. Bush's
decision on federal stem cell research
funding, if unnioderated. threatens to halt
scientific pr< >gress in this area f< >r the entire
country. Academic research is heavily re

university are well-aware. I he $60 million
that Clark is suspending is peanuts com

will be missing out on due to the pro-life
pandering decision of the Bush adminis
tration. lhe entire field appears likel\ to
move overseas. Suggestions that the lack
of federal support can be made up for with
private donations are naive.
No one can question (.lark's generositv
and loyalty to Stanford. He clearly stated
that his donation was "suspended", not
"cancelled". I imagine that I niversit\
President John 1 lennessy will 112 ind a wa\ to

Response to The Reasons for Hate'
We would like to respond to |oel
llcinin's guest column liom I uesdav enti
tled " I he Reasons loi Hate. " In Keinin's
condemnation of' American and Israeli a<
lions in Lebanon, he coiiipleteb ignores
the historical context in which those ac
tions occurred. He would have lis believe
that these were unprovoked ads ol I nited
States-Israeli aggression, when in realitv
the) were acts ol defense.
Ileiniu criticizes the I nited States lot
giving Israel a green light to invade
Lebanon in 1982. W hat he forgets to
mention is that Lebanese soldiers and
civilians had been attacking Israeli vil
lages for ,'M years. In 1981, the I nited
States actually brokered a cease-fire be
tween Israel and Lebanon.
• Nevertheless, in the following II
months, the Lebanese forces committed
270 cross-border terrorist attacks, result
ing in over !U)() Israeli casualties. I o claim

that the I nilctl Stales encouraged xio
lf in t' ant I that Israel hat 1 no reason loi in
vading Lebanon is Inllx ignorant ol the
pret t tling events. lU'inin also claims that
the Israeli operation m Lebanon resulted
in I 7..">()() t ix iliau i asualtics. M<»st ol ihese
casualties were attnallx due to the ongo
ingt nil xvai in I ebanon between Muslims
and ( In istiaiis. I lie massacres in the x il
lagcs ol Sabra and Shalila were t an.set lln
I vbancse militia.
beinin wants the I nilctl Slates and Is
i at-1 to leexaluatc tlieii ptilicies in light of
the Sept. 1 I aitai ks. Perhaps it would be
useful lot the \rahs to reevaluate their own
policies toward Israel and the I nilctl
States. In 1082. tlicx should have triftl to
untlerstantl win Israel fell the need toat

Corporate-academic partnerships can
produce 'advance after advance'
lli.ist lirisMK hoidis's letter regarding |im
(llai k's suspension ol his donation ccrtainU
sounded grandiose. I read words like "black
hole ol pel son.il interyst" and "ghosts of the
Last India Company" and 1 cringed. I lie
oblicjiie coin pa I ison between "\.i/i s< ienc e"
and our current scientific and engineering
institutions certainb got my attention.
What is ii that so bothers Ilias? Alter all,
the c urrent svstem of university research
translerred to private companies has cer
tainly produc ed advance after advance. I le
is awfiillv c](iiet on the details. Let me pro
vide my own opinion. Commcrciali/ation
ol our university research, though left un
defined .iticl vague, refers to the close ties
between academic research and private
(orporations. Ibis includes exchange of

information and binding ol research. as
well as technology transfer from university
to industrv. IVrson.ilK, I am perfectly
happx uith thei lose degieeol ( oc>peratic»n
between the I nixersitx and c orpor.itions.
Inlormation Hows both xvaxs and money
our wax. which .ill enable further knoxvb
edge and advances.
Knowledge colonialists? W hat? I hope
I lias can explain this .1 bit more because I
have no due what he is talking about. It
certaink sounds bad. ('.onsidcring most re*
search at universities is published, it cer
lamb is made public. Problems do arise
though. Should a researcbei with govern;
mcnt funding delavs publishing so that Ins
patents can go through? I low about until
bis compam finds startup funds? Ibis
strain on the free c\< Ilangc of information
is a valid coin ern that the ac ademic institu;
tions are dealing with. I hardlx would say
that we are under attack from"know ledge
colonialists" though.
"Never has mone\ made a scientist?'!
Ibis is clearlx written b\ someone who
places bis ideals belot e bis head, becauscj
science certainlv does take inonex. and q
lot ol it. I lie I niversitx is right to accept
money from a varietx ol sponsors so as to
maximize scientific and technological
output, so long as it can maintain its ide»
als. I his requires constant re-evaluatiotl
from the administrators, though half?
baked notions such as this add little to
the discussion.
Regarding the ostensible purpose of his
letter, I am willing to xvager that |ini
(.lark s withdrawal ol funds has little to d<)
with teaching the government a lesson or
blackmailing Stanford. Probably, it has
more to do with the realities of the stock
market. No need tooverdraniatize.

Support for Jim Clark's decision
I find ilit' Stanford community's near
unanimous disapproval of Jim ('.lark's de
cision to suspend $60 million of his $150
million contribution to the new Bio-\ (fil
ter to be short-sighted.
As Clark clearly explained in his New
York limes editorial which announced
the decision. President (leorge W. Bush's
decision on federal stem cell research
funding, if unnioderated. threatens to halt
scientific pr< >gress in this area f< >r the entire
country. Academic research is heavily re
liant on federal funding as many at this
university are well-aware. I he $60 million
that Clark is suspending is peanuts com
pared to what this and other universities
will be missing out on due to the pro-life
pandering decision of the Bush adminis
tration. lhe entire field appears likel\ to
move overseas. Suggestions that the lack
of federal support can be made up for with
private donations are naive.
No one can question (.lark's generositv
and loyalty to Stanford. He clearly stated
that his donation was "suspended", not
"cancelled". I imagine that I niversit\
President John 1 lennessy will 112 ind a wa\ to
coax him to reinstate it at a later date. In
the meantime, lie's used his fortune to
make an important political statement thai
is important not onlv for research at this
University, but for the victims of the dis
eases which stem cell research nia\ provide
cures for.
I salute his activism and idealism.
