Response to The Reasons for Hate'
We would like to respond to |oel
llcinin's guest column liom I uesdav enti
tled " I he Reasons loi Hate. " In Keinin's
condemnation of' American and Israeli a<
lions in Lebanon, he coiiipleteb ignores
the historical context in which those ac
tions occurred. He would have lis believe
that these were unprovoked ads ol I nited
States-Israeli aggression, when in realitv
the) were acts ol defense.
Ileiniu criticizes the I nited States lot
giving Israel a green light to invade
Lebanon in 1982. W hat he forgets to
mention is that Lebanese soldiers and
civilians had been attacking Israeli vil
lages for ,'M years. In 1981, the I nited
States actually brokered a cease-fire be
tween Israel and Lebanon.
• Nevertheless, in the following II
months, the Lebanese forces committed
270 cross-border terrorist attacks, result
ing in over !U)() Israeli casualties. I o claim

that the I nilctl Stales encouraged xio
lf in t' ant I that Israel hat 1 no reason loi in
vading Lebanon is Inllx ignorant ol the
pret t tling events. lU'inin also claims that
the Israeli operation m Lebanon resulted
in I 7..">()() t ix iliau i asualtics. M<»st ol ihese
casualties were attnallx due to the ongo
ingt nil xvai in I ebanon between Muslims
and ( In istiaiis. I lie massacres in the x il
lagcs ol Sabra and Shalila were t an.set lln
I vbancse militia.
beinin wants the I nilctl Slates and Is
i at-1 to leexaluatc tlieii ptilicies in light of
the Sept. 1 I aitai ks. Perhaps it would be
useful lot the \rahs to reevaluate their own
policies toward Israel and the I nilctl
States. In 1082. tlicx should have triftl to
untlerstantl win Israel fell the need toat
iat k I .ebanon.

Corporate-academic partnerships can
produce 'advance after advance'
lli.ist lirisMK hoidis's letter regarding |im
(llai k's suspension ol his donation ccrtainU
sounded grandiose. I read words like "black
hole ol pel son.il interyst" and "ghosts of the
Last India Company" and 1 cringed. I lie
oblicjiie coin pa I ison between "\.i/i s< ienc e"
and our current scientific and engineering
institutions certainb got my attention.
What is ii that so bothers Ilias? Alter all,
the c urrent svstem of university research
translerred to private companies has cer
tainly produc ed advance after advance. I le
is awfiillv c](iiet on the details. Let me pro
vide my own opinion. Commcrciali/ation
ol our university research, though left un
defined .iticl vague, refers to the close ties
between academic research and private
(orporations. Ibis includes exchange of

information and binding ol research. as
well as technology transfer from university
to industrv. IVrson.ilK, I am perfectly
happx uith thei lose degieeol ( oc>peratic»n
between the I nixersitx and c orpor.itions.
Inlormation Hows both xvaxs and money
our wax. which .ill enable further knoxvb
edge and advances.
Knowledge colonialists? W hat? I hope
I lias can explain this .1 bit more because I
have no due what he is talking about. It
certaink sounds bad. ('.onsidcring most re*
search at universities is published, it cer
lamb is made public. Problems do arise
though. Should a researcbei with govern;
mcnt funding delavs publishing so that Ins
patents can go through? I low about until
bis compam finds startup funds? Ibis
strain on the free c\< Ilangc of information
is a valid coin ern that the ac ademic institu;
tions are dealing with. I hardlx would say
that we are under attack from"know ledge
colonialists" though.
"Never has mone\ made a scientist?'!
Ibis is clearlx written b\ someone who
places bis ideals belot e bis head, becauscj
science certainlv does take inonex. and q
lot ol it. I lie I niversitx is right to accept
money from a varietx ol sponsors so as to
maximize scientific and technological
output, so long as it can maintain its ide»
als. I his requires constant re-evaluatiotl
from the administrators, though half?
baked notions such as this add little to
the discussion.
Regarding the ostensible purpose of his
letter, I am willing to xvager that |ini
(.lark s withdrawal ol funds has little to d<)
with teaching the government a lesson or
blackmailing Stanford. Probably, it has
more to do with the realities of the stock
market. No need tooverdraniatize.
