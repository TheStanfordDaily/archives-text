## Looking for safety in learning: the case for relationship rules 
### REVEREND MAURICE CHARLES GUEST COLUMNIST 
Now that ilit' school \ car is underway.
I have a question for you: W ho's your
hottest professor? (And lor the octasion
al faculty member who picks up I lie
Daily but won't admit it. who's your
hottest student?) Okay, you've giggled
and guffawed and wondered il your
friendly neighborhood » haplain has lost
his mind. Now let's talk seriously.
()ne of the things that makes learning
so exciting is that our best teai liei s liter
ally turn us on to new ideas. I .et's fat e it.
we're more likely to pa\ attention to
someone we find attractive. We learn
best from someone who can make ideas
come alive.
Though we puritanical Americans
particularly are loathe to admit it. teat li
ing and learning is erotic business,
rhose of us who teach and otherwise
work with students do so because we love
students — their energy, sense of won
der, enthusiasm antl freedom to explore.
Students devote themselves to hard
work particularly when the\ appreciate
the attention and genuine concern tli.it
leat hers offer and find both the subject
and the presenter compelling. Intellet -
tual curiosity and acumen aside, we
learn best when our hearts, even out
bodies, are engaged.
But as my bishop often reminds me.
being human can be mess\ business. And
it is not alwavs so eas\ to distinguish be

tween feelings of admiration, affection,
attraction and appreciation. Occasional
ly mutual attraction is so complex and
intense that maintaining an appropriate
relationship is exceedingly challenging
for both sides.
I nlortunateb. the free and open spir
it ol Stanford I nivcrsity extends U) our
polit us govet ning student and faculty in
teraction.
In short, there are none. I lere, where
the winds of freedom blow perhaps a bit
too freely, romantic or sexual relation
ships between partners of unequal sta
tus are forbidden only In common
sense. \o code ol conduct exists, which
is it-ri ibl\ unfortunate.
Now I do not mean to sound like the
kind of I'm il.in <li\ ine to which I alluded
earlier Quite the contrary. I think that
humanity, in .ill its delightful niessiness,
is ,111 cxtraordinan gift. As the primary
text of ni\ tiadition teaches me, creation
is essentially good, and I believe that in
i lutles desire, passion and sex.
Rather, it concerns me that we have
insufficient community guidelines to
help lis think soberly in those ti ickv mo
ments when desire tarries us to places
w here it is best not to tread. A communi
ty ol si holai s has the challenging task of
kindling a passion for learning while
keeping the learning environment sale.
Safety works both ways. A student
who is growing intellectually, emotion
ally and ph\sit ally deserves a safe learn
ing environment where he does not

have to fend off advances from those
charged with his education. Likewise, a
teacher, who has her own needs for af
fection and approval, may benefit from
a strong institutional "no" when she has
to ward ofV an inappropriate advance
from a student.
Where candor, sound judgement
and mutual respect prevail, potential!)
disastrous situations grew into deeph
rewarding opportunities for growth
and learning. These situations were not
resolved because of manly moral hero
ism— the institution, whether in the
form of helpful colleagues or codes of
conduct, offered help.
\\'e hear much talk these davs about
boundaries. I prefer to use the word in
tegrity. In this case, it means the act of
seeing the whole picture, how things fit
together best, including the truth of one's
own heart, and behaving accordingly.
It means stepping back and remain
ing true to one's mission as student,
teacher and member of the community
of scholars. It also involves the kind of
humility that allows one to acknowledge
attraction and avoid tempting fate.
balancing the eros of learning and the
desire for safetv is trickv business for am
one student or teacher. Stanford is a
community of scholars. We should talk
about it. together.
