"It is not an eighl-houi jt>l>." Dreier said. " I he

Dreier's list of rt'spuiisibililics includes work

lu addition to coordinating the administrative
aspcctsol the school, principals arc instrumental in

the college application process.
"Principals t an establish a tone ol high expecta
tion antl (hex can empower faculties and student
bodies to slrixe lor the most selet live colleges and
universities." saitl Dean of Admissions Robin
M.unlet.
Dreier pointed out that principals are also re
sponsible for setting the school's tone and vision.
"II xou haw a xveak leader who can't gel the stall
antl students to bin into the xision, then the siall
isn't going to follow the vision."
I his I.it kof direction, he saitl, will be relict ted
in stntleni and leac her morale, xvhich in turn can
allec I almost everx aspec I ol the st hool.
"I'he instructional leader is a visionary lor
w here thai school goes," he said.
Sophomore Denise Rodriguez saitl she recog
nized how her high-si hool principal's ac tions led
to loxv morale.
"M\ principal made, a loi of the leat hers un
happx bet ause he made promises that he could not
keep, like | when he saitl that | anx student who goes
lo summei school would gel a lap top," said Ro
driguez. " I hat is jusi an outrageous promise, es
pet iallx ft>r our selltml."
lu light ol the shoitage ol cjualified print ipals,
some tlisirit is have been overlooking the leaching
and administrative experience requirements lor
lhe job. ()thcr districts have paired nexx or aspir
ing print ipals with retired ones who can act as
mentors.
Alt el 1 saitl she thinks that t hanges should be
made lo the credential requirements for the
position.
" I he (raining needs to be more apprenticcd
basetl, similai lo teat her training." Allcll said. "11
we expect print ipals to be able to be ellectixe,
then xve need lo them opportunities to learn
hi a hantls-on wax (about| how it> be an elleclive
leader."
both Dreier and Allcll saitl I hey think it is es
sential that pi nit ipals be surrounded with support
and leadership so that (hex are not overwhelmed
with the management side ol the job.
\i it I ex en with all the responsibilities and the
long hours, both Allcll and Dreier saitl ibex find
t heii jobs vcrx rewarding.
" I he best part is when I have helped someone
xviili a pit>bleiu and can see their fear, stressor anx
ielx subside," Attell saitl.
