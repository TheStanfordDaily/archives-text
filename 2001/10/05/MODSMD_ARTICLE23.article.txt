I lie game was a hard-fought battle from the

first with a goal In senior l.ars L\ssantl, the team's
si oring leader. I he goal, whit li w.is onl\ the set ond
goal Stanlortl li.is allowed all season, w.is nearh
saved b\ the C ardinal tlefense, barelv crossing the
goal line.
I he 1-0 Spartan lead held foi nearh l.~> minutes
before Stanford responded with a hard shot b\
sophomore Mike W ilson from outside that eluded
the Spartan goalkeeper.

three minutes and 20 seconds later, senior Derek
Shanahan broke the 1-1 tie. Senioi I odd Dunivant

had hi s set (>nd assist ol the game after dribbling the
ball upheld from the defense to Iced Shanahau.
Less than two minutes later. Stanford would
add vet another goal oil of the foot of senior de
lender Lee Morrison to give the Cardinal a 3-1

" 1 he goal got over the line barelv l>\ an inch and
it gave them the liist goal ol the game, but that al

Senior defender Aaron Biddle battled for the ball as he helped the Cardinal defense recover from an early San Jose
State goal and shut the Spartans out for the rest of the match. No. 2 Stanford is now 7-0 for the season.
