Stanford area.
"(lertainh the market is easing up," said
I odd Benson, direetoi ol I lousing Assign
ment Services, "loi students who want to
live off-campus. there are more options
than a veat ago, hut rents are still higher
than the\ were three or font vearsago. So
it's better, there are more opportunities lot
students, hut .it the same time, there's Mill .1

big need lot student allordable housing."

Stiavetti characterized the state of tin
current market as a "signifuant change'

eases of tenants negotiating for lowet ient>
oil their apartments. She also predicted
that area landlords might stall olk-iiny

Kven with these changes, the current
tost of housing has not \ct dropped low
enough to make a dillercnte to graduate
students and others living ofl-i anipus.
