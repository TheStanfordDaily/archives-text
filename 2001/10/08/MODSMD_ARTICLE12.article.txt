Major depression makes an im
portant part of the brain shrink.
Stress seems to he a suspect, but no
one knows how to stop or reverse the
atrophy.
Now, a study of primates' brains
says a European anti-depressant
seems to counter the shrinkage, rais
ing calls for more research to see if
other medications might help people,
too. "These are impressive and impor
tant findings," said Dr. Robert Sapol
sky of Stanford University, who re
viewed the new research, published in
Tuesday's Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Hut, "mind you, this is one anti-de
pressant and...a fairly atypical one "
compared to the drugs most Ameri
cans use, SapoLsky cautioned.
German researchers tested a new
drug sold only in Europe called
tianeptine. The anti-depressants most
popular in the United States, Prozac
and similar drugs, work by blocking
the dissipation of a neurotransmitter
called serotonin that helps regulate
mood. Tianeptine does the opposite,
enhancing serotonin uptake.
