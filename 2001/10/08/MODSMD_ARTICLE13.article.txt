a tradition its followers celebrated Saturday
with an event hilled "Spiritual Revolution in
the 21st Century."
Do/ens of people of various races, skin col
ors and backgrounds'congregated in the Old
Union courtyard to commemorate Ba'l la's,
the son of the prophet-fbundei of the Ba'hai
Faith's, visit to Stanford nearlv 90 years ago.
Followers esteem Ba'lla as a promote) of
world peace and racial unit\. a elefendci <>i the
poor and a believer in equality <>! the sexes.
Saturday's event incorporated prayer,
music. poetry and song.
"'lbelay we are remembering a servant of
humanity," s.iid Cayatri Seth, a doctoral stu
dent in the S< liool of F.chtc ation, in her intro
duction. Ba'l lai believe)s revel in the message
left by this servant, Abdul Ba'lla, a leader in
the faith, according to Seth.
"He spoke to a Stanford audience of ap
proximately 2,000 in 1912," said Seth, and the
faith is still rooted in the same tenets preac bed
by Ba'l la then.
Alim Bevei idge, a Ba'Hai and master's stu
dent in the School of Kducation, said the
Ba'Hai event was particularh meaningful in
light of the events of Sept. I I.
"Perhaps we could look at this tragic event
and see how damaging it is," Bevei idge said.
"A response is very nec essary but I would hope
that the pain, sadness and horroi inspire us all
to work towards peace. I think that is what
Abdul Ba'l la would have hoped.'
Ba'lla first addressed American audiences
in New York with his message of peace and
unity in response' to World YVai I I lie themes
were revisited dm ing Saturda\ 's sei vice in the

context ol the Sept. I I attacks.
Coping with the issue of wai is something
that the Ba'l lai speciiicall\ add)esses in one ol
theit |>i imar\ tenets, whit h Bevei idge said is an
issue lot which "all the religions have a similai
hi in la mental basis, so we 11 \ to fostei events tdi
dillerent philosophical perspectives."
|t-ill Menon, a doctoral student at the
S< hool of Kducation, alluded to a message that
Ba'l lai himself once proclaimed, saying, "1 lie
tenet that all religions are one is revealed to
mankind tinougli the ages."

Menon explained that one is not merely
born into the Ba'Hai faith hnt that one finds
the l.iitli through "independent investigation"
.md the dis< overv of "oneness," another of the
Ba'l lai's pi iinan tenets.
In liei keynote address at the end ol the
ceremonv, Ba'Hai Aim Reed spoke about
Abdul Ba'l la.
"You can see that he lived the life of his
ideals, she said, referring to Ba lla's 10-
vear impi'isonnient and subsequent mission
foi peace.
