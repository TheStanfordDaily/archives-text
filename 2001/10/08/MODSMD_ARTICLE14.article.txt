## The 						Stanford Daily Western reaction meets stated anti-terrorist goals 
### 
Yesterday, we woke up to reports that
I .S. and British jets had begun bomb
ing military and strategic targets in
Afghanistan. While (his news hardly
comes as a surprise, it does provide an entirely
new angle through which to view the U.S. reac
tion to the Sept. I 1 attacks.
1 he bombings came after nearly four weeks
of careful deliberation and attempts by the I S.
government and (lie international community
to avoid conflict. When diplomatic pressure to
surrender Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden
and his al-Qaecla terrorist network failed, mili
tary force was applied against Afghanistan's rul
ing lalihan government.
In the period leading up to the retaliatory
strike, main Americans have debated the role
of patriotism in light of the government reac
tion to Sept. 11. On one extreme, Americans
claimed that national unitv was of such impor
tance- that citizens should restrain from criticiz
ing their government. On another extreme.

some said that the best way to exercise patrio
tism was to oppose governmental action.
Freedom-loving Americans should neither
support nor criticize their government's actions
in a knee-jerk fashion. Instead, they should
carefully deliberate those actions while consid
ering their ramifications in order to form a rea
soned opinion.
()ur opinion is that the recent military ac tion
fits with the stated national goals in the war
against terrorism: it weakens a terrorist-har
boring government, it was cat tied out in a lim
ited, focused fashion and it did not target inno
cent civilians.
Amazingly, according to early reports, no
civilian c asualties resulted from the lii st wave of
bombings. It is imperative from both an ethic al
and political perspective that this record be
maintained. I he U.S. military needs to re
member to focus on terrorism and terrorist
harboring governments and not to make inno
cent Afghans suffci for ac tions to which the\

have no connection.
Just as the the war against terrorism should
not he waged against civilians, neither is it a war
against one man. Should bin Laden be killed or
brought to trial, other terrorist leaders could
quickly spring up in his place. Instead, it is a
wai against the roots of terrorism: its underly
ing finaiu i.il support, its international networks
and its training grounds.
Any government which harbors terrorists
and allows terrorist training within its borders
helps to foster world instability. It is therefore
the duty of freedom-loving peoples to oppose
not onlv terrorists, but also governments which
condone their activity.
So fin, the multi-pronged approat h from the
international conununil) has been appropri
ate: freezing terrorists' assets and pressuring
states which condone terrorism via diplomatic
or, il need be, military means.
While the l .S. government's actions to
date have been sound and effective, it is im-

portant that the mission not creep beyond its
stated goals. Recent history has taught uk
that U.S. military weapons are not always as
"smart as they are touted to be. With each
bombing, we increase the risk that innocent
Afghan civilians will be the unwitting targets
of our attacks.
lb further protect the people of Afghanistan,
i lie I S. government ought to maintain its pol
icy of airlifting them humanitarian aid in the
form of foodstuffs. In addition, ii must pursue
a limited, restrained campaign focusing only
on Taliban and al-Qaeda military and strategic
targets. I he multi-pronged anti-terrorist strat
egy should continue to root out terrorism at its
various sources.
When the stated aims of the U.S. govern
ment's anti-terrorism campaign are met, and
done so within reasonable, rational boundaries
and the blessing of the international communi
ty, free-thinking patriots can continue to sup
port its actions.
