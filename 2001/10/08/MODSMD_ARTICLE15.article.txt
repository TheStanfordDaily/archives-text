# THAT SIDE OF PARADISE
## Polo and the art of deception 
### 
People sometimes pose the follow
ing question: il \ou could return
to Earth alter you die and live as
anv creature, w hat would vou he?
flic standard response is generally some
thing grand, sir h as "oh. a large hawk in
Alaska, surel\" or "a sea turtle because
the\ live lore vet and kids could tide on in\
shell back."
While I too have given these answei sin
the past. .1 ion pie ol years ago I thought I
li.id discovered a superior reincarnation.
More than anvthing. I w .inted to i etnni io

life on t*ai ill .is a Stanford
Men's Watci Polo plavei.
Watching our watci

W hen «m undcrgr.iduate male at Sian

fiicesa difficult decision: he can eithei 11 \ to

possible) 01 mimic it. It's an "it you can't
heat tliein. join tlietn kind of thing. And
thus, sophomore year, in the midst of .1 des
perate fall quarter slump that had me ic
sorting to going to Santa ('.lara parties and
dropping the S-boinb. I "joined" tliein.
I here was ,111 adorable blond girl in inv
house whoseaflections I sought. 1 realized
that because niv drawniates were water
polo players, it would be easy to convince
her that I too was on the squad. Despite
m\ brown locks and uniniposing stature, I
qui< klv duped lici and was in the process
of wooing her when she made the kit.il ic
qucst to attend one of niv games.
There it was: niv seduction had been
neai In complete \vhen suddenh she want
ed proof Of niv varsitx boasts. Ostensibly
the Stanford water polo t-shirt that my
roommate had given me was not enough

ol m\ partnership. In retrospect, I should
have contessed and then repented foi m\
deceit, but, as \ou might presume. I pro
ceeded lo infoi m her that I had a tout n.i
incut that coining weekend.
With that response. I had cHcctiveh
spun inv earnest fib into an elaborate lie.
She went to the game that Saturda\. real
ized that I had been completely unli ulli-
Inl with her. and that night, in the ex
tremely public setting ol ( asa s pizzeria,
she trotted ovei to ni\ table. "I didn't see
vou at voui game ibis 11101 mug." she said
wr\ l\. 1 tut tied to lac e bet, and the cut it e
table tut tied to lac e inc. In the presence ol
mam ol ni\ friends and housemates
(mam of whom li.id ac tualK plavcd in the
aforementioned match), I was forced to
admit my fabrications.
I hat incident inspired me to eonquei
my allium for the- \atsii\ guise, and
though that It.is been agi tin task, ai ec cut
ittc ident affii ins that doing so is ultimateh
loi the best. A couple of weeks ago, one of
inv draw males — a goalie on the polo
team — was featured on a real-time chat
on espn.com. and anyone with an Inter
net connection would pose questions to
him. I he first few questions were profes
sional and docile.
However, about a half hotn into the
c hat, entt ies bearing names like "Bt itnc\.
San Diego and " laininv. Newport
Beach" began coining in, asking questions
suc has "I lev Nick. I think von're hot!
Mow clo I get into your pants?" Ihe
espti.com moderator deftly intervened
and decided it was time to wrap up the
chat. (let tainly. there is no deny ing \ic k's
rakishness, but the fact remains that a na
tion.il cvbciaudience, myself included,
was exposed to the coquettish solicitations
ol tand\ Sc>('.al maidens.
I lencc, if that is the nature of the Stan
ford water polo fan base, perhaps it is bet
ter if we plebes leave our gods to go it
alone. Just as 1 clo not have the physical
skill to play for the team, I am similarly un
qualified and unwilling to contend with
that type of overt female zeal, for now. I
am content to wear rather than pla\ Polo.
