Feinstein's proposal is 'self-defeating
measure'
Alter reading I he Daily's sior\ on the
controversial proposal to freeze foreign
visas, I lelt compelled to write an alert
message. In m\ opinion. Sen. Diane- Eein
stein's proposal, wliic b includes slopping
issuance ol student \isas tot si\ months, is
a self-defeating measure. Stymieing the
inflow of immigrants to this con lit tv isc er
tainb not .in avenue to c reating better na
tional sec urity.
America is a country of immigrants
and the bustle of new ideas and peoples is
what makes il a great one. Icinstein s pro
posal feeds on xenophobia, which might

In- understandable but is not acceptable.
Most foreigners leave their families be
hind and work hard in building ibis na
tion. in the hopes of c reating a better In
line foi themselves. In a poll in the New
York limes in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
87 pcrceni of voters said they would not
irade freedom of speech, religion or trav
el for better security. I errorists are not
bound In nationality, race or creed: the
IWMi Oklahoma bombing (perpetrated
In white Americans) being a c ase.
As a foreign student who came here 2
vears ago, I see the I niied States as the
land of opportunity. Il is on its way to
being the first nation in history to be truly
multinational. In fact, of the 5,745 victims

of the W 1(1 bombing, T>() percent were
foreigners. 1 fiat lells something about
what this country is.
If you want better security, keep better
tracking systems as long as they do no vi
olate privacy. Empower the INS to check
the flow across the borders. But do not
harm freedom, which is something
forged prei iousl\ and destroyed easily. If
Feinistein's proposal goes through, the
terrorists will have indeed won.

Joel Beinin's obsessive anti-Israel
agenda in Tuesday's guest column
notwithstanding, the Arab-Israeli eonHict
and the I .S.'s role in it are not a cause of
the i ecent terror attacks on this country.
I he prepai .itions tor these attacks began
before the generous oiler Israel made at
the 2000 Clamp David summit (Arafat's
answer to whit li was the past \ear's may
hem in Israel), and thus could not be
caused by .in\ steps Israel took in re
sponse to the 011 hestrated violence.
In I.hi. bin Laden s militant hatred ol
the West and its wa\ of life sprang from
the Russo-Alghan wai and the stationing
of I S. troops in Saudi Arabia during the
(■nil War — neither of which had any
thing to do with Israel. Furthermore, bis
organization also seeks to overt In ow sec
ulai regimes in Muslim countries —
again, no Israeli tie-in. Finally, Islamic
terror against Israel itself (b\ I lamas and
Islamic Jihad) first became a st-i ions prob
lem in the vears 1995-90, when the
"peace process" and Israeli concessions
were at tlicit zenith.

America must wage war against
terrorism
In light of the recent string of anti-war
protests on American college campuses
and the dire threat to Americans that lies
in tailing to light terrorism, I consider it
essential that .ill those students who do
support America and its right to self-de
fense make their voices heard. To this
end 1 have drafted a petition in support
of the war against terrorism that will be
sent to the- nation's leaders in Washing
ton:
We, the following undersigned stu
dents. faculty and staff of Leland Stan
lord Junior University, hereby proclaim
our approval for the war against terror
ism and give our assent to the following
three articles:
1. I hat the United States has the right
to and should wage a war of self-defense
against every individual or state that
threatens the very lives and freedoms of
its citizens.
2. 1 hat the response of our govern
ment to these aggressors must be one of
retaliation and not appeasement.
Fbat the Armed Forces of the Unit
ed States of America and its Clomniander
in-Clliief have our support in their efforts
to fight terrorists and the governments
that harbor, aid or encourage them.
Any member of Stanford community
wishing to sign this may do so at a table
that will be in White Plaza, or they may
contact me directly. I encourage any

group wishing to sign as a whole to con
tact me directly.
The need for such a statement is ur
gent, and its cause is just, l'he lives of in
nocent Americans are at stake. I urge any
person who values his country, security
and freedom to sign this petition.

Religious Studies to offer new
classes on Islam
I am writing to bring the communi
ty up to date on the status of Islamic
studies in the Department of Reli
gious Studies. Some readers may re
call the concern expressed in Ihe
Daily last spring by the departure of
Ebrahim Moosa, our visiting profes
sor in this field.
Since then, the administration has
responded to our request for funds to
replace his courses. As a result, we are
pleased to report that Duke scholai
11 ina A/am will be joining us tins veai .is
a visiting lecturer. Ms. A/am, who
comes to us with the strong recommen
dation of Prof. Moosa, will be offering
courses on an introduction to Islam and
Islamic law this spring. Additional
courses on Islam and gender will be of
fered by our Mellon postdoctoral fellow
Jacqueline Arinijo-I lussein during win
ter and spring terms.

I he department also hopes to ex
pand its annual spring lecture on Islam
this year, to develop a public colloqui
um or lecture series. We welcome input
from those interested in helping us put
together such a program.

Apologists give credibility to terrorism
In Tuesday's guest column entitled
"The Reasons for Hate," Prof. Beinin
makes the obligatory statement that
there is no justification for terrorism and
then proceeds to provide exactly that.
Prof. Beinin gives voice to the ap
pealinglv deceptive delusion that if we
just tweak our foreign policy, we could
live peacefully ever after.
Contrary to Prof. Beinin s assertions,
however, America's opponents hate
Americ a not because of what we do, hut
because of who we are.
They hate America because we are
the symbol of western civilization, the
seat of world financial and military
power and a power that does not vield
to coercion.
The perspective provided In Prof.
Beinin is replete with propaganda to
justify Arab "anger." flis claim tli.it Is
rael attacks civilian targets is an out
right fallac\ and Israel's "dispropor
tionate" fone <tnd "extra-judicial" as

sasinations against known terrorists in
exactly the kind ol moialh sound poli
i \ we w ill need to adopt if we ex pec t to
win the war on terroi
Israel captured the "occupied terri
tories" in the 19f>7 Si\ Da\ War, in
which the \iahs threatened to annihi
late Israel, \ltet the war, the Aral)
League gathered in Sudan .nid issued a
declaration: no to recognition ol Is
rael's right to exist, no to negotiations
with Israel, no to Peace with Isiael. In
such a context, continuing to hold on to
strategic territories was Israel's onh op
tion. With i cgard to I rat], there is more

even (iti/.en ol Iraq; however. inno(cut
Iraqis are starving because ol .1 leadei
who chooses to use them as pawns in his
campaign to villifv Aineri< a rather than

I lie apologist attitude ol "there is
no excuse, but" gives <.1 eclibilit\ to let -
rorism and allows it to thrive. II we
seek to justify the acts ol terror on New
York, we can think ol .111 infinite* num
ber of grievances that (.111 he similarh
justified: the Mgerians against the
l'rench, the Indians against the
British, the Koreans against the

of no explanation.
