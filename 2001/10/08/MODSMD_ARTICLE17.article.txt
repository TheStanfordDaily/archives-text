Feinstein's proposal is 'self-defeating
measure'
Alter reading I he Daily's sior\ on the
controversial proposal to freeze foreign
visas, I lelt compelled to write an alert
message. In m\ opinion. Sen. Diane- Eein
stein's proposal, wliic b includes slopping
issuance ol student \isas tot si\ months, is
a self-defeating measure. Stymieing the
inflow of immigrants to this con lit tv isc er
tainb not .in avenue to c reating better na
tional sec urity.
America is a country of immigrants
and the bustle of new ideas and peoples is
what makes il a great one. Icinstein s pro
posal feeds on xenophobia, which might

In- understandable but is not acceptable.
Most foreigners leave their families be
hind and work hard in building ibis na
tion. in the hopes of c reating a better In
line foi themselves. In a poll in the New
York limes in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
87 pcrceni of voters said they would not
irade freedom of speech, religion or trav
el for better security. I errorists are not
bound In nationality, race or creed: the
IWMi Oklahoma bombing (perpetrated
In white Americans) being a c ase.
As a foreign student who came here 2
vears ago, I see the I niied States as the
land of opportunity. Il is on its way to
being the first nation in history to be truly
multinational. In fact, of the 5,745 victims

of the W 1(1 bombing, T>() percent were
foreigners. 1 fiat lells something about
what this country is.
If you want better security, keep better
tracking systems as long as they do no vi
olate privacy. Empower the INS to check
the flow across the borders. But do not
harm freedom, which is something
forged prei iousl\ and destroyed easily. If
Feinistein's proposal goes through, the
terrorists will have indeed won.
