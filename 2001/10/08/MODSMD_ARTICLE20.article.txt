Alter dominating its home
meet in tin- relatively tool North
ern California conditions one
week ago. the No. 2 Stanford
women's cross-country team
traveled to the desert landscape
of Gilbert, Ariz, lot the ASU Invi
tation.il last Friday.
1 lie c hange in climate did lit
tle to detail the Cardinal, unde
feated on the young season.
I lie meet was held during the
late afternoon, when tempera
tures spiked well above 90 de
grees. The heat seeped strength
from the athletes and resulted in
higher than normal times for the
five-kilometer race.
"The conditions were really
hot and the course was slow, but
everyone stepped it up and ran
reallv tough rat es.'' senior Laura
Turner said.
l in net led the Cardinal pack
at a conservative pace for the
first mile. She kept this pace
steady and was able to advance
to the front as faster-starting
runners wilted under the blaz
ing Arizona sun.
"The race was pretty low key
so we didn't go out that hard for
the first mile. I pretty much just
maintained the same pace
throughout and eventually lost
the pack." Turner said.
"The girl who was in second
place was with me through about
two miles. At that point, right
after a significant hill in the
course, 1 put in a surge to lose
her. I guess 1 gapped her in that
last mile," she continued.

I inner won the race in a time
of 18 minutes and four seconds,
with a comfortable 18-second
margin of victory over second
place Fanic e Chepkorir of Cen
tral Arizona.
1 lie win was the first individ
ual meet vic tory for I inner, but
she emphasized the importance
of the team victory over her per
sonal result.
"What was more exciting
than an individual win was the
team victory," I inner said.
"Our team is really strong and
all of us are very excited this
year. It is a great atmosphere for
training and racing."
I he Stanford team placed all
seven of their runners in the top
I 1, showing the team's incredible
depth. Junior Katie Hotchkiss
finished third in a time of 18:31,
followed by freshman Jeane Coff
(fourth, 18:38), freshman Anita
Siraki (fifth. 18:39), junior Lind

say Hyatt (sixth. 18:44), senior
Maurica Carlucci (ninth, 18:37)
and senior Colleen Flaherty
(11th, 19:03).
Siraki and Coll, along with
other talented freslnnan such .is
Sara Bei and Alicia Craig, who
won the Invitational short
course, represent an ama/.ing
pool of youthful talent. As these
runners mature, they should
help the Cardinal to many top re
sults in national level competition
and help ensure th.it the team re
tains its position near the top of
the cross-country hieran hy.
After the points were tabulat
ed, it was clear that the real rate
was for second plate. Stanford,
with 19 points, was clearly in a
league of its own against I'CLA
(81), Cal State-Northridge (82)
and ASU (8H).
