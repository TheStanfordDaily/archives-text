"Everything we do is definitely
a team effort," Eevesque said.
"Everything is teain-oriented and
there ate always gu\s giv ing assists
on the goals i store. Derek's shot
basically hit me and I was lucky
that it went into the net. I'm a strik
er and storing goals is what I'm
supposed to do."
The second halt 'of pla\ was a
more evenly fought battle. Stan
ford struck first in the half off of
the foot of junioi Johanes Mali/a

"Coming into this season there
were a lot of questions about how
we'd do situ e we lost so nianv good
seniors and have a new coach."
Levesque said. "I don't think that
people gave us .i lot of respecl, but
we worked hard in the offseason
and now those questions are being
answered. We just want to pla\
well for 90 minutes, and we have
spurts of brilliance and spurts ol
not so good times in this game.
Sometimes you have a little bit ol
letdown when you have a lour
goal lead, but this goal wasn't due
to a lapse."
I'he Cardinal demonstrated its
depth off the bene Ii in the game as
Simon made 10 substitutions.
"We essentially had a whole
new team in the second hall and ;t
lot of people were playing out ol
position,' Simon s.iid. "It'sdillic ult
to come in oil the bench and get
your legs ready. I think it just took
them a little time to gel the feel ol
