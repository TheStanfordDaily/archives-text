II all and Luchini worked to
gether in the late stages of the
race to break loose from the rest
of the field.
"My goal was to go with
Louis," said Hall. "He was
vellingat ineduring the last mile
to keep going, really helping me
out, so I was keving oil'of him."
I he race marked Luchini's
return to racing. Injuries kept
him sidelined dm ing the spring
track season.
"[Racing again] lelt natural,"
Luc liini said. "I was just glad to
be running healtln again."
Luchini, who hails from
lllsworth, Maine, made his
comeback in front of his home
crowd as he raced against his
brother, Joe Luchini, captain of
Maine's team.
"1 was happy to run back at
home, in front ol nn liunih and
friends," lie said.
Hall and Luchini broke
Michigan's six-year streak ol
placing an individual on the
winner's podium.
Michigan's Mark l'iljia, who
won the meet last vear, finished

third. Stanford juniors Joe I r
banski (24:12.7) and 1 )aniel Har

about where the team is at."
Jennings, who made his
much-anticipated rac ing debut
at kcatinge, is recovering from
an illness that sidelined him at
the Stanford Invitational and is
looking to develop as the season
progresses.
"It's still early in the season

With tin* same dominance
they displayed at the previous
week's Stanford I in itational, (he
second-ranked Stanford men's
cross country team trampled
No. 12 Michigan and the rest of
the field at the Murrai keatinge
Invitational, held Saturda\ at
the I niversitv ol Maine.

freshman Rvan 11.ill. who fin
ished first over the eight-kilome
ter course in .» time of 24 min
utes, 00.4 seconds. Sophomore
Louis Luchini finished on 11.ill's
heels with a second-place time of
24:03.1.
II all and Luchini worked to
gether in the late stages of the
race to break loose from the rest
of the field.
"My goal was to go with
Louis," said Hall. "He was
vellingat ineduring the last mile
to keep going, really helping me
out, so I was keving oil'of him."
I he race marked Luchini's
return to racing. Injuries kept
him sidelined dm ing the spring
track season.
"[Racing again] lelt natural,"
Luc liini said. "I was just glad to
be running healtln again."
Luchini, who hails from
lllsworth, Maine, made his
comeback in front of his home
crowd as he raced against his
brother, Joe Luchini, captain of
Maine's team.
"1 was happy to run back at
home, in front ol nn liunih and
friends," lie said.
Hall and Luchini broke
Michigan's six-year streak ol
placing an individual on the
winner's podium.
Michigan's Mark l'iljia, who
won the meet last vear, finished

third. Stanford juniors Joe I r
banski (24:12.7) and 1 )aniel Har
ris (24:1 1.0) finished fourth and
fifth, respectivel).
I rbanski, who also finished
lourthat last week's Stanford In

from that meet h\ nearh a lull

"()ur goal was to keep .ts ili>se

l\ Stanford did |iisi that, asonl\
I I seconds separated I fill from

1 he next (.ardinal runners to

Sophomores Philip West
(25:34. (>) and Don Sage
(20:59.4) finished 28th and
OOtli, respective!).
Sage, .i regular among the
( .ardinal s lead runners, was
struck with a cramp midwa\
through the race. Despite the
misfortune. Sage remains opti
mistic.
"1 felt reall\ good for the first
three miles belore I cramped
up, so I know I'm in shape to
run well," he said. "I'm pumped
about where the team is at."
Jennings, who made his
much-anticipated rac ing debut
at kcatinge, is recovering from
an illness that sidelined him at
the Stanford Invitational and is
looking to develop as the season
progresses.
"It's still early in the season
for (iabe." said Reill\
('.outran to information re
ported earlier. Mc Andrews
and 11 all ran the keatinge Invi
tational in Stanford uniforms
and are not redshirting their
freshman seasons. No. 2 Stanford
has a legitimate shot at claiming
the national title this \e.ir, and
with a group of highl\ talented
freshmen capable of scoring
points lor the team at the t hain
pionship meet, the Cardinal is
not holding anything back.
Not all leading members of
Stanford's team competed in the

"Mv overall impressions of the
team are great," said Rcilh. "Split
