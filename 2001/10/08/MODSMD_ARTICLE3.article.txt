and other types of diversity .it St.in
fold as some of the University's
most fundamental and important
assets and emphasized the need to
maintain them.
" 1 he norm at Stanford is not just
tolerance of difference," he said.
"The norm is mutual respect and
understanding."
Etc hemendy conc hided his state
ment by urging Islamic students to
propagate an image of Islam as a
faith committed to "peace, mercy
and forgiveness ... [and] in that
spirit, please count me amongst
your first students."
Etc hemendy's presence
demonstrated continued adminis
trative support for the ISSI , whit li
the group's spokesperson, senior
Sohail Yousuf. called "absolutely
outstanding."
A Muslim call-to-prayer fol
lowed Etchemendy's remarks. Ab
dullah then began his 20-minute
sermon, titled, "I low the Terrorists
I lied to I lij.u k Islam."
Abdullah alternated IxHween di
rectly addressing Muslims and

I le urged Muslims not to become de
pressed but rather to use these events
to reconnect with Islam, and he
st ressec 11 hat t he tern >i ists en< 1< >rse( 1 a
brand of Islam not in accordance
with most Muslims' interpretations.
I le emphasized that, like every
one else, the Muslim community
felt both slunk and sorrow in the af
termath of the attacks but should
not feel accountable.
"Despite the fact that we've seen
names associated with this heinous
crime that are Muslim sounding,
we really should not feel any associ
ation or therefore any overw helm
ing sense of guilt for that, .is Mus
lims." he said.
"As Muslims we can only associ
ate ourselves with the people who
committed this d ime as our (',hi ist
ian brothers and sisters for example
associate themselves with timothy

McVeigh," he added.
Abdullah urged Muslims to take
this opportunity to study Islam
from its pure sources and con
demn extremism.
"\\'e have to make sure that we,
as Muslims, are completely immune
from extreme ideas and interpreta

has no place in our religion."
Abdullah also praised the com
munity's support for Muslims, es
pecially Muslim women. The
crowd applauded his statement
that Muslim women should not teai

After he finished, the present
Muslims prayed while the specta
tors observed in silence.
Latif then coin luded the seme e.
saying, "ft really touched my heart
to see so many members of the
Stanford community come out to
support us. Being on this campus is
really one of the best places fora
Muslim to be."
After the service, some students
remained in the courtyard.
Yousuf identified the ISSU's
goals m opening up the service.
"first, [we wanted to] have peo
ple exposed to Islam," he said.
"Second, after something like that,
people might obviously have ques
tions. We felt that most peo pie
have probably never been to a
Muslim prayer service."
Students at the ceremony said
they came out of a desire to under
stand the faith and show support
for their classmates.
"I'm a (christian and I wanted to
make myself aware of what Mus
lims believe," said sophomore
Daniel Yu.
Many Muslim students were ex
cited to see the support. "A lot of
unity c.une out of this," said fresh
man Rania Eltom.

the" show of support.
"1 was delighted with the
turnout," he said. "It was a nice mix
of students, fac ult\, staff and alum

Stanford is."
