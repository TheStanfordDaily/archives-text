and Justice, a group organized
in response lo the Sept. 11 at
tacks, held a peace protest in
conjunction with two other Bay
Area rallies in San Francisco and
.ii the Palo Alto ('.n\ 11.ill.
I he protest was aimed at re
sponding to yesterday's U.S.
military retaliation against
Afghanistan, and more general
ly, American policy in handling
the attacks. Approximately 100
students attended to voice their
opinions, listen to speeches and
display posters and green peace
ribbons.
junior l arek Ghani formally
began the rally by disc ussing the

difficulty of'thecurrent situation
for students who are eager to
show their patriotism but wish to
avoid further violence.
"This is a hard time for all of
us who wish to he patriotic,"
Ghani said. "We've all won
dered what soil of nation we
stand in. It's hard to see polls
of 85 or 90 percent of Ameri
cans who wish to see some sort
of retaliation."
One core issue upon which
Ghani, and the rally in general,
focused was whether "violence
begets more violence. Ac cord
ing to a mission statement dis
tributed in fliers during the
protest, the S( IPJ stated that one
of its main objectives was to
"build a peaceful world.
