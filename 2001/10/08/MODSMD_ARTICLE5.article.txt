# University terminates Channel 51 due to budget cuts
## 
### KATHERINE KELMAN 
Provost John Etchemendy recently de
cided to discontinue 1 he Stanford Channel
due to budgetary restrictions, forcing the
University-subsidized Channel 51 to go
dark on Oct. 31.
The channel was first established as a
pilot project of former University President
Gerhard Casper's Commission on Technol
ogy in leaching and Learning. In early
1995, Etchemendy, then chair of the com

mittee, selected a team of'broadcasting pro
fessionals and communications technolo
gists to program w hat became The Stanford
Channel.
Its mission, as described on its Web site,
has consisted of "promoting the innovative
use of video production in support of teach
ing, learning and research, while extending
the learning environment of Stanford Uni
versity through the creation of video pro
gramming for distribution by current and
evolving technologies."

Over the years, the station has produced
or acquirec 1 <ner 2,000 hours of c< >ntent, air
ing weekly series such as "Life of the Mind"
and "Issues and Ideas" as well as coverage of
special Stanford events and conferences.
I he channel produced " Bec<>tning Stan
ford," the documentary shown at this year's
Ilie Real World: Stanford program during
Orientation. It also broadcasts a 24-hour
Web simulcast of its programming.
Despite general support and apprecia
tion, however, the channel has not been

able to achieve self'-sulliciency. An exami
nation of I he Stanford Channel's media
presence and capabilities, performed this
past year by Graduate School of Business
Prof. David Brady, recommended that
Etchemendy terminate the channel's
broadcast operations.
