The Graduate Student Council (GSC) is
the branch of the ASSU that serves the
interests and advocates on behalf of
graduate students. It is composed of 1 5
graduate students that are elected every
year in the spring, representingthe dif
ferent schools of the University. The
GSC is open to all graduate students
that want to participate and contribute
to foster a vibrant graduate community.
Our goal at the Graduate Student
Council is to improve the quality of
graduate life at Stanford. To achieve
this goal we are active in three main
areas. First, we administer funds to sup
port student organizations and activi
ties. Second, we organize and promote
social events targeted to the graduate
community, such as the annual 4th of
July Barbecue or the Thanksgiving Din
ner. Our third area of concern is advo
cacy, representing graduate students
and defending your interests on impor
tant issues like housing, stipends, health
insurance and childcare. We also pub
lish a quarterly bulletin with updated in
formation about important issues and
upcoming social events for the gradu
ate community.
