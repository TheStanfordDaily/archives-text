## 
### RYAN HUNTER 
The faio of the Palo Alto
Square Cheater has taken yet
another turn, as management ol
the facility has been handed
over to a new company that
plans to show art films.
In March, Kqnity Office
Properties Crust, the com pa in
that owns the theater property,
handed a 90-day eviction notice
to Landmark Theatres, the
company that held the lease foi
the theater at the time.
Over the next few months,
the two companies worked to
ward ,in agreement to keep the
theater open. A 60-day exten
sion was granted to Landmark
Theatres, and a deal seemed
close dining the summer. But
landmark lost its lease on the
property in August.
Michael Collier, a spokesman
for Landmark I heatres, refused
to comment about why the com
pany lost its lease, but said that
Landmark has since been
searching for another Palo Alto
site to open a new theater.
"We are currently looking for
other locations," he said.
But the Palo Alto Square
Cheater will not remain shut
tered forever: it was scheduled
to reopen late last month undei
the management of anothei
company, ('.entury I heaters, ac
cording to a press release issued
by the company in August.
I lowevei, the theater lias not
reopened, and Century I he
atres has not returned I lie
I )aily's phone calls.
1 he theatre's continued clo

sure has proved .1 source of 112 rus
tration to main students.
"I uisli that the company
would get its act together and
open that theatei." said sopho
more Brian klinksiek.
"Palo Alto Square is very con
venient, and it is nice to have
more than just two theaters close
to campus." lie added.
When the theater does re
open. it will be the second the
ater within Centurv's Cine Arts
division, which sliowfj indepen
dent. den umentary, foreign and
art films.
Because of (his, some Stan
lord students complain that
there are no local theaters that
show mainstream studio films.
Currently, the closest main
stream movie theaters are the
Cenlun Cinema 16 111 Moun
tain View and the AMC Merca
clo 20 in Santa ('.lara.
One student s.iid that other
theaters near campus already
serve the art film market.
"We have the Aquarius al
i each, so we d< mi need another
artsy movie place so close to
c ampus," said junior |ennie Wu.
\\ u vtid that, while she enjoys
ait lilins, she goes to see main
stream movie s much more fre
quently. She s.iid slu- might see
fewei movies because of the situ
ation at l'alo Alto Square.
Bui otliei s s.t\ the l'alo Alto
Square theatei nevei did show
mainstream films.
Sarah Weaver, a freshman
and l'alo Alto native, said that
the theater tended to show out
01-lhe-ordinary movies even he
lore the recent developments.
For example, Palo Alto Square
was one of nine theaters nation
wide initially to run " Ihe Blair
Witch Project," which was later
picked up by more than 2,000 the
aters nationwide.
"Movies there tended to he re
garded as higher-culture, not
mainstream," Weaver said.
"Ii was always an arts theater,"
Klinksick notes. "Now it's just a
larger compam that is running it."
klinksick said he hopes that the
new management ol the theater
will maintain the unique atmos
phere of the Palo Alto Square.
"Landmark tended to preserve
the identity of the theater." lie
said. "K.ven though Palo Alto
Square will still play less-main

stream films, (Century might try to
make it conform to their corporate
standards."
klinksiek stated that after the
closure of Printer's Inc. bookstore
on I niversit\ Avenue last year, he
learecl (hat Palo Alto would lose
the sort of\ ultural institutions that
a univet sitv town should have.
"I think it's good that even with
the change in management, the
theater \sill continue to show art
films," he said.
But some students remain un
satisfied.
Weaver noted that in the fu
ture, she'll probably stick to
H.iC.kS, movie rentals and the
Stanford Iheater because of the
lurthei transformation of the Palo
Alto Square I heater.
"In terms of students, that pret
ty much (ills you off from any
thing dose to mainstream Ixvause
it's not worth 11 to try to take pub
lic transportation to Mountain
View," she said.

and l'alo Alto native, said that
the theater tended to show out
01-lhe-ordinary movies even he
lore the recent developments.
For example, Palo Alto Square
was one of nine theaters nation
wide initially to run " Ihe Blair
Witch Project," which was later
picked up by more than 2,000 the
aters nationwide.
"Movies there tended to he re
garded as higher-culture, not
mainstream," Weaver said.
"Ii was always an arts theater,"
Klinksick notes. "Now it's just a
larger compam that is running it."
klinksick said he hopes that the
new management ol the theater
will maintain the unique atmos
phere of the Palo Alto Square.
"Landmark tended to preserve
the identity of the theater." lie
said. "K.ven though Palo Alto
Square will still play less-main

stream films, (Century might try to
make it conform to their corporate
standards."
klinksiek stated that after the
closure of Printer's Inc. bookstore
on I niversit\ Avenue last year, he
learecl (hat Palo Alto would lose
the sort of\ ultural institutions that
a univet sitv town should have.
"I think it's good that even with
the change in management, the
theater \sill continue to show art
films," he said.
But some students remain un
satisfied.
Weaver noted that in the fu
ture, she'll probably stick to
H.iC.kS, movie rentals and the
Stanford Iheater because of the
lurthei transformation of the Palo
Alto Square I heater.
"In terms of students, that pret
ty much (ills you off from any
thing dose to mainstream Ixvause
it's not worth 11 to try to take pub
lic transportation to Mountain
View," she said.
