## The 						Stanford Daily Senior Class presidents, OSA save Full Moon 
### 
Published Since 1891

In remit months, one <>112 Stanford's signa
ture traditions laced the threat of extinc
tion .it the hands of (ampus polities and or
ganizational restructuring. Concern
began to brew w hen the Stanford Alumni Asso
< iation. Full Moon on the Quad's longtime or
ganizer, decided that su< li events were outside
<>l its mission and ahandt>ned its role in the time
honored tradition.
\lthough Full Moon on the Quad may seem
like haphazard (liaos, any (ampus event of its
size requires coordination with law enforce
ment and provision fbi public safety. Without
some sort ol organizational support, the annual
gatlici ing would not have been able to continue.
Afraid ol losing such an important part of
Stanford culture, the Senior (llass presidents
took a lead role and attempted to organize Full
Moon on the Quad themselves.
Initially, the Oflice of Student Activities was

concerned about the prospect of students orga
nizing an event like Full Moon. I lowever, after
a joint meeting, the ()SA, the Senior (llass pres
idents and the Alumni Association agreed that
the presidents could take responsibility for the
event's planning and execution. Through a
rare demonstration of compromise and open
minded discourse, an important part of Stan
ford tradition was preserved.
First and foremost, the Senior (ilass presi
dents saved the dav. Had they shown a little
more apatln or a little less patience with the
()SA, Full Moon on the Quad would now exist
only in the memories of alumni and upper* lass
nicn. They are to be commended for going out
of their way to assume new responsibilities and
serve the student body as a whole. I hey have set
an example of pro-active leadership that should
be modeled l>\ other student representatives.
Secondly, the OSA demonstrated a com

mendable willingness to listen to the concerns of
an important student group. This demonstrat
ed respect for student interest should serve as a
model for future dealings with other groups. As
upset as we all would have been if the ()SA had
vetoed Full Moon, there is frightfully little we
could have actually done about it. Fortunately,
the ()SA listened to the students through their
representatives. In doing so, they avoided the
mistake of destroying such an overwhelmingly
popular tradition.
()l particular note in this case was the OSA's
ability to consider not only the risk of an event
(Full Moon does have the potential for certain
catastrophe), hut also the cultural importance of
that event to the students.
1(H) many Stanford traditions have already
been hamstrung or eliminated entirely out of
concern for liability or the school's image. 1 his
\ ear's Full Moon on the Quad shows us t licit the

()SA lias the ability to satisfy its role ol the con
cerned mother without ruining the spirit or fla
vor of the event.
I he most important thing these parties have
done with regaul to Full Moon is establishing
that the event will continue without the help of
the Alumni Organization, as the OSA has
promised to let future Senior Class presidents
organize Full Moon. It is essential, of course,
that the ()SA keep its promise toallow the event.
For their part, students must respect the deci
sion In displaying some level of decorum and
moderation at Full Moon.
All signs seem to indicate that the tradition
has survived the incidental threats that could
have led to its demise.
At least m this case, Stanford will continue to
he Stanford. We thank those who went above
and beyond the (all of duty to keep this impor
tant part of our tradition alive.
