nodding along as I watc hout politic ians ma

out police rapitlh clamping down. I ven
questions like what we should do ahoul
()satna bin I aden are less important to me
than the\ seem to be lot most of the people
around me.
Its not that l in apathetic t>r detached. I
tare tleepK about what happens. And I
don't believe that these events are late. In
fact, I think we're I tee toe lunge course and
have more influence on others than we
might think
It's just that I haven't heard very many
people talking about something that seems
extrcinch ob\ ions to me. ('.all me arrogant
for not immediately dismissing a thought
not seconded l>\ am one in the New York
rimes — really, call me arrogant — but
imagine with me how an alien or a historian
in the future might view our context:
Now th.it the lossil fuel party is ending,
and they've destabilized the climate, exter
minated the majority of other species and
are tunning out of water, they're going to
Ixliave in unusual ways.
Most ol us are already somewhat cog
nizant that spending out tlavs in cubicles,
for example, is crazy. Main of us are aware
that it's somehow wrong to kill so many
other species. \nd. those who sit in traffic
jams loi hours every da\. despite constant
road-building, must wonder: who would
have thought this was how humans would
Ik- living? Who would have thought that a
human would intentionally pilot a huge, ex
plosive rot k into .1 towering artificial cave?
Who of us would have thought so many
people would at tualK jump from the top of
the World I ratle (Center?
In desperate circumstances, it happens.
Chink ol strained rat populations, the Don
net Party and the (ict mans in the 19305. We
go crazy, though everything seems to make
sense at the time.
It's easier to make sense of insanity by ftv
t using on the ininist tile than explaining sin

gle events narrowly. You could sav, "bey,
( übi( les have nothing to do with overpopu
lation. oi I bat "the plane ( rash that killed
KM) people in Milan Snndax bad nothing to
do with the anget articulated b\ Osama bin
I .aden." and \on might be right But isn't n
more intelligent to look loi larger patterns
and identih events in their context?
l or example, is it realh saitsl.u ton to ex
plain all the violent Ihistration we're seeing
ona stri(th case-bv-case basis? Ihink alxtut
the shootings at Columbine. limoiln
M( Veigh's Ixtnibing, the I nalxtmlxT, the
Rodne\ King riot, the bombing at the
( )lympi( s, people "going postal and killing
theii (o-woikers, the recent hijacking ola
(irevhonnd bus and the Hood ol thousands
ol bomb threats that followed the attacks in
\ew York City and W ashington, 1 ).C.
I'm willing to sa\ there's a trend: people
are simultaneoush more I'rustrated and
able to disrupt the lives of others.
Here's something inv alien historian
friend might add:
When there are more people troweled
together in the same area, and then vou give
them the tee hnolog\ to extend both the dis
tance their voices will travel and the length
and strength ol their hands. the\ will hump
into each other more often.
I his means we can help eat h other more
easily, but also that we're more likely to irri
tate each other.
I lie I tiaboinlx'i can mail Ins bombs to
you; anyone can acquire the makings of a
bomb «ind park u in front of vour ollice
building; and one unmotivated, ininiinuin
wage airport security ollicer might let a
band ol terrorists slip through.and one un
motivated. minimum-wage airport security
ollicer might let a band ol terrorists slip
through.
We can trade and communicatc globally
in order to create a more robust kind olso
(ial insurance and a more ellicient distribu
tion of goods. Hut such inter-connection
also means greater vulnerability to those we
might previously have pushed around.
I lie more I think about it.the more I
agree with the politicians who stress the im
portance of "unit v." But if we're going to de
line the term honestly, we'll sa\ that it is not
a euphemism lor suppression of dissent,
nor does it relet* to any sort of tribal/na
tionalistic unity against anyone.
Unity means understanding that our
concerns are increasingly the same. I care
alxnit how well the people in Mexico are
doing because I'm more secure when
they're better oil. I want this species ofowl to
survive because I want my eco-system to In
stable.
It's not surprising that philosophers, sci
entists and mystic s have long sfxtken of the
unity of all things. Now th.it we live in un
usual times, it is lx>th easier and more ur
gent lot humanity to Ixromc enlightened.
