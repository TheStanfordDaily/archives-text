Geographical gaffe on yesterday's
front cover
I he headline on Monday read "U.S.,
England bomb Afghanistan." While it is
true that Englishmen and Englishwomen
were involved, it was actually all of the
British lorces that took part in the attacks,
as noted in the body of the article. I lie
term "Britain" is used informally and
properly to relet to the United Kingdom
of (ireat Britain (consisting of England,
Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ire
land. To simply include just England
would be the same as reporting that
" Fexas, England bomb Afghanistan."

Senior derides anonymous
FLiCKS funnymen
I went to go see Moulin Rouge at
FLiCKS Sunday night. Though I loved
the movie, I was quite disgusted by some
of the tasteless anonymous comments that

people shouted into the dark theatre.
Now, I don't mind most audience com
ments .it FLiC.KS. In fact, I'm quite
.unused ,it the more i reative ones and feel
that certain movies, such as "American
I'ie, are enhanced In sue h witt\ and time
1\ outbursts.
Vt. !â€¢ LiC.KS-goers need to recognize
whii li scenes of movies lend themselves to
sui 11 comments and whit h ones simply do
not. loi example, I realized some of my
fellow peel s sheet lac k of social sense last
night when 1 wan Macdregor leaned over
to hold Nicole Kidman in one of the mote
tendet scenes of the ino\ ie, and some peo
ple' felt the urge to yell "Rape her!" and
"Show us your tits!"
As 1 shook in\ head in disbelief and
liu \. I asked myself, who are these people
and win might the\ possibly feel the need
to \ell something so < rass and inappropri
ate? Is it outright immaturity? Maybe.
How about an overcompensation for an
inset ui it\ or a general l.u kof self-esteem?
Quite possibly. I )< >es the comment serve as
a desperately desired boost in social status
among one's freshman dormmates? Most
likeh Might the cloak of anonymity in the
dark theatre provide the perfect opportu
nity to reveal the socially inappropriate
and Milgar side of ourselves? Definitely.
Being a social psychology major, 1 im
mediately contemplate the role of mob
mentality, diffusion of responsibility and
anonymity as the root causes of such ab
horrent behavior.
Without the safety and reassurance of
being in a dark theatre and hidden
amongst a few hundred classmates, 1 find
it hard to believe that anyone would make
such crude remarks. As these FLiCKS
comments demonstrate, the sheet temp
tation of a particular sot i.il situation can
completeh trump our malleable social
norms ol decenc\ and respect. We must
each hold sound personal standards to
rise above the tempting dictates of the
powerful sot i.il situation.
As a fresh man, one of ni\ biggest prior
ities timing the first lew weeks al school
was learning how to fit into Stanford and
leel accepted. A tradition was presented to
me, and though 1 did not think through

the implic ationsof my actions, I wanted to
prove m\ worth b\ fully participating, in a
relentless pursuit ol being considered
"cool by m\ peers.
Now, three years later, I have some ad
vice lor anvone wanting to be accepted
like I did: yelling tasteless comments dur
ing certain movies at 1-LiCKS won't win
\on the ac (cptance that you seek; it will in
stead infuriate voui peers who care about
the- men ie the\ are watching.
Rather, handling yourself with class,
inaturitv, common social sense and a re
spect lot others will bring you an accep
tance and warm welcome from the Stan
lord community.
