# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Afghanistan campaign could prove to be a Pyrrhic victory 
### MATT EVANS 
In bombing Afghanistan, the I .S. is
in danger ol winning a ta< tit al \ u -
tor) but ullimatel) suffering a
strategic loss. I be bombing and
othet lone ili.it we use to destro\ bin
Ladens organization could cause out
rage in the Muslim world that would in
turn spawn new terrorist organizations.
In that scenario, we will have won a
tactical victors b\ destroving bin Laden,
but we'll have defeated ourselves strategi
cally l>\ putting Amerit .ins at greater risk
ol atta( k Irom new terrorist ot ganizai.ions
that we don't e\en know exist.
Out retaliation against bin Laden
must be carried out in a wa\ that lauses

the least amount ol resentment possible
in the Muslim world. A bombing cam
paign or ground invasion will generate
more resentment. Ine\itahl\ in these
tvpes ol atta< ks. Afghan civilians will die,
pictures ol their bodies will appear in
newspapets throughout the Arab world
and hatred ol Americans will grow.
I-tightening^, stub a reaction by
Arabs is e.is\ to understand in light of the
fat t that Americans who had never been
to New \ 01 k are now suspet ted of killing
.in Arab-looking shopkeeper on the other
sitle of the I .S. because of images the\
saw on l\ of the New York attack.
Let's also not forget tli.it Afghan civil
ians are just as innocent as the Sept. I 1
victims, and am action we take that kills

tliein w ill be just as morally wrong as the
Sept. 1 I attacks.
If our retaliation spurs more people
towards anti-U.S. terrorism, and more
Americans tlie, then our Sept.l 1 attack
ers will have won an even greater victory,
having caused more American deaths
long after their original attack.
Along the same lines, if we engage in a
ground campaign against Afghanistan
and lose a significant number ol troops,
we t an add their names to the list of casu
alties caused by the Sept. 1 1 attacks, giv
ing those ICJ1 C J attackers an even higher
American death toll.
I want revenge for the terrorist attacks
as much as most other Americans, yet I
have often felt over the past few weeks

that 1 am not a faithful Anient an because
1 don't support a full blow n attai k against
Afghanistan. 1 lie truth is that the most
faithful Ameritans are the ones who care
deeply about destroying bin l.atlen's or
ganization in a way that doesn't spawn
more haired for the I .S. among Muslims.
We must dest ion existing tei roi ist ot -
gani/ations and at the same time attempt
It) keep new ones from forming. Improv
ing our image in the Muslim world can
onlv help (his t .uise.
Many Americans would like to tlem
that the impact we make on the Arab
world during our retaliation will have
am ailed on our future securitv. I his
seems liighlx unlikeh. but even il there is
a chance that the\ are tight, I'm not will

ing to take it. II ihc\ are wrong, then
in.tin lives — unhiding those of my
li iencls .iiul family — are at stake.

h.uhoiing countries we concjuer. Let us
reniemher that the most effective attack
