I'NIILl) NATIONS (AP) — S\ria won .1
seat on 1 lit* I.N. St't iniiv ( ount il vestserda\
with overwhelming support from the nations
<>l the world, despite being on the I S. list of
countries sponsoring terrorism.
1 he General Assembly elected Svria to the
powerful I N. bod\ lor a two-vear term <>11 the
first ballot. It received l(>0 "\es" votes from the
177 nations voting.
Guinea, Cameroon and Bulgaria were also
elec ted on the first ballot Mexico deleated the
Dominican Republic lor .11 .atin Americ an seat.
Syria was the unanimous t hoic e of Arab and
Asian nations for the Asian seat 011 the count il
being vacated by Bangladesh 011 Jan. I ( ancli
dates that have unanimous regional support
an- almost always elec ted.
Last year, the I S. led .1 sue(c sslul i ampaign
to keep Sudan, also 011 the American list of ter
rorism sponsors, oil the count il.
But this year, despite opposition from Israel
and a last-minute appeal from members of
the I .S. (ongrcss to President Bush to oppose
Syria's candidacy, the administration has re
mained silent.
I S. deputy ambassador |atnes Cunning
ham, arriving for yesterda\'s election, said:
"It's a seciet ballot."
Israel's I.V Ambassadoi Yehuda Lancr)
said Syria's elet tion went against the "spirit auci

letter" ol the I.N. Charter, which stipulates
that even candidate lor the Securitx Council
"should prove its adecju.u v in tei ins of its con
tribution to international peace and sec urity."
"Syria indeed bat ks terroi ist groups inside
Syria and outside Svria," Lane r\ s.iicl. "It is
re,ills a sheet absiit <lit\ and a sheer nonsense
to have Svria .is a member of the Security
(Council."
But Saudi Arabia's I V ambassador, l aw/i
Shobokshi,countered \cslerela\ that "S\ riade
serves tt> be a member of the Security Coun
cil ... because the\ represent a responsible
government and the world's people and plav
an important role in our part ol the world."
In an editorial yesterday. Svria's state-run
Al-Baalh newspaper said S\ 1 ia wanted to join
the council out ol its "real concern to see the
world enjoy peace and securitN t>n the basis ol
international legitimacy." It said that with the
start ol the .iii strikes against Afghanistan,
there was "an inc leasing need fora voice that
( alls loi the important t- oft consolidating peace,
sec urit\ and cooperation in this world."
One majoi difference between last vear's
election and this year s is that Svria was run
ning unopposed, while Sudan was running
against Mauritius in a both contested race.
Sudan's L.N. ambassador, Kllatih Mo
hatned Lrwa. said vestcrda\ that there were

dillcrenccs between his country and the U.S.
last year.
Washington declared its position and
"pressed everybody" to vote for Mauritius, .1
sin.ill Indian ()cean nation, he said. "But Syria
is opposed only by Israel, not by anybod\ else."
I lie political climate is also different, espe
cialh following the Sept. II terrorist attacks.
I he I nited States has been trying to enlist
Svria's help in its global anti-terrorism cam
paign, and Svrian President Basilar Assad has
condemned the attacks.
But Rep. Kliot 1.. Engel.a New York Demo
c rat who col lei ted 118 congressional signatures
Frida\ in ,1 letter to Bush, said allowing S\ ria to
join the council would send "precisely the
w long signal to the international commit nit \ at
this ( ritit al time and would be counterproduc
tive i<> America's ellorts to put .1 halt to global
terror."
I he Senility Council, the top I.N. deci
sion-making I>i>il\. is made up of 1 f> members.
Russia. ( lima. France, Britain and the I nited
States hold permanent seats. len nonperma
nent members are elected to two-year terms,
