forced them into many had passes," Detta
manti said. "We pressed their hole men to
set their position far from the goal, and
when the\ did get the hall, they were so far
out that thev weren't a threat."
It wasn't until the last 2.5 minutes of the
game, with Stanford's reserve unit in play,

called some questionable ejections against
Stanford to help the losing teain decrease the
goal gap.
