just how the schedules fall." Powers said.
So far, the Cardinal has started its season similarly to last
year, when Stanford finished ninth and 10th in its first two
tournaments before winning the Fresno Lexus Classic.
I he Cardinal experienced tips and downs all last year,
replacing seminal head coach Wallv Goodwin with Jeff
Mitchell and eventually finishing in the middle of the
Pac-10 heading into the NCAA Regional Championships.
However, Stanford got past its early mishaps and regained
some of its winning ways, qualifying for its first NC'<AA Nation
al Championship since the 1905-00 season, back when Good
win coached Tiger Woods and I S. Amateur runner-up Joel
Kribel to a fourth-place finish.
"A lot of our guys got some good experience last year," Pow
ers said. "But our goals always remain the same: stay competi
tive during the season and make it to Nationals. At Nationals,
it's a free-for-all. because anyone who plays well that week has
a chance to win, and we definitely have the horses to play well."
