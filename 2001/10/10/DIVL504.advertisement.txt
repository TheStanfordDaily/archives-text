D. E. Shaw & Co., L.P. is a specialized investment firm. It was organized
in 1988 to explore the intersection of technology and finance. Today
the D. E. Shaw group encompasses a number of closely related entities
with more than US $2 billion in aggregate capital. But the core of our
business remains the same: sophisticated algorithms that move
hundreds of billions of dollars a year. We may be an investment firm,
but our Ph.D.s outnumber our MBAs.
As you might imagine, we put a premium 011 mathematical and
analytical skills: our staff includes Putnam Prize and Math Olympiad
winners. But we're just as interested in smart people from any back
ground: from computer science to astrophysics, from robotics to
philosophy. We need creative, pragmatic, articulate people who aren't
afraid to implement —and manage —what they invent. In fact, our firm
is largely run by the people who designed our strategies and systems.
D. E. Shaw & Co. will be holding an information 011 Monday, October 22
at 7 pm in the Gold Lounge of the Faculty Club.
Hroker-dealer activities of the I). E. Shaw group are conducted in the United States through
D. Shaw Securities, LA.XI., I). E. Shaw Investments, LA'., or I). E. Shaw Valence, L.P, which
are registered as broker-dealers with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
and are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Investment advisory
activities are conducted through I). E. Shaw & Co., L.P. and I). E. Shaw & Co., L.L.C. Technology
venture activities are conducted through I). E. Shaw Development, L.L.C.

of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status,
sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class.
