1940
I he Dail\ printed an article on Oct. 10,
1910 about the necessity of leadership:
" 1 here are too many 'dub loafers' in
Stanford fraternities who are just wasting
theii time. President Ray l.yman Wilbur
told the second annual Intel fraternity Con
fident e at its l).ni(|iict in I nion dining hall
List night.
Sparking the 70 officers, representing
over SOO lratcrnit\ men, to alleviate this sit -
nation, Dr. W ilbur emphasized: 4 1 lie fra
ternil\ chapter depends upon just one
thing: leadei ship, active leadership.'
(ieorge Whistler, president of the Inter
fialernitN Alumni Conference, and Dean of
Men John Hunn also spoke.
Previous to the concluding banquet,
house managers, rushing chairmen, and
the Intelfrateruits Council, composed of
house presidents, held separate meetings to
foresee the \e.n \ problems and provide an
ounce of prevention.'"
Bottom Line: Fraternities have changed so much in
62 years.
