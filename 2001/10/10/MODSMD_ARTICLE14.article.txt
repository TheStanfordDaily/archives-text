"If you're a citizen of a constitu
tional democracy, you cant really
Junction as a citizen unless you take
'pride in your country's achievements
and feel ashamed of its deficiencies
and have some kind of identification
with it,"he said.
In World War 11, patriotic feelings
were channeled into self-sacrifice
and service, values still held up as an
ideal in contemporary films such as
"Saving Private Ryan."
Even some pacifists in wartime
can't help but feel the pull to join in,
wave flags and sing national an
thems. Jane Addams, a pacifist and
1931 Nobel Prize winner.; once wrote
poignantly about feeling left out dur
ing World War I. "Indeed the pacifist
in wartime . . . constantly faces two
dangers," she wrote.
"Strangely enough, he finds it pos
sible to travel from the mire of self
pity straight to the barren hills of
self-righteousness and to hate him
self equally in both places.
Patriotism is, by its nature, a com
munal experience, a bonding with
others who feel the same way. It may
be more difficult for some dissidents
to feel the patriotic pull of shared
emotion.
