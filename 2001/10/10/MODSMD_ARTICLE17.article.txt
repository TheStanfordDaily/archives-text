W hen Stanford students return to campus
they are frequently l)ombarded with informa
tional pamphlets, housing polk ies and dorm an
nouncements. But two items that usually survive
the recvi ling exodus .11 et he "I noff'u ial Guide to
Stanford" and the "Guide to the Good Lite on
the Peninsula."
I he "I nollk i.il Guide" isc reated l>\ Stanford
students during the summer, while the "(iuide
to the ( >ood 1 ile is produced off-campus by an
independent compam.
I he "I nollk i.il (iuide to Stanford is a divi
sion ol the Stanford Directon and is owned by
Stanford Student Knterprises, which is also re
sponsible for M.iCKS, the Stanford Store and
I ecture Notes.
Director Aldo King, ( lass ol 2001, said the
put pose of the "I 110Hi1i.1l (iuide" is to allow
"students to tell other students everything tliev
need to know about Stanford."
Production Manager Katie l'ipson, Class ol
2001, explained that the guide "is completely
written In students, generated l>\ students and
geared to help students."
I he "I nollk ial (iuide' started as the "Mini-
Pages. a pre-cursor to the I)irei tor\ that began
in 19JM and inc luded l<x al business inlormaiion
and coupons.
According to King, two vears ago SSI took
the 'Mini-Pages one step further l>\ adding
color set lions and photographs and renamed
the public ation " I he I nollk i.il (iuide to Stall
lord." 1 lie guide emplovs 1H students full-time
during the summer to sell advertising, gathci in
lorniaiion and w rite the reviews.
"W e gather our content from the ('.areel De
velopment Center, the ethnic eommunitv (en
ters, (he ASS I . the I la.is ( entci and the Stan

ford Magazine. I King. The photographs

tumn <|iiarter. Ml profits go dirertl\ to the VSSI
to benefit students, King said.
1 lie "(inide to the (iood 1 ile,' on the othei
hand, is geared not onl\ to the Stanford com
niunih Inn to the entire Peninsula. According to
Ivan Kreger. publisher and managing editor,
two Stanford MllA stndent.s founded the publi
cation alxtnt 10 \ears ago l>ec anse they notic ed a
void of Stanford information.il guides.

"Its primary purpose is to direct students to
life outside the classroom," Kreger said. Ap
proximately 23,000 guides are printed annualh
and distributed not onl\ ac ross campus but also
to car rental agencies and hotels, ranging in lo
cation from San Franc isc o to Santa (llara.
Because the guide features main off-campus
resources, Kreger said that "everyone in the area
benefits |from the guide]."
l lie stall includes some Stanford graduates.
Kreger said. 1 his year, the "(iuide to the (iood
I .ile" also employed members of Mixed (Compa
ny, a Stanford a cappella group, to handle distri
bution of the book to students ac ross campus.
Kreger, a trained chel and lormet employee
of Stanford's Parking and l ransport.ition Ser
vices, has been running "(iuide to the (iood
Life" for the past IS months, lie also writes
restaurant rev iews for the guide.
Kreger said that he is unveiling a new Bei ke
lev version of the guide this week that is ".i c ai
boil copy of the Stanford one" in tei ins ol si\ lc.
1 le plans to expand and publish other vei sious
ol the "(iuide to the (iood I ile lor othei uni
versity campuses in Boston, New York and
Washington, D.G.
Kven though Stanford students receive
two guides, the stalf of the"I uollic ial (iuide"
said they don't see the "(iuide to the (iood
1 ale" as c ompetition.
"Their feel is different than ours," l ipson
said. "Students can get both and use both."
While the books tr\ to provide a service to
the Stanford community, student use ol the
guides varies.
"I just throw them away," said sophomore
Kdward Iskandar.
But main students said they plan on using
