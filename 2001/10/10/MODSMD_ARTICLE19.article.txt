A thousand paper < ranes ushered in the
re-opening of ()kada I eahouse in acknowl
edgement ol'the Sept. I 1 tragedy yesterday
in ()kada's lounge.
According to Japanese belief , the crane is
.1 s\ mbol of peat e, and the folding of a thou
sand paper cranes grants a wish.
As the Asian-American theme dorm re
opened its newly-renovated teahouse, locat
ed between its lounge and W ilbur Dining,
()kada wished for peace.
Okada staff also provided a piano and
cello duet, a moment of silence and speak
ers who explained the significance of the
ceremony and thanked the University for
funding the renovation.
John Lim, ( lass of 2001, was a resident
assistant at Okada last year, lie described
the teahouse as looking like an "under
ground barrack" before renovations
started.
Senior Cheryl Andrada, Okacla's head
peer advising coordinator, echoed l.im's

feelings about what used to be the "white
closet."
Huilt in the 19705, the Okada teahouse
u.is littered with mops and unwanted fui ni
tute and often went unused last year.
When members ol last year's Okada
stall noticed the neglect of the teahouse,
they drafted a proposal lor it to be reno
vated this lall.
I hey also formulated a budget and a
blueprint of the building in their appeal to
the University for funding.
Student Housing Services responded
promptly and enthusiastically, according
to Nadinne Cru/, Okada's resident fellow
and director ol the I laas ('.enter lot Public
Service.
" I he timing was right," Cm/ said.
Cru/ further noted the fluidity of the
renovation application process for both stu
dents and administrators.
"In past years, there has been friction be
tween students and administration over pro
posed projects. [The Okada teahouse reno
vation! is one of those projee ts [for which] the
students and administrative stall fell into a
synergy that's ideal," Cru/ said.
"I he level of response that tlieC )kada stall
received is really the ultimate sign of re
spect." she added.
Lim said he is grateful for the renovation.
"Kachdorm has a legacy and history," he

slid. "The thing that ()kada li.is that's part
ly diflerent is the teahouse.'"
In the past, the ()kacla I eahouse hosted
community get-togethers, hungry students
in search of dim sum and tea and even the
playwright David Henry Hwang.
"I he Okada 1 eahouse can be seen as
space. With all these ac tivities, though, the
teahouse becomes more than space. It be
comes a haven," said sophomore |ordan
IVralta. an Okada ethnic theme assistant
and ,i key organi/er ol the ceremony.
for ('.i n/, spaces and havens are incred
ibly important.
"Looking back at last month and all that
happened, there's new sense of urgency
for space," ('.ruz said.
IVralta and the rest ol Okada's stallde
cided .it their stalTretreat to make a special
effort to remember the victims of the ter
rorist attacks.
"Cranes are a way of at knowledging that
incident and the building of cranes is syn
onymous of the people coming together
after the tragedy to help," IVralta said.
Sophomore Pri Juarez agreed. "The
cranes are symbolic of a way ol uniting peo pie
across ethnic lines, unitingthcin in mourning
and in honoring loved ones," Juarez said.
Sophomore Sarita Ocon, an FT A at Casa
/apata, noted how the ceremony and the
cranes transcended cultural boundaries.

Ocon held a study break lot (!asa /apata
Sunday night to aid Okada in the eflort ol
folding cranes. "It's an opportunity to link
arms and participate as an ethnic family,"
she said.
When the thousand cranes were finally
unyeiled, ()con said she felt sentimental.
"When I saw .ill the cranes, the meaning
became even greater," she said. "Today,
()kada did a beautiful j()b with thcccremom
Ocon also said she plans on visiting the
teahouse and taking advantage of its oppor
tunities for communitv building.
"Specifically .is an ETA to /apata, I will
like to use the teahouse to bring ()k,ula and
/apata together, to unite them to work on
projects," (Von said.
At the same time, the Okada Teahouse
will also serve as a place to hang out and
have fun.
"The Okada Teahouse is an intimate
place where people can go to study, unwind
and bond," l'eralta said. "It's a place where
people feel safe.
Andrada encouraged students from
across campus to visit the teahouse.
"People should come to see the teahouse
because it's new," she said.
"Instead of going to hangout at the [Cof
fee House) or to read at the library, they
should come to Okada Teahouse. It's a new
environment," she added.
