## The 						Stanford Daily Bauer will be missed at the Medical School 
### 
I'uhlished Since 1N9I

Dr. Kugene Bauer, vice president ol
tlic Stanford Medical Center, re
cent l\ announced tli at lie will resign
from the position on De<. 1.
I lie Medical Center lias faced mam trou
bles in recent vears, some uni<|iic and some
commonplace. I he proposed merger with
the medical center of the I niversity of ( .11 i
fornia .it San Francisco was an original idea,
hut the attempt to merge the clinical aspec is
ola private and a public institution proved
unworkable. I lit- merger was dismantled,
but the hospital is siill feeling the el Vet is.
Hospitals all at ross the (ounti v are bleed
ing red ink. due to inadequate reimburse
ments from managed-care contract ant! the
government, and Stanford Hospitals and
(Hinit s are not ext eptions.
I lirouuh these difficulties. Kauri and

Medical Center officials have responded to
problems promptly.
In response to fiscal challenges, Stanford
created new programs and made invest
ments in othci programs. When the commu
niis objected to the closing of the (ioastsitle
Clinic t.his spring, the Medical Centei t rafted
a solution that allowed the < liiii< to remain
open to sei vc the public .
W hen a medical journal retracted two re
search papers written l>\ Stanford gvncco
logical surgeons, brothers Caim an and l air
Ne/hat, Stanford appt>inted an outside panel
to investigate the brothers' acadcinit ic
seart li and tlieii records of treating patients.
1 leading off a repe.it of last vcar's r>()-tlay
siiike, Stanford Hospital ami the I.mile
Packard Children's Hospital agreed on a
two-vcar contiact extension with the union

that represents tlie nui ses.
Through the turbuienee, the reputa
tion <»I Stanford School of Medicine re
mained impressive, staying within the
top 10 medical schools as ranked In I'.S
News & YVor Id Re, >ort.
Bauer guided the Medical Center through
each challenge with wisdom and care. Mis
training as a clinician, academic and re
searcher gave him an unique background
and perspective. He arrived at the Medical
School 1 vcars ago as a prolcssoi and chair
man <>! the Department of Dermatology. In
1995, lie became the medical school dean
and then \ it e president two years later. From
1997 to 2001. he served as both vice presi
dent and dean until current dean Dr. Philip
l'i//o took over in the spring.
A recent 1\ appointed executive commit

tee, ( haired In Dean Pi//o, will now oversee
I he Medical ('enter.
In.m e-mail. Bauer said the current lead
ership "possesses the talent, tremendous en
thusiasm and strong value system which lets
me leave knowing that the Medical ('.enter is
in great hands.'
However, the future holds more opera
tional and financial challenges for the Medi
cal Center. In a time when every hospital is
losing mone\ and several teaching hospitals
have been sold, it will take a visionary leader
ship to get the hospitals and clinics out of the
red, promote fund-raising, coordinate the
administration o( the medical school and
deal with the lingering elfects of the failed
merger.
Current leadership will miss Bauer as it
faces these challenges.
