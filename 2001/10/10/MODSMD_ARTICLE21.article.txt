I went l<> till' Mam Quad on I lie
evening ol ilie lii si lull moon in

leresi ing iikllie I ion i u ii.il. M \
Iriencl .iihl I lelt I lie l aw I ibrar\ and
heard pounding drums in the (list.nice.
I looked ai ilie sk\ and remembered a
rit u.i I whit h, in ovei two mm is. had been
ineniioned to me onl\ iwice I>\ two dif
ferent undergraduate students.
We wanted lo observe undergradu
ate seuioi s kissing undergraduate Iresh
men on the nighl ol the In si lull moon ol

IMC I.ill UMIII. I 111 II si
sound like .in .1111!11<>-
pologist. Reall\ . I'm
not, I>tll this sounded
like .111 t'lu 11.mt ill 11 a
dilion. I'liis. I had heard
there would lie a lot ol
nude people. I thought
it would he lun. like .i
trip hai k to the 11 >"»(>>
(when .i < 111\.1111« kiss

meant something) oi even the 19/0s
(when there was more puhlit n lid it \ and
liberation oil sexual matters).
We parked on I'alni l)i ivc, walked up
ihe Oval and saw glimmering white fig
ures daiuing underneath the stairwell
leading to the Onad I thought the lig
ures were robed in while. As we got < los
ei, I noticed the\ were tolalh naked,
lamplight relict ted oil theii skin with
the appcarancc ola radiant cloth.
Booming drums shook the air with trib
al noise. Dancers bounced around to
keep warm, w hit h probabh added a lew
extra steps and a greater level ol lrcn/\
to their ino\ements.
It looked like a Dionvsian ritual or
even a painting b\ Matisse. In ancient
times, \oung \ irgins were pla< ed in tem
ples where thc\ engaged in sex with
male visitors. I hat was an initiation into
adulthood lot the virgins. Acrocorinth
iti (.recce once housed a temple to
Aphrodite, the goddess ol love, where

manners \ isited lot sexual servit es. l'.iul
lambasted those praclites in Ins famom
liihlit a I tellers lo the (ihrisiiaiis living in
neai h\ ( 01 nidi.
I thought am ieni lusiorv was coin
ing alive, in some small lorin, on tin
Quad wnli a mix ol kissing. niulilN and
I lie lull moon. I here were dru ms, a lew
thousand levelers. loudspeakri s, a
beau til ill location and a lull moon. I lie
siagew.isset. I ulort unalelv, I lie adors
seem lo have lorgoilen then pails.
Midiiighl i.une and wi ill I saw one 01
two kissing ((tuples. A voting lemale
si in lent w ho looked nice and wore cal
lings noted, li s midnight, win isn't
an\bod\ kissing*"
I he whole thing was a non-eveiil. M \
Iriend and I estimated iliai onl\ about I
percent ol tlie people actualb kissed.
We bad high hopes — not loi onisebcs
(I'm happih aliached lo in\ girlfriend)
but loi the single lolks at Stanford
I hat there would be an outpouring ol
spontaneous kissing.
I Ins was supposed Io be an inil i.it ion
into Stanford. I'lcni\ ol men were lr\-
mgAei N hard lo maintain that tradition.
()ne walked about, shouting. "Are there
any freshmen girls?" Oiheis ap
pro. k bed females itidi\ idualh and
asked loi llieii permission. Main girls
said no and laughed. Mosi (»l ilieni were
not even appt o.n bed.
Around 12: 15 a.m.. I spoke to a cou
ple female students and asked ilieni il
am one had kissed I hem. I lie ( hivaltous
men ol Stanford had 15 minutes lo seek
out these Iwo females. Yet, lhc\ had not
been kissed. A third woman carried a
lour-foot bv (wo-l'oot sign thai read, "li s
un birthdav! kiss Me!" She moved
through lhe crowd. 1 didn't see her gel a
single kiss.
