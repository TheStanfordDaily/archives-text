Stop the hatred? Tell that to the terrorists.
\\ I it'll I ret in net I to campus on Mon
ti. i\ morning. I noticed tlialk win 11114
st altered ,u ross llit* pavement ot White
I'l.i/a. I In* is 1 ol 1 In* chalk messages was
'Yes to peate, 110 to racism, intolerance
.iikl hatred."
What trouhlfs tut* about these chalk
signs is not tin* it 1\ llii message it sell', hut
rather 11 it* audience to whom it is directed.
I liavf a strong suspicion that tliest* nuv
sagfs art* not iutfndftl lor bin Laden antl
his terrorist minions, but lor tlif S3 percfiit
ol Americans who support the war the
I nitetl States is waging in Afghanistan. In
the mind ol the peace movement, support
lor inilitan action against terrorism seems
inextrieabh linked with I'.S. "intolerance,
rat ism and hatred. Recall the ralh < haul,
"One-two-three-lour. I don't want vour
racist war!"
I he truth is that this war has nothing to
do with I S. "intolerance, racism and ha
tred." Ii has everything to do with the "in
tolerance, racism and hatred" of the ter
rorists we are lighting — hatred so strong
and virulent that it leads people to commit
the at rot it its we saw on Sept. 1 I. ()l t oursc.
we in the I S. have plenty of homegrown
higotrv antl hatred, as the deplorable at
tacks 011 Muslim ,ind Arab Americans
demonstrate, and there is a continuing
need to speak out against the perpetrators
ol these crimes.
But here, our government, our reli
gious organizations and ordinary Ameri
cans condemn the idiots who do these
things. 111 the world of terrorists, hatred is
institutional. I here is little societal con

demnation ol an 11 it 11\ ulu.il who vows, loi
example, to kill all |ews and Americans, lo
the com rat \. this i\pc ol "halt* spccch" is
lrc(|ucntl\ encouraged In religious leaders
and public ollit ials alike.
\n obvious response to ni\ discomlort
with diet lialk slogans is. "It would be lool
isli to direct these messages ol peace and
human understanding to terrorists. I he\
won't licai them, antl if tliev do, tlu*\ ccr
tainh won't listen."
Kxaclh. \nd that's pretiseh win mil
lions ol tolerant, decent Vmericans sup
port this war.

Arab anger is not the result of U.S.,
Israeli policies
Mv commendations to SB. Mcnahem
and Davitl (>al 011 their elot|Ufntl) cogfiit
refutations ol llisior) Prof. |oel lieinin's
"Reasons lor Hate." I lie main problem
with ihf apologists' party line is that it is
happily spewed forth with a completf
disregard lor fact or reason.
Kxtrcniist Arab hatred for Western
(ivili/ation stems from decades of vicious
mis-education and intlot trination, antl
I'rtini a self-righteous, xenophobic dogma
amongst a minute, but ultra-empowered,
minority of Muslims that states that all
non-lslamit ideologies are evil. I he sug
gestion thai Arab anger is the result of
U.S. policy is ludicrous. 1 would like lo
address in detail a few ol the particularly
glaring flaws in the argument.
Bcinin's main assertion semis to be

1 hill ilit* mass murder of Sept. I I was the
result <>l Israeli "aggression" in lighting
the recent Palestinian uprising. As Mena
hem noted, .ill reports slum that Osama
bin Laden's operation required years ol
planning, meaning the plot was hatched
lar before Palestinian leader Nasser
Aral.it rejected the Israeli proposal at
(lamp David. but even if one conve
niently ignores this timeline trille. one
must siill note that .11 Qaeda w.is lorined
primarily as an anti-American group. Its
platloi m, unlike that ol I lamas or the Is
lamic Jihad, is centered around remov
ing the Amerii an militray present e Irom
Saudi Arabia.
lor the s.ike ol argument, though, let
us now assume that Al Q.ieda — magical
ly transformed into .1 pro-Palestinian
group — planned the entire colossus ter
rorist operation in the past six months
purely as a reprisal lor American support
ol Israeli sell-defense, beinin claims that
this great anger was "exacerbated by Is
rael's disproportionate use of force," the
bombing ol t ivilian targets" and the nu
merous "extra-judicial assassinations."
He forgets to mention that in the past
three months, Israeli casualties have
been nearly equal to Palestinian casual
ties, and that while Israel exclusively tar
gets terrorist masterminds and bomb
makers, the Palestinians specifically tar
get civilians. As for the extra-judicial as
pect ol Israel's self-defense, I do not re
member any trial given to the men,
women and children in the Sbarro pizze
ria, the Dolphinarium discotheque or the
