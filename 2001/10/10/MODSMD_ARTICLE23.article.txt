minority of Muslims that states that all
non-lslamit ideologies are evil. I he sug
gestion thai Arab anger is the result of
U.S. policy is ludicrous. 1 would like lo
address in detail a few ol the particularly
glaring flaws in the argument.
Bcinin's main assertion semis to be

1 hill ilit* mass murder of Sept. I I was the
result <>l Israeli "aggression" in lighting
the recent Palestinian uprising. As Mena
hem noted, .ill reports slum that Osama
bin Laden's operation required years ol
planning, meaning the plot was hatched
lar before Palestinian leader Nasser
Aral.it rejected the Israeli proposal at
(lamp David. but even if one conve
niently ignores this timeline trille. one
must siill note that .11 Qaeda w.is lorined
primarily as an anti-American group. Its
platloi m, unlike that ol I lamas or the Is
lamic Jihad, is centered around remov
ing the Amerii an militray present e Irom
Saudi Arabia.
lor the s.ike ol argument, though, let
us now assume that Al Q.ieda — magical
ly transformed into .1 pro-Palestinian
group — planned the entire colossus ter
rorist operation in the past six months
purely as a reprisal lor American support
ol Israeli sell-defense, beinin claims that
this great anger was "exacerbated by Is
rael's disproportionate use of force," the
bombing ol t ivilian targets" and the nu
merous "extra-judicial assassinations."
He forgets to mention that in the past
three months, Israeli casualties have
been nearly equal to Palestinian casual
ties, and that while Israel exclusively tar
gets terrorist masterminds and bomb
makers, the Palestinians specifically tar
get civilians. As for the extra-judicial as
pect ol Israel's self-defense, I do not re
member any trial given to the men,
women and children in the Sbarro pizze
ria, the Dolphinarium discotheque or the
World Trade Center.
Another source of this anger, the article
claims, is Israel's 34-year occupation of the
West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Kast
Jerusalem. Nevermind that Arafat rejected
an oiler last year that would have bloodless
ly ended that occupation. Also, let us not for
get that before the Six Day War, most of
these territories were occupied In Jordan.
I heJordanian government was brutal in its
occupation ol t he West Bank and its repres
sion of the Palestinian people, but the anger
of the Arab street was never aroused against
the I lashemite Kingdom, nor did bombs go
of! in Amman.
America's and Israel's spurning ol the
United Nations is also an impetus for ha
tred, according to Beinin's argument. It is
important to note that it was the Arabs, not
the Israelis, who destroyed the original
I.N. resolution creating two equal states in
the British mandate of Palestine. Beyond
this point, however. I have reservations re
garding the supposed absolute benevo
lence of the United Nations. In the 19 ( .W
"peacekeeping" operation in Somalia,

U.N. troops massacred more than 100
civilians with helicopters and anti-tank
missiles. In light of its own ac tions, I think
the United Nations' assertion th.it Israel
uses "excessive force" is hypocritical.
I am tickled by Beinin's reflexive refer
ence to the Sabra and Shatila massacres. As
is typical to the c lassie blatantly anti-Israel
rhetoric, he forgets to note that the killings
were in fact carried out In I .ebanese oppo
sition groups and that any evidence of Is
raeli involvement — direct or indirect —
has yet to be shown in a court of law.
One final note: the article states that
"Americans who travel to the Arab or Mus
lim world are usuallv welcomed and treat
ed with great generosity." I find this asser
tion odd in light ol the fact that, while peo
ple of all laitlis are allowed in the holy sites
of Jerusalem, or in the Vatic an, non-Mus
lim infidels are baited from entering
Mecca or Medina.
I atn saddened In the self-hatred and
defeatism displaved in the Oct. 8 article. I
urge readers to look past the rhetoric to
the simple I.ids. all ol which point to the
«leai ( one lusion th.it Arab hatred of Amer
ic a and Israel is not rational and cannot be
justified.

Uist week, 1 was at Stanford interview
ing fora job. The day following my inter
view 1 visited Green Library, the Hook
store, the post office and a cafe. Sometime
that morning, 1 misplaced my shoulder
bag containing my airline ticket, credit
cards, cash and photo identification. I re
traced my steps to no avail.
With no cash for even a phone call, I
had to ask to use campus phones to call
my hotel, lost and found, security and the
Marguerite office. At each point, I was
given as much assistance as possible.
The story has a happy ending. When I
reached the Marguerite office they told me
a bus driver named 1 .upe had retrieved my
bag from a bus stop bench and turned it in
at the Marguerite office. I want to thank
Lupe, the Bookstore, a Green Library stu
dent worker, named Ac belle, the Green Li
brary stall'and everyone who went out of
their way that day to assist me. Ihankyou
all. Since so many of you were involved and

ing the Amerii an militray present e Irom
Saudi Arabia.
lor the s.ike ol argument, though, let
us now assume that Al Q.ieda — magical
ly transformed into .1 pro-Palestinian
group — planned the entire colossus ter
rorist operation in the past six months
purely as a reprisal lor American support
ol Israeli sell-defense, beinin claims that
this great anger was "exacerbated by Is
rael's disproportionate use of force," the
bombing ol t ivilian targets" and the nu
merous "extra-judicial assassinations."
He forgets to mention that in the past
three months, Israeli casualties have
been nearly equal to Palestinian casual
ties, and that while Israel exclusively tar
gets terrorist masterminds and bomb
makers, the Palestinians specifically tar
get civilians. As for the extra-judicial as
pect ol Israel's self-defense, I do not re
member any trial given to the men,
women and children in the Sbarro pizze
ria, the Dolphinarium discotheque or the
World Trade Center.
Another source of this anger, the article
claims, is Israel's 34-year occupation of the
West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Kast
Jerusalem. Nevermind that Arafat rejected
an oiler last year that would have bloodless
ly ended that occupation. Also, let us not for
get that before the Six Day War, most of
these territories were occupied In Jordan.
I heJordanian government was brutal in its
occupation ol t he West Bank and its repres
sion of the Palestinian people, but the anger
of the Arab street was never aroused against
the I lashemite Kingdom, nor did bombs go
of! in Amman.
America's and Israel's spurning ol the
United Nations is also an impetus for ha
tred, according to Beinin's argument. It is
important to note that it was the Arabs, not
the Israelis, who destroyed the original
I.N. resolution creating two equal states in
the British mandate of Palestine. Beyond
this point, however. I have reservations re
garding the supposed absolute benevo
lence of the United Nations. In the 19 ( .W
"peacekeeping" operation in Somalia,

U.N. troops massacred more than 100
civilians with helicopters and anti-tank
missiles. In light of its own ac tions, I think
the United Nations' assertion th.it Israel
uses "excessive force" is hypocritical.
I am tickled by Beinin's reflexive refer
ence to the Sabra and Shatila massacres. As
is typical to the c lassie blatantly anti-Israel
rhetoric, he forgets to note that the killings
were in fact carried out In I .ebanese oppo
sition groups and that any evidence of Is
raeli involvement — direct or indirect —
has yet to be shown in a court of law.
One final note: the article states that
"Americans who travel to the Arab or Mus
lim world are usuallv welcomed and treat
ed with great generosity." I find this asser
tion odd in light ol the fact that, while peo
ple of all laitlis are allowed in the holy sites
of Jerusalem, or in the Vatic an, non-Mus
lim infidels are baited from entering
Mecca or Medina.
I atn saddened In the self-hatred and
