## Surprise! Nutrition affects performance 
### JOHN SHAPIRO 
In recent years, the popularity of lad diets
has soared. Anyone who has tuned into late
night 1 Y can attest to the bombardment of ad
vertisements for dietarv supplements, natural
herbs and diet drugs that promise to increase
muscle mass and cut fat. However, few, if any,
actually deliver the promised results.
Another similarlx hyped area is sports nutrition.
Again, companies Hood the market with s| m»iis
drinks, [xiwerbars, protein shakes and even other
imaginable combination of protein and carbohv
dnites packaged in xastlx xaried forms.
It is ol course reasonable to assume that nu
trition plays an important role for peak perfor
mance in athletics. I'artic ularlx pertinent is how
the Stanford varsitx athletic teams incorporate
nutrition into their daily schedules. However,
what they have to sav applies not onl\ to top
tier athletes — it can also applv to anvone who
goes out jogging 01 hits the gun.
In general, the attitude of most coaches and
plaxers is quite relaxed as tliex work together to ton
tinue the Stanford I radition of athletic ac hieveinent.
Wording to Frankie Brennan, assistant coat li
for women's tennis, "Oui top six in the rotation
were ranked one through 10 in the I nder-IS in
high school, and the\ wouldn't Ix 1 there unless
the) ate healthx. so we leave it up to the girls."
What the\ do recommend is eating accord
ing to the basic sol a good diet. Brennan believes
that nutritional innovation has reached a certain
level, and most athletes know what thev need to
eat. (loaches work individual!) with the girls
that need special attention. Not sin prisingh. the
most common problem is dehydration.

more hours a day. 111 addition, thev require
more calories to power their bodies.

and men's basketball are more strut tuted.
Senior Shellx Ripple, captain of the women's
swimming team, recounted the following
guidelines given to sw inunei s: they are to eat a

replacing them with complex carbohvdrates
and avoid saturated lats. I hough thev tr\ toeat

Ripple commented that eating disorders are
a concern, especiall) for female athletes.
Don Chu, newly-hired head trainer for the
entire athletic department, said he believes that
eating disorders are the biggest problem for le
