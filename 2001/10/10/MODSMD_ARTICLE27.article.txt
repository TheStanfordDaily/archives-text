Superconductors: today's hot topic. Super
conductors, \vlii( li exhibit ;i number of valuable
magnetic elici ts, have the potential to be used in
devices as varied a> bullet trains and telephone
wires. According to st ientists, one ol the biggest

challenges in modern phvsics is to product
superconductors that can operate at tem
peratures much closer to room tempera
ture. I'll us far, the warmest temperatures
at which semiconductors have been pro- I
duced is a chilK -109 degrees Celsius. St i
entists at Cornell I nivcrsit\ published a

paper in earh August that pretlicted fluoroa
gents, materials that contain fluorine and silver

would flint lion better as agents for the creation
of semit onductois at wanner temperatures. Re
seat (hers have alread\ begun trying to produce
these compounds, but, unfortunately, they have
proved highly unstable. II successful, it would be

the first time in scientific history that a theory
has preceded the discovery of a high-tempera
ture material.
Do you know that annoying noise your car
produces while driving on the highway? St i
cntists at Purdue University in Indiana may
have found a solution for your vehicle's rattle
and-hum. 1 he researchers have designed a
mathematical model that indicates which re
gions of the tires vibrate the most. From the
tires' sound profile, scientists would be able to
determine the noisiest areas and build better
tires. Currently these budding civil engineers
are working on a more accurate three-dimen
sional model, and they presented their findings
at a conference in I he I lague, Netherlands, in
late August.
If you know anything about ecology, you
know that the ozone layer and carbon fluoro
earbons don't go together. Now another ( lass
of compounds looms as a new environmental
menace: perfluorooctanyl sulfonates, or PFOs.
Resulting from the breakdown of other fluoro
chemicals, the compound was recently detect-

Ed in areas far away from its source. What's the
big IM C) problem? For one, I'FOs are toxic to
plants and animals and live longer than almost
.ill other environmental toxins. Spurred by
alarming reports,

would discontinue I'K) production completely
In 2002. I lie discovery has brought other fluo
rocarbons under greater scrutiny, and agent it's
worldwide are now assessing the problem.
Stanford myth #45: Stern fries have a lot
of salt in them. Well, it you have the i ight ge
netic composition, this might be luu in less. Re
cent studies have found a strong correlation
between genes and salt intake. 1'esting on
rats, scientists found that some did not devel
op hypertension, regardless of salt intake.
Others, however, developed acute high
blood pressure with very small salt quantities.
I'ests on humans have not yet been conclusive
on the link. Until proven otherwise - genes or
no genes - you would be best to watch your
salt intake.
An ambitious plan to drill through Lake
Vostok in Antarctica has slowed to a crawl. ()f
all the great lakes in the world, only one remains
untouched by humans. The reason? It is buried
under four kilometers of ice in one of the most
remote parts of the continent. Why would sci
entists want to explore such a pristine part of na
ture in the first place? Vostok's ice covering is a

geologic time capsule, and the lake itsell tna\

A new generation of optical

interferometers is allowing scien

tists to study stars in 100 times finer

detail than the Hubble Telescope. lutcilci

ometn works In combining two nearl\ identical
signals lo produce interfcrencc and thus obtain
information that is unavailable from a signal
alone. Despite producing sharp resolution, the
technique has its drawbacks. Producing the
right minors is expensive and the sensitivit\ is
extremely low. I hat means the largest inlerfct -

in (California, can make out a stat well, but onl\

posed solutions including bcttei stellar maps
and space-borne platforms.
Quantum computers have sparked one of
the biggest controversies in modern computer
science. Such a machine would be built upon
the principles of quantum physic sand, in theo
ry, would be able to perform unimaginable < al
culations. Researchers at the Max Planck Insti
tute in German) have proposed that using mi
crochips controlling hovering atoms might be
the first step toward creating such machines.
These scientists have used lithographic wires to
produce magnetic tiles to trap and guide atoms
a few microns above the chip surface. I hev have
predicted five years of studies to ascertain
whether it is just another interesting physical el
led or indeed the beginning of a revolution.
