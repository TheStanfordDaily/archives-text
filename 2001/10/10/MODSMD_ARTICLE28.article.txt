Good news for Sega owners:
users of the Dreamcast gaming
console will now be able to surf
Web sites and play games that
use the widespread Java pro
gramming language. Plan
et web, the developer of the In
ternet browser lor the Dream
cast console, recently released a
version of its browser with built
in Java support. The browser
also enables gamers to use a
Java-based instant messaging
client and personalized portal
software built into the upgraded
browser. The software can be
purchased on Amazon.com for
about $15.

NVidia is upgrading its
GeForce3 and GeForce2
graphics processing units by
unveiling the titanium series
for release in mid-October. The
series, NVidia's fastest yet, uses
new shadow techniques to en
hance realism. The new Titani
um series includes three levels
of chips. I'he highest-end
GeForced li 500 boards will
feature a 240 MHz core clock
speed, will have 64M8 of DDR
SDRAM memory and will be
capable of 9(H) billion opera
tions per second. These boards
will sell for around $389. The
lower end GeForceSTi 200 and
GeForce'- 1 i boards target the
mainstream market.
University of Oxford re
searchers have pinpointed a ge
net u mutation that seems to be

responsible fora rare speech
and language disorder. Those
with the inherited disorder
have trouble moving their
mouth and tongue, identifying
the sounds that make up words
and understanding sentences
and rules of grammar — even
though some of them possess
normal intelligence. Re
searchers believe that the loss of
functioning protein, from one
copy of the affected gene - called
FOXP2 - and other genes in its
class, to another may disrupt
the proper growth of key
speech and language structures
in the brain.

The Stratospheric Observa
tory for Infrared Astronomy
(nicknamed "Sofia") is set to
overtake the Hubble Space
Telescope as the biggest tele
scope to leave Earth. Sofia con
sists of a 2.5-meter telescope
mounted in a modified Boeing
747. Although the plane will
never travel into space, the
plane's cruising altitude will put
the scope above more than 99
percent of the infrared-absorb
ing water vapor in Earth's at
mosphere. This system will en
able the Sofia easily to see stars
and proto-stars, as well as inves
tigate the composition of comets
and planetary atmospheres.
The first true science flights are
scheduled for the fourth quar
ter 0f2002.
