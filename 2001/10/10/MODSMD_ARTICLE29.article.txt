WEATHER AND THE
ANASAZI: Universitj <>l
New Mexico scientists Victor
I'olvak and Ymane Asmerom
report that changes in rain
fall propelled significant cul
tuial shilts in ancient Anasazi
society.

I lie researchers procured
five stalagmites from the Carls
bad (lavei ns and 11 idden (lave
in the Cuadalupe Mountains
ol New Mexico. Stalagmites are
columns growing up from the
ground that are composed of
minerals deposited by drip
ping water â€” thus their struc
ture oilers insight into rainfall
patterns. I sing the mineral
bands of the stalagmites, the
scientists were able to follow
precipitation changes in the
area year In year over the past
4,000 years.
I he Anasa/i, ancestors of
the modern day I'ueblo Native
Americans, moved toward set
tlement and agriculture from
a nomadic, hunter-gatherer
paradigm between 2000 B.C.
and 1000 B.C. According to

the researchers, this correlates
with the coming of a wetter cli
mate to the area. In 300 A.1).,
ceramics began their replace
ment of baskets and cotton was
first grown, coinciding with
the start of a drier period in
history.
Rainfall changes are also be
lieved to have influenced the
move around 1000 A.I), to
multi-story, multi-room pueb
los at high elevation and the
later move in about 1330 A.I),
down to the rivers.
A LANGUAGE GENE:
British geneticists report in the
journal Nature that they have
made the first ever identifica
tion of a language gene. The
FOXI'2 gene could offer the
answer to why some people
have speech impairments.
Simon Fisher, of the Wellcome
Trust Center for Human Ge
netics in Oxford, and Anthony
Monaco and Faraneh Vargha-
Khadem, of the Institute of
Child Health in London,
headed a team in analyzing
three generations of a family
with a history of speech prob
lems. Their findings could
offer clues to how language
evolved and how speech devel
ops in humans. It is suspected
that many language impair
ments may be caused by unde
veloped speech and language

tenters in the brain, due to ge
netic irregularities.
FARM EXPOSURE KEEPS
AWAY ALLERGIES: Doctors
have known thai children grow
ing up on lai ins are less likel\ to
suffei from asthma and allergies.
A new stud\ headed bv Dr. |osef
Kiccllei ol ('.liilchen's Hospital in

Sal/burg, Austria, sheds light on
when exposure to the farm oilers
the most protection. I he re
searchers collected information
on the milk consumption, expo
sure to animal stables and asth
ma and allergies of over 800 chil
dren between the ages six and I 3
in rural Austria, (lertnam and
Switzerland. Blood samples were
also collec ted to ( he< k for c ertain
antibody levels. 319 of the chil
dren were from farming families,
while 193 were from non-farm
ing households. I he researc hei s

lound that asthma and hay fever
svmptoms were much lower in
farm c hilclren than in non-farm
children. I'hose who had expo
sure to alarm environment he
lore the age of one had greater
protection against allergies than
those who were exposed between
the ages of one and live. Long
term exposure 1 to animal stables
correlated with the lowest occur
rences of astluna and allergies
among the sample. Ihe re
searc hei s reported then findings
in I lie I.ancet.
