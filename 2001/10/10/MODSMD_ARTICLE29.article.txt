WEATHER AND THE
ANASAZI: Universitj <>l
New Mexico scientists Victor
I'olvak and Ymane Asmerom
report that changes in rain
fall propelled significant cul
tuial shilts in ancient Anasazi
society.

I lie researchers procured
five stalagmites from the Carls
bad (lavei ns and 11 idden (lave
in the Cuadalupe Mountains
ol New Mexico. Stalagmites are
columns growing up from the
ground that are composed of
minerals deposited by drip
ping water â€” thus their struc
ture oilers insight into rainfall
patterns. I sing the mineral
bands of the stalagmites, the
scientists were able to follow
precipitation changes in the
area year In year over the past
4,000 years.
I he Anasa/i, ancestors of
the modern day I'ueblo Native
Americans, moved toward set
tlement and agriculture from
a nomadic, hunter-gatherer
paradigm between 2000 B.C.
and 1000 B.C. According to

the researchers, this correlates
with the coming of a wetter cli
mate to the area. In 300 A.1).,
ceramics began their replace
ment of baskets and cotton was
first grown, coinciding with
the start of a drier period in
history.
Rainfall changes are also be
lieved to have influenced the
move around 1000 A.I), to
multi-story, multi-room pueb
los at high elevation and the
later move in about 1330 A.I),
down to the rivers.
A LANGUAGE GENE:
British geneticists report in the
journal Nature that they have
made the first ever identifica
tion of a language gene. The
FOXI'2 gene could offer the
answer to why some people
have speech impairments.
Simon Fisher, of the Wellcome
Trust Center for Human Ge
netics in Oxford, and Anthony
Monaco and Faraneh Vargha-
Khadem, of the Institute of
Child Health in London,
headed a team in analyzing
three generations of a family
with a history of speech prob
lems. Their findings could
offer clues to how language
evolved and how speech devel
ops in humans. It is suspected
that many language impair
ments may be caused by unde
veloped speech and language
