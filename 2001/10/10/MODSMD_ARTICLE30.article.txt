# Pop Rocks, anyone?
## The
						Answer girl 
### JEN TAYLOR 
Q: Last weekend I was hanging out with my
friends. We were partying pretty hard and getting
kind of silly. By the end of the night, one of my
drawmates dared me to pour a paeket of Pop
Rocks into my mouth and wash it down with a
whole can of soda. For some reason, I just kept
thinking of something my older sister used to tell
me when we were kids, and I had to say no way.

Answer Girl, is it true
that if I had gone
through with it, my
stomach would have
exploded?
A: Whoa! It
sounds to me like
you've heard the
urban legend about
Mi key the 111 I. Ce
real kid one too
main times. I le was
rumored to have suf
fered death l>\ Pop
Rot ks in the I 98()s.
Regardless, that's all
just a myth. Let me
try to explain how
Pop Roc ks work and
what's ac tually going
on here.
For all of you who
don't know, Pop
Rocks are candy that

look like ;i hunch oft olorful pehhles. When you
put them in your mouth, they pop, fizzle and
si/./le in what seems like a series of little explo
sions. Pop Rocks were invented in 1975 for
General Foods by scientist William A Mitchell.
He arrived at the final product by injecting car
bon dioxide into a melted, flavored (mmm . . .
my favorite is strawberry) sugar mixture under
pressure. l he carbonation be
comes trapped inside the sugar crystals when
the mixture is tooled rapidly. All the action
takes place when you pop a handful of the

candy into
your mouth.
nr I

The gas
pockets inside the crystals expand when com
bined with the temperature and moisture of
your mouth. The gas breaks through the candy
walls, which causes the mini-explosion.
It's understandable that you'd want to be a lit
tle cautious about this incredible phenomenon.
The public has been skeptic fora long while. In

1979, amidst rumors
and growing con
corns, the Food and
Drug Administration
set u| > a telephone
hotline in Seattle to
answer questions
and allay (ears, even
though they had test
ed the product and
deemed it safe. Gen
eral Mills even went
so l.u as to take out
lull-page ads in 45
major publications
and wiote about
50.000 letters to
school principals to
convince the public
(Ikii Pop Rocks are,
indeed, harmless.
Kven as recently as
|iilv of this yeai. two
parents sued Baskin-

Rohbins after their live-year-old daughter swal
lowed Pop Rocks unknowingly from the "Shrek
Swirl" flavored icecream.
All of this may seem a hit over the lop when
one learns that Pop Rocks contain about as
much carbon dioxide as half a can of soda.
Granted, when you combine one packct with
one can of soda, the carbon dioxide from the
soda itself adds a little exti .1 get-up-and-go, hut
the worst that can happen to you is letting go of
a pretty nasty bel< h in front of all >0111 friends.
You'll be the life of the party!
