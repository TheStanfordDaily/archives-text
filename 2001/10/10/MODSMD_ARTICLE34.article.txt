# Defense left out yet again
## 
### 
Witli 2:01 remaining in this past Sat
urday's showdown between No. 3
Oklahoma and No. f> Texas, l.ong
liorn quarterback Chris Siinms
strode to the line of scrimmage, poised to take
bis team on a 97-yard game-winning touch
down drive. However, something suddenh
happened that knocked the I leisman candidate
«uul Golden Boy of college football oil bis

pedestal, and that thing was
()klahoma safety Roy Williams.
It was the single best play, col
lege or professional, that I have
seen in a long while.
For those of you not lucky
enough to have seen this amaz
ing play (and game as a whole),
I will quickly trv to convey just
what happened. With the score
7-3 in favor of Oklahoma,

Texas regained possession of the football at
their own 3-yard line, with a chance for one
game-saving drive.
This is the situation all quarterbacks dream of
— the two-minute drill, the long touchdown
drive fora comeback vic tory a la John Elway. ()n
national television, this was the perfect opportu
nity for Siinms to finally show his true mettle and
prove all thee lit its, who claim he's overrated and
over-hyped, wrong. Needless to say, Siinms did
not have much time to state his case.
Sensing the possibility of a big defensive play,
Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops called a blitz on
first down, sending All-American strong safety
Roy Williams from the left side of the line. Right
as the ball was snapped, Williams rushed
through the line and was met by a Texas blocker,
just as Siinms was cocking back, ready to unload
to bis wide receiver on the right side of the field.
Somehow, however, with Bobby Boucher
like grace, the six-foot Williams leapt over the
bloc k, c rushing Sinuns while still in the air. I his
bone-jarring hit popped the ball right out of
Siinms' hands into the waiting arms of Sooner
linebacker Tedd) Lehman, who walked into the
end/one fora two-yard interception return for
a touchdown.
For all of you sports fans that have yet to see
this play, I am sorry for not doing the play justice
and I feel for you because this was by far the best
play I have seen (and probably will see) all season.
Given the time remaining, the score of the game
and the importance of the game itself, I could not
imagine a bigger play. These two teams meet
every year in what is both teams' most highly an
ticipated game, this year being the first time since
1084 that both teams were in the top-five, mak
ing the play even that much greater.
What tops it off is the fact that this play was just

liorn quarterback Chris Siinms
strode to the line of scrimmage, poised to take
bis team on a 97-yard game-winning touch
down drive. However, something suddenh
happened that knocked the I leisman candidate
«uul Golden Boy of college football oil bis

pedestal, and that thing was
()klahoma safety Roy Williams.
It was the single best play, col
lege or professional, that I have
seen in a long while.
For those of you not lucky
enough to have seen this amaz
ing play (and game as a whole),
I will quickly trv to convey just
what happened. With the score
7-3 in favor of Oklahoma,

Texas regained possession of the football at
their own 3-yard line, with a chance for one
game-saving drive.
This is the situation all quarterbacks dream of
— the two-minute drill, the long touchdown
drive fora comeback vic tory a la John Elway. ()n
national television, this was the perfect opportu
nity for Siinms to finally show his true mettle and
prove all thee lit its, who claim he's overrated and
over-hyped, wrong. Needless to say, Siinms did
not have much time to state his case.
Sensing the possibility of a big defensive play,
Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops called a blitz on
first down, sending All-American strong safety
Roy Williams from the left side of the line. Right
as the ball was snapped, Williams rushed
through the line and was met by a Texas blocker,
just as Siinms was cocking back, ready to unload
to bis wide receiver on the right side of the field.
Somehow, however, with Bobby Boucher
like grace, the six-foot Williams leapt over the
bloc k, c rushing Sinuns while still in the air. I his
bone-jarring hit popped the ball right out of
Siinms' hands into the waiting arms of Sooner
linebacker Tedd) Lehman, who walked into the
end/one fora two-yard interception return for
a touchdown.
For all of you sports fans that have yet to see
this play, I am sorry for not doing the play justice
and I feel for you because this was by far the best
play I have seen (and probably will see) all season.
Given the time remaining, the score of the game
and the importance of the game itself, I could not
imagine a bigger play. These two teams meet
every year in what is both teams' most highly an
ticipated game, this year being the first time since
1084 that both teams were in the top-five, mak
ing the play even that much greater.
What tops it off is the fact that this play was just
