### JACOB SAPERSTEIN 
After the sixth week of the season, the Pa
cific 1 () (lonferencefrnthall rat e has separat

four of which arc nationally tanked. In the
upper echelon, No. 3 (>regon (5-0, IV-0 I'ac
-10), No. 7 UCLA (4-0,1-0) and No. 8 Wash
ington (4-0,2-0) are all in the quest lot a New

and Washington State (5-0, !t-0) are also un
defeated in conference, hut have yet to
prove themselves against high-calil)er oppo
nents. I lie other five teams in the l'ac-10
have yet to win a conference game, although
Oregon State (1-3, 0-2) and Southern ( ali
fornia (1-4, 0-3) have played Ixrtter than
their records indicate and still have aspira
tions of making a howl game
With Stanford, I ( l .\andCaKfovnia((K
4,0-2) having had last weekend off, this
weekend offers the season's first full slate of
Pac-10 matt hups..
In last weekend's most exciting game,
