# Researchers examine threat of bioterrorism

### RAVNEET KAUR 
Following I he terrorist attacks
of Sept. I I, several government
agencies, private institutions and
corporations have focused their
attention on other possibilities ol
terrorist action in America.
Mam experts agree that bioter
rorism is a highly significant
threat to the public.
In response to this heightened
aw are n ess. ( longressionally
fu titled institutions and private
restart hers — including many .it
Stanford — are directing in
creased effort and resources to
ward studying the ramifications
of a bioterrorist attack.
I he I Diversity has long

ism researt h. Researt hers at the
(lentei for International Seni
lity and (100 pel-at ion and at
various departments are devel
oping methods to address the
threat in the most appropriate
way possible.
bioterrorist action entails dis
persing biological weapons such
.is anthrax, botulism, bubonic
plague, Kbola virus, smallpox
.iikl other such contagious
agents within the population,
with the intent of causing wide
spread sit kness and death.
In 1993, the Japanese terror
ist group Aum Shinrikyo
sprayed anthrax bacteria re
sponsible fora disease known as
anthrax inhalation in subways in
central I okyo, killing 12 and in
juring 5,500.
According to Christopher
(llivba, co-director of CISAC,
thisattack demonstrated that "at
tempted mass urban bioterrorist
at tat ks are no longer in the realm
of the fantastic.
"However, the Aum did not
succeed with biological weapons
because they were unable to
overcome certain technical hur
dles," Clhyba added. "This sug
gests that a large-st ale bioterror
ist attat k is not an easy undertak
ing. but we must be prepared."
Kxnerts believe a severe con

sequence of a bioterrorist act
would be a massive influx of'tht
injured to medical facilities

of dealing with the illnesses asso
ciated with bioterrorism.
According to Laura Donohuc,
a (1ISA( 1 post dot toral fellow , the
aim t)f'terrorism is to produce a
reaction in the targeted nation.
Donohuc said bioterrorism is
fundamentallv different from
war — thus the national re
sponse must also be different.
"Krodingt ivil liberties is an in
effective wav to respond. We
need to in fad maintain t i\ il lib
erties." she said.
" Flie United States lias a ven

the [Sept. 111 attat k <»n the na
tion was devastating and horri
ble, it can't take away our t i\ il lib
erties."
Donohuc w ill be giving a lec
ture course this spring on the
lopit of terrorism, counter-ter
rorism and t ivil liberties.
Kxperts sav most biological
weapons are intended to initiate
epidemics that have not been
previously treated In medical
stall. Should sut li an attack occur,
diagnosis and treatment are like
ly to be delayed; therefore, ac
cording to ( hyba, many re
seart hers coin entrate on recog
nizing and responding to an at
tack rather than preventing tine.
"We need to improve disease
surveillance, as well as our ability
to respond to an outbreak with
vaccines, antibacterials or atitivi
rals," (Ihyba said.
"This is not prevention, but it
will allow us to recogni/e and re
spond to an attack as effectively
as possible, lie said.

Only in recent years have gov
ernment ollicials begun to reali/e
the magnitude ol the threat posed
by biological attacks, as a HMMi
statement from Dr. Cordon (..
()ehlcr. director of the ( TVs Non
prolileration Center. illustrates.
"Terrorist interest in chemical
and biological weapons is not sur
prising, given the relative ease with
which some of these weapons can
Ik* produced in simple laborato
ries, the large number of casualties
they can cause, and the residual
disruption of infrastructure,"
Oehler said.
"Although popular fiction and
national attention have foc used on
terrorist use of nuc lear weapons,
c hemical and biological weapons
are more likely choices for such
groups," he added.
