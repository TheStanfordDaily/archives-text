Why do we waul (and do) so many things that are bad for us?
Why do we like junk food better than fruit? Why is the road to
romance so rocky? Mean Denes answers these questions and
other fundamental questions about human nature by investigating
the biological nature of temptation and the struggle for control. Short,
sassy and bold, the authors describe the connections
between our genes and our behavior, revealing that struggles for
self-improvement, are in fact, battles against our own genes.
