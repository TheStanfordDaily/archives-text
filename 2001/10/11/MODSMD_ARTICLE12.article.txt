# Marrow drive to benefit minorities
## 
### SHEENA CHESTNUT 
Lambda Phi Epsilon, Stan
ford's Asian-American fraterni
ty, will hold its annual Bone
Marrow fyping Drive today
from 1 1 a.m. to 2 p.m. and to
morrow from 1 1 a.m. to 3 p.m.
iti White Plaza. 1 lit* drive is tar
geted at new students who
haven't yet been typed, and mi
nority students, because few
Asian Americans are registered
potential donors.
Bone marrow transplants re
place diseased bone marrow
with a donor's healthy mat row.
I he healthy marrow produces
\ ital blood components like red
and white blood cells and
platelets. I'hey are used to treat
leukemia, lymphomas .nid
other blood diseases.
Although the best results
occur when donors are related
to the patients, transplants can
also work with matched unre
lated donors.
According to the National
Marrow Donor Program, about
70 percent of patients do not
have .i compatible family donor.
Matt hing a donor to a recipient
is done on the basis oft issue type,
not blood tvpe, which tends to be
more common within certain
ethnic groups.
()nlv 1 6 percent of the Na
tional Registt v at this point rep
resents racial minorities, lower
ing the odds ol finding a suc
cessful donor to around one in
one million for minorities. II no
related donor is found, patients
can be matched to unrelated
donors at a national database
affiliated with the NMD P.
At this week's drive, trained
professionals will draw a blood
sample to determine partici
pants' human leukocyte anti

gen type for entry into the data
base, and will ask them to fill
out paperwork so that they can
be contacted if a match is made.
Ihe process takes approxi
mately I") minutes, and dona
tion after typing is voluntary.
Junior Warren Wu, vice
president of service for 1 .ambda
Phi Kpsilon, explained that the
drive is rooted in the fraterni
ty's past experience with the
need fora marrow donor.
"In 1995, our brother Kvan
Chen was diagnosed with
leukemia. The fraternity, along
with Evan's friends, organized
.i joint effort to find a donor for
Evan," Wu said. "What resulted
was the largest bone marrow
typing drive in the historv <>112
the NMDP and Asian-Ameri
can Donor Program."
Although a match was even
tually found for Evan, he
passed awav in 1996. In his
memory, the fraternity hosts
the annual tvping drive even
