## The
						Stanford Daily Analyzing the stereotype of Stanford apathy 
### 
On Tuesday, British and American
l< >ixes unleashed a third day of air
strikes against military targets and
terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan.
In response, at Broun, over 100 students
walked out of class and gathered in protest. At
l'('.-Berkeley, an anti-wai protest was
mate'lied In a counter-rally supporting U.S.
action, drawing more than 1,000 participants
in total. At Kmorv, a student burned an Amer
ican flag.
At Stanford, though, company represen
tatives gathered in White Plaza for 11 it- an

any American military action. Nevertheless,
the contrast to Stanford's peer schools raises
some questions.
True, students did hold a peace rally in
White Plaza that was matched by a sin.ill
counter-protest supporting the war effort.
But these rallies were ignored In the inajori
tyof students. In general, thereat tion at Stan
ford was on a far smaller scale than at other
universities around the country.
Perhaps this lack of reaction is evidence of
broad student support for the war effort.
Such a stand would be a patriotic and acf
mirableone, but speaking out against the war
would be e<juall\ so.
Terrorism and the appropriate re
sponse to terrorist attacks are the most im
portant issues of out time. ()ur generation

must face these challenges with thought
and c are.
Students at other schools are grappling
with these questions and reacting vigorously.
Such passion is laigelv invisible at Stanford or
seems to exist onlv in small, tightlv-knit stu
dent groups.
Judging from the opinions pages of The
I )aily, it seems that a fair proportion of the stu
dents oppose military action. There are
ample other forums to express the opinions
seen in these pages to the public.
I he stereotype exists that Stanford stu
dents are apathetic. Is this true? Why? Cer
tainh we at Stanford are just as busy as other
students. For some reason, they consider ac
tivism a higher priority than the average
Stanford student does.

The isolation of our campus allows us to
feel that we are removed from the events, but
ignorance is a luxury we cannot afford. We
need to think about why other students are
showing their opinion so strongly while Stan
lord students appear 011 the surface to be
mostly apathetic.
S< >me issiles are simply 11< )t w< >rt h get ting all
riled up about. But terrorism is amazingly im
portant now and in the future. Decisions
made in the days, weeks and months ahead
will stav with us for decides.
We hope that Stanford students' lack of
outward activism does not mean that they do
not care about the recent events and their
consequences. We hope that although they
choose not to display their opinions, their be
liefs are passionate.
