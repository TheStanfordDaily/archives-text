## The
						month of October: baseball's time to shine 
### 
Ah. October, inv favorite
month of llu* ycai. Its so nice
to sec \on again. loi 1 1 long
months. I've been waiting so
anxionsh lor von to arrive, bringing
all the jovs vou hold. The beginning ol
autumn, and the change in weather.
College football, hotiiecoininir,

marching bands. I lal
lovveen. \nd plavofl
baseball.
There's nothing
quite like the whoosh
of a good fastball, the
crack ola bat .is it
sends the ball si ream
ing toward the fence

or the smack of leather on leather as a
fielder makes a catch so amazing that
you break into a rendition of the
SportsCcnter jingle. It's the magic ol
baseball, the national pastime, and
October is the sport's time to shine.
I'm convinced that the 2001 season
has been the best ever, harry Bonds
finished an M\T-worthv season with a
mind-boggling 73 home runs, break
ing the unbreakable record for the sec -
ond time in onl\ three years.
Rickev Henderson moved to the
top ol the all-time runs scored list
and became only the 25th player to
ever rack up 3,000 hits. You can love
these two plavcrs for their obvious
skill or hate them lor their contro
versial personalities, but you can't
deny their achievements.
Roger (lleinens, ancient bv normal
athletic standards .it age 39, pitched
his way to a 20 win, 3 loss record.
Crcg Maddux set a new National
League record when he hurled 72
1/3 innings before issuing a walk —
and the walk that ended the streak
was intentional.
There were no-hitters, grand slams,
emerging stars and the all-important
revival of the bobble-head doll. For the
first time in years, the National
League Last found itself in a true pen
nant race. I lie Americ an League West
was as good as clinched by June, yet
the guys in second place still battled it
out for the wild card.
The Seattle Mariners whe magi
cal as they blitzed through baseball
with 110 wins — tying the all-time
wins record set in 1900 — despite
having lost three players over the
last three years, who are arguably
the best pitcher, center fielder, and

shortstop in the game. I he men who
filled the holes were unknowns in
April, but bv September we were
singing the praises ol manager Lou
Piniella's abilit\ to make nothing
into ;i definite something. We went
ga-ga lorlc hiro Su/uki, who we soon
knew on a first-name basis, as he led
all of baseball in both batting average
and stolen bases.
Amidst the fantastic displays of
physical strength and mental
prowess, there were, as alwavs, mis
fortunes. As Bonds replaced McG
wire's name with his own in the Ilall
of Fame, his Giants were eliminated
from the plavollsand sent homecarlv
for the winter.
I lie Mets, last year s National
I .caguc ( hampions, finalh found their
groove but couldn't escape the clutch
es ol "too little, too late." The Texas
Rangers gained one superstar in Alex
Rodriguez, but failed to make a run at
the postseason. And ves, it seems that
the Red Sox do indeed continue to sill
ier from the Bambino's curse as they
hit a long losing streak in early
September.
But in the end, everything — the
hits and misses alike — has con
verged on this month, on October.
These, my friends, are the finest
weeks in all of sports. We watch to be
entertained, awed and captivated by
the unadulterated human drama. We
tune in to see if the pift her can once
again summon the high heat. We lis
ten in hopes that the batter connects
at just the right moment. Already, we
are being satisfied.
The Atlanta Braves, bolstered bv
the hitting of Chipper Jones and the
pitching of loin (ilavine, have taken a
2-0 lead on the Houston Astros despite
their dubious distinction as the first
team to ever reach the playoffs with a
losing record at home. 1 he Cleveland
Indians erased the initial fears of
naysayers who assumed the A.L.
would be steam rolled by shutting out
the conquering Mariners in the first
game of that series.
And after six months of amazing
baseball, I say this postseason can only
continue to improve. October, I'm so
glad you're here. IMav ball!
