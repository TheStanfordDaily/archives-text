Error in Palo Alto Square theater article
I Icic is a small error that I noticed in
an artii le, "Palo Alto Square set to reopen
as an art film venue," in I uesdav's Daily.
I he article savs: "Klitiksiek staled that
alter the closure of Printer's Inc. hook
store on I Diversity Ave. last year, he
feared that Palo Alio would lose the sort
of cultural institutions that a universit\
town should have." Printer's Inc.
was in fad located on California Ave. in
Palo Alto and on ( astro St.in Mountain
View. I lie Castro St. location was re
placed In a Books liu . and the('.alilornia
Ave. location was closed. Stat e\'s was the
bookstore that recentl\ closed on Uni

Bombing Afghanistan 'will not make
things better'
1 feel like I'm swimming upstream. I
listen to the news and hear that 90 per
cent of people in the I nited States sup
port the bombings in Afghanistan. I low
can this be possible? After reading sev
eral articles and listening to well-edu
cated people on National Public Radio,
I have come to one conclusion: the ma
jority of Americans are not well enough
informed about the consequences of
war.
First of all, it is clear that the events
of Sept. I I were horrible. I cannot
imagine being a fireman climbing the
stairs on the 40th floor when the south
tower of the World Trade ('.enter

began to collapse. I cannot imagine
being trapped on the 108 th floor,
telling m\ loved ones that I love them
moments before my unavoidable
death. I he events were horrible. I his is
without doubt.
What's missing from most people's
knowledge is what t a u set I these attacks
in the first plate. The short answer is
this: when the United States directly or
indirectly kills people, the survivors
grow .i hat i etl for Anient a. 1 his is easy
to understand (now) by simpK looking
.it the amount of hatred in this t ountry.
And that is from a single day of attack,
with casualties in the (mere) thousands.
I .S. bombs and missiles and U.S.-
fundetl Israeli military efforts have
killed thousands upon thousands of
people over the past few decades. And
the military bombings have sociological
repercussions, which we can witness
now with the refugees fleeing
Afghanistan. I here are many people
who have lost their loved ones when
unguided American bombs strike their
cottage, when angry riots burn down
their business because of a poster of an
"American" movie. These are the peo
ple who have a growing hatred of
America.
Bombing Afghanistan fuels this fire.
With every bomb that drops, another
do/en people stand up to say that they
will fight back. Fundamentally, it is the
U.S. foreign polity and military history
which brought the Sept. 1 1 attacks.
C)ur continuing terror in Afghanistan is
only more proof for those against us
that we are the true menace.
I understand the frustration. 1 sympa
thize with the entire western world in our

feeling of helplessness about "how can we
possibh stop terrorism." But I beg you to
consider something: people are only will
ing to (lit- fora cause if they believe that
the cause is more important than their
own lives. These are not "crazy" people.
I hey have made a conscious choice.
I hey have said. "I believe so strongly in
changing this world that 1 am willing to
sacrifice my life for the cause". We should
be questioning the cause.
According to Osama bin Laden, the
cause is the continued military presence
in the Middle East. The cause is the con
tinued fighting in Israel. Some may
argue that the cause is religion, but fun
damentally, it is not religion that is caus
ing the' hatred. There is no religion that
on its own formulates hatred. Religion is
a tool. And it is being used as a tool by
both sides of this war. It can help to gal
vanize a cause, but it is not the cause it
self. 1 his is a very important distinction.
II we want to end the terrorism, let's
first make some efforts to remove the
cause. Perhaps bin Laden has a valid
point. Perhaps the United States should
not have a military presence in Saudi
Arabia. Perhaps Israel should not be
killing Palestinians in their claim of the
holy land. Perhaps dropping bombs will
only make matters worse.
I can say with much confidence that
dropping bombs will not make things
better. I he only result will be that some
things blow up, and some people die.
\\ it h the side effect of the survivors vow
ing to seek revenge. I hope that soon, the
bombs will stop.

who have lost their loved ones when
unguided American bombs strike their
cottage, when angry riots burn down
their business because of a poster of an
"American" movie. These are the peo
ple who have a growing hatred of
America.
Bombing Afghanistan fuels this fire.
With every bomb that drops, another
do/en people stand up to say that they
will fight back. Fundamentally, it is the
U.S. foreign polity and military history
which brought the Sept. 1 1 attacks.
C)ur continuing terror in Afghanistan is
only more proof for those against us
that we are the true menace.
I understand the frustration. 1 sympa
thize with the entire western world in our

feeling of helplessness about "how can we
possibh stop terrorism." But I beg you to
consider something: people are only will
ing to (lit- fora cause if they believe that
the cause is more important than their
own lives. These are not "crazy" people.
I hey have made a conscious choice.
I hey have said. "I believe so strongly in
changing this world that 1 am willing to
sacrifice my life for the cause". We should
be questioning the cause.
According to Osama bin Laden, the
cause is the continued military presence
in the Middle East. The cause is the con
tinued fighting in Israel. Some may
argue that the cause is religion, but fun
damentally, it is not religion that is caus
ing the' hatred. There is no religion that
on its own formulates hatred. Religion is
a tool. And it is being used as a tool by
both sides of this war. It can help to gal
vanize a cause, but it is not the cause it
self. 1 his is a very important distinction.
II we want to end the terrorism, let's
first make some efforts to remove the
cause. Perhaps bin Laden has a valid
point. Perhaps the United States should
not have a military presence in Saudi
Arabia. Perhaps Israel should not be
killing Palestinians in their claim of the
holy land. Perhaps dropping bombs will
only make matters worse.
I can say with much confidence that
dropping bombs will not make things
better. I he only result will be that some
things blow up, and some people die.
\\ it h the side effect of the survivors vow
ing to seek revenge. I hope that soon, the
bombs will stop.
