## A
						call for Americans to love 
### SAMIRA KHAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
Is the definition of justice a blind hunt
foi retribution undei the mask of patrio
tism .md the false hope that this retribu
tion will lead to the diminishing of terror
ism? ()i is n more like a war waged against
innocent, abused and terrorized civilians
In increasing the civil unrest and eco
nomic. social .ind political destruction in
other countries?
Is it punishing starving children,
women and threatened men for the
wrongs of terrorist masterminds and op
pressive government policy? If so, then
America is .it wai with justice, humanity
.md tolerance within the I nited States. In
that case, the terrorists have won the war
against America. I he\ have emerged vic
torious ,n the hands of our psvchological
weakness.
So. we gel bin Laden, but what about
his followers? I his is not a religious war.
Someone who can mastermind such an
attack is not ii rational, but has precise
goals .md politicalh driven ones. Hate
.md anti-American sentiment will not be
c rushed wit 11 bombs.
()u Sept. 11, thousands died at the
hands of e\ il niastei minds. 1 he world, in
(lndini; the Arab countries, felt"grief and
empatln.
Set. the media interniittenth arouses
the public .md sensationalizes the news
with (lips of Palestinians celebrating this
,Ki In doing so, the\ initiate the psycho
logic aland emotional inurdei of Muslims
everywhere, as i heir faces are made to

represent the faces of evil.
The media initiates and ignites racial
tension within the United States while
hiding behind the facade of reporting the
significant news to the public. Ihe\ ac l as
though there was nothing more impor
tant to report than these few emphasized
clips. They help the terrorists with their
divisive aims. Did the resulting harass
ment to Muslims all over the I nited
States and in other countries make the
news in the same way? No.
American media thirsts fora tangible
source to blame. Those meager clips
were all they had at the time. Politicians
feed us notions of solidai it\ as being ke\
to our preservation and our invincibili
ty. Yet at the same time ilicv slaughter
our unity with the possibilit\ of war that
will result in the deaths of mam inno
cent people.
Endangering civilians in other coun
tries, who did not harbor bin l aden, is
causing the deaths of the innocent.
Should they be held responsible lot
their governments' actions and killed In
the decision of a country that represents
liberty and freedom, onlv to have those
who actually did assist him emerge un
scathed?
We do not need to go abroad to have
many innocent Muslims killed for the op
pressive few culprits. 11 at reel in Anieru .t is
America waging a wai against itself, and it
is just the beginning, as it repi esenis ,i ter
rorist victory.
Politicians wish to feed America the sat
isfaction of reti ihutiou, while stealthih ot
unconsciously hiding from the truth and

(lit' root of tlu- problem: anti-American
sentiment possibly due to foreign policy
dec isions. Such dec isions have alreadv in
spired main who will tr\ to emulate bin
Laden. Increasing tension against Mus
lims in general, through harassment and
false media clips, will onlv alienate Amer
ican Muslims who wish to stand in soli
darity and save the I nited States.
Justice is indeed to capture the suspect
and those individuals that have assisted in
this evil.
It is to discover the worldwide network
that exists under our very noses and it is
not to cripple other nations at the hands
of our pressure and thirst for some illu
sionan retribution.
Now is not .i time to let terrorists divert
our attention l>\ causing us to hate one
another or entangle us in futile contem
plations. Ii is a time to prevent the breed
ing of terrorism and this war against hu
manity. Finally, it is time for us to recon
sider our i igidit\ and foreign polio ()ur
overt support of certain countries and
lac k of true neutralit\ is a great force of
self-destruction.
Mv nightmare is that millions pra\ and
menu n at the past at roc ities and those to
come, and that the terrorists rejoice and
use our domestic tension and \ ulnerabili
t\ against us, .is America contemplates
whethei or not to wage .1 war that will de
stroy innocent lives as part of a war
against humanity. I lie terrorists (arc
about no people, not us and not their
o\\ 11. I lere the) are w inningb\ killing the
spirit of souls with fear. In this fear is my
c all to love.
