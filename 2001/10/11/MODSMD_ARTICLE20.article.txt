Former senator Ping Kwan, a
senior, who developed the idea
during his term last year, spoke
about the W'hoßides program at
last week's Senate meeting as

outlined a svstem in which dri
vers and riders could post theii
intended destinations and navel
times online. II the computei

tact information would be sent
out to both parties.

concern of (lie program, accord

W'hoßides Web site would list
safety guidelines and record the
names of the driver and passen

"legallv kosher," explaining that
trips to Krnie's liquor store, foi

"Most vices are going to be out."
he said. "No trips to your weed

"()nce we get the site up and
working, publicit\ will be a
snap, Kwan said.
