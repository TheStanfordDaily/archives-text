### CHRIS LIN 
A Stanford researcher is among
several st ientists nationwide who are
studying the use of omega-3 fiutv
acids in treating mental disorders
Midi as depression, manic depres
sion and possibly schizophrenia.
I )r. 1 erence Ketter, an «iss<x iate
professor of psychology and beha\ -
ioral sciences, is actively conduct
ing research in the field. 1 'lie acids
have previously been used to treat
vascular and heart troubles.
ketter's research entails a year
long study .it Stanford to observe the
eflec is of fish oil pills on bipolar dis
order, often known .is manic depres
sion. Fish oil, and seafood in general,
is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
People suffering from bipolar dis
order currently have treatment op
tions available, including drugs sue h
as Depakote (divalproex sodium),
lithium and Zyprexa (olanzapine).
Ketter said potential mothers
might l>e interested in panicipating
in his studv because birth defects
» h cur in one pert ent of babies whose
mothers used bipolar disorder med
ication. I nlike the other drugs, fish
oil is a natural medication.

In the study, subjects are ran
domly assigned to receive either
fish oil or a plat ebo and are not told
which pill tiiev are taking.
Harvard psychiatrist Dr. An
drew Stoll has led the recent move
ment in support of the benefits of
omega-3 fatty acids in treating
mental disorders.
Stoll's research, published in
1999. indit ates a strong correlation
between foods rich in omega-3
fatty acids and mental disorders. In
Stoll's studv. patients were given
nine grams of omega-3 fatty acids a
day. I low ever, to obtain that mut h
omega-3 with fish oil pills currentl\
available, a patient would need to
consume 30 pills a da\
I he usefulness of omega-3 is
still under debate.
"Omega-3 fatty at ids seem to
work best in cases of mild bipolar
disorder," Ketter said.
Ketter said he does not believe
omega-3 fattv at ids are particu
larlv useful m cases of strong
manic depression.
I he power ol omega-3 fatty
at ids lies in then abilit\ lo stabilize
cell membranes and strengthen
the internals of i ei tain t ells, sm li .is

nerve cells in the brain.
Bipolar disorder and mental
disorders in general occur in
greater frequent \ on college cam
puses like Stanford. Ketter said.
" Bipt >lar dist >rder mav be assot i
atetl with an int lease in creativity."
he said. "Ifvou have a high func

Keller said tneinbei> of the
Stanford communitv are partici

fish oil pills are "fish burps' and
fishy breath.
