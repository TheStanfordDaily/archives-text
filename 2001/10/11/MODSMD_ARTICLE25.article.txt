He's not the biggest guy in the pool, but he just might be the baddest. Senior Onno Koelman
brings toughness to the Stanford men's water polo squad, not to mention a deft scoring touch.
(lentre dub swim team, when he
noticed others playing water polo
in the adjacent pool. It turned out
that a new state-wide water polo
program was being launched.
"It looked like they were ha\ing
a lot more lun, so I dec ided to try it
out." Koelman said. "The I I'd he
came my home for the next couple
of years. All the drills we did there
led to excellent individual skills in
all our players."
Coached l>\ ("»arv Roberts, a for
mer team captain at L CIA, Koel
man learned important skills and
fundamentals, whic li propelled him
into joining the state and national
Under-17 and I nder-20 teams.
During his last year of high
school, Koelman traveled to Eu
rope with the vouth squad, where
he acquired valuable experience
plaving against top-notch Euro
pean teams.
"Seeing how they do it in real
international water polo, where
the level is so high, teaches you a
lot," Koelman said. "We experi
enced first-hand the Hungarian
press and counterattack, and the
brutality ol the Spaniards and the
Russians."
II prospects were so great for
Koelman in Australia, how did he
end up thousands of miles awa\
from home? And not in Europe,
but in the I niled States, where lie
was born (in I louston, I cxas)r
I he answer is simple — ranked
in the top percentile within lus
country, Koelman wanted to at

tend an American university that
provided good ac ademic opportu
nities. So he compiled a list ol top
colleges and went to the I S. Em
bassy in Melbourne, where he
asked which universities also en
joyed a strong water polo pro
grain. I ledisc overed that Stanford
offered him the best opportunity.
"Mv patents wanted me to go to
a real univet sit\ instead of a Mic ke\
Mouse one down the road, which
was I'lan K." Koelman said. "So, I
c ante here it > this wonderful place."
"Four years ago, when we re
cruited him, I didn't even know
who he was. Dettamanti said.
" I hough I had talked to a lew peo
ple who said lie w.is a good player,
I didn't i eall\ know what to expect.
When he got here, I was pleasantly
surprised. I It's very last and has
quit k hands and ver\ good le^s."
At cording to I )ettamanti, Kt•el
man is the team's best defender in
terms of helping out his team
mates. He would often leave the
opponent he is guarding and dou
ble-team someone else, frequeniK
managing to steal the hall and to
execute a cjuick counterattack. In
fact, one ol the team's defenses is
named after him, the'()nno drop.'
"He's like a little pest out there."
Dettamanti said. "Othei teams
hate to pla\ .igainst him because

I would argue that ()nnod<x's more
for this team t li.tn any other person,
lie is, in short, 11 it- ultimate team
player: aggressive, competitive, dv

Koelman's offensive play has
improved a lot, however, since his
arrival at the Farm.
"What he had the most prob
lems with when he first got here
was bis outside shooting, because
he's not a real big guv, and be
doesn't have the si/e behind him to
throw the ball bard." Dettamanti
said. "But lie's worked a lot on bis
shots, alwavs moving, always dri
ving towards the goal and getting
free in front of it."
I Ins quickness and mobility
helped koelman score 19 goals last
season and 11 the vear before.
"We've got an excellent slatting

c ante here it > this wonderful place."
"Four years ago, when we re
cruited him, I didn't even know
who he was. Dettamanti said.
" I hough I had talked to a lew peo
ple who said lie w.is a good player,
I didn't i eall\ know what to expect.
When he got here, I was pleasantly
surprised. I It's very last and has
quit k hands and ver\ good le^s."
At cording to I )ettamanti, Kt•el
man is the team's best defender in
terms of helping out his team
mates. He would often leave the
opponent he is guarding and dou
ble-team someone else, frequeniK
managing to steal the hall and to
execute a cjuick counterattack. In
fact, one ol the team's defenses is
named after him, the'()nno drop.'
"He's like a little pest out there."
Dettamanti said. "Othei teams
hate to pla\ .igainst him because
lie's jll si .ill ovet the plate, on de
fense and on oflense
"()nnt> is the t\pc* of playei tli.it

I would argue that ()nnod<x's more
for this team t li.tn any other person,
lie is, in short, 11 it- ultimate team
player: aggressive, competitive, dv
natnic and foe used."
Koelman's offensive play has
improved a lot, however, since his
arrival at the Farm.
"What he had the most prob
lems with when he first got here
was bis outside shooting, because
he's not a real big guv, and be
doesn't have the si/e behind him to
throw the ball bard." Dettamanti
said. "But lie's worked a lot on bis
shots, alwavs moving, always dri
ving towards the goal and getting
free in front of it."
I Ins quickness and mobility
helped koelman score 19 goals last
season and 11 the vear before.
"We've got an excellent slatting
lineup, which I II put against am
team in the country," Dettamanti
s.tid."()nno was the final piece oft he
pu//.le tb.it lit in there and be realh
complements the other plavers."

sport with academic excellence. His
