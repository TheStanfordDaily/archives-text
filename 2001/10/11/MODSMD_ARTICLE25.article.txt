Onno Koeltnan is the onl\ one.
At 5-foot-1 1, he ina\ be the
smallest pla\et in the water, but
lie's also one of the quit ki.
I o compensate for his lack of
physical si/e, Koeltnan has dexel
oped aina/ing speed and agilitx.

"I was .1 hig fish in .1 small

said. "I was used to being one of
the best playei sand was perhaps
a little cockv, so coming here
cured me of that.
While he s.it on the reserve
bench throughout most of his
first two seasons at the Farm,
koehnan used the time to gain
yaluable experience. In the off

"I think about polo a reason

so I don't lend to make the same

I lie Vusiraliau's passion for
watei polo w.is not discoyered
until be was in high school,
though be was introduced to I lie

brings toughness to the Stanford men's water polo squad, not to mention a deft scoring touch.
