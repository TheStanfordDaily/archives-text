# Birch betrays her age

### RYAN SAND 
I Mora Bin I) is one ol those I lollvwood
kids. Born and raised in 1 os Angeles, Bin li
began bet "ac ting eareer" .it age lour, as a
pit( hwoman l<»i Quaker Oats and Vlasit
pickles. Alter a mixed slew ol l\ sbows, in
cluding "Doogie Ilowser, Ni l).. Birch
made her wa\ into movies with a handful ol
parts in children's lilins. I'hese films in
cluded "All I Want l oi ('.hristnias." "I locus
I'ot us' and the uproariously hums "MOll
- I rouble. Birth's c.ireer continued to
expand and led to roles in whit h she made
the cinematic transition Iroin one-dimen
sion.il child characters t<> more engaging
.ind relevant teenage roles.
In her most recent film, "(iliost World,"
Birch portravs Knid, .1 recent high school
graduate without plans 01 direction. With
liei best h ieud Rfbecca, plaved soberb and
solidb li\ 15-vear'-old Scailett Johansson,
Enid struggles to define hersell through
disassot iation from her peers and town.
I Itf two search loi something honest
among thf sub-cultures, alterna-tulturcs
and fringes. Rebecca and Knid's'elitist* de
lights are those which are private, ironic
and honest in their intention: '70s Holly
wood musicals, pseudo-retro-diners,
bondage shops and monogamous Sa
tanists. Despite the initial strength tlis
played by her re jet lion ol the norms <>l her
peers, Knid's self-imposed distance reveals
emptiness and soul seart hing.
I lie lilm is gracefully adaptetl from
Daniel ('.lowes' underground coinit. whit h
ran as a serial Iroin I WW until ('.lowfs
worked with directoi I'eriA /wigoll'for al
most two years developing the st 1 ipt before
production actually began. (Howes himself
made the casting choices lor the lilm and
had very spet ilit ideas about how Knid and
Rebecca should be port raved, (lowes had
originalh wanted Christina Ricci lor the
part of Knid, but alter script delays pushed
b.u k the shooting, he decided that she was
too old lot the part. (Don't mention this to
I bora Bin h — she Y()('.AI I A' staled that
she hates comparisons to Ms. Ricci.). De
ciding on then bS-vear-oltl Birch lot the
part, ( lowes continued throughout pro

sure that the voite and
sense of his tharacters
were presei ved.

make her wandering and lici decision at
the end ol the lilm understandable and
comforting.
"Knitl is happ\ being a person that is
somewhat hard lo untlei stand, but she def
iuiteb craves acceptance." Birth said.
Much of the humor in the lilm springs liom
the tension between iron) and honesty.
Kind eventualh finds an honest applet la
tum lor something in the i b.u at tei ol Sey -
nitiur (Steve Busceini). Seymour does not
appear in ('.lowes' original coinit but was
treated to lit the format of the movie nar
rative. A soinetinies-sclf-loathing, sell-tle
st i ihed loser. Sevmoui appeals to Knid and
she finds hersell latching onto him loi a
sense of belonging. I lie subsequent 'io

tween the two unauchored individuals,
who are too alike lo be able to be anvthing
hut harmlul to eat h other.

When asked whether she itlciititicci with
Knid, Birch answered. "I lure were parts
of tinsel! ih.it were siinil.tt to Knid .it the
time oHilming. hut I'm not sine il th.it was
re.illx me or me heing allected In the role.
I'odav. I think that I n id would hedillereut

portrayal ol Knid there is jiim enough
knowledge and |ttsi enough contusion to
rendei hei helievahle, independent and

liirch assures thai she actually likes "all

too. She plans on trying them hot h at some
point, claiming, "I in not all darkness,

Bcvond continuing acting, liircli has
other long-term goals. She says,"In the

Hut first, I'd like to work with a largei va
riety of directors before I trv. I here's ac
tnalh something I'm thinking of produc

promise and possibility in the intelligent
teenage roles she has taken in i ecent films.
