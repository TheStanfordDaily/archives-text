# Liam: cute, spunky and dirt poor
## 
### RANDY MANO 
Ii always happens that poor, im
poverished Hollywood families seem
to have spunky, <ute little boys. Re
call "Billy Flliot," or "Angela's
Ashes." But fortunateh lor audiences
in search lor something to see this
weekend, "I.iam" works magnificent
ly. Despite its random, symholii end
ing, this film — directed by Stephen
Frears — makes lull use ol the title
child without manipulation.
A veteran director, I rears is best

known to Americans for his previous work on Dan
gerous Liaisons" and last year's "High Fidelity." With
"I.iam," he makes another about-face with .1 serious
examination of class, race, religion and family within
the context of 1930s Liverpool. Frears turns the po
tentially ultra-depressing subject matter into a movie

of excellently balanced humor, drama and love.
Ilit- story lotuses on I.iam O'Sullivan (a charming

Authoin 801 rows), who is
the youngest »liild in ,1
family ol five. 11 is older
brothei (on (David Hart)
and sistei Teresa (Megan
Burns) are loi ced to begin
woiking after their father
(I.in 11. nt) is laid oil from
his blue-collar job. I imes
are tough for the family, .is
the Depression and the
looming war begin to add

stress to the already strained relationships.
Some novel twists definitely kept me engaged
throughout the film. Krears opens with a joyous New
Year's Kve celebration for the adults — with the kiddies
peering through the bar windows — and then slowly
unwinds into a darker and tougher reality.

1 lie inclusion of Judaism in "Liani "is a welcome sight.
I didn't even realize there were |ews living in Liverpool
in pre-WVVII Kngland, or that they were outlasted l)\
Fascist elements within the country. The lad that Tere
sa sacrifices so much pride in working lor a well-to-do
|ewish family, even to the point ol cleaning toilets, real
ly weighs heavih into hei noble (harai ter and devotion
to family.
Hut the hig star is I.iam, who anchors the difficult
story. I lis ( nriosity, .is well as his gut-wrenching speei li
impediment, slowly gives us an idea about what it would
have been like for .1 very young boy wandering through
the organized chaos in Kngland. As an actor, Burrows
appears to have ,1 great future lined up for him . . .as
suming he ( «tn outlast his childhood days.
Overall, then, "Liam" treats you to an honest look —
much of it from an innocent child's perspective — at the
tribulations of a struggling family in Liverpool as Kng
land struggled to deal wit li economic depression, rat ism
and political instability.
