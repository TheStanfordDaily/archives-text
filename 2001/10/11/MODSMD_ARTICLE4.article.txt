### RICHARD FRANKLIN 
As high school seniors begin to appl)
f< >r c < )lleges. last month's terrorist atta< ks
have raised the question ()f whether there
will be an impact on applicant pools at
universities. However, officials nation
wide suggest (hat there will be little
change, il am, in students' decisions to
appl\ to s( hools.
Robin M.unlet, Stanford's clean of
undergraduate admission and financial
aid. s.iid, "We're not notic mg any drop
ofl in interest in Stanford from across
the country."
Students are not willing to sacrifice a
top-c hoic e s« hool .is ,i result of concerns
about travel requirements or distance
from home, Mamlet s;ii< 1.
"It's too earl\ to reallv know for sure,"
she s.iid, noting that the first round of
deadlines for applications has not vet
passed. " I lowever, we do have to be pre
pared because so much c an change.''
Admissions representatives from sue h
schools as (iolumbia, NYI and 1 larvard

al so said thev have seen no substantive
c hanges in their applic ant pools.
And) Ratto, a senior at Newbin \ Pat k
I ligh School in Soul hern (lalifoi nia. s.iid,
" 1 be only terrorist-related thing 1 could
see is airfare or oilier travel problems as
being a prohibitive fa< toi
However, Ratto said he does not see
siuli faetoi s as being set ious enough to pre
vent him from considering some Vast ( oasi
s< liools. such as I larvard and l'i inceton.
"I'm about making m\ dec ision based
on the college itself, even if traveling
might be a little harder." he said.
At New York City's renowned
Stuyvesant I ligh School, which t ec>pened
only ibis week after a massive c leanup ef
fort in the wake of the attacks, college
counselor Patricia ('.lean said she has
seen no change in college decisions b\
her students. ( hit of a graduating < lass (>1
more than 700, she said no students have
told her that the terrorist atlac ks have af
fected their plans.
According to Clean. Stuvvesant stu
dents have also not shown an indication

of preference for colleges in less urban
areas, even though the* s( hool is located a
mere three bloc ks from (iround Zero at
the World I rade (lenter site.
"I see ihat they're siill interested in the
same competitive schools," Glean said.
"Columbia, Harvard, Stanford ... no
mallei whethei lliey are urban. We're
not sa\iug that there aren't subtle
c hanges, but in tn\ experience they're
I »i is\ wiiboihei things, i lying to move on.
" I lies 've shown ania/ing adaptability and
lle\ihilit\ despite what happened, and they're
not tfoing t(» let this ailed theii dec isions."
\\ bile admissions olfic i.ils said they do
not foresee am immediate c hanges, the\
are aw are of the uncertainty of the future.
Mamlel dis< ussed the likelihood of in
creased financial need as a result of the
< in rent recession.
"We're aware that there may well be in
cTeased need and we're liill\ prepared for
that," she' said. "We understand that
though many were aflec ted directly, many
were alsoallec led indirectly as a result of the
tipple ellert in the economy. We stand

ready to respond lo students whose ibilittes
to pay for college i hange.asa result of this."
But despite the willingness of many
colleges to help students with limited fi
nancial resources, for some the I iff t \ tu
ition bills will prove too hurt leu some to
take on. In addition, students will not
find out their full (mailt ial aid status until
they arc oflicialh attcptcd next year.
Aside from travel and finaiu ial t onsid
erations, the attat ks ha\e also giyen i ise
to more sensitive political conditions .it
some universities.
"I am a little concerned about the re
action that o(< uned on some campuses,
like the protest at Berkeley." Ratio said,
referring to the more than 2.000 students
who staged an anti-war protest at the
campus on Sept. 20. Rat to s;ii< I he be
lieves the rally max have become exces
sive and extreme in nature .is more peo
ple joined in.
"While I don't know that it would pre
vent me from going there, it might not
necessarih provide the atmosphere that
I'm looking for,"he s.iid.
