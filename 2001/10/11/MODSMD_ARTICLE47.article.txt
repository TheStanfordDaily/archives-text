# Not much 'Joy' in Leelee Sobieski's 'Ride'
## 
### CHRIS LEE 
l.celee Sobieski, despite ini
ii.il appearances, is not Helen
Hunt. I'm not sure why, but
ihere's always been something
about her that keeps me from
taking her seriously .is an ac
tress. Maybe it's her llat deliv
ery, or the fact that she's about

as animated .is .1 block ol wood.
Whatever the (.ise, while she

record li.is been kind ol spoil)
too, made up of such dubious
fare as the saccharine "I lere on
Earth" and the humdrum
"Deep Imp.M t."
(.onsider it even more ama/-

Ahrains is co-cre

and the same easy

oike pervaded that
show helps am hoi
this i idit nlons plot.
II you haven't
figured it out Irom
the promotional

material, the story is about two
brothers on a road trip who
manage to piss oil .1 mystei ions
truck driver by (literally) Hill

interest, and before long all
three are chased by the menac

faceless monster who will stop
ai nothing to get back .11 them.

II this sounds familiar, it's be
-1 ,inse Spielberg jinnpsiai ted his
career decades ago with the
similai l\ -tltemed "I)uel. I liink
of "Joy Ride" as .1 modern \ ari
ation with slightb better-drawn
characters.
l.arl\ on, the stoi \ line makes
two wise decisions: to lot get
that it's .1
teen movie,

I.ml critics
who pride
I lie msc I ve.s
011 pointing
out the

< lie lies ol 1 lie genre. .11 id to keep
Ms. Sobieski's part to a bare
minimum.
All right, I'm probably being
too hard on the actress; hut the
story is unique in lli.it it is about
the relationship between the
two brothers, played by Steve
/aim and Paul Walker (from
"The l ast and the Furious." as
well as every other teen movie

in recent memory).
I've heen looking out for
Zahn ever since he turned up
in I <»iii ll.uiks's endearing
" l li.it riling You Do," and this
being one ol his few leading
roles, lie carries the weight
quite effectively.
He plays the troublemaker
Fuller brilliantly, deftly strad
dling the line between all out
goofhall and a loving il Hawed
human being.
Walker does a good enough
job playing of! of him, and So
bieski usuallv isn't around long
enough to drag it all down.
()ops, there I go again.
I lie script does an ad
mirable job ol distracting us,
.ind director John Dalil (" I he
l.ast Seduction") demonstrates
a good knack for staging and
manipulation.
There are still plot holes you
could drive your own truck
through, and a few story de
vices might make you sell
aware, but "Joy Ride" is one of
the better movies of its type.


Stop looking at my nuts.
