# Hospital budget looking better
## Financial costs were cut by reducing the number of hospital vendors and streamlining the nursing budget 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
A series of cost-cutting measures at Stanford 1 lospital
have resulted in a budget lot the fiscal vear 2001-02 that
is far more positive than previous estimates, with pro
jetted losses of $9.8 million.
1 his news follows a previous announcement that esti
mated losses at $28 million for 2001, whit li, though a sig
nificant loss, was an improvement from a spring estimate
that had produced a dreary $40 million figure.
I he cost-cutting measures that were made to counter
the mounting losses were in two main areas — medical
supply expense and the nursing budget, according it)
Stanford I lospital (lliief Financial ()ffit er Ken Sharigan.
"()ne of our areas of lot us was looking at medical sup
ply expense which is quite high and moving to a policy
where we restricted ourselves to two vendors." Sharigan
said. "This would enable the hospital to receive better
price concessions."
The streamlining of the nursing budget, meanwhile,
was essentially a staffing issue — a problem of determin

ing the number of nursing hours provided to a particu
lar patient.
" I he reductions in the nursing budget will bring lis
into line with benchmarks while not compromising the
quality of c are," Sharigan said.
flic measures also required the discarding of certain
health plan contracts and programs that were unprofitable.
Meanwhile, Lucile Packard Children's I lospital expe
rienced $3 million in losses, which, according to Sharig
an, was ;i lot better than had been anticipated.
Sharigan also affirmed that further cutbacks are
planned.
"Stanford Hospital has run a significant loss this
year," he said. "The budget going into next year [2001 -
012J is still a loss and it is not sustainable in the long run
to have losses."
"Considering what we were facing, [the revised bud
get | gets us pretty close to reaching a break-even point,"
Michael Peterson, interim CEO of Stanford Hospital,
told the Stanford Report.
According to the Stanford Report, the achievement of
this budget, with an estimated .$741 million for opera
tional expenses, will require action in two areas: increas
ing patient volume in cardiac services and other depart
ments along with further cost reduction. In addition to
limiting the number of vendors, the number of contract
personnel will also be reduced, but only in c ertain areas.
