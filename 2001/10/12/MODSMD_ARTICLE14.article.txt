## The 						Stanford Daily Subcontracting not necessarily a palatable option

Published Since IS')I

Yrsterdav, Stanford students joined
workers in front o! the Sch(X)l of
Medi( i ne to protest Stanford manage
ment's possible expansion of subcon
tracting practices.
In an attempt to reduce costs, Stanford Hos
pital and Clinics are currcnth examining dif
ferent subcontrat ting agent ies' bids. Assuming
tbeir subcontracting plans tit) in fact go
through, Stanford management will then relo
cate unionized employees at the Hospital and
(llinics to different buildings anil hire subcon
tracted workers in their plat e.
I he practice of subcontrai tingwoi k is one in
which an employe! engages an outside part\ to
complete the performance of part of its busi
ness. In order to undertake the outlined work,

the subcontractor then hires its own employees.
In many cases, employers are not directh legal
ly responsible for subcontracted woi kcrs.
As a result, subcontrai ted workers are fre
quently subject to low wages, inordinately long
hours, high turnover rates and insufficient
health benefits. These problems arise because
the subcontracting companies for which they
work compete to provide the lowest tost to the
business employer, with little consideration
given to the well-being and fair compensation
of the workers.
Subcontracting is not unique to Stanford
Hospital and C.linics, or even Stanford, Inc.;
workers throughout the world have fought to
monitor subcontracting practices for years. Hut
the prevalence of such labor practices does not

justify Stanford's increasing sfiift in recent years
to subcontracted labor. Rather, Stanford should
take a stand as a leader in fair labor practices.
All Stanford workers, whether service em
ployees, faculty or administrators, serve an im
portant role in making Stanford a nationally
recognized institution; it only seems fait that all
Stanford workers be compensated with a fair
and living wage, as well as decent working con
ditions and treatment.
With a multibillion-ilollar endowment and a
reputation as one ol the preeminent universi
ties in the world, Stanford is in a position of eco
nomic power and international attention.
Changes in its labor practices have significant
implications to labor struggles elsewhere.
