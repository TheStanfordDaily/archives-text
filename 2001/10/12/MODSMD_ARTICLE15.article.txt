We keep (tin fingers ( lose <)|:
I In* pulse ol the campus
fortunately, (his is possihk
through 1- in ail, and wt
never, evei have to get lip from our chairs
So afici returning from a sununei when
one ol us was lu< k\ enough to receiu
mono, and I In* other received a sad, \ei
genuine invitation to sleep in .1 research
lab, we 1 an easih sense the feelings of long
ing and emptiness experienced l>\ .ill up
pert lassnien. And grad students, f.spet ial-

I\ gl.ld St tldcilt S.
Ihe I nivei sit \ lias
imposed .1 di .k oni;m
lockdown litis year.
Kveia (lax. students wake
up to .1 bright, shining
sun. leeling tree ,incl
liappv. What an illusion.
Since happiness 01 ion
tenttnent or even a sem
blance <>l satisfaction in

life are not parts of our vocahularv, let us
pass out \v< n (Is ol wisdom to voti.
Main inquiring minds, l>ui mosth
ours, want to know: where the hell are .til
the freshman Kacebooks:"
Ali, the sweet, sweet facehook. A hook
ol tac es, realh , exposing w ide-eved fresh -
tnen and theii soon-to-he-crushed
dreams. We're not sure what 111.ikes the
sanctitv of the Kaccbook more import,mt
to the Stanford administration than a
readable lime Schedule, hut we're quite
certain that there exists a fai-reaching
conspir.u v to keep tlietn out ol the hands
of deserving readers like us.
With over 1 ,(>OO freshmen in the ('.lass
of 200"), one would think it cas\ for two
fairly bright, faith unattractive sopho
mores to swipe a cop\ or two or seven.
And yet, among the 112 t antic searches
that .ill uppcK lassmcn have been coil
ducting in the hopes of finding that one,
unguarded copv, the freshmen seem so
casual and oblivious, l.et's be honest:
we've all sneaked into at least one fresh
man's room iinl told him to go outside
because Stanford does this cool thing
the first week outside. I lien we've pro
ceeded to ransack his desk for the l-'ace
book. Kvervonc's done it.and that raises
the real point of our policv recommen
dation to the I niversit\: please, let us all
have one.
I ppere lassmcn want to recognize the
new students b\ name and make them feel
at home in this vulnerable time in their
lives by knowing theii names, hometown

and room nuniher; we must test Darwin's
iheor\ ol reproductive success; and litial-
Iv, \\e want to recogni/e the next obnox
ious gu\ who will d \ for attention In get
ting naked evervwhere he g< >cs.
We are not passive observers 111 this
struggle loi the freedom ol information.
Indeed, we have even done rescart h into
this travestx that we can legall\ admit to.
I.xl libit A: Doug was an ()i ientation Vol
unteei this veai.
(Side note: do not ever be t onned into
being an OV. Noiu cncrgv, friendliness

and love foi Stanford are
required fora total of
about IS minutes when
\Oll tell confused parents
w here to pit k up their
box 1111K lies. I he rest of
\our time is spent setting
up thousands of (hairs
and wanting to shoot
\oursell 111 the face for

appK ing to be an ()\ .)
\nvwav, while walking around in a cir
(le lot three hours stuffing those little bags
freshmen get, he saw another male ()\
start to llip through a l acebook. After that,
it gets kind of bluriA because the decibel
level of the s< rec( li from the ()i ientation
directoi veiling "I'l I I lIAI KA(IK
HOOK DOWN knocked something
loose in Ins head.
Kxhibil H: Pretending he needed to
find the residence of a friend from back
home. Ramit went to the nearest transfer
room to ask fOl .1 facehook (bee ause trans
fer students are the few luckv upperclass
nien who receive them). Shoe ktnglv, eat li
of them looked through her desk and
could not find one.
"I don't know where it is! Do you think
someone stole it ?" one shrieked. Ihe odds
of three Kacebooks in the same dorm
room being lost are ridic ulouslv tninisc ule.
So, to the I niversity administrators
and the damned armed guard who watch
es over the dwindling stacks of freshman
Kacebooks in the basement of Mitchell
Hall, do the student body .1 true service.
Increase I niversity-widc communication
.md sharing today, because the freshmen
this year are really quite hot. 1 he Univer
sit\ would do well to consider the needs of
its students. Kxcept for grad students, be
cause that's just shady.

Doug and Haunt, both undeclared sophomores,
still haven 7 found a bacebook. To help them, e
