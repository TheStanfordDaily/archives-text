Terrorist attacks cannot be justified
Mike Dolphin's question in .1 letter u>
the editor from I liins<Li\ should not be
why 90 percent of Americans support tlie
bombings in Afghanistan. It should be
why he feels the need to juMif\ terror di
rected specific ,ill\ towards innocent hu
mans who happen to live in the I nited
States and Israel. I erroi isi attac against
innocent people in the name of am (.uisc
are never justified and I have never and
will never hear an argument that will c 011-
vince me otherwise.
First, Dolphin claims that we should
question why these terrorists made the
"rational" decision to kill thousands of
people. I le asserts th.it " I he\ have s.iid. 'I
believe so strongly in changing this world
that I am willing to sacrifice m\ life for the
cause. " What cause? Io rid the world of
America and Israel and to make sure that
the whole Middle Fast sta\s under dicta
torship? Because in the end, that is what
these terrorists want.
If you don't believe me, then read the
words of Joseph Farrah, an Arab-Ameri
can journalist: "He (bin Laden] has man
aged to enshrine himself as the hero to
hundreds of millions of radical Muslims
worldwide whose go.il is — and always has
been — the destruction of the Jewish state
and, ultimately, Islamic hegemony over
the whole world." I his is the 'valid point'
that bin I .aden and al-Qaeda want to make
to the world.
Dolphin's letter only seeks to perpetu
ate the myth of the evil Israeli state waging
a war against the innocent Palestinians
who cannot defend themselves and have

no one to support them. Israel is not
"killing Palestinians in their claim of the
I lol\ I and." Israel is defending its right to
c\isi .is .1 sovereign state that has been rec
ogni/ed l>\ most other states in the world
as well as the I nited Nations.
Iwen day, Israel is bombarded with
suicide attai ks, bombings, and shoot
ings Just as there have been Palestinian
deaths and casualties, there have been
Israeli deaths and casualties. If all of a
sudden Israel dec ided to stop defending
itself and the I .S. ended its policy of aid
ing the- country, do you honestly think
that its enemies would stop attacking and
embrace its people? Sadly, that's not how
the world works.
I bird, yes, there are fanatics in Israel
who use religion as a tool to galvanize their
cause just as we know there are religious
fanatics on the other side as well. I lowev
er, the difference between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority is that Israel controls
its fanatics while Arafat gives them a free
hand to cause unwarranted pain to a
whole nation.
I also hope that soon the U.S. bombs
will stop falling in Afghanistan and that Is
rael will not have to react to Palestinian at
tacks. I hope that my family in both Amer
ica and in Israel will be safe and won't have
to run to the store to buy gas masks or not
leave the house at all for fear of a bus blow
ing up beside them while they walk down
the street. However, for the moment, I'd
rather not appease the terrorists.

U.S. should not take counsel of terrorists
I his is in response to Mike Dolphin's
letter to the editor entitled Bombing
Afghanistan will not make things better.' 1
was rather concerned by Mr. Dolphin's
letter and the points he attempted to
make. In addition to several errors in his
statement, Mr. Dolphin makes some dan
gerous suggestions as to how the U.S.
should respond to the Sept. 1 1 attacks.
Perhaps the most disturbing of his ar
guments was the notion that the U.S. mil
itary operation in Afghanistan is "more
proof for those against us that we are the
true menace." Mr. Dolphin, the U.S.
bombings are designed to hinder terrorist
activities; our attacks serve a purpose. We
are punishing a group who willingly and
knowingly support a terrorist network.
1 hey, on the other hand, attacked inno
cent civilians who had nothing to do with
the decisions that led to the attacks. How
can you ( all us the menace?
I am further concerned by Mr. Dol
phin s description of the attacks as having
killed 'mere thousands." These thou
sands who may seem mere to him were in
nocent men and women who have chil
dren and parents, and all they did was go
to work on a Tuesday morning.
Mr. Dolphin goes on to explain that the
perpetrators of the attacks were willing to
die fora cause they viewed as more im
portant than their own lives and that they
"are not crazy' people." These terrorists
whom beseems intent on martyring killed
