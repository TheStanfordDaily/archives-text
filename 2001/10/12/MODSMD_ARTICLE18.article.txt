I he Stanford I lumanities Lab
oratory is hosting an ()pen I louse
to present research opportunities
to students and to showcase the
lab's projec is to the Stanford 10111-
munity.
" I he humanities lab is entirely
unique, said Italian Prof. |ef!iey
S< linapp, the lab's tliret tor. " I here
is nothing equivalent to the human
ities lab anyw here in the worltl."
W hat makes the lab more excit
ing l< n students, he sa\ s, is their abil
ity to get involved in kev positions
on researt Ii teams.
"A substantial part of the re
seart h team is made up of
students — graduate and under
graduate," St linapp said.
"Instead of |iist studying books
111 a classroom, students can have
the opport unit\, as an undergradu
ate, of producing new knowledge.
I his has not traditionally been
available."
Meg W'orlev, a (lomparativc Lit
erature dot tor.il student and the
lab's associate directoi said that
about U5 undergraduates and 25
g rath late students part it ipatein kev
roles in the researt h at the lab.
She also emphasized that the

lead in a project doesn't need to be
a faculty member.
"We have had gratl students as
leads, and we would be happy to
have staff as leads too," she said.
What sparked the ( reation of the
lab in early 2000, Sc linapp said, was
the realization that in today sacade
mic world, collaboration is neces
sary to produce quality work about
a large-sc ale topic.
"We inhabit a world where there
is no way any single individual can
have all types of knowledge. II you
are really going to envisage truly
ambitious large-scale projects, col
laborations is often an inevitable so
lution," he said.
1 he humanities lab's projects
eat h alst) involve technological
components, and their research
teams include tec hnology experts.
"While humanities lab is not tech
nology-driven, we are very interest
ed in taking advantage of the special
opportunities that developments in
tec hnologv ofler," St linapp said.
"Lots of times, a project lead
does not have a lot of tec hnologit.il
experience," Worley said. "We
have the resources to help them
present their work in .1 tec Imologi
cal format."
Pat h project has a Web site
where material is published. Wor

lon said tliat theiise of the Internet
has allowed .1 vjder variety of re
seari li to he pubished than has tra
dition.ill) been tlie case.
Still, she wa» careful to note that
the type of reseax h the humanists
.it the lab are < inducting is not
llashy and insubst^uial.
"We aren't lowering the bar in
scholarship. We're presenting the
same issues specials have known
about fora long title to a broader
audience," she said "Technology is
key to presenting lujn.mities that
reai h out to the uninijrested."
