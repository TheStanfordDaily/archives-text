Tomorrow: No. 23 Stanford vs.
Washington Slate, 2 p.m., Stanford
Stadium.

Yet when the polls were released last
weekend, the (Cougars were left out. 1 lie
squad's 5-0 record, 20 point average margin
of victorx and astronomical statistics meant
nothing to the poll s votei s.
Pit ked to finish last in the l\u -10 presea

season has fiiiled to earn the respect the

Although the (Cardinal has met stiflei

defense lias xet to experience such a potent

"I'm impressed with their big play ability,"
Cardinal senior defensive end Marcus

Blowouts of such mediocre programs as
Idaho, Boise State and (California have done
little to Ixilster the (Cougars' ranking.
Stanford's situation is remarkably similar
to the (Cougars. 1 lie Cardinal has vet to be

I he (Cardinal's next four opponents are a

and for good reason.

Kven when the Cougars are not airing it

Mike Bush, tliey are still extrenielv danger

heads tht' Cougar rushing attack, averaging
nearly 118 yards a game.
Fortunately tor the Cardinal, Minnich
was injured in last weekend's win over Ore
gon State. Minnich had a breakout game in
the contest, demolishing the Beavers for 195
\ai ds on the ground, a tout hdown catch and
a touchdown pass.
On Wednesday, Minnich had cartilage
repaired on his i ight knee and should be out
for two to four weeks. Replacing the senior
leader will be unproven freshman Allan
Thompson.
"Losing Dave is a big blow to this team, as
much for his leadership as his abilih to run
and catch the football," Price said.
Stanford, on the other hand, has fully re
cuperated during the bye week, and the (ar

I'he Cougars have allowed )iist 001 ushing

Washington State has not faced a versatile
quarterback like Fasani vet this season and
