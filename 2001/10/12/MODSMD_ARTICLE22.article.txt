MEN S WATER POLO
Today: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 10 Loy
ola Marymount, 3 p.m., Avery Aquatics
Center.
Weekend-NorCal Tournament:
Stanford vs. Santa Clara, Saturday,
9:15 a.m., Avery Aquatics Center.

With five wins so far, Stanford is poised to
double that number in just three days.
I he Cardinal squad (5-0, 3-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) is facing a tough
weekend at home, as it prepares to battle
No. 10 Loyola Marymount (7-0) in a non
league game today and then host the Nor-
Cal Water Polo Tournament on Saturday
and Sunday.
Loyola Marymount's main threat

tomes from its leading scorers. Stephen
I.ipinski, the younger brother of former
(l.ii (linal standout Michael Lipinski, has
tallied 30 goals so far, while his teammates
Kris liarr and lamas Szego have 20 and
17, respectively.
One ol the best teams in the Western
Water Polo Association, LMU has not been
able to lx*at any of its MPSF opponents this
season, though in some of the games it came
quite close.
"They are very capable," said Stan
ford head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"Last year in this tournament they gave
us a pretty tough game, especially in the
second half."
I lu' Cardinal squad will have little
time to rest before it faces Santa Clara
the next morning in its first game of the
tournament.
"[Santa Clara] shouldn't give us too
much trouble," Dettamanti said. "They
aren't the caliber of some of the other teams
that will be playing here."
If Stanford beats Santa Clara, it will face
the winner of the match Ix-tween No. 7 UC-
Irvineand No. 0 UC-San Diego.
I C-San Diego could present a challenge

for Stanford. According to Dettanianti, it
was"the surprise of the nation" last season.
The Tritons were the first team outside of
the MPSF league to upset a conference
team, USC, and place second at the 2000
NCA\ Championships.
While the Tritons graduated most of
their starting lineup from last season, senior
hole man Jonathan Samuels is one of the top
in the nation.
However, UC-San Diego is not the only
opponent to watch out for this weekend. In
fact, 13 of the 15 participating teams are
ranked in the top 20.
fhe tournament lineup features other
top-10 teams including UCLA, Pepperdine,
California, Long Beach State, UC-Santa
Barbara and Ixnola Marymount.
"This weekend's going to Ik- the toughest
we've had all season," said senior co-captain
Pasi Dutton. "It'll also he a good chance to
see some of the teams from Southern Cali
fornia play."
Normally, this would have been the sea
son's second tournament, but the tragic
events on Sept. 11 led to the cancellation of

season, and the water polo team hope to come out of this weekend with five wins.
