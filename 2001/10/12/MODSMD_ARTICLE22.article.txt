With five wins so far, Stanford is poised to
double that number in just three days.
I he Cardinal squad (5-0, 3-0 Mountain

(l.ii (linal standout Michael Lipinski, has
tallied 30 goals so far, while his teammates
Kris liarr and lamas Szego have 20 and
17, respectively.
One ol the best teams in the Western
Water Polo Association, LMU has not been
able to lx*at any of its MPSF opponents this
season, though in some of the games it came
quite close.
"They are very capable," said Stan
ford head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"Last year in this tournament they gave
us a pretty tough game, especially in the
second half."
I lu' Cardinal squad will have little
time to rest before it faces Santa Clara
the next morning in its first game of the
tournament.
"[Santa Clara] shouldn't give us too
much trouble," Dettamanti said. "They
aren't the caliber of some of the other teams
that will be playing here."
If Stanford beats Santa Clara, it will face
the winner of the match Ix-tween No. 7 UC-
Irvineand No. 0 UC-San Diego.

for Stanford. According to Dettanianti, it
was"the surprise of the nation" last season.
The Tritons were the first team outside of
the MPSF league to upset a conference
team, USC, and place second at the 2000
NCA\ Championships.
While the Tritons graduated most of
their starting lineup from last season, senior
hole man Jonathan Samuels is one of the top
in the nation.
However, UC-San Diego is not the only
opponent to watch out for this weekend. In
fact, 13 of the 15 participating teams are
ranked in the top 20.

"This weekend's going to Ik- the toughest
we've had all season," said senior co-captain
Pasi Dutton. "It'll also he a good chance to
see some of the teams from Southern Cali

the tournament this weekend.
"Not playing 111 SoCal hurt
everyone because we're now
going into the games not knowing
aw hole lot about each other," Det
tamanti said. "A lot of teams
haven't had a 1 haiu:e to see each

Winning the tournament is

important for the (Cardinal be
cause every win increases its
chances of receiving the at-large
berth for the National (Champi
onships. It Stanford can main
tain its top rank, the squad would
automatically qualify for the
NCAAs and not have to worry
about winning the MI'SF confer

"II we win this tournament, we'd
remain the only undefeated team
in the country, and every team
th.it's in competition with us for
winning that at-large berth would
have had at least two losses," Detta

It will indeed be a long weekend
for the much sought-after Stanford

winning streak.

said. "We've proven ourselves in

haven't really been tested as tin* as a

Water Polo Association, LMU has not been
able to lx*at any of its MPSF opponents this
season, though in some of the games it came
quite close.
"They are very capable," said Stan
ford head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"Last year in this tournament they gave
us a pretty tough game, especially in the
second half."
I lu' Cardinal squad will have little
time to rest before it faces Santa Clara
the next morning in its first game of the
tournament.
"[Santa Clara] shouldn't give us too
much trouble," Dettamanti said. "They
aren't the caliber of some of the other teams
that will be playing here."
If Stanford beats Santa Clara, it will face
the winner of the match Ix-tween No. 7 UC-
Irvineand No. 0 UC-San Diego.
I C-San Diego could present a challenge

for Stanford. According to Dettanianti, it
was"the surprise of the nation" last season.
The Tritons were the first team outside of
the MPSF league to upset a conference
team, USC, and place second at the 2000
NCA\ Championships.
While the Tritons graduated most of
their starting lineup from last season, senior
hole man Jonathan Samuels is one of the top
in the nation.
However, UC-San Diego is not the only
opponent to watch out for this weekend. In
fact, 13 of the 15 participating teams are
ranked in the top 20.
fhe tournament lineup features other
top-10 teams including UCLA, Pepperdine,
California, Long Beach State, UC-Santa
Barbara and Ixnola Marymount.
"This weekend's going to Ik- the toughest
we've had all season," said senior co-captain
Pasi Dutton. "It'll also he a good chance to
see some of the teams from Southern Cali
fornia play."
Normally, this would have been the sea
son's second tournament, but the tragic
events on Sept. 11 led to the cancellation of

the SoCCal Fournainent. I bus, a
lot more weight will be placed on
the tournament this weekend.
"Not playing 111 SoCal hurt
everyone because we're now
going into the games not knowing
aw hole lot about each other," Det
tamanti said. "A lot of teams
haven't had a 1 haiu:e to see each
otliei pla\ \et so we haven't had a
c hance to scout."
Winning the tournament is

important for the (Cardinal be
cause every win increases its
chances of receiving the at-large
berth for the National (Champi
onships. It Stanford can main
tain its top rank, the squad would
automatically qualify for the
NCAAs and not have to worry
about winning the MI'SF confer
ence tournament.
"II we win this tournament, we'd
remain the only undefeated team
in the country, and every team
th.it's in competition with us for
winning that at-large berth would
have had at least two losses," Detta
manti said.

It will indeed be a long weekend
for the much sought-after Stanford
squad as its opponents try to end its
winning streak.
"Fvery team's going to be after
us and that's the price you pay
when you're number one," Hut
ton said.
Junior All-American Peter Hud
nut agreed.
" I his is definitely going to be the
biggest challenge for our team," he
said. "We've proven ourselves in
non-tournament play, but we
haven't really been tested as tin* as a
tournament goes. We're looking
forward to a new test."
