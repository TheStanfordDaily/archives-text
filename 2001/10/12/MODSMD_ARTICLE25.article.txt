Hie squad's first meet is at home uxlay against the
I niversitv of Pacific.
I Ik- (lardinal are favored to win today in what some
consider a warmup meet against a Pacific team which
historically has not been very strong.
"It will lx* a great meet tor us to get the kinks out and
get hat k into competition again," s.iid senior co-captain
Shelly Ripple.
Ripple's fellow co-captain, senior Jessica lost hi, who
contributed to a gold medal finish in the 4x200 free
relav in Beijing, thinks today's rate will help the team
prepare for two big ii|xoming meets.
At the end of the month, the Cardinal will swim
against Georgia, the three-time defending NCAA
champions and Texas, a favorite to capture the N( A\
title this year.
"| Today] we will be able to swim some off-events and
change the line-up a bit," lost hi said. "It will be a good
t bante to see where our rat ing skills are at right now
and to get bat k into that mode in preparation for the
bigger meets."
Despite losing Olympic gold medalist Misty

1 lyman to graduation last year, tin* team's prospects
are good. Hie addition of 14 new swimmers and five
new divers lias more than doubled the si/e of the
team, adding depth needed to win key meets
throughout the year.
"Our squad is now strong in numbers, which was
our biggest weakness last vear," Foschi said. "We as a
team feel very confident al>oiit our season this year and
arc looking to do some pretty great things."
Even the new members to the team, including fresh
man Katie are very excited for the upcom
ing season.
"1 think 1 speak for all the freshmen when I say that
coming to swim at Stanford has been a dream come
true," she said. "It's ama/ing to swim with such incred
ibly talented and supportive girls."
I'lie meet against Pacific will Ik* followed tomorrow
by the more casual Alumni Meet, in which current
members oft he swim team compete against past mem
bers . such as Jenny Thompson and Summer Sanders.
Head coach Richard Quick, in his 14th year of
coaching at Stanford, hopes that the first meet will
help determine the lineup for the big Georgia and
Texas meets.
"We are excited about the first meet to find out
about our new team â€” who will step up and who we
i an count on among the new members of the team,"
lie said. "We train to compete, so there is nothing
like a race to motivate tin- swimmers and see what
they can do."
Indeed, the team is very optimistic about its chances
for the national title.
"We all really want that NCAA team title this year,
which we missed out on last year by a mere 1.5 points."
Foschi said.
With such an abundance of swimmers, talent and
spirit, the (lardinal's chances look good.
