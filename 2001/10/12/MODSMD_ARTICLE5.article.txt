When Stanford alumnus C >iI |onas
opened a package from the Stanford Alum
ni Association around I hanksgiving o( last
year, his reaction was a combination of sur
prise and amusement. In the package was ,i
letter invitingJonas to attend the 50-year re
union of the Class of'sl — and on an inside
page of the package was a form asking alum
ni in which "multicultural reunions" they
would like to participate.
The source of Jonas's amusement was

this: in 1951, there was little racial diversity
to speak of at Stanford, let alone enough to
justify the creation of any kind of multicul
tural organization on campus.
Specifically, according to Jonas, there
were no African-American students on cam
pus during the late 1940s and early 19505.
"doming from New York City. I knew
something was strange during my first few
years here," he said. "In 1949, Stanford was
lily-white."
Several other Stanford students also no
ticed the lack of diversity at the University.
In 1949, about 15 of them, including Jonas,

formed Stanford's first NA\Cl'chapter, in
an attempt to end discrimination and bring
about greater diversity .it the University.
That winter, Roy Wilkins, administrative
assistant to NAACP leader Walter White,
visited their chapter on campus.
"Wilkins's advice to us was straightfor
ward and simple," said Jonas. "The device
employed by the college admissions office to
screen out [African-American] students was
the required photo on the application."
An admissions policy at the time —
then common among universities — re
quired students to attach a photograph to

their application.
"It was ,i polic \ that was peneived to Ix 1 ,
and had the potential to be disc riminatory,
although we can't know for sure," said
Kritjof I "hvgeson, ('lass of "51, one of the for
mer student \ AA( P members.
"I he NAACP nationwide was saying
that the prac ticc was discriminatory," said
Lois Whealev, another alumnus involved
in the effort.
Yet ac cording to Whealev, when she met
with then-Dean of Students Lawrence
Kimpton, he resisted the appeal that the
policy bee hanged, c iting the dubious reason

that if the admissions ollite saw .1 pit lure of
[an African-American] student, the\ might
purposefulK admit him just "to Ik- lair."
Stanford had admitted African-Ameri
can students before the earl\ l ( .>.">()s. at cord
ing to Asstx. Dean of Students Morris
(1 raves, although he added, "there mav not
have been anv Mrican-Amcrican students
admitted (lining some \eai s."
In fact, the first African-American student
at Stanford was a member of the \cia first
