What to Know About
IMMUNIZATIONS




Men's dorm, Encina Hall, 1891. Living in close quarters creates an ideal setting for the spread of
infectious diseases. Vaccination, a great public health achievement, has helped increase the average
U.S. life span by 25 years since this picture was taken.
You never "outgrow" your
need for vaccinations. Here's
an overview so you know which
ones to get.
Meningococcal
Meningitis
■ What it is: An inflammation of
the lining of the brain and spinal
cord caused by a bacteria.
■ Symptoms: Fever, severe
headache, stiff neck, and
mental changes. Also possibly
a flat red rash, particularly on
the arms and legs.
■ Prevalence: Relatively rare
(there are 1.5 cases per 100,000
in the U.S. for all ages). But
between 1991 and 1997 the
number of cases among 15 to
24 year-olds doubled.
■ Seriousness: Meningococcal
disease can lead to death
within 24 hours.
■ Shot effectiveness: Moderate.
The vaccine is about 85%
effective against the strains of
bacteria it addresses. But it
doesn't protect against
meningococcal type B, which
accounts for about 30% of the
cases in college students.
■ Recommendations: Public
Health experts recommend
that you consider having this
vaccine. Freshman students
living on campus have a
greater potential risk due to
group living conditions.
Others at higher risk: those
traveling to high-incidence
areas and people with
weakened immune systems.
■ Cost: $78.00
Hepatitis B
■ What it is: Hepatitis B is a
viral infection of the liver that
can lead to liver failure, liver
cancer, or death.
■ Symptoms: There may be
none, especially in infants or
young children, but it can also
bring on fever, abdominal
discomfort, nausea, vomiting,
diminished appetite, or jaundice.
■ Prevalence: Strikes about 5%
of adults in the U.S.; more in
other areas.
■ Seriousness: Potentially very
serious.
■ Shot effectiveness: Extremely
effective. This is the only vaccine
that can prevent a sexually
transmitted disease.
■ Recommendations: We strongly
recommend getting this shot,
especially for those at high
risk: people who are sexually
active, have multiple sex
partners, are homosexual
males, have had a sexually
transmitted disease (including
AIDS), those who are health
care workers, use inject-able
drugs, or live in a household
with a hepatitis B carrier.
■ Cost: $36.00 per shot; you need
three.
Flu What it is: Influenza, or "the
flu", is a virus-caused respira
tory illness.
Symptoms: High fever, severe
muscle aches, headache, and a
sore throat and cough.
■ Prevalence: Flu varies with the
season - it comes in winter and
early spring, and is relatively
common on campus then.
■ Seriousness: Can make vou
feel terrible, but recovery is
usually complete in healthy
adults.
■ Shot effectiveness: It varies,
but usually is effective for
the strains in the vaccine.
■ Recommendations: For high
risk individuals: people with
asthma or other lung disease,
heart conditions, diabetes,
kidney problems or a
weakened immune system,
health care workers, and
anyone else who wants to
avoid getting the flu.
■ Cost: $18.00.
Chickenpox
Recommended for adults who
have not had chickenpox.
$61.00 per shot; you need two.
Hepatitis A
Recommended for travelers and
food handlers, and people with
certain chronic diseases. $35.00 per
shot; you need two.
Tetanus
Recommended every ten years,
or sooner for a substantial
wound (you can record the date
you get it on back of your
driver's license). Cost: $23.00.
Measles & Rubella
Immunization is so important that
two shots are required for new
students to prevent an outbreak
on campus. $17.00 per shot.
