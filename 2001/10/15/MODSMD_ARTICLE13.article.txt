OnOd. 15, I lie Daily printed an
,ii iit le about ASSI -n first Sfiiate:
"Students will voif I bursday and Friday
foi ( andidates l<>i tbe student Senate, a new
legislative both tbat hopefully will provide
beitei campus representation and also
'more thoughtful student government.
" I be 10-inember Senate was approved
b\ the student bod\ last spring in a referen
dum to replace tbe 1 .egisl.Ulire (I .ASSI ).
I be Senate membership is intended to rep
resent students in proportion to (be si/e of
(licit uii<lei graduate and graduate s< bools.
" I lie old I .ASSI was an amorphous
mass <>l more than I 10 members, elec ted ac
cording to residences or petitions from off
i am pus students, attendance was spot! v,
and \oling i redeniials rareK Â» bet ked.
I .ASSI often was dominated by strong per
se malities or members who weie masters ol

Bottom Line: Hard to believe, but today's ASSU
provides more thoughtful student government.
