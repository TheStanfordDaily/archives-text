It is blamed as a prime cause of
cancer and has been responsible for
millions of deaths across the globe.
Hut now scientists have discovered
how to use tobacco to save lives.
The transformation has been car
ried out b\ the Calif ornian biotechnol
ogy company, Large Scale Biology
Corporation, whose scientists have
created tobacco plants that churn out"
chemicals that protect against
leukemias and lymphomas. "It is a
neat concept," said project scientist,
Dr Ronald Lei>y, of Stanford Univer
sity Medical Centre. "It is the medical
equivalent of beating swords into
ploughshares, a very satisfactory ex
perience for a doctor."
The corporation says its technique
is particularly useful for dealing with
leukemias and lymphomas - which
occur when a single white blood cell, a
key part of our immune defenses, pro
liferates uncontrollably and eventually
swamps the body.
"The crucial point is the speed with
which the tobacco plant becomes in
fected and starts making bits of lym
phoma protein," added Levy.
