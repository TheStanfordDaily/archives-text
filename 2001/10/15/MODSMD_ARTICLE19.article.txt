## The 						Stanford Daily Coming Out Day is not just for queers this year 
### 
Published Since IS')I

Stanford will he celebrating National
Coining (hit Day on campus today.
I he day is an event ol great person
al significance to a number of indi
viduals who choose I his day to share theii
sexual orientation with others. Due to the
political nature of queer issues, however,
this day also functions as ;in important
marker of the progress made by the queer
community overall.
I he event had originally been scheduled
for ()(t. 1 1, but if was moved to Monday so
that the celebration would not coincide
with the one-month anniversary ol the ter
rorist attacks.
I he Stanford queer community Ikis < ele
brated a number of important vic tories in
recent years. I he LCB I Community Re
sources ('.enlcr has achieved status .is an of
ficial community center, and die ( enter < an

now boast of having a full-time director and
assistant director. These changes were
made possible by increased University
funding, a result ol student activism. Reno
vations to the Old l ire Truck Mouse this
summer have also helped the center ( rcatc
a warinei and more hospitable environ
ment for lis community members.
I liese recent events show the communi
ty's support for people of all sexual orien
tations. Discrimination against queer peo
ple is tolerated neithei by Stanford as an in
stitution not l>\ most Stanford individuals.
Yet the queer community at Stanford also
has challenges lying ahead. There are few
administrators or faculty members who
serve as visible queer role models, which can
make it difficult lor queer students to linda
mentor, both personally and acadcmically.
"Coming out" is more than a one-day

process, and support services need to be
iirmly in place at Stanford so that students
who do choose to celebrate their sexuality
on this day are well-supported in the days,
months and years to follow.
Some <>l these services are currently of
fered by the center, but a supportive atmo
sphere for queer people cannot be isolated
to one community center alone. In order
for the entire campus to be welcoming and
safe for queer people, the (enter's vision of
unquestioned sexual and gender identities
must be actively upheld by the Stanford
community at large.
II queer persons are almost invariably
the ones to make their sexual orientation
public on this day, then the assumption is
that only queer sexual orientation needs to
be made explicit. Many straight peo pie
have ncvci had their sexuality questioned.

Queer persons, however, may continue to
feel pressure to set themselves apart from
social norms in order to proudly and pub
licly embrace their sexual orientation.
It is in order to combat these feelings that
the center has made the concerted effort to
encourage people of all gender and sexual
orientations to come out this year. For ex
ample, the center has posted fliers about
the day in dorms across campus. In contrast
to previous years, Stanford's events are
being framed as a celebration for .ill com
munity members. We view this as a positive
and important step in making the day rele
vant for everyone.
For this reason, Stanford's National
Coming Out Day 2001 serves a reminder of
the struggles that the Stanford community
still faces and as a celebration of those that
we have overcome.
