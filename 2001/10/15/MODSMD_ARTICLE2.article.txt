# Chem-Bio building site gains approval
## Santa Clara officials clear proposed site on Roth and Campus 
### ANTHONY HA 
The County Manning Office of
Santa Clara issued an Architectural
and Site Approval 1 hursda\ for the
proposed Chemistry / Biolog\
Building at the intersection of Roth
Way and Campus Drive West. I lie
approval occurred at the end of a
public hearing held in ihe Countv
Covcrnment Center, and no objec
tions were made.
When completed, the building
will include new research laborato
ries for the Departments of Chem
istry and Biology, laboratorv sup
port spaces, chemical stores, offices
and conference and administrative
support rooms.
Officials cited several reasons for
construction of the new facility, in
cluding a county-mandated request
from the fire marshal for better fa
cilities to accommodate svnthetic
chemistry experimentation.
"The decision was the end of a
long, drawn-out process," ex
plained Jay Cross, facilities coordi
nator for the School of I lumanities
and Sciences. "The initial idea was
to renovate [the Mudd chemistry
building]. However, it was decided
that that was too costly and
wouldn't meet the needs of syn
thetic chemistry. So, about three
years ago, we concluded that a new

building was needed."
In preparation for t he hearing,
Capital Planning and Management
at Stanford submitted several docu
ments to the county, including ar
( hitectural plans, landscape and site
work plans and an air- and health
risk screen.
According to project manager
Wayne Kelly, much care has also
been taken to ensure that the
building blends into the surround
ing campus.
"('.hem-Bio will be (aiefully inte
grated into the campus fabric,"
Kelly said. "We worked hard to
make it meet Stanford standards for
its core campus, from a design
standpoint, the building will be a
good neighlx)! ."
Kelly further explained that the
count v's approval is only condition
al <»nd that there is a 15-day waiting
period belore it takes effect.
" I here is still more documenta
tion that we need," be said. "If we
are fortunate enough to get ail our
permits tight awav, construction
should begin tight before the end
of the calendar year. If there area
few delays, which is more likely,
then it will start .it the beginning of
next year."
Carol Killiati, facilities manger
for the Department of Biological
S< ienc es, said she has had input into
the project since its inception, and
she < ited advantages and disadvan
tages to the new building.
"Well, it's moving four Biology
professors out of the department,
so i! will be less efficient than hav
ing everyone in the same build
ing," she said. "At the same time,
everyone in C'.hem-Bio is part of
the same discipline, so that makes
it more cohesive."
l he building process, whit h will
tost an estimated $(>•} million, is
projected to last until [unc 200U,
with the move-in occurring during
the summer and fall of the same
\ear. Chough Capital Planning
Management anticipates that noise
from the construction will continue
until fall 2002, Asso< \ ic:e Provost
of Lmd and Buildings I-ingston
I riggsaid that it is fora got kI cause.
"It's in the name t»f research,
whit li is what we do at this I 'Diver
sity," he said.
