# THAT SIDE OF PARADISE
## Boone's and Flicks do not a romance make 
### 
Somewhere between the gra
nola love of (lie HMOs and the
lusterless courtship, troweled
divorce courts and prenuptial
agreements oi today, most tilings ro
mantic perished. We now find our
selves in an age in whit li Byrony is
dead and irony is blooming. I'm sure

you've heard other
forms of this argument
before, such as griping
about the contempo
rary chivalry vacuum,
but I'm talking about
something more se
vere and encompass
ing. Honestly: why

have we allowed romanticism, in
many senses of the word, to become
an anachronism? Granted, we no
longer live in a dramatic time of ex
pectant wives pacing on porches,
awaiting their mates' return from war,
but does that mean that our lives
should be void of the earnest senti
mentality that guided previous gener
ations? There has to be some sort of
Neo-Romantit ism that we can (ou
tlive and perhaps even reinvent.
Consider first: when was the hist time
you wrote someone a love letter, or for
that matter, any sort of letter? In a Iric
tionless world of e-comnierce, evber-fi
nancial markets and fluid information
exchange, the very dialogue of love has
lieen subverted to the transient, intan
gible form of e-mail.
We've all seen letters that engaged
couples, and perhaps our parents,
have written to each other while they
were apart. Their words are written in
ink and their voices are captured in
delibly. rhus, their children have been
able to understand the concord, how
ever impelled, in which their parents'
marriage is derived, and forge their
own conceptions of courtship along
side or against their parents' prece
dent. If all of us do not begin to capture
our own relationships in more naked,
immortal mediums such as the
archetypal 'love letter, what will we
present to our kids? In that regard,
what will be our legacy?
I suppose I'm not just talking allot it
love when I say that Bvronic practices
have withered. Quixotic social customs
seem to have receded to the back
ground as well. I can't recall the last
birthday dinner for one of my fricnt Is at
which someone offered a toast. We wit

ness toasting at oui parents' tables and
parties, and we will certainly see it at
our weddings, so why can t we raise a
glass and muster a glib tribute to a com
rade right now?
Lastlv, .American relationships today
seem to have defected from the Kuro
pean model of post-supper meander
ing. I walk around the campus a great
deal at night, and vet each time that I
am out under the Peninsula moon, I
am surprised ;it the utter lack of Other
people. I here arc 15.000 total students
at this school, a great deal ol them live
on campus, and presumably a portion
of them are dating one another. Net a
walk from the Row to the Quad around
midnight invariably reveals little or no
life .it all.
I he arched forms and motifs of noc
turnal Stanford should invite persistent
exploration, and tlicv truly comprise a
romantic backdrop. At night, our palm
trees look like they could have been
transplanted from the French Riviera,
our fountains from Rome and our
art lies from (.recce. Net I see no lovers
or even friends strolling between them.
What has become of the moonlit walk?
Where are the echoes of an Austcnian
repartee? How about brie at midnight
on the Quad?
It isn't too late to salvage our genera
tion's and our school's romantic impo
tence. I'm not trying to write a trite so
liloquy here, but reform seems easy
enough. In order to resurrect the ro
mantic, you could go see a movie at the
Stanford I heater and watch a Cary
(irant 112 ilm instead of a banal Leonardo
didaprio orgy. Rent "Roman Holiday"
instead of " I lie Wedding Planner."
Sit down and write a letter instead of
a run-on, misspelled e-mail. Use the
term 'forsooth' in a sentence. Prepare
,md propose a toast at the next birthday
dinner, lake the train instead of flying.
Drink a Bellini instead of a Boone's.
I'm not asking fora resuscitation of"
decayed decadence, but rat her a redis
covery of its pretty cousins: the vin
tage. the tender, the lovely and the ro
mantic. Ihe fact that we live in a
strange, fast time does not mean that
we cannot experience and sustain in
more pure forms our friendships,
leisure and love.

life .it all.
I he arched forms and motifs of noc
turnal Stanford should invite persistent
exploration, and tlicv truly comprise a
romantic backdrop. At night, our palm
trees look like they could have been
transplanted from the French Riviera,
our fountains from Rome and our
art lies from (.recce. Net I see no lovers
or even friends strolling between them.
What has become of the moonlit walk?
Where are the echoes of an Austcnian
repartee? How about brie at midnight
on the Quad?
It isn't too late to salvage our genera
tion's and our school's romantic impo
tence. I'm not trying to write a trite so
liloquy here, but reform seems easy
enough. In order to resurrect the ro
mantic, you could go see a movie at the
Stanford I heater and watch a Cary
(irant 112 ilm instead of a banal Leonardo
didaprio orgy. Rent "Roman Holiday"
instead of " I lie Wedding Planner."
Sit down and write a letter instead of
a run-on, misspelled e-mail. Use the
term 'forsooth' in a sentence. Prepare
,md propose a toast at the next birthday
dinner, lake the train instead of flying.
Drink a Bellini instead of a Boone's.
I'm not asking fora resuscitation of"
decayed decadence, but rat her a redis
covery of its pretty cousins: the vin
tage. the tender, the lovely and the ro
mantic. Ihe fact that we live in a
strange, fast time does not mean that
we cannot experience and sustain in
more pure forms our friendships,
leisure and love.
