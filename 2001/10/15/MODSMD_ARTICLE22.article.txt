Friday's letters restore alum's faith in
student body
I 11.1 nk \t>ii for publishing the letters
you did on Friday, Oct. IL'. I liev re
stored m\ faith in I lit* basic good sense
of the student hod\. which was h,idl\
shaken as I walked to .1 reunion
roundtable at C'.ubberley Auditorium.
I lie graffiti on the pavement uniform
ly displayed the twisted thinking tli.it I
last saw during the Vietnam era:
"War? Not in ni\ name"; "(live peace .1
chant e"; "An eye for .111 e\ e leaves the
whole world blind!"
I wanted .1 piet e of chalk to add a few
codicils in the hope that education In
graffiti could open the minds ol the
writers to the new reality that we all
111 list live by. "Signed, I ma Coward";
"We tried, and it didn't work"; "Sure,
we got a lot more towers, and inavbc
Osama will get bored and goawav."
I nivcrsitics have traditionally been
these.it of fringe thinking that voices
idealistic, unrealistic and simplistic solu
tions to complex problems not vet un
derstood by the speakers. I am greatly
pleased to find that some articulate stu
dents (and I hope the great majority) see
the reality of our situation.
Our opponents are not warriors,
heroes and glorious spiritual philoso
phers. I hey are self-absorbed, clever
and conscienceless lunatics that will kill
us all unless we stop them. I here are no
good wars, but there are some good
causes that must be fought for.

Uncertainty is a valid response to
recent events
In lliursday's editorial, I lie Stan
ford l).iil\ expressed concerns ili.it our
student bod\ hasn't gotten sufficiently
"riled up" 111 response to the military
strike sin Afghanistan. I hat our levels of
activism don't compare to those of
Brown. Fmon and Berkeley seems to
c onfii 111 (lit* stereotype of endemic apa
th\ on campus. I lie wish of the editorial
board is that, despite their lac k of public
displav. out beliefs, whatever they may
be, be "passionate."
Firstly, the call to passionate belief,
wit h<>lll regard for the content of that be
lief, is a questionable tac tic. Political avicl
n\ in general doesn't exactly have a great
trat k record.
(>n the other hand, the apparent apa
tliv of our fellow students is worth ex
ploring. If their lac k of engagement is
the result of an intellectual indolence or
a callous disregard for events which ef
fect their society and the world, then
they may justly be criticized for, well, in
tellectual indolence and callous disre
gard. But if their detachment reflects a
lack of conviction that (a) student
demonstrations are effectual in such a
situation or that (b) they have enough in
formation and intellectual and ethical
acuity to be* sure in choosing the right
side, then I can't say I blame them. In
deed, I'm right in their camp. Frankly
admitting 11 tic crtainty in the face of such
a complex situation is a luxury that our
leaders may not have, but as students, it
can be our brightest response.
Nor can I criticize the student who is

unallotted by the implicit moral injunc
tion to be deeply informed about and in
terested by these unfolding events. Ac
tivists frequently seem to operate under
the assumption that every individual
should feel intimately invested in the fate
of his sot iety and species.
1 his ethical principle is interesting
and may be practicable, but is less than
clearly compelling. Personally, I'd be
happy enough to be surrounded by stu
dents with genuine passions of a more
local sort for their a< adcmic put suits and
social relationships.
But don't get me wrong. II the fate of
the I nited States, Western civilization,
humankind, my best friend or mv dog
clearly depended on my vocal presence
in White Plaza on a given day, then ex
pec i my participation or call me lazy and
apathetic. But in the present situation,
and, as you ma\ infer, in most, the sug
gestion that I ought to take a stand (first
requiring me to discover or manufacture
conviction) and that this act would have
any measurable impa< t on the state of the
world is highly dubious.
I hat said, I would encourage anyone
who has an interest in these matters
(and most of us have at least some) to re
search, discuss and meditate on the
facts. To anyone who has "impassioned"
beliefs, I would offer the same advice,
and then encourage them to rally and
proselytize to their heart's content. To
those who have neither interest nor pas
sion. I wish good fortune and serenity in
their pursuits.

th\ on campus. I lie wish of the editorial
board is that, despite their lac k of public
displav. out beliefs, whatever they may
be, be "passionate."
Firstly, the call to passionate belief,
wit h<>lll regard for the content of that be
lief, is a questionable tac tic. Political avicl
n\ in general doesn't exactly have a great
trat k record.
(>n the other hand, the apparent apa
tliv of our fellow students is worth ex
ploring. If their lac k of engagement is
the result of an intellectual indolence or
a callous disregard for events which ef
fect their society and the world, then
they may justly be criticized for, well, in
tellectual indolence and callous disre
gard. But if their detachment reflects a
lack of conviction that (a) student
demonstrations are effectual in such a
situation or that (b) they have enough in
formation and intellectual and ethical
acuity to be* sure in choosing the right
side, then I can't say I blame them. In
deed, I'm right in their camp. Frankly
admitting 11 tic crtainty in the face of such
a complex situation is a luxury that our
leaders may not have, but as students, it
can be our brightest response.
Nor can I criticize the student who is

unallotted by the implicit moral injunc
tion to be deeply informed about and in
terested by these unfolding events. Ac
tivists frequently seem to operate under
the assumption that every individual
should feel intimately invested in the fate
of his sot iety and species.
1 his ethical principle is interesting
and may be practicable, but is less than
clearly compelling. Personally, I'd be
happy enough to be surrounded by stu
dents with genuine passions of a more
local sort for their a< adcmic put suits and
social relationships.
But don't get me wrong. II the fate of
the I nited States, Western civilization,
humankind, my best friend or mv dog
clearly depended on my vocal presence
in White Plaza on a given day, then ex
pec i my participation or call me lazy and
apathetic. But in the present situation,
and, as you ma\ infer, in most, the sug
gestion that I ought to take a stand (first
requiring me to discover or manufacture
conviction) and that this act would have
any measurable impa< t on the state of the
world is highly dubious.
I hat said, I would encourage anyone
who has an interest in these matters
(and most of us have at least some) to re
search, discuss and meditate on the
facts. To anyone who has "impassioned"
beliefs, I would offer the same advice,
and then encourage them to rally and
proselytize to their heart's content. To
those who have neither interest nor pas
sion. I wish good fortune and serenity in
their pursuits.
