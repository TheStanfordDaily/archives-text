## The 						myth of peace: why America needs to bomb Afghanistan 
### MARK BOUCHER OPINIONS EDITOR 
Americans are si a red I lust- day v New
reports <>l anthrax infections, while not
explicitly linked to Osama bin l.aden
and al Qaoda. have t epeatedly appeared
in the news. It is disturbingly and con
tinuously evident that we are under at
tack b\ a savage foreign army. I here
fore, it is onl\ proper, and indeed net es
sary, that we are using force to cripple
the I alihan and capture Osama bin
1 .aden in Afghanistan. I he arguments
used in favor of peace, main on the
opinions pages of 1 he Dailv, are easily
refuted b\ the fat ts of the situation
I lie most pcrnitious of these argu
ments is that this attack is the result of
I S. foreign policy in the Middle Last,
sin h as our unwavering support of Israel
or the sanctions we have been enfori ing
against Iraq. I his perverse line of rea
soning is like blaming the viiiim of a
rape. No foreign polio is cruel enough
to warrant sut ha destruc lion of proper
ty and innocent life in protest. L\en if bin

L.aden's grievances were legitimate,
there are ample other forums for him to
express these feelings without killing
thousands of people. I here is absolutely
no justification for retaliating as he did.
Anothet pool argument is th.it vio
lent retaliation from the I nitetl States
w ill onl\ lead lo further retaliation from
the terrorists. Kin l.aden has said re
pealedlv that Ins objective is lo tlestro\
America. 1 licit- can be no clearer
promise ol future violence from him.
I'hese brutes are poised to wreak hu
ll ici havoc on I his count rv, i egai dless of
how we respond. K\ not retaliating, we
|) Li\ light into bin l.aden's hands. Ii re
inforces his perception of lis as weak,
soft and detatlent. Amcrita iniisi show
thai il is commitleil lo defending itself
against those w ho dare .itlack us and our
values. We must respond to a tin eat this
serious. When llitlei overtook western
Lurope, we did not stand it 11 \ b\ on the
grounds ili.it fighting hat k would onl\
lead to more \iolenie. I his situation is
no different.
We have tried the non-\ ioleiit an-

proach before, and by the peace-sup
porters' own admission, it has failed.
We could have easily marched into
Kaghdatl anil deposed Saddam 1 lussein
during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
Ibis would have been a violent ap
proach, probably causing man) deaths
and much internal unrest in Iraq. In
stead, we pulled back our troops and re
lied on economic sanctions to achieve
out objective of crippling the country.
Now, 11 aill children are d\ ing not be
cause we are withholding food and
medicine, but because Hussein is using
(lie aid money to line his own pockets.
Nevertheless, the pro-peace crowd sa\s
these sani lions are 11 uel and inhuman,
(lertainlv thev would sav the same thing
about sanctions against Afghanistan.
I herc-forc, there is apparently no re
spouse that would satisfy tliein.
furthermore, our military response
has been measured and fair. It would
have been easy for our forces to simply
level the whole country of Afghanistan,
killing many t iviliaus in the process. In
stead. we havccondui ted the sh ikes with

surgical precision, striking only terrorist
camps and other I alihan military facili
ties. President George W. Bush gave the
I alihan two weeks to cooperate and
hand over bin Laden before stal ling the
bombing. 1 hey ignored his repeated
warnings. Lven at his press conference
lasi week, he gave the group another
chance, lie said the bombing would
cease il they handed over bin Laden and
his lieutenants, hut again they refused.
We have hardly attacked without warn
ing. Instead til indiscriminately killing,
we have used our power against those
who are c learly guilty.
Another point made frequently is
that violence against Muslims abroad
will lead to division at home, as Muslims
and others are unfairly targeted for re
tribution. With a very lew isolated ex
ceptions, this has not been the case. I lie
few idiots w ho have responded with v io
leuce will be or have been prosecuted.
Objectively, one cannot honestly sav
that Americans have exac ted significant
vengeance on Muslims and Arabs in this
country. Americans have responded in

stead bv coming together. We under
stand that Islam is not the enemy, as
President Kush has said explicitly and
repeatedly. We know that our enemy is
a small group that has distorted the reli
gion. I'hose who predict vigilante jus
tit e as a consequence of military ac tion
are distorting the true American re
sponse to the atlai k.
Put simply, the Lnited States has the
right and the dutv lo defend itself after
the attacks of Sept. 11. ()hy iouslv we did
not wish this si enario upon out selves, but
we must now respond firmly, for those
who favor peace, I ask you this: how
in.uiv more vicious attacks on innocent
t iviliaus must we endure before it he
tomes appropriate to respond with
force? We are fating a new, savage
enemy. We must use all necessary meth
ods to swiftly bring I hem to justice, before
he sii ikes again with potentially worse re
sults. Acting with foree is the only way to
respond because n is the only language
that they understand. It is not only the
best way to defeat them, it is the- only way
to defeat them. ('.oil bless America.
