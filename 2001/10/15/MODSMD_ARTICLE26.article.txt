Residents survey damage caused by two days of riots that broke out after anti-American protests in Kano, Nigeria.
Local community leaders in Kano said yesterday that as many as 200 people had been killed after anti-American
protests sparked some of the most violent riots in Africa since the U.S. began bombing Afghanistan to try to secure the
handover of Osama bin Laden.
