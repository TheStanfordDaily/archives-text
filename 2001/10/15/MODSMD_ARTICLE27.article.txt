singers took tlie Memorial Auditorium stage
I>\ storm Saturday night for the group's 20-
year reunion concert. Ihe event was Fleet
Street's I 11h reunion concert since its found
ing in the fall of 1981.
" Ihe concert was an amazing experi
ence," said junior Bill Martinusen, a Fleet
Street tenor.
" I truly enjoyed working with so many in
credibly talented people. It was a pleasure
sharing music with new and old members of
Fleet Street and the Stanford community at
large," he said.
I lie cast of singers featured Fleet Street
alumni from across the U.S. and abroad.
Some are Broadway performers and one is a
comedy writer for the ABC series "Politically
Incorrect with Bill Maher."

Among the concert's highlights were classic
Fleet Street tunes like "Masochism Tango,"
"Dirty Golden Bear" and the "Stanford
I lymn Rap." A few theatrical segments added
spice to the group's repertoire. One, a pseu
do-modern dance routine entitled "Muscle
Feet," featured three Fleet Street singers gal
livanting about a dimmed stage to music from
the New Age group "Enigma".
Twenty years on Stanford's campus has
made barbershop, humorous tunes and red
bow-ties unmistakable trademarks of Fleet
Street men. But it wasn't always so.
"During its formative years, the group
tried such names as The Amoebas and The
Fetuses, yet none seemed quite appropriate,"
the concert program said. "Names like The
Steaming Manholes, The Tentacle Men, and
The Heff'alumps were similarly rejected."
"In fine democratic spirit, the conflict was
resolved; a vote revealed the least offensive
candidate to be none other than the Stanford

Fleet Street Singers, a name which evoked im
ages of London's finest yellow journalism and
an insane, murderous, singing barber. Ihe
name stuck and there was much prancing and
gamboling about," the concert program s;iid.
Fleet Street underwent a notable transi
tion in the fall of 1988. Early in its history, the
group had borrowed from or had been given
songs and arrangements by East ('.oast
singing groups, most notably those from
Yale University.
However, largely self-sufficient bv I ( .)HN,
Fleet Street began relying solely on songs
arranged or written by its group members,
songs of the public domain or songs arranged
spec ific ally for the group.
"What was most exciting about this re
union concert was the fact that 70 talented
people were on stage having fun," said senior
Edward Requeue/, co-producer of the event.
"And when Fleet Street's having fun, we're
pretty sure the audience is too."
