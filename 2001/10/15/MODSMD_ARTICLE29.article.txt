## Sloppy play erases dream for perfection 
### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford coach Ivrone Will
ingham does not look t<h> < losel\
at st.itisti< s that jump out ol the
l)o\ score.
While the media obsesses
about passing yards, rushing
yards, completions, s;u ks and
touchdowns, Willingham can
simplify college football into one
statistic — turnovers.
"I think the turnovet margin
will be the most important fiictoi
in determining the | Pacific 10]
champion," Willingham has re
peatedh said.
Washington Slate defeated
the (Cardinal 45-39 Saturda\ at
ternoon in .1 battle between two
national lightweights that tut ned
quickh into a grueling heavy
weight dogfight for l'ac-10 su
premacy in the sweltering Stan
ford heat.
But, the scoreboard operator
could have saved Californians
some energy b\ putting up a dif
ferent score.
Washington State: I (!i take
awavs plus a I >l< k ked punt), Stan
ford: 2.
"We knew tb.it Washington
State had an opportunistic de
fense," Willingham said. "II
the) get |turnovcrs|, thc\ (ash
them in."

How about downright deflat

Stanford's offensive jabs of 15-

Hut for the many punches
Washington State ahsorlx'd, the
Cougars delivered a shot to the
gut, a punch to the jaw and a
roundhouse to the head that
knocked out the Cardinal, mak
ing Stanford's superb statistics
look as meaningless as numbers
in .1 phonebook.
