## Sloppy play erases dream for perfection 
### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford coach Ivrone Will
ingham does not look t<h> < losel\
at st.itisti< s that jump out ol the
l)o\ score.
While the media obsesses
about passing yards, rushing
yards, completions, s;u ks and
touchdowns, Willingham can
simplify college football into one
statistic — turnovers.
"I think the turnovet margin
will be the most important fiictoi
in determining the | Pacific 10]
champion," Willingham has re
peatedh said.
Washington Slate defeated
the (Cardinal 45-39 Saturda\ at
ternoon in .1 battle between two
national lightweights that tut ned
quickh into a grueling heavy
weight dogfight for l'ac-10 su
premacy in the sweltering Stan
ford heat.
But, the scoreboard operator
could have saved Californians
some energy b\ putting up a dif
ferent score.
Washington State: I (!i take
awavs plus a I >l< k ked punt), Stan
ford: 2.
"We knew tb.it Washington
State had an opportunistic de
fense," Willingham said. "II
the) get |turnovcrs|, thc\ (ash
them in."

How about downright deflat

Hut for the many punches
Washington State ahsorlx'd, the
Cougars delivered a shot to the
gut, a punch to the jaw and a
roundhouse to the head that
knocked out the Cardinal, mak
ing Stanford's superb statistics
look as meaningless as numbers
in .1 phonebook.

But turn the ball over three

the result is simply a missed op

"I think we have .1 hell ola

Willingham said. "We have to

W illingham did not have to
prea( h ibis message to Stanford.
All the (lardinal had to do was
listen to the adjacent locker
room, where an opponent that
had the will to convert opportu

hooting, hollering and hopping
to .1 (>-() stall to Ihe season.


KEITH ITO/The Stanford Daily
Despite senior running back Brian Allen's 1 7-yard run, resulting in the Cardinal's second touchdown of the
game, Stanford's mistakes allowed the Cougars to improve to 6-0 and to enter the polls, ranked No. 1 9.
