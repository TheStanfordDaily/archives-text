The center was designed specif

the Alumni Association.
"One of the greatest features
of the Alumni Center is that it
provides so much space dedicat

Manning said.
Other highlights of the alumni

center include a spacious lounge

nice place for alumni to settle into
an over-stuffed chair and read
yearbooks, newspapers, alumni
class books, and books written by
alumni," Manning said.
Many alumni pointed to the
backyard as the most striking part
of the building.
