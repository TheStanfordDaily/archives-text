unison. A man Ix'at a wooden gourd in the far corner
and ( hantrd in a language lew could understand.
Not a typi< al night in San Francisco.
But lor the eight Stanford students in the crowd,
this hula show wasn't typical homework, either.
It was the lirst field trip for "Onipa'a! The Native
Hawaiian Sovereignly Movement." one of two new
I lawaii-fix used courses being offered this year.
Fhe other class is in I lawaiian language, which has
not been available since the 19705. Students call it
"Papa 'Olelo HawaPi." (Sorry, no pronunciation

on sovereign!) and residents of Hawaii, say they
wanted to hi ing sotnc aloha < ulture back to school.
1 lie University of I lawaii was the only place they
knew of that oflered I lawaiian studies, Rang said. So
why, she thought, shouldn't Stanford?
"I want to.show other people there's so much more
beyond Waikiki and palm trees," Rang said." Ihe ro
manticized images of I lawaii really obscure the prob
lems natives are having in their own homeland."
\'els( >n, who is nat ive I law aiian, said she wanted to
learn more about I lawaii's annexation by the U.S.
and the difficulties that soon arose. She asked Rang to
join her.
But bclorc they could get their course started,
Rang had to find someone who knew Hawaiian for
the special language course.

Officials with the social language program told
Rang they didn't know anyone, so she (ailed teachers
in 1 fawaii, then local Hawaiians in the Bay Area. And
then she tried 112 fawaii again.

who had grown up on the islands. As an added I* >nus,
she is a hula instructor.
TheiJaM, With about 18 students, is a mix of gram
mar and Hawaiian songs, with a little hula lesson
tossed in now an&Men.
"You've got to understand the language to under
stand the poetry fin hula]," said Uchiyama, explain
ing why she integrate* dancing into her class.
Students also choose their own 1 lawaiian names.
Senior Chris Maloney chose kamalirle, which
means "traveler," since he often visits South Africa
and lus family recently moved to Maui.
"I've been going to Hawaii asa tourist for 12 years,
and now that I finally live there, it changes my own
viewpoint," he said.
"Now I'm learning the language and culture and
meeting all these people from 1 fawaii, and it's making
I lawaii feel like my own home now."
Maloney even sends his class notes to his parents,
who lived in New York for 50 years and are eager to
learn about their new Maui home.

She said she wanted to Ijeeoine

times; some natives said being
"Hawaiian at heart" just wasn't
good enough.
"I started to really question how

as well.
"Most people that grow up on
the islands don't know inuc h about
