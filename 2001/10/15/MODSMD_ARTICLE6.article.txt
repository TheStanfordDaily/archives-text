why, she thought, shouldn't Stanford?
"I want to.show other people there's so much more
beyond Waikiki and palm trees," Rang said." Ihe ro
manticized images of I lawaii really obscure the prob
lems natives are having in their own homeland."

learn more about I lawaii's annexation by the U.S.
and the difficulties that soon arose. She asked Rang to
join her.
But bclorc they could get their course started,
Rang had to find someone who knew Hawaiian for
the special language course.

Officials with the social language program told
Rang they didn't know anyone, so she (ailed teachers

"Now I'm learning the language and culture and
meeting all these people from 1 fawaii, and it's making
I lawaii feel like my own home now."
