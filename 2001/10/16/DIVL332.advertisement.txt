The D. E. Shaw group is a specialized investment and technology
development firm founded by a former Columbia University computer
science professor. It was created to apply quantitative and compu
tational techniques to the securities business. Today the group
encompasses a number of closely related entities with more than
US $2 billion in aggregate capital, but the core of our business remains
the same: the systems and algorithms that move hundreds of billions
of dollars a year, and the extraordinarily smart programmers and
systems architects who build them.
As you might expect in a firm largely run by computer scientists, we do
things a bit differently from the rest of the Street. We wear jeans and
sneakers. We value technology over bureaucracy. And we see to it that
good ideas get implemented.
D. E. Shaw will be holding an information session on Monday,
October 22 at 7 pm in the Gold Lounge of the Faculty Club.
