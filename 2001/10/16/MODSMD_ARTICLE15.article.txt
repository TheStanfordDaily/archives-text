## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford Band presence at Oregon long overdue 
### 
Published Since IS l )l

This Saturday, the Leland Stanford Ju
nioi University Marching Hand will
be allowed to accompany the football
team to Oregon for the first time in 1 1
years, ending.m all-too-long ban on its pcrform
ing .it that school.
Alter the Band performed the controversial
Spotted Owl Halftime Show in 1990, the Uni
versity of Oregon's Athletic Department indefi
nitely banned the Band from performing in Ku
gene. The fact that the current Band members
were still children when the offending show was
performed illustrates just how overly protrac ted
the punitive measure was.
In retrospect, it is questionable whether the
Spotted ()wl show should have been an issue in
the til st place. The Band made light of a tense sit
uation in ()regonian politics; it made no definite
statement on the charged issue. But because it

even dared to address the matter in its w pic al
ly irreverent way, it was criticized foi speaking
at all. Kffectively, the Band was censored b\
those who did not make the effort to under
stand the message.
There are few ( rimes that justil\ an I 1-yeai
sentence. Certainly, any harm done must have
healed years ago. While the 1990 show certain
ly upset some, most reasonable people should
be able to come to terms with theii angel wit 1 i
in a decade.
Nor does such a long exile make sense as pun
ishment. I he Band members who performed
the controversial show have long sine e graduat
ed and gone on to pursue their normal li\es.
There is no reason that the recent Band should
be punished for the actions of a group of alumni
whom they have never met.
It's hard to believe that the people upset l>\

the hand could have such little sense of humor,
li ne, the Stanford Band is different from other
inarching hands, but it is that quirky unpre
dictability that makes their shows clever and
original. In any given halltime show, the Band
could pav u ibute to Atari, chide the I S( 1 Band
Director or make barbed statements about im
portant social issues. A spectator might witness
the bii th of a new campus-wide joke or the next
national scandal. I lie Band's entertainment
value depends on having the opportunity toper
fin in without excessive censorship.
()f course, the Band should exercise its liber
t\ i esponsihlv and within reason. No one wants
to see the I niversity associated with a group that
public l\ displavs egregious |>oor taste. And de
spite several well-known incidents, we should
appi eciate that. Ibr the most part, the Band does
provide wittv and scandal-free entertainment.

In terms of unduly limiting the Band's
performances, the blame falls almost entirely
on the administrations ol other universities.
I he Stanford Athletic Department has con
sistently fought for the Band's right to put
creative shows on the field. By helping the
Band, the Athletic Department defends an
an integral part of Stanford culture.
Because this weekend is Oregon's Home
coming. there will not be enough time for the
Stanford Band to perform a pregame or half
time show. Nonetheless, allowing the Band to
travel to Oregon and play at the game re
verses a decision that should have been chal
lenged long ago.
We hope this will be the beginning of an
era in which the Band is taken in good
humor as it continues the creative entertain
ment for which it is so well known.
