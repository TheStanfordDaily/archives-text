terda\ when 1 passed a billboard
carrying a gigantic bullhorn.
"I lello Peter," he said to inc.
I skidded to a stop and turned around
to fa< e a smiling man wearing .1 large card
board postei with a pit lure ol .1 caud\ bai
on it. I here was another poster on his
bat k. .tnd .ill sorts ol logos on his face.
"Did you just sav my name?" I asked?
"Yeali, what's up? You look lit, lean
.ind hungr\ Are you interested in buying
one ol those 111.mh chocolate bars you re
ally like?"

"I'm, not really. I
moan, inavbe. I low do
you know mo?" I said.
"li s my job. I know a
lot about von. I know, for
example, thai \ou once
tried one ol HM(I s buy
one-get-eight free C.l)
deals. Which reminds
me: I II bet vou want to

bu\ the new Radiohead C.l) for halt price.
Rolling Stone (ailed it, 'excellent.'"
lie held a copv forward and smiled
nicelv. I he billboards on his back trans
formed from an image of a (anch bar to a
pic t uif of the Radiohead album cover.
"Who are you?"
"I'm your friend. I'm here to let you
know about all the fun \on could be hav
ing. 1 help people find what thev want. I
also like girls who wear Abercrombie
and Fitch."
I le smiled again.
"Sounds like you're a product pusher."
I said suspiciously.
"I prefer to see myself as a story-teller,
like Dickens, or Homer, or even |csus."
lie paused, then told me, "I encourage
people to live their dreams, and then I
show them how simply they can attain
these dreams In going to the store. People
like my stories."
"You're not like Jesus!" I exclaimed
ridiculouslv. I wondered why I was talking
to an advertisement.
"No, you're right. I'm much mot e ex
citing. I nlike Him, I fill otherwise drab
public spaces with stimulating pictures
and thoughts. I sponsor free giveaways
and spotting events. I even provide you
with free entertainment on the I V and in
the newspaper."
I le was a good salesman.
I le continued, "And, after all, isn't life
boring when you're happ\ with what you
already have?"
I paused and thought about all the ways
advertising had improved my life.
"So, do you want this CD?" he plod
ded. "I have friends who say it changed
their lives."
"Wait," I said, still thinking about story
telling. "Maybe < ity bus rides are cheaper
because of you, but you also play on our
emotions and stir our insecurities to cre
ate needs."
He looked at me quizzically. "I.ike," I

continued, "You make people work (it)
hour weeks ;it jobs the\ don't like just so
the\ can pa\ lor .1 luxui \ (.11
He nodded thoughtfully, .is il he hat 1
heard what I h.ul said before.
"Here's a bettei wa\ ol looking at it: I

didn't even know about Ile cnuni iatetl
the last lew words with con lit lent enthu
siasm. "People are living with luxuries
tliev wouldn't eyen have dreamed ol
without me.
"Hut do vou think we're all better oil
out e we lintl these needs?" I asked.
"Isn't it sell-apparent?" he gasped,
"Hutnanitv is enjoy ing its blissful self-at tu
ali/ation! I mean, we're hevond satisfying
merely our basit material needs. Onlv now
have we been able to spend so unit h time
011 higher pursuits, like working on com
puters, or driving cars." As he spoke. Ins
\ike swoosh mohawk shook cut hantingh.
"I thought we were destroying our
habitat and making ourselves miserable at
the same time."
"Well, I suggest you reconsidci that
opinion," he said hi usijueh. I hen he tried
another pitch, "Surely, you'd at least
agree that we help each othei In buying
more things."
I le looked at me dramatically. "Yes, il
we weren't always wanting more things,
tlie cconomv wouldn't grow last enough,
and there wouldn't be enough jobs. In
deed, without ad guys like me, sotietv
would fall apart."
"So you're just doing your duty as a (it
i/.en?" I said, catching on.
"Tret iscly. And you would be too il vou
onh bought this ( I) today!"
"N't>. 1 hat can't be right." I resisted,
" 1 here's got to be a better way."
"Not really. L'nless you're willing to
talk about some pretty revolutionary
things. . he tapered oil. "So! Do you
want this C.I) or not?"
I checked my pockets, pretended they
were empty, and shook niv head sadly.
"Sorry," I replied.
"All ri-ight, but don't blame me when
the economy falls apart."
Bewildered, I finished biking to bum
bio section.
