Paly senior challenges Daily's use of
'queer'
I hi' editorial seen in vesterday's edi
tion is, franklv, offensive and quite
derogatorv. While I am normalh not the
type ol person to complain about sneli
trivial matters. I leel it neeessary to com
ment on vour word as the lorum in
which it was presented was meant to l>e.
shall I say, "enlightening?" I he editorial
constantly refers to ga\ s .is "queer," some
thing I have vet to iclentit\ with being ga\.
Ihe diction.ll \ defines queer as "()l a
questionable nature or ( haracter and sus
picious" and even as "a derogatorv reler
etic eto homosexuals." (i.us are not t|iieer,
of questionable c haracter, ot suspic ions b\
nature. It is heterorcntric (is that a word?)
to use such language. I leterosexualit) is
not normal, it's just common.

Student questions sideline positioning
Watching tlu- Stanford-Washington
State floothall game last Saturday in 00 de
gree heat. I couldn't help noticing that the
Stanford sideline was baking in the sun,
while 011 the opposing sideline the Wash
ington State players were nicely shaded.
The logic behind this set up eludes me.
Why should we give the visiting team the
advantage of shade, and subject our play
ers to the hot sun?

Transfers don't need old labels
I am a Stanford student; really, I am.
1-veil though the transfer student orien
tation constantly made me feel like I was
first and foremost a former Princeton
student, I realh am a Stanford student. 1
have the ID number and everything to
prove it. I've even been known to say
(.olio on occasion. I can't, however,
bring myself to sav FroYo just yet.
I his begs an interesting question: to
what degree am I a Stanford student sim
plv because 1 have officially registered,
and to what degree am I just an uninitiat
ed newbie? W hen I first arrived on c atn
pus 1 guess I was a bit of both; an official
Stanford student, and vet still ignorant of
the customs, rituals and lifestyle that
make Stanford unique. I low, then, to be
come a Stanford student—a real Stan
ford student — in substance rather than
merely in theory?
I wasn't born with this my-blood-runs
cardinal-red mindset; rather, it became a
self-imposed obsession after I read the
Undet graduate Advising ('.enter's trans
fer advising Website. "From your very
first day on campus, think of yourself as a
Stanford student rather than a transfer
student," it advises.
In line with this suggestion I forgot
the "former Princeton student" label and
arrived at Stanford full ol excitement
about my present and future life on the
Farm. But this excitement was quickly
lost when I was handed my transfer stu
dent orientation materials, most promi
nent of which were an academic advising
folder and a transfer student T-shirt.
Across the top of the folder was a label

that read, "Nicholas C.aton, Princeton
I niversity," as though I was registering
.is a representative of Princeton. Fur
thering this feeling, the back of the T
shirt prominently displayed each trans
fer's name and former school. The mes
sage was clear: first and foremost, 1 was
(and am.") a former Princeton student in
the eves of New I'nder'graduate Student
Information Project and the UAC.
I was astonished by how much empha
sis was placed on where I was coming from,
as if 1 was «i visiting scholar from another
school and not a true Stanford student.
I had hoped that the transfer student
orientation would help me hit the ground
tunning, so to speak, with my integration
to Stanford life. Instead, I felt failed by
NUSIP and the UAC., held at arm's
length, constantly classified as "transfer,"
rather than embraced into the Stanford
community as I had hoped.
I m often asked, "Where did you trans
fer from.''' I'm happy to entertain this
question because the students who asked
have consistently exuded an important
feeling of acceptance that was missing
during transfer student orientation: that
I in not only a former Princeton student,
but that I m now a Stanford student. They
don't immediately label me with "Prince
ton University," as the UAC and NUSIP
seemed so eager to do.
After 1 answer my inquisitor, he/she
inevitably follows up with, "Why?" This
I in happy to answer, as there's nothing
quite like bashing the Ivy League. Well,
maybe insulting Cal.
