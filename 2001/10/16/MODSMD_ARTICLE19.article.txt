### ERIK SPERLING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Stanford recruiters visit
prospective athletes, it can he diffi
cult to determine who w ill succeed
at the collegiate level.
If the athlete is living in a
dorm, he or she has to adjust to
loud patties next door the night
before a rat e as well as the repet
itive dorm lood and the inet eased
academic load that even fresh
man must face.
1 he pressure-cooker atmos
phere ol national-level collegiate
events far exceeds anvthing the
athlete has had to fact 1 dm ing high
school, and at a school like Stan

foul. top results are expected.
"It's hard moving to a bigger
team where evervone is national
caliber; there's not as much recog
nition." said junior l,indsa\ I halt
in remembrance of her own fresh
man vear.
"You can sta\ up late the night
before your race and no one is
going to tell \ou to go to sleep."
For four runners on the No. 2
Stanford women's (toss countn
team, however, the transition from
high school to collegiate running
has been relative!) eas\.
Freshmen Alicia ( raig, Anita
Siraki, |eane (iofl and Sara Bei
have almost seainlessh made the

of talent in the team as a ke\ fat
tor in their success on the colle
giate level.
"In high school I usualU ran l>\
myself," said Siraki. "Now there is
always a group to run with. It
makes it casv to stav lonised in
workouts. You're reall\ motivated
to slit k with the pat k."
fliese i tinners also benefit from
being able to train with their team
mates d.iilv, a welcome change
from high st hool when the\ were
often forced to run with their male
teammates in ortlei to find laster
training partners.
"It's really ext iling to be able to
work nut with the same people
you rate with. Ii builds .» cama
raderie amongst you when vou
are both in the middle of a gi tid
ing workout—it's like a mutual
respect," s.iitl Bei, l.ist veai's high
school national champion.
"I enjoy it so tntit h more than in
high school because it isn't as haul
to run last when you have a group
of women running around \oii.
You can just stick in .1 pack and
feed off of each other's energx
