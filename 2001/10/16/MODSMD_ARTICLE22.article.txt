First-war head coach Bret Simon wants
to "build the perfect beast" — to create a
men s soccer program "that is so impressive
its scar)' to opponents.
I lis approach to teaching this lo!t\ goal is
to improve upon every facet of the pre >grani,
from performance on the field to communi
ty on treat h.
Winning games isn't something new to
Simon. Prior to this season, Simon spent
eight vcars at Creighton I niversit) —six as
the Bluejayshcaclcoac h. In liissix years lead
ing Creighton, Simon recorded .1 .7(i7 win
ning percentage and was nominated for the
Coach of the Year award lour times. Mis
overall record was 9(v2(>-9 — the most wins
fora soccer coach in school history.
111 his last vear at Creighton. Simon led
the Blueja\s to (licit most suec cssful season
in school history. The team not only set a
school record with 22 wins in a single sea
son, but also advanced to the NCAA
Championship game for the first time in
school history — becoming the only
Creighton team of am sport ever to make
an NCAA finals appearance.
Before coaching, Simon attended the
University ol Massachusetts at Amherst,
graduating in 1980. After college he played
professional lor the Nashville Diamonds in
die American Soccer League in 1982 and on
the international level in 1981.
Now on the sideline instead of the
field, success has not been hard for Simon
on the Farm. Working with the already
talented and deep team that he inherited
from his predecessor Bobby (.lark, Simon
has led the Cardinal to a 9-0-1 record.
The season began with nine straight wins,
tying the Stanford record for the best
start in school history.
Simon not only wants his teams to be
tough on the field, but he strives to have
his players be good role models off the
field as well.

While at Creighton, the Bluejays
spent main hours engaged in comniuni
t\ service, meeting with children iti the
()maha area and working in various out
reach programs. Simon has continued
this tradition .it Stanford, as the team
woi ks hard not only to promote soccer in
the communit v. hut also to volunteer and
work in philanthropy.
"Coach Simon wants us to have an out
w ardh good image to the commit nit) and
to help the community," said senior
I ravis |antes. "Bret has cracked clown 011
us about this and he really wants us to be
positive role models. We do things such as
visit local children's hospitals and work
with children in the area. We are more lo
cused this vear on public relations and
helping out off of the field."
In addition to the team's play 011 the field
and in the communitv, Simon feels that his
plavcrs also need to Ix 1 pcrsonalh developed
and focused 011 school.
"Not only do I want the team to play ex
citing soccer, but 1 want there to Ik- a good
atmosphere in the stadium and in the com
munity," Simon said. "Part of our job is to
have an impact 011 the community and part
of our job is to improve as a soccer team. But
<11 the same time, the team needs to grow as
people and as students."
"School is one of [Simon's] primary
goals," |ames said. "School is number one,
soc c er is numlxrr two and social life is a dis
tant three. He knows that the reason we
came to Stanford was because of both soccer
and academics."
Another method Simon hopes to use to
build his "perfect Ix'ast" is to attract the na
tion's top recruits. Simon said he realizes that
with the combination of academic and ath
letic excellence, Stanford has the ability to
draw very talented recruits. I lesaid he hopes
to "make Stanford the place that the most
talented high school players wants to play."
Corrting to Stanford was a big change
not only for Simon, but also for the Cardi
nal, w ho had been playing under the gifted

hand of Hobbv (.lark. In his four years on
the Farm, ( lark transformed a soccei pro
gram that hadn't experienced a winning
season in four years. While head coach,
Clark led the Cardinal t<» a 53-18-11
record and three consecutive N( AA tour
nament appearances, including the
team's 1998 appearance in the National
(championship mate h.
Hie change in coaches brought with it a
change in style for the CCardinal.
"Simon is a lot more ollensive-oriented,"
|ames said, "lie- gives the players the free
dom to Ik- more creative and more ollensive
oriented than (Hark did."
Simon also uses the great depth that the
(Cardinal possesses this year.
" The whole team works ven hard and
they all deserve to get into the games,"
Simon said. "I know that whoever goes in
will get the job clone. Some coaches believe
that players need to get used to playing full
games and there are others who believe
that it is better to get some of'the other guys
game experience."
Ihe adjustment period seems to have
been rather short, as the Cardinal did not
skip a beat in its early season play — winning
nine straight games before losing its first
game to U CIA on Sunday.
"Every team is different, whether it's sim
ply a new season or a new school," Simon
said. "There were no adaptations for me on
how I looked at the game. Soccer itself never
changes, but I did notice tli.it .it Stanford the
players have very high expectations and
work very hard. On their side of it, I hope
that they haven't had to adapt to me too
much, because Bobby Clack is one of the best
coaches in the country."
Despite only being 10 games into his
first season on the Farm, Simon said lie
feels that "lots of pieces are in place. I low
ever, we're not all the way there yet.
There are still some cracks and we need to
put all the pieces together to make some
thing that other schools are scared of —
the "perfect beast."
