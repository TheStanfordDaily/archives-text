the development and implementa

gram, team-teaches a humanities
course at East Palo Alto High
School. Ile is currently working
with students on a collaborative
project with a school from Brazil in
which the students research the
African influences in both regions.
"The students are being ex
posed to many theories, practices
and intellectually stimulating op
portunities," Keys said. I wish I
had been at their age."
Haydee Rodriguez, another
STEP participant, said she was
drawn to the program because she
had previous experience teaching
and an interest in the professional
development that the charter
school experience would provide.
Darling-Hammond said there
were many areas in which Stanford
students and faculty could help the
schcxil. In paiticular, she is looking
for internship, community service
and mentoring opportunities for the
East Palo Alto I ligh Schcxil students.
They said they will soon look for
tutors and lx>ok donations appro
