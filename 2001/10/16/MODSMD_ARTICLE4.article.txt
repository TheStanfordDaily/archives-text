# Three fraternities apply for housing
## Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Psi vie for row houses 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM 
I'liree of Stanford's fraterni
ties have submitted applications
for Row houses to the Greek
Housing Review Committee,
whit li will begin to review the
proposals this week.
Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon
and Phi Kappa Psi have all com
piled bids to become housed, and
Director of Residential Education
|ane (lamarillo will likelv decide in
January which of the fraternities, if
any, will be awarded a house.
I laving submitted lengthy writ
ten reports on ()ct. 5, the fraterni
ties will meet with the Greek
Housing Review Committee in
the upcoming weeks to present
their reasons for why they feel
the\ should be given a house.
I he committee is comprised of
six administrators and six stu

programming and community

demonstrate how the Stanford
community would benefit from

their receiving a house.
At this point, administrators
said it is premature to speculate
whether any of the fraternities will
be given a house.
"The decision hasn't been
made if we will award one house
or if we will award any houses,"
saitl Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe, who co-chairs the
committee. "We won't be award
ing more than two."
"It's an open process, and at
this point ;ill chapters who are
applying are on equal footing,"
she said.
Thus far, the committee has
only met once. 11 it* Row houses
under consideration to be con
verted into fraternity houses are
Mars (553 Mayfield), 557 Mayfield
and 592 Mayfield (the old Delta
Kappa Epsilon house).
In accordance with revisions
made to Greek housing proce
dures last year, the committee an
nounced before the Draw last
spring that these houses may be
come fraternity houses for the
2002-2003 year.
The committee wanted to en
sure that students drawing into
those houses were aware of the
possibility that the residences
might become Greek.
File changes also dictated that
roughly 25 percent of houses on
