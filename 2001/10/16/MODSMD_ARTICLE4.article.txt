# Three fraternities apply for housing
## Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Psi vie for row houses 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM 
I'liree of Stanford's fraterni
ties have submitted applications
for Row houses to the Greek
Housing Review Committee,
whit li will begin to review the
proposals this week.
Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon
and Phi Kappa Psi have all com
piled bids to become housed, and
Director of Residential Education
|ane (lamarillo will likelv decide in
January which of the fraternities, if
any, will be awarded a house.
I laving submitted lengthy writ
ten reports on ()ct. 5, the fraterni
ties will meet with the Greek
Housing Review Committee in
the upcoming weeks to present
their reasons for why they feel
the\ should be given a house.
I he committee is comprised of
six administrators and six stu
dents, including Greeks and non-
Greeks. Po be considered fora
house, the fraternities must meet
stringent criteria involving mem
bership requirements, campus
programming and community
set vice. The fraternities must also
demonstrate how the Stanford
community would benefit from

their receiving a house.
At this point, administrators
said it is premature to speculate
whether any of the fraternities will
be given a house.
"The decision hasn't been
made if we will award one house
or if we will award any houses,"
saitl Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe, who co-chairs the
committee. "We won't be award
ing more than two."
"It's an open process, and at
this point ;ill chapters who are
applying are on equal footing,"
she said.
Thus far, the committee has
only met once. 11 it* Row houses
under consideration to be con
verted into fraternity houses are
Mars (553 Mayfield), 557 Mayfield
and 592 Mayfield (the old Delta
Kappa Epsilon house).
In accordance with revisions
made to Greek housing proce
dures last year, the committee an
nounced before the Draw last
spring that these houses may be
come fraternity houses for the
2002-2003 year.
The committee wanted to en
sure that students drawing into
those houses were aware of the
possibility that the residences
might become Greek.
File changes also dictated that
roughly 25 percent of houses on
the Row c 01 ild be (ireek. (airrent
ly, Stanford has 30 Row houses in
cluding five fraternities and three
sororities.
Members of each homeless
fraternity said they are optimistic
about their c hances of receiving
housing.
In 1901, Sigma Nil admitted
the first black member to the na
tional c hapter and cjiiickh lost its
charter. I'welve years later the
fraternity lost its house because it
could no longer afford it. I lowev
er, members of the 54-man fra
ternity said they believe their
group is ready to be housed and
assume the challenges of new
programming.
"We're well-known on cam
pus," said Sigma Nu senior Adam
Marchick. "I think both the cam
pus and the Greek system know
we're ready fora house."
"Getting a house has always

been .1 discussion among us, and
for some of the activities we want
to brain h into, we could really use
a house," Marchick said, citing
community service initiatives as
well as all campus events that
would "benefit all of Stanlbrd."
Brotheis in Stanford's oldest
fraternity, Phi Psi, which lost its
house in 1970 due to a drop in
membership, also said they feel
qualified for a house.
" I lie way you get a house is
you meet the criteria," said Phi
Psi President Chris Mont
gomery, a senior. "I feel like we
meet the criteria."
Last year, Montgomery served
as Intel fraternity Council Presi
dent and was involved in the revi
sions to the Creek housing
process. He said he believes at least
one chapter will gain housing.
"I think there's a strong pos
sibility for a Creek organization
to be housed this time through,"
he said.
The third fraternity, Sig Kp,
has never been housed at Stan
ford. "Basically we feel that we

could benefit from having a house
as an organization," said Sig Kp
President Jell kcltncr, .1 senior.
"We also feel we could benefit the
campus In having a house."
Still, despite last year's revi
sions to the process made to min
imize backlash among the non-
Creek student population, many
students feel strongh that Creek
organizations should not be
awarded any more Row houses
because suc h actions would limit
premier housing options for
other students.
"I don't want to join a fiat. If
they all get housed, there's no
nice housing left for me," said
sophomore David Kale, who
lives in Adams. "Why the hell do
we need so many fiats housed
anyway?"
Emily Livadary, a sophomore
who resides in (>8() Komita, said
"I'm sort of opposed to [housing
another fraternity] just because
housing is already so light as it is."
"The Draw is already so com
petitive," she said. "I think since
they're not building any more

houses right now they shouldn't
make it any more competitive
than it already is."
l.ivadary added that some Row
houses can still be social venues for
fraternities without housing them.
"I know ").")? hosts parties for
.1 lot o! frats, <iihI I think that's a
good compromise," she said.
" I hat's better than keeping .">()
people out of having good
housing."
Members of fraternities 11 \ mg
to obtain housing argue th.it
much of the student backlash
arises from misconceptions
about the process.
Montgomen noted that all
the houses undci consideration
were originalh fraternity hous
es. "I think that's one thing this
campus kind of loses sight of."
he said. "Something like- SO per
cent of the Row houses were
built by Greeks."
I le added that while many stu
dents feel giving housing to frater
nities will increase housing short
ages. in realit) more people are
likely to live in the house if it were

run In a fraternity than it it were
simph a normal part of the draw.
" riicrc's a common misconcep
tion that this would increase the
housing problem, and this is com
pletely false." Montgomery said.
Sigma Nu's Marc hick empha
si/ed that fraternities were not re
ceiving the most popular Row
houses.
" I he best housing is still avail
able." he said. "The University is
carefully not giving away the best
housing to the Greek organiza
tions." he added, pointing to
populat Row houses suc h as Hob
and Xanadu.
So far, the fraternities' mem
bers sa\ tliev have received only
positive feedbac k from students,
but tlie\ noted tli.it students are
not vet aware that these proposals
are under consideration.
"I think most people just don't
know that the process is going on
right now, that there are three
bids in," keltnet said. "1 think if
students were hearing more of
that, we'd probably be hearing
more of the negatives."
