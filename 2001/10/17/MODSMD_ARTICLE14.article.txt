## The 						Stanford Daily Consider other options for Greek housing 
### 
Tlircr fraternities: Sigma Nn, Sigma
Phi Kpsilon and Phi l\i, are applying
to move theii members into existing
Row houses beginning next fall.
Adding to the stork ol (ireek housing is perpet
ually unpopular because it is seen as unfairly
closing some of the best housing on campus.
Nevertheless, (.recks do provide benefits for
campus life. We feel that expanding the houses
considered fbi fraternities would solve the ex
i lusi\ ii\ problem and keep the six ial benefits.

Most students gain access to the Row for one
year through the Draw — if they are lucky.
Being in a housed fraternity, though, automat
ically guarantees three years oft he best housing
on ( ampus based solely on subjective criteria.
Since housing is such a significant part of the
Stanford experience, this situation is unfair.
A solution is to expand the range of houses
that are considered for (ireek groups. 'I'hey am
host parties and programs just as well in houses
that are not among the most popular on campus.
I Intraditional solutions like these would lead to
a fairer distribution of housing. Other housed
groups function in a dorm in a large complex,
such .is the African-American theme dorm in
Ujamaa. Fraternities could its well.
Also, fraternities do not necessarily deserve
special housing over other groups. I here could
be other (ampus groups that have the mem
bership to fill a small Row house and the desire

to live together. What they contribute to the
campus might be equal to — or more than —
what the fraternities contribute. But these
groups are effectively shut out from living in
Row houses.
Greek groups unquestionably do contribute
to campus life, especially filling a need in the so
cial area. For students who find Palo Alto too
expensive and San Francisco too distant, 112 rater
nity parties are often the main soti.il option on
weekend nights. Although not all students enjoy
the fiat party scene, some students do. Judging
by the crowds at most parties, (his numlxM' of
students is significant. Housing these fraterni
ties should increase the likelihood that they will
host parties, thus providing a spec ifi< benefit for
the campus.
The 112 raternities also improve campus life by
hosting community service and other campus
wide programming. Housing these fraterni-

tics will provide a stable location for these
events. When a group of people with common
interests lives together, it is reasonable to think
they will be more motivated to undertake
large projects. Often these projects benefit the
whole campus and community.
()nc worry about increasing (.reek housing is
that it will ultimately lead to Greek domination ol
the social scene. This scenario is highly unlikely.
Sum lord has not traditionally l)een a (ircck cam

houses to the (ircck list will not change that.
Increasing the numbers of Greek housing is

severely mitigates the l>enefits by reserving the

table system for everyone.
