## Benevolent distortion 
### 
Islam is I ><• il l l* distorted. It's not the
kind <>l distortion tli.it would normal
ly raise eyebrows. It's not at .ill nega
tive. Rather, it's a benevolent spin. It's
like hearing someone tell your Mom th.it
your little sistci is "realh nit e. peat el'ul and
loving" when you know the truth is some
what more eomplieated. It's iikc to hear
hnt, alas, it's not the plain and simple truth.
Over the past several weeks, President

(.eorgc \V. Bush base ailed
Islam "good and peace
ful." I Vspite 11 lis assertion,
I would bet a pair ol I exas
Rangers tiekets that lie
couldn't name a single one
of the live pillai sol Islam.
Nevertheless. national
magazines have jumped
onto the patriotic hand
wagon by calling Islam

"pcac efiil" and "loving. 1 his has become .1
national campaign and, like most propa
ganda, it veers far from reality.
A fundamentalist Muslim in Pakistan,
Maul.llla Saini ul-l laq, shamelessK parrot
ed this irony in an interview with lime
magazine, lie defended the use of armed
guards at a gathering of religious Muslims
and added, "if I had an atomic bomb, I'd
display it, too." I wo paragraphs later, he
was quoted as saving thai Islam is "peaceful
and loving." Ii seems a bit contradictory to
me. Hut ii comes right out of the past
month's pla\book.
Since we are at a universit) of higher
learning, we should get the facts straight:
Islam is not inhercniK peaceful. It was
lounded ill thecriK ibleol war. I he Prophet
Muhammad commandeered thousands of
Muslims into combat. A famous author.
Karen Armstrong. sa\s he did this in ordei
to sec lire pea< e. 1 don't know win he did it.
Neither does Armstrong. Kill the lads
speak for themselves. As earl\ as (>22 A.1)..
Muhammad's followers look the Pledge of
War to fight lot (iod and his messenger.
I hat was onh (he beginning.
In (>2:i, some ol I lis followers pretended
to Ih- pilgrims and slipped into a caravan
from Yemen. I hc\ attacked four men and
killed one. \\ hen people worried about the
propriety of lighting 111 .1 hol\ month, a
verse of the Qur an (2:217) was revealed to
justify "war in the hol\ month. In <>21.
Muhammad himself led .'lOO men against a
pcac elul c aravan from (.a/a to Mecca and
killed up lo 70 people, lie did it for the*
l)oot\. Caravan leaders retaliated a few
years later and Muslims dug a massive
trench around Medina. Muhaniniad-thc
trenc h-diggei. Muhaniinad-the-pjrate, and
Muhanimad-lhe-wai lord are strange la
thers lor a supposedlv "peac elul religion.
Muhammad had do/ens of wives and
concubines, and almost all his marriages
were political alliances. I le must have had a
big heart to love so many women. I le mar
ried the daughters — A'islia and I lafsa —
of his two chief supporters. I his model was
followed by ( Kama bin I widen s family. Bin
I-adeii married hisown daughter to I aliban
head Mullah (hilar to cement their working
relationship. But that's .111 aside. I don't

mean to compare bin Laden to the I lolv
I'n >phct Muhammad was brilliant and spii -

They have another thing in common.
Neithei one shied awav from war. Muham
mad led M).(>()() men into battle at the (>ul(
<>1 A(jaba around <>'t(). At c<mling to st holar
William Montgomery W att, another expe
dition was about t( > be laiint lied against lar
awa\ S\ria when the I'rophet died.Altci Ins
death, the polit v <>1 expansion was tontin
ued. Muslims occupied Syria, battled lor
Iran and established base tamps in Iraq,
lunisia. I'gypt. cent ml Asia and north
India. I he\ did it all lor riches.
Vnnstrong cites the Quran (2:HK)) to
prove that Muslimscan only light in sell-de
fense. However, the subsequent verse
(2:191) entourages Muslims to "light those
| who light you | wheresoever you find
them Millions ol modern-day Muslims
think the\ are oppressed b\ the Lnited
States through our alliance with Israel. Per
haps that's w 11\ 83 percent ol Pakistanis told
the (iiillup Poll that tlicv think ol bin Liden
as a holy warrior. I Ic listens and acts upon
the Qur'anii injunction (2:191) that "op
pression is worse than killing."
Islam haslx'cn distorted In the president
loi political reasons and In Armstrong, and
others, betanse they want to read their own
values into the Quran. Many of these pun
dits are not even Muslim. At tnstrong used
to be a Roman C '.at hoik nun. I he president
is (christian. Many ol the Muslim commen
tators are secularists. These people read
what 11 lev want out ol the Qui an. That's not
so eas\ in Islam. The Qur an was a divine
revelation from (.od to Muhammad.
I here's les> room to interpret revelation in
the following way: "what (iod reaaaally
meant when lie said that to Muhammad
w as, 'give (lowers to your neighbors.' "
Muslims have nothing to Ik- ashamed
about. The ('.hristian and |ewish traditions
contain similar history. In the l>t>oks of
|oshua and Judges, the Israelites totally
wiped out a huiK h ol (.anaanites under the
guidance ol (.od. One example: " The Is
raelites turned back against the Ben
jaminitcs, and put them to the sword — the
cit\. the people, the animals and all th.it re
mained." (Judges 20:18). At least bin Litlen
isn't targeting our livestot k.
Violence is pan of Judaism and Chris
tianity as millh as Islam. It'sa sad fact of life.
We shoultl noi let our polit it ians and re
porters paper over this lad with a distorted
representation ol religion. I hey should
leave the "loving" and "peat cful" parts of re
ligion to the individual practitioners and
theologians who make it their mission to ex
perience the Transcendent. Otherwise,
the\ are giving us a modern-day version of
the (,i usades — more benign, perhaps, but
still unfaithful to the original history and
dot trine ol Islam.
