SCPJ is fighting Stanford apathy
We would like to challenge the notion
pin forth in theCXi. 11 editorial, "Analyzing
thestereot)|>eol Stanford apathy." 1 lie ed
itorial argues that in the wake of the events
of Sept. 1 1, Stanford students an* more ap
athetic than theit student counterparts .it
other prestigious universities. 1 lowever, we
would like to ( all attention to the great num-
Ixt of manifestations of student interest in
discussing, protesting and learning al>< >iit
the afienn.it h of the terrorist at tat ks tli.it .in
going on here at Stanford.
lhe Stanford (loniniunity for I'eat e and
| list ice (S( T|) has been at live since the da)
of Sept. 11. I'hat evening, with only a few
hours' warning and with very few people on
campus, al>out KM) people gathered in
White Plaza fora candlelight vigil to mourn
lost lives and discuss hopes and fears alx)iit
the resolution of this conflict. A few days
later, SCPJ had its first meeting and since
then, haslxvn working to establish coin retc
outreach, research, antl action projects,
such as a "1 late Free Zone" campaign, mul
tiple rallies for peace, tabling in White Plaza,
student research of long-term, sustainable
ways of preventing future violence and pub
licity for other campus and local events re
lating to Sept. I I issues.
Information about our projects and
core value points, as well as how to join
our lively discussion and announcement
e-mail lists, can be found on the Web site
we have developed at www.stanford.edu/
group/peace. Our largest event yet, called
"Hands and Voices: Reflections on Sept.
1 I", occurred yesterday at noon in White
Plaza and featured several performance
groups and speakers sharing their feel
ings and thoughts about the current state
of affairs.
SCPJ is furthermore not alone in work
ing to bring awareness and disc ussion ofrc

t cut world events tt) students. I here are nu
merous other groups wht» are active as well,
from anothei recently formed group called
NineF.lcven that hopes to raise money for
World I ratle ('.enter victims' families, to Is
lamit .tnd South Asian groups on campus
who have held a public discussion on bate
(i imes against targeted minorities, to mem
bei s of the dillerent ethnic community cen
tet s who have been meeting to put together
group statements regarding the attacks to
the Stanford ((immunitv. to the Senior ('.lass
presidents, who put on an event last Friday
titled "911: A ('.all for I nity".
I liese are just some of the many differ
ent events that have been put on since the
(|iiarter began. At the first meeting of a new
ASSI -facilitated coalition of student orga
nizations who are looking to collaborate on
furthering discussion on the attacks and
subsequent war, over 50 interested stu
dents representing a diverse array of cam
pus groups showed up. There is talk of a
Student Initiated Course in the winter, nu
merous ideas for panels and discussions
and increased dialogue in the academic
sphere. In fatt. the Oct. 15 article titled
"('.lass sizes jump following attacks" points
out that International Relations and Arabic
classes have sizeably increased in populari
ty this quarter.
Kflorts to raise awareness, keep dia
logue going, and demand a just resolu
tion to world affairs are not occurring in
a Stanford vacuum, either. SCPJ is coor
dinating with other schools across Cali
fornia through its membership in the re
cently formed California Schools Against
War coalition, as well as at a national
level through a student network orga
nized by Wesleyan's Peaceful Justice or
ganization. We have also been coordinat
ing with local groups such as the Penin
sula Peace and Justice Center, a Palo-
Alto based organization.

in small, tightly-knit student groups", in
tact, organized discussions and manifesta
