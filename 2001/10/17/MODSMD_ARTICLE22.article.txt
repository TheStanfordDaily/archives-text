# Free throws & Shaq
## 
### JEN TAYLOR 
Q: Answer Girl, I'm a huge lx>s Angeles Lakers
fan. I celebrated for days when they won their
second straight NBA championship last June. It
would be really cool if they could do it again, but

I'm worried. If
Shaquille O'Neal
doesn't start con
sistently making
his free throws, the
" Hack-a-Sh aq"
strategy might just
start to take a toll.
What is Shaq doing
wrong and how can
he fix his free
throws to lead the
Lakers to their
next title?

A: I set' why you might lx' concerned. Shaq actually
has lxvi 1 consistent, but consistently declining. I lis
free throw percentage last year was 51 |>ercent —
down from 52 percent in 19W-2000 and 54 |>ercent
in 1998-99. Asa big fan, you probably already know
that he has a new coach, Ed Palubinskas, that lie's
lx?en working with to improve his technique.
Hie problem on which they are working is Shaq's
tendency to throw the ball straight <it the basket. An
official-sized basket is IS inches in diameter, and the
basketball is only 9.5 inches. Obviously, this gives a
margin of 8.5 inches when shooting. I lowevcr, this
margin disappears because the rim ol the basket re
sembles a light ellipse from the perspective ol the ball.
Peter Branca/.io, author of SportSt ience, claims,
" That's why these guys miss so much. Because of
the sharp angle of the typical overhand throw,
there ends up being a much smaller window for the
ball to go in. The margin reappears when the ball
comes down from a steeper angle, and there is a
greater chance of the ball going in."
With that in mind, one might suggest that Shaq
shoot so that the ball comes straight down at a 90 de
gree angle to the basket. I lowcver, a shot like that is
almost impossible to aim. It turns out that the opti-

niiil angle lot
releasing the
ball is at about

I") degrees. At that angle, the margin lietween the
ball si/c and perceived basket si/c is still quite huge
and the depth is still 1 I times the diameter ol the

ball. In addition, at
15 degrees, the ball
approaches the rim
with the smallest pos
sible velocity from a
given shot distance,
litis means it won't
bounce very lar if the
shot bits the rim.
F.ven at an angle
slightly less than 45
degrees, the smaller
vertical velocity of

the ball combined with a little bat k spin applied by
ilit* shooter will cause the ball to Ixuince upwards
and increase the possibility of a successful shot.
Branca/io firmly believes thai the most effective
shooting st\le is the underhanded "granny" throw
because it tomes down at a steeper angle to the bas
ket. But, somehow, I can't really picture Shaq adopt
ing the granny shot, a la Rit k Barry. l.ook for Shaq to
begin perfecting his 45 degree release technique be
t ause, as Palubinskas says, "we're taking it away from
him and giving it to science."
