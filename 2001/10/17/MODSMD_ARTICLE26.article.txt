# Blood pressure drug may treat diabetes

C.I 11( A(.() (Al 1 ) - A widch used blood
pressure drug ma\ prevent diabetes in
people .n high risk lor the disease, .1

I lie preliminary research found that
patients taking an AC.K inhibitor <allecl
ramipril and sold .is Alt ace reduced their
risk of diabetes l>\ more than HO pen ent.
I lie tantalizing result was first ob

ously published study showing that
ramipril could reduce deaths, heart at

and people .it high risk for the disease.

I lie results "require confirmation be
t ausc of the enormous < linit aland public
health potential of these findings," said
the researchers, led bv Dr. Salim Yusuf of

Mt Master I niversitx in Canada.
Dr. Cluistophci Sautlek, presitlenl of
the American Diabetes \ssot iation,
agreed that morestiuh is neetled but s.iid

AC.K — angiotensin converting en
zyme — inhibitors blot k formation ol an
giotensin, an en/\ tne involved m regulat
ing blood pressure. I lie en/vme can
cause blood vessels and arteries to con
strict, but the drug relaxes them, keeping
blood pressure down.
1 lie researchers said the drug's ellet is
on blood vessels ma\ improve function
ing of (he pant rcas and retlui e insulin re
sistance. Diabetes occurs when the both
cannot produce or properly use insulin, a
hormone produced in the pancreas that
regulates blood sugar.
I lie study involved 5,720 patients 55
antl older with vascular disease or other
diabetes risk factors. 1 hey randomlv re
ceived either a plat ebo or ramipril for an
average of about 1 1/2 vcars.

Diabetes developed during the stuch
in 102 people in the rnmipril group, !V(>
percent, compared with 155, or 5.4 per
»ent. of patients on placebos.
1 lie patients reported that they had
been diagnosed with diabetes; the stud\
did not attempt to confirm that thev had
the disease.
Funding for the study came in part
from the Medical Research Council of
C.anada, the Stroke Foundation of On
tario .md several drug companies, in
cluding Altaic manufacturer Aventis
Pharmaceuticals.
Dr. John Buse, director of the diabetes
care center at the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Mill, said ramipril
might indeed protect against diabetes,
"but without the exact light study, it's
hard to take this to the bank."
lie said one possibility — which lie
considers unlikely — is that ramipril sini
ply made patients feel better, so they ex
ercised more. Exercise is known to help
prevent diabetes.
