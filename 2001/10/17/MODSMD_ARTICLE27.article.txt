# Anthrax is in the spotlight
## Scientists trying to take advantage of disease's toxin delivery mechanism to design an effective vaccine

Willi the news of recent anthrax discoveries
in I-'loricla, the word "antln ax ' invokes .1 spec ler
ol uncertain!; and alarm. A basic understand
ing ol what anthrax is. however, mav prevent
this specter Irom looming larger and hovering
(loser — now more than ever.
Anthrax, caused hv a bacterium called
lint illns anlhr/u is, lit si in fee ted humans who
worked with animals or animal b\-prod
iK is. Symptoms ma\ include cough, fever,
swollen nvmph nodes .uicl or weakness
111.11 eventually ma\ lead to death, 1 licse
sMnptonis ma\ appear in as little as 21
hours altei exposure.
\ quick look into historv reveals a forbid
ding portrait ol anthrax. Indeed, the tilth
Egyptian plague (c. 1500 8.C.E.) may have
been the result of anthrax. In the Middle
Ages, anthrax was deemed the "lilac k Bane,"
and almost complete!; annihilated the c.ittlc
population 111 Europe.
\loie recently, American inspection teams
tun overecl 8,000 liters ol anthrax spores in Iraq
din ing the 1980s. I his quantit; has the capac i
t\ to kill the entite human population ol Earth.
In .1 1 at her delayed but encompassing response
to the threat anthrax presents, Sec retary ol De
fense William Cohen declared in Ma\ ol 1908
that .ill I S. service members would receive an
thrax vac c inations.
"Anthrax is inexpensive and easy to pro
duce, and it doesn't require a lot ol sophisti
cated equipment," s.iicl Majoi (.u\ Strawder,
direc tOl ol the Anthrax Vaccine Immunization
Program Agency and Office ol the Arm) Sur
geon (.eneral. "Hue wanted toe reate the per
lec 1 biological agent ii would be anthrax. It can
be stored for long periods ol time and c an sur
vive in the environment for periods as long as
10 \ears."
Kvcii in the face of these grim realizations,
however, I nivcrsit) ol Houston biochemist
Steven Blanke declared, "anthrax is .1 very neat
bacteria, even though ii can be deadly." In the
|anuar\ issue of Collegium, Blanke explained
how anthrax works .it the cellular level. "This
abilit; ol anthrax toxin to enter cells is not well
understood." Blanke s.iid. Studying the phe
nomenon will teach us valuable lessons about
how the host c ell wot ks. ,uid how to deliver ther
apeutic agents into cells." s.tid blanke.
Sc it'll!ists understand the woi kings ol anthrax
in a relaliveb simple manner: the first compo
nent — the bactei ia cells — transports the second
component — the toxin — into the infec ted per
son's c ells.
Based on this nuclei standing of how anthrax
delivers its lethal "pavloacl." as it is called,
Blanke is Irving to target anthrax at the c ellular
level. In fad. Blanke is working on a method to
replace the toxin with a "therapeutic agent" (i.e.,
a vaccine). I lopefulK. he and other researchers
will soon be able to "reveal novel strategies for
antibiotic and vaccine design." in his words.
