Alter years of complaints of ne
glcction, (lie Pacific-10 Conference
is finally being noticed by the conn
iry. With two bona-fidc Heisman
Trophy candidates, two national
title contenders and the nation's
sleeper team, the Pac-10 is making
noise in the Fast Coast-based col
lege football community.
After the ninth week of the sea
s< in, only three Pac-10 teams remain
undefeated. Coing into last week
end's games, live teams had yet to
lose a game, but after No. 4 UCLA
(5-0, 2-0 Pac-10) faced No. 15
Washington ( 4-1, 2-1) and No. 1 ( .)
Washington Suite (('>-(), 1-0) played
Stanford (3-1, 2-1), two teams were
knocked from the upper ranks of
the conference standings.
In the clash of the higher
ranked teams, the Huskies trav
eled to the Rose Bowl to face the
Hi uins. I he I luskies were without
stalling quarterback Cody Pickett,
who was injured with a separated
shoulder. Pickett's replacement,
junior Taylor Barton, threw for
3 1 (') yards and a touchdown in bis
liist start in a Huskies' uniform.
I he statistics don't tell the whole
story â€” the UCIA defense ha
rassed him all day, sacking him
four times and causing two fum
bles. In addition, the Bruins al
lowed a measly 10 rushing yards,
dominating the Washington of
fense the entire game on their way
to a 35-1 3 victory.

" 11 ley were big and physical,"
Barton said. "They flew around,
mixed up their game. I hey plav at
a level of confidence you don't see
too many teams pla\ ing."
