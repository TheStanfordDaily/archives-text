# Three unbeatens remain in race to top of the Pac-10
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN 
Alter years of complaints of ne
glcction, (lie Pacific-10 Conference
is finally being noticed by the conn
iry. With two bona-fidc Heisman
Trophy candidates, two national
title contenders and the nation's
sleeper team, the Pac-10 is making
noise in the Fast Coast-based col
lege football community.
After the ninth week of the sea
s< in, only three Pac-10 teams remain
undefeated. Coing into last week
end's games, live teams had yet to
lose a game, but after No. 4 UCLA
(5-0, 2-0 Pac-10) faced No. 15
Washington ( 4-1, 2-1) and No. 1 ( .)
Washington Suite (('>-(), 1-0) played
Stanford (3-1, 2-1), two teams were
knocked from the upper ranks of
the conference standings.
In the clash of the higher
ranked teams, the Huskies trav
eled to the Rose Bowl to face the
Hi uins. I he I luskies were without
stalling quarterback Cody Pickett,
who was injured with a separated
shoulder. Pickett's replacement,
junior Taylor Barton, threw for
3 1 (') yards and a touchdown in bis
liist start in a Huskies' uniform.
I he statistics don't tell the whole
story — the UCIA defense ha
rassed him all day, sacking him
four times and causing two fum
bles. In addition, the Bruins al
lowed a measly 10 rushing yards,
dominating the Washington of
fense the entire game on their way
to a 35-1 3 victory.

" 11 ley were big and physical,"
Barton said. "They flew around,
mixed up their game. I hey plav at
a level of confidence you don't see
too many teams pla\ ing."

the first quarter as I ( I As offense
exploded behind the power run

ter finished the game with HOl
yards, a UCIA record, and four
touchdowns, lie now leads the na
tion with 103 yards per game this
season. After the
powerful performance, I CIA
looks like the team to beat in the
Pat -10, jumping past No. 5 ()reg<>n
(0-0, 3-0) in the national rankings.
"As I told the team, if you are
going to have a chance to win the
(Pac-10) championship, \ou have
to knockout the champion," I ( I A
coach Bob Toledo said. "We
knocked out the champion from a
year ago,"
Despite dropping behind the
Bruins in the polls, the Ducks did
nothing to harm themselves over
the weekend. ()regon continued to
steamroll over opponents, domi
nating California (0-5, 0-3) 48-7 at
Berkeley. I he game was all ()rcgon
from the beginning as quarterback
Joey 1 larrington led the team to a
28-0 halftime lead.
