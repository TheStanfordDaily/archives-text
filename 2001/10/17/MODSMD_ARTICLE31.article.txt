I here is no doubt that Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium will witness something special
this weekend.
I wo of the greatest and most recognizable
American athletes, John McEnroe and Jimmy
(lonnors, will duke it out like old times at the
Farm on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
I his match is only one of 17 scheduled sin
gles and doubles matches at the second annual
Siebel (lhampions tennis tournament.
Starting tonight, when two former No. I
players, (lonnors and Mat \\ ilander, play each
other, fans will be treated to quality tennis from
"old" but still spirited and competitive profes
sionals all weekend.
At last year's Siebel Champions tournament,
McEnroe, winner of seven of his own Grand
Slams, defeated Jose-Luis Clerc 6-2, 6-3 for the
singles title.
I lie tournament, which will last until Sun
day, is a stop for the Champions l our series,
the only professional tennis tour for players no
longer active on the Ass<x iation for Tennis Pro
fessionals (ATP) Tour.
Any professional tennis fan will recognize
most of the names on the Champions Tour, in
(hiding McEnroe, Connors, Wilander, Pat
(.ash. I lenri Leconte, Yannick Noah and Bjorn
Borg — players who dominated the rankings
and Grand Slam tournaments throughout the
1970s and 1980s.
McEnroe, who won the NCAA singles and
team championships for .Stanford in 1978 be
fore turning professional, will be joined by fel
low alum and three-time Ail-American Scott
I )avis (1981 -1983) at this weekend's event.
Rounding out the singles lineup are former

A FP greats John Lloyd, Cash. Leconte and
Petr Korda.
I here will also be four doubles entries at the
Siebel Champions, including the effervescent
twin brothers Luke and Murphy Jensen.
File proceeds of the tournament, which
costs only five dollars for Stanford students, will
go toward two causes this year.
Fhe East Palo Alto Fennis and Futoring
(EPA IT) program, a youth assistance organiza
tion that operates with more than 100 volun
teers at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium, will
lienefit from the proceeds of the tournament
for the second year in a row. According to Stan
ford men's tennis head coat h Dick (lould, hist

year's event contributed around $200,000 to
ward KPA'I Is cause.
"This is a very neat event lot the communi
ty," Gould said. "We are very proud to be able
to host the tournament again this year."
Also, in light of the Sept. 1 1 tragedy, officials
from the (Ihampions l our. Siebel Systems and
I .IWT I have decided to use the toui namcnt as
a way to raise funds for relief efforts.
Hie Palo Alto Professional Firefighters will
man the "Rally for Relief program, in which
fans can earn the opportunity to play tennis
with some of the participants in return fora $'2. r >
