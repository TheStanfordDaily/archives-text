# NCAA's new target: foreign hoopsters
## 
### 
The NCAA has really
outdone itself this
time. An organization
already renowned for
its outdated set of rules and dou
ble staudardsol punishment has
officially reached a new low of
unfairness and incompetence
with its unjustified crusade
against foreign-born college
basketball players.

()n | ul\ S, as |
the culmination
of a four-year
investigation,
the NCAA sent
out a memo
randum to all
its teams, iden
tifying 350 in-1
ternational stu-

dent-athletes with possible "eli
gibility issues."
Basically, the N(A\ was ex
amining whethei these foreign
(mostly Kuropean) student-ath
letes, who played on club teams in
their native countries, violated
any of'the organization's niles re
garding amateurism by being
paid to pla\ or by simply playing
with or against players that them
selves were being paid.
I lie main change in policy
with this new crackdown is the
strict enforcement of the clausc
that forbids playing with or
against those tli.it are being paid
to play. Most foreign players
that intend on playing college

basketball in the I nited States
knowingly choose to forgo com
pensation for their play to avoid
just this issue.
It is important to point out
that high s< hool basketball is not
the main source of competitive
play, and AAI ball does not
even exist outside the United
States, so the club-system is the
predominant way that foreign
basketball players learn and
fine-tune their skills. In fact, it is
safe to say that the vast majority
ol all foreign players ever dis
covered by college recruiters
were found on the account of
the club-system.
Simply put, this new and
overly strict interpretation of
the rules is not only ridiculous,
but also unjust. First of all, by
( racking down so heavily, the
NCAA is essentially punishing
these foreign student-athletes
for growing up where they
did, condemning them for
being raised in a society whose
norms they could not control
in the least.
As adolescents, they had
none of the same options that
American-born players had —
in the form of AAU ball and
highly competitive high school
basketball — so these interna
tional youths were just herded
like sheep into the club-system
