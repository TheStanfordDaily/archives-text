Retired Stanford t;u 11It\ and stall and
local senior citizens in search <>la new
plat e to live will have a new option in 2005
the 11\att ( '.lassit Residence retirement
communitv. t in rent ly under const rm tion
near the Stanford Shopping ('.enter.
In 1002. the I niversity applied for per
mits to build several projects, including
widening Sand Mill Road and expanding
the shopping center. One ol the permits

was to create a retirement community to
be built on the vat ant land at toss from Ar
boretum and Sand 11 ill Roads.
Stanford entered into an agreement
with the cit\ to develop the retirement com
plex in August of 1007, according to Diane
I lealey, managing director of real estate for
the Stanford Management Company.
I lealey saitl Stanford then condut ted a
nationwide search fora company to devel
op the project, whit h led to the selection of
II \ att ( lassit Resident !.
"I Ivatt was willing to tailor not only the

building but also the services to the out
standing t ommunit\l lealev said.
Stanford sought 1 Ivatt to develop the
retirement coininunit\ because "senior
housing operations are tjuite spet ializcd,"
saitl Larry Norton, director of govern
ment and t omtnunily relations.
"Wecontracted I Ivatt ('.lassit Residence
so they < an i un it and operate it bet ause we
don't have the expertise here at Stanford,"
he said.
Since the Stanford founding giant
prohibits selling Stanford land, Stanford

is ground-leasing the land to Hyatt,
I leale\ said.
Stanford derided to build the retire
ment house to generate funds for the Uni
versit\ and bet ause it noticed a need for it
in the community, saitl Jell Wachtel, spe
t ial assistant to the president and provost.
11 \att representatives said the location
was an ideal lit for the residences from the
(ompany's pel spet tive.
"[Palo Alio is j probably one of the nicest
plates in the country to build one ol these
communities, not only because of the

weather and the location [near] Stanford
and San Francisco, hut also because this
area is terribly underserved with this kind
of housing," said Barn Johnson, senior di
rector of sales lor 1 Iv.itt.
University oflicials said the I Ivatt fat ili
ty is also expected to alleviate the facility
housing shortage. As I lealev pointed out,
!i. r ) percent of the fat ult\ homes on campus
are occupied by retired lat ultv.
She said retired facult\ want to remain
within the .Stanford (ommtmit\
Inn often require additional tare
and do not want to live in single
lamiU homes.
"With the new community, they
can st.in a part of Stanford's com
niunitN and he taken care of. and
litis opens 111 > the homes lor new
lacultN with families." I lealev said.
When 11\.lit and Stanford
signed the agreement, ovei 120
people made initial deposits. ac
(()tding to I leale\.
I halt's Johnson said that there
are now over 750 deposits.
"It is just ,i stunning response."
he said. "It shows how ninth de
mand there is lor senior housing.
