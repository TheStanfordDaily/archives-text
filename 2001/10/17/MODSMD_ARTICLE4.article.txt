Retired Stanford t;u 11It\ and stall and
local senior citizens in search <>la new
plat e to live will have a new option in 2005
the 11\att ( '.lassit Residence retirement
communitv. t in rent ly under const rm tion
near the Stanford Shopping ('.enter.
In 1002. the I niversity applied for per
mits to build several projects, including
widening Sand Mill Road and expanding
the shopping center. One ol the permits

was to create a retirement community to
be built on the vat ant land at toss from Ar
boretum and Sand 11 ill Roads.
Stanford entered into an agreement
with the cit\ to develop the retirement com
plex in August of 1007, according to Diane
I lealey, managing director of real estate for
the Stanford Management Company.
I lealey saitl Stanford then condut ted a
nationwide search fora company to devel

"[Palo Alio is j probably one of the nicest
plates in the country to build one ol these
communities, not only because of the

weather and the location [near] Stanford
and San Francisco, hut also because this
area is terribly underserved with this kind
of housing," said Barn Johnson, senior di
rector of sales lor 1 Iv.itt.
University oflicials said the I Ivatt fat ili

housing shortage. As I lealev pointed out,
