With the recent inundation o!'anthrax
reports in our <ountr\ and (lie- in
tensification ol the bombing in
Afghanistan, national fright has reached a
fever pitch, li is timcl) to issue a rcmindci
that, while outside threats to out national se
curity loom large, there is also a subversive
threat in oiu midst that requires oui utmost
vigilance i<> ward off. 1 his d.mgci is the en
croachment on our lii si Amendment rights
— specilicalK. lreedom ol speech and free
dom of the press — ilia! tends to occui in
times of national crisis. If we can take am
lessons from our ignominious fling with \l< -
Carthyism, we must recogni/e that interfer
ence with these two freedoms in the past has
only damaged, not bolstered, oui countr\ in
the long run.
I his subject is particularl\ iele\ant when
one looks closeh at recent reactions b\ Ihe

hush administration and the public at large
to opinions critic al of c m rent I '.S. policy or
mainstream attitudes. < )n Sept. 28, the New
Yoi k Times reported several examples of at
tempt to stiile voices of dissent in the United
States. I wo columnists from Texas and ()re
gon were fired aftei overw helming public re
action against articles each wrote criticizing
President Ceorge W. Bush for his kick of
leadei ship on the cla\ of the attacks.
I he White I louse itself got involved in the*
< rossfire aftei a controversial "Politically In
correct With Bill Malier" in which the host
expressed opposition to the military action in
Mghanistan. White House Press Secretary
\i i I Icisc her denounced Malier, stating
"people have to watch what they say and
w ate h what thc\ do." which has ominous un
clei tones, to sa\ the least. (ii anted, we should
be sensitive to the nature of the crisis, but we

should not feel intimidated into silence or
live in fear that Big Brother is watching ev
erything we do and say.
Kqually worrisome is the fact that the Bush
administration is wielding its influence with
in the media circles, a practice which under
mines the fundamental principles of a free
and independent press. Currently, there is
debate over whether the censoring of state
ments of al-Qaida spokesman Sulaiman Abu
(> ha it hand Taliban leader Mullah Moham
mad ()mar was necessary for national securi
ty. Nevertheless, actions of this kind set a
dangerous precedent for future interference
ol the press by our leaders.
In the future, they may interfere solely to
serve their own aims. As a society, we rely on
the press for accurate, non-politicized infor
mation. If our news is to take on the slant of
a certain political affiliation, how can we crit-

icize propaganda in Islamic countries when
we are facing in a similar, though less ex
treme, problem?
()f course, our nation is under attack, and
our actions are necessarily constrained some
what by the crisis. National cohesion is an im
portant and valid reaction to our current
state of affairs. I lowever, we must not become
overly zealous in promoting unity, as it might
lead to the unintended consequence of
squashing dissent.
Instead, we must strike a balance between
order and liberty. While individual concerns
mav rightlv take a back seat in the interest of
national solidarity, the undermining of our
commitment to our freedom of speech and
the press undermines the fabric of our soci
ety. In doing so, it allows the terrorists a vic
tory more far-reaching than any they have
vet achieved through violence.
