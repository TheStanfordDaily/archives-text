and non-Americans alike have been
(hanged as a people. (>ill fundamental he
liels are shaken. We are !oi< ed to cope with
the idea that the unthinkable can h.ippen.
1 hex s.i\ ignorante is bliss, and I ian at
test to that lact. A month ago. the Middle
Kast was, in m\ mind, siniph a larawa\ aiea
of the world. Sure, 10 vcai s ago ins count i \
fought a <|iiick war over'there in an attempt
to get rid ol some gu\ named Saddam I lus
sein who oui leadei s thought was bad. but
other'than th.it, H was just anolhei region on
the globe.
Afghanistan is being run In a group ol
people that most countries don't even rec
ognize as a legitimate government'- I mean.
I'd heard about thedesti lie lion ol some an
cient statues and the ongoing oppression of
Afghan women, but I bad ncvci taken the
initiative to learn more. I'he Israelis and
Palestinians were two gn nips who had been
fighting lot a long time and the I nited
States supported Israel, but I didn't know
why. I was unaware that we still have an ex
tensive military force stationed in Saudi Ara
bia, and though in retrospect I can see how
that might make sense, I didn't know
enough alxmt the situation to sa\ whet bet it
was right or wrong.
In admitting my ignorance. I don't
mean to suggest that am ol these issues
are unimportant. I fully realize how pow
erful they are, and how strongly the\ al
fect many people. But to an ordinary 20-

something studenl going to woik at het
sum met intci uslup earlx on the morning
ol Sept. 11. these (onllicts didn't seem
important. I had xvork to do. errands to

M\ patents retneinhei where 11ic*\ were

I low will 1 tell m\ children and my

how was it possible loi something so ten i

I (an s.i\ that buildings and businesses
everywhere were evacuated, and that the

how (|iiiet and eerie it was to step outside
and not lie.u a single airplane living high

1 can tell them the stories, and read the
old headlines, hut how can I ever convex the
emotions ol that dax and these that lollow?
I* veil with the benefit ol the words I've
learned, there just aren't enough parts ol
the language I know to convex the magni
tude ol the pain, sadness, outrage and lear.
l'odax there are questions every where,
and I liaxc no answers. Instead, I have my
new xocabularx —blaring from nix televi
sion set. s( reaming from the newspapers
and appearing in routine street conversa
tion Words, words, xvords. Yet amidst the
hail of ihetoi K surrounding us these dax s,
I find nix sell returning to onlx one: appre
hension.
