Benazir Bhutto leaves a poor legacy
"Oncol the world's first woman prime
ministers in .1 countn tradition.ill\ domi
nated l>\ men, she is not just an intelligent
and charismatic politician, but epitomi/es
modernity, mdependem e. st\le and
hope." So wrote One World Knrope's
Hans /oiner ol Benazir Bhutto in 1907.
Indeed. Bhutto has tome to s\ mbolize the
West's hopes tor Islamic Asia. But in hei
two terms as prime minister, she onh shat
tered the hopes Pakistanis had for their
newh democratic country.
I lic I larvard and ()xforcl graduate ar
rived in 1988 1 arising the extensive bag
gage of our Pakistani hopes. She was an ed
ucated, liberal, democratically-elected fe
male prime minister who would save our
exhausted country from the tyrannies of
military dictatorship. But those hopes were
dashed as she submerged the country into
a level of corruption and lawlessness that
even a third-world nation like Pakistan had
not seen before.
I'wice dismissed from government on
allegations of extreme corruption, she has
todav lost credibility with the millions of
fbrmei supporters of her political party,
who all once cherished her. But after more
than two years of self-imposed exile to
avoid jail time for corruption, Bhutto still
has the audacity to seek conspiracy theo
ries to explain her dismissals. After her
egregious terms in office, complaints about
unfair treatment are not going to restore
Pakistani faith in Benazir Bhutto.
Bhutto comes from a prominent feudal
family, and her husband Asif Zardari is
himself a feudal lord. I he feudal system in
Pakistan thrives on the ideology of stasis.
I his keeps the serfs on their lands unedu
cated and in bondage for generations. The
ideology of Bhutto's regime was no differ
ent. She betrayed women's hopes during

both her tenures. 1988-1990 and 1993-
199b, when she, the liighlv educated
woman prime minister, failed to put forth
even a single piece of legislation on
women's 1 ights in Pakistan. Nor did she re
peal am of the previous militan regime's
severe restrictions on women.
Meanwhile, the economy soured as
Blmtto and her husband pilfered millions
of dollars from the near-empty treasurv.
I ler first tenure is surpassed onh In her
second in the unparalleled rates of corrup
tion and crime, as documented b\ over
whelming evidence put together In both
Pakistani and Western media. In 1999, she
was convicted of laundering 5190,000
from Swiss firms and sentenced to five
years in jail and a fine of $8.6 million tor
kickbacks that led to huge financial losses
for the Pakistani treasury.
I n all. she and her husband are charged
with embezzling $100 million from the na
tional coffers. During her first tenure, her
husband was nicknamed "Mr. 10 Percent"
for his cut of government monies; during
her second, he was known as "Mr. 40 Per
cent." Even in a third world country like
Pakistan, where the people have become
accustomed to their leaders plundering
the country for all it's worth, Bhutto's cor
ruption was unprecedented. It became
clear that she had no new proposals, no ini
tiative, no agenda other than crime. She
stood for nothing, only for keeping herself
in power.
Moreover, during her second term of
office, the country lived through a period
of terrible insecurity that saw both politi
cally motivated and random killings. I re
call myself in 1995 as a 16-year-old ducking
underneath the car seat to avoid sniper
shootings on the way to take my graduat
ing examinations. At least 2.000 people
died during that time over a period of
more than 12 months. It is unclear to this

day \\ lio the killers were. As the violence in
Pakistan's largest (itv of Karachi —my tor
mented hometown — continued unabat
ed. Bhutto finally (ailed in the arm) to take
control. It was <it this time that nearly all of
the active core ol the Mohajir Qaumi
Movement, ,t party opposed to her, was
targeted and killed l>\ snipers. I*he state of
lawlessness was sue h that her own dissent
ing brothel was killed. Ills killers are on
the loose to this day. a(l ime for whith her
husband Zardari now fat es charges.
Bena/ii had a lot of potential, confi
dence .md popularity when she arrived
in 1988. One may blame conspiracies,
her husband, her feudal party, even
Osama bin l.aden foi her failure. But she
had two chances, a lot more than many
other people have. And she failed the
country miserably and inexcusably both
times. Nevertheless, many in the Western
media have continued to see her as a
martyr, granting her favorable coverage
and plentiful airtinie.
It pained objective, non-partisan Pak
istanis even where to see the articulate but
merely cosmetu politician being promoted
thus. 1 ogive an indication of Pakistani sen
timents towards a possible re-election of
Bena/ir Bhutto as Prime Minister, 1 con

ported Ms. Bhutto for re-election or op
posed her. All of those who replied said
they opposed the re-election of the person
who nearly destroyed their country. Most
Pakistanis now prefer the current military
regime to her brand of democracy. The
blame can be laid on the shoulders of her
and politicians like her.

Benazir Bhutto leaves a poor legacy
"Oncol the world's first woman prime
ministers in .1 countn tradition.ill\ domi
nated l>\ men, she is not just an intelligent
and charismatic politician, but epitomi/es
modernity, mdependem e. st\le and
hope." So wrote One World Knrope's
Hans /oiner ol Benazir Bhutto in 1907.
Indeed. Bhutto has tome to s\ mbolize the
West's hopes tor Islamic Asia. But in hei
two terms as prime minister, she onh shat
tered the hopes Pakistanis had for their
newh democratic country.
I lic I larvard and ()xforcl graduate ar
rived in 1988 1 arising the extensive bag
gage of our Pakistani hopes. She was an ed
ucated, liberal, democratically-elected fe
male prime minister who would save our
exhausted country from the tyrannies of
military dictatorship. But those hopes were
dashed as she submerged the country into
a level of corruption and lawlessness that
even a third-world nation like Pakistan had
not seen before.
I'wice dismissed from government on
allegations of extreme corruption, she has
todav lost credibility with the millions of
fbrmei supporters of her political party,
who all once cherished her. But after more
than two years of self-imposed exile to
avoid jail time for corruption, Bhutto still
has the audacity to seek conspiracy theo
ries to explain her dismissals. After her
egregious terms in office, complaints about
unfair treatment are not going to restore
Pakistani faith in Benazir Bhutto.
Bhutto comes from a prominent feudal
family, and her husband Asif Zardari is
himself a feudal lord. I he feudal system in
Pakistan thrives on the ideology of stasis.
I his keeps the serfs on their lands unedu
cated and in bondage for generations. The
ideology of Bhutto's regime was no differ
ent. She betrayed women's hopes during

both her tenures. 1988-1990 and 1993-
199b, when she, the liighlv educated
woman prime minister, failed to put forth
even a single piece of legislation on
women's 1 ights in Pakistan. Nor did she re
peal am of the previous militan regime's
severe restrictions on women.
Meanwhile, the economy soured as
Blmtto and her husband pilfered millions
of dollars from the near-empty treasurv.
I ler first tenure is surpassed onh In her
second in the unparalleled rates of corrup
tion and crime, as documented b\ over
