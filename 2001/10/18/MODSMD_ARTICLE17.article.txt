WOMEN'S FIELD HOCKE~
Saturday: Stanford at Pacific, 1:00
p.m., Brookside Field, Stockton, CA
Stanford ((>-(>. 2-0 NorPac) plays at Pacif
ic (3-7,2-1) on Satnrda\ and then hosts Saint
Ixniis (5-8, ()-!i) on Sunday and I nest lay.
Although these games comprise fully
half of the Cardinal's Not Pat schedule,
the team isn't worried.
"I think they're used to it," heat I coach
Sheryl Johnson said of the on-again, off
again schedule.
After a season that so far has seen them
play seven mat I games in nine days and then
go three weeks without facing an opponent,
tiie squad is ready for an intense weekend.
"It's st> much fun," junior forward
Tysie Sawyer said. "I think everyone's
looking forward to it."
Because of the nature of their schedule,

the Cardinal does not worry ninth about
the tendencies of its opponents. Prat lite is
mostly devoted to perfecting individual
and team skills and polishing the basic
game plan to use against .ill opponents.
"We've been reall\ good at implement
ing what we've been practicing into the
games," Johnson said.
I lie Cardinal certainK looked well
prepared in last Sunday's !M) shutout of
Pacific, in which solid team play helped se
nior forward F.rica Swesey score all ol
Stanford's goals lot the second straight
game. Although Swesey did all the stor
ing, it was skillful execution by the entire
team that made her hat trick possible.
"It's a great time for it to all becoming to
gether." senior defender Melita Sawyer saitl.
In Saturday's rematch, Pacific will try to
lind an answer for Stanford's skilled of
fense. Should they manage to do that,
however, they will still have it) figure out
how tt) best the Cardinal defense, which
has helped senior goalkeeper Rebecca
Shapiro record two consecutive shutouts.
Pacific's home turf may play a role in
the game, as Saturday's matchup is the
only game all year where the Cardinal
plays on grass.
"It doesn't really ailed your game plan
hut you have to make technical changes,"

Melita Sawyer said. "()n turf everything is
accurate and quick, hut grass is bumpy
and slow."
"Alter playing on our field, which is the
best turfin the nation, it's hard to play any
where else," Johnson said.
Stanford's offensive attack is keyed by a
suilt passing game, but a slower field slows
down I m >t 112 i teams' passing, so it shouldn't hurt
the Cardinal much more than the Tigers.
Johnson singled out the team's execu
tion on penalty corners, rebounding and
ability to get into the circle as offensive
strong points.
" I think our passing is really good right
now," said Johnson, who added, "Our
team defense is very strong."
I he Stanford defense will need to be
strong against Saint Louis. Ibe Billikens
defeated Indiana 3-2 in double overtime
when sophomore midfielder Lindsey I x>m
bardo took a shot, tripped, did a somersault
and jumped back to her feet just as the ball
rebounded off of Indiana goalie Katie ka
nara's pads, l-ombardo then calmly lined
the game-winner into the back of the net.
Although such acrobatics are unlikely to
sway the outcome of the two games against
Saint I.ouis, Stanford will be prepared lot
,i Billikens squad that, like the (Cardinal, is
on a three-game winning streak.

Ibis weekend's opponents and the
NorPac in general are less challenging
than NCAA powerhouses Maryland and
Michigan State, whom theCardifi.il faced
early in the season, but that doesn't mean
that Stanford's play has become lax.
"Those harder match-lips are .i lot of
fun too, but I definitely think we're play

ing better now than earlier in tin- season."
said Melita Sawver.
Sunday's game on the Varsii\ l-'ield
Hockey I'urf starts at I p.m., and I lies
day's rematch begins at 2 p.m.
"We're so excited because I think we
can show people how good we are." said
I vsie Sawyer.
