with a new twist. 1 he album sounds rouglth
like a \ ideo game sound u at k. in that the i li

darkci images of death, parah sis and ben a\ -

1 his dichotomv, featured as a theme
dm nighout the album, is. according to bassist
Joel Petei sen, "perfet tly sumined up" in the
album title, lie highlights the cleverness of
tlieii manipulation ol simple pop beats, ex
plaining. "Dance music is usually just that
dam e music. 1 here is not often unit li more
than that. Ivrical content ot general sub
stance. We were coming from a background
of songw riting and having things to sav. We
still wanted to continue with that, and we
were getting more interested in electronic
and dance music, and it's w hat came natui al
h Ihe result is a very listenable vet intri( ate
album, which recycles the nils and climaxes
of their new wave predecessoi s, yet integrates
original insights into the musit.
I he Paint weren't alwavsan electronic in
spired band. I lie band formed asa trio, with
founding members I odd and( lark Bae( hie,
as well as Petersen, in 1904. Performing
undei the name Norman Bailer, they began
their career like any other indie rock band,
picking up guitar because it was eas\ to get
and it was what they saw on TV. However,
they S(K>n grew bored with the kinds of
sounds they could make on the guitar.
"We realized [guitar | had limitations and
we were looking to expand what we wanted
to do."Petersen explains. We worked to
wards synthesizers and electronics because
we felt that there were an infinite amount of
for making sounds "! le dest ribes
the change .is being gradual, as technology
improved and as the band got better at un
dei standing it.

Petersen (ites the main challenge of leav
ing behind guitars as learning another * re
ative process on a separate instrument. I le
explains, the Faint often siill compose
around guitars but "lose them fu the final
form of the song."
1 lie (lunge lias definitely been welcome
among audience members. Spin.corn is
quoted to have said," II vou haven't seen the
Faint live, well, you're lame, l lie Faint's
live set is guaianteed t<> get you on your feet
.uid darn ing.
"We put ,i lot of time and thought intoom
live show. s.i\s Petersen. "We do lights and
whatnot. W'e want to be entertaining loi an
audience member .is well as entertaining to
ourselves. We pla\ live so that people will
have a good time. I hat's w li.it makes it worth
it for lis."
On their first nationwide toui since the
release of "Danse Macabre."— which
brought them to Bottom of the 1 lill in San
Fiancisco last Fridav— I he Faint have set
out to prove they are a staple in music. |ust
this past week, the album, wlrii li is the follow
up to their highly ac( lainied "Blankwave Ar
cade," jumped up to on the "C'.M |" Fop
200 (the only records above it were Bjork
and Stereolab).
Not bad lor a band that relies on the < jii.il
it\ ol its musk and the support of its friends
for promotion. I lie Faint are yet another
promising act breaking through on ()niaha's
Saddle ( reek records. Saddle ('.reek, wlik li
also boasts songw riting prodigy Conor
Oberst of Bright Fves, kh k band Cursive,
and soon, the soothing sounds of Atlanta's
soft-spoken Azure l\.i\. was started In close
friends ot the bands. I lie inusiciaiisesseuti.il-
Iv formed a community in order to support
each other's musk. Once the label Ixrante
iiKxleratelv successful such that thev could
fund then music expenses, they hired a cou
ple of people to handle the business aspects.
" Fire ideas started a long time ago, and we
were all there in the beginning," explains Pe
tersen. "It's just a group of friends in a collet -
live run label — us being part of it. We're all
friends and we all reallv care alxnit each
other's bands."
I he bands have been close friends for at
least eight years, at times, supporting each
other not onlv as friends but often from witlr

in itic reliears.il loom.
Petersen reveals,"[()berst] helped usoui a
bit on the last album we did. on a song that
didn't make it onto the album, but it |ust got
released. I le sangoti it. Its niosth alxnit con
structive criticism more than collaboration."
I hey siniplv share the same love tor song
w i iting and expi essiug theit ideas.
In the long run. all the Faint hope to ac
complish is to be happ\ with their music. Ac
cording to Petersen, "so tai we a I read \ are
I he\ also hope to spend some time pin suing
other forms ot art, although niusu will ic
m.liu their primal \ ft mis (Petersen graduat
ed with a degree in advci Using, I )a|x>se went
to art sch(K)l, l odd got Ins degree in music
and painting. Jacob iN working on a degree in
video technology in art and Clark is also
working on graph it design).
Flic Faint speak highly ol their experi
ences in art school as contributing to their
success as musk ians.
"Being around othei forms of art .talking
about and (riti(|uiirgother fbrnrsof art helps
\ou understand expression," Petersen savs.
"We had this talk m the band of \isual art
versus musk We all tr\ to keep it pretty re
lated. For us. it's one thing. We are interest
ed equally in all forms of art, but we don't

have a lot ol time to devote to other forms
I lopefulK in the future we will. It's that side
of a pel sou that's more interested in making
an artistk statement rather than being .i
dude in a band."
1 heir flare for \ isual art can be seen on the
album (over itself. I he album pictures a col
lage ol fonts and images designed In the
band members. Petersen describes the con
ception of "Danse Macabre"'s (over work:
"We were in the studio and we had a pretty
good idea ol what the niusu would end up
being. We had 'Danse M.u abre' as a working
title. We wanted something to bridge the tw< >:
the music and the album title. We wanted
everything to lit together."
I hey (reate the music all the indie scene
ster kids have been dying to make — aci essi
ble, suitably retro vet totally original. Their
music not onlv bursts with sincerity but is
something you can shake your booty to — a
very rare (xcurrence these days.
Not only that, but "Danse Macabre" holds
up in quality when you're sober and sitting in
voin bedroom. It may take a few listens, but 1
can honestly say it's one of a couple records
this veai I can listen to all the way through.
