# Corky Romano: Sucks

### J.J. MCKEEVER 
1 here's ,i new mo\ ie .tl < ineplexes this
week fin those <>l von who reallx enjoved
"Sin.nl S.ives His latnilx. I cannot even
begin to describe (o you how much "(.orkx

Romano" sinks. Fixing to aualv/e its
flaws would be on pai xviih me trving to
explain win I don't enjoy having m\
genitals gnawed b\ ravenous donkexs.
Hut tins is m\ job, so liet egoes nothing.
I here are times dm ing the absurd
ly painful our hour and 2(> minutes

when "Corky Romano" feels like an exer
cise demonstrating just how dillii nit com
edy can be. Surely, no one can be more
aware of its elusiveness than "Corkx's"
producer, Robert Simonds, the man who
has been responsible for, and I exaggei ate
not. the entire "Problem Child" saga,
"That Darn Cat," "Airheads." "Joe Dirt,"
"See Spot Run," "Mead Ovei Heels" and
"Little Nickx ." You max xvondei how tins

man still has a job.
I guess I should tell vou something
about the story, although I won't trouble
\<>u too much. Chris Rattan plaxs (ioik\
Romano, the estranged son of a tnalioso
and.in aspiring veterinarian. When

(!oi k\ s fat liei .
plaxed bx Peter
1 .ilk. is threatened
bx a gi and jinx in
dii tment. the latni-
Ix enlists ('.orkx lo
infiltrate the FBI

and . . . all right, enough. All vou reallx
need to know about the plot is that there's
too iniK hof it. 1 got the feeling that "('.orkx
Romano" had origin.illx been intended as
a high-concept thriller a la Jerry Bruck
heimer, and only later did first-time direc
tor Rob I'ritts and company dec ide to turn
it into a screwball comedy featuring the
SNI. flax or of t he week. Well, its a fine line
between the two. It's just a shame no one

bothered to tweak the s( i ipt. At all.
As tot the t ast, it seems no one
took the time to due them in on the
film's conceptual metamorphosis
either. Petet Berg and Pent) both
seem to think they're making the
sequel to "(ioodfellas. Richard
Roundtree (how could the\ make
the original Shaft act so lame)
makes up lot plaving a vigilante all
those years In portaying .111 ultra
nice FBI director. Oh yeah:
There s also Vanessa Shaw as
(lorky's love interest. She seems to
be confused about the distinction

between "ailing" and "being a stone
laced bin h." I know, Vanessa. It's subtle.
You'll get the bang ol it.
It's a pity, too, because 1 like ( lit is Rat
tan. As mv interest in what was happening
on screen began to dissipate, I began to
wonder il bis hyperactive chimp-thing,
"Mr. Peepers', could carry a movie. It

would be like another "Fncino Man" —
except without Brendan Fraser. You cast
"Doug" from "TV Funhouse" as the
goofy /.ookeeper, bring Marlon Brando
hack to reprise Dr. Moreau, have Rattan
puke up a few apples on both of the —
you got yourself a movie. Hell, I'd pay to
watch tlie outtakes from th.it production.
|u.si a thought.



You really want to see my monkey thing?
