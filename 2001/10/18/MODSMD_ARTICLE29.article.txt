# A 						Wonderful 'Drive'

### RANDY MANO 
Without even seeing a single
episode of " Twin lY.iks," or watching
the acclaimed 1980s films "Blue Vel
vet" or "Mcphant Man," I can tell that
writcr-dirci tor David l.vm h is a vision
ar\ with few rivals. I,vnch has long
been known for his risque themes and
complex, twisty plot lines that go
against the grain of mainstream cine
ma. His latest, "Mulholland Drive,"
pushes the l>oundar\ like no other film
this year to da//le the eves and con

I have seen l.vnch at work before.
"The Straight Story," which earned
veteran actor Richard Karnsworth an

was said to lack tin* usual I.vncli trademark. In fact, that film was even released
under the Disney banner and earned a"( 1" rating. I his is not to say that the biopic
— a true-life retelling of a man's journey across state lines to visit an ailing broth

I suppose what is most admirable about "Mulholland Drive" is its breathtaking.

heart-stopping atmosphere. A Spanish-singing diva
belts out a haunting rendition of Roy Orbison's "('.ly

Mulliolland Drive to the moodv score. An albino cow

condo, who befriends Rita (I.aura I fai ring); Adam (Justin I heroux), an up-and

condominium complex.

roles are distributed to bigger names, including Robert Forster, Dan Hedaya and
billy R.tv (1m us. On the whole, all of the parts are well-managed, although their
importance may not be fully revealed until the last act, when many of the loose
ends are resolved, albeit somewhat unconventionally.
1 guarantee, in fact, that despite your best intentions, you will likely need — and
want —to see "Mulholland Drive" more than once if you want to place all the
characters, symbols and allusions in their proper perspective. This is one wicked,
wild joy ride for the senses that hopefully will score Lynch some recognition from
Academy voters.


Happy birthday, Mr. President
