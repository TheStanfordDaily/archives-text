full-time commitment, first as president

year as president, which Zimbardo will
begin in |anuarv 2002 and a third veai as
past president.
While Zimbardo's primary passion is
teaching, he said he could not pass up the
opportunity to guide the psychological
world in its quest to study and improve all
facets of human life.
"Psychology significantly impacts our
