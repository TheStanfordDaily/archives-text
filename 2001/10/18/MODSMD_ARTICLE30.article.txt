# 'Iron Monkey' more than funky
## Kung Fu meets ballet and Robin Hood 
### JASON ROSENSWEIG 
Pure virtuoso action is "Iron Monkey," director Yuen
Wo I'ing's 1993 movie, now released in the I.S. In Mira
max. Ping and "Iron Monkey" ride the success ol
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and the Matrix,
whose fight scenes he choreographed. 1 his pure-bred
I long Kong action story is a non-epic "( touching Tiger,"

or a Matrix without a metaphor for human
existence. It does not try to be anything
more than a martial arts movie, but it's as
good as they come.
A wonderfully minimalist plot is no
more than an arena for Donnie Yen and
Yu Rong-Guang to flip, kick and swirl
through 1858 China like human torna-

docs. Yu plays the title role, Robin Hood-ing against a
corrupt government hv night and curing the sick and
oversexed as Dr. Yang by day. Yen plays Wong kei-Ying,
mercenary master extraordinaire and father of Wong
Fei-I lung (who, grown up, becomes a character for Jack
ie ('hail and Jet Li in a few of their breakthrough films).

Iron Monke\ shows exactly win in the last few vears,

launched out ol Hong Kong cinema and into the l .S.

"Iron Monke\ s choreograpln contrasts with .i Van

It's refreshing to see such talent,
too often excluded from Americin
cinema, in wide release, thanks to Mi
ratnax and .1 "Quentin 1 arantino
Presents" byline. When Aug Lee al
most won the Oscar lor Best Picture

with "Crouching Figer," ho painfully reminded us of the
inadequacy oi Hollywood films that are too constrained
by lazv American audiences accustomed to soap operas,
sitcoms and MTV.
But "Crouching Tiger" was more than a foreign film;
it was a glorious synthesis. Taiwanese-horn Lee brought

together I long Kong art forms like Yuen Wo Ping's with
American art forms he learned .it N.Y.U. and during
decades living in the I'.S. And Iron Monke\ backtracks
to that purity. 1 he culminating fight scene, twirling on
Wo-Ping's pioneering wire technique, si//les as the two
heroes battle the evil Royal Minister on top of flaming
wooden poles.
Yen and Yu dance, literally, on the line between amaz
ing feats and the impossible, teasing us out onto the dance
floor to believe.
