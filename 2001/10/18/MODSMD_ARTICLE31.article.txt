# Hawke needs training
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Early in "Training Da\", nar
cotics officer Alon/o I farris (I)en
/el Washington) turns to rookie
Jake Ilovt (Ethan Hawke) and
asks him, "So why do you want to
be a narc?"
Without thinking, Hoyt
replies, "I want to serve my com
munity In ridding it of danger
ous drugs."
"That's nice," Alon/o laughs,
"lint really, why do you want to Ik
a narc?"
"I want to make detective,"
I foyt admits sheepishly.
Most of what follows in the film
is an extension of this, as Hoyt
learns more about the lure of com
promise and corruption in the po-

lice depart
ment and
within him
self. When
"Training
Day" is in this
mode, screen
writer David

Ayer's (" I lit- Fast and the Furi
ous") story of a rookie police offi
cer's first day in the narcotics divi
sion generally works. It may not
always Ik- as absorbing or as per
ceptive as it wants to be, but it
makes a genuine effort to explore
tlit* relevant issue of what can
make a good cop crooked.
More importantly, "Training
Day" is one of the best perfor
mances of Denzel Washington's
career. Clad in black leather and
silver jewelry, Washington seems
to be a dark reflection of all the
flawed heroes (most recently

II e r ma 11
lloone in "Re
member the
I itans") that
he's made his
re pu tat ion
playing. The
intensity and
the charisma
are still here,
onh tweaked
slightly and
coupled with a
devilish smile
to create a

truly complex
and memorable villain.
When Washington is onscreen,
it's easy to forgive the film for its
earnestness and predictability, to
overlook the tiresome way in

which the musical
score tries to build
tension and the oc
casional whininess in
Hawke's perfor
mance. For most of
the movie, Washing
ton's portrait of a

deeply corrupt but still sympa
thetic man manages to hold every
thing else together.
Hut then it all falls apart.
Fifteen minutes before the end,
t he nit >vie l< >ses all fixiis on the cul
ture of compromise and corrup
tion that it has worked so hard to
capture. It is content to become a
shoot-em-up. with Alonzo as your
basic psychotic villain.
It's hard to figure out who de
serves the blame for this ending.
Did some studio executive decide
that "Training Day" needed an
action-movie finale? Did director

Antoine Fuqua (" The Replace
ment Killers"), who managed to
restrain himself for the first hour
and 45 minutes, finally give in to
his urge to stage a really l>ig gun
fight? Or was .ill of the idiocy,
from the utterly preposterous co
incidences to the laughably out of
place fantasy action, in Ayer'sorig
inal script?
At this point, not even Wash
ington could save "Training
Day"from its moronic ending,
and he doesn't even try. Instead,
as everything else in the film goes
completely over the top, so does
he. I le throws .ill restraint out the
door and spends his final scenes
strutting and bellowing, like
some pathetic caricature of the
character he portrayed earlier in
the movie.
So when " Training Day" ends,
despite a final half-hearted at
tempt at relevant e, it ends in a py
rotechnic explosion of bullets.
And the audience is left disap
pointed at a film with so much po
tential which has become just an
other medkx re action flick.
