### EREZ YOELI 
li has been years since I've suffered so much in a concert. It wasn't the
fault of the orchestra: the\ were splendid. The choir was magnificent as
well. Fven the soloists were palatable. In fact, the source of my misery was
not in the evening's program. The culprit was a banana.
Yes. a banana. As the choir sang the first notes in Brahms' "A (ierman
Requiem," mimic king a perfect 1\ executed French horn solo, all I could do
was shrivel up in in\ chair and i urse bananas.
1 am apparently incapable of properly digesting bananas. II I eat only
one of the tasiv vellow fruit, I acquire an intense stomach-ai he which lasts
for several hours. You'd think I could rememlxT 11 lis. But no, on Friday

night, I (leaded to end my meal
with a particularly excellent ba
nana. 1 paid dearly lor every bite.
Yet the night went on, banana
or not, and it was quite a success.
Davies Symphony Hall was
teeming with San Francisco's rich
.tnd well-educated — there were
lew empty seats. Hie ball itself is

a marvel/Hie stage is roomy, the choir well placed, the organ magnificent.
From where we sat, we had an unobstructed view of the orchestra and the
acoustics were warm and clean.
Very few on hestras are blessed with such avenue for rehearsals and per
formances. Philadelphia's Academy of Music is notorious: it is often said
that the Philadelphia ()rchestra is good because their hall is so bad. In Pel
Avi\. the Philharmonic has alreadv witnessed one acoustic remodeling of
the Kit hal I latarlxxX, and in New York, Avery Fisher keeps the audience
cold and removed.
Phe focus of the night's program was not, as advertised, Brahms' Re
quieni. By the time it rolled around, I was in such wretched agony that 1
was in no mood to enjoy it. Indeed, I lost interest after the first two move
ments, though this was not entirely the fault of the performers or-the com
poser. Bananas are evil.
I did, however, enjoy Shoenberg's 1 heme and Variations." Orchestras
tespt >ntl to at hallenge and this piece gave the Symphony a chance to show
its worth. I he textures invoked by Shoenberg's orchestration were beauti
ful, rich and varied. Michael lilson Thomas, the Orchestra's musical di
rector and the evening's conductor, should be congratulated for his inter
esting and surprisingly accessible interpretation.
Despite this, 1 don't recommend the sudden purchase of a large Shoen-
Ik'i g repetoire. Of all the musicians I know, only one truly reveres the Ger
man composer and he doesn't count: he's a music theorist and a compos-

rr. Shoenberg is difficult listening
— this is tlic first tonal piece of his
that I've heard, lor once, I could
apprcciatc the compc >ser's virtuosi
ty without ci inging.
Hie second movement ol the
Brahms was also well plaved. I he
c hoii s interaction with the orches
tra was careful and balanced. I lie
limp,mist supported the theme
music all\ and the brass followed its
solid performance ol the first
movement with even more exact
plaving. I lie next time you are
seated in front of your stereo hold
ing a recording of Cesar l r.nick's
"Svniphonv in I) minor" in your
left hand and one of Brahms' "Re
quiem" in vout right hand, turn
tlietu Im>t 11 to track two. 112 ranc k re
cvcled the theme from the Brahms
in his Svniphonv. I admit, I prefer
the Franck.
Krenek's "Die Nachtigall" is no
match for either. Flizalieth Futral
was young, pretty, exquisitely
dressed and talented but she was
no nightingale. She was boring.
Ilie entire piece was a mush of sad
harmonies and monotonous voic
ing. If it weren't for that damn ba
nana. I'd have fallen asleep.
Fortunately, the piece was short
andquic kh forgotten. Ilie audience
forgave the orchestra, rewarding
them instead with three standing
ovations at the end of the Brahms.
I stayed for .ill three, then
slunk out, drove home and curled
into bed.
