eclectic col-

lage ol sounds, songs and textures on this (11).
\ nuinhci ol things are immediately appar
ent when listening to this album. First, ii is
tcchuicalh superb. Ihe Frio's musical tastes
run the gamut — from Brazilian |az/ to funk
to classic RX. Band —and tlieii ability to assemble

.1 well-struc 1 ured set
t hat showcases so main
flavors of music is truly
impressive.
Addition.ill\. the tracks

serve up a variety ol
moods and emotions. "Find an Oasis," which
features the soul-inflected opeiatu vocals ol
(lielis.l. blends dance-friendly drums with a
piano and string instrumental arrangement.
"Fdonv" balances African spoken-word poetr\
with I loss,nn Rainzx's Middle F.asiei 11 percus
sion fora distinctl\ downbeat llavor. With its
fasiei R&B-tinged singing and groo\v s\ nihetic
beats, Afronaughrs " I ranscend Me" provides a
ni( e burst ol energy.
Perhaps the onl\ drawback ol the C.I) is the
length of .1 few of the songs. Sequel's "I psolid.
which emploxs .1 ven common sounding s\n
iheiic beat and .1 whim, distorted horn, begins
feeling tired about half-wax through its si\ min
utes. ( loc king iu at more than seven minutes,
several of the songs, with iheii looping drum
and beat tracks, grow too repetitive for casual
listening. I lus. however, ma\ be the 1 esult of the
seamless links between each song.
Of course that's .1 reflection ol the fact that ul
timateh this is a C.l) of dance music. Ili.it
doesn't mean von can't listen to it in the car,
alone .it home. 01 even while working. With a
range encompassing so many st\les of music,
there's something here for every situation, even
mood and even personality.


Transcend me.
