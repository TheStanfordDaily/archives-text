fessor of International Relations, lie

tics," and a tiuinbei of undergraduate
and graduate seminars.
"I have taught at Stanford since
1981," Krasner said. "For fhe last decade,
I have been working primarily on issues
of sovereignty — how it should be un
derstood and what the rules of sover
eignty have meant in practice.
"I have also worked on issues related
to the politics of international economic

relations," he added.
After finding out about the opening in
ilic State Department last spring, Kras

cause he had been studying internation
al relations for.SO years but had never he
fore worked in government.
Krasner will be in the Policy Planning
Bureau advising the director of policy
planning and the Secretary of State.
"I will be trying to help [them] think a
little bit ahead of daily events, not an easy
thing to do under the present circum
stances," Krasner said.
I hough they wish him well in his new
position, many students said they are
sorry to see him go.
"No doubt, the community at Stan
ford will be missing out on a great
teacher, scholar, mentor and colleague,"
said Christopher Wang, class of '97. "As
Prof . Krasner undertakes his role in pub
lic service, 1 am confident of his success.
Given [ his] leadership qualities, sheer in
tellectual ability and agility and academic

expertise, the State Department is luc kv
to have him.
"And indeed, we, as a country are
lucky to have him on our side."
Other students echoed Wang's high
praise for Krasner's teaching.
Alex Weisiger, class of 2000 and cur
rently a doctoral student at Columbia
University, said, "[Krasner] cultivates an
intimidating persona in his undergrad
c lass and when you first meet with him,
but after he agrees to work with you he's
very friendly."
Recent Stanford graduate Nava Aslitaf,
currently a doctoral student «tt I larvard, s.iid.
"His introductory i lass on international rela
tions was the best c lass I've taken. His manner
of challenging students to rethink our as
sumptions about the world was exceptional."
However, all hope is not lost for
prospective political science or interna
tional relations students at Stanford. "I

Summarizing his goals .it the
St.ite Department, Krasnei said,
"I hope to get a better understand
