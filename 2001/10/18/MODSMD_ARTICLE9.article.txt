feel the I .S. needs to take a different approach
in responding to the Sept. I 1 terrorist attacks.
Assoc . Prof, of Middle Kastei n Studies Ahmad
I )allal said, "| li | makes more sense to treat this .is
.1 policing effort rather than a war where the
I nited States, in conjunction wit Ii international
bodies, goes after criminals, because il is the
criminals who are responsible, not ihecountr\."
Dallal added that the long-term effects of
these bombings are severe.
"Muslims are collcctivcK being targeted and
blamed for these crimes and ibis will sci in motion
.i series of events that will last .i longtime to tome."
he said. "In the future, Muslims w ill be, in ac crtain
sense, dehuniani/ed and treated like < riminals.
"The bombings will lead to more discontent
in Afghanistan and create more people like
< )saina bin Liden, who was alreach to some ex
tent, an oflshoot of American foreign polio."
I )allal said.
()thers in (lie Islamic communih agreed that
the U.S. Ac lions are unjust.
Senioi I rein Saleem janjua, president <>l the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network, said she reacted
strongh to the I S. bombings against Afghanistan.

"I am very sad about the bombings and the
l< >ss i >1 inncKent lives," she said. "1 have heard the
reasons win the I S. is bombing Afghanistan but
1 strong!) disagree with then reasons and 1 think
this bombing is blatanth unjust.
"MiliiaiA ac lion against acounti) c an never Ik'
justified. I .oss t>l innocent human lives is unjusti
fiable. Ii is a crime against humanity," she said.
Vice President of MSAN Mohammed Ab
doolcarim, a junior, pointed out that a war
againsi lerroi ism is panic tilarh difficult lxvause
"terrorism isn't a military regime that you want
to deslro) — it's a belief."
"fundamentalists Ix'lieve that the) have to
perform /iliad, and I feel thai bombing tlieni is
not the means In which to solve terrorism," he
said. "Instead we encourage and promote the
c\ il and hatred that terrorism instills."
I )allal agreed thai addressing the c in rent sit -
nation between the I Sand the Middle l ast re
quires resolving deeph rooted issues.
"A poli< ing efloi I in conjunction with collabo
i at ion with v.u ions count i ies — including man)
Muslim countries—has to fight a war against
miserv and povei iv." he s.ucl. "It is not just a sort
of peace with the Middle fast but a vei \ genuine
attempt lo resolve the conflict."
Several Muslims s.iid the> believe that the
bombings show lack of compassion for the
war-torn, povertv-stricken country of
Afghanistan and therein increase negative
feelings toward the I niled Stales within the
Islamic communit v.

"I do not believe it is an appropriate foreign
policy," Abdoolcarim said. "President Bush has
recognized the Muslim community in the Unit
ed Slates and sees them as 112 riends, but his ac tions
are not consistent with w hat he says."
"I believe that the U.S. has a right to achieve
justice, but the way they're doing it is not justi
fied," Abdoolcarim added. "I support them in
getting rid of C Kama; he's not doing a service to
Islam. 1 support the United States in targeting
l he faliban because they are responsible for the
attacks taking place, but I don't support the
I niled States in bombing Afghanistan at all be
cause that w ill just spread more hale."
Abdoolcarim also said that many members ol
the Islamic communit) have no particular ex
pectations with regards to the outcome of the
I S. air strikes.
"It reallv depends on how the whole con
flu t is dealt with," be said. "We could be mov
ing toward a much worse or much bettei | sit -
nation]. It just depends on what policies pre
vail, and that's why it is important for the
American public to be involved because il in
volves our future.
"We have to fie verv careful and critical,"
\hdoolcarim continued. "Our job is to scruti
nize the policy, and polio makers especially,
because they are verv uninformed about
Afghanistan. Hopefully, there'll be more and
more people w ho will get involved and bring a
rational and contemplative voice and think
about things differently."

quires resolving deeph rooted issues.
"A poli< ing efloi I in conjunction with collabo
i at ion with v.u ions count i ies — including man)
Muslim countries—has to fight a war against
miserv and povei iv." he s.ucl. "It is not just a sort
of peace with the Middle fast but a vei \ genuine
attempt lo resolve the conflict."
Several Muslims s.iid the> believe that the
bombings show lack of compassion for the
war-torn, povertv-stricken country of
Afghanistan and therein increase negative
feelings toward the I niled Stales within the
Islamic communit v.

"I do not believe it is an appropriate foreign
policy," Abdoolcarim said. "President Bush has
recognized the Muslim community in the Unit
ed Slates and sees them as 112 riends, but his ac tions
are not consistent with w hat he says."
"I believe that the U.S. has a right to achieve
justice, but the way they're doing it is not justi
fied," Abdoolcarim added. "I support them in
getting rid of C Kama; he's not doing a service to
Islam. 1 support the United States in targeting
l he faliban because they are responsible for the
attacks taking place, but I don't support the
I niled States in bombing Afghanistan at all be
cause that w ill just spread more hale."
Abdoolcarim also said that many members ol
the Islamic communit) have no particular ex
pectations with regards to the outcome of the
I S. air strikes.
"It reallv depends on how the whole con
flu t is dealt with," be said. "We could be mov
ing toward a much worse or much bettei | sit -
nation]. It just depends on what policies pre
vail, and that's why it is important for the
American public to be involved because il in
volves our future.
"We have to fie verv careful and critical,"
\hdoolcarim continued. "Our job is to scruti
nize the policy, and polio makers especially,
because they are verv uninformed about
Afghanistan. Hopefully, there'll be more and
more people w ho will get involved and bring a
rational and contemplative voice and think
about things differently."
