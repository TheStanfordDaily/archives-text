Co-sponsored by the Center for Conserva

Community Relations, Habitat Restoration
Day is part ofStanlord's (conservation and I *Â«e
Plan for the Dish area. Ihe plan was an

fo showcase the richness of the area, there
will be a natural history exhibit of indigenous
flora and fauna. Participants can also take .1
walking tour to learn more about the new tiger
salamander tunnel.
I he tunnel, located under (unipero Sena
Blvd., was installed In the University earlier
this year to provide a safe route for California
tiger salamanders crossing the area during mi
gration season. The (enter plans to build sev

eral sm.ill ponds to provide .1 breeding ground
of seasonal wetlands for the salamanders.
Sean Anderson, a postdoctoral fellow at the
(enter, emphasi/ed that California coastal re
gions do not have manv juvenile oak trees, l or
this reason, he feels that the planting of these
trees on Saturday will be a significant event.
"We will literal!) be seeding the future
woodlands adjacent to Cerona Gate," Ander
son said.
Carol Boggs, the (enter's director, said she
hopes that the Habitat Restoration Da\ activi
ties will stir interest in important environmen
tal issues.
"Ihe first goal is to promote awareness
among the Stanford community," she said.
" I he second is to give people a < hance to get
involved because there was a lot of expression
of interest when Stanford first started the con
servation etlorts."
In addition to enhancing the flora of the
Dish, Anderson said he hopes to find people
who are interested in helping with the restora
tion work. Although several restoration efforts

have been put into ellet ( .is .1 result <>l the < on
servation plan, Anderson explained that inan\
people are unaware ol the work being done.
"()ur efforts are done mostly awa\ from the
Dish trail loop and are out ol sight ol most \ is
itors," Anderson said. "We are |iisi beginning
the first readily observable restoration eHbrt."
"()yer the years, the visual beaut) ol the area
has been impaired, and the habitat ol main
sensitive native species has been damaged."
said Stuart White, an intern at the Office ol
Government and Community Relations.
White said he hopes that Habitat Restora
tion Day will promote the appretiation ol the
natural resources ol the Foothills as well as the
involvement of the communit\ 111 the conser
vation movement.
Anderson invited all people to come out
from 9 a.m. to noon tomorrow and help with
the restoration efforts.
" I his is chance lot people to be direct!)
involved with something." he said. "It's a
small chance to help heal some ol out
wounded land."
