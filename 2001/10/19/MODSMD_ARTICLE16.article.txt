## The 						Stanford Daily Berkeley City Council's resolution is inappropriate 
### 
1'iihlislmJ Since IS9I

Wednesday, the Berkeley City
Council passed a resolution urg
ing the federal government to stop
tlu' bombing campaign in
Afghanistan as soon as possible in order to
"break the cycle of \ i< >lcn< e." In addition, the res
olution formalh expressed condolences foi the
victims of'the Sept. II terrorist attacks.
While the vi< tims and theii families < ertainK
deserve sympathy, and the government ought
not prolong the bombing campaign a minute
longer than is netessarv, it is inappropriate fora
city council to be commenting on the federal
government's foreign policy.
1 hat is not to s.iv Berkeley's voice should
not be heard in the I '.S. Senate and I louse of
Representatives, where important foreign
polity decisions are made. Iwo Senators and
one (Congresswoman are the elected national
representatives of those people, sent to Wash
ington to represent the interests of that < it\
and its surrounding areas in certain realms,
including foreign polit \.

It is entirely appropriate and within the con
stitutional duty of those officials to ci itically ex
amine American foreign policy and help to
shape it b\ presiding over committee hearings,
drafting legislation and voting.
In fact, Berkeley's Congresswoman, Barbara
I ee (1) — (lA 09), did indeed express her opin
ion and that of many in her (listrid bv casting
the lone "nay" vote in a 118-1 I louse of Rep
resentatives roll call last month broadly au
thorizing the President to use fort e in order
to fight tei rorism.
I Ins action fits in line with the t Constitution,
which explicitly gives Congress — not state or
local governments —jurisdiction ovei interna
tional militaiy matters.
(Constitutional or not, it requires yen little ef
fort or thought for the Berkeley ( it\ (Count il to
make simplistic statements touterning the deci
sions of other legislative l><ulies.
Afterall, the Berkeley (City( Council's members
do not wake up each morning and go to sleep
eat b night weighing the fact that then clet isions

will .tiled ihe lives of millions, it not billions, ol
people and perhaps the future ol the free world.
I he Berkeley (lily Council's every action does
not I.ill under relentless scrutiny from the media
as well as other around the world.
I he Berkeley City Counc il is not shouldered
with the responsibility of protecting the freedom
and well-being of ,i nation of neai ly SOO million.
Because of its position of distance 112 rom the
events of Sept. 1 1 and its aftermath — both in
terms of geography and responsibility — it is
very e.tsv for the Berkeley (lity (Council to claim
.t moral high ground by weighing in against
the bombing.
II the military campaign is unsuccessful, the
Berkeley ( itv (louncil can smugly tell the world
"we told you so" from its lofty moralistic perch.
Should the military campaign succeed, terrorist
organizations be uprooted and the lives of those
ver\ (louiu il members and their families made
safer, the (louncil can still feel good about itself,
having taken a stance against violence.
Well, who isn't against violence? Who isn't

against war? No rational person enjoys seeing
the suffering and bloodshed of thousands of
people anywhere. But as much as we abhor
violence, we must trust our democratically
elected leaders to make the right decisions in
the interests of long-term peace and stability.
I fwe disagree with their actions, we can ex
ercise our constitutional rights of assembly,
petition and voting to let them hear and see
our sentiments. If we still find their political
behavior incongruous with out preferences,
we may take advantage of the periodic elec
tions also afforded by our (Constitution to re
move them from of lice. If members of a city
council wish to 11 itici/e governmental foreign
policy, they may do so on their own time in
any of the aforementioned ways.
However, it is entirely inappropriate for
local government officials to use their orga
nizations to take distant, thinly-veiled pot
shots at the government that works so hard
every day to protect their very freedom to
criticize it.
