Director of Residential Education
Jane ( amarillo.
By building 1 1u* new residence,
Student I lousing Scrvii es hopes to
partialK relieve the undergraduate
housing crunch .it Stanford. I bis
represents the first step in the I ni
versit\'s plan to eventualK iiu lease

hundred spat es.
Representatives of Student
Housing Services could not be
reached for comment on the
specifics of the new residence,
which has been in the works since
Man/an ita's const nut ion a
de< ade ago.
Every undergraduate at Stan
ford is guaranteed lour years of
housing, and currcnth about 94
percent ol the undergraduate
population liveson campus. I bus
far, the University has been able
to accommodate even under
graduate who needs housing b\
using existing space — for exam
ple, by converting doubles into
triples or housing students in
study rooms.
"We have had an undergradu
ate bousing crunch for about loin
years now, whit h has impacted both
the undergraduate and graduate
populations," (lainarillo said.
"The decision fto build a fourth
Man/anita residence] had already
been approved when Man/anita
was built, but the\ didn't have the
funding for it, she said.
I lowever, because of the recent
housing crunch, plans to build the
new Man/anita residence have
been given somewhat higher prior
ity, (lamarillo said.
Sophomore Dana Mauriello
welcomed the Res Ed decision.
"This won't affect me directly, be
cause I have no desire to live in
Man/anita," she said. "Hut last year,
someone lived in our library in
Naranja, and I'm glad they tan live
in Man/anita now."
I heCeneial Use Permit negoti
ated between Stanford and Santa
Clara Count) last year designated
residential building as an appropri
ate use of land. In fact, the countv
lias encouraged measures thai
allow more Stanford students to re
main on (ampus.
"'l'lie (>1 P was strut tured in
sin li .1 wax as to give incentives for
housing — ii is what we want and
what thecountx wants," said Larrx
Morion, director of government
and cominunitx relations.
"|\\ lien] we provide housing on
i ampus for Stanford students and
lac ult) so ili.it iliex don't commute
from oil-* ampus, it improves the
irallic conditions," Morton said.
"It 1 s also good educationally
loi students to he near other stu
(lt iiis, and near (lasses, activities
,ind intellectual life. Stanford has
alxvax s been a residential universi
t\ and the reason for that is fun

damentally cdiu ational."
"I'm anticipating no problem
whatsoever in receiving approval
in building [the Man/anita resi
dence], just as we've already re
ceived permission for two graduate
housing projects," he added.
Some students have expressed
concern over the prospect of a
greater housing ( rum li next year,
since the University announced
recently that up to two of three
Row houses —Mars, fifw May
field and f>92 Max field — max be
converted into fraternity houses
in the tall.
Since even I'raterniix is expect
ed to be full, the decision is not ex
pected to influence total available
housing for students, ac cording to
('.amarillo.
"Converting Row houses into
frats has no impact at all on the
housing crunch — it's just a drop
in the bucket," she said.
