Law student disputes Gaudet's assertions,
opinions
While Rob (iaudet 's column Wednesday
had mam insightful points, his general tone
and implic.nions were offensive io main
Muslims on tlu* Stan lord (ampus. Probablv
(he most offensive statement (iaudet made
was io (lann tli.it "Islam was not inherently
|x*ac clul." I agree wit It (iaudet on this point
to an extent, since I believe that Islam is not
"inherently" anything. Islam is a vast thing,
lull of a range ol expressions, and a multi
plicitv ol histories.
Islam is much more of a pliant, shifting
.ind organic system ol heliels than how
(iaudet seems to understand it. I hat is not.
however, to say that any belief can I.ill under
the umbrella of Islam. When (iaudet points
to the apparent inconsistencies between the
rhetoric ol Islam as a peaceful religion and
largeb isolated instances of violence in the
Muslim world, it is not at all surprising.
It reminds me ol Walt Whitman, when
he wrote. "Do I contradict myself? Yes, for I
contain multitudes." Islam has many
types of adherents, 112 rom all walks of life,
from all sorts of politic a I persuasions, vi
olent and non-violent.
(iaudet is crafty with his words, because
lu- never savs. "Islam is inherently violent."
But what he does not explicitly sav, the con
notative thrust of his article strongly insinu
ates. l or example, (iaudet gives a number
of examples from the Quran and the life of
Muhammad as incontrovertible proof that

Islam is not inherently peaceful. These ex
amples purport to show, or ;it least st rough
suggest, that there is .1 sinistei or violent side
todoctrinal Islam.
I Ins is .111 ironic statement considering it
is very, very difficult to .ist ertain the "11 uth"
about earl\ Islam from .1 <I(h trinal or histor
ical point of view. Most Islamic scholars are
painfully aware that there hundred of ac
counts of the life of Muhammad, and that it
is nearly impossible to locate tlu- "true" bio
graphical Muhammad from this bewilder
ing numtier of sources, some laudatory and
even some which are deprecatory towards
him. from both Muslim and non-Muslim
sources. It is dear that (iaudet's narrative
was a cynical understanding of the
Prophet's alleged actions, and it must alsolx*
understood that (iaudet's(haracteri/ations
of Muhammad and early doctrinal Islam
are his own, and hardly accepted "truths"
from either the traditional Islamic point of
view or even Western scholarship. For ex
ample, many scholars might stronglv dis
agree* with (iaudet's (haracteii/ation ol the
Pledge of Acjaha as a senseless or unneces
sarily bellicose "Pledge ol War."
Many Muslims would also strongly dis
agree with (iaudet's gloss of Prophet
Muhammad as a plundering pit ate, who al
legedly slaughtered 70 people, (iaudet
should keep in mind that many of the inci
dents reported alx>ut Muhammad are any
thing but authenticated. Many of the "au
thentic" accounts of Muhammad were c om
piled hundreds of years after his death.

(«audet should ii<>i parade them around as
indisputable lac Is as lie did in his column
vestcrdav, especially given the source dis
< rcpam-ies in earl) Islam. At Ik-si, we can see
(.audel s "la* Is .is interpretations based on
problem, iti* sou ices, (..unlet will be more
sophisticated when he realizes thai truth is
often .1 discursive fiuu lion.
lu an article about peace and violence,
(•audel finds it necessary to discuss the al
leged sexual history ol the Prophet, lie
writes sarcastically, "Muhammad had
dozens of wives and concubines, and almost
.ill his marriages were political alliances. I le
miisi have had a big heart to love so many
women. Ihe sarcasm is unwarranted.
(»audet s imperious tone is evident when he
says, | Muhammad] did it for the b<x)ty" or
that the motivation lor Islamic proselytiza
tion was"for riches." Apparently, (>audet
can distill character motivation from 1,100
hundred years in the past.
I -isily, RobC»andet should see that most
ly s<H'ial good has come out ol the rhetoric
that Islam stems fr<>lll |>eace." I)( h's( >audet
not realize how maligned Muslims have
been in the media, and how maligned they
continue to her Did (>audct not see the
cover ol Newsweek and I ime where yelling
Muslim men with turbans and rifles appear
like violent lunatics?
Does (•audel not see the social function
ol (ailing Islam a peaceful religion, when
countless Muslims are being harassed on ac
count of baneful stereotxpes? (falling Islam
a peaceful religion (even it one were to ac
cede that statement as onl\ parti) truthful)
serves a useful social function in a world

As I am .i Muslim invsell, I am sure read

\ears back in Pakistan under the< un ieuluni

believe I can convey a viewpoint that is
shared by the luajoritv of the western s( hol
ars of religion.
I believe some of the assertions made in
Rob Camlet's column are rather con
tentious and may wrongly influence readci s
who have .i very supet fie ial understanding
of my religion. I do not wish to oppose the
author's notion of violence in some wa\
being associated wit h .ill religions, ik >i prove
that Muslims havealwavsacted peaceliillv. 1
just feel the author has, perhaps inadver
tently, managed to taint the image ol our
I loly Prophet and his fbllowet s b\ tailing to
appreciate the c(mtext in which e.u b of the
mentioned actions was carried out. I his also
seems to have created the impression tii.it
Islam is by nature a faith that entourages its
followers to resort to violent means to
achieve their objectives.
Caudet suggests that the Pledge of War
taken In the followers of Muhammad in 022
A.I). was with an intent of fighting tor inoii
etaiy and personal gain. 1 'his argument
seems rather weak in light of the fact that
022 is the vear when Muslims bad sec ret h

migrated Irom Mcn.i to Medina in a bid to
eseape the tvranny and persecution of the
non-Muslims ol Mecca who saw Islam as a
grow ing threat to their dominance. (lod or
dered the Muslims to he prepared to fight

vei se ol the Quran was simply revealed as
ollic ial permission Irom Cod lor the Mus

failure to do so would result in their

Nations alwa\s do their best to delend
themselves against potential threats. I can't
help noticing that even Amerk .i in the 21 st
(cniui \ bombed Mghanistan and Sudan
without am concrete evidence of their in
volvement in the .American etnbass\ bomb
ings in 112 ast Africa.
I o(all Muhammad a "trench-digger, pi

I he Irene h was dug outside the (it\ when
the Muslims were only 3,000 in number
themselves and had to fight 30,000 Mecca

which less than 10 people died and the Mec
(ans were ultitnateh 112( »rt ed to return home.
Muhammad al\\.i\s led the Muslims in

were the poor people of Arabia who em

provided them with the financial and mili

Km tli.it does not mean that Islam was

the instruction ot ( iod who sought the way
lor Islam to spread as last and wide as possi

Muslim in the empire was lair enough il you
consider that such people were then given
equal status to Muslims, who paid theii o\\ n
religious taxes, in all administrative mallei s.
11 lis is probahh the most c i\ il treatment ol

I rue, Muhammad had do/ens of wives

I he I lob Prophet prepared sm h large

When it was found that no armies were

As li>r the- clause in the Quran saving

Yes, Muslims had to kill and plundci in

Student suggests Greek housing alternative
1 am delighted to read thai three new
fraternities are applying for housing. Al
though I .mi not a member of any (Ireek or
ganizations, I support housing all fraterni
ties and sororities — provided of course
thai they are housed in Wilbur. In fact,
Wilbur would be such a great place fora fra
ternity, all the fiats housed on the row
should be relocated to Wilbur immediately.
W'ilbui is a (ireek dream-palace. I he snug
living quarters will fuel the close-knit com
munity spirit that so many fraternities are
proud of Furthermore, relocating all of the
(ireeks to one central location will enhance
their community-serving power. Ihe
(ireek elite deserve none other than the
best. It is a shame that Wilbur has been de
liieil them for so long.

to the apparent inconsistencies between the

(he most offensive statement (iaudet made
was io (lann tli.it "Islam was not inherently

to an extent, since I believe that Islam is not
"inherently" anything. Islam is a vast thing,

to the apparent inconsistencies between the

Law student disputes Gaudet's assertions,
opinions
While Rob (iaudet 's column Wednesday
had mam insightful points, his general tone
and implic.nions were offensive io main
Muslims on tlu* Stan lord (ampus. Probablv
(he most offensive statement (iaudet made
was io (lann tli.it "Islam was not inherently
|x*ac clul." I agree wit It (iaudet on this point
to an extent, since I believe that Islam is not
"inherently" anything. Islam is a vast thing,
lull of a range ol expressions, and a multi
plicitv ol histories.
Islam is much more of a pliant, shifting
.ind organic system ol heliels than how
(iaudet seems to understand it. I hat is not.
however, to say that any belief can I.ill under
the umbrella of Islam. When (iaudet points
to the apparent inconsistencies between the
rhetoric ol Islam as a peaceful religion and
largeb isolated instances of violence in the
Muslim world, it is not at all surprising.
It reminds me ol Walt Whitman, when
he wrote. "Do I contradict myself? Yes, for I
contain multitudes." Islam has many
types of adherents, 112 rom all walks of life,
from all sorts of politic a I persuasions, vi
olent and non-violent.
(iaudet is crafty with his words, because
lu- never savs. "Islam is inherently violent."
But what he does not explicitly sav, the con
notative thrust of his article strongly insinu
ates. l or example, (iaudet gives a number
of examples from the Quran and the life of
Muhammad as incontrovertible proof that

Islam is not inherently peaceful. These ex
amples purport to show, or ;it least st rough
suggest, that there is .1 sinistei or violent side
todoctrinal Islam.
I Ins is .111 ironic statement considering it
is very, very difficult to .ist ertain the "11 uth"
about earl\ Islam from .1 <I(h trinal or histor
ical point of view. Most Islamic scholars are
painfully aware that there hundred of ac
counts of the life of Muhammad, and that it
is nearly impossible to locate tlu- "true" bio
graphical Muhammad from this bewilder
ing numtier of sources, some laudatory and
even some which are deprecatory towards
him. from both Muslim and non-Muslim
sources. It is dear that (iaudet's narrative
was a cynical understanding of the
Prophet's alleged actions, and it must alsolx*
understood that (iaudet's(haracteri/ations
of Muhammad and early doctrinal Islam
are his own, and hardly accepted "truths"
from either the traditional Islamic point of
view or even Western scholarship. For ex
ample, many scholars might stronglv dis
agree* with (iaudet's (haracteii/ation ol the
Pledge of Acjaha as a senseless or unneces
sarily bellicose "Pledge ol War."
Many Muslims would also strongly dis
agree with (iaudet's gloss of Prophet
Muhammad as a plundering pit ate, who al
legedly slaughtered 70 people, (iaudet
should keep in mind that many of the inci
dents reported alx>ut Muhammad are any
thing but authenticated. Many of the "au
thentic" accounts of Muhammad were c om
piled hundreds of years after his death.

(«audet should ii<>i parade them around as
indisputable lac Is as lie did in his column
vestcrdav, especially given the source dis
< rcpam-ies in earl) Islam. At Ik-si, we can see
(.audel s "la* Is .is interpretations based on
problem, iti* sou ices, (..unlet will be more
sophisticated when he realizes thai truth is
often .1 discursive fiuu lion.
lu an article about peace and violence,
(•audel finds it necessary to discuss the al
leged sexual history ol the Prophet, lie
writes sarcastically, "Muhammad had
dozens of wives and concubines, and almost
.ill his marriages were political alliances. I le
miisi have had a big heart to love so many
women. Ihe sarcasm is unwarranted.
(»audet s imperious tone is evident when he
says, | Muhammad] did it for the b<x)ty" or
that the motivation lor Islamic proselytiza
tion was"for riches." Apparently, (>audet
can distill character motivation from 1,100
hundred years in the past.
I -isily, RobC»andet should see that most
ly s<H'ial good has come out ol the rhetoric
that Islam stems fr<>lll |>eace." I)( h's( >audet
not realize how maligned Muslims have
been in the media, and how maligned they
continue to her Did (>audct not see the
cover ol Newsweek and I ime where yelling
Muslim men with turbans and rifles appear
like violent lunatics?
Does (•audel not see the social function
ol (ailing Islam a peaceful religion, when
countless Muslims are being harassed on ac
count of baneful stereotxpes? (falling Islam
a peaceful religion (even it one were to ac
cede that statement as onl\ parti) truthful)
serves a useful social function in a world
where Muslims have been incorrecil)
marginalized as violent animals. Calling
Islam peaceful onl\ begins to reverse some
of this horrific damage.

Student wishes to clarify 'true
meaning of Islam'
As I am .i Muslim invsell, I am sure read
ei swill feel I cannot help hut lx' biased in ni\
stance on Islam asa fundamental!) peaceful
religion. Hut I have studied Islam lor 1 I
\ears back in Pakistan under the< un ieuluni
administered I)\ (lambridgc I T niversit\. so I
believe I can convey a viewpoint that is
shared by the luajoritv of the western s( hol
ars of religion.
I believe some of the assertions made in
Rob Camlet's column are rather con
tentious and may wrongly influence readci s
who have .i very supet fie ial understanding
of my religion. I do not wish to oppose the
author's notion of violence in some wa\
being associated wit h .ill religions, ik >i prove
that Muslims havealwavsacted peaceliillv. 1
just feel the author has, perhaps inadver
tently, managed to taint the image ol our
I loly Prophet and his fbllowet s b\ tailing to
appreciate the c(mtext in which e.u b of the
mentioned actions was carried out. I his also
seems to have created the impression tii.it
Islam is by nature a faith that entourages its
followers to resort to violent means to
achieve their objectives.
Caudet suggests that the Pledge of War
taken In the followers of Muhammad in 022
A.I). was with an intent of fighting tor inoii
etaiy and personal gain. 1 'his argument
seems rather weak in light of the fact that
022 is the vear when Muslims bad sec ret h

migrated Irom Mcn.i to Medina in a bid to
eseape the tvranny and persecution of the
non-Muslims ol Mecca who saw Islam as a
grow ing threat to their dominance. (lod or
dered the Muslims to he prepared to fight
because the Meccans would obvious!) ;ii
tempt to light the Muslims at Medina. I his
vei se ol the Quran was simply revealed as
ollic ial permission Irom Cod lor the Mus
lims to take up armed struggle against
their opponents lor the first time since
failure to do so would result in their
prompt elimination.

ated with such a (aravan which was believed
to be part (>f the Meccan wai designs.
Nations alwa\s do their best to delend
themselves against potential threats. I can't
help noticing that even Amerk .i in the 21 st
(cniui \ bombed Mghanistan and Sudan
without am concrete evidence of their in
volvement in the .American etnbass\ bomb
ings in 112 ast Africa.
I o(all Muhammad a "trench-digger, pi
rate and warlord'" is downright offensive.
I he Irene h was dug outside the (it\ when
the Muslims were only 3,000 in number
themselves and had to fight 30,000 Mecca
ns. What could have been an extremel)
blood\ war was reduced to a stalemate in
which less than 10 people died and the Mec
(ans were ultitnateh 112( »rt ed to return home.
Muhammad al\\.i\s led the Muslims in
battle and collecting the hoot\ aftet victon
was both a tradition of the time and ven
netess.uA lor the Muslims, most ol whom
were the poor people of Arabia who em
brae ed Islam since it guaranteed them fun
damental human rights. Collecting the
boot\ after a fail victon in the battlefield
provided them with the financial and mili
tar\ strength to go on spreading Islam.
Km tli.it does not mean that Islam was
evet spread at the point ola sword. ()u the
contrary, when Muslim armies arrived at
the frontiers of new lands, tliev would give

11 it* opposing armies three options: accept
Islam, do not accept Islam I >ut con if under
our sovereignty and pay us a special tax. 01
prepare for war. I 'lie willingness to go out
lot wai was there simply because such was
the instruction ot ( iod who sought the way
lor Islam to spread as last and wide as possi
ble. I he obligation of paying tax as a non-
Muslim in the empire was lair enough il you
consider that such people were then given
equal status to Muslims, who paid theii o\\ n
religious taxes, in all administrative mallei s.
11 lis is probahh the most c i\ il treatment ol
minorities \ou can find in an empire in the
titli and 7th century.
I rue, Muhammad had do/ens of wives
but niai rving a woman as a svmbol of lorg
ing a bond with her tube- again was a tradi

to communicate the message of Islam. I i il »-
