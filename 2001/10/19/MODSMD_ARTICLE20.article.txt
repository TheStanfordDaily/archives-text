Law student disputes Gaudet's assertions,
opinions
While Rob (iaudet 's column Wednesday
had mam insightful points, his general tone
and implic.nions were offensive io main
Muslims on tlu* Stan lord (ampus. Probablv
(he most offensive statement (iaudet made
was io (lann tli.it "Islam was not inherently
|x*ac clul." I agree wit It (iaudet on this point
to an extent, since I believe that Islam is not
"inherently" anything. Islam is a vast thing,
lull of a range ol expressions, and a multi
plicitv ol histories.
Islam is much more of a pliant, shifting
.ind organic system ol heliels than how
(iaudet seems to understand it. I hat is not.
however, to say that any belief can I.ill under
the umbrella of Islam. When (iaudet points
to the apparent inconsistencies between the
rhetoric ol Islam as a peaceful religion and
largeb isolated instances of violence in the
Muslim world, it is not at all surprising.
It reminds me ol Walt Whitman, when
he wrote. "Do I contradict myself? Yes, for I
contain multitudes." Islam has many
types of adherents, 112 rom all walks of life,
from all sorts of politic a I persuasions, vi
olent and non-violent.
(iaudet is crafty with his words, because
lu- never savs. "Islam is inherently violent."
But what he does not explicitly sav, the con
notative thrust of his article strongly insinu
ates. l or example, (iaudet gives a number
of examples from the Quran and the life of
Muhammad as incontrovertible proof that

Islam is not inherently peaceful. These ex
amples purport to show, or ;it least st rough
suggest, that there is .1 sinistei or violent side
todoctrinal Islam.
I Ins is .111 ironic statement considering it
is very, very difficult to .ist ertain the "11 uth"
about earl\ Islam from .1 <I(h trinal or histor
ical point of view. Most Islamic scholars are
painfully aware that there hundred of ac
counts of the life of Muhammad, and that it
is nearly impossible to locate tlu- "true" bio
graphical Muhammad from this bewilder
ing numtier of sources, some laudatory and
even some which are deprecatory towards
him. from both Muslim and non-Muslim
sources. It is dear that (iaudet's narrative
was a cynical understanding of the
Prophet's alleged actions, and it must alsolx*
understood that (iaudet's(haracteri/ations
of Muhammad and early doctrinal Islam
are his own, and hardly accepted "truths"
from either the traditional Islamic point of
view or even Western scholarship. For ex
ample, many scholars might stronglv dis
agree* with (iaudet's (haracteii/ation ol the
Pledge of Acjaha as a senseless or unneces
sarily bellicose "Pledge ol War."
Many Muslims would also strongly dis
agree with (iaudet's gloss of Prophet
Muhammad as a plundering pit ate, who al
legedly slaughtered 70 people, (iaudet
should keep in mind that many of the inci
dents reported alx>ut Muhammad are any
thing but authenticated. Many of the "au
thentic" accounts of Muhammad were c om
piled hundreds of years after his death.

(«audet should ii<>i parade them around as
indisputable lac Is as lie did in his column
vestcrdav, especially given the source dis
< rcpam-ies in earl) Islam. At Ik-si, we can see
(.audel s "la* Is .is interpretations based on
problem, iti* sou ices, (..unlet will be more
sophisticated when he realizes thai truth is
often .1 discursive fiuu lion.
lu an article about peace and violence,
(•audel finds it necessary to discuss the al
leged sexual history ol the Prophet, lie
writes sarcastically, "Muhammad had
dozens of wives and concubines, and almost
.ill his marriages were political alliances. I le
miisi have had a big heart to love so many
women. Ihe sarcasm is unwarranted.
(»audet s imperious tone is evident when he
says, | Muhammad] did it for the b<x)ty" or
that the motivation lor Islamic proselytiza
tion was"for riches." Apparently, (>audet
can distill character motivation from 1,100
hundred years in the past.
I -isily, RobC»andet should see that most
ly s<H'ial good has come out ol the rhetoric
that Islam stems fr<>lll |>eace." I)( h's( >audet
not realize how maligned Muslims have
been in the media, and how maligned they
continue to her Did (>audct not see the
cover ol Newsweek and I ime where yelling
Muslim men with turbans and rifles appear
like violent lunatics?
Does (•audel not see the social function
ol (ailing Islam a peaceful religion, when
countless Muslims are being harassed on ac
