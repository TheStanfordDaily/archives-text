MEN S SOCCER

Tonight: No. 2 Stanford vs.
California, 7:30 p.m., New
Moloney Field.
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford at
Santa Gara, 6 p.m., Santa
Clara, CA.

Yet Stanford has proven re
silient in recent years. Since 1997,
the Cardinal has not losi hack-to
hat k panics and has won nine ol its
last 10 games alter a loss.
" 1 his is .i very big weekend lor
us," said senior midfielder Derek
Shanahan. "We now have our first
loss and we realized that we're not
untoiu liable. We liave a renewed
si nst- < >1 what we need to do to win.
"We know that we're a good
team and we have confidence, hut
we just needed a reminder that
we need to put in the dirty work
and pay attention to the small
things and that having skill
doesn't mean that things w ill net -
cssarih go voui way." he added.
I he Cardinal and the Colden
Bears have a common trait —
hotli teams lost to UCLA in their
conference opener. Despite this
loss, ( al is on an earh season roll.
I his was only its second loss in its
past seven games.
While the two teams competed
in the same two early season tour
naments, this Friday will mark the
first time that the teams meet on

the field. Last year, Stanford de
feated Cal twice — shutting the
Colden Bears out hoth times hy a
score of 3-0.
I listorically, Stanford has over
whelmed Cal, with a 21-7-5 series
record. Stanford has also held a
considerable home-field advan
tage over Cal. I he Colden Bears
have not won on Stanford turf
since 1981.
" 1 here is always the typical Cal
versus Stanford rivalry," said
sophomore Mike Wilson. "We
have to mentally get prepared
again. Obviously every team we
pla\ is different and games are al
ways a new challenge. Cal will
certainly not be a pushover and
we just need to be focused and
not let what happened at UCLA
happen again."
1 he weekend play certainly
does not get any easier for the Car
dinal. Sunday's game brings the
( ardinal another tough opponent
in Santa ('.lata.
I he Broncos are coming off of a
huge WCC win ovct then-No. 8
San Diego State. Before this game,
Santa ( lara had been pit ked to fin
ish second behind San Diego State
in the W( IC.
l lie series record between
these two teams is much tighter
than the Cal-Stanford tally,
adding to the antagonism be
