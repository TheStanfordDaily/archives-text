# STANFORD'S SUPER SEER
## 
### 
So for this yeor the super seer has taken on the Pac-10 with accuracy that would moke Miss Cleo
jealous. The omniscient oracle stands 19-2 in conference play. But this week presents two new
challenges A rising USC team and Cal vs. the No. 6 Bruins. Well, maybe one challenge.
Texas COL National game of the week:
[33 271 While this contest may have no national title implications for its two participants, No 8
Texas better have its horns reared for the No. 17 Buffoloes rushing attack If the Long
horns lose, be ready for the Lone Star faithful to call for quarterback Chris Simms head
On a side note a Colorado win tomorrow would do wonders for No 10 Fresno States
BCS hopes, as the Bulldogs beat Colorado in the Buffaloes season opener.
UCLA CAL
CC H UCLA gets its chance to pod its statistics against the Pac-10's doormat Hey Oregon, 48
' points, is that all you could do?*
ND USC
O A 1H Is Notre Dame the biggest group of underachieves out there? Can the Irish beat their
biggest rival? Is Bob Davie's job in serious leopardy? Yes, yes and yes
ORE STAN
A? QC Key defensive in|uries on both teams should turn this into an exciting shootout. Contrary to
popular belief, the Stanford band s return to Oregon won I be the deciding factor
WASH ARIZ
C | The way Arizona's "Desert Scorn" defense has been giving up points this year Washing-
'ton could hit triple-digits.
OSU ASU
133 211 Ken Simonton may have found his confidence, so look out Pac-10. Arizona State sof-
fense is unpredictable though, and Jeff Krohn's quarterbacking is underrated.
