campaign for two years ant! is the driving
force behind this year's protest.
"Many black students from the ( lass

on a program at the ('.olio last year,
which consisted of spoken word poctn
and profiles of police brutality victims."
she said.
" I bis year, we are passing out black

i ibboiis ,md we are asking people to dress
in all blat k on both Sunday and Monday
as a gesture of solidarity," she added.
Junior Mvisha Patterson, president of
Stanford's NAAC.P, recalled the success
of last year's event.
"It seems like the perfect event for the
NAA( P to endorse," she said.
According to Holman, the NAACP
hopes to convey that violence like this
happens everyday not far from Stanford.
"Hopefully her speech will open the
Stanford community's eyes to the reality
of 'such injustices." Holman said.
"It's so easy to get into the mentality
that things like this only happen in far off
plates, under extreme circumstances,"

she said. "But that's just not the case."
MKChA, a Chicano / Latino student
group, will also play a prominent role in
Sunday's protest. Ihe organization is
putting together a display 10 acknowl
edge those who have been killed b\ the
Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vices while trying to cross the border.
"This problem transcends rat e, it's an
attack on an entire generation," said Pat
terson. "1 think it would be a shame to
walk into the ("olio Sunday night and
only see faces of color.
"The night would be a failure in the eyes
of the NAAC.IV she said. "It would mean
that we weren't able to reach people, to
unite people, in the way that we want to."
