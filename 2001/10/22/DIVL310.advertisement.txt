We may be an investment firm, but our Ph.D.s outnumber our MBAs.
The D. E. Shaw group was founded (by a former Columbia University
computer science professor) to explore the intersection between
technology and finance. Since 1988 we've grown into a number of
closely related entities with more than US $2 billion in aggregate
capital. Our strategy is to hire smart people from a wide range of back
grounds and let them implement—and manage—what they invent.
The firm currently has openings in its algorithmic trading and
technology venture businesses, including roles in trading, software
development, quantitative analysis, and business development.
We're looking for creative but pragmatic people: articulate, curious,
and driven. Our working environment is intense but surprisingly
casual. We provide unusual opportunities for growth. And we com
pensate extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
D. E. Shaw & Co. will be holding an information session on Monday,
October 22 at 7 pm in the Gold Lounge of the Faculty Club.
