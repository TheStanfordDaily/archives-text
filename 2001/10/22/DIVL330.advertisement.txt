P.J. O'Rourke has toured the fighting in Bosnia, visited
the West Bank disguised as P.J. of Arabia, lobbed one-liners
on the battlefields of the Gulf War, and traded quips with
Communist rebels in the jungles of the Philippines. Now,
in the CEO of the Soft, he embarks on a mission to the
most frightening place of all—his own home. Ensconced
on the domestic boardroom's throne(although not
supposed to put his feet on its cushions), he faces a
three-year old who wants a cell phone and a free-lance
career devoted to writing articles like "Chewing-Mouth
Dogs Bring Hope to People with Eating Disorders ". Now
in a debut appearance, he will brave the Stanford Bookstore
to deliver the comedic wisdom of his personal adventures
in and out of the home. Don't miss this rare
opportunity to hear one of America's funniest authors!
