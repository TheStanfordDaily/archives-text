112 urthermore, religion is evolving and

What practical value does ( ategori/ing

I he words of peace and love are faith

Allah is mere iIi11 and kind, and that does

Gaudet's column oversimplifies,
misinterprets the Qur'an
()ne b.isit rule in slut lying the Qui an is
to take it as a whole. I lit* contents ol the
Qur an arc not classified subject-wise, the
verses on various topics appear in dis
persed plat es and no particular order can
be ascertained in the sequence of its texts.
So it is erroneous to take a single verse and
make judgement upon it.
" I hc occasion of revelation" is very im
portant as it tells the t ircumstances and
events in which a verse was revealed to
Muhammad. As in studying history, the
historical context is extremely important
in knowing why a certain event look plate
and not another, why some people acted
in a certain way and not another.
When the prophethood of Muhammad
started, he was in Meet a. When he started
to talk to people about Islam, he was
sironglv opposed In the polvtheists who
persct utcd the converts to Islam. I he rea
son was that Islam t alis lor the worship til
one (kid and the equality of all mankind.
Anyone revealing his faith was aggressive
ly tortured and sometimes killed, regard
less of the month. I lie Arabs hat 1 a tradi
tion of not aggressing during four months
of the lunar year; these months are called
the "112 orbidden Months."

\ ci sr 2:21 7 ol the Om an was revealed
to Muhammad to comment on a raid that
captured a < aravan and two Meccans and
lilt one Meccan dead without an order
Irom the Prophet. When the\ returned to
Medina, Muhammad and the Muslims in
Medina rebuked them f<>i doing so and
Muhammad suspended am action with
respect to the c aravan and the two prison
ers. Siii( c the raid was on the last da\ ola
forbidden month, the Meccans started a
propaganda campaign denigrating the
Muslims. I'lie raiders were ver\ ashamed
ol themselves because 11ie\ lelt the\ inipli
(ated the Muslim ( onununit\.
\t this critical moment, this verse- was
re-sealed expounding that it is wrong to
light ma forbidden month, but what is
more detestable is oppressing the Muslims
lor about 13 vcai s, even during the for
bidden months. Muhammad paid com
pensation to the deceased's lamilv (as was
thee ustoin of the Arabs) and I reed the two
captives. As a statesman, Muhammad dc
(ideel to keep the c aravan and distributed
the spoils among the oppressed and the
poor w ho started a new life in Medina.
\evei at the time ol Muhammad was
an\ war fought lor riches. I he obvious
counterevidence is that it is obligators in
Islam to mlorin people belore attac king. II
anvone is going for the riches, common
sense die tales keeping the mission < landes
tine to inaxiinize the possibilities ol \ i( torv.
War m Islam (militars jihad) is waged
tor two reasons: sell-defense or to lice
people from unjust oppressive regimes so
thai the\ would be able to "choose" to be
lieve- in (iod.
I wo basic principles in Islam are that
there is "no compulsion in religion" and
that jihad must be clone lor the sake of
(iod, not lor liune, booty, or am personal
interest. W hat \llah wants from Muslims is
to spread piety, freedom, justice, equality,
morality and self-discipline.
Another controversial issue- about
Muhammad is that he had 1 1 wives in all
and nine .it one time. I lie most impor
tant point is to view this within its histori
cal context, when unlimited polygamy
w as common. Muhammad did not marry
am ol them for carnal desires. II he did,
he would not have been the young man
who was married for 25 years to one
woman 15 years his senior. He was 25
when he married khadijah and he lived
all his youth with her. When slu- died, he
called that year "the year of grief." He
loved, respected and kept praising her
until his death.
Alter her death, he began to marry his
other wives. These marriages were not for
political alliances but for several other
reasons, First, his wives learned Islam
from him and taught its morals, values
and rituals to the rest of the community
(especially the women) who did not have
enough chance to accompany Muham

mad, who was .1 prophet and .1 statesman
at the same time.
Second, the wives narrated .1 lot about
Ins lamih life, including (lie most private
and personal aspec ts of it. I hud, he mar
ried the daughters of his two chief sup
porters to strengthen his relationships
with them on the personal level.
Fourth, he married widows to lionoi
theii deceased husbands, who gave their
li\es loi Islam, and to take care of them
and their orphans, l ifth. the Arabs had
certain habits in marriage that were abro
gated bv Islam. One marriage ol the
Prophet was to set new legislative rules re
garding marriage and adoption.
Muhammad must have had .1 vet \ big
heart to persist in teaching about Allah
and withstanding all offenses and hard
ships. I le must have had a ver\ big heart
to be stoned In people onh because he was
telling them to believe in one (lot I. and vet
asking (iod to guide them to his true path
instead of punishing them. 1 le had a mes
sage to deliver and indeed he delivered it.
Bernard Shaw wrote 111 one of Ins arti
cles, "1 have always held the religion of
Muhammad in high estimation because of
its wonderful vitality, h is the onh religion
whic h appears to me to possess that assim
ilating capac ity to the changing phase of
existence whic h can make itsell appeal to
ever) age. 1 have studied him — the won
derful man and in m\ opinion far from
being an anti-Christ, he must be called the
Saviot of I himanitv."

Columnist Gaudet responds to Friday's
letter from Tanvir Rahman
Even though I am a I.in of Walt Whit
man. I think I anvir Rahman is errant in
applying Whitman's egocentric quote —
"I contain multitudes" — to the modern
day practice of Islam.
Most Muslims would not accept Rah
man's suggestion that Islam "contain(s)
multitudes" because it would be a pure
heresy. It might represent the views of
liberal secularists at Stanford but it does
not represent the beliefs of millions of
Muslims around the world. One of the
main objections of Muslims to human
rights is the fact that human rights are as
sertions made by an individual. In Islam,
the individual has no inherent worth.
1 understand the argument that "Islam
is pliant" because I used it myself in a
paper titled "Human Rights in Islam."
Sadly, my and Rahman's belief in the pli
ancy ol Islam is not shared by millions ofits
practitioners. All religions, to the extent
they are sen ial institutions, adapt to new
times and cultures. Islam, however, is

unique in ilic lac 1 iliat the Put an is not
amenable 10 modern interpretation. It
was di\ me revelation, lull stop.
M\ column summarized the narrative
provided In world-renowned scholar
Willi.llll Montgomen Watt in "Islam: A
Short History." I read a previous book In*
Watt as .111 undergraduate. His book was
assigned 011 the basis ol its scholarship,
c Un ity and historic al accuracy. I did not, as
Rahman alleges, portra\ m\ own "cynical
understanding' ol the Prophet's life, mar
ital life, raids or killings. 1 nierel) sunmia
rized Watt's narrative. ()ther books say the
same things.
1 he Prophet's personal lile is fair game
in an\ discussion of Islam. Most Muslims
toda\ follow a both ol writings c alled "the
hat lit IT' w hie h gives great detail about the
Prophet's early habits and manners.
It is true that Muhammad had many
wives and conc übines. Ii is also true that
I used a sarcastic tone w hen I said that he
inust've had a big heart to love them all.
I hat s because he married most of them
for political reasons. Ihe marriages of
medieval Europe were, perhaps, some
what similar. I he idea ol marriage for
love is probabb |ust a romantic Western
concept. I admire a man who can start a
new faith, develop .111 expansive empire
and keep up relations with numerous
women. I have enough trouble with one
girlfriend. Ihe many wives of Muham
mad are proof enough, to nit*, that he
had divine help.
1 agree that some social good has come
out of the president's benevolent distor
tion ol Islam. I lowevcr. this is supposed to
be an institution of higher learning. If we
can't get it right at Stanford, then the rest
of the world might as well give up.
I'm not prepared to throw in the
towel and transform every religion into
some form ol the Hari krishnas (my
apologies to the Hari Krishnas of Stan
ford whose music and philosophy 1
enjoy). I he I'niversity should be a safe
haven Irom the propaganda and manip
ulation ol the press. I believe the Prophet
was ingenious, spiritual and brilliant.
Hut that doesn't make him immune from
critical analysis.
As a personal aside, I do think that
Islam is a beautiful religion. I prayed in
the Muslim mosque in I lebton during an
afternoon prayer service. It was the most
beautiful service I've ever attended. I
would love to goon "hajj" (a pilgrimage) to
Mecca and circumambulate the ka'bah,
but its not allowed for non-Muslims.
1 hat's a simple lad I have to accept. Simi
larly, Rahman and the Stanford Muslims
are grappling with the "lesser" struggle
with the relevance of Islam's background
and the I ioly Prophet to their own lives.

Gaudet's column oversimplifies,
misinterprets the Qur'an
()ne b.isit rule in slut lying the Qui an is
to take it as a whole. I lit* contents ol the
Qur an arc not classified subject-wise, the
verses on various topics appear in dis
persed plat es and no particular order can
be ascertained in the sequence of its texts.
So it is erroneous to take a single verse and
make judgement upon it.
" I hc occasion of revelation" is very im
portant as it tells the t ircumstances and
events in which a verse was revealed to
Muhammad. As in studying history, the
historical context is extremely important
in knowing why a certain event look plate
and not another, why some people acted
in a certain way and not another.
When the prophethood of Muhammad
started, he was in Meet a. When he started
to talk to people about Islam, he was
sironglv opposed In the polvtheists who
persct utcd the converts to Islam. I he rea
son was that Islam t alis lor the worship til
one (kid and the equality of all mankind.
Anyone revealing his faith was aggressive
ly tortured and sometimes killed, regard
less of the month. I lie Arabs hat 1 a tradi
tion of not aggressing during four months
of the lunar year; these months are called
the "112 orbidden Months."

\ ci sr 2:21 7 ol the Om an was revealed
to Muhammad to comment on a raid that
captured a < aravan and two Meccans and
lilt one Meccan dead without an order
Irom the Prophet. When the\ returned to
Medina, Muhammad and the Muslims in
Medina rebuked them f<>i doing so and
Muhammad suspended am action with
respect to the c aravan and the two prison
ers. Siii( c the raid was on the last da\ ola
forbidden month, the Meccans started a
propaganda campaign denigrating the
Muslims. I'lie raiders were ver\ ashamed
ol themselves because 11ie\ lelt the\ inipli
(ated the Muslim ( onununit\.
\t this critical moment, this verse- was
re-sealed expounding that it is wrong to
light ma forbidden month, but what is
more detestable is oppressing the Muslims
lor about 13 vcai s, even during the for
bidden months. Muhammad paid com
pensation to the deceased's lamilv (as was
thee ustoin of the Arabs) and I reed the two
captives. As a statesman, Muhammad dc
(ideel to keep the c aravan and distributed
the spoils among the oppressed and the
poor w ho started a new life in Medina.
\evei at the time ol Muhammad was
an\ war fought lor riches. I he obvious
counterevidence is that it is obligators in
Islam to mlorin people belore attac king. II
anvone is going for the riches, common
sense die tales keeping the mission < landes
tine to inaxiinize the possibilities ol \ i( torv.
War m Islam (militars jihad) is waged
tor two reasons: sell-defense or to lice
people from unjust oppressive regimes so
thai the\ would be able to "choose" to be
lieve- in (iod.
I wo basic principles in Islam are that
there is "no compulsion in religion" and
that jihad must be clone lor the sake of
(iod, not lor liune, booty, or am personal
interest. W hat \llah wants from Muslims is
to spread piety, freedom, justice, equality,
morality and self-discipline.
Another controversial issue- about
Muhammad is that he had 1 1 wives in all
and nine .it one time. I lie most impor
tant point is to view this within its histori
cal context, when unlimited polygamy
w as common. Muhammad did not marry
am ol them for carnal desires. II he did,
he would not have been the young man
who was married for 25 years to one
woman 15 years his senior. He was 25
when he married khadijah and he lived
all his youth with her. When slu- died, he
called that year "the year of grief." He
loved, respected and kept praising her
until his death.
Alter her death, he began to marry his
other wives. These marriages were not for
political alliances but for several other
reasons, First, his wives learned Islam
from him and taught its morals, values
and rituals to the rest of the community
(especially the women) who did not have
enough chance to accompany Muham

mad, who was .1 prophet and .1 statesman
at the same time.
Second, the wives narrated .1 lot about
Ins lamih life, including (lie most private
and personal aspec ts of it. I hud, he mar
ried the daughters of his two chief sup
porters to strengthen his relationships
with them on the personal level.
Fourth, he married widows to lionoi
theii deceased husbands, who gave their
li\es loi Islam, and to take care of them
and their orphans, l ifth. the Arabs had
certain habits in marriage that were abro
gated bv Islam. One marriage ol the
Prophet was to set new legislative rules re
garding marriage and adoption.
Muhammad must have had .1 vet \ big
heart to persist in teaching about Allah
and withstanding all offenses and hard
ships. I le must have had a ver\ big heart
to be stoned In people onh because he was
telling them to believe in one (lot I. and vet
asking (iod to guide them to his true path
instead of punishing them. 1 le had a mes
sage to deliver and indeed he delivered it.
Bernard Shaw wrote 111 one of Ins arti
cles, "1 have always held the religion of
Muhammad in high estimation because of
its wonderful vitality, h is the onh religion
whic h appears to me to possess that assim
ilating capac ity to the changing phase of

Columnist Gaudet responds to Friday's
letter from Tanvir Rahman
Even though I am a I.in of Walt Whit
man. I think I anvir Rahman is errant in
applying Whitman's egocentric quote —
"I contain multitudes" — to the modern
day practice of Islam.
Most Muslims would not accept Rah
man's suggestion that Islam "contain(s)
multitudes" because it would be a pure
heresy. It might represent the views of
liberal secularists at Stanford but it does
not represent the beliefs of millions of
Muslims around the world. One of the
main objections of Muslims to human
rights is the fact that human rights are as
sertions made by an individual. In Islam,
the individual has no inherent worth.
1 understand the argument that "Islam
is pliant" because I used it myself in a
paper titled "Human Rights in Islam."
Sadly, my and Rahman's belief in the pli
ancy ol Islam is not shared by millions ofits
practitioners. All religions, to the extent
they are sen ial institutions, adapt to new
times and cultures. Islam, however, is

unique in ilic lac 1 iliat the Put an is not

Rahman alleges, portra\ m\ own "cynical

ital life, raids or killings. 1 nierel) sunmia

same things.
1 he Prophet's personal lile is fair game
in an\ discussion of Islam. Most Muslims
toda\ follow a both ol writings c alled "the

Prophet's early habits and manners.
It is true that Muhammad had many
wives and conc übines. Ii is also true that
I used a sarcastic tone w hen I said that he
inust've had a big heart to love them all.
I hat s because he married most of them
for political reasons. Ihe marriages of
medieval Europe were, perhaps, some
what similar. I he idea ol marriage for

concept. I admire a man who can start a
new faith, develop .111 expansive empire
and keep up relations with numerous
women. I have enough trouble with one
girlfriend. Ihe many wives of Muham
mad are proof enough, to nit*, that he
had divine help.
1 agree that some social good has come
out of the president's benevolent distor
tion ol Islam. I lowevcr. this is supposed to
be an institution of higher learning. If we
can't get it right at Stanford, then the rest
of the world might as well give up.
I'm not prepared to throw in the

some form ol the Hari krishnas (my
apologies to the Hari Krishnas of Stan
ford whose music and philosophy 1
enjoy). I he I'niversity should be a safe
haven Irom the propaganda and manip
ulation ol the press. I believe the Prophet
was ingenious, spiritual and brilliant.
Hut that doesn't make him immune from
critical analysis.
As a personal aside, I do think that
Islam is a beautiful religion. I prayed in
the Muslim mosque in I lebton during an
afternoon prayer service. It was the most
beautiful service I've ever attended. I
would love to goon "hajj" (a pilgrimage) to
Mecca and circumambulate the ka'bah,
but its not allowed for non-Muslims.
1 hat's a simple lad I have to accept. Simi

are grappling with the "lesser" struggle
with the relevance of Islam's background
and the I ioly Prophet to their own lives.

Gaudet's column oversimplifies,
misinterprets the Qur'an
()ne b.isit rule in slut lying the Qui an is
to take it as a whole. I lit* contents ol the
Qur an arc not classified subject-wise, the
verses on various topics appear in dis
persed plat es and no particular order can
be ascertained in the sequence of its texts.
So it is erroneous to take a single verse and
make judgement upon it.
" I hc occasion of revelation" is very im
portant as it tells the t ircumstances and
events in which a verse was revealed to
Muhammad. As in studying history, the
historical context is extremely important
in knowing why a certain event look plate
and not another, why some people acted
in a certain way and not another.
When the prophethood of Muhammad
started, he was in Meet a. When he started
to talk to people about Islam, he was
sironglv opposed In the polvtheists who
persct utcd the converts to Islam. I he rea
son was that Islam t alis lor the worship til
one (kid and the equality of all mankind.
Anyone revealing his faith was aggressive
ly tortured and sometimes killed, regard
less of the month. I lie Arabs hat 1 a tradi
tion of not aggressing during four months
of the lunar year; these months are called
the "112 orbidden Months."

\ ci sr 2:21 7 ol the Om an was revealed
to Muhammad to comment on a raid that
captured a < aravan and two Meccans and
lilt one Meccan dead without an order
Irom the Prophet. When the\ returned to
Medina, Muhammad and the Muslims in
Medina rebuked them f<>i doing so and
Muhammad suspended am action with
respect to the c aravan and the two prison
ers. Siii( c the raid was on the last da\ ola
forbidden month, the Meccans started a
propaganda campaign denigrating the
Muslims. I'lie raiders were ver\ ashamed
ol themselves because 11ie\ lelt the\ inipli
(ated the Muslim ( onununit\.
\t this critical moment, this verse- was
re-sealed expounding that it is wrong to
light ma forbidden month, but what is
more detestable is oppressing the Muslims
lor about 13 vcai s, even during the for
bidden months. Muhammad paid com
pensation to the deceased's lamilv (as was
thee ustoin of the Arabs) and I reed the two
captives. As a statesman, Muhammad dc
(ideel to keep the c aravan and distributed
the spoils among the oppressed and the
poor w ho started a new life in Medina.
\evei at the time ol Muhammad was
an\ war fought lor riches. I he obvious
counterevidence is that it is obligators in
Islam to mlorin people belore attac king. II
anvone is going for the riches, common
sense die tales keeping the mission < landes
tine to inaxiinize the possibilities ol \ i( torv.
War m Islam (militars jihad) is waged
tor two reasons: sell-defense or to lice
people from unjust oppressive regimes so
thai the\ would be able to "choose" to be
lieve- in (iod.
I wo basic principles in Islam are that
there is "no compulsion in religion" and
that jihad must be clone lor the sake of
(iod, not lor liune, booty, or am personal
interest. W hat \llah wants from Muslims is
to spread piety, freedom, justice, equality,
morality and self-discipline.
Another controversial issue- about
Muhammad is that he had 1 1 wives in all
and nine .it one time. I lie most impor
tant point is to view this within its histori
cal context, when unlimited polygamy
w as common. Muhammad did not marry
am ol them for carnal desires. II he did,
he would not have been the young man
who was married for 25 years to one
woman 15 years his senior. He was 25
when he married khadijah and he lived
all his youth with her. When slu- died, he
called that year "the year of grief." He
loved, respected and kept praising her
until his death.
Alter her death, he began to marry his
other wives. These marriages were not for
political alliances but for several other
reasons, First, his wives learned Islam
from him and taught its morals, values
and rituals to the rest of the community
(especially the women) who did not have
enough chance to accompany Muham

mad, who was .1 prophet and .1 statesman
at the same time.
Second, the wives narrated .1 lot about
Ins lamih life, including (lie most private
and personal aspec ts of it. I hud, he mar
ried the daughters of his two chief sup
porters to strengthen his relationships
with them on the personal level.
Fourth, he married widows to lionoi
theii deceased husbands, who gave their
li\es loi Islam, and to take care of them
and their orphans, l ifth. the Arabs had
certain habits in marriage that were abro
gated bv Islam. One marriage ol the
Prophet was to set new legislative rules re
garding marriage and adoption.
Muhammad must have had .1 vet \ big
heart to persist in teaching about Allah
and withstanding all offenses and hard
ships. I le must have had a ver\ big heart
to be stoned In people onh because he was
telling them to believe in one (lot I. and vet
asking (iod to guide them to his true path
instead of punishing them. 1 le had a mes
sage to deliver and indeed he delivered it.
Bernard Shaw wrote 111 one of Ins arti
cles, "1 have always held the religion of
Muhammad in high estimation because of
its wonderful vitality, h is the onh religion
whic h appears to me to possess that assim
ilating capac ity to the changing phase of

Columnist Gaudet responds to Friday's
letter from Tanvir Rahman
Even though I am a I.in of Walt Whit
man. I think I anvir Rahman is errant in
applying Whitman's egocentric quote —
"I contain multitudes" — to the modern
day practice of Islam.
Most Muslims would not accept Rah
man's suggestion that Islam "contain(s)
multitudes" because it would be a pure
heresy. It might represent the views of
liberal secularists at Stanford but it does
not represent the beliefs of millions of
Muslims around the world. One of the
main objections of Muslims to human
rights is the fact that human rights are as
sertions made by an individual. In Islam,
the individual has no inherent worth.
1 understand the argument that "Islam
is pliant" because I used it myself in a
paper titled "Human Rights in Islam."
Sadly, my and Rahman's belief in the pli
ancy ol Islam is not shared by millions ofits
practitioners. All religions, to the extent
they are sen ial institutions, adapt to new
times and cultures. Islam, however, is

unique in ilic lac 1 iliat the Put an is not

was di\ me revelation, lull stop.

Watt as .111 undergraduate. His book was

Rahman alleges, portra\ m\ own "cynical
understanding' ol the Prophet's life, mar
ital life, raids or killings. 1 nierel) sunmia

same things.
1 he Prophet's personal lile is fair game
in an\ discussion of Islam. Most Muslims
toda\ follow a both ol writings c alled "the

Prophet's early habits and manners.
It is true that Muhammad had many
wives and conc übines. Ii is also true that
I used a sarcastic tone w hen I said that he
inust've had a big heart to love them all.
I hat s because he married most of them
for political reasons. Ihe marriages of
medieval Europe were, perhaps, some
what similar. I he idea ol marriage for
love is probabb |ust a romantic Western
concept. I admire a man who can start a
new faith, develop .111 expansive empire
and keep up relations with numerous
women. I have enough trouble with one
girlfriend. Ihe many wives of Muham
mad are proof enough, to nit*, that he
had divine help.
1 agree that some social good has come
out of the president's benevolent distor
tion ol Islam. I lowevcr. this is supposed to
be an institution of higher learning. If we
can't get it right at Stanford, then the rest
of the world might as well give up.
I'm not prepared to throw in the
towel and transform every religion into
some form ol the Hari krishnas (my
apologies to the Hari Krishnas of Stan
ford whose music and philosophy 1
enjoy). I he I'niversity should be a safe
haven Irom the propaganda and manip
ulation ol the press. I believe the Prophet
was ingenious, spiritual and brilliant.
Hut that doesn't make him immune from
critical analysis.
As a personal aside, I do think that
Islam is a beautiful religion. I prayed in
the Muslim mosque in I lebton during an
afternoon prayer service. It was the most
beautiful service I've ever attended. I
would love to goon "hajj" (a pilgrimage) to
Mecca and circumambulate the ka'bah,
but its not allowed for non-Muslims.
1 hat's a simple lad I have to accept. Simi

are grappling with the "lesser" struggle
with the relevance of Islam's background
and the I ioly Prophet to their own lives.

Gaudet's column oversimplifies,
misinterprets the Qur'an
()ne b.isit rule in slut lying the Qui an is
to take it as a whole. I lit* contents ol the
Qur an arc not classified subject-wise, the
verses on various topics appear in dis
persed plat es and no particular order can
be ascertained in the sequence of its texts.
So it is erroneous to take a single verse and
make judgement upon it.
" I hc occasion of revelation" is very im
portant as it tells the t ircumstances and
events in which a verse was revealed to
Muhammad. As in studying history, the
historical context is extremely important
in knowing why a certain event look plate
and not another, why some people acted
in a certain way and not another.
When the prophethood of Muhammad
started, he was in Meet a. When he started
to talk to people about Islam, he was
sironglv opposed In the polvtheists who
persct utcd the converts to Islam. I he rea
son was that Islam t alis lor the worship til
one (kid and the equality of all mankind.
Anyone revealing his faith was aggressive
ly tortured and sometimes killed, regard
less of the month. I lie Arabs hat 1 a tradi
tion of not aggressing during four months
of the lunar year; these months are called
the "112 orbidden Months."

\ ci sr 2:21 7 ol the Om an was revealed
to Muhammad to comment on a raid that
captured a < aravan and two Meccans and
lilt one Meccan dead without an order
Irom the Prophet. When the\ returned to
Medina, Muhammad and the Muslims in
Medina rebuked them f<>i doing so and
Muhammad suspended am action with
respect to the c aravan and the two prison
ers. Siii( c the raid was on the last da\ ola
forbidden month, the Meccans started a
propaganda campaign denigrating the
Muslims. I'lie raiders were ver\ ashamed
ol themselves because 11ie\ lelt the\ inipli
(ated the Muslim ( onununit\.
\t this critical moment, this verse- was
re-sealed expounding that it is wrong to
light ma forbidden month, but what is
more detestable is oppressing the Muslims
lor about 13 vcai s, even during the for
bidden months. Muhammad paid com
pensation to the deceased's lamilv (as was
thee ustoin of the Arabs) and I reed the two
captives. As a statesman, Muhammad dc
(ideel to keep the c aravan and distributed
the spoils among the oppressed and the
poor w ho started a new life in Medina.
\evei at the time ol Muhammad was
an\ war fought lor riches. I he obvious
counterevidence is that it is obligators in
Islam to mlorin people belore attac king. II
anvone is going for the riches, common
sense die tales keeping the mission < landes
tine to inaxiinize the possibilities ol \ i( torv.
War m Islam (militars jihad) is waged
tor two reasons: sell-defense or to lice
people from unjust oppressive regimes so
thai the\ would be able to "choose" to be
lieve- in (iod.
I wo basic principles in Islam are that
there is "no compulsion in religion" and
that jihad must be clone lor the sake of
(iod, not lor liune, booty, or am personal
interest. W hat \llah wants from Muslims is
to spread piety, freedom, justice, equality,
morality and self-discipline.
Another controversial issue- about
Muhammad is that he had 1 1 wives in all
and nine .it one time. I lie most impor
tant point is to view this within its histori
cal context, when unlimited polygamy
w as common. Muhammad did not marry
am ol them for carnal desires. II he did,
he would not have been the young man
who was married for 25 years to one
woman 15 years his senior. He was 25
when he married khadijah and he lived
all his youth with her. When slu- died, he
called that year "the year of grief." He
loved, respected and kept praising her
until his death.
Alter her death, he began to marry his
other wives. These marriages were not for
political alliances but for several other
reasons, First, his wives learned Islam
from him and taught its morals, values
and rituals to the rest of the community
(especially the women) who did not have
enough chance to accompany Muham

mad, who was .1 prophet and .1 statesman
at the same time.
Second, the wives narrated .1 lot about
Ins lamih life, including (lie most private
and personal aspec ts of it. I hud, he mar
ried the daughters of his two chief sup
porters to strengthen his relationships
with them on the personal level.
Fourth, he married widows to lionoi
theii deceased husbands, who gave their
li\es loi Islam, and to take care of them
and their orphans, l ifth. the Arabs had
certain habits in marriage that were abro
gated bv Islam. One marriage ol the
Prophet was to set new legislative rules re
garding marriage and adoption.
Muhammad must have had .1 vet \ big
heart to persist in teaching about Allah
and withstanding all offenses and hard
ships. I le must have had a ver\ big heart
to be stoned In people onh because he was
telling them to believe in one (lot I. and vet
asking (iod to guide them to his true path
instead of punishing them. 1 le had a mes
sage to deliver and indeed he delivered it.
Bernard Shaw wrote 111 one of Ins arti
cles, "1 have always held the religion of
Muhammad in high estimation because of
its wonderful vitality, h is the onh religion
whic h appears to me to possess that assim
ilating capac ity to the changing phase of
existence whic h can make itsell appeal to
ever) age. 1 have studied him — the won
derful man and in m\ opinion far from
being an anti-Christ, he must be called the
Saviot of I himanitv."

Columnist Gaudet responds to Friday's
letter from Tanvir Rahman
Even though I am a I.in of Walt Whit
man. I think I anvir Rahman is errant in
applying Whitman's egocentric quote —
"I contain multitudes" — to the modern
day practice of Islam.
Most Muslims would not accept Rah
man's suggestion that Islam "contain(s)
multitudes" because it would be a pure
heresy. It might represent the views of
liberal secularists at Stanford but it does
not represent the beliefs of millions of
Muslims around the world. One of the
main objections of Muslims to human
rights is the fact that human rights are as
sertions made by an individual. In Islam,
the individual has no inherent worth.
1 understand the argument that "Islam
is pliant" because I used it myself in a
paper titled "Human Rights in Islam."
Sadly, my and Rahman's belief in the pli
ancy ol Islam is not shared by millions ofits
practitioners. All religions, to the extent
they are sen ial institutions, adapt to new
times and cultures. Islam, however, is

unique in ilic lac 1 iliat the Put an is not
amenable 10 modern interpretation. It
was di\ me revelation, lull stop.
M\ column summarized the narrative
provided In world-renowned scholar
Willi.llll Montgomen Watt in "Islam: A
Short History." I read a previous book In*
Watt as .111 undergraduate. His book was
assigned 011 the basis ol its scholarship,
c Un ity and historic al accuracy. I did not, as
Rahman alleges, portra\ m\ own "cynical
understanding' ol the Prophet's life, mar
ital life, raids or killings. 1 nierel) sunmia
rized Watt's narrative. ()ther books say the
same things.
1 he Prophet's personal lile is fair game
in an\ discussion of Islam. Most Muslims
toda\ follow a both ol writings c alled "the
hat lit IT' w hie h gives great detail about the
Prophet's early habits and manners.
It is true that Muhammad had many
wives and conc übines. Ii is also true that
I used a sarcastic tone w hen I said that he
inust've had a big heart to love them all.
I hat s because he married most of them
for political reasons. Ihe marriages of
medieval Europe were, perhaps, some
what similar. I he idea ol marriage for
love is probabb |ust a romantic Western
concept. I admire a man who can start a
new faith, develop .111 expansive empire
and keep up relations with numerous
women. I have enough trouble with one
girlfriend. Ihe many wives of Muham
mad are proof enough, to nit*, that he
had divine help.
1 agree that some social good has come
out of the president's benevolent distor
tion ol Islam. I lowevcr. this is supposed to
be an institution of higher learning. If we
can't get it right at Stanford, then the rest
of the world might as well give up.
I'm not prepared to throw in the
towel and transform every religion into
some form ol the Hari krishnas (my
apologies to the Hari Krishnas of Stan
ford whose music and philosophy 1
enjoy). I he I'niversity should be a safe
haven Irom the propaganda and manip
ulation ol the press. I believe the Prophet
was ingenious, spiritual and brilliant.
Hut that doesn't make him immune from
critical analysis.
As a personal aside, I do think that
Islam is a beautiful religion. I prayed in
the Muslim mosque in I lebton during an
afternoon prayer service. It was the most
beautiful service I've ever attended. I
would love to goon "hajj" (a pilgrimage) to
Mecca and circumambulate the ka'bah,
but its not allowed for non-Muslims.
1 hat's a simple lad I have to accept. Simi
larly, Rahman and the Stanford Muslims
are grappling with the "lesser" struggle
with the relevance of Islam's background
and the I ioly Prophet to their own lives.
