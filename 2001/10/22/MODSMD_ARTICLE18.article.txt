It imi'i the plax of the Ducks. Rather, it's

the zebras.
Perhaps better worded: It's the stupid /ebras.
It is true that officials are unlairix criticized.
I hex, for the most part, excellently determine
what happens in milliseconds.
On Saturday, though, the officials were so
ati<>< ious. spineless and gutless, one wondered if
there was a northwest eonspirae \ thcorx against
Stanford.
Recollections of a brutally officiated after
noon in I luskx Stadium in 1999 that nearly de
railed Stanford's run to the Rose Bowl danced
in my head.
On Stanford's first three plays from scrim
mage. calls were missed.
After the officials didn't notice two pass-inter
ference infractions and an off-side penally. who
would have known that those calls would onl\ be
previews of atrocious calls to come.

up a dropped hat kwards lateral and i an into the

Stanford a 28-21 lead.
I hough no of Ik ial Mew his whistle ruling the
pass incomplete, the referees had a eonfeictue
after the touchdown and determined that the
pass was indeed incomplete.
Mavhe visitors are not supposed to lead .it

Quack!
Stanford easih could have
blamed its tit-lit it 011 the ludicrous
officiating. Ranch Fasani's sprained
knee easih could have demoralized
Stanford. I he Stanford defenders
— many playing with one gtxxl
hand, one good arm and one good
leg — easih could have sutcuinbetl
to the elements. Stanford coaches
easih could have imploded with
anger and frustration.
Credit the Cardinal plavers and
