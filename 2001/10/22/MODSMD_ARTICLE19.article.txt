Ogonna Nnamani spat ked the Car

W ashington on Friday, .is Stanford
dished out its most lopsided win ol
the season to the I luskies.
Washington stumbled out ol the
blocks, falling behind 10-7 in the
opening game. File Cardinal held
itself to just a single hitting error in
the game and cruised to an easv M

helpless Washington squad man
aged to store just a single point on

its serve in the game.
Nnamani tallied eight kills in the
game while hitting .888 and the
Cardinal outliit the Huskies .514-
.057 — winning by an embarrassing
'M)-11 margin.
Washington showed some lile in
the third game, jumping out to an
I 1-7 lead thanks to some commu
nication lapses on Stanford's side of
the court. But the 112 luskies' rally
was (tit short as the Stanford attack
— led In five more kills from Nna
mani — got back into its grove.
Stanford recovered to dose the
night with a M-20 win in the third.
"I've been looking for that
groove lately, and I found it in a
few sec tions of the matt h tonight,"
said Nnamani, who finished with a
match-high 16 kills.
Though Stanford onlv trailed

the Cougars once in the entire
match, a gritty defensive [X'Hbr
mance by W ashington State gave
the ('.ardinal a hit more competition
on Saturday.
A solid passing perlbrmance let
tlu- ('.ardinal set the hall in the mid
dle consistently throughout the
match, allow ing sophomore middle
blocker Sara McC»ee to match bet
career high with 14 kills.
Kight blocks from senior middle
blocker l at a Conrad spearheaded
another strong performance from
the Cardinal's conference-leading
hI(H king game.
"()ur strategy every match, re
gardless of how we're passing, is
to set in the middle as much .is
possible." Dunning s.iid. "Setting
in the middle goes along with
passing. It's giving iis .1 lot of hal

ant e in our oflense."
Mc( iee put up six of those kills in
the opening game, as the Cardinal
cruised to an easy 'M)-21 win.
Nine senice errors In Stanford
let the Cougars stay competitive in
the second, but 12 hitting errors
and.i .047 hitting percentage
stopped WSI in its trat ks in the HO

I he Stanford attack took over
from there, rat king up 21 kills with
only two errors in the final game.
I lie ('.ardinal brought the matt li to
an end in less than ( .H) minutes with
a 30-23 win.
"One of the key things we
wanted to do was come out
strong," McC.ee said. "We've
started slowh over the last couple
of weeks, so it was good to see us
get on them early."
