# City of Berkeley calls for end to bombing
## Amidst controversy, City Council votes to denounce bombing 
### KELLY GRIEGO 
Alter mm h heated debate,
last Wednesday Berkeley be
came the first American city to
issue a formal declaration call
ing for tlie rapid cessation of
the bombings in Afghanistan.
I lie measure's sponsor,
Counc ilwoman Dona Spring,
has been at the center ola
swirling controversy since the
proposal's inception.
Within the council, debate
surrounded the first draft of the
measure, in which Spring ex
pressed sympathy toward inno
cent Afghani victims of the
airstrikes, yet not for the victims
of the Sept. 1 I attacks. I his
draft fell short of the six votes
needed for immediate debate
and harsh criticism followed for
what many deemed as a huge
oversight. With an added clause
to honor the Americans whose
lives were lost, the measure
gained support.
The second draft of the five
part measure was passed by a 5-
4 vote, split along party lines,
with the leftists supporting the
vote and the centrists abstaining.
Recognizing that Berkeley
has a tradition of taking strong
stands on large issues, Spring
told the San Francisco Chroni
cle, "If [the Berkeley City ( oun

cil| can't support .1 nonviolent
resolution, when or where will
some government agent \ do
that?"
1 he citv's lire ollk i.tls tein
porarilv ordered the removal
of American Hags from lire
(rut ks 111 the davs following the
Sept. 1 I attacks. and I ( -
Berkeley students have led the
nation's campuses in holding
regular and large-scale anti
war rallies since the attack.
Mam students engaged 111 the
active debate surrounding the
measure.
()n Sept. 25. the con 111 il unani
moush voted to commend Rep.
Barbara fee. whose district in
cludes the city ol Berkeley, for
being the sole opposing vote
against the Congressional resolu
tion calling for widened military
authority for President Bush.
Yet thecitN has been largely
divided over Spring's measure,
flie Oct. 17 decision was made
before several I V cameras and
a council chamber completely
tilled with constituents, whose
division was apparent through
the waving of American Hags,
countered by the clutching of
"Stop the War'' signs.
While the measure did con
demn the terrorist attacks on
America, it did not condemn the
I .S. bombings in Afghanistan,
which early rumors incorrectly
stated. It did. however, ask to
bring "the bombing to a conclu
sion as soon as possible." Spring
