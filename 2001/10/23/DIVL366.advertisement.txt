P.J. O'Rourke lias toured the fighting in Bosnia, visited
the West Bank disguised as P.J. of Arabia, lobbed one-liners
on the battlefields of the Gulf War, and traded quips with
Communist rebels in the jungles of the Philippines. Now,
in the CEO of the Sofii, he embarks on a mission to the
most frightening place of all his own home. Ensconced
on the domestic boardroom's throne(although not
supposed to put his feet on its cushions), he faces a
three-year old who wants a cell phone and a free-lance
career devoted to writing articles like "Chewing-Mouth
Dogs Bring Hope to People with Eating Disorders". Now
in a debut appearance, he will brave the Stanford Bookstore
to deliver the comcdic wisdom of his personal adventures
' in and out of the home. Don't miss this rare
opportunity to hear one of America's funniest authors!
STANFORD!
