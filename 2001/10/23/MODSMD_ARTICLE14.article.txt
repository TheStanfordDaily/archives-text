"()ne of the big problems is who is or

l.asl ye-ai. (lalifornia's student-aid
program was landed b\ lawmakei s as
the most generous in the nation.
I his year, the pat kage has failed to
reach thousands of needy and eligi
ble students.
()nly two-thirds of the Cal (irants in

fall were actualh awarded, according to
the Chronicle of Higher Lducation.
Cailf. Cov. (ira\ Davis set aside funds
for 72,508 awards to ret cut high-si hool
graduates foi this academie year, hut
only 48,3f>8 were distributed.
Over 40,000 students never received
a grant because of limits placed on the
program b\ the California legislature,
even though they applied and qualified
for one.
"This year, I noticed a decrease in m\
universit) general scholarship," said se
nior Kb.mli Lai. "(There was] a definite
dec lease in si holarship amount and in

got the Cal (irant his freshman year and
then it was suddenh cut off."
Lawmakers last year promised to
spend .m additional $1.2-billion on the
C.al Cirant awards by 2005, which would
eventually increase the budget to an ap
proximate $1.7 billion per year, the
Chronic le reported. I his was supposed

I o c]iialif\ fora Cal Cirant, students
need to submit a l-ree Application for
Federal Student Aid and a form incli
(.lting their grade- average. ()l the
188,000 federal-aid applications sub
mitted this year, only 104,000 had
matching grade forms.
"()ne of the big problems is who is or
is not submitting the forms," Hartley
said. "Some schools send in that infor
mation, some schools don't.
Lven students who submitted both
forms, however, came across difficul
ties. Nearly 20,000 applications had in
(orrec t oi missing information, and an
other 34,500 didn't qualify for the
gi ants because their family income was
too high.
College officials claim that many of
their students missed the opportunity to
receive a Cal (irant because of a faulty
application prexess.
She- said that the state is looking into
possible ways of reforming the process.
" I lic-y are asking colleges and univer
sities to give them feedback about what
happened this year," she said.
Hartley said Allison Jones, assistant
vie echancelloi for academic affairs at the
California State- I nivei sit\ System, sug
gested that colleges run the process
themselves.
lew students at Stanford were affect

eel by the problem, because of their gen

minders from the I niversity s financial
aid office to get the forms in on time, ac
cording to I fart lev.
"We (oath the applic ants a lot about
meeting the deadline with both of those
things." she said. "We send them post
cards, we send them e-mails."
"It's a relatively simple process," l.ai
said. "I think it's a realh good system.
Well organized, ver\ skilled people. I
think they just need to deal with basic

forms in on time."
I lie law that expanded the ( al (Irani

While state officials had too few applic .tuts
for the guaranteed grants, they had too

awarded on a competitive basis.
