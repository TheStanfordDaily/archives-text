# THE 						CRAZY OPTIMIST

111. id .1 thought recenth ili.it Ive
been distilling for siiiiu' time:
Now that the world is changing
f'astei than ever, it is mote uselul
than evei to embrace 11 c\il>ilit\ .is oui
worldview. And I'm not siiic whethei
Stanford is encouraging this oi hold in 14
us l>.|( k

I lie earth's population has doubled
111 the p.lst .")() years. Ihe human econ
om\ ol goods and services li.is in
creased almost seven-fold. \nd one-

gone ext iuct.
I lie pace ol < liange
is iii( i easing, cspe( iall\

now have last food,

oui grandparent s w ere oui age, I \ did
not exist, male and female college sin
denls were separated l>\ dorm. I»l.i<
and whites were separated l>\ colleges,
clothes were less colorful and words,
music did not pervade the air, air
planes did not lill the sk\. traffic was
not reall\ an issue, computers were
abacuses and the Internet was hardl\
imagined bv s» ience li< tion writers.
In the fa< e ol silt li (liange, we are re
alizing that the adaptive response is not
to (ling to old ideas. I he life experience
of old people often seems irrelevant to
us, something we emphasis b\ oui wor
ship ol vouth and storage of elders.
business leaders, too, are acknowl
edging the importance of (juick adapta
tion. (ioldinan Sachs' new slogan is
"Minds Wide Open." Apple's is " I hink
Different. Bill (iates wrote a hook
called "Business at the Speed of
I bought." Business magazines now lisi
"intuition" .is ,i kev trait of good ( 1( )s.
because I he market plat t- is < hanging so
fast that they must operate "by in
siinc t. I he business mantra is "the
only ( onstant is change."
Is Stanford responding well to the
era of "Question Kverything?"
We learn how inut h has changed
since the time we were hunters and gath
erers. We learn how different human
cultures can he. Numerous professors
would say that the\ en< outage question
ing. And those who study the scientific
method understand that enduring mi
c ertainty (open-tnindedness) is a key ele
ment in the evolution of knowledge.
Willingness to question has long
been a trait ol successful leaders, be
cause bv separating themselves from
dogma, they see possibilities. We know
this. We are taught this.
We know that (icnghis Khan con
quered much of the world because he
saw new ways of organizing an army

anil using 1101 si s. We know tli.it ( oper
nicus revolutionized out conception ol
the univeise because he was willing to
re< onsidei Ptolemaic dogma. \nd we
know that llcm\ lord succeeded bill
lianth betause lie saw the possibilit\ ol
using an asseinhh line 111 Ins pi.nits We
learn about "t Inn king outside the box
We are even taught that institutions
like St an 101 (I have ( 011 lit ei produi 11\ e
l\ resisted change. I ui\eisities and
dim ( lies did not respond \\ t• 11 to I Dar
win's observations about evolution, to
the < alls o! \merii an aholitiouists 01 to
the emergent e ol c liaos 1 heoi \.
But. si ill. Stauloi (I is ,i big and 1 e

jet tives mean "slow to change \hnost
without doubt, we will learn the icle<>l<>-
g\ ol 0111 sc»c let\ here, and we will proh
abl\ think that iiiikli ol it is not worth
tjuestioning. \lni(»st without doubt, b\
going to snt h .1 c mix cut ioiial univeisi
t\, we will limit out imaginations.
I've been surprised to find such a
large number ol students who are
aware ol the huge s<>c i. 11 revolutions of
the past and vast dille rences in c ult lira I
ideologies but still eon line themselves
to lairlv mainstream lives.
I've been surprised to linel, in mvsell
and others, such an unwillingness to
question win we're attending Stanford
at all Will in\ life be more sat isl \ ing if I
go here? II so. win aren't our profes
sors more jc>\ 1111?- Are the billions ol
people who have no ac c ess to a college
education condemned to less satisfying
lives? II I want to learn engineering,
win not just pa\ a professional engi
neer tor an apprentit csliip?
\l\ point isn't realh that we shouldn't
be "mainstream," or that Stanford is a
waste. I just think that those w ho are se
rious about questioning e\er\thing end
up living more suet essful li\ es. Psychol
ogists talk about the "self-at Utilization'
that tomes from being a self-defined,
often non-conventional, person.
And here is m\ real point: because
we are on the verge of a "turning
point," or "tipping point," or "revolu
tion." we live in a world of possibilities.
Whether we call it a transition from
the ('.eno/oit tothe I'echnozoic Era, or
,111 biological Revolution like the 111-
tlusti ial Revolution, or a shift into the
Information Age, we know we're see
ing big changes. And we have the
(haute to influence the direction of
these changes if we are able to visualize
new possibilities.
As ( hange becomes more rapid, so
should our questioning become deeper.
