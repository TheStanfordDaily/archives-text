Challenging Bhutto's assertions
1 his refers to the ulk In Bena/ir Bhut
to on I Imrsday, and the campaign led by
concerned Pakistani Stanford students to
try to present some of the unsavory facts
about the former Prime Minister. As one
of the coordinators of the campaign, I have
heard a lot of positive fcedbac k ahout our
eflbrts and really appreciate the people
who saw the educational value of our pre
senting the other side of the coin to an au
dience largeh unaware of the intricacies of
Pakistani politic s.
On the other hand, there has also
been some criticism about how putting
our guest speaker on the spot is not the
way Stanford should treat guests, and
that the questions put forth to her were
too accusatory in nature and irrelevant
to the talk.
As .1 Pakistani woman, and as a Stanford
alumnus, I would like toe larif\ the reason
ing behind our actions. Ms. Bhutto is wide
ly perceived to be the Western-educated
liberated Muslim woman who despite all
odds was elected .is the Prime Minister of
an Islamic nation, not once but twice: a fact
that is truly remarkable considering the
I S. itself has yet to elect .1 President who is
a woman.
What a lot of people fail to understand
is that a major reason behind her ability to
win elections is the feudal system in Pak
istan. where the majority of the population
is an electoral slave to the feudal lords of
the land it farms on. Ms Bhutto IxMongs to
one of the most prominent and powerful
feudal families in Pakistan, which means
that the serfs belonging to her family and
friends can be made to vote for her.
I he truly disturbing fact is not how
she came into power but what Ms Bhutto
chose to do with that power, despite her
years at Harvard and Oxford getting an
education most people in Pakistan can
not even dream of.
According to the New York I iines. i he-
Bhutto lamiK's wealth itu leased b\ $100
million during Ms Bhutto's second stint ,ts
Prime Minister, and hei husband has
been convicted ol taking kickbacks <>n

A simple I ntei net sea i th v ields iiu i ini
inating evidence and substantial foreign
i barges ag.iinsi the couple, main of'whic h
her husband li.is been t onvii ted of and is
serving sentences for. Ms Bhutto herself
has been sentenced to three vears in
prison for failing to show up in Pakistan to
face the corruption ( barges against her.
Innocent until proven guiltv, \es. I
would still like any past, present 01 future
Prime Minister ol mine to have the in
legritx to lace up to an\ i barges brought
up against them. I bis is the reason wh\ I.

Former Prof, urges America to maintain
proper focus
I lie < micni "war" was launched by a
lieue attack on America that has united
ilie <ountr\ behind it and brought it to a
level ol almost unanimous expressions ol
seri<>iisiirss. w hit 11 contrast strikinglv with

tlif "trivial" concerns and frivolity <>la lew
short weeks ago and the Cllintonian
decade preceding.
I'he President lias laid out out objec
tives with broadly-praised clarity and re
solve, and there is general agreement
about the need to go decisively alter the
scattered terrorist network, but with pa
tience, humane targeting and the cooper
ation ol all "civilized nations," including
Islamic ones.
I here remains some uncertainty about
the best procedure: the debate between
the State Department (Powell) and De
fense (Rumsfeld, \ Vol low it /) is one aspec I
ol this hesitation: should we give primacv
to coalition-building, whit h, as in the war
against Serbia, made decision-making dif
ficult, or a more-focused approach, fea
turing relatively clean-cut, independent
policy and action by the I niled States and
a few close allies (especially the I nited
Kingdom).
It is possible to combine 'these atti
tudes, as Senator Fred Thompson (R -
I N) believes, through a judicious com
promise, but line tuning of the balance is
called lor. And lor that we need to under
stand what sort ol balance it is.
In a word, it is multidimensional.
I he Powell line implies the relatively
horizontal, across-the-board dimension
ol the civic and diplomatic : "all civilized
nations," and a consonant soft pedaling ol
our seminal Western values, which have
always motivated the finest el.in and s.u ri
fle es of our soldiers.
Those ideas are the complementary,
and more basic , dimension of organized
lile: not civic, statist, 01 civili/ational. but
deeply < ultural.

Like all profound reality - love, nuc lear
lore e - it is problematic and c an be danger
ous, as history show s. But what is life without
it? Our recent history shows the even
greater danger in spiritual shallowness.
II we forsake that motivating psyche
depth in favor of tactical, and tactful, con
siderations, we will likely not litre well
against a fanatically faith-driven enemy in
the field. And our politico-military leader
ship will be similarly emasculated.
It is difficult, but possible to be both clc
i ent (i ivili/ed) and c ultured (faith-based) .is
our Founders and Abraham Lincoln
demonstrated.
And so, even as we reach out lor support
in the Moslem world, let us not forget the
tragic lads of history.
It would be lolly to ignore that the gov
ernments we deal with and make common
limited cause with, ac ross the geographical
IxKtrcl, are by definition more statist, upper
class, educated, civilized, internationalist,
than the millions of men and women in the
masses c alling for our blood.
But these are the kind of people we have
to light. And. roughly speaking, these are
the kind ol people, sue li as the tough Ivans
ol World War 11, welbughl alongside ol and
often were, we veterans remember.

Challenging Bhutto's assertions

concerned Pakistani Stanford students to
try to present some of the unsavory facts
about the former Prime Minister. As one
of the coordinators of the campaign, I have
heard a lot of positive fcedbac k ahout our
eflbrts and really appreciate the people
who saw the educational value of our pre
senting the other side of the coin to an au
dience largeh unaware of the intricacies of
Pakistani politic s.
On the other hand, there has also
been some criticism about how putting
our guest speaker on the spot is not the
way Stanford should treat guests, and
that the questions put forth to her were
too accusatory in nature and irrelevant
to the talk.
As .1 Pakistani woman, and as a Stanford
alumnus, I would like toe larif\ the reason

ly perceived to be the Western-educated
liberated Muslim woman who despite all
odds was elected .is the Prime Minister of
an Islamic nation, not once but twice: a fact
that is truly remarkable considering the
I S. itself has yet to elect .1 President who is
a woman.
What a lot of people fail to understand
is that a major reason behind her ability to
win elections is the feudal system in Pak
istan. where the majority of the population
is an electoral slave to the feudal lords of
the land it farms on. Ms Bhutto IxMongs to
one of the most prominent and powerful
feudal families in Pakistan, which means
that the serfs belonging to her family and
friends can be made to vote for her.
I he truly disturbing fact is not how
she came into power but what Ms Bhutto
chose to do with that power, despite her
years at Harvard and Oxford getting an
education most people in Pakistan can
not even dream of.

Former Prof, urges America to maintain
proper focus
I lie < micni "war" was launched by a
lieue attack on America that has united
ilie <ountr\ behind it and brought it to a
level ol almost unanimous expressions ol
seri<>iisiirss. w hit 11 contrast strikinglv with

tlif "trivial" concerns and frivolity <>la lew
short weeks ago and the Cllintonian
decade preceding.
I'he President lias laid out out objec
tives with broadly-praised clarity and re
solve, and there is general agreement
about the need to go decisively alter the
scattered terrorist network, but with pa
tience, humane targeting and the cooper
ation ol all "civilized nations," including
Islamic ones.
I here remains some uncertainty about
the best procedure: the debate between
the State Department (Powell) and De
fense (Rumsfeld, \ Vol low it /) is one aspec I
ol this hesitation: should we give primacv
to coalition-building, whit h, as in the war
against Serbia, made decision-making dif
ficult, or a more-focused approach, fea
turing relatively clean-cut, independent
policy and action by the I niled States and
a few close allies (especially the I nited
Kingdom).
It is possible to combine 'these atti
tudes, as Senator Fred Thompson (R -
I N) believes, through a judicious com
promise, but line tuning of the balance is
called lor. And lor that we need to under
stand what sort ol balance it is.
In a word, it is multidimensional.
I he Powell line implies the relatively
horizontal, across-the-board dimension
ol the civic and diplomatic : "all civilized
nations," and a consonant soft pedaling ol
our seminal Western values, which have
always motivated the finest el.in and s.u ri
fle es of our soldiers.
Those ideas are the complementary,
and more basic , dimension of organized
lile: not civic, statist, 01 civili/ational. but
deeply < ultural.

Like all profound reality - love, nuc lear
lore e - it is problematic and c an be danger
ous, as history show s. But what is life without
it? Our recent history shows the even
greater danger in spiritual shallowness.
II we forsake that motivating psyche
depth in favor of tactical, and tactful, con
siderations, we will likely not litre well
against a fanatically faith-driven enemy in
the field. And our politico-military leader
ship will be similarly emasculated.
It is difficult, but possible to be both clc
i ent (i ivili/ed) and c ultured (faith-based) .is
our Founders and Abraham Lincoln
demonstrated.
And so, even as we reach out lor support
in the Moslem world, let us not forget the
tragic lads of history.
It would be lolly to ignore that the gov
ernments we deal with and make common
limited cause with, ac ross the geographical
IxKtrcl, are by definition more statist, upper
class, educated, civilized, internationalist,
than the millions of men and women in the
masses c alling for our blood.
But these are the kind of people we have
to light. And. roughly speaking, these are
the kind ol people, sue li as the tough Ivans
ol World War 11, welbughl alongside ol and
often were, we veterans remember.
