Alum defends Rob Gaudet's writings
I >itl anv one othei than in\ sell send a let -

regarding the t oinplcxitiesol Islam and the
erroi in the blanket thai at terization ol
Islam as "peaceful?" I have seen nothing
but attacks. One reader tocla\ character
iz.eel (iaudet's piece as "exuding omnipo

(iaudct elot|iientl\ defended himsell
vesterda\ against the writer of a lettei that
appeared in Ft itla\ s edition. (iaudet's ob
jee tion was to the glib and uniform charat -
terization of Islam as "peaceful." lie toi
let tl\ identified Islam as "toinplcx" in this
regard; Islam, and )udaism and ('.liristian
it\ have scriptural justification lor \ iolence
loi those who ( are to find it.
Historically, practitioners of all these
faiths have at times identified with the \ io
letit as pet t that advot ated genocides of the
infidels. bin Laden is not misquoting the
Koran, an\ more that Falwell and Robert
son are misrepresenting the bible when
the) itnpK that the Sept. 1 I events were
due to America turning awav from (iod.
Fundamentalism entails, among other
things, the view that the fundamentalist's
scripture, whatever that may be. is the
complete and inerrant word of (iod.
From this viewpoint, religious justifica
tion of violence is logically inevitable, fo
state these facts is to invite the vitriol to
which Ciaudet has been subjected, if in
deed the viewpoint is even allowed to see
the light of day.

Daily editorial too harsh on Berkeley
Make no mistake about it. Stanford's
problem, or .it Ic.im the Daily's problem, is
not apathy, but shrewd ( omplaceney. (ilib
support of all authority, the bigger the bet
ter. Or so claimed a friend of mine over

dinnct .ilcu nights back. Although, at the
time, I argued against this diagnosis. Fri
day's Dail\ editorial only seems to c onfirm
the observation.
I he editorial excoriates the Berkeley
( it \ ( • in in il lor speaking out against uni
lateial exec utivc dec isions to continue the
hotnhings of \fghanislan.
Perhaps tlie editorial hopes to teach a
not-so-suhtle lesson in civil obedience to
the mam and iiu teasing numbers ol Stan
lord students who like to think for them
selves. who mull things over, rather than
have their ideals and opinions spoonfed.
I lie editors mock the Berkeley Coun
(il's "lofi\ moralistic pert h" and < harac ter
i/e them as "simplistic " and out-of-touc h,
because, unlike the federal government,
the\ do not spend sleepless nights wor
rying how "their decisions will affect
the lives of millions and perhaps the
future of the free world." not to men
tion — gasp — the media.
News Flash: many of us outside of gov
ernment c ire les (jo"wake up each morning
and go to sleep each night" worried about
the war. its consequences lot the world and
w hat out individual dec isions mean to mil
lions of people. I his is especially significant
because, with their torturous insomnia and
media abuse, elected officials are merely
performing their sworn jobs, what they get
paid to do.
Instead, I give my highest respect to the
multitudes of Stanford students, be they
objectivists or peace activists, who toil away,
unpaid and underappreciated, trying to
mold public opinion and impact govern
ment policy. Responding peacefully and
constructively to deep moral or philosoph
ical convictions is rarely the easiest or most
expedient course of action. But decisions
like that of the Berkeley Council reflect
courage, dedication and American values
of free speech, which should be praised
rather than condemned.

Challenging Bhutto's assertions
1 his refers to the ulk In Bena/ir Bhut
to on I Imrsday, and the campaign led by
concerned Pakistani Stanford students to
try to present some of the unsavory facts
about the former Prime Minister. As one
of the coordinators of the campaign, I have
heard a lot of positive fcedbac k ahout our
eflbrts and really appreciate the people
who saw the educational value of our pre
senting the other side of the coin to an au
dience largeh unaware of the intricacies of
Pakistani politic s.
On the other hand, there has also
been some criticism about how putting
our guest speaker on the spot is not the
way Stanford should treat guests, and
that the questions put forth to her were
too accusatory in nature and irrelevant
to the talk.
As .1 Pakistani woman, and as a Stanford
alumnus, I would like toe larif\ the reason
ing behind our actions. Ms. Bhutto is wide
ly perceived to be the Western-educated
liberated Muslim woman who despite all
odds was elected .is the Prime Minister of
an Islamic nation, not once but twice: a fact
that is truly remarkable considering the
I S. itself has yet to elect .1 President who is
a woman.
What a lot of people fail to understand
is that a major reason behind her ability to
win elections is the feudal system in Pak
istan. where the majority of the population
is an electoral slave to the feudal lords of
the land it farms on. Ms Bhutto IxMongs to
one of the most prominent and powerful
feudal families in Pakistan, which means
that the serfs belonging to her family and
friends can be made to vote for her.
I he truly disturbing fact is not how
she came into power but what Ms Bhutto
chose to do with that power, despite her
years at Harvard and Oxford getting an
education most people in Pakistan can
