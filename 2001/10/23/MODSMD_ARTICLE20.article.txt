()n Saturday, St. Louis found themselves over
matched from the verv beginning, as Stanford
ra< ked up an astounding 25 shots on goal, 15 in the
liist hall alone. St. Louis managed only seven shots
on goal all game long.
"It's always nice when it works out statistically,"
head (oat li Sheryl Johnson said.
In the game's opening minutes, Stanford had
three near-goals, as St. Louis was pushed back on its
heels. However, Billikens goalie Krin Linchan

stymied the Cardinal <despite near-constant
pressure, making eight first-half saves.
It seemed to be not a question of if but rather
when the Cardinal would score, lime and time
again, good chances failed due to luck and last-sec
ond plays by St. Louis. Melees in the striking circle
with 25 and 15 minutes left in the half, while excit
ing, produced no goals, and penalty corners with
23:40 and 14:30 rem.lining in the half proved fruit
less as well.
However, for all their defensive mettle, St. Louis
was unable to penetrate the staunch Stanford de
fense. I'hev spent most of the half struggling to bold
off the Cardinal and were unable to put together
anything other than .t few long runs on offense.
However, aftei being pressured all half by Stan
ford's superioi ball-handling skills and crisp passing
game, St. l.ouis finalb faltered with 2:00 left before
the half. Freshman forward F.leanor Morgan drib
bled the ball into the i ight of the (in le and passed it
to Swese\ on hei left, w hose shot was deflected and
sailed high ovei 1 ,iiu ban into the top of the back net.
I he goal was ,i virtual reenactment of a goal in
Stanford's ()ct. I I win over l\u ific. in which Morgan
and Swese\ also siu i essfullv exet uted the same play
to perfection.
"1 just get set u| > a lot," Swesey said. "It's a lot of
teamwork, and in the end it works out."
Due to Swese\'s goal, the (Cardinal went into hall
time with a 1-0 lead, though it seemed like it could
have been much larger.
However, the Hillikens were not done fighting
just vet. 1 wo minutes into the second half, St. Louis
forward kei i Hrunner di ibbled around the left side
of the c irt le and found herself with a clear shot on
goal. Shapiro, who had not allowed a goal in a month
