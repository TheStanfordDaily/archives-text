ward and captain Krica Swesey scored the game's
lone goal off a rebound with 21 minutes and 51 sec -
onds i emaining in the first half, for her sixth goal in
lout games. Senior goalkeeper Rebecca Shapiro
made the lead stand up, recording her fourth

on goal all game long.
"It's always nice when it works out statistically,"
head (oat li Sheryl Johnson said.
In the game's opening minutes, Stanford had
three near-goals, as St. Louis was pushed back on its
heels. However, Billikens goalie Krin Linchan

stymied the Cardinal <despite near-constant
pressure, making eight first-half saves.
It seemed to be not a question of if but rather
when the Cardinal would score, lime and time
again, good chances failed due to luck and last-sec
ond plays by St. Louis. Melees in the striking circle
with 25 and 15 minutes left in the half, while excit
ing, produced no goals, and penalty corners with
23:40 and 14:30 rem.lining in the half proved fruit
less as well.
However, for all their defensive mettle, St. Louis
was unable to penetrate the staunch Stanford de
fense. I'hev spent most of the half struggling to bold
off the Cardinal and were unable to put together
anything other than .t few long runs on offense.
However, aftei being pressured all half by Stan

game, St. l.ouis finalb faltered with 2:00 left before
