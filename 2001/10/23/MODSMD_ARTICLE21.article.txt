"After the game it's realk fun whethet it's

your fans," added senior defender
Amy Saner, "l-.specially with .1 win.
It's nice to celebrate. It's so nice to
have people stick around and get
autographs. We really appreciate
their support."
Stanford's commitment to their
ever-growing fan base was made most
evident after the loss to Santa C .lara.
Even after a dramatic sudden
death overtime finale — a quick 30-
yard blast on a fieekick handed the
Cardinal it's first loss of the season and
it's first loss at home since 1999 — the
team remained committed to its audi
ence. Regardless of the loss, many of
the women stopped for autographs
and smiled for pictures.
In spite of the commitment dis
played by the women and the pas
sion with which they play, society
continues hesitating to take women's

sports seriously.
Constant comparisons to the men
haunt female athletes, never allowing
them to redefine their respective spoil
for themselves.
"It's frustrating because you know
maybe our game isn't as fast paced or
as phvsical," Saner said. "But I think
that if you were to look at it objec
tively there's a relative level of skill
and the way the game is played I
think it's just as equal and just as re
spectable in that sense.
"Its frustrating to hear comments
like 'underwater s<xcer' but you just
have to take it in stride and have fun
with it, you have to know who you are
«ind enjoy what you're doing, you
can't really let those negative com
ments get to you."
I lie Cardinal rarely displays signs
of psychological fatigue. The team
continues to practice hard, with a
mindset focused 011 skill improvement
rather than proving to cynical critics
that its athleticism and knowledge of
the game warrant approval.
"It would Ik- great to come back in

four \ c.irs and have Stanford women's
soccer as one of the main athletic at
tractions," Sauer said. "Whether or
not that's realistic, you have to take
steps to build that foundation. 1 think
the little things we do during the year
like going out to elementary schools
and volunteering keeps little kids and
their families coming back."
With their focus on the field com
bined with volunteering in the com
munit\ comes an overriding sense of
responsibility to their sport and to
their gender. Whether or not the Car
dinal knows it. they are paving the way
for women soccer players in the future
by expanding traditional notions of fe
male athleticism.
While the continued growth of
women's athletics, and likewise Stan
ford women's soccer, appears likely,
the question becomes whether the
Stanford student body will ever recog
