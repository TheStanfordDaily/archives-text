Last Saturday night, a sellout crowd of
2,717 at Stanford's own I aube famil) [fu
nis Stadium watched twoof the most revered
American athletes rekindle their old com
petitive fire in a very entertaining match.
In a match that saw improbable shots,
coupled with 49-year old Jimmy Connors
showing blatant but comical signs of fa

It was obvious that Connors was
