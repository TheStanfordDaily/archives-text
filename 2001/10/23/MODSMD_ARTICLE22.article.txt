### JIMMY WU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Saturday night, a sellout crowd of
2,717 at Stanford's own I aube famil) [fu
nis Stadium watched twoof the most revered
American athletes rekindle their old com
petitive fire in a very entertaining match.
In a match that saw improbable shots,
coupled with 49-year old Jimmy Connors
showing blatant but comical signs of fa
tigue, former No. 1 player John McEnroe
ousted Connors, (i-3, 6-4.
I he match between McEnroe, a winner
of seven Crand Slams and rival Connors,
who won eight in his illustrious career, was
the main attraction at last weekend s Siebel
( .hampions Tournament.
McEnroe and Connors joined a field of
14 former Association of I cnnis Players
tennis stars at the event.
The tournament was one of more than
20 events that will be held as part of the
Champions Tour, which composes of
players who have reached the age of 35

and are no longer active on the A I P
tour.
I his was the first time in two years that
the old nemeses have played each other on
the ('.hampions I our.
"It was special tonight." McEnroe com
mented about the atmosphere. "You could
feel it in the crowd. I was ready for any
thing. I wanted to welcome [Connors] back
to the tour and give him a workout."
Connors, who co-founded the l our in
1903, emphasized the importance of keep
ing the tennis fans happy and also of main
taining a high level of play.
"It's a continuation of what we've been
doing fora long time [with the ('.hampions
Tour]," he said. "Playing good tennis,
bringing out the fans. I hope [McEnroe]
enjoys it as much as I do."
At times, the match between tlu* two for
mer stars was very circus-like, but it cer
tainly was not without remarkable points
that had the audience gasping for air.
It was obvious that Connors was
nowhere near the conditioning of a sur
prisingly fit McEnroe, but he made the
most of it.
After many of the long rally points, ( on
nors would unabashedly take his time, con-
wising with the audience inem-
Ihts or even .i! one point, shout
ing to the ( rowd, "Somedav, von
will turn 49!"
Of course. Ins fans could not
resist, and replied. "You look
great. |imm\!" and "We love von.
Jimmy!"
