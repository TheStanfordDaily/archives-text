I'lie ( ardinal started off its successful
road trip with a Saturday league game
against the I9ers, coached by Rick
\/evedo— the father of Stanford's
leading s( orei. redshirt freshman I'ony
\/evedo. Rick's knowledge ol his son's
pla\. however, proved insufficient to
contain the skill and determination of
I <>n\ and his teammates.

|nnioi Brian Harrow opened up the
score lot Stanford with an outside shot,
followed by an extra-man goal l>\ junior
Ail-American hole man Peter Hudnut.
Junioi JelfNesmith notched a counter
attack goal to round out the Cardinal's
3-0 lead at the close of the first quarter.
In the second period, Harrow sent
another shot into the opponent's net to
increase the gap to 4-0. I he 49ers came
back with three goals, but their hopes ol
cati lung up were demolished In .moth
er three goals from Stanford, propelling
it to a 7-3 lead at halftime.
By the end of the match, the Cardinal
had increased the goal gap to 11-0.
Azevedo and Harrow led the scoring
spree with three goals apiece. Iludnut
and Nesmith had two each and junior
JeffCuyman contributed one as well.
Stanford's front-core offense was
particularly effective — the Cardinal
had nine natural goals out of its total ol
1 I in comparison to Long Beach State's
one of six.
"They stopped Tony on the (i-on-5
by pressing him, but he made up for it
by getting three natural goals on the
outside shot," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti.
Stanford's successful offense was
complemented by strong defense,
which was able to bar the 49ers from
the goal most of the time. Junior All-
American goalkeeper Nick Kllis had
eight saves to supplement the team's
solid defense.

"We sun k loom game plan and exe
cuted it prett\ well, dominating the
game from the ver\ beginning,Hud
nut said. "It was a good game to watch as
far as team defense and team pla\ goes."
In another league game on Sunday,
the (Cardinal was unexpectedly placed
under pressure bv Id-Santa Barbara.
(Challenged l»\ the unusual factor of
plaving in a pool with one shallow end.
Stanford was oil to a slow start, with a
narrow 2-1 lead after the first period on
goals b\ Nesmith and Harrow.
"It's difficult fora six-foot-five per
son. as a few of us are. to play water polo
in ,i five-foot deep pool." I ludnut said.
At halftiine, the goal difference re
mained unc hanged at 4-It, with the C Car

another goal foi his team, but the (>au
c hos once again matched it soon after
wards to continue breathing down Stan
ford's neck at 5-4.
Once it became used to the pool's
shallow end. however, the (Cardinal
squad was able to swing the scales dec i
sively in its favor with a four-goal scor
ing run. Stanford's defense plaved a
c i ucial part as it contributed three of the
four goals bv stealing the ball from the
(>auc hos and executing successful coun
terattacks.

game showed how well we could
pla\ \*hen we Ibcused all our en

the opposite — we weren't too lo
