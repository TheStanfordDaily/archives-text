## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM 
Last week, the Provost's
Committee on lenvironmental
S( iencc, Engineci ingand I'olii \
announced a new initiative
aimed at unifying the broad
range ol environment-related
work at Stanford, .in ohjeetivc
first cited dining Contlolccz/a
Kite's tenure as Provost.
I he first of two main features
of the initiative is the creation of
a new interdisciplinar\ I'll.I),
program, the lnterdisci|)linar\
Graduate Program in Environ
ment and Resources, whit li will
fuse st ientific stuth of the earth
with economics, law and other
disciplines. Ihe second is the
launching of a new "portal"
Web site.
Robert Dunbar, .issot iate
chair of'the Department oft Geo
logical and Environmental Sci
ences, is expected to be the first
director of I PER. He credited
leaders of the Earth Systems
Program with first envisioning
an interdisciplinary study of the
environment in the mid-19905.
The Earth Systems Program
then offered a bachelor's degree
and the option of a cotcrminal
degree, but did not have a tlot -
toral program.
Biology Prof. Peter Vi
tousek, chair of the provost's
committee that announced the
new initiative, explained that
Stanford professors from dif
ferent disciplines had been col
laborating for years on envi
ronmental issues, just never in

a sii tit tured context.
I le saitl that the tlet ision to
exploi e strut tut ing the I ni
versit\ sin ten list ipliu.it \ slut I \
of the environment was not
simply the result of .1 single,
specific incident.
" I here were 110 big things,
just lots of little things." be said.
Ihe first major movement
toward ehange occurred when
Rice appointed forinei I nivcr
silv President Donald Kenneth
to head a committee which ex
plored the possibility of coordi
nating the Stanford's diverse
environmental research.
In February 2000, this com
mittee issued ,\ report encour
aging the I nivcrsitv to 1 reate a
program which would make
Stanford "a national leatlei in
providing solutions for environ
mental problems."
Current Provost John
Etchcmendy then treated the
committee that \ itousek head
ed to brainstorm ways to realize
the University's vision, an eflort
that produced the initiative an
nounced last week.
I he Web site is already up
and running, and the creation
of I PER will go to a vote at the
Faculty Senate meeting on
I hursday. I hose involved are
optimistic that it will be ap
proved, as University Presi
dent John Hennessy and
Etc hetnendy have endorsed
the plan.
Ibe new Ph.D program was
c rcatcd with an emphasis on being trul\ in
terdisc iplinai \.
Several othei universities, such as Duke,
the I ('.-Berkelcv and Harvard have similai
environmental programs, but what sets Stan
ford's apart is its emphasis on a holistic knowl
edge of the subject, ac cording to I)unhar.
"Most of the existing programs nation
wide would have people come in and be true
experts in one field," said 112 )unbai . "We want
expertise to be in the interdisciplinary sub
ject Its not just desired to c loss disciplines,
it's required."
According to those involved with lIT.R.
main students in law, business and othei
graduate s( hools at Stanford are interested
in integrating tlicit studies with environ
mental studies, but c intently have no wa\ of
doing so.
"The I'll.I), program is for those stu
dents who really fit entire!) in between,"
Vitousck said.
Dunbar added that Stanford lackccl a for
mal link between economic and legal envi
ronmental nuclei standifig and scientific en
viron mental understanding.
" l lie thing we seemed to be missing was
the umbrella that linked the scientists and
the engineers ac ross the traditional intellec
tual divide," he said.
Dunbar anticipates that a lew students
will transfer into the new programs from
other graduate programs next vear and has
set a maximum enrollment of 25 to 30 stu
dents. faculty involved in the program

"We have a tremendous number of peo
ple who do valuable em ironmental work at
Stanford," said Yitousek. who emphasized
the need to (leate a strut lure, like that es
tablished l>\ the new initiative, that was not
limiting. " I he problem is how do we put lo
gcthei a struct in e that works without burea
dalic i/ing the interat lions we do have."
Nonetheless. Yitousek said he antit ipates
onl\ posiii\e results. "I think that a better
and broadei environmental community at
Stanford will come from this," he said.
Ihe sitf, http://environment.Stanford
.edu, was developed l>\ Civil and Environ
inental Engineering Prof. Jeffrey Kosetl and
Lin ironmental Studies Prof. Pamela Mat
son, both members of the provost's commit
tee. I he provost 's office as well as the schools
of Lai lb S( iences, Kngineei ing and I luman
nies and Sciences and the Institute for Inter
national Studies fund the site.
"The portal gives people a view from
outside of what there is 112 rom Stanford," Yi
tousek said.
I he sile destribes the new Environmen
lal Initiative .is "a consortium of people from
the Schools of I anli Sciences. Engineering,
Humanities and Sciences, Law and Medi
cine, whose research, teaching, and out
reach are directed toward interdisciplinary
and integrative approac lies to solving prob
lems of the environment while meeting the
needs of people and the othei species with
whom we share the Planet.
