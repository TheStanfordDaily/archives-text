Last week, the Provost's
Committee on lenvironmental
S( iencc, Engineci ingand I'olii \
announced a new initiative
aimed at unifying the broad
range ol environment-related
work at Stanford, .in ohjeetivc
first cited dining Contlolccz/a
Kite's tenure as Provost.
I he first of two main features
of the initiative is the creation of
a new interdisciplinar\ I'll.I),
program, the lnterdisci|)linar\
Graduate Program in Environ
ment and Resources, whit li will
fuse st ientific stuth of the earth
with economics, law and other
disciplines. Ihe second is the
launching of a new "portal"
Web site.
Robert Dunbar, .issot iate
chair of'the Department oft Geo
logical and Environmental Sci
ences, is expected to be the first
director of I PER. He credited
leaders of the Earth Systems
Program with first envisioning
an interdisciplinary study of the
environment in the mid-19905.
The Earth Systems Program
then offered a bachelor's degree
and the option of a cotcrminal
degree, but did not have a tlot -
toral program.
Biology Prof. Peter Vi
tousek, chair of the provost's
committee that announced the
new initiative, explained that
Stanford professors from dif
ferent disciplines had been col
laborating for years on envi
ronmental issues, just never in

a sii tit tured context.

of the environment was not
simply the result of .1 single,
specific incident.
" I here were 110 big things,
just lots of little things." be said.
Ihe first major movement
toward ehange occurred when
Rice appointed forinei I nivcr
silv President Donald Kenneth
to head a committee which ex
plored the possibility of coordi
nating the Stanford's diverse
environmental research.
In February 2000, this com
mittee issued ,\ report encour
aging the I nivcrsitv to 1 reate a
program which would make
Stanford "a national leatlei in
providing solutions for environ
mental problems."
Current Provost John
Etchcmendy then treated the
committee that \ itousek head
ed to brainstorm ways to realize
the University's vision, an eflort
that produced the initiative an
nounced last week.
I he Web site is already up
and running, and the creation
of I PER will go to a vote at the
Faculty Senate meeting on
I hursday. I hose involved are
optimistic that it will be ap
proved, as University Presi
dent John Hennessy and
Etc hetnendy have endorsed
the plan.
