Blending humor, knowledge, honesty and
passion, he showed both depth and breadth in
answering questions tanging from his stance
on the term "Latin American" to his opinion
on his own work's place in literary history.
Sou/a aspired to be a movie director but
(andidly admitted that Ins attempt at directing
his fit st film, "A Selva, was sue ha disaster th.it
he decided to concentrate on w 1 iting.
However, Sou/a s.iid ibis experience
helped him realize that he knew nothing
about the Amazon region, despite being .1 na
tive Amazonian. Sou/a joked that the film was
so bad th.it Ferreira tie ('.astro, the author of
"A Selva", died of rage three d.i\s after seeing
the film.
"I couldn't goon killing people, so 1 forgot
about directing films and stiuk to being a
writer," he said.
I le returned to the Amazon for 10 years to
research and learn the Amazonian landscape
and people. Sou/a wrote and directed several
plays, and one of the first plays, "A I'aixao de
Ajuricaba," was .1 huge hit, enjoying a nine
month run during an era when a three-week
end run was the norm.
I hiring this stage work, Souza began his first
novel, "Cialvez, Imperadoi do Acre," which
was an instantaneous success in Brazil. It was
then translated for publication in Pottugal.
Amid much laughter. Souza explained that in
Portugal, Portuguese is not spoken.
"They think they do, but they do not,"
Souza said.
"Cialvez" was translated into Knglish and
published by Avon.
"Souza is one of the best selling contempo
rary authors, and is, together with Jorge
Amado, the most translated Brazilian contem
porary author, translated not only into F.nglish
but lots of other languages," Jobim said. "He is
not only a bestseller, but he has quality work."
Souza read a section of his book, "C) Fim do
Fercero Mundo", in which he suggests that

any concept of Latin America
should include Haiti, Guadalupe
and Quebec. Sou/a said that,
much like the character in his
novel, he believes that the term
Latin America is a misnomer.
In Brazil most people would
say they are not Latin American,

lie said. When Brazilians hear the
term Latin American they think ol
"a Mexican with a big hat sleeping
after lunch . . . this is a concept
created In the French," he said.
I lowever Sou/a said he does not
reject his I .atin-American heritage.
"I don't refuse to be Latin
American if you include all the de
scendants of [the Roman empire],
which includes the French, Ital
ian, Spanish and Portuguese
speaking people living in the

American continent," he said.
I)e Sa attributed some of
Sou/a's success to his "fragmen
tary" style, which includes short
chapters with short scenes and a
narrative that "sketches" scenes
without a "third person's point,"
with a mix of irony and "sell
humor."
I'assos called Sou/.a "one of the
most important writers in con
temporary Brazilian culture, a
huge representative force in the

creation of fiction in northern
Brazil."
"It is very important that we
have the possibility to hear other
voices, from other parts of Brazil
that deal with themes about differ
ent regions and historical times of
Brazil," he added.
Souza will be on campus for the
rest of October, lie s.ii<l he enjoys

Spanish and Portuguese Prof. I.ucia dc S.i
introduced Souza.dcsc i ibing him as one of the
best-known authors in Brazil since the 19705.
I lis fii si book, " I he I niperor ol the Amazon,"
became a major success, and lie became
renowned as an authoi who writes mostly
about the Amazon.
Sou/a proved to be an entertaining speaker
who engaged the audience and fellow pan
elists. Prof. |ose I uis Jobim, a visiting scholar
in the Department of (Comparative Literature

.it Stanford from I niversidade F.stadual do
Riode Janeiro,and Prof. Jose I uiz I'assosfrom
U( '.-Berkeley.
Blending humor, knowledge, honesty and
passion, he showed both depth and breadth in
answering questions tanging from his stance
on the term "Latin American" to his opinion
on his own work's place in literary history.
Sou/a aspired to be a movie director but
(andidly admitted that Ins attempt at directing
his fit st film, "A Selva, was sue ha disaster th.it
he decided to concentrate on w 1 iting.
However, Sou/a s.iid ibis experience
helped him realize that he knew nothing
about the Amazon region, despite being .1 na
tive Amazonian. Sou/a joked that the film was
so bad th.it Ferreira tie ('.astro, the author of
"A Selva", died of rage three d.i\s after seeing
the film.
"I couldn't goon killing people, so 1 forgot
about directing films and stiuk to being a
writer," he said.
I le returned to the Amazon for 10 years to
research and learn the Amazonian landscape
and people. Sou/a wrote and directed several
plays, and one of the first plays, "A I'aixao de
Ajuricaba," was .1 huge hit, enjoying a nine
month run during an era when a three-week
end run was the norm.
I hiring this stage work, Souza began his first
novel, "Cialvez, Imperadoi do Acre," which
was an instantaneous success in Brazil. It was
then translated for publication in Pottugal.
Amid much laughter. Souza explained that in
Portugal, Portuguese is not spoken.
"They think they do, but they do not,"
Souza said.
"Cialvez" was translated into Knglish and
published by Avon.
"Souza is one of the best selling contempo
rary authors, and is, together with Jorge
Amado, the most translated Brazilian contem
porary author, translated not only into F.nglish
but lots of other languages," Jobim said. "He is
not only a bestseller, but he has quality work."
Souza read a section of his book, "C) Fim do
Fercero Mundo", in which he suggests that

Famed Brazilian writer Marcio Souza, this year's author-in-residence, spoke to students last Friday.
any concept of Latin America
should include Haiti, Guadalupe
and Quebec. Sou/a said that,
much like the character in his
novel, he believes that the term
Latin America is a misnomer.
In Brazil most people would
say they are not Latin American,

lie said. When Brazilians hear the
term Latin American they think ol
"a Mexican with a big hat sleeping
after lunch . . . this is a concept
created In the French," he said.
I lowever Sou/a said he does not
reject his I .atin-American heritage.
"I don't refuse to be Latin
American if you include all the de
scendants of [the Roman empire],
which includes the French, Ital
ian, Spanish and Portuguese
speaking people living in the

American continent," he said.
I)e Sa attributed some of
Sou/a's success to his "fragmen
tary" style, which includes short
chapters with short scenes and a
narrative that "sketches" scenes
without a "third person's point,"
with a mix of irony and "sell
humor."
I'assos called Sou/.a "one of the
most important writers in con
temporary Brazilian culture, a
huge representative force in the

creation of fiction in northern
Brazil."
"It is very important that we
have the possibility to hear other
voices, from other parts of Brazil
that deal with themes about differ
ent regions and historical times of
Brazil," he added.
Souza will be on campus for the
