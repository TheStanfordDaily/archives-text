Twin Towers Destroyed
By The Ivory Tower:
How America's Universities Harbor
the Ideas that Spread Terrorism
Gary Hull, PhD.
Director of Duke University's
Values and Ethics in the Marketplace Program
Wednesday, October 24
7PM in Building 420 Room 041
In this lecture, Dr. Hull argues that terrorism's ideology of hatred for reason, for
happiness on earth, and for wealth is the very philosophy being taught in our
universities. He then explains how our university's irrational ideas created a
foreign policy that sent an open invitation to terrorists. To protect America,,
he argues, we need a foreign policy based on Ayn Rand's philosophy of reason,
self-interest, and individualism.
