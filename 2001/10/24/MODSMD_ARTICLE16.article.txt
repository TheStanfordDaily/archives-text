On Oct. 14, members of the Asian

casian student, to the chaii position, in which
\ASA grappled with complex issues ol race,
repiesentation and leadership. Mac Donald
ran unopposed foi the office last Ma\ and his
election sparked immediate controversy with

While AASA hopes end this tumultuous
chapter in its historv and regroup .is a more
cohesive unit, we urge the inout) to address

the issues that this protractcd debate have
brought to light. Spec ifically, we encourage it
to examine how the racial dynamic s that the
controvei sv elicited obscure the fundamental
problems with the organization's election
procedures, .i lesson .ill student gioups can

I he idea of aw hite student leading an
Asian-American student organization brings
up critical issues that have important societal
implications. The problematic nature of white

\i issue then, and relevant now, were con

ties to help themselves without the c harity of

to undei stand the true experience of minori
ties in \mcrica. On the other hand, as AASA
has grappled with, how (an a group justify pre
venting an individual 112 rom assuming a leader

dearly, there are no easy answers to such
questions that delve into the very nature of
i a< e lelations in America.
\nd while these debates could go on indefi
nitely, tliev fail to touch upon the main concern
which we feel is relevant to AASA: that their
ele c tion proc ess failed them. AASA consciously
elected Mac Donald, knowing he was white. It
was onlv after his election that the race-related
leadership concerns discussed above surfaced,
liv elec ting Mac Donald. AASA gave him its
vote of approval, ostensibly indicating that his

race was not a problem. True, he ran unop
posed. hut this could have been addressed by
postponing of the election and allowing time to
solicit the nomination of other candidates. II
there were truly no other students interested
in running for the chair of AASA, then the or
ganization has a \\ hole other set ol issues to ad
dress. At the very least, AASA should have ad
dressed the racial dimension of their potential
chair prior to the election. Perhaps it could
have provided an open forum to allow the
community to express its concerns.
AASA cannot not afford to linger over its
mistakes but this does not mean it should ig
nore completely the lessons of the past.
Hopefully, AASA can emerge stronger and
more united from this episode, but to do so it
must address the structural problems that
Mat Donald's election and tenure have
brought to light.
