Editorial neglected several aspects of
Greek organizations
While I lie Dail\ s Oct. 17 editorial,
"Consider oil km options Ibr (ireek hous
ing" is admirable loi itn conciliatory tone
and legitimate proposal ol compromise,
the authors l.iil to accurately portray
housed (.reek (haptcrs .it Stanford. I he
common myth tli.ii fraternities and sorori
ties .ne elitist so< i.il (lul>s is detrimental to
hoth (.reek 01 gani/ations and the campus
as a whole, and onl\ serves to complicate
the debate over housing.
I he importance ol (ireek housing for
(ampus sex ial lile is given ihore than its fair
share of publicity, while the things that
make (.reek life trul\ uni(juc are often
glossed over, lot example. I lie Dail\ men
tions (several times) the view that "fiaterni
t\ parties are often the main social option
on weekend nights" fot Stanford students,
while noting community service only in
passing, and (liarity events are not men
tioned at all. In addition, (ireek housing
provides an unrivaled opportunity to be
surrounded In some of the most interest
ing and active people .it Stanford. Libeling
(Ireek lile as "exclusive" only perpetuates
the myth of elitism; in reality, these organi
zations are molded In those w ho choose to
join them, not the other way around.
Additionally, I lie Daily's assertion,
"Stanford has not traditionally been a
(ireek campus," is a fallacy. According to
the Office of Student Activities, .since its
founding. Stanford has "served as host to
more than l. r > different fraternal organiza
tions." Seven fraternities opened their
doors in 1 S<> 1 and in I!H>9, there were 24
housed fraternities on the Stanford (am
pus, most of whit h < onstituted the present
day (Fraternity) Row. It is clear that Stan
ford is traditionally a (ireek campus, hut
my argument is not loi tradition. Rather, I

see the (ireek system as a d\ iiainii entity ca
pable of (liange as the students see fit.
As such, fear of "(ireek domination" is
unfounded and even contradictory to the
aims ol the (ireek s\stein. I he houses are
devoted to students who (hoose to commit
themselves to the service, friendship and
(amaradei it* the\ inspire.
We're lu< kv to have so main active or
ganizations at Stanford, and we should sup
port them as best we can. Fraternities have
no more right to housing than any other
group, but their nature makes them highly
residential, and certain houses are more
condiu i\e to fulfilling their needs than oth
ers. I lie I lousing Review Board should
keep this in mind w hen making its decision
on this matter.

Sanity of objectivist author questioned
Alter reading the full-page Objectivist
ad in Friday's Daily, I had to wonder about
the sanity of the writer. Leonard IVikoff
first tells us that terrorism exisis because
certain states (especially Iran, which is com
pared to Na/i Germany) support it, then
argues th.it the only way to eliminate ter
rorism is to conquer Iran and completely
replace its government. Is lie trying to start
World War III?
Ix't's think about the ramifications of his
argument fora minute. If we attack Iran.on
the grounds that its government supports
terrorism, then most of the Middle Fast will
join it in fighting against us. This would
quite possibly inspire most of the world's
Muslims to join in a holy war against Amer
ica, the (Irusaderof the2lst century. Even if
the rest of the world were to remain com
pletely neutral, which seems unlikely in the

extreme, we would have .111 enoi 111011s war
011 our bauds.
I liaven'l even mentioned IVikoH's dis
miss, il of the increasing moderation of Iran
•t> «m uttet lie or hisargumcnt that the oil in
the Middle Kast rightfully Mongs to "the
\\ est Ixrause our st ientists, engineers and
capitalists supposedly made the discovery
and use ol oil possible.
So, to sum up, the Object ivists apparent
ly think tli.it we should either kill or sup
press eveiyone who doesn't want America
to get its way .ill the time. II I were to fight
them using their own avowed tactics, I
might takea page from writer Ann Coulter's
plavlxiok and suggest converting all the Ayn
K.ind worshippers to Christianity. Islam
would he even Ijetter, but of course Islam
does not have such .t tradition of'forced con
version, and the 'objectivists inighl have
trouble with a religion that requires its
meml>ers to 111.ike charitable contributions
to the (unpnxluctive) poor.
