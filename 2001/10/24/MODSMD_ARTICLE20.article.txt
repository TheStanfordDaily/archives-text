An advertisement in last Friday s Daily
entitled " Knd States Who Sponsor Terror
ism' should have been labeled as a paid
advertisement. I lie advertisement was not
an editorial statement by I lie Daily.
An article in yesterday's Daily, "Stan
ford Savoyards cancel fall show," re
ferred to the operettas of "Gilbert Sulli
van." I he article should have referred to
"(iilbert and Sullivan."
