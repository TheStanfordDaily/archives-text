## The
						dude Answer Microsoft shifts strategy to focus on Internet 
### JEFFREY TAM STAFF WRITER 
O : 'o dude, so what's Microsoft been
doing lately to corujiier the world? I
thought they were in hig trouble when
they lost that inonopoh lawsuit, but now
I'm hearing they're coming l>a< k strong.
I keep heating these buzzwords, like
"Hailstorm," ".NLI and "Passport."
What's that .ill about?
A: Despite the federal government's
inonopoh suit against Microsoft, the
company is still doing belter lhan ever.
It's the new .NLI strategy that ma\
very well propel Microsoft into becom
ing a monopolistic player on the Inter
net. What is .XI I ? According to a Mi-

( rosoli |>.ini|»hU>i on
.Nl.l. "a revolution
is upon us." VVliat
.Nlv I aims to do is
( reale one single In
tcrnet platform
which .ill consumers
will list- — from when

iliey log on in the morning to when
they turn off their compute) at night.
Software developers will use this plat
lorm to create their applications, and
consumers would use these applica
tions. Lsseniiallv, .\f I will unify the
online experience so that users will go
from siic to site on the Internet seam
lessly using Mn rosoli tec hnolog\.
I here are a large nunibei ol compo
nents to the strategx. first, there's (I#. In
today's world, the dominant prograni
ming languages are < and (.+ +. An up
and-coming language is |ava, developed
by Sun Mic rosy stems |ava use has grown
dramatic ally ovei I he past couple < »l years
because ol its ease ol use compared to
C+ + , and the lac I thai ii adapts it self very

well to the Internet. So, Microsoft has de
veloped C#, a language thai is highly
compatible with current Internet tech
nologies like XML — a standard lor stor
ing data <>n the Internet —and improves
upon C + + .
According to \i< k Parlante. a lecturer
in computer science at Stanford and in
structor lor the class "Object Oriented
Programming in |ava," more commonly
known among students as the "Hunnv
\\ orld c lass, (\# is a good thing.
"Right now, Web software develop
ment is primitive. Par'lante said. "We're
new at solving ibis problem, so the tec h
nolog\ is relatively costly and fragile. I lie
technology to build these things is going
to gel a lot better as we leai if — .N K I is
one example of an improvement, and
there are main others."
In the big picture, Mic rosoli is look
ing lo incorporate C# into its overall
strategy, which is to gel consumers to
use Microsoft services on the Internet.
"Hailstorm" is the code word for I lie
first phase of .XL I ,and includes Pass

port, Microsoft's online authentication
service. People who use Microsoft's
Hotmail e-mail service today already
use Passport to log into their e-mail and
open Microsoft's instant messaging ser
vice. Put in the future, a consumer will
log into Passport when he or she lust
goes online, then use it as an identifica
tion card as he or she goes to different
Web sites on the Internet, customizing
the user's experience. For example,
when <i user goes to an online shopping
store, he will use Passport to identify
himself to the online store Well site and
bus products through Passport.
Surely the convenience of using one
identity to log onto all Web sites instead
ol having to keep multiple passwords for
multiple Web sites is good lor the public,
right? Put is it going to help Microsoft
dominate the Internet like; it has domi
nated the operating systems business?
Already, Microsoft is trying to incorpo
rate Passport into the newest version of
Windoyvs, Windows XP.
"1 think there's definite value to uni

fying and simplifying the notion of 'on
line identity,' " Parlante said. "It's going
to happen because it yvill help solve
problems people want solved."
"I hope that online identity ends up
being a < < (operative standard, similar to
e-mail and the Web, where the tec hnol
ogy is not controlled by one company."
I here are other companies who are
Irving lo prevent Microsoft from taking
over the Internet. Sun is pushing hard
to increase the use ol Java, even ihough
Microsoft lias spec ifically targeted Java
users to draw them towards C#. AOL
1 une Warner, a longtime Microsoft
foe, has its own equivalent of the Pass
poll authentication service, called
Magic Carpet.
So whether you're a fan of Microsoft
products or if you shudder at the
spec ter of a pervasive computing envi
ronment dominated bv Microsoft, the
next two years should be really inter
esting, as Microsoft battles to improve
iis foothold on the consumer Internet
expei ience.
