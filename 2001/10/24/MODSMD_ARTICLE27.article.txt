# MLS barely still alive and kicking

This past Sunday, the
San |osc Larthcjuakcs
tapped oil a storybook
\v< >r.st-to-lirst scascin In
defeating tlie I..A. Cialaw in a
thrilling 2-1 oyertinie \ictor\ to
win the 2001 MLS Cup and
honestly, it didn't e\en make a
ripple wave in the ocean that is
the American sports world.
lo be completely honest,
though I consider myself a rela
tivcb intense lan of the MLS,

c\en I could not
111 my bun
m>\ c*r body out
i >1 bed at 9:3()on
Sunday morn
ing to watch the
game. Instead,
like many oth
ers, I c hose to .
watch the high-

lights of I lit* finals on Sportscen
ter, which buried the story be
hind detailed coverage of Week f>
of die NFL.
And so, I 'm wonder ing how is
the \II S going to survive, having
jusl finished itssixtb season of ex
istence, if it can't get me, prctt)
much as rabid a sports fan as
there is, to watch the finals? ()i if
it can't get Sport scent cr to show
the highlights before dips of the
game between the winless W ash
ington Redskins and the 1-4 (Car
olina Panthers?
Without a doubt, the MLS is at
a cr<>sst ( >a<ls going into its seventh
year. With the YVorld ('.up next
summer, the league has an op
port unitv to capitalize on world
s(xcer fever â€” an opportunit)

tb.it it can't allord to miss \et
again. I.ooking back now at the
past six seasons, the MLS is defi
nitely not where it thought it
would lie in terms of its place in
the greater American sports
scene.
l lie I .S. National I cam's
dismal showing at the 1998
World ('.up, in which the I '.S.
failed to win a game, definiteh
did not help the league's cause.
It pushed American soccci back
in the eyes of all its beholders. As
a result, the league's attendance
has declined steadily year-to
year since its inception.
I 'earns have continued to play
in front of what has seemed like
absolutely paltrv crowds in huge
lootball stadiums. Meanwhile, no
new investors have come into the
league since 1998, and television
ratings are < loser to the Strongest
Man competitions on LSI'N'2
than those of any of the font
major American sports. L\en so,
there are still some recent signs
that the league may be steering it
self in the right direction.
First off, this past season atten
dance did not decline for the first
time since the third week of the
league's inaugural season. Atten
dance increased 10 percent from
last year, and nine of 12 teams
upped their ti< ket sales.
In addition, 19-year-old Lan
don I)ono\an, considered proba
bl\ the best young player e\er to
come out of the-1 .S., returned to
the- States from the (icrman c lub
