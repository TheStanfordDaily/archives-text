# Cal: Love it or hate it
## 
### 
Cal students are a horde of radical left-wing
protesters, marching around Berkeley — a
dirty, run-down city.
Sounds like a bunch of Stanford students
hurling insults at their across-t he-Bay counter
parts, doesn't it?
Well, The Daily wants to find out whether
these stereotypes are really the opinions held
by Stanford students.
We'll be running an online survey for the
next two weeks investigating these very issues,
and we would like to hear your opinion.
To find out, we need a little bit of your time

to help shatter — or reinforce — conventional
wisdom. A link to the survey can l>e found on
the Stanford Daily's Web site at daily.stan
ford.edu, or you can go directly to the survey
site:
