## The
						Stanford Daily Faculty, students, UAC can all improve advising 
### 
I'uhUshed Since IN9I

The Fat ull\ Senate adopted a resolu
tion this month advocating several
steps to improve advising for under
graduates. I his resolution is an im
portant Inst step in repairing the- spotty state
of Stanford undergraduate advising. We en
courage the Faculty Senate and the Under
graduate Advising (.enter to continue over
hauling lilt- advising system.
Pre-inajor advising could use the most
work, Currently, Ireshmen are assigned an
upperclass Peer Advising Counselor and a
fat iilt\ advisor, who could he a factilt\ mem
ber, a stall member <>r an upper-level gradu
ate student.
Students report uneven experiences with
their advisors. Some seniors have enjoyed
close relationships with their freshman advi
sors foi the past lour years, while other stu
dents cannot even remember the name of
their advisor. Perhaps this can be partly at-

tributed to lac k of effort on the part of stu
dents, but there is no doubt that cm rent fat -
uity advisors are related to the University in
so many ways that not all can offer the same
wisdom without standardized training.
Many advisors — through no fault of
I heir own — simply do not know enough
about the varied aspects of a large, academi
cally diverse university like Stanford. I he
Peer Advising Counselors and Head Peer
At 1 vising (iounselors sometimes fill this gap,
but their advice is not always sufficient.
()ne way to lix this problem is to standard
ize advisor training about issues specific to
freshman advising, such as I HUM and the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric. Advisors
with knowledge in this area can help all their
advisees with basic yet important questions.
Basic training would eliminate the problem ol
advisors who know little more about the I Hi
versity than the students they are advising.

Most importantly, those who volunteer to
be advisors are making a commitment to their
students that should not be taken lightly.
I hose who tit) not have the experience, the
time or the motivation to be a good advisor
should not take on the responsibility.
We also entourage the I A( 1 to increase the
number ol professors who advise undeclared
students. For many students, the advisor is
the primary point of contact with the faculty
and is therefore a good academic resource.
While stall and graduate students can be ex
cellent advisors, professors can share their
unique academic experiences and knowl
edge.
Advisors foi those students who have de
clared a major < an improve as well. Appoint
ing a faculty member to oversee undergrad
uate advising for each department is an im
portant stej) toward this goal. I lie advising
chief tan coordinate students, advisors and

the UA(! as well as help students who have
problems their advisor cannot answer. In
major advisors should be an significant
movement towards helping undergraduates
with research as well. Ifthe University is seri
ous about its commitment to increasing par
ticipation in research projects for juniors and
seniors, it must enlist faculty advisors to this
effort.
I he students are also an important part of
the advising relationship. Simply put, you will
get out of their advising what you put into it.
It is easy to criticize advising as insufficient
when you have not even seen your advisor
since you declared your major. Most faculty
are willing to help students who take advan
tage of the opportunities their advisor offers.
lb improve undergraduate advising, the
University needs to seek student input and
back up its rhetoric with specific proposals
and specific timelines.
