trying to reach the U.S. because
"these are reallv poor villages and
the soil's depleted. They can't farm

She filmed activists and patrol

day, she stumbled upon a local man
who did more than just watt li from
his backyard.
"He found out people were
dying an hour away from where
he lived and decided to give his
weekends putting water in the
desert," Antell said. She followed
him from one station to the next
and watched him leave jugs of
water, lie spent weekends sleep

tow truck when his car broke
down in the desert.

Antell t aught it all on film.
