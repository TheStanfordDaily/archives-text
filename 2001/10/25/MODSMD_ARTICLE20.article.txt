# RAREFIED AIR
## A 						tale of two sweatshirts 
### 
A leu (l;i\ s altei (lasses began, 1
look a t rip to tlu- Bookstoi v and
walked awa\ will) in\ ver\ own
Si an ford sweat sli ill You ve
seen the one I got — dark gra\ will) a
hood and big front pocket. "Stanford"
sewn in < ardinal blot k letters.
I wanted n because Stanford is m\
school now. Kven day I take my new
sweatshirt with me. I weai il while i iding
my bike to < lass and while sitting in the
(old classrooms, then I just lie ii around
my waist until night falls and I need il
again. It's been with me prettv much

non-stop siiu e I bought
it . . . until last week.
I woke up as usual,
showered, dressed and
combed my hair. I
grabbed in\ bag and
turned oil nn bedroom
light. Kut .is I prepared
to head out for the da\. I
paused. Without even

thinking about it, I deliherateh pulled
oil im waidiohe's recent pride .md jo\
and threw it over the l>«i< k ol m\ desk
chair.
I got down on the I 100 i ,md slid the
big plastic storage ho\ out from beneath
my bed. I lien I opened the lid and
reai hed lor a well-worn nav\ blue sweat
shirt. "I i ('.I I," it proclaims in loud gold
letters, "(leorgia Institute of l'e< luiolo
gv" it adds underneath in smallei white
st ript. I <|ui< kl\ pulled it over m\ head,
smiled, and walked out the door.
Scandalous, right? I banished m\ ( ur
rent si hoot's attire to the bat k ol .1 < hair
and flaunted the nameol m\ most recent
alma mater. W hat could I have been
thinking'- Well, lien 's mv excuse: I am a
graduate student. It's that simple.
Five months ago someone in Atlanta
asked me to walk a< loss ,1 stage and then
snuck .1 diploma into m\ hand. I didn't
even get the chance to object — to tell
them how nun li I had enjoved tm years
there, to beg lor permission to sia\ |ust ,1
while longer because I jusi wasn't ready
to leave.
Before I could react, I was gone, and
thinking about the "real world" gave me
nightmares, so I beaded west to gradu
ate school. As you can see from my
sweatshirt dilemma, adjusting to life be
yond m\ undergraduate past has been
somewhat difli< 11 It.
As part of .1 dinner set ics for graduate
students, I joined a small group for diti
nerwith Provost |ohn Kt< hemendv a few
weeks ago. < )vci the course of almost two
hours, we clisc ussed everything from the
Stanford budget to safeguarding for the
next big earthquake, but there was one
tonic th.it stood out in my mind: the
complaint that graduate students aren't
made to feel as mm h "a part of Stanford"
as the undergraduates. 1 can't help but
wonder if this is a true problem 01 just an
ordinary fact of life.

I've been ai Stanford lor an entire
month now, long enough to leai n to say
('to Mem, Colli) anil Mem And wit hot it
laughing. I've joined a few student orga
nizations and I am meeting new people
l>\ (lie dozens. I've learned the historx
behind llie Axe and attended a (ootball
game. I found (lie way to the Dish, and
I ve managed to avoid a bike ac cident. I
know Branncr sucks, even if I don't
know why. I'm entrem lied in homewoi k
assignments, but I can still weai flowers
in m\ hail in San Francisco and figure
out the way to San |ose.
I mention all these things to convince
you th.it I'm not a stereotypical graduate
student. I didn't come to California
met el\ lor some great pit>trss<>rs and the
benefits of si I tool name ret ognition, and
I'm not indifferent to the I niversitv.
A month has been more than enough
to sell me on the met its of Stanford, and
I haven't regretted my decision to conic
bete. So win can't I let go? Win did the
seeniingb inconsequential act of (hang
ing a sweatshirt have such an ellect? I
think the answer is prcli\ obvious.
(.eorgia I et h is the plat e I grew up. 1
arrived as a naive 18-year-oltl, anxious
to indulge in the freedom that goes
along with being away from your par
ents lor the first time. 1 left five years
later with an unexpected new wealth of
experience, (.eorgia lech frightened
me, tested me and rewarded me. It gave
me sleepless nights hand-in-hand with
lasting friendships. In the end, the
t lit lie turned out to be true — the jour
ney made me si ronger.
(Graduate school is different. I know
how to survive on my own and I'm confi
dent that I can be successful. Instead of
s( liool being tin full-time life, I'm adjust
ing to a full-time lile that happens to in
(lude s( liool. With so many changes as
sailing me at once, il should be no sur
prise that I'm comforted by the mere
sight of the name of my old school.
Why do graduate students like me
never full) ally themselves with Stan
ford? Mv guess is that the reason lies not
ma lack of effort on Stanford's part, but
in our fond memories of our undergrad
uate careers.
Kit her w ay, my sweatshirt story has a
happy ending. If you were upset tc > hear
that I'd tlitt lied my new Stanford appar
el. you'll be happy to know that I picked
it u| > again the next day.
So I had a collegiate life belorc Stan
ford. So what? (Georgia Ijrth was a chap
tei ol nn life that w ill always be remem
bered with .i smile, and il wearing my old
lech sweatshirt makes me happy with
the memories it conjures, so be it. The
Stanford sweatshirt w ill soon have its day.
