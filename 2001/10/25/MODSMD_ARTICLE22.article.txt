We write to you regarding I lie
Daily's publication of the article "l.nd
States l liat Sponsor Lcrrorism," I>\
Leonard IVikoff, on Fridav, Oct. 19.
Aside from disturbing members of
the Stanford conununit\ in general, tins
article has particularly caused great (lis
tless and concern among the Stanford
Iranian and Iranian-American commu
nity, as it is very inflammatory and
makes several offensive references
about Iran, short of suggesting geno
cide.
Assistant Dean of Students and Mul
ticultural Kducator l otumy Lee Woon
has made an incident report on this for
the Protocol to Address Ads of Intoler
ance and lhreats to the Community,
and i.ll a statement to several adminis
trators and stall members, the Dean of
Students, Mart Wais. acknowledged the
need to be sensitive to those who feel
(listrcssed by the article.
From viewing the article—promi
nently printed on the entire back page
— it is not clear whether it is an adver
tisement or an article representing the
views of the Daily. If it was an advertise
ment, we would have expected to see an
explicit statement printed somewhere
on the page.
We request that you clearly and pub
licly state your position on printing this
piece, specifically, whether it was an ad
vertisement, and if it reflects the views
and opinions of I he Stanford Daily staff
and / or editorial board.
The printing of this article is remi
niscent of when I lie Daily printed a
similar inflammatory article last May.
Sensing the controversy sparked by
David Horowitz's essay (" leu Reasons

Win Reparations for Blacks is a Bad
Idea for Blacks — and Racist too"), the
editors invited a student group that
the\ thought would be most impacted,
tlu' Black Student Union, to present
their point of view (" I en Reasons Why
You Shouldn't Be Fooled By David
llorowit/'s Ad — and Why It's Racist
Loo"). Both articles were printed in the
same issue of I he I)aily, offering two al
ternative perspectives for the Stanford
i ommunity to evaluate.
We believe that the publication of
I'eikoff's piece in I lie Daily is on par, if
not on a more incendiary level, than
that of llorowit/. We request that you
allow us to present a rejoinder to
Peikoff as you did with the BSU by pro
viding us space fora guest column.
We realize that responses to articles
are typically printed as letters to the ed
itor. but this would not have the same
prominence as a full article. Assuming
that the I'cikoll article was a paid adver
tisement, we do not have the same
means to present our views as the finan
cial supporters of this article had. 1 low
ever, as students of this University who
are financial contributors to The Daily
through ASSU special fees, we can only
request that you allow us to offer an in
formative, alternative point of view for
tlie educational benefit of the Stanford
community.
We hope that universities will remain
as centers for tolerance and discussion
of alternative viewpoints. As the prima
ry media organization on campus, you
have a fundamental role in upholding
this spirit.
