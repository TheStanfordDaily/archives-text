## Peikoff's article ignores examples of American terrorism 
### PRADEEP SEN GUEST COLUMNIST 
1 ..ist Friday, 1 lie l)ail\ published .i
paid advertisement entitled "laid States
Who Sponsor terrorism," b\ Leonard
IVikofL. While I respect the right ot I he
l)ail\ to publish this art it le, it is i liar th.it
the shallow argument provided l>\ theau
thot is nothing more than thiniv-veiled
hate. I he authoi lashes out .it Muslim
countries in the Middle Last with little ev
idence and calls lot tlicit destruction. He
fore we undertake the lolt\ ideal of lid
ding ourselves of these "evil" countries,
we must fii st realize that pet haps we, too,
arc guilt \ of I he t rimes Peikoll blames on
these terrorist nations.
I he bombing of an embassN. t he down
ing of a jet lit hi , or the destruction ola fac
tor) that kills hundreds of innocents with
the purpose of driving feat into the encim
are all well-known examples of tct rot ism.
We cannot embark on a w.u todestro) the
counti ies that perpeti ate these e\ il atroci
ties. however, without fiist looking .it the
wa\ out own government has comported
itscll. I lie truth is that we are not free of
sin either. As an \merican, I am ashamed
that the- I nitcd States h.is committed
even one of these examples of terrorism
in the past.
()n 111 1\ lONS, the American watship
I S.S. \ i in en nc s shot down an Iranian Aii
jetliner with 290 innocent people on board.
Ihere was no provocation; om govern
ment's official e\c use was that the radai s\ s
tems had confused the coninierc ial aii linet
with an I I I fighter. I low could the most
advanced waiship of the time — a $1 bil
lion Aegis-class ci nisei that w.is jokingh re
ferred to b\ Naw brass as "Robocruiscr."
with a racial svstetn so advanced that it
c ould 11 ac k 200 incoming missiles at once
mistake a I 75-foot-1( >ng commercial air
craft (capac it\ of uptolM") passengers) with
the miniature 1-1 I that seats two? I he

Naw s c\c uses are t< k> ridiculous to stom
al h. I Ins was simpK an evil ac t In commit
ted l>\ the I niteel Stales. I lie reason? Per
haps io mark the end of the long, drawn
out Iran-Iraq war which we had grown
tired of sponsoring. Perhaps to show Iran
ihat thc\ were too helpless to do anvlhing
but watch us shoot down one of tlicit < i\ il
lan planes. II so, we were light. I'hev could
not do au\thing about it.
I do not subsc l ibe to conspiracy theo
ries and certainl\ do not believe that the
entire I S. government is evil. Howexcr,
at some point in the c hain of command
the dec ision to shoot down the coinnier
(ial airliner was made. Instead of offering
reparations to the families of the vie tints,
the I nitcd States i efused to pa\ damages
and proceeded to re-instate economic
sanctions on Iran. In addition, further in
vestigatiou revealed that the Pentagon
lied to the public in its initial reports: the
aitc raft indeed had a transponder signal
ing "contm-air" (commercial airliner)
and was on its coned flight path at the
time of the incident. I he \ incennes. on
the other hand, had 11 legal I \ entered into
11 anian watei s.
Suppose fora moment that the roles of
the two nations had been reversed. As
siime that an Iranian warship sailed into
om territorial waters and proceeded to
shoot down, unprovoked, an American
airplane killing 200 innocent Americans.
1 here would be no doubt th.it we would
ti cat this barbat ic event as an ac t of lei ror
isni. Perhaps we would demand tli.it the
pcrsons responsible be brought to an in
ternational dial ot tribunal (which nevci
happened iu the case of the \ incennes).
Perhaps we would demand that those in
voked m the chain ol command be pun
ished (instead several of the crew were
awarded medals). In the end, frustrated
b\ the lack of results, we would declare
that the ollcnding nation was harboring
ten orists and seek oui revenge In military

action, perhaps l>\ openl\ bombing their
(itit*s like we did in Iraq and are cnrrentlv
doing in Afghanistan.
1 lie I nited Slates is the strongest na
tion on I .nth. ()thet nations do not have
the militat \ strength to seek revenge open
ly; alter all, onl\ the strongest can under
take puhlit displays of revenge. 1 his is a
tat i well understood l>\ anyone pit ked on
In a hnll\ during childhood. Instead, the
weak get revenge through sneak attai ks,
like the honihing ol Pan \in Flight KW
ovei I.(M'kerhie, Scotland latei that same

a hand in "retaliation" dining this at rot ii\.
Pel haps the\ did. Kit her wa\. we correct l\
londcnm the hoirific event .is ,i terrorist
ait. Nothing justifies the taking ol innocent
liws. However, had the roles been re
vet sed, we would < .ill the attack justified
and moral, the vei \ same lei 11 is we hear on
the news to describe out new campaign
against terrorism, regardless ol the inno
cent Afghans that die in the pioiess. I he
death toll mi I.ii is in the hundreds already.
Similai arguments can he made loi the
unjust bombing of the ( liincse Kmhass\ b\
the I nited Stall's in Belgrade on \ I as 7,
I 000. Liti'i. the I'nited States won I<l make
lhe pretext that we had atl.u ked the wrong
target because the bombing instructions
were based on .in outdated map. It is li.ud
tobelieveth.it I S. intelligence would be so
poor lo Ik- using antiquated maps, oi that
the\ would miss ,m obvious landm.it k sev
eral I .S. officials had visited before. Despite
repeated protests from ( hina. then' were
no international tu.ils oi tribunals to tin
(-over the true nat lire oh he attai k. ( )ne( I \
staff nu'tnbi'i was fired and si\ others re
ceived verbal warnings. If Osama bin
Laden had said that the bombings of the
embassies in Kcn\a and I an/ania had been
a mistake and tired one ol Inssi.iff members
and reprimanded the others, would we
have been satisfied?
I nlike the ( liinese, we were not going

to listen to exc uses w hen our embassies
were bombed. On August 20. 1008, the
I nited States bombed the hl-Shiia Phar
maceutical lactoi N in Sudan in revenge loi
the attack oi I .S. embassies in Kenya and
1 an/ania. Again, ibis turned out to be an
iiu (>i i ed target. I liei e was no evident e of
chemical weapons at this factory, which in
stead was ton lii n led to have been produc
ing medicine to relieve humanitarian suf
fering in Iraq. Ibis has been oui past
trend: to bulh smaller nations and strike
down those that displeased us. with no
othei reason than the age-old adage that
we are bigger and stronger than the\ at e.
I nfortunatelv, Pcikoll tloes not seem
to realize this in his article. He states:
"these innocents |in terrorist countries]
siilfei ant I die bet auseof the at lion ol t licit

therelore, is their government's moral re

We ai e not justified in seeking revenge
foi (he tragic attacks on Sept. 11. I nder
I lie 11lie ol law. there is no vindication loi
revenge. II someone kills youi lather, vou
cannot seek oui and kill iheii falhei in re

murtler. I las is true in the I nited Slates,
bee ause we are a nation ot law s. I lowever,
ha set I on the wa\ oui government treats
ollieis, we st em lo believe thai law tloes
not transcend past our own bordcis. We
seek revenge against nations tli.il have
caused us harm, instead ol seeking justice.

When terrorists, lui lcd I>\ lull ed of
