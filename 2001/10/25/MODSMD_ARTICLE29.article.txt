Stanford clinched .it least a tic for
first plat e in the Norl'ac West by de
feating St. I >uis on Tuesday and
can claim sole |x>ssession of the top
spot by defeating ('.ill for the second
time in two tries this season at 1 p.m.
on Saturday at Berkeley.
As if the Cardinal needed extra
motivation to down their cross
bay rivals.
"We especially get psyched up to

play them," senior defender Sam
I Icrman said.
I he (k)lden Hears are certainly
motivated, having sullered a 1-0 loss
at Stanford on ()ct. f>, their only con
ference defeat. However, they will
encounter a red-hot Stanford squad
that has won six consecutive
games — five by shutout — while

f< Miners, senic >r l< >rwai c 1 Kiici Swesey
and senior goalkeeper Rebecca
Shapiro, havelx'cnat the forefront of
the team's charge down the stiet< h.
Swesey has scored in every one
of the six wins, fora total of nine
goals, while Shapiro has been very
stingy in goal, and leads Norl'ac
with a minuscule 0.94 goals allowed
per game average and six shutouts.
Stanford's deptJi is impressive, as
nine different players have scored
this year. I he recent (iffensive explo
sion has been keyed oil ol ;i staunch
defense that has helped the( lardinal

lie aggressive and fearless on offense.
Similarly, Ixrause theolfense's good
execution hasn't left the delcn.se at.»

play more aggressively itself.

the great majority ol the time, and

a run into Stanford territory, the de

managed only three shots on goal,
and the Stanford oflense was able to
take X2 shots of its own.

California (9-1, 4-1) will lace each
other as ranked teams.

WOMEN'S FIELD HOCKEY
Saturday: Stanford at Cal,
1:00 p.m., Kleeberger Field,
Berkeley, CA

Stanford clinched .it least a tic for
first plat e in the Norl'ac West by de
feating St. I >uis on Tuesday and
can claim sole |x>ssession of the top
spot by defeating ('.ill for the second
time in two tries this season at 1 p.m.
on Saturday at Berkeley.
As if the Cardinal needed extra
motivation to down their cross
bay rivals.
"We especially get psyched up to

play them," senior defender Sam
I Icrman said.
I he (k)lden Hears are certainly
motivated, having sullered a 1-0 loss
at Stanford on ()ct. f>, their only con
ference defeat. However, they will
encounter a red-hot Stanford squad
that has won six consecutive
games — five by shutout — while
nu king ii|> 15 goals and only allow
ing one.
I he (lardinaTs two nxk-solid | kt
f< Miners, senic >r l< >rwai c 1 Kiici Swesey
and senior goalkeeper Rebecca
Shapiro, havelx'cnat the forefront of
the team's charge down the stiet< h.
Swesey has scored in every one
of the six wins, fora total of nine
goals, while Shapiro has been very
stingy in goal, and leads Norl'ac
with a minuscule 0.94 goals allowed
per game average and six shutouts.
Stanford's deptJi is impressive, as
nine different players have scored
this year. I he recent (iffensive explo
sion has been keyed oil ol ;i staunch
defense that has helped the( lardinal

lie aggressive and fearless on offense.
Similarly, Ixrause theolfense's good
execution hasn't left the delcn.se at.»
disadvantage or under undue pres
sure, the defense has Ixvn able t<>
play more aggressively itself.
I his offensive / defensive balance
w.isc spet ially apparent in I uesday's
2-0 win over St. Ix »nis. I he (Cardinal
pressured the Hillikcns' defense for
the great majority ol the time, and
w hen St. I .ouis did manage to go on
a run into Stanford territory, the de
lense quickly tookcontrol. St. Louis
managed only three shots on goal,
and the Stanford oflense was able to
take X2 shots of its own.
Stanford, though, isn't the only
team that's improved since the last
Hig (>ame. (lal, too, has improved
its level of play. After losing ,'i-l to
No. 8 Kent State on Oct. 1 1, the
(>oldcn Hears went on t<> win their
next three games, including a . r >-4
overtime victory against No. 9
