# Palliative care program supports terminally ill
## 
### GEORGE K. TONG 
Following two years of rest-arcli and
development, the I.mile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital last month launched
the Pediatric Palliative ( are Program. .1
comprehensive set of services designed
to provide support to terminal!) ill chil
dren and their families.
I he program oilers < oinfoi t c are for
patients and their families when < illa
tive options are exhausted.
"It is an active, total and compassion
ate approach, which includes physical,
psychological, social and spiritual dimen

sions. said Barbara Sourkes, director of
the program and associate professor of
pediatrics, in the Stanford Report.
I'lie program, unlike oilier palliative
set vi( es in the nation, encompasses a broad
range of medii al disc iplines in its outreac li
strategies.
"What makes this program unique is
that it originates out of the Division of In
tensive- ( are Medicine and not one of the
other disc iplines such as oncolog\ or pul
monary." said Di Lorry Frankel, direc
tor of the Pediatric Intensive Care I nil at
the hospital.
" 1 his novel approach is designed to

identify patients from all different dis< 1-
plines who might benefit from the in
clusion of Palliative Care in their man
agement," he said
I he program began under the ef
fortsof Harvey Cohen and Nancy COll
- who analyzed the needs of be
reaved families who lost a child treated
at the hospital.
"From their results, it became c lear
that we needed to improve upon oui
way of dealing with terminalK ill pa
tients and their families," Frankel said.
l he new program has developed
three distinct areas of focus.

First, it provides compassionate pa
tient counseling In select stall involved
with taring lot the child. I lie patient's
fainih tna\ he involved in this pr<x ess ,is
well. Ihe pr<>gt .tin also educates physi
cians and stall on how to provide pallia
tive t are lor patients sullcring from in
curable diseases. Uistlv. the program
emphasizes research development of
palliative (are.
" I he overall goal is i<> promote pal
liative i are as a therapeutic option w hen
(inalive (are is no longei available loi
iht- patient," Frankel said.
Along with patient care, the pro
gram provides support and comfort
to patients' families.
"The parents are the ones' who
often must consent to various ther
apies," lie said. "It is therefore in
cumbent upon tlu- institution to
provide the guidant e and psycho
logical support needed to make
these very difficult (let isions."
Already, doctors said plans are
in plate to further strengthen the
program and its services.
Frankel said he envisions hav
ing the palliative tare program
practiced more and in plates
where it is needed most.

"We will have a palliative tare
presence on rounds in the inten
sive t are units on a regular basis,"
he said.
Furthermore, the Program has the
npportunitN to work more closely with
the congenital heart program.
"A unique opportunity now
presents itself whereby the Pallia
tive ('.are (Consultants may become
engaged in the < are of the patient
with complex congenital anom
alies and help guide the family
with decisions," Frankel said.
Finally, the Palliative ('.are Pro
gram is looking at a partnership
with the perinatal diagnostic divi
sion ol )ohnson ('.enter.
"I lere, palliative tare consulta
tions may be obtained prior to the
child's birth," Frankel said. "This
may . . . provide the parents with
the netessarv information in order

for them to make a complete deci
sion regarding medical t are."
Kut the program will reside
mainly in the Pediatric Intensive
Care I nit, where it will provide
main end-of-lite counseling and
support services to patients and
their families.
"At the end ol lile, the whole ex
perience is about quality ol life,
which requires more personal in
teraction, not less," said l ess
Reynolds, whose eight-year-old
son was treated at Packard, in the
Stanford Report.
Frankel said he believes that the
program, funded primarily by the
John and Betsy kriewall-l laehl
Foundation, "will serve as a model
lor other pediatric programs as
they are confronted with non-cu
rative care lor their complicated
patients."
