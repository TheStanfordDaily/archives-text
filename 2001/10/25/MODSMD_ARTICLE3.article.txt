Following two years of rest-arcli and
development, the I.mile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital last month launched
the Pediatric Palliative ( are Program. .1
comprehensive set of services designed
to provide support to terminal!) ill chil
dren and their families.
I he program oilers < oinfoi t c are for
patients and their families when < illa
tive options are exhausted.
"It is an active, total and compassion
ate approach, which includes physical,
psychological, social and spiritual dimen

sions. said Barbara Sourkes, director of
the program and associate professor of
pediatrics, in the Stanford Report.
I'lie program, unlike oilier palliative
set vi( es in the nation, encompasses a broad
range of medii al disc iplines in its outreac li
strategies.
"What makes this program unique is
that it originates out of the Division of In
tensive- ( are Medicine and not one of the
other disc iplines such as oncolog\ or pul
monary." said Di Lorry Frankel, direc
tor of the Pediatric Intensive Care I nil at
the hospital.
" 1 his novel approach is designed to

identify patients from all different dis< 1-
plines who might benefit from the in
clusion of Palliative Care in their man
agement," he said
I he program began under the ef
fortsof Harvey Cohen and Nancy COll
- who analyzed the needs of be
reaved families who lost a child treated
at the hospital.
"From their results, it became c lear
that we needed to improve upon oui
way of dealing with terminalK ill pa
tients and their families," Frankel said.

three distinct areas of focus.
