his new album, "Perpetual Motion," Fleck teams up with an
other notcworth) crossover artist, Fdgar Meyer — a man
who plavs his upright bass like no other. I'nafraid to tem

Meyer can also 111.ike the bass sing like a trembling viola.
I ruly. he is a string quartet rolled into one.
Mever and Fleck produced and arranged the album, ac
companying each other on many of the tunes and recruiting
a 'who's who' of classical, folk and hluegrass artists for the
oilier tracks — a list that includes Cln is I bile of Nickel
('.reek and |ohn Williams, the classical guitarist (not the
Spielberg movie crony).
At first, one might consider this an unusual, even fin>l
- challenge. The banjo, with resonant mylar stretched
across its sounding board, has a tremendous attack, but little
sustain — a handicap when it comes to the smooth, legato
passages found in classical music. 1 he five strings are also
tuned at close intervals, allowing for fast picking patterns,
but preventing a wide range of notes and voices.
But Fleck is one of those innovators who, in the words of
Meyer, can "turn an apparent disadvantage into an advan
tage." Meyer adds that, while the banjo may be marked by a
lack of sustain, it can contribute a "clarity and greater densi
ty of notes." 1 his plu< k\ clarity, evocative of a harpsit hold, is
well suited to the Baroque pieces on the album. Surpris
works with the Romantic period pieces also. Fleck's picking
blur on Debussy's "Doc'tor Gradus ad Parnassum" matches
the impressionistic wash of sound that Debussy would have
been striving for on the piano.

"Moto I'erpetuo."
I hankfully, Fleck himself admits that the album was

ford's Memorial Auditorium, the two friends displayed
their diverse talents — both technical virtuosity and re
laxed improvisation — in .1 setlist that was only about a

In the opening, Fleck-penned tune, they offer up a sort of
rubric for how the evening will proceed. I he swaggering
melody switches between the even rhythm of classic al music
and the syncopated shuffle of hluegrass. even as Fleck and
Meyer alternate between the melodi( leading voice and har
monic support.
In demeanor, hoyvever, the two are polar opposites.
Mever — the (lassicalh trained music ian — takes a relaxed,
almost fluid, approach to the music, whether classic al 01 not.
Fleck, on the other hand — primarily self-taught, .1 ja// gu\
who considers himself a "poser" in the wot Id of c lassie.il musk
— is much more rigid and sternly attacks the music at hand
(though maybe his confinement and consternation are only
the result ola heavy banjo resting directly on his groin).
Meyer wins me over with his consummate music ianship
— and showmanship. Dressed with a loud tie and sus
penders. Mever is a bit like a W'eeble: he wobbles around the
bass, almost as if drunk — writhing, gritnac ing and swaying
rhapsodical!) to his music —but he never falls down. Dur
ing one Miles Davis tune, rearranged as a bass solo, Meyer
does it all, enthusiastically laying down a bass line groove
even as he coaxes a tremulous melody on top.
l'he obvious climax of the show is the requisite perfor
mance of "Moto I'erpetuo," necessary if only to prove that
the speed of the album recording was not some sort of hoax. •

"Moto I'erpetuo."
I hankfully, Fleck himself admits that the album was
mostly "just a stimulus for [ Meyer and me| to start touring
together." In concert, .is showcased last Saturday at Stan
ford's Memorial Auditorium, the two friends displayed
their diverse talents — both technical virtuosity and re
laxed improvisation — in .1 setlist that was only about a
quarter c lassic al music.
In the opening, Fleck-penned tune, they offer up a sort of
rubric for how the evening will proceed. I he swaggering
melody switches between the even rhythm of classic al music
and the syncopated shuffle of hluegrass. even as Fleck and
Meyer alternate between the melodi( leading voice and har
monic support.
In demeanor, hoyvever, the two are polar opposites.
Mever — the (lassicalh trained music ian — takes a relaxed,
almost fluid, approach to the music, whether classic al 01 not.
Fleck, on the other hand — primarily self-taught, .1 ja// gu\
who considers himself a "poser" in the wot Id of c lassie.il musk
— is much more rigid and sternly attacks the music at hand
(though maybe his confinement and consternation are only
the result ola heavy banjo resting directly on his groin).
Meyer wins me over with his consummate music ianship
— and showmanship. Dressed with a loud tie and sus
penders. Mever is a bit like a W'eeble: he wobbles around the
bass, almost as if drunk — writhing, gritnac ing and swaying
rhapsodical!) to his music —but he never falls down. Dur
ing one Miles Davis tune, rearranged as a bass solo, Meyer
does it all, enthusiastically laying down a bass line groove
even as he coaxes a tremulous melody on top.
l'he obvious climax of the show is the requisite perfor
mance of "Moto I'erpetuo," necessary if only to prove that
the speed of the album recording was not some sort of hoax. •

Hungry, hungry hippo.
II iht' world ol musical instruments were divided into

Dave Matthews,
adding banjo lit k.s to a
lew tracks on "Belore
Khese (Crowded

St reels," and operting for him in 1998. Fleck still seems in awe
<>l th.tt experience.
"It was kind of like .1 rock fantasy coming true as .1 banjo
plaver," he savs, apparentl) bemoaning the banjo's lack of
sex appeal. "I've alwavs been in bands that audieiu e like, bnt
I'd never been in a stadium with f>(),0()0 people s» reaming.
And the cool thing about Have Matthews in that situation is
that he handed it over to 11s."
1 laving tackled the iu kle college (in nit. Fleck now turns
his attention to a more refined endeavor: classical music. ()n
his new album, "Perpetual Motion," Fleck teams up with an
other notcworth) crossover artist, Fdgar Meyer — a man
who plavs his upright bass like no other. I'nafraid to tem
porarih take leave of the bass's traditional role as anchor,
Meyer can also 111.ike the bass sing like a trembling viola.
I ruly. he is a string quartet rolled into one.
Mever and Fleck produced and arranged the album, ac
companying each other on many of the tunes and recruiting
a 'who's who' of classical, folk and hluegrass artists for the
oilier tracks — a list that includes Cln is I bile of Nickel
('.reek and |ohn Williams, the classical guitarist (not the
Spielberg movie crony).
At first, one might consider this an unusual, even fin>l
- challenge. The banjo, with resonant mylar stretched
across its sounding board, has a tremendous attack, but little
sustain — a handicap when it comes to the smooth, legato
passages found in classical music. 1 he five strings are also
tuned at close intervals, allowing for fast picking patterns,
but preventing a wide range of notes and voices.
But Fleck is one of those innovators who, in the words of
Meyer, can "turn an apparent disadvantage into an advan
tage." Meyer adds that, while the banjo may be marked by a
lack of sustain, it can contribute a "clarity and greater densi
ty of notes." 1 his plu< k\ clarity, evocative of a harpsit hold, is
well suited to the Baroque pieces on the album. Surpris
works with the Romantic period pieces also. Fleck's picking
blur on Debussy's "Doc'tor Gradus ad Parnassum" matches
the impressionistic wash of sound that Debussy would have
been striving for on the piano.

Speed is certainK a 1 lei k trademai k Ile admits. "A part
of me is always attrailed to speed and flash and i titling it.
but there are a lot of otliei tilings that 1 lo\e too."
"So |).u t ol the reiord pm sues the banjo's pel petual ino
