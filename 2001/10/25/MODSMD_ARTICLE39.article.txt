boy bantls.
And yet, as the Backstreet Bovs sing
in "Kveryone," "they trx to pull us under
but here xve stand together and a mil
lion strong."
l he Oct. 15 Backstreet Boys concert at
the (loinpat| Clentei in San |ose indicated
that those who doubt the perennial popu

Dorough (the sensitive one).
KOl the encore, they performed with
soaring vocals the melting harmonies of
"Drowning." their newest song.
