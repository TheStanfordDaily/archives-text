While people who have been abused sometimes need
sex to be a vile plate where then boundaries are not
pushed, ti icntls in similar situations have often admitted
that some degree of force (>r powei differential is impor

tant in order tor us to achieve orgasm. I found that 1 like
to be 'topped' (a tjueei expression tin taking and keeping
sexual initiative). I often get most turned on when I lose
control and sm rentlei power during sex.
Keep in mind that this is all psvt hologicalb complex,
and w hat vou actualh do during sex is often t fillet ent from
what arouses vou most. In fact, its prohahh healtln that
w hat vou fantasize about ot what you're willing to imagine
is 11 if lei flit from what vou do. But it was important for nix
sexual development to be honest with nivself about what
tin ned me 011 and what got me off. even il some of those
feelings were unconventional and rooted in past abuse. I
would suggest t<> folks having srx aftet abuse: be careful,
but take what \oii need.
l inalh. tint ing sexual abuse main of us "left out bod
