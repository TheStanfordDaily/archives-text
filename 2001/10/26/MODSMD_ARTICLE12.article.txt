SC.N began organizing
Long Walk I lome concerts two
years ago as a wa\ to highlight
campus bands that do not tra
ditionally receive campus
wide attention.
For most of the bands per
forming at Long Walk Home,
the concert will be their first
public performance.
"The concerts are very infor
mal. lhe people listening are
usually simply walking bat k to
their dorms," said sophomore
C.ina Moon, campus coordina
tor for SCN.
"Long Walk Home" refers
to the walk back to the dorm
students take after a night of
partying.
Moon described Long Walk
Home as a low-cost operation.
Most sound and lighting is pro
vided In the bands themselves,
as are creation and reproduc
tion of promotional flyers.
SCN's street teams help bands
with flyer distribution if re
quested.
The role of SCN in Long
Walk I lome is largely organiza
tional. They select tlie bands,
book the venue and ensure that
the Office of Student Activities is
informed of the concert.
"S( 'N takes cares of the logis
tics, st> the band can just show

up and jam," Moon said.
