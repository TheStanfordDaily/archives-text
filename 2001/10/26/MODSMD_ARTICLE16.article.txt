## The 						Stanford Daily After Brentwood, Stanford's 'anthrax' response commendable 
### 
This week, Stanford had its lii si bi usli
with ilk- wave of anthrax attacks,
threats and hoaxes that has rapidly
spread across (he countr\ in the past
several weeks. Farlv Mouda\ morning a stallci
at the Office of Risk Management opened .in
envelope containing a threatening letter and a
suspicious, unidentified substance.
Shortly thereafter. Stanford Polite and Palo
Alto Fire oflicials evacuated the building. 1 he
building remained closed tli.it d.i\ and all of
1 iiestla\ .is the substance was tested fbi io\i( it\
in a lab at Stanford's Depai ttnent of I lealth and
Safety. lb the great relief of the commit nit v, (lu
minal lab reports have shown the substatiic not
to be toxic. Workers returned to (he Office
Wednesda\ morning.
After the building was sealed oil, several
building emplovces expressed frustration that
they could not retrieve important personal
items, such as cai ke\s,dooi kevs and food.
While n is important tli.it let lorist threats do

I'ublished Since JNVI

not completely prevent people from going
about theit daily lives, it is.ilso important that we
keep propel perspective. W hen a serious dan
gei sikh as the lineal of anthrax infection is pre

iiiediateK trump convenience concerns.

It is rather furious that some of those who
( ritifi/e the government for not acting sooner
to protect postal workers sav that the decision
to cancel I louse activity was rash.
(liven the nearh palpable levels of lear and

11 iu\ the i an< elation of meetings and a gen

greater victors for those who seek to injure
oui (iti/ens and institutions.
When weighing health and safety against
convenience, ii is the latter that should al
\\.i\s be the first prioritv. We commend
Stanford for its <|iii< k and thorough re
sponse. We hope the federal government
will follow its example to prevent another
disaster such .is that at 11 rent wood.
