Peikoff ad not a threat to community
DaraClhalueinani'slcliei totheeditoi ol

I oinim lec Win>n reported ihecoiilro\ei
sial Leonard Peikoll artii le printed in the
Daih <>n ()»I. 19asan iiu ident undci Si.ill
lord's "Ails ol Intolerance and I'h reals to
tin' (lommnnitN" protocol.
I am writing lo ask I Van Woon and
tin* Stanford i oniniiinii\ at large \()l
to treat Peikoffs artii It' as .111 "Ai 1 ol In
tolerant i'" or " I Illr.lt to the ( oninnini
ty," but as part of an inevitably unset
tling, oftt'ti often si \l' hnt ahsolnti'lx
necessary discourse ahont current
global events.
It is easv to understand why inan\
rommiinitv members were distressed
or disturbeil In Pcikolfs article. Please
ki'ep in mind, though, that practically
everyone 011 every part of the opinion
spectrum is frec|iientl\ disturbed and
distressed these da\s.
By way of illustration, I love my
countr) and believe that, despite some
indisputably had things we have done
in foreign affairs, the I'.S. is over
whelmingly a force for good in this
world. I am "disturbed", "distressed"
and "offended"' when I hear people say
that there is 110 moral difference be
tween the I nitcd States and the terror
ist bin Laden, or when I see people
burning an American flag.
Hut I know two things: 1) 1 have 110
right to never be offended; and 2) hear
ing and seeing these things I'd rather
block out makes me a better, more in
formed person 111 the long run. More
over. if I am upset, I can exercise my
own freedom of speech and tell the
world why I disagree with the opinion
or action that offended me.

Peikoffs artii Ic ma\ hi- inicnsch dis
turbing to some, but. .is Ms (ihahri'inani
.ind guest columnist Prailei'p Sen have
recogni/cd. the light response lot those
who are ollentled is to explain wh\
Peikoll's contention* are wrong, not to
demand that it and otlici similai l\ trou
bling spcci h he suppresseil. I hope that
the reporting ol the .otitic undct the
\( t sol Intoleraiu e polii \ does not por
tend sii( h c ensoi s| u|».

Labeling ad a 'threat' a necessary mea
sure, not suppression of free speech
I am in complete agreement with
Lara Mataac's sentiments and support
everything she wrote to I he Daih and
me. I 111 not surprised In her reai tion, be
cause the title ol the "Protocol to Address
Acts ol Intolerance and I'll reals to C.om
munit\" does not adequateh convey the
essence of this protocol nor how it has
evolved into the new official I nivcrsit\
Protocol at Stanford.
I lie Dean of Students Office is not
treating the report about Leonard
Peikoffs artii le as an act of intolerance.
Hut we do treat it as a threat to commu
nity so we can he responsive to people
who report their concerns to us and to
(lie potential impact it can have 011 our
community. The protocol is designed to
promote early detection and interven
tion for events that are potentially
harmful to any or all members of our
community. It also provides guidelines
for staff to coordinate communication
and actions to support and protect our
community not only against any expres
sions of bias bill the ensuing polari/a

lion that bias-related incident often in
cite. 11 is in no \va\ a standard for speech
or behavior.
I took the report from some Persian
students because the Dean of Students'
Office wants to know about these iiui
(Knts before lomnumiu wedges and
splinters turn into serious ruptures.
Asking foi (onununitN members onl\ to
report blatant hate crimes would hand
icap us in effectiveh addressing and
pi eventing t hem.
Kneouraging our community to re
port hurtful incidents that may be legal
l\ protec ted is .1 wa\ to c reate an early
opportunit) to develop partnerships
with a I fee ted parties.
I luis, recording such incidents in
our protoc<»l log as the letter from Dat a
('hahremani stated, communicating to
affected parties that we care, telling
ilicm the\ are not alone, protecting ad
versaries from backlash and urging
other conununitN members to support
each other does not mean we in the
Dean of Students Office are using the
protocol to discourage free speech.
fo be sure, and as a result of their
report to me, I had an early opportuni
ty to speak and to write to the Persian
Student Association and urged them to
avoid asking for any suppression of Mr.
Peikoffs right to speak. I his was a part
of tlu- protocol process for addressing
the offense they were experiencing.
Stopping free speech would contradict
the goals of the protocol because it
would escalate polarization by creating
another backlash.
Despite their many feelings at the
moment, the Persian students genuine
ly concur and value 112 ree speech as much
,is everyone in this community. I have
encouraged them to use their abilities to
speak to counter Mr. I'eikolfs state
ments. rhc\ have done so, and the\ are
planning to write more to address his
ad as well as to respond to (iary Hull s
presentation on Wednesda\ night.
Also, no one is asking that we go
through life without being oHendcd or
hurt, Conilict can be ver\ healthy. Ii is
how we handle these offenses that en
able ns to grow .mil to be a < i\ il societ\.
1 he protocol enables us to move
through community discord in a pro
ductive wa\ .md to raise awareness of

the constructive ways we can address
them to remain whole as a community.
In short, I believe I have acted ac -
cording to the values Mataac asks me to
support in her letter. I hope nn letter clar
ilies .ind i eassures Mataac and the c anipns
at large that the protocol has been a valu
able tool in mobili/ing the abundance ol
good will that exists on this campus to ad
dress threats to our community.

Sony ads tasteless, offensive
During the past couple ol weeks, and
again today. I he Daily has run a series
of ads which are offensive to both men
and women. I Itese ads. which are for

Son\ Screenblast, treat people .is ob
jcits to be used, shared, manipulated
and entered.
Inst. I want to mention I hat t lit- ad
vertising part ol this advertisement,
the section whit h actnalh explains
what the product is. is secontlan to
ever\tiling else. W hen one glances at
the ad. it is not ohvions what it is lor.
()ka\. so th.ii is nothing strange in the
advertising world. However, these ads
are ver\ clearl\ sending a diHerent tvpe
ol message.
I Ins message, w hit li is ahont the wa\
tli.it we tie.il people and ahont the wa\
th.it the\ want to be treated, is disgust
ing. I hesitate to nse this word, because
I leel th.it strong language might keep
vou Irom considering m\ point. How
ever. I am tt ul\ disgusted.
1 let e are some ot the phrases whit h

one encounters in the ads: I*la\ tne. I se
me anytime \ou like. I.liter me now.
Irv me. Spread me. I ratle me. Share me
with anvotie vou would like. (Control me.
Manipulate mean\ wa\ vou want.
Yes, these ads delinitelx have that
sexualh suggestive (or blatant) shot k
value. Yes, thc\ will get the attention
ol students on (o I lege campuses. I low -
evei. it is in verv poor taste to suggest
that anuine, man 01 woman, should be
spread, traded, manipulated 01 used.
We ma\ joke about these things
with tint Iriends, but I <loubt ihat most
ol us are open to being used, traded,
or manipulated b\ the rest ol the
world at "anytime and iu "am wax
you want". II the point ol these ads is
It) be cool, tbe\ have tailed li is not
tool lo suggest lb.il it is ok.ix lor
human beings to dominate eat li othei.

I liese ads mav empower the usei. hut
the\ disempower everyone else.
I would also like to point oui that in
cluding a man in the lineup does not
make these ads am less offensive. Ii
does not sa\ to me, "Oh look. I can t real
men the same \\a\s the\ treat women
and that's okav." Ii sa\s instead thai
people, no matter what their gender,
should feel free to use othei people. Il
is just as inappropriate to ohjectilx a
man as u is to ohjec tif\ a woman.
Please do not publish an\ more ol
these .ids. You are offending voui read
ers. Son> is .ii fault lor t realing this ad
vertising. You are responsible, howev
er, for not publishing siu h degrading
advertisements.
