## Read religious texts in-depth to gain greater understanding 
### DEANS FOR RELIGIOUS LIFE GUEST COLUMNISTS 
In iht- past several davs there li.is
been much clix 11 ssit>ii about 11u*
nature ol Islam. A |column| in
I lie l)ail\ ( hallenging the (liarac
terization ol Islam as a peaceful tradi
tion prompted responses l>\ membets
ol tlu- Muslim comnuinitv and on oth
ers on campus. \n anonymous liver
was posted in the History Corner and
the Ceologv building entitled "Read
the Koran." It < laiitis that the Muslim
terrorists were adhering to the teach
ings ol the Koran and lists ,i page ol
(I notes supporting this view . I here has

been circulating on campus, as well, a
page ol quotes from the Koran that .it
test to it being a religion ol peace.
As Deans lor Religious Life, we want
to affirm the importance ol reading ol
the Koran, as we would affirm reading
the I orali or Christian Scriptures 01
the sac red texts of other religious com
munities. But to do so In selecting a few
quotes either to validate or denigrate a
c omplex religious tradition does not do
justice to th.it tradition, nor does it take
into account the rich culture ol learn
ing and pi ac tic e which have grow n out
ol those texts.
Religions texts have initiated much
good in the world. But the\ have also

been used and abused to |iistil\ vio
lence, oppression and injustice. We
need to look honestlv at texts ol justice
and peac einaking as well as texts which
have been seen to provide legit imac \ for \ i
oletu e, exact revenge and initiate lear and
hatred in the name of the Sac red.
Religion and religious language oc
cup\ a centr.il role in our piesent c risis.
President Bush once dest i ibed this war
oil tei rot isin as a "crusade." initialh re
ferred to the campaign as "infinite jlls
tu c and repeatedlv characterized it as
a battle between "good" and "e\ il."
Osama bin Laden has invoked the
language ol hob war in an attempt to
mobilize support throughout the Mus

lim world. In our community, it is cru
cial that we do. indeed, educate our
selves about the violence which has
been perpetrated in the name ol reli
gion as well as the \irtues borne ol reli
gious laith.
What we need, in a universit\ com
mitted to education and c 111 i( a I think
ing. is to examine the texts of religious
communities in the compati) ol those
who can thoughtfully convex their reli
gious meaning, cult ural context and in
terpretive traditions. We are fortunate
within this I niversitv to have adher
ents and scholars ol main religious tra
ditions who are committed to free in
quit v and education.

Let us he willing to slum our own
texts and those of other traditions with
hoi 11 an open heat i and also with a < rit
ual iM'. II memheis ol the Stanford
