However, with Bay Area rivals No. 7 St.
Mary's (12-1-1) and No. 22 California (10-
4-1 2-2) rolling in on Friday and Sunday,
respectively, the crowds might not he as
one-sided as hoped.

But with the Cardinal's recent perfor
mances, Stanford fans should have a lot to
cheer about.
After winning two Pac-10 games at home

has won the last three meetings between the
teams. Stanford hist beat Cal at home in 1997,
winning 3-1.
However, the Cardinal must be careful not
to look too far ahead.

while not a conference game, should prove
more trying. I lie Gaels travel to New Maloney
Field with their first loss of the season still heavy
