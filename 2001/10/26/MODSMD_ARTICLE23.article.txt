### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
I lit* sixili-i .inked Stanford women's soccer
team (11-1-0, 4-0-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
would like to enjoy a home-field advantage
this weekend.
WOMEN'S SOCCER
Tonight: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 7 Saint
Mary, 5:00 p.m., New Moloney Field
Sunday: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 22 Cali
fornia, 1 2:00 p.m., New Moloney Field
However, with Bay Area rivals No. 7 St.
Mary's (12-1-1) and No. 22 California (10-
4-1 2-2) rolling in on Friday and Sunday,
respectively, the crowds might not he as
one-sided as hoped.

But with the Cardinal's recent perfor
mances, Stanford fans should have a lot to
cheer about.
After winning two Pac-10 games at home
lasi weekend against No. 1 20 Washington and
W ashington State, the Cardinal moved up to
iis highest ranking of the season in the most
recent polls.
List weekend's two victories secured a first -
place position in the Pac-10 for Stanford, one
game ahead of rival No. It UCLA (12-1-0, 3-0).
I lie Bruins are the only other undefeated team
in the conference.
"We feel ama/ing about our position in the
Pac-10," said junior forward Mania Wallis.
"We couldn't have asked for anything more."
I his Sunday, the Colden Bears hope to pick
up their play against the (Cardinal after a recent
slump. After lunging out to an H I record to

start ilu' season, (lalifornia lias gone 2-^-1 since,
dropping two conference games last weekend
to Washington and Washington State.
I'laying C.al is usually impetus enough, but
considering that no one on the current Stan
ford squad has ever beaten the Golden Bears,
this match carries greater emotional weight.
I he all-time series is tied. 8-8-2, and Cal
has won the last three meetings between the
teams. Stanford hist beat Cal at home in 1997,
winning 3-1.
However, the Cardinal must be careful not
to look too far ahead.
I his evening's matchup against St. Mary's,
while not a conference game, should prove
more trying. I lie Gaels travel to New Maloney
Field with their first loss of the season still heavy
on tlii'ii minds.
