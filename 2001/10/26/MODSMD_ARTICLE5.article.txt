### JENNIFER KONG 
Students, never fear —Halloween
at Stanford tins year u ill be «<s festive as
ever. Despite the terrorist attacks and
war that have dominated the head
lines, traditional Halloween celebra
tions on campus will go on as usual.
One of the biggest Halloween par
ties slated for this year is tonight's an
nual Mausoleum pattv. About 1,500
students are likely to show up for the
campus-wide patty, estimated Victor
Madrigal, director of student pro
grams of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
The location of the party will pro
vide a fitting backdrop for the Hal
loween festivities. Located in the Stan
ford Arboretum, the Mausoleum
houses the remains of 1 .eland and Jane

Stanford and I.eland Stanford, Jr.
I he Alumni Association has helped
to organize this event for about the last
10 years, according to Madrigal. Stu
dents usually attend in costume and
often come with large groups of peo
ple from their dorms.
" The party gives you a chance to
just let loose and feel the Halloween
spirit without going off campus," said
senior Susan Lee said.
Lee recalled seeing students at the
party dressed in a variety of costumes,
from a zucchini to the more popular
playboy bunnies and French maids.
Many students attend the party be
cause they enjoy dressing tip and im
mersing themselves in the morbid at
mosphere of the Mausoleum.
"It feels strange dancing in such
risque costumes on graves, but yet it

feels rather exciting in some strange
way," said junior l.ugene Lee.
Although the recent national
tragedy has spurred immense feelings
of patriotism across the country, many
said they feel that this will not affect
the traditional celebration of Hal
loween on campus.
Madrigal said that he doesn't think
people will tone down their costumes
this year in response to the terrorist at
tacks. "I don't think the students
would necessarily dress up in patriotic
outfits," he said. "People will still do
what they've always clone."
In light of recent events, additional
security precautions will he taken for
the event. According to Madrigal, staff
members will enforce senility at the
