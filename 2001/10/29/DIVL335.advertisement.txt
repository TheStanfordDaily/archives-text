Is your version ot
the four food groups
fat, sugar, salt, and .
alcohol? According to the
USDA Center for Nutri
tion Policy and Promo
tion, young adults have I
the worst eating habits of
all age groups.
But eating healthier foods
pays off in more energy, better
mood and appearance, and
lifelong health. It's hard to feel
good or do your best when
you're tired, grouchy, or sick.
Do yourself a favor: eat well to
be well. Some tips:
■ Remember the food guide
pyramid? Don't get stuck in
a food rut - variety, balance,
and moderation really count
■ Eat from all levels of the
pyramid, and mostly from
the plant-based foods in the
lower portion
■ Take advantage of the array
of fruits and vegetables in
California; try a new one
each week (had jicama or a
mango lately?)
■ Your peak bone-building
years are between your
teens and early 30s, so pack
in those calcium-rich foods:
low-fat milk, yogurt,
broccoli, tofu, kidney beans,
greens, and calcium
fortified orange juice
■ Green vegetables that are
dark green and yellow
vegetables that are dark
yellow have more vitamins
and minerals than paler
ones
■ Three vegetables that seem
to be especially valuable are
broccoli, carrots, and sweet
potatoes
Although this one small turkey is
a good start, let's hope dinner
included lots more carbos, fruits,
and veggies for all these Stanford
men in the IS9Os.
■ Three vitamin-packed fruits
are cantaloupe, apricots,
and citrus
■ Choose fiber-rich 100%
whole grain breads, cereals,
and pastas
■ Your body runs best on
carbohydrates, so try breads,
pastas, rice and potatoes
along with fruits and
vegetables every day
■ Don't overdose on vita
mins- if you choose a
supplement, select one that
gives you no more than
100"o of the recommended
daily allowance
■ If you tire easily and seem
more susceptible to colds,
you may be low in iron; eat
more lean meats, poultry,
iron-fortified bread and
cereals, dried beans, and
dark green veggies (that's
where the iron is)
■ Watch for added sugar in
yogurt, cereal, canned fruit
and hot cocoa
■ Take it easy on butter,
margarine, mayonnaise,
cream, oil, and dressings
■ Make a salad more nutri
tious bv topping it with
legumes (seeds, beans),
shredded cheese, chopped
eggs, dried truits,
and tofu
■ Drink eight to ten fl
ounce glasses of caf
feine-tree liquid every
day; more if you
exercise (go for plain
water, carbonated water or
diluted fruit juice)
■ Eating well doesn't mean
giving up favorite foods;
moderation is the key
■ Remember the 80/20 rule: if
you are a healthy eater 80%
of the time, don't worry
about the other 20%
■ Split a dessert with a friend
■ Focus on health and
exercise, not weight loss
■ Teach yourself to relax
during meals, and savor
your food
■ Remember, to reach your
optimum feeling and
performance, put the best
fuel possible into your body
■ Pop diets lack nutritional
balance and can be harmful
Snacks
Here are some good sug
gestions for healthful snacks:
Yogurt; raisins and other dried
fruits; non-sugary cereal; mini
bagels; pretzels; a banana, an
apple, a pear; skim or low fat
milk; string cheese; tortillas;
reduced-fat popcorn; a bag of
raw vegetables; whole grain
crackers (e.g. graham
crackers)
