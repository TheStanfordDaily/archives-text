Published Since IS 1 )!

On I-1 iday, I he I nited States
Olympic (It>mmittcc* chose the
Bay Area as one of four finalist lo
cations in (lie running lor nomi
nation to host the 2<H2 Olympics. I lie
ISOC will choose one candidate city next
\ear, whose hid will then he considered by
the Intcrnational Olympic Committee. I lie
possibility ol the K;i\ Area hosting the
Olympics oilers many exciting opportuni
lies for Stanford.
First, this would present a once-in-a-lile
time opportunity for most Stanford stu
dents and faculty. Because a Summer
Olympics on American soil occurs only
once or twice per generation, most of us
have never had the opportunity to view the
games lirsthand.
Second. Olympic (i.mies in the Bay Area

would bring infrastructure improvements
that would remain long beyond the (iames'
duration, foi instance, the 2012 bid includes
plans for the renovation of Stanford Stadium.
Stanford will also benefit from improve
ments made in the surrounding area. I he
2012 Olympic bid includes plans for the
construction ol an Olympic village and a
Velodrome for hosting cyc ling races. file
state-of-the-art Olympic village would be
constructed with environmentally friendly
materials. Especially beneficial to the coinmu
iiit\ would be the rental and home ownership
opportunities it would oiler after the games.
I lusting the ()lympics would bring many
thousands, il not millions ol dollars worth
ol capital improvement into upgi aded pub
lic transpoi tation, city infrastructure and
area cleanup, furthermore, private in

vestors' construction of new housing, retail
and entertainment projects would improv
ing quality of life in the Bay Area long after
the Games had left town.
I he (fames would also bring economic
stimulation throughout the area. Wherever
they are held, the ()lympic (fames invariably
bring many millions to local industries.
Plus, hosting Olympic events on campus
would bring Stanford additional prestige
and publicity. Although Stanford alreadv
enjoys national and international renown,
greater exposure could lead to even more
interest from prospective students and
renowned faculty.
Granted, there are certain downsides to
consider. Bringing thousands of visitors
and athletes to the region for several weeks
could disrupt day-to-day life for many Bay

Area dwellers.
Already, several local groups have voiced
concerns about potential environmental
problems, public safety hazards and the en
suing general mavhem the (lames might
bring to the area.
However, with proper planning and the
cooperation of local governmental officials,
community members and the Olympic
Committee, the potential downsides could
be minimized.
hi the short run as well as the long run,
hosting the Olvmpics would improve cam
pus life and the surrounding community.
I he benefits th.it would accrue — in terms
of economics and infrastructure —as well as
ihe place it would earn in our memories and
history, add up to make hosting the 2012
Summer (lames a winning proposition.
