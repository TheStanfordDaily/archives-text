been on the lips ol most ol the people that I
surround mvsell with: emplo\ ment.

"Did \oii get ,i final round interview at

"No. but m\ first tase with Banal (lon

It wasn't alwa\s this wa\. We used to gos
sip. We used to muse. We used to banter.
Yet ever situ e the perennial vet insullerable
(areer lair usurped White I'la/a .1 eouple of
weeks ago. the subjet t of investment bank
ing, vent tire capital and consulting has pep
pered all of our conversations. J Vying to
convint e in\ friends to < hange the subject
from job-chat is as dillinili as convincing
them to come lo inv room and watch
"Cruel Intentions with me again.
I be career (air was as mm h fun as her

"Are you smart enough?" I he woman at
the Deloitte booth had green eves and was
preppy and hot. Yet while the company
representatives were allablc and ret eptive,
the Ix'liavior of mv peers was dreadful.

But the job fair was only the opening
ceremon) of this charade. I he incessant
interviews that my friends have been going
through the past t ouplcof weeks have ren
dered them tired and jaded. I heir worst
case scenario has been a distinct reality: a
diminutive Vl', who didn't go to <1 st 11001
like Stanford and will thus eat nestly strive
to "humble" them, shakes their hand indif
ferently, berates them with inane question

farcical brain teaser, handling the whole
episode decidedly unprofessionally in

spite ol the "historical prolessionalism"
ol his fit m.
I lowevei. the List tiling I want to do is
perpetuate the inc leasing trend in conven
tional wisdom to dismiss all investment
hanking and consulting jobs as Laustian
and selfish. I n work lor an i banking or
i on suiting lit m alter graduating is not "sell
ing out." as common knowledge blindh
|x>siis. Iu the short term, such jobs are
often a means to an end: erasing student
debt or garnering acceptance to an cs
teeined business si hook No. ii ina\ not be
the high road, but perhaps the highwav
(insightl\ but last.
W hat is most ironic is that the kids who
are most vehement about the sterility of
sin h professions are frequentlv the proge
n\ ol W all Street tveoons and othei hard
core post-war capitalists I hesc kids are so
cjuit k to dismiss the linanc ial ser\ u es that
serve to "make I he rich ric her" even though
their parents' c areer c hoices ensured their
summers iu the Hamptons and their
(.rand (.herokees. Bv denouncing their
parents' fiscal route, these kids are refusing
to recognize the sell less and noble aim that
sustained a longancl olt-tiresoinecareer: to
ensure a resolute fiscal heritage.
Leaving a financial legacy lor your la
milial posterit\ has always been a common
denominator in the American I)reain. And
regardless ol vour conception ol domestic
.ind professional fulfillment, the realiza
tion of such visions has always entailed
self-made, sell-oi iented and self-sullic ient
virtues. I Itiniatelv these requirements
trump the obligation to leave a social or
sot ietal legacy. Should they r Perhaps not,
but In no means should a financial career
be viewed as base simply because it serves
immediate interests rather than humani
tarian ones.
For its part, however, Stanibrd could do
more to attract nonprofit companies and
teaching programs to recruit on our cam
pus. Investment banks and consulting
linns dominated the boot bed landsc ape at
the lii st career lair and occ up\ most of the
space on Stanford's e-rec ruiting system.
(.ranted, they employ a marginal per
centageol Stanlord students,but oneol the
reasons for ibis column's Icmiis on the li
nanc ier is to draw attention to the ('.areer
Development Center's fetish for him. If
philanthropic agencies and N(i()s had a
more visible presence, they would seem
more like viable alternatives to the capitalis
tic path rather than feeble defaults.
Passion and pragmatism are vying
forces in each individual, and the delibera
tions of each senior this week and in the
coining months reflect the volume of those
influences. I lie persistent c hatter about in
terviews and c ase studies in the past couple
ol weeks hints at a severe exc ess of the lat
ter. but I am prone to believing that the kids
who honor their altruistic proclivities are
sadly just less conspic uous.
