Nobel Laureate finds fault with
Sen column
I'radeep Sen's column in the Oct. 25
issue cannot go unanalv/ecl. I have no in
tention of defending the views ol Leonard
i'cikoll in his advertisement of()(t. 19; tlie\
are simultaneously immoral and unrealistic
But in his attack on IVikc>ll. Sen goes down
the line of moral equivalence and guilt
wliic h alwavsohsc ures genuine issues in lot -
eign policy.
Sen devotes considerable attention to a
lew isolated incidents. I don't pretend to un
derstand the shooting-clown ol the Iranian
«tiiliner, but it is ver\ clear that the bombing
ol the (ihinese embassy in Belgrade was an
error, ill c learh had no point, even accord
ing to the most cynical view ol American
aims. Sen does not explore the context ol
the bombing ol'Belgrade. We were there to
protect the (Muslim) people ol Kosovo lioin
what is usually regarded .is severe oppres
sion. According to Sen's analysis, we were
engaged in, "revenge," and indeed certain
ly killed innocent civilians, even if there was
no intent to do so.
l-ater. Sen pretty much justifies the at
tacks on the United States. I le refers to, "an
evil group that hates our foreign policies."
and then goes on to explain how wicked
those policies are; e.g., we "manipulate their
governments," as though these apparently
weak nations weren't manipulating us
through their command over oil.
I le tells us to stop "bullying," as though
the hatted felt lor us really stems from our
wicked policies. (Perhaps Sen does not un
derstand that the existence of hatred does
not imply that the hated is guilty of any
thing, as any vic tim of racism or homopho
bia can testify).
Sen goes on to deplore "revenge." I low
ever, in an international context, there is, in
fact, no c )verriding law c c >i responding to do
mestic law. We properly requested that
Osama bin Ixidenllix i turned over to us for
trial. It must Ix* said to be the responsibility

()l course, human beings and then gov

it is even more incumbent lor the powertill
to scrutinize their behavior than lot the

Military negligence not an act
of terrorism
I am writing Ixrause I object to an asser
tion tli.it guest columnist Pradeep Sen
makes on Oct. 25, entitled "lVikofl's article
ignores examples ol American terrorism."
Referring to the tragic downing of an Irani
an airliner on July 1988, Sen asserts that
tlie* U.S. Navy cruiser t'.S.S. Vincennes in
tentionally shot down an Iranian airliner
lull of civilians to make some son ol state
ment. Sen claims that the plane was shot
down to "mark the end of the war" or to
"show Iran that they were helpless." No
doubt, inexcusableatrocitieshv the I S. mil
itary'have occurred in the past. But Sen's ca
sual and mostly unsubstantiated assertion
makes it appear as if the intentional mass
killings of civilians are practices of the mod
ern U.S. military.
I he real story of the U.S.S. Vincennes
appears to be one of an overly gung ho tap
tain who unwisely and unnecessarily led his
ship into a highly confused and volatile situ
ation. I his. in combination with an untest
ed target tracking system that overloaded
his inadequately trained and poorly pre
pared crew ultimately led to the horrible
tragedy. In the end, it was a mistake for
which there can be no excuse. A Navy

(oviTiip, the unwillingness of the United
Slates to act cpt accountability, responsibili
ty .iihI liability lor the tragedy — these are
all legitimate topk s (or debate.
However, to inipl\ that a U.S. Navy
cruiser calnil\ steamed into Iranian waters
with the deliberate and express intent of
shooting (low 11 an airliner lull oft ivilians is
simply wrong.
1 here is a very important distinc tion be
tween gross negligent e and intentional
plotting to kill hundreds of innocent ( ivil
ians by shooting down their airliner. I.ven
(lie chicl ol Iran's Air Force at the time —
Brigadier General Mansour Salary —
made it (lean hat he did not think the Amer
icans actually intended to shoot down an
unarmed civilian aircraft.
lo compare what occurred with the
I S.S. \ incennes and what occurred on
Sept. I I and put them on eijual footing is to
utterly misrepresent what the U.S. Armed
fortes stand lor and lo grossly underesti
mate (lie (hanu ter and morality of our fel
low citizens in uniform. The soldiers,
sailors and airmen of the U.S. Armed
Forces, perhaps more so than any other
military on earth, reflect the ideals, be
liefs .uul morals ol their fellow country
men. ()l this, we should be proud. I con
sider myscll lucky lor having had the
privilege to serve with them.

Ghahremani, Sen pieces unfair,
misinformed
I he inacc urac ies in two recent articles in
I lie Daily have compelled me to respond.
Both articles pertained to the recent adver
tisement ol I'eikofl s literature. The first,
written by Data Ghahremani, called* the
I'eikoll artic le "inllainmatory and incendi


Campus Wisdom Watch is the Daily opinions staff's weekly, irreverent look at events happening around campus
ary," while the article written by
Pradeep Sen described the work as
"shallow and hateful."
However, what is clear from these re
sponses is that neithei author grasped the
essence of the Peikoll article. I grant that the
Peikofl article w.is» ryptic. but on one point
he was both translucent and correct: the
reemphasis ol powei in American foreign
polit v. Peikofl suited that anv constraint im
posed on the military eflbrt by internal
squabble oi maneuvering lines the eflbrt to
failure and disaster.
I'lindamentalk. the projection ol power,
isolated from the assurance ol force, is im
potent. lo deny the value of all means
and methods of war al our disposal em
boldens and bet kons oin antagonists for
ward — as von Glausewitz said, war is an
extension of diplomacy.
As the crux of the argument was hidden
within a smattering of invet live, 1 appreciate
that Ghahremani is concerned but, clearlv,
ii is entirely irrelevant to bleed about finan
cial constraints, insensitivities and intoler
ance during a period ol national upheaval,
and, specifically, in response to an article
that is insightful. I he discussion ol national
security issues and the safety of our i iti/enn
takes precedence during these times over
the personal proclivities of a select few
"members ol the Stanford community."
Furthermore, it must be stated that the
students who surely paid lor the original
placement ol the Peikoll article are just as
entitled to access or de facto return of
their fees if your panic ular group were to
receive anything.
With regards to the Sen column, it is
again obvious that the author neglected the
essence of the argument. Instead of debat
ing the merit of escalated militai \ prepared
ness, the writei undertakes ad absurdum
comparisons between American militan
ac ts and those deemed as terrorist acts b\
tin* \meric .m public. Sue li an approach is
\.u nons since most scholars consider ter
rorist ac tsas those pel pet rated In individ
uals while acts of war are those pel pet rat
ed In states.
Since the American people have never
been accused ol masterminding the attacks
outlined in his article, the democrat it gov
ernment therefore undertook such acts —
acts that other nations elec ted not to consti

lute as sufficient grounds to declare war.
I low ever, the recent attacks perpct rated on
this nation were deemed sufficiently orches
trated In a national government that war
was det Li red in .ill hut name.
I lie Peikoff article was not about Iran,
nor .iboul terrorism, hut about much need
ed dialogue on the use of military power in
the morphiug American foreign policy —
the need <>l sin h dialogue is highlighted by
the fad that individuals were willing to pa\
lot the original artii le to be made available.

Gary Hull's invective is offensive
Ac cording to Gary 1 lull, your politic al sc i
ence, humanities, economics and most all
sen ial s» ience professors are anti-Ainerican,
l)e<ausethe\ support multiculiuralistn and
brainwash you with the notion that Western
civilization is not superior to the rest of the
world. I le states that religion spreads dan
gerous. supernatural ideologies that foster
immoralit) and singles out Islam as a bar
baric, nivstit. bat kward religion. 1 le goes
on to sa\ that diretting the blame on ter
roi ists and tailing to hate .ill Muslims is a
disastrous attitude.
On W'ednesdav night, the Stanford Ob
jet ti\ isi ( Hub hosted (iary I lull, who spoke
on "I low America's I niversities 1 lai 1 x>r the
Ideas that Spread Terrorism" to a pac ked
lecture ball.
W e should not buy into the intellectual
conceptsof'p(>st-Modernism and relativism,
I lull said, instead advising the audience to
"define your own moral values." Yet in an
almost 11 lit it fashion, I full's every reference,
idea and seeming lile philosophy is based on
the writings of one individual, Ayn Rand.
When pressed on this obvious contradiction
between bis blind subservience to the \ iews
of Rand and his call lor independent t hoice,
I lull responded, in his deep wisdom, that he
has also read Plato and Aristotle.
Gaiy I lull is a professor at Duke I niver
sit\ whose courses and atademit worklcn us
e\t lusiveh on values and ethics as they re
late to capitalism and the marketplace. In
his lec lure, however, I lull extended his ex
pertise to Islam, foreign policv, education,
and world history.
I le spoke about 11 if nationalization of Oil
in the Middle Kast ant I then responded with
an embarrassed, "I don't know who that is"
when an audience member mentioned the

name of the key figure in the nationalization
of Iran's oil industry. 1 fe asserted that 11 if
United States was tlie first countr\ to use
technology for economic development
when we in fact inherited that notion from
the British Industrial Revolution and
maintained it through the ver\ govern
ment intervention practices he so vehe
mently detests.
I le claimed ih.it the Islamic faith is anti
intellectual and the i a use lor the hat kward
ness ol todays Muslim world, glossing ovei
(or more likely ignorant of) the f;u I that. If n
centuries, while Lurope was slill in the I ).n k
Ages, Muslim societies were indisputahlx
the sites for the major st ientific and intellcc
tual developments <>l the world, including
the development of algebra, then list r\ and
model n surgei). In lad. the Knropean Re
naissance was largeh dependent on the
mi ill i-< list iplinarv intellect tial com rihut ions
of the Muslim world.
I lull makes no distinction hetween
regimes and thee iti/ens whoarcexpc>sed to
their ideologies, between the religious senti
ments of ordinary people and the manipu
lation of religion for politic al ends, between
diversity and irrational relativism.
While extending his indiscriminate con
demnation of individualac tsof'tei rot toen
tire faiths and cultures, he readily Hips his
judgment when the terror in c|iiestion is
committed within I .S. Ixirders l>\ people
with whom he seems to iclentilv. ( '.laiining
now to be an auti-collectivist, llull assetts
that only the individuals responsible loi
these internal ac ts are bad and immoral.
llull adamantl\ states that those who
use force forfeit their right to life and
yet does not address how his own poli
cies of brute force or Americ as wrong
doings in this realm can be so easily ex
empt from ihis judgment.
My disdain was shared In otliei Stan
ford community members, some of
whom Iclt emotion.ill\ and plivsic all\ ill
after I lull's diatribes. Mis hateful and
vacuous speech offends the ii\ilii\ so
elcKjuenth expressed in President Men
nessy's recent statement on intolerance
and contributes to the growing iusei tin
ty of mam students in w hat is supposed
to be a sec ure intellectual envn on men t.
In the interest ol our shared humaniu
and the- virtuous freedoms out nation
stands for, we should speak out against
such perverted logic and divisive hate.

Yes, the actions ol American govern

but these people are trying to kill us.
Osama bin Laden and his network

All Americans. And regardless ol whether

Not jusi your political leaders, not only

I'm not s.n ing ()sania bin I .aden is irra

Oaecla does have a rational goal: to destroy

11sii,ill\ done nine h. nine h worse.
I he thing that really infuriates me, even
hevond slating that terrorism and I S. for

Military negligence not an act
of terrorism
I am writing Ixrause I object to an asser
tion tli.it guest columnist Pradeep Sen
makes on Oct. 25, entitled "lVikofl's article
ignores examples ol American terrorism."
Referring to the tragic downing of an Irani
an airliner on July 1988, Sen asserts that
tlie* U.S. Navy cruiser t'.S.S. Vincennes in
tentionally shot down an Iranian airliner
lull of civilians to make some son ol state
ment. Sen claims that the plane was shot
down to "mark the end of the war" or to
"show Iran that they were helpless." No
doubt, inexcusableatrocitieshv the I S. mil
itary'have occurred in the past. But Sen's ca
sual and mostly unsubstantiated assertion
makes it appear as if the intentional mass
killings of civilians are practices of the mod
ern U.S. military.
I he real story of the U.S.S. Vincennes
appears to be one of an overly gung ho tap
tain who unwisely and unnecessarily led his
ship into a highly confused and volatile situ
ation. I his. in combination with an untest
ed target tracking system that overloaded
his inadequately trained and poorly pre
pared crew ultimately led to the horrible
tragedy. In the end, it was a mistake for
which there can be no excuse. A Navy

(oviTiip, the unwillingness of the United
Slates to act cpt accountability, responsibili
ty .iihI liability lor the tragedy — these are
all legitimate topk s (or debate.
However, to inipl\ that a U.S. Navy
cruiser calnil\ steamed into Iranian waters
with the deliberate and express intent of
shooting (low 11 an airliner lull oft ivilians is
simply wrong.
1 here is a very important distinc tion be
tween gross negligent e and intentional
plotting to kill hundreds of innocent ( ivil
ians by shooting down their airliner. I.ven
(lie chicl ol Iran's Air Force at the time —
Brigadier General Mansour Salary —
made it (lean hat he did not think the Amer
icans actually intended to shoot down an
unarmed civilian aircraft.
lo compare what occurred with the
I S.S. \ incennes and what occurred on
Sept. I I and put them on eijual footing is to
utterly misrepresent what the U.S. Armed
fortes stand lor and lo grossly underesti
mate (lie (hanu ter and morality of our fel
low citizens in uniform. The soldiers,
sailors and airmen of the U.S. Armed
Forces, perhaps more so than any other
military on earth, reflect the ideals, be
liefs .uul morals ol their fellow country

Ghahremani, Sen pieces unfair,
misinformed
I he inacc urac ies in two recent articles in
I lie Daily have compelled me to respond.
Both articles pertained to the recent adver
tisement ol I'eikofl s literature. The first,
written by Data Ghahremani, called* the
I'eikoll artic le "inllainmatory and incendi


Campus Wisdom Watch is the Daily opinions staff's weekly, irreverent look at events happening around campus
ary," while the article written by
Pradeep Sen described the work as
"shallow and hateful."
However, what is clear from these re
sponses is that neithei author grasped the
essence of the Peikoll article. I grant that the
Peikofl article w.is» ryptic. but on one point
he was both translucent and correct: the
reemphasis ol powei in American foreign
polit v. Peikofl suited that anv constraint im
posed on the military eflbrt by internal
squabble oi maneuvering lines the eflbrt to
failure and disaster.
I'lindamentalk. the projection ol power,
isolated from the assurance ol force, is im
potent. lo deny the value of all means
and methods of war al our disposal em
boldens and bet kons oin antagonists for
ward — as von Glausewitz said, war is an
extension of diplomacy.
As the crux of the argument was hidden
within a smattering of invet live, 1 appreciate
that Ghahremani is concerned but, clearlv,
ii is entirely irrelevant to bleed about finan
cial constraints, insensitivities and intoler
ance during a period ol national upheaval,
and, specifically, in response to an article
that is insightful. I he discussion ol national
security issues and the safety of our i iti/enn
takes precedence during these times over
the personal proclivities of a select few
"members ol the Stanford community."
Furthermore, it must be stated that the
students who surely paid lor the original
placement ol the Peikoll article are just as
entitled to access or de facto return of
their fees if your panic ular group were to
receive anything.
With regards to the Sen column, it is
again obvious that the author neglected the
essence of the argument. Instead of debat
ing the merit of escalated militai \ prepared
ness, the writei undertakes ad absurdum
comparisons between American militan
ac ts and those deemed as terrorist acts b\
tin* \meric .m public. Sue li an approach is
\.u nons since most scholars consider ter
rorist ac tsas those pel pet rated In individ
uals while acts of war are those pel pet rat
ed In states.
Since the American people have never
been accused ol masterminding the attacks
outlined in his article, the democrat it gov
ernment therefore undertook such acts —
acts that other nations elec ted not to consti

lute as sufficient grounds to declare war.
I low ever, the recent attacks perpct rated on
this nation were deemed sufficiently orches
trated In a national government that war
was det Li red in .ill hut name.
I lie Peikoff article was not about Iran,
nor .iboul terrorism, hut about much need
ed dialogue on the use of military power in
the morphiug American foreign policy —
the need <>l sin h dialogue is highlighted by
the fad that individuals were willing to pa\

Ac cording to Gary 1 lull, your politic al sc i

I lull said, instead advising the audience to
"define your own moral values." Yet in an

the writings of one individual, Ayn Rand.
When pressed on this obvious contradiction

I le spoke about 11 if nationalization of Oil

an embarrassed, "I don't know who that is"
when an audience member mentioned the

name of the key figure in the nationalization
of Iran's oil industry. 1 fe asserted that 11 if
United States was tlie first countr\ to use
technology for economic development
when we in fact inherited that notion from
the British Industrial Revolution and
maintained it through the ver\ govern
ment intervention practices he so vehe
mently detests.
I le claimed ih.it the Islamic faith is anti
intellectual and the i a use lor the hat kward

(or more likely ignorant of) the f;u I that. If n

I lull makes no distinction hetween
regimes and thee iti/ens whoarcexpc>sed to
their ideologies, between the religious senti
ments of ordinary people and the manipu
lation of religion for politic al ends, between
diversity and irrational relativism.
While extending his indiscriminate con

With regards to the Sen column, it is
again obvious that the author neglected the
essence of the argument. Instead of debat
ing the merit of escalated militai \ prepared
ness, the writei undertakes ad absurdum
comparisons between American militan
ac ts and those deemed as terrorist acts b\
tin* \meric .m public. Sue li an approach is
\.u nons since most scholars consider ter
rorist ac tsas those pel pet rated In individ
uals while acts of war are those pel pet rat
ed In states.
Since the American people have never
been accused ol masterminding the attacks
outlined in his article, the democrat it gov
ernment therefore undertook such acts —
acts that other nations elec ted not to consti

lute as sufficient grounds to declare war.
I low ever, the recent attacks perpct rated on
this nation were deemed sufficiently orches
trated In a national government that war
was det Li red in .ill hut name.
I lie Peikoff article was not about Iran,

Gary Hull's invective is offensive
Ac cording to Gary 1 lull, your politic al sc i
ence, humanities, economics and most all
sen ial s» ience professors are anti-Ainerican,
l)e<ausethe\ support multiculiuralistn and
brainwash you with the notion that Western
civilization is not superior to the rest of the
world. I le states that religion spreads dan
gerous. supernatural ideologies that foster
immoralit) and singles out Islam as a bar
baric, nivstit. bat kward religion. 1 le goes
on to sa\ that diretting the blame on ter
roi ists and tailing to hate .ill Muslims is a
disastrous attitude.
On W'ednesdav night, the Stanford Ob
jet ti\ isi ( Hub hosted (iary I lull, who spoke
on "I low America's I niversities 1 lai 1 x>r the
Ideas that Spread Terrorism" to a pac ked
lecture ball.
W e should not buy into the intellectual
conceptsof'p(>st-Modernism and relativism,
I lull said, instead advising the audience to
"define your own moral values." Yet in an
almost 11 lit it fashion, I full's every reference,
idea and seeming lile philosophy is based on
the writings of one individual, Ayn Rand.
When pressed on this obvious contradiction
between bis blind subservience to the \ iews
of Rand and his call lor independent t hoice,
I lull responded, in his deep wisdom, that he
has also read Plato and Aristotle.
Gaiy I lull is a professor at Duke I niver
sit\ whose courses and atademit worklcn us
e\t lusiveh on values and ethics as they re
late to capitalism and the marketplace. In
his lec lure, however, I lull extended his ex
pertise to Islam, foreign policv, education,
and world history.
I le spoke about 11 if nationalization of Oil
in the Middle Kast ant I then responded with
an embarrassed, "I don't know who that is"
when an audience member mentioned the

name of the key figure in the nationalization
of Iran's oil industry. 1 fe asserted that 11 if
United States was tlie first countr\ to use
technology for economic development
when we in fact inherited that notion from
the British Industrial Revolution and
maintained it through the ver\ govern
ment intervention practices he so vehe
mently detests.
I le claimed ih.it the Islamic faith is anti
intellectual and the i a use lor the hat kward
ness ol todays Muslim world, glossing ovei
(or more likely ignorant of) the f;u I that. If n
centuries, while Lurope was slill in the I ).n k
Ages, Muslim societies were indisputahlx
the sites for the major st ientific and intellcc
tual developments <>l the world, including
the development of algebra, then list r\ and
model n surgei). In lad. the Knropean Re
naissance was largeh dependent on the
mi ill i-< list iplinarv intellect tial com rihut ions
of the Muslim world.
I lull makes no distinction hetween
regimes and thee iti/ens whoarcexpc>sed to
their ideologies, between the religious senti
ments of ordinary people and the manipu
lation of religion for politic al ends, between
diversity and irrational relativism.
While extending his indiscriminate con
demnation of individualac tsof'tei rot toen
tire faiths and cultures, he readily Hips his
judgment when the terror in c|iiestion is
committed within I .S. Ixirders l>\ people
with whom he seems to iclentilv. ( '.laiining
now to be an auti-collectivist, llull assetts
that only the individuals responsible loi
these internal ac ts are bad and immoral.
llull adamantl\ states that those who
use force forfeit their right to life and
yet does not address how his own poli
cies of brute force or Americ as wrong
doings in this realm can be so easily ex
empt from ihis judgment.
My disdain was shared In otliei Stan
ford community members, some of
whom Iclt emotion.ill\ and plivsic all\ ill
after I lull's diatribes. Mis hateful and
vacuous speech offends the ii\ilii\ so

Sen devotes considerable attention to a

ol the (ihinese embassy in Belgrade was an
error, ill c learh had no point, even accord

what is usually regarded .is severe oppres

engaged in, "revenge," and indeed certain

no intent to do so.
l-ater. Sen pretty much justifies the at

and then goes on to explain how wicked
those policies are; e.g., we "manipulate their
governments," as though these apparently
weak nations weren't manipulating us
through their command over oil.
I le tells us to stop "bullying," as though
the hatted felt lor us really stems from our
wicked policies. (Perhaps Sen does not un
derstand that the existence of hatred does
not imply that the hated is guilty of any

Military negligence not an act
of terrorism
I am writing Ixrause I object to an asser
tion tli.it guest columnist Pradeep Sen
makes on Oct. 25, entitled "lVikofl's article
ignores examples ol American terrorism."
Referring to the tragic downing of an Irani
an airliner on July 1988, Sen asserts that
tlie* U.S. Navy cruiser t'.S.S. Vincennes in
tentionally shot down an Iranian airliner
lull of civilians to make some son ol state
ment. Sen claims that the plane was shot
down to "mark the end of the war" or to
"show Iran that they were helpless." No
doubt, inexcusableatrocitieshv the I S. mil
itary'have occurred in the past. But Sen's ca
sual and mostly unsubstantiated assertion
makes it appear as if the intentional mass
killings of civilians are practices of the mod
ern U.S. military.
I he real story of the U.S.S. Vincennes
appears to be one of an overly gung ho tap
tain who unwisely and unnecessarily led his
ship into a highly confused and volatile situ
ation. I his. in combination with an untest
ed target tracking system that overloaded
his inadequately trained and poorly pre
pared crew ultimately led to the horrible
tragedy. In the end, it was a mistake for
which there can be no excuse. A Navy

(oviTiip, the unwillingness of the United
Slates to act cpt accountability, responsibili
ty .iihI liability lor the tragedy — these are
all legitimate topk s (or debate.
However, to inipl\ that a U.S. Navy
cruiser calnil\ steamed into Iranian waters
with the deliberate and express intent of
shooting (low 11 an airliner lull oft ivilians is
simply wrong.
1 here is a very important distinc tion be
tween gross negligent e and intentional
plotting to kill hundreds of innocent ( ivil
ians by shooting down their airliner. I.ven
(lie chicl ol Iran's Air Force at the time —
Brigadier General Mansour Salary —
made it (lean hat he did not think the Amer
icans actually intended to shoot down an
unarmed civilian aircraft.
lo compare what occurred with the
I S.S. \ incennes and what occurred on
Sept. I I and put them on eijual footing is to
utterly misrepresent what the U.S. Armed
fortes stand lor and lo grossly underesti
mate (lie (hanu ter and morality of our fel
low citizens in uniform. The soldiers,
sailors and airmen of the U.S. Armed
Forces, perhaps more so than any other
military on earth, reflect the ideals, be
liefs .uul morals ol their fellow country

Ghahremani, Sen pieces unfair,
misinformed
I he inacc urac ies in two recent articles in
I lie Daily have compelled me to respond.
Both articles pertained to the recent adver
tisement ol I'eikofl s literature. The first,
written by Data Ghahremani, called* the
I'eikoll artic le "inllainmatory and incendi


Campus Wisdom Watch is the Daily opinions staff's weekly, irreverent look at events happening around campus
ary," while the article written by
Pradeep Sen described the work as
"shallow and hateful."
However, what is clear from these re
sponses is that neithei author grasped the
essence of the Peikoll article. I grant that the
Peikofl article w.is» ryptic. but on one point
he was both translucent and correct: the
reemphasis ol powei in American foreign
polit v. Peikofl suited that anv constraint im
posed on the military eflbrt by internal
squabble oi maneuvering lines the eflbrt to
failure and disaster.
I'lindamentalk. the projection ol power,
isolated from the assurance ol force, is im
potent. lo deny the value of all means
and methods of war al our disposal em
boldens and bet kons oin antagonists for
ward — as von Glausewitz said, war is an
extension of diplomacy.
As the crux of the argument was hidden
within a smattering of invet live, 1 appreciate
that Ghahremani is concerned but, clearlv,
ii is entirely irrelevant to bleed about finan
cial constraints, insensitivities and intoler
ance during a period ol national upheaval,
and, specifically, in response to an article
that is insightful. I he discussion ol national
security issues and the safety of our i iti/enn
takes precedence during these times over
the personal proclivities of a select few
"members ol the Stanford community."
Furthermore, it must be stated that the
students who surely paid lor the original
placement ol the Peikoll article are just as
entitled to access or de facto return of
their fees if your panic ular group were to
receive anything.
With regards to the Sen column, it is
again obvious that the author neglected the
essence of the argument. Instead of debat

Military negligence not an act
of terrorism
I am writing Ixrause I object to an asser
tion tli.it guest columnist Pradeep Sen
makes on Oct. 25, entitled "lVikofl's article
ignores examples ol American terrorism."
Referring to the tragic downing of an Irani
an airliner on July 1988, Sen asserts that
tlie* U.S. Navy cruiser t'.S.S. Vincennes in
tentionally shot down an Iranian airliner
lull of civilians to make some son ol state
ment. Sen claims that the plane was shot
down to "mark the end of the war" or to
"show Iran that they were helpless." No
doubt, inexcusableatrocitieshv the I S. mil
itary'have occurred in the past. But Sen's ca
sual and mostly unsubstantiated assertion
makes it appear as if the intentional mass
killings of civilians are practices of the mod
ern U.S. military.
I he real story of the U.S.S. Vincennes
appears to be one of an overly gung ho tap
tain who unwisely and unnecessarily led his
ship into a highly confused and volatile situ
ation. I his. in combination with an untest
ed target tracking system that overloaded
his inadequately trained and poorly pre
pared crew ultimately led to the horrible
tragedy. In the end, it was a mistake for
which there can be no excuse. A Navy

(oviTiip, the unwillingness of the United
Slates to act cpt accountability, responsibili
ty .iihI liability lor the tragedy — these are
all legitimate topk s (or debate.
However, to inipl\ that a U.S. Navy
cruiser calnil\ steamed into Iranian waters
with the deliberate and express intent of
shooting (low 11 an airliner lull oft ivilians is
simply wrong.
1 here is a very important distinc tion be
tween gross negligent e and intentional
plotting to kill hundreds of innocent ( ivil
ians by shooting down their airliner. I.ven
(lie chicl ol Iran's Air Force at the time —
Brigadier General Mansour Salary —
made it (lean hat he did not think the Amer
icans actually intended to shoot down an
unarmed civilian aircraft.
lo compare what occurred with the
I S.S. \ incennes and what occurred on
Sept. I I and put them on eijual footing is to
utterly misrepresent what the U.S. Armed
fortes stand lor and lo grossly underesti
mate (lie (hanu ter and morality of our fel
low citizens in uniform. The soldiers,
sailors and airmen of the U.S. Armed
Forces, perhaps more so than any other
military on earth, reflect the ideals, be
liefs .uul morals ol their fellow country
men. ()l this, we should be proud. I con
sider myscll lucky lor having had the
privilege to serve with them.

Ghahremani, Sen pieces unfair,
misinformed
I he inacc urac ies in two recent articles in
I lie Daily have compelled me to respond.
Both articles pertained to the recent adver
tisement ol I'eikofl s literature. The first,
written by Data Ghahremani, called* the
I'eikoll artic le "inllainmatory and incendi


Campus Wisdom Watch is the Daily opinions staff's weekly, irreverent look at events happening around campus
ary," while the article written by
Pradeep Sen described the work as
"shallow and hateful."
However, what is clear from these re
sponses is that neithei author grasped the
essence of the Peikoll article. I grant that the
Peikofl article w.is» ryptic. but on one point
he was both translucent and correct: the
reemphasis ol powei in American foreign
polit v. Peikofl suited that anv constraint im
posed on the military eflbrt by internal
squabble oi maneuvering lines the eflbrt to
failure and disaster.
I'lindamentalk. the projection ol power,
isolated from the assurance ol force, is im
potent. lo deny the value of all means
and methods of war al our disposal em
boldens and bet kons oin antagonists for
ward — as von Glausewitz said, war is an
extension of diplomacy.
As the crux of the argument was hidden
within a smattering of invet live, 1 appreciate
that Ghahremani is concerned but, clearlv,
ii is entirely irrelevant to bleed about finan
cial constraints, insensitivities and intoler
ance during a period ol national upheaval,
and, specifically, in response to an article
that is insightful. I he discussion ol national
security issues and the safety of our i iti/enn
takes precedence during these times over
the personal proclivities of a select few
"members ol the Stanford community."
Furthermore, it must be stated that the
students who surely paid lor the original
placement ol the Peikoll article are just as
entitled to access or de facto return of
their fees if your panic ular group were to
receive anything.
With regards to the Sen column, it is
again obvious that the author neglected the
essence of the argument. Instead of debat
ing the merit of escalated militai \ prepared
ness, the writei undertakes ad absurdum
comparisons between American militan
ac ts and those deemed as terrorist acts b\
tin* \meric .m public. Sue li an approach is
\.u nons since most scholars consider ter
rorist ac tsas those pel pet rated In individ
uals while acts of war are those pel pet rat
ed In states.
Since the American people have never
been accused ol masterminding the attacks
outlined in his article, the democrat it gov
ernment therefore undertook such acts —
acts that other nations elec ted not to consti

lute as sufficient grounds to declare war.
I low ever, the recent attacks perpct rated on
this nation were deemed sufficiently orches
trated In a national government that war
was det Li red in .ill hut name.
I lie Peikoff article was not about Iran,
nor .iboul terrorism, hut about much need
ed dialogue on the use of military power in
the morphiug American foreign policy —
the need <>l sin h dialogue is highlighted by
the fad that individuals were willing to pa\
lot the original artii le to be made available.

Gary Hull's invective is offensive
Ac cording to Gary 1 lull, your politic al sc i
ence, humanities, economics and most all
sen ial s» ience professors are anti-Ainerican,
l)e<ausethe\ support multiculiuralistn and
brainwash you with the notion that Western
civilization is not superior to the rest of the
world. I le states that religion spreads dan
gerous. supernatural ideologies that foster
immoralit) and singles out Islam as a bar
baric, nivstit. bat kward religion. 1 le goes
on to sa\ that diretting the blame on ter
roi ists and tailing to hate .ill Muslims is a
disastrous attitude.
On W'ednesdav night, the Stanford Ob
jet ti\ isi ( Hub hosted (iary I lull, who spoke
on "I low America's I niversities 1 lai 1 x>r the
Ideas that Spread Terrorism" to a pac ked
lecture ball.
W e should not buy into the intellectual
conceptsof'p(>st-Modernism and relativism,
I lull said, instead advising the audience to
"define your own moral values." Yet in an
almost 11 lit it fashion, I full's every reference,
idea and seeming lile philosophy is based on
the writings of one individual, Ayn Rand.
When pressed on this obvious contradiction
between bis blind subservience to the \ iews
of Rand and his call lor independent t hoice,
I lull responded, in his deep wisdom, that he
has also read Plato and Aristotle.
Gaiy I lull is a professor at Duke I niver
sit\ whose courses and atademit worklcn us
e\t lusiveh on values and ethics as they re
late to capitalism and the marketplace. In
his lec lure, however, I lull extended his ex
pertise to Islam, foreign policv, education,
and world history.
I le spoke about 11 if nationalization of Oil
in the Middle Kast ant I then responded with
an embarrassed, "I don't know who that is"
when an audience member mentioned the

name of the key figure in the nationalization
of Iran's oil industry. 1 fe asserted that 11 if
United States was tlie first countr\ to use
technology for economic development
when we in fact inherited that notion from
the British Industrial Revolution and
maintained it through the ver\ govern
ment intervention practices he so vehe
mently detests.
I le claimed ih.it the Islamic faith is anti
intellectual and the i a use lor the hat kward
ness ol todays Muslim world, glossing ovei
(or more likely ignorant of) the f;u I that. If n
centuries, while Lurope was slill in the I ).n k
Ages, Muslim societies were indisputahlx
the sites for the major st ientific and intellcc
tual developments <>l the world, including
the development of algebra, then list r\ and
model n surgei). In lad. the Knropean Re
naissance was largeh dependent on the
mi ill i-< list iplinarv intellect tial com rihut ions
of the Muslim world.
I lull makes no distinction hetween
regimes and thee iti/ens whoarcexpc>sed to
their ideologies, between the religious senti
ments of ordinary people and the manipu
lation of religion for politic al ends, between
diversity and irrational relativism.
While extending his indiscriminate con
demnation of individualac tsof'tei rot toen
tire faiths and cultures, he readily Hips his
judgment when the terror in c|iiestion is
committed within I .S. Ixirders l>\ people
with whom he seems to iclentilv. ( '.laiining
now to be an auti-collectivist, llull assetts
that only the individuals responsible loi
these internal ac ts are bad and immoral.
llull adamantl\ states that those who
use force forfeit their right to life and
yet does not address how his own poli
cies of brute force or Americ as wrong
doings in this realm can be so easily ex
empt from ihis judgment.
My disdain was shared In otliei Stan
ford community members, some of
whom Iclt emotion.ill\ and plivsic all\ ill
after I lull's diatribes. Mis hateful and
vacuous speech offends the ii\ilii\ so
elcKjuenth expressed in President Men

and contributes to the growing iusei tin
ty of mam students in w hat is supposed

I'm not s.n ing ()sania bin I .aden is irra

I he thing that really infuriates me, even

is ili.it ( Kama bin Laden has no desire to

So, yes, I support the military cam

abhor the thought of innocent lives

Stop liiui from what? Killing. Killing us.
I believe (but obviously can never know
for certain) that the I .S. military is tak

And to Alice Walker and the rest ol the

dorse the idea of reaching out to bin Liden
