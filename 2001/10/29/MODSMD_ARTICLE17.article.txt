Sen devotes considerable attention to a

tacks on the United States. I le refers to, "an
evil group that hates our foreign policies."
and then goes on to explain how wicked
those policies are; e.g., we "manipulate their
governments," as though these apparently
weak nations weren't manipulating us
through their command over oil.
I le tells us to stop "bullying," as though
the hatted felt lor us really stems from our
wicked policies. (Perhaps Sen does not un
derstand that the existence of hatred does
not imply that the hated is guilty of any
thing, as any vic tim of racism or homopho

Sen goes on to deplore "revenge." I low

Military negligence not an act
of terrorism
I am writing Ixrause I object to an asser
tion tli.it guest columnist Pradeep Sen
makes on Oct. 25, entitled "lVikofl's article
ignores examples ol American terrorism."
Referring to the tragic downing of an Irani
an airliner on July 1988, Sen asserts that
tlie* U.S. Navy cruiser t'.S.S. Vincennes in
tentionally shot down an Iranian airliner
lull of civilians to make some son ol state
ment. Sen claims that the plane was shot
down to "mark the end of the war" or to
"show Iran that they were helpless." No
doubt, inexcusableatrocitieshv the I S. mil
itary'have occurred in the past. But Sen's ca
sual and mostly unsubstantiated assertion
makes it appear as if the intentional mass
killings of civilians are practices of the mod
ern U.S. military.
I he real story of the U.S.S. Vincennes
appears to be one of an overly gung ho tap
tain who unwisely and unnecessarily led his
ship into a highly confused and volatile situ
ation. I his. in combination with an untest
ed target tracking system that overloaded
his inadequately trained and poorly pre
pared crew ultimately led to the horrible
tragedy. In the end, it was a mistake for
which there can be no excuse. A Navy

(oviTiip, the unwillingness of the United
Slates to act cpt accountability, responsibili
ty .iihI liability lor the tragedy — these are
all legitimate topk s (or debate.
However, to inipl\ that a U.S. Navy
cruiser calnil\ steamed into Iranian waters
with the deliberate and express intent of
shooting (low 11 an airliner lull oft ivilians is
simply wrong.
1 here is a very important distinc tion be
tween gross negligent e and intentional
plotting to kill hundreds of innocent ( ivil
ians by shooting down their airliner. I.ven

Brigadier General Mansour Salary —

icans actually intended to shoot down an

utterly misrepresent what the U.S. Armed
fortes stand lor and lo grossly underesti

sailors and airmen of the U.S. Armed
Forces, perhaps more so than any other
military on earth, reflect the ideals, be

men. ()l this, we should be proud. I con
