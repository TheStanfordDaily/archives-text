Aided by arguably one of the
nation's most dominant offensive

which gave the Cardinal .1 38-28

In what may have been an early
dagger into the hearts of other
teams, the early UCLA strike did
not faze the Cardinal.
"This team has a great amount
of senior leadership, we look at ad
versity and we look at ways to over
come it," Heitmann said. "We
don't hide from it; if we get our
selves into a hole, we will figure out
a way to get out of it."
Calm and composed, Lewis led
Stanford on drives of 91 and 97
yards and at one time completed
13 consecutive passes.
With Stanford trailing 7-0, Ix'wis
threaded a pass to sophomore Luke
Powell to tie the game at seven. Two
drives later, Lewis marched Stan
ford down the field 97 yards and
punctuated the drive with a three
yard fade pattern to redshirt fresh
man I'eyo Johnson, who snagged
the ball with his right hand as he was
falling out of the end/one.
1 he Cardinal won the battle
on the other side of the trenches
as well.
Stanford's defense held Foster

to only 77 yards rushing and one
touchdown.
In a mind-boggling first half,
Stanford ran 24 more plays than
UCLA.
I he Bruins, though, have been
a third quarter team. Written
largely in Stanford's locker room
at halltime was "72-0," represent
ing UCLA's scoring margin in the
third quarter this season.
Sure enough, Scott McKwan —
who replaced an injured and inef
fective Cory I'aus at quarterback
— led the Bruins as they outscored
Stanford 21-10 in the second half.
After closing the gap to 31-28,
UCLA freshman corner Matt
Ware intercepted Lewis' pass on
the very next play from scrim
mage. Yet the relentless Cardinal
defenders forced UCLAto give the
ball up on downs.
"[This team] has a huge amount
of character," defensive coordina
tor Kent Baer said. "After looking
in their eyes, their was no doubt in
my mind th.it we were going stop
them and win the game."
