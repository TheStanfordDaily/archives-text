No. lOStanford. It just rolls oil the tongue doesn't ii!-
As good as it feels to sa\. and as good as a team
must be to hi eak into Ihe nation's top-10, ihe Cardi
nal is better.

Now , it's just a poll. Stanford is No.
13 in the LSPN I SA lbda\ coaches'
poll, even though it U at top-five teams
two weeks in a row. Win does it even
matter w hat a bunt h of self-important
journalists or uninformed coaches
thinkr In the end. wins and losses are
ninth more important than an arbi
trary ranking.
I niortuuatelv. in college football,
that's not the case.

Willi the advent <>l the B( S, the coat lies and jour
nalists hold much ol the college loot hall world in their
hands. (.ranted, these are probabl) the two groups ol
people wit 11 the most college football know ledge, hut it
sureh can't be told from their voting record.
(.an Hol> Thomas ol the Florida limes I nion,
altet watching Florida State upset unbeaten Mary
land and writing a compelling storv, sit down and
watch highlights ol Stanford's victor) over the No. 1
Bruins and make echu ated rankings by an earl\ Sun
da\ morning deadline?
For that matter, does Bobby Bowden realU have the
fortitude to forgo celebrating his team's victory so he
can pore over I'ac- lOboxscores and vote intelligently in
the coaches' poll Saturday night?
I lie answer to Im>ili questions is no. And.it no time
this season has the ineptitude ol the polls (and voters)
shone so clearly as yesterday morning, with the release
of this week's rankings.
First, a look at the Al* poll, which has Stanford .it
No. 10.

()nce again, No. 10 is nothing to complain about.
But m the BC'.S rankings, every number counts, and
the higher the (.ardinal is ranked, the greater chance
it lias .it contending lot .1 B( S bowl, or even though
not even I \rone Willingham will admit it.a national
(hampionship.
I lie two teams just above Stanford are No. 9 UCLA
and No. S ()regon — the two teams the (Cardinal beat
the last two weeks. Now logicallv. il Stanford defeated
both of these teams, the ('.ardinal is the better team and
should be ranked highei Maybe if Sum ford faced a de
pleted ()regon squad at home the pundits would Ik- jus
tified .it plac ing the I )u< ks above the ('.ardinal. Maybe if
1 )eShaim Foster s.it out and the Bruins lost on a few had
(.ills .md . 1 I.lst minute field goal. I ('.I.A could be con
sidered the better team.
()n the contrarv, Stanford was the victim of the bad
calls.it ()regon's tough stadium. Stanford trounced the
Bruins .it their own game, holding their 1 leisman can
didate to just 77 yards. And Stanford was the under
manned team, winning l><>th games without its starting
quarterback.
I'he F.SI'N I SA I oda\ poll's unsound logic hasn't
just nuclei mined the ('.animal's ac complishments, but
those of'the entire Pacific len ('.onference as well.
I'he I'ac -l()'s five ranked teams all have just one loss
apiece. and that lone loss was suffered to another mem
ber of the conference s ranked teams. Yet the highest
ranked I'ac-lOteam is No. 9 Oregon. Five other once
lieatcn teams are ranked inexplicably ahead of the I'ac
l()'s five, even though the\ plav in the nation's most tal
ented and competitive conference.
I'he coaches tabbed Florida as No. l\, forgetting the
(iators' loss to unranked Auburn. Mi<higan is their No.
('». ignoring the fact that No. 10 Washington defeated
the Wolverines in its season opener.
I"he deeper vou go in the rankings, the more you re
alize that the voters are about as precise as a Floridian


Matt Long
elct lion official.
You find UCIA al No. 11, one
s|)ot fx*low Washington, a team the
Bruins obliterated 35-1 just a few
weeks ago.
I hen there's Virginia lech at
No. 12, right above the Cardinal.
1 he 1 lokies lost to a mediocre and
unranked Syracuse team and
haven't beaten a ranked opponent

this year, with their best win coming
against Boston College — a team
Stanford also handily defeated.
But they're better than the
Cardinal?
l he more the rankings are an
alyzed, the more they make as
much sense as an Alaskan snow
cone shop.
If an 11-1 Cardinal squad or a
once-lx'aten UCIA team is doing
anything other than suiting up for
the Rose Bowl on January 3, they
have the fuzzy fogit of two groups to
blame: the coaches and the writers.
