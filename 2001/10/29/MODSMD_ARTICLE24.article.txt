In the same spirit as football's Big (iame and water
polo's Big Splasb, the Stanford Athletic Department
dubbed the Stanford women's volleyball team's
match against California this Friday "'Flie Big
Match."

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Friday: No. 4 Stanford defeated California 30-
16, 30-18 and 30-20.

"The Big Mis-Match" would have been a much
more suitable moniker for the affair.
The No. 4 Cardinal (18-2, 10-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) needed just 80 minutes to complete a sea
son-sweep of Cal (7-12, 2-9) with a dominating ,'M)
win in front of 1,785 fans at Maples Pavilion.
The Bears had hoped to build ofl a IJ-2 vi< tory
against No. 10 Santa (Mara on Tuesday — their
first against a ranked opponent this season
and avenge a S-0 loss to Stanford earlier this sea
son at Berkeley.
But all 14 Stanford players contributed to one
of the Cardinal's most well-rounded performant es
of the year — making Cal look totally helpless on
the court.
"We had to go up and be aggressive with our hit
ting tonight, and good passing enabled us to do
that," said freshman outside hitter Ogonn.i Nna
tnani, who tallied I 1 kills while hitting .500.
Nnamani also contributed lour service aces
doubling her careei high — as strong serving by
Stanford throughout the matt h kept Cal from ever
getting into a rhythm on offense.

I he Bears managed only 28 kills in the match
while hitting .it a dismal .138 clip, as they played
without their leading attacker, outside hitter Mia
|erkov, who was sidelined with a strained left foot.
With the Bears attempting to avoid Stanford's
conference-leading bloc k, \vhi< h entered the week
end third in the nation with 3.83 bloc ks per game,
the Cardinal only managed a season-low three
bloc ks in the mate h.
But the Bears' evasive efforts took much of the
thunder out of their attack, and Cal had a tough
time beating the Stanford ba< kcourl, which outdug
the Bears 34-24.
"We are averaging a lot of bloc ks per game and
teams are starting to avoid that," said head coach
|ohn Dunning. " 1 hey were trying very hard not
to make errors by hitting into the block because
they knew we had been hurting a lot of teams
with that."
Senior setter Kobyn Lewis posted a team-high
eight digs despite only playing in tlie first two
games. Junior outside hitter Logan loin added
seven digs.
"It's good to know ili.it we have good defense to
fall back on," s.iid Nnamani. "It changes the mo
mentum of the game and it gets people going and
excited in the match."
Meanwhile, the Stanford offense had a banner
night, hitting a season-high .40 I while pic king up
57 kills.
Strong passing allowed the Cardinal to get its
middle into the thick of the at tack. Scnioi middles
bloc ker I ara Conrad hit .533 with 10 kills while
sophomore middle bloc ker Sara McCee added
eight kills on nine attempts without an ei roi.
Stanford wraps up its season-long live-match
homcstand tomorrow against Sacramento State
(1 T>-. r >, 9-1 Big Sk\ ('.onference) al 7 p.m. in Maples.
