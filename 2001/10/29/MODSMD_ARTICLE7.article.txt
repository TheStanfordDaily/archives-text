## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN 
Following a meeting Friday in Salt
Lake City, the I S Olympic Committee
announced that the San Francisco Ba\
Area will advance to the final round of
competition to determine which Ameri
can city will bid to host the 2012 Summer
Olympic Games.
Also making it to the final round were
1 louston. New York and Washington, D C.
The USOC's decision has potentially
major implications for Stanford, as many of
the Olympic events would take plate on

campus. Stanford Stadium would host the
opening and closing ceremonies, according
to the Bay Area Sports Organizing Com
mittee. the primary organization putting
together the area's ()lympic bid.
11 a< k and field, the modern pentathlon,
water polo, softball and badminton would
also be held at campus venues.
"()bviously we are very pleased with the
USOC's decision," said alumnus James
Raybould (Class of2ooo /MA 2001). volun
teer coordinator for BAS()(1.
" I his has been a very strong volunteer
effort, and its going to continue Ix'ing that

way," Raybould said.
If the Bay Area hosts the 2012 games,
major renovations will be made to Stanford
Stadium as well as the other venues to ac
commodate the large international crowds.
"As a Stanford student, I'm really excit
ed that the Bay Area has made it to the final
round," said freshman Ad Shelton. "I think
it would Ik- an unbelievable sight to sec the
opening and closing ceremonies right here
at our stadium, and it would be great pub
licity for the school."
"Being selected as a finalist bid c ity is a
much-deserved confirmation that San

Francisco is one of America's greatest
cities," said senior Kenneth Garrett, a stu
dent involved in BAS()(1.
" I his is a very exciting time for BASOC
and other Ba\ Area residents that want to
sec the ()lympics come to the Bay Area in
2012," Garrett said. "Now is the time to re
ally dig in and make a concerted, coopera
tive effort, to convince the I SOC that San
Francisco is the best choice for 2012."
"I'd say that the Bay Area has three main
advantages over other cities — the envi
ronment, technology and weather," Ray
bould said.

Since close to SO percent of the necessary
venues are alteach in existence, few new fa
cilities would need to Ix* constructed in the
Bay Area, saving money and limiting envi
ronmental impact.
Also, because of their proximity to Sili
con Valley, the games could be the most
technologically advanced games ever, Ray
bould said.
Observers have deemed New York the
early favorite to win the I S bid, as it may
serve as a sentimental choice in the wake of
tlit* Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks that
devastated the tiiv.
Not advancing to the final
round oi bidding were I).ill.is,
l'ampa, (lint innati and 1 .os Ange
les. In about one year, the I S()(
will pick one ot the tour finalists to
represent the I'.S. in international
bidding, and the International
Olympic Committee will select the
host (itv in 2005.
