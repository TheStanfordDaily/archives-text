It's heen meditative. It's like ins earl\-

until the bagel delivei \ gu\ shows up. I've

I've had the time to ask the pc(>ple who
show up late what's going on. but I don't

a weird guv, Peter.").
But I resist, because I have some grave
questions for them.
(1) l it st of all, to make everyone ( hange
his 01 her watch .it the same time would be
a huge and costly endeavor. It obviouslx
would never work.
(2) Second of all, 110 one (an tell me e\-
