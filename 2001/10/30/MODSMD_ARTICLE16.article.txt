Peikoff fails to understand Iran
I lived in Iran during a tumultuous
lime: the 1970 Iranian revolution and the
war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It was a
time in w Inch a red rose within a blooming
garden wasn't red anymore, for there was
no one to enjo\ it. It was a confusing lime
in which happiness and well-being were
lost within the maelstrom of war. It was a
time in which the usual modes of life were
siipei seded by the struggle for survival.
I he 1070 Iranian revolution brought
about sudden change, in which a country
disenchanted by a corrupt. Western
struck autocracy was led to believe
through media and print technologies
that .i peaceful exile would bring true
democracy and freedom to the peo pie,
which never happened. Approximately
one and a half years later, Iraq, led by the
infamous Saddam Hussein, decided to

ovei take .1 \ ulnerable nation.
I hinkiug that bombs and air raids
would make Iran dot ile, Iraq set out fora
struggle which would inadvertenth cost
main innocent people their lives. 1 lie
irom is that Iraq, like Iran, is religiously
affiliated with Islam. Wh\ would.l Muslim
countn turn on another following the
same rules and regulations, pra\ ing to the
same (loci. - ' At the end of the prayer, a true
Muslim asks lot the well being of every
human being in the world. Surprisingly,
this wat brought death to thousands of in
noccut people. ()i mavbe this isn't so sur
prising, seeing .is how religion has always
been au effective outlet for politic i/ation
and subsequent conflict.
In order to survive the war or retreat
from a revolution turned sour, many Ira
nians came to the United States, in the
hopes of encountering opportunities and
contributing their vast knowledge and ex
perience to a new society. Their children
would eventually grow up in a society
where opportunities exist for people of
every race and color, where the freedom
to think and speak as an individual is not
seen as blasphemy.
et not a cla\ goes by th.it they remem
ber those who stayed back in Iran, every
now and then reminding themselves that
its going to start getting better soon: the
state of Iran is progressing, as it is more
democratic by American standards now
than it has ever been. But the light of hope
about reuniting the entire Iranian com
munity grows dimmer each day, as it
probably does for most American ethnic
groups.
In light Sept. 11, the United States
waged a war against "terror." It is clear
that the enemy has many faces, hence this
war may inevitably extend to other fronts.
An article by Leonard Peikoff appeared as
a paid advertisement 111 I lie Daily. I lie
author, from the Avn R.md Institute lot
Objectivism, gave several "huts" that im
plicate Iran as a Middle l-.astei n state that
"manufactures the most terrorists." I he
author further adds: "A proper war in selt
delense is one fought without st-lf-t i i| >-
pling rest 1 it tions plac ed on our comman
ders in the field. It must be fought with the
most effective weapons we possess. And n
must be fought in a mannei that secures
victory as tjuit kh as possible and with the
fewest I .S. casualties, regardless of the
countless innocents caught in the line of
fire, l'ckiofl appears to be supporting .1
measure that ma\ ultimately lead to the
deaths of thousands of innocent people.
Based on what I'eikoff is advocating,
the blood of countless innocent individu
als who have not been exposed to the
democratic principles he has, has to be
shed ill ordei foi us to reach international
understanding. I lie loss of humanity is 110

d( >es not suffei that loss. A line-In -line c rit

University should not neglect humanities
I. admittedly. am wi iling as a confused
student. I do not nuclei stand the yyoi kings
of bureauc i at a and business (still bay e not
taken he 011 I). but in light of w hat I glean
from I lie Daily . I have since compiled
someeontraelieton findings.
In the Oct. 2(i issue, Provost |ohn
f.tc heiiientl) announced that all depart
ments should submit 1 educed budget pro
posals lot the upcoming year (at a fixed
1 ate, indist 11 initiate todepai tment's grow
ing 01 shrinking needs). 1 don't under

stand (lit* need to cloNvnsize my education
or 1 11 is apparent lack of funding.
First, we recently received an un
precedented $400 million grant towards
undergraduate education in the Hu
manities and Sciences In the Hewlett
Foundation last vear (it was not alone in
recent record gift giving recently).
Second, it takes me 20 minutes to
drive across campus because there is
more construction going on than in a
newl\ founded city.
I bird, the cost ol attending Stanford
skyrocketed last year to an inhumane
$■17,000 —an eyebrow raising 15 per
cent increase in the mere four years I
have been here. II tuition continues to
rise at this rate, in 30 years when I send
m\ » hildrcn to college I will be looking
at fees ol $ 1 1 1 ,f>4(>.44 per vear
(37,000( I +(.15 4))30).
Since a lot ol this increase revolves
around tuition, wh\ am I paving more
tuition when the I niversitx is giving my
depart mcnt less mone\ to wot k with?
Perhaps I wouldn't be so worried il I
were an engineering major, whose de
partment alone continues to receive so
mail) grants that again, F.tchemendy
has decided it should somehow be the
measure ola "well-run" one (since when
were non-profits so obsessed with
mouey-making? And in providing inef
ficient services in return, such as the
Dining Services?). I his "standard" lias
meant that m\ tin\ department of
Comparative Literature, which just
doubled undergraduate enrollment last
year, has been labeled so "weak" (de
spite its rating that it sits near the top in

this country) that it had to be merged
with live other departments in an "effi
ciency" move that was so both contest
ed by everyone direct In involved that
again, 1' tc heinend\ decided to freeze .ill
hiring decisions, alienating valuable,
desperately needed potential incoming

looked .it the Bulletin this year knows,
that absoluteh no classes are being ol
fered in this department, noi in French
and Italian, which is reported to be the
fastest-groNN ing majoi on » ampus.
So. with a rescntlulh "merged" de
partment facing budget cuts again (it
was a bit shocking to learn that nvc are al
ready operating undei budget i ills 111 is

the upcoming one), I am frankh not all

niN department, which has done an ex

perhaps outdated ideal ol providing .in

Peikoff fails to understand Iran
I lived in Iran during a tumultuous
lime: the 1970 Iranian revolution and the
war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It was a
time in w Inch a red rose within a blooming
garden wasn't red anymore, for there was
no one to enjo\ it. It was a confusing lime
in which happiness and well-being were
lost within the maelstrom of war. It was a
time in which the usual modes of life were
siipei seded by the struggle for survival.
I he 1070 Iranian revolution brought
about sudden change, in which a country
disenchanted by a corrupt. Western
struck autocracy was led to believe
through media and print technologies
that .i peaceful exile would bring true
democracy and freedom to the peo pie,
which never happened. Approximately
one and a half years later, Iraq, led by the
infamous Saddam Hussein, decided to

ovei take .1 \ ulnerable nation.
I hinkiug that bombs and air raids
would make Iran dot ile, Iraq set out fora
struggle which would inadvertenth cost
main innocent people their lives. 1 lie
irom is that Iraq, like Iran, is religiously
affiliated with Islam. Wh\ would.l Muslim
countn turn on another following the
same rules and regulations, pra\ ing to the
same (loci. - ' At the end of the prayer, a true
Muslim asks lot the well being of every
human being in the world. Surprisingly,
this wat brought death to thousands of in
noccut people. ()i mavbe this isn't so sur
prising, seeing .is how religion has always
been au effective outlet for politic i/ation
and subsequent conflict.
In order to survive the war or retreat
from a revolution turned sour, many Ira
nians came to the United States, in the
hopes of encountering opportunities and
contributing their vast knowledge and ex
perience to a new society. Their children
would eventually grow up in a society
where opportunities exist for people of
every race and color, where the freedom
to think and speak as an individual is not
seen as blasphemy.
et not a cla\ goes by th.it they remem
ber those who stayed back in Iran, every
now and then reminding themselves that
its going to start getting better soon: the
state of Iran is progressing, as it is more
democratic by American standards now
than it has ever been. But the light of hope
about reuniting the entire Iranian com
munity grows dimmer each day, as it
probably does for most American ethnic
groups.
In light Sept. 11, the United States
waged a war against "terror." It is clear
that the enemy has many faces, hence this
war may inevitably extend to other fronts.
An article by Leonard Peikoff appeared as
a paid advertisement 111 I lie Daily. I lie
author, from the Avn R.md Institute lot
Objectivism, gave several "huts" that im
plicate Iran as a Middle l-.astei n state that
"manufactures the most terrorists." I he
author further adds: "A proper war in selt
delense is one fought without st-lf-t i i| >-
pling rest 1 it tions plac ed on our comman

most effective weapons we possess. And n

fewest I .S. casualties, regardless of the
countless innocents caught in the line of

Peikoff fails to understand Iran
I lived in Iran during a tumultuous
lime: the 1970 Iranian revolution and the
war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It was a
time in w Inch a red rose within a blooming
garden wasn't red anymore, for there was
no one to enjo\ it. It was a confusing lime
in which happiness and well-being were
lost within the maelstrom of war. It was a
time in which the usual modes of life were
siipei seded by the struggle for survival.
I he 1070 Iranian revolution brought
about sudden change, in which a country
disenchanted by a corrupt. Western
struck autocracy was led to believe
through media and print technologies
that .i peaceful exile would bring true
democracy and freedom to the peo pie,
which never happened. Approximately
one and a half years later, Iraq, led by the
infamous Saddam Hussein, decided to

ovei take .1 \ ulnerable nation.
I hinkiug that bombs and air raids
would make Iran dot ile, Iraq set out fora
struggle which would inadvertenth cost
main innocent people their lives. 1 lie
irom is that Iraq, like Iran, is religiously
affiliated with Islam. Wh\ would.l Muslim
countn turn on another following the
same rules and regulations, pra\ ing to the
same (loci. - ' At the end of the prayer, a true
Muslim asks lot the well being of every
human being in the world. Surprisingly,
this wat brought death to thousands of in
noccut people. ()i mavbe this isn't so sur
prising, seeing .is how religion has always
been au effective outlet for politic i/ation
and subsequent conflict.
In order to survive the war or retreat
from a revolution turned sour, many Ira
nians came to the United States, in the
hopes of encountering opportunities and
contributing their vast knowledge and ex
perience to a new society. Their children
would eventually grow up in a society
where opportunities exist for people of
every race and color, where the freedom
to think and speak as an individual is not
seen as blasphemy.

University should not neglect humanities
I. admittedly. am wi iling as a confused
student. I do not nuclei stand the yyoi kings
of bureauc i at a and business (still bay e not
taken he 011 I). but in light of w hat I glean
from I lie Daily . I have since compiled
someeontraelieton findings.
In the Oct. 2(i issue, Provost |ohn
f.tc heiiientl) announced that all depart
ments should submit 1 educed budget pro
posals lot the upcoming year (at a fixed
1 ate, indist 11 initiate todepai tment's grow
ing 01 shrinking needs). 1 don't under

stand (lit* need to cloNvnsize my education
or 1 11 is apparent lack of funding.
First, we recently received an un
precedented $400 million grant towards
undergraduate education in the Hu
manities and Sciences In the Hewlett
Foundation last vear (it was not alone in
recent record gift giving recently).
Second, it takes me 20 minutes to
drive across campus because there is
more construction going on than in a
newl\ founded city.
I bird, the cost ol attending Stanford
skyrocketed last year to an inhumane
$■17,000 —an eyebrow raising 15 per
cent increase in the mere four years I
have been here. II tuition continues to
rise at this rate, in 30 years when I send
m\ » hildrcn to college I will be looking
at fees ol $ 1 1 1 ,f>4(>.44 per vear
(37,000( I +(.15 4))30).
Since a lot ol this increase revolves
around tuition, wh\ am I paving more
tuition when the I niversitx is giving my
depart mcnt less mone\ to wot k with?
Perhaps I wouldn't be so worried il I
were an engineering major, whose de
partment alone continues to receive so
mail) grants that again, F.tchemendy
has decided it should somehow be the
measure ola "well-run" one (since when
were non-profits so obsessed with
mouey-making? And in providing inef
ficient services in return, such as the
Dining Services?). I his "standard" lias
meant that m\ tin\ department of
Comparative Literature, which just
doubled undergraduate enrollment last
year, has been labeled so "weak" (de
spite its rating that it sits near the top in

this country) that it had to be merged
with live other departments in an "effi
ciency" move that was so both contest
ed by everyone direct In involved that
again, 1' tc heinend\ decided to freeze .ill
hiring decisions, alienating valuable,
desperately needed potential incoming
lac ultn . 1 his means, as anyone who has
looked .it the Bulletin this year knows,
that absoluteh no classes are being ol
fered in this department, noi in French
and Italian, which is reported to be the
fastest-groNN ing majoi on » ampus.
So. with a rescntlulh "merged" de
partment facing budget cuts again (it
was a bit shocking to learn that nvc are al
ready operating undei budget i ills 111 is
year, which in turn must be increased
the upcoming one), I am frankh not all
that optimistic about the neat future ol
niN department, which has done an ex
c client job in challenging iun intellectual
thinking, nor with the direction ol the
I diversity, which used to stand for the
perhaps outdated ideal ol providing .in
intellectually rich, diverse and exciting
environment that I still uphold.
