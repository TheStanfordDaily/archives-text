Robinson warns that unless the bombing
stops soon so that food deliveries can get
through, seven million people could dieot
starvation this winter.
In am case, dropping 2()()0-pound
bombs near cities, along with cluster
bombs that spew shrapnel over an area the
si/e of 20 football fields, makes it certain
that civilians will sutler no matter how
benevolent 0111 intentions are.

c eptable substitute for the present Afghan
government even if the I aliban are de

lords of the Northern Alliance.
So supporters of the bombing should
ask themselves how many innocent peo
ple. inc hiding children, we should be will
ing to burn, cut to pieces with shrapnel, or
let starve to death in order to kill one man
and his elusive c ult members, even though
that would not eliminate terrorism. All

Peikoff fails to understand Iran
I lived in Iran during a tumultuous
lime: the 1970 Iranian revolution and the
war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It was a
time in w Inch a red rose within a blooming
garden wasn't red anymore, for there was
no one to enjo\ it. It was a confusing lime
in which happiness and well-being were
lost within the maelstrom of war. It was a
time in which the usual modes of life were
siipei seded by the struggle for survival.
I he 1070 Iranian revolution brought
about sudden change, in which a country
disenchanted by a corrupt. Western
struck autocracy was led to believe
through media and print technologies
that .i peaceful exile would bring true
democracy and freedom to the peo pie,
which never happened. Approximately
one and a half years later, Iraq, led by the
infamous Saddam Hussein, decided to

ovei take .1 \ ulnerable nation.
I hinkiug that bombs and air raids
would make Iran dot ile, Iraq set out fora
struggle which would inadvertenth cost
main innocent people their lives. 1 lie
irom is that Iraq, like Iran, is religiously
affiliated with Islam. Wh\ would.l Muslim
countn turn on another following the
same rules and regulations, pra\ ing to the
same (loci. - ' At the end of the prayer, a true
Muslim asks lot the well being of every
human being in the world. Surprisingly,
this wat brought death to thousands of in
noccut people. ()i mavbe this isn't so sur
prising, seeing .is how religion has always
been au effective outlet for politic i/ation
and subsequent conflict.
In order to survive the war or retreat
from a revolution turned sour, many Ira
nians came to the United States, in the
hopes of encountering opportunities and
contributing their vast knowledge and ex
perience to a new society. Their children
would eventually grow up in a society
where opportunities exist for people of
every race and color, where the freedom
to think and speak as an individual is not
seen as blasphemy.
et not a cla\ goes by th.it they remem
ber those who stayed back in Iran, every
now and then reminding themselves that
its going to start getting better soon: the
state of Iran is progressing, as it is more
democratic by American standards now
than it has ever been. But the light of hope
about reuniting the entire Iranian com
munity grows dimmer each day, as it
probably does for most American ethnic
groups.
In light Sept. 11, the United States
waged a war against "terror." It is clear
that the enemy has many faces, hence this
war may inevitably extend to other fronts.
