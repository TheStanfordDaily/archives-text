FIELD HOCKEY
Saturday: No. 17 Califor
nia 1, No. 20 Stanford 0

Ask Delaware.
Both No. 17 (lalifornia (KM,
5-1 Norl'ar) .Hid No. 20 Stan
ford ( ( .>-7,5-1) knew thai a lot was
riding on Saturday's BigCiame,
and the\ played a< eordingly.
Although ( aland Stanford
will share the regular season
Noii'at title, their Norl'ai
tournament seedings were de
cided by the Delaware Bine
I lens, \\ ho do not even play in
the Norl'.u . hut in the Atnerita
Fast ('.onferem e.
In the game on Saturday,
(la I finally ended the pro
tracted struggle on standout
sophomore midfielder Nora
Feddersen's unassisted goal
with II minutes 17 seconds
remaining in the second
overtime, winning 1 -0 .
This is where the Blue Hens

step in.
Sinee both ( .il and Stanford
ended up lin the \oi Pac. the
number one seed for the tourna
ment was determined by
tiebreakers.
Ihe first tiebreaker — goal
tall\ in head-to-head mate Imps
— didn't solve the problem.
Stanford defeated ( al I -Oeai lier
in the month, so the season talh
was tied at one goal per team.
I lie next determining factor
for playofl seeding is record ver
sus non-conference opponents.
Both teams lost to Maryland ((.al
8-0, Stanford 1-1), and both
clubs defeated l airfield ((..il H-2,
Stanford 3-0). I lie Hears,
though, defeated Delaware 2-1,
while the Cardinal lost to the
Blue Hens 1-0, giving Cal the
No. 1 seed.
Fittingly. Stanford and (.al
will probabh meet in the Nor Pac
Conference 1 oui nainent, and
that game will probably be as
competitive as Saturday's.
Both squads showed their
defensive resiliency from start
to finish Stanford maintained
control for most of the game,
pressuring the Golden Bears
.iiid threatening ( ;il goalkeep
er Kmily Rowlen.
(Cardinal junior midfielder
I.i/ On attempted a penalt\
stroke with 24:47 left in the
first hall. However, Rowlen
dove to her light just in time to
make a bod\ save.
Through the course of the
game, the Cardinal would appar
ently score three times — and have
all three of the goals disallowed In
the officials.
"We're still trying to figure it

out," said senior forward Erica
Swesey.
In tlie sevcn-on-seven overtime
periods, (lal made its move as Kcd
tlersen lofied the game-winning
goal over senior Cardinal goal
keeper Rebecca Shapiro.
Stanford will look to atone for
this loss w hen the \oi I'at (.onler
ence I ournanient begins this
I hurstla) in Boone, North ( aroli
na. Ihe Cardinal, seeded second
in its bracket, will pla\ third-seed
Radford (6-12. 3-3).
"What really matters is the tour
nament," Swesey said. "We will
avenge this loss"
