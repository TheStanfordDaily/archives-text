### JENNIFER GRAHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lilt' College Board released .1 survey last
week showing that the gap between rising col
lege eosts and the rate of nidation has contin
ued to increase.
With the econotm weakening, especialb
atlei the terrorist .nta< ks ol Sept. 1 1. the surg
ing tost ol higher education raises questions
about the diet t the surging cost ol'higher edu
cation will have on Stanford admissions and the
student both.
However, administrators remain confident
that the st hoofs need-blind admissions polit \ and
commitment to financial aid will prevent am fun
damental changes in the undergraduate popula
tion of the I 'niversitv.
For the 2001-02 vcar, the College Board re
ported that tuition and ices at private, four-year
colleges i t)se .">.5 pert ent and that the tost ol living
on campus rose 1.7 percent.
Last Februarv, the Board ol I rustees an
nounced an increase in the overall tost of tu
ition. room and hoard rales at Stanford of :Y I
percent from the 2000-01 to the 2001-02 vcar.
I hose involved in setting the tuition lor Stan
ford said it is too carl\ to speculate on the rate of
increase in tuition and fees for the 2002-011 vear.

Budget ()fii( e, 1 ited two main fat tors 111 the de
cision to set tuition that the Board of I rustees
ultimately makes.
"()ne is the cost of providing <1 Stanford edu
cation, which is driven bv people costs — em
ploying outstanding fat ult v and staff in a very ex
pensive local labor market." he said. "Also, we
look at our relationship to other institutions in
terms of the program we provide here."
Warner explained that Stanford strives to en
sure it is providing the best undergraduate etlu-

Robin Mainlet, dean ol undei
graduate admissions and linani ial
aid, noted that there is a constant
struggle in setting tuition.
" Tuition covers onl\ a portion
of the cost to educate each Stan

lord student, and so the tension
always exists between what our
costs rcalh arc and how nun h to
i aise oui tuition, she said.
"Stanford's tuition is still lag

peers." she added.
Cenerallv, the total cost ol at
tending Stanford as an under
graduate is between $1,000 and
$2,000 less than that ol l\\

While a strained t'tonomv will

surel\ make it more difficult for
lamilies to dole out the more than
$.'*o,ooo annualh that it costs to
send an undergraduate to Stan
lord. admissions and budget offi
cials expressed confidence that
Stanford's financial aid program
will prevent economic woes from
posing a major problem.
"Roiighh 70 percent of our
students receive some kind of fi
nancial assistance, and just over
10 pet e cut are on Stanford need
based limine uil aid." Mamlet said.
"Stanford offers an exceptional li
mine i.il aid program, so that all
families will c ontinue to find Stan

lord within their reach.
"Because of this, we have his
torical had a sot io-econoinit alh
diverse student bodv, and we are
committed to maintaining this.
Need-based financial aid remains
among our highest priorities."
Warner explained that in the
past, when the economy has weak
ened. Stanford's financial aid pro
gram has not suffered. He cited
the importance of restricted
sources, such .is donations, for fi
nancial aid, and said such monies
have become an increasingh sub
stantial feature in the University's
ability to award scholarships re

gardlcss of the et nnomit c limate.
"I iliink financial aid is very at
trai ti\e to main donors, and sup
porting students and maintaining
the student bod\ is ver\ critical,"
he said.
"I think that as we look ahead
toward .1 tighter economic cli
mate, our financial aid program
will keep pace with families'
needs," W'arnei added. "1 don't
see much on the hori/on that is
going to prompt the I niversit) to
change what h.is been a ver\ suc
cessful and deeph held polk v."
Some students said the) un
derstood the University's need to
increase tuition levels, arguing
that it is important in maintaining
the quality of undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford.

However, some students do
not qualify for financial aid hut
still struggle to pa\ the annual
necessary costs. One such stu
dent. freshman Sara Weekly, said
slu- worries that tuition increases,
coupled with a deflated economy,
will force families like hers to feel
a hard pinch.
"It's really going to catch peo
ple like my family especially

hard because we're right at the
border of qualifying for financial
aid. but we don't get any," Week
ly said. "Because we're also the
group who is getting hit the
hardest by the tech bust and the
stock market decline, it's going
to make it especially hard to
compensate for those economic
losses and compensate for the es
calating tuition."
