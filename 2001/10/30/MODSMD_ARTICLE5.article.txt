### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND EDITORIAL STAFF 
112 ive students will read poems tonight
as part of the I iidergraduate Writing
Center's Celebration for I iidergraduate
Poetry. I lie event represents part of the
center's effort to increase campus focus
on writing.
"The aim of the writing center is to
support all sorts of writing," saitl Marvin
Diogenes, associate director of writing
and rhetoric. "Some workshops will help
with writing for courses while others will
show the range of writing produced by
undergraduates."
Sophomore Max Doty will emcee the
ceremony, and juniors Mike Pappas, Blv
Pope and /at hary Beer as well as sopho
more Kllen Freytag will read original
poems in addition to one favorite.
"Poetry is my sport, and this is my
game day," saitl Pappas, who has un
officially titled his portion of the pro
gram "Coyote." "1 plan on eating a lot
of carbohydrates antl getting a gootl
night's sleep."
Freytag saitl she is simply excited to

read her poems aloud and that hearing a
poem "really brings it to life."
"It's so important to have a reading
where poems can be read out loud. It's
really a different experience from lead
ing them on the page." she said.
Beer echoed Freytag's enthusiasm.
"Poetry is just as much an oral art .is it is
a written art." he said. "It's such an im
portant aspect of poetry."
However Doty admitted that he is "a
little nervous about reading (hisJ poems."
Still, the master of ceremonies retains
an open mind about the reading. "I think
one word describes my performance,
and that is spontaneity." Doty said.
fhe reading will begin at 7 p.m. in
room 020 of Margaret Jacks 11.ill. Each
student will read for 10 minutes, and a
30-minute open microphone session
will follow.
"There's so much great writing on this
campus, not just by the Stegner Fellows,"
said Gaby Calvocoressi, a second-year
Stegner Fellow. "It'll be great for under
graduates to start responding to other
undergraduates in this type of setting."
Pappas agreed. "It's always nice to

have student readings and hear the
work <>l my contemporaries,"' he said.
"And besides, there's always a chance
that one of the poet's reading will be
come .1 I'oet Laureate, and I can sa\ I
knew them then.' "
I he I 'nder"graduate Writing ( enter
opened ()<t. 15, but will celebrate its
grand opening in a ceremom Nov. (">.
"The bottom line is that we want to
help students become better writers,"
Diogenes sai(l. "Writing is so central to
work at a university and beyond. Ihe
more we can do to support the develop
ment of writers the better."
Calvocoressi said that depending on
the success of this reading, the- center will
likely organize future readings.
"I'd love to hear a fiction or non-fic
tion reading," she said. "We want to c re
ate more of a writing community and
have students approach us and sa\ 'I
want to read.' "
" I he writing c ommunity will only be
.is successful as the undergraduates
make it," C'.alvoc oressi added. "It could
really be something meaningful to this
campus."
