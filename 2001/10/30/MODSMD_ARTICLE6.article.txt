ment among students, Stanford in (â€¢( >vern
nient's Campus Awareness Committee is
sponsoring Coffee Hours at the Collet*
1 louse. I lie events are meant to offer stu
dents an informal setting where they tan
meet antl discuss politics.
"We figured the Ix-st way to increase
campus awareness is to bring people to
gether It) talk alxnit |issues] in a less formal
setting," said sophomore Alex Robbins, a
mcnilxT ofthe Sl( i committee.
R( >bbins described thecoflec hours as an
"impromptu dinner conversation" where
no particular group or icleolog\ dominates
the conversation.
lo initiate the dialogue, Sl(. memlxTs
pick an article to discuss, hut thc\ allow the
conversation lo flow in any tlircition. Rob

bins explained that members of the com
mittee will observe which issues spark the
most debate and tr\ to t boose the art it les
accordingly.
"Articles are just conversation starters,"
said sophomore Noah Popp, the commit
tee's co-director. "Probably a lot ol tliecon
versations in the next couple of weeks will
lot us on Sept. 1 1. but hopelulh we can talk
alxnit other things too."
Robbins saitl the coffee hours will be
espet iallv relevant to "people who are in
terested in c ampus politics but are not
inclined to go to large, set-up events and
face the opinion of people who set the
thing up."

Wednesday. I hough onk a handful of
people showed up, Popp said that the event
