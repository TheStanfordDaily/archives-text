In addition, the program aims "to give Stan

the opportunit\ to teach motivated students
and to increase contact between Stanford stu

FSP was founded at Stanford in 1990 by a
Stanford graduate student who had participat
ed in Ml Is KSP as an undergraduate.
Stanford's current program is modeled
aftc*i the Mil program, which has existed
since 1957.
In the past. SHF.P has been verv successful.

Ac cording to (lederberg.
"1 believe that our largest SHF.P was in the
1998-99 school vear, when between 300 and 400
| high sc hool| students participated," he said.
Foi the past two years, however, SHF.P has
struggled.
" I wo vears ago the program was much
smaller than we would like and last vear we did
not run it," Ceclerbeig said. " I his year we ex
pect the most successful SHF.P of the last few
veai s, since we have a dedicated new group of
administrators and are making earlier and
more organi/cd eflorts at student recruitment."
I Iwa said he expects this year's SI IFP to in
clude high school students from all over the
communities sin rounding Stanford.
"FSP is stepping up student recruitment cl

FSP Student Recruitment Coordinator
Jeramie Scott, .i junior, said, " I his year the stu

Most of the teachers in SI IF.P are Stanford
students; the community members who volun

versitv. Both must complete .in application
process to become teachers.
"In applications and interviews, we look for
people who have a definite plan of what au
ric ultim then c lass will cover and a c lear logisti
cal design loi how their class will run," said
sophomore Melanie Wong, FSP teacher re
