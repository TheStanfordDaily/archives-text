l.ditoi \ Xote: This story is the sec
ond in a three-part series of features
on the dass presidents. Today, we
prof ile the leaders of the junior ( '.lass
0f2003.
I wo vcars ago. Neeraj ( han
dra was a student at the I niver
sity <>112 Pennsylvania, and he
happened to make Iriends with
someone who was Rajaie
"Wedge" Batniji's best friend
from high school.
When Chandra transferred
to Stanford, he met Batniji, and
the two became fast friends.
I'll rough Batniji, lie met Anna
()tieno and |ordan (lonnors.
Fast forward to this year: the
four are now the junior class
presidents.
I hey say their focus for this
veai is on ( lass unity.
" | unior year is the time when
people are mosi disconnected
â€” so many people are abroad
or being residence staff that
there's not much unity," Chan
dra said. "()ur goal is to bridge
this gap and have constant com
munication going on."
I o start the year off on the
right note, the junior class
presidents hosted a club night
event at the Icon Club last
month, with about 200 juniors
in attendance.
I he presidents will also plan
the annual Junior Formal,
which will be held at the end of
winter quarter or at the begin

ning of spring quarter.
In addition, the junior (lass
presidents are planning "wel
come bat k" parties at the begin
ning of wintei and spring quar
ters for returning juniors who
have been abroad.
For the first time, the junior
class presidents are also plan
ning a Junior Class Field Da\
for the spring quarter.
"We'll get food from In-N-
Ont or some other plate and
just plav football and have Slip
'11' Slide," Chandra s.iid. "It'll be
lots of fun .ind also give people
a chance to relax."
Another lot us for ibis year's
junior presidents will be acade
mic and career resources.
"Junior year is a crossroads
when people start thinking seri
ously about Jilt- after Stanford."
Chandra said. " I here are so
many great resources here, but
a lot of people never use them
because they don't know how."
I'he junior presidents arc
also organizing a large alumni
dinner for winter quarter where
alumni from a variety of back
grounds who are now in invest
ment banking, medicine, law
and other areas will meet about
200 juniors in a formal setting.
ASSU President Matt Brew
er said lie admires the junior
presidents, saying, "I've been
privileged to have gotten the
opportunity to work with them
before, and I have a great deal
of respect for them and for
what tliev can do."
