### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Pentagon confirmed the presence
of American troops in northern
Afghanistan for the liist time yes
terday and credited them with im
proving the effectiveness of I S.
bombing raids.
Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld, who previously had re
fused to disclose such details, tolda
Pentagon news conference a "very
modest" number of U.S. troops
are advising forces opposed to the
Taliban, coordinating resupply
and helping direct I S. airstrikes
on Taliban targets.
Rumsfeld did not say which
U.S. troops are in Afghanistan or
how long they have been there,
but from his description of their
missions it seemed likely they in
clude Army Spec ial Forces, com
monly called Green Berets. I Ic
said fewer than 100 are in
Afghanistan.
A reporter at the press confer

ence quoted ( l it ic s who have called
the U.S. military effort in
Afghanistan halfhearted and mis
guided in its reluctance to commit
ground troops.
"We do have a very modest
number of ground troops in the
country," Rumsfeld said. "They
are there for liaison put poses and
have been doing an excellent job of
assisting with the coordination for
resupply of various types, as well as
targeting."
I le said President Bush has not
ruled out committing ground
troops in numbers comparable to
the 1991 Gulf War, when hun
dreds of thousands were deployed.
I lie Bush administration has
come under increasing critic ism in
recent clays for not doing more to
destroy the Taliban militia and as
sist the loose alliance of opposition
forces in the north. I hat alliance,
with modest I S. help, is hoping to
win control of the crossroads city of

Mazar-e-Sharif.
Rumsfeld insisted the United
States is making a strong effort to
help opposition forces, but he said
it was impossible to know when
their leaders might decide to ad
vance on Kabul or other key cities.
"We are doing what we can to
see that they have the kind of am
munition they need and the food
supplies they need, and we're
doing what we can to assist with
targeting some of the forces that
oppose them," he said. "But in the
last analysis, they are their own
forces, and they'll make those
judgments themselves."
