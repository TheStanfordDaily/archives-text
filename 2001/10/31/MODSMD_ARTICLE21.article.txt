Defining 'terrorism'
I n the ()t t. 'J9 "I el let's to Ihe f.ditor"
set lion t»I Ihe Daily. Stephen \ll Britle
argues that "Anient.in in il ita t \ ails
arc verv tlillerenl from "those deemed
as terrorist .it is b\ the Amerit an pub
lit ." bet a use "most st holai s tonsitlei ter
rorist at is as those perpetrated l>\ indi
viduals while at is ol war are those pel pe
ll.ited b\ stales."
I le seems lo imply thai be agrees that
the tinK dillercncc between the American
w.i i It >r<ls and the pel pel rat 01 sol the Sept.
I I attacks was one ol st ale, and that the
two are at t u.ill\ kindred in theii inclina
tions to use violent e as a means to settle
scores or to t rcatc newer < uies.
Maybe he and similar souls educated
about the perils ol military adventurism
should consider joining a campus peace
group or learn not lo speak their subt ou
st ions minds in public.

I he ASM and I both informed all of
the comedians as to (lie purpose of the
event. I he .ASSI also asked t lie comedians
not to talk about the events of Sept. 11. In
addition, I let the comics know that from
m\ experience, comedians who have done

jokes about Sept. II ncvei receive positive
leedb.it k from the audient c (i.e. laughter).

Alum says texts themselves not enough
I he Deans of Religions Life have re
cently weighed in on the debate in these
pages about the role of religion and scrip
ture in recent tragic events. I heir implica
tion is that if we "examine the texts of reli
gious communities in the company of
those who can thoughtfully convey their
religious meaning, cultural context and
interpretive traditions," everything would

(aim <low ii.
Apparently if we jiiM put ourselves in
the care <>l those with appropriate theo
logical credentials, we would he sale.
I herelore, we should siillc debate on this
topic, including presnniahK m\ letter in
these pages a lew issues hat k. and leave the
mallei to the professionals. With .ill due
respec I to the deans, this position is intel
lectualb la/\ .il l)csi and in fact does noth
ing to make »i•> s.ilc from those who use re
ligion to |iisiil\ violence.
I could cite centuries of brutal sup
pression <>l intellectual inquiry and re
ligious diffcrenc e ordered bv individu
als wit h impet ( able Iheological creden
tials. bui w ill instead limit myself to re
cent hist()i\ and current events. I lind
most positions advocated bv Mcir ka
hane, |err\ I alwell, Avatollah Khomei
ni and Mullah ()mat , to name a few, ut
lerl\ repugnant.
\i the same time, these individuals can
put loiih logicall\ sound arguments for
these religious excesses based on their
scriptural traditions, finally, in their re
spec live traditions, the theological ( reden
lials of these individuals are as impeccable
as those ol the witch hunters and inc|iiisi
lors w ho preceded llieni — and certainly
as impec c able as am ol the Deans of Reli
gious I .ile.
I he answer is not whether Islam is / is
not about peace or that Falwell's attribu
tion ol the Sept. I I events to "America's
turningawa\ from (iod" is/ is not based in
scripture. In both eases, one can find a
time honored "interpretive tradition" to
support either alternative.
Ihe answers are complex and mi
anc ed, and we gain nothing bv surrender
ing oui light to think lor ourselves to
"prolessionals", am more than we should
allow ourselves to he siU'iu t'<l In (host* who

Student questions Singer's ethics
Ihursdax night 1 attended the "de
hale in the l.aw School on genet ii
shopping. I ihought it was sponsored h\
Stanlord. But the longer I staved the
more I thought I had blundered into
some (aricatin c ol Boh |oncs I niversit\.
Hie moderator, Hans (iomhrecht,
kit ked it (»ll (tu .i \er\ Boh |ones note
that no theologians were on the panel
.uid that we would "keep the Pope out
ol the room. I hat's the soil ol thing
got the president in trouble with
(at hoi its w hen he spoke at Bob |oncs.
But w lib (>od out ol the wa\, we loin id

evei ylxhln |>icii\ much agreed on tlie*
ethics dl ilu- parental pick-a-mix. Peter
Singeiol Princeton told us thai selecting
the Hails ol vour thildren and gelling rid
ol ilit' ones von don't like was no l)ig deal
.ind that comparisons between him and
llie Na/is were inapposite because \.i/is
advoiate killing retarded and disabled in
lants in ordei lo puril\ the master rate,
.nul Singei .ulvocates killing retarded and
disabled inlants when the parents don't
want to de.il.
I lie polite attention and applause
given to Singei remains the most amaz
ing part ol the evening to me. I li.it and
the I.k i tli.it the panelists bought
Singei s I.k ile evasion ol the \.i/i argu
ment and gave this man a publit forum.
Singei is spreading evil, contemptible
lies about wli.it it means to be human.
And lie believes that sex between bu
rn.ms .mil.llliii l.ll s is moralh acceptable.
Don i believe lie s (hat bad? 11 ere s a
bit Iroin Singei's "Practical Imhies":
"Parents inav, with good reason, regret
tli.it ,i disabled (liild was ever born. In
tli.it event the el led th.it the death ol
the child will liaveon its parents (in be
.i reason loi. r.ithei than against killing
it. It nia\ still be objected that to re
plat e ei t lie i ,i let us or a new hoi n in la lit

is wrong, be( ause it suggests to disabled
people living today that their lives are
less worth living than the li\es of peo
ple who are not disabled. Yet it is sure
l\ 11 \ illg m the lace ol realit\ to den\
that, on average, this is so."
In another book he advocates a 28
da\, no-(|iiestions-asked warrant) on
babies. I hat one looks like the milk
man? Kill it. Send it back to its maker
and ti \ again.
C )h, "disability" st reu lies so lar as to
include hemopliilia but not, in Singer's
(bespectacled, short-sighted) world,
mvopia. I brow 1 lomer from (he train,
si nll Stephen 1 law king in a gunny sat k
and drown him in the liver; there's
more litilit\ all around with sprv, perk\
Pamela Anderson.
So: where were the liberals when we
needed them? |ust like at Hob |ones. the)
were now here to be seen. No one stood
outside in protest, no one asked Singer
tough (|iiestions, no one handed out livers
sa\ ing "l I lis man is a dangerous ijikk k."
No one in a wheelchair showed up to
keel-haul him across campus. Singer's
appointment to Princeton in 2000 was
louglit tooth and claw h\ concerned
parties Iroin across the political spec
trum and, he said, some "verv livelv"
