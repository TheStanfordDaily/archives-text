Defining 'terrorism'
I n the ()t t. 'J9 "I el let's to Ihe f.ditor"
set lion t»I Ihe Daily. Stephen \ll Britle
argues that "Anient.in in il ita t \ ails
arc verv tlillerenl from "those deemed
as terrorist .it is b\ the Amerit an pub
lit ." bet a use "most st holai s tonsitlei ter
rorist at is as those perpetrated l>\ indi
viduals while at is ol war are those pel pe
ll.ited b\ stales."
I le seems lo imply thai be agrees that
the tinK dillercncc between the American

I I attacks was one ol st ale, and that the
two are at t u.ill\ kindred in theii inclina
tions to use violent e as a means to settle
scores or to t rcatc newer < uies.
Maybe he and similar souls educated
about the perils ol military adventurism
should consider joining a campus peace
group or learn not lo speak their subt ou
st ions minds in public.

I he ASM and I both informed all of
the comedians as to (lie purpose of the
event. I he .ASSI also asked t lie comedians
not to talk about the events of Sept. 11. In
addition, I let the comics know that from
m\ experience, comedians who have done

jokes about Sept. II ncvei receive positive
leedb.it k from the audient c (i.e. laughter).

Alum says texts themselves not enough
I he Deans of Religions Life have re
cently weighed in on the debate in these
pages about the role of religion and scrip
ture in recent tragic events. I heir implica
tion is that if we "examine the texts of reli
gious communities in the company of
those who can thoughtfully convey their
religious meaning, cultural context and
interpretive traditions," everything would

(aim <low ii.
Apparently if we jiiM put ourselves in
the care <>l those with appropriate theo
logical credentials, we would he sale.
I herelore, we should siillc debate on this
topic, including presnniahK m\ letter in
these pages a lew issues hat k. and leave the
mallei to the professionals. With .ill due
respec I to the deans, this position is intel
lectualb la/\ .il l)csi and in fact does noth
ing to make »i•> s.ilc from those who use re
ligion to |iisiil\ violence.
I could cite centuries of brutal sup
pression <>l intellectual inquiry and re
ligious diffcrenc e ordered bv individu
als wit h impet ( able Iheological creden
tials. bui w ill instead limit myself to re
cent hist()i\ and current events. I lind
most positions advocated bv Mcir ka
hane, |err\ I alwell, Avatollah Khomei
ni and Mullah ()mat , to name a few, ut
lerl\ repugnant.
\i the same time, these individuals can
put loiih logicall\ sound arguments for
these religious excesses based on their
scriptural traditions, finally, in their re
spec live traditions, the theological ( reden
lials of these individuals are as impeccable
as those ol the witch hunters and inc|iiisi
lors w ho preceded llieni — and certainly
as impec c able as am ol the Deans of Reli
gious I .ile.
I he answer is not whether Islam is / is
not about peace or that Falwell's attribu
tion ol the Sept. I I events to "America's
turningawa\ from (iod" is/ is not based in
scripture. In both eases, one can find a
time honored "interpretive tradition" to
support either alternative.
Ihe answers are complex and mi
anc ed, and we gain nothing bv surrender
