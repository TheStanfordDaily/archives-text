## Parties, alcohol and hangovers — oh my! 
### JEN TAYLOR 
Q: As a rollcge student, 1 cxcasionally
like to partake in a couple of drinks. Who
ain I kidding? I woke up this morning with
a monster hangover, and I can barely re
member what went on last night. I'm actu
ally really starting to worry. What am I
doing to myself when I drink?
A: You know what? You should worry.
Messing around with alcohol can Ix* pretty
serious when you don't know how it is al
iening your body. Keeping that disc laimer
in mind, I'm going to explain how alcohol
works, details what causes a hangover and
suggest how to avoid the slings and arrows
of alcohol.
In case you didn't know, alcohol is a
drug, and effects vary from person to per
son. The alcohol found in alcoholic lx*v
erages is ethyl alcohol (ethanol). For all
you pre-nieds, its molecular structure
looks like this:
II
H3-C-C-OH
II
I lowever, you won't find pure ethanol
iti chinks because it is much deadlier —

and evaporates very cjuickly — in pure
form. For example, ethanol concentration
(by volume) fora beer is 4.5 percent, wine
is 15 percent and rum is about 50 percent.
When you drink an alcoholic beverage,
20 percent ol the alcohol is absorbed in the
stomach and 80 percent is absorbed in the
small intestine. The amount of time it takes
to absorb the alcohol depends on several
factors: the concentration of alcohol in the
beverage (the greater the concentration,
the faster the absorption); the type of drink
(carbonated leverages tend to speed up
the absorption of alcohol); and whether
the stomach is full or empty (fcxxl slows
down alcohol absorption).
After absorption, alcohol enters the
bloodstream and dissolves in the blcxxl.
Blcxkl carries the alcohol throughout the
body. Hie alcohol from the blcxxl then en
ters and dissolves in the water inside each
tissue of the Ixxly — except in fat tissue, as
alcohol cannot dissolve in fat. Once inside
tissues, alcohol exerts its effects on the Ixxly.
I he observed effects depend directly on the
blcxxl alcohol concentration, which is relat
ed to the amount of alcohol consumed. Ilie
BAC can rise significantly wit bin 20 minutes
after having a drink.
Once absorbed by the blcxxlstream. the

alcohol leaves the body in three ways: the
kidney eliminates five percent of alcohol in
the urine; the lungs exhale five percent of
alcohol, which can be detec ted by breatha
lyzer devices; and the liver chemically
breaks down the remaining alcohol into
acetic acid.
As a rule of thumb, an average person
can eliminate 0.5 ounces (15 milliliters) of
alcohol per hour. So. it would take ap
proximately one hour to eliminate the al
cohol from a 12 oz (355 mL) can of beer.
BAG increases when the body absorbs al
cohol faster than it can eliminate it. Be
cause the body tan only eliminate about
one dose of alcohol per hour, consuming
several drinks in an hour will increase your
BAG much more rapidly.
The breakdown, or oxidation, of
ethanol occurs in the liver. An enzyme in
the liver called alcohol dehydrogenase
strips electrons from ethanol to form ac
etaldehyde. Another enzyme, called alde
hyde dehydrogenase, converts the ac
etaldehyde to acetic acid, the main compo
nent in vinegar, in the presence of oxygen.
The molecular structure of acetic acid
l(K)ks like this: C)
II
HSC-C-O-H

The | | symbol is a double bond be
tween the atoms. When ethanol is oxi
dized to acetic acid, two protons and two
electrons are also produced. I hc acetic
acid can be used to form fatty acids, or can
be further broken down into carbon diox
ide and water.
The hangover that you are experienc
ing in the morning is a result of several liic -
tors. One of these is dehydration. ITiis is be
cause alcohol is a diuretic, a drug that in
creases urination and flushes fluids from
the body. Drinking codec the next morn
ing only increases this problem as coffee is
also a diuretic. Another factor is the pres
ence of mild poisons in the alcoholic drink.
Complex organic molecules such as
methanol and acetone are found in some
drinks and are said to Ix* responsible lor
hangovers rather than ethanol (alcohol).
One strong supporter of t his view is re
searcher Dr. Lan Galder of the London
based National I lospital lot Neurosurgery.
Alcohol type also contributes to hangovers.
Brandy, then red wine, rum and whisky
ate worst for hangovers. White wine, gin
and vodka are less inclined to incite a nasty
hangover. In fact, the British Medical Jour
nal did tests that showed chinking bourbon
whiskey is twice as likely to cause a hang

over than the same <1111011111 ol vodka.
()f course, too mm h alcohol also causes
hangovers. 100 much alcohol depletes the
body of necessary substances — including
blood sugar, vitamins and minerals — re
quired to stay healthy. Kven worse is too
much bad alcohol. Bad wine — that is, a
bad harvest — may include more sub
stances that cause hangovers. Kven drink
ing insullicientK aged can Ik- harmful. Al
most all red wines and cliardonnay are
matured in oak barrels so that they will
keep and improve. II you drink this wine
younger than three years, there will lx* a
higher level of nasties that can cause hang
overs. If left to mature, these nasties
change to neutral substances and don't
cause hangovers. C ienerally, wine stored in
oak bairels for six months should be ac
ceptable to drink within the first year.
1 n order to minimize the symptoms of
a hangover, you want to eat plenty of
food and drink plenty of water. Contin
ue to eat food the next morning, and if
you can manage it, get some exercise and
sweat it out.
Most importantly, know your limits.
Avoid the hangover situation altogether.
Drink just enough to remain in the "so
cial /.one"!

is 15 percent and rum is about 50 percent.
When you drink an alcoholic beverage,
20 percent ol the alcohol is absorbed in the
stomach and 80 percent is absorbed in the
small intestine. The amount of time it takes
to absorb the alcohol depends on several
factors: the concentration of alcohol in the
beverage (the greater the concentration,
the faster the absorption); the type of drink
(carbonated leverages tend to speed up
the absorption of alcohol); and whether
the stomach is full or empty (fcxxl slows
down alcohol absorption).
After absorption, alcohol enters the
bloodstream and dissolves in the blcxxl.
Blcxkl carries the alcohol throughout the
body. Hie alcohol from the blcxxl then en
ters and dissolves in the water inside each
tissue of the Ixxly — except in fat tissue, as
alcohol cannot dissolve in fat. Once inside
tissues, alcohol exerts its effects on the Ixxly.
I he observed effects depend directly on the
blcxxl alcohol concentration, which is relat
ed to the amount of alcohol consumed. Ilie
BAC can rise significantly wit bin 20 minutes
after having a drink.
Once absorbed by the blcxxlstream. the

alcohol leaves the body in three ways: the
kidney eliminates five percent of alcohol in
the urine; the lungs exhale five percent of
alcohol, which can be detec ted by breatha
lyzer devices; and the liver chemically
breaks down the remaining alcohol into
acetic acid.
As a rule of thumb, an average person
can eliminate 0.5 ounces (15 milliliters) of
alcohol per hour. So. it would take ap
proximately one hour to eliminate the al
cohol from a 12 oz (355 mL) can of beer.
BAG increases when the body absorbs al
cohol faster than it can eliminate it. Be
cause the body tan only eliminate about
one dose of alcohol per hour, consuming
several drinks in an hour will increase your
BAG much more rapidly.
The breakdown, or oxidation, of
ethanol occurs in the liver. An enzyme in
the liver called alcohol dehydrogenase
strips electrons from ethanol to form ac
etaldehyde. Another enzyme, called alde
hyde dehydrogenase, converts the ac
etaldehyde to acetic acid, the main compo
nent in vinegar, in the presence of oxygen.

The hangover that you are experienc
ing in the morning is a result of several liic -
tors. One of these is dehydration. ITiis is be
cause alcohol is a diuretic, a drug that in
creases urination and flushes fluids from
the body. Drinking codec the next morn
ing only increases this problem as coffee is
also a diuretic. Another factor is the pres
ence of mild poisons in the alcoholic drink.
Complex organic molecules such as
methanol and acetone are found in some
drinks and are said to Ix* responsible lor
hangovers rather than ethanol (alcohol).
One strong supporter of t his view is re
searcher Dr. Lan Galder of the London
based National I lospital lot Neurosurgery.
Alcohol type also contributes to hangovers.
Brandy, then red wine, rum and whisky
ate worst for hangovers. White wine, gin
and vodka are less inclined to incite a nasty
hangover. In fact, the British Medical Jour
nal did tests that showed chinking bourbon
whiskey is twice as likely to cause a hang

over than the same <1111011111 ol vodka.
()f course, too mm h alcohol also causes
hangovers. 100 much alcohol depletes the
body of necessary substances — including
blood sugar, vitamins and minerals — re
quired to stay healthy. Kven worse is too
much bad alcohol. Bad wine — that is, a
bad harvest — may include more sub
stances that cause hangovers. Kven drink
ing insullicientK aged can Ik- harmful. Al
most all red wines and cliardonnay are
matured in oak barrels so that they will
keep and improve. II you drink this wine
younger than three years, there will lx* a
higher level of nasties that can cause hang
overs. If left to mature, these nasties
change to neutral substances and don't
cause hangovers. C ienerally, wine stored in
oak bairels for six months should be ac
ceptable to drink within the first year.
1 n order to minimize the symptoms of
a hangover, you want to eat plenty of
food and drink plenty of water. Contin
ue to eat food the next morning, and if
you can manage it, get some exercise and
sweat it out.
Most importantly, know your limits.
Avoid the hangover situation altogether.

Q: As a rollcge student, 1 cxcasionally
like to partake in a couple of drinks. Who
ain I kidding? I woke up this morning with
a monster hangover, and I can barely re
member what went on last night. I'm actu
ally really starting to worry. What am I
doing to myself when I drink?
A: You know what? You should worry.
Messing around with alcohol can Ix* pretty
serious when you don't know how it is al
iening your body. Keeping that disc laimer
in mind, I'm going to explain how alcohol
works, details what causes a hangover and
suggest how to avoid the slings and arrows
of alcohol.
In case you didn't know, alcohol is a
drug, and effects vary from person to per
son. The alcohol found in alcoholic lx*v
erages is ethyl alcohol (ethanol). For all
you pre-nieds, its molecular structure
looks like this:

H3-C-C-OH

I lowever, you won't find pure ethanol
iti chinks because it is much deadlier —

and evaporates very cjuickly — in pure
form. For example, ethanol concentration
(by volume) fora beer is 4.5 percent, wine
is 15 percent and rum is about 50 percent.
When you drink an alcoholic beverage,
20 percent ol the alcohol is absorbed in the
