## Dreaming of a 6-0 record and a No. 1 ranking A
						few less mistakes vs. WSU and Stanford just might lead the BCS 
### 
Willi last week's win
over I ( LV the Stan
ford football team has
now risen to sixth
place in the BCS standings and
10th in the A!' poll. These rank
ings showcase the ('.animal's ab
solute!) ama/ingstart.
Fora team that entered the sea
son imranked, what our football
team b;is done in its first si\ games
has not only been unexpec led, but
downright spectacular. After heal
ing two lop-five teams in c< msec u
tive weeks, the C.ardinal lias now
compiled .i 5-1 record against op
ponents making up .i strength of
s< hedule thai ranks,is the most dif
ficult in the nation.
Now, tb.it being said, I feel an
uncontrollable urge to bring up
probably the single most vexing
"what if imaginable. What if we
had beaten Washington Stale?
Where would we be n< >w ?
Before going any further, I
want to st.ite wholcheartedh that
this in no way is meant totakeawa\
anything from the football team's
remarkable achievements so far
ibis season. But still, 1 can't tesisi
bringing up the scenario that
everyone is no doubt imagining.
What if we bad beaten W ash
ington State three weekends ago
in a game that, regardless of the
final score, showed Stanford to be
tlit* superior team to all those in
attendance?
1 will tell you the answer, as un
fathomable as it may seem.
We would be the No. 1 team in
the country, atop the BCS stand
ings and in pei fee t position to play
in the National Championship
game come January. With an un
defeated record, the lop strength
of schedule (as opposed to Nebras
ka's eighth ranked SOS and
Miami's 7bth ranked SOS), the
subsequent top spot in the com
puter polls and an A!' ranking that
would probably be somewhere be

tween fourth and sixth, the ( ardi
nal would be poised lor an oppor
tunity to win its first national title
sine e 1926.
Now I know what anyone
reading this is thinking: there's
no way to know whether we
would have beaten either ()rcgon
or I CI .Ait we hadn't lost to the
Cougars on (hat fateful home
coming Saturda\.
As the\ sa\ in ni\ political sci
ence i lass, there are just too main
confounding variables to even
make a prediction. With I'asani
hurt and Lewis stepping in, so
inuc li has happened in the last two
weeks that it ina\ seem too fal
len bed to imagine this hvpotheli
cal situation.
But try, just for the hell of it.
\t a sc liool so dominant in
sports all across the board, from
tennis to baseball to watei polo,
people have bee onie so blase about
being ranked in the top-five and
winning national championships
thai it's ridiculous.
I Ins none balance, howe\er,
has never spread to the realm of
football, foi bet lei or foi woi sc. Al
though the Cardinal lias been a
consistent In good team for
decades, appearing in the Rose
Bowl I I times, it has not been the
powerhouse that the Stanford
community has become .u<us
toined to seeing in other areas of
the athletic department.
Mavbe that is the reason win
there seems to be such a taboo
against bringing up the Washing
ton State game, the idea being we
should just be happy, and right
fully* impressed, with the team's
5-1 record.
But I don't think that's fair I
think the football team is belter
than thai and I think ilicv think it
too. As quarterback Chris l.ewis
told reporters after Saturclav s
game, "We led that we're as good
as anybody in the country. II we
play well, we can put up points
with the best of them.'
In that game against Washing
lon Slate on ()(tobei Lt, Stanford
