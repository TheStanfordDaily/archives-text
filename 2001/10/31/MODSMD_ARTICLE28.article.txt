# Field hockey says goodbye to five seniors
## 
### MARK THOMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If they formed a pop musit
group, they might be failed "S
club 5."
I'he five seniors on this vear's
1 7th-ranked ('.ardinal field hot k
ey team, defenders Sara I lei man.
Melita Sawyer and Melissa Slai,
goalkeeper Rehet t a Shapiro and
forward Krica Swesey, have a lot
in common. Not only tit) all of
them have either a first or last
name beginning with the letter
"s," but they also share a spirit of
camaraderie, teamwork and ath
letic excellence — as well as a his
tory of public performance on
and off the field.
"Freshman year, we had to
dress up in the airport and do
these crazy dances," Herman
said.
Although their collegiate ca
reers are winding to at lose, these
seniors are focused on a final
goal: reaching the NCAAs and
putting up a fight.
"It's not winding down, it's
reaching its peak," Swesey said.
However, a little nostalgia
can't be helped.
"It's really pretty strange,"
Shapiro said. "It seems to have
come to an end a little too quickly."
As time runs out, it becomes a
chance to make a final push for
unattained goals and to rt-flet t
back on goals achieved.
"I want to make it farther in
the NCAAs," Swesey said. "It's my
last chance."
"I wanted to be able to say that
I contributed to the team antl was

;i good leader," said Stai, who
along with Swesey is co-captain ol
this year's team.
"We just wanted to he taken
more seriously, and each year the
team's heen better and stronger,"
Sawyer said.
Regardless of how the postsea
son tintis out lor the Cardinal,
the five know they can count on
each other for support and
friendship.

"I've definitely made some of
the best friends I've ever had,"
I lennan said.
"It's fantastic," Sawyer
gushed. "It's just a bizarrely won
derful group of people."
I he team's t losencss as friends
is hugely a result of the many
hours spent together and the < ol
lectivc challenges they have all
been through in competition.
"I don't think you can get this

kind of friendship outside of
sports," Swesey said.
"We know when to have fun,
antl we know when to get serious
and it's great to be able to find
that balance," Shapiro saitl.
I he amity extends toand from
