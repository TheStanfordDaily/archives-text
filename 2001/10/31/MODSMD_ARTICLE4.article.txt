### RAVNEET KAUR 
I ho co-founder <>l Intel (orp.
donated .1 record-setting $000 mil
lion to the California Institute ol
Fechnology last week, saying he
wanted to promote greater cooper
ation between various disciplines
and keep the universit) ahead in sci
ence and technolog\ rcscan h.
Caltech will receive half of (>or
don Moore s donation over a span of
five years, which will come directly
from Moore and his wife, while the
couple's non-profit foundation will
provide tiie other half over 10 years.
Although many specifics have
yet to be negotiated, Caltech
president David Baltimore said
other possibilities for the funds
include biology projects to better
understand human conscious
ness and chemistry research on
more systematic met hods of mak
ing large molecules.
I lie universit)' also is looking .it
ways to strengthen its computer sci
ence offerings and develop a man
agement program to wed its s< ien
-11 tic prowess to areas ol finance and
economic s.
Although he has made dona
tions to other universities over the
years, Moore said he wanted to
locus his most significant invest
ment .it a single institution.
In fact, his is the latest in a series
of extraordinary donations to indi
vidual institutions of higher educa
tion in the I nited States.
Before Moore's donation, the

largest gift to a college or university
was the $400 million given to Stan
lord last Mav by the William and
Flora I fewlett Foundation.
According to Economics Prof.
I iinothy Bresnahan, "Scientist
entrepreneurs like Cordon
Moore and engineer-entrepre
neurs like Bill I lewlett tend to re
member the universities that
helped them get started."
"(iordon Moore is convinced ol
the value ol building companies and
industries for the long term, and of
the value of building new scientific
knowledge that will permit the
founding of new companies and in
dustries," Bresnahan added.

while such donations are highly
worthwbile investments, they c an
also be diflu nil to come by.
"Americ an colleges and universi

fundamental engines ol intellectual

progress in basic snout' and s* liol
arship," In- said.
"Scientific research is ex|>ensive,
and the universities [XTform thai
task in a somewhat uneasx partner
ship witli the federal government.
I he government feels it is con
tributing toward the cost ol re
search (It.it the universities want to
do, and so ii does not pay the lull
cost of the resean h," he continued.
A portion of the gift to (laltec h
will be used to enlarge its endow

billion, according to the C.altech
Web site.
I he string ol huge gifts, howev
er, may have more to do with the
stock market lx>om ol the HH)()s —
especially for technology entrepre

in patterns of giving to higher edu

"America has a long tradition
th.it individuals who accumulate a
great deal of wealth use that wealth
to do good," he said.
"People like David Packard and
Gordon Moore . . . understand
l)oili the value ol the educations
they received at Stanford and C.al

"That is why, even in these dif

step forward and contribute sig

belief in Americ a's lutiii e," Good

Noll said.
"We are living m an era in

"I also suspect that in the next

I ho co-founder <>l Intel (orp.
donated .1 record-setting $000 mil
lion to the California Institute ol
Fechnology last week, saying he
wanted to promote greater cooper
ation between various disciplines
and keep the universit) ahead in sci
ence and technolog\ rcscan h.
Caltech will receive half of (>or
don Moore s donation over a span of
five years, which will come directly
from Moore and his wife, while the
couple's non-profit foundation will
provide tiie other half over 10 years.
Although many specifics have
yet to be negotiated, Caltech
president David Baltimore said
other possibilities for the funds
include biology projects to better
understand human conscious
ness and chemistry research on
more systematic met hods of mak
ing large molecules.
I lie universit)' also is looking .it
ways to strengthen its computer sci
ence offerings and develop a man
agement program to wed its s< ien
-11 tic prowess to areas ol finance and
economic s.
Although he has made dona
tions to other universities over the
years, Moore said he wanted to
locus his most significant invest
ment .it a single institution.
In fact, his is the latest in a series
of extraordinary donations to indi
vidual institutions of higher educa
tion in the I nited States.
Before Moore's donation, the

largest gift to a college or university
was the $400 million given to Stan
lord last Mav by the William and
Flora I fewlett Foundation.
According to Economics Prof.
I iinothy Bresnahan, "Scientist
entrepreneurs like Cordon
Moore and engineer-entrepre
neurs like Bill I lewlett tend to re
member the universities that
helped them get started."
"(iordon Moore is convinced ol
the value ol building companies and
industries for the long term, and of
the value of building new scientific
knowledge that will permit the
founding of new companies and in
dustries," Bresnahan added.
Ac c circling to Dr. David (iood
stein. Vice Provost of ( alloc h.
while such donations are highly
worthwbile investments, they c an
also be diflu nil to come by.
"Americ an colleges and universi
ties are the crown jewels of our edu
cational s\ stem, but the\ are also the
fundamental engines ol intellectual

progress in basic snout' and s* liol
arship," In- said.
"Scientific research is ex|>ensive,
and the universities [XTform thai
task in a somewhat uneasx partner
ship witli the federal government.
I he government feels it is con
tributing toward the cost ol re
search (It.it the universities want to
do, and so ii does not pay the lull
cost of the resean h," he continued.
A portion of the gift to (laltec h
will be used to enlarge its endow
ment, which is currently at $1.2
billion, according to the C.altech
Web site.
I he string ol huge gifts, howev
er, may have more to do with the
stock market lx>om ol the HH)()s —
especially for technology entrepre
neurs — than with any real change
in patterns of giving to higher edu
cation, C ioodstein said.
"America has a long tradition
th.it individuals who accumulate a
great deal of wealth use that wealth
to do good," he said.
"People like David Packard and
Gordon Moore . . . understand
l)oili the value ol the educations
they received at Stanford and C.al
lech and the iinp<utanccofthc>se in
stitutions to out intellectual and
economic future," he said.
