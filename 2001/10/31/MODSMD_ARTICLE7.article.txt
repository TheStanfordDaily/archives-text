## 
### ANTHONY HA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I his fall, Stanford's Depart
ment of Athletic s. Phvsic al F.cluca
tion and Recreation is offering a
hip-hop class for the first time,
and instructors have been over
whelmed by student enrollment
numbering in the hundreds.
1 hec lass, which rcquircsaSM)
registration fee and is held in the
Roblc (iym basketball court, was
initially scheduled to meet I lies
days and I bin sdays at 4:1 f> p.m.
However, because far more stu
dents attended the first session
than initially projected, a second
section has been added at 3:15
p.m. on the same days.
junior Amy W illis, a student
enrolled in the hip-hop class, said
the c lass provides a fresh take on
physical education.
"I 'd already taken a lot of other
things, like ja/.z dancing and kick
boxing, so I was looking for some
thing new," she said. "It's a really
cool and worthwhile class that
Stanford should keep doing."
I he course is described on its
Web site as "syncopated dance to

lilt' latest hip-hop lor cardiovas
cular fitness."
|unior Markell Lewis, who is
,ilso taking the ( lass, agreed that
the dass meshes dance and aero
bic exercise well.
" I here's a really high level of
energy," she said. "You're con
stantly moving. There is a basic
set of moves, so you don't spend a
lot o! time learning, but at the
same time the instructor brings a
lew new moves to each lesson, so
it doesn't get boring."
I he course instructor is
Andre Bobo, who also teaches a
multi-sport class at Stanford and
several fitness courses off-cam
pus. With 15 years of experience
in the aerobics industry, Hobo
was first contacted about teach
ing the course by Stanford
Health Improvement Coordina
tor Nanci Coniss.
Despite his initial hesitance,
he consented.
"I wasn't sure if Stanford was
ready fora hip-hop class," Hobo
said. "So I was really surprised
when, instead of the 20 to SO stu
dents we expected, 200 showed
up for the first day of class."
B( >lx)said a lack of structure and
formula makes tlie class unique.
"In hip-hop, you have to
relax," he explained. "Everybody
has their own flava,' their own
style, their own personality. As

long as you're on the right beat,
you're doing it right. It's not a
black thing, it's not a white thing,
it's a rhythm thing."
Despite the addition of a sec -
ond section, each (lass is still
roughly tw ice as large as original
ly planned.
Nonetheless, both Willis and
Lewis said that the crowd does
not bother them, although they
would prefer having fewer peo
ple in the class.
"It's do-able," Lewis said. "He
moves around a lot. And with that
many people, there's ;i lot of en
ergy. Its ,i lot ol fun, and you can
be really loud."
Bobo agreed that with the right
students, the large dass si/e does
not cause a substantial hindrance.
"As long as people are excited
and want to do it, then it's fun,"
he said.
"The only real problem is the
logistical aspect ol taking roll and
stuff. Other than that, everyone
is doing very well. I'm totally im
pressed.' he added.
According to Bobo, future
pi.ins include bringing in guest
instructors for variety. He has
agreed to teach the class for a t
least one more quarter.
