GRAD STUDENTS
valuable opportunity,
The Stanford Alumni Association is now accepting applications for the
Graduate Student Representative
to the Alumni Board of Directors
The Stanford Alumni Association is advised by a board of
twenty-six alumni members and eleven ex-officio representatives,
including one graduate and one undergraduate student rep, an
international delegate and four members of the Stanford Board
of Trustees. The SAA Board meets in January, May and
September and helps set the direction and policies of the
Association. The graduate rep will convey the needs and concerns
of the graduate student body to the Board, influencing the
relationship between the SAA and the Stanford graduate student
community. The 2-3 year term begins at the next Board of
Directors meeting, January 10-11, at the Frances C. Arrillaga
Alumni Center. (The May meeting will be held at Sierra Camp.)
Applications are available at the Alumni Center (326 Galvez
Street) or by email at rts@stanford.edu. For more information,
call the outgoing graduate student representative, Sonja Ho Uy,
at 3-1586, or Rene Spicer at the Alumni Association, 6-0467.
