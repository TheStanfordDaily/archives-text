1990
On Nov. 1, 1990, I lie Daily printed an edi
torial about the Band's suspension:
"With the Suspension of tlit* Band, now
i hi* Department of Athletics only has the ex
istence ol the yell leaders and the perfor
mance of the football team to be embar
rassed about.
"Admittedly, the theme of their C )regon
halftiine show may not have been the em
bodiment of brilliance.
"But suspending the truly incomparable
band for one to three games is definitely
going overbt >ard.
"I lere are some of the most 'disrespect
ful' l\rit s from the Band's show:
"Mr. Spotted ()wl! Mr. Spotted ()wl!
Your environment has been destroyed;
your home is now .1 roll of Brawny and your
family has flown the coop."
"Mavbe we better airlift the stall of Coun
seling .ind IN\< hological Services to help the
()regonians through severe emotional
shock."
Bottom Line: Isn't the editorial staff always right?
Amen.
