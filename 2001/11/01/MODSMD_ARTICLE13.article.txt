WASHING I ON (AP) — A
New York woman died of in
halation anthrax yesterday,
the font th person to perish in a
spreading wave o! bioterror
ism. A co-worker underwent
tests lor a suspicious skin le
sion. heightening concern the
disease was spreading outside
the mail system.
Despite an intensive four
week investigation by the FBI
.iikl health experts, Attorney
General |olm Ashcrolt s.iid, "I
have no progress to report" in
identifying the culprits or pre
venting further attacks.
"I think for the American
people it's frightening, it's
scary." conceded White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer, as au
thorities also reported a new sus
pected case of skin anthrax in
volving a New Jersey postal
worker and closed the facility
where he works.
President Bush and Ashcrolt
both employed humor in public
appearances during the day — a
rarity in the weeks since the
Sept. I 1 terrorist attacks and
onset ol the spread of anthrax.
Bush quipped he had been
"icing down my arm" after pitch
ing the ceremonial lust ball at
I uesda\ night's World Series
game, and the attorney general
joked about a new haircut that
had drawn unflattering reviews.
And there was cause for
some optimism in the nation's
capital, Dr. Patrick Meehan of
the (Centers foi Disease (lontrol
and Prevention said no new
cases of the disease had been
reported in Washington for
several days. Federal officials
said some — but not all — local
residents on medication could

discontinue then antibiotics. a
recommendation the ut\ was
studying.
Authorities expressed par
ticular concern over the earl\
morning death of kath\ I
Nguyen, a (>l-year-old Viet
namese immigrant who lived
alone in the Bronx and worked
in .1 small Manhattan hospital.
Doctors sedated her and put
her on a ventilator after she
checked into a hospital three
days ago, and olhcials said she
had been too sick to assist thetn
in their investigation.
I he woman worked in.i base
ment supply room that had rec cut -
l\ included a mailroom, bin there
were no reports ol suspicious let
ters or other obvious cause Ibi
alarm — a sharp contrast to other
cases in which t.iintc-d mail has
been linked to the disease.
"So far all of the environ
mental tests at the hospi
tal . . . all of the environmental
tests taken at her home" ha\e
proven to be negative for an
thrax, said New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. lie
said a sample taken from lu-i
clothing had yielded some indi
cations'' of the bacteria and lur
ther tests were being completed.
At the White I louse, Fleischer
told reporters that a co-worker
of Nguyen at the Manhattan Fve
Far and Fliroat Hospital had re
ported a skin lesion that raised
concern. "Tests are being clone.
I he tests were just undertaken,
and so there's nothing even pre
liminary to report," he said.
In all, ollicials have tallied I 7
cases of anthrax including the
first confirmed diagnosis on Oct.
5. I here have been 1(1 c ases ol
the inhalational form of the dis
ease — including all lour deaths
— and seven occurrences of the
less dangerous skin type. Tensol
thousands of other people,
many of them postal service
workers, are taking antibiotic s.
