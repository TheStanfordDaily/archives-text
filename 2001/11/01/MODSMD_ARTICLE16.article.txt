## The 						Stanford Daily Tenure decision is sensitive to all parents' needs 
### 
A i last week's Faculty Senate meet
ing, the Senate voted unanimously
to .idd adoptive pat ents and new fa
thers to the list of those eligible fora
(enure dock extension of one year. We ap
plaud this decision because o! iis symbolic
and practical importance to the faculty. It
shows that a tenured professorship and a
famih need not be mutually exclusive goals.
Most professors are appointed for seven
years as an assistant professor. After this
lime, the\ are reviewed for tenure. Most
faculty are either granted tenure or leave
the I niversitv at this point. Currently,
birth mothers can apply to have their
tenure review deferred fora year, meaning
the\ will be evaluated after their eighth
year at Stanford.
I his change, which must be approved by
the Board of I'rustces during its next meet-

Published Since IS'tl

ing in December, is important on several lev
els. It indicates that the I'Diversity recog
nizes how children affect all patents' lives
and that the disruptions are not limited to
mothers who gave birth.
I he revised Faculty tenure Policy clause
allows parents to apply for the extension for
up to one year after the birth or adoption of
a child.
On a practical level, the policy ensures
that new parents can make child care a pri
ority without worrying that the\ will be pe
nalized for taking a break from their teach
ing and research.
Specifically, allow ing fathers who endure
"substantial and sustained child < are respon
sibilities" to apply for the extension show s an
understanding of modern family life, w here
fathers often are as involved with parental
duties as mothers.

Covering adoptive parents also shows an
understanding of contemporary life. Cer
tainly parents who adopt a child face the
same difficulties and time constraints that
birth parents do while I he child is young.
Some faculty have expressed skepticism
that this program could lead to "free-riding"
by professors w ho need the extra time more
for professional reasons than personal ones.
Hut the j)oli( \ makes such ac tivitv difficult by
limiting the one-vcar extensions to no more
than three and not allowing the option dur
ing the last year of the tenure (lock.
In addition, this type of polic\ has worked
well elsewhere. Princeton, Harvard and the
University of ( alifornia system .ill have sim
ilar policies for fathers and adoptive pat ents.
It is important for Stanford to offer a similar
program so that it can effectively compete
with these s( hools for voting faculty.

Other people have pressed for more ex
tensions of tenure review. 1 hey question if
the policy should be extended to professors
who must take care of a terminally ill child,
an aging parent or a sick spouse.
These reasons for time off are just as valid
as a new child, but they are more difficult to
assess fairly. All children require close care
during their first year, but caring foi an aging
parent can vary widely in both time spent
and the type of care. These exemptions
should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
In general, limiting the tenure extension
to birth mothers reflects an antiquated view
of the 112 amily and of society in general.
This change in policy indicates that the
University has a better grasp of modern re
sponsibilities and encourages faculty to cre
ate a proper balance between their personal
and professional lives.
