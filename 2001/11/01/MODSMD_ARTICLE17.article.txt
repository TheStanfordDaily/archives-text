the table shaking her head and lamenting
rather londh. "Why, oh wliv, did I ever
conic to grad st liool?" I hat was nit'.
And so tin- da\s continue to pass. I
walk Irom one (lass to the next in a log,
and the homework assignments have
started to lade into one massive had
dream. I wake up. I studv, I eat. I sleep. 1
can't rememhei w hat the world looks like
outside the narrow (orridor Irom l\stou

don't know w hen or w b) mv life become

Remember those t hoose-vour-own-ad
ventnre books tb.it were sold at book lairs
m elemental \ st lioolr I loved those books,
and I would read them do/ens o! times
trying to get through even single possible
scenario. II lile were like those books, I
can't help but wonder which direction I
would go. Just imagine:
1) It's Monday, three da\s ago. Sarah
wakes up and thinks about how nice her
weekend was, mainly because she didn't
do much homework. "That's OK," she
reasons. " I bis week shouldn't be any
worse than the last." She pit ks up her
planner and suddenh reali/es how wrong
she was. With .ill hope of enjoying a relax
ing week crushed, she takes her first
midterm I wo d.i\s pass and she gels her
midterm hat k II she s< ores above the class
average, continue to #2. 11 she fails miser
ably, skip to #.'l.
2) Whew — she passed. One hurdle is
out of the wa\. In an attempt to get < aught
up on the problem sets she neglct ted over
the weekend, Sarah heads to the library
with some fellow grad students and stays
there for the entire day, pausing only to
quickly eat a sandwich. If she makes
promising headway on homework, go to
#1. If she suffers a mental breakdown
around dinner time, go to #5.
3) ( rushed and disheartened by her sad
perfbrmant e on the midterm, Sarah skips
the rest of'hei classes that day and heads
home. She sees her Halloween costume
lying on the bed and puts it on in an at

tempt to cheer herself up In temporarik
becoming someone else II lici efforts ait'
successful and she puts the costume awax
at the end of the dav, go to #<>. II she de
(ides th.it being someone else is nine h bet
ter than being a grad student and never
takes the < ostume ofl again, go to #7.
I) All right, things are going well. Sarah
reali/es that il she works diligently and
never again makes the mistake ol thinking
she can spend .1 weekend without study
ing, like a noi mal pel son, she has a good
< hance ol llourishing .is a grad student. 11
this is what she wants — to cledic ate mm h
of the next live years to earning the elusive
I'll. I). —go to #8. II she envisions a careei
change, go to #0.
.">) It's too much! I low < an anyone pos
sibh be expet led to deal with this constant
stream ol conservation equations and
feedback control systems and si ill remain
saner 11 Sarah finally dec ides that the wot k
isn't worth it and quits grad s< hool, go to
#10. II she* collapses in exhaustion but
wakes up a few hours later with renewed
motivation and realized she |iist needed a
nap. go to #8.
(i) 112 eeling calmer. Sarah sits down to
ponder what her future holds. She's dis
appointed about doing badly on her
midterm, and wonders if grad school is
really what she wants to do alter all. If
she wises up and concludes that one
midterm doesn't mean the end ol the
world, go to #8. If she realizes that what
she really wants to do is become a jour
nalist. go to #0.
7) She max spend the rest of her days xvan
dcring downtown San Francisco in a silly
looking I lalloween costume babbling alxnit
how her real name is Moonbeam, but at least
Sarah lixes happily ever alier. I lie Fnd.
8) With her inner academic fire rekin
dled. Sarah earns a Ph.D. in aeronautics
and astronautics at Stanford. Upon gradu
ation. she is offered a professorship at a top
university xvliere she is able to combine her
love of research with her love of students
and lixes happily ever after. I he Fnd.
9) Sarah switches gears from engineer
ing to the liberal arts and throws all her
persuasive powers into soliciting funds
from rich Bay Area residents to start a
travel magazine. She spends her days
wandering the world taking beautiful
photographs and composing witty com
mentary about her experiences for an ap
preciative and adoring audience, and lives
happily ever after. The Fnd.
10) Sarah finds that her bachelor's de
gree is more than enough to satisfy poten
tial employers and soon accepts a job oiler
from the company she has interned with
for the last four years. She returns to the
heat and humidity of Houston with no re
grets. She lives happily ever after. I he Fnd.

Sarah would love to knmv how things turned out
for her when you chose her adventure. Does she
have a Ph.D., a job, a magazine, or a strait jack
et? Iftherknmal grayheaKa stanford.edu.
