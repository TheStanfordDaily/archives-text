Former Olympian supports
Bay Area games
I laving lived in Sydney, Australia lor
the year preceding the 2000 Summer
Olympics (to train in tlu- sport of wind
surfing), I had a chance to seeSvdnex -
siders transform from being reluctant
and resentful of the inconveniences
they might experience to whole-heart
edlx embrac ing the idea and the spirit
of the (lames.
Instead of dwelling on the potential
negatives, Svdney-siders took the oppot
tunit\ to showcase their wonderful c ulture
and beautiful city. And it worked! Like
wise, if the Bay Area comes together
around the common goal of bringing the
()lympics here, it will happen.
Clearly, the Bay Area is more than ca
pable of hosting a remarkable Olympics.
Stanford has no shortage of top notch
venues. Asa past Olympian, I would wel
come the opportunity to bring my family
onto campus to watch theOames. I'm sure
I will get that competitive itch again. Isanx
c hance of bumping us up in the queue
from 2012?

The cult of the GPA is embedded in the
legal system
I write in response to Rob (iaudet's col
limn, " I he (lull of the GPA," which ap
pea red on ()< t. 24. As Gaudet rightly ex

plains, la\s m liools do put <111 overwhelm
ing amount of emphasis 011 grade point
average and I.SAI scores. But to Ik- lair,
some law m liools also tr\. to an extent, to
lake into account people's unic]ue hack
ground and experiences. Stanford is one
sue li s< hool.
In contrast to (iaudet's claim, there
fore, Mahatma (ili.mdi prohablv would
have gained admission to Stanford. I low
ever. once (>handi enrolled, his unique
ness would cease to exist, as it does for
even other law student. Indeed, the prob
lems Ciaudet describes in his column are
endemic not onl\ to law schools but to the
legal profession in general, which is ob
sessed with ranking and ordering.
Law students, lor example, seem to
rank everything: I'hey rank other law
schools; they rank courts throughout the
I nited Stairs; tlicv rank law firms; and
they even rank their own professors. And,
of course. tlic \ themselves are ranked Imhli
In their s< liools and bv their potential em
ployers in turn. It is no wonder, therefore,
that so many law students become grade
obsessed and c ease to move, as (Jaudet sug
gests they should, "outside the box."
Stanford is known to be a kinder and
gentler law school than most. This is
partly because Stanford's law students
have several options to exempt them
selves from the (.I'A mania that Ciaudet
describes by taking as many classes as
they wish on a pass-fail basis during their
first semester.
Nevertheless, the new administration
has reduced the number of classes that
students are allowed to take on a pass/fail

basis from live to two (in exchange Ibr rais
ing the mean (iPA l)\ 0.2 points), fhis
policy, which was implemented In tin- fac
ulty tfiis fall, allows students less freedom
to take internships outside ol law school
and gives them less incentive to explore
personal interests outside of their classes.
At the same time, the new. higher GI'A
will make Stanford's law students more
appealing to those emplovers who care
about CPAs most: law firms.
The I aw's obsession with rankings cre
ates pressure and makes it impossible to
escape the "Cult of the C«PA." The sad
truth is that even Mahatma (>handi would
have suffered as a result.
