# Against the attacks on America's moral certainty
## 
### JASON RHEINS GUEST COLUMNIST 
I.tin submitting the following piece in re
sponse to oilier letters and guest columns
recently printed in 1 lie Dailv that were re
sponses to ad and lei lure that the Stanford
()bjectivisi (.l ul > sponsored.
()n college i anipuses and in some of the
more liberal publications, a new type of ar
gument to slop current and future military
campaigns against terrorists and the gov
ernments that sponsor tlieni is emerging. It
is nol the old pacifism that 112 rets the loss of in
iKKcnis in the enemy's country and urges
unlimited diplomat y. 1 lus line of argument
makes pacifism look almost jingoistic by
comparison, which is why until recently ii
was very rarel\ heard outside the en
trenched bastions of the left wing in Ameri
ca's universities.
1 lie arguments in question claim that
America has no right i<> wage a war of'self
defense Ixrause il would not be self-defense.
I be I nited Slates, these arguments run, is
(lie aggressor, and Americans are ilie ter
rorists. 1 bis line of thought seeks to reverse
the moral roles of the land of the free with
the nations and organizations that systemat

ically oppress their own peoples and wage
war against innocents around the world.
An argument like: "America helped start
the Taliban, we created that terrorist group.
It's our fault so we shouldn't fight—we
reap what we sow" does not relv on con
vincing the listener that Americ a has been in
error, but that our country is evil.
II one thought our country had simply
made a mistake In supporting the wrong
groups in the past, then the logical conclu
sion to draw would be to fix the problem l>\
stopping our support of terrorists and dic
tatorships, defeating our enemies regard
less of whether or not we empowered them
.iiul totally refraining in the future from
giving aid to potential enemies.
1 lowever, if one Ix-lieved that the I nited
States is the bulb of the world and a terror
ist state — morally debased, tyrannical and
oppressive — then why would one want to
save it? Why not leave it to the wolves? 1 he
gimmick of these arguments is their at lac k
on America's moral stature, the person
who makes this argument is trying to
morally equate America with its enemies or
worse, often upholding murders .is free
dom fighters.
I'oday the single greatest threat loAiner

ica is not planes being hijacked or even an
anthraxepidemic. It is the destruction of our
moral certainty. (liven any particular threat
to his life a man can (hoose to at least try to
eliminate it. .md if the man, like our country,
has the resources and abilitv to overcome his
obstacles or thwart his enemies, then lie has
nothing to fear. 1 lowever, to put forward the
effort <>112 self-preservation a person must
know that he is worthy of living. A person
who docs not consider himself to Ik- of any
value would have neither the incentive nor
the will to lake the necessan steps to defend
himself, even if the threat he was facing was
dire. 'Worthless' implies not worth fighting
for. It is the same with am country.
11 Kit is win these arguments are not
mereh unjust and untrue but also terribly
dangerous. I he\ result in lack of resolve
and doubt in the legitiinai \ of our stance for
self-defense, lnunediateh after the attacks
the l'i csident < fist ussed the conllic tin terms
of good against evil and freedom against
tyrannv. Already the moral rhetoric has
been dropped Now we are inviting terror
suppoi ting nations to join our coalition and
dying to compromise.
It adopted b\ our leaders, these ideas will
make out already weak foreign |x>lic\ suic i

dal. If we look these ideas serioush we would
think that our enemies are not evil madmen
who by their own admissions are out to de
stroy Americ a and its allies, but rather a rea
sonable |M>liiical opposition th.it can lx- dealt
with by means of negotiation. We would In
led to believe that if we pulled out all our inil
itary presence from the Middle Kast, aban
doned our ally Israel and gave up an\ inter
ests we had invested in the area, then we
wcmid ac hieve more security rather I ban less.
We would consider it a good idea to re
spond to an attack on our citi/cns l>\ apolo
gizing and giving our assailants whatever
they demanded. In short, the subscription
to these ideas would lead to treating crimi
nals and dictators like potential partners;
attempting to defend our country In aban
doning defense, self-interest and allies; and
rewarding terrorists for their crimes In ap
peasing them. Those are the very mistakes
that American leaders have been making
for 50 years, mistakes that have embold
ened and strengthened the enemies we
must now fight.
I low ever, the opposite belief, the comic -
(ion that America has the moral high
ground, would remind us that this is a battle
between good and evil giving us the resolve

to use our power lot rush terrorism with the
lull military might of the world's only super
power. We would not try to appease our as
sailants or cut deals with those who want to
destro) us We would fight the terrorist net
woi ks and governments thai are infamous
around the world for their flagrant viola
tions of human i iglits.
l he I nited Slates is not an evil, terrorist
nation. If we bad suit ide lumbers we would
not celebrate them as bob martyrs. We do
nol sing the praises ol the murderers who
lake innocent lives but of the heroes who
save them. We do nol deliberately strike at
civilian targets like- cowards or try to maxi
mize lhe number of innocents that are
killed. We do not ruthlessly persecute those
who do not hold a particular creed. Rather,
we strive to defend our cherished rights of
life, libertv and lhe pursuit ol happiness.
Are Americans justified in lielieving that
tlieii country is good? Ibe incomparable
wealth il < i t ales, the tec hnological marvels it
produces and, above all. the unparalleled
freedoms ii protects ought to convince us
thai our country is worth fighting for.
