to win a game," |ctcr said. "When you get to the

postseason, you can throw everything out that
you've done in the regular season."

everything Arizona could have asked. But
when Kim relieved, the game turned spooky
for the Diamondbac ks on Halloween night.
"We had a lead, we had six outs left to go in
the ballganie," Arizona manager Bob Brenly
said. " That's the way we hoped it would work
