## The Devil's anonymity: The elusive face of evil
### SEBASTIAN DAVIS 
|<>nalhan () I oole. one ol the protag
onists in Man Levin and Daphne
Pinkerson's documentary "Soldiers in
the Army ol God." is .1 M)-vear-old boy
living in Bowden, (ieorgia. Ilis matur
ing voice is siill helied l»\ .111 almost mu
sical bovish enthusiasm — a profound 1\
Southern affectation laced with the iu
noceiu e ol youth and the sell-righteous
ness ol ignoi am e. lie has hair as black .is
Georgia peat and eves to match, slight 1\
crossed so that it's hard to discern
whether lie's looking at \oii ot through
you. like in a (iiotto painting.
As the title would suggest, jonathon is
.1 soldu i in the "Arnn ol God," a funda
mentalist Ghristian militia 111.11 lias de
clared a boh crusade upon the "cold
blooded murdei" ol abortion. |onathon
has \et to act violenth upon these pas
sions, content Ibi now to picket and
liver, but he searns Ibi the time when
"pro\ idem e will appoint him to pit k up
the sword."
I he audience never sees anget in
Jonathan's eves, 01 tear and sell
loathing. |onathan has things figured
out — his voice is measured and calt 11-
lated, his ga/.e unwavering, his commit
ment unquestionable; Jonathan will kill,
and most Is likeb kill soon, and 110 one in
the audience could quite figure how
someone like him was created.
I he elusiveness ol evil, like a tran
sient contagion infecting and spread
ing, was examined Irom several pro
voking angles ai the I nited Nations
Association film Festival. Ii is a quali
l\ unusually difficult to distill, but in
the Oscar nominated "Long Night's
Journc\ into Day," directed by Frances
Reid and Deborah Hoffmann, it be
comes nearly impossible.
Set in post-apartheid South Africa,
the film deals with the problem ol
amnesty for apartheid-era criminals,
file Ifii 1 hand Reconciliation Goin
inission ( I KG) is created with the
daunting task ol sifting through these
criminal cases one by one, trying to de
termine il the ( limes were committed
through unmitigated human malice,
or il they were simpl) incubated in .111
equally evil crucible.
flic highest profile case involved the
murder of Amy Bichl, a Stanford stu
dent living in South Africa on a Ful
bright scholarship. Amazingly, her par
ents argued in support of amnesty lor
their child's killers. In the end. I sup
pose this is how you defeat evil — not
with more, even justifiable violence, but
with heart-wrenching, excruciating
mercy to salve to wounds.
Even in the most morally ambiguous
case, that of Robert .Vh Bride, an anti
apartheid terrorist guilty of firebombing
a popular bar, it was impossible to ig

nore the humanitx in his haunted coun
tenance — he was tearfully apologetic,
not to his cause or convii lion, but to the
pain-sirit ken fainih members of his vic
tims. A small consolation perhaps, hut at
leasi there's something to save, some
thing to build upon.
I'hesc are important distinctions iu
an era when Osama bin Laden s face is
frozen upon GNN. I asked the diret 101 s
il ilie\ found it more dill'unit to demo
ni/e the Septeinbei II lb tei 1011st s given
their observations ol the comple\it\ of
human violence — tlieii answers were
quit k and unfaltei ing:
"1 hat was a completely evil act," s.iid
Reid. "In South Africa vou can under
stand die grievances, the mindset ...
these ,uis vou can't understand, \ou
(.m i e(]iiale [.ipartheid terroiisis| with
bin I .aden."
Ii might be that the recent terioiisin
011 New 01 k and l).( . siinplv hit (losei
to home, bill il these two women ( an siill
belicve iu pure evil allei all thev've seen,
then perhaps we're dealing with a new
si 1.1111 of enemy.
\nother film, "I lunian Remains." di
rected b\ |a\ Rosenblatt, detailed the
personal profiles ol the 2(>ih (cntun's
most notorious (lit tators: Hitler, St aI i 11,
Franco, Mussolini and Mao. Rosenblatt
never mentions .1 political 01 militarv de
tail, sticking exclusiveb to dail\ habits,
phobias, likes, dislikes, and so on. Aside
from a lew brow-raising similarities
both Sialin and Franco were 011K 51",
and both Hitler and Mao had onl\ one
testicle — what was terrifying was how
incredihh ordinary the live men were.
None ol them drank human blood or
killed their parents; rathei. we saw por
traits ol five very lonclv, self-conscious
individuals, most of whom had a great
deal of trouble falling asleep at night.
II only evil men had cloven hooves
and pitchforks and spat sulphurous balls
of flame into the night sk\. But alas the\
look no different from us. and perhaps
1 hey weren't evil vesterdav,and perhaps
they won't be evil tomorrow, but Ibi now
they tester and metastasize.
jonathon O'Toole was most likeb
raised to hate and punish those who
think differently from him in the name
of the Bible. How accountable do we
hold him for this indocti illation? I pra\
that the message I should take from
these films is that c\ il environments cre
ate evil people, and that il vou lix the en
vironments then you fix the people —
but the messages seems to be more mud
died, more complex.
The devil is elusive, and catching
him, 1 fear, is like try ing to catch a soap
bubble. Perhaps the fruth and Recon
ciliation Gommission has found the only
viable answer: dealing with every person
case-by-case-by-case, because evil is viral
and 110 one is inoculated.
