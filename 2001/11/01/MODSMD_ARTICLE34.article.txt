Snoop's dominion, and .is he puts it in "Honrs," "It's a dog-eat
dog wot Id."

Nevertheless, hones, like its predecessors "Tales Irom the

II "Hones (ould at all be deemed a breakthrough in
moviemaking, it is that the fust two pec>ple to die in it are white.
It is .in old 11Â«>11\ wood joke to lake bets on how e.n l\ in the (ilm

today's horroi Hit ks, I don't know w here is a more dangerous

"Hones" is .in intelligent and probing examination ol racial
relations and ol the c hallenges young black men lac e
iu (I c|iiote from the film) a "post-racial" sot ietv. All this, howex
er, is but mere filling before we get to the main draw of the
movie: Snoop Dogg.
In "Hones," Snoop revisits a role he is not unfamiliar with.
The 1992 Player of the Year Award recipient (yes, there is such
an honor, given annually by an official bod\ of international
plavei s w ho elect among their brethren a trul\ outstanding per
former), Snoop plays a pimp, and not just any pimp. It's a role
Snoop can trul\ sink his canines in: a seventies pimp.
Slowb emerging from his smoke-filled Cadillac, his coat
draped over his shoulders like a cape and his penned hair flow
ing. Snoop seems as comfortable in the role as a clieei leader in
the backseat ola car. Yet this ease may be explained by Snoop's
real life experience: in a c andid I loward Stern interview, Snoop
revealed that he has anywhere between 10 and 15 girls working
lor him at a time.
