# Band hangs by thread, not moment
## 
### MISTY ESPINOZA 
I he Oct. 23rd Lifehou.se show
marked an interesting anniversary for
the band. As Jason Wade, the lead
singer and guitarist, explained to a sold
out audience at the W'arfleld, "We
played in San Francisco exactly a year
ago .md you couldn't pay people to hear
ih play. Now, it's incredible to see all of
vou here to see us." And since that ca
reer low-point a year ago, the guvs of
Lilehouse have been doing nothing but
lilting I hern selves up to this career - high.
After months of opening fora diverse
group of acts including Codstnac k,
I'earl |am and Matchbox I went) . Lile
house, which consists of Wade, Sergio
\ndrade on bass and Rick Woolsten
liuhne on drums, stepped out onto the
sl.tge lor their Bay Area stop of their na
tion.il headlining tour. "We've been
waiting for ibis fora long time," ex
plained Woolstenhulme, who spoke
with Intelmission last week. "Playing
for your fans even night is ama/ing!"
Critics quickly lumped Lilehouse in
with other alternative rock groups ol
the moment, but there are some associ
ations that make Woolstenhulme
(riirge.
" I he comparison to Creed definitely
bugs me," he said. "No one in the band
is a huge Creed fan. We respect them,
but I don't think we sound anything
like them."
Although stand-out cuts on their "No
Name Face" LP, such as "Sick Cycle
Carousel," "Somewhere in Between,"
"Breathing" and "Trying," are depar
tures from the usual radio homogene

ity, much of the album offers the same
modern rock fare. The majority ol the
remaining tracks evokes little reaction
and is no different from groups sik Ii as
Nine Days, \ erl it al I lori/on and lonic
Citing musical influences such .is I he
Police, Stevie Wonder, lire Beatles,
Nirvana and Simon and Carfunkel,
Woolstenhulme asserted tli.it Lilehouse
stands out from the other mainstream
alternative rock miisit being plavcd.
"I think we have a huge dynamic
range. We basically have a simple song
and we ( .111 incorporate a bum Ii ol in
struments or go acoustic and it will still
remain powerful. We stress the lyrical
side and make sure that the music ac
< ompanics the l\ ric s."
A number ol tracks on the album
focus on the songwriter Wade's confu
sion about everything. In "Sonieboch
Klse's Song," Wade croons, "I remind
niyscll ol someboch else feeling like
I'm (basing like I'm fating mysell
alone / I've got somebody else's
thoughts in my head." I his is covered
yet again 011 "Unknown," in which
Wade laments, "I am against mysell
again / trying to lit these pieces in/
walking on a (loud ol dust to get into
you." Obviously, Wade believes that lie
is bis own worst enemy, as this theme re
turns in every other song.
Sell-deprecation aside, Lilehouse
does deliver a high-energy show. I'he
guys have elevated their own stage act
by sharpening their performance skills
as an opening ac t for sold out audiences
in venues such as Mac.'ison Square Oar
den. Last Tuesday's performance
proved that practice does indeed make

Klse's Song," Wade croons, "I remind
niyscll ol someboch else feeling like
I'm (basing like I'm fating mysell
alone / I've got somebody else's
thoughts in my head." I his is covered
yet again 011 "Unknown," in which
Wade laments, "I am against mysell
again / trying to lit these pieces in/
walking on a (loud ol dust to get into
you." Obviously, Wade believes that lie
is bis own worst enemy, as this theme re
turns in every other song.
Sell-deprecation aside, Lilehouse
does deliver a high-energy show. I'he
guys have elevated their own stage act
by sharpening their performance skills
as an opening ac t for sold out audiences
in venues such as Mac.'ison Square Oar
den. Last Tuesday's performance
proved that practice does indeed make

perfect. Ihe .111-
