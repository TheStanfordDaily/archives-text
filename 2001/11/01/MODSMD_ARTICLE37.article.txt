Friday, however, was no such event. In
stead of elegance and tranquility, the San
Francisco Symphony delivered .1 deafen
ing performance. Instead of a hiatus, the
orchestra supplied its audience with yet
another headache.

Such complaints should be directed to Andreas Dells,

the evening's conductor. Although equipped with a spec -
tacular resume and a rc\id\-lot-television smile, the Mae
stro did not tread through the evening's program with .id
equate foresight. Mis interpretations lacked methodical
planning and a cohesive outlook.
I lie first piece on the program was Boris lilac her's"()r
-c hestral \ .11 iations on .1 I heme In I'aganini." Admittedly,
most ol the- variations are l)iis\ and quite dense and Blac It
er is to blame lot this, not Dells. In lad, the final two vari
ations — brighter and more light hearted than the rest —
were well executed and downright Inn Vsk the cellos: the)
seemed to enjoy the tango-like bassline.

I nlike the Blather, however,
Rac lunaninoH's "Rhapsody on .1
I heme ol I'aganini" c annot be ac -
cused of being unjustl\ dense or
busy. I lie evening's pianist was
lloracio (iutierrez, a rather large
man whose immense fingers were
extraordinarily deft. Too much so.
Both Clutierrez and Dells chose

consistently edgy tempos. ('.ombiued with the robust dy
namic s, these tempos diminished the Rhapsody's roman
tic luster.
(lutierre/'s brevity was displayed in other areas .is well.
He often exaggerated staccatos 01 jabbed aggressively at
the melody. Even the more minute details seemed rushed:
when holding .1 chord, (iutierre/ would let go of the key

thetic error. I couldn't help but wonder il the lumbering
pi.mist was in a hurry to go somewhere.
I lie 01c hestra's accompaniment ol the Rac hinaninofl
was .ilso far from perfect, suggesting tli.it the piece was
substantial!) under-rehearsed. Occasionally, the violins
were sloppy and at least once, the winds fell behind the
rest ol the orchestra. Despite .ill this, (iutiei re/, Dells and
the San Francisco Svmphon) received multiple standing
ovations at the end of the coda. 1 believe the audience was
too generous.
After intermission, the orchestra performed Sibelius'
epic Second Svmphon). (>1 u e again, I Jell's interpretation
lacked a definitive structure and a sense ol direction. I lie
fourth movement — characterized by Sibelius' typical dia
logue between timpani and strings, along with impressive
chords in the brass — was particularly harsh. Even when
they held back. the orchestra was repeatedly encouraged
to play louder.
And louder, Maestro, is not always the best way to ex
press emotion. Fvcn the loudest of works in the orchestral
repertoire — Shostakovich's "Fifth Symphony" with its
giant ending, Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" with its massive
dissonant chords, Ichaikovsky's 'IS 12 Overture" with its
i annon, or Bet lio/'s "Symphonic* Fantastique" with its gar
gantuan orchestration — they all rarely require sustained
volume. I heir beauty lies in contrast and suspense, not
sheer magnitude. No concert should blast its listeners for
two hours straight. No concert should feel like cumming
uncontrollably for two hours.
