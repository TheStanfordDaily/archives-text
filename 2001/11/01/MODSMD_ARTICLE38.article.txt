# Yo, buss dis: C-Murder's lates sucks

### NICK CATON 
Rapper ('.-Murder, of relatcd-to-Master-l'
fame, ret cully released his fourth album,"(l
- which proves lo he vet another dis
appointing ollering from No Limit Studios.
At its hest, the album is admirable for its in
novative and varied heats. At its worst, whit h

is ,i significant portion of the

quality. I hey are stvlisticallx varied in feeling
and meter, hnt do not tl< »\n . Fans who recall
ilris strength on his last album, " 1 Yapped in
('.rime," will be disappointed bv the infre
quency and brevitv of ('.-Murder's rhyming
in "(l-l'-3.cotn."
When (1-Murder docs flow, there are
spots that hint at the rapper's plagiarism. In

"Young (ihetto Box," (1-
Murdei de( lares, "( -Mm
dcr was the name that thc\
gave me." intoned exact h
the same wax as Snoop
I>gg iapped "inni<ler xx.is
the < ase that ibex gaxc me"
in his famous "Murdei \\ as

the ( ase
Similaritiessuch as this xx'ere numerous on
lhe album, including "back iliat thang up,
bat k that I hang up," i apped cxa< tlx as in |n
vcnile's "Bat k tli.it Ass I p." It's possible that
( Murdci x iexss these stolen lines as tributes
toothci i appet s' songs, but nonetheless. I hex
Minplx don't fit into the beats and context in
whi( h lie loi« <s tliein.
I lie much lix ped, ant it i paled hit. "What
I (>onua Do?" was actually one of mx least

favorite tracks. I here's very little substantive
rapping from ('.-Murder himself, relying
heavily on back-up singers repeating,"What
von gonna do when we come for you?," in a
six Ic that makes the track a suitable candidate
fbi the "(lops: |amai(a" theme song.
I he album's most redeeming track is "I'm
Not |nst." in which (1-Murder declares, "I
|iist ain't no good-ass rapper." I'll assume by
ibis lie means lie's a badass, and not that he
thinks he sin ks as mm h as I think he docs.
Nevertheless, "I'm Not | ust" provides the
onlx (letent fl< >u of the xvholc album xxlien (1-
Murtler raps, "llcttei hope xou don't see me
coming down xoui street in a beat-up ( ut
lass. hauling ass with the windows down in a
ski mask s< reaming 'fin k!"' I 'his is a decent
\ci i.ne flow in an album pat ketl with repeti
tious lines sin has "I don't give a fu(k and
"I in t i iniinal minded."
In some of the trat ks, (i-Murdcr seems to
have not onlx anticipated criticism, hni to
liaxe delcnded against il as well. In "Don't
Mailer, he (let lares, "Don't mailer how
much xou bale me betause I'll alxvaxs be on
top," and continues, "It don't phase me —
true players going to feel inc."

I think it's prett\ sale lo sa\ that there
.in-ill enough ol these "true players'' that
"leel" ( -Murder to put him, or this album,
on top.


Poser.
