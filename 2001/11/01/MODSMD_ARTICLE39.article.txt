|udging from its debut f.l\ "A Storv in
White." Glasgow rock band Aere
ograiume really likes its guitars. From
the opening riffs of "The Question is

Complete" to the
power chords that
close "The Art ol
Belief', the band
rarely wastes ail op
portunity to hit the
listener with the
sonic crunch of
electric guitars
playing lull blast.
I rue, there are
bits ol electronica
and piano sprin
kled in, as well as a
( onstant bat kdi op
of steady percus
sion, but listening
to "A Story in
White" for even a
few minutes makes
it abundantly clear
that it's all about
the guitars.

That's not really a bad thing. There's
a feeling of intensely vist eral satisfaction
every time the guitars really kit kin and
start blasting, when Aero
gramme employs the soft-loud-soft-loud

structure that it seems so
fond of.
And buried beneath the
thrashing and loud riffs is a
genuine knai k for ct ailing
catchv melodies and hooks.
Sure, there are times when
the formula seems, well, a

liii too formulaic, and when the soiijjs
seem to drag <>11 monotonously (do we
realh need si\ straight minutes of the
same powei t hords over and ovei:). but
the inusii generallx varies enough m
mood and melody, alternating gentle
melanchol\ with primal rage, to keep
our interest.
I nfortunately, the band doesn't fare
quite as well in the non-guitar areas.
Musically, when the tempo slows down
and the guitars are replaced b\ the
piano 01 jangly bits of elet troniia, Aere
ogramme begins to sound like a pale im
itation ol other angst-filled British
bauds, particularly Kadiohead.
Lyrically, Aereogramme suffers from
the same sense of anonymity and deriva
liveness. loo bad that the lyric s la< k the
cool inventiveness ol the song titles.

it's still a lot of fun.
