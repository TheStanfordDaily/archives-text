# Stanford solar power usage ahead of time

### SARAH PAPÉ 
While recent slate legislation is offer
ing incentives to homeowners who
switch to solar power, Stanford has al
read\ begun installing solar powei fa< ili
lies at the new Jasper Ridge field station
in the Foothills.
I"he Leslie S. Sun Field Station will
have 25:* photovoltaic panels loi elec
tricity «ind .in ac tive solar hot water heal
ing system. According to Susan ku
lakowski, campus cnerg\ manager loi
l .u ilitics ()perations, solai power i an be
used at the site because ol its excellent
sun exposure.
"Renewable power generation is con
sistent with the program and fiuu lion of
the facility," kulakowski said.
The Jasper Ridge station is pan of a
larger biological preserve, located
three miles awa\ from the main pari ol
campus. A wide range of research

takes place there, ranging from ecosys
tem studies to anthropology.
Work began .tt the station l.ist sum

Another place on (.impus looking to
use sol.u cncrin is Svueruv, a student

housing cooperative. Students have
begun .111 inui.iiive to install solar panels

While people throughout the state turn to solar power, Stanford's CoGen facility will re
main unaffected by the change in power source.
ation .ii the new C.arnegie (llobal
Ecology (Center.
I 'hough other homeowners .11 e
looking to solar power .is a \\.i\ to
avoid I>l.u konts and rising energ\
costs, Stanford has its own power
plant; thus, solai power is less of a
need and more of wa\ to take "ad
vantage of a Tree' fuel sourt e. ku
lakowsi said.
"Stanford will also benefit indi

rectly f >\ providing an example to
othei institutions and contributing
to .1 more sustainable energy fu
ture." she said.
No (flanges will be made to
( *»(.en, Stanford's power plant.
( o( ien, which is short for cogen
ei ation. is powered by natural gas
.iikl steam. Stanford uses half of the
plant's power and sells the rest to the
surrounding community.
"('.o( ien is efficient because it
maximizes the work obtained
from each unit of fuel," ku
lakowsi said.
Stanford is already one of the

most energy-edit ient researt It
universities in ('.alilbrnia. ()ver the
List decade, the I niversit\ has in
vested $() million in energv-elli
ciency improvements to campus
buildings. Another $750,000 is
budgeted lor this year.
Voters in San I-rancisco will de
cide Nov. (i whether to approve .1
$ 100 million bond measure to pro
mote solar and wind power. Spon
sors of the proposition hope it will
make the t itn one of the nation's
leaders in solar energy.
Also, legislation in ('.alilbrnia
provides monetary incentives lor

homeowneis to invest in solai
power. The ('.alilbrnia Renewable
Knerg\ Buvdown Program oilers
homeowners .1 $4,500 pet kilowatt
rebate il the\ swiu h to solar powei
or 50 percent oil the purchase of
solar power s\ stem.
Recentl\ (>ov.(>ra\ Davis ap
proved legislation offering a 15
percent t.ix credit, after the re
bate. for those who pun base
and install solai cnrrg\ svstenis.
It goes into aflect in Januarv
2002, but will cover am solar
energv investments made after
Jan. I. 2001.
