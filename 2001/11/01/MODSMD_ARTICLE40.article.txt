# '13 Ghosts' doesn't meet needs

If you happened to catch any of I he übiquitous ads
for " I'hirteen Ghosts," you probably ascertained that

the film itself is not exact
ly an exercise in restraint.
Willi its frenetic editing,
ha mmy per forma nces
and a truly irritating fetish
with strobe lights, " I'hir
teen Ghosts" is guaran
teed to hold your atten-

lion for its 90+ minutes
— bin may also render you stric ken with an epic, post
mausoleum parly-quality hangover.
Die film opens in <in abandoned junkyard, where
eccentric ghost-hunter Cyrus Kriticos is hot on the
trail of his latest quarry. When the pursuit goes trag
ically awry, Cyrus winds up dead. Kilter Cyrus'
nephew, Arthur, lie and his kids, struggling to gel
over the recent death of their mother, inherit Cyrus'
former residence, a secluded palace situated deep in
I lie woods of New Kngland. filings seem to be look
ing up for our protagonists, ext ept that, nun li to the
surprise of no one, Cyrus had a few I ricks up his
sleeve before he died and the house is not .ill that il
seems (dant-dant-I)AN 112!!).
Now, I might have been able to look past the
movie's MTV-pedigree il it had fulfilled a basic
need; that is. if it incited at least (lie same degree of

climax of the movie, .is F. Murra\ Abraham is being

carved into a thousand tiny pieces, the only
sensation gripping my body was disgust at
how low former Oscar-winners will sink fora

stantially from the misguided

heinous culprit here is writer

Neal Marshall-Stevens, who
lias this lame-ass tendency to expli
cate every piece of nonsense that ap
pears in bis script.
No one in the audience gives a
trap about the "WHY" in a horror
movie. We just want to see whatever
new, twisted devices the ghosts use to
screw with the characters' heads, and
usually their internal organs. We are
but simple folk, Neal. Appease us.
Yet the movie is not entirely with
out highlights. I lie make-up effects
are well done and the house that

Nonetheless, the movie ultimate!)
is just another indication ol the on

It's a shame, too, because there are few experiences
so exhilarating in life as watching a mean-spirited,
go-for-the-jugular horror Ilick in a movie-house
packed with jumpy teenage girls on a brisk in

If you crave a good scare this Halloween, I rec
ommend "Phantasm" or "Suspiria" or one ol the
other time-honored classics of the genre. Best to
leave "Thirteen Ghosts" in its final resting place.
