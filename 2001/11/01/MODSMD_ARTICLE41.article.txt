# Bring out the sex monster!

Dear Roxy Sass,
I've been with my boyfriend for a year and recently he's slarl
ed talking about threesomes. I think he's trying to hint that he'd
like to have one, but so far I've just ignored it. Do you think I
should go ahead and do it? Any advice?

Chasing Amy — I'll is is the best wav to tin n down the pro

logue, wh.it you're going to tell voin boyfriend is that you
don't want to share liini with anyone. And he shouldn't
want t<> share you with anyone eithei (espet ialh someone
named Banks!). And if that's not working, be \eiv whim,
use the voit e ol .in asthmati( * astrated weasel, and make
explicit mention of the tin cesomc vou participated in dm
ing youi wild high school \e.us (and how ultim.itel\ un

I he Sex Monster— Ibis is a little-known critically ac
«l.iimed Mariel I lemingway movie in whit li a husband (a

promptly ousted from the three-way when his wife discov
ers a sine ere gusto for the gii l-on-gii I ad ion. If you think the
idea of vou becoming an Anne Heche style switch-hitter
would state the notion from your Ijoyfriend's one-track
mind, perhaps this is the movie to watch with him.
Threesome — I'his movie prefigures two possible results. It
could help you out of the situation. If'vour boyfriend has ho
mophobic issues, just mention you'd be happy to do the
three-way — with another guy, just like in the movie. Ik
will balk. I le will strut. I le will say he doesn't want to be
naked with another guv, and certainly doesn't want to (god

Don't let \<>in boyfriend choose. You will alwaxs wondei

Don't Nominate Vour Best Friend — I Ins will end badlv.
Worst case s<enario you get dropped In both ol them, and

shut the whole thing down. It's not a contest. I know we're

satishing it was).

I he Sex Monster— Ibis is a little-known critically ac
«l.iimed Mariel I lemingway movie in whit li a husband (a
|oles Ins wife into a threesome with his secretary, then is
promptly ousted from the three-way when his wife discov
ers a sine ere gusto for the gii l-on-gii I ad ion. If you think the
idea of vou becoming an Anne Heche style switch-hitter
would state the notion from your Ijoyfriend's one-track
mind, perhaps this is the movie to watch with him.
Threesome — I'his movie prefigures two possible results. It
could help you out of the situation. If'vour boyfriend has ho
mophobic issues, just mention you'd be happy to do the
three-way — with another guy, just like in the movie. Ik
will balk. I le will strut. I le will say he doesn't want to be
naked with another guv, and certainly doesn't want to (god
forbid) lout li anothei gti\. hven act identallv! ()i the movie
could help you decide you'd like to do it. II after watching
|osh ('.harles lust after Stephen Baldwin, von are up for this
(Imi.iiiiii trio, keep ieading. I lere are some dos X: don'ts to
keep vou sane.
Do Ch<K»se Wisely II you're going the two girls — one
guv route, you must (boose the guest star very carefully.
Don't let \<>in boyfriend choose. You will alwaxs wondei

Don't Nominate Vour Best Friend — I Ins will end badlv.
Worst case s<enario you get dropped In both ol them, and
tbey move to K.V. as domestic partners Ibi Winter quarter.
Best c asescenario, vou sta\ friends but vou now know what
voui best friend looks like while she's having an orgasm
(hopefully) and this is not uecessai il\ something you need
to know.
Do Choose an M.E. or Product Design Major — I hey are
leputedb good with their hands.
Do Have A Drink — I'm not saving to get tanked. But a lit
tle alcohol can loosen inhibitions. Inhibitions in sexual ex
perimentation are like ('.l\Rs — everybody has to deal with
them, but they're easy to get rid of.
Don't Keep Track—lf you're watching whether your
lx>yfriend is enjoying himself more with her than with you.
shut the whole thing down. It's not a contest. I know we're
all competitive people, but save it lor the Physics series.
Do Remember To Have Fun — I his is a choice, and like
•ill sexual situations, you can say no. II you don't think
you're going to have fun. or you don't feel comfortable
