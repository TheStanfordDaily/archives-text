### VAUHINI VARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No matter how many times vou've
gone to the Strew Your Sib dance, the
mere mention that it is appro.i< liing al
ways seems to produce the same re
sponse — a wild grab at the phone
with one hand, and the laccbook with
the other.
For most students who have gone to
the dance, though, Screw Your Sib
doesn't end up being an introdut tioti to
their future life partners.
"Screw Your Sib is pureh for fun,"
said sophomore Sarah llm. one ol five
big Sib/Lil Sib coordinators lor the
Asian-American New Student Orienta
tion Committee, which plans and spon
sors the dance. "It's a great time to dress
up, get to know other people and |iist
take a break from your t\pical Stanford
weekend."
At the beginning of the vcar, incom
ing freshmen and transfer students iu
the Asian communit\ are matched up
with upperclassmcn to form sib families,
llm explained.
"We sponsor events throughout the
year for sib families to hang out. and the
Strew Youi Sib tlatue is out biggest
event, as well as one of, il not the biggest
social events held In the Asian-Ainei k an
communit\ at Stanford," llm said.
I bis vear's dance, which organi/ers
have labeled "As N» rewed As li (.els,' w ill
In- held tomorrow night in N(an/anita
Dining Commons from 9 p.m. tt) I a.m.
"Planning the dance has been a de
lightful combination of fun and stress."
llm said. " I lie coordinators have put a

lot of work into this dance, and I am pos
itive that it's going to be the best Strew
Your Sib held so far."
I ppeit lassmen use several methods
to set up their little sibs, Ihn explained.
"Ilvou're one of 'those intense big sibs,
von scan the facebook during the first
week of school and pick out some ran
dom vet good-looking person and go
talk to them or their big sibs," she said.
"Some big sibs take requests from their
little sibs and go direct!) to talk to that
person or that person's big sib.
"big sibs ustialU go with friends or get
set upbytheii friends," she added.
I reshman l .ian Bloch's big sib set her
up with someone she already knows, so
she won't experience the blind-date as
pet t of the experience.
"Still, 1 think it w ill be fun," blot h said,
"from a mixed perspective, I think
it'll be a good opportunity to get to
know Stanford's Asian community for
the first time," said blot h, who is half
white, half-Asian.
"()ne aspect of the AANSOC dance
that I realh admire is that it is not exclu
si\el\ Ysian, and I'm hopefully antic ip.it
ing that it will be comfortable for evcrv
one in attendance, regardless of their
i at e." bloc h s.nd.
for junior I is.i Ihll, it was comfort
able, indeed. She attended Screw Your

hei that (lav. and asked Hill to go with
her little sib. w hose date had canceled.
"b\ that night, I was all dolled up and
having a loveb dinner at benihana's
with Mike [her datc| and his sib laniih,"
I lill s.nd. "When I got there, 1 got a lot of
pu//led looks .is people politely asked,

'Who are you here with?'and 1 had a lot
of fun simply saving who my elate* was,
no explanations.
"Altogether, we had a great time
dant ing.and it was one of the best dances
and best nights out I've ever been to.
AANSOC really knows how to put on a
classv, fun dance," she said.
but for some of those who have been
"screwed," the experience was less
than ideal
"I'm not sure about the success rate of
setting people up for [the dance]." said
one sophomore girl. "Actually, most ol
m\ friends just assume their freshman
vear big sibs hated them."
"[Screw Your Sib] should be a chance
to meet and socialize with other fresh
men m \our etlinit community and to
have fun with your sib family," said an
other sophomore girl. "I nfortunatelv,
not enough thought goes into making
those things happen. A couple of frosh
are throw n together, shuttled into a bul
let line with some other frosh, and then
left to have dull conversations about 1-
I him at dinner."
"I think the success of the evening is
determined bv the big sibs." she contin
ued. "11 they consider w hat would be Inn
for them instead of how to put their little
sibs at ease, then some freshmen will
come away having wasted SlO on a nice
party favor."
1 here is one Strew Your Sib maneu
ver that is almost universalU deemed
questionable by veterans ol the dance.
"1 think the sketchiest storv is about a

Revelers at AANSOC's annual Screw Your Sib dance
(shown above in 1 999) never know what they're going
to get — a future life partner or a nightmare date from
hell This year's dance takes place tomorrow night.
No matter how many times vou've
gone to the Strew Your Sib dance, the
mere mention that it is appro.i< liing al
ways seems to produce the same re
sponse — a wild grab at the phone
with one hand, and the laccbook with
the other.
For most students who have gone to
the dance, though, Screw Your Sib
doesn't end up being an introdut tioti to
their future life partners.
"Screw Your Sib is pureh for fun,"
said sophomore Sarah llm. one ol five
big Sib/Lil Sib coordinators lor the
Asian-American New Student Orienta
tion Committee, which plans and spon
sors the dance. "It's a great time to dress
up, get to know other people and |iist
take a break from your t\pical Stanford
weekend."
At the beginning of the vcar, incom
ing freshmen and transfer students iu
the Asian communit\ are matched up
with upperclassmcn to form sib families,
llm explained.
"We sponsor events throughout the
year for sib families to hang out. and the
Strew Youi Sib tlatue is out biggest
event, as well as one of, il not the biggest
social events held In the Asian-Ainei k an
communit\ at Stanford," llm said.
I bis vear's dance, which organi/ers
have labeled "As N» rewed As li (.els,' w ill
In- held tomorrow night in N(an/anita
Dining Commons from 9 p.m. tt) I a.m.
"Planning the dance has been a de
lightful combination of fun and stress."
llm said. " I lie coordinators have put a

lot of work into this dance, and I am pos
itive that it's going to be the best Strew
Your Sib held so far."
I ppeit lassmen use several methods
to set up their little sibs, Ihn explained.
"Ilvou're one of 'those intense big sibs,
von scan the facebook during the first
week of school and pick out some ran
dom vet good-looking person and go
talk to them or their big sibs," she said.
"Some big sibs take requests from their
little sibs and go direct!) to talk to that
person or that person's big sib.
"big sibs ustialU go with friends or get
set upbytheii friends," she added.
I reshman l .ian Bloch's big sib set her
up with someone she already knows, so
she won't experience the blind-date as
pet t of the experience.
"Still, 1 think it w ill be fun," blot h said,
"from a mixed perspective, I think
it'll be a good opportunity to get to
know Stanford's Asian community for
the first time," said blot h, who is half
white, half-Asian.
"()ne aspect of the AANSOC dance
that I realh admire is that it is not exclu
si\el\ Ysian, and I'm hopefully antic ip.it
ing that it will be comfortable for evcrv
one in attendance, regardless of their
i at e." bloc h s.nd.
