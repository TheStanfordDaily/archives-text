ON IT the past two \ C.I! S. eiKTgA (or

concern foi Calilornians. Its high
c < >stand relative scarcit\ have led to
regional shortages, rolling blackouts and rad
ical overhaul plans tor the state's power grid.
lankily, we at Stanford have been shel
tered from the energ\ problems that main
others in the state have laced, because we
have our own on-site powet plant, the ( ardi
nal Cogeneration Kacilitv. we are protected
from this statewide problem. In fact, oui
generator produces so much power that we
are able to sell excess cnergv to the sur
rounding communities.
Nevertheless. Stanford has remained com
mitted to promoting cflic ient encrg\ use. An
excellent example is the I niversit\'s com
mitment to solar encrg\ —a renewable,
non-polluting souice hailed b\ businesses

and environmentalists alike as a future hope
for societ\ s energy needs.
Last summer. Stanford began building a
solai powei fac ilitv at the |asper Ridge field
station. 1 he fac ilit\. known as the Leslie S.
Sun l ielcl Station, will come with solar
panels lor electric its and an active water
heating s\stcm. Its estimated completion
elate is spi ing 200-.
While the c onstruc lion of the Jaspei Ridge
facilit\ is impressive and innovative, ecjualh
so is the initiative th.it Stanford students have
taken in promoting the use of environmen
tall\ lriendh power sources.
I he Stanford Solar Car Project is one of
the most successful such programs in the
countrv. It is nationally recognized for its
consistenth excellent performance in solar
cai races.
In |ulv. the Solai ("at Project entered two

cats in the American Solar Challenge race
from Chicago to Los Angeles. I his was the
first time in the event's history that any
group had entered more than one vehicle.
I he group brought home a silver medal in
the stot k (.n c ategory, after having worked
full-time for two years to build the vehicle.
In addition. Stanford students have made
strides to incorporate alternative energy use
into their daih lives. Members of the co-op
SvnergN have started a movement to install
solai panels in their residence.
Some students have worked with grass
roots en\ ironmental agencies in San Francis
co to disseminate information about a SIOO
million bond issue to promote solar and wind
cnergN inthecitv. I hat measure will be voted
on next l uesdav.
It should be expected that Stanford — a
world-renowned research institution with

top facilities, faculty and students — be a
leader in the field of alternative energy de
velopment as well as in general environmen
tal soundness.
Indeed, Stanford has taken steps to estab
lish itsell as a leader in these areas even
among comparable instil utions. For instance,
the I niversity has committed million for
energv-elficiencv improvement over the last
decade. In recent vears, it has spent many
thousands of dollars improving and expand
ing the Marguerite shuttle system, making
Stanford students. facult\ and employees less
dependent on private transportation.
We commend Stanford for establishing it
sell as a leader in the field of renewable
power sources. We look forward to seeing the
I niversity, its students and its faculty contin
ue to explore, develop and use alternative
sources of energy .
