Iranian responds to
Peikoff advertisement
Like main of readers, I was tleeph tlis
turlx'd l>\ the lull page advertisement
plat cd In the Avn Rand h (initiation inthe
()d. H) issue of I he Daily. Some have crit
ici/ed vour paper for publishing this ad
vertisement. Instead. I feel it is important
to bring ideas out in the open to discuss
them and their moral and prat tical impli
cations. As an Iranian. I do leel that hate
has motivated I eonard Peikoff to invest in
advertising his position in a large number
ol newspapers across the country.
But I also think that hateand ignorant e
are two sides ol the same coin and exist to
some degree in all of us. So I welcome the
c haute to openh discuss and evaluate the
various aspects of Peikoff" s ad. I believe
that we tan .ill clearly see the flaws in his
ideas with sufficient time and discussion.
In the ad, Peikoff, the head ol the Avn
Kami Foundation, advocates a I .S. attack
011 Iran "regardless of the countless inno
ccntscaught in the line of fire" to "take out
Iran." He clothes this extremism with a
well-crafted mix of facts and historical mis
representations to justifx his view.
It) address the many ways that
Peikoff's ideology has distorted his .ac
count of the formative history of the le
gion he targets would take many lengthy
essa\ s. Similarly, to discuss the real mean
ing of his dismissal of multiculturalism or
treatment of racism would be lengthy. I
find it ironic that Peikoff compares Irani
ans to Na/i fascists while he is advocating
what would amount to a "final solution,"
or mass murder, of an entire country's

population in order to solve the problem
ol terrorism, whit h he lot ates ext lusivch
in certain Midtlle F.astern peoples. In
stead, I briefh point to only one t)l the
i in pi it at ions ol Peikoffs solution.
11. as Peikofl suggests, we should pro
t eed \\ itli overwhelming forte with no re
gard to loss ol human lile in battling ter
rorism, then what distinguishes the ter
rorists from the battling forces? Isn't "tlis
regartl for human life" inherently part of
the definition of terrorism? Terrorists sac
rifice individuals' "lilt*, liberty and pursuit
ol happiness" to serve their own political
and ideological ends. I low are Peikoff s ar
guments am different when he claims that
millions of lives are dispensable?
Peikoff invokes self-defense to justih
his position. Is mass murder of an entire
nation going to make the L'nited States
an\ safer? First of all, it should be noted
that none of the Sept. 11 terrorists were
Iranian and the Iranian government has
vehemently condemned those murderous
actions, flow many millions of ordinary
Iranians should die because of the actions
of a small number of criminals who hap
pen tt) practice a related branch of Islam?
An analog)' would he to execute the peo
ple of a Protestant nation for the crimes of
a few ('.atholies.
Second, the likes of Osama bin Laden
justily their violence partly by drawing on
the suffering of war stricken innocent
Iraqi children, who have been dying in
massive numbers in the aftermath of the
Ciulf War.
I he likes of bin leaden justify their
crimes against innocent Americans in the
name of self-defense, analogous to

IVikoHs suggested nut hod ol self-de
fense. Adding to ilu* number of innocent
victims will onl\ tighten the grip of violent
extremists on the Middle lust. Willi the
escalation ol war, is IVikotl then going to
arivot ate "taking out" everv other country
in the region? I low many million Middle
Kasterners should die to eliminate the
threat of terrorism that can be perpetrat
ed by onl\ a handful ol psychologically de
ranged individuals?
IVikoll seems to know little about the di
verse ideologies, religions and social tac
tions within the Middle last and within
Iran. I le blames the diverse population of a
countn for the hostage-taking actions of
certain revolutionary zealots 20 years ago.
1 le maintains that Iranian civilians deserve
death lor f.tiling to overthrow extremists in
their government. Indeed, I'eikoff doesn't
seem to know much about life circum
stances in the countn he writes about, or he
would surely come to other conclusions.
Millions of Iranians who have lived
through revolutions and wars, and those
who continue to live under various politi
cal and economic constraints understand
that taking arms to overthrow govern
ments leads to massive bloodshed, chaos
and recurring cycles of violence. They
have experienced this firsthand.
Ordinary people who respect life try to
live peaceably and bring about c hange by
taking care of their families, helping their
neighbors ,mcl impac ting society positively
in their quiet ways. Unfortunately, these
millions of peaceful people don't make it to
the evening news, even though they have
