# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## End the policy of drug prohibition 
### T. CLARK DURANT GUEST COLUMNIST 
I louse Speaker Dennis I last en's 1 ecent revelation thai "Ilie
illegal drug trade is (lie financial engine that fuels mam ter
rorist organizations around the world," including Osama bin
Laden sa\s too little too late.
I lastert's dubious expansion on this bit. that "l>\ going after
the illegal di ug trade, we reduce the . il >i I it \ o! these terrorists to
launch attacks against the I nited States and other democra
cies," mistakes iause for ellei t. Il is because we have gone after
the drug trade that it is so profitable, and il is because we have
gone alter the drug trade that it is so lawless.
Prohibition deprives us of the al>ilil\ to regulate, tax or
even trat k the transai lions in an indusir\ that generates $400
billion in international trade. Moreover, markets made prof
itable l>\ prohibition breed violent competition, even it tliev
t ater to essentialh non-\ iolent consume! s.
Is our experience with the Prohibition's prolit-driven mob
violence so easil\ lorgotten? Il is drug law-enlbrcers, not drug
users, who effect i\el\ subsidize drug 11 alfu kei sand drug deal
ers. B\ extension, il is drug law enlbrt ers who effectively sub
sidize violence abroad and m our inner cities.
I he therein finam ialh well-off traffickers and dealers are
hard to bring to just it e. And when some big-time dealer or traf
ficker is indicted, it is without a significant bump in prices or
profit margins. Any nutubei of lieutenants are ready and will
ing to step into a leadership position, answering escalated po
lite pressure with ingenuit\ and innovation. Indeed, our for
mal Iv lineduiated minoritv youth exhibits all the initiative and
entrepreneurial instinct we demand ol business si liool gradu
ates, but in a lawless environment that pa\s them with some
combination ol soul-bought blood monev, jail time, and death.
Even so. it's not lot ked up drug dealers that overflow our pris
ons. B\ the wax. the politic i.ms will tell you, overflowing prisons
are proof that the I )rug War is being won. In fai I, starved of their
desired end (zero drug use) and curiously, blind to alternative
goals (like decreased drug abuse). the\ feet I their self-esteem with
the arrest, arraignment and int an ei ation of drug possessors. ( )l
these prisoners, disturbing amounts are non-violent offenders

locked in by mandatory minimums.
Moreover, (even taking into account the demography sol
tlrug use), we lock up disturbingly disproportionate amounts
of minorities.
Most of what we have been taught to think of as "the e\ ils of
Drugs" are actually the evils of Prohibition. Prohibition makes
drugs harder and less quality-controlled, and therefore more
dangerous. End prohibition and end death-bv-bathtub-gin
type overdoses.
Prohibition makes drugs more expensive to I»ii\ and more
profitable to sell. End prohibition and entl the impetus to
junkie crime and to trade and trafficking violence. Prohibition
in.ikes il harder for drug abusers to get help.
End prohibition and stop pretending that prison helps reha
bilitation, and more importantly: stop pretending that we're at
tually better off out here with our friends and fainih members
locked up.
What we need is a renewal of discussion and a rethinking ol
our drug policies. Why not experiment with legalization and its
four comely companions: regulation, taxation, edni ation and
rehabilitation? Instead of trying to spend awa\ th ug suppK.
why not recognize some kinds of drug demand as legitimate
and other kinds of drug demand as a medical problem?
Why not let those currently jailed as non-violent tlrug of
fenders become rehabilitating or rehabilitated taxpavet s? Win
not tax the drug trade to pay for (honest) ill ug eilui ation and
rehabilitation? Why not use law enforcement to prosecute
adults who make drugs available to minors, instead of adults
who make the choice to use drugs themselves? Win not use law
enforcement to prosecute thieves, rapists, murderers and ter
rorists instead of pot-smoking couch potatoes?
In these days of wars without clear and reasonable objec
tives, I cannot but suppose that as the world's remaining mi
perpower we are necessarily most vulnerable to mismanage
ment b\ our super selves. Let us not stand to sullei death l>\ a
thousand cuts when they can onlv be self-inllit ted.
