l ake one part inspired passing,
add a generous helping ol quarter
back pressure, garnish the recipe
with a dash ol last-second heroics
and the Huskies have leasted on
thc(.ardinal in 18ol theteams' last
20 meetings.
Yet in the last score ol 'games the
st,ikes may never haveheen highet
than thev will he tomorrow, when
No. 10 Stanford (5-1, 4-1 Pac-10)
takes on No. I I Washington (0-1,
*1-1) at 111isk\ Stadium, where the
Cardinal hasn't won since 1975.
F.ven in 1099, when no other
conference opponent could lincl
an antidote lor the Rose Bowl
hound ('ardinal, the I luskies used
a heavy dose ol quarterbacking
with Marques luiasosopo's .">07
yards in total offense to afflict Stan
ford with it's lone conference loss.
Then in last \ear's soggv contest at

Stanford Stadium, the I luskies en
gineered an 80-vard scoring drive
with 17 seconds remaining, heat
ing the (ardinal HI-28.
1 his season, midwav through
the l'ac-10 schedule, both teams
find themselves jumbled togethei
at the head of the conference
table in a five wa\ tie for first place
among the conference's once
beatens. I he winner ol this game
will establish itself as the confer
ence frontrunner to the I'iesta
Howl, while the loser will watch its
B( '.S bowl hopes disappear.
"All those games are historv."
Stanford senior defensive end
Marcus Hoover s.iid. "None of
that realK matters because this is
a different team."
But this vcar finds Washington
as talented as ever, and the
I luskiesc upboard seems to be well
stocked with the aforementioned
ingredients for suet ess.
Sophomore quarterback Cod\
1 *it kett has drawn more than oa .i
-sional comparisons with the plavei
he was( barged with replacing, the
graduated I uiasosopo, not just be
cause of his poise and athletic ism.
but also because of liin Hair for dra
matic fourth quartet comebacks.
Final quarter resurgences have
become the norm for this llusk\
