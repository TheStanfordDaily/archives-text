It was pretty much given heading into the Pa
cific 1 0 Conference season that one of either Stan
ford, Arizona, Southern California or I CIA
would win the conference title.
And with those teams i urrentiy ranked No. 3,
No. 4. No. 5 and No. «S, respectively, tli.it as
sumption is pretty much still in full forte.
1 lie formula for which of those teams would
win the Pac-10 has also pretty nun h been a given:
whichever team had the- best record against the
other three.
I lie stakes at hand are also well known: to
the Pac-10 champion likely goes the No. 1 seed
in the West Regional of the NCAA tournament

top s( liools, Arizona, currenth third in the con
ference at 10-3, looked like it would he the first to
be eliminated from contention.

hopes alive, while inadvertenth putting the ball
