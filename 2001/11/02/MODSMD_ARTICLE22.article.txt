Willi Stanford's credentials —
the No. t anking in the country, a
,'W-l game-record in its I 1 matches
against imranked opponents and
the Pacific 10 Conference's hest
blocking (.'$.71 blocks per game),
best .ill around player (junior out
side hitter Logan loin) and best
freshman (outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani) — it's a prett\ safe bet
that the\ will.
But tlu- members of the ('.ardinal
squad know better than that.
I lieonh reason the squad is un
defeated against unr.inked teams is
because they've taken tlieiu just as

So nevermind the Ducks' 0-11
record or the fact that the Heavers
have never beaten Stanford in
previous matches.
"Oregon's season isn't going

s.iid senior co-captain Michelle
Chambers. "Oregon State is sort

want it to be. We want to go up
there and make a statement that
we're reach to< onipete lor the na
