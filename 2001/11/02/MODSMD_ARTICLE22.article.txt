Tonight: No. 3 Stanford at
Oregon, 8 p.m., Eugene, OR
Tomorrow: No. 3 Stanford
vs. Oregon State, 7 p.m., Cor
vallis, OR

Willi Stanford's credentials —
the No. t anking in the country, a
,'W-l game-record in its I 1 matches
against imranked opponents and
the Pacific 10 Conference's hest
blocking (.'$.71 blocks per game),
best .ill around player (junior out
side hitter Logan loin) and best
freshman (outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani) — it's a prett\ safe bet
that the\ will.
But tlu- members of the ('.ardinal
squad know better than that.
I lieonh reason the squad is un
defeated against unr.inked teams is
because they've taken tlieiu just as
serious!) .is the five top-10 oppo
nents Stanford has faced this year.

So nevermind the Ducks' 0-11
record or the fact that the Heavers
have never beaten Stanford in
previous matches.
"Oregon's season isn't going
the was the\ want it to, and that
(.in give them a lot more motiva
tion to win, especially at home,"
s.iid senior co-captain Michelle
Chambers. "Oregon State is sort
ol in the same situation since their
record probably isn't where the\
want it to be. We want to go up
there and make a statement that
we're reach to< onipete lor the na
tional < hampionship."
I he (Cardinal lias a bit of extra
motivation heading into this
weekend, as I S( s loss to Arizona
last weekend put Stanford in the
driver's scat in the conference.
I lie Cardinal is guaranteed sole
possession of the conference
( row n if it wins all seven of its final
I'ac-10 matches.
"We have new opportunities
now heading into this weekend,
and we know it's up to us to c .ipit.il
i/e on those opportunities, said
Nnamaui, who leads all freshmen in
the Pac-1() in kills with 1171 per
game. " I hat's definiteh ex< ititig to
know that we're in control."
Nnamaui and loin have been
the backbone ol the Cardinal's at
t.H k all season, combining for S.iYl
