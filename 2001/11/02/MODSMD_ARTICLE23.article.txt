pressive .3-19-1 overall record against their Los
Angeles rival.
"I thought we were a little hit sluggish when we
played I CL\ the first time," said head coac h
Bret Simon. "I think that this was partly because
of I CIA's athleticism and partly a sign that we
need lobe mentally stronger. W e c an't lei mental
factors keep us from playing our best game. At
t'CLA, we couldn't find a way to win at a place

we've never won, which is ;i sign that we're not

Furthermore, the loss came alter a nine
game winning streak in the Cardinal's confer
ence opener which featured a tightly fought bat
tle that did not see a winner emerge until the
88th minute.

chance at UCLA and we're ready to get them
back. We just need to do the same thing we do.
We need to be sharp and have more intensity."

lot," Dunivant s;iid. "We've had some great home
games this year and hopefully this game will be
no exception. Fhe fans are always behind us.
