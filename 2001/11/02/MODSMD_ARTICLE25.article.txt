With only two weekends of play

WOMEN'S SOCCER
Tonight: No. 2 Stanford at Ari
zona State, 7 p.m., Tempe, AZ
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford at
Arizona, 1 1 a.m., Tucson, AZ

Hie l'at-10 is no longer up for
grabs. I lu re's no denying that Stan
lord is the team to heat right now.
I he loss In I CIA to unranked
()regon State last weekend not only
lifted Stanford to a higher national
ranking, it also shifted Pat:-10 con
trol into the (.animal's hands.
Stanford, now the only team un
defeated iu conference play, will
travel south to Arizona this weekend
in the driver's seat.
"It s amazing to he 5-0 in the Pac
10 beeause vou're in control of yout
own destiny, ' said junior forward
Marcia Wallis. "Von never have to
hope for .in upset."
I he (Cardinal will hit the road
lor its final conference road trip of
the season to pla\ Arizona State
tonight and the I niversity of Ari
zona on Suntlav.
Needless to say, it has been a sea
son of continuous improvements
for the ('.ardinal, who was picked bv
most polls to finish .i dismal lourth
plat e in the Pac-10.
My oh my, haven't times
i hanged.

Now, after lying then-No. 7 St.
Mary's (12-2-2) 0-0 last Friday and
beating then-No. 22 California (10-
5-1.2-3 Pat -10) last weekend on the
Farm, the Cardinal jumps up four
spots to its highest NS( 'A\ Adidas
ranking in st htxil history.
I bis Cardinal team is making
history. It'seaming respect the hard
way b\ taking on tough opponents
and winning hard-fought matches.
I his weekend Stanford will face
two scrappy Arizona teams that
have fallen on hard times as of late.
Arizona State (8-8, 2-4) split a
Pac-10 road weekend, winning at
Washington State 2-1 and losing to
No. Hi Washington 1-2.
Arizona (5-9-1, 2-4), on the
other hand, dropped two deci
sions to the Washington teams.
I hey lost last weekend 2-0 and 3-1
versus Washington and W ashing
ton State, respectivel\.
But Stanford isn't taking ei
ther of the Arizona teams lightly.
Practices this past week were in
tense, set oil i etui ning the (-ardi
nal to usual form.
"1 think we've got some work to
do in practices throughout the
week," said head coach Andy Nel
son. "I think we've got to go in and
work very hard in practice and play
cxtremel) hard in the games. No
one's going to give us a win."
Although last weekend's perfor
mances may have been sub-par,
ironically they tame during the
same weekend that the NSCAA/
Adidas national rankings decided
that Stanford deserved to move up.
"We have to put our old games
behind ns and realk focus on the
games ahead," said junior forward
Callie Withers. "I think being 5-0
just gives us more confidence."
