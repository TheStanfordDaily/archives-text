At most universities, the word "shopping"
evokes images of (iap hags. Ibod (ourts and ( redit
c ards. At Stanford, howcvei, "shopping" is not onl\
how students buy theii clothes: it is .ilso how thc\
select their e lasses.
Hut this \ear, the class selection process is slated to
undergo a major change before the start <>l spring
quarter. Stanford students w ho t ec rive some lorm ol

In the old Axess s\stein, students had to file a
commitment of registration for the following year.

since the "commitment process" is unique to Stan
