# ABC spells doom for football on TV

### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I o ilie chagrin of the Cardinal foot
ball faithful, AB(• Sports will stand by its
earlier decision to broadcast a game be
tween USC. and Oregon State tomor
row instead of the Stanford / W ashing
ton matchup. As a result, Stanford fans
will not be able to watch the game on
television.
With the Pacific 10 Conference lead
and a possible berth in the Fiesta Bow I at
stake, many at Stanford have expressed
outrage that ABC. will not be airing the
Stanford game.
But because of issues relating to its
contract with the Par-10 and a refusal by
the University of Washington to rest hed
ule, the network is obligated to instead
televise a game between two teams that

are unranked nationally and tied for
sixth in the Pac-10.
"I just can't grasp ABC's thinking,"
said freshman Kerik Hantsoo. "On the
one hand, you have two teams trying to
break a tie lot sixth place. On the other
hand you have two teams trying to break
a tie for first plate in the Pac-lOand vying
fora spot in the Fiesta Bowl.
"Wouldn't it be in ABC's best interests
to broadc .ist a game which dearly would
get more publicity?" he asked.
While ABC. would perhaps profit
more by broadcasting the Stanford
game, the fad that I SC. has scheduled its
contest with Oregon State as its home
coming game makes it impossible for the
network to do so.
I he deal that gives ABC and Fox
Sports Net exclusive broadcasting rights
to all Pac-10 games requires that the

networks decide fat in advatue whether
or not to broadcast schools' homecom
ing games.
"It is the wish of every school in the
Pac-10 that homecoming games be
picked in advance." s.iid Asst. Athletic Di
rector fot Media Relations Can Migdol.
With all of the planning that goes into
homecoming, schools need to know at
what times theii games will be broadcast,
Migdol said.
If homecoming games were treated
like regulat games — which broadcast
ers generally (boose within a week of
game day — the kick-ofl times would
sometimes be < hanged on shot t notice to
accommodate IV schedules, which
could complicate the planning of home
coming events.
