Students are vulnerable to
a variety of aches and
pains, which are often caused
by overexertion. Here are
some common ones:
Strain: A slightly overstretched
muscle, tendon or ligament.
Sprain: Torn or overstretched
liga-ments around a joint.
Tendonitis: Overuse or injury
of tendons, causing pain,
tenderness, and inflammation.
Tennis elbow: A type of
tendonitis. The pain is on the
outer side of the elbow, where
the tendons that bend the
wrist back are attached.
Knee Problems:
Patellar tendonitis (jumper's
knee) - an inflammation of the
tendon that attaches the knee
cap to the shin bone. This causes
pain below the knee cap that
worsens with jumping or
squatting.
Patellar femoral syndrome - an
inflammation on the back side of
the knee cap. This causes a deep
achey pain in the knee cap that
worsens with walking up and
down stairs or prolonged sitting
with bent knees.
Muscle Cramps: May occur
during exercise (esp. in hot
weather), or at night.
Charley Horse: Muscle cramp in
leg. Possible causes: an
unstretched muscle prior to
workout, dehydration, or low
level of potassium (eat more
bananas, potatoes, and oranges).
Shin Splints: General phrase for
shin pain. Usually caused by
overuse or a change in routine

Team undoubtedly had their
share of aches and pains, but
ice was harder to come by then.
(new shoes, jogging on a different
surface, running down hill).
Stress fracture: A small crack
in a bone caused by overuse.
Often in the foot or shin.
Results in pain and tender
ness; increases with use. May
be no visible swelling. More
likely in women whose
periods have stopped.
What to Do
■ Take ibuprofen or naproxen
to help ease pains and
inflammation
■ Remember "RICE" for
aches, pains, and injuries
(Rest, Ice, Compression,
Elevation)
Rest is critical. Pain is your
friend! Let pain be your guide
- if it hurts, don't do it. When
initial pain and swelling are
gone, slowly resume exercise
of injured area. If it hurts, stop
and rest more.
Ice: Reduces pain, swelling, and
promotes healing. Apply 10
minutes every hour for the first
tew days (not directly on skin);
then 15 to 20 minutes three
times a day and after exercise.
Compression: Use an Ace
bandage or compression sleeve
to immobilize and compress
injured area (wrap it tight
enough to feel tension without
cutting off circulation).
Elevation: To minimize swelling,
keep hurt area at or above your
heart level whenever you sit or
lie down.
Avoiding Aches and
Pains
■ Warm up before exercising;
cool down and stretch after
(cold, stiff muscles are more
susceptible to injury)
■ Increase intensity and
duration of physical activity
gradually
■ Alternate harder and easier
workouts
■ At the first twinges of pain,
reduce your physical activities
■ Wear supportive, well
cushioned shoes for running,
walking, and aerobics
■ Tennis: Use a two-handed
back stroke
■ Biking: Get the seat and
handle bars adjusted for you
■ Roller-skating: Wear pads
■ Don't stop exercising if you
have an injury - just choose
something that doesn't hurt
