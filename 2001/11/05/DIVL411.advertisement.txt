Red Cross Relief Fund
United We Stand
Stanford Federal Credit Union established a disaster relief fund for those affected by our recent national tragedy.
SFCU collected $12,326.25 from the Stanford Community and added $10,000 to your contributions. All donations were
delivered to the American Red Cross for the National Disaster Relief Fund.
John R Davis, SFCU President/CEO, said that the Credit Union filled a logical role as the expediters and administra
tors of a disaster relief fund designed to make it easy for members of the Stanford Community to contribute to this
massive relief effort. "We accepted and passed along all contributions regardless of amount," Davis explained.
"The Red Cross is about saving lives," said Davis."And the Credit Union is about people helping people. We knew
there were a lot of people who wanted to give, and we wanted to make giving simple." Thanks to all who made this
donation possible.

Genie's Wish for
Lower Car Payment
Granted
"Finally! Someone grants m_y wish!
■
Boh the Genie lias been granting
wishes for the last 10,000 years. Now,
it's his turn to have his wish granted,
thanks to Stanford FCU's limited time,
auto refinancing deal.
Hob the Genie refinanced his loan
from another lender with SFCU and
got a big-time bonus —lower car
payments AND a $ 100 rebate. Now
you can do the same!
Until December 31,2001, you too
can reap the rewards of saving money.
Just drop by any SFCU Service Center
and tell them how much you owe on
your current loan. If SFCU can reduce
your payments by refinancing, they
will pay you a $ 100 bonus just for
refinancing the loan through SFCU.
"I finally had my carpet, I mean
car, adjusted perfectly. I didn't want a
new one, just a lower payment. It was
a magical moment for me," says Bob.
"Now I am the master of my pay
ments —and with the extra hundred
bucks, I updated my bottle."
Take advantage of this offer soon.
It ends December 31, 2001.

Red Cross Relief Fund
United We Stand
Stanford Federal Credit Union established a disaster relief fund for those affected by our recent national tragedy.
SFCU collected $12,326.25 from the Stanford Community and added $10,000 to your contributions. All donations were
delivered to the American Red Cross for the National Disaster Relief Fund.
John R Davis, SFCU President/CEO, said that the Credit Union filled a logical role as the expediters and administra
tors of a disaster relief fund designed to make it easy for members of the Stanford Community to contribute to this
massive relief effort. "We accepted and passed along all contributions regardless of amount," Davis explained.
"The Red Cross is about saving lives," said Davis."And the Credit Union is about people helping people. We knew
there were a lot of people who wanted to give, and we wanted to make giving simple." Thanks to all who made this
donation possible.
