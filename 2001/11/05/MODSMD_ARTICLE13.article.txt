Stanford University hospital is pio
neering the testing of a new system to
monitor the symptoms of patients
brought to emergeney rooms, in an ef
fort to gain early wanting of possible
biologieal attaeks.
The system — dubbed Biothreat Ac
tive Surveillance Integrated Informa
tion and Communication System, or
HASIICS — was dei>eloped by Moun
tain View, Calif -based Health Hero
Network and could be in place in hos
pitals across Santa Clara County by
the end of the month, officials said.
The system places a simple Jour
button device at admission stations,
allowing hospital staff to immediately
input data on symptoms.
That information is transmitted to
an off-site data center where doctors,
researchers or government agencies
can analyze the broader, regional pic
ture for early signs of unusually wide
spread incidence of specific symptoms.
Public health experts say such sys
tems would be a significant improve
ment over existing symptom-surveil
lance programs.
