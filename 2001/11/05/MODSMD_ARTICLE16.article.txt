### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” More U.S.
special forces entered Afghanistan to
support anti-Taliban rebels as top com
manders said yesterday the 1 aliban gov
ernment is weakening but Mill controls
substantial troops that will take time to
thin out and conquer.
"We 're setting in lor the long haul,"
said Air Force Gen. Richard Myers,
chairman of the Joint ( liiels of Stall.
"We are going to continue to resup
ply" the anti-Taliban lighters of the
opposition northern alliance "right
through the winter." Myers said. "We
think that they have every chance ol
prevailing."
1 he general said a couple more
teams of special forces were inserted in
Afghanistan the last few days. Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said last
week he hoped to at least triple the
number of spec ial forces inside
Afghanistan, now believed to number
between 100 and 200.
Fhe teams are working with opposi
tion leaders and"the more teams we
get on the ground, the more effectively
we'll bring air power to bear on the Tal
iban lines," Mvcrs said on NBC I's "Meet
the Press."

Ihe loams art* likely to include (ireen
Berets, U.S. Army commandos who spe
cialize in advising foreign troops. Special
forces on the ground can also find hid
den targets lot I S. aiistrikes.
I lie Pentagon said yesterday th.it
I S. bombing over the weekend Ibcused
on targets close to lour ke\ cities near
the Taliban front lines with northern al
ii.nice rebels: Bagrani, l alocjan, kon
duz and Mazar-e-Sharif.
I he northern alliance claims to
have launched a major ollensive near
Mazar-e-Sharil. ('apt tire of that c it \ In
anti-Taliban forces would open a
major supply route from I zbekistan
and lajikistan.
In Pakistan, Defense Secretary Don
ald 11. Rumsfeld said that four weeks of
U.S. bombing have weakened the lal
iban's ability to operate as a government.
1 he* Taliban are "using their power
in enclaves throughout the countn t<>
impose their will on the Afghan peo
ple," but are not making "major mili
tary moves," Rumsfeld said. "The Tal
iban |are| not really functioning as a
government."
Myers and Army Gen. Pommy
Franks, commander of I .S. forces in the

war, declined to sa\ whether it would
i.ike ama jor dcplo\ ment of U.S. ground
troops to topple the Taliban.
President Bush indicated last week
the campaign would not ease during
Ramadan. " I he enemy won't rest
during Ramadan and neither will
we," he said.
Members ol Congress said it is too
early to tell how long the war will last
or whether more ground troops will
be needed.
"I think out enemies, the more
thev're convinced that we're in this for
the long haul, the shorter this thing"
max last, said Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) 011 "Fox News Sunday."
Added Democratic Sen. Joseph
Biden of Delaware, the Foreign Rela
tions Conunitteechairman: "It may very
well be that as things move on." admin
istration officials "have to insert, or at
least contemplate, a larger infusion of
ground forces."
Joining Biden on (IBS' "Face the
Nation," Sen. Chuck Ilagel (R-Neb.)
said. "1 don't see where you're going to
put a half a million men on the ground
like we did in Vietnam or any of the
large-scale efforts."
