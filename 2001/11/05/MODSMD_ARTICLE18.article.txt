## The 						Stanford Daily New registration policy is not a major hindrance 
### 
Published Since IS ( )I

Starting spring quarter, Stanford stu
dents who receive financial aid w ill he
required to pre-register for at least 12
units the day before the term ends.
I his (liange, wliic li was made necessary by
the new \\css system, has raised concerns
that pre-registration would lead to the
death of the shopping period. Additionally,
ii led some members of the community to
believe that I'niversity policy was deliber
ate!) singling out limineial aid recipients
I he polic \ is required by federal regula
tions lor the distribution of financial aid,
which require the I niversitv to prove that
students are enrolled and registered for
< lasses. Ihe old Axess program required
students to file a registration commitment
foi the year.

At first glance, the policy does seem to
threaten the shopping period by forcing
students to sign up for classes and unfairly
target financial aid recipients by limiting
their ability to sign up for classes early.
It's understandable that students are
concerned with retaining the shopping pe
riod. Being able to sample course materials
and teaching styles in the first weeks of the
quarter is one of the major benefits of at
tending Stanford. Instead of waking up at 6
a.m. to desperately attempt to register for
c lasses by phone or computer, we can at
tend several classes in one clay and finalize
our schedules later. I he shopping period,
while overwhelming with choices, is a rela
tively unique and beloved institution.
Worries that pre-registration will lead to

the death of the shopping period are un
founded. Students will still be free to ex
ploit' as many classes as they want to visit.
I here is nothing binding them to the classes
or units they chose, so financial aid recipients
have the same freedom as other students re
garding class choice. The most important as
pect of the shopping period is the add / drop
deadline, which remains the same.
University Registrar Roger Printup has
said that the new policy will not ask students
to nail down classes ahead of time, and that
all students will still enjoy the freedom to
add and drop as much as they wish.
I he ac tual impact of the new policy is
minimal. Instead of filing a registration
commitment for the following year, stu
dents must pre-register. I his act does not

require a significant increase in time or effort.
True, any University policy that held fi
nancial aid recipients to a different stan
dard than non financial aid recipients
would be patently unfair.
In addition, any policy which impinged
upon the academic freedom that we cherish
at this University — to shop classes, to add,
to drop and to elect or unelect the credit /
no credit grading option relatively late in
the quarter — would be rightly seen by the
student body as unnecessarily draconian.
It is important that members of this com
munity realize that the new Axess policy is
neither of these. Therefore, in no signifi
cant way does it change academic life for
any group of Stanford students and needs
not be feared.
