I tins, within seconds ol pressing the
payment option, I was speaking with
I i'i 1 v, a Spi nit ( aistomcr (iarc represen

in the mail and asked him il he could thus
turn m\ ser\ u e ha< k on.
I lis reph ? "Well, a< tualh. Mr. Morgan,
I'm looking .it \<>ui records here and I see
that you've broken a lot ol voui promises
with Sprint PC.Sin the past, so we're not
going to turn on voui serviie with just all
ot liei hollow promise ot yours to pay. L tit il
we receive payment in the mail, we're not
going restore your service."'
Ilollow promise? l -l)ogg. how Machi
avellian and hosiv ol vou. I'll he happy to
mail von a payment. Laced with anthrax*
It's time to pull the curtain hack. Sprint
PCS is an amorphous villain with many
laces. ()ne of these identities is satanii. All
things considered. I truly do have a Faus
tian p.K 1 with Sprint P( S. Hat gaining with
them is bargaining wit 11 the devil, because
Sprint P( S is bad. it is übiquitous, it is om
niscient. 11 is uuti listing and it is very,
verv tempting 111 what il oilers me. I
signed a contract that binds me to a lull
ve.ll with them. A lull year? Il might as
well be tnv soul.
It (.111 also he argued that Sprint PC.S
possesses characteristics reminiscent ol
Shvlock in Shakespeare's "'llie Merchant
of Venice." Shvlock stipulated that a
pound ol flesh be exa< ted from Antonio, a
men bant who defaults on his loan. When
I did not pay mv bill on time, Sprint an
swered with similar dramatic retaliation.
| ust as Shykx k accepted no compromise
and demanded that Antonio barter with

Perhaps Sprint Pi S should he based in
Washington, I).( Ihe ( aistoiner ( are di
vision is so obese with bureaucracy and
overlapping responsibility that erasing an
liiijusi charge from m\ hill (a moniliK af
fair) requires adroit manipulation ol the
organizational frav. |ust as a congress

(la re-turf.
Sprint should also he in the tapit.il be
taiise it is basit alb letleral in its national
presence. Sadlv, its network is more per
vasive than the ( lAs has recently proven
to be.
\t least the Sprint PCS store on I'niver
sit\ \\e. is well run. well designed and the
representatives are all competent. Oh,
wait. 1 think that the wicked, duplicitous
nature of Sprint P( IS is wearing oil on me
in unforeseen wavs. For example, my new
fetish is screening calls from even my best
ft ientls. I o me, the only thing better than
getting a phone call is screening a phone
call. It endows the streener with a pro
found sense ol social worth and pads his
burgeoning ego. ('.ertainly, the fact that mv
dirty courtship with Sprint PC IS has taught
me such vainglorious tactics is reason
enough to abhor it.
I mil my check arrives at the fiery gates
of Sprint PCS I leadquarters, I w ill be cor
responding fecklessly from the telephone
in in\ room. Hut when mv vear contract
has been fulfilled, I will divorce Sprint PCS
forever. I 'wo thousand minutes of cellular
each month is not worth being in the pock
et of an imperialistic, unscrupulous and
pitiless partner.

llnd Morgan hopes to see Sprint PCS at the
next career fair. And even on his land line, l/ud
will continue to screen your calls, so why not
just entail him at hniorgan@stanford.edu.
