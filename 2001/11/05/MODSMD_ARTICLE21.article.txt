Questioning the U.S. military's role in
Afghanistan
11 seems like every anii-war piece pub
lished in the Daily is followed bv multiple
numbers of anti-peace — er, pieces.
These pro-war writers make <i compelling
case, especially when they manage to con
found "pro-war" with "pro-American,"
"pro-freedom," or in Mark Singer's case,
"pro-life." Then again, these (overwhelm
ingly male) letter-writers are simply offer
ing wordier versions of the arguments
that we hear every night on the news. I
applaud their participation in the cam
pus debate, but let's not forget that
speaking up for the majority requires
very little courage.
1 am for peace, but I definitely do not
want to die, and prolonging this war is a
sure-fire way to get us all killed. At the
same time, wanting peace does not equal
wanting to sit around on our collective
butt waiting for the suicide bombers. 1 am
no apologist. I want bin Laden and his
supporters to be brought to justice. 1 low
ever, I do not believe the U.S. should
trample over international law and civil
liberties in an attempt to do so, even
though the terrorists did it first.
We need to take the moral high
ground if we want to be the good guys —
and we had the moral high ground until
we started bombing.
Limited military action is unavoidable.
But why, why must civilians get killed de
liberately? The U.S. military is unparal
leled worldwide for its humanitarian slant
and its technical competence. It does not
make mistakes. But claiming ignorance is
a helluva lot easier than justifying collat
eral damage. Of course, we could have
limited ourselves early on to just sending
in Special Forces, thereby preventing a lot

ol that collateral damage — you don't
need to blow up anti-aircraft guns il
you're not going in on planes.
rhese days many people feel uncom
fortable when I .S. policy blunders are
brought up. But, though the U.S. is per
haps the most benevolent superpower to
ever exist, we still make mistakes, and
thinking people have always questioned
I S. foreign policy. W'liv does out contin
uing to do so now make us somehow jus
tifiers of terrorism? The government
would like nothing better than to quiet in
formed dissent, and we should not let
them use national tragedy as an excuse to
do so. After all, freedom c an only endure
alongside dialogue and democracy.

The pool, crying and the war in
Afghanistan
I never cry. So that is a slight exagger
ation. I cry maybe once or twice a year
when all the emotions of change, growth,
and death surface. I'm not sure why I
never cry. I think it has to do with a lot of
tilings. My sisters and my mom cry con
stantly. It could he over anything; a favorite
song in church, a sappy movie at the the
ater, even burnt toast. Ilieir whim to cry,
along with my resolve to be strong and in
dependent has convinced me not to cry.
Yet, this morning while swimming in the
aqua refuge of Avery pool, I cried. Ilie
stress of midterms, insufficient sleep and my
lack of romantic interests are all reasons to
cry. Yet, none of these reasons have ever
caused me to cry before, so why now?
The "war on terrorism" has finally hit

me. I now I am trying. I was vacationing in
.1 remote village on the Greek Pelopon
nesian ('.oast, a plate a close friend of mine
from Stanford calls home, when the 1 win
lowers crumbled. I was completely re
moved from the chaos, the shock, and fear
in the I nitetl States. Mv mom called to see
it 1 was alright and I laughed. "Mom, what
is the big deal?" 1 said. "Of course, my
thoughts .ind prayers are with the people of
New York, but millions of innocent c ivilians
die even year in civil strife in Africa. No one
seems to care about them." Our conversa
tion was brief, and I headed back to the
quiet magic of the nearby pebble Ix'ach.
1 wo months later I realize this is a big
deal. 1 listen to Nl'R every chance 1 get. I
buy the New York limes, even on Sunday
when it costs five dollars, live dollars is a lot
fora college student to spend on anything,
even beer. I seek true examination, analysis
and thought on what is occurring. I need
something beyond the flashy images and
repeated empty statements given by the
news channels. I now I am confused. I am
scared. 1 am crying.
1 cry for the village of Chowkar-Karez
that was almost flattened by American
bombers. I cry for the hopeless, destitute
Arabs who enlist in terrorist organizations
localise they see no hope beyond the tragic
slums in cities like Cairo, Jeddah, and Is
lamabad. 1 cry for .American and British sol
diers who are venturing into unknown ter
ritory and hidden danger. I cry even for my
mom, who usually does the crying for me.
She fears threats of continued terrorist at
tacks, the safety of her family and the world
that her daughters are now inheriting.
What kind of world are we inheriting? A
world where violence begets more vio
lence. A world where alliances are made not
