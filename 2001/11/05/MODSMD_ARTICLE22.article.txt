# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Band absence at Husky Stadium felt by players and fans 
### AARON LEVINE GUEST COLUMNIST 
SEA'I 111-—Whenever the Stanford
football team scored ,i loin hdown on Sat
urday, the ( ardinal fans in the northwest
corner ol 111isk\ Stadium cheered as loud
as they could.
But they did it without .1 hand, without
a mascot and without the beloved sound ol
"All Right Now."'
Frankly, as part ol the ( '.ardinal contin
gent that spent the money and energy to
support Stanford In traveling to Washing
ton, 1 believe that the absente ol the Band
is inexcusable, and I've ncvet been more
frustrated.
In one of the most crucial regular-sea
son road games that I <an remember,
given the Cardinal's position in the na

tional rankings and the Pacific lOConler
ence race, I cannot believe that Stanford
did not opt to send its band to help hype
the fans and the team.
1 here is no question that because of the
Band's absence, the cheers were shorter
after each score, the rhythmic clapping
was almost nil and main of our fans had
retaken their seats before place kicker
Mike Biselli had punched the extra point
through the uprights. Bv the- time of the
ensuing kickolf, that adrenaline rush,
which is so important in football, was an
cient history.
fo add insult to injury, not only did 1
hear the question ol "Where is our band?''
(ountless times from the fans around me,
the purple-clad llusk\ fans also mocked
us bv asking if our free was too scared to
show up.

So why wasn't the Band there and
where was our free?
Assoc. Athletic Director Darrin Nelson,
who is usually in charge of deciding
whether or not the band can travel to road
games, was unavailable lor comment on
Sunday. But Band members said that
there were a couple of reasons for the
Band's absence.
First of all, because Stanford had al
readv funded trips to Oregon and I SC,
there wasn't enough money to send an
entire band on a plane to Seattle.
1 hat's absolutely crazy, l o say that
the most dominant athletic program in
the country — not to mention one of
the wealthiest schools in the country —
could not afford to send a band to a
football game is atrocious.
Secondly, the Washington athletic

department was timid about allowing
the Band to come to the game because
of its Kurt Cobain halltime tribute show
in 1995.
Yet it had never banned the Band like
Notre Dame has and ()regon did until this
year. I'm sure that most opposing athletic
departments are usually "timid," but Stan
ford could have compromised the way it
did in at the Coliseum in September when
the Band was limited to the stands without
a halltime show.
"It was painful to not be there," a Band
member said. "The Band is behind the
football team as mm h as anybody."
I hat feeling works both ways. Accord
ing to a couple players on the team, speak
ing on the condition of anonymity, the
Band does have a genuine effect in lifting
the spirits of the players and building

adrenaline when they store a touch
down. I hat might have helped when the
( lardinal tied the score at 2S in the fourth
quarter. But regardless of what it might
have accomplished, it's the principle of
the matter that's important.
I applaud the nine band members w ho
sported their outfits in the stands on Sat -
urday and who had driven 13 hours just
to be there. I 'hat's certainly dedication.
1 object, however, to the fact that they
couldn't bring instruments with them.
Personally, 1 can't put into words how
much I would have given to hear a laint
ring from a painted tuba, to see the glim
mer of a silver Dollie pompom or to
watch the free skip along the track in
front of us.
It was disappointing and infuriating to
not have been given that satisfaction.
