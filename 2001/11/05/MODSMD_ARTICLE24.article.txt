Beaten, hi 11ist-t I and battered, I lie C Car
dinal hobbled out of I lnsk\ Stadium after
a devastating 42-28 defeat.
Faint smells of roses now reek like the
stench of missed opportunities.
An imminent fiesta now seems
pooped.
Yet, underneath the Washington
gloom, realizations of a budding Cardi
nal future lli( ker brightly.
fhe mere fact that this loss ended
Stanford's outside t ham e fora Nation
al Championship shows how much
Coach Tyrone Willinghatn's program
has progressed.

Step back, take a
deep breath and ponder
when Stanford and na

peared together in the
same column.
It may soon be com
monplace, like the palm
trees that line Stanford's
entrance.

Luckily, Stanford has an athletic di
rector who understands that a coach
needs about five years to begin to put his
stamp on the football program, especial
l\ .it a s< liool where athletes also must be
students.
Like fine wine, programs need to wait
until their talents age and mature.

Willinghatn and his stall are current
ly on the cusp of national prominence,
developing a s\stein where talented
plavers continue to he replenished b\
high-profile ret ruits i oniing in tin ougli
revolving doors.
I lie Cardinal will have a lot more
depth soon, but the future needed to ar
rive sooner Saturday, when Stanford's
lack of depth made it a wounded, blood
ied prey in the 1 luskies' lair.
When Stanford is healthy, its starters
( an compete with an\ team in the nation.
But unlike Miami or Nebraska, Stanford
doesn't have the luxury of having two
high st hool All-Anierit ans bat king up at
every position.
With a healthy Kern Carter, per

haps Stanford converts the two fumbles
it recovered in Husk\ territory into
tout hdowns.
With a health) Matt Leonard and
I re\ Freeman, perhaps Stanford suit idl

With a healthy Ryan Fernandez, per
haps Stanford's secondan doesn't allow
so main huge pass completions.
Amidst the chant it loss, though,
Stanford's future stars sparkled while
other potential!) great players watched
and learned.
Wide receiver l evo Johnson showed
that he max become an offensive |ulius
Peppers.
With his size, speed and leaping abili
