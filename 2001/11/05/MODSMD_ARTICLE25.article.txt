MEN'S SOCCER
Friday: No. 4 Stanford 0, UCLA 0

fhe tie.due in no part to a lack of scoring
chances bv either team, was the Cardinal s first
of the season, and despite keeping the team in
first place in the Pacific 10 Conference, it nar
rowed its margin of lead. It kept Stanford un
defeated at home, bringing the Cardinal's final
record at New Maloney to 8-0-1.
I he finish was also a step in the right direc
tion for Stanford (13-1-1, 3-1-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) against a tough LCLA team (7-6-4, 3-
2-1) that had defeated the Cardinal 2-1 earlier
in the season at Los Angeles.
"We played a better game this time, but
UCLA is still a very difficult team to play," said
head coach Bret Simon. "They have found a
style that they're comfortable with, have a lot of
young plavers who are starting to mature and
have a great defense. 1 hey are hard to crack.
fhe Cardinal remained perfect on campus
behind the screaming and yelling of a new
group of students calling themselves the
Hooligans. Making its first unified appear
ance, the group stood behind the visitor s goal
wearing shirts with the number "I embla
zoned on the back.
These spirited fans got all that they could ask

for in the bat k-and-forth battle.
In the first half, UCLA had a shot that ap
peared as if it would find the back of the net be
fore hitting the crossbar and bouncing back
onto the field harmlessly.
The Cardinal saw even more chances to
score in the second half as it outshot the Bruins
7-2. but it was unable to get anything tin the
board. It was again the Cardinal with most of
the chances in overtime.
In the closing minutes of the game, over 117
minutes after the opening whistle, Stanford ju

nior Roger Levesque squared up from the top
of the box and sent a solid shot towards the
UCLA goal.

game, the ball missed In inches, striking the
side post and bouncing away, fhe Cardinal
then had two more great chances, with one of
these shots bouncing off a Bruin defender
