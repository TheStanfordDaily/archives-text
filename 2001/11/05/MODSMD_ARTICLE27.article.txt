a 5-0 rout.
I lie atmosphere of the game against Arizona State
was tense from the very beginning. Ihe raucous
crowd seemed poised and ready to watch its team
upset the liighlv ranked (Cardinal.
After 90 minutes of exciting regulation play that
saw neither team find the back of the net, the two
teams entered overtime. I lie stalemate ended in the

1 lie loss came as a big blow to Stanford, which had
just claimed sole possession of'first place in the l'ac-10
last weekend. The Cardinal had also traveled to Ari
zona State boasting it's highest NSCAA / Adidas rank
ing in school history after the No. 3U( lost to un
ranked Oregon State.
What the Cardinal could not have imagined enter
ing Friday's game was that it was soon to follow in the
Bruins' footsteps â€” losing to an unranked team and
placing the l'ac-10 title up for grabs.
"No one can be underestimated in this confer
ence," said head coach Andy Nelson. "On any given
night any team is capable of winning a game. We can't
take anyone lightly."
Against Arizona State on Friday, Stanford strug
gled offensively. I he (Cardinal wasoutshot by the Sun
Devils 13-10 while sophomore scoring sensation Mar
c ie Ward wasn't allowed a single shot on goal. Stan
lord was simply unable to capitalize on its offensive
opportunities.
()n Sunday, however, this was not the case. Against
Arizona, Stanford had a much stronger showing.
I he Cardinal got off to an early start against the
Wildcats. Sophomore forward Robyn dell ay scored
in the 36th minute of pla\ and was followed closely by
a score from freshman forward Katie Wavland in the
39th minute.
Wavland would finish the game with two goals, her
second coming in the second half oil of an unassisted
shot from 15 yards back.
Scoring duo Ward and junior forward Man ia Wal

handed. Both would add points to the scoreboard in
the second half, scoring within minutes of each other.

Saner, recorded its fifth shutout of the year.

"We try to leave past games in the past and focus on
what's ahead," Wallis said. Fhe truth is what's done is
done, and if Stanford wants to have any c hance at
c laiming the l'ac-10 title that is now up for grabs, the
(-ardinal will have to focus all attention on this week
end's conference deciding matchups against US(and
UCLA.
