Stanford's Office of I ndergradu
ate Admission extended until

sion deadline foi applicants affect
ed In mail problems.
I he office has encouraged stu
dents who are concerned about
the receipt of applications alread)
mailed to fax a cop\ of them, and
have advised college counselors
and teac hers to fax recommenda
tion letters and transc i ipts.
Admissions officials said thev
w ill pure base more fax mac bines in
anticipation of theit inc leased use.
Dean of I ndergracluate Ad
mission ,ind financial Aid Kobin
Mamlet emphasized that appli
cants should not be overh con
cerned about the clela\s.
"We are anticipating that the
mail will be much slower," she said.

"As long as applications arc post
marked by the deadlines, they
should be okay."
Although the number of elec
tronic applications has increased
this year, Mamlet was hesitant to
attribute this change to concerns
about the mail delays.
"We've been really pushing elec
tronic applications, so it's hard to
sa\ that this is a direct consequence
of the anthrax scare," she said.
()ther universities across the na
tion have taken similar steps to deal
with the mail problems. I he Mass
achusetts Institute of Technology,
Princeton and Yale, among others,
have posted messages on their Web
sites stating that thev will be flexible
about the deadline and receipt of
applications.
Princeton, which suspended
campus mail delivery fora few
days last week, has asked appli
cants who sent their applications
recently to lax them to the univer
sity as well.

If there is Â«i serious delay in the
receipt of early decision applica
tions, it could .ilm) have an effect on
how quickh university admissions
offices make their decisions.

answers by 1 )ec. 12 to Dec. 15,'Kric

ate admissions at Columbia Uni
versity, told I he New York limes.
If there are clela\ s, "we might have
to have a few more days."

delavs in the San Franc isco area.
"I can't speak about every as
pect of the student application
process, but as far as mail goes,

applications should be delivered
on time," said I SI'S spokesman

Similarly, mam West ('.oast ap
plicants remain coinpleteh oblivi
ous to the mail problems.
"I hadn't thought about mail
delays at all," said Xohreen
Aclamjee, a high school senior in
Torrance, Calif., currently in

volvecl in the college application
process.
Despite all the changes, M.unlet
s.iul she would sii 11 not label am of
the measures as actual alterations
to Stanford's application policy.
"We're onl\ providing addi
