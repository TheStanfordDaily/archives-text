## Medical officials institute a task force in response to anthrax 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
l op Stanford medical offi
cials have finalized a Bioterror
ism and Emergency Prepared
ness Task Force in response to
the spread of anthrax on the
East ("oast.
The task force, assembled
by the dean of the School of
Medicine and the chief execu
tive officers of Stanford I lospi
tal and Clinics and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital,
will be chaired by I)r. Eric A.
Weiss, assistant professor of
surgery (emergency medicine)
and Lou Saksen, vice president
of general services at the Med
ical Center.
"We want to ensure that the
Medical (Center and communi
ty [have] adequate policies,
procedures and resources in
place to respond to bioterror
ism." Weiss said.
"It wasn't until recently that
we felt there was an increased
need for this kind of prepara
tion," he continued.
The response plan con
structed by the task force in
cludes procedures for han
dling and treating patients

who may have been exposed to
anthrax and limiting potential
exposure of others within the
hospital.
Furthermore, it contains
measures for ensuring that
doc tors and nurses have all the
information and resources
necessary to successfully un
dertake these goals.
" I'hese infections can be
very difficult to diagnose,"
Weiss said, explaining that
symptoms can parallel those of
the common flu virus.
"We are developing clini
cal pathways which will guide
physicians with how to recog
nize and treat patients who
display symptoms related to
bioterrorism . . . [and] we are
training them to have a high
er index of suspicion," he
continued.
In his Oct. 29 newsletter to
the Medical Center communi
ty, Medical School Dean Dr.
Philip A. Pizzo stressed the ur
gency of the plan, as well as
features he deemed necessary.
"Reducing the incidence of
transmission of infectious
agents such as plague, small
pox and viral hemorrhagic
fevers to staff, patients and the
community will depend on
how rapidly victims, including
the worried-well, can be
triaged, diagnosed, isolated

when necessary and treated,"
Pi/.zo wrote.
"Early communication with
the local health departments
will be essential in controlling
or preventing disease transmis
sion and providing public assur
ance," he added.
Weiss said that the group will
coordinate its efforts with federal,
state, county and local agencies.

he said. "A lot of smart people are
contributing."
fhe plan is also two-pronged.
According to the Stanford Re
port, "One plan outlines a
method for managing individual
patients who may have been ex
posed to a biological agent and
preventing its spread. The sec

ond plan outlines how a variety
of departments and personnel
within the hospitals would re
spond to an incident in which
multiple patients were victims of
bioterrorisin."
Pi/zo emphasized the impor
tance of elements which would
ensure that the plan is versatile
and flexible.
"As information related to rec
ognizing, diagnosing, treating and
preventing bioterrorisin is updat
ed at the federal and state level,
this plan will be revised according
ly," he wrote in his newsletter.

ter physicians and staff members,
l'izzo, along with Mike Peterson,
interim president and CEO of
Stanford Hospitals and Clinics,
,ui(l Christopher Dawes, presi
dent and CEO of the Children's
I lospital, explained why I hey feel
the task force is necessary.
"Bioterrorisin by its very na
ture is both complex and difficult
to predict," they said. "Therefore,
the most sensible policies and pro
cedures require constant modifi
cation. The task force will issue
updates, clarifications and infor
mation as situations develop."
