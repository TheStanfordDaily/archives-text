other tragedies elsewhere,"
he added.
Von Sponeck has been cam

not lead to politic ,il i hange in dicta
torial governments."
Yon Sponec k suggested allow
ing Iraq to manage its own finances
and oil as a possible solution.
"In order to kick start their
economy, it is not enough to allow

to manage their own financial af
fairs, particularly their oil re
sources," he added.
( iting statistic s for unemploy

basic needs."

von Sponeck said.

Former UN secretary general and Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, Hans
von Sponeck criticized U.S.'s economic sanctions on Iraq last Friday in a
speech called "Is Iraq on the War Agenda?"
"1 am happy to see so many
people are interested in Iraq," said
junior Mohammed Abdoolcarim,
vice president ol MSAN.
"Hopefully, when people leave
this talk they will have changed
their opinion of what's going on
in this area of politics," Abdool
carim said.

Many in the audience ex
pressed support for von Sponeck's
ideas, applauding his points.
"I came because Sept. 1 1
heightened my interest in under
standing U.S. involvement in the
Middle East," said senior Liz Aab.
"I was looking for someone to
fill the lac k of information about
the sanctions because it is hard to
get very good, well-thought-out
opinions about what's happen
ing," she said. "1 think I am pretty
convinced by his speech."
