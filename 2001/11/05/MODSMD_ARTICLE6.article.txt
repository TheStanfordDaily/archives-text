any decent person sad and angry."

other tragedies elsewhere,"
he added.
Von Sponeck has been cam
paigning against the comprehen
sive economic policy the L'N has
been applying in Iraq, which he
deemed "malicious and hideous."
"There is mounting nonpolitical
evidence of the failure of the eco

nomic sanctions, lie said." 1 hey do
not lead to politic ,il i hange in dicta
torial governments."
Yon Sponec k suggested allow
ing Iraq to manage its own finances
and oil as a possible solution.
"In order to kick start their
economy, it is not enough to allow

to manage their own financial af
fairs, particularly their oil re
sources," he added.
( iting statistic s for unemploy

human condition of Iraqi citi

basic needs."

control h;is destroyed the social
fabric of Iraq and incapacitated
this former center of learning,"
von Sponeck said.
Organizers of the event said
