merous other events on Stanford's campus.
BAS( )C contacted several Olympians to com
pete as relay teams in order to gain publicity and
generate excitement for the (Mympic bid and for
the Treasure Island event itself.
"Over 350 Olympians currently reside in
Northern California," said BAS( )C volunteer co
ordinator James Raybould, also a Stanford
alumnus. " Through the publicity resulting from
this weekend, we hope that more Bay Area resi
dents learn about our bid and more Bay Area
Olympians realize that there are numerous op
portunities for them to become involved."
Two other ()lympic relay teams competed in
Saturday's triathlon. Kim Carlisle, Class of'B3,
Nicole Freedman, Class of '94 and Lindsay

"It was great fun, a beautiful day . . . and a

Triathlon.
