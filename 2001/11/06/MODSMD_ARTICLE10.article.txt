l he School of Medicine's Department
of Psychiatn and the I nivcrsii\ of the Pa
i ific s (iraduate S( liool of Psychology have
formed a joint consortium that will allow
for the stud) of met hods of psvc hotherap\
lhat can he used in clinical practice.
1 he program focuses on training; stu-

Denis for careers in clinical work rather
than ac ademic sand research.
" I lie goal is i ealh simple, and that i•> I <>
attract ,i reallx diverse superb group of
grad students and provide them with (lie
best practitionci training in clinical psy
chology in the I nited Slates, said Psvc lii
atr\ I'rol. Bruce Bongar. who c hairs ilie
new program.
Ps\c hialr\ I'rol. Bruce Arnold, co-di
rector ol ihe program, explained thai
there were iwo motivations behind the
formation ol the consortium.
First, he said, was the under-use of ein
piric all) supported psvc hotherapies in
c linic al \vc>rk.
"We believe that psvc hologists should
be providing' psychotherapy that is eni

piricalh supported," Arnold s.iid. "Ilow
ever, the data we have indicates that em
pirically supported ps\c hotherapies are
underutilized.
"()neol the reasons for this is that there
are not enough opportunities for psu hol
ogists to he trained in empiric.ill\ support
ed methods of treatment even .it the grad
uate level," he said.
Arnold explained that Stanford's I'sv
i hology Department isespec iall\ cjiialified
to provide training in empiric.ill\ sup
ported |>s\( hotherap\ methods.
"Oui stall and faculty have been in
volved in .1 great man\ clinical trials that
have developed new ps\c'hotherapies foi
specific disorders and have established
then eflicacA in c linical trials." he said.

Arnold mentioned the department's
involvement in "trials fora wide variet\
of disorders including mood, anxietv
and eating disorders .is well .is the ap
plication of psychosocial treatment for
patients with chronic or terminal med
ical illness."
I he second motivation for the consor
tium was the belief that "psychiatric and
behavioral disorders are best understood
as brought about and maintained In a
combination of biological, psychological
and sex ial lac tors, \i nold said.
I he consortium's faculty is therefore
comprised of "ps\c hiatrists and psvc holo
gists, which is unicjiie for clinical psw holo
gy programs," Arnold explained.
"We think that our combined expertise

iii areas such as neurobiology. ps\-
< hophannacolog\. cognitive psyc hologx
,ind soc lal learning theory w ill enable us to
well-represent a biopsyc hosocial perspec
tive." he added.
Fatuity from the two uniyersities will
teach the live-year doctoral program.
I lie program involves three vears <>l
graduate coursework, a \car of doc toral
research and a yearlong internship in
(linical psychology.
(Iracluates will earn their degrees
though the Pacific (Graduate School ol
Psychology. I lie consortium, which has
been in the planning stages lor more
than a year, will accept a group ol 25 to
