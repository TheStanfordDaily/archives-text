Three seeiningls unrelated events
happened last week:

Second, another svealths gus has made
an<)ther outtageousls large, record-setting,
hundreds-01-inillions-01-dollars donation
to an alreads wealths and expensive uni
sersity. I his time it was Sf>o() million and
the unisci sit\ was Cal lech. Last time it svas
more than S 100 million and the uniseisits
svas Stanford.

I his is a column not so much about these
three events, but rather about the absurd
world in which the\ would happen, and
then be considered separately.
But. I must note that I.N week was also a
truly phenomenal week in the world ol
sports. Kspccialh in times like these, how

Now I know main people have alread)
written main line sports columns, and
these columnists are olten both obsenant
and Ivrical. But it wouldn't right lor me to
stay quiet.
Why? Because I learned something im
portant oyer the weekend:
Alter an iiu idem in the kin hen. 1 rcal
i/ed that I bleed. I bleed Red. A Red that
looks suspi( ioush like ( animal Red.
And, man oh man, was I bleeding alter
the (lard's exceedingh painful loss to
Washington this week.
I ruly, we were all suffering as we saw
our Stanford team-mates writhing in
agony and blood on the field last Saturday
after the I luskies scort lied us. 12-2N.
It was a miserable sight.
It was the site ola (ireat Power lading, .i
bloody moment we will prohahh neyei for

Stanford (Ordinal — a team that could have
Won It All — falling from the ninth-and
two-thirds best team in the country to the
lsth-and-one-third best team.
(>iii' l< >ss to Washington, to put it simply, was
nothing less tlian totally devastating.
At tunes like these it's important to have
a little perspective. We can take walks and
call relatives and remember that we will all
die eventually. But, perhaps most impor
tantly, we can remember the bottom line:
Stanlord football still has a bright future.
