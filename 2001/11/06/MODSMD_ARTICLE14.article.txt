Condit story 'mind-boggling'
Remember when television was awful
in the summertime, because all <>l the
primetime shows went on hiatus and the
networks just ton ed endless reruns down
our throats?
But, before we could actuall) develop
self-discipline and wrest ourselves away
from I'V's Svengali-likc control over us,
some clever scamp "created" (er â€” "mis
appropriated" from the people who de
veloped "Real World") the genre of "Real
ity Television.' Then, reality I V shows
multiplied like gremlins, and we realized
that they were worse than the renins. Fi
nally, Mr. ('.ondit bailed us out and gave us
the hottest television serial of the summer.
Don't get me wrong. I hope against
hope that (lhandi a I .evv is safe and sound
and just partying it upon the next season
of "Temptation Island." But, any way
you slice it, you have to admit that this
story has the kind of intrigue that even
the most drugged-out fiction writers
couldn't muster.
A congressman? His intern? And.it
turns out he has been shagging his interns
for years? Wait a minute, he makes them

go out in public with them wearing dis
guises and without identification? 1 his is
creepy. And. one of them got pregnant
and had his child? And. his lawyer asked
another one to sign an affidavit deriving
that they've had an aflair? You're kidding,
right? But, at least he's not married.
What? I le is married?
1 (an onl\ imagine what Kill (-linton has
to say about all this: "It's a sad day when
the student actually surpasses the teacher."
At least ( Imton can refer Condit to the for
mer President's moral and spiritual leader:
the Reverend Jesse Jackson. You might re
member Mr. Jackson, lie's the part-time
politician, full-time "man of the cloth"
whose illegitimate child recently surfaced.
"Do as I say, I can hear Jesse admonishing
Messrs. Clinton and Condit.
Condit claims to know nothing alxmt
the disappearance of Ms. Levy. Docs he
think we're all on crack? I only hope for his
sake he can secure the same jury that O.J.
had in his criminal trial. I lie combination
of his shiftiness coupled with Ins indigna
tion that people would actually want to
know the nature of his relationship with
Ms. Levy is mind-boggling.
"I've made my fair share of mistakes,"

Condit told Connie Cluing, I'llsav. Does lie
think we might believe that Chandra fell
victim to the summer's spate of Atlantic
shark attacks? I'm all for respecting the pri
vacy of public officials, bin come on. This is
not, "What did you have for breakfast, did
your daughter drink ai the fiat party?"-
type stuff. A woman is missing, and Condit
needs to come clean.
But, 1 guess this might be a boon for the
political future of the country. |ust think
about the millions of bright young people
who were previously dissuaded from pub
lic serviie by its stuffy reputation. Clinton,
Condit, and Jackson make our nation,s
capital sound like a trip to 1 lugh I Miner's
mansion. Rock-n-roll's loss just might be
our government's gain.
And, here's the beautiful part. Condit's
thinking about running for reelection. Not
a bad strategy actually, when you think
about it. After all. name recognition is the
single-greatest determinant of a candi
date's success. Cary Condit must surely be
known to every voter in his district. I guess
we can only hope that there is such a thing
as bad publicity.
