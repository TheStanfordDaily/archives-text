"This is a chance for students at
Stanford to learn how to do one style
of Zulu dancing," Meintjes said.
The dancers perform Ngoma
dancing, which was developed In
Zulus in South Africa in response to
British militarism. Young men
begin dancing at the same time they
learn to speak and start performing
for the community in their mid
teens. Each community has a com
petitive team of dancers.
"Dancing is everything," said
Phillemon Hamole, who plays the
drum in the group. "The dancers
forget even thing around them lx'-
cause dancing is happiness. I hey
enjoy it more than eating food."

I he style has origins in stick
fighting and is similar to karate. I he
dancers incorporate moves from
bump-jive, a popular form of dance,
and kung-fu. Fat li dancer is called .i

"It is a big mat ho thing." Meint

done in small spurts, giving each
dancer time to b<>ast."
At the end of each sequence
made up of somersaults and stick
fights, the dancers lall flat onto the
ground on the final beat.
Fowler explained that the
Um/ansis' visit provides a unique
opportunity for the campus and
surrounding community to experi

culture that is inaccessible to aim>ne
