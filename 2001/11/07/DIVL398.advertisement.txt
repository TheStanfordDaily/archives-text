Stephen Elliott,
Stegner Fellow and
author of the new book,
A Life Without
Consequences
A Life Without Consequences is the
semi-biographical novel from emerging
author, Stephen Elliott, which traces the
fate of Paul, a boy whose mother has died
and who runs away from a violent father.
The book follows Paul from living on the
streets of Chicago to passing through
juvenile institutions and a state system
programmed for failure. As he grows and
battles the violent system, he starts to
come to terms with his own path, and we
see that Paul's emotions that we think are
anger are actually the determination to
take control of his future. This book was
selected for the 2001 Wallace Stegner
Fellowship at Stanford University.
Stephen Elliot's work has appeared in
literary journals and magazines and in 1994,
he was awarded the James L. Rainey Award
for fiction with his story, "Two Men".
