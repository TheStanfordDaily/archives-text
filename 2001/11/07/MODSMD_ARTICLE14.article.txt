## The
						Stanford Daily Be a better student, citizen: listen to foreign views 
### 
Published Since IX'H

I! seems everyone on campus lias an
opinion on America's current war on
terrorism, and usually a strong one at
that. But even at Stanford, where we
pride ourselves on our intellectual abilities
and our commitment to learning, it is all too
common for students to be uninformed
about foreign affairs contexts and perspec
tives that surround issues of America's cur
rent foreign policy.
I his phenomenon is not unique to Stan
ford. For the majority of our existences, the
vast portion of Americans lead insulated
lives, blissfully unaware of overseas conflict,
diplomacy or perspectives. I here is little
media coverage of siu h issues and even less
reader interest. For most of the time, Ameri
cans seem to think the woi Id revolves around
us and since there is nothing to actively con
tradict this, we continue to embrace sin h an

ethnocentric notion.
I his was all well and good until the events
of Sept. I I knocked askew our sense of order
in the world. I hey brought our lives into
sudden catastrophic conflict with the rest of
the globe and revealed how our oblivious
ness has left us woefully unprepared to com
prehend and analy/e the current state of
world affairs.
In light of the events of the past two
months, it especially imperative that we .it
Stanford take advantage of all the opportu
nities our university provides us with to ex
pand our perspective, become more in
formed on issues of global import and expose
ourselves to points of view that are not
Ameri-centric. II we do take advantage of
these opportunities, we can make the most
informed judgements possible on these cru
cial issues.

With so much at stake in this "War on Ter
rorism" that we are waging, we at Stanford
have a duty to make the most of our vast re
sources to gain the a well-rounded, unbiased
understanding of the past, present and fu
ture of American foreign involvement.
Specifically, in the past few weeks our cam
pus has had the privilege of receiving visits
from former Pakistani prime minister Be
nazir Bhutto, former United Nations Secre
tary Hans von Sponeck and Prime Minister
o! the Czech Republic Milos Zeman, all of
whom have given talks of relevant issues lac
ing tin tent U.S. foreign relations.
While varying widely in stance and focus,
each of these figures contributed a unique
perspective 011 global events and interactions
to which we as Americans are not commonly
exposed. (>oing to these events and others of
this sort can give us the new understanding

and context of foreign a flairs that is missing
in our media and from our leaders.
Because these visits and lectures from
world figures are so enlightening, it is im
portant that they continue, especially dur
ing this time of war. We urge every organi
zation and department at Stanford to search
for and invite speakers who have foreign
perspectives to share with us. Authors, lead
ers, activists and executives will all have dif
ferent, yet important, ideas to express.
No matter what your position on our
country's current actions and involvement in
Afghanistan and around the world, you can
stand to learn from new perspectives. It is
our duty .is students, as intellectuals and as
citizens to gather as much information and
background and listen to as many voices as
possible before forming any sort of opinion
on American foreign policy.
