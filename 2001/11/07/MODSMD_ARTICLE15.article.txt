## Dancing on graves 
### 
Stanford's Mausoleum came
alive on the evening of Friday,
()ct. 2f>. to c elebrate I lalloween.
Last vear, I missed the annual
tradition by showing up on Oct. .SI.
1 hat was a luesday. I his year, I got it
right. My friends and I arrived around
midnight to find a couple hundred stu
dents dancing in front o! the tomb. We
paused on the periphery. Without
thinking, 1 took oil m\ coat. I stood
there in an Oxford University Ama
teur Boxing (Hub sweatshirt (I was un
able to find a (ieorgia lech sweatshirt
in mv wardrobe). My girlfriend

touched her hair. It was
aGraybealian moment.
The party was well
on liest rated. 1 here
were large video
screens, loud music
(with angry lyrics) and
lights. People were
decked out in cos-

tumes. There was a French maid, a
Stanford Mutant Ninja Turtle and a
costuine-on-a-budget guy with .»towel
around his waist and a mop on his
head. I kept looking for wine, beer and
spirits. All I saw were police officers
around the perimeter. The place was
sealed oil with barricades and security
guards in uniform. It looked like a
toxic waste dump. The dancers were
under control, and they caused no
damage with their ninja shells and
mops.
I thought of Omar Khayyam. He
was a Persian poet / mathematician /
book-nerd from the 12th century who
wrote about the evanescence of life and
the importance of the "living it up
while you can" philosophy later cham
pioned by Jack Kerouac. There's no
better illustration of Khayyam's poetry
than the Mausoleum party on the
night of (or, technically speaking, sev
eral nights before) Halloween.
Khayyam wrote:
Ah, make the most of what we yet
may spend.
Before we too into the dust descend.
Dust into dust, and under dust, to
lie,
Sans wine, sans song, sans singer
and — sans end!
Khayyam would've been disappointed
that there was no wine. However,
many students had taken their fair
share before visiting the tomb.
Dancing near the tomb was
thrilling. It violated the prissy stan
dards of western culture that put death

at an arm's length and send bodies
straight to the morgue foi expert han
dling. That's not the way n happened
in old Russia. Iblstoy wrote in"The
Death ol Ivan Ilvich" about a bodv that
was left ma sitting room lor days while
visitors paid their respects. A pungent
smell filled t lie* room, but nobody
cared. 1 'hat wouldn't happen in our
sanitary culture. We want death, decav
and odors to be out of sight and out of
mind. I he tomb parts breaches this di
vide and tickles our sense of propriety.
I he Mausoleum is the most mvste
l ious part of campus and, Halloween
or not, it's always a bit scary to me. It's
a dark walk. Kventually, the path
opens onto a circle of pavement with
clear space in front ol the grave. I he
darkness of the path is broken by
moonlight in the circle. Noisy trallic
recedes into the distance and vegeta
tion screens any view of the outside
world. The Stanford family's spirit
seems to radiate from this mausoleum
through a pale light emanating from
the doors. In actuality, this light comes
from cars turning onto Palm Drive.
Knowing that, of course, has never
stopped me from getting scared.

were probably lured to California with

they were looking fora quiet job. If so.
they made the right choice. There
aren't many visitors to the Mau
soleum. lourists, for example, are
more interested in the Main Quad the
Oval, and a tall building named after
an unsuccessful president. And, of
course, they like to visit a building that
became Jane Stanford's darling after
her husband's death: Memorial
Church.
With all due respect to Mrs. Stan
ford, the Mausoleum is the real heart
of Stanford. First of all, it's the resting
place of the University's founders.
Their ambition, spirit and drive creat
ed this place. Their grave is the true
focal point fora university created
from their own money and dreams.
They believed in the University so
much that they put their money w here
their mouths were. In fact, they put
their bodies there, too. The least we
can do is go there to show our respect.
Second, the Mausoleum represents
everything the Stanfords stood for: ed
ucation, history, culture and a lot of
wealth. They were religious people,

which is why Memorial Church was so
important to Mrs. Stanford. Yet they
were buried in a box topped with tri
angles. I bis brilliant design conies
from antiquity and not, as Rush Litn
baugh might believe, from the U.S.
Capitol Building. I he Ktruscans first
constructed boxes topped with trian
gles. and they were copied by Greeks
and Romans. We now have boxes and
small triangles all over the country but.
on this campus, the Mausoleum is our
onl\ link to classical architecture.
I bird, the Mausoleum is our little
secret. It gets attention twice every
\ ear: I lalloween (or several nights be
fore, I should say) and Founder's Day.
I he average person would get lost try
ing to find the Mausoleum. I know this
from experience. In my first year, I got
lost exploring the campus and acci
dentally spotted the glimmering doors
of the Mausoleum. My curiosity led
me down its path. I he tomb was mi

marked. I wondered about it for
weeks. Finally, 1 learned that it was the
tomb of a remarkable family that
brought learning to the western fron
tier. I hat's good enough reason to
tlirow an annual party.
