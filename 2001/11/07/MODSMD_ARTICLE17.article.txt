America is facing many threats today
11 lis letter is .1 response to a statement
made in Jason Rheins's article about the
biggest threat to America todav. The
biggest threats to Aineric .1 todav are main
of the same threats that existed before
Sept. 11. Km in a wartime atmosphere
w here lear dominates the minds of Amer
icans, I fear that these threats are no
longer on our agenda. I he biggest threat
to America is that we will allow those who
wish to iidatk our freedom of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness to succeed.
1 he histoid of America is full of contra
dictions, but there are two overwhelming
consistent ies that began in the (Constitution
and Bill of Rights. First, the Constitution
has tenets that guarantee the promise ola
better America. These principles include
those that allow for future amendments,
and those that assume governments can be
come tyrannical over time, and that it is our
duty as Americans to do whatever possible
to make sure that tyranny does not become
a part of our civilization.
Second, some Anglo, male landowners
figured out that in order to protect their in
dividual rights to wealth, life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, that all Anglo, male
land owners need to have equal protection
under the law. I bis has given birth to equal
protection under the law as we know it.
Despite these consistencies, the atten
tion given to the image of Osama Bin
Laden and to the tragedy has allowed for
five diflerent threats to the promise of a
better America to go unchecked.
I'll real number one is ih;it freedom of
privacy, one of our constitutional rights,
has been eroded. I encourage everyone to
research the Patriot Act, and other legisla

tion th.it has allowed our country to he
tome .1 place where there are cameras in
the public domain, even in inv home state
of Hawaii. I'o a (rue American, the rights
of the innocent outweighs the desire to
punish therriminal. Law enforcement can
now use a wide variety of invisible light fre
quencies to look into your home, from the
ground and from the skv. I he Patriot Act
allows law enforcement to observe your
home without having to produce evidence
to serve as probable cause.
Those of you who believe that this legis
lation .ind technology will only Ik 1 used
against potential terrorists, or certain demo
graphic groups, will find yourselves sadlv
mistaken one day. More databases, retinal
scans. DNA imprints and identification
cards may not in and of themselves consti
tute a violation of freedom of privacy, but
lliey do represent an erosion of that right.
Threat number two is that the promise
of equal protection of the law has been de
laved even further. It has been delayed by
tlie* fact that Americans from all kinds of
national origins and racial backgrounds
are not stepping up to protect the rights of
Americans and legal residents of Middle
T.astern or South Asian descent. Remem
ber that the laws and even some law en
forcement practices that came in the wake
of Sept. 1 I will not be used only against the
two aforementioned demographics of
Americans and legal residents.
All of our rights need to be protected so
that the rights of our families can be pro
tected. I hose who remember World War
11 and wish to honor the Japanese-Ameri
cans who lost their liberty, should be con
scious of protecting the rights of Ameri
cans and legal residents of Middle Kaslern
and South Asian descent. Those Ameri

cans who wish i<> honor those six million
Ashkenasis who died in World War II
should do so by preventing America from
giving in to the temptations of fascism and
unequal protection under the law.
I lireat number three is that campaign
finance has undermined democracy fora
longtime, flic election of 1080 ushered in
.111 age where a Presidential campaign
could not be discerned from an advertis
ing campaign with a polished spokesper
son. Ihe elections of 1992 and 1996
marked the l.ist time that free market
forces dictated the outcome of an election.
1 do not believe that even free market
forces dictated the outcome of the last
rate, let alone democratic fortes. In this
past election the nomination of the Re
publican candidate ditl not go to the per
son tli.it registered Republicans preferred
by popular vote, John McCain.
I'll is lack of campaign finance reform
has lead directly to war profiteering.
Those companies w ho have energy inter
ests, and especially those with close ties to
1 exas or w ho had given a massive amount
of money to the Republican party, have
disproportionately benefited from
wartime stimulus packages seemingly bro
kered by Vice President Dick Cheney.
How can a small. Dallas-based energy
company with only 1 (>,()()() employees re
ceive $(}()() million in federal aid? I hat
disgusts me, using the death of 6,000
Americans to peddle influence from the
White House.
I hreat number four is the corruption
of elections. Ihe specter of terrorism has
allowed us to so easily forget that vote tam
pering probably took place in both the
(ion* and Bush camps. Americans will not
forget ihis when il tomes lime to vote for
senators, representatives and the next
President. Perhaps Vmericans will re
think why our two major parties are still
subsidized with matt liing funds, and the
reason behind allowing soft mone\ to be
unlimited.

and those that assume governments can be
come tyrannical over time, and that it is our
duty as Americans to do whatever possible
to make sure that tyranny does not become
a part of our civilization.
Second, some Anglo, male landowners
figured out that in order to protect their in
dividual rights to wealth, life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, that all Anglo, male
land owners need to have equal protection
under the law. I bis has given birth to equal
protection under the law as we know it.
Despite these consistencies, the atten
tion given to the image of Osama Bin
Laden and to the tragedy has allowed for
five diflerent threats to the promise of a
better America to go unchecked.
I'll real number one is ih;it freedom of
privacy, one of our constitutional rights,
has been eroded. I encourage everyone to
research the Patriot Act, and other legisla

tion th.it has allowed our country to he
tome .1 place where there are cameras in
the public domain, even in inv home state
of Hawaii. I'o a (rue American, the rights
of the innocent outweighs the desire to
punish therriminal. Law enforcement can
now use a wide variety of invisible light fre
quencies to look into your home, from the
ground and from the skv. I he Patriot Act
allows law enforcement to observe your
home without having to produce evidence
to serve as probable cause.
Those of you who believe that this legis
lation .ind technology will only Ik 1 used
against potential terrorists, or certain demo
graphic groups, will find yourselves sadlv
mistaken one day. More databases, retinal
scans. DNA imprints and identification
cards may not in and of themselves consti
tute a violation of freedom of privacy, but
lliey do represent an erosion of that right.
Threat number two is that the promise
of equal protection of the law has been de
laved even further. It has been delayed by
tlie* fact that Americans from all kinds of
national origins and racial backgrounds
are not stepping up to protect the rights of
Americans and legal residents of Middle
T.astern or South Asian descent. Remem
ber that the laws and even some law en
forcement practices that came in the wake
of Sept. 1 I will not be used only against the
two aforementioned demographics of
Americans and legal residents.
All of our rights need to be protected so
that the rights of our families can be pro
tected. I hose who remember World War
11 and wish to honor the Japanese-Ameri
cans who lost their liberty, should be con
scious of protecting the rights of Ameri
cans and legal residents of Middle Kaslern
and South Asian descent. Those Ameri

cans who wish i<> honor those six million
Ashkenasis who died in World War II
should do so by preventing America from
giving in to the temptations of fascism and
unequal protection under the law.
I lireat number three is that campaign
finance has undermined democracy fora
longtime, flic election of 1080 ushered in
.111 age where a Presidential campaign
could not be discerned from an advertis
ing campaign with a polished spokesper
son. Ihe elections of 1992 and 1996
marked the l.ist time that free market
forces dictated the outcome of an election.
1 do not believe that even free market
forces dictated the outcome of the last
rate, let alone democratic fortes. In this
past election the nomination of the Re
publican candidate ditl not go to the per
son tli.it registered Republicans preferred
by popular vote, John McCain.
I'll is lack of campaign finance reform
has lead directly to war profiteering.
Those companies w ho have energy inter
ests, and especially those with close ties to
1 exas or w ho had given a massive amount
of money to the Republican party, have
disproportionately benefited from
wartime stimulus packages seemingly bro
kered by Vice President Dick Cheney.
How can a small. Dallas-based energy
company with only 1 (>,()()() employees re
ceive $(}()() million in federal aid? I hat
disgusts me, using the death of 6,000
Americans to peddle influence from the
White House.
I hreat number four is the corruption
of elections. Ihe specter of terrorism has
allowed us to so easily forget that vote tam
pering probably took place in both the
(ion* and Bush camps. Americans will not
forget ihis when il tomes lime to vote for
senators, representatives and the next
President. Perhaps Vmericans will re

reason behind allowing soft mone\ to be

America is facing many threats today
11 lis letter is .1 response to a statement
made in Jason Rheins's article about the
biggest threat to America todav. The
biggest threats to Aineric .1 todav are main
of the same threats that existed before
Sept. 11. Km in a wartime atmosphere
w here lear dominates the minds of Amer
icans, I fear that these threats are no
longer on our agenda. I he biggest threat
to America is that we will allow those who
wish to iidatk our freedom of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness to succeed.
1 he histoid of America is full of contra
dictions, but there are two overwhelming
consistent ies that began in the (Constitution
and Bill of Rights. First, the Constitution
has tenets that guarantee the promise ola
better America. These principles include
those that allow for future amendments,
and those that assume governments can be
come tyrannical over time, and that it is our
duty as Americans to do whatever possible
to make sure that tyranny does not become
a part of our civilization.
