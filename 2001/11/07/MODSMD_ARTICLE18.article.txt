Just when you thought the
solar system has been thorough
ly explored . . . Astronomers
from the Kuropean Southern ()b
-sersatois have measured an as

largest one in our system. I he ic\

We are living in the midst of a
massive extinction. I his is the
s ievs ol some ecologists who gath
ered at the annual meeting ol the
Sociels for ( onservation Biology
in August. \c( ending to scien
tists, ovei I 100 species may have
disappeared in the past 500
sc.its. Most ol these scientists
agree that human actisits has
been a major lorce. Indeed, the
scenario is comparable to the
otliei fis e major mass extinctions

in the faith's
history, the
last ol which
was Of) mil
lion years ago
with i he
demise ol di
nosa u is .
Moi cover,
these rates
are expected
to rise over
12-fold in i lie

next HOO years. Many paleontolo
gists and statisticians have doubt
ed such comparisons, claiming
that the numbers reflect only nat
ural rates of extinction. Although
it is hard to measure accurately
t he nalurc of the extinction, most
sc ieutists agree that c onservation
is essential.
Theory holds that fewer stu
dents in a classroom translate into
less noise and less disruptive be
havior, creating a better learning
environment. A recent studs pub

The origin of whales has been
the subject of much debate. Alter
all, how can the huge, sea
dwelling whale have evolved ll
most mammals are small and live
on land? Fossils suggested their
ancestors were extinct hyena-like
creatures known as mesonychi
ans. More recently, I)NA evi
dence lias indicated descent Irom
artiodactyls — the same group as
hippos, pigs and ruminants. Now
fossils from Pakistan could settle
the matter. Using the newly
found hones, paleontologists are
connecting the evolutionary dots
between artiodactyls and whales.
So far, the skeleton appears to
support the controversial claim
that hippos are the closest living
relatives of whales.

Do you have a cold? Soon you will be
able to take an anti-viral and be well
in no time. While the 20th century
was the centurv of antibiotics, the 21st
promises to be the < entuty ofanti-vi
rals. Combining cutting-edge re
scan li in genomics and protcomics,
scientists have been developing
drugs that target the pathogenic
DNAor proteins. I lie goal is to neu
tral i/e them and thus aid the im
mune svstcm in destroying the in
vaders. Current drugs include
genome disrupters that target HIV,
protein s\ nthcsis disrupters that help
light hepatitis Band C, and inhibitors
of virus release lor inlluenza KUnfor
