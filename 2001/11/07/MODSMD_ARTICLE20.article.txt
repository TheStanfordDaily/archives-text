# Drug patent rights controversy looms
## Patent, public health controversy heats up over Cipro 
### ABIGAIL PHILLIPS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lit- reeent clamor over Cipro may abate
now iliai the Centers for Disease Control
ha\e officials endorsed doxycycline as the
th ug t>f choice for anthrax treatment. How
ever, ihe interim pandemonium has raised
some interesting questions about patent poli
(\ that are not likely to disappear for awhile.
Bayer, ihe company that invented aspirin,
owns the patent on Cipro. I his means that
Bayer has the exclusive tight to manufacture
and sell Cipro, its "invention," fora limited
time. (Baver's patent on Cipro will expire in
Dec. 2003.) Ihe United
Slates government in retent years has been a
proponent of strong intellectual property
lights. Patent rights are far broader now than
the\ were when the lirsi patent law was passed
— compare the 175,98)1 patents that were is
sued last vear with the three that were granted
in the yeai 1790. And, in the international
arena, the I nited States has consistently pres
sured other countries to honor U.S. patents.
Consider, then, the remarkable turnaround
when the current administration began dis
cussing the possibility of overriding Bayer's
patent on Cipro. Legally speaking, abrogating
Bayer's patent is very easy. Under the principle
of eminent domain, an official of the United
States may declare a patent invalid for almost
any reason. Eminent domain permits the gov
ernment toco-opt needed property in exchange
lor compensation that mayor may not equal the
market value of the property.
Ultimately, the administration resolved to
leave Bayer's patent intact. In practice, though,
the patent was significantly undermined.
Tommy Thompson, Secretary of Health and
Human Services, threatened to bypass Bayer's

patent if the pharmaceutical company tlitl not
agree to supply the drug to the government at
very low cost.
I he standard rationale for having a patent
system — which allows limited forms of mo
nopoly despite traditional distrust of monopo
listic behavior — is company incentive. Compa
nies need the guarantee of a recuperation of
profits, it is argued, before they will invest in
costly research that might result in a useful in
vention.
But the patent system is not without its critics.
Objections include the risk of having only one
producer of a critical product, the power of a
patent holder to charge well above what is neces
sary fora modest profit and the deterrent against
manufacturing products that are serviceable but
don't turn a profit. This last may be one of the
reasons so few antibiotics like Cipro are being de
veloped; they rarely bring the kind of money
pharmaceutical companies can make from other
kinds of drugs.
Perhaps one of the most significant objections
to the patent regime comes from developing na
tions with AIDS epidemics and other diseases
that cannot afford costly medicines needed for
treatment. The issue arose last year with the an
tiretroviral AIDS drug d4t that was developed at
Yale University and licensed to Bristol-Myers
Squibb. Prohibitively high prices prevented
countries like South Africa with a high propor
tion of AIDS patients from purchasing the med
icine in ample quantities. After much negotiat
ing, Squibb eventually agreed to allow a generic
version of the drug to be produced for use in
South Africa. Ciprofloxacin, eflective in treating
malaria and tuberculosis as well as the sec
ondary infections that AIDS patients often con
tract, is itself an important drug that many de
veloping nations need but cannot afford.
The controversy in the United States over

Cipro has brought the patent protection ques
tion lo the forefront of international discus
sion, and it promises to he the focus of Novem
ber's WTO trade talks in Qatar. Brazil and
India are leading many nations in a push fora
broad public health exception to international
patent rules, an exception that would allow, for
example, abrogation of a patent in the face of
an AIDS or malaria epidemic. While a similar
exception exists under international patent
law, it is narrow and traditionally has not been
applied to AIDS medicines. This has in part
been due to pressure from the U.S. govern
ment. Ihe U.S., along with Switzerland and
several other countries, has so far resisted the
movement to put public health concerns cate
gorically above patent policy. It is a stance,
however, that may well change if bioterrorism
continues to be a threat.
