# New York loss has Mac singing Yankee Doodle Dandy
## 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF COLUMNIST 
For 19 years, two months, and 16 days,
I contemplated the existence of a su
pernatural being, and this past Sun
day, I finally had an epiphany.
As Luis Gonzalez's bloop single
dropped into the shallow outfield, allow
ing Jay Bell to score the winning run of the
2001 World Series, I realized that there is,
in fact, a god — and he may not be sitting
up in heaven wearing Yankee pinstripes
with 26 championship rings on his fingers.
To make things clear, I'd like to point
out that I'm not from Arizona and I'm not
a Diamondbacks fan in the least. I'm a na
tive New Yorker and a Mets fan with a
deep hatred for the Yankees.
Over the past month, I sat there in front
of the television, my body writhing as Joe

Buck talked about how
the Yankees represented
so much more in the wake
of September 11th and
how good it would be for
the city of New York, and
the country as a whole, for
the Yankees to win.
It would be the feel- -
good story of the year,

everyone said. A triumph over terror and
evil. I listened to all of this and I filmed.
For me, the Yankees could never rep
resent the true essence of New York in a
million years, with the sixth member of
'NSYNC (Jeter) as their star and a psy
chotic, bat-wielding menace (Clemens) as
their leader.
Now you can say to yourself that this ha
tred is contrived and that it is just a mask of
bitterness and jealousy since I'm a Mets

fan, .in often sad existence in and of itself.
I his may he true. I'll give a Nixonesque
"non-denial denial," and say il it is true, so
be it.
I lie hatred is well deserved in every
sense of the word, and 1 think I will carry it
to my grave. Over the past five years, 112 have
been witness to more Yankee comebacks,
more one-in-a-lifetime miracles, than I
could ever imagine.
I have seen the Yankees win playoff se
ries countless times, in which they were in
no way the better team.
1 have seen the hand of god — I mean,
Jeffrey Maier — reach out and save them
in 1990, Chuck Knoblauch's phantom tag
in 1999, I imo Perez inexplicably not run
ning hard around the bases last year and
Jeremy Giambi not sliding in this year's
ALDS (which goes down in my book right
alongside Chris Webber's timeout call as

one of the dumbest plays I have ever seen
in sports).
In each of these instances, and too
many others to even try to recount, the
Yankee aura somehow propelled oppo
nents to act like clueless Little Leaguers or
umpires to ostensibly shove their heads
up their rears.
And so, on Sunda\ evening, 1 assumed
that this seemingly divinely inspired mys
tique would once again prevail, as the Dia
mondbacks would find someway to falter.
Byung-Hyun Kim had already done
his best Mitch Williams-meets-Ray !• in
kle impression not once, but twice, al
lowing the Yankees to force a seventh
game in a series in which they batted
.IH.S, getting out.scored by a ridiculous
margin.
Alfonso Soriano's solo shot to take
the lead in the eighth inning sealed the

deal in my mind. I had been through
too much heartbreak to nurture any
hope. I had seen Mariano Rivera close
the door too many times to even imag
ine that he might squander the lead and
blow his first post-season save in con
secutive chances.
As I saw Grace single to lead off the
ninth, I just shook my head and thought
how cruel it was for D-Back fans that he got
on base. In my eyes it was like taunting a
baby. Even when Rivera threw away
Miller's bunt, I si ill couldn't believe any
thing good was going to happen, and Bell's
botched sacrifice just made me more cer
tain that the Yankees would somehow find
a way to win yet again.
Rivera then got two strikes on Womack,
about to mow him down with a cutter like he
