The answer: this Stan lord under
graduate just made an impressive
showing at the 2001 "Jeopardy!" Col
lege 1 ournament.
I he correct response: Who is sopho
more Vinita Kailasanath?
l he answers — phrased in the lorm
of a question, of course — seemed to
come easy for kailasanath, who compet
ed against 15 students from s( hoots siu h
as 1 larvard, Bradley and Brown in ;i two
day taping from Oct. 6 and 7 at I C.LVs
Pauley Pavilion.
Kailasanath is barred from disclosing
the outcome of the tournament, but she
admitted that she performed well in the
two-week event.
If Kailasanath did indeed win the

competition, she would now he $">O,OOO
richer and the proud owner of a new
2001 Volvo.
I 'he home school of the tournament
champion also receives a scholarship
fund of $25,000.
" I he whole experience seems a bit un
real," she s;ti(l.
Kailasanath, a human biology major, is
not new to the <|iii/ bowl circuit. She was
the captain of bet Maryland high school
academic bow I team, as well as captain of
an all-star state team that placed first in
national competition two times.
Kailasanath said she has always been
interested in being a "Jeopard)!" contes
tant. and a friend entered her in a Balti
more search last summer.
Potential contestants were chosen
through a random chawing. I lie next
"cut" consisted of taking a 50-cjuestion

"lill in the blank" written lest, out of
which Kailasanath answered IX correct
ly. I'hen, potential contestants played a
mock game and completed an interview.
One day in mid-September,
Kailasanath found an envelope from
the producers.
"1 thought it was a rejection letter,"
she said, "but it was the ac tual'('.ongratil
lations! You've been selected lor College
Jeopardy!' letter."
When asked how she prepared for the
contest, Kailasanath gave a typical Stan
ford student answer.
"1 didn't actually have ninth time to
study because of activities and lluin Hio
readings and problem sets." sin- said.
Nevertheless, she said she feels the
questions were too easy.

Sophomore Vinita Kailasanath said she was happy with her performance during the two-week
2001 "jeopardy!" College Tournament. The tournament will be televised on KGO-TV Channel 27
starting tomorrow, with the championship round airing Nov. 21.
"1 wanted difficult questions so
th.it everyone wouldn't be hu/zing
in at the same time," she said.
As for Alex 1 rebek, Kailasanath
said that he"was very nice, - ' al
though "he's tired of being asked
about (shaving] his must.u he and
'Celebrity |eopardv! |skits| on
'Saturday Night 1 .ive.' "
Kailasanath also revealed her
strategy for playing the game.

" I iniing is definitel) key," she ex
plained, as contestants are not al
lowed to ring in until the question
is completeh read. Bu//.ing in too
early imposes a hall-second
penalty before a contestant can
ring in again.
"I definitely got burned on tlie
buzzer," she said.
kailasanatli said she was onl\
neryous right before the taping
began. "The most nene-racking
part is when they do their count
down before the theme song
starts pla\ ing."

is astoundingly grounded and
humble." she said.
