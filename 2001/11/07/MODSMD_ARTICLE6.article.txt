# Device helps to detect anthrax
## 'Health Buddy' being tested as possible tool against biowarfare 
### RAVNEET KAUR 
Roseart - luts and doctors at the
Medical ('.enter are currently test
ing a biowarfare symptom surveil
lance device ili.it has the potential
to be used .is .1 nationwide monitor
lor the possible existence of infec
tious diseases.
T he device, developed by
I lealth I lero Network and known
as the I lealth Buddy, was original
ly developed ;is an in-home system
for monitoring patients with dis
eases such .is asthma, diabetes and
emphysema, according to Kric L.

Weiss, assistant professor of
surgery at the Medical ( "enter.
"It is remotely programmable
via phone line and interacts with
the user through surveys and dia
logues using a screen and lour but
tons." said Steve Brown, (TO of
the Health Hero Network.
"The goal of the very simple
user interface is to provide conve
nience to the user and to minimize
the burden of data collection,"
Brown continued.
"It is meant for remote health
monitoring and communication,
including chronic care, research
and now public health surveil
lance," he said.
"Up until now, most of the ap
plications have been for in-home
use, for chronic care and re
search," he said. " I lie same simple

interface that enables Health
Buddy to work so well in the home
also is the key to enabling low-bur
den real-time data collection from
busy healthcare professionals."
Weiss said he thought the de
vice had wide-ranging applica
tions involving surveillance.
Weiss worked with the compa
ny to rewrite the questions that
the device asks users, so that in
stead of inquiring about diabetes
or other diseases, it asks ques
tions concerning possibly threat
ening infections.
"[ The hospital has] been moni
toring about 83 infections that
should be reported should a case
appear as mandated by the state of
(lalifbrnia," Weiss said.
