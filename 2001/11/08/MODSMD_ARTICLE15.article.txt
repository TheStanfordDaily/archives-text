Intel lift << Mined ion speeds in Stanford dor
initoi ies have slowed significantly over the
past two years because of the University's
policies for network management. The
( in rent polities are counterproductive and
harmful foi three reasons. First, they area waste
ol resources. Second, they unfairly slow only stu
dent network traffic. I hird, they represent a
misunderstanding of the uses and purposes of
today's Internet.
I he problem comes on the connection that
Stanford uses to connect to the "commodity In
ternet. oi commercial Web sites that account
fora high percentage of browsing. ()nlv 40 per
cent of the connection to these sites is allotted for
use in student residences. The rest is reserved
for faculty, staff and library use. This limited
bandwidth must be shared among all on-cam
pus residents. As a result, these sites take rela
tiveh longer to load when many students are
sharing the connection.
Reserving f>o percent of the University's

connection for non-student use at all times is a
horrible mismanagement of the connection.
Few faculty or library users need Internet ac
cess during the evening hours, precisely when
student use peaks. It is tremendously ineffi
cient for this network capacity to sit unused
while students suffer through slow connec
tions during the evening. 1 his pipeline should
be allotted to faculty and staff use during the
day and residence use at night. T his simple re
allocation will ensure that .ill users receive last
speeds when they connect.
Currently, all connections from residences
are subject to "packet shaping," which priori
tizes traffic to sites while
slowing traffic to music- or file-sharing services.
The current rate of $9 per month for an in
room connection is tar below market rates for
high-speed Internet connections. Nevertheless,
students who are browsing the Internet for per
sonal use and who have paid for the service
should not face slowdowns.

Furthermore, no other connections on cam
pus are restricted in this way. If Stanford feels it
necessary to prioritize Internet traffic, it must do
so equally for everyone. It is paradoxical for the
University not to slow the Internet use of facul
ty and staff — who are using the Internet on
Stanford's time and equipment — but to slow
the use ofstudents who use the Internet on their
own time, on their own computer and in their
own room. I his treatment of students is unfair.
Any change in Internet policy should include
a re-examination of Stanford's current attitude
toward the Internet as well. No longer can it be
seen as a purely academic tool, as the current
policies imply by prioritizing academic and re
search-oriented traffic. 'I'lie Internet is an amaz
ing. comprehensive and often exclusive source
for information, entertainment and commerce.
All these uses are equallv valid. Indeed, network
traffic should not be prioritized based on the
uses that Stanford deems appropriate. 1 he Uni
versity should manage its connection to ensure

equal speed for everyone, not to prioritize cer
tain "desirable" types of activity.
We appreciate that Internet speeds at Stan
ford are vastly faster than most Americans'. Even
with packet shaping, the connection speed from
the dorms is more than adequate. Indeed, the
troubling issue here is the principles embodied
in the University's policies. Stanford slows stu
dents' Internet use and no one else's, and stu
dent network traffic is prioritized according to
arbitrary ideas about ideal Internet uses.
We urge the University to rethink its network
allocation policies in light of actual usage and the
changing nature of the Internet. In doing so, we
encourage it to increase the bandwidth available
to student residences during the evening hours
and to remove all devices that prioritize certain
types of Internet traffic without ensuring the
same connection speed for all users. These
changes will show that Stanford is still committed
to technology as a tool to be used equally by ev
eryone on campus.
