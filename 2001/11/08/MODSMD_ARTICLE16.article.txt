# RAREFIED AIR
## Corrupted by the cash 
### 
In all mv years of watching baseball,
I don't think I've ever seen a better
Work I Series than the one that un
folded this year. 1 he Arizona Dia
mondbacks triumphantly stole the title
from the stranglehold of the New York
Yankees in dramatic fashion in the lx)t
tom of the ninth inning of (iame 7.
I hose bovs from Phoenix singlc-hand
edly restored my faith in the game.
Baseball exists tor moments like
that — lot the unbelievable drama con
tained in that final |>it(li from Mariano
Rivera to Luis (ion/ale/.. It made you,
lor an instant, enjoy life's simplicities.
I wo guys, manoa inano, pitcher against
baiter. Kat li tn ing tooutplay and outwit

the other. I he memory
of those seconds was
going to keep me pla
cated dui ing the empty
off-season.
Unfortunately, my
happy thoughts lasted a
mere two davs. Then
the team owners had to

gooll in typical fashion and muck every
thing up. Karlv this week, the baseball
powers-that-In* were sitting around dis
cussing the future of the league when
someone must have decided that tfiev
weren't making enough money. I can
imagine the conversation proceeding
like something out of an all-too-accurate
comedy sketch.
Baseball ()wner( )ne: "All right, guvs.
My accountant just gave me an update
on my financial situation, and 1 have to
say, 1 just don't think 112 can survive on
only $10 million a year." Murmurs of
agreement fill the room.
Owner 'Iwo: "How about this? Let's
foi"get the fact that tfiis is a sport fora
minute, and that it makes life a bit more
livable for millions of people each year.
Let's look at it as just another invest
ment. A business deal."
Owner Three turns to the owner of
the Montreal Kxpos: "Right. It's not
personal. We like you, Montreal, but
let's face it, you suck. You average bare
ly 7,000 fans per game, and your team
consistently represents the dregs of the
National League."
(hvner Four chimes in with the same
message for Minnesota, Florida and
lampa Bay.
Finally, a consensus is reached. The
Commissioner stands up to make the
announcement. " I wo teams have got
to go. Fifty players will lose their jobs,
and when you combine them with the
164 who are eligible to file for free
agency this year, you've got more than
200 top athletes vying for limited space
on major league ballclubs. So what?

They'll manage. What's important is
that we're saving the game here, and
oh, it doesn't hurt that it fattens our
wallets a bit."
It's a problem prevalent not only in
baseball, but in practicallv even sport
these days. We allow out teams to be
managed by a group comp(>scd primar
ily of aging men who seem to care little
alx)iit the game itself and instead fixus
all their attention on television contracts
and sparkling new stadiums. The no
tion is absurd.
Now, I will quickly concede the fact
that the owners are not solely to blame
for the ills ol professional athletics, and
that part of the blame must lie in the
camp of athletes who lost their passion
for the game long ago and now care
only alxmt pulling down the highest
salary they can. But that debate is best
saved for another day.
It simply angers me to see a great
sport being so degraded by the lure of
cash. Most unfortunate in the current
baseball example is the fact that two per
fectly gtxxl cities will lose their teams. I
mean, what's the end goal of con traction
anyway? 1 know that the owners feel
some teams aren't pulling their weight fi
nancially. Yet some arc saving that teams
are eliminated with the thought of
evening out die talent ptx)land invoking
a more competitive balance. If that's
true, I'm sorry to say that it ain't gonna
happen, folks. Noway, no how.
The Marlins, Pirates or whoever's
left after contraction are never going
to rise up and win the World Series,
just like the Yankees and Braves are
never going to miss their date with the
post-season. Not while one lives in
squalor while the other basks in the
endless vaults of George Steinbrenner
or Ted Turner.
In a sport just now beginning to re
cover from the 1994 strike that can
celled the World Series for the first time
since the turn of the century, it doesn't
seem like playing around with the struc
ture of the game is a very g(xxl idea.
Until the sport can figure out how to
fairly divvy up the money to help the
less fortunate, baseball will continue
have an ugly underside where the team
that wins more often than not is the
team with the richest owner.
The elimination of teams only helps
the rich get richer and leaves the poor
right where they are. In the mean
time, the people who suffer the most
are the fans.

chopping block, as their winters u 'ill fie n>en longer

In all mv years of watching baseball,
I don't think I've ever seen a better
Work I Series than the one that un
folded this year. 1 he Arizona Dia
mondbacks triumphantly stole the title
from the stranglehold of the New York
Yankees in dramatic fashion in the lx)t
tom of the ninth inning of (iame 7.
I hose bovs from Phoenix singlc-hand
edly restored my faith in the game.
Baseball exists tor moments like
that — lot the unbelievable drama con
tained in that final |>it(li from Mariano
Rivera to Luis (ion/ale/.. It made you,
lor an instant, enjoy life's simplicities.
I wo guys, manoa inano, pitcher against
baiter. Kat li tn ing tooutplay and outwit

the other. I he memory
of those seconds was
going to keep me pla
cated dui ing the empty
off-season.
Unfortunately, my
happy thoughts lasted a
mere two davs. Then
the team owners had to

gooll in typical fashion and muck every
thing up. Karlv this week, the baseball
powers-that-In* were sitting around dis
cussing the future of the league when
someone must have decided that tfiev
weren't making enough money. I can
imagine the conversation proceeding
like something out of an all-too-accurate
comedy sketch.
Baseball ()wner( )ne: "All right, guvs.
My accountant just gave me an update
on my financial situation, and 1 have to
say, 1 just don't think 112 can survive on
only $10 million a year." Murmurs of
agreement fill the room.
Owner 'Iwo: "How about this? Let's
foi"get the fact that tfiis is a sport fora
minute, and that it makes life a bit more
livable for millions of people each year.
Let's look at it as just another invest
ment. A business deal."
Owner Three turns to the owner of
the Montreal Kxpos: "Right. It's not
personal. We like you, Montreal, but
let's face it, you suck. You average bare
ly 7,000 fans per game, and your team
consistently represents the dregs of the
National League."
(hvner Four chimes in with the same
message for Minnesota, Florida and
lampa Bay.
Finally, a consensus is reached. The
Commissioner stands up to make the
announcement. " I wo teams have got
to go. Fifty players will lose their jobs,
and when you combine them with the
164 who are eligible to file for free
agency this year, you've got more than
200 top athletes vying for limited space
on major league ballclubs. So what?

They'll manage. What's important is
that we're saving the game here, and
oh, it doesn't hurt that it fattens our
wallets a bit."
It's a problem prevalent not only in
baseball, but in practicallv even sport
these days. We allow out teams to be
managed by a group comp(>scd primar
ily of aging men who seem to care little
alx)iit the game itself and instead fixus
all their attention on television contracts
and sparkling new stadiums. The no
tion is absurd.
Now, I will quickly concede the fact
that the owners are not solely to blame
for the ills ol professional athletics, and
that part of the blame must lie in the
camp of athletes who lost their passion
for the game long ago and now care
only alxmt pulling down the highest
salary they can. But that debate is best
saved for another day.
It simply angers me to see a great
sport being so degraded by the lure of
cash. Most unfortunate in the current
baseball example is the fact that two per
fectly gtxxl cities will lose their teams. I
mean, what's the end goal of con traction
anyway? 1 know that the owners feel
some teams aren't pulling their weight fi
nancially. Yet some arc saving that teams
are eliminated with the thought of
evening out die talent ptx)land invoking
a more competitive balance. If that's
true, I'm sorry to say that it ain't gonna
happen, folks. Noway, no how.
The Marlins, Pirates or whoever's
left after contraction are never going
to rise up and win the World Series,
just like the Yankees and Braves are
never going to miss their date with the
post-season. Not while one lives in
squalor while the other basks in the
endless vaults of George Steinbrenner
or Ted Turner.
In a sport just now beginning to re
cover from the 1994 strike that can
celled the World Series for the first time
since the turn of the century, it doesn't
seem like playing around with the struc
ture of the game is a very g(xxl idea.
Until the sport can figure out how to
fairly divvy up the money to help the
less fortunate, baseball will continue
have an ugly underside where the team
that wins more often than not is the
team with the richest owner.
The elimination of teams only helps
the rich get richer and leaves the poor
right where they are. In the mean
time, the people who suffer the most
are the fans.
