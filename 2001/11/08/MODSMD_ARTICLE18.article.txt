Sony ads perpetuate
gender stereotypes
As frequent readers of I'he Daily, we
are distui lied and offended b\ the Son\
Si reenblast ads that appealed in edi
tions of I'he Daily until f'hursday. Oct.
25. We feel that these ads. with (aptions
sin h as "I se Me." "Manipulate Me."
"Share Me" and "Enter Me plastered
across the chests of primarily female
models, send a dangerous message to
your audience. I'hey promote gender
stereotypes, object if v women and glam
orize violence against women by depict
ing domination and subordination of
women as both sew and erotic. I lie in
clusion of the token male in this ad cam
paign does not diminish the fact that
these ads portray women as physical,
unfeeling, submissive objects that men
can freely control.
Act orditig to author I ori I leise in her
World Bank report "Violence Against
Women: The Hidden Health Burden,"
each society has mechanisms that legit
imize, obscure, deny and therefore per
petuate violence. We believe that this
campaign is an example of this perpetu
ation of gender-based violence, which is
a profound health problem for women
across the globe, Civen that rape occurs
in the United States every six minutes,
sexual violence is clearly not a subject
that needs further promotion (Roxanne
Carillo in "Violence Against Women: An
Obstacle to Development").
Date rape and acquaintance rape are
legitimate dangers to a large number of
females, particularly those on college
campuses. As this violence against
women is a "form of control that limits
their ability to pursue options iti almost
every area of life," by reinforcing this vi
olence, these ads have broader implica

t ions on all aspects of women's lives (Car
illo). We feel it is inappropriate for anv
newspaper to publish ads that suggest
that this form of \ iolence against women
is acceptable.
We are very disturbed that a student
newspaper would support such gender
stercotvpcs, especially at a higher institu
tion of learning sue li as Stanford. Accord
ing to Cita Sen in her article "Subordina
tion and Sexual Control: A Comparative
View of the Control of Women," "the ef
fect [of using women in advertising! is to
reinforce the objectification of women as
purel\ sexual creatures; .ill other human
attributes are submerged." flic language
used in these advertisements both numbs
ns to the reality of gender violence and
perpetuates it through dangerously sug
gestive language.
While we support the exercise office
speech in printing these ads. we feel it is
important that you, as editors, more
carefully consider the gender messages
you are sending to your readers. We ask
that you address these concerns, apolo
gize for propagating myths about gen
der roles in sexual relations and include
a column discussing violence against
women. As I leise discusses in her report,
"Breaking the cycle of abuse will require
concerted action across several sectors,
including education, mass media, the
legislative system, the judiciary and the
health sec tor." We believe that instead of
exacerbating the problems associated
with this abuse. The Daily should assume
responsibility for giving our community
accurate and inclusive messages that
support the psychological and physical
health of women.

Preserve the good will left in the Foothills
I have been a student and lived on cam
pus for over four years. I mil last year, the
Stanford Foothills had become a central
natural feature of m\ family's recreational
life. ()f course the access to those hills has
also t hanged over that time, most dramat
ically in the last IT) months when people
can no longer "play" in the hills, picnic or
explore in their corners, or even leave the
single asphalted path. As a result, while I
still run in the Stanford hills for conve
nience, 1 take my children to Arastiadero
Preserve or the Baylands for them to ex
plore the natural beauty of California.
I u an agreement with Santa ('.lara's zon
ing board allowing Stanford expanded de
velopment rights in the Foothills, Stanford
agreed to make and preserve two useful
trails that would serve the broader com
munity, connecting with other established
trails and preserving the Foothills at least
as a crossing ground to be enjoyed en route
to other, less restricted lands.
Stanford's proposal for the placement
for the trails is abysmal, forcing "connec
tions" toother trails through major streets
and intersections. I support the Stanford
()pen Sp.u e Alliance's alternative sugges
tion that Stanford create trails to connect
directly via livestock tunnels to the
Arastradero Preserve and the Baylands
trail. 1 his will enable access to other lands
through Stanford, and to Stanford's hills
from the other lands. Well-made trail
connections would provide a broader,
vaster open space experience for people
hiking at Stanford or any of the sur
rounding areas. 1 hope Stanford will re
consider its proposal and not restrict its
natural endowment even further.

women is a "form of control that limits
their ability to pursue options iti almost
every area of life," by reinforcing this vi
olence, these ads have broader implica

t ions on all aspects of women's lives (Car
illo). We feel it is inappropriate for anv
newspaper to publish ads that suggest
that this form of \ iolence against women
is acceptable.
We are very disturbed that a student
newspaper would support such gender
stercotvpcs, especially at a higher institu
tion of learning sue li as Stanford. Accord
ing to Cita Sen in her article "Subordina
tion and Sexual Control: A Comparative
View of the Control of Women," "the ef
fect [of using women in advertising! is to
reinforce the objectification of women as
purel\ sexual creatures; .ill other human
attributes are submerged." flic language
used in these advertisements both numbs
ns to the reality of gender violence and
perpetuates it through dangerously sug
gestive language.
While we support the exercise office
speech in printing these ads. we feel it is
important that you, as editors, more
carefully consider the gender messages
you are sending to your readers. We ask
that you address these concerns, apolo
gize for propagating myths about gen
der roles in sexual relations and include
a column discussing violence against
women. As I leise discusses in her report,
"Breaking the cycle of abuse will require
concerted action across several sectors,
including education, mass media, the
legislative system, the judiciary and the
health sec tor." We believe that instead of
exacerbating the problems associated
with this abuse. The Daily should assume
responsibility for giving our community
accurate and inclusive messages that
support the psychological and physical
health of women.

Preserve the good will left in the Foothills
I have been a student and lived on cam
pus for over four years. I mil last year, the
Stanford Foothills had become a central
natural feature of m\ family's recreational
life. ()f course the access to those hills has
also t hanged over that time, most dramat
ically in the last IT) months when people
can no longer "play" in the hills, picnic or
explore in their corners, or even leave the
single asphalted path. As a result, while I
still run in the Stanford hills for conve
nience, 1 take my children to Arastiadero
Preserve or the Baylands for them to ex
plore the natural beauty of California.
I u an agreement with Santa ('.lara's zon
ing board allowing Stanford expanded de
velopment rights in the Foothills, Stanford
agreed to make and preserve two useful
trails that would serve the broader com
munity, connecting with other established
trails and preserving the Foothills at least
as a crossing ground to be enjoyed en route
to other, less restricted lands.
Stanford's proposal for the placement
for the trails is abysmal, forcing "connec
tions" toother trails through major streets
and intersections. I support the Stanford
()pen Sp.u e Alliance's alternative sugges
tion that Stanford create trails to connect
directly via livestock tunnels to the
Arastradero Preserve and the Baylands
trail. 1 his will enable access to other lands
through Stanford, and to Stanford's hills
from the other lands. Well-made trail
connections would provide a broader,
vaster open space experience for people
hiking at Stanford or any of the sur
rounding areas. 1 hope Stanford will re
consider its proposal and not restrict its
natural endowment even further.
