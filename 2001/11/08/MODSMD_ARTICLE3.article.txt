### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Amid speculation dial research
laboratories at universities tna\
have been the souk e oft he anthrax
spores used by bioterrorists in re
cent weeks. Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(l)-(lalil.) last week announced .1
plan to tighten restrictions on the
use and possession of biological
agents for research purposes.
1 'he proposal, which some re
searchers fear could slow work on
anthrax just when it is most ur
gentl\ needed, would institute
strict certification requirements
and background ( hecks for anyone
who handles certain pathogens
and toxins at at ademii labs.
It would also require universi
ties to implement security sale
guards restricting access to these
"select agents." which include an
thrax. smallpox and about Mother
potentially dangerous biologic,il
materials.
"We are a nation at risk and

suit 1 new safeguards are needed,"
Feinstein s.iid in a press release ex
plaining the proposal.
Steven block. a professor of Ap
plied Physic sand of Biological Sci
ences and an expert on bioterror
ism, questioned whether a hastily
conceived, restrictive federal polic\
would siic c essfulh address the prob
lem of ac c ess to biological materials.
"One must be very careful in
tins sort of situation that the legis
lation is foe used to address a par
ticular problem," Block said. "1
believe [this proposal | should be
subjec ted to judicial rex iew before
the rush to legislate."
I hough no Stanford laborato
r\ is currently working with an
thrax or smallpox, "as these
agents bee onie more of a potential
threat to inflict disease. . . it would
be natural to assume that there
might be a need to do research 011
them." said Assoc:. Vice Provost
l.an\ (abbs, who heads (he I ni
vcrsitv's Fnvironniental Health
and SafetN programs.

(iibbs said he could not reveal
which Stanford laboratories cur
rently possess select agents or w hat
those agents might be.
bloc k said that while scientists in
die past "have not clone a particu
larly good job of making sure their
strains are secure," new institution
al practices and a heightened
awareness bv researchers might be
more effective (hail legislative
mandates in preventing criminals
from obtaining potential biological
weapons.
"The question is whether this
legislation will wind up being bur
densome or whether it will actually
be of help," he said. "The devil's in
die details, and I haven't learned
enough about die details of this
proposal to be able to pass judge
ment on il."
Howard (iantnian, Feinstein's
communications directoi, said the
senator's proposal would do noth
ing to hinder legitimate research
on the materials in question.
"II somebocb is doing research

on anthrax, it should be registered
with the government," (iantman
said. "That's not a restriction that
w ill stop people from doing sue li re

the idea of having to register and
conduct background checks on
