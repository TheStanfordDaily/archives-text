# Smash Mouth: 'poo poo' in the '90s
## 
### STEPHEN VIGIL 
"Money, get back ' 1,1 alright )ack Keep vour hands
oil m\ slat k I hese were the words of legendan roi k mu
sician Roger Waters in H)7!V Perhaps, these words could
describe what the musi< industrv, or should I s.i\ music
business, has become todav.
I had a chance to inten iew lead singer Steve I larwell of
the San |ose-based rock group Smash Mouth before their

concert on Oct. .it I lie Catalvsi in Santa
(an/. Ihe Catalyst is a sin.ill nightclub that
li.is been liosi to man\ legendary ai is. includ
ing James Brown and Nirvana. Approaching
the interview I felt as though I were reliving
the movie "Almost Famous," as tour managers
made sure I was on "the list" as I waited be
hind the club. I spouted oil a few names given
to me In Smash Mouth's agent, and .1 manag
er looked at me and said, "Well, you said all
the right names, so you can stay here."
Shortlv thereafter, I was brought into the
tour bus to interview Harwell. Looking
around the luxury tour bus equipped with
green leather seats, I \ sand a fridge, I saw
I larwell silting at a table wearing a blue Kan
gol hat as candles flickered oil to the right. I le
ottered me a drink, which 1 gladly accepted.
We started the interview.
Harwell answered my questions with a
calm demeanor as it he had answered the
same questions millions of times. Sometimes
he stared up at the I V screen. I lowever, ii was
diflicult to decipher whether it was "Steve
I larwell the artist" talking, or "Steve 1 larwell

(lie businessman."
Smash Mouth released its self-titled third studio album
just three days after my interview with Harwell.
"You can expect a lot of fun music," Harwell said. "I
think we did a good job on this one. It's got the really cool
traditional Smash Mouth sound, but at the same time we
went a little edgier on some of the stuff and a little darker
011 a couple of the songs, lint all around it still feels like

Smash Mouth."
Smash Mouth also added a new drummer, Mu hael I i -
hano. formerb ol Cracker (remember "Low"?). Harwell
said, "| I rbauo] has made .1 big dillerence in the record.
I le has realh brought <1 lot to the table.
Aftei l ( .) ( .)9's«oinnieK i.ill\ sun ess till "Astro I .ounge." uliic li
produced hits such as "All-Star." Smash Mouth was on the
verge ol breakup. Smash Mouth had released two albums and
still lac ked a stead\ drummer, lite original drummer, Kevin

(Coleman, was ton eel to leave the band because of back prob
lems. A second drummer named Mitt h was hired, but, as I lar
well described, "I le was cool, but I don't really think he had
what it took for the band to move on."
I larwell was ready to leave the band.
"I talked to [band members| Greg and Paul and I said,
'1 can't do this anymore. I'm tired of not having a really

solid four-pirn* band," said I larwell.
I ih.mo. who had plaved on a few songs 011 "Astro
I .ounge," got I he <all and agreed on the condition that he
become .1 lull band member.
"Michael whipped evervboch into shape, lie's worked
his whole life lot this, so it's nice to have someone with
some real desire to get bigger. Now, everyone else is
pumped."
The covet of the new album features a group shot of

Smash Mouth. At fording It) I l.ti well, "People
look .it me and the\ say, 'Oh, you're Smash
Mouth Yeah, hut I'm not the guy who wrote
the song. So I tr\ to Need the credit off. . .
I'm like. I ley, these gin s are part ol the hand
too. We real Iv got to market the whole band."
"We haw one of the best songwriters in
the business with Cireg and he loves to write
songs and it's a natural thing lor him," 11.it
well said of lead guitarist Camp. But in true
businessman style Harwell said, "Not every
one tan pla\ chief in a bant I. I think the nit e
thing in our band is that everybody knows
their role. I love this business but ;it the same
time it gets hard and I want to be able to put
some of the pressure 011 the other gu\s and let
them feel what I feel even day."
Often the interview felt as though he was
representing the business of niusit and not the
art of it.
"We're kind of one of those bands that ba
sically always eoncentrates 011 writing hits,"
I lat well said." 1 here are some bands that love
playing ami writing music and we tit) too, but
we pay our bills from writing hit songs. The

most important tiling is writing songs that
radio will like."
I asked Harwell if"lie thought there was something in
herently wrong with this philosophy.
" Totally," he said. "Record labels are having a prob
lem finding the bands with the hits. So now what they are


But we're trying so hard!
doing is finding their Britney
Spears and putting bands to
gether. They are going out and
hiring the best songwriters in the
world .ind thiit's .ill they do — is
write hit songs. Ihey are the
most non-rock n roll-looking
people in the world, hut they are
the most talented motherfuckers
you've ever seen."
Harwell went on to talk about
his new record label Spun Out
Records in which he too is search
ing for hit songs. 1 think lie totally
missed my point.
To me, I larwell represented
the young boy in love with music
who became jaded by the busi
ness and is now an insider him
self. He recalled his younger
days when he idolized and im
personated Kl vis.
"Every time we would have a
Thanksgiving or Christmas
party, once everyone was getting
drunk and plastered they would
bring Steven out and they would
tell Steven to be Elvis. It was like
a capella karaoke night before
the\ had karaoke machines and
I would just make a total ass of
tin sell."
Harwell agreed that '90s
music was overproduced and
unoi iginal.

"I can agree with you a hundred
percent, cuz, motherfucker, there
was some poopmout there fucking
in the '90s. Turn the guitars up,
fiu kin' do it all. It was .1 bunch of
crap," he said.
But is Smash Mouth any differ
ent I asked?
"Nobody sounds like us. Tell
me one band that sounds like
Smash Mouth," Harwell demand
ed. Interesting, coming from a
man who also advocates styling
music after others.
"So if 1 could tell any band,
concentrate on hit songs, listen to
every fucking hit song out there
and take something from it. I'm
not saying rip it off, but take
something from it and put it to
your own band," Harwell said.
Ironically Harwell said, "Every
style of California music: we are in
one. We are a California sounding
band." Pic k up the new Citizen
King album and you might notice
some similarities.
Smash Mouth is out there per
petuating the business model of
music. Radio should not deter
mine what is good music, but as
long as people buy into this
model, music will continue down
the path of overproduction and
lack <>! vision.
