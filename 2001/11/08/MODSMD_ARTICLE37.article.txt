No Evil Star Records —

collection ol poorlv
recorded songs, with

ne\vl\-minted artist
nia\ not have properh
distilled their influ

too much like the singers thex love. And a dis< oil en lacks
the humor, warmth and energx of a live performance. An
.11 ti>t with .i killei live show tn.i\ have .i < I) that sounds
like thev've |ust put a microphone to a bootleg ol some
D.u Williams outtakes.
I he debut album of recent Stanford graduate Jenn
I.indsax. "Bring It ()n." experiences mam su< h pitlalls. Ii
is poorl\ produced and is a bit too obvious in its inllitem es
(Ani Di Franco. as one might expect from a New York
based opeuh bisexual feminist fblkie). Ii presents lb songs

sistent qualih \lter .1 lew spins, it's easier to get used to t lie
spottiness and jnsi listen to the songs, but it's neveriheless
(list 1;»< ting.
I.indsa\ herself explained that the CD is primarily
meant as .i keepsake foi those coming to the live show, so
pet haps it isn't laii to judge it bv the standards ol main
stream records. I lowever, the main question is whether or
not to bu\ the album. I or first time listeners, perhaps it
would be best to come to her li\e show first to sample the
songs and then bu\ her (.1) as a said keepsake.
The playing is capable, her voice is quite good, and the
songs .ire powerful enough to provoke and inspire, musing
on love, womanhood and a potpourri of real world prob
lems— sexual politics, domestic violence, relationship
(oniplications, eating disorders and the old staiulln ol un
requited love.
" I here are so main c lie lies about love that are available
and eas\ to fall into, because, in ;i lot ofwavs, the simplest
of them earn .1 lot of truth, l.indsav said. "But now right
now. bee ause I'm 2.'t, I'm not totalb interested in cliches."
I bus, she comes to these topics with her own point
of \ iew . and she certainl\ has something to sav on each
of them.
"Now, more than ever, people are searching for answers
.ind different pet spec lives." she Mid.
1 "his album is an unpolished gem and .1 sign of things to
come. Spoken word and angr\ sec lions 1 ling a bit too close
to the I)iFranco style. 1 lie recording level occasionalh
tnaxes out, and there are .1 number of oveth dramatic
turns of phrase, such as "And I know you've ever tasted

such a
in citing
snowy girl /
And 1 can't
taste noth
ing but my
snowed-in
world."
Still, the
(!I) holds
t oget her
and there's
more good
than had
here; her
album dos
es with
"Bells,"
which be
gins, "lliis
road is just
an album
of everv-

whore we'd j><> I'd drive to your street, kill the engine and
wait in the cold When I asked the hard questions an open
window stole \our worlds / So I watched the rearview mir
ror. watc lied your words whine and whir."
I 'd encourage anyone interested in folk music to chei k
her out next time she comes to the area, and anyone who
likes jewels in the rough to pick up "Bring It On."


Have you ever tasted such a melting snowy girl ?
