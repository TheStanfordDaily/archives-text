### JUNG LAH 
\\ hen indie pop band Sarge. (roni I rl)ana-( champaign,
Illinois, broke up in 1999. the group had onl\ released two
lull-length records. The second,"The (Uass Im.u t." earned
them more than a bit ol attention loi being named a "hot
band" in Rolling Stone, .in well as one of SIM \ magazine's 9S
bands to watt h in 1998.
But with Sarge's breakup, w hit h was shorth lollowed b\
.1 final record, "Distant," the band's singei songwriter
guitarist Kli/abeth Kltnore decided to go to law st hool at
Northwestern. T his didn't stop her from touring solo, dm
ing which slit- played both Sarge songs and new material.
The new stull eventualK turned into a part-time baud
called eli/abethelmore I.
I his p.tsi summer. Elmore released a split 7" with loi met
Braid from man Bob Nana on Iroublemati I nlimited
Records, with Kltnore s trat k being .i solo \et sion ol the lasi
unrecorded Sarge song, "You Blink." Now. lor the lit st time
in three vears. Kltnore is touring the \\ est (loast with a new
rock band, simpl) going undei the name "Kli/abeth II
more" until their first record tomes out.
Intermission: ( an vou talk about the new band and what
\ou gu\s are t ailing voursell?
Elizabeth Elmore: lot light now. we're plaving undet
iit\ name. Hopefullv, that will change when the record
i tunes out and we will suin h to a band name. Besides me,
the other band members are Sean I Inlet pla\ ing guitar. Joel
Root plaving bass and Chad Romanski, who was Sarge's
drummer, playing drums, which I'm ver\ very excited
about. I wish I could sav Chad was permanent, but I think
he's just gonna tit) the tour and the record with us.
1: When (an we ex pet t a full-length ol new material?
EE: I in hoping it will be in stores b\ late March 2002. We
go in to record it right after Khanksgi\ ing.
I: Will you be playing am Sarge songs on the current tour?
EE: It never really even occurred to me to pla\ am Sarge
songs. I'hat was a band, and we broke up, and that's that. 11
I play solt) again, I'll play from the whole selection of songs
I've written in tnv life, but I wouldn't play those songs with
another band. Sarge is over.
I: Being in law st hool, how are you going to manage being
both a student and a touring musician?
EE: I took a leave of absent e from law school this vcai I'm
very serious about recording albums— I'm not gonna put
out an album and just sit on my ass and see if anyone's in
terested. I'm in a band to play, to perform music and go
sleep on people's floors and play in clubs and evervthitig
else. Before taking the leave of absence, I was read\ to
begin my third year at law school, so I have one year left,
and some people think I'm ciazy but I'm total!) okay with
this decision.
I: What kind of law do vou intend to practice? Will there be
any connection with music?
EE: ()nt e I get my license, I'd like to be able to do pro-bono
work for friends of mine w ho are in indie bands. I think it
would be really awesome to help bands out that way. But I
have absolutely no desire whatsoever to work with the cor
porate sitle of the music industry, which is the worst side of
the music industry, and it's certainly not an area of law I'm
interested in.st) it's kind of taking two things I love — music
and law — and getting the worst sides of both of them.
I: Do you ever write any poetry or fiction? A lot of your lyrics
seem to have that kind of quality.
EE: No, 1 never really have, and it's weird because I've def
initely seen people in reviews talking about how the lyrics or
songs are kind of short stories within themselves. But I think

music kind of gives you an added lavcr of getting across
what vou're ti ving to sav. W lien vou're writing poem or a
short story, you have more loom to s,i\ what vou want,
whereas in a song, vou onl\ have the length ol the song to
s.i\ what vou're tning to say. I here's that added kind ol
emotional heft lent l>\ the niusii itself where reading Ivrit s
011 a page don't make them come across exat tl\ the wa\ the\
do listening to the song.
I: Do you ever feel like your Ivrics get too emotionalh re
vealing?
EE: I hey are reve.iling, but it's .1 ver\ controlled medium.
I've got complete control over what I see, how I present niv
self, how I present other characters within the song. Almost
all ol my songs are part-true, thev'i e all real tilings that hap
pened, although I might now alwavs be the narrator, hut I
get hassled In .ill those little math-ro( k, indie-rot k dudes in
(!hi( ago w ho re like all into their obst lire lyi us whit h re.ilh
don't mean shit, and the\ hassle me because thev're like.
"EverAthing's so open, it's too obvious, blah bl.ih blah." And
it's like, I'm not writing songs lor the purpose of being arty
in the first place, to show people how obsi ure and abstrat t I
t an be.
(Growing up in ('.hanipaign — I started when I was 19 —
I was part of this little-town music scene and when I wrote
songs, especialh lor Sarge, it w.in basicalK so that 1 could
play a show lot I.">() kids some night and see which oneol tin
friends would get diflerent lines. I'eople wouldn't know
what I'm referring to, and the lyrics would kind of just
amuse myself or my own communitx of friends, 01 some
times tliev would be to. like, totalh ream some gu\ that had
pissed tneofl — you know . J was 20, passive-aggressive and
lit kit* — and just to be able to sing the line at the show and
watch 10 faces go. "Damn!" lint I don't really worry that
much about what 1 might reveal or what I don't, because
whatever people think they might be gleaning from the
songs, they have very little to do with reality anyway.
I: 1 low do you feel about major labels? Do you see yourself
signing onto one in the future?
EE: After Sarge got a lot of press for " The Glass Intact,"
some of the major labels did kind of come-a-calling. It

w.isn't anMliingth.il really interested me. I mean, on a per
sonal side. I'm not realh comfortable around people who
take miisir and make it all business-v. It kind ol'creeps me
out. I'm not .1 part ol the punk rock and indie rock cominu
-11 it\ because it's the "best I can do, I'm .1 part of it because
I'm here bv choice. So I wasn't that tempted in the first
place, but. also. I've watt lied a million ol tin h iends' bands
get dicked over.
So. to me. it would've been .1 bad move anvwa\ — some
hod \ would have paid for lis to record, would've hated the
retord, wouldn't have released it. so vou're getting strewed
around, and I don't need to deal with that stuff, being the
front person in the band. I would've had to have dealt with
it the most.
I: \\ .is the issue more pressing .is Sarge gained popularit\ ?
EE: \\ hen we started getting .1 lot of press, people started
asking lot pictures ol just nie wlu n tlie\ did articles, flic
people in the hand wet e like. "Well what do vou think ab<nit
thatr" \nd I was like. "No fin king wa\, we're 111 .1 band.
We're not |iist gonna give somelxxh .1 picture of me. I hat's
ridiculous. ()nc magazine at tualh cut tin lac e out and used
m\ picture anvwa\ without telling us. And evet \ hod\ else in
the band w.is ver\ into the idea ol signing to .1 major, there
delinitch was some latent and not-so-latent angci bet ause I
wouldn't do it.
So I kept li ving to explain to them that the\ didn't un
derstand how tli.it shit was gonna gel ."><) times woi se the sec -
ond we signed to .1 major label, and people weren't gonna
he asking lor a pic litre of just me, lhe\ were gonna be de
manding. and that just makes me really uncomfortable
knowing that prett\ much am woman in rock has to be
letishi/ed in some way. It's just not really my thing.
I: Do \ou ever feel like you get pigeonholed with the "fe
male music 1.111" stereotvpe?
EE: I have massive issues with people 11 \i lig to c.itegori/e
inc. Irving to box me in. I mean not even that, it's like I have
problems with anyone making am issue of it whatsoever.
Nol that as a woman I'm uncomfortable being a woman —
I can he vet v verv gii l\. it's nothing like that. I just don't see
what the hell that has to do wit 11 the fat t that I play music.
I'm not looking for someone to teach me how to make ba
bies, I'm looking to see people that are good musicians, and
1 don't need women to he tin role models. Ifthe\ are, that's
great, and there.uecertainh women who have been, but it's
\ei \ very weird to me that people tend to make it an issue.
1 he stranger thing to me is tli.it women seem tohaveeni
brat eel being music ally defined l>\ their gender, and I'm not
just talking about the lolk rock chicks when the\ have t hit k
singer night, I'm talking about a lot ol women in punk rock.
I don't lint let stand why talking to certain people, they'll he
like, "()h, we tan put you this show, we've got two other girls
on that show," and I'm thinking w hat in god's name does
that have to do with anything? It (eels ver\ offensive to me
that Itan he rediKeel to that small of terms, and honestly,
gills are kind of mean and scary, so I kind of like hanging
out with guys better anywa\.
I: What's vour opinion 011 the musii ian-fan connection and
getting to know your audience?
EE: In terms of the musician-lan thing, I don't see tli.it
there's am reason there should be a difference between the
two. When people e-mail me. 1 e-mail every single person
back. I o me. if somebody cares enough to take the time to
write me a letter, the least 1 can do is drop them .1 line hack,
you know? I hev bought the record, they appreciate it, it)
me it seems very simple. 1 don't like it when people ap
proach me or any other person in the band with this sort of
power dynamic already imposed. It's very awkward because
being in a band doesn't make anyone special. All it means is
that they make music that you like.
It's hardest for me when 1 see 16-year-old girls or, God
forbid, some of these 25-year-old girls up in front of the


What's your opinion on musician-fan copulation?
stage just doe-eved. just worshipful ol
tlu' guvs on stage, and I |iisi wanna take
Ihem and be like, "You know what?
You like his band, and that's cool. But it
doesn't make linn smart, tool, nice, in
teresting, it doesn't make him a good
kisser, it doesn't make liim worth luck
ing, it means he's in a good band." I
mean, there are so many people in
bands who are sohorriblv, mind-numb
inglv boring and one-dimensional, and
it's like they just get away with it because
they're in a band.
I: How do you feel about the current
state of your hometown music scene?
EE: Chicago is like home of the skin
ny-ass, bed-beaded, model-looking,
pretty-looking rocker boys, you know?
You can't spit without hitting one of
them. And it's line, 1 don't mind, but
it's a little bit strange to watch people
being so goddamn trendy every time
they go out. I'm always a little baffled
that people still have the energy and
time to spend on putting together
their outfits.
But there are a lot of great people
in Chicago that I truh love. Whatever

... J
the aftermath has become of the kids that were in
emo .md math rock bands w hen they were 21 and
are now trving to dein ii —but are in some band
that is some evolution of that — whatever commu
nit\ vou w.i 11 na call that, it jusi sir ins to be si\ le over
substaiu e.

Or maybe the substance is there but there's so
much attention on stvie that it kind of starts toobsc ure
it at some point. I've found younger people and es
pecialK t he older ( Chicago people to beven ver\ cool,
it's just people m\ age that I'm starting to have impa
tience with — thcv're not realK growing up at all.


One of these things is not like the other, one of these things is not the same.
