Puccini's " Tosca," first performed in
1900. is the quintessential romantic
tragech. Mvtlis abound about the Illica
and Ciiacosa libretto, and San Ti ancisco
Opera's relationship with the piece is
almost as exciting. The melodrama is a
whirlwind of social intrigue, enveloped
in masterful orchestration. STO's 2001
restaging of the 1907-08 production,
which heralded the reopening of the
War Memorial Opera House, was no
ticeabh flat in the first act, but gathered
tempo .uid gravitv, and received very
warm applause.
" Tosca" is an excellent first opera for
the newcomer, but nonetheless a staple
of the Italian repertoire. The plot
which unfolds in one single evening in
Rome is both delightfully simple in
structure, vet enticingly theatrical. Be
cause of this dual nature it comes
broadly within the class of "opera veris
nio" — reality opera — the archetype
of which is another Puccini opera, "La
Boh£me."
Angelotti, a political prisoner, is hid

ing in .1 chapel as our hero, the painter
Mario C.avaradossi, reflects 011 his new
artistic commission ("Recondita armo
nia"). I pon discovering Angelotti, lie
gives him food and promises to aid his
escape. Floria Tosca, an actress, enters
the church and together the hero and
heroine sing of their love and Tosca's
jealousy. Later, as news of Angelotti's
escape from prison spreads through
Rome, Baron Scarpia, the chief of po
lite, pieces together the evidence, lie
learns that Cavaradossi is hiding An
gelotti and vows to capture hotli using
Tosca .is his bait.
In the second act, Scarpia dines
alone in his palace and prepares for the
arrival of the beautiful Tosca. Unbe
knownst to her, Scarpia's henchmen
have arrested C.avaradossi. Tosca en
ters Scarpia's chamber only to find her
lover in chains. Horrified, she tries
vainly to avoid betraying him. Cavara
dossi's cries of pain force her to suc
cumb. As he is dragged to his execu
tion, he curses Tosca. She appeals to
Scarpia ("Vissi d'arte, vissi d'amore"),
who offers her a sordid deal: her lover's

Lite lor one night of passion. But before
giving herself to her loathsome inquisi
tor, shi' procures a letter of pardon and
the promise of a feigned execution.
I hen suddenly Tosca thrusts a knife
into her tormentor's heart.
As the curtain rises on the castle ram
parts, (-avaradossi prepares for his exe
cution. He pours Ins love into a final
letter ("E lucevan le stelle"), but 1 osca
appears in time to explain the sudden
turn ol events. A touching final duet
gives vvav to the mock execution. I'osca
conceals hersell and awaits the depar
ture of the firing squad. I hen .is she ap
proaches her beloved, she realizes that
it has all gone horribly wrong. Offstage
the police discover their slain chief, and
they swoop to capture the murderess.
Tosca climbs atop the battlements and
hurls herself to her death.
"Tosca" was a part of SFO's first sea
son in 1923 and also heralded the
opening of the house on Van Ness Av
enue in 1932. Innumerable stars have
graced the stage in the three leading
roles. Indeed, the current program
notes are littered with references to

some of the world's greatest perform
ers, which sadly serves only to under
score the less-than-stellar cast in 2001.
Carol Vaness had spectators on the
edge of their seats in 1997-98. I his re
vival of Lofti Mansouri's production
featured Richard Leech as (.arvarados
si, Eva Urbanova as Tosca and Fran/
Grundheber in the role of Scarpia.
They each rose well to the challenging
opera, but Act l"wo was the highlight.
SFO's orchestra, conducted by Paolo
Carignani, was thoroughly captivating.
Tradition has it that Puccini once
wrote, "Almightv God touched me with
His little finger and said, 'Write for the
theatre — mind you, only for the the
atre.' And 1 have obeyed the divine
command." II Puccini ever obeyed, it
was with "Tosca," an opera in which
drama comes to life in music that is
powerful, passionate and supremely
theatrical. "Tosca" runs until mid-No
vember and again in January 2002.

proaches her beloved, she realizes that
it has all gone horribly wrong. Offstage
the police discover their slain chief, and
they swoop to capture the murderess.
Tosca climbs atop the battlements and
hurls herself to her death.
"Tosca" was a part of SFO's first sea
son in 1923 and also heralded the
opening of the house on Van Ness Av
enue in 1932. Innumerable stars have
graced the stage in the three leading
roles. Indeed, the current program
notes are littered with references to

some of the world's greatest perform
ers, which sadly serves only to under
score the less-than-stellar cast in 2001.
Carol Vaness had spectators on the
edge of their seats in 1997-98. I his re
vival of Lofti Mansouri's production
featured Richard Leech as (.arvarados
si, Eva Urbanova as Tosca and Fran/
Grundheber in the role of Scarpia.
They each rose well to the challenging
opera, but Act l"wo was the highlight.
SFO's orchestra, conducted by Paolo
Carignani, was thoroughly captivating.
Tradition has it that Puccini once
wrote, "Almightv God touched me with
His little finger and said, 'Write for the
theatre — mind you, only for the the
atre.' And 1 have obeyed the divine
command." II Puccini ever obeyed, it
was with "Tosca," an opera in which
drama comes to life in music that is
powerful, passionate and supremely
theatrical. "Tosca" runs until mid-No
vember and again in January 2002.
