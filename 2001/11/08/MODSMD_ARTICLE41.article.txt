# Jet Li kicks copious PG-13 ass
## 
### JUNG LAH 
First thing's, first: Jet Li's new movie, "The One," is
mindless entertainment in its most amusing form,
which is to say that this film will not challenge your
ideas about cinema or make you think criticalh about
anything whatsoever. That being said, what "The ()ne"
will do is show you over and over again, in a compact ( S0
minutes, Jet Li beating copious amounts of I'C.-Ll-ass
across multiple universes — which means mostly
bloodless, tightly choreographed fight scenes. These
occur with enough frequency that you can forgive the
various plot holes that exist within the promising but
underdeveloped sci-fi premise.

As a concept, the premise certainly has potential —
12") known parallel universes existing among a strictly
regulated "multiverse," and only Multiverse Agents like
Yulaw (evil Jet Li) and Roedecker (Delroy Lindo) are al
lowed to travel between these different universes. Ap
parently, each of us are linked in every universe by an
energy wave, and when one person dies, the leftover
energy is redistributed among the existing selves.
Yulaw discovers this fact by killing himselves in differ
ent universes, and the continually redistributed energy

begins to grow to the point that he pos
sesses snper-human powers. His ulti
mate goal is to kill off all 124 other-uni
verse-|et-I.i's in order to become "the
one." Multiverse personnel like
Roedecker must c learl\ put an end to
such nonsense by the film's conclusion.
Of course, no one is sure what will
happen it Yulaw actually accomplishes
this feat, which lias never been attempt
ed before. W ill life as we know it cease to
exist? Will Yulaw explode, implode or
become an all-powerful god? Ihe film
brings up these issues briefh but never
truly explores them, nor anv of the other
fascinating possibilities 01 paiadoxes of
iis premise, li is instead more interested
in building suspense foi the final fight
sequence between Yulaw and Ciabe
(good |et Li), an ofiicer with the LA.
C.ount\ Sheriffs Department who is tlu*
stock all-around-decent protagonist

character, complete with cutesy couples banter between
hi til sell and his wife whom he loves more than am tiling
else in the universe(s).
While Yulaw is truly the movie's badass, (rushing
cops' heads with motorcvcles he picks up off the ground
and dodging bullets while outrunning police cars .it
fifty-plus miles per hour, C'.abe iscertainh no sit-bv-the
sidelines kind of guy, often having to use his newl\
gained superpowers to annihilate everyone in the room
who mistakes him for Yulaw.
Director |ames Wong and Glen Morgan co-wrote the
screenplay for"The One," and the duo are no strangers
to the science fiction genre, having worked together <>n

scripts for the first season
of "1 he X-Files," as well as
2000's above-average
teen thriller "Final Desti
nation." Like that film,
Wong's direction in"The
One" makes the action

The One
Directed bv
lames Wong
Columbia Pictures

compelling, while his and Morgan's writing presents
the viewer with enough off-hand w itt\ banter to keep

things interesting. For example, one universe has Gore
.is the American president, while another has Bush as
pi esident (receiving .1 standing ovation in front of Con
gress for proposing a universal health care plan).
Naturally, " I he One" is not without its flaws, many
<>i which have to do with the incessant cut-editing that
gives the entire film a music-video-like feel, l'lie fast
edits also take away from some of the light scenes by not
allowing the audience a dean and total view of the feats
of super human strength being perfoimed. Additional
ly. almost even light scene is scored with LIVE 105-
style pop metal, slightly lessening one's enjoyment of
the very action sequences that are the film's strength.
Hie bottom line is this: if you're expecting "Citizen
Kane" or if you think Van Damme and Jackie Chan al
ready covered the whole fight-your-doppelganger
genre, then skip this movie. If, however, you are a |et
Li fan, a fan of martial arts films, or a fan of getting
stoned and needing entertaining filler for an hour and
20 minutes of your Friday night, then I recommend
"The One" as one of those somewhat forgettable, enjoy
it-while-vou're-watc lung-it kind of movies.

the very action sequences that are the film's strength.
Hie bottom line is this: if you're expecting "Citizen
Kane" or if you think Van Damme and Jackie Chan al
ready covered the whole fight-your-doppelganger
genre, then skip this movie. If, however, you are a |et
Li fan, a fan of martial arts films, or a fan of getting
stoned and needing entertaining filler for an hour and
20 minutes of your Friday night, then I recommend
"The One" as one of those somewhat forgettable, enjoy
it-while-vou're-watc lung-it kind of movies.


What happened to good old Shurikens?


Evil Jet Li shows off the "Lotus Flower Fluttering Fist of Fury."
