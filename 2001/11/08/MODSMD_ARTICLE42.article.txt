# Linklater moves beyond 'Slacker'
## 
### RANDY MANO 
Another "wow" of a movie has come our
way. On the heels of the dramatic euphoria
found along a narrow winding road in L.A.

called Mulholland Drive is an equally daz
zling impressionistic animated film by
Richard Linklater. That's right, the man
behind "Slacker" and "Dazed and Con
fused" has turned to animation to air his

philosophical dirty
laundry about the sta
ins of modern Ameri
can culture.
Linklater has more
recently shifted his
focus to disparate

genres — from the romantic chatter in
"Before Sunrise" to the Wild West in the
god-awful "The Newton Boys." Lin
klater has even one-upped David Lynch
with the wildly inventive and ground
breaking "Waking Life." which chroni
cles the search for the meaning of exis
tence and consciousness in today's
rapidly evolving world.
This is not to say that everyone will love
— or even like — this movie. From the get
go, I noticed how the animation made
frantic and rapid leaps to show how
ephemeral or symbolic objects and people
can be. 1 recalled the hub-bub surrounding
the herky-jerky cameras of "NYPD Blue."
People wondered why Steven Bochco

4
would do such a stomach-up
setting tiling; it turned out that
his methodology was critical
for the show's realistic feel. In
Linklater's case, his visual
style, in fact, saves the movie
from being overly high-mind-

ed and talk-oriented.
1 "lie whole slew of characters falls across
the hoard. I here are several academics
whose fields range from hard st ience to the
arts. There are fringe people — prisoners,
anarchists and hooligans to name a few.
There's also Kthan Hawke,Julie Delpyand
Steven Soderbergh, who are imaged in the
film in their likeness but present deep mus
ings about dreams and reality.
What may be surprising is how smooth
such heavy discussions roll off the screen.
Linklater's script complements the flowing
colors and lines by using periodic imagery,
visual cues and high-brow humor. I have
never been one to embrace philosophy
courses or manuscripts, but "Waking Life"

makes even the most obtuse or obscure dis
cussion palatable.
To be sure, your eyes will be stunned
(and fatigued) from the jumbled mayhem
of "Waking Life," Regardless of whether

you like the film, you will most certainly
appreciate the intricate presentation of so
many diverse perspectives on life. This is
a movie that truly deserves to be heard
and seen.


Bizarro Etfian Hawke and Julie Delpy git down.


Anarchist, hooligan or cabbie?
