Despite all its benefits, Aphex Twin's experimental ap
proach has its di aw'backs. Aphex s .11 listic decisions are soau

fvervthing said. "Drukqs" is .111 important victon 101
expet imental music. Chough ii ma\ not possess the refined
perfection o( "Richard D.James \lbuin" 01 the elegant
cleanness of "Selected Ambient Works." Aphex fwin's lat
est effort is his most ambitious and, save a lew overb out
landish tracks, is perhaps his most profound. Ranging
from relaxing to clamorous and from haunting to hilari
ous, "Drukqs" is a deepl) rewarding, wild, musical mind
luck that spans the entire gamut of artistic moods. Let's just
hope that we don't have to wait another live years lor the
next installment.
