Blackmail works. McCormack is
dreadful as Frances. Driver would give
most nurses an inferiority complex. Sub
stitute a tight plot for the girls' tight
clothes, and you'll have a whale of a time.
Moreover, Shannon can give you a few
lessons on how to dump your boyfriend.


These are some bosom-y buddies.
