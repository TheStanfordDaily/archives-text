# Coens deliver customary cool

### ERIC HAND 
I'he Coen brothers —Joel the director
and Ethan the producer — alternate be
tween quirky comedies ("Raising Arizona",
" The Big Lebowski", "O Brother Where
Art rhou") and quirky neo-noirs ("Blood
Simple", "Miller's Crossing", "l-.irgo").
While their comedies are praised for theii
loopy exuberance, in their noirs the (loens
are criticized lor camouflaging aimless plots
and empty symbols with a supremely stvl
i/cd sense of cool. W hat is so terrible about
that? I like cool.
1 heir latest noir, "The Man Who Wasn't
rhere," does indeed drift listlessly, but it is
a memorably melani holic walkthrough the
life of a post-modern mail forced to exist in
a temporal and physical hell: 1949, Santa
Rosa, California.

do to block out the incessant jabber

Badalucco) and instead focus 011 the

keep growing? W here does it tome

(oilman's business plan.
"Was I crazy? To be
dreaming of dry-clean
ing?" Crane says in one
of the many voice-overs
that lend a spy-hole into
his lively, if somewhat
addled, inner life.
Knowing that Doris is
carrying on an affair
wit 11 her boss (The So
prano's (aines (•andolfi

extoi i the necessary ven
ture capital for his "laun

Speaking of unidentified flying objects...


Sorry, I didn't mean to take that much off the top.
