I'atwardhan said tile work was .t
major enterprise.
"Apart from shooting in India, I
visited Pakistan, Japan, as well as
the United States, to try i<> under
stand the psyche that justifies the
creation of weapons of mass de
struction," he said. "What emerged
alter three years of shooting is a
kind of road movie of peace ac
tivism in a time of war."
I less added, "War and peace is not
.111 ahstra< t subject lor iis now, it is in
our faces . . I his film is a < rowning
,k hievement on that subject."

<>wr the world have a very short
historic memory and Anient a is 110
exception to this rule," I'atward
han said. "But if we don't learn
from our historic mistakes we will

l>e condemned to repeat them. So I
believe showing this film here, at
this point in lime, is going lo be
very worthwhile."
