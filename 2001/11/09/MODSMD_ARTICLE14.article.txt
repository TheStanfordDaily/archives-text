Published Since ISO I

On Wednesday, the \SSI I tidcr
graduate Senate look .ill uncon
ventional step, passing .i motion
stating, "The Senate supports
affirmative action in admissions and sup
ports more progressive I nivcrsit\ hiring
practices."
I his Senate act ion was a break Irom re
cent history, as the Senate lias not involved
itsell m political matters that extend be
yond this i ampus in « >\ci a decade.
We commend the Senate lor publicly
and formally conveying a message that
many Stanford students believe in. The
Senate's passing ol an amendment dealing
with an issue ol nation.il as well as local im
portance set au important prc< edent.
Alter the Senate's Advocao Subcommit
tee recommended the Senate support af

firmative action, senators debated the
question of whether the students who
voted them into office would support such
an amendment's content. In addition, the
Senate debated the question of whether it
should involve itsell in nationally contro
versial political issues.
According to its Constitution, the ASSI
cannot pass amendments concerning mat
ters not directly related to Stanford or na
tional college student life.
I his policy, enac ted in 1991 following a
controversial Senate move opposing the (lull
War, should continue to remain in place.
Because the Senate is an institution elect
eel by Stanford students to represent Stan
lord students here on c ampus, it should not
be spending its meetings passing resolutions
concerning: matters not directh related to

University life, such as I .S. foreign policy.
However, affirmative action is different
in that it directly affects students, faculty
and administrators on this campus every
day. Ii is therefore entirely appropriate
th.it the Senate express its views on the
matter to the administration.
()ne of the ASSl's main purposes is pro
viding a voice lot students to the adminis
tration. Because affirmative ac tion is such
an important and sometimes controversial
issue at this University and the nation at
large, it is necessary that I niversity officials
be made aware of student feeling on the
matter.
I lie senators also debated the question
of whether their constituents would sup
port the amendment's content. Rightly,
the senators determined that because they

arc elected as representatives of the stu
dent body, it is not necessary that every sin
gle student support their actions.
Like elected representatives in any
other form of government, ASSU Senators
ought to listen to and take counsel of con
stituent opinion, ultimately making what
they feel to he the right decision.
I hat's precisely what the Senate did.
While we do not feel that the ASSU
should concern itself with questions that
< learl\ fall outside <>l its domain, we find
Wednesdays Senate decision to he not only
within its hounds hut also encouraging.
We hope that future Undergraduate Sen
ales follow the precedent set this week, con
tinuing to debate and take a stand on issues
— even national ones — central to Univer
sity life.
