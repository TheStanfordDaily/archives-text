SIG Chair disappointed by
Daily coverage
As tlit* ('hair of Stanford in Govern
ment;, 1 was m.it ifit*(l to read I lie Daily's
editorial on Sept. 24. "lording Stronger
Alii.lines to Dig Deep Beneath the Sin
fare." In this piece, the editor expressed .1
sttotig interest in getting to know oti-caiu
pns student groups better, in .111 effort to
more conipleteh and responsibh serye
the Stanford comnumitv Indeed, to pro
vide balance and depth in covering the
news should be of paramount importance
and is good journalism.
I o make the effort to reach out to
your subjects and your audience is re
sponsible journalism.
However, I have been disappointed
that two high-profile events that Stanford
in Government li.is sponsored within the
last two weeks were not covered b\ 1 he
Daily. Indeed, no reporter or photogra
pher was present at either one. ()n Tues
day night, SIG sponsored a dinner with
the Visiting Mentor of the Haas ('.enter
for Public Service, Stanford alumnus
Michael I luffington.
Perhaps more notably and more im
portantly for this campus, SIG hosted a
large town-hall meeting on Oct. 29, toad
dress the impact of the Sept. I I terrorist
attacks and its aftermath on student ac
tivism. I his event, widely publicized and
with a sizable attendance, was a panel dis
cussion of student leaders â€” undergradu
ates representing 1 I different student or
ganizations, interacting with audience
members to understand how the after
math of Sept. 11 has impacted student
groups on campus, and how students
think .ihout the current situation. SIG and

the student panelists received enormous
positive feedback, and repeatedh I heard
requests for more events sin h as that one.
These two opportunities would have
been excellent ones for The Daih to reach
out to student groups on campus. What
would he a better wax to do so than to
cover .1 town-hall forum in which different
student groups got together to disc uss a
set of ininiensch important issues th.it
ha\ e aflec ted lis all?
I .1111 disappointed that The Daily has
not, despite having committed to do so.
covered two important and high-profile
events. At the very least, a reporter should
have been at both programs to record the
events ace match.
Simply collecting quotes via e-mail, to
my mind, is not effective journalism, and
does not do justice to the students who
work ver\ hard to provide a service to the
Stanford coninnmit).
Kspecialh in light of the Sept. II ter
rorist attacks in New York, Washington
and Pennsylvania and its aftermath, per
haps more than ever before. The Daily
and student groups like SIG are charged
with facilitating informed, well-rounded
and open discussions on .1 variety of issues.
Along with this responsibility comes the
opportunity to turn diverse opinions into
positive, thoughtful ac tion.
SIG, as it has been since its creation in
I 9(>3, is committed to creating forums for
the expression of all opinions and to en
courage turning words into positive
deeds. This year, our commitment re
mains steadfiist. I lowever. the importance
of facilitating such dialogue is much
greater than in recent years. It is my belief
that The Daily has an important role to
play in promoting open dialogue, and in

being thorough and responsible in being
the campus main source lor news.
I he Stanford community needs outlets
.tnd education, and it is SlG's and The
l).iil\'s responsibility to provide both.
I hope that I lie Daily maintains its
commitment to working more closely with
main student leaders throughout the
year, and to more thoroughly represent
ing the activities of its readers. I also hope
that it remains committed to providing the
In-st coverage possible of all important
campus events, especially theories that po
tentially have major positive impact on
this campus and beyond.

New Axess changes unnecessary
\ on report in last Friday's issue on
the new policy regarding course regis
tration via Axess (Nov. 2, "Axess to
force aid recipients to pre-register, p.
I). I lie manner in which this change
has been made is unacceptable.
First, the claim that the new system
cannot reasonably be modified to in
clude a registration commitment func
tion. or something similar, and th;ir pie
registration for 12 units of courses is
consequently the only alternative, is
false. Among other possibilities, one
might suggest the creation of a
"dummy" course, say, "UAC 100", that
would be worth zero units but for
which it would be required to register
before receiving financial aid. Any
computer scientist worth the paper his
