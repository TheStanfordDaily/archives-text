things to worry alxnit these days.
Sliortlv after blowing at wo-game lead, losing '1-2 to
the Cardinal on Oct. 11 at Pauley Pavilion, I CI A was
forced to suspend All American outside hitter Kristee
Porter, the all-time Pac-10 leader in kills, due to a pos
sible NCAA i ult's violation.
Without Porter anil her team-high 5.81 kills
per game, the Bruins have gone averaging
nearly two fewer kills per game and hitting near
ly 70 points below their season average before
Porter's suspension.
But with three straight losses against ranked
teams, the Bruins need a win against Stanford to bol
ster their confidence heading into the postseason
without their star player.
