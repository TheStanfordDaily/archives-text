soccer Pacific 10 Conference will

MEN'S SOCCER
Sunday: No. 3 Stanford at
California, 2 p.m., Berkeley, CA

I lie Cardinal is currently tied
with UCIA (9-6-1, 3-3-0) tor first
place with 10 points.
I lowever, Washington is nip
ping close at the Cardinal's and
Bruins' heels with nine points
and a 3-2-0 conference record.
Only three points behind the
Huskies is Cal.
"Right now. this game is key tor
[Cal's] season and we'll have to he
prepared fora team that has its

back to the wall," said head coach
Kiel Simon. "One game could
change everything around be
cause the conference i> so tight.
Any of the teams that finishes well
in these hist three games has a le

and at a NCAA bid."

games on the road.
"It should be difficult to play

looking at Cal, they've done just as
well at home."
Coming off its only tie of the
season — a tight battle with I CIA

"We'\ e had a good nine days to
prepare since the I CIA game,"
Simon said. "We 've had plenty of
time to mentally prepare for the
game and be completeh focused
on Cal since they are capable of
defeating anybody. We've been
sharpening ourselves up and
working on finishing on scoring
chances."

finding the back of the net in its
other meeting with Cal ibis season.
Stanford scored four times
while shutting Cal out on Oct. 19.
In fact, Cal hasn't gotten the ball
past a Stanford goalkeeper since
19 ( .)7. (Kerall, the (Cardinal holds a
22-7-5 lead over its Hay Area rival.
"[The Bears) are not only going
to want to avenge their loss
[against us[, but they are in a tight
race to make the playoffs." said sc
