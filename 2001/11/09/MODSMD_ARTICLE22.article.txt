MEN'S SOCCER
Sunday: No. 3 Stanford at
California, 2 p.m., Berkeley, CA

I lie Cardinal is currently tied
with UCIA (9-6-1, 3-3-0) tor first
place with 10 points.
I lowever, Washington is nip
ping close at the Cardinal's and
Bruins' heels with nine points
and a 3-2-0 conference record.
Only three points behind the
Huskies is Cal.
"Right now. this game is key tor
[Cal's] season and we'll have to he
prepared fora team that has its

back to the wall," said head coach
Kiel Simon. "One game could
change everything around be
cause the conference i> so tight.
Any of the teams that finishes well
in these hist three games has a le
gitimate shot at the conference
and at a NCAA bid."
Not <>nl\ does ibis game carry
implications for conference
standings, but it is also against
one of the team's biggest rivals,
and will be played away from the
comforts of New Maloney Field.
After its match at Cal, the Car
dinal will also play its last two
games on the road.
"It should be difficult to play
them at [their] home," Simon said.
"We played so well at home, but
looking at Cal, they've done just as
well at home."
Coming off its only tie of the
season — a tight battle with I CIA
that saw no scoring in 120 minutes
of play last Friday — the Cardinal
will be especially hungry fora win

against the Bears.
"We'\ e had a good nine days to
prepare since the I CIA game,"
Simon said. "We 've had plenty of
time to mentally prepare for the
game and be completeh focused
on Cal since they are capable of
defeating anybody. We've been
sharpening ourselves up and
working on finishing on scoring
chances."
I nlike the game against the Bru
ins, the Cardinal had no problems
finding the back of the net in its
other meeting with Cal ibis season.
Stanford scored four times
while shutting Cal out on Oct. 19.
In fact, Cal hasn't gotten the ball
past a Stanford goalkeeper since
19 ( .)7. (Kerall, the (Cardinal holds a
22-7-5 lead over its Hay Area rival.
"[The Bears) are not only going
to want to avenge their loss
[against us[, but they are in a tight
race to make the playoffs." said sc
nior defender Lee Morrison.
" I his is a huge game for them be
cause a win would really help them
in making the postseason. We
need to tome out reath to pla\ be
cause thc\ will bevel) tired up."
Cal is also coining off One ol
its most heartbreaking losses ol
the vear, as it fell to I ( LA last
Saturday 1-0 in the final min
utes of regulation.
Shutting teams out is nothing
new lor the bears, as ihey have
done thai in 12 ol their 10 games

this season. ()nl\ two teams have
managed one goal against the
Bears, while both Stanford and
I (,L\ have scored two or more.
1 he( lartliual hopestocontinue
ils line pla\. as it has not lost in its
past six games.
Leading the way is junior for
ward Roger I .evestjiie with a team
high nine goals and nine assists lor
a total of 27 points.
|nnit>i goalkeeper Andrew
Ferris has been great in the Cardi
nal* net, leading the Pac-10 in
goals-against-average with .40.
I his impressive mark comes with
the help of a stingy Cardinal de
fense that has allowed just seven
goals all season.
