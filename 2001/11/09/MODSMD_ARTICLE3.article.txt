that objects to Stanford's proposed alignments

Almost .1 year after (lie I niversitv settled .1
controversial dispute with environmental groups
regarding its plans lor future growth, the two
sides are once again at odds ovei the alignments
<>l two trails, whit li Stanford is required to dedi
cate under the (.eneral I se Permit signed last
December. A coalition of six environmental
groups has united in support of .1 position paper
that objects to Stanford's proposed alignments
and recommends alternative routes.
1 lie (il P is an agreement between Stanford
and Santa ( lara ( ounl\ allow ing the I nivei sii\
to build approxiinateh two million square feet of
academit buildings and !i,()()() housing units
over the next 10 wars. I he agreement imposed
several conditions upon the I'niversitv, one of
which is the requirement to build two trails run
ning through the foothills.
t he plan stipulates that the two trails be

placed on opposite sides of campus along the
perimeter <>l I niversit\ propcrt\ —Stanford
was given one vear to work out the pret ise align
ments of the M .tils. Now , with the agreement's
one-veat anniversary looming oil Dec . 12, local
en\n■oninent.il groups contend that the I nivcr
sit\'s proposed alignments run through lands
that are too environmentally sensitive and that
the\ contradict the guidelines of the (.1 IV

the (Committee lor (ireen Foothills, a l<x al envi

I hose opposing Stanford's trail plans object
to the fact th.it the proposed SI trail, whith
would run off of Page Mill Road on the southeast
side of campus, would be harmful to the envi
ronment and would ( toss Interstate L\S() at an
unsafe point.
"What the\ are proposing is completeh in
sensitive to i ed-legged Ing habitats." Dade said.
I lie red-legged frog is listed as an endangered
