### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Almost .1 year after (lie I niversitv settled .1
controversial dispute with environmental groups
regarding its plans lor future growth, the two
sides are once again at odds ovei the alignments
<>l two trails, whit li Stanford is required to dedi
cate under the (.eneral I se Permit signed last
December. A coalition of six environmental
groups has united in support of .1 position paper
that objects to Stanford's proposed alignments
and recommends alternative routes.
1 lie (il P is an agreement between Stanford
and Santa ( lara ( ounl\ allow ing the I nivei sii\
to build approxiinateh two million square feet of
academit buildings and !i,()()() housing units
over the next 10 wars. I he agreement imposed
several conditions upon the I'niversitv, one of
which is the requirement to build two trails run
ning through the foothills.
t he plan stipulates that the two trails be

placed on opposite sides of campus along the
perimeter <>l I niversit\ propcrt\ —Stanford
was given one vear to work out the pret ise align
ments of the M .tils. Now , with the agreement's
one-veat anniversary looming oil Dec . 12, local
en\n■oninent.il groups contend that the I nivcr
sit\'s proposed alignments run through lands
that are too environmentally sensitive and that
the\ contradict the guidelines of the (.1 IV
"It doesn't meet the goals ol the Santa Clara
(ounts Master 1 t ails Plan, said Denicc Dadeol
the (Committee lor (ireen Foothills, a l<x al envi
ronmental group.
I hose opposing Stanford's trail plans object
to the fact th.it the proposed SI trail, whith
would run off of Page Mill Road on the southeast
side of campus, would be harmful to the envi
ronment and would ( toss Interstate L\S() at an
unsafe point.
"What the\ are proposing is completeh in
sensitive to i ed-legged Ing habitats." Dade said.
I lie red-legged frog is listed as an endangered
spet ics. and, a< cording to I)ade, the I nivct sit\ "s
proposed trail runs over two (reeks that are
home to this speties.
I he environmental groups are also op
posed to the ( I trail, which essential!) follows
Alpine Road on the north side of campus and
runs partl\ through San Mateo (ountv', a fat t

the\ believe runs contrar\ to the agreement
the [ niversit\ signed.
I he environmentalists have proposed align
ments ol their own that the\ sav make the trails
mot e s.ile and less invasive to the environment.
Stanford ollit ials counter that these trails would
make deepei cuts through the tatnpns.
"\\ hat Si.inford agreed is that we would put
trails on eithei side of Our land, said Director of

invasive trails in the middle ol our land. That is
the dispute."
"It's not jllsi putting down a trail, it's ded
icating that land to the government forever.
So that will essentiallx no longer be Stanford
land, said 1 lorton.
