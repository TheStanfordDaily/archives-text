### SUNDEEP BHAT EDITORIAL STAFF 
Reports from the lac ult\ Senate's comtnittees on
academic achievement and admissions yesterday
prompted a heated discussion about c lass schedul
ing and an informative session on the merits of Stan
ford's early-decision program.
Kconomics Prof. Robert 11.ill initiated disc us
sion on the issues ofdiversit\ in grade distribution
and cone erns over class scheduling w hen he pre
sented the annual report from the (lommittee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement .it vester
day's meeting. Surveys and i orrel.itions c ompiled
by the committee reflect .1 wide distribution of
grades between departments.
"Our goal would be to achieve a desirable stan
dardization while remembering each course is its
own entity," 11 all said.
hconomics Prof. |ohn Pencavel agreed with
I bill's concern. "I think it is an important issue be
cause after talking with students, we realize that it
does affect the choices of courses and choices of
major."
" There is also much diversit\ in the number of
units." 11.ill said. "We will look .it the unit reports in
tegrated with the grade reports to see the relation of
the amount of units the department awards and the
amount of work the student does
Mall also expressed the committee's worries
about scheduling conflicts, especialb during the
morning hours. He indicated that be would like to
see more < lasses moved to nighttime hours, especial
ly in the case of sections.
I bill's suggestions met with much opposition.
Civil and Knvironmental Kngineering Prof Jef
frey KoseH expressed concern that pushing classes
into nighttime hours would conflict with important
family time.
"I would hate to see it come to a point where | Lite
classes] become an expectation," he said.
"I think it would undoa lot of what the provost and
the senate have done here in trying to balance family
life and full University pat tic ipation," he added.
Senate Chair Prof. John Rickford expressed his
hesitation because the "bout s from five to seven are
a key time in the residences."
Hall continued to support a move to nighttime
classes, responding, " I he alternative to these con
cerns is to reclaim the morning classes, but we have
a problem because everything students wish to take
is offered at 10:00."
"Classes cannot be held after three because of ath
letics. Classes before 10:00 are difficult because stu
dents get upset." he said. " I he answer cannot be
teaching only at 10:00, 11:00 and 1:00. which is our
current policy."
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet also presented minor shifts 111 the admis
sions process
" I here has been a steady pro
gression over I lit' last leu wars to
plat e less importance on at liit*vt*-
ment outside tlit' at ademic
art'iia," she said.
"We now have a si ale to identi
fy the elusive tjnalit\ of intellectu
al \ it.ilit\she s.iid. I his st ale,
along with the a< ademit and non
a< ademic m ales, aids in "recogniz
ing that loi some students acade
mic achievement is a In-product

rather than a goal."
Amidst w hat she t ailed "a beat
ing in the press," Ylainlet also tle
lentlecl the early decision pro
gram and offered specific points
on Stanford's program.
()nc argument against earlv de
c ision is that it ent ihi rages students
to "blow-oil" their senior war.
" I here is no evidence that stu
dents admitted to Stanford do
this.'' \|,unlet said. Rather, she ar
gued that earl\ decision allows
students to explore arenas impor
tant to them, including acade
mic s.
M,unlet .ilso responded to

the argument that having a sin
gle deadline is less stressful foi
st udenls.
"A trickle-clown effect would
be the consequence, and we
would have admissions extending
into the summer because \ield is
uncertain," she said.
List war Stanford had an early
admit rale of 24 percent â€” 517
students were admitted carh Sen
ate member Prof. loin Wasow was
concerned about a perception that
it is easier to be admitted carh
" I he statistical qualifications of
students admitted carh are slight
l\ stronger than applic ants of rcg

ular decision," M.unlet replied.
Din ing his report .it the begin
ning oldie meeting, Provost John
Kit heinench addressed the safety
issues ol traveling on I niversiu
business.
"Stanford ret ommentls
against, but does not prohibit,
travel to those t onntries that have
a State Department-issued travel
advisory." Ktchemench said. I hat
polit \ applies to all lat 11 It\, stall
and graduate student travel.
An\ I niversitv-organi/ed trip
that invt)lves undergraduate stu
dents travelling to countries with
a travel advisory is prohibited.
