Dear University Community:
The "Big Game" is one of the greatest rivalries in College Football.
The 104"' meeting between Stanford and Cal will provide fierce competition on the field
guided by sportsmanship with mutual respect displayed by both teams.
As the Head Football Coaches of these two great institutions it is our hope that the
Students, Alumni, fans and boosters can follow the example set forth by both teams and
that they will display a spirited but friendly environment. Our goal for this year's Big
Game is for it to be well played on the field and an enjoyable experience for fans of both
teams.
Unfortunately, in past years the spirit of Big Game has been dampened by the irrespon
sible behavior of some that resulted in fracas and property damage. We absolutely do not
condone such behavior, and encourage fans to work together to squelch any and all actions
that would be considered inappropriate or dangerous.
The tragedy of September 11"' has brought Americans together. We hope that respect for
all Americans will be displayed at this years' Big Game and we ask that you please do not
engage in "pranks" or other activities that may require the attention of police or public
safety officials. These activities may needlessly distract officers and prevent them from
responding to true emergencies.
Let us do our very best to make this year's Big Game a positive environment for everyone
to enjoy!
