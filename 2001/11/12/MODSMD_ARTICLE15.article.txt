Kven if the game its<-II is unexciting, we
can take pleasure in the long tradition ol
spoils that we arc participating in. Wc can
chuckle londlv as we reinemhet the lirst
hunting games ol oui aiu estors. and we can
smile distanth as we contemplate the great
()lympic (lames of the (Ireeks.
Modern sports as wc know tliein prob
ably began during the Rom.lll I inpire,
where the Kniperor would gr.uiouslv
sponsor exoti( and elaborate games,
called "Bread and ( in its. to appease the
discontent masses. Distracted Ironi then
oppressed lives, the masses returned ado

would be rude.
lodav. we honor this tradition bv at
tending Big (lame. \\ hen we don't attend,
however, we are rude. And I don't know
about you, but I don't want to spit in tlic lace
of the Kniperor ol Amei i< a!
More than a tradition 01 gilt. 11k>iigh.
sports arc al km it the Anient an Wav ol I ile.
Just list our virtues, and ihccotmct lion will
Ik* obvious. We are violent; spoils arc vio
lent. We are loud; sports are loud. We are
sedentary; so are spc< talot s.it sports games.
We like to eat; there is l« h ><I at spoils games.
We are fanatics; sports "lan is short lot
sports fanatic. We likecolorlul things; sports
uniforms are colorfill. We like vat ietv; there
are now almost 1,000 sports leagues in
America.
Sports are what Americans think alxuit.
Some days, I don't even read the "Busi
ness," "International" and"I <n al so tions

ol ilu newspaper. I godireitlx to "Spoils!"
\s the Sports set lion gels tlm kei and (hit k
-11. nn work is gelling hardei. hut I always
know w hat the t haltering ( lasses are saying
about Stanford.
Spoils are what Vmericans talk ahout.
I he\ are 1 lie common ground we share. We
(.1111101 talk with Furopeans ahout them
(tlx \ liaxe tlieii own kinds ol sports). And
we cannot talk ahout third-rail issues like
1 11 ilu k sand l eligii >11.
I inallx. spoils are what hung lis togeth
( i ( an von think ol am olliet cause that
brings together 100.000 people in one
plat c? (an xon think ol anyothei cause that
docs so on a inoir-tliaii-u'irl<l\ basis? \o, not
the 01 plianed kids, 01 the st,li ving loreign
cis. not even cancel or love. No, like it or
not. sports arc the onlx t ause that brings us
together, \llcl, ol all our sports, looib.ill
brings us togelhei the most.
More than just 11 umiters of people.think
ol all the resources that a loothall game
brings together. II there are 100,000 peo
ple. and eat h person spends, sax. $50 on a
in kei. S'J 011 transportation and S'J on lood.
that's v\ 100.000 that could have gone
si >11 lew here else.
I hiuk ol il from anothei perspective, if
we pooled the time and mental energy of
the millions ol people who either attend or
watch a single lot >1 ball game on I V, we have
the equivalent manpower of several medi
um si/cd corporations (01 a vear. W hat but
loothall could lotus so mam valuable re
sources on one thing?
I he onh comparable concentration ol
people and resourt es that I can think ol is a
huge artnx. and I think that is an apt com
parison. \i lines light to protect a people's
wax ol lilt*. Spoils crowds gather to honor
the Vmeric.in wax of life.
Moreoxcr sports, like wars, are a mani
festation ol what Freud tailed thanatos, the
di ivc to destrox. We like to break stu IF (re
member that game with the pent ils, where
miii and xour opponent took turns snap
ping you 1 pent ils against each other until
one ol them broke?). We like to xvatch
other people break stuff (like sports
retoidsand bones).
We come together to break stuff, and
we tome together to watch other people
break stuff.
It's not onlx pari of What makes us Amer
it an: it's part of xvhat makes us human.
We must preserve our humanity. We
must preserve our way of life. And the price
ol these things, so goes the saving, is eternal
vigilance. Just as an army must not have de
sert et s. sports croxvds must not diminish.
Stanford students have a duty not to be
apathetit timing liig (ianie week.

Peter Stan is a junto) studying human ecology, lie
thinks \I hi its t/in he educational and that athletes
Kin teach us things. This is why he imm only Nike
afrfxirel. When he's serious, he says that coaches
dionld he tenured faculty and that, if athletes have
scholars!)if>s, every other defxnlnient should offer
sdiolarships too. He wants more people to e-mail
him at fist a i r(et sta nford.edu. Remember the salty
fields of (.artluwe.
