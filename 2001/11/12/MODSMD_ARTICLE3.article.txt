uate education at Stanford.
and will canst* them to think
about Stanford in whatevei way
they can."
I ht* I hink Again tour is thus
not ex pert I'd to raise a specific
amount of money lor the cam
paign, and the program does not
directly solicit donations.
"It's a verv soil sell, if you will,
on the day itself," said Pringle.
As of the end of last month, the
campaign had raised million.
For the Alumni Association, the
goal of the tour is to educate alum
ni around the country about the
changes Stanford has rcccntlx un
dergone in its undergraduate op
portunities and programs.
"From the Alumni Association
perspective, the major goal is to
reengage alumni who live in these
regions away from Stanford, said
Howard Wolf, the association's
president.
I he tour is given added signifi
cance because mam alumni are
unaware of the changes in Stan
ford's undergraduate education.
"You should set* these alums
when they find out what's going
on," said Wolf. " I heir eyes just
light up."
The tour was supposed to Hav
el to Seattle and Orange County
earlier in the year, but these two
stops were postponed after the
Sept. 11 attacks.

According to members ol the

and those w ho .il(ended the l®<>rt

strongh positive.

Ilaner said he felt there was a
divide between alumni who loved
the event and those who tna\ have
found il excessive.
" I here was sort of mix between
people who were in awe and peo
ple who were blown away bv the
extent ol the entertainment value
of it."he said. "I thought there was
definitely a hunch of people who
loved it but also a bunch who were
like, Wow , Stanford seems lo be
spending too much on this." "
F. nglisli Emeritus Prof.
Ronald Rebhol/, who held one
of the seminars, said he felt at
times the event was overly posi
tive, but still effective.
"1 he student testimonials
were all so rosy," he said. "I don't
think all students think their un
dergraduate education is so good,
but these students did."
