### LAUREL ROBERTS 
Students browsing the maga
zine shelves .it Green l.ibran
might be surprised to find
pornographic material tucked
between the tin rent issues ol
"Playbill" and "Plavs X- Players."
I lie libran carries recent is
sues ol both "Playboy" and
"Plavgiii" niaga/incs. After one
year, the paper copies are dis
carded. but all back issues are
available 011 microfilm in the li
brary's Media Department.
"Green Library tries 10 docu
ment Ibrces that shape the social
and cultural lile ol this country
and institutions that played a
loli- in shaping American atti
tudes." said William McPheron,
curator of British and American
literature.

"Since the 19(>0s, Plavbo\'
has been a visible and inlluential
source in Atnei ic an ( ultural soci
ety," he said.
But the papei copies of both
"Playboy" and "Plavgiii" never
siav on the shell lot long. I he
magazines are stolen so fre
quently that the library is cur
rently reviewing its decision 10
stock c urrent copies ot the mag
a/ine at all, librarians said.
"We're evaluating the deci
sion to keep paper issues of' Pla
yboy' because they don't last long
enough on the shelf for anyone
to use them," said Katlmn
Kerns, the head of the informa
tion center at Green l.ibran .

7.100 periodicals. According to
Assunta Pisani, associate librari

the periodicals arcc hosen b\ dil

academic interests.
I nclet tlicit c lassilication, li
brarians s.iid, "Playboy" and
"Plavgiii" fall under American
literature.
Mc Pheron s.tid he believes
the libra 1 \ has subscribed to
"Plavbov" since the l ( .)()0s and to
" Play git I" since the l ( .)7()s.
Ihe library, however, does
not subscribe to many other
"pornographic" tnaga/ines. li
brarians said.
"We don't sttbsc 1 ibe to a lot of
other magazines like Pent
house, because these maga/iues
don't have cultural promi
nence," Mc Pheron saic 1.
riiclt of the magazines is a rela
tively now problem. Prior to the re
opening of the King Wing ofti recti
1 ihrai \ in ( )ct. 1999, all periodic als
were kept in a separate area.
I Ins room was staffed, and
some maga/ines were held be
hind the desk and released onl\
upon request.
M( Pheron said "Playboy" and
"Plavgirl" were not held in ordei to
censor eonient, but beeause the\
had a high risk of being stolen.
Now, (lie Gurrent Periodicals

not haveitsow 11 room. I hese mag
a/ines are not held behind .1 desk
,md are more susceptible to theft.
Although tlie library does have
some securit\ precautions, in
cluding checking backpacks as
patrons leave, most students s;iid
it's relatively easy to hide libran
material in binders 01 the bottom
of their bags.
Mc Pheron said he is disheai t
ened by the current situation.

"Removing Tla\bo\' from the
shell is .1 good idea, he s.iid "li s
not a matter of censorship, bin of
preserv ing matei ial."

ERICA HEIMAN/'The Stanford Daily
Though "Playbill's" and "Plays & Players' " file bins remain well-stocked,
copies of "Playboy" and "Playgirl" have the unfortunate habit of sneaking off
the shelves forever. (Perhaps in the pockets of deviants.)
