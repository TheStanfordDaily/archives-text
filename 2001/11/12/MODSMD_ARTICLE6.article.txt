Sewn of I (1-Berkeley "s a cappella groups will join
Stanford's finest crooners in ('.ubberley Auditorium
tonight for the Big Sing, an annual pre-Big Came
tradition.
Big Sing is the music world's contribution to the pt e-
Big Ciame festivities. I he universities alternate hosting
the event, just as they do with the game itself.
Since the a cappella groups at Stanford are not
sponsored by the I niversity, they require volunteers to
organize the event. I Ins year, the I larmonics, one of
Stanford's six groups, are coordinating the show.
"It's going to be awesome because it gives people in
the Stanford community a (hancc to see all the groups
and to compare them to other schools," s;iid Mike
Ybarra, business manager for the Stanford I larmonics.
"Stanford has a lot of talent, and it really shows in all the
a cappella groups."
"Plus, you just get to bash Cal.and that's always a lot

of fun," Ybarra added.
I raditionally, the Stanford groups eac b wt ite a new
song mocking Berkeley, Ybarra said. "Berkeley has
the same song every year, though, so it's kind of lame,"
he added.
When the Harmonics performed ;it Big Sing last
year, the crowd booed them off the stage.
"It's more of an exchange than a competition, but it
sucks if you're not the host school," Ybarra said.
"I lopefully we'll get enough people to come this year
so we can boo | Berkeley's groups) off the stage."
"()n the whole, Stanford groups are generally better
than Berkeley groups," Ybarra siiid. "but Berkeley has
the Men's Octet, which wins the national champi
onships every year."
The Berkeley Men's Octet was named National
Champions of Collegiate A Cappella in 2000.
1 lie octet's members boasted about their ability to
upstage Stanford's groups.
