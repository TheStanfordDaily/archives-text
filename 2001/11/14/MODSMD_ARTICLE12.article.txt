# Bioterrorism expert Block analyzes anthrax threat

### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Id the past, policy makers may
have felt comfortable dismissing
Steven Block's grim warnings
about the threat of bioterrorism.
Now the> are all ears.
The Stanford professor of ap
plied physics and of biological m i
ences will travel to Washington.
D.C., this week as a part of a group
of independent government advis
ers on national security. Though
he has been a member of the group
since 1995, the value of his exper
tise is undeniable now that the
specter of bit >ter< n ism has emerged
as a reality in the United States.
Block, one of the nation's fore
most experts on biological warfare
and bioterrorism, has long advo
cated ramping up the nation's de
lenses to prepare fora biologic al at
tack. Yet until the anthrax attacks
of recent weeks, many in positions
of power were not convinced that
the threat was sufficient to justify
signific ant expenditures.

"I think it's a case of seeing is be
lieving." Block said. "Despite the
fact that they've had warn
ings . . . the government was prob
ably reluctant to ac t in tlie absence
of hard evidence suggesting that
this was a real tin eat."
I he* hard evidence has since
come in the form of loin deaths
and several more illnesses in the
last few weeks. Bloc k believes that
the countn should have been bet
ter informed and better prepared
to deal with the complexities ol
such attacks.
" I he most glaring [defic ienc \ in
our preparedness] is that foi a very
long time the I nited States has not
put adequate resources into its
public health service," Block said.
"Our first line of defense against
bioterror attacks is not through the
military ... but in fact through
our health service."
Block lamented the private
health sector's lai k of concern
with epidemiologv and its lack of
incentive to sloe kpile vaccines the
public might need during rare

times ol crisis.
"| 1 he tut rent Anthrax vaccine]
is not a particularly great vaccine
In modern standards," he said.
"It's being made bv a recipe that
dates back to the 19405."
Because of the high cost of re
sea re hand development, it is gen
erally not profitable for .1 private
company to develop a highly effec -
tive vaccine that would c urea dis
ease with a single shot. According
to Bloc k, the government should
intervene to insure that market
forces do not create a situation in
which the public cannot obtain the
vaccines it needs.
In an article he wrote for the
|anuar\ February 01 issue of the
journal American Scientist, Block
stressed that the traditional mode
of thinking about biowarfare
would not apply in the case of
biotei 101 ism. I le spoke in defense
of the Clinton administration's
controversial allocation of $1.4 bil
lion to combat biological and
chemical warfare, calling for im
proved detection mechanisms and

increased vaccine slot kpiling.
"It makes eminent sense to de
velop improved capability against
bioweapons threats, and we should
not have to wait for the biological
equivalent of Hiroshima to rally
our defenses," he wrote.
His prescient assessment about
the urgency of bioterrorism
preparations sprang from his per
ception that rogue states and non
state actors were becoming in
creasingly willing to wage "asym
metric warfare" against militat il\
dominant adversai ies.
"A terrorist works under totalis
different constraints [from .1 state
actor | and tnav not necessarih even
care about the ellie ienc \ wit h which
the weapon is developed, and cer
tainly may not care about the in
tended vic tim," he explained.
"Anthrax in a letter is an incred
ibly inefficient wa\ of disseminat
ing anthrax . . . however, it is very
effective .is a terrorist weapon he
cause it sows panic [and] confu
sion. People have frec|itently re
ferred to these things not as

weapons of mass destruction, but
as weapons of mass disruption.
" I lie economic consequences
have been severe, the conse
quences to our nation's morale are
severe, even though the casualty
rate is relalivelv low," he said.

Since terrorists do not have to
worry about many of the consider
ations that make biowarfare diffi
cult from a military standpoint,
"It's exceedingh difficult to pro
