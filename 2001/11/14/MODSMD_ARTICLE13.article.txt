The Hoover Tower bells, which will be re-installed this spring, were removed two years ago for
restoration in the Netherlands. The bells were originally exhibited at the 1939-1940 World's Fair
in New York.

two minutes after the hour so not to

James \ngell, prolessor etneri
itis of electrical engineering and
Stanford (arilloiineur from 191)0 to
1991, said he would pla\ the bells

Angcll was also on top of the
towei with /crlang when the 1959
earthquake bit.
I here was not Itittg minor
about it. said Angcll. recalling the
towei s swa\ ing back and lorth.
"I was ba\itig the time ol my life
up there, be said.
All the book< ases around him
collapsed, but when the trembling
stopped, be was able to get to the
keyboard and pla\ .i short tune be
fore he was conyinced to desc end.

During the earthquake, the
hells themselves were not dam
aged, hut the automatic drum
mechanism was.
"Since 1989 there have been no
more noon and evening perfor
mances [because of the broken au
tomatic player]." Xerlangsaid.
"1 would need to play the hells
tnanualK at Commencement, class
( 1 falloween, memor
ial set \ i< es and when special guests
came to campus," he said.
I lie earthquake, however, was
the final straw in also getting the
bells restored, something that
\u gel I had first proposed in
1973.
"It was apparent from the lie
ginuing that the hells were not re
in. ii kabh well-tuned." said Angell.
In addition to tuning problems,
the small number of bells limited

the repertoire.
I lie bells were removed in
(anuan 2000, and, according to
Director of Restoration Craig
Snarr, three different foundries
bid for the project: two in the
United States and one in the
Netherlands.
I'lie Dutch foundry, Royal Hijs
bouts, was highh recommended
In the Stanford carillonncurs.
" I he [original] bells emitted a
cheerful clanging sound," said
Klena Danielson, Hoover
archivist. But after the restora
tion. said Danielson, it will be a
"refined instrument."
I he new cat illon will have a
total ol IS bells and a range ol
four octaves.
l'he project is funded b\ both
the Stanford President's fund and
several private donors.

The Hoover Tower bells, which will be re-installed this spring, were removed two years ago for
restoration in the Netherlands. The bells were originally exhibited at the 1939-1940 World's Fair
in New York.

earthquake bit.
I here was not Itittg minor
about it. said Angcll. recalling the

collapsed, but when the trembling
stopped, be was able to get to the

During the earthquake, the
hells themselves were not dam
aged, hut the automatic drum
mechanism was.
"Since 1989 there have been no
more noon and evening perfor
mances [because of the broken au
tomatic player]." Xerlangsaid.
"1 would need to play the hells

came to campus," he said.
I lie earthquake, however, was
the final straw in also getting the
bells restored, something that
\u gel I had first proposed in
1973.
"It was apparent from the lie
ginuing that the hells were not re
in. ii kabh well-tuned." said Angell.
In addition to tuning problems,
the small number of bells limited

the repertoire.
I lie bells were removed in
(anuan 2000, and, according to
Director of Restoration Craig
Snarr, three different foundries
bid for the project: two in the
United States and one in the
Netherlands.

" I he [original] bells emitted a
cheerful clanging sound," said
Klena Danielson, Hoover
archivist. But after the restora
tion. said Danielson, it will be a
"refined instrument."
I he new cat illon will have a
total ol IS bells and a range ol
four octaves.
l'he project is funded b\ both
the Stanford President's fund and
several private donors.
