Stanford computer program
mers won the Pacific Northwest
Regional Association ol ( omput
ing Machinen Collegiate I'ro
gratuming C'.onlest last Saturday
.ind will head to the final round
in I lonolulu. I lawaii, in March.
Stanlbrd sent three teams to
the contest at the DcYrv Institute
of I c( liuologx in liemont: Stan
ford Red. White and No.
I he Red team, made up of ju
niors )on McAlister, Daniel
Wright and sophomore ('Juiong
Do, came in first out of the 77
teams in the region.
Ac cording to Wright, who also
represented Stanford at the
At A1 contest last year, "We weir
mosil\ concerned with our chief
rival, Berkeley Blue. But of
course we beat them by nearly
200 points." I lie Red team will
compete in the world finals in
I lawaii this Marc li.
I he Stanford White team,
wliic li came in fifth, included ju
nioi Ben Blum, sophomore Sin
I long Yuen and computet sci
ence cloc toral student tt an
t iuendelman.
Hit* third team consisted of ju
nioi Sanders Chong, junior Mark
II mg and computer science mas
ters student Romain I hibaux.
All participants were chosen
in a local competition at Stanford
i>n(>ct. 13.
l-.ach team tackled eight real
world programming problems,
solving as many as they could
within the five-hour time period.
There were more than 100 stu
dents at the DeVrv competition,
one of two for the Pacific North
west region.
According to the participants,
the team structure set this contest
apart from others.
According to t iuendelman,
sharing one terminal was one of

the obstacles they had to over
come.
"Sharing the computer re
quires good strategy, such as
knowing when to let someone
else use the computet when vour
solution isn't working," he said.
"Only one person can be typ
ing at a time, and other members
have to find creative ways of
being productive," long said.
But despite logistical difficul
ties, competitors agreed that the
teamwork proc ess was a reward
ing one. " I he efforts of every
member were vital to tlu* team's
success," said Do.
1 'his is the 2bth annual con
test put on by At'.M, which has
been sponsored by IBM since
1997.
Stanford won the regional
competition last vearancl placed
1-lth at the finals. I here will be
Ol teams heading to Honolulu
this year.
Most of the Stanford team
members competed in program
ming contests in high school, and
some started programming as
early as elementary school.
McAlister, Wright and Do
also compete in online contests
hosted by Topt'oder, Inc., and
earlier this month McAlister and
Wright won a collective
$125,000 at the loptoder Invi
tational contest.
In high school, Yuen and
McAlister competed in the Inter
national Olympics for Informat
ics and Do competed in the I SA
Computing t Mympiad.
I he contest concluded with
an awards dinner, during which
the Red team received the award
for being the biggest pests.
"We submitted the most c lari
fications during the contest and
submitted one program incor
rectly 1 1 times as t lie- c cmtest c ante
to a close," McAlister said. I'hev
received mouse pads as prizes.
