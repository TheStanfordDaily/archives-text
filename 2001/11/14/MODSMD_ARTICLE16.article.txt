chandise image was more relevant than
a change in store name.

Store's merchandise line is more versa
tile than that of the Bookstore.
"We'll provide newer trends that
haven't been seen at Stanford before, not
just seasonal changes in merchandise
like the Bookstore does," Gottfried said.

Bookstore on clothes, just prices," C.ot
t fried said.
"We are definitely always cheaper,
and we offer a 10 percent student dis
count all the time," he continued.
Christina Wong, a senior who visited
the store Thursday night, questioned
the success of the sale.
"It was a good way to kick off the re
opening, but I'm not sure how much
this will improve sales in the future."
Wong said.
"I think a lot of people just went be
cause of the sale," she continued.
(iotll lied and Buchanan added that
SSI', would continue to make changes
in the Stanford Store to better serve
