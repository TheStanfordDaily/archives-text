## The 						Stanford Daily Grade inflation should be examined closely 
### 
Published Since 1S9I

In recent years, grade inflation has reap
peared as a subject of debate on college
campuses. I his treixl can he traced back to
the Vietnam War era, when students could
avoid the draft through deferments for graduate
school. Because both professors and students
knew the importance of grades to graduate
schools, professors bumped up student grades to
help them avoid the draft. Since then, students'
grades have been hard to ratchet back down.
Some also cite the increase in the quality of'the
undergraduate student population, the height
ened grading power granted to graduate stu
dent teaching assistants and demands of stu
dents who feel entitled to high grades as reasons
for the continuation of the trend.
I here is no question that grade inflation has
occurred. Kven in the past decade, grades on this
campus have increased b\ an average of five per
cent. I lowever, grade inflation is. ipso facto, not

necessarily a bad thing. While some types of
checks should be built in to ensure that grade in
flation does not run rampant in spec ific depart
ments, no type of hard numeric al formula should
be applied to remedy the situation.
I wo proposals to curb grade inflation have
been floated around college campuses in recent
years. I he first would be to put every c lass in
every department on a uniform, standardi/ed
grading scale. ()ne such proposal is a system in
which 20 percent of the students in any given
course would receive As, (*>() percent, IVs, and
the remaining 20 percent,Cs and below. 1 he
second is to modify student transcripts to show
the high, low and median grade for courses as
well as the student's grade.
I he pr<>blem with these proposals is that they
would fbstei a competitive, /ero-suin atmo
sphere in the classroom. Stanford students
enjov the comparatively' noncompetitive at mo

sphere of ilie school, and this environment
should not be sacrificed.
1 he second proposal is additionally trouble
some, because it would cheapen some hard
earned student grades. In a small seminar, loi in
stant e, it is possible that every student in the class
would bring valuable input to class and receive
an "A" at the end of the quarter. If it were report
ed that the high, low and median grade for that
class were also "A", someone reading the tran
script might wrongly assume that the professor
for the course freely handed out As to everyone.
True, some sort of regulation must be
brought to bear. Wide discrepancies in grading
now exist between departments, even within
broad areas such as social sciences or humani
ties. While disparity might exist between two
subjects graded in an altogether different man
ner, such as chemical engineering and English,
vast grading discrepancies should not exist be

tween students taking similar classes and pro
ducing similar work.
Within each department, grading proce
dures should be consistent across classes. Con
sistent grading standards will go a long way to
ward eliminating unfair discrepancies. In addi
tion, students should be aware of the criteria 011
which they are being graded. It is only fair that
students know how they will be evaluated.
Ib ensure that this happens, the registrar
should work with representatives from the de
partments to provide an annual grading report
to the provost. When it becomes apparent that
vast grading discrepancies exist between depart
ments within similar disciplines, the provost
should take general measures to equalize future
grade distributions. This solution would im
prove the problems of the current, unregulated
system while keeping us free from cutthroat aca
demic competition.
