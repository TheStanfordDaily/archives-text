## Oxford: earth's navel 
### 
Despite what students might
say this weekend about the
differences between I'(!-
Berkeley and Stanford,
there's no greater contrast than Ox
ford and Stanford. I lie former univcr
sity is medieyal. timeless and enchant
ing. The latter is modern, immediate
and straightforward. Oxford graduat
ed prime ministers and founding fa
thers before there were railroads in the
United States from which Oovcrnoi
Stanford could profit. 1 he onh thing
these two schools have in common is
the word "lord." Otherwise, 11u \ rep
resent entirely different methods of

teaching, living, study
ing .uid playing.
Stanford represents
the core of Silicon Val
ley. We have digital
languages that most
people don't even
know about. We are
surrounded In corpo-

rations whose lortunes rise and fall
with the latest product offerings. Not
so in Oxford. Oxonians do not plan
their lives around technologv, the
economy or what other people arc
buying. Their neighbors are cows,
meadows and pubs whose lortunes
don't change so dramatically. A lot <>l
land surrounding Oxford belongs to
the "commons. I hat means it's held
for public benefit. What's better, it's
easy to reach by foot. Silicon Valley
has plenty of public land, too. but it's
across highways and bridges.
Stanford lives in the future..By con
trast, the ancient buildings of Oxford
place everything into an historical con
text. The founder of my hometown,
Baltimore, graduated from Trinity
College of Oxford. His name was Lord
Baltimore. Somehow, that legacy
means more to me than living near the
garage of some guy who started a com
puter company. Cities last. Companies
don't. Oxford is filled with things that
last (and have lasted) for ages. Stan
ford, by contrast, is always under con
struction. We can't even hold on to our
own Thinker in front of Meyer I library.
We're surrounded with beige walls and
red roofs. Some people call our cam
pus "the Great laco Bell." Neverthe
less, I kind of like our buildings'south
western flair.
Our students are always rushing
somewhere (perhaps on their way to
buy tacos) to achieve something vis-a
vis homework assignments, extracur
ricular projects or job interviews. At
Oxford, students only rush to meet

their weekly tutorial deadlines. Otli
ci wise. the\ feel like they're at the cen
tei of the earth. It's like the feeling the
ancient Creeks had when they
thought Delphi was the "omphalos"
(bcll\ button)of theeartli. In the mid
dle ages, main Kuropean theologians
thought that (erusalem was the
earth's navel. All of them were right,
ol course, for their cm n time. Hut ()x
-forcl is the best place tot today's stu
dent to enjoy life and ponder the
world. It's a place of contentment.
I he Oxford model is so successful
that America's best universities have
tried to emulate it. Harvard's house
system is based on the- ()xfbrd model.
At ( Klot d, each one of colleges has
its own resident faculty, student
lounge, dining facility, library and so
cial calendar. Yale copied the same
model and even went so far as t o'throw
acid on the walls of new buildings to
make the school look older. Columbia
tried to install deans with living quar
ters into the primary student resi
dences but the program tailed. That's
because Oxford is inimitable. It is the
result of centuries of decentralized
growth among separate fiefdoms. A
splash of acid and an innovative dor
mitory scheme cannot replicate this
natural growth.
fhe allure of Oxford has drawn
many Stanford undergraduates to
study at the other "ford." There are
nearly three applicants for every posi
tion in the Stanford-in-Oxford pro
grain, which is run like a junior-year
abroad. Nevertheless, this program
could be better. Participants live on the
fringes of Oxford life. They are not a
part of the official university.
The program should be renamed
Stanford-Happens-to-be-Situated-in
()xford. Students use the libraries and
dining halls of some Oxford colleges,
but they live in their own Stanford
compound. Kven worse, they don't
have a real opportunity to appreciate
Oxford's intercollegiate life, dining
and parties.
fhe best way to experience Oxford
is as a graduate student. I hat way, stu
dents really fit in by virtue of the ma
triculation ceremony which inducts
new members into the University. It's
a prerequisite for earning a degree.
Inductees wear funny gowns (they are
also required in order to get food
from the dining hall on formal
evenings) and listen to the vice-chan
cellor tell them, "don't fritter awav
