Did the ASSU Senate ever listen to
Dr. King's dream?
Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. gave us the
noble goal of a sot ietv in whit h intlividuals
are not judged I >n the rolor of their skin,
l>ut rather the content of their character.
Why did the ASM Senate (let itle to tram
ple this dream?
I he Senate's support of affirmative ac
tion in admissions tint lei mines the hope of a
color-blind societv. Aflirniative action forces
one to considei .111 applicant's rate. Is this
wh.it King had in mind when he proposed
his dream? ( It .111\ 11 is not. because he en\ i
sioncd .1 community that did not jutlge its
meml)eisl)\ the color of'their skin. Is this not
exactly what .illii 111ative.it tion does?
1 hope this universitN and even person
associated with it desires.l (olor-blind soci
et\. As .1 renter of free thought, shouldn't
this institution support the ellorts to create
.1 culture that abhors the consideration of
rat e .is .1 fac tor in .1 person's application to
attend college? After all. we are all hu
mans. so what does the color of our skin
matter? It neither ameliorates nor deteri
orates .111 intlividual s worth as .1 person.
King stood against people and groups that
considered a person's rate, so should we
not stand side bv side with his ideal?
However, tun representatives recently
det itletl to break from that noble goal. So, I
must ask, did thc\ never hear King's dream?
()r did the\ t boose to ignore and crush it?

Stanford's trail choices are unsafe
Stanford University's attempt to foster
better public relations with its neighboring
communities appears to be just lip service.
Stanford's proposed hiking trail ease
ments would be neither useful, nor safe,
nor recreational.
Dedication of these trails should provide
safe, scenic and connective links with
planned trails in surrounding communities.
Stanford's proposal for trail S-l starts on the
southeast side of Page Mill Road and has 110
parking at the trailhead; the trail abruptly
ends where Arastradero Road goes under
Route 280. Its useless routing would en
courage hikers to hop fences to cross the
dangerous Page Mill Road / 280 underpass
fora more direct route to Arastradero Pre
serve, which the trail fails to connect to.
Similar conditions prevail on trail C-l that
starts at LI ('.amino Real and follows San
Franciscjiiito and Los francos Creeks and
Alpine Road to connect to Arastradero Pre
sent 1 . flie trail is routed along a busy road
way that is not scenic and is not safe, requir
ing the crossing of dangerous intersections.
Community proposed trail route S-l
could use existing service roads and cow
tunnels that go under Route 280, providing
direct connection to the Arastradero Pre
serve and eliminating the need to cross dan
gerous roadway intersections.

A solution to parking,
environmental problems
Alter conversing with a disturbing
number of faith Systems students who
drive SI As, I have a solution to environ
mental h\ pocris\ at Stanford. Fortunately
lor prospective freshmen, my plan solves
lor the parking crisis as well.
I will not bore you by reciting the SUV
emissions st.itistit s. We all know that these
vehit les are ven bad for the environment
indeed. ()l course, in their own defense,
drivers will pretend that they at tually use
these vehicles, perhaps in response to the
rapitlb growing problem of snow pack 011
California highways. But the numbers are
more revealing: |i Ist five percent of SUV
operators use their savage vehicles for the
reasons for which the\ were designed. At
Stanford, the number is probably more
like two percent.
However, I wouldn't suggest that Stan
ford require any of these drivers to buy
new cars. Rather, just make them actually
use the cars they already own. finis, I sug
gest that drivers of SI Vs be required to
park at the bottom of Lake Lag. The plan
will justify the ownership of the behe
moths, and clear up parking space
throughout campus tor hitherto disap
pointed freshmen drivers.
()1 course some students will still object.
1 here are. after all. the endangered bacte
ria in the Lagunita mini that might not
flourish under the weight of an Excursion
or a Jeep Cherokee. So, for SUV drivers
wlio oppose my plan on these grounds:
you may park at the Dish.

Stanford is not well served by
the Bookstore
lhe Stanford community is not being
well served bv the present bookstore ad
ministration. In its aim for higher profitabil
ity, it is 'dumbing down' the selection and
the sen ice.
First, as of a week ago, the New York
fimes Best Seller List is no longer used.
The San Francisco Chronicle's list has
been substituted. This list reflects only a
narrow slice of the United States. It sim
ply does not have the breadth of the
New York fimes list. Stanford is not just
a Bay Area university. Its students and
faculty hail from the far reaches of the
earth and expect to have broad access to
books and material.
Second, Imking for books on Central
f.ui ope. the only books 1 hat the information
service could help us find were travel liooks
on Pi ague. They could come up with noth
ing in depth on the area.
Third, after these two experiences, I
wanted to place a comment in the sugges
tion box. When I could not locate the one
that had been near the door, I asked one
employee after another where it is. I was
sent me from one to another, but none of
the employees had any idea where, or in
deed, if, a suggestion box is there. Stanford

is not ;t small, provincial institution. It de
serves better.

New York deserves our sympathy
I Ilis has not been a good year to be from
New York. Very few students at Stanford
can truly understand the sadness and the
devastation that is being forced upon New
York. In our "bubble" mentality, in the fact
that most of the students here have never
set toot in Manhattan or its precious outer
boroughs, the events of the past two
months, cannot ailed them as deeply. To
many of my friends, my acquaintances
bete, the World IVade Center attack was
unreal, a faraway explosion that was mere
ly shocking, and sad, an attack on America.
I bis most recent plane crash was a
shame to happen. I think that very few
people can understand the utter devasta
tion and grief that some of us feel, for it isn't
just a feeling of our homes being blown up,
or our families being in danger. These at
tacks are happening to the people we know
intimately and love dearly, and we are
forced to watch from afar, to experience
these horrors vicariously, and to make our
selves sick with worry because there are
only so many phone lines to flood, only so
many minutes and hours to wait to hear
something, anything, that will reassure us
that our families are indeed safe, that our
homes are still standing.
I have never experienced this feeling of
constant devastation and fear lxTore. It
hurts, it tortures. How much longer must
this last? And how, how can we go about our
days, pretending that everything is fine?
1 he Stanford bubble lias long since popped
in my mind, and I have become acutely
aware of'my surroundings, of the things that
happen in others' lives every day.
