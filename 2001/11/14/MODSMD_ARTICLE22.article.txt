create better and cheaper products, companies art
using them to protect archaic business models to
the detriment of consumers. All of their technical
solutions to prevent copying will ultimately fail.
Given enough time, someone somewhere will find
a way to defeat these measures. These companies
should focus on creating incentives for consumers
to actually buy the product, either through cheap

wards that end, they have begun releasing audio (.1 )s
with built in copy protection. II you buy one of these
audio CDs (and they aren't saying which ones have
this technology) and expert to play ii in the ( I) R( )M
drive of your computer or, alternatively, il you are
planning to download the songs to your nip.') player,
you are going to be sorely disappointed. These (IDs
can't lx- read by most CD-ROM drives. Hie record
companies argue that this step is necessary Ixrause
widespread piracv will drive them out of business.
And perhaps they are right. But that's clue more to
their business model than anything else. I lie millions
of dollars they spend on artist promotion, radio play
and music videos would not lx 1 available unless we all
pay $15 fora 10 cent disc. 11 ley've chosen to base their
business on profits earned from CDs instead of con
certs and other revenue channels.
Not wanting to lx-left out, I lollvwood is also getting
into the art. As soon as De( '.SS came along and i rac keel
the "sec lire" encryption on DVDs, the suits came out in
force and sued sites like 2600.c0m and individuals like
Andrew Bunner who posted the program oi source
code on their web site. They've basically done every
thing possible to keep us from getting our hands on the
program. With DeCSS, you can "rip" DVDs much the
same way you Gin audio CDs and with the DivX algo
rithm, which reduces the file to a fraction of its original
size, you can trade movies over the Internet with rela
tive ease. Add in the introduction of DVD burners, and
you can see why I lollywooel is concerned.
These companies have penerted the put pose of
intellectual property protection. Intellectual Prop
erty protection is established in the Constitut ion "to

promote the progress of science and useful arts, by
securing for limited times to authors and inventors
the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries.'" Notice that there is no mention made
of corporate revenues and earnings projections. 11'
protection was established solely to promote
progress in the arts and sciences, but it's being used
for the exact opposite purpose today. IP laws are
being used to stifle innovation for the sake of prof
its. Instead of utilizing technological advances to
create better and cheaper products, companies art
using them to protect archaic business models to
the detriment of consumers. All of their technical
solutions to prevent copying will ultimately fail.
Given enough time, someone somewhere will find
a way to defeat these measures. These companies
should focus on creating incentives for consumers
to actually buy the product, either through cheap
er prices or by adding additional value to the prod
uct itself. Trying to turn us all into criminals is not
only shortsighted (if we are all in jail, who's going to
buy the new 'N Sync alburn?), it is also ineffective.
Video may have killed the radio star, but only time
will tell if the Internet will kill the $15 GD.
