gies reeent.lv rele.ised a handheld radio-frequency re
mote that gives users complete control of lighting and
appliances. The device not only dims lights and turns
them on and oil, but it also enables the programming
of whole-house mood lighting. It can even randomly
control lights while the owner is away. To install the
system, you simply insert modules into wall outlets
and plug your lamps into them, then replace wall
switches with special dimmers. The system was set to
be released in October. A starter kit consisting of a re
mote, dimmer and module is expected to tost around
$80.

Polaroid's" Si Pi x Pocket I'rinter A6" makes it pos
sible to print directly from portable devices such as
PDAs. Weighing only 8.75 ounces, the SiPix will
print from any PDA that runs Palm OS 3.0 or high
er. or from Windows PCs, at a resolution of4oo dots
per inch. Financially ailing Polaroid hopes to make
up for its failing instant camera venture by powering
into the fledgling mobile printer industry. Projected
price of the SiPix A6: $149.

Micronl'C announced its Millennia XP + PC,
the first system on the market to use NVidia's long
awaited, high-performance NForce chip set. The
N Force integrates a GeForce !2 graphics chip, and
then dynamically allocates up to 32M8 of system
memory for graphics. The results are a graphics
system comparable to many standalone graphics
cards, according to NVidia. The company also
claims that the unit's integrated sound is better
than standalone sound cards. All systems are con
figurable. but Micron's sample setup for home
users retails for $1,997.
