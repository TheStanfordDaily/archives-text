## Card presents an athletic new look 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF COLUMNIST 
On Saturday, the Car
dinal men's basketball
team will descend
into lhe ht to face
New Mexico in its first regular
season game of the year, official-
Is beginning .1 season in which
the team is showcasing more

new faces than
Star Search.
After losing
four starters
from last year's
squad, the
team might not
bear much re
semblance to
the three

straight Pacific 10 Conference
(hampion teams that have
transformed our program into
a national powerhouse. Nut,
surprisingly, that may not be
such a bad thing, as the team
enters this year with expecta
tions not quite as high as in re
cent years, but with a potential
perhaps unparalleled with any
Stanford team in the past.
Kver since I can remember
hearing about Stanford basket
ball, the good qualities used to
describe the team have always
been that it plays smart basket
ball. shoots the ball extremch
well, plays solid defense, or
something else along the lines
of "fundamentals."
In (loach Mike Mont
gomery's tenure, Stanford
teams have consistently been
well-coached and well-schooled
in these fundamentals, and that
should be no different this sea
son. With junior Casey Jacob
sen at the helm, there are still
enough solid shooters to
weather the loss of Ryan

Mendez, Mike Mc Donald and
the Collins twins, and you can
definitely count 011 .1 smother
ing man-to-man defense mani
festing itself by sometime mid
season.
However, one thing I doubt
anyone has ever heard someone
do w hen praising Stanford teams
is to speak of their athletic ism.
Without a doubt, "athleti
cism" has been a sort of taboo
word among Cardinal support
ers and the main Ivnchpin of
Stanford critiques over the
years.
Supposedly, we have not
been athletic enough to take the
program to the next level. Not
.itlilctic enough to contend with
the big boys come March Mad
ness, when the stakes are raised.
Hut I am here to tell vou that (lie
times they are a changin'.
You may be wondering how
I could make that statement
onl\ after watching the Cardi
nal face a group of crusading
barnstormers with their Bibles
in one hand and their high-tops
in the other (Athletes in Ac tion)
and a team of men that unfor
tunately stepped out of the
make-believe world of IMa\ Sta
tion 2 just in time to get slaugh
tered by real, non-action fig
ures (KA Sports).
But, if you've watched Stan
ford play ovei the last couple
years, 1 think you'd agree that
it's that evident alreach just how
athletic this year's team looks .is
compared with recent years.

On Saturday, the Car
dinal men's basketball
team will descend
into lhe ht to face
New Mexico in its first regular
season game of the year, official-
Is beginning .1 season in which
the team is showcasing more

new faces than
Star Search.
After losing
four starters
from last year's
squad, the
team might not
bear much re
semblance to
the three

straight Pacific 10 Conference
(hampion teams that have
transformed our program into
a national powerhouse. Nut,
surprisingly, that may not be
such a bad thing, as the team
enters this year with expecta
tions not quite as high as in re
cent years, but with a potential
perhaps unparalleled with any
Stanford team in the past.
Kver since I can remember
hearing about Stanford basket
ball, the good qualities used to
describe the team have always
been that it plays smart basket
ball. shoots the ball extremch
well, plays solid defense, or
something else along the lines
of "fundamentals."
In (loach Mike Mont
gomery's tenure, Stanford
teams have consistently been
well-coached and well-schooled
in these fundamentals, and that
should be no different this sea
son. With junior Casey Jacob
sen at the helm, there are still
enough solid shooters to
weather the loss of Ryan

Mendez, Mike Mc Donald and
the Collins twins, and you can
definitely count 011 .1 smother
ing man-to-man defense mani
festing itself by sometime mid
season.
However, one thing I doubt
anyone has ever heard someone
do w hen praising Stanford teams
is to speak of their athletic ism.
Without a doubt, "athleti
cism" has been a sort of taboo
word among Cardinal support
ers and the main Ivnchpin of
Stanford critiques over the
years.
Supposedly, we have not
been athletic enough to take the
program to the next level. Not
.itlilctic enough to contend with
the big boys come March Mad
ness, when the stakes are raised.
Hut I am here to tell vou that (lie
times they are a changin'.
You may be wondering how
I could make that statement
onl\ after watching the Cardi
nal face a group of crusading
barnstormers with their Bibles
in one hand and their high-tops
in the other (Athletes in Ac tion)
and a team of men that unfor
tunately stepped out of the
make-believe world of IMa\ Sta
tion 2 just in time to get slaugh
tered by real, non-action fig
ures (KA Sports).
But, if you've watched Stan
ford play ovei the last couple
years, 1 think you'd agree that
it's that evident alreach just how
athletic this year's team looks .is
compared with recent years.
With Justin Davis now stin t
ing at power forward, fresh
man Josh Childress probabh
roaming somewhere along tlie
wing with Jacobsen and the
ever-exciting Julius Barnes ex

Tank Williams has just about wrapped up his Stanford career, but the tal
ented senior appears on his way to the NFL ranks.
