In out* <>l college football's most memo
rable games this season, a saf'etx named
Williams dashed past opposing offensive
linemen on a Mil/ and Innged .it .1 superstar
(juarterbai k pla\ ing in one ol Ameriea's most
hostile stadiums.
He hit the signal-caller's arm and caused
the ball to flutter in the air and into the hands
of an awaiting defender.
It was a pla\ that spurred his team to \ it to
i\ and thrust it into the national spotlight. A
photograph ol the pla\ even appeared in
Sports Illustrated.
Surelv, evervone knows b\ now that the
free safely was a (Cardinal named lank (not
Oklahoma's Rov), the quarterback was Ore

gon's Joey Harrington (not Texas' Chris
Sinuns), the defender was Stanford's Marc us
Hoover (not Oklahoma's I'eddy Lelunan)
and the venue was Ant/en Stadium (not the
('.otton Bowl).
Kerily similar to Ro\ s pla\ earlier this vear,

arrived on the Farm, he quickly realized how
fast the ac tion was on the field when he played
as a true freshman.
"My first year out on the field, I was run
ning around like .i chicken with mv head cut
off," Williams said. "I wasn't able to read the
offenses that well because 1 did not know the

From a true freshman who was thrown into
