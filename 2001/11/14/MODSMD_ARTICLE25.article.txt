# Stanford's Tank full of surprises
## Senior safety Tank Williams came out of nowhere to become one of the nation's top players 
### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
In out* <>l college football's most memo
rable games this season, a saf'etx named
Williams dashed past opposing offensive
linemen on a Mil/ and Innged .it .1 superstar
(juarterbai k pla\ ing in one ol Ameriea's most
hostile stadiums.
He hit the signal-caller's arm and caused
the ball to flutter in the air and into the hands
of an awaiting defender.
It was a pla\ that spurred his team to \ it to
i\ and thrust it into the national spotlight. A
photograph ol the pla\ even appeared in
Sports Illustrated.
Surelv, evervone knows b\ now that the
free safely was a (Cardinal named lank (not
Oklahoma's Rov), the quarterback was Ore

gon's Joey Harrington (not Texas' Chris
Sinuns), the defender was Stanford's Marc us
Hoover (not Oklahoma's I'eddy Lelunan)
and the venue was Ant/en Stadium (not the
('.otton Bowl).
Kerily similar to Ro\ s pla\ earlier this vear,
lank's spectacular eflort in Stanford's im
probable H)-42 upset of the Ducks took place
amidst much less hoopla.
ABC. broadcaster Brent Musberger did not
lobby for it to appeal on maga/ine covers.
T.SI'N did not repla\ it continuously. Colum
nists did not proclaim it to be the greatest pla\
they had seen in years.
And senior I auk Williams did not care. In
fact, being unrecognized is 1 lie story of his life.
I feel like I was definiteb overlooked out
ol high school because of an injurv," said
Williams, who was harclK recruited.
Main coaches are probabh wondering
how they let a ferocious free safety with a
linebacker's si/e. a cornel back's speed and a
too-good-to-be-true personality tlv under
the radar.
"He certainlv was a steal out of high

school. 1 ' Stanford defensive coordinator Kent
Baer s;iid. "Nobodv knew about him."
Luckily for Stanford, assistant coach Phil
Zacharias discovered the hidden treasure
along the gulf coast of Mississippi.
If the soft-spoken Williams thought that life
in Palo Alto was faster than what he was accus
tomed to in his "laid-back" town when he- first
arrived on the Farm, he quickly realized how
fast the ac tion was on the field when he played
as a true freshman.
"My first year out on the field, I was run
ning around like .i chicken with mv head cut
off," Williams said. "I wasn't able to read the
offenses that well because 1 did not know the
defensive schemes as well as I do now."
From a true freshman who was thrown into
the water and told to sta\ afloat while learning
various schemes and defensive subtleties.
Williams has transformed into a senior defen
sive anchor and leader.
"M\ experience has helped me the most in
becoming better," Williams said. "I can now
go out .md pla\ more confident Is
Ijoaust* 1 don't have to think .is
mm h on the field now."
Alter having a breakthrough
season last year with three intei
ceptions. Williams was tagged to
have a spectacular senior season,
and the Jim I horpe Award » andi
date has lived up to his billing.
During Stanford's victo
r\ al Arizona, Williams displaced
his full defensive repertoire.
Not oiil v did he inteK ept liis

fourth pass ol the season,
Williams also sacked Wildcat
quarterback Jason Johnson and
caused him to fumble, enabling
fellow free-safet\ prospe( i ( <»\

foi a touchdown.
In a game filled widi spe< t.x u
larly unusual defensive plavs.
Williams also recovered Wildcat
receiver Bobln Wade's lumble
and ran 2'i vards fora touchdown.
It is no .u (idem that Williams,

coveries and s.k ks in addition to
