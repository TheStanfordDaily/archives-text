(•(Wit', to be held Saturday at Stanford Stadium, the
l)iii/\ is running three historical Itig (•<nne nitidi s this
week. This edition dips hack in time to I 1 ) 1 )-}, the last
xear of Hill 11 alsh \ second (.ordinal reign and a rare
Hear victory. Ilie next year, Walsh resigned, Scott
Frost left to win a Xational ( hamfnonship at Xebras
ka, Tyrone 11 dlinghom came to the Farm and Stan
ford started a streak of six straight Hig dame victories
that won 7 be snapped soon. C.oincidence?
For .ill those finis expecting an offensive
showdown between two of the top quarter
backs in the country. thev certainly have an
axe to grind after Saturdays ( .)7th Hig Came.
I he Stanford-Cal match-up should have
been an aerial battle between quarterbacks
Steve Stenstrom and Dave Barr. With injuries
ending their seasons, however, the seniors
handed the reins of two explosive oflenses
ovei to inexperienced sophomores.
And the game resembled what might be ex
pected with newcomers at the helm. Eight
turnovers and over 200 yards of penalties be
tween the two teams marked one of the ugliest
Big (iames in recent inemorv .is the Bears won
24-23.
lumping out to a 14-0 lead just one
minute, I I seconds into the game, Cal (1-7, 3-
."> in the Pacific 10 Conference) held on long
enough to retain the Axe for the second
straight \car. Stanford (H-7-1, 2-0) had a
chance to take a 25-24 lead with two minutes
left, hut .i two-point < onversion attempt failed
when Colden Bear safety Matt Cli/be
knocked awa\ a Scott Frost pass intended for
I on\ (lline in the end /one.
"It was a great Big (lame, said head coacli
Bill Walsh, "ll was t\ pu al of these kinds of
games. Most often, Stanford would win those,
but we ccrtainh didn't win this one."
(lal's defense did little to help Frost in only
his second start, putting him under relentless
pressure. Throwing interceptions on his first
and last passes of the clay, Frost was 1 l-for-29
for 148 yards and a tout hdown. While he did
scramble for IM) yards on 18 carries, he also ■'
had (1 iflie ulty holding on to the ball, fumbling
twice and lateraling a ball out of bounds.
"I guess I didn't squeeze it hard enough,
Frost said. " I hose are the kind of things you
c an't do, so it was a bad play be me."
Stanford was loose with the ball the entire

game, fumbling eight times and losing two.
Along with costl\ roughing-the-passer and
personal foul penalties, the Cardinal regular
ly shot itself in the < ollective foot.
Cal experienced a similar inability lo hold
onto the football. I he Bears also posted four
turnovers on the day, including two fumbles
in the final 5: 1 ol the game. Barnes* perfor
mance shadowed Frost's, as the Bear back-up
ended the game with 1 S-for-21 for 127 vards
and one touchdown. I ike Frost, he also
threw two interceptions.
With two minutes on the clock it looked as
if Cal's defense would have its way with Stan
ford's offense. ('li/be intercepted Frost on the
second pla\ of the- game and C.al running
back I n one Edwards rambled 41 yards for
the score on the next play.
I lie Cardinal then handed the ball right
back to the Bears with a fumbled exchange
between Frost and Bookman on the second

play of the next drive. Again, Cal found tlie
end /one one play later as Barnes hooked up
with Iheanyi Uwae/uoke fora l(i-yard score.
... Ihe Cardinal defense, which played
well after giving up two eailv scores, forced
Cal to punt with less than a minute to play.
Starting at the Stanford 20-yard line with no
timeouts, Frost's first pass sailed over the
head of Manning and was intercepted In safe
ty Dante DePaola, ending the Cardinal's
chance to record another miracle victory at
Memorial Stadium.
As for Walsh, lie remains undecided about
his future with the Cardinal program. Amid
speculation tli.it he will step down from the
head coaching position. Walsh tried to focus
his attention on the BigCatne. I lowever, now
that the season is over, the entire Stanford
community waits impatiently for Walsh's an
nouncement, which should come Nov. 29 at
his end-of-the-season press conference.
