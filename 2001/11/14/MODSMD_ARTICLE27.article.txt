# No. 7 Ducks will rule Pac-10 pond with Civil War victory
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With only a few conference
games remaining, the Pacific 10
Conference will come down to the
final weekend. In a season full of
surprises, three teams are still math
ematically in the hunt for the con
ference's berth in the Fiesta Bowl.
Of the contenders, No. 13 Stan
ford (6-2,5-2 Pac-10) has the most
difficult path to the bowl, while No.
7 Oregon (9-1, 0-1) controls its
own destiny. If the Ducks beat rival
Oregon State (4-5, 3-4) in the Civil
War, the Fiesta Bowl is theirs for
the taking.
No. 9 Washington State (9-1, 6-
1) needs to beat No. 16 Washington
(7-2, 5-2) and have Oregon lose in
order to reach Arizona.
Stanford needs to win out and
have both Washington State and
Oregon lose, creating a four-team
tie for first in the conference.

I lie berth in the bowl would
then be determined on non-confer
ence record and the last time that
each team made the Rose Bowl.
I he I luskies would be eliminat
ed because they played in last year's
Rose Bowl.
Washington State won a non
conference game over Division l-
AA Montana State, a game that
doesn't count toward the tiebreak
er, which is determined by wins
over Division I-A opponents only.
Therefore, the Cougars would be
eliminated because they have one
less non-conference win.
I"he (Cardinal would then qualify'
for the bowl over Oregon because
of its head-to-head record.
However, this week the Pac-10
presidents are meeting to vote
about the legitimacy of Washing
ton State's game against Montana
State. The Cougars only played
the game after they canceled their
game against Colorado following

the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Iftlie
presidents decide to allow the
Cougar vi( tory to count toward its
non-conference victory, the (lardi
nal will l>c mathematically elimi
nated from the Fiesta Bowl. All ol
these scenarios were set up by the
games played this weekend in the
conference.
I lie key matchup of the week
end pitted Oregon against No. 20
UCLA (6-3, 3-3). Hie Bruins had
lost two straight conferences games
and needed to beat the Ducks to
stay in title contention.
UCLA was without star running
back Deshaun Foster, who was inel
igible for the game because of an
extra benefits violation.
Late in the fourth quarter, the
Bruins drove the field to take the
lead, 20-14. However, Ducks' quar
terback Joey Harrington led his
team on a 70-yard drive before
throwing a touchdown to put Ore
gon up a point.

I'he Bruins had a last second
chancetowin.but kicker Christ -i if
fith missed a 50-yard field goal .is
time expired, allowing the 1 )ucks to
escape with a 21-20 victory.
Oregon is off until its Dec. 1
home matchup with ()regoti State.
UCLA must face Southern Cali
fornia (5-5,4-3) Saturday at the Col
iseum. It is not yet clear if Foster will
be eligible for the game.
"We've got to practice right now
like he isn't going to be there."
UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
"My feeling is, I don't think lie's
going to be back. If he comes back,
it's a bonus."
Two other games had an impor
tant impact on the conference title
race. The Huskies were upset by
Oregon State, 49-24, almost cer
tainly knocking them from Fiesta
Bowl contention. I'he Beavers were
in control the entire game, taking a
35-10 lead into halftime.
In the other important game,

the (Cougars were able to continue
their Cinderella season, defeating
Arizona State (4-5, 1-5), 28-16.
Washington State was never Ix--
hind in the game, as quarterback
Jason Cesser threw for 208 yards
and two tout hdowns.
I his week, the ( ougars will face
the Huskies in the Apple Bowl as

Washington attempts to eliminate
its cross-state rivals from Fiesta
Bowl contention.
In the other Pac-10 game on
the schedule, USC. defeated hap
less California (0-9, 0-7), 55-14.
I SC . needs a win over UC.LA to
become the conferences' sixth
bowl eligible team.
