# Endowment dips by $800 million
## 
### GEORGE K. TONG 
Stanford's endowment has experienced a
dec line from its highest value of $8.8 billion to
$8 billion this vear, representing a nine percent
drop, according to I niversitN officials.
Provost John Etc henienclN cited the ailing
econoniN and slipping stock market as one of
the principle reasons behind the decrease.
" flie endowment is invested in a wide vari
ety of things, but a large part is invested in
stocks. Etchemendv said. "When the stock
market drops, so does the endowment value."
1 he government's response to the unsound
econonn has also aflected the endowment.
" 1 he Federal Reserve reacting to a bad ini
croeconomic picture c auses asset prices to fall,"
said Economics Prof. Peter Hammond. "Stan
ford's endowment then fell acc ordinglv."
I he dec line of Stanford's endowment will
have ramifications throughout the University,
even if minor ones.
" I lie drop dec t eases the endow ment payout
a bit, and so there is less inone\ for the I niver
sity budget," Etchemench said.
However, to protect against radical
changes in pavout due to fluctuations in the
enclowment, the Stanford Management ( om
panv, an entity responsible for overseeing the
University endowment, has developed a
"smoothing formula."
"As far as over the next five years, we don't
have to worry about a (significant! decline in
pavout for die- I niversitN\l it liael M< (.aflery,

president and CEO of the management com
pativ, told I lie Daily last month.
Etchemendy said lie agrees that although
the formula cannot protect the endowment, it
can stabilize payout.
" I lie smoothing formula doesn't protect the
investment performance of the endowment,"
lie- s.iid. "It smooths the pavout of the endow
ment so that | it | doesn't (liange radii ally from
year to year as the endowment value goes up
and down."
An $800 million dec t ease in the endowment
ma\ seem large to some, but officials are
putting it into perspective with the economy as
a whole.
"Although Stanford's endowment dropped
moderately, it is doing better than most invest
ment funds." Hammond said. "Our invest
ments in secure real estate partly explain why
this figure isn't larger than it is."
Despite the fact that short-term negative
shocks to Stanford's endowment are inevitable,
Etc hemendy said the I niversity lias a simple
solution for long-term security.
" I'here will always be ups and downs in the
endowment," he said. "A diversified portfolio is
the main long term protection."
Stanford is not tlieonh university that expe
rienced a dec line in its endowment. I larvard's
endowment shrunk In 2.7 percent. Ml Is In
W.l pen cm it and the I niversity of (California's by
(i.9 percent, according to the Chronicle of
I ligher Education.
Stanford now has the fifth largest endow

ment among I .S. universities, behind Har
vard, Yale, the I niversih of I exas system
and Princeton.
Ktchementk conceded that he foresees fu
ture adjustments to Stanford's endowment, but
remains optimistic.
"We expect the endowment to go up in some
years and down in othei s." he said. "We just try
to make sure that there are more up vears than
down years."
