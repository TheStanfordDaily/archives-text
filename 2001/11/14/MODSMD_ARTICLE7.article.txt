C .al-bashing, nudity and sic k humor — it must be
(iaieties time again. ('.elcbratmg its 90th anniversary
this year, the student-run prodiu lion organized by
Ram's 1 lead Theatrical Society is an annual, humor

campus" during the show.

tradition has been changed a little, has become a lit

"I like Gaieties' spirit of fun and silliness," Wit-
