Fhe rules are changing — no
longer do students have to show
up for (lass, much set loot on
campus, to earn a degree. As
technology increasingly blurs (he
line between classroom and
home, Stanford is set to confer its
first-ever virtual diplomas.
twenty-five men and women
will be among the first to gradu
ate from the Stanford ( enter for
Professional Development I lon
ors Cooperative Program with a
master's degree in computet sci
ence or electrical engineering
this spring.
Andy DiPaolo, senior associ
ate dean of the center, said the
students in this program are of .1
distinct caliber.
"()ur students are working full
time, they have families, yet they
are dedicated to a set of academic
activities," he said. "They must be
extremely dedicated to succeed."
1 his mode of learning is what
t he center calls "education on de
mand." Students can log onto
class anytime — late at night or
early in the morning — or any
where, whether down the street
front Stanford or across the Pa
cific ( )cean Mote than half live in
Northern California while the
others are scattered around the
country and around the world,
DiPaolo said.
F.ric Braun is a circuit design
engineer who lives in Boston,
3,000 miles front campus, f-.ven
so, lie's taken 10 graduate level
courses through the center.
"()f course the convenience of
viewing lectures according to in\
st hedule has been great," he said.
Kach class is equipped with
video, audio, text and graphic
equipment that records every
thing taking place inside the
classroom, making online and
on-campus c lasses identical. Di-

Paolo said every lecture is up
loaded onto the Web silt- within
two hours of the end of class.
Brawn said he does not feel like
he misses anything." I'he curricu
lum, the coursewoi k, the lectures
are the same for .ill of us," he said.
Distance learning isn't .111 en
tirely insular experience. Tech
nology makes it possible for on
line students to have direct in
teraction with professors and
classmates through chat rooms
and newsgroups.
While technology makes pro
grams like this a reality, ii also
111.ikes these classes more expen
sive. One online class through
the center costs $1,125, which is
40 percent more than non-on
line classes.
"That's because of the over
head it takes to run this pro
gram." DiPaolo said. "When you
think of the infrastructure we
need for the support systems,
there are additional cc >sts to make
that happen."
1 lie center is different from
other education programs at
Stanford in that it works jointly
with several hundred corpora
tions, and only employees from
those corporations are eligible for
the online degree.
" Phis program helps strength
en the relationship between in
dustry .uid Stanford 111 regards to
research and development activi
ties," Braun said.
Among the companies team
ing with Stanford are Apple
( oniputer, Bechtel ('.orp., (Gen
eral Motors and Pacific Bell. Di-
