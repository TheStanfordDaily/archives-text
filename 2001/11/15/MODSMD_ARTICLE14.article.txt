Big (i.line week is one ol the most ex

campouts, there's an elect ricit\ in
the air. We deride (lal lor a week, we watt li a
close football game, we get a Pat-10 win. It's
a good lormnla.

erupted at recent big (■.lines that have sent

both schools need to enjo) the healths ri

tions in mind, for this reason, the leaders ol
both univci siii(.-s. as well as the coac'lies of both
teams, have made statements this week urging
students to behave resooiisibh at the game.

I his year local polite are working closely
wit I i the Athletic Departments of both schools
to ensure that adequate sccuritv is on hand to
keep the event safe and peaceful. However,
extra precautions are still being taken. I he
Stanford Band's original scripts lot the pre
game and half-time shows were nixed for leal
that their inockerv might incite ('.al to riot. I lie
free will not be allowed on the field either at
halftime or after the game. (.encralK provat a

Yesterdav. Gal's newspaper, 1 lie Dail\ ('ali

to incite schot>l s|)irit lor Sat u it lay's game. I he
art it le, "(iet I hat li iggin' Axe,' was intended
to jokinglv talk up the Big (iatne. \ltbough
columns have the light to be droll, the result
was an inappropriate call to violence in an al
i ead\ t harged situation.
Ictld\ Millei writes, "|usi as the babv bear

pisses on the feet of the hapless tree, so too
could our giddih inebriated Iresliman on
the hubcaps of those pompous w ienei s' Saabs
and Lexuscs." Although vandalism is a serious
problem during big (iaine week, desti ut lion
of upper-class status svinbols is fail-prooi
humor. I he joke is in poor taste, but in and of
itself it's not offensive.
lint Miller continues b\ recounting a plan
told to him by a "drunk Cal fan He writes,
"We get about 10 guvs disguised in Stanlurd
outfits. You know, khakis tucked into socks,
red sweaters, ui ine stains — we have to look
authentic. We sneakilv surround the Stan
lurd 11 ee, and if we lose- we pretend to i ele
brate, hugging evcrvonc and encircling the
1 fee. I hen, in the t liaos ol wieners jumping
for jov, we take out a wide arra\ of blunt ob
jects, lead pipes and bats and beat the liee
to a pulp.''

Miller goes on to sax this this plan is a joke
.md encourages readers to "locus on winning
the Axe with honor."
But even as a joke, printing such things is
w holl\ inappropriate iti light of recent history.
Sevei al years ago the Ii ce was nearly asphyxi
ated as ('al lans tipped his cost nine to shreds.
( al It.is alrcad\ demonstrated that its students
i an be < rudely violent without input from The
Daily ( aliloi nian.
So get excited about Big Ciaine, cheer for
voin team and take the outcome in stride. It's
a rivali \. but it's supposed to be fun. And if you
operate a student newspaper, don't print in
sti net ions for In iu lung human beings.
Kvervonc from the teams to the fans to
the universities is accepting inconvenience
at Big (.ante in 01 der to keep the event safe.
It's discouraging to see such displays of such
pool judgment.
