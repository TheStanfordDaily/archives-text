Real, last week I noted something
quite interesting .11 the to|> <>l page
twool I he I).iil\. "I'alo \lto plan lot sin
dents t<» I>n\ laptop** on hold."' i lie head
line said. I was instanlb intiigtied as
I alwa\s am when I heat about issues ol
te< hnologA s overwhelming di\e into
ever\ part olOin lives — and so I con
tinned reading.
In earl\ October, the administration
at nearh\ (ordan Middle School asked
parents to consider bu \ ing 52,000 \pple
ißooks with wireless Internet t.ipahilit\
lor their sixth-grade .students. I he\ leel
that a one-to-one ratio ol laptops to sin
dents is an important r
part «>l the school's new
tcchnolog\ program,
and that laptops would JS -9k
allow kids to net
wot k resources an\ time,
anywhere. tlie^^^L
11 a I
optional. IHIHHiIH
concerns about thcequi- Sarah Graybeal
t\ and linaiu ial impat i of sin li a sugges
tion lias prompted a "pause" in the pro
grain.
At liist I wasn't sure whethei to laugh
or en at this instant remindei ol the ob
scene amount of wealth in and around
the Stanford comiminitv. Is this wli.it
middle school is reall\ like these daws, or
is this expensive initiative just one in a sc
ries of events that occui in a tow 11 pi at li
callv bin sting at the seams with c ash?
111 keeping with that vein, I also sai
(.istitallv considered the possibilit\
that the entire laptop initiative came
about |iist recently because a couple oi
salespeople lioni the new h opened
Apple store on I nivcrsit\ \\'enue took
a jaunt over to |ordan Middle School
in search of even more cash than
thev're already pulling in. I ineaii. se
riously, are individual laptops really a
necessary part ol everyday sixth-grade
liter At first thought, the notion
seemed completely absurd.
I hen again, I've heard some pcsk\
rutnoi s tli.it the world is < hanging. Kids
who can't even spell correctly are treat
ing Web sites, and the Internet is the
first line ol defense lot am random
question or unsubstantiated claim. 1-
mail has become the most prevalent
form of communication. We can buy
software that will turn our living rooms
into digital darkrooms, teat h us another
language and give us an idea ol how to
fly an airplane.
It's true that the Internet boom has
changed the world and put more know l
etlge at our fingertips than ever before,
but I wonder if there is a point w here
enough is enough, where computers
t ease to become a useful tool and mot ph
into yet another intrusion into normal
life. I've already forgotten how to add

witlionl (lie Help ola tauiilaloi. and t
worry tli.it in\ ability to communicate
via voice will be the next to go. I'here
(.in i be much contention against in\
tlaim that the integration ol computers
into the lives ol most Americans is near
ly ct Muplete.
So back to the original <|iiestion.
Should si hools i call\ be recommending
that then sixth graders become laptop
owners? I wallletl bat k and lorlli lot a
w lule on the answei to that question, but
lit la 11 \ settled oil the negative aftei lit
ting 11 i \ si* 11 as well as I could into the
shoes ola t \ pical parent. 1 know that its
important loi everyone to he computer
literate and te< hnicalh competent these
(lav s, but I can't see how that idea justi
fies the purchase ol pi it ev s\ stems.
I mii il sou argue that children do
have a demonstrated need loi a com
putet oi I licit own, i have tt» ask: win a
laptop, which insianth j.u ks up the
pi it e? \\ h\ an ißook. when mi it h of the
world operates in Window's (regardless
ol the lait itess ol that monopoly )? W liv
a wireless Internet connection, which
(an hi* 112 I.ik\ and isn't available with
even service provider? Once I get past
the part ol iti\ brain that loves let It to\s
simply for their van ing degrees of cool
ness, I have to argue that kids can reap
the exact same benefits from a rcason
abl\ pricetl desktop system for their
rooms at home.
W hen I was 12, the most I could do
on ni\ dad's old Apple lie was pl.iv a
mean game of "Raise the Mags" and ot -
casionalb produce a cute little Print
Shop birthday card on the linickv dot
matrix printer. I didn't learn how to
type properly until ninth grade, and
even then it was merely the result of a
free period (omhined with the urging ol
in\ mother.
It wasn't until I started college and got
addit led to e-mail (two events which, for
bettei or loi worse, occurred simultane
ously ) that I had a real need for inv own
mat bine and began to learn how these
things really work. Sure, I love my com
puter. but I have to admit that for each
time it makes a job simpler, there is an
other time when I curse at the monitor in
disgust because I can't make the ma
t bine tit) what I want it to do. ( omputei s
make life better, but they aren't a
panacea. As today's academic environ
ment embraces technology with such
passion, I have no doubt that pre-teens
w ill be running digital t ircles around me
soon enough. Don't rush them.
