Martin Luther King, Jr. supported
affirmative action
White fraternity members dressing up
in blackface, fivers portraying black
celebrities as pimps and hoes. Sound like
incidents that prohabh happened in Dr.
arlin Luther King, |r.\ hevtlav ? Wrong.
Both ol these incidents took place on
Auburn and Stanford tanipuses within
the I.ist month. (>ivcn that, how can any
one be so ignorant .is to believe that we
have anything approat hing King's \ ision
ol rat ial equality in this country?
I am tired of seeing King's comments
on racial equality being misconstrued and
misinterpreted as support loi the abolish
ment of affirmative action. King unequiv
ocal h supported social engineering as a
means of achieving integration of the
races. In the book " I estainent and I lope:
Essential Writings and Spect lies of Martin
I Aitlier King," there are intera iewsol King
in which he dearly expresses his support
for programs such as affirmative at tion.
"White Americans must recogni/.c that
justice lot black people can not be achieved
without radical changes in the strut tine ol
our society. The comfortable, entrcnt bed,
the privileged t annot continue to tremble
at the prospect of change ol the status
quo," King said in 1007.
In a separate work by Stephen B.
Oates, King says this: "A society that has
done something special against the Negro
lor hundreds of years must now do some
thing special lor the Negro."
I hope that these ({notes will prevent
those who do not intimately know the
teachings of King from being swayed by
affirmative action opponents who use his
words as propaganda for their cause.

Martin Luther King, Jr. supported
affirmative action
White fraternity members dressing up
in blackface, fivers portraying black
celebrities as pimps and hoes. Sound like
incidents that prohabh happened in Dr.
arlin Luther King, |r.\ hevtlav ? Wrong.
Both ol these incidents took place on
Auburn and Stanford tanipuses within
the I.ist month. (>ivcn that, how can any
one be so ignorant .is to believe that we
have anything approat hing King's \ ision
ol rat ial equality in this country?
I am tired of seeing King's comments
on racial equality being misconstrued and
misinterpreted as support loi the abolish
ment of affirmative action. King unequiv
ocal h supported social engineering as a
means of achieving integration of the
races. In the book " I estainent and I lope:
Essential Writings and Spect lies of Martin
I Aitlier King," there are intera iewsol King
in which he dearly expresses his support
for programs such as affirmative at tion.
"White Americans must recogni/.c that
justice lot black people can not be achieved
without radical changes in the strut tine ol
our society. The comfortable, entrcnt bed,
the privileged t annot continue to tremble
at the prospect of change ol the status
quo," King said in 1007.
In a separate work by Stephen B.
Oates, King says this: "A society that has
done something special against the Negro
lor hundreds of years must now do some
thing special lor the Negro."
I hope that these ({notes will prevent
those who do not intimately know the
teachings of King from being swayed by
affirmative action opponents who use his
words as propaganda for their cause.

One quarter is plenty of time to
appreciate Oxford
I spent two qu.ii la s hist \(Mi .it Si.in
lord's ccntei in ()\lor<l. I agree that (here
are main areas in which the program
could he heiiei integrated into univet sii\
life. As com tort ing as it is to retreat to a sale
haven ol Stanford students from the freez
ing lain .ind |».isi \. snark\ British, cotillon
is not what sind\ ing abroad is ahout.
However, I feel compelled to defend
the progi"am against (iaudet's suggestion
tli.it a student needs two vears to "appre
ciate the delights of Oxford.' lb me, thai
sounds like a shorter sia\ is not worth
leaving the laniiliarit\ of your Draw
group and .1 mad cow-free dining hall he
hind. lo give this impression would be
unfair and a great loss to anvone discour
aged from 1 he program.
On our second da\ at the (enter, we
were warned that Oxford students' atti
tude towards newcomers is considerably
diflcrcnt from Residential Kducation's.
Becoming a pari of student life re(juires ef
fort, and more than a little patience to en
dure the sneers ol "()h, you're Amcrkan"
that greet vour lirst ,il tempi sal Iriendship.
As ;i result, even minor breakthroughs
have a satisfaction and genuineness to
I hem that superficial Sianlord acquain
tances do not.
In six months in ( Klord, I made some
treasured Stanford friends. I also joined
the Magdalen ( ollege lux kev team, got to
know Oxford students who showed me
the secret laundry room and some of the
best views ol the (il\ and made time for
many of the activities that (iaudet's friend
missed. ()f course you cannot absorb in a
three- to nine-month visit what you would
in two years as a student. But it is part of
Oxford's magic that even a brief visit can
yield the inspiration that it does.

\ good I nglisli friend once said to me,
A 011 Anicrii .ins. wh\ do you need to act
so biis\ .ill the lime?" I believe this is the
most import.mt distinction between the
two "lords. For all ol its intellectual
grandeur, perhaps the most important
thing I learned 111 Oxlbrd was to be still
and appi c( iate. I'd eiu 011 rage anyone in
terested to liiul out lor themselves what
