# WORLD VIEWPOINT
## Government ban on virtual porn goes too far 
### SANDEEP GOPALAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
I lie Supremo Court last mouth heard
arguments about the constitutionality of
provisions of the Child Pornography
Prevention \ct of 199b. Ihe Act crimi
nalizes pornograpln that "appears to"
and "conveys the impression" that chil
dren are being depii ted in .1 sexually ex
|>l i( ii manner. I lie law did not survive a
challenge before the 9th I S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, and the Supreme
Court is mow presented with .111 oppor
tunity to I.»\ down the law and re-enter
the pornography debate for the first time
in years.
l'he issue is clearly not one about the
acceptability of child pornographv. By
universal acclamation, that is ,1 blot 011
humanity. I he confounding question
tli.it must be answered relates to the crim
inalization of pornograpln that appears
to depict children, does not in fact do
that. Inothei words, does something that
looks like child pornograpln deserve to
be treated on par with the real evil?
I he Free Speet Ii (Coalition, w hit li ini
tiated the < hallengc to the law, contends
that l>\ proscribing images that do not in
volve real children, the ad expands the

over-breadth of the child pornograpln
prohibition to the point ol unconstitu
tionality. l'he government replies that
the act will make it easier to obtain con
\i( lions for child pornographv. and that
defendants 1 an prove their innocence by
proving tli.it the images were produced
using adults.
I lie government has argued that vir
tual child pornography—images that
neither depict real children nor use
them in its production — deserves no
First Amendment protection because the
images t an lead to actual t hilcl molesta
tion. I his is predicated 011 Congression
al findings that sin Ii images max "wliei
the appetite of potential molesters and
t .111 be used to seduce 1 hildren.
I he argument will be tliffit ult to sus
tain before the Supreme Court. I lie
First Amendment does not allow 1 lie sup
pression of speech that may cause some
people to engage in illegal .it is unless the
speet h was directed at arriving .11 that 1 e
sult and was likely to at hieve it.
l'he government speciously argues,
"Congress regarded the material cov
ered In [the act | .is .1 tool of the (lime of
t liild abuse nuu Ii like burglars' tools are
instruments of the 1 rime of burglary."
I "his is tantamount to s.i\ini> that

candy and money should be banned be
cause both of those could be used by pe
dophiles to abuse ( hildren. ()r, tli.it the
possession til screwdrivers and drills
should be punished.
I he 9th Circuit, while striking down
the portions of the law as unconstitu
tional, concluded that there is no
"demonstrated basis to link computer
generated images w itli harm to real 1 hil
dren." I lie truth of that conclusion is as
clear as davlight. Pedophilia is as old as
the ancient Creeks.
1 here are no studies to show a defi
nite i.uis.il link between pornograpln
1 li.it appe.ll s to tlepit t children, and dan
ger to children, just as there are none
that show an increase in murders be
cause <>t movies about serial killcis. Per
verse human nature does not flare as a
mere consequence of flic kcring images.
I he 9th Circuit's ruling appears to
have substantial logical strength. Crimi
nal lial>ilii\ cannot be premised on ap
pearances. I low can one definitively tell
age l>\ looks? Is there a telling difference
between a person who is 17 years and
:w> I da\s ,md the other who is IS vears
old, in terms of what tlie\ look like?
It is bet ause of 1 he impossibility of such
a determination on the basis of looks

alone that the law has been sh\ of impos
ing lial>ilit\ on the basis of appeal ant es.
NO one argues that an adult lias ,i First
Amendment right to show what appears
to he child pornograpln to t hildren. Put
that is not the niisi hief that the \( 1 seeks
to tat kle. I be At t overreaches and ( 1 un
itializes possession of inateii.il that ap
pears t<> be (liild pornographv, but in
fact is not, even if the person in posses
sion never contemplated it to be dis
played to at liild.
1 bus someone who rented tno\ ies like
"Traflic" or "l.olita, which convexs the
impression ol se\ involving a child, could
open themselves to criminal liability.
Criminalization must not be treated
lightly. Child pornography and pe
dophilia have no defense. I hey arc
morally reprehensible and deserve to
bear the full brunt of the law. Hut while
attempting a cure, we would do well to
remember (bat inimitable admonition
from benjamin Franklin. " I he\ 1 hat can
give up essential libert\ to obtain .1 little
temporary s.ilet\ dfcserve neithei liberty
nor safety."
