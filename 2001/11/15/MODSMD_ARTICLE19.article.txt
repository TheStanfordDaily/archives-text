In an eflbrt to unite students and dis
solve (li(|iies, a team of seven Stanford stu
dents has( rented the newly-launt heel (Hub
Nexus, an Internet portal with communi
ty-building aspirations.
(Hub Nexus strives to "bring the Stan
ford community ( loser together by break
ing down the sometimes impenetrable
freshman dorm cliques and the depart
mental myopia experienced In graduate
students," said Tyler Ziemann, a senior
,md one of the site's creators.

Intended to be an entirely separate enti
ty from the existing "My.Stanford" portal,
(Hub Nexus focuses on seven features:
"You," a tally system through which the
most at live students can win prizes; an arti
(les page; chat rooms; "Kvents," where stu
dents can learn about and post event infor
mation; "Board," a discussion forum; "Re
view," a guide to campus and area restau
rants ,ukl dubs where students can submit
their own reviews; and "Nexus Net," the
portal's most innovative function.
"Nexus Net" enables students to find
study partners, fellow basketball fans or

even a mutual friend who might introdiu e
users to the cute guv or girl they have been
eyeing during math lecture.
"Club Nexus will create a more con
nected community ... by making it easier
to make friends or to hang out with exist
ing ones." said project mastermind ()rkut
Buyukkokten, a graduate student in com
puter s( ience.
I o register, students must \isit the Web
site, choose a username and password and
enter their profile information. Students
who (lioo.se not to provide information w ill
not be given access to the site's servi( es.

Emphasizing the power of "Nexu>
Net." Ziemann said, "We make it possible
to tangibly connect In allowing member*
to invite ... not onl\ their friends, hut all ol
their 112 riends' 112 riends as well."
Bv limiting membership to Stanford
students, Club Nexus is a secure tool
through which inembei sol the I niversit\
community ma\ (list uss issues, plan event*
and meet new people without feat ol
"shach people" lurking about, said team
member (Caroline (Campbell, a senior s\ m
bolic svstenis major.
Created using the latest and most ad

vaiu ed te< lmolog\ available, (Hub Nexus is
a resource unique to Stanford.
I aking advantage ol the local academic
resources, the portal's creators consulted
even one from grad s( liool "computer ge
niuses. who helped to develop the soft
ware, to ps\ (liolog) professoi s, who assist
ed with profile information.
Other members of t lie Clul> Nexus team
include seniors Matt Burke and lyson
