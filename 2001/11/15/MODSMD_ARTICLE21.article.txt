## With four starters gone, Jacobsen must lead men's hoops 
### AARON LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Let s ho honest, There's no pre
season hype or flowering expecta
tions lor this year's Stanford men's
basketball team.
I here's not even a proven core
ol veterans to lead the wa\.
It must feel like ages since it's
been like this. Four vears, maybe
five?
1 ry two.
"When 1 came in.the team had
lost four starters and the only re
turning starter was Mark Madsen,"
said junior All-American C.ase\ Ja
cobsen, a freshman on the team in
1991). "It's very similar this year in

that I'm the only starter."
Back then, Madsen remained,
but starters Arthur Lee, Kris
Weems, I'im Young and Peter
Sauer had graduated. Now, Jacob
sen returns to a team that lost
starters Michael McDonald, Rvan
Nlendez and both (lollins twins.

So why does it feel longer
than two vears?

Probably because in
1999, Stanford shot out

of the gates <)uic kl\
with a season-opening
victory over Duke and
was the top-ranked
team in the country by
the third week of De
cember.

And according to coach Mike
Montgomery, there were other dif
ferences within the makeup of the

team.
"Mark I Madsen 1 was

such a tremen

dous leader in terms of' u < >rk ethic ;uk 1
passing that along to the otfier kids."
Montgomery said. "I don't know that

we've necessarily uot that. [In

1999] I think wt

had some re
ally good
players w;iit-

ing in the wings that wete ready to go
and wete more fundamentally sound."
Yet, despite Montgomery's
opinion, the parallels between the
two teams are pretty interesting.
In 1999, Stanford was ranked
13th in the Associated Press presea
son poll. I his year, it was again
ranked l'Uh when the poll came
out last week.

In 1999, Stanford had
five freshmen, including a
McDonald's All-American
n Jacobsen, and two senior
starters. 1 his year, it car-

ries four freshmen,

including a Mc-

Donald's All

American in

Josh Chil
dress, and
one senior
starter.
In 19W. thc-

Cai dinal was

picked to fin-

ish third in the

Pacific 10 Confer-

ence. 1 "his year, it's

pic kedeven higher, at sec -
ond.

I herefore, as hard as it

might he to digest, the
numbers, inexperience and

expectations are close to
what tliev were back then.

and, similar to the HH)9 (Cardinal,

this team has the potential to make
a name for itself.
Stanford will have opportunities
early on against perennial powers
Purdue, 1 exas and Michigan Suite,
and then, barring injuries, will have
a legitimate shot to capture a fourth
straight I'ac -10 championship.
It's just a matter of proving it.
"Our goals are absolutely the
same," said Jacobsen, who aver
aged 18.1 points per game last year.
"Just the expectations that other
people have toward us are less. But
that might be a good thing.
"On paper, you can't really ex
pect us to do what we have in the
past, but hopefulh we can use that
as a motivating factor "
Although Jacobsen's ability to
score will be important, his capabil
ity of creating opportunities for his
teammates might be even more
crucial to the Cardinal's success, as
demonstrated b\ his seven-assist
performance on Monday.
And since si/e is at a premium
with the loss of Jason and |arron
Collins, more pressure will be put
upon the shoulders of sophomore
forward Justin Davis and junior
center Curtis Borchardt to stay
healthy. Davis had ankle surgery
over the summer, and Borchardt
missed much of last season before

havingsurgen on his right loot.

"When 1 came in.the team had
lost four starters and the only re
turning starter was Mark Madsen,"
said junior All-American C.ase\ Ja
cobsen, a freshman on the team in
1991). "It's very similar this year in

that I'm the only starter."
Back then, Madsen remained,
but starters Arthur Lee, Kris
Weems, I'im Young and Peter
Sauer had graduated. Now, Jacob
sen returns to a team that lost
starters Michael McDonald, Rvan
Nlendez and both (lollins twins.

So why does it feel longer
than two vears?

Probably because in
1999, Stanford shot out

of the gates <)uic kl\
with a season-opening
victory over Duke and
was the top-ranked
team in the country by
the third week of De
cember.

And according to coach Mike
Montgomery, there were other dif
ferences within the makeup of the

team.
"Mark I Madsen 1 was

such a tremen

dous leader in terms of' u < >rk ethic ;uk 1
passing that along to the otfier kids."
Montgomery said. "I don't know that

we've necessarily uot that. [In

1999] I think wt

had some re
ally good
players w;iit-

ing in the wings that wete ready to go
and wete more fundamentally sound."
Yet, despite Montgomery's
opinion, the parallels between the
two teams are pretty interesting.
In 1999, Stanford was ranked
13th in the Associated Press presea
son poll. I his year, it was again
ranked l'Uh when the poll came
out last week.

In 1999, Stanford had
five freshmen, including a
McDonald's All-American
n Jacobsen, and two senior
starters. 1 his year, it car-

ries four freshmen,

including a Mc-

Donald's All

American in

Josh Chil
dress, and
one senior
starter.
In 19W. thc-

Cai dinal was

picked to fin-

ish third in the

Pacific 10 Confer-

ence. 1 "his year, it's

pic kedeven higher, at sec -
ond.

I herefore, as hard as it

might he to digest, the
numbers, inexperience and

expectations are close to
what tliev were back then.

and, similar to the HH)9 (Cardinal,

this team has the potential to make
a name for itself.
Stanford will have opportunities
early on against perennial powers
Purdue, 1 exas and Michigan Suite,
and then, barring injuries, will have
a legitimate shot to capture a fourth
straight I'ac -10 championship.
It's just a matter of proving it.
"Our goals are absolutely the
same," said Jacobsen, who aver
aged 18.1 points per game last year.
"Just the expectations that other
people have toward us are less. But
that might be a good thing.
"On paper, you can't really ex
pect us to do what we have in the
past, but hopefulh we can use that
as a motivating factor "
Although Jacobsen's ability to
score will be important, his capabil
ity of creating opportunities for his
teammates might be even more
crucial to the Cardinal's success, as
demonstrated b\ his seven-assist
performance on Monday.
And since si/e is at a premium
with the loss of Jason and |arron
Collins, more pressure will be put
upon the shoulders of sophomore
forward Justin Davis and junior
center Curtis Borchardt to stay
healthy. Davis had ankle surgery
over the summer, and Borchardt
missed much of last season before

havingsurgen on his right loot.
