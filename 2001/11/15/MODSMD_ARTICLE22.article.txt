The No. 9 Stanford women's
basketball team has ditched subtle
ty this season.
I heir motto? It's No Secret.
What 's not ;i sec ret are the Car
dinal's intentions for ibis season.
This team is looking for ii .ill — a
successful preseason against top
competition, defending its Pacific
10 Conference championship
and a long run in the NCAA
Tournament.
Stanford is also very candid
about how to go about realizing
these gc >als.
"Being successful is related to
hard work." said head coach 1 ara
VanDerveer.
Hard work is exactly what the
Cardinal is ready to undertake.
After a few tough seasons in which
the program was besieged by in
juries, the Cardinal looks stronger
than ever and has the necessary
components to c apitalize on its skills
and strengths. The team returns 10
players ibis season, including three
starters, in addition to its nationally
recognized 112 reshman class.
I lie media is sharing in the opti
mism, as the team li.is been ranked
in the top 10 for the first time since
the end of the 1997-98 season.
The effectiveness of the Cardi
nal's attack begins with its seniors.

Sophomore Nicole Powell, last

sition this season after pla\ ing point

King's season-ending knee injun
last year. Powell is nationally noted
as ,i player to watch for this season,
and her experience and composure
on the court w ill be critical factors as
Stanford makes its run this season.
Powell, too, has ven definite
goals for the season.
"I want to be better than I was
last year because I want to help the
team," Powell said.
Along with Powell, sophomore

the court in exhibition games and

Trotter will in fact

due to chronic knee

While King i> expected

to pla\ this season, knee problems
will keep her off the courts for at
least two to foili weeks. Fortunate

point guards waiting in the wings.
Freshmen Sebnem kimya

Hungary. Ihe performances of
the freshmen, including forwards

demonstrate the depth this Stan

why this class was tanked No. 112
among recruits.
