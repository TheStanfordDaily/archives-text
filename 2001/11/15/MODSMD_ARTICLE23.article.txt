Anyone who knows anything about NC.AA basket
ball knows that rankings mean nothing in the end —
especial!) preseason rankings.
We've heard time and again about the Cinderella
stories, the teams which overcome tremendous odds
to in.ike a name for themselves, to shock the world.
And we've seen the flip side of this as well, how a
prominent Cardinal team can Ik* ranked No. I in the
nation lot almost an entire season and then be elimi
nated in the 1 lite light of the NCAA Tournament.
Histon tells us that preseason predictions can be
misleading.
"We've never paid too nun h attention to the rank
ings.'" s.iid Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery.
" I he\ re all nonsense and based on speculation."
Cardinal fans w ill hope Montgomery is right this
time, tli.it rankings mean nothing, because Stanford
starts the season at a 'disappointing' No. 13.
The following are a lew teams to watch out for and
a few players to take note of:
First and foremost, there's Duke . . . of course. The

Blue Devils are, according to most polls, the top team
in the nation (see above note about rankings). Despite
the lossofNaisinith Award winner Shane Battier, Duke
boasts arguabh the best starting lineup in the nation.
I he combination of guards |ason Williams and
Chris Duhon will create panic tor any defensive
regime in the country, while the play of Mike Dun
leavv in last year's tournament proved to the world
that lie's not just resting on his family name.
Rutgers transfer forward Dahntay Jones will pro
vide a defensive spark for the team, and center (larlos
800/er has shown vast improvements in recent prac
tices and will establish himself as .1 dominate collegiate
low post player this year.
I he quick guard play of Duke may prove to be an
especial!) difficult matchup up for Stanford guard
I buy Ciovacchini — not that the tandem of Williams
and Duhon won't create matchup problems for ever)
other guard in the country.
Watch out for Mankind too. Ihe I erps have a
power game that can spell trouble lot any team in the
NCAA, as any (Cardinal fan remembers from the maul-
ing Lonm Baxter, lalij llolden

only team singing the bines alter
the recent NBA draft, which
sent the Collins twins packing.
I he lac k ol prominent post

" I lie pro draft has taken them
.ill," said Montgomery. "II vo>'
look at the high school kids
they've taken—anybocl\ who is
big that is talented has heen taken
in the draft early on. It has slowly
hut snreh siphoned the Bill Wal
tons and Kareeins out of the col
legiate game.
( .isc in point: hotli Illinois and
lowa are acknowledged as viable
postseason threats, hut the lllini
and the I lawkeves will have to
prove that their rcspec live big men
can hang with the nation's best.

tional will give the country a
glimpse at what this team is capable
ol compared to other upper tier
teams, as the |avhawks could meet
with both Duke and I ( I.A before
the tournament is over.
