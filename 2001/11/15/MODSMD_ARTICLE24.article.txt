# Women's basketball should be a wide-open affair in 2001-2002

II you thought the 2000 Presidential
Election was unpredictable, wait until you
watch women's basketball this winter.
Going into the new season the national
title race is wide open, ;is a number ol
teams have a realistic chance at the cham
pionship. I nlikeon the men's side, where
Jason Williams' Duke team is easily the
No. 1 team in the nation, the 2001-2002
women's season has no < lear favorite.
"1 think this is a great year in women's
basketball," said No. 9 Stanford head coach
lara VanDerveer. "It looks like it's an
open race and a lot of it will just be people
playing hard, being healtln, playing to
gether. improving their season."
In the preseason rankings, five teams
received at least one first place vote. Con

necticut is ranked first, but it's only 70
points above No. 2 1 ennessee. Vanderbilt,
Oklahoma and Duke round out the top
five. After graduating Player of the Year
Ruth Riley, defending champion Notre
Dame is ranked 15th and is not even fa
vored to win the Pig East.
While the Southeastern Conference is
once again taking its place near the top of
the college basketball world, the Big 12 is
this year's strongest conference. It has
three teams in the preseason top 10 and
the race for the conference title will likely
come down to the wire as No. 1 Okla
homa, No. 7 Texas lech and No. S lowa
State battle for the top spot. Oklahoma's
preseason All-American senior Stace\
Dales is the returning Big 12 Player of the
Year and is the preseason favorite to win
the award again.
Despite the Big 12's ascension, the

SEC remains int redibly strong on top as
the No. 3 Commodores will try to break
Tennessee's streak ol lour straight con
ference titles. Vanderbilt is led by pre
season All-American Chantelle Ander
son, a favorite for national IMayer of the
Year. Ihe Commodores had lost 14
straight games to the Lady Volunteers
before upsetting them in last year's con
ference semifinals.
No. lit Florida also looks like it will be a
presence in the conference race behind
the strong play of returning three-point
threat Brandi McCain.
Defending Big I en Champion and na
tional runner-up Purdue graduated star
Katie Douglas, but the No. 11 Boilermak
ers still look to be a force in t lie national title
picture. The Big leu will probably be a
conference in flux as No. 17 Michigan and
Wisconsin hope to break out this season.

l op-rated Connecticut, which fell to
conference rival Notre Dame in last
Match's NCAA semifinals, is the heavy fa
vorite to regain the Big East title this sea
son. All-American point guard Sue Bird
leads the Huskies while Notre Dame,
Boston (College and Rutgers seem likely to
battle for second place.
No. 9 Stanford is the heavy favorite in
the Pacific-10 conference. Led by a well
balanced attack, the Cardinal has a realis
tic shot at the national championship.
No. 19 Washington and No. 22 Arizona
State look like teams on the rise in the con
ference as they try to challenge Stanford
for the Pac-10 title. Last season, Washing
ton was able to improve from an 8-22
record in 2000 to a Final Eight appear
ance. I his year, they hope to keep up their
success despite graduating two-time lead
ing scorer Megan I"ran/a.

Arizona and Southern California are
also in the hunt fora bid in the NCAA.
Tournament. In addition, the Pac-10 will
have a conference tournament at the end
of the year in Eugene, ()re. This is the first
time that the Pac-10 has had a postseason
league tournament.
Not only is this season wide open for
team championships, there is also no dom
inant individual star. Connecticut's Bird
was the leading vote-getter for the presea
son All-American team. However, Ander
son and Dales were close behind as all
three are looking toward a successful sea
son. Duke sophomore Alana Heard and
Letoya Thomas of Mississippi State were
also named to the team.
As an exciting season begins, we can ;ii
least take solace that, when the final bell
sounds in March, there will be clear and
indisputable champion.
