# Stanford comes up Roses in Big Game

### TIM KANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Note: To fur fun? for the 104 th Big
dame, to be held Saturday at Stanford Stadi
um, the Daily is running three historical Big
Game articles this week. This edition recalls the
magical year of 1999, when the Cardinal dis
posed of the Golden Bears 31-13 to clinch the
Vac-10 title and a Rose Bowl berth.
An indelible image of the Stanford
football team filled the sideline under the
cloudy Saturday afternoon sky — that of
stars and reserves, seniors and freshmen,
players and coat lies alike, all raising the
same object towards the heavens.
A rose.
In the 102 nd Big Game, the Cardinal
defeated California 31-13 in front of
80,740 rain-soaked fanatics at Stanford
Stadium, and managed to accomplish

what had eluded their predecessors for
28 years — an outright Pacific 10 Confer
ence championship and a berth in the
Rose Bowl.
"It'sagreat feeling, for our seniors, for
our coaches, for everybody involved with
our program, to have this moment, to
have this opportunity, to be the undis
puted I'ac-lO Champion and Rose Bowl
representative. It feels great," said an un
usually exuberant head coach Tyrone
Willinghain following the victory, sport
ing a grin from ear to ear for the first time
in recent memory.

The turning point it) the game oc
curred at the lieginning ol the Ith quar
ter with the Cardinal up 21-13. From his
own six-yard line, Stanford sophomore
fullback Casey Moore sped through a
gaping hole in the Cal defensive line and
rumbled 94 yards into the end zone to
give the Card some breathing room and
put the game out of reach .it 28-13.
There weren't exactly a lot of sin prises
in this Big Game, as it was common
knowledge that Cal had no offense, Stan
ford had a lot of offense, and Deltha
O'Neal is a pretty damn good football
player. Sure enough, all of these things
were confirmed Saturday — and also,
Stanford's maligned defense turned in an
impressive performance that may keep
the critics off their back fora while, albeit
against a very weak opponent.

Stanford may not get back to Pasadena this year, but two years ago the Cardinal reached
the Rose Bowl in storybook fashion — by beating the hated Golden Bears 31-13.

a 7-0 lead in less than two min

however, O'Neal managed to
make the Stanford kickofl unit
look helpless, running up the
middle, cutting to the outside and
bla/ing down the sideline to tie
the score at 7-7.

I lopefullv the next trip to the
Rose Bowl for the Cardinal won't

Editor's Note: To fur fun? for the 104 th Big
dame, to be held Saturday at Stanford Stadi
um, the Daily is running three historical Big
Game articles this week. This edition recalls the
magical year of 1999, when the Cardinal dis
posed of the Golden Bears 31-13 to clinch the
Vac-10 title and a Rose Bowl berth.
An indelible image of the Stanford
football team filled the sideline under the
cloudy Saturday afternoon sky — that of
stars and reserves, seniors and freshmen,
players and coat lies alike, all raising the
same object towards the heavens.
A rose.
In the 102 nd Big Game, the Cardinal
defeated California 31-13 in front of
80,740 rain-soaked fanatics at Stanford
Stadium, and managed to accomplish

what had eluded their predecessors for
28 years — an outright Pacific 10 Confer
ence championship and a berth in the
Rose Bowl.
"It'sagreat feeling, for our seniors, for
our coaches, for everybody involved with
our program, to have this moment, to
have this opportunity, to be the undis
puted I'ac-lO Champion and Rose Bowl
representative. It feels great," said an un
usually exuberant head coach Tyrone
Willinghain following the victory, sport
ing a grin from ear to ear for the first time
in recent memory.

The turning point it) the game oc
curred at the lieginning ol the Ith quar
ter with the Cardinal up 21-13. From his
own six-yard line, Stanford sophomore
fullback Casey Moore sped through a
gaping hole in the Cal defensive line and
rumbled 94 yards into the end zone to
give the Card some breathing room and
put the game out of reach .it 28-13.
There weren't exactly a lot of sin prises
in this Big Game, as it was common
knowledge that Cal had no offense, Stan
ford had a lot of offense, and Deltha
O'Neal is a pretty damn good football
player. Sure enough, all of these things
were confirmed Saturday — and also,
Stanford's maligned defense turned in an
impressive performance that may keep
the critics off their back fora while, albeit
against a very weak opponent.

Stanford may not get back to Pasadena this year, but two years ago the Cardinal reached
the Rose Bowl in storybook fashion — by beating the hated Golden Bears 31-13.
