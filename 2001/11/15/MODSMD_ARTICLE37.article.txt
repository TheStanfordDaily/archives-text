## Remy Zero's 'golden' new album 
### KIM SAMEK 
Remy Zero is a diamond in the rough among rock bands.
Members Cinjun late (vocals), Shelby late (guitar, key
boards), C.edric LeMovne (bass), Jeffrey Clain (guitar), Cireg
Slay (drummer) and touring member Leslie van Trease (gui
tars, drums) are the purest, most unassuming people I have
ever met. It's hard to describe them or their music without
sounding corny, but it's easy to tell upon seeing them that they

are special people.
Perhaps what is most
striking alxnit the band
members, second only
to the goodness they
exude, is their born
artistry. It's not some
thing you see in rock
often these (lavs. Hie
Tate brothers and
LeMovne grew up in
the South, home
schooled and self
taught. Born into musi
cal families, they had
creative materials sur
rounding them when
they grew up. At age 1 3,
Shelby Tate turned his

room into a recording studio that was used by professional mu
sicians. He is the archetype of artistic genius, filled with cre
ativity and raw intellect yet unable to cope with pretense, to t he
extent that he has opted not to tour for awhile.
Being around Remy Zero, you feel like they're in some
sort of gang; they're each always in tune to what's going on
with each other. They have no agenda other than feeling
intensely and having to speak their thoughts through
song. This is, of course, reflected in their music. On their
San Francisco stop at the Fillmore last Tuesday, Remy Zero
stole the hearts of fans there to see Pete Vorn, whom they
were supporting. Plenty of their own fans were represent
ed as well.
They have earned their fans through word of mouth — not

through the money of major record labels, but rather through
their skill and charm as musicians. Remy Zero has experienced
some bad luck in the past. As their critically acclaimed but wide
ly unheard last album, "Villa Maine," was released and picking
up momentum, GefTen reorganized and they were shifted
onto Interscope. The band was lost in the confusion. Remy
Zero luckily was released from their contract and.aftei a bid
ding war, chose Klektra Records as its new home.
litis tour, following a tour with close friends Praxis, is in

support of their brand new
release " lite Golden Hum."
The album marks a large de
parture for the band, which
in the past has proven itself as
master of the ballad form,
(live Remy Zero's last record
"Villa Elaine" a couple of
spins, and you will immedi
ately see what I mean, C.in
jun late's exquisite vocals
and heart-breakingly sincere
lyrics elegantly capture his
intense emotional landscape.
His voice sparkles, matched
by very few.
They're so good, they've
influenced Radiohead and
have garnered much atten-

lion from fellow musicians such as Billy ( .organ and Courtney
Love. However, don't mention Radiohead to the band, as such
comparisons are a sore sjk>t lot its members. Hie real com
parison to be made is not in similar sound but in genius.
As 1 walked down the street with Cinjun Tate, he
stopped to talk to every lan, giving each his lull attention.
He gave Intermission bis lull attention last Tuesday before
his set at the Fillmore.
Intermission: Where did the title "The Golden
Hum" come from?
Cinjun Tate: Originally, a friend of ours did a painting called
The Colden I him" that was from a I lenry Miller book. It be
came succinct in that vibration of sound is vibration and that

everything that appears to Ix- solid is really not that solid. It's
just things vibrating at a certain rate. All of the major religions
have references to sound: "the word was made flesh," all of
these things are based in sound.
What does this album mean to you?
This album for me is a bookend for "Villa Elaine." It feels
like, for me, something is completed, something is over now.
It's not like a beginning at all, but putting some stuff away.
Villa was more introspective in some ways, and, for me, con
sciously, I was trying to figure out a way to just tell a story, to
actually convey something. Actually trying to speak witli
someone. Thai's why songs like "Perfect Memory" are hard
to sing, because they're very basic. I'm not hiding as much.
I low did vou approach this album differently? Did you feel
a lot of pressure?
I didn't feel pressure in terms of what I wanted to do. It was
just internal pressure. When we first started the record, I
had another record entirely which were all these slow, de
pressing "Perfect Memory's, "Fair"s, "Life in Rain' s. It was
a conscious trying to reach out more. Rather than having
people come to your house, it's like going to their house.
And I wanted to put an end to this world. I wanted it to be
solidified and say goodbye to it.
Your live show has definitely changed and gained more
energy. Will you continue going in that direction?
Yeah. I think so. My mood shifts abruptly. Right now I love
it. The next album's probably going to be more acoustic
based songs. I'm happy with live shows now. I can feed on
such energy. The more that 1 focus on people outside, the
more I meet people, I see people in the audience, the better
it makes me feel.
How does your experience with Elektra compare with that
of your past labels? Are you happy with them?
Completely happy. They didn't even hear the record until it
was Ix'ing mixed. That's huge fora major label. Our friends
who are in big bands aren't allowed to have that luxury. We are
blessed in that sense. Granted they do have a cool history, i.e.

What would make you consider
this album a success?
I alrcadv consider it a success in the
sense that I purposch don't put niv
selt in a situation in whit h I concep
tuali/e tlu' plate the record is in his
torvoreven where I stautl in the big
picture. You're on a trajectory, and
inentallv as soon as vou step outside
and look back and try to quantilv
where ever) tiling fits, vou're outside
ol it already. Once you start doing
that, it's realh easy to start grasping
lor ideals and getting depressed

about things, h,i|>|>v about other things. I lie biggest success
was just doing the record, that was the tiinnest part. Hie songs
are just what you get in the cud. I'hat, and just seeing people's
reaction — if they like it. And if they don't, I like that too.
I saw the video for "Save Me" on remyzero.com. Clan you
tell me about the concept behind it?
The original thing, the backwards section, was based on a film
t ailed "The Kxistentialist" which is from the '50s. It's this man
who's walking around town and everything is filmed back
wards. I le walked backwards all through the town, the theory
being that lie's walking on his own little path. The world
around him is backwards. Originallv, I wasn't supposed to be

walking around. lliere was
going in be an actor. I showed
up .ind ilii'\ were like, 'here's
vour suit.' Ibe tbeorv about
the other hall, which is the
beautiful part, is dial we bad
toreedit it because of the 9-1 1
tragedies (ii was originally
more ol the band plaving).
It's the undoing of these
tragedies. Kverything is being
reversed. (Collapsed things
are being rebuilt.
Why did you choose "Save
Me" as your first single?
"Save Me" was a song like
"Gramarye," where it was
the last day.the last thing. 1
had rewritten it and rewrit
ten it a million times. Iliey
came and said 'Listen, we
have eight hours. You have
to sing the parts, write the

words and 1 have to mix it or it just won't go oil the record.'
At tin- last minute, it was more of a honest song. I just cast
aside everything that was written and went with a guttural
reaction, st reaming what I wanted to scream. It's strong,
but still uncomfortable for me because 1 like to carefullv
choose words.
Why is this lifestyle appropriate to you? How do you still
get what you want from it and go through all of that and
stay sane?
I try to step outside, meditate. I develop walls. Develop the
abilitv to take something in and let it go. It is hard to stav sen

sitive and Iresh and I notice nivsell changing. You do the
things you have to do. but you have to really guard that inno
cent spot, flic iron\ is that you have to guard it. but vou can't
guard it with walls because it just testers. You have to be as
open as possible and feel every thing its much as possible, but
vou have to develop some wav to let certain things go and not
lie affected.
Do you ever have doubts that this will give you want you
want? How do vou overcome them?
Doubts, veah. In certain situations. So much stuff'happens in
such a small amount of time, that in one da\. vou meet more
people, vou talk to more, you have to do so many other
things. I here are moments were I want to keep strong, but
I'm like 'this is stupid." I'd rather be sitting and making
music:. As long as you have the ability to make music, and
even beyond that, if you just have the time to go inside and
look for peace, that's all that's going to give you real fulfill
ment. Ihe rest is just a game. If you think of it like that, it's
like a dream. You can wake up again. In a dream, vou wake
up from <i monster and at the end you're like 'oh. it's just a
dream.' Knowing it was a dream, yoti think you could have
done the greatest stuff. You could have done anything. If
you keep that in mind here, it lets you be a little braver and
operate on your own principles.
Do you want to experiment with other art forms?
()h veah, m\ biggest passion is that I want to make films. I want
to make sh< >rts. Modern parables, with actors or without. Small
shorts that are color coded, and then do music for it. That's my
dream. Music is just what's natural to me.
A lot of people have this idea that music is some sort of con
scious thing vou're trying to do. 1 find for me, the logic always
conies in retrospect. Y< hi can write lines or make music and be
like what am I doing, but so many times it just makes me smile.
It it makes you smile, vou just have to follow that trajectory.
