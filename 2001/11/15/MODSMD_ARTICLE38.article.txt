I'ixiir is at the heart of the movie's mes
sage. kirbv, an ex-IBM employee, was
discovered by the l-arrellvs in .1 bar in
Burlington, as he plodded along on all
lours (owing to sjnuti bifida). The charac
ter was s|)c( ilicalh written lor him. Jason
Alexander, c hubbier than evet. does not

ment 111 tlieii movies — most notable ol
(onrse, Ben Stillei s nuts and bolt coming
in the wax ol his zipper, and Cameron
