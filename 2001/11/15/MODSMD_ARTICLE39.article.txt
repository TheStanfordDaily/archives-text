# Jucifer rocks like a mofo
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Let s create a hypothetical situation. Let's say that you've never
heard of rock duo Jucifer. Let's say that you just happened to pick
tip [miter's new record, "Ihe Lambs LP," off the shelf. What would
you think?
Well, there's the blurred cover photograph of trees, with a masked
woman in a black dress standing in the background. There's the fact that
die band consists only of singer / guitarist (1. Amber Valentine and drum
mer (i. Edgar Livengood. And the first four songs on the album are ac
tually one larger song, "Lambs" broken into four parts.
"Aha!" you might think. "It's a concept album! It's probably all artsy
and weird!" And you would be so. so wrong.
Which isn't to sa\ that the music has no artistry. It's just an artistry of a
different kind: rather than making broad social statements or construct
ing avant-garde sonic experiments. Jucifer rocks like a motherfucker,
That's right. Ihe band only has one guitar and one set ofdrums, but
it makes some of the loudest, heaviest, most pumped up music you will
ever hear, li seems completely illogical,
[l ucifcr r* 1 cven ( l (>vvm IK' l ' impossible, but it's true.
"The Lambs HP" At its most basic. Juc iter's sound consists
Velocette Records (J of Livengood bashing his drums, Valen-
v --—I tine's voice alternating between dreamy
A I etherealness and a banshee wail and
.J above all, the massive wall of sound she
c reates with her guitar. It's simple and gloriously visceral.
At the same time, Jucifer doesn't hesitate to experiment with and com
pletely deviate from this basic formula: at times, Valentine seems deter
mined to see how many different sounds she can force out ot her guitar,
and at others, the band replaces the usual thrashing with a slow, melan
choly piano melody overlaid by an eerie chant. In fact, Jucifer actually
manages to pack more sonic diversit) into a 20 minute record than most
bands do on albums two or three times as long.
So it |ucitei is a band made up ot hardcore t<x kers, what's up with the
whole four-song song thing? Is this a concept album? Well, 1 guess that
there is some kind oflink between all four mini-songs in "Limbs." some
thing about conformity and lambs being led to the slaughter.
Mavbe.
(.enerally, Valentine's singing is hard to make out over the guitai It
operates like an instrument: the sound communicates more than the ac -
tual words. Which is a good thing, since those words don't always make
much sense. For example, "Limbs #1" primarily involves repeating,
"lilac k little girl, got a new black dress," over and over again.
Riiiiiiight.
I ltiinatelv. jiiciter's appeal has nothing to do with words or rational
thought. I can't really tell you what any of the songs on "The Limbs Ll'"
are "about," and I really don't care. Nope. I'm just going to put the disc
back in the player, turn the volume up and relax as Valentine's guitar and
Liven good's drums raise hell.
