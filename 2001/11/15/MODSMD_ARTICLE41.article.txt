You know you're in fora
lecture when the opening song
of a play includes the phrase
"dry cunt." Watching "Vine
gar lorn," in fact, feels as if
you've walked into a Fern
Studies 101 lecture. The play is
set in a provincial town where
accusations of witchcraft start

being lodged at women whoarebefbre-their
time feminists.
Alice, the heroine, is a sexually liberated
woman who wants to be able to travel the
world and enjoy the pleasures of the flesh as
she pleases, but in her Godly times, being

such an independent woman is not an op
tion. Alice's mother, Belt v, is a widowed lone

ly woman frustrated
at the displacement
and alienation given
to older women.
Alice and her
mother liecome the
targets of accusa
tions when their rich
neighbors begin to

believe that they have been cursed. Hie rich
neighbors' home-life is cursed enough on its
own however, as the husband is an impotent
and abusive jerk, while the wife is called a
"lazy slut," although her only goal in life is to
make him happy.

Hie pla\ dors a remarkable good job of
presenting several issues that aflect females,
but it is so issue-lieaw that the play quickly
logins to feel as if its a political rallv. Vinegar
loin tries hard to U' serious; to l>e fiinin; to
include music and dance; and to lx* vaude
ville. In short, it tries too hard to be every
thing.
It uses a style — ommon on high-end I V
dramas — of overlapping storv lines: the
poor woman, her mother and child, the
abused wife and the young romantic. And
like a I V drama, the plav attempts to weave
them together at the end with a trial scene.
Unfortunately, the characters were little
more than cut-outs or place holders for tvpes.
I'he heroine, Alice, is the only i haracter who

approaches a person with any semblance of
motivation, but the conflict does not change
her. Despite these pitfalls, the play is thor
oughly provocative and entertaining. As
pects of the play are experimental, and the
combining of various styles do manage to
produce a cohesive message.
I'he acting of'the largely female cast is rea
son enough to see Vinegar lorn. Juliet
1 annuel is powerful as Alice, and the rest of
the cast is equally superb in portraying its
characters.
Vinegar Tom can be an enjoyable theatre
experience, but as political drama, its goals
overwhelm the story, l he direction and act
ing of the production are praiseworthy, how
ever, .ind make Vinegar lorn a play to see.
