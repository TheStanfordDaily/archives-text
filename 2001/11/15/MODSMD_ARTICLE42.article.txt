# Goldfinger delivers some furious punk
## 
### JUNG LAH 
Goldfinger formed in the early '90s as a ska-pnnk outfit
hailing from LA, quickly earning a well-deserved reputation
as one of the area's most furiously touring punk bands, while
churning out melodic and catch \ songs that gained them
their most well-known hit, 1996VHere In Your Bedroom."
The band has since moved away from the horn-infested
upbeat tunes of their earlier years to a sound that is more
straight-forward in its pop-punkiness, relying heavily on a
mix of metal, hardcore and skale punk, all of which help to
soliÂ«lil\ the group as one of the best live melodic punk acts
around.

The songs themselves mav not stand out as amazing in
their composition or uniqueness (which is not to say that they
are bad), but live shows are really where Cloldfinger feels at
home, and last Friday's performance at the Warfield dearly
demonstrated why (his band shines outside of the studio.
The band opened up with "Anything," a track off of their
self-titled first album, and continued playing a set which
consisted of mostly older fan-favorite material. Lead singer
/ guitarist John Feldmann was sporting a mohawk and was
as energetic as ever, while new and temporary lead guitarist
Brian Arthur from Unloco filled in adequately for the re
cently departed (lharlic Paulson, despite having had only a
month to learn ;ill of the songs. Anvone who has played
"Tonv Hawk's Pro Skater" on Playstation would have rec
ognized the ska-punk anthem "Superman/' and the
band's sped-up renditions of such songs as "Anxiety," "My
Head" and a cover of 1 he (aire's " Just Like Heaven" kept
the crowd datfcing and jumping and sweating into the
frenzv that is a good punk show.
What puts a (>old finger show above and lx*yond a normal
show in terms of entertainment value is the band's dedica
tion to both crowd participation and crowd enjoyment. As
is customary at even slum Goldlinger plavs, they took some
time during the set to let audience members come up on
stage during their performance of "Mable," and in true
punk rock fashion, let the fans revel in their brief song
length rock-star moment. Feldmann himself stage-dived
into the audience, simultaneously crowd-surfing and pass
ing the mic around so anyone not up on stage could also
sing along, loiter, drummer Damn Pfeiffer came onto stage

dressed in drag and took, over lead singer duties In belting
out a rendition of "Survivoi" h\ Destinv's ('.hild, flanked b\
two other bikini-wearing men who pretended to beat his ass
after the song ended.
At the end of "Miles Away," the last song of the set, Pfeif
fer lit his cymbals on 112 ire, which serv ed as an awesome lasting
impression until the tour song encore, which ranged from
the "fuck-you" sing-along punk rock of "Questions" to the
power thrash metal t iff s of the pro-snow boarder anthem
"SMP" (skiers must perish).
Their final song, "99 Red Balloons," had political over
tones due to its lyrical content describing warfare ending in
nuclear armageddon; at the song's conclusion, the band
goose-stepped otl of the stage while playing distorted power
chords, Imperial-marc h-stvle.
I lie show's two disappointments were the felt absence of
seven-year (loldfmger veteran-cra/v-man Charlie Paulson,
and the decision not to pla\ am oftheii songs with the horn
section of co-headliners Keel Big Fish, a team-up the two
bands were fond of during the mid-'9os.
Regardless of these two factors, be sure to check out
(iol< I linger s live record "Foot In Mouth." which is sold onl\
at shows and is independently released (i.e., no record
label). It does a surprisingly excellent job of capturing the
band's live energy and includes such cover-song-gems as
()peration Ivv's "Smiling" and Sisqo's " I bong Song." It also
features two music videos, one of which is .1 pro-vegetarian
acoustic ballad entitled "Free Me" that graphically depicts
slaughterhouse animal mistreatment and can be viewed on
PETA's Web site.
