# New Bush erotic but needs trimming

### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
Kveryone likes a good bush.
Just ask Gwen Stefani of No
Doubt. Her bo\ toy Gavin Ross
dale and the rest of the gang
from Hush have released their
fourth album, "Golden State."
1 he album st;n ts off golden, but
begins to lose its glint within the
first couple of tracks.
Like all three Bush records,
you need to listen to the CM) at
least three or four times in order
to get a make a clear distinction
between the jewels and the turds
of the compilation.

The first song,
"Solutions" is by far
the gold mine of the
album. It is both a
mesmerizing and
soothing tune that
enhances the

raunchiness and depth that
Rossdale is capable of through
his vocals. "Inflatable" was an
other gem. Definitely a make-out
song, Rossdale sings, "It's like
we've come undone/ But I've
only become inflatable for you /1
don't mind most of the time/But
you push me so far inside." Very
erotic, very raw, very Bush.

h. ★★☆☆☆

()ther than "So
lutions" and
"Inflatable," the
album offers
nothing as pow
erful as older
ltush ballads

such as "Glycerine," or "dome
down." With tht- exception of
"The People I hat We Love,"
which has hit the airwaves within
the last month, 1 see no hope for
Bush getting any love from the
alternative rock stations — the
album is too congested with
rage, busy guitar riffs and inces
sant vociferation. 1 can imagine

songs like "Fugitive," "Reasons"
and " The Land of the Living" to
be perfect when speeding down
the highway on your way to
Tahoe, when lifting weights or
when fixing a car in a suburban
neighborhood garage. There is
no distinction between one bel
lowing ballad from the next.
Rossdale explained "Golden
State" as being a very "naked
record." In my opinion, the
songs are too bloated to be seen
naked; the band should redress,
rethink and rework many of
their songs before they disrobe
this bush.
