# Re-Joyce: 'Dead' full of life

### JASON ROSENSWEIG 
As a musical, James Joyce's magnif
icent masterpiece of a short story,
" The Dead," is not a slew of merry
Irish folk songs, sung in a comfortable,
softly lit turn-of-the century living
room.

"James Joyce's The yy
Dead"
Richard Nelson
irkirCrCi

in his 1914 short story collection, Duhliners — is, however, a miracle. Its
lujiiid poetic prose and its sweet, sparkling images swirl together into an
epiphany, list losing image — "the snow falling faintly through the uni
verse and faintlv falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the liv
ing and the dead" — is the beauty that all literature strives for.
I low can one turn such a story into a musical? I his question is more
fascinating than the musical production itself. Joyce's style is so intense
l\ internal, and dramatic productions are so external, that the switch is
certainh challenging if not impossible. But the power of the stage is its
immediacy, its captive audience and its ability to reach people who might
not read Joyce independently.
So Nelson and Davey draw their interpretation — a fine one — of the
stor\ and then respin it into a play. The story line is much the same:
(iabriel, the stooped and occasional!) faltering, yet eloquent, narrator, is

at his family's annual Christmas party. Bustle and merriment carry the
party into the night, and Gabriel returns to his hotel room with his wife,
Gretta. She tells him of a young lover of hers who died, having caught
an illness pining for her on a cold rainy night. Gabriel then has an
epiphany.
But in the musical, much of the time on stage is taken up with the
guests singing 112 olk and party songs as part of their annual ritual. The
tlavor of the songs fits well with the russet and brown costumes, and
there is indeed an Irish family gathering on stage. There is no orches
tra, only a few stage musicians and some recorded accompaniment, so
musical numbers are nicely understated, onh once breaking into a full
company grand dance.
112 lie songs are beautifully integrated into the story. leaving onh a
handful of songs in the typical musical style, where a i harai ter's emo
tion wells up into an outbreak of song — including, unfortunately, the
ending of the story, which (iabriel sings before it becomes a jarring en
semble piece.
Nelson and Davey wisely choose to set the pla\ in one act, so th.it the
arc of the story can slide smoothly into the delicate gentleness of the end
ing — which, for its part.-is retained. (iretta lies on the hotel bed, qui
etly sobbing in the moonlight. (iabriel sits, decisively, off to the side/his
pain and anguish flowing out in gentle song. If" I he Dead" is any indi
cation. Joyce does indeed have a place on the stage.


Honey, why won't you pull my finger?
