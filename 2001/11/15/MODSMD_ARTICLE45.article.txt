# Falstaff an opera buffa
## 
### BENJAMIN LAWRANCE 
After the superb "Samson and Dalila" ear
lier this season, San Francisco Opera's revival
of the 1985 Jean-Pierre Ponnelle pnxluction
of Verdi's "Falstaff" restaged by Vera Lucia
(lalabria is quite an achievement.

Verdi's last great work, an opera buffa, is
a difficult project for any orchestra and cast
because of the delicacy of its comic timing as
well as the insuperable centrality of the lead
ing role. Legend has it that Verdi, aided by
the unflinching devotion ol his librettist Arri
go Boito, was driven to create "Falstaff" be
cause of a snide comment bv Rossini to the ef
fect that he was incapable of writing comedy.
With this opera, not only did Verdi silence
his critics, but he raised the standards for mu
sical comedy to daunting new heights.
The knight Sir John Falsi.iff had long
been one of Verdi's favorite characters.
Though it blurs many of the textual details,
Boito's libretto is one of the most brilliant op
eratic renditions of Shakespeare, easily
eclipsing the only other attempt of note, that
of Ralph Vaughan Williams, entitled "Sir
John in Love." Condensing "The Merry
Wives of Windsor" and incorporating as
pects of "Henry IV" Parts One and Two,
Verdi's opera captures through music of un
surpassed delicacy, the dynamism and wit of
Shakespearean comedy, and in particular
the prodigious personality of Shakespeare's
corpulent anti-hero. Those less familiar with

Shakespeare's "Henry IV" trilogy' might re
call C ins van Sant's free adaptation of the
princely role for the film "My Own Private
Idaho" (1991).
The plot is not difficult, but it is full of the
usual mistaken identities, intrigue and
bawdiness. Sir John Falstaff (played by
|ohn Del Carlo), a general cretin and thief,
plans to seduce two wealthy matrons Alice
Ford (Nancy Gustafson) and Meg Page
(Victoria L.ivengood). In their home, Meg,
Alice and Nannetta (Anna Netrebko) real
ize that Falstaff has false designs and re
solve to punish him. While preparing for
the arrival of the rotund knight, the women
assure Nannetta that she will never be be
trothed to ugly old ('aius.
Falstaff begins his seduction but is sud
denly interrupted by the arrival of Mister
Ford with an angry mob. Falstaff hides in a
linen basket and the scene concludes with
the dumping of the basket's contents into
the river.
Act Three finds Alice using the terrifying
legend of the Black kuight to lure Falstaff
into the Windsor Great Park to continue his
punishment. In the moonlit forest the mas-

queraders seduce and taunt Falstafl into re
pentance. Nannetta s maternal guardians
also take the opportunity to arrange her be
trothal to her beloved Fenton (Paul
droves). Thus Falstafl, Ford and Caius are
punished for their corruption and chauvin
ism. 1 he scene concludes with Falstaff lead
ing the company in declaring "the world is
but a jest."
SFO's production was lively and thor
oughlv enjoyable. Del (larlo was a dynamic
Falstafl. Fhough a touch weak on the upper
notes, he almost filled the enormous shoes
bequeathed him In Thomas Stewart. Mis
tresses Quickly, Page and Ford were a re
markable ensemble, and Dwayne Clroft's "F
sogno? () realta?" was magical. The high
light. however, was the stunning Anna Ne
trebko. Her companion, Groves, liever
overshadowed her and still has room to
grow. But who could fault her glistening, sil
very tremolo? Her aria, "Sul fil d un sotlio
etesio," was a richly woven tapestry of deli
cate control and poise. Runnicies conducted
with his characteristic brio. This production
should not be missed.
