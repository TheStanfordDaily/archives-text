### ROXY SASS 
I )ear Staiifbrdians -
I'm sure you're all busy with
midterms, hut that's no excuse to ig
nore dear old Roxy. I haven't
heard from any of you in the last
couple ol weeks, so I'm sorry to sa\
I don't have a naughtv question to
answer. But I've decided not to let
that stop me. Instead I II deal with
something near and dear to tin
heart — deflowering the masses.
List June, the Daily ran an arti
< le called "Sex on the Farm" which
detailed the results of a poll taken in
While Plaza. I he results of this poll
were not. in my seasoned eves, ex
actl\ stellar. I he situation seems to
he that some *40 penent ofvou have
nevei participated in the Slap-and-
I'ickle (Goodwill ('allies. 1 )isc<null
ing the major religious fortes at
work on campus and the <xxasional
(x (urrenceof unfortunate genet its,
.1 healthv 20 percent of vou are vir
ginal hy circumstance, not h\
choice. I think it's time th.it situa
tion was remedied, so here's your
guide to first times.
I here are tw< > s< h* x >ls of t Ik night
on this subject. I lie first, the "(let It
Ovei With" contingent, was made
popular In Freud and advocated In
fiat ho\s the world ovei I his is the
idea that the first time doesn't mat
in . and \oiii partner for this possi

hlv formative experience also
doesn't mallet. What mallei s is that
it's ovei so that when \oii meet
someone \oti could see dating, \ou
don't have to worn about telling
him or her vou're a virgin.
I lie other option is what I call
the Godot school. I liese are the
people who.ire waiting l<>r the light
person. Manv of the earlier nien
tioned unfortunate genetic combi
nations will ding to ibis idea. And
then there are some who actually
are waiting, litis is .t loveh idea.
(itxxl luck with it.
But the important question is.
whi( It st boot is right? Neither. (let
ting it over with is not a healthv ap
proach. And as an\ Beckett fan
knows, waiting for Godot is point
less. I here is no right person. What
there is. however, is the right kind
of person. You need someone vou
feel comfortable with. Alter surviv
ing the woes of puberty, vou may
not be terribly at ease being naked
with someone you don't know. I'm
no a<lv<xate ol waiting for an en
gagement ring, but consider vour
comfort level before vou decide to
do the deed. ()nce vou've found the
light person, proceed cautiouslv.
Here are some tips to make your
first time as painless (physicallv and
psychologically) as possible.
(iirls — the Ik-si thing you can do
to make this a non-regrettable expe
riein e is lobe in totu h with vourself.

Fhvsically. If you know what turns
vou on, you can help him. This is a
hands-on. full-contact, team sport.
You are an integral part of the ac
tion. You are not going for an im
pression of driftwood. Don't just lie
there. You may not be comfortable
enough to take charge and ride him
likea recalcitrant donkev,but gel in
volved. lift your pelvis. Bend your
knees. Touch him. Guys have

roughly the same erogenous zones,
take advantage of them.
Keep in mind it's not going to be
the best sex of your life. It's differ
ent for everybody — some girls
have a bit of pain, others experi
ence mild discomfort, and a lucky
lew feel absolutely nothing the first
time. Whatever it is for you is nor
mal. Arguably the most important
thing to remember is RFLAX. If

\ou can't relax, vou're not going to
enjoy yourself. And if vou're not
going to enjox vourself, there's no
reason to do it.
Guvs — Because you don't have
to worry about pain or bleeding,
I'm going to fixais on what you can
do for your partner. If it's your first
time, things can be over rather
quicklv. I iiless vou're 30, it's noth
ing to worrv about. If vou want your
girl's defl< >w ering to be a positive ex
perience, the l>est thing you can do
is to prepare her for actual sex. I bis
is not .ucomplished In liberal appli
cation of water-based lube.
For most women to get the most
out of sex, the actual act of inter
course should follow a significant
amount of fbreplay, which, if done
correctly, will result in enough nat
ural lube. If you manage to get her
to orgasm before the actual sex be
gins, you will have accomplished
two important feats — she will lx
lubricated, and she will be relaxed.
She will be putty in your hands.
So get out there, boys and girls.
Let's get those statistics under con
trol. It's all fine and good to have a
certain percentage of virgins at our
school, but we want numbers like
UCSB's, not Gal Tech!

I )ear Staiifbrdians -
I'm sure you're all busy with
midterms, hut that's no excuse to ig
nore dear old Roxy. I haven't
heard from any of you in the last
couple ol weeks, so I'm sorry to sa\
I don't have a naughtv question to
answer. But I've decided not to let
that stop me. Instead I II deal with
something near and dear to tin
heart — deflowering the masses.
List June, the Daily ran an arti
< le called "Sex on the Farm" which
detailed the results of a poll taken in
While Plaza. I he results of this poll
were not. in my seasoned eves, ex
actl\ stellar. I he situation seems to
he that some *40 penent ofvou have
nevei participated in the Slap-and-
I'ickle (Goodwill ('allies. 1 )isc<null
ing the major religious fortes at
work on campus and the <xxasional
(x (urrenceof unfortunate genet its,
.1 healthv 20 percent of vou are vir
ginal hy circumstance, not h\
choice. I think it's time th.it situa
tion was remedied, so here's your
guide to first times.
I here are tw< > s< h* x >ls of t Ik night
on this subject. I lie first, the "(let It
Ovei With" contingent, was made
popular In Freud and advocated In
fiat ho\s the world ovei I his is the
idea that the first time doesn't mat
in . and \oiii partner for this possi

hlv formative experience also
doesn't mallet. What mallei s is that
it's ovei so that when \oii meet
someone \oti could see dating, \ou
don't have to worn about telling
him or her vou're a virgin.
I lie other option is what I call
the Godot school. I liese are the
people who.ire waiting l<>r the light
person. Manv of the earlier nien
tioned unfortunate genetic combi
nations will ding to ibis idea. And
then there are some who actually
are waiting, litis is .t loveh idea.
(itxxl luck with it.
But the important question is.
whi( It st boot is right? Neither. (let
ting it over with is not a healthv ap
proach. And as an\ Beckett fan
knows, waiting for Godot is point
less. I here is no right person. What
there is. however, is the right kind
of person. You need someone vou
feel comfortable with. Alter surviv
ing the woes of puberty, vou may
not be terribly at ease being naked
with someone you don't know. I'm
no a<lv<xate ol waiting for an en
gagement ring, but consider vour
comfort level before vou decide to
do the deed. ()nce vou've found the
light person, proceed cautiouslv.
Here are some tips to make your
first time as painless (physicallv and
psychologically) as possible.
(iirls — the Ik-si thing you can do
to make this a non-regrettable expe
riein e is lobe in totu h with vourself.

Fhvsically. If you know what turns
vou on, you can help him. This is a
hands-on. full-contact, team sport.
You are an integral part of the ac
tion. You are not going for an im
pression of driftwood. Don't just lie
there. You may not be comfortable
enough to take charge and ride him
