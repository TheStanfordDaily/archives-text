KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) —
1 he rout of the Taliban at ( derat
ed yesterday with the Islamic mili
ti.i losing control of Jalalabad in
the east, once-loyal Pashtun
tribesmen joining in the revolt in
the south and many of their light
ers fleeing into the mountains to
evade U.S. air'strikes.
I he Taliban is "in retreat virtu
ally all over the country," Vice
President Dick Cheney said in
Washington.
A clay after seizing the capital,
Kabul, elements ol the northern al
liance consolidated their power by
taking over the defense and interior
ministries — temporary measures,
the alliance insisted, until a I '.N.-su
pervised political settlement repre
senting all ethnic groups.
In the south, there were re
ports — although impossible to
confirm — of fighting in the
streets of Kandahar, the Tal
iban's birthplace.
Many of Afghanistan's 2.'< or
more I'ashtun groups appeared to
have risen up against tlu- Taliban,
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adtn.
John Stnfflebeem said. "Whether
or not they're working in concert,
we don't know,"he told reporters
in Washington.
I he tribal leaders were Pashtuns
— members of Afghanistan's
largest ethnic group, which served
as the backbone of the Taliban's
harsh five-year regime.
"It is time for the rest of

Afghanistan — particularly the
ethnic groups in the south — to
join the uprising against the Tal
iban and throw oil their oppres
sive rule," British Prime Minister
Ton) Blair said in London. " The
sooner they act, the greater the
benefit for all the people of
Afghanistan."
Cheney said the Taliban's re
t real was"a very good beginning
to what's likely to be a long strug
gle" which will end only with the
c-aptlire of ()sama bin I .aden and
the destruction of his al-Qaida
terrorist network.
President Bush launched
airstrikes against Afghanistan
on Oct. 7 after the Taliban re
fused to surrender bin Laden,
sought in the Sept. 1 I terrorist
attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.
Taliban officials insisted the Is
lamic movement remained intact in
its southern strongholds despite its
losses. A I alihan official, Mullah
Abdullah, told the Afghan Islamic
Press the movement's supreme
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar
and his "guest," bin I .aden, were
"safe and well."
A U.S. official in Washington —
speaking on condition of anonymi
ty — said there was lighting in the
streets of Kandahar between Pash
tun tribesmen and the Taliban. The
official asserted that the c ity would
fall to anti-Taliban forces within
days if not hours.
