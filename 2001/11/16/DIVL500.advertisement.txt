Pear Members and Friends of the Stanford and Berkeley Communities:
On November 17, 2001, Stanford and Cal will square off in the
104 th annual Big Game at Stanford Stadium, an event that has
become a Bay Area tradition. Our two universities share a strong
football and academic heritage as well as a spirited and storied
rivalry.
This year has proven to be a trying one for our campus communi
ties, the Bay Area, and the nation. It is all the more fitting, then,
that the traditional goal of the Big Game be reinforced this year: a
spirited competition on the field and an enjoyable experience for
those in the stands.
Unfortunately, in past years the spirit of Big Game has been damp
ened by the irresponsible behavior of some that resulted in fracas
and property damage.
Given the current climate caused by the tragic terrorist acts our
nation recently experienced, we ask this year that you retrain from
engaging in pranks or other activities that may draw law enforce
ment and security personnel and resources away from responding
to more pressing matters.
We feel that those attending the Big Game should not have to fear
for their safety; therefore, we must emphasize that fans who engage
in incidents of field trespass, physical assault and/or property dam
age will be ejected from the stadium. Students found responsible
tor these types of activities will face disciplinary action at their
respective institutions; such action may include suspension or dis
missal. Please respect more than a century of Big Game tradition
and celebrate your school spirit, pride and sportsmanship in a safe,
positive and friendly manner. Enjoy the game!
Sincerely,
John L. Hennessy
