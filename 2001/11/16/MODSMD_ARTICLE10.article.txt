# Daily online survey reveals surprising degree of respect & appreciation for school across the Bay
## Friends or Foes? 
### CHARLES FENG KEVIN SIMLER 
T.ditoi \ Sate: In preparation for tomorrow's l()~flli liig
Game, The Daily ran a two-week online survey inviting a
wide range oj Stanford community members — undergrad
uates, graduates and alumni — to weigh in about C.aland
the historic cross-Bay rivahy. This story presents the results of
the smi'ey, which was written and developed by sophomores
/•'eng., of Stanford, and Simler, of I '( '.-Berkeley.
I lie friendh competition between Stanford and
I C.-Berkcle\ lias produced one ol the longest and
most colorful ol collegiate rivalries. Wit 11 a history rich
in lore, its annual c ulmination in the Big Game deter
mines Ba\ Area bragging rights lor the remainder of
the year.
With sui h .1 storied tradition behind them, ii is not
surprising that students .it Cal and Stanford — or
perhaps more affectionately, kal and Stanfurd —
have been taunting, playing trie ks and causing good
natured mayhem toward their across-the-Bay coun
terparts tor more than a century.
Evaluating the stereotypes
I lie rivalrv. of course, tomes packaged with cer
tain assumptions made l>\ both sides. At Stanford, the

prevailing opinion is that ( .il students are <|ii itt* liber
al .ind a bit less academicalh inclined.
And the city ot Berkeley doesn't do much to re
deem its students in the eyes ot Stanford. With an
ample supply of seech characters, Berkeley is not the
most conventional place for intellectual stimulation.
lb determine whether these stereotypes accurate
ly reflect the views of Stanford students, The Daily
prepared (he online surve\. which a total ol MO Stan
lord people, representing a si/eable sample of both
current students and alumni, took.
In addition, 'WO responses came from loyal — but
pernicious — ('.a I students, who in true Big Game ri
valry fashion "crashed" the surve\ in an attempt to
tamper with the results.
('.onsequentlv, numerous survey entries peppered
with comments like "Stanford sucks" and "(io Bears"
and renditions of the C.al fight song had to be re
moved from the final data set.
Respect for the enemy
In the eyes of many, Stanford is one of the premier
private universities in the nation, while Cal is among
the top public universities in the country. While it is to


NEMIL DALAL/The Stanford Daily
be expected that Stanford affiliates
would ac knowledge Cal as an aca
demic counterpart, a surprising 93
percent said they had respect for
Cal as an academic institution.
Moreover, (>() percent of Stan
ford students said they thought
they would be happy attending Gal.
But the difficulty of UC-
Berkeley is not lost upon the
Stanford populace — 72 percent
said they feel that Gal's workload
is as hard or harder than that of
Stanford.
And the survey seems to dis
prove the popular retrain that Gal
is a safety school for Stanford re
jects— one-third of the respon
dents who applied to Cal said they
were not admitted.
Contrasting environments
Cal's political ideologies were
made famous during the '60s and
'70s, when Berkeley was a hotspot
for left-leaning social awareness,
imbued with a heavy dose of hip
pie culture.
It seems that this opinion lives
on, as nearly four-in-ftve respon
dents said they feel that Gal stu
dents are more liberal, though
only 28 percent would go so tar as
to say that Cal students are "a
bunch of radical protesters."
Three-in-five polled felt the Cal
populace was "more in tune with

the real world." Some praised Cal
students for their activism.
"I don't necessarily agree with all
the things they do, but somebody
needs to bring these issues to atten
tion," said Stanford sophomore
Rav Chen.
lucked serenely beneath the
Santa ('.lara Foothills, the notorious
"Stanford Bubble" contrasts
sharply with urban Berkeley,where
bustling streets are lined with a wide
selection of shops and restaurants.
With the campus's eight-story high
rise dormitories, on a clear day one
can see the Golden Gate Bridge.
74 percent of respondents
said they like the fact that Cal is
integrated into the city, though
nearly two-in-five still deem it"a
dirty place."
"I've been there a couple of
times, and I wouldn't like the qual
ity of life there," said junior Rustin
McCullum.
Occupying Golden Bear terri
tory is a student body composed
of more than 31,000 students, 70
percent of whom are Asian or
Caucasian. Nevertheless, 86 per
cent of those polled felt that Cal
was diverse.
A fun tradition gone too far?
The rivalry has had its share of
amusing moments on both sides.
In addition to the excitement of the
game itself , the rivalry's symbol, the
Axe, has been a constant source of
enjoyment over the years.
In all. 86 percent of respon
dents agreed that the rivalry is an

enjoyable addition to their college
experience.
But the rivalry extends far be
yond the Big Game and infects
other aspects of the interaction be
tween Stanford and Cal. Each
sport seems to have its own version
of the showdown. For swimming,
it's the Big Swim. For track and
field, the Big Meet.
Though the rivalry has many
positive attributes, a si/cable
number of Stanford students said
they feel it is often pushed too far.
Thirty-six percent thought that
Cal students took the rivalry too
seriously, and 28 percent said
they think Stanford students go
overboard.
"I enjoy the fun part of the ri
valry," said one respondent. "But I
hate at the game how our student
section acts like we're better. I es
pecially hate the 'You will work for
us' [chant] because they are at the
same academic level as us."
()ne-in-five respondents
claimed to have a hatred for Cal,
which comes as no surprise to stu
dents like (>al sophomore 1 loward
Ching, who ac tually found the fig
ure somewhat low.
"Definitely more than 20 per
cent of Cal students bate Stan
ford," be said. "I've been to Stan
ford a few times and it didn't seem
like they really hate Cal all that
much."
Hatred on the part of Stanford
students was found more often in
those who were rejected from Cal,
but less often in those with friends

and family there.
I his rang true with Cal fresh
man Claire Wine-man, whose
brother is a senior at Stanford. Ac -
cording to Winemau, having .i sib
ling across the B.iv "kind of tones
down the rivalry."
However, Wineman was quick
to point out where her loyalties
lie. "Cal is better of course," she
declared.
"Tempered by time and
distance"
The rivalry also seems to be
tempered by time .mcl distance, as
data gathered on alumni shows.
Alumni report bating Cal half as
often as students, said they enjoy
the rivalry more and in general
had better things to say about their
Cal counterparts than did i in rent
Stanford students.
Despite their misgivings, both
alumni and students gave mostly
positive remarks about ('.aland the
rivalry.
1 he comments section of the
survey contained the occasional
"Cal sucks," but the prevailing atti
tude was tolerant and respectful.
When Cal comes marching in
for the Big (iame tomorrow, it will
be the continuation of a long and
hallowed tradition.
And who knows what Cal stu
dents will be thinking of their
Stanford counterparts as they
stroll down Palm Drive. Aftei all,
aren't Stanford students just a
bunch of elitists, isolated from the
rest of the world?

Respect for the enemy
In the eyes of many, Stanford is one of the premier
private universities in the nation, while Cal is among
the top public universities in the country. While it is to

be expected that Stanford affiliates
would ac knowledge Cal as an aca
demic counterpart, a surprising 93
percent said they had respect for
Cal as an academic institution.
Moreover, (>() percent of Stan
ford students said they thought
they would be happy attending Gal.
But the difficulty of UC-
Berkeley is not lost upon the
Stanford populace — 72 percent
said they feel that Gal's workload
is as hard or harder than that of
Stanford.
And the survey seems to dis
prove the popular retrain that Gal
is a safety school for Stanford re
jects— one-third of the respon
dents who applied to Cal said they
were not admitted.
Contrasting environments
Cal's political ideologies were
made famous during the '60s and
'70s, when Berkeley was a hotspot
for left-leaning social awareness,
imbued with a heavy dose of hip
pie culture.
It seems that this opinion lives
on, as nearly four-in-ftve respon
dents said they feel that Gal stu
dents are more liberal, though
only 28 percent would go so tar as
to say that Cal students are "a
bunch of radical protesters."
Three-in-five polled felt the Cal
populace was "more in tune with

the real world." Some praised Cal
students for their activism.
"I don't necessarily agree with all
the things they do, but somebody
needs to bring these issues to atten

Rav Chen.

With the campus's eight-story high

74 percent of respondents
said they like the fact that Cal is
integrated into the city, though
nearly two-in-five still deem it"a
dirty place."
"I've been there a couple of
times, and I wouldn't like the qual

McCullum.
Occupying Golden Bear terri
tory is a student body composed
of more than 31,000 students, 70
percent of whom are Asian or
Caucasian. Nevertheless, 86 per

was diverse.
A fun tradition gone too far?
The rivalry has had its share of
amusing moments on both sides.
In addition to the excitement of the
game itself , the rivalry's symbol, the
Axe, has been a constant source of
enjoyment over the years.
In all. 86 percent of respon
dents agreed that the rivalry is an

enjoyable addition to their college
experience.
But the rivalry extends far be
yond the Big Game and infects
other aspects of the interaction be
tween Stanford and Cal. Each
sport seems to have its own version
of the showdown. For swimming,
it's the Big Swim. For track and
field, the Big Meet.
Though the rivalry has many
positive attributes, a si/cable
number of Stanford students said
they feel it is often pushed too far.
Thirty-six percent thought that
Cal students took the rivalry too
seriously, and 28 percent said
they think Stanford students go
overboard.
"I enjoy the fun part of the ri
valry," said one respondent. "But I
hate at the game how our student
section acts like we're better. I es
pecially hate the 'You will work for
us' [chant] because they are at the
same academic level as us."
()ne-in-five respondents
claimed to have a hatred for Cal,
which comes as no surprise to stu
dents like (>al sophomore 1 loward
Ching, who ac tually found the fig
ure somewhat low.
"Definitely more than 20 per
cent of Cal students bate Stan
ford," be said. "I've been to Stan
ford a few times and it didn't seem
like they really hate Cal all that
much."
Hatred on the part of Stanford
students was found more often in
those who were rejected from Cal,
but less often in those with friends

and family there.

However, Wineman was quick
to point out where her loyalties
lie. "Cal is better of course," she
declared.
"Tempered by time and
distance"
The rivalry also seems to be
tempered by time .mcl distance, as
data gathered on alumni shows.
Alumni report bating Cal half as
often as students, said they enjoy
the rivalry more and in general
had better things to say about their
Cal counterparts than did i in rent
Stanford students.
Despite their misgivings, both
alumni and students gave mostly
positive remarks about ('.aland the
rivalry.
1 he comments section of the
survey contained the occasional
"Cal sucks," but the prevailing atti

When Cal comes marching in
for the Big (iame tomorrow, it will
be the continuation of a long and
hallowed tradition.
And who knows what Cal stu
