### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A sharply divided community partici
pated in an open forum last night to dis
cuss the alignments of two trails that
Stanford is required to dedicate for pub
lic use under the General Use Permit it
agreed to with Santa Clara County.
A packed audience in I'residder's
Oak Room Lounge heard presentations
by the County Planning Office and Utii
versitv officials, after which the floor was
opened for more than two hours of
input from the community and environ
mental groups.
In what I director of Government and
Community Relations Larry Morton
called "a very respectful and thoughtful
hearing," approximately 20 members of
the community spoke out against the
University's proposals while about 15 ex

pressed their support.
1 he open forum, arranged by the
county to inform and solicit input I'rom
the public, conies amidst an intense hat
tie between the University and local envi
ronmental groups 011 the placements of
two trails through the Foothills.
While the countv's 1 rails Master Plan
and the GUP outline the locations of the
two routes, they do not stipulate the
exact alignments of the trails, according
to University officials. I he debate last
night and in recent weeks has centered
on exactly where the trails should be
placed.
Stanford has proposed two align
ments of the (.1 trail (San Francisqui
to / Los Francos ('.reeks Connector
Irail) and SI trail (Matadero
Creek/Page Mill Sub-regional frail)
that it says meet the GUP requirements.
"Our primary concern was to main

poses," said Charles Carter, assistant di

relations. "(Our proposals! meet the
General Use Permit and serve the Uni
versity's needs in the long run."
Many communit\ members, howev
er, steadfast I) disagreed with this claim
last night and proposed alternative
routes.
" I here will not be another opportuni
ty to create new alignments," said Denice
Dade of the Committee for Green
Foothills. According to Dade, Stanford's
proposal is deficient for three main rea
sons: environmental insensilivity, inade
quate safety and a lack of connectivity
with other trails.
In recent weeks, a coalition of envi
ronmental groups has stood behind a po-
