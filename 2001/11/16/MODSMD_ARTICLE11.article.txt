# Forum reveals division on trails
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A sharply divided community partici
pated in an open forum last night to dis
cuss the alignments of two trails that
Stanford is required to dedicate for pub
lic use under the General Use Permit it
agreed to with Santa Clara County.
A packed audience in I'residder's
Oak Room Lounge heard presentations
by the County Planning Office and Utii
versitv officials, after which the floor was
opened for more than two hours of
input from the community and environ
mental groups.
In what I director of Government and
Community Relations Larry Morton
called "a very respectful and thoughtful
hearing," approximately 20 members of
the community spoke out against the
University's proposals while about 15 ex

pressed their support.
1 he open forum, arranged by the
county to inform and solicit input I'rom
the public, conies amidst an intense hat
tie between the University and local envi
ronmental groups 011 the placements of
two trails through the Foothills.
While the countv's 1 rails Master Plan
and the GUP outline the locations of the
two routes, they do not stipulate the
exact alignments of the trails, according
to University officials. I he debate last
night and in recent weeks has centered
on exactly where the trails should be
placed.
Stanford has proposed two align
ments of the (.1 trail (San Francisqui
to / Los Francos ('.reeks Connector
Irail) and SI trail (Matadero
Creek/Page Mill Sub-regional frail)
that it says meet the GUP requirements.
"Our primary concern was to main

tain I niversit) lands for I niversity pur
poses," said Charles Carter, assistant di
rer! or of government and communit\
relations. "(Our proposals! meet the
General Use Permit and serve the Uni
versity's needs in the long run."
Many communit\ members, howev
er, steadfast I) disagreed with this claim
last night and proposed alternative
routes.
" I here will not be another opportuni
ty to create new alignments," said Denice
Dade of the Committee for Green
Foothills. According to Dade, Stanford's
proposal is deficient for three main rea
sons: environmental insensilivity, inade
quate safety and a lack of connectivity
with other trails.
In recent weeks, a coalition of envi
ronmental groups has stood behind a po-

sition paper that denies the validi
ty of Stanford's trail alignments.
I'he groups include the Commit
tee tor (ireen Foothills, the Stan
lord Open Spate Alliance, the
Sierra Club, At terra, the Mid
Peninsula Regional Open Space
District and Mid-Peninsula Action
lot Tomorrow.
1 he paper contends that the CI
trail along Alpine Road at the
northwestern part of campus is
partly outside of Santa Clara
County and on private lands out
side of campus, a fact they claim
runs contrary to the agreement.
" These trails were meant to
mitigate the impact of five million
square feet of developments
which Stanford has been allowed
to build," said Peter Drekmeier of
the Stanford Open Space Al
liance. Drekmeier saitl that ac
cording to the GUP, the trails
should be on Stanford lands with
in Santa ( lara county.
The University disagrees. "It's
true that some of it is not on Stan
lord land, and it's (rue that a large
part ol it is not in Santa (-lara coun
ty," Provost John Ktchemendy
said of the CI trail. "What's not

true is that this runs contrary to
the General Use Permit."
I'he public forum also wit
nessed much dispute about the SI
trail on the southeastern edge of
campus. According to the environ
mental groups, the trail would not
adequately connect to the
Arastradero preserve and would
pose serious environmental and
safety risks.
Parts of the SI trail cross sensi
tive red-legged frog habitats, and
the trail would <*ross a busy stretch
of Interstate 280.
But Universitx officials saitl the
alternative proposals would make
unacceptably large cuts into the
campus rather than staving at the
periphery.
"1 don't question that they may
conclude there are better routes
given their goals," Etchemendy
said. "But [their routes] may not
be the best routes given the more
complex set of goals that I have to
take into consideration, |as it is ]
my responsibility to look out for
the future interests of an institu
tion that will be around for hun
dreds of years."
The comments from last night's
meeting were recorded, and in
early December members of the
County Parks Department will
recommend trail alignments to the
county board of supervisors.

1 he paper contends that the CI
trail along Alpine Road at the
northwestern part of campus is
partly outside of Santa Clara
County and on private lands out
side of campus, a fact they claim
runs contrary to the agreement.
" These trails were meant to
mitigate the impact of five million
square feet of developments
which Stanford has been allowed
to build," said Peter Drekmeier of
the Stanford Open Space Al
liance. Drekmeier saitl that ac
cording to the GUP, the trails
should be on Stanford lands with
in Santa ( lara county.
The University disagrees. "It's
true that some of it is not on Stan
lord land, and it's (rue that a large
part ol it is not in Santa (-lara coun
ty," Provost John Ktchemendy
said of the CI trail. "What's not

true is that this runs contrary to
the General Use Permit."
I'he public forum also wit
nessed much dispute about the SI
trail on the southeastern edge of
campus. According to the environ
mental groups, the trail would not
adequately connect to the
Arastradero preserve and would
pose serious environmental and
safety risks.
Parts of the SI trail cross sensi
tive red-legged frog habitats, and
the trail would <*ross a busy stretch
of Interstate 280.
But Universitx officials saitl the
alternative proposals would make
unacceptably large cuts into the
campus rather than staving at the
periphery.
"1 don't question that they may
conclude there are better routes
given their goals," Etchemendy
said. "But [their routes] may not
be the best routes given the more
complex set of goals that I have to
take into consideration, |as it is ]
my responsibility to look out for
the future interests of an institu
tion that will be around for hun
dreds of years."
The comments from last night's
meeting were recorded, and in
early December members of the
County Parks Department will
recommend trail alignments to the
county board of supervisors.
