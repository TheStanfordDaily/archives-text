## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK STAFF WRITER 
1 lie American Association of
University Women's Legal Advo
cacy Fund has added a fourth
plaintiff to its sexual-discrimina
tion lawsuit against Stanford. Bar
bara Albert, a 199b graduate of
the Medical School, alleges th.it
Stanford broke its promise to pro
ted her from further discrimina
tion after she charged a promi
nent faculty member with sexual
harassment.
When Albert was a student at
Stanford, the faculty member
threatened to destroy her career if
she did not submit to his sexual ad
vances. Zylbert reported the inci
dent to the University but did not
come forward with formal charges,
fearing that a lawsuit would dam
age her career. Stanford encour
aged her to file charges and
promised her protection from fur
ther prejudice if she did.
In a written and verbal agree
ment with Zylbert, Stanford
promised that it would protect her
and help her investigate any fu
ture discrimination. Zylbert did
file a formal complaint against the
faculty member, who issued a for
mal apology.
When Zylbert went to a one
year transitional residency pro
gram at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center, she complained to Stan
ford of discrimination and asked
that the University intervene on

her behalf .
According to the statement of
the case on www.gender
equity.org, "In response [to this re
quest], Stanford repudiated its
obligations and abruptly terminat
ed what had been, up to this time,
its continuing efforts with [Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center] on
Zylbert's behalf."
The University also would not
allow Zylbert to perform training
rotations at Stanford Hospital,
which were a regular part of the
residency program. Following
these actions, Zylbert decided to
sue Stanford.
According to a memorandum
released by the University General
Counsel's office, "Stanford had le
gitimate, non-retaliatory reasons
for its decision."
The statement cites Zylbert's
"out of control" behavior at Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center and
her failure to "complete even the
first year of two other post-gradu
ate residency programs she had
dropped out of before getting to
[Santa Clara Valley Medical Cen
ter]." The memorandum con
cludes that "there is no evidence
that Stanford's reasons were a pre
text for unlawful retaliation for her
complaint seven years earlier."
"We believe her claims are not
meritorious," said Debra Zumwalt,
the University's general counsel.
"We believe that we've complied
