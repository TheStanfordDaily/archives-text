# Med School grad joins sex discrimination suit
## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK STAFF WRITER 
1 lie American Association of
University Women's Legal Advo
cacy Fund has added a fourth
plaintiff to its sexual-discrimina
tion lawsuit against Stanford. Bar
bara Albert, a 199b graduate of
the Medical School, alleges th.it
Stanford broke its promise to pro
ted her from further discrimina
tion after she charged a promi
nent faculty member with sexual
harassment.
When Albert was a student at
Stanford, the faculty member
threatened to destroy her career if
she did not submit to his sexual ad
vances. Zylbert reported the inci
dent to the University but did not
come forward with formal charges,
fearing that a lawsuit would dam
age her career. Stanford encour
aged her to file charges and
promised her protection from fur
ther prejudice if she did.
In a written and verbal agree
ment with Zylbert, Stanford
promised that it would protect her
and help her investigate any fu
ture discrimination. Zylbert did
file a formal complaint against the
faculty member, who issued a for
mal apology.
When Zylbert went to a one
year transitional residency pro
gram at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center, she complained to Stan
ford of discrimination and asked
that the University intervene on

her behalf .
According to the statement of
the case on www.gender
equity.org, "In response [to this re
quest], Stanford repudiated its
obligations and abruptly terminat
ed what had been, up to this time,
its continuing efforts with [Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center] on
Zylbert's behalf."
The University also would not
allow Zylbert to perform training
rotations at Stanford Hospital,
which were a regular part of the
residency program. Following
these actions, Zylbert decided to
sue Stanford.
According to a memorandum
released by the University General
Counsel's office, "Stanford had le
gitimate, non-retaliatory reasons
for its decision."
The statement cites Zylbert's
"out of control" behavior at Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center and
her failure to "complete even the
first year of two other post-gradu
ate residency programs she had
dropped out of before getting to
[Santa Clara Valley Medical Cen
ter]." The memorandum con
cludes that "there is no evidence
that Stanford's reasons were a pre
text for unlawful retaliation for her
complaint seven years earlier."
"We believe her claims are not
meritorious," said Debra Zumwalt,
the University's general counsel.
"We believe that we've complied
fully with our agreement with her."
Dan Siegel, Albert's attorney,
said, " 1 he debate is over what is it
thai we would have to prove to
convince the court that there was
a relationship between the prob
lems with the internship and
Stanford. There is no
doubt . . . people teased [Zylbert]
about what happened at Stan
ford. Is that enough? Or is the
court going to require that we
prove that someone from Stan
lord contacted them and told
them directly [to harass her|?"
"I'm hopeful that Stanford has
come full circle," Zylbert said. She
explained that when this case began
10 years ago, the administration was
conclucive to at Idressing gender dis
crimination at Stanford, but that the
subsequent administration did not
deal with these issues. "Now we
have a new administration that I
hope will be very understanding to
discrimination."
Currently, Stanford is seeking
rejudgment of the case, claiming
that Albert does not have ;i case
against the University. "\\V are
hopeful that [the rejudgment] will

eliminate the case," Zumwalt said.
Zylbert's trial date is set for Feb.
19, 2002. Between now and then,
Siegel and his defense team will rx
amine depositions, collect expert
depositions and attend settlement
meetings.
"I hope (Stanford] will settle be
cause what we really want more
than money is for Stanford to train
Zylbert," he said.
Zylbert agreed, saying, "1 never
had problems with anyone else at
Stanford, I never experienced dis
crimination from anyone else at
Stanford. 1 would love to come
back to Stanford.'"
Zvlbert cited the support of ll
liott Wolfe, associate dean for stu
dent affairs at the Medical School,
whom she said lias supported her
throughout the legal process.
Wolfe knew Zylbert during her
years at Stanford, as a dean and as
a professor.
"I've been tying to help her even
though I'm an employee in the
University," he said. "I've been put
in a strange position."
Zylbert said she is "optimistic"
about the outcome of the case. "It
would be tremendous for Stan
ford to welcome me back, it
would show that they're turning
a new leaf and honoring their
promises," she said.
