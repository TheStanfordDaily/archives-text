# SCN finds 'Remedy' in Jewish rap artist
## Wu – Tang disciple fights hate through hip-hop 
### A.J. MAGNUSON 
The I lolocaust was never some
tiling to rap about, Hebrew
prayers never had a beat behind
them and Jewish issues were never
introduced to the hip-hop world
until Reuven Ben-Menachem
picked up a microphone.
Remedy, a Jewish rap artist in
troduced by the Wu-Tang family,
will perform cuts from his new
solo album, "Genuine Article," to
the Stanford campus tomorrow at
8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium. I he
event, hosted by the Stanford
Concert Network and the Stan
ford Israel Alliance, will address
issues of hate.
The rapper's trip to the West
Coast comes at the invitation of
Bay Area Jewish student groups
responding to recent acts of anti-
Semitism at San Francisco State
University.
Remedy's fame in the rap world
has come mainly under the guid
ance of the Wu-Tang Clan, who
have let him t ip it up on albums
and underground tracks. But he
secured his place in the hip-hop
world by engaging the Jewish
community with biting rhymes
and angry beats.
I lis underlying themes in songs
such as the lamenting "Never

Again" — "Another life
lost / count the cost / Another
body gassed, burned and
tossed / in the Holocaust," are in
tended to combat all hate.
"I don't wanna be known for
just being down for the Jews, I'm
here to represent humanity," the
rapper has said.
"It's awesome that lie's educat
ing through entertainment," said
senior Rachael Neumann, the
concert network's public relations
official. "It's an anti-hate show,
hut it will be an amazing hip-hop
performance."
1 lip-hop fans will have more to
look forward to tomorrow. Adding
to the appeal of the show will be
4th Avenue Jones, a 10-piece hip
hop I),ind from Los Angeles. The
live band group has been signed
by Interscope Records and will
take the stage before Remedy.
"Remedy is stoked to perform
on the day of Big (lame," said con
cert network director Jenny
Quito/, a senior. "We hope it will
be sold out."
Setli Stephens, a member of
Alpha Kpsilon Pi, ;i Jewish frater
nity supporting the party, said he
anticipates a successful show.
"What's a better way to bring
the Stanford community together
than a great show fora good cause
in celebration of another Big
(lame victory?" he said.
Students can attend the show
for $5 with SUID.
