1970
On Nov. 20, 1970, The Daily printed an
article on Cal's Big Game antics:
"The Daily ('.alifornian reported on
1 uesday, I lie people' - (that s us) - will en
gage in water warfare with ilie mass of dem
agogic avaricious ruling-class bufoons who
are known as the leland Stanford JI \ lOR
university [sic] rooting section.
"Water warfare will take the traditional
Berkeleyian form of shooting water bal
loons at the Stanford rooters, an art form
which in recent years has reached a low
state at the Kast Bay campus.
"In 19()(), the Berkeley pranksters
showered the Stanford rooters with water
balloons in the midst of a drenching
downpour. I he next two years the clever
diaps' aim failed miserably doing nothing
but slightly dampening the tracks around
the fields.
" The Berkeley administration has re
portedlv threatened to exercise no controls
over the ballooners if the Stanford band
flauntingly displays a Cal band uniform lib
erated several years back."
Bottom Line: When it rains, we snore.
