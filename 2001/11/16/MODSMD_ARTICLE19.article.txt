A respected heart surgeon who
bought three Las Vegas strip clubs to
finance his medical research has
been forced to sell them because of
bad publicity.
Dr. Simon Stertzer.; who bought the
all-nude Palomino Club and two top
less bars, said "adverse characteriza
tioni" of the deal had compelled him to
strip the assets.
"He went in with really great inten
tions and everyone made a really big
deal out of nothing," his lawyer Mark
Nicoletti said of the adverse publicity.
Dr. Stertzer,; of Stanford University, is
a pioneer of balloon angioplasty, a
procedure to repair or replace dam
aged blood vessels.
But University officials were con
cerned about the purchase of the strip
clubs and worried that money from
them might be used at the medical
school.
"Morally, I think it's a little odd to
sell flesh on one end so you can repair
it on another " said Stephanie Smith
of the Las Vegas City Council, which
approved the licensing for Dr. Stertzer.
"But that's part of the joy of living in
Nevada. We're a little different."
