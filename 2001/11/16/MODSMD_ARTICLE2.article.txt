Every player on the football
field diet ks his statistic s.
I lie defensive lineman keeps

track of his sacks. I he running
hack strives for 100-yard games.
Even the punter measures his
worth in numbers.
Hnt the names of'offensive line
man are conspicuously absent
from the post game numbers.

Linebackers smothered, blitzes
thwarted and cornerbacks pan
caked are left out of the box score.
Yet if these numbers were
kept, No. 13 Stanford's linemen
would surely In- near the top of
the national standings.

Football is the ultimate team
sport, where individuals don't
succeed without collective efforts.
I hough not thrust into the lime
light as other Cardinal game
breakers, Stanford's offensive line
is just as responsible for the (Cardi

one of'college football's best offen

Exhibit A is senior tailback
Brian Allen. Allen has rushed lor
797 yards this season, and with his
nearly 100-yard average is on
pace to break Stanford's single
season rushing record of 1,084
yards by Tommy Vardell. Not to
diminish Allen's talent, but could
he ever turn the corner for one of

even more attention.

are Stanford's Irene h warriors:
Eric Heitmann, the Leader:
Heitmann.s musical prowess
has been well doc umenled. I su;il
l\ composing songs after football
games, Heitmann lias created
some sweet music in the t rent lies as
well this season.
In short yardage situations,
Cardinal running backs usually
rim right behind I leitmann, who

uses his great leverage to win
one-on-one battles with opposing
defenders.
A second team All-conference
selection last season, Ileitniann
should gain first-team honors
this season in addition to some
NFL suitors.
Zack Quaccia, the General:
Often playing injured this sea
son. Quaccia's toughness lias never
been questioned by his teammates.
As the center, Quaccia organizes
the line superbly.
"Your center needs to be the
quarterback at the line of scrim
mage," said offensive line coach
John McDonell. "Zack does that at
the line of scrimmage by making
line calls and getting everybody in
the right place."
Kwame Harris, the Phenom:
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham wanted the nation's
top high school lineman so badly in
1999 that he visited Harris in
Delaware during the middle of a
blizzard. The stor\ of how Harris
cooked Willingham dinner while
his mother walked in with a "Stan
ford Mom" sweater will be in

grained in Stanford lore.
Greg Schindler, The domina
tor:
After moving to right guard
during spring workouts, the red
shirt junior has excelled at his new
position. I lis play has been instru
mental not only in Stanford's rush
ing attack, hut also in the Cardinal's
ability to protect its quarterbacks to
enable them to fuel Stanford's
high-octane passing attack.
Kirk Chambers, Man on a Mis
sion:
Ilighlv sought-after during his
high s( hool career, (lhambers went
on a Mormon mission to Berlin for
two years before earning a starting
spot at left tackle in 2000.
With two more years of eligibili
ty after this season, the sophomore
will be one of the conf erence's best
tackles for a while.
Chambers is also a newlywed,
and credits his marriage with pro
viding focus, as well as home
cooked post game meals.
"Getting married has brought a
lot of stability to my life," Chambers

games, Heitmann lias created
some sweet music in the t rent lies as

In short yardage situations,

uses his great leverage to win
one-on-one battles with opposing
defenders.
A second team All-conference
selection last season, Ileitniann

this season in addition to some
NFL suitors.
Zack Quaccia, the General:
Often playing injured this sea
son. Quaccia's toughness lias never
been questioned by his teammates.
As the center, Quaccia organizes
the line superbly.
"Your center needs to be the
quarterback at the line of scrim
mage," said offensive line coach
John McDonell. "Zack does that at
the line of scrimmage by making
line calls and getting everybody in
the right place."
Kwame Harris, the Phenom:
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham wanted the nation's
top high school lineman so badly in
1999 that he visited Harris in
Delaware during the middle of a
blizzard. The stor\ of how Harris
cooked Willingham dinner while
his mother walked in with a "Stan
ford Mom" sweater will be in

Greg Schindler, The domina

After moving to right guard
during spring workouts, the red
shirt junior has excelled at his new
position. I lis play has been instru
mental not only in Stanford's rush

ability to protect its quarterbacks to

Ilighlv sought-after during his
high s( hool career, (lhambers went
on a Mormon mission to Berlin for
two years before earning a starting
spot at left tackle in 2000.
With two more years of eligibili

Stanford is tied for the conferem e

I suall) when an offensive line
makes huge deposits iu its team's
si let ess, it still comes up short at the

credit hank. Bui Stanford's ()-line
is too talented this year to ignore.
At the season's outset players
and coat lies agreed that the

its experience on the line of
scrimmage. Expectations were
high when ESPN talent scout Mel
Kiper ranked Stanford's line as
the fifth best in the country, and
.is the year has progressed and
Stanford has i idden its offense to
a (i-2 record and reached as high
as No. 10 in the nation, Heit
mann and company have gotten
even more attention.
I hough the line as a unit has
been collect ivel) praised, it's indi
vidual components are still rela

are Stanford's Irene h warriors:
Eric Heitmann, the Leader:
Heitmann.s musical prowess
has been well doc umenled. I su;il
l\ composing songs after football
games, Heitmann lias created
some sweet music in the t rent lies as
well this season.
In short yardage situations,
Cardinal running backs usually
rim right behind I leitmann, who

uses his great leverage to win
one-on-one battles with opposing
defenders.
A second team All-conference
selection last season, Ileitniann
should gain first-team honors
this season in addition to some
NFL suitors.
Zack Quaccia, the General:
Often playing injured this sea
son. Quaccia's toughness lias never
been questioned by his teammates.
As the center, Quaccia organizes
the line superbly.
"Your center needs to be the
quarterback at the line of scrim
mage," said offensive line coach
John McDonell. "Zack does that at
the line of scrimmage by making
line calls and getting everybody in
the right place."
Kwame Harris, the Phenom:
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham wanted the nation's
top high school lineman so badly in
1999 that he visited Harris in
Delaware during the middle of a
blizzard. The stor\ of how Harris
cooked Willingham dinner while
his mother walked in with a "Stan
ford Mom" sweater will be in

grained in Stanford lore.
Greg Schindler, The domina
tor:
After moving to right guard
during spring workouts, the red
shirt junior has excelled at his new
position. I lis play has been instru
mental not only in Stanford's rush
ing attack, hut also in the Cardinal's
ability to protect its quarterbacks to
enable them to fuel Stanford's
high-octane passing attack.
Kirk Chambers, Man on a Mis
sion:
Ilighlv sought-after during his
high s( hool career, (lhambers went
on a Mormon mission to Berlin for
two years before earning a starting
spot at left tackle in 2000.
With two more years of eligibili
ty after this season, the sophomore
will be one of the conf erence's best
tackles for a while.
Chambers is also a newlywed,
and credits his marriage with pro
viding focus, as well as home
cooked post game meals.
"Getting married has brought a
lot of stability to my life," Chambers
slid. "Sin 's ,i m>« »cl cook, «ind she

I liese columnists were right;

makes the defenders better.
