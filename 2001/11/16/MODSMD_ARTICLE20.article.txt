## 
### CYNTHIA CHO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At tomorrow's Big Game
against Cal. there will be much of
the same spirit, energy and rivalry
that have always marked this 104-
year-old Stanford tradition. How
ever, there will be a change at this
year's game â€” compared to past
Nig Games, there will be height
ened security both on campus and
at the stadium.
"There are increased security
measures being taken [at this
year's game] because of the
events of Sept. 1 1 and because of
the uncertainty of the environ
ment," said Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Moore.
"The Stanford University De
partment ol Public Safety, in con
junction with the Athletic Depart
ment and the University adminis
trations from both Cal and Stan
ford, have developed a compre
hensive security plan designed to
ensure the safety of the patrons,
players and staff," said Lieutenant
Laura Wilson.
Elements of the plan include in
specting patrons' belongings upon
entry into the stadium and rest rid
ing the types of items that are al
lowed into the stadium. Among
the items on the list of prohibited
items include alcohol, glass, cans,
backpacks and bags larger than
10" by 10" by 10".
"This list will be enforced strict

ly at the game," Moore said.
There will also be an increased
number of both sworn and non
sworn officers inside and outside
the stadium, according to Wilson.
I he sworn officers, from the
UCPD and the Santa Clara Coun
ty Sheriff's Office, will be on cam
pus to assist with security matters.
During the game, there will be a
large number of officers patrolling
the sidelines and endlines to pre
vent students from running onto
the field.
"We do not want students on
the field regardless of the outcome
of the game," said Moore. "They
will make arrests if they have to,"
he continued.
To further prevent crowds
from rushing the field, the bottom
10 rows in the student section will
be blocked off, according to Assoc.
Athletic Director Ray Purpur.
"Anyone coming onto the field
will be subject to trespassing and
the ramifications. We will also be
videotaping the crowd to identify
people causing problems," said
Pin pur.
After the game, there will be an
increased number of security per
sonnel walking around campus.
"Their purpose will be to detect
any kind of vandalism, to detect
disruptions and potential dangers
to the community and to secure
the environment," said Moore.
Although the events of Sept. 1 1
have increased everyone's aware-

ness ofsecurity issues, those partic
ipating in the game said they feel
they will be safe on and off the field
come Saturday.
While he said "there could al
ways be something that goes
wrong that has nothing to do with
Sept.l 1," Asst. Coach Dave Tipton
said he chooses not to worry about
those issues, because once you
start, there is no end. Instead, he is
focused on winning the game.
free Chuck Armstrong, a
sophomore, said he feels safe being
at the game. Iwo members from

the Free Protection Sen ice, each
of whom will have a concealed can
of mase and / or Hash bomb, w ill be
guarding Armstrong.
.\s lias been the c ast 1 for the past
two Trees at Stanford Stadium Big
(iames, Armstrong will not be al
lowed to be on the field for the pre
game or halftime shows.
Moore advises students to use
good judgment and common
sense at the game.
"View the game as a friendly ri
valry," Moore s.iid. "I lave fun, but
don't be stupid."
