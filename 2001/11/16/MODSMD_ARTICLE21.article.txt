# Cuban: computers underused in teaching
## 
### ANTHONY HA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Apparently, not everyone is
convinced that computers have
revolutionized the way students
learn.
1 n his new book "()versold and
Underused," Emeritus Professor
of Education Larry Cuban chal
lenges educational dogma with a
critical examination of the use of
computers in both K-12 educa
tion and universities. He argues
that computers, while widely pro
moted as a tool that would trans
form both teaching and learning,
have not been properly utilized
in education.
"I had written a book on earlier
technologies that tried to trans
form classrooms called ' 1 eac hers
and Machines,' " Cuban said. "So
in the late 1990s I wanted to see
what impact the computer had on
classroom teaching and learning."
Cuban said that he was sur

prised by what he found — that
the growth in access to computers
in schools led neither to a corre
sponding growth in use by teach
ers and students nor to substantial
changes in the educational
process, and that teachers and stu
dents seemed to use computers
more in the home and office than
in the classroom.
I le pointed to a lack of commu
nication between educators and
the promoters of educational
technology as a key source of the
problem.
"The lack of communication
and coordination —and respect,
I might add —with educators,
and promoters' unwillingness to
listen carefully to many teachers'
concerns. . . are legitimate issues
that block teacher cooperation at
all levels," Cuban explained.
"That most software applica
tions were originally designed for
businesses, not schools, and that
vendors seldom . . . revise designs

on t he basis of testing speaks again
to the inherent arrogance and
condescension that afflict relations
between vendors, software devel
opers and educators," he added.
Rich 1 loleton, head of Residen
tial Computing and a longtime
teacher, said that he has not read
Cuban's book, but disagrees with
his claim that computers have not
transformed the educational
process.
"It's clear to me that they have
played an increasingly crucial
role in our entire lives," he said,
pointing to online discussions as
one example of the ways in which
technology has transformed
learning. "There are few aspects
of our lives that haven't been af
fected by computers."
Holeton said that Stanford is
trying to increase the use of com
puters in instruction through the
Academic Technology Specialist
Program, which is designed to raise
faculty awareness and effective use

of technology in the education.
"They're trying to find peda
gogically useful ways to integrate
the computer into the classroom."
Holeton explained. "It's a very
successful program. I hey go far
beyond what I fear that Larry
Cuban looked at."
Cuban did say that the poten
tial exists for computers to be used
more widely in the instructional
process itself, and cited as exam
ples the few instances where he
had seen it occur.
"In visiting so many schools as
a researcher and as a former high
school teacher and school super
intendent, I have seen marvelous
examples at all levels of schooling
of inspired and imaginative uses
of computers being integrated
into instruction," he said.
"Students' responses to such
instruction were enthusiastic,
thoughtful and, in my judgment,
led to deep learning," he added.
