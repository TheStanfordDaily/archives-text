Students looking to make their
spring break into something more
meaningful than the typical vaca
tion have only today left to sign up
for an .Alternative Spring Break —
applications for the program are
clue at 5 p.m. at the I laas Center.
ASB learning projects are de
signed to give Stanford students the
chance to go beyond the walls of
their private, privileged institution
to explore and learn about societal
issues through various hands-on
service experiences, according to
the program's mission statement.
"Ever since the summer of my
freshman year, I've been doing a lot
of thinking about what it is I want to
do with my life, both during Stanford
and after I leave," said junior Shaival
Shah, co-leader of the HIV/AIDS
New York trip this year. "I ultimate
ly decided that I wanted to do some
thing that would impact the commu
nity positively."
The HIV /AIDS trip to New
York is an opportunity to under
stand the social, economic and c ul
tural factors surrounding the pan
demit and engage with people who
live and survive with HIV everyday
and those that have dedicated their
lives to serving them.
Other programs include trips to
San Francisco, Hawaii, East Palo
Alto, Yosemite, Salt Like City and
Na\ aj< > and Mescalero Apache com
munities.
For one to two units winter quar
ter, trip participants take a special
ized directed reading course, which
trip leaders and faculty advisors fa
cilitate to equip participants with
background knowledge of the indi

vidual trip's relevant issues.
Then trip participants immerse
themselves in direct sen ice and en
gage policymakers to critically ex
amine and experience the urgent
reality of crucial issues over Spring
Break.
"It's been quite the learning ex
perience and always continues to
be," said senior Jenny Wu, an ASB
program coordinator. "I think it's
an invaluable way to connect and
contextualize my academics with
the world outside of me."
"I've also gotten to know some of
the most amazing people and heard
some of the most inspiring stories,
both in my peers and the communi
ty members I've met through my
trips," Wu added.
"Spring break itself was an amaz
ing experience because we were liv
ing, eating, learning and serving in
East Palo Alto for the- whole week
and we really got a sense of the com
munity, both its strengths and strug
gles," said senior Lindsay Austin, an
ASB coordinator and leader of the
ASB trip to East Palo Alto.
The ASB program started at
Stanford in the mid-1980s and has
grown into a program that is now
the largest service-learning organi
zation on campus.
"We will involve over 200 stu
dents this year," said Austin.
"I love being a coordinator Ix--
cause I make this magic happen for
other trip leaders by helping handle
all the behind-the-scenes work for
the program, including publicity,
fundraising [and] training trip lead
ers," Austin said.
"It is the lx»th the compassion and
passion of the trip leaders and the
participants who truly keep this pnv
gram afloat," Wusaid.
