## The 						Stanford Daily Cal ought to put up a better fight or just give up

(ok.iv, make that little) soul-searching
debate, we have concluded that CAL
Sl'(lkS. Yes, despite the elaborate vo
cabularies of our student body, when it tomes to
Berkeley, these two simple words seem to do the
trii k better than any other charactcri/ation we
can think of
For those of you not familial with that ill-lilted
school across the Bay, the I 'niversitv of (California
at Berkeley, or Cal, is the oldest campus in the
University of California system. I he niajorih <>l
its student Ihklv is from (California and has either
grown up with dreams of going to Stanford, onl\
to be rejected, 01 has been raised to revile the (Car
dinal ret I In their (lal alumni ancestors win > them
selves were rejected Irom Stanford.
Fithcr way, there is ninth entrenched bit
terness. Add to this resentment the I'act that
Cal routinely loses out I«> Stanford in ncarh

every academic and athletic arena and you
begin to comprehend the extent of their anti-
Stanford sentiment.
I lowevcr. while it may be fun to demolish Cal
year after year after year in Big (iaine and nearly
every other sporting competition, we feel that our
titunination of the (loltlen Bears is getting a little
redundant. We believe that Stanford is deserving
<>! a niut h more worthy opponent. Fither Berke
ley needs to pit kit up or we want a new rival!
Fath year, someone in the community feels the
need to bring to light Stanford students' lack
adaisical attitude toward our rivalry with Cal.
While those weenies in the Fast Bay are win king
themselves into a l< >ainingfrcnzv in anticipation of
the big event and the unrealistic opportunity ol
at tually winning this year, we tend to look at Big
(iame as just another excuse to party. I 'rue, there
are those freshman who get their kicks out of
t banting "salct\ school", but in realitv our school

spirit is much milder and much less vicious than
our rival's.
I his is not a general delect with Stanford stu
dents, Inn rather the effect of ;t bloated sense ol
complacency. We at Stanford have tlie luxurv ol
taking lor granted our'position as victor and van
quisher because it happens with such frequency.
But the thrill of victory would taste much sweeter
il it weren't experienced so often. Perhaps a little
losing wouldn't be such a bad thing.
No. no, no, Ihe Daily is not suggest ing that los
ing to Cal would be a good thing. Sacrilege! In
stead. we suggest that if Berkeley can't stand the
heat, it should get out of the kitchen. Stanford
needs a rivalry with a school th.it is actually our
equal. Since ( a\ claims to Ik- our rival, it ought to
back its words up with some action. It is only when
Stanford is seriously challenged that our student
bod\ c an come to appreciate the rivalry and re
spect the rival itself.

And really, jx h>l Cal. The years <>t losing has
cultivated within their campus community a mas
sive inlerioritv complex that really isn't healthy.
As a result, their student Ixxly has become in
creasingly angry, embittered . . . and violent!
(ioing to Berkeley in a Stanford shirt brings risk
of verbal abuse and bodily harm. Our lice can
not even wear his costume in peace at the end of
Big (iame. ( herall. the atmosphere of Stanford-
Cal games has degenerated Irom spirited com
petition to an adolescent exchange between bit
tei Berkeley and smug Stanford.' 1 his is not the
way to share a rivalry.
Mavbe, just maylx*, C.al will surprise us this
year, resurrect itself from the dead and actually
give us a game. For the health of Our rivalry, it
would Ik- ,i welcome change. But if all goes as
planned, savor our (">()-() rout of the Golden
Bears and hope that Berkeley will work on
bringing more to the table in the future.

While those weenies in the Fast Bay are win king
themselves into a l< >ainingfrcnzv in anticipation of
the big event and the unrealistic opportunity ol
at tually winning this year, we tend to look at Big
(iame as just another excuse to party. I 'rue, there
are those freshman who get their kicks out of
t banting "salct\ school", but in realitv our school

spirit is much milder and much less vicious than
our rival's.
I his is not a general delect with Stanford stu
dents, Inn rather the effect of ;t bloated sense ol
complacency. We at Stanford have tlie luxurv ol
taking lor granted our'position as victor and van
quisher because it happens with such frequency.
But the thrill of victory would taste much sweeter
il it weren't experienced so often. Perhaps a little
losing wouldn't be such a bad thing.
No. no, no, Ihe Daily is not suggest ing that los
ing to Cal would be a good thing. Sacrilege! In
stead. we suggest that if Berkeley can't stand the
heat, it should get out of the kitchen. Stanford
needs a rivalry with a school th.it is actually our
equal. Since ( a\ claims to Ik- our rival, it ought to
back its words up with some action. It is only when
Stanford is seriously challenged that our student
bod\ c an come to appreciate the rivalry and re
spect the rival itself.

And really, jx h>l Cal. The years <>t losing has
cultivated within their campus community a mas
sive inlerioritv complex that really isn't healthy.
As a result, their student Ixxly has become in
creasingly angry, embittered . . . and violent!
(ioing to Berkeley in a Stanford shirt brings risk
of verbal abuse and bodily harm. Our lice can
not even wear his costume in peace at the end of
Big (iame. ( herall. the atmosphere of Stanford-
Cal games has degenerated Irom spirited com
petition to an adolescent exchange between bit
tei Berkeley and smug Stanford.' 1 his is not the
way to share a rivalry.
Mavbe, just maylx*, C.al will surprise us this
year, resurrect itself from the dead and actually
give us a game. For the health of Our rivalry, it
would Ik- ,i welcome change. But if all goes as
planned, savor our (">()-() rout of the Golden
Bears and hope that Berkeley will work on
bringing more to the table in the future.
