# TWO AND A HALF GUYS WHO ARE BETTER THAN YOU
## Stanford's strip club genius 
### 
There are certain weeks where
this I niversity's academic de
mands are too ninth even lot
Iwo («n\s Who Are llctlci I lian on..
So with lh.it in mind. hul most I \ out
dedication to giving new ai lists a chancc in
tlieii respetlive cndeavoi s, we invited oni
friend /ach (lerson to he .1 guest co
columnist this week. We proposed <ni \ ill
him .in opportunitx .11 lame. Idrtnne and
writing a lot ol words. I lie important
point ol all of this is: il there's am tiling von
don't like this week, hlame hint.
Anyway, it's become cleai in the past
month that Stanford sometimes mis
places its adulation loi 011-campus ac
complishments. Recently, Prof. ('.hristo-

pher (.11\ h.i w .is award
ed the Mac Arthur (.e
-nins Award, therein giv
ing him llie right lo le
gitimately t .til hitiiscll ,t
genius m an\ casual so
cial interaction. Reallv,
the onl) thing U lt lor
tlu' professor to at hieve
is having two girls dou-

hle up 011 him. And wit h
his new $500,000, he t ould prob
ably work that out.
I lie Mac Arthur foundation,
unfortunately, overlooked the
true genius ol anothei Stanford
faculty member: Professor of
Medicine Simon "Strip Club"
Stert/er. I le is truh an cxemplai
of human intelligence and te-

soukefillness. Shockingly, a significant
port it >n of lb is campus has not vet heard
of the genius ol this keen, keen re
searcher and his innovative methods ol
112 undraising.
()n Sept. 5, 2001. Prof. Stei l/er made
a striking loray in his c|iicst for metlical
advancement. If \ou are siill reading
this, you might ask: how did he tit) Ihi sr
I .atlies and gentlemen, he opened three
strip clubs in I .as Vegas. \ol jusi lor fun,
mind you. I lie clubs — or Institutes of
Ktlmographit Studies, as we like to tall
them — would provide the funding for
his cardiovascular rcseart h.
You may be confused. You may
think you read wrong. You ma) not
know how to read al all. Put let il be
proclaimed, once again, with trumpet
ing fanfare: one of our own, in this aca
demic family, opened strip dubs it)
fund his research. In the words ol the
genius himself: "Whatever will provide
cash flow will do." Word.

foi some reason, the I imcisiiv. the
Mac \rihn 1 foundation and society at
lai ge are not giving him his duet red it.
\\ li\ lias lie not heen featured 011 Stan
lord's home page? \\ 11 \ hasn't he \ei
heen requested l>\ the administration
to te.u li a seminal on his funding tec h
nicjues during Parents Weekend? lo
he clear, the basis (01 his genius is not in
Ins objectilic.ition ol women, but ralhei
Ins rcvolution.ii \ new methods ol
fundraising in a traditionall\ closed
minded field. W'e are taking this oppor
tunitn to salute the trailhla/ing spirit that
Prol. Stert/ei showed 111 the inevitable
battle to acquire funding 111 ac aclemia.
We can all agree — bee a use we sa\ so

that the goal t>l an\
educational institution
is It) disc o\ei and sliai e
\\ 01 t liw Inle data. So
Doug and Ramit, along
with /.at h. would like to
extrapolate the profes
sor's findings to illus
trate that, in addition to
the tangible contribu-

titius Prof. Stert/er has
made lo the met lit al community,
students like you can benefit
from lus example. B\ gettingt re
alise in the vein ol the professor,
\ou can gel mone\ with little to
mi hassle.
Consider I l\( )s: the) are a
great method for obtaining
moncN for legitimate acadcmit

interests, but the\ contain needless rc
t|iiiienients such as "paperwork" and
"latultN support." Inferior students
w ill continue submitting I l\() applica
tions, where.is the* innovative student
will break into the URO office. We
don't recommend this. Hut il vou do it,
don't you think we deserve half of
whatever you get for the idea?
While lesser minds may have fol
lowed traditional routes of funding,
sue h as "appl\ ing fora National Science
Foundation grant," or "publishing pa
pers." our wil\ old professor was not
afraid to push traditional frontiers of
the Iralernit) of academia. Some have
found his methods distasteful, but we
rccogni/e il for what il is: true genius.
And hey, it's not like il was prostitution.

Dong, Rami! and Zach arc not kidding: check
lmrs.Mdioo.com and scorch for "Steifzer." E
irifiil nun it (d Stanford.edit and we will read xonr
e-mail and d will he ven nice.
