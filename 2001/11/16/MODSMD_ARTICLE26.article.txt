Mac Donald a 'skilled, dedicated, in
formed' leader
I have been a close friend of Andrew
Mac Donald since Kail quarter 1 ( .) ( .)S. I
write I his response to I he Daih art icle of
Oil. 2 not to att.u k the Asian-American
Student Association, hui to defend a man
who has been misundct stood and unlairl)
judged for some time. 1 fe has earned im
trust and respect man) times over, and 1
wish to convc) the- positive side of his stor\
that the pre\ ions at tic le overlooked.
M.u Donald is a skilled, dedicated, in
formed and caring leader. Hut even great
leaders can not effective!) function in the
teeth of internal opposition and resent
ment. I lie Stanford community may
hlamc Mac Donald for this controversy
and consider his resignation as a defeat,
hut that is a skewed perspective. Me
showed great moral courage trying to per
form his duties as c hair amidst the lieaw
skepticism and scrutiny that routinely
hounded him.
I am not an expert on the facts sur
rounding Mac Donald's abridged term as
AASA (.hair and his recent decision to step
down. But I know that he had diverse and
broad goals for the future of the AASA or
ganization. Kvcn il they were not feasible
or beneficial in his critics' opinions, there is
no doubt in my mind that he was, and will
continue to be, a faithful advocate to the
betterment of the Asian-American com
munity at Stanford.
I know that I can not speak lot tlu" en
tire Asian-Americ an community at Stan
ford. but I did not consider Mac Donald's
elec lion as a blow to Asian-American polit
ic al empowerment, as some have claimed.
I he shameful blow to empowerment was
the lad that he ran unopposed. I low can

AASA claim that Mac Donald was not a
suitable candidate for the position and
then seek out a supposeclh superior re
placement who did not even lake" a stand
iu the original election?
Although I never doubted Mac Don
ald's potential to be a good AASA ('.hair,
even I did not expect him lo win on ac -
(ount of his rate. Nevertheless, the under
dog newcomer with little- internal support
did emerge from the election victorious.
I le attempted to the best of his abilit\ to be
an effective ( hair, but was impeded b\
overwhelming disapproval. Kvcn though
he resigned in the end, lie took bold ac tion
for something he left passionatel) for, and
made his mark on this campus. I lis story
has garnered my sympathy as well as my
admiration. Mac Donald's efforts were a
fine example to AASA of what empower
ment really means.

Playboy should be housed in
physics library
With regard to the article in l ues
clay's edition. 'Playboys stolen front
(Ireen', I have a suggestion for dealing
with the disappearing magazines. I lie
University's subscription to Playboy
should be transferred to the Hubert
Refiner Memorial Library in the Ap
plied Physics building.
I here are several obvious reasons for
the change. I lie typical "Playboy" thief
probably was once a rule-obeying yet
bashful reader at (ireen, someone
hunched over a table with a barely
cracked-open magazine obscuring their
face, which would turn a shade ol red

every time someone walked past. Km
barassment never would have driven this
person lo steal il he or she had been lead
ing at I lellncr. 1 his library li.is a very low
level ol trallic and permits hours .it a time
of perusal without intrusion.
Also, unlike Green's collection,
Hellner is unlocked and unsupervised.
Hellner's patrons have demonstrated
that they can be trusted with many ex
pensive volumes lelt in the open, so I
don't see any reason why their charac
ter would break just because someone
threw one popular glossy in the mix.
Also, il student majors are required
to have breadth, then libraries ought to
Ik- as well. I hough I can think of some
tenuous connections between the sub
ject matter ol "Playboy" and applied
physics, I'm still pretty sure that "Play
boy' would help Refiner big time on
ibis one. I'm sure everyone agrees with
me by now. Ihe University libraries
should take advantage ol 11lis simple
way to keep providing a variety of peri
odicals to the Stanford community.

Bush decision runs counter to Constitution
On I uesday, President Hush granted
himself the power to order military trials
lor suspected terrorists. Apparently, the
pesky concepts of the jury trial and checks
and balances are obstacles to swift justice.
I'he Stanford community, an internation
al community built around an institution
dedicated to progress through the discov
ery <>l truth, should be actively opposed lo
this measure.
I lie administration's rationale is that
terrorists are wart riminals who do not de
serve the protection ol the I S. (Constitu
tion. I'lial s hardly the point. \ccusation
does not prove j^tiilt. Ihe Constitution is
designed to protet I all <>l lis from pel set u
tion by an over/ealous government. I Ins
is accomplished through ti ial In jury and
an elaborate process <>! judicial review.
I lie militai \ action in Mghauistan is evi
dence enough ol the administration's des
peration to punish the guiltv. .11 the price
of innot ent lives.

Thanksgiving, Ramadan should be
examined
As Ramadan begins tins week, I find
nyself in this slate ol dissonance, ponder
ng, "VVh) do I I.ist ?"
I remember nn best Iriend used toca
iuallv tell me how she did not think it was

important to last. Yet, I knew better; it was
mote like her lame justification because
she jnst could not be bothered. I, on the
other hand, would attempt to keep every
last bet ause I lelt like it was displaying my
appreciation to Cod. Ironically though, I
do not show tnv daih appret iation l>\ ad
hering to a modest dress code or refrain
ing Irom other sot ial taboos. So, I definite
ly do not last to be a "good Muslim" but for
the general illusionary satisfaction I get
that I am pursing self-knowledge in expe
i ient inj4 self-dist ipline.
On another note, I have seen people
who think lie, (beat, steal and last reli
giousb. I he\ make me inwardly chuckle
i ynit ally: this one month of fasting should
somehow diminish a tlaib life of sin? Wait,
so win do so main people last during Ra
madan? I here are multiple reasons, but I
wish to explore the most illusionary and
thus disturbing one.
As a little girl, nn parents told me tli.it
lasting taught one self-dist ipline, self-con
trol and especial!) the appreciation of
food. Ramadan is the Islamic month ol
lasting and one ol the Five Pillars of Islam.
Muslims awake to eat and pray .it sun
i ise and break their fasts at sunset. I hiring
Ramadan, I have lelt an unparalleled liar
mom giving foot! to poor people who
have not eaten all day with my own hands.
As I'hanksirivinu" approaches in tan

(lcm, 1 wondered why we celebrate
Thanksgiving. I am sure ii varies Irom
person t.o person. Apart from the welcome
and awaited lew days break, and children
looking forward to.ill that s\ inbolit turke\
and Pilgrim festivities, certainlv a message
of histon. tolerance and indeed thankful
ness is imbedded in this hubbub.
Yet, how many of us can v this message
ola holiday th.it we are almost used to into
our daily lives?
I have alwavs heard of tradition being
viewed as a construct to be revered,
learned from and accorded ninth power
and attention. Yet, 1 would dare to be
heretic, unpatriotic yet "cultured"
enough to claim that brute tradition itself
often renders the reason for the tradition
or its historical significance meaningless.
It often becomes a transient psvchologi
cal and societal illusionan attempt to
make ourselves feel benevolent, thank
ful, tolerant and more. It < an be siinplx a
comfort ol minimal significance lor (lie
most part.
Religious and cultural tradition tleli
nitel) exposes one to spirit ualh uplifting
and exalted lilt* patterns, but to sustain
such life patterns one needs to make a
const ions effort to understand tolerance
and thankfulness in one's dailv life, not
thoughtlessly acknowledge them
through some Gestures (or onl\ .1 limited

time each year..
I asked my friend the other day why
he was celebrating Diwali, aside from ex
plaining its significance encompassing
hope, light and thankfulness, he replied,
"more than anything else, I have grown
up doing it.'
Likewise, I feel that I have grown up
celebrating I hanksgiving and fasting
with the impression 1 hat I am being
"good." Indeed stub things are the be
ginning to a healthier lile pattern, but
this year, I just want to make myself real
ize that "good" involved a const ions pur
suit ol truth, self-control, thankfulness
and tolerant e in inv tlailv affairs —a vet )
cas\ thing to speak about in .111 op-ed but
a trying vet ti ul\ monumental com ept to
work towards.
A blunt and undeniable illustration of
much I.it k ol thankfulness is manifested
in 11 it* attitude toward food in the dining
halls. All int ret libit* amount o I'food is not
eaten and wasted thrown awa\ b\ peo
ple who determine they happened to
take too inut h (as usual) or didn't bother
to taste a foot I item. And I am one ol
those ver\ people. 1 'his simple lack t>lap
pift iation lor food 011 a tlaih basis, a sim
ple wastage to prevent, defies both
I hanksgi\ing and Ramadan.
111 the case of Ramadan, I do not see
mam people I know practicing the sell

control .tiid benevolence Iluit they do
(lining this month throughout the year
with snt I) lervor. Why not?
I want to give these age-old social and
religions const nuts m\ own meaning l>\
conveying a message to mysell and <»tll-
- and not by simply symbolically rep
resenting, or even preat lung to people,
but simply asking \on to ask voursell
what thankihlness and tolerance means
to \ou and trying to understand the ful
fillment in understanding and applet i
ating life within and without. In these
times t>l'heightened religious and social
festivities, I do not feel its necessary to
give anymore iinport.uue to turkeys
and Mindly lasting in m\ lite, though I
will do it for im traditional psychologi
cal comfort.
I am not belittling the important e of a
signilit .mt religious month for main and
.i liolida\ when families get together, and
above all, experience great physical and
spiritual unity — I just would not like it
to be .m ephemeral unit\ with one's spir
it u.ilitv and with human empathy, for me
or lor anyone else, and such pei in.nieni e
entails questioning and pursuing the rea
sons for cultural / religious constructs
rather than the symbols themselves.
