Mac Donald a 'skilled, dedicated, in
formed' leader
I have been a close friend of Andrew
Mac Donald since Kail quarter 1 ( .) ( .)S. I
write I his response to I he Daih art icle of
Oil. 2 not to att.u k the Asian-American
Student Association, hui to defend a man
who has been misundct stood and unlairl)
judged for some time. 1 fe has earned im
trust and respect man) times over, and 1
wish to convc) the- positive side of his stor\
that the pre\ ions at tic le overlooked.
M.u Donald is a skilled, dedicated, in
formed and caring leader. Hut even great
leaders can not effective!) function in the
teeth of internal opposition and resent
ment. I lie Stanford community may
hlamc Mac Donald for this controversy
and consider his resignation as a defeat,
hut that is a skewed perspective. Me
showed great moral courage trying to per
form his duties as c hair amidst the lieaw
skepticism and scrutiny that routinely
hounded him.
I am not an expert on the facts sur
rounding Mac Donald's abridged term as
AASA (.hair and his recent decision to step
down. But I know that he had diverse and
broad goals for the future of the AASA or
ganization. Kvcn il they were not feasible
or beneficial in his critics' opinions, there is
no doubt in my mind that he was, and will
continue to be, a faithful advocate to the
betterment of the Asian-American com
munity at Stanford.
I know that I can not speak lot tlu" en
tire Asian-Americ an community at Stan
ford. but I did not consider Mac Donald's
elec lion as a blow to Asian-American polit
ic al empowerment, as some have claimed.
I he shameful blow to empowerment was
the lad that he ran unopposed. I low can

AASA claim that Mac Donald was not a
suitable candidate for the position and
then seek out a supposeclh superior re
placement who did not even lake" a stand
iu the original election?
Although I never doubted Mac Don
ald's potential to be a good AASA ('.hair,
even I did not expect him lo win on ac -
(ount of his rate. Nevertheless, the under
dog newcomer with little- internal support
did emerge from the election victorious.
I le attempted to the best of his abilit\ to be
an effective ( hair, but was impeded b\
overwhelming disapproval. Kvcn though
he resigned in the end, lie took bold ac tion
for something he left passionatel) for, and
made his mark on this campus. I lis story
has garnered my sympathy as well as my
admiration. Mac Donald's efforts were a
fine example to AASA of what empower
ment really means.

Playboy should be housed in
physics library
With regard to the article in l ues
clay's edition. 'Playboys stolen front
(Ireen', I have a suggestion for dealing
with the disappearing magazines. I lie
University's subscription to Playboy
should be transferred to the Hubert
Refiner Memorial Library in the Ap
plied Physics building.
I here are several obvious reasons for
the change. I lie typical "Playboy" thief
probably was once a rule-obeying yet
bashful reader at (ireen, someone
hunched over a table with a barely
cracked-open magazine obscuring their
face, which would turn a shade ol red

every time someone walked past. Km
barassment never would have driven this
person lo steal il he or she had been lead
ing at I lellncr. 1 his library li.is a very low
level ol trallic and permits hours .it a time
of perusal without intrusion.
Also, unlike Green's collection,
Hellner is unlocked and unsupervised.
Hellner's patrons have demonstrated
that they can be trusted with many ex
pensive volumes lelt in the open, so I
don't see any reason why their charac
ter would break just because someone
threw one popular glossy in the mix.
Also, il student majors are required
to have breadth, then libraries ought to
Ik- as well. I hough I can think of some
tenuous connections between the sub
ject matter ol "Playboy" and applied
physics, I'm still pretty sure that "Play
boy' would help Refiner big time on
ibis one. I'm sure everyone agrees with
me by now. Ihe University libraries
should take advantage ol 11lis simple
way to keep providing a variety of peri
odicals to the Stanford community.

Bush decision runs counter to Constitution
On I uesday, President Hush granted
himself the power to order military trials

pesky concepts of the jury trial and checks
and balances are obstacles to swift justice.
