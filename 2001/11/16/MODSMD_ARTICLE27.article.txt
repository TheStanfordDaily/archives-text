Tonight: No. 3 Stanford at
Arizona State, 7 p.m., Tempe,
Ariz.
Tomorrow: No. 3 Stanford
at No. 4 Arizona, 7 p.m., Tuc
son, Ariz.

I In- win put (Ik- Cardinal
(23-2, 14-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) a game ahead of the 110-
jans (18-3, 12-2) at the top of the
Pac-10 with just three confer
ence matches to go.
But come Monda\. the cele
brations were over.
Stanford has known all week
long that to earn its ninth Pac-10
title this weekend, it would have
to do the one thing I SC.
couldn't — heat No. 112 Arizona
118-3, 13-3) in I ucson.
I he Cardinal will get its shot
at the Wildcats toinot row after

traveling to Phoenix tonight to
face Ai i/<>na State (tS-14, 11).
I he Sun Devils have had a
fairl) forgettable season, but
ASI still boasts the top dig
ging team in the conference,
whit h always makes fora po
tential upset.
I lie Sun Devils are averaging
17.7f> digs per game to Stan
ford's 14.12. ASU outside hitter
|ami ('.oughlin leads the confer
ence with 3.9f> digs per game,
which puts her just ahead of
Cardinal junior outside hittet
l.ogan loin, who leads Stanford
with 3.49.
" They're going to be in the
spoiler mood," said Stanford
head coach |ohn Dunning. "We
believe that if you match your
opponent's energy, then you
have a chance to beat them and
we expect them to have a lot of
energy. They're a good digging
team and if you can match a
team dig for dig, you'll keep
your energy up."
But the bigger threat of
the weekend really comes
from Arizona.
After suffering losses on the
road earl\ in the season to I S(
No. 12 I CIA, and Stanford —a five-game thriller in
Maples on ()(i. 7 thai essentially eliminated Arizona
Ironi the Pat -10 rate — the Wildcats have improved
substantially in the second half of the season.
Arizona is riding a 10-matt li winning streak, and
w nli bat k-to-l),i< k sweeps over I S('. and I (lIA three
weeks ago the Wildt ats extended their home winning
streak to IS matches.
"Maying .it home is a remedy fora lot ol things,"
s.iid Ai izona head (oat li I )ave Kubio. "()ur consisten
t \ has been iniit li improved .it home. We have good
size, sooni front row match-upsare good. We have to
be able to pass well with Stanford's tough serving."
I he Wildcats are second in the conference in
kills with I 7 per game, and Arizona has four
players among the top seven in hitting percentage
in the t onlerent e.
but a strong serving pcrfbrmaiue In the (Cardinal
<(>ul<l slow the ( .its' offense signifitantly and allow
Stanford to gel its blot k. averaging a conference-best
blot ks pet game, into the match.
I low we blot k ibis matt h will be very important,
.md sei \ ing and blot king lend to go hand in hand,"
Dunning s.iid. " I hex're xerx aggressive at the start of
matt lies, so it's hard to t.ike them out quickly. We'll
look to wear them down. bet ause starting last is sort
o! their trademark."
I he Wiltlt ats w ill need to come up with a way
to slow Stanford's offense il Arizona has any
