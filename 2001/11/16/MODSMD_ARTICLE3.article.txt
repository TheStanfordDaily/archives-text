# One more Big Game, one Moore surprise
## 
### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
From wacky plays to future NFL
superstars, the Big Game has al
ways produced the unexpected. In
the immortal words of Yogi Berra,
the Big Game has always reminded
Bay Area sports fan that "it ain't
over 'till it's over."
In recent years, the Big Game
has been characterized by improb
able heroes. Three years ago, it was
Stanford's F.mory Brock. I'wo
years ago. it was Stanford's Gasey
Moore, who ran 96 yards into the
end /one to give the Cardinal a
much more comfortable 15-point
leaden route to the Rose Bowl. Last
year, Moore again was the hero,
catching a touchdown pass in the
Big Game's first overtime.
Though Stanford is a 24-point
favorite, and deservedly so, (Califor
nia is a team so bad that they are
scary. ()ne < >nly needs to remember
1980 and 1998 to know that a
hugely favored squad easily be
upset during the Big Game.

game close in order to give Beat s
coach Tom I lolmoe his first — and
probably last — Big Game victory,

here are some unrecognized play

the limelight.
Since the Big C iame never seems

Brian -Mien will probablv be in the
"play* that defines to 2001 Big

last three games, here are some un

who may grab the limelight.

here are some unrecognized play

the limelight.
Since the Big C iame never seems
to follow am suit, (California's Kyle

last three games, here are some un

who may grab the limelight.
Cal's Candidates
Backup quarterback Eric Holt

Boiler suffers an injury or is
benched due to his ineptitude, se

the chance to shine in his final Big

UCLA earlier this year, I loltfreter
completed 1 I of 29 passes for 102
yards and showed some ui< e touch
on a couple of throws.
Running back Terrell Williams:
In place of the injured Joe Igber,
the freshman has rushed for 275
yards in his List three panics.
Wide receiver LaShaun Ward: \
