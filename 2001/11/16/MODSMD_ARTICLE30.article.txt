No one would ever tell a first-time driver
to step on it and hit the highway.
At night.
With a stick-shift cur.
Kut that's essentially what the men's bus
kcthull team is being forced to do In travel
ing to New Mexico this weekend.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Tomorrow: No. 1 3 Stanford at New
Mexico, 6 p.m., Albuquerque, N.M.

(>n Saturday, the voting Cardinal will get
behind the wheel lot the first time this season
in a hostile arena, where it will face a I.ohos
team that is aching to avenge an embarrass
ing 75-44 loss from last season.
Up to 18.01 »S st reaming fans at "The Pit"
will also be hoping to make No. 13 Stanford
regret opening its season on the road for the
first time since 1979. I he Cardinal will be
playing in the state of New Mexico for the
first time in its <S(i-vcar history.
" 1 hat is notorious as one of the toughest
places in the country to play, said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "What you don't
know is how (the players] are going to react
to adversity and how that affects our ability to
stay together and stay tough — those are the
kinds of things we have to answer."
If Montgomery and his players wanted an
early test, they sure got it.
"I think we would be better suited to have
a game or two under our belt before we went
to this part it ular game, but that's just not the
way the schedule fell," Montgomery said.
Of course, when New Mexico was bt>oked
two years ago, Montgomery anticipated that
now-NBA professional Jason Collins would

still be at Stanford.
I he I .ohos, coat lied by third-veai coach
Fran Traschilla, are led by Ruben Douglas.
Kt it (Chatfield and Marlon Palmer. All three
are returning guards, and interesting!)
enough, they are all expected to start.
Douglas, a 0-foot-f junior, led all I .ohos
guards last year with points and 5.8 re
hounds per game. Palmer, who is expected
to play point guard most of the night, and
(Chatfield both contributed more than II
points per contest as well last year.
With a three-guard offense. New Mexico
is sure to run the hall at the (Cardinal and also
depend on the three-point shot.
"They play a style that is very aggressive
and very quick, with some realK good guys
off the bench," Montgomery said. " That's a
test for anyone, regardless."
Therefore, although freshman Josh (Chil
dress started the first two games in favor of
junior Julius Barnes, it would not be surpris
ing to see Barnes start or come off the bent h
early to control the Lobos' speed.
I he (Cardinal will also be somewhat famil
iar with a fourth Lobos guard, junior transfer
Scnque Carey of Last Palo Alto, who played
against Stanford two years ago as a Washing
ton I fusky. (Carey sat out last year and is now
eligible to play.
Although New Mexico has speed, it lacks
si/e in its starting lineup. Sophomore for
ward Alvin Broussard is only 0-0 and sopho
more tenter Patrick Dennehy is 0-9.
Therefore, junior 7-0 center (Cutlis Bor
t hardt and sophomores Justin Davis and Joe
Kirchofer must help Stanford take advan
tage inside the key.
"It's going to be really tough," said point
guurd lony (iiovacthini. "Basically, we're
being thrown tight into the fire."
Game time will be at 0 p.m.
