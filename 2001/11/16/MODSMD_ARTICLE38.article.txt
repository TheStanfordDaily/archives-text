# Despite the hype, Kyle Boller's no baller

### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
In 1999, loin Holmoe's third
year as California's head football
coach, his future in Berkeley began
to look up.
1 hat was the year that quarter
back recruit extraordinaire, Kyle
Boiler, became a (iolden Bear.
Despite playing just one year as
quarterback at Hart High in the
San Fernando Valley — the same
school that produced Stanford's
current third-string quarterback,
freshman Kyle Matter— Boiler es
tablished himself as one of the na
tion's top prep quarterbacks. An
All-American and consensus top
five recruit, Boiler chose Berkele\
over storied quarterback factories
like Florida State, Tennessee and
I'enn State.
Yet in the three seasons that
Boiler has donned the blue and
gold, Holtnoe has won just seven
games. And as goes Boiler's colosal
l\ disappointing play, so goes I lol
moe's career at Berkeley.
Holmoe resigned as the Bear's
coach on Nov. 3 under pressure
from the press and alumni in the
midst of a winless season. ()ne can

not help but wonder that if Boiler
had exhibited just a fraction of'the
potential indicated by the hype,
Holmoe might have been able to
dodge the unemployment line.
But much ol the blame must rest
on Holmoe as well. Desperate to
push the Golden Bears out of a
years-long rut, Holmoe pinned
C -ill's hopes on Boiler almost imme
diateh after he set loot in Memorial
Stadium.
Just three games into his first
year, Boiler was thrust into the
starting lineup, snatching the posi

true freshman. Boiler donned the
heaviest shoulder pads of all, faced
with the task of resurrecting what
had become a perennial loser.

With no wins in nine tries this season, and none in four Big Games against
Stanford, Cal coach Tom Holmoe, who resigned Nov. 3, is probably lament

Kyle Boiler was supposed to be Col's savior when he started as a true fresh
man two years ago. But, after a leading the Bears to a winless season, his
fortunes have dropped as low as Cal coach Tom Holmoe's.

do it again, I probably rather
would have redshirted, lilted,
got big. doming out as a senior
in high si hool you think you tan

Boiler struggled with his accura
cy for the entire season, and fin
ished 1 ( .)99 with nine touchdowns
to go with l.~> interceptions and a
passing percentage.
He ste.ulilv improved as the
team s starter throughout 2000,
and his numbers were dramatically
better, \et his squad finished H-8.
At the outset of this season,
both dais coaches and Boiler
thought tliev were finally onto
something special.
"We were real confident back
then," Boiler said. "We thought
coming into the Illinois game
that we were just going to walk .ill
over them."
I he lllini trounced dal 44-17

just 184 yards vs it h one interception
and no touchdowns. I 'hat started
the season which w ill live in (>olden
Bear infamy.
In the eight losses following
that fateful season opener. Boiler
has suffered immensely, both
physically and mentally. A back
injim sidelined the signal caller
for two games, and he has been
repeatedly benched in favor of
bat knps Reggie Robertson and
Eric I foilfreder.
One wacky play in dais 48-7
loss to Oregon earlier this year
sums up Boiler's unfortunate c «i

mediatclv snatched from the air.
As Boiler tucked the ball to run, an
Oregon lineman forced the quar
terback to fumble. Boiler recov
ered the bouncing ball and gained
two yards.
A frustrating play in a frustrat

somebody to do something when

Kyle Boiler was supposed to be Col's savior when he started as a true fresh
man two years ago. But, after a leading the Bears to a winless season, his
fortunes have dropped as low as Cal coach Tom Holmoe's.

do it again, I probably rather
would have redshirted, lilted,
got big. doming out as a senior
in high si hool you think you tan
do anything."
Boiler struggled with his accura
cy for the entire season, and fin
ished 1 ( .)99 with nine touchdowns
to go with l.~> interceptions and a
passing percentage.
He ste.ulilv improved as the
team s starter throughout 2000,
and his numbers were dramatically
better, \et his squad finished H-8.
At the outset of this season,
both dais coaches and Boiler
thought tliev were finally onto
something special.
"We were real confident back
then," Boiler said. "We thought
coming into the Illinois game
that we were just going to walk .ill
over them."

Bear infamy.
In the eight losses following
that fateful season opener. Boiler
has suffered immensely, both
physically and mentally. A back
injim sidelined the signal caller
for two games, and he has been
repeatedly benched in favor of
bat knps Reggie Robertson and
Eric I foilfreder.
One wacky play in dais 48-7
loss to Oregon earlier this year
sums up Boiler's unfortunate c «i

As Boiler tucked the ball to run, an
Oregon lineman forced the quar
terback to fumble. Boiler recov
ered the bouncing ball and gained
two yards.
A frustrating play in a frustrat
ing season.
"It's hard to be a leader when
you're not winning, Boiler said.
"How do vou have a right to tell
somebody to do something when
you're not doing it yourself?"
