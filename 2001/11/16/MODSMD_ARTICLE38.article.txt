# Despite the hype, Kyle Boller's no baller

### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
In 1999, loin Holmoe's third
year as California's head football
coach, his future in Berkeley began
to look up.
1 hat was the year that quarter
back recruit extraordinaire, Kyle
Boiler, became a (iolden Bear.
Despite playing just one year as
quarterback at Hart High in the
San Fernando Valley — the same
school that produced Stanford's
current third-string quarterback,
freshman Kyle Matter— Boiler es
tablished himself as one of the na
tion's top prep quarterbacks. An
All-American and consensus top
five recruit, Boiler chose Berkele\
over storied quarterback factories
like Florida State, Tennessee and
I'enn State.
Yet in the three seasons that
Boiler has donned the blue and
gold, Holtnoe has won just seven
games. And as goes Boiler's colosal
l\ disappointing play, so goes I lol
moe's career at Berkeley.
Holmoe resigned as the Bear's
coach on Nov. 3 under pressure
from the press and alumni in the
midst of a winless season. ()ne can

not help but wonder that if Boiler
had exhibited just a fraction of'the
potential indicated by the hype,
Holmoe might have been able to
dodge the unemployment line.
But much ol the blame must rest
on Holmoe as well. Desperate to
push the Golden Bears out of a
years-long rut, Holmoe pinned
C -ill's hopes on Boiler almost imme
diateh after he set loot in Memorial
Stadium.
Just three games into his first
year, Boiler was thrust into the
starting lineup, snatching the posi
tion from sophomore Sam
( '.lemons. As a barely 18-year-old
true freshman. Boiler donned the
heaviest shoulder pads of all, faced
with the task of resurrecting what
had become a perennial loser.
1 le won his first game, passing
for 217 yards and two touch
downs in Gal's 24-23 victory over
Arizona State.
But as brilliant as I lolmoe's trust
in the phenom seemed them, now it
appears to have been a premature
move.

With no wins in nine tries this season, and none in four Big Games against
Stanford, Cal coach Tom Holmoe, who resigned Nov. 3, is probably lament
ing his decision to stick with quarterback Kyle Boiler so early in his career.


LAN BUCHANAN/The Daily Californian
Kyle Boiler was supposed to be Col's savior when he started as a true fresh
man two years ago. But, after a leading the Bears to a winless season, his
fortunes have dropped as low as Cal coach Tom Holmoe's.
