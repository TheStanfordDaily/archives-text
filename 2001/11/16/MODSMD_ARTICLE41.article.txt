# Rivalry weak, but still Screecherific

### 
To he completely honest, I'm torn
down the middle with this whole "Big
(ianic" thing. On one hand, I really
don't like the contrived nature of the

riVilli \ Ihe ridii ulonsly dorky
( hauls and the hissing whenev
er the word "( al" is heard. I lie
forced and .n tili( lal hatred lor
oni neighboi up the Hay, espe
cial!) when it conies from stu
dcnls that have heen here less
ill.in two months.
As lar as il goes lor me, I
couldn't give a 11ap about (..il

— and that's not jusi bee .uisc they suck at loot
hall and should prohahlv be plaving down the
road against Pah High instead of at Stanford
Stadium, I oeing the line ol extreme arro
gance, when vou show that you're better in all
facets of a univcrsih — at ademit ally,. il 11 let it al
ly and so forth — any contempt on your part is
not only uncalled lor, but downright stupid.
Instead, I get more fired up when .1 team
like I (lIA comes tip fora Pat-10 showdown,
with a I leisman < andidatc in the I>;u kfieltl and
national t hainpionship hopes 011 the line. ()r
when tlit- \ri/ona Wildcats play their annual
game at Maples, a game tlestinetl to go d<>wti to
the wire ami one tli.it alwavs allcds the N( AA

tournament seetlings. I'o me, that's where the
real intensity tomes from.
Now that I've pretty much bashed the Big
(lame and anyone that's excited for it, I've got
to be the weasel that switches sides.
first of all, anyone with a deep appreciation
and love for sports — whether it's college or pro
fessional — must respect history. And as laras ri
valries go, nowhere in college football is history
stronger and more storied than Stanlbrd-( lal.
It's the oldest rivalry on the West (loast and
the games themselves have often been down
right spectacular — and I mean more than just
"The I'lay" in 1982. I lie Big Game has been
won live times 011 the final play, and a ridicu
lous 49 of the I 03 Big (lames have been decid
ed In a tout hdown or less. I be rivalry has been
so close over the years that if you add up all of
the stores 112 rom the lOS contests, only 141
points separate the two teams. In this case, the
numbers don't lie.
Second, the Axe itself is t 001. It's the epito
me of bragging rights, passed down from year
to year, generation to generation. Ihe fact
that the governor ol (California used to award
the Axe to the winning team early 011 in the ri
valry shows just how big of a plat e the rivalry,
and the Axe in particular, have in college
lootball folklore.

Also, all of the stories about students going
on clandestine missions to steal the Axe are
straight up hilarious. I hey're right out of
Saved By The Bell and all of the Bayside-\ alley
fiascos. In my book, anything that reminds you
of Saved Bv I he Bell lias got to be ok, so I guess
I i an let a couple other iliiugs slide.
My only problem is that I come from a
school of thought where true rivalries make
themselves happen. I hev don't need to be con
trived or prodded in every possible way.
In the NBA, the Knit ks and the I leat duke
it out every time thev play not because the ri
valry has been going on for dec ades (it hasn't)
or because they get some ancient piece of
hardware lor winning (tlicv don't). I liev bat
tle time .md time again because they genuine
ly dislike eat li other, and the mutual animosi
ty manifests itself on the court m the lorm of
hard-fought, Unbelievably (lose, defensive
masterpieces.
For me, the Big (lame should appear some
where along the continuum between the wa\ it
is now and the way the knic ks I leat games go.
II voii just step back and let the chips fall w here
they ma\, the intensity will show up on its own,
assuming it really is such an intense rivalr\ You
don't have to force it. II it's meant to happen,
it'll happen.

Redshirt freshman wide receiver Teyo Johnson, who leads the Cardinal with
29 receptions, figures to be a target of the Cal defense in the 104 th Big
Game. If so, expect one of Stanford's gaggle of tight ends to step up.
