There is nothing wrong with
wanting your body to be
healthy and in shape, but it your
whole life is tocused on losing
weight, you may be suffering
from an eating disorder.
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are
the two major types of eating
disorders. While they affect only
3-5% of the population, the
incidence is much higher among
adolescent and young women.
Anorexia
Sufferers from anorexia are
driven bv a compulsive desire
to lose weight. They severely
limit their intake of calories,
and get to a point of dangerous
thinness. Thev are also prone to
menstrua t i on abnorma I i t i es
brought about by an inadequate
intake of calories. An anorexic
person may:
■ Severely limit or refuse food
■ Have great fear of gaining
weight
■ Be preoccupied with food
■ Deny seriousness of low
weight
■ Exercise excessively
Bulimia
With bulimia, a person engages in
binge eating, or eats an unusually
large amount of food in one
sitting. Some anorexics also
engage in binge eating and
purging. Bulimic people often
experience a lack of control over
what or how much they eat
during these binges, which may
be triggered by emotional upset or
bo axiom.
To prevent weight gain, some
sufferers of bulimia purge by
making themselves throw up,
using medications such as
laxatives, fasting, or exercise.
Bulimic persons may have
normal, above normal, or under
normal weight. It is estimated
Eating Disorders were uncommon
when this picture of Stanford
students living in Roble Hull
was taken a century ago. Now it
is estimated that 18% of young
women may suffer from some
degree of bulimia.
that as many as 18% of female
high school and college
students may suffer from
varying degrees of bulimia.
Other symptoms of these eating
disorders include:
■ Dry skin
■ Brittle hair or hair loss
■ Dental problems such as loss
of teeth enamel
■ Swollen glands on both sides
of the jaw from vomiting
■ Depression and mood swings
■ Self-esteem overly influenced
by weight, body shape, and
appearance
■ Concealing eating and purging
from others
Physical Ailments
Hating disorders can lead to a
number of serious physical
ailments such as:
■ Weakened bones
■ Low blood pressure
■ Irregular heartbeat
■ Dehydration
■ Fatigue
Emotional Symptoms
These may include feelings of:
■ Social isolation
■ Shame
■ Depression
■ Despair
■ Loss of control
Serious
Consequences
The consequences of either type
of eating disorder can ultimately
be fatal. Some people starve
themselves to death. Others die
of a heart attack due to damage
to heart muscle or a loss of
potassium, a mineral that is
critical to maintaining the
electrical activity of the heart.
Cause
While the cause of the conditions
is unclear, eating disorders have
been predictably linked to several
things, including physiological,
emotional, social, and personality
factors. People who have eating
disorders may be depression
prone, sensitive to others' opinions
of them, dislike conflicts, and have
high expectations of themselves.
Treatment
In most cases, abnormal eating
habits can be changed, but eating
disorders require professional
treatment. Many recover success
fully through regular office visits.
A hospital stay is sometimes
required in an extreme case.
Treatment usually involves
medical monitoring, nutritional
counseling and supplements,
individual and family psycho
therapy, and sometimes medica
tions. Family support plays an
important role in any successful
treatment program.
