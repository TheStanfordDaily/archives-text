U
Bush has moved methodically in at
tacking Afghanistan. The careful pace
of the war on terrorism reflects Con
doleezza Rice's approach to problem
solving, close observers said...
'The highly deliberate, unflappable
quality of the campaign so far; the
fact that it's unfolding in almost
clocklike fashion, is consistent with
how I would expect Condi to do this,'
said Coit'Chip' Blacker.; director of
Stanford's Institute for International
Studies and a close friend of Rice.
There also was great symbolism in
the White House decision to have a
black woman explain U.S. policies to a
skeptical Arab world.
k She is everything the Taliban does
not like: She's female, she's arguably
at this moment in time the most pow
erful woman in the world, and she's
the antithesis of everything they stand
for,' Blacker said. And she's an
African-American. So there's a kind
of double-barreled message here. This
is what progressive societies produce
in terms of their women.' A A
