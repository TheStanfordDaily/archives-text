# With sperm ad comes controversy
## $15,000 offer limited to attractive Caucasians with blue eyes

"Stanford student wanted for spem
donor. SI 5k offered. Intelligent, good
looking, over 6ft. tall. No history of self
or family addictions."
This is not the sort of advertise
ment that readers usually expect to
find in the Palo Alto Daily News
classified section. Yet just such an
ad has appeared there for the past
two weeks, placed by a Burlingame
woman who hopes to find a sperm
donor in order to have a child.
The 33-year-old woman, who
wishes to remain anonymous, ex
plained that she specifically wants
a Stanford student because she as
sumes that the donor will have a
high level of intelligence. As for
her other requirements, she said
she will decide when she meets
the donor.
"Intellect is a given if they go
to Stanford," she said. "And if 1
meet them and I like them, I'll
choose them."
The woman said her unconven
tional approach to having a child
stems from her frustration with t he
dating scene.
"I'm planning on waiting anoth
er year until my 34th birthday, and
if my dating situation doesn't get
any better, then I will go the artifi
cial insemination route," she said.
The divorcee said she feels like she
is running out of time to have a
child, but eventually hopes to be re
married and provide a father for
her child.
As for her criteria, she asks
that they be Caucasian, tall, at
tractive and have blue eyes to
match her own.
"My intuition about the donor is
very important," she said. "I will
make a judgment on whether or
not I like [his] personality. I'm not
trying to choose a husband for my
self, I just have to feel that they are
a good person and will provide my

child with the Ix'st genes and best
chances for success."
She justifies her criteria by say
ing, "It is the only tangible thing
that I have control over, and 1 want
to do it light."
Reaction on campus lias been
varied. With some students strong
ly opposed and others racing to
sign up, the advertisement has
sparked a debate alxiut the ethical
implications of the ad.
Bioethics lecturer William Hurl
but cautioned against taking the
matter lightlv.
"I think we should be very
careful not to let new reproduc
tive technologies lead us to a
purely instrumental view of de
veloping life," lie said.
Hurlbut stressed the need for
prospective sperm donors to weigh
the consequences of their actions
and reali/e that they will be a bio
logical father of a child.
"At this stage in students' lives,
$15,000 is almost undue influence,
and it's hard to realize the future
consequences of doing something
like this," he said. "Among other
things, a donor needs to consider
what it would be like to have a son
or daughter out there in the world
who might look like them, and with
whom they might feel some life
connection, but have no personal
or legal relationship."
The $ 15,000 rate is unusual fora
single sperm donation, making the
going rate for donations at sperm
banks pale in comparison. The Cal
ifornia Ciyobank, located in the
Stanford Barn just a short walk
away from the center of campus,
pays its donors $50 a donation, two
to three times per week, with a min
imum commitment of six months.
A Stanford sophomore athlete,
who asked to remain anonymous,
said he was thrilled when lie heard
about the woman's offer. Since lie is
already a donor to the Cryobank,
the offer seemed even sweeter than
his current situation.
The student said he became in
volved in the program by respond
ing to an ad placed in The Daily.
"I called, not knowing what to
expect," he said. " The only thing

that the acl said was, 'Want extra
cash? Earn up to $600a month with
minimal time commitment,' so I
called and found out what it was
about. My thoughts were: If I'm
going to do it anyway, I might as
well get paid."
He didn't have any ethical
doubts about donating sperm.
"I don't have a problem with it,"
lie said. "'llie extra money is good,
and it's nice to think that I'm help
ing out couples who aren't able to
have children."
Other students did not feel the
same sense of ease about the issue.
"I wouldn't do it," saicl junior
Matt Stenerson. "It just doesn't
seem right."
Other guys simply had their
price.
Junior Chris Christensen said,
"Of course I'd do it, 1 think that it
would only take about $1,000, pro
vided that the child was raised well."
Sophomore Orion Courtin, a
peer health educator, said he was
worried about the emotional well
being of the t hild.
"There aren't any guarantees
when you have a child," Courtin
said. "People don't understand
enough about genetics to see that
this child isn't necessary going to be
intelligent, tall and attractive. It is
unreasonable to set such high ex
pectations fora child. I think that
their sense of self will be distorted,
especially when they are supposed
to posses the 'best' genes," he said.
Still, Courtin admitted, "For
$15,000 I'd definitely do it."
Despite the varied views on the
issue, about one percent of births in
the United States are through arti
ficial insemination, and the practice
is commonplace in fertility clinics
across the country. It is increasingly
becoming an option for couples
who can't have children and lor sin
gle women who want children of
their own.
1 he woman placing the ad says
she desperately wants a child and
has wanted to have children all
her life.
"No matter what happens, my
