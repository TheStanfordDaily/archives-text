# Anxiety, stress linger after attacks
## 
### KRISTEN BELL 
In the more than two months since the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 1 1 brought America to a standstill,
the acute effects of the tragedy have faded, but
counselors, psychiatrists and students say that the
underlying impact remains and continues to exert
its presence on the campus.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, director of Counseling
and Psychological Services at Cowell Student
Health Center, said the attacks made people real
ize that "we're not as protected as we thought we
were — we used to see terrorism as something that
only happened abroad and [we thought] that
America was safe."
Stress and anxiety about the attacks varies great
ly according to individual circumstances or per
sonality, Martinez said. In all cases, however, there
is a feeling of vulnerability associated with the real
ization that America is no longer invincible.
Senior Adeline Azrack of the Bridge 24-hour
counseling network agreed that there exists a di
minished sense of security.
"Our generation has grown up in a time of
such security — our biggest worries were things
like 'What if 1 don't get in to med school?' "
Azrack said. "Now we are dealing with something
completely different."
Although most students do not feel a sense of
imminent danger, Martinez said the new possi
ble dangers make people anxious. Counselors
and officials s.iv an increased understanding of
emergency protocol is an effective way to de
crease such anxiety.
"Safety measures are very helpful . . . knowing
where to turn to and who to call in the event of an
emergency helps recover a sense of security," said
Shawn O'Rierdan, a counselor at the Stanford
Help Center for employees.
Stanford I'olic e (Ihief Marvin Moore noted that
we live with a certain amount of risk every day.
"Although we can't eliminate risk, we can re
spond to it effectively, and an effective response
helps people feel more secure.'' Moore said. He
said he is confident in Stanford's emergency
preparations and lie assured students tli.it they are
"just as safe now as thev were on Sept. 10."
Most students who were not directly affected
said tlicv feel little or no anxiety in relation to the
attacks. Main said thev simplv do not have time to
think about the tragedy because they are so busy
with schoolwork.
"The mourning process was unnaturally shut
down by necessity with the fast-paced, focused life
here at Stanford," Azrack said.
While Stanford's somewhat sheltered environ
ment may disturb some, it provides a sense of se

curity for others, who said they believe "ignorance
is bliss."
"I don't know what is going on at all, and to be
perfectly honest, 1 like it that way, said freshman
Sara Ines Calder6n. " I his isolationism is m\ secu
rity blanket."
For those students who were direct In alfected,
stress over the tragedy manifests itsell in 111 am dit
ferent fashions, including di(Ticult\ sleeping,
mood swings, loss of appetite and reluctant e to ex
press feelings, counselors explained. HoNvever.
most students seem to be experiencing anxietN
much more indirectly.
Representatives from both Cowell and 11 u*
Bridge have noted a distinct increase 111 people
coming in for counseling, but very tew, it am. of
these students came to specifically discuss feelings
about terrorism. At the Bridge's workshop dealing
with anxiety after the attacks, attendance Nvas zero.
"It's really fascinating that no one wants to t;ilk
about it." A/rack said. However, she s.iid that
once students come in for counseling, 1 licn usual
ly end up discussing the events of Sept. 1 1 and
their impact.
A/racks suggested that worries about the at tat ks
are manifesting themselves indirecth in what one
student termed "an unconscious undercurrent" of
self-doubt, depression, homesickness, exhaustion,
loneliness and other dillit ulties.
According to counselors, the most important
method of coping with anxiety about terrorist .it
tacks is to talk about it.
"As painful as it may seem, we cannot heal until
we start talking about it," A/rack said, emphasizing
the importance of"being gentle with ourselves, . . .
[not] denying your feelings . . . and [giving] your
self permission to be frustrated."
Counselors seemed to agree that healing time
varies greatly from person to person. Martinez said
Stanford students will generalh heal more <)iiii kl\
than students on the East Coast.
"The closer you are to a situation, the more vou
will be affected," he said. C )n the West ('.oast, both
time and distance serve as buffers that limit grief,
making it less urgent and hastening healing time.
Martinez, also said students continue to be af
fected by events subsequent to Sept. I 1, espet I.il
ly those with family in the military or those of \i a
bic origin.
Many students commented that current events
relating to the U.S. government's handling of the
situation at home and abroad worry them more
than the events of two months ago.
"What worries me most about terrorism is the
tendency people have to freak out and blame any
one that 'looks' like a terrorist and react in inhu
man ways," Calderon said.
