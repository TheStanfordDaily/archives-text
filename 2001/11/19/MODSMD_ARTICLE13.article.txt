## The
						Stanford Daily Foothill land needs should be seen from all angles

Published Since JS9I

At a meeting last week, community
members discussed the placement
o! two trails ih.it Stanford is re
quired to dedicate lor public use
under the General Use Permit. In less than
a month, the University must submit the
final routes tor the trails, giving the matter
a new urgency.
Ihe GUI' — the agreement between
Stanford and Santa Glara Gounty allowing
the University to build approximately two
million square feet of academic buildings
and 3,000 housing units over the next 10
years — does not stipulate the exact align
ment of the paved biking / hiking trails.
Stanford has put forth two potential
alignments of the G1 trail (San Francisquito
/ Los Francos Greeks Gonnector Frail) and
SI trail (Matadero Greek/ Page Mill Sub
regional Frail).

Flic debate has been particularly heated
because the trails will become government
property, dedicated to Santa Glara Gounty
in perpetuity. Stanford wants the trails to
placed on the edge ol the property so Uni
versity land will be maintained for Univer
sity purposes, a logical desire.
I he Stanford administration is in charge
of an institution th.it will last lor centuries.
Its decisions must be made with an eye to
wards the unknown, and it must protect its
land for the future, lb allow deep, invasive
trails through the Foothills and through
parts of campus could possibly hinder the
future ol the University and prevent to
morrow's administration from having free
dom over its land, lb give land away forev
er is a major decision I hat deserves every bit
<>112 time this issue has been given.
Six environmental groups have joined

together to protest Stanford's proposal,
claiming that the trails are insensitive to the
habitat of the red-legged frogs and will
pose safety risks.
I lowever, the University has proven to be
proactive regarding environmental matters
and deserves credit for protecting the
Foothills. Because the Foothills were being
destroyed by too many visitors and clogs
roaming through the land, the University
c reated a paved path for community mem
bers to use and prohibited dogs, thereby al
lowing access to the hills and preserving
natural life as well.
In another recent example, the Universi
ty agreed to dedicate, manage and monitor
habitat easements for the protection of the
(California tiger salamander.
Stanford's actions show an awareness of
how important the Foothills are to the sur-

rounding community. In response to con
cerns about development in the Foothills,
Stanford announced that it will set aside its
open spaces from development for 25
years. (Currently, the University maintains
a trail to the Dish that is open to the com
munity, aside from the proposed trails). In
this controversy over the trails, Stanford
has been inviting public participation in
this discussion and consulting with Santa
Clara county members, proven by last
week's meeting.
Clearly, invasive trails through the mid
dle of Stanford's land is unreasonable.
When an easement is required on a home
owner's property, it's logical and expected
for the easement to be located on the land's
edge. Stanford deserves the same consider
ation when deciding to give away land to
the county forever.
