# THAT SIDE OF PARADISE
## Behind the veil of Special Ops 
### 
If you had asked me a lew months ago
what I thought of our nation's
armed fort es. 1 probahlv would have
been dismissive and (ritual. F.vcn
alter the sensational linale ol the Persian
C * 1111 War — which I was 100 young to
grasp anyway —m\ conception ol the
military was that it was a lone ol brutish,
NRA links led by hubristic Old World
generals. A veritable Dixie Armv with au
tomatic weapons; and alar cry from the
heroic corps that my grandfather served
in during WWI I. But now, alter hours ol
scanning cnn.com and nytimes.com each
day for breaking developments in
Afghanistan, I am smitten with the I Hited
States Armed Forces.
Unsurprisingly, what is leading my

nascent admiration tor
our military is the work
of Special Operation
Units of Army Rangers
and Delta I on e soldiers
that had (Ik-ii debutante
ball in Afghanistan .1 cou
ple of weeks ago. (Grant
ed, I am singling out a
tiny, elite prong of the

military, but Spec ial ()peration forces are
the only human capital on the ground 111
Afghanistan that the public is currently
aware of, so their exploits have garnered
the focus of both the nation and me.
Just as John 1\ Kennedy restored class
to the White I louse, the recent successes
of Special Operation units in
Afghanistan have restored mvstique,
glory and gallantry to our military. With
their SWA l ish /eal and clandestine
bravado, they have re-romantic i/ed mil
itary ac tion and seem to have revamped
civilian approval.
Before, I couldn't have told you the
difference between an Army Ranger and
a Navy Seal, but now 1 know how many
millimeters wide the bullets that come
from an A(1 30 gunship are. M v friends
and I used to answer the "what would
you do it you were drafted"'" question
with the only half-jesting answer "move
to (lanada," and now I know people who
are willinglv enlisting.
Of course, it helps that the trailer the
Pentagon has released for our military'ef
fort on the ground is simply cinematic.
The footage is (llancy-esquc, replete with
night vision, and as the tape tracks Ameri
can soldiers through a speedy mid, the
viewer half expects a narrating voice-over.
It's scripted but spellbinding, and conveys
a shrouded and noble glamour not appar
ent in military efforts in mv lifetime.
Another reason for my fledgling cn
amoration with the American Special
Operation forces is that they attest to our
ability to wage a newer, more piec ise ver
sion of war. I he situation in Afghanistan
demands it. Sure, we are still dropping
thousands of tons of bombs 011 Afghan
targets, errantly destroying the occasion
al mosque, but the precision with which
Special Operation soldiers strike is a di

reel contrast to <>111 half-blind ground an
tics in Vietnam.
I hey punctuate the dynamism of our
vast ai in\ and prove that we (.111 att with
shrewd, exact measure rat bet than just
clumsily carpet bombing our way to vit to
r\ — though we havetlonea hit ol that too.
It should have always been this way.
I he Vietnam veterans who were greetetl
with witlesptead st 0111 and disgust .it their
homecoming were unwitting victims of a
bat klash that their government's slippery
polity 11fated for them. Sure, the anti-war
spectre is great lor the American democ
racy . but the lat t that I am in rentl\ daz
zled by our Armed Forces testifies to the
feebleness ol that pacifist shadow.
1 he resuscitation ol the military (and
police and firefighter) hero is a phe
nomenon that will be exploited by oppor
tunists at .ill levels ami most (onspicm>uslv.
by our president. (ieorge W. Bush's papa
lost his reelection even though even lie
won his war, and (ieorge W. will do Ins best
not make the same mistake. (ieorge W. will
tit) his best to title the patriotic, pro-war
wave to a second term, and vou can hi' sure
(hat il we are st ill in Afghanistan in a couple
of years, tactical strikes will coincide with
crucial stages of the election.
Fven though I am waxing romantic
011 our new war, certainly the last thing
that the Pentagon should do is romanti
cize the ability of covert units to light in
Afghanistan, as it has done with its green
video footage and press conference
rhetoric. Ihe current resurrection of
nationalism is <1 sweeping domestic phe
nomenon. but our soldiers are the ones
who cany the burden of imposing the
newfound American will in Afghanistan
-anti one of the greatest services that
the administration can tlt> for our sol
diers todanip the re-deification of veiled
military action.
Seymour M. I lersh reported in the
Nov. 12 Ihe New Yorker that a Delta
Force soldier remarked that the army
planners "think we can perform fucking
magic. We can't." Indeed, if there is one
entit) that should not glorify our capacity
to defeat the I aliban and al Qaetla vis a vis
Special Operations units, it is the Pen
tagon. If thousands of ground troops are
necessary to supplement Special Opera
tions forces .ind expel the I aliban from
their final stronghold, then that course of
action should be taken immediately. Viet
nam testifies to the sin of stubborn hesita
tion antl overestimation.
While the Pentagon is euphemistic or
outright reticent about the opposition that
Special Operations units have encoun
tered st> far, the little-known fact remains
that the attack on Mullah's residential
complex led to multiple Delta Force casu
alties and near catastrophe when the 1 al
iban counterattacked. Special Forces
