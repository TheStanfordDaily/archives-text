Palo Alto resident 'shocked' by Stanford
trails proposal
During the protracted light to gel its
General Use Permit approved in the
County last year, Stanford succeeded in
alienating and uniting surrounding
communities and groups as diverse as
tlog lovers and golfers. Nevertheless,
they were able to rain their plan largely
intact through Santa Clara County
politicians, the majority of whom
seemed indifferent to the needs and tie
sires of their Northern County con
stituents. It was frustrating to attend
public meetings and watt h the supervi
sors daydreaming, sleeping or asking
off-point questions. I remember feeling
that the public process seemed a bit of a
charade as Stanford's power politics
prevailed.
At the end of the GUP process, Stan
ford acknowledged its missteps with the
community antl vowed to mend relation
ships. I half expected them to volunteer
some concessions, if only to ask for more
favors from the County later. For this
reason, I was shocked w hen they recent
ly submitted their trails plan, which was
required as part of the GUP approval.
Rather than working together with
surrounding communities or interest
groups to jointly develop a workable

plan, Stanford submitted a proposal that
could only be interpreted as a slap in the
face to its neighbors. The fact that six di
verse non-profit groups immediately co
alesced to fight Stanford's cynical pro
posal is testament to Stanford's unique
ability to act like the island kingdom it
perceives itself to be.
Stanford's trails proposal is so far
from complying with the Countywide
I rails Master I'lan (a requirement), that
it is unlikely to be approved — even by
daydreaming politicians and over
worked county staffers. There are many
workable alternatives to Stanford's plan,
and .ill interested parties should work
diligently towards a solution that meets
our collective interests.
Maybe Stanford officials were taking
cues from Microsoft, who recently
showed that starting high and digging in
often works in protracted political bat
tles. While Microsoft has a captive con
sumer base and is more interested in in
vestor feedback than customer relations,
Stanford should realize that having a
good relationship with its neighbors is
now an essential part of its self-determi
nation. As soon as Stanford recognizes
this, maybe they will stop their assault.
