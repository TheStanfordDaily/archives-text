ANov. 10 story, "Med St lioolgratl joins
sex discrimination suit," contained a num
ber of significant factual errors.
Contrary to (lie implication in the
headline and the statement in the lead
paragraph, the American Association ol
University Women's Legal Advocat \
Fund has not tiled a sexual clist riinination
lawsuit against Stanford.
Instead, 1996 Medical St hool graduate
Barbara Albert is the individual plaiiitill
ola lawsuit filed against the I niversitv.
Because of a misunderstanding ol .1
document filed In the plaintiffs lawyers,
much of the article — including the sec
ond, third, fourth and sixth paragraphs
— failed to cliarat tcri/e information as al

legations of the plaintiff, and implied that
they were undisputed fat ts.
111 lat t. the charges tlest ribetl are being
strongly disputed in court In the I niver
sit\ and Santa ( lara ( <ounty.
finally, references to the I niversit\
"seeking rejudgment" of the Z\ Ibert t ase
were erroneous. Stanford lias filed mo
tions in court for sununan judgment —
.1 legal tlevit e in whit h the t ourl is asked
to rule that, under the undisputed fat t s
of the case, the plaintiff s claims are insuf
ficient as a matter of law, and tli.it 110 trial
is necessary.
I lie sources ol these corrections were
court papers filed I)\ the I niversit\ and the
county, as well as statements In Stanford's
l)eput\ (General Counsel loin fennel".
flie DaiK regrets the above errors and
apologizes lor an\ harm the\ may have
caused to the parties involved.
