### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
today, the No. 2 Stanford men's cross country
team returns to (Ireenville, S.C., where it dominated
the Pre-NCAA meet earlier this season.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
Saturday: Stanford at NCAA championships,
11:00 a.m., Furman Golf Course, Greenville,
South Carolina

1 his time, though, the squad has its sights set on
the national title.
I he C '.ardinal will attempt to upset top-ranked (lol
orado in the 2001 NCAA Cross Country Champi
onships for its first national title since 1997.
Stanford must not only overcome (Colorado, but also
fend oil ovei achieving No. 3 .Arkansas, whit h has won
the national title three years running and always seems
able to pull off a huge race when it matters most.
I he competition will he intense as littlt* separates
the top teams.
Colorado maintains its lead over the Cardinal in
the polls b\ a hair's breadth.
1 lie \londo ( toss country poll last week ranked
(Colorado over Stanford by a rating 0f'193 to 381 â€” a
margin of Only 12 points.
Following last weekend's NC.AA Regional meets
(Stanford won the West Region In a resounding 54
points), that margin dropped to a mere two points.
I lowever, when it comes down to today's race, the
ranking and numbers games mean little.
Willi a field this dose, each elite team is capable of
healing the others, and the national title will go to the
team that gets the most solid performance out of as
many of its athletes as possible.
"()h\ iously the NCAAs will have the strongest field
in which we've competed," said head coach Yin
Lananna.
Nevertheless, Stanford will treat the title meet like
any other.
"()ur key to success will be to approach the compe
tition as we have each race this year," Lananna said.
"We will control the elements of the race we can and
not worry that the words 'national championship' ap
pear in the race title."
Such an approach is characteristic of the Stanford
team, which takes each race one at a time and values
preparation and execution of race strategy over its

place in the standings.
"We have alwa\s |aimed Ito set the standard foi e\
cellence in our sport, but the outcome of the race is
never the proper measurement of attaining that
goal," 1 .ananna said.
Be that .is it inav. tlu- outcomes <>t Stanford's races
have been extremeh impressive.
With back-to-bat k national titles in 199 band 1997
and a string of m\ con set utive West Regional titles to
its name, the Cardinal is consistentlv one of the
strongest programs in the nation.
Its chances of a national title this year look good,
but the Cardinal pack will have to deal with Col
orado's formidable trio of Jorge and I d lories and
freshman sensation Dathau Rit/enhein.
Skeptics of Stanford's title hopes point not onl\ to
Colorado's strength in its first three runners, but also
to the Cardinal's youth.
"We have a very voting team," I ananna said. "We
have no seniors on our team. ()ur top four runners
are sophomores."

Sophomores ('.rant Robison, lan Dobson, Don
Sage and Louis Luchini current!) lead the Cardinal
squad, hut Stanford did not enter the season without
senioi leadership.
Senior Cahe Jennings, a 21)00 Olympian and
N( AA( hampion in the 1,500 meters, was expected to
beoneol the (Cardinal's top runners. I lowever, he has
not competed since the Murrav keatinge Invitational
and w ill not run N( AAs.
I he ('.animal's younger runnel s have responded
b\ stepping up to a level attained hv ver\ lew colle
giate runnei s, regardless of age.
Young, perhaps, hut deep and talented, the Car
dinal squad is prepared foi competition.
\\ ith so main young athletes already at the top of
the collegiate standings, one can onl\ wonder at the
team's potential in years to come.
"I expect to see continued success from this
group," I.ananna said.
Sophomore lan Dobsonwasa hit more emphatic.
" I his is about starting a dynasty."
