When the last pass wont up, it tar
ried a lot of baggage. Stanford's sev
enth straight Big (lame \ i< tory hitched
a ride on the desperation-laden pass.
California's last chance for dignit\
latched onto the hall. And the pigskin.

fueled In 104 years of Big (iame magic,
tell incomplete.
I he West ('.oast's oldest rivalry was
never supposed to hinge on (lal quar
terback Kyle Boiler's last-second Mail
Mary, and when the Cardinal batted it
to the St an lord Stadium tint, Stanford
wiped its brow in relief and sighed with
contentment. W hat seemed inevitable

just hours before had finally been ac
complished.
California (0-10, 0-8 Pacific 10 Con
ference) entered the contest with as
many wins as it has original fight songs,
and seemingly had no chance against
the No. 13 ('.ardinal (7-2, 0-2).
But for Stanford the Big (iame turned
into tin' bad game, and as the final whis
tle signaled the Cardinal's 35-28 win,
Stanford's only solace was the fact that
the Bears had made more mistakes.
1 lungs that Stanford usualh takes for
granted — a potent running game,
penalty-free football and heavy-handed
ball control — were lint haracteristuall\
absent Saturday, and with live turnovers
the Cardinal offered ( al the game on a
silver platter.
But the Bears ollense rusted in the
game's final 13 minutes. Following
Boiler's 18-yard touchdown strike to
LaShaun Ward and a successful lake
PA 1 that tut Stanford's lead to seven,
Cal couldn't find the end /one for the t e
mainder of the match.
"I looked into coach | I'yrone] Will
inghain'seyes at the end ol thegameand
we both shook our heads at the same
time," said sophomore quarterback
Chris Lewis, w ho finished with 300 vards
passing and four lout below us to go with
three interceptions.
It didn't help that the Cardinal was
playing a battered rival.
Pride was Cal's only impetus, and
the Bears played an emotionalh
charged game. Witli the loss, Cal be
comes the worst team in Pac-10 histo
ry, and the Golden Bears only escape
from a winless season would be a vic
tory over 2-8 Rutgers next Friday in
New York.
Sophomore wideout Luke Powell
seems to have established himselfas Stan
lord's newest "Cal killer." Powell scored
on a 75-yard screen pass in the 2000 Big
(iame and followed it up this year with a
two touchdown, 152-yard effort.
Stanford stored first with a 20-yard
pass to Powell under double coverage,
but Cal recovered senior Brian Allen's
fumble a series later on the Stanford 28.
The Bears kicked a field goal and
then one play later safety Nnamdi Aso
mugha ripped Lewis's screen pass from
the air and returned it 16 yards fora
touchdown, giving Cal an improbable
10-7 lead as a roar erupted from the
blue and gold section of the 71,150 in
attendance.
