12:15 p.m., Furman Golf Course, (Greenville,
South Carolina

and reatlv to go. ()ften someone bursts out with '1 can't
believe it's this week!'

championships and the Nationals qualifier at the
Western Regionals t <>mpetition, the (Cardinal w ill face
stiff opposition at the Nationals meet.

Cardinal beat No. 2 Brigham Young I niversity, its
most likely rival fora national title, by 64 points.
B\ the NCAA pre-meet in mid-October, held on
the same course .is nationals, BY I had narrowed the
margin of victorv to a slim two points. Now another
month removed, the two teams will toe the line un
