MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 13 Stanford 81,
New Mexico 66

Talk about an understatement.
The No. 15 Cardinal encountered a
rowdy, not to mention eaisplitting, sold-out
crowd of 18,018 fans at The Pit Saturday
night, but managed to pull out an 81-66 victo
ry over New Mexico in the Cardinal's first
road opener since 1979.
Not only did the crowd deride the Stanford
players for every turnover, missed shot or
foul, some Lobo fans even threw objects at the
team after the game.
No wonder Stanford hadn't scheduled a
game in New Mexico in its 86-year history of
basketball.
"It was a pretty hostile environment,"

said freshman Josh ('.hildress. who finished
with 12 points on 5 of 1 1 shooting. "We
handled ourselves with composure and
poise, and we did the little things to pnll
out the victory."
That they did. Although junior Casey Ja
cobsen was double-teamed for much of the
night, he managed 1 7 points and also spread
the ball around with eight assists.
"A big reason that everybody scored was
Casey, "Childress said. "I le did a great job of
getting us the ball."
Five different players finished in double
digit scoring, including junior center Curtis
Borchardt, who tied jacobsen to lead the
Cardinal with 17 points, with two
ers. Borchardt also added a team-high 11
rebounds.
Senior point guard Tony Giovacchini
didn't turn the ball over once in 29 minutes of
play. He scored 13 points, all in the second
half, and went 3-for-3 from behind the three
point arc.
Giovacchini, the only senior in the Cardi
nal's starting lineup, wasn't too surprised with
the hostile crowd.
"That's just college basketball," he said.
"That's how it should be at Maples. That's
what it's all about and we knew it was coming

and we had to learn how we were going to re
spond to that kind of situation. It's something
ihis group hadn't seen. It's nice to get this one
under our belt.
Similat to the last two years, the Cardinal
showed that it can still make important runs ;it
crucial points of the game. I railing 20-12 in
the first half, Stanford fought back with a 2f)-
() run in the next I I minutes to take a 38-26
halftime lead.
I he closest the Lobos came in the second
half was at 02-51 after senior Lobo guard Eric
Chatfield scored eight points in a row.
Lobo guard Ruben Douglas, who led New
Mexico in storing last year, was held to only
one first half field goal.
Stanford finished the game nine-for-16
from behind the three-point arc and also
dominated inside the key, as sophomore for
ward Justin Davis scored 10 points, eight of
which came on tips off missed shots.
"They really showed a lot of poise and
stepped up and made some tough shots,"
Lobos coach Fran Kraschilla said. "You've got
to hand it to them. They proved that they
were a top-10 or top-15 team."
Stanford will host Southern Utah in its
home opener tomorrow night at Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m.
