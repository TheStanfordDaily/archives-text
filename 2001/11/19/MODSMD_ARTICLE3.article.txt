## Packard hospital aims to raise $500 million in fundraising drive 
### ANITHA REDDY STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to vault the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's 1 lospi
tal into the top tier of children's
hospitals nationwide, the Lucile
Packard Foundation for Chil
dren's 1 lealtli announced Friday
a five-year $500 million capital
campaign for the hospital and for
pediatric programs at the Med
ical School. A $ 100 million dona
tion from the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation, a separate
charity, will jumpstart the record
fundraising drive.
The 10-year-old hospital's ag
gressive plan to leapfrog to the
top of a list headed by such vener
able institutions as the children's
hospitals of Boston, Philadelphia
and Chicago, all founded in the
1860s, is a delayed reflection of
the University's successful efforts

to compete with Fast Coast uni
versities established mote than
300 years ago.
The financial resources of
older children's hospitals, such ;is
Boston Children's Hospital SHOO
million endowment, dwarf
Packard Hospital's $71 million
endowment.
"We at the foundation have
come to the conclusion that an in
vestment of this sort will vault Lu
cile Packard up to the first tier of
children's hospitals because it's
designed to bring here the very
best people anywhere in terms of
research and clinical care," said
Stephen Peeps, chairman and
C FX) of the Lucile Packard Foun
dation for Children's Health.
"That's how preeminence is at
tained."
The David and Lucile
Packard Foundation has also
pledged $200 million in match
ing funds for money raised by the
Lucile Packard Foundation for
Children's Health. Community
donors have already given $105
million toward the campaign,
bringing the total money raised

so far to $310 million.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the
Medical School and pediatric
cancer specialist, said tie be
lieves ilie hospital lias unique
advantages that will enable it to
become a leading children's
hospital in the coming decades.
Those include the expertise of
the hospital's staff and its physi
cal resources, and especially the
hospital's relationship with
Stanford I iospital and the Med
ical School.
"Without the proximity and
interactions of Packard with
Stanford, a children's hospital
alone would be unlikely to
achieve national excellence,"
Pizzo said. "Thus, having
Packard Hospital both able to
uniquely focus on children but to
also remain closely intertwined
with the School of Medicine and
the University creates an envi
ronment and breadth of re
sources that is nonpareil."
