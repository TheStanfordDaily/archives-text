### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford wide receiver leyo Johnson
looked into the crowd in his own end/one ;ii
Stanford Stadium alter scoring the eventual
dec iding touchdown in the fourth quarter ol
Saturday s Big Game and put a linger in
front of his mouth, gesturing to the Califor
nia faithful to he silent.
Immediately, a referee threw a flag for
"excessive celebration" for an act that few,
if any, players ever get penalized, even on
the road.
(oupled with bizarre interceptions, phan
tom penalties, blocked chip-shot field goals
and fake field go;ils gone awry, the annual
grudge match was simply weird.
I lie 104 th Big Game, or more appropri
ate!}, I lie Big Ugly, started promising but
quickly degenerated into a tug-of-war be
tween two teams that did everything to let the
other one win.
Amidst the chaos of a bizarre afternoon of
Ibotball, though, two things remained dear.
Stanford has the thoroughbreds.
Cal has the mules.
During the Cardinal's 35-28 victory that
would have put any sober individual into a
flu-like haze of confusion, one only had to
look at the leaders of both teams to see the
stark contrast between the two Bay Area loot
ball programs.
On Stanford's sideline: head coach I y
rone Willinghain, who has brought a pro
gram to the cusp of national prominence in

college football's toughest environment to
win, and quarter'bat k(lu is I ,cwis, whose fu
ture is so promising that ii is scary.
On Cal's sideline: lame duck head coach
1 <>111 1 lolmoe, representing;! California pro
grain mired in instability, and quarterback
Kyle Boiler, whose future frightens Bears
fans lor all the wrong reasons
During the last three years, Boiler and
Lewis have been a reflection of their respec
tive programs.
While I .ewis was delic atel\ nourished and
redshiried to learn under Stanford's talented
quarterbacks. Boiler did not have such luxu
ries. as he was inserted into an inept oflensive
as a freshman.
Coaches often sa\ that quarterbacks can
be ruined if they are thrown into games un
prepared. On Saturday, Boiler looked like
a rattled quarterback in need of a confi
dence injection.
I le appeared puzzled at the line and often
misfired badly to his wideouts. When his tal
ent pierced through his inconsistency, his re
ceivers dropped his perfectly thrown passes,
symbolizing Cal's severe lac k of oflensive
playmakers
Oil the other side" ol the bail, Lewis, de
spite throwing three interceptions, began to
show the maturity ol an experienced veteran.
In the third quarter, after ('.ill had closed
the gap to 21-20. Lewis read the Bears' de
fense and saw that receiver Luke Powell had
single-c< iverage.

The Axe remains in Stanford's possession for the seventh straight year following the Cardinal's 35-
28 victory over the Golden Bears in the 104 th Big Game on Saturday.

Lewis has said that he felt like a junior high
quarterback w hen he played last season.
"I think I graduated to high school now,"
I .ewis joked. "I am almost there to becoming a
good college quarterback."
I he divergence between Lewis and Holler
carries greater significance, though. When
Stanford and ('.al were both struggling football
schools, a victory in the Big (la me defined theii

other game on the road towards greater na
tional success.

Johnson's silencing of the Cal crowd drew a flag for "excessive
celebration," but as his touchdown ended up deciding the game
for Stanford, the party continued.

Redshirt freshman running back Kenneth Tolon's 29-yard touchdown dash gave Stanford a 14-10 lead that it would
never relinquish. Playing in relief of the injured Brian Allen, Tolon led the Cardinal with 82 rushing yards.
