On Nov. IS, 1952, I lie Daily printed a
column l)v Pete (irothe.
"When I was a freshman (-al had die
Axe. I .1111 now .i senior and (.a I still has the
Axe. As a matter of fact, men in their second
year ol grad si liool have never seeen the
Axe's glistening blade. Kver since I have
been a freshman, people have been saying,
*|ust wait until next year.' lorus in the
(llass ol 'ixl, there is no 'next year. Ihe time
is now. Next year won't do. As the say in the
(llass II movies, I his is I I.
"And so here I sit, trving to figure out
how we are going to beat (<al.
"1 <im trying to figure out how .1 line that
couldn't consistently open holes against .i
second division (lub like ()regon can move
the Bear forwards. And how our sieve-like
pass defense is going to hold up. And how
our line is going to stop the terrific (lal run
ning trio of ()ls/ewski. Johnson and Powell.
And how <i kid who played third string half
back as .i freshman is going to (juarterbai k a
team to vie tory. And how our half-dozen in
jured plavers are going to fare under 11 it*
pli\sit al beating.
Bottom Line: Almost 50 years later, it's good to
know that the tables have turned.
