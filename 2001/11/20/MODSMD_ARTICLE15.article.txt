# Team may rebuild ancient Roman map
## 
### AMELIA DELAPAZ 
Almost 2,001) years ago, tlu'
ancient Romans constructed a
map so detailed th.tt it depicted
even building, door and stairway
in the c ity.
I"he Forma I t his Romae, or
Severan Marble Plan of Rome,
measured 00 feet by IT) feet and
covered an entile wall in a room
of the lemplum Paris in ancient
Rome's imperial foruni. F.very
feature of the c it\ was carved into
marble and painted red.
I lie map was constructed
sometime between 203 and 211
B.( during the reign of the em
peror Septiinius Severus. During
the late empire and early Middle
Ages, it was plundered and shat
tered, and no one has put it back
together since.
A Stanford team just might.
For the past 500 vears classical
arc heologists have tried to put the
pieces back together. But the most
comprehensive stuch of the artifact
is occurring here at Stanford. I he
project is a collaboration between
the ('.lassies Department and the
(oinputer Science 1 )cpartment.
Because of the plundering that
went on after the destruction of
the map, there are only 1,103 ex
isting fragments, which constitute
onl\ If» percent of the total area of
the map.
Yet, given the wa\ the map fell
from its position on the wall, the
remaining fragments are proba
bly clustered in the same areas.
1 herelore the possibility of recon

struction still exists.
Current researchers are taking
an entireh different approach
than anyone in the past has — or
even could —to reconstructing
the map. Instead of trying to fit
pieces together by hand, they are
trying to create a computer pro
gram th.it will do it for them.
In the spring of 1999 Marc
Levoy, an associate professor, of
computer science and electrical
engineering, and his research
team spent three weeks scanning
every fragment of the map then
discovered. Io do this tliev used
a laser that detected even the
slightest indentation in the sur
faces of the fragments.
Currentlv, Fevov and his team
are in the process of forming a
database that will contain detailed
information about each fragment.
1 his database is an important step
because it will allow them to have
the readily accessible information
for future research.
1 he team has also created a
:u> viewer of the scanned pieces.
A person using the viewer can
rotate and change the light on
three dimensional images of the
fragments. It allows one to make
new observations that mav have
been ver\ difficult by another
method.
I lie project is not, however,
limited to facultv and graduate
students. Junior Andv Martin, ju
nior I i/ Clevenger and sopho
more |ake Denmark all assist
Classics Asst. Prof. I l imbic, who
leads the archaeological side ol

the project, with her research.
1 limbic said that the group
learns about c lassical archeolog\
as the> work. I ach of the three fo
cuses on a different aspect ol the
map, such as apartment build
ings, temples or baths. I he\ liave
learned how to differentiate these
features from each other and
have learned important facts
about each building's significant e
to the Romans.
For the investigators involved
in the projec t, the combination of
computer s( ience and archeologv
is one ol the most stimulating as
pects of their research.
" l he collaboration is really in
teresting. Ii has changed our wav

of thinking," nimble said.
In deciphering this map,
I rimhle and her colleagues hope
to teach more people about Rome
and its history.
"One reason [for completing
this project] is to get it out to a
wider audience," 1 l imbic said.
I he artifact s potential for in
sight into lilt- Roman world has
been what lias drawn scholars to it
for so nianv years. Ibe lav scholars
know fairly well what life was like
lor the powerful in ancient Rome.
However, the Forma Urbis
Romae has the possibility to re
veal exciting new facts about the
life of the common people of the
eternal citv at that time.

pounds; it represents just one piece of what this group of Stanford researchers
are struggling to re-assemble.
