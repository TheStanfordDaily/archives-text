## The
						Stanford Daily High-price sperm solicitation not particularly troubling 
### 
Published Since IH'> I

A thirty-four year old woman in
Burlingame is hoping to give birth
to a healthy, intelligent and attrac
tive child sometime within the next
two years.
I his gives her something in common with
nearly .ill other hopeful mothers in the world.
What separates her from the pack, however —
and m.ikes her controversial to some — is the
method by which she is hoping to have the
child, via artificial insemination with sperm
from a Stanford male.
In fact, she is willing to pay $15,000 for the
sperm of a tall, handsome and personable Stan
ford student with blond hair and blue eyes.
The oiler has sparked debate among stu
dents and community members over its impli
cations and the bar it might set lor future
sperm donations, (lertainlv, important ethical
and moral issues come into play with this or
any other reprodiutive matter.
However, those not opposed to sperm do
nation in general should think twice before
calling this woman's oiler unethical. Also, those

who are not troubled by the use of appearance
based preferences for dating and marriage
partners should not be troubled by the speci
ficity of the woman's request.
Yes, the $15,000 sum is exorbitant. But
sperm donors are already handsomely com
pensated — at the crvobank on this campus,
for instance, anonymous donors can expect to
earn $ 150 a week over a six-month period. By
agreeing to pay a much greater sum, the
woman is hoping to generate attention and a
large pool of potential donors. This will also
give hci more personal choice in the matter, as
she will get to meet candidates before deciding
w hose sperm to receive.
I he price tag is eye-opening and may seem
like it might cause a student to change his prin
ciples. I lowcvcr, if tlii' monetary reward makes
someone consider sperm donation, that would
not necessarily be an ethical compromise. I he
donoi may come to believe, as many people al
ready do. that sperm donation is a noble act, as
it gives women otherwise unable to bear chil
dren an opportunity to do so.

Additionally, the vastly dillcrent relative
weight that 515,000 < al lies for individual stu
dents should he considered by those wishing to
pass judgement on the donors.
I he second argument that many ol the
woman's critics have raised is that her request
is superficial or even racist. By limiting the field
to handsome, tall, blond-haired and blue-eyed
candidates, she is excluding many otherwise
worthy males from contention.
However, main people consciously or sub
consciously make appearance-based decisions
when determining whom to date, marry and
procreate with. 1< > some women, this means dat
ing males who are six leet or taller, lb others, it
may mean onl\ dating men with broad shoul
ders or dark hair. I hese are siinpK questions of
preference, and women who date men with
these phenotypes are maximizing the chances
that their children will share the characteristics.
1 'his particular woman has limited the can
didate field to ('..iiu asian males, but that alone
sa\s nothing about her attitudes towards
members of other ethnic groups. In his book

" I'lu' Disuniting of America," historian Arthur
Schlesinger reports that over 85 percent of
marriages in America today are between mem
bers of the same race. This in and of it sell does
not mean that over 85 percent of Americans
are racist — it simply means that most of them,
for whatever reason, marry within their own
race and thus guarantee that their children will
be racially similar to themselves.
Admittedly, a future world in which the best
genes for offspring went to the highest bidder
is a scary thought. I lowever, this case is anoma
lous, and still more than 99 percent of preg
nancies result from traditional male-female
coupling. Ill is woman's oiler does nothing to
change that reality.
I hose who oppose sperm donation, artifi
cial insemination or appearance-based mate
preferences would be consistent to challenge
the Burlingame woman's offer. However, it
would be inconsistent anil hypocritical for
those who condone or partake in these prac
tices to cast negative judgement upon this
woman or the Stanford donor candidates.
