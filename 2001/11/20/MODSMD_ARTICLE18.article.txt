It is this: we can have enormous influence
on each other.

xve stood at just the right
moment — the ( rilical
point — so it feels as if
we pulled the hesitant

members of the audience from their
seals. We probahlx did.
Because xve lail to sec, truly, that the
world works like standing ovations —
with critical points and sudden changes
— xve miss the critical opportunities we
have to influence the world around us.
It's not that xve don't have lots of evi
dence from the natural world. It is re
plete with examples of negative leedbac k
loops (equilibrium) apparently tipping
into positive leedbac k loops (sell-perpet
uating change). A neuron doesn't fire
until it receixes just enough stimuli to
push it over the edge. The (bain read ion

mass of uranium. I he kch Imp sticks in
the bottle until a single tap pushes it .ill
out. I he world's population suddenly
shot up from one to six billion. Colloqui
ally, we even say that one straw of hay
breaks the camel s back.
I he problem is that we prefer to view
out selves as powerless non-participants
in a story of life. We attribute real powei
to characters like "inflation," "Israel" and
"General Electric," forgetting that these
are abstract names for the ac tions of mil
lions of people. And we like to pit these
characters against each other: I lie "fed
eral Reserve" fights "inflation" and tries
to influence "the invisible hand.
"China" faces off against "Taiwan."
When we tell the story this way, it's sim
ple and exciting.
Ihe few human beings that we consid
er characters in our story, xve make into
heroes — unrealistically glorified indi
viduals. We like to say that Abraham Lin

()r better vet. consider one ol our la
vorite heroes, Rosa I'arks, the black
woman w ho lamouslx refused to sit in the
hat k of the bus. We so often play up the
spontaneity and romance of her refusal
that we ignore the real contcxt. I his was

was the woman w ho refused to cooperate
with an unpopular policy at the right
time — the critical point?
Ol course, these critic,il moments are
notexvorthv: tliex signal an important
shilt. But which is more important, that
there was a standing ovation, or that
John Doe participated?
When xve talk about someone single
handed!) causing the standing ovation,
xve concede our power to them. To say
that "Rosa I'arks caused the Mont
gomery Bus Boycott" is to suggest that
others, including ourselves, didn't have a
role, that xve were merely spectators. In
the same way, xve speak of "markets" as if
thex existed independent of people like
ns, or "the- government" as if it weren't a
creation of citizens like us. So xve feel
small, to our own detriment. We com
plain about politics, but we don't vote.
We complain about single-minded pur
suit of profit, but eagerly work for and
oxvn companies doing just that.
Advertisers — people whose liveli
hood depends on creating mini social
trends — are not fools. I'hey understand
how powerful we can be as billboards. So,
at every opportunity, they plaster mes
sage's on our chests, backs, butts, ankles,
arms, foreheads, shoulders and legs.
People who like our c lothing, for exam
ple, bux their own and then advertise to
the next customer.
But this advertising strategy only
