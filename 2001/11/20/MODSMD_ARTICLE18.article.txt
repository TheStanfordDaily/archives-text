There is a l ruth linking witlun

It is this: we can have enormous influence
on each other.

moment — the ( rilical
point — so it feels as if
we pulled the hesitant

members of the audience from their

Because xve lail to sec, truly, that the
world works like standing ovations —
with critical points and sudden changes
— xve miss the critical opportunities we
have to influence the world around us.
It's not that xve don't have lots of evi

When xve talk about someone single

xve concede our power to them. To say
that "Rosa I'arks caused the Mont
gomery Bus Boycott" is to suggest that
others, including ourselves, didn't have a
role, that xve were merely spectators. In
the same way, xve speak of "markets" as if
thex existed independent of people like
ns, or "the- government" as if it weren't a
creation of citizens like us. So xve feel
small, to our own detriment. We com
plain about politics, but we don't vote.
We complain about single-minded pur
suit of profit, but eagerly work for and
oxvn companies doing just that.
Advertisers — people whose liveli
hood depends on creating mini social
trends — are not fools. I'hey understand
how powerful we can be as billboards. So,
at every opportunity, they plaster mes
sage's on our chests, backs, butts, ankles,
arms, foreheads, shoulders and legs.
