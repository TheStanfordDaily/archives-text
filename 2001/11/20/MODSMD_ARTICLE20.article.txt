most prominent political organizations
will jointly sponsor a new course being

oflered in the winter quarter to focus on
the most salient questions we must ask
ourselves in the wake of Sept. I I. Discus

others have demonstrated keen student
interest in a course that would address
win .ind how our world and our genera

struck Washington and New York. Stu
