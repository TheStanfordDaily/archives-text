# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Feinstein-Kyl bill would be detrimental to U.S. and other nations 
### ROGER LEVY, AMBER BAKER ALI ALEMOZAFAR GUEST COLUMNISTS 
p- —Ik' \ isii Kntr\ Reform Bill of
2001 was recently introduced
In Senators Dianne Feinstein
_JL (1) —i.\) and Jon Kyi (R —A/)
with the purpose of enhant ing the set u
rity ol U.S. bordei s. While we are s\ mpa
thetii to the spirit ol the hill, we wish to
draw attention to one ol i t >. par lieu lai
proposals: a near-categorical ban on the
issuing of student visas to t iti/ens oft oun
tries on the Stale Department's list ol ter
rorist-sponsoring states.
I his list currentl) includes Iran, Iraq,
Sudan, l.ilna, Syria, North Korea and
Cuba. We believe that such a ban would be
unjust and ineffective.
I he economic and cultural contribu
tions ol students from these counti ies have

been substantial. In the last decade,
10,000 students have come to stud) in the
I .S. from these countries, 13,000 ol'them
from Iran alone. l he potential adverse ef
fects of the ban proposed bv Feinstein and
K\ I are quite acute. I he I .S. stands to lose
the considerable present and future con
tributions of Iranian and other students
and future highly-trained workers.
For their part, Iran and other coun
tries on the list stand to lose a future gen
eration of I S.-educated leaders activeh
contributing to moderation and democ
ratization in their home societies, l he
proposed legislation also overlooks .in
ongoing and vibrant struggle for democ
rat:) and freedom in Iran that has
achieved results stub as the overwhelm
ing popular < hoite of political moderate
Mohammad Khatami as president dur
ing last year's democratic: elections.
I he discussion on banning student

visas, which lias received large criticism
from (he academic community a< ross the
nation, arose when it was discovered that
one of the hijackers had come to the I nil -
ed States on a student \ isa.
I his man, who was not a national ol
any of the seven countries on the State
Department list, never actually arrived
on his campus.
I here are many other ways to verify
that the student sis.i system is not being
abused, such as ensuring ili.it students
are in tact enrolled in the universities
they are scheduled to attend. A complete
ban on these student visas does not logi
calh or practicalh address the actual
abuses to the s\ stem.
I here is little evident e that students ap
plying lot I .S student visas from the
seven countries singled out In Feinstcin
and kvl constitute a terrorist threat. From
the combined list ol the 1 ( .) suspected Sept.

1 I hijackers plus the FBl's most want
ed terrorists, onl\ one out of 41 is from
these seven countries — no more than the
number of U.S. citizens on the list. I he al
legations that tit) exist against these states
are against their governments, for cooper
ating with alleged terrorists typicalh from
other countries.
If we believe terrorism is a disease that
must be treated at its roots, then banning
student visas will actually be counterpro
ductive. Ii will have no negative conse
quences lor the relevant governments and
will punish only ordinan members of so
t ieties where ground-level support for ter
rorism is largeh absent. F.xtensive back
ground checks already are in place for stu
dent visa applicants from these countries,
so the I .S. is not casting its net too looseh.
I nder the proposed bill, in contrast, visas
could onlv be issued after direct review by
iht' Set relar\ of St ate, which is haul to take

seriously it you imagine C.olin Powell
nuclei tlic burden of 1,000 visa application
reviews yearly.
We must draw ;i linn distinction be
tween the policies of states and the attitudes
of people. The overwhelming majority of
student visa applicants from all countries,
including those on the State Department
terrorism-sponsoring list, are among the
brightest and most open-minded members
of their generation. We should welcome
them with open arms and give them op
portunities for c onstruc tivc engagement in
U.S. academic institutions. Kai from being
a threat, they are our future best ambas
sadors and greatest hope. In fact, the\ are
the ones who can pave the w a\ foi the much
needed Dialogue Among ( i\ilizniions that
the I nited Nations has been trying to ad
vocate. We urge you to contact your repre
sentative today and voice your opposition
to this flawed proposal.
