country meet

behind Colorado coming into the
meet, solitlh defeated No. 3

but tame up oil I\ one point shv of

I he difference was literally
under one second.
Stanford junior Setli I le|ii\ was
edged in a finishing kick In less
than a second, while Colorado's
Sean Smith barelv out-kit ked two

other runners.
A half-second's difference in ci
ther case would have meant a
Stanford victory.
"I was out-kicked for the first
time ever in a cross country race,"
1 lejnv said.
Stanford displayed its notori
ous depth and had a better show
ing than Colorado in the third
through fifth scorers. All live Car
dinal scorers plated in the top 43,
bettering Colorado's placing its
five in the top sb.
However, Colorado's strength
up front (Jorge 1 ones and
Dathan Rit/enhein placed second
and fourth, respectively) proved
to l)t' just enough to edge the (lar
dinal.
Sophomore Don Sage led the
Cardinal, finishing seventh over
all in a time of 29 minutes, 24 sec
onds over the 1 0,000-meter
course.
Sophomores Louis I.uthini
(29:41), lan Dobson (29:53),
(itant Robison (29:53), I lejnv
(30:14), freshman Ryan llall
(30:43) and
junior Daniel l'arris (31:04) fol
lowed in 12th, 20th, 21st, 43rd,
7btli and 108 th respectively.
Disappointed with the result
but not with their performance,
the Cardinal men know they left
everything out on the course.
"We went out hard and got
ourselves in a position to win, so
you can't be disappointed," Sage
said. "We ran tough."

the race and making it difficult to

"1 think we were all red-lining a

Robison led (lie Cardinal pack
in the early stages of the race,
keeping pace with the leaders,

and likewise wonders how the last

he said. "It wouldn't bother me so
much if we didn't lose- l>\ one
point."
"I hate losing. Kveryoneon this
team hates losing." Dobson said.

"I for one am going to clo every
thing in my power to make sure
that I never leel this way again."
"We came in here with the
motto, 'Yon ain'i seen noihin"
yet,' and I still think that's true,"
Dobson said. "When we put
everything together it's going to
