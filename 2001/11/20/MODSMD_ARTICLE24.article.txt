MEN / S BASKETBALL
Tonight: No. 1 3 Stanford vs.
Southern Utah, 7 p.m., Maples
Pavilion

And vet, it has onl\ plaved one
game.
Believe it or not, when No. l!t
Stanford plavs its home opener
against Southern I tab .it Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:.'t() p.m., the
(ardinal will not be the same team
that stepped onto the eomt in its
two exhibitions games.
Instead, it will be a team that has
alreadv seen how tough this year
might be — a team that knows it
tan win under the most hostile of
environments, and a team that, as
voting as it is. is becoming more
veteran-like at an exponential
pace.
All because of one game.
Frankly, Stanford's trip to 1 lie
I'it in New Mexico lor its season
opener didn't seem like the best
idea to many ('.ardinal fans — and
the players for that matter —just
one a week ago. I leading into a
venue notorious for being one of
the most unfriendly, not to men
tion loudest, in the country, didn't
exactly look inviting to a team that
lacked experience and a definite
rotation.
I he ( '.ardinal even had history
against it — the last time Stanford
had opened the season on the rc >ad
and actually won was in 1900.
But, in retrospect, after its 81-
(><) handling of the Loboson Satur

da\, the trip to New Mexico w.ts
probabb the best thing that could
have happened.
"It was the biggest crowd I have
evei played in front of and its so
important right now carh in the
season to get that experience."

Junior Curtis Borehardt has been plagued by foot injuries during his first
two seasons at Stanford. A switch in jersey number may change his luck.
