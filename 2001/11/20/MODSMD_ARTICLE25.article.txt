" I hat all just st it ks in ni\ mind.
11 realh wasn't fun," Borehardt
said.
\s most people know, Bor
ehardt. a 7-foot, 240-pound ju
nior (enter, has been plagued
with an ailing right foot. In both
the last two seasons, after the
same game (20th), against the
same team (I SC), Borcharclt's in
jury has forced him to sit out the
rest of the year.
I herelore, using the phrase
"Dcja mi" around him is not cxact
l\ the best idea.
1 "his year, however, there are
signs, both trivial and meaningful,
that ma\ point to a happ\ ending.
Not onl\ docs the Cardinal pla\
()rcgon — not the I rojans —in its
20th game, Borehardt also had
successful surgen on his loot in
March and has had significant
time over the summer to recover,
revamp and rebuild.
"I feel good," said Borehardt,
w ho stored 17 points and snagged
a team-high 1 1 rebounds in the
Cardinal's season-opening victon
over New Mexico. "I'm moving
heller ibis year than I did all of last
year. List year I felt limited and I
played limited."
His teammates have noticed
the ellccis of his extra cflort as well.
"He hasn't stopped working
on his body and his game and
you can tell. I Ic's !M) pounds
heavier," senior point guard
Tony Giovacchini said. "Now, I
think lie's finally gotten over that
hurdle ,ind lie's overdue to have
a really good year for us."
()l course, after the frustra
tions of'the past two seasons, Bor
c hardt is doing anything he can
to reassure himself that he'll be
healthy this year. 1 herefore, al
though he denies that lie's super
stitious, he admitted tli.it he
changed jersey numbers from
No. 1 I to No. 2 looking for the
same luck Jason Collins had
w hen he switched to No. 34 after
two injury-plagued seasons as
No. :w.
"Jason's now in the NBA, so I fig
ured I'd try myself." Bot e hardt said.
"It couldn't hurt. I couldn't make
things worse."
Bore'hardt s light. He, himself,
has nothing to lose. But the Cardi
nal has a lot at stake if its starting cen
ter is not completely healthy come

crunch time. With the loss n| si/e in
the front court due to the departure
of Jason and Jarron Collins. Bor
chardt's presence on the court in
critical situations is essential.
"Curtis is probabh the biggest
key to our success this year," sopho
more guard Matt loltich said, "lie
does a lot of things we lac k like re -
bounding and shot bloc king and
being a consistent scorer in tlu* post.
"Without him, we're not going to
be nearly as good as we could be."
Bore hardt said he rcali/cs lie- lias
to be more careful this season pla\ -
ing in the key. He compared the
Collins twins to that of a sccurih
blanket, because he didn't have to
worry about foul trouble or making
mistakes on defense;.
"If I wasn't playing well, tliev
were going to be in there leading
our team. This year, I'm going to
have to cut back a little bit on in\
defensive aggressiveness so that I
can stay in the game for lougei pe
riods of time and sta\ more consis

tent, ooi( n.lull said.
Simph put, the tables have
turned after two seasons. Bor
(liardt, who averaged (>.f points
and 1.2 rebounds per game last
\ear, is now in a position of leader
ship — the same wa\ the Collins
tw ins were to him.
"It makes me feel better that if I
get lx*al. ( urtis is going to be there."
said sophomore forward Justin
Da\is. Bore hardt s main cohort in
the front court."I laving a partner
like that is important."
So, although only time will tell
how the third chapter of the melo
dramatic saga of "The l .ilcol Bor
c hardt' w ill end, one thing is for
sure: right now. lie's just happy to be
back on the court.
"All of this has made me appreci
ate being able to play that much
more. I realize thai it's a privilege to
be able to go out and play hard
everyday," Bore hardt said. "1 also
know thai I can bounce back from
anything now."

said.
\s most people know, Bor
ehardt. a 7-foot, 240-pound ju
nior (enter, has been plagued
with an ailing right foot. In both
the last two seasons, after the
same game (20th), against the
same team (I SC), Borcharclt's in
jury has forced him to sit out the
rest of the year.
I herelore, using the phrase
"Dcja mi" around him is not cxact
l\ the best idea.
1 "his year, however, there are
signs, both trivial and meaningful,
that ma\ point to a happ\ ending.
Not onl\ docs the Cardinal pla\
()rcgon — not the I rojans —in its
20th game, Borehardt also had
successful surgen on his loot in
March and has had significant
time over the summer to recover,
revamp and rebuild.
"I feel good," said Borehardt,
w ho stored 17 points and snagged
a team-high 1 1 rebounds in the
Cardinal's season-opening victon
over New Mexico. "I'm moving
heller ibis year than I did all of last
year. List year I felt limited and I
played limited."
His teammates have noticed
the ellccis of his extra cflort as well.
"He hasn't stopped working
on his body and his game and
you can tell. I Ic's !M) pounds
heavier," senior point guard
Tony Giovacchini said. "Now, I
think lie's finally gotten over that
hurdle ,ind lie's overdue to have
a really good year for us."
()l course, after the frustra
tions of'the past two seasons, Bor
c hardt is doing anything he can
to reassure himself that he'll be
healthy this year. 1 herefore, al
though he denies that lie's super
stitious, he admitted tli.it he
changed jersey numbers from
No. 1 I to No. 2 looking for the
same luck Jason Collins had
w hen he switched to No. 34 after
two injury-plagued seasons as
No. :w.
"Jason's now in the NBA, so I fig
ured I'd try myself." Bot e hardt said.
"It couldn't hurt. I couldn't make
things worse."
Bore'hardt s light. He, himself,
has nothing to lose. But the Cardi
nal has a lot at stake if its starting cen
ter is not completely healthy come

crunch time. With the loss n| si/e in
the front court due to the departure
of Jason and Jarron Collins. Bor
chardt's presence on the court in
critical situations is essential.
"Curtis is probabh the biggest
key to our success this year," sopho
more guard Matt loltich said, "lie
does a lot of things we lac k like re -
bounding and shot bloc king and
being a consistent scorer in tlu* post.
"Without him, we're not going to
be nearly as good as we could be."
Bore hardt said he rcali/cs lie- lias
to be more careful this season pla\ -
ing in the key. He compared the
Collins twins to that of a sccurih
blanket, because he didn't have to
worry about foul trouble or making
mistakes on defense;.
"If I wasn't playing well, tliev
were going to be in there leading
our team. This year, I'm going to
have to cut back a little bit on in\
defensive aggressiveness so that I
can stay in the game for lougei pe
riods of time and sta\ more consis

tent, ooi( n.lull said.
Simph put, the tables have
turned after two seasons. Bor
(liardt, who averaged (>.f points
and 1.2 rebounds per game last
\ear, is now in a position of leader
ship — the same wa\ the Collins
tw ins were to him.
"It makes me feel better that if I
get lx*al. ( urtis is going to be there."
said sophomore forward Justin
Da\is. Bore hardt s main cohort in
