With his double overtime goal
Friday night to break a stalemate
with No. 11 Washington, Fernan
dez not only dim bed Stanford's
1 alb victory of the season, but also
guaranteed Stanford at least a share
ol its first Pat ilit 10 conference title
in history.
"After the goal I didn't know
what to do with myself," said Fer
nandez of his fourth goal this sea
son. "We'd worked for this tit It*
from the beginning, and it is an im
portant stepping stone for the n.i

tional championship."
With Sunday's 3-1 win over Ore
gon State, Stanford surpassed
UCLA in points with 1 ( .) and
claimed sole possession of the
cn >wn.
Not had lor a team adjusting to a
new head coach and picked to finish
third in preseason league polls.
Despite nine straight wins to kick
oil the season, Stanford lost its con
ference opener to I CIA 2-1. Since
th.it loss on Oct. 14, however, the
team has not lost a game and rolled
through the rest of its conference
schedule with six wins and one tie.
I his remarkable run ended last
weekend in the Pacific Northwest as
Stanford defeated its final two con
ference opponents to seal the title. A
win and a tie were all the Cardinal
needed to take the crown, but the
squad took the title in st\ le with two
wins.
"We're .ill so excited, winning a
conference championship is out
right special." said senior 1 ravis
|. mics. " 11 lis is an accomplishment
ill.H has not been done before .it
Stanford and it's a goal that we
worked for all vcar."
On Irida\ night, Ihe Washing
ton Huskies (12-5-0, 3-4-0 Pac
-10) almost plaved the spoilers as
tlie\ took the C.ardinal into dou
ble overtime and were only one
go.tl awa\ from ruining Stan
ford's title run.
I lie always powerful Stanford
defense — which has recorded II
shutouts .nul has allowed a conler
ence-low eight goals .ill season —
(lamped down and did its part to
hold oil the 1111sk\ .itt.u k. Fresh
man Robin Fulton stepped up .is
well, recording a career-high six
saves in the game.
I he game was then left in the
hands of a prolific Stanford of
fense. which recorded a confer
enc e-liigh 17 goals this season. De
spite numerous scoring chances
from both sides, including a 21-14
margin in favor oft lie C.ardinal, the

game remained deadlocked and
was sent into overtime.
Alter 110 minutes of playing
time, a draw seemed inevitable until
Fernandez slotted home bis third
game-w inner ol't be season bom ten
vards out oil .111 assist b\ junior Jo
banes Maliza.
"It w.is a great game and we
plaved well, head toad) Simon
said. "Hut Washington also plaved
\er\ well and it was realb a game
where an\ plaver eon Id have made
the difference with one plav. Both
goalkeepers plaved well and thev
held oil (|italit\ c bailees. I here were
twogt>( ul teams battling in the game
and there wasn't a whole lot of dif
ference between them. - '
" I his year we've been espec i.il
b good <11 finishing in important
moments," Maliza said. "When
the game's been on the line peo
ple have stepped up. especialh
Roger |l.evesque| and Darren
| Fernandez |."
I bis win look a bit of the pres
sure olf of the team's matt hup with
Oregon Stale (5-12-0, 1-7-0) on
Sunday. Needing onl\ a tie as ii
walked onto the field, the ( ardinal

named I'at 10 men's sort er plaver
of the year — stored his career-high
10th goal <>l the season onh lour
minutes into the game.
Fhe lead looked as though ii
might be in jeopardv roughly 15
minutes Liter when Fevesque, the

was ejected from the game.
Maliza added the crucial insur

Feading the game 3-0, the ( ar

net with 30 seconfls remaining in
the game.
"| I lie team] is very proud,"
Simon said." Ihe Pac-10 is a difficult
conference with four of the five
teams making il to the NC IY\ lour
