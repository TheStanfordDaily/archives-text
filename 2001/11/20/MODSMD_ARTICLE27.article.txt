### VESSELA STOYANOVA STAFF WRITER 
It was cold water that California
splashed into the face of the Stan
ford men's water polo team at Sat
urday's Big Splash, putting an end
to (be top-ranked Cardinal's 17-
gamc w inning streak.

MEN'S WATER POLO
Friday: No. 6 California 4,
No. 1 Stanford 3

Stanford (17-1, 8-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) had
maintained its status as the nation s
sole undefeated team until the reg
ular season's very last game, when
the Cardinal hosted the traditional
non-league match against archrival
Ciolden Bears.
I he last time the two teams met,
in October, Stanford handed No. ()
Cal (13-6, 3-5 MPSF) its first loss of

the season. 1 "his time, the Beat s got
their revenge by clinching a 4-M vic
tory over the previously unbeaten
Cardinal.
Stanford s defense performed in
its usual strong fashion as it had
throughout the season, holding its
opponent to a low four goals. 1 low
ever, something was not (lit king
right for the team's oflense, which
took home only three out of 31
shots, as opposed to Cal's four out of
15.
"We dominated the game in
every possible way except for scor
ing," said head coach Dante I)etta
manti.
Cal senior Spencer Dornin put
his team on the board two minutes
into the game's first period. It
wasn't until the second quarter that
junior Jeff Guyman made a come
back for Stanford off a deep pass
from jimioi goalkeeper Nick Kllis to
tic (lie male h 1-1.
()nl\ .1 lew secondslater, though,
sophomore Creg I'anawek put the
Bears in the lead again. 1 lie score
was 3-1 in (lid's liivor .it halftime
alter Dornin chalked up another
goid.
In the third quarter Cal be
came just the second team this
season to pull ahead of Stanford
In three, with a goal Irom senior
Joe Kaiser.
In the lourth period, Stanford
rallied back with two goals by red
shirt freshman l ony A/evedo to cut
Cal's lead to 4-3. In the lew nerve
wrecking last minutes ol the game,
the Cardinal missed a number of
opportunities that would have tied
the score and forced the game into
overtime.
I lie team's lailure to capitalize
on power plays hurt Stanford's ol
lense in an area where it normally
excels. Throughout the* season
Stanford has boasted a higher-than
average (>5-70 percent scoring suc
cess in extra-man situations. This
time against the Bears, the Cardinal
was not able to convert any of its
nine extra-mans into goals.
I lie explanation for this includes
.111 excellent performance by Cal's

goalkeeper, Russell Bernstein, who.
according to Dettanianti, "had the
game of his life." Bernstein tallied
13 saves, five of which were in the
first quarter, 112 ft* blocked three con
secutive A/evedo shots.
"It gave Bernstein a lot of confi
dent etobeabletoblcxk the nation's
top scorer," Dettanianti said. "That
set the tone for the rest of the game."
I his may have been why the
frustrated Stanford squad started
forcing its shots.
"Instead of giving a couple of
good lakes and throwing the ball for

,ui easy goal .it the post, we were re
ally persistent on trying to shoot
through their amis, and we just
made it more difficult for ourselves
than we needed to," 1- His said.
Putting the loss behind itself, the
(Cardinal is now lot using on the up
coming MI'SI and N(A\ c hampi
onships.
This was a good wake-up call lor
the team that has made us a little
more humble," Dettanianti said.
"We should use it as a learning ex
perience and move on because
we've got bigger lisli to fry."
