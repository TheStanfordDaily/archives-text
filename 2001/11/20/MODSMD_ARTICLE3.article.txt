ated course 101 nexl quarter titled

"Understanding 9-11: lis (.auses,
('.ontext and (iOiisequences."
"People want to talk about
what's happening, so we thought
one wa\ of furthering that discus
sion— not juM encouraging it but
contributing lo it iu a positive
wa\ — was to promote active dia
logue between students with a
first-class line up ol guest lectures
and panels, said senior Michael

lot us on issues sin li as the distinc
tion between terrorism and war,
I he role of the I .S. in \fghanistan

allow lex al experts to speak wit h the
students and give them the neces

sar\ background information for
well-informed student disc ussions.
I hough none ot the speakers

to invite people who w ill be able to
teach Stantbrd students about is
sues that lew ol us know very much
about but are extreineK important
to understand in the coming
months and vears." Aab said.
"Oncol the ke\ motivations in
this (lass was not just to have ex
perts come and tell students what
the\ think — which is valuable
and is a large part of our ( lass —
but to create a forum where stu
dents (an talk to each other about
these issues,"' she added.

point 111 American history and in
global histoiA that we will have to
deal with for the rest ol our lives.

to happen; there is demand, there
is interest, there are resources to
make it happen and there is I ni
vcrsitv-wide support."
