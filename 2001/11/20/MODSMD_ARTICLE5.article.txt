Wachtel described his new role as "to support

er, who was hard of hearing, that 1 was going to
study city planning," Wachtel said. "She thought I
said Yitv planting' and remarked, 'What a nice
thing —we need someone who knows how to
plant trees.' "
After eight years, numerous internships and a
brief stint as a civil litigator, Wac htel returned to

"It i> important that I he Daily

"I take great satisfaction from
my work by helping to make it
possible for fat ult\, students and
staff to do what the\ need to do,"
he added.
"Someday, however, I do hope
to fulfill my grandmother's dream
and continue my work, planting
trees."
