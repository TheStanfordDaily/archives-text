descent .is part ol its probe into
the Sept. 1 I terrorist attacks.
Since the attacks. federal au
thorities have contacted more
than 220 colleges and universi
ties, soliciting information
ahout Middle Fastern interna
tional students. 1 lie inquiries
have angered some students
w ho view su< h ac tions as a dan
gerous form of racial profiling
and an infringement on civil
liberties reminiscent ol Mc
(larthyism.
At most other universities, led
eral agencies contac ted adminis
tration to request the release ol
student records. However, the
Stanford student, who wishes to
remain anonymous, was contac t
ed directlv by the FBI.
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International (.enter,
said the I diversity lias yet to be
lormallv contacted.
"We've had no approach
from anv federal agent so far for
data or information about inter
nation.il students," he said.
I'lie contacted Stanford stu
dent said she received a message
on her cell phone from FBI au
thorities who said they needed
to meet with her but did not di
vulge why.
"They came to campus and
met with me for two hours and
asked me various questions
ranging from tny religious be

liefs to in\ sentiments about
poverty-stricken nations to my
future marriage plans," she said.
"They did not mention Sept.
I I specifically, but my ethnicity
and bai kground w ere a big part
ol the conversation."
She said the agents ques
tioned her about her feelings
toward the United States and
tei rorism.
" 1 heir questions seemed
geared toward understanding
m\ sentiments about this coun
try and countries abroad," she
said. " 1 hi'N did ask questions
like what I felt about theocratic
regimes and terrorism."
In contrast to the majority of
students interviewed at other
schools, the Stanford student is
an American citizen, not an in
ternational student.
Pearson noted that FBI in
vestigators had not requested
information from many ol Stan
ford's peer institutions.
"I have not heard of any of
the schools that we've been on
[e-mail lists] with, schools that
have similar student numbers
and student scholars, being con
tat ted yet,' he said.
However, in the last week,
FBI officials have contac ted ad
ministrators at universities in
cluding I larval d, (Columbia and
Georgetown, according to the
school's' student newspapers.

"I would be of the opinion that

Within Stanford's Islamic com

through e-mail and scheduled
discussions.
However, some students said
they are disappointed that the
issue has not received campus

"People can't believe it isn't

In ilk- hist month, tin* Feder
al Bureau of Investigation lias
interviewed at least one Stan
lord student ol Middle Fastern
descent .is part ol its probe into
the Sept. 1 I terrorist attacks.
Since the attacks. federal au
thorities have contacted more
than 220 colleges and universi
ties, soliciting information
ahout Middle Fastern interna
tional students. 1 lie inquiries
have angered some students
w ho view su< h ac tions as a dan
gerous form of racial profiling
and an infringement on civil
liberties reminiscent ol Mc
(larthyism.
At most other universities, led
eral agencies contac ted adminis
tration to request the release ol
student records. However, the
Stanford student, who wishes to
remain anonymous, was contac t
ed directlv by the FBI.
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International (.enter,
said the I diversity lias yet to be
lormallv contacted.
"We've had no approach
from anv federal agent so far for
data or information about inter
nation.il students," he said.
I'lie contacted Stanford stu
dent said she received a message
on her cell phone from FBI au
thorities who said they needed
to meet with her but did not di
vulge why.
"They came to campus and
met with me for two hours and
asked me various questions
ranging from tny religious be

liefs to in\ sentiments about
poverty-stricken nations to my
future marriage plans," she said.
"They did not mention Sept.
I I specifically, but my ethnicity
and bai kground w ere a big part
ol the conversation."
She said the agents ques
tioned her about her feelings
toward the United States and
tei rorism.
" 1 heir questions seemed
geared toward understanding
m\ sentiments about this coun
try and countries abroad," she
said. " 1 hi'N did ask questions
like what I felt about theocratic
regimes and terrorism."
In contrast to the majority of
students interviewed at other
schools, the Stanford student is
an American citizen, not an in
ternational student.
Pearson noted that FBI in
vestigators had not requested
information from many ol Stan
ford's peer institutions.
"I have not heard of any of
the schools that we've been on
[e-mail lists] with, schools that
have similar student numbers
and student scholars, being con
tat ted yet,' he said.
However, in the last week,
FBI officials have contac ted ad
ministrators at universities in
cluding I larval d, (Columbia and
Georgetown, according to the
school's' student newspapers.
Wit 11 the possibilitv of an olli
