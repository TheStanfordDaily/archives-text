# Doctor treats underprivledged teens
## Teen Van, a mobile medical clinic, serves uninsured and homeless teenagers 
### ANTHONY HA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford physician and his
staff are putting a number of at
risk Bay Area teens on the road to
good health — and they are
doing it out of a motor home.
The Adolescent Outreach Pro
ject, run by Dr. Seth Ammerman,
assistant clinical pfofessorat Lucile
Packard Children's I lospital, is the
only mobile medical clinic in the
United States that serves the gen
eral health needs of teens exclu
sively.
Founded in 1996, the clinic,
also known as the feen Van,
today treats patients in hoth Santa
Clara Counts and San Francisco.

The v;m provides comprehen
sive health care services to home
less and uninsured teenagers
twice a week — one day in each of
the two areas. Fach location has a
substantial and growing popula
tion of homeless adolescents:
1,500 in Santa (Mara County and
3,000 in San Francisco.
"This is one of the most med
ically underserved age groups,"
said Atnmerman, tlie program's
medical director. "It's not uncom
mon fora single patient to have
eight, 10 or even 12 separate di
agnoses on a single visit. 1 here's a
lac k of immunizations and a lot of
risky behaviors. Sometimes I feel
like I'm in a third-world country."
Based in a M-foot-long mobile
home, the I ecu Van stall in
cludes two physicians, a nurse,
two nurse practitioners, a social
worker, a nutritionist and a dri
ver.
l he program attempts to ad
dress social as well as medical
problems, often also providing its

patients with basic needs like food
and clothing. On average, the
staff treats about a dozen
teenagers per day, spending
about an hour with each patient.
Anunerman has spent many
years treating vouths in high-risk
situations, starting with a teen
program at Ceorge Washington
University's medical school.
He says he always enjoyed
working with teens and began to
think about a program like the
I een Van when the Children's
I lospital bought a van lor the pe
diatric department.
"I felt it was important for the
program to expand and serve
teens as well," Anunerman said.
Atnmerman got his break
when his lobbying coincided with
a United Way community assess
ment that revealed that homeless
and uninsured teens represented
the single most underserved
group in Santa Clara.
()ne of the people who became
involved in (he new program was
Erlinda (i. Stern, an adolescent
nurse practitioner. Stern said sin
was asked to join so that teenage
girls could be examined by some
one of their gender.
"Fora lot of these girls, it's re
ally important that the person
who looks at them be of the same
sex, because a lot of them have
been abused in the past," she said.
Currently, the aim of the Teen
Van initiative is to maintain exist
ing programs, rather than creat

ing new ones and expanding.
"()ur funding comes from gen
erous foundations and individu
als, so we need to keep raising
money," Ammerman said. "My
goal right now is to
strengthen our position before we
think about growth. My dream is
to one day be supported by en
dowments, but that is still very
much a dream."
Still. Ammerman said he finds
his work very rewarding. As an in
dication of the program's suc c ess,
he pointed to the fact that f>o per
cent of the van's patients return
for follow-up visits, a percentage
that is very high for teens.
"The program has been
around long enough that we can

sec that we've made a difference
and that some of the kids have
turned their lives around," he said.
"Of course, there are some kids
who are very difficult to reach,
which can be frustrating, but even
then most of them are very re
silient. It's very challenging.''
Stern agreed that the program
has been very successful, but
added that she wishes it could be
expanded to seven days a week.
"1 would really love to be out
there every day," she said. "A lot
of teens just need another adult
to talk to, someone who's going to
be caring for them. When it
comes to general teen care, both
medically and emotionally,
there's a vacuum."
