# Millions promised to Afghans for help

### 
WASHINGTON (AIM —
The U.S. military hopes that
Afghans seeking a $25 million
reward, not American soldiers,
will creep through caves hunting
for top al-Qaida terrorist leaders.
The bounty offered for
Osama bin Laden and his top
aides, plus additional reward
money from the GIA, should
encourage "a large number of
people to begin crawling
through those tunnels and
caves, looking for the bad folks,"
Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said Monday.
U.S. special forces and CIA
operatives for some time have
been spreading the word on the
ground that money would be
given to Afghans who cooperate
with the campaign to get bin
Laden and Taliban leaders.
Starting Sunclav, the rewards
also were publicized on Air Force
radio broadcasts and in leaflets
dropped over Afghanistan, Pen
tagon spokeswoman Victoria
('.larke said vesterday.
The U.S. hunt for terrorist
leaders has already met with
some success. I he Nov. 14
airstrike on a building south of
Kabul that killed al-Qaida's mil
itary chief, Mohammed Atef,
also killed another 50 al-Qaida
members, several senior I aliban
officials and an undisclosed
number of 1 aliban lighters, said
a U.S. official speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
At a Monday news conference,
Rumsfeld also said the United
States would not allow I aliban
leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar to leave his hometown of

Kandahar, even if the ami-1 al
iban forces surrounding the city
oiler him safe passage.
" 1 he idea of their getting
out of the countrv and going off
to make their mischief some
where else is not a happy
prospect," he said. "So mv hope
is that the) will either be killed
or taken prisoner."
Speaking on the 44th day of
I S. bombing in Afghanistan,
President George Bush said the
military was closing in on bin
Laden, the chief suspect in the
Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks. " I lie
noose is beginning to narrow,"
Bush said.
Rumsfeld was more cautious.
"As enenn leaders become
fewer and fewer, that does not
necessarily mean that the task
will become easier," he said.
"Peoplecan hide in c aves for long
periods. I his will take time."
He denied reports that I S.
intelligence has defined a nar
row search area for bin Laden
and his associates.
If the job of finding bin
I .aden falls to the I S military, it
will require different kinds of
troops than the special opera
tions forces now in Afghanistan,
Rumsfeld said.
He did not elaborate, but
other officials have said an in
fantry unit like the Army's l()th
Mountain Division might gel
the assignment.
Rumsfeld said the special
forces in Afghanistan — now
numbering several hundred —
had not vet pursued any I al
iban or al-Qaida leaders into
neighboring Pakistan.
