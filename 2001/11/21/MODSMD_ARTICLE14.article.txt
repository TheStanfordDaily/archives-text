### BARNALI DASVERMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Note: This is the second in a weekly series
that features contributions from students studying
and working in our nation's capital through tin
Stanf ord in Washington program. The columns xcilt
provide their unique perspectives on the events un
folding in Washington, DC., and across the globe.

"You will not only be witnesses, but a part ol
history." As I look back on the words Political
Science Prof. Adrienne Jamieson used to wel
come us to Stanford in Washington onl\ clavs
after the Sept. 1 Ith terrorist attacks, 1 am star
lied. What 1 took to be idealistic words ol en
couragement turned out to be surprisingh ac
c urate foreshadowing.
Indeed, through both tin internship and tn\
coursework in Washington, D.C., this c|iiarter.
I have literally found myself to be a part of his
tory in the making.
Despite the events of Sept. 11th, 1 remeinbei
taking Adrienne's insightful words lighth as I
prepared to depart tor D C. in mid-Septembei
"During this c ritical time, vou as Stanford
students have an opportunitv to contribute to
the decisions and policies that will shape oui
lives for years to come," she wrote. 1 was skep
tical of these words; I had been an intern in
l).(once before and couldn't see how 11 ii> ex
perience would be much different. Sure, Sept.
1 1 th changed things — but 1 had little idea ol

just how much it would c hange everything. Mv
skepticism was soon replaced l>\ awe.
Nlv first task as an intern at the State De
pal t men Is Bureau of \<>n proliferation was to
coordinate the bureau's participation in a 24-
hour task force, which was c reated for c risis
management during Operation Knduring
Freedom. As my office director sent out gen
uiueK patriotic e-mails urging his colleagues
to "serve their country" by manning the task
force, a jarring realization hit me: I was work
ing daily with foreign policy makers iu the
midst of a war.
Witliin da\ s of arriving at the State Depart
ment, I knew I had come at a tremendously tu
multuous time in which our nation's foreign
polio makers w ere constant 1\ formulating and
reformulating polic \ as the) responded to re
cent events.
Little w.is set m stone, and before mv eves,
old polic les were liberalh revamped as our na
tion's priorities shifted. 1 even had the honor ol
shaking hands with a President who once
shunned "nation-building," but now publicly
embracocl n in a speec li delivered in my pres
ent e. I quickly learned the meaning of the
term "()BL" — "()vercome B\ Kvents," mean
ing outdated — as it was frec|iientl\ used to
relet to pre .Sept. II memoranda.
1 found in\ sell becoming a part of history in
the making in the classroom as well. Indeed.
(in rem events wore thoroughly incorporated
into oui Stanford in Washington coursework.

My first written assignment in Iwas a
memo in which I took on the role of a W ash
ington bureau chief fora major American
newspaper and advised correspondents in the
field on war coverage. Last weekend, 1 found
myself writing a memo for my foreign policy
seminar on how the United States should en
sure tlie security of Pakistan's unclear arsenal
in today's volatile environment. 1 lie unique
circumstances under which my '21 classmates
and 1 came to !).(!. have influenced our stud
ies in more ways than I can count.
I hough it has been a time of fear and un
certainty, it has also been a gripping, fascinat
ing and exciting period in which to live, learn,
work and play in 1).(
While there have been times I wished 1
were safely ensconced in the Stanford bubble,
overall, 1 am genuinely glad I came to I).C.
this fall. A little over two months ago, I
thought Adrienne was joking; now I under
stand how dead serious her words were. 1 his
quarter, I've not only been a witness; I've been
a part of history.
