# ASSU Senate discusses supporting SLAC work
## Endorsement decision to be made Sunday 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite the noticeable absence
<>l mam senators, the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate managed to
engage in a lively debate that
strett lied yesterday's meeting into
nearly three hours.
An Advocacy Committee pro
posal to endorse the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition's work in
preventing Stanford Medical
('.enter's subcontracting of custo
dial positions made up much of
the (list ussion, ending in a Senate
dec ision to call a special meeting
Sunday night to settle the matter.
I he Advocacy Committee said
that SLAC had asked lor a quick
action on the issue, as it needed to
be endorsed by this coming Mon
day for the Senate to have any ci
ted upon the matter.
I'hey .ilso presented a case for
the relevance of the issue to stu
dent life in the higher quality of
t are provided by non-subcontract
ed workers.
l he committee also noted that
subcontracting provided a way for
the I Diversity to save money and
essentially pass the burden of em
ployee liability on to the subcon
tracting company.
"As consumers of the Universi
ty, we have say in where their
money goes,' said senator Son
risa Lucero, a junior.
I lie time pressure in SLAC's
request was noted In several sena
tors and senate associates, who
feared the Senate would be un
able to thoroughly research the is
sues and learn constituents' opin
ions in time to cast educated votes.

"We want to do things that are
up to high standards and I'm cu
rious if we have the time to do
that," senator Bo Cowgill, a ju
nior, said, casting one of two dis
senting votes (in a 5-2-1 decision)
against discussing the issue at a
special session.
It was also decided (in a 7-0-1
vote) that the resolution to en
dorse SI AC would require eight
positive votes to achieve Senate
endorsement, no matter how
many senators attended Sunday's
meeting. I herefoie, this issue will
not likely be decided at a meeting
with low attendance; a 5-3 vote,
for example, wouldn't be enough
to pass the resolution.
"That's the way coups are
started," said Student Life Com
mittee C '.o-(.hair Nick Rodriguez.,
a sophomore.
Commenting on the short time
frame available for making the deci
sion, Advocacy Committee Co-
Chair Ximena Martinez, a junior,
s,iid that the Committee had to cater
more to groups' needs while build
ing up recognition on campus.
"I agree it is time pressured,"
Martinez sai<l. but noted that
"right now, it's our responsibility
to reach out to groups."
She also noted that the bureau
cratic analysis inherent in the
Senate frustrated her, for it de
layed action on issues warranting
or requiring a timely response.
Martinez said she hoped that a
set of guidelines for student
groups desiring Advocacy Com
mittee and Senate action on issues
of student concern could be de
veloped in the future. Currently,
no such item exists.
"If we want this mission to en
dure," she said, "We would want
to institutionalize something like
that protocol."
