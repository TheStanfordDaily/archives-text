# Court blocks Ashcroft's attempt to end physician-assisted suicide law

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal
judge extended a court order yesterday
that blocks an attempt by Attorney Gener
al John Aslurofi to dismantle Oregon's
one-of-a-kind law allowing physician-as
sisted suicides.
U.S. District Judge Robert Jones ex
tended his Nov. 8 temporary restraining
order and gave attorneys up to five
months to prepare arguments in Ore
gon's case against the Justice Department.
The judge said his order "nullifies giv
ing any legal effect" to Ashcroft's direc
tive — in other words, doctors should
not fear legal repercussions if they follow

the ()regon law.
I he state has asked Jones to perma
nently block Ashcroft's Nov. 6 order that
prohibited doctors from prescribing
lethal doses of federally controlled drugs
to terminally ill patients.
At least 70 people have used the law
since it took effect, according to state
health officials. All have done so with a
federally controlled drug.
Ashcroft's order prompted the court
challenge, with Oregon officials saying
the government was trying to strip the
state of its right to govern the practice of
medicine.

During a four-hour hearing, Justice
Department attorneys argued that Ore
gon does not have the right to be an ex
ception to federal drug laws.
But Steve Bushong, an Oregon assis
tant attorney general, argued thai
Ashcroft's order exceeded powers given
to him by Congress.
The judge also voiced displeasure with
the way Ashcroft had issued the order —
he has called it an "edict" — and ques
tioned whether the order might discour
age doctors elsewhere worried about
over prescribing pain medication.
Jones posed a hypothetical situation

requiring ;i doctor to prescribe so much
medicine to a patient suffering great pain
it renders him or her unconscious, and
then hastens death.
Such situations are common, the judge
suggested. "Doctors are then subjected to
scrutiny," Jones said.
Under Oregon's Death with Dignity
Law, doctors may provide — but not ad
minister — a lethal prescription to termi
nal!) ill adult state residents. It requires
two doctors to agree the patient has less
than six months to live, has voluntarily
chosen to die and is capable of making
health tare decisions.

I he measure was approved by voters
in 1994, survived legal challenges, and
was re-approved in a 1997 referendum by
a wide margin.
In his directive, Ashcroft said prescrib
ing, dispensing or administering federal
ly controlled substances to assist suicide vi
olates the Controlled Substances Act,
passed by Congress in 1970 as part of the
nation's war on drug use.
Rushong argued that by applying the
act to physicians who help terminally ill
patients hasten their deaths, Ashcroft was
interpreting the CSA in a way that was not
intended by Congress.
