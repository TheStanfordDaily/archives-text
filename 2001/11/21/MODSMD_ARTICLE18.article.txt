## The 						Stanford Daily Pac-10 must find better bowl games for its teams 
### 
Published Since JS'fl

By all accounts, Stanford's football
team is having a tremendous sea
son. II it can beat Notre Dame and
San Jose State, it will finish a very
difficult schedule with an outstanding record
of 9-2. It has clinched a share of second place
in the Pacific 10 Conference and could end
up as .» co-champion. It is currently ranked
13th in both college football polls and ninth
in the Bowl Championship Series standings.
Three other Pac-10 teams (Washington,
Washington State and Oregon) have similar
records and accomplishments. With seasons
like this, they .ill deserve to play on college
football's biggest stage: a New Year's Day
bowl game.
Unfortunately, the Pac-10 has negotiated a
contract with one New Year's Dav bowl. As a

result, only the conference champion (Ore
gon (his year) plays on New Year's Day. I he
other schools are shunted off to second-rate
bowls played against mediocre opponents
during the week after Christmas, lb reward
.md showcase the best teams in the confer
ence, the Pac-10 should negotiate contracts
to place multiple teams in high-profile New
Year's Day bowl games.
This year, the non-champion Pac-10 teams
will play in the 1 loliday Bowl, the Sun Bowl,
the newly-formed Seattle Bowl and the Las
Vegas Bowl. These bowls are hardly as ap
pealing or as renowned as the Cotton Bowl
or the (iator Bowl.
They are played during the middle of the
week, while few people are thinking about
college football. The Seattle Bowl is not even

important enough to be televised on
KSPN — it is demoted to ESPN2. Ib most of
the country, the Pac-10 simply disappears
during the post-season.
Prospective football recruits use the na
tionally televised bowl games to assess the
schools for which they want to play. But with
out a Pac-10 representative in these marquee
match-ups, they may ignore Pac-10 schools
in favor of those the Midwest and the South,
which do play in these games. Without better
bowl publicity, all Pac-10 teams will find it dif
ficult to broaden their recruiting east of the
Rocky Mountains.
Some constraints are geographic. I he Pac-
I O's fans are concentrated on the West Coast,
so most of its bowl games will be located
there. A large part of a bowl game's success is.

after all, measured in tickets sold and tourist
dollars spent. But the Cotton Bowl, which is
played on New Year's Day in Dallas, would be
a natural destination fora top Pac-10 team. It
draws a high-quality opponent, it is played
on national television, it is well-known and it
is geographically feasible for Pac-10 fans to
attend the game.
It looks too late to help Stanford and
Washington State this year. They are proba
bly stuck in anonymous games against mid
dling opponents. But this year's bowl debacle
should wake up conference commissioner
Tom 1 lansen. Other conferences, such as the
Big Ten, send three teams to New Year's Day
bowls. There is no reason the Pac-10 — the
"Conference of Champions" — can't send at
least two.
