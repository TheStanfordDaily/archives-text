Thanksgiving has (hanged dra

terms of one good meal. Kven the menu has
t hanged. Ihe original Pilgrims ate wild
turkeys, fish, deer and corn meal. I bdav.we
eat tilings the Pilgrims didn't even have:
ham, sweet potatoes, cranbcrn saute and
pumpkin pie.
Governor Bradford wrote about the
1621 meal: "And besitls water foul, tlier was
great store of wild lurkies, of which lliev
took mam. hesids venison, &t. \ ou'll have

to excuse his spelling (lie
didn't have the (liance to
attend a good grammar
school). I lie Pilgrims in
\iled 90 Native Anient ans
who, being good guests
"went out and killed fine
Deere, which they
brought to the Plantation
and heft owed on our (iov-

ernour." I odav, guests bring (lowers to din
ner which are, probably. just as haul to find
in Silicon Valley.
fhe first interactions between Pilgrims
and Native Americans were skittish, uneas\
and hostile. When the Pilgrims first landed
on November I 1. 1620, they spotted five or
six Native Anient .ins who "rane awav on ve
sands as hard as they could." At a later date,
Native Americans at tat ked with <i "great &
strange crie" accompanied by arrows. 1 lie
Pilgrims fired back with muskets. I hey
thought "it pleased God to vatujiiish their
enemies." I lie winter of 1620 was hard and
half the Pilgrims died.
On March 16. 1621 they met a friendly
native named Samasett who communicat
ed in broken Hnglish and "became prof
itable to them In acquainting them with
many things concerning ye state of ye cun
try." I hesc better relations culminated in a
three-day least which we now remember as
Thanksgiving. We consider it a time of rec
onciliation and peace.
In their enthusiasm to expunge religion
from American public life, some have
claimed the 1621 meal was part of a secular
harvest festival. I find that hard to believe.
The Puritans were religious zealots. They
fled England for the Netherlands Ixvause
they "were hunted, 8c persecuted on euery
side." Later, they fled the Netherlands for
America because their children were "tend
ing to dissolutnes, 8c the danger of their
soules; to ye great greefe of their parents,
and dishonour of God."
I "lie Pilgrims interpreted everything as
the will of God. On the journey across the
Atlantic, many of them were "afflicted with
sea-sickness." A professional seaman made
fun of them and said he hoped to throw
their dead bodies overlxiard. I 'his same
mariner fell sick and passed away. The Pil
grims attributed his death to "ye lust hand

of (iod vpon him" and ( halked up the victo
rs' to "(lotls prouidence." I lie tact that 90
heathens joined them lot dinnci in 1(»21
would not ha\'e stopped the Pilgrims from
s.i\ ing tlieii pra\ei sand thanking (iod.
In 1777, the ( ontinentid (Congress is
sued a thanksgiving Proclamation stating
that it was"the indispensable l)ut\ of all
Men to adore the superintending Provi
dence oi Almight\ (iod. In 1789, George
Washington (ailed for"a da\ of publit
thanksgiving and pravei to be obsciTed In
acknowledging with grateful hearts the
main signal favors ol Alinights (iod. Abe
1 iiu oln made it an ollic ial annual holidas in
1803. I le marked it .is a "d.i\ of thanksgiv
ing and Praise loom benefit ent Father w ho

dwelleth in the I leavens."
Somewhere along the
way, this godl) focus
gave way to televised
sports, shopping and the
turkey. Ihe turkey's
been destined for fame
ever since colonial times.
Benjamin Franklin once
wrote to his daughter: " I

wish the Bald Kagle had not been chosen
as the Representative of our Coun
try! . . .The lurkey is in Comparison a
mm h more respectable Bird, and withal a
true original Native of America."
I don't think it looks very "respectable"
to sit on a dining room table with a bunch of
smiling up your butt. I hen again, Ben
Franklin was talking about a different kind
of bird: the wild turkey. Wild " 1 urkies"
could fly up to 50 miles per hour, run up to
20 miles per hour and leap tall buildings in
a single bound.
Modem-day turkeys can't even fly. That
makes them a lot easier to catch than wild
" 1 urkies." 1 hey are bred to have unblem
ished skin, whereas the wild " 1 urkies" had
speckled skin that probably caused great
consternation among Pilgrim mothers who
tried to separate the white meat from the
dark meat. Foday, most turkeys grow up in
barns and never set* the light of day.
I his perspective tomes from a domesti
cated turkey named "Bo" whom 1 asked to
co-author this portion of the column at the
inspiration of 1 wo Guys Who are Dumber
and More Boring I han You. Very few
turkeys are raised on "free ranging" turkey
farms. Instead, they roam around barns
with two square feet of space per turkey. It's
like growing upon a New York subway plat
form during rush hour.
Recently. Stanford Vegan Action passed
out literature claiming (among many other
things) that turkeys "have been bred to
grow faster and heavier but their skeletons
haven't kept pace, which causes 'cowboy
legs'... [so that] the turkeys have problems
standing and fall and are trampled on."
Fliis sounds horrible and, if it were true, it
would embarrass the proud lineage of all
those wild " I urkies." So, "Bo" and I

"Bo"
< bet ketl out the fat ts. We called the fourth
largest turkev processor in the I nited
States. It's Pilgrim's Pride Corporation in
Dallas. Texas, with annual revenues of
$2,211,712.000. The chairman's name is
Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim (no relation to the ac
tual Pilgrims or to im co-author), but he
was iK >t available to take our call.
We spoke with President CFO/All-
Around-Nice-Cu\ David Van 1 loose, who
said barns are an "ideal climate for [turkeys |
to growßarns are nice, warm and free of
predators. There's plenty of room so
tin kt-\ s aren't elbow-to-elbow (or wing-to
w ing, as it were). I asked him if turkeys had
"cowlxn legs" and he replietl, "il that were
true, we'd be losing a lot of money." Con
sumers want turkeys with intact legs. Fur
thermore, hobbled turkeys wouldn't be
able to leetl oi water themselves.
Asked if turkeys would be happier out
doors. Mr. Van I loose reflected that he
"t an't personalis en\ ision the happiness lac
toi l>\ going outside and wailing in the mud
or hot sunshine. " On the other hand, his
conipam t ares enough about turkey com
fort to budget 559 million for technology
that will tool turkevs in the summer. In el-

I at, t lit* tin keys will have air-conditioning.
It sounds like turkeys never had it so
good. They grow up indoors (like most
modern kids) and the\ selflessly give their
lives to he the centerpiece of Our holidays.
On average, Americans eat about 18
pounds of turkey per year. That's up from
eight pounds per person in 1970. l-ast
year, we had as many turkeys .is people in
this country: about 2(»7 million turkeys
were raised. Around 45 million of them
were eaten at I hanksgiving, 22 million at
Christmas and 19 million at Easter. Main
of them were exported. Turkey produc
tion has become big business in the I nit -
ed States of America.
We may never be able to judge the
happiness of a turkey. Comparing wild
"Turkies" hunted by Pilgrims to modern
day turkeys perched in air-conditioning
would be like comparing Columbia stu
dents running around New York City to
Stanford students milling about the
Farm. There's a definite trade-ofl be
tween stress and comfort. Anyone who's
watched the Batman movies will know
that its not easy to be a hero. 1 he I hanks
giving turkey understands. Through
their heroic act of self-sacrifice, today's
turkeys have become more popular than
Ben Franklin ever imagined.

Rob Cknulet eats turkey and struggles with t)u
question of whether they are truly happy creatures.
