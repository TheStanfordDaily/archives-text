Caltrain shutdown a disaster for students
Call rain is planning .1 shutdown of
weekend service for lip i<> two vcars. start
ing in April. I his will prove disastrous for
Stanford students and employees who rely
on (laltrain sen ices.
Man) Stanford students depend on Cal
train for getting to San Francisco: to plays,
dinner, bookstores, sports events, muse
ums, etc. Stanford traditions such as the
freshman scavenger hunt are also depen
dent on the service. (laltrain is the only link
for car-less students to the diversity and cul
ture of such an exciting urban center. In my
choice to attend Stanford, and I presume
that of others. Caltrain was an important
factor which mitigated our school's subur
ban location.
Additionally, many Stanford employees
are unable to afford a car and so use Cal
train to get to their jobs. For example, 1
know a number of dining hall employees
use the train to get to their weekend shifts.
Other employees choose not to drive, sav
ing energy, money and even time.
Alternative service — the Sam I rails k\
bus — is slow and unattractive. I do not l>e
lieve Stanford students will choose to ride a
bus for the more than one and one half
hours this bus requires. Caltrain may offer
its own replacement bus service, but this
will inevitably be slower and less comfort
able than the train.
l he shutdown is being conducted in
the name of track improvements for high
speed service to begin in three years.
While some sac rifice must be made for this
stej) forward, shutting down Caltrain fora
large portion of the week is not the an
swer. Last year, Caltrain completed a
major capital overhaul program with
shutdowns on only two Sundays and occa
sional minor delays. I lie work could also
be staggered, shutting down service on

only a portion of the line at a time.
Stanford should contact the Peninsula
Joint Powers Board, the agency that oper
ates Caltrain, asking that the shutdown be
reconsidered. We should also consider con
tacting elected representatives about this ill
planned shutdown. If the shutdown does
occur, the Dean of Students office should
consider reinstating its City Express bus
service in an improved form.

Security during Big Game
was inconsistent
In the scope of things this probably isn't
that big of a deal, but after making the effort
to purchase bottled drinks for the Big
Game and then having them confiscated
because I couldn't carry them all into the
stadium after removing all their caps, I felt
the Athletics Department and the Stanford
Sheriff should hear my complaint.
Big Game fans were not allowed to take
capped bottles into Stanford Stadium be
cause of fears by the Athletics Department
and the police that bottles filled with water
could be used as projectiles. I 'his required
attendees to remove bottle caps and cany
in the open drinks or to leave the drinks
outside, more often than not in a trash can.
Nowhere in any newsprint or online
source was there any information prior to
the game regarding this policy. Why
couldn't whoever is in charge of this "no
cap" policy inform fans prior to the game?
Why couldn't the unopened drinks that
would otherwise be thrown into the trash
cans be collected for distribution to one or
more of the many f<x>d closets for the
needy? How difficult would it have been
for Stanford Athletics to set aside a recepta

de to colled unopened drinks?
Once inside, vendors were selling bot
tled drinks with caps. Although the ven
dors supposedly stopped selling the bottles
with caps, there were a great number of
bottles with taps still inside the stadium,
which could have been used as potential
weapons. Stanford Athletics personnel as
well as sheriff's deputies were unable to
confiscate bottled and capped drinks inside
the stadium due to a lac k of personnel and
the large number of capped bottles in cir
culation. Many empty bottles could be
found sitting on seats and underneath
them inside Stanford Stadium. What was
the real reas< >n for collecting the bottles out
side.-' \\ as it perhaps to make more conces
sions money on the inside?
In years past oranges and bananas had
also been used as projectiles, yet these were
not being confiscated at Gate 2. Uncut fruit
was supposedly banned, but there were a
number of people inside the stadium with
uncut fruit. Again, these rules or regula
tions on banned items did not appear in
any newsprint or online source.
Posters and signs — which could be
seen being carried into the stadium by
fans and were visible from the south
end zone — should have been confis
cated or banned as well. Why can't the
Athletics Department post newly re
stricted items on its Web site and publi
cize the restrictions in press releases?
What kind of drinks (other than un
capped) are allowed into the game?
Why can't the Athletics Department be
more consistent in informing students
and fans about banned items prior to
the football games and more consistent
in confiscating banned items before and
during the games?

sional minor delays. I lie work could also
be staggered, shutting down service on

only a portion of the line at a time.
Stanford should contact the Peninsula
Joint Powers Board, the agency that oper
ates Caltrain, asking that the shutdown be
reconsidered. We should also consider con
tacting elected representatives about this ill
planned shutdown. If the shutdown does
occur, the Dean of Students office should
consider reinstating its City Express bus
service in an improved form.

Security during Big Game
was inconsistent
In the scope of things this probably isn't
that big of a deal, but after making the effort
to purchase bottled drinks for the Big
Game and then having them confiscated
because I couldn't carry them all into the
stadium after removing all their caps, I felt
the Athletics Department and the Stanford
Sheriff should hear my complaint.
Big Game fans were not allowed to take
capped bottles into Stanford Stadium be
cause of fears by the Athletics Department
and the police that bottles filled with water
could be used as projectiles. I 'his required
attendees to remove bottle caps and cany
in the open drinks or to leave the drinks
outside, more often than not in a trash can.
Nowhere in any newsprint or online
source was there any information prior to
the game regarding this policy. Why
couldn't whoever is in charge of this "no
cap" policy inform fans prior to the game?
Why couldn't the unopened drinks that
would otherwise be thrown into the trash
cans be collected for distribution to one or
more of the many f<x>d closets for the
needy? How difficult would it have been
for Stanford Athletics to set aside a recepta

de to colled unopened drinks?
Once inside, vendors were selling bot
tled drinks with caps. Although the ven
dors supposedly stopped selling the bottles
with caps, there were a great number of
bottles with taps still inside the stadium,
which could have been used as potential
weapons. Stanford Athletics personnel as
well as sheriff's deputies were unable to
confiscate bottled and capped drinks inside
the stadium due to a lac k of personnel and
the large number of capped bottles in cir
culation. Many empty bottles could be
found sitting on seats and underneath
them inside Stanford Stadium. What was
the real reas< >n for collecting the bottles out
side.-' \\ as it perhaps to make more conces
sions money on the inside?
In years past oranges and bananas had
also been used as projectiles, yet these were
not being confiscated at Gate 2. Uncut fruit
was supposedly banned, but there were a
number of people inside the stadium with
uncut fruit. Again, these rules or regula
tions on banned items did not appear in
any newsprint or online source.
Posters and signs — which could be
seen being carried into the stadium by
fans and were visible from the south
end zone — should have been confis
cated or banned as well. Why can't the
Athletics Department post newly re
stricted items on its Web site and publi
cize the restrictions in press releases?
What kind of drinks (other than un
capped) are allowed into the game?
Why can't the Athletics Department be
more consistent in informing students
and fans about banned items prior to
the football games and more consistent
in confiscating banned items before and
during the games?
