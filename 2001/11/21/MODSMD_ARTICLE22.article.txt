# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## New agreement a big step for WTO 
### SANDEEP GOPALAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
lTie World 1 rade Organization, aftet
hours ol wrangling that culminated on
Wednesday, agreed to start new rounds of
talks so as to reach agreement on a new in
ternational trade agreement l>\ 2005. Flic
ministerial talks, with delegations from 1 12
countries participating, were a complete
contrast from the previous round in Seattle
two years ago. lliat meeting had been a
mud-wrestling match, with hittci fights be
tween rich and poor countries, punctuated
by mindless vi<ilenceon the si reels ol Seattle.
l he stench of exploding tear gas shells
had brought the talks to an ignominious!)
fruitless end, raising questions about the
very viabilitv of the W I (). Mik h ofthat was
put to rest ai Doha ovei the hist week, with
the developing countries, led l>\ India,
Bra/il and South Afrit a, taking on the I S
and the Furopean Union in an attempt to
level the playing field. Siu h was their siu < ess
that the talks spilled over i<> an additional
dav in the fiice of unstinted bargaining and
sleepless delegates finalh hammered out an
acceptable solution.
Importantly, there was no cacophom of
anti-globali/ation gobbledvgook dished out
by the sell-appc )inted protectors of the poor.
I he revulsion of violence, undei .in\ guise
engendered In the horrific happenings of
Sept. 11, and the intransigence ol Qatari
visa authorities, emasculated the anarc liisis
who have made a cottage industry out of
street violence, as evidenced I>\ the ugK
sights seen in (»enoa and Seattle.
Never was momentum in the WI'O
more imperative. As economic s across the
globe reel from recession, more trade, not
less, is what the doctor ordered. Also, In
choosing to engage vigmousk with the rest
of the world, the I S. has sent a powerful
signal that glohali/ation was not slaughtered
by terrorism.
I lie Doha round will be remembered
not just l>\ corporate coteries. Poor patients

ranging from 111 \ -ravaged Africa to an
thrax-attacked America will have much to
rejoice. B\ crafting a Public Health excep
tion to the 1 racle Related Intellectual Prop
ert\ Rights regime (TRIPS), the lloodgates
lor cheap generic drugs have been opened.
I he impact that generic drugs c an have
on prices was seen even in the I S. Anthrax
drug costs plunged when the government
sought to import them from countries
w hose proc ess patent regimes allowed their
manufacture in defiance of product patents
held In pharmaceutical giants.
Differences, however, persist on the
thorny issue of farm subsidies, made even
more complicated In the political pressures
of the French presidential elections, imple
mentation asMiinietries from the I ruguay
round, textile import quotas, environmen
tal protection concerns and anti-dumping
measures adopted In developed countries.
I he disc ussions had nearly collapsed on
whether the "Singapore Issues", rules pro
tec ling investment, competition polio and
government procurement, should be in
cluded in farm subsidies. Developing coun
tries argued that until implementation ol
previous guarantees made In the W est, ii is
ludicrous to enlarge the agenda b\ taking
on new areas.
For once, their concerns were not dis
missed. I his alone must mark the coming of
age ol the WI'O. For years, il has been
branded a neo-colonialist bastard child of
the developed world, with one purpose: to
make the rich ric her and the poor poorer.
So hideous is the animal, that even jabber
ing pop star, putative peasant and the odd
hippie thrown in for good measure, has
Hogged it like the proverbial horse. I his
year's Nobel Pri/c winner for economics.
|oseph Stiglit/, has gone on record to say
that I S.-ied decisions were dictated In
"selfish spec ial interests" and slammed the
WI'O for pushing developing countries to
accept agreements "with a gun to their
heads."
