## Moon, macular degeneration and Meave Leakey all make news

The Moon: inspiration for poets,
symbol for lovers and . . . ehild of the
violent impact of a planet on Earth. In

Of the myriad strategies to fight can
cer, stopping blood supply to tumors
seems to be the most promising. In a

study published recentlx in Nature, scien
tists introduced tumors in mutant rats un
able to create new blood vessels. I lie Ill
inois soon died, "asphyxiated' from lack
ol blood. I he results corroborate ex idenc e
from other research, xvhit.h was succ esslul
in eliminating c aiuer in 42 percent ol ani
mals alter disrupting blood supplx. 1 11 hu
mans, the process foc uses on disrupting
angiogenesis, or capillary regeneration.
Angiogenesis has been researched 101 the
past two decades, and the lii si anti-angio
genic drug was introduced in 1992. Mow
ever, there are economic hurdles to pro
ducing these drugs in large quantities at
ac (essible prices.
You don't need to have taken the
Mumßio core to know that vision de
generates with age. One of the principal
xillains is macular degeneration, a disor
der that c auses loss of spec ialized colls in
the retina that assist photoreceptoi neu
rons. Age-related maculai degeneration
a!Ilu Is nearlx two million Americans, m
< hiding live percent ol those over (>() and
20 percent oxer SO. Drs. Nathans and
Sun ol Johns I lopkins have been target
ing the protein A2L, xvhich seems to ac -
c mutilate in the eve and destrox the spe
cialized cells. Ibex have also found .1 ge

netic component to the disease. At pre
sent, heating the damaged area to de
stroy the diseased cells — usually
through laser therapy — is the best treat
ment, but is expensive and risky. Slowing
the progress ol the disease is a safer pro
cedure, according to (he scientists.

A Leakey attain makes headlines. Meave
Lcakcv announced earlier this year the
<lis< ovei \ ol .1 new hominicl species, which
she dubbed .is Krnwnlhrofms />l<itypos. I lie
tossil is dillercnt from the Australopithe
< us .iiid the later I lomo genus, whit h gave
rise to oui sj)( (ic's. || Leakey is correct it

could prove the existence of two dis

tinct hominid lineages ,'Lf> mil

lion years ago. I he possibility
that llomo may well de

scend from Kenyanthro
pus and not Australopithe
cus has upset the anthro
pological communitx.

Leakey is currently digging
for further evidence, in search

of more remains of her nexv hominid,
and perhaps will be able to shed tnc>re light
on when we became two-legged.

While a cure for AIDS seems elusive
and treatment is difficult, progress ad
vances on the prevention front. 11IV re
moves cholesterol-rich lipids front inlet ted
cells. Researchers have found that the virus
uses these lilts, in essence, as a rati. So
would removing cholesterol from our bod
ies eliminate I1IY? I'robablx not, but a
cream containing cholesterol stripper
could prevent viral transmission during
sex. In a preliminary experiment xx it 11
mice, published in "AIDS Research and
Human Retroviruses," such a chemical
condom xvas lountl to be 90 percent cflec
tive. Do not expect such a product in mar
ket any time soon: c linical trials on humans
are years axvay.

In (he

past 50 years,

the greatest witness of naval buildup has
been (he sea itself. Noise levels undersea
have im t eased In as mm h as 10 dec ibels,
thanks latgeh to shipping and seismic ex
plorations. 1 he I .S. Navv is currently test
ing a more powerful low frequency sonar.
At lower frequencies, targets can he detec t
ed at mm li hit titer distances. Whether the
noise bothers marine animal communica
tions has been inconclusive. Studies have
seen dolphins ( hange their path by a lew
hundred leet, and sometimes not change
,it all. Some biologists, using terrestrial ani
mals as examples, claim that loud noise can
lead to hentori luges and even death. ()tli
ers argue that whales and dolphins must
have developed noise-filtering techniques
th.it allow them to ignore background
noise — just as humans do.
