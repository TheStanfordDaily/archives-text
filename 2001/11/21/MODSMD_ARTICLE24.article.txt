According lo Dr. (ierald SilverlxTg,
most experts Ix'lieve the buildup ol b
imyloitl. .i protein that is produced iu
neailn even (ill in the both , is the cause
»l \l/heiinei's diseast within the brain.

ilisiupts signal transmissions within the

svmptomsof \ 1 /I leinici's patients: meni

I lie idea lo slow down, or even ar
rest, the progression of Alzheimer's was
based on the obset\alion that in aging,

and to a greatei degree in Al/heiinei's.
there is a decrease in s|)iual fluid pro
duction and iui nover that could lead i< >
a I »iilit 111p t >1 b-ainvloid. \lso,a percent
age ol patients with hydrocephalus, a
disease characterized bv an inabilitv to
absorb spinal fluid alter ii is made, show
evident eol Alzheimer's disease tin brain
biopsies. It was postulated that the
buildup ol the protein h-amyloid, the
apparent cause ol Alzheimer's Disease,
ma) be due lo the poor circulation <>l
spinal fluid.
I he solution to I his problem was to
increase the turnovei of fluid within
the brain to essentially wash the lo\ii
protein from the brain. Dr. Silvei berg
and I mil Saul, head engineei at
lumoe, actoniplished ibis slow lluid
tin nt)ver b\ developing a vai iation on a
common implantable neurological
shunt used for hydrocephalus ihat
drains cerebrospinal fluid from the
braiti and into the abdominal <a\H\
through two catheters connected to a
flow control valve.
Although this thought apjxurnl to Ite
t|uite ingenious with relativeh few usks.it was
t >rigin. illyt (>i isit lei xx I tt x > rat lied for tl ic at ad
en lit community. "\ ou m.i\ ask win stall a
tompamr" Dr. Silvedx-ig iiujiliixxi. "Win
not just doanauideiuit stutly? W ell the an
sw tt to tJiat is we liied, but none ol the usual
luntling agendo weir interested I have to
admit il someone tame to me with an idea
withnoilataonvsults, 1 wouldprolubk turn

lliemtlt minis well."
II the idea was too risky loi theacatl
ei 1 1community how did they come tip
with funding I'm in private investors,
wlit) are usualK very selective about
their risks?
"\likli ol it conies down to sell
preservation," Silverliergsaid."Many t)l
oili investoi s are senior t iti/ens and very
t out ei net! about tlicit own health in tlie
years to t onie. Hut on top ol that, there
is a huge market with really no effective
treatments. I here are some drugs that
have show n some short term improve
ments lor about six months, but their ef
fectiveness tapers off."
C an 1 unoe's shunt system real I v re
verse the signs of Alzheimer's? Dr. Sil
vcrl>crg sa\s that the goal is inainU to
stop the |)rogressit)n, and in the few
cases where a patient improves, the in
flammation and protein tangles instigat
ed l>\ the harmful b-amyloitl protein
have not vet caused < ell death.
"Neurons which have already died
can not be regenerated," said Dr. Silver
berg. "But with imaging techniques
siu h as volumetric MRI, it is possible to
detect those in the earb stages of
Alzheimer's Disease, prior to severe
memory loss. Therefore, we hope to
stop the problem belorc it becomes clin
icalb significant."
1-unoe's shunt system emits a slow
but constant drainage of cere
brospinal fluid. It operates by ton

netting ,i catheter placed in the area ol
the brain where spinal fluid is pro
dut etl through a flow regulating valve
to a catheter that runs down the chest
of the patient. I his connecting
catheter runs just beneath the skin to
the abdomen. 1 lie idea is that the
harmful b-amyloid protein will drain
to the abdomen to be naturally re
moved, instead of accumulating in the
brain and subsequently leading to
damaged neural networks.
Fortunately. Dr. Silverberg's post il
lation appears promising, as Kunoc's
initial pilot stuck ol about M patients
had good results. Most ol the patients
had a stabilization of memor\ loss, and
a few even improved.
Dr. Silverberg's belief, which corre
lates with early results, is that as fluid
drains, the brain will respond b\ pro
ducing more fluid to maintain appro
priate physiological levels. However, a
nun h larger and controlled study is nec
essary tt> verify the early findings, and is
currently beginning at 25 hospitals with
approximately 2f)f> patients.
I lopefully, this study will prove the ef
fectiveness of I- unoe's device, leading to
I DA approval. Although much investi
gation and analysis remains, many art
looking for Lunoe to bring the promise
that was stated by Dante, about the river
of "good memoiy" years ago: "But 10,
w here Kunoe flow s! I x\id thither, and as
thou art wont, revive 1 lis tainting virtue."
