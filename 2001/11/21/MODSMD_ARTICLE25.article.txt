# DirecTV + Echostar = monopoly?

### KALPANA SRINIVASAN 
My dad
is not the roll
over-and-get-
r ip p e d - of I
type, but I still
knew things
were bad
when he

called tin- and dec lared he was done with cable tele
vision. l itiiio. No more. He was tired of the soaring
hills, unwanted c hannelsand poor customer service.
I lo wanted something better, and it came in a device
(lie si/c< of ;i large pi/za: the satellite dish.
Millions of Americans, once at the mercy of cable
monopolies, have relished in the ability to choose
their programming provider. They have embraced
satellite I V for its spoils packages, clear pictures and
competitive pricing. Now, the nation's two largest
satellite TV companies — DirecTV and Echo Star —
want to become one.
I lie two providers control the vast majority of
the market for satellite TV service. Together, they
would have 16.7 million subscribers, ontsizing
even the nation's largest cable companies. Sure,
the new combined satellite TV giant could put up
stiff competition for cable companies in big mar
kets. But is ii really, that much better to have two
schoolyard bullies, instead of one, on the television
playground?
In making their pitch to the government, which
needs to approve the deal, the executives said the
mat ket should not be viewed as one for satellite TV
services alone. Rather, the parameters should be
drawn more broadly to cover all video programming

services, including cable television. That would make
the combined satellite I V company's share ol'the
market much smaller.
Their basic reasoning is that someone like my dad
still has a choice: he can choose between his one local
cable or one satellite company. But he no longer will
be able to pick between two satellite I V companies
ottering different packages lor programming. One
less company offering a platform to distribute ton
tent could make it even harder for new channels to
reach consumers and could diminish the opportuni
ties to bring greater program diversity to viewers.
And even though satellite and cable companies in
the same markets would compete for customers, the
added potential for satellite companies to battle each
other — say, by ottering specials on installation or
discounts on dishes through certain retailers —
would disappear. 1 hat would make satellite TV
more like cable companies, which typically don't
compete with each other but instead offer exclusive
service in their territory. In the limited markets
where two cable companies do compete head-on,
consumers generally see significant differences in
their rates or package options, litis type of rivalry
among satellite providers, which exists today to the
benefit of consumers, would be lost by such a deal.
But the most profound impact of the merger
would be in rural areas, many of which are not
served by cable companies at all. Satellite, with its
ability to cover even the most remote pockets of the
nation, makes it possible fora greater number of
homes to get a variety of TV channels. In fact, some
areas couldn't even pick up their local 'IV stations
until satellite providers were allowed to beam the
signals to those homes.
For those Americans, an Echostar-DirecTV com
bination really would create a monopoly—their only
choice for video programming and potentially for

the high-speed Internet service that the combined
satellite company says it wants to offer more broadly.
(-able and phone companies also offer fast Web con
nections, but their services often don't reach rural
customers. Consumer groups already are worried
that the satellite TV merger will mean huge price in
creases in rural markets, although company execu
tives say they will institute some safeguards to keep
costs in check.
Further entrenching the now-standard line for
two big communications companies seeking to
merge, DirecTV and Echostar promise that their
marriage will help the country close the "digital di
vide." In this case, the providers say they can har
ness their size and shared resources to deliver high
speed Internet access via satellite to homes across
the nation.
It's an argument that phone, cable and wireless
companies seeking to merge in recent years have
made to the government, knowing that such services
are a priority for rural lawmakers and communica
tions officials. Hut many companies that make this
pledge either can really offer the service as two sepa
rate competitive companies, or aren't in a hurry to
get services out to rural markets. Pledges to roll out
Internet access nationwide are rarely enforceable
and companies are rarely held to task tor failure to
live up to their word.
In the end, satellite TV — the upstart service that
won over millions of customers — may start looking
a lot like those big cable behemoths that it sought to
overtake. It won't face competition from "one of its
own" in most markets. In some places, it won't face
any competition at all. Once that happens, 1 might as
well poise myself next to the phone to await the in
evitable: a call from my dad telling me he is done with
satellite I*V. But then again, he will have nowhere
else to go.
