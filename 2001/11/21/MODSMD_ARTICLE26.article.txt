Believe it or not,
one of the main
reasons that fuel
cell tars have yet
to hit the market
is the lack of hy
drogen tanking
stations. General
Motors engineers
have found an in
novative solution
to this problem: a
catalytic device

that strips hydrogen from regular gasoline, al
lowing drivers to (ill up at their local filling sta
tion. Although not as efficient as pure hydrogen,
it produces 50 percent better fuel economy. The
catalytic .converter was demonstrated in a proto
type Chevy S-10 this year.

If you're looking
fora way to stand
out among the
throng of surfers
on the waves,
I'owerSki Jet
board may be the
perfect answer.
Power Ski has at
tached a 40-
horsepower, 40-
pound watercraft
engine into the
back of a conven-

tional surfboard to create the world's first motor
ized surfboard. It will not onl\ let you get on top
of the largest waves, but it is also perfect for when
the surf is down. The Jetboard is set to be released
next June. Projected price: about $0,000.

Ever dream of
owning one of
those German au
tomotive dream
machines? Now
may be your
chance...if you're
into skating.

BMW's new Streetcarver skateboard borrows its
steering mechanism from the original 5 Series,
which makes the board perfect for high-speed
cruising and carving., Oversize wheels that pro
trude from the chassis like claws give the Street
carver the road grip of a high-performance sport
sedan. And at just $495, it may even be within
your budget.

IBM recently
unveiled its T220
LCD monitor,
touted as the
world's sharpest
display. The 22-
inch screen has a
resolution of
3,840 by 2,400
pixels, leaving
typical high-end
monitors —

which deliver images at 1.280 bv 1.024 pixels —
in the dust. Images on the T220 are so sharp that
looking at a complex image through a magnifying
glass reveals details that are not visible with the
naked eye. The price: a whopping $15,999.
