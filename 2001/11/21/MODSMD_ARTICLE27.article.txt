On Sept. 7, in the Cardinal's
third game of the year, Stanford de
feated I exas A&M 4-2 in College
Station, Fexas. Nearly three
months later, the two will meet
again this Frida\ night at New Mol

Fliis time the stakes are much
higher; the teams are squaring oil
in the third round of the NCAA
Women's College Cup. And this
time the No. 8 Aggies (1(>-;M) will
have to travel to the Farm.
I'he match earlier this season
featured a Stanford squad in the
midst of defining itself as an elite
team with a dominating offensive

attack.
"We played them very early, so
we are probabb both different
teams," said Stanford head coach
Andy Nelson "4'hey are on a roll
and playing very well. Fliey are
very solid all over the field, without
any blaring weaknesses."
So what's changed siiu e Septem

Most apparently, the country's
expectations for fifth-seeded Stan
ford (15-.V2). Hie Cardinal entered
the season ranked No. 1"> in the na
tion, tabbed to finish a dismal fourth
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Now, after climbing the ranks
and finishing one goal short of the
Pac-10 title, Stanford's capabilities
are well known.
"With the higher ranking we're
not going to sneak up on anyone,
anymore," said sophomore for
ward Marcie Ward. "There's a little
extra pressure in not being the un
derdog, but 1 think that we can deal
with that."
