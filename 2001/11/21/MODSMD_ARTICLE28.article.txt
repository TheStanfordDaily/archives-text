MEN S BASKETBALL
No. 14 Stanford 81, Southern
Utah 63.

I'he I hunderbirds hung
tough <iihl played a defense that
had Casev |acobsen shaking his
head, coach Mike Montgomen
slanuning tlie scorer's table and
the Sixth Man staving tor the en
lire game.
Uut afterwards, Montgomen
and Ins players did not have
main complaints about the Car
dinal's effort.
"Ii was a good win. It was a
good basketball team," Mont
gomen said of the 1 hunderbirds.
"But I didn't quite know that thc\
were going to be that good."
Southern I tali fought against
an nnexpectedh noisy arena, with
tour new starters, a center that was
only 6-fbot-9 and a zone defense
that gave the C lardinal tits.
"Ii was ven frustrating, espe
cially at (he start," said senior
point guard 1 on\ Ciovacchini,
who finished v\ it 1 i eight assists and
only two turnovers. "We hadn't
seen anything like that in .is long
as I can remember. I hey played
|the zone| realh, really well. It was
a curveball they threw at us."
1 he rhunderbirds got as close
as 10 twice in the second half. A H
pointer by Donnie Jackson with
S: 10 to pla\ cut the Cardinal lead
to 69-59.
Freshman Josh Childress, who

finished with 13 points and nine
boards, kept the Cardinal ahead
b\ a double-digit margin with two
3-pointers in the final three'min
utes of the game.
C.asey Jacobsen was limited to
five ol 15 shooting on the night,
but still managed to lead Stanford
with 23 points. 1 le missed his first
five shots and was held without a
point for the first 15 minutes ol
the game.
When he finally made his first
field goal with 4:21 in the first
half, a 3-pointer that gave Stan
ford a 31-25 lead, Jacobsen
pumped his fist and took long
sigh of relief .
"It was a good learning experi
ence for me," |acobsen said.
"Whenever I got the ball, I had
five guys looking at me. They also
trapped a lot and shot the gaps
well, li was a good /one."
Of course, at this stage of the
season, with a young team, and
with top-10 teams such as I Clâ€ž\,
KenttK k\. Kansas and St. Joseph's
dropping games to schools like
Western Kentucky, Kastern
Washington and ball State, the
victory still means something.
Not to sav that it was pretty.
Dan Beits, the I hunderbirds'
lone returning starter, provided
most of Southern I tab's offense,
scoring 15 of the team's 31 points
in the fii st half, in<hiding t luce 3-
pointers. Bens finished with a
game-high 23 points.
Basically, after the Cardinal
paid tribute to its fans In wearing
Sixth Man 1 -shirts in pre-ganie
warm-ups, it did little else in the
first 12 minutes of the game to
show its applet iation.
But then it happened. With
8:20 to go in the first half, (liovac
chini found sophomore forward
Justin Davis i mining up the base
line and connected fora perfect
alley-oop. 1 hen Davis found
freshman center Rob Little fora
slam of his own. And then, Cio
vact hitii found junior center Cur
tis Borchardt inside the key for

one more two-handed slam that
sparked the Cardinal and extend
ed its lead to 27-22.
Similar to Saturday's game
against New Mexico, the (lardinal
ended the first half with a run,
outscoring Southern I tali 1 <>-(> to
lake a 4.^-31 halftime lead.

Borchardt is (juit kly erasing
doubts about Stanford's inside
game. Following up a 17 point. 1 1
rebound performance at New
Mexico, the oft-injured big man
bruised bis way to another dou
ble-double with IT) points and 1 1
rebounds.
