Saturday: No. 14 Stanford at Conseco
Fieldhouse vs. Purdue, 4:30 p.m., Indi

In fact, Stanford and Purdue don't really have
anything in common, other than the fact that
they'll both be in Indianapolis on Saturday
evening competing in the Wooden (.lassie, an an
nual tribute to basketball's adored living legend,
former UCLA head coach John Wooden.
Purdue is a team that's looking to improve off
of a dismal 2000 season. I lowever, last year's per
formance may be deceiving.
Hie Boilermakers were 13-0 last season and
heading toward a ninth consecutive Big Ten
Conference title when disaster struck and for

ward Rodney Smith and center John Allison
were both sidelined with foot injuries.
Purdue went on to win only one of its next
eight games and narrowh qualified for the N1 I .
Hi is year, Smith and Allison are bat k for their
senior seasons, allowing Purdue to match up on
the inside with most teams in their conference.
I his tandem might present a problem for the
Cardinal, whose inside game still remains ques
tionable.
Stanford and Purdue have not met since the
thrilling 1997-1908 NCAA Midwest Regional
semifinal which sent the Cardinal on its way to the
Final Four.
Indianapolis is termed as a neutral site for the
John Wooden Classic, but Stanford head coach
Mike MonlgonieiA is skeptic al.
"li s,it tilt*< onseco( .enier in In

Monigoinei \ said. "It w ill In*a great
