Spirtos and Margolis argued
that Shuer had implied thev were

statements were true or represent-

Ed matters of Opinion that didn't

Spirtos and Margolis intend to ap
peal the decision. However,

The controversy over tlie
Ne/hat brothers, which stems
from two medical journal articles
they wrote in 1991 and 1992 that
were later retracted, is still cur

side panel, according to the Mer
cury News.
Earlier investigations con
ducted by the hospital had
cleared the Nezhats of the ac c u
sations, but Sliuer told the Stan
ford Daily last April th.it the new
investigation was "just to make
sure" that there was "no basis for
the allegations."
