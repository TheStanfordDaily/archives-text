Some of lis arc going home for Thanksgiving,
some of us are going to friends and some ol ns are
going to Tresidder. And then there's the women's
basketball team. They're going to I lawaii.
The No. 7 Cardinal heads to the Asahi Rainbow
YVahine (Classic in Honolulu, I lawaii, iliis weekend,
looking to bring back its second conscculive tourna
ment championship of the season.
Stanford begins the tournament on Friday
against Minnesota and will look to continue to play
strong, aggressive basketball.
weekend the Cardinal won the Stanford In
vitational after defeating UC-Santa Barbara in the fi
nals 87-(>4. 1 hat game saw impressive play from all
of Stanford's healthy players and demonstrated the
Cardinal's depth.
Penn State and Oklahoma State are among the
possible opponents Stanford could face this week
end. While Stanford is the only ranked team par
ticipating in the tournament, the other schools are
NCAA Tournament contenders and will not be
easy wins.
Once more, Stanford will play without sopho
more point guard Susan King, who is still out with
knee problems. However, the freshmen tandem of
Sebnem Kimyacioglu and kelley Suminski demon
strated uncanny poise during their collegiate debuts
at the point and should continue to run the (Cardinal

ollense effectively in 1 lawaii.
Meanwhile, senior Lindsey Yamasaki's offensive
talents should help spark some impressive play this
weekend. Named Most Valuable I'layer of the Stan
ford Invitational, Yamasaki will need to join fellow
senior starters Cori Knghusen and Enjoli Izidor in
providing leadership on the court.
Sophomore Nicole Powell will be looking for big
plays this weekend, too, as she comes off a tourna
ment th.it landed her in the Cardinal record books
with her second collegiate triple-double.
Seniors Bethany Donaphin, who joined Powell
and Y amasaki on the All-Tournament team, and
Ixiuren St. Clair, who scored 15 points against Santa
Barbara, will be needed off the bench.
Also being counted on to make contributions
are sophomore Katie Denny and freshmen Azella
Perryman and I 'Nae Thiel, whose impressive
opening performances helped win the Stanford
Invitational.
Although Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Dervecr found few faults with her team's opening
games at Maples, she said defensive improvement
is critical.
"We need to work on not stopping the clock so
much, not fouling, and not getting people into foul
trouble," VanDcrvcer said.
Stanford has games on Friday, Saturday and, if all
goes well for the favored Cardinal, the champi
onship game on Sunday before returning home to
prepare for San Francisco next Wednesday.
