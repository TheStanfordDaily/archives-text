Rising above a preseason prediction of third place

team clawed its way to its first-ever Pac-1() Champi
onship last weekend.

Sunday: N0.3 Stanford vs. California or Santa
Clara, 1 p.m., New Moloney Field

The team now faces a similar challenge — only on a
much larger scale. It enters the 48-team NCAA Tour
nament seeded a familiar No. 3 in the nation.
This time around, however, the Cardinal (1 (»-1 -1
overall, 6-1-1 Pac-10) has no room for error. Unlike
the regular season — when the team lost its confer
ence opener to UCLA but was still able to claim the
league title — the NCAA Tournament is single elim
ination.
And this time, Stanford won't have junior striker
Roger Levesque.
The Pac-10 Player of the Year led the team with 10
goals and nine assists iti 18 games. But, after picking
up a red card in the Cardinal's 3-1 season-ending vic
tory over Oregon State on Sunday, Levesque must sit
out Stanford's next game. He is expected to return
next weekend, if the Cardinal advances in the tour
nament.

season knowing that we might not In- able to lose an-
