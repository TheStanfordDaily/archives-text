With just eight Pac-10 losses so for this year, the powerful prognosticator plans to punctuate the

that means he finally is forced to pick Cal to win a game, so be it.

45 17 The No. 2 Huskers should have little trouble in making the Buffaloes upset hopes ex-
tinct. Erie Crouch is the complete package, lie can run, throw when he needs to, ond boy
can he run. The super seer thinks that in o year like this, with no crystal clear Heisman
frontrunner, the trophy should go to the player who wins ond Crouch, more than any
other, has done what it takes to win this season. Nebraska will try to win their 10th

With just eight Pac-10 losses so for this year, the powerful prognosticator plans to punctuate the
conference season in o way he has not yet been able to — by going undefeated this week And if
that means he finally is forced to pick Cal to win a game, so be it.

45 17 The No. 2 Huskers should have little trouble in making the Buffaloes upset hopes ex-
tinct. Erie Crouch is the complete package, lie can run, throw when he needs to, ond boy
can he run. The super seer thinks that in o year like this, with no crystal clear Heisman
frontrunner, the trophy should go to the player who wins ond Crouch, more than any
other, has done what it takes to win this season. Nebraska will try to win their 10th
straight over No. 14 Colorado.
