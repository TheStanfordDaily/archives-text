When Vice Provost and Dean
<>l l''reslunan-Sophomore Col
lege John Bravman was a Stan
lord undergraduate in the
19705, he never went home for
I h.mksgiving.
"New York was too tar," he
said. Instead he spent the holi
day working as a hasher at
Wilbur Dining.
Bui since Ft oSoCo started in
1999, Bravman has made sure
every one of its students has a
plat e to go lor I hanksgiving:
his home.

Last vear 47 students piled
into the living room at I J-"> Santa
Teresa Lane, just across from
Sterling Quad — where I roSo-
Clo residents live. I Ins year, 54
students have signed up.
I here will he < ranberry
sauce, sweet potatoes and stufl

made when hew as growing up,
Bravman said. I here will also In*
two turkeys, one for each oven,
and a hone\ baked ham. And for
dessert — pumpkin, custard
<md apple pies.
But here's the kicker: he's
making it all himself.
Even the whipped ( ream.
"Students [last year] said,
'What is this stull? " Bravman
recalled. "I said, ' I hat's real
whipped cream, that's what it's
supposed to taste like.

Thanksgiving spread he will be serving to FroSoCo students tomorrow.
lit* sent out invitations four
weeks ago. He stockpiled tlie
kitchen with food and parked
crates of Maitinelli's cider in the
garage.
I he l)ail\ trailed along Monday
night when Hravmau went shop
ping at Andronico's Market — his
fourth time this week — and filled
two more carts.
Customers turned to stare at
the 14 bottles of Perrier bottled
water and 10 bags of bread
crumbs for stuffing, They looked
at Bravman's 6'6" frame, then
back at the cart.
"I get weird looks," said Brav
man. "People ask, 'Feeling hun
gry tonight?' "
He stopped for red apples and
bagged t ranberries, celery and as
paragus. Milk and cream were
next. He ignored the Redi-Whip
and pulled out his list.
Bottles of dressing, ('heck.
Walnuts. (-heck.
Mandarin oranges and blue
cheese for salad. Double check.
1 hen he whizzed through the
checkout, packed the trunk and

drove home. Hie whole trip took
less than an hour.
Cooking and hosting 'I'hanks
giving dinner, however, will take
22 hours. I he looking will begin at
5 a.m. tomorrow, Bravman said.
When students arrive, they'll see
reel and gold china at every table.
"I don't want them to eat on
paper plates," Bravman s.iid.
"1 want them to feel like
they're .it home," he added.
"1 want them to be in my home,
to cook for them and to serve
them," Bravman continued.
"We're .ill in this education busi
ness together."
Bravman said that's the mes
sage of FroSoCo: bringing stu
dents and faculty together.
And students at the college
agree.
"1 expec ted | FroSo( '.<>] to he a re
ally academic, boring college thing,
but it ended up being not that," said
sophomore Nathalie Cassidy.
She plans to go to the dinner to
morrow and said most students have
already been to Bravman's house.
1 le holds a barbecue every Fri
day in the autumn and spring,
and this year he hosted a pre-Big
Came gathering. And there was
that study break where he made
2(i pies.

Bravman is known for driving
FroSoCo residents to the airport,
helping them set lip their rooms
and lending out DVDs in his toi
let lion, students said.
"lie's one of the busiest people
on c ampus, hut he still makes time,
at the end of the day, for the 'little'
things," said senior Shad Ahmed, a
college assistant in Adams.
I his Thanksgiving, Bravman
plans to build a lire and watch foot
ball on his big screen television.
Students will pile into the living
room lined with books and DVDs.
"It's nice to be in a house after
living in a dorm," said sophomore
Robin Burns. It was too far to go
home to Hawaii, so she went to
Bravman's dinner last year.
"There were a lot of people, and
it was very different than the quiet
halls in the dorm," she said.
The man whose door sign reads
"John BA D. (Bad Ass Dean)'
Bravman" will spend most of his
time peeling potatoes and baking
pies tomorrow.
Everything was made from
scratch when he grew up in New
York City, he said, and he plans to
follow that tradition with every
thing short of East Coast weather.
"That's the one thing I can't
do," he said. "I can't make snow."
