# Med School prof sells strip clubs
## Stertzer purchased clubs with intent to fund medical research; negative publicity pushes him to make sales 
### GEORGE K. TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Medical School Prof. Simon Stertzer, .1
pioneer in balloon angioplasty, recently sold three
strip clubs thai he originally pure based to help fund
his research.
I he decision to sell them was based on negative
publicity Stcrt/er has received from both the I niver
sity and the private sector since he at quired the 1 lubs
in September.
" I he public polcmic continues to engender such
an unseemly characterization of the plan that my at
torneys and I have elected to abandon the idea of
funding researc hin thi> manner," Stertzer said.
Stertzer's attorney, Mark Nicoletti, vividly recalled
the negative public ity.
"112 lewent in with really great intentions, and every
one made a really big deal out of nothing." Nicoletti
told the Mercury News last week. "I think |Stertzer
had] just had enough."
According to Stertzer, the strip clubs were pur
chased because they had high potential for generat
ing profits.
"j I hey were] productive of larger cash flows than
most real property returns," he said.
I he revenues generated from the nightclubs were
to be applied to Stertzer's continuing heart research.
Stertzer had already made a mark in his field in 1978
by being the first ever to perform coronary angioplas
ty, a procedure that uses mini-balloons to repair or re
place damaged blood vessels.

Although proceeds from the nightclubs were main
ly dedicated to Stertzer's heart research, thex were also
intended for philanthropic support to Stanford.
"| 111 is | business transaction was designed, in some
part, to provide c haritable funds," Stertzer said.
I he plan to fund research using the sex industry
was not only unusual in the eyes of Stanford affili
ates, but also new to representatives of national med
ical organizations.
"I've never heard of anything like this," I ony
Mazzaschi, associate vice president for research at
the Association of American Medical Colleges, told
the Seattle I imes last month in reference to
Stertzer's purchases.
Although Stertzer owned the clubs, he distanced
himself from them by noting he had no responsibility
for their daily operations.
"I would never be involved in the day to [day] man
agement of the business," he said.
The strip clubs, all located on the lucrative Las
Vegas Boulevard, included the Palomino (Hub and
two other adjoining clubs. 1 hey were purchased
through Stertzer's holding company, whose assets in
clude- medical device startups and real estate.
Senior Becky Wong, a biology major, said that al
though this was an unconventional way to obtain
funding, the life-saving research that it helped to fund
justifies the decision.
"I think it's questionable that he used strip clubs to
fund his research," she said.
"But if my family were in a position to benefit from
his discoveries, I wouldn't refuse them just because of
how they were funded," she continued.
Stertzer said he will employ more traditional
means of financing his research from now on.
"(I will] attempt to procure research funding in the
more conventional commercial fashion than |I| have
utilized in the past," he said.
