Stress is a normal part of
everyday living, and can
be caused by either positive or
negative events. It becomes a
problem when it interferes
with your sense of 'well-being
and affects your ability to be
productive.
Symptoms of Stress
When you are under stress, you
may:
■ Feel worried or anxious
■ Have difficulty concentrating
■ Suffer from insomnia
■ Feel on edge or fearful
■ Be unable to relax
■ Feel jittery, jumpy, or restless
■ Be irritable or impatient
■ Feel dizzy
■ Have an upset stomach
■ Have diarrhea or urinate
frequently
■ Sweat a lot
■ Have cold or clammy hands
■ Experience hot or cold spells
■ Notice unexplained body
aches
■ Have a dry mouth
■ Feel tingling in your hands
or feet
■ Have a pounding or racing
heart
Feeling tense, uptight, or
overloaded? Stanford students
in the past got overloaded
too, but they had to cope
without stress tips from
Cowell.
What's Happening
Your stress response (also
known as the "fight-or-flight
response") is triggered by a
threat. Your body responds
automatically to this threat,
whether it's real or imagined.
The physical response can
include surging hormones and
nerve signals, an increase in
heart rate, breathing, blood
pressure and metabolism.
Effects of Stress
When stress levels remain too
high for too long, there can be
consequences. These may
include lowered immunity
(which may lead to infectious
illness), worsening asthma, and
stomach ulcers. Your thoughts,
feelings, and moods have a
significant impact on your
health. Your mind can
contribute to the harm of stress
or it can be part of the cure.
What to Do
■ Recognize the source of the
stress that is upsetting you
■ You may not be able to
change the source of stress,
so try to change the way
you respond to it
■ Exercise has effects on brain
chemistry that help reduce
stress, so exercise at least
three times a week
■ Focus on the present (do not
brood about the past or
worrv about the future)
■ Deal with things one at a
time
■ Occupy yourself and your
mind by being more social
■ Get enough sleep
■ Eat small amounts of high
qualitv food throughout the
day
■ Limit your intake of
caffeinated beverages and
alcohol
■ Drink water (4 to 8 glasses a
day)
■ Seek professional help for
dealing with especially
stressful events (a
professional can help you to
understand the stress, and
ways to cope with it)
■ Remember, seeking help is
not a sign of weakness; it is
the intelligent way to take
care of yourself Q
