# Amidst protests, ACT clones human embryos

BOS TON (AP) â€” A research company re
ported yesterday it had cloned the first human
embryo, a development it said was aimed at pro
ducing genetically matched replacement cells
for patients with a wide range of diseases.
But the news from Advanced Cell Technol
ogy ol Worcester, Mass., drew swift protests
from religious and political leaders who saw it
as <1 step toward cloning human beings.
Several states, including California, have
banned human cloning, and Congress is con
sidering such a ban. But company officials in
sisted their work is the first step in providing
hope for people with spinal injuries, heart <lis
ease and other ailments.
" These are exciting preliminary results,
said Dr. Robert P. oneof'the researchers
at Advanced Cell Technology. " I Ins work sets
the stage for human therapeutic cloning as a
potentially limitless source of immune-compal
ible cells lor tissue engineering and transplan
tation medicine."
Tan/a and the company's top executive
Mil had West said the\ had no interest in trans
planting such early embrvos into a woman's
womb to give birth to a cloned human being,
nor was it clear that their embryo would be ca
pable of that.
But the Washington D.C.-based National

Right to I lie ( ominittee wasted little time \es
tcrda\ .ittai king the announcement.
"Ibis corporation is creating human em
bi \os loi the sole purpose of killing them and
lui vesting then i ells." said the group's legisla
tive directoi Douglas |ohnson. "I nless Con

gress acts quickly, this corporation and others
will be opening human embryo farms."
And .1 critic of the company who used to sit
on ACT's ethics board s.iid Advanced Cell's
announcement was premature and would
serve only to encourage such harsh reaction
against cloning.
C.lenn NlcCee, a I niversity ol Pennsylvania
bioethicist who resigned from Advanced Cell
technology's ethics advisory board, called the
announcement "nothing but hype." He said
the company's report lac ks any significant de
tails. including what cells companv scientists at -
tuallygrew from the cloned embryo. Hie paper
doesn't say il Advanced Cell was able to derive
any human embryonic stem cells from its
c loning effort.
" 1 hey are doing science by press release,"
he said.
In findings published yesterda\ In an online
journal entitled e-biomed: The Journal of Re
generative Medicine and the online edition of
Scientific American, the scientists said they had
grown a six-cell human embryo.
I lie scientists described all the work as pre
liminary. Neither experiment has yet produced
the coveted stems c ells, master c ells which grow
