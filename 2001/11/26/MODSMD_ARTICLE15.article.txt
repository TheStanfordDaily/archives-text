## The 						Stanford Daily Bad publicity for Stertzer's clubs is unfortunate 
### 
Published Since IS')I

Medical School Prof. Simon Stertzer's
recently decided to sell the three
strip clubs he had purchased to
fund his research due to negative
publicity. Unfortunately, he has been singled
out for extraordinary and undeserved scrutiny
because of a personal investment that would
only help the University and further cardiovas
cular research.
Stertzer originally purchased three Las
Vegas strip clubs to fund his own angioplasty re
search, with some of the money going to Stan
lord as well. I le invested his own money in these
clubs, because they ollered a high rate of cash
flow that could continuously fund his research.
1 le did not participate in the daily operations of
the clubs in any way.
The negative publicity that the clubs gener
ated. both within Stanford and in the larger

community, forced him to sell them. The fact
that he felt the need to do so is unfortunate for
several reasons.
First, Stertzer invested his own money, not
Stanford's, nor the government's nor a private
foundation's. If he had used the money the
clubs generated to buy himself a yacht, no one
would have complained. Stertzer's personal in
vestments arc his own affair. They should not re
flect on Stanford.
As long as Stanford does not investigate the
private business maneuvers of every professor
and employee to ensure they are seemlvand ap
propriate, discouraging Stertzer seems unlair.
Ironically, because Stertzer decided to use
the money for charitable purposes, he was
suddenly scrutinized and criticized, fie said
that the money would have been used to fur
ther advances in medical technologies and to

add to Stanford's endowment, both laudable
and worthy causes. Stertzer's decision to use
his personal funds for charitable causes is
praiseworthy and should be encouraged in
stead ofdenounced.
Previously, Stertzer had used his personal
business investments to further education,
using profits from a medical device company he
founded to endow a chair in cardiology. The
profits from the strip clubs could have very well
assisted in die creation of similar benefits for the
I Jniversity and for cardiac medicine.
If an individual whose wealth came from a
legal endeavor wished to donate to Stanford's
endowment, that money would usually be ac
cepted with gratitude. 1 his case with Stertzer
should not be different just because lie is a pro
fessor here.
()f course, strip clubs are not very wholesome

businesses, particularly because many people
feel they promote the degradation of women
and negative stereotypes. However, they are
legal institutions in I vis Vegas, and as such,
Stertzer should be free to invest in them.
I'hose who reap the benefits of his research
probably would not care where the money that
funded these technologies came from.
The swirling storm of negative publicity is
unfortunate, as it only distracted Stertzer from
his research, the opposite of what he wanted
the investment to accomplish. Stertzer was
using innovative thinking and perfectly legal
means in the name of higher goals and aca
demic research. For this, he has nothing to be
ashamed of. It is unfortunate that some peo
ple's overreactions forced him to abandon his
plan for funding worthy research and pursuing
educational goals.
