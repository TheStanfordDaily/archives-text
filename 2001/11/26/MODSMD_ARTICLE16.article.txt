.111 ac tiv it\ tli.it is a personal rarity .it
school, .i forbidden I'm it tli.it I am
forced to deny myself while classes
are in session: watching copious amounts
of tele\ ision.
Alter live days laden with television. I
have begun to dichotomi/c all of its content
and characters into two categories: that
which I love and that which I loathe. Be
causc television does its very best to be ex
treme. we are vaguclv obligated to be more
extreme in our reaction to it. Mv television
love list includes: Nelly Kurtado and her
mud video, commercials lor the fragrance
"Kternitv," ('.-SPAN, Beyonce," I alk Soup,"
"M I \ (.ribs." Rudy (".iuliani, "Sex and the
(lit v." übei -aw kward blind dates," Ihe 1 rc>n
(.lie I." Shakira (though I'm upset that my

secret I .at in pop princess
has lound her way from
the C>iilf Stream to the
mainstream), David l.et
tennan, "Malcolm in the
Middle," Lucy Liu, the
new Sears ads, Zack Mor
ris's nascent role on
"NAT!) Blue," U2, the
coverage ol I hanksgiving

college football "civil wars" such as Vander
bilt versus I ennessee, the video lor E.nya s
new song "()nly I ime. ' j.Lo,Jay-Z, Ja Rule
and the eoinmereial fin Polo.com. which is
more endearing than most of the movies
I've seen this year and makes me teary.
Alter the past week's epic sessions in
front of the television, my recently abridged
loathe list includes: Carrot Top. Katherine
"Wonderbra" I larris, I'iger Woods (1 don't
care how rich he is. it is tragic to button the
top button of a polo shirt), NB( '.'s star-span
gled peacock that perma-hovers on the
screen, Nickelback. "Survivor" et al., the ex
cess of post-mortem Aaliyah specialsand the
tacky and menacing "terror" montages that
preface news shows.
Regarding commercials, I am alarmed at
the amount of beer, lood and clothing .ids
th.it consistently depict a Maxim-reading,
misogynous male with a beautiful and dot
ing wife who never seems to tire of his tru
ant familial attitude. As lar as I know, in real
life, those macho men swim in their alx>ve
ground pools sans a blond, charming mate.
And as for car commercials, they define
their own new, strange genie. Luxury and
low-end automobiles alike lx>w to the code
of melodrama, as every ad is shot in apoca
lyptic lines and surreal shutter speeds.
I'd also like to draw attention to the chan
nel 1.! fora moment. As a c hannel that touts
itself as the pundit and the hawk of contem
porary television. K! is brimming with innu
endo. Though I ! attempts to transcend the
latent erotic ism of modern programming
and take the high road of cable media, its
parsimonious use of clothing on Brooke
Burke (ex-Baywatch queen and c urrent star
of the travel-show-cum-orgy "Wild On")
smacks of the carnal low road. It's good
stuff: I was enraptured as Brooke whimsi

c .iIK Hit ted around like .i sea uvmph during
"Wild On Ihi/a." and her ever-changing
sarongs enchanted me. Incidentally. K! re
cently promoted the ex-host ol the show,
the luminously .tcute and eloquent |ules
Asner. to her own show, during which she
will interview c elebrities with invariably inci
sive c|i lest ions.
I lie events of Sept. I I are evident on the
faceol television tocla\ While civil lilkm tari
ans preach that we cannot let terrorism
compromise unparalleled American free
doms, lor better or lor worse, the ethos ol
prime time has been overhauled and the
terrorists have triumphed on this Iront.
Networks have censored or canceled vio
lence and embraced the sentimental and,
more conspicuously, the sew. American
television now resembles European televi
sion because ta-tas are m< >re abundant and
superfluous than ever belore. At the risk of
sounding generic , I won't harp on this, but
anv legitimate analysis oft he conteinporarv
tube must briefly note that, more than ever
before, television is steeped in preserving its
appeal to America v is a vis the lowest com
mon denominator.
Examples rife with shameless connota
tion include the lad that guests on Jerry
Springer are no longer allowed to brawl.
I hey are instead encouraged to redirect
their belligerence In remov ing all of their
clothing. Springer, always a cultural van
guard, has completely esc hewed his show 's
violent tangos lor sexual ones. Next, the
logo lor the Microsoft's new X-Box is lav -
ered with both textual and visual erotic
meaning: the green 'X' resembles a yawn
ing vagina that is cooing alluringly, and cer
tainly the term 'lx»x' also echoes (iates's de
liberate attempts at phallac y. Even Georgia
()' Keefe was more subtle with her imagery
than demographic-whore Microsoft.
I here are times when television does its
very best to be self-deprecating and sarcas
tic, but its attempts at detached self-derision
are frequently misdirected or invisible to the
common viewer. Parodies of I'V on TV are
parodies themselves, both hypocritical and
farcical. Fora satiating close of popular cul
ture, I think 1 will keep to Bret Easton Ellis,
who is both ironic and iconic, whereas tele
vision has only attained the latter.
Lastly, the death of the reality show and
the birth of the canonized government
glamorizing programming underscore the
llcdgling public infatuation lor our federal
clockwork. " Hie West Wing, 1 lie Agen
cy" (or lot that matter, "24" and "Alias"), as
well as "Liw and Order," do a tidy job of
covering the branches of the American gov
ernment, and each show has been em
braced by the American viewing populace.
If nothing else, this points to the decline of
our reverence Ibr Richard Hatch and the
rise of an enamoration with Orrin Match
and the rest of Washington.
