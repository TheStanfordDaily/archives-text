Hebron will soon be in the news
()nce again 1 lebron is in the news, this
time under the Reuters headline: Israel
Plans Settlement Homes. Currently some
ol the settlers in I lebron are living in trail
ers on top of a hill called I el Rumeida.
I he government is planning to replace
these with more permanent structures
that can better withstand the continuous
gunlire. But can the settlements in He
bron ever be permanent?
I spent the month of August in the West
Bank, primarily I lebron. investigating the
Intifada for Phe Sun Magazine. What the
Reuters article chose not to report is that
there are only 400 settlers actually living in
I lebron. I he settlers live in the- center of
town: downtown, so to speak. I hey are
surrounded by 120,000 Palestinians who
do not want them there.
This is not a typo; this is a fact. 1 here
are 400 Jews living in the center of a
West Bank town surrounded bv 120.000
Palestinians who do not want them
there. It should also be noted that of
those 400 |ews, no more than 100 of
them are adults.
I he 400 settlers are protected by 2,000
soldiers. This is expensive, and it doesn't
always work. Hebron is the flashpoint.
People that follow Israeli politics should
notice that more often than not, when
there's trouble in Israel, it's 1 lebron that is
being talked about.
The hatreds run so deep that the mili
tary has been dec laring a 24-hour cut few
during which no Palestinian within acer

tain radius of the settlements is allowed
outside. 1 he effect of this order is to place
40,000 Palestinians under house arrest,
and for what?
I here is no oil in Hebron. I here are no
diamond mines. There's good shawerma
and the tomb of Abraham, a site sacred to
the Muslims and the Jews. The settlers in
Hebron are religious. Most would call
them fanatics. But the Israeli government
allows the madness to go on. And every
day we read in the news that someone has
been shot again in 1 lebron.
1 he reason is simple: politics. There
are 200,000 settlers in the West Bank,
and they all vote. I he settlers believe that
when one settlement is dismantled they
could be the next. 1 he right wing in Is
rael has become so powerful that Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, one of the archi
tects of settlements during the 1980s, is
now most threatened by leadership from
the right.
Perhaps if America was not funding Is
rael's living standard to the tune of $3 bil
lion per year, Israel would think twice be
fore building houses in Hebron. Perhaps
it would weigh the cost of the war a little
more closely. After all, 2,000 soldiers to
protect 400 settlers is bad economics by
any measure.
()ne thing is certain, there will be much
shooting in the coining days in Hebron.
Watch lot it on the front page of your local
newspaper.
