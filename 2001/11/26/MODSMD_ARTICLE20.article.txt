M\YV YORK (AIM — Lured by big discounts
and fears thai must-have holiday items will be in
short supply, consumers crowded malls and
shopping i entei s over the Thanksgiving week
end, snapping up video games, I )Vl)s and any
thing to do with I larrv Potter.
However, the weekend's receipts won't be
the bonanza some mere bants hoped for.
1 .11 K-bird specials and other bargains from
big < h.iius like Wal-Mart attracted consumers
who were alreadv frugal before tlie Sept. 1 1 ter
i < >i ist attacks prompted them to further curtail
theii spending. The come-ons worked, giving
the value-priced retailers satisfactory sales.
But other merchants, particularly depart
ment stores and specialty stores that have been
languishing for months, barely met their mod
est expectations loi the weekend, the start of
the holiday bu\ing rush.
"Retailers pushed real hard. Trallic was
strong, but sales were less strong." said Jeffrey
Feiner, managing direclor of Lehman Brothers
lii<., who estimated sales at the 22 retailers he

follows were at best uiu hanged from last year's
Thanksgiving weekend.
In fact, Feiner said his holiday forecast of a
two percent gain in sales of stores open at least
a year might be too optimistic.
"Most stores entered the shopping period
with low expectations, and many met those ex
pectations this weekend," said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
"But deep down they were hoping to get bet
ter than what they got. I here was a lot of win
dow shopping."
Barnard and others said sales were solid Fri
day, but cited a sharper-tban-expec ted drop
off in sales on Saturday and vesterday.
Meanwhile, l ele( bee k Services, a i heck ap
proval service, reported sales paid for In c heck
at stores open at least a year rose 2.4 pert cut on
Friday from last year. Checks account for about
a third of retail spending and remain second to
cash as the most popular method of pavment.
The increase was iu line with its forecast for.i
two percent gain.

I In* I hanksgiving weekend isn't necessarily
<i good indicator ol how retailers will perforin
for the entire season. In the past lew years, the
weekend accounted for less than 10 percent ol
sales, .k cording to the International C '.ouncil ol
Shopping ('enters.
More importantly, the weekend alter
thanksgiving is seen as a barometer of con
sinners' willingness to spend.
I o spur sales, retailers are giying bigger and
eai lier (list ounts than last year, letting shoppers
haggle over prices and coming up with some
unconventional enticements. For example,
Sears on Saturday olfered 10 penent oil on all
items, even those already discounted, from 7
a.m to noon.
"I kind ol (eel like we're better oil this year
bet ause the sales are better." said Stat \ kosub,
a 27-vcar-old attorney from Wichita Falls.
Texas, who shopped at the Vista Ridge Mall in
the Dallas suburb ol Fewisville. "Fveryone has
knocked even thing so low because of the antic
ipated drop-oil. I've actually spent more."
