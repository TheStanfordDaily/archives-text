# Irish put up a fight against the Cardinal
## 
### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
On a rainy, windy and drear) niglu
at Stanford Stadium Saturday, it looked
like No. 13 Stanford's dreams fora 10-
win season — in addition to the nation
al respect that it has slowly earned
throughout a surprising season —
could be washed away l>\ a torrent of
sloppiness and gusts of offensive inepti
tude against Notre Dame.

FOOTBALL
Sunday: No. 14 Stanford 17,
Notre Dame 14

But then, trailing 13-10 with 1:08
remaining in the game, redshirt fresh
man running hack Kenneth I'olon
dashed into the end/one to keep Stan
ford in the national consciousness and
continue building momentum for next
season. His decisive one-yard sweep
gave the Cardinal a 17-13 victory that
also knocked the lighting Irish from
howl eligibility and might have finally
cost Notre Dame head coach Bob
Davie his job.
"I just felt like this team never gave
up," said I'olon, who carried the ball
18 times fora career-high 133 yards in
the place of injured running backs
Kerry Carter and Brian Allen. "That is
definitely one of the characteristics of
our team."
For the second consecutive week, the
Cardinal struggled against an opponent
that pundits believed Stanford would
steamroll with the nation's fifth-ranked
scoring offense.
The Cardinal trailed 13-3 through
out most of the frustrating night, even
though Notre Dame completed just one
pass. Yes, just one pass — a first-quarter
slant to Omar Jenkins taken 47 yards for
a touchdown, exploiting an ill-timed

blitz by senior safety Tank Williams —
gave Notre Dame an early 7-3 lead.
"()bviously, you are not going to win
when your quarterback completes one
pass," Davie said.
I he scary thing is, the Irish almost
did win.
At one point in the third quarter,
Stanford had more punts (six) than
points (three) and had to rely on its se
nior-laden defense to bail the team out
once again.
"Our defense did a great job," Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willingham
said. "Without them, we would not have
been in a position to win the game."
Yet, the Cardinal was just as awful on
offense as the Irish for three-and-a-half
quarters.
After marching down the field on its

first drive, which ended in a field goal by
senior Mike Biselli, Stanford's offense
stalled fora multitude of reasons.
"It took us so long for us to get a feel
for their defense," senior offensive line
man Eric Heitmann said. "We were in
consistent for the first three quarters"
"We had to get some energy going,
we just did not have that zeal," Willing
ham said.
Senior quarterback Randy Fasani —
starting for the first time in five weeks
after suffering a torn medial collateral
ligament against Oregon — was visibly
rusty.
I le completed just 8-of-23 passes for
159 yards, often misfiring badly on pass
es to wide receivers.

Shaking off the rust from sitting out with a knee injury, senior quarterback Randy Fasani
led the team to a sloppy 17-14 victory over Notre Dame.
