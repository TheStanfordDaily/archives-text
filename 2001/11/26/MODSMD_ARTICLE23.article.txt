Playing its biggest game of the
season without Pacific 10 confer
ence MVP and team scoring
leader junior Roger Levesque, the
No. men's soccer team needed a
new hero.
And they found one.
Freshman Matt Janus/ scored
three goals for the first hat trick of
his career in the Cardinal's :i-l
vic tory over Santa Clara (12-9-0,
5-1-0 West Coast Conference) in
the second round of the NCAA
tournament.
"It was great to see a freshman

Dunivant. "He needed to step lip
in Roger's absence and he did. It
was great for him and the team."

team's final regular season game
against Oregon State — a game
that sealed the conference champi

low freshman Darren Fernandez
at Stanford's front line.
"It was a new dynamic not to
have Roger starting," saitl senior
Derek Shannahan. "But I'm fully
confident in both Darren and Matt
and the) did a great job playing to
gether. It was unfortunate not to
have Roger, but you have to focus
on what you tit) have and draw
confidence from the guys that will
be playing."
Santa Clara earned the chance
to face the new Stanford front line
after its 1-0 triple-overtime victory
over California on Friday.
"We didn't underestimate
[Santa Clara]. The score was 1-0
the first time we played and they
are a local rival," Dunivant said.
" I'hey are never easy to play, es
pecially in a playoff game. We
lost to them two years ago in the
tournament, which helped make
us even more focused this time
around."
Nerves were heightened by a
fit-It 1 that was made sloppy and
slow In the weekend's rain.
"We obviously would like the
field to be dry and flat so that we
could play our stvle of game rather
than having to keep the ball in the
air," Shannahan said. "The field
was playable and the grounds crew
tlitl ;i great job, so we just had to not
think about it and ignore the occa
sional slipping."
Janus/, calmed the team down
less than five minutes into the
game with a goal into the bottom
right corner of the net.
Adding an insurance goal later
in the half, Janus/ found the ball at
his feet — after a shot by senior
Matt Moses was deflected off of a
Santa Clara defender — and easi
ly beat the Broncos goalie for his
second goal of the game.
Just as the half was coming to a
close, Santa Clara clawed back to
within one when senior Anthony
Chimienti found the back of the
net with a hard fired shot to the
corner of the net that was able to
beat Cardinal junior goalie An

Playing its biggest game of the
season without Pacific 10 confer
ence MVP and team scoring
leader junior Roger Levesque, the
No. men's soccer team needed a
new hero.
And they found one.
Freshman Matt Janus/ scored
three goals for the first hat trick of
his career in the Cardinal's :i-l

5-1-0 West Coast Conference) in
the second round of the NCAA
tournament.
"It was great to see a freshman

play so well," said junior lodd
Dunivant. "He needed to step lip
in Roger's absence and he did. It
was great for him and the team."
After getting a red card in the
team's final regular season game
against Oregon State — a game
that sealed the conference champi
onship tor Stanford (17-1-1, 7-1-1
Pacific 10 conference) — l.evesque
was fort eel to watch the team's first
playoff game from the sideline.

low freshman Darren Fernandez
at Stanford's front line.
"It was a new dynamic not to
have Roger starting," saitl senior
Derek Shannahan. "But I'm fully
confident in both Darren and Matt
and the) did a great job playing to
gether. It was unfortunate not to
have Roger, but you have to focus
on what you tit) have and draw
confidence from the guys that will
be playing."
Santa Clara earned the chance
to face the new Stanford front line
after its 1-0 triple-overtime victory
over California on Friday.
"We didn't underestimate
[Santa Clara]. The score was 1-0
the first time we played and they
are a local rival," Dunivant said.
" I'hey are never easy to play, es
pecially in a playoff game. We
lost to them two years ago in the
tournament, which helped make
us even more focused this time
around."
Nerves were heightened by a
fit-It 1 that was made sloppy and
slow In the weekend's rain.
"We obviously would like the
field to be dry and flat so that we
could play our stvle of game rather
than having to keep the ball in the
air," Shannahan said. "The field
was playable and the grounds crew
tlitl ;i great job, so we just had to not
think about it and ignore the occa
sional slipping."
Janus/, calmed the team down
less than five minutes into the
game with a goal into the bottom
right corner of the net.
Adding an insurance goal later
in the half, Janus/ found the ball at
his feet — after a shot by senior
Matt Moses was deflected off of a
Santa Clara defender — and easi
ly beat the Broncos goalie for his
second goal of the game.
Just as the half was coming to a
close, Santa Clara clawed back to
within one when senior Anthony
Chimienti found the back of the
net with a hard fired shot to the
corner of the net that was able to
beat Cardinal junior goalie An

Janusz was not yet done, as he
