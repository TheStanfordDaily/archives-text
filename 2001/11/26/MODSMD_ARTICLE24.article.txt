After Stanford's first three games, it
seems as though Curtis Borchardt lias
springs in his shoes rather than screws in
his foot.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 14 Stanford 78,
Purdue 62

Maybe lie's just making lip for iosi time.
For the third-straight game, Borchardt,
who had foot surgery in March, recorded .1
double-double and dominated the front
court to help lead No. 14 Stanford (H-O) to
a 78-62 victory over Purdue at the )olm
Wooden Tradition.
"It's been a long time [since] I've been
able to go out there and compete like that,"
said Borchardt, who has missed the end of
the last two seasons with an ailing right foot.
"I really felt good out there. I'm starting to
jump a little better."
Imagine what he'll be able tc> do when he
can jump "a lot" better.
Borchardt, a junior center, recorded 1H
points and a career-high 20 rebounds. I Ic
also tied his own school record of six blocks
in one game.
"By the end of the game, {Purdue]
didn't want much of Curtis." said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "I le w;is so valu
able inside. I le competed tonight. I le kept
the ball alive."
One reason Borchardt was so successful
underneath the basket was because Boiler
maker center John Allison and forward
Rodney Smith were forced out of much of
the game due to foul trouble.
Allison, who is 6-foot-10, picked up his
fourth foul with 7:20 to go in the second
half and Smith recorded bis fourth with
6:20 left.

One double-double for Stanford wasn't
enough, as junior (-asey Jacobsen recorded
his first of the year, tallying a game-high 26
points and grabbing a career-high 12 re
bounds. 1 le scored eight of Stanford's final
1 I points, as the Cardinal finished the game
on a 15-5 run.
Lost in the end-of-game statistics was
freshman Josh Childress, who scored 21
points. Childress certainly wasn't lost,
however, among the partisan crowd,
which certainly noticed the slender for
ward slashing in and out of defenders,
moving with and without the ball with
ease and capping Stanford drives with
two-hand slams and easy layups. One eve
opening spin move preceded a final layup
that gave the Cardinal a 57-50 lead with
8:10 to go.
"Everybody contributed," Jacobsen
said. "The more games we play the more
people will have to pay attention to Curtis
and Josh."
Stanford outrebounded Purdue 57-37,
and with such a dominating inside game,
it didn't matter that the Cardinal was 0-
for-f) from 3-point land. Until Saturday,
Stanford had not played a game in the last
three years without converting at least one
3-pointer.
Although Stanford seemed in control
for the ma jority of the game, Purdue kept
ihe game close and rode an 11 -2 run in the
second half to pull to within two points at
50-52.
Ihe Boilermakers took advantage of
sophomore forward Justin Davis' absence
for much of the game because of foul trou
ble. After committing three fouls early in
the first half , Davis was forced to the bench
<ind then sat out most of the second half
after recording his fourth foul with 14:35
remaining.
Stanford next faces Texas at the Classic 4
Kids in Chicago on Saturday.
