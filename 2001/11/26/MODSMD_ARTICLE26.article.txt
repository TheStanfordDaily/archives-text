SatiirchiN evening I'vrone Willingham put his
team's laif in tlie hands of his seniors, and while tliev
hardU painted a masterpiece in No. lit Stanford's 17-
vi< tor\ over Notre Dame (4-(>), their muddy doo
dling was enough to give the (Cardinal its eighth win
of the season.
I lie fortunate few Stanford faithful that fortified
cold, rainv Stanford Stadium until the end of the hat
tie bore witness to Stanford's (8-2, f>-2 Pacific 10 (011-

importanth .1 10-point fourth quarter lighting Irish
lead. I he seniors took their final how on the Farm,
and through utter determination ilicv kept their foot

Fasani never realh found his rhvthm, yet he had

touchdown drives.
First, in a pla\ that resembled a c ruti.il final quar

Fven without the team's leading
rusher, senior Brian Allen, for
most of the game, Stanford
