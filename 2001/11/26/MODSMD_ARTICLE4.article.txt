### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he Queer Straight Social
and Political Alliance is hoping to
reach out lo students that often
have 110 other place to go —
straight allies oft lie queer commu
nity. Starting <it 1 I:()() a.m. in
White IMa/a tomorrow, OSSI'A
will hold it's lirst ever "I Support
Straight Allies" campaign.
Alliance members w ill hand out
stickers saying "Straight Allies
Rock!" and are promoting a party
tomorrow evening in in 1 residder.
1 lie party, running from 9:00
p.m. to I 1:()() p.m., will have music
and food, as well as opportunities
for people to discuss why they are
a straight ally or what a straight
ally has done lot them.
" loo often the straight portion
of queer / straight alliances is seen
as a joke, nothing more than lip
service," said junior Jesse Evans,
one of the co-founders of the al
liance. "Because of a general lac k
of outreach to straight allies, many
of them don't feel welcome in or
ganizations like ours simply be
cause no one has explicitly told
them how valuable they are."
I lie alliance hopes to make it
more obvious to the Stanford com
munity that straight allies are vital
to its movement. I his is the first
year tor this event and Kvans hopes
50 people will attend the" party.
"We just want straight allies to
feel good about what they do for
us." Kvans said. "It can be difficult
to be an open ally, sometimes less
justifiable in people's minds than
being openly queer."
Alliance members also want the
event to be a celebration for the
work that straight allies do every
day. Straight allies are an integral
part of their organization and
go;ils. Kvans said.
Sophomore Julie Fitzgerald
said she joined last year w hen the
alliance was first formed because
queer issues were very important
to her friends and therefore were
important to her.
"I think most people would

agree that discrimination of any
form is unacceptable," Fitzgerald
said. "Discrimination against
queer people is especially preva
lent today."
Fitzgerald said slu- believes that
the more straight allies band to
gether, the less welcome any dis
criminators against the gay com
munity will feel.
"I think a lot of straight allies
are scared to join groups like
QSSI'A because they don't want
people to think that they're
queer," Fitzgerald said. "What it's
really about is supporting fellow
students and friends and fighting
the stigmas that make it uncom
fortable for anyone to be who they
really are."
Kvans said he feels that this year
the gay commifnity is being treat
ed very well, but that another im
portant issue is how the straight al
lies are being treated and what
kind of support straight allies have
access to.
"I feel like queer allies are gen
erally supported on campus,"
Fitzgerald said. "I think it's more
accepted to be a queer ally here
than it is to be homophobic."
I lie alliance hosts bi-weekly
social events, monthly parties and
opportunities to engage in politi
cal activism to create pride and
solidarity among the queer and
queer-allied communities. No
one in the alliance is asked what
their orientation is, thereby en
suring that there is no pressure to
self-identify.
"We are committed to involv
ing straight allies as much as queer
students," Kvans said.
