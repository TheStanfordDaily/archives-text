## UC system's new "Comprehensive Review" process will give more weight to extracurricular activities 
### SHANNA MCCORD 
In a controversial revamp ol its admissions policy,
the I niversit\ ol (lalifornia has decided to give weight
to ac tivities, t ire umstances and accomplishments out
side the traditional academic arena when evaluating
applications this vear.
While the new method is aimed at diversifying the
student bod\ at the eight UC campuses, critics have la
beled the move a hat kdooi revival of affirmative action,
which tlu 1 I ( Board ol Regents and Prop. 2(H) elimi
nated in 1990.
I he regents recent!)' voted 15-4 in favor of adopting
the new polic \. known as "comprehensive review," for
use in Us admissions decisions, meaning that it will take
more than a high grade point average or perfect SA 1
score l< n a student to be considered an ideal candidate.
Now. admissions officials will look for demonstrat
ed success outside the classroom in areas like art,
imisit, sports oi leadership roles in their applicants, as
well as pei sonal stories ofovercoming adversity or eco
nomic hardships.
" I his eliminates the two-tier system," saitl Brian
llavwartl, directoi of communications for the UC
Board of Regents.

l nder the former two-tiei guidelines, ihe Universi
ty of (California was required first to admit 50 to 75 per
cent of its freshman class based solel\ on academic
standing and test scores.
l'he remaining eligible candidates were then chosen
in regards to supplemental ci iteria siu li .is extracurric
ular activities and leadership.
(College admissions experts, ini hiding some .it Stan
ford, have faulted the U(C system's two-tier svstem for
de-emphasizing broader personal achievements in
favor of numerical figures such as CiPAs and SAT
scores, especially at U(C-Berkele\ and I ( LA, its two
most competitive campuses.
(Considered (California's "public Ivies," the two
schools' current policies have been thought to make it
difficult for students with non-academu assets to get
in. Now, both will assign a "personal achievement"
rank, based upon non-academic factors, to every stu
dent that applies.

talking about the caliber of students who apply to these
top schools, they're all super qualified, but w here's the
creativity and passion?"
