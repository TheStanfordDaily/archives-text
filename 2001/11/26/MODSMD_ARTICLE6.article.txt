# IHUM replaces frosh book with film series
## 
### KOK-TONG KHOO 
As late as last week, some freshmen re
ported not knowing w hat this yeai 's fresh
man Ijook is — and with good reason.
I his year's freshman "book' is not actual
ly a book at all, but a set of four films In
Krrol Morris, who will speak to the fresh
man class on feb. (i as part of the fresh
man Book program.
Four of his films — "The I Inn Blue
I.ine," "A Brief Histon of lime," "Fast,
Cheap .ind Out of Control" and "Mr.
Death —have been selected as this
year's "texts."
Within the film industry. Morris has re
ceived prestigious awards. "Fast, Cheap
and ()ut of (lontrol" (1997) won him the
Best Documentary Film Award from the
National Board of Review. He also has
won a Guggenheim Fellow ship.
I ppeiclassmen who took part iu the
program during their fii st year at Stanford
report being surprised l>\ the change. And
some freshmen are not even aware of the
change vet: this year's works are being an

nounced dm ing Introduction to the I lu
manities lectures this week.
I he program was launched three years
ago to create a shared intellectual experi
ence for freshmen.
List year, Maxine Hong Kingston's
" I lie Woman Warrior" was the freshman
book. In previous years, loin Stoppard's
"Arcadia" and (iharles Johnson's "Middle
Passage" were the featured texts.
I "his year is the first year that the
freshman book w ill be in an alternative
medium.
Bui Rob Robinson, director of IHUM,
said the program had never intended for
the freshman book to always be a book in
the traditional sense.
"It was.i principle decision, for one year
at least, to try a different kind of humanis
tic text," he said. "We had been talking for
a while in HUM that the freshman book,
as it's come to be known, shouldn't always
lx' a l)ook."
In the future, the program mayconsid-

Some students speculated tli.it

betause a filminakei would be less

but Robinson said bringing Morris

"All of these people have cost us
more or less the same amount."' he
said. "In priiuiple, I would think 11
was hartlet to gel a filmmaker than
