"Cool! They're offering sex
toys now!"
1 his was ilit- response <>1 one
sophomore after learning that the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen
ter gives out 112 ree flavored, heating
massage oil samples.
Ironically, the SHI'RC began
offering the massage oils last year
as an alluring alternative to sex, in
hopes of encouraging sensual ac
tivities as a substitute for doing
the deed.
"We want to provide students
with ways to be sensual and inti
mate without having intercourse,"
said senior Sam Richardson, co-di
rector of the center.
I he center first offered mas
sage oils to students last spring
quarter. Phis quarter, massage oils
did not become available until
Nov. 6. Since then, the center has
given away 28 massage oil sam
ples, sold four samples and eight
larger bottles of massage oil.
When blown on, the massage oils
make a person's skin feel hot, pro
viding sensual pleasure. The oils are
also scented with the listed flavor.
Because the massage oils —
which appear in flavors like pas

sion fruit and guava-pineap
ple — are not generally consid
ered essential, practical health
items, the free distribution of this
resource has stirred some contro
versy on campus.
"Wouldn't our money be better
spent on useful health items, like
cold medicine?" asked sophomore
Geoff Morris.
Junior Katharine Willoughby,
co-director ol the SHPRC, re
sponded to such claims by point
ing out tli.it the massage samples,
which come extremely cheap, ac
count fora tiny portion of the cen
ter's budget.
"Our main goal is to provide
people with education and an in
formation resource, not free stuff,"
she added.
Ihe center began providing
massage supplies to students be
cause it wanted to reach out to
people who are not necessarily
having intercourse.
"We are trying to get rid of the
image that we are an organization
providing services only for those
students who are having sex,"
Willoughby said. "We've gotten
