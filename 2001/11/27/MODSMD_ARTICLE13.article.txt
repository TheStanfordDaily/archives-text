### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At a spec ial Sunda\ meeting, six \SSI un
dergraduate senators listened to juniors Mon
ica I lenestro/a and l .olila Koihal ol the Stan
lord Laboi Action (Committee discuss the I ni
vi'i'sit\ s decision to subcontract 10 janitorial
jobs at the Medical ( eniei.
I lie meeting n.is meant to inform the
Senate on the issue before the hod\ voted
I uesda\ upon a resolution to support the
committee s a( lions ,md condemn I niversi
t\ sulx ontrac ting.

I lenesiroza and Koihal s.iid that when jobs
are subcontracted, workers generalh receive
lowei wages — otien below the povertv
level — and lose- benefits and rights to collec -
live bargaining.
However, Lou Sakscn, vice president for
gener.il services at the Medical (lei iter, said in
an interview with 1 lie Dailv eailiei this month
that the gap between subcontracted and regu
lar emplovee benefits had narrowed over the
last 1 0 \ c'.u s.
Officials s.i\ the 10 emplovees would be
moved to othei positions instead ol being
laid oil.
I lenesiroza. however, s.iid she suspected
thai subcontracted workers would eveniuallv
replace the othei IT)0 hospital maintenance
stall positions.
" fen jobs ... is that w here il stops?" I Idle
st i (>za asked. " \o

flenestroza said the subcontracting deci
sion was prompted bv the Medical ( enter's
losses during the dissolved I ( SF-Stanibrcl
I lealth ( are merger and the practice of health
maintenance organizations requiring the I ni
versitv to pav loi expensive, long-term proce
dures inherent in a leac lung hospital.
"Basic allv. the hospital has gone broke, she
said. "'We need to cut somewhere.' 1 hat's
what lliev re going to s.i\
ASSI Vice President (ihristine ( ordero, a
junior, laughed and s.iid such a move would
save "peanuts."
I lenesiroza agreed and doubted that siib
c ontrac ting 10 jobs would t over what she said
was the Medical Center's SlO million debt.
She noted thai subcontracting often increases
costs, as economic emnlovers must |>av for the
cost of training and increasing se
curity fora new workforce with
high turnover rates.
It would be cheaper, she said,
to hire regular employees.
Roibal charged that a subcon
tractor would not provide ade

quate services to hospital con
sumers. " I licit main goal is prof
it, whether or not they have the
best care." she said.
In a letter to Henestro/a, Se
nior Assistant to the President Jeff
Wac htel said c|u.ilitv of care would
remain consistent.
"Saksen . . . made it clear that
the same high standards set for
out housekeeping employees are
applied to contractors." Wae htel

wrote. "Mr. Saksen indicated that
the Hospital has successfully used
contractors in the past."
Wat litel said the I niversity was
dedicated to teaching, learning
.iihl research to benefit humanity,
and doing so with a sense of social
responsibility.
Ilenestroza and Roibal previ
ously met with Wachtel to inform
I niversity President John Hen
ness\ about the issue, but Roibal

called that meeting inadequate.
" I hey told us that they didn't
know much about the
issue . . . but that they weren't
going to do anything about it,"
Roibal said.
The action committee and
representatives of other activist
groups on campus will meet
with Saksen to discuss the issue
today. Their hope is that Saksen
w ill put off the decision, set for

Friday, of what subcontracting
company to use until lie can bet
ter review student and worker
concerns.
"()nce they decide what compa
ny, it's kind of Over," Roibal said.
She noted that some companies
do allow workers to collectively
bargain and expressed hope that
the University would pick one ol
those if it subcontracted. '
Henestro/a and Roibal urged

the Senate to support tln* resolu
tion because the bod\ represents
students who receive hospital ser
vices, although Saksen has
stressed that in-patient care areas
will not be subcontracted.
I lenestroza said she felt passing
the resolution would be a strong
Senate action and claimed that the
administration has historically lis
tened more to the ASSU than in
dividual student groups.
