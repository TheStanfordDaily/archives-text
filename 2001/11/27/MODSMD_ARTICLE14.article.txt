## The

The I niversitv <>l California has de
rided to give weight to activities,
no n-academic accomplishments
and personal triumphs over adver
sity when evaluating all applications, start
ing this year.
I his policy, known .is comprehensive re
view, will replace the two-tiered system ol
I C admission. I (. used to admit f>() to 75
percent ol students based solclv on aca
demic standing and lest scores, then admit
the rest ol students based on numbers and
personal lac tors.
Modilving the admissions polic\ is a
good decision — now, all candidates w ill be
evaluated on the same criteria and nuinci i
cal figures will (ease to be a final word on
admission.
I lowever. the polic v's ambiguous c i itei la
leaves the potential for majoi problems.

ruining from a completely objective stan
dard of test scores to .» much more subjec -
tive standard ol personal stories allows a lot
of contusion for students and officials,
adding to an alrcadv subjective process of
admissions.
In addition, the new policy could en
courage students to write competing sob
stories of hardships, which are ditfic ult to
vei il\ and clo not nccessai i1 \ indic ate a pel
son's ability.
lorinei provost (londoleezza Rice told
prospective Stanford freshmen in a I ( .M>B
speech that admission to Stanford was not a
reward. Inn rather a bet on the sort of peo
ple they would become, a sound principle
foi admissions m general, hi general, com
prehensive review does appear to be a bel

son students will become, as an individual

who has accomplished many c\ti aorclinai v
things !>\ the age of 18 shows great future
potential. However, comprehensive admis
sions should not come at the expense of
a< adcmic standai(ls.
Academic achievement is the main pur
pose of university siudv I ( promises to
keep academics the "highest priority" in
the admissions process, but does not detail
exactly how academics will be weighed
against these new considerations. Nor did
I ( olfic ials explain how they w ill be ac
countable loi comparing like candidates.
While I ( s desire to downplay the un
pen tame of standardized tests is under
standable. objective standards should not
be completely put l>\ aside. College admis

records from different high schools. .V
long as the SAT is not used as a primary lac
tor in determining admission, but merely
used to provide additional context to an ap
plication (as is the case currently at Stan
ford), its use is justifiable in distinguishing
otherwise similar candidates.
More important than standardized tests
achievements in areas beyond the class
room indicate a person's motivations anc
aptitude for creativity and hard work. Ad
missions officers can and do use this per
sonal information to get a sense ol how ai
individual would contribute to campus life
both in the classroom and as part of a com
inunitv of students.
While the policy's ambiguity leaves tlu
potential for more uncertainty, it is toe
early to say whether its effect on the I C. sy s
tcm w ill be beneficial or deleterious.
