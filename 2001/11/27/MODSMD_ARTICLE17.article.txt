We must make an exception for such

Stanford should increase solar
power usage
Ret enth. there has been a lot of discus
sion around the issue ol sustainabilit\ at
Stanford. It is reassuring to see that the
administration beginning to take envi
ronmental concerns seriouslv, but much
more 1.111 be done. (lalifbi nia is 1111 Tenth
.11 the leading edge ol the transit it in from
lossil-fuels it) renewable energv sources.
()n a state level, the (lalifornia Powei Au
t hoi it \ and the Public I 111 it its Commis
sion are aggressively promoting solar
photovoltaic power with tax incentives
and buy-down programs.
I lie City of San Francisco recentl\
passed two of the most far-reaching energy
measures in the nation, paving the wa\ for
the world's largest urban solar power I.it ili
t\ to be built 011 rooftops throughout the
tin. And in Los Angeles, the Community
( '.ollegc Distrk t is considering .1 proposal tt)
outfit 1.2 billion dollars worth of new con
st met ion with solar power.
Stanford I niversity, which prides itself
as ,111 academic and cultural leader iu (lal
ifornia. not tt) mention in the nation, can
join the growing list of institutions of
higher learning which are bringing eco
logical principles out of their classrooms
and into their short- and long-term build
ing plans. Schools like CU-Bouldcr, the
I niversity of Pennsylvania and Connecti
cut College are all taking steps it) actively
curtail their greenhouse gas emissions
through combinations of efficiency and
purchases of renewable energy.
As the I 'niversity's Fnvironmental Stew
ardship Management Croup releases its re

poll 111 I Ik* coming weeks. I strongly urge
the Administration and the Board ol
I nistees to make a substantial and measur
able commitment to renewable energv.
Specifically, b\ 2001V all new buildings
should receive 2."> percent of their energv
from photovollait solar generation. In addi
tion, all retrofitted buildings should include
energv efficient \ and conservation mea
sures to reduce energv consumption bv 25
percent. Ovei time, the I niversit) should
rati bet up the penentage of renewable en
ergv in the mix. so that bv 2010, 2f> percent
of the energv consumed In Stanford should
be solar electric, and that b\ 2020. ">0 per
cent should be solar elet trii
I here are cou lit less stx ial, envin >nnien
tal and arademit reasons for Stanford to
step up and become a leader in clean ener
gv. Ihe onlv question has to do with eco
nomics— but the price of solai power is
falling by the month \\ ith emerging slate
based incentive programs, the tost of solar
can be made competitive in the short term,
while sav ing nionev in the long term.
Alameda countv put solai panels on the
roof Of the Santa Rita |ail without spending
a pennv from their general fund simplv bv
using the state subsidies available to them.
I lie time has tome for Stanford to take
action on renewable energy. Students, fac
ulty. staff, and other Stanford community
members are t ailing on the administration
to commit to solar power for new buildings.
Kveiyone is invited to a solar party this
Thursday with free ftxxl, drink, speakers
and a band, all brought to you by the solar
jxrner of Greenpeace s demonstration vehi
cle. the Rolling Sunlight. The event Ix-gins
at 5:!H) p.m. at Columbae I louse.
