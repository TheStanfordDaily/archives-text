# Soccer got its kicks in a fun year
## 
### 
Women's soccer season was
a roller-coaster ride all
the way to the Sweet 16
II vou were lo follow Stanford
women's soccer like I have lot the
past lew months, you would no
doubt have fallen in love with this
team.
Now I know some of us Americans

have .1 filing against sup
porting so«cr, l)iii bear
with me because 11 lis c 01-1111111
1111111 is important.
Most of us don't ap
pnt iatc soccer .it all. I
mean, it's not football in
our eyes — like it is iu
the rest of the world s —
and despite a recent

resurgence in the American public s ac
ceptance ol this sport, soccer plavers still
have a long wa\ to go before they become
so< ietal pop figures.
But I think it's important fbi Stanford
students and lacult\ to know how amaz
ing this young ('.ardinal team is and how
provocative its 2001 season was.
In other words, now that it's over, it's
time to reflect.
Personally, I've always thought it quite
strange that spectators can be so emo
tionally connec ted with sporting teams.
However, I too fell vic tim to this psy
chological phenomena this season as I
tagged along with the women's soccer
team as the beat writer.

I c lieei ed with pride and a sense ol a<
coinplishment as Stanford knocked oil
major \( '.AA and Pacific 10 (.onfercnce
c oinpeiitoi s.
I he season opened with upsets ovei
Florida, I e\as A&M and Texas, fore ing
the couniiA to lake notice of the women
draped in Cardinal and white and living
on the I ai in.
\nd. I also felt heartbroken on several
oc c asions.
I he 2-1 overtime loss to Santa ( laia.
I he out of < harac ter and unexpec led
overtime loss to tin ranked Ai i/ona Stale.
I lie 1-0 loss to I CI.A thai crushed
Stanford's hopes of a Pat -10 title.
And finalK and mosi difficult to swal
low: the recent 1-0 loss to Texas A&M
that ended the ( animal's hopes ola De
cember in Dallas lot the 112 inal l our.

11 was supposed to be the opposite wa\
around, thanksgiving and Christinas
were supposed to he limes of'absolute jo\
for ( ardinal plavers and fans.
A post-1 hanksgiving victory celebra
tion ,ind .1 victon two weeks before
Christmas was how the season was sup
posed to be written.
Kut not this \ear. Fate would get in the
wa\ of the f.iir\ tale this time.
I he odds seemed stacked against .1
valid Stanford run at the Women's Col
lege ( up from the ven beginning.
I"he (ardinal endured one of the
most difficult conferences in the nation.
Stanford was tabbed to finish a dismal
fourth place in the Pac-I() at the begin
ning of the season.

Most of us don't ap

the rest of the world s —
and despite a recent

resurgence in the American public s ac
ceptance ol this sport, soccer plavers still
have a long wa\ to go before they become
so< ietal pop figures.
But I think it's important fbi Stanford
students and lacult\ to know how amaz

provocative its 2001 season was.
In other words, now that it's over, it's
time to reflect.
Personally, I've always thought it quite
strange that spectators can be so emo

However, I too fell vic tim to this psy
