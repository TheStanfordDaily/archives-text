# Oregon is BCS ugly duckling
## 
### 
(AP) — Even after two monu
mental upsets occurred oxer the
weekend, Oregon stayed at No. 5
in the Bowl Championship Series
standings released yesterday,
meaning the Ducks will have to
win the ( \\il War on Saturday and
get plenty of help from others to
get a shot at the national title.
"Not surprised, not disap
pointed," coach Mike Bellotti
said. "I certainly would like to be
higher, but I think we have to win
this last game. Thai's the most im
portant thing, and until we play a
game again I don't think we can
say much."
Ihe 1 )uc ks (9-1 overall. 6-1 I'a
c i lie 10 ( on lei enc e) have c line bed
ai least a share of the conference
championship and could win their
first outright title since 190 I with a
win ovei Oregon State at Autzen
Stadium in the lOiith Civil War.
Win oi lose, ()regon is guaranteed
no worse than a spot in the Fiesta
Bowl on New Year's Day, one of
the font big games in the B( IS.
Oregon, which hasn't played
since defeating I CLA 21-20 on
Nov 10, entered the holidax week
end with onlx <i fleeting chance of
using from No. 5 m the complex
B( S standings to the top two. I lie
teams at the top ol the filial list, to
be released Dec 0. will adxance to
the Rose Bowl to plax for the na
tional c hanipionship.
Plentx had to happen for the
Ducks to have such hopes. Fortu
natelx for them, plentx did.

Ducks. And the B( S computer,
which takes into account the writ
ers' and coat lies' polls, eight other
sets of rankings, strength of sched
ule and other factors, had Nebras
ka falling onl\ to fourth.
"I think the problem is not play
ing," Bel lot ti said. "I lad we played
and secured a victory, 1 think it
would have changed things. But
haying been idle for two weeks, it's
yen difficult. Sitting here watch
ing othei people determine our
fate. I'm tired of that. We're reads
to play."
As a consolation prize, Oregon
moved up a spot in the AP poll, re

State in last scar's (livil Wat
Miami is No. I on the BC.S list,
followed In Florida, Texas, Ne
braska, Oregon, Tennessee, Col
orado and Illinois.

"Miami and Florida ate in con
trol," said Jerry Palm, w ho operates
a Web site that closeh monitors the
BCS standings. "llOne falls, then
Texas and Tennessee are in the
best position, but it depends on
who else falls and how hard."
Palm said that Nebraska and
Oregon are still in the title chase,
"but would need a series of upsets
and then hope the computer
works in their lavoi ."
()ne benefit for the I)ucks is that
they're onl\ slightl\ behind Ne
braska (In ,;W points), and since
the Huskcrs don't have another
regular-season game, Oregon
could jump past them with a (oil
vine ing win over the Beavers.
II that happens, the only way
(hegoti could get to the Rose Bowl
is it two of the following three sce
