Yesterda\. a panel from the National Bu
reau ofKconotnic Research — including a
Stanford economics professor — made it of
ficial: the I niteel States econonn is in a re
cession that began last Match.
I his news comes alter recent anahsis of
the I S. econonn In the bureau's Business
C.vcle Dating Committee. I he committee i>«
comprised of six professors from ac ross the
country, including Stanford I\< otiomic s Prof.
Robert 11 all, who is also a member of the
I loover Institute. I lall c hairs the committee.
.According to the bureau's Web site, a re
cession is defined as a "signific ant decline in
activity spread across the econonn, lasting
more than a feu months, yisible in industrial
production, employment, real income and
wholesale-retail trade."
Recessions begin immediately after a peak,
in economic activit\ and end after activity
readies a trough.
I he committee's analysis dictates that this
recession has come after a peak of activity in
Match 2001. It comes on the heels of a
record 10-year period of economic expan
sion that began in March 1091, the longest
such period of growth in the bureau's
chronology.
I'he current recession is the 10th recession
since World War 11. tlu- most recent haying

Vllhough the Sept. II terrorist attacks art*

ing an already laltering economy.
"[Prior to Sept. 111 ii is possible that the
dc( line in thee( ononis would have been too
mild to (|iialif\ .is .1 recession." the bureau
stated on its Web site. " 1 lie attacks clearly
deepened the contraction and may have
been an important lac tor in turning the
episode into a recession."
Recently released employment data for
the month of Oc toher at e the first to show the
repercussions of Sept. 11 on the unemploy
ment rate. I he figures show that thus far in
ibis recession, unemployment is congruent
with the average rates of unemployment
from the previous seven recessions.
"Just a few vears ago, the present unem
ployment rate — between five and six per
cent — would have been considered full em
ployment," said Kconomics Prof. Gavin
Wright." I lie only way that I can see to view
the present |recession] as in any way serious
are the confounding ellec Is of the post-Sept.
1 I security and military situation."
"These may well .have effects on some
sectors, air travel being the most obvious,
that are more than temporary," Wright
added. "Bui predicting ibis sort of thing

goes well beyond conventional
economics."
Committee member Princeton
Economics Prof. Ben Bernanke
told Ihe New York limes that,
based on typical economic move
ment within recessions lasting six
to 18 months, "We would expect a
trough, beginning a recovery, by
| uly next year."
White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said that the official de
claration ol <i recession should
put pressure on lawmakers to
move rapitlh on a new economic
stimulus package. 1 lie bill lias
thus far been inching slowly
through Congress, thwarted bv
much contention.
President Bush told reporters
outside the White 1 louse, "1 knew
the econotm was not in good
shape tight after I took office."
I le. too, said he is hopeful that the
recession will force lawmakers to
agree on a package with renewed
expedient ) and efficiency.
