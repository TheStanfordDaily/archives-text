# Builders find century-old time capsule
## Construction workers uncovered Jane Stanford's 1898 time capsule under Building 160 
### SARA WEEKLY 
It all slatted more than a century ago,
when a small copper box was hidden in the
cornerstone of Building 160.
Jane Stanford, the University's founder,
buried a capsule that contained relics of her
time on Nov. 2, 1898, during a dedication c er
emony for the outer Quad.
The time capsule was soon forgotten â€”
until last July, when construction workers
struck a soft surface while placing new steel
supports at the foundation of the building as
part of a major structural renovation.

In that moment, the century-old time cap
sule was brought back into the Stanford
community.
The capsule, however, will not be opened
until the Founder s Day celebration on
April 7.
After the box was rushed to her office, Uni

items inside.

remained a secret, and Kimball said she in
tends to keep it that way until the time c apsule
is opened.
Until that time, students are encouraged to
guess its contents.
Although Jane Stanford never specified
what should be done with the capsule, Kim

ball and University President John Hennessy
agreed that it should be opened in public.
"My feeling once we found it was, let's
open it," Kimball said. She also said the box
was slightly damaged in the excavation
process, so the contents would have I Kiel to
have been removed lot repair anyway.
Kimball said ;i new capsule was already
buried, with modern-day contents, to replace
the old one. Its location, however, will not be
disclosed to the public.
"We had already thought of the idea of
placing our own time capsule, and [this
helped us decide] what form ii should take,"
said Laura (ioldstein. project manager of the
Building 100 renovation when the time cap
sule was uncovered.
"We felt [Jane's time capsule] was a tnes-
