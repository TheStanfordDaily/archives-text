I lie Managing Direclor ol the
State Department's Visa Office
recently announced that, due to
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it is
plac ing special requirements on
non-immigrant visa applications.
I hird country nationals, in
this case foreigners who are from
neither Mexico nor Canada, will
no longer be able to appl\ lor
their \ isas in those countries.
I his temporary measure could
force Stanford's international stu
dents to return to their home
countries to renew their 1- \ isas, or
student visas. This process poses
financial, logistical and safet\ is
sues to affected students.
I lie State Department Web
site explains that this decision
was made to prevent people
112 rom being held up in Mexico or
Canada while awaiting their
new visas.
"In order to avoid having
third countrv national visa appli
cants at our consular posts in
Mexico and ('.anada marooned in
those countries for lengthy peri
ods of time, U.S. visa processing

posts in Mexico and ( anada will
not accept non-immigrant visa
applications from non-residents
of those countries while these
special processing requirements
are in efleci." the Web site reads.
An appointment is necessan
to get a \isa from I S. consular
posts in Mexico and Canada.
Both countries have stopped
scheduling new appointments,
and while Mexico is still honor
ing appointments made prior to
this decision, Canada has can
celed all of its non-resident third
count r\ national appointments.
Rolando Villalohos. Assistant
Director of Foreign Students at
Stanford's Bechtel International
('enter, said that this is just a fur
ther inconvenience to Stanford's
international students.
" I here's never been any
guarantee that you can obtain a
visa from a country you're not a
resident of," he said. "There just
seems to be a tightening of the
bell here. Basically all it does is
force students to go back home."
Minal Mehta, President of the
I titer national I ndei graduate
Community, anticipates that this
will affect graduate students mote
severely than undergraduates be
cause their visas will expire sooner.
"For almost all the undergrads
I know, they all have five year
visas, so it's not much of an issue
for them," Mehta said.
However, she noted that this
will pose a difficulty for students
who do not have the financial re
sources to return to their home

countries to renew their visas or
for students who cannot leave in
the middle of the school sear.
Mehta also noted that the prob
lem is exacerbated by recent legis
lation which would disallow stu
dents from nations identified as
sponsoring terrorists from return
ing to the United States.
"I think another problem that
may come of this is that students
can't go back to their home coun
tries to get a \isa renewed, be
cause they won't be able to re
turn," she said.
Since November 19, the Bech

"Students, scholars and their
dependents traveling to Canada
