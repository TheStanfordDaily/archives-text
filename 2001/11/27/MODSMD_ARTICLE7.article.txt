# Medical Center tests disease warning system
## 
### ANTHONY HA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to the rising threat
of bioterrorist attacks, the Medical
('.enter is testing an early warning
system for suspicions disease out
breaks. The system, called Bio
threat Active Surveillance Inte
grated Information and Commu
nication System, was developed In
the Health Hero Network of
Mountain View.
BAS I ICS transmits medical in
formation about patients entering
the emergency room to local health
authorities. The data should take
nurses less than SO seconds to enter
but will provide few details about
the specific case.
Nonetheless, doctors hope that
there will be enough information to
identify broad trends that merit
further investigation.
Dr. trie A. Weiss, chair of the
Medical (.enter's Bioterrorism
and Emergency Preparedness
Task Force, warned that the ef
fectiveness of the system is ( in -
tently uncertain.
"The Public I lealth Department
is not vet capable of collating and

extrapolating the information, and
the) are not sure how manv cases oi
flu-like illness it takes before the\
should even become concerned."
he said.
Weiss added that the usefulness
of the system may remain unclear
after such standards are estab
lished, because other medical fin ili
ties have not vet begun testing it.
I le also noted that Stanford is look
ing .it wavs to spot disease out
breaks before people start seeking
help in emergency rooms.
"Kxamples are absenteeism
from work and s( hool ot patterns
of pharmacy purchases," he said.
"The Cryptosporidium epidemic
in Milwaukee was picked up
when pharmacies reported run
ning out of Immodium, a drug
that treats diarrhea."
BAM ICS is only one part of a
broader effort bv Stanford to exam
ine and, il neccssarv, revise, all as
pects of disaster planning.
"We need to be prepared for
more'predictable'disasters, such as
earthquakes, fires |and| chemical
spills, as well as those that are not
