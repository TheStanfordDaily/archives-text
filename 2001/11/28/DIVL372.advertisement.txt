Who owns academic work? I his question is
provoking political and legal battles, fought on
uncertain terrain, for ever-higher stakes. All but
forgotten in these ownership disputes is a more
fundamental question: Should academic work
be owned at all? Drawing on legal, historical
and qualitative research, Corynne McSherry
explores the propertization of academic work
and shows how that process is shaking the
foundations of the university, the professiorate
and intellectual property law.
