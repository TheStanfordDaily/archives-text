1936
()n Nov. 25, I<M>, I'he Daily printed an
stor\ about a now telescope being built on
Ml. Palomar:
"Dr. Walter s. Adams, director of the Mt.
Wilson Astronomical ()bservatory, spoke to
a large audience in the Assembly I lall last
night on the new 1200-inch telescope that is
being constructed lor the observatory now
being built on Mt. I'alomar.
"The mirror, over one foot across, has a
round hole M) indies in diameter in the
( enter. b\ means ol this opening, the toeal
length ol the lens ma\ be in< teased beyond
its ordinarv length of 500 feet.
"The purpose of the mirror is to show
the more distant bodies and stellat svstems
with greater (lai it\. it would be of little use,
at (< tiding to I)i Adams, to bring the bodies
of our own solar svsteni closer: they would
mereh become more indistinct, due to the
varied currents in the atmosphere.'
Bottom Line: The telescope would probably have
been unnecessary for those meteor showers the
other niqht.
