A crucial gene involved in the de
velopment of multiple sclerosis has
been identified by researchers at
Stanford University Medical Center
and UC- San Francisco.
The gene, osteopontin, is already
known to be a factor in the inflam
matory immune response character
istic of MS. However.; now re
searchers believe it may be posi
tioned at a number of checkpoints
in the progression of the disease.
The findings could lead to target
ed new therapies for MS, which af
fects about one million people
worldwide. The disease is incur
able, and the cause is unknown.
Dr. Larry Steinman, professor of
neurology at Stanford, and Jorge
Oksenberg, associate professor of
neurology at UC-San Francisco, ex
amined autopsied brains from MS
patients to learn more about the
disease.
Steinman and Oksenberg shared
senior authorship on a paper ex
plaining their findings, which ap
pears in the latest issue of Science.
— from the Nov. 23 issue of the
Los Angeles Times.
