# Students raise privacy awareness
## 
### KATHERINE KELMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of students is working to in
form the Stanford community about a
number of little-known issues and con
cerns surrounding student privacy.
1 he Stanford Student Computer and
Network Privacy Project has assembled a
Web site containing specifics and conclu
sions of a pilot study the students con
cha ted last spring. It also features infor
mation about Stanford's privacy policies
and general student privacy issues.
lhe student-run project grew out of a
course, "Information Technology in So
ciety: Legal and Policy Perspectives,"
taught last spring by Dr. Barbara Simons.
Participants of the course examined
many technology-related issues, among
them computer and network privacy.
l he students' pilot study emerged, ac
cording to the project site, "upon our re
alization that very little was known about
privacy on the Stanford campus."
Computer science graduate student

Kuchika Agrawal, the organization's
president, created the site this summer
with the help of Simons as an advisor.
"Awareness is really important â€” it's
in itself a huge step," Agrawal said. "Some
of (the information on the Web site] is
pretty obvious, hut it's something people
should be mindful of."
Phe site recommends revealing less
personal information 011 Web spaces, uti
lizing "Stanford.Who" to control what in
formation is shared and being cautious
when using cluster computers. I In- pro
ject also explains that e-mail is not a se
cure authenticated system.
It includes a list of current security
risks, information on future policy and
news material on developments such .is
the anti-terrorism legislation being de
bated in Congress.
Agrawal explained ili.it she and Si
mons came to a decision to expand the
project in the summer and asked other
students to participate. Together, the
group and Simons consolidated tlu- ini
tial pilot study to form the core of the site.

After surveying 120 students, the
study tbund that most knew little about
their privacy rights and the extent to
which they can be endangered.
It also examined the adequacy of fed
eral, as well as Stanford's own, laws and
policies of privacy protection.
"None of the laws and policies dis
cussed serve well to adequately protect
student privacy," said the project's site.
In response to the University's plans to
amend existing privacy polic y, the study's
organi/ers drafted their own recommen
dations on how to improve protection.
1 hey suggest "greater emphasis on
increasing awareness of student privacy
issues through literature distribution
and funding."
Accordingly, the project included the
abstract of the stud\ in the orientation
packets received by ;ill of this year's in
coming students.
"We also plan to do a broader surve\
to gauge students' willingness to forgo
(onvenience in favor of increased privai v
protection," Agrawal said.
