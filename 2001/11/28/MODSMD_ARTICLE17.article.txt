For students interested in the largest
women's scholarship program in the
world, sophomore Lauren Chan, the
current Miss Los Altos crown holder,
will discuss her experiences with the
Miss America pageant system in a talk
this evening.
"When you are chosen to be a repre
sentative. the program gives you the
unique opportunity to promote an issue
of your choosing in a national forum,"
said C. H. Armour, Miss Los Altos / Red
wood C.it\ executive director.
I itleholdersare required to pursue a
philanthropic platform; Chan chose the
Alliance to Inspire through Music.
" I he concept [of the alliance] is to
build .t network of arts outreach organi
zations in the community to . . . help
lend guidance to individual organiza
tions." ('.ban said. " I o this end. 1 am in
volved in several activities at Stanford,
including the Stanford Concert Net
work and the Stanford Alliance for Ser
vice through the Arts."
An ASS I'-funded student organiza
tion, the Concert Network brings live
music to Stanford, "but not necessarily
(l.issii al music." ('ban said. "Music is for
everybody."
As the network's intern manager,
Chan provides education for interns,
who are chosen from applicants in
terested in music and music
production.
I he interns have visited and met

with music industry insiders and will be
shadowing SCN start'members.
As an umbrella arts organization at
Stanford, SASTA runs programs like
Lively Arts and the Senior Out reach
Concert Series.
"Lauren helps us form partnerships
with other organizations throughout
campus ,iiul organize events both on
the SAS LA level and with other organi
zations," said senior Liz Dzeng, chair of
SAS'IA.
Chan said she is planning a spring
conference that brings together the
work of SASTA volunteers and
students.
"1 lopefully, I will be able to make this
a big thing and even get people from
Foothill (College] and the surrounding
community involved," she said.
Stanford lias historically had a strong
presence in the Miss America pageant.
Most notably, Rita Ng, Class of 2000,
was second runner-up in the pageant
and earned $52,000 in scholarship
money, which now contributes to her
tuition at I CSF Medical School.
"1 think it is important to recruit at
Stanford for this event because it is es
sential to have a good group of girls step
up and take initiative in this forum,"
said Chan.
"I found many ways to use the crown
and take advantage of this opportunity
to promote causes tli.it I think are real
ly important," Chan added.
(]han has made appearances at other
California pageants, including Miss
Sonoma, Miss Lake County and Mi>s
Asian America, in addition to philan
thropic events like the Muscular Dys
trophy Association fundraisers in San
Francisco and Redwood City.
