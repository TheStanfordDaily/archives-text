## The 						Stanford Daily University must resist discriminatory visa reforms 
### 
On Monday, students and faculty
staged a rally in White Plaza
against the Visa Kntry Reform Act
2001, proposed by Sen. Diane Fe
instein ol ( alifoi nia. (oming on the heels ol
the State Department's recent decision to
place special requirements on non-immi
grant visa applications, this rally highlighted
the undue hardships being placed on inter
national students lor no other reason than
their foreign status.
We commend the reaction of our student
hod\ and administration and join them in
questioning the necessity and legitimacy of
these policies. Furthei more, we urge the Uni
versity to resist, whenevei legalh possible, in
vasivc federal interference with the academic
experience of am student, espccialh interna
tional students.
Though the Stale Department's new visa

policy is temporary, it makes the process of re
newing international student visas incredibly
burdensome for an indefinite period of time.
I his new measure may force students to re
turn to theii home countries to renew their
visas, in addition to coping with the current
red tape inherent in the visa renewal process.
1 Ins requirement seems entirely unnecessary
and extreme. Furthermore, we question how
the policy serves to substantively reduce the
risk of terrorism.
I he Visa F.ntrv Reform Act is more focused
in its purported reaction against terrorism,
but its stipulations smack ol racial profiling.
1 lie bill would prohibit students from so
tailed "terrorist-supporting states" of North
Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and
(.üba 112 rom obtaining visas.
While these countries may indeed be
home to terrorist organizations, they are also

home to a multitude ol other people who do
not support, or who actively oppose, terror
ist acts and groups. In lad, terrorist groups
represent the ideology ol only a small por
tion ol these populations, as illustrated by the
situation in Afghanistan.
1 'litis, such restrictions would alfect the cit
izens whose only crime was living in an un
stable political environment far more than
they would ail) terrorist organizations. For
this reason, this hill is both impractical and
discriminatory. Finally, it seems ignorant and
naive to assume th.it all people from a certain
nation are potential threats, while anyone
else is deemed harmless.
1 his is not to say that the concerns behind
these government policies are totally un
founded, but rather that knee-jerk reactions
like Fcinstcin's proposed act are not the most
productive or effective means of responding

to tlu- abuse of student visa privileges by for
eign nationals.
Instead of stereotyping individuals based
on their nationality, perhaps the government
could extend and improve the background
checks that are already in place within the
student visa application process. 1 he Immi
gration and Naturalization Service needs the
resources to evaluate applicants on an indi
vidual basis rather than restricting them
based on a single characteristic.
In light ol these concerns, it is imperative
that the student body and administration, as
a part ola high-profile university, voice op
position to these governmental policies. It is
the I 'niversity s duty to protect its students
from any persecution they incur solely as a
result of their student status and academic
inclinations. Rallies such .is the one held on
Monday are just a start.
