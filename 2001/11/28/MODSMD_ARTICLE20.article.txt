Fundamentalist beliefs aside. Harry
Potter's themes are very good lessons.
Filey are perfectly consonant with main
stream ideas in Christianity and, for that

important theme in Harry Potter is also
supreme in Judeo-Christianity: the power
of love. I lie original source of I larry's love
is his i not her. Iu the( )ld I est anient, we.u e
reminded tt> love (iod, our neighbors and
ourselves (Leviticus 19:18: "Love your

self). Love is the supreme principle of
Judeo-Christianity. I lie love of Harry 's
mother is just as sweet.
In the end, wizardry is a paper tiger. It
poses no threat to Judeo-Christianity be
cause there's no institutional framework
for passing on necromancy, magic or sor
cery. Amateur Web sites and annual con
ferences are no competition for the institu
tional churches, synagogues, universities
and schools of Judeo-Christianity. There
are 1.100 adult pagans in California, but
that's a drop in the bucket in a state with 3-1
million people. At worst. Harry Potter will
distract us from unimaginative cubicles,
desksand oflices. At best, he'll remind us of
the importance of core values such as love,
faith and hope. Paul wrote that "the great
est of these is love" (1 Corinthians 13:13).

family themes.
American fundamentalists have a right
to be angry. According to their literal in
terpretation of the Bible (sans context),
there are clear prohibitions against magic.
Leviticus 19:31 warns: "Do not turn to
mediums or wizards; do not seek them out,

Fundamentalist beliefs aside. Harry
Potter's themes are very good lessons.
Filey are perfectly consonant with main
stream ideas in Christianity and, for that
matter, other world religions. Ihe most
important theme in Harry Potter is also
supreme in Judeo-Christianity: the power
of love. I lie original source of I larry's love
is his i not her. Iu the( )ld I est anient, we.u e
reminded tt> love (iod, our neighbors and
ourselves (Leviticus 19:18: "Love your
neighbor as yourself"). Ihe same com
niandnients are pronounced in the New
testament (Mark 12:30-31: "You shall
love the I .ord your (lod with all your heart.
. . . You shall love your neighbor as your
self). Love is the supreme principle of
Judeo-Christianity. I lie love of Harry 's
mother is just as sweet.
In the end, wizardry is a paper tiger. It
poses no threat to Judeo-Christianity be
cause there's no institutional framework
for passing on necromancy, magic or sor
cery. Amateur Web sites and annual con
ferences are no competition for the institu
tional churches, synagogues, universities
and schools of Judeo-Christianity. There
are 1.100 adult pagans in California, but
that's a drop in the bucket in a state with 3-1
million people. At worst. Harry Potter will
distract us from unimaginative cubicles,
desksand oflices. At best, he'll remind us of
the importance of core values such as love,
faith and hope. Paul wrote that "the great
est of these is love" (1 Corinthians 13:13).
So did J.K. Rowling.
