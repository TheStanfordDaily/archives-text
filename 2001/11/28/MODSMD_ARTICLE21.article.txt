The history of Stanford's
ROTC opposition
Like most student papers, I lie St.in
fold Daily is decidedly independent,
which is line so long as it acts responsibh
It and the Stanford Review are important
sources of independent information and
opinions. At Stanford, because of student
pressure, the R( )T(' is banned, as at other
elite universities. I lie two facts have an in
teresting common background.
President Herbert Hoover, a peace
loving Quaker, had vigorously support
ed YVoodrow Wilson in his unsuccessful
campaign to get the I nited States to join
the League of Nations. He was still light
ing the good light for peace when an
event at Stanford hit him like a bomb
shell. His dislike of militarism had been
evident during a public argument about
rowdy student behavior at Stanford.
I here was a proposal to name a military
man as University president so that dis
cipline could be enforced, as at some
other American universities. Hoover
strongly opposed the idea, so Stanford
maintained its record of having civilian
academics as presidents.
He was presumably at odds with his
older brother Theodore, who had made
a fortune in mining in Australia, come to
Stanford, and been made dean of engi
neering. His ideas must have been dif
ferent from those of his younger broth
er, since he was a strong backer of the
ROTC. on campus.
11 ere is an extract from his syllabus for
Mining and Metallurgy 101: "The
human race develops by war, and suc

ceeds in war in proportion to its use of
metals; races perish in peace. C.ulture in
increased b\ invention ol new weapons.
I he pacifist ens in assuming that peace
is desirable. Kmerson said ever) thing we
have must be paid for. We Americans are
living in unpaid luxury and must pa\ in
the future by blood and hard vvoi k."
Strange words for the syllabus of a
technical course. He sounded like a
spokesman for the military-industrial
complex at a time when dictators allied
with the military were taking over vari
ous countries.
Was there talk of a military govern
ment? Stanford students had long feared
that Stanford would have one, and. on
May 15, 1930, I he Daily published the
above quotation, describing Theodore
1 loover's views as "a shocking manifesta
tion of militarism on a campus where
men and women are supposed to think
in terms of humanity."
I he student editor, Robert Speers,
demanded th.it the School of Engineer
ing (i.e., Theodore Hoover) "wipe out
this statement at once. "'The result was a
national uproar. Theodore Hoover an
grily defended himself, accusing Speers
of "flagrant violation" of the inviolability
of the classroom. A group of engineering
students attempted unsuccessfully to
kidnap Speers. President Hoover was
embarrassed, and Ray Lyman Wilbur,
his close friend and Secretary of the In
terior, issued a statement essentially sup
porting Theodore Hoover's charge
against Speers.
The acting president of the Universi
ty, Robert K. Swain, dutilullv echoed

Wilbur's statement and implied that
Speers could he expelled from the uni
versity. Speers retorted that he had acted
in good faith and that the quotation was
taken from a published syllabus.
Swain then urged Theodore Hoover
to avoid further comment. I lie incident
scared many faculty members who "re
treated intoa shell of prudent reticence."
Campus suspic ion of the ROTC and
its ultimate banning goes back to this in
cident. Stanford ROTC students now
take their RO IC, t lasses at, of .ill places,
UC-Berkeley, which kept ROTC
through all the troubles. Is this an honest
solution? At least the independence of
I he Daily was affirmed, thank heavens!
