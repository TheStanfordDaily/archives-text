I hough most questions and responses
at the led lire were quite genet al, he pro
vided much greater insight about his
book during a peisonal interview with
I lie I)ail\.
I here li.is been ,i lot ol criticism ol the
woi k. but the l'ulil/er I't i/e-winning book
has numerous supporters .ts well. I lie

message that rate is not the reason popu
lations developed dillerenth is welcomed
in the politically correct atmosphere ol
modern times.
"Primarily the book is about win soci
eties developed dillerenth on diflerent
continents." Diamond said. "And ni\ con
clusion is that it has nothing to do with race
or human biology. Ii has everything to do
with environment.
I he book is a work ol populai s< ience
information about specifu areas ol
s( ientilic findings presented to the gen
eral public.
"f.ssentialh, [ I w rote it for] everv edu
cated person in the world," Diamond
s.iid. "It's aimed at the general public. I
had to have the technical details ( orrec t.
otherwise academics would sa\. 'Dia
mond doesn't understand the origins ol
agriculture in the Fertile C.rescent. Ills
book is all wrong." I lie reviews would
(discredit it | and the public would nevei
have read it. But the writing st\le is
aimed at the general public, aimed at
people all at loss the world. | l-'or | as main
people as would be able to read it
Because the work encompasses I 3,000
vears ol history, there are obvioush de
tails that liave been omitted.
"M\ initial manuscript was (>f>() pages,"
Diamond s.iid. "M\ publishei said cut it
down to 450 pages. I did and there were
some things I cut out."
It is the lack of certain details that has
drawn the most criticism. One detail that

seems lo be missing, according to critics,
is the human element. It is claimed that
Diamond inaccurately separates geogra
phy Iron) the cultural aspect of develop
ing societies.
"People often make the mistake ol say
ing I'm ignoring the cultural-human ele
ment, but in (act the reason we're sitting
here vvitli tape recorders is entirely that ol
culture," Diamond said, "li s all.a matter
ol cultural learning since then, but it's a
question ol why that cultural learning
took pi.u e in some areas ol the world, but
not others."
Also, it has been said th.it individuals
(.in ailed historv, hut Diamond again
< ounters that point.
"Individuals can have great impact
over short times, but ovei long times, like
over 13,000 years. 1 don't think the indi
vidual has any impact."' he said. "()ne can
argue about the number up to which indi
viduals have an influence. I he\ certainlv
have an intluencc that lasts 10 or 15 years.
11it \ certainly don't have an influence
that lasts 3,000 years."
As the conversation continued, the
topic ol the events of Sept. II surfaced.
"I hi match, there was an environmen
tal component to Sept. II." said Dia
mond. "II \ou look at where political in
stabilit \ and terrorism exist in the modern
world. the\ exist especially in over-popu
lated. environmental!) -fragile countries,
so the world's tinder'boxes todav are the
places tli.it ecologists would label either

the most environmentally-damaged or
overpopulated. Afghanistan is land
lot ked. overgrazed for thousands of
years, as are Somalia, Rwanda the former
Yugoslavia and ilic Middle Kast.
"In that sense, there's an environmen
tal component to Sept. 11. In the long
run, I think that's going to be the most
important in the aftermath of Sept 1 I; we
Americans no longer can have the attitude
that just as long .is we keep things ok.i\ in
the I nited States, it's tough luck for those
people out there in their own countries
who do stupid things."
Diamond also addressed how he would
handle the crisis if he were President.
"11l were in power, it is eas\ to see that
in the long i un. we have to reduce cli .isti
cally our dependence on imported Mid
dle Kast oil," Diamond said. " I lie second
thing 1 would do would be to consider so
called foreign aid programs not as c hai itv
that we generouslv give to other people,
but as. in part, interests that we .ire pursu
ing lor ourselves around the world be
cause— nowaclavs with globalization —
we are sensitive to what's going on
throughout the world. I lie two long-term
issues are ensuring the welfare ol the rest
of the world and drastically decreasing
our energy requirement. Unit's the e.is\
part. I'he hard part is to figure out what
we need to do in the short run."
1 he primary reaction in the I nited
States li.is been continuing bombing and
military operations in Afghanistan.

" Thereare two extremes [ol responses]
which arc equalh dangerous," Diamond
said. "It is equally dangerous to overreact
and make too many enemies with bomb
ing. And, it's equally dangerous to do
nothing, showing that people can kill
thousands <>1 Americans and we lie back
and do nothing. It is the latter danger —
doing nothing — that caused World War
11. 1 hat is what happened in the 19305.
Overreacting, one can s.i\, is what hap
pened in Vietnam."
Yet, it is not onh the I nitcd States
that must take action. "One could start
In saving it is the responsibility ol the
richer counties generalK —not just the
I S., but .ilso |apan. Kngland, other
richer counties — to ensure the well
being ol poorer counties," Diamond
said. "I would su\ it's now in the self-in
terest ol the richer countries."
But, according to Diamond, it is im
portant not to appeal to be yielding to the
ads ol terror perpetrated against the
I nitecl States.
" There's some delicacy here," Dia
mond said. "In essence, though you're
saving, 4 ife\ il people want us to do a good
thing in our sell-interest, should we not
do that good thing"-' ()l course not. There
is some delicac \ in how we do it. It can not
be clone in .1 wa\ that seems to reward ter
rorists. Instead, it needs to be part ola big
ger polio helping everyone in the world,
raise the standard ol living evervwhere in
the world."
