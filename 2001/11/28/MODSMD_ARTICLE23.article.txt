Q: I got so sleepy after Thanksgiv
ing dinner (his year. Answer Girl. I
just wanted to sit there, without mov
ing, for the longest time! I think I
heard somewhere that it's the turkey
. . . does eating turkey really make
you sleepy?
A: Looking for.in excuse to get out
of doing dishes after the meal? I'm not
100 sure that you can blame the turkey.
I urkc\ normal!) gets the blame
because ii contains L-tryptophan, a
natural sedative. It's a normal con
stituent of turkey llesh, and is often
\ iewed as the cause of a certain sleepi
ness common to the post-turkey
I hanksgiving crowd.
II lis amino acid is a component of
mail) plant and animal proteins and a
normal part of the diet that humans
must get from outside sources. It is

also the starting material from which
the brain makes serotonin, which
calms you down and makes you sleeps.
L-tryptophan was a very popular
sleeping aid in the United States until
recently and was also used for pre
menstrual syndrome and depression.
But the Food and Drug Administra
tion pulled it off the market in 1900
because of a sudden outbreak of
eosi nop hi lie- myalgia synd tome
among people who had taken the sup
plement. About 5,000 people got sick
and I J7 died from the supplement.
But don't worry about that too
much. If you're looking for the seda
tive effect, it's unlikely you'll get it
from eating meats like turkey. L-tryp
tophan doesn't act on the brain unless
you take it on an empty stomach with
no protein present.
So 1 don't think the amino acid is to
blame for tin- sudden lethargy that hits
just about when it's time to do dishes.
That's more likely due to drinking alco
hol and overeating — not just turkey,
but mashed potatoes, cranberries, yams,
peas, carrots, bread, pies and whipped
cream, which pulls all the blood away
from your brain as your stomach begins
the arduous task of digesting an over
load. Sony, but you're going to have to
stan looking fora new excuse!
