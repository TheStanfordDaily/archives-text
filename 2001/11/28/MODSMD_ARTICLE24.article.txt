FIRST LIGHT: Astrophysicists re
port that the first light in the universe
probabh came a lew hundred years
alter its creation, from stars approxi
mately a hundred times more massive
than our sun. I he universe is be
lieved to have been created in the Big
Bang 12 billion years ago. Following
that unparalleled explosion, clouds ol
gases and dark matter arose from the
mixture ol radiation and subatomic
particles.
I lie scientists say that when the
(louds ol gas reached .1 ci itical mass and
underwent a gravitational implosion, gi
gantic and brilliant stars unique from
those extant today were formed. All the
early stars have long since died in super
novae. I he researchers — Tom Abel of
the I larvard-Sinithsonian ('.enter for As
trophysics and Britain's Cambridge In
stitute of Astronomy, Michael Norman
of the I C-San Diego and Greg Bryan of

lation carried out on a supercomputer at
the I niversit\ of Illinois.
GESTURING FACILITATES
MEMORY: I Nvchologistsat the I niver
sit\ of Chicago report that gesturing
while talking seems to help the brain si
multaneously perform other tasks, such
as remembering a list. I he researchers
had almost 100 subjects — including
both adults and children—explain a
math problem, either while allowed to
gesture or while instructed to keep their
hands still. Gesturing while explaining
the problem improved the abilit\ to re
call a previously memorized list of num
bers or letters.
In addition to data from the experi
ment, the idea that gesturing helps not
just listeners but also the speaker is sup
ported by the fact that blind people ges
ture when talking to other blind people.
I he researchers on the present experi
ment, Susan Golditi-Meadow. Howard
Nusbaum. Spencer Kelly and Susan
Wagner, suggest that gesturing works

with tlic part ol the brain responsible lor
visual and spatial subject matter.
STATUES OF ASH OKA FOUND:
Indian archaeologists have dug up two
,tin it-lit statues of the lamed Emperor
Ashoka. I he statues, thought bv some to
be the first primary depictions of the
ruler found in modern times, were dis
covered in Orissa, .1 state in the eastern
part ol India. One statue portrays
Ashoka pra\ ing and the other shows him
with his wife.
Horn around 300 N.C.F., Ashoka was
the third ruler of the Maurvan dynasty.
He enlarged his kingdom through many
wars, but after .1 hideous conquest of
kalinga, lit- renounced violence and be
came .1 committed Buddhist. For the re
mainder of his reign, he propagated virtue
and inscribed edicts on rocks and pillars
throughout modern dav India, Nepal,
Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hie discovery
of the statues is timely: fiesides the many
