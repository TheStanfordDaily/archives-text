# Internet library necessary before more is lost
## 
### MICHAEL M. SHAPIRO 
While the Internet oilers an incred
ible wealth of information, it also raises
several difficult problems that must be
addressed by tlie U.S. citizenry and
government. One problem is the lack
ola bat knp system for items that are
posted and then removed from cyber
space. I'm not so much concerned
about I ncle Joe 01 Aunt Sue choosing
to take down their favorite recipe for
truffles, thus denying the world the
pleasure of their gourmet cooking se
crets. Rather, I believe something must
be done to preserve the millions of ar
ticles that are on the Internet are are
cited in research and other forms of
commentary.
Think about it. You decide to write a
paper about the Roman Empire. You go
to Green Library, pick up some books

and begin your research. Then you
jump online and find some great articles
in several journals that are only available
online. You then write your paper citing
both the books and the journals. You've
done a great job â€” you have written an
excellent paper, backed up by credible
sources. It's so good that it's posted by
the I listory Department of Stanford on a
Web site dedicated to the best essays
written by Stanford students in the past
50 years.
So, now it's 10 years later. An inquisi
tive freshman decides to write about the
Roman Empire. A helpful professor in
the History Department recommends
that she read your epic work. She pulls
your work oil the Internet. She begins
reading and clicks on the source listed for
a critical sentence of the essay. Up pops a
screen, " The URL www.romanhisto
ryjournal.org is no longer in service." She

laughs nervously and proceeds to Green
Library to find the journal. The Green li
brarian informs our little history buffthat
the journal is no longer in existence be
cause it had only been located on the In
ternet. Troubled, but not dismayed, she
returns to the paper and begins searching
the other sources. Each time she clicks, a
screen pops up, each time indicating that
another source is no longer in service.
Well, you get the picture.
Many of the world's finest academi
cians are now publishing their writ
ings only online and only on Web sites
that may be out of existence in less
than 10 years. Some of the best writ
ing will be lost to the world if some
thing is not done about it. Not only
that, but any paper, speech or docu
ment that cites an online source that
is no longer in existence will lose
credibility and some of its most com

polling corroboration.
1 know all of yon arc praying for such
a thing to never occur, but, alas, it is al
ready occurring every day! As a mem
ber of a journal at the Law School, I've
encountered citations for sources that
no longer exist in writings that are less
than a year old. But, all is not lost ... at
least, not yet.
It is time for the U.S. Library of Con
gress to begin cataloguing .ill academic
writings posted on the internet and put
them in a searchable database. Impossi
ble? Probably. Illegal? Maybe. While
there are a few current private efforts to
create internet libraries (including
Brewster kahle's Internet Archive),
these sites lack adequate search capabili
ties and resources, efficient submission
of materials and may run afoul of copy
rights laws.
I propose that the Library of Con

gress oiler every publisher the oppor
tunity to preserve his or her internet
contributions with the library of Con
gress in a searchable database, alter
which the contributions will be re
moved from the internet. I he Library
would have discretion about what
items to include in the catalogue, re
stricting such items to academic and
educational uses, with appropriate
content restrictions. Kach publisher, at
his discretion, would license their in
ternet work to the Library for free,
thereby eliminating any legal issues.
Would this be time consuming? Yes.
Would it be expensive? Yes. Has such
an idea been proposed before? Let's see
. . . here's something on the subject. . .
here's a citation for it . . . let's click on it
. . . oh ..." 1 HE URL www.internetli
brary.gov is no longer in service." I
guess we'll never know.
