# The
						perennial powerhouses have fallen
## 
### 
Alter watching the jam-packed
I hanksgiving weekend of spoils, 1
have come away with one start ling re
alization about the sports world in
general — oh, how the mighty have fallen.
From the NFL, to college football, to the
NB \. stoi ied franchises arc being embarrassed.

traditions are being flushed
down the toilet. Years and
vears of titles, gone.
Just think of it this xvax. fen
vears ago, or even five years
ago, if I had told vou that the
Dallas Cowboys would cur
rent l\ be 2-H. the ('.hicago Hulls
1-1 I and Notre Dame 4-0,
what would vou s.ix? ()dds are,

you would probabh it'll me to shul the hell up
and lay oil the crack.
flic Dallas Cowboys, how could iliev be
one of the worst teams in the league? Do the
names I roy Aikmau, Fmmitt Smith or
Michael Irvin ring a bell? W hat about Roger
Staubach oi 1 on\ Dorselt? Flic Cowboys are
supposed to be Anicrii as team, for cr\ ing out
loud. Well, 1 don't think the good-ole U.S. of
A. is going to lax claim to this sad excuse for an

Ni l.squad. We might as well hand them over
to Yemen or Belize. Mavbe thex'll want to
make the ('.oxvbo\ s their team. I hexd have to
handle the extradition of Nate Newton
though, who just got arrested with 21 3
pounds of pot in his ti uuk. I'm not sure what
the laws are in other countries, but that just
might constitute "intent to sell."
Surprisinglv, the Cowbovs are not the most
embarrassing team in professional sports right
now. 1 hey can thank the Hulls for that, a team
that has the worst tecord in the NHA, just three
years after winning their third consecutive
championship, and their fifth tit It* of the '90s.
I hope you said goodbye to Jordan, Pippeti
and Rodman, fliese are the daxs of I renton
Hassell, Creg Anihonx and Marcus Fi/.cr —
names that must reallx strike leal in the hearts
of opponents. Hut it's ok. Phil Jackson w ill find
some wa\ to mold these guys into a winning
team. Oh, I forgot, lie's out in F.A. getting
some more c hampionship rings with k<>be and
Shati. Cood luck, I im Floyil.
lo be honest, 1 hadn't seen just how bad the
Hulls reallx are until this past Saturday when
they laced mx Knicks at Madison Square Car
den. 1 he pathetic state of the Kni< ks is <i w hole

othei storx .but the Bulls got whipped bv a team
that siai is felt on Spencet at i enter. Yeah, that's
right, Felton Spencer — the same tub of lard
thai <>n<e got (lit In the (Jolden State Warriors.
II you can believe it, there are stories like this
all over the NBA Perennial contenders in the
Knicks, the Jazz and the Heat all have losing
11-( ords, x\ hile the team led by a certain No. 23
is .is( arx 3-9. What about the biggest stars of the
'90s, arguabh the best players of their genera
tion? ()ut of the seven members oft lie infamous
Dream leain that still play in the league
(Michael Jordan, Scot lie Pippen, Patrick
Fxxing, David Robinson, John Stockton, Karl
Malone — and who can forget Christian Faet
tner), only one, Robinson, is on a team with a
winning record.
I hink about that.
We're talking about the Dream Team, the
stars that captivated the entire world and be
came international celebrities. The team of
supt'i -heroes that made oceans part and moun
tains crumble.
Well, it's a dream no longer.
It's more like a nightmare, as these fading
