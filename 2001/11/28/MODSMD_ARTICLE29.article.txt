## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the No. 3 Stanford men's
soccer team began its quest to
reach the final lour, the team's
leading scorer and Pacific 10
Conference Player of the- Year,
junior Roger Levesque, sat in
the stands Sunda\ watching his
team fight it out against Bay
Area rival Santa (Mara on
muddy New Maloney Field.
After receiving a red card in
the Cardinal's final conference
game against Oregon State,
Levesque was ejected from the
team's first NCAA tournament
match. Because the Cardinal
had earned a bye in the first
round, Levesque was forced to
watch the crucial second-round

game 112 rom the stands.
"Roger has been very im
portant to our team this year,"
said senior co-captain Lee
Morrison. "When we knew
he'd be gone we knew that
someone else would have to
pick up their game."
I lu* man picked to fill the
gap up front was redshirt fresh
man Matt [anus/. He stepped
up and tilled in for the junior in
the best wav he could — to train
as Levesque would train and to
play as Levesque would play.
"The freshmen who filled in
for him on Sunday imitated his
style of play and his work ethic
throughout the week." said St.in
fold head coach Bret Simon.
