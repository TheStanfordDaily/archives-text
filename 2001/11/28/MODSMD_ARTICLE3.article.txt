Current I). when Stanford students need a lilt- —
be it a niusii, mm ie 01 text file — ehances are the\
have to (onnect to off-campus < omputers to obtain
th.it file. Hut .ill that c ould be t hanging, thanks to a
uni(]uelv-named program tailed Cuutclla.
About si\ weeks ago, Kthan Rikleen, network
and systems administrator for the Office of Resi
dential Computing, started an experiment b\
launching gnutclla.stanford.edu, a Stanford
(Inutella server within the Cuutclla network.
I lie (iiiutella network is a peer-to-peer network
that allows computers to share files directh with
one another, through the Cuutclla network, a
computer keeps in constant contact with several
computers that arc also connected to the network.
I he idea is to allow users searching fora file to
have their request passed on to main computers
at once.
Rikleen describes the Cuutclla network .is a s<>-
(ial circle.
"You have a certain number of Iriends on vour

speed di.il whom you ciill when you have .1 [>art \."
lu* said. " I o get more people to tome to \out par
lies. you (ouslanth update your speed dials with
people u ho know the most othei people. I hat way,
the social butterflies 011 your speed dial will invite
tons <>l people.
