# New file-sharing program promises faster downloads & reduced network traffic
## Nutty for Gnutella

Current I). when Stanford students need a lilt- —
be it a niusii, mm ie 01 text file — ehances are the\
have to (onnect to off-campus < omputers to obtain
th.it file. Hut .ill that c ould be t hanging, thanks to a
uni(]uelv-named program tailed Cuutclla.
About si\ weeks ago, Kthan Rikleen, network
and systems administrator for the Office of Resi
dential Computing, started an experiment b\
launching gnutclla.stanford.edu, a Stanford
(Inutella server within the Cuutclla network.
I lie (iiiutella network is a peer-to-peer network
that allows computers to share files directh with
one another, through the Cuutclla network, a
computer keeps in constant contact with several
computers that arc also connected to the network.
I he idea is to allow users searching fora file to
have their request passed on to main computers
at once.
Rikleen describes the Cuutclla network .is a s<>-
(ial circle.
"You have a certain number of Iriends on vour

speed di.il whom you ciill when you have .1 [>art \."
lu* said. " I o get more people to tome to \out par
lies. you (ouslanth update your speed dials with
people u ho know the most othei people. I hat way,
the social butterflies 011 your speed dial will invite
tons <>l people.

The goal of the Stanford
Gnutella server is to "try and
keep your social circle local," ac
cording to Rikleen.
"The main goal of this [Stan
ford] Gnutella server is to in
crease the chances that you will
get what you are looking for from
within the campus," he said.
There are two advantages to
keeping traffic on campus, ac
cording to Rikleen. First, it "re
duces the bandwith used be
tween Stanford and Genuity,
Stanford's Internet provider to
commodity Internet sites such as
CNN.com," he said. Second,
"downloads between campus
computers will probably go
much faster."
Decreasing the bandwith
usage on (tenuity is valuable he
cause there is a cap on how
much bandwith is available to
students. Currently, of the 100
megabits per second of band
with from Genuity serving the
entire campus, 40 are allotted to
residences.
"When we connect to Stan
ford computers, we have no cap
on internal bandwith," said ju
nior Jason Anderson, a residen
tial computing consultant in
Freshman / Sophomore College.
"We're just using our own infra
structure on campus when we
transfer information between
on-campus computers."
RCCs on campus were al
lowed to make public the exis
tence of the Stanford Gnutella

server on Nov. 9.
"We expect more students to
use it as word gradually-gets
around," said senior Dave
Cliisholm, a RCC in Mirrielees.
"Right now, people generally
find out by word of mouth and
a few RCCs have made an
nouncements to their dorm,
myself included."
Junior Derek Wong, RCC in
West Florence Moore Hall,
said, "I think students will use it
once they understand how
much faster this is than regular
downloads."
As word about this server is
reaching students on campus,
the response seems to be positive
thus far.
"lt d be much simpler for us to
be able to share our M P3 files, for
example, over a faster network,"
said freshman Lian Bloch. "Also,
I'd value faster Internet access,
which would allow for more effi
cient researching."
MP3s are just one type of file
students can share.
"What students choose to use
[the Stanford C.nutella server]
for — be it sharing music files or
resumes — is up to them, as long
as tlicit actions are legal and
within the University's rules and
regulations," Rikleen said.
Debt a Zumwalt, University gen
eral counsel, noted that all students
must agree to the .Acceptable Use
Policy Ix-fbre registering their In
ternet connections.
"Students and all other Stan
ford community users are re
quired to comply with our com
puter usage policy that prohibits
unauthorized copying of copy
righted materials," she said.
