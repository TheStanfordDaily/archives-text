### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
I lit- Stanford football team will spend its Christmas
in Seattle.
Released from the BCS and passed over by the I lol
idav and Sun Bowls, Stanford officially accepted an in
vitation yesterday to play in the inaugural Seattle
Bowl, to be held at SAFECO Field on Dec. 27.
I n the first football game to ever be played at SAFE
CO Field, the Cardinal will face an ACC opponent at 1
p.m. (PT) in a matchup that will be televised on ESPN.
Though a possible encounter with Florida State
could have been appealing, the Seminoles accepted a
bid to the Gator Bowl yesterday, leaving (ieorgia 1 ech
(Stanford's most likely opponent), North (Carolina and
(liemson as possible opponents for Stanford.
While Stanford fans may feel the Cardinal deserved
to be in a better bowl after completing one of the be st
seasons in school history — which included victories
over then No. 5 Oregon and UCLA — the Seattle
Bowl Committee is ecstatic to have what it considers a
steal in Stanford.
"We are highly excited and could not be happier to
have a team of this caliber in the Seattle Bowl," said Pete
Shinier, a member of the Seattle Bowl Committee.
The Cardinal, tanked No. 12 in l>otli the AP and
ESPN/USA Today polls and 10th in the BCS stand
ings, was more than what the Seattle Bowl committee

could have hoped for.it the beginning of the year,
when it was slated to take the fourth place team in tlie
Pacific 10 Conference.
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham, after
giving Washington alumnus Shinier a Stanford tool
ball cap and shirt, also expressed his enthusiasm for
the Seattle Bowl, which will officially name its sponsor
this week.
"1 think we're really excited and there are a litanv of
reasons to be excited," Willingham said. "One of the
accomplishments that our football team set out to
achieve this year was to play in a Bowl Game, and
we've clone that."
Though the Stanford plavers and coat lies have not
expressed their disappointment at not plavingon New
Year's Day. Stanford obviously cannot ignore the
irony of playing it-> bowl game in Washington.
flic two Washington schools are the only blemish
es on Stanford's record. II the (ardinal had beaten ei
ther Washington State.it Stanford or Washington in
Seattle, Stanford would likely be contending for the
national championship t Ins week.
Willingham subtly expressed the irony of this bit
tersweet season for the ( ardinal.
"1 think anytime you get to Seattle and eventually
get comfortable and start a winning pnxess in that
city, we'll be excited," said Willingham, in reference to
