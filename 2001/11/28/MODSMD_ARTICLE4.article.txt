### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lii .1 heated t.ilk w iili I ou Saksen, \'icv President
ol (ieneral Services .it the Medical ('enter, repre
sentatives from various student organizations tailed
to li.ili Medii al ('.enter subcontracting but vow ed to
continue their light against the practice.
Seven students and two hospital workers met
w itli Saksen vesierda\ afternoon in an attempt toei
tliei i hange hisdei ision on subcontraiting 10 Med
ii al ( filler positions or win a moratorium on it until
a t.isk lone ol students, fat ult\ and workers could
review the issue.
L.ed In junior Monica llenestro/a and sopho
more Amanda ( 'assel, students outlined their case.
"Subcontracted workers earn signilicantlv less."
( .issel said. "\\ e believe that all workers deserve to
earn .1 li\ ing wage."
( assel s.iul that subcontracted workers receive
no benefits, iuc hiding medii.il 1 are at the ('.enter.
In addition, such workers' poor training inhibits

their ability to sanitize the buildings.
"In a hospital, that's a serious eoncern," (lassel
said. "I personalh would not leelcomfortablegoing
into a hospital i leaned l>\ people w ho don't know
what they are doing."
Saksen said that il health standards dipped
below suitable levels, the ( entei would ( barge the
subcontractor lor the cost ot solving the problem.
Cassel said that subcontracting wasn't cost elli
cient — monev would have to be paid to middle
men and tor increased training due to high sub
contracted worker turnover rates. She said the
Medical ('.enter and I niversit\ have Insi mone\ in
the |>ast because of ibis.
Frank Arredondo and Jose Alave/ ol Medical
( '.enter Housekeeping Services discussed workers'
opinions on the matter.
"Subcontractors — the\ come in to work, thev
get tired, thev leave," Arredondo s.nd. I le s;ii< 1 reg
ular employees were a better, more reliable ( hoice
due to their experience and loyalty.
Alavez said that current workers
weren't just worried about the 10
positions slated to l>e sulx'ontracted.
"Rather, we're worried that in
the last three years, we've seen an
increasing encroachment by sub
contractors on positions," he said.
He also said subcontractors' slop
py work forced specialists to come
in and redo their tasks.
Saksen related the Medical
Center's need for cutbacks. Cur
rently, the Center is losing $3 mil
lion a month; Saksen estimated its
debt to be about $25 million.
"I don't think you accept the
fact that we're fighting for our sur
vival as an institution," he said.
Saksen declared that subcon
tracting workers would save
money; they receive nine to $12 an
hour and two weeks of vacation,

versus the $12 to $1(> an hour and
three-and-a-half weeks of vacation
granted to regular workers.
No medical benefits for sulxon
tracted workers were discussed.
Saksen estimated that $175,000
would be saved by subcontracting
the 10 jobs. Committee member
Lolita Roibal, a junior, estimated
the savings at $60,000.
"We did this in a way where no
one loses a job," Saksen said. In
deed, the 10 workers in question
will retain full benefits, moving
from positions in the Hoover
Pavilion, Psychiatry Center and
Blood Bank to vacant slots in the
Medical Center. Their jobs will be
filled by subcontracted personnel.
Saksen admitted that the re
placement of 10 open positions
with subcontracted ones wouldn't
solve the $25 million debt. 1 lowev
er, he noted, "The only way to turn
this institution around is to take lit
tle pieces out."
He said that while 1 percent of
the cutbacks were coming from the

maintenance workforce, 99 per
cent was coming from the rest of
the hospital.
"Everybody's got to con
tribute," he said.
" 1 hat's one percent; t lie work
ers will feel it 100 percent," I lene
stro/a countered.
"How much did they cut your
salary lor this, and how much has
the CEO's salary been cut?"
Roibal asked.
Saksen didn't comment on his
salary, but said that 22 Medical
Center Vice Presidential posts had
been cut to 12.
Saksen stressed that patient
care was the Medical Center's pri
mary mission, and that losses sus
tained for this service would have
to be absorbed via cutbacks.
"I can't agree to not contract out
workers ever," said Saksen, and he
held fast to this position despite
pleas and threats from the students
assembled. He held that nine to
$12 an hour was a living wage.
Students derided this claim,

stating that Ba\ Area costs of living
required workers at that wage to
take on multiple jobs to survive.
Committee and union representa
tives also feared this move was a
first step towards replacing work
ers with outsourced ones.
Saksen expressed .1 commit
ment to subcontracting out some
jobs and keeping in-patient
housekeeping in place.
"We could save a lot of money
by outsourcing all of housekeep
ing," he said. "I don't want to do
that. I'm trying to outsource
non-important buildings."
Students urged him to recon
sider his decision until a task force
could examine it. However, Sak
sen held firm, declaring he would
sign a contract with subcontractor
First Pacific as soon as possible.
Students present said they
were committed to the issue, de
spite this setback.
"We're willing to do more,"
Henestroza declared. "This is just
the start."
