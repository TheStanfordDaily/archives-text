"Go backpacking around California," sug

The Bechtel International Center will house four international students this
year during winter break who will organize house events and programs in

Mohnot, an international student
from India.
I oh suggested another feasible
but expensive possibilitv.
"Rent a room in a hotel or motel
in San Francisco," she said.
International students can also
resort to classifieds to explore
local subleasing opportunities.
Pearson offered a note of c aution
to students who may be consider
ing this option.
"All housing ads should be thor
oughly checked," he said. "Stu
dents should be sure that they fully
understand the conditions of the
rental agreement and should en
sure that they have privacy."

If international students staving
on campus are unable to find local
housing over the break, they
should immediately contact the
Bechtel International Center and
the I lousing ()ffic e. Pearson admit
ted that it is very rare for students to
be left homeless over the holidays.
"I am not aware of any under
graduates who were completelv
stranded during the past year,"
he said.
Some international students, in
cluding I oh, Mohnot and I x*e, said
they will fly home for the holidays.
Pearson stressed that those plan
ning to travel home should keep in
mind that they may encounter hur
dles in returning to the U.S. due* to
heightened security.
"If a student needs to obtain a
new visa from a U.S. Consulate,
there may be delays," Pearson said.
