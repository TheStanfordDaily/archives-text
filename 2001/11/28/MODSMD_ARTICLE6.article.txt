# Dead Week scrutinized as end of quarter nears
## 
### HOWARD CHIOU 
When asked to explain Dead
Week, many students seem to ding
to a single belief .
"It's a lit',' they sa\
In a way, they're right. 1 here is
nq official Dead Week, bill rather an
Knd-Quartei Period, which occurs
the week before final exams.
l be traditional Dead Week, ob
served mostly at schools on the se
mester system, sm h as I larvard and
Yale, usually involves a week-long
period of no (lasses, no assignments
and no papers. Stanford's own Knd-
Quarter policy, however, is vastU
different.
"Sometimes students think tb.it
nothing is supp<>sed to happen dur
ing that last week of classes, except
go to class," said t ni\ersit\ Registrar
Roger Printup. " lliafs not what the
policy says."
"If the professor bad announced
at the beginning of'class, '1 have a
schedule of quizzes or exams.' and
there is an exam that is not the final
exam during the last week of class,
then that's okay."
University policy, which is pub
lished in the lime St hedule, forbids
final examinations during the Knd-
Quailer Period, but permits classes,
quizzes and tests as long as they pre
viously announced.
Major papers or projects may
also Iw scheduled for Knd-Quarter,
as long as sti idents are given rcas< >11-
able notice.
"A few years ago. the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement ( banged the name of
the policy from Dead Week to Knd-

Quarter because of the confusion
over what 'dead means," Printup
said. "1 low dead is dead? I here is a
lot tli.it (.111 still gooll academically."
However, this fact doesn't seem
to Ixither some students.
"1 don't think it's that much dif
ferent than any normal week," said
sophomore Fred Ngo. " I here's
more room to stud) because you
don't have to turn in any work, and
most of the classes are pretty true to
the idea of not giving assignments
during Dead Week."
Senior Kdjah Nduom pointed
out the differences between the
tiizz\ and the techic Knd-Quarter
weeks. "With straight tabic ( lasses,
it generally is pretty much the same
as any other week." be said. "With
fuzzy ( lasses, there'll be a final paper
that I'll work on during Dead Week
and that ends up taking a lot of time,
so it ends up being a more stressful
academic period than others."
"I think most people can handle
it in a healthy way," said senior Sarah
Koehler.
" Hiosc people who can't hope
fully are doing something about it.
There are plenty of resources on
campus to help you learn bow to do
that," she continued.
Koehler pointed out the numlxT
of resources available to students, in
cluding professors, the Undergrad
uate.Advising Center, bead peer ad
vising coordinators, peer academic
advisors and academic advisors.
Philosophy John Perry, h<>w
ever, said lie was appalled that the stu
dents have not issued a formal com
plaint over the loss of I)ead Week.
"I think it's a terrible loss,"
Perry said. "1 was always surprised
by the good work and consolida
tion that used to be done during
Dead Week."
Printup countered, "You can't
[havea true Dead Week) in the quar
ter system, there's not enough time."
Physics Dept. Chair Doug Os
herofl agreed, saying, "I always feel

pressured for time. There are cer
tain ( lasses that try to cover a Ixxly oi
knowledge. For those, [the quarter
system] is hell."
Osheroff also pointed out that
students may approach Dead Week
in an inappropriate manner.
"Dead Week may make more
sense for other subjects, but for
physics, it really conveys the wrong
message to the students," he said.
"My concern is that if you have a full
week of Dead Week, you 're going to
get students who are going to put off
re;dly understanding the material
until Dead Week."
