### PAYAL DALAL 
Editor's Note: This story is the third in
stallment of The Daily's "Washingtoi
Wire" series, featuring contribution
from students studying and working n
our nation's capital at the Stanford n
Washington program. I lie students an
offering then unit/ue perspectives 01
the ei>ents unfolding in Washington
D.C.., and aeross the globe.

It was a morning in early No
vember, and I was antic ipating my
first East Coast (all. I had overslept
and was becoming increasingly
late for work.
The Metro was delayed, and
the only thing that overpowered
the sound of time passing was the
Metro loudspeaker, which ex
plained that all trash receptacles
had been removed as a security
precaution. A fabulous start to a
Wednesday morning.
From the outset, I knew this
quarter in Washington, D.C..,
would be different from most
Stanford in Washington terms.
We would be subject to more secu
rity, scrutiny and suspicion.
My intuitions were right. Peo
ple here were more on edge; every
siren brought 011 a faster heartbeat
and a mad clash to CNN.com.
Sometimes, it seemed as if the*
whole c ity was holding its breath,
waiting for the newest discovery of
anthrax, the newest uncovered
terrorist plot.
As I arrived at the corner of
18th and 11, my negative thoughts
were interrupted by the sounds of
a homeless trumpeter. A brown

canvasbac kp.ic k. .111 Americ ,111 flag
and a brass trumpet were all he
had to his name, vet every morn
ing lie cntei t,lined me with count
less trumpet solos.
In the weeks after Sept. 1 1, he
played solemn, reverent, patriotic
pieces. I le did not ask for money;
lie simply played. I lis mournful
songs would pierce the air for
blocks, and the commuters lis
tened quieth and respectfully.
And then, one day, a month
after the terrorist attacks, he
changed gears. Ile had decided
that it was time to heal. Armed
with his American flag, he yelled to
us that he was back at full strength
and expected the same from us.
I lien, with determination gleam
ing in his eyes, he played the na
tional anthem.
It was then that 1 finally ac
knowledged it: I loved being in
D.C. Yes, at times I was fright
ened, but more often than not, 1
was inspired — In the increase
of camaraderie in the city, by
the American Hags hanging
from every house and office
building, In the spirit of the city
and the people, In the sounds of
.1 trumpet.
I needed to be in D.C. because I


ALEXIA NIhISEN/The Stanford Daily
wanted to be exposed to every
thing that was happening. 1 did
not want to live in a bubble; I want
ed my part in history.
1 lie increase in policemen
does not make me nervous any
more; in fact, it has become con
venient, because I always have
someone to ask for directions
when I'm lost. The lack of trash
cans decreases the smell in the

Metro, and my constant attention
to CNN has made me more aware
of the world then ever.
While I do look forward to re
turning to Stanford in the winter,
I will miss D.C. Ill miss being able
to go to museums during my
lunch break, meeting people from
all over the world and pretending
to be a grown-up.
I am also going to miss my
friend at the corner of 18th and H,
who constantly reminded me of
the resiliency of the human spirit
and the power of the music of a
brass instrument.
