## The 						Stanford Daily Gnutella server convenient but ethically dubious 
### 
Published Since IS')I

Scvci.il weeks ago, Residential Com
puting set up a (.nutella server
(gnutella.stanford.edu) in order to
allow faster and more reliable down
loads on tlie popular tile-sharing service for
on-campus residents. Although ethically
questionable, the new service benefits stu
dents and partialis alle\iates the I niversity's
bandwidth problem.
(•uutella was intended to be the titanic of
modern piracy software, an indestructible
torce that would do everything Napster did,
except in a powerfully unstoppable way. but
because ol bandwidth resiri< tions and «i gener
al loss ol interest, the system became unusable,
few tiles were available, and many download
attempts ended only in error.
Setting up a (inutclla server within the Stan
lord network not only makes downloads arrive

taster and more reliably, but also relieves stress
on the University's Internet connection. I lie
University-imposed cap on residenti.il band
width slows I nternct use lor everybodv, and to
the extent that otf-campus traflic can be re
duced, the taster all connections will be. Pre
sumably the new server will mean that more
students will download from othei students,
saving precious Internet-bound bandwidth tor
other uses.
In that sense, Residential Computing has
demonstrated a remarkable sensitivity to stu
dent need and has responded in a wav that will
be beneficial to everyone. Rescomp should ex
amine other ways to work around the clraconi
an bandwidth limitation and improve residen
tial Internet access.
t he debate over the ethic s of tile sharing,
however, isn't so simple. Napster was shut

down tor running servers over which users
could pirate music, despite the fact that the
company had no active role in creating the il
legal c opies. (iiiutella cllectivclv does the same
thing as Napster, but it's supposedly impossible
to terminate because there's no central server
to shut down, and, as the argument goes, "it
would be impossible to shut down everybody."
()t course it might be impossible to shut
clown every user, but it doesn't seem like it
would be impossible to shut down the servers
at a major research university. Stantord is not
the same as some mvsterious user lurking on
the Internet, and a university-sponsored file
sharing server is likely to attract attention. In
lac t, it's kind ot sin pi ising to see the Universi
t\ engaging in rather dubious online activity.
Perhaps, from a legal perspective, running a
(iiiutella server is a different case. Hither way,

it certainly seems as if Stanford is doing the
same thing Napster was that caused the now
infamous lawsuit.
Statements from Rescomp and General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt seem to reflect the po
sition that Stanford is providing a neutral serv
er and that what students do on it is their busi
ness. Zumwalt even points out that copyright
piracy is against the Acceptable Use Policy, as if
this were a guarantee that students will not vi
olate copyright laws.
I his kind of friendly naivete seems to send
the message: "We know Stanford students are
going to break copyright laws, and as long as
they're going to do it anyway, we might as well
provide a convenient environment in which
they'll get fast downloads and use less band
width." lhe file-sharing service is great, but
the ethical message is dubious at best.
