As you read this (assuming you do so

one sunrise and one sunset, even 00
minutes.
Despite the fact that I live on a ram pus
where .it least lull the people are just
bursting with scientific and teehnieal
knowledge. I'm willing to bet that the ina
jorit\ ol vou didn't know that the earth's
population will be short 10 people lor the
next couple weeks, and ili.it we've been
minus three people for over a vcar now.
Last October saw the 100 th space
shuttle mission take to the skies. Now,
inereK a yc.u later, S I S-1 ON will deliver
the International Space Station's fourth
full-time t tew.
In the past L'O wars, the shuttle svstem
has launched three million pounds ol
< argo and ( art ied nearlv (>()() passengers
and pilots, live different ot biters have
amassed almost three cumulative vears
of flight time and traveled more than 3 15
million miles.
I he shuttle has supported two space
stations and made three maintenance
flights to the I lubble Space Telescope. It
has launched planetary missions to
study Jupiter, Venus and the sun, and it
has conducted hundreds of studies of
the effects of weightlessness on materi
als, plants, animals and humans. All
that, and the vehicle is onl\ a quarter of
the wax through its design lifetime.
I here are years to go before the moth
balls begin to call.
Do vou know what the c urrent crew is
actually working on up there? I hough
the videos may lead vou to believe it's all
fun and games, traveling in space has
never exactly been a cushy job assign
ment. lake one look at each new mem
ber's schedule, and you'll see every sec -
ond of every day planned to the letter,
with scientists and engineers squeezing
everything they possibly can out of the
opportunity to experiment in a foreign
environment.

Sure, those astronauts may have .1
minute 01 two ovei the course of a week
to catch floating M&Ms in theii nit nit lis,
hut believe me, they're working iheii lin
gers 10 the hone.
Altei a slow start, on-orhil construc
tion of the International Spate Station
lias finalh pit ketl up the pat e. 1 he past
veai lias seen the addition of enormous
solai panels, a large s< ientific lahorator\
module, a robotic ai in antl a state-of-the
art airlot k.
Ilie mission that begins toda\ will
1 arr\ — along with .1 new three-member
crew —a logistics module that serves as
a sort of outer-space moving van, carry
ing new supplies tt> keep the station
humming. If vou hlink for too long, you
might miss the start of something entire
l\ new at the station.
I here is now an international t rew in
the spat e station at all times. 1 he exper
iments the\ conduct will teach us more
about the so-called \oi<l (which isn't re
all) a void at all) outside 0111 planetary
bubble and about the environment we
inhabit hereon (he ground. It won't he
just the six or seven people living above,
either, fhere will he flight controllers
on the ground working round-the-i lock
and at ross the globe, aiding astronauts
and cosmonauts in orbit antl analyzing
the huge amounts of data 1 hey w ill begin
to amass.
So w hat tloes the larger picture entail?
I he space shuttle has enabled our coun
tr\ (and others) to make unprecedented
discoveries about our planet, our uni
verse antl ourselves. Without a space pro
grain. we might not have many of the
tilings we reh tin each tlay: cell phones,
satellite television feeds, early warning
weather radar antl various phainiaccuti
(als.
Many of you are sitting in California
today because 500 years ago, some guy
named ('.olumhus thought there might
be land over here. Sure, there were plen
ty of people who said it couldn't he done,
or that even if it could, why bother?
Maybe some even argued that the
mone\ should be spent fixing Spain's
other problems, like maybe homeless
ness or Social Security.
I be point is that he tlitl it anyway.
And he was right, and it worked. St) why
do we today seem doomed to make the
same mistakes that Columbus' naysayers
tlitl all those years ago? fhe wild and
crazy idea that mankind could have a
permanent outpost on the final frontier
is quickly proving itself a reality, and the
world isn't even paying attention. Wake
up —this is where our future lies!
My challenge to you is simple: be in
formed. Make it your job to find out
what's going on in spat e. I here's lit) ex
cuse for anyone at a distinguished school


Sarah Graybeal
such as Stanford not to know what's hap
pening at the forefront of lei Imology. II
nothing else, be inspired! Space is cool!
So open the paper and find out what
happened in orbit yesterdav. Surf
NASA's multitude of Web sites and find
out what kinds of things a fraction ola
cent of your taxpaver dollar is funding.
1 urn on vour I V tonight and wait li the
shuttle carry seven people not so differ
ent from yourselves into orbit. And
when they come home, thank them for.»
job well done.

One long time from now in a galaxy not un
like this one, Sarah hopes to be on hoard tin
shuttle when the engines light. In the mean
tune, she wishes she got more e-mail, which
can be sent to gra\beal(<i slanlord.edu.
