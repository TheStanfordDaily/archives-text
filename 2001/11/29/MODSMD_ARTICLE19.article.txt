SHPRC article was "informative"
I want to thank Alia Gonopolsky for
the groat stoi \ I lie Dailv printed regard
ing the Sexual Health Peer Resource
(lonter. For those who missed the article,
among othei items, it discussed the ten
ter's distribution of "flavored, heating
massage oil samples." My first reaction
was, "Yes, please." But, what is even
more entu ing than the oil itsell is the ra
tionale for the handing out of'the oil sam
ples. As ('.enter Co-Director Sam
Richardson explained, "We want to pro
vide students with wavs to he sensual and
intimate without having intercourse."
Let me tr\ to understand this. I hey're
trying to limit the incidence of sexual in
tercourse I>v handing out massage oil.
I hat's like lighting obesitv In handing
out free banana splits. Here's what 1 want
to know: Do the anti-intercourse massage
oil samples also come with a pitcher ol
margaritas and Barry White's latest CD?
Now, please don't let my shock and
amazement be interpreted as disap
proval. On the contrary. I his is tlit* best
news I've read in ages. Incredibly, howev
er, not everyone welcomes this massage
oil entitlement with open palms and but
tocks. For example, sophomore Geoff
Morris asked, "Wouldn't our money be
better spent on useful items, like cold
medicine?" With all due respect, Mr.
Morris, how long has it been since you last
had ... a cold?
Believe me, suffering through a cold is
not that bad when compared with the op
portunity to lubricate your sex life with free
massage oil. In fact, rather ironically, the
only time I seem to ever get a cold is be
cause I'm spending time standing outside
some (lul) until the wee hours of the morn
ing, trying to convince some prospective
partner that she really needs a massage â€”

free scented oil just might help to close
some of those deals, completely obviating
the need for any Lchinacca or, yes, even
112 ree told medicine from Cowell.
I he article ottered other lessons, as well,
l or example, did you know that every stu
dent is entitled to 12 free condoms each
(juarter? I hat's a ver\ nice gesture, but ev
eryone knows that the frequency of sexual
intercourse follows the well-established
principle known as the "when it rains it
pours" phenomenon. I hat is, no one ever
lias sex 12 times in a semester. Lither you
have sex once ever)' 12 semesters, or you
have sex 12 times a dav. I guess the idea is
that .it the start of each semester, we should
all go into the Center and collect our 12
condoms, either for use later that day or to
add to our stockpile.
Here's a word to the wise on the
stockpiling, however. I hose condoms
typically have an expiration date. I
should know. I lie start of the new mil
lennium was meaningful for me not only
because of the instant devaluation of
Prince's seminal party song "1999," but
also because it marked the expiration
date for so many stored boxes of con
doms, left over from the unfulfilled
promise of spring breaks past.
I wonder what tlie motivation for the
distribution of the free condoms is. It's
hard to believe that it's strictly financial.
After all. once you've incurred the sunk
cost of a couple of breakfast burritos at
the Iree I louse and a pitcher of cider at
the CoHo, surely the additional 50 cents
needed for the condom will not be the
deal breaker.
Perhaps the free condoms are given
out to avoid the embarrassment of having
to go to a store to purchase them. I've
never understood why there's such
sheepishness associated with buying con
doms. Condom shoppers should run to

the drugstore with the same excitement
and enthusiasm that Sylvester Stallone
exhibited when triumphantly climbing
those stairs in Rocky.
1 lie article suggests that the nickname
for the center where one finds these com
plimentary products is "the Sex Base
ment." I agree with my friend Chloe who
reacted to this story by saying, "Maybe
Stanford's not that lame after all." Maybe
not, ( hloe. Maybe not.

Stanford's trail routes are inadequate
Director of Government and Commu
nity Relations Larry Norton's assertion
that its trail alignments at e "environmen
tally superior" to the community's pro
posed routes is beyond rationalization.
Stanford s S-l trail route would require a
bridge to be built over Matadero Creek in
a special conservation area for red-legged
Irogs. It will unquestionably have an im
pact on their riparian habitat.
I he community's S-l trail does not in
titule on red-legged frog habitat and is
routed along the existing dish trail and on
an existing service road. No new con
struction. no environmental impact. The
only special conservation area anywhere
in the vicinity of community trail C-1 is on
the banks of San Francisquito Creek,
which the community proposed trail stays
well away from.
Misleading information in an Oct. 16th
letter by Stanford spokesman Robert
Reidy stated that a tentative agreement for
trail easements with Menlo Park had been
reached, which is not the case. Stanford's
