It \v,is the worst of times before it \n.is the best of
times last night at Maples Pavilion for the Stanford
women's basketball team.
Although the No. 7 Cardinal defeated the I ni
versitN of San Francisco 103-72 last night, extend
ing its winning streak to six games, the team had to
overcome .1 less-than-memorable first half to do so.

Yesterday: No. 7 Stanford 102, San Francisco
73

I Sl' (0-!t) opened the half will) a scrappy, ag
gressive defense that seemed more apt lor a loot
hall game. The l.adv Dons' defense swarmed the
Cardinal offense, causing 14 turnovers in the first
half alone. 1 he intense plav hy I SF also cffectivel\
shut down the Stanford outside game, as only se
niors I.indsey Yamasaki and Lauren St. ('.lair saw

Dons matched Stanford tit-lot-tat for nearh 15
minutes, as the i rowel at Maples watc lied the lead

1 he ( animal continued to pound the kill inside
looking for points, eventuallv finding them in
sophomore Nicole Powell and senior Betliam
Donaphin.
Powell had eight points in the half, hut it was
Donaphin who stole the show after coining oil the
bench. Donaphin put in 12 of her eventual 22
points in this lirst hall to keep the C ardinal in the
game, including a c ritical lay-up with 0:2 I left to
play that would give Stanford the lead lor good.
"I wanted to give more to my team," said
Donaphin. "I wanted to he energetic.
Sheer grit pushed Stanford into the second hall
with a IS-38 lead, but the team that emerged from
the locker room had a decidedly different look to it.
"1 want to sav we played two different games
tonight." s.iid head coach 1 ara VanDerveei.
1 he numbers certainly seemed to suggest so.
After Donaphin's big half, the C ardinal opened
with a new offensive look. 1 he team elec ted to spread
lour players on the perimeter, leaving Donaphin
alone to handle the lane. I he move spread the San
Franc isco defense and Stanford got rolling.
Donaphin opened the half by converting a three
point play off an offensive board to set the tone for
the rest of the game. She would finish with 10 re
bounds and six blocks, demonstrating her domi
nance on both ends of the court.
"Bethany really came out to play, said Yan-
Dcrveer.
In fact, Donaphin spent more time than anyone
else on the floor last night (3 I minutes), coining oil
only when the outcome was certain.
I lie second half saw contributions from all sides.
Powell and Yamasaki stepped up their play, creat
ing shots for their teammates and putting in their
own, finishing with 14 and 10 points respectively.
By spreading the defense, the C lardinal was also
able to find its outside game again, thanks in large
part to freshman Kelley Suniinski.
"Kellev's been realh steady," said VanDerveei .
"She's extremely poised."
Suniinski went an impressive five for six behind
the 3-poitit arc to end with a game-high points.
"People were setting me up with open shots,"
said Suniinski. "1 was feeding olf energy the team
w as creating."
