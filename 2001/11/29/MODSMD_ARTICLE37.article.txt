# 'Teatro' a feast for eyes and mouth
## 
### RANDY MANO 
An experience replete with feasts for the
eyes and stomach, dinner theater show
Teatro /in/.anni" is an entertainment en
thusiast's heaven. In fact, the roughly four
hours I spent inside the Belgian spiegeltent
— a hand-hewn Furopean pavilion —
were so dazzling that I left the place with
my head spinning, dizzy from .ill the
trapeze, juggling. comed\ and food that

atmosphere, a mix of Cirque d'Soleil and

When ii comes to the food of a specialty
event, I usualh become skeptical. Dinner
theater shows emphasize the theater ele

ment without paying much attention to the
rubber chicken or measly portions that
they're dishing out. With that said, the
lamb medallions by Le Chef (Frank Fer

rante) are tjnite excellent, while the dessert
— almost unenjoyable because of how full I
was by that point — is a perfect end to the
five-course meal. Don't worry about leaving
hungry or unsatisfied in this department.
All performers deserve special recogni
tion for their incredible contributions to the
show. Maria Muldaur, a Grammy-nominat
ed veteran artist, dazzles the audience with
her jazzy blues singing as the Chanteuse,
while Kristin Clayton adds operatic balance
as the Diva, who even competes with the
Chanteuse at one point of the show. Joe
Orrach's tap-dancing shoes wowed the
crowd into submission, and Patrick
Leonard. Sergex Krutikov and Luc Martin
rounded out the bill with their respective
talents of Jekyll-and-Hvde acting, juggling
and trapeze.
1 previously had seen thecomedic duo of
Sol/irk I lebert and Johnnv Filion at ( '.it que
du Soleil's "Dralion," and they utilized
some of the same verbal and visual gags to
get the audience going. Overall, though,
the entire "Teatto" — nimbly hosted In
Madame ZinZanni (Doloreze Leonard) —
is <t combination of its parts, all adding up to
mayhem in a clever, calculated manner that
will always be unique because of the impro
visation and the audience. Go see it to c ele
brate a special occasion before it moves on
to a new site.
