# Game Cube beats X-box for X-mas
## 
### JUNG LAH DOUGLAS WILSON 
Since 1985, the
word "Nintendo" has
been synonymous
with video games
played at home. The
release of the 8-bit
Nintendo Entertain
ment System (M S)
proved that not only
were home console
systems what many
people wanted in
their living rooms,
but also that the video

game industry itself was hugely profitable.
In the subsequent years since the NHS,
there have been console wars galore, with
gaming companies each trying to win their
share of the market. Super Nintendo, Sega
Genesis, or NEC's Turbo Grafx-16? Sony
Play Station, Nintendo 04 or Sega Dreamcast?
With the videogame industry larger than ever
— reaching sales of $8.1 billion this year alone
(eclipsing movie box office sales) — video
games and consoles have become mainstream
entertainment.
During the upcoming holiday season,
consumers must decide between Sony's
Play Station 2 (PS2), Microsoft's X-Box and
Nintendo's GaineCube, which was released
on Nov. IS.
IstheGame( lube letter than the PS'iorthe
X-Box? Nintendo's competitors do have cer
tain advantages over the GameGube. For ex
ample. both the PS2 and X-Box j>la\ DVDs
and (IDs, and are embracing online gaming as
the wave of the future. I lowever. both systems
also cost $300, which — at $100 more than the
(.ameClube — means vou're paving more for
the extra non-gaming features.
I'he PS'J's major selling point is its back
wards compatibility with the original Planta

hundreds of games. It is also currently the
onl\ one to feature the insanek popular Final
Fant«is\ games put out In game-developer

PS2 has been giving developers pr< >hlcms dur
ing programming, a familiar issue that
plagued the NO I.
X-Box, which sports the most powerful
raw hardware specs of the three svstems. is
clearK Bill Gates'attempt tol)iill\ his was into
the profitable video game industn. Its bulk\
controller and lack of huilt-in lan base like
Sony or Nintendo have left the X-Box as a
<jiiestion mark in the battle between consoles.
But asalwavs, in the end, it all comes down to
the games.
I'he knock against Nintendo has always
been that it caters to the "kid" audience more
than older gamers, a claim somewhat sub
stantiated when considering its Pokemon ti
tles and its tendency to shy away from games
rated "M" lor mature (i.e., games with vio
lence, cuss words and sex). But Nintendo has
also attracted more third-party support from
game developers, most notably Capcom's M
rated "Resident Evil" series, l'hose games,
along with other, more "adult" titles such as a
"Perfect Dark" sequel, indicate Nintendo's
willingness to stray away from its family-ori
ented image, even if only to a small degree.
There are over 10 games available for the sys
tem's launch. I fere is an in-depth hx>k at four
of them.

[Star Wars
Rogue I -eaden ,
Rogue Squadron 11
Lucas Arts

I ft here is one must-own title lor the launch
ol tlu- (iaiuK"ube, then "Rogue I.eadt t" is it.
()ut of even single game for everv game os
tein that tried to incorporate a Star Wars
theme. "Rogue 1 .eader," I.ucasArts s sequel to
1998's "Rogue Squadron" for the N(>L blows
everything else out of the water. I he graphics
truly demonstrate the power of the Came
(lube, while the gameplay is intuitive enough
lor the novice and challenging enough for the
veteran. Even thing about "Rogue Leader"
feels authentically ripped out of (Jeorge
Lucas's films, from the dialogue samples to
level missions that directly correspond to their
on-screen movie narratives. This authentic ity
of experience, coupled with outstanding
gameplay, is what makes "Rogue Leader" a
truly superior game.
Hie first level immediately plunges you
into the Death Star attack, run from"A New
I lope," complete with hundreds of turbo laser
turrets gunning for your ass in the trench,
while ()bi-\Van's spirit voice tells you to use the
force and not your targeting computer. Play
ers fly in X-Wings, Y-Wings, A-Wings. B-
Wings and Snow Speeders as either 1 ukeSkv
walker or Wedge Antilles, through eleven mis
sions that are either directly out of the oiiginal
Star Wars Trilogy or indirectly related to the
films' events. There's nothing quite like down
ing an Imperial walker on Hoth using only
your tow-cables and your inherent Force
prowess. And (he words " There's too many of
them!" take on greater significance after reliv
ing the Rebel Fleet's attack on the second
Death Star, where multiple Star Destroyers
and seemingly infinite squadrons of I IK in
terceptors lltxxl your radar and your televi
sion screen a la "Return of the Jetli."
But tilings don't stop with just level com
pletion. There are genuinely challenging
level goals that enable you to earn various
medals upon completion, just like in the orig
inal " Rogue Squat Inn and its pseudo-sequel,
"Battle for Naboo." This time, however,
medals earn you points, which you can then
use to unlex k set ret missions such .is the Mille
nium falcon's escape into the asteroid field
from " The Empire Strikes Back." Points tan
also unlock secret craft, ranging fiom the
Naboo Stat fighter to Darth's \ ader's ti u ked

Also, theenenn Al is nun h better than in
previous games. I IT. squadrons will tl\ off
in different directions as you pursue them,
and Imperial fighters will lock onto von and

vour fellow Rogues will follow vour com
mands to form up on your wing or take out
specific targets.
If you have the speaker system to handle it.
then you can enjoy "Rogue Leader" in glori
ous Dolbv Surround Sound Pro Logic 11. And
the game's graphics outdo PS'J's "Starfighter"
easily, with scenes that reach almost cinematic
quality. If for some reason you hate Star Wars,
then maybe it's possible for you not it) like
"Rogue Leader." But this game is definitely
not just for Star Wars fans, ft is an amazing
spectacle to behold in every category —
graphics, sound, gameplay and fun — and it is
tlie reason gamers will buy a (iame( lube in the

coming months. If vou like video games even
a little bit, then you owe it to yourself to earn
enough medals to become Supreme Allied
Commander after personally leading the
Rebel Alliance in blowing up the reconstruct
ed Death Star with the Millennium Falcon.
Plav this game immediately.

Luigi's Mansion ,
Nintendo

lfvou go into this game expecting the next
Mario platformer, you might be disappointed.
Whit h is not tosa\ that "Luigi's Mansion" isn't
a fun game, because it is. It just isn't the launch
title mam were expecting from Nintendo's
flagship characters. "Luigi's Mansion" does,
however, showcase the Came Cube's impres
sive lighting eflet is and layering graphical ( a
pabilities while incorporating all facets of its
multi-buttoned controller into a puzzle-solv
ing game that is fun now, but mavbe not as fun
a month from now.
Luigi has "won" a mansion in a contest he
never entered, and now his brother Mario is
trapped inside. Of course, the mansion just
happens to be infested with hundreds of
ghosts, meaning Luigi has to suck up those
bastards "(ihostbusters'-style, room by rtxrni,
until he finds and rescues Mario. Along the
way. Luigi is aitletl by a professor, who pro
vides him with a vacuum cleaner and Hash

not van much from start till finish. That said,
ghost busting is a solidh entertaining experi

the game progresses. The game remains fresh
by constantly challenging the player with new
puzzles to solve in the rooms, ranging from

there are no extensive side-quests or mini
games to get w rapped up in.and the huge
castle environment from "Mario ti-f' |iisi isn't
matched by the beautifully rendered but siill
kind-of-small haunted mansion. This isn't
the revolutionary launch title t hat players will
look back on fondly years from now in the
same way they do "Super Mario World" on
the Super Nintendo and "Mario l> I" on the
N64. The fact remains that most players will
probably finish "Tuigi's Mansion" in a few
days. However, that doesn't mean it's not
worth playing.. . and it will certainly title
vou over until "Mario Sunshine" conies out.

I Super Monkey Ball ,
I Amusement
L. ★★★★★

()ver the past lew (lavs, I've curiously f< hjihl
myself daydreaming about monkevs trapped
iu transparent balls. frantically rolling around
on moving platforms floating thousands ol
feet above the ground. No, I haven't been
dropping arid; I'm just hopelessly hooked on
Supei Monke\ Ball. Sega's wackv debut to the
world of Nintendo.
t hough its premise screams absurdity.
Super Monke\ Ballisridiculouslvlun— both
for one and multiple players. In the main
game mode, players must, in full 3-D, tilt pit
fall-laden platforms in order to roll their 111011-
kevs to the finish line belore time runs out.
Players are awarded points not onlv depend
ing on how quickly they can finish the level,
but also based on the number of bananas they
can grab along the way. Gloriously, this time
vs. banana conflict provides for some intense
gaining, especially when multiple people plav
simultaneously iu "Competition Mode." Fven
for solo gamers. Super Monkey Ball compris
es quite a challenge, .is the latter half of the
game's over W levels are tnind-liendingly dif
licult. And as if the main game mode was
somehow insufficient. Super Monkey Ball is
packed with six additional, addictive mini
games: Monkey Fight (my personal favorite),
Monkey Target. Monkey Race, Monkey Bil
liards, Monkey Bowling and Monkey Golf.
In terms of gaineplay mechanics. Super
Monkey Ball is as good as it gets. The game
boasts simple controls, fantastic, unobtrusive
camera work and fluid, realistic in-game
physics. 111 respect to graphics and sound.
Super Monkey Ball certainly holds its own,
though occasional!) sutlers from moments of
averageness. I lie graphics are clean and ap
propriately cartoonv. but lail to take advan
tage of the Gamecube's full power. Further
more, the sound effects, though cute and in
conspicuous, can become repetitive. The
music too is repetitious, but, on the positive
side, complements the mini-game and level
moods
Simply put, I love Supei Monkey Ball.
Given the indicate, challenging one-plavei
mode and the potential loi acUlit tive, heated
tnultiplaver action, what isn't there to love?

[Wave Racer: .i-
Blue Storm

Wave Racei: Blur Storm is <i great game —
il vou (.in get into it. I nlbrtunatcly. in this
case, that's a significant if.
Blue Storm, the much-anticipated sequel
to Waveracer (VI. is .i jet ski racing game ven
siniilai to its predecessor. In Blue Storm's var
ioiis tacing motles, players not only try to
make it to the finish line first, hut must also
navigate between buoys a la slalom. In addi
tion. Blue Storm contains a "Stunt Mtxle" in
which players store points by performing
trie ks such as Mips and barrel rolls.
112 irst and foremost, it must be noted that,
for newcomers to the series, Blue Storm is a
very difficult game. Because the jet ski is slight
ly delayed in its response to player input and
because the turning controls are somewhat
sensitive, it takes a long time to develop control
over the jet ski. As a result, Blue Storm is inac
cessible and can be overly frustrating for new
players, making it a meditxre party game.
Nevertheless, for the avid gamer willing to put
