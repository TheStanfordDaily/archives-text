# It could use 'Focus'

### RANDY MANO 
I guess even the best actors
can have their shortcomings.
William 11. Macy, the even man

in modern-era
classics such as
"Fargo" and
"IMeasantville,"
can't he faulted
for signing on to
an adaptation of
Arthur Miller's
co 11 troversial

play, "Focus." However, it is
clear from the get-go that Macv
cannot carry this stilted and
one-dimensional drama very far
on his broad acting shoulders.
Macy, as Lawrence Newman,
has to evoke a careful balance

between his own value structure
and the social mores floating
around him. Essentially, the
Larry of this WW'l I-era drama is
the same as the countless out

siders in
today's soci
ety, ranging
from those
of Middle
Eastern de
scent to anti
war protest
ers. Larry

holds certain inalienable rights
— the right to live and own a
home, the right to have a job,
the right to be tolerant — dear
to his heart, but the crush of
anti-Semitism and the increas
ing skepticism of his neighbors

during the War makes life ver\
difficult for the decent man.
It is indeed true that even in
a grand place like the United
States, people are just plain ig
norant or racist. But to hammei
home this point incessantly in
"Focus" seems to be missing the
complexity of the matter. What
"Focus" unveils in its running
time could have been boiled
down to a portion of a lecture,
with room to spare.
As Larry's love interest,
Gertrude Hart (Laura Dern)
has a more mysterious past, but
deals with the same problem
that Larry contends with
throughout the film. That issue

Including Meat Loal as Larry's

Yes, even Macy can make mis
takes. After all. he is the one who
sold out to the high-value (but low
expectation) productions of " Juras
sic Park 111" and cameos on "KR.


Honey, stop staring at it. It's not getting any bigger.
