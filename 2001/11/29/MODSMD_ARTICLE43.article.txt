# Tenacious D: truly a piece of craft
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
What happens when yon take two talent
ed musicians, who happen to he funm as
hell, throw in a couple acoustic guitars, spice
in some blistering lyrics and top it off with
<111 abundance of stage presence? You get
Tenacious 1). Pretty simple. The controver
sy lies in the following question: are Tena
cious 1) musicians who are funny, or just co
medians who sing?
I his is a touchy subject, because classify
ing them as the latter is a surefire way to
cheapen and dismiss their musical skills.
They do have the odds stacked against
them.
1. Both guys —Jack Black on lead vocals
and guitar, and kvle (iass on lead guitar
and vocals —are actors. (You might
have recently seen |at k Black as the title
character in "Shallow Hal," or in his
scene-stealing role in"I ligh Fidelity.")
2. Tenacious I) got started in a comedy
club in L.A.
3. They had a show on HBO a couple of
years ago.
But damn, listen to their album. While
the lyrics are hilarious, the musicianship is
also top notch. The backing talent, which in
cludes DaveGrohl, Page from Phish and the
Dust Brothers as producers, is top notch.
Put bluntly, this is an album of great
acoustic heavy metal that happens to be
funny as well, and the humor is. .. top

notch. And when Jack Black was asked the
comedian / musician question recently, he
answered: "I.ook: our record is in the rock
section, isn't it? Enough said."
1 have to agree: Tenacious I) is good rock
and roll. l.ast week, 1 had the pleasure of
catching Tenacious I) live in concert .it the
Event ('.enter in San Jose. Jimmy Eat World
opened for them, and they themselves were
supporting a little band called Weezer—
perhaps you've heard of them? Well cousin,
that concert on the whole was kickin', and
here's why.
First of all, Weezer was headlining, and
they were great. I hey had the joint jump
ing, and the entire arena singing along with
many of their hits. But here's w here things
get interesting. Tenacious 1) had the entire

joint lump
ing too —
the crowd
sang along
loud and
clear with
hits such as
" Wonder
bov, Trib
ute" .ind the
classic piece
of sensitivity
"Fuck Her
Gent 1 y . "
While sup
porting acts
are often
just a rock

111 the way of tlu' head liner, it
was cleat that <i large portion ol
the audience was there tor these
two everyman aconstii guitarist
heroes.
Ihe\ performed in their clas
sic style as just a duo, i.e. no
backup hand such as on the (ID,
with stellar stage presence.
(Maybe their acting skills reall\
help.) And minus th.it one j.u k
ass in the front row who appar
ently shouted "you suck,
where's Wee/er" and was then
subjected to some si//ling em
barrassment from |ack Black
while everyone laughed and
( heered, the crowd loved them.
Oh. and did I mention Wee/et
was great too?
Yeah, it was a good show (for
.ill ya suckers that didn't go).
So. what is the key to Tena
cious D's artistic — and now
growing commercial — suc
cess? Is it. as they put it. tongue
firmly in cheek: "this wild lead
singer with pipes of platinum?"
Or, is it"the heavy set bald fel
low churning out riffs of pure
profundity?" Well damn, it's
both guys. But I'm sure you al-

ready knew th.it. The chemistry between
these two crazy guys is enough create a
truly remarkable piece of craft (not crap)
when combined with their tight and timed

musical skills. Both live and on CI), these
two acoustic metalheads rock. They are
also very funny. And that is all we need to
know. Now we enjoy.
