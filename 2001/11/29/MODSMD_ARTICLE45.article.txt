With two of the finest actors in the industry. a
fresh plate ol special ellects, and a seemingly in
teresting storyline, it seems this movie can't go
wrong. Where it wanders astray is in the same
place so nianv recent films have — an image por
tioned in the trailer that doesn't hold true. Sold as
an action Ilick, I asked myself where all the action
1 saw in the movie preview was. 100 many of the
scenes in the middle seemed irrelevant to the rest
ol the picture and aside from being saturated with
interesting camera tricks, tJiev were lackluster in
the interest factor. "Spy (lame" was missing those
edge-of-your-seat moments that made "Die

flick, but instead I bought myself a nap!
