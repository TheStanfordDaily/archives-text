Devito plavs .1 loud-mouthed crime boss, his
voice contains its usual screeching but Devito
conies up with enough punch lines to be more
enjoyable than annoving. Pidgeon (who .ilso
starred in M.imet s 20(H) liliu. "State and Main")
pl.i\s the most fascinating character, an ultra

Many of the tricks are
beautiful, hut in his re
lentless drive to keep us
from saying, "Okay,
that's what's going 011."
Maine! resorts to less in
teresting moves like
wounded gins rising un
expectedly from off
screen.
As is necessary in any
crime story, Maniet i 11-

sells just enough pathos and depth into his characters to
make you care and pull for them, despite their law
breaking tendencies. 1 lie intensity of character conies
from the life and death situations, situations replete with
guns, bombs and knives. But it's the- same reason war
movies and war stories are so compelling: only there do
we face instantaneous death, do we put our lives at im
mediate risk fora certain goal. I his world of criminals
enables c harac ters to face that death, only a little closer
to home.
"Heist" is, if anything, a well-executed crime movie,
touching on these deeper issues with a brush of exper
tise.
