character that is shnultaneousK stupid
.md engaging. Keith Lowe has managed
to do just this in I unnel Vision," the lat

And\ bets that he can go through even
station 011 the l übe in a single dav. And
he doesn't bet money. He bets Ins pass
port. his travel card. Ins tic kets to Paris
(where the wedding is to t.ike place), his
credit card and the train tickets for the
hone\ moon.
If Andv fails, the wedding is oil. I lis
fiancee, Rachel, informs liim that she
will be on the train to Paris with or with
out him.
Although And\ allows his love lot the
l übe to threaten even tiling he ought to
c are about most, one can't quite help but
like him. Kvervones had something they
liked <1 little too much (a film, <1 I V show,
a series of books, whatever), everyone's
done something stupid and not realized
just how stupid it was until it was too late.
Andv isn't a bad fellow, he's just a bit,
well, stupid.
" funnel Vision" chronicles the single

<la\ Andy lias to make his way around the
immense maze of the l übe network, and
switches between Andy's desperate race
to hit even station in time and Rachel's
argument with herself about how to deal
with him.

they in to make it through a day from
hell. I veil more importantly. l.oweclear
l\ did his homework when it comes to the
l übe. Kadi line is presented 1 11 vivid de
tail. from the way the trains sound to the
smell of the tunnels, and the moment-by
moment present tense narration of
And\ 's side of the storv makes one feel the
book (ould be used .is a guide to duplicate
Andy's route.
Accompanyning Andy is a homeless
drunk named Brian. Brian essentially lives
on the l übe, and lias a background similar
to Andv's. I le too let stupidity threaten his

relationship with a woman. Brian serves as
hotli traditional conscience and cheer
leader to Andy, and adds an element of
sanitv in the whirlwind of mania through
which Andy is moving.
Ultimately, " Funnel Vision" is about
Andy's struggle to balance his obsession
with the Tube and his love for Rachel.
Rachel, too, has to decide whether to ac
cept Andy, obsession and all, or move on.
I hat serious current underlies the often
hysterically funny narrative, lending ten
sion to Andy's struggle against delayed
trains, suicidal passengers, unpleasant of
ficials and his "friend" Rolf.
Although " funnel Vision" is probably
not a book for those who only read fan
tastic or science fiction, it will strike a
chord with those who have a fondness
for imperfect characters, dry humor and
the crazy things love and obsessions can
make us do.
