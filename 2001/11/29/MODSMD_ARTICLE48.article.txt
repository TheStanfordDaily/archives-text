So imagine m\ reaction when 1 stum
bled upon ibis old "Fntertaininent Week
l\ interview with Richard Roeper.
Interviewer: "What's your least fa

Richard Roeper: 'Tin not a big 'Wi/ar<

For weeks, (lolumbus li.is been skipping

Yisualh. the film is wonderful. I he spe

And the cast is charming. I lie three central
actors look and act perfect, as if stiaighl
from Rowling's pages: Daniel Radclifle as
llarrv: Fmma Watson as I lermione; Ru
pert (irint as Ron.
I here's .ilso a reliable band of support
ing actors. Maggie Smith is a vivid Prof.
McConagall. Man Rickmau rumbles with
evil undertones as the diabolic-looking
Snape. Richard Harris makes a noble
headmaster Duinbledore, a grand S.inta
Clans of sorts.
But the problem with the film — and it's
a big one — grows niainlv out ofC.oluin-

bus's hands. Fver\ scene looks
like a jagged mosaic from the
books' more developed
pieces. Ilart\ doesn't stand
alone; it would crumble if the
stor\ bad not alreadv been

I was not bored with the
movie. \nd* I'm sure thai

books will eniov the adapta-

tion, mainh because the\ will sir the char
acters come to lilt-. Hut the film is also not
light on its lot-s. The stor\ line is missing
thai essential sense of wondei that perme
ated Rowling's first novel.

As .1 cantankerous uncle tells Harry:
" I here's no such thing as magic."
After watching "Harr\ Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone." I'm inclined to think
(llnis (lolumhus believes the same thing.


I'm not that innocent
