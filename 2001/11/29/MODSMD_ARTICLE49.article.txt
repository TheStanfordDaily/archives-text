# 'Novocaine' a numbing experience
## 
### MATTHEW RICE 
Finally! A sequel to "Little Shop of Horrors!' Ok, so no
such luck. But Steve Martin does reprise his role as a dentist,
albeit as a much less interesting, straight-laced dentist, in
"Novocaine."
As Dr. Frank Sangster, Martin plays the good guy caught
up in an ever increasing web of sex, drugs and murder. A
drug addict seduces him in his dentist's chair, his brother
shows up toask for money, and the result, predictably, is that
our erstwhile hero is pulled in over his head. With some no
table exceptions, hilarity does not ensue.
Martin follows his role in David Mamet's "The Spanish
Prisoner" as another straight man. But lit- drops the air ol
mystery, and picks up a much more "L.A. Story"-ish bum
bling innocent affection, including the everpresent, annoy
ing narration. Martin is certainly capable, but the story just
lurches from c risis to crisis. It would take a I lerc ulean effort
in both script and performance to allow Martin to save this

failing plot, and
here he's just not up
to the iii>k.
U nfort unately,
the supporting cast
doesn't add much.

merol lix. Sangster's loser brother Harlan also enters tlu

scene (played by Klias Koteas). lint
these actors' talents are wasted on
strangely ll.it, one dimensional charac
ters. Kven worse is Ivy's brother, who
bursts into incomprehensible rage dur
ing even screen appearance. The char
acters certainly represent everything
unseemly — everything tlt.u is lacking
from Dr. Sangster's sterile existence —
but their depravity is strangely unex
plained and strangely uninteresting.
There are two things that make this
film matinee or rental-worthy. First,
writer/director David Atkins effectively
draws on his experience as a dentist's
son to create some laugh-out-loud den
tist office antics during the first twenty
minutes of the film. Everything from
trouble patients to the strange dynam
ics of dentist-staff relations is examined
with a cruelly effective eye.
Second, and more importantly,
I .a lira Dern's performance as the obses
sive-compulsive hygienist hits a perfec t
tone of saccharine sweetness. Her por
trayal of Jean Noble is the picture per
fect fiancee, who is sexually ravenous, a
great hygienist (she even practices on

11 u- weekends. Sangster explains), and tan make a sump
tions banana bread to boot. Hue weren't a I read \ suspicious,
her obsessive-compulsive behaviot is revealed later in some
of the films' onl\ glimpses of genius.
I nfortunately. even these gems can't save Novocaine
from being a generallx numbing experience. We've seen the
story of one little lie leading to a whole heap of trouble too
many times for this lackluster version to be worth more than
a i ursor\ viewing. In the end, you'd need a healtln dose of
laughing gas to enjo\ this dai k comedy that is neither dark
enough nor funnv enough to be compelling.


Wait! Dentists don't do pap smears!
