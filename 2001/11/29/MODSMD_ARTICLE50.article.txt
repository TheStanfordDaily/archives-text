back and forth in time and space, and
characters switch roles, both literally and

evil rebel!" Ihe play
isn't about condemning
any particular villain or
crime, but revolution,
compromise, guilt and
murder as universal
human events.

"B\ being broader, it's an inclusive liis
tor\, Nordt said. "And audience mem

thi> didn't really happen this way.' 1U
being explicith generic, audience mem
bers can't make excuses for the show. It
also broadens it out past Latin America as
well, to look .it revolution and politics in
other regions of the world."
Ultimately, " I bin Air" is .1 play ofques
tions, rather than answers. 1U having ac
tors |>la\ different parts, and through the

role reversals of the story itself, the play
creates .1 feeling that identity is fluid, ever
changing, and it forces us to think about
the contradictions within both the charac
ters and ourselves.
I he audience tries to understand the
rebel who has committed horrible crimes
in what he considers .1 good cause, the
general who had his best friend impris
oned <ind tortured to protect himself and
who now runs .1 small cafe in Miami and
the soldier who stabs Alex and steals his
watch, but closes the play by tenderly
helping a homeless (hild get to sleep.
" Thin Air" forces us to confront other
questions: can you ever be truly apolitical?
(Lan you ever escape from the crimes and
mistakes of your past? 1 low much blood is
on your hands?
file play doesn't tell us. but it helps us
to think about these issues, which is exact
ly what Nordt intended.
"I want people to think," she said. "I
want people to face the issues that 'Thin
Air' raises and realize that, yes, this is a fic
tion in that it's an artistit production . . .
but it's real.
The history is true. I want people to
have to face that. 11 people are thinking
after the show, and if it conies back to them
a few davs later, some of the images stick, I
will feel like I have succeeded."
