daughters, was his mistress for many years, and his wife,
Armande, was ol dubious parentage. Depending upon
u horn you believe, she is either Madeleine's daughter fa
thered In Moliere, or another man, or Madeleine's sister.
I lis works are emblematic of his times: stock plots, de
rived chiefly from the Roman stable of theatre that drew
life from skilled acting rather than inspired text. It is
here that loin Gough's production of "The Miser" is ex
posed. Moliere conceived his characters as "phantoms to
delight the audience," infused with flesh and blood by
the ingenuity of the actors portraying them.

|oe Harra, as ( leante. strikes the right note. He is
vain and self obsessed in true 17th ( enturv Parisian
fashion. Man McClloin as Klise (flarpagon's daughter)
looks like she has jusi emerged from an appearance on
|crr\ Springer. Her clothes constantlv threaten to fall
off. without actualh doing so. At least that is .1 distrac
tion from the histrionics. |im Marburv as Master
Jacques (the cook cum coachman) delivers a good
cameo, if One can forget the small matter of protean ac
cents. He doesn't seem to know if lie s from Yorkshire,
Fssex, France or America, and treats us to a melange of
his versions of these accents.
Kathleen Dobbs, as Marianne, is unremarkable. Mar
ianne is perhaps best known outside France as the
buxom, bare-breasted and barefoot revolutionary storm
ing the barricades in Delacroix's Liberty Leading the
People: frock unfurled, bayonet in one hand. French flag

in lilt' oilier, red

now Laetitia

along. Now she

vixen that every

craves.
Molie r e ' s

Marianne pre
dated all this. But a contemporary interpretation
would definitely have demanded due attention to this
icon. In Dobbs as Marianne, we see an anorexic and
limp character that is singularly lacking in vim or
vigor. I lie Miser is best enjoyed by keeping one's
money in one's purse.
