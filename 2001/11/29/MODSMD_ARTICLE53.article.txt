"Amelie" was the surprise hit of last year's

(lanlies l-ilm festival, vet ironically wasn't
even selected to be a festival entr). Instead of
watt liing the selected (lannes films, many of
the critics instead sneaked away to watch
"Amelie," which was playing in the normal
theaters to rave reviews. As we approach
Dead Week, and the hours mount in the cat
acombs of Green library, I strongly recom
mend following this example and sneaking
awav tor some frivolous Parisian magic.


And that's why I eat cheerios for breakfast.
