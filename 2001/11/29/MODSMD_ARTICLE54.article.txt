Autonin Dvorak was ,i torn
num. I Ir lived and composed ai a
time* when the Austrian empire
controlled his native countn ol
Czechoslovakia. Like main
prominent artists of his time, Dvo
rak wished to sec Czechoslovakia
rise to independence and did all
he conld to support the cause.
I low does a composer champi
on such an ideal? Selling the violin,
buying a musket and joining the
underground wasn't .111 appealing
option so Dvorak wrote nationalis
tic music, pulling from ethnic
C/ech themes when constructing
his melodies, using traditional
harmonies to 11 eate a distitu 1
Czech sound and grafting all this
onto traditional rhvthms from
( zee li folk datu es.
Unfortunateh tor our hero,
becoming .1 composer of interna
tional acclaim meant conforming

to one ot the etas two major
compositional schools ol
thought. Brahms' 01 Wagner s.

Despite the inlluencesol Wagn
er and Bt.ihmsaud pressure from
his publivhct. Dvorak tctained his
unique sound, and nowhere is it
more pronounced titan in his Sev
enth Symphony. Fhesvmphom is
e\(|iusitel\ constructed, full ol
tnelanchob melodies characteris
tic ot Dvorak's tragic naiion.ilism.
It is rich in emotion and often
proud: 'a battle s\inphonv , in the
words ot Fridax night's speaker.
I'he San Francisco Symphony,
led In Bernhard Klee, captured
the mood of the piece quite well. I
was particularly impressed with
the third movement: the strings
were lively and Ivrical. and the
syncopated theme trub danced.
Kiev's tempos in the fourth move
ment were also fantastic, albeit dif
ferent, and I found bis use of 111-
bato quite musical. Il is somewhat
unfortunate that the orchestra
had trouble keeping up with his
brisk pace and that, at times. thc\
were somewhat sloppx.
I his was not the case during
Bruch's Violin Concerto, per
formed by Vadim Repin. Orches
tra and soloist were well re-

first note. Repin exhibited a
(hemistn with the playet s,choos
ing solid imisicalitx over ostenta
tious technicalilN in his interpre
tation .uul offering further proof
that one need not be flashy to
please a crowd.
1 he performance was a hit. So
much so that Repin played, not
one, bin two encores that night.

prompted an improvised perfor
mance of "The I luce Cornered
Hat." Phis was accompanied b\
pi//u ato c 1101 ds 111 the strings and
main .1 laugh from the audience.
Repin is apparentb quite the
ladv's man. though you wouldn't
know it lioui the head shot iu his |

with the dark-haired Russian,
