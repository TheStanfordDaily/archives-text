## The
						Stanford Daily Protesters' behavior hurts themselves and cause 
### 
Yesterday, six students were arrested
in a protest against the sulxontract
ingol hospital woi kcrsat the Medical
('.enter alter a rally that started at
Memorial Auditorium and worked its wa\ to
the Stanford I lospital.
Alti r a group ol protesters attempted to
force its wa\ into theottice ol the hospital s \ id-
President lor (ieneral Sen 1 ices Lou Saksen,
they were ordered to lease l)\ sec in it\ person
nel. I hose who refused to do so were subse
quent 1\ arrested I>\ Palo Alto Police olliccrs.
I he behavior ol mam <>l the students ves
terd.i\ was out ol line. Forcing entry, making
unreasonable, on-the-spot demands and \n
balh harassing lniversit\ officials is neilhei
constructive nor appropri.ite.
I'his is not to say th.it we deride the cause it
selfâ€” in tact, we admire the students Ibi
standing up lor a cause in which thc\ believe
and acting to effect social change. In recent
days, they have organized meetings with the

administration and a series ol campus-wide
events to draw attention to the issue. Ona cam
pus often < riticized lor general student apathy,
it is encouraging to see individuals taking ac -
tion to influence an issue they < are about.
However, given all the circumstances, the
mantlet in which the students acted is alarm
ing and potentially counter'prodiu tive.
Surely, the arrests and ensuing e-mail lot
wards caused a whirlwind of controversy on
campus. Yesterday, rumors abounded about
the events at the hospital and latei at Build
ing 10. However, the protesters' actions did
not rails most Stanford students to the cause;
on the ( ontrary, their extremist nature alien
ated many.
II the goal of the protesters was to garner
support for their cause among students, the
best wa\ to realize that would have been
through the dissemination ol information and
promotion of dialogue in a wav that respects
students intelligence and open-mindedness.

When groups can make their appeals in such
a manner, they often succeed in inspiring oth
ers to their cause.
111 dealing with the officials who make poli
cy decisions, reasonable discourse is and has
always been tlu- most effective wav of airing
grievances. Karliei this week, members of the
Stanford Labor Action Committee organi/.eel
rallies, talked with key I niversity officials and
on liiesda\ met with Saksen for more than <)()
minutes. I ntil yesterday, the activism was re
sponsible and presumably productive.
Bv forcing their way into an office of a Uni
vcrsit\ official and making explicit demands,
the students demonstrated a staggering level
of temerity. 1 hev were arrested fora reason:
thev broke the law.
Students involved with these protests have
stated repcatcdlv that the- University has re
fused to listen to their grievances. However,
meetings were held, and it is important to
point out that it is possible to listen to views

and yet disagree with them.
When student protesters resort to such rad
ical measures in order to make their voices
heard, they damage overall student credibility
with the administration. Protest is an essential
right o! all members ot a community, but it is
one that should not be abused.
II the protesters' purpose was to gain atten
tion, they succeeded. If, however, their pur
pose was to convince other students and the
administration that subcontracting is unjust,
they have gone about it in the wrong way.
