We bet you she
would reallv, realb
like to hear IVom
her readers on 111 i>
subject.
Sime there is ab
solnteK no wa\ to

make a subtle transition to our topic
this week, we'll 111.ike no pretenses.
|ust read on il you still < are.
Set lion is ostensibb a place w here
you go to learn the inn ii at ies of ma
terial presented in lecture. llowcy
er, it gets hard to learn when halfol
your classmates in there meet the
clinical re(|iiirements for psy
chotropic drug treatment. I lave you
seen these people ?
Long-winded jackass: I his
moron uses grandiose hand ges
tures m an attempt to elucidate his
incoherent ideas, thinking il will
make him seem smarter. Incorrect,
sir. If, when you raise your hand to
say something, full\ halfol the c lass
[lacks its bags and exits the room,
SHUT I NK HKLL UP.
It hurts to talk: Spoken language
is a complex process — we'll grant
you that—but it general!) doesn't
induce physical pain. However,
there's always that one girl who
sounds like- even syllable she utters
is a knife stabbing her in the kidney.
Even when the I A is taking roll:
"Mike?" "Here. "John?" "Here.
"Sally? Heee-rre." I hen everyone
states in horror, waiting for her
head to explode or her to break into
tears, like "but he loves me! It's im
fault that he hits me." I hat is sacl.
Domestic abuse is very vcr\ wrong.
Foreigners: These people are
funny. First, though, a definition:
Indians ((instantly refer to some
other Indians (mostly grad stu
dents) as l Obs. or "Fresh Off the
Boat." I his is not a derogatory term!
It simply serves to desc rilie the c liar
acterislics of newly imported for
eigners, such as tight sweaters that
smell like India and Velcro shoes.

( i • 11 s1111 i (i liis i eall\ happened): in a
recent econ (lass, the I A was dis

working the door at
Moonsplash aw bile

saunters up to the

Nortnalh. no problem, but then
his friend turns to Doug and sa\s.

Something needs to he done, and
<l uic kly. ()nl\ a proposal of the most
robust construction can remedy this
grave injustice, suffered by so many
of our dear and faithful brethren.
Who has the audacity to propose
such a solution? Not Hennessy. Not
Wais. Mavbe Simon Stert/er il given
some time. I lie answer is I wo Guys
Who Are Better I ban You. I bus,
we implore you. I As and professors:
c rack down on these violators of the
lowest order. Don't let them talk 10
seconds before class ends. Don't let
them ask 15-minutcquestions. ()nce
that girl vocali/es her pain, do not
ever let her talk again. And—aw,
the hell with this, let's get something
to eat. Not at I lie Daily, though.
