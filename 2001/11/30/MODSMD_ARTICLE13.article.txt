Protest organizers justify actions, call for
further support
II there is one message I lu'p. 11 (ic.ip.inlsol ves
terd.is's peaceful r.»ll\ would like to stress, u is
ili.il the issues th.it we are lighting lor remain
unaddrcs>cd. I lie 10 housekeeping positions
an* still in danger ol lieing sulKontr.it ted. setting
a precedent that would open the (Kn>i loi the
sulk outraging ol'the remaining 110 positions.
()vei theioui seof the past \e.ii. studentsand
workers have come together to identih i oiisiv
tent prohlems with St an lord's lalxn practices
oneol the most signilu ant being sul h out rat ling.
I o this end. there has I wen a const ienti< n is and
dedicated movement on (lie part ol numerous
organizations to address these issues.
Yestcrd.n's actions represent a decisive
move to hold out I nivetsih account.thle; we
believe our non-\ iolent action is justilied. Siu
dent arrests were a result ol consistcnth negli
gent heha\ioi on the pan ol the administration,
not student desire to sensationalize the issue.
I he administration has heen negligent and
non-cooperative in stopping lurthet sulhoii
t lading. I- ver\ othei at t ion outside ol the meet
ings with administration hasalst > tailed: pet it k >n
signatures, organized phone-hanking, lacult\
support, a resolution from the ASS I and work
to educate the connnunit\ ha\e all tailed to
make the admit list rat ion recognize the urgent \
ol toi ici ting lalxn injustice.
It reflects poorh on the I niversitv that it
should take student arrests before committing
to a mere meeting between students and their
INesitlent; one wonders it tlu-1 nivei sit\ has re
alized the extent and the urgent \ ol this issue to
workers and students.
Finally, w age ant I liencfit pt ilit ies have an im

For this reason, the ASS I Senate. BSI ,
MEChA, PASI . SLA( . \VS V S\\ \( . S( l»|
and SF.AS united with hospital workers and
union organizers to demand that the positions
not be sulxontrai ted. tli.it the universih en.it t a

oversight mechanism is implemented, and that
the administration make the commitment to

We thank those who have demonstrated

Student disappointed by protester behavior
Today I. as I'm sure many other students
did, ret eived an e-mail forward concerning the
protest at the hospital and the arrest of live stu
dents. Hie e-mail suggested ilt.it we mobilize in
vat ious ways, including contacting the media, to
make our views known. Somehow, I doubted
they meant lot us to contact the media with
opinions that do not concur with those ex
pressed in the e-mail. However, I would feel
fraudulent to do otherwise. From what I have
personally seen of this issue, the wider view of
" I lie Stanford Community" may not really be
realistically represented in the actions of the
pr< >t esters or in the sentiments ofthe e-mail that
was forwarded.
If you are n< >t wan tecl in a perse >n's < >llice and
you get your arm caught trying to keep that
person from closing their door to keep you out,

that sounds to me like \ou are attempting
lon ed enir\. It doesn't sound like you are being
assaulted. II \ou have It) be Ibrcibh removed
lioin that sametltxii In sr ( uril\ personnel, that
doesn't sound like voifrc being assaulletl ei
llier. I hat sounds like \ou are guilts of clisor
tlerh conduct and violation ol both proper!\
and privac \ rights.
"| I |he light of the people to peaceably as
semble' is inviolate, but when vou lr\ It) remain
<tii private properl\ unwanted, n has eased to
be peaceable assemblv. You aren't ;i.ssenibling
01 protesting am nit ire.vou'rc breaking the law
And when that happens, (Surprise surprise*)
people are often limes arrested.
I lie e-mail made one good point, it vou take
ii out of context: "STI DENTS DO \() I
Mi l) K) HI ARKFS'I I D 1\ ORDER l()
bRI N(. All F.N I lON It) AN FNIM.OI IA
FIVE, t Nll si. AND DISCRIMINATORY
I'RAC l ICE."
II a pracl.iie truh lils am of those adjectives,
\ou (.in probabh bring attention to it without
breaking the law and gelling vourselt arrested,
li s true thai in the past, people have been ar
rested lor tr\ ing to bring attention to an issue
peaceablv, but none ol them were trving to
force entn into an private oil ice. If anyone re
members a lew basic tacts almut iheearlv, .it 1-
inirable part ol the ( nil Rights movement,
ihev'll remember thai no matter how ninth
iheir (.uise was ignored or how hrutalh the\
were dealt with, the strength of their struggle
was a moral and menial one. Fhe\ never tried
lolort e opei idt Kirs or tried to resist set uril\'s at
tempts to removetliein. 11ie\ managedto gain
support and s\inpatln from the populace. I lie
protesters t(Hlay did the tippt >site as lai as I per
sonal!) am concerned.
So. to sum up: Don't Ik- so quick to assume
what all ol " I he St an lord ('oniniunitv" thinks.
Respect people's rights, even il \ou don't agree
with their prat tit es. Aggression in the name ol
just it e is stupid and counlerprt itltit live.

Student behavior 'despicable'
Avoiding the politu sol this situation (though
1 will state for the record that I am against sub
tout rat ting workcrs.it the hospital), I wanted to
write to the I)ail\ to speak out against the l>e
haviorol m\ fellow students and against the pre
sumption of the students wholx'gan circulating
the "Five Students Arrested" e-mail at large.
First, and foremost, the e-mail: 1 found it to
!x' a piece of sensational, biased and intentional
l\ misleading piece of'trash. It reminded me of
the many reasons that 1 HA I F the modem
media. It did N() I give a clear and factual ac -
count of the events that took place at Saksen's of
fice but rather resorted to overly strong lan
guage to provoke an emotional reaction in its
readers. \Vcll, it certainly worked, but not in the
wax that the writer intended, for I was com
pletely turned off to the "plight" of the arrested
students.
Furthermore, I was very offended that the
writer had the presumption to sign the letter
"The Stanford (lomtnunity." Neither the letter,
nor the way it was written, reflect my opinion or
the opinion of the entire community. That mis
representation was just another part ol the de
ceit present throughout the e-mail.
As for my fellow students' behavior: I am
very VFRY disappointed. I will be completely
blunt. When I first heard ofthcsub-contracting
issue, I didn't give a damn. But because of the

persistence of in\ activist peers and because of
the quality of their educational campaign, I
have gradualK been won over to their t ause. I
haven't joined with the protestors vet, i>iit I had
been seriousK considering it — I N I 11. N( )W\
Now I am totalK and utterh disgusted by die
behavior of the leaders of this campaign. It is
dear to me that tliev were not harmlessly
protesting at Sakscn's office. I'hev were ties
passing on private propertx and harassing him
at bis place ol work. IN 11 IS ()FFI( I.for (it id's
sake. 1 bis is unact eptable. I hev bad 110 right to
accost him there, in sut b .1 manner.
W hen be declined to respond to their ha
rassment. the\' refused to hack off but instead at
tempted to 1 ; ( )l\( 112. their wa\ into bis oflic e. I
would call that "breaking and entering." Are
these students movers tor sot tal ( hange or are
the) common criminals? IVtause there was 110
reasoning with these rude, 1111 c onst ionable stu
dents.the hospital stall regrettabl\ had toresort
to tailing in sennit v, who apparentlv had to
l'R\ the students from the door. "Abuse? (live
me a break. Rodne\ King was abused; these
students weie I\l \l( )\ 1 I). like rabid animals.
It is t lear to me now that these students don't
tare alxxit the issues or alxiut enacting real, tMis
it ive change in a dignified, pcaeelul manner. It is
clear to me that the\ arc hasicalK sensation.ilists.
attempting to create news stones with their
names in them. 1 he\ lx'lieve that tliev are the
next generation of s< * ial martyrs. W ell, they are
wrong because thc\ are simply immature,
spoiled hooligans. Because of tlieii thoughtless
at lions, the hospital administrators will ccrtainh
NIA I K listen to the activists' arguments now;
win should they, when the leaders are so irra
tional and out of control that thc\ would assault
Sakson in his ven own office? I know tine thing;
because oftheirdespiccableljehavioi. I will never
listen to them again. I issue a call to the other ac
tivists: tot usoll the ISSI Kandleave these fools to
the fate thc\ have wrought for themselves.

ASSU action 'excludes dissenters '
Yesterda\ «i numlxTof students were an est
od in regards to protests surrounding the sub
contracting ol work .ii 11 ic Medical Center. Yet,
tli.it is not what I am writing to you alxuit.
I lie actions taken In the ASSI lo condone
(lie protests and <i spec ific opinion alxuit a polit
ical issue not directh aflecting the business of
the ASSI Ii should fx* (lie goal of the ASSU,
like Stanford I niversit\ in general, to promote
dialogue among indi\iduals of Opposing opin
ions on campus. During Sophomore College,in
response to Sept. 1 1, (ierhard (lasper said tli.it
students should not call on the I niversit\ to
take a position on what was later lalx'led the
'War Against Terrorism", because lie saw it as
the dutv of an academic institution to promote
disc ussion, which would he inhibited by any po
sition the University could take.
I lie same ethos should he applied to the
ASSI J. By the nature of the petition, the ASSU,
supposedly representing all students, excludes
those dissenters who do not agree with (lie
groups with whom the ASSU has aligned. If our
ASSU Senators feel so strongly alxuit the issue
of labor "rights" they should join SLAC in
protesting, hut they should not infringe on our
ability to earn out an open dialogue and dis
cussion nor should alienate any students who
use their seiviees.
