tonight against Nevada (17-7) at
7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"There's kind of a sense of ur
gency, but we're all excited be
cause we're playing really well
right now," said senior middle
bloc ker Tara Conrad. "We know
we have a good shot. We're better

than we were two years ago, and
we finished second that sear."
After claiming the Pat ific 10
Conference title, Stanford enters
the N( AAs as one of the clear-( lit
favorites to take it all.
