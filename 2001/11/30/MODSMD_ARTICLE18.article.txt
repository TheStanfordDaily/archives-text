### ANTHONY LEE STAFF WRITER 
In <1 season that may place the 2001
Stanford football team alongside some
of the greatest squads ever put together
on the Farm, many individual players
have garnered postseason recognition
at their respective positions by various
media outlets.
Running back and kickoff return man
Brian Allen, offensive lineman Eric Heit
mann, free safety lank Williams and
linebacker Coy Wire, all seniors, were
among this year's First-Team /Ml-Pacific
10 Conference selections.
Redshirt freshman wide receiver
Feyo fohnson was named co-Pac-10
Freshman of the Year along with Wash
ington's freshman sensation wideout
Reggie Williams.
Heitmann, sophomore punt returner
Luke Powell and Williams have also been

recognized as Ail-Americans by various
publications.
Relentlessly anchoring arguahl) one
of the nation's best offensive lines, 11 fit -
mann has been instrumental in open
ing holes for Stanford's successful rush
ing attack this season and was one of
just three unanimous first team All Pac
-10 selections.
"He gets great leverage on his
blocks," said Stanford offensive line
coach John McDoncll.
Also voted a First-1 earn All-American
by Football News, Heitmann brings
toughness into the trenches that has al
lowed the Cardinal to establish an intimi
dating running game, which helps ease
the pressure ofl its quarterback.
In fact, Allen and junior Kerry
Carter rushed fora combined 1,293
yards before Carter was sidelined with a
separated shoulder.
As a testament to the offensive line's
success, which also includes Second
ream All-Pac-10 selections sophomore
right tackle Kwame Harris, junior guard
Greg Schindler and senior center Zack
Quaccia, redshirt freshman running back
Kenneth Tolon has baldly missed a beat.

Filling in for the injured Carter, lolon
lias already rushing for !l2. r > yards and
three touchdowns in the last three games.
Another reason for Stanford's success
has been its stellar defense.
Stanford defenders, who have been
placed in horrible field positions numer
ous times this season because of costly
turnovers and dreadful special teams, are
better than the !H). I points that they have
allowed this season.
A good reason for that is the presence
of Wire and Williams, who are the ('.ai di
nars two superstars behind a workman
like front, which includes senior defensive
end Marcus I loover, who was selec ted to
the All-Pac-10 Second Team.
Both are safety prospects in the NFL
and their spectacular play this year has
made it seem as if they were competing
with each other on the field.
Wire, often playing with various in
juries, has been a warrior with 80 tackles,
10 of which were fora loss.
Williams is also a fierce force in the sec
ondary. Living up to his moniker by hit
ting receivers with tremendous force,
Williams lias f)3 tackles and five in
terceptions in a season that saw
him become a Football News Sec
ond- leam All-American.
As sound as Stanford lias been
on the offensive line and on de
fense, no player has altered more
games in the Pac-10 than Johnson.
"[Teyo] athletically could play
18, 17 positions if he wanted,"
Stanford head coach Tyrone Will
ingham said.

Alter being moved from quar
terback to wide receiver in the
spring. Johnson has used his intan
gibles—an incredible combination
of size, strength and athleticism —
to lead the Cardinal with 38 c atc h
es this season.
In what is becoming known as
the "Teyo Tossup," a lob to the 6-
foot-7 receiver, Johnson has
proven to be both Stanford's safetv
valve and most dangerous threat
inside the t ed/one.
As the season has progressed,
Johnson has familiarized himself
with the receiving position by mak
ing tough catches over the middle

of the field to get "possession"
yards in addition to using an array
of basketball-style spin moves and
strength to break oil long runs
after the catch.
The lightning to Johnson's
thunder, Powell was Stanford's
first First-Team Ail-American
return specialist when he was
distinguished by the Football
Writers Association of America
on Tuesday.
In addition to Ix'ing Stanford's
most dangerous deep threat, Powell
led the nation in punt return yards
for most of the season. He is c ur
rently eighth with a 13.6 average.
