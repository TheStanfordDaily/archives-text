Sorrv lor .ill the formalities, bin the times have
changed." said a sec 111 it \ of lit ial .ti San Francisco Inter
national Airport iliis past I hanksgixing weekend.
I iines ceriainh havet hanged, and while the terrorist
attacks of Sept. I 1 have influenced virtual!) even'aspect
of American life, some of the greatest cllec tshavebeenon
the airline industn and the trawl plans of Americans.
I fere on campus, main students have been left won
dering how and it ihe\ will travel this holidav season.
Freshman Frank Sotelo, who was previousK plan
ning on living home to I .os Angeles for winiei break, lias
decided instead to drive.
"It's not that I would necessarih be s< a red of flung,
but m\ parents decided that it would be best for me to
drive," he said. "Sept. I 1 showed us that anything can
happen; it's the uncertaint\ more than anvthing else
that made us dei itle on dri\ing."
()ther students,ire less coin erned about the safety of
travel since the attacks and are even reassured by the
new set in it\ measures in plate at most airports.
"Now isprobabh the safest time to travel because of
the heightened se< urit\." saitl freshman Rob Bovle. "It
might be a little slower than before, but it seems to be a
whole lot more set lire."
I he airline industiA could fate losses of up to $10 bil
lion fbi the \ear, according to industry analysts, with
mut h of this loss attributed to the recent recession and
(let leased passenger volume since the attacks on New
York. Washington, 1 >.("... and Penns\ Ivania.
1 he Nov. 12 crash of an American Airlines jet in
Queens, N A ~ .ilso did little to i est ore coniidence in
air travel.
" 1 lie numbers |ol travel reservations] have
dropped," s.iitl Mania Shah, managei of the Adventure
I ravel Network branch in I residder. "We have seen al
most a 50 pert cut drop in s.iles from last year."
Shah noted, however, that other fat tors, siu h .is an
increase in online pun bases, ina\ also at tount for some
of the losses.
But while passenger volume has dropped since Sept.
11, experts maintain that it is sale to travel and that in-

creased security has made it even
safer to IK than belbre the attacks.
"It's safer than before." said
Capt. Stephen I)Â«i\is. a six-war
pilot for Southwest Airlines. "But
it's more of a hassle, and that's
going to have to change because
people aren't going to put up with
it much longer."
As far as the attitudes of passen
gers, Davis said lie has found most
to be "more tolerant and more pa
tient" lb.in they were before.

neering Prof, .ind former Defense
Secretary William Perry is equally
conviiu ed ol the s.ilctv of Hying.
" I have made six round trips to
the fast ('.oast since Sept. 11, so
that I guess indicates that 1 think
its safe to travel," he said. "And as
a matter ol fact, aii travel has been
easier to conduct and with fewer
delays than before the attacks. I
have no problem recommending
people to travel."
Freshman C hris I'ratt said the
convenience of Hying is difficult to
overlook. "[The current environ
ment] makes me more conscious,
but I'm not s< a red to the extent that
I'd be willing to sacrifice conve
nience lor safety," he said.
Not all traveleis have been re
assured b\ ramped up seiurit\
measures.
"The only problem I see with
travel now is that so-called 'set urii\'
can use random searches as an ex
i use to racialh profile." said fresh

man Seyi Akanni. In her opinion,
these measures risk (lassifying a dis
proportionate number of Arabs as
potential terrorists.
"They don't say that, but that s
[whom] they deem suspicious,
she said.
Perry cautioned against fo< us
ing exclusively on air travel safe
ty at the expense of other securi
ty needs.
"There's so much attention
that's been put on airplane travel
that terrorists are not likely to
choose airplanes as a target." he
said. "I'm not saving that they
never will attack airplanes again,
but I would look for the next attack
coming somewhere else."
While travelers are contemplat
ing the safety of flying and re-ex
amining holiday plans, the airline
industry has lowered prices in an
attempt to bring travelers back into
the skies.
" 1 he airlines and the travel
agencies have done everything they
can to make everybody feel com
fortable again to fly," Adventure
I ravel's Shah said.
Still, the airline industry ap
pears to face turbulent skies
ahead. A Callup Poll conducted
earlier this month found that
percent of Americans who were
planning on flying during
I hanksgiving or Christmas are
now less likely to take a plane be
cause of the terrorist attacks.
Phil Conclit, CEO of Boeing,
said in a meeting in Chicago this
week that it could take more than
three years for air travel to return to
the levels seen before Sept. 1 1. Boe
ing has laid oil nearly 15,000 em
ployees since the attacks.
