MEN'S BASKETBALL
Tomorrow: No. 9 Stanford vs. Texas, 11 a.m.,
Chicago, IL

I lungs have changed a little bit since then.
First off. since the departure of basketball
great Michael Jordan, the I nited Center is
rarely packed anymore.
And secondly, Lottich and his new team aren't the
opening act.
Almost seven years later, l.ottich will return to
('.hie ago with the No. 9 (lardinal at his side fora battle
against unranked I exas.
I he Stanford men's basketball team (3-0) is oil and
running this season and will find itself in Chicago on
Saturday to participate in the ('.lassie lor Kids.
I'lie Cardinal and 1 exas entered this season with
diflering ex pec tations. Stanford was expected to give
up its three-year reign on the Pac-10 throne while the
l.onghorns were supposed to grab a piece of the na
tional spotlight lor the first lime in a longtime.
"We want the I ni\ersit\ of 1 exas to climb into the
top 10 earlv in the year and stay there for the duration
of the season." said I exas head coach Rick Barnes be
fore the season began. "That's what I want. That's
what our plavers want. And I hope that's what our fans
want, because that's where this thing is headed."
Since Barnes' optimistic season-opening statement,
the l.onghorns have gone 1-3, losing to No. 3 Arizona.
No. 24 Indiana and unranked Con/aga.

Texas' only victory came against unranked Ore
gon State last Tuesday in the Alaska Shootout held in
Anchorage.
1 his northern locale wasn't the only thing cold
about this struggling Longhorns team right now.
In its season home opener, Texas lost to then-un
rankcd Arizona 88-74 alter freshman point guard'T.J.
l ord was sidelined with a sprained ankle at halftime.
While Arizona has catapulted itself into the rank
ings with several upsets, Texas has since dropped out
of the nation's top 25.
Despite the hard luck Texas has endured this sea
son. the I .onghorns should give the C Cardinal a run for
its money.
Who does Stanford have to watch lor?
Mainly senior ('.hris ()wens, who should he one of
the top power forwards in the nation. I le is one of 50
returning players across the country to he named to
the Wooden Award preseason watch list.
()wens watched his stock rise this summer when he
earned the starting power forward job lor the bronze
medal-winning USA Basketball Team at the World
I Diversity Games.
Sophomores Brian Boddicker and James Thomas
will team with Owens to form one of the top front
courts in the Big 12. Both Boddicker and Thomas
earned Big 12 All-Freshman team honors last season.
This frontcourt will challenge a Collins twins-de
pleted Stanford lineup.
The matchup will feature two teams that are living
in the shadows ol last season's performances.
As the Cardinal struggles to reinvent itself, proving
to the world that it is a viable Pae-10 and NCAA com
petitor. the Longhorns light to prove to themselves that
the) are much better than the team thev were last year.
Regardless of'who comes out the victor on Saturday
afternoon, one thing remains true â€” Chicago fans will
once again get to see what quality basketball looks like.
