### DEENA SKOLNICK STAFF WRITER 
Last night, former St'< retarv <>l the Interi
or Bruce Babbitt discussed the elements
needed to construct an environmental agen
da for the 'J Ist centur\ in <1 speech at kresge
Auditorium.
I he I.aw School's Knvironmental and Nat
ural Resources Law and Policy Program
sponsored the public talk.
"Part of the key [to successful environmen
tal legislation! is persuading people that
there's something more at stake than the view
from their front porch," Babbitt said.
" There's something larger at issue here."
As Secretary of the Interior in the Clinton
Administration, Babbitt gave his support to
environmental issues, including the develop
ment of ecosystem restoration projects in the
Florida Everglades. Since leaving this post, he
has been working as an attorney in Washing
ton, D.C.
In her introduction of Babbitt, Law School
Dean Kathleen Sullivan called him "the great
est champion of the Endangered Species Act."
John Leshy, who worked in the Depart
ment of the Interior under Babbitt as a solici
tor general, said Babbitt was "perhaps the

most qualified individual ever to hold the post
of Secretary of the Interior."
In his opening remarks, Babbitt said the
three most important environmental chal
lenges facing the United States in the next
century are population growth, energy and
climate change and the wa\ humans interne t
with their environment.
Babbitt focused on the third of these c hal
lenge's. addressing the problems with the cur
rent method of land use planning, which he
called "anthropocentric."
"We need to look across tlu- landscape and
the waterscape and assess the needs of the
spec ies there and worry out loud about our eth
ical obligation to the rest of creation." he said.
Babbitt said the United States must change
its paradigm for land use planning from a
purely development-motivated scheme to
one that he described as "ecologically based.
He used the case of development in Los
Angeles as an example. When he was Secre
tary of the Interior, a bird called the gnat
catcher was added to the endangered species
list. Babbitt placed a moratorium on develop
ment in its vast habitat between l.os Angeles
and San Diego, land that would soon be need
ed for housing and other development.
Babbitt described his successful bid to set

some o! this hind aside for the gnatcatclier
while remaining sensitive to the needs of local
developers and residents.
Itabbitt also discussed legislation enac ted by
Ventura (lounty to protect all agricultural land
and open space until voters decide otherwise,
which he praised fort.iking control of the land
