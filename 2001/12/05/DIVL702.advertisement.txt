Under the course heading of Drama 110, students are encouraged to apply for workshops with visiting California artists Mildred
Howard (Visual Art), Mark Izu (jazz and Musical Performance), Aya de Leon (Spoken Word) or Brenda Wong Aoki
(Performing Arts). Students will work with the artists and with community groups through discussions, performances and other
interactive activities at Stanford and in surrounding communities. Through various media, the artist and student projects will
explore the interactions, intersections and meanings of race and space in California as the state enters into the new millennium.
