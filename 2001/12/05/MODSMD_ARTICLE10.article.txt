Alejandro Centurion says he was
detained for almost a full day and as
saulted last month after Chinese po
lice stormed a peaceful protest in
Tiananmen Square.
Centurion, a neurology resident at
Stanford University, said he was
among 25 practitioners of Falun Gong
from 10 nations who flew to China
last month to ask the government to
end the oppression of'tens of thou
sands' of practitioners. Falun Gong is
a tai chi-like exercise that practition
ers say provides health benefits.
The Chinese Communist Party, an
tagonized by the millions who practice
Falun Gong, began a crackdown over
two years ago that has sent tens of
thousands of practitioners to labor
camps and so-called transformation
centers, where violence and terror
reigns, Centurion charged. However,
the Chinese government has denied
such charges.
Centurion was detained by police
for 19 hours and punched in the face
by an officer during his lengthy inter
rogation, he said.
