Regardless <>112 the controversies surround

orous protests against further outsourcing last
Thursday compelled administrators to
schedule a meeting between concerned com
munity members and Hennessy, Provost
John Ktchemendy and Hospital Vice Presi
dent Lou Saksen to review subcontracting
and other labor practices.
On Thursday, Jefl' Wachtel, senior assis
tant to Hennessy, agreed for this meeting to
be scheduled during Wednesday and include
both worker and student representatives; the
Stanford administration has since tried to
postpone the meeting to Thursday and de
cided it is not willing to meet with the worker
representatives, in fact, Hennessy and
Ktchemendy have made their meeting with
students contingent upon the exclusion of
workers.
Last I hursday, after direct student pres
sure, Stanford administrators agreed to meet
with workers and students during an accessi
ble time on Wednesday; only a couple of days
later, Hennessy and Ktchemendy are now
taking retrogressive steps as they insist upon

attempting to disenfranchise workers (roin
voicing their opinions at an important labor
policy meeting.
Contrary to Stanford administration's
belief, Stanford workers have a right to par
ticipate in this meeting. Workers have indi
cated their desire to attend this meeting.
Workers are directly affected by labor poli
cies and have an important perspective to
contribute to any University discussion of
labor practices.
Stanford administrators have no right to
deny workers their voice in reviewing and
correcting problematic labor practices such as
subcontracting.
If the University is to remain credible in its
stated respect for and commitment to work
ers, then the Hennessy and Ktchemendy
must meet with Stanlord workers without
showing bad faith attempts to avoid this im
portant dialogue altogether.
