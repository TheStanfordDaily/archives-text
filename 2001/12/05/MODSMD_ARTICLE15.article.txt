Last veal it happened lo me. Kinalb
ni\ brother .11it I sisiei were grow n up
enough that thc\ tlidn I have lo be
hailned from (lie living room until I> a.m..
and the entire household enjoyed waking
up at a more normal lime I spent most <if
ms davs at home, oi shopping with m\
mom. I onl\ went out to dinnei onee oi
twice. And instead ol ni\ usual e\t ilcd
sell. I was subdued. I sal around (|iiicil\,
with a small smile on m\ Lite.
M\ parents didn't know what was
happening and wondered il I wasn't
having a gootl ( hristmas. 1 hc\ worried
that tliev hadn't gotten inecxacih what
I w anted. What thc\ didn't reali/c is thai
lor the first lime. I soi i ol stopped t ,u ing
about what was within the wrapping
paper and noticed how mill h Inn it was
to just be at home. Sine, I still got into
pel I \ arguments wil h in\ siblings, and I
had to gel used to doing the dishes that
someone else alwavs did lot me ai
school. Kut lor oute, being slut kin ni\
hometown with lew Irientls didn't seem
so bad. Boredom, surprisingly. was a
welt onie feeling.
Yes, a lot ol noii max reali/e now that
(llu istmas is diHerein when vou're in t ol
lege. and most significant ol all might he
the tlisi oven that the inagnitudc and c\-
pense ol the presents vou receive don't
seem lo matter as ninth as the I act that
\ou have the opportunit\ to spend three
weeks with vour laniih doing basically
nolhing. A late thai seemed worse than
death when vou actualb lived al home
now seems comforting. \nd in the end, il
all (onics (lown to those moments. In two
weeks, you w ill (hopefully) have survived
a quarter of college. It doesn't mallei
whether it was your first or your filth. I he
light at tlu* end of the tunnel loi most of
\ou is that you get lo spend lime w nli peo
ple you love.
Merry ('.hristmas. Stanford students.
Knjov your holiday break.

So amid you tell that Sarah is ready to he wing
ing it hack to the East (.oast? Three weeks of

ments. She doesn'/ think there's anx wax it could
