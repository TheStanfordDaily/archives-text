Reactions to Thursday's protest
I here has been much misinformation
i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula
tions. In these instances, rules ol fairness,
honesty, and respect lor the rights of others
will govern our conduct at all times. Kxpe
diencA should never compromise integri
ty." Muse lolt\ c laims are ridiculously far
from the reality.
Indeed, Stanford needs to c hallenge its
own hypocrisy and ensure that all workers
on campus are treated lairlv, honestly, and
with res pec t with .1 li\ing wage, lull Ix'nefits
.lnd union protection. And until Stanford
recognizes the important e ol respec ting the
voice and the rights ol workers, we assure
you that this movement will not cease. We
urge the community to continue support
ing this issue until justice is won.

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan
lord I lospital ("Protesters' behavior
hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem
bers ol all these organizations, was to hold
Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
vices I.ou Saksen accountable to this com
munity, not necessarily to convince him
that subcontracting was unjust. The need
for such action was urgent. Saksen had re
peatedly demonstrated indifference to the
issue and planned, in I lie Daily's words,
"to sign a contract to outsource the posi
tions as soon as possible."
II the editors possess a distorted ac
count ot the events, they are probably not
alone. I lie Daily lot its part, contributed
to public misunderstanding bv framing
their (overage ol the event in a biased
manner. I he Daily does not a present a
students' account ol the events. It men
lions onl\ the students' opinion tli.it the\
were conscious ol patients and their view
of an incident that resulted in an injury
(two of the students, I will pedantically
point out, were not inside the hospital, as
the article claims). Students either were
not given a ( hance to respond to the accu
sation tli.it they "Ibrced their wa\ into the
administrative offices" and "became phys
ical with hospital personnel and verbally
abused them." or else tli.it response was
consigned to the journalistic dustbin.
Student accounts present a ver\ differ
ent picture from the one a reader would
glean from I lie Daily. I lie students en
tered peacefully and asked to meet with
Saksen. I hey waited for Saksen to con
clude <i meeting, during which time one ol
the students entered an adjacent physi
cians' lounge to inform them ol their pur
pose and | >l.in and added that they did not
wish to disturb them but that they were
welcome to join. When Saksen appeared,
the student spokesperson presented the
group's demand that he stop subconiract
ing, talk to the student delegation or ad
dress the protesters outside. Saksen re
fused to discuss the issue further with the
students and walked away.
1 lie students followed him until he en
tered not an ollice but a public lounge and
he c losed tlie dooi behind him. I lie sec u
rity guards then tried to physically remove
them. 1 he police, upon arrival, informed
security personnel that it was illegal lor the
guards to use physical tone to remove stu
dents without lit st dec laring a citizen's ar
rest. A citizen's arrest was then dec lared,
and the students were given the c hoice to
leave or be arrested. 1 hey chose the latter.
rhus, to continue to believe, as the edi
tors did, that the students were "forcing
their way intoan ollice . . . and making ex -
plic it demands." is to accept one version of
the events and to deny the validity of the
other. New, what all of us do agree upon is
that the students were arrested lor tres
passing, one of the most frequent disobe
dience techniques employed by non-vio
lent social movements. II the campaign to
end subcontlading is'extremist" tor tics
passing in order to impress upon Saksen
and the university administration the ur
gency of this issue, then so were the 54
protesters arrested for occupying Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ollice in order to
issue demands relating to multicultural
life at Stanford. Like Thursday's
protesters, these students had met with
administrative indifference, in this case,
loi years. II last week's protesters were
"out ol line," so were the 294 students that
were arrested lor refusing to leave Old
I'nion in 11 >77. in oiclei to protest Stan
lord's links to corporations invested in
apartheid South Africa. I ike the protest last
1 hursclav, this was part of a year-long ethi
cal ic >n and ac tivist campaign.
I he history ol activism suggests that
these ac lions, whic li the editors may deem
"neither appropriate nor consti uc live," arc
taken only alter other channels are exhaust
ed and the administration continually
proves to be negligent and non-cooperative.
1 )ue to I hursday's protest, the adminis
tration has agreed to arrange a meeting be
tween students antl 1 diversity President
|ohn Ilcnnessv, Provost |ohn Etcheineiidy
and Saksen on Wednesday. I he I Diversity
administration conceded this only after a
team ol student delegates negotiated with
ollicials tor several hours alter the six stu
dents at the hospital were arrested. I lowev
er, the meeting is closed, and as ol the writ
ing of this letter, the administration ictuses
to allow workers to attend, thus demon
strating further indillercncc towards this
issue. Saksen, in signing the agreement sub
conirac ting 10 housekeeping positions, has
taken a step towards a policy subcontract
ing that could ailed 440 positions without
adopting a living wage position.
There is, however, a '10-day escape
clause that can be utilized, but only it ad
min ist ration is pressured into changing its
stance. I'd like to repeat the community
leaders and organizers' joint letter
("Protest organizers justify actions, call lor
further support"): "the issues that we are
fighting for remain unaddrcssed." To all
those who have been inspired to the cause
of labor justice, I hope you work to effect
c hange with whatever non-violent means
you choose.

Reading Friday's Daily and the opin
ions section, I am struck by how the paper
is joining with the University in minimiz
ing the significance of the subcontracting

issue. I was also struck by the clear hi.is in
the opinions sec tion toward criticizing and
slandering the efforts of a protesting
group of students who believe in a cause.
The Daily printed two long and malicious
letters to the editor while tailing to print an
opinion In students strongly supporting
the cause.
Hy printing such long and hateful let
ters to the editor, taking up practically
one-third of the opinions page plus the ed
itorial. the paper is clearly not being a non
partisan participant in the dialogue.
I he Daily could have easily written an
otliei story more deeply outlining the
spec ilics about the subcontracting issue to
better inform the Stanford community
about what is going on in the hospital and
how that would ailed individual lives. I
also think The Daily could have given the
protesters more coverage in the paper.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
On tlw ex>ening oj Thursday, Nov. 2 I K I he
Daily's Opinions stuff laid out eveiy letter it re
ceived before 10 p.m. regarding the subcontract
ing issue and protest tluit afternoon. After that
point in time, a representative of the groups that or
ganized the protest contacted us /n telephone, re
questing that we extentl our Opinions deadline to
accomtxltite an addUumtd letter.
We com filled villi this request, printing the let
ter headlined "Protest organizers justify action,
call for further sufrfHrrt," and signed In leaders
and organizers from MEChA, PASU, SAAAC,
SCTJ, SEAS and SI AC.
1 would like to |k»ini out the bias in The
Daily 's article on the rally against subcon
tracting and the choice to sensationalize the
issue rather than focus on pertinent infor
mation. The structure of the news article it
self (I lospital / Administrative arguments,
the students' account, and then Hospital/
Administrative rebuttal) betrays this bias.
Furthermore, we did not "force our way"
into Saksen's office, we simply walked in. We
were Ibllc wing Saksen into a room, while he
walked away from us, when the door was
dosed on the student's arm. More impor
tantly, we all need to de-emphasize the sen
sationalist descriptions of what happened in
the hospital. It takes away from what's im
portant: the workers who will suffer from
sulxontracting and the decision makers
who can prevent it.
I lie ac cusations in the letters to the edi
tor .ire based purely on hearsay and partic
ular!) absurd. I am speaking of the letters
that was written by an undeclared fresh
man who has been on campus tor one
quarter and a sophomore who says that the
widely circulated e-mail I wrote represents
"modern media," whatever that means.
I hese letters were written even before 1 he
Daily came out, which means there was no
official or reliable source of information for
the events that occurred at all, only ru
mors. yet the authors still felt qualified to
write about the events as if they witnessed
the events personally.
This resulted in broad, nonsensical as
sumptions that have no support. I ac knowl
edge that inv e-mail, which was written in 15
minutes during the middle of the rally,
added to confusion, but it is no justification
lor ii rational, (insupportable judgements or
refusing to wait and line! out the tacts. For
instance, one letter assumes students were
arrested tor "breaking and entering," while
the other points towards "Ibrced entry."
For these reasons and many others, 1
found The Daily's coverage of the protest to
Ik- irresponsible. Hie contract has been
signed. Ten workers are earning poverty
wages, vet The Daily thinks that getting a
ti(ket lor trespassing, a common result ot
peaceful (ivil disobedience, is too extreme.
The Daily is simultaneously advocating
against an injustice and against doing some
thing "ellective" about it.
OWEN LI
ptnurr, Asuin-Anuruwn Slutltes
As the campaign against subcontracting
escalates, I believe it's essential that the Stan
lord community remain focused not only
on the issue at hand but also on its broader
implications.
As a coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Justice At Stanford, I am well
aware of the pattern of neglectful policies
the Stanford I lospital has directed at low -in
come communities of color. During SEAS's
Medical Waste ('.ampaign, students success
tully fought to stop the hospital from send
ing its dioxin-produt ing waste to an incin
erator in ()akland. A 1994 EPA report con
firmed that dioxin promotes cancer, can
cause severe reproductive and develop
mental problems, can damage the immune
system and can interfere with regulatory
hormones.
So I ask: why would a hospital of all places
knowingly contribute to dioxin production,
given the severe health threat that it poses?
Does cost minimization justify the exploita
tion of people and the environment? And is
it morally acceptable to exploit those who do
not even have the political clout to defend
themselves?
It was not until students voiced their
concerns that the hospital agreed to adopt
a safer method of medical waste disposal.

Now the hospital has signed a com rat t to
subcontract jobs, meaning lower wages,
fewer benefits and compromised sanita
tion at the hospital (due to (lit- inevitable
inexperience of lower paid, temporary
workers). Yet again, hospital administra
tors are avoiding accountability tor their
actions because there is no moral ground
to support their stance.
[list as the resit lent so! Oakland sought
help in their light to eliminate <li< >\m lie>m
their neighborhoods, workers now seek our
help to tight lor lair labor standards. I ea
gerly await the day when unjust policies will
not Ik- implemented in the lirst place. In the
meantime, we should speak out for the
rights of others, rights that have been de
nied in the name ol economic s.
Whether vour pretet red jargon is politi
cal, spiritual, philosophical or other, the
tcncts of t ivit dutv, compassion, just it e, and
basic human deccnc\ all boil down to one
thing: moral progress. ()urstx ietv could use
some. As students at a prestigious universi
ty, we have a powerful opportunit\ and a se
rious responsibility to bridge the gap be
tween decision-makers and the affected. We
can promote antl engage in meaningful ex
changes that will result in a more enlight
ened, unified and consensual six ietv.

1 am writing this letter in ordei It) ex
press ni\ ow 11 pet sonal outrage about the
occurrences t>l Ii itla\ antl lurthei more to
demantl the resignation ol Lou Saksen,
Stanford Hospital's \ it t* President of
General Services. I am not representing
any organization through ibis letter, but
my own views.
On I hursdav, six Stanford student
leaders were arrested loi peacefully
protesting an injustice: non-union, low
accountability, low wage, no-benelit sul>-
contrat ling that would allow the Stanford
I lospital to "t lean its hands" from part it i
pation in the exploitation ol predomi
nantly Black, Asian antl Latino workers.
We can not allow the I lospital nor the ad
ministration to pretend it has no respon
sibility in this matter. I liev do!
On Friday, more than 100 students
gathered around the hospital in ordei to
demantl a meeting with Saksen, who
presently lias the livelihood ol at least 10
workers in his hands. I hey sought the op
portunity as Stanford community mem
bers to express their views about his im
pending decision to begin the process of
non-union subcontracting, which toiild
potentially ailed I 10 nioie hospital work
ers and set a precedent not only at Stanford
but other universities to develop the same
unfair hiring prat (ires.
Light students entered the hospital and
after Saksen refused to meet with tlieni,
were accosted, harrassed antl forcefully re
moved by Lou Saksen's bouncers — unau
thorized layv enforcement officers. I he po
lite then had to free these students from
these bouncers before they could even ar
rest them. Six students were ai rested.
Afterwards, more than 150 students
gathered outside of the office of I niveisity
President |ohn I lennessy in order to de
mand the release of 'these six students and to
the end of non-union siibt out rat ting ai
Stanford. For yvhatevei reasons, we t lit I not
see I lennessy nor heai li< >\n hew as g< >iilg to
ileal witli this problem. Ii seems that per
haps he is not fully aware of what has ot
t lin ed today and what lias been happening
throughout this "Stop Subcontracting"
campaign.
In the past weeks, the members ol the
Stanford Labor Action C.oalition had
hoped to be able to come to a laii agree
ment com crning fair hii ing pt at tit rs with
Saksen. If not, they hoped to stop the mo
tion to begin sulx ontrai ling antl ai least in
volve more of the people directly affected
by it in the decision-making process. I his
has not happened, and wit I i the at lions In
Saksen and his bouncers, ii is clear that it
will not happen willi him in the seat ol
power, nor without a fairer sy stem of liu ing
at the Stanford 1 lospital.
One man should not have full decision
making poyver. Workers antl concerned
Stanford community nientbei s should have
a say. And if our voice yvill in>t be heard t >r re
spected through traditional means then
they must anil will be heart I thiough means
of our own devising.
Fvery individual who witnessed what oc
curred on Friday should and must at the
very least voice their opinion directly to
those who have poyver over this situation,
Saksen and Hennessy. Do not keep your
outrage or your opinions to yourself. Do not
depend on other students to voice your
opinion for you. It is an unfair burden that
they as students should not have to bear. I
have witnessed several extremely intelli
gent and talented individuals who have
been involved in this campaign from the
beginning deteriorate emotionally from
trying to battle the in justices that the I ni
versity — that they pay money to attend
— allows within itself. Ii is the responsi
bility of the University to allow us to be
students without the guilt that we arc
somehow participating antl perpetuating
a system of exploitation. Some students,
like myself I must admit, can at times ig
nore this fact. Others, like those involved
in this campaign, cannot, antl their aca
demic performance and motivation have

suffered.
I hold 11 it* Stanford administration re
sponsible lot this and demand that mea
sures be taken to change this. We can
begin by establishing fail hiring practices
at the University that do not depend tin
the exploitation ol people of color and
workers unable or afraid to unionize as a
result of this system of subcontracting.

"Going about it the wrong yvay." 1 his
is more than the sentiments expressed in
Friday's editorial, regarding the student
protest against unfair labor practices, it
seems to be the buz/ phrase going
around campus.
| unit>r Monica I letiesiioza tloyvnplaved
the sensationalism ol the event in her quote
yesterday to I lie Daily. I lie editorial
11 limed in: "If the protesters' pin pose was to
gain attention, they succeeded." Well,
amen. I hey can talk about the issues antl
the fundamentals antl the cornet stones anil
precedents of their actions yesterday, but
the whole scenario sinkcs me as the most
sexy, scandalous, sensational action on this
campus in years. May be decades. Bravo.
I he danger, of course, is not being able
to eflect positive change as a result of sensa
tional action. But I think positive change
was elici ted. I low many of lis gave a damn
about laboi sulx'ontractiug before yester
day ? Antl even though niosi of us still don't
give a damn enough to do anything materi
al, at least we can lend our opinion one yvay
or llii' other. A little row now and again
serves us to realize the liu I that we live in a
yvorltlol just ices and injustices, antl that hay
ing a slant! is pei haps more human than not
hay ing one al all.
So, I commend yesterday's protesters.
Don't be lools: the hospital is still going to
subcontract. Thank you, though, lor hav
ing the temerity to challenge authority,
break the law antl inconvenience your
selves lor a cause. I think the I niversitv is
ultimately better for it.

i am not sure yvhat was more illustrative,
the events of Thursday at the medical (en
ter, or the response as represented by the
letters and editorial of I lie Daily on Friday.
What is it illustrative of? It is yet another
event litre al Stanford that punt tuates the
lad that most ol the students here would
like to picture themselves as the tut in e bro
kers ol power and those that would be in a
position of authority , anil as such have a
built in ability antl tendency to empathize
with that perspective.
Fo condemn a brave young woman,
who had the determination to attempt to
get Stanford to enforce a more responsi
ble labor polity , is the product of an ex
pet lation that we .is Stan fort I students will
be in positions to broker power and in po
sitions of authority. We as students are
quit k to empathize with those already in
poyver for reasons that the readers can
hash out on their own.
May junior Monica llenestroza be
blessed forever lot attempting lo help real
people, yvith real families, who are dealing
with the real ellects ol the rising costs ol liv
ing. May she be blessed foi knowingly or un
knowinglv sacrificing her dean criminal
record and her arm for these real people.
May she be blessed for not forgetting that
though it may not have been tlieii intention,
the ultimate result of people yvho sullered
and died for us is that students like us could
live privileged lives and be here at Stanford.
Mav we iecognize the intelligent eol a sacri
fice that brought the issue to the lore here at
Stanford.
\IV\M IM I I 1 t.KIN
Junior. Ilislory is lliolog\
I here is a very basic concept, essen
tial to the practice of democracy antl the
protection of our t ivil liberties, called
civil disobedience. Imagine, fora mo
ment, where our country would be
without the actions and events that took
place flut ing the civil rights movement.
The scenarios are somewhat different,
but the similarities are what is impor
tant here. What would the letters to the
editor say, looking back on history in
those cases.
From what I understand, the issues that
are at the heart of this matter arc long-stand
ingones. Dialogue (at the very least attempts
at it) and educational dibits have been at
tempted by the very organizers who were
recently arrested and the groups to which
they belong. I hose hospital officials who at e
making the decisions are certainly entitled
to ilo so, in accordance with their own lx--
liels, but would it hurt lot there to be some
greater examination "of the lints?" Would a
multi-liltetcd locus group, whose purpose
would lx' to examine relevant issues in all
lights, be a bad thing?
Perhaps the students who were arrested
made some mistakes in the physical vehe
ment e with which they protested. Mob rule
should not lx- allowed to lx- a controlling
force, but I do not think that this is the most
important element tollix i discussed here. ll'

we continue to allow 11 u * l<x ,il point of our
public dist ourse to fx-then mistakes, then I
believe that we have fallen prex lo 0111 own
ignorant e 01 loll\.
I'm inclined to believe tli.it main ol us

Reactions to Thursday's protest
I here has been much misinformation
i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula
tions. In these instances, rules ol fairness,
honesty, and respect lor the rights of others
will govern our conduct at all times. Kxpe
diencA should never compromise integri
ty." Muse lolt\ c laims are ridiculously far
from the reality.
Indeed, Stanford needs to c hallenge its
own hypocrisy and ensure that all workers
on campus are treated lairlv, honestly, and
with res pec t with .1 li\ing wage, lull Ix'nefits
.lnd union protection. And until Stanford
recognizes the important e ol respec ting the
voice and the rights ol workers, we assure
you that this movement will not cease. We
urge the community to continue support
ing this issue until justice is won.

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan
lord I lospital ("Protesters' behavior
hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem
bers ol all these organizations, was to hold
Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
vices I.ou Saksen accountable to this com
munity, not necessarily to convince him
that subcontracting was unjust. The need
for such action was urgent. Saksen had re
peatedly demonstrated indifference to the
issue and planned, in I lie Daily's words,
"to sign a contract to outsource the posi
tions as soon as possible."
II the editors possess a distorted ac
count ot the events, they are probably not
alone. I lie Daily lot its part, contributed
to public misunderstanding bv framing
their (overage ol the event in a biased
manner. I he Daily does not a present a
students' account ol the events. It men
lions onl\ the students' opinion tli.it the\
were conscious ol patients and their view
of an incident that resulted in an injury
(two of the students, I will pedantically
point out, were not inside the hospital, as
the article claims). Students either were
not given a ( hance to respond to the accu
sation tli.it they "Ibrced their wa\ into the
administrative offices" and "became phys
ical with hospital personnel and verbally
abused them." or else tli.it response was
consigned to the journalistic dustbin.
Student accounts present a ver\ differ
ent picture from the one a reader would
glean from I lie Daily. I lie students en
tered peacefully and asked to meet with
Saksen. I hey waited for Saksen to con
clude <i meeting, during which time one ol
the students entered an adjacent physi
cians' lounge to inform them ol their pur
pose and | >l.in and added that they did not
wish to disturb them but that they were
welcome to join. When Saksen appeared,
the student spokesperson presented the
group's demand that he stop subconiract
ing, talk to the student delegation or ad
dress the protesters outside. Saksen re
fused to discuss the issue further with the
students and walked away.
1 lie students followed him until he en
tered not an ollice but a public lounge and
he c losed tlie dooi behind him. I lie sec u
rity guards then tried to physically remove
them. 1 he police, upon arrival, informed
security personnel that it was illegal lor the
guards to use physical tone to remove stu
dents without lit st dec laring a citizen's ar
rest. A citizen's arrest was then dec lared,
and the students were given the c hoice to
leave or be arrested. 1 hey chose the latter.
rhus, to continue to believe, as the edi
tors did, that the students were "forcing
their way intoan ollice . . . and making ex -
plic it demands." is to accept one version of
the events and to deny the validity of the
other. New, what all of us do agree upon is
that the students were arrested lor tres
passing, one of the most frequent disobe
dience techniques employed by non-vio
lent social movements. II the campaign to
end subcontlading is'extremist" tor tics
passing in order to impress upon Saksen
and the university administration the ur
gency of this issue, then so were the 54
protesters arrested for occupying Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ollice in order to
issue demands relating to multicultural
life at Stanford. Like Thursday's
protesters, these students had met with
administrative indifference, in this case,
loi years. II last week's protesters were
"out ol line," so were the 294 students that
were arrested lor refusing to leave Old
I'nion in 11 >77. in oiclei to protest Stan
lord's links to corporations invested in
apartheid South Africa. I ike the protest last
1 hursclav, this was part of a year-long ethi
cal ic >n and ac tivist campaign.
I he history ol activism suggests that
these ac lions, whic li the editors may deem
"neither appropriate nor consti uc live," arc
taken only alter other channels are exhaust
ed and the administration continually
proves to be negligent and non-cooperative.
1 )ue to I hursday's protest, the adminis
tration has agreed to arrange a meeting be
tween students antl 1 diversity President
|ohn Ilcnnessv, Provost |ohn Etcheineiidy
and Saksen on Wednesday. I he I Diversity
administration conceded this only after a
team ol student delegates negotiated with
ollicials tor several hours alter the six stu
dents at the hospital were arrested. I lowev
er, the meeting is closed, and as ol the writ
ing of this letter, the administration ictuses
to allow workers to attend, thus demon
strating further indillercncc towards this
issue. Saksen, in signing the agreement sub
conirac ting 10 housekeeping positions, has
taken a step towards a policy subcontract
ing that could ailed 440 positions without
adopting a living wage position.
There is, however, a '10-day escape
clause that can be utilized, but only it ad
min ist ration is pressured into changing its
stance. I'd like to repeat the community
leaders and organizers' joint letter
("Protest organizers justify actions, call lor
further support"): "the issues that we are
fighting for remain unaddrcssed." To all
those who have been inspired to the cause
of labor justice, I hope you work to effect
c hange with whatever non-violent means
you choose.

Reading Friday's Daily and the opin
ions section, I am struck by how the paper
is joining with the University in minimiz
ing the significance of the subcontracting

issue. I was also struck by the clear hi.is in
the opinions sec tion toward criticizing and
slandering the efforts of a protesting
group of students who believe in a cause.
The Daily printed two long and malicious
letters to the editor while tailing to print an
opinion In students strongly supporting
the cause.
Hy printing such long and hateful let
ters to the editor, taking up practically
one-third of the opinions page plus the ed
itorial. the paper is clearly not being a non
partisan participant in the dialogue.
I he Daily could have easily written an
otliei story more deeply outlining the
spec ilics about the subcontracting issue to
better inform the Stanford community
about what is going on in the hospital and
how that would ailed individual lives. I
also think The Daily could have given the
protesters more coverage in the paper.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
On tlw ex>ening oj Thursday, Nov. 2 I K I he
Daily's Opinions stuff laid out eveiy letter it re
ceived before 10 p.m. regarding the subcontract
ing issue and protest tluit afternoon. After that
point in time, a representative of the groups that or
ganized the protest contacted us /n telephone, re
questing that we extentl our Opinions deadline to
accomtxltite an addUumtd letter.
We com filled villi this request, printing the let
ter headlined "Protest organizers justify action,
call for further sufrfHrrt," and signed In leaders
and organizers from MEChA, PASU, SAAAC,
SCTJ, SEAS and SI AC.
1 would like to |k»ini out the bias in The
Daily 's article on the rally against subcon
tracting and the choice to sensationalize the
issue rather than focus on pertinent infor
mation. The structure of the news article it
self (I lospital / Administrative arguments,
the students' account, and then Hospital/
Administrative rebuttal) betrays this bias.
Furthermore, we did not "force our way"
into Saksen's office, we simply walked in. We
were Ibllc wing Saksen into a room, while he
walked away from us, when the door was
dosed on the student's arm. More impor
tantly, we all need to de-emphasize the sen
sationalist descriptions of what happened in
the hospital. It takes away from what's im
portant: the workers who will suffer from
sulxontracting and the decision makers
who can prevent it.
I lie ac cusations in the letters to the edi
tor .ire based purely on hearsay and partic
ular!) absurd. I am speaking of the letters
that was written by an undeclared fresh
man who has been on campus tor one
quarter and a sophomore who says that the
widely circulated e-mail I wrote represents
"modern media," whatever that means.
I hese letters were written even before 1 he
Daily came out, which means there was no
official or reliable source of information for
the events that occurred at all, only ru
mors. yet the authors still felt qualified to
write about the events as if they witnessed
the events personally.
This resulted in broad, nonsensical as
sumptions that have no support. I ac knowl
edge that inv e-mail, which was written in 15
minutes during the middle of the rally,
added to confusion, but it is no justification
lor ii rational, (insupportable judgements or
refusing to wait and line! out the tacts. For
instance, one letter assumes students were
arrested tor "breaking and entering," while
the other points towards "Ibrced entry."
For these reasons and many others, 1
found The Daily's coverage of the protest to
Ik- irresponsible. Hie contract has been
signed. Ten workers are earning poverty
wages, vet The Daily thinks that getting a
ti(ket lor trespassing, a common result ot
peaceful (ivil disobedience, is too extreme.
The Daily is simultaneously advocating
against an injustice and against doing some
thing "ellective" about it.
OWEN LI
ptnurr, Asuin-Anuruwn Slutltes
As the campaign against subcontracting
escalates, I believe it's essential that the Stan
lord community remain focused not only
on the issue at hand but also on its broader
implications.
As a coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Justice At Stanford, I am well
aware of the pattern of neglectful policies
the Stanford I lospital has directed at low -in
come communities of color. During SEAS's
Medical Waste ('.ampaign, students success
tully fought to stop the hospital from send
ing its dioxin-produt ing waste to an incin
erator in ()akland. A 1994 EPA report con
firmed that dioxin promotes cancer, can
cause severe reproductive and develop
mental problems, can damage the immune
system and can interfere with regulatory
hormones.
So I ask: why would a hospital of all places
knowingly contribute to dioxin production,
given the severe health threat that it poses?
Does cost minimization justify the exploita
tion of people and the environment? And is
it morally acceptable to exploit those who do
not even have the political clout to defend
themselves?
It was not until students voiced their
concerns that the hospital agreed to adopt
a safer method of medical waste disposal.

Now the hospital has signed a com rat t to
subcontract jobs, meaning lower wages,
fewer benefits and compromised sanita
tion at the hospital (due to (lit- inevitable
inexperience of lower paid, temporary
workers). Yet again, hospital administra
tors are avoiding accountability tor their
actions because there is no moral ground
to support their stance.
[list as the resit lent so! Oakland sought
help in their light to eliminate <li< >\m lie>m
their neighborhoods, workers now seek our
help to tight lor lair labor standards. I ea
gerly await the day when unjust policies will
not Ik- implemented in the lirst place. In the
meantime, we should speak out for the
rights of others, rights that have been de
nied in the name ol economic s.
Whether vour pretet red jargon is politi
cal, spiritual, philosophical or other, the
tcncts of t ivit dutv, compassion, just it e, and
basic human deccnc\ all boil down to one
thing: moral progress. ()urstx ietv could use
some. As students at a prestigious universi
ty, we have a powerful opportunit\ and a se
rious responsibility to bridge the gap be
tween decision-makers and the affected. We
can promote antl engage in meaningful ex
changes that will result in a more enlight
ened, unified and consensual six ietv.

1 am writing this letter in ordei It) ex
press ni\ ow 11 pet sonal outrage about the
occurrences t>l Ii itla\ antl lurthei more to
demantl the resignation ol Lou Saksen,
Stanford Hospital's \ it t* President of
General Services. I am not representing
any organization through ibis letter, but
my own views.
On I hursdav, six Stanford student
leaders were arrested loi peacefully
protesting an injustice: non-union, low
accountability, low wage, no-benelit sul>-
contrat ling that would allow the Stanford
I lospital to "t lean its hands" from part it i
pation in the exploitation ol predomi
nantly Black, Asian antl Latino workers.
We can not allow the I lospital nor the ad
ministration to pretend it has no respon
sibility in this matter. I liev do!
On Friday, more than 100 students
gathered around the hospital in ordei to
demantl a meeting with Saksen, who
presently lias the livelihood ol at least 10
workers in his hands. I hey sought the op
portunity as Stanford community mem
bers to express their views about his im
pending decision to begin the process of
non-union subcontracting, which toiild
potentially ailed I 10 nioie hospital work
ers and set a precedent not only at Stanford
but other universities to develop the same
unfair hiring prat (ires.
Light students entered the hospital and
after Saksen refused to meet with tlieni,
were accosted, harrassed antl forcefully re
moved by Lou Saksen's bouncers — unau
thorized layv enforcement officers. I he po
lite then had to free these students from
these bouncers before they could even ar
rest them. Six students were ai rested.
Afterwards, more than 150 students
gathered outside of the office of I niveisity
President |ohn I lennessy in order to de
mand the release of 'these six students and to
the end of non-union siibt out rat ting ai
Stanford. For yvhatevei reasons, we t lit I not
see I lennessy nor heai li< >\n hew as g< >iilg to
ileal witli this problem. Ii seems that per
haps he is not fully aware of what has ot
t lin ed today and what lias been happening
throughout this "Stop Subcontracting"
campaign.
In the past weeks, the members ol the
Stanford Labor Action C.oalition had
hoped to be able to come to a laii agree
ment com crning fair hii ing pt at tit rs with
Saksen. If not, they hoped to stop the mo
tion to begin sulx ontrai ling antl ai least in
volve more of the people directly affected
by it in the decision-making process. I his
has not happened, and wit I i the at lions In
Saksen and his bouncers, ii is clear that it
will not happen willi him in the seat ol
power, nor without a fairer sy stem of liu ing
at the Stanford 1 lospital.
One man should not have full decision
making poyver. Workers antl concerned
Stanford community nientbei s should have
a say. And if our voice yvill in>t be heard t >r re
spected through traditional means then
they must anil will be heart I thiough means
of our own devising.
Fvery individual who witnessed what oc
curred on Friday should and must at the
very least voice their opinion directly to
those who have poyver over this situation,
Saksen and Hennessy. Do not keep your
outrage or your opinions to yourself. Do not
depend on other students to voice your
opinion for you. It is an unfair burden that
they as students should not have to bear. I
have witnessed several extremely intelli
gent and talented individuals who have
been involved in this campaign from the
beginning deteriorate emotionally from
trying to battle the in justices that the I ni
versity — that they pay money to attend
— allows within itself. Ii is the responsi
bility of the University to allow us to be
students without the guilt that we arc
somehow participating antl perpetuating
a system of exploitation. Some students,
like myself I must admit, can at times ig
nore this fact. Others, like those involved
in this campaign, cannot, antl their aca
demic performance and motivation have

suffered.
I hold 11 it* Stanford administration re
sponsible lot this and demand that mea
sures be taken to change this. We can
begin by establishing fail hiring practices
at the University that do not depend tin
the exploitation ol people of color and
workers unable or afraid to unionize as a
result of this system of subcontracting.

"Going about it the wrong yvay." 1 his
is more than the sentiments expressed in
Friday's editorial, regarding the student
protest against unfair labor practices, it
seems to be the buz/ phrase going
around campus.
| unit>r Monica I letiesiioza tloyvnplaved
the sensationalism ol the event in her quote
yesterday to I lie Daily. I lie editorial
11 limed in: "If the protesters' pin pose was to
gain attention, they succeeded." Well,
amen. I hey can talk about the issues antl
the fundamentals antl the cornet stones anil
precedents of their actions yesterday, but
the whole scenario sinkcs me as the most
sexy, scandalous, sensational action on this
campus in years. May be decades. Bravo.
I he danger, of course, is not being able
to eflect positive change as a result of sensa
tional action. But I think positive change
was elici ted. I low many of lis gave a damn
about laboi sulx'ontractiug before yester
day ? Antl even though niosi of us still don't
give a damn enough to do anything materi
al, at least we can lend our opinion one yvay
or llii' other. A little row now and again
serves us to realize the liu I that we live in a
yvorltlol just ices and injustices, antl that hay
ing a slant! is pei haps more human than not
hay ing one al all.
So, I commend yesterday's protesters.
Don't be lools: the hospital is still going to
subcontract. Thank you, though, lor hav
ing the temerity to challenge authority,
break the law antl inconvenience your
selves lor a cause. I think the I niversitv is
ultimately better for it.

i am not sure yvhat was more illustrative,
the events of Thursday at the medical (en
ter, or the response as represented by the
letters and editorial of I lie Daily on Friday.
What is it illustrative of? It is yet another
event litre al Stanford that punt tuates the
lad that most ol the students here would
like to picture themselves as the tut in e bro
kers ol power and those that would be in a
position of authority , anil as such have a
built in ability antl tendency to empathize
with that perspective.
Fo condemn a brave young woman,
who had the determination to attempt to
get Stanford to enforce a more responsi
ble labor polity , is the product of an ex
pet lation that we .is Stan fort I students will
be in positions to broker power and in po
sitions of authority. We as students are
quit k to empathize with those already in
poyver for reasons that the readers can
hash out on their own.
May junior Monica llenestroza be
blessed forever lot attempting lo help real
people, yvith real families, who are dealing
with the real ellects ol the rising costs ol liv
ing. May she be blessed foi knowingly or un
knowinglv sacrificing her dean criminal
record and her arm for these real people.
May she be blessed for not forgetting that
though it may not have been tlieii intention,
the ultimate result of people yvho sullered
and died for us is that students like us could
live privileged lives and be here at Stanford.
Mav we iecognize the intelligent eol a sacri

\IV\M IM I I 1 t.KIN
Junior. Ilislory is lliolog\
I here is a very basic concept, essen
tial to the practice of democracy antl the
protection of our t ivil liberties, called
civil disobedience. Imagine, fora mo
ment, where our country would be
without the actions and events that took
place flut ing the civil rights movement.
The scenarios are somewhat different,
but the similarities are what is impor
tant here. What would the letters to the
editor say, looking back on history in
those cases.
From what I understand, the issues that
are at the heart of this matter arc long-stand
ingones. Dialogue (at the very least attempts
at it) and educational dibits have been at
tempted by the very organizers who were
recently arrested and the groups to which
they belong. I hose hospital officials who at e
making the decisions are certainly entitled
to ilo so, in accordance with their own lx--
liels, but would it hurt lot there to be some
greater examination "of the lints?" Would a
multi-liltetcd locus group, whose purpose
would lx' to examine relevant issues in all
lights, be a bad thing?
Perhaps the students who were arrested
made some mistakes in the physical vehe
ment e with which they protested. Mob rule
should not lx- allowed to lx- a controlling
force, but I do not think that this is the most
important element tollix i discussed here. ll'

we continue to allow 11 u * l<x ,il point of our
public dist ourse to fx-then mistakes, then I
believe that we have fallen prex lo 0111 own
ignorant e 01 loll\.
I'm inclined to believe tli.it main ol us
did not examine (he information tli.it these

(well belot e the protest o< < m red). I be in

those idealisti( protesting groups. Perhaps
we were 100 bus\ with job interviews and
end-of-terin projects, oi max be (just m«i\ 1 k-)
soineol us pist didn't agree.
Perhaps x\e shouldn't be content to let
history repeat it.sell here. I .el's turn this
negative attention into .in opportunity lo

Reactions to Thursday's protest
I here has been much misinformation
i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula
tions. In these instances, rules ol fairness,
honesty, and respect lor the rights of others
will govern our conduct at all times. Kxpe
diencA should never compromise integri
ty." Muse lolt\ c laims are ridiculously far
from the reality.
Indeed, Stanford needs to c hallenge its
own hypocrisy and ensure that all workers
on campus are treated lairlv, honestly, and
with res pec t with .1 li\ing wage, lull Ix'nefits
.lnd union protection. And until Stanford
recognizes the important e ol respec ting the
voice and the rights ol workers, we assure
you that this movement will not cease. We
urge the community to continue support
ing this issue until justice is won.

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan
lord I lospital ("Protesters' behavior
hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem
bers ol all these organizations, was to hold
Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
vices I.ou Saksen accountable to this com
munity, not necessarily to convince him
that subcontracting was unjust. The need
for such action was urgent. Saksen had re
peatedly demonstrated indifference to the
issue and planned, in I lie Daily's words,
"to sign a contract to outsource the posi
tions as soon as possible."
II the editors possess a distorted ac
count ot the events, they are probably not
alone. I lie Daily lot its part, contributed
to public misunderstanding bv framing
their (overage ol the event in a biased
manner. I he Daily does not a present a
students' account ol the events. It men
lions onl\ the students' opinion tli.it the\
were conscious ol patients and their view
of an incident that resulted in an injury
(two of the students, I will pedantically
point out, were not inside the hospital, as
the article claims). Students either were
not given a ( hance to respond to the accu
sation tli.it they "Ibrced their wa\ into the
administrative offices" and "became phys
ical with hospital personnel and verbally
abused them." or else tli.it response was
consigned to the journalistic dustbin.
Student accounts present a ver\ differ
ent picture from the one a reader would
glean from I lie Daily. I lie students en
tered peacefully and asked to meet with
Saksen. I hey waited for Saksen to con
clude <i meeting, during which time one ol
the students entered an adjacent physi
cians' lounge to inform them ol their pur
pose and | >l.in and added that they did not
wish to disturb them but that they were
welcome to join. When Saksen appeared,
the student spokesperson presented the
group's demand that he stop subconiract
ing, talk to the student delegation or ad
dress the protesters outside. Saksen re
fused to discuss the issue further with the
students and walked away.
1 lie students followed him until he en
tered not an ollice but a public lounge and
he c losed tlie dooi behind him. I lie sec u
rity guards then tried to physically remove
them. 1 he police, upon arrival, informed
security personnel that it was illegal lor the
guards to use physical tone to remove stu
dents without lit st dec laring a citizen's ar
rest. A citizen's arrest was then dec lared,
and the students were given the c hoice to
leave or be arrested. 1 hey chose the latter.
rhus, to continue to believe, as the edi
tors did, that the students were "forcing
their way intoan ollice . . . and making ex -
plic it demands." is to accept one version of
the events and to deny the validity of the
other. New, what all of us do agree upon is
that the students were arrested lor tres
passing, one of the most frequent disobe
dience techniques employed by non-vio
lent social movements. II the campaign to
end subcontlading is'extremist" tor tics
passing in order to impress upon Saksen
and the university administration the ur
gency of this issue, then so were the 54
protesters arrested for occupying Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ollice in order to
issue demands relating to multicultural
life at Stanford. Like Thursday's
protesters, these students had met with
administrative indifference, in this case,
loi years. II last week's protesters were
"out ol line," so were the 294 students that
were arrested lor refusing to leave Old
I'nion in 11 >77. in oiclei to protest Stan
lord's links to corporations invested in
apartheid South Africa. I ike the protest last
1 hursclav, this was part of a year-long ethi
cal ic >n and ac tivist campaign.
I he history ol activism suggests that
these ac lions, whic li the editors may deem
"neither appropriate nor consti uc live," arc
taken only alter other channels are exhaust
ed and the administration continually
proves to be negligent and non-cooperative.
1 )ue to I hursday's protest, the adminis
tration has agreed to arrange a meeting be
tween students antl 1 diversity President
|ohn Ilcnnessv, Provost |ohn Etcheineiidy
and Saksen on Wednesday. I he I Diversity
administration conceded this only after a
team ol student delegates negotiated with
ollicials tor several hours alter the six stu
dents at the hospital were arrested. I lowev
er, the meeting is closed, and as ol the writ
ing of this letter, the administration ictuses
to allow workers to attend, thus demon
strating further indillercncc towards this
issue. Saksen, in signing the agreement sub
conirac ting 10 housekeeping positions, has
taken a step towards a policy subcontract
ing that could ailed 440 positions without
adopting a living wage position.
There is, however, a '10-day escape
clause that can be utilized, but only it ad
min ist ration is pressured into changing its
stance. I'd like to repeat the community
leaders and organizers' joint letter
("Protest organizers justify actions, call lor
further support"): "the issues that we are
fighting for remain unaddrcssed." To all
those who have been inspired to the cause
of labor justice, I hope you work to effect
c hange with whatever non-violent means
you choose.

Reading Friday's Daily and the opin
ions section, I am struck by how the paper
is joining with the University in minimiz
ing the significance of the subcontracting

issue. I was also struck by the clear hi.is in
the opinions sec tion toward criticizing and
slandering the efforts of a protesting
group of students who believe in a cause.
The Daily printed two long and malicious
letters to the editor while tailing to print an
opinion In students strongly supporting
the cause.
Hy printing such long and hateful let
ters to the editor, taking up practically
one-third of the opinions page plus the ed
itorial. the paper is clearly not being a non
partisan participant in the dialogue.
I he Daily could have easily written an
otliei story more deeply outlining the
spec ilics about the subcontracting issue to
better inform the Stanford community
about what is going on in the hospital and
how that would ailed individual lives. I
also think The Daily could have given the
protesters more coverage in the paper.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
On tlw ex>ening oj Thursday, Nov. 2 I K I he
Daily's Opinions stuff laid out eveiy letter it re
ceived before 10 p.m. regarding the subcontract
ing issue and protest tluit afternoon. After that
point in time, a representative of the groups that or
ganized the protest contacted us /n telephone, re
questing that we extentl our Opinions deadline to
accomtxltite an addUumtd letter.
We com filled villi this request, printing the let
ter headlined "Protest organizers justify action,
call for further sufrfHrrt," and signed In leaders
and organizers from MEChA, PASU, SAAAC,
SCTJ, SEAS and SI AC.
1 would like to |k»ini out the bias in The
Daily 's article on the rally against subcon
tracting and the choice to sensationalize the
issue rather than focus on pertinent infor
mation. The structure of the news article it
self (I lospital / Administrative arguments,
the students' account, and then Hospital/
Administrative rebuttal) betrays this bias.
Furthermore, we did not "force our way"
into Saksen's office, we simply walked in. We
were Ibllc wing Saksen into a room, while he
walked away from us, when the door was
dosed on the student's arm. More impor
tantly, we all need to de-emphasize the sen
sationalist descriptions of what happened in
the hospital. It takes away from what's im
portant: the workers who will suffer from
sulxontracting and the decision makers
who can prevent it.
I lie ac cusations in the letters to the edi
tor .ire based purely on hearsay and partic
ular!) absurd. I am speaking of the letters
that was written by an undeclared fresh
man who has been on campus tor one
quarter and a sophomore who says that the
widely circulated e-mail I wrote represents
"modern media," whatever that means.
I hese letters were written even before 1 he
Daily came out, which means there was no
official or reliable source of information for
the events that occurred at all, only ru
mors. yet the authors still felt qualified to
write about the events as if they witnessed
the events personally.
This resulted in broad, nonsensical as
sumptions that have no support. I ac knowl
edge that inv e-mail, which was written in 15
minutes during the middle of the rally,
added to confusion, but it is no justification
lor ii rational, (insupportable judgements or
refusing to wait and line! out the tacts. For
instance, one letter assumes students were
arrested tor "breaking and entering," while
the other points towards "Ibrced entry."
For these reasons and many others, 1
found The Daily's coverage of the protest to
Ik- irresponsible. Hie contract has been
signed. Ten workers are earning poverty
wages, vet The Daily thinks that getting a
ti(ket lor trespassing, a common result ot
peaceful (ivil disobedience, is too extreme.
The Daily is simultaneously advocating
against an injustice and against doing some
thing "ellective" about it.

As the campaign against subcontracting
escalates, I believe it's essential that the Stan
lord community remain focused not only
on the issue at hand but also on its broader
implications.
As a coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Justice At Stanford, I am well
aware of the pattern of neglectful policies
the Stanford I lospital has directed at low -in
come communities of color. During SEAS's
Medical Waste ('.ampaign, students success
tully fought to stop the hospital from send
ing its dioxin-produt ing waste to an incin
erator in ()akland. A 1994 EPA report con
firmed that dioxin promotes cancer, can
cause severe reproductive and develop
mental problems, can damage the immune
system and can interfere with regulatory
hormones.
So I ask: why would a hospital of all places
knowingly contribute to dioxin production,
given the severe health threat that it poses?
Does cost minimization justify the exploita
tion of people and the environment? And is
it morally acceptable to exploit those who do
not even have the political clout to defend
themselves?
It was not until students voiced their
concerns that the hospital agreed to adopt
a safer method of medical waste disposal.

Now the hospital has signed a com rat t to
subcontract jobs, meaning lower wages,
fewer benefits and compromised sanita
tion at the hospital (due to (lit- inevitable
inexperience of lower paid, temporary
workers). Yet again, hospital administra
tors are avoiding accountability tor their
actions because there is no moral ground
to support their stance.
[list as the resit lent so! Oakland sought
help in their light to eliminate <li< >\m lie>m
their neighborhoods, workers now seek our
help to tight lor lair labor standards. I ea
gerly await the day when unjust policies will
not Ik- implemented in the lirst place. In the
meantime, we should speak out for the
rights of others, rights that have been de
nied in the name ol economic s.
Whether vour pretet red jargon is politi
cal, spiritual, philosophical or other, the
tcncts of t ivit dutv, compassion, just it e, and
basic human deccnc\ all boil down to one
thing: moral progress. ()urstx ietv could use
some. As students at a prestigious universi
ty, we have a powerful opportunit\ and a se
rious responsibility to bridge the gap be
tween decision-makers and the affected. We
can promote antl engage in meaningful ex
changes that will result in a more enlight
ened, unified and consensual six ietv.

1 am writing this letter in ordei It) ex
press ni\ ow 11 pet sonal outrage about the
occurrences t>l Ii itla\ antl lurthei more to
demantl the resignation ol Lou Saksen,
Stanford Hospital's \ it t* President of
General Services. I am not representing
any organization through ibis letter, but
my own views.
On I hursdav, six Stanford student
leaders were arrested loi peacefully
protesting an injustice: non-union, low
accountability, low wage, no-benelit sul>-
contrat ling that would allow the Stanford
I lospital to "t lean its hands" from part it i
pation in the exploitation ol predomi
nantly Black, Asian antl Latino workers.
We can not allow the I lospital nor the ad
ministration to pretend it has no respon
sibility in this matter. I liev do!
On Friday, more than 100 students
gathered around the hospital in ordei to
demantl a meeting with Saksen, who
presently lias the livelihood ol at least 10
workers in his hands. I hey sought the op
portunity as Stanford community mem
bers to express their views about his im
pending decision to begin the process of
non-union subcontracting, which toiild
potentially ailed I 10 nioie hospital work
ers and set a precedent not only at Stanford
but other universities to develop the same
unfair hiring prat (ires.
Light students entered the hospital and
after Saksen refused to meet with tlieni,
were accosted, harrassed antl forcefully re
moved by Lou Saksen's bouncers — unau
thorized layv enforcement officers. I he po
lite then had to free these students from
these bouncers before they could even ar
rest them. Six students were ai rested.
Afterwards, more than 150 students
gathered outside of the office of I niveisity
President |ohn I lennessy in order to de
mand the release of 'these six students and to
the end of non-union siibt out rat ting ai
Stanford. For yvhatevei reasons, we t lit I not
see I lennessy nor heai li< >\n hew as g< >iilg to
ileal witli this problem. Ii seems that per
haps he is not fully aware of what has ot
t lin ed today and what lias been happening
throughout this "Stop Subcontracting"
campaign.
In the past weeks, the members ol the
Stanford Labor Action C.oalition had
hoped to be able to come to a laii agree
ment com crning fair hii ing pt at tit rs with
Saksen. If not, they hoped to stop the mo
tion to begin sulx ontrai ling antl ai least in
volve more of the people directly affected
by it in the decision-making process. I his
has not happened, and wit I i the at lions In
Saksen and his bouncers, ii is clear that it
will not happen willi him in the seat ol
power, nor without a fairer sy stem of liu ing
at the Stanford 1 lospital.
One man should not have full decision
making poyver. Workers antl concerned
Stanford community nientbei s should have
a say. And if our voice yvill in>t be heard t >r re
spected through traditional means then
they must anil will be heart I thiough means
of our own devising.
Fvery individual who witnessed what oc
curred on Friday should and must at the
very least voice their opinion directly to
those who have poyver over this situation,
Saksen and Hennessy. Do not keep your
outrage or your opinions to yourself. Do not
depend on other students to voice your
opinion for you. It is an unfair burden that
they as students should not have to bear. I
have witnessed several extremely intelli
gent and talented individuals who have
been involved in this campaign from the
beginning deteriorate emotionally from
trying to battle the in justices that the I ni
versity — that they pay money to attend
— allows within itself. Ii is the responsi
bility of the University to allow us to be
students without the guilt that we arc
somehow participating antl perpetuating
a system of exploitation. Some students,
like myself I must admit, can at times ig
nore this fact. Others, like those involved
in this campaign, cannot, antl their aca
demic performance and motivation have

suffered.
I hold 11 it* Stanford administration re
sponsible lot this and demand that mea
sures be taken to change this. We can
begin by establishing fail hiring practices
at the University that do not depend tin
the exploitation ol people of color and
workers unable or afraid to unionize as a
result of this system of subcontracting.

"Going about it the wrong yvay." 1 his
is more than the sentiments expressed in
Friday's editorial, regarding the student
protest against unfair labor practices, it
seems to be the buz/ phrase going
around campus.
| unit>r Monica I letiesiioza tloyvnplaved
the sensationalism ol the event in her quote
yesterday to I lie Daily. I lie editorial
11 limed in: "If the protesters' pin pose was to
gain attention, they succeeded." Well,
amen. I hey can talk about the issues antl
the fundamentals antl the cornet stones anil
precedents of their actions yesterday, but
the whole scenario sinkcs me as the most
sexy, scandalous, sensational action on this
campus in years. May be decades. Bravo.
I he danger, of course, is not being able
to eflect positive change as a result of sensa
tional action. But I think positive change
was elici ted. I low many of lis gave a damn
about laboi sulx'ontractiug before yester
day ? Antl even though niosi of us still don't
give a damn enough to do anything materi
al, at least we can lend our opinion one yvay
or llii' other. A little row now and again
serves us to realize the liu I that we live in a
yvorltlol just ices and injustices, antl that hay
ing a slant! is pei haps more human than not
hay ing one al all.
So, I commend yesterday's protesters.
Don't be lools: the hospital is still going to
subcontract. Thank you, though, lor hav
ing the temerity to challenge authority,
break the law antl inconvenience your
selves lor a cause. I think the I niversitv is
ultimately better for it.

i am not sure yvhat was more illustrative,
the events of Thursday at the medical (en
ter, or the response as represented by the
letters and editorial of I lie Daily on Friday.
What is it illustrative of? It is yet another
event litre al Stanford that punt tuates the
lad that most ol the students here would
like to picture themselves as the tut in e bro
kers ol power and those that would be in a
position of authority , anil as such have a
built in ability antl tendency to empathize
with that perspective.
Fo condemn a brave young woman,
who had the determination to attempt to
get Stanford to enforce a more responsi
ble labor polity , is the product of an ex
pet lation that we .is Stan fort I students will
be in positions to broker power and in po
sitions of authority. We as students are
quit k to empathize with those already in
poyver for reasons that the readers can
hash out on their own.
May junior Monica llenestroza be
blessed forever lot attempting lo help real
people, yvith real families, who are dealing
with the real ellects ol the rising costs ol liv
ing. May she be blessed foi knowingly or un
knowinglv sacrificing her dean criminal
record and her arm for these real people.
May she be blessed for not forgetting that
though it may not have been tlieii intention,
the ultimate result of people yvho sullered
and died for us is that students like us could
live privileged lives and be here at Stanford.
Mav we iecognize the intelligent eol a sacri

\IV\M IM I I 1 t.KIN
Junior. Ilislory is lliolog\
I here is a very basic concept, essen
tial to the practice of democracy antl the
protection of our t ivil liberties, called
civil disobedience. Imagine, fora mo
ment, where our country would be
without the actions and events that took
place flut ing the civil rights movement.
The scenarios are somewhat different,
but the similarities are what is impor
tant here. What would the letters to the
editor say, looking back on history in
those cases.
From what I understand, the issues that
are at the heart of this matter arc long-stand
ingones. Dialogue (at the very least attempts
at it) and educational dibits have been at
tempted by the very organizers who were
recently arrested and the groups to which
they belong. I hose hospital officials who at e
making the decisions are certainly entitled
to ilo so, in accordance with their own lx--
liels, but would it hurt lot there to be some
greater examination "of the lints?" Would a
multi-liltetcd locus group, whose purpose
would lx' to examine relevant issues in all
lights, be a bad thing?
Perhaps the students who were arrested
made some mistakes in the physical vehe
ment e with which they protested. Mob rule
should not lx- allowed to lx- a controlling
force, but I do not think that this is the most
important element tollix i discussed here. ll'

we continue to allow 11 u * l<x ,il point of our
public dist ourse to fx-then mistakes, then I
believe that we have fallen prex lo 0111 own

I'm inclined to believe tli.it main ol us

we were 100 bus\ with job interviews and

Perhaps x\e shouldn't be content to let
history repeat it.sell here. I .el's turn this

Reactions to Thursday's protest
I here has been much misinformation
i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula
tions. In these instances, rules ol fairness,
honesty, and respect lor the rights of others
will govern our conduct at all times. Kxpe
diencA should never compromise integri
ty." Muse lolt\ c laims are ridiculously far
from the reality.
Indeed, Stanford needs to c hallenge its
own hypocrisy and ensure that all workers
on campus are treated lairlv, honestly, and
with res pec t with .1 li\ing wage, lull Ix'nefits
.lnd union protection. And until Stanford
recognizes the important e ol respec ting the
voice and the rights ol workers, we assure
you that this movement will not cease. We
urge the community to continue support
ing this issue until justice is won.

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan
lord I lospital ("Protesters' behavior
hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem
bers ol all these organizations, was to hold
Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
vices I.ou Saksen accountable to this com
munity, not necessarily to convince him
that subcontracting was unjust. The need
for such action was urgent. Saksen had re
peatedly demonstrated indifference to the
issue and planned, in I lie Daily's words,
"to sign a contract to outsource the posi
tions as soon as possible."
II the editors possess a distorted ac
count ot the events, they are probably not
alone. I lie Daily lot its part, contributed
to public misunderstanding bv framing
their (overage ol the event in a biased
manner. I he Daily does not a present a
students' account ol the events. It men
lions onl\ the students' opinion tli.it the\
were conscious ol patients and their view
of an incident that resulted in an injury
(two of the students, I will pedantically
point out, were not inside the hospital, as
the article claims). Students either were
not given a ( hance to respond to the accu
sation tli.it they "Ibrced their wa\ into the
administrative offices" and "became phys
ical with hospital personnel and verbally
abused them." or else tli.it response was
consigned to the journalistic dustbin.
Student accounts present a ver\ differ
ent picture from the one a reader would
glean from I lie Daily. I lie students en
tered peacefully and asked to meet with
Saksen. I hey waited for Saksen to con
clude <i meeting, during which time one ol
the students entered an adjacent physi
cians' lounge to inform them ol their pur
pose and | >l.in and added that they did not
wish to disturb them but that they were
welcome to join. When Saksen appeared,
the student spokesperson presented the
group's demand that he stop subconiract
ing, talk to the student delegation or ad
dress the protesters outside. Saksen re
fused to discuss the issue further with the
students and walked away.
1 lie students followed him until he en
tered not an ollice but a public lounge and
he c losed tlie dooi behind him. I lie sec u
rity guards then tried to physically remove
them. 1 he police, upon arrival, informed
security personnel that it was illegal lor the
guards to use physical tone to remove stu
dents without lit st dec laring a citizen's ar
rest. A citizen's arrest was then dec lared,
and the students were given the c hoice to
leave or be arrested. 1 hey chose the latter.
rhus, to continue to believe, as the edi
tors did, that the students were "forcing
their way intoan ollice . . . and making ex -
plic it demands." is to accept one version of
the events and to deny the validity of the
other. New, what all of us do agree upon is
that the students were arrested lor tres
passing, one of the most frequent disobe
dience techniques employed by non-vio
lent social movements. II the campaign to
end subcontlading is'extremist" tor tics
passing in order to impress upon Saksen
and the university administration the ur
gency of this issue, then so were the 54
protesters arrested for occupying Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ollice in order to
issue demands relating to multicultural
life at Stanford. Like Thursday's
protesters, these students had met with
administrative indifference, in this case,
loi years. II last week's protesters were
"out ol line," so were the 294 students that
were arrested lor refusing to leave Old
I'nion in 11 >77. in oiclei to protest Stan
lord's links to corporations invested in
apartheid South Africa. I ike the protest last
1 hursclav, this was part of a year-long ethi
cal ic >n and ac tivist campaign.
I he history ol activism suggests that
these ac lions, whic li the editors may deem
"neither appropriate nor consti uc live," arc
taken only alter other channels are exhaust
ed and the administration continually
proves to be negligent and non-cooperative.
1 )ue to I hursday's protest, the adminis
tration has agreed to arrange a meeting be
tween students antl 1 diversity President
|ohn Ilcnnessv, Provost |ohn Etcheineiidy
and Saksen on Wednesday. I he I Diversity
administration conceded this only after a
team ol student delegates negotiated with
ollicials tor several hours alter the six stu
dents at the hospital were arrested. I lowev
er, the meeting is closed, and as ol the writ
ing of this letter, the administration ictuses
to allow workers to attend, thus demon
strating further indillercncc towards this
issue. Saksen, in signing the agreement sub
conirac ting 10 housekeeping positions, has
taken a step towards a policy subcontract
ing that could ailed 440 positions without
adopting a living wage position.
There is, however, a '10-day escape
clause that can be utilized, but only it ad
min ist ration is pressured into changing its
stance. I'd like to repeat the community
leaders and organizers' joint letter
("Protest organizers justify actions, call lor
further support"): "the issues that we are
fighting for remain unaddrcssed." To all
those who have been inspired to the cause
of labor justice, I hope you work to effect
c hange with whatever non-violent means
you choose.

Reading Friday's Daily and the opin
ions section, I am struck by how the paper
is joining with the University in minimiz
ing the significance of the subcontracting

issue. I was also struck by the clear hi.is in
the opinions sec tion toward criticizing and
slandering the efforts of a protesting
group of students who believe in a cause.
The Daily printed two long and malicious
letters to the editor while tailing to print an
opinion In students strongly supporting
the cause.
Hy printing such long and hateful let
ters to the editor, taking up practically
one-third of the opinions page plus the ed
itorial. the paper is clearly not being a non
partisan participant in the dialogue.
I he Daily could have easily written an
otliei story more deeply outlining the
spec ilics about the subcontracting issue to
better inform the Stanford community
about what is going on in the hospital and
how that would ailed individual lives. I
also think The Daily could have given the
protesters more coverage in the paper.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
On tlw ex>ening oj Thursday, Nov. 2 I K I he
Daily's Opinions stuff laid out eveiy letter it re
ceived before 10 p.m. regarding the subcontract
ing issue and protest tluit afternoon. After that
point in time, a representative of the groups that or
ganized the protest contacted us /n telephone, re
questing that we extentl our Opinions deadline to
accomtxltite an addUumtd letter.
We com filled villi this request, printing the let
ter headlined "Protest organizers justify action,
call for further sufrfHrrt," and signed In leaders
and organizers from MEChA, PASU, SAAAC,
SCTJ, SEAS and SI AC.
1 would like to |k»ini out the bias in The
Daily 's article on the rally against subcon
tracting and the choice to sensationalize the
issue rather than focus on pertinent infor
mation. The structure of the news article it
self (I lospital / Administrative arguments,
the students' account, and then Hospital/
Administrative rebuttal) betrays this bias.
Furthermore, we did not "force our way"
into Saksen's office, we simply walked in. We
were Ibllc wing Saksen into a room, while he
walked away from us, when the door was
dosed on the student's arm. More impor
tantly, we all need to de-emphasize the sen
sationalist descriptions of what happened in
the hospital. It takes away from what's im
portant: the workers who will suffer from
sulxontracting and the decision makers
who can prevent it.
I lie ac cusations in the letters to the edi
tor .ire based purely on hearsay and partic
ular!) absurd. I am speaking of the letters
that was written by an undeclared fresh
man who has been on campus tor one
quarter and a sophomore who says that the
widely circulated e-mail I wrote represents
"modern media," whatever that means.
I hese letters were written even before 1 he
Daily came out, which means there was no
official or reliable source of information for
the events that occurred at all, only ru
mors. yet the authors still felt qualified to
write about the events as if they witnessed
the events personally.
This resulted in broad, nonsensical as
sumptions that have no support. I ac knowl
edge that inv e-mail, which was written in 15
minutes during the middle of the rally,
added to confusion, but it is no justification
lor ii rational, (insupportable judgements or
refusing to wait and line! out the tacts. For
instance, one letter assumes students were
arrested tor "breaking and entering," while
the other points towards "Ibrced entry."
For these reasons and many others, 1
found The Daily's coverage of the protest to
Ik- irresponsible. Hie contract has been
signed. Ten workers are earning poverty
wages, vet The Daily thinks that getting a
ti(ket lor trespassing, a common result ot
peaceful (ivil disobedience, is too extreme.
The Daily is simultaneously advocating
against an injustice and against doing some
thing "ellective" about it.
OWEN LI
ptnurr, Asuin-Anuruwn Slutltes
As the campaign against subcontracting
escalates, I believe it's essential that the Stan
lord community remain focused not only
on the issue at hand but also on its broader
implications.
As a coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Justice At Stanford, I am well
aware of the pattern of neglectful policies
the Stanford I lospital has directed at low -in
come communities of color. During SEAS's
Medical Waste ('.ampaign, students success
tully fought to stop the hospital from send
ing its dioxin-produt ing waste to an incin
erator in ()akland. A 1994 EPA report con
firmed that dioxin promotes cancer, can
cause severe reproductive and develop
mental problems, can damage the immune
system and can interfere with regulatory
hormones.
So I ask: why would a hospital of all places
knowingly contribute to dioxin production,
given the severe health threat that it poses?
Does cost minimization justify the exploita
tion of people and the environment? And is
it morally acceptable to exploit those who do
not even have the political clout to defend
themselves?
It was not until students voiced their
concerns that the hospital agreed to adopt
a safer method of medical waste disposal.

Now the hospital has signed a com rat t to
subcontract jobs, meaning lower wages,
fewer benefits and compromised sanita
tion at the hospital (due to (lit- inevitable
inexperience of lower paid, temporary
workers). Yet again, hospital administra
tors are avoiding accountability tor their
actions because there is no moral ground
to support their stance.
[list as the resit lent so! Oakland sought
help in their light to eliminate <li< >\m lie>m
their neighborhoods, workers now seek our
help to tight lor lair labor standards. I ea
gerly await the day when unjust policies will
not Ik- implemented in the lirst place. In the
meantime, we should speak out for the
rights of others, rights that have been de
nied in the name ol economic s.
Whether vour pretet red jargon is politi
cal, spiritual, philosophical or other, the
tcncts of t ivit dutv, compassion, just it e, and
basic human deccnc\ all boil down to one
thing: moral progress. ()urstx ietv could use
some. As students at a prestigious universi
ty, we have a powerful opportunit\ and a se
rious responsibility to bridge the gap be
tween decision-makers and the affected. We
can promote antl engage in meaningful ex
changes that will result in a more enlight
ened, unified and consensual six ietv.

1 am writing this letter in ordei It) ex
press ni\ ow 11 pet sonal outrage about the
occurrences t>l Ii itla\ antl lurthei more to
demantl the resignation ol Lou Saksen,
Stanford Hospital's \ it t* President of
General Services. I am not representing
any organization through ibis letter, but
my own views.
On I hursdav, six Stanford student
leaders were arrested loi peacefully
protesting an injustice: non-union, low
accountability, low wage, no-benelit sul>-
contrat ling that would allow the Stanford
I lospital to "t lean its hands" from part it i
pation in the exploitation ol predomi
nantly Black, Asian antl Latino workers.
We can not allow the I lospital nor the ad
ministration to pretend it has no respon
sibility in this matter. I liev do!
On Friday, more than 100 students
gathered around the hospital in ordei to
demantl a meeting with Saksen, who
presently lias the livelihood ol at least 10
workers in his hands. I hey sought the op
portunity as Stanford community mem
bers to express their views about his im
pending decision to begin the process of
non-union subcontracting, which toiild
potentially ailed I 10 nioie hospital work
ers and set a precedent not only at Stanford
but other universities to develop the same
unfair hiring prat (ires.
Light students entered the hospital and
after Saksen refused to meet with tlieni,
were accosted, harrassed antl forcefully re
moved by Lou Saksen's bouncers — unau
thorized layv enforcement officers. I he po
lite then had to free these students from
these bouncers before they could even ar
rest them. Six students were ai rested.
Afterwards, more than 150 students
gathered outside of the office of I niveisity
President |ohn I lennessy in order to de
mand the release of 'these six students and to
the end of non-union siibt out rat ting ai
Stanford. For yvhatevei reasons, we t lit I not
see I lennessy nor heai li< >\n hew as g< >iilg to
ileal witli this problem. Ii seems that per
haps he is not fully aware of what has ot
t lin ed today and what lias been happening
throughout this "Stop Subcontracting"
campaign.
In the past weeks, the members ol the
Stanford Labor Action C.oalition had
hoped to be able to come to a laii agree
ment com crning fair hii ing pt at tit rs with
Saksen. If not, they hoped to stop the mo
tion to begin sulx ontrai ling antl ai least in
volve more of the people directly affected
by it in the decision-making process. I his
has not happened, and wit I i the at lions In
Saksen and his bouncers, ii is clear that it
will not happen willi him in the seat ol
power, nor without a fairer sy stem of liu ing
at the Stanford 1 lospital.
One man should not have full decision
making poyver. Workers antl concerned
Stanford community nientbei s should have
a say. And if our voice yvill in>t be heard t >r re
spected through traditional means then
they must anil will be heart I thiough means
of our own devising.
Fvery individual who witnessed what oc
curred on Friday should and must at the
very least voice their opinion directly to
those who have poyver over this situation,
Saksen and Hennessy. Do not keep your
outrage or your opinions to yourself. Do not
depend on other students to voice your
opinion for you. It is an unfair burden that
they as students should not have to bear. I
have witnessed several extremely intelli
gent and talented individuals who have
been involved in this campaign from the
beginning deteriorate emotionally from
trying to battle the in justices that the I ni
versity — that they pay money to attend
— allows within itself. Ii is the responsi
bility of the University to allow us to be
students without the guilt that we arc
somehow participating antl perpetuating
a system of exploitation. Some students,
like myself I must admit, can at times ig
nore this fact. Others, like those involved
in this campaign, cannot, antl their aca
demic performance and motivation have

suffered.
I hold 11 it* Stanford administration re
sponsible lot this and demand that mea
sures be taken to change this. We can
begin by establishing fail hiring practices
at the University that do not depend tin
the exploitation ol people of color and
workers unable or afraid to unionize as a
result of this system of subcontracting.

"Going about it the wrong yvay." 1 his
is more than the sentiments expressed in
Friday's editorial, regarding the student
protest against unfair labor practices, it
seems to be the buz/ phrase going
around campus.
| unit>r Monica I letiesiioza tloyvnplaved
the sensationalism ol the event in her quote
yesterday to I lie Daily. I lie editorial
11 limed in: "If the protesters' pin pose was to
gain attention, they succeeded." Well,
amen. I hey can talk about the issues antl
the fundamentals antl the cornet stones anil
precedents of their actions yesterday, but
the whole scenario sinkcs me as the most
sexy, scandalous, sensational action on this
campus in years. May be decades. Bravo.
I he danger, of course, is not being able
to eflect positive change as a result of sensa
tional action. But I think positive change
was elici ted. I low many of lis gave a damn
about laboi sulx'ontractiug before yester
day ? Antl even though niosi of us still don't
give a damn enough to do anything materi
al, at least we can lend our opinion one yvay
or llii' other. A little row now and again
serves us to realize the liu I that we live in a
yvorltlol just ices and injustices, antl that hay
ing a slant! is pei haps more human than not
hay ing one al all.
So, I commend yesterday's protesters.
Don't be lools: the hospital is still going to
subcontract. Thank you, though, lor hav
ing the temerity to challenge authority,
break the law antl inconvenience your
selves lor a cause. I think the I niversitv is
ultimately better for it.

i am not sure yvhat was more illustrative,
the events of Thursday at the medical (en
ter, or the response as represented by the
letters and editorial of I lie Daily on Friday.
What is it illustrative of? It is yet another
event litre al Stanford that punt tuates the
lad that most ol the students here would
like to picture themselves as the tut in e bro
kers ol power and those that would be in a
position of authority , anil as such have a
built in ability antl tendency to empathize
with that perspective.
Fo condemn a brave young woman,
who had the determination to attempt to
get Stanford to enforce a more responsi
ble labor polity , is the product of an ex
pet lation that we .is Stan fort I students will
be in positions to broker power and in po
sitions of authority. We as students are
quit k to empathize with those already in
poyver for reasons that the readers can
hash out on their own.
May junior Monica llenestroza be
blessed forever lot attempting lo help real
people, yvith real families, who are dealing
with the real ellects ol the rising costs ol liv
ing. May she be blessed foi knowingly or un
knowinglv sacrificing her dean criminal
record and her arm for these real people.
May she be blessed for not forgetting that
though it may not have been tlieii intention,
the ultimate result of people yvho sullered
and died for us is that students like us could
live privileged lives and be here at Stanford.
Mav we iecognize the intelligent eol a sacri

Stanford.
\IV\M IM I I 1 t.KIN
Junior. Ilislory is lliolog\
I here is a very basic concept, essen
tial to the practice of democracy antl the
protection of our t ivil liberties, called
civil disobedience. Imagine, fora mo
ment, where our country would be
without the actions and events that took
place flut ing the civil rights movement.
The scenarios are somewhat different,
but the similarities are what is impor
tant here. What would the letters to the
editor say, looking back on history in
those cases.
From what I understand, the issues that
are at the heart of this matter arc long-stand
ingones. Dialogue (at the very least attempts
at it) and educational dibits have been at
tempted by the very organizers who were
recently arrested and the groups to which
they belong. I hose hospital officials who at e
making the decisions are certainly entitled
to ilo so, in accordance with their own lx--
liels, but would it hurt lot there to be some
greater examination "of the lints?" Would a
multi-liltetcd locus group, whose purpose
would lx' to examine relevant issues in all
lights, be a bad thing?
Perhaps the students who were arrested
made some mistakes in the physical vehe
ment e with which they protested. Mob rule
should not lx- allowed to lx- a controlling
force, but I do not think that this is the most
important element tollix i discussed here. ll'

we continue to allow 11 u * l<x ,il point of our
public dist ourse to fx-then mistakes, then I
believe that we have fallen prex lo 0111 own

we were 100 bus\ with job interviews and
end-of-terin projects, oi max be (just m«i\ 1 k-)
soineol us pist didn't agree.
Perhaps x\e shouldn't be content to let
history repeat it.sell here. I .el's turn this

Reactions to Thursday's protest
I here has been much misinformation
i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan
lord I lospital ("Protesters' behavior
hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem
bers ol all these organizations, was to hold
Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
vices I.ou Saksen accountable to this com
munity, not necessarily to convince him
that subcontracting was unjust. The need
for such action was urgent. Saksen had re
peatedly demonstrated indifference to the
issue and planned, in I lie Daily's words,
"to sign a contract to outsource the posi
tions as soon as possible."
II the editors possess a distorted ac
count ot the events, they are probably not
alone. I lie Daily lot its part, contributed
to public misunderstanding bv framing
their (overage ol the event in a biased
manner. I he Daily does not a present a
students' account ol the events. It men
lions onl\ the students' opinion tli.it the\
were conscious ol patients and their view
of an incident that resulted in an injury
(two of the students, I will pedantically
point out, were not inside the hospital, as
the article claims). Students either were
not given a ( hance to respond to the accu
sation tli.it they "Ibrced their wa\ into the
administrative offices" and "became phys
ical with hospital personnel and verbally
abused them." or else tli.it response was
consigned to the journalistic dustbin.
Student accounts present a ver\ differ
ent picture from the one a reader would
glean from I lie Daily. I lie students en
tered peacefully and asked to meet with
Saksen. I hey waited for Saksen to con
clude <i meeting, during which time one ol
the students entered an adjacent physi
cians' lounge to inform them ol their pur
pose and | >l.in and added that they did not
wish to disturb them but that they were
welcome to join. When Saksen appeared,
the student spokesperson presented the
group's demand that he stop subconiract
ing, talk to the student delegation or ad
dress the protesters outside. Saksen re
fused to discuss the issue further with the
students and walked away.
1 lie students followed him until he en
tered not an ollice but a public lounge and
he c losed tlie dooi behind him. I lie sec u
rity guards then tried to physically remove
them. 1 he police, upon arrival, informed
security personnel that it was illegal lor the
guards to use physical tone to remove stu
dents without lit st dec laring a citizen's ar
rest. A citizen's arrest was then dec lared,
and the students were given the c hoice to
leave or be arrested. 1 hey chose the latter.
rhus, to continue to believe, as the edi
tors did, that the students were "forcing
their way intoan ollice . . . and making ex -
plic it demands." is to accept one version of
the events and to deny the validity of the
other. New, what all of us do agree upon is
that the students were arrested lor tres
passing, one of the most frequent disobe
dience techniques employed by non-vio
lent social movements. II the campaign to
end subcontlading is'extremist" tor tics
passing in order to impress upon Saksen
and the university administration the ur
gency of this issue, then so were the 54
protesters arrested for occupying Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ollice in order to
issue demands relating to multicultural
life at Stanford. Like Thursday's
protesters, these students had met with
administrative indifference, in this case,
loi years. II last week's protesters were
"out ol line," so were the 294 students that
were arrested lor refusing to leave Old
I'nion in 11 >77. in oiclei to protest Stan
lord's links to corporations invested in
apartheid South Africa. I ike the protest last
1 hursclav, this was part of a year-long ethi
cal ic >n and ac tivist campaign.
I he history ol activism suggests that
these ac lions, whic li the editors may deem
"neither appropriate nor consti uc live," arc
taken only alter other channels are exhaust
ed and the administration continually
proves to be negligent and non-cooperative.
1 )ue to I hursday's protest, the adminis
tration has agreed to arrange a meeting be
tween students antl 1 diversity President
|ohn Ilcnnessv, Provost |ohn Etcheineiidy
and Saksen on Wednesday. I he I Diversity
administration conceded this only after a
team ol student delegates negotiated with
ollicials tor several hours alter the six stu
dents at the hospital were arrested. I lowev
er, the meeting is closed, and as ol the writ
ing of this letter, the administration ictuses
to allow workers to attend, thus demon
strating further indillercncc towards this
issue. Saksen, in signing the agreement sub
conirac ting 10 housekeeping positions, has
taken a step towards a policy subcontract
ing that could ailed 440 positions without
adopting a living wage position.
There is, however, a '10-day escape
clause that can be utilized, but only it ad
min ist ration is pressured into changing its
stance. I'd like to repeat the community
leaders and organizers' joint letter
("Protest organizers justify actions, call lor
further support"): "the issues that we are
fighting for remain unaddrcssed." To all
those who have been inspired to the cause
of labor justice, I hope you work to effect
c hange with whatever non-violent means
you choose.

Reading Friday's Daily and the opin
ions section, I am struck by how the paper
is joining with the University in minimiz
ing the significance of the subcontracting

issue. I was also struck by the clear hi.is in
the opinions sec tion toward criticizing and
slandering the efforts of a protesting
group of students who believe in a cause.
The Daily printed two long and malicious
letters to the editor while tailing to print an
opinion In students strongly supporting
the cause.
Hy printing such long and hateful let
ters to the editor, taking up practically
one-third of the opinions page plus the ed
itorial. the paper is clearly not being a non
partisan participant in the dialogue.
I he Daily could have easily written an
otliei story more deeply outlining the
spec ilics about the subcontracting issue to
better inform the Stanford community
about what is going on in the hospital and
how that would ailed individual lives. I
also think The Daily could have given the
protesters more coverage in the paper.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
On tlw ex>ening oj Thursday, Nov. 2 I K I he
Daily's Opinions stuff laid out eveiy letter it re
ceived before 10 p.m. regarding the subcontract
ing issue and protest tluit afternoon. After that
point in time, a representative of the groups that or
ganized the protest contacted us /n telephone, re
questing that we extentl our Opinions deadline to
accomtxltite an addUumtd letter.
We com filled villi this request, printing the let
ter headlined "Protest organizers justify action,
call for further sufrfHrrt," and signed In leaders
and organizers from MEChA, PASU, SAAAC,
SCTJ, SEAS and SI AC.
1 would like to |k»ini out the bias in The
Daily 's article on the rally against subcon
tracting and the choice to sensationalize the
issue rather than focus on pertinent infor
mation. The structure of the news article it
self (I lospital / Administrative arguments,
the students' account, and then Hospital/
Administrative rebuttal) betrays this bias.
Furthermore, we did not "force our way"
into Saksen's office, we simply walked in. We
were Ibllc wing Saksen into a room, while he
walked away from us, when the door was
dosed on the student's arm. More impor
tantly, we all need to de-emphasize the sen
sationalist descriptions of what happened in
the hospital. It takes away from what's im
portant: the workers who will suffer from
sulxontracting and the decision makers
who can prevent it.
I lie ac cusations in the letters to the edi
tor .ire based purely on hearsay and partic
ular!) absurd. I am speaking of the letters
that was written by an undeclared fresh
man who has been on campus tor one
quarter and a sophomore who says that the
widely circulated e-mail I wrote represents
"modern media," whatever that means.
I hese letters were written even before 1 he
Daily came out, which means there was no
official or reliable source of information for
the events that occurred at all, only ru
mors. yet the authors still felt qualified to
write about the events as if they witnessed
the events personally.
This resulted in broad, nonsensical as
sumptions that have no support. I ac knowl
edge that inv e-mail, which was written in 15
minutes during the middle of the rally,
added to confusion, but it is no justification
lor ii rational, (insupportable judgements or
refusing to wait and line! out the tacts. For
instance, one letter assumes students were
arrested tor "breaking and entering," while
the other points towards "Ibrced entry."
For these reasons and many others, 1
found The Daily's coverage of the protest to
Ik- irresponsible. Hie contract has been
signed. Ten workers are earning poverty
wages, vet The Daily thinks that getting a
ti(ket lor trespassing, a common result ot
peaceful (ivil disobedience, is too extreme.
The Daily is simultaneously advocating
against an injustice and against doing some
thing "ellective" about it.
OWEN LI
ptnurr, Asuin-Anuruwn Slutltes
As the campaign against subcontracting
escalates, I believe it's essential that the Stan
lord community remain focused not only
on the issue at hand but also on its broader
implications.
As a coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Justice At Stanford, I am well
aware of the pattern of neglectful policies
the Stanford I lospital has directed at low -in
come communities of color. During SEAS's
Medical Waste ('.ampaign, students success
tully fought to stop the hospital from send
ing its dioxin-produt ing waste to an incin
erator in ()akland. A 1994 EPA report con
firmed that dioxin promotes cancer, can
cause severe reproductive and develop
mental problems, can damage the immune
system and can interfere with regulatory
hormones.
So I ask: why would a hospital of all places
knowingly contribute to dioxin production,
given the severe health threat that it poses?
Does cost minimization justify the exploita
tion of people and the environment? And is
it morally acceptable to exploit those who do
not even have the political clout to defend
themselves?
It was not until students voiced their
concerns that the hospital agreed to adopt
a safer method of medical waste disposal.

Now the hospital has signed a com rat t to
subcontract jobs, meaning lower wages,
fewer benefits and compromised sanita
tion at the hospital (due to (lit- inevitable
inexperience of lower paid, temporary
workers). Yet again, hospital administra
tors are avoiding accountability tor their
actions because there is no moral ground
to support their stance.
[list as the resit lent so! Oakland sought
help in their light to eliminate <li< >\m lie>m
their neighborhoods, workers now seek our
help to tight lor lair labor standards. I ea
gerly await the day when unjust policies will
not Ik- implemented in the lirst place. In the
meantime, we should speak out for the
rights of others, rights that have been de
nied in the name ol economic s.
Whether vour pretet red jargon is politi
cal, spiritual, philosophical or other, the
tcncts of t ivit dutv, compassion, just it e, and
basic human deccnc\ all boil down to one
thing: moral progress. ()urstx ietv could use
some. As students at a prestigious universi
ty, we have a powerful opportunit\ and a se
rious responsibility to bridge the gap be
tween decision-makers and the affected. We
can promote antl engage in meaningful ex
changes that will result in a more enlight
ened, unified and consensual six ietv.

1 am writing this letter in ordei It) ex
press ni\ ow 11 pet sonal outrage about the
occurrences t>l Ii itla\ antl lurthei more to
demantl the resignation ol Lou Saksen,
Stanford Hospital's \ it t* President of
General Services. I am not representing
any organization through ibis letter, but
my own views.
On I hursdav, six Stanford student
leaders were arrested loi peacefully
protesting an injustice: non-union, low
accountability, low wage, no-benelit sul>-
contrat ling that would allow the Stanford
I lospital to "t lean its hands" from part it i
pation in the exploitation ol predomi
nantly Black, Asian antl Latino workers.
We can not allow the I lospital nor the ad
ministration to pretend it has no respon
sibility in this matter. I liev do!
On Friday, more than 100 students
gathered around the hospital in ordei to
demantl a meeting with Saksen, who
presently lias the livelihood ol at least 10
workers in his hands. I hey sought the op
portunity as Stanford community mem
bers to express their views about his im
pending decision to begin the process of
non-union subcontracting, which toiild
potentially ailed I 10 nioie hospital work
ers and set a precedent not only at Stanford
but other universities to develop the same
unfair hiring prat (ires.
Light students entered the hospital and
after Saksen refused to meet with tlieni,
were accosted, harrassed antl forcefully re
moved by Lou Saksen's bouncers — unau
thorized layv enforcement officers. I he po
lite then had to free these students from
these bouncers before they could even ar
rest them. Six students were ai rested.
Afterwards, more than 150 students
gathered outside of the office of I niveisity
President |ohn I lennessy in order to de
mand the release of 'these six students and to
the end of non-union siibt out rat ting ai
Stanford. For yvhatevei reasons, we t lit I not
see I lennessy nor heai li< >\n hew as g< >iilg to
ileal witli this problem. Ii seems that per
haps he is not fully aware of what has ot
t lin ed today and what lias been happening
throughout this "Stop Subcontracting"
campaign.
In the past weeks, the members ol the
Stanford Labor Action C.oalition had
hoped to be able to come to a laii agree
ment com crning fair hii ing pt at tit rs with
Saksen. If not, they hoped to stop the mo
tion to begin sulx ontrai ling antl ai least in
volve more of the people directly affected
by it in the decision-making process. I his
has not happened, and wit I i the at lions In
Saksen and his bouncers, ii is clear that it
will not happen willi him in the seat ol
power, nor without a fairer sy stem of liu ing
at the Stanford 1 lospital.
One man should not have full decision
making poyver. Workers antl concerned
Stanford community nientbei s should have
a say. And if our voice yvill in>t be heard t >r re
spected through traditional means then
they must anil will be heart I thiough means
of our own devising.
Fvery individual who witnessed what oc
curred on Friday should and must at the
very least voice their opinion directly to
those who have poyver over this situation,
Saksen and Hennessy. Do not keep your
outrage or your opinions to yourself. Do not
depend on other students to voice your
opinion for you. It is an unfair burden that
they as students should not have to bear. I
have witnessed several extremely intelli
gent and talented individuals who have
been involved in this campaign from the
beginning deteriorate emotionally from
trying to battle the in justices that the I ni
versity — that they pay money to attend
— allows within itself. Ii is the responsi
bility of the University to allow us to be
students without the guilt that we arc
somehow participating antl perpetuating
a system of exploitation. Some students,
like myself I must admit, can at times ig
nore this fact. Others, like those involved
in this campaign, cannot, antl their aca
demic performance and motivation have

suffered.
I hold 11 it* Stanford administration re
sponsible lot this and demand that mea
sures be taken to change this. We can
begin by establishing fail hiring practices
at the University that do not depend tin
the exploitation ol people of color and
workers unable or afraid to unionize as a
result of this system of subcontracting.

"Going about it the wrong yvay." 1 his
is more than the sentiments expressed in
Friday's editorial, regarding the student
protest against unfair labor practices, it
seems to be the buz/ phrase going
around campus.
| unit>r Monica I letiesiioza tloyvnplaved
the sensationalism ol the event in her quote
yesterday to I lie Daily. I lie editorial
11 limed in: "If the protesters' pin pose was to
gain attention, they succeeded." Well,
amen. I hey can talk about the issues antl
the fundamentals antl the cornet stones anil
precedents of their actions yesterday, but
the whole scenario sinkcs me as the most
sexy, scandalous, sensational action on this
campus in years. May be decades. Bravo.
I he danger, of course, is not being able
to eflect positive change as a result of sensa
tional action. But I think positive change
was elici ted. I low many of lis gave a damn
about laboi sulx'ontractiug before yester
day ? Antl even though niosi of us still don't
give a damn enough to do anything materi
al, at least we can lend our opinion one yvay
or llii' other. A little row now and again
serves us to realize the liu I that we live in a
yvorltlol just ices and injustices, antl that hay
ing a slant! is pei haps more human than not
hay ing one al all.
So, I commend yesterday's protesters.
Don't be lools: the hospital is still going to
subcontract. Thank you, though, lor hav
ing the temerity to challenge authority,
break the law antl inconvenience your
selves lor a cause. I think the I niversitv is
ultimately better for it.

i am not sure yvhat was more illustrative,
the events of Thursday at the medical (en
ter, or the response as represented by the
letters and editorial of I lie Daily on Friday.
What is it illustrative of? It is yet another
event litre al Stanford that punt tuates the
lad that most ol the students here would
like to picture themselves as the tut in e bro
kers ol power and those that would be in a
position of authority , anil as such have a
built in ability antl tendency to empathize
with that perspective.
Fo condemn a brave young woman,
who had the determination to attempt to
get Stanford to enforce a more responsi
ble labor polity , is the product of an ex
pet lation that we .is Stan fort I students will
be in positions to broker power and in po
sitions of authority. We as students are
quit k to empathize with those already in
poyver for reasons that the readers can
hash out on their own.
May junior Monica llenestroza be
blessed forever lot attempting lo help real
people, yvith real families, who are dealing
with the real ellects ol the rising costs ol liv
ing. May she be blessed foi knowingly or un
knowinglv sacrificing her dean criminal
record and her arm for these real people.
May she be blessed for not forgetting that
though it may not have been tlieii intention,
the ultimate result of people yvho sullered
and died for us is that students like us could
live privileged lives and be here at Stanford.
Mav we iecognize the intelligent eol a sacri

\IV\M IM I I 1 t.KIN
Junior. Ilislory is lliolog\
I here is a very basic concept, essen
tial to the practice of democracy antl the
protection of our t ivil liberties, called
civil disobedience. Imagine, fora mo
ment, where our country would be
without the actions and events that took
place flut ing the civil rights movement.
The scenarios are somewhat different,
but the similarities are what is impor
tant here. What would the letters to the
editor say, looking back on history in
those cases.
From what I understand, the issues that
are at the heart of this matter arc long-stand
ingones. Dialogue (at the very least attempts
at it) and educational dibits have been at
tempted by the very organizers who were
recently arrested and the groups to which
they belong. I hose hospital officials who at e
making the decisions are certainly entitled
to ilo so, in accordance with their own lx--
liels, but would it hurt lot there to be some
greater examination "of the lints?" Would a
multi-liltetcd locus group, whose purpose
would lx' to examine relevant issues in all
lights, be a bad thing?
Perhaps the students who were arrested
made some mistakes in the physical vehe
ment e with which they protested. Mob rule
should not lx- allowed to lx- a controlling
force, but I do not think that this is the most
important element tollix i discussed here. ll'

we continue to allow 11 u * l<x ,il point of our
public dist ourse to fx-then mistakes, then I
believe that we have fallen prex lo 0111 own

Perhaps x\e shouldn't be content to let

i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula
tions. In these instances, rules ol fairness,
honesty, and respect lor the rights of others
will govern our conduct at all times. Kxpe
diencA should never compromise integri
ty." Muse lolt\ c laims are ridiculously far
from the reality.
Indeed, Stanford needs to c hallenge its
own hypocrisy and ensure that all workers
on campus are treated lairlv, honestly, and
with res pec t with .1 li\ing wage, lull Ix'nefits
.lnd union protection. And until Stanford
recognizes the important e ol respec ting the
voice and the rights ol workers, we assure
you that this movement will not cease. We
urge the community to continue support
ing this issue until justice is won.

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan
lord I lospital ("Protesters' behavior
hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem
bers ol all these organizations, was to hold
Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
vices I.ou Saksen accountable to this com
munity, not necessarily to convince him
that subcontracting was unjust. The need
for such action was urgent. Saksen had re
peatedly demonstrated indifference to the
issue and planned, in I lie Daily's words,
"to sign a contract to outsource the posi
tions as soon as possible."
II the editors possess a distorted ac
count ot the events, they are probably not
alone. I lie Daily lot its part, contributed
to public misunderstanding bv framing
their (overage ol the event in a biased
manner. I he Daily does not a present a
students' account ol the events. It men
lions onl\ the students' opinion tli.it the\
were conscious ol patients and their view
of an incident that resulted in an injury
(two of the students, I will pedantically
point out, were not inside the hospital, as
the article claims). Students either were
not given a ( hance to respond to the accu
sation tli.it they "Ibrced their wa\ into the
administrative offices" and "became phys
ical with hospital personnel and verbally
abused them." or else tli.it response was
consigned to the journalistic dustbin.
Student accounts present a ver\ differ
ent picture from the one a reader would
glean from I lie Daily. I lie students en
tered peacefully and asked to meet with
Saksen. I hey waited for Saksen to con
clude <i meeting, during which time one ol
the students entered an adjacent physi
cians' lounge to inform them ol their pur
pose and | >l.in and added that they did not
wish to disturb them but that they were
welcome to join. When Saksen appeared,
the student spokesperson presented the
group's demand that he stop subconiract
ing, talk to the student delegation or ad
dress the protesters outside. Saksen re
fused to discuss the issue further with the
students and walked away.
1 lie students followed him until he en
tered not an ollice but a public lounge and
he c losed tlie dooi behind him. I lie sec u
rity guards then tried to physically remove
them. 1 he police, upon arrival, informed
security personnel that it was illegal lor the
guards to use physical tone to remove stu
dents without lit st dec laring a citizen's ar
rest. A citizen's arrest was then dec lared,
and the students were given the c hoice to
leave or be arrested. 1 hey chose the latter.
rhus, to continue to believe, as the edi
tors did, that the students were "forcing
their way intoan ollice . . . and making ex -
plic it demands." is to accept one version of
the events and to deny the validity of the
other. New, what all of us do agree upon is
that the students were arrested lor tres
passing, one of the most frequent disobe
dience techniques employed by non-vio
lent social movements. II the campaign to
end subcontlading is'extremist" tor tics
passing in order to impress upon Saksen
and the university administration the ur
gency of this issue, then so were the 54
protesters arrested for occupying Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ollice in order to
issue demands relating to multicultural
life at Stanford. Like Thursday's
protesters, these students had met with
administrative indifference, in this case,
loi years. II last week's protesters were
"out ol line," so were the 294 students that
were arrested lor refusing to leave Old
I'nion in 11 >77. in oiclei to protest Stan
lord's links to corporations invested in
apartheid South Africa. I ike the protest last
1 hursclav, this was part of a year-long ethi
cal ic >n and ac tivist campaign.
I he history ol activism suggests that
these ac lions, whic li the editors may deem
"neither appropriate nor consti uc live," arc
taken only alter other channels are exhaust
ed and the administration continually
proves to be negligent and non-cooperative.
1 )ue to I hursday's protest, the adminis
tration has agreed to arrange a meeting be
tween students antl 1 diversity President
|ohn Ilcnnessv, Provost |ohn Etcheineiidy
and Saksen on Wednesday. I he I Diversity
administration conceded this only after a
team ol student delegates negotiated with
ollicials tor several hours alter the six stu
dents at the hospital were arrested. I lowev
er, the meeting is closed, and as ol the writ
ing of this letter, the administration ictuses
to allow workers to attend, thus demon
strating further indillercncc towards this
issue. Saksen, in signing the agreement sub
conirac ting 10 housekeeping positions, has
taken a step towards a policy subcontract
ing that could ailed 440 positions without
adopting a living wage position.
There is, however, a '10-day escape
clause that can be utilized, but only it ad
min ist ration is pressured into changing its
stance. I'd like to repeat the community
leaders and organizers' joint letter
("Protest organizers justify actions, call lor
further support"): "the issues that we are
fighting for remain unaddrcssed." To all
those who have been inspired to the cause
of labor justice, I hope you work to effect
c hange with whatever non-violent means
you choose.

Reading Friday's Daily and the opin
ions section, I am struck by how the paper
is joining with the University in minimiz
ing the significance of the subcontracting

issue. I was also struck by the clear hi.is in
the opinions sec tion toward criticizing and
slandering the efforts of a protesting
group of students who believe in a cause.
The Daily printed two long and malicious
letters to the editor while tailing to print an
opinion In students strongly supporting
the cause.
Hy printing such long and hateful let
ters to the editor, taking up practically
one-third of the opinions page plus the ed
itorial. the paper is clearly not being a non
partisan participant in the dialogue.
I he Daily could have easily written an
otliei story more deeply outlining the
spec ilics about the subcontracting issue to
better inform the Stanford community
about what is going on in the hospital and
how that would ailed individual lives. I
also think The Daily could have given the
protesters more coverage in the paper.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
On tlw ex>ening oj Thursday, Nov. 2 I K I he
Daily's Opinions stuff laid out eveiy letter it re
ceived before 10 p.m. regarding the subcontract
ing issue and protest tluit afternoon. After that
point in time, a representative of the groups that or
ganized the protest contacted us /n telephone, re
questing that we extentl our Opinions deadline to
accomtxltite an addUumtd letter.
We com filled villi this request, printing the let
ter headlined "Protest organizers justify action,
call for further sufrfHrrt," and signed In leaders
and organizers from MEChA, PASU, SAAAC,
SCTJ, SEAS and SI AC.
1 would like to |k»ini out the bias in The
Daily 's article on the rally against subcon
tracting and the choice to sensationalize the
issue rather than focus on pertinent infor
mation. The structure of the news article it
self (I lospital / Administrative arguments,
the students' account, and then Hospital/
Administrative rebuttal) betrays this bias.
Furthermore, we did not "force our way"
into Saksen's office, we simply walked in. We
were Ibllc wing Saksen into a room, while he
walked away from us, when the door was
dosed on the student's arm. More impor
tantly, we all need to de-emphasize the sen
sationalist descriptions of what happened in
the hospital. It takes away from what's im
portant: the workers who will suffer from
sulxontracting and the decision makers
who can prevent it.
I lie ac cusations in the letters to the edi
tor .ire based purely on hearsay and partic
ular!) absurd. I am speaking of the letters
that was written by an undeclared fresh
man who has been on campus tor one
quarter and a sophomore who says that the
widely circulated e-mail I wrote represents
"modern media," whatever that means.
I hese letters were written even before 1 he
Daily came out, which means there was no
official or reliable source of information for
the events that occurred at all, only ru
mors. yet the authors still felt qualified to
write about the events as if they witnessed
the events personally.
This resulted in broad, nonsensical as
sumptions that have no support. I ac knowl
edge that inv e-mail, which was written in 15
minutes during the middle of the rally,
added to confusion, but it is no justification
lor ii rational, (insupportable judgements or
refusing to wait and line! out the tacts. For
instance, one letter assumes students were
arrested tor "breaking and entering," while
the other points towards "Ibrced entry."
For these reasons and many others, 1
found The Daily's coverage of the protest to
Ik- irresponsible. Hie contract has been
signed. Ten workers are earning poverty
wages, vet The Daily thinks that getting a
ti(ket lor trespassing, a common result ot
peaceful (ivil disobedience, is too extreme.
The Daily is simultaneously advocating
against an injustice and against doing some
thing "ellective" about it.
OWEN LI
ptnurr, Asuin-Anuruwn Slutltes
As the campaign against subcontracting
escalates, I believe it's essential that the Stan
lord community remain focused not only
on the issue at hand but also on its broader
implications.
As a coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Justice At Stanford, I am well
aware of the pattern of neglectful policies
the Stanford I lospital has directed at low -in
come communities of color. During SEAS's
Medical Waste ('.ampaign, students success
tully fought to stop the hospital from send
ing its dioxin-produt ing waste to an incin
erator in ()akland. A 1994 EPA report con
firmed that dioxin promotes cancer, can
cause severe reproductive and develop
mental problems, can damage the immune
system and can interfere with regulatory
hormones.
So I ask: why would a hospital of all places
knowingly contribute to dioxin production,
given the severe health threat that it poses?
Does cost minimization justify the exploita
tion of people and the environment? And is
it morally acceptable to exploit those who do
not even have the political clout to defend
themselves?
It was not until students voiced their
concerns that the hospital agreed to adopt
a safer method of medical waste disposal.

Now the hospital has signed a com rat t to
subcontract jobs, meaning lower wages,
fewer benefits and compromised sanita
tion at the hospital (due to (lit- inevitable
inexperience of lower paid, temporary
workers). Yet again, hospital administra
tors are avoiding accountability tor their
actions because there is no moral ground
to support their stance.
[list as the resit lent so! Oakland sought
help in their light to eliminate <li< >\m lie>m
their neighborhoods, workers now seek our
help to tight lor lair labor standards. I ea
gerly await the day when unjust policies will
not Ik- implemented in the lirst place. In the
meantime, we should speak out for the
rights of others, rights that have been de
nied in the name ol economic s.
Whether vour pretet red jargon is politi
cal, spiritual, philosophical or other, the
tcncts of t ivit dutv, compassion, just it e, and
basic human deccnc\ all boil down to one
thing: moral progress. ()urstx ietv could use
some. As students at a prestigious universi
ty, we have a powerful opportunit\ and a se
rious responsibility to bridge the gap be
tween decision-makers and the affected. We
can promote antl engage in meaningful ex
changes that will result in a more enlight
ened, unified and consensual six ietv.

occurrences t>l Ii itla\ antl lurthei more to
demantl the resignation ol Lou Saksen,
Stanford Hospital's \ it t* President of
General Services. I am not representing
any organization through ibis letter, but
my own views.
On I hursdav, six Stanford student
leaders were arrested loi peacefully
protesting an injustice: non-union, low
accountability, low wage, no-benelit sul>-
contrat ling that would allow the Stanford
I lospital to "t lean its hands" from part it i
pation in the exploitation ol predomi
nantly Black, Asian antl Latino workers.
We can not allow the I lospital nor the ad
ministration to pretend it has no respon
sibility in this matter. I liev do!
On Friday, more than 100 students
gathered around the hospital in ordei to
demantl a meeting with Saksen, who
presently lias the livelihood ol at least 10
workers in his hands. I hey sought the op
portunity as Stanford community mem
bers to express their views about his im
pending decision to begin the process of
non-union subcontracting, which toiild
potentially ailed I 10 nioie hospital work
ers and set a precedent not only at Stanford
but other universities to develop the same
unfair hiring prat (ires.
Light students entered the hospital and
after Saksen refused to meet with tlieni,
were accosted, harrassed antl forcefully re
moved by Lou Saksen's bouncers — unau
thorized layv enforcement officers. I he po
lite then had to free these students from
these bouncers before they could even ar
rest them. Six students were ai rested.
Afterwards, more than 150 students
gathered outside of the office of I niveisity
President |ohn I lennessy in order to de
mand the release of 'these six students and to
the end of non-union siibt out rat ting ai
Stanford. For yvhatevei reasons, we t lit I not
see I lennessy nor heai li< >\n hew as g< >iilg to
ileal witli this problem. Ii seems that per
haps he is not fully aware of what has ot
t lin ed today and what lias been happening
throughout this "Stop Subcontracting"
campaign.
In the past weeks, the members ol the
Stanford Labor Action C.oalition had
hoped to be able to come to a laii agree
ment com crning fair hii ing pt at tit rs with
Saksen. If not, they hoped to stop the mo
tion to begin sulx ontrai ling antl ai least in
volve more of the people directly affected
by it in the decision-making process. I his
has not happened, and wit I i the at lions In
Saksen and his bouncers, ii is clear that it
will not happen willi him in the seat ol
power, nor without a fairer sy stem of liu ing
at the Stanford 1 lospital.
One man should not have full decision
making poyver. Workers antl concerned
Stanford community nientbei s should have
a say. And if our voice yvill in>t be heard t >r re
spected through traditional means then
they must anil will be heart I thiough means
of our own devising.
Fvery individual who witnessed what oc
curred on Friday should and must at the
very least voice their opinion directly to
those who have poyver over this situation,
Saksen and Hennessy. Do not keep your
outrage or your opinions to yourself. Do not
depend on other students to voice your
opinion for you. It is an unfair burden that
they as students should not have to bear. I
have witnessed several extremely intelli
gent and talented individuals who have
been involved in this campaign from the
beginning deteriorate emotionally from
trying to battle the in justices that the I ni
versity — that they pay money to attend
— allows within itself. Ii is the responsi
bility of the University to allow us to be
students without the guilt that we arc
somehow participating antl perpetuating
a system of exploitation. Some students,
like myself I must admit, can at times ig
nore this fact. Others, like those involved
in this campaign, cannot, antl their aca
demic performance and motivation have

suffered.
I hold 11 it* Stanford administration re
sponsible lot this and demand that mea
sures be taken to change this. We can
begin by establishing fail hiring practices
at the University that do not depend tin
the exploitation ol people of color and
workers unable or afraid to unionize as a
result of this system of subcontracting.

"Going about it the wrong yvay." 1 his
is more than the sentiments expressed in
Friday's editorial, regarding the student
protest against unfair labor practices, it
seems to be the buz/ phrase going
around campus.
| unit>r Monica I letiesiioza tloyvnplaved
the sensationalism ol the event in her quote
yesterday to I lie Daily. I lie editorial
11 limed in: "If the protesters' pin pose was to
gain attention, they succeeded." Well,
amen. I hey can talk about the issues antl
the fundamentals antl the cornet stones anil
precedents of their actions yesterday, but
the whole scenario sinkcs me as the most
sexy, scandalous, sensational action on this
campus in years. May be decades. Bravo.
I he danger, of course, is not being able
to eflect positive change as a result of sensa
tional action. But I think positive change
was elici ted. I low many of lis gave a damn
about laboi sulx'ontractiug before yester
day ? Antl even though niosi of us still don't
give a damn enough to do anything materi
al, at least we can lend our opinion one yvay

serves us to realize the liu I that we live in a
yvorltlol just ices and injustices, antl that hay
ing a slant! is pei haps more human than not
hay ing one al all.
So, I commend yesterday's protesters.
Don't be lools: the hospital is still going to
subcontract. Thank you, though, lor hav

break the law antl inconvenience your

i am not sure yvhat was more illustrative,
the events of Thursday at the medical (en
ter, or the response as represented by the
letters and editorial of I lie Daily on Friday.
What is it illustrative of? It is yet another
event litre al Stanford that punt tuates the
lad that most ol the students here would
like to picture themselves as the tut in e bro
kers ol power and those that would be in a
position of authority , anil as such have a
built in ability antl tendency to empathize
with that perspective.
Fo condemn a brave young woman,
who had the determination to attempt to
get Stanford to enforce a more responsi
ble labor polity , is the product of an ex
pet lation that we .is Stan fort I students will
be in positions to broker power and in po
sitions of authority. We as students are
quit k to empathize with those already in
poyver for reasons that the readers can
hash out on their own.
May junior Monica llenestroza be
blessed forever lot attempting lo help real
people, yvith real families, who are dealing
with the real ellects ol the rising costs ol liv

knowinglv sacrificing her dean criminal
record and her arm for these real people.
May she be blessed for not forgetting that
though it may not have been tlieii intention,
the ultimate result of people yvho sullered
and died for us is that students like us could
live privileged lives and be here at Stanford.

Junior. Ilislory is lliolog\
I here is a very basic concept, essen
tial to the practice of democracy antl the
protection of our t ivil liberties, called
civil disobedience. Imagine, fora mo
ment, where our country would be
without the actions and events that took
place flut ing the civil rights movement.
The scenarios are somewhat different,
but the similarities are what is impor
tant here. What would the letters to the
editor say, looking back on history in
those cases.
From what I understand, the issues that
are at the heart of this matter arc long-stand
ingones. Dialogue (at the very least attempts
at it) and educational dibits have been at
tempted by the very organizers who were
recently arrested and the groups to which
they belong. I hose hospital officials who at e
making the decisions are certainly entitled
to ilo so, in accordance with their own lx--
liels, but would it hurt lot there to be some
greater examination "of the lints?" Would a
multi-liltetcd locus group, whose purpose
would lx' to examine relevant issues in all
lights, be a bad thing?
Perhaps the students who were arrested
made some mistakes in the physical vehe
ment e with which they protested. Mob rule
should not lx- allowed to lx- a controlling
force, but I do not think that this is the most
important element tollix i discussed here. ll'

we continue to allow 11 u * l<x ,il point of our
public dist ourse to fx-then mistakes, then I
believe that we have fallen prex lo 0111 own

I'm inclined to believe tli.it main ol us

those idealisti( protesting groups. Perhaps
we were 100 bus\ with job interviews and
end-of-terin projects, oi max be (just m«i\ 1 k-)
soineol us pist didn't agree.
Perhaps x\e shouldn't be content to let
history repeat it.sell here. I .el's turn this

Reactions to Thursday's protest
I here has been much misinformation
i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula
tions. In these instances, rules ol fairness,
honesty, and respect lor the rights of others
will govern our conduct at all times. Kxpe
diencA should never compromise integri
ty." Muse lolt\ c laims are ridiculously far
from the reality.
Indeed, Stanford needs to c hallenge its
own hypocrisy and ensure that all workers
on campus are treated lairlv, honestly, and
with res pec t with .1 li\ing wage, lull Ix'nefits
.lnd union protection. And until Stanford
recognizes the important e ol respec ting the
voice and the rights ol workers, we assure
you that this movement will not cease. We
urge the community to continue support
ing this issue until justice is won.

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan
lord I lospital ("Protesters' behavior
hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem
bers ol all these organizations, was to hold
Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
vices I.ou Saksen accountable to this com
munity, not necessarily to convince him
that subcontracting was unjust. The need
for such action was urgent. Saksen had re
peatedly demonstrated indifference to the
issue and planned, in I lie Daily's words,
"to sign a contract to outsource the posi
tions as soon as possible."
II the editors possess a distorted ac
count ot the events, they are probably not
alone. I lie Daily lot its part, contributed
to public misunderstanding bv framing
their (overage ol the event in a biased
manner. I he Daily does not a present a
students' account ol the events. It men
lions onl\ the students' opinion tli.it the\
were conscious ol patients and their view
of an incident that resulted in an injury
(two of the students, I will pedantically
point out, were not inside the hospital, as
the article claims). Students either were
not given a ( hance to respond to the accu
sation tli.it they "Ibrced their wa\ into the
administrative offices" and "became phys
ical with hospital personnel and verbally
abused them." or else tli.it response was
consigned to the journalistic dustbin.
Student accounts present a ver\ differ
ent picture from the one a reader would
glean from I lie Daily. I lie students en
tered peacefully and asked to meet with
Saksen. I hey waited for Saksen to con
clude <i meeting, during which time one ol
the students entered an adjacent physi
cians' lounge to inform them ol their pur
pose and | >l.in and added that they did not
wish to disturb them but that they were
welcome to join. When Saksen appeared,
the student spokesperson presented the
group's demand that he stop subconiract
ing, talk to the student delegation or ad
dress the protesters outside. Saksen re
fused to discuss the issue further with the
students and walked away.
1 lie students followed him until he en
tered not an ollice but a public lounge and
he c losed tlie dooi behind him. I lie sec u
rity guards then tried to physically remove
them. 1 he police, upon arrival, informed
security personnel that it was illegal lor the
guards to use physical tone to remove stu
dents without lit st dec laring a citizen's ar
rest. A citizen's arrest was then dec lared,
and the students were given the c hoice to
leave or be arrested. 1 hey chose the latter.
rhus, to continue to believe, as the edi
tors did, that the students were "forcing
their way intoan ollice . . . and making ex -
plic it demands." is to accept one version of
the events and to deny the validity of the
other. New, what all of us do agree upon is
that the students were arrested lor tres
passing, one of the most frequent disobe
dience techniques employed by non-vio
lent social movements. II the campaign to
end subcontlading is'extremist" tor tics
passing in order to impress upon Saksen
and the university administration the ur
gency of this issue, then so were the 54
protesters arrested for occupying Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's ollice in order to
issue demands relating to multicultural
life at Stanford. Like Thursday's
protesters, these students had met with
administrative indifference, in this case,
loi years. II last week's protesters were
"out ol line," so were the 294 students that
were arrested lor refusing to leave Old
I'nion in 11 >77. in oiclei to protest Stan
lord's links to corporations invested in
apartheid South Africa. I ike the protest last
1 hursclav, this was part of a year-long ethi
cal ic >n and ac tivist campaign.
I he history ol activism suggests that
these ac lions, whic li the editors may deem
"neither appropriate nor consti uc live," arc
taken only alter other channels are exhaust
ed and the administration continually
proves to be negligent and non-cooperative.
1 )ue to I hursday's protest, the adminis
tration has agreed to arrange a meeting be
tween students antl 1 diversity President
|ohn Ilcnnessv, Provost |ohn Etcheineiidy
and Saksen on Wednesday. I he I Diversity
administration conceded this only after a
team ol student delegates negotiated with
ollicials tor several hours alter the six stu
dents at the hospital were arrested. I lowev
er, the meeting is closed, and as ol the writ
ing of this letter, the administration ictuses
to allow workers to attend, thus demon
strating further indillercncc towards this
issue. Saksen, in signing the agreement sub
conirac ting 10 housekeeping positions, has
taken a step towards a policy subcontract
ing that could ailed 440 positions without
adopting a living wage position.
There is, however, a '10-day escape
clause that can be utilized, but only it ad
min ist ration is pressured into changing its
stance. I'd like to repeat the community
leaders and organizers' joint letter
("Protest organizers justify actions, call lor
further support"): "the issues that we are
fighting for remain unaddrcssed." To all
those who have been inspired to the cause
of labor justice, I hope you work to effect
c hange with whatever non-violent means
you choose.

Reading Friday's Daily and the opin
ions section, I am struck by how the paper
is joining with the University in minimiz
ing the significance of the subcontracting

issue. I was also struck by the clear hi.is in
the opinions sec tion toward criticizing and
slandering the efforts of a protesting
group of students who believe in a cause.
The Daily printed two long and malicious
letters to the editor while tailing to print an
opinion In students strongly supporting
the cause.
Hy printing such long and hateful let
ters to the editor, taking up practically
one-third of the opinions page plus the ed
itorial. the paper is clearly not being a non
partisan participant in the dialogue.
I he Daily could have easily written an
otliei story more deeply outlining the
spec ilics about the subcontracting issue to
better inform the Stanford community
about what is going on in the hospital and
how that would ailed individual lives. I
also think The Daily could have given the
protesters more coverage in the paper.

EDITOR'S NOTE:
On tlw ex>ening oj Thursday, Nov. 2 I K I he
Daily's Opinions stuff laid out eveiy letter it re
ceived before 10 p.m. regarding the subcontract
ing issue and protest tluit afternoon. After that
point in time, a representative of the groups that or
ganized the protest contacted us /n telephone, re
questing that we extentl our Opinions deadline to
accomtxltite an addUumtd letter.
We com filled villi this request, printing the let
ter headlined "Protest organizers justify action,
call for further sufrfHrrt," and signed In leaders
and organizers from MEChA, PASU, SAAAC,
SCTJ, SEAS and SI AC.
1 would like to |k»ini out the bias in The
Daily 's article on the rally against subcon
tracting and the choice to sensationalize the
issue rather than focus on pertinent infor
mation. The structure of the news article it
self (I lospital / Administrative arguments,
the students' account, and then Hospital/
Administrative rebuttal) betrays this bias.
Furthermore, we did not "force our way"
into Saksen's office, we simply walked in. We
were Ibllc wing Saksen into a room, while he
walked away from us, when the door was
dosed on the student's arm. More impor
tantly, we all need to de-emphasize the sen
sationalist descriptions of what happened in
the hospital. It takes away from what's im
portant: the workers who will suffer from
sulxontracting and the decision makers
who can prevent it.
I lie ac cusations in the letters to the edi
tor .ire based purely on hearsay and partic
ular!) absurd. I am speaking of the letters
that was written by an undeclared fresh
man who has been on campus tor one
quarter and a sophomore who says that the
widely circulated e-mail I wrote represents
"modern media," whatever that means.
I hese letters were written even before 1 he
Daily came out, which means there was no
official or reliable source of information for
the events that occurred at all, only ru
mors. yet the authors still felt qualified to
write about the events as if they witnessed
the events personally.
This resulted in broad, nonsensical as
sumptions that have no support. I ac knowl
edge that inv e-mail, which was written in 15
minutes during the middle of the rally,
added to confusion, but it is no justification
lor ii rational, (insupportable judgements or
refusing to wait and line! out the tacts. For
instance, one letter assumes students were
arrested tor "breaking and entering," while
the other points towards "Ibrced entry."
For these reasons and many others, 1
found The Daily's coverage of the protest to
Ik- irresponsible. Hie contract has been
signed. Ten workers are earning poverty
wages, vet The Daily thinks that getting a
ti(ket lor trespassing, a common result ot
peaceful (ivil disobedience, is too extreme.
The Daily is simultaneously advocating
against an injustice and against doing some
thing "ellective" about it.
OWEN LI
ptnurr, Asuin-Anuruwn Slutltes
As the campaign against subcontracting
escalates, I believe it's essential that the Stan
lord community remain focused not only
on the issue at hand but also on its broader
implications.
As a coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Justice At Stanford, I am well
aware of the pattern of neglectful policies
the Stanford I lospital has directed at low -in
come communities of color. During SEAS's
Medical Waste ('.ampaign, students success
tully fought to stop the hospital from send
ing its dioxin-produt ing waste to an incin
erator in ()akland. A 1994 EPA report con
firmed that dioxin promotes cancer, can
cause severe reproductive and develop
mental problems, can damage the immune
system and can interfere with regulatory
hormones.
So I ask: why would a hospital of all places
knowingly contribute to dioxin production,
given the severe health threat that it poses?
Does cost minimization justify the exploita
tion of people and the environment? And is
it morally acceptable to exploit those who do
not even have the political clout to defend
themselves?
It was not until students voiced their
concerns that the hospital agreed to adopt
a safer method of medical waste disposal.

Now the hospital has signed a com rat t to
subcontract jobs, meaning lower wages,
fewer benefits and compromised sanita
tion at the hospital (due to (lit- inevitable
inexperience of lower paid, temporary
workers). Yet again, hospital administra
tors are avoiding accountability tor their
actions because there is no moral ground
to support their stance.
[list as the resit lent so! Oakland sought
help in their light to eliminate <li< >\m lie>m
their neighborhoods, workers now seek our
help to tight lor lair labor standards. I ea
gerly await the day when unjust policies will
not Ik- implemented in the lirst place. In the
meantime, we should speak out for the
rights of others, rights that have been de
nied in the name ol economic s.
Whether vour pretet red jargon is politi
cal, spiritual, philosophical or other, the
tcncts of t ivit dutv, compassion, just it e, and
basic human deccnc\ all boil down to one
thing: moral progress. ()urstx ietv could use
some. As students at a prestigious universi
ty, we have a powerful opportunit\ and a se
rious responsibility to bridge the gap be
tween decision-makers and the affected. We
can promote antl engage in meaningful ex
changes that will result in a more enlight
ened, unified and consensual six ietv.

1 am writing this letter in ordei It) ex
press ni\ ow 11 pet sonal outrage about the
occurrences t>l Ii itla\ antl lurthei more to
demantl the resignation ol Lou Saksen,
Stanford Hospital's \ it t* President of
General Services. I am not representing
any organization through ibis letter, but
my own views.
On I hursdav, six Stanford student
leaders were arrested loi peacefully
protesting an injustice: non-union, low
accountability, low wage, no-benelit sul>-
contrat ling that would allow the Stanford
I lospital to "t lean its hands" from part it i
pation in the exploitation ol predomi
nantly Black, Asian antl Latino workers.
We can not allow the I lospital nor the ad
ministration to pretend it has no respon
sibility in this matter. I liev do!
On Friday, more than 100 students
gathered around the hospital in ordei to
demantl a meeting with Saksen, who
presently lias the livelihood ol at least 10
workers in his hands. I hey sought the op
portunity as Stanford community mem
bers to express their views about his im
pending decision to begin the process of
non-union subcontracting, which toiild
potentially ailed I 10 nioie hospital work
ers and set a precedent not only at Stanford
but other universities to develop the same
unfair hiring prat (ires.
Light students entered the hospital and
after Saksen refused to meet with tlieni,
were accosted, harrassed antl forcefully re
moved by Lou Saksen's bouncers — unau
thorized layv enforcement officers. I he po
lite then had to free these students from
these bouncers before they could even ar
rest them. Six students were ai rested.
Afterwards, more than 150 students
gathered outside of the office of I niveisity
President |ohn I lennessy in order to de
mand the release of 'these six students and to
the end of non-union siibt out rat ting ai
Stanford. For yvhatevei reasons, we t lit I not
see I lennessy nor heai li< >\n hew as g< >iilg to
ileal witli this problem. Ii seems that per
haps he is not fully aware of what has ot
t lin ed today and what lias been happening
throughout this "Stop Subcontracting"
campaign.
In the past weeks, the members ol the
Stanford Labor Action C.oalition had
hoped to be able to come to a laii agree
ment com crning fair hii ing pt at tit rs with
Saksen. If not, they hoped to stop the mo
tion to begin sulx ontrai ling antl ai least in
volve more of the people directly affected
by it in the decision-making process. I his
has not happened, and wit I i the at lions In
Saksen and his bouncers, ii is clear that it
will not happen willi him in the seat ol
power, nor without a fairer sy stem of liu ing
at the Stanford 1 lospital.
One man should not have full decision
making poyver. Workers antl concerned
Stanford community nientbei s should have
a say. And if our voice yvill in>t be heard t >r re
spected through traditional means then
they must anil will be heart I thiough means
of our own devising.
Fvery individual who witnessed what oc
curred on Friday should and must at the
very least voice their opinion directly to
those who have poyver over this situation,
Saksen and Hennessy. Do not keep your
outrage or your opinions to yourself. Do not
depend on other students to voice your
opinion for you. It is an unfair burden that
they as students should not have to bear. I
have witnessed several extremely intelli
gent and talented individuals who have
been involved in this campaign from the
beginning deteriorate emotionally from
trying to battle the in justices that the I ni
versity — that they pay money to attend
— allows within itself. Ii is the responsi
bility of the University to allow us to be
students without the guilt that we arc
somehow participating antl perpetuating
a system of exploitation. Some students,
like myself I must admit, can at times ig
nore this fact. Others, like those involved
in this campaign, cannot, antl their aca
demic performance and motivation have

suffered.
I hold 11 it* Stanford administration re
sponsible lot this and demand that mea
sures be taken to change this. We can
begin by establishing fail hiring practices
at the University that do not depend tin
the exploitation ol people of color and
workers unable or afraid to unionize as a
result of this system of subcontracting.

the fundamentals antl the cornet stones anil
precedents of their actions yesterday, but
the whole scenario sinkcs me as the most
sexy, scandalous, sensational action on this
campus in years. May be decades. Bravo.
I he danger, of course, is not being able
to eflect positive change as a result of sensa
tional action. But I think positive change
was elici ted. I low many of lis gave a damn
about laboi sulx'ontractiug before yester
day ? Antl even though niosi of us still don't
give a damn enough to do anything materi
al, at least we can lend our opinion one yvay
or llii' other. A little row now and again
serves us to realize the liu I that we live in a
yvorltlol just ices and injustices, antl that hay
ing a slant! is pei haps more human than not
hay ing one al all.
So, I commend yesterday's protesters.
Don't be lools: the hospital is still going to
subcontract. Thank you, though, lor hav
ing the temerity to challenge authority,
break the law antl inconvenience your
selves lor a cause. I think the I niversitv is
ultimately better for it.

i am not sure yvhat was more illustrative,
the events of Thursday at the medical (en
ter, or the response as represented by the
letters and editorial of I lie Daily on Friday.
What is it illustrative of? It is yet another
event litre al Stanford that punt tuates the
lad that most ol the students here would
like to picture themselves as the tut in e bro
kers ol power and those that would be in a
position of authority , anil as such have a
built in ability antl tendency to empathize
with that perspective.
Fo condemn a brave young woman,
who had the determination to attempt to
get Stanford to enforce a more responsi
ble labor polity , is the product of an ex
pet lation that we .is Stan fort I students will
be in positions to broker power and in po
sitions of authority. We as students are
quit k to empathize with those already in
poyver for reasons that the readers can
hash out on their own.
May junior Monica llenestroza be
blessed forever lot attempting lo help real
people, yvith real families, who are dealing
with the real ellects ol the rising costs ol liv
ing. May she be blessed foi knowingly or un
knowinglv sacrificing her dean criminal
record and her arm for these real people.
May she be blessed for not forgetting that
though it may not have been tlieii intention,
the ultimate result of people yvho sullered
and died for us is that students like us could
live privileged lives and be here at Stanford.
Mav we iecognize the intelligent eol a sacri

Junior. Ilislory is lliolog\
I here is a very basic concept, essen
tial to the practice of democracy antl the
protection of our t ivil liberties, called
civil disobedience. Imagine, fora mo
ment, where our country would be
without the actions and events that took
place flut ing the civil rights movement.
The scenarios are somewhat different,
but the similarities are what is impor
tant here. What would the letters to the
editor say, looking back on history in
those cases.
From what I understand, the issues that
are at the heart of this matter arc long-stand
ingones. Dialogue (at the very least attempts
at it) and educational dibits have been at
tempted by the very organizers who were
recently arrested and the groups to which
they belong. I hose hospital officials who at e
making the decisions are certainly entitled
to ilo so, in accordance with their own lx--
liels, but would it hurt lot there to be some
greater examination "of the lints?" Would a
multi-liltetcd locus group, whose purpose
would lx' to examine relevant issues in all
lights, be a bad thing?
Perhaps the students who were arrested
made some mistakes in the physical vehe
ment e with which they protested. Mob rule
should not lx- allowed to lx- a controlling
force, but I do not think that this is the most
important element tollix i discussed here. ll'

we continue to allow 11 u * l<x ,il point of our
public dist ourse to fx-then mistakes, then I
believe that we have fallen prex lo 0111 own
ignorant e 01 loll\.
I'm inclined to believe tli.it main ol us
did not examine (he information tli.it these
student groups tried to ediu.ite us a!>out
(well belot e the protest o< < m red). I be in
formation might have been dismissed out
of-hand as just loddci froitianoihci one of
those idealisti( protesting groups. Perhaps
we were 100 bus\ with job interviews and
end-of-terin projects, oi max be (just m«i\ 1 k-)
soineol us pist didn't agree.
Perhaps x\e shouldn't be content to let
history repeat it.sell here. I .el's turn this
negative attention into .in opportunity lo
learn. Let's not get Mink judging the ac
tions ol those who liaxe actuallx entered
the fray.
