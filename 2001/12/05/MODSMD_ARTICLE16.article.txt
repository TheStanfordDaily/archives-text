Reactions to Thursday's protest
I here has been much misinformation
i it* dialing about the recent I hursdax ac
tion against sulx ontrat ting at the Stanford
Ik ispital. Manx people have questioned our
i not ix at ions and out their t.u lies in address
ing ibis issue. Before anx meaningful dis
( ussi< »n i an lake place about how to (ontiti
ne this campaign, we feel that these niiscon
< eptions must be clarified.
I n sd\, ii is important to emphasize that
i Ins c anipaign against the siilx out ratting of
ten janitorial positions at (lie Stanford hos
pital is a union < anipaign that has been in at -
lion since |ulx of this year when the hospital
first announced the move to sulx out rac I out
the positions. fxxal 715. the I nited Stan
ford Workers, has been mobilizing hospital
janitors and holding rallies of their oxvn to
fight this issue. Afier constant frustration
from the indifference of hospital adminis
tration, students were asked bx the union to
help lend our support.
I he reason that the assistance of students
and.m particular, the Stanford 1-abor Ac
tion ( >alition, was requested bx the union is
because for the past three years, students
from SI „\( liaxe been working closely with
xvorkeis on their issues. We helped to win
the right to unionize for these same hospital
janitors two years ago, along xvith working
on the Justice for Janitors campaign and
(Yintract renegotiations for Hon Appetite
workers. This is just one rally, one campaign
in a long series of worker-student actions to
t rx and increase accountability towards
xvorkei s at Stanford University.
I nloilutiately, the has action has lieen
inaccurately and harmfully represented as
the act of "radical" students who were all of
a sudden involved in this issue concerning
workers alNHit which they did not have ade
quate information and on which they tlid
not appropriately represent. Most of stu
dent arrested were students of color, most
from backgrounds similar to those of the
workers they are fighting with. We are all

people xvlio are committed to this xvorker
student movement and have shown our
dedication through our time, our energy,
and our consistency.
Also, maiix people seem to hold the false
opinion that the students who were arrested
were "over-aggressive" and "irrational" in
theirajipr'oach and tactics-—that the arrests
were just flamboyant means of getting at
tention for themselves and not necessarily
for (he campaign. This is due to a lackof un
derstanding of the history of interaction be
tween at I mil list rat ion, xvorkersand students
on this specific issue.
W'e repeatedlx tried to get meetings xvith
1 nixersitx President John 1 fennessv about
this issue but xvere consistently denied those
meetings and were instead delegated to
lower-lex el administrators, such as Spec ial
Assistant to the President JeffA Vaciitcl, xvlio
have no power to make any decisions in this
issue. I lie administrators we xvere able to
meet xvith, W'achtcl and Lou Saksen, Vice
President for (ieneral Services of the Stan
ford I lospital and (llinics, did not respond
lo our demand, which was to stop the sub
contracting of the ten janitorial positions
until a committee could be created to review
university lal>or policy, in an acceptable
manner. I hey lx>th absolutely refused to
consider the propositi even though literally
hundreds of students, faculty, medical stall
and workers signed petitions and made per
sonal phone calls.
In addition, the Ix-havior, arguments,
and attitude of administrators have thus tar
Ixxmi xen offensive. W hen asked if they
thought subcontractors exploit their work
ers by only paying (hem $8-9 an hour,
W'achtcl replied that people "choose to
work" for sulx ontrat tors and Saksen said
that since the xvorkeis are still lixing and
working they are "obviously surviving" on
their low xvages. From our research and in
let anion with xvorkeis, we know that main
xvorkeis must hold two jobs just to support
their families.
We xvere discouraged I hat in the face of
such glaring economic inequality, the ad
ministration fell back upon unsubstantiat
ed arguments.
(lonsec|i lently, we felt that t he t >nlx way t< >
get it response from the administration lx--
fore that Friday, which was the deadline for
the contract to be signed, was to do a peace
ful sit-in at Saksen's office and demand that
he slop (he sulx ontrat ting. W'e honestly felt
that this was the only way that this universi
ty xvoultl take* the concerns of workers and
students seriously. Even though students
were not only arrested, but also assaulted by
security guards and by Saksen himself, this
tltx-s not and xvill not deter us from continu
ing with this campaign. Such tactics only
serve to further empower this movement.
I he refusal to recognize workers as a
part of the Stanford community is further
emphasized by the fact at the upcoming
scheduled I hursday meeting with adminis
tration, President Hennessy and Provost
Ktchemendy absolutely REFUSE to meet
with workers. When asked why the xvill not
speak directly with workers, neither admin
istrator had a response. If true and sincere
change is to be made, how can it Ix- made
when the workers who are going to lie af

fected (.urn*>i even sil .11 the same tal»lf with
administration? II the intention ol 11 it' Stan
lord administration is to truly <liange lalx>t
poli( \.it Stanford then the first change that
must cxcur is that workers arc welcomed
into this dialogue.
Stanford University must be held ac
countable for the conditions of labor for
their workers, whether directly hired or
subcontracted. Stanford's own current
Libor ( ode of Conduct states that "Fre
quently, Stanford's business activities are
not the subject ol specific laws 01 regula
tions. In these instances, rules ol fairness,
honesty, and respect lor the rights of others
will govern our conduct at all times. Kxpe
diencA should never compromise integri
ty." Muse lolt\ c laims are ridiculously far
from the reality.
Indeed, Stanford needs to c hallenge its
own hypocrisy and ensure that all workers
on campus are treated lairlv, honestly, and
with res pec t with .1 li\ing wage, lull Ix'nefits
.lnd union protection. And until Stanford
recognizes the important e ol respec ting the
voice and the rights ol workers, we assure
you that this movement will not cease. We
urge the community to continue support
ing this issue until justice is won.

I iist Iridav, tour editors ol l'lie Daily
wrote .in editorial on I hursday's protest
against the sulx ontrac tingof jobsat Stan

hurts themselves and cause"). I lie edito
rial bet raved a lat k ol knowledge regard
ing the nature ol the protest and cam
paign. "II the goal ol t lie protesters was to
garner support for their cause among
students, they wrote, "the best way to re
alize that would have been through the
dissemination ol information and pro
motion of dialogue."
In fact, support had already been gar
nered. Ihe Student Labor Action Coali
tion brought this about through, as the ed
itors themselves a< knowledge, "a series of
campus-wide events," though these events
were merely the most recent manifesta
tions of a campaign that began a year ago.
As Ihe Daily itself reported on Nov. 29,
the ASSI endorsed SLAC' s labor justice
campaign. In that article, ASSU Senator
Nick Rodriguez is quoted as saving, "This
is something that the students care deeply
about. I lie campaign was supported by
several student groups, the hospital work
ers and union organizers. The primary
goal of the protest, which involved mem

Hospital Vice President ol General Ser
