# TWO GUYS WHO ARE BETTER THAN YOU
## Bitter rivals, sweet revenge 
### 
In 19M Snoop Doggy Dogg and his
friendly cohort Dr. Dre said, ".But I,
somehow, some way, keep coming
up with funky-ass s — like every sin
gle day.' We spent 1(> hours trying to twist
ili.u statement to relate to our column, but
then we realized that it has never, ever
been called "funky-ass" anything, nor
have we ever been accused of being a
physician rapper.
However, we did consult our under
world sources (props, Yik) and discov
ered that another one of Snoop's friends,
one I upar (west side) had a longstand-

ing rivalry with east
toast rapper Notorious
B I G. While things
might not have worked
out for everyone in
volved. the hate between
the two allowed them to
draw attention to the
plight of their (lompton
hos, while selling mil-

lions of albums highlighting their inter
state rivalry. Upon closer inspection, the
value of such a rivalry is perhaps most
important in discovering a way to funda
mentally improve your existence.
Rivalries exist everywhere. Think
about it: look to your left and right. Odds
are at least one person secretly hates you.
And at ever) level of society, rivalries serve
to focus anger and negativity to generally
enhance evervone's lives. For example, at
the national level, we hated Russia during
the Cold War. 1 hey were our rivals, see?
On an institutional level, most organiza
tions detest another firm or group
enough to call them their rival. Stanford
and Berkeley do it.and so do Coke and
I'epsi. For individuals, think about Hamil
ton and Burr, Magic Johnson and Larry
Bird or Britney and Christina. Oh Jesus,
we think of those last two every night.
While other people might avoid life
long rivalries or enemies, we embrace
them. But why would you want yet an
other enemy when your roommate and
probably your parents already hate you?
1 he short answer is that everybody needs
a scapegoat, because when things go
wrong, there's no reason you should take
the blame.
It doesn't matter what the situation is.

Failed a final? Forgot to double-check your
partner's parachute? Pushed somebody in
front of a speeding train? |ust blame your
newfound rival.
To be clear, "rival" implies a reciprocal
relationship. I his also implies that you
would have to notify' your target that lu
lus been selected as your choice rival. Do
not fall into this trap! Nothing will keep
him off-balance more than your sudden,
apparently unprovoked glares and gener
al cathartic negativity.
The overall result of our strategy has
changed our lives. ()ther unenlightened

students go through life
with some fair amount
of happiness, punctuat
ed by feelings of sadness
and guilt. We have,
however, eliminated
these negative feelings
through our application
of a hate-tinted lens.
But how, Doug and

Ramit?
If you want to take this to the extreme,
extend your hate to everyone-that way,
you practically have an infinite number
of rivalries of which to make use. I n other
words, we encourage lifestyles such as
that of the paranoid schizophrenic: l>\ al
ways being supremely mistrustful, you
can save a lot of time.
Say someone gives vou ar< >se. ()nly al<m >1
would trust that lifeless, thorny flower! (irab
the arm of whosoever would dare try to
plant such malevolence and slowly take pos
session of it with your latex gloves on. (Iheck
it carefully for cyanide (wondering why we
didn't use anthrax here? Because we don't
use provocative words to get mail); if you
discover that the rose is clean and fit for nor
mal use, you will feel happiness and con
tentment. And thus you see that youi initial
distrust of the situation allows you to mini
mize sadness and maximize happiness.
Some might say, "But Doug and Ramit,
isn't your proposal encouraging general
distrust of your neighbor and tearing the
seams that hold this society together?"
"Dumbass," we might reply. Apply (his
principle at your own accord, and, as al
ways, if things go as planned, we'll take the
credit. But if things don't work out, well,
vou know what to do.
