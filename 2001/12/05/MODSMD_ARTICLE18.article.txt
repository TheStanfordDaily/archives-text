## Donuts and turkeys: ASSU update 
### MATT BREWER GUEST COLUMNIST 
On what promised It) lie an aver
age clay. 1 checked my (INN
Breaking News e-mail to learn
that planes crashed into both
the Pentagon and World hade ("enter.
Later that same day, I met with ASSU
Vice President Christine Cordero, (irad
nate Student Council ( hair Filipe Santos
and members of the ASSU
(lonncil to prepare lor a meeting with
Isaac Stein, (hair <>t tlie Board of
Trustees. I housands of secure families
were dismantled into fragments of pain,
hate and bewilderment. At the same time,
we sat in the ASSU office and attempted
to carry on "business as usual."
We were preparing to discuss the rela
tionship between student representation
and Board of Trustees decision-making
committees (students serve on these com
mittees). As wedisi ussed the amelioration
and erosion of student voice, I judge my
self to have been too clrow tied in the tides
of the moment to connect the current
events with the evolution of student voice.
In the following weeks, I have observed
resurgence in student desire to become
engaged In involvement in the surround
ing ((immunity.
Now, <it the end of fall quarter, I write
to you as the student bodv president to
oiler m\ perspective 011 student voice and
its amplification .11 Stanford. I will discuss
the role, accomplishments and visions of
the Associated Students of Stanford I ui
versity in this amplification process.
Whether the Stanford Community for
Peace and |ustice rallies iu lavor of pro
peal e pcrspe( lives or the Stanford ()bjec
tivists mobili/e behind pro-retaliation ef
forts, these seemingh opposing groups

are united by a deeper bond that seeks to
effect perspective-based change.
Fhe Graduate Women's Network's ed
ucational awareness through Feminist
Theory Workshops can be likened to
SIAC's rallies against labor subcontract
ing. Both provide specific angles of reality
with intent to empower minds and hands,
which respectively articulate student voic
es and implement improved conditions.
Every group and individual is connected
by possession of change-affecting student
voice. Any student can effect change, and
every student is a member of the ASSU.
The ASSU is the official mechanism
for student voice. As students, w hen we
become entrenched in our passions and
desired areas of interest, we are obliged
to exercise our voice, our personal right
to effect change in our surrounding cir
cumstances. I his voice will not only
draft our Stanford experieiues, but our
personal development as leaders in
larger society.
The ASSU seeks to serve as an amplifi
er to student voice by empowering stu
dents with service, advocacy and resource
to express voice. We encourage all stu
dents to explore our Web site, contact
elected representatives and stav informed
about ways to get directly involved with
general areas of interest. In addition,
eai h year, we work on specific issues that
directly affect the student body.
I his year, the ASSI is focusing on
diversity, arts and transportation ini
tiatives. We are partnering with stu
dents and student groups to examine
faculty diversity, mural projects and
transportation alternatives. Further
more, on any given year, the ASSU (fi
nancially autonomous from the Uni
versity) funds hundreds of student

groups to IbsttT their abilities to ex
press voice.
l liese issues complement the ongo
ing drives for more graduate housing
options, iin l eased stipends and afford
able health insurance options. While
we will extend a proa< live arm towards
the efforts of these issues, we always
lend an ear to student concern. As rep
resentatives of the students, we cannot
work for students it we do not work
with students.
During the past few weeks, the ASSI
most visibly worked for students In
working with the Graduate Student
Council to strengthen and expand the
annual thanksgiving dinner to include
undergraduates lot the first time ever.
Also, we hosted a "(let to Know Your
ASSI!" event so tli.it students could learn
more about issues and meet elected stu
dent representatives. One hundred
Krispy Kreine donuts were disseminat
ed to hungry, concerned students.
Behind each donut and slice of
turkey, you will find passionate hearts
that devote countless hours and relent
less toil to the fruition of student voice.
Historically, the blossom of student
voice has created many niceties that we
now enjoy in our everyday university
experience. We have always responded
to our surrounding conditions hv uni
fying our < onimon voices around com
mon problems. Furthermore, we strive
fora Utopian university with the soil of
open communication and the proper
nutrients of honesty and respect. In
these conditions, student voice will
blossom into .1 flower that beautifies the
experience for Stanford students.
