ACT's cloned human embryos
grew for only ;i few hours, long
enough to form into microscopic
balls of foui to six cells each. I he
human embryos were created by
transferring the nucleus of a skin
cell into a human egg, with the
hope that the niu lens would regen

egg would develop intoablast oc) st.

Normally, only when the em

Chough tht't loiicd human em
bryos survived little more than a
few hours, the procedure ignited
ethical and scientific debates.
Scientists at Stanford and
around the world remain divided
over whether the cloned human
embrvos should be called embryos
at all and whether ACT's results
mark a suet ess or failure in the fu
ture of non-reproductive cloning.
"What (hey produced is .it most
a six-|to|-seven cell mass, which
would I would not dignifx with the
term embryo," saitl Paul Berg,
emeritus professor of cancer re

Molecular Pharmacology Prof.
Helen Blau criticized the re

periments ol tloning humans are
extremely premature when we
know so little from work that has
been done on animals."
I .aw Prof. 1 lank (lively, a mem
ber of the California Advisory
Committee on llutnan Cloning,
said, "l or nothing to grow past a
six cell stage was certainh a sur
prisingK disappointing result for
those interested in human
t loning. ()n the othei hand, it was
a first effort and I wouldn't read
too much into its failure."
