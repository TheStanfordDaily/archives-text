"We've been a lot more proac
tive as a Senate," Brewer said.
"There was a lot more tension
and less collaboration with the
Senate last vcar.'
"Because the community
has seen I he Senate working on
issues, there has been in
creased student involvement,"
he continued.
Sophomore Nitk Rodriguez,
a ineinbei ol the committee and
co-chair <>l the Student Life
( .ommillee, explained that Ihe
Senate has taken more initiative
ilns tjuarlei.
"We're stepping up our cl
ients." Rodriguez said. "We don't
|iisi want to deliver lip sei \ice to
ilic tt)inmunil\."
Rodriguez added thai this year,
main groups arc coming to tlu*
Senate and identifying the advoca
(\ committee .is a resource.
"I still feel that we should pro
vide even more outreach," said ju
nioi \imena Martinez, co-chair ol
the advocan committee. She ex
plained tli.it in terms of political is
sues and campaigns. mam < ainpus
communities are unaware that the
ASS I is available for support.

chair ol the (oinniittee. supported
Mai tinc/'s statement.
"\\ e want .in avenue to he .1
strongei voice t»» the administra
tion, Mos()ueda said. "Because
of this, we're dealing with inter
nal reform."
Rodriguez s.nd the l.u k ol stu
dent voice w.is rooted in differing
perceptions of the role of the stu
dent in the I nivcrsit\'s function
ing. Ill* tiled last week's protests
against siibcontr.uting organized
I»\ the action ionunittec as an ex
ample ol 1 his pre)l)leni.
" 1 his lac k |c>f'student \oicc| aris
es 1101 u the concept ol the- student
as a stakeholder in I iu\eisit\ life."

Rodriguez said.
"M\ feeling is that the I niversi
t\ leels that students, while the) are
important, are not stakeholders,"
he continued. "One of our major
pushes is to come to some under
standing on this issue ... It can't
c (mtinue like this — it's embarrass
ing on both sides."
Senate ('.hair Alex Shvartsman,
a senior, explained that another
goal ol tlu- Senate this year is to
claiil\ howtheASSl should han
dle- political issues. A political issue
pre >tocol and bill on individual sen
ator endorsements will take effect
next i|uarter.
" I lie 1 ationale behind these

bills is tli.it wo nood to liavoa struc
turod wa\ ol handling issues that
are external to the Senate,"
Shvartsman said. Ihe measure
had become intrcasingh neces
sary in light of the recent con tro
vers) surrounding the Senate
statement supporting affirmative
attion. he said.
Rodriguez explained that the
ASSI has the right to get involved
in external issues il they pertain to
students.
I le .ilso expressed Ins hope that
students attend Senate meetings to
provide more feedback on issues
before the Senate votes mi them
and passes resolutions.
