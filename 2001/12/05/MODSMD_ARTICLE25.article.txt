Seminar, co-sponsored I>\ I lit* Stanford
leclinolog) Ventures Program, hosted
( xaig Newinark on Nov. I I in I ernian Au
ditorium. Newinark is the founder and
( '.EC)of< raigslist, an onlinecoinmunitv that
allows people to post various listings and ex
change information, products and ideas.
\ewinark represents a new kind of en
trepi eneur, as he is both a tcchiK )logist and
philanthropist, lie s;ii<l that the idea for
craigslist came to him in HMM when he was
working at ( liarles Schwab.
"I saw people helping each othet out
loi free, and il occurred to me that, as a
programmer, I could do the same thing,"
lie said.
Visitors ol "www.craigslist.org" have ac
i ess to local job listings, housing sales, pei -
sonal ads, discussion Ibrunis and various
other services.
l he organization started as a simple
database of e-mail postings using the Pince
mail s\stem, and grew to include cities all
ovet the world.
"Craigslist is a coininnnit\ where people
can give each other a break, get the word
out when it comes to cveryda\ real-world
stulfand make their voices heard on the In
tel net." New mark told his audience.
Dining the 1 11 Seminar, Newinark
praised the organi/ation tor its strong com
munity spirit—an element he feels sets
i t aigslist apart from similar groups.
"It comes down, in a lot ol ways, to
trust," Newinark said. "We don't ask peo-

ple- to trust ns — instead we
| >i o\ ide a platform for people
to find others ihev can trust."
Newinark said the organi
zation also does on treat li and
nonprofit work through the
Craigslist Foundation, which
runs a Wishlist program to aid
those in need.
"We ma\ not be able to save
the world, but we can trv to im-

prove the <|iialit\ of people's lives," New
mark said.
Going From Research to Company
()ne ol BASES's core events, the "Entre
preneurs Challenge," allows members ol
the Stanford (ommunitv tot reatea feasible
business plan in hopes of winning seed
monc\ toactuallv start their own company.
()n Nov. 29, Dr. Micah Siegel and l>i
David Coodman spoke in an E-Challenge
workshop titled, "Coing from Research to
('.otnpanv." Siegel is President and (T.C) of
Concept 2( .otnpany, a venture-funded
startup based in Palo Alto that .issists lilt ult\
and students within universities and re
search labs in starting companies without
hav ing to quit their "day jobs."
Siegel's extensive experience in medical
research and innovation — he received
doctoral degrees in molecular biology and
electrical engineering from ( '.a I I ecli — en
ables him to give pertinent advice cont ern
ing the uncertain transition from reseat* li
to actuallv statting a conipam based on
that researt h.
Dr. David (.oodnian began the work
shop with a brief description of lus experi
etue starting Aradigm ('.orporation,a NAS-
I)AO-listed company that specializes in pul

inonarv thug deliver) , while finishing up
medical school at Harvard. Coodman s.iid
that he had a restless entrepreneurial spirit
during school, something that he sees in
main Stanford students.
" There's something in the water here in
Palo Alto that makes people get oil 'track
<ind want to start their own business,"
Coodman said.
Siegel gave the audience live helpful
questions to use as guidelines Ibi starting a
compam Among thequestions were "what
problem is being solved?"; "Who is the cus
tomer?"; "When someone will cop\ the
idea?"; and"I low can a sustainable business
be built in that part it ulai ai ena?" Siegel em
phasized that with the "change in the entre
preneurial environment, successful busi
nesses cannot be built oil high concept ideas
but on practical solutions t< > real problems."
Wireless Infrastructure
I lie BASES Interact team hosted an
"Entreprcneurship ()ppor'(unities in Wire
less Infrastructure" panel discussion on
Nov. 12. loin Perkins, editor in chief of
Red I lerritig, was the nioderatoi.
Andrea Coldsmith, an electrical engi
neering professor, s.iid that "it is not clear
who will win the wireless infrastructure

war." C iUrrenth. the strug
gle is among cellular (>per
ators, wireless local area
network operators, Blue
tooth — short-range mo
bile technology —or
other grassroots s\stems
lor small devices.
Peter Wagner, partner at
Accel Partners, said he
thought that "enterprise

o I
wireless is a real opportunit)l le said that
he believes that there is room lor start-ups
to solve deployment problems lor enter
prise wireless.
l oin Lyons, Ibrmcr chief technical offi
cer of Nokia Internet Communications,
countered that profit might bean issue in
this space, since "prices are crashing dov\ n
all the time."
When asked what the next "killer applica
tion" would lx\ (•oldsmith answered that it is
hard to sav what the end user will want. I low
ever. she said she believed e-mail would su
per* ede vow e liiirK soon in the wireless spate,
and wireless video would Ik- quite populai il
the technical limitations were overcome.
"(There is a| need to invest in te< luiolo
gv that will support multiple applications
and have great flexibility in which applica
tion to support." she said.
I lie panel disc ussion also touched on soft
ware defined radio, a let lmolog) that would
oflci the abilit) to download soli ware via
radio and satellites, which Prof. (Goldsmith
lielievesw ill now Ix* the main tet hnolog\ used
loi Internet at (ess in developing countries.
Wagner highlighted 802.11, a indus
t r\ -defined standard lor wireless I AN. as
a "good problem space." I le believes that
a good networking soft wan-com pain that

(an In* built to attack networking prob
lems such as security and installation
would !>c able to make mone\ oil ol this
technology wave.
Alheros Communications, theioinpam
highlighted during the Nov. 28 1 1 1.
speaker series, believes that 802.11 is a
good space to be in. Alheros is usualK seen
.is a lab-less semicondiu lot ( hip company
— meaning the) outsource theii «Iti| > man
ufacturing to l aiwan.
However, Rich Redells, presidi'nt and
( 1() of Atheros. (lest i ibed them more as a
systems company — one that builds not
only the ( hip, but also the systems that re
side outside the c hip .is well.
"We provide the core tcchnolog\ lor
high-speed wireless s\ steins." Redells said.
Atheros is cm reutly woi king on 802.1 la
technology—the next generation aliei
802.11b — which Redells said allows for
more channels. 11u i eased (hannels m ale up
more efficiently, allowing for the sending ol
multimedia,and are so last that \theros en

Both Redells and leresa Meng. cliiel
tc( hnical ollicer and co-founder ol Atheros
as well as a Stanford electi i( .il engineering
professor, emphasized the importance of
having faith in one's technology and the
need lo keep the momentum going l>\ con
tinually reinventing oneself.
"You have never arrived |at youi goal)."
Redells said. "You have to keep youi head
down and continue to execute."
Meng added, "Vou must have laiih that
you're right and faith in vour technology."
Atheros raised $07 million in venture capi
tal last April, an impressive leal given the re
cent economic downturn.
