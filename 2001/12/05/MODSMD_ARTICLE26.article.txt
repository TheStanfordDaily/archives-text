# If your appendix hurts, do not 'distress'
## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Have you ever felt a persistent pain in your
lower right abdomen? I mil .1 few years ago, doc
tors tin night thev could tell whether or not this was

eauscd by .111 inflamed
appendix. Recently. the
(onsensus has been that,
despite .ill kinds of high
tech diagnostic tools,
such as (' I mans and la
paroscopics, ascertain
ing appendix inflamma
tion is not guaranteed,
for one thing, doctors
cannot rely on other
symptoms sinec the ap
pendix has no function
and its inflammation

therefore does not ailed digestion. Secondly, the
tiny appendix is tucked awa\ in the back of the
belly <ind is hard to visuali/c. As a result, as many
as 10.000 unnecessary appendectomies are per
formed each year, mostly in women.

Tired of debugging that program or spend
ing all-nighters on problem sets? If you are
overcoming all these situations, the stress might
actually he good for you. I here are two types of
stress: distress (good) and distress (bad). Ihe
first category incot porates sue ccssful (ompletion
ol deadlines, speaking and other stressful chal
lenges, which triggers the production of im
munoglobulins— proteins that strengthen the
immune system. The second category includes
things bevond one's control siu 11 as anxiety
caused In continuous reprisals of \\ I ('.attacks,
which diminishes immunoglobulin production
.ind weakens the immune s\stem.

My Thanksgiving Dinner next year will be rasp-

berry cobbler, raspberry juice and turkey with
raspberry filling. Wh\ r A recent stud) with

lab rats suggests that consuming two (ii| >>
of black rasplxTries daily may held ward
oil esophageal cancer. Berries contain an-

t i( arcinogenic
compounds like

anthocvanius, vita-

mins and minerals.
Strawberries also provide
the same Ix'nefits, but to a
lesser degree. The bene
fits of eating raspberries
join the growing list of
food discoveries, which
includes the famous "red
wine is good for the
heart." As with every
thing in this list, do not go

oyerboard — a balanced, varied diet is still the liest
protection against disease.
So you don't have a car and are tired of biking
daily up and down hills. Fear not, because soon

you

will be

able to purchase
better electric bikes. A new model is currently
being developed In Italian bikemakei Aprillia.
I he prototvpe stores compressed hydrogen in a
two-litci can ist ei. which is ignited to produce elec
tric i urrent. I be bike at liieves a top speed of 20
nipli, weighs 20 percent less than regular electric
models and travels miles before it needs more
gas. Also, burning hydrogen only produces water
vapor, which makes the vehicle pollution-free.
Sounds too good to be true? 1 lie catch: the price
is $2,300.
The laws of the universe might not be the same
everywhere at all times. In the early 1000s, astro
physicists established a fundamental constant,
alpha, which permeated universal laws. Now, sci
entists think that alpha ma\ have changed over
time. F.vidence comes from studies of light by an
international group led by John k. Webb of the
University of New South Wales in Australia. For
the past lour years, repeated sets of 'data are lead
ing to the same conclusion: about I I billion years
ago, alpha was weaker by one part in 100,000. The
difference is tiny, but implies revisions in the cur
rent theory. While many remain skeptical, other
scientists are excited that tiny irregularities in the
c osmic background could have ac tually caused dif
ferent phenomena at other times.
