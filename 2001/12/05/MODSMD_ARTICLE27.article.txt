Q: Answer Girl, I must have missed the
answer to this question in second grade. Why
is the sky blue?
A: Well, the sky doesn't seem to be so blue
lately, but 1 know what you mean.
Light enters the atmosphere as a wave of vi
brating electric and magnetic fields. The part
of the electromagnetic spectrum we can actu
ally see is visible light- It may look like white
light, but it is made up of all the colors of the
rainbow. Kach color in white light has a difler

ent wavelength. Red light has the longest
wavelength, and violet light has the smallest
wavelength.
In space, light travels in a straight line, be
cause nothing is disturbing it. After it enters the
atmosphere, it will usually bump into dust par
ticles or gas molecules, but what happens to the

light depends on its wavelength and the si/e of
the things it hits. Dust particles and water
droplets are much larger than the wavelength
of visible light. These objects reflect the differ
ent colors in a way that we still see white light,
because it still contains all of the same colors.
However, gas molecules are usually
smaller than the wavelength of visible light.
When light hits these molecules, some of it
may be absorbed. Higher frequencies like
blues are absorbed more often than lower
frequencies like reds. After the blue light is
absorbed, it is radiated in different direc
tions and is scattered all around the sky. Ac
tually, a lot of violet light is scattered as well,
but our eyes can more easily detect the blue
light, so the sky looks blue.
