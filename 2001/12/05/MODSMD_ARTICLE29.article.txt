Although ihi' Held station will be the lirst
green building 011 campus, David Neuman,
I 'nivei sii\ archiict t, emphasized other ways
that Stanford considers the environment
when building.
"We're moving more and more to the
pedestrian- and bicycle-oriented campus,"
Neuman said, explaining that Stanford is
building in vacant areas 011 campus rather
than sprawling at ross more land.
Dan lirger, .1 (>1 eenpeat eat livist woi king
with students on green architecture, said
Stanford could be an example to businesses
other universities, but needs to do more to
make its buildings environmentally sound.
"Stanford, In making at ommitment to be
green, would rcalh send ripples through so
ciety," he said. "There's just a lot that's not
being at letl on."
