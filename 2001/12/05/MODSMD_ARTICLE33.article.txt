plavei s on Stanford's side ol the court
had .ii least seven kills — the same
number posted by Nevada's leading
attackers, middle blocker Michelle
More and outside hitter Su/anne
Stonebarger.
"We've been adding more and more
weapons and coming up with more
and more ways to store points," said
Stanford head coach |ohn Dunning.
"We're still getting better. We've come
a long way this season."
Junior outside hitter Logan loin
led the way for the Cardinal both of
fensively and defensively, posting her
23 rd double-double of the season with
a match-high 13 kills and 10 digs.
Senior setter Robvn Lewis kept the
( ardinal attack well spread throughout
the match, getting If) kills out of her
middle blockers, sophomore Sara
\h (»ee and senior l ara (ionrad, and an
additional eight kills from junior out
side hitter Ashley Ivy on the right side.
Strong serving by all of the Cardi
nal's jump-servers — who tallied seven
of the Cardinal's eight aces — stalled
Nevada's offense, which could only
muster a . 127 hitting percentage in the
match. Meanwhile, the Wolf Pack run
up nine service errors without picking
up any aces.
"Our goal was to be competitive,
and we were able to do that in the first
game and the third game," said Neva
da head coach Devin Scruggs. "We
wanted to serve tough and pass well.
Stanford was able to control us when
we weren't doing both well."
Another big serving game by Stan
lord on Saturday helped shut down the
Spartans' offense, as the Cardinal put
forth one its strongest defensive dis
plavs of the season.
Stanford outblocked San Jose State
12-f) and outdug the Spartans 52-42,
forcing them to hit at a measly .154 clip.
"This could've been a pressure
packed match at this point in the sea
son," Dunning said. "But we've been
playing better defense as the year goes
along. We outdug them tonight, which
