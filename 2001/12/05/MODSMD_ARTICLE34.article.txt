MATT SAYIES/The Stanford Daily
Senior fullback Casey Moore didn't let a muddy field or the San Jose State defense keep him
from scoring on a 13-yard run in the fourth quarter, icing Stanford's 41-14 victory .
touchdown two plays into tlu- sec
ond quarter and also had a f>N-vard
punt return, proving he deserved
last week's recognition as the first
team All-American punt retnrnei.
1 he win broke the Cardinal's
string of three-straight losses to the
Spartans (!M)) and marked onh the
second Stanford nine-win season in
50 years and the first since 1992,
when Bill Walsh's squad went 9-;f.
" I he last three years have been
frustrating for this team." Stanford
senior guard Eric lleitmann said.
"It's ,t I),ii kyard brawl and I'm glad
we came through with a victor) ibis
year."
I he game even looked like a
schoolyard light Saturday. 1 he
Spartan Stadium field had been
subjected to a week's worth of rain,

and after a high school champi
onship game the night before, the
swampy turf was covered in about
as much mud as it was grass.
But though the slippery turf mav
have hampered each team's skill
players, Stanford's hogs seemed
more than content to wallow in the
mire, and it showed in the Cardi
nal's 220 rushing yards.
"As an oflcnsive lineman you al
most love plaving in conditions like
that," Ileitmann said. "You some
times think that's how football
should be played."'
Phis was only the third meeting
in the teams' .">(>-vear series play e< 1 .it
S|SI , and Saturday demonstrated
some of the reasons s< hool officials
are reluctant to hold the game in
San Jose. l he 17,745 in attendance
were the fewest to watch a Stanford
game since 19S0, immediately fol
loyving the 1 ,oma Preita earthquake.
I he tiny crowd produced some
excitement during the Stanford

Band's halftime show. A fan, report
edly an SJSI.. - female student,
jumped the railing behind the ( .ir
dinal sideline and ran at Stanford's
mascot. Yell leaders and hand
members tackled the assailant be
fore she reac bed her target and led
her to waiting law enforcement.
I'lie Spartans had just as much
luck finding the end zone against
Stanford's defense-.

rushing attack. allowing just 30 net
yards. Spartan tailback Deonce
Whitaker, yvhorac ked up 25 1 yards
on the Cardinal last season, was
held to three yards on two cat lies.
Whitaker had boasted eai liei in the
week that he expected another 200-
yard game.
"We didn't allow them to be
two-dimensional [on offense|,"
Stanford coach I vrone Willing
ham said. " They weren't able to
have both options xvorking like
they have in the past."'
