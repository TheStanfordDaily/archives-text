## There's no place like home 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
I o get back home, Dorothy just needed lot lie k the
heels (>1 her red ruby shoes.
It wasn't that easy lor the Stanford men's Miner
team. But after clawing its wa\ to the I'.k ifit 10 (ion
feretue title and amassing .111 impressive 16-1-1
record, the (iardinal earned the right to come back to
New Maloney I ield for the \( iAA I'oui nainent.
It wasn't I >\ accident. 1 hroughout the regular sea
son, Stanford's main goals were to win the I'ac -10 and
to earn home field advantage for the plavofls.
"I think to everyone winning the l'ac-10 has .1
special connotation," said Stanford head < oac li Bret
Simon. "As a prac tic al matter, in winning the \( A A
chainpionship, which is our final goal, ha\ rug home
field advantage is a bigger piece ol achieving that
goal than the conference title. If vou look .11 it ovei
the years, the home team has had .1 better penent
age of wins."

Hut, ohviouslv, Spiteri couldn't drain n all. I lie

"It's alw a\ s an advantage to pla\ at home," said ju

Iii addition to the ( rowd, there
is something about the field iisell
that make s ii a lavoiable place loi

the (Cardinal to play.
"I think in all sports there is a lit -
tie bit ola mystery as to why teams
perform differently at home,"
Simon said. "But this lield in par
ticular has a very personal close
ness with the fans. It helps inspire
the team and makes them even
more committed to giving their
best effort. Ihe crowd is the

biggest thing about ibis lield. It's
bigger than the lield itscll or the
lights. I he most important thing is
the relationship the team lias with
the lims at the- game. Out lield is
really a home.''
Who knows how l)orolh\ leli
when she woke up in Kansas? But.
it appears that in Stanford's case,
there truly is no place like home.
