Before she even stepped foot on I he

1 he summer before her sophomore

competing in the 2000 Summer
Oh mpics, and most recentl\ Fom spent
her summer helping the I S. qualify for
the 2002 Women's \Ollevhall World

Before competing with and against
the top volleyball players in the world,
Fom plaved baseball and basketball
with the hoys in elementary school,
loin acknowledges she was a tomboy
growing up and competed on the boy's
basketball team in the fourth grade
after a name mix-lip landed " Fom
Logan" on the squad.
"I stayed because it was fun; plus I was
the tallest player on the team." said Fom.
The six-foot-one Salt I ake ('.it y native
began her athletic domination on that
team and has continued it throughout
her high school, college and national
team careers.
Her Cardinal teammates called her
"l'opeye" freshman vear, but it wasn't a

reference to her incredible strength or
an afFmit\ for spinach, but rather be
(ause o! her crude sailor-like language
during practice. Hut loin, a quit k-lcarn
ei and hard-worker, was m< redibly suc
(essful her freshman vear.
Fom headed to Sydney after a phe
nomenal rookie campaign, during
w hit li slit- led the ( ardinal in a< es, digs
and kills, was named Vollevhall Maga
zines Freslunan of the Year and be
came only the fourth freshman in
NCAA history to be named a first-team
\II-Amcrican In the American Volley
ball (!oac lies Association.
In Sydney, Fom earned universal
praise from »oac lies, teammates and op
ponents for her poise, talent and
strength on the court. During the
Olvnipic (>ames she notched 96 kills as
the team headed to an improbable
fourth-place finish.
" Flic Ohmpics were one of the most
wonderful experiences that I've ever
had. I om said. "I he city of Sydney itself
was so beautiful and the whole process of
training with the national team and
building up to Olympic competition
taught me so much."
Never one to remain idle, Fom
brought that knowledge back to her
Stanford teammates, whom she rejoined
foi her sophomore season a mere eight
days after returning from Sydney.
"She brought a lot of experiene back
to the team." said senior defensive spc

< i.ilisi Emih Lawrence. "She taught us
things like how to dig harrier hit halls."
1 lie team had a disappointing 2000
season, hut loin again led the team in
aces, digs and kills and earned her sec
ond All-America honors despite missing
the fii si half of the mati lies.
lom returned to the international
m cue this summer to lead the I .S. Na
tional team in service aces and plate
second in kills. # I lie team traveled all
over the world, including Russia,
Brazil, Switzerland and the Nether
lands and played under tough condi
tions that loin says included hrick and
outdoor courts.
1 his year, Tom returned to the
It iendl) confines of Maples Pavilion to
continue her collegiate success. She was
recently named Pac-10 Player of the
Year and earned Pac-10 Player of the
Week .in unprecedented three times
during the season, all while leading the

So, what's next for the talented I oin?
Now, Logan and company are pursu

10 Coach of the Year John Dunning.
I lie squad hosts the Regional tourna
ment this weekend and two more wins
will earn them a Final Four berth.

appearance in 2004 to follow-up a mem
