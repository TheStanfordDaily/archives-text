# 2002: Time for tennis goddess Kournikova to bare all?
## 
### 
Since this happens to lie my last
column of tlit* year 2001, I
have decided to relied on the
new year that is upon us and com
pile a list of my hopeful predictions
tor the world of sports in 2002:
10. 1 lie I .S. soccer team finally
realizes its potential and advances
out of the first round of competi
tion at the summer's World (Hip.
1 hen, beating the odds, the team
even wins its second round mate h,
showing the world that us dumb
Americans can play the world's
most popular sport, too.
0. Ray Lewis' next murder at
tempt gets foiled, and the raxing
lunatic finally gets sent to jail,
where he belongs. I'here, he will
have the utmost time to perfect a
new stadium-entrance dance,

which he will show off in 10 years
at Superbowl XLV as a 37-year
old linebacker that has repaid his
debt to society.
(S. Anna Kournikova wins the
first singles tournament of her ca
reer, and to celebrate, she decides
to pose nude tor Playboy. Knough
said.
7. l he sport of lumberjacking
catches on like wildfire, getting
(lie national attention that it most
definitely deserves. FSPN2's rat
ings of the sport go through the
roof, and Harry Burnsworth —
the defending gold medallist in
the Great Outdoor Games' Hot
Saw competition — becomes a na
tion.il celebrity, appearing in mul
tiple beer commercials as well as
his own "(lot Milk" ad.

(). Another ath
lete gets caught iu
a hotel room with
crack and a bunch
of hookers (a la
Ken (.aminiti) or
gets caught with
over 200 pounds
of pot in his <ai (a
la Nate Newton).

These kinds of athlete screw-ups
are just too tminv. I don't think 1
could go a year without them.
5. lhe U.S. Ryder Cup team
prevails over Furope in Septem
bei as Figer sinks a 30-fbot put to
seal the deal. ()nce again, the rest
of the I .S team rushes the green
and mobs the goiter who lias
c linched the- Cup, upsetting all of
the uptight Furopeans and show

ing just how bad-ass a country we
really are.
1. Barry Sanders hops on the
bandwagon and unretires, join
ing any team in the NFL other
than the l ions. In the 2002 sea
son, Sanders shows once again
why he is by far the best run
ning back of his generation,
gaining enough yards to pass
Waltei Payton on the all-time
list and to ensure that Lmmitt
Smith will never hold the num
ber-one position.
3. In a late-season game be
tween the Takers and the Knicks,
l.atrell Sprewell spazzes and
charges Takers' coach Phil j.uk
son, c hoking him and rendering
him unable to coach the rest of the
season. I hen, without Jackson at

the helm, the Lakers bicker
amongst themselves so much that
eventually the team has an all-out
brawl iu the locker room during
which Shaq beats the ever-loving
crap out of Kobe, knoc king him
out of the lest of the season as well.
And so, the Kobe-less Takers are
unable to win their third-straight
title, which instead goes to the
Kings or the Mavs — undoubted
ly the two most exciting teams in
the league.
2. Stanford's men's basketball
team wins its second national title
ever and its first since 1042, beat
ing Duke by one point in the fi
nals, as senior leader and point
guard 1 ony (iiovacchini drains a
championship-winning jump
shot over the ontstretc lied arms of

Duke s ul)er-star |ason Williams
as tinu' expires.
I. |ason (iiamhi resists Ilu- evil
power that is the New York Yan
kees and sia\s in Oakland. Jessie
Ventura prevails and the 1 wins
don't get«out rat ted, and both the
As and the I wins make the play
oils l liey late oil in the ALCS,
w J lit h the As win in a thrilling
seven-game series, only to get
swept l>\ the new-look Metsinthe
World Series.
To be completely honest, ij I were a bel
ling man, I wouldn't put too much
money <lown on these 10 predictions,
but you inn always dream. // things re
ally start /ailing my way, Anna
kournikovui oidd be a Playboy liunny
come Inly.
