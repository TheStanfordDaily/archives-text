I t »ll( >wing much hv|>eand media s|>ec uLition — and a
s|xvial sneak preview lor a fiimous Stanford hut' —
renowned invfiiloi Dt'an K.unt'iion Monda\ unveiled a
two-wheeled sc<x>tci ilia! lit' said would revolutionize
urban life.

hidant cs to prevent the usei lioin falling off .
I niversity President John Hennessy test-drove the
Scgwa\ last month, courtesy of Kamen, and has affirmed
the vehi( Ic's massive poiential.
Vehicle features innovative design
In .1 press release, Kamen said, "the Seaway 11 l'can
i nakeud)an environments more livable by providing a so
lution to short-distance travel. IftheScgwav 111 is widely
adopted, it could help solve major urban problems, such
as pollution, congestion and livability."
Some of Kamen s other inventions include the first
(Mu table dialysis mat bine and a smart whcel< hair co-tle
velojK'd with |ohnson X: |ohnson tailed the IB() I.
I lie Segway is a (>5- to 85-pound vehicle with two
wheels side-by-side, making it resemble a lawn mower. It is
.ill clct trie, with batteries th;it need to Ik- recharged with
every 17 miles of ground covered.
It (.111 handle .1 payload of up to 250 pounds and its
speed ranges from five to 17 miles per hour.
I he most impressive part of the vehicle is that it has in
tegrated sensors and gyroscopes that keep the user well
balanced while standing on the vehicle so that it is ex
tremely stable and extremely difficult to fall from.
Sensoi•son the vehi< lcaut<miaticafly detect any human
movement and adjust the fxisition of the veliit le so that it
works with the user. I lie vehicle has Ixx'n likened some
what to a hovercraft.
Although the veliit le has an initial price tag of $B,(MH),
Kamen has announced that there will l>c a version of the
veliit le available to the public at a cost of$3,(KK).
Device draws mixed reactions
I wo weeks ago, Kamen gave a sneak preview of the
Segway to executives and government officials up and
down Silicon Valley, int luding I lennessy.
"We did indeed try it out," I lennessy said. "It's one
of the most unusual transportation vehicles I have seen.
It could change transportation in crowded areas, if it i->
successful.'
Andy Grove, chairman of Intel, also tried out a Scg-

way velik lc. 1 le told I imc Magazine, " I lie mat bine is
gorgeous. I'm no good al balancing; ii would lake me
100 years to learn lo snowboard I bis took me less tban
live minutes."
Dave Powell, professor emeritus ol aer< >nauti< s,»nd as
tronautics and met banual engineering, lound tbevehic le
interesting, but expressed doubts alxuil I.be 1 1\| h* sur
rounding its release.
"It'san interesting new iwist on a mot< >rizeds< ooterlx>
eause the two w heels are side-bv-side," Powell said. "That
makes it moreeompa< I foi travel on congested pathways."
"I don't Ix'lieve it is w<»nb all the In pealx>ut it Ix-ing as
big an invention as the automobile 11 bat | will Ixrome (as|
widely used," be added.
Powell said be was also concerned about the ma

" Ilie downside of such a design is that the stabilization

\ieme\er said that while there's the temptation to
think of the Segwa\ as mcrclv .i souped-up se<x)ter, "the
