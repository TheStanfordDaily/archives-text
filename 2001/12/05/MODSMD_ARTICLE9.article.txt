()n Dec. 5, 1990, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about 11-C's decision to make rush dry:
"The I nterfraternity Council voted over
whelmingly Monday U> require all campus fra
ternities to hold an alcohol-lree Rush spring
quaiter, a move that 1M • president hrik Jor
gensen descrilx'd as a 'major |x>licy change.
"Stanford's (ireek system was one of the
only systems nation-wide that still allowed al
cohol to be served at Rush functions, accord
ing to (orgensen, a senior.
" Jorgensen said the switch to a dry Rush
is intended to 'send a strong message' to the
University that the IFC is committed to'self
regulation.'
" 'It's a good step for us,' Jorgensen said.
'We're showing the University that we're
taking matters into our own hands, rather
than waiting until they step in. YVe wanted to
assure them early on.'
"Stanford's new alcohol policy played a
large role in the 1 FC.'s decision, he added.
" T his is in line with Stanford's new alco
hol policy,' |orgensen said. ' The wet Rush
hasn't heen abused in the past, but we decid
ed to end it. particularly because of the new
alcohol policy.'"
Bottom Line: Rush events haven't been the same
since.
