Offered by Prof. Donald Barr
This course will take a broad look at differences in health status and health
care access for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., and for those from lower
socioeconomic classes. It will examine how lower social class and minority sta
tus often overlap in affecting health, and how factors such as unconscious
racial bias on the part of providers and mistTust of the system on the part of
patients can impede equal access to medical care.
