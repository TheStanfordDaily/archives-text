## Facility features new seats, new screens and digital stereo sound 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The two-screen theater known
to students as the l'alo Alto Square
has reopened under the new own
ership of Cine Arts, an art-house
subsidiary of the national Century
Theatres chain.
"We've upgraded the movie
experience while maintaining
the booking policy of showing art
and independent films only,"
said Cine Arts spokesperson
Nancy Klasky.
Klasky said the theater has been
remodeled with "all-new rocking
love seats, new screens, new digital
stereo sound systems and a new
snack bar."
Located at El Camino Real and
Page Mill Road, the theater had
been closed since last August,
when its long-time occupant Land
mark Theatre lost the building's
lease. (HneArts then made a deal to

move into the space and an
nounced that it would reopen by
the end of September.
The theater did not reopen,
however, until Christmas Day.
"We had construction delays,"
Klasky explained.
The Miramax French film
"Amelie" was originally scheduled
to clebut at the Palo Alto Square,
but was cancelled when the theater
failed to open iti time.
In addition to selling tradition
al movie snacks, like popcorn and
soda, the theater also otters special
gourmet desserts.
The Cine Arts theater in Palo
Alto is the third in the nation, after
one in Evanston, 111. and another in
Mill Valley. A fourth Cine Arts the
ater will open this year in San Jose,
Klasky said.
Klasky added that the ('.ineArts
in Evanston is similar to the one in
Palo Alto, as both are located in
college towns where the demand
for art lilms can be higher than
other c ities.
"There is a propensity for inter
est in art and independent films
among college students, and so
many college students are inter-

ested in film as a study as well," she
said. "I think it's wonderful that,
there's a theater so close to the
University."
Cine Arts is the one of four art
house theaters near the Stanford
campus. The other three are
owned by Landmark Theatres: the
Aquarius in Palo Alto and the Guild
and Park in Menlo Park.
While a few students said they
wished that a theater showing
mainstream blockbuster-type
movies would open closer to cam
pus, most siiicl they were pleased
that art films will continue to be
shown at the Palo Alto Square.
"I'm glad [the theater] is going
the independent route," said ju
nior Casey Brazeal. "I think college
students see independent films not
for the sake of the genre, but be
cause we're more aware of the films
out there."
Sophomore Elizabeth Yin of
fered a similar perspective. "1 like
philosophical and art films," she
said. "Even though there are now
four theaters that show these kinds
of films, the) - don't house as many
screens as the AMC [Mercado 20
theaters in Santa Clara]."
