Just days before a pair of suicide
bombings by Islamic militants killed
25 in Israel, a small group gathered
on Nov. 29 at Stanford to observe an
International Day of Solidarity with
the Palestinian People, presented by
the Coalition for Justice in

Israel / Palestine.
About 30 people met in Bltlg. 320 to
hear four speakers present their experi
ences and opinions and had the chance to
ask questions of the panelists.
According to a publicity e-mail for the
event, the day is observed by the United
Nations every year on Nov. 29. On that
day in 1947, the UN General Assembly
adopted the Partition Plan, which pro
vided for the establishment of a " Jewish
state"and an "Arab state-" in Palestine.
I he coalition offered fliers ex
plaining its mission to "educate the
American public about the plight of
Palestinians living under the U.S.-
sponsored Israeli occupation and
apartheid and contribute to the cam
paign against these violent, inhu
mane acts."

According to Modern Thought and
Literature doctoral student Yael Ben-zvi,
one of the panel s organizers and a mem
ber of the coalition, "[The organization's]
main goal is educating the public about
what it often doesn't get a chance to hear
in the media. We believe that if more facts
about the Israeli / Palestinian conflict and
the nature of U.S. involvement in it were
known, our communities would have
been able to help resolve this painful ton-
Hid for the benefit of all sides. "
Modern Thought and Literature doc
toral student Kvelvn Alsultany spoke
about the conflict in light of the events of
Sept. 1 I and urged citizens to "resist the
attempts bv the media, politicians and in
dividuals to reconstruct a distinct separa
tion between an 'us' and 'them.'
"Our relationship with peoples of

other nations has changed, particularly
those who have experienced terror and
tragedy," she continued. "[People need
to] take this moment of identification to
stand in solidarity and demand peaceful
solutions to the problems that cause vio
lence and terror."
Alsultany argued, as did several oth
ers, that the U.S. must stop aid to Israel
and support the Palestinian people's
right to self-determination and national
independence.
Dudy Tzfati, an Israeli post-doctoral
fellow at UC-San Francisco and co
founder of the Alliance fora Just Peace
in the Middle East, added, "In solidari
ty lies the possibility to bring two collec
tive identities together to overlap some
how, so that they are no longer mutual
lv exclusive."

Responding to the recent wave of
Palestinian suicide bombings in Israeli
territory, Tzfati said, "Solidarity with the
Palestinian people does not mean sup
porting the killing of Israelis, just like
solidarity with the Israeli people does
not mean supporting the occupation
and the killing of Palestinians."
"If we care about both [groups] and
want to save the lives of Palestinians and
Israelis alike, [we must] oppose the occu
pation and assassination policies that led
to this bloodshed," he continued.
Senior Kanda Scrag, who attended the
presentation, said she wanted to express
her "solidarity with the long-oppressed
Palestinian people."
"It was enlightening and encouraged
me to think about the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict in new ways," she said.
