## The
						Stanford Daily Stanford football will greatly miss Willingham 
### 
Published Since 1891

The news displayed prominently at
the top of the ESPN.com Web page
stunned Stanford football fans ev
erywhere: "Willingham to coach
Notre Dame." It didn't seem true. Only two
weeks after shunning "The Sheriff" for the
mendacious George O'Leary, the Fighting
Irish had hired Willingham as football coach.
Certainly this was a tremendous blow to Stan
ford football.
Willingham, during his seven years at Stan
ford, was nothing short of impressive. His
final record of 44-36-1 seems somewhat
mediocre, but it obscures what he has done for
the program. He led Stanford to four bowl
games in seven years, including the 2000 Rose
Bowl as Pacific 10 Conference champions.
Stanford burst onto the national scene with

this year's 9-3 record and top-25 finish. .And
he never lost a Big Game.
Willingham gave Stanford a team that it
could be proud of not only on the field, but
more importantly, off the field. His players
are models for other NCAA football teams.
They study hard and do not get into trouble
off the field. Willingham worked hard to in
still discipline and character into his players,
and it shows.
We do not begrudge Willingham his deci
sion to leave Stanford, though. It certainly
hurts Stanford, but it is a tremendous boost to
his career. Notre Dame is the premier coach
ing job in college football, and he will have the
opportunity to show his talents on a national
scale. He deserves the opportunity to follow
up on his success at Stanford.

We would like to advise Athletic Director
led Leland on choosing a new coach. First, it
is important to choose quickly. January is the
heart of the recruiting season, and a new head
coach will bring stability to the program. It will
make Stanford look that much better to top
recruits, who are crucial to sustaining the mo
mentum of this season.
Second, it is important to keep a sense of
continuity. The team's current talent has it
poised for several winning seasons in the
next few years. We must not squander this
tremendous talent on rebuilding years. This
is not to say that a current assistant coach
should necessarily be promoted, but rather
that the new coach should work within the
current offensive and defensive playbook as
much as possible.

Finally, and most importantly, the new
coach must follow all the NCAA's rules and
set high academic standards for his players.
Stanford cannot have its image tarnished by
recruiting violations or other illegal actions.
Stanford also lias a well-deserved reputation
for football players who work hard and
graduate. This too must not change, no mat
ter what.
With these qualifications in mind, we look
forward to the selection of Stanford's next
football coach. We are confident that Leland
will swiftly choose an experienced, ethical
leader for the team. We also thank Willing
ham for the success he has brought to Stan
ford and wish him well in his new job, except
for Oct. 5, 2002, in South Bend, when we
hope he loses to Stanford 37-3.
