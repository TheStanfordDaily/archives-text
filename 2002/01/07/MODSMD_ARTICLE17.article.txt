Appendix does perform a useful function
In the Innovation section of'The Daily
from Wed., Dec. 5, 4niit Garg wrote that
"the appendix has no function." On the
contrary, the appendix has multiple func
tions including being "involved in the
control of which essential bacteria come to
reside in the caecum and colon in neona
tal life".
A full discussion of its usefulness can

and www.answersingenesis.org/docs/

In fact, besides a simple correction, it
would make an interesting article to dis
cuss how myths such as the "useless ap
pendix" propagate through a scientific
community that supposedly eschews un
founded dogma.
Unfortunately, scientists quite often
establish their own irrational dogmas ei

ther because they intensely want to be
lieve a certain unproven idea, or to save
their reputations. I don't fault Garg for
his error, as he could not have known
that his science teachers were uncritical
in this regard.
Let us all continue to seek knowledge of
the truth, and we will be encouraged as we
learn it more and more.
