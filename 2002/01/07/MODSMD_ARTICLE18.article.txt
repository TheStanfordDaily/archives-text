sume he was a very troubled young man."

Cessna 172R from a St. Petersburg airport and

to land from a Coast Guard helicopter, he
crashed into the 28th floor of the 42-story Bank

specifically targeted the building or "had any
intention of harming anyone else."
The note, a few paragraphs handwritten on
plain white paper, w.is not addressed to anyone

specifically, said police spokeswoman Katie
Hughes. In the note he did not mention his
family, nor did he say goodbye to anyone, she
said, although authorities interpret it as a sui
cide note.
Investigators yesterday interviewed the
boy's family and said they would search his per
sonal computer for evidence.
Bishop, of Palm Harbor, was told to check
the plane's equipment before the start of a fly
ing lesson Saturday, police said. He took off
without waiting for an instructor who was sup
posed to accompany him.
A Coast Guard helicopter crew motioned for
the boy to land but couldn't gel a response, and
