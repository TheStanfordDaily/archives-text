# $60 billion amount spent on anti-terrorism will increase
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Con-
gress has provided more than $60
billion since September to combat
terrorism at home and abroad and
to rebuild from the attacks on New
York and Washington. That's
roughly five times what the nation
spent to fight terrorism in the pre
vious year.
Some costs are one-time ex
penses or will diminish in coming
years — like helping communities
recover from the Sept. 1 1 devasta
tion, but other anti-terrorism pro
grams are sure to grow.
When he sends Congress his
$2 trillion budget tor fiscal 2003
next month, President Bush is ex
pected to propose billions more
for the military's $345 billion
wartime budget for the rest of this
year, plus a hefty increase for
next year for government-wide
anti-terrorism efforts. Fiscal 2003
begins Oct. 1.
Republic an aides on the I louse
Budget Committee estimate that

so-called homeland security pro
grams alone — such as hiring
FBI agents and stopping bioter
rorists — will grow by $150 bil
lion over the next decade. That
excludes money for military anti
terrorism operations and for local
recovery aid.
Not all of the $60 billion Con
gress approved will be spent this
vear. Precise figures remain hazy
because of disagreements —
sometimes fueled by politics —
over what exactly constitutes anti
terrorism spending and because
such activities are often included
within broader programs and are
not distinct.
"We're scrambling to figure out
precisely how much was enacted,"
said spokeswoman Melissa \ler
son, of the nonpartisan Congres
sional Budget Office.
Though but a sliver of the fed
eral budget, $60 billion exceeds
the 2000 revenues of all but the
dozen largest U.S. corporations.
