## Late Heel comeback knocks off Cardinal

COLUMBUS, OHIO â€” How
much difference can one minute
make in a 22-game season?
Enough to keep it from being a
23-game national championship
season, as the Stanford men's soc
cer team learned after falling to
eventual champion North Caroli
na in the NCAA College Cup
semifinals, held on Dec. 14.

but a pair of North Carolina goals
in the 81st and 82nd minutes
were all it took to tie the game and
reverse over an hour of Cardinal
dominance.

have been the most successful
season in the Cardinal men's soc

record of 19-2-1. The 3-2 defeat
represented the most goals the
Cardinal conceded all year.
"Once it became 2-2, it became
anyone's moment to win the
game, and they did it," said Stan
ford head coach Bret Simon.

Through the first three 15-
minute overtime periods, Stan
ford appeared the more likely of
the two teams to seize the mo

opponents 13-5, and several near
misses had the Tar I feels shaking
in their cleats.

After seeing a two goal lead over North Carolina slip away in the closing
minutes of its semifinal game, the Cardinal eventually lost the game in the
third overtime to the Tar Heels, who would go on to win the championship.

when All-Pac-10 defender T odd

and rifled a shot over
Ueltschey's head.
Despite its lead, Stanford kept
attacking into the second half,
and the shifty Moses cataly/ed a

a hesitation move to beat two Tar

Yet just minutes later, Tar Heel
forward David l esto launched a

The Tar Heels proceeded to

"After going two-nil up, in my
opinion I thought it was ours to

didn't keep the lead at two-nil is
disappointing, and you have to
give North Carolina credit for

have won the game."
Stanford outshot the Tar Heels

30-21 for the game, with its de

North Carolina's runs to the cor

away from the advancing for

shots count, using their size and
power in the box to come up with
crucial loose balls such as t he* ones
that fell to Crawford and Cell for
their second and third goals.
North Carolina, which entered
the College Cup as an underdog
with the seventh seed, had much
less trouble dispatching Indiana 2-

the season with a 21-4 record.
