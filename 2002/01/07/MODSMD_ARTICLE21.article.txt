# Closing minutes prove fatal for men

### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
COLUMBUS, OHIO — The Stan
ford men's soccer team allowed just 10
goals in its first 21 games. So when ju
nior forward Roger Levesque put the
Cardinal ahead by two goals with less
than 10 minutes to play against North
Carolina in the national semifinals, few
entertained the possibility of a Tar 1 leel
comeback.
After (he game, North Carolina head
coach Elmar Bolowich would call the
outcome "unthinkable."
Three goals and four overtimes later,
the Cardinal players were left with their
heads bent in defeat, "wondering what
might have been possible had the ball

bounced their way.
What if the ball had bounced into the
net rather than out when Johanes Mali/a
tagged the post with a shot from three
yards out in the second overtime? What
if the ball had bounced just a foot lower
when it came off the head of Roger
Levesque in the third overtime? What if
the ball had bounced to Ail-American de
fender Lee Morrison instead of North
Carolina forward Mike Gell just seconds
before Gell drove home the winning shot
in the fourth overtime?
What if?
A likely answer came two days later
when North Carolina smothered Indi
ana to win its first national champi
onship.
"It's a crazy game," Tar Heel senior

Chris Xeitch told the Columbus Dis
patch. "Anything can happen."
What happened was that North Car
olina forward David Testo fired the ball
over the Stanford defense and past goalie
Andrew Terris in the 81st minute to give
his team what Stanford head coach Bret
Simon called "a shot in the arm."
"I have not seen a better goal all year
than the one David Testo scored to put
us on the board and give us new life,"
Bolowich said.
A minute later, David Stokes bonked a
shot oil the Cardinal crossbar, and Stan
lord's attempted clear took the first of
several critical Tar 1 leel bounces in land
ing at the feet of midfielder Matt Craw-
lord. Ferris had no chance at get
ting a hand on the ensuing blast.
"Ii wasn't luck," Simon said.
"They got those two goals with
great skills and they were wonder
ful plays."
No, it was not luck that brought
North Carolina back from a two
goal deficit.
Rather, as Cell said, "it was just
all heart."
But a little luck might have
gone a long way for the Cardinal.
"All season we talked about
heading down on the ball, but that
one just went a little high,"
Levesque said of his missed oppor
tunity in overtime.
His shot was a little high, and
Mali/as was a little wide. And
North Carolina goalkeeper
Michael Ueltschey's soaring kick
in the forth overtime was <1 little
high lor Morrison to defend, so it
bounced toward Cell.
(Jell's shot was all too accurate.
"I think what happened was that

they played a ball right down the
gut, something we had seen all
game, something we had seen all
year," said defender Todd Duni
vant. "The ball just managed to get
over Lee's head and we probably
exntld 1 lave dc>ne a better jc>b <)f cov
ering. 1 went in to fight for the ball,
the keeper came out — it was just
unlucky and [Cell] got a good touch
on it and was able to put it away."
In part, the comeback can be at
tributed to North Carolina's expe
rience and determination. It was
the Heels' third consecutive over
time victory in the tournament,
and seniors like I eltschey, Leitch
and No/ Yamauchi showed wh\
character was considered one ol
their team's defining attributes.
Yet Stanford battled just as
hard, wanted the win just as much.
"I'm very proud of our guys,
every one of them," Simon said
after the game. " I his game meant
everything to them, and they
played their best."
But when two evenly matched
teams are both playing their best,
as they were in Columbus on Dec .
14, a few inches in either direction
can make all the difference.
