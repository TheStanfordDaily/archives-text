# Great season capped off by National title

Even without the national title, this would have
been a championship season for the Stanford
women's volleyball team.

Cardinal faced the nation's toughest schedule in 2001
with 18 matches against ranked opponents.

the top 10 all season and four other squads in the
conference always capable of a big upset, Stanford's
Pac-10 schedule would've been challenging enough
on its own.
And all this was under the guidance of a new head
coach who had only been hired a couple weeks before
the Cardinal's preseason practices started.

squad at the outset of the season, the team's stated goal
of a national championship may have seemed far
fetched to many.
Rest assured, the Cardinal was more than happy to
prove the unbelievers wrong.
" This is a really neat group of 14 players," said head
coach John Dunning, in his first year at Stanford after
16 at the University of the Pacific. "They did a g<x>d
job together with a new coach who they didn't know if
he knew anything or not. I can't say how hard this
team worked."
