# Great season capped off by National title
## Under a new coach, the Cardinal improved on its 19-12 2000 season to claim the top spot in the country 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
Even without the national title, this would have
been a championship season for the Stanford
women's volleyball team.
Of course, no one is going to mind (hat fifth
championship banner that'll be going up in Maples
Pavilion.
But the Cardinal's postseason run was merely the
cherry on top of an already sweet season for the Stan
ford volleyball program.
(doming off a forgettable 19-12 season last year, the
Cardinal faced the nation's toughest schedule in 2001
with 18 matches against ranked opponents.
With four teams from the Pacific 10 Conference in
the top 10 all season and four other squads in the
conference always capable of a big upset, Stanford's
Pac-10 schedule would've been challenging enough
on its own.
And all this was under the guidance of a new head
coach who had only been hired a couple weeks before
the Cardinal's preseason practices started.
With all of this standing in the face of the Stanford
squad at the outset of the season, the team's stated goal
of a national championship may have seemed far
fetched to many.
Rest assured, the Cardinal was more than happy to
prove the unbelievers wrong.
" This is a really neat group of 14 players," said head
coach John Dunning, in his first year at Stanford after
16 at the University of the Pacific. "They did a g<x>d
job together with a new coach who they didn't know if
he knew anything or not. I can't say how hard this
team worked."

deserved not only for the team's
turnaround from last season, hut
for the transformation he guided
the team through this year.
I he Cardinal began the season
as a team that won by brute
strength, overpowering oppo
nents' attacks with a devastating
bloc king game and relying heavily
on its lethal offensive combination
of Ail-American left side hitters, ju
nior Logan Tom and freshman
Ogonna Nnamani.
Hut after weeks of effort during
its midseason practices, Stanford
finished the year as ;i finesse team.
B) season's end, the Cardinal boast
ed a balanced attack with five play
ers averaging over two kills per
game, and the team's digging and
bloc k recovery was on par with the
best defensive teams in the country.
Their numbers may not stick
out too much in the season stats,
but the five seniors on the roster
deserve a great deal of c redit for
leading the team's transformation

on the court.
Fifth-year senior setter Robyn
Lewis — theonl) player on the ros
ter to have already won a national
title, back in 1997 — ran the Stan
ford offense to perfection as the
year went along.
1 fer career bio at Stanford reads
like an anatomy book; a slew of in
juries sidelined her for most of the
last two seasons.
lint she returned this year for
one more run at a championship
ring, and her ability to keep the
Cardinal attack mixed while still
getting the most from Nnamani
and loin is one of the main reasons
she's graduating with another
piece of jewelry on her 112 inger.
"It's so sweet and so great [to
win m\ last year]," said Lewis, who
ends her career fourth all-time at
Stanford in assists. "It's a great way
to leave with a national champi
onship. It's an amazing feeling."
With Nnamani occupying the
outside hitter spot they shared last
season, seniors Michelle Chambers
and Sara Sandrik only saw plaving
time this year as defensive specialists.
But along with senior defensive
specialist Kmily Lawrence, these se

niors led the Cardinal's mid.season
defensive thrust, which turned
Stanford from a mere contender to
a national champion.
"We were doing a lot of new sys
tem stuff that I had brought in that
was a little bit different," Dunning
said. "But the longer you do it to
gether, the more you can do it
without having to talk a lot. It was
a growth we went through during
the season."
Senior middle blocker l ara
Conrad was one of Stanford's most
consistent players all season long.
She was second in the l'at-10 in
blocks per game, but by season's
end the team relied on her as much
for her attacking and serving as it
did on her blocking. Conrad fin
ished third on the team in aces and
kills, helping her earn l'ac-10 I lon
orable Mention honors.
The efforts of Conrad,
Lawrence, Sandrik and Chambers
kept them from becoming the first
senior class in 10 years to graduate
without a ( hampionship ring.
But of course one cannot over
look the individual efforts of lbm
and Nnamani in weighing the suc

She also turned in 00 service aces

"I had a dream one day that we
were going to win the National
Championship, but 1 didn't tell
anybody because if you tell your
dreams to someone, they might
not come true,' Nnamani said.
"Now I'm confessing that it's great.
