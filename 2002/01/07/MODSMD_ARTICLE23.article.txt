# Riley anticipated to fill Willingham's shoes

While silence from the Depart
ment of Athletics makes all discus
sion of the search fora new head
football coach only speculation,
Stanford athletic director Ted Le
land is purportedly set to name a
new coach as early as today.
A published report in the San
Diego Union-Tribune stated that
Mike Riley, fired Monday after
three seasons as head coach of the
San Diego Chargers, is the front
runner for the job. Riley was sup
posed to interview with Leland
yesterday on campus after a previ
ous meeting in Southern Califor
nia. If the interview goes well,
Riley could be offered the job.
The Department of Athletics
refuses to comment on the coach
ing search until Willingham's re
placement is announced publicly.
I lowever, with recruits scheduled
to visit campus this weekend, Stan
ford cannot afford to wait too long.
Maintaining continuity in the
recruiting process would be easy if
Stanford had decided to give ei
ther offensive coordinator Bill
Diedrick or defensive coordinator
Kent Baer the top job, as many
current players have requested.
However, Leland is apparently
looking past the two. After being
passed over, Diedrick recently an
nounced his intention to follow
Willingham to Notre Dame.
Speculation has also revolved

around Florida offensive coordi
nator Buddy Teevens. Teevens
was previously hired by Leland to
be the head coach at Dartmouth
where Leland was then athletic di
rector. After winning two Ivy
League titles with the Big Green,
Teevens moved to Tulane.
Teevens then moved to Florida
and spent three seasons with the
Gators under Steve Spurrier, who
resigned Friday to pursue NFL
possibilities.
Norv Turner, the Chargers'
current offensive coordinator and
the former head coach of the
Washington Redskins, is thought
to be the third "mystery" candi
date that sources have discussed.
Turner might still be hired to re
place Riley in San Diego, leaving a
move to the Farm unlikely.
Recent speculation, possibly
fed by a column in the San Jose
Mercury News, has indicated that
Leland might also be looking at
Steve Mariucci, the current head
coach of the San Francisco 49ers.
The 49ers' presence in the play
offs complicates this issue. Though
his professional success, national
persona and local ties might make
Mariucci the perfect candidate for
Stanford, he would be unlikely to
leave his team before the end of its
season. With Stanford in need of a
head coach as soon as possible, the
timing appears complicated.
While his time with San Diego
produced an abysmal 14-34 record,
including nine straight losses to end
this season, Riley is attractive for rea
sons similar to Mariucci's.
I lis NFL experience and seven
years working in the Pacific 10
Conference will help recruiting.
1 lis pass-happy offensive schemes
lit with the Cardinal personnel. I le
is known as a genuinely nice guy
who could survive the internal
scrutiny to which the Stanford fac

ulty and administration subjects
the football program.
And, it doesn't hurt that Stan
ford can afford Riley. Willingham
signed a contract with Notre Dame
worth a reported $1.5 million,
which could rise to $2 million if
certain bonuses are met. Some
within the Athletic Department
speculate that Willingham
wouldn't have lefi if Stanford had
matched the contract.
However, Leland has repeatedly
declined to pay any of his coaches
exorbitant salaries. Riley, who made
only $750,000 a year with the
Chargers, would lit the mold.
