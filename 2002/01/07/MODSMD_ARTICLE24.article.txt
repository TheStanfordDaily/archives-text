# Football's great season ends sourly
## 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
Randy Fasani added one more disap
pointment to his Stanford career in the Car
dinal's 24-14 loss to Georgia Tech in the
Dec. 27 Seattle Bowl: getting benched in his
last game as a collegian.
Stanford (9-3) finished 2001 on a low
note, losing not just its pride to the un
ranked Yellow Jackets (8-5), but head
coach Tyrone Willingham just three days
later to Notre Dame. Not that the former
contributed to the latter, but one cannot
help but wonder what taste the Cardinal's
uninspired play left in the departed
coach's mouth.
Fasani left no mistake as to his feelings on
the game. The Cardinal's fifth-year senior
quarterback did not play in the fourth quar
ter because of his inability to get Stanford
into the end zone.
"1 was very surprised [that I was
benched]," Fasani said. "They were pres
suring me but 1 thought I was playing a
good game. 1 had one bad pass in the dirt
and that was my only bad pass of the game."
He finished with 11 of 21 passes for 115
yards and no touchdowns or interceptions.
Fasani entered Stanford as the top high

school quarterback in the nation. After red
shirting his freshman year, he spent two
years behind Todd Husak and Joe Bor
chard and even spent playing time at tight
end and on special teams.
In 2000 he suffered a knee injury, forc
ing him to miss three games and play spar
ingly in several others. This year he again
injured his knee and missed four straight
contests.
"I'm not happy at all about my Stanford
career," he said. "I didn't play that much at
Stanford due to great quarterbacks. I didn't
accomplish what 1 knew 1 could. Hopefully,
I'll get the chance at the next level."
Fasani's best chance to score came on the
team's opening drive, where the Cardinal
had first and goal from the Georgia Tech
five. Fasani was given not so much as a
chance to put the ball in the end zone, as the
Stanford coaching staff chose to hand off
the ball on four straight downs, the final a
futile touchdown dive by junior Kerry
Carter from the one.
"I didn't necessarily agree with the play
calling," Fasani said. "They were overloading
the strong side, and we were running to the
strong side. 1 can audible but if 1 do and it

in the inaugural Seattle Bowl.
doesn't work 1 get in deep trouble."
This was just the most evident of
Stanford's missed opportunities.
After the Yellow Jackets scored
on their first possession, Stanford
could answer only with a field
goal, as Fasani could bring the
Cardinal to just the Tech 18.
Then in the third quarter Stan
ford again had first and goal in
side the Yellow Jacket five, but
redshirt freshman Teyo Johnson
could not hold onto Fasani's pass,
and Stanford had to settle for
three points one more time, giv
ing Georgia Tech a 17-0 lead.
"We were moving the ball," se
nior tailback Brian Allen said.
"We just need to go and get touch
downs instead of field goals."
Finally Stanford brought
sophomore quarterback Chris
Lewis into the game, and at first
the decision looked to be prof
itable. Lewis led an 82-yard touch
down drive, capped by a four yard
"Teyo Tossup." On the two-point
conversion he found junior Ryan
Wells in the back of the end zone
and made the score 17-14.
But that would be all Lewis
could do, and Stanford failed to
send its seniors out with a win.
"It was really hard walking into
of the locker room after the game
with a loss," junior defensive tack
le Matt Leonard said. "It seemed
like somebody died. I don't think
there was a dry eye."
just like in Stanford's previous
two losses, the opponent was able
to win by exploiting the Cardinal
secondary.
George Godsey passed for 266
yards and a touchdown, and each
of the Yellow Jacket scoring drives
was sparked by the Stanford cor
ners being beaten deep by Tech
receivers.
Kelly Campbell finished with
10 catches for 106 yards and two
touchdowns, one on two-yard re
verse with 1:29 left to ice the game
for the Yellow Jackets.

The inaugural Seattle Bowl
will likely be the only football
game to ever take place in Safeco
Field, home of the Seattle
Mariners, but that didn't bring
many fans to the stadium. The at
tendance was reported at 30,144,

but that number revealed tickets
sold, not tickets used.
Unofficial estimates of the
crowd hovered below 20,000, and
many wore the purple of the
Washington Huskies rather than
Cardinal red or lech gold.

ranked Yellow Jackets (8-5), but head
coach Tyrone Willingham just three days
later to Notre Dame. Not that the former
contributed to the latter, but one cannot
help but wonder what taste the Cardinal's
uninspired play left in the departed
coach's mouth.
Fasani left no mistake as to his feelings on
the game. The Cardinal's fifth-year senior
quarterback did not play in the fourth quar
ter because of his inability to get Stanford
into the end zone.
"1 was very surprised [that I was
benched]," Fasani said. "They were pres
suring me but 1 thought I was playing a
good game. 1 had one bad pass in the dirt
and that was my only bad pass of the game."
He finished with 11 of 21 passes for 115
yards and no touchdowns or interceptions.
Fasani entered Stanford as the top high

school quarterback in the nation. After red
shirting his freshman year, he spent two
years behind Todd Husak and Joe Bor
chard and even spent playing time at tight
end and on special teams.
In 2000 he suffered a knee injury, forc
ing him to miss three games and play spar
ingly in several others. This year he again
injured his knee and missed four straight
contests.
"I'm not happy at all about my Stanford
career," he said. "I didn't play that much at
Stanford due to great quarterbacks. I didn't
accomplish what 1 knew 1 could. Hopefully,
I'll get the chance at the next level."
Fasani's best chance to score came on the
team's opening drive, where the Cardinal
had first and goal from the Georgia Tech
five. Fasani was given not so much as a
chance to put the ball in the end zone, as the
Stanford coaching staff chose to hand off
the ball on four straight downs, the final a
futile touchdown dive by junior Kerry
Carter from the one.
"I didn't necessarily agree with the play
calling," Fasani said. "They were overloading
the strong side, and we were running to the
strong side. 1 can audible but if 1 do and it

doesn't work 1 get in deep trouble."
This was just the most evident of
Stanford's missed opportunities.
After the Yellow Jackets scored
on their first possession, Stanford
could answer only with a field
goal, as Fasani could bring the
Cardinal to just the Tech 18.
Then in the third quarter Stan
ford again had first and goal in
side the Yellow Jacket five, but
redshirt freshman Teyo Johnson
could not hold onto Fasani's pass,
and Stanford had to settle for
three points one more time, giv
ing Georgia Tech a 17-0 lead.
"We were moving the ball," se
nior tailback Brian Allen said.
"We just need to go and get touch
downs instead of field goals."
Finally Stanford brought
sophomore quarterback Chris
Lewis into the game, and at first
the decision looked to be prof
itable. Lewis led an 82-yard touch
down drive, capped by a four yard
"Teyo Tossup." On the two-point
conversion he found junior Ryan
Wells in the back of the end zone
and made the score 17-14.
But that would be all Lewis
could do, and Stanford failed to
send its seniors out with a win.
"It was really hard walking into
of the locker room after the game
with a loss," junior defensive tack
le Matt Leonard said. "It seemed
like somebody died. I don't think
there was a dry eye."
just like in Stanford's previous
two losses, the opponent was able
to win by exploiting the Cardinal
secondary.
George Godsey passed for 266
yards and a touchdown, and each
of the Yellow Jacket scoring drives
was sparked by the Stanford cor
ners being beaten deep by Tech
receivers.
Kelly Campbell finished with
10 catches for 106 yards and two
touchdowns, one on two-yard re
verse with 1:29 left to ice the game
for the Yellow Jackets.

The inaugural Seattle Bowl
will likely be the only football
game to ever take place in Safeco
Field, home of the Seattle
Mariners, but that didn't bring
many fans to the stadium. The at
tendance was reported at 30,144,

but that number revealed tickets
sold, not tickets used.
Unofficial estimates of the
crowd hovered below 20,000, and
many wore the purple of the
Washington Huskies rather than
Cardinal red or lech gold.

As he had done all season, redshirt freshman Teyo Johnson caught a "Teyo
tossup" in the endzone from sophomore Chris Lewis to close the Yellow Jack
et lead to 17-12.
Randy Fasani added one more disap
pointment to his Stanford career in the Car
dinal's 24-14 loss to Georgia Tech in the
Dec. 27 Seattle Bowl: getting benched in his
last game as a collegian.
Stanford (9-3) finished 2001 on a low
note, losing not just its pride to the un
