# Football's great season ends sourly

Randy Fasani added one more disap
pointment to his Stanford career in the Car
dinal's 24-14 loss to Georgia Tech in the
Dec. 27 Seattle Bowl: getting benched in his
last game as a collegian.
Stanford (9-3) finished 2001 on a low
note, losing not just its pride to the un
ranked Yellow Jackets (8-5), but head
coach Tyrone Willingham just three days
later to Notre Dame. Not that the former
contributed to the latter, but one cannot
help but wonder what taste the Cardinal's
uninspired play left in the departed
coach's mouth.
Fasani left no mistake as to his feelings on
the game. The Cardinal's fifth-year senior
quarterback did not play in the fourth quar
ter because of his inability to get Stanford
into the end zone.
"1 was very surprised [that I was
benched]," Fasani said. "They were pres
suring me but 1 thought I was playing a
good game. 1 had one bad pass in the dirt
and that was my only bad pass of the game."
He finished with 11 of 21 passes for 115
yards and no touchdowns or interceptions.
Fasani entered Stanford as the top high

school quarterback in the nation. After red
shirting his freshman year, he spent two
years behind Todd Husak and Joe Bor
chard and even spent playing time at tight
end and on special teams.
In 2000 he suffered a knee injury, forc
ing him to miss three games and play spar
ingly in several others. This year he again
injured his knee and missed four straight
contests.
"I'm not happy at all about my Stanford
career," he said. "I didn't play that much at
Stanford due to great quarterbacks. I didn't
accomplish what 1 knew 1 could. Hopefully,
I'll get the chance at the next level."
Fasani's best chance to score came on the
team's opening drive, where the Cardinal
had first and goal from the Georgia Tech
five. Fasani was given not so much as a
chance to put the ball in the end zone, as the
Stanford coaching staff chose to hand off
the ball on four straight downs, the final a
futile touchdown dive by junior Kerry
Carter from the one.
"I didn't necessarily agree with the play
calling," Fasani said. "They were overloading
the strong side, and we were running to the
strong side. 1 can audible but if 1 do and it


Senior Kerry Carter is stopped on the one yard line as Stanford is unable to defeat Georgia Tech
in the inaugural Seattle Bowl.
