# Stanford needs some coaching flava
## 
### 
I want Steve Mariucci. It's nothing sexual
or anything. He's an attractive guy it
you're into that, but he's starting to look
a little too much like Chandler from
Friends. In case you haven't seen the show
lately, that means fat.
Regardless, I want Mariucci here at Stan
ford.
Unfortunately, I think we have about no
chance. Stanford hiring Mariucci is about as
likely as NSync turning straight.
First, who would voluntarily leave THE
plum NFL job — coach of the San Francisco
49ers — to come to Stanford?
Stanford has me, but let's be honest about
the rest of this package. We'll pay more fora
new palm tree than we will fora football
coach.
And, when it comes to hiring a coach, it's all
about the scrilla.
That's what happened with my man Ty
rone. 1 wanted him to stick around Stanford
so he could coach my future son — the next
great Cardinal punter.
But, in the end, when the Notre Dame
mafia came calling, Willingham answered
famed Fighting Irish fan Regis Philbin with
an emphatic "yes." As in, yes, after seven years
of making only $750.000 in a land of dot-com
trillionaires, Tyrone does want to be a mil
lionaire. And, until he learns how to program

some sweet code, that's not
happening here.
I'd chip in a few bucks my
self to help the coaching
search, but unfortunately the
craps table came calling a few
too many times over break.
Mike Riley doesn't sound
like too bad of a guy. 111 fart he
sounds great... as a date .. .

for my little sister. Everyone says he's the
nicest guy. John Robinson, his former boss at
USC, said if you die and Mike Riley's not
around, you're not in heaven.
Nice. Fora nun.
1 don't want a nun here, or even a monk
for that matter. 1 want someone to lay down
the law and scare people. Someone with balls.
Willingham didn't overwhelm anyone
physically. In fact, he was a midget, a little
person, a munchkin, what have you. Hut he
had a gig. I le didn't smile. Ever.
He stood on the sideline in a pansy red
sweater vest and still looked like the hardest
sumbitch you've ever seen. 1 wouldn't want to
run into him at night in that weird New
Guinea sculpture garden near Roble.
Frankly, the garden is enough to scare me.
But, adding him might make me pee my
pants. He's got that kind of aura.
Who knows? I could change my tune if

Stanford hires Mike Riley and he leads Teyo
and Co. to a miraculous appearance in the
BCS title game next year. Shoot, I'd change
my tune if he led the Cardinal to the Human
itarian Bowl.
But if Stanford hires Riley, we'd have only
the second-least intimidating coach in the
country, behind Miami's Larry Coker.
And while Coker looks like a tanned Stuart
Little, his team is all attitude. Miami doesn't
need a badass coach. Other than quarterback
Ken Dorky, possibly the most boring college
football player alive, the Hurricanes ate a
group of ex-cons-in-waiting. Screw the sculp
ture garden, I'd be scared running into them
on a sunny day in the middle of White Plaza.
They're big and fast and surly.
Stanford's big and last, too. And we've got
some badasses on the team. But, until we start
arranging Faculty Ghetto hottub orgies for
recruits or playing with a blatant disregard
for all that is good and holy in the world, we
need to have a coach with some pep.
So, if we can't convince Steve Mariucci to
drive a lew miles down 101, we have to shift to
plan B.

about that wildebeest fur. He'll trade Alice and a
case of Mums for it, straight up.

country, behind Miami's Larry Coker.
And while Coker looks like a tanned Stuart
Little, his team is all attitude. Miami doesn't
need a badass coach. Other than quarterback
Ken Dorky, possibly the most boring college
football player alive, the Hurricanes ate a
group of ex-cons-in-waiting. Screw the sculp
ture garden, I'd be scared running into them
on a sunny day in the middle of White Plaza.
They're big and fast and surly.
Stanford's big and last, too. And we've got
some badasses on the team. But, until we start
arranging Faculty Ghetto hottub orgies for
recruits or playing with a blatant disregard
for all that is good and holy in the world, we
need to have a coach with some pep.
So, if we can't convince Steve Mariucci to
drive a lew miles down 101, we have to shift to
plan B.

Jonathan, a senior, would still like to contact Cris
about that wildebeest fur. He'll trade Alice and a
case of Mums for it, straight up.
