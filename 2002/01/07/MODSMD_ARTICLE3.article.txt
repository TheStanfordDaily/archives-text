# Instead of a reluctant turkey with a penchant for resume fraud...
## Notre Dame Lands a Willing Ham 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
()ver the holidays Tyrone Willingham
accepted a surprising birthday present
and Stanford athletic director led Le
land began a challenging New Year's res
olution: find the Cardinal a new head
football coach.
On Dec. 30 — Willingham's 48th
birthday — the seven-year Stanford
coach was introduced as the new head
coach at Notre Dame, just three days after
the No. 16 Cardinal's loss to Georgia
Tech in the Seattle Bowl.
Willingham claimed to be content on
the Farm when the Notre Dame job
opened early last month. He referred to

his candidacy fora job atop college loot
ball's crown jewel as "laughable." Yet
when Notre Dame again came knocking,
Willingham was lured by the Irish's sto
ried history, the (iolden Dome and a six
vear contract reportedly valued between
two and three million dollarsayear, more
than twice what he made at Stanford.
At VVillingham's first press conference
in South Bend, Ik- reminisced to the days
he spent as a boy watching Notre Dame
football, even sneaking out of his North
Carolina church on Sundays to watch the
Fighting Irish highlights.
" Those things, somewhere, were laced
in the back of my mind," Willingham said.
"To say it is a dream come true is true."
The position at Notre Dame's helm opened

Dec. 2, when Athletic Director Kevin White
fired coach Boh Davie after a 5-6 season.
VVillingham's name popped up on the
ensuing coaching search and the Irish
were granted permission by Stanford to
interview Willingham. I hat interview
never took place, and when White was re
buffed by his top choices, Oakland
Raiders' coach John Gruden and San
Francisco 49ers' coach Steve Mariucci,
White settled on Georgia lech's George
O'Leary.
Despite Willingham's statements to
the contrary, he apparently had his eyes
fixed on the Notre Dame prize from the
beginning.


MAI I bAYltb/Ihe btantord Daily
Three days after this press conference at the Seattle Bowl, head football coach Tyrone Will
ingham accepted a job as head coach at Notre Dame.
When White tailed Willing
ham to inform him that O'Lean
would he the Irish coach, Willing
ham told him "You're hiring the
wrong guy. You need to hire me.
You know you have to hire me."
I'hen, after ()'l.ear\ w as forced
to resign just five days later be
cause of lies in hisbiograpln con
cerning both his academic and
athletic achievements, White was
back at his rolodex.
Yet again Willingham was not
the first choice, as a series of oth
ers. including Washington's Kick
Neuheisel, reportedh turned
down White's offer before W ill
ingham got the call.

White will not have to worry
about Willingham's resume.
Willingham has led Stanford to
four bowl games in seven years
and holds a 44-36-1 record at
Stanford. He has twice garnered
Pacific 10 Conference coach of the
year honors and led the Cardinal
to the 1999 Rose Bowl.
The coach's stoic on-field de
meanor and disciplined approach
to coaching belies his relationship
with players, many of whom re
spect him as a father-figure and
praise his integrity and work ethi<
At Stanford Willingham demon
strated his ability to use the I ni
versity's strict academic standards
as a boon to the football program
In recruiting onl\ the nation's best
and brightest players.
Yet Willingham is leaving the
relaxed, low-publicity Stanford

program for one of sport's most
high-profile positions, and
many wonder if he is up to its
challenges.
Fora man w ho shies awa\ from
the spotlight, Notre Dame's na
tional television coverage, weeklv
pep rallies of more than 12,000
and huge Sunday press confer
ences will be a huge difference
from Stanford's sparselv attended
weekh press conferences. Kven in
Willingham s introduc tory con
ference he cut reporters short In
asking for an end to the questions.
Willingham's even move will
be under intense national sc ruti
nv. Notre Dame's alumni and
fans expect nothing less than a
national championship, and
Willingham's time to at hieve this
goal is limited.
Davie was terminated the vear

after ;i successful 9-3 campaign,
,iihl his winning percentage ;it
Notre Dame is .583, slightly better
than W'illingham's .549 percent
age for the (Cardinal.
A couple meager years in
South Bend and YVillingham
could find himself going the way
of Davie.
Bui Notre Dame provides op
portunities that W'illingham has
hoped for ever since he began his
coaching career.
In addition to gaining the abil
ity to recruit nearly any player in
the nation, an impossibility under
Stanford's academic guidelines,
as the first black head coach in
Irish history, W'illingham hopes
to carve new racial pathways in
college football. Mis hiring has
been repeatedly commended by
national civil rights leaders.

"Part of my philosophy is that
there's a greater good, that we're
out there to benefit not just your
self, that's important, but to bene
fit others," W'illingham said.
Still, home for winter break,
YVillingham's former players were
shocked to learn of his decision.
"I felt we had gotten by [the
rumors] and 1 was not expect
ing him to go anywhere," said
junior fullback Casey Moore. "1
found out the morning of the
31st, when I got up my parents
told me. One of my uncles had
seen it on Sports Center and
called the house."
The search for the next Cardi
nal head coach began the mo
ment W'illingham decided to
leave. The athletic department
has stated it will make no an
nouncement until a new leader is

decided upon, and Leland basal
ready embarked on ;i journey to
find Stanford's next coach.
Whoever lands next year's job
as head Cardinal will have W'ill
ingham to thank for the added ex
pectations. During his tenure
W'illingham has taken Stanford
from an over•achieving team
happy with a winning season and
a Big Game vie ton over Califor
nia to a l'ac-10 power capable of
landing top recruits and challeng
ing the nation's top teams.
"What Coach W'illingham
began at Stanford is something
that is here to last." Moore said.
"I le is a winner in all areas of life
and those of us that will be leading
this team in the future are fully ca
pable of carrying on that winning
attitude no matter who the new
coach is."
