()ver the holidays Tyrone Willingham
accepted a surprising birthday present
and Stanford athletic director led Le
land began a challenging New Year's res
olution: find the Cardinal a new head
football coach.
On Dec. 30 — Willingham's 48th
birthday — the seven-year Stanford
coach was introduced as the new head
coach at Notre Dame, just three days after
the No. 16 Cardinal's loss to Georgia
Tech in the Seattle Bowl.
Willingham claimed to be content on
the Farm when the Notre Dame job
opened early last month. He referred to

his candidacy fora job atop college loot
ball's crown jewel as "laughable." Yet
when Notre Dame again came knocking,
Willingham was lured by the Irish's sto
ried history, the (iolden Dome and a six
vear contract reportedly valued between
two and three million dollarsayear, more
than twice what he made at Stanford.
At VVillingham's first press conference
in South Bend, Ik- reminisced to the days
he spent as a boy watching Notre Dame
football, even sneaking out of his North
Carolina church on Sundays to watch the
Fighting Irish highlights.
" Those things, somewhere, were laced
in the back of my mind," Willingham said.
"To say it is a dream come true is true."
The position at Notre Dame's helm opened

Dec. 2, when Athletic Director Kevin White
fired coach Boh Davie after a 5-6 season.
VVillingham's name popped up on the
ensuing coaching search and the Irish
were granted permission by Stanford to
interview Willingham. I hat interview
never took place, and when White was re
buffed by his top choices, Oakland
Raiders' coach John Gruden and San
Francisco 49ers' coach Steve Mariucci,
White settled on Georgia lech's George
O'Leary.
Despite Willingham's statements to
the contrary, he apparently had his eyes
fixed on the Notre Dame prize from the
beginning.
