# Women's volleyball claims fifth national title
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having to
dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a pair
of seemingly hopeless situations in the first two
games of ils NCAA semifinal match against de
fending champion Nebraska on Dec. 13. And
then it did it again in the first game against top
seeded Long Beach State in the championship
match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad somehow
prevailed.
Now the (Cardinal will raise another Nation
al Championship banner in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-0
win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the semi
finals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1) hopes
of an undefeated season with a stunning 3-0
win in the finals to claim the Cardinal's fifth
NCAA crown.
"This group has shown a remarkable abili

ty to stay relaxed this year," said Stanford
head coach |ohn Dunning, who was named
National Coach of the Year in his First season
with the Cardinal. "We were down in several
matches, down hopelessly at Arizona [on
Nov. 17]. They didn't panic and they re
mained patient, and they took advantage of
our serve, which was really on."
Fhe Cardinal's win against Long Beach
made for sweet revenge.

I he 49ers handed Stanford its first loss of
the season on Sept. 25. So naturally it was
the Cardinal's pleasure to return the favor
— especially with Long Beach being the
clear-cut favorite in most people's eyes head
ing into the final — and cut off the 49ers' bid
to post only the third undefeated season in
NCAA history.
