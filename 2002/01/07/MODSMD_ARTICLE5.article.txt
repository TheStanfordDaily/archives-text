# Women's volleyball claims fifth national title
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
For most teams, just playing in the Final
Four would be pressure enough.
But not for the Stanford women's volley
ball team.
For the Cardinal, after a season full of re
markable comebacks, no championship run
would have been complete without having to
dig out of a few more holes.
So, true to style, the Cardinal fell into a pair
of seemingly hopeless situations in the first two
games of ils NCAA semifinal match against de
fending champion Nebraska on Dec. 13. And
then it did it again in the first game against top
seeded Long Beach State in the championship
match on Dec. 15.
True to style, the Stanford squad somehow
prevailed.
Now the (Cardinal will raise another Nation
al Championship banner in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (33-2) posted an improbable 3-0
win over the Cornhuskers (31-2) in the semi
finals and then ended the 49ers' (33-1) hopes
of an undefeated season with a stunning 3-0
win in the finals to claim the Cardinal's fifth
NCAA crown.
"This group has shown a remarkable abili

ty to stay relaxed this year," said Stanford
head coach |ohn Dunning, who was named
National Coach of the Year in his First season
with the Cardinal. "We were down in several
matches, down hopelessly at Arizona [on
Nov. 17]. They didn't panic and they re
mained patient, and they took advantage of
our serve, which was really on."
Fhe Cardinal's win against Long Beach
made for sweet revenge.

I he 49ers handed Stanford its first loss of
the season on Sept. 25. So naturally it was
the Cardinal's pleasure to return the favor
— especially with Long Beach being the
clear-cut favorite in most people's eyes head
ing into the final — and cut off the 49ers' bid
to post only the third undefeated season in
NCAA history.

The Stanford women's volleyball team celebrates its fifth national title in San Diego.
1 he Beach's attack — which led
the nation with a .364 hitting per
centage during'the season —
could only muster a season-low
.198 mark against a fierce serving
and defensive effort by the Cardi
nal. Long Beach hit .384 in sweep
ing No. 4 Arizona (25-5) in the
other semifinal.
Meanwhile Stanford's .326 hit
ting performance was tfie highest
mark put up against the 49ers all
year.
Junior outside hitter Logan
Tom, named the Most Outstand
ing Player of the NCAA champi
onships, led all players with 25 kills
and 12 digs.
"Stanford had a pretty good
game plan setting a fast ball to the
outside to their two best players to
take advantage of our short block
on that side," said Long Beach
head coach Brian Gimmillaro.
"We didn't do enough to adjust for
that because there were enough
bad passes that we would be able to
score enough on those, but we
weren't able to score on those like
we usually do."
"[Senior setter Robyn 1 ,ewis] was
working it tonight. She was getting
good looks at the block and that
makes our job so much easier," said
lom, who averaged six kills per
game during the NCAA tourna
ment. "We needed that strength on
our side to beat them today."
The turning point in the match
came late in the first game as the
Cardinal posted its third come
from-behind game win of the Final
Four to hand Long Beach its only
first-game loss of the season.

The Cardinal had managed to
extend a 20-14 lead, but a big
blocking effort by Long Beach
brought the 49ers storming back
and got them to game point at 29-
27.
But the tide of the game, and
the match, turned as a pair of kills
and a block assist by Tom pushed
Stanford on a four-point run to
steal the opening game, 31-29.
"We talked in the huddle at the
end of game one that we wouldn't
know how they'd react if we came
back and won that game because
they hadn't lost a first game all sea
son," Dunning said. "I think
maybe that was motivation for the
group to make sure we went out
and got that."
The first game loss did get the
better of the 49ers, as Stanford
quickly got to game point in the
second game at 29-23.
Long Beach nearly pulled off a
Stanford-style comeback of its own,
lighting oil five Cardinal game
points. But senior setter Keri Nishi
moto put her next serve into the
net, giving Stanford a 30-28 win
«uul crushing the 49ers' hopes of
coming back in the match.
"99 out of 100 times Keri would
hit the target and not miss that
serve," Gimmillaro said. "T hat
could've been interesting at 29-28."
The Cardinal was clearly in con
trol of the final game, outhitting
the 49ers .385-.159 and outblock
ing them 4-1. A block by Tom and
sophomore middle blocker Sara
McGee sealed the championship
for Stanford with a 30-25 win.
Middle blocker Tayyiba 1 laneel
led the 49ers with 18 kills, but
Stanford limited All-American
outside hitter Cheryl Weaver —
who hit .441 with 4.61 kills per
game during the season — to just

seven kills and a .040 hitting per
centage.
Junior outside hitter Ashley Ivy
picked up three aces and eight
digs, giving her a team-high 21
digs and six aces in the Final Four.
Freshman outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani added 19 kills for Stan
ford while hitting at a .469 clip.
In the semifinals, Nebraska also
learned the hard way that no lead,
no matter how large or late, was
safe against the Cardinal.
A couple of late runs gave Ne
braska four game points in the first
game at 29-25, bringing the thou
sands of Cornhusker fans — who
made the contest a virtual home
match for Nebraska — to their feet.
But three kills from Nnamani
and strong serving from Ivy set
Stanford off on a devastating six
point run to pull out an incredible
31 -L >( .) (Cardinal win.
The Cornhuskers recovered
from the shot k of the lirst game loss
to build a 27-23 lead in the second,
only to have Tom single-handedly
destroy Nebraska's hopes of re
peating at national champs, loin
picked up five kills in a block in a 7-
1 run by the Cardinal to steal the
second game 30-2<S.
A seven-point run on Ivy's serve
in the third game guided Stanford
to a 30-21 win to end the affair.
"They put the pressure on us,"
said Nebraska head coach |ohn
Cook. "We didn't execute with
passing. Rally scoring, you get
down to close games, and you've
got to make plays down the stretch
if you want to win."
Ivy, Lewis and Nnamani were
named to the All-Tournament team
along with the MYT Tom. I laneef
and outside hitter Brittany
Hochevar were named to the All-
I ournament team for Long Beach.
