### JEFFREY TAM STAFF WRITER 
While many seniors are still worrying
about finding jobs or getting into gradu
ate school, two ofStanford's own already
know where they're going: Oeindrila
Dube, Class of 2000, and senior Nico
Slate were recently named winners of
the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.

I he Rhodes Schol
arship provides for two
years of study at Oxford
University in England,
and an optional third
year. It is highly com
petitive; Slateand Dube
won two of just 32
scholarships allotted to
American students

each year. Last year, Roxanne Joyal,
Class of 2001, received a Canadian
Rhodes Scholarship.
Dube, who was a public policy major
at Stanford, said, "I am very excited and
si ill very shocked." She said she is think
ing about getting a masters degree in
economics at Oxford, with the ultimate
goal of being able to affect American poli
cies on global economic development.

Slate also said he was
elated In his award and
was impressed with the
caliber of the candi
dates for the award,
whom he met during
the application proc ess.
"1 was honored to he
interviewed with so
many fascinating, in-

spiling candidates," he said. "It was very
easy to convince myself that I wasn't
going to be chosen."
Slate is currently double majoring in
earth systems and interdisciplinary stud
ies in (he humanities. 1 le is hoping to re
ceive a masters degree from the Envi
ronmental Change Institute at Oxford,
and intends to become a professor.
Stanford professors heaped praise
upon both winners. David Abernethy, a
politic al science professor, said of Dube's
award, "It's fantastic. She's just an out
standing scholar and human being. ()ne
of the fun things about teaching at Stan
lord is to get to know such students."
Donald Kennedy, former University
president and emeritus professor of envi
ronmental science, described Slate: "The
more you learn, the more you admire
and respect him, he's the real deal. It's
hard to believe he can have quite the
range of academic interests and the
depth of social consciousness that he has."

Oeindrilo Dube
While at Stanford, Dube was one
of the co-founders of the Student
Labor Action Coalition and in
volved herself with local labor is
sues like the lights of dining hall
workers.
By her junior year, 1 )übe's hori
zons had broadened to include in
ternational public policy as well,
partially because she grew up in
India and Kenya.
After Stanford, Dube worked in
Washington, D.C., at the World
Bank and Oxfam International as
a recipient of Stanford's John
Gardner Fellowship for Public
Service. Both Oxfam and the
World Bank work on resolving
world development issues, but
Oxfam often challenges the World
Bank's free-market based policies
as ineffective measures that leave
many poor countries with a heavy
debt burden.
"It was a very creative use of her
time," Abernethy said. "[She'll
have] an exciting future because
she'll be able to communicate be
tween establishment organizations
[such as the World Bank] and anti
establishment groups [like Oxfam]
in the area of third-world econom
ic development."
Currently, Dube is working at
the Brookings Institution, where
she produces papers on basic edu
cation in developing countries and
helps organize and host forums to
get members of Congress interest
ed these issues.
"I hope this scholarship will
empower me in many ways," Dube
said. "My goal is to do innovative
work no matter what institution
I'm at."
Slate also boasts an impressive
list of achievements. Since bis fresh

man year, he has been a counselor
for Quest, an educational and lead
ership outreach program for low
income students interested in the
environment.
Kennedy, who is affiliated with
the program, met Slate through
Quest and later became his honors
thesis advisor.
"He's just had an extraordinary
record here," Kennedy said, citing
Slate's honors thesis in the Gold
man Honors Program, where he
spun off his own non-profit organi
zation, Bridges to Home.
Kennedy said he also is amazed
that Slate is working on a second
honors thesis in interdisciplinary
studies in the humanities.
Slate said about his two majors,
"One of my favorite questions is,
what role can literature and philos
ophy play in tackling .. . social and
environmental problems? As an
earth systems major, I focused on
developing a broad understanding
of the causes and consequences of
environmental degradation. As an
interdisciplinary humanities
major, I was more interested in
how new poems or ideas can
change the way people act."
Slate also explained his organi
zation, Bridges to Home. "[lts] mis
sion ... is to connect educational
travel to domestic community ser
vice," he said. "By organizing trips
to countries where social and envi
ronmental problems are more visi
ble and where people's means of
coping are very different, I hope to
help travelers think more about
what they can do to improve com
munities in the States."
This winter break, the first batch
of low-income students in the
Bridges to Home program trav
eled to Vietnam.
With respect to bis future aspira
tions, Slate said, "I love learning
and teaching, and I see being a pro
fessor as the best way to do both."

environmental degradation. As an
interdisciplinary humanities
major, I was more interested in
how new poems or ideas can
change the way people act."
Slate also explained his organi
zation, Bridges to Home. "[lts] mis
sion ... is to connect educational
travel to domestic community ser
vice," he said. "By organizing trips
to countries where social and envi
ronmental problems are more visi
ble and where people's means of
coping are very different, I hope to
help travelers think more about
what they can do to improve com
munities in the States."
This winter break, the first batch
of low-income students in the
Bridges to Home program trav
eled to Vietnam.
With respect to bis future aspira
tions, Slate said, "I love learning
and teaching, and I see being a pro
fessor as the best way to do both."
While many seniors are still worrying
about finding jobs or getting into gradu
ate school, two ofStanford's own already
know where they're going: Oeindrila
Dube, Class of 2000, and senior Nico
Slate were recently named winners of
the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.

I he Rhodes Schol
arship provides for two
years of study at Oxford
University in England,
and an optional third
year. It is highly com
petitive; Slateand Dube
won two of just 32
scholarships allotted to
American students

each year. Last year, Roxanne Joyal,
Class of 2001, received a Canadian
Rhodes Scholarship.
Dube, who was a public policy major
at Stanford, said, "I am very excited and
si ill very shocked." She said she is think
ing about getting a masters degree in
economics at Oxford, with the ultimate
goal of being able to affect American poli
cies on global economic development.

Slate also said he was
elated In his award and
was impressed with the
caliber of the candi
dates for the award,
whom he met during
the application proc ess.
"1 was honored to he
interviewed with so
many fascinating, in-

spiling candidates," he said. "It was very
easy to convince myself that I wasn't
going to be chosen."
Slate is currently double majoring in
earth systems and interdisciplinary stud
ies in (he humanities. 1 le is hoping to re
ceive a masters degree from the Envi
ronmental Change Institute at Oxford,
and intends to become a professor.
Stanford professors heaped praise
upon both winners. David Abernethy, a
politic al science professor, said of Dube's
award, "It's fantastic. She's just an out
standing scholar and human being. ()ne
of the fun things about teaching at Stan
lord is to get to know such students."
Donald Kennedy, former University
president and emeritus professor of envi
ronmental science, described Slate: "The
more you learn, the more you admire
and respect him, he's the real deal. It's
hard to believe he can have quite the
range of academic interests and the
depth of social consciousness that he has."

Oeindrilo Dube
While at Stanford, Dube was one
of the co-founders of the Student
Labor Action Coalition and in
volved herself with local labor is
sues like the lights of dining hall
workers.
By her junior year, 1 )übe's hori
zons had broadened to include in
ternational public policy as well,
partially because she grew up in
India and Kenya.
After Stanford, Dube worked in
Washington, D.C., at the World
Bank and Oxfam International as
a recipient of Stanford's John
Gardner Fellowship for Public
Service. Both Oxfam and the
World Bank work on resolving
world development issues, but
Oxfam often challenges the World
Bank's free-market based policies
as ineffective measures that leave
many poor countries with a heavy
debt burden.
"It was a very creative use of her
time," Abernethy said. "[She'll
have] an exciting future because
she'll be able to communicate be
tween establishment organizations
[such as the World Bank] and anti
establishment groups [like Oxfam]
in the area of third-world econom
ic development."
Currently, Dube is working at
the Brookings Institution, where
she produces papers on basic edu
cation in developing countries and
helps organize and host forums to
get members of Congress interest
ed these issues.
"I hope this scholarship will
empower me in many ways," Dube
said. "My goal is to do innovative
work no matter what institution
I'm at."
Slate also boasts an impressive
list of achievements. Since bis fresh

man year, he has been a counselor
for Quest, an educational and lead
ership outreach program for low
income students interested in the
environment.
Kennedy, who is affiliated with
the program, met Slate through
Quest and later became his honors
thesis advisor.
"He's just had an extraordinary
record here," Kennedy said, citing
Slate's honors thesis in the Gold
man Honors Program, where he
spun off his own non-profit organi
zation, Bridges to Home.
Kennedy said he also is amazed
that Slate is working on a second
honors thesis in interdisciplinary
studies in the humanities.
Slate said about his two majors,
"One of my favorite questions is,
what role can literature and philos
ophy play in tackling .. . social and
environmental problems? As an
earth systems major, I focused on
developing a broad understanding
of the causes and consequences of
environmental degradation. As an
interdisciplinary humanities
major, I was more interested in
