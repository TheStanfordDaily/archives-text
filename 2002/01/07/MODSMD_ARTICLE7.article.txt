### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Vipin Narang, a masters student in
chemical engineering, was one of 40
American students to receive a Mat
shall Scholarship in November in
recognition of his academic perfor
mance at Stanford in chemical engi
neering and international relations.
The two-year scholarship will allow
Narang to study fora degree at a Unit
ed Kingdom institution of his choice.
According to the Marshall Scholar
ship program Web site, " The scheme
allows the Scholars, who are the po
tential leaders, opinion-formers and
decision-makers in their own country
to gain an understanding and appre
ciation of British values and the
British way of life."
Narang has chosen to study at Ox
ford University in the Department of
Politics and International Relations.
"Oxford has the greatest breadth of
any international relations program
in England," he said. "They have a
center which specializes in exactly
what I want to study."
Narang explained that he felt the

program would allow him to combine
liis knowledge of biochemical engi
neering with national security issues.
Stephen Stedman, director of stud
ies for the CISAC 1 lonors Program in
International Security Studies, ex
pressed confidence that the program
would benefit Narang.
" I'he Marshall scholarship is a
great fit for Vipin as it will allow him
the time to study international rela
tions in depth, with some of the
world's foremost experts in the field,"
Stedman said.
In particular, Narang said he has
a great deal of interest in defense
policy. He said he tried to exploit his
chemical engineering background
as it relates to this field as much as
possible in his application.
Narang said he felt the combina
tion of these fields is particularly rele
vant to current security issues.
"I only decided to apply to the pro
gram after the events of Sept. 11," he
said.
"A lot of the work th.it the [United
Nations] had done in this field was
pertinent before and it's even more
pertinent now," he continued.
Narang received his bachelor's de
gree m chemical engineering last
spring with a minor in international
relations and international security
