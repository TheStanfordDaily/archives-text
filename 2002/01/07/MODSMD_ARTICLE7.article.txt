# Marshall scholar Narang to combine skills in defense issues, chemical engineering
## 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Vipin Narang, a masters student in
chemical engineering, was one of 40
American students to receive a Mat
shall Scholarship in November in
recognition of his academic perfor
mance at Stanford in chemical engi
neering and international relations.
The two-year scholarship will allow
Narang to study fora degree at a Unit
ed Kingdom institution of his choice.
According to the Marshall Scholar
ship program Web site, " The scheme
allows the Scholars, who are the po
tential leaders, opinion-formers and
decision-makers in their own country
to gain an understanding and appre
ciation of British values and the
British way of life."
Narang has chosen to study at Ox
ford University in the Department of
Politics and International Relations.
"Oxford has the greatest breadth of
any international relations program
in England," he said. "They have a
center which specializes in exactly
what I want to study."
Narang explained that he felt the

program would allow him to combine
liis knowledge of biochemical engi
neering with national security issues.
Stephen Stedman, director of stud
ies for the CISAC 1 lonors Program in
International Security Studies, ex
pressed confidence that the program
would benefit Narang.
" I'he Marshall scholarship is a
great fit for Vipin as it will allow him
the time to study international rela
tions in depth, with some of the
world's foremost experts in the field,"
Stedman said.
In particular, Narang said he has
a great deal of interest in defense
policy. He said he tried to exploit his
chemical engineering background
as it relates to this field as much as
possible in his application.
Narang said he felt the combina
tion of these fields is particularly rele
vant to current security issues.
"I only decided to apply to the pro
gram after the events of Sept. 11," he
said.
"A lot of the work th.it the [United
Nations] had done in this field was
pertinent before and it's even more
pertinent now," he continued.
Narang received his bachelor's de
gree m chemical engineering last
spring with a minor in international
relations and international security
studies. He then spent the sum
mer in Geneva working with the
UN Institute for Disarmament
Research.
According to Stedman, Narang
is part of the first class of honors
students in international security
studies, an inter-school program
that offers students from any
major or school the opportunil)
to write a thesis and earn honors
in international security.
"The program is designed for
students like Vipin — outstand
ing students in their major who
want to use their expertise and
knowledge to contribute to the
stuclv of international peace and
security," Stedman said.
"Vipin was the first student in
the program from engineering
and the physical sciences, and he
chose to research the develop
ment of India's biological and
chemical weapons programs,"

he continued.
Narang is currently working
to receive a master's degree in
chemical engineering from
Stanford and plans to work to
wards a doctorate in interna
tional relations at Oxford.
"Ideally, I'd like to goon to work
in defense, in academia, or in a
think-tank," Narang said. "I would
also like to work in government."
Stedman had high praise for
Narang's work thus far.
" The faculty in tlie program
were so impressed with his thesis
that we awarded him the William
Perry Prize for the thesis that best
exemplified interdisciplinary re
search in international security,"
he said.
"My bottom-line evaluation of
Vipin is that he is one of the most
impressive students that Stanford
has ever produced —an under
graduate who was judged to be
the best student in an extremely
demanding major and who also
was a prize winner in an interdis
ciplinary honors program," Sted
man added.
