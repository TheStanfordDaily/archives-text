### SHANNA MCCORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Patricia Jeanne Semura, a
Stanford junior who loved sci
ence, music and skiing, died on
Nov. 29, 2001 in Portland, Ore.
The cause was non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, said her parents,
Jack and Pat Semura.

Patty Jeanne's
16-month battle
with lymphoma
started during
the summer of
2000, after she
completed her
freshman year at
Stanford. In
stead of partici-

pating in Sophomore College,
Semura had to stay home to re
ceive chemotherapy and radia
tion treatment.
According to the online jour
nal Semura kept throughout her
illness — even during some of
the most difficult times — she
was hopeful that she would beat
the cancer and return to school.
Senuira w as a member of the

Stanford ski team, of which she
was named rookie of the year in
1999. She started the sport at
age 1 1 and planned to work
with the ski patrol. She also
hoped to become a ski instruc
tor someday.
From singing to mastering a
number of instruments, music
was another passion in Semura's
life. She spent eight years singing
with the Portland Symphonic
(iirlchoir and learned to play the
piano, guitar, piccolo and drums.
Her piccolo playing secured
her a spot in the Stanford Band
during her freshman year.
According to her mother, Se
mura taught herself to play many
of these instruments.
"She would ask us to rent in
struments," Pat Semura said.
"We ended up having to buy a
drum set.'
Sports and music are not the
only things for which Semura will
be remembered; also remarkable
was her insatiable thirst for learn
ing. particularly sciern e.


Semura
She proved her ability and
dedication at the age of I 7 by be
coming a finalist in the Intel Sci
ence I alent Search, a national
competition that lias often been
t ailed the Nobel lM i/e ol science
lor I .S. high si hool seniors. Se
mura's research on computer
science and genetics led to her
selection as ;i finalist.
Semura's affinity for science
carried over into her academic
work at Stanford. As a Symbolic
Systems major, >>he was enthusi
astic about pursuing studies in
artificial intelligence as well as

cognitive science.
Those who lived in
Freshman / Sophomore College
with Semura say she was thrilled
to be a student at Stanford.
"She loved taking classes,"
said Morris Cohen, a junior
and close friend of Semura.
"She was really into what she
was learning. I'll never forget
her love of Stanford and of life
and how it overflowed."
According to her mother,
"what stands out most to me is
her depth of wisdom beyond her
years."
Semura's sharpness inside the
classroom didn't keep her from
enjoying time with friends and
other activities on campus.
"Having her walk into the

room randomly just to chat, that
was cool," Cohen said.
"Patty Jeanne was a warm,
kind generous soul who was in
clined to drop everything at the
drop of a hat to help a friend,"
said junior Kathryn Yu. "I
know, because slit* helped me
and many other people."
A foundation organized by
her parents has been set up in Se
mura's memory to fund educa
tional projects that can make a
difference in the world as they
say Fatty Jeanne did.
"She made a difference and we
want to carry that on as part of the
foundation," Pat Semura said.
