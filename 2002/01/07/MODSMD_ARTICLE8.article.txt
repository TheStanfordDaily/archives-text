### SHANNA MCCORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Patricia Jeanne Semura, a
Stanford junior who loved sci
ence, music and skiing, died on
Nov. 29, 2001 in Portland, Ore.
The cause was non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, said her parents,
Jack and Pat Semura.

Patty Jeanne's
16-month battle
with lymphoma
started during
the summer of
2000, after she
completed her
freshman year at
Stanford. In
stead of partici-

pating in Sophomore College,
Semura had to stay home to re
ceive chemotherapy and radia
tion treatment.
According to the online jour
nal Semura kept throughout her
illness — even during some of
the most difficult times — she
was hopeful that she would beat
the cancer and return to school.
Senuira w as a member of the

Stanford ski team, of which she
was named rookie of the year in
1999. She started the sport at
age 1 1 and planned to work
with the ski patrol. She also
hoped to become a ski instruc
tor someday.
From singing to mastering a
number of instruments, music
was another passion in Semura's
life. She spent eight years singing
with the Portland Symphonic
(iirlchoir and learned to play the
piano, guitar, piccolo and drums.
Her piccolo playing secured
her a spot in the Stanford Band
during her freshman year.
According to her mother, Se
mura taught herself to play many
of these instruments.
"She would ask us to rent in
struments," Pat Semura said.
"We ended up having to buy a
drum set.'
Sports and music are not the
only things for which Semura will
be remembered; also remarkable
was her insatiable thirst for learn
ing. particularly sciern e.
