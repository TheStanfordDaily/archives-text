THE PROGRAM IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY
is pleased to announce the following courses.
History of Computer Game Design: Technology, Culture, and Business
Lecturer: Henry Lotvood
Tuesday and Thursday, 2:15 - 3:05 in 380-380 C plus optional discussion section
Reading, discussion, reports, and projects on the developing culture and technology of computer and video
game design. Historical contexts include entertainment media, computing technology, applications of gaming
technology. Topics include play in human culture, the role of artificial intelligence research, the evolution of
techniques and game industries, and technology transfer (e.g., military simulations). Enrollment limited to 80.
Unroll in STS 145. 4-5 units
Technology, Body, and Work
lecturer: A. Aneesh
Monday and Wednesday, 4:15 - 5:30 in 60-61A
How does technology shape the structure and experience of work? Conversely, how do social and political
interests lead to particular work technologies? Exploration of management principles, production systems, and
related technologies as affected by such concerns. Focus on information technologies and the relationships
with the human body in contemporary work environments. Enroll in STS 175. 4 units
Intellectual Property and the Information Era
lecturer: A. Aneesh
Tuesday, 3:15 - 5:05 in 200-105
Intellectual property rules that evolved in the world of physical artifacts do not work well in the context of digi
tal programming and genetic sequencing. How do and should we resolve difficult intellectual property choices
posed by biotechnology, print and visual media, and the music industry. Enroll in STS 185, 4 units
The Wired Historian
lecturer: Michael John Gorman
Tuesday, 4:30 - 6:00 in Meyer 220
Essential skills and tools for teaching, research, and presentation. Topics: construction of effective web sites on
historical topics; online instructional materials; intellectual property and copyright on the web; creating and
using digital resources for historical research. Hands-on lab work and demonstrations. Digital media
resources available at Stanford. Each student carries out a digital project relating to his/her research or teach
ing interests. Enroll in STS 230. 3 units
Ethics and Public Policy
Professor: Datejamieson
Monday and Wednesday, 2:15 — 3:30 in 370-370 plus discussion groups
Ethical issues in science- and technology-related public policy conflicts. Develops the capacity for rigorous
critical analysis of complex, value-laden policy disputes. Topics: the natures of ethics and morality; the natures
of and rationales for liberty, justice, and human rights; and the use and abuse of these concepts in recent and
current policy disputes. Cases drawn form biomedicine, environmental affairs, the technical professions, com
munications, and international relations.
Enroll in STS 110. 5 units (Satisfies GFR:3a)
