THE AGE OF SCIENCE
BY GERARD PIEL
iraimi
"The Age of Science
is a remarkable effort.
Few people have done
what Gerry Piel has
done: undertake, with
high intellect and little
or no background,
to spend a life-time
learning about science
and then teach it
to others. They are
probably just the
right ones to do it!"

Editor-in Chief,
