"Mr. Addington's letter is a recognition that
Gongress and the public have a legitimate in
teresting in learning about contacts between
Knron executives and the White 1 louse," Wax
man said in a letter to (iheney.
KOl the past nine months, Gheney had re
fused to tell congressional Democrats Waxman
and Rep. |olui Dingell of Michigan which

power industry executives and lobbyists met

lorce last May recommended expanded oil and

"An employee oft he vice president's stall . . .

tives and reports that the) discussed energy
policy matters and did not discuss information
concerning the financial position of the Knron
Gorp.," the letter from Gheney's counsel said.
On Oct. 10, Knron announced huge losses,
t he first in a series of admissions th.it eventually
drove down the price of the company's stock to
less than a dollar a share.
Addington said Knron's financial condi
tion wasn't discussed at any ol the earlier five
meetings.
Gheney met with Lay lor hall an hour on
April 17 to discuss "energs policy matters, in
cluding the energy crisis in California," said the
letter, citing the only previously publicized
meeting between Knron and the vice president
or his stall.
I lie day after meeting with I .ay, ( hc-tiey said

the Hush administration would not support
price caps on wholesale energy sales in (Califor
nia, Waxinan noted.
In a separate encounter which the White
I louse did not count as a meeting, (Cheney and
Lay were on a panel June 24 at the American
Enterprise Institute World Forum in Beaver
Creek, Colo., where the topic was energy.
Addington said there was no discussion of
Enron's financial position.
"These meetings began on Feb. 22, just over
a month after the start ol the Bush administra
tion," Waxman said.
"They ended on ()ct. 10. just six days before
Enron announced the $1.2 billion in reduction
in shareholder equitv." he said. Waxman urged
an accounting of the contacts between Enron
and other White I louse officials in addition to
the energy task force.
I he White I louse letter says the other meet
ings between Cheney's aides and Enron offi
cials occurred on March 7, April 9 and Aug. 7.
