## The 						Stanford Daily Non-binding early admissions might resolve issues 
### 
Published Since IS')I

Last month, Yale President Richard
Levin provoked a whirlwind of con
troversy when he publicly called
upon fellow elite institutions to
scrap the early admissions process. In mak
ing his announcement, Levin cited concerns
that early admissions prematurely advances
the college selection process, benefits
wealthy students (who are more likely to
know about such programs) and discrimi
nates against financial aid applicants.
While Levin and other critics of early ad
missions make several valid points, their
gripes with the system could be addressed
without having to eliminate early admis
sions altogether. Instead, they could
change such systems from their current
binding nature to a non-binding one.
Early admissions, a process that has be
come wildly popular in recent years, espe
cially among wealthy, so-called "college
savvy" high school seniors, is a means by
which applicants can receive admissions let
ters from schools in mid-December, rather

than the traditional time of early April.
Most early admissions programs are
binding — that is, students who apply
under the early deadline may do so at only
one institution and, if accepted, are com
pelled to withdraw all other applications
and commit to that school.
Such a process works well for students
who are certain of their first-choice college
and who will not have to choose between
rival financial aid offers.
Many students, however, remain uncer
tain of their college choices as they enter
their senior year and feel pressured to
apply early for the edge that their peers
and guidance counselors say an early appli
cation will provide. Many of these students
rush to make uninformed choices with the
potential to lock them into a choice they
may not ultimately wish to make.
Prospective college students who apply
for financial aid often need to wait to re
ceive various aid offers before deciding
where to enroll. This need to wait pre

eludes them from applying to a program
that would bind them before seeing their
aid offer.
Despite these apparent negatives, early ad
missions comes with many important advan
tages. For students who are certain of their
first-choice school, it can eliminate countless
hours of essay-writing, hundreds of dollars in
application fees and months of worry.
From the point of view of the colleges, early
admissions helps them piece together their
freshman class with greater accuracy, as it gives
them a chance to identify potentially commit
ted students earlier.
For these reasons, American colleges and uni
versites should not scrap the early admission
sprocess altogether, as per Levin's suggestion.
Levin stated, correctly, that for Yale
alone to eliminate early admissions, with
out other elite institutions following suit,
would disadvantage Yale vis-a-vis its peers.
However, if Yale or any other university
is concerned about the deleterious effects of
binding early admissions — notably its in

controvertibility for students who change
their minds about college in the senior year
and the difficulty it places on students who
must weigh several financial aid offers —
they ought to consider the examples of
Harvard and Brown, who offer early but
non-binding admissions.
Two years ago, when Brown switched from
a binding to a non-binding early admissions
process, its applications spiked more than
those of any other Ivy League school. This
gave Brown more selectivity in choosing its
freshman class, as well as more flexibility for
students who felt strongly, but not certain
about attending the school.
If Yale or any other university wishes to
make the college applications process fairer
to over-burdened high school seniors (es
pecially to those who apply for financial
aid) while still keeping the benefits of the
process intact for admissions committees
and students who feel certain early in the
senior year, it should move to a non-bind
ing process.
