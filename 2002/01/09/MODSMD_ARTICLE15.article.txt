As we enter a new year, our natu
ral tendency is to look for signs
of progress in the preceding
year. We want to see milestones.
I nlortunately, the words to describe this
sense of political change — progressive
and liberal — have been smeared over
the past 50 years. As a result, we don't
dream the big dreams and we leave no
milestones to posterity. 1 hat leaves us
unable to answer the most important
question of them all: has our civilization
gotten any smarter?
1 lie answer is no.

We have become pro
tectors of the status quo.
()ur ruling philosophy is
laisscz fa ire capitalism.
However, this narrow
philosophy is < ontrary to
our own political history.
The previous century
brought us visionaries
such as Teddy Roo
sevelt, franklin Delano

Roosevelt, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson. Kach ol them furthered the
progressive dream started by Teddy
Roosevelt, who knew that life was more
than money.
Fetich Roosevelt rode this country out
of the starting gates and into a new cen
tury. He was president from 1901 to
1909. I lc ran again in 1912 as a candidate
lor the Progressive Movement. His plat
form guided big dreams for the next 50
years: minimum standards of industrial
safety and health; medical, old age and
unemplovment insurance; public owner
ship of natural resources; a progressive
income lax; government supervision of
tlu- sec urities markets; the creation of the
department of labor; and the prohibition
of c hild labor.
In.stead of dreaming big dreams, we try
to avoid being tagged .is a "card-carrying
member of the ACLU (George 11.V\.
Bush to Michael Dukakis) or a "thumb
sue king liberal (James Baker to a crowd
of summer asscxiatesin reference to peo
ple- who believe in the International ( rim
inal Court). Our own Herbert Hoover
once wrote of "fuzzy-minded totalitarian
liberals." I his name-calling has stifled our
confidence to chart the future and make
our country smarter than it was before.
Now. we have an MBA president. He
tinkers with the- economy and reacts to
world events. So far, he's providing solid
leadership in the- wake of the horrible c ar
nage of Sept. 11. I he problem is that he
lac ks a progressive agenda to take us to the
next level. I It 'll guard the status quo while
his political cronies throw a cage of disre
pute upon anyone who uses the word
"progressive" or "liberal" to describe his or

her political agenda.
The word "liberal" first started to
sound dirty around 1948 when the Pro
gressive Party asked the U.S. to pursue a
policy of accommodation with the Soviet
Union. Around 1950, the Progressive
Party opposed American intervention in
the Korean War. I his sounded the death
knell, as the progressives looked like a
bunch of pansies. Even today, "liberal still
sounds somewhat solt and un-American.
William Satire's Political Dictionary oilers
the following synonyms: Knee-jerk,
Pinko, Parlor Pink and Egghead. Howev
er, none of these synonyms would apply to
post-Cold War progressives.
1 he words "progressive" and "liberal"
should be rescued from political shenani
gans and restored to their former majesty,
(ieorge Washington described liberals as
generous and open-minded people. Ile
contrasted them with narrow-minded
people who wanted to deprive Jews and
Catholics of their civil rights. Earl Warren,
then-Governor of California and future
(Ihief Justice ol the Supreme ( lourl, wrote
this in 1948:
"I particularly like the term 'progres
sive.' lo me it represents true liberalism
and the best attitude that we could possi
bly have in American life. The reactionary,
concerned only with his own position, and
indifferent to the welfare of others, would
resist progress regardless of changed con
ditions or human need."
I he past 20 years have fallen under a
"reactionary" model, to use Warren's
words, in which each person has been con
cerned only with his own position.
LBJ was the of the Progressives.
His Great Society called for an end to
poverty and racial injustice. He made it
liappen, too. I lie Last of the Progressives
created Medicare, passed the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 and started what is now
the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. His vision suffered a slow
death. Bill (llinton put the final nail in the
coffin by dismantling federal welfare and
returning those responsibilities to state
governments.
In 2000, Bill Bradley ran as a progres
sive Democrat (he refused to characterize
himself as a liberal when asked at a de
bate), but he drew narrow support from
people with advanced university degrees.
It seems that progressives have lost their
popular appeal.
We should learn from our own past ex
perience as well as the experiences of
smaller, but smarter, countries like Nor
way and Sweden. Scandinavians believe in
social learning .They believe that society as
a whole can learn, develop and progress

into a better national community. We
should follow this philosophy. Progres
sives can guide us there while, at the same
time, improving our storecard relative to
other countries in the United Nations
Human Development Index.
Why does Sweden have more Internet
users (as a percentage of their popula
tion) than the U.S.? Americans devel
oped the Internet and the U.S. exports
the vast majority of high-technology
products. Why do 14 percent of Ameri
cans live below the income poverty line
while only four percent of Norwegians
and six percent of Swedes live under the
poverty line? Why does Norway have 413
physicians per 1 ()(),()()() people, Sweden

311 and Finland 299 while we only have
279 physicians per 1 ()(),()()() people? The
answer is soda! learning.
I here is more to politics than protec t
ing the status quo. We have I.BJ's War on
Poverty to finish. We have to fulfill Teddy
Roosevelt's dream of national health in
surance. We have to encourage female po
litical leadership. Only 14 percent of seats
in the U.S. Congress are held by women,
as opposed to 37 percent of seats in the
Norwegian legislature, 37 percent of seats
in the Finnish legislature and 43 percent
of seats in the Swedish legislature.
As we enter the new year, we should
think about milestones we can establish. In
doing so, we should wear the progressive
label with pride, scoffing at those who
would disparage the legacy ofTeddy Roo
sevelt, FDR, JFK and I.BJ.
We must dare to dream again.

Why does Sweden have more Internet
users (as a percentage of their popula

oped the Internet and the U.S. exports
the vast majority of high-technology
products. Why do 14 percent of Ameri
cans live below the income poverty line
while only four percent of Norwegians
and six percent of Swedes live under the
poverty line? Why does Norway have 413
physicians per 1 ()(),()()() people, Sweden

311 and Finland 299 while we only have

answer is soda! learning.
I here is more to politics than protec t

in the U.S. Congress are held by women,
as opposed to 37 percent of seats in the
Norwegian legislature, 37 percent of seats
in the Finnish legislature and 43 percent
of seats in the Swedish legislature.

As we enter a new year, our natu
ral tendency is to look for signs
of progress in the preceding

I nlortunately, the words to describe this
sense of political change — progressive
and liberal — have been smeared over
the past 50 years. As a result, we don't
dream the big dreams and we leave no
milestones to posterity. 1 hat leaves us
unable to answer the most important
question of them all: has our civilization
gotten any smarter?
1 lie answer is no.

We have become pro

The previous century
brought us visionaries
such as Teddy Roo

Roosevelt, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson. Kach ol them furthered the
progressive dream started by Teddy
Roosevelt, who knew that life was more
than money.
Fetich Roosevelt rode this country out
of the starting gates and into a new cen
tury. He was president from 1901 to
1909. I lc ran again in 1912 as a candidate
lor the Progressive Movement. His plat
form guided big dreams for the next 50
years: minimum standards of industrial
safety and health; medical, old age and
unemplovment insurance; public owner
ship of natural resources; a progressive
income lax; government supervision of
tlu- sec urities markets; the creation of the
department of labor; and the prohibition
of c hild labor.

liberals." I his name-calling has stifled our
confidence to chart the future and make
our country smarter than it was before.
Now. we have an MBA president. He
tinkers with the- economy and reacts to
world events. So far, he's providing solid
leadership in the- wake of the horrible c ar
nage of Sept. 11. I he problem is that he
lac ks a progressive agenda to take us to the
next level. I It 'll guard the status quo while
his political cronies throw a cage of disre
pute upon anyone who uses the word
"progressive" or "liberal" to describe his or

her political agenda.
The word "liberal" first started to
sound dirty around 1948 when the Pro
gressive Party asked the U.S. to pursue a
policy of accommodation with the Soviet
Union. Around 1950, the Progressive
Party opposed American intervention in
the Korean War. I his sounded the death
knell, as the progressives looked like a
bunch of pansies. Even today, "liberal still
sounds somewhat solt and un-American.

the following synonyms: Knee-jerk,
Pinko, Parlor Pink and Egghead. Howev
er, none of these synonyms would apply to
post-Cold War progressives.
1 he words "progressive" and "liberal"
should be rescued from political shenani
gans and restored to their former majesty,

contrasted them with narrow-minded
people who wanted to deprive Jews and

(Ihief Justice ol the Supreme ( lourl, wrote
this in 1948:
"I particularly like the term 'progres
sive.' lo me it represents true liberalism
and the best attitude that we could possi
bly have in American life. The reactionary,
concerned only with his own position, and
indifferent to the welfare of others, would
resist progress regardless of changed con
ditions or human need."
I he past 20 years have fallen under a
"reactionary" model, to use Warren's
words, in which each person has been con
cerned only with his own position.
