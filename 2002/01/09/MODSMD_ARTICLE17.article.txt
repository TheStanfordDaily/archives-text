Sophomores fear new
scooter technology
It has come to our attention that the
revolutionary scooter is on the brink of
sweeping the nation.
After reading your naively optimistic
review, we feel obligated as moral citizens
to caution your readers concerning the
sinister nature of "I I." ft seems praise of
"IT" goes fiu beyond the glowing recom
mendations quoted in your article.
We have spoken with one of the select
few who has ridden "I I. who shall re
main anonymous and will be hereafter re
ferred to as Johnny 11. for confidentiality
purposes. |ohnny lis most disturbing
comment to us was that it "is better than
sex!" While tfiis reaction may superficially
seem positive and harmless, it is important
to consider its far-rea< liing implications.
Picture if you will a lion ific future world
ofcelibate'Tl riders, slaves to "ITs" sexu
al prowess. I he.se c itizens of the dark
dystopia are sexually satisfied beyond their
wildest dreams merely by riding the rhyth
mic undulations of the super-scooter. Sex
ual intercourse, once considered the pin
nacle of pleasure, has become obsolete.
Once fertile lineages have dried up; once
virile man-stallions have been sapped of
their libido. The reproduction of the

human race has come to a screeching halt.
Now, dear reader, you may wonder
who would desire such an end. Simply
put, no one of earthly origin. At this
point it becomes clear: the futuristic and
revolutionary technology of "I I " obvi
ously beyond human capabilities, was
planted on Karth by a sinister race of ex
traterrestrial beings!
Fact: I he SF TI labs at UC Berkeley
have information concerning unidenti
fied spacecrafts hovering above Stan
ford campus, but they don't want you to
know! Why? Seven Big Games, people.
Seven.
Fact: Genetically engineered black
squirrels, (lie very same ones that are
watching you from outside your window
right now, constantly collect data concern
ing undergraduate sexual behavior and
deliver it back to the Mothership via
miniature satellite dishes in the foothills.
These facts in mind, we are forced to
conclude that "I I " is a purely evil device.
Glearly, these aliens intend to cruelly
obliterate humanity so that they might
colonize our peaceful, God-fearing plan
et, harvesting our physically exhausted
bodies as pods for their tiny octapenised
alien babies.
Beware! If you see "IT,"run, don't
walk. And for the love of all things sac red,

don't ride "IT"!
I lave a great day!
