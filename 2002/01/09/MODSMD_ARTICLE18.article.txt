## Light based computers coming, solar system's first stars dwarfed our sun 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Anybody who has taken E 40
knows that semiconductors are
based on junctions that modulate
the amount of charge that can
flow through a point. Is such ma
nipulation now possible with
light? A researcher from Bell Lab
oratories thinks that if phototonit
crystals are used, the answer is
yes. These are crystals with nanos
tructures that develop band gaps
on the basis of electron move
ment. The movement of electrons
can be controlled by the amount
of light which is shined on them.
The idea was first developed in
19.57, but physic ists have doubted

its feasibility. With the develop
ment of diamond photocrystals,
the idea has become a practical re
ality. Potential applications in
clude optical fibers, nanoscopic
lasers and integrated circuits that
would produce ultimate optoelec
tronic miniaturization. In other
words, extremely smaller and
faster computers could be possi
ble.
The first stars in the Universe
were massive juggernauts, as
tronomers Richard Larson from
Yale and Volke Broon from Har
vard conclude in a recently pub
lished paper. According to com
puter simulations, the first stars
appeared between 100 and 250

million years after the Big Bang.
Because they evolved in an envi
ronment consisting almost entire
ly of hydrogen and helium, the
physics favored the creation of
bodies many times more massive
and luminous than the sun. The
downside was a shorter life span:
many of these stars went super
novae in barely three million
years. It was the radiation and the
heavy elements generated from
these explosions that became the
raw materials needed to form
smaller, longer lasting stars, and
eventually planet systems.
What caused the human
species to emerge? In his book
"Monkey in the Mirror", lan Tat
tcm sail proposes that our cognitive
ability is the key. Even though Ne
anderthals and previous lio
mitiids displayed learning behav
ior and cultural adaptation, this
phenomenon peaked with Homo
sapiens. Based on anthropological
evidence, l attersall further sug
gests that our capacity for lan
guage and art are exaptations:
they arose in one context before

being exploited in another. Homo
sapiens developed vocal tracts (or
speech almost 500,000 years ago
and modern cognitive abilities by
200,000 years ago, but they were
only fully unlocked some 60,000
to 70,000 years ago. 1 his view is

part of a greater redefinition of
how our species evolved. In ihe
past year, scientists have come to
agree that Neanderthals had big
ger brains and that Neanderthals
and Homo sapiens coexisted in time
— but not necessarily spat e — for
almost 60,000 years.
The genome of the bacteria
that causes bubonic plague has
been sequenced. Bubonic plague

is infamous in history as the cause
of 20 million deaths. Researchers
at the Wellcome Trust Sanger In
stitute near Cambridge, England,
and others published their find
ings in ()(tober edition of Nature.
1 lie biologists also gave insights
into how Yersinia f/estis, the
plague's scientific name, obtained
and discarded genetic segments
from other bacteria — clues to
how it may have developed its vir
ulence. (Currently the plague caus
es sporadic outbursts in develop
ing countries — infecting 3,000
people annually — and is deemed
a potential biovvai fare weapon.
Menstrual irregularities may
have correlations with diabetes.
Researchers have found that
women whose menstrual cycles
are irregular or more than 40
days apart have double the risk of
developing diabetes as compared
to women with normal cycles. The
connection may be linked to
polycistic-ovary syndrome, a hor
monal disorder that disrupts the
body's ability to metabolize sugar.
Women with irregular cycles

need not panic: doctors advise
that healthy diet and regular ex
ercise can prevent diabetes. In the
past decades, diabetes 11 (the non
hereditary type) has surged large
ly because of obesity.
Quantum mechanics says that
all atoms have distinct quantum
states at a given time. However, a
theory recently proposed claims
that this rule may not always
apply. This alternate phenome
non, called entanglement, occurs
when two atoms become intrinsi
cally entwined in a partnership
that, in theory, would remain un
broken across light-years. Polzick
and coworkers from the Universi
ty of Arhus in Denmark provided
support for the phenomenon by
passing a laser through two golf
ball-size clouds of cesium, which
trap atoms magnetically. Polzick
has postulated that the feat will
lead to further experimentation
and even applications in quantum
computing. Quantum computing
is an equally interesting subject
because, in theory, it would allow
the completion of calculations
deemed impossible today.

Menstrual irregularities may
have correlations with diabetes.
Researchers have found that
women whose menstrual cycles
are irregular or more than 40
days apart have double the risk of
developing diabetes as compared
to women with normal cycles. The
connection may be linked to
polycistic-ovary syndrome, a hor
monal disorder that disrupts the
body's ability to metabolize sugar.
Women with irregular cycles

need not panic: doctors advise
that healthy diet and regular ex
ercise can prevent diabetes. In the
past decades, diabetes 11 (the non
hereditary type) has surged large
ly because of obesity.
Quantum mechanics says that
all atoms have distinct quantum
states at a given time. However, a
theory recently proposed claims
that this rule may not always
apply. This alternate phenome
non, called entanglement, occurs
when two atoms become intrinsi
cally entwined in a partnership
that, in theory, would remain un
broken across light-years. Polzick
and coworkers from the Universi
ty of Arhus in Denmark provided
support for the phenomenon by
passing a laser through two golf
ball-size clouds of cesium, which
trap atoms magnetically. Polzick
has postulated that the feat will
lead to further experimentation
and even applications in quantum
computing. Quantum computing
is an equally interesting subject
because, in theory, it would allow
the completion of calculations
deemed impossible today.

Anybody who has taken E 40
knows that semiconductors are
based on junctions that modulate
the amount of charge that can
flow through a point. Is such ma
nipulation now possible with
light? A researcher from Bell Lab
oratories thinks that if phototonit
crystals are used, the answer is
yes. These are crystals with nanos
tructures that develop band gaps
on the basis of electron move
ment. The movement of electrons
can be controlled by the amount
of light which is shined on them.
The idea was first developed in
19.57, but physic ists have doubted

its feasibility. With the develop
ment of diamond photocrystals,
the idea has become a practical re
ality. Potential applications in
clude optical fibers, nanoscopic
lasers and integrated circuits that
would produce ultimate optoelec
tronic miniaturization. In other
words, extremely smaller and
faster computers could be possi
ble.
The first stars in the Universe
were massive juggernauts, as
tronomers Richard Larson from
Yale and Volke Broon from Har
vard conclude in a recently pub
lished paper. According to com
puter simulations, the first stars
appeared between 100 and 250

million years after the Big Bang.
Because they evolved in an envi
ronment consisting almost entire
ly of hydrogen and helium, the
physics favored the creation of
bodies many times more massive
and luminous than the sun. The
downside was a shorter life span:
many of these stars went super
novae in barely three million
years. It was the radiation and the
heavy elements generated from
these explosions that became the
raw materials needed to form
smaller, longer lasting stars, and
eventually planet systems.
What caused the human
species to emerge? In his book
"Monkey in the Mirror", lan Tat
tcm sail proposes that our cognitive
ability is the key. Even though Ne
anderthals and previous lio
mitiids displayed learning behav
ior and cultural adaptation, this
phenomenon peaked with Homo
sapiens. Based on anthropological
evidence, l attersall further sug
gests that our capacity for lan
