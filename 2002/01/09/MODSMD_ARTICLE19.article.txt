# Microsoft settlement pleases few

### CATHERINE CRUMP 
The Microsoft anti-trust settlement
reached in November pleased lew of the
main players other than Microsoft itscll
and the |nstice Department, whose settle
ment terms were probably not unrelated
to a change in administrations. While ear
lier proposed remedies — such as break
ing up the company — evoked criticism
from many in the business community,
Microsoft's competitors contend that the
now proposed settlement is too lenient,
imposing few real restraints on a compa
ny that has amply demonstrated its lack of
concern for the niceties of anti-trust legis
lation.
Now it is up to | udge (lolleen Kollar-
Kotcllv to decide whether to accept it.
Whenever the government proposes a
settlement in a civil antitrust suit, the
Tunney Ad requires that there be <i pub
lit comment period before the settlement
is accepted. I lie public's comments are
filed in court and are intended to help
Judge Kollar-Kotelly make her decision.
I'he Department ol |nstice filed its an
titrust case against Microsoft in May
Its primary allegation was that Microsoft
was using its dominance in the operating
system market to compete unfairly in
other areas < >1 software devel< >pmcnt. 1 lie
Justice department was especially con
cerned that Microsoft's integration of its
Web browser, Internet Explorer, into its
operating system was an unfair attempt to
undercut Netscape's market share. Also,
the Department of Justice objected to Mi
crosoft's use of exclusionary agreements.
These agreements prevented computer
retailers from using the products of Mi
crosoft's rivals as a condition lor obtaining
licenses for Windows. I liese actions pre
vented companies Microsoft collaborated
with from working with Microsoft s rivals.
The Department of Justice's con
tention was that these practices, added to
gether, would allow Microsoft to take
over new areas ol software development
as they emerged because of its operating
system dominance, rather than the quali
ty of its products. It feared that this would
stifle the competition that is supposed to
benefit consumers in the form of lower
prices, higher quality products and
greater choice.
After intense and contentious litiga
tion. Microsoft and the federal govern
ment, together with nine states, entered a

proposed final settlement of their an
titrust case on Nov. 0, 2001. Nine states
and the District of Columbia rejected the
settlement and are continuing their legal
light in court. I he federal settlement has
several major provisions.
112 irst, the settlement forbids Microsoft
from retaliating against companies that
distribute or promote non-Microsoft
middleware (browsers, e-mail clients,
media players, etc.) or operating systems.
Under the settlement terms, Microsoft
< annot refuse to reissue a license for Win
dows to a computer manufacturer who
includes both Windows and another op
crating system on the computers it sells.
Second, Microsoft is required to es
tablish and publish uniform pricing
rates for its operating system. It can give
better rates to high volume customers
who buy many operating licenses than it
does to low volume customers, but it can
not charge higher rates to those who
choose to distribute rival operating sys
tems as well.

I bird, Microsoft cannot sign contracts
with computer manufacturers barring
them from installing desktop icons, short
cuts and start menu entries for non-Mi
crosoft software. Furthermore, Microsoft
must allow others to install their own In
tel net access provider advertisements
when the computer boots up.
Fourth, Microsoft is not allowed to
make agreements requiring that software
developers and sellers not sell non-Mi
crosoft software. I his means that if inde
pendent developers work with Microsoft
on a project, they will not lose their abili
ty to work on non-Microsoft projects as
well.
Fifth, Microsoft is required to disclose
the interfaces its software programs use to
integrate with Windows. 1 his should
allow others to make software that is just
as well integrated with Windows as the
software that Microsoft itself produces.
Finally, the agreement requires that
end users be allowed to remove Microsoft
middleware programs. Microsoft should
make it possible for users to uninstall such
programs as Internet Explorer with the
same ease that they can uninstall other
software. Moreover, Microsoft is required
to make it possible for users to set the de
fault options on their computer to noii-
Microsoft software. I his means that users
will be able to have 11 I MI . documents au
tomatically displayed in other browsers

like Opera or Netscape.
The strongest supporters of the settle
ment are, not surprisingly, the Depart
ment of Justice and Microsoft themselves.
The Department of Justice claims the set
tlement will meet the dual goals of reign
ing in Microsoft's unlawful conduct and
preventing its recurrence in the future.
I he Justice Department asserts that the
settlement will increase the opportunity
of other software developers to c reate
products that will be competitive with Mi
crosoft products. It asserts that its provi
sions are adequate protection against po
tential retaliatory measures by Microsoft
against those who promote or develop
rival software.
Opponents of the Microsoft settlement
include many of its rivals in the computer
industry, such as AOL Time Warner, Sun
Microsystems and Oracle, all of which
lobbied states to reject the settlement.
The clitics make a number of argu
ments. First, they assert that the settle
ment does not punish Microsoft for past
misconduct. Some argue that Microsoft's
anti-competitive behavior led to the
demise of rival software developers, re
ducing consumer choice, for which Mi
crosoft should be punished.
Second, opponents argue that the
settlement's enforcement mechanisms
are inadequate. That is to say, some op
ponents believe that it will be difficult to
force Microsoft to abide by the settle
ment if it is entered, and that it would
therefore be ineffective in curbing the
anticompetitive behavior it was de
signed to deter.
Third, opponents charge that the pro
vision of the settlement that allows Mi
crosoft to withhold information from soft
ware developers, possibly compromising
the security features of Windows, is a
loophole that Microsoft will use to avoid
sharing vital information necessary for
optimum interoperability of software
with Windows.
Fourth, some claim the term of the set
tlement, five years, is too short to make up
for the innovation Microsoft has stifled
through its anticompetitive practices. Al
though Microsoft's penalty for not follow
ing the terms of the settlement is that the
settlement will be extended for up to two
additional years, opponents charge that
extending a settlement that has already
proven unenforceable is an inadequate
remedy.
These concerns and more will he- at
issue when Kollar-Kotelly decides
whether to accept the terms of the pro
posed settlement. I he judge is instruc ted
to accept the settlement only if it is in the
public interest. The comment period, oc -
curring right now, is designed to allow us
all to voice our opinions. I fere is how you
can submit your comments. They are due
by Jan. 25,2002.

Under the settlement terms, Microsoft
< annot refuse to reissue a license for Win
dows to a computer manufacturer who
includes both Windows and another op
crating system on the computers it sells.
Second, Microsoft is required to es
tablish and publish uniform pricing
rates for its operating system. It can give
better rates to high volume customers
who buy many operating licenses than it
does to low volume customers, but it can
not charge higher rates to those who
choose to distribute rival operating sys
tems as well.

I bird, Microsoft cannot sign contracts
with computer manufacturers barring
them from installing desktop icons, short
cuts and start menu entries for non-Mi
crosoft software. Furthermore, Microsoft
must allow others to install their own In
tel net access provider advertisements
when the computer boots up.
Fourth, Microsoft is not allowed to
make agreements requiring that software
developers and sellers not sell non-Mi
crosoft software. I his means that if inde
pendent developers work with Microsoft
on a project, they will not lose their abili
ty to work on non-Microsoft projects as
well.
Fifth, Microsoft is required to disclose
the interfaces its software programs use to
integrate with Windows. 1 his should
allow others to make software that is just
as well integrated with Windows as the
software that Microsoft itself produces.
Finally, the agreement requires that
end users be allowed to remove Microsoft
middleware programs. Microsoft should
make it possible for users to uninstall such
programs as Internet Explorer with the
same ease that they can uninstall other
software. Moreover, Microsoft is required
to make it possible for users to set the de
fault options on their computer to noii-
Microsoft software. I his means that users
will be able to have 11 I MI . documents au
tomatically displayed in other browsers

like Opera or Netscape.
The strongest supporters of the settle
ment are, not surprisingly, the Depart
ment of Justice and Microsoft themselves.
The Department of Justice claims the set
tlement will meet the dual goals of reign
ing in Microsoft's unlawful conduct and
preventing its recurrence in the future.
I he Justice Department asserts that the
settlement will increase the opportunity
of other software developers to c reate
products that will be competitive with Mi
crosoft products. It asserts that its provi
sions are adequate protection against po
tential retaliatory measures by Microsoft
against those who promote or develop
rival software.
Opponents of the Microsoft settlement
include many of its rivals in the computer
industry, such as AOL Time Warner, Sun
Microsystems and Oracle, all of which
lobbied states to reject the settlement.
The clitics make a number of argu
ments. First, they assert that the settle
ment does not punish Microsoft for past
misconduct. Some argue that Microsoft's
anti-competitive behavior led to the
demise of rival software developers, re
ducing consumer choice, for which Mi
crosoft should be punished.
Second, opponents argue that the
settlement's enforcement mechanisms
are inadequate. That is to say, some op
ponents believe that it will be difficult to
force Microsoft to abide by the settle
ment if it is entered, and that it would
therefore be ineffective in curbing the
anticompetitive behavior it was de
signed to deter.
Third, opponents charge that the pro
vision of the settlement that allows Mi
crosoft to withhold information from soft
ware developers, possibly compromising
the security features of Windows, is a
loophole that Microsoft will use to avoid
sharing vital information necessary for
optimum interoperability of software
with Windows.
Fourth, some claim the term of the set
tlement, five years, is too short to make up
for the innovation Microsoft has stifled
through its anticompetitive practices. Al
though Microsoft's penalty for not follow
ing the terms of the settlement is that the
settlement will be extended for up to two
additional years, opponents charge that
extending a settlement that has already
proven unenforceable is an inadequate
remedy.
These concerns and more will he- at
issue when Kollar-Kotelly decides
whether to accept the terms of the pro
posed settlement. I he judge is instruc ted
to accept the settlement only if it is in the
public interest. The comment period, oc -
curring right now, is designed to allow us
all to voice our opinions. I fere is how you
can submit your comments. They are due
by Jan. 25,2002.

The Microsoft anti-trust settlement
reached in November pleased lew of the
main players other than Microsoft itscll
and the |nstice Department, whose settle
ment terms were probably not unrelated
to a change in administrations. While ear
lier proposed remedies — such as break
ing up the company — evoked criticism
from many in the business community,
Microsoft's competitors contend that the
now proposed settlement is too lenient,
imposing few real restraints on a compa
ny that has amply demonstrated its lack of
concern for the niceties of anti-trust legis
lation.
Now it is up to | udge (lolleen Kollar-
Kotcllv to decide whether to accept it.
Whenever the government proposes a
settlement in a civil antitrust suit, the
Tunney Ad requires that there be <i pub
lit comment period before the settlement
is accepted. I lie public's comments are
filed in court and are intended to help
Judge Kollar-Kotelly make her decision.
I'he Department ol |nstice filed its an
titrust case against Microsoft in May
Its primary allegation was that Microsoft
was using its dominance in the operating
system market to compete unfairly in
other areas < >1 software devel< >pmcnt. 1 lie
Justice department was especially con
cerned that Microsoft's integration of its
Web browser, Internet Explorer, into its
operating system was an unfair attempt to
undercut Netscape's market share. Also,
the Department of Justice objected to Mi
crosoft's use of exclusionary agreements.
These agreements prevented computer
retailers from using the products of Mi
crosoft's rivals as a condition lor obtaining
licenses for Windows. I liese actions pre
vented companies Microsoft collaborated
with from working with Microsoft s rivals.
The Department of Justice's con
tention was that these practices, added to
gether, would allow Microsoft to take
over new areas ol software development
as they emerged because of its operating
system dominance, rather than the quali
ty of its products. It feared that this would
stifle the competition that is supposed to
benefit consumers in the form of lower
prices, higher quality products and
greater choice.
After intense and contentious litiga
tion. Microsoft and the federal govern
ment, together with nine states, entered a

proposed final settlement of their an
titrust case on Nov. 0, 2001. Nine states
and the District of Columbia rejected the
settlement and are continuing their legal
light in court. I he federal settlement has
several major provisions.

from retaliating against companies that
distribute or promote non-Microsoft
middleware (browsers, e-mail clients,
media players, etc.) or operating systems.
