### MELISSA MIAO 
Sck ial entrepreneurs at Stanford are re
defining what it means to be an entrepre
neur, as is evident in the many new sck ial
entrepreneurship programs ili.it have re
cently flourished at Stanford.
With the establishment of the Center
for Social Innovation at the Graduate
School of Business, the formation of so
cial innovation student groups and the
hosting of social entrepreneurship con
ferences in past years, there has been
widespread commitment to building a
generation of social entrepreneurs at
Stanford.
"Stanford students have been explor
ing how to apply technology and inno
vation to the social sector," said Rodney
Anderson, co-chair of the 2000 Confer
ence on Social Entrepreneurship. "A
wide range of courses and opportunities
being offered for undergraduate and
business school students lias increased
campus awareness of the power <>l en
trepreneurship to revolutionize the way
we address social issues."
As <ui additional outlet for the Stan
ford community to explore and ac tual
ize their desire to create social value,
BASES is hosting a business plan com
petition for social entrepreneurs at
Stanford â€” the BASES Social E-Chal
lenge. 1 his event will run parallel to the
established BASES E-Cchallenge compe
tition, providing similar entrepreneur
ship resources. The difference is that
they will be tailored specific ally towards
the creation of social and financial re
turn on investment.
"In every discipline at Stanford, from
I lie engineering and humanities schools
to the law and business schools, there arc
people who want to make a positive im
pact on the world," said Monica 1 ran,
one of the BASES Social E-Challenge di
rectors. "In light of the September 1 Ith
attacks, students have been re-evaluat
ing their personal missions and have
been exploring how they can use their
education to best contribute to society.
There are very few venues outside of
academic institutions that make it so
easy for such diverse and skilled peo pie
to collaborate with one another."
Students will have the opportu
nity to present their ideas before
a judging panel, which consists of
direc tors of regional foundations
and venture p h ila nt h ropy
groups. Some foundations, in
cluding Ihe Tides Foundation
and Community Foundation Sili
con Valley, have established a
strong presence in supporting so
cially innovative organizations.
Other foundations being represent
ed are just getting started. I lie Draper
Richards Foundation is ;i new venture
philanthropy fund created b\ two ven
ture capitalists. Bill Draper and Robin
Richards Donohoe, that will focus on
seed grants for entrepreneurial non
profit ventures. I hey will be looking at

The BASES Social E-Challenge
will provide a support structure,
through mentor relationships and
workshops, for teams as they develop
their business plans and eventually
present these plans before the judg
ing panel.
There are many socially innovative
organizations that have stemmed from
a simple business plan with a unique vi
sion. One such organization, Ripple
Effects, is an award-winning learning
software company that helps children
change social behavior to improve aca
demic performance and reduce in
volvement in drugs, violence and risky
behaviors. Based in San Francisco, it
was recognized at a Haas Berkeley so
cial ventures competition in 2000; ef
forts to build the company were accel
erated soon afterwards.
"Stanford is an environment that fos
ters interaction between people with dif
ferent backgrounds and different skills
who become connected through com
mon interests," said Joel Segre, another
student involved in the Social E-Chal
lenge. "As such, it is an ideal environ
ment to incubate innovations that stem
112 rom students who aspire to c reate social
value. I his is one of the motivations for
the creation of the BASES Social E-C'.hal
lenge this year."
The kickoff event for the Social E-
Challenge will be held on Wed. Jan.
16th at I residder Union, Cypress
Room at 5:00 p.m. This event will pro
