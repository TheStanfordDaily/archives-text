## BCS squeaks by yet again 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
After an entire season of shocking upsets, rankings
controversy and not a little criticism of college foot
hall's absence from Brae ketville, the BCS did one
thing light for the fourth year in a row: crowned the
most deserving team as national champion.
Of course tlie critics will not Ik- silent, as college
football was just a Nebraska Rose Bowl victory away
112 rom anarchy, but no team has a claim on Miami's un
defeated goldmine. So the BCS can exhale, but when
the dust settles on Miami's 12-0 stampede, the real
question will be just who is the runner-up.
l he BCS does not release end of season rankings
apart from its No. 1, and both the AH and coaches
polls chose Oregon as No. 2 based on the Ducks 38-
10 drubbing of Colorado. But unofficial final BCS
standings on sites like Kspn.com fudged the com
puter rankings and had Oregon edging fellow BCS
bowl vic tors Tennessee and Florida by the slimmest
of margins.
T hat's just one issue.
Indignant parties such as Duck quarterback Joey
1 larrington and his coach Mike Belotti have assured
the press that they would have provided a much wor
thier opponent for the I furricanes. And the Oregon
faithful have all the evidence they need in the 112 luskers
37-14 performance, not to mention Nebraska's final
game of the regular season, a (*>2-36 loss to Colorado,
the Ducks latest victim.
Still, amidst .ill the hype and controversy, Oregon
used the B( IS bowls to outdistance all the other once
beatens and make its case fora playoff.
It's hard to imagine a more antic limactic ending to
an exciting season than the four BCS bowls. Fans es
caped the bowl season with their fingernails intact as
the smallest margin of vic tory was 13 points and the
closest any of the games were at halftime was two
touchdowns.

Rose Bowl
Miami's romp was an absolute bore. All season long
pundits chastised the Hurricane's cupcake early
schedule, hut in the end Miami devoured Nebraska,
who finished at No. 8 iu the AP poll.
T he consensus national champion is easily the
best team in school history, and many predict that
over half of this squad's starters could enjoy an
Nil. career.
Miami's defense smothered llusker quarterback
Eric Crouch, the Heisman award winner. Crouch
completed just five of 1 â€¢"> parses for 62 yards and an in
terception and ran for 1 14 yards as Miami jumped out
to a 34-0 halftime lead.
As to the notion that another team could have chal
lenged Miami, defensive end Jerome Me Dougle and
the rest of his I lurricanes have one repl\ to the folks
in Eugene: "We'll whoop the crap out of Oregon."
Fiesta Bowl
Playing two days before the Rose Bow I, ()regon did
its part to grab a share of the national c hampionship
if Miami was to lose.
Colorado scored first, and then Joey Harrington
led the Ducks to 38 straight points with four touch
down passes. ()regon's questionable defense found an
answer to the Buffaloes star sophomore rusher ( 1 n is
Brown, holding his to 30 yards on nine c arries.
Orange Bowl
AC X' champion Maryland, despite just one loss on
the season, showed itself as a true pretender in a :>O
- loss to Florida.
In what may wind up being Steve Spurrier's final
college game, the ()ld Ballcoach went out with a bang
and didn't even need to start Ins I leisman finalist sig
nalcaller. Rex Grossman roamed the sidelines in the
game's first 24 minutes for breaking curfew, but the
Gator's offense operated with such efficiency that
Spurrier himself probably could have thrown a few
(OIK ll(l( >W I) paSSCS.
Grossman came in with a 14-10
lead and proceeded to lead four
straight toiu hdown drives.
Sugar Bowl
SL(. champion LSI burst the
Big 10's huhble early and then

watched Illinois pla\ a futile ganu*
of catch up. I"he ' I'igers led 11-11
in the third (piarter in this hat tic of
stellar (juarterbacks and held on
for the 47-34 win.
Illinois record-setter Kurt Kit
tner threw lor 2f)2 vards and lour
touchdowns, but the Tiger's
Rohan l)a\e\ tossed three stores
and amassed 144 vards, a Sugai
Bowl record, to lead ISI to its
Tilth straight bow I \ ictoi \.
