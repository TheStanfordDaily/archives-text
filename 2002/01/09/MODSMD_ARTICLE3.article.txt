With a Four Seasons luxury hotel
set to open in 2004 and a Ta-loot tall
IKFA furniture superstore under
consideration, many residents of
East Palo Alto are questioning how
the city should use its valuable real
estate to boost tax revenue and im
prove the quality of life in the city.
Hie Four Seasons project has al
ready been given the go-ahead by
the Fast Palo Alto City Council,
which voted on Nov. 27 to transfer
rights to develop a hotel on the 12-
acre University ( in le development
to LDYV Resort & Hotel Develop
ment LLC of Fncitas, the San Jose
Mercury News reported.
LOW has an exclusive agree
ment with Four Seasons to operate
all of the hotels it builds.

The transfer to LDW is only the
latest in a long history of property
transfers and unfulfilled dreams
tor the site once known as Whiskey
Gulch.
The property, now renamed
University Circle, is located at the
southwest corner of University
Avenue and Highway 101. It bor
ders a residential community in
Palo Alto and also lies close to
Menlo Park.
In the early '90s, Whiskey Gulch
was a strip-mall of liquor stores, lo
cally-owned last food joints and
abandoned storefronts. At that time,
Adobe Systems considered the East
Palo Alto site for its world headquar
ters, according to Horizon Maga
zine Online.
But now, Linda Law of Univer
sity Circle Investors is developing
two office towers on the site, and
the construction of a luxury hotel
on the site is being turned over to
LDW.
I here would be 280 rooms in the
proposed Four Seasons, with room
rates running as high as $800 a
night, according to East Palo Alto
City Council member Myrtle Walk
er. The rates, prohibitively expen
sive for most East Palo Alto residents,
have caused controversy.
"I am in favor of a hotel, but I am
not in favor of a Four Seasons, five
star hotel," Walker said. "I would
like a hotel that would be accessible
to the community; this one is not."


KEITH ITO/The Stanford Daily
The soon-to-be Four Seasons luxury hotel, currently under construction at
University Circle in East Palo Alto, will boast 280 rooms and rates of up to
$800 per night. Some East Palo Alto city officials have raised questions re
garding the hotel's accessibility to local residents.
"I wanted a hotel we could put up
family in ... 1 seriously doubt I could
go in and buy a cup of collee at the
Four Seasons." site continued.
But theannual revenue expected
from the hotel — which the Mer
cury News estimated at about $3.1
million — makes some locals excited
lor the new development.
" That's $250,000 a month,
(ounc ilmember I )uanc Ba\ told the
Mercury News. " That's a police olli
cer with equipment every seven or
eight days, so let 's break ground and
get going."
Hut plans still are not certain for
the property.
With tightening corporate
budgets, dwindling numbers ol
dot-com multimillionaires and a
depressed travel market, the
Four Seasons may have trouble
finding enough guests to fill its
luxury rooms.
When asked about whether the
company was planning a hotel fot
the Fast Palo Alto site. Four Sea
sons Media Relations Manager
Aynsley Wintrip said, " There are
no plans that we are able to con
firm about a project in | Fast] Palo
Alto at this time."
Many Stanford students said
their parents would probably not
choose the Four Seasons over ho
tels that are located closer to the
Stanford campus when they visit
the area.
Some expressed concerns about
the safety ol the Fast l'alo Alto
location.
"1 would not stay there, because
part of the pleasure of going to a
hotel is its ambiance and part ol that
ambiance is the environment in
which it is located." said the mother
of a Stanford student, who said she
does not "feel comfortable" in Fast
Palo Alto.
Sophomore Katy Quarles
agreed,saying,"l know that my par

ents would love staying at the Four
Seasons, but that out of all the equal
ly-nice hotels in Palo Alto, they
would definitely not sta\ at the Four
Seasons | in Fast Palo Alto] because ol
safety concerns and because it would
be so faraway from restaurants and
from Stanford."
Other students made the point
that a trip to visit a child is not usual
ly a getawa\ jaunt to a l it/y hotel.
" 1 fyc>u're a parent visiting, you're
coining to hang out with your kid,
not enjoy a nice hotel, said sopho
more Dana Manriello.
Right across Highway 101 from
the Four Seasons site is the
Ravenswood 101 Shopping Center,
where the proposed IK FA wc>uld be
located.
On Dec. 0, the Fast Palo Alto City
(ouncil voted to allow city residents
to decide by referendum whether
they want an IKFA in the city.
Some residents have expressed
concern that the 320,000-square
loot store is too big lor a small town,
and others have complained that it
may bring too much traffic to I ligh
way 101 and University Avenue.
"If I KFA would have been willing
to scale clown, I would have looked
at it further," Councilmember Walk
er said.
"We had required all tenants to
adhere to adhere t<> design stan
dards that IKEA wasn't willing to fol
low." she said.
Fast Palo Alto resident Belinda
Rosales told the Palo Alto Daily
News, " The residents will be held
hostage to our community because
of the congestion."
But the tax revenue from the
store is sorely needed by the city,
lhe Emeryville IKEA, which
opened in April 2000, has generat
ed more than $ I million of tax rev
enue a year according to the Palo
Alto Daily News. Tax revenue esti
mates are similar for the Fast Palo
Alto store, and such a figure would
provide a huge boost to the city's
budget.
The IKEA referendum will go
before voters on March 7.
