With a Four Seasons luxury hotel
set to open in 2004 and a Ta-loot tall
IKFA furniture superstore under
consideration, many residents of
East Palo Alto are questioning how
the city should use its valuable real
estate to boost tax revenue and im
prove the quality of life in the city.
Hie Four Seasons project has al
ready been given the go-ahead by
the Fast Palo Alto City Council,
which voted on Nov. 27 to transfer
rights to develop a hotel on the 12-
acre University ( in le development
to LDYV Resort & Hotel Develop
ment LLC of Fncitas, the San Jose
Mercury News reported.
LOW has an exclusive agree
ment with Four Seasons to operate
all of the hotels it builds.

The transfer to LDW is only the
latest in a long history of property
transfers and unfulfilled dreams
tor the site once known as Whiskey
Gulch.
The property, now renamed
University Circle, is located at the
southwest corner of University
Avenue and Highway 101. It bor
ders a residential community in
Palo Alto and also lies close to
Menlo Park.
In the early '90s, Whiskey Gulch
was a strip-mall of liquor stores, lo
cally-owned last food joints and
abandoned storefronts. At that time,
Adobe Systems considered the East
Palo Alto site for its world headquar
ters, according to Horizon Maga
zine Online.
But now, Linda Law of Univer
sity Circle Investors is developing
two office towers on the site, and
the construction of a luxury hotel
on the site is being turned over to
LDW.
I here would be 280 rooms in the
proposed Four Seasons, with room
rates running as high as $800 a
night, according to East Palo Alto
City Council member Myrtle Walk
er. The rates, prohibitively expen
sive for most East Palo Alto residents,
have caused controversy.
"I am in favor of a hotel, but I am
not in favor of a Four Seasons, five
star hotel," Walker said. "I would
like a hotel that would be accessible
to the community; this one is not."

University Circle in East Palo Alto, will boast 280 rooms and rates of up to
$800 per night. Some East Palo Alto city officials have raised questions re
garding the hotel's accessibility to local residents.
