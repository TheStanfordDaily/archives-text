## Athletic Department calls press conference for 3 p.m. to introduce former Florida assistant 
### JONATHAN STULL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Just eight days after 'Tyrone Willingham left
for Notre Dame, Stanford has reportedly
found its man.
Buddy Feevens, the assistant offensive co
ordinator at the University of Florida, is set to
be introduced as the (Cardinal's 3 Ist head foot
ball coach today at 3 p.m., according to nu-

merous reports.
fhe Department of Athletics
refused to comment on the
coaching search until it makes
an official announcement.
While Mike Riley, the for
mer head coach of the San
Diego Chargers, was thought
to be the front-runner for the
position, all indications are

r
that Feevens, previously a head coach at Tu
lane, Dartmouth and Maine, is now Stan
ford's pick.
feevens, Riley and Cincinnati Bengals as
sistant |im Anderson all interviewed on cam
pus !< >1 tht' job. While it was reported that Norv

Turner, the Chargers' offensive coordinator
and former head coach of the Washington
Redskins, was scheduled to be interviewed,
that meeting never took place.
With the race down to Riley, who's suffered
through five straight losing seasons, and
Teevens, who was fired by Tulane in 1996 after
a 10-45 record in five seasons, apparently two
things helped push l eevens over the top: his re
lationship with Stanford Athletic Director led
Leland and his success at a school with similar
academic standards.
Leland hired l eevens to be the head coach at
Dartmouth in 1987, when he was the Athletic


Buddy Teevens
Director lor the Big Green.
Teevens, a 1979 Dartmouth
graduate, went on to win two
straight Ivy League titles in
New Hampshire before being
hired by 1 ulane in 1992.
I'eevens' first and last teams
in New Orleans finished 2-9
and his 1994 Green Wave
squad won only one game.
While I'eevens left without a
winning season, he did recruit
most of Tulane's 1998 team,
which finished a perfect 11-0
under Tommy Bowden.
After getting fired by lu
lane, Teevens moved on to be
come the offensive coordina
tor for Illinois in 1997 and
1998. Before the 1999 season,
Steve Spurrier lured him
away to Gainesville, Fla., to be
the Gators' new running
backs coach.
I'eevens paid immediate

dividends. In 1998, Florida
rushed for only 1 15 yards per
game and nine touchdowns.
Under I'eevens in 1999, the
Gators improved to 144 yards
per game and scored 17 touch
downs rushing.
I lis success was rewarded, as
Spurrier elevated I'eevens to
passing game coordinator, a
critical position in Florida's
pass-happy offense.
In his new position, the
Gators finished eighth in the
nation in passing yardage and
ninth in passing efficiency.
Florida also finished with
touchdown passes, in the top
three nationally.
Spurrier then promoted
him to assistant offensive coor
dinator in charge of the passing
game. Spurrier, noted as an of
fensive mind, remained as of
fensive coordinator.
This season, sophomore
quarterback Rex Grossman ex
celled under I'eevens, leading
the- Gators to a successful Or
ange Bowl appearand* and
a final N0.3 ranking. (iross
