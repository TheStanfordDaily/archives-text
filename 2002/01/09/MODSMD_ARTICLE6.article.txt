# Early decision applicants, admits on rise

### JENNIFER GRAHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid escalating controversy
over early admission programs at
colleges and universities nation
wide, Stanford accepted 558 appli
cants to the C'.lass of 2006 under its
Early Decision program last month
after receiving a record 2,392 early
applications.
Just days before these students
were notified, Yale University
President Richard C. Levin pub
licly called for top-tier colleges and
universities to terminate their
early admission programs,
spurring debate about a system
that some say has spun out of con
trol and become detrimental to
high school students.
The early admission numbers
for the Class of 2000 represent a
seven-percent increase from last
year in the number of students ad
mitted early, and a nine-percent in
crease in the number of students
who applied early. The acceptance

rate for early applicants dipped
slightly to 23 percent, from 24 per
cent last year.
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
mission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet said the increase in the
number of students accepted early
does not signal a c hange in what
the Admissions Office hopes to
achieve with its Early Decision
program.
"With Early Decision, we want
to admit no more than roughly
one-third of the c lass, and what's

really important is no more than
one-fourth of our total admits fare
admitted early]," Mamlet said.
Ultimately, the Class of 2006
will consist ofapproximately 1,600
students.
Mamlet said she is confident in
Stanford's Early Decision program
as it stands and added that I niver
sity administrators do not feel the
need to make any changes to the
program.
"1 believe that Stanford is
where we ought to be on this."

Mamlet said.
The recent controversy over
early admission began when Levin
publicly condemned such pro
grams as being unfair to students.
However, he added that Vale
would not unilaterally abandon
Early Decision because, as he told
The New York limes, "[Yale]
would be seriously disadvantaged
relative to other schools."
According to The New York
Times, Levin had approached the
presidents of other selective col
leges about ending their early ad
mission programs.
Mamlet, however, said Levin has
stated that he was misquoted on this
point, and she added that neither
she nor University President John
1 lennessy had been contacted by
Levin or Yale's Dean of Admission.
Since Levin's statement, Mam
let said there has been dialogue on
the issue within Stanford's admin
istration, but that it has been large-
