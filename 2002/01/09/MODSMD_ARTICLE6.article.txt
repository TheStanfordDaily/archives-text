# Early decision applicants, admits on rise
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid escalating controversy
over early admission programs at
colleges and universities nation
wide, Stanford accepted 558 appli
cants to the C'.lass of 2006 under its
Early Decision program last month
after receiving a record 2,392 early
applications.
Just days before these students
were notified, Yale University
President Richard C. Levin pub
licly called for top-tier colleges and
universities to terminate their
early admission programs,
spurring debate about a system
that some say has spun out of con
trol and become detrimental to
high school students.
The early admission numbers
for the Class of 2000 represent a
seven-percent increase from last
year in the number of students ad
mitted early, and a nine-percent in
crease in the number of students
who applied early. The acceptance

rate for early applicants dipped
slightly to 23 percent, from 24 per
cent last year.
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
mission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet said the increase in the
number of students accepted early
does not signal a c hange in what
the Admissions Office hopes to
achieve with its Early Decision
program.
"With Early Decision, we want
to admit no more than roughly
one-third of the c lass, and what's

really important is no more than
one-fourth of our total admits fare
admitted early]," Mamlet said.
Ultimately, the Class of 2006
will consist ofapproximately 1,600
students.
Mamlet said she is confident in
Stanford's Early Decision program
as it stands and added that I niver
sity administrators do not feel the
need to make any changes to the
program.
"1 believe that Stanford is
where we ought to be on this."

Mamlet said.
The recent controversy over
early admission began when Levin
publicly condemned such pro
grams as being unfair to students.
However, he added that Vale
would not unilaterally abandon
Early Decision because, as he told
The New York limes, "[Yale]
would be seriously disadvantaged
relative to other schools."
According to The New York
Times, Levin had approached the
presidents of other selective col
leges about ending their early ad
mission programs.
Mamlet, however, said Levin has
stated that he was misquoted on this
point, and she added that neither
she nor University President John
1 lennessy had been contacted by
Levin or Yale's Dean of Admission.
Since Levin's statement, Mam
let said there has been dialogue on
the issue within Stanford's admin
istration, but that it has been large-

ly informal.
"So far, there has been a fair
amount of conversation and that
conversation has caused us to reaf
firm Stanford's |>olic\she said.
Levin cited pressure felt In high
school students as the main reason
that early admission should he elim
inated, hut Mamlet said she feels
that ending Karl) Decision would
have the opposite effect.
"I agree that pressure on tal
ented high school seniors to gain
admission to top colleges has
reached an unhealthy level,"
she said.
"If early programs were
dropped, the process at a national
level would he characterized by far
more uncertainty."

Mamlet explained that students
would be forced to apply to around
20 schools as opposed to the five to
12 they tend to apply to now, and
that colleges would more frequent
ly use their wait lists, keeping man\
students in suspense until as late as
August.
Freshman Steph Neruda was
admitted early to the (llassol 200"),
and said she feels the program ben
efits students.
"If you find a first-choice st liool,
then you can show you're commit
ted to that school and you don't
have to worry about anything after
December," she said. "Kids don't
have to do it. It's not like it's a re
quired thing."
Other students, though, said
they felt pressure from their high
schools to apply early when they
were not ready, and therefore see
programs like Stanford's to be
harmful, as Levin has alleged.

"Karly decision is worst thing to
ever appear on the face of this
earth," said freshman Lance
Krieger, who attended a New |el-
se) boarding school.
"It made me feel that 1 had to
make a decision when I wasn't
ready to make the decision at the
cost of a lot of emotional freedom,"
lie said.
Krieger said that at his school,
students often forced themselves
to choose schools to appl) to early
merely to increase their chances of
admission.
"Pressure came from the col
lege advisors who basically told me
niv chances were great I)' improved
by applying early," he said.
Another major criticism of early
admission programs is that they
benefit students coming from elite
schools where college counselors
know the benefits of applying earl)
to colleges.

Mamlet said she I eels that this
may be a problem with some Early
Action programs, but said that
Stanford's Karl\ Dec ision program
did not have this effect.
"Does this play to the privi
leged? Yes. she said. "But 1 think
that ultimately thequestion is, does
it diminish the commitment to di
versit\ in the class? Stanford's com
mitment to diversity and students
on financial aid has never been
greater than it is now."
According to Mantlet, there has
not been a significant movement to
change early admission programs
at other elite colleges in the wake of
Levin s Decembei statement, and
that, short of a massive shift in the
policies of many other schools,
Stanford will not be influenced by
the (let isions of other universities.
"Stanford is going to make the
decisions that are right for Stan
ford," she said.

Levin cited pressure felt In high
school students as the main reason
that early admission should he elim
inated, hut Mamlet said she feels
that ending Karl) Decision would
have the opposite effect.
"I agree that pressure on tal
ented high school seniors to gain
admission to top colleges has
reached an unhealthy level,"
she said.
"If early programs were
dropped, the process at a national
level would he characterized by far
more uncertainty."

Mamlet explained that students
would be forced to apply to around
20 schools as opposed to the five to
12 they tend to apply to now, and
that colleges would more frequent
ly use their wait lists, keeping man\
students in suspense until as late as
August.
Freshman Steph Neruda was
admitted early to the (llassol 200"),
and said she feels the program ben
efits students.
"If you find a first-choice st liool,
then you can show you're commit
ted to that school and you don't
have to worry about anything after
December," she said. "Kids don't
have to do it. It's not like it's a re
quired thing."
Other students, though, said
they felt pressure from their high
schools to apply early when they
were not ready, and therefore see
programs like Stanford's to be
harmful, as Levin has alleged.

"Karly decision is worst thing to
ever appear on the face of this
earth," said freshman Lance
Krieger, who attended a New |el-
se) boarding school.
"It made me feel that 1 had to
make a decision when I wasn't
ready to make the decision at the
cost of a lot of emotional freedom,"
lie said.
Krieger said that at his school,
students often forced themselves
to choose schools to appl) to early
merely to increase their chances of
admission.
"Pressure came from the col
lege advisors who basically told me
niv chances were great I)' improved
by applying early," he said.
Another major criticism of early
admission programs is that they
benefit students coming from elite
schools where college counselors
know the benefits of applying earl)
to colleges.

Mamlet said she I eels that this
may be a problem with some Early
Action programs, but said that
Stanford's Karl\ Dec ision program
did not have this effect.
"Does this play to the privi
leged? Yes. she said. "But 1 think
that ultimately thequestion is, does
it diminish the commitment to di
versit\ in the class? Stanford's com
mitment to diversity and students
on financial aid has never been
greater than it is now."
According to Mantlet, there has
not been a significant movement to
change early admission programs
at other elite colleges in the wake of
Levin s Decembei statement, and
that, short of a massive shift in the
policies of many other schools,
Stanford will not be influenced by
the (let isions of other universities.
"Stanford is going to make the
decisions that are right for Stan
ford," she said.
Amid escalating controversy
over early admission programs at
colleges and universities nation
wide, Stanford accepted 558 appli
cants to the C'.lass of 2006 under its
Early Decision program last month
after receiving a record 2,392 early
applications.
Just days before these students
were notified, Yale University
President Richard C. Levin pub
licly called for top-tier colleges and
universities to terminate their
early admission programs,
spurring debate about a system
that some say has spun out of con
trol and become detrimental to
high school students.
The early admission numbers
for the Class of 2000 represent a
seven-percent increase from last
year in the number of students ad
mitted early, and a nine-percent in
crease in the number of students
who applied early. The acceptance

rate for early applicants dipped
slightly to 23 percent, from 24 per
cent last year.
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
mission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet said the increase in the
number of students accepted early
does not signal a c hange in what
the Admissions Office hopes to
achieve with its Early Decision
program.
"With Early Decision, we want
to admit no more than roughly
one-third of the c lass, and what's

really important is no more than
one-fourth of our total admits fare
admitted early]," Mamlet said.
Ultimately, the Class of 2006
will consist ofapproximately 1,600
students.
Mamlet said she is confident in
Stanford's Early Decision program
as it stands and added that I niver
sity administrators do not feel the
need to make any changes to the
program.
"1 believe that Stanford is
where we ought to be on this."

Mamlet said.
The recent controversy over
early admission began when Levin
publicly condemned such pro
grams as being unfair to students.
However, he added that Vale
would not unilaterally abandon
Early Decision because, as he told
The New York limes, "[Yale]
would be seriously disadvantaged
relative to other schools."
According to The New York
Times, Levin had approached the
presidents of other selective col
leges about ending their early ad
mission programs.
Mamlet, however, said Levin has
stated that he was misquoted on this
point, and she added that neither
she nor University President John
1 lennessy had been contacted by
Levin or Yale's Dean of Admission.

the issue within Stanford's admin
