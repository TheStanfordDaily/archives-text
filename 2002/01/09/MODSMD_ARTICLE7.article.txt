# Schneider to discuss global warming, politics
## 
### CAROLYN LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Biology Prof. Steven Schneider will address
the volatile environmental debate surrounding
climate change in a talk titled "The Global
Warming C Controversy: ('.an We Separate Scien
tific Signal from Political Noise?" this afternoon.
The talk, part of the C Computer Systems 1 .ab
oratory Colloquium, will be hosted by Electrical
Engineering Prof. Dennis Allison, who orga
nized the colloquium.
"My intention in inviting Steve to talk at a
Computer Systems Lab Colloquium is to show
something of the complexities and pitfalls of

science in ;i highly political environment," Alli
son said.
" There are methodologies and proprieties
which need to be observed when doing scientif
ic investigations," he added.
According to Allison, Schneider will also dis
cuss "some of his observations about the failings
of | Bjorn Lomborg's book,' 1 he Skeptical Envi
ronmentalist'] and the way by which scientific
investigations must be done in order to reach
defensible com lusions."
Computer scientist John Mashey, who has
studied Lomborg's work, will attend the talk as
a discussant.
"He'll be responsible for asking hard ques

lions," Allison said. "Much of his recent technical
life has been involved with large scale scientific
computation. My expectation is that he'll only
ask a lew questions, hill he will be prepared to do
so from the position of an informed scientist, but
a non-specialist."
1 he talk is scheduled to last one hour and 15
minutes and is one installment in the weekly
colloquium that covers topics within electrical
engineering and computer science.
Schneider's lecture begins at 4:1 5 p.m. in the
Gates Computer Science Building, room BOS.
