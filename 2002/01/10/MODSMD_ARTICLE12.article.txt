1971
On Jan. 0, 1 ( .)71 1 he Stanford Daily printed
an article about the breaking of Hoover
lower windows.
"'Since late last November at least 18 win
dows of the Lou Henry Hoover Tower
Building have been broken,' Alan Belmont,
Associate Director of Administration for the
Hoover Institute, said yesterday. 'Each win
dow's replacement cost is around $400.'
"Many buildings on campus have recent
l\ been defaced by vandals painting political
slogans.'()nly a few of the buildings on cam
pus have escaped defacement this past week,'
noted | Bruce Wiggins, University Security
Manager]. 'Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall, the
Graduate School of Business, Memorial Au
ditorium and the Undergraduate Library
are several of the buildings marred.'
"Rocks and railroad spikes have also
smashed windows in the Durand Aerospace
Building and the Physics tank."
The Undergraduate Library? Yes. It's ugly. But
HooTow? Where's the love?
