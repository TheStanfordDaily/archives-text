A new study rips apart the long
held notion that California \s great
whitesharks spend their lives hugging
the coastline, searching for sea lions
andseals to devour.
It turns out the sharks do what
many Northern Californians would
like to do when winter arrives:: they
head to the tropics.
Scientists from Northern Califor
nia tracking the migration of six
sharks found that one went to
Hawaii, three swam several hundred
miles west of Baja, but only two re
mained along the coast.
"I was shocked," said Bumey Le
Boeuf a noted University of Califor
nia-Santa Cruz biologist. "We just
didn't expect it. The sharks went
straight out across the open ocean,
diving to depths of 700 meters. In all
our observations before, they were
never observed below 100 meters."
The migration study used revolu
tionary technology: "pop-up " tags
inserted in the sharks that record
their position, depth, even the tem
perature of the water in which
they're swimming.
