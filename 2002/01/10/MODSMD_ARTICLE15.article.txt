## The 						Stanford Daily Limiting Latin American Studies a poor decision 
### 
Published Since IH9I

Stanford's decision lasi term to indefinite
ly halt the ability of the Latin American
Studies program to grant degrees was
shortsighted and academically regres
sive. Shutting down this prestigious, innovative
and needed program neither accounts for the
preferences of students and laculty nor accom
plishes any important goals for the University.
Latin American Studies addresses the needs
of those interested in studying Latin American
history, culture and politics in an in-depth, in
terdisciplinary manner. It also affirms the intel
lectual value of scholarship from and about this
area and people, which has been traditionally
ignored by academia.
Many students and faculty believe the deci
sion to end the degree-granting status of Latin
American Studies amounts to an unofficial ter
mination of the program. Students who were
not enrolled prior to the abrupt closure can no

longer graduate with a degree in Latin Ameri
can Studies.
I his is unfair, as they were not informed
that the degree-granting status was threatened
and were not given a chance to declare it as a
major. If more warning was given, then per
haps more students would have declared, al
lowing fora more accurate assessment of in
terest in the program.
I he Latin American Studies program was
widely regarded as one of the best in the
country. If a program or department were
weak, then the University would be well-ad
vised to consider closing it. But severely limit
ing a top-quality program like Latin Ameri
can Studies can only hurt the University's
overall reputatation and scholarship, espe
cially given the existence of similar programs
at Stanford's peer institutions.
I he decision severely affects the academic cli

mate at the University. It also calls into question
the level of administrative support for similar
programs.
Therefore, the worries and complaints of
Latin American Studies supporters are not iso
lated to current and prospective majors. All stu
dents who care about area studies can now only
wonder if another interdepartmental program
will be next: African and African-American
studies? Asian American Studies?
I'he main reason given for indefinitely halt
ing the program is that there are not enough af
filiated tenured faculty members to advise en
rolled students. Such rationale would apply
equally to other area studies programs.
The University has repeatedly expressed a
desire to diversify the faculty. Yet shutting down
a program like Latin American Studies that has
a high proportion of minority faculty affiliated
with it contradicts this goal. In fact, this is anoth-

er reason not to limit a program that historically
has been so important to the Stanford commu
nity, and especially to the Latino community.
Reinstating Latin American Studies as a cle
gree-granting program will ensure that the
program does improve as the University in
tends in a timely fashion. As well, it will set a
precedent toward consistent support for all area
studies programs.
If the University does not allow Latin Ameri
can Studies to grant degrees fora long time,
then it must present a clear timeline and a plan
of action to the Stanford community to make its
claims about the program credible and ensure
that it is not forgotten.
The prestigious nature of and consistent de
mand for Latin American Studies, as well as
the legitimate complaints by prospective ma-

jors who were not informed of the de
cision until it was too late to declare,
also merit an official statement by ad
ministrators and more transparency
and information regarding the deci
sion itself. It also speaks to the need for
greater openness for similar decisions

in the future.
We urge University President John
Hennessy and Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences Sharon
Long to reconsider Stanford's cur
rent position on Latin American
Studies and take tangible steps toward
conserving this much-needed pro
gram. Restricting it in this way not
only hurts a significant portion of stu
dents and faculty but also damages
the University's academic reputation.
