# RAREFIED AIR
## A 						resolution to keep 
### 
Today is Jan. 10. I make this obvi
ous announcement amid senses
of both pride and sadness, the
former because knowing the
date means that I still remembei how to
keep time, and the latter because knowing
the date means I have returned to <i world
where time matters.
I spent the past month in classic colle
giate style — catchingupon some ieading
in my engineering textbooks, running a
few lab experiments, reviewing the finer
points of Shakespeare . . . oh, who am I
kidding? Since Dec. 15, I've spent a whole
lot of time doing a whole lot <>l nothing.
My schedule over the holidays contained
approximately lour activities: sleeping,
watching television, eating cookies and

fudge and more sleeping.
Things were hum
ming along wonderfully
until one afternoon, in
order to take a break
from all that stressful
sleeping and watching
and eating, I plopped
myself in front ol the
computer and rediscov
ered a powerful addic-

lion to that paragon of the World Wide
Web's inanity: Ihe Internet (,)uiz.
I hose things are great fun! I mean,
where else could I have tin ned t<> make
the life-altering discovery that my hid
den superpower is Supei Speed, or that
Britney Spears is my innei rot k star, or
that I will be married by |ul\ 0, 200~>?
(Yes, these are all legitimate topics fbi
Internet quizzes.)
As I sat in fascination waiting fbi each
(juiz to spit out another life-revealing
nugget, the thought o<< urred to me that
there is only one thing more lam iful and
fluff-filled than I he Inlernel (.)uiz, and
that is (drum roll, please) I he New Yeai s
Resolution! Appropriatelv, there's even a
quiz that (overs that particulat subject.
Did you know that my tendency to "obsess
over particulat musicians foi a period ol
time and then move on" reveals that my
New Year's resolution ibis year should be
to "become a homeless wanderei ?"
When did New Year's l)av become
such a farce? Most holidays have some
sort of clear meaning, some obvious rai
son d'etre that inspires us to lake noti< eoi
the special day. Valentine's Day is a
chance to celebrate romance and the peo
ple you love. I he Fourth of July recog
nizes the country's independent e. Memo
rial Day, Day, Faster and Christ
mas ea< h have (lear purposes.
By comparison. New Year's Day see ins
like the red-headed step< hild. ()ill yearly
calendar is based on the earth's orbit
around the sun, but Jan. I itself has no sig
nificance in the grand astronomical
scheme. ()ne could make the strong argu
ment that New Year's Day would lx belter
observed on the day of an equinox or a sol

slice. We llip the calendar in January
merely because a lew thousand years ago,
the Roman Senate declared that it would
be so.
Ihe meaning behind New Yeats?
lime. Mow boring, how unoriginal. I'm
not saving that an evening and following
day punctuated by boisterous drunken
parties (and the inevitable recover)' from
sikh events) is ;i bad idea, but you have to
admit that |an. I lac ks the historical, politi
cal or religious substance of other holidays.
Yet despite my scolling at the random
ness <>l the ancient Romans, mv only true
gripe with New Yeats is the- aforemen
tioned phenomenon of making resolu
tions. I'm simply, I just don't understand
the point ot making promises that you
know you are unlikely to keep.
I c.tn certainly grasp the idea that wel
c otninga new \e,n provides humanity with
a good opportunity to relied upon the past
yeai s successes and failures, but why must
|.in. I be the most important da) of the
\eai to relied on lilt*? We all want to be
nicer people, make more money and be
more honest, hut personal c hange isn't as
eas\ as Hipping ,i light suite h.
January I gives us an exc use, an out. II
we lail, we onl\ have to < balk it up to an
othet one ol those silly promises. Nobody
evei reall) keeps their resolutions, do
they? (>1 c ourse not. We laugh and return
to lilt* as normal. Somewhere along the
wax to 2002, the new year morphed from
a grandiose opportunity foi change to a
mere pats\ foi our shortcomings.
()l course, iliis realization was quite
slow in c oming. I've spe nt mv laii share of
time coining up with things 1 want to
c hange about nnsell and written them
down faithfully each New Yeai s Kve with
every good intention of sti< king to them. I
can lieai myself in ages past: " I his is the
year I'm going to clo it. Relax! Lose
weight! Sticss less! Laugh more!" Do I
keep them? Nalt. ( hanging yourself is
hard enough without the added pres
siue — and subsequent excuse — ol the
new year.
So this year, I resolve simply to make no
lit m resolutions \re you with me? Rather
than be disappointed when next week
lolls around and we're not 20 pounds
lightei and a million dollars tidier, this
yeai let's ,||| take the gradual approach.
We'll make c hanges w hen we're ready and
at oui own individual paces.
After a holiday break tilled with glori
ous nothing, we're back at Stanford star
ing clow n a long winter road full of classes
and commitments. I.ife is complicated
enough without the addition of phantom
resolutions. I his time around, I'm going
to sit b.ic k and let the chips of 2002 fall
where they may.

On set on/1 thought, perhaps Sarah will makt
oar resolution: stay away from Internet quizzes
