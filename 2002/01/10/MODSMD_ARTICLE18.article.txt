Appendix letter cited a biased Web site
I read with interest Steve Doane's letter
in the Jan. 7 edition of Ihe Daily ("Ap
pendix does perlorm a useful function"),
and was entertained by the Web pages to
which lie rela ted readers fora "full dis
cussion of [the appendix's] usefulness".
Hut I was a bit disappointed that Doane
failed to mention some of the other fasci
nating bits of "information" which can be
found on the same site as those pages:
• I )inosaur fossils are only a few thousand
years old.
(www.answcrsingenesis.org/docs/3947.a5p)
• I he planet faith is only a few thousand
years old.
(www.answcTsingenesis.org/docs/40( 15. asp)
• I here was only a single "Ice Age",
caused by Noah's Flood.
(www.answei singenesis.ot g/does/21 H.asp)
Given that the Web site is maintained
by the Answers in Genesis Ministries, a
well-known creationist organization, it is
perhaps not surprising that such dubious
"fads" and "discussions" can be found
there. I lowever, I was surprised (and a bit
nauseated) to see Doane, in his letter, a< -
< use s< ientists of "quite often establishing
their own irrational dogmas because they
intensely want to believe a certain un
proven idea, or to save their reputations",
when the Web site to which he referred
people in support of his argument states,
at the top of its main page, th;it its goal is
"Upholding the authority of the Bible

from the very first verse!"
And in case this motto was somehow
ambiguous, in its Mission Statement
(www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/
about/mission.asp) the Answers in (ien
esis Ministries further states that its goal
is "To support the Church in fulfilling
its commission."
And finally, the "dogma" that this site
"intensely want[s| to believe" is stated
quite succinctly on its "Statement of Faith"
page (www.AnswersinGenesis.org/home/
area/about/faith.asp), where we are in
formed that " Ihe scientific aspects of Cre
ation are important, but are secondary in
importance to the proclamation of the
Gospel of Jesus Christ as Sovereign, Cre
ator, Redeemer and Judge".
I leave it to the reader to judge whether
Doane's accusations of bias and pre-judg
ment apply better to science and the scien
tists who engage in it, or to the organiza
tion he c ites to support his position. Hut
for those who are interested in the ac tual
science behind such issues, instead of "sci
ence" that has been sifted through a reli
gious filter, I would refer to you to the
I;llk.Origins Web site at www.talkori
gins.org. It contains much more reliable
(and better documented) information on
evolution and the creationists.

Spelling error shows 'sad state
of protest affairs'
I applaud lhe enthusiasm of Stanford
students who mobilize in order to protest

politics they feel are unjust. The photo
you ran on the front page of Tuesday's
edition unfortunately demonstrated the
somewhat s;id stateol protest aflairson the
whole at this time. The protester promi
nently pictured was holdinga sign that im
plored us in large block letters to stop
"sub-contacting," rather than to stop sub
contracting ;is most of the demonstrators
appeared to urge. Indeed, increased con
tact with causes that motivate us forward
to informed debate, rather than lackluster
participation, can only be for the ultimate
good of our growth as a society.
