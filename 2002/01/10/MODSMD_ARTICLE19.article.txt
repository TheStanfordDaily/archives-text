## 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) —
Shedding tears and getting
choked up at times, the burly
truck drivet who beat another la
ther to death .it their sons' hock
ex pratt ice testified yesterday
that the othei man took a swing
at him lirst and that he fought
bat kin sell-defense.
"I just wanted him to stop hit
ting me," said 44-year-old
lliomas Junta.
Junta said he landed only
three, oil-balance blows against
Michael Costin as the smaller
man snuggled beneath him on
the ground.
Junta wept when he recalled
tli.it several t liiltli en saw the fatal
light. Among them was his son,
Quintan, then 10, who testified in
his father's defense a day earlier.
Junta is on trial on
manslaughter charges in the
fight that broke out at a Reading
ice rink in Julv 2000 after ttie two
fathers argued over rough play
on the ice.
Prosecutors say the 6-loot-l,
270-pound delendant overpow
ered C'.ostin, who was an inch
shorter and weighed 1 10 pounds
less, and pumtneled him. Costin
never regained consciousness
antl died a tlav later.
During an aggressive cross
examination by prosecutor
Sheila Calkins, Junta said he
walked awav from the fatal fight
without checking to see il the vic
tim was hurt.
"I thought when he laid back
down that he was just resting,"

Junta testified, his voice choking
and chin trembling. "I didn't
know the man was hurt."
Junta faces up to 20 years in
prison if he is convicted. The case
has attracted national scrutiny
following what some say was a
wave of parental violence at
youth sporting events, and cable
news networks have carried parts
of the trial live.
Junta described how lie
grabbed Cost in after the other
man took a swing at him, then
how the two fell to the ground.
"I didn't know what that guy
was doing. Why was he even
jumping at me?" Junta said. "It
was crazy. I didn't know if lie had
something in his hands."
Junta said he was on his knees
and Costin lay in front of him tin
his back, trying to punch and kick
him. Junta saitl Costin held tight
to his wrist and refused to let go.
Calkins grilled Junta about
why he didn't try to walk away or
pause between the"three off-bal
ante punches" he said he landed.
"This is a 156-pound man
lying tin his back holding your
wrist and you want this jury to be
lieve you couldn't get away from
him?" she asked.
"Yes, I do, because that's the
truth," Junta said.
1 he prosecution's medical ex
perts have testified Costin was
beaten with such force that the
artery in the left side til his neck
ruptured. A medical expert for
the defense saitl that could have
been caused by a single blow.

Junta said he did not hear the
tries of two women who testified
earlier they had yelled for Junta
to stop hitting Costin and
warned that he was going to kill
the other man.
"The only thing I heard after
that was a little boy say some
thing," Junta said quietly, biting
bis lip and wiping his eyes.
Quinlan testified Tuesday that
he yelled at bis lather to stop. The
beating was also witnessed by
Costin's sons, who were not
called to testify.
Closing arguments are sched
uled for today.
1 he fatal fight was the second
altercation between the men that
day. Earlier, Junta had yelled to
Costin, who was supervising the
practice, because the play started
to get too rough. According to
witnesses, Costin told him:
"That's hockey."
The two scuffled after prac
tice. Junta said Costin, in full
hockey gear including sk.ites and
a helmet, lashed out and ripped
oil his gold chain.
He said Costin "bumped"
him, then the two grabbed each
other by the shirts and took
swings at each other, not really
landing any blows — "just
like . . . a regular hockey fight,"
he said.
|unta said Costin was going
"totally crazy," even after they
were pulled apart. He said
Costin was "spitting, drooling"
and continued to swing his arms
and curse.

Shedding tears and getting
choked up at times, the burly
truck drivet who beat another la
ther to death .it their sons' hock
ex pratt ice testified yesterday
that the othei man took a swing
at him lirst and that he fought
bat kin sell-defense.
"I just wanted him to stop hit
ting me," said 44-year-old
lliomas Junta.
Junta said he landed only
three, oil-balance blows against
Michael Costin as the smaller
man snuggled beneath him on
the ground.
Junta wept when he recalled
tli.it several t liiltli en saw the fatal
light. Among them was his son,
Quintan, then 10, who testified in
his father's defense a day earlier.
Junta is on trial on
manslaughter charges in the
fight that broke out at a Reading
ice rink in Julv 2000 after ttie two
fathers argued over rough play
on the ice.
Prosecutors say the 6-loot-l,
270-pound delendant overpow
ered C'.ostin, who was an inch
shorter and weighed 1 10 pounds
less, and pumtneled him. Costin
never regained consciousness
antl died a tlav later.
During an aggressive cross
examination by prosecutor
Sheila Calkins, Junta said he
walked awav from the fatal fight
without checking to see il the vic
tim was hurt.
"I thought when he laid back
down that he was just resting,"

Junta testified, his voice choking
and chin trembling. "I didn't
know the man was hurt."
Junta faces up to 20 years in
prison if he is convicted. The case
has attracted national scrutiny
following what some say was a
wave of parental violence at
youth sporting events, and cable
news networks have carried parts
of the trial live.
Junta described how lie
grabbed Cost in after the other
man took a swing at him, then
how the two fell to the ground.
"I didn't know what that guy
was doing. Why was he even
jumping at me?" Junta said. "It
was crazy. I didn't know if lie had
something in his hands."
Junta said he was on his knees
and Costin lay in front of him tin
his back, trying to punch and kick
him. Junta saitl Costin held tight
to his wrist and refused to let go.
Calkins grilled Junta about
why he didn't try to walk away or
pause between the"three off-bal
ante punches" he said he landed.
"This is a 156-pound man
lying tin his back holding your
wrist and you want this jury to be
lieve you couldn't get away from
him?" she asked.
"Yes, I do, because that's the
truth," Junta said.
1 he prosecution's medical ex
perts have testified Costin was
beaten with such force that the
artery in the left side til his neck
ruptured. A medical expert for
the defense saitl that could have
been caused by a single blow.

Junta said he did not hear the
tries of two women who testified
earlier they had yelled for Junta
to stop hitting Costin and
warned that he was going to kill
the other man.
"The only thing I heard after
that was a little boy say some
thing," Junta said quietly, biting
bis lip and wiping his eyes.
Quinlan testified Tuesday that
he yelled at bis lather to stop. The
beating was also witnessed by
Costin's sons, who were not
called to testify.
Closing arguments are sched
uled for today.
1 he fatal fight was the second
altercation between the men that
day. Earlier, Junta had yelled to
Costin, who was supervising the
practice, because the play started
to get too rough. According to
witnesses, Costin told him:
"That's hockey."
The two scuffled after prac
tice. Junta said Costin, in full
hockey gear including sk.ites and
a helmet, lashed out and ripped
oil his gold chain.
He said Costin "bumped"
him, then the two grabbed each
other by the shirts and took
swings at each other, not really
landing any blows — "just
like . . . a regular hockey fight,"
he said.
|unta said Costin was going
"totally crazy," even after they
were pulled apart. He said
Costin was "spitting, drooling"
and continued to swing his arms
and curse.
