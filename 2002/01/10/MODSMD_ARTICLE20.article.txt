## Welcome to the Farm, Teevens 
### 
The name Buddy Teevens probably
won't ring a bell in the head of even the
most knowledgeable college football
fan, but that doesn't mean he's not a
good choice to replace Tyrone Willingham as
head football coach. All in all, he is.
Stanford is not an easy place to coach or recruit
because of the institution's obvious academic
rigor, and T eevens seems ready and able to meet
the challenge. Having both quarterbacked and

coached Dartmouth to Ivy
League titles, T eevens is a man
suited to deal with the dual na
ture of the successful student
athlete found at Stanford.
As Leland put it at today's
press conference, Teevens is an
"educator, who happens to be a
coach," and not the other way
around — a vital characteristic

for any coach that wishes to continue Coach Will
ingham's legacy of molding his players into posi
tive, well-rounded, student-athletes.
To be frank there aren't many coaches across
the country that could lit the hill. Would Mike
Riley or Norv Turner (other names thrown
around as potential candidates) care as much
about all of the off-the-field components that
being a head coach at Stanford entails?
Also, you could get the sense today from hear
ing Teevens speak that he views his new oppor
tunity as the culmination ofa 23-year coaching ca
reer, and not as a stepping stone to either the
NFL or a more prominent, successful college pro
gram. Only 45 years old, Teevens conveyed the
feeling that he has coached at seven different
schools precisely to get I he chance as a head coach
at a school like Stanford, and he plans to establish
himself here for years to come.
Every coach would say the same type of thing
at his introductory press conference, but as naive
as this may sound, I believed him. In my view,
Teevens is poised to be here a real long time, as
long as the team gets it done on the field.
And on the field, the wide-open passing of
fense that Spurrier has passed on to Teevens in a
fanatical, quasi-religious way should be a perfect
fit for the Cardinal, given the make-up of both the
team and the Pac-10.
With Chris Lewis back at quarterback next sea
son. Teevens should have no problem coming up
with imaginative ways of getting Teyo Johnson,
Luke Powell and even Kerry Carter the ball out of
his multiple-receiver sets.
Needless to say, fans can get ready fora
high-flying aerial attack that, if it resembles
anything that Spurrier would come up with,
should be lighting up the scoreboard constant
ly next season.
I lowever, the game is played on both sides of
the ball, and with many of the team's key defen
sive players leaving school —lank Williams, (loy
Wire, and Marcus 1 loover, just to name a few —
Teevens definitely has his work cut out for him.
This just makes his selection of a defensive co
ordinator even more important, given Teevens'
lack of defensive expertise (as an assistant, he was
responsible for the offense in each of his four
stops). Let's just hope that he follows in Spurrier's
footsteps and hires a creative and aggressive de
fensive coordinator that can help mold the de
fense into a winner as well.
Looking at Teevens, lie's young, smart, com
mitted to all aspects of coaching and educating
student-athletes and has head coaching experi
ence, in addition to assistant coaching experience,
under one of the game's most respec ted minds,
112 le seems like he's got it all.
There's just that one issue that I have with his
hiring, and in noway is it Teevens' fault or should
it be a mark against him.
However, in Tyrone Willingham, Stanford
had one of the most prominent, successful,
African-American coaches in all of sports. And,
because of that, the school was making a state
ment as an institution, leading the way in what is
one of the biggest problems in the entire sports
world — the lac k of minorities in coaching and


Mac Levine
front office positions.
As Coach Willingham departed
for Notre Dame, Stanford was
forced to look fora new coach, not
by its own accord. But, in the wake
of his leaving, the school was also
given another opportunity to make
a statement by hiring another high
ly qualified minority candidate ig
nored by other egregious institu
tions. It was an opportunity missed.
One can say that race should
play no part in the hiring of coach
es and, in a perfect world, it
wouldn't. But our world is far from
perfect, and so the onus may be on
responsible, enlightened, institu
tions like Stanford to be a leader

and a beacon for change.
Now this is neither a knock on
Buddy Teevens as a coach, nor on
Ted Leland as an athletic director,
but it is still something that should
not go without recognition.
As a Stanford football lan, I am
ready and excited for . Coach
Teevens and the integrity and loot
ball expertise that he brings to the
sideline. He is a good selection and
should be a successful head football
coach here for years to come.
All I'm saying is that loot ball and
sports as a whole exist within a
greater society, and that bigger pic -
ture must not be ignored, especial
ly by a place like Stanford.

Mac, a sophomore, wants Jo find out
where he can pick up one of those sweet
Stanford ties Buddy was wearing yes
terdax. That's some flava.

tions like Stanford to be a leader

and a beacon for change.
Now this is neither a knock on
Buddy Teevens as a coach, nor on
Ted Leland as an athletic director,
but it is still something that should
not go without recognition.
As a Stanford football lan, I am
ready and excited for . Coach
Teevens and the integrity and loot
ball expertise that he brings to the
sideline. He is a good selection and
should be a successful head football
coach here for years to come.
All I'm saying is that loot ball and
sports as a whole exist within a
greater society, and that bigger pic -
ture must not be ignored, especial
ly by a place like Stanford.

Mac, a sophomore, wants Jo find out
where he can pick up one of those sweet
Stanford ties Buddy was wearing yes
terdax. That's some flava.
The name Buddy Teevens probably
won't ring a bell in the head of even the
most knowledgeable college football
fan, but that doesn't mean he's not a
good choice to replace Tyrone Willingham as
head football coach. All in all, he is.
Stanford is not an easy place to coach or recruit
because of the institution's obvious academic
rigor, and T eevens seems ready and able to meet
the challenge. Having both quarterbacked and

coached Dartmouth to Ivy
League titles, T eevens is a man
suited to deal with the dual na
ture of the successful student
athlete found at Stanford.
As Leland put it at today's
press conference, Teevens is an
"educator, who happens to be a
coach," and not the other way
around — a vital characteristic

for any coach that wishes to continue Coach Will
ingham's legacy of molding his players into posi
tive, well-rounded, student-athletes.
To be frank there aren't many coaches across
the country that could lit the hill. Would Mike
Riley or Norv Turner (other names thrown
around as potential candidates) care as much
about all of the off-the-field components that
being a head coach at Stanford entails?
Also, you could get the sense today from hear
ing Teevens speak that he views his new oppor
tunity as the culmination ofa 23-year coaching ca
reer, and not as a stepping stone to either the
NFL or a more prominent, successful college pro
gram. Only 45 years old, Teevens conveyed the
feeling that he has coached at seven different
schools precisely to get I he chance as a head coach
at a school like Stanford, and he plans to establish
himself here for years to come.
Every coach would say the same type of thing
at his introductory press conference, but as naive
as this may sound, I believed him. In my view,
Teevens is poised to be here a real long time, as
long as the team gets it done on the field.
And on the field, the wide-open passing of
fense that Spurrier has passed on to Teevens in a
fanatical, quasi-religious way should be a perfect
fit for the Cardinal, given the make-up of both the
team and the Pac-10.
With Chris Lewis back at quarterback next sea
son. Teevens should have no problem coming up
with imaginative ways of getting Teyo Johnson,
Luke Powell and even Kerry Carter the ball out of
his multiple-receiver sets.
Needless to say, fans can get ready fora
high-flying aerial attack that, if it resembles
anything that Spurrier would come up with,
should be lighting up the scoreboard constant
ly next season.
I lowever, the game is played on both sides of
the ball, and with many of the team's key defen
sive players leaving school —lank Williams, (loy
Wire, and Marcus 1 loover, just to name a few —
Teevens definitely has his work cut out for him.
This just makes his selection of a defensive co
ordinator even more important, given Teevens'
lack of defensive expertise (as an assistant, he was
responsible for the offense in each of his four
stops). Let's just hope that he follows in Spurrier's
footsteps and hires a creative and aggressive de
fensive coordinator that can help mold the de
fense into a winner as well.
Looking at Teevens, lie's young, smart, com
mitted to all aspects of coaching and educating
student-athletes and has head coaching experi
ence, in addition to assistant coaching experience,
under one of the game's most respec ted minds,
112 le seems like he's got it all.
There's just that one issue that I have with his
hiring, and in noway is it Teevens' fault or should
it be a mark against him.
However, in Tyrone Willingham, Stanford
had one of the most prominent, successful,
African-American coaches in all of sports. And,
because of that, the school was making a state
ment as an institution, leading the way in what is
one of the biggest problems in the entire sports
world — the lac k of minorities in coaching and


Mac Levine
front office positions.
As Coach Willingham departed
for Notre Dame, Stanford was
forced to look fora new coach, not
by its own accord. But, in the wake
of his leaving, the school was also
given another opportunity to make
a statement by hiring another high
ly qualified minority candidate ig
nored by other egregious institu
tions. It was an opportunity missed.
One can say that race should
play no part in the hiring of coach
es and, in a perfect world, it
wouldn't. But our world is far from
perfect, and so the onus may be on
responsible, enlightened, institu
tions like Stanford to be a leader

and a beacon for change.
