### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
It imitation is the highest lorm of flat
tery, then new Stanford head looiball
coach Buddy leevens will he buttering
up Steve Spurrier quite a bit in his time
on the Farm.
fee veils spent the last three years
studying under Spurrier at Florida, and
at yesterday's introdiu tory press confer
ence he seemingly passed his exam, re
counting the many lessons he learned
from the C )ld Ballcoach.
"From an offensive standpoint, we
would like to be wide-open throwing
outfit. Certainly my background with
Steve Spurrier is conducive to that,"
Teevens said. "Working with coach
Spurrier has been a thrill. I le has been
one of the most rewarding individuals to
work with, work under and get to know.
I lis creativity and innovativenessdid not
go on deaf ears."
Fgged on by reporters to ch aw com
parisons to his mentor, Teevens remi
nisced on a time in the Orange liowl
when the Gators fated a long third
down. Spurrier called a play and
Teevens scrambled to find it in his
charts. When his search was unsuccess
ful, lie was simply told alter a 25-yard
completion â€” "that's because coach just
made that play."
Not surprisingly, mention of
Teeven's intended pass-happ) scheme
puts a sparkle in junior quarterback
Chris Lewis' eyes.
"I le started talking about the oflense
and how it would have a lot of passing,

and we were best friends tight away,"
said 1 .ewis, who was part of at hree-mem
ber player panel that joined the coaching
interview process.
Don't tell talented senior backfield
mates Kerry Carter and Casey Moore,
but Teevens failed to utter a word about
any sort of rushing game, even though
the Cardinal topped the Pacific 10 Con
ference this season on the ground. Still,
don't expect the new Cardinal leader to
tip the scales of departed coach Tyrone
Willingham's balanced offense too
much. T eevens repeatedly acknowl
edged the effectiveness of Willingham's
2001 squad, which finished at 9-3 and
No. 16 in the polls.
"T his isn't a rebuilding process or a
majt >r change," lie said. "It'sa progression."
Athletic director led Leland sat be
side leevens through the conference,
and admitted that with the Cardinal's
success under Willingham conies a
heavy dose of added expectations. As
Stanford sports such as swimming, ten
nis and even basketball have consistently
drawn lop recruits and challenged an
nually for national championships, foot
ball has excused itself under the guise
that an institution with such rigid acade
mic standards cannot possess a college
football powerhouse.
Leland thinks it's time for that to
change, and having known Teevens
since he hired the young coach to lead
Dartmouth in 1987, he believes Teevens
can c arry the Cardinal to the heights of
college football.
"We're in the position to tell [recruits]
that 'if you come to Stanford you'll eet

the opportunity to get a world c lass edu
cation and a chance to make a run at the
national championship,"' Leland said.
While Willingham's former boss is
quick to give him credit, he believes that
Teevens adds two things to the Stanford
football equation: increased aggressive
ness both on the football field and the re
cruiting circuits, and Lewis optimistical
ly agrees.
"[Willingham's staff] were really
great coaches but a little more reserved
than coach Teevens," Lewis said. "T he

guys now are a little more athletic than
guys in the past. We want to fly around
and this has kind of taken the ball and
chain off."
I eevens' agenda also calls for more
aggressiveness on the defensive side of
the ball. Stanford finished tied for last in
sacks in the Pac-10 in 2001, and Teevens
plans to attack the opposing quarterback
with the same fervor that the offense will
attack the end zone.
