### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While Stanford's new women's gymnas
tics head coach Kristen Smyth faces her first
test of the 2002 season this Saturday against
No. 15 Minnesota, she does have a corps of
battle-tested veterans returning from last
year's eighth-place and school-best finish at
the NCAA Championships to rely on.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
Saturday: No. 8 Stanford at No. 15
Minnesota, 5 p.m., Minneapolis, Minn.

Formerly (lie Associate Head Coach at
Arizona State, Smyth replaced coaches Mark
and Rene Cook, who left to start a new pro
gram at the University of Arkansas. During
the Cooks' four seasons at Stanford, the (Car
dinal won two Pacific 10 Conference titles
and competed at the NCAA championships
twice, ending last season with a solid 12-'$
record. They also coached Larissa Fontaine,
Stanford's first and only National (Champi
on, during their tenure.
In addition to the loss of its successful
coaching duo, the No. 8 Cardinal lost two
time All American Jen Kxaltacion to gradua
tion. However, the return of sophomore
Kendall Beck and junior Abby Cair from in
jury and the addition of "outstanding" fresh
men Mandy Delgadoand Maria Ranieri will
add some more depth to the rotation.
"This team has so much depth," said
Smyth. "That's the beauty of'the team. I here's
not one or two real standout athletes."
Leading the team this year will be senior
captains Kristen Jensen and Katy Herbert,
both former Ail-Americans, as well as fellow
senior Becky Meldrum. Junior Alissa Coop
er has been struggling with an injury, but is
steadily getting stronger, while junior Kelsey

Stillinger looks to figure in on the vault.
The decorated freshmen of last year
may be the difference against powerhous
es such as UCLA. Sophomore Lindsay
Wing, first-team All American on beam
and Ail-Around, looks to figure promi
nently in the bars, floor, and beam this
year. Ihe Pac-10 Freshman of the Year,
Wing finished second on the beam last year
at the NCAAs. Sophomore Lise Leveille, a
first team AJI-American selection on Moor
and a 2000 Olympian, will be one of the
leaders on the floor and beam.
Sophomore Caroline Fluhrer has been
looking "absolutely amazing" in practice, ac
cording to Smyth, and figures as one of top
competitors in floor, bars and vault, while
Shelly (ioldberg should Ik- a strong competi
tor on tht- floor and vault.
With Smyth at the helm, Stanford fans
can expect flashier dismounts, more "fun
routines," as we ll as a back-to-basics mental
ity based 011 a more rigorous conditioning
program, she said.
Saturday's meet pits the Cardinal against
a gritty Golden Gophers team. Last year, the
Gophers missed Nationals by a mere .015 to
none other than Stanford. I he Gophers w ill
be looking for their second victory of the sea
son, as well as revenge for last year's loss to
Stanford, in which the Cardinal set school
records for beam and overall score and took
first place in each of the four events.
Having lost only two letter winners from
last year, Minnesota boasts a solid roster.
I .eading the charge will be senior Mary Anne
Kelley, who broke the Gopher's all-around
record the last time she faced Stanford.
I he Cardinal has no room for error in its
early season, as nine of the 12 teams it will
face are ranked in the preseason top 25. Five
other teams in the l'ac-10 alone are ranked,
including defending National Champion
and top-ranked LCIA
"This is a team of incredible women.
I hey are self motivated and hard working
and enjoy each other's company . . . If we hit
our routines we should Ik* able to compete
[well]," Smyth said.
