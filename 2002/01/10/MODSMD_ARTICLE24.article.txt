This Friday kicks off a busy stretch of

compete in eight dual meets by the end

wrestling powers as Oregon State and
Fresno State.

and Stanford vs. Southern Oregon,
Davis, Calif.
Sunday: Stanford vs. TBA, 9 a.m.,

Lions' sweep < rame nearly one month after
their previous meet, as this weekends
competition also marks the beginning of
the heavy part of their schedule.
Columbia also competed at the (llill
Keen Vegas Invitational in December
but did not face any Stanford wrestlers.
One of the most compelling matchups
of the Columbia meet will be Cardinal red

shirt freshman Matt Gentry squaring off
against I.ions sophomore Krik Norgaard
at 149 pounds.
Amateur Wrestling News honored
Norgaard, a 22-match winner a year
ago and 12-3 this season, as the third
best freshman wrestler in the country at
I 10 pounds.
Meanwhile, Gentry will be looking to
continue his recent success after going 3-0
al the lone Star Duals on Jan. 5.
"Even though Matt is in our lineup for
the first time this year, he has definitely
proven that he can wrestle and compete
against anyone at the Division I level," said
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie. "Matt
expects to win every time he goes out, and

I'm convinced that he can."
"It's exciting when one of our better
guys is going against one of their better
guys. I definitely think Matt will be up for
that challenge," Buddie said.
Gentry said he doesn't c hange his style
of wrestling depending on the competi
tion, and that this week is no exception.
"This year has been awesome and a lot
of fun," Gentry said. "We've been working
hard and it's finally paying off. Succ ess is
one of the best parts about competing."
Stanford's second dual meet of the
day is against Southern Oregon. Ihe
Raiders (2-0) are the reigning NAIA
champions and have posted 31 consecu
tive winning seasons.

Buddie said that Southern Oregon
might prove to be an even tougher oppo
nent than Columbia.
On Saturday, Stanford will compete
in the sixth-annual Aggie Open along
with Fresno State, Columbia, Cal State-
Fullerton, Southern Oregon, Boise
State, Cal Poly-San Louis Obispo and
Kmbry-Riddle.
After this weekend, Stanford begins
preparation fora dual meet against Cal
State-Bakersfield on Jan. I Mat Burnham
Pavilion. The meet will lx- Stanford's first
at home since Nov. 10.
"|A busy schedule is] where the real sci-
erne of coaching wrestling comes
in," Buddie said. "This is the part
of the season where we need to
wrestle more than teach. We need
to increase conditioning and
toughness now and, at the same
time, minimize injuries."
Avoiding the injury bug is par
ticularly important now, as sopho

more Nathan Peterson (12;>
pounds) will likely bt' out for be
tween two and four weeks after he
fractured his finger at the Lone
Star Duals.
"We're lucky in that we have an
experienced fourth-year wrestler,
Mike Copperman, who is very ca
pable of filling Nathan's shoes and
is excited to get his chance in the
lineup," Buddie said. "We're a lit
tle beaten up right now, but we're
going into the weekend expecting
to win."
