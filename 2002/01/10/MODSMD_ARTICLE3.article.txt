New football coach Buddy Teevens spoke about his plans for the Stanford football program at yes
terday's press conference.
According to Leland, what they
found was a coach who could suc -
cessfully follow Willingham's
weighty legacy.
"We just lost a man to Notre
Dame who had a great personal
affinity and charisma with young
athletes," Leland said, while to his
sick* Teevens winked warmly at a
friend in attendance. "Of all the
coaches I've worked with,
[Teevens] most resembles [Will
ingham]."
I eevens reiterated his desire to
continue "the progression" begun
by Willingham and to win a Pacific
10 Conference Championship

next season, But he made it clear
that lit- would coach with his own
style, one heavily influenced by
former Florida head coach Steve
Spurrier, leevens' boss for the
past three years.
"Working with coat li Spurrier
has been a thrill, said leevens,
who woi ked ;is the (iators' assis
tant offensive coordinator the
past two seasons, "lie has been
one of the most rewarding indi
viduals to woi k wit li. work under
and gel to know. Mis creativity
and innovativeness did not goon
deaf ears."
I .eland, (|iii< k to countei (lit i
(ism that leevens was hired large
l\ because of his relationship willi
the Stanford athletic director, said
"I've had | I eevens| in the bat k of
my mind, but we li.id a fair and

open process.
And, compared with the other
two candidates under serious
consideration, leevens' hiring
makes sense.
I lis success as both a player and
coat li at I)artmouth proves he can
excel .it an academically rigorous
institution. Similarly, his years
under Spurrier at Florida, a
perennial contender for the Na
tional Championship, shows an
ability to coach and recruit the
most talented players in the coun
try. At a school like Stanford, such
a combination is vital.
While leevens tacitly ac
knov\ letlged si niggling during a
10-45 live-year run at I ulane —
"1 wouldn't recommend the fir
ing process to anyone" — he
said that the process made him a

belter coach.
Working under Ron Turner
at Illinois and at Florida with
Spurrier afforded him the op
portunity "to step back and com
pare how [he's] been doing
things and how [he] would do
them differently if given the
chance again," he said.
Feevens will have the opportu
nity to put those lessons to work
immediately. Recruits arrive on
campus this weekend and he said
he'd like to finalize his stall "in the
next couple of days to a week."
"My wife just asked me, 'when
will we see you again?'," l eevens
said. With a wide grin on his face,
leevens shrugged in mock re
sponse, fully recognizing the
mountain of work that lies before
him.

New football coach Buddy Teevens spoke about his plans for the Stanford football program at yes
terday's press conference.
According to Leland, what they
found was a coach who could suc -
cessfully follow Willingham's
weighty legacy.
"We just lost a man to Notre
Dame who had a great personal
affinity and charisma with young
athletes," Leland said, while to his
sick* Teevens winked warmly at a
friend in attendance. "Of all the
coaches I've worked with,
[Teevens] most resembles [Will
ingham]."
I eevens reiterated his desire to
continue "the progression" begun
by Willingham and to win a Pacific
10 Conference Championship

next season, But he made it clear
that lit- would coach with his own
style, one heavily influenced by
former Florida head coach Steve
Spurrier, leevens' boss for the
past three years.
"Working with coat li Spurrier
has been a thrill, said leevens,
who woi ked ;is the (iators' assis
tant offensive coordinator the
past two seasons, "lie has been
one of the most rewarding indi
viduals to woi k wit li. work under
and gel to know. Mis creativity
and innovativeness did not goon
deaf ears."
I .eland, (|iii< k to countei (lit i
(ism that leevens was hired large
l\ because of his relationship willi
the Stanford athletic director, said
"I've had | I eevens| in the bat k of
my mind, but we li.id a fair and

open process.
And, compared with the other
two candidates under serious
consideration, leevens' hiring
makes sense.
I lis success as both a player and
coat li at I)artmouth proves he can
excel .it an academically rigorous
institution. Similarly, his years
under Spurrier at Florida, a
perennial contender for the Na
tional Championship, shows an
ability to coach and recruit the
most talented players in the coun
try. At a school like Stanford, such
a combination is vital.
While leevens tacitly ac
knov\ letlged si niggling during a
10-45 live-year run at I ulane —
"1 wouldn't recommend the fir
ing process to anyone" — he
said that the process made him a

belter coach.
Working under Ron Turner
at Illinois and at Florida with
Spurrier afforded him the op
portunity "to step back and com
pare how [he's] been doing
things and how [he] would do
them differently if given the
chance again," he said.
Feevens will have the opportu
nity to put those lessons to work
immediately. Recruits arrive on
campus this weekend and he said
he'd like to finalize his stall "in the
next couple of days to a week."
"My wife just asked me, 'when
will we see you again?'," l eevens
said. With a wide grin on his face,
leevens shrugged in mock re
sponse, fully recognizing the
mountain of work that lies before
him.
Calling ii a "great clay for Stanford
athletics and Stanford football," athlet
ic director fed l.eland presented for
mer Florida assistant Budcl) leevens
as the Cardinal's new head football
coach during a press conference yes

head coach Mike- Rile) had been consid
ered the front-runner, following a week
long scan h involving numerous campus
constituencies, l.eland finall) settled on
his old friend from Dartmouth. Kugene
Francis Teevens 111.
"Of all the coaches I've ever hired, I
don't know if I've ever seen a better lit be
tween a person, his personal integrity
and professional capabilities and the val
ues and the needs of the institution as I
see here," said l.eland. who originally
hired Teevens to be the head coach of the
Big Creen in 1987.

Teevens, who wore a big smile and
talked excitedly throughout the event,
was oflered the job I uesday afternoon
after Provost John Ftchemendy ap
proved 1 eland's recommendation.
"We 're all ec static to be here," said the
15-year old I eevens, referring to his wife
kirsten and teenage children Lindsay
and Kugene.
"The qualities and opportunities
that Stanford presents, those are
things that I believe heart and soul —
I hat I rue si udent-athletes are individu
als that are going to well-educated and
who value success in the classroom but
also value success on the football field.
And success in both is not mutually
exclusive."
Details of tlu- contract were not dis
closed, but the compensation package is
thought to be near to that of former
coach Tyrone Willingham, estimated at
$75(),0()()-$80(),()()() per year.
"It's no moral statement,"' [but] Stan
ford isn't willing to pay its football coach

seven or eight times what the University
president is making, Leland said, dis
cussing the $2-$H million contracts
signed recently by several national pro
grams. "1 d«n't think you can buy a Na
tional (championship."
