# Teyo Johnson:
## Original Playa 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
Yes folks, he's back.
Well, technically, he never really
left.
Alter finishing off a breakout
season off the court, averaging 52
yards a game and scoring seven
touchdowns, including one in the
inaugural Seattle Bowl, Mr. I'acific
-10 Football Freshman of the Year
has returned to the hardwood floor
of Maples Pavilion.
1 le's a sophisticated sophomore
now, nose already wet, and thirsty
to regain the national exposure
that life on the Cardinal football
field has already afforded him.
So you faithful Sixth Man Club
members can for the time being
hold off on the "we want Teyo"
cheers until next season.
Your words will no longer be in
vain, 'leyo Johnson has heard your
call and is ready to recommit him
self to the Cardinal basketball team.
The 6-fbot-7, 240-pound quar
terback, turned unstoppable wide
receiver, now power forward/ca
pable perimeter player, has already
proved his versatility and athleti
cism on the football field.
Now Johnson is happy to accept
the challenge of competing with
collegiate basketball's best.
"Basketball is a welcome
change," he said. "The football sea
son is very longand grueling, so it's

nice to be doing something differ
ent.'*
But Teyo is more than just an
other big body out there. He's
worth more to this team than a few
extra offensive rebounds.
He's not just your average, run
of the mill, high school two-sport
.All-American scoring threat.
I bis season Johnson brings a
more intangible quality to this
Stanford squad.
"Teyo's got a contagious confi
dence, which is what this team real
ly needs right now," said senior
()latunde Sobomehin, a three-year
team manager and practice player.
"1 le's sure that he can do anything.
1 fe is confidence personified."
So, where does this confidence
stem from?
"It's just from growing up and
having to be confident," Johnson
said. "You have to have that atti
tude playing basketball against the
nation's best, and you have to have
that confidence on the football field
when you know the ball's coming to
you. 1 know that my mentality is
helpful to this team."
In his case, bench production is
about more than just being able to
enter a game and score. It's about
the leadership and heart he
brings to this sometimes-frantic
Stanford team.
Fact: out of the Cardinal's
three losses to date (Texas, Bring
ham Young and California), l eyo

has only been present for the loss
to Cal.
Many of liis teammates agree
that simply his presence—his com
petitive mentality and vocal nature
on the bench — fills a motivational
void on this Stanford squad.
"Teyo brings a lot of intensity to
the team," said freshman swing
man Josh Childress. "He brings
with him a lot of emotion and we've
really needed that at times."
Johnson estimates that he'll be
back in full basketball form "by the
end of January," just in time for the
first in a series of matches against
highly touted Pac-10 competitors
I ( lA, I JSC) and Arizona.
And, as always, he has high ex
pectations for himself in basketball
as well as football.
"I want to be a physical presence
inside, an outside shooter when
needed and I'll bring some speed
to the post position," Johnson said.
Not only does Teyo exude
self-confidence but he is also very
optimistic about this team and its
capabilities.
"1 think we're playing well right
now but more importantly I think
we are going to peak at the light
time," he said.
If that's true, and the Cardinal
can emerge from its recent dol
drums, then Teyo will have proven
his worth as a triple threat: a great
football player, a great basketball
player and a great prognosticate!'.

.All-American scoring threat.
I bis season Johnson brings a
more intangible quality to this
Stanford squad.
"Teyo's got a contagious confi
dence, which is what this team real
ly needs right now," said senior
()latunde Sobomehin, a three-year
team manager and practice player.
"1 le's sure that he can do anything.
1 fe is confidence personified."
So, where does this confidence
stem from?
"It's just from growing up and
having to be confident," Johnson
said. "You have to have that atti
tude playing basketball against the
nation's best, and you have to have
that confidence on the football field
when you know the ball's coming to
you. 1 know that my mentality is
helpful to this team."
In his case, bench production is
about more than just being able to
enter a game and score. It's about
the leadership and heart he
brings to this sometimes-frantic
Stanford team.
Fact: out of the Cardinal's
three losses to date (Texas, Bring
ham Young and California), l eyo

has only been present for the loss
to Cal.
Many of liis teammates agree
that simply his presence—his com
petitive mentality and vocal nature
on the bench — fills a motivational
void on this Stanford squad.
"Teyo brings a lot of intensity to
the team," said freshman swing
man Josh Childress. "He brings
with him a lot of emotion and we've
really needed that at times."
Johnson estimates that he'll be
back in full basketball form "by the
end of January," just in time for the
first in a series of matches against
highly touted Pac-10 competitors
I ( lA, I JSC) and Arizona.
And, as always, he has high ex
pectations for himself in basketball
as well as football.
"I want to be a physical presence
inside, an outside shooter when
needed and I'll bring some speed
to the post position," Johnson said.
Not only does Teyo exude
self-confidence but he is also very
optimistic about this team and its
capabilities.
"1 think we're playing well right
now but more importantly I think
we are going to peak at the light
time," he said.
If that's true, and the Cardinal
can emerge from its recent dol
drums, then Teyo will have proven
his worth as a triple threat: a great
football player, a great basketball
player and a great prognosticate!'.
