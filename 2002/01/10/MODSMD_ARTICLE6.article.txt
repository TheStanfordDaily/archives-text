# Awakuni takes on vice provost position
## Despite his short time on campus, Awakuni already feels at home 
### FELIX SU 
When (iene Awakuni officially
began his duties as the new Vice
Provost for Student Affairs last
week, he had already proven his
mettle: having met with a group of
protesting students in December,
his leadership and mediation skills
had been put to an immediate tesi.
Adeptly juggling an extremely
hectic schedule, Awakuni seems
to have quickly adjusted to his
new role, a post that Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman had temporarily
assumed since last spring, when
James Montoya departed to he
come vice president of the Col
lege Board.
Awakuni, a veteran specialist in
college student affairs, displayed
no apparent qualms about his
transition into the administrative
scene at Stanford.
"Frankly, I've been surprised
by how quickly I've become accli
mated to my new environment,"
Awakuni said when asked about
the adjustment to his new sur
roundings. "Although I have no
previous ties to Stanford, I feel

very much at home here.
Awakuni also voiced enthusi
asm about his post with a nod to
ward his predecessor, Montoya.
"As we all know, |im Montoya left
an impressive legacy at Stan
lord,'" he said. "I regard the op
portunity to follow his tenure as
both an exciting challenge and a
wonderful honor."
Awakuni is no stranger to the
(ioldcn State — since HISS, lie has
worked closely with students, fac

ulty and others at several college
campuses in California, both pub
lic and private. He attributed his
success and expertise in the field to
his consistence in listening closely
to all parties involved in any mat
ter, however conflicting their
needs may be.
"I have learned the importance
of establishing strong, trusting, on
going relationships with students,"
Awakuni said. "Starting with a
foundation of trust, there is a

much greater likelihood that hon
est, respectful discussions can
occur regarding difficult issues."
Awakuni's words were seem
ingly reflective of his firsthand ex
perience with Stanford student
protests last month — before he
had even officially begun his du
ties, he was thrust into the role of
administrative mediator in the on
going dispute between student
groups and Stanford Hospital offi
cials over the subcontracting of
janitorial jobs.
1 lis approach to handling the
heated affair did not waver
from his usual compromise-ori
ented mindset.
"As a student affairs profession
al. I'm accustomed to dealing with
issues that some might character
ize as 'tough,' " he said. "No matter
how emotional!) charged these sit
uations ma\ be, I like to focus on
the opportunity to help groups
work together to find points of
mutual interest."
Awakuni declined to identify
any particular goals or expec
tations for his role on campus
this year.
"Since 1 have only been at Stan
ford for a very short time, I plan to
do a thorough assessment of the
division before 1 artic ulate specific
goals for student affairs," he said.


KENDRICK KWOK/The Stanford Daily
Gene Awakuni, former vice president of student affairs at Columbia Univer
sity, has begun his first full quarter as new vice provost of student affairs for
Stanford University.
"Of course, future goals will in
clude a continuing commitment to
providing excellent service and
strong co-curricular programs
and initiatives."
Despite the vast array of other
institutions where Awakuni has
presided over student affairs, most
recently at Columbia University,
he was hesitant to liken any of his
former positions to his newfound
post at Stanford.

"Comparing institutions as dif
ferent as these [universities] is
Very difficult," he said. "There
are so many variables to consider.
Stanford and Columbia seem the
most similar, since both are high
ly selective, private institutions
with eminent faculty and out
standing students."
Awakuni did not cite any single
credential or experience from his
past work as being his most po
tentially valuable asset for his up
coming tasks. "I think it's impossi
ble to point out one skill or expe
rience and speculate that ii will be
most influential." he said. "In

stead, I imagine that my contribu
tions to student affairs at Stanford
will be shaped by the sum of my
past experiences."
Awakuni's foremost responsi
bility in his own eyes is meeting the
very people whose interests and
concerns fit* addresses.
"I'd like to get to know as many
students as possible and as soon as
possible," lie said. "In order to do
that I need some help, and so I en
courage students to meet with me
in my office [on the second floor of
I residder], invite me to vi*it their
residence halls or to have dinner
with them in their dining halls."
