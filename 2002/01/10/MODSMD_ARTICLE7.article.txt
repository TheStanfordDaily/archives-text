# Students adjust to recent Axess upgrades
## 
### SARAH PAPÃ‰ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many students arriving on campus
after the break, Axess hardly seemed like a fit
ling name for an information and registration
system that they could not get on to. Over the
weekend, changes were made to Axess that
prevented students with older VVeh browsers
from logging on to the site.
As part of the upgrade to the new Axess sys
tem. the Web site requires Web browsers such
as Internet Kxplorcr or Netscape to have 128-
bit security. Students or faculty running
browsers with security lower than 128-bits will
see an error message.

browsers, while Internet I xplorer users may
do the same at www .inicrosoft.com.
PIN numbers are 110 longer needed to log
in. This and other system changes now allow
more users to connect to Axess at the same
time.
Previously, before major registration
deadlines, students often encountered an
error message saving that too main students
were logged on.
Axess has a variety of new features, one of
which allows students and advisors to view an
unofficial transcript, but the biggest change

lor fatuity is the ability to enter grades direct
ly on to Axess instead of going through the
registrar.
Because of this change, students can now
\ iew their grades earlier. I his new feature also
eliminated the stacks of paperwork that the
Registrar's Office was lortnerly pressured to
complete quickly and accurately.
According to Ciabriel Olszewski, associate
registrar for enrollment services, the imple
mentation went exceedingly well.
"Most faculty took to the new process quick
ly . probably because of the wonderful training
efforts of the Axess 2000 Campus Readiness
leam and the system's simple design," he said.
Problems did occur, Olszewski
added, but most came from the
unfamiliarity of the system.
Most students and faculty are
adjusting well to the new system,
despite some of the glitches.
"I like Axess, it's easy to man
age a lot of stuff, provided it's ac

tually working . . . which recently
has not been very often," said
freshman Brooks Kincaid.
Still, some upperc lassmen who
are used to the old system and
some new students unused to the
quirks of Axess are having a hard
time adjusting.
"1 came from a school where
our Web site like Axess worked
flawlessly," said transfer student
Debbie Park. "Axess is unneces
sarily complicated, and the papei

version of the time schedule is eas
ier to use than the online version."
I lie next big change related to
Axess will be in spring quarter,
when students with financial aid
will have to pre-register for 12
units of classes. Previously, stu
dents had to file a commitment of
registration for the following year.
There were some concerns that
this would eliminate the shopping
period that makes Stanford so
unique. But University Registrar

Roger Printup said in an earlier
interview that students will still
have that option.
"The add / drop deadline will
not change," lie said. "You can
add and drop 100 times a day. We
don't care."
Olszewski said that if any more
large problems arise, a notice will
be posted on Ax ess. He added
that if students are having prob
lems, they should click on the
feedback link on the site's toolbar.
