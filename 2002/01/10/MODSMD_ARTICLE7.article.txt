# Students adjust to recent Axess upgrades

### SARAH PAPÃ‰ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many students arriving on campus
after the break, Axess hardly seemed like a fit
ling name for an information and registration
system that they could not get on to. Over the
weekend, changes were made to Axess that
prevented students with older VVeh browsers
from logging on to the site.
As part of the upgrade to the new Axess sys
tem. the Web site requires Web browsers such
as Internet Kxplorcr or Netscape to have 128-
bit security. Students or faculty running
browsers with security lower than 128-bits will
see an error message.
rhe Axess 2000 Project I earn sent out .1 no

tice saving that anyone who received this mes
sage needs to download a more secure Web
browser. Netscape users may go to www.Stan
ford.edu/group/itss/ess to upgrade their
browsers, while Internet I xplorer users may
do the same at www .inicrosoft.com.
PIN numbers are 110 longer needed to log
in. This and other system changes now allow
more users to connect to Axess at the same
time.
Previously, before major registration
deadlines, students often encountered an
error message saving that too main students
were logged on.
Axess has a variety of new features, one of
which allows students and advisors to view an
unofficial transcript, but the biggest change

lor fatuity is the ability to enter grades direct
ly on to Axess instead of going through the
registrar.
Because of this change, students can now
\ iew their grades earlier. I his new feature also
eliminated the stacks of paperwork that the
Registrar's Office was lortnerly pressured to
complete quickly and accurately.
According to Ciabriel Olszewski, associate
registrar for enrollment services, the imple
mentation went exceedingly well.
"Most faculty took to the new process quick
ly . probably because of the wonderful training
efforts of the Axess 2000 Campus Readiness
leam and the system's simple design," he said.
