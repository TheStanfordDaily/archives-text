are jointly sponsoring a quarter
long seminar series entitled "Out
on the Market."

I he nine-week series will fea
ture panels and speakers from
the University and several out
side organizations.
" I he idea was realK to provide
students with the opportunity to
(ope with the conflicts that ai ise ei
tliei explicith 01 implicitly from
their being professional people
and LCN I people, whether in the
closet or not," said Benjamin
Lawrance, the series organizer
and a doctoral student in history
" There's a very thin line be

tween the professional and private
life so that gta\ area is ven com
plicated for people who lac k .1 little
bit of personal confidence."
Ixiwrance. who has been active
in the student bod\ since IWbalso
said that "there's been 110 attempt
(before this| to provide a holistic,
overatehing graduate student sort
of program. I'm hoping that we're
going to reach out to a lot of new
grad students so that it's both new
and productive for them"
\lthough the program focusc>

on queer graduate students, it is
open to evervone.
" I Ins is ver\ much an issue
lor everybody. not |ust LGBT
students and fat uity," l.awrance
said. " I"ve had «i number of non
queer faculty be ven helpful
and informative.
I be important thing is that this
is for everybody. It's focusing on
LGIVI students, but anyone can
come to this he< ause there's going
to be a lot of stories and anecdotes
that come out of this meeting
that will help people deal with
relationships that are part and
parcel of being a graduate stu
dent at Stanford."
Kadi week, speakers and pan
elists will address one issue of
queer life for graduate students.
The series will attempt to ad
dress topics for students from each
of the graduate schools at Stanford.
Lawrance said he drew on an
extensive network to bring in
some of the guest speakers.
"We're using a lot of out alum
ni," he said. "We're also drawing
on tlie CDC . . . With the net
work set up by the LCBT-CRC,
we're connecting with Out and
Equal Workplace Advocates, an
organization based in the city
that provides support and advo
cacy to the ILCBI I community

in the workplace."
Lawrance also drew up the
order for the series, based upon is
sues in typical queei graduate stu
dent life.
"It has a logical beginning and
logical ending," Lawrance said. "I
tried to incorporate multiple end
ings — the different avenues tli.it
people go into."
Today's panel, "The relation
ship with your advisor / profes
sor," will feature a panel of facul
ty as well as a question-and-an
swer session.
Lawrance said (hat several peo
ple had already voic ed an interest
in the program.
"I've had a lot of inquiries from
alumni who want to participate,"
he said. "A number of faculty and
administrative people are being
very supportive. I'd be very happy
if we have a turnout that fills out
the center on the 2nd floor of the
Old Eiretruck I louse."
History Prof. Peter Stansky,
Education Prof. John Baugh,
Mechanical Engineering Prof.

Bernard Roth, Biology Prof.

ways welcome people's com
ments," he said.
