Bond analyst is gloomy on
outlook for colleges
Moody 's Investors Service has darkened its outlook
for higher education in the near future, reasoning that
the recession and fears over terrorism will hurt tuition
revenue, endowment performance, and private giving.
The bond-rating agency, the second-largest in high
er ccluc ation after Standard & Poor's, changed its out
look for private colleges from "positive" to "c autiously
stable." I lie outlook lot public universities and systems
was revised from "positive" to "stable."
Moody 's, in a report s< hedtiled to be released today,
s,i\ s that it expects to downgrade the bond ratings of
"some" private institutions in the next year. "Acollege's
bond rating affects the- interest payments that it would
pa\ to investors."
