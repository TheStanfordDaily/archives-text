# Liberal magazine prints first issue
## 
### KRISTIN SCHLEICHER 
Today marks the debut of a new liberal voice on
campus with the first issue of the "Stanford Progres
sive" magazine.
Nearly 5,000 copies of the left-leaning publica
tion are being distributed to all undergraduate resi
dences, as well as certain high-traffic locations on
campus.
The magazine, which is targeted at all members
of the Stanford community, addresses a number of
political issues.
"The Progressive' is intended to be a political di
alogue on both national and campus issues," said
Editorial-board President Josh Benson, a junior.
The war in Afghanistan figures prominently in
the first issue, which includes a student reaction poll
to the war, commentaries about anti-war personali
ties on campus and an interview with Robert Reich,
the Secretary of Labor under President Clinton.
"[The first issue] addresses the political apathy of
students on this campus and encourages them to
speak out," said editorial board member J ulien Ca
pers, a junior. "Whether or not people agree with
our politics, the Stanford Progressive is a venue for
them to do so. It encourages people to search with
in themselves for their stance on something they
may never have thought about before."
While the inaugural issue has a more global
focus, the five members of the editorial board
agreed that in the coming months they hope to ad
dress topics specific to the Stanford campus, among
them the push for living wages, student representa
tion on the Hoard of Trustees and land use and de

velopment issues.
"We are going to ask some hard questions about
student rights," Benson said.
The magazine will be published two or three
times per quarter.
"The Progressive" is the product of the work of
a group of Stanford undergraduates, many of
whom are members of the Stanford Democrats.
The magazine is now a registered student organi
zation and is currently applying for financial sup
port from the ASSU.
Benson, Capers and the other editorial board
members spent last spring quarter and the summer
focusing on paperwork, leadership and logistics.
Last quarter, board members recruited writers, and
staff members designed the layout.
"['The Progressive'] was conceived last spring
amid displeasure with the unchallenged reign of the
Stanford Review as the only viable political publica
tion on campus," Benson said. "Someone during
freshman year called Stanford 'the intellectual capi
tal of the west,' and it just struck us as absurd that
there wasn't a liberal magazine at this kind of place."
Layout designer, sophomore ('litis Kost ex
pressed high hopes that "the Progressive" address
es the lack of communication between the Universi
ty and the outside world.
"The Hoover Institution is just one phone call
away from the major newspapers of the U.S., [so)
why can't other campus divisions take on a more
vocal role?" Kost said. "I hope that 'the Progressive'
will provoke students from all academic disciplines
to think about how their future careers can effect
positive social change."
