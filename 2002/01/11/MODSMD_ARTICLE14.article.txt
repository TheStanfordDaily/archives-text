### KELLY GRIEGO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Former Yahoo! vice president,
general counsel and secretary
Jol in Place has rejoined the Stan
ford community: last month, he
was named executive director of
the Law School's Center for Inter
net and Society.
Under the initiative and direc
tion of Law Prof. Lawrence
Lessig, the Center was born a
year ago as an offshoot of the Law
School's Program in Law, Science
8c Technology.
The Center's Web site defines
the center as "a public interest
technology law and policy pro
gram" that unites people from
several disciplines and interests
to "examine how the synergy be
tween [new technologies and the
law ] can either promote or harm
free speech, privacy, public com
mons, diversity and scientific
inquiry."
Lessig, the Center's director,
expressed great approval for
Place's appointment and return

to the law school from which lie
graduated. Lessig stressed that
Place's unique experiences as a
leading trailbla/.er in Internet law
give him an edge in probing the
questions to whit li the Center de
votes itself.
In his new role, Place will use
his real-world experience with
Internet law to serve as an advis
er to the Center's clinical pro
jects, corresponding and collabo
rating with various visiting fel
lows and speakers.
As the one full-time lawyer em
ployed by the Center and its c lini
cal director, Jennifer Cranick has
worked c losely with Place.
"It is a pleasure working with
John," she said. "He is very
knowledgeable and effective.
He cares about the public inter
est issues that the [Center] stud
ies and he has real, valuable ex
perience in law, technology and
business."
It is Place's intention to develop
and promote the Center as a pri
mary resource for law and policy
makers directly responsible for the
drafting and implementation of
Internet law and regulation.
Additionally, Place hopes to in
teract with students, offering guid
ance to those whose interests are in
sync with Place's.

"It's my hope that hearing the
perspective of someone with my
set of experiences might be some
thing the students find useful,"
Place told the Stanford Report.
Raised in Palo Alto, Place grad
uated from the Law School in
1985. Before landing his senior
post at Yahoo!, he was the senior
corporate counsel at Adobe Sys
tems in San Jose.
In 1994, while at Adobe, Place
was assigned the task of grappling
with how law should be applied to
the Internet. Still in the Internet's
nascent years, he was among the
first to examine the relationship
that would transpire between the
Internet and law.
Place accepted a similar posi
tion with Yahoo! in 1997, where he
became the first in-house attorney
at the company. Under his man
agement, the company's legal de
partment swelled to 50 attorneys
from around the world.
Place presided over Yahool's
law-related issues, as well as both
international and domestic public
policy and Yahoo!'s relationship
with government.
During his tenure at Yahoo!,
" The Los Angeles Daily Journal"
listed Place as one of the 100 most
influential attorneys in California
m 1999 and 2000.'
