## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford not suited for proposed student centers 
### 
Published Since 1891

Currently, the ASSU is investigating
options for improving Tresidder
and / or building a new student
union. Almost every year, some
one with aspirations for ASSU office
promises something along the lines of a
new student union. Sometimes it's a pro
posed renovation of Tresidder, other times
it's dreams of a new facility with a uniquely
student-oriented design. While we appreci
ate the value of union-talk as ASSU cam
paign fodder, we would like the Stanford
community to consider its actual needs be
fore thrusting demands fora new union on
the University.
Generally, the sales pitch fora new union
involves a magical place where students sit
around on cozy couches, sipping free coffee
and stopping their casual conversation for
the occasional foosball match. Students are

supposed to imagine a fantasy facility
where they can go pretty much anytime to
have fun, make friends and enjoy the col
lege life.
Unfortunately, this conception of a new
student union is unrealistic because of the
very nature of Stanford. This is a residen
tial University with an enormous emphasis
on residential education. The need fora
place where students can lounge around,
make friends, have a sense of community is
supposed to be met in the dormitory. Mak
ing 90 freshman feel a sense of community
is a difficult task for any residence staff; it is
absurd to think that the 13,000 students of
Stanford University will more easily find
friends in the lounge-type setting of a stu
dent union.
Furthermore, the need for student life to
revolve around the dorm community is

mandated by the design of the campus it
self. The dorms are sprawled across the
University; in fact, almost no location fora
student union exists that would not be a
lengthy walk from some dorms. The subur
banization of Stanford makes it a fact of life
that most socialization will take place in and
around the dorms. The lounge-style unions
popular at many other schools just
wouldn't make sense at Stanford.
So if students do not need a place to hang
out, what do they need in a union?
Seeing as many students do not have
cars, what they need most in a union are
convenient services for which they would
otherwise have to leave campus. And, sur
prisingly, this is exactly the purpose Tresid
der serves now.
Of course, there is certainly room for im
provement in many of the Tresidder busi-

nesses, and there are new businesses we
would like to see on campus. A grocery
store with reasonable prices would be nice.
So would a pizza place that was open late at
night. On the other hand, some tenants
could probably be moved off campus with
out much loss.
Student space should be a priority for the
University, but it's important that the space be
worthwhile. With square footage and construc
tion restrictions abundant, we would rather see
space be used to improve housing options or to
give individual student groups their own space.
As for Tresidder, we appreciate the steps the
University has taken to improve the quality of
the tenants there, and we hope the trend for
considering student need will continue. And,
when ASSU election time rolls around, we
hope the candidates will find something else to
talk about.
