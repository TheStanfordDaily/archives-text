# TWO GUYS WHO ARE BETTER THAN YOU
## The 						lifespan of a Bad Idea 
### 
Ladies and gentle
men, how many
times can you
honestly ask
someone how their break
was? Just curious.
Anyway, in this first
week back, you may be
feeling unusually ambi
tious. And why not? Why

not take the most challenging courses pos
sible, shopping around multiple classes to
find the best lit for you? Why not vow to
spend at least an hour every day doing
work? The short answer is: why don't you
just stop it. Using your past personal ex
perience as a guide, there's nothing to sug
gest that the beginning of a new quarter is
going to change 10 years of AIM, (.oogle
image-searching for the Olsen twins or
your characteristic apathy and discontent.
So drop those two classes you've been con
sidering or, better yet, save the time and
give up on work now.
Cool, now that we've eliminated our
academic competition lor this quarter,
let's move on.
By nearly unanimous agreement,
Arby's is the absolute worst fast-food
restaurant in America. Its signature roast
beef sandwiches lack even the most basic
scrumptiousness found in the sandwiches
of its competitors. In fact, the only re
deeming feature of this national chain —
often heralded by Arby's apologists—is
their signature condiment: "Doug and
Ramit, haven't you tried their horseradish
sauce?" Ladies and gentlemen, peers, pro
fessors, fat people: let us be honest. Re
gardless of how good their horseradish
sauce is, nothing can save Arby's from the
miserable reputation that it has itself gar
nered. In fact, while most of our existence
is characterized by the most trivial, mind
less drivel, we found this matter beneath
even our attention.
But we are students and we're here to
learn, or something like that, so we used
Arby's as a case study fora larger principle
— that is, how do Bad Ideas persist? Our
research is composed of thousands of first
hand interviews, two complete metastud
ies and seven visits abroad."
Charles Darwin's idea of natural selec
tion should, in theory, work for the nega
tive as well as the positive: Bad Ideas
should be extinguished by their own fail
ures. However, our research has uncov
ered a flaw in this assumption, whereby
Bad Ideas inexplicably persist.
We have two theories, 112 irst, the people
who recognize the Badness of an idea
don't take a stand and say, "that's stupid."
Think of the new Time Schedule, the new
Axess or the Jump-1 o-Conc lusions Mat.
Speakingof girlfriends,our RAJustin Wil
son recently reacquired his girlfriend
from the grips of the filthy Italy overseas
program. He used to visit our room at
least 10 times a day to play Mario Kart,
sometimes bv himself. But ever since she

got back, we haven't seen
him around much. One
might think that he's
catching up on lost time
with his girlfriend, hut
probably a more likely
explanation is that he
doesn't want her to know
that we are — err, were
— his friends, because

lie's ashamed of us. ( This is arguably un
derstandable.) In fact, sometimes he
knocks us over when he walks past us.
What's up, Justin? We thought it was al
ways bros before hos, beeotch.
Anyway, our second theory about Bad
Ideas revolves, not surprisingly, around
very dumb people. The link between Bad
Ideas and dumb people is clear, so we will
not waste time explaining it. Also, we're
getting tired of writing this goddamn col
umn. As an example, observe this IVI chat
that recently took place between Ramit
and his friend:
Vijay: also, i was thinking about it the
other day
Vijay: not as a joke, logic ally speaking,
people should need licenses to breed
Ramit: REALLY
Vijay: i was in orangvale yesterday and i
believe i saw a rat/human
Vijay: his parents should hav NKVER
beeen able to have a child
"But," you might gasp, if you are stupid,
"Doug and Ramit, are you suggesting that
America institute a policy of not allowing its
citizens their fundamental rights to procre
ate based on a social, economic or aesthet
ic basis?" The answer is that we would
never make such a specific statement, be
cause we can only get away with saying
something much, much more innocuous
and potentially defensible. A simple solu
tion occurred to us after consideration of
cross-cultural principles. We asked our
selves: "What right do we have to try to
change dumb people and condemn what
they do? Who are we, really, to cast judg
ments.-'" ()ur column name aside, it's real
ly just easier to point and laugh at someone
rather than devise a solution for behavioral
change. So laugh on, folks. Laugh on.
Stanford University, typically an island
of reasonableness in an irrational world, is
not always the exception to the Bad Idea
fallacy. For Bio majors, who have classes at
8:00 a.m., their everyday lives are mis
eries, the wretchedness of which even we
cannot fathom. Aside from the obvious
Asian parents forc ing their children to be
a doctor or be disowned from the family,
the ignominy of having to wake up at the
break ol dawn to go to the Mudd Chem
istry Building is a preposterously Bad
Idea that has persevered for years. It's like
asking a prisoner to wake lip early for his
own execution, every day. The only expla

Romit Sethi
nation for the persistence of this Had Idea
must be pinned on the weakness of every
Bio major. Seriously, why does it take
them all two full quarters to realize they're
not going to be doctors?
However, during our research, we
also uncovered evidence of Good Ideas
that, quite correctly, persist as they
should. Consider a dramatic success in
American marketing: Old Navy and its
use of very, very hot model Molly Sims
pitching this season's hottest gear: micro
mini-skirts. Recognize the results of this
Good Idea, whose positive results are

numerous: the female customers will
embrace the most fashionable attire of
the season, making them have higher
self-esteem. Old Navy will certainly be
happier with the viral market created by
their retail sales. And men will look at
these women with a yearning that we feel
everyday.
Somehow, it just doesn't seem like ana
lyzing skirt patterns is going to get us our
desired end result. Hmm... maybe this
was a Bad Idea.

1. This is patently false

Justin, aren't you glad we didn't write about that
mark on your neck? E-mail u.s at rarnUQvstan
jord.edu and judge, by the swiftness of our re
sponse, if we are lying about being in our chairs
23 hours a day.

Stanford University, typically an island

nation for the persistence of this Had Idea
must be pinned on the weakness of every
Bio major. Seriously, why does it take
them all two full quarters to realize they're
not going to be doctors?
However, during our research, we
also uncovered evidence of Good Ideas
that, quite correctly, persist as they
should. Consider a dramatic success in
American marketing: Old Navy and its
use of very, very hot model Molly Sims
pitching this season's hottest gear: micro
mini-skirts. Recognize the results of this
Good Idea, whose positive results are

numerous: the female customers will
embrace the most fashionable attire of
the season, making them have higher
self-esteem. Old Navy will certainly be
happier with the viral market created by
their retail sales. And men will look at
these women with a yearning that we feel
everyday.
Somehow, it just doesn't seem like ana
lyzing skirt patterns is going to get us our
desired end result. Hmm... maybe this
was a Bad Idea.

1. This is patently false

Justin, aren't you glad we didn't write about that
mark on your neck? E-mail u.s at rarnUQvstan
jord.edu and judge, by the swiftness of our re
sponse, if we are lying about being in our chairs
23 hours a day.
Ladies and gentle
men, how many
times can you
honestly ask
someone how their break
was? Just curious.
Anyway, in this first
week back, you may be
feeling unusually ambi
tious. And why not? Why

not take the most challenging courses pos
sible, shopping around multiple classes to
find the best lit for you? Why not vow to
spend at least an hour every day doing
work? The short answer is: why don't you
just stop it. Using your past personal ex
perience as a guide, there's nothing to sug
gest that the beginning of a new quarter is
going to change 10 years of AIM, (.oogle
image-searching for the Olsen twins or
your characteristic apathy and discontent.
So drop those two classes you've been con
sidering or, better yet, save the time and
give up on work now.
Cool, now that we've eliminated our
academic competition lor this quarter,
let's move on.
By nearly unanimous agreement,
Arby's is the absolute worst fast-food
restaurant in America. Its signature roast
beef sandwiches lack even the most basic
scrumptiousness found in the sandwiches
of its competitors. In fact, the only re
deeming feature of this national chain —
often heralded by Arby's apologists—is
their signature condiment: "Doug and
Ramit, haven't you tried their horseradish
sauce?" Ladies and gentlemen, peers, pro
fessors, fat people: let us be honest. Re
gardless of how good their horseradish
sauce is, nothing can save Arby's from the
miserable reputation that it has itself gar
nered. In fact, while most of our existence
is characterized by the most trivial, mind
less drivel, we found this matter beneath
even our attention.
But we are students and we're here to
learn, or something like that, so we used
Arby's as a case study fora larger principle
— that is, how do Bad Ideas persist? Our
research is composed of thousands of first
hand interviews, two complete metastud
ies and seven visits abroad."
Charles Darwin's idea of natural selec
tion should, in theory, work for the nega
tive as well as the positive: Bad Ideas
should be extinguished by their own fail
ures. However, our research has uncov
ered a flaw in this assumption, whereby
Bad Ideas inexplicably persist.
We have two theories, 112 irst, the people
who recognize the Badness of an idea
don't take a stand and say, "that's stupid."
Think of the new Time Schedule, the new
Axess or the Jump-1 o-Conc lusions Mat.
Speakingof girlfriends,our RAJustin Wil
son recently reacquired his girlfriend
from the grips of the filthy Italy overseas
program. He used to visit our room at
least 10 times a day to play Mario Kart,
sometimes bv himself. But ever since she

got back, we haven't seen
him around much. One
might think that he's
catching up on lost time
with his girlfriend, hut
probably a more likely
explanation is that he
doesn't want her to know
that we are — err, were
— his friends, because

lie's ashamed of us. ( This is arguably un
derstandable.) In fact, sometimes he
knocks us over when he walks past us.
What's up, Justin? We thought it was al
ways bros before hos, beeotch.
Anyway, our second theory about Bad
Ideas revolves, not surprisingly, around
very dumb people. The link between Bad
Ideas and dumb people is clear, so we will
not waste time explaining it. Also, we're
getting tired of writing this goddamn col
umn. As an example, observe this IVI chat
that recently took place between Ramit
and his friend:
Vijay: also, i was thinking about it the
other day
Vijay: not as a joke, logic ally speaking,
people should need licenses to breed
Ramit: REALLY
Vijay: i was in orangvale yesterday and i
believe i saw a rat/human
Vijay: his parents should hav NKVER
beeen able to have a child
