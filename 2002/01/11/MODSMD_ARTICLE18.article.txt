Response to Shapiro letter
In Harris Shapiro's letter in the Jan. 10
edition of the Daily, heart uses Answers in
(ienesis Ministries (Ai(J) ofa religious bias.
I le is absolutely correct. I lowever, he ne
glects to acknowledge that all scientists
have a bias which determines the assump
tions they bring to their scientific investi
gation and the manner in which they in
terpret their data. I le calls "dubious" the
organization's theory that the earth has a
relatively young age, but he makes that
claim without addresses the scientific evi
dence that AiCi uses to support its theory.
In fact, this is the typical response of the
evolutionist establishment towards cre
ation science. Rather than acknowledge
the substantial problems that authentic
science poses for the theory that humans
evolved from molecules, evolutionists
write off creationists as "religious extrem
ists" and "unscientific," while never con
vincingly responding to their scientific ev
idence. In contrast to atheistic worldview
that allows for supernatural activity in our
world, many evolutionists have a material
istic worldview which posits that only mat
ter exists and nothing in our world occurs
without a natural cause. Since the origin of
our world is an experiment that cannot be
repeated, it takes just as much faith to be
lieve in evolution as to believe in creation.
Regardless, neither worldview
should disqualify a person from practic
ing real science, not should it be held
against them — only the merits of their
data and their interpretation of that
data should be considered.
In the '70s and '80s, creationists and
evolutionists often debated on college

campuses about the science behind their
respective theories of origins. Since many
creationist presentations were quite com
pelling to those audiences, most evolu
tionists have dec lined further opportunity
to debate the issue, though creationists are
still willing.
This refusal usually occurs in the form
of defensive accusations that creationists
"invent myths" or "manipulate words to
deceive the crowds," but again this does
not address the merit of creationists'scien
tifically reasonable claims. It would be
good if those debates were revived on col
lege campuses, including Stanford, so th;it
students would get to hear evidence on
both sides from"the horse's mouth" as op
posed to a single professor who accuses
one side of bias but does not admit the
ways he- is also biased.
Finally, Aid considers the Bible as an
authority on issues of science and history
because they believe that the Bible is in
spired by an all-knowing (iod and because
its predictions about science and history
have been reliable, whereas the science we
practice is dependent on interpretation of
data by fallible humans.
With regard to the appendix, it was an
evolutionary bias that instructed scientists
to believe that the appendix was only a ves
tige of our supposed evolutionary prede
cessors, while it was the creationist belief in
an thoughtful Designer that coincided
with the scientific evidence that the ap
pendix has a valuable function.
Conversely, it was the evolutionary
presupposition that there must be "miss
ing links" between apes and humans that
motivated scientists for over 30 years to
waste their doctorate research on Pilt

clown Man, a fraudulent fossil that was fi
nally exposed as a hoax in the 19505. A cre
ationist examining the fossil would have
had a more open mind, because he did not
share the same bias. Science is reliable but
not perfect, therefore AiG believes that we
should esteem God's Word above man's
"best educated guess."
The volume of scientific evidence col
lected in the last 150 years has meant that
it now requires even more faith to believe
in the Darwinian theory of origins than it
did when Darwin first proposed his ideas.
For an evolutionary bias on the issue of
origins, visit Talk.Origins. Visit An
swerslnCienesis.org too fora creationist
bias, and look to see the integrity of its sci
ence. Any time you read a work of science,
be sure to identify the assumptions and
presuppositions the author uses in the
analysis. I hen you will be able to have the
most open mind and discern truth from
wishful thinking.

Accutane-suicide speculation
'presumptuous'
Current speculation (abcnews.com,
news24.com) that Accutane may Ik- be
hind Charles Bishop's decision to sponta
neously crash into an office building in
Tampa, Ma. this week is both presumptu
ous and not inconsequential.
Accutane (Isotretinoin) has been in the
spotlight recently for its possible relation
ship to depression, one that is still scientif
ically inconclusive according to the distrib
utor (Hoffman-La Roche), and one that is
administered to over 500,000 people a

year but according to a memorandum in
1998 by the FDA has only been tied to 31
cases of suicide or attempted suicide (af
fecting teens almost exclusively).
I'he had press Accutane has received
because of depression reported in some
teens (a group already prone to emotional
instability), and most recently by the sui
cide of the son of this high-profile politi
cian Rep. Bart Stupak, has pushed the
price of Accutane to over triple in market
value in the past five years, from approxi
mately $220 in the fall of 199f> to $800 in
the spring of 2001, while the price world
wide has remained comparatively low*.
Because of this, for anyone with less
than a lull coverage PPO health plan, the
option of taking this drug at an affordable
price is reduced to almost nill, with insur
ance companies refusing to authorize any
prescription coverage without an express
note from the physician documenting a
sustained history of severe (scarring) acne,
at which point the patient probably has ac
quired innumerable scars. However, for
those inflicted with persistent severe
nodular acne (not your occasional break
out), Accutane is the only medication on
the market that can even make a dent in
the acne population.

I n fact, it is viewed by many as a miracle
drug, for after treatment it entirely clears
up the complexion of people who do not
respond to all other orals and topicals
combined. Yel with all the bad press spec -
ulation and rumors, this medicine is in
danger of being pulled completely olf the
market by the FI)A, thus extinguishing the
only chance that many people like me will
have fora clear complexion.
High profile cases like the current one
and the recent one with politician's son have
thus disproportionately stigmatized a drug
that does not ailed most psychologically at
all. Before accusations are made or even im
| )lied, it is best to consider if temporary relief
ilit* public receives in attributing a drug to
otherwise tragic events is worth the harm it
will cause others who otherwise live with a
physical handicap.
♦figures based on prices quoted to me at
time of prescription.
Current Internet value lists one month
supply at $450 (90 pills(« $5/each:
