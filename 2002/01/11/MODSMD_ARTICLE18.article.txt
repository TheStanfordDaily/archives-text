Response to Shapiro letter
In Harris Shapiro's letter in the Jan. 10
edition of the Daily, heart uses Answers in
(ienesis Ministries (Ai(J) ofa religious bias.
I le is absolutely correct. I lowever, he ne
glects to acknowledge that all scientists
have a bias which determines the assump
tions they bring to their scientific investi
gation and the manner in which they in
terpret their data. I le calls "dubious" the
organization's theory that the earth has a
relatively young age, but he makes that
claim without addresses the scientific evi
dence that AiCi uses to support its theory.
In fact, this is the typical response of the
evolutionist establishment towards cre
ation science. Rather than acknowledge
the substantial problems that authentic
science poses for the theory that humans
evolved from molecules, evolutionists
write off creationists as "religious extrem
ists" and "unscientific," while never con
vincingly responding to their scientific ev
idence. In contrast to atheistic worldview
that allows for supernatural activity in our
world, many evolutionists have a material
istic worldview which posits that only mat
ter exists and nothing in our world occurs
without a natural cause. Since the origin of
our world is an experiment that cannot be
repeated, it takes just as much faith to be
lieve in evolution as to believe in creation.
Regardless, neither worldview
should disqualify a person from practic
ing real science, not should it be held
against them â€” only the merits of their
data and their interpretation of that
data should be considered.
In the '70s and '80s, creationists and
evolutionists often debated on college

campuses about the science behind their
respective theories of origins. Since many
creationist presentations were quite com
pelling to those audiences, most evolu
tionists have dec lined further opportunity
to debate the issue, though creationists are
still willing.
This refusal usually occurs in the form
of defensive accusations that creationists
"invent myths" or "manipulate words to
deceive the crowds," but again this does
not address the merit of creationists'scien
tifically reasonable claims. It would be
good if those debates were revived on col
lege campuses, including Stanford, so th;it
students would get to hear evidence on
both sides from"the horse's mouth" as op
posed to a single professor who accuses
one side of bias but does not admit the
ways he- is also biased.
Finally, Aid considers the Bible as an
authority on issues of science and history
because they believe that the Bible is in
spired by an all-knowing (iod and because
its predictions about science and history
have been reliable, whereas the science we
practice is dependent on interpretation of
data by fallible humans.
With regard to the appendix, it was an
evolutionary bias that instructed scientists
to believe that the appendix was only a ves
tige of our supposed evolutionary prede
cessors, while it was the creationist belief in
an thoughtful Designer that coincided
with the scientific evidence that the ap
pendix has a valuable function.
Conversely, it was the evolutionary
presupposition that there must be "miss
ing links" between apes and humans that
motivated scientists for over 30 years to
waste their doctorate research on Pilt

clown Man, a fraudulent fossil that was fi
nally exposed as a hoax in the 19505. A cre
ationist examining the fossil would have
had a more open mind, because he did not
share the same bias. Science is reliable but
not perfect, therefore AiG believes that we
should esteem God's Word above man's
"best educated guess."
The volume of scientific evidence col
lected in the last 150 years has meant that
it now requires even more faith to believe
in the Darwinian theory of origins than it
did when Darwin first proposed his ideas.
