### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Fresidder will Ik- quite a bit more colorful by
spring quarter if efforts by the ASSU and (he Stu
dent Organizing Committee for the Arts prove
successful.
Senior Seth Cohen, tlie committee's presi
dent, explained that both groups separately envi
sioned the same goal: to organize a student-run
mural art project that, once finished, will bring
life to a ctitrendy bare wall <>n 1 resiclder's sea >ticl
floor.
"The idea was that we wanted more student
managed and student-executed art visible on
campus," (lohen said.
ASSU h esident Matt Brewer added that the
arts are also important to this year's student gov
ernment.
"The arts have been a big priority for the
ASSU this year," he said. "They were part of our
platform. Murals are great because they can
bring lot.s of groups together and make state
ments that will capture the community."

Yesterday, Brewer released a campus-wide (all
for all artists interested in participating in the pro
ject, asking for students to submit |x>i if olios includ
ing samples of their work and creative ideas for the
mural itself!
()ne lead artist will be chosen to supervise the
entire project and be present at all times. I bis stu
dent will Ix' paid $ 1,000. In additic>n, a team of 10
to 20 "mural assistants" will be selected to work on
the creation of die mural; each will be paid $100.
(lohen added that I hi li groups are working to
see il the artists contributing to the project can re
ceive academic < redit from the University. "We're
also l(xiking for interested students to help with an
unveiling ceremony and publicity," said sopho
more katharina kircanski of the student commit
tee.
"We want to give lots of our peers a chance to
contribute and really feel that the wider our
reach within the Stanford arts community, the
more fulfilling the project will be for us all."
Furthermore, an advisory board consisting of
students, administrators and professional multil
ists will be selected. Brewer said that the board

will give those working on the project guidelines
for implementation.
Sonya Clark-1 lerrera, director of the Kast Palo
Alto Mural Alls Project, will also Ik' assisting the
board and artists by providing input on the logis
tics, budget and necessary supplies for the pro
ject.
In particular, Kircanski and sophomore Jess
Lee of SCKIA have been spearheading the pro
ject's organization.
"Jess and I came up with the mural idea at the
end of last year, as part of expanding S( XlA's in
volvement with the arts on campus â€” beyond
just the annual Art Affair," she said. "When we
learned that the ASSU was also interested in t his
type of a project, we decided it best to collabo
rate."
Brewer also attested to the benefits of having
the two groups combine their efforts.
"S( X 'A is very good at what they do .... They
have great connections with artists," Brewer said.
"We thought it would be better to put our
strengths together rather than create two sepa
rate murals."
