# Firm destroys Enron Corp. documents
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The firm that au
dited the books of collapsed Enron Corp.,
Arthur Andersen LLP. disclosed yesterday that
its employees had destroyed a "significant"
number of documents related to Enron. An
dersen said it didn't know whether its directive
to preserve documents demanded by govern
ment investigators was violated.
Federal law enforcement agencies and con
gressional investigators are seeking the doc u
ments as part of their inquiries into the failure*
of the giant energy-trading company, which
left countless investors burned and employees
out of work with billions of dollars of losses in
their Enron-heavy retirement accounts.
Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.) whose House En
ergy and Commerce Committee is among the
agencies and panels investigating, called the
destruction of documents "a deeply troubling
development."
"Anyone who destroyed records simply out
of stupidity should be fired. Anyone who de
stroyed records to try and subvert our investi
gation should be prosecuted," Tauzin said.
Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Tauzin, said
Andersen officials told committee investigators
yesterday that thousands of documents had

been destroyed.
Houston-based Enron entered last month
into the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S.
history.
Andersen's startling revelation added a new
twist to the Enron drama and raised fresh ques
tions about the role of the big accounting firm,
already under public scrutiny, whose legal
obligation is to blow the whistle if it detects
fraud at a company it audits.
At the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which is investigating Andersen's auditing work
for Enron, Enforcement Director Stephen M.
Cutler said destruction of documents "is obvi
ously an extremely serious matter."
"Documents are an essential ingredient in
our investigations," he said. "'l"he destruction of
documents by Arthur Andersen will not deter us
from pursuit of our investigation and will be in
cluded within the scope of our investigation."
I he SEC! is scrutinizing questionable part
nerships Enron used to keep some $500 million
in debt off its books and allow company execu
tives to profit from the arrangements.
Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting
firms, said in a statement that in recent
months, elec tronic files and the documents re

lated to its auditing of Lnron had been de
stroyed or deleted.
Later in the day, Andersen released another
statement saying documents were discarded in
the months before the SLC issued a subpoena
to the accounting firm as part of its investiga
tion, which began in October.
Andersen said in response to the subpoena, it
issued a directive to employees to preserve doc
uments but said that it has not been able to de
termine whether that instruction was violated.
On the other hand, Chicago-based Ander
sen said its company policy "required in certain
circumstances the destruction of certain types
of documents."
However, the firm said, millions oI docu
ments related to Huron still exist, and it has man
aged to retrieve some of the deleted electronic
files. Andersen said it is continuing retrieval ef
forts through electronic backup files, "and is con
tinuing in its efforts to fully learn and under
stand all the facts related to this issue."
Andersen has asked John Danforth, the for
mer Missouri attorney general and U.S. sena
tor, "to conduct an immediate and comprehen
sive review of Andersen's records management
policy and to recommend improvements."
