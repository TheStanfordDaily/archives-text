2 lead in the first five minutes of
the game thanks to an aggressive
man defense and a transition of
fense that was spearheaded by 10
points from senior center Bethany
Donaphin.
"I think it's the ultimate compli
ment," said head coach l ara Van-
Derveer after her team's victory.
"This is like old-time Stanford bas
ketball. We're getting out there and
running the ball."
Stanford continued to control
the pace of the game in the first
half, leading by as much as 25
points with 8:22 left, as Oregon
State switched defenses and play
ers in an attempt to slow down
the Card.
"Donaphin did a great job going
rim to rim and I think that made a
difference for (Stanford]," said
Beavers' head coach Judy Spoel

stra. "Credit Stanford because
their transition game was on. This
is a very good Stanford team."
As ii the inside combination of
Donaphin and freshman forward
TNae Thiel, who finished with 11
and 13 respectively, wasn't enough
for the Beavers to handle, Oregon
State also had to deal with a Stan
ford backcourt that nailed eight
three-pointers on the night, includ
ing four from sophomore forward
Nicole Powell.
Powell was one assist shy of her
fourth career triple-double as she
finished with 20 points, 13 re
hounds and nine assists.
The Beavers finally responded
to the Cardinal assault with a full
court press that allowed Oregon
State to end the first half on an 11-5
run, bringing the score to 48-34.
Oregon State returned to the
game in the second half and con
tinued to put on die full-court
pressure before falling back into a
/one defense. The Beavers' ef
forts gave the Cardinal some
trouble, including nearly six min
utes during which Stanford was
held to five points.
The Cardinal ended the
drought with a 20-2 run that effec
tively sealed the game.
Heading the Beavers' charge
was Pac-10 leading scorer, senior
Felicia Ragland.


SEVGI YUKSEI/The Stanford Daily
As the referee and the home crowd look on, senior forward / center Bethany
Donaphin fends off a defenseless Oregon State player as she lays the ball up
for two of her 11 total points.
Ragland. who had been averag
ing 20.3 points per game, finished
with 20 on the night.
"We had wanted to hold her
under hei average," VanDerveer
said. "But they got one [scorer] in
double figures and we've got five."
Indeed, all the Stanford starters
ended the game in double-digits, as
senior guard Lindsey Yamasaki put
in 12 points and freshman point
guard Kelley Suminski scored 13.
Suminski. stepping in for sopho
more Susan King after her season
ending injury, was credited with
helping lead the new transition
game.
"Kelley put in a lot of work this
week," VanDerveer said. "She
stayed late and watched a lot of
videos and worked with the coach
ing staff."
For her part, Suminski acknowl
edged the team's efforts to lill the
lanes and run the court to get the
pass off the dribble.
"I pushed it, but everyone was
there for it," Suminski said.
I he Cardinal's transition game
was propelled by its depth, as every
able-bodied member took to the
court, and senior Lauren St. Clair
continued to make critical contribu
tions as a reserve.
St. Clair finished with 8 points,
including two three-pointers in only
17 minutes of play.
With only two players held score
less, the Stanford bench proved a
formidable team in its own right. If
tonight is any indication, the efforts

from the reserves will continue to
push the tempo and level of'the Car
dinal's game.
"We're able to take advantage of
our depth." VanDerveer s;iid. "I'm
really pleased with where we are.
I his game gives us good momen
tum to cany us into the next lew
games."
The Cardinal will prepare to
host the Oregon Ducks on Sunday
as it lights to remain undefeated in
the Pac-10.
"We're working on pushing the
ball, sprinting ever) single game
and using our depth," Powell said.
II tonight's game was the result
of such <i strategy, then the remain
der of the Cardinal's road looks
very good — all the way to tlie end
of March.

Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford
9,1 Oregon State 54

2 lead in the first five minutes of
the game thanks to an aggressive
man defense and a transition of
fense that was spearheaded by 10
points from senior center Bethany
Donaphin.
"I think it's the ultimate compli
ment," said head coach l ara Van-
Derveer after her team's victory.
"This is like old-time Stanford bas
ketball. We're getting out there and
running the ball."
Stanford continued to control
the pace of the game in the first
half, leading by as much as 25
points with 8:22 left, as Oregon
State switched defenses and play
ers in an attempt to slow down
the Card.
"Donaphin did a great job going
rim to rim and I think that made a
difference for (Stanford]," said
Beavers' head coach Judy Spoel

stra. "Credit Stanford because
their transition game was on. This
is a very good Stanford team."
As ii the inside combination of
Donaphin and freshman forward
TNae Thiel, who finished with 11
and 13 respectively, wasn't enough
for the Beavers to handle, Oregon
State also had to deal with a Stan
ford backcourt that nailed eight
three-pointers on the night, includ
ing four from sophomore forward
Nicole Powell.
Powell was one assist shy of her
fourth career triple-double as she
finished with 20 points, 13 re
hounds and nine assists.
The Beavers finally responded
to the Cardinal assault with a full
court press that allowed Oregon
State to end the first half on an 11-5
run, bringing the score to 48-34.
Oregon State returned to the
game in the second half and con
tinued to put on die full-court
pressure before falling back into a
/one defense. The Beavers' ef
forts gave the Cardinal some
trouble, including nearly six min
utes during which Stanford was
held to five points.
The Cardinal ended the
drought with a 20-2 run that effec
tively sealed the game.
Heading the Beavers' charge
was Pac-10 leading scorer, senior
Felicia Ragland.


SEVGI YUKSEI/The Stanford Daily
As the referee and the home crowd look on, senior forward / center Bethany
Donaphin fends off a defenseless Oregon State player as she lays the ball up
for two of her 11 total points.
Ragland. who had been averag
ing 20.3 points per game, finished
with 20 on the night.
"We had wanted to hold her
under hei average," VanDerveer
said. "But they got one [scorer] in
double figures and we've got five."
Indeed, all the Stanford starters
ended the game in double-digits, as
senior guard Lindsey Yamasaki put
in 12 points and freshman point
guard Kelley Suminski scored 13.
Suminski. stepping in for sopho
more Susan King after her season
ending injury, was credited with
helping lead the new transition
game.
"Kelley put in a lot of work this
week," VanDerveer said. "She
stayed late and watched a lot of
videos and worked with the coach
ing staff."
For her part, Suminski acknowl
edged the team's efforts to lill the
lanes and run the court to get the
pass off the dribble.
"I pushed it, but everyone was
there for it," Suminski said.
I he Cardinal's transition game
was propelled by its depth, as every
able-bodied member took to the
court, and senior Lauren St. Clair
continued to make critical contribu
tions as a reserve.
St. Clair finished with 8 points,
including two three-pointers in only
17 minutes of play.
With only two players held score
less, the Stanford bench proved a
formidable team in its own right. If
tonight is any indication, the efforts

from the reserves will continue to
push the tempo and level of'the Car
dinal's game.
"We're able to take advantage of
our depth." VanDerveer s;iid. "I'm
really pleased with where we are.
I his game gives us good momen
tum to cany us into the next lew
games."
The Cardinal will prepare to
host the Oregon Ducks on Sunday
as it lights to remain undefeated in
the Pac-10.
"We're working on pushing the
ball, sprinting ever) single game
and using our depth," Powell said.
II tonight's game was the result
of such <i strategy, then the remain
der of the Cardinal's road looks
very good — all the way to tlie end
of March.
