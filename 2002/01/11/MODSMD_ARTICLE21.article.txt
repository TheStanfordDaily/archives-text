WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford
9,1 Oregon State 54

2 lead in the first five minutes of
the game thanks to an aggressive
man defense and a transition of
fense that was spearheaded by 10
points from senior center Bethany
Donaphin.
"I think it's the ultimate compli
ment," said head coach l ara Van-
Derveer after her team's victory.
"This is like old-time Stanford bas
ketball. We're getting out there and
running the ball."
Stanford continued to control
the pace of the game in the first
half, leading by as much as 25
points with 8:22 left, as Oregon
State switched defenses and play
ers in an attempt to slow down
the Card.
"Donaphin did a great job going
rim to rim and I think that made a
difference for (Stanford]," said
Beavers' head coach Judy Spoel

stra. "Credit Stanford because
their transition game was on. This
is a very good Stanford team."
As ii the inside combination of
Donaphin and freshman forward
TNae Thiel, who finished with 11
and 13 respectively, wasn't enough
for the Beavers to handle, Oregon
State also had to deal with a Stan
ford backcourt that nailed eight
three-pointers on the night, includ
ing four from sophomore forward
Nicole Powell.
Powell was one assist shy of her
fourth career triple-double as she
finished with 20 points, 13 re
hounds and nine assists.
The Beavers finally responded
to the Cardinal assault with a full
court press that allowed Oregon
State to end the first half on an 11-5
run, bringing the score to 48-34.
Oregon State returned to the
game in the second half and con
tinued to put on die full-court
pressure before falling back into a
/one defense. The Beavers' ef
forts gave the Cardinal some
trouble, including nearly six min
utes during which Stanford was
held to five points.
The Cardinal ended the
drought with a 20-2 run that effec
tively sealed the game.
Heading the Beavers' charge
was Pac-10 leading scorer, senior
Felicia Ragland.
