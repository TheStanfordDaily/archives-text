### JACOB SAPERSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There can be no doubt why flit' No. 1 (lar
dinal (15-1, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) is fa
vored to win the Pac-lOand advance to its sev
enth Final Four.
In the 91-54 victory over die Oregon State
Beavers (8-8,4-S), the team looked dominant
in every aspect of die game. 1 he lone behind
the attack was clearly sophomore forward
Nicole Powell.
Powell finished the game with 20 points. IS
rebounds and nine assists in 25 minutes. She
left the game with less than six minutes left,
one assist short of her second career triple
double. I lowever, these remarkable numbers
still underscore her importance to the team.
Against the Beavers, number 14 was every
where, having a part in every big play. In the
first half, when the Cardinal went on a 19-2
run to take over the game, Powell played a
role in live of the nine scoring plays. Whether
making the basket herself, assisting a team
mate or converting a defensive rebound into
a last break, Powell was unstoppable.
" The first 10 minutes, it was really easy,"
Powell said. "We were all on the same page. I
love that kind of basketball. Itwasalot offiin."
Powell has developed into one of the na
tion's top players, coming in first in a Real
sports.com online poll this week for best play
er in the nation.
"I think great players lead their teams to
championships," said head coach lata Van-
Derveer. " That's the challenge for Nicole.
[Connecticut's! Sue Bird has done it and the

challenge lor Nicole is to take us to that
promised land."
Powell's refusal to lose was clear early in
the second hall. With lour seconds left on
the shot ( lock. Powell was guarded right
outside the three-point line. With no other
choice, ii was evident thai she had to take
the shot herself, first, she pump-faked.
I hen, wilh an Oregon State defender in
the air, she leaned in and made a three
pointer to put i he (Cardinal up 58-43.
Two minutes later, with the team having
trouble scoring, Powell grabbed a miss by
freshman Kelley Suminski out of the hands of
a Beaver player and banked it in to give the
(lardinal a 17-point lead.
With 10:36 remaining in the game, Powell
showed more of her tenacity, playing hard at
every moment. Falling out of bounds, she
jumped up and tipped a teammate's miss in
lor two, increasing the lead to 20. The play
was the final nail in the Beavers' coffin, as the
(lardinal played inspired basketball lor the
rest of the game.
On defense, Powell also seemed to be
everywhere on the floor at once. With the (lar
dinal playing full-court pressure, Powell
swarmed to the hall, Ibrcing turnovers and
converting defensive stops to points on the
other side ol the court.
I.ike most of the games this season, the
scoring was distributed fairly evenly among
the (lardinal players, as .ill live starters scored
in double-digits. Nevertheless. Powell's ability
to dominate in every facet of the game was ev
ident against the Beavers. Whatever the team
needed, she was there to provide it.
