three-pointer and then took a
perfect pass from junior center
Curtis Borchardt and made an
other layup to give the Cardinal
(9-3,2-1 Pacific: 10 Conference) a
39-38 lead.
"Me was huge," said senior
point guard Tony Giovacchini. "I
wasn't hitting shots, Julius

tich] wasn't hitting and it was
lough to get the ball inside to Cur
tis | Borchardt]. For him to step up
and hit a couple of shots meant a
lot to us."
And once Childress set the ex
ample, his teammates followed suit.
junior Casey Jacobsen, who
had struggled up to that point, fi
nally nailed a three. Me then took
a behind-the-back pass from
Barnes and made a two-handed
slam. Barnes then added a three
pointer and the Cardinal was back
in business with a 51-40 lead.
When Childress first entered
the game, Jacobsen was already on
the bench in foul trouble, and
Stanford was having trouble find
ing a dependable shooter.
Barnes had tried first to fill the
role, but he missed a 10-foot
jumper.
Borchardt was next, but was
blocked by the Beavers' Brian
Jackson.
Finally, I lernandez drove the
lane, but he turned the ball over.

An eerie trend had started to
emerge, as an 1 1 -2 lead was quick
ly cut to 11-9.
But then, Childress emerged.
I It' scored 10 points in the first
hall and helped the Cardinal
keep its head above water when it
desperately needed to. Asa team,
Stanford shot 33.3 percent from
the field in the first half, includ
ing I of 8 from outside the three
point arc.
"I missed a couple of shots
early, but then they started to go in
and everything just started to
role," (Ihildress said.
It was conceivable that the Car
dinal would have trailed at the half
had Childress not contributed the
way he had. The Cardinal entered
the locker room at halftime with
only a 27-21 lead.
"Once [Josh] found out he was
going to have to make shots, he
lound a way," Montgomery said.
Nobody could have been more
frustrated than Jacobsen. Al
though he finished with 15 points
on 5 of 12 shooting, he picked up
two fouls in the first 3:50 of the
game and then was forced to the
bench with his third foul with
12:52 left in the first half when he
tried to go through a screen.
" That was rough. That will hap
pen maybe once; year," Jacobsen
said ol his comm ting three fouls
in one half. " That third foul, I was
just standing then and they used a
screen on me. The contact's going
to happen, but th.it wasn't a loul."
Borchardt finished with 17
points, going 7 of 13 from the field
and grabbing IS rebounds for his
sixth double-double of the season.
"Curtis just went to the ball very
aggressively, and that's the kind of
thing he needs to do," Mont
