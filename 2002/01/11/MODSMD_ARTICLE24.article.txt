MEN'S SWIMMING
Tonight: No. 1 Stanford at No. 1 2 Michigan, 3
p.m., Ann Arbor, Mich.
Tomorrow: No. 1 Stanford at No. 12 Michi
gan, 10 a.m., Ann Arbor, Mich.

The C Cardinal is just emerging from a grueling win
ter training, and this dual meet is just the second of
the rac ing season that began with an earlier victory
over Cal State-Bakersfield.
"It's a really good chance to gel up and race right
off of Christmas training with Michigan traditionally
being one of our big rivals," said senior tri-captain
Peter Lennox-King.
Although tin* polls show Michigan as the weaker
squad, the (Cardinal is not taking anything lor granted.
"Their ranking might be a little deceptive because
they're always a strong team, particularly in the (lis

tance events," Lennox-King said.
Junior Dan Westcott agreed.
"We're approaching this meet with everything we
have," he said. "Two years ago we went there and they
beat us; they handed our hats to us."
The Cardinal will be aware of this fact as it was also
the stronger team that year.
The Wolverines historically boast a strong core of
distance swimmers, having turned out numerous
Olympians in distance freestyle and the 400-yard in
dividual medley.
Senior Tim Siciliano, sophomore Dan Ketchum
and freshman Andrew I furd are poised to lead Michi
gan's distance program this year. Sit iliano is Â«i three
time NC AA champion in the 400 individual medley
and has continued to perform successfully in that
event. I le has also swam well in the distance lieestyles.
In other events, redshirt junior and Palo Alto na
tive Jeff Hopwood will be competitive in the breast
stroke events.
Because Michigan is stronger in the distance
events, the Cardinal will need to dominate the
shorter events in order to win. True to its top rank,
the Cardinal possesses both the speed and the
depth to get the job done.
