When Dean of Undergraduate Admission Robin
Mamlet first saw the theatrical trailer tor the new film
"Orange County" — which opens today — she
wasn't exactly thrilled.
"1 was absolutely shocked that a movie would show
[a fictitious Stanford] dean of admission making a pass
at a prospective student," she said.
But that's not all the movie shows.
A joint venture bv Paramount Pictures and MTV
Films, "Orange County" is a comedy about a high
school senior — played by Colin I lanks, son of actor
Tom 1 lanks — who gets rejected by Stanford after his
guidance counselor sends in the wrong transcript.
To set tilings straight, 1 lanks' character decides to
take a road trip with his brother (Jack Black) from
their home in Orange County to the University.
The theatrical trailer for the film shows Black
breaking into the office of admission to find the dean's
home address and then, after a sexual fling with one
of the office assistants, the actor is seen setting fire to
the building.
"It's a fantasy," Mamlet said. "I recognize that the
movie is a satire. There's no intent to depict reality.
I'm not terribly disturbed."
Mamlet added that the premise is not plausible
because the Admissions Office would catch the mis
take if a guidance counselor sent in a students'
wrong transcript.
"1 can't think of any time when we have had a tran
script without someone's name on it," she said. "We
call the school a great deal during the application re
viewing process."
But one element of the film appears to imitate
life. Mamlet said that some high school students
have tried to contact her after getting rejected from
