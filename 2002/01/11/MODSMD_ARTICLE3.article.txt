When Dean of Undergraduate Admission Robin
Mamlet first saw the theatrical trailer tor the new film
"Orange County" — which opens today — she
wasn't exactly thrilled.
"1 was absolutely shocked that a movie would show
[a fictitious Stanford] dean of admission making a pass
at a prospective student," she said.
But that's not all the movie shows.
A joint venture bv Paramount Pictures and MTV
Films, "Orange County" is a comedy about a high
school senior — played by Colin I lanks, son of actor
Tom 1 lanks — who gets rejected by Stanford after his
guidance counselor sends in the wrong transcript.
To set tilings straight, 1 lanks' character decides to
take a road trip with his brother (Jack Black) from
their home in Orange County to the University.
The theatrical trailer for the film shows Black
breaking into the office of admission to find the dean's
home address and then, after a sexual fling with one
of the office assistants, the actor is seen setting fire to
the building.
"It's a fantasy," Mamlet said. "I recognize that the
movie is a satire. There's no intent to depict reality.
I'm not terribly disturbed."
Mamlet added that the premise is not plausible
because the Admissions Office would catch the mis
take if a guidance counselor sent in a students'
wrong transcript.
"1 can't think of any time when we have had a tran
script without someone's name on it," she said. "We
call the school a great deal during the application re
viewing process."
But one element of the film appears to imitate
life. Mamlet said that some high school students
have tried to contact her after getting rejected from

" There have been times when
people have pushed the envelope.
There's a student every year who
thinks if he camps out long
enough or il he can just talk to the
clean of admission, we'll let him in.
"It's part of the territory," she
said. "I think that's what can make
this movie funny."
In the film, Stanford's Dean of
Admission is played by Harold
Ramis. After he is approached, he
makes a pass at Hanks' character,
is drugged and passes out.
According to Kate Chesley, as
sociate director of University com
munications, Paramount original
ly intended for the dean of admis
sion in the film to be a woman.
"I believe they were worried
about defamation and changed
the script," Chesley said.
"On a personal note, I find it
hard to see the work of our col
leagues in admission de
meaned," she added. "I doubt

this film will accurately portray
the commitment of our staff.
Filmmakers often forget they arc
portraying real people with real
families."
Jhe movie's writer, Mike
White, wrote for the critically-ac
claimed but short-lived I V show
"Freaks and Geeks." In material
released to the press, he said, "I
never tried to get into Stanford,
but I grew up in Southern Califor
nia and had relatives in Orange
County."
Mamlet said she plans on see
ing the movie. "We'll probably
make it a stall Outing," she said.
"Orange County" was not shot
on the Stanford campus. Instead,
Paramount reported that the
movie was filmed "in a variety of
Southern California locations, in
cluding Malibu and several idyllic
spots to its north." The on-cam
pus scenes were shot at CalTech
and I S(
"They never asked us to film on
campus," Chesley said. "Had they
asked, we would have declined as
we do in almost all cases. Film
making tends to be very intrusive
and clifliculi to reconcile with the

needs of students and faculty."
(-hesley said Paramount did ask
to use Stanford's trademark in the
film, but the I niversity declined to
give the studio permission.
"We then asked Paramount to
preview the film," Chesley said.
"They declined and told us they
believe the film clearly meets the
definition of parody [which may
free the studio of liability)."
A representative from Para
mount did not return The Daily's
phone calls.
Mamlet said she hoped the film
was handled with taste.
"I'm hoping it's funny and en
tertaining," she said. " There's so
much stress about applying for
college, that if it makes students
laugh, then that's a nice thing."
But sophomore [ess Lang, who
saw the film at an advance screen
ing, said she didn't laugh at all.
"It was just awful," Lang said.
"It wasn't funny. Basically, all the
movie did was kill brain cells."
" I here was really no Stanford
humor," she added. "It could
have taken place at any other col
lege. Actually, it was filmed at an
other college."

When Dean of Undergraduate Admission Robin
Mamlet first saw the theatrical trailer tor the new film
"Orange County" — which opens today — she
wasn't exactly thrilled.
"1 was absolutely shocked that a movie would show
[a fictitious Stanford] dean of admission making a pass
at a prospective student," she said.
But that's not all the movie shows.
A joint venture bv Paramount Pictures and MTV
Films, "Orange County" is a comedy about a high
school senior — played by Colin I lanks, son of actor
Tom 1 lanks — who gets rejected by Stanford after his
guidance counselor sends in the wrong transcript.
To set tilings straight, 1 lanks' character decides to
take a road trip with his brother (Jack Black) from
their home in Orange County to the University.
The theatrical trailer for the film shows Black
breaking into the office of admission to find the dean's
home address and then, after a sexual fling with one
of the office assistants, the actor is seen setting fire to
the building.
"It's a fantasy," Mamlet said. "I recognize that the
movie is a satire. There's no intent to depict reality.
I'm not terribly disturbed."
Mamlet added that the premise is not plausible
because the Admissions Office would catch the mis
take if a guidance counselor sent in a students'
wrong transcript.
"1 can't think of any time when we have had a tran
script without someone's name on it," she said. "We
call the school a great deal during the application re
viewing process."
