# Wilco turns 180 degrees to pop
## 
### SCOTT DORFMAN 
For fans of alternative country music, also affection
ately known as y'allternative, Americana, No Depression
or Anti-Garth music, Wilco's Jeff I weedy is both a re
spected and polarizing figure. As a founding member of
t lie seminal early 1990s group Uncle Tupelo, Tweedy lit
erally created and defined the genre of alternative coun
try, a rock and country hybrid style that rebelled against
the cookie-cutter cowboy love songs emanating out of
Nashville at the time. Tweedy wrote songs reminiscent of

Monday, Dcc. 3 ''/)
The Fillmore

old-fashi on e d
country music,
songs about moon
shiners and
coal miners, the
front porch and
the open road.
Now split from Tu
pelo and heading

l o
up Wilco, many fans — myself included — believe
Tweedy has almost completely forgotten his alt-country
roots and moved into the mainstream of American pop
music, a big disappointment to those who found his orig
inal work with Tupelo so refreshing.
Wilco's performance at The Fillmore on Dec. 3rd, the
group's third sold-out night in a row at the venue, did
nothing to dispel either assumption that I brought into the
show: Tweedy is a musical genius and Wilco wants des
perately to rid itself of its alt-country roots. In town to pro
mote their soon to be released album, "Yankee I lotel Fox
trot," Wilco played a nearly two-hour set that included a
number of songs from Foxtrot and 2000 s critically ac
claimed "Summer Teeth," as well as a few from 1995's
"A.M." and 1998 s "Being There." The never-before
heard new songs seemed to connect with the audience,
and many were indeed catchy as hell, with melodic pop
hooks and clever lyrics like "I miss the innocence I've

known / Playing K.I.S.S. covers, beautiful and stoned."
I lie old Wilto songs, particularly "Being There"'s
"Monday" and "Summer Teeth'"s "Shot in the Ann," were
as powerful as ever, a tribute to the band's ability to quick
ly adapt to new keyboardist Leroy Bach and new drum
mer Glen Kotche. Kotchein particular seemed to bring an
added dimension to the band, utilizing every percussion
instrument I've ever seen and a few that I haven't, in-

cluding one that looked like an artificial inhaler for
asthma patients that produced a thunderous back
ground noise. The current Wilco ensemble seems to
be the most innovative and talented group of musi
cians headed by Tweedy thus far, high praise consid
ering Tweedy's previous work with Tupelo and alt
country all-star group Golden Smog.
Not exactly the most comfortable of performers.
Tweedy seemed to grow more relaxed as the show
progressed. His overarching shyness and resolute re
fusal to self-medicate (while the rest of the band
drank Anchor Steam throughout the show, Tweedy
stuck to Diet Coke) gave him a quirky charm that en
deared him to the audience. Tweedy's inability to
look at or interact with the crowd put the focus
squarely on YVilco's music, but he eventually lifted his
head and opened his mouth after an hour or so, cul
minating in a rousing closing audience sing-a-long to
A.M.'s fabulous "Passenger Side." I had never seen a
musician at once so in control of an audience and so
seemingly scared of it.
It is difficult to find any negatives in Wilco's per
formance, their new songs or their new musicians,
but as I exited the show I still felt a little disappoint
ed. In truth, while Tweedy still makes ingenious
music, he has done a 180-degree turn from his work
in Uncle Tupelo in terms of style and substance. His
songs are now laden with pop melodies, the twangy

country guitars are gone, and the subject matter is often
not far from the love and relationships formula that so
characterizes modern day pop and pop-country music. I
guess I just couldn't shake the feeling that 1 was lot like
Dana Carvey's grumpy old man character on Saturday
Night Live after Wilco's show: "In my day, Jeff Tweedy
sang songs about drinking, driving and dying. And that's
the way it was and we liked it."

and many were indeed catchy as hell, with melodic pop
hooks and clever lyrics like "I miss the innocence I've

known / Playing K.I.S.S. covers, beautiful and stoned."
I lie old Wilto songs, particularly "Being There"'s
"Monday" and "Summer Teeth'"s "Shot in the Ann," were
as powerful as ever, a tribute to the band's ability to quick
ly adapt to new keyboardist Leroy Bach and new drum
mer Glen Kotche. Kotchein particular seemed to bring an
added dimension to the band, utilizing every percussion
instrument I've ever seen and a few that I haven't, in-

cluding one that looked like an artificial inhaler for
asthma patients that produced a thunderous back
ground noise. The current Wilco ensemble seems to
be the most innovative and talented group of musi
cians headed by Tweedy thus far, high praise consid
ering Tweedy's previous work with Tupelo and alt
country all-star group Golden Smog.
Not exactly the most comfortable of performers.
Tweedy seemed to grow more relaxed as the show
progressed. His overarching shyness and resolute re
fusal to self-medicate (while the rest of the band
drank Anchor Steam throughout the show, Tweedy
stuck to Diet Coke) gave him a quirky charm that en
deared him to the audience. Tweedy's inability to
look at or interact with the crowd put the focus
squarely on YVilco's music, but he eventually lifted his
head and opened his mouth after an hour or so, cul
minating in a rousing closing audience sing-a-long to
A.M.'s fabulous "Passenger Side." I had never seen a
musician at once so in control of an audience and so
seemingly scared of it.
It is difficult to find any negatives in Wilco's per
formance, their new songs or their new musicians,
but as I exited the show I still felt a little disappoint
ed. In truth, while Tweedy still makes ingenious
music, he has done a 180-degree turn from his work
in Uncle Tupelo in terms of style and substance. His
songs are now laden with pop melodies, the twangy

country guitars are gone, and the subject matter is often
not far from the love and relationships formula that so
characterizes modern day pop and pop-country music. I
guess I just couldn't shake the feeling that 1 was lot like
Dana Carvey's grumpy old man character on Saturday
Night Live after Wilco's show: "In my day, Jeff Tweedy
sang songs about drinking, driving and dying. And that's
the way it was and we liked it."


Surgeon General's warning: pop kills.
