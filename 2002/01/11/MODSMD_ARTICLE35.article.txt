Jonathan Beard
1. Mich Jagger • "Goddess in the Doorway" Out of
nowhere, an album that is not only the best of his solo
career, but better than anything the Rolling Stones
have done in over two decades. In better vocal form
than ever,Jagger gives us an album of vulnerability,
love, craft and emotion.
2. Alicia Keys - "Songs in A Minor" The freshest and
most exciting debut to hit the mainstream this year.
3. Double Trouble - "Been a Long Time" Ever since Ste
vie Ray Vaughn died just over a decade ago, there
has been nothing from his band. This record is their
re-ei Mergence,
4. Prime - "The Rainbow Children" With his original
name, IYince delivers his l>est album sitae he ( hanged
his name in the first place.'lhe lyrics'spiritual message
is almost im|)ossihle to decipher, and the Danh-Vaclcr
like narrator gets slightly cloying, but who cares — the
music is great.
5. Zero 7 - "Simple Things" The mellow-music album
of the year. (See review).

Douglas Wilson
I.Stereolab-"Sound-Dusf' | isl keep getting Ix'tter and better. A fresh, funky piece of
quirky jazz-pop fusion, replete with irresistible, colorful tracks. Far and away thelx*st
album of the year and more evidence of Stereolab's genius.
2.MaxGudtant- "Transport4"Shows the world that France has some life in it yet.
Intelligent, vibrant, and beautifully mixed, the album is a wonderful reminder
that dance techno need not and should not follow the threadbare, timeworn
old formula.
3.Aphex Twin -"Druktjs" Richard James finally returns to the electronica scene — in
full glory. An innovative, Ix rserk combination of old and new styles. Not only a treat
for the techno fans, but for all ojx'ii-minded music lovers ready for something com
pletely different
4.Radnhead- "Amnesiac" A satisfying new step in the band's continuing ai list Revo
lution. Possesses the polish that Kid A sometime lacks. Radiohead hits completely
mastered their eerie variety of lock-techno fusion.
5. Deep Dish-"Yoshiesque2" A crtchy, in-your-face, double-disc mix of house, this tech
no-fiink l< wechild demonstrates that dance electronica need not be dark ;uid at mos
pheric, but should also sometimes lx* grooving fun.
JungLah
1. Propaganda -"Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes" Politics and melodic hardcore
have rarefy been fused in a more intelligent or relentless fashion. Sophisticated Cana
dian thought-punk that will educate you as you listen.
2. The Get-Up Kids - "Eudora" This ever-awesome Kansas Gty collective may be hit- J
ring the big-time (i.e., opening for Weezer and Green Day), yet it still knows how to
throw down tracks that will emo your socks off.
3. New bid Original - IWfer" Jonah Matranga turns his solo project Onelinedraw
ing up a few notches, ai id the result is a lull-out rock b;ind including former mem
bers of I exas Is Hie Reason and Shelter. "Lukewarm'' is my favorite single in ages.
4. The Coup - "Party Musk" lfafl hip hop was this dope, the world lie a better
place. Sociopolitical activist rap thai (overs police brutality, gender inequality, revo
jutionaty action and funky back-beats. Concerning the album title: the "party" in
''Patty Music" ain't referring to Republicans.
5. Jimmy Eat World- "Bleed American" Power pop at its finest. Ihe band may have
signed onto Dreamworks and played on the Warped Tour, but they sound better
than they did on the 1999 album "Clarity."

Michael Baer
1. Aikttc Brooks - "Swim With Me" Local girl makes
gocxl Stanford a'um Brooks delivers an aibutn which
meets and exceeds the quality of the mainstream. Eas
ily better than the latest Ani DiFraiko.
2. Sets - "Souljatker" Worth ordering from Canada to
get this one. About trying to find one's bearings in
a world of chaos and loss, this not only rocks, but is
timely.
3. Whiskeytown - u Pneumonia" Ryan Adams' List before
going solo/Hiese songs stay with you —in a very gtxxJ J
way.
4. Poe - "Haunted" flaunting /nix of rock, hip-lit >p and
sampled spoken word, this is a lot more than the single,
"Hey Pretty."
Kareem Ghanem
1. Fugazi • "The Argument" ()ne of their best releas
es yet. (See review).
2. De la Soul • "IBionix" For over a decade, De La
Soul has been creating intelligent hip-hop music
with a good measure of humor and fun thrown in.
l he tradition continues.
3. Dealership - "TV Highway to the Stan" This Berke
ley indie-pop trio has surprised everyone with this
collection of sweet, wistful songs. Not ground
breaking, per se, but manages to stay introspec
tive while seducing you with its pop hooks.
4. The Coup - "Party Musit" Even if you disagree with
their politics, this Oakland rap group is underrated.
Slick production, clever rhymes, and a twist of funk —
the best albnm the group has ever released.
5. Bjork • "Vespertine" The first track, "Hidden
Place,' features cool operatic vocals and Bjork's
gently uttered lyrics — it is eccentric without be
coming overbearing, and fragile while remaining
visceral.
