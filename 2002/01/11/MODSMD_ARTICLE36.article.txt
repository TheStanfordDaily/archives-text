# Fugazi refuses to kowtow to commercialism
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
During their first American
tour, Pearl Jam visited Wash
ington, D.C. There, guides
took Eddie Vedder to visit the
various monuments in and
around the nation's capital.
The singer, unimpressed,
asked instead to be taken across
the Potomac to a small house in
Arlington, Virginia.
That house is home to
Dischord Records. Among the
many bands on the fiercely inde
pendent record label is Fugazi, a
group long admired by Vedder,
Michael Stipe and the late Kurt
Cobain, as well as a host of non
celebrity fans, since iis birth in the
late 1980s.
Over the course of more than a
decade, Fugazi has earned praise
for its high principles and refusal
to kowtow to the commercialism
of the record industry. While they

were si ill teenagers playing in the
infamous hardcore outfit Minor
I hreat, a couple ol Fuga/.i's
members founded Dischord

Records. To this
date, the label
has released all
Fugazi albums,
charging a mere
$10 for CDs.
Oh, and if it

isn't already clear, they will
NOT sign to a major label, hav
ing already turned down more
than a few very lucrative offers,
fry explaining that to bands like
U2, Aerosmith, the Rolling
Stones or even Pearl Jam, whose
legal wrangling with Ticketmas
ter is put to shame by Fugazi, a
band that charges only five
bucks for shows.
More than 10 years have
elapsed since the release of
Fugazi's most well known albums
— the seminal "13 Songs" and

equally influential "Repeater."
From the beginning, the band
has reiterated its dedication to
writing creative music that chal-

lenges its audience.
With a distinguished
discography of post
punk and hardcore al
liums, it continues
doing just that on the
full-length "The Argu-

merit" and three-song single
" Furniture."
The LP's title track appears
last on the CI), but is arguably its
brightest song. Musically, it
mixes lugazi's signature stutter
ing drums and harsh electric gui
tars with experimental elements
such as a dreamy sounding elec
tric keyboard and cello. The
lyrics take to task those who
would silence dissenting voices in
a civil society.
"Epic Problem," another ex
cellent song, is cleverly crafted

with amazing guitar work and vo
cals that subtly alternate between
crunching, angry aggression and
a tenderly delivered, yet com
manding chorus.
Also notable is the fifth track,
"Life and Limb." Employing a
guitar riff with slight echoes of the
late 70s punk band Television, it
questions how a nation can use vi
olence in defense of liberty and
compassion. A guest appearance
by former Bikini Kill bassist Kathi
Wilcox on vocals adds another
layer of depth to the track. Her
voice mingles with singer lan
MacKaye's to create ;i hazy, pen
sive sound.
"Furniture," a single which
does not appear on the LP, con
tains three songs. While they dif
fer greatly in character from the
songs on the album, they are still
worth a listen.
"Number 5," the second track,
is a hard, fast and raw hardcore

instrumental that made for quite
a bit ol fun when I cranked it up
in the car. Hie last song, "Hello
Morning," is reminiscent of the
band's older sound, driven pri
marily by lan Mac kaye's barking
vocals and screams.
With each of its members in his
30s, Fugazi is a dinosaur by punk
rock standards. Nonetheless,
they have avoided becoming to
the indie world what the Rolling
Stones are to mainstream rock: a
veritable nostalgia act that long
passed their prime.
Needless to say, this pair of re
leases will ensure that bandmates
Brendan Canty, Joe Lally, lan
MacKaye and Guy l'icciotto con
tinue to be taken very seriously by
fans, critics and musicians alike.
Reaffirming its relevance in a
changing musical world, Fugazi's
music continues to evolve in a wa\
that is refreshing, intelligent and,
dare one say, graceful.

of the record industry. While they

were si ill teenagers playing in the
infamous hardcore outfit Minor
I hreat, a couple ol Fuga/.i's
members founded Dischord

Records. To this
date, the label
has released all
Fugazi albums,
charging a mere
$10 for CDs.
Oh, and if it

isn't already clear, they will
NOT sign to a major label, hav
ing already turned down more
than a few very lucrative offers,
fry explaining that to bands like
U2, Aerosmith, the Rolling
Stones or even Pearl Jam, whose
legal wrangling with Ticketmas
ter is put to shame by Fugazi, a
band that charges only five
bucks for shows.
More than 10 years have

equally influential "Repeater."
From the beginning, the band
has reiterated its dedication to
writing creative music that chal-

lenges its audience.
With a distinguished
discography of post
punk and hardcore al
liums, it continues
doing just that on the
full-length "The Argu-

merit" and three-song single
" Furniture."
The LP's title track appears
last on the CI), but is arguably its
brightest song. Musically, it
mixes lugazi's signature stutter
ing drums and harsh electric gui
tars with experimental elements
such as a dreamy sounding elec
tric keyboard and cello. The
lyrics take to task those who
would silence dissenting voices in
a civil society.
"Epic Problem," another ex
cellent song, is cleverly crafted

with amazing guitar work and vo
cals that subtly alternate between
crunching, angry aggression and
a tenderly delivered, yet com
manding chorus.
Also notable is the fifth track,
"Life and Limb." Employing a
guitar riff with slight echoes of the
late 70s punk band Television, it
questions how a nation can use vi
olence in defense of liberty and
compassion. A guest appearance
by former Bikini Kill bassist Kathi
Wilcox on vocals adds another
layer of depth to the track. Her
voice mingles with singer lan
MacKaye's to create ;i hazy, pen
sive sound.
"Furniture," a single which
does not appear on the LP, con
tains three songs. While they dif
fer greatly in character from the
songs on the album, they are still
worth a listen.
"Number 5," the second track,
is a hard, fast and raw hardcore

instrumental that made for quite
a bit ol fun when I cranked it up
in the car. Hie last song, "Hello
Morning," is reminiscent of the
band's older sound, driven pri
marily by lan Mac kaye's barking
vocals and screams.
With each of its members in his
30s, Fugazi is a dinosaur by punk
rock standards. Nonetheless,
they have avoided becoming to
the indie world what the Rolling
Stones are to mainstream rock: a
veritable nostalgia act that long
passed their prime.
Needless to say, this pair of re
leases will ensure that bandmates
Brendan Canty, Joe Lally, lan
MacKaye and Guy l'icciotto con
tinue to be taken very seriously by
fans, critics and musicians alike.
Reaffirming its relevance in a
changing musical world, Fugazi's
music continues to evolve in a wa\
that is refreshing, intelligent and,
dare one say, graceful.
