# Our Top Five Movies of 2001
## 
### 
Anthony Ha
1. "Ghost World" - A scathingly funny look at growing up in a cul
ture increasingly dominated by the bland and the phony. Not
quite as good as D;ui Clowes' graphic novel, but Thora Birch and
Steve Biiscerai kick ass, and Scarlett Johansson is super-hot.
2. "The Fellowship of the Ring" 1 his gorgeous film is like heaven
for my inner geek George Lucas must be wetting himself
1 with jealousy.
3. "Bvffy Hie Mtnkal" - It isn't, a movie, but how could I NOT men- |
t ion one of the best., most original episodes yet of the best show on
TV? Angst, vampires, Alyson Manuigan and imitation-Stephen
Sondheim yummy.
4. ''Moulin Rouge" - OK. so I have a weak spot for musicals. A daz
; /ling, hyperactive treat for hopeless romantics.
5. "Memento" A diabolically clever inversion of the standard pot
boiler formula. We already know what happens next, die mys
tery lies in what happened first Trippy.
JungLah
J. "lord of the Rings" - Not flawless, but part one of director Peter
Jackson's epic trilogy delivers on its Star Wars-esque hype. It unites
the Ix'st of Jackson's former work — the battle-aim action mayhem
of "Dead Alive" and the sweepingly sublime cinematography of
" Heavenly Creatures" — and proceeds to wow you with three hours
that are actually worth the nine bucks you paid to get in.
2. "Ghost World" Perfectly captures the bitingly sarcastic wit and
humor of the Daniel Clowes graphic novel. 1 hora Birch and Scar
lettJohansson play post-high school malcontents to a disaffected "T,"
and you know that whenever Steve Buscemi is cast ;is the creepy
loner, it's gonna lx* golden.
3. "In the Mood for Love" - Yet another Wong Kar-Wai masterpiece,
where his overt stylistic method is toned down while still maintaining
innovative editing techniques and a hyper-saturation of visual plea
sure. A truly polished film which illt istrates a meticulously paced and
keen eye for the subtleties of relationships.
4. "The Royal Tenenbaums" Writing team Wes Anderson and ()wen
Wilson out-Rushtnore "Rushmore" in this storybook tale ofa family
of geniuses. Part J. 1). Salinger, part ensemble acting brilliance, and
simultaneously so ridiculously funny and sad that it practically hurts
to watch and laugh.
5. "Amores Poms" A stunning piece of filmmaking from Mexican di
rector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who intersects the lives of a
young, middle-aged and old man through one single event with the
precision ofa short story writer and the narrative craft of a veteran
director. After viewing this film, you'll probably tell yourself, "Dog
fighting is totally flicked up."
SandeepGopalan
1. "Many Potter and the Soneror's Stone" - It bore the weight of ex
pectation brilliantly and for sheer fidelity to the text. Is unmatched.
The acting is supeib. As the $8(X) million dollarstbat it has earned
around the world proves; it is No. I.
l"MoufmRouge" Its what cinema is si ipposed to lx\ visual specta
cle that transports the viewer. It doesn't hurt that Nicole Kidman
l<x)ks ravishing.
3. "Memento" - Although Chr istopher Nolan disclaims any inspira
tion fiom 1 larold Pinter, this movie is as taut as Hater's best. Crazy
and kicking in structure.t he movie does not fail to leave an imprint
4. "A BeautiM Mind" Russell Crowe's acting frees madness from j
stereotyped loudness.
5. "lord of the Rings" I )espite Pctet Jackson's efforts the most await- j
ed movie of the decade is a visual treat.

Eric Hand
1. "Before Night Falls" Painter-turned-director Julian Schnabel
immerses you in the sweat, chaos and color of Cuba during the
mid 1960s — when tiie peaking sexual revolution coincided
with Castro's. Javier Bardem gives a tour-de-force perfor
mance as poet Reinaldo Arenas.
2. "Amores Perms" Sometimes called the Mexican Tarantino,
Inarritu uses dog-fighting to explore the always libidinous,
lethally competitive aspects of the male psyche. Sets a cleverly
disjunctured plot to a fimky-as-shit soundtrack in the sensual
ly overwhelming world of Mexico City.
3. "Ghost World" Oakland native Dan Clowes' graphic novel iso
lates the humor in the hopelessness of contemporary America.
And Terry Zwigoff's fairly faithful adaptation goes a long way
in replicating its artistry.
4. "Hedwig and the Angry Inth" I he "Rocky I Ion or Picture" for
the new millenium.
5. "Memento" 1 )eservedly self-assured of his cleverness, C Ihi isto
pher Nolan had people returning.to the theater (or reaching
for the pause button) to figure this one out.
RaminSetoodeh
1. "Moulin Rouge' What elevates "Moulin Rouge" to i
somewhere where great, movies belong is its flawless,
hyper-sensitive narrative technique— which slips into
song numbers with the relative ease of a virtuoso violinist.
2. "In the Bedroom" - Bcatifully-acted masterpiece that stars
Sissy Spacek and Torn Wilkinson as an aging New Eng
land couple. Begins with a summer romance between two
young lovers and ends with a suspensefi.il, splendid Hitch
cockian finale.
1 "Green's Ekven" Slick, no-nonsense heist flick that is so
well crafted, it breaks the boundaries of its genre. Director
Steven Soderbergh is responsible for some of the most
wonderful films of recent years ("Traffic," "Out of Sight,"
"Erin Brockovich"), but here he proves he can still have
fun while making a movie that belongs with the best of'em.
4. "The Royal Tenenbaums n - A laugh-out-loud farce that's
bold enough to drift into the dramatic waters without
turning soggy.
5. "Bridget Jones's Diary" - Ilie best book-to-film adaptation
of the year wasn't "Harry Potter and the Sort erer's Stone"
(too cute) or "Lord of the Rings" (too claustrophobic), but
this comic gem. based on the Helen Fielding novel of the
same name.
Nathan Lasche
1. "Shrek"- I luge breakthrough for 3-D animation. One of
the few movies ever to achieve a perfect balance of fart
humor for the kiddies and subtle phallic jokes for the
adults.
2. "A Beautiful Mind" Ron I loward proves that he can di
rect anything, and Russell Crowe is incredible as the tor
tured genius John Nash, taking a large step toward a sec
ond-consecutive Best Actor Oscar.
3. "Memento" - M ost surprising and intriguing movie of
the year.
4. "Lord of the Rings" - A movie worthy of its hyjie. Amazing re-cre
ation of Tolkien's world with breathtaking effects. Stays true to the
lxx)k and thus avoids thousands of rabid Tolkien's devotees tear
ing down the sound stages at New Line.
5. "Monsters, Int." - The Disney / Pixar team does it again.
Lovable characters, great humor and ingenious concept.

Kim Samek
1. "The Man Who Wasn't There" - Amazing film ex
ploring typical existential questions. Very much a
modern version of "The Stranger," yet playing
on ironies that arise from our perspective in
2001.
2. "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" Hilarious and po
etic. An amazing feat for the movie often dubbed
as the new " Rocky Horror." Touching and smart.
3."Amelie" - What, is there to be said about Amelie
that hasn't already been said?
4. "Waking Lite" - What if all of your life were just j
a dream as you were dying?
5. "Royal Tenenbaums" - Suffers a bit from under
development of plot and characters (how many
times does Ben Stiller's character really need to
whine about his dad?), but there's an interesting
quality to this movie.
Chris Lee
1. "lord of the Kings" Peter Jackson's mammoth under
taking of the Tolkien liilogy proves both epic and capti
vating. The kind of thing that makes you want to believe
in big i no vies ag"ain.
2. "Memento" A creative, stylish noir brilliantly plotted
and conceived, owing no small amount to Guy Pierce's
charismatic peifonnance.
1 'The Royal Tenenbaums" -Be >mnving heavily from cult
fave "Rushmore," Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson
prove again that their inimitable blend of humor and
pathos is a unique voice. Yeah, it's mainly a vehicle for
Gene Hackinan, but the big name cast and shades of
Salinger are added Ix muses.
4. "Monsters, Inc" - l'ixar proves they can do no wrong
with their latest animated feature — creative characters,
lush visuals, great voice-casting and a contagious charm
that outshines the year's earlier big animated film,
"Shrek."
5. "Vanilla Sky" -Okay,so I'm partial to(«imeron( irowe.
I lis latest partnership with Tom Cruise doesn't quite de
liver on everything it promises, but the ideas it plants
about the nature of life accompanied by the pop culture
tidbits and killer soundtrack are worth for more than the
average film. An admirable experiment, on par with
Spielberg's underappreciated "AI.
MarkRobbins
Christopher Nolan turns a clever premise !
into the most gripping suspense thrillers in years A
throbbing musical score ami Guy IVrces heartrending
vulnerability make it unforgettable.
Z "The Royal Tenenbaums" - Wes Anderson invites its into
his quirky world of detestable, transparent and hilarious
characters.
1 "InfaeBetkaom" Yom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacekare
flawless in a simple story crafted with patience and im
maculate precision. A peerless tale of murder and
demption.
4, "Zookmder" Ben Stiller's story of the brainwashed J
fashion mode! manages to Ix: both witless and amusing.
5I "lheluxhinDefente" -John Turtunocaptivatesasan et
c:entric chess genius in .in elegant film of romance and
madness.

the Ix'st of Jackson's former work — the battle-aim action mayhem
of "Dead Alive" and the sweepingly sublime cinematography of
" Heavenly Creatures" — and proceeds to wow you with three hours
that are actually worth the nine bucks you paid to get in.
2. "Ghost World" Perfectly captures the bitingly sarcastic wit and
humor of the Daniel Clowes graphic novel. 1 hora Birch and Scar
lettJohansson play post-high school malcontents to a disaffected "T,"
and you know that whenever Steve Buscemi is cast ;is the creepy
loner, it's gonna lx* golden.
3. "In the Mood for Love" - Yet another Wong Kar-Wai masterpiece,
where his overt stylistic method is toned down while still maintaining
innovative editing techniques and a hyper-saturation of visual plea
sure. A truly polished film which illt istrates a meticulously paced and
keen eye for the subtleties of relationships.
4. "The Royal Tenenbaums" Writing team Wes Anderson and ()wen
Wilson out-Rushtnore "Rushmore" in this storybook tale ofa family
of geniuses. Part J. 1). Salinger, part ensemble acting brilliance, and
simultaneously so ridiculously funny and sad that it practically hurts
to watch and laugh.
5. "Amores Poms" A stunning piece of filmmaking from Mexican di
rector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who intersects the lives of a
young, middle-aged and old man through one single event with the
precision ofa short story writer and the narrative craft of a veteran
director. After viewing this film, you'll probably tell yourself, "Dog
fighting is totally flicked up."

1. "Many Potter and the Soneror's Stone" - It bore the weight of ex
pectation brilliantly and for sheer fidelity to the text. Is unmatched.
The acting is supeib. As the $8(X) million dollarstbat it has earned
around the world proves; it is No. I.
l"MoufmRouge" Its what cinema is si ipposed to lx\ visual specta
cle that transports the viewer. It doesn't hurt that Nicole Kidman
l<x)ks ravishing.
3. "Memento" - Although Chr istopher Nolan disclaims any inspira
tion fiom 1 larold Pinter, this movie is as taut as Hater's best. Crazy
and kicking in structure.t he movie does not fail to leave an imprint
4. "A BeautiM Mind" Russell Crowe's acting frees madness from j
stereotyped loudness.
5. "lord of the Rings" I )espite Pctet Jackson's efforts the most await- j
ed movie of the decade is a visual treat.

Eric Hand
1. "Before Night Falls" Painter-turned-director Julian Schnabel
immerses you in the sweat, chaos and color of Cuba during the
mid 1960s — when tiie peaking sexual revolution coincided
with Castro's. Javier Bardem gives a tour-de-force perfor
mance as poet Reinaldo Arenas.
2. "Amores Perms" Sometimes called the Mexican Tarantino,
Inarritu uses dog-fighting to explore the always libidinous,
lethally competitive aspects of the male psyche. Sets a cleverly
disjunctured plot to a fimky-as-shit soundtrack in the sensual
ly overwhelming world of Mexico City.
3. "Ghost World" Oakland native Dan Clowes' graphic novel iso
lates the humor in the hopelessness of contemporary America.
And Terry Zwigoff's fairly faithful adaptation goes a long way
in replicating its artistry.
4. "Hedwig and the Angry Inth" I he "Rocky I Ion or Picture" for
the new millenium.
5. "Memento" 1 )eservedly self-assured of his cleverness, C Ihi isto
pher Nolan had people returning.to the theater (or reaching
for the pause button) to figure this one out.

1. "Moulin Rouge' What elevates "Moulin Rouge" to i
somewhere where great, movies belong is its flawless,
hyper-sensitive narrative technique— which slips into
song numbers with the relative ease of a virtuoso violinist.
2. "In the Bedroom" - Bcatifully-acted masterpiece that stars
Sissy Spacek and Torn Wilkinson as an aging New Eng
land couple. Begins with a summer romance between two
young lovers and ends with a suspensefi.il, splendid Hitch
cockian finale.
1 "Green's Ekven" Slick, no-nonsense heist flick that is so
well crafted, it breaks the boundaries of its genre. Director
Steven Soderbergh is responsible for some of the most
wonderful films of recent years ("Traffic," "Out of Sight,"
"Erin Brockovich"), but here he proves he can still have
fun while making a movie that belongs with the best of'em.
4. "The Royal Tenenbaums n - A laugh-out-loud farce that's
bold enough to drift into the dramatic waters without
turning soggy.
5. "Bridget Jones's Diary" - Ilie best book-to-film adaptation
of the year wasn't "Harry Potter and the Sort erer's Stone"
(too cute) or "Lord of the Rings" (too claustrophobic), but
this comic gem. based on the Helen Fielding novel of the
same name.
Nathan Lasche
1. "Shrek"- I luge breakthrough for 3-D animation. One of
the few movies ever to achieve a perfect balance of fart
humor for the kiddies and subtle phallic jokes for the
adults.
2. "A Beautiful Mind" Ron I loward proves that he can di
rect anything, and Russell Crowe is incredible as the tor
tured genius John Nash, taking a large step toward a sec
ond-consecutive Best Actor Oscar.
3. "Memento" - M ost surprising and intriguing movie of
the year.
4. "Lord of the Rings" - A movie worthy of its hyjie. Amazing re-cre
ation of Tolkien's world with breathtaking effects. Stays true to the
lxx)k and thus avoids thousands of rabid Tolkien's devotees tear
ing down the sound stages at New Line.
5. "Monsters, Int." - The Disney / Pixar team does it again.
Lovable characters, great humor and ingenious concept.

Kim Samek
1. "The Man Who Wasn't There" - Amazing film ex
ploring typical existential questions. Very much a
modern version of "The Stranger," yet playing
on ironies that arise from our perspective in
2001.
2. "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" Hilarious and po
etic. An amazing feat for the movie often dubbed
as the new " Rocky Horror." Touching and smart.
3."Amelie" - What, is there to be said about Amelie
that hasn't already been said?
4. "Waking Lite" - What if all of your life were just j
a dream as you were dying?
5. "Royal Tenenbaums" - Suffers a bit from under
development of plot and characters (how many
times does Ben Stiller's character really need to
whine about his dad?), but there's an interesting
quality to this movie.
Chris Lee
1. "lord of the Kings" Peter Jackson's mammoth under
taking of the Tolkien liilogy proves both epic and capti
vating. The kind of thing that makes you want to believe
in big i no vies ag"ain.
2. "Memento" A creative, stylish noir brilliantly plotted
and conceived, owing no small amount to Guy Pierce's
charismatic peifonnance.
1 'The Royal Tenenbaums" -Be >mnving heavily from cult
fave "Rushmore," Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson
prove again that their inimitable blend of humor and
pathos is a unique voice. Yeah, it's mainly a vehicle for
Gene Hackinan, but the big name cast and shades of
Salinger are added Ix muses.
4. "Monsters, Inc" - l'ixar proves they can do no wrong
with their latest animated feature — creative characters,
lush visuals, great voice-casting and a contagious charm
that outshines the year's earlier big animated film,
"Shrek."
5. "Vanilla Sky" -Okay,so I'm partial to(«imeron( irowe.
I lis latest partnership with Tom Cruise doesn't quite de
liver on everything it promises, but the ideas it plants
about the nature of life accompanied by the pop culture
tidbits and killer soundtrack are worth for more than the

Anthony Ha
1. "Ghost World" - A scathingly funny look at growing up in a cul
ture increasingly dominated by the bland and the phony. Not
quite as good as D;ui Clowes' graphic novel, but Thora Birch and
Steve Biiscerai kick ass, and Scarlett Johansson is super-hot.
2. "The Fellowship of the Ring" 1 his gorgeous film is like heaven
for my inner geek George Lucas must be wetting himself

3. "Bvffy Hie Mtnkal" - It isn't, a movie, but how could I NOT men- |

4. ''Moulin Rouge" - OK. so I have a weak spot for musicals. A daz

5. "Amores Poms" A stunning piece of filmmaking from Mexican di
rector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who intersects the lives of a
young, middle-aged and old man through one single event with the
precision ofa short story writer and the narrative craft of a veteran
director. After viewing this film, you'll probably tell yourself, "Dog
fighting is totally flicked up."

1. "Many Potter and the Soneror's Stone" - It bore the weight of ex
pectation brilliantly and for sheer fidelity to the text. Is unmatched.
The acting is supeib. As the $8(X) million dollarstbat it has earned
around the world proves; it is No. I.
l"MoufmRouge" Its what cinema is si ipposed to lx\ visual specta
cle that transports the viewer. It doesn't hurt that Nicole Kidman
l<x)ks ravishing.
3. "Memento" - Although Chr istopher Nolan disclaims any inspira
tion fiom 1 larold Pinter, this movie is as taut as Hater's best. Crazy
and kicking in structure.t he movie does not fail to leave an imprint
4. "A BeautiM Mind" Russell Crowe's acting frees madness from j
stereotyped loudness.
5. "lord of the Rings" I )espite Pctet Jackson's efforts the most await- j
ed movie of the decade is a visual treat.

Eric Hand
1. "Before Night Falls" Painter-turned-director Julian Schnabel
immerses you in the sweat, chaos and color of Cuba during the
mid 1960s — when tiie peaking sexual revolution coincided
with Castro's. Javier Bardem gives a tour-de-force perfor
mance as poet Reinaldo Arenas.
2. "Amores Perms" Sometimes called the Mexican Tarantino,
Inarritu uses dog-fighting to explore the always libidinous,
lethally competitive aspects of the male psyche. Sets a cleverly
disjunctured plot to a fimky-as-shit soundtrack in the sensual
ly overwhelming world of Mexico City.
3. "Ghost World" Oakland native Dan Clowes' graphic novel iso
lates the humor in the hopelessness of contemporary America.
And Terry Zwigoff's fairly faithful adaptation goes a long way
in replicating its artistry.
4. "Hedwig and the Angry Inth" I he "Rocky I Ion or Picture" for
the new millenium.
5. "Memento" 1 )eservedly self-assured of his cleverness, C Ihi isto
pher Nolan had people returning.to the theater (or reaching
for the pause button) to figure this one out.
RaminSetoodeh
1. "Moulin Rouge' What elevates "Moulin Rouge" to i
somewhere where great, movies belong is its flawless,
hyper-sensitive narrative technique— which slips into
song numbers with the relative ease of a virtuoso violinist.
2. "In the Bedroom" - Bcatifully-acted masterpiece that stars
Sissy Spacek and Torn Wilkinson as an aging New Eng
land couple. Begins with a summer romance between two
young lovers and ends with a suspensefi.il, splendid Hitch
cockian finale.
1 "Green's Ekven" Slick, no-nonsense heist flick that is so
well crafted, it breaks the boundaries of its genre. Director
Steven Soderbergh is responsible for some of the most
wonderful films of recent years ("Traffic," "Out of Sight,"
"Erin Brockovich"), but here he proves he can still have
fun while making a movie that belongs with the best of'em.
4. "The Royal Tenenbaums n - A laugh-out-loud farce that's
bold enough to drift into the dramatic waters without
turning soggy.
5. "Bridget Jones's Diary" - Ilie best book-to-film adaptation
of the year wasn't "Harry Potter and the Sort erer's Stone"
(too cute) or "Lord of the Rings" (too claustrophobic), but
this comic gem. based on the Helen Fielding novel of the
same name.
Nathan Lasche
1. "Shrek"- I luge breakthrough for 3-D animation. One of
the few movies ever to achieve a perfect balance of fart
humor for the kiddies and subtle phallic jokes for the
adults.
2. "A Beautiful Mind" Ron I loward proves that he can di
rect anything, and Russell Crowe is incredible as the tor
tured genius John Nash, taking a large step toward a sec
ond-consecutive Best Actor Oscar.
3. "Memento" - M ost surprising and intriguing movie of
the year.
4. "Lord of the Rings" - A movie worthy of its hyjie. Amazing re-cre
ation of Tolkien's world with breathtaking effects. Stays true to the
lxx)k and thus avoids thousands of rabid Tolkien's devotees tear
ing down the sound stages at New Line.
5. "Monsters, Int." - The Disney / Pixar team does it again.
Lovable characters, great humor and ingenious concept.

Kim Samek
1. "The Man Who Wasn't There" - Amazing film ex
ploring typical existential questions. Very much a
modern version of "The Stranger," yet playing
on ironies that arise from our perspective in
2001.
2. "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" Hilarious and po
etic. An amazing feat for the movie often dubbed
as the new " Rocky Horror." Touching and smart.
3."Amelie" - What, is there to be said about Amelie
that hasn't already been said?
4. "Waking Lite" - What if all of your life were just j
a dream as you were dying?
5. "Royal Tenenbaums" - Suffers a bit from under
development of plot and characters (how many
times does Ben Stiller's character really need to
whine about his dad?), but there's an interesting
quality to this movie.
Chris Lee
1. "lord of the Kings" Peter Jackson's mammoth under
taking of the Tolkien liilogy proves both epic and capti
vating. The kind of thing that makes you want to believe
in big i no vies ag"ain.
2. "Memento" A creative, stylish noir brilliantly plotted
and conceived, owing no small amount to Guy Pierce's
charismatic peifonnance.
1 'The Royal Tenenbaums" -Be >mnving heavily from cult
fave "Rushmore," Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson
prove again that their inimitable blend of humor and
pathos is a unique voice. Yeah, it's mainly a vehicle for
Gene Hackinan, but the big name cast and shades of
Salinger are added Ix muses.
4. "Monsters, Inc" - l'ixar proves they can do no wrong
with their latest animated feature — creative characters,
lush visuals, great voice-casting and a contagious charm
that outshines the year's earlier big animated film,
"Shrek."
5. "Vanilla Sky" -Okay,so I'm partial to(«imeron( irowe.
I lis latest partnership with Tom Cruise doesn't quite de
liver on everything it promises, but the ideas it plants
about the nature of life accompanied by the pop culture
tidbits and killer soundtrack are worth for more than the
average film. An admirable experiment, on par with
Spielberg's underappreciated "AI.
MarkRobbins
Christopher Nolan turns a clever premise !
into the most gripping suspense thrillers in years A
throbbing musical score ami Guy IVrces heartrending
vulnerability make it unforgettable.
Z "The Royal Tenenbaums" - Wes Anderson invites its into
his quirky world of detestable, transparent and hilarious
characters.
1 "InfaeBetkaom" Yom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacekare
flawless in a simple story crafted with patience and im
maculate precision. A peerless tale of murder and
demption.
4, "Zookmder" Ben Stiller's story of the brainwashed J
fashion mode! manages to Ix: both witless and amusing.
5I "lheluxhinDefente" -John Turtunocaptivatesasan et
c:entric chess genius in .in elegant film of romance and
madness.
Anthony Ha
1. "Ghost World" - A scathingly funny look at growing up in a cul
ture increasingly dominated by the bland and the phony. Not
quite as good as D;ui Clowes' graphic novel, but Thora Birch and
Steve Biiscerai kick ass, and Scarlett Johansson is super-hot.
2. "The Fellowship of the Ring" 1 his gorgeous film is like heaven
for my inner geek George Lucas must be wetting himself
1 with jealousy.
3. "Bvffy Hie Mtnkal" - It isn't, a movie, but how could I NOT men- |
t ion one of the best., most original episodes yet of the best show on
TV? Angst, vampires, Alyson Manuigan and imitation-Stephen
Sondheim yummy.
4. ''Moulin Rouge" - OK. so I have a weak spot for musicals. A daz
; /ling, hyperactive treat for hopeless romantics.
5. "Memento" A diabolically clever inversion of the standard pot
boiler formula. We already know what happens next, die mys
tery lies in what happened first Trippy.
JungLah
J. "lord of the Rings" - Not flawless, but part one of director Peter
Jackson's epic trilogy delivers on its Star Wars-esque hype. It unites
the Ix'st of Jackson's former work — the battle-aim action mayhem
of "Dead Alive" and the sweepingly sublime cinematography of
" Heavenly Creatures" — and proceeds to wow you with three hours
that are actually worth the nine bucks you paid to get in.
2. "Ghost World" Perfectly captures the bitingly sarcastic wit and
humor of the Daniel Clowes graphic novel. 1 hora Birch and Scar
lettJohansson play post-high school malcontents to a disaffected "T,"
and you know that whenever Steve Buscemi is cast ;is the creepy
loner, it's gonna lx* golden.
3. "In the Mood for Love" - Yet another Wong Kar-Wai masterpiece,
where his overt stylistic method is toned down while still maintaining
innovative editing techniques and a hyper-saturation of visual plea
sure. A truly polished film which illt istrates a meticulously paced and
keen eye for the subtleties of relationships.
4. "The Royal Tenenbaums" Writing team Wes Anderson and ()wen
Wilson out-Rushtnore "Rushmore" in this storybook tale ofa family
of geniuses. Part J. 1). Salinger, part ensemble acting brilliance, and
simultaneously so ridiculously funny and sad that it practically hurts
to watch and laugh.
