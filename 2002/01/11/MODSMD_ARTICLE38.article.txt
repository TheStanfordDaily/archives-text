# Smith fat; 'Ali' thin

### MARK ROBBINS 
Director Michael Mann's at
tenipt to stufl the unwieldy epic of
the indomitable Muhammed Ali
into a feature length film is gutsy,
loo bad he ended up pulling his
punches. Mann ("The Insider",
"Heat") chronicles a 10-year seg
ment in the career of boxing's
greatest champion and sports his
tory's all-time trash talker. Without
a bold vision. "Ali" is derailed by an
overload of material, squandering
away dazzling potential.
Mann and cinematographer
Knunanuel Lubezki consider "what
fictional 'Ali' can offer that docu
mentary Ali can't." In the ring the
answer is relatively simple: George
Foreman belting us against the
ropes. Outside the ring, Mann and

Lube/.ki search for
never-before-seen per
spectives on the champ,
using unorthodox cam
era angles, whipping
camera pans and a pre
occupation with small

detail. These techniques make for
riveting fight scenes, but they dis
tort the narrative. The film suffers
through a series of long, disjointed

shots. Ali's marriages and relation
ships are left undeveloped, and sig
nificant subplots like the role of the
FBI are only buried allusions.
While Mann is of! floating like a
butterfly, his cast is turning in solid
performances. The normally slen
der Will Smith packed on some 30
legitimate pounds to be Ali. At
times lie looks eerily like the
champ, though he still lacks the
neck for the part. Smith lias the
bravado and witticisms down pat,
but his rendition is lame compared
to the powder keg of vitality that
once stirred a generation.
Smith is competent on the can
vas as well, recreating Ali's stance
and mannerisms admirably, (last
ing smaller opponents, though,
would have done wonders for his
torical accuracy. Andrew Toney,

who plays Joe
Frazier, dwarfs
Smith in the
ring when, in
fact, Ali was the
larger fighter.
When Ali faces

George Foreman (Charles Shuf
ford), he appears to be dancing
around a Ford Excursion.
Jon Voight nails ABC anchor

man Howard Cosell with an under
slated and compassionate portray
al. His rifling dialogue and rapport
with Smith provide some of the
film's best moments. Jamie Foxx,
who plays Ali's patchy-headed,
rhyming corner man Drew 'Bundi
ni' Brown, might have stolen the
show if allotted more camera time.
Good acting, though, can't mask


Call me "Fresh Prince." I dare you
