# 'Mind' lacks beauty
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Ah, (Christmas. That special time
ol year when movie studios take a
momentary break from blowing
shit up and telling semen jokes to
roll out their uplifting celebrations
of family values — i.e. Oscar bail.
Case in point is "A Beautiful Mind,"
a film loosely based on the life of
mathematician John Nash.
I he irony of the movie, howev
er, is i hat a story concerned with the
relationship between genius and
madness is so ultimately lacking in
either. There are no creative risks,
no flashes of cinematic brilliance.
Instead, "A Beautiful Mind" simply
plods along in its competent, but
entirely predictable and unin
spired, way.
It didn't have to be like this.
Sylvia Nasar's award-winning bi
ography of Nash is a deeply mov
ing portrait of a complex man,
whose work in game theory —
only one of the many fields he con
tributed to — eventually won him
the Nobel prize. He also spent
much of his life trapped in a men
tal prison of schizophrenia.ln the
right hands, Nash's life might have
become a genuinely touching film.
I he main culprit behind the
transformation of Nasar's biogra
phy into the usual pabulum is
screenwriter Akiva Goldsman.
Granted, "A Beautiful Mind"
doesn't sink to the depths of some

oft ioldsman's other crimes against
the cinema, including "Batman
and Robin" and "Lost in Space,"
but he still bears the blame lor strip-

ping the complexity from Nash's
life and forcing it into the strait jaek
et of the true-love-eonquers-all for
mula.
Generally, playing around a lit
tle with the facts is forgivable when
a film has to compress an entire life
into two hours, but "A Beautiful
Mind" pushes it. Gone are Nash's
dabblings in homosexuality, the
child he bore out of wedlock, the
fact that his wife left him for several
years and his younger son's own
battle with schizophrenia. Golds
man distorts the nature of Nash's
hallucinations, and never effective
ly conveys his isolation from the rest
of the world when in the depths of
his insanity. The story we're left
with only resembles Nash's life in its
broadest outlines.
In place of such prickly details,
the film substitutes vague charac
terization and feel-good platitudes
like "Nothing's ever for sure, John,
is the Only sure thing I do know,"
and"It is only in the mysterious

equations of love that any loj»i<- can
be found." While the dialogue
rarely gets quite that had, the pre
dictable and perfunctory style of
the whole thing just makes the film
feel unbelievably bland.
Not helping matters are director
Ron Howard or composer |ames
Horner. With a better script,
Howard's unobtrusive direction
might be forgivable or even prefer
able, but as the movie stands, Liis re
liance on familiar imagery only em
phasizes the blandness.
I forner's annoying score, on the
other hand, underlines every single
emotion with tiresome bombast.
When the music swells at the end
for Nash's Nobel acceptance
speech, you want to scream,
"Enough already!"
AH of this is a particular shame
because the cast generally does
good work with the material that
they're given. As Nash's wife Alicia,
Jennifer Connelly is only allowed
— apart from an obligatory scene
of Big Acting — to gaze lovingly at
her husband and look hot, but she
does both quite well.
Even better is Russell Crowe,
who portrays Nash with genuine
complexity and pathos. But his ef
fectiveness is severely hampered by
the predictability of (ioldsman's
script. Crowe can only do so much,
since every time he opens his
mouth, we already know what he's
going to say.
