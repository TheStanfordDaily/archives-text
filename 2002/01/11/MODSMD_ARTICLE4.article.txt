This afternoon, the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Celebration Committee will
kick off a two-week program called
"Just Plain Folks: A Celebration of Un
sung I leroes."
During the coming days, members
of the Stanford community will join for
a variety of lectures, discussions and
special events, including an exhibit of
work by the New York-area photogra
pher Herbert Randall entitled "Facesof
Freedom Summer" and a panel discus
sion by former Black Student Union
members and administrators who were
at Stanford in 1968, the year that King
was assassinated.
The program will begin today at
noon at the Bookstore with a lecture by
author Lorraine Johnson-Coleman,
whose book "Just Plain Folks" inspired
the title for the celebration and contains
stories about the "ordinary, sensible
and awe-inspiring" experiences of
black people.
Speakers at past events have includ
ed such notable figures as Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright August Wil

daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr.

the "unsung heroes" that Johnson-
Coleman mentions.
Jan Barker-Alexander, director of

and chair of the celebration committee,
said she hopes that this year's events
will draw attention to tin* accomplish
ments of those people.
"Obviously we'll be talking about
King, but we'll also be talking about the
people who didn't make the history
books," Alexander said. "Those were
the people doing a lot of the work, and
we're really trying to focus on [the un
recognized]."
Johnson-Coleman said she agrees
about the importance of this goal.
"1 would like to bring attention to
the extraordinary accomplishments of
ordinary black folks," she said. "I would
like to bring dignity and grace to the
faceless heroes that brought so much to
black history."
Johnson-Coleman pointed out the
importance of expanding our under
standing of the civil right s movement to
include more than the 12 people at its
center who tend to occupy history books.
"We have to remember that Martin

strongly that justice could prevail,"
she said.
Another goal of the celebration is to
