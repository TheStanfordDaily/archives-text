This afternoon, the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Celebration Committee will
kick off a two-week program called
"Just Plain Folks: A Celebration of Un
sung I leroes."
During the coming days, members
of the Stanford community will join for
a variety of lectures, discussions and
special events, including an exhibit of
work by the New York-area photogra
pher Herbert Randall entitled "Facesof
Freedom Summer" and a panel discus
sion by former Black Student Union
members and administrators who were
at Stanford in 1968, the year that King
was assassinated.
The program will begin today at
noon at the Bookstore with a lecture by
author Lorraine Johnson-Coleman,
whose book "Just Plain Folks" inspired
the title for the celebration and contains
stories about the "ordinary, sensible
and awe-inspiring" experiences of
black people.
Speakers at past events have includ
ed such notable figures as Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright August Wil
son and Bernice King, the youngest

daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr.
This year, however, the focus will be on
the "unsung heroes" that Johnson-
Coleman mentions.
Jan Barker-Alexander, director of
(he Black Community Services Center
and chair of the celebration committee,
said she hopes that this year's events
will draw attention to tin* accomplish
ments of those people.
"Obviously we'll be talking about
King, but we'll also be talking about the
people who didn't make the history
books," Alexander said. "Those were
the people doing a lot of the work, and
we're really trying to focus on [the un
recognized]."
Johnson-Coleman said she agrees
about the importance of this goal.
"1 would like to bring attention to
the extraordinary accomplishments of
ordinary black folks," she said. "I would
like to bring dignity and grace to the
faceless heroes that brought so much to
black history."
Johnson-Coleman pointed out the
importance of expanding our under
standing of the civil right s movement to
include more than the 12 people at its
center who tend to occupy history books.
"We have to remember that Martin

Luther King came out of a communi
ty of African-Americans who believed
strongly that justice could prevail,"
she said.
Another goal of the celebration is to
encourage the Stanford community to
engage Dr. King's message through
various organized volunteer activities.

weekend, a time when many campus
dorms and houses organize ski trips to
Lake Tahoe, several Stanford commu
nity members will participate in Alter
native Ski Trip, during which they will
provide community service at East Palo
Alto High, Habitat For Humanity and
Lytton Gardens Retirement Cen
ter, among other locations.
"By doing community service,
In not only helping the Stanford
community hut also the surround
ing community, we're carrying
out King's message," said junior
Anna Otieno.
Alexander said the most moving
part ot the celebration may be the
panel discussion featuring speak
ers who were at Stanford at the

peak of the civil rights movement.
"In working with college stu
dents, it is evident that [the civil
rights movement] has become a
romantic movement that is far re
moved from their lives," Alexan
der said. "We hope that by focus
ing on the Farm, students will be
able to make direct connections to
the possibility of large-scale social
change."
The events of the next few
weeks will vary in size, from small
group discussions to large public
events like the panel discussion,
the photography exhibit and
Johnson-Coleman's lecture.

"What is key about this particu
lar program is that we're address
ing a wide range of issues and hav
ing a wide range of events," said ju
nior Jasmine Johnson.
"We're addressing it in a very
broad way, but 1 don't think we'll
lose any of the depth because each
of these events will be very impor
tant experiences for the Stanford
community," she said.
In addition to the scheduled
events, there will also be an essay
contest for high school and under
graduate students, co-sponsored
by the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity,
to which King belonged.
