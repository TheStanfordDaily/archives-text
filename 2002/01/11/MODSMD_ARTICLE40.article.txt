### SANDEEP GOPALAN 
Lord of the Rings:
The Fellowship of
the Ring M /VW
Dir. Peter Jackson —L-Jr*
New Line Cinema

It would be trite of rne to
say that this is a must-see
movie. Instead of stating the
obvious, I shall confine my
review to whining about the
shortcomings in Peter Jack
son's cinematic adaptation of
Tolkien's masterpiece. While

Jackson is entitled to some artistic license, considering the sheer scale
of the work, his omission of Tom Boinbadil is hard to comprehend.
Bombadil was introduced into the lx>ok as an enigmatic character
who did not have much importance in the narrative, but whose sym
bolic significance was paramount: abjuration of power. Bombadil is
completely unaffected by the ring, does not become invisible when he
wears it and is also able to see Frodo when the latter wears it. His dis
dain for power and non-interference with other beings convey a pow
erful lesson. Bombadil is surely an enigma—scholars have debated at
length as to whether he is a nature spirit, a Vala or a Maia. There can,
however, be no dispute abut his message.
Some critics have commented on the sumptuous treatment of the
Shire at the expense of Bree and Weathertop. I beg to differ. The
Shire does receive attention and deservedly so. 11 occupies a significant
part of tiie lx>ok and is the only opportunity to delineate upon the
character of the Hobbits. Their love of food and merrymaking can
only be captured by a full portrayal of life in the Shire. Although Jack
son spends some time on the Shire, his version is ridiculously spic and
span. It is hard to conceive that I lobbits would have maintained their
surroundings in quite the immaculate fashion shown in the film. It was
meant to be grubby and well worn, but instead we see a creation so
new that the polish glistens!
I he acting, barring a few exceptions, is of a high caliber. Elijah
Wood as Frodo strikes just the right note. Wood was so desperate to
get the role that he went into the woods accompanied by a friend with
a camera and sent the tape to Jackson, who was impressed enough to
offer him the role. Lan McKellen as (land,ill and Viggo Mortensen as
Aragorn are suitably powerful. Mortensen's Celtic and Scandinavian
background no doubt helped infuse the primal strength that he
brings to his portrayal of Aragorn. Lan I John as Bilbo and Sean Astin
as Sam (iamgee are nothing short of disasters. They can't act to save
their lives and murder their c haracters. Dominic Monaghan and Billy
Boyd as Merry and Pippin, on the other hand, are brilliantly true
I lobbits. Christopher Lee is terrific as the dark Saruman. Of'the only
two female characters, Liv Tyler as Arwen is unremarkable, despite
the extended horse c hase that Jackson gave her. Cate Blanc hett as
Caladriel is intensely intriguing. Her pointed ears and mysterious
looks bring Caladriel to life, especially in her epiphany before Frodo
where she visualizes herself as the bearer of the ()ne Ring.
It is unlikely that Tolkien would have thought much of Jackson's
interpretation of his work. The movie seems to have crossed the Ru
bicon that separates science fiction from fantasy and has sacrificed
imagination for technical wizardry. Yet one should see it for its sheer
grandeur. Carry a large bag of popcorn and settle into your seats for
a three hour-long visual treat.


Ringin' in the new year
