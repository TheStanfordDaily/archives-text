# Zero 7 anything but 'simple'
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
First tiling's first: Zero 7 (a.k.a. Sam Hardaker and
Henry Binns) are producers. This means other people
play much of the music / instruments on their debut album
"Simple Things." I'm not sure how much 1 like the idea of

producers releasing albums. Then again, what defines an artist anyway?
Britney Spears doesn't write most of her material, doesn't play instru
ments, she just sings (that is. when she's not lip-synching). Aren't het
producers more responsible for the final product than she is? A pro
ducer can often be more of an artist than a performer, and this puts Zero
7 back squarely in the game. They are undeniably and obviously the cre
ative force behind their record.
And what a tine record these two London blokes have created. They
clearly take their inspiration from a variety of sources: house, jazz, clas
sical, hip hop and good old fashioned 60s soul. C)ne hears elements of
Quincy Jones, I'hievery Corporation, Air, Radiohead and John Berry
side-by-side. I his "mellow techno," a somewhat misleading term be
cause the music is so soulful, is relaxing, inspiring, diverse and eclectic
and immensely enjoyable.
Zero 7 started out as remixers working for Nigel Crfxxlrich, who pro
duced Radiohead's "OK (lomputer." Fhey have done remixes lor Radio
head and Lenny Kravitz, as well as a number of cutting-edge British
groups. For their own album, where they compose 11 of the 14 songs and
produce all of them, they use some not-too-familiar (and very fine) talents
to help bring their music to life. Prominently featured are excellent vocal-

ists Mozez, Sia Furler and Sophie Barker.
I'he album kicks off impressively with "1 I lave Seen," a
mysterious blend of layered strings, waiting synthesizers,
hypnotic beats and Mozez's inflective vocals. The string
arrangements throughout the album are impressive, as is
the overall attention to detail. It is amazing how unsimple

"Simple Tilings" truly is, while managing to sound so easy. This is epito
mized on "Destiny," which features a soulful instrumental arrangement
behind Purler and Barker's effortless sounding washes of beautiful vocals.
Equally impressive is how eclectic "Simple "filings" is as a whole. The in
strumentals"()ut of Town" and "End Theme" sound like scores to James
Bond-type thrillers, while Mozez's falsetto vocal delivery on "1 his World"
helps to lend it a Maxwell-like neo soul feel. "Likufanele" liises orchestral
gold with the Afric an gospel choir Philani Mothers, while still being driven
by one of (he undeniably infectious mellow beats that pertneate through
out the album.
"Simple filings" has already been compared to Moby's "Play" as po
tentially the next underground album to unexpectedly hit it big. While
"Simple Things" is not quite as musically diverse as "Play," the album is su
perior in its coherence as a whole. On the "mellow techno" spectrum, 1
would suggest this: take out whatever CD you have between Delirium's
"Karma" and Thievery Corporation's "Mirroi Conspiracy" in your CD
changer and insert "Simple Things." Those three records together will
provide you with an increasingly mellow three-plus hours of chill-down
music. But Tin willing to bet that the middle hour is the one you'll enjoy
most. As artists, these producers are superb.
