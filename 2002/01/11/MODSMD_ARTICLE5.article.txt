# Annual dorm snow trips mean bonding, partying
##

What do mountains, snow and people sleeping in
closets have to do with Stanford? Nothing, until
hundreds of its students put studying on hold and
travel to Lake Tahoe fora weekend of skiing, close
quarters and some good old-fashioned debauchery.
Over the next several weekends, many Stanford
students will participate in their dorm, house or
student groups' "snow trip," a highly-anticipated
winter quarter activity that has become an annual
Stanford tradition.
For many dorms, the snow trip is the largest
event of the winter quarter and a perennial high
light for residents.
"Personally speaking, I love it," said Otero Resi
dent Assistant Emily Dressel, adding that around '.)()
percent of Otero residents were participating in the
snow trip. "The residents have been looking for
ward to it all quarter since they found out."
However, scheduling conflicts for many athletes
and a cappella group members often keep many
students from participating in the trips. Financial
concerns are also a substantial obstacle for some
students, who cited (he high cost of skiing as a bar
rier for attending.
Furthermore, for many students the snow trip
tends to be characterized more by alcohol than by
snow. While many, drinkers and nondrinkers

The annual dorm snow trip has become a favorite tradition among some students. However, others criticize it because
of the trip's expensive costs and alcohol-based night life.
alike, said the snow trip is oik* of
their favorite Stanford memo
ries, other students disagreed,
claiming that they were unable
to escape the drinking.
This has caused RAs and oth
ers who plan the snow trips to ex
plore ways of accommodating
students with disparate expecta
tions for the trip.
Most dorms have planned
their trips for the Martin Luther
King, Jr. long weekend.
Serra RA Anna MacPherson,
who estimated that 60 of Sena's
90 residents were participating,
said enthusiasm about the snow
trip is present among all classes.
"It's a good mid-year bonding
experience for everyone in the
house and a good time," she said.
With so many students going
on the snow trips, those who can't
go are forced to miss out on the
experience.
"1 have a responsibility to win
ter one-acts," said freshman
James 1 luff man. "I really wanted
to go with the people I'm already
good friends with. It sucks."
Branner RA Vamsi Adusumil-
H, who said that 50 of Branner's
175 residents are staying behind,
noted that they have set aside
some funds for students who
can't go.
"We'll try to have something to
do," he said. "Maybe cookies and
a movie in the lounge, or some
thing like that."
Almost all of the RAs also ex
pressed that they did not want fi
nances to be something that ex
cluded any residents.
"Just from the beginning
that's been a really big concern
because it can be kind of exclu
sive because skiing is expensive,"
MacPherson said. "We definitely
have funds worked into our bud
gets for issues like that."
Some dorms, such as Serra,

are charging as little as $5 per
resident to attend. Others, like
Otero and Freshman / Sopho
more College, are charging $35
or $40 per resident. These prices
do not include ski rental or lift
tickets, if students choose to ski.
However, several students
said they were either uncomfort
able approaching the RAs for
money or did not want to go if
they could not ski.
"It's something I'd like to do
once, but it's just not something I
have the money for," said sopho
more Mandi Alexander, who is
not going on a snow trip.
Another distinctive charac
teristic of the snow trip is the
opportunity to party, often for
the first time off-campus, with
dorm mates.
"All you do is basically drink
and lay around and go out and
play in the snow," said sopho
more Christina Mercado, who
said she loveel her freshman year
snow trip. "I don't really know
that you go because of the snow."
The reputation of the snow
trip as a time for partying has ex
tended to freshman.
"Lots of alcohol and cabins in
the mountains. Can it get any bet
ter?" said freshman Joseph
Chaudry.
Many students said they see
the snow trip and drinking as
going hand-in-hand. However,
because 50 or more students
often live in one house, the in
tense party atmosphere can
marginalize some students who
want a calmer environment.
"I think that for nondrinkers it
can be uncomfortable," said
sophomore Erin Archerd. "It can
be unnerving for the first time."
Because of this, many RAs
have decided to rent multiple
houses to accommodate t heir res
idents.
"This year we have five houses
so that all different types of peo
ple can go and have fun," said
Freshman / Sophomore College
RA Casey Bra/eal.
