# Study calls Stanford 'unaffordable'
## 
### ANTHONY HA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent nonprofit foundation report
claimed that many public and private uni
versities — including Stanford — remain
inaccessible to most low-income students.
The report by the Lumina Founda
tion categorized Stanford as "inadmissi
ble," as well as "unaffbrdable" for inde
pendent and dependent students of low
or median-level income. Other presti
gious institutions, such as Harvard and
UC-Berkeley, received the same ratings.
The foundation rates universities
using two criteria: whether students can
attend without making severe financial
sacrifices (affordability) and whether the
university admits students whose test
scores and grades place them in the 25th
to 75th percentiles of college-bound stu
dents (admissibility).
"The combination of federal, state and
institutional grant aid is often insufficient
to close the si/able affordability gap, par
ticularly for low-income students." said
Jerry Davis, vice president for research at
Lumina Foundation, in a press release.
"Even with continued improvements

in financial aid and an increased cost-con
tainment focus by colleges, needy stu
dents still struggle to afford a post-sec
ondary education," he added.
Robin Mamlet, Stanford's dean of un
dergraduate admissions and financial
aid, disagreed with the report and de
fended Stanford's financial aid policy.
"I believe that Stanford makes it possi
ble for students from all income ranges to
come," she said. "It is worth noting that
our financial aid packages are in fact most
favorable for low-income students.
[They] are packaged with the lowest
amount of self-help (job and loan) of all
our students, and our commitment is to
ensuring that this remains the case."
Mamlet pointed out that Stanford is
need-blind, and that this year's fresh
man ( lass is the most diverse in the Uni
versity's history.
Director of Student Awards and Fi
nancial Aid Cynthia Hartley noted that
42 percent of undergraduates receive fi
nancial aid from Stanford because the
University found that their family was
unable to meet the full costs of a Stanford
education.
112 lartley adder! that Stanford doled out

roughly $70 million in s< liolarships and
grants for the 2000-01 school year.
David L. Warren, president of the Na
tional Association of Independent Col
leges and Universities, issued a written
response to the report. Me claimed that
the report is inaccurate, largely because
by looking only at average financial aid
grants it underestimates the amount of
aid that truly needy students receive.
Mamlet did note, however, that acces
sibility may Ik' a problem at other univer
sities and for less accomplished students.
"I believe that college is more accessi
ble than ever to exceptionally strong low
to median-income students," she said.
"In other words, institutions such as Stan
ford, I larval d, Yale and Princeton are
putting unprecedented amounts of re
sources into financial aid. I do suspect
that less well-endowed institutions are far
less accessible, however.
Princeton is one university that has, in
recent years, made major efforts to ease
the financial burden on needy students,
