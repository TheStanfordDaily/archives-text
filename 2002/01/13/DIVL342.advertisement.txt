Squonk Opera's Inferno
January 17, 2003 at 8:00 pm
Memorial Auditorium, Stanford University
Dante's classic gets a wicked facelift in Squonk Opera's Inferno. Live rock music, digital
video, and massive otherworldly puppets combine in this off-beat tale of Centralia,
Pennsylvania, a real coal mine that caught fire in the 1960s and still burns today. This
modern spectacle is visually mesmerizing, socially relevant, and wildly original.
