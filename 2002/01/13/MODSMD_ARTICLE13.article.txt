## The 						Stanford Daily Stem-cell research puts Stanford at forefront 
### 
When the University announced it
would create the Institute for Can
cer / Stem Cell Biology and
Medicine last month, the chairman of Presi
dent Bush's Council on Bioethics argued that
Stanford was starting an institute that would
support "cloning" without "public scrutiny
and deliberation."
But the criticisms don't make sense — in
fact, Stanford is doing exactly what is re
quired of a top-notch research institution:
cautiously investigating technologies that
could help millions of people.
The institute's research revolves around
stem cells, which, according to NIH scien
tists, will help illuminate the basis for treat
ing Parkinson's, diabetes, multiple sclerosis
and heart disease.
Each of us likely knows someone who
would benefit from new treatments and
cures, and, because Stanford has access to
some of the best scientists in the world, it
would be foolish not to pursue this line of
research.
As soon as the announcement came out,
many people panicked, in part because the
language of the University's announcement
stated that researchers would use a process
called "cloning."
While the process by which the Stanford
scientists would duplicate embryos for stem
cell research does involve making replica
tions, the scientifically recognized term is
"nuclear transplantation."
With the Raelians' recent claim of cloning
a human baby, it's easy to see why many peo
ple believe that Stanford could be embarking
on a dangerous journey.
Fortunately, the University has reas
sured the public numerous times that the
Institute "will use many types of tissue, but
[the tissues] cannot on their own develop
into a human."
But with the addition of new research pos
sibilities, Stanford must also uphold its re
sponsibility to both the scientific community
and the community at large.
The University's researchers should make
public their findings so scientists everywhere
can build upon and improve the existing
knowledge pool.
We also urge the dean and staff of the
Medical School to strengthen their ethics
guidelines and to consider carefully all of
the implications of their research decisions.
Because Stanford just received the funds to
start a $120 million center, there is clearly
ample time for the University to consult
both ethical and scientific experts to ensure
accountability.
Finally, the University's announcement
should bring enormous benefits to the cal
iber of research here.
Stanford can attract even more scientists
who want to work without the govern
ment's current constraints on stem-cell
research.
Because the center will be the first insti
tute of its kind, Stanford will continue to
stay on the cutting edge of biotechnology.
In addition, the University will get an op
portunity to collaborate with scientists
from UCSF and other Bay Area labs on
this project.
We support Stanford's announcement to
pursue stem-cell research because it demon
strates the University's strong commitment
to academic freedom, despite the Bush ad
minstration's attempts to limit this potential
ly lifesaving research.

21 AND STILL CLUELESS
There are no happy endings
A wise woman once told me that, to
achieve inner peace, you must finish
what you have started. If only it
were that easy.
My favorite part of the beginning of
the quarter is going to the used book
store on Castro Street in Mountain View
and hunting around for books for my
classes. Part of its appeal is the sneaky
sensation that I'm screwing over eFollett
(take that, Stanford Bookstore!), but the
real thrill comes from just being around
all those books. You know, that tingly
feeling you got as a kid when your par
ents took you to the public library. That
thing.
My least favorite part of the beginning
of the quarter is taking
home my stack of new
used books and trying to
fit them all on these Stan
ford Housing-issued
shelves. I find them aes
thetically displeasing, for
one thing, and much too
small. One year, I lived in
Stern and just about the
only redeeming thing about that living sit
uation was the stack of built-in book
shelves on the wall above my desk. Hee
hee, decorating goodness.
The point of this story is, I consistently
end up buying more books than I'll ever
be able to finish reading. So I end up with
all these shelves full of pretty paperbacks.
You know when you walk into someone's
room, and they have shelves and shelves of
books, and some snarky person always
asks, "Wow, have you read all these?" I'm
one of the people who hasn't. Yes, I am a
big poser. Kill me now.
It's just that I get so excited about the
things I want to learn and the things I
want to do that I forget that I am human,
and also that I have a tendency to fall
asleep when reading. Mercy me, if I had a
nickel for every time I've crawled into bed
with a book in hand and fallen asleep less
than two pages in. ..
I don't think I'm alone in saying that I
almost never read every single page of
reading assigned fora class. It's part lazi
ness and part poor time management — if
something's going to fall by the wayside,
I'd quite frankly have it be the lesser works
of Nietzsche than time spent with my
friends. Hmm, better make that all the
works of Nietzsche.
So I happen to own quite a few books
that I've never finished reading. This lack
of follow-through on my part unfortu
nately extends to other parts of my life as
well. I have a lot of unfinished business.
The graduate school applications sitting
on my desk. Christmas cards that never
got written. A certain Incomplete that's
been mucking up my transcript.
Again, I don't think I'm alone here in
being one of those Stanford students who
feels pressured into juggling five or six dif
ferent projects at a time. It's just so excit
ing, the beginning of the quarter, or real
ly the beginning of anything — I just want
to have it all.
But as I have been in the process of
discovering, I can't. Have it all, that is. At
least not all at the same time., I'm one of
those people with low attention spans
who'll be in the middle of boiling water
for pasta, walk away to get a drink, get
distracted by the flower arrangements in
the dining room and decide to drive to
Safeway for new carnations while the
water boils over. No talent for multitask
ing here.
So when I was told that inner peace is
achieved by finishing what you've start
ed, I was like, "No kidding." Unfinished
business is the story of my life. I started
reorganizing my universe in my head
and made all sorts of promises to myself,
like, "I will set aside two hours per day
just for reading," and"I will get a filing
system for my Christmas cards and such
so I'll get caught up on my correspon
dence." Stuff like that, on up to "I will de
vise and implement an evil-genius plan to
end world hunger while simultaneously
becoming filthy rich."
But once you've got it all figured out,
when you've shaped the world into the
way you want it, what next? It's the same
sort of thing that happens after the"The
End" of a well-written story. What hap
pened after the end? After the bad guy
was defeated, did more bad guys rise up
or was the kingdom safe and boring for
ever after?
What would it be like to have finished
everything you ever wanted to do? To
have nothing more on your plate; to have
completed your life's work? What is it like
to have the best thing you'll ever accom
plish in life behind you?
I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person
to say that the natural state of human af
fairs is not inertia, but constant struggle. I
think it was Nietzsche who wrote that
(argh, just can't escape his bunk ass.) And
to me, that makes a lot of sense. I've
learned enough about myself to know that
I'm a creature of routine — 1 function best
when I have something to wake up to
every day. But I feel that life would be
empty if it was the exact same thing, day
after day.
Life is fuller somehow when you
have something to fight for, or to fight
against. The exciting part for us twen
ty-somethings is figuring out what
we're fighting for. We are learning
each day how to choose our battles, and
choose them wisely.
Perhaps if I were older, I'd be better
served by searching for inner peace, by
looking back on my life and evaluating
what I have already accomplished. But
I'm young enough, I think, that it's okay
for me to be more excited now about the
books I have yet to read than the books I
have read. To be looking forward to the
things I will do rather than the things that

Letters to the Editor
Alumna urges students to join Teach
for America
My name is Beth Berselli, and I gradu
ated from Stanford in 1997. I'm currently
teaching fifth grade in Phoenix as a Teach
For America corps member. I know there
are many Stanford students who are inter
ested in making a difference in the lives of
children from low-income areas.
I would like to encourage these stu
dents to join Teach For America, the na
tional corps of recent college graduates
who commit to spending two years
teaching in low-income urban and rural
public schools and who become lifelong
leaders working to expand opportunity
for children.
In the year since I joined Teach For
America, I have learned one very impor
tant lesson: I did not truly appreciate my
own teachers. I couldn't have until I
walked in their shoes. Teaching is the
hardest job that I've ever had. My first
year in the classroom was incredibly tough
— and incredibly depressing at times —
but I wouldn't trade in the experience for
anything.
I've learned so much in the last year —
about myself, about my students, about
their parents, and about what a school
should be and what it shouldn't be. Work
ing in an inner city so-called "failing"
school has been a real eye opener. It
makes me so sad, and so mad, to see how
we as a nation are failing so many of our
children.
How can my student Miguel get to fifth
grade and still not know his alphabet?
How can an eighth grader get a gun and
bring it to my school? How can parents
put a TV in my students' rooms but not
buy them any books to read? How can my
classroom get broken into over the sum
mer, with the thief stealing everything
from our computers to our crayons? How
can my school start the year without a per
manent principal or vice principal?
Yet I've met so many amazing kids,
students like Garrick, Duane and Angel
ica who are eager to learn and are suc
ceeding at it despite everything. For kids
like them, I show up every day and try
my best to teach. For them, I put aside
the often overwhelming reality that I
can't fix all the problems at my school —
or even some of them — and instead con
centrate on how best to present a lesson
on fractions or the Revolutionary War.
For them, I'm leaning toward abandon
ing my former career in journalism — I
was a reporter for The Washington Post
for four years before joining Teach For
America — and instead staying in educa
tion or the non-profit field, perhaps
working up to principal or superinten
dent some day.
Teach For America seeks applicants of
all academic majors, and no previous edu
cation experience or course work is neces
sary. Corps members receive a full salary
from their school district, a $4,725 Ameri-
Corps education grant for each year of
service, and are eligible for loan forbear
ance. The application deadline is Feb. 21.
1 encourage all Stanford students to visit
http://www.teachforamerica.org and
learn more about this movement.
In addition, you can come chat with
Teach For America alumni at the Coffee
House on Jan. 16, 17 and 24, from 10 a.m.
to 3 p.m. There will also be an information
session at the Career Development Center
on Jan. 16 from 7 to 8:30 p.m.
I really encourage Stanford students to
consider joining Teach For America after
graduation. It's one of the best decisions
that I ever made.

Profs ignore larger world atrocities
Prof. Joel Beinin's most recent letter
to The Daily ("Professor's call for Ameri
cans to speak out," Jan. 8) about how Is
rael might react if the U.S. goes to war
against Sadaam Hussein offers quotes
without proper context and ignores not
only history but also the current over
whelming attitudes and behavior of the
Israeli populace. [Editor's note: Beinin is
one of 800 American professors who co
signed the letter.]
I do applaud Beinin's call for vigi
lance against possible future crimes.
This is good general advice for every
one. How much more believable his cry
would be, though, if he had also raised
it during past and present war crimes
in the region, such as the over 250,000
Marsh Arabs (Madan) who were
forcibly expelled in southern Iraq after
the Gulf War concluded (The
Guardian, Jan. 6, 2003; The Sunday
Times, Dec. 29, 2002).
How much better, especially fora
scholar of a such a respectable university,
if Beinin would raise his voice or pen in
protest over crimes going on at this mo
ment elsewhere in the Middle East, such
as the radical Islamists' uprising in Alge
ria that has claimed over 120,000 lives
(Associated Press, Jan. 5, 2003) or the ac
tive practicing of the slave trade and
forced conversion by the National Islam
ic Front government of Sudan (The
Boston Globe, Feb. 19, 1999).
Worse, that government of Sudan has
killed or encouraged the killing of over
two million black non-Muslim civilians
through either outright murder or
forced starvation that continues today in
a deliberate campaign of genocide (The
