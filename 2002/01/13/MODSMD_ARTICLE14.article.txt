# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## There are no happy endings 
### 
A wise woman once told me that, to
achieve inner peace, you must finish
what you have started. If only it
were that easy.
My favorite part of the beginning of
the quarter is going to the used book
store on Castro Street in Mountain View
and hunting around for books for my
classes. Part of its appeal is the sneaky
sensation that I'm screwing over eFollett
(take that, Stanford Bookstore!), but the
real thrill comes from just being around
all those books. You know, that tingly
feeling you got as a kid when your par
ents took you to the public library. That
thing.
My least favorite part of the beginning

of the quarter is taking
home my stack of new
used books and trying to
fit them all on these Stan
ford Housing-issued
shelves. I find them aes
thetically displeasing, for
one thing, and much too
small. One year, I lived in
Stern and just about the

only redeeming thing about that living sit
uation was the stack of built-in book
shelves on the wall above my desk. Hee
hee, decorating goodness.
The point of this story is, I consistently
end up buying more books than I'll ever
be able to finish reading. So I end up with
all these shelves full of pretty paperbacks.
You know when you walk into someone's
room, and they have shelves and shelves of
books, and some snarky person always
asks, "Wow, have you read all these?" I'm
one of the people who hasn't. Yes, I am a
big poser. Kill me now.
It's just that I get so excited about the
things I want to learn and the things I
want to do that I forget that I am human,
and also that I have a tendency to fall
asleep when reading. Mercy me, if I had a
nickel for every time I've crawled into bed
with a book in hand and fallen asleep less
than two pages in. ..
I don't think I'm alone in saying that I
almost never read every single page of
reading assigned fora class. It's part lazi
ness and part poor time management — if
something's going to fall by the wayside,
I'd quite frankly have it be the lesser works
of Nietzsche than time spent with my
friends. Hmm, better make that all the
works of Nietzsche.
So I happen to own quite a few books
that I've never finished reading. This lack
of follow-through on my part unfortu
nately extends to other parts of my life as
well. I have a lot of unfinished business.
The graduate school applications sitting
on my desk. Christmas cards that never
got written. A certain Incomplete that's
been mucking up my transcript.
Again, I don't think I'm alone here in
being one of those Stanford students who
feels pressured into juggling five or six dif
ferent projects at a time. It's just so excit
ing, the beginning of the quarter, or real

ly the beginning of anything — I just want
to have it all.
But as I have been in the process of
discovering, I can't. Have it all, that is. At
least not all at the same time., I'm one of
those people with low attention spans
who'll be in the middle of boiling water
for pasta, walk away to get a drink, get
distracted by the flower arrangements in
the dining room and decide to drive to
Safeway for new carnations while the
water boils over. No talent for multitask
ing here.
So when I was told that inner peace is
achieved by finishing what you've start
ed, I was like, "No kidding." Unfinished
business is the story of my life. I started
reorganizing my universe in my head
and made all sorts of promises to myself,
like, "I will set aside two hours per day
just for reading," and"I will get a filing
system for my Christmas cards and such
so I'll get caught up on my correspon
dence." Stuff like that, on up to "I will de
vise and implement an evil-genius plan to
end world hunger while simultaneously
becoming filthy rich."
But once you've got it all figured out,
when you've shaped the world into the
way you want it, what next? It's the same
sort of thing that happens after the"The
End" of a well-written story. What hap
pened after the end? After the bad guy
was defeated, did more bad guys rise up
or was the kingdom safe and boring for
ever after?
What would it be like to have finished
everything you ever wanted to do? To
have nothing more on your plate; to have
completed your life's work? What is it like
to have the best thing you'll ever accom
plish in life behind you?
I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person
to say that the natural state of human af
fairs is not inertia, but constant struggle. I
think it was Nietzsche who wrote that
(argh, just can't escape his bunk ass.) And
to me, that makes a lot of sense. I've
learned enough about myself to know that
I'm a creature of routine — 1 function best
when I have something to wake up to
every day. But I feel that life would be
empty if it was the exact same thing, day
after day.
Life is fuller somehow when you
have something to fight for, or to fight
against. The exciting part for us twen
ty-somethings is figuring out what
we're fighting for. We are learning
each day how to choose our battles, and
choose them wisely.
Perhaps if I were older, I'd be better
served by searching for inner peace, by
looking back on my life and evaluating
what I have already accomplished. But
I'm young enough, I think, that it's okay
for me to be more excited now about the
books I have yet to read than the books I
have read. To be looking forward to the
things I will do rather than the things that

I've done.
Achieving inner peace is the end of the
story. I'm only at the start of mine.
There's no such thing as happy endings,
because there are no endings, or begin
nings for that matter. What matters is
what happens in between.
