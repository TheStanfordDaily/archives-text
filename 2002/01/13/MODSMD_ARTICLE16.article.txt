Alumna urges students to join Teach
for America
My name is Beth Berselli, and I gradu
ated from Stanford in 1997. I'm currently
teaching fifth grade in Phoenix as a Teach
For America corps member. I know there
are many Stanford students who are inter
ested in making a difference in the lives of
children from low-income areas.
I would like to encourage these stu
dents to join Teach For America, the na
tional corps of recent college graduates
who commit to spending two years
teaching in low-income urban and rural
public schools and who become lifelong
leaders working to expand opportunity
for children.
In the year since I joined Teach For
America, I have learned one very impor
tant lesson: I did not truly appreciate my
own teachers. I couldn't have until I
walked in their shoes. Teaching is the
hardest job that I've ever had. My first
year in the classroom was incredibly tough
— and incredibly depressing at times —
but I wouldn't trade in the experience for
anything.
I've learned so much in the last year —
about myself, about my students, about
their parents, and about what a school
should be and what it shouldn't be. Work
ing in an inner city so-called "failing"
school has been a real eye opener. It
makes me so sad, and so mad, to see how
we as a nation are failing so many of our
children.
How can my student Miguel get to fifth
grade and still not know his alphabet?
How can an eighth grader get a gun and
bring it to my school? How can parents
put a TV in my students' rooms but not
buy them any books to read? How can my
classroom get broken into over the sum
mer, with the thief stealing everything

from our computers to our crayons? How
can my school start the year without a per
manent principal or vice principal?
Yet I've met so many amazing kids,
students like Garrick, Duane and Angel
ica who are eager to learn and are suc
ceeding at it despite everything. For kids
like them, I show up every day and try
my best to teach. For them, I put aside
the often overwhelming reality that I
can't fix all the problems at my school —
or even some of them — and instead con
centrate on how best to present a lesson
on fractions or the Revolutionary War.
For them, I'm leaning toward abandon
ing my former career in journalism — I
was a reporter for The Washington Post
for four years before joining Teach For
America — and instead staying in educa
tion or the non-profit field, perhaps
working up to principal or superinten
dent some day.
Teach For America seeks applicants of
all academic majors, and no previous edu
cation experience or course work is neces
sary. Corps members receive a full salary
from their school district, a $4,725 Ameri-
Corps education grant for each year of
service, and are eligible for loan forbear
ance. The application deadline is Feb. 21.
1 encourage all Stanford students to visit
http://www.teachforamerica.org and
learn more about this movement.
In addition, you can come chat with
Teach For America alumni at the Coffee
House on Jan. 16, 17 and 24, from 10 a.m.
to 3 p.m. There will also be an information
session at the Career Development Center
on Jan. 16 from 7 to 8:30 p.m.
I really encourage Stanford students to
consider joining Teach For America after
graduation. It's one of the best decisions
that I ever made.

Profs ignore larger world atrocities
Prof. Joel Beinin's most recent letter
to The Daily ("Professor's call for Ameri
cans to speak out," Jan. 8) about how Is
rael might react if the U.S. goes to war
against Sadaam Hussein offers quotes
without proper context and ignores not
only history but also the current over
whelming attitudes and behavior of the
Israeli populace. [Editor's note: Beinin is
one of 800 American professors who co
signed the letter.]
I do applaud Beinin's call for vigi
lance against possible future crimes.
This is good general advice for every
one. How much more believable his cry
would be, though, if he had also raised
it during past and present war crimes
in the region, such as the over 250,000
Marsh Arabs (Madan) who were
forcibly expelled in southern Iraq after
the Gulf War concluded (The
Guardian, Jan. 6, 2003; The Sunday
Times, Dec. 29, 2002).
How much better, especially fora
scholar of a such a respectable university,
if Beinin would raise his voice or pen in
protest over crimes going on at this mo
ment elsewhere in the Middle East, such
as the radical Islamists' uprising in Alge
ria that has claimed over 120,000 lives
(Associated Press, Jan. 5, 2003) or the ac
tive practicing of the slave trade and
forced conversion by the National Islam
ic Front government of Sudan (The
Boston Globe, Feb. 19, 1999).
Worse, that government of Sudan has
killed or encouraged the killing of over
two million black non-Muslim civilians
through either outright murder or
forced starvation that continues today in
a deliberate campaign of genocide (The
Washington Times, Nov. 4, 2002; The
National Post, Feb. 17, 2000; Abolitionist
Leadership Counsel, Jan. 31, 1997).
Beinin's silence in face of these
large-scale atrocities rings far louder
than his cry of an imaginary future.
Moreover, reality is quite different
from what he suggests.
So far, Israel's behavior during the
last U.S. war against Iraq was to quietly
absorb 40 hits by Iraqi Scud missiles. So
far, it is popular groups such as Hamas,
Islamic Jihad and others in the region,
such as Hezbollah, who loudly and re
peatedly advocate genocide, even in el

ementary school textbooks, by vowing
to push the Israeli Jews into the sea.

Bike fliers are 'a waste of money 7
I would like to make a comment about
those bike fliers that the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety stapled to ev
eryone's bike over the weekend. I think
the project was dumb and a waste of
money. The project did not result in a
rise in student awareness of the biking
laws, the result was a lot of colorful litter
on the ground.
Luckily my bike was parked next to a
recycling bin, so I just threw it into the
mixed paper one. As is evident by all the

little fliers on the ground, however, most
people didn't do that.
I guess the Stanford Department of
Public Safety failed to realize that those
fliers weren't going to all of a sudden
make people stop at the stop signs or go
out and buy a bike light (or just get some
new batteries).
If we decided not to follow those bik
ing laws, the fliers definitely weren't
going to change our minds. We already
know what the laws are and most of us
just choose not to follow them. The
money used to create and distribute the
fliers along with the litter clean-up,
could have been used to do better things,
such as those bike fix-it stands they had
last quarter.

manent principal or vice principal?
Yet I've met so many amazing kids,
students like Garrick, Duane and Angel
ica who are eager to learn and are suc
ceeding at it despite everything. For kids
like them, I show up every day and try
my best to teach. For them, I put aside
the often overwhelming reality that I
can't fix all the problems at my school —
or even some of them — and instead con
centrate on how best to present a lesson
on fractions or the Revolutionary War.
For them, I'm leaning toward abandon
ing my former career in journalism — I
was a reporter for The Washington Post
for four years before joining Teach For
America — and instead staying in educa
tion or the non-profit field, perhaps
working up to principal or superinten
dent some day.
Teach For America seeks applicants of
all academic majors, and no previous edu
cation experience or course work is neces
sary. Corps members receive a full salary
from their school district, a $4,725 Ameri-
Corps education grant for each year of
service, and are eligible for loan forbear
ance. The application deadline is Feb. 21.

Profs ignore larger world atrocities
Prof. Joel Beinin's most recent letter
to The Daily ("Professor's call for Ameri
cans to speak out," Jan. 8) about how Is
rael might react if the U.S. goes to war
against Sadaam Hussein offers quotes
without proper context and ignores not
only history but also the current over
whelming attitudes and behavior of the
Israeli populace. [Editor's note: Beinin is
one of 800 American professors who co
signed the letter.]
I do applaud Beinin's call for vigi
lance against possible future crimes.
This is good general advice for every
one. How much more believable his cry
would be, though, if he had also raised
it during past and present war crimes
in the region, such as the over 250,000
Marsh Arabs (Madan) who were
forcibly expelled in southern Iraq after
the Gulf War concluded (The
Guardian, Jan. 6, 2003; The Sunday
Times, Dec. 29, 2002).
How much better, especially fora
scholar of a such a respectable university,
if Beinin would raise his voice or pen in
protest over crimes going on at this mo
ment elsewhere in the Middle East, such
as the radical Islamists' uprising in Alge
ria that has claimed over 120,000 lives
(Associated Press, Jan. 5, 2003) or the ac
tive practicing of the slave trade and
forced conversion by the National Islam
ic Front government of Sudan (The
Boston Globe, Feb. 19, 1999).
Worse, that government of Sudan has
killed or encouraged the killing of over
two million black non-Muslim civilians
through either outright murder or
forced starvation that continues today in
a deliberate campaign of genocide (The
Washington Times, Nov. 4, 2002; The
National Post, Feb. 17, 2000; Abolitionist
Leadership Counsel, Jan. 31, 1997).
Beinin's silence in face of these
large-scale atrocities rings far louder
than his cry of an imaginary future.
Moreover, reality is quite different
from what he suggests.
So far, Israel's behavior during the
last U.S. war against Iraq was to quietly
absorb 40 hits by Iraqi Scud missiles. So
far, it is popular groups such as Hamas,
Islamic Jihad and others in the region,
such as Hezbollah, who loudly and re
peatedly advocate genocide, even in el

ementary school textbooks, by vowing
to push the Israeli Jews into the sea.

Bike fliers are 'a waste of money 7
I would like to make a comment about
those bike fliers that the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety stapled to ev
eryone's bike over the weekend. I think
the project was dumb and a waste of
money. The project did not result in a
rise in student awareness of the biking
laws, the result was a lot of colorful litter
on the ground.
Luckily my bike was parked next to a
recycling bin, so I just threw it into the
mixed paper one. As is evident by all the

little fliers on the ground, however, most
people didn't do that.
I guess the Stanford Department of
Public Safety failed to realize that those
fliers weren't going to all of a sudden
make people stop at the stop signs or go
out and buy a bike light (or just get some
new batteries).
If we decided not to follow those bik
ing laws, the fliers definitely weren't
going to change our minds. We already
know what the laws are and most of us
just choose not to follow them. The
money used to create and distribute the
fliers along with the litter clean-up,
could have been used to do better things,
such as those bike fix-it stands they had
last quarter.
BEN ILEGBODU
Freshman, Computer Science
Alumna urges students to join Teach
for America
My name is Beth Berselli, and I gradu
ated from Stanford in 1997. I'm currently
teaching fifth grade in Phoenix as a Teach
For America corps member. I know there
are many Stanford students who are inter
ested in making a difference in the lives of
children from low-income areas.
I would like to encourage these stu
dents to join Teach For America, the na
tional corps of recent college graduates
who commit to spending two years
teaching in low-income urban and rural
public schools and who become lifelong
leaders working to expand opportunity
for children.
In the year since I joined Teach For
America, I have learned one very impor
tant lesson: I did not truly appreciate my
own teachers. I couldn't have until I
walked in their shoes. Teaching is the
hardest job that I've ever had. My first
year in the classroom was incredibly tough
— and incredibly depressing at times —
but I wouldn't trade in the experience for
anything.
I've learned so much in the last year —
about myself, about my students, about
their parents, and about what a school
should be and what it shouldn't be. Work
ing in an inner city so-called "failing"
school has been a real eye opener. It
makes me so sad, and so mad, to see how
we as a nation are failing so many of our
children.
How can my student Miguel get to fifth
grade and still not know his alphabet?
How can an eighth grader get a gun and
bring it to my school? How can parents
put a TV in my students' rooms but not
buy them any books to read? How can my
classroom get broken into over the sum
mer, with the thief stealing everything

from our computers to our crayons? How
can my school start the year without a per
manent principal or vice principal?
