# SUV ads stir up controversy
## 
### JEREMY BERKOWITZ MICHIGAN DAILY (U. MICHIGAN 
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR,
Mich. — Debate stemming from
an environmental group that be
lieves fuel-inefficient sports utility
vehicles instigate terrorism has
caused confusion in the Detroit
area because their organization's
name is the same as a local com
munity service group.
The Detroit Project, a Califor
nia-based environmental group, is
persuading television stations
across the country to run advertise
ments convincing Americans not to
utilize SUVs because they require
the U.S. to purchase more oil from
Middle Eastern governments.
Engineering sophomore Jeff
Powers said the group's message is
ridiculous because there are so
many different parts of American
life that require the use of oil, such
as smaller cars and public trans
portation.
"Anybody who doesn't walk or
ride a bike is a supporter [of ter
rorism] to a lesser extent," Powers
said.
Laurie David, a partner in the
Detroit Project, said these Middle
Eastern governments are most
likely funneling a portion of the oil
money proceeds to terrorist
groups.

"We're importing more than
half our oil from unstable regions
in the world," David said. "I don't
think we should be driving cars
that are wasting a natural resource
— particularly one that the United
States does not have much of."
David said the advertisements
are parodies of similar commer
cials sponsored by the Bush ad
ministration last year, which pro
moted the idea that Americans
who did drugs were supporting
terrorists. David said her group
feels the issue of boycotting oil is
more important than abstaining
from drugs.
The group has had trouble con
vincing television stations in the
Motor City area to run the ads.
Davis said she is not surprised be
cause of the relationship between
car manufacturers and local televi
sion stations.
"I don't know if we are going to
be able to persuade them," David
said, adding that it is important for
Americans to gain awareness of
these issues so they can pressure
the automotive industries and the
government. "We have to get the
dialogue going so Detroit hears it."
Although Powers admitted
most SUVs have terrible fuel econ
omy, he said this does not deter
people from buying them.
"I think people purchase them

for what they can do, not for
whether they use too much gas,"
Powers said.
Meanwhile, the University's
Detroit Project, a group that per
forms community service in the
Detroit area, has been receiving
many phone calls and e-mails in
the last few days from people con
fusing the two organizations. LSA
senior and Detroit Project Execu
tive Director Katie Baetens said
she wishes the environmental
group had done some research be
fore they picked their name.
"We are concerned that the
University community would be
confusing these groups once the
ads hit TV," Baetens said. "We
have established a name in the De
troit area that has a lot of positive
connotations."
Baetens said they plan to cam
paign with other newspapers and
local government offices to delin
eate the differences between the
two groups.
"We're going to feel it out and
see if it does negatively affect us,"
she said.
Over the last year, the Detroit
Project — founded in 2000 — has
completed 25 one-day projects in
Detroit as well as run 13 tutoring
projects. They will also hold their
semi-annual community Day of
Service March 29.
