The team won nine out of 11

dual-meet victory over Michigan.
In the first event of the meet, the
400-yard medley relay, Stanford
finished 1-2. The team of juniors
Peter Marshall, Michael Bruce and
Andrew Schnell and sophomore
Jayme Cramer touched first in a
season-best time of 3 minutes,
14.15 seconds.
Michigan battled back in the
1000 free, as freshman Peter Van
derkaay swam to a first-place fin
ish in 9:01.20. Touching second
and third were Stanford junior
Matt Sorlien (9:08.46) and fresh
man Michael McLean (9:09.67),
respectively.
Not to be thwarted by the
Wolverines' early individual win, the
Cardinal outswam Michigan in the
200 free, securing two of the top

three spots. Junior Markus Rogan
barely out-touched Michigan's Dan
Ketchum and won the event in
1:37.28, and senior John Waters
took third in 1:37.48. Both Rogan's
and Waters' times qualified as
NCAA consideration marks.
Stanford swept the top three
spots in the 50 freestyle, as senior
Randall Bal, Marshall and junior
Bobby O'Bryan took first, second
and third, respectively.
In the 200 individual medley,
sophomore Dan Trupin turned
in a time of 1:46.51, earning the
win and breaking the pool record
set by Rogan last season. Fresh
man Tobias Oriwol and Bruce
battled for second place, with
Oriwol edging out Bruce by only
.04 seconds.
The Cardinal divers also con
tributed 27 points to Stanford's vic
tory over Michigan.
In the one-meter springboard
competition, sophomore Adam Pe
terson dove to first place with
219.20 points. Senior teammate
Gavin Olmstead finished third with
a score of 170.85, while sophomore
JefFDurbin also scored for the Car
dinal with a fifth -place finish.
"The team really dove well as a
whole. It was just a great meet," Pe
terson said. "We have been training
so hard and it really paid off."
The Cardinal also placed all
three divers in the top five of the
three-meter event. Olmstead won
with a score 0f324.00, and Peterson
and Durbin placed second and
fifth, respectively.
Cramer, senior Dan Westcott and
sophomore Matt McDonald swept
the 200 fly, and O'Bryan and Bal

nabbed die top two spots in the 100
free. Trupin tied for third in the 100
free event with Michigan's Garrett
Mangieri. Stanford's Marshall and
Rogan finished 1-2 in the 200 back
stroke in 1:44.44 and 1:45.43, re
spectively.
Vanderkaay, the freshman dis
tance sensation from Michigan,
picked up his second win of the
day in the 500 free, once again
topping Stanford's Sorlien and
McLean. Stanford went on to

notch wins in the three-meter div
ing event and the 200 breast
stroke, however, as Bruce out
touched Michigan's Jeff Hop
wood, a fifth-year senior from
Palo Alto. Bruce clocked a time of
1:59.77, Hopwood finished in
2:01.40, and Stanford senior Pat
Fowler took third in 2:03.45.
In the final event of the compe
tition, the Cardinal breezed past
Michigan, posting the top two
times in the 400 free relay. All in all,

the Cardinal seemed pleased with
the outcome of the meet.
"It was very exciting to beat that
high ranked of a team this early in the
season," Peterson said. "We are all
ready to have a truly great season."
In a less contested meet on Sat
urday at Avery, Stanford secured
two victories over Cal State-Bakers
field (103-85) and Pacific (102-95)
in a double-dual competition. The
wins improved the Cardinal's
