# Women squeak by Ducks, 75-74

### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
EUGENE, Ore. — McArthur
Court has been a house of horrors
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team over the years; most re
cently, the Cardinal had dropped
three out of its past four at Oregon.

Women's Basketball
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 75, Oregon 74

And fora while Saturday night,
it seemed like old times in that
aged Eugene building. The deci
bel level got so ridiculously high
that the arena shook (literally, the
backboards trembled in fear), and
players couldn't even hear the sets
called from the bench.
But junior forward Nicole Pow
ell came through in the game's
waning moments to make sure all
that craziness was for naught.
After a crazy sequence of
events, Powell nailed two free
throws with 1.3 seconds left as No.
6 Stanford (12-1, 4-0 Pacific-10
Conference) eked out a thrilling
75-74 victory over the Ducks (6-9,
2-4) and extended its Pac-10 win
ning streak to 25 games.

Ganes made two free throws with
3.3 seconds remaining, appeared
doomed to yet another faltering at
Mac Court.
But after a timeout, and a dia
grammed play by head coach Tara
VanDerveer, Stanford pulled off
basketball's version of the Hail Mary.
T'Nae Thiel played quarter
back, tossing a 75-foot bomb
downcourt to Powell, who some
how got behind Ducks defender
Kedzie Gunderson at the right
elbow and drew a foul.
Boos immediately rained out
from Ducks supporters, who
thought the foul was called on
what appeared to be a clean block
by the trailing Brandi Davis.
But the officials ruled the foul
occurred on the floor — where
Gunderson visibly tackled Powell
from behind — so the junior
stepped to the line facing a one
and-one situation.
As an angry crowd tried to up
root Mac Court from its founda
tions, Powell made both shots at the
stripe (letting out a primal scream
to the rafters after making the front
end), and Stanford escaped the
Pac-10's toughest road venue by
erasing a second-half deficit for the

sixth time this season.
In her fourth game back since re
turning from a back injury, Powell
reasserted herself as the kind of
clutch player the Cardinal can
count on when March rolls around.
"We won more than a game
tonight," VanDerveer said. "It was
really good for her to step in and
make an All-American play when
there was a lot of pressure."
Stanford also accomplished
something VanDerveer had em
phasized again and again in prac
tice, in talks with players and with
the media.
It got the ball inside to Thiel.
The Cardinal's offense has been
nothing short of efficient this sea
son, drawing on its balance to
shoulder the load. But the 6-foot-1
forward Thiel had been the one
starter without significant offen
sive production.
So Stanford made a concerted
effort to deliver the ball to its
sophomore defensive stalwart —
and just like that, it found results.
Thiel had a season-high 18
points while chipping in eight re
bounds and four assists in her
most spectacular game of the year.
But it was balance once again
that let the Cardinal prevail against
the Ducks. Led by Thiel, Stanford
had four players in double figures
for the fifth time this season.
Sophomore Chelsea Trotter put
in another solid effort with 16 points,
while sophomore Sebnem Kimya
cioglu added 14. Powell also had 10.
The offensive boosts were sorely
needed against the Ducks since lead
ing scorer sophomore Kelley Sum
inski battled the flu and was held
scoreless for the first time all year.
These contributions were nearly
not enough as Oregon staged a furi
ous rally in the last half of the game.
After Trotter hit a 3-pointer from
the top of the key with 10:36 re
maining, Stanford finally appeared
comfortable after having mounted
what at die time seemed to be an in

surmountable 15-point lead.
Not quite insurmountable, as it
turned out.
Oregon went on a 21-7 run —
led by Andrea Bills, who had nine
points inside during the run, and
Alissa Edwards, who picked up six
from the perimeter — to pull
within one at 69-68. The Ducks fi
nally took the lead at 72-71 when
Yadili Okwumabua converted a
layup with 1:32 to go in the game.
"We knew coming in that Ore
gon had a lot of talent and that it
was going to be a really tough
game," Thiel said. "It's always
hard to play here because the fans
are outrageous."
It was clearly a frustrating loss
for the Ducks, who played one of
their best games in a year marked
by turmoil. Oregon established a
season-high in assists (21) and tied
for the fewest number of turnovers
with only eight in the loss.
But that still wasn't enough.
"We fought hard and did all we
could," Edwards lamented.
For Stanford, this weekend's
trip to Oregon, if nothing else,
proved that a reprise of its 18-0
conference record a year ago will
be hard to come by.
"We don't expect to necessarily
run the table in the Pac-10," Van-
Derveer said. "The league is
strong and we know we'll get
everyone's 'A' game."

Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 75, Oregon 74

And fora while Saturday night,
it seemed like old times in that
aged Eugene building. The deci
bel level got so ridiculously high
that the arena shook (literally, the
backboards trembled in fear), and
players couldn't even hear the sets
called from the bench.
But junior forward Nicole Pow
ell came through in the game's
waning moments to make sure all
that craziness was for naught.
After a crazy sequence of
events, Powell nailed two free
throws with 1.3 seconds left as No.
6 Stanford (12-1, 4-0 Pacific-10
Conference) eked out a thrilling
75-74 victory over the Ducks (6-9,
2-4) and extended its Pac-10 win
ning streak to 25 games.
The Cardinal trailing by a buck

Ganes made two free throws with
3.3 seconds remaining, appeared
doomed to yet another faltering at
Mac Court.
But after a timeout, and a dia
grammed play by head coach Tara
VanDerveer, Stanford pulled off
basketball's version of the Hail Mary.
T'Nae Thiel played quarter
back, tossing a 75-foot bomb
downcourt to Powell, who some
how got behind Ducks defender
Kedzie Gunderson at the right
elbow and drew a foul.
Boos immediately rained out
from Ducks supporters, who
thought the foul was called on
what appeared to be a clean block
by the trailing Brandi Davis.
But the officials ruled the foul
occurred on the floor — where
Gunderson visibly tackled Powell
from behind — so the junior
stepped to the line facing a one
and-one situation.
As an angry crowd tried to up
root Mac Court from its founda
tions, Powell made both shots at the
stripe (letting out a primal scream
to the rafters after making the front
end), and Stanford escaped the
Pac-10's toughest road venue by
erasing a second-half deficit for the

sixth time this season.
In her fourth game back since re
turning from a back injury, Powell
reasserted herself as the kind of
clutch player the Cardinal can
count on when March rolls around.
"We won more than a game
tonight," VanDerveer said. "It was
really good for her to step in and
make an All-American play when
there was a lot of pressure."
Stanford also accomplished
something VanDerveer had em
phasized again and again in prac
tice, in talks with players and with
the media.
It got the ball inside to Thiel.
The Cardinal's offense has been
nothing short of efficient this sea
son, drawing on its balance to
shoulder the load. But the 6-foot-1
forward Thiel had been the one
starter without significant offen
sive production.
So Stanford made a concerted
effort to deliver the ball to its
sophomore defensive stalwart —
and just like that, it found results.
Thiel had a season-high 18
points while chipping in eight re
bounds and four assists in her
most spectacular game of the year.
But it was balance once again
that let the Cardinal prevail against
the Ducks. Led by Thiel, Stanford
had four players in double figures
for the fifth time this season.
Sophomore Chelsea Trotter put
in another solid effort with 16 points,
while sophomore Sebnem Kimya
cioglu added 14. Powell also had 10.
The offensive boosts were sorely
needed against the Ducks since lead
ing scorer sophomore Kelley Sum
inski battled the flu and was held
scoreless for the first time all year.
These contributions were nearly
not enough as Oregon staged a furi
ous rally in the last half of the game.
After Trotter hit a 3-pointer from
the top of the key with 10:36 re
maining, Stanford finally appeared
comfortable after having mounted
what at die time seemed to be an in

surmountable 15-point lead.
Not quite insurmountable, as it
turned out.
Oregon went on a 21-7 run —
led by Andrea Bills, who had nine
points inside during the run, and
Alissa Edwards, who picked up six
from the perimeter — to pull
within one at 69-68. The Ducks fi
nally took the lead at 72-71 when
Yadili Okwumabua converted a
layup with 1:32 to go in the game.
"We knew coming in that Ore
gon had a lot of talent and that it
was going to be a really tough
game," Thiel said. "It's always
hard to play here because the fans
are outrageous."
It was clearly a frustrating loss
for the Ducks, who played one of
their best games in a year marked
by turmoil. Oregon established a
season-high in assists (21) and tied
for the fewest number of turnovers
with only eight in the loss.
But that still wasn't enough.
"We fought hard and did all we
could," Edwards lamented.
For Stanford, this weekend's
trip to Oregon, if nothing else,
proved that a reprise of its 18-0
conference record a year ago will
be hard to come by.
"We don't expect to necessarily
run the table in the Pac-10," Van-
Derveer said. "The league is
strong and we know we'll get
everyone's 'A' game."
