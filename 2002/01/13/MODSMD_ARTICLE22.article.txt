# Gentry takes 157 title at Davis' Aggie Open
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Only two days removed from a
lopsided 38-6 loss at home to
Pennsylvania, the Stanford
wrestling team demonstrated that,
while down, it is certainly not out
this season with a strong showing
on Saturday at the Aggie Open at
UC-Davis.
Fourteen wrestlers competed
for Stanford (2-6), which was look
ing to get back on track after its dis
mal performance against the
Quakers, its fifth straight dual
meet loss.
With several redshirts — who
cannot compete in dual meets —

getting a chance to suit up with
other team members at Davis,
Stanford took full advantage of the
opportunity to snap out of its re
cent struggles.
The Cardinal's success was
highlighted by redshirt sopho
more Matt Gentry's title at 157
pounds and a pair of place-win
ners at 174, redshirt freshman
Ryan Hagen and senior Harold
Penson, who finished in third and
fifth, respectively.
Hagen's 5-1 record included a
tight 3-1 decision over Minnesota's
Casey Flaherty and a 7-2 downing
of Menlo's Will Falvey. The only
blemish in Hagen's record came in
a 1-0 loss to Penn's Greg Hallahan

in his second bout of the day.
Three wins later, however,
Hagen would have the last word,
earning a 5-2 decision over Halla
han in the third-place bout.
"This really helped my confi
dence because I'm finally doing
what I should be doing," Hagen
said.
After not starting on Thursday
against Penn, Penson was equally
impressive at 174, needing just five
total minutes to pin his first two op
ponents. In his next bout, he lost to
Penn's Matt Herrington, the even
tual champion at 174, in a close 8-
6 decision before tallying yet an
other pin against Fullerton's Jon
Brandon.

Penson, who came into the
tournament with just four wins
and one pin this season, would add
two more wins on the day, includ
ing a 13-0 major decision over Co
lumbia's Nick Carrier, and fin
ished with a 5-3 record.
"I felt like the team had a lot of
setbacks over winter break and so
did I," Penson said. "Today, I
stopped caring about winning and
started caring about performing,
and it made a difference."
But the most impressive perfor
mance belonged to Gentry, who
increased his team-leading victory
total to 19 with a 4-0 record on Sat
