# NCAA chief brings reforms

### 
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) —
Myles Brand foresees some dra
matic changes on the horizon for
intercollegiate sports, but the new
NCAA president stresses that re
forms will not be made hastily.
Addressing one of the many is
sues facing the NCAA, Brand said
he feels punishment "should have
teeth" for universities and colleges
that are not providing proper aca
demic opportunities to their stu
dent-athletes.
"But decision-making has to be
evidence-based," Brand said at a
news conference Saturday during
the NCAA convention. "We can
not deal with anecdote or feel
good means.
"If we're going to make a
change that's going to affect peo
ple's lives, we have to take time to
get the data. I don't mean forever;
we have to make timely decisions."
Academics will be one of the
main thrusts for Brand, the for
mer president at Oregon and In
diana who is the first sitting uni
versity president chosen to head
the NCAA.
He said his primary goals for
the NCAA are "sustaining and
completing the academic reform
movement and also being a force
ful advocate for the positive values
of intercollegiate athletics."
"That's what I'm going to de
vote my time to. Within that con
text, there are a whole range of is
sues that have to be addressed —
the inclusion of minorities in lead
ership positions, coaching posi
tions, athletic director positions
and similarly, full participation by
women," Brand said.

He said the NCAA will look at a
broad range of issues.
"What I'm passionate about is
the conclusion, reaching the end
state in which all student-athletes
have full opportunities to take ad
vantage of the best education their
college or university has to offer so
they have the full set of academic
opportunities to prosper in school
and beyond," Brand said.
Asked if there was any possibili
ty the NCAA might seek an an
titrust exemption, such as Major
League Baseball currently has,
Brand said there wasn't any plan
in place right now.
"I know there are some in
Washington, for example, that
would encourage us to do that," he
said. "I don't want to rule it out,
but I'm not about to begin the
process of doing it, either. I've
been on the job less than two
weeks, so I don't think I have all
the answers. But that is something
that has been mentioned and I
think it needs to be reviewed."
Brand strongly backs Title IX,
which is being reviewed by the fed
eral government, although he be
lieves it could be applied better.
"I have two young granddaugh
ters and I want to make sure they
have every opportunity to succeed
on the athletic field and in the class
room," he said. "I'm also an advo
cate for full participation of men."
Some men's sports have been
eliminated at schools seeking to
balance men's and women's
sports. The National Wrestling
Coaches Association filed a lawsuit
against the Education Depart
ment, claiming Title IX doesn't

fulfill its intent if it's used to restrict
men's opportunities and not in
crease women's.
"I think we have to find ways
in which we implement Title IX
that do not detract from men's
opportunities," Brand said. "I
don't believe that's wishful think
ing, but I also don't believe it's
easy. It's not one of the other. We
have to do both."
Brand, who in the past ex
pressed concern with what he
called the "arms race" in college
basketball and football, said spend
ing on athletics will be studied.
"Expenditures for intercolle
giate athletic programs is surely
something we have to take notice
of and account of," he said. "We
need, first of all, to get a better un
derstanding of what the expendi
ture rates really are. I don't think
right now we have good data to
say who's abusing the system and
who isn't.
"Certainly there have been in
creases, sometimes large increases
in athletic expenditures at differ
ent programs. But there have also
been increases in other parts of the
university, too. You have to see
how it all fits in."
Brand, who assumed the
NCAA post on Jan. l,whenCedric
Dempsey's retirement became of
ficial, smiled as he recalled his first
two weeks on the job.
"It's been a learning experience
and it's been enjoyable, although I
do feel a little bit like the two-head
ed calf in the county fair, where
everyone wants to get a look at me,"
he said. "I assume once that's done,
we can go about our business."

ment, claiming Title IX doesn't

fulfill its intent if it's used to restrict
men's opportunities and not in
crease women's.
"I think we have to find ways
in which we implement Title IX
that do not detract from men's
opportunities," Brand said. "I
don't believe that's wishful think
ing, but I also don't believe it's
easy. It's not one of the other. We
have to do both."
Brand, who in the past ex
pressed concern with what he
called the "arms race" in college
basketball and football, said spend
ing on athletics will be studied.
"Expenditures for intercolle
giate athletic programs is surely
something we have to take notice
of and account of," he said. "We
need, first of all, to get a better un
derstanding of what the expendi
ture rates really are. I don't think
right now we have good data to
say who's abusing the system and
who isn't.
"Certainly there have been in
creases, sometimes large increases
in athletic expenditures at differ
ent programs. But there have also
been increases in other parts of the
university, too. You have to see
how it all fits in."
Brand, who assumed the
NCAA post on Jan. l,whenCedric
Dempsey's retirement became of
ficial, smiled as he recalled his first
two weeks on the job.
"It's been a learning experience
and it's been enjoyable, although I
do feel a little bit like the two-head

everyone wants to get a look at me,"
he said. "I assume once that's done,
we can go about our business."
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) —
Myles Brand foresees some dra
matic changes on the horizon for
intercollegiate sports, but the new
NCAA president stresses that re
forms will not be made hastily.
Addressing one of the many is
sues facing the NCAA, Brand said
he feels punishment "should have
teeth" for universities and colleges
that are not providing proper aca
demic opportunities to their stu
dent-athletes.
"But decision-making has to be
evidence-based," Brand said at a
news conference Saturday during
the NCAA convention. "We can
not deal with anecdote or feel
good means.
"If we're going to make a
change that's going to affect peo
ple's lives, we have to take time to
get the data. I don't mean forever;
we have to make timely decisions."
Academics will be one of the
main thrusts for Brand, the for
mer president at Oregon and In
diana who is the first sitting uni
versity president chosen to head
the NCAA.
He said his primary goals for
the NCAA are "sustaining and
completing the academic reform
movement and also being a force
ful advocate for the positive values
of intercollegiate athletics."
"That's what I'm going to de
vote my time to. Within that con
text, there are a whole range of is
sues that have to be addressed —
the inclusion of minorities in lead
ership positions, coaching posi
tions, athletic director positions
and similarly, full participation by
women," Brand said.

He said the NCAA will look at a
broad range of issues.
"What I'm passionate about is
the conclusion, reaching the end
state in which all student-athletes
have full opportunities to take ad
vantage of the best education their
college or university has to offer so
they have the full set of academic
opportunities to prosper in school
and beyond," Brand said.
Asked if there was any possibili
ty the NCAA might seek an an
titrust exemption, such as Major
League Baseball currently has,
Brand said there wasn't any plan
in place right now.
"I know there are some in
Washington, for example, that
would encourage us to do that," he
said. "I don't want to rule it out,
but I'm not about to begin the
process of doing it, either. I've
been on the job less than two
weeks, so I don't think I have all
the answers. But that is something
that has been mentioned and I
think it needs to be reviewed."
Brand strongly backs Title IX,
which is being reviewed by the fed
eral government, although he be
lieves it could be applied better.
"I have two young granddaugh
ters and I want to make sure they
have every opportunity to succeed
on the athletic field and in the class
room," he said. "I'm also an advo
cate for full participation of men."
Some men's sports have been
eliminated at schools seeking to
balance men's and women's
sports. The National Wrestling
Coaches Association filed a lawsuit
against the Education Depart
ment, claiming Title IX doesn't

fulfill its intent if it's used to restrict
men's opportunities and not in
crease women's.
"I think we have to find ways
in which we implement Title IX
that do not detract from men's
opportunities," Brand said. "I
don't believe that's wishful think
ing, but I also don't believe it's
easy. It's not one of the other. We
have to do both."
