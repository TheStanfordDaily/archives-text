# Duke remains as only unbeaten

DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Mike
Krzyzewski keeps saying he's got
a very different Duke team than
in years past. The results sure
look strikingly similar.
Dahntay Jones shook off a mis
erable start to score 15 of his 16
points in the opening eight and a
half minutes of the second half as
the top-ranked Blue Devils rolled
over No. 17 Wake Forest 74-55 in
a matchup of the last two Division
I unbeatens Sunday night.
"It's very different because it's
not predictable," Krzyzewski said
of his young team. "You try to do
things and then you react to
where your guys are at at a spe
cific time. We've tried not to put
limitations on them. We're still
trying to find out about our team
and our guys understand that.
"With the competition we're
now facing, you have to get bet
ter," Krzyzewski added. "You can
practice and plan and do all that
stuff, but really the game itself
makes you better and the compe
tition in our league makes you
better. We have to get better or
we'll get tossed aside."
This just in: Duke is good
again — very good.
"Duke is excellent here. Heck,
they're excellent every place,"
Wake Forest coach Skip Prosser
said after watching his previously
undefeated team dismantled in
hostile Cameron Indoor Stadi
um. "They guarded us much bet
ter than we executed offensively.
You don't have to be Dr. Nai
smith to realize that."
Duke (11-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast

Conference) won its 20th straight
in Cameron and 14th in a row
against the Demon Deacons (10-
1, 0-1). Wake Forest's last win
here came in January 1997 with
Tim Duncan as its center.
And Wake Forest's streak of
outshooting and outrebounding
all of its opponents was stopped
in embarrassing fashion after the
Demon Deacons shot 34 percent
in their ACC opener and turned
it over 18 times.
"Two months ago, this proba
bly wasn't viewed as a very big
game," Prosser said. "I give our
kids credit for making it a big
game. Now, Duke responded to
the big game better than we did
and we'll learn from this and get
better. You don't have a whole lot
of choices in this league."
Chris Duhon also was key for
Duke, which has finished No. 1 in
the last four Associated Press sea
son-ending polls. The junior
point guard scored 14 points and
added nine assists in helping
Duke to a 10-point halftime lead.
Duhon was 2-for-22 from 3-
point range in his last six games,
but sank three long-range shots in
the opening 17 minutes as Jones
was struggling to find his game.
And after struggling since get
ting off to a great start, freshman
Shavlik Randolph came to play in
this one against prep rival Eric
Williams. Randolph had 15
points and seven rebounds, while
the 280-pound Williams was a
non-factor on both ends of the
floor for the Demon Deacons,
who were held 32 points under

their scoring average.
"I went out in practice this
week like I had something to
prove and I had one of my best
weeks of practice," Randolph
said.
Meanwhile, Jones started 0-
for-6 from the field, but the se
nior didn't stop firing.
He sank an 18-footer 30 seconds
into the second period, and after
missing his next two shots, went on
a tear that gave the Blue Devils a
24-point lead with 11:37 left.
Jones started his 5-for-6
stretch with a spinning move in
the lane and ended it five minutes
later with a 3-pointer as he scored
13 of Duke's 18 points during
one stretch.
"In the first half I was taking
shots that were available, I don't
think I was pressing," Jones said.
"I was just trying to get my team
mates rolling. In the second half,
I took the same shots and things
started going down."
Prosser had the first change in
his lineup this season when Jamaal
Levy started in place of point
guard Justin Gray, who was late for
a team function earlier in the week.
And Wake Forest got off to a fast
start, but Duke closed the first half
with a 10-0 run to take control.
Duhon had quite a final six
minutes of the period. He nailed
three 3-pointers in a span of 2:50
to get Duke's struggling offense
jumpstarted. After displaying his
range, Duhon then fed Casey
Sanders and Randolph for dunks
as the Blue Devils went on top 37-
27 at the break.
