# California Greens meet at Stanford
## Law School grad discusses his election to S. F.'s Board of Supervisors 
### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The California Green Party held its
quarterly plenary meeting this Satur
day and Sunday on the Stanford cam
pus. The 11-year-old party — which
continues to be dogged by perceptions
that Greens such as 2000 presidential
candidate Ralph Nader only take votes
from Democrats and are thus "spoil
ers" — used its first meeting of the
year to comment on recent successes
and plan fora future of growth and
technological innovation.

Among the speakers at the meeting
was Matt Gonzales, a Stanford Law
School alumnus and Green Party
member who was elected president of
San Francisco's Board of Supervisors
on Wednesday. Gonzales described his
election as evidence of growing sup
port for the Greens.
"I think that it's telling when col
leagues look around and they say,
'Who among us are we going to make
stronger, who do we trust to make
stronger?' . . . They're picking the
Green Party," he said.
Gonzales also spoke favorably about
his time at the Law School.
"At the time, the Law School was a
pretty radical place," he said. "There
were some really good students doing
really good work."
Second as policymaker only to San

Francisco's mayor, Gonzales comment
ed on his new role in an interview after
his presentation.
"I think that [my election is] signifi
cant fora couple of reasons," he said. " I
think that post-Nader, there was this
idea that the Greens were going to dis
appear."
During his speech, Gonzales also ex
pressed support for alternative energy
sources, which he identified as a Green
issue.
"I think the Greens have always
been seen to some extent as an envi
ronmental party," he said. "I don't
think [alternative energy technolo
gies such as wind power] will be nec
essarily credited to the Greens, but
there is obvious kinship there, which

is relevant."
Also speaking at the meeting
was Peter Camejo, the Green
candidate who lost to Gray Davis
in last year's gubernatorial race.
Camejo argued against the claim
that the Green Party's candi
dates serve only as spoilers, and
described the country's current
two-party system as "an imperi
alist ruling class running our
country."
Laura Wells, Green candidate
for state controller in 2002, noted
that in the 2002 election, every
Green candidate on the statewide
slate got at least 3.9 percent of the
vote, which was Nader's share in
2000. Wells got 419,873 votes to
Nader's 418,707 in California in
2000.
She also discussed the role of
women in politics.

"It's 2003, and it's time for
[women in elected positions],"
she said.
California Green Party
spokesman Ross Mirkarimi said,
"We, as a political party, have ma
tured over the last two years. The
2000 race really catapulted us into
a different arena."
According to Mirkarimi, nei
ther the Republicans nor the De
mocrats are solving key problems
faced by the nation.
"Right now we have a country
that's on the brink of war, and we
don't really have political repre
sentation that can explain why,"
he said.
Another speaker at the meet
ing was Green Kevin McKe
won, mayor pro temp of Santa
Monica.
"Reducing our dependence
on fossil fuels will put us in a situ
ation where we don't have to
bomb other countries [such as
Iraq] for oil," McKewon said.
"We as Greens are committed to

being strong, but gentle, stew
ards of this planet. That plays out
in social justice and environmen
tal ways."
In an interview following his
speech, McKewon also discussed
the role of technology.
"We have now finished con
verting all of our city facilities to
renewable resource energy," he
said. "[Even] the Ferris wheel on
the Santa Monica Pier is solar
powered, the only one in the
world."
Santa Monica currently uses
geothermal power. McKewon
also works with the Sierra Club on
the development of more fuel-ef
ficient cars.
McKewon also believes tech
nology can assist the war on ter
rorism. While concerned with the
USA Patriot Act, which limits cer
tain civil liberties, McKewon ex
pressed support for an anti-hi
jacking system that will reroute
airplane controls to the ground if
hijacked.
