# Magazine ranks Stanford No. 7 college for African Americans
## 
### VINAY JAIN 
Stanford now ranks alongside the nation's
top historically black colleges and universities as
one of the best schools for African Americans,
according to a study released in this month's
issue of Black Enterprise Magazine.
Stanford came in seventh in the magazine's
2003 rankings of the "Top 50 Colleges for
African Americans," the highest rank of any
non-historically black institution. The num
ber one spot went to Morehouse College in
Atlanta.
"Stanford has a top-flight academic pro
gram and has worked hard to include African
Americans and other minorities as well," said
Derek Dingle, executive editor of Black Enter
prise Magazine.
Asst. Director of Undergraduate Admis
sions Lanita Foley said the ranking reflects the
University's effort to "spread the word effec
tively that Stanford not only embraces diversi
ty of all types, but also fosters a supportive and
engaging environment."
The Admissions Office has actively worked

to bring African Americans to campus through
efforts like the Black Recruitment Orientation
Committee (BROC). The committee puts
prospective African-American students in
touch with current ones.
"I remember being mailed the standard col
lege info packet, but also materials from
BROC," said sophomore Victor Marsh 11. "The
administration is smart to put current black stu
dents right into the recruitment effort."
Such targeted initiatives continue beyond
the admissions process.
"Stanford puts effort not only into recruit
ing top minority students — it also has pro
grams and a support system for retention,
which is what I feel sets it apart from other in
stitutions," said junior Donielle Newell, a for
mer co-chair of the Black Student Union.
Stanford has ranked in the top 10 on Black
Enterprise Magazine's list since 1999, when
the magazine began its biennial study. This
year's rankings are based on a survey sent to
1,855 black professionals working as instruc
tors or administrators in higher education.
They were asked to assess the educational and

social environment for blacks at schools famil
iar to them.
A school's percentage of black students,
or — for historically black colleges and univer
sities — its black graduation rate, was also
taken into account. Each institution's ranking
in the previous study was factored in as well.
Columbia and Georgetown universities
were ranked just behind Stanford on the list,
eighth and ninth, respectively. Harvard Uni
versity, which Stanford unseated last year as
the university with the highest black student
yield (percentage of admits who matriculate)

came in 11th.
The head of the study, Dr.
Thomas LaVeist, an associate
professor of sociology at Johns
Hopkins University, cautioned
against assigning too much im
portance to a school's relative
place on the list.
"A lot of people get into the
issue of the actual ranking," he
said. "We're not actually saying
that number 27 is better than
number 34. The issue is, here are
50 colleges doing a good job of ed
ucating African-Americans."
Still, Foley said she thinks Stan
ford's achievements are unique.
"It is an exciting time to be at
Stanford given the number of
possibilities open to all under
graduates," she said. "There is
no other place like it in the
country."
