"In the beginning, there was
an idea and it was good: A microbrew
to complement the Jewish American
experience."
So goes the label of He'brew's Gene
sis Ale. The punster and founder of
He'brew's Shmaltz Brewing Company
is Stanford University graduate Jere
my Cowan.
Lest the shtick fool you into thinking
it's all in jest, He'brew is officially
kosher and rabbi-approved (except dur
ing Passover, since yeast leavening is a
no-no during the time of matzoh).
The beer idea was an inside joke be
tween Cowan and his friends, the few
Jews in their high school. He recalls jok
ing that it would be "so cool if Jews had
our own beer so they could sponsor our
volleyball team. The name would be
He'brew and the slogan would be 'Don't
| pass out, Passover!'''"
A neophyte to the brewing industry
(and the business world in general),
Cowan contracted with Brew Makers in
Mountain View, to make his first batch
of beer in time for Hanukkah in 1996.
"7 designed He 'brew to be the kind
of beer I like to drink," he explains.
The Genesis Ale (22-ounce bottle,
$2.99) is between a pale ale and an
amber, sweet and malty with a hoppy
kick. Cowan says it can accompany
most American foods.
