# Fleeing terrorists drop materials, clues
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —From Afghanistan to
Furope to the U.S. Midwest, suspected terrorists,
often beating a hasty retreat from their homes,
camps and caves, have left behind a mountain of
suspicious items that IS. investigators are combing
for clues.
Information in some discovered documents
has led to arrests, thwarted attacks and a "peeling
back of the onion of al-Qaida," says one intelli
gence expert.
At a makeshift laboratory in Kabul, there were
smelly liquids and ( haired papers covered with
chemical formulas; in Minnesota, a computer disk
about crop dusting.
In caves outside Kandahar, Arabic-language
exams were found that quiz terrorists-in-train
ing on the best way to shoot down a plane or kill
a man.
I he paper trail alone is like a confetti shower in
a Manhattan parade. But there have also been
videos, artifacts and digital records most foul.
What they all amount to is still being sorted out.
Some may not qualify as much more than terror
ist curios.
But. officials believe documents and a video
tape found in Afghanistan and passed to author
ities in Singapore foiled a planned terrorist at
tack and resulted in the breakup of an al-Qaida
cell there.

Such discoveries have exposed similar cells in
other count lies, officials said, without giving details.
Altogether, there's a lot to sort through.
The materials have been shipped back to the
Washington area for translation and sharing
among the GIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency
and the FBI, said Vince Cannistraro, a former GIA
counterterrorism chief.
"They've found evidence in documents of culpa
bility for specific terrorist operations that have
taken place in the past," lie- said, declining to be
more specific . "They have found names of people
in terrorist cells abroad who are in place to conduct
another operation."
All this has caused a "peeling back of the onion of
al-Qaida" in some parts of the world, he said.
Some of the items at al-Qaida safe houses in
Afghanistan were taken bv journalists or thrown
out by northern alliance troops before U.S. officials
arrived. But the materials found have revealed new
details about bin Laden s terrorist network — clues
that could help prosecutors build c ases against sus
pected terrorists or help investigators interrogating
I aliban and al-Qaida members held captive by the
United States.
An interrogation of a detainee might stall, said
Defense Secretary Donald 11. Rumsfeld, but infor-
mation in a laptop or an address
book in a house in Kabul might ad
vance the case.
"You might arrest somebody
with pocket litter that connects
that person to one of the people
you're interrogating," he said.

Material in Arabic, Urdu, Russ
ian and English indicated the ter
rorist network was studying chem
ical. biological and even nuclear
weapons — although it's unclear
whether any such weapons were
ever produced.
"They were on the run," said
former CIA terrorism analyst
Stan Bedlington. 'They had to
travel light."
Sometimes what turns up is

more of a personal nature.
Found at a makeshift laboratory
in an al-Qaida building in the heart
of Kabul was a letter that a Pak
istani named Mohammed khaliq
wrote to a brother in Peshawar,
Pakistan, after the bombing began.
"Don't worry about me," he
wrote. "Pray for me five times a
day. Our enemy is not strong; we
will win. If we die hpre, there is no
greater reward."
