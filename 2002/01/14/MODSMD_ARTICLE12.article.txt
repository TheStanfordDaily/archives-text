# New policies prevent unit 'shaving'

Students looking to "shave"
nniis — take a class for fewer units
than listed in the Stanford Bulletin
— might be surprised to find out
they can no longer do so.
Before the start of this academ
ic year, some undergraduate stu
dents would shave units to meet
their 20-unit limit requirements,
whereas graduate students, who
are billed per unit for tuition,
would do so to reduce costs.
But since graduate students are
now billed differently, University
Registrar Roger Printup decided
to disallow the practice.
Printup said graduate students
had research or teaching assist
antships, which, in the past, were
112 unded only at the nine-unit rate.
"If a graduate student wanted
to take two five-unit classes, his as
sistantship would not cover that
additional unit of tuition," he ex
plained. "So graduate students
were permitted to 'shave' the unit,
take the course, get the credit and
not have to pay any money out of
their own pockets for that tuition."

Faking courses for fewer units
than stated in the Stanford Bul
letin accommodated many gradu
ate students' needs.
But beginning this new acade
mic year, the University began to
charge graduate students $5,375
for eight, nine or 10 units, as
printed in the lime Schedule
and Stanford Bulletin. Thus,
Printup said he did not feel a
need to continue allowing the
shaving of units.
Printup added that another
reason he decided to end shaving
of units was that the new Axess
could not take such an option
into account.
Student reaction to the
change, however, has been some
what critical.
Laura Elizabeth, a masters
student in computer science and
deputy chair of the Graduate
Student Council, said she wishes
she still had the option of shav
ing units.
"It made it possible to take
classes outside my program that
I happened to be interested in,"
she said.

"Unfortunately, most of the
classes outside my program
that I'd take for fun are under
grad-level classes and aren't of
fered for reduced units," Eliza
beth added.
Although the concept of shav
ing units was introduced to accom
modate graduate students, under
graduates also employed the prat -
tice. According to Printup, some
undergraduates abused the privi
lege to "get around a University
policy of a 20-unit maximum
course load."
"A course is offered fora partic
ular number of units fora reason,"
Printup said. "But if students are
doing less work, then they are not
doing what the course is described
as in the Stanford Bulletin."
But junior Sam Rang dis
agreed. "Everyone could have
shaved, and if a person took a
course for fewer units, then that
student was the only one getting
shortchanged," he said.
Rang, who shaved four units off
a five-unit Rorean language
course during spring quarter last
year, said he did the full live units'
worth of work. "1 did not mind
doing five units' worth of work be
cause I took the class to learn
something, not to receive one

unit's worth of credit," he said.
Some alternatives remain lot
students who wish to accommo
date more classes.
Printup pointed out that "some
courses in the Time Schedule are
offered for four to five units or
three to five units," and more lac
ulty members are gradually
changing the unit ranges of their
courses. In these cases, a student

who takes a c lass for fewer units is
assigned a lighter workload.
Another alternative is inde
pendent study or directed read
ing. Instead of doing more work
than a student receives credit for,
Printup said, "Independent study
or directed reading would be
more appropriate for what the
student has done as part of that
learning experience."
