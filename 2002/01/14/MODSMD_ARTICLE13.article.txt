## The 						Stanford Daily Teevens a sound choice for Stanford football 
### 
Published Since 1891

Last week, we outlined some sugges
tions for Athletic Director led Leland
to follow in choosing the new football
coach after the departure of Tyrone
Willingham for Notre Dame. We are happy to
report that new coach Buddy Teevens fits these
requirements well.
()ur first suggestion was that Leland choose
quickh to give the program stability for re
cruits. He certainly did so, announcing the
choice on Wednesday so that Teevens would be
on campus for this past weekend, when sever
al recruits came to visit.
We also advised that the new coach pro
vide continuity on offense and defense. On
offense, Teevens certainly meets this criteri
on. He previously worked at the University
of Florida as an assistant offensive coordina
tor. Florida ran a wide-open offense that

passed the ball often but also used running
plays effectively. Teevens's approach to of
fense seems somewhat different, but still fo
cused on the wide-open style that Stanford
successfully used this year, so he is well-po
sitioned to use Stanford's offensive talent:
quarterback Chris Lewis, wide receivers
Teyo Johnson, Luke Powell and Ryan Wells
and running back Kerry Carter. On de
fense, interior defensive line coach Dave
Tipton is staying at Stanford, which will en
sure some defensive overlap from last year's
team to this year's.
Finally, we suggested that the new coach
set high academic standards for the players
and follow all NCAA rules. Teevens seems
like an ideal candidate to meet this most im
portant requirement. Leland called
Teevens's personal integrity "a great fit for

[Stanford]," meaning he is unlikely to bend
or break any NCAA regulations. Teevens's
five years as head coach of Dartmouth
means that he has experience in a school
where academics are important. He under
stands the importance of academics to the
school, both in recruiting and for players al
ready on the team.
Our only qualm about Teevens is his lack of
success in coaching top-level college football
teams. During his five years as head coach of
Tulane, he averaged only two wins per season.
We hope that Teevens has the coaching skill to
lead Stanford's talent-laden teams to winning
seasons in the competitive Pacific 10 Confer
ence; so far in his career, he has not proven
that he has this skill.
Another positive for Teevens, though, is
his excitement and enthusiasm about taking

the job. He said he and his family were "ec
static" to be at Stanford. We encourage
Teevens to project this excitement to the
Stanford community: to involve students,
faculty, staff, alumni and local residents in
Stanford football. Teevens should introduce
as many people as possible to the successful
team and its entertaining games.
A great team like Stanford deserves
strong support from the fans. If Teevens
and the Athletic Department can foster this
excitement about football, fans will pack
Stanford Stadium for every home game, not
just Big Game.
Although Teevens will ultimately prove
himself in choosing assistant coaches, luring
top-notch recruits and most importantly, on
the field this fall, it seems initially that Ice
land chose wisely by selecting Teevens.
