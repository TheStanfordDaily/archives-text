# THAT SIDE OF PARADISE
## Clothes make the man 
### 
Willi the recent passing of Car
rie Donovan, the Vogue fash
ion (/.ir who was notorious for
het oversized sunglasses,
pearls and flambovant cameos on Old
Navy commercials, I cannot help but think
that Ms. Donovan would have been nause
ated by the stunted trends and the soporif
ic fashion here at Stanford.

Because even though I
grant Califbrnian attire
some leewa\ in the List
Judgement of Fashion,
the typical Stanford aes
thetic amounts to some
thing tar less permissible.
Indeed, the sociophysical
bubble in which Stanford
is beached is exacerbated

by our fashion vacuum as well. Had Ms.
Donovan entered it by taking a tour of our
campus by day < >r bv attending a (ireek func
tion by night, she would have found a brazen
showcase of misguided stvle neophytes.
I'll begin with Stanford females. La
moda for girls here is characterized by a
timid banality, and this can be attributed
to a couple of factors. I'he first thing that
hinders a girl's quest to be a fashionista is
the idea that Stanford is the alleged an
tithesis of pretentious SoCal pixieism.
Thus, any particularly bewitching outfit
that is too material or just too visible will
invariably draw disdain from one's con
temporaries. 112 he female undergrad
must constantly reconcile her desire to
look really good with her fear of alienat
ing her peers in the process.
And so ultimately, the daily result of this
quandar) is an unexciting ensemble with
only the occasional token edge-of-the-en
velope accessory. A testimony to this phe
nomenon is that those Euromaidens who
prance around in lovely full-body Prada
have become notorious for their excess.
I litis, excepting the occasional anomaly,
imaginative vogue has become subverted
by Stanford < ulture.
Secondly, the physical expanse of our
school and the requisite daily intrac ampus
trekking discourages über-ccx>l footwear
sported by, for example, Carrie on "Sex
and the ( ity," because it is too uncomfort
able. Many women would argue that shoes
make or break an outfit, and because allur
ing sandals or stilettos cannot Ik- sported
because theii treacherousness, girls then
allow comfort trump fashion in other areas
of their wardrobe as well.
It is alsc) important to draw attention to
the prevailing misconception that a silver
Tiffany act essor> is the perfec I ending to an
outfit. Ciii ls seem to think that simply be
cause their ensemble includes one piece
made by hlsa Perreti, they can get away
with fashion murder on the rest of their
person. Tiffany is not original, let alone vin
dication for tragic garb.
I here also seems to be a persistent
abundance of denim jac kets, most notably
on the ladies of h Beta Phi, ostensibly to
achieve an ironic revival look, l earn Pi Phi
should stop complaining that the weather

has gotten so cold if all they're wearing is a
jean jacket over a pink tube top. Like, trade
that stuff in for some Patagonia.
Males at Stanford are even more careless
with their garb. Even if the girls are averse
to dressing like conspicuous fashionistas or
are restrained by Stanford's physical layout,
the boys here have no such excuse, and are
shamelessly indiscriminate with what they
wear. With the except ion of the occasional
ex-bearded flitting around school in
Armani linen shirts and capri pants or the
even more rare stubborn ribbon-belt wear
ing prep schooler, all Stanford males dress
as though they are on a boardwalk in New
Jersey or San 1 )iego. Sadly, you can take the
boy out of the surf...
Further, a formal event in the real world
requires that men wear black tie. Also
known as a tuxedo. What all of you rented
for your razzle-dazzle proms. But at Stan
find, the school with a dumbed-down fash
ion code, a formal entails a shirt and tie. A
blazer, which is semiformal in the real
world, is not even included in the protocol
fora Stanford formal.
And then we have other dominant
trends, such as the shorts-cum-pants phe
nomenon. Nearly every undergraduate
male seems to parade around in these
transformation trousers, ignoring the fact
that they are utilitarian to the point of ab
surdity. I invented and personally sewed
a pair of these combination shorts/ pants
when I was in first grade for my school's
annual Young Inventors competition,
and I finished in last place, so you can
imagine how redonkulous 1 find their re
cent popularity.
I he widespread marvel of the Aber
c rombieand Fitch clothingbrand is equal
ly baffling. The coeds of Stanford have
blindly invested hundreds of dollars in
Aberfratty's cargo pocketed line, and our
school is now a homogenous mass of
ribbed-sweater clones. Perhaps it is A &
F's smutty advertising that dupes these
boys into thinking that they too can have
an orgy with seven blond anorexics if they
wear Abercrombie faux-ratty, previously
faded sport shirts. But in truth, if the
clothes don't even look good on the mod
els— and they don't — they certainly
won't look good on the plebes.
Then there is the general ignorama that
fogs Stanfcn d's collective fashion conscious
ness. So to clarify: Lily Pulitzer is not the
woman for whom the Pulitzer Prize is
named. Burberry is not a seeded fruit. |.
Press is not a subsidiary of J. Crew. Thomas
Pink is not a producer living in Malibu.
And then there's always the athlete fac -
tor. Stanford's c ampus culture is so domi
nated by our athletic teams that gray sweat
clothing is übiquitous in the classroom. The
most obvious perpetrators are fcx>tball
players, who are so smitten with their ex
tracurricular vocation that they will often
don not only a gray Stanford sweatshirt but
matching Stanford sweatpants as well, and
will then accessorize with a Stanford Cardi
