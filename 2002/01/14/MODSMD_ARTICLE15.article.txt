LAS changes clarified
The hope expressed in the Daily edito
rial of Jan. 10 that studies of Latin Ameri
ca at Stanford will be sustained at the high
est level is welcome — and widely shared.
This goal has the full support of the H&S
Dean's office and of the university admin
istration, which intends no slackening of
commitment to area and comparative in
ternational studies.
Given the structural realities of Stan
ford, I think a distinction needs to be made
between scholarship concerning topics
Latin American, which takes place in many
venues on campus, and the MA and BA de
gree programs situated in the Latin Amer
ican Studies Inter-Departmental Program
that have been part of the program of the
Center for Latin American Studies.
Faculty with research and teaching in
terests in Latin America are at work in over
a dozen departments and in several
schools at the University. Among these are
scholars recently attracted to Stanford.
( The editorial writer is mistaken: none of
their positions is affected by decisions re
garding degree programs in lAS, and no
loss of faculty results from these actions).
Research and teaching in the field of Uitin
American studies proceeds. The Center
for Latin American Studies in Bolivar
House also proceeds with its usual pro
grams and activities, which include (in ad
dition to academic courses) the research
done by Visiting Scholars and the presen
tation of regular seminars and symposia.
IDPs are created by the Faculty Senate
and periodically evaluated according to
standards used by the Senate to assess per
formance of all IDPs. The decisions of
three University committees (composed of
faculty and students) to discontinue in lAS
the MA and BA degrees in their present
forms have disappointed current and
prospeclive students.
These decisions were not made, howev
er, out of disregard for or with a view to de
valuing American studies or area
studies. Rather, these judgments reflect
the conviction that studies in this discipline

can be strengthened, and that those facul
ty engaged in (II AS should take time to re
consider lAS auricular offerings.
Last month Prof. Jim Fox of Anthropo
logical Sciences assumed the Directorship
of CIAS. Ile has among his priorities the
broadening and deepening of engage
ment of Stanford faculty members in the
Center's activities as well as a reconsidera
tion of the degree programs that lAS
should fashion and offer. Those who are
concerned about the future of Latin Amer
ican studies at the University and hope for
the best p<>ssible opp<>rt unities for both stu
dents and faculty drawn to this field will
wish Prof. Fox and CIAS much success at
this promising juncture.

Tresidder improvements 'a must 7
I his letter serves as a clarification to Fri
day's Daily Editorial entitled, "Stanford
not suited for proposed student centers." I
applaud the Daily for making a number of
very realistic and important points about
student life at Stanford. Namely, students
should spend a great deal of time meeting
and relaxing with friends in dormitory set
tings. Stanford is a residential community
with a large emphasis on dorm life and
dorm-sponsored activities.
Like my colleagues, 1 wholeheartedly
endorse the residential community, dorm
activities and improved services at Tresid
der. As a caveat, this letter only highlights
reflections of what 1 have personally been
involved while an ASSU Undergraduate
Senator; other elected officials or Senators
could comment on an array of separate en
deavors they are working on to improve
services at Tresidder or around campus.
I he Daily's editorial suggests that more
convenient services ought to exist within
Tresidder — a pizza place with late hours,
a grocery store with reasonable prices and
well thought out student space. We com

pletely agree. Bon Appetit's managers, my
self and others have already begun con
sulting, and over the next 12 months, im
provements will be made to the existing
services at 1 residder. Substantial changes
will be made to the ambiance of the eatery
on the first floor of Tresidder to make it
more comfortable for hanging out and
studying. 1 here will be a sizable overhaul
of the food and drink services at Java City,
the Corner Pocket and the food court.
I here will also be additions made to the
food options at the Coffee I louse.
Moreover, over my two years in the
ASSU Senate, we have pushed for more
events to bring the larger campus to
gether in a social atmosphere, much like
the residential and dorm activities. With
the co-sponsorship of the Stanford Con
cert Network and the Office of Student
Activities, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate has put on a series of "Student
Nights (a I residder" with free music
and food. I hose activities serve to bring
students together who would otherwise
not meet one another because they live
on opposite sides of campus.
I liese events will continue this quarter.
I his coming I hursday (1/17) and two and
a half weeks from now (1/31), the Stanford
Concert Network and ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate will be partnering again to put on
two Student Nights." Hie concert network
will have OM Irio and len lon Chicken
playing in the CoHo, while the Senate will
Ik* handing out 100 dozen Krispy Kreme
donuLs each night for free.
Finally, with respect to the concept of a
new student union, we are currently
putting together a proposal for submission
to top administrators. While we completely
understand the limitations of space on cam
pus and the demands on administration, we
are simultaneously aware of the shortcom
ings of I residder. While Tresidder pro
vides a number of services and continues to
improve upon those, it remains a "union"
and not a student union." Tresidder is a
money-making enterprise that services the
entire Stanford community; no true student
union currently exists at Stanford. More
over, 1 residder is almost 30 years old, so has
limitations for what new services can be
brought in.
No new student union proposal is cur
rently on the agenda for the General Use
Permit. ()ur proposal aims to make the ad
ministration aware of this shortcoming. We
openly admit that a new student union is not
in the near future. It is impractical and lo
gisticall) impossible for the University to
build such a facility in the next few years.
()ur aim, however, is to make such an inter
est known so that 10-15 years from now,
when I residder's abilities are truly obsolete,
we are not left in the dark.
In the interim, additions to existing ser
vices are a must.

Separating 'good science from bad'
When I went to high school, my biology
teacher was required to expose us to both
the Fvolutionist and the Creationist point
ol view. For this reason, a single morning
(of many years of biology) was spent at
tending a seminar that was designed to ex
pose children to creationism. In a room
containing hundreds of other students, I
think that our class was the only one from a
school that was not affiliated with a partic
ular religion.
From what I remember, the keynote ad
dress was given by some geologist with an
affiliation to UC-Berkeley and one of his
c laims was that the existence and geology
of the (.rand (lanyon supports the point of
view that the Great Flood occurred a few
thousand years ago. The talk also featured
slides of the Mount St. Helens explosion,
but I c annot remember how those fit into
his great scheme of things. We were hand
ed a program for other talks that would

occur during the week and one of those
had a title similar to "Dinosaurs: How do
they lit into the Bible?" From looking at
their skeletons in museums and watching
"Jurassic Park," I would conclude that most
would probably not lit into the Bible since
they are too big.
It is important to separate good science
from bad science. It is always possible to find
scientists that have opposing points of view
However, not all points of view are support
ed by good science and thus these only rep
resent the ideas of a minority of scientists.
Unfortunately, some of the ideas that are
supported only by bad science may find a
following in people that are swayed by par
ticularly charismatic speakers that provide
the "answers" that these people want to
hear. One way not to believe in evolution is
to be blinded into thinking that all we need
to know is the literal interpretation of the
Bible instead of studying the great, dynam
ic Universe that surrounds us.
You claim that authentic science poses
substantial problems for the theory that hu
mans evolved from molecules. What do
you mean by "authentic" science? As far as
I know, we are still made of molecules. 11
you do not think that DNAcan change, just
look at the processes that lead to the emer
gence of microorganisms that resist our lat
est antibiotics. Surely, this is an example of
evolution and Darwin's principle of the sur
vival of the fittest. Although, I guess that
you could propose that demonic lore es con
stantly unleash these antibiotic-resistant
bacteria on humanity.
It is possible that an all-powerful, all
knowing Ciod could have created the Uni
verse a few thousand years ago (or a mini
mum of 27 years ago as far as it would con
cern me) and made it seem as if it is billions
of years old (and plant a lew dinosaur skele
tons here and there). It is also possible that
Ciod created the processes that gave rise to
the Universe as we know it and that the liv
ing things you see today are some of the re
sults of these processes clue to something
called evolution. Perhaps, there is no (iod.
Keep an open mind, seek the truth and
try to trust your fellow scientists. Sure, we
are fallible, but we do the best job that we
can to keep our mistakes to an absolute

minimum.
P.S. Pails of the immune system are rela
tively redundant. The appendix is also part
ol the immune system. I lowever, it appears
to lx' much more important in certain ani
mals than in humans. We do not need our
appendix and a burst appendix can be
catastrophic. We also do not absolutely need
our tonsils for normal everyday life, but hav
ing them is good thing.

Creafionism letter 'flawed'
Stephen Doane's Jan. 11 letter support
ing creationism contained several substan
tially flawed arguments. Most scientists I
know would be inclined to iterate through
Doane's points and systematically reiiite
them. 1 lowever, I think it is counterproduc
tive to argue on the scientific justification for
a materialistic worldview. Doane is disin
clined to believe in a universe without pur
pose. and no amount of evidence will shake
him ol this belief. Nevertheless, it is still pos
sible to conclusively disprove his claim that it
"now requires even more faith to believe in
the Darwinian theory of origins than it did
when Darwin first proposed his ideas." His
claim is patently wrong because evolution in
the Darwinian sense is no longer a part of
pure science alone, but is now a tool of main
stream engineering.
Permit me to explain. Historically, scien
tific I act alone has been interesting but ig
norable. Proving that the earth revolves
around the sun or that electrons have both
a particle and a wave nature may put the
philosophers into a tizzy, but the man on the
street may salelv ignore or even repudiate
such discoveries as the) have no measurable
ellecton hisdaiK life. I lowever. once a satel
lite is sent into orbit or the atomic: bomb is
dropped, the tangible reality becomes im
possible to discount. Once science becomes
engineering it can no longer be denied.
Recent developments in computer sci
ence have conclusively shown that Dar
winian evolution is an outstanding tool for
solving cliilicnit optimization problems.

Stanford's John Koza is a pioneer in this
field and was the founder of the theory of
Genetic Programming, which spawned a
host of offshoots that fall under the um
brella of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).
Without going into technical details, the
key idea is that of producing a set of can
didate solutions (a generation) that ex
hibits genetic variation. It is in turn sub
jected to natural selection to produce the
next generation. Once many thousands of
generations have been produced (in frac
tions of seconds on a computer), the mem
bers of the final generation are the solu
tions to our optimization problem.
For example, if our goal was to maximize
the load-bearing capacity of a three-piece
crane arm, we might apply this technique by
coding the positions of the arm's compo
nents as bits. The collection of all such posi
tions would be the genome of the arm, and
would be a full description of the arm. At
each generation we could selectively "kill"
those arms that were weak load bearers and
allow those that were strong bearers to re
produce, mixing and matching genetic
components to produce offspring with in
termediate characteristics. Repetition
would eventually give crane arms that were
highly optimized for load bearing. This
technique has been applied to solve chal
lenging problems in numerous non-biolog
ical areas, including analog circuit design,
optimal resource allocation, controller syn
thesis, investment strategy and many more.
The interested reader can follow this up on
Koza's web page.
These algorithms are able to solve com
plicated problems on which conventional
optimization methods choke. And the rea
son they can solve them is because they are
based on natural selection. If Darwinian
evolution was as unreasonable as its cre
ationist detractors claim it to be, EAs would
not be highly efficient optimization tools.
And if Mr. Doane (a chemical engineer)
was as open minded as he claims to be, he
would not discount evolution while using
evolutionary algorithms to design his lat
est reactor.

Separating 'good science from bad'
When I went to high school, my biology
teacher was required to expose us to both
the Fvolutionist and the Creationist point
ol view. For this reason, a single morning
(of many years of biology) was spent at
tending a seminar that was designed to ex
pose children to creationism. In a room
containing hundreds of other students, I
think that our class was the only one from a
school that was not affiliated with a partic
ular religion.
From what I remember, the keynote ad
dress was given by some geologist with an
affiliation to UC-Berkeley and one of his
c laims was that the existence and geology
of the (.rand (lanyon supports the point of
view that the Great Flood occurred a few
thousand years ago. The talk also featured
slides of the Mount St. Helens explosion,
but I c annot remember how those fit into
his great scheme of things. We were hand
ed a program for other talks that would

occur during the week and one of those
had a title similar to "Dinosaurs: How do
they lit into the Bible?" From looking at
their skeletons in museums and watching
"Jurassic Park," I would conclude that most
would probably not lit into the Bible since
they are too big.
It is important to separate good science
from bad science. It is always possible to find
scientists that have opposing points of view
However, not all points of view are support
ed by good science and thus these only rep
resent the ideas of a minority of scientists.
Unfortunately, some of the ideas that are
supported only by bad science may find a
following in people that are swayed by par
ticularly charismatic speakers that provide
the "answers" that these people want to
hear. One way not to believe in evolution is
to be blinded into thinking that all we need
to know is the literal interpretation of the
Bible instead of studying the great, dynam
ic Universe that surrounds us.
You claim that authentic science poses
substantial problems for the theory that hu
mans evolved from molecules. What do
you mean by "authentic" science? As far as
I know, we are still made of molecules. 11
you do not think that DNAcan change, just
look at the processes that lead to the emer
gence of microorganisms that resist our lat
est antibiotics. Surely, this is an example of
evolution and Darwin's principle of the sur
vival of the fittest. Although, I guess that
you could propose that demonic lore es con
stantly unleash these antibiotic-resistant
bacteria on humanity.
It is possible that an all-powerful, all
knowing Ciod could have created the Uni
verse a few thousand years ago (or a mini
mum of 27 years ago as far as it would con
cern me) and made it seem as if it is billions
of years old (and plant a lew dinosaur skele
tons here and there). It is also possible that
Ciod created the processes that gave rise to
the Universe as we know it and that the liv
ing things you see today are some of the re
sults of these processes clue to something
called evolution. Perhaps, there is no (iod.
Keep an open mind, seek the truth and
try to trust your fellow scientists. Sure, we
are fallible, but we do the best job that we
can to keep our mistakes to an absolute

minimum.
P.S. Pails of the immune system are rela
tively redundant. The appendix is also part
ol the immune system. I lowever, it appears
to lx' much more important in certain ani
mals than in humans. We do not need our
appendix and a burst appendix can be
catastrophic. We also do not absolutely need
our tonsils for normal everyday life, but hav
ing them is good thing.

Creafionism letter 'flawed'
Stephen Doane's Jan. 11 letter support
ing creationism contained several substan
tially flawed arguments. Most scientists I
know would be inclined to iterate through
Doane's points and systematically reiiite
them. 1 lowever, I think it is counterproduc
tive to argue on the scientific justification for
a materialistic worldview. Doane is disin
clined to believe in a universe without pur
pose. and no amount of evidence will shake
him ol this belief. Nevertheless, it is still pos
sible to conclusively disprove his claim that it
"now requires even more faith to believe in
the Darwinian theory of origins than it did
when Darwin first proposed his ideas." His
claim is patently wrong because evolution in
the Darwinian sense is no longer a part of
pure science alone, but is now a tool of main
stream engineering.
Permit me to explain. Historically, scien
tific I act alone has been interesting but ig
norable. Proving that the earth revolves
around the sun or that electrons have both
a particle and a wave nature may put the
philosophers into a tizzy, but the man on the
street may salelv ignore or even repudiate
such discoveries as the) have no measurable
ellecton hisdaiK life. I lowever. once a satel
lite is sent into orbit or the atomic: bomb is
dropped, the tangible reality becomes im
possible to discount. Once science becomes
engineering it can no longer be denied.
Recent developments in computer sci
ence have conclusively shown that Dar
winian evolution is an outstanding tool for
solving cliilicnit optimization problems.

Stanford's John Koza is a pioneer in this
field and was the founder of the theory of
Genetic Programming, which spawned a
host of offshoots that fall under the um
brella of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).
Without going into technical details, the
key idea is that of producing a set of can
didate solutions (a generation) that ex
hibits genetic variation. It is in turn sub
jected to natural selection to produce the
next generation. Once many thousands of
generations have been produced (in frac
tions of seconds on a computer), the mem
bers of the final generation are the solu
tions to our optimization problem.
For example, if our goal was to maximize
the load-bearing capacity of a three-piece
crane arm, we might apply this technique by
coding the positions of the arm's compo
nents as bits. The collection of all such posi
tions would be the genome of the arm, and
would be a full description of the arm. At
each generation we could selectively "kill"
those arms that were weak load bearers and
allow those that were strong bearers to re
produce, mixing and matching genetic
components to produce offspring with in
termediate characteristics. Repetition
would eventually give crane arms that were
highly optimized for load bearing. This
technique has been applied to solve chal
lenging problems in numerous non-biolog
ical areas, including analog circuit design,
optimal resource allocation, controller syn
thesis, investment strategy and many more.
The interested reader can follow this up on
Koza's web page.
These algorithms are able to solve com
plicated problems on which conventional
optimization methods choke. And the rea
son they can solve them is because they are
based on natural selection. If Darwinian
evolution was as unreasonable as its cre
ationist detractors claim it to be, EAs would
not be highly efficient optimization tools.
And if Mr. Doane (a chemical engineer)
was as open minded as he claims to be, he
would not discount evolution while using
evolutionary algorithms to design his lat
est reactor.

Creafionism letter 'flawed'
Stephen Doane's Jan. 11 letter support
ing creationism contained several substan
tially flawed arguments. Most scientists I
know would be inclined to iterate through
Doane's points and systematically reiiite
them. 1 lowever, I think it is counterproduc
tive to argue on the scientific justification for
a materialistic worldview. Doane is disin
clined to believe in a universe without pur
pose. and no amount of evidence will shake
him ol this belief. Nevertheless, it is still pos
sible to conclusively disprove his claim that it
"now requires even more faith to believe in
the Darwinian theory of origins than it did
when Darwin first proposed his ideas." His
claim is patently wrong because evolution in
the Darwinian sense is no longer a part of
pure science alone, but is now a tool of main
stream engineering.
Permit me to explain. Historically, scien
tific I act alone has been interesting but ig
norable. Proving that the earth revolves
around the sun or that electrons have both
a particle and a wave nature may put the
philosophers into a tizzy, but the man on the
street may salelv ignore or even repudiate
such discoveries as the) have no measurable
ellecton hisdaiK life. I lowever. once a satel
lite is sent into orbit or the atomic: bomb is
dropped, the tangible reality becomes im
possible to discount. Once science becomes
engineering it can no longer be denied.
Recent developments in computer sci
ence have conclusively shown that Dar
winian evolution is an outstanding tool for
solving cliilicnit optimization problems.

Stanford's John Koza is a pioneer in this
field and was the founder of the theory of
Genetic Programming, which spawned a
host of offshoots that fall under the um
brella of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).
Without going into technical details, the
key idea is that of producing a set of can
didate solutions (a generation) that ex
hibits genetic variation. It is in turn sub
jected to natural selection to produce the
next generation. Once many thousands of
generations have been produced (in frac
tions of seconds on a computer), the mem
bers of the final generation are the solu
tions to our optimization problem.
For example, if our goal was to maximize
the load-bearing capacity of a three-piece
crane arm, we might apply this technique by
coding the positions of the arm's compo
nents as bits. The collection of all such posi
tions would be the genome of the arm, and
would be a full description of the arm. At
each generation we could selectively "kill"
those arms that were weak load bearers and
allow those that were strong bearers to re
produce, mixing and matching genetic
components to produce offspring with in
termediate characteristics. Repetition
would eventually give crane arms that were
highly optimized for load bearing. This
technique has been applied to solve chal
lenging problems in numerous non-biolog
ical areas, including analog circuit design,
optimal resource allocation, controller syn
thesis, investment strategy and many more.
The interested reader can follow this up on
Koza's web page.
These algorithms are able to solve com
plicated problems on which conventional
optimization methods choke. And the rea
son they can solve them is because they are
based on natural selection. If Darwinian
evolution was as unreasonable as its cre
ationist detractors claim it to be, EAs would
not be highly efficient optimization tools.
And if Mr. Doane (a chemical engineer)
was as open minded as he claims to be, he
would not discount evolution while using
evolutionary algorithms to design his lat
est reactor.

Tresidder improvements 'a must 7
I his letter serves as a clarification to Fri
day's Daily Editorial entitled, "Stanford
not suited for proposed student centers." I
applaud the Daily for making a number of
very realistic and important points about
student life at Stanford. Namely, students
should spend a great deal of time meeting
and relaxing with friends in dormitory set
tings. Stanford is a residential community
with a large emphasis on dorm life and
dorm-sponsored activities.
Like my colleagues, 1 wholeheartedly
endorse the residential community, dorm
activities and improved services at Tresid
der. As a caveat, this letter only highlights
reflections of what 1 have personally been
involved while an ASSU Undergraduate
Senator; other elected officials or Senators
could comment on an array of separate en
deavors they are working on to improve
services at Tresidder or around campus.
I he Daily's editorial suggests that more
convenient services ought to exist within
Tresidder — a pizza place with late hours,
a grocery store with reasonable prices and
well thought out student space. We com

pletely agree. Bon Appetit's managers, my
self and others have already begun con
sulting, and over the next 12 months, im
provements will be made to the existing
services at 1 residder. Substantial changes
will be made to the ambiance of the eatery
on the first floor of Tresidder to make it
more comfortable for hanging out and
studying. 1 here will be a sizable overhaul
of the food and drink services at Java City,
the Corner Pocket and the food court.
I here will also be additions made to the
food options at the Coffee I louse.
Moreover, over my two years in the
ASSU Senate, we have pushed for more
events to bring the larger campus to
gether in a social atmosphere, much like
the residential and dorm activities. With
the co-sponsorship of the Stanford Con
cert Network and the Office of Student
Activities, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate has put on a series of "Student
Nights (a I residder" with free music
and food. I hose activities serve to bring
students together who would otherwise
not meet one another because they live
on opposite sides of campus.
I liese events will continue this quarter.
I his coming I hursday (1/17) and two and

playing in the CoHo, while the Senate will
Ik* handing out 100 dozen Krispy Kreme

Finally, with respect to the concept of a
new student union, we are currently
putting together a proposal for submission
to top administrators. While we completely
understand the limitations of space on cam
pus and the demands on administration, we
are simultaneously aware of the shortcom

money-making enterprise that services the
entire Stanford community; no true student
union currently exists at Stanford. More
over, 1 residder is almost 30 years old, so has
limitations for what new services can be
brought in.
No new student union proposal is cur

Separating 'good science from bad'
When I went to high school, my biology
teacher was required to expose us to both
the Fvolutionist and the Creationist point
ol view. For this reason, a single morning
(of many years of biology) was spent at
tending a seminar that was designed to ex
pose children to creationism. In a room
containing hundreds of other students, I
think that our class was the only one from a
school that was not affiliated with a partic
ular religion.
From what I remember, the keynote ad
dress was given by some geologist with an
affiliation to UC-Berkeley and one of his
c laims was that the existence and geology
of the (.rand (lanyon supports the point of
view that the Great Flood occurred a few
thousand years ago. The talk also featured
slides of the Mount St. Helens explosion,
but I c annot remember how those fit into
his great scheme of things. We were hand

occur during the week and one of those
had a title similar to "Dinosaurs: How do

produce, mixing and matching genetic
components to produce offspring with in

would eventually give crane arms that were

The hope expressed in the Daily edito
rial of Jan. 10 that studies of Latin Ameri
ca at Stanford will be sustained at the high
est level is welcome — and widely shared.
This goal has the full support of the H&S
Dean's office and of the university admin
istration, which intends no slackening of
commitment to area and comparative in
ternational studies.
Given the structural realities of Stan
ford, I think a distinction needs to be made
between scholarship concerning topics
Latin American, which takes place in many
venues on campus, and the MA and BA de
gree programs situated in the Latin Amer
ican Studies Inter-Departmental Program
that have been part of the program of the
Center for Latin American Studies.
Faculty with research and teaching in
terests in Latin America are at work in over
a dozen departments and in several
schools at the University. Among these are
scholars recently attracted to Stanford.
( The editorial writer is mistaken: none of
their positions is affected by decisions re
garding degree programs in lAS, and no
loss of faculty results from these actions).
Research and teaching in the field of Uitin
American studies proceeds. The Center
for Latin American Studies in Bolivar
House also proceeds with its usual pro
grams and activities, which include (in ad
dition to academic courses) the research
done by Visiting Scholars and the presen
tation of regular seminars and symposia.
IDPs are created by the Faculty Senate
and periodically evaluated according to
standards used by the Senate to assess per
formance of all IDPs. The decisions of
three University committees (composed of
faculty and students) to discontinue in lAS
the MA and BA degrees in their present
forms have disappointed current and
prospeclive students.
These decisions were not made, howev
er, out of disregard for or with a view to de
valuing American studies or area
studies. Rather, these judgments reflect
the conviction that studies in this discipline

can be strengthened, and that those facul
ty engaged in (II AS should take time to re
consider lAS auricular offerings.
Last month Prof. Jim Fox of Anthropo
logical Sciences assumed the Directorship
of CIAS. Ile has among his priorities the
broadening and deepening of engage
ment of Stanford faculty members in the
Center's activities as well as a reconsidera
tion of the degree programs that lAS
should fashion and offer. Those who are
concerned about the future of Latin Amer
ican studies at the University and hope for
the best p<>ssible opp<>rt unities for both stu
dents and faculty drawn to this field will
wish Prof. Fox and CIAS much success at
this promising juncture.

Tresidder improvements 'a must 7
I his letter serves as a clarification to Fri
day's Daily Editorial entitled, "Stanford
not suited for proposed student centers." I
applaud the Daily for making a number of
very realistic and important points about
student life at Stanford. Namely, students
should spend a great deal of time meeting
and relaxing with friends in dormitory set
tings. Stanford is a residential community
with a large emphasis on dorm life and
dorm-sponsored activities.
Like my colleagues, 1 wholeheartedly
endorse the residential community, dorm
activities and improved services at Tresid
der. As a caveat, this letter only highlights
reflections of what 1 have personally been
involved while an ASSU Undergraduate
Senator; other elected officials or Senators
could comment on an array of separate en
deavors they are working on to improve
services at Tresidder or around campus.
I he Daily's editorial suggests that more
convenient services ought to exist within
Tresidder — a pizza place with late hours,
a grocery store with reasonable prices and
well thought out student space. We com

pletely agree. Bon Appetit's managers, my
self and others have already begun con
sulting, and over the next 12 months, im
provements will be made to the existing
services at 1 residder. Substantial changes
will be made to the ambiance of the eatery
on the first floor of Tresidder to make it
more comfortable for hanging out and
studying. 1 here will be a sizable overhaul
of the food and drink services at Java City,
the Corner Pocket and the food court.
I here will also be additions made to the
food options at the Coffee I louse.
Moreover, over my two years in the
ASSU Senate, we have pushed for more
events to bring the larger campus to
gether in a social atmosphere, much like
the residential and dorm activities. With
the co-sponsorship of the Stanford Con
cert Network and the Office of Student
Activities, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate has put on a series of "Student
Nights (a I residder" with free music
and food. I hose activities serve to bring
students together who would otherwise
not meet one another because they live
on opposite sides of campus.
I liese events will continue this quarter.
I his coming I hursday (1/17) and two and
a half weeks from now (1/31), the Stanford
Concert Network and ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate will be partnering again to put on
two Student Nights." Hie concert network
will have OM Irio and len lon Chicken
playing in the CoHo, while the Senate will
Ik* handing out 100 dozen Krispy Kreme
donuLs each night for free.
Finally, with respect to the concept of a
new student union, we are currently
putting together a proposal for submission
to top administrators. While we completely
understand the limitations of space on cam
pus and the demands on administration, we
are simultaneously aware of the shortcom
ings of I residder. While Tresidder pro
vides a number of services and continues to
improve upon those, it remains a "union"
and not a student union." Tresidder is a
money-making enterprise that services the
entire Stanford community; no true student
union currently exists at Stanford. More
over, 1 residder is almost 30 years old, so has
limitations for what new services can be
brought in.
No new student union proposal is cur
rently on the agenda for the General Use
Permit. ()ur proposal aims to make the ad
ministration aware of this shortcoming. We
openly admit that a new student union is not
in the near future. It is impractical and lo
gisticall) impossible for the University to
build such a facility in the next few years.
()ur aim, however, is to make such an inter
est known so that 10-15 years from now,
when I residder's abilities are truly obsolete,
we are not left in the dark.
In the interim, additions to existing ser
vices are a must.

Separating 'good science from bad'
When I went to high school, my biology
teacher was required to expose us to both
the Fvolutionist and the Creationist point
ol view. For this reason, a single morning
(of many years of biology) was spent at
tending a seminar that was designed to ex
pose children to creationism. In a room
containing hundreds of other students, I
think that our class was the only one from a
school that was not affiliated with a partic
ular religion.
From what I remember, the keynote ad
dress was given by some geologist with an
affiliation to UC-Berkeley and one of his
c laims was that the existence and geology
of the (.rand (lanyon supports the point of
view that the Great Flood occurred a few
thousand years ago. The talk also featured
slides of the Mount St. Helens explosion,
but I c annot remember how those fit into
his great scheme of things. We were hand
ed a program for other talks that would

occur during the week and one of those
had a title similar to "Dinosaurs: How do
they lit into the Bible?" From looking at
their skeletons in museums and watching
"Jurassic Park," I would conclude that most
would probably not lit into the Bible since
they are too big.
It is important to separate good science
from bad science. It is always possible to find
scientists that have opposing points of view
However, not all points of view are support
ed by good science and thus these only rep
resent the ideas of a minority of scientists.
Unfortunately, some of the ideas that are
supported only by bad science may find a
following in people that are swayed by par
ticularly charismatic speakers that provide
the "answers" that these people want to
hear. One way not to believe in evolution is
to be blinded into thinking that all we need
to know is the literal interpretation of the
Bible instead of studying the great, dynam
ic Universe that surrounds us.
You claim that authentic science poses
substantial problems for the theory that hu
mans evolved from molecules. What do
you mean by "authentic" science? As far as
I know, we are still made of molecules. 11
you do not think that DNAcan change, just
look at the processes that lead to the emer
gence of microorganisms that resist our lat
est antibiotics. Surely, this is an example of
evolution and Darwin's principle of the sur
vival of the fittest. Although, I guess that
you could propose that demonic lore es con
stantly unleash these antibiotic-resistant
bacteria on humanity.
It is possible that an all-powerful, all
knowing Ciod could have created the Uni
verse a few thousand years ago (or a mini
mum of 27 years ago as far as it would con
cern me) and made it seem as if it is billions
of years old (and plant a lew dinosaur skele
tons here and there). It is also possible that
Ciod created the processes that gave rise to
the Universe as we know it and that the liv
ing things you see today are some of the re
sults of these processes clue to something
called evolution. Perhaps, there is no (iod.
Keep an open mind, seek the truth and
try to trust your fellow scientists. Sure, we
are fallible, but we do the best job that we
can to keep our mistakes to an absolute

minimum.
P.S. Pails of the immune system are rela
tively redundant. The appendix is also part
ol the immune system. I lowever, it appears
to lx' much more important in certain ani
mals than in humans. We do not need our
appendix and a burst appendix can be
catastrophic. We also do not absolutely need
our tonsils for normal everyday life, but hav
ing them is good thing.

Creafionism letter 'flawed'
Stephen Doane's Jan. 11 letter support
ing creationism contained several substan
tially flawed arguments. Most scientists I
know would be inclined to iterate through
Doane's points and systematically reiiite
them. 1 lowever, I think it is counterproduc
tive to argue on the scientific justification for
a materialistic worldview. Doane is disin
clined to believe in a universe without pur
pose. and no amount of evidence will shake
him ol this belief. Nevertheless, it is still pos
sible to conclusively disprove his claim that it
"now requires even more faith to believe in
the Darwinian theory of origins than it did
when Darwin first proposed his ideas." His
claim is patently wrong because evolution in
the Darwinian sense is no longer a part of
pure science alone, but is now a tool of main
stream engineering.
Permit me to explain. Historically, scien
tific I act alone has been interesting but ig
norable. Proving that the earth revolves
around the sun or that electrons have both
a particle and a wave nature may put the
philosophers into a tizzy, but the man on the
street may salelv ignore or even repudiate
such discoveries as the) have no measurable
ellecton hisdaiK life. I lowever. once a satel
lite is sent into orbit or the atomic: bomb is
dropped, the tangible reality becomes im
possible to discount. Once science becomes
engineering it can no longer be denied.
