LAS changes clarified
The hope expressed in the Daily edito
rial of Jan. 10 that studies of Latin Ameri
ca at Stanford will be sustained at the high
est level is welcome — and widely shared.
This goal has the full support of the H&S
Dean's office and of the university admin
istration, which intends no slackening of
commitment to area and comparative in
ternational studies.
Given the structural realities of Stan
ford, I think a distinction needs to be made
between scholarship concerning topics
Latin American, which takes place in many
venues on campus, and the MA and BA de
gree programs situated in the Latin Amer
ican Studies Inter-Departmental Program
that have been part of the program of the
Center for Latin American Studies.
Faculty with research and teaching in
terests in Latin America are at work in over
a dozen departments and in several
schools at the University. Among these are
scholars recently attracted to Stanford.
( The editorial writer is mistaken: none of
their positions is affected by decisions re
garding degree programs in lAS, and no
loss of faculty results from these actions).
Research and teaching in the field of Uitin
American studies proceeds. The Center
for Latin American Studies in Bolivar
House also proceeds with its usual pro
grams and activities, which include (in ad
dition to academic courses) the research
done by Visiting Scholars and the presen
tation of regular seminars and symposia.
IDPs are created by the Faculty Senate
and periodically evaluated according to
standards used by the Senate to assess per
formance of all IDPs. The decisions of
three University committees (composed of
faculty and students) to discontinue in lAS
the MA and BA degrees in their present
forms have disappointed current and
prospeclive students.
These decisions were not made, howev
er, out of disregard for or with a view to de
valuing American studies or area
studies. Rather, these judgments reflect
the conviction that studies in this discipline

can be strengthened, and that those facul
ty engaged in (II AS should take time to re
consider lAS auricular offerings.
Last month Prof. Jim Fox of Anthropo
logical Sciences assumed the Directorship
of CIAS. Ile has among his priorities the
broadening and deepening of engage
ment of Stanford faculty members in the
Center's activities as well as a reconsidera
tion of the degree programs that lAS
should fashion and offer. Those who are
concerned about the future of Latin Amer
ican studies at the University and hope for
the best p<>ssible opp<>rt unities for both stu
dents and faculty drawn to this field will
wish Prof. Fox and CIAS much success at
this promising juncture.

Tresidder improvements 'a must 7
I his letter serves as a clarification to Fri
day's Daily Editorial entitled, "Stanford
not suited for proposed student centers." I
applaud the Daily for making a number of
very realistic and important points about
student life at Stanford. Namely, students
should spend a great deal of time meeting
and relaxing with friends in dormitory set
tings. Stanford is a residential community
with a large emphasis on dorm life and
dorm-sponsored activities.
Like my colleagues, 1 wholeheartedly
endorse the residential community, dorm
activities and improved services at Tresid
der. As a caveat, this letter only highlights
reflections of what 1 have personally been
involved while an ASSU Undergraduate
Senator; other elected officials or Senators
could comment on an array of separate en
deavors they are working on to improve
services at Tresidder or around campus.
I he Daily's editorial suggests that more
convenient services ought to exist within
Tresidder — a pizza place with late hours,
a grocery store with reasonable prices and
well thought out student space. We com

pletely agree. Bon Appetit's managers, my
self and others have already begun con
sulting, and over the next 12 months, im
provements will be made to the existing
services at 1 residder. Substantial changes
will be made to the ambiance of the eatery
on the first floor of Tresidder to make it
more comfortable for hanging out and
studying. 1 here will be a sizable overhaul
of the food and drink services at Java City,
the Corner Pocket and the food court.
I here will also be additions made to the
food options at the Coffee I louse.
Moreover, over my two years in the
ASSU Senate, we have pushed for more
events to bring the larger campus to
gether in a social atmosphere, much like
the residential and dorm activities. With
the co-sponsorship of the Stanford Con
cert Network and the Office of Student
Activities, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate has put on a series of "Student
Nights (a I residder" with free music
and food. I hose activities serve to bring
students together who would otherwise
not meet one another because they live
on opposite sides of campus.
I liese events will continue this quarter.
I his coming I hursday (1/17) and two and
a half weeks from now (1/31), the Stanford
Concert Network and ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate will be partnering again to put on
two Student Nights." Hie concert network
will have OM Irio and len lon Chicken
playing in the CoHo, while the Senate will
Ik* handing out 100 dozen Krispy Kreme
donuLs each night for free.
Finally, with respect to the concept of a
new student union, we are currently
putting together a proposal for submission
to top administrators. While we completely
understand the limitations of space on cam
pus and the demands on administration, we
are simultaneously aware of the shortcom
ings of I residder. While Tresidder pro
vides a number of services and continues to
improve upon those, it remains a "union"
and not a student union." Tresidder is a
money-making enterprise that services the
