TERMIT BORDER POST, Gaza Strip (AP)
— The demolition of Palestinian homes has
prompted an internal debate in Israel: Critics
called it heavy-handed, while army comman
ders at this front-line outpost insisted yesterday
it was necessary to halt attacks and seal a smug
gling tunnel from Egypt.
Israel's military said it bulldozed 21 empty
buildings Thursday in Rafah, at the southern
end of the (>aza Strip, to prevent Palestinian gun
men from using them as cover to fire on Israeli
troops guarding the nearby border with Egypt.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suggested that
the adjacent Israeli-controlled strip along (he
Egyptian border might have to be expanded.
"Most of those buildings were empty and
they gave cover to those tunnels," he told for
eign journalists in Jerusalem. "The corridor
that we are having there doesn't allow us to
stop it, so maybe it should be a more basic and
serious solution there. Maybe by gaining some
land around there." 112 le did not elaborate.
Israeli Col. Shlomo Dagan charged that the
Palestinians have also been bringing in
weapons from tunnels that begin in Egypt, bur
row under the Israeli border post and emerge
in houses in Rafah.
These tunnels are being used to smuggle
weapons that are a strategic threat to all of Is
rael," Dagan said, adding that several tunnels
have been uncovered and filled in the past six
months. "We are doing whatever we can to

stop lilt- smugglers from doing their job."
Hut Palestinians, I.N. aid workers and an
Israeli human rights group disputed the Israeli
account. They said the buildings were not
empty, contending that more than (i() inhabit
ed dwellings were torn down, leaving (>()() peo
ple homeless.
With TV images showing children living in
leaky tents and refugees sifting through the re
mains of what the) s.iicl were t heir homes, some
Israeli politicians and commentators joined in
the criticism.
In Tel Aviv, demonstrators gathered in front
of the Defense Ministry' to protest the demoli
tions, which came a day after four Israeli soldiers
were killed by Palestinian attackers not far from
Rafah. The two assailants, who were killed, had
been residents of the Rafah refugee camp.
In an interview Sunday with the Qatari
based satellite television station Al-Jazeera,
Arafat said the Palestinian Authority had no
need to smuggle weapons.
"Israelis sell everything," he said. "II we
want weapons, we will buy from them.'
Arafat denied Israeli allegations that he was
getting arms from Iran:" I would like to ask the
Arab and Islamic World, 'Is it possible that
Iranian officials would send weapons to me.'
Speaking to foreign correspondents Sun
day. Sharon said his goal is "to reach a political
settlement which will lead to peace with the
Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world.
