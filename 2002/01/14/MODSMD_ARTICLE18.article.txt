SAN VICENTE DFLCAGUAN,
(Colombia (AP) — Stoking tears that
(Colombia's war w ill enter its bloodi
est phase, leftist relx'ls declared the
peace process over yesterday and
prepared to abandon the sale haven
that has served as headquarters lor
three years of negotiations.
Moments before the announce
ment by the Revolutionai v Armed
Forces of (Colombia, a military
warplane circled over the site of
the failed peace talks in the hamlet
of Los Pozos. Troops massed in
military bases across this South
American country, and even re
servists were called to duty, pre
pared to retake the guerrilla sanc
tuary, an area roughly twice the
si/e of New Jersey.
The government ceded the /one
to the rebels, known by their Span
ish acronym lAR( 1, as a condition to
start the peace talks and the rebels
had pledged to give it back if the
talks ended.
President Andres Pastrana,
meanwhile, met with armed forces
commander Gen. Fernando

I'apias at the presidential palace in
the capital, Bogota. There was no
statement from the government or
the military following the closed
door discussion.
Three years of talks have only
yielded squabbling, and at midnight
Saturday Pastrana's patience ap
peared to have worn out. He or
dered the insurgents to come up
with a viable peace offer or leave by
Monday night.
"The ultimatum . . . handed
down by the president changes
everything we have agreed upon
during the past three years and thus
closes all possibilities'for the current
process," said Simon Trinidad, a
FARG commander. Trinidad dici
not say exactly when his group
would withdraw from the towns in
the zone.
I lowever, he said the rebels had
been in contact with Fidel Gastro,
adding the Guban leader might be
able to break the impasse.
I lie swift turn of events indicates
Golombia's 38-year-old civil war
wliic h pits the U.S.-backed military

and a brutal right-wing paramilitary
group against the FARC and small
er guerrilla tactions will intensify-.
"The next six months are proba
bly going to be the bloodiest we've
seen," said Adam Isacson, an analyst
with the Center for International
Policy in Washington.
Residents of the safe haven's
main town were terrified the illegal
paramilitary force — which has se
cret links with some military units —
would enter the zone and begin ex
ecuting them, merely because they
have coexisted with the rebels.
U.S. Ambassador Anne Patter
son met with Pastrana yesterday
after the rebels announced their
pullout. The United States has
trained and equipped some Colom
bian military units, mostly for mis
sions against insurgents direcdy in
volved in the country's cocaine and
heroin trade.
1 lowever, the U.S. government
has lal)eled the FARC a terrorist or
ganization, leaving open the possi
bility it may later provide direct
counterinsurgency aid.
