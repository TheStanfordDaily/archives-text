### TERRY HURLBUTT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four minutes into the game on
Sunday afternoon, the scene at
Maples Pavilion was a familiar
one, but with a bit of a twist.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Sunday: No. 4 Stanford 91,
Oregon 76

I he score was 15-4, but for
once, Stanford was the one
behind.
The No. 4 women's basketball
team was facing a come-from-be
hind situation of fairly serious
proportions for the first time this
year in Pacific 10 Conference
play, making its eventual 91-76
victory over Oregon all the more
significant.
Sophomore Nicole Powell led
the way for Stanford, scoring a
game-high 23 points and pulling
down 21 rebounds, a new Stan
ford record. Powell, who is aver
aging a double-double this season,
was the Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year last season.
"Nicole had a monster game,"
said VanDerveer. "She does so
much for our team. She can play
with anyone [in the country] —
we know it, she knows it, and you
know it."
Oregon entered the game at
l()-(i overall and 5-2 in the Pac
-10. The Ducks were off to an ex
plosive start against a weak Cardi
nal /one defense that allowed
them to go 3-4 from behind the
three-point line in those first five
minutes.
Coupled with a Stanford of
fense that shot a dismal 1-8 from
the field during that same time
period, it is easy to understand
how the team found itself in unfa
miliar territory.
Fat ing a quick and prolific Ore

down and began to prove to itself
and to everyone else watching,
why it is undefeated in the Pac-10.

hopes of eventual victory by
calmly knocking down a three,
giving Stanford the lead for the
rest of the game.
Yamasaki finished with 12
points, 10 of which came in the
second half.
"It's a good win lor our team,"
YanDerveer said. "We're going to
have to work realh hard before we
play them again. We missed a lot of
good shots, so we had to win it with
rebounding, taking tare of the ball,
and our defense."

As if Powell's rebounding and
scoring totals weren't impressive
enough, her team leadership was
strikingly clear as well.
Powell helped share the point
guard position with freshmen
guards Kelley Suminski and Seb
nein kimyacioglu throughout the
game. Her efforts leading the of
fense spurred the Cardinal's transi
tion game in the first half—a
major factor in its comeback.
1 hough Stanford knows this
game highlighted its vulnerabili
ties, YanDerveer was pleased with
how her team handled itself.
" Today was a tournament-like
game," YanDerveer said. "All of
our team showed great poise and
determination. We have different
people stepping up each game.
It's fun."
