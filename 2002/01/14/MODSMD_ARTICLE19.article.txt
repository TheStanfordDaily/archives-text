Four minutes into the game on
Sunday afternoon, the scene at
Maples Pavilion was a familiar
one, but with a bit of a twist.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Sunday: No. 4 Stanford 91,
Oregon 76

I he score was 15-4, but for
once, Stanford was the one
behind.
The No. 4 women's basketball
team was facing a come-from-be
hind situation of fairly serious
proportions for the first time this
year in Pacific 10 Conference
play, making its eventual 91-76
victory over Oregon all the more
significant.
Sophomore Nicole Powell led
the way for Stanford, scoring a
game-high 23 points and pulling
down 21 rebounds, a new Stan
ford record. Powell, who is aver
aging a double-double this season,
was the Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year last season.

said VanDerveer. "She does so
much for our team. She can play
with anyone [in the country] —

them to go 3-4 from behind the
three-point line in those first five
minutes.
Coupled with a Stanford of
fense that shot a dismal 1-8 from
the field during that same time
period, it is easy to understand
how the team found itself in unfa
miliar territory.
Fat ing a quick and prolific Ore
gon backcourt that went 7 for I 1
behind the three-point line in the
first half, the Cardinal buckled
down and began to prove to itself
and to everyone else watching,
why it is undefeated in the Pac-10.
