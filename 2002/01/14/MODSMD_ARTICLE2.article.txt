# Retaliation lawsuit dismissed
## 
### NICHOLAS CHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Friday, a Santa ('lara County Supreme Court
Judge terminated tlie last part of a lawsuit against
Stanford when he dismissed a retaliation claim filed
by former Stanford medical student Barbara Albert.
The lawsuit stemmed from, but was not a part of,
a sexual harassment claim made by Zylbert against a
Stanford professor more than 10 years ago.
The first part of Zylbert's claims against Stan
lord alleged that the University breached obliga
tions to protect her career after she graduated. Last
month, the court dismissed these claims as being
without merit.
"Her final claim against Stanford was that she had
been retaliated against by Stanford," University Gen
eral Counsel I)ebra Xumwalt said. "The court last
week threw that claim out as saying there was no ev
idence to support that."
According to a Stanford press release, "This [deci
sion] completely disposes of Dr. Zylbert's claims
against Stanford and confirms what has been Stan
ford's position from the beginning of this litiga
tion â€” that Stanford acted appropriately in its treat
ment of Dr. Zylbert and did nothing wrong."
In 1991, Zylbert was a student at the Medical

School. According to Zumwalt, when she filed a sex
ual harassment claim against a professor, Stanford
resolved her complaint by agreeing that it would pro
tect her if that professor tried to damage her career,
which he never did.
Zylbert filed her complaint and "her claim of ha
rassment . . . was appropriately handled by Stanford
and was settled," t lit' Stanford press release stated.
Zylbert finished her degree at Stanford. She went
on to residency programs at UC-San Francisco and
the University of Minnesota, but she failed to com
plete her first year at either program.
With help from Stanford, she began work at Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center, although Zumwalt said
Zylbert had some interpersonal problems while she
was there.
Zumwalt said that a suggestion was made by Elliot
Wolfe, an assistant dean at the Medical School, that
she do some of her rotations for residency at Stanford
Hospital, but the Stanford officials in charge of the
residency program did not give approval.
After finishing her program at Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center, Zylbert filed her lawsuit against
Stanford, saying that Stanford breached its agree
ment with her, that Stanford had retaliated against

her and that she had been retaliat
ed against at Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center.
Before beginning her work in
Santa Clara, Zylbert never com
plained to Stanford and never
made claims that slit* was being re
taliated against.
"The important tiling is that
the court has found that there is
no merit to her claims," Zumwalt
said. "Stanford acted appropriate
ly in how it treated her. It hasn't
retaliated against her and the
court agreed."
While the case is closed with re

spect to Stanford, Santa (llara Val
ley Medical Center, which Zylbert
also sued, must still go to trial on
Feb. 19, even though the two cases
were previously consolidated.
.Stanford filed two motions, one
directed at Zylbert 's claims that
Stanford had breached its agree
ment to protect her and help her
complete her training, the second
directed at her claims that the
University retaliated against her.
Stanford's motion moved for
summary judgment, arguing that,
under the undisputed facts, Zyl
bert's claims were without merit as
a matter of law.
While the court granted both ol
Stanford's motions, it declined to
grant summary judgment to
Santa Clara Valley Medical Cen

ter s motion.
"It doesn't mean that [Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center] has
done anything wrong, it just
means that case didn't get thrown
out," Zumwalt said.
Zylbert's attorney, Dan Siegel,
told the San Jose Mercury News
that she will probably appeal the
decision.
"I don't see how a judge can
look through a sack of documents
and decide who's telling the
truth," Siegel said, adding that a
jury must see and hear witnesses
to make a fair ruling on the case.
Zumwalt said she doesn't think
the appeal will be honored.
"I don't think that there are
any good grounds for appeal."
she said.
