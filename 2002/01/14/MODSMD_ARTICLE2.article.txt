# Retaliation lawsuit dismissed
## 
### NICHOLAS CHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Friday, a Santa ('lara County Supreme Court
Judge terminated tlie last part of a lawsuit against
Stanford when he dismissed a retaliation claim filed
by former Stanford medical student Barbara Albert.
The lawsuit stemmed from, but was not a part of,
a sexual harassment claim made by Zylbert against a
Stanford professor more than 10 years ago.
The first part of Zylbert's claims against Stan
lord alleged that the University breached obliga
tions to protect her career after she graduated. Last
month, the court dismissed these claims as being
without merit.
"Her final claim against Stanford was that she had
been retaliated against by Stanford," University Gen
eral Counsel I)ebra Xumwalt said. "The court last
week threw that claim out as saying there was no ev
idence to support that."
According to a Stanford press release, "This [deci
sion] completely disposes of Dr. Zylbert's claims
against Stanford and confirms what has been Stan
ford's position from the beginning of this litiga
tion â€” that Stanford acted appropriately in its treat
ment of Dr. Zylbert and did nothing wrong."
In 1991, Zylbert was a student at the Medical

School. According to Zumwalt, when she filed a sex
ual harassment claim against a professor, Stanford
resolved her complaint by agreeing that it would pro
tect her if that professor tried to damage her career,
which he never did.
Zylbert filed her complaint and "her claim of ha
rassment . . . was appropriately handled by Stanford
and was settled," t lit' Stanford press release stated.
Zylbert finished her degree at Stanford. She went
on to residency programs at UC-San Francisco and
the University of Minnesota, but she failed to com
plete her first year at either program.
With help from Stanford, she began work at Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center, although Zumwalt said
Zylbert had some interpersonal problems while she
was there.
Zumwalt said that a suggestion was made by Elliot
Wolfe, an assistant dean at the Medical School, that
she do some of her rotations for residency at Stanford
Hospital, but the Stanford officials in charge of the
residency program did not give approval.
After finishing her program at Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center, Zylbert filed her lawsuit against
Stanford, saying that Stanford breached its agree
ment with her, that Stanford had retaliated against
