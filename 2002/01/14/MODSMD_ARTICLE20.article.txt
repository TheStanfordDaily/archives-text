# Team-player St. Clair provides spark off bench
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kveryone's been talking about the
depth of the No. 4 women's basketball
team all season.
Cuess what? We're going to do it again.
I low do you stop a team where its sixth
[wo]man can come off the bench, score 17
points, including three 3s, collect six re
bounds, make two blocks against one of the
opponent s leading scorers and play 30
minutes? Oregon is still trying to figure
that one out.
Senior guard Lauren St. Clair has not
started in a single game this season, and yet
her contributions to the team are among
its most consistent.
St. (Hair is a spark oil the bench for the
Cardinal and yesterday's 91-70 victory
over the Ducks was no exception.
After finding itself in the odd position of
being down 15-4 in the first four minutes,
St. (-lair was substituted into the game. She
immediately went to work, earning two
hard-fought points off an inside foul that
fueled the Cardinal comeback.
She remained in the game for the rest of
the first half and had put in 10 points as
Stanford regained its lead and went up by
six to end the half.
Her efforts, not only on offense, but also
on defense, had her returning to the court
to start the second half.
The sharp Oregon back-court of Lil
niesha Curry, Shaquala Williams and
|amie Craighead shot 7-1 1 from behind
the three-point line in the first half giving
the Cardinal some major trouble.
"We do miss Susan [King] and Jamie
[Carey] in situations like this," said
head coach I'ara VanDerveer, referring
to her two injured guards. "But credit
tht; team because nobpdy came in cry

ing at half time. I hey were ready to
guard them."
St. Clair was one of those brave and
eager defenders and the second half num
bers speak for themselves. The Oregon
backcourt fell to shooting only 10.7-per
cent behind the three in the second half
while the team only made 20.2-percent
from the field.
St. Clair's two blocks came against the
Ducks' leading scorers Williams and
Curry, further demonstrating her
tenacity.
"Lauren worked really hard on de
fense," VanDerveer said.
St. Clair always seems to have big
games against Oregon. Last year against
the Ducks, she scored 14 points, includ
ing four 3s, with two in the last three min
utes on an <S-() run to fend off an ()regon
comeback.
"Since I've been here we haven't lost to
()regon at home, and it was my last chance
to make sure of that," St. ('lair said.
While not a starter, St. Clair is comfort
able in her position.
"Ibis team is very special,'' St. Clair
said. "Maturity and selflessness are big
things. We win as Stanford and not as in
dividuals. I'm willing to do any role my
team needs."
It's that kind of attitude that has led
Stanford this far. With aspirations to fin
ish undefeated in conference play and
reach the Final Four, the Cardinal knows
it can count on huge efforts by anybody
front the bench.
Last night it was St. Clair, but others
have stepped up in the past and others will
step up in the future.
How do you stop a team with so many
weapons? Stanford hopes to go the rest of
the season without anyone determining
the answer. ,
