# Late comeback attempt fails, Oregon upsets No. 14 Card
## Strong performances by Jacobsen and Borchardt aren't enough

EUGENE, Ore. â€” Playing
against Oregon at Mac Arthur
Court is tough enough.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: Oregon 87, No.
14 Stanford 79

On Saturday, however, Stan
ford made it even tougher.
It played with only two men.
Casey Jacobsen finished with
,S2 points and Curtis Borchardt
had 29, but no one else scored
more than live for the Cardinal,
which suffered its second confer
ence loss, an 87-79 defeat to ()re
gon in front of a sold-out crowd
of 9,087.
So while Jacobsen and Bor
chardt had career-highs, the rest
had career-blahs.
And while J acobsen and Bor
chardt showed their range, the
rest showed their flaws.
"I'm starting five [players] this
year," coach Mike- Montgomery
said. "I'd like to have a couple
more guys that I can count on. 1
need a group of eight guys doing
what we need to Ik- doing."
I hat's six more than what the
Cardinal (9-4, 2-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) had on Saturday.
Yet, it was even conceivable
that just one more go-to guy
might have helped Stanford
avoid the loss.
Instead, freshman Josh Chil
dress and junior Julius Barnes
went 1 for 5, sophomore l eyo
Johnson went 1 for 4and freshman
('.hi is Hernandez went 0 for 4.
"We can't just be standing
around watching Casey," Mont
gomery said. "If he didn't get 22
points in the first half, we'd be
sucking grapes."

No grapes. But a whole bunch
of lemons.
Still, Stanford was able to cut a
10-point deficit in the second half
to 74-7!5 when Borchardt scored
his second of two 3-pointers.
Then, the Cardinal trailed by
four with a minute left.
However, two costly turnovers
sealed the loss. Twice, Hernandez
attempted to get the ball to Jacob
sen, and both times the passes
missed their mark.
"They knew exactly what we
were going to do," Jacobsen said.
"It's hard to do something when
8.000 people know what's going
to happen.
"It's a learning experience [for
Chris]. He's out there at the end
of the game because he's a leader.
I lopefully, we'll make that play in
the future."
Oregon (1 1-4, 5-1), which has
already defeated Arizona twice,
broke a 10-game losing streak to
the (Cardinal, dating back to 1996.
"This is the biggest win our
program has had in a while," said
Ducks point guard Luke Rid
nour. "People will start to see that
we're a good basketball team."
Sophomore forward Luke
Jackson, who was on the Pac-10
All-Freshman Team last year, led
the Ducks by scoring a hard
earned 27 points. He continually
slashed into the lane and created
open jump-shots.
"He was spectacular," Mont
gomery said of Jackson. "He took
the wind out of our sails."
At 7-foot-2 and 300 pounds,
Oregon center Chris Christof
lei sen had his way inside the key
and added 16 points. Frederick
Jones had 12, Brian Helquist
had 10 and Ridnour finished
with I I points, including three
3-pointers.
"I don't think our offense lost it
for us." Jacobsen said. "Oregon
couldn't have beaten us if they
didn't score on us every time
down the floor."
But the Ducks did. Or at least,
it seemed that way.

which the Golden Bears went on
a 6-0 run to end the half, the
Ducks went on an 8-2 run before
heading to the locker room.
"We just seem to let down. We
lose our focus and have mental
collapses at the wrong time,"
Montgomery said.
Furthermore, the overpower
ing presence of Christoffersen
forced Borchardt to rely on his
outside shooting after struggling
inside early on. Borchardt was 10
of 18 from the field, but six of
those baskets were from outside
the key.
"I wasn't able to explode
through [Christoffersen's] con
tact and I have to be able to do
that. I take full responsibility for
that," said Borchardt.
The crowd was also a factor.
Oregon's equivalent of the Sixth
Man Club, the "Pit Crew"
mocked the players from the
time they got off the bus. Their
favorite chant was directed to
ward Jacobsen.
"Cal and Oregon fans always
get after me. They're a great
crowd. I'd love to have them on
.my side," Jacobsen said.
The last time Stanford lost
twice this early in conference play
was in the 1995-96 season, when
it fell to UCLA and USC on its first
Pac-10 road trip.
. The Cardinal gets a bit of a
break by hosting conference bot
tom-dwellers Washington and
Washington State at Maples Pavil
ion this weekend.
Whether all five players on the
court will contribute is left to be
determined.
