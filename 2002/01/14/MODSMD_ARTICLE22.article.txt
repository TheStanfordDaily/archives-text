Mentally prepared but physically weary, the No.
I Stanford men's swim team was still able to hand
No. 12 Michigan its first defeat of the season, 11*4-
109, snapping the Wolverines' home winning
streak dating back to Jan. 18. 2001. Stanford im
proves to 4-0 overall.
I he Michigan match-up, a perennial piece of
the early racing season, signals the first big meet of
the season for the top-ranked Cardinal.
"We went into this meet pretty broken down; we
knew that we had better depth than their team.
[Michigan] put up a great battle but we just had many
fast people in each event," junior Randall Bal said.
Senior co-captain Michael O'Neil agreed.
"It was neat that both teams swam really well,"
he said. "We got to really be challenged, not only
individually, but the whole team as well"
The Cardinal dominated the competition
starting on Friday in a nine-event, non-scoring
meet by winning all eight swimming events.
Along the way, the Cardinal picked up two auto
matic and 11 consideration NCAA qualifying
times. Those who achieve the automatic time
standard are guaranteed a spot in tin- NCAA
championship meet come March. Similarly, those
with consideration times will be considered fora
berth at the championships.
I he 100-yard backstroke during the Friday ex
hibition meet highlighted a weekend of fast times
from the Cardinal. Sophomore Peter Marshall
(46.92) and Bal (47.50) both swam under the auto
matic qualifying standard, en route to leading a
four-man sweep of the 100-yard backstroke.
Sophomore Markus Rogan
controlled the 400 individual
medley, finishing in 3:48.81. Mar
shall and Rogan both set new pool
records in their respective events.
The success of the exhibition
meet provided momentum going
into the scored meet on Satur
day. I'he Cardinal won the open
ing event, the 400 medley relay,
despite having its top relay team
disqualified.
Rogan continued to impress as
he took the 200 IM (1:48.15) and
the 200 back (1:44.99) in official
competition. Bal, a backstroker
and sprinter, took top honors in
both the 50 free (20.17) and 100
free (44.60).
Sophomore Michael Bruce
and freshman Jayme Cramer
picked up double wins in their re
spective specialty strokes. Bruce
touched first, well ahead of the
competition, in the 100 breast
stroke (55.49) in the exhibition
meet, and then followed up on
Saturday by winning the 200

breast (1:59.01).
Cramer stole the spotlight in
the butterfly events. His time of
48.18 led a 1-5 Cardinal finish in
the 100 fly on Friday. In the 200
fly a day later, Cramer inched out
Wolverine Dan Ketchum, 1:46.59
to 1:46.62, for top honors.
The Wolverines, historically
noted for their strong distance
swimming program, proved once
again that quantity can also mean
quality by winning the distance
and middle freestyle events.
Freshman Wolverine Brendan
Neligan won the 1,000 and 500
free, while junior Garrett Mang
ieri took the 200 free.
The Cardinal will not face its
biggest competition, No. 2 and
defending national champion
Texas, until the NCAA c hampi
onship meet, so during the sea
son, either team can only com
pare times to gauge relative
speed. In this respect, this week
end's strong results bode well for
the Cardinal.
