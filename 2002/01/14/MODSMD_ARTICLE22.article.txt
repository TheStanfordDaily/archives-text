Mentally prepared but physically weary, the No.
I Stanford men's swim team was still able to hand
No. 12 Michigan its first defeat of the season, 11*4-
109, snapping the Wolverines' home winning
streak dating back to Jan. 18. 2001. Stanford im
proves to 4-0 overall.
I he Michigan match-up, a perennial piece of
the early racing season, signals the first big meet of
the season for the top-ranked Cardinal.
"We went into this meet pretty broken down; we
knew that we had better depth than their team.
[Michigan] put up a great battle but we just had many
fast people in each event," junior Randall Bal said.
Senior co-captain Michael O'Neil agreed.
"It was neat that both teams swam really well,"
he said. "We got to really be challenged, not only
individually, but the whole team as well"
The Cardinal dominated the competition
starting on Friday in a nine-event, non-scoring
meet by winning all eight swimming events.
Along the way, the Cardinal picked up two auto
matic and 11 consideration NCAA qualifying
times. Those who achieve the automatic time
standard are guaranteed a spot in tin- NCAA
championship meet come March. Similarly, those
with consideration times will be considered fora
berth at the championships.
I he 100-yard backstroke during the Friday ex
hibition meet highlighted a weekend of fast times
from the Cardinal. Sophomore Peter Marshall
(46.92) and Bal (47.50) both swam under the auto
matic qualifying standard, en route to leading a
four-man sweep of the 100-yard backstroke.
