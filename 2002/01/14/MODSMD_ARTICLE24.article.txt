PAC-10 MEN
IX )S ANGELES (AP) — After two months of up
and-down results, No. 11 UCLA showed uis one of
the best basketball teams in the country when it
knocked off No. 1 Kansas.

Cal 61, Oregon State 53
Arizona State 81, Washington State 71
No. 20 Arizona 74, Washington 69

Still, the question persists: Why can't they play
like this all the time?
"We always take for granted the Ball States and
the Pepperdines," forward Jason Kapono said.
"Anytime we play the Georgetowns and Kansas, we
come in and play with heart and passion."
The Bruins' lethargy cost them in losses to Ball
State, Pepperdine and Southern California, which
outhustled and outrebounded UCLA 81-77 on
Thursday.
UCLA was just the opposite in beating the top
ranked Jayhawks 87-77 on Saturday. The Bruins
were poised, even when Kansas got within four
points in the final minute after being down 15 three
times in the second half.
"What hurts so much is that we came back and
brought it within a couple possessions, but made
too many big mistakes," said Drew Gooden, who
led Kansas with 22 points.
UCLA held the nation's leading offense to a sea
son-low 77 points, 15.6 points below average;
forced the Jayhawks into 21 turnovers; and never
trailed after the 10-minute mark of the first half.
"Everybody was looking comfortable out there,"
forward T.J. Cummings said.
Especially Matt Barnes, who had 27 points two
days after scoring a career-high 34 and tying a
school record with seven 3-pointers against USC.
"I think we want it more when we're playing the
No. 1 team in the country," Barnes said. "We can be
No. 1 if we want it every night.
"It shows our potential, but last Thursday
showed what can happen when we don't come out
to play every game. It's kind of frustrating to know
that you can beat the No. 1 team, but then you can't
beat a team in your own conference that you should
beat. We're going to have to pick it up."
Coach Steve Lavin played down the significance
of beating a top-ranked team.
"It doesn't mean that much. Our kids have been
there before and they have the poise and confi
dence to play these games," he said.
The Bruins upset the top-ranked team for the
third consecutive season. They twice beat Stan
ford and now Kansas, with all three wins coming
after losses.
"What's most important is our kids' resiliency,"
Lavin said. "There was a relaxed confidence our
team had before and during the game."
The J ayhawks (13-2) had their 13-game winning
streak snapped the same week they took over the
No. 1 ranking from Duke.
"Falling out of No. 1 might be better for us. That
way there will be less pressure and we can focus
more on the game," guard Jeff Boschee said. "I
can't wait to practice so we can forget about this loss.
That's the best way to get over it — practice."
Kansas' six-game road winning streak ended,
and it lost for the first time in eight games in Cali

fornia under coach Ro\ Williams.
"It's i lie worst we played all year long and L'Cl A
had a great deal to do with that," Williams said. "At
halftime, just being down 11,1 felt lucky."

knocked off No. 1 Kansas.

Still, the question persists: Why can't they play
like this all the time?
"We always take for granted the Ball States and
the Pepperdines," forward Jason Kapono said.
"Anytime we play the Georgetowns and Kansas, we
come in and play with heart and passion."
The Bruins' lethargy cost them in losses to Ball
State, Pepperdine and Southern California, which
outhustled and outrebounded UCLA 81-77 on
Thursday.
UCLA was just the opposite in beating the top
ranked Jayhawks 87-77 on Saturday. The Bruins
were poised, even when Kansas got within four
points in the final minute after being down 15 three
times in the second half.
"What hurts so much is that we came back and
brought it within a couple possessions, but made
too many big mistakes," said Drew Gooden, who
led Kansas with 22 points.
UCLA held the nation's leading offense to a sea
son-low 77 points, 15.6 points below average;
forced the Jayhawks into 21 turnovers; and never
trailed after the 10-minute mark of the first half.
"Everybody was looking comfortable out there,"
forward T.J. Cummings said.
Especially Matt Barnes, who had 27 points two
days after scoring a career-high 34 and tying a
school record with seven 3-pointers against USC.
"I think we want it more when we're playing the
No. 1 team in the country," Barnes said. "We can be
No. 1 if we want it every night.
"It shows our potential, but last Thursday
showed what can happen when we don't come out
to play every game. It's kind of frustrating to know
that you can beat the No. 1 team, but then you can't
beat a team in your own conference that you should
beat. We're going to have to pick it up."
Coach Steve Lavin played down the significance
of beating a top-ranked team.
"It doesn't mean that much. Our kids have been
there before and they have the poise and confi
dence to play these games," he said.
The Bruins upset the top-ranked team for the
third consecutive season. They twice beat Stan
ford and now Kansas, with all three wins coming
after losses.
"What's most important is our kids' resiliency,"
Lavin said. "There was a relaxed confidence our
team had before and during the game."
The J ayhawks (13-2) had their 13-game winning
streak snapped the same week they took over the
No. 1 ranking from Duke.
