It was supposed to be the time of her life.
Fly to Paris to meet a friend, then spend
autumn quarter studying in Barcelona
among castles and seaside markets.
But when junior Kali Stanger turned
to hug her father goodbye at San Fran
cisco International Airport last Septem
ber, all the television monitors flashed
to "CANCEL."
"We figured it must be a computer
glitch," she said. "Then a United Airlines
person gathered everyone around and
said, 'We can't release details.' Someone
next to us had a cell phone and said planes
had crashed into both World Frade Towers
and the Pentagon."
It was Sept. 11. Terrorists had hijacked
four planes. Airports shut down nationwide.
Stanger kept her suitcases by the door,
but "the stress was really getting to me," she
said. "Classes were supposed to start Sept.
25, and it was the only quarter 1 could go
abroad because of pre-med classes."
She postponed her (light until Sept. 25
but felt uneasy on the eve of her flight. "I
started thinking I didn't want to be apart
from my family during it all," she said. "I
wanted to be in America. T his is something
that's going to define the rest of our lives
and I didn't want to be on the other side of
the world while it was happening."
She canceled her flight a few hours be

fore it took off.
Although Stanger's study in Barcelona
was through another university, she joined
four other students who canceled Stanford
overseas plans that autumn, citing reasons
relating to the Sept. 11 attacks. A small
handful of students also withdrew in the
winter for such reasons, according to
Jacqueline Wender, executive director of
overseas studies.
"[After the attacks], we announced we
would remain open and intended to start
programs on time, as scheduled," Wender
said. Despite four withdrawals each quar
ter, approximately 250 students stayed,
she said.
