## 
### IRENE NOGUCHI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was supposed to be the time of her life.
Fly to Paris to meet a friend, then spend
autumn quarter studying in Barcelona
among castles and seaside markets.
But when junior Kali Stanger turned
to hug her father goodbye at San Fran
cisco International Airport last Septem
ber, all the television monitors flashed
to "CANCEL."
"We figured it must be a computer
glitch," she said. "Then a United Airlines
person gathered everyone around and
said, 'We can't release details.' Someone
next to us had a cell phone and said planes
had crashed into both World Frade Towers
and the Pentagon."
It was Sept. 11. Terrorists had hijacked
four planes. Airports shut down nationwide.
Stanger kept her suitcases by the door,
but "the stress was really getting to me," she
said. "Classes were supposed to start Sept.
25, and it was the only quarter 1 could go
abroad because of pre-med classes."
She postponed her (light until Sept. 25
but felt uneasy on the eve of her flight. "I
started thinking I didn't want to be apart
from my family during it all," she said. "I
wanted to be in America. T his is something
that's going to define the rest of our lives
and I didn't want to be on the other side of
the world while it was happening."
She canceled her flight a few hours be

fore it took off.
Although Stanger's study in Barcelona
was through another university, she joined
four other students who canceled Stanford
overseas plans that autumn, citing reasons
relating to the Sept. 11 attacks. A small
handful of students also withdrew in the
winter for such reasons, according to
Jacqueline Wender, executive director of
overseas studies.
"[After the attacks], we announced we
would remain open and intended to start
programs on time, as scheduled," Wender
said. Despite four withdrawals each quar
ter, approximately 250 students stayed,
she said.

Over break, the Stanford Chess A and B teams competed in a chess tournament with teams from
North and South America. "Hie A team won third place, losing only to the University of Texas-Dallas.
Those who were overseas on
Sept. 1 1 witnessed the massive glob
al response to the events in America.
Junior Kllv Benson was studying
in Brazil when news readied her.
"Since noneofus really spoke or
understood Portuguese at that
point, we couldn't do much but
watch the footage over and over
again." Benson said. "One girl was
crying, but everyone else was just
staring at the television in shock."
Brazilians would ask her about
the attacks by "holding one arm
straight up to resemble a building
and using the other hand to crash
it," she recalled.

"Most Brazilians were sympa
thetic and denounced the attacks,"
Benson said. "But one college stu
dent told me that for him, those
planes crashing into the symbols of
capitalism were the best image in
the world for him."
Overall, the Sept. 1 1 attacks were
surreal, Benson said. Brazilians
continued with their daily lives.
"Their world remained nor
mal," Benson said.
When the U.S. declared war. ju
nior Lucv Ylandato rushed into her
host family's apartment in Santiago,
Chile. She found them watching a
soap opera.
"I said, 'I hear they declared
war,' and they said, 'Yeah, it's horri
ble,' and they went back to the soap
opera," Mandato said. "Other stuff
was going on in the world."

The Stanford in Santiago stu
dents were scheduled to visit Iguacu
Falls, a stretch 0f275 waterfalls bor
dering Brazil and Argentina.
I hen, news flash: al-Qaida quar
ters were reported to be there.
I he trip was cancelled.
They were warned not to go
near the American Embass\ or
Machu Picchu, nor travel outside
the country. But they still went.
"1 might never get to do this
again," Mandato said.
Students who were abroad fall
quarter "had an even more posi
tive attitude than Stanford stu
dents usually do," said Geoffrey
Track, director of the Stanford in
()xford program.
Studying overseas is even more
important now "to appreciate the
complex and dangerous world we

live in," I yack said.
On the other side of the hemi
sphere in Sydney, Australia, junior
Becca Nycum found sympathy the
day alter the attacks.
"In the gym, a guy came up to
me because of my Stanford T-shirt
and said, 'I can't speak lor the
whole country, but I 'm thinking so
much for you and your friends,' "
Nycum recalled.
Some of her friends had can
celled their overseas plans. Nycum
admitted it sometimes frustrated
her to be abroad.
" That was a time when you're
supposed to be independent, and
all you wanted was to be back
home," she said.
Back in America, airports had
multiple security checkpoints. In
Washington, most legislative

buildings were closed due to an
thrax scares.
Stanford in Washington stu
dents were planning on meeting a
I louse representative.
But that was before he received a
letter possibly containing anthrax.
I he meeting was cancelled.
"There's more interest in bioter
rorism here," said senior Shirley
Delaleu, who is studying in Wash
ington. I).C. during the program's
quarter on health and environmen
tal policy.
After her quarter in Brazil, Ben
son returned home lor Christmas
before Hying off for winter quarter
in (ihile.
"It was strange to be an Ameri
can.' said Benson. "There was some
undertone I couldn't quite put my
linger on, some leeling of loss, but

nothing was radically different."'
There were more flags, she ad
mits. Bumper stickers and hats la
beled "NYFD" were everywhere.
For Stanger, it was the "little
things," she said, that make her
not regret missing that flight to
Barcelona.
She ended up getting a job as a
Stanford tour guide and will lead an
Alternative Spring Break trip to
Yosemite. These are what make
choices different from each other,
she said.
"There's something about being
here and seeing the faces, and see
ing the flags and watching that
memorial service and so many
things that are going to be a part of
our memory that 1 wouldn't have
had if I went to Spain," she said. "1
can always go to Spain."
