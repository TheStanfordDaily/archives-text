# January blood donations drop
## After a successful fall, the Stanford Blood Center enters its typical winter shortage 
### SARAH PAPÃ‰ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the torrent of blood donations
in the wake of the Sept. 1 1 terrorist at
tacks, it seemed like blood banks would
not run out any time in the near future;
but only four months after the attacks,
a national blood shortage is taking
hold, and Stanford Blood Center is
feeling its elfects.
January is typically a difficult month
for blood centers, and this year is no dif
ferent. Normally, the Stanford Blood
Center likes to have enough blood in its
inventory for two days; light now, the
center only has enough for one day.
"[ln general], hospitals tend to use
more blood in January, while it is more
difficult for us to collect the needed
units," said Michele Gassaway, the com
munity and media relations director for
the Stanford Blood Center.
Winter driving conditions create
more traffic problems and people need
ing surgery tend to postpone it until
after the holidays. With students start
ing school and people coming back
from vacation, the Blood Center has
trouble soliciting donations.
In an effort to ease the shortage, the
Blood Center, which normally closes its
Palo Alto facility on Fridays, has kept it
open for the past three weeks. January

is also National Volunteer Blood Donor
month, where blood centers stress the
importance of giving blood.
"We are asking people to make a
resolution to save someone's life," Gas
savvay said. "Stanford Hospital is a
world-class hospital, but no matter how
skilled a surgeon is, without blood, be
fore, during and after surgery, it is to
no avail."
The Blood Center supplies blood to
Stanford Hospital and Clinics, a leader

in transplant surgeries and trauma
treatment, and to I.utile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital, which uses high levels
of blood for pediatric surgeries.
According to Gassaway, the Blood
Center saw a strong student turnout
after Sept. 1 I, but not many first-time
donors have returned to give blood
again. Anyone who donated then could
have donated two additional times


''The Stanford Daily
Although many students donated blood earlier this year in response to Sept. 11, dona
tions have dropped this month.
