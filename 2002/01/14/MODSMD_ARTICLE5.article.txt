### JED ROSE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Chess A-team checked
in with a strong third-place showing at
the annual Pan American Intercollegiate
Chess Championship in Providence,
R. 1., over winter break.
The championship, which brought to
gether about 30 of the top schools from
Not th and South America, began on
Christmas Day. Stanford's A and B teams
played a variety of teams, including Har
vard, Catolica University from Peru, the
University ofC '.hit ago and two teams from
the University of Texas-Da lias.
The team defeated Harvard and
Chicago and drew its matches against the
University of Texas B team and Catolica.
The Stanford team suffered only one

loss of the tournament: to eventual co
champion University of Texas-Dallas.
University of Maryland-Baltimore
County was the other team to share
first-place honors at the prestigious
chess championship.
Both UTD and UMBC are known to
offer full scholarships to their chess
team recruits, making their first place
finish iti the tournament almost rou
tinely predictable. The two schools
have won the tournament for many
years in a row.
"The strength of our team has in
creased steadily each year," said senior
Etan I Held, captain of Stanford's A-team.
"It's now to the point where we can give
both UTD and UMBC a real run for
their money."
Members of the third-place A-team in
cluded I Held, Jacob Chudnovsky, a doc
toral student in cancer biology, Ryan
Porter, a doctoral student in computer
science, Jordy Mont-Reynaud, a sopho
more and Philip Wang, a junior.
Phis year was the first year that Stan

ford's A-team consisted entirely of chess
masters. The rank of master, which I lfeld
compared to the rank of black belt in
martial arts, is a lifetime honor, awarded
after a player earns a certain number of
points in chess matches.
This year also marked the first year
that Stanford's team was divided into an
A- and B-team.
"It was great to have the B-team
around," Ilfeld said.
I'he Stanford B-team made an im
pressive debut at the tournament, top
pling A-teams from other universities.
One of the highlights for both of Stan
ford's teams was their victories over Har
vard's A-team.
"| During] the tournament, our A
team smashed their A-team," said sopho
more B-team member Tom Martell.
"And then later that afternoon our B
team beat their A-team 3-1."
Freshman Yining Ni was the captain
of the B-team. Martell. senior Kimberly
Goodwin and sophomore Dan Ben-
Moshe also competed.
