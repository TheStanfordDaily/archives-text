Bay Area's buses still run
on diesel, despite push
elsewhere for cleaner
burning fuels
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Many of the state's re
gions have switched to public transportation powered
In alternative fuels, hut the San Francisco Bay area has
opted to keep the noisier, dirtier diesel-burning buses.
I he sfiie Air Resources Board had considered hav
ing large transit agencies stop buying diesel buses com
pletely and have them use cleaner compressed or lique
fied natural gas buses instead. Then it would have re
quired the transit agencies to use buses powered by hy
drogen 112 uel cells.
1 hirteen of the Bay Area's 15 transit agencies are
staying with diesel, but the Air Resources Board is con
sidering eliminating the diesel option. It will vote in
March on whether to require all agencies to buy only
natural gas and other alternative fuel buses.
About 88 percent of the Bay Area bus fleet is diesel.
Los Angeles' fleet is 50 percent diesel, and Sacramento's
is 35 percent.

Lack of diversity in higher
education could cause worker
shortage, report says
The United States faces a social and economic crisis if
diversity in higher education isn't drastically improved,
a coalition ofcorporate chief executives and university
presidents says in a report released on Thursday.
The report, titled "Investing in People: Developing
All of America's Talent on Campus and in the Work
place," notes that while the country's minority popula
tion continues to grow rapidly, members of most racial
and ethnic groups are far from being proportionally
represented on most college campuses.
According to the report, about 90 percent of both
white American and African-American adults had fin
ished high school as of 1998, but only two-thirds of 11is
panic Americans had done so. At the college level, 28
percent of white Americans held bachelor's degrees in
2000, while less than 17 percent of African-Americans
and only I 1 percent of Hispanics did.
The report's authors predict that there will be 19
million more jobs than workers who are adequately
prepared to lill them by 2028.
