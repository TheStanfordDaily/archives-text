Lecture Series

Thomas W. Simons, Jr., U. S. Ambassador to Pakistan, 1996-1998
"Central Asia in the Post-September World"
Ambassador Simons will draw on his research and experience in the region to review Central
Asia's first decade of independent statehood. Domestically, its new states have struggled to devel
op new national personalities and capabilities; vis-a-vis the outside world, the region has emerged
as a kind of megabuffer between its neighbors in turmoil: Russia and Afghanistan, but also China
and Iran. He will then follow the massive reentry of the outside world, including the 11 S., since
September 11, and the new challenges for both outsiders and Central Asians. In conclusion he
will suggest three possible options for the region's future.
