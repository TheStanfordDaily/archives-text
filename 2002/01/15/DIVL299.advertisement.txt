Stanford Professor Of Education,
LARRY Cuban, Will Discuss His Book,
Oversold & Underused:
Computers in the Classroom
These days the topic on everyone's lips-from
public officials and corporate executives to
policymakers and parents-is technology
in the classroom. In Oversold and Underused,
Larry Cuban, one of the most prominent and
well-respected skeptics of the real teaching
value of computerizing classrooms, describes
his studies of several different schools in
Silicon Valley. He found that new technologies
are rarely used in the classroom, even when
available, and points out that historical and
economic contexts influence how most
teachers teach and use (or don't use) technical
innovations. He argues that what we need is
attention to the deepest civic and human goals
of schooling-goals that can't be reached with
just more classroom computer time.
