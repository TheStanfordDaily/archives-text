# PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY
## Time, Life, Acceling 
### 
I wake up this morning and haveonh live
minutes to get where I'm going, so I
don't want to be where I am.
I throw off the covers ol my nicely
warmed lied and throw my notebooks into
m\ bag, which 1 toss over my shoulder, and
t hen jump onto my bike and rait' to class. I
sit down in class just after the professor
starts and settle down from mv momentan
frenzy. I slept only six hours last night.
So my head nods as the teacher drones
about some new set of observations and
connections humans made not long ago.
1 le's pretty excited about all the stuff'we're
learning so quickly in his field these days.
He makes a joke about an ignorant con
ception of the world that people used to
have, and I'm temporarily jolted out of my

daze. I don't get the joke,
because I haven't been
paying attention, and I
didn't have time to drink
inv coflee this morning,
so I'm too slow for him.
I'm not going to under
stand much today, so I
jnsi want to get through
this class. So, when I hear

the professor wrapping up, I start packing
up, and the professor is like, "one more
minute," but I've already decided that he's
finished, and when he does stop speaking
I'm the third person out of the room.
"Hi," I nod to someone I know from mv
freshman dorm. We haven't actually
stopped to talk all quarter.
So I'm on my bike again and I'm going
to my next ( lass, which is far away and was
scheduled so that I have only seven min
utes to get there, and I don't recognize any
one I know until it's too late to say, "hi." I
get upset with the slow walkers spread out
in front of me and at the guy who's reck
lessly weaving around people on his bike.
And I just don't understand whyothei peo
ple have to be such a problem.
So I get to my next class, and I snatch a
seat. It's another class (hat's only mildly in
teresting. This is one of those classes
where I really respect the professor, but I
don't have time to do all the reading. I
think I miss a lot.
I sometimes think about living on cam
pus without all the deadlines and pres
sures. I could just learn what I want to
learn, hangout with friends, go skiing and
visit all the other interesting places in this
area. But I really shouldn't be upset by my
life. This is the best time of my life, after all.
I think I like it here. I like it. Actually, I
know I like it. A lot.
I he professor finishes, and I jump
hark on my bike and go back to my dorm,
but I forget to stop by the Bookstore to
buy new batteries for my alarm clot k, and
st) I rush back to get them. But I can't
stand lines, even though I have to.
I know that I'm going to be late to
lunch with an old friend I haven't seen in
a while. Luckily I know she will be late

also. We grab food and talk to each other.
I'm so impressed In how busy she's been.
Hut she lias i<> rush oil to a meeting,
and I have to go to another class. So we
agree to meet again sometime.
After dass, I bike back to my room. I
haven't cheeked e-mail all day! But it's just
announcements for events I don't have time
to go to. I start catching up on my reading,
but I realize that I need to exercise. I lie
gym is crowded, and ni\ favorite mat bine is
broken, so I trv out a new and unfamiliar
mac hint*. If feels strange, but, hey. change is
good. I hen I notice that I haveonh 45 min
utes before dinner, so I try to work extra
hard, even on ni\ strange machine.
I make it back to dinner in time to get
some ol the good food! But I don't slav for
long, because I need to do some reading. But
it's hard to stick with, even though it's about
dinosaurs and a meteor and the scramble to
survive, fin not understanding it.
So I check e-mail again and get a really
long and thoughtful e-mail from a friend
on the Kast. ('.oast. But it's too good: I don't
have the time to respond properly right
now. I really like this h iend.
So my attention wanders, and 1 pick up
mv stuffed dinosaur. Here's one that
didn't go extinct, I think cleverly. But he
doesn't look like a survivor at all. He's
goofy-looking and solt, and he looks like
he'd be really slow . And, though I've only
had him fora little while, I've used him
enough that he's already old and 1 should
get a new one. But — ahlih — what am I
doing? I don't have time for this.
I do the reading for another class, but I
don't do as much as I need to. I start re
sponding to my friend's e-mail, but I don'l
want to send him a 20 page e-mail, so I
have to think about what I want to say. I'll
finish it later.
I continue my reading. I'm catching
up. I think this is progress!
I decide I'm going to go to bed a little
bit earlier than usual today. So I move
some piles around in my room, and get
into bed. Another day over. But I start
thinking about all the things I still have to
do, like thai application, and solidifying
my plans for spring break, and deciding
what I'm going to do this summer, and
getting my brother a birthday present,
and I'm still way behind on reading.
Damn! I didn't do anything today.
I'm sick and tired of doing so much, I
think. But it's not that bad. I like being
busy. I think I might be getting a little si< k.
Hopefully just a little, though, because I
don't have the time to be sick. I'm sick of
being sick.
