Gaudefs definitions are outdated
I am writing in response to Rob (.audi t's
column last week, "Ideological Resolu
tions." Ciaudet typically provides well-rea
soned, well-informed opinions that raise the
level of discourse. In last week's paean to the
virtues of resurrecting the progressive
movement, Gaudet does truth a disservice
by propagating the same myths that have
led to the continued irrelevance of the left
wing point of view.
lb fixate on antiquated definitions of
progressive versus conservative In calling
conservatives "reactionary" is naive and
simplistic, fliere are those of us who dis
agree with the progressive movement, yet
do not support social regression. We mere
ly resent the idea that the only path toward
progress is through greatei state control.
We resent the idea that progress can only
come at the hands of a government run b\
an over-educated, technocratic elite out of
touch with the common people. Instead,
government should be restrained and the
people empowered, so that theii potential
is unlocked.
I he progressive movement has been
tried and has led to many successes, but
more and more, their idealism and good in

tenuous have not brought about their in
tended results.
1 he only evidence Gaudet oilers lor the
efficacy of a progressive regime is I>\ way of
the Norwegian states. What he (ails to ap
preciate is that the Norwegian countries
are monolithic blond-haired blue-eyed
Aryans who share a hatred for immigra
tion and diversity equaled only by I'at
Buchanan. I am sure if we only consider
cqualh pure-blood American descendants
ol the Mayflower, we will find they are
equally well-off as the Norwegians.
Further, if you compare the United
States with the also socialistic but slightly less
immigrant-phobic France, you will find that
the Fiench have half (by percentage) the In
ternet users of the I nitecl States, as well as
lower cell phone penetration, not to men
tion significantly lower income (Economist
World Fact hook). I rue, the I nited Stales
has greater poverty, but that is because most
of the poor in this country are the newly ar
rived. For most of these huddled masses, if
you examine the evidence rather than your
intentions, you will see that their children
tend mostly to rise up in Americ an society,
rise* up to affluence in a society that is un
questionably the ric lies) in the world.
(icorge Washington may indeed have

praised liberals. However, in his day, the
term had quite a different meaning than the
perversion it has become today. A classical
liberal, as envisioned by John Locke, saw the
potential of every man to make his own des
tiny. This man was not dependent on some
Washington lawmaker to make it for him.
I 111 ot k the chains imposed by government,
