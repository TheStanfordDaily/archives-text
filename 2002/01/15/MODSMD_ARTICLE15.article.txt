MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Today: Stanford at Pacific, 7
p.m., Stockton, Cal.

I he Tigers, who received votes
in the Volleyball Maga/ine presea
son poll but were ultimately left out
<>l the rankings, won their season
opener against I JC-Santa (Cru/, 30-
28, HO-20, 30-19. However, Pacific
then suffei ed a disappointing four
game loss against the I niversity of
I.a Vei ne in its home opener.
II the Tigers are looking to re
deem themselves tomorrow after
theii loss last week, they will face an
uphill battle against a tough (Cardi
nal team.
I'he Cardinal began its season
by defeating UC-Santa Cruz in its
season opener, before splitting a
doubleheader against 1U IJ last
weekend, proving that Stanford
posed more than just a threat to the
potent (Cougars.
I he Cardinal not only gained
experience against a top-notch
team last weekend, but also a posi
tive state of mind.
"Whenever we spread and pass
the ball like we did, we're unstop
pable." redshirt junior Seth King
said after Stanford's 3-1 victory

over BYU Friday night.
fhe (Cardinal's increased confi
dence should make its deadly ol
fense even more threatening to
the Tigers.
Fhe Stanford oflense is procluc -
ing 15.8 kills per game, with a
major contribution coming from
junior Curt I oppel, a returning
All-American.
foppel leads the team in kills,
averaging 5.5 kills per game, and
has i halked-up more than 50 kills
in only three mate lies.
Redshirt freshman setter
Kevin Hansen is another large
factor in the (Cardinal oflense, av
eraging a whopping 12.15 assists
per game, totaling more than I 30
already this season.
Pacific will have to defend
against this tough (Cardinal oflense
with an especially young team.
More than half of the 1 igers are
underclassmen.
Furthermore, the Tigers are
missing star player Vladimir An
dric, who holds Pacific records in
career games played and service
aces, and ranks in the top three in
total assists, block assists, kills, total
bloc ks and digs.
Pacific will be led In Sean
Rodgers and Sl\ Yeoman, who
posted Hi kills and 51 assists, re
spectively, in the last match against
LaVei ne. Rodgers also holds Pacif
ic's record in career hitting per
centage with .401.
I he match against Pacific is only
the beginning, as Stanford contin
ues with a c hallenging schedule in
the weeks to come, inc hiding fac ing
No. 2 I lawaii and attending an in
vitational at top-ranked Penn State
t hat same week.
