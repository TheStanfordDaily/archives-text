ASIIIU RN. Ya. (Al') — Steve Spurriei made hi*
mark <>n the NFL even before < oa< liing his fit si game
01 l imning a pracliee.
I le became the highest-paid t <>a< li in league histo
i \ Mondav, hired bv the Washington Redskins a da\
aftei they fired Marly St hottenheimer. i he tiaiiona
< hampionship-yv inning < oa< h at Florida signed <i five
\ear deal worth $2~> million.
I he deal, (on firmed h\ a team sourt e speaking or
condition of anonymity, surpasses the previous \FI
high of SI million a year Mike Holmgren makes a>
Seattle's < oat hand general managet.
Spin i ier, yvho abruptly left Florida on |an. I aftet
«i 12-year run that also intituled six Southeastern
Conference titles, will he introduced I uesday at ;
news 11inference at Redskin Park.
Spurrier, a former backup quarterback in tlit
NFL, "will hung a supercharged, exciting and tly
nainit brand of footlrall to out great fans," team
ownei I )an Snyder s.iid.
W ashington defensive tackle Kenartl Lang got t<
know Spurrier while playing foi the I diversity ol
Miami against Florida.
"He's not arrogant, but he's real, real, real confi
dent,' Lang said. "But he h;is to realize he has men
he's toat lung instead of little bo\ s. who were just leav
ing their mommy and daddy and have their little old
pat ificrs in their mouth."
Lang is one of 17 unrestricted free agents on the
Redskins' roster, a wrinkle Spurrier never had to han
dle in t ollcge.
Sputtier's offenses always looked as il they be
longed in the pros, but quarterback is the Redskins
most uncertain position because neithei I ony Banks
nor Kent Graham is under contract for next season.
But Spun ier will have help from a yet-to-l>e-hired

general manager, not wanting to run the whole oper
ation the way Schottenheimer did as coach and direc
toi < >1 football operations.
Snyder's desire to regain some of that power led
him to fire St hottenheimer, the first coach in NFL his
tory to start the season ()-. r ) and win the next five
games. I he Redskins finished 8-8 in his only season
coat hing the team.
While Snyder thought St hottenheimer's job as
coat 11 was acceptable, the owner was unhappy with
personnel moves involving Larry Centers, Jeff
(.corgi- and others.
S< hottenheimer will receive the $7.5 million re
maining on the four-year, $10 million contract he
signed ;i year ago, with the Redskins picking up the
difference in deals if Schottenheimer signs with an
other team.
I he next step for Washington is to hire a general
ntanagei, with Brute Allen, Vinny Cerrato, Bobby
Beat hard and Ron Wolf among the top candidates.
Spurrier became the country's most-wanted coach
after he suddenly quit Florida and declared himself
ready to take on the NFL. A colorful sideline presence
and mastermind at offensive game-planning. Spurri
ei went 122-27-1 with the Gators and won the 1996
national title.
I le has coat hed one professional team, the Tampa
Bay Bandits of the LSI L, going 35-19 in three sea
sons before the league folded.
I he 190(i Heisman I rophy winner as a quarter
back for Florida, Spurrier played in the NFL from
19<)7-7C>. nine of those seasons as a bat kupQß for the
San Franc isco 49ers.
I Its one of them love-em, hate-em kind of guys,"
Lang said. "He wants to tic»things his way. If he wants
to put some points on somebody, he's goinir it) do it."
