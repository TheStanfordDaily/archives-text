### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter outscoring Minnesota on
the vault Saturday night in its.sea
sou opener, the defending Pac-10
champion women's gymnastics
team looked to he in complete con
trol, ready to show off its new
freshmen and new coach in Min
neapolis to a team that hadn't even
made nationals last year.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
Saturday: No. 15 Minnesota
195.800, No. 8 Stanford
194.675

But the pesky Golden Gophers
— a team that missed nationals b)
.15 of a point —earned some re
demption by conquering the Car
dinal — national qualifier last year
— in the other three events.
I ll is earned them the win by
the margin of 195.8-194.(>75 to
notch their second victory of
tlu- season.
The Cardinal's three returning
first team All-Americans were up
staged by Minnesota's second
team Ail-American, Maryanne
Kelley, who swept all but the vault
on her way to edging out Stanford
sophomore Caroline Fluhrer in
the all around.
I he Cardinal started strong,
with its three sophomores sweep
ing the top spots on the vault,
highlighted by Fluhrer's 9.850.
I he infusion of young blood in
the form of freshmen Mandy l)el
gado and Maria Ranieri also
helped the team, earning a 9.750
and 9.025, respectively.
While Stanford was on the
vault, Minnesota countered by
taking the top three places on the
uneven bars, leaving 112 luhrer and
senior co-captain Becky Meldrum
in a tie for fourth.
Down by just .075 after the first
half of the competition, the (Cardi
nal blew its opportunity to trim
down the deficit and justify its No.

(S preseason ranking, as it had two
falls on the beam and was soundly
beaten on the floor.
On the beam, three Cardinal
gymnasts tied for second place,
led by sophomores Kendall Beck,
l.ise Leveille and Lindsay Wing.
Particularly impressive was
Beck's performance, which
marked her first college competi
tion, as she sal out last year with a
knee injury.
Unfortunately, some early sea
son jitters seemed to be apparent
as senior Katy 1 lerbert and junior
Kelsey Stillinger both fell on the
event, though they recovered im
pressively.
With two first team all-Ameri
cans competing for the Cardinal
on the floor, the biggest disap
pointment of Saturday had to he
that event. Wing and Leveille both
had solid performances, but didn't
live up to their stellar marks of last
season.
Fluhrer picked up some of the
slack though, concluding a thor
oughly dominating day with a
team leading 9.85 to snag second
place in the all around with
39.225.
Coach kristen Smyth, in her
first competition as a head coach,
was "very happy" with the team's
score, despite the loss, as the team
opened in front of a hostile crowd.
"I really liked the way the team
covered each other. If we had a
fall, the next person stepped up to
close the gap. Both Kelsey and
Katy showed a lot of character,"
Smyth said.
Smyth reiterated that it all was a
matter of peakingat the right time.
"Most of our routines were
strong, [just] a little bit tentative
in some areas ... Floor, we were
a little late getting started ...
I here was a little bit of nervous
ness 112 for the first meet of the sea
son]," she said. "I'm excited for
our home opener."
I he Cardinal finds itself in a fa
miliar position going into Friday's
competition against Washington.
List year, it also entered its meet
against the Huskies with an 0-1
record. That team went on to win
the Pac -10s and qualify for nationals
for the first time in school history.
