### ELIZABETH MADJLESI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford ranks No. 1 in Federal
Community Service Work-Study pro
gram participation, according to an
analysis of government data by The
Washington Monthly.
With 22.3 percent of its students
choosing to do community service to earn
federal work-study funding, Stanford
places above all the other schools in its
bracket, the top 20 universities in the
country as ranked by U.S. News and
World Report.
Harvard and Yale took fifth and
sixth place, while Ml I took last place

among I lie 20 universities, with 1.9
percent pai li( ipation.
"Stanford is known as the brains be
hind Silicon Valley," said \adinne Cruz,
director of the Haas Center fin Public
Service. "What is not known is that ii is
also a souk e of leadership for communi
ty service and nonprofit work."
"It is rarely recognized, but the fact is
Stanford's public service focus is woven
into the very fabric of Stanford's history; it
goes all the way back to |ane Lathrop
Stanford and the founding of this institu
tion," Cruz added.
All students eligible for the work-study
program are given the option of spend
ing their time doing community service.
I his fac tor contributes to the relatively
high percentage of participation at Stan
ford, because other universities cap the
percentage of students who may fulfill
their work-study requirements through
community service programs.

"Many Stanford students participate in
CSWS in theii own home towns or other
places in the U.S. over the summer, so
East Palo \lto is not the only place where
students carry out the (ISWS," (Iru/ said.
" I he Financial Aid office has been sup
portive of students seeking to apply their
work-stud\ funds working in other com
munities," she added.
Mary Morrison, director of funds man
agement for the Financial Aid ()ffice, is re
sponsible for the use of Stanford's I itle I\'
funds received annually from the I .S. 1 )e
-partment of Education, which partly
funds the Federal Work Study program.
"In conjunclion with the Provost's (Jl
lic e, we established the ( SWS program by
working cooperatively with the llaas
Center, which already had relationships
with many local community groups,"
Morrison said.

Students sign up for the Ravenwood Read program at the Haas Center. The Washington Monthly
lists Stanford as best among elite schools in Federal Community Service Work-Study participation.
Congress recently passed a bill
increasing the CSW'S percentages
from live to seven percent, hut "It
didn't matter to us since we far ex
ceeded that percentage from the
beginning," Morrison said.
"The University supplies 15
percent of the students' wages be
sides their support lor the admin
istrative costs, Morrison said. "We

could ask the agencies lor 25 per
cent of the students' wages but we
only ask them lor 1 0 percent, since
the I Diversity is supplying l"> per
cent and this makes ii possible lor
more community agencies to hire
our students."
"I am not really that surprised
by the news that Stanford lares so
well compared to other schools in
CSWS," said sophomore Susan
I'ieh, a tutor in the Ravenswood
Reads program. "The Haas Cen
ter provides the resources lor siu
dcnts to participate in programs,

and when people decide to do
something here, they are really
committed to doing a good job."
(a u/ said that, despite the No. 1
tanking, there is always room lor
improvement in community ser
vice work-study at Stanford.
"We are painfully aware of what
else could be done to make this
better," she said. "But clearly,
none ol this would be possible
without the implicit support of the
Provost's oflice and the Financial
Aid ollicc's ver\ generous, proac
tive support."
