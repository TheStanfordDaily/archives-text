### ELLIE RITCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shakespeare's plays have long been sur
rounded by a mysterious air of conspiracy. How
could one man, with hardly any literary or the
atrical instruction, have been the mastermind be
hind an entire canon of British literature? In her
latest plav, Stanford Drama Prof. Amy freed
presents her own take on the authorship debate.
"I lie Beard of Avon" is the hottest play on the
regional market, and, after its first production at
the Orange County Register, was quickly slated
to visit stages in major cities across the country.
I he play offi< ially opens its doors this week at
the ('reary Theatre in San Francisco but was avail
able lor preview audiences last weekend.
Instead of supporting the traditional under
cover author theories. Freed's script explains
how Shakespeare could have become a literary
genius. Her offbeat comedy records the 16th
century journey of a yokel from Stratford-on-
Avon to elitist London theatres.
The title "The Beard of Avon" often generates
confusion when heard for the first time, as many
do not ft illy appreciate Freed's play on words. In
10th century England, "beard' was commonly
understood to mean a front or mask.
In "Beard," Freed suggests that Edward de
Vere was the author behind the works attributed
to the rural ben named Shakespeare.
" I his play is very much a fantasia, because a
play on this subject couldn't be a ->ei ions biogra
phy," I reecl said.
Freed's romp with (he author
ship issue concentrates on the
learning processes behind one of
the greatest playwrights of all time.
"I mostly wanted to debunk the
idea that Shakespeare was an idiot
savant who didn't have to strug
gle," she said.
Drama Department Adminis
trative Services Manager Ron
Davies attended the preview this
weekend.
"The script plays with anachro
nism,'' he said. "Modern ideas are
brought into the Elizabethan play
for humorous effect. There are
some off-color jokes, but only to
stay within the spirit of Shake
speare himself."
Even before viewing his col

league's production, Davies mused
that it could have been possible l<>r
the gifted country bumpkin to
write 3(> plays and I."Â»I sonnets.
"There is a snobbism that says
an uneducated person could not
have written these plavs," he said.
Freed could not agree more.
"The play is an argument
about education versus talent and
privilege versus humanity; and
which of these ii is that makes
someone a professional writer."
Freed said.
In the opening ads, the odds
seem stacked against Shakespeare
as an author, but by the end,
Freed makes a strong and plausi
ble case for him as a literary hero.
lu 1984, Freed entered the
American Conservatory I heal re
actor training program in New
York, which ex
posed her to imaginative writing
for the first time. Six years ago,

1 i eed moved to I he Bay Ai ea and
joined the Stanford community.

"Acting: Ihe Fundamentals" and
will teat h "Actors Who
