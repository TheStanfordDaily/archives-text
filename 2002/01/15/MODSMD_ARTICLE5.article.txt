### ELLIE RITCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shakespeare's plays have long been sur
rounded by a mysterious air of conspiracy. How
could one man, with hardly any literary or the
atrical instruction, have been the mastermind be
hind an entire canon of British literature? In her
latest plav, Stanford Drama Prof. Amy freed
presents her own take on the authorship debate.
"I lie Beard of Avon" is the hottest play on the
regional market, and, after its first production at
the Orange County Register, was quickly slated
to visit stages in major cities across the country.
I he play offi< ially opens its doors this week at
the ('reary Theatre in San Francisco but was avail
able lor preview audiences last weekend.
Instead of supporting the traditional under
cover author theories. Freed's script explains
how Shakespeare could have become a literary
genius. Her offbeat comedy records the 16th
century journey of a yokel from Stratford-on-
Avon to elitist London theatres.
The title "The Beard of Avon" often generates
confusion when heard for the first time, as many
do not ft illy appreciate Freed's play on words. In
10th century England, "beard' was commonly
understood to mean a front or mask.
In "Beard," Freed suggests that Edward de
Vere was the author behind the works attributed
to the rural ben named Shakespeare.
" I his play is very much a fantasia, because a
play on this subject couldn't be a ->ei ions biogra
phy," I reecl said.
