other dining hall with sut ha meal plan.
After a week of the new a la carte sys
tem, student reactions are mixed. While
some students see the shilt as a money
saver and waste reducer, others claim
that the price system is unt leai and thai
they are eating less food than they would
otherwise.

"In some ways it's better, because il
you're a light eater then you save
money," said (ledro freshman Sarala Na

have not changed since the new meal
plan was instituted.

you-can-eat meal plan to the a la carte plan.
