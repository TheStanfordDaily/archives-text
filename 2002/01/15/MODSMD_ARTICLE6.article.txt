In a change that has produced widely
varied reac lions frotn students, the newly
remodeled Wilbur Dining Mali now op

of the traditional all-you-can-eal s\stem
used by most resident e dining halls.
As a result of this shift, which went
into effect on Jan. 7, all Wilbur residents
were forced to change their meal plans
mid-year.
fhis switch tomes after the fat ility re
opened in late November following a
major renovation.
Students dining at Wilbur now pa\ for
each of the individual items they select
using a points system with a (let lining bal
ance. Currently, Manzanita is the onl\
other dining hall with sut ha meal plan.
After a week of the new a la carte sys
tem, student reactions are mixed. While
some students see the shilt as a money
saver and waste reducer, others claim
that the price system is unt leai and thai
they are eating less food than they would
otherwise.

"In some ways it's better, because il
you're a light eater then you save
money," said (ledro freshman Sarala Na
gala, who added that her eating habits
have not changed since the new meal
plan was instituted.
Okada junior (.wen l.im agreed that,
lor her, the a la carte plan is proving more
efficient.
"()n the meal system I ended up wast

students who eat lightly at certain meals
are able to then spend int>re at others.
"Students who cat .1 bagel and juice,
or cereal and milk Ibi breakfast are de

Students have three choices under the
a la carte plan. One option costs just as

On the old plan, students paid a Hat

funds for leftover meals. I he individual
costs of breakfast, lunch and dinner were
five, seven and nine dollars, respectively.
"I waste a lot less food," said Rincona

now eats less at meals. "I make sure I eat

Some Wilbur diners complained about the increased lines as a result of switching from the all
you-can-eat meal plan to the a la carte plan.
With the new system, some
items contain multiple types of
food on one plate, and the items
cannot he bought individually; in
stead, residents must buy the en
tire plate lor die allotted price.
"It's hard to get side orders and
a well-balanced meal," Lac lie said.
Most students said that, since
the shift, their eating habits have
either not changed or that they
have started to eat less.
"Food is definitely more expen
sive," said Kinconada freshman
Dante Cassanego. "[The new sys
tem] discourages you from taking
little things."

Cassanego said he has eaten
substantially fewer bananas since
the switch.
Students also complained
about the cost of refilling drinks,
paying for condiments and the
long lines tli.it have appeared
under the new plan.
Furthermore, main cited the
cost of food as unclear, so residents
do not know how much they are
spending until < heck-out.
"I have no idea [how much
items cost |," said Kinconada junior
1 'eel Williams.
Students who said they ate less
under the new system said they
spent around $8 on lunc li and any
where from $9-13 on dinner â€”
more than the pcr-meal price of
tin- all-you-can-eat plan.
The new system has raised con

cerns about how students' eating
habits will be affected, especially
among freshmen, many of whom
dine at Wilbur.
"I feel that it definitely puts con
straints on students, especially for
freshmen for whom it's a new ex
perience eating in a dining hall,"
Junipero RA LaChe said. "It puts
pressure on them not to spend
money [and] encourages people to
alter their eating habits in ways
that are not necessarily healthy."
Ultimately, because students
have been made more conscious
about their dining choices by the a
la c arte system, they say that some
sacrifices must be made.
"I don't have dessert any more
at all," said ('.assanego.
Williams added, "I don't even
think about dessert."
