## The 						Stanford Daily Remember the deeds of all civil rights heroes 
### 
Published Since IS*)I

As Stanford students look forward to t lit*
upcoming three-day weekend, few real
ly stop to think about the man and the
phenomenon that made this holiday
possible. In response, the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Celebration Committee has planned a two
week program entitled, "Just Plain Folks: A Cel
ebration of Unsung Heroes," to celebrate and
reflect on the legacy of King and the civil rights
movement in general. As the title suggests, this
year's program will focus on the unrecognized
activists and participants in the civil rights move
ment, and the members of the black community
that made King s achievements possible.
Far away from the deep South where Martin
Luther King. Jr.'sleadership skills were forged in
the fires of segregation, Stanford seems like an

unlikely place to find a strong connection to
King and his followers. 1 lowever, Stanford is ac -
tually uniquely situated to celebrate the legacy of
King, and King continues to influence the Stan
ford community.
Stanford is the site of the Martin Luther King
Papers Project, which houses an extensive col
lection of King's writings and records. It also is
the center of important research on the man and
the era. History Prof. Clay Carson, head of the
project, is one of the pre-eminent scholars on
King and his works.
In addition, this holiday is a chance for Stan
ford's vibrant and ac tive African-American com
munity to display its unity and celebrate its her
itage. Indeed, all of Stanford should celebrate
and commemorate those'who contributed to the

civil rights movement.
King's impact, however, is broader than sim
ply as an important African-American leader.
King is truly an American icon and his story is
part of our collective American history, for peo
ple of all races. The civil rights movement set the
tone for the modern conception of social move
ments and activism and King himself became a
legend, both in life and death.
This tends to obscure the fact that King
was just a mere human. Like many heroes of
American lore, our generation takes King's
contributions for granted. We treat them as if
they were inevitable, a fait accompli. We fail to
comprehend the failures and setbacks that
came before the victories, the very tenuous
ness of all these accomplishments, and the

fact that they very well could not have hap
pened without the faith and perseverance of
average people.
Thus, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day otters us
an opportune time not only to reflect on our past
but to consider the present state of race relations
in our community and in our country. It is easy
to feel complacent when we see how far we've
come, but the bleak truth is bigotry and igno
rance are still virulent, if not as blatant, econom
ic inequalities are still embedded in our social
structure and inspiring leaders can be few and
far between. The c ivil rights movement is histo
ry but its message is not. It would serve us well to
model our own actions upon the spirit and ded
ication of King and the many, many faceless
heroes of that time.
