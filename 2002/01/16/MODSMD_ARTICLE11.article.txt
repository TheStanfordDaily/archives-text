Legislative analyst: Gov.
Davis budget 'overly
optimistic'
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Gray Davis' budget
plan relies on "overly optimistic" assumptions and
could result in a multibillion dollar deficit in the fu
ture, Legislative Analyst Elizabeth I till said yesterday.
Davis overestimated revenues and the federal
money California will receive and his estimate of edu
cation costs is too low, according to the initial analysis
by the Legislature's top economic adviser.
Also, because the Davis plan relies on one-time so
lutions and deferred spending to plug budget gaps, it
could leave the state with a $4 billion shortfall in the
budget year after next, Hill said.
Fhe $100 billion plan uses spending c uts, delerred
spending and loans to lill an estimated $12.5 billion
budget shortfall over the next 18 months, l he budget
proposal includes $5.2 billion in spending cuts, includ
ing deep reductions to health and welfare programs.
