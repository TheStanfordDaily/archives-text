### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As a part of this year's Martin Luther King.
Jr. celebrations, members of the Stanford com
munity will have an opportunity to catch a
glimpse of the Freedom Summer ol 1904
through the work of famed New York photog
rapher Herbert Randall.
In the summer of 1964, Randall went to Hat
tiesburg, Miss., to document the summer's ac
tivities. His photographs show the many volun
teers who came to Mississippi to join with local
citizens in support of the Freedom Deincxratic
Party, with an emphasis on voter registration
and freedom schools.
"I wanted to capture what was going on that
summer," Randall said in an interview. "Not too
many people even know what happened."
l he photographs' contents range from ral
lies and voter registration canvassing to segre
gationist violence.
Randall said he tried to recreate the emotions
he experienced during the summer.
" l he main emotion was to sec that all kinds
of people from all over could come and make
something work," he said. "People can change
things if they get together and do it."
After the freedom summer, Randall donat
ed the negatives to the University of Southern
Mississippi.
Dr. l ony Lewis, director of the university's
Museum of Art, said, "Randall's photographs
document, with humanity and high aesthetic
quality, the activities of Freedom Summer,
when approximately 1,000 volunteers came to
Mississippi from all over America to help Black
Mississippians achieve their Constitutional
right to vote."
According to Black Community Services
Center Director Jan Barker-Alexander, Ran
dall's Freedom Summer photography was c ho

week celebrations because the pictures reflect
the celebration's theme, "Just Plain Folks: A
Celebration of Unsung I leroes."

"These candid photos show 'plain folks' in
battle lor their freedom," Alexander said.
" These are the loot soldiers of the Civil Rights
Movement whose names did not make your his
toiy book."
The exhibition features photographs that
have never been seen before, with the exception
of a few that were released to the national wire
system.
Bob Beyers, a former director of Stanford
News Service, was in Mississippi at the same
time as Randall.

" The real heroes were the local people,"
Beyers said. "They organized to try and win the
right to vote and in the process lost their homes
and their jobs, and some their lives."
These heroes are depicted in Randall's pho
tography.
I'he exhibit opens tonight at 7 p.m. in
