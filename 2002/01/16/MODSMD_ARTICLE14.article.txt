## The
						Stanford Daily Welcoming a campus voice for the center-left 
### 
Published Since 189]

Last week, the campus community
caught its first glimpse of the long
awaited Stanford Progressive, a new
left-of-center political journal. The
Progressive fills an important void on a cam
pus that is not only lacking political dialogue,
but also lacking a regularly published, main
stream political journal in which students can
express their views.
We welcome the idea behind the Progres
sive, as it serves the vital, dual functions of
bringing additional political discussion to
campus and providing a counterweight to the
Stanford Review.
For nearly two decades, the Review has
been the only established political journal on
campus. However, the Review's monopoly on
political publication and its Ã¼biquity belie its
respect level among undergraduates. The be
liefs and opinions expressed in the Review are
not representative of the overall political atti

tude on campus.
The first issue of the Progressive is impres
sive for its quality writing, innovative polling
and professional-looking layout. However, the
most appealing aspect of the nascent publica
tion is its common-sense, center-left content.
Too often, left-leaning college students are
lumped together with socialists, revolution
aries and radical "perma-protesters" and are
thus caricatured as out-of-touch, spoiled
brats. Besides providing humor for conser
vatives, this makes moderates reluctant to
label themselves "liberal," or "progressive."
Progressive President Josh Benson ac
knowledges the problems wrought by the
radical left when he writes that the "excesses
of political correctness and curriculum re
form in the early 1990s have often left the
academic and political climate on this cam
pus poisoned."
The opinion essays on pages and five and

eight showed readers that the Progressive will
not be a mouthpiece for reflexive anti-Ameri
can liberalism. One encourages the concepts
of social protest and organized resistance, but
only when done so in a straightforward man
ner. Another challenges protesters on the real
world practicality of their ideas. Both pieces
discredit those who protest government poli
cies, but who themselves have no better poli
cies to propose.
Our only worry about the Progressive con
cerns its future. Too many times we have seen
fledgling publications arise on campus, pub
lish one or two issues and fold due to lack of
interest or the graduation of its founders.
The Progressive has secured ASSU funding,
which strengthens, but does not guarantee,
its future prospects.
Now, to prevent itself from suffering a pre
mature collapse, the Progressive needs to take
two important steps.

First, the staff needs to make sure that it
keeps its pledge to publish new issues bi
quarterly, thus enabling the magazine to
build a consistent reader base. While this
point seems obvious, the temptation fora
new publication to forego issue regularity be
cause of academic projects, papers and
exams can be great.
Second, and more importantly, the Pro
gressive must recruit young talent to become
its future leadership. This means finding
thoughtful and dedicated freshmen and
sophomores who will become the Progres
sive's future writers and editors, thus ensur
ing that the publication exist far beyond its
founders' time at Stanford.
Given the general lack of campus political
debate, and more specifically of a main
stream political journal, the Progressive has
the potential to serve an important purpose
to the Stanford campus for years to come.
