## Grad housing: out in the cold 
### 
Stanford University leaves its students out in the
cold. In some high-rises, heat was not fully
turned up this December until temperatures
dipped into the chilling 30s. The reason? (ireedv
managers in the Graduate Housing Office wanted to
save money to pay for previous renovations and to build
their war chest for future development, l'hey broke
their own housing policy, violated the law in (California
and abused the trust of the graduate student bod v.

The Housing Policies and Services
guidebook c laims that heat is turned
on whenever there is "a consistent
lower temperature for several clays in a
row." We had that in September. The
average low was 52 degrees for nine
straight days. I fowever, management
did not turn on the heat. They never
told us what "lower temperature" they
were looking for. And thev never told

us when that mark was finally hit. That's because they
did not follow the policy printed in their own handbook.
A woman named Diane Conklin single-handedly
decides when to turn on the heat in graduate high-rise
buildings. 1 hat information is not in your guidebook.
And housing officials are reluctant to admit that Con
klin is the only person with this kind of authority.
When asked, facilities supervisor Rebecca Benadaret
said "I couldn't tell you." When asked if it was Diane
Conklin, Benadaret said "yes." All roads lead to Con
klin. Yet, this woman is harder to reach than the Wiz
ard of ()/. She does not return phone calls or e-mail
messages. At best, she asks an assistant to respond to an
occasional message.
While Conklin refused to t.ikc phone calls, tempera
tures dropped throughout September and October.
I he average low in the first two weeks of C)ctober was 48
degrees. As late as mid-October, Conklin had not given
notice for the boiler at 63 Abrams (iourt to be turned on.
A technician turned on the boiler for "testing" purposes
in mid-October but room temperatures remained low.
In November, it was still cold and management refused
to turn the boiler to full capacity. In mid-December, they
turned up the boiler and student apartment became sig
nificantly warmer.
I heir stubborn refusal to turn on the heat in
September and early October violated health regula
tions of the state of California. Residents of 63 Abrams
Court and other high-rises spent the fall in "substan
dard buildings" according to the California Health it-
Safety (lode. Section 17920.3, which states that "lack of
adequate heating" is sufficient grounds for an apart
ment dwelling to be considered "a substandard build
ing." Many students at Stanford University, scared to
set foot in Fast Palo Alto, probably never dreamed
they'd be living in"a substandard building" on their
very own campus.
Welcome to the world of "substandard" housing.
California regulations make it clear that "[ejvery
dwelling unit and guest room used or offered for rent
or lease shall continue to be provided with heating fa
cilities capable of maintaining a minimum room tem
perature of 70 degrees." Dwellings that fall below 70
degrees are "substandard" according to the Califor
nia Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 34, which
fleshes out the general provisions of the California
Health & Safety Code. My apartment consistently fell
below 70 degrees in September and October. That
was against the law.
It was also morally wrong. Students have a right to
warm and comfortable accommodations. We do much
of our studying at home. Nevertheless, supervisor

Fran/ Rloberdan/ told me in mid-November that man
agement has the following policy: to not provide heat
above 71 degrees. That ceiling would be one degree
above the minimum required by law. Goincidence? 1
think not.
My room temperature never exceeded 71-73 degrees
in September, October, November and the first half of
December. It frequently dipped into the 60s and 50s.
You might think students should receive equal ac
cess to warm accommodations. Not true at Stanford,
rhe policy of (iraduate I lousing ()perations is to turn
on the heat at family dormitories first and, later, to
turn on the heat for couples living at Abrams Court
and other high-rises.
1 hat is wrong. Students gel just as cold as children.
1 he only difference is that our primary lobbyists (i.e. our
mothers) are farther away and they can't raise heck
when their children are left out in the cold.
()n Dec. 13, Gonklin sent an e-mail message to every
graduate student in residence declaring that "Califor
nia's energy crisis has affected. Stanford in sky-high en
erg)- rates being charged the- University." Seven copies of
this message were posted in the foyer and elevators of 63
Abrams Court. It was the first time we had heard from
(Conklin in three months. The Wizard had spoken.
She followed up with flyers posted in the dormitories
in December and January with the message "conserve
energy." The problem with her message is, first, that it
should be the job of each student to determine the ap
propriate balance between personal comfort and con
servation. Not the- University. That's why we have ther
mostats in our apartments.
One graduate student in a Ph.D. program told me
that I loskins is the coldest dorm he's ever lived in. Ife
now lives at 03 Abrams (Court, 112 lis wife wears long-jobns
to bed to stay warm, l'hey use two quilts. He admits his
thermostat has said 75 degrees when "it didn't feel like
75." 1 hat's because the thermostats are inaccurate.
Many couples have purchased their own ther
mostats because they don't trust the ones installed by
management.
I he second problem with Gonklin s sinoke-and-mir
rors campaign is that she's wrong. Energy prices have
not risen. In fact, they declined 17.2 percent over the
course of 2001. They started out high but steadily
dropped. The price of "residential natural gas," which is
used in boilers under 63 Abrams Court and other high
rises, chopped 33 percent during 2001, according to sea
sonally adjusted statistics provided by the U.S. Depart
ment of labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
We pay close to market rates for our apartments
(about $1 100/ month), and we deserve full heat and
control over our thermostats. Stanford must be making
a mint. This land was deeded to the University by the
Stanford family. The most value part of our dormitories,
the property underneath, has Ix-en handed to the Grad
uate Housing Office for responsible management. Un
like most developers in Palo Alto, they didn't have to pay
for it. Therefore, our rents should be significantly lower
than rents in Palo Alto. But they aren't.
We need thermostats with accurate readings that
work. Management should keep the boiler at full capac -
ity in the fall, winter and spring. Ix't residents adjust
their own temperatures. I lave an educational campaign
on energy conservation. Respond immediately to all
messages. Remember that students arc the customers.
We pay the bills that keep the university running.
Above all, don't leave us out in the cold.

Safety (lode. Section 17920.3, which states that "lack of
adequate heating" is sufficient grounds for an apart
ment dwelling to be considered "a substandard build
ing." Many students at Stanford University, scared to
set foot in Fast Palo Alto, probably never dreamed
they'd be living in"a substandard building" on their
very own campus.
Welcome to the world of "substandard" housing.
California regulations make it clear that "[ejvery
dwelling unit and guest room used or offered for rent
or lease shall continue to be provided with heating fa
cilities capable of maintaining a minimum room tem
perature of 70 degrees." Dwellings that fall below 70
degrees are "substandard" according to the Califor
nia Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 34, which
fleshes out the general provisions of the California
Health & Safety Code. My apartment consistently fell
below 70 degrees in September and October. That
was against the law.
It was also morally wrong. Students have a right to
warm and comfortable accommodations. We do much
of our studying at home. Nevertheless, supervisor

Fran/ Rloberdan/ told me in mid-November that man
agement has the following policy: to not provide heat
above 71 degrees. That ceiling would be one degree
above the minimum required by law. Goincidence? 1
think not.
My room temperature never exceeded 71-73 degrees
in September, October, November and the first half of
December. It frequently dipped into the 60s and 50s.
You might think students should receive equal ac
cess to warm accommodations. Not true at Stanford,
rhe policy of (iraduate I lousing ()perations is to turn
on the heat at family dormitories first and, later, to
turn on the heat for couples living at Abrams Court
and other high-rises.
1 hat is wrong. Students gel just as cold as children.
1 he only difference is that our primary lobbyists (i.e. our
mothers) are farther away and they can't raise heck
when their children are left out in the cold.
()n Dec. 13, Gonklin sent an e-mail message to every
graduate student in residence declaring that "Califor
nia's energy crisis has affected. Stanford in sky-high en
erg)- rates being charged the- University." Seven copies of
this message were posted in the foyer and elevators of 63
Abrams Court. It was the first time we had heard from
(Conklin in three months. The Wizard had spoken.
She followed up with flyers posted in the dormitories
in December and January with the message "conserve
energy." The problem with her message is, first, that it
should be the job of each student to determine the ap
propriate balance between personal comfort and con
servation. Not the- University. That's why we have ther
mostats in our apartments.
One graduate student in a Ph.D. program told me
that I loskins is the coldest dorm he's ever lived in. Ife
now lives at 03 Abrams (Court, 112 lis wife wears long-jobns
to bed to stay warm, l'hey use two quilts. He admits his
thermostat has said 75 degrees when "it didn't feel like
75." 1 hat's because the thermostats are inaccurate.
Many couples have purchased their own ther
mostats because they don't trust the ones installed by
management.
I he second problem with Gonklin s sinoke-and-mir
rors campaign is that she's wrong. Energy prices have
not risen. In fact, they declined 17.2 percent over the
course of 2001. They started out high but steadily
dropped. The price of "residential natural gas," which is
used in boilers under 63 Abrams Court and other high
rises, chopped 33 percent during 2001, according to sea
sonally adjusted statistics provided by the U.S. Depart
ment of labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
We pay close to market rates for our apartments
(about $1 100/ month), and we deserve full heat and
control over our thermostats. Stanford must be making
a mint. This land was deeded to the University by the
Stanford family. The most value part of our dormitories,
the property underneath, has Ix-en handed to the Grad
uate Housing Office for responsible management. Un
like most developers in Palo Alto, they didn't have to pay
for it. Therefore, our rents should be significantly lower
than rents in Palo Alto. But they aren't.
We need thermostats with accurate readings that
work. Management should keep the boiler at full capac -
ity in the fall, winter and spring. Ix't residents adjust
their own temperatures. I lave an educational campaign
on energy conservation. Respond immediately to all
messages. Remember that students arc the customers.
We pay the bills that keep the university running.
Above all, don't leave us out in the cold.

Stanford University leaves its students out in the
cold. In some high-rises, heat was not fully
turned up this December until temperatures
dipped into the chilling 30s. The reason? (ireedv
managers in the Graduate Housing Office wanted to
save money to pay for previous renovations and to build
their war chest for future development, l'hey broke
their own housing policy, violated the law in (California
and abused the trust of the graduate student bod v.

The Housing Policies and Services
guidebook c laims that heat is turned
on whenever there is "a consistent
lower temperature for several clays in a
row." We had that in September. The
average low was 52 degrees for nine
straight days. I fowever, management
did not turn on the heat. They never
told us what "lower temperature" they
were looking for. And thev never told

us when that mark was finally hit. That's because they
did not follow the policy printed in their own handbook.
A woman named Diane Conklin single-handedly
decides when to turn on the heat in graduate high-rise
buildings. 1 hat information is not in your guidebook.
And housing officials are reluctant to admit that Con
klin is the only person with this kind of authority.
When asked, facilities supervisor Rebecca Benadaret
said "I couldn't tell you." When asked if it was Diane
Conklin, Benadaret said "yes." All roads lead to Con
klin. Yet, this woman is harder to reach than the Wiz
ard of ()/. She does not return phone calls or e-mail
messages. At best, she asks an assistant to respond to an
occasional message.
While Conklin refused to t.ikc phone calls, tempera
tures dropped throughout September and October.
I he average low in the first two weeks of C)ctober was 48
degrees. As late as mid-October, Conklin had not given
notice for the boiler at 63 Abrams (iourt to be turned on.
A technician turned on the boiler for "testing" purposes
in mid-October but room temperatures remained low.
In November, it was still cold and management refused
to turn the boiler to full capacity. In mid-December, they
turned up the boiler and student apartment became sig
nificantly warmer.
I heir stubborn refusal to turn on the heat in
September and early October violated health regula
tions of the state of California. Residents of 63 Abrams
Court and other high-rises spent the fall in "substan
dard buildings" according to the California Health it-
