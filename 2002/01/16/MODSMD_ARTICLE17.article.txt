Norway references 'near-racisf and 'reactionary'
I have generally resisted writing to the Daily
for various reasons, but I felt compelled to do so
this time by the letter from Ben Ho printed on
Jan. 15th. I take issue with his near racist remarks
that "the Norwegian countries are monolithic
blond-haired blue-eyed Aryans who share a ha
tred for immigration and diversity equaled only
by Pat Buchanan."
First of all, I am personally embarrassed that a
Stanford doctoral candidate would use the phrase
"the Norwegian states" or "the Norwegian coun
tries." One would think that it wouldn't be so hard
to separate Norway from the rest of Scandinavia. Do
we call all of Latin America"the Mexican states?"
Secondly, has Mr. I lo ever been to Norway? On
what does he base his claim that all Norwegians hate
immigration and diversity? I know several Norwe
gian people, one of whom is of clearly Afric an de
scent. I can assure you that she is perfectly happy
being Norwegian and does feel any animosity from
the "Aryans" who share her country.
I am not going to go into a critique of the entire
article, for I could fill pages. I would just like to say
that there is no better example of the type of "reac
tionary" right-wing politics and "social regression"
which Mr. Ho purports to reject than his own re
marks about Norway.

Marguerite needs new routes for commuters
I live about four miles from Stanford. The two
bus lines that pass by my house take about 12 min
utes to go to the I'alo Alto Transit Center (a.k.a. Palo
Alto Caltrain station). 1 work in the Gates Building,
a two-minute walk from the Quad. All this should
make me an ideal candidate to take public transit to
work .. .so why don't Ido it more often?

1 he answer is the Marguerite. Because of their
circuitous routes, the Marguerite takes 12 to 15
minutes (in the best case) to travel between the
Oval and the Palo Alto Transit Center, a straight
line distance of just three-fourths of a mile mile
along Palm Drive. In good weather 1 can walk
this distance just as quickly, but in bad weather or
fora slower walker, this would not be a pleasant
alternative.
Worse, Marguerite runs through areas of heavy
traffic congestion, such as the Shopping Center and
the left turn onto Palm Drive from southbound tl
Camino, so at commute hours the buses frequently
run several minutes late. Because Caltrain and most
public buses leave the Palo Alto station on time,
even a small deviation from the Marguerite
timetable can easily result in missed connections,
making it impossible to rely on the Marguerite's
timetable for trip planning.
Why not run an express shuttle service between
the Oval and Caltrain along Palm Drive?
Such a shuttle would better serve bus and train
commuters, since its travel time would be shorter
and less delay-prone and would provide faster ac
cess to downtown Palo Alto during lunch hours.
(The Downtown Express almost accomplishes this,
but it only runs in the middle of the day, not during
commute hours). Many central campus classrooms
and offices are within a short walk of the Oval, and
other Marguerite routes already bring people to
central campus from outlying areas.
With increasing traffic, campus parking shortages
and the high cost of car ownership, we must consider
public transit as a serious alternative. Our nearby tran
sit center is served by a comfortable commuter train
(Palo Alto is the second-busiest Caltrain station after
San Francisco), as well as local and express buses to ev
erywhere in the Bay Area. ITie Marguerite can do a
lot to make the commute to Stanford more pleasant by
getting this simple connection right.
