WASHINGTON (AP) â€”The
Bush administration will charge
American 1 aliban John Walker
Linclh with conspiracy to kill
U.S. citi/ens in Afghanistan and
will ask for life imprisonment
rather than the death penalty,
Attorney General John Ashcroft
siiid yesterday.
l.indh will be cliarged in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va.,
rather than in a military tribunal.
Other charges against him will in
clude providing support to terror
ist organizations and engaging in
prohibited transactions with the
I aliban, Ashcroft said.
I he attorney general said that
while the United States continues
to seek justice against foreigners
responsible for the Sept. 1 1 at
tacks in New York and Washing
ion, "we cannot overlook attacks
on America when they come from
U.S. citizens."
White I louse spokesman Ari
Fleischer said President Bush "is
supportive of the process put in
place. He is confident that the
process will end in justice."

The charges were recom
mended to hush by the National
Security Council, which mediat
ed advice from the Justice De
partment, the Pentagon and the
State Department.
"Youth is not absolution for
treachery," Ashcroft told re
porters. "Misdirected Americans
cannot receive direction in mur
derous ideology."
Lindh is 20.
He was captured in Novem
ber fighting with the Taliban in
Afghanistan. He was taken into
custody by U.S. forces after a
prison uprising at a fortress in
the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif. Lindh since then
has been held on the amphibious
attack ship USS Bataan in the
Arabian Sea.
A baptized Roman Catholic
who converted to Islam at 16,
Lindh sent a letter to his parents in
December saying he was safe and
regretted not contacting them
sooner. He apparently dictated
the letter, dated Dec. to an In
ternational Red Cross volunteer.
Ashcroft said the charges were
based for the most part on
Lindh's own statements to FBI
investigators.
According to Ashcroft, Lindh
told agents that he joined a ter

rorist training camp in
Afghanistan last May and spent
seven months there. Osama bin
Laden visited the camp several
times and met Lindh on one oc -
casion, Lindh said.
In the criminal complaint, the
government said that Lindh was
interviewed by the FBI on Dec. 9
and 10 and waived his rights to a
lawyer. 1 le had joined the military
training c amp in May 2001. it said,
and was told by al-Qaida people to
pretend that he was Irish and not
to admit to anyone that he was
American.
'Flie complaint also said that
Lindh learned in early June that
bin Laden had sent people to the
United States to carry out suicide
operations and that Lindh re
mained at the camp for the
seven-week duration after he
learned about the plan to carry
out an attack.
On one occasion, the com
plaint said, Lindh and four other
trainees met with bin Laden for
about five minutes, during which
time bin Laden thanked them for
helping.
On Sept. 11 or 12, it said, Lindh
heard about the U.S. attackson the
radio and understood bin Laden
had ordered them and that addi
tional attacks would follow.
