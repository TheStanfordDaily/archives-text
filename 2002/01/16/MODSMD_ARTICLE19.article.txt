## Innovation Surprise, surprise, multivitamins are good for you 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Multivitamins may be good
for you. Iti the New England
Journal of Medicine, re
searchers found that modest
Vitamin shortfalls can have se
rious consequences, and that
those taking sup p 1 em en t s
seem to be at lesser risk. Vita
min B reduces neural tube de
lects in embryos and coronary
blockage, and vitamin E re
duces risk of heart disease by
half. This does not mean one
should get loaded; it merely

suggests that supplements in
moderation do not hurt — as
recently feared — and can

help. As a side note, our bod
ies absorb vitamins best when
it comes in natural foods, fol
lowed by exercise.
America is a nation of fatties.
Philadelphia, famous for its
cheese-steak sandwiches and for
being the fattest city in the coun
try, now has an official program
encouraging people to exercise.
One-third of adult Americans are
overweight and, according to a re
cent study, this trend is

now affecting children.
Among white children, the
rate jumped from eight
percent to 12 percent. The
problem is most acute
among black and Hispanic
kids: more than 20 per
cent are overweight today,
double the rate of 12 years
ago. The culprits are what
every mom knows all too
well: too many soft drinks,

too much fast food, too much time
spent sitting in front of the televi
sion and computer and too little
exercise.

Mosquitoes may be the first
proof of genetic adaptation to
global warming. Geologists at
the University of Oregon dis
covered that the North Ameri
can pitcher-plant mosquito,
Wyeomya smilhii, is now hiber
nating later in winter. The in
sect uses the number of day
light hours to judge when to
start hibernating. The ecolo
gists found these mosquitoes
are waiting nine days longer
than their ancestors in 1972.
For over three decades, the
same scientists have been ( rear
ing artificial light conditions lot
wild insects and have found
that animals can change their
physiology in as little as five
years. God creates man, man
warms Earth . . . mosquitoes
inherit Earth?
Will nuclear power be the
messiah for mankind? With oil
reserves depleting and hydro
gen fusion an expensive
dream, safer and more eco
nomical nuclear plants may be

the solution. Recently, engi
neers have made improve

ments such as fuel pellets that
do not melt and degrade slow
ly, as well as better cooling sys
tems. The plants can also
process the same uranium
many times for better efficien
cy. Nuclear power has the ad
vantage that it does not pro
duce carbon dioxide and pro
duces cheaper energy than
solar or wind power. The US
currently has 103 nuclear
plants, which crank out a fifth
of the nation's electrical out
put. No new plants have been
ordered since 1978, though.

At the stroke of New Year's
Eve, physicists around the

world had another rea
son to rejoice: the cre
ation of the first quan
tum computer. About
two weeks ago, IBM Al
maden Lab, in conjunc
tion with Stanford re
searchers, announced
they were able to factor
15 into 3 and 5 using
such a device. A quan

tum computer uses electron
movement and states, and
might be able to perform calcu
lations deemed impossible
today. The creators have not
published many details yet, but
said their machine is still very
primitive compared to today's
standards. Quantum comput
ers, however, have theoretically
enormous potential and far
reaching implications. For in
stance, encryption is based on
factoring which is a difficult
problem; being able to solve
that would mean no system
would be safe.
