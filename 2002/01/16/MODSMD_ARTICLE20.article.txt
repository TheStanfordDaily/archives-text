LONG DISTANCE SHARKS: Great
white sharks have long been believed to live
close to shore, seldom swimming beyond the
temperate coastal waters that provide their
food — such as those off (California, Australia
and Southern Africa. A surprising study by
U( '.-Santa (>ruz and Stanford scientists shows
how wrong such a belief is, and how little is
known about the lives of sea creatures.
The study found that the white shark
thrives in a broad range of waters, spanning
thousands of miles out to sea. In 1999 and
2000, the researchers attached satellite
archival tags to the backs of six adult sharks.
The tags recorded data every two minutes
on water depth, temperature and light. Each
tag was programmed to come off its shark on
a specific date and rise up to the ocean sur
face, where it would transmit information to
a satellite monitored by scientists. Upon ana
lyzing the data, the scientists found that, in
autumn, the six sharks had all remained
close to the California shore as expected, in
winter, though, four of the sharks went out
to sea. One male swam 2,280 miles from off
the coast of San Francisco to near Maui, re
turning in the spring. The other three voy
agers swam to subtropical waters hundreds
of miles west of Baja, Calif., remaining there
for months.
PLACEBOS' EFFECTS ON THE
BRAIN: 1 'eople have known for years about

the placebo effect in depression patients,
where a sufferer improves after undergoing
a sham treatment or taking a fake drug. A
study led by I)r. Andrew Leuchter of UCLA
has shown for the first time that people who
improve with a placebo experience a change
in brain function. The change is different
from that caused by medication, but signifi
cant nonetheless.
Leuchter and his colleagues gave 51 sub
jects either an antidepressant or a placebo
and examined their brain activity with quan
titative electroencephalography (QEEG)
imaging. For both groups, there were
changes in the brain's prefrontal cortex.
1 lowever, the changes occurred at different
rates: the medication acted almost immedi
ately, while the placebo effect took two
weeks. Another key difference was that the
medication suppressed prefrontal activity,
while placebo subjects reporting improve
ment had an increase in activity. The find
ings indic ate that there is more than one way
of alleviating depression. 1 hey also suggest
that the act of seeking treatment is itself ther
apeutic. With better understanding of the
placebo effect, new treatments utilizing it
may be developed.
GAS, LIQUID .. . PATTERNED
FLUID? When rubidium gas is cooled to
().()()()()()()() I of a degree above absolute zero,
the atoms form the Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC), combining into a single quantum
stateand flowing without friction. The matter
is said to be a superfluid, with no viscosity. In
1995, BEC was created for the first time.
Now, something new about BEC has been
discovered. Immanuel Bloch and other
physicists at the Ludwig-Maximilians Uni
versity in Germany found that under certain
circumstances, the BEC switches from a su
perfluid to another, new state of matter.
They call it "patterned fluid."
