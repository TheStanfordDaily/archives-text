.A Work/Study Program
Several Stanford students have found
a great way to land a job with a startup
company this summer by applying to the
Mayfield Fellows Program. This highly
selective program, run by the Stanford
Technology Ventures Program (STYP),
offers science or engineering students a
unique work/study opportunity in an
emerging technology startup.
Each year, the Mayfield Fellows
Program selects a dozen students from
nearly 100 applicants for an intensive
nine-month work / study program.
This program is designed to develop a
theoretical and practical understand
ing of the techniques for growing
emerging technology companies. It
also combines an intense sequence of
courses on the management of tech
nology ventures, a paid summer in
ternship at a staft-up company, a fol
low up seminar in the fall and ongoing
guidance with various mentors. These
mentors include an MFP alumni men
tor, a venture capital mentor and a
mentor from the management of their
internship startup.
Armen Rerjikly and Melissa Miao,
both Management Science & Engineer
ing masters students, completed the
Mayfield Fellows Program in December
of this past year.
Berjikly was a summer intern at Ech
elon Corporation, which makes hard
ware and software for networking
everyday devices.
"It was fascinating to work at this ex
tremely innovative company," Berjikly
said. "With their technology you can ail

tomate an entire building and then con
trol it over the Internet."
He added that being a part of the
Mayfield Fellows Program opened up
opportunities that lie might not have
had otherwise.
"During the summer my status as a
Mayfield Fellow provided me with a
'Irackstage pass' to all types of upper
management-only situations, such as ex
ecutive and strategy meetings. Even
though all my past experiences were in
engineering, I was thrilled to have a po
sition that gave me more perspective
about career options on the business side
of technology."
Miao wanted to find a company that
allowed her to do something that made
a positive impact on the world. As soon
as she met Mike Klein, the CEO of R2
Technology — which makes image en
hancement software for mammograms
— she realized that a high technology
company can have a socially responsible
mission.
"My internship focused on creating a
strategic plan for developing partner
ships and relationships with high pro
file advocacy groups across the nation,"
Miao said. "From the very first week, 1
was infected by the genuine passion of
each of R2's employees about the com
pany's technology and the impact of
their work on the lives of women across
the country. 1 also gained a broad per
spective on many of the key issues R2
faced as a rapidly growing start-up
company."
Miao added that she learned great
companies are made up of more than
just strong technology.
"One of the greatest insights I gained
from the summer is that a great technol
ogy does not sell itself. Without a CEO to

lead a young company through financ
ing, positioning and marketing, even the
most revolutionary technology can dis
appear into obscurity.
In addition to the value of the sum
mer internship, Miao stressed the qual
ity of the teaching and mentoring ex
perience within the Mayfield Fellows
Program.
" The faculty have gained a tremen
dous amount of respect from the outside
community for pioneering an incredibly
unique and entrepreneurial program,"
Miao said.
Tom Byers and Tina Seelig, MFP
Co-Directors, have guided over seven
ty students through the program over
the past six years.
"This program has changed the tra
jectory of many of these students'
lives," Seelig said. With the help of a
large teaching team and several men
tors, these students get an in-depth
look at the world of high technology
entrepreneurship.

as she met Mike Klein, the CEO of R2
Technology — which makes image en
hancement software for mammograms
— she realized that a high technology
company can have a socially responsible
mission.
"My internship focused on creating a
strategic plan for developing partner
ships and relationships with high pro
file advocacy groups across the nation,"
Miao said. "From the very first week, 1
was infected by the genuine passion of
each of R2's employees about the com
pany's technology and the impact of
their work on the lives of women across
the country. 1 also gained a broad per
spective on many of the key issues R2
faced as a rapidly growing start-up
company."
Miao added that she learned great
companies are made up of more than
just strong technology.
"One of the greatest insights I gained
from the summer is that a great technol
ogy does not sell itself. Without a CEO to

lead a young company through financ
ing, positioning and marketing, even the
most revolutionary technology can dis
appear into obscurity.
In addition to the value of the sum
mer internship, Miao stressed the qual
ity of the teaching and mentoring ex
perience within the Mayfield Fellows
Program.
" The faculty have gained a tremen
dous amount of respect from the outside
community for pioneering an incredibly
unique and entrepreneurial program,"
Miao said.
Tom Byers and Tina Seelig, MFP
Co-Directors, have guided over seven
ty students through the program over
the past six years.
"This program has changed the tra
jectory of many of these students'
lives," Seelig said. With the help of a
large teaching team and several men
tors, these students get an in-depth
look at the world of high technology
entrepreneurship.
