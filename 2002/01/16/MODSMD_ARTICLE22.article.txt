# A 						beginner's guide to start-ups: from start to finish
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Genius is two percent inspiration and
98 percent perspiration." These famous
words attributed to inventor Thomas
Alva Edison are unfortunately not quite
correct fora start-up company. Rather,
success is two percent inspiration, 51 per
cent venture capital, and the rest hard
perspiration. Chough we would like to
idealistic alh believe that having the idea
of a better mousetrap is enough to create
a successful company, it is important not
to forget a key point: you have to ac tually
build it before they will come. This is the
point at which money becomes crucial,
and, unless the founders are fortunate
enough to be able to claim family ties to
Bill Gates, this means they need to seek
venture capital. I lowever, getting venture
capital is quite a different pnx ess than ap
plying to college.
"There isn't an application process; we
don't have to fund anyone," said George
Zachary, general partner of More, David
ow Ventures. "So we invest based on what
we believe is a big opportunity to make
money, not because we have to or not be
cause we need to. We're not a bank; we re

not a funding agency. We're here actual
ly as a partner to help build a company
and for that we have to believe the person
is committed to the suc cess of the compa
ny and they want us to contribute to it —
contribute to it monetarily, contribute to
it with ideas, contribute to it with rela
tionships."
The investor/inventor partnership is
beneficial for both parties. By giving
money and some other support, in
vestors receive dozens or even hundreds
of times more than they originally invest
ed. Inventors, who spent only their time,
expertise and a limited amount of money
for prototype — $20,000, for instance —
receive millions of dollars. For example,
when Edison started development of his
light bulb in 1878, Morgan Finance
Group initially invested $1 million. When
Edison left General Electric, which he
c reated, he sold his 10 percent of shares
for $5 million. General Electric itself was
worth much more and belonged com
pletely to the investors.
I he process to begin a company must
start with an idea. According to Zachary,
this has to be something about which you
are excited and to which you plan to de
vote a significant amount of time and

work. When you will be presenting your
idea for venture capital, there are sever
al issues that will have to be addressed.
"From the investor's side, the number
one question is, 'will people buy it?'"
Zachary said. "But the other questions are
going to be, 'does this address a big mar
ket?,' 'is this technology that has a big ad
vantage over other existing competitors?,'
'are this people great people from an exe
cution perspective?,' 'does this idea re
quire a rational amount of capital to be
successful instead of a hundred million
dollars; can you build a profitable compa
ny on a $10-20 million total investment?' "
If you plan to get the capital, your idea had
better fit these criteria.
"Find a great advisor or co-founder to
work on the idea with," Zachary said. "A
lot of times it is easy to get carried away in
your own mind about how great the thing
is that you're working on, and it's good to
hear from someone who's a co-founder or
advisor [about) what the weak points are
and to work on the weak points. Some
times the idea has so many weak points the
entire idea should be discarded." Flexibil
ity is important because even spending the
rest of your life on a weak idea won't get it
off the ground.

"The customers have to love [the idea]
and want to spend money on it now, ver
sus saying 'this is kind of nice, I can spend
money on it in a year.' So it has to be a
have-to-have versus a want-to-have. It
has to be what I call an aspirin, instead of
a vitamin. It has to solve a pain someone
has so they want to go out and buy it."
Throughout the whole process, timing
is key. "If you're starting too early, that
can be very painful," Zachary said. "You
have to start it at the right time of the
phase of the market, 100 early or too late
is not good."
Once these concerns are addressed,
you are ready to approach V( ,s. "We just
funded a couple companies fora quarter
million dollars which are seed investments
[for] very smart people pursuing big mar
kets," Zachary said. "I think the critical fac
tors in those seed companies 01 those in
vestments were smart people pursuing the
big idea, and a quarter million dollars al
lows them to kind of write the business
plan and build the prototype."
Don't worry about having a fully work
ing product quite yet. If you do, that's
great but not required.
"For the seed investments, it's some
smart people pursuing a pretty cool new

interesting area," Zachary said. "They
don't have to have a product, but certain
ly a prototype. It doesn't have to he the
world's best prototype, it just has to be
something that works from a demonstra
tion perspective."
"Besides having a great idea with a
great business, find a connection and a re
ferral to the venture capitalist you're try
ing to meet," said Zachary. "The reason
why is, every day, when I get lots of busi
ness plans, the ones I will read first are
from people that I know. [Send] a very
short description of what the purpose of
the company is and why it's doing what it's
doing; what it is and why it's going to lx
important."
Congratulations! You've managed to
obtain initial funding. This is quite a tough
feat.
"I've gotten 9,000 [proposals] in my six
years here, and I've funded nine. As a
group here, we probably get 4,000 to
5,000 per year. We have probably looked
at, in 17 years, 25,000 companies and
we've funded a couple hundred." Not
great odds, but youi idea was one they just
couldn't pass up.
When your roommate, who
sent out 200 CC emails to VC.s
across the country, conies to you
asking how you did it, tell him you
found out about the VC.s' back
grounds before you applied to a
select few.
"If someone sent me a plan on
engine technology for airplanes,
I'm not going to be the light per
son," Zac liary said. "We're focused
011 information technology, and
that covers enterprise software, in
frastructure software, networking,
semiconductors, that's the general
area. So one of the key things that
entrepreneurs should do is do
their research on who are the right
investors for what they want to do
because those investors have net
works of people to introduce the
entrepreneur to and those net
works of people can significantly
shape the success of a company."
II vou can't find someone pre
(isely in your field, you're not com-
out of luck.
"We're also open to brand new
interesting exciting areas in tech
nology Zac ban said. "Most of the
surviving investment firms are tar
geted towards technology areas
where there's some barrier that
the technology creates that stops
other competitors from doing it or
doing it easily."
Once vou have your product
.ind are ready to go, you should
have a basic idea of what to expect.
" I lie c< invent ional venture cap
ital deal, which is what we're back
to, is that at the end of the end of
the first round of investment, the

investors usually own around 50
percent of the company, the
founding group owns around 25
percent of the company, and
there's 25 percent allocated for
employees and future manage
ment," Zachary said.
Though the market seems
closed right now, that should not
keep you from trying.
"My guess it that a very few
amount of companies will be fund
ed, but c ertainly great ideas will be
funded," Zachary said.
"It's probably also important
to note — and Stanford is a great
example — [that] we spend a lot
of time working with research in
stitutions across the country,"
said Pamela Mahoney of More,
Davidow.
Zachary describes how your
idea will be evaluated: "I'll take a
look at the e-mail people send me
and I'll spend three minutes on it.
If I'm excited, I'll spend more
time, which usually means meet
ing with the company and listen
ing to their story. II I'm excited by
that story, then we'll jump into the
diligence phase, and that can last
two to six weeks; c hecking out the
tec hnology, using our network of
contacts of experience technolo
gists and businesspeople to under
stand if what the company has is
really valuable. We will rest the
idea against what people in indus
try think."
Nicely done — you've success
fully landed first round funding.
Now, you need to start moving for
ward. But, you're not going to be
on your own.
"Usually people that are institu
tional investors, like the majority
of very good venture capital in
vestors, take a seat on the board of
directors," Zacharv said. "I know

that I talk to the CEOs of my com
panies, in the first year of their ex
istence, probably every day, say
ing, 'Hey, did you think about
this?' or 'Let me introduce you to
this customer; let me introduce
you to this big potential corporate
partner; let me introduce you
some more investors for future
rounds.' Basically, it's providing
constant input, data and relation
ships that can really change the
outcome of a start-up. That's what
a good board of directors is sup
posed to do, not just sit there and
do nothing."
