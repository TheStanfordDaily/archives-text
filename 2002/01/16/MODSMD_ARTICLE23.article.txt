## No. 1 Card gets Pac-10 preview 
### MARK THOMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team (1-0) is sched
uled to be in two different places at the
same time, and it's not a mistake.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Friday-Sunday: No. 1 Stanford
will play split sauad at Pac-10 Indoors
at Seattle and National Collegiate Ten
nis Classic in Las Vegas

Friday through Monday, half the
team will compete at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoors in Seattle, Wash., and
the other half will play in the National
Collegiate Tennis Championships in Las
Vegas, Nev. A split-squad effort like this
is not uncommon and is in fact beneficial
in many ways, explained head coach Lele
Forood.
"It's really good to play two events be
cause that way we can get all nine players
into competition," she said.
The tournaments are the Cardinal's
final tuneup before starting the Pac-10
season on Jan. 26 against No. 11 Fresno
State.
"These tournaments are a good warm
up and just a chance to get some matches
under our belt before starting team
matches," senior Lauren Kalvaria said.
Due to the concurrent tournaments,
some players get to try new things, such

as playing a higher flight of singles than
they would normally get to play.
The two tournaments are different in
structure, but neither is necessarily more
important than the other.
The Pac-10 Indoors are just that —
an indoor tournament, played against
the same athletes that the Cardinal will
face once dual match play begins later
this month. The competition is flight
ed, meaning that teams rank their
players and those athletes compete
against other players of comparable
team ranking.
"You get to see the competition in
your conference," said sophomore
Lauren Barnikow, who will be playing
in the Indoors. "It's important to show
improvement and get comfortable."
The National Collegiate Tennis
Championships, on the other hand, are
played outdoors in sometimes-windy
Las Vegas. I"he competitors come from
all over the country for this non-flight
ed, basic draw tournament. Since most
of the competition is from conferences
other than the Pac-10, competing Car
dinal athletes focus on their own skills,
since (hey might not face another con
ference competitor.
"I'm going to test out some things I've
been working on," Kalvaria said.
The Cardinal was not divided between
the two tournaments according to any ul
terior motive. Rather, it was largely a
matter of personal preference.
"It's fairly random," Kalvaria said.

"Lele let the seniors choose where to go."
After this weekend, Stanford will have
to adjust its focus from the tournament
mentality it has been in all year. Dual
matches, played as a team against one
other team, offer a different challenge

have to learn to scrap it out and try

I lie (Cardinal has a lot ol tough
competition ahead of them this
school year, but it claims to be
well-prepared and well-condi
tioned for the five-month trek to
wards the NCAA championships
in May.
"We're in better shape than in

years past at the same time,"
Kalvaria said.
Returning five of last year's six
starters, the Cardinal hopes to re
tain its NCAA Championship for
another year, and this year has
proven promising, with many
players at hieving high singles and
doubles rankings.
"We have very high expecta
