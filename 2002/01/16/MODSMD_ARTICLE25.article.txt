### JIMMY WU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Coming off a less-t ban-satisfying sea
son, during which men's tennis was un
able to capture its INtli NCAA.national
team title in Georgia, this year's team
looks to start fresh with a squad that lost
three seniors.

MEN'S TENNIS
Friday-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford at
National Collegiate Tennis Classic,
Las Vegas

Now with Alex Kim, Ali Ansari and
Scotty Scott .ill graduated and current
ly on the professional tour, No. 2 Stan
ford will be led by top-ranked All-
American senior K. J. Hippensteel.
Hippensteel and his teammates will
be tested early in this weekend's Na
tional Collegiate Tennis Classic , being
held in Las Vegas.
According to head coach Dick Gould,
this tournament will be essential in de
termining the team's starting singles
and doubles lineups when the dual
meet season rolls around in a few weeks.

As the team prepares for its second
dual match against San Diego State on
Feb. 2, intrasquad matches and fall-sea
son play w ill also be considered when
announcing the lineup.
Scheduled to play singles in this
weekend's event will be Hippensteel,
juniors David Martin, Scott Lipskyand
Ryan Haviland, sophomore Joseph
Kao and freshmen Sam Warburg and
Phil Sheng.
Pairing up for doubles will be Hip
pensteel / Haviland, Martin / Lipsky
and Warburg / Sheng.
Hippensteel, however, may not trav
el with the team, because he has been
invited to play in a "Challenger" pro
event in Hawaii. According to Gould, if
Hippensteel decides to travel to
Hawaii, he would then put Kao in as
Haviland's doubles partner.
I his event will be the first time the
team will have played competitively
since the Cardinal captured a 5-2 vic to
ry over Hawaii last November.
"I think we are all really excited for
the chance to compete again," Havi
land said. "(College tennis in the fall can
get a little stale sometimes since there
are usually no team matches and only
one or two individual tournaments.
This tournament provides an excellent
chance lot the freshmen to showcase
their abilities as well as for the upper
classmen to increase their rankings and

compete for spots on the team."
The NCTC, arguably the strongest
Intercollegiate Tennis Association
sanctioned tournament of the season,
will feature men's players from several
teams ranked in the ITA l op 20.
Currently, Hippensteel is the only
player on the roster whose position is
not in question. He played No. 2 singles
behind Kim last year and will be a
strong contender for the NCAA singles
championship.
Could looks to his co-captain to
lead the team from his No. 1 singles
position.
Fighting for the next three spots will
be three of the four juniors on the team,
No. 43 Haviland, No. 49 co-captain
Martin and No. 31 Lipsky.
All three had solid seasons last year,
especially Haviland and Lipsky, whom

players from last year.

full health after suffering through a
case of mononucleosis and also a
bruised foot.
He will take a leave of absence fora

ailments.

MEN'S TENNIS
Friday-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford at
National Collegiate Tennis Classic,
Las Vegas

Now with Alex Kim, Ali Ansari and
Scotty Scott .ill graduated and current
ly on the professional tour, No. 2 Stan
ford will be led by top-ranked All-
American senior K. J. Hippensteel.
Hippensteel and his teammates will
be tested early in this weekend's Na
tional Collegiate Tennis Classic , being
held in Las Vegas.
According to head coach Dick Gould,
this tournament will be essential in de
termining the team's starting singles
and doubles lineups when the dual
meet season rolls around in a few weeks.

As the team prepares for its second
dual match against San Diego State on
Feb. 2, intrasquad matches and fall-sea
son play w ill also be considered when
announcing the lineup.
Scheduled to play singles in this
weekend's event will be Hippensteel,
juniors David Martin, Scott Lipskyand
Ryan Haviland, sophomore Joseph
Kao and freshmen Sam Warburg and
Phil Sheng.
Pairing up for doubles will be Hip
pensteel / Haviland, Martin / Lipsky
and Warburg / Sheng.
Hippensteel, however, may not trav
el with the team, because he has been
invited to play in a "Challenger" pro
event in Hawaii. According to Gould, if
Hippensteel decides to travel to
Hawaii, he would then put Kao in as
Haviland's doubles partner.
I his event will be the first time the
team will have played competitively
since the Cardinal captured a 5-2 vic to
ry over Hawaii last November.
"I think we are all really excited for
the chance to compete again," Havi
land said. "(College tennis in the fall can
get a little stale sometimes since there
are usually no team matches and only
one or two individual tournaments.
This tournament provides an excellent
chance lot the freshmen to showcase
their abilities as well as for the upper
classmen to increase their rankings and

compete for spots on the team."
The NCTC, arguably the strongest
Intercollegiate Tennis Association
sanctioned tournament of the season,
will feature men's players from several
teams ranked in the ITA l op 20.
Currently, Hippensteel is the only
player on the roster whose position is
not in question. He played No. 2 singles
behind Kim last year and will be a
strong contender for the NCAA singles
championship.
Could looks to his co-captain to
lead the team from his No. 1 singles
position.
Fighting for the next three spots will
be three of the four juniors on the team,
No. 43 Haviland, No. 49 co-captain
Martin and No. 31 Lipsky.
All three had solid seasons last year,
especially Haviland and Lipsky, whom
(iould believes to be the most improved
players from last year.
I he other junior on the team, Carter
Morris, will be counted on to anchor
die bottom of the lineup. Unfortunate
ly for the Cardinal, he is currently not in
full health after suffering through a
case of mononucleosis and also a
bruised foot.
He will take a leave of absence fora
quarter in order to recover from his
ailments.
With Morris out for the meantime,
Kao, Sheng, Warburg and senior Chris

Meyer will compete for the fifth and
sixth spots. Meyer returns to the team
after a year of studying overseas.
