# Baseball may play musical owners today
## Marlins, Expos and Red Sox owner's could arrange deal at meeting 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Baseball
owners headed to Phoenix yester
day fora historic meeting where
teams probably will approve sales
of the Boston Red Sox, Florida
Marlins and Montreal Expos.
The biggest deal calls fora
group led by John Henry, the
current Marlins' owner, to buy
the Red Sox from the Jean R.
Yawkey Trust for $660 million,
the highest price ever fora base
ball team.
Jeffrey Loria, the Expos'
owner, would buy the Marlins
from Henry for $158 million, and
the other 29 teams would buy back
the Expos' franchise from Loria
for $120 million, leaving the com
missioner's office to operate the
Montreal team — which is likely to
exist for one more season.
While the Red Sox have ac
knowledged the amount of their
deal, the prices for the sales of
Montreal and Florida were dis
closed by a baseball official who
spoke on the condition of

anonymity. All three deals could
he approved at today's opening
session of the two-day meeting.
"At this point we have every in
tention of proceeding," Bob
DuPuy, baseball's chief legal offi
cer, said Tuesday. "We haven't
been asked to do otherwise."
The Red Sox sale, which in
cludes Fenway Park and 80 per
cent of the New England Sports
Network, is controversial because
the team's current owners decided
to accept the offer from Henry
and spurn two higher bids: 5755
million from New York lawyer
Miles Prentice and $750 million
from Cablevision Systems Corp.
chairman Charles Dolan.
Massachusetts Attorney Gen
eral Thomas Reilly has interject
ed himself into the sale process,
saying his role is to make sure
charities benefitting from the
Yawkey Trust get the most
money they can.
Reilly has expressed concern
that baseball commissioner Bud
Selig and Red Sox chief executive
officer John Harrington led
Boston's limited partners to agree
to a deal with Henry's group,
which includes former San Diego
owner Tom Werner, former

Padres and Orioles president
Larry Lucchino and former Sen
ate Majority Leader George
Mitchell — all friends of Selig.
Prentice's offer would pay $495
million for the 53 percent control
ling share held by the Yawkey
Trust, and Dolan's would pay
$490 million. The Henry offer
would pay $410 million.
Selig denied accusations of fa
voritism, and Harrington said
Henry's deal had the best chance
to gain quick approval. Reilly con
tinued to negotiate with the Red
Sox on Tuesday.
"We're assessing our options,"
his spokeswoman, Ann I)onlan said.
Baseball has pushed forward
the Henry deal, agreed to on Dec.
20, at record speed. In most cases,
baseball takes six-to-12 months to
consider proposed sales.
The deals take place before the
backdrop of Selig's contraction
plan. Owners voted Nov. 0 to elim
inate two teams before the 2002
season but didn't pick which ones.
Montreal and Minnesota, two
teams that have been unable to get
government financing for new
ballparks, were the likely targets.
Hut a Minnesota judge issued an
injunction on Nov. 16 that forces

the Twins to honor their 2002
lease at the Metrodomc.
While the Twins and Selig ap
pealed — they're stilling awaiting
a decision — Alabama business
man Donald Watkins s.ml he want
to buy the Twins from current
owner Carl Polilad. All the threats
and uncertainty have led some
congressman to push fora repeal
of baseball's antitrust exemption.
Rep. John Conyers |r., the
ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee and Selig's
most vocal congressional oppo
nent. met Tuesday in New York
with management labor lawyer
Rob Manfred.
Conyers, who planned a
Wednesday news conference,
wants owners to release the players'
association from a confidentiality
agreement that prevents the union
from challenging in detail Selig's
claims that teams had a $232 mil
lion operating loss last year.
Conyers and Perry Apple
baum, the committee's minority
counsel, think they have an oral
understanding on releasing more
records. However, the deal must
be put into writing.
Loria, meanwhile, intends to
bring much of his Montreal stall
with him to Florida, in< hiding
manager Jell' l orborg. Loria also
wants tlu- Marlins to take over the
Kxpos' spring training fa<ilit\ in
Jupiter, Fla., and lor the Kxpos to
move to the Marlins" site in Mel
bom tie, Fla.
Selig intends to give owners
an update on his contraction
plan and on the collective bar
gaining proposal he made to the
union last week. It calls for a 50
percent luxun tax on the por
tions of pavrolls above $98 mil
lion and increasing the amount
of shared localh generated rev
enue, after dediulions from ball
park expenses, from 20 percent
per team to .">() percent.

the highest price ever fora base
ball team.
Jeffrey Loria, the Expos'
owner, would buy the Marlins
from Henry for $158 million, and
the other 29 teams would buy back
the Expos' franchise from Loria
for $120 million, leaving the com
missioner's office to operate the
Montreal team — which is likely to
exist for one more season.
While the Red Sox have ac
knowledged the amount of their
deal, the prices for the sales of
Montreal and Florida were dis
closed by a baseball official who
spoke on the condition of

anonymity. All three deals could
he approved at today's opening
session of the two-day meeting.
"At this point we have every in
tention of proceeding," Bob
DuPuy, baseball's chief legal offi
cer, said Tuesday. "We haven't
been asked to do otherwise."
The Red Sox sale, which in
cludes Fenway Park and 80 per
cent of the New England Sports
Network, is controversial because
the team's current owners decided
to accept the offer from Henry
and spurn two higher bids: 5755
million from New York lawyer
Miles Prentice and $750 million
from Cablevision Systems Corp.
chairman Charles Dolan.
Massachusetts Attorney Gen
eral Thomas Reilly has interject
ed himself into the sale process,
saying his role is to make sure
charities benefitting from the
Yawkey Trust get the most
money they can.
Reilly has expressed concern
that baseball commissioner Bud
Selig and Red Sox chief executive
officer John Harrington led
Boston's limited partners to agree
to a deal with Henry's group,
which includes former San Diego
owner Tom Werner, former

Padres and Orioles president
Larry Lucchino and former Sen
ate Majority Leader George
Mitchell — all friends of Selig.
Prentice's offer would pay $495
million for the 53 percent control
ling share held by the Yawkey
Trust, and Dolan's would pay
$490 million. The Henry offer
would pay $410 million.
Selig denied accusations of fa
voritism, and Harrington said
Henry's deal had the best chance
to gain quick approval. Reilly con
tinued to negotiate with the Red
Sox on Tuesday.
"We're assessing our options,"
his spokeswoman, Ann I)onlan said.
Baseball has pushed forward
the Henry deal, agreed to on Dec.
20, at record speed. In most cases,
baseball takes six-to-12 months to
consider proposed sales.
The deals take place before the
backdrop of Selig's contraction
plan. Owners voted Nov. 0 to elim
inate two teams before the 2002
season but didn't pick which ones.
Montreal and Minnesota, two
teams that have been unable to get
government financing for new
ballparks, were the likely targets.
Hut a Minnesota judge issued an
injunction on Nov. 16 that forces

the Twins to honor their 2002
lease at the Metrodomc.
While the Twins and Selig ap
pealed — they're stilling awaiting
a decision — Alabama business
man Donald Watkins s.ml he want
to buy the Twins from current
owner Carl Polilad. All the threats
and uncertainty have led some
congressman to push fora repeal
of baseball's antitrust exemption.
Rep. John Conyers |r., the
ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee and Selig's
most vocal congressional oppo
nent. met Tuesday in New York
with management labor lawyer
Rob Manfred.
Conyers, who planned a
Wednesday news conference,
wants owners to release the players'
association from a confidentiality
agreement that prevents the union
from challenging in detail Selig's
claims that teams had a $232 mil
lion operating loss last year.
Conyers and Perry Apple
baum, the committee's minority
counsel, think they have an oral
understanding on releasing more
records. However, the deal must
be put into writing.
Loria, meanwhile, intends to
bring much of his Montreal stall

Selig intends to give owners
an update on his contraction
plan and on the collective bar

union last week. It calls for a 50
