agreed to dedicate a stretch of land
running within 200 feet of San
Krancisquito Creek.
In order to keep the trail along
the edge of Stanford lands, but also
within Santa Clara County, the
trail needs to run along the creek,
"and that basically puts it on the
golf course," said Don Cheleme
dos, the Stanford Golf Course gen
eral manager.
The trail's effects on the golf
course have yet to be determined
for certain, but some are outraged
that the course could be affected.
"They should not be toying with
the golf course," I larrissaid. "fit] is
too important to the history, the cul

"Those people who have pro
posed that route that so blatantly vi
olates the golf course either have an
ulterior motive that they are not
sharing with people, or they are in
excusably insensitive to the Univer
sity's history and prominence," he
continued.
University officials disagree,
maintaining that the route along
Alpine Road is ac hievable and that,
even if the trail is constructed along
the golf course, it can be built in a
manner which would leave the
course unaffected.
"We think there are ways of lo
cating the trails so they don't ai
led the golf course," Provost

not going to destroy the golf
course, period."
Director of Government and
Community Relations Karry Hor

while understandable, are prema
ture. Stanford is in strong support
of putting the trail along Alpine
Road and we believe that this can be
clone. We do not want the trail
through the golf course."
The Stanford Golf Course, com

pleted in 1930, was the last course
designed by famed architect George
Thomas and is well-known
throughout the golfing world.
Last year, when part of the
course was endangered by a hous
ing proposal, professional golf stars
Tom Watson, Tiger Woods, Notah
Begay and Casey Martin wrote a let

tradition and beauty.
"It's such a traditional course

changed if the county decides to
widen Sand 1 fill Road, in which case
"a couple holes" would be need to
