-1 "lie raging debate between
Stanford, environmentalists, citi
zens and county officials regard
ing the location of two recreation
al trails on Stanford land is taking
on a new dimension, with yet an
other party entering the fray —
golf enthusiasts.
One of the possible alignments
for the C.-l hiking trail that runs
along the western edge of campus
could run through or interfere with
1 1 holes of the famed Stanford (k>lf
Course, according to Ric hard Har
ris. ( '.lass of'(is, spokesman li>i the
Committee to Save the Stanford
(>olf (lourse.
I he University is obligated to
dedicate the (1 trail along with the
S-1 trail off of I'age Mill Road in the
southeastern part of c ampu s under
the General Use Permit signed in
Dec ember 2000.
Under the Gl I', Stanford was

given tin- rights to develop approx
imately two million square feet of
academic buildings and 3,000
housing units over the next 10
years. ()tie of the stipulations of this
agreement was that the University
must dedicate and develop the (1-1
and S-1 trails.
Stanford and the surrounding
communities are currently debat
ing the exact alignments of these
two trails — a difficult process due
to vague wording in the GUP and
the environmental sensitivity of
the areas around the two pro
posed trails.
l he golf course controversy re
sults from difficulties in securing the
(1-1 trail. Ideally, University officials
would like to situate the trail along
Alpine Road, a safe distance from
the golf course, but this alignment
would pose several problems.
Among the difficulties, accord
ing to Harris, who captained the
I ( .)()K Stanford golf team, is that part
of the trail would run through pri

vate property and would partially
be contained in San Mateo County.
This would put the trail beyond the
jurisdiction of Santa Clara County,
with whom the GUl'was signed.
These two factors would make
approval of the (1-1 trail difficult, es
pecially with environmental groups
also arrayed against it.
"The route along Alpine Road is
not safe," said Den ice Dade of the
Committee for Green Foothills, a
local environmental group. "[lt isj
traffic-congested, not scenic and
would cross private property."
Due to the uncertainties involv
ing this proposed alignment,
many feel that it will be next to im
possible for Stanford to secure the
necessary land.
As a backup, Stanford has dedi
cated an alternate segment of land
runningentirelv within Santa (llara
County and University property. II
