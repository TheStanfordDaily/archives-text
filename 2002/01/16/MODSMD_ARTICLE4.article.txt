Editor's Note: This is the second arti

/acing East Palo Alto. Today, Iht
Daily loohs at allegations of police cor
ruption within the East Palo Alto Po
lice Department.

While some Stanford stu
dents celebrated this New Year
with fireworks and idle resolu-

tions, many Kast
Palo Alto resi
dents entered
the year with a
much more ag
gressive agenda:

ON
EAST
PALO ALTO

to expose and eliminate corrup
tion in the Kast Palo Alto police
department.
At the first city council meet
ing of 2002, hundreds of Kast
Palo Alto citizens rallied at the
town's Municipal Center to
protest alleged corruption and

misconduct within the city's po
lice department.
Re-hi red officer Cole seeks
active duty
I he primary goal of the pro
testers was to confront the city
counc il about its approach to a
controversial case involving police
Sgt. Robert (lole, who was recent
ly reinstated to the police depart
ment after being fired in 1999.
On Dec. 13, a federal judge or
dered the citv to re-hire C lole, hui

hy immediately
placing him on
"administrative
leave," the Police
Department has
all but ensured

that dole will stay of!"active duty
indefinitely.
(lole originally came to the Kast
Palo Alto force in 1986. In 1992,
Kast Palo Alto earned the title of
national "Murder Capital" for
having the highest per-capita mur
der rate in the country —12 mur
ders occurred in the town of about
24,000 that year, according to the
San Jose Mercury News.
In that same year, 270 rob
beries, 346 aggravated assaults
and 406 motor vehicle thefts oc
curred in the city, which lies just
two miles from Stanford, accord
ing to statistics compiled In Rand
California.
The town, which has less than
half the population ol Palo Alto, had
five limes as mam violent crimes re
ported that year.
Corrupt 'Wolf Pack* emerges
Over the next two years the
crime rate in l ast Palo Alto de
clined, as the Rand figures show.
But within the police force a new
group of officers emerged who en
gaged in illegal activities; they
dubbed themselves the "Wolf
Pack," according to (x»le.
"The 'Wolf Pack' was a group of
heavy-handed officers who assault
ed and burglarized, falsified police
reports and committed perjury."
Cole said.
"I told the officers who were
under my command 'No more."
When 1 went to my superiors, the ef
fort to push me out of the depart
ment began," he continued.
East Palo Alto resident Henry
Salas, who describes himself one
of Cole's "warrior supporters," s.iitl
the corruption in the Fast Palo Alto
Police Department is.harming the
community.
"This isn't right, this isn't jus
tice— especial!) in your own police
department."
Salas said that he would like to
see Cole restored to ac tive duty —
but that even attaining this goal
would signal only a partial victon
for Cole and his supporters, who
recognize that this case is only one
manifestation of the deep-seated
institutional corruption within the
department.
Since Cole began to uncover the
corruption in the f< >rc e, three officers
have served prison sentences for
misconduct.
"Rob Lucldon and Daniel Munoz
were arrested, convicted and did
time," Cole said. A third officer,
Shawn Wildinan, also served a
prison sentence, according to the
San Jose Mercury News.
Fora relatively small town, hast
Palo Alto has experienc ed unusually
high levels of public furor and nega
tive press over police misconduct —
and not only in response to the (ole
controversy.

Records of lieutenants questioned
in the past few years, the depart
ment has faced a number of other se
rious allegations of misconduct.
In JanuaiA 2000, rookie officer
Shawn W ildinan was charged In
San Mateo (ounty prosecutors with
sexual battery and abuse of authori
ty for allegedly molesting three
teenage girls in the back of a squad
car, according to (ole.
Accc>rding to both C< >le and an in
dependent report of the Human
Rights Defense Committee of San
|ose. there is a claim against the city
that Lt. Rod Norris — who at that
time was one of two second-ranking
officials in the department— and
Police ChiefWes Bowling attempted
to cover up Wildinan s misconduct.
According to the Mercury News,
when one claimant's mother called
Norris to file a complaint about
Wildinan, he laughed at her.
But San Mateo County Superior
Judge Mark R. Forcum wasn't
laughing when Wildinan's case
came before him.
Wildinan pleaded no contest to
thee barges and was sentenced to six
months in jail; Norris was promoted
to head the department's patrol divi
sion, ac cording to the San |ose Mer
cury News.
I lie Mercury News reported that
Norris himself has engaged in mis
conduct. I hat newspaper said that
four independent police sources
(laini that Norris "was forced to leave
the Richmond Police Department
for stealing evidence "
In at least one other case, the de
partment has promoted an officer
with a spotty record.
During the early 19905, Sgt.
I Ikniias Alipio was one of the lead
ers <>1 the "Wolf Pat k." Ile had
been fired from the( )akland Polite
Department for multiple counts of
brutality on c itizens, burglary and
falsifying payroll records, accord
ing to ('.ole.
"In court cases, Alipio has pled
the Fifth Amendment —which pro
tects defendants from having to an
swer incriminating questions—on
29 questions involving falsifying po
lite reports and unnecessary brutali
ty on (itizens." (ole said.
Since then, Alipio has been pro
moted to the rank of lieutenant,
and one of the roles of his job is in
vestigating citizens' complaints,
(ble continued.
Allegations include sex harass
ment, drug disposal
But Wildinan, who went to
prison for his sex offenses, is not the
only officer who has come under
fire for sexual misconduct. Several
former officers .of the Fast Palo Alto
polic edepai tnient allege that mem
bers of the department sexualh ha
rassed them.

In July of last year, Ibmier police
officer (lina (iarahaldi was awarded
a $185,000 settlement after allegedly
being unfairly fired from the depart
ment. (iarahaldi won the sexual ha
rassment suit she filed — but the city
will not re-hire her, Salas said.
The same is true in the case of for
mer officer Alma (kxldard, who, ac
cording to Salas, was also awarded a
settlement after bringing forth a sim
ilar claim. Ckxldard, like Garabaldi,
has not been reinstated to the police
department, Salas said.
But t raining Officer Terry
Brown, the officer Goddard filed a
claim against, was promoted to the
rank of acting sergeant, according to
the Mercury News.
And allegations of improper han
dling of controlled substances also
have emerged.
In November, former officer
Kenneth Cassettari filed a claim
against the city of Kast P;do Alto. Cas
settari was on duty with a field-train
ing officer last year when they dis
covered a gram of black tar heroin,
according to a claim Cassettari filed
against the c ity.
Instead of reporting the finding,
the officer instructed Cassettari to
dispose of the heroin in a nearby
dumpster. Cassettari recognized
that disposing of a controlled sub
stance is illegal and reported this in
< idem to Alipio, the claim reports.
"After I made the above reports I
received phone c alls from other offi
cers telling me to 'watch my hack," "
it continues.
B\ the end of last year Cassettari,
like- Cole and Garabaldi, was no
longer an employee of the East Palo
Alto Police 1 )epaitment; he was fired
In mail on May 18, his claim reports.
Police Chief Bowling called 'really

has led some citizens to call for his

"This isn't right, this isn't jus

department."
Salas said that he would like to
see Cole restored to ac tive duty —
but that even attaining this goal
would signal only a partial victon
for Cole and his supporters, who
recognize that this case is only one
manifestation of the deep-seated
institutional corruption within the
department.
Since Cole began to uncover the
corruption in the f< >rc e, three officers
have served prison sentences for
misconduct.
"Rob Lucldon and Daniel Munoz
were arrested, convicted and did
time," Cole said. A third officer,
Shawn Wildinan, also served a
prison sentence, according to the
San Jose Mercury News.
Fora relatively small town, hast
Palo Alto has experienc ed unusually
high levels of public furor and nega
tive press over police misconduct —
and not only in response to the (ole
controversy.

Records of lieutenants questioned
in the past few years, the depart
ment has faced a number of other se
rious allegations of misconduct.
In JanuaiA 2000, rookie officer
Shawn W ildinan was charged In
San Mateo (ounty prosecutors with
sexual battery and abuse of authori
ty for allegedly molesting three
teenage girls in the back of a squad
car, according to (ole.
Accc>rding to both C< >le and an in
dependent report of the Human
Rights Defense Committee of San
|ose. there is a claim against the city
that Lt. Rod Norris — who at that
time was one of two second-ranking
officials in the department— and
Police ChiefWes Bowling attempted
to cover up Wildinan s misconduct.
According to the Mercury News,
when one claimant's mother called
Norris to file a complaint about
Wildinan, he laughed at her.
But San Mateo County Superior
Judge Mark R. Forcum wasn't
laughing when Wildinan's case
came before him.
Wildinan pleaded no contest to
thee barges and was sentenced to six
months in jail; Norris was promoted
to head the department's patrol divi
sion, ac cording to the San |ose Mer
cury News.
I lie Mercury News reported that
Norris himself has engaged in mis
conduct. I hat newspaper said that
four independent police sources
(laini that Norris "was forced to leave
the Richmond Police Department
for stealing evidence "
In at least one other case, the de
partment has promoted an officer
with a spotty record.
During the early 19905, Sgt.
I Ikniias Alipio was one of the lead
ers <>1 the "Wolf Pat k." Ile had
been fired from the( )akland Polite
Department for multiple counts of
brutality on c itizens, burglary and
falsifying payroll records, accord
ing to ('.ole.
"In court cases, Alipio has pled
the Fifth Amendment —which pro
tects defendants from having to an
swer incriminating questions—on
29 questions involving falsifying po
lite reports and unnecessary brutali
ty on (itizens." (ole said.
Since then, Alipio has been pro
moted to the rank of lieutenant,
and one of the roles of his job is in
vestigating citizens' complaints,
(ble continued.
Allegations include sex harass
ment, drug disposal
But Wildinan, who went to
prison for his sex offenses, is not the
only officer who has come under
fire for sexual misconduct. Several
former officers .of the Fast Palo Alto
polic edepai tnient allege that mem
bers of the department sexualh ha
rassed them.

In July of last year, Ibmier police
officer (lina (iarahaldi was awarded
a $185,000 settlement after allegedly
being unfairly fired from the depart
ment. (iarahaldi won the sexual ha
rassment suit she filed — but the city
will not re-hire her, Salas said.
The same is true in the case of for
mer officer Alma (kxldard, who, ac
cording to Salas, was also awarded a
settlement after bringing forth a sim
ilar claim. Ckxldard, like Garabaldi,
has not been reinstated to the police
department, Salas said.
But t raining Officer Terry
Brown, the officer Goddard filed a
claim against, was promoted to the
rank of acting sergeant, according to
the Mercury News.
And allegations of improper han
dling of controlled substances also
have emerged.
In November, former officer
Kenneth Cassettari filed a claim
against the city of Kast P;do Alto. Cas
settari was on duty with a field-train
ing officer last year when they dis
covered a gram of black tar heroin,
according to a claim Cassettari filed
against the c ity.
Instead of reporting the finding,
the officer instructed Cassettari to
dispose of the heroin in a nearby
dumpster. Cassettari recognized
that disposing of a controlled sub
stance is illegal and reported this in
< idem to Alipio, the claim reports.
"After I made the above reports I
received phone c alls from other offi
cers telling me to 'watch my hack," "
it continues.
B\ the end of last year Cassettari,
like- Cole and Garabaldi, was no
longer an employee of the East Palo
Alto Police 1 )epaitment; he was fired
In mail on May 18, his claim reports.

Editor's Note: This is the second arti

Daily loohs at allegations of police cor

While some Stanford stu

with fireworks and idle resolu-

tions, many Kast
Palo Alto resi
dents entered
the year with a
much more ag
gressive agenda:

ON
EAST
PALO ALTO

to expose and eliminate corrup
tion in the Kast Palo Alto police
department.
At the first city council meet
ing of 2002, hundreds of Kast
Palo Alto citizens rallied at the
town's Municipal Center to
protest alleged corruption and

misconduct within the city's po
lice department.
Re-hi red officer Cole seeks
active duty
I he primary goal of the pro
testers was to confront the city
counc il about its approach to a
controversial case involving police
Sgt. Robert (lole, who was recent
ly reinstated to the police depart
ment after being fired in 1999.
On Dec. 13, a federal judge or
dered the citv to re-hire C lole, hui

hy immediately
placing him on
"administrative
leave," the Police
Department has
all but ensured

that dole will stay of!"active duty
indefinitely.
(lole originally came to the Kast
Palo Alto force in 1986. In 1992,
Kast Palo Alto earned the title of
national "Murder Capital" for
having the highest per-capita mur
der rate in the country —12 mur
ders occurred in the town of about
24,000 that year, according to the
San Jose Mercury News.
In that same year, 270 rob
beries, 346 aggravated assaults
and 406 motor vehicle thefts oc
curred in the city, which lies just
two miles from Stanford, accord
ing to statistics compiled In Rand
California.
The town, which has less than
half the population ol Palo Alto, had
five limes as mam violent crimes re
ported that year.
Corrupt 'Wolf Pack* emerges
Over the next two years the
crime rate in l ast Palo Alto de
clined, as the Rand figures show.
But within the police force a new
group of officers emerged who en
gaged in illegal activities; they
dubbed themselves the "Wolf
Pack," according to (x»le.
"The 'Wolf Pack' was a group of
heavy-handed officers who assault
ed and burglarized, falsified police
reports and committed perjury."
Cole said.
"I told the officers who were
under my command 'No more."
When 1 went to my superiors, the ef
fort to push me out of the depart
ment began," he continued.
East Palo Alto resident Henry
Salas, who describes himself one
of Cole's "warrior supporters," s.iitl
the corruption in the Fast Palo Alto
Police Department is.harming the
community.
"This isn't right, this isn't jus

and one of the roles of his job is in
vestigating citizens' complaints,

Allegations include sex harass
ment, drug disposal
But Wildinan, who went to
prison for his sex offenses, is not the
only officer who has come under
fire for sexual misconduct. Several
former officers .of the Fast Palo Alto
polic edepai tnient allege that mem
bers of the department sexualh ha
rassed them.

In July of last year, Ibmier police
officer (lina (iarahaldi was awarded
a $185,000 settlement after allegedly
being unfairly fired from the depart
ment. (iarahaldi won the sexual ha
rassment suit she filed — but the city
will not re-hire her, Salas said.
The same is true in the case of for
mer officer Alma (kxldard, who, ac
cording to Salas, was also awarded a
settlement after bringing forth a sim
ilar claim. Ckxldard, like Garabaldi,
has not been reinstated to the police
department, Salas said.
But t raining Officer Terry
Brown, the officer Goddard filed a
claim against, was promoted to the
rank of acting sergeant, according to
the Mercury News.
And allegations of improper han
dling of controlled substances also
have emerged.
In November, former officer
Kenneth Cassettari filed a claim
against the city of Kast P;do Alto. Cas
settari was on duty with a field-train
ing officer last year when they dis
covered a gram of black tar heroin,
according to a claim Cassettari filed
against the c ity.
Instead of reporting the finding,
the officer instructed Cassettari to
dispose of the heroin in a nearby
dumpster. Cassettari recognized
that disposing of a controlled sub
stance is illegal and reported this in
< idem to Alipio, the claim reports.
"After I made the above reports I
received phone c alls from other offi
cers telling me to 'watch my hack," "

Police cruisers are not always a symbol of security and justice for residents of East Palo Alto. The city's police de
partment has come under fire as allegations of corruption haunt its credibility.
Editor's Note: This is the second arti
cle in a weekly series examining issues
/acing East Palo Alto. Today, Iht
Daily loohs at allegations of police cor
ruption within the East Palo Alto Po
lice Department.

While some Stanford stu
dents celebrated this New Year
with fireworks and idle resolu-

tions, many Kast
Palo Alto resi
dents entered
the year with a
much more ag
gressive agenda:

ON
EAST
PALO ALTO

to expose and eliminate corrup
tion in the Kast Palo Alto police
department.
At the first city council meet
ing of 2002, hundreds of Kast
Palo Alto citizens rallied at the
town's Municipal Center to
protest alleged corruption and

misconduct within the city's po
lice department.
Re-hi red officer Cole seeks
active duty
I he primary goal of the pro
testers was to confront the city
counc il about its approach to a
controversial case involving police
Sgt. Robert (lole, who was recent
ly reinstated to the police depart
ment after being fired in 1999.
On Dec. 13, a federal judge or
dered the citv to re-hire C lole, hui

hy immediately
placing him on
"administrative
leave," the Police
Department has
all but ensured

that dole will stay of!"active duty
indefinitely.
(lole originally came to the Kast
Palo Alto force in 1986. In 1992,
Kast Palo Alto earned the title of
national "Murder Capital" for
having the highest per-capita mur
der rate in the country —12 mur
ders occurred in the town of about
24,000 that year, according to the
San Jose Mercury News.
In that same year, 270 rob
beries, 346 aggravated assaults
and 406 motor vehicle thefts oc
curred in the city, which lies just
two miles from Stanford, accord
ing to statistics compiled In Rand
California.
The town, which has less than
half the population ol Palo Alto, had
five limes as mam violent crimes re
ported that year.
Corrupt 'Wolf Pack* emerges
Over the next two years the
crime rate in l ast Palo Alto de
clined, as the Rand figures show.
But within the police force a new
group of officers emerged who en
gaged in illegal activities; they
dubbed themselves the "Wolf
Pack," according to (x»le.
"The 'Wolf Pack' was a group of
heavy-handed officers who assault
ed and burglarized, falsified police
reports and committed perjury."
Cole said.
"I told the officers who were
under my command 'No more."
When 1 went to my superiors, the ef
fort to push me out of the depart
ment began," he continued.
East Palo Alto resident Henry
Salas, who describes himself one
of Cole's "warrior supporters," s.iitl
the corruption in the Fast Palo Alto
Police Department is.harming the
community.
"This isn't right, this isn't jus
tice— especial!) in your own police
department."
Salas said that he would like to
see Cole restored to ac tive duty —
but that even attaining this goal
would signal only a partial victon
for Cole and his supporters, who
recognize that this case is only one
manifestation of the deep-seated
institutional corruption within the
department.
Since Cole began to uncover the
corruption in the f< >rc e, three officers
have served prison sentences for
misconduct.
"Rob Lucldon and Daniel Munoz
were arrested, convicted and did
time," Cole said. A third officer,
Shawn Wildinan, also served a
prison sentence, according to the
San Jose Mercury News.
Fora relatively small town, hast
Palo Alto has experienc ed unusually
high levels of public furor and nega
tive press over police misconduct —
and not only in response to the (ole
controversy.

Records of lieutenants questioned
in the past few years, the depart
ment has faced a number of other se
rious allegations of misconduct.
In JanuaiA 2000, rookie officer
Shawn W ildinan was charged In
San Mateo (ounty prosecutors with
sexual battery and abuse of authori
ty for allegedly molesting three
teenage girls in the back of a squad
car, according to (ole.
Accc>rding to both C< >le and an in
dependent report of the Human
Rights Defense Committee of San
|ose. there is a claim against the city
that Lt. Rod Norris — who at that
time was one of two second-ranking
officials in the department— and
Police ChiefWes Bowling attempted
to cover up Wildinan s misconduct.
According to the Mercury News,
when one claimant's mother called
Norris to file a complaint about
Wildinan, he laughed at her.
But San Mateo County Superior
Judge Mark R. Forcum wasn't
laughing when Wildinan's case
came before him.
Wildinan pleaded no contest to
thee barges and was sentenced to six
months in jail; Norris was promoted
to head the department's patrol divi
sion, ac cording to the San |ose Mer
cury News.
I lie Mercury News reported that
Norris himself has engaged in mis
conduct. I hat newspaper said that
four independent police sources
(laini that Norris "was forced to leave
the Richmond Police Department
for stealing evidence "
In at least one other case, the de
partment has promoted an officer
with a spotty record.
During the early 19905, Sgt.
I Ikniias Alipio was one of the lead
ers <>1 the "Wolf Pat k." Ile had
been fired from the( )akland Polite
Department for multiple counts of
brutality on c itizens, burglary and
falsifying payroll records, accord
ing to ('.ole.
"In court cases, Alipio has pled
the Fifth Amendment —which pro
tects defendants from having to an
swer incriminating questions—on
29 questions involving falsifying po
lite reports and unnecessary brutali
ty on (itizens." (ole said.
Since then, Alipio has been pro
moted to the rank of lieutenant,
and one of the roles of his job is in
vestigating citizens' complaints,
