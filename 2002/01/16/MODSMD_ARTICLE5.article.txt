# Greek discipline 'an educational process'
## Judicial board gives students a major role in reviewing the conduct of Greek organizations 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Ten years ago, Stanford's Greek Judicial
Board was founded upon the idea of "peer re
view" in dealing with disciplinary issues within
the Greek community. I'oday, the J uc li< i<il
Board lias evolved into an efli< ient, two-panel
source of review in the community that aims to
educate fraternities and sororities and better
incorporate them into the larger Stanford
community.
The board consists of two identical panels.
Each panel is made up of nine members, in
cluding two each from the Inter-Fraternity
Council, the Inter-Sorority Council and the
African Americ an Fraternal and Sororal Associ
ation, as well as three non-Greek students c ho
sen by the ASSU.
Stanford takes unique approach
The process of the |udicial Board spans
across many levels â€” from students all the way
to the Office of the Dean of Students. Its scope
encompasses decisions and opinions of author
ities, administrators, and students in both the

(ireek community and Stanford at large.
Members of I lie board say that what makes
the panel special is its concept of allowing non
administrators to have a say in final dec isionson
('.reek disciplinary issues.
"It's primarily an educational process," said
Nanci I lowe, assistant dean of students and di
rector of student activities. "I think there are a
fail number of universities that handle (Greek
issues 1 on a more administrative level. What we
seek to do is to identify ways to correct the prob
lem and strengthen the chapters."
Allegations prompt board review
Morris Graves, associate dean of students in
charge of the Office of Student Affairs, is the
only staff member on the Judicial Board.
"The Greek Judic ial Board convenes when
there is an issue that comes up involving Stan
ford Greeks," Graves said. "It is charged with a
review of allegations of misconduct, I niversity
policy violations, and/or alcohol-related inci
dences that violate state regulations and ques
tionable behavior as it pertains to Greek orga
nizations on campus."

Such allegations are most commonly
brought to the board via a University adminis
trator, a student, a poli< e report or from the Of
fice ol Student Activities.
If the allegations are against a fraternity,
Howe, who serves as the advisor of campus
sororities, makes the investigation; if the
charges are against a sorority, the investigation
is conducted by Asst. Director of Student Activ
ities Joey Greenwell, the fraternity advisor. The
investigations are done in this way to allow the
respective advisors to continue serving in their
roles without a conflict of interest.
"Upon the end of the investigation, [Howe
or Greenwell | decides whether or not it should
go before the Judicial Board," Graves said. "If
so, the Board convenes and determines
whether or not a full investigation is warranted.
Board solicits Greek input
"In the meantime, the fraternity or sorority
under investigation meets with its adviser
(Howe or Grecnwell) and drafts a 'self-study,'
or a response to the allegations," Graves ton
tinned. "The Board recognizes this as written
documentation from the organization.
"We'll call in the leadership [of the Greek or-
involved] to discuss what we've
heard, and hear the chapter's feedback. Ru
mors flow, but we want to talk about what we've
heard. If it's a fraternitv, I'm acting as its sup-
