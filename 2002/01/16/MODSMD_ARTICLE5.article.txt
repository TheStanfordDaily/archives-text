# Greek discipline 'an educational process'
## Judicial board gives students a major role in reviewing the conduct of Greek organizations 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Ten years ago, Stanford's Greek Judicial
Board was founded upon the idea of "peer re
view" in dealing with disciplinary issues within
the Greek community. I'oday, the J uc li< i<il
Board lias evolved into an efli< ient, two-panel
source of review in the community that aims to
educate fraternities and sororities and better
incorporate them into the larger Stanford
community.
The board consists of two identical panels.
Each panel is made up of nine members, in
cluding two each from the Inter-Fraternity
Council, the Inter-Sorority Council and the
African Americ an Fraternal and Sororal Associ
ation, as well as three non-Greek students c ho
sen by the ASSU.
Stanford takes unique approach
The process of the |udicial Board spans
across many levels — from students all the way
to the Office of the Dean of Students. Its scope
encompasses decisions and opinions of author
ities, administrators, and students in both the

(ireek community and Stanford at large.
Members of I lie board say that what makes
the panel special is its concept of allowing non
administrators to have a say in final dec isionson
('.reek disciplinary issues.
"It's primarily an educational process," said
Nanci I lowe, assistant dean of students and di
rector of student activities. "I think there are a
fail number of universities that handle (Greek
issues 1 on a more administrative level. What we
seek to do is to identify ways to correct the prob
lem and strengthen the chapters."
Allegations prompt board review
Morris Graves, associate dean of students in
charge of the Office of Student Affairs, is the
only staff member on the Judicial Board.
"The Greek Judic ial Board convenes when
there is an issue that comes up involving Stan
ford Greeks," Graves said. "It is charged with a
review of allegations of misconduct, I niversity
policy violations, and/or alcohol-related inci
dences that violate state regulations and ques
tionable behavior as it pertains to Greek orga
nizations on campus."

Such allegations are most commonly
brought to the board via a University adminis
trator, a student, a poli< e report or from the Of
fice ol Student Activities.
If the allegations are against a fraternity,
Howe, who serves as the advisor of campus
sororities, makes the investigation; if the
charges are against a sorority, the investigation
is conducted by Asst. Director of Student Activ
ities Joey Greenwell, the fraternity advisor. The
investigations are done in this way to allow the
respective advisors to continue serving in their
roles without a conflict of interest.
"Upon the end of the investigation, [Howe
or Greenwell | decides whether or not it should
go before the Judicial Board," Graves said. "If
so, the Board convenes and determines
whether or not a full investigation is warranted.
Board solicits Greek input
"In the meantime, the fraternity or sorority
under investigation meets with its adviser
(Howe or Grecnwell) and drafts a 'self-study,'
or a response to the allegations," Graves ton
tinned. "The Board recognizes this as written
documentation from the organization.
"We'll call in the leadership [of the Greek or-
involved] to discuss what we've
heard, and hear the chapter's feedback. Ru
mors flow, but we want to talk about what we've
heard. If it's a fraternitv, I'm acting as its sup-

port and adviser.
"The board then calls in mem
bers it wants to hear from, and
after the hearings, deliberates,"
Graves said. " The first part is Jo
identify the facts of the case. I he
second part is to review the Mem
orandum of Record and answer
questions it raises."
Wais reviews board sanctions
Graves explained that after the
lx>ard renders decisions on those
answers, it determines the sanc
tions to be imposed. It is at this
point that the notion of peer re
view and the education process
comes to life.
"Our priority is to ask ourselves
'What kinds of sanctions can we
impose to get the group to
learn?'" Graves said.
Howe listed a number of possi
ble sanctions, such as "community

service, having the organization
take part in Greek leadership re
treats [or] party workshops."
Sanctions can also be punitive in
nature. For example, during the
1908-09 school year, the I'lii Delta
I 'beta 112 raternity lost its house at
(WO I .omita and had its charter re
voked by the University for five
years.
After making these decisions,
the board selects one member to
draft its official response for Dean
of Students Mate Wais, who con
sults with Graves, Howe and
Greenwell to ensure that the dec i
sion follows past precedent.
."There are three choices that
[Wais| can make on that deci
sion," ( »raves said. "I le < an either
accept it, reject it or amend it. In
the latter two cases, he meets first
with the members of the board to
explain to them why he is making
that dec ision."
After that, Wais writes a letter to
notify the fraternity or sorority
president, regional advisors and
the organizations' national leaders.

Process deemed rigid but
educational
"The Judicial Board is still an
evolutionary process," Graves
said. "Many rules were established
just two years ago. Perhaps next
year, we'll add a faculty and or stall
member just like the regular Judi
cial Board under the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs."
Howe said that while the
process is rigid, ii is "also a really
good experience for those stu
dents on the board."
Stanford alumnus Adam
Gopin, a member of the board in
1994-9"), agreed.
" I lie Greek JtKlicial Board was
one of the most interesting experi
ences that I had at Stanford," he
said. "With so much classroom
work being purely theoretical, the
practical lessons learned were in
valuable. We had interaction with
student leaders, University admin
istrators and others that I never
would have had contact with.
"Working with a group and de

ciding how to approach sensitive
issues while coming to fair and just
resolutions was not an easy task,"
Gopin added.
'We had to walk a fine line'
I he Greek Judicial Board's
current co-chair, senior Lisa
Walther-Meade, a member of Pi
Beta Phi, said she feels that her
participation has given her a voice
to help and educate the (ireek sys
tem at Stanford.
"My major goal is that all the
fraternities and sororities thrive
here and contribute positively to
the greater community," she
said. "For example, drinking
happens in freshman dorms, but
when you're (ireek, you are held
under a microscope. We're the
only group that self-selects and
because of that, the University
holds us to a higher standard.
This is good because it entour
ages the Greek community to be
a good example."
Junior Steph Cheung, a mem
ber of the Delta Delta Delta sorori

ty and co-chair of the Judicial
Board said, "1 think it is very im
portant that the University has
designated a group of students to
make recommendations regard
ing violations of University policy
within the Greek community.
"The system holds Greek orga
nizations more accountable to
their peers for their actions," she
continued.
Gopin said the board's duties
are sensitive. "We had to walk a
fine line on the Greek Judicial
Board," he said. "We wanted the
student body to take us seriously,
and we strove to not be just a rub
ber stamp committee for the
Dean's Office.
"Oftentimes, we would try to
work with the student groups that
were brought before us to see if
they could propose reasonable so
lutions or sanctions," he added.
"We tried to impart to them a
sense of responsibility for their ac
tions in hopes that they would
truly learn from their mistakes and
not repeat them."

Ten years ago, Stanford's Greek Judicial
Board was founded upon the idea of "peer re
view" in dealing with disciplinary issues within
the Greek community. I'oday, the J uc li< i<il
Board lias evolved into an efli< ient, two-panel
source of review in the community that aims to
educate fraternities and sororities and better
incorporate them into the larger Stanford
community.
The board consists of two identical panels.
Each panel is made up of nine members, in
cluding two each from the Inter-Fraternity
Council, the Inter-Sorority Council and the
African Americ an Fraternal and Sororal Associ
ation, as well as three non-Greek students c ho
sen by the ASSU.
Stanford takes unique approach
The process of the |udicial Board spans
across many levels — from students all the way
to the Office of the Dean of Students. Its scope
encompasses decisions and opinions of author
ities, administrators, and students in both the

(ireek community and Stanford at large.
Members of I lie board say that what makes
the panel special is its concept of allowing non
administrators to have a say in final dec isionson
('.reek disciplinary issues.
"It's primarily an educational process," said
Nanci I lowe, assistant dean of students and di
rector of student activities. "I think there are a
fail number of universities that handle (Greek
issues 1 on a more administrative level. What we
seek to do is to identify ways to correct the prob
lem and strengthen the chapters."
Allegations prompt board review
Morris Graves, associate dean of students in
charge of the Office of Student Affairs, is the
only staff member on the Judicial Board.
"The Greek Judic ial Board convenes when
there is an issue that comes up involving Stan
ford Greeks," Graves said. "It is charged with a
review of allegations of misconduct, I niversity
policy violations, and/or alcohol-related inci
dences that violate state regulations and ques
tionable behavior as it pertains to Greek orga
nizations on campus."

Such allegations are most commonly
brought to the board via a University adminis
trator, a student, a poli< e report or from the Of
fice ol Student Activities.
If the allegations are against a fraternity,
Howe, who serves as the advisor of campus
sororities, makes the investigation; if the
charges are against a sorority, the investigation
is conducted by Asst. Director of Student Activ
ities Joey Greenwell, the fraternity advisor. The
investigations are done in this way to allow the
respective advisors to continue serving in their
roles without a conflict of interest.
"Upon the end of the investigation, [Howe
or Greenwell | decides whether or not it should
go before the Judicial Board," Graves said. "If
so, the Board convenes and determines
whether or not a full investigation is warranted.
Board solicits Greek input
"In the meantime, the fraternity or sorority
under investigation meets with its adviser
(Howe or Grecnwell) and drafts a 'self-study,'
or a response to the allegations," Graves ton
tinned. "The Board recognizes this as written
documentation from the organization.
"We'll call in the leadership [of the Greek or-
involved] to discuss what we've
heard, and hear the chapter's feedback. Ru
mors flow, but we want to talk about what we've
heard. If it's a fraternitv, I'm acting as its sup-

port and adviser.
"The board then calls in mem
bers it wants to hear from, and
after the hearings, deliberates,"
Graves said. " The first part is Jo
identify the facts of the case. I he
second part is to review the Mem
orandum of Record and answer
questions it raises."
Wais reviews board sanctions
Graves explained that after the
lx>ard renders decisions on those
answers, it determines the sanc
tions to be imposed. It is at this
point that the notion of peer re
view and the education process
comes to life.
"Our priority is to ask ourselves
'What kinds of sanctions can we
impose to get the group to
learn?'" Graves said.
Howe listed a number of possi
ble sanctions, such as "community

service, having the organization
take part in Greek leadership re
treats [or] party workshops."
Sanctions can also be punitive in
nature. For example, during the
1908-09 school year, the I'lii Delta
I 'beta 112 raternity lost its house at
(WO I .omita and had its charter re
voked by the University for five
years.
After making these decisions,
the board selects one member to
draft its official response for Dean
of Students Mate Wais, who con
sults with Graves, Howe and
Greenwell to ensure that the dec i
sion follows past precedent.
."There are three choices that
[Wais| can make on that deci
sion," ( »raves said. "I le < an either
accept it, reject it or amend it. In
the latter two cases, he meets first
with the members of the board to
explain to them why he is making
that dec ision."
After that, Wais writes a letter to
notify the fraternity or sorority
president, regional advisors and
the organizations' national leaders.

Process deemed rigid but
educational
"The Judicial Board is still an
evolutionary process," Graves
said. "Many rules were established
just two years ago. Perhaps next
year, we'll add a faculty and or stall
member just like the regular Judi
cial Board under the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs."
Howe said that while the
process is rigid, ii is "also a really
good experience for those stu
dents on the board."
Stanford alumnus Adam
Gopin, a member of the board in
1994-9"), agreed.
" I lie Greek JtKlicial Board was
one of the most interesting experi
ences that I had at Stanford," he
said. "With so much classroom
work being purely theoretical, the
practical lessons learned were in
valuable. We had interaction with
student leaders, University admin
istrators and others that I never
would have had contact with.
"Working with a group and de

ciding how to approach sensitive
issues while coming to fair and just
resolutions was not an easy task,"
Gopin added.
'We had to walk a fine line'
I he Greek Judicial Board's
current co-chair, senior Lisa
Walther-Meade, a member of Pi
Beta Phi, said she feels that her
participation has given her a voice
to help and educate the (ireek sys
tem at Stanford.
"My major goal is that all the
fraternities and sororities thrive
here and contribute positively to
the greater community," she
said. "For example, drinking
happens in freshman dorms, but
when you're (ireek, you are held
under a microscope. We're the
only group that self-selects and
because of that, the University
holds us to a higher standard.
This is good because it entour
ages the Greek community to be
a good example."
Junior Steph Cheung, a mem
ber of the Delta Delta Delta sorori

ty and co-chair of the Judicial
Board said, "1 think it is very im
portant that the University has
designated a group of students to
make recommendations regard
ing violations of University policy
within the Greek community.
"The system holds Greek orga
nizations more accountable to
their peers for their actions," she
continued.
Gopin said the board's duties
are sensitive. "We had to walk a
fine line on the Greek Judicial
Board," he said. "We wanted the
student body to take us seriously,
and we strove to not be just a rub
