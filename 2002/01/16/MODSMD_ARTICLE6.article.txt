# Stadium renovation not in the cards

Despite reports of dissatisfac
tion with Stanford Stadium, the
venerable home of Cardinal foot
ball, a large-si ale renovation of the
facility is apparently not on the
University's agenda.
"I don't expect us to make any
changes in the foreseeable future,"
Provost John Ktchemendy said.
"Most people agree that we'd be
better off with a smaller stadium,
and a lot of things could be
changed. However, on the list of
priorities for the University, it is
not at the top."
Etchemendy cited graduate
student housing as taking priori
ty over changing or renovating
the stadium.
"A lot of people believe it's an
old-style stadium with a shallow
rake and a large capacity," he said.
"People at the top are far away
from the field, and it's extremely
rare that we need to have the stadi
um filled to its full capacity.
The stadium, built in 1921,
seats 85,500 fans. It has hosted
both men's and women's World

(kip Soccer, Olympic events and
Super Bowl XIX.
While Stanford has gained
worldwide exposure for the big
ticket events it has hosted at the
stadium, such occasions are infre
quent.
Some of the most pressing
problems for the stadium include
wheelchair access and bathroom
and concession-area space. While
the shallow slope of the stadium
would be difficult to change, the
track around the football field
could be removed, bringing spec
tators closer to the action.
Kootball players agreed that the
extra distance due to the track was
their main concern.
" The fans arep't as involved as
we'd like them to be," said sopho
more offensive lineman Kirk
(lumbers. "When the fans are
pulled away from the game it isn't
as exciting."
Chambers pointed to the stadi
ums at Washington and ()regon as
places where fans filled the stands
and were close to the ac tion.
"You always want to play in
front of sold-out crowds," he said.

Other players did not find the
stadium issue too concerning.
"Once I start play ing, I foc us
on the game," said senior Simba
Hoclari. "When I get on the field,
the size of the stadium doesn't re
ally matter."
Freshman Capp Culver said,
"While the stadium is too big for
us, it's home tight now, and there's
a lot of tradition with the stadium,
especially with Big (lame."
Asst. Athletic Director Gary
Migdol affirmed that the stadium
needs a retrofit. "It's fair to say
that Stanford Stadium is one of
the oldest stadiums in the country
and that there is work to be
clone," he said.
Still, Migclol noted that some
renovations take place every year.
" I here has been a great invest
ment made in the Stanford stadi
um every year, albeit some
changes are difficult for fans to
see," he said.
"Fhe Athletic Department is
looking at feasibility studies and all
sorts of options are being studied."

From its cold impersonality to its onnoyirigly sloped field, critics have leveled many complaints at the 85,500-capac
ity behemoth that is Stanford Stadium. Yet the University maintains that its renovation is not high on the priority list.
Migdol added. "It is the athletic
department's desire to make all
Stanford athletic facilities among
the best in the nation."
One circumstance under
which the stadium might be reno
vated is if the Bay Area succeeds in
its bid to host the 2012 Olympic
Summer Games. If the Bay Area is
awarded the Games, several
events — including the Opening
and Glosing Ceremonies — will
be held at the Stanford Stadium.
"We've indicated a willingness
to let the Bay Area Sports Orga
nizing Committee use some of
our facilities as a community ser
vice," Ktchemendy said. "If the
community wanted it here, we'd
help out."
If the area's bid is successful,
BASOC will fund and carry out
the stadium's renovations,
Etchemendy said.
