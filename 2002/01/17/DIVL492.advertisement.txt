In what has been callcd by Gary Snyder
"Fresh as a bucket of cold water",
Jim Heynen has written 64 sharply
honed stories from over 20-years
of his work, which showcase his mastery
of terse, elegant prose and old-style
country wit and wisdom. Every tale is
an unerring slice from the lives of a group
of farm boys, each full of mischief and
witness to the world's tiny miracles.
This retrospective volume serves as a
companion to his much-praised collection,
Ihe One-Room Schoolhouse. Heynen
has been Writer in Residence at St. Olaf
College in Northfield, MN since 1992
and has been called, "a Hemingway
of farm life", by the Kirkus Review.
