## 
### KATIE TAYLOR 
Residents of the Fresh
man/Sophomore College will
begin a series of week-long siu
dent-led seminars next week.
Eight sophomores, with the
help of faculty and experts in
their subjects of interest, will
hold seminars this quarter, and
an additional eight will do so in
the spring.
All the seminars are open to
12 freshman and sophomore
residents of FroSoC 10.
According to the Sophomore
Fellows program Web site, the
program "is truly a hands-on op
portunity for all involved; il al
lows for participants to meet with
professors and experts, discuss
ideas and become engaged in a
field that excites them in a non
traditional educational setting.'"
Cheng Wang, a sophomore
fellow who will lead a seminar ti
tled "Problem Solving with Ro
botics," said that with his project
lie "wanted to offer an experi
ence in a 'techie' disc ipline that
did not involve massive amount
of physics and math and all this
hard stuff."
"I wanted to jump to the in
teresting stuff . . . so I'm doing
Robotics with Legos," lie said.
Wang said he believes the
Sophomore Fellows program
was integral in making his sem
inar a possibility.
"Usually this kind of project
would be prohibitivel) expen
sive— 1 just spent over $500
on Legos — but under the
[program's] umbrella, it put
fun stuff like this within reach,"
he said.
Participating FroSoCo resi
dents, who had to undergo an
application process for the op
oortunitv. are assigned to semi

nars by a lottery system. A stu
dent may participate in more
than one seminar if space is
available.
Each of the projects aims to
include discussion with an ex
pert in the field, as well as
hands-on experience in the
area of study such as a field trip
or project, according to the
Web sile.
" l he largest challenge is fit
ting all the things you want to
teach others into one coherent
project with a clear goal," said
sophomore Jennifer McDon
ald, who will be leading a semi
nar called "Seeing the Street."
" The other things done so
far are much simpler, especially
due to the support of the fat ui
ty sponsor and the awesome
FroSoClo staff ," she continued.
Fhe application for the semi
nar leaders required them to
outline the basic subject matter
for their (lass and how they
planned to investigate their
subject of interest. I hey were
also required to propose a bud
get for their project.
One of the FroSoC o College
Assistants, senior Andres Small,
who was in < barge of reading
seminar applications, said,
"More than anything, we want
to expose our sophomores to
the experience of submitting a
grant proposal to the [Under
graduate Research Opportuni
ties ofFice] or for any of the fel
lowships that are offered at
Stanford later on."
Other seminar topics being
offered this quarter include
"American Buddhism," "('.los
ing the Digital Divide," "Ameri
ca: Money Versus Morality,"
"Oral Drug Delivery,"
"Fast / West Healing" and
