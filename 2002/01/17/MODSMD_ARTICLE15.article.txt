One-Acts yesterday night at the

show features two student-written
plays and a performance bv Scenic
Root, a Stanford comedy troupe spe
cializing in long-form improvisation.
"Foam," written by junior Anne
Gregory and directed by sophomore
Marika Knowles, is about a woman,
Jan, who has lost herself and is strug
gling to regain her sanity.
Set in New York City, the play ad
dresses the lifestyle that comes with
being young and single there and
deals with the sometimes negative
ways in which New York can make
people hyperconscious about their
own image.
"She's neurotic, which makes fora
very funny play," Knowles said. "But
it's also an honest look at how women
can distort their self-perceptions.
I lopefully, the audience will be able to
identify with (an and her self-doubt."

where she converses with her hard
edged New-York fairy godmother
Kristen.
l he second play, "Class," writ
ten by Andrew Leeds, Class of
2001, and junior Rebecca White
hurst and directed bv sophomore
Ed Iskandar, deals with the rela
tionship between a teat her and a
student in a school. The play that
will be performed is slightly differ
ent from the script th.it was submit
ted in the fall.
Originally, the piece was more
controversial and dealt with issues
of rape and power; but after inter
nal reviews, Ram's I lead decided
to alter the script. Consequently,
the play is now more focused on
romance. Whitehurst plays the
lead role.
"It was an interesting dynamic ,
having the writer play lead role,
but it was also very useful to have
someone authorize me to make
changes and creative decisions, es
pecially because of the issues we
had with the script," Iskandar said.
fhe production staff was hired
last spring; sophomore Brooke
Fineberg is the producer. Ihe
scripts were read and selected by
committee and the artistic staff
was hired in the fall, with audi
tions held in mid-fall. Technical
production for the play started
then as well. Vince Dorie is the
technical director.
In the past, the One-Acts have
been extremely popular and have
often sold out. The Nitery seats just
80 people,and Fineberg said,'" I he
[One-Acts are] completely student
run, so nearly everyone knows
someone who is involved in some
way, and people like to see their
friends perform."
