## The 						Stanford Daily Don't ignore the condition of Stanford Stadium 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )!

Stanford likes to brag about its athletic
program, with good reason. The quality,
beauty and breadth of Stanford's athlet
ic facilities are matched by few other
plates in the world. But amid the sparkling
pools and gleaming fields lies the outdated and
uncomfortable Stanford Stadium. We urge the
I niversitv to renovate and modernize this an
cient. decaying structure soon.
First, the stadium is too large. Most of the
time, a significant portion of the 85,000 seats
are not filled and the stadium looks rather
emptv. Cheers and noise fade in the large
area, making the stadium sound dead. This is
demoralizing for players, coaches and fans,
especialh when compared to a near-capacity
( rowd in a smaller, louder stadium.
Also, because of its si/e. the stadium is not

intimate. Spectators in the highest rows are
far away from the action and the track
around the football field further removes all
fans from the action.
The structure is also falling apart rapidly.
The steps leading up to the east side of the sta
dium are steep and uneven, making them a
safety hazard. Also, some of the benches on
this side of the stadium have broken loose
from their supports, making sitting uncom
fortable and standing dangerous.
Many necessary features of the stadium
are also substandard. Wheelchair access is
tenuous at best, and the bathrooms and con
cession areas are cramped and unsanitary.
These problems are unacceptable in any
building, much less one that accommodates
85,000 people. In short, the stadium is not a

pleasant place to watch a football game.
A stadium renovation would be a judicious
use of the University's money, as the stadium
is the only facility that many campus visitors
see the inside of . Those who visit campus only
for football games would carry away a mistak
en impression of the state of Stanford's facili
ties. In this sense, an investment in the stadi
um is an investment in Stanford's local image.
The University is correct in waiting to see
if the Bay Area will host the 2012 Olympics
before planning a renovation. The prospect
of a free retrofit for the stadium is indeed ex
citing. But there is no reason the University
cannot begin fundraising and budgeting for
the project now. Raising the necessary
money fora renovation will take years. The
sooner the University starts raising money,

the sooner ii can begin the renovation if an
other city is chosen for the Olympics.
We appreciate that the University has
many difficult choices to make about how to
spend its money. Rightly, a stadium facelift is
a lower priority than building graduate stu
dent housing. Nevertheless, the attitude that
no changes will be made "in the foreseeable
future," as Provost John Etchemendy said,
shows a lac k of foresight and does not reflect
the poor condition of the stadium.
Stanford's other facilities — athletic and
academic — are world-class, without any
doubt. They physically represent the excel
lence that Stanford aspires to in all its en
deavors. Stanford Stadium, as one of the
University's most important and most-visited
sports facility, deserves nothing less.
