Graduate housing office exposed
I hanks to Rob Gaudet's column yes
terday the I diversity's Graduate I lous
ing Office is being exposed for the slum
lords the) are.
Charging market rents and providing
substandard facilities (e.g., heat) when you
don't have to pay for the land? I can un
derstand the struggles of property man
agers to make ends meet when there are
mortgages to pay . Hut to provide the ex
cuse thai vou need to sacrifice the- health
and comfort of your current residents to
the point of violating current codes in
order to save for future residents is entire
ly inappropriate. And to c harge market
rents to financ iallv strapped graduate stu
dents when it isn't needed to make ends
meet is obscene.
Based on the heating fiasco, Diane
Conklin should either be moved to other
responsibilities or terminated. Not only
has she apparently willingly broken the
law. she seems to be rather belligerent in
her ignorance of requests to explain her
actions. Perhaps an administrative hear
ing w ill end her defiant silence.
The I nivcrsity has indicated that im
proving graduate housing is among its top
priorities. It's time to walk the walk and
make sure that it is a top priority today, not
just in some future time.

Gaudet rebuts arguments of Benjamin Ho
In his recent letter, Benjamin Ho ac
cused me of "propagating the same
myths" that made the words "liberal" and
"progressive" sound dirty in the past. As
economist, 110 probably thinks the
whole world Ix'haves in accordance with
mathematical models. He is wrong. He of
fers three myths of his own to support the
idea of laissez-faire < apitalism.
First, he claims that "t hains imposed by
government" have locked down our

human potential. 1 his is a myth. History
has shown that government unlocks po
tential by eradicating racial discrimina
tion, providing serv ices unavailable in the
private sector; and inventing new tech
nologies such as the Internet.
(Corporations around the globe come to
the United States to raise capital, issue
debt offerings and conduct business,
i hat's because we have the best sec urities
markets in the world. The Securities and
Exchange (Commission, the Federal
hade (Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of justice and other au
thorities have ensured that we have the
highest standards of disclosure, fair play
and honesty in the world.
Second, he claims the Scandinavian
states are "blond-haired blue-eyed
Aryans". It is true that Norway is much
more homogenous than the United States
in terms of racial, cultural and ethnic di
versity. I lowevet , ii is a myth to say that all
Norwegians look like Rebecca Romjin.
Most of them have brown hair.
I bird, I lo claims that "most of the poor
in this country are the newly arrived" and
that "their children tend mostly to rise up
in American society." I le offers no empir
ical data. 11 lis is an Kllis Island myth that
no longer holds true. Ho would like to
think this is the primary cause of poverty
because, like most conservatives, he does
not want to deal with real problems which
are much more complex.

Ho apologizes, clarifies point
Editor's Mote: This If Iter is in response to Steuwft
Neilson \ letter ("Xorrnay referentes 'near-racist'
an/1 'rea/hon/ny'") in yesterday's Daily.
I wanted to apologize for the slight I
may have made toward your people or
your country. It was written while impas
sioned, and I did recognize that one par
ticular statement was a bit controversial.
Mistaking Norwegian for Scandinavian

was a regrettable and humiliating mistake,
and I apologize for whatever offense I may
have caused as a result of it.
Though iu my defense, we all make mis
lakes in our writing, just as you did when
you left out a "not" implying that your
African-Norwegian friend did indeed feel
animosity from other Norwegians.
As for the Scandinavian immigration
policy, I do ac knowledge that as a people,
most Europeans —as I have seen
through my visiisto Europe and my Scan
dinavian friends — are very tolerant and
welcoming toward individual members of
other cultures, likely more so than most
Americans.
I lowever, you must also admit that the
immigration policy of most European na
tions, sounds identical to that which is es
poused by Pal Buchanan. They are in
deed anti-immigration, and the reason
often given is that such diversity would
damage their culture. Therefore, the de
notation of my statement is indisputable.
And before taking too much offense at
that, let me say that, in my opinion,
Buchanan is 100 easily dismissed out of
hand. His ideas regarding immigration
are no more extreme than that which is
taken for granted in Europe. I was mere
ly pointing out this correspondence.
I do recognize the nuance differentiat
ing tolerance by a people, and tolerance to
ward immigration asa national policy. I did
think about it but I chose to leave it out chic*
to rhetorical simplicity. Perhaps I should
have been more careful with my words.
I lowever, ac barge of racism is a strong,
heavy-handed, dangerous accusation.
Perhaps you should be more c areful with
your words as well.

Defending the theory of evolution
Stephen Doane's Jan. 11 response to
my Jan. 10 letter reveals one of the more
frustrating aspects of'attempting to discuss
scientific matters with creationists: in die
space of .1 few short paragraphs, the\ can
fire oil enough misleading and downright
dishonest kitty litter that it would take sev
eral volumes to detail .ill of the mistakes
that are being made. And that, of'course, is
what they rely on, both in the sound-bite
world of the editorial page and the rabble
rousing world of the public debate.
1 his is perhaps whv one finds lew, il
any, real issues in science (e.g., methods
for overcoming antibiotic resistance, tec li
niques for curing genetic diseases, etc.)
being resolved in such venues.
But lest the reader believe that there is
substance to I)oane's tirade, let's take as .in
example one of the assertions in his re
sponse to nn letter:
"| Mr. Shapiro] c alls "dubious" the orga
nization's theory that the earth has .i rela
tively young age, but he makes that c laim
without addressing the scientific evidence
that Ai( i uses to support its theory.'
In the first place, my previous letter was
mainly addressed to pointing out Doane's
hypocrisy in accusing scientists of in
dulging in uncritical bias, without reveal
ing the far greatei conceptual prejudices
of his sources.
In that context, a digression into I he
detailed flaws of the uarticular creation

ist pages I cited was not particularly ap
propriate. Instead, I provided the ad
dress of <i site that addresses them
(www.talkorigins.org) and assumed that
interested individuals would peruse it
before acc using me of dodging the issue.
Apparently, in Doane's case, (his as
sumption was incorrect.
I v\ ill have to forego extended comment
on the lac I tli.it while there are scientists of
innumerable religions faiths (or of no faith
at all) that have reviewed the available evi
dence and all come to consensus on many
of the points Doane attacks, the form ol
creationism he espouses is prett\ much
limited to a panicular tvpe of fundamen
talist. I again relei the interested reader to
www.talkorigins.org, where quite a lew ol
the detailed links can be lound.
I )oane devotes much of his response to
< liallenging the integrity ol'sc ientists, stat
ing tli.it they're unwilling to address the
supposedly valid points that creationists
ha\ e made. But consider I his: the Web site
I reference has numerous prominent
links to creationist Web sites (including
the Answers in (icnesis one), often juxta
posing them with the arguments to which
they refer.
B\ wav of contrast, the one reference I
could find to the talk.origins Web site on
the Aid page (by using the Web site's
search feature) merely printed an abbrevi
ation lor its name, without linking to it.
\or does the "Kvidence fora young earth"
page link to even ;i single one of the nu
merous web pages that cliredlv address
(and as directlv refute) its "arguments".

Evidently, the failti ol the \i(. people in
their own arguments is so weak, they t an t
even link to a sin- that presents evidence
that they haven't pre-liltered. I lie reader
is free to draw whatever com lusions from
this that you wish.

Letters used 'flawed' arguments
Two letters in this section on Jan. 14 de
fended the evolutionary theoi x of Origins,
but they both used a common argument
that is flawed. Yves Konigshofer men
tioned antihiotu resistance saying, "Surely,
this is an example of evolution and Dar
win's principle of the survival of the fittest."
llalaji Srinivasan mentioned engi
neering optimization with evolutionary
algorithms to prove the validit\ of Dar
winian theory. I he common mistake
they made is to combine Spec ial I heorx
ol Evolution (small-scale) and General
Theory of Evolution (large-scale) and
call them both "evolution" as though
they were the same cone ept.
Antibiotic resistance is certainly an ob
servable example of evolution. What sci
entists call the Special Theory. Random
mutation changes .111 organism's pheno
type in a way that helps it survive and
propagate those beneficial tiaiis. ('.realion
scientists don't dispute the validil\ of 1 )ar
vvinian natural selection for generating
variation within a species. (In fact, cre
ationist Edward Blvth discussed natural

selection 25 years before Darwin pub
lished "(Jrigin of Spec ies")
However, General Theory recjnires
ili.it an organism increase its specified
complexity over time, resulting in large
scale developments siu li as clogs evol\ ing
from bat teria. I he dogs have more genet
ic information than the bacteria so thc\
are more complex.
Check out www.trueorigin.org/dawk
inlo.asp fora discussion on the implica
tions of information 1 heorx for evolution.
N'evei in the natural world lias a random
process been observed to develop in
creased genetic information.
Srinivasan's evolutionary algorittuns can
increase the available information content,
but they use a contrived environment that
does not relate to real-world conditions. Ad
ditionally, the creation of that environment
requires parameters programmed by an in
telligent designer. See www.answersingen
esis.org/hoine area/faq/docs genetic algo
rithm.asp for more specifics. These algo
rithms certainly demonstrate the value and
integrity of natural selection principles, but
they tit) not in any wax substantiate an exo
lutionary theory of origins.
The end result of bacterial mutations
is simply more bacteria. The result of op
timizing a crane-arm in Srinivasan's ex
ample is simply more crane-arms. Even
with animal special ion caused In genetic
drift, mice only produce other types of
mice; finches only produce different
types of finches.
In fact, the inabilitx of nexv species to
breed with each other (a criterion for spe

(ial ion) arises bee ause each species lias los
some ffeneik capabilit\ from its ancestors
whose genes contained the informatior
for both progeny.
I he tvpe of evolution necessary for ar
evolutionar\ theorv of origins has nevei
been observed bv scientists, and never wil
be. I herelore, scientists who discovei
"evolution in action" should identify i
dearh a> an example ol Special Theory
and should not espouse grander conclu
sions about our origins that are unwar
ranted by the data.
