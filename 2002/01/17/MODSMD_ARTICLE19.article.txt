Graduate housing office exposed
I hanks to Rob Gaudet's column yes
terday the I diversity's Graduate I lous
ing Office is being exposed for the slum
lords the) are.
Charging market rents and providing
substandard facilities (e.g., heat) when you
don't have to pay for the land? I can un
derstand the struggles of property man
agers to make ends meet when there are
mortgages to pay . Hut to provide the ex
cuse thai vou need to sacrifice the- health
and comfort of your current residents to
the point of violating current codes in
order to save for future residents is entire
ly inappropriate. And to c harge market
rents to financ iallv strapped graduate stu
dents when it isn't needed to make ends
meet is obscene.
Based on the heating fiasco, Diane
Conklin should either be moved to other
responsibilities or terminated. Not only
has she apparently willingly broken the
law. she seems to be rather belligerent in
her ignorance of requests to explain her
actions. Perhaps an administrative hear
ing w ill end her defiant silence.
The I nivcrsity has indicated that im
proving graduate housing is among its top
priorities. It's time to walk the walk and
make sure that it is a top priority today, not
just in some future time.

Gaudet rebuts arguments of Benjamin Ho
In his recent letter, Benjamin Ho ac
cused me of "propagating the same
myths" that made the words "liberal" and
"progressive" sound dirty in the past. As
economist, 110 probably thinks the
whole world Ix'haves in accordance with
mathematical models. He is wrong. He of
fers three myths of his own to support the
idea of laissez-faire < apitalism.
First, he claims that "t hains imposed by
government" have locked down our

human potential. 1 his is a myth. History
has shown that government unlocks po
tential by eradicating racial discrimina
tion, providing serv ices unavailable in the
private sector; and inventing new tech
nologies such as the Internet.
(Corporations around the globe come to
the United States to raise capital, issue
debt offerings and conduct business,
i hat's because we have the best sec urities
markets in the world. The Securities and
Exchange (Commission, the Federal
hade (Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of justice and other au
thorities have ensured that we have the
highest standards of disclosure, fair play
and honesty in the world.
Second, he claims the Scandinavian
states are "blond-haired blue-eyed
Aryans". It is true that Norway is much
more homogenous than the United States
in terms of racial, cultural and ethnic di
versity. I lowevet , ii is a myth to say that all
Norwegians look like Rebecca Romjin.
Most of them have brown hair.
I bird, I lo claims that "most of the poor
in this country are the newly arrived" and
that "their children tend mostly to rise up
in American society." I le offers no empir
ical data. 11 lis is an Kllis Island myth that
no longer holds true. Ho would like to
think this is the primary cause of poverty
because, like most conservatives, he does
not want to deal with real problems which
are much more complex.

Ho apologizes, clarifies point
Editor's Mote: This If Iter is in response to Steuwft
Neilson \ letter ("Xorrnay referentes 'near-racist'
an/1 'rea/hon/ny'") in yesterday's Daily.
I wanted to apologize for the slight I
may have made toward your people or
your country. It was written while impas
sioned, and I did recognize that one par
ticular statement was a bit controversial.
Mistaking Norwegian for Scandinavian

was a regrettable and humiliating mistake,
and I apologize for whatever offense I may
have caused as a result of it.
Though iu my defense, we all make mis
lakes in our writing, just as you did when
you left out a "not" implying that your
African-Norwegian friend did indeed feel
animosity from other Norwegians.
As for the Scandinavian immigration
policy, I do ac knowledge that as a people,
most Europeans —as I have seen
through my visiisto Europe and my Scan
dinavian friends — are very tolerant and
welcoming toward individual members of
other cultures, likely more so than most
Americans.
I lowever, you must also admit that the
immigration policy of most European na
tions, sounds identical to that which is es
poused by Pal Buchanan. They are in
deed anti-immigration, and the reason
often given is that such diversity would
damage their culture. Therefore, the de
notation of my statement is indisputable.
And before taking too much offense at
that, let me say that, in my opinion,
Buchanan is 100 easily dismissed out of
hand. His ideas regarding immigration
are no more extreme than that which is
taken for granted in Europe. I was mere
ly pointing out this correspondence.
I do recognize the nuance differentiat
ing tolerance by a people, and tolerance to
ward immigration asa national policy. I did
think about it but I chose to leave it out chic*
to rhetorical simplicity. Perhaps I should
have been more careful with my words.
I lowever, ac barge of racism is a strong,
heavy-handed, dangerous accusation.
Perhaps you should be more c areful with
your words as well.
