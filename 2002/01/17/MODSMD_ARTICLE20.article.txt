need to beat a couple to place in
that top four," said Buddie.
While performing well at the
I'ac-lOs remains the team's ulti
mate goal, Stanford is not look

the team's on its schedule before
then.
Surely, those teams will not
overlook the Cardinal. "We're
not a national champion
wrestling team, but teams still
gun for us like we are," Buddie
said. "People come out wanting
to beat Stanford, no matter what
the sport."
