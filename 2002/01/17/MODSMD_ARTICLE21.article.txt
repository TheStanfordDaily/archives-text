# The
						Sixth Man Syndrome: Stupidity
## 
### 
As the typical Stanford Sixth Man fan, I
feel compelled to sa\ I'm pissed. Alter
three straight years of using m\ cheer
ing prowess to push Stanford to college
basketball success, I should be able to weai m\
red Stanford basketb.ill shorts with pride alter
airballinga baseline floater oil the \\ ilbui com is.
I should be able to interi upt a spirited game
of online Doom with a sell-alfii mini;. berkelev
bashing piet e ol trash talk.
I sh< >uld be able to instantancoush inflate m\
self-worth wit h the kmÂ»\\ ledge that I kn< >w (okav.
lived in the same dorm as) a couple ol the play
ers (well, one of his girlfriends) on one ol the top
teams in the nation.
l or Ciod s sake, it's m\ right as a Stanford stu
dent to insinuate with our< level < beers that, not
onh are we kicking voin ass on the baski'tball

(ourt, but we're smaller than
you, too.
I>ut. I don'i know il I can
even show m\ fate in Maples
w hen W ashington Slate comes
< ailing tonight.
Its jusi no Inn when the
team's bad. I don't leel so big
<md bad and tough when thev
suck. And siu k lhe\ do.

I hev're onl\ 9-1. t hey're barcl\ ranked in
I he lop 20. I mean, we've been ranked \o. I in
each ol the past two seasons. Now this team
comes along, with what I've been told are lout
new starters and three freshman plaving regu
larh. I .ike that mallei s.
People tell me thai there arc .'iOO-some learns
in Division I but. even il that's true, Stanford's

barelx in the top 10 percent. II the basketball
team was applying to Stanford with a record like
that, it wouldn't even get in. I hat's not the kind
ol excellence Stanford should be striving lor.
I hex couldn't exen beat Oregon in f.ugene
last weekend.
People tell me that Oregon swept .Arizona,
that tliex destroxed them In 30 points and .u 111-
all\ beat the mightx Wildt atsin the M< Kale( '.en
ter. I'eople sax that Mat Arthur Com 1 is one ol
die toughest places to plax in the cot mm. People
sax our game xvas close. I don't know. I didn't
wall hit. I had to program.
But so xvhat il ii x\ as< lose. Stanford's \o. 19 in
the countrx Ihe I hicks are No. 2H. I hat's lour
spots in the rankings. I hat means we should
