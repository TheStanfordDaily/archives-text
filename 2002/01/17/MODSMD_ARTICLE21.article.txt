# The 						Sixth Man Syndrome: Stupidity
## 
### 
As the typical Stanford Sixth Man fan, I
feel compelled to sa\ I'm pissed. Alter
three straight years of using m\ cheer
ing prowess to push Stanford to college
basketball success, I should be able to weai m\
red Stanford basketb.ill shorts with pride alter
airballinga baseline floater oil the \\ ilbui com is.
I should be able to interi upt a spirited game
of online Doom with a sell-alfii mini;. berkelev
bashing piet e ol trash talk.
I sh< >uld be able to instantancoush inflate m\
self-worth wit h the km»\\ ledge that I kn< >w (okav.
lived in the same dorm as) a couple ol the play
ers (well, one of his girlfriends) on one ol the top
teams in the nation.
l or Ciod s sake, it's m\ right as a Stanford stu
dent to insinuate with our< level < beers that, not
onh are we kicking voin ass on the baski'tball

(ourt, but we're smaller than
you, too.
I>ut. I don'i know il I can
even show m\ fate in Maples
w hen W ashington Slate comes
< ailing tonight.
Its jusi no Inn when the
team's bad. I don't leel so big
<md bad and tough when thev
suck. And siu k lhe\ do.

I hev're onl\ 9-1. t hey're barcl\ ranked in
I he lop 20. I mean, we've been ranked \o. I in
each ol the past two seasons. Now this team
comes along, with what I've been told are lout
new starters and three freshman plaving regu
larh. I .ike that mallei s.
People tell me thai there arc .'iOO-some learns
in Division I but. even il that's true, Stanford's

barelx in the top 10 percent. II the basketball
team was applying to Stanford with a record like
that, it wouldn't even get in. I hat's not the kind
ol excellence Stanford should be striving lor.
I hex couldn't exen beat Oregon in f.ugene
last weekend.
People tell me that Oregon swept .Arizona,
that tliex destroxed them In 30 points and .u 111-
all\ beat the mightx Wildt atsin the M< Kale( '.en
ter. I'eople sax that Mat Arthur Com 1 is one ol
die toughest places to plax in the cot mm. People
sax our game xvas close. I don't know. I didn't
wall hit. I had to program.
But so xvhat il ii x\ as< lose. Stanford's \o. 19 in
the countrx Ihe I hicks are No. 2H. I hat's lour
spots in the rankings. I hat means we should


Jonathan Stull
beat I ItK'v, Louie, Dewey and crew.
But, instead, it was Stanford that
played like an outnumbered Uncle
I )< >nald in a c|iiack\ game of I )isney
cartoon basketball.
And what's this business about
Mac (ourt being as bad as Maples?
That's ridiculous — they don't have
any Stanford students at Oregon.
The crowd certainly can't be as
witty. And, il it's not as witty, how
can it be more intimidating?
'lo illustrate just how far the
team has fallen, here are some

downright shocking statistical facts:
1. In my first three years hereon
the Farm, we lost only 10 games.
I his season, the team's already lost
four! We've alreach surpassed our
statistical average.
2. In my time at Stanford, we've
lost to Oregon zero times in six
games. This season against the
Ducks, the team's already lost one
time in one game! We dropped
from a 1.000 winning percentage to
0.000. That's (juite a few standard
deviations away from the norm.
It. We've won or tied for three
I'ac-lO titles in a row. With only 14
more conference games to go, the
team's already two-and-a-half
games out of first plate! Virtually

insurmountable.
To be honest, I probably won't
even go to the game.
What's the point if I can't < liant
"Who's your daddy**'"
How much luu is basketball il I
can't yell "single digits" at the other
team hallway through the first hall?
Why even cheer lor Stanlbrd il
it's not dominatingeveryoneelse?
1 don't know. Maybe if we start
winning I'll start going to some
games again.
I guess we still have an outside
shot at the tournament. II things
lall right, we could sneak in before
losing to one of those really good
teams like Michigan State or ('al.
And, who knows? Technically, I

guess, we could go on some cra/y
winning streak and actually get
good again or something.
But until that happens, until I
t .in see )iilins pull oil one ol those
realh awesome between-t lie-leg
dribbles, until I can see Stanford se
riouslv pounding on some other
team, until I can walk into the stadi
um with my chest pulled out with
pride, I'm not going in there again.
Because, let's get real, I'm a
Stanlbrd student. I'm a winner. 1
shouldn't have to waste my time
cheering lor these losers.

And what's this business about
Mac (ourt being as bad as Maples?
That's ridiculous — they don't have
any Stanford students at Oregon.
The crowd certainly can't be as
witty. And, il it's not as witty, how
can it be more intimidating?
'lo illustrate just how far the
team has fallen, here are some

downright shocking statistical facts:
1. In my first three years hereon
the Farm, we lost only 10 games.
I his season, the team's already lost
four! We've alreach surpassed our
statistical average.
2. In my time at Stanford, we've
lost to Oregon zero times in six
games. This season against the
Ducks, the team's already lost one
time in one game! We dropped
from a 1.000 winning percentage to
0.000. That's (juite a few standard
deviations away from the norm.
It. We've won or tied for three
I'ac-lO titles in a row. With only 14
more conference games to go, the
team's already two-and-a-half
games out of first plate! Virtually

insurmountable.
To be honest, I probably won't
even go to the game.

How much luu is basketball il I

it's not dominatingeveryoneelse?
1 don't know. Maybe if we start
winning I'll start going to some
games again.
I guess we still have an outside
shot at the tournament. II things
lall right, we could sneak in before
losing to one of those really good
teams like Michigan State or ('al.
And, who knows? Technically, I

guess, we could go on some cra/y
winning streak and actually get
good again or something.
But until that happens, until I
t .in see )iilins pull oil one ol those
realh awesome between-t lie-leg
dribbles, until I can see Stanford se
riouslv pounding on some other
team, until I can walk into the stadi
um with my chest pulled out with
pride, I'm not going in there again.
Because, let's get real, I'm a
Stanlbrd student. I'm a winner. 1
shouldn't have to waste my time
cheering lor these losers.
