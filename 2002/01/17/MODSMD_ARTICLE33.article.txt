# Getting to the point: Suminski leads Card
## No. 4 Stanford will count on a freshman guard in Pac-10 play 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the women's basketball team
goes into the final stretch of Pacif
ic 10 Conference play, everything
is starting to come together.
After dominating both Ore
gon State (S-8, 4-3 Pac-10) and
Oregon (9-7, 4-3), the No. 4 Car
dinal (Hi-1,6-0) travels north this
weekend to face both Washing
ton (9-7, 4-3) and Washington
State (2-15, 0-7).
I'his weekend's games will test
the Cardinal, as the Huskies have
the second-most prolific offense
in the Pac-10, averaging 74.1
points per game. Washington has
yet to lose a conference home
game, but a loss to the Cardinal

would crush its already slim con
ference title hopes. On the other
hand, the Cougars have had a dis
appointing season, shooting only
34 percent.
Last weekend's games dis
placed sophomore Nicole Powell's
dominance. Powell finished the
Oregon State contest one assist
short of a triple double, and then
followed it up with a school record
21 rebounds against Oregon.
I he games also illustrated the
Cardinal's strength in the middle,
as senior Lauren St. Clair and
freshman T'Nae Thiel played well
in the paint. Their strong play lias
helped senior center Bethany
Donaphin, who has been playing
excellent interior defense.
The last piece of the puzzle fi
nally seems to have fallen into
place as freshman Kelley Sumins
ki has assumed the role of starting
point guard. Last week, the Car

With the season-ending injury to sophomore Susan King, freshman Kelley
Suminski will play point guard for No. 4 Stanford.
dinal announced that sophomore
Susan King would sit out the rest
of the season with a stretclied an
terior cruciate ligament in her
right knee. King was expected to
start at point guard before the
season but had been hampered
by injur) all season, playing in
only two games.
The team has had no stable
starter at the point, with King
starting two games, freshman Kel
ley Suminski eight, and fellow
freshman Sebnem Kimyacioglu
six. As I'ac-lO play comes into full
swing, it appears that Suminski is
prepared to take over.
In conference games, Suminski
has been averaging 11.3 points to
go along with her 4.2 assists per
contest. She has cut down on
turnovers and is now the primary

person in charge of bringing the
ball up the court.
"She is a student of the game,"
said head coach I ara VanDerveer
after the ()regon State game. "She
understands what our team needs
and really responds."
Suminski has had to make the
transition from a shooting guard,
her position in high school, to a
point guard.
"1 have been learning a lot
about the position and how to
handle the ball better," Sumins
ki said.
As the Cardinal eyes the Final
Four, point play will be essential
to making a run deep into March,
file team is full of capable scorers
as every player, including Sumin
ski, is capable of putting up dou
ble figures. With senior l.indsey
Yamasaki paired with Powell on
the wings, the (Cardinal has devel
oped a powerful inside-outside
game. However, this is useless il
the scorers can't get the balls in

their hands.
"1 feel my responsibility is lo
control the offense, Suminski
said. "1 have to make sure we're
doing the right thing: make sure
we're doing what (loach wants us
to do, relaying whatever Coach
wants us to do to the rest of the
team and making sure everyone is
organized and on the same page."
Last weekend, Suminski at
times seemed excellent, finish
ing the Oregon State game with
eight assists. However, against
the Ducks, she finished with onl\
two assists.
"I'm going to work on push
ing the ball so we get more points
off our fast breaks," Suminski
said. "Lindsey and Nicole are
doing a great job of running, and
so are Bethany and Cori [Kn
ghusenj. They're all doing a
great job of running the lanes, so
if I can just push the ball more
and get it to them it would help
us out a lot."
