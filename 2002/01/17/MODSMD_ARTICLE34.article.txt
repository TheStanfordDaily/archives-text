# Casey hopes for offensive help

### AARON LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
It's been pretty simple the past few years.
Washington State at home? Tally a win.
Washington? Do it again.
The streak at Maples Pavilion against the
Cougars is five games and against the Huskies
it's eight. Victories over the two schools were al
most inevitable, and even Stanford's players
knew it.
"We'd be playing Washington, and people
would be asking us about I he Arizona game the
following week," junior wingman Casey Jacob
sen said.
Not this week, though.
Not with a No. 19 Cardinal team, which has
lost two of its last three games.
Not with a Stanford team that is 2-2 in con
ference play for the first time since 1996.
And certainly not against two Washington
teams that are as hungry as ever fora win.
Forget that the Huskies are 1-5 in Pacific 10
(Conference play and t he (Cougars are 0-6. tight
of those 1 1 losses have come against UCLA and
USC, a byproduct of having to play them two
conference weekends in a row.
"They're an improved basketball team," Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery said. " They've just
been victims of not quite being able to handle
that schedule. That's a tough deal."
Stanford (9-4, 2-2 Pac-10) knows all about
tough deals, in both the losses to (California and
Oregon, the Cardinal could have potentially
won if not for miscues down the stretch.
Turnovers led toa 14-6Colden Bear run in the
latter stages of the defeat at I laas Pavilion, and
two more turnovers sealed the loss at
MacArthiir Court last week.
But this is home. This is Maples. And de
spite the improvements of both Washington
schools, these are must-win games for Mont
gomery's squad.
"If you're capable of winning, you better get
the sweep," Montgomery said. "If you want to
be considered in the top four in this league, you
can't afford to slip up."
That means that a third man has to step up
and become a scoring threat, junior Curtis Bor
cliardt and Jacobsen are clearly carrying the
team — they scored 61 of its 79 points against
Oregon — and someone else needs to help for it
to have any chance at a conference crown.
When someone else has contributed, Stan
ford has won. In its victory over Cal, junior
Julius Barnes scored a career-high 27 points,
and in its win over Oregon State, fresh man Josh
Childress had 19.
"I'd like everyone playing at their best
consistently, but that hasn't happened so far
this season," Montgomery said. "Curtis,
Julius and | ustin | Davis] are all capable of big
scoring nights."
Team defense is also an issue. It seemed as
though Oregon scored at will every time down
the court last week, and its 87 points were the
most the Cardinal had given up since last year's
NCAA Elite Tight loss to Maryland.
"We haven't quite come along. We have tal
ent. It's just a matter of putting it together on
the court and gelling as a group," said senior

point guard Tony Ciovacc hini. "It's frustrating
in some ways, but it could make it very exciting
down the stretch."
The Cardinal plays Washington State
tonight at 7 p.m. The Cougars, who have lost
their last eight games, usually play a three
guard offense, similar to what Stanford saw in
its season opener at New Mexico.
Sophomore guard Marcus Moore averages
14.4 points per game and senior J Locklier is
averaging 13.7. I he Cardinal must be wary of

senior Mike Bush and junior Jerry McNair.
Bush, a wide receiver for the football team,
is still adjusting to the court after rejoining
the team. McNair, on the other hand, explod
ed for 29 points against Stanford at Maples
last year.
"We have a habit of giving kids career
games," Montgomery said. "I le was just on fire
that night and really came out of nowhere."

Junior wingman Casey Jacobsen has scored big for the No. 19 Cardinal this season, averaging 1 9.9
points per game. He will need his teammates to follow suit if a conference title is in his sights.
