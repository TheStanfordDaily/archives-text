# HANGIN' TOUGH WITH THE
## New kids on the farm 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
Sure, it would be easy enough to call them the New
Kids on the Block.
But test assured, the mountain facing freshmen
teammates Josh Childress, Chris I lernandez and Rob
Little shouldn't be reduced to a mole hill of short-lived
pop culture icons. .
Freshman year can Ik- hard enough without the pres
sure of playing fora nationally ranked basketballteam.
For the most part, all Stanford freshmen engage in
a similar first year experience here on the Farm.
There's I HUM and PVVR and adjusting to life away
from home, indulging in the pleasures of parental
freedom and for some, suffering the consequences of
that over-indulgence.
But for Childress, Hernandez and Little, the first
year of college is about more than papers and fiat par
ties. They are getting an introduction to a different
kind of Stanford — a unique experience, one that has
already exceeded prior expectations and 'forced
reevaluations of self.
"For me the season has been kind of disappointing
these last few days with the two losses," Little, a 6-foot
-10 center, said." But as far as my expectations for what
it would be like to play at Stanford, I expec ted there to
be a lot of hype and I expected that everyone would
be head hunting for lis, which is true."
"Obviously we've lost a couple games and every
thing isn't going quite the way we would have liked it
to," Childress said. "But I'm optimistic about the rest

of the season."
And so is the test of the team, which is why the
young guys can be a breath ot fresh air at times.
"()ther than the fact that they like to call me late at
night to take them to get food, they're okay," said ju
nior guard Julius Barnes. " They're playing very well
so fiu this season as compared to my freshman year,
when only Casey [Jacobsen] really contributed.
I hey'veall stepped in and fulfilled the roles that we've
needed them to fulfill."
And head coach Mike Montgomery has asked a lot
of his freshmen thus far.
They have had to show maturity despite youthful
ness and they have to fit into a puzzle of players as if
they've been there all along.
Personality wise, they seem to be fitting in fine with
the older guys.
"p lie older guys] are pretty cool," Childress said.
"I mean they're older than us but they still treat nslike
normal people — they don't treat us like the scrubs or
anything, so that's pretty cool. It's been fun."
So far it seems that Montgomery's assessment of
the freshman has been mixed.
"You never know how certain kids are going to
react in a certain environment," Montgomery said.
It seems, however, that he is becoming more and
more comfortable with them as players as the season
progresses. I )espite the fact that Childress is no longer
in the starting lineup, Montgomery leans upon |osh
to be a prevalent scoring threat off the bench.

Childress, ;i O-foot-H guard/
forward, came oil the bench and
scored 19 points to lead the (Cardi
nal !o \ it ton against Oregon State
when Jacobsen was saddled with
three fouls early in the first half.
Lately Hernandez has had the
opportunity to step into a more
prominent role on the team as both

a team leader and a c runch time
player after starting out the season
on the bench with back spasms.
In the recent loss to Oregon,
Montgomery opted to leave
I lernandez in at the point guard
position in the game's final min
utes as opposed to senior Tony
(iiovac c liini.
"In retrospect, it might have
been an unfair situation to put a
freshman in," Montgomery said.
"It's hard to play point guard in
our offense. I o have a freshman

come in and set things up is tough.
Iherearea lot of subtleties he's still
learning."
I lernande/s lac k of game expe
rience showed in the loss to Ore
gon. In the final minutes of the
game I lernande/ was involved in
two pivotal turnovers that sealed
the deal lor the Cardinal.
Montgomery later attributed
the mistakes to youth, writing them
off as "adrenaline turnovers."
"It shows how much confidence
Coach has in (lln is, leaving him in

dur ing the last five minutes of the
game," Barnes said. "It shows how
much he's learned."
Little, like most of Stanford's big
men, is still struggling to find a
place in this complicated offense.
For the time being he has proven
himself a compotent rebounder
who can give both junior Curtis
Borchardt and sophomore Justin
Davis a blow when needed.
For all three, the transition be
tween high school glory and their
new collegiate reality hasn't been a

Cakewalk. Each has struggled in
his own way to figure out his new
role on the team, taking criticisms
from the coaching staff and the
media in stride.
If there is one unifying charac
teristic that is pervasive in this fresh
man trio, it's humility. Each has
been forced in the last I I games to
reevaluate their shortcomings and
to figure out what role they need to
play in order to become a produc
tive member of this presently strug
gling Cardinal squad.

"I need to improve on every
thing. Defense, offense my foot
work, everything," Little said. "I
need to rebound, be a big physical
presence inside and give some re
lief to the big guys."
But there is no transition peri
od afforded to them here. No year
to redshirt. No extra time to learn
the system.
I laving the poise to step into a
game and make a difference now is
the obstacle that these three young
men are faced with.
