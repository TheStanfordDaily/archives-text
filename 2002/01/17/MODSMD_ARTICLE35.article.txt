# HANGIN' TOUGH WITH THE
## New kids on the farm 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
Sure, it would be easy enough to call them the New
Kids on the Block.
But test assured, the mountain facing freshmen
teammates Josh Childress, Chris I lernandez and Rob
Little shouldn't be reduced to a mole hill of short-lived
pop culture icons. .
Freshman year can Ik- hard enough without the pres
sure of playing fora nationally ranked basketballteam.
For the most part, all Stanford freshmen engage in
a similar first year experience here on the Farm.
There's I HUM and PVVR and adjusting to life away
from home, indulging in the pleasures of parental
freedom and for some, suffering the consequences of
that over-indulgence.
But for Childress, Hernandez and Little, the first
year of college is about more than papers and fiat par
ties. They are getting an introduction to a different
kind of Stanford — a unique experience, one that has
already exceeded prior expectations and 'forced
reevaluations of self.
"For me the season has been kind of disappointing
these last few days with the two losses," Little, a 6-foot
-10 center, said." But as far as my expectations for what
it would be like to play at Stanford, I expec ted there to
be a lot of hype and I expected that everyone would
be head hunting for lis, which is true."
"Obviously we've lost a couple games and every
thing isn't going quite the way we would have liked it
to," Childress said. "But I'm optimistic about the rest

of the season."
And so is the test of the team, which is why the
young guys can be a breath ot fresh air at times.
"()ther than the fact that they like to call me late at
night to take them to get food, they're okay," said ju
nior guard Julius Barnes. " They're playing very well
so fiu this season as compared to my freshman year,
when only Casey [Jacobsen] really contributed.
I hey'veall stepped in and fulfilled the roles that we've
needed them to fulfill."
And head coach Mike Montgomery has asked a lot
of his freshmen thus far.
They have had to show maturity despite youthful
ness and they have to fit into a puzzle of players as if
they've been there all along.
Personality wise, they seem to be fitting in fine with
the older guys.
"p lie older guys] are pretty cool," Childress said.
"I mean they're older than us but they still treat nslike
normal people — they don't treat us like the scrubs or
anything, so that's pretty cool. It's been fun."
So far it seems that Montgomery's assessment of
the freshman has been mixed.
"You never know how certain kids are going to
react in a certain environment," Montgomery said.
It seems, however, that he is becoming more and
more comfortable with them as players as the season
progresses. I )espite the fact that Childress is no longer
in the starting lineup, Montgomery leans upon |osh
to be a prevalent scoring threat off the bench.
