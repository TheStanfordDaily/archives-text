# No. 2 Florida takes LSU on a walk
## 
### 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) —
LSU coach John Brady enjoyed a
brisk walk around campus.
Everyone else who came to watch
Florida play last night saw the sec
ond-ranked Gators put on their
most dominating performance of
tlie season.
Brett Nelson equaled his ca
reer-high with 2f> points to lift the
Gators to a 102-70 victory, their
biggest Southeastern Gonference
win since coach Billy Donovan ar
rived in 1995.
Florida (15-1,4-0) also matt bed
a school record with its 11th
straight SEG victory and extended
another school record with its 14th
straight win overall.
It was a lull. 40-minute effort —
17 minutes more than Brady was
willing to watch. Referee Doug
Shows ejected Brady when the
coach refused to move away 112 rom
center court moments after lohn

Glougherty hit him with his first
technical.
"I didn't watch the game,"
Brady said when asked what he did
after he got tossed. "In lad, I
walked outside and walketl around
campus. It's a pretty campus. But it
was a little chilly outside."
Nelson wasn't the onlv one set
ting personal bests for the Gators.
Orien Greene had 14 points and
I 1 assists, both career-highs, and
Ldonis Haslem matched bis ca
reer-high with Hi rebounds to go
with bis 20 points.
" The one thing I told the guys
was to shoot the ball with freedom
and confidence," Donovan said.
Indeed they did, makingOO per
cent of their shots, in< hiding going
12-of-2f> from It-point range.
"i think they deserve to be the
No. I team." LSU forward Ronald
Duprec said. "I haven't playetl
Duke, but I have seen them on

IV. Ibis Florida team is deep.
I'hey're just good. I hey playetl
very well tonight."
I he loss was a startling detour
loi LSU (11-5, 1-2), which fell be
hind :»2-l2 after 14 minutes and
had as many turnovers as points
(9) midwa) through the lirst half.
Before bis ejection, Brady was
the only form of entertainment
the Tigers could offer. He yelled
at players, officials, his own assis
tants, and at one point, got so
angry that be raised bis knees to
his (best, put both feet on the
edge of bis < hair and s( reamed in
frustration.
Much of his anger was diret ted
.it LSI \s biggest star, (iollis Tem
ple 111. I em pie had 15 points, but
they were all meaningless. Ibe
team's leading scorer this season
was invisible — both on the court
and '>ii the score sheet — until
LSI trailed SK-115 with 10:00 left.

Brady said he boiled over when
die Tigers didn't execute on of
fense, then followed by running
the wrong defense. A couple foul
(.ills he disagreed with sent him
over the edge.
"I've got my own thoughts
about that, but I'm not going to
share it with you," Brady said of
the fouls. "Because it wouldn't do
me any good. II I shared my
thoughts, I'd get two or three
reprimands like I did last year.
So, its just, ' lake it Coach,' and
move on."
I he (iators had too many high
lights to list.
Among them were James
White's steal and hip-twisting
dunk, David Lee's two-handed
jam and I laslem's easy dunk oil a
pass from Nelson, who went to the
Moor and scrapped hard fora loose
ball — even though his team was
ahead In '2') noinK
