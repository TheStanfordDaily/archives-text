# Lauren St. Clair:
## A 						TRUE TEAM PLAYER 
### TERRY HURLBUTT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has been a great year to be a spectator
at the women's basketball games and, from
all accounts, an even better year to be on
the court.
It's simpK fun to both watch and play.
I leadcoac li lara \ anDerveer has her pick
of one of the deepest benches in the na
tion; a bench that even includes past All-
I'ac ific 10 conference selections.
Senior guard Lauren St. Clair, a 1999-
2000 Pac-10 honorable mention selection,
gracefulk embodies the versatility and
depth this Stanford team boasts.
St. Clair has played a pivotal role in all
of No. I Stanford's 17 games this season,
.ind she has played that role after coming
oil the bench.
As a senior, the six-loot St. (Hair brings
three seasons of experience with her to the
court, int hiding 45 previous starts.
In the past she has played both the
guard and forward positions, and while
she attempted only one three-point shot in
hei senior year of high school, she is now
seventh in the Pac -1 0 in c areer three-point
percentage made at 10.2.
I ler delensive skills are not to be over
looked either.
"She can guard a three or a four," said
senioi centev Cori Enghusen. "And il
there's a guard that's real tough for us to
mat( li up with, we put [St. Clair] on her."
St. Clair's contributions are key to the
Cardinal strategy. She is averaging 5.6

points a game this season and 6.7 in con
ference play, producing big games when
her team needed her most.
1 his season alone, St. Clair scored 12
points in the final 1 1 minutes to lead her
team to a victory over Hawaii and
played a pivotal role as Stanford came
from behind against Oregon, scoring a
season-high 17 points that included
11 iree three-pointers.
"[My strengths are] consistency and
versatility," St. Clair said. "I like to think I
come in and play smart defense and help
facilitate the offense. I just help the team."
She helps the team in ways far more in
tangible than the consistent numbers she
puts in the book.
"[St. (Ilaii J comes in and gives us a huge
spark and she brings a certain calmness to
the floor." said freshman guard kelley
Suminski. "She makes us think. She's a
very steady player and a very smart player.
She gets things started for us."
St. ( lair's past experience has made her
a leader on a team of pervasive talent. She
demonstrates dedication, intelligence and
motivation. More importantly, she plays
hard and does her job every time she steps
onto the court.
"This year's a little different," St. Clair
said. "1 think I'm a leader in the fact that
I'm positive all the time and I try to be as
consistent as I can."
"M\ role has changed a little bit, but I
think in some ways my role is more impor
tant this year because I can show that you
don't need to start and that everyone is im

portant on the team."
Selflessness and maturity are really the
crux of this once-beaten Stanford team.
I lie fact that the team is able to go so deep
and continue to produce this mix of ath
leticism and leadership is at the core of the
Cardinal's success.
St. Clair's contributions will be crucial
in the upcoming months, beginning this
weekend as Stanford heads to Washing
ton to try and finish undefeated in con
ference play.
Playing the aggressive ball the Card
loves, including its smothering transition
game, requires a team effort. If the team is
to infill its Final Four goals, everyone will
need to step up and fulfill the role required
of her. They need look no farther than St.
("lair for an example.
This Cardinal team is playing its best
basketball in years because it puts the team
first, both on the court and off.
Ask St. Clair what her favorite memo
ries are of Stanford basketball and neither
I'ac-1 0 championships nor NCAA, appear
ances are on the list.
"It's definitely my teammates," said
St. Clair. "'l'he friends I've made and my
senior class have been absolutely amaz
ing and has made this experience as
great as it is."
"That's why I came to Stanford â€” to
play on a team like this," St. Clair said. "We
have a lot of fun off the floor and on the
floor. We have great chemistry."
I hat much is obvious to anyone who's
been watching this season.
