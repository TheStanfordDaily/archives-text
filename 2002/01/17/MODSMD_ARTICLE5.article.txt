"As biomedical science continues to develop at a
rapid pace, our society must confront increasingly dil
fic ult ethical questions," the White I louse's statement
said. "The Council will keep the President and out
nation apprised of new developments and pro\ ide a
forum for discussion and evaluation of these pro
found issues."
