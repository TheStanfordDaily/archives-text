# New courses explore impact of Sept. 11
## 
### GEORGE K. TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four months follow ing the events of Sept.
I I, Stanford continues to offer a broad selec
tion of lectures and seminars that focus on
terrorism, international security and the Is
lamic world.
The Intel national Relations program is
sponsoring the majority of courses related to
the terrorist attacks and their aftermath this
quarter.
Prof Donald Etnmerson, a senior fellow at
the Institute lor International Studies, is teach
ing IR 121: "Beyond Jihad: Indonesia in Glob
al Perspective."'
"Students in IR 121 this quarter will explore
issues regarding Islam, globalization and
American policy with particular reference to
Indonesia," Kmmerson said.
Indonesia is a particularly relevant country
to examine for two reasons, Kmmerson said.
"More Muslims live in Indonesia than in any
other country," he said. "Additionally, news re
ports have suggested that Southeast Asia could
become the next front in America's anti-terror
ist campaign."

Students who would like to investigate
domestic concerns instead may be interest
ed in IR 194: "American foreign Polic\ after
Sept. I I
Larry Diamond, senior lellow at the I loover
Institution and a lecturer for the course, said
the class will look at American polio trade-offs
and implications.
"It is a series of thematic seminars to explore
challenges confronting I S. foreign policy in
the changed world after Sept. 1 I," Diamond
said.
()ther I liter'national Relations courses relat
ed to Sept. 1 I include IR 111: "European Se
curity: NATO and EU from Cold War to Sept.
11"; IR 101: "Russia and Islam"; and the stu
dent-initiated IR 193A: "Understanding 9-1 1.
Its Causes, Contexts and (Consequences."
I he Political Science department is also of
fering a course largely oriented toward Sept.
11-related issues, PS 1S8: "International Secu
rity in a (Changing World," team-taught by Po
litical Science Prof. (oit Blacker, Management
Science and Engineering Prof. Michael May,
Management Science and Engineering Prof,
and former Defense Secretary William Peri)
and Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan.

Normally, the course features one or two
lec lures on terrorism, hut in the wake of the na
tional tragedy, terrorism will be given a much
greater emphasis.
"We've added a whole new section on ter
rorism and counter-terrorism featuring both
leading Stanford authorities and some special
outside lecturers such as Harvard's Louise
Richardson and [non-profit think tank]
RANIVs Bruc e I loffman," Sagan said.
Despite the numerous classes related to the
attacks and their aftermath, some I niversity
officials said the) believe student demand for
such courses is not being fiillv met.
"We need more classes," said Diamond.
"One problem is that when the courses are
seminars, professors . . . have to reject a num
ber of students who reallv wanted to and de
served to take the c lass."
Others have posed a contrasting question,
however.
"At what incremental point in the effort to
make a auricular response to events on that
day can we reasonably s.iv we have begun to
exaggerate their importance?" Kmmerson
rhetorically inquired.
Students certainly do not appear
to mind the course selection.
" There seems to Ik' a tremen
dous amount of student enthusi

asm," 1 )iamond said.
Sagan echoed this belief.
"VVe had over 200 students at
the first lecture this quarter, which
is larger than last year's enroll
ment." he said.
With such k<Vn interest iti topic s
closely lied to Sept. 11, the Universi
ty is likely to see an accompanying
rise in demand for Middle Kastern

Studies, a specialty that has tradi
tionally sullered from lac kol faculty.
"We just don't have enough fac
ulty in area studies and internation
al studies within the relevant de
partments," Diamond said.
In the view of some, however,
scholarly progress in Middle Kast
ern Studies at Stanford has not
been held back.

"In my view, Stanford, without a
Middle fast expert, ma\ produce
some of the finest Middle East
scholars of the next generation,"
Political Science Prof. David Liitin
told the Stanford Report.
But whether students are en
rolled in such courses to become a
scholar of the Middle East for only
to learn more about Sept. 11, Uni

versity officials s;iid they believe stu
dents will walk away with a better
insight on how such human
tragedies can be avoided.
"Sept. I 1 shocked us all, and
now the challenge will be toe hannel
our anger and fear into efforts to
learn more and design better strate
gies to prevent future attacks,"
Sagan said.

Students certainly do not appear
to mind the course selection.

Sagan echoed this belief.
"VVe had over 200 students at
the first lecture this quarter, which
is larger than last year's enroll
ment." he said.
With such k<Vn interest iti topic s
closely lied to Sept. 11, the Universi

Studies, a specialty that has tradi

"We just don't have enough fac
ulty in area studies and internation
al studies within the relevant de
partments," Diamond said.
In the view of some, however,
scholarly progress in Middle Kast
ern Studies at Stanford has not
been held back.

"In my view, Stanford, without a
Middle fast expert, ma\ produce
some of the finest Middle East
scholars of the next generation,"
Political Science Prof. David Liitin
told the Stanford Report.
But whether students are en
rolled in such courses to become a
scholar of the Middle East for only
to learn more about Sept. 11, Uni

versity officials s;iid they believe stu
dents will walk away with a better
insight on how such human
tragedies can be avoided.
"Sept. I 1 shocked us all, and
now the challenge will be toe hannel
our anger and fear into efforts to
learn more and design better strate
gies to prevent future attacks,"
Sagan said.
Four months follow ing the events of Sept.
I I, Stanford continues to offer a broad selec
tion of lectures and seminars that focus on
terrorism, international security and the Is
lamic world.
The Intel national Relations program is
sponsoring the majority of courses related to
the terrorist attacks and their aftermath this
quarter.
Prof Donald Etnmerson, a senior fellow at
the Institute lor International Studies, is teach
ing IR 121: "Beyond Jihad: Indonesia in Glob
al Perspective."'
"Students in IR 121 this quarter will explore
issues regarding Islam, globalization and
American policy with particular reference to
Indonesia," Kmmerson said.
Indonesia is a particularly relevant country
to examine for two reasons, Kmmerson said.
"More Muslims live in Indonesia than in any
other country," he said. "Additionally, news re
ports have suggested that Southeast Asia could
become the next front in America's anti-terror
ist campaign."

Students who would like to investigate
domestic concerns instead may be interest
ed in IR 194: "American foreign Polic\ after
Sept. I I
Larry Diamond, senior lellow at the I loover
Institution and a lecturer for the course, said
the class will look at American polio trade-offs
and implications.
"It is a series of thematic seminars to explore
challenges confronting I S. foreign policy in
the changed world after Sept. 1 I," Diamond
said.
()ther I liter'national Relations courses relat
ed to Sept. 1 I include IR 111: "European Se
curity: NATO and EU from Cold War to Sept.
11"; IR 101: "Russia and Islam"; and the stu
dent-initiated IR 193A: "Understanding 9-1 1.
Its Causes, Contexts and (Consequences."
I he Political Science department is also of
fering a course largely oriented toward Sept.
11-related issues, PS 1S8: "International Secu
rity in a (Changing World," team-taught by Po
litical Science Prof. (oit Blacker, Management
Science and Engineering Prof. Michael May,
Management Science and Engineering Prof,
and former Defense Secretary William Peri)
and Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan.

Normally, the course features one or two
lec lures on terrorism, hut in the wake of the na
tional tragedy, terrorism will be given a much
greater emphasis.
"We've added a whole new section on ter
rorism and counter-terrorism featuring both
leading Stanford authorities and some special
outside lecturers such as Harvard's Louise
Richardson and [non-profit think tank]
RANIVs Bruc e I loffman," Sagan said.
Despite the numerous classes related to the
attacks and their aftermath, some I niversity
officials said the) believe student demand for
such courses is not being fiillv met.
"We need more classes," said Diamond.
"One problem is that when the courses are
seminars, professors . . . have to reject a num
ber of students who reallv wanted to and de
served to take the c lass."
Others have posed a contrasting question,
however.
"At what incremental point in the effort to
make a auricular response to events on that
day can we reasonably s.iv we have begun to
exaggerate their importance?" Kmmerson
rhetorically inquired.
