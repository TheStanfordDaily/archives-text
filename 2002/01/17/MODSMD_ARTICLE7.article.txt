# Overseas student's ASSU senatorship comes under debate
## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A heated debate arose at Tuesday
night's ASSI Undergraduate Senate
meeting over whether senators should be
permitted to stud) abroad lor a quarter
and therefore miss one-third of their term.
Phe issue arose over the departure of
Advocacy Committee Co-Chair Petri
Mosqueda, a junior, to study in England
this quarter.
"She knew both sides of the coin," said
Senate Deputy, Chair Alex Shvartsman,
adding that he cautioned Mosqueda that
she could be removed.

Mosqueda
would like to
remain a sena
tor and contin-

ue participating in senate issues via e-mail
and speakerphone until she can return to
her post next quarter. Her right to vote,
however, would be suspended for this
quarter, according to Senate rules.
Mosqueda said she could still remain an
"involved senator" overseas by continuing
to work on items such as letters to admin
istrators, e-mails to students and finain ial
proposals.
"These are things that can very well be
done from overseas and that I plan to un

dertake throughout this quarter,"
Mosqueda said.
Past ASSI personnel have gone abroad
during their terms without comment from
the Senate. Current Budget and Finance
( bail (>abe Soledad, a senior, went abroad
fora quarter of his term last year.
Former ASSI Vice President Malia Vil
legas was studying in Washington, D.C.,
during her campaign and the first part of
her term.
"I definitely want to remain a senator
and feel that under standing precedent, I
should be able to do so," Mosqueda said.
I fowever, the ASSU bylaws state that .1
senator who misses three meetings must

be expelled from the body unless ,1 two
thirds majority votes to keep him or her
in office.
I lie ASSL Constitution, on the other
hand, notes that senators must have a two
thirds vote to remove a member.
Nominations Committee Chair Henry
I owsner, a junior, s;iic l that the bylaw,
while overridden by the Constitution, in
dicates that Senate attcndcncc is meant to
be important issue and subject to strict
penalties.
"Fall quarter . . . we made attendance
mandatory. That's something we ;ill com
mitted to," said senator Sonrisa Uuccro, a
junior. "Is going abroad an 'excused ab

sencer
"I don't know how someone can function
as a senator abroad." Lucero continued.
"You have to be in touch with students."
ASSI Vice President Christine
Corclero, a senior, was firm in her assess
ment of the debate. "No matter how much
we all love I erri. you shouldn't go
[abroad]," she said. "No excuses, that's the
bottom line."
Student I.ife Chair Nick Rodriguez
passionate!) defended Moscjueda's right
to remain a senator, noting that she had

done great work, would still be
needed when she returned and
should not be removed alter she
had already left to go overseas.
Senator Ho (Cowgill, ;i junior,
noted that as .ill the senate's meet
ings are open, Vlosqueda could
still contribute feedback via e-mail
«incl read meeting minutes online.
Appointing a substitute senator
would be illegal under ASSL' rules,
and an election to till missing scats
c annot be lie-Id until a greater num
ber of senators leave their posts.
"I'm hesitant to build in per
mission to leave," said ASSL Pres
ident Matt Brewer, a junior. "We
are voted in fora lull term."
lowsner added, "II someone
isn't really committed to the job, it
should discourage them from

running in the first place."
However, Rodriguez noted
that overseas campuses were still
Stanford campuses; senators
abroad would st ill be representing
Stanford students.
Finally, I )ire< tor of Student Ac
tivities Nanci Howe said that pre
venting senators from going
abroad during their terms may
hinder student voice.
"A lot of students go abroad,"
1 lowe said. "W ill this policy cause
juniors not to run lor the senate?"
"You have three other years to
do it," (Corderocountered.
Senator Katie Founds, a sopho
more, proposed, "How about we
don't kick Terri off, and we just
put something in the handbook
lor the future?"
I he final dec ision is slated for
next week's meeting to allow sen
ators to consider the matter, ex
amine appropriate by-laws and
consult with Mosqueda herself.

permitted to stud) abroad lor a quarter
and therefore miss one-third of their term.
Phe issue arose over the departure of
Advocacy Committee Co-Chair Petri
Mosqueda, a junior, to study in England
this quarter.
"She knew both sides of the coin," said
Senate Deputy, Chair Alex Shvartsman,
adding that he cautioned Mosqueda that
she could be removed.

Mosqueda
would like to
remain a sena
tor and contin-

ue participating in senate issues via e-mail
and speakerphone until she can return to
her post next quarter. Her right to vote,
however, would be suspended for this
quarter, according to Senate rules.
Mosqueda said she could still remain an
"involved senator" overseas by continuing
to work on items such as letters to admin
istrators, e-mails to students and finain ial
proposals.
"These are things that can very well be
done from overseas and that I plan to un

dertake throughout this quarter,"
Mosqueda said.
Past ASSI personnel have gone abroad
during their terms without comment from
the Senate. Current Budget and Finance
( bail (>abe Soledad, a senior, went abroad
fora quarter of his term last year.
Former ASSI Vice President Malia Vil
legas was studying in Washington, D.C.,
during her campaign and the first part of
her term.
"I definitely want to remain a senator
and feel that under standing precedent, I
should be able to do so," Mosqueda said.
I fowever, the ASSU bylaws state that .1
senator who misses three meetings must

be expelled from the body unless ,1 two
thirds majority votes to keep him or her
in office.
I lie ASSL Constitution, on the other
hand, notes that senators must have a two
thirds vote to remove a member.
Nominations Committee Chair Henry
I owsner, a junior, s;iic l that the bylaw,
while overridden by the Constitution, in
dicates that Senate attcndcncc is meant to
be important issue and subject to strict
penalties.
"Fall quarter . . . we made attendance
mandatory. That's something we ;ill com
mitted to," said senator Sonrisa Uuccro, a
junior. "Is going abroad an 'excused ab

sencer
"I don't know how someone can function
as a senator abroad." Lucero continued.
"You have to be in touch with students."
ASSI Vice President Christine
Corclero, a senior, was firm in her assess
ment of the debate. "No matter how much
we all love I erri. you shouldn't go
[abroad]," she said. "No excuses, that's the
bottom line."
Student I.ife Chair Nick Rodriguez
passionate!) defended Moscjueda's right
to remain a senator, noting that she had

done great work, would still be
needed when she returned and
should not be removed alter she
had already left to go overseas.
Senator Ho (Cowgill, ;i junior,
noted that as .ill the senate's meet
ings are open, Vlosqueda could
still contribute feedback via e-mail
«incl read meeting minutes online.
Appointing a substitute senator
would be illegal under ASSL' rules,
and an election to till missing scats
c annot be lie-Id until a greater num
ber of senators leave their posts.
"I'm hesitant to build in per
mission to leave," said ASSL Pres
ident Matt Brewer, a junior. "We
are voted in fora lull term."
lowsner added, "II someone
isn't really committed to the job, it
should discourage them from

running in the first place."
However, Rodriguez noted
that overseas campuses were still
Stanford campuses; senators
abroad would st ill be representing
Stanford students.
Finally, I )ire< tor of Student Ac
tivities Nanci Howe said that pre
venting senators from going
abroad during their terms may
hinder student voice.
"A lot of students go abroad,"
1 lowe said. "W ill this policy cause
juniors not to run lor the senate?"
"You have three other years to
do it," (Corderocountered.
Senator Katie Founds, a sopho
more, proposed, "How about we
don't kick Terri off, and we just
put something in the handbook
lor the future?"
I he final dec ision is slated for
next week's meeting to allow sen
ators to consider the matter, ex
amine appropriate by-laws and
consult with Mosqueda herself.
