## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A heated debate arose at Tuesday
night's ASSI Undergraduate Senate
meeting over whether senators should be
permitted to stud) abroad lor a quarter
and therefore miss one-third of their term.
Phe issue arose over the departure of
Advocacy Committee Co-Chair Petri
Mosqueda, a junior, to study in England
this quarter.
"She knew both sides of the coin," said
Senate Deputy, Chair Alex Shvartsman,
adding that he cautioned Mosqueda that
she could be removed.

Mosqueda
would like to
remain a sena
tor and contin-

ue participating in senate issues via e-mail
and speakerphone until she can return to
her post next quarter. Her right to vote,
however, would be suspended for this
quarter, according to Senate rules.
Mosqueda said she could still remain an
"involved senator" overseas by continuing
to work on items such as letters to admin
istrators, e-mails to students and finain ial
proposals.
"These are things that can very well be
done from overseas and that I plan to un

dertake throughout this quarter,"
Mosqueda said.
Past ASSI personnel have gone abroad
during their terms without comment from
the Senate. Current Budget and Finance

Former ASSI Vice President Malia Vil
legas was studying in Washington, D.C.,
during her campaign and the first part of
her term.

and feel that under standing precedent, I
should be able to do so," Mosqueda said.

senator who misses three meetings must

be expelled from the body unless ,1 two
thirds majority votes to keep him or her
in office.
I lie ASSL Constitution, on the other
hand, notes that senators must have a two
thirds vote to remove a member.
Nominations Committee Chair Henry
I owsner, a junior, s;iic l that the bylaw,
while overridden by the Constitution, in
dicates that Senate attcndcncc is meant to

penalties.
"Fall quarter . . . we made attendance
mandatory. That's something we ;ill com
mitted to," said senator Sonrisa Uuccro, a
junior. "Is going abroad an 'excused ab

sencer
"I don't know how someone can function
as a senator abroad." Lucero continued.
"You have to be in touch with students."
ASSI Vice President Christine
Corclero, a senior, was firm in her assess

we all love I erri. you shouldn't go
[abroad]," she said. "No excuses, that's the
