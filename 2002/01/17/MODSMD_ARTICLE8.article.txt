I)<K's tin- name Buckminster Fuller ringa Ix'll?
I'erhaps it's Ijecauscyc>u studied the Fullerenc
molecule, more affectionately known as the
"Buckyball," in ;i biology or chemistry class. ()r
maybe you've seen Fuller s famous invention, the
geodesic dome.
Scholarly views on Fuller — an inventor, en
gineer, architect and cosmologist, among other
things — range from 11 iti< ;il to reverent. Now,
Stanford students< uriousabout the life and work
of Fuller, called "Bucky" by friends, will have the
chance to learn more about the man.
The Stanford Humanities laboratory and
University I .ibrariesare holding a series of events
this quarter to mark the recent acquisition of the
Buckminster Fuller An hives.

"With a person as brilliant and eccentric as
Fuller, the tendency is to adulation or outright
rejection," said Jeffrey Schnapp, direc tor of the
Stanford I lumanities I aboratoty.
I here are three components to the series of
events.
First, a seminar jointly sponsored by Stanford
Libra ties and the Stanford Humanities I-ab fo
<uses on Fuller and his work. The seminar, of
fered this quarter, will give students the opportu
nity to perform hands-on arc hival work.
Second, a seriesoP'conversations" .ilxxit Fuller
will Ik- held at the Biug Wing of (ireen Library.
Seating will be by reservation only and the conver
sations will have a personal, intimate setting, and
will Ik- taped for television distribution.
"We want them to Ik- more like ()prah Win
frey than gladiatorial combat," S< hnapp said.
Hie first conversation took place yesterday

evening with Shoji Sadao, an architect who
worked with Fuller on many projects including
the l ( .)f>7 Expo Dome in Montreal.

will soon be accessible through
(ireen library, as a special resource
for " a new generation of re
searchers." Hie events this quarter
were planned to help draw atten
tion to the archives.
"The motivation was to welcome
the Fuller Art hives to <i new home.
It's very important not to let the
event pass unmarked and unno
ticed," Schnapp said.
Fuller was a figure who em
braced l)oth the "techie" and "fii//v
cultures. Schnapp said he is interest
ed in the spillover between cultural

history and that ol'sc icncc and te< h
nology that can Ik- seen in Fuller.
"Fuller developed his career fill
ing in the gap between what [au
thor] (1. P. Snow < ailed the' Iwo C ail
tures,' s< lence and the humanities,"
Schnapp said.
Fuller was particularly popular
with the progressive movements of
the I'MiOsand 19705.
I o S< hnapp, Fullet is a prodiu t
of his generation. While Fuller was
correct in many of his views .ilk>iit
the future, he was completely wrong
in others.
"To what degree is his work anti
quated and how much is prophetic?
He gets some things remarkably
right and other things seem quaint
and ill informed," S< hnapp said.
