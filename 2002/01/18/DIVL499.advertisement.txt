"Being a PHE is unique to every other experience at Stanford. The chance to
help people make healthy choices is so valuable.
I am so glad I have gotten this opportunity!"
- Christina Williams, Otero PHE
"Becoming a Peer Health Educator is the best thing I have ever done at
Stanford. The relationships that I enjoy with my residents and co-staff have
been far more rewarding than I had ever even imagined possible."
- Nina Sung, Junipero PHE
doing one of my first workshops, one of my freshman residents told me
that it was the best hour he's spent since he's been here at Stanford. It totally
made my day, and made all the hours planning for such a program worth it."
- Ann Ha, Naranja PHE
"Being a PHE is like being a BMW; it's about bringing a balance of safety,
relaxation, and fun into people's lives."
- Allison Lewis, Mirrielees PHE
This is why some of this year's PHEs have loved their job.
