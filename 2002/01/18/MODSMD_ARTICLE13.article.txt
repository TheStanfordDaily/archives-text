## The
						Stanford Daily ASSU should keep Mosqueda, establish policy 
### 
Published Since 1891

In their Tuesday night meeting, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate debat
ed the question of whether one of
their senators, Advocacy Committee
Co-Chair Terri Mosqueda, a junior, should
be able to retain her senatorship while
studying abroad this quarter. Some argued
that being absent for one-third of one's
term — and in the process violating ASSU
bylaws as well as the mandatory attendance
policy instated by the Senate this fall — is
grounds for dismissal from the Senate.
Others lobbied for Mosqueda s retention,
explaining that she would still be repre
senting students and would be able to stay

in contact via conference calls and e-mail
from an overseas campus.
We feel that the former argument is far
stronger; ASSU senators should not be
permitted to go abroad while in office.
Serving on the Senate is a privilege and a
responsibility that should not be taken
lightly, and one that could not be ade
quately handled by e-mails and phone calls
only. The competition for spaces in the
Senate is so great that, once elected, repre
sentatives should make their job their pri
ority. The ASSU's mandatory attendance
policy was enacted in order to reinforce
this sense of priority.

This is not to say in any way that Stan
lord students should be discouraged from
studying overseas. However, time away
from Stanford should be taken when a stu
dent is free from serious leadership re
sponsibilities. Resident assistants can not
be abroad fora quarter, nor should com
mittee heads, or other elected representa
tives from prominent student groups.
In the case of this particular senator,
though, we feel she should be allowed to
remain on the Senate. The ASSU Constitu
tion and bylaws send conflicting messages
on how this situation should be handled,
and there is no stated policy on senators

going abroad during their term. Especially
given that there was a senator who went
overseas last year and was allowed to retain
his position, to remove Mosqueda from the
Senate after she has already left Stanford
for the quarter would not be fair.
Obviously the ASSU needs to use this op
portunity to set a clear policy in place for
the future. The Senate should act quickly
to establish a firm position on the question
of study abroad, publicize it widely and en
sure that those running for office in the fu
ture are aware of the commitment — which
includes remaining on campus — they will
undertake should they be elected.
