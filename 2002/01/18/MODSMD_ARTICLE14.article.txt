# TWO GUYS WHO ARE BETTER THAN YOU

### 
Doug is One of My Best Friends
Dear Mow,
I can still remember the clay when my freshman
year RA said, on the first night at Stanford, that we
would meet people here who we'd invite to our
75th wedding anniversary.
He was right: I've met some great people at this
school and I thought it would be nice to tell you more
about someone you probably know: Doug, the co-writer
ol our newspaper column. I Its a great guy and one of
my best friends.
We were in the same ch aw group last year and ended
up being roommates, which is cool. It makes it easy to
make the "jokes" about us wasting away in our chairs, too.
1 le'ssuchacool roommate. ()ncein awhile, late at night,
he'll l<x k me out and then tell me to "leave for 20 or 30 min
utes.' I hen he runs to his computer and does something.
I m not really sure what that's all about, but usually we just
c rack jokes and tr\ to trick people; to visit our room.
Even though people make fun of this, we talk on IM
sometimes even though we sit right next to each other. I
put some of our funniest conversations on my Web site:
http: www Stanford. edu/~ramit. One time, Doug sent
me a lewd e-mail that was hilarious, so I posted it to my
site. I le told me that I "better take off that e-mail from
the Web site or else face the pain of a thousand suns."
I laha, what a kidder!
I was trying to think of a story to describe what a cool
gu\ Doug is. I guess the only thing is that 1 asked Doug
to pic k me up from the airport a couple weeks ago and,
ol < ourse, he said he would. That was nice of him. After
my flight, I was waiting outside my terminal forawhile,
probably about an hour oi two, and then it started to
rain. I went inside the airport and fell asleep and real
ized I had missed my ride home! So I took a cab and,
when I walked into our room, Doug was sitting there
watching I V and eating pret/els. "Hey," he said, "when
did you get back?" I thought that was pretty funny and
reminded him how he had probably come to pick me up
;it 11 ic* airport. "()hh.. .1 sort of sat down to watch a show,
and then the Simpsons came on, and you know how I
love that show . . ." I guess I can understand how he just
decided not to pick me up. I mean, the Simpsons is a
pretty funny show .
Any way , it's fun having Doug as a roommate and co
columnist. I think I have a fun weekend ahead of me.
Doug told me if I do his laundry, he won't point out my
bottle of lotion every time a girl walks in the room. What
a great guv.
Im>e,
Rain it

I Hate Ramit So Much
Dear Da (I,
Holy Christ, I can't take it anymore.
It's a couple weeks into the new quarter now,
and everything's going fine except for one
thing. The other night on the phone, you
wanted me to tell you a little more about Ramit, since he
co-authors the column with me.
Well, last year we were in the same Draw group and
ended up being roommates. I had thought it would be
cool, but I had no idea living with the guy 2-4 / 7 would
be so awful. For instance, he keeps throwing "jokes"
into the column about how he only leaves his chair to
sleep and eat. I thought he was kidding at first, but it's
true! I he guy's ALWAYS there. I think he just sits and
tinkers with his Web site, which, by tlie* way, he
NEVER STOPS TALKING ABOUT. I try to avoid
startingconversations with him for fear he'll go on and
on about the latest link he put up. Also, he's always lis
tening to music on the IS speakers he has around the
room. If it were good music, I could handle it. But he
only plays all this goddamn Boy/ II Men-type crap. He
says it's "teaching him to be smooth with the ladies." I
wonder how the large, pink bottle of lotion of his desk
fits in with that.
But let s be serious, this 90-pound recluse is never
going to get a date. I mean, most girls outweigh him by
20 pounds, well the pretty ones at least. Remember
that picture of the bulimic Ethiopian kid I showed
you? I hat kid could beat Ramit's ass like his father
never did.
Another thing, writing this column with him is killing
me. He gets so excited over every terrible idea he pro
poses, and I'm not sure if I can handle print ing this crap
much longer. Just to give you an example of all that I'm
dealing with, Ramit has this tiara he loves. Don't ask me
why, but he worships the thing, 112 le even has a little table
as the "Official Resting Place ofthe Great Tiara." At first
it was kind of funny to watch him prance around the
hallways wearing it, but then it got annoying. So I found
a piece of PVC pipe and smashed it into little pieces.
Now all Ramit does is sit in the corner and cry. I'm not
really sure what to do about it. I don't have to listen to his
music anymore, but I'm starting to worry a little. I mean,
could his family sue me or anything?
Thanks for any advice you can give.
Love,
Done
