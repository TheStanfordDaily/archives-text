Training table 'an atrocity'
Stern Dining recently introduced an atrocity
called 'The Training Table." This "table" is an
area in the cafeteria strictly reserved for athletes.
Apparently, the Athletic Department has decided
to subsidize higher quality food for its students
whit h in itself seems unfair to those of us who pay
tuition-hut when flaunted in front of students who
are not allowed to partake of the meals, it is bla
tantly disrespectful and cruel.
For example, one of Stern's normal-folk spe
cialties is called "flap meat." While 1 understand
that it would make our dining plans impossibly ex
pensive for the masses to have more than prison
grade beef, it makes the reality all the worse when
juicy steaks for athletes are served right next to it.
II the Athletic Department is going to flaunt its
money in front ofother students, it should pay for
better meals for everyone. If not, keep the "Train
ing Table" in Arrillaga, where at least we don't
have to see it, and the rest of us can try to forget
that we don't get free medical, free massages, free
tuition, and a quarterly stipend. There are a lot of
students at this school on financial aid, who have
taken out absurd amounts of loans to pay for their
educations and their meal plans.
How does the bureaucracy think these students
feel when they see their athletic friends right next to
them, eating haute-( uisine while they are making do
with grainy apples and it-almost-looks-like-chicken?
Why has Stanford Dining adopted a c aste system?
I realize that this letter has been a rampage,
and I wish to add that this issue needs to be taken
up with the heads of Dining Services and the
Athletic Department, and not with student ath
letes. I know they are not at fault, and I don't
mean to attack the athletes because they work
very hard. Nonetheless, on this campus, so does
everyone-and since we work equally hard we

should be fed equally well.

Berkeley student criticizes Stull piece
I love that [ Jonathan Stull] can't even mention
the loss to Berkeley in his column.
It lets me know that you sheltered smarty-pants
are really hurting for that one. Makes me feel all
warm and fuzzy inside.
I hanks for that.
P.S.: Sweet 16? With a bunch of pretty boy
wussiesr' Casey will be crying again. That's a
prediction.
