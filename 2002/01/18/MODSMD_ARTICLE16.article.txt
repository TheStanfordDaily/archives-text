Training table 'an atrocity'
Stern Dining recently introduced an atrocity
called 'The Training Table." This "table" is an
area in the cafeteria strictly reserved for athletes.
Apparently, the Athletic Department has decided
to subsidize higher quality food for its students
whit h in itself seems unfair to those of us who pay
tuition-hut when flaunted in front of students who
are not allowed to partake of the meals, it is bla
tantly disrespectful and cruel.
For example, one of Stern's normal-folk spe
cialties is called "flap meat." While 1 understand
that it would make our dining plans impossibly ex
pensive for the masses to have more than prison
grade beef, it makes the reality all the worse when
juicy steaks for athletes are served right next to it.
II the Athletic Department is going to flaunt its
money in front ofother students, it should pay for
better meals for everyone. If not, keep the "Train
ing Table" in Arrillaga, where at least we don't
have to see it, and the rest of us can try to forget
that we don't get free medical, free massages, free
tuition, and a quarterly stipend. There are a lot of
students at this school on financial aid, who have
taken out absurd amounts of loans to pay for their
educations and their meal plans.
How does the bureaucracy think these students
feel when they see their athletic friends right next to
them, eating haute-( uisine while they are making do
with grainy apples and it-almost-looks-like-chicken?
Why has Stanford Dining adopted a c aste system?
I realize that this letter has been a rampage,
and I wish to add that this issue needs to be taken
up with the heads of Dining Services and the
Athletic Department, and not with student ath
letes. I know they are not at fault, and I don't
mean to attack the athletes because they work
very hard. Nonetheless, on this campus, so does
everyone-and since we work equally hard we

should be fed equally well.

Berkeley student criticizes Stull piece
I love that [ Jonathan Stull] can't even mention
the loss to Berkeley in his column.
It lets me know that you sheltered smarty-pants
are really hurting for that one. Makes me feel all
warm and fuzzy inside.
I hanks for that.
P.S.: Sweet 16? With a bunch of pretty boy
wussiesr' Casey will be crying again. That's a
prediction.

Algorithmic, Darwinian differences
There are genuine discrepancies be
tween Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) and
Darwinian evolutionary processes:
1. In EA, a long-range goal is usually
pre-specified. In evolution, changes take
place with no forethought to the eventual
needs of the living organism. Natural se
lection then acts on the beneficial changes
till they take over the population and elim
inates other changes.
2. In nature, mutation can take place
through tht- substitution of one nitroge
nous base in the DNA sequence by anoth
er during replication. The copying opera
tion is a high fidelity process followed by

proofreading to reduce copying error to
about one in one or ten billion (the error
rate depends on the organism), in EA
much higher rates are used and ilms the
speed of EA can be misleading. Even if
throughout natural evolution the muta
tion rate was high at tlu* beginning and
then was adaptively decreased by some
mechanism, it could not have been so
high, as it would then have severely dis
rupted the existing genomes.
3. A useless or harmful mutation in a
numerical chromosome can be easily re
moved from the set of potential solutions
with no complications.
On the other hand, a change in one ni
trogenous base can cause a change in one
amino acid in the protein coded by the gene
rendering it un-functional or even lethal.
4. Even if the natural mutation is bene
ficial, it can be wiped out before the or
ganism has a chance of reproducing and
transferring its traits to its offspring. 1 n EA

there are no (amines, droughts, floods,
fires or other species preying on the po
tential solutions.
"). J he mutations must also happen in
active, not junk, UNA and be reflected in
the phenotype in order to give the organ
ism a selective advantage.
0. In EA many new operators are used
that do not have counterparts in natural
evolution. These operators were devised
to enhance the speed and performance
of HA.
7. HA does not give insights into the
evolution of the crossover operation itsell
in nature. Ihe natural concept is bor
rowed and then modified according to the
problem tackled In KA. In short, the suc
cess of KA cannot be used to infer the cor
rectness of Darwinian evolution and in
fact it can highlight some of the theory's
flaws.
