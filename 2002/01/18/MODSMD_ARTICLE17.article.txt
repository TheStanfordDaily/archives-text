In a world of uncertainty, its
nice that there's always some
thing you can count on.
Well, nice for Stanford, not so
nice for Washington Suite.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford
104, Washington State 57

The No. 4 Stanford women's
basketball team improved to 7-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference after
defeating the Cougars (2-16,0-8)
104-57 in a futile David vs. Go
liath match.
The win put Stanford 33-0
all-time against Washington
State, dating back to 1983. The
game marked the third time
this season the team has hit the
century mark.
Though the Cougars entered
the game without a conference
win, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer was willing to give
Washington the benefit of the
doubt in a press conference ear
lier this week.
"It's tough," VanDerveer
said. "We know we need to play
well on the road and everyone's
played well against us. The com
petition in the Pac-10 is some
thing we need to be ready for."
While all that is true, the

Clou gars were completely unpre
pared for the assault Stanford
would launch on them.
In a game that saw the Cardi
nal dominate, it was the seniors
who shined the brightest.
All five of the team's seniors
scored in the game and four
reached double digits.
Leading the Stanford offense
was senior center Cori En
ghusen, who scored a career
high 24 points. Knghusen shot
an impressive 11-15 from the
floor. She added to her numbers
by collecting four boards and
dishing out an assist.
This game marked a new
level to F.nghusen's pla\. After a
successful summer playing
overseas at the World Universi
ty Games, Knghusen has been
waiting to showcase her talent
like this all season.
The Seattle native finished
off the night by taking the ball
inside and converting on a
three-point play to finish the
scoring at 104 points.
Senior forward Bethany
Donaphin and senioi guard Kn
joli l/.idor both finished with 13
points and six rebounds on the
night, while senior guard l.ind
sey Yamasaki left with 14 points
of her own.

With 14 points and six assists, senior Lindsey Yamasaki displayed the
same type of consistent play that has allowed the Cardinal to improve to
7-0 in the Pac-10 conference.
from its freshman forward Azella
Perryman.
Ferryman recorded her first
double-double of the season with
10 points and 13 boards, both sea
son highs. Perryman, making her
1 7th appearance off the bench this
season, knocked in an inside shot
to put the Cardinal over the 100-
mark.
Also scoring for Stanford were
sophomore guard Katie Denny
and freshman forward T'Nae
Fhiel with eight apiece.
Senior guard Lauren St. ('.lair
and freshman guard Kelley Sum
inski put in five of their own and
sophomore forward Nicole Powell
finished with four points, five re
bounds and 10 assists.
Powell, who on Monday was an
nounced as the Pac-10 Player of
the Week for the third time this
season, sat down to enjoy the rest
of the game with more than 10
minutes left to play.

Powell broke the school-re
bounding record last week when
she pulled down 21 boards against
Oregon on Sunday. The old
record of 20 had stood since 1977.
I he score was 62-26 when Van-
Derveer decided to give her talent
ed bench some substantial min
utes. With this decision, the team
continued to prove that regardless
of which combination used, the
game kept rolling.
Stanford finished strong by
shooting 42 of 68 for the game, in
cluding <S of 17 from behind the
three-point line.
The squad also tallied 35 assists
in the game. Stanford leads (he
l'ac-10 in (he team-assist category
and prior to tonight's game, had
been averaging 19.29 per game.
After tonight s impressive per
formance, (he Cardinal must trav
el to Seattle and be ready fora
more challenging matchup
against Washington.
I he I luskies are 4-3 in the Pac
-10 and 6-2 on their home floor and
(hough the Cardinal leads the se
ries 12-3 dating back to 1994, it has
dropped the last two.

However, with an eighth con
secutive conference win on the
line, the Cardinal will have more
(han enough motivation to go into
the Bank of American Arena and
snap iis losing streak against (he
I luskies.
