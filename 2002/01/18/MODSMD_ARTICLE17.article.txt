In a world of uncertainty, its
nice that there's always some
thing you can count on.
Well, nice for Stanford, not so
nice for Washington Suite.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford
104, Washington State 57

The No. 4 Stanford women's
basketball team improved to 7-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference after
defeating the Cougars (2-16,0-8)
104-57 in a futile David vs. Go
liath match.
The win put Stanford 33-0
all-time against Washington
State, dating back to 1983. The
game marked the third time
this season the team has hit the
century mark.
Though the Cougars entered
the game without a conference
win, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer was willing to give
Washington the benefit of the
doubt in a press conference ear
lier this week.
"It's tough," VanDerveer
said. "We know we need to play
well on the road and everyone's
played well against us. The com
petition in the Pac-10 is some
thing we need to be ready for."
While all that is true, the

Clou gars were completely unpre
pared for the assault Stanford
would launch on them.
In a game that saw the Cardi
nal dominate, it was the seniors
who shined the brightest.
All five of the team's seniors
scored in the game and four
reached double digits.
Leading the Stanford offense
was senior center Cori En
ghusen, who scored a career
high 24 points. Knghusen shot
an impressive 11-15 from the
floor. She added to her numbers
by collecting four boards and
dishing out an assist.
This game marked a new
level to F.nghusen's pla\. After a
successful summer playing
overseas at the World Universi
ty Games, Knghusen has been
waiting to showcase her talent
like this all season.
The Seattle native finished
off the night by taking the ball
inside and converting on a
three-point play to finish the
scoring at 104 points.
Senior forward Bethany
Donaphin and senioi guard Kn
joli l/.idor both finished with 13
points and six rebounds on the
night, while senior guard l.ind
sey Yamasaki left with 14 points
of her own.

same type of consistent play that has allowed the Cardinal to improve to
7-0 in the Pac-10 conference.
