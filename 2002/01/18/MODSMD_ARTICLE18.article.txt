# Davis and Johnson both show up to play

### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
All you can really say after
Stanford's game against Wash
ington State is "finally."
Finally, Casey Jacobsen gets to
come out of the first half, not be
cause of foul trouble, but to give
sophomore Matt Lottich a
chance to get involved.
Finally, an inside-outside
attack.
Finally, some scoring balance.
And probably the biggest story
line of the night — finally, Justin
Davis and Teyo Johnson
reemerge as viable offensive op
tions on this team.
Needless to say, there was a
much more consistent quality in
the air at Maples Pavilion. Players
and fans alike can breathe a sigh
of relief— there would be no un
warranted upsets tonight.
The beginning of the game
looked to be an offensive (linic by
Jacobsen and Curtis Borchardt.
But it wasn't long before the
rest of the Stanford bent h, specif
ically the Stanford big men, got
involved.
The Cardinal has been
plagued by inconsistencies on
the offensive end — players
putting up unbelievable num
bers one night and barely find

ing their way back to the stat
sheet the next.
Obviously, when Davis and
Johnson can find a way to score, it
takes some of the storing pres
sure off Jacobsen and Borchardt.
But it's the morale-lifting
style with which the two big
men score that really gets the
crowd going.
"I liked how Teyo and Justin
got out and ran the floor," Jacob
sen said. "We haven't done that
enough lately, but it makes things
so much easier on everyone and
it really gets the crowd going."
Davis was 4-4 from the field
for nine points and kept the Sixth
Man Club entertained as he
showed off his high-flying act
with two spectacular dunks.
"I think the big men played re
ally well, especially Justin Davis,"
said sophomore guard Matt Lot
tich. "Justin really came to play.
He was really focused and he
showed that all week in prat tit e."
If it hasn't been said before
(and it has), there is no doubt that
Davis oozes athleticism. Ihe
question is whether or not he can
figure out how to temper his ath
letic explosiveness down to mesh
well with this traditionally dis< i
plined offensive team.
Spectators saw a glimpse last
night of how Davis' raw talent

and hustle can be an asset.
"I think everybody got an op
portunity to put some points on
t he board, whit Iv is always
good," Davis said. "I personally
don't realh complain much, but
it always feels good to get a lew
passes so that I can knock some
shots down."
Johnson, ;i sophomore, also
showed (lashes <>l his youthful
freshman days, tailing confi
dently for the ball in the low
block and spotting up for the
three without hesitation.
"I think (ioach has a lot more
trust in me," Johnson said. "In
the beginning of the season he
would put me in as a defensive
stopper but now I think lie's look
ing to me more offensively."
Last night, Johnson had his
best showing to date. I le finished
with nine points off the bench,
but most important!) he looked a

lot more comfortable on the of
fensive entl. It seems like lie's li
nallv getting his legs back.
fhe question on the minds of
all Sixth Club members was, "Is
he back?"
"1 think I played consistently,"
Johnson saitl humbly. "But I'm
not playing to my lull ability yet."
After missing a lay-up early
in the first half, Jacobsen
showed his confidence in John
son by going right back to him
on the next play, which letl to a
Johnson score. I he pass proba
bly didn't mean that much to
(lasey, but it tlitl a lot for the of
fensive rhythm and for the con
fidence of feyo.
Km it wasn't just Johnson and
I )avis who contributed down low.
I here was a solid effort by a
whole slew of Stanford post play
