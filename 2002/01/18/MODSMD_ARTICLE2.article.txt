# Panel advises reproductive cloning ban
## Report drafted by Law School prof Hank Greely also supports allowing human therapeutic cloning 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a report authored by I*iw School Prof. Hank
Greely, the (California Advisor) (Committee on Human
(Cloning unanimously recommended last week that
while the suite should ban human reproductive cloning,
it should not prohibit human therapeutic cloning.
Endorsing a ban of reproductive cloning, the com
mittee reported that "many arguments support this po
sition, some dealing with physical and psychological
safety, some with ethical or social concerns and some
with regulator) and political issues."
(Jreely, a member of the committee, explained, "All
12 of us felt that the safet) issues with reproductive
cloning were compelling."
fo support its recommendation that therapeutic
non-reproductive cloning — such as embryonic stem
cell research — be permitted, the committee said it be
lieves that the "use of this technology offers potential
medical and scientific benefits while not raising many of
the same concerns as human reproductive cloning."
Asa part of its recommendation foi allowing human
non-reproductive cloning, the committee said (Califor
nia should regulate all such procedures.
"We urged that non-reproductive cloning be per
mitted but regulated, whether done with public or pri
vate funding, in three ways," Greely explained. "Ensur
ing that donors of all cells used in the process gave in
formed consent; prohibiting the use of pre-embryos
after development of the primitive streak, which hap
pens at about day 14; and requit ing that each protocol
for non-reproductive human cloning research be ap
proved by an authorized Institutional Review Board."
I he other three recommendations unanimously
made by the committee were that actions of the feder
al government and other states be watched carefully;
that the ( California legislature define the terms of its
prohibition on human reproductive cloning carefully
and its regulation of therapeutic cloning carefully but
broadly; and that (California establish an on-going
mechanism to advise the governor and legislature on
issues of human biotechnology.
The panel was appointed in 1997, when the state
adopted a five-year ban on human reproductive
cloning, to provide advice to the governor and legisla
ture about what to do when the five years had ended.
Made up of 12 (Californians from a wide range of
backgrounds and expertise, the
group lias studied human cloning
issues for the past two years. It held
five public meetings throughout
(California, at which its members
heard testimonv from international
experts and comments from ordi
nary (Califbrnians.
On Jan. 1">, the committee's re
port was the sole topic of discus
sion at a state Senate committee
hearing. According to Greely, the
members of the committee spoke,
four state senators listened and

then asked questions, and seven or
eight members of the audience
made comments.
"In general, I'd say our recom
mendations were well-received
[with the exception of] one senator
and two audience members dis
agreeing with our non-reproduc
tive cloning recommendation be
cause of the destruction of pre-em
bryos," (C reefy said.
I he committee's report has
"given the legislature and the gov
ernor an excellent discussion ol the
science and ethical issues, a very
good set of proposed recommenda
tions and enough time to make use
of both before the existing law ex
pires on Jan. 1,2003," Greely said.
