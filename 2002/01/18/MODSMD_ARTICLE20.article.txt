# Stanford shoots its way back on track

### AARON LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
For one night, they played like
they meant it.
All of them did.
Not just Casey, and not just
Curtis.
All of them.
l'hey moved without the ball.
They followed their shots. They
wanted it bad.
Sure, Stanford's 83-50 victory
Thursday night at Maples Pavilion
was over a Washington State team
that has now lost its last nine
games. But it was a confidence
booster nonetheless.
"We needed a game like this, to
get everyone involved, everyone
scoring points and to make us feel
good about ourselves," said junior
Casey Jacobsen, who finished with
15 points and six assists. "Fvery
win is a good win for us."
Frankly, this wasn't the same
team that played in the losses to
(California and ()regon.
l itis team was fiercer. It was
stronger. And it was tougher.
The offense wasn't stagnant like
it had been lately. I he passes were
quicker and the movement was
faster. ()l the (Cardinal's 3 I field
goals, 24 of them were assisted. 12
of the 13 playeis finished with at
least one assist.

points. Forwards Justin Davis and
Teyo Johnson had nine each.
Sophomore Malt Lottich
scored six points and Rob Little
had seven.
From tlieopening tipofl, the in
tensity was high. Junior Julius
Barnes took a misplayed ball the
length of the court and drew a
foul. A Jacobsen three-pointer,
three field goals by Borehardt and
two steals later, the C Cardinal had a
16-6 lead.
"We started doing what we've
talked about doing, and that's
coming out and playing hard from
the beginning," Davis said.
No. 19 Stanford (10-4, 3-2 Pa
cific 10 Conference) finished the
night shooting 50 percent from
the field.
"On this team, we're capable
one through 15," said senior point
guard Tony Ciovacchini. "You
don't get onto this team and play if
you can't score. When you get on
the break like that, a lot more guys
are going to score."
The defense played the in
your-face type of basketball that
hadn't been there in a while. Davis

After a stretch of inconsistent play, junior Casey Jacobsen and his teammates
finally showed a shade of the form that the team possessed in last year's run
in the NCAA Tournament.
two steals. 1 hen, alter bringing the
( row'd to its feet with two consecu
tive si.tins, he broke up a pass and
fed it to Barnes, whose lay-up gave
the Cardinal a 52-32 lead with
1 5: 10 to play.
"The [defenseJ was big," Davis
said. "II we tan get out there and
pressure people w hen the clock is
down, its going to shake them up
a littlt* bit and tlit* advantage is
going to be on our side."
1 he Cardinal finished with 10
steals, and held the (Cougars (4-1 1,
0-7) to 35.7 percent from the field.
Stanford's leisty defense allowed it
to get into transition more than it
had all season.
"Getting out on the break is
something we needed to do more
and we did it. [acobsen said. "It
gets the crowd into it also."
Because players were mov
ing faster, Giovacchini and
company relied on the outlet
t>ass more often.

"Guys would be out ahead,
which would create an advantage
where we'd get an easy shot. It
makes it easy on me," said Giovac
chini, who had two assists.
| Locklier led the Cougars with
12 points, Jerry McNair added 10
and Marcus Moore had eight.
A Barnes jumper with 0:10
left in the first half capped a 14-
4 run, giving Stanford a 42-23
halftime lead.
Freshman Josh Childress
scored all five of his points on con
secutive possessions in the second
half. He followed an exciting two
handed slam by hitting a three
pointer the next time down the
court to extend Stanford's lead to
68-40 with 8:20 to piny.
I he Cardinal next plays
Washington on Saturday at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion. Because
Southern California lost to Ari
zona last night, Stanford is still
only a game and a half behind in
the conference.
"It's a big game for us," Gio
vacchini said of the Washing
ton game. "We have to defend
our home court in this league

this year.
"You're happy about a 30-point
win but you don't celebrate it. VVe
need to sweep this home stand.
VVe don't need to split."
