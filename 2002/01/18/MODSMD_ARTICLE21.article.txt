" Ilieylx-at us pretty easily last time, so
it is very important that we're competitive
with them in this meet," Schavone said.
Earlier in the season, Schavone em
phasized the importance of the team's
focus on improving its strengths in prac

tition. Now the time has come to lest its
skills. "We are in the middle of our sea
