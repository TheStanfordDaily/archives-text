## Red Cross workers to interview prisoners at Guantanamo 
### 
Gl AM ANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE,
Cuba (AP) — Four members of the Inter
naiional (Committee of (lie Red dross ar
rived yesterda) to meet with U.S. officials
and interview do/ens of al-Qaida and
Taliban prisoners being held at this re
mote I S. military outpost.
1 lie \ isit was the first by independent
experts at Camp X-ray, which human
rights advocates sav provides substan
dard conditions lor the prisoners. U.S.
olli( iaU sav the tight security is necessary
and that the prisoners' rights are not
being \ iolated.
I he Red (Cross team of four, including
a doctor, arrived 1 liursday on a small

plane from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
I rs Boegli, head of the team, said
findings of the prisoners' conditions
would be shared with authorities but said
he wasn't sure whether the findings
would be made public.
During the day yesterday, guards
used basic commands in Arabic for some
of the prisoners while a fbrklift groaned,
hoisting materials to expand the tempo
rary detention facility.
Behind three fences and coils of
razor wire, prisoners with shaved heads
and orange jumpsuits sat in open-air
cells of chain-link fence. Occasionally,
Army guards led a prisoner out of a cell,

taking him fora walk in the heavily for
tified yard.
"For the most part, they do what
they're told," said Sgt. Lisajuve, an Army
guard who spoke to journalists who were
allowed to see the detention camp, but
only from about 150 yards away.
Military officials say the camp will soon
be able to hold 320 inmates, or more if
they are doubled up two to a cell. Work
ers also are building a permanent prison
to hold up to 2,000.
The United States is holding more
than 300 prisoners at the Marine base at
Kandahar airport, in Afghanistan, and a
few others elsewhere.

When they arrive, prisoners are given
a half sheet of paper to write to family
members or friends of their indefinite de
tention in Cuba.
Five interpreters using Arabic and
other languages help the guards commu
nicate with prisoners, officials said. The
unarmed guards carry booklets with the
pronunciation of some basic terms in
Arabic, such as "Walk!", "No!" and "Use
the latrine?"
Human rights groups have raised con
cerns over the tough sec urity imposed on
the prisoners — including small cells
open to the elements.
U.S. officials say tight security is need-

Ed because some prisoners have threat
ened to kill Americans and they include
some of the most dangerous al-Qaida
and Taliban fighters.
Amnesty International said housing
detainees in "cages" would "fall below
minimum standards for humane treat
ment," and that the temporary cells — 8-
by-8 feet — are too small.
Human tights groups also are con
cerned about the prisoners' status.
The United States reserves the right
to try them on its own terms and is not
calling them prisoners of war, a designa
tion that would invoke the Geneva
(Conventions.
