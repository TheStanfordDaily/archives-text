# Anderson creates 'royal' comedy

I'd swear to God that writers Wes Anderson and I.uke
Wilson don't start with a story, hut rather, just characters.

their distressed
childhoods, their
precarious adoles
cences,and their
warped adult eccen
tricities. 1 honestly
don't think they
write a screenplay as
much as they dictate

one — transcribing the inevitable, cataclysmic fallout of
their characters' interactions. That's my only explanation
for dialogue so bizarrely funny, and at the same time so
seamlessly, unhlinkingly natural.
The premise for " The Royal Tenenbaums" is as follows:
after neglecting and estranging his family, Royal Tenen
baum (Gene I lackman) returns home to make amends and
salve old wounds. Director Anderson's thumbprint is so dis
tinctive and pervasive in all his works that it's impossible not
to draw the inescapable comparisons between "The Royal
Tenenbaums" and his earlier masterpiece, "Rushmore."
1 hey both contain the same meticulous character studies,
but "Tenenbaums" relies more heavily on fragmented cari
catures — caricatures the characters can never quite leave
behind — and, consequently, the story never ripens quite as
well as it does in "Rushmore."
Hie hilarious "Tenenbaum" prologue, narrated by Alec
Baldwin, is the highpoint of the film — a blitzkrieg of one
liners, artfully compiling a dossier of the Tenenbaum chil
dren in their dysfunctional formative years. Each child is a
genius in their own right: Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) isa
wildly successful but neurotic entrepreneur; Margot Tenen
baum (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a depressive Pulitzer Prize-win
ning playwright; Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) is a ten
nis phenom known affectionately as the "Baumer," who re
grettably has a meltdown on live TV during the U.S. Open.

Paltrow gives a particularly adroit performance as the
chain-smoking, disillusioned artist. Her laconic, dipped
phrases and anguished, heavily lined eyes combine to pro
duce a minimalist comedic triumph At one point tier hus
band (an underused Kill Murray) asks her if she's cheating
on him — she deadpans, and replies accusingly, "1 can't
even begin to know how to answer that question." I ligh com
edy— I nearly choked on myju ju Bees.
But before 1 get too sidetracked, ii should be unequivo
cally stated that this is Gene Hackinan's movie and Gene
Hackman's alone. Playing the

emotionally negligent father,
Hacktnan steals the film with a
bullying gusto that just may pay
oft around ()scar time (ironical
ly the only other person who
might have been able to pull of
the role is co-star Bill Murray).
Try to imagine I lackman's Lex
I.uthor character mellowing
out a little and trying to raise a
family, trying to reconcile his
cartoonish braggardry and
total lack of empathy with a
struggling desire to make
amends with his alienated fami
ly. Good times.
The latter half of the film
takes an unexpectedly grim
twist, seemingly trying to re
mind the viewer that an emo
tionally abusive childhood has
very real repercussions down
the road. At times this message
is transmitted poignantly and
cathartically, but other times it
seems discordant and simply
out of place. I'm not sure the
characters ever quite become
human enough for this dra
matic shift to resonate as An-

derson wanted it to. Moreover, the murky, yet exceedingly
valid, message about familial consequences seems somewhat
nullified by an ending that's a little too cute, a little too nic e
ly wrapped up.
" l he Royal Tenenbaums" boasts a stellar cast, magnifi
cent acting, a memorable soundtrack and a thoroughly
walchable story, but it lacks a certain cohesion that Anderson
lias proven himself capable of creating. The film's most glar
ing shortcoming is that it fails to transcend the lofty bar that
Anderson has irrevocably raised for himself.

But before 1 get too sidetracked, ii should be unequivo
cally stated that this is Gene Hackinan's movie and Gene
Hackman's alone. Playing the

emotionally negligent father,
Hacktnan steals the film with a
bullying gusto that just may pay
oft around ()scar time (ironical
ly the only other person who
might have been able to pull of
the role is co-star Bill Murray).
Try to imagine I lackman's Lex
I.uthor character mellowing
out a little and trying to raise a
family, trying to reconcile his
cartoonish braggardry and
total lack of empathy with a
struggling desire to make
amends with his alienated fami
ly. Good times.
The latter half of the film
takes an unexpectedly grim
twist, seemingly trying to re
mind the viewer that an emo
tionally abusive childhood has
very real repercussions down
the road. At times this message
is transmitted poignantly and
cathartically, but other times it
seems discordant and simply
out of place. I'm not sure the
characters ever quite become
human enough for this dra
matic shift to resonate as An-

derson wanted it to. Moreover, the murky, yet exceedingly
valid, message about familial consequences seems somewhat
nullified by an ending that's a little too cute, a little too nic e
ly wrapped up.
" l he Royal Tenenbaums" boasts a stellar cast, magnifi
cent acting, a memorable soundtrack and a thoroughly
walchable story, but it lacks a certain cohesion that Anderson
lias proven himself capable of creating. The film's most glar
ing shortcoming is that it fails to transcend the lofty bar that
Anderson has irrevocably raised for himself.


Bet this looks like your family.
