."Eudora" isn't really a new
album from The Get Up Kids,
bin it's still a damn good one,
which somewhat alleviates the
pain of the group's delay in re
leasing their forthcoming
third full-length. In 1999, the
band launched their own
record label called I feroesand
Villains, signing themselves in
the process. "Eudora" is a
joint release from Heroes and
Villains and Vagrant Records,
and it gathers all of the band's

old 7" and compilation songs
otherwise unavailable, but
now neatly assembled on one
collection. These tracks in
< lude various cover songs and
alternate versions of songs
from the albums "Four
Minute Mile"and "Something
To Write 1 fome About."
[Tie Get Up Kids show off
their wide range of influences
in the large number of songs
they choose to cover — eight
iu all on the record. The list in
cludes such varied efforts as
David Bowie's "Suffragette

Their cover of New ()rder's
"Regret" stands out because,
although ii sounds appropri
ately new-waved out with its
drum machine backbeats, the
clean sound of the electric lead
continuously repeating the
song's riff alter each verse line
effectively drives the music
forward.
Also, it is the only song by
the band featuring key
boardist |aines Dewees on
lead vocals. Dewees. who is the
drummer for hardcore band
on-hiatus Coalesce, joined the
band in early 1999, but met
them back in 1997 when The
Get Up Kids and Coalesce put
out a split 7" reinterpreting
each other's songs. The Get
Up Kids song "Burned

song called "Harvest Of Ma
turity" from the bands' split
7", and it expertly transforms
Coalesced hardcore fury into
mid-tempo indie rock good
ness. Very cool.
The alternate versions of
album songs found on "F.u
dora" retain that raw pre-stu
dio-recorded sound which
differentiates them from
their produced counterparts,
but the band is doing its fans
a favor by including these
tracks on the album since all
of the 7"s from whence they
came are out of print. ()f par

titular interest are the hard
to-find songs from the haiiclVs
very first 7": an old version of
"Shorty" and a B-side called
"The Breathing Method."
"Kudora" doesn't ignore
newer material, however, as
evident in the inclusion of the
song "Up ()n The Roof' from
the 2001 split 7" with Rocket
From The Crypt.
Fven taking into account
the previous availability of all
ol these songs, "Eudora" is a
strong record because it al
lows the listener to trace the
evolution ol The (iet Up Kids'
sound as they progress
through time. Definitely rec
ommended for fans of the
band, and an above-average
listen lor everyone else as well.
