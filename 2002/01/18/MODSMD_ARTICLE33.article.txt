# Symphonic Notes

### EREZ YOELI 
In the 57 years of his life, Ludwig van
Beethoven amassed more fame and respect
than any composer before or since. like many
before him, Beethoven subsisted on the gen
erosity of noble patrons, yet he never wrote aris
tocratic music. Instead, he fix used on the mass
es, composing his music around battles and lie
roes, and, in the process, became one himself.
When he died in 1827, Beethoven's funeral
was attended by some 10,000 Viennese.
Today, Beethoven is still called "the people's

composer" by many, and his music is the most commonly heard in the classical
repertoire: recordings of Beethoven's music consistently out-sell those of all other
classical composers.
Beethoven's most famous symphonic works are his fifth and ninth symphonies,
but the seventh is no less impressive, innovative or likeable. It was the first sympho
ny to sport so massive an introduction and the lirst to lack a slow movement. It is also
notoriously difficult to perform, particularly the first movement, which contains se
ries of syncopated unisons in the Irencli horns and later with the brass and timpani.
The San Francisco Symphony played through such difficulties with facility. Fur
thermore, under the leadership of Ingo Metzmacher, they took advantage of
Beethoven's layered dynamics and robust tempos. The resulting performance was
brisk and at times surprising. I was a little disappointed in Metzmacher's rendition of
the second movement, as it lacked the depth of character which it deserves. Nonethe
less, Metzmacher's shallow approach was probably chosen to compliment his choice
of mood and tempo in the other movements. Within this context, it was perhaps
more appropriate than the more somber performances I have come to expect.
The Beethoven was preceded by Leonard Bernstein's Serenade, performed by
Joshua Bell. Although accompanied by his trade-mark writhing, Bell's performance
was excellent. I lis understanding of the piece was thorough, his interaction with the
orchestra seamless, but most of all, Bell was quite capable of pulling the most beauti
ful tones from his violin.
The first piece on the program was Karl 1 lartmann's Miserae, a Germanic sym
phonic poem full of dark timbres. I lartmann's colorful use of percussion and fun glis
sandos in the brass did much to liven the piece and the audience.
Despite its warm reception, Miserae, originally meant as a symphony, was not
much competition tor the remainder of the program. Bell, Bernstein and Beethoven
are tough acts to precede.
