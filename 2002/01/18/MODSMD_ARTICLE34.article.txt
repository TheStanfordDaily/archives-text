# Starsailor is Brit-Pop backwash

"Love Is I lore," the debut album
from the U.K. quartet Starsailor,
plays a nasty little trick on you. You
insert the CD into your player and
hc*t»iii listening. The opening notes
of "Tie Up My Hands," the first

Starsailor J&Ssn
"Love Is Here" Wykj */.
Capitol Records (W

track, are unassuming. I he dark,
melodic guitar strumming isn't any
thing you think you should be wor
ried about. Singer James Walsh be
gins crooning about something
vaguely emotional. As the second
song, "Poor Misguided Fool," starts
up, though, you realize you've got
ten yoursell intoadifficult situation.
The band's sound grows all too
familiar. This is nothing new — a
medley of downbeat acoustic guitar
and piano with whiny British vocals.
Like many modern r<x k bands, they
are melodramatic, but with a degree

of candor that doesn't seem feigned.
The grow clingy very quickly,
though, much like an ex-boyfriend
or girlfriend who sucks you in with
their sincerity, only to make it clear a
minute later that nothing has
changed. I Vicky little hitch!
Piat's how each of the 11 songs
plays out. At the start of each track,
I expected something new. To no
avail, it seems. By track three, it is
dear that this band isn't doing any
thing they didn't do live minutes
earlier on the same album. Luckily,
the power switch is always nearby. I
was tempted to reach for it more
than a lew times while listening to
this album.
"Love Is Here" isn't wretched
because of the similarity of the
songs. Many musicians have strik
ing parallels in their work while re
maining original; take (leorge (.Un
ion. Nirvana, Bob Dylan orSleater-
Kinncy as examples. What soured
Starsailor for me was that the band
ultimately tries the nerves.
Walsh's singing is nothing if
not irritating. He imitates Thom
Yorke of Radiohead, but sounds
flat and uninspired as he snivels

his way through each song. This
fact coupled with the absurd
lyrics, makes the album seem des
tined for the "trade-in" pile of my
music collection.
Exhibit A? "Alcoholic," which ap
peared as a single earlier this year. I
winced at lyrics like "Don't you
know you've got your daddy's eyes

/And Daddy was an alcoholic." I
thought I was glad when my l()th
grade English teacher stopped
making us read our own poetry out
loud in class, but "Alcoholic" could
make anyone yearn for the profun
dity of my poet peers in high school.
With the success of Radiohead in
the U.K. and the States, record la

bds seem eager to sign groups that
can ape the "Britpop" style of
music. You can't fake a good band,
though, 110 matter how hard you
try. If good music from across the
Atlantic is what you crave, try Ash,
Radiohead, Blur or even Pulp.
Leave Starsailor to the 10th grade
poetry crowd.


That's a smug look for someone with his hands in his pants.
