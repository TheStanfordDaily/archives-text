# Ridley and Jerry make art, money
## 'Black Hawk' ghastly, beautiful 
### ERIC HAND 
Movie mogul Jerry Bruck
heimer is t lie little devil hovering
over director Ridley Scott's shoul
der, whispering of unlimited
budgets and dumbed-down
blockbuster bonanzas. Scott has,
for the better part of his career,
shrugged off Bruckheimer's se
ductions, producing visually defi
ant masterpieces like "Blade Run
ner" and "Alien." In recent years,
though, Scott's attitude has con
verged with Bruckheimer's pop
ulist sensibilities; both the garish
"Hannibal" and unsubtle "Gladi
ator" were smash hits despite
their critical failings.
Now, with "Black I lawk Down,"
the two are allied for the first time,
and the Faustian bargain is nearly
complete. Scott's penchant lor visu
al magic Is as indomitable as ever,
but nuance and thought fulness liill
prey to only slightly mollified
Bruckheimer jingoisms. The
movie is a ghastly, beautiful and ex
hausting portrait of the pointless
ness of war; the highest moral claim
disc ussed here is man's instinct lot
sell-preservation and the preserva
tion of his comrades. Not yourtyp-

ical U.S. Army recruitment video,
which probably bothered the
Bruckmeister a bit.
List week, Intermission spoke
with Scott and Bruckheimer at the
Cliff Hotel. (Rumor has it that
Mandy Moore was also present at
the swank hotel, prancing and
parading for Teen magazine, but I
missed her.)
The two are clearly friends and
appear completely at ease together.
Scott immediately sets to pulling 011
one of his ever-present Montecristo
#2 cigars (a trademark that he
shamelessly inserts into the film),
while Bruckheimer kicks back in
his chic Italian leather get-up.
They both made their start in
commercials in the early '70s, and it

shows — in their films, and in their
financial success. Bruckheimer is
the first to explain that he operates
in an entertainment business, and
that commercial and video direc
tors become "disciplined filmmak
ers because they're using someone
else's money."
"There's a record company
that's watching to ensure they're
coming in on budget,"he says.
"And with commercials you have a
client and an agency to watch what
you're doing."
For Scott, coming straight out of
art school, "there was no film
school." Advertising studios be
came his surrogate training
grounds. Commercials, he says,
gave him the confidence to exert
absolute control over the look and
feel ofthe movie.
"You have to say, 'You over
there, set three cameras!' " he says.
"Ifyou don't do that, there's a lot of
nudging and people are thinking,
'The fucker doesn't know what he's
doing.' You have to be a real field
commander, and [video and com
mercial directors] have been
through it. They know how to bud
get their time."
The advertising background

may have given them confidence in
their technical skills, but, with the
ad company supplying the narra
tive, it also fostered a devil-may
care attitude towards thematic con
tent and character. Where writer
directors pursue their idiosyncratic
vision from start to finish, Scott has
always relied 011 someone else to
supply the story.
With "Black Hawk Down,"
too, Scott is given a door-to-door
roadmap — in this case, Mark
Bowden's prize winning piece of
journalism; which recounts the
1991 events in Somali minute-by
minute.
"We just followed the menu as
recorded by Mark and his inter
views," Scott says. "Usually I can

work the action out."
The action is impressive, but the
characters sure suffer. The all-male
cast is virtually interchangeable; the
only way one can distinguish the
soldiers is by tracing the accents to
the actors' national roots: Orlando
Bloom (English) and Eric liana
(Australian) are passable Yankees,
but Ewan MacGregor's Scottish
brogue doesn't come close to (Toss
ing the Atlantic.
Scott has always been at his best
when dialogue is kept to a
minimum. Harrison Ford (Blade
Runner) and Sigourney Weaver
(Alien) are remembered more for
their grimacing rites ol passage
than for their soliloquies. So per
haps we should be thankful that
Bruckheimer wasn't able to stuff
the dialogue box with more stink
ing one-liners. I lie dialogue,
most ly grunted Army lingo, is kept
to a minumum and is perfectly in
tone with the matter-of-fact sto
icism of the movie.
"I think facts and procedure
are always interesting," Scott says.
"One of the best cop films ever
made was 'French Connection' —
rent it this afternoon, and you'd
still be pretty well entertained.
That's all about procedure, proce
dures driven by a character." Scott
lets action and circumstance de
termine character, not the other
way around.
Just as the characters lack multi
dimensionality, so too is the the
matic content of the movie one
sided. Perhaps this is another arti
fact of filming commercials —
where a company is paying to pro
pagandize. The movie opens with a
kindergarten lesson on the Somali
plight, and minutes later, Josh 1 far
nett — back from Operation
Doolittle with nary an eyebrow
singe — expresses his idealism
along with a loudness for the "skin
nies." But we can't care too much
because, after all, we need some
black Muslim enemies to thrash (or
the remainder of the movie. The
Somalis are reduced to a malevo
lent black horde; they look like en
croaching insects from above. This
is us versus them — quite literally
white versus black — and there can
be no doubt as to who is noble and
who is savage.
"It's not a recruiting film," Scott
says, "but it's certainly a celebration
of what [soldiers) do for us lor a liv
ing. We don't know what they do.
We know they go into a few holes in
the ground in Afghanistan but we
don't know what that means. That's
scarier than shit."
"It's anti-war but pro-Army,"
he says. "So Sept. 1 1 is about pay
ing attention."
A noble sentiment, but a bit

disingenuous fora movie that, they
admitted, wasn't touched or re-cut
after Sept. 11. How could they have
made it any more rah-rah America?
Despite these criticisms, the
movie is still an immersive visual ex
perience. Vet again, Scott has creat
ed a complete world. 1 .ike the
Bradbury building iu "Blade Run
ner," like the spaceship in "Alien,"
we come to know the geography of
the Mogadishu streets —at dusk,
at dawn, from above, from below
— with a hellish intimacy.
And Scott manages to find mo
ments of delicate beauty in this in
ferno. Wisps of smoke dance from
spent bullet cartridges while we
hear, in slo-tno, the cheerful ping of
each as it strikes concrete. In anoth
er fantastic moment, we watch —
from an aerial shot high overhead
— the god-like approach of the
Black Hawks against the turquoise
backdrop of the beach and ocean
below. The rhythmic thunder of
the rotors drops away to nothing.
1 : i i i... .1

and is replaced by the nervous
thuds of human heartbeat,
even as we cut to close-ups of
I he soldier's tense liices.
Scott even creates a per
verse beauty out of the
painfully grotesque. Remind
ed that he had once said he
"liked to explore pain," Scott
jokes, "1 did? Maybe with my
girlfriend in 1972."
"So many battle scenes
have been done," he ex
plains. "You're always trying
to think of a way of showing it
differently."
"So all the events, like
Galentine losing his thumb,
Ruiz getting blown in half—

and living for two and a half hours
afterwords — all those things, fact
is far more exotic than fiction. So I
thought, 'I'll follow that.' "
And, indeed, he does follow that,
at one point invasively poking his
camera into a thigh wound, where
we see a rubbery, cherry red
femoral artery burst. Like a Pent
house magazine spread, it is porno
graphic, yet gripping in its anatom
ical horror.
I like to think of "Black Hawk
Down" as a distillation of the 20-
minute Normandy sequence in
"Saving Private Ryan," but with
out the Spielberg schmaltz (and
with only a minimum of Bruck
heimer bombast replacing it). Or
one can think of it as "The Thin
Red Line" without Malick's rumi
native philosophy. While it may
have been a bit too smug in its tone
of moral superiority, "Black I lawk
Down" is a stark and unblinking
look at the anonymity and absur
dity of modern war.

the actors' national roots: Orlando
Bloom (English) and Eric liana
(Australian) are passable Yankees,
but Ewan MacGregor's Scottish
brogue doesn't come close to (Toss
ing the Atlantic.
Scott has always been at his best
when dialogue is kept to a
minimum. Harrison Ford (Blade
Runner) and Sigourney Weaver
(Alien) are remembered more for
their grimacing rites ol passage
than for their soliloquies. So per
haps we should be thankful that
Bruckheimer wasn't able to stuff
the dialogue box with more stink
ing one-liners. I lie dialogue,
most ly grunted Army lingo, is kept
to a minumum and is perfectly in
tone with the matter-of-fact sto
icism of the movie.
"I think facts and procedure
are always interesting," Scott says.
"One of the best cop films ever
made was 'French Connection' —
rent it this afternoon, and you'd
still be pretty well entertained.
That's all about procedure, proce
dures driven by a character." Scott
lets action and circumstance de
termine character, not the other
way around.
Just as the characters lack multi
dimensionality, so too is the the
matic content of the movie one
sided. Perhaps this is another arti
fact of filming commercials —
where a company is paying to pro
pagandize. The movie opens with a
kindergarten lesson on the Somali
plight, and minutes later, Josh 1 far
nett — back from Operation
Doolittle with nary an eyebrow
singe — expresses his idealism
along with a loudness for the "skin
nies." But we can't care too much
because, after all, we need some
black Muslim enemies to thrash (or
the remainder of the movie. The
Somalis are reduced to a malevo
lent black horde; they look like en
croaching insects from above. This
is us versus them — quite literally
white versus black — and there can
be no doubt as to who is noble and
who is savage.
"It's not a recruiting film," Scott
says, "but it's certainly a celebration
of what [soldiers) do for us lor a liv
ing. We don't know what they do.
We know they go into a few holes in
the ground in Afghanistan but we
don't know what that means. That's
scarier than shit."
"It's anti-war but pro-Army,"
he says. "So Sept. 1 1 is about pay
ing attention."
A noble sentiment, but a bit

disingenuous fora movie that, they
admitted, wasn't touched or re-cut
after Sept. 11. How could they have
made it any more rah-rah America?
Despite these criticisms, the
movie is still an immersive visual ex
perience. Vet again, Scott has creat
ed a complete world. 1 .ike the
Bradbury building iu "Blade Run
ner," like the spaceship in "Alien,"
we come to know the geography of
the Mogadishu streets —at dusk,
at dawn, from above, from below
— with a hellish intimacy.
And Scott manages to find mo
ments of delicate beauty in this in
ferno. Wisps of smoke dance from
spent bullet cartridges while we
hear, in slo-tno, the cheerful ping of
each as it strikes concrete. In anoth
er fantastic moment, we watch —
from an aerial shot high overhead
— the god-like approach of the
Black Hawks against the turquoise
backdrop of the beach and ocean
below. The rhythmic thunder of
the rotors drops away to nothing.
1 : i i i... .1

and is replaced by the nervous
thuds of human heartbeat,
even as we cut to close-ups of
I he soldier's tense liices.
Scott even creates a per
verse beauty out of the
painfully grotesque. Remind
ed that he had once said he
"liked to explore pain," Scott
jokes, "1 did? Maybe with my
girlfriend in 1972."
"So many battle scenes
have been done," he ex
plains. "You're always trying
to think of a way of showing it
differently."
"So all the events, like
Galentine losing his thumb,
Ruiz getting blown in half—

and living for two and a half hours
afterwords — all those things, fact
is far more exotic than fiction. So I
thought, 'I'll follow that.' "
And, indeed, he does follow that,
at one point invasively poking his
camera into a thigh wound, where
we see a rubbery, cherry red
femoral artery burst. Like a Pent
house magazine spread, it is porno
graphic, yet gripping in its anatom
ical horror.
I like to think of "Black Hawk
Down" as a distillation of the 20-
minute Normandy sequence in
"Saving Private Ryan," but with
out the Spielberg schmaltz (and
with only a minimum of Bruck
heimer bombast replacing it). Or
one can think of it as "The Thin
Red Line" without Malick's rumi
native philosophy. While it may
have been a bit too smug in its tone
of moral superiority, "Black I lawk
Down" is a stark and unblinking
look at the anonymity and absur
dity of modern war.


And behind door #2 . ..


This fucker knows what he's doing


Oracle's first quarter profits look strong
Movie mogul Jerry Bruck
heimer is t lie little devil hovering
over director Ridley Scott's shoul
der, whispering of unlimited
budgets and dumbed-down
blockbuster bonanzas. Scott has,
for the better part of his career,
shrugged off Bruckheimer's se
ductions, producing visually defi
ant masterpieces like "Blade Run
ner" and "Alien." In recent years,
though, Scott's attitude has con
verged with Bruckheimer's pop
ulist sensibilities; both the garish
"Hannibal" and unsubtle "Gladi
ator" were smash hits despite
their critical failings.
Now, with "Black I lawk Down,"
the two are allied for the first time,
and the Faustian bargain is nearly
complete. Scott's penchant lor visu
al magic Is as indomitable as ever,
but nuance and thought fulness liill
prey to only slightly mollified
Bruckheimer jingoisms. The
movie is a ghastly, beautiful and ex
hausting portrait of the pointless
ness of war; the highest moral claim
disc ussed here is man's instinct lot
sell-preservation and the preserva
tion of his comrades. Not yourtyp-

ical U.S. Army recruitment video,
which probably bothered the
Bruckmeister a bit.
List week, Intermission spoke
with Scott and Bruckheimer at the
Cliff Hotel. (Rumor has it that
Mandy Moore was also present at
the swank hotel, prancing and
parading for Teen magazine, but I
missed her.)
The two are clearly friends and
appear completely at ease together.
Scott immediately sets to pulling 011
one of his ever-present Montecristo
#2 cigars (a trademark that he
shamelessly inserts into the film),
while Bruckheimer kicks back in
his chic Italian leather get-up.
They both made their start in
commercials in the early '70s, and it

shows — in their films, and in their
financial success. Bruckheimer is
the first to explain that he operates
in an entertainment business, and
that commercial and video direc
tors become "disciplined filmmak
ers because they're using someone
else's money."
"There's a record company
that's watching to ensure they're
coming in on budget,"he says.
"And with commercials you have a
client and an agency to watch what
you're doing."
For Scott, coming straight out of
art school, "there was no film
school." Advertising studios be
came his surrogate training
grounds. Commercials, he says,
gave him the confidence to exert
absolute control over the look and
feel ofthe movie.
"You have to say, 'You over
there, set three cameras!' " he says.
"Ifyou don't do that, there's a lot of
nudging and people are thinking,
'The fucker doesn't know what he's
doing.' You have to be a real field
commander, and [video and com
mercial directors] have been
through it. They know how to bud
get their time."
The advertising background

may have given them confidence in
their technical skills, but, with the
ad company supplying the narra
tive, it also fostered a devil-may
care attitude towards thematic con
tent and character. Where writer
directors pursue their idiosyncratic
vision from start to finish, Scott has
always relied 011 someone else to
supply the story.
With "Black Hawk Down,"
too, Scott is given a door-to-door
roadmap — in this case, Mark
Bowden's prize winning piece of
journalism; which recounts the
1991 events in Somali minute-by
minute.
"We just followed the menu as
recorded by Mark and his inter
views," Scott says. "Usually I can

work the action out."
The action is impressive, but the
characters sure suffer. The all-male
cast is virtually interchangeable; the
only way one can distinguish the
soldiers is by tracing the accents to
the actors' national roots: Orlando
Bloom (English) and Eric liana
(Australian) are passable Yankees,
but Ewan MacGregor's Scottish
brogue doesn't come close to (Toss
ing the Atlantic.
Scott has always been at his best

have been done," he ex
plains. "You're always trying
to think of a way of showing it
differently."
"So all the events, like
Galentine losing his thumb,
Ruiz getting blown in half—

and living for two and a half hours
afterwords — all those things, fact
is far more exotic than fiction. So I
thought, 'I'll follow that.' "
And, indeed, he does follow that,
at one point invasively poking his
camera into a thigh wound, where
we see a rubbery, cherry red
femoral artery burst. Like a Pent
house magazine spread, it is porno
graphic, yet gripping in its anatom
ical horror.
I like to think of "Black Hawk
Down" as a distillation of the 20-
minute Normandy sequence in
"Saving Private Ryan," but with
out the Spielberg schmaltz (and
with only a minimum of Bruck
heimer bombast replacing it). Or
one can think of it as "The Thin
Red Line" without Malick's rumi
native philosophy. While it may
have been a bit too smug in its tone
of moral superiority, "Black I lawk
Down" is a stark and unblinking
look at the anonymity and absur
dity of modern war.


And behind door #2 . ..


This fucker knows what he's doing


Oracle's first quarter profits look strong
Movie mogul Jerry Bruck
heimer is t lie little devil hovering
over director Ridley Scott's shoul
der, whispering of unlimited
budgets and dumbed-down
blockbuster bonanzas. Scott has,
for the better part of his career,
shrugged off Bruckheimer's se
ductions, producing visually defi
ant masterpieces like "Blade Run
ner" and "Alien." In recent years,
though, Scott's attitude has con
verged with Bruckheimer's pop
ulist sensibilities; both the garish
"Hannibal" and unsubtle "Gladi
ator" were smash hits despite
their critical failings.
Now, with "Black I lawk Down,"
the two are allied for the first time,
and the Faustian bargain is nearly
complete. Scott's penchant lor visu
al magic Is as indomitable as ever,
but nuance and thought fulness liill
prey to only slightly mollified
Bruckheimer jingoisms. The
movie is a ghastly, beautiful and ex
hausting portrait of the pointless
ness of war; the highest moral claim
disc ussed here is man's instinct lot
sell-preservation and the preserva
tion of his comrades. Not yourtyp-

ical U.S. Army recruitment video,
which probably bothered the
Bruckmeister a bit.
List week, Intermission spoke
with Scott and Bruckheimer at the
Cliff Hotel. (Rumor has it that
Mandy Moore was also present at
the swank hotel, prancing and
parading for Teen magazine, but I
missed her.)
The two are clearly friends and
appear completely at ease together.
Scott immediately sets to pulling 011
one of his ever-present Montecristo
#2 cigars (a trademark that he
shamelessly inserts into the film),
while Bruckheimer kicks back in
his chic Italian leather get-up.
They both made their start in
commercials in the early '70s, and it

shows — in their films, and in their
financial success. Bruckheimer is
the first to explain that he operates
in an entertainment business, and
that commercial and video direc
tors become "disciplined filmmak
ers because they're using someone
else's money."
"There's a record company
that's watching to ensure they're
coming in on budget,"he says.
"And with commercials you have a
client and an agency to watch what
you're doing."
For Scott, coming straight out of
art school, "there was no film
school." Advertising studios be
came his surrogate training
grounds. Commercials, he says,
gave him the confidence to exert
absolute control over the look and
feel ofthe movie.
"You have to say, 'You over
there, set three cameras!' " he says.
"Ifyou don't do that, there's a lot of
nudging and people are thinking,
'The fucker doesn't know what he's
doing.' You have to be a real field
commander, and [video and com
mercial directors] have been
through it. They know how to bud
get their time."
The advertising background

may have given them confidence in
their technical skills, but, with the
ad company supplying the narra
tive, it also fostered a devil-may
care attitude towards thematic con
tent and character. Where writer
directors pursue their idiosyncratic
vision from start to finish, Scott has
always relied 011 someone else to
supply the story.
With "Black Hawk Down,"
too, Scott is given a door-to-door
roadmap — in this case, Mark
Bowden's prize winning piece of
journalism; which recounts the
1991 events in Somali minute-by
minute.
"We just followed the menu as
recorded by Mark and his inter
views," Scott says. "Usually I can

work the action out."
The action is impressive, but the
characters sure suffer. The all-male
cast is virtually interchangeable; the
only way one can distinguish the
soldiers is by tracing the accents to
the actors' national roots: Orlando
Bloom (English) and Eric liana
(Australian) are passable Yankees,
but Ewan MacGregor's Scottish
brogue doesn't come close to (Toss
ing the Atlantic.
Scott has always been at his best
when dialogue is kept to a
minimum. Harrison Ford (Blade
Runner) and Sigourney Weaver
(Alien) are remembered more for
their grimacing rites ol passage
than for their soliloquies. So per
haps we should be thankful that
Bruckheimer wasn't able to stuff
the dialogue box with more stink
ing one-liners. I lie dialogue,
most ly grunted Army lingo, is kept
to a minumum and is perfectly in
tone with the matter-of-fact sto
icism of the movie.
"I think facts and procedure
are always interesting," Scott says.
"One of the best cop films ever
made was 'French Connection' —
rent it this afternoon, and you'd
still be pretty well entertained.
That's all about procedure, proce
dures driven by a character." Scott
lets action and circumstance de
termine character, not the other
way around.
Just as the characters lack multi
dimensionality, so too is the the
matic content of the movie one
sided. Perhaps this is another arti
fact of filming commercials —
where a company is paying to pro
pagandize. The movie opens with a
kindergarten lesson on the Somali
plight, and minutes later, Josh 1 far
nett — back from Operation
Doolittle with nary an eyebrow
singe — expresses his idealism
along with a loudness for the "skin
nies." But we can't care too much
because, after all, we need some
black Muslim enemies to thrash (or
the remainder of the movie. The
Somalis are reduced to a malevo
lent black horde; they look like en
croaching insects from above. This
is us versus them — quite literally
white versus black — and there can
be no doubt as to who is noble and
who is savage.
"It's not a recruiting film," Scott
says, "but it's certainly a celebration
of what [soldiers) do for us lor a liv
ing. We don't know what they do.
We know they go into a few holes in
the ground in Afghanistan but we
don't know what that means. That's
scarier than shit."
"It's anti-war but pro-Army,"
he says. "So Sept. 1 1 is about pay
ing attention."
A noble sentiment, but a bit

disingenuous fora movie that, they
admitted, wasn't touched or re-cut
after Sept. 11. How could they have
made it any more rah-rah America?
Despite these criticisms, the
movie is still an immersive visual ex
perience. Vet again, Scott has creat
ed a complete world. 1 .ike the
Bradbury building iu "Blade Run
ner," like the spaceship in "Alien,"
we come to know the geography of
the Mogadishu streets —at dusk,
at dawn, from above, from below
— with a hellish intimacy.
And Scott manages to find mo
ments of delicate beauty in this in
ferno. Wisps of smoke dance from
spent bullet cartridges while we
hear, in slo-tno, the cheerful ping of
each as it strikes concrete. In anoth
er fantastic moment, we watch —
from an aerial shot high overhead
— the god-like approach of the
Black Hawks against the turquoise
backdrop of the beach and ocean
below. The rhythmic thunder of
the rotors drops away to nothing.
1 : i i i... .1

and is replaced by the nervous
thuds of human heartbeat,
even as we cut to close-ups of
I he soldier's tense liices.
Scott even creates a per
verse beauty out of the
painfully grotesque. Remind
ed that he had once said he
"liked to explore pain," Scott
jokes, "1 did? Maybe with my
girlfriend in 1972."
"So many battle scenes
have been done," he ex
plains. "You're always trying
to think of a way of showing it
differently."
"So all the events, like
Galentine losing his thumb,
Ruiz getting blown in half—

and living for two and a half hours
afterwords — all those things, fact
is far more exotic than fiction. So I
thought, 'I'll follow that.' "
And, indeed, he does follow that,
at one point invasively poking his
camera into a thigh wound, where
we see a rubbery, cherry red
femoral artery burst. Like a Pent
house magazine spread, it is porno
graphic, yet gripping in its anatom
ical horror.
I like to think of "Black Hawk
Down" as a distillation of the 20-
minute Normandy sequence in
"Saving Private Ryan," but with
out the Spielberg schmaltz (and
with only a minimum of Bruck
heimer bombast replacing it). Or
one can think of it as "The Thin
Red Line" without Malick's rumi
native philosophy. While it may
have been a bit too smug in its tone
of moral superiority, "Black I lawk

dity of modern war.
