The truth is that "Kandahar," a
film by acclaimed Iranian filmmak

ilk- mainstream public were it not
for the recent events surrounding
Afghanistan. That would truly
have been unfortunate, because
this film, though flawed, elucidates
the circumstances around the cur
rent conflict more than any New
York limes article or (INN story
ever could.
Filmed quite a bit before the cur
rent war, "Kandahar" avoids mak
ing any direct political statements,
even if some are implied. Rather, it
focuses on an Afghan-born Canadi
an journalist, Nafas, and her des
perate journey into Afghanistan

after she receives a letter from her
suicidal sister.
The story of Nafas, played by
real-life Canadian journalist
Nelofer Pa/ira, closely mirrors an
actual trip Pa/ira made into
Afghanistan before meeting di
rector Makhmalbaf. The beauti
ful Pazira shares the screen with a
cast of others who have never
acted before.
The result is a uniquely dramat
ic film that sometimes mimics the
style of a documentary. It is com
posed of several vignettes sur
rounding Nafas' trip, each of which
manifests the bleakness of Afghan
life. They come together in a
tremendously morose and tragic
cinematic mosaic.
At a Red Cross camp, two tired
doctors distribute prosthetic limbs
to victims of landmines. As plastic
legs parachute to earth from a relief
helicopter, the amputees hobble to
ward them on crutches, gazing san
guinely skyward. The scene, while
beautifully filmed, suffers only from
the acting of the two doctors who
seem to lack depth or even compas

sion. This, it seems, is the inherent
limitation of filming a movie with
out professional actors.
Without a doubt, the saddest
scenes are those depicting Afghan
women. Smothered by the body-en
veloping cloth of the burqa, these
women are symbolically and literal
ly cut off from the rest of humanity.
As a group of young girls prepares
to leave their school in an Iranian
refugee camp for Taliban-con
trolled Afghanistan, where there
are no schools for girls, their male
teacher offers a bit of consolation
and hope. "One day,"he says omi
nously, "the world will see your
troubles and come to your aid."
As a filmmaker, Makhmalbaf
takes care to address with calculated
subtlety other aspects of the Afghan
experience. Several of the incidents
in "Kandahar" are humorous in a
bitter and morbid way.
While Nafas walks across the
desert with a young boy, Khak, who
has agreed to serve as her paid
guide, the two stumble across a
skeleton. I hough Nafas shrieks and
flees in terror, Khak kneels enthusi

astically to pick the body clean of
valuables.
later, his only concern is pester
ing Nafas to buy a ring he found on
the corpse. Thinking little of the fact
that it came from a dead body, he
tells her that for just a few dollars,
she can have a ring that matches the
color of her eyes. Whether he is un
aware of the destruction around
him or has simply grown desensi
tized to it, the scene underscores the

despair that colors the film.
Perhaps this is to suggest that the
unwritten future is the only .hope
and salvation the Afghans have in
the world.
