# Guzman Tangos
## 
### SANDEEP GOPALAN 
I fyou saw Viviana (luzman's performance at the Freight & Salvage I his Saturday and, struck
by Ms. (iu/.man's joie de vivre, came away with the beliefthat life had been a bed of roses for her,
you couldn't be more wrong. Forced to move to the Bay Area from her birthplace, Concepcion,
(Ihile, in order to obtain better medical attention (necessitated by the absence of hip sockets),
Ms. Guzman's life has been punctuated by painful surgeries. In fact, it was only after her 10th
stint under the scalpel (at the Stanford Medical (Center in 1999) that she has been able to walk
without a limp. Yet the surgeon's knife has not left even the slightest scar on her sunny disposi
tion. For even thesprightliest of us, belly dancing is not exactly a walk in the park. Ms. Guzman's
unabashed rendition, so full of vim, reduces us to a state of disbelief.
Notwithstanding the more than competent jiggling of her midriff, Ms. Guzman's forte is
clearly the flute. I ler mastery extends from the small-sized Irish to the ironically large (Ihinese
(incidentally, made of Jade) to the hole-less Norwegian. She plays each with equal aplomb to
craft a melange of'mellifluous music that transports you from the steamy seductiveness of Moor-

ish Andalusia to the mysterious Orient. In between,
she even gets the audience to clap in tune, simulat
ing the sounds of an impatient customer knocking
on the doors of a South American brothel.
Ms. Guzman brings to her craft the insouciant
ease that is the sure indicator of great talent. I ler
performance is peppered with liberal doses of
homegrown humor that primes the audience for
uninhibited enjoyment. It helps that she brings an
unmistakable sense of delight and conviviality that
float on her delicious notes.
Saturday's performance was enlivened by the hat
changing routine of guitarist ('•uillermo (iarcia. I lis
antics even caused Ms. Guzman to miss a note as she
could not contain her laughter, but the audience
would have forgiven her for anything that night.
It was not all music — there was plenty of danc
ing, too. Garcia's girlfriend Tianne Frias performed
a solo of such sensuousness that an octogenarian
gentleman in the row in front of me was reduced to
a series of painful sighs! Garcia and Frias also per
formed some tangos together.
I he belly dancing was a mixed bag. Jill Parker, of
Ultra Gypsy, was splendidly graceful. Unfortunate
ly, much of the subsequent acts were not in the same
league. This was principally because of the limita-


This must be the ironically large Chinese.
tions of the Freight 8c Sal
vage as a venue for this sort
of thing, fhe tiny stage
seemed to inhibit the per
formers and the constant
fear of hitting your fellow
dancers in the face does not
aid the process. ' I 'his was
particularly true of the
grand finale, an act that
seemed to have been well
conceptualized, but was
wholly lost to the audience
(bailing those in the first
two rows) because it was
performed offstage at the
same level as the crowd.

Altera few minulesof t rail
ing our necks in uncom
fortable angles in an at
tempt to see something
(apart from the oddly clad
chaps banging on about on
the stage), most of us just
gave up. Ultra Gypsy
would do well to choose a
different venue for their
next performance, unless
the Freight & Salvage's
management can desist
from cramming everyone
and their neighbor onto
the floor.
Despite the minor flaws,
the "Music of Passion: from
I'ango to Flamenco" was a
stellar performance. Vi
viana (in/man is a rare tal
ent. She needs to be heard.
