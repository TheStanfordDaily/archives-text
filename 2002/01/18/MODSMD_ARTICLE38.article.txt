### CATHERINE CRUMP 
I'hrce ghosts currently haunt the Curran
Theater. Reminiscing over times long past,
they provide an intensely relevant perspec
tive on science as a weapon of mass destruc
tion and the conflicting values of loyalty to
one's country and loyalty to friends.
Michael Frayn's play "Copenhagen" de
tails the interactions of three historical fig
ures. One is German physicist Werner
lleisenberg, who was admired as a brilliant
young man for developing the uncertainty
principle and reviled tor the rest of his lilt' for
his role as advisor to the Nazis on the viability
of atomic weapons, fhe others are the Dan
ish physic ist Niels Bohr, a Nobel Prize winner
and lather tigure to I leisenlxTg, and Bohr's
wife Margrethe.
The event that torments them is Heisen
berg's visit to the Bohr household in 1941. By
then, lleisenberg was an eminent German
physicist, and a half-Jewish Bohr lived in fear
for his life in occupied Denmark. 'I he central
question of the play is, why did lleisenberg
make the visit? Together, they obsessively
recreate (and recreate and recreate) the
meeting.
The two physicists approach I leisenberg's
motivations scientifically while a skeptical
Margrethe observes. Did he come to probe

Bohr for secrets of the Allies' nuclear pro
gram? To warn Bohr about the German

atomic program? Margrethe attacks these
appeals to abstract, geo-political motiva
tions and suggests that his reasons were
purely personal: those ofan uncertain and
isolated young man seeking the approval
of his old mentor.
What is so gripping about the play is how
these men try to grapple with the awesome
power their science has unleashed: atomic
weapons. Their backgrounds have not given
them the toolstocome to grips with the moral
implications of that power. Physics was an in
tellectual game, carried out in cozy parlors
and in sec luded universities.
World War II changed everything for
them. Heisenljerg and Bohr both were bur
dened with the moral weight of their role in
the development of weapons of unprece
dented destructive power. Ironically, I leisen
berg, whose work led to the death of no one,
was reviled as a Nazi for the balance of his life,
while Bohr, whose work at Los Alamos con-


Why are we walking on the moon?
tributcd to the development
of weapons that killed hun
dreds of thousands of people,
remained a respected found
ing father of atomic physics.
As Margrethe, Mariette
Hartley is simply excellent.
She begins as a quiet charac
ter in the first act, serving as
hostess for the two men, urg
ing them to discuss anything
but politics. But behind her
politeness one senses the
sharp and insightful woman
who becomes a stronger pres
ence as the play progresses.
I.en Canon's Bohr is apt as a

grumpy set lovable old pro
fessor, and Hank Stratten
captures Heisenberg's fero
cious ambition.
Copenhagen is not for
everyone. It is, after all, an ex
tended conversation about
particle physics. Long seg
ments seem like a lecture in
Physics 101, with rapid expla
nations of concepts like the
uncertainty principle and
complementarity. The set is
sparse and the intensity of
emotions raised by the meet
ings has mellowed with the
passage of time. It is a play
whose drama springs from the
vitality of the ideas discussed.
Don't go out fora heavy meal
before seeing the play — grab
a coffee instead.
