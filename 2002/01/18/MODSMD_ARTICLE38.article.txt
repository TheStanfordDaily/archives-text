### CATHERINE CRUMP 
I'hrce ghosts currently haunt the Curran
Theater. Reminiscing over times long past,
they provide an intensely relevant perspec
tive on science as a weapon of mass destruc
tion and the conflicting values of loyalty to
one's country and loyalty to friends.
Michael Frayn's play "Copenhagen" de
tails the interactions of three historical fig
ures. One is German physicist Werner
lleisenberg, who was admired as a brilliant
young man for developing the uncertainty
principle and reviled tor the rest of his lilt' for
his role as advisor to the Nazis on the viability
of atomic weapons, fhe others are the Dan
ish physic ist Niels Bohr, a Nobel Prize winner
and lather tigure to I leisenlxTg, and Bohr's
wife Margrethe.
The event that torments them is Heisen
berg's visit to the Bohr household in 1941. By
then, lleisenberg was an eminent German
physicist, and a half-Jewish Bohr lived in fear
for his life in occupied Denmark. 'I he central
question of the play is, why did lleisenberg
make the visit? Together, they obsessively
recreate (and recreate and recreate) the
meeting.
The two physicists approach I leisenberg's
motivations scientifically while a skeptical
Margrethe observes. Did he come to probe

Bohr for secrets of the Allies' nuclear pro
gram? To warn Bohr about the German

atomic program? Margrethe attacks these
appeals to abstract, geo-political motiva
tions and suggests that his reasons were
purely personal: those ofan uncertain and
isolated young man seeking the approval
of his old mentor.
What is so gripping about the play is how
these men try to grapple with the awesome
power their science has unleashed: atomic
weapons. Their backgrounds have not given
them the toolstocome to grips with the moral
implications of that power. Physics was an in
tellectual game, carried out in cozy parlors
and in sec luded universities.
World War II changed everything for
them. Heisenljerg and Bohr both were bur
dened with the moral weight of their role in
the development of weapons of unprece
dented destructive power. Ironically, I leisen
berg, whose work led to the death of no one,
was reviled as a Nazi for the balance of his life,
while Bohr, whose work at Los Alamos con-
