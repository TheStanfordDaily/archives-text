# Editing services cause concern
## Increased use of online application essay services raises ethical issues 
### KRISTEN BELL 
Ihe increasingly competitive college admissions
process is driving high school students to new lengths,
such as high-priced personal counselors and schedules
packed with extracurriculars. But one trend, in partic
ular, is sparking worries among admissions officials ai
Stanford and nationwide — the use of online essay
editing services.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admission
and Financial Aid Robin Mantlet, although the Admis
sions Office does not "keep count of the number ofap

plications [ they J led have been 'supported' by . . . oth
ers .. .we are becoming increasingly concerned about
this."
Students at Stanford vary in their opinions about
whether 01 not the use of such services, such as Es
say, \dvice.com, VlyEssay.com, Ivy Essays.com and Es
say Edge.com, is fair.
Some students, like freshman I iancheng Zhu, think
that hiring a service to help with an admissions essay is
"outrageous.. . it's morally and ethically wrong."
()thei s, like freshman (>icely Smith, simply said they
think that using an editing service is "pathetic."
I he majority of students had qualms about the
use of a service because, as senior Luke Swart/, head
peer advising coordinator in
Granada, said, "Substantial edit
ing can rob the essay <>t the stu
dent's individual voice."
Another argument against on
line resources is their high cost.
Freshman Sara I lies (lalderon, who
said she was aware of the serv ices
but could not afford them, called
them "just another way of socio
economic discrimination."
Mamlet echoed this sentiment.
" 1 he use <)f'these services is <>bvi-
ously something that only some ap
plicants can afford, so ... there is a
fairness issue."
A few students compared essay
help sen ices to expensive SA I
preparation courses such as Prince
ton Review or Kaplan. Freshman
Mark Somers said the problem with
both types of services is that they
"only help privileged people."
Some students said the) see
nothing wrong with using online
services to help write college essays.
As long as editors do not write the
essay for the applicant, senior
Sarah Pond said she sees the ser
vice as a "resource, just like any
other resource."
Several students said that the use
of a service is justified for applicants
who do not have access to good col
lege counselors or teachers to give
them feedback.
Mamlet described both "a c lear

line" and"a more fuzzy one" with
respect to the ethical implic at ions of
editing services.
"Fhe clear line is that when a
piece of work ceases to be the indi
vidual student's exclusive!) in both
thought and word, it is an unethical
representation of who the person
is," she said. " Fhe fuzzy line is that
there is a difference between 'feed
back' and 'coaching.
judicial Affairs Advisen I .am cite
Beeson also stressed the impor
tant e of the degree of the editing.
"[An applicant | using words that
weren't his or her own would be vi
olating the honor code, she said.
I fowever, she noted that "feedback
is not necessaril) a violation . . . just
like writing tutors here at Stanford
can provide feedback."
Different editing companies —
many of which aggressively ret ruit
Stanford students to work as edi
tors — do in fact offer different lev
els of help.
I beset vices range from offering
basic tips, to proofreading, to pro
viding sentcncc-b)-sentence feed
back with suggested word changes.
Fhe full package that most com
panies offer involves having an edi
tor get to know the applic ant, sug
gest topics and assist in the outline
process, eventually editing the ap
plicant's work up to 30 times until
the desired essay is produceel.
Prices can range from $20 to
$400. and a < ouple of students said
that the big mone\ involved could
make working for the servic esan at
tractive proposition.

Mamlet, however, said she
hopes that "Stanford students so
licited to work for some of these ser
vices ... will (let ide to help college
applic ants in other, more appropri
ate, w.in s."
One senior who admitted to
working for one of the editing ser
vices said she is aware of the ethical
toneerns involved with the practice.
"I enjov helping prospec tivecol
lege students and finding out more
about them through the editing
process," she said, "However,
sometimes I wonder if what I'm
doing is really appropriate. Services
like these often significantly im
prove students' essays beyond their
own capabilities."
I he companies also sell sample
essass to help students get an idea
of what a "good" essay is. They
note however, that the essays are
mere examples and they clearly
state that plagiarism will have se
vere consequences,
Mamlet voiced concern about
applicants who "feel tliev need to
|nsr services | because their c lass
mates are doing so and they
don't want to be- disadvantaged
in the process."
Mamlet is also concerned about
"the message that applicants must
sureh absorb — that who they are
is not enough, that they must be
pac kagedand presented in order to
pass muster.
"Nothing could be further
from the case," she said. "It is the
genuine voices that stand out in
our process."
