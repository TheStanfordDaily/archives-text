University, former U.S. Treasury Secretarv I .aw rente
Summers has stirred up controversy with his call to
revise his institution's tenure policies.
Already, Summers has fielded accusations of age
discrimination for his denial of tenured professor
ships to two 54-year-old scholars, one of them from
Stanford. Summers has said he wants to focus on the
future, taking risks on younger candidates w hose best
work, he believes, lies ahead of them.
While Harvard's leaders are debating whether to
amend the school's tenure policies, Stanford adminis
trators assert that the University's tenure track is laii
and effective, and in fact serves as a model to which
Summers aspires.
"Do 1 think that Stanford's tenure policies should
be reformed?" Provost John Etchemend} said. "No,
we have excellent policies — which is why Summers
wants Harvard's to be more like ours."
Sharon Long, dean of the School of Humanities &
Sciences, emphasized that the Harvard and Stanford
systems are fundamentally different.
" I he Harvard system as it presently stands requires

a longer delay before the tenure de
cision," she said. " Tenure is con
ferred at the time that faculty are
promoted to lull professor. Here at
Stanford, tenure decisions are
made earlier than they are at Har
vard, so we already have the system
of looking at accomplishments of
younger faculty."
At Stanford, the tenure deci
sion is generally made by the sev
enth year of a faculty member's ap
pointment, usually at the time of
promotion to associate professor.
" There is a tenured position
available to every faculty member
appointed as assistant professor,
assuming they achieve that level of
distinction," said Patricia Jones,
Stanford's vice provost lor faculty
development.
"(Her the last 25 years, about 40

percent of the assistant professors
who come to Stanford earn tenure,
and of those for whom there is a
tenure decision [who choose to
stay at Stanford and undergo
tenure evaluation], 74 percent of
the faculty earned tenure," |ones
added.
Ktchemendy pointed to a lack
ol internal promotion within Har

"Virtualh no assistant profes
sors hired by I larvard end up get

tenured faculty at 1 larvard are ba
sically those who are hired from
the outside as senior faculty."
Summers told the Wall Street
)ournal that in tenure decisions he
will focus more on potential, giving
greater weight to the "career
stage" of professorial candidates.

said, "more skeptically at people
