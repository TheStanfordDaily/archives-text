This book is the first to examine the strange
and unprecedented events of the presidential
election of 2000-in all their complexity.
This election, which raised issues of balance
between parties, disturbing revelations about
how our votes are cast and counted and
illustrated the wisdom of a constitutional
system that allows the loser in the popular
vote to carry a majority of the presidential
electors, is commented on by some of '
America's leading historians, political scientists
and constitutional lawyers'. Together these
essays offer an election book very different
from the ones we are too familiar with: not a
journalistic account of campaigning and media
strategy, but a reflective assessment of the
strangest election in modern American history.
