When the Internet hurst on the
popular scene in the early 19905, its
advocates argued that it heralded a so
called virtual community that offered
rich new forms of human contact.
But two years ago, a Stanford Uni
versity political scientist, Norman H.
Nie, touched off a hitter dispute by re
porting that data from a big survey
indicated that the Internet was an iso
lating medium — that the more time
people spent using the Internet, the
less time they were likely to spend in
face-to-face human contact. Despite
his critics, who argued that Internet
interaction is its own form of human
contact, Mr. Nie is standing by his the
sis. In a chapter to appear in the com
ing book "The Internet in Everyday
Life," edited by Barry Wellman and
Caroline Haythornthwaite, Mr. Nie
and two of his colleagues, D. Sunshine
Hillygus and Lutz Ebring, report the
findings of a new survey of how 6,000
Americans spend their time each day.
The study concludes that Internet
use at home has a strong negative im
pact on time spent with friends and
family, while Internet use at work de
creases the time spent with colleagues.
