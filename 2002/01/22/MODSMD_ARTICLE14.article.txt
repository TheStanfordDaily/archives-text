# Enron examines document fiasco
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (Al>) — Enron is
looking into the reported destruc
tion of documents that allegedly
took plac eat its I louston headquar
ters after the federal government
began investigating the company,
an attorney for the bankrupt ener
gy giant said last night.
111 an on-air interview with AB( 1
News, a former Enron executive,
identified as Maureen Castaneda,
said the shredding of documents
took place in an accounting office
on the 19th floor.
Castaneda displayed one box
of the shredded material which "I
got . . . when I was leaving work
to basically use . . . for packing
material."
"There were ... a lot more
than this," she said, standing next
to the box. She said some of the
shredding may have occurred as
recently as this month.
Castaneda said the destruction
began after Thanksgiving and
continued to at least last week.
The Securities and Exchange
Commission began looking into
Enron in mid-C )c tober.
"We are investigating the cir
cumstances of the reported de
struction of documents," Wash

ington attorney Robert Bennett,
who is representing Enron, said in
a statement.
"In October 2001 the company
issued several directives to all
Enron employees worldwide that
all relevant documents should be
preserved in light of pending liti
gation," Bennett added. "II any
one violated those directives, they
will be dealt with appropriately."
Plaintiffs' attorney William Eer
ach, who is suing Enron's board
and officers, said he plans to take
the box of shredded documents to
federal court.
Enron's inquiry into shredding
at its headquarters came as con
gressional investigators pressed
for public testimony by an Ander
sen auditor fired over the destruc
tion at the accounting firm.
11 lis whole sorry "affair keeps
getting uglier by the minute, and
we're determined to get to the bot
tom of it," said Ken Johnson,
spokesman for the House Energy
and (Commerce (lommittee, which
has been investigating the destruc -
tion of documents at Andersen.
Fired Andersen auditor David
Duncan told investigators that An
dersen had ample information

when it evaluated the controver
sial partnership arrangements at
Enron that were a big factor in its
bankruptcy.
Dunean's lawyers sought to delay
his public testimony, scheduled for
rhursda\ before the House Over
sight and Investigations Subcom
mittee, arguing that Duncan needs
more time to prepare.
But (ireenwood, who chairs the
subcommittee, rejected the re
quest, sa\ ing Duncan "doesn't real
1\ need to recall every detail of what
he did for Enron. We're foe used on
the destruction of documents.
We'll subpoena him if we have to."
Appearing Sunda\ on NBC's
"Meet the Press. Andersen chief
executive Joseph Berardino said
Duncan displavcd "at the least . . .
extremeh poor Judgment " for his
part in discarding the documents
in October and November.
Meanwhile, a lawyer for Ken
neth E. Kay, Enron's chairman
and chief executive, said Kay dis
posed ol millions of dollars in
Enron stock before the company's
collapse last veai because he need
ed to raise cash to repa\ loans, not
because of concerns about the
health of his company.
