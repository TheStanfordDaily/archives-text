## The
						Stanford Daily Group's stance on cloning is commendable

Published Since 1891

112 m â€”lie California Advisory Committee
on Human Cloning recommended
last week that the state permit
JL therapeutic human cloning but
ban reproductive human cloning. We agree
with this view, which recognizes the power
of cloning to cure disease but also limits the
dangers that could come 112 rom misuse of the
technology.
Law Prof. Hank Greely wrote the com
mittee's report, which also called for state
regulation of therapeutic cloning to further
prevent abuses. I bis recommendation is
also commendable. If the legislature wrote a
law banning certain types of cloning, but
did not put any mechanisms in place to en
force it.the potential for abuse would be

enormous.
Therapeutic cloning is a term for all
cloning that does not involve actual human
reproduction. Embryonic stem-cell re
search is an example of this technology,
which has enormous potential to cure debil
itating diseases. Federal regulations
notwithstanding, it is in the interests of the
state to encourage research in and develop
ment of these technologies. All of humanity
will benefit from the potential cures.
Reproductive cloning, in contrast, occurs
when a new person is created from a living
person's cells, making an exact genetic copy
of the person. The prospect of cloned peo
ple is scary, with good reason. It is an un
natural process and brings up numerous

ethical and practical issues. For this reason,
the committee was right to recommend re
productive cloning be banned.
If adopted by the California Legislature,
these recommendations will have a practical
effect on research at Stanford. Many profes
sors at the School of Medicine are involved
in research that these policies will affect.
The Bio-X program, in particular, uses
stem-cell research extensively. A clear, fair
outline of acceptable policies will spur re
search, since uncertainty will be resolved.
I he committee also recommended that
the legislature monitor similar policies in
human biotechnology from other states and
the federal government. As well, it suggest
ed establishing a permanent mechanism to

advise the legislature and the governor in
these issues and developments. These too
are well-advised suggestions, since the tech
nology moves and develops very quickly.
California and its residents should not be
held hack by antiquated laws that do not ac
count for new technologies.
Last week, President George W. Bush
named Human Biology Prof. William Hurl
but to his council on bioethics, which will
grapple with the same issues as the Califor
nia commission. We urge Hurlbut and the
entire commission to read the California re
port, learn from it and emulate its recom
mendations on a national level. The Califor
nia group's suggestions are both enlight
ened and practical.
