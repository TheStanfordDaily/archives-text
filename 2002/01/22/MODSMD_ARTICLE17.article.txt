# PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY
## Being the music 
### 
From dreaming, I wake up. 1 lie
sun touches me. I feel energi/ed. I
breathe Ihe trees. I feel at home. I
drink some cool water. From dr\
.ind stale, I become lubricated and re
freshed.
1 pace mvself. Not too much move
ment. Not ready to breathe heavih yet.
Not too much sound. Still listening to
silent dreams, 100 much of almost any
thing and I will become grump\.
So: slow, please, I'm timing up. I'm
going to make music toda\.
I pace myself. I walk. Stretching out,
loosening up. From dream to ground. Fo
left from right. I'm finding the rhythm. 1
find it . . .
. . . and I begin gliding. From discrete
steps to a continuous flow.
I notice more rhvthms around me. The

rocking of the trees. I he |
zig-zag of an insect. I he
rapid hum of a mac lime.
The whish of a car. 1 he
bouncing of molec tiles |
against my skin (a slow
beat means "cold") I he |
frequencies of the sky.
These are the vibrations '
that c omprise the world

of my perception. I oda\ I find a harmon
ic collection. I his part of the country
makes some beautiful music!
(ilass. M\ professor speaks, emphasiz
ing and pausing in c larifying ways. He is
singing. I temporaril) don't understand
his harmony. I sing my own version of
what lie's saying, but I end with an lip
note, as il I'm waiting completion. I am a
question mark: raised shoulders, raised
evebrows, leaning forward. I'm waiting
for him to firing us back clown from m\ up
note and eventually back to the tonic
home note. When he does, I get a subtle
rush of relief, and I nod with a rhythm
and depth that says, " I hank you. I un
derstand." I le ends the lee lure on a con
cluding clown note. We close our note
hooks in applause.
I walk through a briar patch of other
people walking and hiking, each at differ
ent angles, speeds and awarenesses. If one
person were to direct all of our move
ments, many of us would crash, or not
move as quickly. But, when we fec i each
other, the most effective thing is anarchy.
If we expect the- other person to c hange
their dim tion and speed too nine h, or if
we change our own rhythm too unpre
dictably, we struggle with each other, and
we become trapped in the briar patch,
l oday, we don't dodge-. We harmonize.
1 stop to talk with a friend. She is beau
tiful. We make music. I sa\ something
brief. She says something longer, in her
higher octave. I say something brief again.
She says something brief. I listen to her, I
see her, I smell her. I feel the melody of
our conversation. Another friend grace
fully enters and pipes in. Wr more than

look at each others' eyes.
I walk back to m\ homeâ€”returning
my inusic to a tonic note. I eat. ()ne bite
at a time. I c hew, one chomp aftei .moth
er. 1 drink, one sip, then another. I he
come a rhythm.
I am a permanent flow. Within a couple
weeks. I will have entirely rebuilt niv skin.
Within about two months I will remake
m\ red blood cells. A few years from now,
I will finish completely reconstituting my
bones. Within a few more years, I w ill have
replaced the molecules that make up my
I)NA. I will eventually breathe, sweat,
poop and pee the contents of my body.
I am simph the information that di
rects this flow. I .mi the score.
Between the"in" and the "out" is the
energy that is me. Flunking, talking,
smelling, smiling. In between are the
movements that comprise niv day. Fhese
movements are the dance of my life.
Fhe day is getting warmer, and my
pace is getting faster. I decide to rush to
class because I want to finish composing
an e-mail, and I think 1 will enjoy the rush
ing of wind in m\ face and of blood in mv
muscles and gliding on m\ bike and hum
ming last music . . . and then sliding,
panting, into the c lassrooni.
I do this, and I enjoy it. There's some
thing profound about myself that I don't
really understand, but it's also something
I'm willing to accept without thinking
much: being alive feels good.
l oday 1 will learn to be more alive. I
read, and 1 learn. I talk with other people,
and I learn. I watch other people interact,
and I learn. I feel my body, my little sore
nesses and sadnesses, and I learn what I
can avoid doing again. I will learn to be
less stagnant, more alive.
I he discussion sec tion I attend is an op
portunity to improvise. I have the ability to
speak at any moment, but I choose to
speak when certain cues are right 1 (an let
m\ FA finish, or if it makes better music, I
can interrupt her when I don't under
stand. I can walk out anytime, but I leave
to go to the bathroom at a certain moment,
and with a certain, more harmonious
body language.
Kvery moment is another opportunity
for me to improvise. More than other or
ganisms or natural processes, I have the
ability toe liange my melody rapidly. Fike
a vocalist or a soloist in an orchestra, I
have leeway. I he sun, the plants, the in
sec is create the beat and underscore that
allows me to do some interesting things
on top. I can do a hand-stand right now.
I c an stop breathing fora few moments. I
can sit over there instead of here. It's not
all instinct.
It's especially interesting how I play
music with other humans. I low well do we
support each other? We spontaneously
create a soccer game before dinner. We
