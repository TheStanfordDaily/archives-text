Executive director of Student Housing
Services responds to column and letter
I am responding to misinformation in
letters last week in The Daily from law
student Rob Gaudet and alumnus
Winthrop Reis.
With regard to the allegations about
heat delivery in graduate housing, each tall
we monitor temperatures and listen to stu
dents to determine when to turn on the
heat svstemwide in student housing. This
year, we began turning on the heat ()< t. Hi
across the system, finishing all housing
shortly thereafter.
I his date actually was several days earli
er than it was in the previous year. A
group of senior operations managers in
Student Housing Services — including
Diana (ionklin — made the decision, as is
the case every year.
November ended up iM'ing one of
the mildest Novembers in recent years, so
there were few calls alxmt heat, whether too
little or too niuc h. Students call about Ih>tli
ends of the spectrum, depending on their
vary ing personal preferences and needs.
Our heating system is capable of maxi
mum temperatures during heat season
generally ranging from 70 to 78 degrees,
with variables such as outside temperature,
north-facing rooms, amount of glass in the
apartment and outside walls. Once turned
on throughout campus housing, the heat
stays on for the season.
According to the manager of housing
maintenance services, the volume of heat
related calls is a< tually lower this year than
last. When these tails are received, they are
a high priority for response. I his year's pro
cess for turning on the heat was smooth and
uneventful, and we have made no changes
in the way it was handled.
Contrary to the information in one letter
about no utility rate increases, in fiscal year
2001 we experienced a nearly 50 percent in
crease in natural gas and electricity costs.
This increase was comparable to the kinds
of rate increases felt by many businesses and

homes statewide. While these rates have
started to abate somewhat in recent months,
our costs remain high.
With respect to the assertion that housing
rates (>n campus are the same as local market
rates, campus housing rates during the
2000-01 academic year were actually be
tween 35 and 55 percent lower than the local
market across the board, according to list
ings taken by Community 1 lousing Services
and other local market data. In fact, campus
housing rates have been consistently 35 to 40
percent below market rates for at least the
past 10 years.
Despite the fact that rents in the off-cam
pus market have dropped markedly in the
economic downturn since Marc h 2001, on
campus rates remain at least 20 percent
below the off-campus market, and in most
cases, remain between 30 to 45 percent
below the market.
Conklin and her office staff have no
record of having received a message 112 rom
(iaudet. I lowever, as with any graduate stu
dent in housing with a concern, I encourage
him to contact her by telephone, e-mail, or
in person at the Kscondido Village Office.
I here is a great deal of irony involved
in the comments in both letters regarding
Conklin personally. She is a long-term,
loyal, and highly respected administrator
at the University and is one of the
strongest advocates of student concerns
and purveyors of excellent service to stu
dents in her work.
She has over 30 years of strong experi
ence, and acknowledged leadership in Res
idential Kducation, (udicial Affairs, and in
Undergraduate and Graduate Mousing
Services at Stanford.
In c losing, it is very unfair to attack Con
klin as these letters do for her role last (\ to
ber regarding the heat season issue. At that
time, she had recently returned to her posi
tion following a most unfortunate and dis
abling illness that allowed her to return at
only half-time in the Kail and precluded her
from even fx-ing involved in the kind of ac
tivities alleged in this letter.

Such remarks leveled against this valued
and taring Stanibrd manager are unkind
and unwarranted.
I hope this letter clarifies the mispercep
tions around these spec ific issues raised re
cently. Please be assured that all of us in
Student Housing Services remain fully
committed to providing outstanding and
responsive sen'ices to the nearly 1 1,000 stu
dents and families on campus.

Training table a good thing?
1 can understand why the athletic train
ing table at Stern Dining would inspire jeal
ousy, resentment and anger. However,
upon careful consideration of the issues,
one might realize that the training table is
actually appropriate and possibly even a
g<K)d tiling.
First, most people don't realize that Stan
ford is actually a professional sports organi
zation with a university attached to it. Sup
pose you attended a university affiliated
with the 49ers, or the Giants. Would you
complain if Barry Bonds got better food
than you did? ()f course not! Stanford is no
different.
Second, the large slices of meat reserved
for athletes are rich iti residual Bovine
(irowth I lormone and steroids which serve
to beef up cows the same way they do our
athletes.
I nless you want to look like an offensive
lineman, it would lx> wise to avoid them.
Stanford s serving of inferior-grade "mys
tery meat" to regular students serves a valu
able function in encouraging vegetarian
ism, which is more healthful, ethical and en
vironmentally responsible.
I' inally, in order to appreciate Stern I )in
ing, one should consider the perspective of
