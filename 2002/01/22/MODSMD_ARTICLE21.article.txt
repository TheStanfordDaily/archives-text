SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) — The kidnapping
and assassination of a leftist mayor has alarmed
Brazilians nationwide and prompted the president
to c all lor a war on crime.
Mayor (lelso Daniel of Santo Andre, an industri
al suburb, was found dead Sunday, shot several
times. I le was abducted 30 hours earlier.
Daniel's abduction was part of a rising wave of
kidnappings that authorities say is largely the work
of crime groups.
112 igures from the Sao Paulo State Security Bu
reau say that between 2000 and 2001, the number
of kidnappings soared by nearly 390 percent,
goingiiom 63 to 307. Fewer than 50 percent have
been solved.
"We need a war against organized crime, against
banditry in Brazil and against impunity," President
Fernando I lenrique Gardoso said Sunday.
As tens of thousands of mourners filed past
Daniel's coffin yesterday, Sao Paulo Gov. Gcraldo
AJckinin urged Brazil to raise the penalty for kid
napping from the current maximum 30 vears to life
imprisonment.
"We are fac ing a war and we will win it,"he said.
But yesterday, Amnesty International urged the
federal government to "fully investigate the possi
ble political motivations" for the recent shootings.
In September, gunmen shot and killed Mavor
Antonio da Gosta Santos of Gampinas, Sao Paulo
states second-largest city. Like Daniel, Santos was a
rising star in the leftist Workers Party. His killers
were never caught.

A month later, Geraldo Cruz, the Workers
Party mayor of the Sao Paulo suburb of Fmbu,
was injured In <1 homemade bomb t hat went off at
his house.
A previously unknown group calling itself the
Brazilian Revolutionary Action Front claimed re
sponsibility lor the killings and for death threats sent
to some 1-1 other members of the Workers Party.
In a note on its Web site, the group said it had
decided to attack those members of the Workers
Party who "have betrayed the people and allied
themselves .with right-wing Ibices."
I he government dosed down t lie Web site
yesterday.
Political violence in Brazil is almost unheard-of
since a I -year military dictatorship ended in 1985.
During the military years, the armed forces
crushed .1 rash of armed leftist groups.
But "organized crime has grown so much over
the past lew years (hat it has pushed Brazil danger
ously < lose to the situation currently being experi
enced In Colombia," said David Fleischer, an ana
lyst <it the I Diversity of Brasilia.
I le was referring to the drug lords and guerrilla
groups that for vears have undermined the Colom
bian government's authority.
Brazilian c rime gangs have grown with money
from drug trafficking, bank holdups and
ransoms — "the same way Colombian guerrillas
obtain funds." Fleischer said. I lie\ can afford to re
cruit the best criminals and keep them disciplined
and highly motivated, he said.
