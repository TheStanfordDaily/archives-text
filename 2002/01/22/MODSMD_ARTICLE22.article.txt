## Hoops sweeps Washington 
### AARON LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This was the momentum
builder they wanted.
It was the sweep they needed
to make.
And they had a little fun along
the way.
On Saturday night, throughout
the No. 17 Cardinal's 105-60 victo
ry over Washington, Maples Pavil
ion rang of old. It sounded ol
blowouts and good times, and it re
minded the Sixth Man Club that
the most satisfaction comes ( banti
ng "Down by forty."
With a crucial road trip to Los
Angeles on the horizon, it was an
appropriate time for the Cardi-

nal to tally its biggest win over
Washington in the series' 89-
year history.
"We know that it's going to get
tougher now, way tougher," coach
Mike Montgomery said. "I lopeful

was just one of those games where

a Barnes smile might be more com
mon off the floor, it was certainly

It happened with 13:45 left in
regulation. Off a Curtis Borchardt
block, Barnes weaved through
three defenders and sacrificed his
body to get a pass to Casey Jacob

flying into the photographers be

they pointed at each other with an
air of satisfaction.
And Barnes showed his teeth.
"I fieard Casey call my name,
so I knew it was him and that he
was in the corner," said Barnes,
who finished with 15 points and
five assists. "I sually, he doesn't
(all out his name unless lie's wide
open. I was hoping that he'd
knock it down and he did. It was a
tun play."
Jacobsen. who had a game
high 21 points, was thankful for
the assist.
"A wide-open three is some
thing that comes rare for me, and
I'm glad that Julius saw me. 1 hat
play is one I'm most grateful for,
and 1 let him know that I appreci
ated that play. Hopefully we can
get more of those in the future,"
Jacobsen said.
Barnes' smirk was the perfect
symbol of the entire series with the
Washington schools, which the
Cardinal (11-4, 4-2 Fat ifit 10C Con

ference) dominated, outscoring its
opponents 188-110 and gaining
pivotal victories in a conference
that is overflowing with parity.
Stanford still finds itself one
and-a-half games behind Fat-10
fronti turners Oregon and South
ern California ((*>-1).
I he 105 points were the most
Stanford has ever scored against
the Huskies, and the victory was
the Cardinal's fourth-largest win
over a Fat-10 school.
1 lie wide margin, combined
with urging from the Sixth Man
Club, even gave Montgomery the
incentive to put junior forward
1 yler Beset ker into the game.
Beset ker, who has sat out of
practice with a stress fracture for
the past month, drilled a three
w itli 2: 43 left to give Stanford <i 99-
55 lead and also tallied an two re
bounds and an assist.
"It was a lot offun just to see the
other guys that don't |>la\ as mut li
get in there and play, because I
know what that's like," Barnes
said. "It makes it even sweeter
when we're up by so main and not
have to worry about going bat kin
the game."

1 he was virtually over
by the time the "Urban Styles"
dancers came onto the court at
halitime anyway. A buzzer-beat
ing 3-pointer by senior Tony
(iiovacchini had given Stanford a
49-29 lead heading into the lock
er room.
I low good was tlie ('.ardinal? It
scored on I l-of-12 possessions at
one point in the second half, in
cluding a 3-pointer bv sopho
more Teyo Johnson that gave
Stanford a 74-36 lead. Johnson
scored 1 1 points.
Borchardt, who finished with
19 points and six rebounds,
scored the Cardinal's first six
points of the night and 13 of its
first 20 points.
Of course, the celebration after
the game only lasted so long, con
sidering what lies ahead for Stan
ford — t rips to I.A and Arizona.
"We have two of the hardest
two weekends in the Par-10 ahead
of us," (acobsen said. "[Next

Stanford still finds itself one

I he 105 points were the most
Stanford has ever scored against
the Huskies, and the victory was
the Cardinal's fourth-largest win
over a Fat-10 school.
1 lie wide margin, combined
with urging from the Sixth Man

incentive to put junior forward

"It was a lot offun just to see the

knock it down and he did. It was a
tun play."
Jacobsen. who had a game
high 21 points, was thankful for
the assist.
"A wide-open three is some
thing that comes rare for me, and
I'm glad that Julius saw me. 1 hat
play is one I'm most grateful for,
and 1 let him know that I appreci
ated that play. Hopefully we can
get more of those in the future,"
Jacobsen said.
Barnes' smirk was the perfect
symbol of the entire series with the
Washington schools, which the
Cardinal (11-4, 4-2 Fat ifit 10C Con

ference) dominated, outscoring its
opponents 188-110 and gaining
pivotal victories in a conference
that is overflowing with parity.
Stanford still finds itself one
and-a-half games behind Fat-10
fronti turners Oregon and South
ern California ((*>-1).
I he 105 points were the most
Stanford has ever scored against
the Huskies, and the victory was
the Cardinal's fourth-largest win
over a Fat-10 school.
1 lie wide margin, combined
with urging from the Sixth Man
Club, even gave Montgomery the
incentive to put junior forward
1 yler Beset ker into the game.
Beset ker, who has sat out of
practice with a stress fracture for
the past month, drilled a three
w itli 2: 43 left to give Stanford <i 99-
55 lead and also tallied an two re
bounds and an assist.
"It was a lot offun just to see the
other guys that don't |>la\ as mut li
get in there and play, because I
know what that's like," Barnes
said. "It makes it even sweeter
when we're up by so main and not
have to worry about going bat kin
the game."

1 he was virtually over
by the time the "Urban Styles"
dancers came onto the court at
halitime anyway. A buzzer-beat
ing 3-pointer by senior Tony
(iiovacchini had given Stanford a
49-29 lead heading into the lock
er room.
I low good was tlie ('.ardinal? It
scored on I l-of-12 possessions at
one point in the second half, in
cluding a 3-pointer bv sopho
more Teyo Johnson that gave
Stanford a 74-36 lead. Johnson
scored 1 1 points.
Borchardt, who finished with
19 points and six rebounds,
scored the Cardinal's first six
points of the night and 13 of its
first 20 points.
Of course, the celebration after
the game only lasted so long, con
sidering what lies ahead for Stan
ford — t rips to I.A and Arizona.
"We have two of the hardest
two weekends in the Par-10 ahead
of us," (acobsen said. "[Next
week | is going to be a weekend
that not many teams are going to
get wins at.
"To get a couple there would
| >ut us light back at the top of the

Pac-10. lt d be really important to
establish ourselves and to forget
about everything that's happened
this year."
