# Men return to past dominating form

### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
Almost immediately after the final buzzer sounded
on Saturday night, junior center (lurtis Borchardt was
back in the locker room — his feet submerged in a
cooler full of freezing ice water and ice bags wrapped
tightly around both knees.
For (lurtis this post game ritual is just as important
as pregame warmups if he wants to survive what's left
of this physically demanding collegiate season.
But on Saturday against Washington, Bor
chardt got to begin his post game ritual a little ear
lier than usual.
With 14 minutes remaining in the second half Bor
chardt was replaced by sophomoreTeyo Johnson and
enjoyed a standing ovation from Stanford fans.

Bon li;ii (It finished the game with 19 points, six re
bounds and two blocked shots in only 23 minutes of
play, 112 ifteen of his points came in the first half and he
stored the Cardinal's first six points, en route to the
team's 45 point win.
Stanford, simply put, got off to a good start offen
siveh against Washington. Junior Julius Barnes, Bor
cliardt and junior Casey Jacobsen finished the first
half in double figures, which allowed for early substi
tution and got both Jacobsen and Borchardt some
much needed rest.
"I really do have to take care of my body," Bor
chardt said. "When we get up like this I expect to be
taken out, not only for my health but for the rest of my
teammates. I hey deserve to be playing and they did a
great job."
When tht' starters go in and
take care of the game early — like
they are expected to and capable
of— the second string (especially
the freshmen) get a chance to
come in and become more com
fortable offensively.
"Substituting off the bench we
brought guys in that are learning
and trying to play," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "It's im
portant to them and it's important
to us that they do learn how to play
and give us good minutes."
I his is the (lardinal that should
have been seen all along. It's this
type of team that is able to be com
petitive in the Pac-10 — a team
that can open a game hungry and
take care of business early.
It really makes things a lot easi
er on everyone involved. This i»>
the way Stanford should have
plavecl against California and the
()regon teams.
lint what happened instead?
Against Cal, Stanford shot a
season-low 32 percent from the
field in the first half, giving the
(iolclen Bears an unwarranted
sense ol confidence heading into
the second. A slow start led to a
bad ending.
In Oregon, |acobsen and Bor
chardi put up career-high num
bers but didn't have a supporting
cast, resulting in an unforeseen

loss to the Ducks.
And at Oregon State, Casey
picked up a couple of question
able fouls early and had to rest at
the beginning ol the game
rather than at the end, allowing
a team like the Beavers to hang
around, turning what should
have been a dominating victory
into a so-so night.
Now it's true, neither Washing
ton team posed any real threat to
the Cardinal. Neither team was of
the caliber of Cal or ()regon.
I lowever, in the last two games,
everyone got to see a glimpse of
what Stanford is capable 01. Ihe
games acted as a reminder to
everyone (including the players)
that Stanford is still a top-20 team,
despite recent stumbles and that
the Cardinal still maintains the
ability to dominate.
In fact, the wins against the
Washington schools couldn't have
come at a better time.
I lie two victories this past week
allowed the Cardinal to regain
some confidence and become a lit
tle bit more comfortable offensive
ly as it heads into the two of the
most important and difficult weeks
of the I'ac -10 season to date.
In the next 1 1 days Stanford
will face No. 9 UCLA, No. 18USC
and No. 15 Arizona, who sit atop
the conference standings.
Bui Curtis will have to keep his
leet in that freezing ice water and
take care of those knees. It's going
to be a long week. Don't expect to
exit a game against UCLA or I SC
with 14 minutes left to play.

chardt said. "When we get up like this I expect to be
taken out, not only for my health but for the rest of my
teammates. I hey deserve to be playing and they did a
great job."
When tht' starters go in and
take care of the game early — like
they are expected to and capable
of— the second string (especially
the freshmen) get a chance to
come in and become more com
fortable offensively.
"Substituting off the bench we
brought guys in that are learning
and trying to play," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "It's im
portant to them and it's important
to us that they do learn how to play
and give us good minutes."
I his is the (lardinal that should
have been seen all along. It's this
type of team that is able to be com
petitive in the Pac-10 — a team
that can open a game hungry and
take care of business early.
It really makes things a lot easi
er on everyone involved. This i»>
the way Stanford should have
plavecl against California and the
()regon teams.
lint what happened instead?
Against Cal, Stanford shot a
season-low 32 percent from the
field in the first half, giving the
(iolclen Bears an unwarranted
sense ol confidence heading into
the second. A slow start led to a
bad ending.
In Oregon, |acobsen and Bor
chardi put up career-high num
bers but didn't have a supporting
cast, resulting in an unforeseen

loss to the Ducks.
And at Oregon State, Casey
picked up a couple of question
able fouls early and had to rest at
the beginning ol the game
rather than at the end, allowing
a team like the Beavers to hang
around, turning what should
have been a dominating victory
into a so-so night.
Now it's true, neither Washing
ton team posed any real threat to
the Cardinal. Neither team was of
the caliber of Cal or ()regon.
I lowever, in the last two games,
everyone got to see a glimpse of
what Stanford is capable 01. Ihe
games acted as a reminder to
everyone (including the players)
that Stanford is still a top-20 team,
despite recent stumbles and that
the Cardinal still maintains the
ability to dominate.
In fact, the wins against the
Washington schools couldn't have
come at a better time.
I lie two victories this past week
allowed the Cardinal to regain
some confidence and become a lit
tle bit more comfortable offensive
ly as it heads into the two of the
most important and difficult weeks
of the I'ac -10 season to date.
In the next 1 1 days Stanford
will face No. 9 UCLA, No. 18USC
and No. 15 Arizona, who sit atop
the conference standings.
Bui Curtis will have to keep his
leet in that freezing ice water and
take care of those knees. It's going
to be a long week. Don't expect to
exit a game against UCLA or I SC
with 14 minutes left to play.
