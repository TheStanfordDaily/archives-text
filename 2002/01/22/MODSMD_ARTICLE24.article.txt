# Tennis makes strong showing in Vegas

Even at an individually based tournament like
the National Collegiate Tennis Classic, the No. 2
Stanford men's tennis team was able to learn a lot
about itself as a unit. Most of it good.
In fact, if it weren't for Rodrigo Grilli of UCLA,
the Cardinal would have captured the singles, dou
bles and consolation titlesat one of the strongest In
tercollegiate Tennis Association-sanctioned tour
naments of the year.
In the singles final on Sunday in Las Vegas, (iril
li won the title in his first tournament competing as
a Bruin, by defeating 49th-ranked Stanford junior
David Martin, 6-4, 7-5.
Martin, however, made a statement for himself
earlier by stunning UCLA's 18th-ranked Jean
julien Rojer, 6-0, 6-3, in the quarterfinals.
()n Saturday, the experienced third-ranked duo
of Martin and fellow junior Scott Lipsky (9-2) con
tinued to establish its reputation as one of the best
doubles tandems in the nation by knocking off the
top-ranked UCLA pair of Rojer and Martin
Matkowski 9-8 (7).
To round out the Cardinal accolades, freshman
Phil Sheng (3-3) defeated fellow freshman team
mate No. 90 Sam Warburg (7-5) in three sets, 3-6,
7-5, 6-3, to take the singles consolation title.
Head coach Dick Gould was extremely pleased
with the team's performance.

"We needed good matches, and the tournament
provided them," he said. "It was a great way to get
our focus back for the winter season and particu
larly, to help prepare us fora good San Diego State
team, and in turn, the very important Indoor Team
Championship. We emerged healthy, and we are
off and running."
Martin believed that the trip allowed the team
to know itself better before its first dual match of
the season.
"It was good for all of us to hang out together in
one place fora few days in a row." he said. "I feel
good about our team. I feel like we have a lot of po
tential, but rffiaximizing that potential is what we'll
be working towards all season long.'
Also positive for the Cardinal was the fact that
the squad accomplished all this without its seniot
leader K.J. Ilippensteel (6-0) â€” who played at a
Challenger professional event in Hawaii this past
weekend.
While the upside of such a successful weekend is
evident, it makes it difficult for (lould to make deci
sions regarding the starting lineup for the Cardi
nal's first dual match, against feisty 53rd-ranked
San Diego State on Feb. 2.
The only "no-brainer" is the No. 1 singles spot,
which the top-ranked I lippensteel has earned with
his extensive experience, if not for his skills as an all
court tennis player.
