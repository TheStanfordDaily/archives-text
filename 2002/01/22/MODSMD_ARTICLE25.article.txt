Washington State.
"Cori did a great job for us," YanDerveer said.
"She really stepped up big. She was huge tonight and
she had a monster game against Washington State."
With Enghusen's play inside, the Cardinal is devel
oping incredible depth at every position.
"She has really come into her own at the right time
when we really needed her," YanDerveer said. "She's
been running the floor and making her free throws
and really doing everything we've needed her to do."
However. Enghusen hasn't played main minutes
this season because of foul trouble. On Saturday, she
added four fouls to her other high numbers.
Sophomore Nicole Powell continued to contribute
in every hue) of the game. While
she only scored eight points, she
led the team with 12 rebounds and
six assists.
Powell, last week's Pac-10
player of the week, has con

tributed in different ways every
game. Last week, she had a
triple- double in one game, and
then followed it up with a 21-re
bound performance. Against
Washington State on Thursday,
she didn't score double-digits,
but added 10 assists, setting up
her teammates.
Freshman Kelley Suminski also
played well against the Huskies,

contributing 10 points. Suminski
played 35 minutes as she continues
to develop into a full-time starter.
Suminski, Yamasaki and Powell
all played over 30 minutes, as eight
players saw more than 10 minutes
of action.
l he team's I<S-1 start is its best
since the 1996-1997 season, when
the Cardinal finished the regular
season at 30-1.
