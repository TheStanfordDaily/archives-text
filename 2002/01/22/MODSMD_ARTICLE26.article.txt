# Card Baseball: fans wanted
## Baseball looks to draw more fans to Sunken Diamond this season 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
1 low many consecutive trips to
the College World Series does it
take for Stanford students to
come out to Sunken Diamond the
following season?
Stanford baseball's marketing
department is banking on three.
For the upcoming 2002 base
ball season, which for the unani
mously top-ranked Cardinal be
gins Feb. 1 at home against No.
15 Cal-State Fullerton, Sunken
Diamond will see a minor but sig
nificant improvement to its seat
ing system.
"A number of students wrote
to us during the off-season asking
about student seating, and we
talked it over to come up with a
solution that would accommo
date them," said Josh 1 hiel, Mar
keting Director for Stanford
baseball.
Prior to each 2002 home
game, ushers will rope off a 40-
seat student section on the left
side of home plate in order to

bring more excitement to the
ballpark and to entourage
more students to catch one of
the school's most consistent
winners over the past two
dec ades. I bat number will fluc
tuate based on anticipated in
terest in each contest and spe
cial promotions.
It's not the Sixth Man Club,
but it is certainly a step in the
right direction fora program that
would thrive even more than it al
ready does with increased stu
dent support.
The new section is not the
only step the team has taken for
2002 to heighten the student
presence at what traditionally
have been community-attended
events. ()ne-quarter of Cardinal
home games, totaling seven in
all, will be deemed student dis
count games that allow students
to enter for half price, one dol
lar or free, depending on the
day. In addition, the ticket of
fice will continue to accept the
Athletic Department's "Whole
Enchilada" plan or the $20
baseball student season ticket at
the gates.
The first discounted ballgame
will be former Cardinal assistant
Mark O'Brien's first time at
Sunken Diamond in the visitor's
dugout, as lie brings his Santa
Clara squad on Friday, Feb. 22.
Two other marquee discount
events are Saturday matinee con
tests against Texas (Mar. 30) and
California (May 4).
While the new seating
arrangements should attract
more students than ever before to
the ballpark, they will not be able
to linger at their leisure. One
hour prior to the game's first
pitch, the roped-oil' section will
become part of the Gfcneral Ad
mission section, to which they be
longed in past seasons.
After two straight campaigns
<is national runner-up and the in
troduction of student-friendly
promotions, perhaps Stanford
baseball will no longer be the
best-kept secret on campus.

Despite being one of the most successful teams on the Farm in recent years, the baseball team has not drawn a large
number of students to Sunken Diamond. New seating arrangements may improve student numbers this season.
