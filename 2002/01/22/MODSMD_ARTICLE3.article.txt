# Construction projects on time, budget
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite obstacles posed by a change in fund
ing and poor weather, two of Stanford's biggest
construction projects, the James H. Clark Cen
ter for Biomedical Engineering and Sciences
and the Allene C. Vaden Health Center, are
both progressing on budget and on time.
The $138-million Clark Center, the core of
Stanford's new Bio-X Program for Bioengi
neering, Bioinedicine and Biosciences, is
scheduled to be completed in May 2003, and
the $9.(>million Vaden Health Center is slated
to be ready in June and will be open for the
2002-2003 academic year.
Clark Center construction is currently fo
cused on the shell and the core of the building,
according to Assoc. Vice Provost of Land and
Buildings Langston I rigg.

"Construction is about 20 percent com
plete," he said.
Trigg added that the current expected com
pletion date is essentially the same as was ini
tially planned.
Several months ago, Netscape co-founder
Jim ('.lark's decision to withhold $00 million of
the $150 million he pledged to fund the
launching of the Bio-X project raised concerns
that the construction would be delayed.
Clark announced his decision at the end of
August in protest of President Bush's decision
to strictly limit federal funding for embryonic
stem cell research. I he Clark ('.enter and Bio-X
project will be undertaking interdisciplinary
biomedical research, including stem cell re
search.
However, according to Vice President of De
velopment John Ford, (Mark's decision has had
no impact on the actual construction of the

Clark Center.
" The funding lie's withholding was going to
be used for permanent programs," Ford said.
"Mr. Clark has made.his payments that go di
rectly to the construction of the building."
Ford said that of the $150 million Clark had
initially pledged, $70 million was slated to go
specifically toward the construction of the
building and another $20 million was to be
used for start-up costs for the building, such as
purchasing equipment.
Both Ford and Trigg said they were confi
dent that the University would be able to gen
erate alternate ways to raise the money neces
sary to fund Bio-X programming, such as addi
tional donations or University funds.
Thus far, any deviations from the initial de
sign ol the (Mark Center have not affected ex
penditures.
"We had to make some changes to the exte
rior of the building so that it lit into the campus
feel, but we were able to do that within budget,"
said frigg.
According to Ford, construction is going bet
ter than expected.
"As far as I know we're actually under bud
get on the building project and we're definitely
on schedule," lie said.
The Vaden Health Center, which will re
place the 30-year-old Cowell Health (".enter, is
currently more than halfway through the first
phase of construction. Contractors are current
ly working on the roof and exterior closure of
the building.
After two studies in 1997 and 1999 demon
strated that the design of Cowell was not satis
fying functional needs and that expensive ren
ovations were required to satisfy' seismic retro
fit standards, the I Diversity decided to instead
build a new health center.
Financed by a gift from Val Vaden and
funds from the Cowell Health Center, the new
health center will be essentially the same si/e
but will be designed to meet the needs of a stu
dent health center.
"The original building was a completely dif
ferent type of clinic," said Project Manager
Cina (loony, noting that exam rooms were half

the si/e needed, but that rooms on
the second floor had excess space.
('owell was not initially intended to
serve as a clinic like it does now.
"We were 30 percent short of
reaching our functional space and
needs."
Phase one of the project is the
construction of the new health
center and phase two will be the
demolition of C'.owell, slated for
this summer.
"We're about 60 percent along
in phase one," (loony said.
Coony said the ( '.owell staff will

most likely move into the Vaden
Health Center right after gradua
tion in June. However, Coony
noted, since it will not need to be
open until September when stu
dents return to c ampus, they have
some leeway.
The December rain may have
set the project back a bit. Coony
said, but by no more than a week.
Otherwise, Coony said the project,
is progressing ac cording to plan.
Coony added that, to date,
there have not been any budget
issues.
"We're on budget; it's a tight
budget, and we're working very
diligently toward it, Coony said,
referring to the project's $9.6-mil
lion cost.

launching of the Bio-X project raised concerns
that the construction would be delayed.
Clark announced his decision at the end of
August in protest of President Bush's decision
to strictly limit federal funding for embryonic
stem cell research. I he Clark ('.enter and Bio-X
project will be undertaking interdisciplinary
biomedical research, including stem cell re
search.
However, according to Vice President of De
velopment John Ford, (Mark's decision has had
no impact on the actual construction of the

Clark Center.
" The funding lie's withholding was going to
be used for permanent programs," Ford said.
"Mr. Clark has made.his payments that go di
rectly to the construction of the building."
Ford said that of the $150 million Clark had
initially pledged, $70 million was slated to go
specifically toward the construction of the
building and another $20 million was to be
used for start-up costs for the building, such as
purchasing equipment.
Both Ford and Trigg said they were confi
dent that the University would be able to gen
erate alternate ways to raise the money neces
sary to fund Bio-X programming, such as addi
tional donations or University funds.
Thus far, any deviations from the initial de
sign ol the (Mark Center have not affected ex
penditures.
"We had to make some changes to the exte
rior of the building so that it lit into the campus
feel, but we were able to do that within budget,"
said frigg.
According to Ford, construction is going bet
ter than expected.
"As far as I know we're actually under bud
get on the building project and we're definitely
on schedule," lie said.
The Vaden Health Center, which will re
place the 30-year-old Cowell Health (".enter, is
currently more than halfway through the first
phase of construction. Contractors are current
ly working on the roof and exterior closure of
the building.
After two studies in 1997 and 1999 demon
strated that the design of Cowell was not satis
fying functional needs and that expensive ren
ovations were required to satisfy' seismic retro
fit standards, the I Diversity decided to instead
build a new health center.
Financed by a gift from Val Vaden and
funds from the Cowell Health Center, the new
health center will be essentially the same si/e
but will be designed to meet the needs of a stu
dent health center.
"The original building was a completely dif
ferent type of clinic," said Project Manager
Cina (loony, noting that exam rooms were half

the si/e needed, but that rooms on
the second floor had excess space.
('owell was not initially intended to
serve as a clinic like it does now.
"We were 30 percent short of
reaching our functional space and
needs."
Phase one of the project is the
construction of the new health
center and phase two will be the
demolition of C'.owell, slated for
this summer.
"We're about 60 percent along
in phase one," (loony said.
Coony said the ( '.owell staff will

most likely move into the Vaden
Health Center right after gradua
tion in June. However, Coony
noted, since it will not need to be
open until September when stu
dents return to c ampus, they have
some leeway.
The December rain may have
set the project back a bit. Coony
said, but by no more than a week.
Otherwise, Coony said the project,
is progressing ac cording to plan.
Coony added that, to date,
there have not been any budget
issues.
"We're on budget; it's a tight
budget, and we're working very
diligently toward it, Coony said,
referring to the project's $9.6-mil
lion cost.
Despite obstacles posed by a change in fund
ing and poor weather, two of Stanford's biggest
construction projects, the James H. Clark Cen
ter for Biomedical Engineering and Sciences
and the Allene C. Vaden Health Center, are
both progressing on budget and on time.
The $138-million Clark Center, the core of
Stanford's new Bio-X Program for Bioengi
neering, Bioinedicine and Biosciences, is
scheduled to be completed in May 2003, and
the $9.(>million Vaden Health Center is slated
to be ready in June and will be open for the
2002-2003 academic year.
Clark Center construction is currently fo
cused on the shell and the core of the building,
according to Assoc. Vice Provost of Land and
Buildings Langston I rigg.

"Construction is about 20 percent com
plete," he said.
Trigg added that the current expected com
pletion date is essentially the same as was ini
tially planned.
