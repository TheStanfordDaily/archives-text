### SHANNA MCCORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
fhe "working tradition" ap
pears to be waning at prestigious
business schools nationwide, in
cluding Stanford's Graduate
School of Business, as many top
programs have begun to admit
some students straight from un
dergraduate institutions.
While resumes and experience
have been a major determinant
surrounding entrance qualifica
tions, the trend has turned toward
accepting younger, less experi
enced students at business schools
including Stanford, Harvard and
The University of Pennsylvania.
According to Derrick Bolton,
Stanford's Business School ad
missions director, admissions are
determined on a "case-by-case"
basis.
"Some folks in college have
done some ama/ing things,"
Bolton said. "They have incredi
bly impressive backgrounds."
Stanford's Business School ad
missions criteria have not
changed much over the years,
Bolton said. Most importantly,
professors and administrators
seek candidates who have proven
their academic aptitude, demon
strated potential managerial skills

and add diversity to the class.
Bolton said that undergradu
ates who believe that the) meet
those requirements are encour
aged to apply.
" There are a very small num
ber ready right after college,"
Bolton said. "All we're saying is
that we're flexible."
Still, the admission of an un
dergraduate applicant to the
Business School remains extreme
ly rare. According to Bolton, the
class 0f2003 has "a couple" of stu
dents who came straight from un
dergraduate studies, a number
that adds up to only one percent
of the total class.
Twenty-one year old Dan
Krause is among those "couple" of
students: having graduated from
Boston University only eight
months ago, he is now the
youngest student at the Business
School.
Krause's resume boasts sub
stantive summer internships with
National Airlines, a small carrier
based in Las Vegas. He was a man
agement intern during the sum
mer of 2000, while the following
summer Krause interned with the
sales and marketing department
of the airline.
Some Business School students
who spent significant time work
ing after college and before apply
ing for an MBA said that their
"real-world" experiences have
proven to be vital elements of
their graduate education.
First-year Business School stu
dents Amit Jain, Shai Fischer and
Vic Bhatia are considered more
typical MBA candidates: together,
(hey bring to the classroom more
than 15 years of work experience.
Jain spent three years working
(>() hours per week as a telecom
munications consultant in Wash
ington, n.C. Fischer served in
the Israeli Army, while Bhatia
held a high-pressure consulting
position with Boston Consulting
Croup in Dallas.

The three agreed that without
those experiences, class discus
sions would lose their luster.
"Conversations in c lass are def
initely enriched by what people
did before," Jain said.
Business School Admissions l)i
-rec tor Bolton conceded that work
experience brings a certain level
of maturity, definition of goals
and fidelity of purpose that is hard
to come by with the majority of
new college graduates.
"For the vast majority interest
ed in business school, they should
work before," Bolton said.

Jain, Fischer and Bhatia are
among a c lass of 360 students in
which admission was offered to
only S.B percent of those who ap
plied. More than half of the class
0f2003 comes from ;i background
in management consulting, Inter
net services, banking, venture
capital or private equitv.
Others include a student who
has played professional football, a
world class 400-meter runner,

class," Bhatia said.
