# New ME laboratory close to completion
## The 						$25 million building includes facilities for propulsion science 
### ANTHONY HA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's new mechanical en
gineering laboratory is nearing
completion, according to Assoc.
Vice Provost of Land and Build
ings Langston Trigg.
"[The lab] should open literal
ly any day now," Trigg said.
" They've been putting the finish
ing touches on it.and it's just
been completed."
Trigg pegged the costs of con

struction, which began in June
2000, at $25 million. This figure
includes both the building of the
laboratory and other spin-off
projects, some of which have al
ready taken place.
The Press Warehouse build
ing was demolished a year and a
half ago, and work on Building 2-
570, which includes seismic
retrofitting, will be complete in
August 2002.
The construction site current

tion in December 2001, while

Trigg claimed that there have
been no delays.
"It's on budget and on sched
ule," he said.
According to I'rot. Ronald K.
Hanson, chairman of the depart
ment of mechanical engineering,
the project began when the Uni
versity tried to seismic ally upgrade
two mechanical engineering build
ings following the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 1989.
"We quickly learned that this
would be very costly and not pro

duce the desired high-quality re
search space needed for our de
partment's future," he said.
"Fortunately, the [then-]dean,
John Hennessy, and [Ilien-
] provost, Condoleeza Rice, dec id
ed that the best strategy for our fu
ture would be to invest in a new re
search facility which could both
house the displaced research activ
ities and also enable our depart
ment to position itself for the fu
ture," he said.
1 fanson also said the Universi
ty employed a new approach to
the design and construction of
the laboratory by involving a
committee of four faculty mem
bers in the process.
"We have had input [into] the

space allocations for each of the
several planned uses," lit- said.
"[We] have [also] met continuous
ly with the project managers to
continue to improve the design
and to make decisions on various
trade-offs for improving the final
design subject to strict budgetary
constraints."
"My sense is that the project
managers from the I niversity and
the School of Engineering, and the
ME faculty, are really pleased with
the way that we have been able to
refine the design as we went
along," he added. " I his is much
better than simply letting someone
else try to design the space and
hoping that they can anticipate
our real needs."

According to Hanson, the two
story, 48,000-square-foot building
will include facilities for research in
combustion and propulsion sci
ence, robotics and controls, biome
chanical engineering and mi
croscale engineering.
()ther facilities will include space
fora teaching lab for internal com
bustion engines and automotive
controls, undergraduate research
and project-based instruction.
Space has been reserved fora
yet-to-be-defmed future thrust,
expected to involve nanosystems
engineering and bioengineering.
Portions of the building were
specially built to allow experi
ments involving toxic and flam
mable gases.
