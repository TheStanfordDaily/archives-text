# Canadian television star doubles as student
## 
### HELEN KIM 
While Stanford's student body
has seen its fair share of renowned
actors, political scions and athletes,
many may not know that one c ur
rent student has starred in a televi
sion series north of the border â€”
FLiCKS project manager KyleAl
isharan of Canada.
A 23-year-old senior majoring
in English and minoring in Com
puter Science, Alisharan started
acting in Vancouver at the age of
six when his parents decided to
enroll him and his brother in a
drama academy.
A couple of years later, lie went
to the Trinity College in London
and the Vancouver Youth I he
ater. In his early teens, Alisharan
and his brother were approached
by agents and their acting careers

took off.
"I'm definitely not a celebrity,"
he said. "People occasionally rec
ognize me, but there's no st ream
ing or underwear throwing. Kvery
now and then, I get e-mail from
40-year-old men, but it's nothing
extreme."
Most famous for bis role in the
Canadian television series "Break
er High," a "Saved by the Bell"-
type high school sitcom, Alisharan
has appeared in small roles on
Fox's "Dark Angel" and "Sliders"
and the Nickelodeon show "Are
You Afraid of the Dark?"
Alisharan said he is lx\st known
for playing the role of the confused
boyfriend.
"After we did 44 episodes over
eight months lor 'Breaker High,'
we moved to Los Angeles fora
while, and I was an actor there," he

said. "Since then, I've decided I
wanted to come back to school. I
try not to audition while I'm here
because I don't want to take ;uiy
more time oft. But in the summers,
I audition."
Although most of his back
ground is in the world of acting, Al
isharan said he plans to become in

volved in the business side of the
entertainment industry while
using his knowledge of computer
science. His job as FLiCKS project
manager entails much of the en
trepreneur-like lift- that lie expects
to live.

Alisharan is responsible for
overseeing all FLiCKS-related
tasks, such as contracts, booking
films and managing ticket sales.
"The responsibilities don't
seem like much when you list
them, but FLiCKS includes a lot of
crisis management," Alisharan
said. "It's like running a real busi
ness, a small movie theater."
Last quarter, there was an inci
dent in which one of the movies on
the roster, "The Rocky 1 lorror Pic
ture Show," had to be pulled due
to a conflict with the distributor.
"To compensate, we showed a
free double feature that night and
gave all passholders [discount
coupons]," he said. "We also turned
around and sued the distributor."
Because of the responsibility of
being project manager, Alisharan
said he feels much pressure.
" There's definitely the pressure
of trying to account for all the small
things, which is impossible," he
said. "After 'The Rocky Horror
Picture Show' incident, 1 got e
mails in my personal account.

"Everyone knows that FLU IKS
is student-run, but I'd make it into
a professional movie experience
with some fun."
On top of his FLiCKS and act
ing commitments, Alisharan also
said he feels the pressures of any

normal Stanford student.
"When I'm acting and people
asked me what my tiling' is, 1 tell
them I'm a Stanford student. But
when I'm at Stanford, I tell people
(licit I'm an actor. You sort of want
to distinguish yourself .''
