### ERIN ARCHERD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lii an address last night titled
"Mandela, Reconciliation and
Shakespeare," Anthony Sampson,
author ol Nelson Mandela's autho
rized biography, discussed the life
and impact of the lornier South
African president. Sampson re
flected upon the development of
Mandela from the son of a minor
tribesman to a major world leader.
Sampson began by emphasizing
the broader cultural context of
Mandela's story. He spoke about
Mandela's education — he did not
excel as a student but worked hard
to learn law — and his charisma.
"Charisma is a dangerous phe
nomenon," Sampson said.

However, he qualified Man
dela's charisma as an attribute that
sprang from his deep personal in
tegrity and his ability to bring peo
ple together.
"True charisma is quite differ
ent from dazzle," he said. "It is a
warm and lasting light which can
bring opponents closer together in
thinking."
Sampson first met Mandela in a
speakeas\ in 1951 when Sampson,
recently graduated from Oxford
with a degree in Knglish literature,
moved to Johannesburg to edit a
new black magazine called Drum.
I bis experience exposed liiin to
many young black writers and po
litical figures. Sampson noted that
iliev knew Shakespeare "much
more seriously" than he did.
" I hey saw it as the handbook of
revolution," he said before the lec
ture.
Sampson likened the black cul
ture of Johannesburg to the
Harlem Renaissance of tlie 19205,

calling it "an extraordinary place of
confluence between two cultures."
112 lis first impressions of Mandela
were not of a great political leader.
"He was too much the show
man. too arrogant . ... He was
headstrong and rash," Sampson
said.
Mandela's abilities as a leader
were confirmed by the second of
two speeches he delivered shortly
before going to prison.
"It revealed the extent of his de
velopment at an individual,"
Sampson said.
To Sampson, Mandela's '27
years in prison were the most inter
esting of Mandela's life.
"It was essentially a universal ex
perience," he said. "I lis true sense
of leadership was distilled."
It was in prison that Mandela
developed his ability to persuade
and recognize the position of oth
ers, Sampson said. Over the years,
