JERUSALEM (AT) â€” A Palestin
ian gunman opened lire on Israelis
waiting at a Ims stop in the heart of
Jerusalem ancl wounded lb people
yesterday, hours after Israeli com
mandos stormed an explosives lab
and killed four Islamic militants in the
West Bank, llie violence provoked
outrage and warnings of retaliation
on both sides.
Mideast tensions are again surg
ing after several weeks of relative
calm, with the Israelis effectively
keeping Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat under house arrest at his West
Bank government compound, and
militant Palestinians abandoning an
informal truce.
"You can certainly expect an Is

Palestinian Cabinet secretary, said Is

Jerusalem police chief Mickey Levy.
Sixteen people were shot, with six
of them seriously wounded. In addi

the group said.
Meanwhile, the recent series of
pre-emptive Israeli military strikes

trying to bring down Arafat, who has
been confined to the West Bank city
of Ramallah since early December.
