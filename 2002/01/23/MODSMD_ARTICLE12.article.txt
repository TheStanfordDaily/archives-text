## The 						Stanford Daily Admit weekend jobs provide valuable service

Some may say that students at Stanford
have little voice in the admissions pro
cess. Unlike other schools, there is no
student or alumni interview portion of
the application. In manvwavs, this policy may
be for the benefit of everyone. However, be
cause of it, one could say that the student body
is powerless to preserve any of its own c harac
ter. In other words, the propagation of our stu
dent culture relies on the discretion of a rela
tively small handful of administrators and ad
missions officers.
But while the student body doesn't get the
chance to admit or deny its own would-be
members, anyone associated with Stanford has
tin equally important role in the future of the

University by being able to pass on the word of
the Stanford experience.
Most students will tell you that they decid
ed to spend the time and money to apply here
because of the enthusiasm with which a stu
dent or alumnus described his Stanford
years. I he Admissions Office decides who
gets in, but they need the student body's help
in demonstrating why an acceptance letter is
an offer worth taking.
While every student fields his share of
Stanford questions from ambitious cousins
and shy underclassmen back at home,
Admit Weekend is the prime time for influ
encing the future freshman class en masse.
Volunteer Room Hosts, or "RoHos," take

prospective freshmen under their wing for
the weekend, showing them the ropes and
bringing them along to class. House hosts,
01 "HoHos," coordinate the dorm activities
that show what residential life at Stanford is
all about. Some current students came to
Stanford in spite of their hosts, but many
are here because of the amazing introduc
tion to Stanford they were given during
Admit Weekend.
The weekend of April 18-21 will lie our
chance to show this year's prospective fresh
men that Stanford has a place for them. By
taking them to class and sharing our curios
ity, they will realize that Stanford does in
deed deserve its first-class reputation. But

also, by being the friendly and energetic stu
dent body that we are, they will see that Stan
ford is also about community. Hopefully
every "Pro Fro" will see Stanford not only as
a top-rate academic institution, but also as an
exciting place where he or she will be able to
thrive as an individual.
In that sense, the chance to make sure that
Stanford remains everything it is lies in the
hands of all of us. Today is the deadline for
HoHo applications. If you don't have time to
take on the responsibilites of a HoHo, then
consider applying to be a Rol lo later this year.
Either way, you will be helping to ensure that
next year's class sees as much as possible of
what Stanford has to offer.
