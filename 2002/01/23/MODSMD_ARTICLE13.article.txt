## The 						Gaudet Doctrine 
### 
M<»! law students have no moral
compass. I hey study regularly
and score well on examina
tions. but the\ have not asked
the most basi< question: why? I here's no
purpose to their madness. ()ne instructor
asked his 20 students for their legal heroes.
()nl\ tw(> students had a i lear idea. I he rest
of them stammered, paused and stuttered.
()ne student fished around in his mind and
came up with "Clarence Harrow. He ar
gued for the right to tea< h evolution in the
famous "Scopes Monkey 1 rial.' 1 hat was

70 years ago. Suddenly,
about six people answered
"Clarence Da now ' in re
spouse to the instructoi s
question. They pulled his
name out of thin air. That
was the saddest da\ of m\
law school experience.
A recent Stanford Law
alumnus, Robert Bvrnes,

co-authored a book titled "Brush with the
Law" about his law school experience. I le is
a total bl<jwhard. \ ci, he cites common rea
sons for attending law s< liool: got in, need
ed a change, nothing better to do, live oil
loans, bought the mvth.
(10-author (aiine \farc|uart oilers the ir>l
- ription <>112 his* lassmates: "Dumb
people go to I larvard Law School. Not just
cheaters, crybabies or hypercompet.il ive a
—holes, all of whi< li are also in abundance
at Harvard Law School. I mean dumb.
Dense. Dinks By the time I had the sense to
understand thai, and the courage to accept
everything that weni along with it.ii was ba
sically too late lot me.
I disagree. Law students aren't dumb.
But they aie narrow-minded and overly-fo
cused on their own school work. Once I re
alized this. 1 was able to get the most out of
law school by applying the "Gaudet Doc
trine" to avoid three major pitfalls: getting
hurt, becoming confused and wasting time.
I he first pitfall is getting hurt. Let's face
it. It's no fun being nice lo si >meone who ig
nores you. Most students are so worried
about reading for the next da\ of c lass that
they don't take time to have a real conver
sation. Some of them don't have the social
skills. I hey've spent most of their lives wit 11
books. For them, people are a bothersome
distraction. When you nuclei stand that law
students have limited capacity and time
(five minutes maximum) for conversation,
then vou realize that there's no point in
starting one.
Consequently, you don'i give them an
opportunity to brush you off in a mad rush
to spend time with books.
The "Gaudet Doc trine" avoids a second
pitfall: becoming confused. Almost .ill law
students are confused. I hey don't have
le gal heroes. They don't have c leat reasons
to Ik- there or, like Byrnes, they may not
have anv good reason to lie there. I hey are
confused, misguided and directionless. II
you're not careful, you'll become that way
too. I Tie "Gaudet Doctrine" shields you
from people who act like weather vanes.
Otherwise, you'll end up drifting into the
same corporate jobs as cYervlxxlv else. A

latge percentage ol law students end up
working at large corporate' law firms.
There's one primary reason: these firms
come to law schools, interview students and
offer attractive salaries. Faking one of these
jobs is like pu king low-hanging fruit. Few
tare the work is boring. They just want the
money.
There's a nice fellow at the law school
who was offered an attractive summer
salary In New .York law firm Kaye St holer.
I nfbrtunately. he doesn't know about their
< looked background. 1 his firm helped Lin
coln Savings & I .oan deceive federal regula
tors in the 1980s. Lincoln Savings stuffed
their files with lake doc umcnts to make their
loans appear more solid than they were.
Kaye Sc holer lawyers knew all about it.
Nevertheless, the\ told federal regulators
that Lincoln Savings was a "well-hianaged,
prudent association." I .incoln Savings went
bankrupt and people lost $200 million in
deposited life savings. Normal people got
sc rewecl. As the American I xiwyer reported,
" That might never have happened without
kave Scholer's help." The federal govern
ment sued Kaye Sc holer and froze their as
sets. The firm settled In paying $41 million.
I his is how the Knron disaster hap
pened. Hie same firm which audited Lin
coln Savings & Loan and stitiled loan files
with lake documents — Arthur Andersen
is now under investigation for destroy
ing documents in the Knron matter. Docu
ment destruction is a fine art practiced at
main law firms and accounting houses.
One Stanford Law School professor coun
sels students in his ( apital Markets c lass to
have clients destrov documents rather than
save them. Your client c an't get into trouble
il there's no evidence. I his is ridiculous. but
it's the way lawyers (and ac countants) are
trained to earn a living. Most law students
fall right into this trap because they have no
c lear guidance, no moral visi< >n, nc> social re
sponsibility and no idea of the big picture.
A third reason to apply the "(iaudet Doc
trine" is to avoid wasting time. You can ini
tiate all kinds of small ttilk with law students
but, in the end. they are not likely to become
your friends. It saw aste ol time. I hey don't
have time for their own families. I hey don't
have time for old college friends. On the
whole, they certainly don't have time to
make new friends. I hey band together, like
jackals, in small groups for the purpose of
sharing notes, answering questions, ex
changing information and building their
sell-confidence. They won't help ton out of
the goodness of their hearts.
I here was one girl I thought was ex
it emelv nice. She smiled and talked. We
took a class in which I was registered fora
"pass / fail" grade and didn't do any of the
reading. I posed no threat to her CPA. At
the end of the term. I asked if I could bor
row her notes. She said, "no." I asked an
other girl and she said, "my notes are in re
ally bad shape." I told her that I didn't mind.
She said, "really, you wouldn't want to see
them." ()ne week later, she* borrowed some
one else's notes and returned them to the


Rob Gaudet
lender in front of my face. She didn't offer
them to me. 1 hat's typical. Law students
are in it for themselves.
Some of them are downright cor
rupt. Robert Byrnes brags on and on in
his book about an orgy in ihe Crothers
dormitory. Great. That's something to
write home about. Kven better, this guy
put ii into print so his whole family and
the rest of the world could read about
his shenanigans. His narrative has all
the glory of a flasher wearing a trench
coat on a rainy night. In addition, he
boasts about smoking dope every day
alter c lass and finishing each night with
some alcohol. This doesn't surprise me.
In my first year, there were at leasi six
people who smoked marijuana on a
regular basis. A bunch of them were al
< oholics to boot. ()ne guy told me about
his trip to a sex store in San Francisco
where he bumped into three female
classmates who were shopping around
for goodies to use upon themselves.
These are the people you meet in law
school. That's why you're better oil
avoiding them under the "Gaudet Doc
trine." Otherwise, they'll just waste
your time.
Law school could be different. Stu
dents could be screened in admissions
on the basis of their interests rather than
their Gl'As and LSAI scores. Once at
school, there should be a required

< ourse on civility.
The American Bar Association re
quires us to take a (ourse in ethk s. Why
not civility? It's just as important for the
production of good people, students
and professionals. Students at the Grad
uate School of Business have (ourses on
how to communicate, share feelings and
work on teams. Law students could use
some of this training.
In addition, faculty should instruct
their students on the importance ol
moral duty, civility, s<» ial responsibility
and accountability, fhe dean could
make this a central theme of her intro
duction to every incoming class. In my
first year, however, the former dean
had the following advice for our incom
ing class: "don't commingle your as
sets." (ireat. The depth of this wisdom
was exceeded only by the fact that it was
not original. 1 It* had been told the same
thing by Dean Griswold when he first
entered Harvard Law School.
I his is not what law s< hool should be
about. "Assets" belong to the business
school. Law school is a natural home for
discussions on right-versus-wrong, so
cial justice and the wavs we serve our
communities.
Our students (and sometimes our
faculty) seem to have forgotten the an
swer to a basic question: what is the ulti
mate goal of legal education?
Sometimes, I iliiuk they forgot the
question.

Rob (Hiiulet is a lltird-yea t law student who grate
fully acknowledges Christine and Sandeep for
asking and answering the difficult questions.
