On Dec. 12, 2000, the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors approved
Stanford's Ceneral Use Permit and Com
munity Plan, including approval of
5,000.000 s< |. It. of development. In turn,
Stanford agreed to all conditions set by
the (lounty.
One condition is the dedication of
two trails, connecting urban areas to
open spat e areas, in accordance with the
1995 Santa Clara Countywide Trails
Master Plan.
Stanford, environmentalists and many
community members disagree over place
ment of the trails. After intense public de
bate at their meeting on Dec. 4, the Board
of Supervisors voted 5-0 to postpone con
sideration of this issue until their Jan. 29
meeting.
I set up an online discussion on Neigh
borSpace.org, the Midpeninsula's com
munity website, so everyone could dia
logue about this issue. Some think that en
vironmentalists are ignoring Stanford's
past and present conservation efforts.

can develop further.

Brook's conclusions 'delusional'
I have some thoughts regarding last
Thursday's event sponsored by the Stan
ford ()bjectivist (Hub, the title of which was
"The Moral Case for Supporting Israel."
This was quite a show. Among the high
lights, Dr. Yaron Brook, from the Ayn
Rand Institute, proposed that Israel and
the Palestinians are not moral equals, that
"Israel created itself out of nothing." Dr.
Brook went further by saying that Israel's
founders had earned the right to their
land, that they bought —by legal means
— the land they currently occupy.
Moreover, Dr. Brook told his audi
ence that any country that enables any
one who lives within its borders to thrive,
regardless of his or her ethnicity or reli
gion, is a moral nation, and that Israel
undoubtedly qualifies.
Additionally, Dr. Brook said that Arabs
"bless Allah" for being born in Israel, be
cause in Israel, Arabs have thrived and are
fin better off. Dr. Brook also reiterated that
Israel is the victim, not Arabs, who, he said,
are stuck in a "Middle Ages" mentality.
Please. Who are these Arabs who "bless
Allah" for having Ix'en l>orn in Israel? I've
never met any. How are their lives better?
By hav ing to wait in humiliating checkpoints
while 18-year-olds with rifles stand and
mock them? By being evicted from their
homes and having to watch all their worldly
possessions bulldozed? By being second
class c iti/ens in what used to be their home?
I low one might realistically take in histor
ical fact and come to Dr. Brook's delusional
conclusions is completely beyond me. Ihe
fact is that, yes, some Palestinians are killing
inncx ent Israelis in Israel. But Israel is allo
cating government resources toward the
goal of assassinating anyone thought to be
involved in terrorist activities. There is no
trial; there is no jury. There is only the re
sponseofa brutal oppressor, the Israeli gov
ernment. I he fact is that Palestinians do not
have the same basic human lights as Israelis
in the state of Israel, that state that Dr. Brook
c alls the lone bastion of Western civility in a
sea of barbarism.

Here in America, crime rates are higher
among minorities than among white people.
Do we interpret this (as I)r. Brook does with
Palestinians) to mean that minorities are in
herently more violent people? C )f course not.
So why is it okay to come to that conclu
sion about Arabs?
Why should Stanford students care
about this ongoing debate? Because you
have people like Dr. Brook who gain sym
pathetic audiences, while explaning to a
large group of people here at Stanford that
Israel took land that did not belong to any
one, and that it did so legally. Dr. Brook,
believe it or not, actually told his audience
tonight that there was absolutely nothing
wrong with Israel claiming that small piece
of land as their own, just as there was noth
ing wrong with driving out Native Ameri
cans from their land years back. Just as
there is nothing wrong with the colonial
ism of much of Africa and South America,
something Dr. Brook claims left the in
digenous peoples of those areas in much
better shape than they were in originally.
Yes, you read that right. Dr. Brook told
his crowd that African nations "took the
worst of Western values and adopted that
instead of the best aspects of Western civi
li/ation." In essence, that it is the fault only
of developing nations for the poverty they
experience every day.
Dr. Brook should be ashamed of him
self, not only for holding arrogant and in
herently racist views, but also for being a
terrible historian, accepting those facts that
he aligns with his personal views (and
thereby making gross generalizations and
perpetuating stereotypes) but ignoring
those facts which do not lit into his rhetoric.
As though being a Stanford student isn't
hard enough, it's turning out (for me, any
way) to Ik- really tough as an Arab-Ameri
can in the post-9 /11 era, having to hear
people tell me that I, as an Arab, am back
wards and inherently violent. Such events
as those sponsored by the Stanford Objec
tivist club sure don't help much.

Brook's conclusions 'delusional'
I have some thoughts regarding last
Thursday's event sponsored by the Stan
ford ()bjectivist (Hub, the title of which was
"The Moral Case for Supporting Israel."
This was quite a show. Among the high
lights, Dr. Yaron Brook, from the Ayn
Rand Institute, proposed that Israel and
the Palestinians are not moral equals, that
"Israel created itself out of nothing." Dr.
Brook went further by saying that Israel's
founders had earned the right to their
land, that they bought —by legal means
— the land they currently occupy.
Moreover, Dr. Brook told his audi
ence that any country that enables any
one who lives within its borders to thrive,
regardless of his or her ethnicity or reli
gion, is a moral nation, and that Israel
undoubtedly qualifies.
Additionally, Dr. Brook said that Arabs
"bless Allah" for being born in Israel, be
cause in Israel, Arabs have thrived and are
fin better off. Dr. Brook also reiterated that
Israel is the victim, not Arabs, who, he said,
are stuck in a "Middle Ages" mentality.
Please. Who are these Arabs who "bless
Allah" for having Ix'en l>orn in Israel? I've
never met any. How are their lives better?
By hav ing to wait in humiliating checkpoints
while 18-year-olds with rifles stand and
mock them? By being evicted from their
homes and having to watch all their worldly
possessions bulldozed? By being second
class c iti/ens in what used to be their home?
I low one might realistically take in histor
ical fact and come to Dr. Brook's delusional
conclusions is completely beyond me. Ihe
fact is that, yes, some Palestinians are killing
inncx ent Israelis in Israel. But Israel is allo
cating government resources toward the
goal of assassinating anyone thought to be
involved in terrorist activities. There is no
trial; there is no jury. There is only the re
sponseofa brutal oppressor, the Israeli gov
ernment. I he fact is that Palestinians do not
have the same basic human lights as Israelis
in the state of Israel, that state that Dr. Brook
c alls the lone bastion of Western civility in a
sea of barbarism.

Here in America, crime rates are higher
among minorities than among white people.
Do we interpret this (as I)r. Brook does with
Palestinians) to mean that minorities are in
herently more violent people? C )f course not.
So why is it okay to come to that conclu
sion about Arabs?
Why should Stanford students care
about this ongoing debate? Because you
have people like Dr. Brook who gain sym
pathetic audiences, while explaning to a
large group of people here at Stanford that
Israel took land that did not belong to any
one, and that it did so legally. Dr. Brook,
believe it or not, actually told his audience
tonight that there was absolutely nothing
wrong with Israel claiming that small piece
of land as their own, just as there was noth
ing wrong with driving out Native Ameri
cans from their land years back. Just as
there is nothing wrong with the colonial
ism of much of Africa and South America,
something Dr. Brook claims left the in
digenous peoples of those areas in much
better shape than they were in originally.
Yes, you read that right. Dr. Brook told
his crowd that African nations "took the
worst of Western values and adopted that
instead of the best aspects of Western civi
li/ation." In essence, that it is the fault only
of developing nations for the poverty they
experience every day.
Dr. Brook should be ashamed of him
self, not only for holding arrogant and in
herently racist views, but also for being a
terrible historian, accepting those facts that
he aligns with his personal views (and
thereby making gross generalizations and
perpetuating stereotypes) but ignoring
those facts which do not lit into his rhetoric.
As though being a Stanford student isn't
hard enough, it's turning out (for me, any
way) to Ik- really tough as an Arab-Ameri
can in the post-9 /11 era, having to hear
people tell me that I, as an Arab, am back
wards and inherently violent. Such events
as those sponsored by the Stanford Objec
tivist club sure don't help much.
