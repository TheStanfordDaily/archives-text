## Higher education may prevent Alzheimer's BITS & BYTES 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
While a cure for Alzheimer's remains
elusive, science has made progress to
wards understanding the disease. Scien
tists now believe the disease is caused by an
inflammation of the brain due to plaque
formation, which ultimately causes memo
ry loss. Later this year, Johns Hopkins will
be releasing results on a 20-year study de
termining what link — if any — exists be
tween anti-inflammatory drugs (such as as
pirin) and Alzheimer's. Another set of dis
coveries stems from a six-year study of 078
nuns at Notre Dame who agreed to donate
their brains alter death. The study has
shown that pursuing higher education in

young adulthood or engaging in constant
mental activity significantly decreases the
chances of'developing Alzheimer's. So keep
working on those problem sets, or at least
the crossword puzzle!
Depression is the most common mental
illness among Americans, and the num
bers keep increasing. 1 lowever, according
to the Journal of the American Medical As
sociation, the number of patients being
treated has also increased. Between 1987
and 1997, the number increased from 1.8
million to million; those taking anti-de
pressants doubled. Prozac is by far the most
common medication. This good news lias a
downside, unlbrtunately. I lie* study found
that the percentage of people in therapy
has declined, which means more people
prefer to take pills than to talk out their
pre )blems.
Have you ever wondered how grapes
came to be seedless? Plants that result
from pollination failure, or nonfunctional
eggs or sperm, do not produce seeds but
still bear fruits — a phenomenon called
parthenocarpy. (irape-growers simply
propagate the plant by grafting, an asexu

al form of reproduction. The common ba
nana is an even more interesting case:
since it has three sets of genes, the seedless
version actually has only two sets, like hu
mans. Seedless watermelon c annot be cre
ated through grafting, but growers can
still induce fruit through parthenocarpy.

Cloning has been one of the hottest
scientific topics in the past few years.
Dolly, the lirst adult mammal to be
cloned, is now suffering from arthritis,
which is rare among sheep. Researc hers
believe that since Dolly's genes are older,

the c bailees of her contracting the disease
might be larger. Last year a team of scien
tists also c loned a gaur, an endangered
species. Although the resulting clone
died, it was the first instance of using
cloning to fight animal extinction, 112 inally,
last year the first human was cloned, al
though its development was stalled while
still in the embryo stage. While the ethical
implications are discussed, some say the
first human bab\ clone might be born be
fore the end of this year.

"What is tasty cannot be good for
you." That adage is sometimes right, but

not in the ( :ase <>l salmon. Algae are at tlie
base of the species' food chain. These
algae contain high levels ola special kind
of fat called omega-;!. Omega-3 fatty
acids seems to help the heart by prevent
ing platelets in the blood from clumping
together and sticking to arterial walls as
plaque. Omega-3 also combats bad cho
lesterol and probably alleviates inflam
mation caused by rheumatoid arthritis.
There is even evidence that omega-3
flitt\ acids surround brain cells and pro
ted them from aging diseases, such as
Alzheimer's. Long live salmon teriyaki.
Between the Earth and the stars there
is nothing but a void, right? Wrong. The
interstellar medium was long thought to
be a cold near-vacuum, but studies now
show it contains significant amounts of
hydrogen gas. Even more fascinating:
there are layers of hot and cold gas, actu
ally making an interstellar "atmosphere."
It is insignificant compared to a planetary
atmosphere, but stretches across thou
sands of light-years. Moreover, regions
rich in hot or cold hydrogen, termed
chimneys and fountains, respectively, are
thought to be crucial in star formation.
