### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Through a joint effort of BASES and
the Stanford Technology Ventures
Program, the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders Seminar presented
Ken Wirt of Palm, Inc. on Jan. 9. 1 le
discussed " The Knobcone Pine Theory
of Competitive Advantage." This theo
ry describes the proc ess of entering a
market sector after a catastrophic crash.
The speech focused on Palm's PDA in
troduction after the $20 million failure
of the Apple Newton. The Newton was
one of the first widely available PDAs.
After a crash iu a particular market
share, it is possible to have several years
to perfect a product before facing cor
porate competition.
"Palm had almost four years without
any competition," Win s;iid. "We began
in 1990 and no one Ix'lievcd the success
for six months. When the) couldn't ig
nore it any more, it ttxÂ»k one-and-a-h;dl
years for them to stait up; there was no
competition until March 2000."
Wirt presented a case study of Atari

and Nintendo, relating how Nintendo
used the Knobcone Pine strategy to
emerge after the "crash and burn" of
the video game industry.
Wirt is senior vice president of mar
keting for The Solutions Croup, the
hardware division of Palm, Inc. Based
in Santa Clara, Palm has about $1.5 bil-

lion in annual sales and employs 1,300
people worldwide.
"A significant number of Palm em

ployees are Stanford graduates," Wirt
said. Focusing on new technologies is
essential for corporate success.
"Products with ARM-based proces
sors and products fix used on wireless
communications are going to be two
major areas of innovation for us in
2002," Wirt said. "We think wireless is
in its infancy and will grow dramatic ally
each year, and five years from now
would be a good time to think of really
pervasive computing. With an original
idea, the advantage is being first, but
you're faced with the problem of get
ting it right."
In another effort to expand its prod
uct, Palm licenses its operating system
to third parties.
"Palm licensees would include Sam
sung, Handspring [and] Sony," Wirt
said. The company is prepared to com
pete with Microsoft's entrance into the
PDA market.
"Palm still has by far the dominant
market share, we have an 85 percent
share of the category," Wirt said. "Palm
continues to innovate and is the easiest
to use. We have a new focus in terms of

our marketing ellort on enterprise,
which is one ol Microsoft's strengths,
and that's how we're competing."
