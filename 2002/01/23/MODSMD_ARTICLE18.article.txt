# Professor skeptical of 'The Skeptical Environmentalist'
## 
### VICTOR REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A newbcx>kby Bjorn lomborg, a pro
fessor of statistics and political science at tiie
University of Aarhus in Denmark, claims
to debunk doomsday conceptions of the
environment. I lowcver, this month, Stan
ford environmental biology Prof. Stephen
Schneider and other leading scientist have
sharply criticized the work.
Shortly after its publication last year,
Lomborg's "The Skeptical Environ
mentalist: Measuring the Real State of
the World" attracted much attention
and praise.
"Why is a young, gay, liberal envi
ronmentalist suddenly the- darling of
the Fox News crowd?," asked a re
viewer for Rolling Stone, while The
Economist stated, " This is one of the
most valuable books on public policy
— not merely environmental policy
— to have been written for the intelli
gent general reader in the past ten
years." But the response from the sci
entific community has been far less
flattering.
In the January issues of Scientific
American and the online environmental
magazine (irist, Schneider and other ex
perts pic ked apart Lomborg's 500-page
volume. Schneider reviewed the Danish
statistician's chapter on global warming.
According to Lomborg, tempera
tures will only increase by 1.5 to 4.5 de
grees Celsius by the year 2100. In his
book, he disc ards the high estimate of
5.8 degrees Celsius put forth by the In
tergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) —the international
authority on the issue — and points
out that CNN, CBS and lime Maga
zine have all reported the IPCC's high
estimate without mentioning the low

estimate.
Schneider rejects how Lomborg
evaluates scientific results to argue
for the low estimate, and rejects the
charge of media bias.
"It's just as easy to find people
saying, 'Oh, look how well-off'we're
going to be,' " Schneider said. "But
the preponderance of news stories
has probably been more on the
doom end than the other, because
that's been the preponderance of
discoveries."
In his assessment of the carbon
dioxide emissions scenarios set forth

by the I PCX!, Lomborg concludes that
emissions "will decline towards the
end of the century, as we move to
wards ever cheaper renewable energy
sources." Further, lie discards the
more dire scenarios. He cites journal
articles and his own statistical analysis
to support this conclusion. Hut

Schneider calls this "the thinnest reed
of literature citation and superficial
analysis" in his review for Crist, and
says, "How dare this guy announce
the likelihood of various scenarios lo
which the SRES [the Il'CCs Special
Report on Emissions Scenarios] au
thors are very uneasy about assigning
probabilities?"
Lomborg also questions the effec
tiveness of the Kyoto Protocol. His
mathematical models indicate that the
agreement will only lead to 0.15 de
grees Celsius less warming and 2.5 cm
less of a rise in sea level by 2100.
However, Schneider points out in
his review for Scientific American that
Kyoto is only intended to be a starting
point. "Lomborg's creation of a 100-
year regime fora decade-long protocol
is a distortion of the climate policy
process," he says.
In the final section of the global
warming chapter, Lomborg argues
that the cost of reducing harmful
emissions outweighs the benefit of
avoiding climate change.
"With the best intentions of
doing something about global
warming, we could end up bur
dening the global community with
a cost much higher or even twice
that of global warming alone" he
said. But according to Schneider,
as Lomborg tallies costs and bene
fits, he neglects to consider cata
strophic outcomes, ecological im
pacts in general and recent find
ings by the U.S. Department of En
ergy that indicate that some emis
sions could be reduced at below
zero costs.
In the preface to "The Skeptical
Environmentalist," the author ex
plains how he first disbelieved and

then was inspired b\ the late 11 11 ian
Simon, an economics professor at
the University of Maryland and a
skeptic of environmcntalism.
" I he material conditions of life
will continue to get better for most
people, in most countries, most of
the time, indefinitely," wrote
Simon in 1097. "However, many
people will continue to think and
say that the conditions of life- are
getting worse."
Schneider sees another connec
tion between Simon and Lomborg.
"We've had a lot of claims made by
people who are not scientists, who
drop into a very complex subject
and neglect the complexities,"
Schneider said.
