a backup gen-

computer, phone, fax and light for eight to
10 hours before refueling. Fuel cells gener
ate electricity from the chemical interaction
between oxygen from the air and hydrogen
— and since the only byproduct is water, the

Popular toymaker Mattel has produced a life
size version of its original Hoi Wheels car, the
1969 Twin Mill. Boasting two roaring Chevy 502
big blocks, the real Twin Mill is reportedly a 1,400-
horsepower dream machine. Mattel does not plan
to take the I win Mill to the streets, reserving it to
show off at auto shows and races. Unfortunately,
the company lias no plans to market the unit.

l he Concorde is currently the only com
mercial airliner that can surpass the speed of
sound — at a price. Not only does a round trip
between New York and London cost $12,750,
but the plane's sonic boom can easily shatter
glass, restricting it to voyages across water.
Gulfstream, a company best known for making
planes that chauffeur celebrities and corporate
execs across the skies, is looking to change
that. The company's quiet supersonic jet, or
QS(, is set to hit the assembly lines by 2006.
rhe QS| will cruise between Mach 1.6 (1.6
times the speed of sound, or slightly less than
1,100 rnpli) and Mach 2 (1,320 mph). and will
be able to cover at least 4,600 miles before hav
ing to stop for refueling.
