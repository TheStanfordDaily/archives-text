low English-language proficiency and increasingly heated debate about the allocation of funding.

room help ior students; but educa
tion remains sub-standard in this
community, which has no local
high school.
In ihe* past tew months, dissent
within the school district has given
Hast Palo Alto residents new rea
sons to be suspicions of the dis
trict's commitment to its students,
and parents took to tlie streets to
protest the district's leadership last
()c tober.
Use of funding questioned
One reason for the district's
low test scores is that a large per
centage of students do not have a
high level of proficiency in the
English language; in the 1999-00
school year, just two-thirds of
fast Palo Alto students were con
sidered "English learners," ac
cording to the California Depart
ment of Education.
Since the standardized tests used
to assess academic performance
measure reading, language and
spelling — and in this year's state
figures, language arts performance
was weighted even more than in
previous years —Ravenswood stu
dents are at a disadvantage.
Some outsiders may blame the
district's performance on stan
dardized tests on inadequate
school funding, but both a district
teac her and administrator counter
that the school svstem is well-fund
ed. Fhe problem, according to
Cesar Chavez Elementary School
teachei Jesse Rosencranz-Engel
mann, is that the money is falling
info the wrong hands.
"We get federal funds and state
funds because we're under-per
forming." said Rosencranz-Engel
mann, who graduated from Stan
ford in 2000 and is currently teach
ing through the Teach for.Ameri
ca program.

"There is all this money out
there, but nobody knows where all
this money goes," he continued.
Sandra Sterling, principal of
(• reel 1 ()aks Elemental ). also said
she believes firmly that the dis
trict has both enough funding
and enough resources. "It's how
they are used" that matters. Ster
ling said.
Sterling said, however, that she
does not believe funds are being
misused.
She cited programs such as
the Open Court Reading Pro
gram. whit h requires students to
read for at least two hours a day,
and the computer-based Water
fort Program, which teaches stu
dents to read, as some of the dis
trici's richest opportunities for
students.
Instead, Sterling said that
main students come from fami
lies that have not exposed them
to certain mediums of learning,
which makes the job of the school
district very difficult.
"You can't expect a child to re
spond to something they know
nothing about," Sterling said.
Low pay causes high teacher
turnover
Rosenc ranz-Engehnann and
Sterling agree that students are
being positively influenced In mo
tivated teachers and quality pro
grams. I nfortunately, they say,
low pa\ and a disenchanting work
environment make ii difficult for
the district to retain young, edu
cated and energetic teac hers.
"Some of them are staying,
which is good, and some of them
are getting burned out because it's
jusi too overwhelming," Rosen
c ran/-Engelmann said.
Sterling said that if funding
were unlimited, slu- would use the
money to pav higher salaries to
teachers.
"You don't attract the best" to a
district with low teacher salaries,
Sterling said.

As a result, teachers in tlie
Ravenswood School District fre
quently leave before they have
gained experience. Although the
district's Beginning readier Assis
tance Program helps, by pairing
"experienced" teachers — those
with three or more years of experi
ence— with new ones, it does not
significantly help the district with
its primary problem of teacher re
tention.
Superintendent's credibility
questioned
Dr. (lharlie Mae Knight, supei -
intendent of the Ravenswood
School District, built an impressive
track record prior to recent
charges of corruption.
In 1997, she was commended
by then-Oov. Pete Wilson lor her
efforts to reduce c lass si/es in the
school district. In his State of the
State address, Wilson applauded
Knight for her efforts to lower c lass
sizes, adding that Knight had been
"doing a first-class job for Califor
nia's kids."
Wilson's praise stands in con
trast with Knight's current reputa
tion among some city residents.
Last year, she was charged with
I'.) counts of "conflict of interest"
related to an allegation ili.n she
was misusing an emergency school
district loan 112 und to lend money to
teachers who owed rent to her.
Although Knight was found in
nocent, some parents and district
staff members have expressed
skeptic ism about her intentions.
l liese charges did not mark the
first taint on Knight's reputation,
file superintendent's acquittal
came on the heels of a San |osc
Mercury News report that under
her watch, the school distric I spent
$600,000 on travel between 1998
and 2000.
In 2000 alone, Knight took l:i
district-paid trips — some to le
gitimate educational conferences
and others to events such as the
Miami funeral of actress Lsthcr

Rolle, star of television sitcom
"(iood limes."
In reaction to allegations of cor
ruption within the district, about
10 parents, children and support
el s staged a protest in ()dober, de
manding that Knight and board
members step down from office.
"We parents in this district want
to tell the world, enough is
enough," said Marcelino Lopez,
one of the protesters, the Palo Alto
Weekly reported.
"We can't gamble with the edu
cation of our kids," Lope/ added.
"We want to make sure they will be
prepared to go to high school."
But Creen Oaks Principal Ster
ling said she believes Knight is
doing her job well — "as well as
she can," she saicl.
Last Palo Alto resident \akema
Cranger, 16, said to the San Jose
Mercury News of the charges filed
against Knight, "I thought it was a
lie. The media always lies. | Knight |
likes kids."
Knight did not return The
I )aily's calls.
Racial tensions affect schools
Administrators in the
Ravenswood School District are
predominantly African-American,
while teachers are mostlv white.
I lie majority of students and com
munity members are I lispanic, ac
cording to the California Depart
ment of Lducation.
"Overall, there's a lot of racial
dynamic s," Rosenc ran/-Lngel
niann said." I "here's a real struggle
between the historicallv-blac k LPA
community and the growing Mis
panic population. I hat s the heart
ol the issue.
Sterling, who has been in the
school district for HO years, ac
knowledged that the demograph
ics within the school system have
( hanged, but said she believes this
lias not caused conflict.
Sterling also notes that the rela
tionship between teac hers and ad
ministrators is "one of openness

and supportiveness."
" I he administrators have made
a commitment to work together so
that there's consistency across the
district," she said. "We're not com
peting — we're here to educate all
our children."
Uwi Rosencranz-Engelmann
claims that (he bond between ad
ministrators may have a darker
side. A major conflict within the
school system, he says, is the rift
between administrators — who
Rosencranz-Engelmann called
Knight's "followers" — and
teachers.
"Many of the white staff mem
bers are young, highly-educated
teachers," Rosencranz-Engel
mann said. "They're lree-think
ing, independent people who have
different values than this 'fbllow
t lie-leader' attitude."
Judge criticizes district's special
education program
Criticism of the Ravenswood
School District runs deeper than
allegations of Knight's corruption
and administrators' blind support
of its superintendent. This fall,
I S. District Court Judge I helton
Henderson chastised the district
for failing to meet the needs of its
special education students, who
niake up about 10 percent of its
student body.
Despite ;i 1996 lawsuit filed by
parents of special education stu
dents. the district still had not re
formed its special education pro
gram. I he same parents returned
to court, asking that the district be
held in contempt.
I lenderson delivered to the dis
tric i this final ultimatum: provide a
"free and appropriate education"
for students with disabilities, or
i isk being taken over by the state.
I he district lias until March to
do this, but progress has been ten
uous thus far.
In December, a court-appoint
ed monitor completed a report
finding that the district had failed

to hire staff qualified to teach stu
dents with mental and physical dis
abilities, and that of the court's !il
demands, the district had only
complied with five.
Currently, some special edu
cation students in the district
spend one part of their day in
special education classrooms
and another part in general ed
ucation classrooms. According
to Rosencranz-Engelmann, one
of the district's proposed plans
for dealing with the needs of
such students is to eliminate
separate special education c lass
rooms altogether and place
those students in "mainstream"
classrooms for the entire day.
"That would supposedly give a
better education to special educa
tion students, but this is faulty rea
soning because they're not giving
teac hers the resources to meet the
needs of all these students," Rosen
cranz-Engelmann said.
"Some of these students are on
a second-grade level and you're
teaching eighth graders, so it's
pretty hard to meet the needs of all
these kids," he added.
"They would need to have
teacher's aides, which they don't
have, and they need to give the
teachers a lot more resources,
which they don't do."
Sterling, on the other hand,
said she feels the district "has made
an honest eflbrt to really address
special education" through parent
forums and meetings, and in-ser
vice programs feir teachers.
'A lose-lose situation'
Whether or not operation of
Ravenswood School District ends
up being handed over to state con
trol, though, the outlook for the
district is murky.
" 1 he state can't do a much bet
ter job [than we're doing], but
without additional resources, we
can't do a nine h better job either,"
Rosencranz-Engelmann admitted.
"It's kind of a lose-lose situation."

Judge criticizes district's special
education program
Criticism of the Ravenswood
School District runs deeper than
allegations of Knight's corruption
and administrators' blind support
of its superintendent. This fall,
I S. District Court Judge I helton
Henderson chastised the district
for failing to meet the needs of its
special education students, who
niake up about 10 percent of its
student body.
Despite ;i 1996 lawsuit filed by
parents of special education stu

to court, asking that the district be
held in contempt.

"free and appropriate education"
for students with disabilities, or

I he district lias until March to
do this, but progress has been ten

In December, a court-appoint

finding that the district had failed

to hire staff qualified to teach stu

abilities, and that of the court's !il
demands, the district had only
complied with five.
Currently, some special edu
cation students in the district
spend one part of their day in
special education classrooms
and another part in general ed
ucation classrooms. According
to Rosencranz-Engelmann, one
of the district's proposed plans
for dealing with the needs of
such students is to eliminate
separate special education c lass
rooms altogether and place
those students in "mainstream"
classrooms for the entire day.
"That would supposedly give a
better education to special educa

cranz-Engelmann said.
"Some of these students are on
a second-grade level and you're

pretty hard to meet the needs of all
these kids," he added.
"They would need to have
teacher's aides, which they don't
have, and they need to give the
teachers a lot more resources,
which they don't do."
Sterling, on the other hand,
said she feels the district "has made

special education" through parent
forums and meetings, and in-ser

'A lose-lose situation'

In issuing decidedly mixed test score results last

tion remains sub-standard in this
community, which has no local
high school.
In ihe* past tew months, dissent
within the school district has given
Hast Palo Alto residents new rea
sons to be suspicions of the dis
trict's commitment to its students,
and parents took to tlie streets to
protest the district's leadership last
()c tober.
Use of funding questioned
One reason for the district's
low test scores is that a large per
centage of students do not have a
high level of proficiency in the
English language; in the 1999-00
school year, just two-thirds of
fast Palo Alto students were con
sidered "English learners," ac
cording to the California Depart
ment of Education.
Since the standardized tests used
to assess academic performance
measure reading, language and
spelling — and in this year's state
figures, language arts performance
was weighted even more than in
previous years —Ravenswood stu
dents are at a disadvantage.
Some outsiders may blame the
district's performance on stan
dardized tests on inadequate
school funding, but both a district
teac her and administrator counter
that the school svstem is well-fund
ed. Fhe problem, according to
Cesar Chavez Elementary School
teachei Jesse Rosencranz-Engel
mann, is that the money is falling
info the wrong hands.
"We get federal funds and state
funds because we're under-per
forming." said Rosencranz-Engel
mann, who graduated from Stan
ford in 2000 and is currently teach
ing through the Teach for.Ameri
ca program.

"There is all this money out
there, but nobody knows where all
this money goes," he continued.
Sandra Sterling, principal of
(• reel 1 ()aks Elemental ). also said
she believes firmly that the dis
trict has both enough funding
and enough resources. "It's how
they are used" that matters. Ster
ling said.
Sterling said, however, that she
does not believe funds are being
misused.
She cited programs such as
the Open Court Reading Pro
gram. whit h requires students to
read for at least two hours a day,
and the computer-based Water
fort Program, which teaches stu
dents to read, as some of the dis
trici's richest opportunities for
students.
Instead, Sterling said that
main students come from fami
lies that have not exposed them
to certain mediums of learning,
which makes the job of the school
district very difficult.
"You can't expect a child to re
spond to something they know
nothing about," Sterling said.
Low pay causes high teacher
turnover
Rosenc ranz-Engehnann and
Sterling agree that students are
being positively influenced In mo
tivated teachers and quality pro
grams. I nfortunately, they say,
low pa\ and a disenchanting work
environment make ii difficult for
the district to retain young, edu
cated and energetic teac hers.
"Some of them are staying,
which is good, and some of them
are getting burned out because it's
jusi too overwhelming," Rosen
c ran/-Engelmann said.
Sterling said that if funding
were unlimited, slu- would use the
money to pav higher salaries to
teachers.
"You don't attract the best" to a
district with low teacher salaries,
Sterling said.

As a result, teachers in tlie
Ravenswood School District fre
quently leave before they have
gained experience. Although the
district's Beginning readier Assis
tance Program helps, by pairing
"experienced" teachers — those
with three or more years of experi
ence— with new ones, it does not
significantly help the district with
its primary problem of teacher re
tention.
Superintendent's credibility
questioned
Dr. (lharlie Mae Knight, supei -
intendent of the Ravenswood
School District, built an impressive
track record prior to recent
charges of corruption.
In 1997, she was commended
by then-Oov. Pete Wilson lor her
efforts to reduce c lass si/es in the
school district. In his State of the
State address, Wilson applauded
Knight for her efforts to lower c lass
sizes, adding that Knight had been
"doing a first-class job for Califor
nia's kids."
Wilson's praise stands in con
trast with Knight's current reputa
tion among some city residents.
Last year, she was charged with
I'.) counts of "conflict of interest"
related to an allegation ili.n she
was misusing an emergency school
district loan 112 und to lend money to
teachers who owed rent to her.
Although Knight was found in
nocent, some parents and district
staff members have expressed
skeptic ism about her intentions.
l liese charges did not mark the
first taint on Knight's reputation,
file superintendent's acquittal
came on the heels of a San |osc
Mercury News report that under
her watch, the school distric I spent
$600,000 on travel between 1998
and 2000.
In 2000 alone, Knight took l:i
district-paid trips — some to le
gitimate educational conferences
and others to events such as the
Miami funeral of actress Lsthcr

Rolle, star of television sitcom
"(iood limes."
In reaction to allegations of cor
ruption within the district, about
10 parents, children and support
el s staged a protest in ()dober, de
manding that Knight and board
members step down from office.
"We parents in this district want
to tell the world, enough is
enough," said Marcelino Lopez,
one of the protesters, the Palo Alto
Weekly reported.
"We can't gamble with the edu
cation of our kids," Lope/ added.
"We want to make sure they will be
prepared to go to high school."
But Creen Oaks Principal Ster
ling said she believes Knight is
doing her job well — "as well as
she can," she saicl.

Sandra Sterling, principal of

she believes firmly that the dis

Sterling said, however, that she
does not believe funds are being

Low pay causes high teacher

low pa\ and a disenchanting work

Sterling said that if funding
were unlimited, slu- would use the
money to pav higher salaries to
teachers.
"You don't attract the best" to a
district with low teacher salaries,
Sterling said.

As a result, teachers in tlie
Ravenswood School District fre
quently leave before they have
gained experience. Although the
district's Beginning readier Assis

"experienced" teachers — those
with three or more years of experi

significantly help the district with
its primary problem of teacher re

Superintendent's credibility

Dr. (lharlie Mae Knight, supei -

track record prior to recent

school district. In his State of the
State address, Wilson applauded
Knight for her efforts to lower c lass
sizes, adding that Knight had been
"doing a first-class job for Califor
nia's kids."
Wilson's praise stands in con
trast with Knight's current reputa

Last year, she was charged with
I'.) counts of "conflict of interest"
related to an allegation ili.n she
was misusing an emergency school
district loan 112 und to lend money to
teachers who owed rent to her.
Although Knight was found in
nocent, some parents and district
staff members have expressed
skeptic ism about her intentions.
l liese charges did not mark the
first taint on Knight's reputation,
file superintendent's acquittal
came on the heels of a San |osc
Mercury News report that under
her watch, the school distric I spent
$600,000 on travel between 1998

In 2000 alone, Knight took l:i
district-paid trips — some to le
gitimate educational conferences
and others to events such as the
Miami funeral of actress Lsthcr

In reaction to allegations of cor

"We parents in this district want

"We can't gamble with the edu

Judge criticizes district's special
education program
Criticism of the Ravenswood
School District runs deeper than
allegations of Knight's corruption
and administrators' blind support
of its superintendent. This fall,
I S. District Court Judge I helton
Henderson chastised the district
for failing to meet the needs of its
special education students, who
niake up about 10 percent of its
student body.
Despite ;i 1996 lawsuit filed by
parents of special education stu
dents. the district still had not re
formed its special education pro
gram. I he same parents returned
to court, asking that the district be
held in contempt.
I lenderson delivered to the dis
tric i this final ultimatum: provide a
"free and appropriate education"
for students with disabilities, or
i isk being taken over by the state.
I he district lias until March to
do this, but progress has been ten
uous thus far.
In December, a court-appoint
ed monitor completed a report
finding that the district had failed

to hire staff qualified to teach stu
dents with mental and physical dis
abilities, and that of the court's !il
demands, the district had only
complied with five.
Currently, some special edu
cation students in the district
spend one part of their day in
special education classrooms
and another part in general ed
ucation classrooms. According
to Rosencranz-Engelmann, one
of the district's proposed plans
for dealing with the needs of
such students is to eliminate
separate special education c lass
rooms altogether and place
those students in "mainstream"
classrooms for the entire day.
"That would supposedly give a
better education to special educa
tion students, but this is faulty rea
soning because they're not giving
teac hers the resources to meet the
needs of all these students," Rosen
cranz-Engelmann said.
"Some of these students are on
a second-grade level and you're
teaching eighth graders, so it's
pretty hard to meet the needs of all
these kids," he added.
"They would need to have
teacher's aides, which they don't
have, and they need to give the
teachers a lot more resources,
which they don't do."
Sterling, on the other hand,
said she feels the district "has made
an honest eflbrt to really address
special education" through parent
forums and meetings, and in-ser
vice programs feir teachers.
'A lose-lose situation'
Whether or not operation of
Ravenswood School District ends
up being handed over to state con
trol, though, the outlook for the
district is murky.
" 1 he state can't do a much bet
ter job [than we're doing], but
without additional resources, we
can't do a nine h better job either,"
Rosencranz-Engelmann admitted.
"It's kind of a lose-lose situation."
In issuing decidedly mixed test score results last
week, California's Department of Education dealt
another blow to East Palo Alto's maligned
Ravenswood School District — a district already
under lire lor court charges against its superinten
dent, its inadequate special education provisions
and the suspension of a principal.
The state's 2001 Base Academic Performance
Index revealed that, compared to other schools

with similar re
sources, hall ol the
Raven s wo o d
schools scored in
the top 10 percent

of their group; but compared to all California
schools, live out of the eight East Palo Alto institu

I hough culled simply from multiple choice test
scores, the index tells a broader story about East
Palo Alto's schools. Young, enthusiastic, well-edu

room help ior students; but educa
tion remains sub-standard in this
community, which has no local
high school.
In ihe* past tew months, dissent
within the school district has given
Hast Palo Alto residents new rea
sons to be suspicions of the dis
trict's commitment to its students,
and parents took to tlie streets to
protest the district's leadership last
()c tober.
Use of funding questioned
One reason for the district's
low test scores is that a large per
centage of students do not have a
high level of proficiency in the
English language; in the 1999-00
school year, just two-thirds of
fast Palo Alto students were con
sidered "English learners," ac
cording to the California Depart
ment of Education.
Since the standardized tests used
to assess academic performance
measure reading, language and
spelling — and in this year's state
figures, language arts performance
was weighted even more than in
previous years —Ravenswood stu
dents are at a disadvantage.
Some outsiders may blame the
district's performance on stan
dardized tests on inadequate
school funding, but both a district
teac her and administrator counter
that the school svstem is well-fund
ed. Fhe problem, according to
Cesar Chavez Elementary School
teachei Jesse Rosencranz-Engel
mann, is that the money is falling
info the wrong hands.
"We get federal funds and state
funds because we're under-per
forming." said Rosencranz-Engel
mann, who graduated from Stan
ford in 2000 and is currently teach
ing through the Teach for.Ameri

abilities, and that of the court's !il
demands, the district had only
complied with five.
Currently, some special edu
cation students in the district
spend one part of their day in
special education classrooms
and another part in general ed
ucation classrooms. According
to Rosencranz-Engelmann, one
of the district's proposed plans
for dealing with the needs of
such students is to eliminate
separate special education c lass
rooms altogether and place
those students in "mainstream"
classrooms for the entire day.
"That would supposedly give a
better education to special educa
tion students, but this is faulty rea
soning because they're not giving
teac hers the resources to meet the
needs of all these students," Rosen
cranz-Engelmann said.
"Some of these students are on
a second-grade level and you're
teaching eighth graders, so it's
pretty hard to meet the needs of all
these kids," he added.
"They would need to have
teacher's aides, which they don't
have, and they need to give the
teachers a lot more resources,
which they don't do."
Sterling, on the other hand,
said she feels the district "has made
an honest eflbrt to really address
special education" through parent
forums and meetings, and in-ser
vice programs feir teachers.
'A lose-lose situation'
Whether or not operation of
Ravenswood School District ends
up being handed over to state con
trol, though, the outlook for the
district is murky.
" 1 he state can't do a much bet
ter job [than we're doing], but
without additional resources, we
can't do a nine h better job either,"
Rosencranz-Engelmann admitted.
"It's kind of a lose-lose situation."
