# FTC calls for telemarketing restrictions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — People who want
to stop most telemarketers from calling their
homes will I»t* able to do so with a single request
if the government lias its way.
l he Federal I racle Commission said yester
day it wants to create a national "do not call"
registry, strengthening existing telemarketing
rules that forbid late-night calls and deceptive
sales tactics.
The proposed changes would also prevent
telemarketers from hiding their identities from
consumer's caller II) boxes and keep them
from sharing billing information about their
customers.
"We're not saying 'don't call." It's consumers
saving 'don't call, said Howard Beales, the
1-TC's director of consumer protection. "They
would prefer not to get calls entirely or at incon
venient times."
For Peg keeley, H4, sales c alls got so bad she
had her call waiting disconnected so telemar
keters would stop interrupting her on the

phone. The retired government worker from
Springfield, 111., said she gets as many as four
calls a day, hot hering her during meals or when
she has company.
Current rules require specific telemarketers
to obey when consumers ask to be put on a "do
not call" list. Under the new proposal, Beales
said, one toll-free call to the FTC would stop
most telemarketing calls made from outside a
consumer's state. Consumers could choose to
allow calls 112 rom certain companies or charities.
Telemarketers would have to update their
no-call lists monthly from the national list,
which would cost the agency between $4 mil
lion and $6 million in the first year.
1 lie FFC plans public hearings in June on
the registry and other proposed telemarketing
regulations. Agency commissioners could vote
on the changes as soon as a year from now.
Beales said the list would make it easier for
investigators to follow up on consumer com
plaints of telemarketers who call an) way. Viola

tors could be lined up to $ 11,000 lor each c all.
Telemarketers say a national registry isnt
needed.
H. Robert Wieni/en, president ol the Direct
Marketing Association, said people who do not
want to be called can request that their names be
added his group's list, which has 4.1 million
names. I le said many telemarketers, including
those calling from within suites, participate in the
service and abide by the list.
" The government may be overstepping its
boundaries by spending taxpayer dollars to
limit communication," Wient/en said. I le said
the proposed rules would hurt the industry,
driving companies out of the country to avoid
the regulations.
Beales said the national registry would
apply to companies that aren't part ol the as
sociation.
More than 25 states already have legislation
requiring "do not call" lists, according to the
National Conference of State Legislatures.
