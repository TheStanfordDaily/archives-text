with authority.
With the team down 6-0, red
shirt freshman Matt Gentry
pinned the Roadrunners' Elizar
Ceballos, ranked second in the
Pac-10 at 149 pounds, to even the
team score at six apiece.
"When a pin happens, it invig

orates the crowd, it invigorates
the team, and it makes the next
guy who steps out onto the mat
want to do the same thing," head
coach Steve Buddie said.
Senior Levi Weikel-Magden
did just that, following Gentry
with a pin at 157 pounds to give
the Cardinal a 12-6 lead it would

John Garfinkel earned his first
dual meet win of the year in a 0-
2 decision over Bakersfield's
Bryan Busby.

true freshman Imad Kharbush
earned a decision and junior
Harold Penson won by forfeit. Ju

O'Near in t he 285-pound division
to clinch the win for Stanford.
"The most impressive thing in
the whole dual meet was getting
the three pins," Buddie said.
"Starting with two losses is never
easy, but instead of our wrestlers
deciding to come back and eke
out a few victories, they decided
to open the flood gates."
On Sunday, Stanford traveled
