Friday: Stanford 30, Cal

Sunday: Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo 25, Stanford 18

Stanford (5-5, 1-2 Pacific 10
Conference) out-muscled confer
ence foe Bakersfield, 30-13, in a
dominating performance on Fri
day before falling 25-18 to Cal
Poly on Sunday.
Wrestling in front of a home
crowd for the first time since Nov.
10, Stanford fell behind early
against Bakersfield by dropping
the first two bouts for the third
straight meet. This time, howev
er, the Cardinal bounced back
with authority.
With the team down 6-0, red
shirt freshman Matt Gentry
pinned the Roadrunners' Elizar
Ceballos, ranked second in the
Pac-10 at 149 pounds, to even the
team score at six apiece.
"When a pin happens, it invig

orates the crowd, it invigorates
the team, and it makes the next
guy who steps out onto the mat
want to do the same thing," head
coach Steve Buddie said.
Senior Levi Weikel-Magden
did just that, following Gentry
with a pin at 157 pounds to give
the Cardinal a 12-6 lead it would
not relinquish.
Stanford saw its lead increase
in the next bout, as sophomore
John Garfinkel earned his first
dual meet win of the year in a 0-
2 decision over Bakersfield's
Bryan Busby.
rhe onslaught continued as
true freshman Imad Kharbush
earned a decision and junior
Harold Penson won by forfeit. Ju
nior Brad Selby pinned Scott
O'Near in t he 285-pound division
to clinch the win for Stanford.
"The most impressive thing in
the whole dual meet was getting
the three pins," Buddie said.
"Starting with two losses is never
easy, but instead of our wrestlers
deciding to come back and eke
out a few victories, they decided
to open the flood gates."
On Sunday, Stanford traveled
to San Luis Obispo to square ofl
against Cal Poly in another Pac
-10 matchup.
The Cardinal responded to an
opening bout defeat by notching
three consecutive wins, including
