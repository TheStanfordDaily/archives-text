# Gill leads hungry Card gymnasts
## All-American Daniel Gill is anxious for men to rejoin elite squads 
### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Daniel Gill, a blue-eyed sinewy
5-foot-8 sophomore, takes a short
breather before practice starts on a
cloudless Friday afternoon.
Glad from head to toe in dark
grey sweats, he holds a Dannon
Strawberry yogurt in one hand, a
spoon in the other, as he jokes
around with his fellow teammates.
The light conversation gives the
impression that Gill is just another
of America's college gymnasts,
facing the common travails of bal
ancing school and athletics. Make
no doubt about it though, Dan is
hungry.
Next door, in the 81-year-old
Malin Burnham Pavilion, three
Gardinal banners hang from the
rafters, grandly proclaiming what
mighty Stanford has accomplished
in men's gymnastics: three nation
al championships in tin 1 last
decade. And after the last one, in
1995, no more.
A 210 calorie yogurt can do little
to appease Gill's hunger, which in
cludes a six-year drought, as well as
last year's 2-8 record.
"Last year was a tough year, but
we're ready for this year. We have
a national championship in our
sights," he said.
For Gill, last year's freshman
phenom-turned-All-American, ar
riving this afternoon at the Ford
Center's gymnastics practice facili
ty was a journey that took 13 years,

beginning at the age of seven in
Richmond, Virginia. The Ontario
born native began gymnastics "as
just another activity," in between
baseball, soccer and diving. And
that's where the problems began.
"1 found out that I had a knack
for it. I learned fairly quickly, and
my competitive nature helped," he
explained.
Gill soon gave up his other ac
tivities as his gymnastics career
took off, culminating with a spot on
the Junior National team. Dedicat
ing 15 hours a week. Gill learned
how to become a team player in an
individual sport.
"Being part of my [club] team
was really healthy at my age, for 1
was young and impressionable,"
he said. "One of the greatest
lessons I learned was to lead
through example and hope that
everyone would follow."
By high school, Gill had
changed gyms, moving to the
Capital Gymnastics National
Training Center, where lie
promptly began to pack his gym
bag with accolades. His senior ye;ir
he set the all-time national high
school record in the Ail-Around at
the 2000 High School National
Championships, adding this feat
to his three-time All-Met Gymnast
of the Year honors.
With this impressive resume,
(all had his pit kof the litter among
colleges, including this year's No. 2
ranked Penn State. Ultimately
though, Gill — who wants to be an
Orthopedic Surgeon — chose the
strong academics at Stanford, as
well as the technical brilliance oi
30-year veteran head coach Sadao
