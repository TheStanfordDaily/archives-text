# Divers splash short at Bruin Invite
## Despite setting several career bests, Stanford is unable to get past USC's dominant divers 
### VESSELA STOYANOVA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women divers made a splash at
the Bruin Diving Invitational last Friday and Sat
urday to come out with strong team finishes in all
three events contested. The Cardinal placed five
divers in the top 10 of the 3-meter and the 1-
meter springboard events, and four divers in the
top seven of the platform competition.
As part of the Stanford women's swimming
program, the divers are currently at the top of the
national rankings. However, last weekend they
came short of fulfilling their goal of upsetting
their strongest rival, Southern California, who is
considered the top diving squad in the West.
"We're a really good team, but we need to
step up," said head diving coach Rick

Schavone.
Stanford's highest finish of the weekend was
posted by AU-Ainerican junior McKenze Mur
phy. who took third place in the 1-meter event
with a score of 507.75. She also finished fourth
in the 3-meter, with 509.15 points, a season
best for her.
Teammate Kim Powers, an All-American se
nior, came fourth in the platform competition,
after scoring 117.7 points.
Among the other Stanford divers who
placed in the top ten of the three events were se
nior Alexis Sowa and freshmen Ashlee Rosen
thal and Lauren Donovan. All three posted ca
reer-best marks in the 3-meter competition.
"We showed our endurance and ability to
keep performing while fatigued," Murphy said.
"We still need to keep working and training hard
so that we can put up a better fight at Pac-10's
The Cardinal was edged b\ USC, whose
freshman Blvthe Hartley, sophomore Nicci
Fusaro and senior Kellie Brennan finished
among the top five.
So far this season, Hartley and Fusaro have

had an impressive streak of first- and second
place performances. In a strong showing at the
Bruin Invitational, Hartley captured (lie title in
the 3-meter event (573.(55).
Rachelle kunkel, an exhibition swimmer,
won the 1-meter competition (614.25), fol
lowed by Brennan in second place. In the
platform event, Wang Rui ofTsingua Univer
sity claimed the crown with 498.6 points,
while Fusaro and Hartley came second and
third, respectively.
Schavone was not surprised by last week
end's results:
"USC is ;i great team," he said. "They were
there for us to compete with, and I was not real
pleased with the outcome. Our results were
good, but we were still too far behind I S(We
need to lessen that gap."
Stanford will next be in action when the
Cardinal women's swimming and diving team
hosts Arizona at 1 p.m on Frida\ and Arizona
State 12 p.m. on Saturda\ in its first two I'ac
-10 dual meets of the season at the Avery
Aquatic Center.
