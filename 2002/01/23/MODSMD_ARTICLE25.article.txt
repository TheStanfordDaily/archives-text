# Biting sarcasm fooled a few and left bad taste

### 
I was initially pretty excited after
receiving so much feedback
from my last column, Thurs
day's "The Sixth Man Syn
drome: Stupidity" [1 ruth.]
It made me proud to know that I have

so many committed read
ers out there who race to
the corner of the Quad
every morning to pic k up
a fresh copy of the Daily
and ingest my pithy mus
ings.[Sarcasm.]
But then a friend's
story made me realize
how most people proba-

bly read it.
During the middle of another en
lightening Psych 1 lecture [Sarcasm],
she was trying to complete the impossi
ble Thursday crossword puzzle when
she saw my goofy face grinning off an
adjacent page and figured my poor writ
ing might provide her a few moments of
humor [Sadly, truth.]
But, apparently, a lot of people didn't
find it funny. 1 guess I unintentionally
provided some people a few moments of
anger instead.

Not since poor 1 Ingli Grant was arrest
ed for kindly giving a late-night ride to Di
vine Brown has a man been this misun
derstood [Not really sarcasm, just a bad,
bad joke.]
So, let me clear things up. For the
kind soul [sarcasm] who called the col
umn the worst piece of sports writing
lie's ever read, the wide receiver /
power forward who wants to put a list
through my head [truth] and everyone
else who thought I was serious, the en
tire column was sarcastic. [Yeah, I'll
stop now.]
I naively thought that the headline and
the italicized closing line, in which I pre
dicted a trip to the Sweet Sixteen and ex
horted spoiled readers to get behind the
team, would be enough to indicate my
true feelings.
I thought that including jokes about
online Doom would tip off the rest. (I
mean, who thought I was serious about
wasting days of my life massacring
strangers over the telephone lines? Sitting
in front of the Play Station simulating 10
straight seasons of NBA Live is far cooler
