# Biting sarcasm fooled a few and left bad taste

### 
I was initially pretty excited after
receiving so much feedback
from my last column, Thurs
day's "The Sixth Man Syn
drome: Stupidity" [1 ruth.]
It made me proud to know that I have

so many committed read
ers out there who race to
the corner of the Quad
every morning to pic k up
a fresh copy of the Daily
and ingest my pithy mus
ings.[Sarcasm.]
But then a friend's
story made me realize
how most people proba-

bly read it.
During the middle of another en
lightening Psych 1 lecture [Sarcasm],
she was trying to complete the impossi
ble Thursday crossword puzzle when
she saw my goofy face grinning off an
adjacent page and figured my poor writ
ing might provide her a few moments of
humor [Sadly, truth.]
But, apparently, a lot of people didn't
find it funny. 1 guess I unintentionally
provided some people a few moments of
anger instead.

Not since poor 1 Ingli Grant was arrest
ed for kindly giving a late-night ride to Di
vine Brown has a man been this misun
derstood [Not really sarcasm, just a bad,
bad joke.]
So, let me clear things up. For the
kind soul [sarcasm] who called the col
umn the worst piece of sports writing
lie's ever read, the wide receiver /
power forward who wants to put a list
through my head [truth] and everyone
else who thought I was serious, the en
tire column was sarcastic. [Yeah, I'll
stop now.]
I naively thought that the headline and
the italicized closing line, in which I pre
dicted a trip to the Sweet Sixteen and ex
horted spoiled readers to get behind the
team, would be enough to indicate my
true feelings.
I thought that including jokes about
online Doom would tip off the rest. (I
mean, who thought I was serious about
wasting days of my life massacring
strangers over the telephone lines? Sitting
in front of the Play Station simulating 10
straight seasons of NBA Live is far cooler


Jonathan Stull
and much less violent.)
Basically, I thought that, if
read completely, the article just
dripped of sarc asm.
Obviously, it didn't. When it
came down to it. I didn't do a
good enough job getting my
point across.
Maybe I should've been more
obvious. I could've included
some helpful bracketed sarcasm
indicators like I have above.
Whatever 1 did, it wasn't
enough. Wa\ too many people
wrote me, came up to me or ac -
costed friends to tell them that I
was the worst, most spoiled, front
running, band wagon-jumping

fan alive.
That ma\ still be true. But I
really think this team's earlx
"problems." if that's the term
you want to use fora few pre
dictable losses and one ama/ing
shooting performance In BYI .
can be attributed more to the
Cardinal's youth and inexperi
ence and the Pac-l()'s remark
able parity than to any lac k of
talent or skill.
In fact, bv the end of the year
these "losers." as 1 sarcastic alh re
ferred to them, could easih win
the Pac-1() and make it deep into
the NCAA Tournament.
Hell, when Arizona won the
NCAA title in 1997, it finished
lilth in the Pac-1 (land was only a
No. f> seed, line, the Wildcats
had a lc\\ NBA players on that
roster. But in case you haven't

been watching, Stanford has a
lew, too. (lase\ [acobsen (consen
sus first-team All-American),
( in lis Borcharclt (\entnring into
top-10 NBA prospect lists) and
|osh Childress (McDonald's Ail-
American) are but the most obvi
ous candidates.
So hopefully you'll under
stand that the column wasn't
meant to bash an improving
team, but merely to bash those
fans (hat seem to breed in the
Sixth Man ranks: those who go
to games to be seen and not
heard, who don't mind inter
rupting a Stanford free throw
to lamely jeer an opponent,
who think that starting Web
sites intent on destroying the
confident e of a Stanford player
will somehow help the team
perform better and who know

onl\ that Duke, UCLA and Ari
zona are always good but have
no clue about the depth-ol the
rest of the conference or the
nation. Basically, those fans
who look at the No. 19 Cardi
nal as a disaster instead of a po
tentially beautiful work in
progress.
After this impassioned de
fense, you still might think the
column sucked. No sweat.
But even if you think it was
bad, I hope you'll at least recog
nize that it wasn't serious. Well,
except for that whole part about
aii balling baseline floaters on the
Wilbur Court. But that only hap
pened a couple of times.
Jonathan, a senior, loved all the angry
e-mails he received last week. Send him
