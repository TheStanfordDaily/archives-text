## 
### SARAH SCHULMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Colorful costumes, expressive movements
and distinctive music take center stage this
week as 50 dancers from Colima University's
renowned ballet folklorico company arrive on
campus. The troupe will conduct workshops
and perform for students and the Stanford
community through Saturday night.
To celebrate the dance company's West
Coast premiere, Colima University President
Carlos Sala/ar will address issues in higher ed
ucation today .it noon in the Bolivar I louse.
"His talk will be in Spanish and will discuss

the public university system in Mexico," said
Amy Upgren, communications direc tor for the
Center for Latin American Studies.
"It promises to be an interesting lecture,"
she said. "I Ic's requested a variety of multime
dia equipment for the presentation. I he ballet
folklorico event gave him the opportunity to
share his work with all of us."
Sophomore Lupe Mores, co-chair of Ballet
folklorico de Stanford, said the events figure to
be a fusion of different styles and dance meth
ods. Each region of Mexico encompasses its
own music and costumes and brings something
new to the folklorico world.
"We're really excited about all that's happen

ing this week," Mores said. "We want to learn
from them and just be exposed to the different
methods of dance. They will host a workshop
for us and give us a taste of their unique ap
prc >ach."
Susan Cashion, a senior lecturer in dance, is
the driving force behind this week's festivities.
Cashion has long been working to bring the
group to the Bay Area.
"I believe in this company so much," Cash
ion told the Stanford Report. " They're the most
stunning image of what the dance art of Mexi
co has become."
Colima University's ballet folklorico ensem
ble has represented Mexico in three Olympic
games and won first prize at the 21st Interna
tional Congress of Folklore. Their modern
technique distinguishes them from man) other
folklorico groups.
" They are semi-professional. They have a
heavy focus on ballet and do really difficult
movements," Mores said. "It's more vivid, more
modern and even more bright."
Beginning Friday, the troupe will put on two
one-hour concerts at 10a.m. and 12:30 p.m. for
kindergarten through 12th-grade students. ()n
Saturday, performances are scheduled for 2
p.m and 8 p.m at Memorial Auditorium.
"It's going to be an amazing performance.
We've been preparing for their visit for months, so
it's nice to see all our work ac tualized," Mores said.
"They draw quite a crowd wherever they go."
Despite the steep $70,000 price tag for 112 und
ing the series of events, Cashion believes wide
spread support — in the form of ticket sales
and sponsorships — will enable all costs to be
recovered.
"'These young dancers represent the her
itage of the Mexican c ulture in California," she
said. "I would estimate that hundreds of people
will come from all over the state to see 1.1 Ballet
folklorico de la Universidad de Colima."
