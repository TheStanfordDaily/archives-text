After the assassination of King in 1968, the Uni
versity held a campus-wide assembly to discuss racism
and its far-reaching consequences. During the assem
bly, while then-Provost Richard Lyman was address

came on stage and took the microphone from him.
The students issued 10 demands for ratial equali
ty and academic reform before leaving the stage to a
standing ovation.
As a result of their actions, Stanford slat ted its first
ethnic programs in African and African-American
Studies. In addition, many groups formed that were

inspired [the group ol 70 students] and others at Stan
ford to create social change that has had a lasting ef
fect," said |an Barker-Alexander, director of the
Black Communit\ Services Center.
Among the student demands were increasing mi
