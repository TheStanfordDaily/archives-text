Holiday slide sinks
nations third-largest
discount retail chain
DETROIT (AP) — Kmart
C .orp., the discount chain that gave
America the Blue Light Special and
introduced Martha Stewart home
fashions at cut-rate prices, filed for
Chapter 1 1 bankruptcy yesterday.
Kmart becomes the biggest re
tailer in history to seek court pro
tection from creditors.
The nation s No. 3 discounter
had long struggled to compete
with Wal-Mart and 'Target, and
went into an alarmingly steep slide
after a disappointing holiday sea
son. Over the weekend, it failed to

pay its top food supplier $78 mil
lion.
Analysts said they expect Kmart
to close as many as 700 of its 2,114
U.S. stores. Kmart said only that it
will close weak stores and t hat it ex
pects to emerge from Chapter 1 1
next year.
"We are determined to com
plete our reorganization as cjnic kly
and smoothly as possible," chief
executive Chuck Conaway said.
Kmart, which has 275,000 em
ployees, said it has secured $2 bil
lion in financing to keep going.
On the New York Stock Ex
change, Kmart stock dropped 60
percent yesterday, or $1.04, to
close at 70 cents. Its stock had trad
ed as high as $13.55 last summer.
By the time Kmart figures out

its business strategy, customers
may have found somewhere else
to shop. Analysts said filing for
bankruptcy means the shelves are
not going to be fully stocked,
something Kmart is already
struggling with.
"You're going to frustrate cus
tomers and they're going to go and
it's going to be hard to get them
back," said Emme Kozloff with
Bernstein Sanford.
The first Kmart discount store
was founded in 1962 and the chain
got its official corporate badge in
1977, when the S.S. Kresge Co.
changed its name to Kmart Corp.
Kmart introduced the Blue-
Light Special in 1965, flashing blue
police ligfits in the aisles to lure cus
tomers to discounted items.
