"Women at Work" series, will be followed by the
"Empowerment at Work" workshop on 1 uesda\
and"The Changing Face of Working Families:
Fathers and Mothers at Work" next Thursday.
"Our hope is that anyone who attends a
Women at Work event comes away with a
more informed sense of the issues that still
come into play regarding women in the work
force," said senior Lydia Poon, academic and
career program coordinator at the Women's
(Center. "While some events are geared toward
skill-building and practical advice, the series as
a whole is meant to provoke thought."
1 belay''s talk will address the needs and con
cerns of women working in academics. Pan
elists include English Prof. Paula Moya, Asian
Languages Prof. Yoshiko Matsumoto and Po
litical Science Prof. Claudine Cay.

"'l'he inspiration for the 'Women of (lolor in
Academia' panel really came out of some multi
cultural focus groups the Women's ( immuni
ty Center conducted during the fall quarter,"
said Women's Center Director Laura I larrison.
According to Harrison, feedback from stu
dents at the Women's (lenter demonstrated that
graduate students of color were interested in
learning about women of color working in acad
emics. In response, the center created the panel.
Fhe "Empowerment at Work" workshop,
sponsored by the Graduate Women's Net
work, will address a range of issues that women
face at work, including how to negotiate
salaries, interact with co-workers and supervi
sors and deal with sexual harassment.
According to I larrison," Fhe inspiration for
this program came from feedback received
both at the [Career Development Center] and
the WCC in which women students expressed
interest in practical, hands-on, skill-building
activities designed to facilitate the skillful navi
gation of the workplace."
" Fhe Changing Face of Working Families:
Fathers and Mothers at Work," was featured in
last year's series, though this year the panel will

include males as well as females.
"We believe that this is not just a women's
issue but is a men's issue as well," said
Stephanie Eberle, graduate career counselor
at the (IDC.
Fhe panelists, working women and men,
will speak about balancing work and family as
well as succeeding in one's career while priori
tizing the family.
"Balancing work and family is an issue that
many Stanford community members are
thinking about more and more," Poon said.
"Women of (iolor in Academia" will begin at
noon in the Women's Center.
