# Malaria genome gets fully mapped
## Breakthrough may lead to development of critical vaccine 
### NAEL FAKHRY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the help of Stanford's
Biochemistry and Genetics re
search departments, the I)NA se
quence of malaria — one of the
world's most lethal diseases —
has finally been mapped out.
I he breakthrough may pro
vide the pharmaceutical industry
with a plethora of information
for research and vaccine devel
opment.
I he University, along with the
Wellcome Trust Sangre Insti
tute, a United Kingdom-based
research center, and the Institute
for Genome Research in
Rockville, Md., led the four-year
project. 112
Funding flowed mostly from
the Wellcome Institute, while
the U.S. Defense Department
provided a smaller sum of
money to the Institute for
Genome Research. An estimat
ed $:i0 million went to sequenc
ing the DNA, according to Ge
net its and Biochemistry Prof.
Ronald Davis.
According to Davis, who was
heavily involved in the project,
the goal was to map out the DNA
sequence of malaria by cloning
pieces of the parasite's DNA.
Davis explained that the teams
from Stanford, the U.K. and
Maryland encountered problems
from the beginning.
"It's very tough to clone
| malaria] DNA," he said. "The
base composition makes it very
hard to work well [with the dis
ease]."
However, Davis emphasized
that the atmosphere of free-flow
ing ideas and the sharing of infor
mation among the teams were in
tegral to the success of the project.
Stanford's role involved
mapping out the sequence of
one chromosome of malaria
DNA. I he Wellcome Institute
ftind the Institute for Genome

Research handled the rest of
the chromosomes for the DNA
sequencing.
In spite of the technical
problems with cloning the
malaria DNA and a host of "po
litic al problems due to the delay
in releasing information" about
the project's progress, Davis
said he is confident that results
of the research will have a sig
nificant impact in the fight
against malaria.
1 lie broader goal of the project
\v;is to generate an abundance of
information that can help re
searchers develop drugs to fight
the disease, according to Davis.
Malaria is a parasite that cur
rently afflicts up to 500 million
people and kills approximately
10 million people per year,
most of whom are around four
years old.
Spread by mosquitoes, the dis
ease is most prevalent in the trop
ics of Africa and Southeast Asia.
The key to fighting the illness, ac
cording to most experts, lies in
developing a combination of very
effective drugs and a vaccine. Re
searchers hope that mapping the
DNA sequence will provide the
necessary breakthrough.
According to Genetics and
Medicine Prof. Russ Altman,
"Getting the malaria genome is
the first important step in under
standing how this parasite
works . . . It's been very difficult
to deal with in laboratories be
cause it . . . only likes to grow in
humans and insects."
So far, the light against malar
ia has been difficult for two main
reasons, Davis added. The para
site has become very resistant to
drugs because it evolves so rapid
ly and often lies dormant until it
attacks the body again.
In addition, malaria in the
U.S. and Europe has been eradi
cated. with only people in the
poorest parts of the world still
suffering from the disease.
As a result, most of malaria's
victims cannot afford any drugs,
so drug companies simply do
not have the incentive to pro
duce drugs for which they will
not be naid.
