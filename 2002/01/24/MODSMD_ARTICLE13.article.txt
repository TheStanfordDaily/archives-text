### 
EWING, N.J. (AP) — After four monilis
without an arrest, federal authorities yesterday
doubled the reward to $2.5 million for infor
mation leading to the c apture of whoever sent
four letters tainted with anthrax.
()lfi( i;ils also said they will send fliers to more
than 500,000 people in New Jersey and Penn
sylvania asking for help.
" I his individual responsible for this may well
he a neighbor, may well be a work associate," said
Kevin Burke of the Postal Inspection Service.
I lie fliers, which include pictures of the
tainted envelopes, will be sent to residents in
Bucks County, Pa., and in central New Jersey,
where the letters were processed at the- 1 Jamil
ton postal installation.
I'lie FBI hopes someone will recognize the
handwriting or the type of embossed, M-cenl
envelope used. Officials believe the culprit has
a scientific background and is familiar with the
Trenton area.
"We're reaching out to you to ensure there
are no more victims," FBI agent Kevin Dono-

van said. "I don't believe this person is as elusive
as the Unabomber."
Authorities declined to reveal specifics of
the probe.
"It's not that we don't have leads," Donovan
s;iid. "We're looking for that person out there
who might have information."
fhe reward money includes $2 million from
the FBI and the Postal Service and $500,000
from direct inailc;r Advo Inc.
Five people died of anthrax last year — in
cluding two postal workers — and more than a
do/en people were infected.
I he tainted letters — sent t<» NBC anchor
man Tom Brokaw, the New York Post and two
U.S. senators — were postmarked in Trenton
in September and October and went through
the Hamilton facility. Officials believe other
people were infected through cross-contamina
tion in the mail.
Anthrax contamination has kept the I lamilton
facilitv closed and forced the closing of a Senate of
fice building for three months. The I l.u t Senate

Office Building, home to half of the 100 senators,
reopened Tuesday after ii was fumigated.
Since the first cases of anthrax were identi
fied last fall, more than 15,000 anthrax hoaxes
and threats had been reported to the postal ser
vile, Burke said. More than 540 post offices
have been closed as a result and 71 people have
been arrested, he said.
Investigators said earlier (his week some sci
entific clues appeared promising. Scientists
hope identifying genetic markers will allow
them to trace the anthrax used in the attacks to
one of about a do/en labs that had samples of
the commonly held Ames strain.
Until now, no differences among the various
anthrax samples had been pinpointed. But sci
entists at the Institute for Genetic Research in
Rockville, Md., now say there appear to be a few
subtle genetic variations between two anthrax
samples they are comparing: anthrax used in a
Florida attack and anthrax held by a British lab
that originally received its sample from a U.S.
Army lab at Fort Detrick, Md.
