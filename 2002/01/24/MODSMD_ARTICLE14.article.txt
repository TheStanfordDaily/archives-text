## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU elections chief must restore integrity 
### 
Published Since IS')I

Last spring, the ASM uncannih im
personated the election ol Novem
ber 2000, proving that disorganiza
tion, partisanship and lack of ac
countability are not the ex< Insive domain of
the federal government. In lact, the 2001
ASSI elections were mavbe ;i bit too dose to
real-life political maneuvering, with ;ill the
squabbles and accusations of foul plav of a
bona fide presidential ele< tion.
So while many students received the news of
the appointment of a new ASSI elet tionscom
missioner vesterday with little, if anv, interest
for the ASSI , this move is ci itical to restoring
the integrity of its election process aftei a year
that could onlv be dubbed a disaster.
Junior Gedioen Aloula, the new commis

sioner, will have his hands full in regaining
the confidence of student groups and stu
dent voters in the ASSU and its election pro
cess. However, we are confident that, by
heeding the lessons of the past year, Aloula
and the commissioners he appoints will be
able to run a smooth and successful election
in the spring.
Ihe commission's biggest concern this
election year should be its relationship with
the students that it serves. I he commission
failed to concentrate on this last year, which
led to such dissatisfaction with the process.
Specifically, the commission needs to place a
priority on its communication with student
groups applying for special fees.
One of the integral functions of the ASSU

is its allocation of special fees to dozens of wor
thy student groups. Last year, however, a lack
of communication and a seeming disregard
for the needs and concerns of student groups
led to a great deal of confusion and resent
ment. Aloula is as a member of one such stu
dent group, the Stanford Ethiopian Student
Union. Therefore, he is familiar with the
unique trials that student groups face in in
teracting with the ASSU.
I his year's commission should also be pre
pared to hold itself fully accountable for the
way the elections are run and any problems
that arise during its tenure. Running an elec
tion is a complicated process and glitches
sometimes do occur.
1 low ever, these issues become serious only

when the governing body — the ASSU —
refuses to take responsibility for them or seek
a resolution, which is exactly what last year's
commission did. This is unacceptable. Hope
fully Aloula will recognize that this approach
only compounds, not solves, such problems.
I he Daily is optimistic that the right com
bination of motivated, open-minded stu
dents on the ASSU Elections Commission
can reverse the disorganization and lack of
integrity that has plagued ASSU elections in
recent years.
In restoring a sense of professionalism and
fairness to its election process, the ASSU can
better serve the interests of the student body
as well as improve its own presence and rep
utation on campus.
