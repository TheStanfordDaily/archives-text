## Athletic apocalypse 
### 
Even week when I sit down to
write this column, I ti \ to think ol
recent events that have slunked
me, excited me or otlierwi.se
caused a reaction. Recently, however,
there have been too mail) things io< hoose
from in the spoils world alone, and 1 Ii
nall\ decided that I can't possihh he ex
pected to c hoose onh one of these i it h
topics with which to grace these pages
I herelore, in the spirit ol Sports Illustrat
ed, this week I give vou a list ol signs ih.it
an athletic apocalypse is upon us.

1) Baseball < out rat -
lion. I thought it was
stupid w hen I wrote an
entire column about the
issue last fall. 1 think it's
stupid now. Since I
ha\en l ( hanged in\
opinion, and sm< e — il
noii know anything
about the greatness of

baseball — \<>u shouldn't either, we'll
move on to the next sign.
2) Last week in I lie l),til\. |onathan
Stull wrote an article about how hard it is
to ( lieei for the current Stanford basket
ball team because of their piddling top
-20 ranking. His article was obvionslx sar
< asti< in lone (though he apparentl\
fooled ,i few ), and I know that i)• > self-re
specting Cardinal lan would evei sloop
so low as to insult an\ of Our teams, lint
the sad truth is that some fans do turn on
(heir own teams. Koi even New York
Yankees or Pittsburgh Steelers oi anoth
er team with rabid fans, there is a Char
lotte I lornets.
;'>) Speaking of which, the Charlotte
I lornets appear to be on the move to New
Orleans. I 'licit attendance has dropped
dismall) and (it\ voters vetoed a proposal
fora new arena. I lowever, let me tell \ou
something. I'm from Charlotte, and lot
nine years, the team played in front of 'MiH
consecutive sell-outs. I like the Hornets,
and Charlotte likes the Hornets. But
enough is enough. What ( hai l< »tte hates
are the owners, two idioti< gu\s named
Oeorge Shinn and Ray Wooldiidge.
I lungs have progressed to the point
where Charlotte feels that tl letting the
team go means getting rid of jokei s Shinn
and Wooldi idge. so be it.
I) College football had a post season
full of blowouts that bordered on absurd.
I he Rose Bowl (Miami beat Nebraska In
a s< ore of II) was a joke. ()regon made
Colorado look |i tst plain foolish (final
score HH-IO). Florida lore Maryland to
shreds (final score ~>()-2.'i). I leek, I lie clos
est game in the font Bowl ( hainptonship
Series games was LSI s 17- H victon
over Illinois in the Sugar Bowl. I'lie lop
four teams in the final rankings (Miami,
Oregon, Florida, and Icnnesscc) beat
their opponents by a combined score ol
l7C>-70. Where's the competition? Per
haps it's time to lake vet another good

look at the B( S s\ stem and consider its ef
fectiveness.
.")) Mike l yson just couldn't control
himself and started a brawl with Lennox
Lewis helore a press conlerence to pro
mote an upcoming light between the two
boxers. I lie press conference, to no one's
surprise, was <|iik kh cancelled. Note to
Mike: when trying to get your Nevada
boxing li( ense reinstated (and when it was
revoked in I lie- first place when you dec id
ed to gnaw on someone's ear during a
light), it is generally a bad idea to start
unnecessary fights, and then once things
have (alined down, to throw strings of ex
pletives at members ol the press.
(>) Notre I )ame keeps stealing m\ loot
ball coaches. First the\ lured (ieorge
O'Leary awa\ from ni\ old school, but
then it turned out ol (ieorge wasn't
<|uitc the upstanding and accomplished
c itizen we all thought he was and he got
lircd. I le was gone so c|uic kl\ that shirts
announcing, "By (ieorge, it's O'Leary"
are already collector's items. 1 n any case,
I could deal with all that. But then the
Fighting Irish have to gall to grab 1 v
tone Willingham awav from my new
school. 1 1 someone can please explain to
me why everyone wants to coach at
Notre Dame, I will be eternally grateful.
I ntil then, I propose that no college
football coach ever be allowed to watch
"Rudy" again.
7) Statisticians really need to find
something else to do with the time on
theii hands. I'm tired ol hearing about
how the poor Carolina Panthers set a
record this year for rac king up the most
< onsec utive losses in a single season (I.">).
It's one thing to keep track ola player's
battingaverage hitting left-handed in the
bottom ol tlie C>th inning of a night game
on artificial turfaftet Sept. 1 when the
wind is blowing in from right field at 4.2
miles per hour. That stal is useless, but ai
least it's not just sad. I lie 1 Panthers know
ihe\ suck. You don't have to rub it in
their faces.
H) North Carolina is facing exclusion
lioiu the \( AA toni name ni il the\ don't
li\ something and last. Since 1001, the
team has suffered through only a single
season with a winning percentage below
">OO. li s so bad that my brother, a fresh
man at I \(.. is regretting his decision to
become alar Heel. (OK, so maybe lie's
not, but I bet the thought crossed his
mind after their latest 30-point loss.)
So there you have it. Mv current list of
reasons — the bad, (lie absurd, and the
just plain ugly — why the sporting world
is c oming to an end as we know it. I ake
c over now.
