Clarifying an article on Israel speech
I'm w i iting in regards to a bit ol confu
sion in Omar Vlesarwi's critique of Yaron
Brook s speech on Israel. Most ol the in
digenous Palestinians Heel Israel proper in
1 018 — and e ertainh are not grateful for
their squalid living conditions in the Oc
cupied I erritories ol Cia/a and the West
Bank and i ehigec camps in |ordan, S\ via.
and I .ebanon. I lowever, there were a sub
stantial number of Arabs (c urrently 1S
pei c ent ol Israel's population) who stayed
within the Ik>rders t>l Israci proper. I liese
Israeli Arabs are c ili/ensol the Israeli slate
and, as sue h, aren't subjec I to the c I ice k
points, movement rest rid ions and gener
allv pooi conditions ol the Palestinians. Il
is ibis group ol Israeli Arabs to which
Brook was referring as grateful for the for
mation of Israel.

Gaudet responds to Rodger Whitney
I ;im shocked by the letter written by
K\e( utive Director of Student Mousing
Services Rodger Whitney in defense of the
(.l iiduate I lousing (Mice's refusal to turn
on the heat in graduate student apart
ments. I lis letter is filled with misinforma
tion. Alumnus \Vinthrop Keis was right to
call fbi Diane (lonklin's resignation and it
appeats, now, tli.it we should investigate
Whitney's conduct .is well.
First, Whitney says the heating system
b;is the "capability" of providing 70 to NO
degrees of beat. I hat is not enough. I lie
Santa Clara County Building Inspection
Office says every campus dwelling must
have at least 70 degrees of heat.
My apartment fell into the 50s and (iOs
during many days in September, Octo
ber, and November. That's against Cali
fornia law.
In light of Whitney's and Conklin's in
transigence, I have filed a complaint with
the Santa Clara County Building Inspec
tion ( >ffice. I hey told me we are entitled to
70 degrees of heat, or more, and a ther
mostat that works.
Al Alciati of the Santa Clara County
Building Inspection Office investi
gate. Any Stanford student with inade
quate heat (i.e., less than 70 degrees) or a
malfunctioning thermostat should report
her or his problem to Al Aliciati by e-mail
at al.alt iati(« pln.co.scl.ca.us or by phone
at (408)209-5712.

Second, Whitney claims that the heat
was turned on Oct. Hi. That is not true.
I he boiler underneath (W Abrams Court
was activated lor testing purposes in mid-
October. One technician is the primary
operator ol that boiler. I le told me it was
not fully turned 011 in late October or early
November. I le had not received an order
from the (Iraduate I lousing Ollice to turn
on the heat as late as mid-November. Ei
ther \\ hitney does not know what's going
on or he is misstating the truth.
I bird, Whitney says "once turned on
throughout campus housing, the heat
stays on lor the season." This may be true
lot undergraduate housing, but it is not
true lor certain graduate dorms, like
Abrams ('.ourt, which have their own sep
arate boilers.
In October, the boiler was turned up
and down within a few days. I asked the
technician, "why <lid the heal go down?"
I le said someone turned the boiler down.
"Who did it." I asked.
lie said another technician must've
turned down the boiler. He offered to
turn it up and atta< ha note saying, "do not
turn down."
Fourth, information provided by the
I S. Dept. ol Labor's Bureau of Labor
Statistics demonstrates the price of resi
dential natural gas dropped throughout
2001. Residential natural gas is used inside
the boilers, according to Facilities Supervi
sor Rani Ponce. When lie mentions rising
prices, Whitney refers to "fiscal year
2001, which does not coinc ide with calen
dar year 2001.
In this academic year, the Bureau's
statistics show declining prices. These
statistics contradict flyers and e-mail mes
sages posted by ( onklin in December slat
ing that the I niversity was suffering from
