In today's sports world, accolades like super
star and go-to-guys are thrown around per
haps like never before, as the media seems
to hype up each player in a given game as
God's gif t to sports. If you ever have listened to
Dick Vitale cover a college basketball game, you
would think that nine out of 10 guys on the court
at all times are Ail-Americans, since everyone is a
bona tide PTP-er with their Super Scintillating

Spectacular performances.
In the last 10 years, how
many second-year NBA players
have been called the next
Michael Jordan? About a hun
dred would be the answer, with
the group ranging from all-star
Vince Carter to all-time bust
Harold Minor (or Baby Jordan
as he was called during his five
minutes of lame).

What about all of the players deemed the next
Larry Bird — a group that probably includes
every white forward in the league that can shoot,
especially if they look like farm boys from Middle
America. I his trend doesn't just exist in basket
ball. I hink, wasn't it five games into Jake Hum
mer's NFL career that he just had to be the rein
cat nation of Joe Montana?
()bviously all professional athletes are extreme
ly gifted, probably the top .01 percent of the pop
ulation in what they do. Kvery Majot League base
ball player was probably the best player on his
high school team, while every member of the NBA
probably excelled in collegiate basketball — if he
decided that college was even worth his time.
But, that being said, rarely does an athlete step
onto the playing field and consistently perform at
such a high level that he completely separates him
self from the rest of the competition, while at the
same time ( hanging the way the game is played.
This kind of athlete makes every member of
his team better and has an uncanny ability to step
up in the clutch and will his team to victory. Real
istically, this sort of athlete comes around once a
decade for each sport, and some undeniable ex
amples are people like Babe Ruth, Willie Mays,
Bill Russell. Michael Jordan, Jim Brown and
Lawrence Taylor.
Now that I've made it seem that all of the ath
letes like this are legends of the past, I'd like to
propose that there exists one such star right now,
and he's competing in the NFL playoffs. His
name is Donovan McNabb.
Perhaps I am just as guilty as all of the people
that I criticize for throwing around accolades and
hyping up every athlete on the field, but in my
view, McNabb is different. I le's unlike any quar
terback I've ever seen and the second most excit
ing football player I've ever watched for that mat-


Mac Levine
ter (a close second behind IT).
In only his third season, McN
abb has done more with the Eagles
than most people (ould ever - have
imagined. earning his team into
the plavofls last vear as a wild-card
,md this year winning tin- NI C"..
And on Sunday, the Eagles will
battle the heavih favored Rams to
see who gets to go to the Super
Bowl. Philadelphia obviously has a
good defense (the seventh-best in
the league), but as aw hole they are
without a doubt a one-man show,
and what a show M( \abb delivers.
Wit 1 i a pair ol starting receivers
that probabK wouldn't frighten
most Pac-10 secondaries — one
starter went undrafted out of Mis
souri Southern (lames Thrash)

and the other is probably skinnier
than I am ( I odd I'inkston) — Mc
\abb pi< ks apart opposing defens
es. s< rambling to bu\ enough lime
lor Ins receivers to get open (and
probabK even enough time for me
to get open).
At (>-foot-2 and 225 pounds, lie
has the speed, strength and ath
leticism (he also played basketball
at Syracuse) to out-run and over
power most linebackers, and that
is exact 1\ what he does. I low mam
times last week in C ihicago did vou
think that Bear defenders were
about ta( kle M( Nabb lor a loss in
the bat klield before he just plain
made them look stupid, running
side-to-side evading would-be
tacklers like he was playing Mad
den 2002, belore throwing pin
point passes to Kagles receivers.
Defenses have to blit/ him be
(ause if he gets too ninth time he'll
kill you, but il vou blit/, he'll pick

out I lie one-on-one (overage and
cat ii 111> lor breakfast.
However, what is most impres
sive about Mi Nabb is not his dual
ability to run and pass. It's his abil
itv to take over a game in the
fourth quarter, one unlike any
other player I've ever seen not
named Michael Jordan.
I lis iwo late-game comebacks
against (he Giants this season will
remain in my memory lor years to
come, and I have a bail feeling I
might just see it happen again. Mi-
Nabh just has that aura around
him, the aura ol winning, and it's
contagious, lie makes his team
mates believe they're going to win,
.ind the\ do. The scariest part
about it: lie's only 2f> and he's
going to get better.
To be completely honest, I
didn't think the Kagles as a team
were good enough to beat the
Hears, although I knew McNabb

would be the best player of the
field. In fact, I bet on the Bears,
and I am poorer because of it.
As great as I think Mi Nabb is, I
still don't like him in the "rooting"
sense (I'm a Giants fan so it's in my
blood to hate the Kagles). Kven so, I
think I learned my lesson: you can't
bet against someone like McNabb.
I le's just too good, and day-in
and day-ont he'll do things that
will continually amaze you. He
makes everyone around him bet
ter, even the defense with whom
he only shares a locker room. And
so, as much as I might want to bet
on the Rams, since they're at home
and their offense is straight out ol
1 ecino Super Bowl on the original
Nintendo, I can't. I'm not going to
lose am more money.
