## Larry Legend, MJ, the Babe and...D Mac?

In today's sports world, accolades like super
star and go-to-guys are thrown around per
haps like never before, as the media seems
to hype up each player in a given game as
God's gif t to sports. If you ever have listened to
Dick Vitale cover a college basketball game, you
would think that nine out of 10 guys on the court
at all times are Ail-Americans, since everyone is a
bona tide PTP-er with their Super Scintillating

Spectacular performances.
In the last 10 years, how
many second-year NBA players
have been called the next
Michael Jordan? About a hun
dred would be the answer, with
the group ranging from all-star
Vince Carter to all-time bust
Harold Minor (or Baby Jordan
as he was called during his five
minutes of lame).

What about all of the players deemed the next
Larry Bird — a group that probably includes
every white forward in the league that can shoot,
especially if they look like farm boys from Middle
America. I his trend doesn't just exist in basket
ball. I hink, wasn't it five games into Jake Hum
mer's NFL career that he just had to be the rein
cat nation of Joe Montana?
()bviously all professional athletes are extreme
ly gifted, probably the top .01 percent of the pop
ulation in what they do. Kvery Majot League base
ball player was probably the best player on his
high school team, while every member of the NBA
probably excelled in collegiate basketball — if he
decided that college was even worth his time.
But, that being said, rarely does an athlete step
onto the playing field and consistently perform at
such a high level that he completely separates him
self from the rest of the competition, while at the
same time ( hanging the way the game is played.
This kind of athlete makes every member of
his team better and has an uncanny ability to step
up in the clutch and will his team to victory. Real
istically, this sort of athlete comes around once a
decade for each sport, and some undeniable ex
amples are people like Babe Ruth, Willie Mays,
Bill Russell. Michael Jordan, Jim Brown and
Lawrence Taylor.
Now that I've made it seem that all of the ath
letes like this are legends of the past, I'd like to
propose that there exists one such star right now,
and he's competing in the NFL playoffs. His
name is Donovan McNabb.
Perhaps I am just as guilty as all of the people
that I criticize for throwing around accolades and
hyping up every athlete on the field, but in my
view, McNabb is different. I le's unlike any quar
terback I've ever seen and the second most excit
ing football player I've ever watched for that mat-
