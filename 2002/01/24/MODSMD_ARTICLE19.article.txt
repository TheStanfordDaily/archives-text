TRACK AND FIELD
Tomorrow-Saturday: Stanford
(Track) at Terrier Classic, Boston,
MA
Tomorrow: Stanford (Field) at
Husker Open, Lincoln, NE

Stanford's track sits less than a quar
ter mile from our ever-so-expensive
row of palm trees, testament to the
mild climate we Californians enjoy.
While we may not In- as warm as the
Canary Islands from whence the palms
came, Stanford's track nonetheless re
mains usable all year round.
For the less-fortunate souls in the
rest of the country, track and field in
the winter is not an option.
Snow and sub-zero temperatures
drive even the heartiest of collegiate
athletes inside for the NCAA indoor
track season.
Indoor tracks are 200 meters (half
the standard si/e) with banked turns,
creating a very different competitive
arena for runners.

The Stanford runners travels across
the country to these indoor meets, no
doubt reminding their fellow competi
tors that where they come from, they
don't have to run on these miniature
tracks.
This weekend, the Cardinal men's
team will split — the sprinters, jumpers
and throwers travel to Lincoln, Neb.,
for the Husker Open, while the dis
tance runners compete in Boston's
Terrier Classic.
Many of the distance athletes run
ning at Boston competed during the
cross-country season in the (all and
helped the Cardinal to a second-place
finish at the NCAA Championships.
While indoor track is a competitive
and important season in its own right,
it also serves as preparation for the
more prestigious outdoor season.
According to Vin Lananna, Director
of Track and Field, the indoor season
provides much-needed experience
during the large time block between
cross country and the outdoor track
season, in which there are few meets
for the athletes to prove themselves.
"There's a big difference between
training and competing," Lananna
said."' I liese meets are great practice at
being competitive."
I he athletes' immediate goal for
these first indoor meets is to attain an
automatic qualifying mark for the
NCAA Indoor Track Championships.
This goal docs not seem unreason
able, given the Cardinal's immense
amount of talent and an optimistic view
of its preparedness.
"We're definitely more fit coming
into the indoor season than we were last

year," said sophomore Chris I mme.
While Stanford's distance-running
rivals Colorado and Arkansas will not
compete in Boston, the Cardinal will still
have plenty ofcompetition to push team
members to their qualifying marks.
" There'll be some good competition
at the meet," said sophomore lan Dob
son. "Some post-collegiate runners will
make things interesting."
One such post-collegian will be
Stanford alum Brent 1 lauser, who will
join current members of the Cardinal
team, Dobson, Ktnme, juniors Seth
Hejny, Louis Luchini and Jesse
Thomas in the 3,000 meters.
Meanwhile, some of the Cardinal
sprinters, jumpers and throwers will be
at the Husker Open. The squad boasts
some of the best competitors in these
events.
Senior Stanley Wilson holds the sev
enth-fastest 100-meter time in school
history.
Junior Milton Little is the Pacific 10
Conference's top returning long
jumper, while junior and two-time Ail-
American Michael I'onikvar is one of
the nation's leading high jumpers, hav
ing plated eighth at last year's NCAA
()utdoor ( hampionships.
Junior All-American Omer Inan
posted an eighth-place finish in the dis
cus at last year's NCAAs, and junior
Nick YVelihozkiy plated second at the
Pac-10s in the hammer toss.
With a large number of returning
veterans leading a group of talented
newcomers, the Husker Open and
Terrier Classic promise to be the be
ginning of competitive, thrilling in
door and ouidoor track seasons.

cross-country season in the (all and
helped the Cardinal to a second-place
finish at the NCAA Championships.
While indoor track is a competitive
and important season in its own right,
it also serves as preparation for the
more prestigious outdoor season.
According to Vin Lananna, Director
of Track and Field, the indoor season
provides much-needed experience
during the large time block between
cross country and the outdoor track
season, in which there are few meets
for the athletes to prove themselves.
"There's a big difference between
training and competing," Lananna
said."' I liese meets are great practice at
being competitive."
I he athletes' immediate goal for
these first indoor meets is to attain an
automatic qualifying mark for the
NCAA Indoor Track Championships.
This goal docs not seem unreason
able, given the Cardinal's immense
amount of talent and an optimistic view
of its preparedness.
"We're definitely more fit coming
into the indoor season than we were last

year," said sophomore Chris I mme.
While Stanford's distance-running
rivals Colorado and Arkansas will not
compete in Boston, the Cardinal will still
have plenty ofcompetition to push team
members to their qualifying marks.
" There'll be some good competition
at the meet," said sophomore lan Dob
son. "Some post-collegiate runners will
make things interesting."
One such post-collegian will be
Stanford alum Brent 1 lauser, who will
join current members of the Cardinal
team, Dobson, Ktnme, juniors Seth
Hejny, Louis Luchini and Jesse
Thomas in the 3,000 meters.
Meanwhile, some of the Cardinal
sprinters, jumpers and throwers will be
at the Husker Open. The squad boasts
some of the best competitors in these
events.
Senior Stanley Wilson holds the sev
enth-fastest 100-meter time in school
history.
Junior Milton Little is the Pacific 10
Conference's top returning long
jumper, while junior and two-time Ail-
American Michael I'onikvar is one of
the nation's leading high jumpers, hav
ing plated eighth at last year's NCAA

Junior All-American Omer Inan
posted an eighth-place finish in the dis
cus at last year's NCAAs, and junior
Nick YVelihozkiy plated second at the
Pac-10s in the hammer toss.
With a large number of returning

newcomers, the Husker Open and
