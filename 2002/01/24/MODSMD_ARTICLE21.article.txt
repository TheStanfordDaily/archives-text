Since that day it's been a slow con

definitely happened that first day."

to where he is now, with a 14-8
record, two pins and 44.5 team

"I started wrestling when 1 was
about five years old," he said.
"Some <>l my (ondest memories
and what really got me hooked on
the sport was getting to travel
around with the high school team
when I was eight or nine."
Despite a brilliant high school
career, during which Weikel-Mag

onships, wrestling was not initially
part of his future plans.
"I knew I didn't want to go to
school and just be a student, but
I'd seen some stellar athletes go to

up. I didn't think that I would
add up."

only thinks about quitting when it's
time for morning practice," Levi
said. "II you're thinking about it
when the summertime comes and
you're thinking it would be so much
