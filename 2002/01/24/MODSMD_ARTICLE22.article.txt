I lie fact that Smyth is returning

Records of past competitions be
tween the two s( hools could be de
ceiving. Arizona State leads the reg
ulai season series against Stanford
14-3, hut the Cardinal has won two
out of the last three meetings.
If Stanford can keep improving
on its previous performances this
weekend, ii should prove to he an
exciting contest between the Cardi
nal and the Sun I )evils.
Fhanks to an impressive home
opener, Stanford moved back into
the rankings at No. 14, while Ari
zona State will enter the meet tin
ranked. I he Sun Devils were
ranked No. 19 last week, but due to

their loss to No. 2 I CLA they
dropped out of the rankings.
Stanford, however, is coining oil
a victor) after defeating Washing
ton at home in front of a sellout
c rowd. Ihe Cardinal had not per
formed in front of a home c rowd
that large since 1996.
Ihe 1,220 Stanford fans wit
nessed an impressive 193.925-
191.075 victory over the I luskies.
Ihe Cardinal heat Washington
in three of four categories to gain its
first victory of the season. On the
vault, the(Cardinal outscored Wash
ington 48.525-48.300, on the bars
48.625-46.525 and on floor exercis
es 48.500-47.550.
"1 am very pleased with how we
performed this weekend. I am espe
cially impressed with sophomores
Lindsey Wing and Kendall Beck.
They did an outstanding job,"
Smyth said.
Arizona State's disappointing loss
to UCLA came in every facet as the
Bruins destroyed ASU, 195.325-
192.125. I he Sun Devils lost in every
event with scores ol 48.500-47.600
on vault, 49.050-48.200 on bars,
48.500-47.300 on beam and 49.275-
49.025 on the floor.
"I am eager to go back to the
desert. Arizona State, led by head
coach John Spini, lias a great team,
Â«ind 11 lev will provide great competi
tion for us," Smyth said.
After Arizona Slate, the Cardi
nal will face a busy weekend line
up. On Friday. Feb. I. Stanford
will face l'ac-10 rivals Arizona at
home and then will turn around
two da\s later to compete against
I )enver, also at home.
"We need to work on completing
c leaner performances and tighter
executions," said Smyth. "We are
getting reach for upcoming c ompe
tit ions against highly ranked teams.
While these meets will be lough.
1 lies will onh make us better."
