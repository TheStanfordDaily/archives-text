# Team depth allows for fast-paced attack
## Arizona schools roll into town, hoping to spoil Card's season 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
Except for Cal, whom the
women's basketball team will play
next weekend, Stanford has met
with every other Pacific 10 Confer
ence rival.
And every time, the Cardinal
has won.
Decisively.
That was the easy part,
though. Now coach I'ara Van-
Derveer's squad must face those
teams again, beginning tonight
when it hosts Arizona.
The team (18-1, 8-0 Pac-10)
moved up the rankings to No. 3
this week for the first time since its
1990-97 Final Four season.
Along with undefeated and No.
I-ranked Connecticut and No. 2
Tennessee, the Cardinal is part of a
triumvirate dominating women's
hoops this season. Tennessee's only
loss this season at me from UC lonn,
while the Lady Vols dealt the Car
dinal its only defeat, making for an
extremely talented rind competitive
top three.
However, as the only ranked
team in the Pac-10, and after win
ning by an average of 2H points in
the first half of conference play,
the Cardinal has set itself up as the
team to beat.
The team will have to be espe
cially careful against the Wildcats
tonight â€” though Stanford de
feated Arizona (9-9, 5-4) in its Pac
-10 opener earlier this season 81-
57, the Wildcats have won the last
two played in Palo Alto.
Last year at Maples Pavilion,
Arizona forced the Cardinal to
commit 21 turnovers on its way to
a 08-05 road win.
I his time around, it will be up
to freshman point gtiard Kelley
Suminski to make sure history
doesn't repeat itself.
After two starts in December in

place of an injured sophomore
point guard Susan King, Sumins
ki stepped back into the starting
role for good following King's
season-ending ACL injury earlier
this season against the Wildcats in
Arizona. Suminski finished big in
that game, immediately making
her presence felt with a career
high 24 points.
Since that time, the freshman
point guard has played a vital role
in Stanford's up-tempo attack, av
eraging 10.4 points a game in con
ference play and leading the
league in three-point percentages
at .529.
Led largely by the play of
sophomore forward Nicole Pow
ell. who is averaging a double-dou
ble a contest, and senior guard
Lindsey Yamasaki, Stanford's
transition game has re-emerged
this season as the nail in its oppo
nents' coffins.
Beginning against Oregon
State, the Cardinal returned to
a fast-paced style reminiscent
of its championship teams in
the 19905, helping to wear
down opponents and increase
the energy on the court. Ihe
transition game has been fu
eled by the team's depth, which
has proven itself in every game
this season.
Senior center Cori Fnghusen
served a perfect example of such
depth this past weekend when
Stanford swept through the Ever
green State.
After coming ofF the bench in
both games, Fnghusen had a ca
reer-high 24 points last Thursday
against Washington State and con
tinued to dominate inside on Sat
urday against Washington, scor
ing 13 points in 1 1 minutes.
That road trip signaled a
turn-around in Enghusen's play
that could not have come at a
better time.
'If Cori plays like that, we could
win big," said VanDerveer.
Indeed, the inside play from
the 0-foot-7 senior will go a long

Senior Lauren St. Clair, who plays at both the guard and forward positions,
has provided solid minutes all year from the bench. She and other role play
ers have been key in bringing the Cardinal back among the best.
