# IT FEELS GOOD TO BE
## ON TOP ONCE AGAIN 
### MAUREEN MULLEN STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal women are back
—or that's what everyone is saying.
After whizzing to an 18-1
record, including a perfect mark in
Pacific 10 C Conference play, fans are
beginning to sit back, almost as if
their season woes in previous years
were all a facade.
Clearly Tara VanDerveer's
team is a permanent fixture among
the women's basketball power
houses. After dominating through
out most of the 1990s with the likes
of the Connections and Ten
nessee's, a three-season fall from
grace was hardly enough to be for
gotten in the minds of the women's
basketball world.
Things are once again as they
should be. Connecticut, Tennessee
and Stanford once again atop the
weekly polls — the I fuskies, seem
ingly untouchable with a perfect
record, the Volunteers with their
only loss coming tot lie No. 1 squad
and the Cardinal with their only
loss to Tennessee.
But is all this settling back into
traditional roles and patterns
what destroys all the fun of
women's basketball?
While the men's game has
Duke, which seems to find itself
in the No. 1 position ail-too often
for most college enthusiasts, the
Blue Devils aren't immortal, as
shown with a loss this season to
Florida State.
On the other hand, women's
basketball is still seen as a college
sports kingdom where only a select
few have the power to reign. I he
sport isn't helped by the fact that
only a dozen or so games are tele
vised annually, perpetuating the
belief to all but the diehard fan that
there only are a handful of teams
that actually play the game.
If parity builds a healthy fan
base, then it is clear that the
women's game has a long way
to go.
Last season, after a dismal 1-3
start in conference play, Coach
VanDerveer said something to the
effect that it is easy to build a pro
gram but extremely difficult to
maintain. Others might just want

to amend that statement, though.
While the Cardinal went through
some rough times, history isn't so
easily forgotten, and VanDerveer
continued to bring in a host of the
top high school recruits.
And if the same teams keep win
ning, keep plowing through the
NCAA tournament, keep getting
the I V deals and keep receiving
strong fan support, it would only
make sense that they would also
continue to attract the top players.
But like any developing sport,
the divide is shrinking in women's
basketball and one only needs to
look to last year's tournament, in
which Tennessee was knocked oil

early, a Jackie Stiles-led Southwest
Missouri State squad made the
Final Four and Notre Dame de
feated seemingly insurmountable
UConn for the 2001 crown, to see
that there might be a bit more ex
citement in the sport than com
monly perceived.
A quick glance through the cur
rent rankings yields a host of new
teams, from a smattering of confer
ences. With the exception of the
big three — UConn, Tennessee
and now the Cardinal, every team
has at least two or three losses, a
sign that there is some added bat
tling in the ranks.
However with that said, at this

point in the season, the I luskies re
main the overwhelming favorite
lor the national title, and it would
be mildly shocking if Tennessee
didn't at least find its way to the
Final Four.
So where does that leave the
Cardinal? Well, despite the lili par
ity might give women's basketball,
the team is more than content to
roll through its conference season
unscarred, rather than battle from
uncertain depths as it did the past
three seasons.
And while Stanford appears to
be on a cake walk through con
