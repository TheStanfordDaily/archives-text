# Cardinal out to prove its worth in Pac-10 play
## 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
I hey are men of few words right now.
When it comes clown to it, talk is cheap. Silence
is golden.
As the No. 19 Stanford men's basketball team
prepares to lake on Pacific 10 Conference giants
UCLA and Southern California, no one's saying a
word. Well, maybe a few.
"I want to win," said freshman Rob Little.
" There's nothing else to say."
At this point in the season it's almost better to
just shut up and play. No one wants to be respon

sible for saying the one quote that ends up posted
in an opponent's locker room or written on a
chalkboard over a maze of Xs and ()s.
So as the (Cardinal enters its toughest and most
crucial week of Pac-10 play tonight against No. 13
UCIA(I3-4) and then on Saturday against No. 22
US( 1 (14-3), nobody's saying much about it.
No hype is nec essary. (Joingdown and getting
two wins is all that really matters.
Everybody's got something to prove this week
end. Something to prove to themselves and some
thing to prove to the world.
UCIA wants to prove that last weekend's loss
to Arizona was a fluke; a lapse in character,
unindicative of self.
USC has got to prove that (lie past three
weeks of sitting atop the Pac-10 ladder was no
coincidence.
And for Stanford, proving something to
its critics has been a major theme this sea
son already.
I he Cardinal is out to prove that even though
it's not the team that it once was, it's still pretty
good. Potential needs to lie realized this weekend.
It can no longer exist in the abstract if Stanford is
to be a contender.
"If we could lake two clown there it would real
ly put us atop the league and right back in the
hunt lor a |Pac-10| Championship," said sopho
more shooting guard Matt Lottich. "We just have
to come to play."
When you think about ii, there probably
couldn't lx' a worse weekend to lake a trip down
to sunny Southern California. Arizona made sure
of thai last weekend by decisively taking clown the
two L.A. schools.
Both, needless to sav, were devastating losses.
UCIA had a 20-point lead with 13 minutes
to go in the second half, but somehow ended
the game 10 points short of victory. Mean
while, USC's Pac-10 record received its first
blemish to date.
I hese losses w ill definitely affect the psyches of
1 m »th teams. Bui in what way?

It's doubtful, but mavbe the I rojans and the
Bruins are wallowing in their pitiful existences.
Maybe Arizona exposed their weaknesses to
I he world.
Bui most probably. Ix>th teams are waiting to
get back on thccourt.cagei to erase the memories
of last weekend, knowing now thai the\ are not
unbeatable.
Thanks, Arizona!
I his entire season has been about the Cardi
nal's apparent search foi identity. And u has no
doubt been a battle thus far.
For Stanford, this weekend is al>out gauging

in the conference. People have said
t lie team is not what it used to be —
that a Pac-10 title is nowhere in
reach. But until this point, it has all

Stanford knows it is capable of
competing with the (JSCs and
I CIAs. II le game against Michigan
Slate, the oh-so-closc bouts with
Texas and Oregon and the recent
dominating victories over the Wash

What has yet to be seen is a
consistent, trustworthy Cardinal
team that erases doubt from on

games are huge and both [I A.]
teams are playing realh well. We've

tinue to build on that."

matchups to watch out for. On
Thursday against UCIA, watch as

itself with the other top-tier teams
in the conference. People have said
t lie team is not what it used to be —
that a Pac-10 title is nowhere in
reach. But until this point, it has all
been speculation.
Stanford knows it is capable of
competing with the (JSCs and
I CIAs. II le game against Michigan
Slate, the oh-so-closc bouts with
Texas and Oregon and the recent
dominating victories over the Wash
ington schools attest to that.
What has yet to be seen is a
consistent, trustworthy Cardinal
team that erases doubt from on
lookers' eyes.
Even though they aren't doing
much talking, all oft he players know
how important these next couple of
days are.
"It's a big weekend," said fresh
man ( Jiris 1 lernandez. " I hese two
games are huge and both [I A.]
teams are playing realh well. We've
got to come out and match that in

tcnsitv. We have a two-game win
ning streak and we haven't had that
lor a while. I lopefiilly we can con
tinue to build on that."
Hut this weekend is about more
than just winning streaks.
Aside from all (he hype sur
rounding it, there are some key
matchups to watch out for. On
Thursday against UCIA, watch as
the two freshman point guards,
Stanford's Chris Hernandez and
I ( LYs (ledric Boozetnan go head
to head. There's also the much-an
tic ipat cd battle I >et ween shooting ex
perts Casey Jacobsen and Jason
Rapona. And down low, fans will get
to see Curtis Bore hardt battle a com
parable defensive presence in Dan
(iadzuric.
Against I S( i, look to see how the
Cardinal handles senior Sam Clan
cy, a (j-loot-7, 240-pound forward
who's coming off a 30-point game
against Arizona.
Bui regardless of matchups and
strategies, things are simple now.
AVe need to win this," said
sophomore forward Teyo Johnson.
'AVe need to reestablish ourselves at
I he top of the I'ac-lO."
I hey are men of few words right now.
When it comes clown to it, talk is cheap. Silence
is golden.
As the No. 19 Stanford men's basketball team
prepares to lake on Pacific 10 Conference giants
UCLA and Southern California, no one's saying a
word. Well, maybe a few.
"I want to win," said freshman Rob Little.
" There's nothing else to say."
At this point in the season it's almost better to
just shut up and play. No one wants to be respon

sible for saying the one quote that ends up posted
in an opponent's locker room or written on a
chalkboard over a maze of Xs and ()s.
So as the (Cardinal enters its toughest and most
crucial week of Pac-10 play tonight against No. 13
UCIA(I3-4) and then on Saturday against No. 22
US( 1 (14-3), nobody's saying much about it.
No hype is nec essary. (Joingdown and getting
two wins is all that really matters.
Everybody's got something to prove this week
end. Something to prove to themselves and some
thing to prove to the world.
UCIA wants to prove that last weekend's loss
to Arizona was a fluke; a lapse in character,
unindicative of self.
USC has got to prove that (lie past three
weeks of sitting atop the Pac-10 ladder was no
coincidence.
And for Stanford, proving something to
its critics has been a major theme this sea
son already.
I he Cardinal is out to prove that even though
it's not the team that it once was, it's still pretty
good. Potential needs to lie realized this weekend.
It can no longer exist in the abstract if Stanford is
to be a contender.
"If we could lake two clown there it would real
ly put us atop the league and right back in the
hunt lor a |Pac-10| Championship," said sopho
more shooting guard Matt Lottich. "We just have
to come to play."
When you think about ii, there probably
couldn't lx' a worse weekend to lake a trip down
to sunny Southern California. Arizona made sure
of thai last weekend by decisively taking clown the
two L.A. schools.
Both, needless to sav, were devastating losses.
UCIA had a 20-point lead with 13 minutes
to go in the second half, but somehow ended
the game 10 points short of victory. Mean
while, USC's Pac-10 record received its first
blemish to date.
I hese losses w ill definitely affect the psyches of
1 m »th teams. Bui in what way?

It's doubtful, but mavbe the I rojans and the
Bruins are wallowing in their pitiful existences.
Maybe Arizona exposed their weaknesses to
I he world.
Bui most probably. Ix>th teams are waiting to
get back on thccourt.cagei to erase the memories
of last weekend, knowing now thai the\ are not
unbeatable.
Thanks, Arizona!
I his entire season has been about the Cardi
nal's apparent search foi identity. And u has no
doubt been a battle thus far.
For Stanford, this weekend is al>out gauging
