### CAROLYN LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he I niversitv announced yesterday
that two housed fraternities, Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Alpha Kpsilon, have been
plat ed on housing probation through De
cember 2002.
According to Assoc. Director of Resi
dential Education John |uclic ki, the hous
ing probation, a policy implemented last
year as part of the University's new Greek
11< >using ( riteria, became effective Jan. 7,
following a I niversit\ review of'all housed
fraternities and sororities to determine
their annual status.
Senior Mark Vela, president of SAL,
identified three main areas of concern that
his fraternity must address: meeting occu
pancy requirements, providing communi
ty service and organizing Res Ed programs.
"We've had some extenuating circum
stances [concerning occupancy] recently,
where we've had members leave because
of severe illnesses, stud) ing abroad or pur
suing professional sports," Vela said.

"We're a little frustrated that a lot oft his
happened two or three years ago when we
weren't even living in the house," he said.
I lowever, he added that with the privilege
ol "premier" housing on the row comes
responsibilities and obligations that the or
ganization will address.
SAE has hosted several recent ac adem
ic programs and community service
events, including a talk with Vice Provost
lor Undergraduate Education John Brav
man and a blood drive, which took place
yesterday in the fraternity's house.
Kappa Sig also faces similar chal
lenges regarding oc cupanc y and service
oriented activities. In response to its pro
bation, the organization has implement
ed two community service projects in
conjunction with Palo Alto Urban Min
istries and the Bing Nursery School, ac
cording to Kappa Sig vice president
Rahul Dhillon, a senior.
"There are so many opportunities at
Stanford that 100 percent occupancy is
hard to keep," noted senior Martin Ruano,
Interfraternity (louncil president and resi
dent assistant in the Kappa Sig house.
"People can go off to play pro baseball or
start their own dot-com companies."
Kappa Sig has also set up an alumni
board to improve alumni relations and a
rush committee that will address occupan

c v concerns, Ruano said.
l he fraternities must submit action
plans addressing the targeted areas by Feb.
1. With the assistance of the Greek 1 lousing
Review Board, the groups will implement
those plans in the next six weeks.
At the end oftlu ee quarters in fall 2002,
the review board will assess each chapter's
progress and then determine whether the
probation w ill be removed or extended, or
if further action will be taken, according to
Res Ed officials.
"II probation is extended, certain areas
for improvement will be identified," said
Asst. Dean and Director of Student Activi
ties Nanc i I lowe.
According to |udicki, it is possible that
the review board will elect to strip either or
both of the fraternities of their houses.
"II 'the board makes a recommendation
