### CAROLYN LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he I niversitv announced yesterday
that two housed fraternities, Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Alpha Kpsilon, have been
plat ed on housing probation through De
cember 2002.
According to Assoc. Director of Resi
dential Education John |uclic ki, the hous
ing probation, a policy implemented last
year as part of the University's new Greek
11< >using ( riteria, became effective Jan. 7,
following a I niversit\ review of'all housed
fraternities and sororities to determine
their annual status.
Senior Mark Vela, president of SAL,
identified three main areas of concern that
his fraternity must address: meeting occu
pancy requirements, providing communi
ty service and organizing Res Ed programs.
"We've had some extenuating circum
stances [concerning occupancy] recently,
where we've had members leave because
of severe illnesses, stud) ing abroad or pur
suing professional sports," Vela said.

"We're a little frustrated that a lot oft his
happened two or three years ago when we
weren't even living in the house," he said.
I lowever, he added that with the privilege
ol "premier" housing on the row comes
responsibilities and obligations that the or
ganization will address.
SAE has hosted several recent ac adem
ic programs and community service
events, including a talk with Vice Provost
lor Undergraduate Education John Brav
man and a blood drive, which took place
yesterday in the fraternity's house.
Kappa Sig also faces similar chal
lenges regarding oc cupanc y and service
oriented activities. In response to its pro
bation, the organization has implement
ed two community service projects in
conjunction with Palo Alto Urban Min
istries and the Bing Nursery School, ac
cording to Kappa Sig vice president
Rahul Dhillon, a senior.
"There are so many opportunities at
Stanford that 100 percent occupancy is
hard to keep," noted senior Martin Ruano,
Interfraternity (louncil president and resi
dent assistant in the Kappa Sig house.
"People can go off to play pro baseball or
start their own dot-com companies."
Kappa Sig has also set up an alumni
board to improve alumni relations and a
rush committee that will address occupan

c v concerns, Ruano said.
l he fraternities must submit action
plans addressing the targeted areas by Feb.
1. With the assistance of the Greek 1 lousing
Review Board, the groups will implement
those plans in the next six weeks.
At the end oftlu ee quarters in fall 2002,
the review board will assess each chapter's
progress and then determine whether the
probation w ill be removed or extended, or
if further action will be taken, according to
Res Ed officials.
"II probation is extended, certain areas
for improvement will be identified," said
Asst. Dean and Director of Student Activi
ties Nanc i I lowe.
According to |udicki, it is possible that
the review board will elect to strip either or
both of the fraternities of their houses.
"II 'the board makes a recommendation

for ilie loss of housing |for the fra
ternities], there will he a transi
tionary process during whieh the
organizations will he phased out of
the houses," he said.
Still, Judicki stressed that such
an extreme move is unlikely.
"Our goal is to work |with the
fraternities] to gel them to be a
model in terms of what the Univer

sity expects of organizations ili.it
are housed," he said. "We've met
with the leadership and the entire
(ireek groups to make sure we're
on the same page in terms of how
to move forward."
Despite the challenges, mem
bers of the fraternities expressed
optimism in regards to both work
ing with Res I'd and the future of
their organizations.
"We feel that the process has
been fail ," Dhillon said. "We are
disappointed that our mistakes
iu the distant past continue to

hamper our ability to move for
ward. We feel, however, that the
University was justified in its de
rision and we see this as an op
portunity to improve our mem
bers' participation and presence
on campus."
Vela agreed, calling the proba
tionary period a "motivating forte
for the entire chapter that has
heightened awareness of needed
improvements in these areas."
"I am confident that our current
officer tore is not only capable, but
also proactive, and I have no doubt

that we will take the appropriate ac
tions to remove the probationary
status of our house and put
processes in place to ensure conti
nuity and continued progress in
the future," Vela said.
Fraternity members also said
they are enthusiastic alw>ut the up
coming Rush season, which may
prove critical to the groups' futures.
"We're going to be able to say to
the rushees, 'You're going to a big
part of these changes and improve
ments. something really important
to the organization,' " Ruano said.

hard to keep," noted senior Martin Ruano,
Interfraternity (louncil president and resi
dent assistant in the Kappa Sig house.
"People can go off to play pro baseball or
start their own dot-com companies."
Kappa Sig has also set up an alumni
board to improve alumni relations and a
rush committee that will address occupan

c v concerns, Ruano said.
l he fraternities must submit action
plans addressing the targeted areas by Feb.
1. With the assistance of the Greek 1 lousing
Review Board, the groups will implement
those plans in the next six weeks.
At the end oftlu ee quarters in fall 2002,
the review board will assess each chapter's
progress and then determine whether the
probation w ill be removed or extended, or
if further action will be taken, according to
Res Ed officials.
"II probation is extended, certain areas
for improvement will be identified," said
Asst. Dean and Director of Student Activi
ties Nanc i I lowe.
According to |udicki, it is possible that
the review board will elect to strip either or
both of the fraternities of their houses.

for ilie loss of housing |for the fra
ternities], there will he a transi
tionary process during whieh the
organizations will he phased out of
the houses," he said.
Still, Judicki stressed that such
an extreme move is unlikely.
"Our goal is to work |with the
fraternities] to gel them to be a
model in terms of what the Univer

sity expects of organizations ili.it
are housed," he said. "We've met
with the leadership and the entire
(ireek groups to make sure we're
on the same page in terms of how
to move forward."
Despite the challenges, mem
bers of the fraternities expressed
optimism in regards to both work
ing with Res I'd and the future of
their organizations.
"We feel that the process has
been fail ," Dhillon said. "We are
disappointed that our mistakes
iu the distant past continue to

hamper our ability to move for
ward. We feel, however, that the
University was justified in its de
rision and we see this as an op
portunity to improve our mem
bers' participation and presence
on campus."
Vela agreed, calling the proba
tionary period a "motivating forte
for the entire chapter that has
heightened awareness of needed
improvements in these areas."
"I am confident that our current
officer tore is not only capable, but
also proactive, and I have no doubt

that we will take the appropriate ac
tions to remove the probationary
status of our house and put
processes in place to ensure conti
nuity and continued progress in
the future," Vela said.
Fraternity members also said
they are enthusiastic alw>ut the up
coming Rush season, which may
prove critical to the groups' futures.
"We're going to be able to say to
the rushees, 'You're going to a big
part of these changes and improve
ments. something really important
to the organization,' " Ruano said.
I he I niversitv announced yesterday
that two housed fraternities, Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Alpha Kpsilon, have been
plat ed on housing probation through De
cember 2002.
According to Assoc. Director of Resi
dential Education John |uclic ki, the hous

year as part of the University's new Greek
11< >using ( riteria, became effective Jan. 7,
following a I niversit\ review of'all housed
fraternities and sororities to determine
their annual status.
Senior Mark Vela, president of SAL,
identified three main areas of concern that
his fraternity must address: meeting occu
pancy requirements, providing communi
ty service and organizing Res Ed programs.
"We've had some extenuating circum
stances [concerning occupancy] recently,
where we've had members leave because
of severe illnesses, stud) ing abroad or pur
suing professional sports," Vela said.

"We're a little frustrated that a lot oft his
happened two or three years ago when we
weren't even living in the house," he said.
I lowever, he added that with the privilege
ol "premier" housing on the row comes
responsibilities and obligations that the or
ganization will address.
SAE has hosted several recent ac adem
ic programs and community service
events, including a talk with Vice Provost
lor Undergraduate Education John Brav
man and a blood drive, which took place
yesterday in the fraternity's house.
Kappa Sig also faces similar chal
lenges regarding oc cupanc y and service
oriented activities. In response to its pro
bation, the organization has implement
ed two community service projects in
conjunction with Palo Alto Urban Min
istries and the Bing Nursery School, ac
cording to Kappa Sig vice president
Rahul Dhillon, a senior.
