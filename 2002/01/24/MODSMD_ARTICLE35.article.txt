# Six teams vying for second place
## With the Card pulling away, rest of Pac-10 can only hope for 2nd 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This season, ihe I'ac ili( 10 Con
ference lias been comprised of
Stanford, and ilien everyone else.
I lie No. women's basketball
team (1 <S-]. <N-0 l'ar-1 ()) jusi seems
to be in a league of its own.
I he team holds a scoring mar
gin of 20.2 points in its games this
season, first in the I'ac-10. The sec
ond-leading margin is Arizona
Slate, with 0.7 points per game.
The Cardinal is also first in stor
ing. field goal percentage, defen

sive field goal percentage and
three-point accuracy. Out of the all
the I'ac-10 teams, Stanford owns
the most team rebounds, blocks
and assists.
With five weeks left until the
I'ac-10 (Conference I ournament,
the rest of the conference is
scrambling for position. Barring
any major upsets, the Cardinal
will get the number one seed in
the tournament.
I he second seed, on the other
hand, is up for grabs. Arizona
State, Southern California and
Oregon State are all 0-3 in con
ference play. Washington, Ari
zona and Oregon all currently
stand at 5-4.
In the conference tournament,
the bottom four teams have to plav
an extra game as No. 7 plavs No. 10

and No. .X plays No. 0. Therefore
the seeding can make a huge differ
ence, especially with the parity in
the conference after the top seed.
()l the six teams, the Sun Dev
ils have the best overall record at
15-5. I he team was ranked No.
22 in the preseason polls and is
led by senior guard Amanda Lev
ens, who is second in the I'ac-10
with a 10.2 scoring average. The
Sun Devils are on the verge of re
entering the top-25 but must face
the Cardinal on Saturday. Ari
zona State is the favorite to be a
second representative of the Pac
-10 in the NCAA tournament.
()regon Slate has shown tenac
ity this season, primarily due to
the outstanding pla) of guard Fe
licia Ragland. Kagland is leading
the I'ac-10 by scoring an average

of 20.5 points per game this sea
son. Kagland also has the highest
single-game-point total of any
I'ac-10 player this season, scoring
.'57 against Portland. Kagland was
this week's I'ac-10 player of the
week as the Beavers defeated in
state rival ()regon.
As conference play continues
for another few weeks, the I'ac-10
hierarchy should become clearer.
1 his weekend, USC will face both
Oregon and Oregon State. I low
ever, the parity among these six
teams could eventually hurt each
team's chances at a NCIAA tourna
ment bid.
Despite the confusion, one
thing seems inevitable. When the
dust settles, Stanford will be left
standing to take on the exhausted
victor of the second-tier.
