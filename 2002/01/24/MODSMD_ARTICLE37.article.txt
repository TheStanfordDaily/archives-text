# GUARDS OF THE FUTURE
## BATTLE AT THE POINT 
### AARON LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
First it was lob) Bailey and
Brevin Knight.
Then, Baron Davis and
Arthur Lee.
Finally, Karl Watson and Mike
McDonald.
But (ledric 80/eman and ( litis
I lernandezr
Yes. And gel used to ii.
Both freshman point guards
are here to stay. Bozeman is al
ready starting tor the Bruins and
Hernandez is splitting time at
point tor the Cardinal. 1 herelore,
the potential fora four-year rivaln
between the two begins tonight .it
Pauley Pavilion, where UCLA
hosts Stanford at 1:M) p.m.
"It's vetv unique, Generally,
both of us have had upperclass
men — floor generals it you
will," said Stanford junior guard
Julius Barnes. "You could tell
the experience and maturity
they had out there.
"This year we really don't have
that. Chris is still learning and so
is Cedrit. It'll be valuable minutes
for them because it's a big game
and it'll be .111 experience 1 hat will
help them out in the long run,"
lit- said.
It's definitely a switch from the
norm, from the standpoint of
everyone involved.
From Stanford and UCLA's
point of view, rarely, if ever, do two
freshmen run each otlense — not
to mention at the same time,

against one another.
"In an ideal situation, you
wouldn't rely on freshmen to
be playing significant min
utes," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery.
()n the other hand, from 1 ler
nandez and Bozeman's perspec -
tive, this certainly isn't high
school anymore.
"1 think it's exciting that you
have two point guards this young,"
I lernandezsaid. "It's amazing. It's
kind of weird because last year we
were both in high school and a
\car later we're playing at a big I )i
-vision I school."
In actuality, the rivalry be
tween the two has already been
brewing. For the past two years,
Ilernande/'s Clovis West High
School of Fresno lias laced Boze
man's Santa Ana Mater Dei in the
semifinals of the CIF Division I
(championship.
In 2000. I lernandez team pre
vailed in overtime.
I n 2001, 80/eman's team
got revenge and ultimately
won the title.
So is Hernandez looking for
payback in 2002?
"Maybe," he said with a smile.
"Bui, personally, it's in the 1..A.
area, and Stanford and L CI .A is al
ways a big rivalry anyway. I
wouldn't mind having a better
game than him though."
Bozeman said he agreed.
Sort of.
"I think it's two diflerent teams
and two diflerent games this year.

But il it's a revenge thing, it's a re
venge tiling." said Bozeman, who
is averaging 3.1 assists and is shoot
ing 48.f» percent from the field.
More important, of course, is
which team is on top in the end.
However, this does not take away
from the fact that Bozeman and
Hernandez will play pivotal roles
in the offense and in the ultimate
success or failure of their respec
tive teams.
Bozeman, who played on the
same AAI basketball team as Cal
freshman Jamal Sampson and
Stanford's Josh Childress, has
started the last two games for
UCLA after sitting out a month
with a torn meniscus in his right
knee. Alter successful arthroscopic
surgery, the freshman has re
joined his team and retaken the
reigns of the offense.
"UCLA's stull is not that com
plex. 1 1ic\ run, get out and go. It's
not hard for Bozeman to make the
adjustment," Montgomery said.
"Bin in the point guard position
for us, it is hard to know all the nu
ances of what we're trying to do,"
Montgomery continued. "It's de
pendent on Chris setting people
np. a little less freelance and a little
less athleticism."
I lernandez, therelore, is slowly
gaining more minutes as Mont
gomery watches the young guard
adjust to the intricate Cardinal of
fense. l lie Kith-year head coach
said that he likes that other players
feed off of the energy that Her
nandez brings.

Hie most glaring example ot
Montgomery's eonfideuce in I ler
nandez tame two weeks ago, when
lie went with the freshman in the

final lour minutesol the C animal's
loss to ()regon. All hough he ques
tioned the ( hoice later, it looks as
though Hernandez will still be

handed the ball cometmuch time.
In fact, it looks as though
both will.
For the next four years.

In actuality, the rivalry be
tween the two has already been

In 2000. I lernandez team pre

I n 2001, 80/eman's team

So is Hernandez looking for
payback in 2002?
"Maybe," he said with a smile.
"Bui, personally, it's in the 1..A.
area, and Stanford and L CI .A is al
ways a big rivalry anyway. I
wouldn't mind having a better
game than him though."
Bozeman said he agreed.
Sort of.
"I think it's two diflerent teams
and two diflerent games this year.

But il it's a revenge thing, it's a re
venge tiling." said Bozeman, who
is averaging 3.1 assists and is shoot
ing 48.f» percent from the field.
More important, of course, is
which team is on top in the end.
However, this does not take away
from the fact that Bozeman and
Hernandez will play pivotal roles
in the offense and in the ultimate
success or failure of their respec
tive teams.
Bozeman, who played on the
same AAI basketball team as Cal
freshman Jamal Sampson and
Stanford's Josh Childress, has
started the last two games for
UCLA after sitting out a month
with a torn meniscus in his right
knee. Alter successful arthroscopic
surgery, the freshman has re
joined his team and retaken the
reigns of the offense.
"UCLA's stull is not that com
plex. 1 1ic\ run, get out and go. It's
not hard for Bozeman to make the
adjustment," Montgomery said.
"Bin in the point guard position
for us, it is hard to know all the nu
ances of what we're trying to do,"
Montgomery continued. "It's de
pendent on Chris setting people
np. a little less freelance and a little
less athleticism."
I lernandez, therelore, is slowly
gaining more minutes as Mont

For the next four years.

Yes. And gel used to ii.
Both freshman point guards
are here to stay. Bozeman is al
ready starting tor the Bruins and
Hernandez is splitting time at
point tor the Cardinal. 1 herelore,
the potential fora four-year rivaln
between the two begins tonight .it
Pauley Pavilion, where UCLA
hosts Stanford at 1:M) p.m.
"It's vetv unique, Generally,
both of us have had upperclass
men — floor generals it you
will," said Stanford junior guard
Julius Barnes. "You could tell
the experience and maturity
they had out there.
"This year we really don't have
that. Chris is still learning and so
is Cedrit. It'll be valuable minutes
for them because it's a big game
and it'll be .111 experience 1 hat will
help them out in the long run,"
lit- said.
It's definitely a switch from the
norm, from the standpoint of
everyone involved.
From Stanford and UCLA's
point of view, rarely, if ever, do two
freshmen run each otlense — not
to mention at the same time,

against one another.
"In an ideal situation, you
wouldn't rely on freshmen to
be playing significant min
utes," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery.
()n the other hand, from 1 ler
nandez and Bozeman's perspec -
tive, this certainly isn't high
school anymore.
"1 think it's exciting that you
have two point guards this young,"
I lernandezsaid. "It's amazing. It's

were both in high school and a
