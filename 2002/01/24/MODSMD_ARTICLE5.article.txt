Members of the Alpha Kappa
Alpha sorority and the Gamma
Zeta Alpha fraternity will .kick off
College P.L.A.Y.E.R.S., a program
designed to foster academic and
social advancement, at the East
Palo Alto I ligh School tomorrow.
College P.L.A.Y.E.R.S., Pro
moting Lifelong Achievement of
Youth Empowered to Rise to
Success, has been in development
since Oct. 21 and was conceived
by AKA as a part of its local vol
unteer ellorts.
"We all started out as tutors
and progressively started work
ing with other classes at the
school," said senior I amara Lacy,
AKA's community service chair.
"Over time, we discovered the
need to c reate a program that fo
cused on college preparatory
[services| for the students."
Development ol the program
specifically b\ AKA and GZA,
African-American- and Latino
themed organizations, respec
tively, were especially appropri
ate, according to (lharia Rolland,
director of professional enhance
ment at the School of Education,
who served as the liaison be
tween the- school and the Stan
ford organizations.
"In an effort to reach all stu
dents on the- high school campus

and to give them role models, we
chose to have African-American
and Latino female and male
groups actively and formally in
volved in the school," she said.
East Palo Alto High, a charter
school, exhibits broad student diver
sity, according to I nicy's estimates.
" The school is approximately
50 percent Latino and 50 percent
African American," she said.
Rolland added that while AKA
and GZA will be running the pro
gram, other Stanford groups are
encouraged to volunteer.
East Palo Alto I ligh School was
strategically selec ted to house the
new program because it was"a
charter school, and thereby in
need of a lot of support." Lac) said.
Rolland said the school "is the
first public high school in this ( ity
in almost 25 years. It opened this
September with <S() ninth graders
and will add a grade each year.'
To get the school off to a run
ning start, P.L.A.Y.E.R.S. has devel
oped a mission with multiple goals.
First, it will stress the need lor
its participants to be well-round
ed individuals.
Second, it will challenge stu
dents to strive for immediate ac ad
emic success.
In line with its founding pur
pose, the program will encourage
students to attend college.
Additionally, the program will
provide students with a better
understanding of college life and
it will prepare students for col
lege entrance requirements.
Finally, it will help students ma
ture psychologically for the put
pose of strong social development.

Specific activities that
P.L.A.Y.E.R.S. will sponsor in
clude workshops and support
services tailored to college-bound
high school students.
"Fhe program will provide
PSA I / SA I prcparaton classes,
college fairs, college tours, tutor
ing, extracurricular classes and
community service initiatives,"
Lacy said.
Despite its well-conceived
plan, the program does have
some challenges to overcome,
Rolland admits.
"Developing and sustaining
the campus-wide support ol the
program is one main challenge
and requirement," she said.
Rolland, however, does not seem
to be intimidated by this challenge.

"I am certain that this chal
lenge will be met," she said. " I he
Kast Palo Alto community and its
children [are sources] ol on
going support and interest.
Lacy cited a more logistical
concern with the program.
"I feel that the main problem
with the program will he attaining
funds to support it. I .ac \si id.
"Because Alpha Kappa Alpha
and (lamina Zeta Alpha arc small
sororal and fraternal chapters, we
receive small amounts ol monc\
each year to carry out our pro
gramming endeavors." she said.
lo overcome this hurdle, I-ic v
said she plans to register the pro
gram with the Office ol Student
Activities so that the University
c an help with funding.

designed to foster academic and
social advancement, at the East
Palo Alto I ligh School tomorrow.
College P.L.A.Y.E.R.S., Pro
moting Lifelong Achievement of
Youth Empowered to Rise to
Success, has been in development
since Oct. 21 and was conceived
by AKA as a part of its local vol
unteer ellorts.
"We all started out as tutors
and progressively started work
ing with other classes at the
school," said senior I amara Lacy,
AKA's community service chair.
"Over time, we discovered the
need to c reate a program that fo
cused on college preparatory
[services| for the students."
Development ol the program
specifically b\ AKA and GZA,
African-American- and Latino
themed organizations, respec
tively, were especially appropri
ate, according to (lharia Rolland,
director of professional enhance
ment at the School of Education,
who served as the liaison be
tween the- school and the Stan
ford organizations.
"In an effort to reach all stu
dents on the- high school campus

and to give them role models, we
chose to have African-American
and Latino female and male
groups actively and formally in
volved in the school," she said.
East Palo Alto High, a charter
school, exhibits broad student diver
sity, according to I nicy's estimates.
" The school is approximately
50 percent Latino and 50 percent
African American," she said.
Rolland added that while AKA
and GZA will be running the pro
gram, other Stanford groups are
encouraged to volunteer.
East Palo Alto I ligh School was
strategically selec ted to house the
new program because it was"a
charter school, and thereby in
need of a lot of support." Lac) said.
Rolland said the school "is the
first public high school in this ( ity
in almost 25 years. It opened this
September with <S() ninth graders
and will add a grade each year.'
To get the school off to a run
ning start, P.L.A.Y.E.R.S. has devel
oped a mission with multiple goals.
First, it will stress the need lor
its participants to be well-round
ed individuals.
Second, it will challenge stu
dents to strive for immediate ac ad
emic success.
In line with its founding pur
pose, the program will encourage
students to attend college.
Additionally, the program will
provide students with a better
understanding of college life and
it will prepare students for col
lege entrance requirements.
Finally, it will help students ma
ture psychologically for the put
pose of strong social development.

Specific activities that
P.L.A.Y.E.R.S. will sponsor in
clude workshops and support
services tailored to college-bound
high school students.
"Fhe program will provide
PSA I / SA I prcparaton classes,
college fairs, college tours, tutor
ing, extracurricular classes and
community service initiatives,"
Lacy said.
Despite its well-conceived
plan, the program does have
some challenges to overcome,
Rolland admits.
"Developing and sustaining
the campus-wide support ol the
program is one main challenge
and requirement," she said.
Rolland, however, does not seem
to be intimidated by this challenge.

"I am certain that this chal
lenge will be met," she said. " I he
Kast Palo Alto community and its
children [are sources] ol on
going support and interest.
Lacy cited a more logistical
concern with the program.
"I feel that the main problem
with the program will he attaining
funds to support it. I .ac \si id.
"Because Alpha Kappa Alpha
and (lamina Zeta Alpha arc small
sororal and fraternal chapters, we
receive small amounts ol monc\
each year to carry out our pro
gramming endeavors." she said.
lo overcome this hurdle, I-ic v
said she plans to register the pro
gram with the Office ol Student
Activities so that the University
c an help with funding.
