### JENNIFER NUCKOLS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he events of Sept. I 1
changed ihe atmosphere of col
lege campuses around the nation.
Now, some Stanford students are
trying to better understand the
events and implications ol that
fateful day with a newstudent-ini
tiated course tliis quarter.
About 70 students are en
rolled in "Understanding 9-11,
Its Causes, Context and Conse
quences," a course coordinated
In senior Liz Aab.
"There was a need that need
ed to be filled," Aab said. 'Tins. 1
wanted to take a ( lass like this."
But "Understanding" isn't
the only student-initiated course
ollered this quarter. There are
four others: "Mental Illness and
the Veteran Population," "Intro
duction to ()bjectivism: I he Phi
losophy of Ayn Rand," "Behind
the Blat k Mask: I he Philosophy,
History and Practice of Anar
chism" and "Wounds in the
Sand: The Arizona-Sonora 80l -
der Region."
The idea for the Sept. 1 1
( lass came to Aab when she was
at a campus war rally and no
ticed that there were a lot of
questions raised that no one
was able to answer.
"I thought people had
stopped paying attention and
had stopped (aring," Aab said,

"but I have since seen that
there is both an emotional and
a personal investment [in.the
events of Sept. I 1 ]. The inter
est is universal."
.According to Aab, 130 people
attended the first class and about
70 have enrolled for one or two
units of c redit. Thee lass receives
administrative and financial
support from the International
Relations department and is run
by a group of nine students.
Junior Jessica Jenkins is au
diting the ( lass. "It's an impor
tant ( lass to have and is a good
forum for dialogue," she said.
"It's clearly meeting a need."
The ( lass consists of weekly
guest speakers and small disc us
sion sections. Speakers include:
Political ScieiN e Prof. ('.oil Black
er, special assistant to the presi
dent for national security affairs
during the Clinton administra
tion; Management Science & En
gineering Prof. William Perry,
secretary of defense from 1994
to 1997; and Michael KUiot, edi
tor-at-large ol lime magazine.
I"he "()bjectivism" (lass is led
In junior Jason Rheins, who also
came up with the idea.
"I want to become a professor
of philosophy," Rheins said. "I
wanted to experience teaching.
Rheins said he discovered ob
jectivism around the time he en
tered Stanford as a freshman and
has been president of the Stanford
Objectivists club since the begin
ning of his sophomore year.
"Objectivism is all about reason
and happiness and freedom,"
said Rheins.
I he ( lass meets weekly and al
ternates between lectures from
guests, who are mainly from the
Ayn Rand institute, and a discus
sion section led In Rheins.
According to Rheins, about 10
students have enrolled for credit in
addition to a number of auditors.
1 he class is not sponsored by
the philosophy department be
cause, he explained, "all modern
philosophy and objectivism are
diametrically opposed." Me
found a sponsor in a fellow Rand
fan in the economics department.
"Illness" is taught by senior
I lelene Mik. Mik is director of an
organization that brings together
Stanford students with patients in
a local veteran's psychiatry ward.
"I wanted to create a course
which would give our volun
teers an enriched experience,"
she said.
About a do/en students are en

rolled in the class and there are a
variety of guest lecturers, includ
ing professors from the medical
school as well as individuals who
have personal family experience

with mental disorders.
According to Mik, the student
response has been very positive.
"Not onl\ does this class give stu
dents the opportunity to get the

clinical experience that many med
ical schools require," Mik said, "but
I think it gives them the opportuni
ty to figure out whether medicine is
really for them."

tiated course tliis quarter.
About 70 students are en
rolled in "Understanding 9-11,
Its Causes, Context and Conse
quences," a course coordinated
In senior Liz Aab.
"There was a need that need
ed to be filled," Aab said. 'Tins. 1
wanted to take a ( lass like this."
But "Understanding" isn't
the only student-initiated course
ollered this quarter. There are
four others: "Mental Illness and
the Veteran Population," "Intro
duction to ()bjectivism: I he Phi
losophy of Ayn Rand," "Behind
the Blat k Mask: I he Philosophy,
History and Practice of Anar
chism" and "Wounds in the
Sand: The Arizona-Sonora 80l -
der Region."
The idea for the Sept. 1 1
( lass came to Aab when she was
at a campus war rally and no
ticed that there were a lot of
questions raised that no one
was able to answer.
"I thought people had
stopped paying attention and
had stopped (aring," Aab said,

"but I have since seen that
there is both an emotional and
a personal investment [in.the
events of Sept. I 1 ]. The inter
est is universal."
.According to Aab, 130 people
attended the first class and about
70 have enrolled for one or two
units of c redit. Thee lass receives
administrative and financial
support from the International
Relations department and is run
by a group of nine students.
Junior Jessica Jenkins is au
diting the ( lass. "It's an impor
tant ( lass to have and is a good
forum for dialogue," she said.
"It's clearly meeting a need."
The ( lass consists of weekly
guest speakers and small disc us
sion sections. Speakers include:
Political ScieiN e Prof. ('.oil Black
er, special assistant to the presi
dent for national security affairs
during the Clinton administra
tion; Management Science & En
gineering Prof. William Perry,
secretary of defense from 1994
to 1997; and Michael KUiot, edi
tor-at-large ol lime magazine.
I"he "()bjectivism" (lass is led
In junior Jason Rheins, who also
came up with the idea.
"I want to become a professor
of philosophy," Rheins said. "I
wanted to experience teaching.
Rheins said he discovered ob
jectivism around the time he en
tered Stanford as a freshman and
has been president of the Stanford
Objectivists club since the begin
ning of his sophomore year.
"Objectivism is all about reason
and happiness and freedom,"
said Rheins.
I he ( lass meets weekly and al
ternates between lectures from
guests, who are mainly from the
Ayn Rand institute, and a discus
sion section led In Rheins.
According to Rheins, about 10
students have enrolled for credit in
addition to a number of auditors.
1 he class is not sponsored by
the philosophy department be
cause, he explained, "all modern
philosophy and objectivism are
diametrically opposed." Me
found a sponsor in a fellow Rand
fan in the economics department.
"Illness" is taught by senior
I lelene Mik. Mik is director of an
organization that brings together
Stanford students with patients in
a local veteran's psychiatry ward.
"I wanted to create a course
which would give our volun
teers an enriched experience,"
she said.
About a do/en students are en

rolled in the class and there are a
variety of guest lecturers, includ
ing professors from the medical
school as well as individuals who
have personal family experience

with mental disorders.
According to Mik, the student
response has been very positive.
"Not onl\ does this class give stu
dents the opportunity to get the

clinical experience that many med
ical schools require," Mik said, "but
I think it gives them the opportuni
ty to figure out whether medicine is
really for them."
