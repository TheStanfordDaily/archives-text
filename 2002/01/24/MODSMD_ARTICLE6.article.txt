### JENNIFER NUCKOLS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he events of Sept. I 1
changed ihe atmosphere of col
lege campuses around the nation.
Now, some Stanford students are
trying to better understand the
events and implications ol that
fateful day with a newstudent-ini
tiated course tliis quarter.
About 70 students are en
rolled in "Understanding 9-11,
Its Causes, Context and Conse
quences," a course coordinated
In senior Liz Aab.
"There was a need that need
ed to be filled," Aab said. 'Tins. 1
wanted to take a ( lass like this."
But "Understanding" isn't
the only student-initiated course
ollered this quarter. There are
four others: "Mental Illness and
the Veteran Population," "Intro
duction to ()bjectivism: I he Phi
losophy of Ayn Rand," "Behind
the Blat k Mask: I he Philosophy,
History and Practice of Anar
chism" and "Wounds in the
Sand: The Arizona-Sonora 80l -
der Region."
The idea for the Sept. 1 1
( lass came to Aab when she was
at a campus war rally and no
ticed that there were a lot of
questions raised that no one
was able to answer.
"I thought people had
stopped paying attention and
had stopped (aring," Aab said,

"but I have since seen that
there is both an emotional and
a personal investment [in.the
events of Sept. I 1 ]. The inter
est is universal."
.According to Aab, 130 people
attended the first class and about
70 have enrolled for one or two
units of c redit. Thee lass receives
administrative and financial
support from the International
Relations department and is run
by a group of nine students.
Junior Jessica Jenkins is au
diting the ( lass. "It's an impor
tant ( lass to have and is a good
forum for dialogue," she said.
"It's clearly meeting a need."
The ( lass consists of weekly
guest speakers and small disc us
sion sections. Speakers include:
Political ScieiN e Prof. ('.oil Black
er, special assistant to the presi
dent for national security affairs
during the Clinton administra
tion; Management Science & En
gineering Prof. William Perry,
secretary of defense from 1994
to 1997; and Michael KUiot, edi

came up with the idea.
"I want to become a professor
of philosophy," Rheins said. "I
