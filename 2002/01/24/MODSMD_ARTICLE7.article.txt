## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSr l ndcrgraduate Senate
voted Tuesday night to allow Terri
Mos(|iieda, co-chair of I he Advocacy
Committee, to remain a senator but de
nied her voting rights lor the quarter she
will he abroad.
Mosqueda (hose to study abroad in
Oxford tlm quarter, though she had not
planned to do so when she was elected.
I ler decision sparked .1 debate at both this
and last week's meetings over whether
senators should be allowed to go abroad

and whether Mosqueda, a junior, could
remain a senator.
Further discussion over the matter
ensued after Henry Towsner, Nomina
tions Committee chair, and Charlene
Ng, Administration and Rules Commit
tee chair, observed that Mosqueda
could. H allowed to keep bet Senate scat,
vote from ()xford if she was able to hear
and panicipate in meetings via speaker
phone or a similar device.
"You can't cast a vote unless you're
part) to the discussion," I owsner, a ju-
nior, explained. "II she hears it,
that's not an issue, but she* has to In
able to hear it."
This point contradicted prior
arguments that Mosqueda's voting
rights would be automatically for
feited by her absence.
" That's not really stipulated in
the by-laws or the Constitution or
anything," revealed Ng, a senior.
Questions arose surrounding
the logistics of Mosqueda listfil
ing to meetings and voting while
overseas.
"I have trouble believing that
she could hear through a < ell
phone what everyone is saying and
say things that everyone could
hear," Towsner said.
Senate Associate Dan VVend
landt noted that a woman in his
summer job communicated at
meetings via speakeiphone.
"According to everyone in the
facility, she was very active and very
involved," said Wendlandt, a fresh
man. "I think [Terri] would be able
to be an active participant."
ASSU President Matt Brewer, a
junior, questioned the feasibility of
a "speakeiphone senator," calling
such a thing a "logistical night
mare." Brewer said he also object
ed to the idea on a philosophical
level—"accommodating so much
to someone leaving."

(.raves questioned the idea of the
Senate'removing an elected official
and thereby depriving voters of the
representation they wanted.
"I think Terri has deprived stu
dents of representation," Towsner
countered.
Ximena Martinez, co-chair of
the Advocacy Commit tee, offered a
different perspective. "Beingasen
ator isn't only just being at Senate
meetings," Martinez, a junior, said.
" I here's a lot of behind [the
scenes] work ... I don't feel she de
prives students of that representa
tion, because she's willing to work."
No one voted to remove
Mosqueda from the Senate. The
next motion to allow her a leave of
absence without voting rights
passed 10-2-1.
Martinez c ast one of the two dis
senting votes, feeling the decision
was being made too quickly to ex
amine the possibility of Mosqueda
voting electronically.
"Although this is not an ideal sit
uation in my perspective," she said,
"it is nevertheless an option that I
feel should have been and still
should be considered more 112 ully."
I lie Senate decided to examine
the issue- of senators going abroad
at a special meeting today.
"At this point," Mosqueda said,
"the Senate realizes that by discour
aging senators to go abroad it risks
losing a substantial amount of candi
dates and is outlining a policy such
that these candidates are fully aware
of their options before running and
before applying to go abroad."
