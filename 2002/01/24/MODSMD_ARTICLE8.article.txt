In an effort to reinvigorate the study
of social sciences in the former Soviet
Union, Stanford's Initiative on Distance
Learning lias begun to offer political sci
ence courses to universities in Russia. A
team of professors taught the first
course in the program. Political Science

ing World," last quarter.
"T he su< cess of the program thus far
exceeds our initial expectations, said
Alexei Sitnikov, a doctoral student in
political science who coordinates tin-
Initiative on Distance Learning from
the Stanford in Moscow office. The
universities, including administrators,
faculty and students, are responding
very well to the program.

I he program currently offers two
classes at four universities in Russia.
I here are 1"> to 17 students enrolled in
each (lass from each university. I he

savs that the program is a "unique op

pert knowledge from world-famous
American scholars from Stanford
I 'niversity."
Smirnova praised sessions as
opportunities to network with other stu
dents and to discuss the application of
academic concepts to reality.
"This is very important, especially
now when the problems of world securi
ty come to the foreground, not only of
tiie ac ademic discourse," she said.

Yuliva Yamineva sine! Mikhail
Bcsedin, instructors at Southern
Ural State University in
Chelyabinsk, said the courses have
stimulated their students' inter
ests in political science and inter
national politics. I hey called the
program "a valuable contribution

to the efforts of breaking negative
tendencies of Russian youth's
alienation from politics."
rhese courses are part of a
one-year pilot program funded
by grants to Stanford's Institute
for International Studies. I lie
Russian students are not c barged
tuition, but ibis might change de
pending on the program's future
direction and needs.
Although the two pilot courses

are only from the political science
department, there are plans to
expand to other disciplines and
to other universities throughout
Russia. Ac cording to Kate kuluis,
the managing director for the ini
tiative, Stanford will expand the
program to 10 universities and
four courses by the 20(W-04 acad
emic year.
Political Science Prof. Michael
Mc Kaul, who was part of the

teaching team last quarter, said he
feels that leaching in this program
has been a valuable experience:
"[The Russian students] help to
challenge my assumptions about
Russia that do not usually get
challenged in the American c lass
room ... I am struck by their ea
gerness to debate, something one
did not find a decade ago when 1
was a visiting lecturer at Moscow
State I niversitv."
