Stanford graduates who took part in
the historic 1968 "Taking of the Mic"
returned to campus this Wednesday
as part of the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Week 2002, spearheaded hv the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Celebration Committee.
By reminding us of Stanford's historical
struggles and advances as well as shedding
light upon the context of current social jus
tice campaigns to improve our University,
the "Stanford: 1968 Revisited" event served
as a fitting tribute to these courageous per
sons who were instrumental to strengthen
ing the Stanford community.
The Taking of the Mic occurred in April of
1968, shortly after the assassination of Dr.
King. The University administration had or
ganized a forum to address questions of
racism at Stanford; 70 members of the Black

Student Union marched to the auditorium,
walked on-stage, took the microphone from
then-Provost Richard Lyman and presented
10 demands to the University.
Among these demands, which were re
ceived with a standing ovation, were the cre
ation of the African and African American
Studies program, increased minority enroll
ment and the hiring of a greater number of
minority professors.
Delores Mack, one of the BSU members
involved in the 1968 event, eloquently ex
plained the importance of taking risks for
important causes; without risks, there can be
no progress. These words rang true for
much of the audience, which was largely
composed of students of color, whose pres
ence here at Stanford represents in part the
fruit of the 1968 BSU's effective action.

Before 1969, there were typically two or
three black students who formed part of the
entering undergraduate class; one year after
the laking of the Mic, black students en
tered Stanford. Today Stanford stands as one
ol the most diverse prestigious universities.
Intelligent and prepared students of color
have always existed; decisive action on the
part of students to concretely address facets
of racism at our University contributed to
their increasing presence on this campus.
Yet as three black student leaders ex
pressed in a spoken word tribute last night,
the University still needs to make significant
gains in minority recruitment, admission
and retention, among other things. As James
Gibbs, professor emeritus of anthropology,
indicated in his response to a student's ques
tion, risks could also be taken to diversify the

faculty's demographic composition.
Radical and broad-based action in the past
led to changes that we now all benefit from as
members of the Stanford community. Vi
sions to improve our community in crucial
ways continue; as part of this community we
must lead the way to make these visions a re
ality. Our University is a place of great op
portunity, and improvements toward more
equality and social justice can only make
Stanford stronger.
The experiences of the Stanford gradu
ates demonstrate our ability as students to ef
fect important social change. As current
leaders ofour University, and in the future as
leaders outside of Stanford, we cannot fall
back upon the gains made by others for us:
each of us must act to make the change we
envision.
