# TWO GUYS WHO ARE BETTER THAN YOU
## Failing to Reinvent Yourself 
### 
Human behav
ior is charac
terized by a cu
rious, hereto
fore-unexplained para
dox: we both resist and in
vite change. "But Doug
and Ramit," you might
say, "aren't you really just
using'heretofore' to sound

intelligent in your 112 irst sentence to lure read
ers into reading?"
One could perhaps inculpate our em
broilment in the aforementioned enterprise,
although we would undoubtedly disac
knowledge this as veracious.
In any case, the principle remains: as you
move through various stages of your life —
childhood, college, etc. — you try to reinvent
yourself to erase the horrible mistakes of
your past.
Doug and Ramit, what the hell are you
talking about?
Let's talk about the high s< hool / college
transition. (chances are very, very good that
you were a dork in high school. And when
coming to college, either you tried to rein
vent yourself and failed, or you didn't even
try to do that, in which case you are unim
portant and probably holed up in Sweet I lall
trying to hack the Ciibson, or my Web site at
http://www.stanford.edu/~-nimit.
As for those of you who tried to change
once you got to college, did you really?
Did you get in touch with your inner self?
When you think about us, do you touch
yourself? Oooh ooh, oh, you don't want
anybody else, when you think about us,
do you touch yourself?
Seriously, though, in high school you
looked at all the junior high girls at least once
or twice. Now that you're in college, you
don't want to seem like a pedophile. I nfor
tunately, you may not have been able to
change your ways betause either (a) you are
a pedophile: or (b) the 7th-grade Syndrome
has foiled your plans.
1 his syndrome is one of the most baffling
concepts of male-female relations. But be
fore we explain, a true story: when Ramit
was in Davis this summer (a filthy, filthy town
that reeks of cows), he was driving around
one night with some friends. I hey all decid
ed to go loan AM / I'M gas station to get some
food "and saw some pretty hot girls when
they walked in the door. Ihe girls' backs
were fa< ed towards them. I low can the 7th
grade Syndrome Ik- applied here?
It works like this: you will see a girl from
far away and note her general build, hair
and clothes, coming to the conclusion that
she's probably hot. Since obviously you're
not going to talk toiler, you try to maneuver
so at least you can look ;it her face and stuff.
Alas, this is when the essential sadness of the
7th-grade Syndrome arises. When you man
age to look at her face, or she turns around,
you realize that the distant view of her was a
trick! She can t even drive. Telltale signs are
t(x> miK h Fisher-Prke makeup, bat rettes,or
in the worst c ase, braces.
Thus, gentlemen, you will henceforth

forever be wondering
about any girl you find at
tractive from a distance.
Sorry.
Another thing that oc
curred to us about the
high s< hool/collegetransi
tion was student govern
ment. Let's not pretend,
other than being are-

sume-builder, student government in high
school was completely worthless. In high
school, Doug was president of the student
body. He did nothing. Well, he somehow
managed to spend over half his budget with
out raising a single penny of revenue, there
by leaving the next president with no hope at
all. But his government didn't actually do
anything.
College government is no different. At
least in college they admit it while they still
have their position, just like our very own
ASSU President Matt Brewer. In a recent
Daily article, he cheerily stated, "Last year,
we did nothing. We don't have any credibil
ity right now, so there's nothing to lose."
Kudos to you, sir, for not distorting the truth
of your position's uselessness.
Finally, there is one universal truth that
every entering c ollege student hears: "you
won't be the best anymore." At most
schools, students are intelligent enough to
realize their relative ineptitude and simply
enter school defeated (think Chico State).
But not at Stanford. No, students here ide
alistically believe they can still be the best,
just like they were iti their Oklahoma
prairie school. I'he result? 140-pound
guys walking onto the basketball team to
the tune of utter failure. A simple rule of
thumb: if you're not a 300-pound man
who either has or could kick our asses, you
will not be on an athletic team here.
In terms of academics, you'll always find
one freshman in one of your classes who in
sists on taking 22 units with CS, LK and phi
lc >s< >phy just Ic >r gc x k I measure. C ire nv up and
learn your place, please. We at Stanford
have cultivated a careful regimen of low
level academics, moderate binge-drinking
and high levels of physical unattrac tiveness.
Join us.
Also join us in washing our hands after
you use the rest room, gcxldamnit. Sony to
prolong our rants, but this is getting ridicu
lous. I ake, as a not-at-all completely hypo
thetical example, the second-floor men's
bathroom on the eating-club side of l oyon.
We honestly believe that 80 percent of the
(x-ople w ho use those toilets don't wash their
hands. Jesus Christ, how hard is that to do
after you just sj>ent 20 minutes in there? Ihe
only guy w ho is excused is the one who uri
nates with his hands on his waist, standing as
if he were about to embark on some monu
mental conquest. And don't think we can't
tell who it is, either. We're watching you in
there. At least Doug is.
