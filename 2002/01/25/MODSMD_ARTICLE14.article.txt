Classmates respond to 'Gaudet Doctrine'
In response to (lie Jan. column In
Rob Gaudet ("The Gaudet Doctrine"),
which audaciously declares that law stu
dents are morally bankrupt, 1,1111 deeply of
fended. Asa law student speaking on beliall
of many of my peers, I feel that it is sad and
unfortunate that Mr. Gaudet has never ex
perienced a single worthwhile encounter
with any of his fellow students. He claims
that we are all too obsessed without books
and our grades to engage in basic human
etiquette or community service or the de
bate of ideas that forms the foundation for
the learning process. I cannot sit icily In
while the character of my fellow law stu
dents and myself at e unfairly defamed.
I lie truth is that in any academic envi
ronment, there are some lolks who take
themselves so seriously that they compro
mise their other commitments. I lowever, I
cannot emphasize enough that this is the
exception rather than the norm. Most Stan
ford Law Students are pleasant, sociable
people with interesting and diverse back
grounds.
Mr. Gaudet says thai law students could
not care less about their fellow students or
about community sen ice, but I insist that
nothing could be further from the truth.
Many of us are dedicated to serving the
greater community, by volunteering to
provide legal services for indigent families,
working for children's rights in education
advocacy clinics, fighting for minorities in
immigration programs and donating por
tions of our summer paychec ks to non
profit organizations, just to name a few.
Several of us will go on to c areers as public
defenders, district attorneys, judges and
lawyers for non-profit groups representing
all kinds of worthy causes.
Admittedly, some cynicism exists in the
halls of the law sc 11001. Some students have
given up on their dreams of harnessing the
force of the law to make the world better

.md have resigned to work fora large law
firm and make lots of money. (Some stu
dents are forced to go to large corporate
law lit ins, because they cannot otherwise af
ford to pay back their student loans.) I am
convinced that most of our students still be
lieve in the law asa positive,albeit imperfect
institution that protects the rights we enjoy
in this country and that allows us to pursue
justice.
II Mr. (iaudet has never had more than
a shallow, five-minute conversation with
any of bis fellow law students. I feel sorry for
him. I lis experience is unfortunate, but it
does not represent the view of most law stu
dents. Some students may have smoked
marijuana. One extremist may have writ
ten a book about his dcbauc herons exploits.
But so what? Does that mean that none of
us are decent people who develop genuine
friendships and who volunteer extensively
for good causes?
Additionally, Mr. (iaudet's offensive im
plication that female law students shopping
for vibrators are somehow immoral smacks
of sexism and misogyny and is a slap in the
face ol cgaliiarianism. Indeed, Mr.
(iaudet seems to contradict himself by first
claiming that law students are anti-social,
selfish bookworms, then in the same breath
he c alls us overly social Sodomites.
II undergraduate readers are considering
applying to law school, I urge you not to let
Mr. Gaudet s words impact you negatively.
Personally, my experience lias been chal
lenging. rewarding and lots of fun. Mr.
(iaudet should not displace his anger at the
s<mal void he suffers 111 law school by self
righlcously asserting sweeping, inaccurate
and inconsistent declarations.
If Mr. (iaudet is so convinced that law
school is a place of jaded attitudes and
skewed values, might I suggest that he is
part of the problem rather than a faultless
observer hovering upon a moral cloud.
After all, in his Oct. 24 column (" Hie
(lull of the (Â»I'A"), he recounts that one law

firm wrote to him: "In our view, you have
misrepresented your grade point average
in your e-mail and on your resume and, ac
cordingly, we can no longer consider your
application for employment."

I/iv School, Clms of 2003

In Rob Gaudet's bitter, misanthropic
tirade of Jan. 23 (" I heGaudet I )<k trine"), he
quotesJamie Marquart., co-author of" Brush
\\ ith the Law," as saying: "Dumb people go
to Harvard law School ... I mean dumb.
Dense. Dinks. Rob's "think piece" is simply
evidence that such stupidity sadly extends be
yond (he geographic bounds of Cambridge,
Mass.
Having conceded the fad that he has
never had a real conversation with a law stu
dent and has been largely ignored by the
general student populace during his time at
Stanford I .aw, he then proceeds to generalize
his (admittedly) limited experience with a few
individuals to the entire I-iw School student
Ixxly.
I lis article drips with ignorance, blatant
stereotypes and pure sexism ina way that can
only force a rational reader to ask lx>th:
Where is the editor to check such excesses?"
and I las there been a more blatant waste of
ink since 'Nside 'Nsync: The (Mficial Album?"
Students can only shake their heads in won
derment about Ihe Stanford Daily's operat
ing methcxls when such an individual is able
to lecture law students on their morality after
previously writing such drivel as "On their
own, Muslims have virtually no inherent dig

light and having admitted to sending an er
