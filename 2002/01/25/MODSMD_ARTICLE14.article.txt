Classmates respond to 'Gaudet Doctrine'
In response to (lie Jan. column In
Rob Gaudet ("The Gaudet Doctrine"),
which audaciously declares that law stu
dents are morally bankrupt, 1,1111 deeply of
fended. Asa law student speaking on beliall
of many of my peers, I feel that it is sad and
unfortunate that Mr. Gaudet has never ex
perienced a single worthwhile encounter
with any of his fellow students. He claims
that we are all too obsessed without books
and our grades to engage in basic human
etiquette or community service or the de
bate of ideas that forms the foundation for
the learning process. I cannot sit icily In
while the character of my fellow law stu
dents and myself at e unfairly defamed.
I lie truth is that in any academic envi
ronment, there are some lolks who take
themselves so seriously that they compro
mise their other commitments. I lowever, I
cannot emphasize enough that this is the
exception rather than the norm. Most Stan
ford Law Students are pleasant, sociable
people with interesting and diverse back
grounds.
Mr. Gaudet says thai law students could
not care less about their fellow students or
about community sen ice, but I insist that
nothing could be further from the truth.
Many of us are dedicated to serving the
greater community, by volunteering to
provide legal services for indigent families,
working for children's rights in education
advocacy clinics, fighting for minorities in
immigration programs and donating por
tions of our summer paychec ks to non
profit organizations, just to name a few.
Several of us will go on to c areers as public
defenders, district attorneys, judges and
lawyers for non-profit groups representing
all kinds of worthy causes.
Admittedly, some cynicism exists in the
halls of the law sc 11001. Some students have
given up on their dreams of harnessing the
force of the law to make the world better

.md have resigned to work fora large law
firm and make lots of money. (Some stu
dents are forced to go to large corporate
law lit ins, because they cannot otherwise af
ford to pay back their student loans.) I am
convinced that most of our students still be
lieve in the law asa positive,albeit imperfect
institution that protects the rights we enjoy
in this country and that allows us to pursue
justice.
II Mr. (iaudet has never had more than
a shallow, five-minute conversation with
any of bis fellow law students. I feel sorry for
him. I lis experience is unfortunate, but it
does not represent the view of most law stu
dents. Some students may have smoked
marijuana. One extremist may have writ
ten a book about his dcbauc herons exploits.
But so what? Does that mean that none of
us are decent people who develop genuine
friendships and who volunteer extensively
for good causes?
Additionally, Mr. (iaudet's offensive im
plication that female law students shopping
for vibrators are somehow immoral smacks
of sexism and misogyny and is a slap in the
face ol cgaliiarianism. Indeed, Mr.
(iaudet seems to contradict himself by first
claiming that law students are anti-social,
selfish bookworms, then in the same breath
he c alls us overly social Sodomites.
II undergraduate readers are considering
applying to law school, I urge you not to let
Mr. Gaudet s words impact you negatively.
Personally, my experience lias been chal
lenging. rewarding and lots of fun. Mr.
(iaudet should not displace his anger at the
s<mal void he suffers 111 law school by self
righlcously asserting sweeping, inaccurate
and inconsistent declarations.
If Mr. (iaudet is so convinced that law
school is a place of jaded attitudes and
skewed values, might I suggest that he is
part of the problem rather than a faultless
observer hovering upon a moral cloud.
After all, in his Oct. 24 column (" Hie
(lull of the (»I'A"), he recounts that one law

firm wrote to him: "In our view, you have
misrepresented your grade point average
in your e-mail and on your resume and, ac
cordingly, we can no longer consider your
application for employment."

In Rob Gaudet's bitter, misanthropic
tirade of Jan. 23 (" I heGaudet I )<k trine"), he
quotesJamie Marquart., co-author of" Brush
\\ ith the Law," as saying: "Dumb people go
to Harvard law School ... I mean dumb.
Dense. Dinks. Rob's "think piece" is simply
evidence that such stupidity sadly extends be
yond (he geographic bounds of Cambridge,
Mass.
Having conceded the fad that he has
never had a real conversation with a law stu
dent and has been largely ignored by the
general student populace during his time at
Stanford I .aw, he then proceeds to generalize
his (admittedly) limited experience with a few
individuals to the entire I-iw School student
Ixxly.
I lis article drips with ignorance, blatant
stereotypes and pure sexism ina way that can
only force a rational reader to ask lx>th:
Where is the editor to check such excesses?"
and I las there been a more blatant waste of
ink since 'Nside 'Nsync: The (Mficial Album?"
Students can only shake their heads in won
derment about Ihe Stanford Daily's operat
ing methcxls when such an individual is able
to lecture law students on their morality after
previously writing such drivel as "On their
own, Muslims have virtually no inherent dig
nity aside from a very dim and cold inner
light and having admitted to sending an er
roneous G.P.A. to firms during the inter
viewing process (Stanford Daily, ()ct. 24).
While free and informed debate is cer
tainly (lie hallmark of any good college
newspaper, an editor certainly ought to
step in once that debate becomes unin
formed and vindictive. Mr. (iaudet's piece,
in addition to harping on a topic that is cer
tain to bore the entire undergraduate pop
ulation (a cardinal sin of a good writer) and
only enrage his fellow law students, lacked
the depth, humor or understanding of an
article worthy of publication. Editor, heal
thyself.
DAVID ARM II .1.1.1
l/iw School, Class (j 2001
I don't know Rob Gaudet well; in fact,
the only contact 1 have ever had with him in
my two and a half years of law school was
last weekend, when he performed as a de
fense attorney during a mock tort trial at

which 1 served as a juror. (As a favor, I
might add, to a classmate and friend). I
voted against (iaudet'sclient. Primarily be
cause during his direct examination,
(iaudet had this bad habit of calling the vic
tim of a fictional train wreck a "thing" in
stead of a "person."
Anyhow, after reading (iaudet's "col
umn" I feel really bad for him! Not because
that fellow student refused to share her class
notes with him (the horror!), but rather, be
cause I suspect he is a misanthrope, and as
such, has clearly missed out on knowing
some truly line people at the law school.
Just off the top of my head, I can think of
numerous people working modestly and
without thanks, pay, high grades or any
other son of glory-volunteering as transla
tors and ac lvisc >rs at 11 le " fast I 'ale > Altc > ( im
munity Liw Project." Another large contin
gent of law students runs a program where
they donate their own time to give legal ad
vice t< > incarcerated juvenile delinquents. I n
addition, a significant number of students
volunteer hard lime as fundraisers for the
Stanford Public Interest Legal Fund.
Beyond legal aid, I know of sincere and

humane law students who gi\e their time as
companions to Alzheimer patients iu Palo
Alto, who work tirelessly (and subject them
selves to frequent public disapproval) as po
litical activists. Not to mention .ill the law
students who donate their time to organiza
tions which simply improve the moral < li
mate, social atmosphere and overall quality
of life for the law students themselves.
1 he horrible, sell-absorbed personalities
indicted in (iaudet's column exist, to be cer
tain. Boorish, self-righteous, undisciplined
people exist everywhere, not merely in
these esteemed institutions of higher learn
ing. Sinners exist everywhere. But nothing
in (iaudet's column suggests that he is in
any way different or better than the types
he so bitterly described.
I'm fortunate to have met excellent, ad
mirable people, most definitely friends,
here at Stanford Law. I don't think I'm in
I he minority. Sure, it takes time to get to
know people. Yes, it will be difficult to stay
in touch after graduating. But so what? A
few classmates have given me the brush off,
so as to spend more time hitting the books
or maybe the bars, but I'm sure they had

their reasons.
The trick is never to take it personally,
and try to give others the benefit of the
doubt. In friendship, as in all things, you
only get hack what you're willing to give.

///!/' School, (Miss of 2<M)2
Asa member of the Stanford I .aw School
community and a classmate of Rob Gaudet,
112 am deeply offended and, quite frankly,
angry at his narrow-minded, misogynistic
ruminations.
To speak for tlie liberated female leg;d
mindsofthe2lst century, 1 would like to first
say that moral (ensure for the useol mastur
batory devices went out with corsets and lau
danum. (iaudet's bald denouncement of my
female classmates for "shopping for goodies
to use upon themselves" may reflect more on
his insecurity with his own sexuality than the
moral character of the women of which he
speaks.
Perhaps ii I spent all of my time insulting
Muslims ((Xi. 17th, Benevolent Distortion)

and my classmates, I would Ik: shunned as
well. I am not, however, going to experiment
with this theory. For Ciaudet to lament the
lack ofcivilit\ among Stanford students
is almost laughable since I witnessed him in
sulting the intelligence ofa lellow law student
dining a class exercise not two weeks ago. He
was tiie onl) student 1 witnessed 01 heard ol
being reprimanded lor incivility during the
entire course. Perhaps (iaudet should take a
gander at Kmily I V »t before his next s<h ial in
teraction; she may have some useful insights.
I here are students at the I .aw School who
have more reason to l>e upset than — stu
dents who have taken on enormous person
al debt and who are dedicating tJieii lives to
criminal defense, protecting the First
Amendment and saving the environment.
1 hey do not, however, toot their own horns
and write of their achievements.
It is lamentable that (iaudet is the voice of
the litw School thai the Stanford Daily has
chosen to sponsor. I cannot think of a less
worthy candidate.
