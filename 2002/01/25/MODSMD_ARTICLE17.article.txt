Hoping to quickly establish its
dominance of the Pacific 10 Con
ference, the No. 1 men's swim
ming team (4-0,0-0 Pac-10) kicks
off its first conference dual meets
of the season against No. 9 Arizona
(3-1, 1-0) and No. 5 Arizona State
(5-0, 1-0) today at I p.m. and to
morrow at 2 p.m. in the Avery
Aquatit Center.

Saturday: Stanford vs. No. 5

Although tlx- Cardinal handily
defeated Arizona last year 147-90,
many swimmers on the squad
painfully remember their unex
pected home loss against Arizona
124-119. With this memory in
mind, they arc taking nothing for
granted this weekend.
"You can never underestimate

your competition if you want to
succeed." said junior tri-eaptain
John Waters. "We're taking this
meet very seriously. This is early in
the conference for them too, and
it's going to be a dogfight."
Senior tri-captain Michael
C VNeil agreed.
"They're not going to la\ down
for us. so we want to beat them
soundly and get hat k at Arizona,"
he said.
I he Cardinal will be expecting
Wildcats senior Roland S< hoe
man. an Olympian from South
Africa, to lead Arizona in the sprint
free events.
"They're going to be able to
challenge our best swimmers in
some events," (VNeil said.
Also looking to challenge the
Cardinal swimmers this weekend
will be the undefeated Sun Devils.
Despite the longest winning
streak ASI has seen in 10 years,
the Cardinal remains undaunted.
In fact, O'Neil had no trou
ble explaining why Arizona
State has found victory their
last live times out.
"They've gone live meets with
out fit ing Stanford."
fhe lotus of this weekend's
meets, however, is not just beating
t he Arizona schools, but preparing
lor the greater challenges that lie
ahead.
"This weekend will be a good
chance to get to know the compe
tition we'll have to swim against at
I'ae-lOs and then at NCAAs," saitl
Ireshman |ayme ('.ramcr.
"We need to start a trend that
everyboch swims well, and that we
don't just look it> our best guys,"
()"Neil addetl.

Competing two days in a row
will also be good practice for the
Cardinal men as they prepare for
(lie championship meets, whi< h
will require multiple days of men
tal focus and physical strength.
"One day of dual meet is pretty
tough," Waters said. "And to back
it up with another will require peo
ple to be a bit more focused and
take better care of themselves."
These early Pac-10 meets will
prove the met tle of the Cardinal.
" 1 his weekend leads us to
I 'SC. iu two weeks and to (lal two
weeks later, so we hope to set the
lone for the rest of our season,"
Waters said. "We'd like to get two
big wins and keep our momen
tum going. If we could beat Ari
zona and ASU, it would be a sign
of good things to come."
