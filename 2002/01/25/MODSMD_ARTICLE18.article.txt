## 
### AARON LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
I.OS A\(il.I.KS — l'his was
Julius Barnes' kind of 'game.
A fast-pat eel one.
()ne where he could run.
One where he could use his
quickness and get out on the
break.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Last night: No. 14 Stanford
86, No. 13 UCLA 76

And one where he could turn
and squeeze and side-step through
traffic whenever he wanted.
Hollywood Park might have
been 20 minutes away from Pauley
Pavilion. Santa Anita might have
been !i().
Hut Barnes created a rat etrat k
of his own I hursday night and
st oretl 23 points to lead the (Cardi
nal (12-4, 5-2 Pacific 1" Confer
ence) to an S()-7f> victory over the
Bruins, its fifth-straight over
UCLA (13-5, 5-3), in front of an
announced crowd of 12,243.
"I like to get out on the break
and push the tempo," Barnes said.
"That's when we can get easy bas
kets. I like that type of game a lot."
It seemed as though every time
the junior point guai tl penetrated,
the Cardinal scored, lime and
again, he drove to the basket and
created open shots, either foi him
self or for his teammates.

I lit- stage was set troin the be
ginning for the junioi point guard.
From the opening tipolf, the move
ment was quick, the intensity was
high and Karnes shined in the at
mosphere. I lr thrived on the dose
(overage. And best of all. he con
verted shots when the Cardinal
needed it the most.
Stanford held a lead with
7:26 left, and that's when Karnes
realh took over. First, he pulled
up and drained a 15-foot jumper.
I hen, he found junior wingman
Casey Jacobsen fora on
the wing. Finally, Karnes drove
the lane and drew a foul, and after
converting both free throws, the
Cardinal was up 12with3:'lJ logo.
It was a series of baskets that put
the game out of rea< h.
"To go in there and be part of
that run meant a lot to me,"
Karnes said.
Karnes played the point down
the stretch lor the first time since
Stanford's loss to Fcxas at the be
ginning of December. Mont
gomery said he slue k with Karnes
because he wanted his three best
perimeter players — Karnes. (lliil
dress and |acohsen — to all be in
the game at the same time.
Whatever the reason, Karnes
said he was thrilled to be out there.
Essentially, Stanford beat
I CI.A at its own game I hursday
night — they ran.


AAATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
Although he struggled early by shooting 2 of 9 in the first half, junior Casey
Jacobsen came up with big shots down the line, helping the No. 14 Cardi
nal hold off UCLA for its fifth-straight win in Pauley Pavilion.
Iliey ran up and down the
court as if tlirv were playing the
Washington schools ai Maples all
over again.
"IX LA is one of the best teams
in the country on the break," said
Jacobsen, who finished with 20
points. "We are getting better on
the break. Maybe we carried it
over a bit from last week."
Jacobsen struggled in the first
half, shooting only 2 of 9 from
the field and missing both 3-
point attempts.
Freshman Josh Childress,
however, filled Jacobsen's shoes
as a storing threat, as he scored
10 first-hall points, including
two 3-pointers and a thrilling
reverse la) up.
Not only did Childress finish
with 1 I points, he also picked up
12 rebounds to earn his first career
double-double.
"For him to be that skinny and
to get those boards helps us a lot,"
Barnes said.
I he night was even more spe
cial for Childress, a graduate of
