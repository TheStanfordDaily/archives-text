A packed auditorium witnessed an
event giving thanks to activists of the
past and offering inspiration to those of
the future Wednesday night, as stu
dents, alumni, administrators and com
munity members experienced "Stan
ford: 1968 Revisited."
The audience heard from members of
a renowned group of student-activists
who had seized the microphone during ,\
1968 Stanford colloquium following the

assassination of Martin Luther King, jr.
After taking the microphone from then-
Provost Richard Lyman, the students
made 10 demands concerning racial
equality and academic reform.
1 he event marked the group's first re
union in more than 30 years.
The panel consisted of five of the stu
dents who helped sei/et lie ink in 190S,as
well as long-time Hast Palo Alto social ac -
tivist Robert Hoover and William
Wyman, dean of students at the time,
fames Gibbs, former director of the pro
gram in African and Afro-American Stud
ies, served as moderator.
1 he discussion centered on questions
concerning what happened after the stu
dents took the stage and what students
can do today.
Hoover stressed that "building com

munity is what ought to happen when you
put the inic down. [Stanford] is not our
community, it's a resource."
Hoover pointed to the fact that after
graduation, a number ofthe students who
had taken the microphone, including
panelist Frank j. Omowale Satterwhite,
moved to Last Palo Alto to help lead and
build the community.
"What bothers me is that I don't see
many black students in Last Palo Alto any
more," Hoover said "We need you des
perately. join us in continuing to build
this community."
Satterwhite pointed to the lessons he
learned when he helped to take the stage,
recalling that fellow activist Keni Wash
ington stressed the need to "build a broad

consensus, draw a line in the sand
and don't blink."
The need to build a broad con
sensus was echoed throughout the
evening. Although panelists were
impressed that the number ol l>l;u k
organizations on campus had risen
from one to ilO, they expressed a
need to work together lor a com
mon goal. Washington suggested
that all the black groups "have an
annual get-together."
Moderator (iibbs suggested that
something be done about the de
creasing size of the faculty in the
African-American Studies pro
gram.
Delores Mack, a 1908 activist,
said she could not tell other people
what to risk â€” rather, they must

ask themselves what is important
to them.
"What is important is that you
do risk something ... it can be very
small... but do something other
than sit on the l .aitli, cat lood and
die," she said.
Irene St. Roseman, who works at
Atherton High School, expressed
concern that, while in 1908 there
was a "white sea of indifference,"
there is now a "black sea ol indiffer
ence ... there are those who sa\ m\
duty and responsibilit\ is lo mvscll
and no one else."
Leo Bazile, ('.lass of'7l, said,
" I hat indifference is what bugs me
about your generation. I lone-third
of blacks are still in poverty, that's
10 million blacks that need vour
help. (iel back to the black commu
nity."
Satterwhite disagreed on the
"indifference" point, and thanked
students for the work tliev have

done in hast I'alo Alto.
Provost .H in Ktchemench of
fered thanks to the panel members
on behalf of the institution.
"We [at Stanford] are all tremen
dous beneficiaries of what you've
done, what you started . . . we're
not finished vet, but we have made
some progress," he said.

saying that while she was pleased
with the turnout, she wished the

students."
