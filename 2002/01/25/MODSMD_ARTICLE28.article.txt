# Sundance: movies, moguls, models

It was 3:00 a.m. and I was camping out for tickets with
the Stanford Film Society at the Sundance Film Festival.
You'd try to talk, just to liven up the mood, but all that
came out were frozen white wraiths, drifting above your

head like thought bubbles. At most, it was 10 degrees out
side, and I was still shaking off a lingering hangover from
the Revlon party earlier that night.
Ticket buying is a serious business at the Sundance Film
Festival. We had sentries posted at the main ticket office
since midnight and we still weren't first in line — narrow
ly defeated by a rival brigade of Stanford zealots who'd ar
rived at 1 1 p.m. A woman arriving at 4 a.m., thinking she'd
gotten an early jump on the line, eyed us venomously,
spewing curses in an Eastern European tongue.
Ironically, 1 didn't even need the tickets, having previ
ously conned a press pass out of Sundance I leadquarters.
But for the less-fortunate multitudes, sleeping out for tick
ets is one of the only ways to ensure a glimpse of the some
of the big-name movies (the alternatives include buying
individual tickets online from a Web site that crashes when
you sneeze, or buying one of the festival passes that can
run up to $3000). Now it may strike you-as peculiar that an
Independent Film Festival should have so-called "Big-
Name Movies." Well, lemme tell ya, "independent" just
don't mean what it used to.
In 1981, in the quaint ski resort town of Park City,
Utah, Robert "The Sundance Kid" Redford founded the

Sundance Film Festival to breathe life into the American
small-time film scene. For better or for worse, Sundance
has since evolved into a <»lit/\ showcase floor for many pro
duction companies' most buzz-worthy prospei is. I his new
generation of "independent" films often boasts opulent
budgets, all-star casts (90 percent of which include Parker

Posey and /or Christina Ricci) and
pedigree directors.
Annually, from the dates of Jan.
10 to fan. 20, the once quiescent
town is besieged by a media
blitzkrieg. A boiling imbroglio <>112
Hollvwood's hippest citi/enry de
scend upon the city, ravaging its
sushi bars and clogging the narrow
avenues with limousines. I had
been told b\ other journalists that
the festival u.is more subdued this
year because of the cancerous im
print of Sept. 11. It seemed to me,
however, that Sundance still func -
tioned at feverish pitch, perhaps
even heightened more than usual
because of its proximity to the Salt
Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics.
This reminder was unavoidable, as
the Park Citv skyline was violated

ence grandstands in mid-construc
tion, all in preparation for the
downhill skiing events that would

spillover into Park City.
You'd think that the "independent" vibe would be suf
focated under the weight of celebrity infusion and Enter
tainment Tonight cameras, but a curious thing has hap
pened in Park City. Like minute creatures iu symbiosis
with their massive host, a slew of smaller, truly "indepen
dent" film festivals have sprung up under the Sundance
umbrella: Slamdance, Slamfunk, Nod a nee and Lapdatice
(much to my disappointment this was not an XXX-rated
festival). (ionsequenth. there's still a real hunger in the air
— the nervous excitement of first time directors who have
thrown all their chips in the pot.
Additional!). the advent of the digital video camera has lev
eled the playing field considerably. Now, almost anyone can
afford to go out and shoot a film with a high degree of profes
sionalism. What might be lost with the visual vibrancy of cellu
loid is compensated by the freedom to shoot hundreds of
hours of footage at minimal cost. This is particularly ground
breaking for the documentary genre, giving filmmakers the
freedom to leave their cameras on all the time, as opposed to
the stinginess of shot selection that film necessitates. Roughly
20 percent of the films I watched at Sundance had been shot
on DV,and some of them, like Rebecca Miller's "Personal Ve
locity," utilized it with a rather revolutionary

grate and beauty, which should help combat
the stigma held against the medium.
The biggest hoopla surrounding the fes
tival was fixated on Benecio Del Toro, who
was to be receiving the Piper-Hiedsieck Vi
sion Award — a vague honor given annual
ly to an actor who lias risen from the inde
pendent scene. 1 went to the press confer
ence .md it was remarkabh dull, comprised
mosth of Benecio grimacing as reporters
asked him inane questions like "What does
it mean to you to be Benecio Del Toro?"
1 was much more excited about the hype
surrounding two promising new films —
"Stolen Summer,' directed by Pete Jones,
and "Storytelling" directed by Todd
Solondz. "Stolen Slimmer" was already
highly publicized, having been the subject
of Miramax and HBO's Project Greenlight.
To be honest, I went into the film with

abysmal expectations, thinking the only reason it was ad
mitted into the festival was due to its extremely visible pro
tile. I was joyously in error. It's an exquisite film with
heart-wrenching performances bv Kevin Pollack and
Aidan Quinn and a script wrought from a deep well of af
fection and humor. Every woman in the press-room was in
tears... 1 may have had something stuck in my eye.
Concise evaluation for Todd Solond/'s "Storytelling" is
a little more elusive. Alreadv famous for Sundance award
winners like "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Happi
ness," Solond/ has created an indelibly beautiful and
provocative film that only narrowlv escaped .1 NC-17 rat
ing. Selma Blair and John (loodman deliver haunting per
formances that compliment a highly intelligent script,
which is as genuinely disturbing as it is darkly comic. As we
filed out of the press screening room, there was a sort of
nervous elect 1 i< it\ crackling among the journalists. On the
shuttle ride back to Main Street, all anyone could do was
talk about the film.
I here existed a sort of fraternal community among the
press (sharing criticism about'films,-spreading the word
about hot parties that evening), but it's important to note
that this effusive friendliness seemed to extend to every
one in Park City, bewitching the entire festivities. The rea-

sons for this, I believe, are two-fold. First, the cit\ is satu
rated with avid cinephiles who feed off one another's en
thusiasm; and secondly, there's an certain degree of
celebrity anonymit\ that keeps everyone on their best be
havior. Von just can't afford to be brusque with some
sell mo trying to get a table in vour restaurant because he
might be the president of 11 B(). or |ohn I utturro, or an
up-and-coming director who'll buy out your restaurant
and publich lire von once he makes it big.
I his phenomenon became fortuitousl) clear after re
ceiving the royal treatment at a well-publicized party spon
sored In the Revion company. I had foolishly arrived .it
the part\ knowing full well that I had no chance of getting
in. I here was a line outside the door about thirty bodies
deep of people who, unlike mvself, were actually on the guest
list. Furthermore, the party was infested with gorgeous


Howdy partner.


I've something to tell you, Bobby
