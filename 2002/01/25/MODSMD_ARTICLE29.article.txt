# Can Tamango do the Fandango?
## 
### KIM SAMEK 
I don't know if it makes ii better or
worse knowing that an unspectacular
performance has come from a spectac-

ular place, lap dancer-musician
chore o g r a p h e r - wo r 1 d t r a v e 1 e r
"Tamango" is one of those rare artists
who has a knack for finding beauty in
unlikely places.
He grew up in French Guyana and
Paris, where he began tap dancing at
the late age of 21 from a teacher he
soon out-danced. He eventually
moved through Europe and to New
York, picking up unorthodox instru
ments and people along the way. He
has a real passion and genuine curios
ity that drives him to create his strange
ensemble of tap, capoeira and music.
The real shame is that this raw qual
ity is not easily conveyed through his
project, "Urban lap," which came to
Memorial Auditorium last Friday.
"Urban Tap" begins with a long in
strumental introduction, as Tamango
beats a drum from the back of the au

dience. After slowly making his way to
the stage, he eventually begins a solo
— the first of many, interspersed with
solos from other members of the
group, as well as other uneventful ex
plorations of sound through music.
The show's biggest Haw lies in its
lac k of cohesion. Going into the per
formance, I knew this was no ordinary
tap show. Tamango combines his
unique cultural heritage into his tap
dancing. However, I did not expect
the cultural influence to be so heavy
handed. He could benefit from the
"less is more" ideology.
It's not even that so much of the
piece focused on his cultural heritage,
but more that it was not well blended
into the show. The fascinating instru
ments, the Hashing images, the varied
dancing were not at all experimental,
but came off as rather a random mix of
"The Things That Make Up Taman
go's Life." His use of background
video, an old trick iu the world of rock
shows, was especially haphazard and
distracting. Often, the musical seg
ments carried on for too long — obvi
ous filler space as Tamango rested up
for his next solo.
Although the dancers and musicians
were talented, few offered any fresh in
sights into sound or dance. "Urban
Tap" features a break dancer who of
fered nothing more than what 1 saw
from student performances at my high

school assemblies. I have to say the real
star of tlu- show was the Brazilian
capoeira dancer "Cabello," who began
the show playing with the band but
popped out to perform amazing feats
of strength and balance to rival
Olympic gymnasts. He suspended
himself with ease at angles one could
not even imagine.
Tamango himself was quite uncre
ative with the taps. His simple, monot
onous tapping quickly lost my atten
tion. Being a tap dancer myself, I spent
most of my time watching his feet.
Once I finally glanced up to the rest of
his body, 1 was definitely more im
pressed and understood how he
charmed the audience. And no, it was
not his well-chiseled six-pack that
caught my attention. Tamango is a
uniquely charismatic dancer — cer
tainly a natural with an amazing com
mand of his body.
Perhaps he should consider work
ing fora choreographer other than
himself. Although dancing for other
people no longer suits his artistic
ideals (he recently toured with River
dance for two years and swore lie
would never dance in a company
again), his charisma can only carry
him so far. On stage, he tells the audi
ence they are amazed by his taps. He is
a bit over-confident. He speaks in
cliches about energy and art. So far it's
all tell and no show.
