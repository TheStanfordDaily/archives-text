### EREZ YOELI 
The San Francisco Sympho- |
ny was fortunate last Friday: <
despite disappointing perlor- I
mances from both orcliestra i
and soloist, the evening's spec- i
tacnlar all-Liszt program car- <
tied its own weight and did not I
let the audience down. i
l lu' concert was comprised !
ol only two pieces: "Totentaz,"
sometimes referred to as Liszt's i
third piano concerto, and"A t
Faust Symphony," which lasted t
for well over an hour. The first J
is a marvelously difficult work i

based on the "Dies Irae" theme
— the 13th Century Latin
chant upon which so many
Romantic composers based
their more morbid pieces.
Liszt, whose obsession with
death led to a large quan
tity of such works, builds
"Dies Irae" into a short but
overwhelming piece, which
should leave the pianist and
the audience breathless.
The evening's performer,
Konstantin Lifschit/, may well
have been breathless, but the
audience was not. Ilis perfor
mance lacked soloistic flair and
was often messy; Lifschit/ left
phrases unfinished and
crescendos hanging. Rarely did
he blend well with the orches
tra and in no place was this
more evident than the solemn
opening chords of the piece,
lie often rushed, despite his
religious gaze at Sir Roger
Norrington, the conductor.
Fortunately for SI S, Nor
rington helped make up for
the sagging "Totentaz" with
the first movement of the
Symphony, in which the com
poser's brilli<mt orchestration

and lively melodies shone. Un
fortunately, he could not retain
the orchestra's attention or en
thusiasm for long, and the
piece soon felt like a long tech
nical drill. Had it not been for
the inspired performance by
the choir at the end, the Sym
phony, too, might have sank.
Nonetheless, I would not
give up on SFS. This week, they
play Ravel and Beethoven, and
in two weeks Tilson I homas re
turns to lead them in Berlioz's
"Romeo and |uliet." Next
month includes performances
of Mahler and an appearance
by (iil Shaham — a consistently
fantastic performer. If you do
choose to attend any of these
performances, remember to
show the ticket agent your
Si ll): student tickets to the
symphony are a steal.
