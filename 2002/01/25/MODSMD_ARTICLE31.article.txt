# Goldsworthy makes art from nature
## 
### ERIC HAND 
Andy Goldsworthy, who, along
with Richard Long, was one of the
founding fathers of the British
landscape art tradition, looks like
he could use a shower. I le has got
dirt lodged under his chipped fin
gernails and his disheveled gray
hair seems to have been styled by a
sweaty hat. A blue tattoo on his
forearm peeks out from his thread
hare fleece, a reminder of a physi-

cal life that has in
cluded laboring,
gardening and
fanning.
But tliere Is noth
ing roughshod ;ilxnit
Goldswotthy's per
sonality or his art.
lie is a gentle,
soft-spoken man,
careful and articu
late with his
words. Similarly,
his fragile and
transient art often
speaks with a
quiet insistence.

Most of the time, Goldsworthy
ventures into the fields and forests
near his Scottish home with no
plans. Using only his hands and
whatever nature might offer on
that day — berries, thorns, reeds
— he assembles delicate structures
and executes subtle transforma
tions that may only last a moment.
He creates spiraling frozen fili
grees by spit-welding icicles
around a tree. He arranges rocks
on a mountain-side scree pile so
that a tortuous path is revealed
only at a certain light-reflecting
hour each day. And he meticulous
ly slathers a scarlet sand-paste over
every inch of a dead, craggy tree
until it is blooming with new life.
1 le insists that he is not a nature
artist, for he is preoccupied not so

much with unsullied natural beau
ty as he is the interaction of man
with the landscape. In his rain and
frost shadow pieces, (ioldsworthy
literally imprints himself upon the
landscape.
His new Stanford sculpture,
"Stone River," is an anomaly in his
oeuvre, both in terms of the larger
scale and the degree of perma
nence. Sitting discreetly in a de
pression in front of Cantor Arts

Center, "Stone
River" is a golden
sandstone wall that
winds and tapers
from one edge of
the bowl to the
other. The build
ing stones, taken
from decimated
campus buildings
after the 1906 and
1989 earthquakes,
are seamlessly
crafted into (he
form and evoke the
stolid engineering
structures that

man, time and time again, erects
on the landscape. The serpentine
fluidity of the form, however,
evokes the inexorable natural
processes — time, earthquakes —
that will eventually consume all of
Stanford's buildings, is it the foun
dation fora new building, rising
from the earth? Or are the stones
the sole remains of a ruined civi
lization? Like an archaeological
dig, "Stone River" sits at the inter
section of deep time and con
structed history.
On the eve of the sculpture's in
auguration last week, Intermission
spoke with Goldsworthy directly
about "Stone River," as well his
other projects.
Intermission: Stanford has
what's called "The Bone-yard,"
with all the sandstone and marble

[building stones]. Did you travel
to the Bone-yard and pick out the
sandstone?
Goldsworthy: When I first came,
I proposed the form. Then I was
told about the Bone-yard. The
idea of stone that was once used
for building — that is now being
returned back into the ground,
into the earth. Fora work that is
about flow, movement and
change, it was perfect. It had this
human element.
And the reason why I put it below
ground was to weld it to the earth,
and to give a feeling that you've
just so aped away one small por
tion of something that may be
much, much larger.
I: The serpentine form, is th.it
from water, from a river?
G: 1 call it a river, but it's not a river.
There are rivers of wind, rivers of
rain, rivers of birds. It's more about
flow. I think that's what the form is
about: extracting a sense of move
ment in the materials.
I: So many of your works are
ephemeral. Why is that?
G: I think when 1 first began work
ing, it was about the moment. The
moment in which I made the piece
was the most important thing.
Then 1 realized you had to consid
er what has gone before. Vou have
to understand the history behind
that moment to understand the
stone, the life of the stone, the jour
ney the stone has made.
And then 1 also try to understand
and deal with the future. Not to
control it, but to make work that
will become active or have a life in
the future.
I: So some of your works are start
ing to deal with time outside of

your life-time?
G: I've become
aware that the
place I work has
been made rich by
the people that
have worked the
landscape. And
you leel layer upon
layer of people.
There is a strong
social nature to my
work that is not re
ally understood.
And the British
landscape has
taught me that —
and tlnit I am the
next layer.
I: Were you a mad
man on the beach
growing up, build
ing things?

G: I think I had a normal child
hood .. . but art has been the only
thing I could do. Memories of
building dams in the woods —
sure, those are important to me.
But it was with farming that the
sculptural possibilities of the land
scape were made strong: the stack
ing of hay, plowing a field, laying a
hedge, building a wall — all very
sculptural. And that informed me,
1 think.
I: Did you always photograph
your works?

G: I began working
as a student in art
school. I had to ex
plain to my lectur
ers what I was
doing, so I'd show
them my pho
tographs. It's an ex
planation. I.ike
Brancusi said, 'It's
like (the sculptures]
talking.'
I: Do you view
photography as
merely documen
tary or do ymi try
to enliven your

works in some way?
G: I'd say enliven is the wrong
word. Photography is a way of ex
ploring and articulating some of
the ideas and feelings I have about
it. I.ike what I've been doing today
— ["Stone River"] is a piece that
can be seen only through a whole
day photographing it.
The reason is that a sculpture isn't
just about the stufTit's made of. It's
about space, light and time. And
that sculptures sometimes sleep
and sometimes wake up. They
have a life. And photography is a
wonderful way of exploring and
articulating that life.
II I'm working with a leaf, it's the

growth I'm trying to understand.
If a stone, I'm trying to understand
the energies and processes in the
stone. I want to understand the
flesh as well as the bone.
I: What's the most enjoyable part
of the process?
G: There are moments of such
pleasure and beauty that it takes
your breath away. But that's un
derwritten by so much that doesn't
work, painfully collapses, blew
away on the brink of finishing the
piece. So the work is very much

tied to fragility and
pain. And loss. 1 feel a
sense of loss when a
sculpture collapses be
fore its time.
I: Yon work on your
neighbors' lands. How
do they feel about it?
G: In some ways it's
kind of difficult to
work on other peo
ples' lands. But in an
other way it's very
good for me. It would
be very easy for me to
buy my own farm. Bui

that would forfeit this social di
mension ofthe landscape. That, at
any moment, someone could
come across me and want to know
what I'm doing and talk about
what I'm doing. That is irritating
at times, but in the bigger picture
it's very important to have that.
And in Britain we have public
rights-of-way, so everybody has ac
cess to the landscape. And that's
one thing I miss here in America.
11 ere you have to go to state parks,
national parks, get in the car and
drive. 1 like to work within walking
distance of where I'm staying. I
think everybody should be able to
do that, no matter where they live.
