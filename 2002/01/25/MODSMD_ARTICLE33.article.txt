# Actor doesn't take acting too seriously
## But Schwartzman 'respects the shit out of it' 
### ANTHONY HA 
[ason Schwartzman made his
movie debut in director Wes An
derson's gloriously quirky come
(U "Ruslimore. Schwartzman's
Nla\ Fist her, an ambit ions
icenager involved in every extra
curricular activity imaginable
while failing his classes, was the
heart of the film, and Schwartz
man's performance was unforget
table. 11 <* perfect!) balanced
Max s genius, his loneliness and
Ins childishness.
Both the film and Schwartz
man received glowingly positive
reviews, and his next film,
"Slackers," opens on Feb. 1. He
plays Ethan, a borderline psy
chotic college student who, after
finding proof that some other
students (Devon Sawa, Jason
Segel and Michael C. Maronna)
i heated on a test, threatens to get
them expelled unless they hook
him up with the girl of his
diearns (James King).
"Slackers" is directed by fash
ion photographer and commer
cial director Dewey Nicks, and the
script is written by David 11. Stein
berg. The film alternates between
gross-out bathroom humor, in
ventive fantasy sequences and a
sentimental message about being
honest and finding true love (or
something like that).
Schwartzinan's Ethan echoes
Max's geekiness in many ways,
but he's a Max gone totally psycho
— a stalker, blackmailer and all
around creep. Where Max was
oddly endearing, Ethan is annoy
ing and a little bit frightening.
In person, Schwartzman has
little in common with either of the
two characters. In an interview at

the San Francisco Ritz-Carlton,
he seemed talkative and hyper,
but easy-going. Fhroughout the
interview, lie switched seamlessly
between sincerity and humor, try
ing to scare reporters entering his
room In hiding behind his door
and jumping out (he ended up
si aring the publicity gu\ instead),
and filling the conversation with
goofball impressions and voices.
Looking back at the initial re
ception of "Ruslimore," Schwartz
man expressed bemuseinent at the
enthusiasm of the press's praise
for his work.
It was like, 'What?'," lie said.
"I didn't pay too much close at
tention; I try not to. To me, the
fun is the process. You know,
doing it."
"It wouldn't have mattered,"
he said. " I hat's a lie. Look, it was
m\ first time ever trying acting.
And it was such a scary experi
ence, that if the movie just got
horrible reviews, I mean, it would
have been sad. because I thought
I put a lot into it. Hut at the same
time, I had such a great time
doing it, that it wouldn't have
mattered."
According to S( hwartznian, he
first became acquainted with the
director of "Slackers" when Nicks
dated his cousin, Sofia Coppola.
When he heard that Nicks was di
recting a film, Schwartzman was
eager to get involved.
"I think he's got good taste;
he's a good photographer,"
Schwartzman said. "So I met with
him and it was just, like, 'Hev,
we're friends, let's just have a
good time, let's do it." you know?"
It was good because the role
called for being really crazy, and I
didn't want to be crazy around

someone I didn't know/'
"Slackers" is filled with physi
cal comedy, and, as the most over
the-top character in the film,
Schwartzman definitely takes
part in his share of antics.
Schwartzman explained that as
someone who admires Peter Sell
ers, the Three Stooges and Jim
Carrey, he really enjoyed that as
pect of the movie.
"It was just a blast, it was siu ha
fucking blast," he s;iid. " There is
something funny to me about
watching someone do something
funny to their bodies as op-

t j — r
posed to having to think
about a joke."
"I think physical comedy
occurs more in my daih life
than, uh, mind comedy," he
added. "But whatever, you
know, I fall down, 1 thump
into shit all the time, and it's
just funny... It was really
good to try and do it. I was so
happy and so nervous and I
took a lot of punishment, but
it was fun ... Definitely get
massages, though. I didn't
get them on that movie, but
next time 1 do physical. I'm
doing massages."
In both of his motion
picture roles so far,
Schwartzman has played
characters who are, to a cer
tain extent, geeks and lon
ers. When I asked him if he
identified with outsiders, he
was ambivalent.

"My high school was so small
that you could feel like an out
sider on Monday and then feel
like the most popular guv in
school on Friday, because it just
was an ever-changing thing," he
explained. "I guess sometimes 1
relate to walking into a party and
walking out five minutes later.
But no, I think I'm a jock at heart
with nerdy qualities."
Schwartzman also talked about
his habits on the set, saying that
he always listens to music and has
his guitar, recorder and drum
machine.
"It's important, I think, when
you're doing anything artistic to
have another artistic thing
going on," he said. "Or any
thing else going on — a book
you're involved with, something,
else to have."
Schwartzman's interest in
music is evident in "Slackers," for
which he wrote two songs: "Oh
Angela" and "Fthan's Song." He
has been the drummer for the Los
Angeles-based band Phantom
Planet since before he began act
ing. When another reporter
brought up Phantom Planet,
Schwartzman enthusiastically
plugged the group's new (11).
"Dude, the band's called Phan
tom Planet," he said. "The album
is called ' The Guest.' Conies out
Feb. 2f>. The video's going to M2
next week; I'm so nervous. It's ;i
rock <md roll band: three guitars,
one bass and some live drums.

Enjoy it."
Looking at the range in
Schwartzman's activities, I was
curious if he had any other artis
tic interests.
"You know, this sounds weird,
but I'd love (o become the creative
director of some kind of advertis
ing firm." he said. "(loine up with
jingles, one-liners, like headliners
like, 'Milk — isn't it white?' . . .
I'm just interested in everything.
I'm just thankful I can do two —
I'm thankful I can do one."
Throughout the interview,
Schwartzman repeatedly di*-
playecl a genuine love for acting
and the process for movie-making,
an enthusiasm that he had a little
trouble explaining.
"I like working with other tal
ented people and having some
thing I love be a complete mystery
and unattainable," he said. "I love
being really cheesy. The truth is,
man, I try not to take it too seri
ously, and at the same time try |t<»|
respect the shit out of it. Because
it's a verv powerful thing, the act
ing, but there's nothing worse
than an actor who takes himself
too seriously
He thought a little, then
added. "Do vou know why you
breathe? You just do it naturally.
[Acting] feels like breathing to
me. It feels like I have to do it or 1
wouldn't be able to live. I lie same
with music, \ou know? I feel like
ill didn't have music, a part oi me
would just die."

[ason Schwartzman made his
movie debut in director Wes An

while failing his classes, was the

man's performance was unforget

Max s genius, his loneliness and

Both the film and Schwartz
man received glowingly positive
reviews, and his next film,
"Slackers," opens on Feb. 1. He
plays Ethan, a borderline psy
chotic college student who, after
finding proof that some other
students (Devon Sawa, Jason
Segel and Michael C. Maronna)
i heated on a test, threatens to get
them expelled unless they hook
him up with the girl of his
diearns (James King).
"Slackers" is directed by fash
ion photographer and commer
cial director Dewey Nicks, and the
script is written by David 11. Stein
berg. The film alternates between
gross-out bathroom humor, in
ventive fantasy sequences and a
sentimental message about being
honest and finding true love (or
something like that).
Schwartzinan's Ethan echoes
Max's geekiness in many ways,
but he's a Max gone totally psycho
— a stalker, blackmailer and all
around creep. Where Max was
oddly endearing, Ethan is annoy
ing and a little bit frightening.
In person, Schwartzman has
little in common with either of the
two characters. In an interview at

the San Francisco Ritz-Carlton,
he seemed talkative and hyper,
but easy-going. Fhroughout the
interview, lie switched seamlessly
between sincerity and humor, try
ing to scare reporters entering his
room In hiding behind his door
and jumping out (he ended up
si aring the publicity gu\ instead),
and filling the conversation with
goofball impressions and voices.
Looking back at the initial re
ception of "Ruslimore," Schwartz
man expressed bemuseinent at the
enthusiasm of the press's praise
for his work.
It was like, 'What?'," lie said.
"I didn't pay too much close at
tention; I try not to. To me, the
fun is the process. You know,
doing it."
"It wouldn't have mattered,"
he said. " I hat's a lie. Look, it was
m\ first time ever trying acting.
And it was such a scary experi
ence, that if the movie just got
horrible reviews, I mean, it would
have been sad. because I thought
I put a lot into it. Hut at the same
time, I had such a great time
doing it, that it wouldn't have
mattered."
According to S( hwartznian, he
first became acquainted with the
director of "Slackers" when Nicks
dated his cousin, Sofia Coppola.
When he heard that Nicks was di
recting a film, Schwartzman was
eager to get involved.
"I think he's got good taste;
he's a good photographer,"
Schwartzman said. "So I met with
him and it was just, like, 'Hev,
we're friends, let's just have a
good time, let's do it." you know?"
It was good because the role
called for being really crazy, and I
didn't want to be crazy around

someone I didn't know/'
"Slackers" is filled with physi
cal comedy, and, as the most over
the-top character in the film,
Schwartzman definitely takes
part in his share of antics.
Schwartzman explained that as
someone who admires Peter Sell
ers, the Three Stooges and Jim
Carrey, he really enjoyed that as
pect of the movie.
"It was just a blast, it was siu ha
fucking blast," he s;iid. " There is
something funny to me about
watching someone do something
funny to their bodies as op-

t j — r
posed to having to think
about a joke."
"I think physical comedy
occurs more in my daih life
than, uh, mind comedy," he
added. "But whatever, you
know, I fall down, 1 thump
into shit all the time, and it's
just funny... It was really
good to try and do it. I was so
happy and so nervous and I
took a lot of punishment, but
it was fun ... Definitely get
massages, though. I didn't
get them on that movie, but
next time 1 do physical. I'm
doing massages."
In both of his motion
picture roles so far,
Schwartzman has played
characters who are, to a cer
tain extent, geeks and lon
ers. When I asked him if he
identified with outsiders, he
was ambivalent.

"My high school was so small
that you could feel like an out
sider on Monday and then feel
like the most popular guv in
school on Friday, because it just
was an ever-changing thing," he
explained. "I guess sometimes 1
relate to walking into a party and
walking out five minutes later.
But no, I think I'm a jock at heart
with nerdy qualities."
Schwartzman also talked about
his habits on the set, saying that
he always listens to music and has
his guitar, recorder and drum
machine.
"It's important, I think, when
you're doing anything artistic to
have another artistic thing
going on," he said. "Or any
thing else going on — a book
you're involved with, something,
else to have."
Schwartzman's interest in
music is evident in "Slackers," for
which he wrote two songs: "Oh
Angela" and "Fthan's Song." He
has been the drummer for the Los
Angeles-based band Phantom
Planet since before he began act
ing. When another reporter
brought up Phantom Planet,
Schwartzman enthusiastically
plugged the group's new (11).
"Dude, the band's called Phan
tom Planet," he said. "The album
is called ' The Guest.' Conies out
Feb. 2f>. The video's going to M2
next week; I'm so nervous. It's ;i
rock <md roll band: three guitars,
one bass and some live drums.

Enjoy it."
Looking at the range in
Schwartzman's activities, I was
curious if he had any other artis
tic interests.
"You know, this sounds weird,
but I'd love (o become the creative
director of some kind of advertis
ing firm." he said. "(loine up with
jingles, one-liners, like headliners
like, 'Milk — isn't it white?' . . .
I'm just interested in everything.
I'm just thankful I can do two —
I'm thankful I can do one."
Throughout the interview,
Schwartzman repeatedly di*-
playecl a genuine love for acting
and the process for movie-making,
an enthusiasm that he had a little
trouble explaining.
"I like working with other tal
ented people and having some
thing I love be a complete mystery
and unattainable," he said. "I love
being really cheesy. The truth is,
man, I try not to take it too seri
ously, and at the same time try |t<»|

Throughout the interview,
Schwartzman repeatedly di*-
playecl a genuine love for acting
and the process for movie-making,
an enthusiasm that he had a little
trouble explaining.
"I like working with other tal
ented people and having some
thing I love be a complete mystery
and unattainable," he said. "I love
being really cheesy. The truth is,
man, I try not to take it too seri
ously, and at the same time try |t<»|
respect the shit out of it. Because
it's a verv powerful thing, the act
ing, but there's nothing worse
than an actor who takes himself
too seriously
He thought a little, then
added. "Do vou know why you
breathe? You just do it naturally.
[Acting] feels like breathing to
me. It feels like I have to do it or 1
wouldn't be able to live. I lie same
with music, \ou know? I feel like
ill didn't have music, a part oi me
would just die."
