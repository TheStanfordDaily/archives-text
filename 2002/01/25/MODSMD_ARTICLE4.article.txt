# Institute to promote diversity in the arts
## Program aims to use art as a tool to examine identity and culture 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR 
The newly-established Stanford
Irvine Institute for Diversity in the
Arts lias set out to probe issues of
diversity and identity in Califor
nia, using art as a "tool" through
which students communicate their
thoughts and emotions.
Originally a vision of the late
English I'rof. Charles Lyons, the
institute has received its funding
from the James Irvine Foundation
and is currently headed by Drama
I'rof. I larry l\lam.
The institute began at the out
set of this quarter as a part of the
Drama Department, but Assoc. Di
rector (ieorgina I lernande/ said it
will soon expand its rea< h to other
departments.
"The program seeks to aug
ment and enhance the academic
environment at Stanford, using art
as a vehicle to look into issues of di
versity," Hernandez said.
While the notion of art being
used as a communications tool
may seem perplexing at first,
Elam said he views art as some
thing more than a manifestation
ofemotions.
"Art is what moves you ... I
don't know where that comes
from," Elam said. By engaging
people's creativity, "art allows indi
viduals to take their thoughts to

levels unreachable by everyday
modes of communication."
According to Elam, the tragedies
of Sept. I 1 served as a driving force
to turn the idea into reality.
"Post 9/ 11, life has changed,"
Elam said. "The power of art has
been reaffirmed."
In response to this change,
Elam said the institute will look at
ways to increase the representa
tion of individuals in and around
the Stanford community, to re
assert the notion of individual
identity by turning "personal sto
ries into art."
" I hrough various programs,
artists tell stories about issues and
real experiences of diversity in
their lives" Martinez added. Aside
from diversity in identity, the pro
gram probes diversity in the aits,
spoken word, performance art
and story telling.
I he institute's first program —
"Cartographies of Race: Mapping
Race and Space in California" —
examines issues of diversity
throughout local communities.
The program includes a
< ourse for students and a series of
Thursday lectures featuring
scholars and artists whose talks
will explore the ways in which art
affects people's views toward the
interplay of race and geography
in California.
()n March 15, students involved
in the program will bring their ideas
together and give a number of per
formances and exhibitions in the
Stanford Art Gallery to display their
ac hievements.
