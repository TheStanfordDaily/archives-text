tional $ 1.5 million from an anonymous benefactor.
'Fhe money will be used to provide unrestricted re
search stipends to the winners.
"In the past few years, we have expanded and im
proved programs in undergraduate education,"
Ftchemendy said. "Our goal [now] is to find and rec
ognize some of the faculty most dedicated to under
graduate educatk >n."
John Bravman, vice provost for undergraduate
education, announced tlie first eight winners at the
meeting.
Fhe winners are: John Boothroyd, professor of mi
crobiology and immunology; Thomas Byers, professor

In other business, Robert Reidy, manager of the
Stanford Management (lorporation, presented a re
port on new faculty housing.
'Fhe new housing proposal represents 790 new
housing units; some of the proposed units will be tar-
geted toward fiuult) members,
while others will he targeted toward
post-doctoral students.
Reidy emphasized that the I ni
versity must carefulh plan its devel
opment because of spat e restraints
imposed by the (ienenil I se Permit.
"We don't have a tremendous
amount of land— we must maxi
mize densit\he s.tid.
Finalh, the (.01 limit tee on At ad
emu Computing and Intbrmation
Systems delivered its annual report
to the Senate.
I'liecommittee found that 50 per

cent of facult\ are not satisfied with
computer support at Stanford. This
finding is supported by past
reports — in 2000, the Computing
I ask Force found that "the most sig
nificant issue is severe underfunding
for computer support ."
1 lie report emphasized that
technology lias become a vital asset
for faculty and staff But as technol
ogy has become increasingly in
valuable for day-to-day operations,
requests for computer support
have skyrocketed.
In 1998, there were approximate
ly 10,000 requests for computer as
sistance; this \ear, the committee
projects 120,000 requests.
The committee suggested a
ratio of one specialist with disc ipli

nary expertise per 40 faculty, and
also recommended that faculty
computers be replaced every
three years.
Some senate members noted
that computer support was uneven
across the University.
"In some places in the school of
I lumanities and Sciences, they are
relatively well served," Klam said.
"Bin in other places, it seems like
the 19705."
Economics Prof. Roger Noll
lauded, the committee lor its work
to improve computer services, but
he noted that some faculty need
more support than others.
" There are some faculty out
there who just can't function in the
real world," he said.
