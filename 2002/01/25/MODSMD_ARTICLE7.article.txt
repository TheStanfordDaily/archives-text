She graduated with a IVS. in computer science
<iiul a minor in lnstot \.

Since she graduated, I eng has Ixvn per
forming .ill over the Kay Area, starting out with
open-mic shows in the South H.i\ before moving

l eng wrote a lot of her songs as an under
graduate, so last night she enjoyed sharing with

ing her dream and doing what
she loves," I .e said.
