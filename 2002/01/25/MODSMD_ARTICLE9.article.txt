# The
						Daily gets a Y chromosome
## Though he be hut little, he is fierce. Junior Mark Boucher gets drunk, eats cake 
### DEREK JETER CONTRIBUTING YANKEE 
With a resounding kick to the
file cabinet, Mark"Bouch" Bouch
er, a strapping 4-foot-9, 83-pound
junior, welcomed a new volume to
The Daily in true Jersey style.
"Every editorial is going to be
about football," shrieked the exu
berant Boucher after winning an
uncontested election for the high
ly-coveted position of Daily editor
in chief. Megan Kni/.e, widely con
sidered to be a lock for ihe posi
tion, mysteriously withdrew from
the race less than two days before
the election.
Despite the strange circum
stances under which Boucher even
tually won the professionally-run
election, ("I should vote ... wait, is
the election over?" he said), current
editor in chief .Mice Brown seemed
relieved at the outcome.
" Thank God!" she gushed. "We
finally have an econ major to rescue
us from that . . . uh . . . financial
problem."
Some Daily editors questioned
the validity of the election, because
Boucher was the first editor in 7H
years who did not undergo rigor
ous interrogations from former
photo editor Sasha Mitelman, who
was apparently sidelined with he
morrhoids and sinus problems.
Clad in his usual natty pair of
khakis pulled up to his chin and a
"salmon" fuschia pink button-down
shirt from Brooks Brothers, Bouch

er celebrated bis win by drinking an
entire box of cheap red wine and
eating Haifa bag of pretzels.
Not present for the celebration
was News Editor Carolyn Lin.
Reached at her home, Liu said,
"It's just too painful. 1 bough he
never brought me bread and olive
oil, I still yearn for some of that hot
Bouch lovin'."
Co-News Editor Benjamin L.
Friedland countered with, "I'll com
fort you, baby."
Boucher, who bails from the
best second-rate prep school on the
East Coast, announced plans to
create a "New Jersey Editor,"

which could be filled by any num
ber of current editorial staffers,
such as Greg Page, Eric Hand,
Nemil Dalai or Friedland.
Wire Editor Yasi 1 fashemi, also
from Jerz, appeared at midnight,
saying, "Alice, is there a party?"
Gone from the office will be the
strains of "Friends," the casual
dress code and perhaps most sig
nificantly. the Innovation editors.
After bis victory celebrations,
the NRA-card-carrying Bouch
promptly took the "expendable"
section's editors behind the office
and . . . well, they are currently
"unavailable for comment."

Having already gotten a head start on his victory celebration ("I drank
RRUUMM!!!"), junior Mark Boucher was not afraid to swig repeatedly
from the bottle of expensive champagne purchased for him from the deep
Daily coffers.
