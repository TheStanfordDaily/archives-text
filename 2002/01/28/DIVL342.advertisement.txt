The Tipping Point, a best seller
in 2000, has now become a
phenomenon unto itself, exploring
how social epidemics take off and
spread like wildfire. Marketing Guru Malcolm
Gladwell, now a writer for
The New Yorker, will discuss this book
in celebration of its paperback release.
The discussion will be followed by a
Q&A session moderated by Stanford Graduate
School of Business Professor, Chip Heath and a
Book Signing. Admission is Free.
