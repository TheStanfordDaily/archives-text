CALIFORNIA
Clemency has become
a rare commodity in
California
SAN QUENTIN (Al') — The last California gov
ernor to grant a reprieve to a condemned man wasn't
a liberal Democrat or even a moderate Republican. It
was conservative standard-bearer Ronald Reagan,
and the year was 1967.
I bis month, Stephen Wayne Anderson, scheduled
to die Tuesday, became the latest condemned man to
lose a plea for mercy when his clemency petition was
turned down by Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday.
Anderson's lawyers had made it clear they didn't
expect a reprieve. Along with their petition, they had
filed a lawsuit asking the courts to turn the decision
over to the state's lieutenant governor, claiming they
didn't have a chance before tough-on-crime Davis.
A federal district judge and a panel of the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court rejected that attempt.
