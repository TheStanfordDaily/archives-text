BASE, (aiba (AP) — Defense Secre
tary Donald 11. Rumsfeld ruled out
yesterday any possibility of granting
prisoner of war status to the sus
pected terrorists held in a makeshift
prison on this U.S. Navy base.
" I hey are not POYVs. I "hey will
not be determined to be POWs,"
Rumsfeld told reporters accompa
nying him on his first visit to the
detention facility, a hot and dusty
camp amid scrub brush and rock.
fhe Bush administration con
siders the captured fighters to be
"unlawful combatants" and "de
tainees" rather than prisoners of
war because they don't represent a
recognized government and their
method of terror violates interna
tionally accepted laws of warfare.
The distinction is significant lie
cause under the Geneva Conven
tions, written after World War 11, a
POW has certain legal rights that
would govern the U.S. military's
interrogations of the detainees
and would require that tliev be re

leased when the hostilities in
Afghanistan are over.
If there is am ambiguity about
whether a captive should be con
sidered a prisoner of war, the
Geneva Conventions sav a special
three-person military tribunal
should be convened to decide.
Rumsfeld said that is irrele
vant at Guantanamo Bay.
" There is no ambiguity in this
case," he said.
Vice President Dick Cheney
said yesterday that officials agree
the detainees aren't prisoners of
war. But administration lawyers
are debating whether the Geneva
Conventions, which have provi
sions that deal with unlawful com
batants, apply in this case.
" I hese are the worst of a very
bad lot," Cheney told Fox News
Sunday. "'They are ver) danger
ous. They are devoted to killing
millions <>l Americans, innocent
Americans, il they can, and they
are perfectly prepared to die in
the effort."
