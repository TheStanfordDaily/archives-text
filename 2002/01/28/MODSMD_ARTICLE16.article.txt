## The 						Stanford Daily Walker deliberately endangered American lives 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )I

Last week, so-called "American Tal
iban" John Walker Lindh entered a
federal courtroom to stand trial
against charges that include con
spiracy to murder Americans abroad, pro
viding material, resources and support to
terrorist organizations. If convicted, Walk
er could face life in prison.
Walker's lawyers have sought to repre
sent him as a misguided young man who
found himself in the wrong place at the
wrong time. Walker's father, Frank Lindh,
has also jumped to Walker s defense, telling
interviewers that John loves America. . .
John did not do anything against America.

John did not take up arms against America.
He never meant to harm any American,
and he never did harm any American."
While the attempts on the part of Walk
er's lawyers and his father to defend him
are understandable, their claims are far
from the truth. Walker will not succeed by
attempting to play the babe in the woods
routine.
He was not kidnapped from his Marin
County home and conscripted by an armed
gang of Islamic fundamentalists. Instead,
Walker made the conscious choice to leave
Pakistan for Afghanistan and join the Tal
iban and the al-Qaeda terrorist network,

whose aims include the destruction of Unit
ed States institutions and citizens, domestic
and international, military and civilian.
At this point Walker crossed the line
from international traveler to internation
al criminal. True, Walker may not have had
prior knowledge of the Sept. 1 1 terrorist
attacks or other international terrorist
plots, but by fighting with a terrorist group
who had declared holy war on the United
States, he has supported terrorist organi
zations and threatened American lives.
Therefore, Walker should be criminally
prosecuted for his actions. Other details of
his personal life should remain irrelevant

in determining his criminal status.
Yes, he may be a misguided, troubled
young man who found Islam after strug
gling to cope with his difficult adolescence
and his parents' divorce. However, Walk
er's age and his circumstances should not
be mitigating factors in his trial.
John Walker Lindh is a pathetic figure
who made several terrible decisions that led
him to his current position — in federal
custody awaiting a Feb. 6 hearing and po
tential grand jury indictment. While we
may certainly feel sorry for him and for the
decisions he made, that pathos ought not
get in the way of the letter of the law.
