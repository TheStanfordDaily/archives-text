# THAT SIDE OF PARADISE
## It's fountainhud time 
### 
As Vice President Dick "MIA" Ch
eney scuttles around under the
radar and Enron's petrocrats fly
above ii in their celestial jets en
route to the shores of Fiji, casting over us
the shadow of capitalism's sinister side, I
think ii is st ill possible to carry on blissfully.
Alter all, it has been a good week: 1 fi
nally got a job (oh wait) and I found out
thai my arch nemesis has genital herpes.
Not much is rotten in the state of Cali
fornia other than the fact that this is the
last opinion column that I will write for

The Daily. And so for
days now, I have been
trying to figure out the
most immortal, inflam
matory and eccentric
subject on which to ex
pound. What to write
about in this last stand?
I he crass, coked cow
box who is moonlighting

as the president of the United States seems
too easy a target. Besides, Osama, pretzels
and that oh-so-nefarious Sen. Tom
l),is< hie seem to be keeping I)-l)ubya-I oc
cupied for the time being, so I suppose we
should cut him some slack.
But still: yesterday (INN reported that
the first anti-ballistic missile naval test was
a success, and I can't help but question
win our president insists on pursuing
anti-ballistic missile defense when even
Wolf Blit/cr knows that al Qaeda is plot
ting ,i nuclear/ dirty bomb attack on the
I nited Slates. I lie most hi-fi force field
in the universe won't prevent a rogue
nuke from being detonated on the
ground, so it would probably make more
sense to transfer the money that Bush is
investing in his cute fantasy to countert
errorist intelligence, radioactivity-detect
ing satellite technology and more strin
gent border security.
Next in my quest fora topic fora closing
column, I considered current affairs and
contemporary culture, but a cursory ex
amination reveals just one basic and un
surprising trend: a widespread American
aversion to being held accountable.
A few examples: hockey dad Thomas
Junta was sentenced to an appallingly le
nient sixto lOyears after murdering a man
half his size.
I he parents of John Walker Lindh,
jihad prom king, argue that son their
"loves America." Hmmmm. Replace
"loves" with "launched a holy war against."
hnron executives aren't rushing to take
up a collection plate and donate part of
their mammoth stock-optioned fortunes to
the thousands of employees who, because
they didn't get the memo that the S.S.
Knron had been cannonballed, lost their
entire pensions when Knron stock flopped.
Nor are the 19 out of 23 members of
Busbies energy committee (or for that
matter, the 71 senators) who received
Knron largesse sc rambling to return cam
paign funds. Nor are they scrambling to
reform c ampaign finance.
Indeed, in an effort to divorce himself
from Knrongate, Bush and his myopic
gaggle did nothing, so as not to hand
democrats the smoking gun. Arthur An

dersen, who was supposedly auditing the
very corporation 112 rom whit hit received lu
crative consulting fees, also stood by defer
entially while the temple burned.
In his song "Heart of the City," Jay-/
raps"l thought I told you characters I'm not
a rapper." No one seems willing to acknc>wl
edge who they are or what they have done.
Strangely enough, the liberation of capital
markets and global trade seems also to have
liberated us from responsibility and ac
countability. And so forth.
But enough of that, it's time to turn
the focus of this twilight dispatch to our
own palmy campus, where we all are still
accountable.
As a graduating senior, it is probably
time for some token introspection. But be
cause any severe rumination may prompt
premature nostalgia, I will be iorced to
keep my commentary succinct; and after
all, 1 do still have a few months left at this
lovely school.
Senior year is both remarkable and un
remarkable at the same time. I seem to be
at the top but am still no closer to the sun.
In the past lour years our social pastures
have expanded in girth and diversity but
have also become incestuous. Excluding
those who are content to be married to
their college mate, everyone else seems to
confuse friendship with all things carnal,
and the result is a tree of intimacy so
gnarled and delicate that it's laughable. II
this doesn't seem possible to you, just wait.
For better or lor worse, visceral whims se
duce all of us, and they will disrupt your
four years of effort at neatly congealing
your social spheres.
Regarding change: Stanford's so< ial
mores and its consequent strictures defi
nitely evolve over the course ol four years,
though I am skeptical of anyone who de
dares themselves very different at the end.
Ihe kids who sauntered around your
freshman dorm with hackneyed declara
tions and a defiant lack of social grace or
sturdy character will, as seniors, probably
feel as though their scxial institution or
Creek affiliation validates them, but they
are, in essence, the same person. Oscar
Wilde wrote that nothing that is worth
knowing can be taught. Social adroitness,
virtue of virtues, c an be observed and ad
mired and even emulated, but after a cer
tain age it is as innate as the- manic climate
of northern California.
The goblins and rock stars and loqua
cious misanthropes of freshman year are
the same gcjblins and rock stars and loqua
cious misanthropes senior year. Metamor
phosis is contrived and rare, and redemp
tion even rarer.
In his'song "Eiving it Up," Ja Rule
mewls "You think I got time to do fâ€” all
these hos and do all these shows?" No, of
course that would be way too much to ask.
I .ike (a Rule, we are all overreachers with
not enough time, but nevertheless,
throughout the past couple of months,
there has been time to resolve one persis
tent emotion.
The sensation that seems to Ik- loitering
at the doorstep of my daily demeanor is
