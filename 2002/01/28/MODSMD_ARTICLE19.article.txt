Lice article 'ignores broader issues'
I lie article "When Lire Attack" by Anna
(ialen, published in last Friday's Daily, was
shamefully simplistic and myopic on several
levels .is it failed to recognize and examine
the broader issues of homelessness in the
I'alo Alto area.
First, the way in which the article was
framed set a sensationalists tone. File head
er states "Vagrant trespasses in Branner
and Cedro, leaving residents wondering
what to do. . .When Lice Attack." Students
are not left wondering why this woman, 01
hundreds like her, are homeless in the gold
mine of Silicon Valley. I lie article lodises
on how the poor Stanford students had
their "false sense of security" shattered. It
fails to mention how many homeless people
in our area have no sense of security at all.
Second, the picture in the article of an
enormous louse descending on pristine
Branner, perpetuates the degrading stereo
types that equate homeless people with un
clean alien intruders. The picture was used
as a dramatic tool at the expense of dehu
manizing a person in trouble.
Third, we found it a huge journalistic
error to assume that the lice cases that were
found in Branner (after the hoards of pan
icked students flocked to (Lowell) originated
from the woman. Lice are a common prob
lem in even the most sterile of living condi
tions, so it isn't surprising that a few cases
were found in a dorm of hundreds of stu
dents just back from vac ation.
Lice, in the grand scheme of social con
c cms, are not a big deal. I lomelessnessand
mental illness are. We realize that the Daily's
job is to report the events in student life and
not necessarily to promote a social agenda.
I lowever, this does not mean that it should
perpetuate a < lassist mentality and ignore
the broader issues that exist in our sur
rounding communities.

Gaudet letter 'succeeded'
" Fo criticize your own school is to pay
it .1 compliment and render it a service."
Senator J. William Fulbright would have
excused this paraphrase had he read
Rob (iaudet's column last week ("The
(iaudet Doctrine").
l'lie fuming letters it elicited simply
confirmed its success. I lard to admit, but
the purpose of a Daily column is not to
unite us. We have the "Founders Day"
speeches (and free lunch!) for that func
tion. A column should divide us. But it
should do so on what is essential and of
consequence; on t he right issues, not on
the issues of the right.
In such a column, only two questions
matter: whether the writer selects an ap
propriate target and whether he attacks it
with accuracy and responsibility. I think
(iaudet has succeeded in both: the moral
impoverishment of Law schools, the cult
of grades, the need for adequate tempera
ture levels in student residences, U.S.
recognition of the International Court of
Justice. I liese are indeed crucial matters.
As for responsibility, hardly any of his
claims arrives without justification, be it
statistical evidence, citations, interviews or
ac tual incidents. And his follow-up letters
evince a healthy commitment to the read
ers he writes for.
As ,i columnist in a prestigious student
publication, Gaudet understands the
power he is invested with. He holds the
sword of public scrutiny. He can either
strike or stroke. I le can attack the dragon
or spread comforting butter over our bi
ases. It says a lot about his character that
he- has chosen the fiery way.
Fmbarrassing as it may be for many,
(iaudet's inside knowledge confirms long
held perceptions about the legal profes
sion. Who can deny that lawyers have
been the most reviled profession through
out history, across national borders and
beyond cultural differences? That this
view is still alive today raises questions
about the quality of law education.
No doubt, there are admirable law stu
dents with altruistic inclinations and phi
lanthropic ac tivities as much as there are
humane wardens in death camps. The

point here is not individuals but struc
tures. We live in the most conservative of
all societies. For anything wrong we de
mand change of faces but never change of
structure. And it is the structural deficien
cies ol the law school education that
Gaudet attacks: the irrelevance of ex
tracurricular activities; the irreverance ol
moral concerns; the conception of the
lawyer as a manipulator rather than a ser
vant of the law; and the acceptance of
legal knowledge and experience as a
value-free commodity offered to the high
est bid.
Implicitly, Gaudet also touches on the
incompatibility of professional schools with
institutions of higher learning, their values
being at cross-purposes with those of a lib
eral ( = liberating) university education.
Above all. Gaudet reminds us that
there is no high-power environment
without its log of self-perpetuating illu
sion. 1 lie stakes being so high, everybody
programs herself to meet what she per
ceives as everybody else's expectations.
()ne is sad to realize that behind imposing
structures and polished facades there are
caves replete with shadows chasing one
another in fear and lust.
By striving to escape from the laundry
of institutional acclimatization, Gaudet
treads the noble path of creative resis
tance, the one Senator Fulbright had in
mind. Even if he cannot pay a compli
ment to his school, we should be grateful
to him for at least rendering it a service.

Attacks on Gaudet 'beneath contempt'
This is in response to the intemperate
and vicious attacks launched on Gaudet
by a few members of the law school. I lav
ing spent only a few months at the law
school doing research, I would not have
speculated about the moral character of
its members, but having read the four
letters published last week, I cannot help
but see that Gaudet's point is well taken.
VV bile it is clear that these people do not
know how to disagree without being dis
agreeable, i hey also seem to have forgot
ten that it is possible to destroy an argu
ment without attempting to destroy the
person making it.in fact, in their at
tempts at destroying Gaudet, they look
like the pyromaniac who set lire to his
own house!
I heir personal attacks on Gaudet are
beneath contempt. I would ordinarily
not have dignified il with a response but
lor the dangerous attempt at portraying
Gaudet as an isolated voice. Having
known Gaudet from his days at Oxford,
1 can testify to the fact that he is any
thing but a loner. He lias had.a positive
impact on everything that he has at
tempted, and is by far the best of The
Daily's columnists.
The attackers seem to think that they
can weaken Gaudet's arguments with a
combination of innuendo, distortions and
plain lies. One writer suggests that Gaudet
accused him and his ilk of being Sodomites.
While I have no knowledge of or inter
est in his sexual preferences, even the
most minute examination of Gaudet's ar
ticle failed to suggest anything of the sort.
As ii this was not enough, he selectively
quotes from Gaudet's other articles,
naively believing that selective quotation
will destroy (iaudet's credibility.
I wo of the letter writers have the temer
ity to lecture the editors of The Daily. While
I may have a vested interest in defending
I he I )aily (being a contributor), may 1 sug
gest that the editors put the advice and the
letters in the rubbish bin, where it belongs.

Gaudet responds to letters
The letters written by Ryan Spiegel,
David Annillei, Jennifer Catherine and
()/ge (iu/elsu are filled with lies, mis
conceptions, ad horninem attacks and
distortions of the truth. I hey have not
addressed the substantive merits of
"The (iaudet Doctrine." Instead, they
have confirmed my argument that
i here is a lack of civility among students
in law school.
There was no "defamation" in my por
trayal of the law school experience.
"Defamation" requires the making of an

untrue statement about a public figure.
My column did not name any public fig
ures. Furthermore, the column truthful
ly stated my personal experience. It is a
fact that fewer than 20 percent ol law stu
dents participate in any kind of public in
terest work. It is a fact that less than one
percent ol billable time in large corporate
firm is spent on pro bono cases.
I lie "Gaudet Doctrine" is my hand
book for survival within this environment.
Many of my peers have told me that tlie\
wholeheartedly agree with my observa
tions. Despite the obstacles, I have en
joyed the challenge of law school. Most ol
the professors are wonderful, kind-heart
ed, intelligent people Our school's repu
tation opens all kinds of doors. In addi
tion, I have developed warm and lasting
friendships with kindred souls in the law
school and other parts of the University.
Spiegel says "some students are forced
to go to large corporate law firms, because
they cannot otherwise afford to pay back
their student loans." I hat's incorrect. The
Stanford Loan Repayment Assistance Pro
gram (LRAP) pays off the loans of any stu
dent who works in the public interest and
earns below a certain salary. Fven without
LRAP, lawyers can do what they enjoy and
still earn a living.
1 have been accused of misogyny on
the basis of an "offensive implication that
female law students shopping for vibra
tors are somehow immoral." People are
entitled to shop for whatever the\ want.
It's up to them. My peeve is with Robert
Byrnes for his tasteless admission of pri
vate sexual conduct with multiple part
ners in a law school dorm. My previous
column ("Ideological Resolutions," |an.
9) said we should work hard to increase
the number of female legislators in this
country. We have fallen behind the Scan
dinavian countries.
(iuzelsu said I have "insecurity with [my]
own sexuality." We have never spoken
about sexual topics of any kind. I here is ab
solutely no basis for her deranged and
mean-spirited remarks. Guzelsu should
leave armchair analysis on the collee table
where it belongs.
Spiegel maliciously quotes a law linn
that accused me of misrepresenting mv
C «PA. This is a deliberate distortion ol the
truth. My previous column ("Cult of the
CPA," Oct. 24) tells the full story of how I
sent a fax pointing out the error myself as
soon as I received my academic transcript.
Two weeks later, the firm acc used me of
misrepresenting my GPA despite the fact
that 1 had brought it to their attention.
The mistake was a mere 0.2 of a point.

I his fixation by two letter- writers con
linns my argument in "Cult of the GPA."

Israeli-Palestinian historical perspective
I would like to correct some factual
errors that appeared in Omar Mesar
wi's Idler to the editor on (an. 23rd. I
would like to stress that I did not attend
Dr. Brook's lecture and I don't know
what he said. By no means do 1 defend
what he allegedly said.
1. Flic right of the Jewish people on
ilie- land ol Israel is based on the fact
that the Jewish people was expelled by
force from the land of Israel by the
Roman Fmpire around 70 AD. This
happened after more than 1,000 years
of statehood. Any individual that settled
(or "bought" a plot of land) in the land
ol Israel after that date did in fact settle
on "stolen land."
Nevertheless, the Zionist organiza
tions did "buy back" large portions of
what is known as pre-1967 Israel and
also some land of w hat is known today
as the "territories" notably in East
Jerusalem, Gush Fzion and in the Jor
dan Valley. Most Palestinians living
today in the land of Israel arrived to the
land in the last 1 .">() years. 1 n I his respect
the Jews are truly the "Native Ameri
cans'' of the land of Israel.
2. One should not confuse between Is
raeli-Arabs also known as Israeli-Palestini

an Arabs who are citizens of the State of Is
rael and between Palestinians living in the
territories. Arab Israelis are In and large
equal citizens in Israel, enjoying the free
dom of thought and expression and
equally important the light to vote to the
parliament. Unfortunately this can not be
said on the citizens of any of the Arab di< -
tatorships including ihe Palestinian Au
thority. Palestinian in the some parts of
the territories do indeed live under a mil
itary occupation. I he territories were oc
cupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in
1 ( J(')7, a war that Israel did not start. Only
recently did an Israeli prime minister
offer the Palestinians a state on most of the
territories. The Palestinian leaders reject
ed the offer.
Most Palestinians have never really
recognized Israel's light to exist. Maybe
they should not be held guilty for that:
many Palestinians are not familiar with
the fact that the land they live on used to
be the Jewish homeland thousands of
years ago. Ihe problem is that nowhere
in the Arab world can one find reliable
information. Ihe Arab dictatorships
(the Palestinian Authority included)
spread disinformation in order to stabi
lize their corrupt regimes. I think Arab-
Americans can play a vital role in the
peace process between Israel and tin-
Aral) countries.
Arab-Americans have access to reli
able sources of information. Arab-Amer
icans can advocate democracy in the
Arab world. Arab-Americans can help
Palestinians understand why genuinely
recognizing the right of Israel to exist
will enable a Palestinian state to exist.

Gaudet letter 'succeeded'
" Fo criticize your own school is to pay
it .1 compliment and render it a service."
Senator J. William Fulbright would have
excused this paraphrase had he read
Rob (iaudet's column last week ("The
(iaudet Doctrine").
l'lie fuming letters it elicited simply
confirmed its success. I lard to admit, but
the purpose of a Daily column is not to
unite us. We have the "Founders Day"
speeches (and free lunch!) for that func
tion. A column should divide us. But it
should do so on what is essential and of
consequence; on t he right issues, not on
the issues of the right.
In such a column, only two questions
matter: whether the writer selects an ap
propriate target and whether he attacks it
with accuracy and responsibility. I think
(iaudet has succeeded in both: the moral
impoverishment of Law schools, the cult
of grades, the need for adequate tempera
ture levels in student residences, U.S.
recognition of the International Court of
Justice. I liese are indeed crucial matters.
As for responsibility, hardly any of his
claims arrives without justification, be it
statistical evidence, citations, interviews or
ac tual incidents. And his follow-up letters
evince a healthy commitment to the read
ers he writes for.
As ,i columnist in a prestigious student
publication, Gaudet understands the
power he is invested with. He holds the
sword of public scrutiny. He can either
strike or stroke. I le can attack the dragon
or spread comforting butter over our bi
ases. It says a lot about his character that
he- has chosen the fiery way.
Fmbarrassing as it may be for many,
(iaudet's inside knowledge confirms long
held perceptions about the legal profes
sion. Who can deny that lawyers have
been the most reviled profession through
out history, across national borders and
beyond cultural differences? That this
view is still alive today raises questions
about the quality of law education.
No doubt, there are admirable law stu
dents with altruistic inclinations and phi
lanthropic ac tivities as much as there are
humane wardens in death camps. The

point here is not individuals but struc
tures. We live in the most conservative of
all societies. For anything wrong we de
mand change of faces but never change of
structure. And it is the structural deficien
cies ol the law school education that
Gaudet attacks: the irrelevance of ex
tracurricular activities; the irreverance ol
moral concerns; the conception of the
lawyer as a manipulator rather than a ser
vant of the law; and the acceptance of
legal knowledge and experience as a
value-free commodity offered to the high
est bid.
Implicitly, Gaudet also touches on the
incompatibility of professional schools with
institutions of higher learning, their values
being at cross-purposes with those of a lib
eral ( = liberating) university education.
Above all. Gaudet reminds us that
there is no high-power environment
without its log of self-perpetuating illu
sion. 1 lie stakes being so high, everybody
programs herself to meet what she per
ceives as everybody else's expectations.
()ne is sad to realize that behind imposing
structures and polished facades there are
caves replete with shadows chasing one
another in fear and lust.
By striving to escape from the laundry
of institutional acclimatization, Gaudet
treads the noble path of creative resis
tance, the one Senator Fulbright had in
mind. Even if he cannot pay a compli
ment to his school, we should be grateful
to him for at least rendering it a service.

Attacks on Gaudet 'beneath contempt'
This is in response to the intemperate
and vicious attacks launched on Gaudet
by a few members of the law school. I lav
ing spent only a few months at the law
school doing research, I would not have
speculated about the moral character of
its members, but having read the four
letters published last week, I cannot help
but see that Gaudet's point is well taken.
VV bile it is clear that these people do not
know how to disagree without being dis
agreeable, i hey also seem to have forgot
ten that it is possible to destroy an argu
ment without attempting to destroy the
person making it.in fact, in their at
tempts at destroying Gaudet, they look
like the pyromaniac who set lire to his
own house!
I heir personal attacks on Gaudet are
beneath contempt. I would ordinarily
not have dignified il with a response but
lor the dangerous attempt at portraying
Gaudet as an isolated voice. Having
known Gaudet from his days at Oxford,
1 can testify to the fact that he is any
thing but a loner. He lias had.a positive
impact on everything that he has at
tempted, and is by far the best of The
Daily's columnists.
The attackers seem to think that they
can weaken Gaudet's arguments with a
combination of innuendo, distortions and
plain lies. One writer suggests that Gaudet
accused him and his ilk of being Sodomites.
While I have no knowledge of or inter
est in his sexual preferences, even the
most minute examination of Gaudet's ar
ticle failed to suggest anything of the sort.
As ii this was not enough, he selectively
quotes from Gaudet's other articles,
naively believing that selective quotation
will destroy (iaudet's credibility.

Gaudet responds to letters
The letters written by Ryan Spiegel,

conceptions, ad horninem attacks and
distortions of the truth. I hey have not
addressed the substantive merits of
"The (iaudet Doctrine." Instead, they
have confirmed my argument that
i here is a lack of civility among students

There was no "defamation" in my por

"Defamation" requires the making of an

untrue statement about a public figure.
My column did not name any public fig
ures. Furthermore, the column truthful

Dr. Brook's lecture and I don't know
what he said. By no means do 1 defend
what he allegedly said.
1. Flic right of the Jewish people on
ilie- land ol Israel is based on the fact
that the Jewish people was expelled by
force from the land of Israel by the
Roman Fmpire around 70 AD. This
happened after more than 1,000 years
of statehood. Any individual that settled
(or "bought" a plot of land) in the land
ol Israel after that date did in fact settle
on "stolen land."
Nevertheless, the Zionist organiza
tions did "buy back" large portions of
what is known as pre-1967 Israel and
also some land of w hat is known today
as the "territories" notably in East
Jerusalem, Gush Fzion and in the Jor
dan Valley. Most Palestinians living
today in the land of Israel arrived to the
land in the last 1 .">() years. 1 n I his respect

cans'' of the land of Israel.
2. One should not confuse between Is

an Arabs who are citizens of the State of Is
rael and between Palestinians living in the
territories. Arab Israelis are In and large
equal citizens in Israel, enjoying the free

equally important the light to vote to the

said on the citizens of any of the Arab di< -

cupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in
1 ( J(')7, a war that Israel did not start. Only
recently did an Israeli prime minister
offer the Palestinians a state on most of the
territories. The Palestinian leaders reject
ed the offer.
Most Palestinians have never really
recognized Israel's light to exist. Maybe
they should not be held guilty for that:
many Palestinians are not familiar with
the fact that the land they live on used to
be the Jewish homeland thousands of

Gaudet letter 'succeeded'
" Fo criticize your own school is to pay
it .1 compliment and render it a service."
Senator J. William Fulbright would have
excused this paraphrase had he read
Rob (iaudet's column last week ("The
(iaudet Doctrine").
l'lie fuming letters it elicited simply
confirmed its success. I lard to admit, but
the purpose of a Daily column is not to
unite us. We have the "Founders Day"
speeches (and free lunch!) for that func
tion. A column should divide us. But it
should do so on what is essential and of
consequence; on t he right issues, not on
the issues of the right.
In such a column, only two questions
matter: whether the writer selects an ap
propriate target and whether he attacks it
with accuracy and responsibility. I think
(iaudet has succeeded in both: the moral
impoverishment of Law schools, the cult
of grades, the need for adequate tempera
ture levels in student residences, U.S.
recognition of the International Court of
Justice. I liese are indeed crucial matters.
As for responsibility, hardly any of his
claims arrives without justification, be it
statistical evidence, citations, interviews or
ac tual incidents. And his follow-up letters
evince a healthy commitment to the read
ers he writes for.
As ,i columnist in a prestigious student
publication, Gaudet understands the
power he is invested with. He holds the
sword of public scrutiny. He can either
strike or stroke. I le can attack the dragon
or spread comforting butter over our bi
ases. It says a lot about his character that
he- has chosen the fiery way.
Fmbarrassing as it may be for many,
(iaudet's inside knowledge confirms long
held perceptions about the legal profes
sion. Who can deny that lawyers have
been the most reviled profession through
out history, across national borders and
beyond cultural differences? That this
view is still alive today raises questions
about the quality of law education.
No doubt, there are admirable law stu
dents with altruistic inclinations and phi
lanthropic ac tivities as much as there are
humane wardens in death camps. The

point here is not individuals but struc
tures. We live in the most conservative of
all societies. For anything wrong we de
mand change of faces but never change of
structure. And it is the structural deficien
cies ol the law school education that
Gaudet attacks: the irrelevance of ex
tracurricular activities; the irreverance ol
moral concerns; the conception of the
lawyer as a manipulator rather than a ser
vant of the law; and the acceptance of
legal knowledge and experience as a
value-free commodity offered to the high
est bid.
Implicitly, Gaudet also touches on the
incompatibility of professional schools with
institutions of higher learning, their values
being at cross-purposes with those of a lib
eral ( = liberating) university education.
Above all. Gaudet reminds us that
there is no high-power environment
without its log of self-perpetuating illu
sion. 1 lie stakes being so high, everybody
programs herself to meet what she per
ceives as everybody else's expectations.
()ne is sad to realize that behind imposing
structures and polished facades there are
caves replete with shadows chasing one
another in fear and lust.
By striving to escape from the laundry
of institutional acclimatization, Gaudet
treads the noble path of creative resis
tance, the one Senator Fulbright had in
mind. Even if he cannot pay a compli
ment to his school, we should be grateful
to him for at least rendering it a service.

Attacks on Gaudet 'beneath contempt'
This is in response to the intemperate
and vicious attacks launched on Gaudet
by a few members of the law school. I lav
ing spent only a few months at the law
school doing research, I would not have
speculated about the moral character of
its members, but having read the four
letters published last week, I cannot help
but see that Gaudet's point is well taken.
VV bile it is clear that these people do not
know how to disagree without being dis
agreeable, i hey also seem to have forgot
ten that it is possible to destroy an argu
ment without attempting to destroy the
person making it.in fact, in their at
tempts at destroying Gaudet, they look
like the pyromaniac who set lire to his
own house!
I heir personal attacks on Gaudet are
beneath contempt. I would ordinarily
not have dignified il with a response but
lor the dangerous attempt at portraying
Gaudet as an isolated voice. Having
known Gaudet from his days at Oxford,
1 can testify to the fact that he is any
thing but a loner. He lias had.a positive
impact on everything that he has at
tempted, and is by far the best of The
Daily's columnists.
The attackers seem to think that they
can weaken Gaudet's arguments with a
combination of innuendo, distortions and
plain lies. One writer suggests that Gaudet
accused him and his ilk of being Sodomites.
While I have no knowledge of or inter
est in his sexual preferences, even the
most minute examination of Gaudet's ar
ticle failed to suggest anything of the sort.
As ii this was not enough, he selectively
quotes from Gaudet's other articles,
naively believing that selective quotation
will destroy (iaudet's credibility.

The letters written by Ryan Spiegel,

distortions of the truth. I hey have not
addressed the substantive merits of

would like to stress that I did not attend
Dr. Brook's lecture and I don't know
what he said. By no means do 1 defend
what he allegedly said.
1. Flic right of the Jewish people on
ilie- land ol Israel is based on the fact
that the Jewish people was expelled by
force from the land of Israel by the
Roman Fmpire around 70 AD. This
happened after more than 1,000 years
of statehood. Any individual that settled
(or "bought" a plot of land) in the land
ol Israel after that date did in fact settle
on "stolen land."
Nevertheless, the Zionist organiza
tions did "buy back" large portions of
what is known as pre-1967 Israel and
also some land of w hat is known today
as the "territories" notably in East
Jerusalem, Gush Fzion and in the Jor
dan Valley. Most Palestinians living
today in the land of Israel arrived to the
land in the last 1 .">() years. 1 n I his respect
the Jews are truly the "Native Ameri
cans'' of the land of Israel.
2. One should not confuse between Is
raeli-Arabs also known as Israeli-Palestini

an Arabs who are citizens of the State of Is
rael and between Palestinians living in the
territories. Arab Israelis are In and large
equal citizens in Israel, enjoying the free

equally important the light to vote to the
parliament. Unfortunately this can not be
said on the citizens of any of the Arab di< -
tatorships including ihe Palestinian Au

cupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in
1 ( J(')7, a war that Israel did not start. Only
recently did an Israeli prime minister
offer the Palestinians a state on most of the
territories. The Palestinian leaders reject
ed the offer.
Most Palestinians have never really
recognized Israel's light to exist. Maybe
they should not be held guilty for that:
many Palestinians are not familiar with
the fact that the land they live on used to
be the Jewish homeland thousands of
years ago. Ihe problem is that nowhere

Arab-Americans have access to reli

Gaudet letter 'succeeded'
" Fo criticize your own school is to pay
it .1 compliment and render it a service."
Senator J. William Fulbright would have
excused this paraphrase had he read
Rob (iaudet's column last week ("The
(iaudet Doctrine").
l'lie fuming letters it elicited simply
confirmed its success. I lard to admit, but
the purpose of a Daily column is not to
unite us. We have the "Founders Day"
speeches (and free lunch!) for that func
tion. A column should divide us. But it
should do so on what is essential and of
consequence; on t he right issues, not on
the issues of the right.
In such a column, only two questions
matter: whether the writer selects an ap
propriate target and whether he attacks it
with accuracy and responsibility. I think
(iaudet has succeeded in both: the moral
impoverishment of Law schools, the cult
of grades, the need for adequate tempera
ture levels in student residences, U.S.
recognition of the International Court of
Justice. I liese are indeed crucial matters.
As for responsibility, hardly any of his
claims arrives without justification, be it
statistical evidence, citations, interviews or
ac tual incidents. And his follow-up letters
evince a healthy commitment to the read
ers he writes for.
As ,i columnist in a prestigious student
publication, Gaudet understands the
power he is invested with. He holds the
sword of public scrutiny. He can either
strike or stroke. I le can attack the dragon
or spread comforting butter over our bi
ases. It says a lot about his character that
he- has chosen the fiery way.
Fmbarrassing as it may be for many,
(iaudet's inside knowledge confirms long
held perceptions about the legal profes
sion. Who can deny that lawyers have
been the most reviled profession through
out history, across national borders and
beyond cultural differences? That this
view is still alive today raises questions
about the quality of law education.
No doubt, there are admirable law stu
dents with altruistic inclinations and phi
lanthropic ac tivities as much as there are
humane wardens in death camps. The

point here is not individuals but struc
tures. We live in the most conservative of
all societies. For anything wrong we de
mand change of faces but never change of
structure. And it is the structural deficien
cies ol the law school education that
Gaudet attacks: the irrelevance of ex
tracurricular activities; the irreverance ol
moral concerns; the conception of the
lawyer as a manipulator rather than a ser
vant of the law; and the acceptance of
legal knowledge and experience as a
value-free commodity offered to the high
est bid.
Implicitly, Gaudet also touches on the
incompatibility of professional schools with
institutions of higher learning, their values
being at cross-purposes with those of a lib
eral ( = liberating) university education.
Above all. Gaudet reminds us that
there is no high-power environment
without its log of self-perpetuating illu
sion. 1 lie stakes being so high, everybody
programs herself to meet what she per
ceives as everybody else's expectations.
()ne is sad to realize that behind imposing
structures and polished facades there are
caves replete with shadows chasing one
another in fear and lust.
By striving to escape from the laundry
of institutional acclimatization, Gaudet
treads the noble path of creative resis
tance, the one Senator Fulbright had in
mind. Even if he cannot pay a compli
ment to his school, we should be grateful
to him for at least rendering it a service.

Attacks on Gaudet 'beneath contempt'
This is in response to the intemperate
and vicious attacks launched on Gaudet
by a few members of the law school. I lav
ing spent only a few months at the law
school doing research, I would not have
speculated about the moral character of
its members, but having read the four
letters published last week, I cannot help
but see that Gaudet's point is well taken.
VV bile it is clear that these people do not
know how to disagree without being dis
agreeable, i hey also seem to have forgot
ten that it is possible to destroy an argu
ment without attempting to destroy the
person making it.in fact, in their at
tempts at destroying Gaudet, they look
like the pyromaniac who set lire to his
own house!
I heir personal attacks on Gaudet are
beneath contempt. I would ordinarily
not have dignified il with a response but
lor the dangerous attempt at portraying
Gaudet as an isolated voice. Having
known Gaudet from his days at Oxford,
1 can testify to the fact that he is any
thing but a loner. He lias had.a positive
impact on everything that he has at
tempted, and is by far the best of The
Daily's columnists.
The attackers seem to think that they
can weaken Gaudet's arguments with a
combination of innuendo, distortions and
plain lies. One writer suggests that Gaudet
accused him and his ilk of being Sodomites.
While I have no knowledge of or inter
est in his sexual preferences, even the
most minute examination of Gaudet's ar
ticle failed to suggest anything of the sort.
As ii this was not enough, he selectively
quotes from Gaudet's other articles,
naively believing that selective quotation
will destroy (iaudet's credibility.

The letters written by Ryan Spiegel,

conceptions, ad horninem attacks and
distortions of the truth. I hey have not
addressed the substantive merits of
"The (iaudet Doctrine." Instead, they
have confirmed my argument that
i here is a lack of civility among students

There was no "defamation" in my por

"Defamation" requires the making of an

untrue statement about a public figure.
My column did not name any public fig
ures. Furthermore, the column truthful

I would like to correct some factual
errors that appeared in Omar Mesar
wi's Idler to the editor on (an. 23rd. I
would like to stress that I did not attend
Dr. Brook's lecture and I don't know
what he said. By no means do 1 defend
what he allegedly said.
1. Flic right of the Jewish people on
ilie- land ol Israel is based on the fact
that the Jewish people was expelled by
force from the land of Israel by the
Roman Fmpire around 70 AD. This
happened after more than 1,000 years
of statehood. Any individual that settled
(or "bought" a plot of land) in the land
ol Israel after that date did in fact settle
on "stolen land."
Nevertheless, the Zionist organiza
tions did "buy back" large portions of
what is known as pre-1967 Israel and
also some land of w hat is known today
as the "territories" notably in East
Jerusalem, Gush Fzion and in the Jor
dan Valley. Most Palestinians living
today in the land of Israel arrived to the
land in the last 1 .">() years. 1 n I his respect
the Jews are truly the "Native Ameri
cans'' of the land of Israel.
2. One should not confuse between Is
raeli-Arabs also known as Israeli-Palestini

an Arabs who are citizens of the State of Is
rael and between Palestinians living in the
territories. Arab Israelis are In and large
equal citizens in Israel, enjoying the free
dom of thought and expression and
equally important the light to vote to the
parliament. Unfortunately this can not be
said on the citizens of any of the Arab di< -
tatorships including ihe Palestinian Au
thority. Palestinian in the some parts of
the territories do indeed live under a mil
itary occupation. I he territories were oc
cupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in
1 ( J(')7, a war that Israel did not start. Only
recently did an Israeli prime minister
offer the Palestinians a state on most of the
territories. The Palestinian leaders reject
ed the offer.
Most Palestinians have never really
recognized Israel's light to exist. Maybe
they should not be held guilty for that:
many Palestinians are not familiar with
the fact that the land they live on used to
be the Jewish homeland thousands of
years ago. Ihe problem is that nowhere
in the Arab world can one find reliable
information. Ihe Arab dictatorships
(the Palestinian Authority included)
spread disinformation in order to stabi
lize their corrupt regimes. I think Arab-
Americans can play a vital role in the
peace process between Israel and tin-
Aral) countries.
Arab-Americans have access to reli
able sources of information. Arab-Amer
icans can advocate democracy in the
Arab world. Arab-Americans can help
Palestinians understand why genuinely

Americans can play a vital role in the
peace process between Israel and tin-
Aral) countries.
Arab-Americans have access to reli
able sources of information. Arab-Amer
icans can advocate democracy in the
Arab world. Arab-Americans can help
Palestinians understand why genuinely
recognizing the right of Israel to exist

SIC article error corrected
I was misrepresented in Friday's
Daily in the story about Student Initiat
ed Courses. While I did make a state
ment to the effect that "modern philos
ophy and objectivism are diametrically
opposed," that was not my explanation
for why my course was not being spon
sored by the philosophy department,
which is what the article implies.
In fact, I only asked two members of the
philosophy department to consider
sponsoring my course and there were a
variety of reasons they chose not to do
so that were not ideological.
