Lice article 'ignores broader issues'
I lie article "When Lire Attack" by Anna
(ialen, published in last Friday's Daily, was
shamefully simplistic and myopic on several
levels .is it failed to recognize and examine
the broader issues of homelessness in the
I'alo Alto area.
First, the way in which the article was
framed set a sensationalists tone. File head
er states "Vagrant trespasses in Branner
and Cedro, leaving residents wondering
what to do. . .When Lice Attack." Students
are not left wondering why this woman, 01
hundreds like her, are homeless in the gold
mine of Silicon Valley. I lie article lodises
on how the poor Stanford students had
their "false sense of security" shattered. It
fails to mention how many homeless people
in our area have no sense of security at all.
Second, the picture in the article of an
enormous louse descending on pristine
Branner, perpetuates the degrading stereo
types that equate homeless people with un
clean alien intruders. The picture was used
as a dramatic tool at the expense of dehu
manizing a person in trouble.
Third, we found it a huge journalistic
error to assume that the lice cases that were
found in Branner (after the hoards of pan
icked students flocked to (Lowell) originated
from the woman. Lice are a common prob
lem in even the most sterile of living condi
tions, so it isn't surprising that a few cases
were found in a dorm of hundreds of stu
dents just back from vac ation.
Lice, in the grand scheme of social con
c cms, are not a big deal. I lomelessnessand
mental illness are. We realize that the Daily's
job is to report the events in student life and
not necessarily to promote a social agenda.
I lowever, this does not mean that it should
perpetuate a < lassist mentality and ignore
the broader issues that exist in our sur
rounding communities.
If readers are interested in learning
more about issues of homelessness and
urban development, contact Nina

Gaudet letter 'succeeded'
" Fo criticize your own school is to pay
it .1 compliment and render it a service."
Senator J. William Fulbright would have
excused this paraphrase had he read
Rob (iaudet's column last week ("The
(iaudet Doctrine").
l'lie fuming letters it elicited simply
confirmed its success. I lard to admit, but
the purpose of a Daily column is not to
unite us. We have the "Founders Day"
speeches (and free lunch!) for that func
tion. A column should divide us. But it
should do so on what is essential and of
consequence; on t he right issues, not on
the issues of the right.
In such a column, only two questions
matter: whether the writer selects an ap
propriate target and whether he attacks it
with accuracy and responsibility. I think
(iaudet has succeeded in both: the moral
impoverishment of Law schools, the cult
of grades, the need for adequate tempera
ture levels in student residences, U.S.
recognition of the International Court of
Justice. I liese are indeed crucial matters.
As for responsibility, hardly any of his
claims arrives without justification, be it
statistical evidence, citations, interviews or
ac tual incidents. And his follow-up letters
evince a healthy commitment to the read
ers he writes for.
As ,i columnist in a prestigious student
publication, Gaudet understands the
power he is invested with. He holds the
sword of public scrutiny. He can either
strike or stroke. I le can attack the dragon
or spread comforting butter over our bi
ases. It says a lot about his character that
he- has chosen the fiery way.
Fmbarrassing as it may be for many,
(iaudet's inside knowledge confirms long
held perceptions about the legal profes
sion. Who can deny that lawyers have
been the most reviled profession through
out history, across national borders and
beyond cultural differences? That this
view is still alive today raises questions
about the quality of law education.
No doubt, there are admirable law stu
dents with altruistic inclinations and phi
lanthropic ac tivities as much as there are
humane wardens in death camps. The

point here is not individuals but struc
tures. We live in the most conservative of
all societies. For anything wrong we de
mand change of faces but never change of
structure. And it is the structural deficien
cies ol the law school education that
Gaudet attacks: the irrelevance of ex
tracurricular activities; the irreverance ol
moral concerns; the conception of the
lawyer as a manipulator rather than a ser
vant of the law; and the acceptance of
legal knowledge and experience as a
value-free commodity offered to the high
est bid.
Implicitly, Gaudet also touches on the
incompatibility of professional schools with
institutions of higher learning, their values
being at cross-purposes with those of a lib
eral ( = liberating) university education.
Above all. Gaudet reminds us that
there is no high-power environment
without its log of self-perpetuating illu
sion. 1 lie stakes being so high, everybody
programs herself to meet what she per
ceives as everybody else's expectations.
()ne is sad to realize that behind imposing
structures and polished facades there are
caves replete with shadows chasing one
another in fear and lust.
By striving to escape from the laundry
of institutional acclimatization, Gaudet
treads the noble path of creative resis
tance, the one Senator Fulbright had in
mind. Even if he cannot pay a compli
ment to his school, we should be grateful
to him for at least rendering it a service.

Attacks on Gaudet 'beneath contempt'
This is in response to the intemperate
and vicious attacks launched on Gaudet
by a few members of the law school. I lav
ing spent only a few months at the law
school doing research, I would not have
speculated about the moral character of
its members, but having read the four
letters published last week, I cannot help
but see that Gaudet's point is well taken.
VV bile it is clear that these people do not
