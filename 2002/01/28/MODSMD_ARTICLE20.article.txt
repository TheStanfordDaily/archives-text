# Cheney defends Bush's refusal
## Vice President backs President's , choice not to name executives behind the administration's energy plan 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Dick
(Iheney yesterday defended President Bush's right
to refuse to identify the executives the White 1 louse
met with in formulating the administration's ener
gy policy.
Amid the Enron scandal, Congress* investiga
tive arm will soon decide whether to sue to force
the White House to turn over documents on the*
meetings last year with representatives of energy
companies. They included the now-collapsed
Enron Corp., a Houston-based company with
deep ties to Bush.
Cheney acknowledged that the dispute "proba
bly will get resolved in court." Last week, White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer had left open the
possibility of a compromise.
" I he ball is in the White House's court," Comp
troller General David Walker, who heads the Gener
al Accounting ()Hice, said in a telephone interview.
The White House said recently that representa
tives of Enron, an energy trader that was ranked as
the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, met six times
on energy issues last year with Cheney or his aides.
Thousands of employees and big and small in
vestors nationwide lost fortunes in Enron's plung
ing stock as the company spiraled into the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2.

1 he Justice Department is pursuing a criminal
investigation of Enron and its longtime auditor, the
accounting firm Arthur Andersen. 1 he Securities
and Exchange Commission has been investigating
since C )ct. 31. Eleven congressional committees also
have opened inquiries.
Asked whether anything in the energy plan was
included specifically for Enron or at its urging, Ch
eney replied: "I can't say. I'm sure they supported
many parts of it .... I can't say a particular propos
al came from them."
Cheney's statements on two Sunday talk shows
raised accusations by some Democrats of White
House stonewalling and the prospect of a battle
over presidential privilege reminiscent of the Clin
ton administration's bitter Whitewater disputes
with Republican lawmakers.
Two days before Bush's State of the Union ad
dress, Democratic Party leaders said the White
House is making a serious mistake and predicted
that Enron would be a looming issue in this year's
election campaigns.
In last week's swirl of developments, the fired
Andersen auditor responsible for checking Enron's
books invoked his Fifth Amendment right and re
fused to answer questions at a House hearing on the
massive shredding of documents, and Enron
(chairman Kenneth Lay — a friend of Bush and
one of his biggest contributors — resigned.
In a Houston suburb, a former Enron executive
who reportedly complained about the company's
questionable accounting practices was found shot to
death in what was ruled a suicide.
