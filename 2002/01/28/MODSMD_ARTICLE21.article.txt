### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
Arizona State came to Maples
Pavilion ready to play on Saturday.
l he Sun Devils were looking to
lake sole possession of second
place in the Pacific 10 Conference
as well as beat Stanford in Palo
Alto for the first time in 17 games.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 62,
Arizona State 48

lii the end, Lindsey Yamasaki
and Nicole Powell would simply
not allow it.
Hie Cardinal defeated Arizona
State (13-6, 7-4 Pac-10) 62-48 to
improve their record to 20-1 over
all and 10-0 in the conference.
The win did not come easily,
though.
II you look the other way and
discount the eftbrt by Yamasaki,
who scored 23 of the (Cardinal's 35
first-half points, ASU's confer
ence-leading defense managed to
throw the rest of the Stanford of
fense out of its rhythm. The team
shot 13-of-29 for the half, but if
Yamasaki is excluded, the num
bers drop to 4-of-1 6.
With a new look to the team's
starting line-up thanks to senior
guard Lauren St. Clair's first start
of the year at shooting guard, Ya
masaki found scoring opportuni
ties plentiful down in the post,
away from her usual spot on the
perimeter.
"I was frying to take what they
threw at me," Yamasaki said.
"When 112 start at [power forward],
it's a little easier to get going with
my penetration. When I play
against someone bigger, it's easier

to use my agility."
Her athleticism proved to be
too much for any Arizona State
player to handle in the half. Ya
masaki penetrated inside, collect
ing fouls and knocking in one
handed turn-around jumpers

only to hang back on the perime
ter a few plays later and nail two
consecutive deep 3-pointcrsoH as
sists from Powell.
Yamasaki scored 17 of the Car
dinal's last 18 points of the half on
her way to collet ling a season-high

27 before the game ended.
After starting the second half,
the combined talents of Yamasaki,
Powell, and senior forward
Bethany Donaphin pushed the
lead to more than 20 points with
just more than 11 minutes to play.
But that's when the Cardinal
went cold. 'Hie offensive woes of'the
112 irst half returned as the Sun Devils
went on a 21-7 run to cut the Stan
ford lead to eight points, with three
minutes left in the game.
Adding even more drama to
the situation, Yamasaki collected
her last four fouls in less than four
minutes while attempting to fend
off the ASU comeback and was
forced to the bench.
Powell immediately assumed
the leadership role vacated In her
teammate and sei/ed control of
the game on the next play. Ihe
sophomore forward, who had
doubled as point guard for most of
the game, came around to the top
of the arc to drill home a 3-pointer
and spark a final N-2 run, includ
ing another Powell three-pointer,
to finish off the Sun Devils
"It was the type of game where
we had them down by twenty and
they didn't go away," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "For us
to have a team make a run on us,
we need to play where we show
good poise. I thought Nicole and
Lindsey really helped us with that.
Nicole hit some huge shots when
we really needed them right down
the stretch.
"When you have players as ver
satile as Nicole and Lindsey, they
can guard different people, they
can switch, they can post-up, they
can shoot outside, [and] it's a real
luxury fora coach."

Senior forward Lindsey Yamasaki elevates over ASU's Lauren Stagg for two
of her career-high 27 points in Stanford's 62-48 victory on Saturday.

of her 1 S.<S average..
"Our team is working really
hard defensively, forcing teams to
take poor percentage [shots],"
VanDerveer said. "We started a
line-up where we put Lauren St.
Clair on [Levens], and others
played her really well. [Levens]
was the focus for us on our
perimeter defense.
"1 thought this was a great
game lor our team to come out
and play against a team that was
very physical in a very aggressive
game. It was the tough of game we
