# Fab Four beginning to gel for VanDerveer

### MAUREEN MULLEN STAFF WRITER 
A simple look through Satur
day's boxscore offers lew surprises
for Stanford women's basketball
fans. Lindsey Yamasaki and
Nicole l'owcll with 27 and 13
points, respectively, once again
captained the offensive forces for
the Cardinal.
Beyond the stats, one only
needed to witness a point at the
three-minute mark in the first half
— when back to back Yamasaki
threes, coming off beautiful Powell
passes, ignited a Stanford run that
put the game out of the Sun Dev
ils' grasp — to see that unquestion
ably these two are a special duo,
with a divine understanding of the
game.
Fittingly, it was Powell who hit
two huge threes in the final min
utes of the game, who put a defin
itive victory stamp on the day
when Arizona State got a little to
close for comfort.
However, while nobody can
argue that Powell and Yamasaki
have been essential in leading the
Stanford women to a 20-1 mark
and an unbeaten record in confer
ence play, these golden girls' star
power only begins to tell the suc -
cess story.
Powell and Yamasaki were
around last year, and while they
forced to confront a host of adjust
ment issues and had to step up to
unfamiliar positions, one never
quite saw the consistency that has
characterized their performance
this season.

So while hard work, practice
and just general maturing to the
game have played a large role in
each players success, it is also im
portant to look at the supporting
cast around them — most* notably
the four newcomers — who have
transformed the Cardinal from a
competitor night in and night out
to the team to beat in West Coast
women's basketball.
While T'Nae Thiel, kelley
Suminski, Sebnem Kimyacioglu
and Azella Perryman have all had
big games lor the Cardinal in the
past, it wasn't the stats these fresh
man put up on Saturday after
noon that showed their value, it
was the little things they did to
prove their worth beyond their
years.
fhiel, usually a consistent scor
ing threat, didn't get all that many
good looks and failed to put up a
basket, although she quietly
grabbed 10 rebounds for the Car
dinal. Her defense on the Sun
Devils' Melody Johnson, usually a
huge inside presence, helped keep
ASU at bay until the game's final
few minutes.
Suminski also wasn't finding
the net much all afternoon, but the
freshman drove the lane and drew
contact several times, scoring all
six of her points on the free throw
line. In addition, her careful ball
control gives the Cardinal the
added bonus of having a true
point guard on the floor.
Kimyacioglu might not have
taken a lot of shots, but the ones

she takes she makes, as the fresh
man is almost coming to be relied
on for her two c ritical 3-pointers a
game, which she knocks down
with ice-cold precision. She too is
adept at the challenges of han
dling the ball and can dish out as
sists and maintain tempo on the
floor on a consistent basis.
As for Ferryman, the newest
addition to the phenom class of
2005 has stepped up the past two
weekends lo give the Cardinal a
very consistent fourth post player.
She demonstrated this afternoon
that she can rebound and score
with the best of them, grabbing six
rebounds for Stanford in only 1 1
minutes of play.
lara VanDerveer's confidence
in her freshmen was clearly seen
on Saturday when Yamasaki
fouled out, and Arizona State got
within eight with three minutes to
play. At a point when most coach
es would be forced to rely on their
veterans, Thiel, Suminski and
Kimyacioglu all graced the floor
for the Cardinal.
All season long the talk has
been of the balance of the Cardi
nal. And while with most teams
balance would indicate a strong
roster of eight or so players with a
couple on the end of the bench to
come in fora few minutes and take
some fouls, the freshman class has
extended the Stanford numbers
to a consistent 10.
Not bad lor a bunch of new
comers.
