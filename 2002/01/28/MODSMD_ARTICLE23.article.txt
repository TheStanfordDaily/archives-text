I.()S ANGELES â€” Twenty
seven times, the Cardinal
missed an opportunity to store
on Saturday.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 23 USC 90,
No. 17 Stanford 82

Twenty-seven times, the
players watched the ball go t he
other way.
Twenty-seven times, Mike
Montgomery stood with a look
of consternation on his lace.
And 27 times, Stanford
watched its hid fora fifth straight
sweep of the Los Angeles schools
slowly lade away like the sun set
ting over the Santa Monica
Mountains.
Stanford does not keep
turnover records, but its 27 on
Saturday clearly set the bar din -
ing a 1)0-82 loss to the Trojans in
front 0f9,M2 at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena.
"We were casual with the ball,
we made one-hand passes and
didn't meet passes," Mont
gomery said. "We stood and
watched and nobody did what
they were supposed to do."
Twenty-seven reasons for the
loss, and no excuses. ()nly a few
explanations.
A lack of fundamental basket
ball. A lapse in focus. A dearth of
compt )sure.
Casey Jacobsen had seven
turnovers and Justin Davis had
six. Julius Barnes had five. F.ven
Tony Giovan hiniand |osli ( hil
dress added three apiece.
It was simply the wrong type
of a team effort.
Add the absence of junior
center (-urtis Bok hardt, who sat
out because ofa strained abdom
inal muscle, and the No. 17 (Car
dinal (12-5, 5-3 Pacific 10 Con

ference) looked lost once USC
switched to a full-court press in
the second hall.
"We were trying to just break
the press rather than trying to
score on the press, and that
makes a big difference," Jacob
sen said.
I he game started as a coast
through the streets of Los Ange
les. With a H-point first half
lead, and a .'57-30 lead at the half,
it seemed as if Stanford was al
ready on the highway back to
ward the Bay Area with its fifth
straight victory over the Trojans.
"The first half, [USC) looked
tired, They weren't really ready
to play and we had a good
chance to take advantage of it,"
Montgomery said. "Mentally,
they were hurting a little hit."
In the end, it was the Cardinal
that suffered the headache.
()nce the Trojans opted fora
full-court press, the court nar
rowed. The passing lanes were
bl< k ked.
I he (Cardinal's plight seemed
worse than rush hour traffic on
LA's 405 freeway: Jammed,
flapped. Nowhere to go.
Beating the press seemed like
driving through that same traf
fic: Problematic. Frustrating.
Impossible.
Essentially, there were no car
pool lanes, no fire lanes and no
shoulders to get by. The only
open lanes were going in the op
posite direction, as the Trojans
(15-4, 7-2) tallied 16 steals and
scored HI points of lol'the Cardi
nal turnovers. Most of them
were layups.
"'They were pressing with a
lot of confidence, lliey were
physical and they made the
court seem really small, said Ja

team-high 21 points. "They're

Julius Barnes, shown here driving to the hoop against Washington, met
with much more resistance from a deep and talented USC squad dur
