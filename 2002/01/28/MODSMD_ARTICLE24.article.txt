### KENNETH GARRETT 
With pool records falling left and right,
the top-ranked Stanford men's swimming
team improved to 0-0 for the year and 2-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference this weekend,
embarrassing both No. 0 Arizona with a
192-106 victory and No. 5 Arizona State
(5-2, 1-2) by a 136-99 mark.
Cardinal fans didn't have long to wait
before the first pool records came crashing
down at Avery Aquatic Center, as sopho
more Peter Marshall (47.27) and junior
Randall Hal (47.58) both crushed the 1999
record in the 100-yard backstroke (47.70),

taking first and second in the event.
Also boding ill for Arizona (3-2. 1-1 Pac
-10) was an early display of sophomore
Markus Rogan's versatility. Rogan posted
one of the Ik-m times in the <ountry in the
200 freestyle (1:37.01), even though it is
not one of his stronger events.

"It amazes everylxxly that he can swim
any event lie really wants to," said Marshall.
Rogan also won the 500 free (4:25.34)
on Friday and the 200 back (1:43.42) on
Saturday.
Heing sure to leave Arizona with the
strongest possible impression of Cardinal
might, Jeff Cuy man, Hal. Hobby O'Bryan
and Marshall capped off the day by setting
another pool record in the 200 freestyle
relay (1:20.27).
And as if the state of Arizona wasn't hu
miliated enough on Friday, the Cardinal
freight train crushed ASU in Satui clay's
first event and just kept on going. Hal

broke his first pool record of the day on
the backstroke leg of the 400 individual
medley with a 40.77, probably the fastest
'unshaved' time in the 100 back in the his
tory of swimming.
"I was a little more focused than I was
the day before," explained Hal. "I just
wanted to swim my heart out and see what
times it would put me at."
Another race people just c an't stop talk
ing about is sophomore Matt Sot lien's vic -
tory in the grueling 1000 freestyle, as he
touched the- wall with the- In st time in the
country this year (8:50.25) by more than
four seconds.

"Matt went out last and just lu-ld on,"
said senior tri-< aptain Peter Lennox-King.
"Ii was prett) awesome."
But the C ardinal still wasn't done
sweeping the deck with the Sun Devils.
