Beating someone ol Kovacs' caliber
made Kirk's victory even sweeter:
"I bis time around, I wasn't as intimi
dated of racing Kovacs as I was at the
| lexas lnxitational|," Kirk said. "She's a
great athlete and having her to swim
against will make me a lot better."
Boutwell won three individual events
lor the second-straight meet with victo
ries in the 50, 10, and 200 free, while co
captains Foschi and Ripple won two
apiece.
"Both meets went really well, and we
improved from Friday to Saturday, which

times that everyone did [on Saturday], es
pecially through the bad weather and after
another meet, show a lot of mental tough
ness and that we are foe used on the end of
the season."
