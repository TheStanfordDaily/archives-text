# Bledsoe leads Pats over Steelers
## 
### 
PHTSBURGfI (AP) — Drew Bledsoe replaced an
injured Tom Brady and led the New England Pa
triots to tht- Super Bowl with a 24-17 upset over the
Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC championship game
Sunday.
It wasn't a perfect performance by the man who
lost his job to Brady after being injured Sept. 2!* in
the season's second game. Bledsoe got plenty of
help from Troy Brown, who returned a punt 55
yards fora touchdown and was the middle man on
a 60-yard return of a blocked field goal that put
New England ahead 21 -3 early in the third quarter.
But Bledsoe still did what few backups could
do in a championship game: He threw 1 1 yards to
David Patten fora touchdown shortly after Brady
injured his left leg late in the first half, put the Pa
triots in position for Adam Vinatieri's fourth
quarter field goal and allowed New England to
hold the ball enough to avoid constant pressure
late in the game.
New England, which went from 5-1 I in 2000 to
1 1-5 this regular season, heads to its third Super
Bowl, in New Orleans next Sunday. I he Patriots
also went in 1986 and 1997, losing both times. Bled
soe was 10-of-2l for 102 yards.
Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart was 24-of
-42 for 255 yards but also threw three interceptions,
two in the last three minutes — by Tehuc ky Jones
and Lawyer Milloy - that helped seal the Patriots'
victory.
