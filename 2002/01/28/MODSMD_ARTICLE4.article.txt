As the Internet becomes a way
of life for college students, uni
versities are looking for ways to
use the World Wide Web as a vi
able teaching tool in the class
room. Stanford and MIT are
leading the way through the
Open Knowledge Initiative,
working to create coherent, easy
to-use Internet-based tools to be
used in the classroom.
At Stanford, Charles F. Kerns,

and online readings and create a
discussion forum for students.
Beginning this quarter,

partments or schools. More than
2,600 students are registered to
use the system.

faculty with various levels of Web
experience, so those with no expe
rience could be comfortable creat
ing a simple Web site, while those
with more experience have the
opportunity to organize complex
sites with various different tools.
Course Web sites are nothing
new to students. In the past, many
faculty-created Web sites used a
