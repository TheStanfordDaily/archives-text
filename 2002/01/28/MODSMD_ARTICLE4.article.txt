# Universities encourage use of course Web sites
## Sites such as Course-Work allow students to access materials online 
### SARAH PAPÃ‰ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Internet becomes a way
of life for college students, uni
versities are looking for ways to
use the World Wide Web as a vi
able teaching tool in the class
room. Stanford and MIT are
leading the way through the
Open Knowledge Initiative,
working to create coherent, easy
to-use Internet-based tools to be
used in the classroom.
At Stanford, Charles F. Kerns,

tlic education-technology manag
er for academic: computing, is
working on designing a course
management system.
Kerns told the Chronicle of
Higher Education, "Making an
engaging Web site with all the con
tent is not really the important
part of course Web sites; it's the
communication aspect.
"I'd say a good Web site is one
that doesn't just sort of hang out
there as an independent entity,
but is an important part of teach
ing for the course," he added.
11 1 rough the Open Knowledge
Initiative, Academic Computing
recently developed Course Work,
a Web site development and distri
bution system t hat allows faculty to
set up course sites, live program

allows the* professor to display an
nouncements, post the syllabus
and online readings and create a
discussion forum for students.
Beginning this quarter,

Course Work was made available
to all faculty. I here are already
200 course Web sites 112 rom 200 fac
ulty and staff from 22 different de
partments or schools. More than
2,600 students are registered to
use the system.
Hie program was designed for
faculty with various levels of Web
experience, so those with no expe
rience could be comfortable creat
ing a simple Web site, while those
with more experience have the
opportunity to organize complex
sites with various different tools.
Course Web sites are nothing
new to students. In the past, many
faculty-created Web sites used a
commercial system, such as Cour

selnfo, to make information avail
able through the web.
Academic Computing officials
explained that Course Work sites
will have the same functions as
their commercial counterparts.

According to the Course Work
web site, the new system is differ
ent because it has "the capac it\ to
be extended and modified to ac
commodate Stanford's faculty's
ideas about how course content
should be represented."
1 lie sites help many professors
save paper and prevent students
from losing all tin- handouts that
accumulate, especially during the

shopping period.
"I like the course Web silt's,'
said freshman Chelsea Dudek
said. "It's helpful to have the syl
labus always there and know
what's coming up next.
But for freshman MelanieChen
the paper-less versions of class ma
terial turn out to be more of hassle.
"I hate having to print out all
the information, Chen said.
