### PAYAL DALAL 
This Saturday, students gathered in Kresge
Auditorium to kit k oil a conference on Creat
ing Social Change in the 21st Century.
Organized by the Future Social Innovators
Network, a student group in its second year of
existence, the conference addressed topics of
social entrepreneurship and social innova
tion. By holding the conference, FUSION
aimed to follow its mission statement of "in
spire, inform and involve the next generation
of social entrepreneurs."
FUSION founder and out-going president
Tarek Ghani, a junior, said he envisioned the
conference as a forum to increase the impact of
public service efforts by plugging students into

the growing movement of social innovation -
tlu- attempts of private individuals to revolu
tionize the social arena by introducingconcepts
Irom general management, entrepreneurship
and social science.
Fhe conference began with a keynote ad
dress by Dr. Fdward Blakely, the Dean of the
Robert |. Milano Graduate School of Manage
ment and Urban Policy at the New School in
New York. Dr. Blakely, referring to the 21st
century as the century of the "social problem,"
spoke of the need to be socially innovative and
socially aware. He also outlined four elements
he saw central to the idea of social entrepre
neurship: intrapreneurship, collective innova
tion. group support and collective capitalism.
Following the keynote speaker, FUSION or
ganized two breakout discussion panels and
one plenary panel. Panelists drawn from Stan
lord academia and a variety of non-profit orga
nizations discussed topics ranging from tech
nology, social service innovation, ethics, educa
tion and philanthropy.

Some addressed the need for corporate effi
ciency in the management of non-profits, while
others stressed the importance of shared values
and concrete missions.
The plenary panel, entitled " The Future of
Social Innovation at Stanford," focused on the
opportunities and resources available to Stan
ford students interested in pursuing social en
trepreneurship. Panelists included Chairman of
the Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund I.aura
Arrillaga, Professor of Public Policy and Urban
Studies Gordon Bloom, Haas Center Director
NadinneC.ru/, Director of Stanford's (.enter for
Social Innovation james Phillsancl Ghani.
They recounted their experiences and em
phasized the need to get involved, to make con
tributions, to take advantage of resources and
to network.
Participants in the conference were both nu
merous and enthusiastic. When asked why she
attended, junior Christie Brawnersaid, "being a
community organizing major, I
saw it as a good opportunity to hear
experts in the field."
Many participants indicated
they came away with a sense of
duty, potential, and motivation.
Current FUSION president
Amanda Kahn, a junior, said, "As
an organization, we were really
pleased that approximately 300
people came to learn more about
Social Entrepreneurship, and we
hope that the energy created dur
ing the conference will translate
into positive action around cam
pus, and in the community."
Social entrepreneurship was a
term continually defined as the
amalgamation of the ethics of pub
lic service and the entrepreneurial
spirit. Former Graduate School of
Business Prof. |. Gregory Dees ex
plained the idea of social entrepre
neurship as fhe blending of "the
passion of a social mission with an
image of business-like discipline,
innovation and determination."
