# Overseas apps remain high despite Sept. 11 events

### NIKI WILSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four months after the terrorist attacks in on
the United States, students who applied to
study abroad in tall of 2002 ahead of last Fri
day's deadline had additional considerations to
take into account this year.
Since Sept. 1 1, the Overseas Studies Pro
gram has already collet ted a round of overseas
applications for students departing this
spring. They typically are busiest flu ring win
ter quarter, when most sophomores apply to
spend fall quarter of their junior year in an in
ternational locale.
OSP Exec. Director Jacqueline Wender
acknowledged that autumn is traditionally
the most popular quarter to spend over
seas studies.
Final application numbers for fall 2002 were
unavailable, but Wender expressed hope that
application numbers will be significantly
greater than last fall'sas "increasing numbers of
students |find] the importance of those events"
in their lives as well as academic pursuits.
Based on projections for spring quarter, Wen
der estimates that for the ent ire 2001-02 academ
ic year — the first three quarters following Sept.
1 1 —there will have been a 50-student increase
in overseas enrollment from last academic year.
This amount is a potential increase of at
least 10 percent in the- numbers of students
studying abroad as approximately 500 stu
dents participate in overseas studies annually.
Sophomore Marika Ktiowles, who applied
to the Paris and Oxford programs last week,
said she was skeptical of a direct connection be
tween the projected increase and recent world
events, suggesting that "going abroad has
never been about increasing world peace, but
about experiencing another world culture."
"From talking to other Stanford students, I
don't think people are [deciding to go abroad]
based on 9/ 11," Knowles added.
Academic Program Officer Susan Christo
pher indicated that two new coursework initia
tives for Overseas Studies that were conceived
before Sept. 1 1 are "now even more compelling
in light of world events."

One new program, which began this quar
ter, is the offering of World War II theme
courses in all five European Stanford centers
every winter. They will culminate in late March
with an academic conference in Berlin, involv
ing instructors and participants from Berlin,
Florence, Paris, Oxford and Moscow.
The second initiative, still under develop
ment fora spring 2003 launch, will offer a series
of courses on the theme of Islamic religion at
Stanford in Moscow.
In terms of security, Wender emphasized
that "our centers have always operated at a
higher [-than-normal] level of security," and
thus response to the attacks focused the atten
tion of program administrators on simply reas

suring that existing security was adequate.
What has changed in time for the deadline
to Autumn 2002 programs is the application
format. OSP recently introduced the Stan
lord University Application System, or
SunAppSys, an online program through Res
idential Computing that eliminates the need
for paper applications.
In contrast to previous quarters' applications,
SunAppSys also allows students to use one form
to apply to multiple overseas centers.
Also new to the Program for the 2002-2003
academic year are increased capacities for en
rollment in Florence and Paris. Both centers
now offer programs in the spring as well as the
fall and winter.
