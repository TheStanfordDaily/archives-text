## Cold weather makes for physical stress, potential injuries 
### MICHAEL ENDLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Roble Dante Studio is nor
mally filled with jazzy swing
routines, elegant waltzes,
grateful leaps and pirouettes;
but thanks to the onset of win
ter and an antiquated heating
system, lately it has been popu
lated by shivering and oft-in
jured dancers.
Many dancers have ex
pressed concern over the stu
dio's heating problems. Ta
tiana Catanzarite, a freshman
taking ballet, said, "It is freez
ing and I am really afraid of
pulling my hamstring."
Arnd lonescu, a computer
science graduate student, has
experienced the physical mani
festation of latiana's fears.
"Dancing in the cold has
badly aggravated an ankle in
jury of mine from two - and - a -
half years ago th.it had pretty
much gone away," she said.
"Ever since the weather turned
cold, danc ing has been excep
tionally painful for me."
Diana Movius, a sophomore,
explained that "weekend re
hearsals don't have a lot of bod
ies to create heat |so} we can't
dance to our fullest extent."
"Also." Movius said, "it is

frustrating for the profession
als and choreographers we
hire because if we can't fulfill
our potential, they can't see
their work performed to its
112 ullest extent."
Miriam VVenger, a sopho
more who used to be a profes
sional dancer with the Miami
City Ballet, said the cold could
be potentially "dangerous".
"Dancing should be treated
as an athletic activity. It is an art
form, but it also puts a tremen
dous amount of stress on your
body," she said.
For some, the conditions have
merely been an inconvenience.
"It is definitely (old but there
are so many people moving
around that it isn't that bad," ,"
junior Rachel Osborne, a hip
hop dancer said.
I onv Kramer, a dance in
striK tor ;it Roble. said the condi
tions tan be attributed to the fact
that "it is cold out and Roble
Dante Studio is a large, open
space." The heating system, he
said, is "antiquated ... so it
doesn't have the latest technical
abilities to deal with our recent
cold snap."
"We are working on getting
the best we can out of the heat
ing system in the studio,"
Kramer continued. "I think
things are improved now and
will improve a bit more.
" I lie recent cold snap has re
minded us of how vulnerable our
must Its and Ixnlies are when not
warmed up," he added.
