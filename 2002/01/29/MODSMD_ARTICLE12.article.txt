## PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY You and me, You and I 
### 
I've heard :11 k I talked enough about
polic \. so< ial engineering and olliei
people. \\ 11 \ see die world in the
third-person, when we know that
lite is ultiinatclv ahout vou and me, about
all ol usr
Instead. I've been thinking about vou,
and how much 1 (ait-about vou. 1 hope
you're not embarrassed to hear this: that
it matters to me what vou're thinking,
what you're doing, how you're doing.
I admire you. You are an ama/ing
evolution ol'order, balance, cvcles and
coined) You are a survivor, and that is
ama/inii. I am too. I think vou are

beautiful.
But vou've been bum
ming 111 e out latelv.
What are vou so afraid
of? You're s( ai ing me.
Sometimes vou don't
even lock at me when we
walk past each other,
even when we sit next to
each other. Sometimes,
I'll smile as we pass, and

I
you'll just start* dcfensiveU back. I hat
gives me tlu- shivers.
You've been so inconsiderate latelv.
You ( lit me oil vesterdav. ou pushed
me and didn't even turn hack to apolo
gize. You scowled at me .is il I were
stupid. I had to deal w itli a big mess that
you lelt. What's going on?
Mavhe its because you've been so
biis\. I>lll win are \ou so stressed?
You're not even sleeping enough.
I don't think \ou're afraid of dying,
but are von afraid ol not living il vou
don't scramble around? How (I \ou get
cursed? Did I do it?
I> it me that vou Ye alraid ol? I worn
about this, because I think vou might be
trving to eat most ol the pie before I get
to it. And then this freaks me out. because
1 don't know how much vou'd leave for
me. So now I'm s< rambling bet ause vou
are; mavhe vou started scrambling be
cause vou thought I was.
I enjo\ how we < an push each othet
when we stud\ together, or play sports
with each other. 1 like running together,
com-peting, with vou. It's fun, and both
ol us <an do better that wav. Sometimes I
even like it when vou do better than I do.
It would make sense if vou specialized in
something you do well, while I lot us on
something I do well. But wli\ do I some
times resent vou when vou Ye successful?
And, when vou beat me, w In were \ou so
smugly satisfied?
More than ever, we're like the people
who must feed each other because their
spoons are too long to Iced themselves.
You help me so much I can't imagine
wanting to live without vou. You give my
life meaning.
But, still, I have a sense we've ret ently
been asking too much of each other.
Would vou be upset il I didn't read everv
e-mail you sent me? Gould we still be
friends il I told you I wanted to sleep in
stead of helping you with the problem
set? Would vou tout in ue to support me i I
I told you I wanted to work no more
hours than my parents?
We can be like the lobsters who trao

each other in .1 pot because each at
tempts to push off against their neigh
boi s. ()r we can be like the trapeze artists
who can jump higher and farther be
cause we know someone w ill be there to
t atc h us.
1 don't remember seeing you in so
man\ Hues until recentlv. I think this
means even bettei possibilities! But for
now, though, it's a little bit scar) being
around more people, more strangers,
than ever. Is that win the soil has become
thinner, the weather stranger, the sun
harsher? Is that wh\ vou seem so distant?
Because we're asking too much from
each other? I'm not sure win. In any
case, you do feel distant.
I feel so profouncllv lonely sometimes
that 1 think no one will ever understand,
or truh care about, me. I mean. I know
this is not true — 01 is it — and I'm prob
ablv over-reac ting — or am I?
I am so profoundl) bored sometimes
th.it I feel like jumping out of a plane, or
turning mv life into a soap opera, or pur
suing more monev than anyone I've ever
known, or blow ing up something signifi
cant, or just something. 1 sometimes feel
like I have to take niv life to the extreme
in orclei to feel alive. ()r at least in order
to distract me fora little while. Hut I
know that this won't help me feel auv less
lonely.
I like thinking that vou and I may be
living in the same world. I think we
prohahlv see the same colors, think in
the s.ime language and worry about
similar things, like that we might not be
loved, or not be able to love. 1 realize
that fin often describing you when I
describe myself.
I hat's win I like it so 11111 c h w hen we
connect. I can tell sometimes when
vou've left some place a little more hos
pitable. 1 leel so good when I see you
helping others keep their balance. I like
it when vou give me little gifts. I like it
when vou look into ntv eves.
falling in love is about the most fun
tiling I can think of, and I bet you'd
agree. You know what it's like to lose
vourself in another, to join something
bigger, to become one. W hen I love you,
we understand this.
But I'm pretty nervous now, because
our future is murkv. 011 the one hand,
I'm afraid, because I can imagine us
lighting 111 uc h more and then becoming
more callous and numb. 011 the other
hand. I can imagine more of us falling in
love. I can see us either destroying our
souls 01 bee oming enlightened.
Do you feel the same way? I think you
probably agree — if only deep down —
that we can't continue to live as we are
and that some significant things are
going to happen soon.
But, here we are. I'm confused too. I
don't know why exactl) I'm here either.
But, while we're here, now, let's have
some fun together.

Because we're asking too much from
each other? I'm not sure win. In any
case, you do feel distant.
I feel so profouncllv lonely sometimes

it when vou give me little gifts. I like it
when vou look into ntv eves.
falling in love is about the most fun

agree. You know what it's like to lose
vourself in another, to join something
bigger, to become one. W hen I love you,
we understand this.
But I'm pretty nervous now, because
our future is murkv. 011 the one hand,
I'm afraid, because I can imagine us

hand. I can imagine more of us falling in
love. I can see us either destroying our
souls 01 bee oming enlightened.
Do you feel the same way? I think you
probably agree — if only deep down —
that we can't continue to live as we are
and that some significant things are
going to happen soon.

I've heard :11 k I talked enough about
polic \. so< ial engineering and olliei
people. \\ 11 \ see die world in the
third-person, when we know that
lite is ultiinatclv ahout vou and me, about
all ol usr
Instead. I've been thinking about vou,
and how much 1 (ait-about vou. 1 hope
you're not embarrassed to hear this: that
it matters to me what vou're thinking,
what you're doing, how you're doing.
I admire you. You are an ama/ing
evolution ol'order, balance, cvcles and
coined) You are a survivor, and that is
ama/inii. I am too. I think vou are

beautiful.
But vou've been bum
ming 111 e out latelv.
What are vou so afraid
of? You're s( ai ing me.
Sometimes vou don't
even lock at me when we
walk past each other,
even when we sit next to
each other. Sometimes,
I'll smile as we pass, and

I
you'll just start* dcfensiveU back. I hat
gives me tlu- shivers.
You've been so inconsiderate latelv.
You ( lit me oil vesterdav. ou pushed
me and didn't even turn hack to apolo
gize. You scowled at me .is il I were
stupid. I had to deal w itli a big mess that
you lelt. What's going on?
Mavhe its because you've been so
biis\. I>lll win are \ou so stressed?
You're not even sleeping enough.
I don't think \ou're afraid of dying,
but are von afraid ol not living il vou
don't scramble around? How (I \ou get
cursed? Did I do it?
I> it me that vou Ye alraid ol? I worn
about this, because I think vou might be
trving to eat most ol the pie before I get
to it. And then this freaks me out. because
1 don't know how much vou'd leave for
me. So now I'm s< rambling bet ause vou
are; mavhe vou started scrambling be
cause vou thought I was.
I enjo\ how we < an push each othet
when we stud\ together, or play sports
with each other. 1 like running together,
com-peting, with vou. It's fun, and both
ol us <an do better that wav. Sometimes I
even like it when vou do better than I do.
It would make sense if vou specialized in
something you do well, while I lot us on
something I do well. But wli\ do I some
times resent vou when vou Ye successful?
And, when vou beat me, w In were \ou so
smugly satisfied?
More than ever, we're like the people
who must feed each other because their
spoons are too long to Iced themselves.
You help me so much I can't imagine
wanting to live without vou. You give my
life meaning.
But, still, I have a sense we've ret ently
been asking too much of each other.
Would vou be upset il I didn't read everv
e-mail you sent me? Gould we still be
friends il I told you I wanted to sleep in
stead of helping you with the problem
set? Would vou tout in ue to support me i I
I told you I wanted to work no more
hours than my parents?
We can be like the lobsters who trao

each other in .1 pot because each at
tempts to push off against their neigh
