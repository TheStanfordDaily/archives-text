SCN botches Jack Johnson concert
Letters to I lie l)ail\ are supposed to be
articulate and eloquent. M\ words should
he flowery, long, and complex. I lowever, I
can't think ol ail) other wa\ to express I his:
Stanford ('.oncert Network, you suck.
It's had enough that S(.\ ha rely man
ages to bring one decent act to campus a
sear. Roots and (ommon were great. 1 )ig
ital I nderground and Sir Mix-a-Lot? Nice
trv. But when S( IN announced its Big De
cent Show ()l I lie Year, Jack |ohnson, I
was excited. I le's a great musician, and I
was stoked lor the show. 1 figured I should
show up earl) on Monday morning tor
tickets, so 1 arrived at the ticket office
around '.MM), only to find an impressive
line already formed.
There was a surprising number of peo
ple alreach' ahead of me. but not an unrea
sonable number. Dinkelspiel Auditorium
sits 700 people, light? A line of 150 students
didn't seem like the end of tlie world. And
since the people ahead of me had slept out
overnight, oi shown up at 6:00 for tic kets, I
figured that the\ deserved lobe rewarded
lor their effort, 112 or me, and for the leu hun
dred other people behind me who also
showed upearh and wailed in the cold fora
lew hours, I thought we deserved our tick
ets, too.
S( \ representatives walked around the
lines, announc ing that two tickets could he
purchased per SI ID. Furthermore, three
SI I Ds could be carried per person, allow
ing a maximum of six tic kets per person to
be purchased. A feeding frenzy ensued.
1 atecomersand people from the hue k of the
linesc urried togivctheirSl IDs and money
to friends in the front. (.ell phones called
rc >oi ni nates, who hurried out ofbed to bring
their SI II )s and cash to the front ol the line.
While the S( '.N lolk stroked their egos
and walked around taking pictures of the
massive line stretched across the Quad

("look how many people couldn't get tic k
ets!'), the first hundred or so people in line
completeh bought out a 700 person venue,
leaving the remaining hundreds of people
ticket less, cold and frustrated.
I wo tickets per ST ID? Sure, you can
bring a date. I liree SUIDs per person?
I hat's a joke. It's great that SCN managed
to line up an excellent performer that gen
erated considerable student interest. In the
future, though, they should either figure
out a more equitable way to distribute t i< k
ets, or warn the rest of us that we might as
well stav at home and sleep in.

Stanford should protect its property
This is in response to the letter by Amber
Baker and Nina Robertson, which attac ked
the Daily for publishing the news ston
about the lice-infested vagrant arrested for
trespassing on Stanford property.
Let ns go through a few facts. Kirst, Stan
ford I Diversity is private property. I hat en
titles Stanford to .ill rights guaranteed to
property owners under the law. Second, re
turning to a privately owned properly alter
having expressly been forbidden to do sob)
the property owner constitutes an act ol
trespassing. That warrants arrest. Third,
homeless people and other vagrants often
are mentally unstable, have criminal histo
ries and thus pose a danger to other mem
bers of the community.
Baker and Robertson chose to lex us on
the fact that homeless people themselves
olien have limited security due to the nature
of their living conditions. That is indeed
true. I lowever, that in no way implies that
the entire Stanford population should then
Ik- subjec ted to the same lac k of security as
that enjoyed by the homeless.

Fourth, it is a lact that the hygiene of
homeless people leaves much to be de
sired. I Ins is self-evident, hut it seems
necessan to state this given Baker and
Robert son's assertion t hat the picture of a
louse in the art iclc "pet pet nates degrad
ing stereotypes that equate homeless
people with unclean alien intruders." It is
a fact that the woman had lice on her
head. B\ virtue of being a trespasser, she
can be classified as an intruder. There
fore, the term "tint lean alien intruder" is
pret isely correct.
In their further ellort to transfer the
blame ol homelcssness from the shoulders
of this female vagrant to the entire Stan
ford community. Baker and Robertson
proceed to claim that "lice are a common
problem in even the most sterile of living
conditions." Really? Where? Mow many
non-homeless people that shower every
day and adhere to other principles of basic
hygiene and have head lice do Baker and
Robertson know?
Before I get branded asa heartless impe
rialist dassist misogynist colonialist fascist
counter-revolulionarv capitalist pig by the
crowd of radical homeless apologists, let me
point out that many of the same people who
have reservations about letting the homeless
roam in student dorms (including myself)
have in the past volunteered to help in
homeless shelters and soup kitchens, all in
an effort to help the homeless in ways that
actually matter. I am sure that Baker and
R<>bertson have done the same, as I am sure
that they have been involved in other pro
grams to help the homeless. My only hope is
that they realize that the answer to the
homeless problem does not lie in inviting
the homeless to steal shampoo from student
dorms while infec ting the population with
head lice.
