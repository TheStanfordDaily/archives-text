another second-place finish on
that event.
Saturday's marquee event for
the Cardinal was the rings, with
All-American l.rwin tinning in a
near-flawless performance to gar
ner first place in that event. His
9.600, coupled with Durante's
9.150, helped the team win the
rings by almost a lull point over its
nearest competitor.
Four 9s later, the Cardinal had

earned second place on the vault,
going into the final two events of
the night with ;i possibility <>112 steal
ing the competition from the high
ly-favored Golden Beat s.
A distaste from lasi year must
have remained though, as the par
allel and high bars turned out to be
the most forgettable moments of
the night.
Gill turned out to be one of the
only bright spots for the squad, as
he posted <i 8.500 and 8.800 on
parallel bars and high bar, respec
tively, good for third place on each.
Junior Paul O'Leary and fresh
man Kelly Lang both came to Gill's
aid on the high bars, but their per

formances couldn't save the team
on the high bars, as several possibly
fatigued competitors led the team
to a last-place finish in that event.
"We still have to practice more
and more routines until we have
them as close to perfect as possi
ble," Durante said. "It was a good
stin i to the season, but we still have
a long way to go."
f'he schedule doesn't get any
easier, with a rematch against (lal in
two weeks and a highly-touted
matc hup with No. 1 ()klahoma in a
month. But if the team can forget its
jitters on the bars, it may yet prove
that it is a reincarnation of Coach
I lamada's teams from the 90s.
