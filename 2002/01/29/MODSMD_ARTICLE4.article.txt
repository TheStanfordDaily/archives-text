Daniel Pearl, a Stanford graduate of the
(llass 0f1985 and aeuirent reporter for the
Wall Street Journal, is allegedly Ix'ing held
hostage in Karachi, Pakistan, by a group
named "The National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty."
I he group sent an e-mail and four
photographs of Pearl shackled — and in
one instance with a gun held — to his
head, to several news organizations in
cluding The New York limes, The
Washington Post, The Los Angeles rimes
and several publications based in the
Middle East last Saturday.
The Wall Street Journal did not receive
the e-mail.
In the e-mail, kidnappers accused
Pearl of working for the Central Intelli
gence Agency and made several de
mands. They want the United States to
return Pakistani prisoners in Cuba cap
tured in the war against Afghanistan and
also to release F-16 fighter jets that Pak
istan bought in the 1980s.
I'lie e-mail also said that Pearl is "at pre
sent being kept in very inhuman circum

stances" and equated this condition to the
U.S.'s treatment of the detainees in Cuba.
1 lie ( '.I A has denied any connection to
Pearl.
I he State Department has not yet ver
ified that the photographs are authentic
and issued a statement saying that they
had never heard of the group that sent
the e-mail.
"While we have no independent in
formation to verify the group's state
ments, we take them quite seriously," a
State Department spokesperson told the
Stanford Daily.
The spokesperson referred to Pearl asa
"respected journalist" and said that the
I )epartment is working with Pakistani offi
cials to retrieve him.
"We of course believe that he should be
released immediately and unconditional
ly,' she said. I lie Department would not
disc uss intelligence information regarding
Pearl's exact whereabouts or any efforts to
rescue him.
Pearl was last seen on Wednesday
night. The New York rimes reported
that he had been working on a story
about Richard Reid, the alleged "shoe
bomber," and was going to interview the

leader of the Army of Muhammad, a mil
itant Islamic organization, on the night
of his alleged abduction.
"In the interests of humanity, the ter
rorists should release Mr. Pearl imme
diately,' said a statement issued by
Steven Goldstein, vice president of Dow
Jones Co., which publishes the Jour
nal. "Mr. Pearl is a private citizen em
ployed by an independent newspaper.
Neither he nor we can change the poli
cies of the United States or Pakistan,"
the statement said.
Goldstein told the Daily that he had
no information about why the group tar
geted Pearl.

of 1985 with distinction and with honors.
