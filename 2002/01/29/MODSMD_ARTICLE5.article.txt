# New technology benefits disabled students
## 
### ELLIE RITCH STAFF WRITER 
For Adam Kahn, taking notes during
Pr6f. John Bravnian's lectures on "In
troductory Science of Materials" until
now has been a daunting task. Kahn,
like many other Stanford students,
struggles with learning disabilities. At
tention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
makes it extremely difficult for him to
listen during lecture and jot clown notes
simultaneously.
"1 am not the best note taker," said
Kahn, who is c urrently working wit h the
Disability Resource (Center and Bravman
to test a computerized transcription sys
tem geared to aid disabled students in
lecture halls.
Starting this quarter, Stanford will be
the first test site in the United States fora
system called Liberated Learning, which
allows the lecturing professor's words to
be converted to text in real-time onto an
overhead screen. After class, the lecture
can be posted verbatim on the Web or
translated into Braille lot blind users.
Thanks to Charles Sc hwab's sponsor
ship of the LL project at Stanford, Kahn
and other students with disabilities
might significantly raise the percentage
of information they are able to extract
from lectures.
"Having a whole transcript to look

over after the class will be very helpful,"
Kahn said.
1 he LL system is composed of two
components: speech recognition soft
ware by Il\M called Via Voice and
Net Scribe, a program that interprets
pauses in speech as line breaks in the dis
played text. Stanford is partnering with
IBM and other universities in this pro
ject and is currently piloting the technol
ogy in three classrooms this quarter.
Shelley I laven, the Center's technolo
gy coordinator and academic tec hnology
specialist, believes this teaching tool is of
value to students with many different
types of disabilities.
"Students with certain learning dis
abilities or cognitive disabilities can bene
fit from LL, as can those with physical im
pairments," she said. "For these learners,
I Lean be a surrogate note taker."
St. Mary's University in Canada lias
been using the software for two years
and has found that the technology is a
useful resource to all students, whether
or not they are disabled. In past tests at
St. Mary's, LL has proven to maintain
( .) ( .) percent comprehension, or mean
ing, accuracy. Speaking clearly and al
lowing for proper distinction between
words results in better word-for-word
accuracy.
"Some users with good enunciation
and no accent will start at 95 percent ac

curacy or higher," said I laven. "For users
with significant foreign accents, speech
recognition programs have specially-tai
lored versions."
A few of these versions include Aus
tralian or British English, East Indian
English and Asian English.
According to Haven, it takes approxi
mately 15 minutes to program a speak
er's initial voice profile before first time
transcription use.
Joan Bisagno, Ph.D., the Center's as
sistant dean and director, is excited about
the future educational opportunities LE
software will bring to campus.
"Soon speaker dependent software
will capture the voices of students in a
seminar setting," she said.
lu order for this next goal to be real
ized, the application will have to be able
to recognize and program the voices of
multiple speakers at once.
Bisagno predicts that LE system soon
will become a product that both students
with disabilities and all members of the
Stanford community will not want to
live without.
"This software is the virtual ramp fbi
education," she said.
For students with physical or cogni
tive or learning disabilities, this virtual
ramp might prove to be a gateway to a
broader and more accessible education
at Stanford.
