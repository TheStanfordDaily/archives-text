# Night Outreach helps homeless
## 
### ANTHONY HA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Several nights a week, Stanford
students walk along I niversity .Av
enue, interacting vviili the home
less and distributing basic necessi
ties. On these walks, which are or
ganized by Stanford's Night Out
reach program, students give out
necessities like socks, shampoo, ra
zors and food, as well "survival
cards", which list services available
in the area for the homeless.
"Our goal is not simply to give
hand-outs but to develop friend
ships with those we encounter on
the street," said senior Kugene
Liu, Night Outreach's financial
and operations coordinator. "IU
confronting issues of homelessness
on a personal level, we feel that we
develop a kind of personal insight
that shapes our lives in a meaning
ful and perhaps profound way."
According to I.in, Night Out
reach was started in 1998 by Dana
Smith of Powers of the Urban
Ministry of Palo Alto and Angela
Rang, a Stanford intern for the

same organization.
Ii was modeled after successful
outreach programs and formed
with the assistance of the Palo Alto
Police Department, the Larkin
Street Youth Center in San Fran
cisco and the Community Home
less Alliance Ministry in San Jose.
Night (hitreach became a student
group in 1999 and became affiliat
ed with the- I laas (Center for Public
Set vice last fall.
Liu said that one of the major
obstacles facing the program,
which had 1 ("> active members (stu
dents' who went on at least two
walks) last quarter, is getting stu
dents to make the necessary time
commitment.
"Stanford students are busy; it's
quite often that some other on
campus activity interferes with the
weekly two hour walks that stu
dents go on," he said.
"Also, another challenge is de
veloping the activist portion of our
organization," he added. "Being
an activist requires a substantial
time commitment on top of the
weekly walks."

Sophomore Karl Stuen, presi
dent of Night Outreach, agreed
that getting more students in
volved, as well as continuing out
read i in Palo Alto, was the pro
gram's main short-term goal.
"Our long-term goals are to be
come more activism based, branch
out to other communities and be
come an organi/er ol homeless di
alogue on campus," he said.
A sister organization of Night
Outreach is Street Forum, a quar
terly magazine dealing with
poverty and homelessness in the
Bay Area.
Street Forum, which was start
ed last year, grew out of Night
()utreach — its founders were in
volved in Night Outreach and
wanted to create "a space to ex
plore, discuss and raise aware
ness about issues surrounding
homelessness and poverty," said
junior Jessica Jenkins, Street
Forum's news editor. "Now, the
two organizations are closely
linked, with many overlapping

Liu said that one of the major
obstacles facing the program,
which had 1 ("> active members (stu
dents' who went on at least two
walks) last quarter, is getting stu
dents to make the necessary time
commitment.
"Stanford students are busy; it's
quite often that some other on
campus activity interferes with the
weekly two hour walks that stu
dents go on," he said.
"Also, another challenge is de
veloping the activist portion of our
organization," he added. "Being
an activist requires a substantial
time commitment on top of the
weekly walks."

Sophomore Karl Stuen, presi
dent of Night Outreach, agreed
that getting more students in

Several nights a week, Stanford
students walk along I niversity .Av
enue, interacting vviili the home
less and distributing basic necessi
ties. On these walks, which are or
ganized by Stanford's Night Out
reach program, students give out
necessities like socks, shampoo, ra
zors and food, as well "survival
cards", which list services available
in the area for the homeless.
"Our goal is not simply to give
hand-outs but to develop friend
ships with those we encounter on
the street," said senior Kugene
Liu, Night Outreach's financial
and operations coordinator. "IU
confronting issues of homelessness
on a personal level, we feel that we
develop a kind of personal insight
that shapes our lives in a meaning
ful and perhaps profound way."
According to I.in, Night Out
reach was started in 1998 by Dana
Smith of Powers of the Urban
Ministry of Palo Alto and Angela
Rang, a Stanford intern for the

same organization.
