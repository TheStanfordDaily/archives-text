# Meeting revives LAS fight
## Students reopen the discussion about the future of Latin American Studies 
### MELISANDE MIDDLETON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
East Thursday's student organized
Eown Hall meeting at El Centro Chicano
discussed the controversy over Stanford's
Latin American Studies program. Stu
dents and lac 11 It \ showed a willingness to
revive tlie program that has been consid
erably undermined since its bachelor's
and master's degrees were canceled last
Dec ember, according to I AS major Derek
Jackson, a junior.
I lie I AS department traditionally spon
sored an array of academic activities involv
ing Latin America. lAS funds student re
search, attracts distinguished guest lectur
ers, houses seminars and conferences and
still offers an honors certificate and minor.
"When the BA and MA degrees were
c anceled last year by the Faculty Senate's
(lommitlee for I ndergraduate Studies at
the request of the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences, the program's backbone
was undermined," said Jackson. "Al
though t he I lonorsand Minors programs

were left in place, they have now come
under scrutiny and are currently under
review by C-US as well."
(Cancellation <>l'these programs will result
in a loss of both funding and student in
volvement in lAS. according to Jackson.
"An institution of learning ... cannot ex
pect an area of stuch to survive or improve it
self if students are systematically excluded
from the discipline's ac tivities," lie- said.
"Perhaps the most frightening ramifica-

ing," he said. "Without money, the
death oft tie entire program is an ir
refutable certainty."
Bob Gregg, cognizant dean for
Graduate and Undergraduate
Studies in the Sc hoot of I lumanities
and Sciences, pointed out that the
degree programs were being dis
continued "without prejudice."
" The phrase 'without prejudice'
employed in the committee discus
sions indicates thai the committees
are quite open to considering the re
instatement of these degree pro
grams in strengthened and faculty
supported forms." Gregg said.
Thursday's discussion was open

to .ill Stanford community mem
bers and was aimed at demonstrat
ing to the I r niversity\s administra
tion that there is broad-based stu
dent support for lAS. Students
signed a petition and letters that
outlined the issue from a student
perspective and were addressed to
dec ision-making faculty.
Ihe administration's official ex
planation for these changes is that
fewer tenured faculty members have
recently been teaching core courses
and advising theses in LAS.
However, some department
members disagree.
11 lis explanat i< >n, hew ever. < >nlv
acts to cover-up the real problem:
faculty politics," Jackson said. "lAS
lias become an external fighting
ground for professors in (other] de
partments Personally, all I want is a
degree in Luin American Studies; I
don't care who offended who."
Still, there may be more explana

tions reflecting a willingness to con
solidate certain programs for ad
ministrative and financial motives oi
to discontinue all area studies, favor
ing traditional departments with
strict methodologies.
"It is really a basic question about
how knowledge should be orga
nized and disseminated." said Assoc.
I)irector of lAS Kathleen Mori ison.
".Area studies programs have
been under attack for some time by
social st ientists who believe thai area
studies lacks a truly 'scientific' ap
proach. that il looks at cases in great
depth but cannot produce any evi
dence that is generalizable," Morri
son said. "These tensions exist not
just al Stanford but at universities
throughout the country â€” principal
ly at the'elite research universities."
"Students need to know that
African .Studies, Fast Asian Studies
and Americ an Studies are all facing
similar reviews and are at risk of

being terminated 111 the neat future
as well, Jackson said.
(iregg emphasized that all acade
tni< programs at Stanford could
benefit from critical reviews and im
provement on <1 regular basis.
"Apian of serious reviews tan and
ought to have the possible result of
ending or requiring the refashion
ing of a program, and this has hap
pened in this case," (>t egg said.
In spite of the administration's
decisions, the department has taken
a few steps toward being reconstitut
ed. Anthropolog) Prof. Jim Pox has
also been appointed new lAS direc
tor and has committed to re
strengthening the program.
"[Fox| joins the mail) Stanford
students and facult) ... in wanting
to re-imagine and re-tool these de
gree programs, making them supe
rior academic opportunities for
those who wish to c hoose them,"
(Ireirtr said.
