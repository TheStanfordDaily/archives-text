# Greek groups focus on service
## Fraternities, sororities take pride in local community projects 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When undergraduates think of
(ireek life on the Stanford campus,
the image that comes to mind may
be more likely to involve wild, alco
hol-drenched parties than build
ing houses for the homeless.
Yet the University is actually full
of Greek organizations that pride
themselves on contributing to their
communities through philan
thropic as well as social activities.
"Most people do not realize
how important community service
is to the Greek system," said junior
Sara Flores, outgoing philan
thropy chair of the Delta Delta
Del tii sorority.
Members of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity echoed this sentiment.

"Over the past couple of years,
the house has been in a period of
transition where we have been try
ing to set new goals and re-work
the house's image," said senior
Jamie Potter, Kappa Sig's commu
nity service chair.
He pointed to the chapter's
Change Drive to Feed the Home
less, which raised $1,000 in change
to fund the brothers in cooking
and serving breakfast to the home
less in Palo Alto every Tuesday.
" This project so far has been
very rewarding, and I hope it be
comes a tradition that the chapter
will continue," Potter said.
Usually, individual chapters
sponsor and produce their own
community service events as op
posed to working with other or
ganizations as a unified Greek
community.
"Part of the challenge of my job
as the Inter-Fraternity Council
community service head is to moti
vate distinct chapters to come to
gether to do work for which they

receive little recognition as a chap
ter," said senior Thomas Clark Du
rant, pledge educator for the
Kappa Alpha fraternity. "It is diffi
cult, because most Greeks identify
much more with their individual
chapters than with the Greek com
munity as a whole."
"Most chapters, KA among
them, do community service sever
al times a quarter, but this work is
coordinated by the community ser
vice heads of the individual chap
ters," Durant said.
One upcoming event of note is
( .hi Omega and Sigma Nil's Fire
and Ice Ball, which will benefit The
Greater Bay Area Make-A-Wish
Foundation, a charity that grants
the expressed wishes of children
with terminal illnesses.
"It feels great to be able to give
back to the community and pro
vide the means for wishes to come
true," said senior Sylvia Bereknyei,
president of Chi Omega.
"Chi Omega's foundations are
formed on community service. We
hold various philanthropic events
each quarter, either by promoting
events or through participation,"
Bereknyei said. "Our members are
also very much involved in com
munity service as their extra-cur
ricular activities, and [that is ]
something that we take pride in."
According to junior Yoshio
Osaki, community service repre
sentative for Sigma Nu, "One of
the goals for this past year . . . was
getting more involved with young
people."
To this end, the fraternity also
co-sponsored a Valentine Card-
Making Party with the Delta Delta
Delta sorority this week for the Lu
cile Packard Ghildren's 1 fospital.
"This event is not only a great
way to do something for our
youth, but also to spread aware
ness about the need to help the Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital,"
Osaki said.
Stanford Tridelts also hold an
annual charity auction that has
raised over $50,000 for the
Packard Hospital over the years.
