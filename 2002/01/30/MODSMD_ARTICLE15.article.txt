# Athletes face admissions hurdles
## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK STAFF WRITER 
As a seven-time winner of the
prestigious Sears Directors' (lup,
Stanford maintains its reputation
lor excellence in athletics as well
as in academics through a unique
system of recruiting, admissions
and financial aid.
"[The Department of Athlet
ics] attempts to find the finest
student athletes in the country
who wish to compete at the
highest level, both in the class
room and in his or her sport,"
said Asst. Athletics Director
Gary Migdol. "It's a tremen
dous effort on the part of our
staff to identify these athletes."
Athletic recruiting begins with
the coaches, who survey the
country's top high school athletes
and create a list of the students
they would like to pursue, l hey
send these names to the ()flice of
Undergraduate Admissions,
where Joan Lippman, an associ
ate dean in the Admissions ()Hi< e
and liaison to the Athletics De
partment. checks the students'
academic records.
At this stage of the process, she
makes sure these prospective ap
plicants have test scores and
grade point averages high
enough to compete with the rest
of the Stanford applicant pool.
Many recruits are discour
aged from applving at this stage
because their academic achieve
ments are not strong enough to
gain them admission to Stanford.
"I see every single recruited
athlete's file," Lippman said.
"[The Admissions ()ffice] keeps
disappointing our coaches who
have gotten some top recruits.
They have to keep going back
and finding the student athlete
who is ;i student before being an
athlete."
Lippman said she feels that
this frequently-cited idea of the
"student athlete" is what ulti

mately drives the admissions
process. "We always consider
what faculty are going to think of
the students in the classroom,"
she said. "I'm thrilled with the in
tegrity we have in [the Admission
Department]; we admire all
kinds of excellence at Stanford."
Once the coaches receive
Lippman's short list, they begin
recruiting these students in
earnest. The students must com
plete the same application as the
rest of the applicants, although
their files are not necessarily read
on the same time frame. I he ath
letics admission process follows
the timetable of the National Let
ter of Intent, which has two sign
ing <Lite's, one in November and
one in February.
Lippman said that her staff
reviews about 200 files in early
fall lor the November signing
elate, before the early admission
applications are due. Those ath
letes accepted in this round
must keep their grades at an ac
ceptable level during the first
semester of their senior years.
Athletes whose sports use the

February signing date submit
their applications for at the
same time as the regular admis
sions candidates and are re
viewed with this applicant pool.
According to Dean of Admis
sions Robin Mainlet, the admis
sion rate for athletes has not
i hanged significantly over the
past five years.
"The number of recruited
athletes coming to Stanford has
been quite stable," she said.
"The standards for admitting
student athletes have not
changed over the past few years.
We are fortunate to be able to
attract an extraordinary group
of student athletes."
In addition to undergoing this
unique acceptance process, ath
letes are the only group of stu
dents at Stanford to receive
merit-based aid, rather than
need-based aid. According to
Karen Peters, a student services
associate in the Athletics Depart
ment, t he coaches are given a cer
tain number of "full-ride" schol

arships depending on the team.
She said that this money covers the
expenses for tuition, room and
board, books and fees.
" There's no real application
process^for these beyond the coach
offering these scholarships to the
student," Peters said. "When they
sign their Letter of Intent saying
they'll attend Stanford, they also
accept the scholarship."
The number of these scholar

ships allowable per team is fixed
by NCAA standards. Football
has the most with 85 for the
team; other sports have fewer
scholarships to offer, with 13 for
men's basketball and about 12
for baseball. The money for
these athletic scholarships
comes from donors who give di
rectly to the athletic depart
ment; money is not taken out of
the funds used for other stu
dents' need-based aid.
Last year, the Athletics Depart
ment awarded over $8 million in
aid to its athletes, with an average
award of $25,263.

for baseball. The money for
these athletic scholarships
comes from donors who give di
rectly to the athletic depart
ment; money is not taken out of
the funds used for other stu
dents' need-based aid.
Last year, the Athletics Depart
ment awarded over $8 million in
aid to its athletes, with an average
award of $25,263.
As a seven-time winner of the
prestigious Sears Directors' (lup,
Stanford maintains its reputation
lor excellence in athletics as well
as in academics through a unique
system of recruiting, admissions
and financial aid.
"[The Department of Athlet
ics] attempts to find the finest
student athletes in the country
who wish to compete at the
highest level, both in the class
room and in his or her sport,"
said Asst. Athletics Director
Gary Migdol. "It's a tremen
dous effort on the part of our
staff to identify these athletes."
Athletic recruiting begins with
the coaches, who survey the
country's top high school athletes
and create a list of the students
they would like to pursue, l hey
send these names to the ()flice of
Undergraduate Admissions,
where Joan Lippman, an associ
ate dean in the Admissions ()Hi< e
and liaison to the Athletics De
partment. checks the students'
academic records.
At this stage of the process, she
makes sure these prospective ap
plicants have test scores and
grade point averages high
enough to compete with the rest
of the Stanford applicant pool.
Many recruits are discour
aged from applving at this stage
because their academic achieve
ments are not strong enough to
gain them admission to Stanford.
"I see every single recruited
athlete's file," Lippman said.
"[The Admissions ()ffice] keeps
disappointing our coaches who
have gotten some top recruits.
They have to keep going back
and finding the student athlete
who is ;i student before being an
athlete."
Lippman said she feels that
this frequently-cited idea of the
"student athlete" is what ulti

mately drives the admissions
process. "We always consider
what faculty are going to think of
the students in the classroom,"
she said. "I'm thrilled with the in
tegrity we have in [the Admission
Department]; we admire all
kinds of excellence at Stanford."
Once the coaches receive
Lippman's short list, they begin
recruiting these students in
earnest. The students must com
plete the same application as the
rest of the applicants, although
their files are not necessarily read
on the same time frame. I he ath
letics admission process follows
the timetable of the National Let
ter of Intent, which has two sign
ing <Lite's, one in November and
one in February.
Lippman said that her staff
reviews about 200 files in early
fall lor the November signing
elate, before the early admission
applications are due. Those ath
letes accepted in this round
must keep their grades at an ac
ceptable level during the first
semester of their senior years.
Athletes whose sports use the

February signing date submit
their applications for at the
same time as the regular admis
sions candidates and are re
viewed with this applicant pool.
According to Dean of Admis
sions Robin Mainlet, the admis
sion rate for athletes has not
i hanged significantly over the
past five years.
"The number of recruited
athletes coming to Stanford has
been quite stable," she said.
"The standards for admitting
student athletes have not
changed over the past few years.
We are fortunate to be able to
attract an extraordinary group
of student athletes."
In addition to undergoing this
unique acceptance process, ath
letes are the only group of stu
dents at Stanford to receive
merit-based aid, rather than
need-based aid. According to
Karen Peters, a student services
associate in the Athletics Depart
ment, t he coaches are given a cer
tain number of "full-ride" schol

arships depending on the team.
She said that this money covers the
expenses for tuition, room and
board, books and fees.
" There's no real application
process^for these beyond the coach
offering these scholarships to the
student," Peters said. "When they
sign their Letter of Intent saying
they'll attend Stanford, they also
accept the scholarship."
The number of these scholar

ships allowable per team is fixed
by NCAA standards. Football
has the most with 85 for the
team; other sports have fewer
scholarships to offer, with 13 for
men's basketball and about 12
for baseball. The money for
these athletic scholarships
comes from donors who give di
rectly to the athletic depart
ment; money is not taken out of
the funds used for other stu
dents' need-based aid.
Last year, the Athletics Depart
ment awarded over $8 million in
aid to its athletes, with an average
award of $25,263.
