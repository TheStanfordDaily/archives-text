## The 						Stanford Daily Student athletes deserve special considerations

Sf anford student athletes are sortie of the
best in the country. Our teams are pere
nially ranked at the top of national polls.

•inblematic of the best college athletics program
n the nation. With all this success, Stanford ath
etics have assumed a central role in the Univer
iity's public image and its atmosphere, a symbol

From the outside. Stanford athletics and aca
lemics appear to have formed a happy mar
iage.but the truth isn't quite so simple. Ourath
etic program does not inherently complement

hough seldom outwardly manifested, tension
jet ween these two major facets of our university.
I here is a common perception that athletics cle
rat t from academic pursuits and that athletes at
Stanford are less than qualified for the intellec
ual rigors our school requires. Professors often

resent that they are forced to compete for
athletes' time with their coaches and sport
ing events. These impressions stem from
the fact that the Stanford athletic program is
incredibly demanding and time intensive,
but also from the fact that athletes at Stan
ford are considered differently in the ad
missions process.
Stanford strives to ensure that the term "stu
dent athlete" really does retain its meaning.
Compared with the rest of Division I schools, it
has succeeded admirably. However, this does
not mean that Stanford athletes are, at least,
statistically, held to the same standards as the
rest of the student body, and this inevitably
causes controversy. Stanford Magazine did a
piece on the athletic program in their Nov./
Dec. issue, reporting that between 1994 and
1997, Stanford male athletes averaged a 1215
on their SAT, while female athletes averaged
1151. While these scores were 2IS and 144
above the national average, respectively, they
are still drastically lower than the average for

an entering class of Stanford freshman, such as
the class of 2004, in which approximately 75
percent of students had a 1400 or above on
their SAT
While test scores and grades create a sort of
concrete standard in the college admissions,
the process remains highly subjective. The
question is. how much should athletic accom
plishments matter in the admissions process
as compared to other accomplishments?
With so many more qualified applicants
than spaces, some understandably question
different admissions standards for athletes.
However, Stanford athletics create a
unique environment at our school that is
found only at few other schools in the nation.
Not only do athletics provide an outlet for
the students actually participating in them,
but sporting events create a source of unity
and pride for the entire student body and
even alumni. Thus, student athletes serve a
special and important function at our school
that can not be measured in terms of num

bers or scores.
Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet recent
ly told The Daily that, "the standards for ad
mitting student athletes have not changed
over the past few years." However, recent
grumblings from some athfetic teams, which
struggle to bring in recruits, suggest that the
bar for academic criteria has been raised
higher than it has been in past years.
At this point, such assertions are all spec
ulation. Without sufficient data, they
should be treated as such.
The vast majority of our student-athletes
are serious about their studies. Stanford
athletes' remarkable rate of athlete gradua
tion and general record of academic in
tegrity as compared to other major Division
1 programs are particularly impressive.
While Stanford should continue to be rig
orous in its admissions process, the stan
dards for athletes that have been in place
seem effective in maximizing both our aca
demic and athletic prowess.

special and important function at our school
that can not be measured in terms of num

bers or scores.
Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet recent
ly told The Daily that, "the standards for ad
mitting student athletes have not changed
over the past few years." However, recent
grumblings from some athfetic teams, which
struggle to bring in recruits, suggest that the
bar for academic criteria has been raised
higher than it has been in past years.
At this point, such assertions are all spec
ulation. Without sufficient data, they
should be treated as such.
The vast majority of our student-athletes
are serious about their studies. Stanford
athletes' remarkable rate of athlete gradua
tion and general record of academic in
tegrity as compared to other major Division
1 programs are particularly impressive.
While Stanford should continue to be rig
orous in its admissions process, the stan
dards for athletes that have been in place
seem effective in maximizing both our aca
demic and athletic prowess.
