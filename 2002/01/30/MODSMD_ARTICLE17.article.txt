## Go home, young 'uns! 
### 
Once upon a time, the slogan tor
iliis country was "go west,
young man!" Our very exis
tence at Stanford is the result of
a western rush for gold, timber and land.
Railroads, like those constructed bv Gov.
Stanford, carried people and goods to the
far reaches of the west until our "Manifest
Destim" was complete. San Francisco
sprung up from nothing in 1849. At the
same time, small towns like nearby Occi
dental were settled by Kuropean immi
grants working for sawmills and the rail
road. I'hat was then.
I his is now. In today's world, we need a
new slogan: "go home, young 'un." ('I n is
a gender-neutral term used in the Blue
Ridge Mountains of Virginia by people like
my grandfather). The best and the bright-

est from Stanford, and
other elite universities,
should return to the
hometowns from which
they came. They should
go back to small towns
and cities in the Midwest,
the South, the Northeast
and the Mid-Atlantic
rather than settling into
anonvmit\ within San

Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C.
and other major cities. I hey should be
come big fish in small ponds.
Stanford students have the potential to
become civic leaders in politics, business
and literature within small towns and
medium-sized cities. Look where success
ful politic ians got started: (ieorge W. Bush
in Midland, Texas; Dick Cheney in
Wyoming; Bill Clinton in Little Rock,
Arkansas; Janet Reno in Miami, Florida;
Wood row Wilson iti Princeton, N.J. Only
three American presidents came straight
from the U.S. Congress. I he rest were
home-grc >wn.
Look at the greatest writers: F. Scott
Fit/gerald in lowson, Maryland; Mark
I wain in Missouri; Maya Angelou in
North Carolina. Look at the biggest In
ternet CFOs: Jeff Bezos and Bill (fates in
Seattle. I hese are just a few examples.
I he real path is yours to follow and these
former succ esses are more like "iiuminar
ios (candles in bags used to celebrate
Christmas in the Southwest and Mexico)
which illuminate the way to your own fu
ture. I fere are five reasons for you to "go
home, young 'un."
First, life- is better outside big c ities such
as New York, Boston, Washington. D.C.,
San Franc isc o and Los Angeles. Living ex
penses are much cheaper. You can live in a
house with a yard surrounded by trees
rather than in a small rat-hole within a
majoi city that has four trees per square
block. In addition, you will find less traffic,
smaller commuting time, lower costs of liv
ing, less pollution, more civility, better
manners, less crime and stronger commu
nity. All in all, you will l>c happier in a small

town or medium-sized city.
Second, you will have a stronger impact.
Neighbors will admire you as a Stanford
graduate â€” one of the few who returned
home from a fancy school. You will hobnob
with the community's top leadership
rather than reading about them in the
front page of a big c ity newspaper. You'll
be sought out for advice, friendship and
civic service. People will know you by
name. Forget about the anonymity ofa big
citv where people take your money, give
you change and don't count on seeing you
ever again.
I bird, you'll find better work. Leave be
hind the cubicles of Silicon Valley and the
open-floor seating of New York City in
vestment banks. Find a real office in a small
town with beautiful places for lunch. Fur
thermore, you'll be able to start your own
business more easily in a small town. Fhe
town of Fries, VA, for example, was devel
oped on the foundation of a cotton mill
that employed many residents. Fhe mill
has shut clown. 1 here's no reason why a
new Internet company couldn't takeover
the old cotton mill and recruit workers
from the United States, India and else
where to work in a new technology start
up. Local government would probably
bend over backwards to help you set up
shop.
Fourth, it's your c ivic duty. I his duty
was vividly described by the Allegoiy of the
(lave in Plato's Republic. I lie Vllegory says
most people live in an "underground
den." Only the rare person ascends into
the sunlight (or to Stanford) for an educa
tion which provides "clearer vision." It's
not easy. Plato acknowledges that looking
towards the "light" (his metaphor for
truth) causes "sharp pains." Fhe end result
is nothing less than an "ascent of the soul
into the intellectual world." I lopefully, this
is what you are doing at the University.
In Plato's Republic, the- wise would
rather stay in the sunlight and live among
their peers. However, they are required
to go back into the darkness of the (lave to
become "benefactors of one another."
Some modern critics argue the Republic
is a fascist model with little room for
choice. Clearly, we would not (and could
not) require Ivy League and Stanford
graduates to return to their hometowns.
Nevertheless, duty still calls for those who
are willing to listen. Small towns and
medium-sized cities would be better
places under the influence of students
who've seen the light (Columbia's motto:
In thy light, we see light) and returned
home to share their education.
Unfortunately, most students never re
turn home. Many Stanford graduates re
main on the West (loast. Nearly 75 percent
of Columbia graduates remain in New
York City despite the fact they come from
all 50 states. Most Oxford students accept
