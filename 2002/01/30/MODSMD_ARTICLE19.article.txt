Junior criticizes Walker editorial
The editorial published in the Jan. 28
Daily, "Walker deliberately endangered
American lives." is an attempt to convict a
man in the media without first hearing the
evidence of the case. The article supports
vague c harges made by the government
and summarily dismisses reasonable
claims about Walker s allegiances made In
his lawyer and family. Finally, the editori
al fails to draw on a fundamental distinc
tion that most of the American public, in
the throes ol jingoistic fervor, glosses over,
namely the difference between tlu- l al
iban and Al-Qaeda.
John Walker Lindti will stand trial in
federal court for allegedly "conspiring to
kill Americans." A jury of his peers, or
more likely, a judge, will ultimately cle< ide
whether he is guilty of these hazy charges.
It hardly seems ethic al fora newspaper to
determine his guilt, only days after the ar
raignment, which itself was held clays late
in violation of Walker's rights. Instead, the
article reads as if the editors are afraid that
the case might weaken the 'morale' of a
judge or jury, inducing them to let Walk
er ofl. I bis indeed would be a damaging
blow to the United States patriotic crusade
against 'evil,' which among other things
seems to include disregarding civil tights
and ignoring the Cieneva Convention.
Among the arguments made by Walk
er's party in his defense, and dismissed by
the aforementioned editorial, is the notion
that Walker did not goto Afghanistan with
the idea of hurting Americans. I do not
pretend to know the mind of John Walker
when he went to Yemen, or from there to
Pakistan or on to Afghanistan. However,
considering that U.S. involvement in
Afghanistan ended with the Soviet with
drawal in 1980, leaving the nation to more

ill.in a decade of c ivil war, ii seems reason
able to ai least allow the possibility that
Walker was not going there to 'deliberate
ly endanger American lives," but felt him
self to be completely out of the American
sphere of interest.
1 lis accusers get around this by saying
that .is a fighter with Al-Qaeda and the
Taliban, he must have known that he
would be fighting against America. But as
even the editorial admits, Walker could
not have known about Sept. 11, as it seems
that only top officials were informed. Cer
tainly no one thought to inform a 20-year
old American about the plot. It goes with
out saying that without Sept. 11, there
would not suddenly have been a 'moral'
crusade to make the world safe from ter
ror. More importantly, while there are
certainly links between Al-Qaeda and the
l aliban, logic would dictate that the gulf is
wide between a soldier of a government in
a civil war-torn country, and an interna
tional terrorist organization of which no
one has plausibly shown that Walker was
an agent. I o any charges that Walker was
responsible for Mike Spann's death, all ev
idence thus fin has been to the contrary,
that Walker was one of hundreds of pris
oners not responsible.
Lastly, whatever Walker's feelings
about Americ a, are we really so self-righ
teous to assert that because he was born an
American that we intend to hold him as
one for life? Clearly, Walker chose mem
iHTship in the Pan-Islamic world, which
despite current sentiment is not nec essari
ly antagonistic towards the United States,
over life in America. I here was no bureau
in Afghanistan for him to go to make this
official, and so America now intends to
c rucify him on the cross of its injured ado
lescent sense of invulnerability. I may be
wrong, and Walker may have been a close

confidante of Osama bin Laden's, but
until that is proven in a court of law, it is
unfair and unjust for the media to specu
late wildly, straying so far from fact and
reasonable inference.

SCN Directors defend ticket distribution
As an organization, we are sorry that
such bad opinions of the Stanford Con
cert Network exist and that everyone
who wanted tic kets to the Jack Johnson
show next month was not able to receive
them. We value the experiences and
opinions that were expressed, and be as
sured that we will re-evaluate our ticket
policies for our next show. But what the
SCN does not value is the accusatory and
inaccurate manner with which these
opinions were expressed.
To begin with, the title of the letter in
yesterday's Daily was "SCN botches Jack
Johnson concert," but before the concert
in question was even addressed, shows we
did two to three years ago were insulted.
While all may not appreciate some of the
shows that the SCN chooses to bring to
campus, one person's taste does not rep
resent the diversified tastes of all Stanford
students. Moreover, of the shows we have
put on in recent years, we have sold out
shows repeatedly: Ihe Roots, Vertical
Horizon with Nine Days, Dar Williams,
Politically Incorrect with Kill Maher, Dis
patch and now Jack Johnson.
We must also address the dubbing of
the Jack Johnson show as the "Big Decent
Show of the Year." While everyone on
staff is very excited about the upcoming
