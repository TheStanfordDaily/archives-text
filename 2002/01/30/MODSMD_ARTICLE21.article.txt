# Aloha: Hawaii club aims to spread awareness
## 
### NAOMI ULLIAN 
In the second week of May, approximate
ly 500 gyrating students and Bay Area locals
will descend upon Manzanita court to roast
pigs and slurp squid.
Don't worry â€” it's just a luau.
The Hawaii Club's biggest event, the
Stanford luau will feature music of the
ukulele, foods like squid stew and coconut
pudding and the native dances of Hawaii,
Tahiti and New Zealand.
"We want to share not only Hawaiian local
culture but also Polynesian culture," said ju
nior Amanda Rang, Hawaii Club co-president.
Founded in the 19705, the Hawaii Club
was intended to provide a support structure
and an atmosphere for students from 1 lawaii
to practice local culture. Today Stanford has
about 120 undergraduates who call Hawaii
home. Rang estimates that about 40 of those
students are active in the Hawaii club, and
SO will participate in the Luau.
Although the Hawaii Club is best known
for the luau, Rang says, this year the club is
attempting to branch out.
"The spirit of local native culture is about
sharing," said Rang, who also noted that the
blend of Hawaiian culture includes native

Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Ko
rean and Portuguese.
Lee noted that alt hough not all club mem
bers are Hawaiian natives, all but one grew
up in I lawaii.
" The plantations were really what drew
so many ethnic groups to the islands," Lee
explained.
In the attempt to spread awareness
about Hawaiian culture this year, Rang
helped arrange lor Hawaiian language
classes to be offered on campus through
the Special Language program. Fourteen
students participated in Beginning Hawai
ian first quarter, and 1 I are continuing
their study through winter quarter.
Rang also helped sponsor two classes for
winter quarter through the Hawaii Club.
"Beyond Paradise: Contemporary Native
Hawaiian Issues" will include Native
Hawaiian guest speakers from the Bay
Area, while "'Onipa'a will be discussing is
sues of Native Hawaiian sovereignty and
will be culminating in an Alternative Spring
Break flip to the islands themselves.
In addition, the Hub also hosts social
events and is currently planning a retreat to
Santa Cruz in Februarv. Rang adds that non-
Hawaiian-born students are welcome as

well.
For those unfamiliar with Hawaiian cul
ture, however, the best place to learn will be
the Luau. Ihe dub begins real planning at
(he end of autumn quarter, when they ad
vertise lor dancers to participate in the
Luau.
No experience is needed, and, under the
Guidance of a Kumu teacher brought in
from San Francisco, the dancers practice
once a week throughout winter quarter,
learning both Kahiko (traditional) and
Auana (contemporary) dancing styles.
Last year's dancers were invited to dance
in the Native American Center's annual
Powwow, which is one of the biggest Pow
wow events in the United States.
"It was a very big honor," Rang said.
This year's Luau theme is Na Pua O
Hawaii, which means "The Flowers of
Hawaii," so attendees should expect blight
colors and the stunning beauty of garlands
and tropical flowers shipped especially
from the islands.
Iu addition to dancing, Hawaiian live
music will also be featured under the di
rection of Patrick Landeza, a Hawaiian
slat-key guitarist who will also emcee the
show.
