# Education bill averts federal student-loan crisis
## 
### ERIKKA INNES 
Thanks to a bill passed by the House of
Representatives last Thursday, a potentially
major crisis in the federal Stafford loan pro
gram will likely be averted.
The need for the bill, which is scheduled
to take effect in 2006, arose from a change in
the formula used to set interest rates on
Stafford student loans. While beneficial to
borrowers, the formula change was opposed
by lenders, who argued that it would drasti
cally lower their profits on student loans.
The loss in revenue due to the change
was to be so great that many lenders said
they would be forced to stop supporting the
guaranteed student-loan program if a solu
tion was not provided. Lenders and borrow
ers alike wanted to avoid this possibility, be
cause it meant that fewer loans could be pro

vided to needy students wishing to attend
college.
The new bill, which proposes a fixed in
terest rate for student loans, will benefit
both student borrowers and lenders.
Previously, the formula for setting inter
est rates on student loans varied with mar
ket conditions. Now, lenders must maintain
a 6.8 percent interest rate for student bor
rowers. If a condition arises where lenders
are forced to ask for more, the government
pays the lenders the difference.
Cynthia Hartley, director of student
awards in the Financial Aid Office, said she
was pleased with the new bill.
"It's heartening to see the government
plans a reduc ed and fixed interest rate on the
federal Stafford loans, which many Stanford
students use to help pay for their educations."
Many student lobbyists also approve of

the bill, because they believe it approxi
mates the low interest rate that borrowers
would have received from the previous
setup.
Senior Kristin latum said she believes
that most college students will like the ef
fects of the new bill.
"All students like low interest rates," she
said.
Senior Leah Goodman said she thought
the bill would "make it easier for people who
have trouble financing their education to
come to Stanford."
Goodman added that the bill might have
more effect "on schools without need-blind
policies, because they would be able to ac
cept more students from disadvantaged eco
nomic backgrounds."
Currently, the House and Senate await
President Bush's signature to the bill.
