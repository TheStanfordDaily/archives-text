## Ginseng, ginkgo, guarana — what's the difference? 
### JEN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Q: Answer Girl, I was over at Lag lor
Nite" last week, and I wanted to
grab something to drink. When I looked,
all of the drinks had ginseng, ginkgo,
echinacea, guarana and even natural
Melissa extract (that one scares me a little
bit). Honestly, it was a little overwhelm
ing. What's the deal? Do these things ac
tually work? Which one should I go for?
A: I know what von mean. It seems as
though even new product on the market
tries to take advantage ol society's health
consciousness, but can vou really believe
their claims?
For example, Sobe claims to be the bev
erage that "energizes the body, uplilts the

spirit, and enlightens the mind." If one
bottle ol Mac l.i/ard Lemonade can do all
that, who needs the gym?
I lere's a quick run-down on some com
mon and not-so-common ingredients that
supposedly super-charge your beverages.
Ginseng. Most experts will say that
ginseng works by stimulating sec ret ions
of the endocrine system. Since the en
docrine system ties into even other
bodil\ system, ginseng's effects can be
wide-ranging. Some tests have shown
ginseng to be responsible for normaliz
ing blood sugars, stimulating immune
function and even treating male impo
tence. It is possible that ginseng allows
tells to more readily use stored sugars,
which enable red blood cells to carry
more oxygen. Gingseng plant chemicals
called ginsenosides are thought to be

responsible. However, clinical research
011 ginseng's effectiveness has delivered
mixed results.
Ginkgo Biloba. Ginkgo has been
shown to affect tlie vascular system by in
creasing the flow of blood to the brain and
lower extremities. This increased blood
flow to the brain is thought to improve
memory and relieve signs of senility. It
also helps prevent blood clots and has
been used quite successfully for problems
related to poor circulation.
Echinacea. Echinacea is a popular herb
used primarily to reduce the symptoms
and duration of colds and flu-like illnesses.
It is believed to work through short-term
stimulation of the immune system. Re
cently, numerous studies and research
have shown that foremost among the
plant's medicinal benefits is its effective

ness in boosting the body's immunity
against viral, fungal and bacterial infec
tions. It achieves this by stimulating the
mucous membranes, liver and lymph
nodes. Be advised that Echinacea should
not be taken for long periods of time, be
cause the herb can over-stimulate the im
mune system.
Guarana. Guarana contains tetra
methylxanthine, a compound almost
identical to caffeine. It also contains large
amounts of theophylline, theobromine,
tannic acid and saponins. The compound
is released slowly — up to six hours — so
the energy boost that is experienced from
guarana is not exactly like the boost from
coffee. The tannic acid is an astringent,
which probably accounts for its use as a di
gestive tonic, or appetite suppressant.
Theobromine is the euphoriant craved by

chocoholics.
Melissa extract. Yes, it is a real herb. It is
most often used as a mild sedative to relieve
insomnia and anxiety. It is also used as an
antispasmodic to treat intestinal colic and
menstrual cramps. Externally, it is applied
to wounds as an antimicrobial agent. It is
also used as an antiviral agent against the
herpes simplex virus.
There is proof that all of these natural
ingredients can doa body good. But for all
of those positive studies, there are an equal
number that question the effectiveness of
such herbs. So it's up to you to decide if
you want to test claims such as Snapple El
ements' drink, "Velocity," which suppos
edly will "give you the energy to get home
before your girlfriend, boyfriend, or what
ever. even though you've been out with
someone new." Good luck with that one.
