Cardiac problems are the leading
cause of death among Americans. (>vcr
half-a-million bypass surgeries are per
formed in the I'.S. every year. A study
from Duke I niversitx has found, however,
that what is good lor the heart ma\ not be
good for the head. Reseat hers found that a
third of the patients are at increased risk of
cognitive decline due to the effects of heart
surgen. Doctors have stressed this is no ex
cuse to avoid a necessar) surgerv. Wh\ the
mental togginessocc ins is not dear yet, but
the problem is more common among
older, less educated patients, which sug
gests that other reasons mav be at plav.
The cart(K)n Popeyewas invented in the
1940s as a means to encourage children to
eatspinach. Ys kids, out grandmothers also
told us that spinach strengthened our eyes,
which is true since it prevents macular de

generation, the leading cause of blindness.
If \<>u were never realh convinced, here is
one more reason: spinach is loaded with
iron and folate, a B vitamin. Folate lowers
blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid
that irritates blood vessels and is linked to
heart disease. If you are still trvingtofind an
excuse, this ones for you: one cup of
spinach contains onl\ 11 calories and no fat.
Manzanita Dining, bring on those leaves.

There are 80,000 people in the U.S.
alone waiting for an organ transplant and
5,000 die each year without receiving one.
Mail) scientists have been looking into
xenotransplantation (transplanting organs
from animals to humans) as an alternative,
but differences in immune system usually
cause rejection. A positive development
happened earlier this month, when re

searchers from 1 MM . Therapeutics (the same
guvs who c loned Dolly), University of Mis
souri and Immerge Bio 1 herapeutics
cloned piglets lacking most of their immune
system, transplanting organs from these
animals would theoretic ally avoid rejection.
I'lie danger is that the organ would carry
deadly diseases, which would lx- neutralized
in a healthy pig, to the recipient. Re
searc hers predict it will be a decade or more
before clinical trials become routine and
even longer lor transplants.

Have you ever wondered how DVDs
and CDs have the same size and look but
are so different in terms of data storage?
The reason is verticalization. CDs have only
one layer able to hold data whereas DVDs
have multiple layers, allowing them to store

much more — and better — audio / video.
The same principle applies to microchips.
In the 1980s, silicon wafers were etched in a
mostly left-right manner, givinga 21) struc
ture. lu the 19905, manufacturers also
began etching cells on one another, creat
ing a 3D structure with much larger pro
cessing power. An average microcircuit is a
stack of eight memory cells on top of each
other. Hail microtechnology!
Inspired by one-celled organisms
that dwell in the sea, Nekton Research
has produced mini submarines that are
barely the size of your pinky finger. The
hots weigh 70 grams, can turn around
the diameter of a dime and achieve
speeds of up to three knots. The pur
pose? To scour the seas and tight spaces
to collect data. The inventors at Nekton
are still investigating how to discourage
fish from eating their prized submarines.
Nonetheless, they hope that such robots
might carry sensors for environmental
monitoring or defense.
The Andromeda Strain redux? Last
year, Australian scientists working with
DNA added a single gene to a mostly
harmless mousepox virus. The virus quick
ly become a terrifying killer, and in less
than 10 days all the lab mice were dead.
The lab was especially concerned that an
accidental discovery could create a virus
that attacks human beings.
