# Hurlbut offers insights as member of council
## 
### CAROLINE MOORE-KOCHLACS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
William H. llurlbut, M.D.. is a consult
ing professor in the Program in Human
Biology. He has taught at Stanford for 12
years. He was recently appointed to serve
on The President's ('.onmil on Bioethics,
which had its first meeting in Washington
I)C on /an. 17.
Could you briefly describe the pur
pose of The President's Council on
Bioethics?
The Counc il has a broad mandate.
I he immediate concern is the impasse
over stem cells and cloning, but our
charge is to look at the full range of
biotechnology and to advise the Presi
dent on what seems to be the wise path
forward. Also, we are asked to help set
the terms of discourse and modes of in
quiry . and to educate and stimulate the
nation to a broader public deliberation
on these issues. When we met with the
President on Thursday last week, he re
iterated that he was not seeking consen
sus from our group but a constructive,
open dialogue with varied opinions ex
pressed. I le told us we could help serve
as the consc icnc e of the country.
With foreign policy and the reces
sion Bush's top [priorities], how much
attention will he give to this council?
As I listened to him. I sensed that he
had a strong feeling for the importance
of the work of the Council. He said that
these issues went beyond any one presi
dency or any one generation, lie also
said that he docs not know more about
biotechnology than most Americans do
and recognizes that he is in need ofwell
informed guidance on these matters. I
had the feeling that he was genuinely
open to the possibility that there might
Ik- considerations that he had not vet

heard or accommodated in his policy po
sitions.
And what affect will this council have
on policy?
We will not have any direct power to
make policy decisions and, I think, be
cause of that we may have a deeper and
more long-term effect on the future. We
are asked to help frame the terms of dis
course, the ideas, attitudes and ap
proaches that go into the formulation ol
policy. We will make prudential judg
ments on the human meaning of bio
medical advance and specific recom
mendations on the proper role of the
government in encouraging,* funding
and regulating scientific and technologi
cal innovation. And, as the President em
phasized, what America does may affect
the moral consideration and specific leg
islation in many places in the world.
Why were you chosen for this com
mittee?
When I was interviewed by the White
House staff, no one asked me who I
voted for or what the nature of my advice
would be. Apparently my nomination
came from several sources, including
colleagues in the sciences and in
bioethics. I have an uncommon back
ground, having been trained in both
medicine and theology. I helped set up
Stanford Medical School's first course in
medical ethics when I was a senior med
ical student, and I have thought about
these issues every day for more than 30
years. Over these years 1 have been an
active speaker and writer in the national
and international discussion on issues in
biotechnology.
Where do you see yourself on this
committee?
Beyond contributing my own per
spectives, I hope to be of help in medi
ating understanding between the var
ied levels of discourse. So often such in

terdisciplinary committees and councils
are collections of disparate perspec
tives, of immiscible minds, unable to
find solution in a common language of
understanding. And beyond that, I'm
sorry to say that a lot of bioethical de
bate is over things that will never hap
pen. A little more scientific knowledge
could keep us from chasing ghosts. Be
cause I speak the languages and carry
the concerns of both terms of the de
bate, that is, the humanistic and scien
tific considerations, I hope to help fos
ter balance in the discussion.
How do you, as a council member,
balance your personal moral beliefs
with what should be legally enforced as
official policy?
I begin all my classes with the old say
ing, "never ask what goes into sausages
or laws." Because laws are often products
of the real-world compromise of varied
moral and practical perspectives and
pressures, they are imperfect reflections
of ethical ideals.
As a physician, I am trained in a heal
ing profession that seeks to cure disease
and alleviate suffering at the level of the
individual life; my training is not in
legal policy decision making. I will, as I
do iu all my classes, help frame the
thinking on the ideals for the fullness
and flourishing of human life and then
listen very carefully and attentively to
those who know more than I do about
translating these ideals into practical
governmental policy. I certainly believe
we should seek to distinguish what are
universal moral principles and what is
purely personal belief and try to pre
serve the broadest possible individual
and scientific freedom. One of the most
important purposes of laws in a plural
istic society is to protect the citizens
from the government itself and from
each other, but there are times we need

to be protected from our own igno
rance as well.
Where do you, or anyone else, derive
personal moral beliefs?
That's a very difficult question.
I here is broad debate on just how
moral beliefs arise and whether or not
they are simply relative to a given cul
ture. In the light of more careful con
sideration of anthropological univer
sal and an evolutionary perspective on
the development of the human mind,
we are beginning to appreciate the nat
ural groundings of moral awareness
and attitudes. As evolved and embod
ied beings, we may find some of the
foundations and beckonings of our
moral nature through a thoughtful sci
entific approach. Clearly, as a creature
that has adapted for adaptability, our
freedom, and the moral nature that
guides and governs it, are of basic bio
logical significance.
I am currently, together with Bill
Durham in anthropological sciences, co
chair of an interdisciplinary faculty pro
ject entitled, "Becoming Human: the
Evolutionary Origins of Spiritual, Reli
gious and Moral Awareness." We have as
sembled an extraordinary group of two
dozen of Stanford's leading scientists and
intellectuals to discuss these matters.
Judging from the deliberations at the first
meeting of the President's Council on
Bioethics, the discussions at Stanford
may make a contribution to the larger
policy considerations on current moral
dilemmas.
Like anyone else, my own moral beliefs
have been shaped by my basic biology, the
contours of culture and personal experi
ence. Moral reasoning is inseparable from
our sense of personal purpose and
process. Moral beliefs flow forward from
what you might call the moral imag
ination, which is a combination of
reason and emotion, intuition and
something so vague that you can
barely say what it is — just a feeling
that these beliefs form a coherent
cosmology, that these beliefs are
consistent with what you under
stand of the world.
Now, you have a theological
background as well.
I did post-doctoral studies here
at Stanford with Robert Hamer
ton-kelly.who was the Dean at
Memorial Church, then 1 studied
with the eminent French theolo
gian Louis Bouyer. I wanted to un
derstand what the Judeo-Christ
ian tradition considered the mean
ing and purpose of life, what made
a truly significant life. I wanted to
know why Anthony went into the
desert, why Francis of Assisi gave
away all of his wealth and why the
great Peruvian saint Martin de
Porres whipped his back to gain
mastery over what he saw as the
disorder of his bodily desires. 1
wanted to know what was unbal
anced and what was centrally
human about these lives and why
they were venerated in their eras.
Most specifically, I wanted to un
derstand the role of struggle, snl
fering and sacrifice because I real
ized that the uses of biotechnology
were going to come into a direct
confrontation with our ambitions
and appetites, and raise questions
concerning the purposes of
human life.
Do you follow a particular faith
tradition?
I am a Christian by background
and practice, but a Christian [in] a
broad sense of the word. 1 think of
myself as a "generic ■" (Ihristian, with
an appreciation of the Jewish roots
and die different historical expres
sions of Christianity and an open
mind to understand what 1 can
learn from other religious tradi

tions. I assume, as a given, that truth
is a unity and that the universe is an
ordered cosmos where the material
and the moral are reflections of the
same creative source.
Is there a diversity of religious
beliefs on the council?
I here is. Some are overtly reli
gious, like Stephen Carter (a Stan
ford grad), an African-American
Professor of Law from Yale who
has spoken out strongly about how
American law and politics trivialize
religious devotion. There are sev
eral Jewish members, including
committee chairman Leon Kass,
and there are clearly people who
have no formal religious beliefs, or
at least that seems evident to me
from listening to them.
How much does having a Re
publican in the White House affect
the make-up of this committee?
Leon Kass, the chair of the Coun
cil, is a man of great sincerity and in
tellectual integrity. He has assem
bled a diverse Council whose mem
bers represent a wide range of views.
Judging from the first meeting,
there will be both an earnest eflbrt
toward a thoughtful consensus and a
sharply conflicted process. Two of
the members have already dis
agreed in print with the President's
position on stem cell research.
Do you think of yourself as a
conservative?
1 don't think of myself as any
thing. I'm conservative when I
think there is something impor
tant to conserve, something that is
for one reason or another out of
fashion, neglected or obscured
within our current culture. But I
am liberal in the sense that 1 want
to preserve the widest possible per
sonal and scientific freedom. II I
am in any sense a conservative, I'm
a Northern California conserva
tive— I listen to Bob Dylan, I like
to go backpacking in the wilder
ness and 1 don't really care il
someone wants to put a ring in her
belly button.
For the past 12 years, you've
challenged students with ques
tions about where to draw the

line; now that you are in a position
of helping to draw the line, I'm
going to ask yon where you stand
on some hot topics.
First of all, let me say this, it's a lot
easier to be on the asking than the
answering side of these questions.
Clearly, these are complex,
multifaceted issues that require a
lot of thought and contemplation,
but I'm going to ask you what is
possibly the impossible: to give
me, in a few sentences, your posi
tion on a couple of questions.
What is your position con
cerning cloning for human re
production?
With regard to reproductive
cloning, as 1 lank Greely's Califor
nia Advisory Panel and Irv Weisss
man's National Academy of Sci
ence report have said, 1 believe
that it should be made illegal. I
don't normally favor governmen
tal interference in scientific and
medical matters, but this is an
arena of great human significance,
misunderstanding and deep dan
gers both medically and socially —
some people think they can resur
rect their dead children. Actually,
clones might not even look like
their genetic source, since, unlike
identical twins, they would devel
op for their first nine months in a
completely different gestational
environment.
What about "therapeutic"
cloning?
Regarding so called "therapeu
tic," or research, cloning, that is a
more difiicult moral dilemma. In
the last weeks quite a few people
have been giving me instructions
on how Tin supposed to be think
ing about this issue. 1 have re
ceived e-mails from people I don't
know from around the country
raging against the insane secular
scientists or the radical religious
right. I believe, at this stage in the
process, all the members of the
Council must listen and learn
from the most thoughtful and
constructive voices, to gain a full
appreciation of the issues and
their implications.

With therapeutic cloning, the
moral status of the early embryo
— what Leon Kass calls a vexing
question — is at issue. I want to
think more deeply about this
matter, listen carefully to all con
siderations and reflect on the
moral meaning of emerging life.
This issue will not go away just
because, for current concerns in
the harvest of stem cells, we draw
the line at 14 days. There will be
the possibility of important scien
tific knowledge to be gained by
the study of later embryological
development.
From a scientific perspective
an embryo is human, but what
are we to make of its moral sta
tus? 1 do think that some weight
should be given not just to the
actuality of the embryo, but its
potential — or rather potency
— its personhood in process.
Ideally we could find a way to
dedifferentiate adult cells back
to pluripotency but not totipo
tent-)', but here the issues of
"partial generative potential"
and "parts apart from wholes"
must be considered. And we need
to think of all the implications of
making one assumption over an
other— both the great scientific
and medical benefits and the
dangers of the instrumental use
of human life, with the possibili
ties of the manufacture, indus
trialization and commercializa
tion of human parts. Regardless
of our ultimate policy dec isions,
it is well for us to consider these
issues thoughtfully.
What is your position on in
vitro fertilization (IVF) and on em
bryonic stem cell research using
embryos recycled from IVF?
IVF has a healing motive, and
that seems to me to make the cre
ation of embryos a somewhat dif
ferent issue than the intentional
production of embryos for the
purposes of harvesting their cells.
There are many who object to the
destruction of extra IVF embryos
for the procurement of stem cells.
1 gave a talk last year to the Minis

ters of Health from Latin America,
Spain and Portugal, and after
wards the minister from Spain
came up and told me he was great
ly distressed by the Spanish law
that required him to preside over
the destruction of frozen embryos
after five years.
There are many good argu
ments on the side of the medical
benefits of obtaining these cells,
but scientific arguments alone do
not constitute moral justification.
I don't think we should make our
decision as a Council on the false
assumption that current cell
lines, or even cells from available
IVF embryos, will be adequate
for all future scientific and med
ical use. Taking cells from IVF
embryos destined for destruction
is certainly the least morally dis
turbing of the current options,
but it still leaves unrealized some
of the scientific benefits from in
tentional creation of stem cell
lines carrying genetic diseases we
would like to study. Here again, I
want to weigh the issues and see
if there might be unexplored ap
proaches that will allow moral
consensus.
Are there any bioethical issues
that you will discuss — that the com
mittee will discuss — that do not re
ceive so much public attention?
I am going to do everything 1
can to make the council aware
of the important issues implied
by advances in the neuro
sciences. 1 have taught a course
on Ethical Issues in the Neuro
sciences for nearly 10 years
now, and I am convinced that
this is the arena of the ultimate
ethical dilemmas.
There are many issues that
are to this era what genetics was
20 years ago, not yet thought of
by the general public, hut com
ing on fast. These are issues re
lated to the meaning of freedom
and responsibility, control over
personal behavior in remedia
tion or enhancement of educa
tional or athletic performance
and alteration of personality in

the treatment of mental disease.
And how much risk or change of
identity is acceptable with repair
of cognitive deficits, or what are
we to make of ablative or de
structive psychosurgeries that
actually enhance the well-being
of the patient. Beyond all these,
tht* fascinating challenges to our
sense of who we are — whether
our decisions are free, whether
our motives are what we think
they are — will themselves cre
ate ethical questions.
Do you see your membership
on this council bringing any
changes to your work at Stanford?
I will make it. together with my
teaching, my highest priority. 1
also see this as giving me new per
spectives and resouries to enhance
my teaching. Also, my classes may
serve as an extension of the delib
erations of the Council and I'll go
to ilie meetings with a more
thoughtful range of insights and
opinions.
Could you comment on your
Stanford experience?
I've been at Stanford through
my undergraduate, medical and
post-doctoral studies, and now as
a professor. I have a great affec
tion for Stanford and a deep ap
preciation of my many friend
ships among the faculty and staff.
I believe these relationships will
be an important personal re
source, and I look forward to
good conversations with col
leagues to help form my opinions
on the issues the Council will
consider.
Being appointed to a Presiden
tial Council is a big step. What are
your future goals?
My future goals are pretty
much what they've always been —
to understand the science thor
oughly, to think deeply about the
moral issues and to live my life well
personally while doing what I can
for the good of others. My hope is
that I can build on the things 1 gain
from my experience on the C Coun
cil to become a better teacher and
a better member of our society.
