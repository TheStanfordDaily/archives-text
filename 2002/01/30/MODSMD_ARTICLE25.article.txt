# Hurlbut offers insights as member of council
## 
### CAROLINE MOORE-KOCHLACS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
William H. llurlbut, M.D.. is a consult
ing professor in the Program in Human
Biology. He has taught at Stanford for 12
years. He was recently appointed to serve
on The President's ('.onmil on Bioethics,
which had its first meeting in Washington
I)C on /an. 17.
Could you briefly describe the pur
pose of The President's Council on
Bioethics?
The Counc il has a broad mandate.
I he immediate concern is the impasse
over stem cells and cloning, but our
charge is to look at the full range of
biotechnology and to advise the Presi
dent on what seems to be the wise path
forward. Also, we are asked to help set
the terms of discourse and modes of in
quiry . and to educate and stimulate the
nation to a broader public deliberation
on these issues. When we met with the
President on Thursday last week, he re
iterated that he was not seeking consen
sus from our group but a constructive,
open dialogue with varied opinions ex
pressed. I le told us we could help serve
as the consc icnc e of the country.
With foreign policy and the reces
sion Bush's top [priorities], how much
attention will he give to this council?
As I listened to him. I sensed that he
had a strong feeling for the importance
of the work of the Council. He said that
these issues went beyond any one presi
dency or any one generation, lie also
said that he docs not know more about
biotechnology than most Americans do
and recognizes that he is in need ofwell
informed guidance on these matters. I
had the feeling that he was genuinely
open to the possibility that there might
Ik- considerations that he had not vet

heard or accommodated in his policy po
sitions.
And what affect will this council have
on policy?
We will not have any direct power to
make policy decisions and, I think, be
cause of that we may have a deeper and
more long-term effect on the future. We
are asked to help frame the terms of dis
course, the ideas, attitudes and ap
proaches that go into the formulation ol
policy. We will make prudential judg
ments on the human meaning of bio
medical advance and specific recom
mendations on the proper role of the
government in encouraging,* funding
and regulating scientific and technologi
cal innovation. And, as the President em
phasized, what America does may affect
the moral consideration and specific leg
islation in many places in the world.
Why were you chosen for this com
mittee?
When I was interviewed by the White
House staff, no one asked me who I
voted for or what the nature of my advice
would be. Apparently my nomination
came from several sources, including
colleagues in the sciences and in
bioethics. I have an uncommon back
ground, having been trained in both
medicine and theology. I helped set up
Stanford Medical School's first course in
medical ethics when I was a senior med
ical student, and I have thought about
these issues every day for more than 30
years. Over these years 1 have been an
active speaker and writer in the national
and international discussion on issues in
biotechnology.
Where do you see yourself on this
committee?
Beyond contributing my own per
spectives, I hope to be of help in medi
ating understanding between the var
ied levels of discourse. So often such in

terdisciplinary committees and councils
are collections of disparate perspec
tives, of immiscible minds, unable to
find solution in a common language of
understanding. And beyond that, I'm
sorry to say that a lot of bioethical de
bate is over things that will never hap
pen. A little more scientific knowledge
could keep us from chasing ghosts. Be
cause I speak the languages and carry
the concerns of both terms of the de
bate, that is, the humanistic and scien
tific considerations, I hope to help fos
ter balance in the discussion.
How do you, as a council member,
balance your personal moral beliefs
with what should be legally enforced as
official policy?
I begin all my classes with the old say
ing, "never ask what goes into sausages
or laws." Because laws are often products
of the real-world compromise of varied
moral and practical perspectives and
pressures, they are imperfect reflections
of ethical ideals.
As a physician, I am trained in a heal
ing profession that seeks to cure disease
and alleviate suffering at the level of the
individual life; my training is not in
legal policy decision making. I will, as I
do iu all my classes, help frame the
thinking on the ideals for the fullness
and flourishing of human life and then
listen very carefully and attentively to
those who know more than I do about
translating these ideals into practical
governmental policy. I certainly believe
we should seek to distinguish what are
universal moral principles and what is
purely personal belief and try to pre
serve the broadest possible individual
and scientific freedom. One of the most
important purposes of laws in a plural
istic society is to protect the citizens
from the government itself and from
each other, but there are times we need

to be protected from our own igno
rance as well.
Where do you, or anyone else, derive
personal moral beliefs?
That's a very difficult question.
I here is broad debate on just how
moral beliefs arise and whether or not
they are simply relative to a given cul
ture. In the light of more careful con
sideration of anthropological univer
sal and an evolutionary perspective on
the development of the human mind,
we are beginning to appreciate the nat
ural groundings of moral awareness
and attitudes. As evolved and embod
ied beings, we may find some of the
foundations and beckonings of our
moral nature through a thoughtful sci
entific approach. Clearly, as a creature
that has adapted for adaptability, our
freedom, and the moral nature that
guides and governs it, are of basic bio
logical significance.
I am currently, together with Bill
Durham in anthropological sciences, co
chair of an interdisciplinary faculty pro
ject entitled, "Becoming Human: the
Evolutionary Origins of Spiritual, Reli
gious and Moral Awareness." We have as
sembled an extraordinary group of two
dozen of Stanford's leading scientists and
intellectuals to discuss these matters.
Judging from the deliberations at the first
meeting of the President's Council on
Bioethics, the discussions at Stanford
may make a contribution to the larger
policy considerations on current moral
dilemmas.
Like anyone else, my own moral beliefs
have been shaped by my basic biology, the
contours of culture and personal experi
ence. Moral reasoning is inseparable from
our sense of personal purpose and
process. Moral beliefs flow forward from
