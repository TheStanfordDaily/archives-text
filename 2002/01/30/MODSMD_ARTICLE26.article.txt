Nicholas Abbott, a chemical engineer
ing professor at the University of Wiscon
sin-Madison, and his colleagues recently
unveiled their contribution to the war
against terrorism — a wearable, coin-size
chemical sensor. The sensor, which con
sists of a thin gold film laced with micro
scopic grooves, changes color when it de
tects a toxin. Each groove contains chemi
cal receptors bonded lightly to liquid crys
tals. This bond regulates the orientation of
die crystals and determines their appear
ance. When the receptors encounter a
"target" chemical — say, a pesticide —
they break their bond with t he crystals and
grab hold of the target molecules. After
being released, the crystals switch orienta
tion and change color. When the danger
ous compound is no longer present, the
crystals reattach to the receptors and the
sensor returns to normal.

Hewlett-Packard announced last week
a process that brings the company closer to
nanocircuits — circuits based on parts just
a few atoms wide. HP said it was working
on a complex nanochip and could be mak
ing nanocomputers smaller than a bacteri
um in the next decade or so. The newly an
nounced process packs a number of differ
ent functions into a single nanochip by di
viding the chip into different zones where
independent calculations can take place.

Stephen Hawking's latest book, "The
Universe in a Nutshell" (Bantam Books),
seeks to tell you all you need to know about
the universe ... in just 216 pages. In the
book, Hawking tackles the "theory of
everything," theorizing on how informa
tion might be pulled out of black holes and
whether or not the future of humanity will
be anything like "Star Trek." But the heart
of the book explores something called M
theory, which theoretical physicists hope
will someday explain all the physics in die
universe. According to Hawking, every
thing we see and know might just be the
shadow of a five-dimensional world that
exists inside our universe. Now there's
something to think about.
