# Synchro takes financial and travel challenges in stroke
## 
### ASHLEY ENSIGN 
The Stanford synchronized swimming
team is back, on campus, but not for long.
After easily winning its only home meet of
the season. Jan. 20 against Washington, the
No. 2 Cardinal began its competitive season
on the road.
"The home meet was a great way to kit k
off the season. It was exciting to swim in front
of all our fans and know that there are lots
people supporting us," said sophomore
Amanda Graff-Baker. " That's important for
the team to remember as we travel for the
next six weeks."
This past weekend the team traveled to
William and Mary, where it won again on
its first trip of the quarter. Destinations for
the rest of this competitive season include
this weekend s meet against Michigan, two
trips to Arizona, Texas and Washington.
I lie final competition, Collegiate Nation
als, will take place at Wheaton College (lur
ing finals week.
The team's travel-heavy schedule isn't
ideal. Lack of fans, coping with time-zone
changes and missing classes makes travel es
pecially draining.
"We usually have to get up when most
Stanford students are falling asleep to
catch our flight," said senior Lindsey Wig
ginton. "Last Friday, we left campus at 4
a.m. We competed all day on Saturday and
then had to get up at 4 a.m. on Sunday to
travel home. By the time we had adjusted
to the time change, we were on ilu- plane
heading home."
While the team wishes it had more home
meets, the swimmers remain positive and in

good spirits.
"We are getting adapted to traveling and
competing in pools that are different from
our own, in particular indoor pools, like the
one we will be competing in for nationals,"
Wigginton said.
Junior Stephanie Joukoff also put a posi
tive spin on the travel.
"There is no use in being negative about
the travel situation," she said "We have come
to accept it and deal with it. Looking on the
bright side, it gives us time to bond and be
come closer as a team."
Why all the travel?
Collegiate synchro is still a very small
sport. Stanford is, in fact, the only school in
California with a team, flic East Coast has
more schools with synchro programs and, as
a result, Stanford travels more.
Funding is also a problem.
"Many teams across the country are club
teams and do not have the budget for travel.
Many of these girls pay for their travel out of
(heir own pocket," said Stanford head coach
I leather ()lson. " This makes it difficult for us
to get club teams to come to Stanford."
Finally, the Stanford team travels so
much because its superior talent gives it a
special responsibility to promote collegiate
synchro programs.
Currently, there are 29 collegiate syn
chronized swimming teams, but most of
them are small and at a beginner level.
However, nearly every member of the
Stanford team was on the U.S. Junior Na
tional l eam during high school, and most
Cardinal swimmers continue to rank among
the top synchronized swimmers
in the countr\. Three Stanford
synchro swimmers — sopho
mores Erin Dobratz. Katie N orris
and Wigginton— competed as
members of the U.S. Senior Na
tional I earn last year.
While that type of talent helps
attract new fans to the sport
around the nation, Stanford fans
will have to Wait a while before
catching another glimpse for
themselves — the Cardinal
doesn't perform at home until it
hosts an exhibition on March 2.
