### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Hie nascent Rio-X program lias a new leader, the
I niversity announced in a press release yesterday.
Medical school professor and noted researcher
Matthew I'. Scott w ill lead the ground-breaking in
terdisciplinary initiative for the next five years as
chair of the Rio-X leadership council, overseeing
the program din ing a c rucial time of development
and expansion.
Scott currently holds professorships in developmen
tal biology and genetics and serves on the faculty of the
Neurosciences and (lancer Riology programs in the
School of Medicine. I le also conducts research support
ed by the 1 loward I lughes Medical Institute.
"in virtually everyone's opinion, Dr. Scott is
uniquely qualified to c hair the leadership council
for Rio-X," wrote Philip Pi/zo, dean ofthe School of
Medicine, in a press release.
Scott will take on I he complex task of directing an ini
tiative that brings together faculty and students from
several different fields of stuch to conduct research in
bioengineering, biomedic ine and the biosciences.
"Education is the kc\ to successful interdisciplinary
research," Scott said in the press release. "My focus as
chair of the leadership council w ill be on curriculum
and promoting communication among scientists and
engineers who are used to speaking different lan
guages and who come from different c ultures.
"In mv own lab the increasing importance of en
gineering and biocomputation lias brought home the
need for such initiatives," he added.
Scott takes tlie helm from former Rio-X co-direc
tors |ames Spudic band ( '.banning Robertson, who

have helped to lead the program since its inception
in 1998.
"I'm absolutely delighted that Matt Scott has
agreed to take this job as we move forward into the
next phase of the program," Spudic h said in the re
lease. "I think he's going to do a great job."
Rio-X took off in 1999 when Netscape founder |im
('.lark gave the I niversity $150 million to construct
the ( lark ('.enter for Riomedical Engineering and Sci
ences, which is scheduled to open in 20(W as the local
point ofthe initiative.
While plans for the center have not been slowed bv
(Hark s decision to rescind $(>() million ol his gift in
protest of the Rush administration polic) on stem-cell
research, recouping the lost funding will present one
ofScott's greatest early challenges.
W hen the center opens, it will reported!) house 10
faculty members, about 10 of whom w ill be new to
Stanford, giving the Lniversit) "a potent influx of
new energy," as Scott put it.
I lie new faculty will be recruited by the depart
ments involved in the program, which span four
schools — Medicine, Engineering, Earth Sciences and
I lumanities and Sciences.
"Much remains to be done to make it eas\ for
teams from different fields to work elfectiveh togeth
er on a biological problem," Scott said. "Siniplx
putting people 112 rom different fields near each other is
not nearly enough.
"We will need to create new curricula, alter the
usual single student-single mentor structure and find
ways to overcome the language and conceptual barri
ers that prevent useful collaboration," he continued.
In his own research, Scott is
known for the 1983 co-discovery
of an important DNA sequence
known as the homeobox and for
his laboratory's identification of
the genetic cause of basal cell car
cinoma, the most common
human cancer.
"Biology by its nature brings
together lots of approaches and
fosters collaborations," he said.

"My current research is directed
at understanding the genetic
control of animal development
and the relations of developmen
tal biology to human disease.
"The degree to which all ani
mals — and indeed to a great ex
tent all living organisms — share
genes and proteins has been the
big surprise of the past 20 years,"
he added. " I his common genet
it heritage creates a common lan
guage among diverse types of bi
ologists, just as Bio-X should
among the different sciences and
engineering."
