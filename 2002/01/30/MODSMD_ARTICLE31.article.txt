I love the Super Bowl. It may be true that
I am a highly critical person, but I can
wholeheartedly say that I love the Super
Sunday. Sure there are some non-foot
ball related aspects of the Super Bowl that 1
don't enjoy — like 'NSYNC performing at last
year s halftiine show in front of some teeny-

hopper fans that were allowed
to rush the field with "I Love
Justin" signs — but there are
always things to pick up the
slack (like Britney Spears' out
lit at the same halftime show
that once again showed why
Britney is God's gift to hu
manity).
Obviously I love the game
itself because, face it, 1 love all

football games, and none are more intense
than the Super Bowl. Kvery year you get to
see, if not the two best teams in the N FL, then
at least the two hottest teams in the league,
fluking it out. And for all of the haters that
complain about the Patriots being in this
year's contest or the Giants last year, a team
doesn't win two or three playoff games to get
to the Super Bowl unless it plays some damn
good all-around football — and that means of
fense, defense and special teams.
If it were just a football game. I'd still love
the Super Bowl, but oh is there more to it than
just that.
I love tSPN's weekend-long marathon of
p;ist Super Bowl highlights, with incredibly
tacky music to go along with the classic clips of
