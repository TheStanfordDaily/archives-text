# Beer, wings and Britney
## 
### 
I love the Super Bowl. It may be true that
I am a highly critical person, but I can
wholeheartedly say that I love the Super
Sunday. Sure there are some non-foot
ball related aspects of the Super Bowl that 1
don't enjoy — like 'NSYNC performing at last
year s halftiine show in front of some teeny-

hopper fans that were allowed
to rush the field with "I Love
Justin" signs — but there are
always things to pick up the
slack (like Britney Spears' out
lit at the same halftime show
that once again showed why
Britney is God's gift to hu
manity).
Obviously I love the game
itself because, face it, 1 love all

football games, and none are more intense
than the Super Bowl. Kvery year you get to
see, if not the two best teams in the N FL, then
at least the two hottest teams in the league,
fluking it out. And for all of the haters that
complain about the Patriots being in this
year's contest or the Giants last year, a team
doesn't win two or three playoff games to get
to the Super Bowl unless it plays some damn
good all-around football — and that means of
fense, defense and special teams.
If it were just a football game. I'd still love
the Super Bowl, but oh is there more to it than
just that.
I love tSPN's weekend-long marathon of
p;ist Super Bowl highlights, with incredibly
tacky music to go along with the classic clips of


Ma< Levine
Joe Namath, Lynn Swann, Doug
Williams and .til the other Super
Bowl heroes of yesteryear.
I love the week-long media
blitz that always produces some
kind of scandal like the Atlanta
Falcons' supposed family man
Eugene Robinson (previously
nicknamed "The Prophet" for
his deep religious beliefs) get
ting caught trying to solicit oral
sex from.in undercover polite
woman the night before Super
Bowl XXXIII.
I love the pre-game show that
seems to start before I even wake
up on Super Bowl Sunday, a
show that is usuall) twice as long
as the game itself. Only one year
since I can remember have I not
watched almost the entire day's
worth of coverage, and that was
last year when I was just so anx
ious for mv beloved Giants to
take the field that I had to t;tke
my mind off of the game fora
couple hours.
1 love the bets that you can
place for the Super Bowl, rang
ing from which team will win re
ceive the opening kic kolf to what
defense will have more sacks to
whether or not Kurt W arner will
rush the ball three times or not.
I n case you were wondering, the
odds that New Kngland wins by
7-1 li points are 12/1, so get
read) to make some bets.
I love the mid-game commer
cials that cost more than the
GDP of some third-world coun
tries. Although I always Hip the
bird to the idiot that intently

watches the commercials, onlv
to turn away when the actual
football comes hack on, you've
gotta love the commercial venue
that has turned in such classics
as Larry Bird and Michael Jor
dan playing an inter'galactic
game of "Horse" in a Mc Don
alds' ad to the Budweiser frogs
forever croaking "Bud."
"Weissss." "Errrrr."
1 love the pre-game hoopla,
with planes living overhead and
the always stirring renditions of
the National Anthem — Whit
ney Houston singing at Super
Bowl \\\ in the midst of the
(»ulf War is definitely inv all
time favorite. I have to admit,
though, I am a little scared he
cause Mariah (late) is singing
the Anthem this year, and hon
estly, isn't she a little too slutty to
he patriotic ?
Even so, there's so much
about the big game that I love
(too much to even relay in this
column) and that is why 1 ab
solutek love Super Bowl parties.
Everyone sharing the experi
ence ol watching football, eating
chili and wings, and ol course
drinking some good old-fash
ioned American beer. You can't
get much better than that.
That's why I love it all, and
that's why you can find me in
front of a I V from the moment I
wake up on Sunday morning, to
the moment I pass out on Sun
day night from an excessive in
take of c liili, wings, beer, football
and, \es. even commercials.

Mat Levine bet 50 bucks that Mari
ah ha.\ another breakdown during
the National Anthem, or at least
throws in an annoxinir hi eh note.

1 love the pre-game hoopla,
with planes living overhead and
the always stirring renditions of
the National Anthem — Whit
ney Houston singing at Super
Bowl \\\ in the midst of the
(»ulf War is definitely inv all
time favorite. I have to admit,
though, I am a little scared he
cause Mariah (late) is singing
the Anthem this year, and hon
estly, isn't she a little too slutty to
he patriotic ?
Even so, there's so much
about the big game that I love
(too much to even relay in this
column) and that is why 1 ab
solutek love Super Bowl parties.
Everyone sharing the experi
ence ol watching football, eating
chili and wings, and ol course
drinking some good old-fash
ioned American beer. You can't
get much better than that.
That's why I love it all, and
that's why you can find me in
front of a I V from the moment I
wake up on Sunday morning, to
the moment I pass out on Sun
day night from an excessive in
take of c liili, wings, beer, football
and, \es. even commercials.

Mat Levine bet 50 bucks that Mari
ah ha.\ another breakdown during
the National Anthem, or at least
throws in an annoxinir hi eh note.
I love the Super Bowl. It may be true that
I am a highly critical person, but I can
wholeheartedly say that I love the Super
Sunday. Sure there are some non-foot
ball related aspects of the Super Bowl that 1
don't enjoy — like 'NSYNC performing at last
year s halftiine show in front of some teeny-

hopper fans that were allowed
to rush the field with "I Love
Justin" signs — but there are
always things to pick up the
slack (like Britney Spears' out
lit at the same halftime show
that once again showed why
Britney is God's gift to hu
manity).
Obviously I love the game
itself because, face it, 1 love all

football games, and none are more intense
than the Super Bowl. Kvery year you get to
see, if not the two best teams in the N FL, then
at least the two hottest teams in the league,
fluking it out. And for all of the haters that
complain about the Patriots being in this
year's contest or the Giants last year, a team
doesn't win two or three playoff games to get
to the Super Bowl unless it plays some damn
good all-around football — and that means of
fense, defense and special teams.
If it were just a football game. I'd still love
the Super Bowl, but oh is there more to it than
just that.
I love tSPN's weekend-long marathon of
p;ist Super Bowl highlights, with incredibly
tacky music to go along with the classic clips of


Ma< Levine
Joe Namath, Lynn Swann, Doug
Williams and .til the other Super
Bowl heroes of yesteryear.
I love the week-long media
blitz that always produces some
kind of scandal like the Atlanta
Falcons' supposed family man
Eugene Robinson (previously
nicknamed "The Prophet" for
his deep religious beliefs) get
ting caught trying to solicit oral
sex from.in undercover polite
woman the night before Super
Bowl XXXIII.
I love the pre-game show that
seems to start before I even wake
up on Super Bowl Sunday, a
show that is usuall) twice as long
as the game itself. Only one year
since I can remember have I not
watched almost the entire day's
worth of coverage, and that was
last year when I was just so anx
ious for mv beloved Giants to
take the field that I had to t;tke
my mind off of the game fora
couple hours.
1 love the bets that you can
place for the Super Bowl, rang
ing from which team will win re
ceive the opening kic kolf to what
defense will have more sacks to
whether or not Kurt W arner will
rush the ball three times or not.
I n case you were wondering, the
odds that New Kngland wins by
7-1 li points are 12/1, so get
read) to make some bets.
I love the mid-game commer
cials that cost more than the
GDP of some third-world coun
tries. Although I always Hip the
bird to the idiot that intently

watches the commercials, onlv
to turn away when the actual
football comes hack on, you've
gotta love the commercial venue
that has turned in such classics
as Larry Bird and Michael Jor
dan playing an inter'galactic
game of "Horse" in a Mc Don
alds' ad to the Budweiser frogs
forever croaking "Bud."
"Weissss." "Errrrr."
