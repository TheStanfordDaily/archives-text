Montgomery saicl he expects ju
nior center Curtis Borchardt,
who is recovering from at ight
hip pointer, to play on Ihursday
against Arizona State.
"It's a bruise, not a broken
bone," Montgomery said. "The
only thing that could hapjx'n is if
he got hit on that s|x>t again, it
would |X)tentially him more. But
we're going to pad it [in practice]."
Borchardt .sat out Monday's
practice but practiced yesterday.
The 7-foot center suffered the
injury on the opening tip-offof the
UCLA game last week. I le scored
13 points and grabbed eight re
bounds in the Cardinal's 86-76
win over the Bruins, Stanford's

fifth straight at Pauley Pavilion.
After that game, the pain in
tensified. forcing Borchardt to sit
out of the Cardinal's loss to
Southern California on Saturday
with what was reported as a
strained abdominal muscle.
The injur)* was re-diagnosed to
Ik- a hip pointer after further ex
amination. The abdominal pain
and original diagnosis are under
standable — the stomach muscle
involved attaches to the right hip.
"It's an awkward injury Ix 1 -
cause of where it happened,"
Montgomery said. "Everything
you do when you try to twist or
turn or lift you arms revolves
there, so it's difficult. It will be
painful fora week or more, but its
not something that will cause fur
ther damage. It's just a matter of
dealing with the pain."
