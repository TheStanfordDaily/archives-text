### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team (7-

the mat Friday fora pair of home
dual meets against Nevada and
Cal State-Fullerton.

WRESTLING
Friday: Stanford vs. Nevada, 5
p.m., Stanford vs. Cal State-
Fullerton, 7 p.m., Burnham
Pavilion

Redshht freshman Matt Clentry
will look to extend his siring of
consecutive dual meet victories to
nine by the end of the day while
the team hopes to make the crowd
at Burnham Pavilion forget last
Saturday's tough defeat at the
hands of Oregon State.
The first match begins at 5 p.m.

"We're looking to take some of
our frustration from the Oregon
State meet out this weekend," said
head coach Steve Buddie. "We
fully expect to beat them both.
Reno is a young program and
Fullerton has gone up and down
in its history and has lost to some
teams we've beaten."
In fact, Fullerton (3-11,0-5 Pac
-10) has lost three meets to teams
Stanford has beaten. That includes
two losses to Embry-Riddle, whom
the Cardinal dominated 31-9 last
weekend.
The Titans lost seven starters
from last year's team, including
their only NCAA qualifier, All-
American Bahak Nejadmaghad
dam at 197 pounds.
Nejadmaghaddam went 23-6 in
his final season at Fullerton.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will
compete at theAll-Cal Invitational
in San Francisco along with the

seven other wrestling schools in
California.
Hie format of the tournament
allows teams to enter two
wrestlers in each weight class, giv
ing wrestlers not in the starting
lineup a chance to compete late in
the season.
There also might be some

added incentive lor Stanford's
starters to perform well.
"It's an opportunity for some of
our guys who lost to a C.alitornia
scliool opponent to redeem them
selves,"' Buddie said.
