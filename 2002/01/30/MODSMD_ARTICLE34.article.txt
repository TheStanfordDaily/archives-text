# Pats will announce QB today
## 
### 
N EW ()RLEANS (AP) â€” Tom Brady is younger,
nimbler and throws short, quick passes. Drew Bled
soe is experienced, stands taller in the pocket and
throws deep.
" I here are differences, but one similarity in our
favor is they're both winners," New England Patriots
wide receiver (lharles Johnson said.
I hat may make today's planned announcement
ol who will start in the Super Bowl on Sunday less
monumental than antic ipated.
Play ers don't think they'd play much differently
no matter who gets the call against the St. Louis
Rams. Besides, both teams will have several days of
practice knowing who will be quarterbacking the
Patriots.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick was no more forth
coming Tuesday than he was a day earlier.
"There is nothing really new there," he said
during media day, when players and head coaches
from both teams met with reporters and broad
casters.
But Brady showed up without crutches or a limp.
Asked if lie expected to play in the big game, he
said, "Yeah, darn right I am."
He hasn't tested the strength of his injured left
ankle, but he said it isn't swollen and he'll put his full
weight on it today ;it the Patriots' first practice.
But Bledsoe will get most of the practice plays if
he's the starter.
" I want t< > play as bad as I ever wanted anything,"
he said. "I mean, it's the Super Bowl. It's what you
play for."
Bledsoe, a nine-year veteran, and second-year
pro Brady have remained friends through a turbu
lent season. Bledsoe suffered serious chest bleeding
late in the second game and Brady took over in the
10-3 loss to the Jets.
I'he Patriots were 0-2 when Brady came in; they
are 13-3 since then.
I le seemed certain to play the rest of the season.
Then he sprained his left ankle late in the first half of
l.ist Sunday s 24-17 win over Pittsburgh.
Bledsoe, playing for the first time in more than
lour months, threw an I 1-yard touchdown pass that

made the halftime score 14-3, then led a field-goal
drive and helped take time oil the clock with clutch
third-down completions.
"1 compare it to giving a starving man a little
taste," he said.
On the touchdown, he lofted the ball to David Pat
ten deep in the right corner of the end zone, a pass
Brady rarely makes.
"We are in a unique situation," Johnson said.
"1 low many teams lose a quarterback in that magni
tude of a game and have a guy come in and play at
that caliber?"
With two quarterbacks who aren't threats to run,
the Rams wouldn't have to make major acljustments.
"We played Atlanta earlier in the season and did
not know if Chris Chandler or Michael Vick was
going to be starting," R;nns linebacker London
Fletcher said.
Chandler is a pocket passer and Vick is a scram
bler, but the Patriots quarterbacks play similar styles.
"We don't change how we prepare for an upcom
ing game based on the starting quarterback," Fletch
er said.
The Patriots blockers take the same approach.
"We don't have a Donovan McNabb back there.
They're not going to go up the middle and run,"
guard Mike Compton said; "But once they're back
there, they're going to get the ball where they really
netd to."
Bledsoe takes more time doing it, since Brady
throws more slant and screen passes.
"When Drew is in there we know we have to hold
up our blocks longer," center Damien Woody said.
Ultimately, Belichick's choice comes down to
two attractive options. Bledsoe has been in three
Pro Bowls and probably would have kept his job
if he didn't get hurt. Brady has won the last eight
games and showed his poise by bringing the Pa
triots back fora 1 (>-1 overtime win over ()akland
in a snowstorm at Foxboro Stadium in their play
off opener.
"Drew's done it before. Tom's been doing a great
job all year," Compton said. "So whoever's in there
doesn't drop our chances."
