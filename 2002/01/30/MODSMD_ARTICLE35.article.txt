# Bush delivers first State of the Union
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
said Tuesday night that tens of thousands of
terrorists still threaten America — "ticking
time bombs, set to go off' — and promised to
stalk them ac l oss the globe. 1 n his first State of
the Union address, he pledged a battle of
equal vigor to revive the ailing economy.
"We will prevail in war, and we will defeat
this recession," the commander in chief said,
standing before Congress and the public with
heroically high approval ratings.
Nearly five months after the Sept. 11 at
tacks that shocked the world, Bush pledged to
push the war on terrorism beyond
Afghanistan to a do/en countries that he said
harbor terrorist camps. I le also warned of "an
axis of evil" of nations like North Korea, Iran
and Iraq, and said the United States would
not allow them to threaten the world with
weapons of mass destruction.
Offering chilling evidence of terrorists'
plotting, Bush said I S. forces in Afghanistan
found diagrams of American nuclear power
plants hidden in terrorist hide-outs.
Bush entered the parked House chamber
to boisterous applause from Republic ans and
Democrats alike.
Seconds into his speech, he made a fist, and
tapped it lightly against the podium as he- de
clared that despite terrorism and recession,
"the state of our union has never been
stronger."
Democrats, responding to Bush, sought to
show unity on the war while reinforcing dif
ferences on domestic policy.

House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt's
words for terrorists were similar to Bush's:
"Make no mistake about it: We are going to
hunt you clown and make you pay." But he*
also c hallenged GOP positions on Social Se
curity, taxes and health c are.
In a 48-minute speech interrupted by ap
plause more than 70 times, Bush urged Con
gress to pass his tax-cutting economic pack
age and challenged Americans to commit two
years or 4,000 hours to community service.
He hopes to tap the surge in patriotism since
the attacks.
"We can overcome evil with greater good,"
the president said.
Amid extraordinary security, leaders of the
congressional, judicial and executive branch
es gathered beneath the same Capitol dome
that officials believe was targeted during the
attacks on Washington and New York.
Dick Cheney, who has spent many nights
in undisclosed locations because of security
precautions, took the vice president's tradi
tional place on the rostrum behind the presi
dent during the speech.
In the gallery, first lady Laura Bush was
joined by several guests in her VIP box high
above the- well of the House, including inter
im Afghan leader Hamid karxai and fire
fighters, soldiers and other c iti/en-heroes
whose stories helped buoy a weary nation.
"The men and women of our armed forces
have delivered a message to every enemy of
the United States,'' Bush said. "You will not
escape the justice of this nation."

Outlining his post-Afghanistan battle
plans, ilu- president vowed to unearth "a ter
rorist underworld" of training camps in at
least a dozen countries, including the Philip
pines, Bosnia and Somalia. Me said nations
will be given a chance to wipe out terrorists
themselves, and the United States is willing to
assist their efforts.
But, he warned: "If they do not act, Amer
ica will."
In his strongest terms yet, Bush called
North Korea, Iraq and Iran part of an "axis of
evil." warning that their pursuit of weapons of
mass destruction pose a "grave and growing
danger" and will not be tolerated.
"I will not wait on events, while dangers
gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws ( los
er and closer," Bush said.
The nation's 43rd president addressed
Americans with a degree of national unity
conferred on no other chief executive since
Franklin I). Roosevelt. In polls, more than 80
percent of Americans say they approve of his
performance.
In the Democratic response, Gephardt
mentioned Knron Corp., the Texas-based en
ergy company linked to Bush that collapsed
with the life savings of many workert.
Bush did not mention Knron, but asked (Con
gress to enact pension reform and require more
finaiK ial disclosure from companies.
"Corporate America must be made more
accountable to employees and shareholders
and held to the highest standards of con
duct," Bush said.
