TALLAHASSEE, Ma. (AP) —
Gov. |eb Bush's 24-year-old
daughter was arrested at a phar
macy drive-through window yes
terday on charges of trying to buy
the anti-anxiety drug Xanax with a
fraudulent prescription.
Authorities said Noelle Bush
apparently posed as a doctor and
called in the phony prescription
after suffering a panic attack Mon
day evening.
Bush, who was supposed to
start a new job Tuesday at a soft
ware company, was jailed and re
leased pending a Jan. SI arraign
ment. Police said she was released
without having to post bond.
She could get up to five years in
prison and a $5,000 fine if convic t
ed. Bush's attorney, former Mori
da deputy attorney general Pete
Antonacci, could not be reached
after hours at his office.
|eb Bush and his wife, Colum
ba. issued a statement saying they
were "deeply saddened" by the in
cident involving their only daugh
ter. I hey said "substance abuse is
an issue confronting many families
across our nation."
"She's doing fine," the gover
nor said. "It's really hard for our
family, but a lot of families go
through this."
President George Bush's twin
daughters, Jenna and Barbara,
have gotten in trouble for under
age drinking.
Jeb and Columba Bush have
said that one of their three chil
dren struggled with a drug prob
lem after Bush's unsuccessful first
run for governor in 1994. They
did not say whether it was Noelle
or one of her brothers. Columba
Bush has also worked on behalf of

a Florida group involved in edu
cating families about drug abuse.
According to police, a woman
called a Walgreens pharmacy late
Monday to see if a prescription
had been called in for Noelle Bush.
Pharmacist Carlos Zimmerman
checked the voice mail and heard a
woman claiming to be Dr. Noel
Scidmore requesting a prescrip
tion for Xanax, a prescription
drug similar to Valium that is nor
mally used to treat anxiety disor
ders.
Zimmerman told police the
prescription sounded suspicious
because there was 110 quantity in
dicated. I le saved the message, de
scribed by police as "shaky."
Within 20 minutes, the woman
called back to check 011 the pre
scription and Zimmerman said he
needed a specific quantity. He re
ceived ,\ voice mail message about
10 minutes later specifying the
quantity.
He then called the doctor's an
swering service. Another doctor
returned the call and said Scid
more "is moving and isn't really
practicing now." The doctor said
the phoned-in prescription should
be treated as fraudulent.
When the woman called back to
check on the prescription again,
t lie pharmacist told her it would be
ready shortly. Noelle Bush drove
up in her white Volkswagen about
I a.m. and was waiting there when
police arrived.
Police said Noelle Bush's voice
and the voice 011 the answering
machine appear to be identical.
She allegedly told police that the
contact number for Scidmore left
on the pharmacy answering ma
chine is her second phone line.
