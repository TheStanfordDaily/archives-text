the United States are targets of
harassment and suspicion solely
because of their ethnicity, said
Alexander. Their stories are not
heard because they are afraid of
becoming targets of investigation.
Audience member Shirin Sin
nar echoed this complaint after
Alexander's talk.
"A lot of people are not aware
how profound the racial profiling
is among Arab and Muslim com
munities in the United States, and
it is important that the outside
communities are informed of the
harassment," she said.
When stories did make it to
the public, they received luke
warm responses, said Alexander.
"Americans feel that if they
are willing to undergo searches,
what is the difference if some
people undergo a little more?"
Alexander said. She said that,
due to the September attacks,
racial profiling is becoming a
more entrenched and expected
part of American life.
"Racial profiling is an extreme
ly slippery slope," Alexander said.

"It signals a dangerous trend that
could spiral out of control." She
argued that racial profiling will
not work because it will not make
people feel more secure.
"Alexander's argument con
vinced me of why it's imperative
for American's to resist the urge
to target groups of a specific
ethnicity in this frightening
post-Sept. 1 1 period," said
freshman Jessica Williams.
Graduate student Evelyn Al
sultany agreed.
"1 found the argument that
racial profiling only provides an
illusion of greater security,
rather than actual security, to be
a compelling argument," Alsul
tany said. "1 found the talk to be
informative."
Alexander showed that when
race was eliminated in the drug
search at airports, the amount of
drug seizures increased by 65
percent. Therefore, Alexander
said that law enforcement offi
cials do not need to rely on racial
profiling to do their job, because
terrorists come in all colors.
Instead of falling down the
slope of racial profiling, Alexan
der advocated educating the
public and building a movement
