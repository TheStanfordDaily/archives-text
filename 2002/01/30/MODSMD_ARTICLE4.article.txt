Racial profiling will not make

ing to American Civil Liberties
Union civil rights attorney
Michelle Alexander, who stressed
this point in a talk on campus last
night titled "Racial Profiling in the
Wake i >1 Sept. 11.
"Racial profiling is an old
issue that does not go away but
has changed dramatically since
the attacks on Sept. I 1," said A1
(lamarillo, director of the ('.en
ter for Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity, which
sponsored the event.
"Policies have shifted and
groups have been added to the
discussion [who were| previ
ously excluded, Camarillo
said.
1 he focus of Alexander's
lecture and question-and-an
swer forum was the futility of
racial profiling and how its
nature has changed due to
t be war on terrorism.
Alexander — also the di
rector of the Racial Justice
Project, which works towards
the elimination of racial bias in
the justice system — said the

racial profiling that has result
ed from the Sept. 1 I attacks is
based on "palpable fear and
dramatic loss of security."
"People are willing to sacrifice
the rights of others for the illusion
of greater security," .Alexander
said. She said the racial profiling
tli.it is going on now is similar to
that of the so-called war on drugs,
where African American and Lati
no men are targeted. As ('.aniaril

"We force people oil planes
and out of bus stations because
of the color of their skin, be
cause people don't trust them
based on how they look,"
Alexander said.
