# Humanities track marked by contentious past

Editors Note: This is the first of a three-part se

histoty; tomoirow and Friday, The Daily it'ill
nmluate student satisfaction with IHI'M and
the future of the program.
Although he says he didn't plan it this
way, former University President Cer
liard Casper picked a historically signifi
cant name lor the I HUM course he
taught hist fall. Hie name, "Citizenship,"
was the same one the University used for
its first freshman humanities requirement
in 1919.

The 1933 description of the "Prob
lems of Citizenship" course said that ii
aimed to promote a "/est for relating
the various parts of a university pro
gram of study" and"a deeper sense of
the long view of history."
Although the goals of the freshman re
quirement have remained largely un
changed for the last 82 years, the struc
ture and content of the courses have

changed immensely to respond to
c hanges in the humanities.
I he "Problems of Citizenship"
course ran for Mi years, until it was
replaced in 1935 by the "History of
Western Civilization" course.
"Western Civ" was a course on
European thought as it developed
from ancient times to the present
and was the cornerstone of Stan
lord's undergraduate program.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
has talked to many alumni about
the course.
"They all think that Stanford's
old Western Civ program is the
greatest thing they ever did in their
lives," he said.
I he program started to lose co
hesion in the late 19605, and a com
prehensive review of undergradu
ate education in 1968 recommend
ed its termination. By 1970, its al
most 35-year reign was over and
students only needed to take any
three-quartet combination of hu
manities courses.
CIV embroils Stanford in
"Culture Wars"
A freshman humanities re
quirement was brought back in
1980 in the form of the Western
(ailture Program, which had a re
quired leading list of 15 books
and several different tracks. But
by the late 1980s, the monolithic
nature of the program had begun
to come under attack.
Students protested on campus,
calling for the inclusion of non-
Western content in the course. Ral -
lies were held where students
chanted, "Hey! Ho! Western Civ
has got to go."
Asst. Prof, of Philosophy
Nadeem Hussain, who graduat
ed from Stanford as a symbolic
systems major in 1990, took part
in demonstrations against the
program.
"In those days, the main con
corns of most people were to make
sure that it wasn't just dead white
men," Hussain said. Although he
did not share exactly the same
views as his fellow protesters — he
was pushing fora more intense
two-year requirement — lie joined
forces with anti-Western Culture
demonstrators and helped plan a
storming of the University presi
dent's office.
I his oil-campus action placed
Stanford at the center of the na
tional "Culture Wars," which were

concerned with the political conse
quences of teaching the humani
ties. Stanford was featured on the
editorial pages of The New York
limes, The Wall Street Journal,
the Washington Post and the Los
Angeles Times, among others.
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
who served as head of the Western
Culture program from 1987-89
iiiid went on to head a course in the
Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
grain that replaced it, noted that
both programs were under such in
tense national scrutiny.
"When the program was being
devised in the late 1980s, it became
a matter of a kind of national argu
ment starting in Ihe Wall Street
Journal with big-time American
politicians on both sides," Robin
sou said. "CIV came into bad odor
when it became a kind of political
football at its launching."
Western Culture and CIV were
similar in that they had tracks in
several departments and a com
mon list of readings. In CIV. how
ever, the common reading list was
reduced from 15 to six books and
was made more flexible than the
one in Western Culture.
I he change that attracted the
most attention, however, was ClV's
explicit commitment to multicul
turalism. The 1988 legislation re
quired that every track include
works by "women, minorities and
persons of color," study a non-Eu
ropean c ulture and address topics
of race, gender and c lass.
On tlie same day in 1988, both
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and William
Bennett, the Secretary of Educa
tion under President Ronald Rea
gan, spoke at Stanford on opposing
political sides.
Bennett called Stanford's deci
sion to switch to a less-Eurocentric
course a capitulation to a "cam
paign of pressure politics and in
timidation."
A 1997 article in the Chronicle
of I ligher Education said that CI V
was "hailed by some as the birth of
multicultural education and de
cried by others as the death of the
Western canon."
Asa result of the largely negative
publicity, the course became taint
ed in people's minds, including
those of alumni and donors.
Nevertheless, CIV was going
strong until 1993, when then-Uni
versity President Casper called for
a comprehensive review of under
graduate education, as had been
done 25 years before in 1968. After
three years of deliberation by the
Faculty Senate, the Introduction to
the 11 umanitics program was born.

I-Hum eliminates core list,
reduces controversy
CI V started to get phased out by
IHUM in 1997 and was fully re
placed by it in 1999. According to
Cognizant Dean for the Humani
ties Keith Baker, who was on the
1997 CIV Design and Review
Committee, the move from CIV to
IHUM was "really was quite a dra
matic change."
Among the biggest reforms was
a new design that split the three
quarter sequence into a one-quar
ter interdisciplinary course focus
ing on methodology and a two
quarter depart mental sequence.
IHUM has no common read
ing list nor any required cate
gories. The only restrictions on
the books assigned are that they
do not exceed five in the lall quar
ter and that they "affirm the spirit
of inclusiveness."
The move to IHUM generated
much less controversy than the
change to CIV, and Robinson said
that this lack of attention was seen
as a political success in the eyes of
the administration.
"The CIV program was really
basically a Western Culture pro
gram with additions," he said.
"What in fact replaced it is less tra
ditional than the CIV program
was, much less coherent than that.
And yet, it was politically successful
because it didn't attract any atten
tion. T here was one op-ed piece at
tacking it in the Wall Street Jour
nal, and nobody picked up on it."
In 1988, a Wall Street Journal
editorial accused a CI V course en
titled "Europe and the Americas"
of "phasing out the West" and "rid
ing the hobby-horses of today's po
litical left."
But a 1998 I-Hum course, "Un
derstanding Being Chinese," re
ceived no attention in the national
media, nor has a winter-spring course
offered this year entitled "American
(Jenesis: Indigenous Texts."

Baker said that 11IUM receives so
little scrutiny from the national
media because the "Culture Wars"
have died down since 1988. Where
as the transit i< >n to CI V was a "media
event, by the time we got around to
moving from CIV to IHUM, it
wasn't as hot an issue" lie said.
Casper: "Requirements get tired"
During the IHUM design
process, however, some dissatis
faction arose in the ranks of the
faculty members. About 30 pro
lessors and lecturers involved in
the CIV program signed a peti
tion protesting the review process
ofCIV. They said that the admin
istration had imposed the change
on a reluctant faculty to clear the
political air that had been sullied
by CIV.
On Nov. 20, 1996, History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee-Chappell wrote a
letter to the editor of the Stanford
Report saying that the administra
tion had infringed on the faculty's
right to academic freedom.
"In their determination to im
pose their replacement for CIV,
the president and provost have
shown disrespect for the right of
faculty members to speak their
mind when they disagree with the
administration's line," she wrote.
Casper dismissed such com
plaints.
" I he assessment of the program
and the report 1 don't think were
Hawed," he said. "But obviously
one can have dilferent views of
that. And that is now neither here
nor there. All such requirements
get tired, sooner or later."
IHUM will be five years old next
fall. The Faculty Senate will review
the program next year and every
four years thereafter. In 2008, the
"sunset clause" of the lIIUM legis
lation will take effect, mandating
that the entire program be re
vamped and "renewed" at the end
of 10 years.

did not share exactly the same
views as his fellow protesters — he
was pushing fora more intense
two-year requirement — lie joined
forces with anti-Western Culture
demonstrators and helped plan a
storming of the University presi
dent's office.
I his oil-campus action placed
Stanford at the center of the na
tional "Culture Wars," which were

concerned with the political conse
quences of teaching the humani
ties. Stanford was featured on the
editorial pages of The New York
limes, The Wall Street Journal,
the Washington Post and the Los
Angeles Times, among others.
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
who served as head of the Western
Culture program from 1987-89
iiiid went on to head a course in the
Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
grain that replaced it, noted that
both programs were under such in
tense national scrutiny.
"When the program was being
devised in the late 1980s, it became
a matter of a kind of national argu
ment starting in Ihe Wall Street
Journal with big-time American
politicians on both sides," Robin
sou said. "CIV came into bad odor
when it became a kind of political
football at its launching."
Western Culture and CIV were
similar in that they had tracks in
several departments and a com
mon list of readings. In CIV. how
ever, the common reading list was
reduced from 15 to six books and
was made more flexible than the
one in Western Culture.
I he change that attracted the
most attention, however, was ClV's
explicit commitment to multicul
turalism. The 1988 legislation re
quired that every track include
works by "women, minorities and
persons of color," study a non-Eu
ropean c ulture and address topics
of race, gender and c lass.
On tlie same day in 1988, both
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and William
Bennett, the Secretary of Educa
tion under President Ronald Rea
gan, spoke at Stanford on opposing
political sides.
Bennett called Stanford's deci
sion to switch to a less-Eurocentric
course a capitulation to a "cam
paign of pressure politics and in
timidation."
A 1997 article in the Chronicle
of I ligher Education said that CI V
was "hailed by some as the birth of
multicultural education and de
cried by others as the death of the
Western canon."
Asa result of the largely negative
publicity, the course became taint
ed in people's minds, including
those of alumni and donors.
Nevertheless, CIV was going
strong until 1993, when then-Uni
versity President Casper called for
a comprehensive review of under
graduate education, as had been
done 25 years before in 1968. After
three years of deliberation by the
Faculty Senate, the Introduction to
the 11 umanitics program was born.

I-Hum eliminates core list,
reduces controversy
CI V started to get phased out by
IHUM in 1997 and was fully re
placed by it in 1999. According to
Cognizant Dean for the Humani
ties Keith Baker, who was on the
1997 CIV Design and Review
Committee, the move from CIV to
IHUM was "really was quite a dra
matic change."
Among the biggest reforms was
a new design that split the three
quarter sequence into a one-quar
ter interdisciplinary course focus
ing on methodology and a two
quarter depart mental sequence.
IHUM has no common read
ing list nor any required cate
gories. The only restrictions on
the books assigned are that they
do not exceed five in the lall quar
ter and that they "affirm the spirit
of inclusiveness."
The move to IHUM generated
much less controversy than the
change to CIV, and Robinson said
that this lack of attention was seen
as a political success in the eyes of
the administration.
"The CIV program was really
basically a Western Culture pro
gram with additions," he said.
"What in fact replaced it is less tra
ditional than the CIV program
was, much less coherent than that.
And yet, it was politically successful
because it didn't attract any atten
tion. T here was one op-ed piece at
tacking it in the Wall Street Jour
nal, and nobody picked up on it."
In 1988, a Wall Street Journal
editorial accused a CI V course en
titled "Europe and the Americas"
of "phasing out the West" and "rid
ing the hobby-horses of today's po
litical left."
But a 1998 I-Hum course, "Un
derstanding Being Chinese," re
ceived no attention in the national
media, nor has a winter-spring course
offered this year entitled "American
(Jenesis: Indigenous Texts."

Baker said that 11IUM receives so
little scrutiny from the national
media because the "Culture Wars"
have died down since 1988. Where
as the transit i< >n to CI V was a "media
event, by the time we got around to
moving from CIV to IHUM, it
wasn't as hot an issue" lie said.
Casper: "Requirements get tired"
During the IHUM design
process, however, some dissatis
faction arose in the ranks of the
faculty members. About 30 pro
lessors and lecturers involved in
the CIV program signed a peti
tion protesting the review process
ofCIV. They said that the admin
istration had imposed the change
on a reluctant faculty to clear the
political air that had been sullied
by CIV.
On Nov. 20, 1996, History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee-Chappell wrote a
letter to the editor of the Stanford
Report saying that the administra
tion had infringed on the faculty's
right to academic freedom.
"In their determination to im
pose their replacement for CIV,
the president and provost have
shown disrespect for the right of
faculty members to speak their
mind when they disagree with the
administration's line," she wrote.
Casper dismissed such com
plaints.
" I he assessment of the program
and the report 1 don't think were
Hawed," he said. "But obviously
one can have dilferent views of
that. And that is now neither here
nor there. All such requirements
get tired, sooner or later."
IHUM will be five years old next
fall. The Faculty Senate will review
the program next year and every
four years thereafter. In 2008, the
"sunset clause" of the lIIUM legis
lation will take effect, mandating
that the entire program be re
vamped and "renewed" at the end
of 10 years.

quirement have remained largely un
changed for the last 82 years, the struc

changed immensely to respond to

I he "Problems of Citizenship"
course ran for Mi years, until it was
replaced in 1935 by the "History of
Western Civilization" course.
"Western Civ" was a course on
European thought as it developed
from ancient times to the present
and was the cornerstone of Stan
lord's undergraduate program.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
has talked to many alumni about
the course.
"They all think that Stanford's
old Western Civ program is the
greatest thing they ever did in their
lives," he said.
I he program started to lose co
hesion in the late 19605, and a com
prehensive review of undergradu
ate education in 1968 recommend
ed its termination. By 1970, its al
most 35-year reign was over and
students only needed to take any
three-quartet combination of hu
manities courses.
CIV embroils Stanford in
"Culture Wars"
A freshman humanities re
quirement was brought back in
1980 in the form of the Western
(ailture Program, which had a re
quired leading list of 15 books
and several different tracks. But
by the late 1980s, the monolithic
nature of the program had begun
to come under attack.
Students protested on campus,
calling for the inclusion of non-
Western content in the course. Ral -
lies were held where students
chanted, "Hey! Ho! Western Civ
has got to go."
Asst. Prof, of Philosophy
Nadeem Hussain, who graduat
ed from Stanford as a symbolic
systems major in 1990, took part
in demonstrations against the
program.

IHUM in 1997 and was fully re
placed by it in 1999. According to
Cognizant Dean for the Humani
ties Keith Baker, who was on the
1997 CIV Design and Review
Committee, the move from CIV to
IHUM was "really was quite a dra
matic change."
Among the biggest reforms was
a new design that split the three
quarter sequence into a one-quar
ter interdisciplinary course focus
ing on methodology and a two
quarter depart mental sequence.
IHUM has no common read
ing list nor any required cate
gories. The only restrictions on
the books assigned are that they
do not exceed five in the lall quar
ter and that they "affirm the spirit
of inclusiveness."
The move to IHUM generated
much less controversy than the
change to CIV, and Robinson said
that this lack of attention was seen
as a political success in the eyes of
the administration.
"The CIV program was really
basically a Western Culture pro
gram with additions," he said.
"What in fact replaced it is less tra
ditional than the CIV program
was, much less coherent than that.
And yet, it was politically successful
because it didn't attract any atten
tion. T here was one op-ed piece at
tacking it in the Wall Street Jour
nal, and nobody picked up on it."
In 1988, a Wall Street Journal
editorial accused a CI V course en
titled "Europe and the Americas"
of "phasing out the West" and "rid
ing the hobby-horses of today's po
litical left."
But a 1998 I-Hum course, "Un
derstanding Being Chinese," re
ceived no attention in the national
media, nor has a winter-spring course
offered this year entitled "American
(Jenesis: Indigenous Texts."

Baker said that 11IUM receives so
little scrutiny from the national
media because the "Culture Wars"
have died down since 1988. Where
as the transit i< >n to CI V was a "media
event, by the time we got around to
moving from CIV to IHUM, it
wasn't as hot an issue" lie said.
Casper: "Requirements get tired"
During the IHUM design
process, however, some dissatis
faction arose in the ranks of the
faculty members. About 30 pro
lessors and lecturers involved in
the CIV program signed a peti
tion protesting the review process
ofCIV. They said that the admin
istration had imposed the change
on a reluctant faculty to clear the
political air that had been sullied
by CIV.
On Nov. 20, 1996, History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee-Chappell wrote a
letter to the editor of the Stanford
Report saying that the administra
tion had infringed on the faculty's
right to academic freedom.
"In their determination to im
pose their replacement for CIV,
the president and provost have
shown disrespect for the right of
faculty members to speak their
mind when they disagree with the
administration's line," she wrote.
Casper dismissed such com
plaints.
" I he assessment of the program
and the report 1 don't think were
Hawed," he said. "But obviously
one can have dilferent views of
that. And that is now neither here
nor there. All such requirements
get tired, sooner or later."
IHUM will be five years old next
fall. The Faculty Senate will review
the program next year and every
four years thereafter. In 2008, the
"sunset clause" of the lIIUM legis
lation will take effect, mandating
that the entire program be re
vamped and "renewed" at the end
of 10 years.

nmluate student satisfaction with IHI'M and
the future of the program.
Although he says he didn't plan it this
way, former University President Cer
liard Casper picked a historically signifi
cant name lor the I HUM course he
taught hist fall. Hie name, "Citizenship,"
was the same one the University used for
its first freshman humanities requirement
in 1919.

The 1933 description of the "Prob
lems of Citizenship" course said that ii
aimed to promote a "/est for relating
the various parts of a university pro
gram of study" and"a deeper sense of
the long view of history."
Although the goals of the freshman re
quirement have remained largely un
changed for the last 82 years, the struc
ture and content of the courses have

changed immensely to respond to
c hanges in the humanities.
I he "Problems of Citizenship"
course ran for Mi years, until it was
replaced in 1935 by the "History of
Western Civilization" course.
"Western Civ" was a course on
European thought as it developed
from ancient times to the present
and was the cornerstone of Stan
lord's undergraduate program.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
has talked to many alumni about
the course.
"They all think that Stanford's
old Western Civ program is the
greatest thing they ever did in their
lives," he said.
I he program started to lose co
hesion in the late 19605, and a com
prehensive review of undergradu
ate education in 1968 recommend
ed its termination. By 1970, its al
most 35-year reign was over and
students only needed to take any
three-quartet combination of hu
manities courses.
CIV embroils Stanford in
"Culture Wars"
A freshman humanities re
quirement was brought back in
1980 in the form of the Western
(ailture Program, which had a re
quired leading list of 15 books
and several different tracks. But
by the late 1980s, the monolithic
nature of the program had begun
to come under attack.
Students protested on campus,
calling for the inclusion of non-
Western content in the course. Ral -
lies were held where students
chanted, "Hey! Ho! Western Civ
has got to go."
Asst. Prof, of Philosophy
Nadeem Hussain, who graduat
ed from Stanford as a symbolic
systems major in 1990, took part
in demonstrations against the
program.
"In those days, the main con
corns of most people were to make
sure that it wasn't just dead white
men," Hussain said. Although he
did not share exactly the same
views as his fellow protesters — he
was pushing fora more intense
two-year requirement — lie joined
forces with anti-Western Culture
demonstrators and helped plan a
storming of the University presi
dent's office.
I his oil-campus action placed
Stanford at the center of the na
tional "Culture Wars," which were

concerned with the political conse
quences of teaching the humani
ties. Stanford was featured on the
editorial pages of The New York
limes, The Wall Street Journal,
the Washington Post and the Los
Angeles Times, among others.
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
who served as head of the Western
Culture program from 1987-89
iiiid went on to head a course in the
Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
grain that replaced it, noted that
both programs were under such in
tense national scrutiny.
"When the program was being
devised in the late 1980s, it became
a matter of a kind of national argu
ment starting in Ihe Wall Street
Journal with big-time American
politicians on both sides," Robin
sou said. "CIV came into bad odor
when it became a kind of political
football at its launching."
Western Culture and CIV were
similar in that they had tracks in
several departments and a com
mon list of readings. In CIV. how
ever, the common reading list was
reduced from 15 to six books and
was made more flexible than the
one in Western Culture.
I he change that attracted the
most attention, however, was ClV's
explicit commitment to multicul
turalism. The 1988 legislation re
quired that every track include
works by "women, minorities and
persons of color," study a non-Eu
ropean c ulture and address topics
of race, gender and c lass.
On tlie same day in 1988, both
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and William
Bennett, the Secretary of Educa
tion under President Ronald Rea
gan, spoke at Stanford on opposing
political sides.
Bennett called Stanford's deci
sion to switch to a less-Eurocentric
course a capitulation to a "cam
paign of pressure politics and in
timidation."
A 1997 article in the Chronicle
of I ligher Education said that CI V
was "hailed by some as the birth of
multicultural education and de
cried by others as the death of the
Western canon."
Asa result of the largely negative
publicity, the course became taint
ed in people's minds, including
those of alumni and donors.
Nevertheless, CIV was going
strong until 1993, when then-Uni
versity President Casper called for
a comprehensive review of under
graduate education, as had been
done 25 years before in 1968. After
three years of deliberation by the
Faculty Senate, the Introduction to
the 11 umanitics program was born.

I-Hum eliminates core list,
