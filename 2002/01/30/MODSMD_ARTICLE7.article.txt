# Drug, alcohol arrests decline
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's alcohol and drug arrest rates decreased
in 2000, despite recently-released Department of Kd
ucation figures showing that national college alcohol
and chug arrest rates were on the rise.
1 he data, compiled from reports by b,209 educa
tional institutions, showed a 4.2-percent nationwide
increase in college alcohol arrests and a 10.2-percent
increase in drug arrests for the year 2000.
Yet Stanford experienced a substantial decrease
in alcohol arrests and a small drop in drug arrests
from 1999 to 2000. According to Stanford Chief of
Police Marvin Moore, there were 45 alcohol-related
on-campus arrests in 2000 versus 78 in 1999, and 1 f>
drug-related arrests in 2000 versus 20 in 1999.
In 1998, Stanford had 75 on-campus alcohol ar
rests and 25 drug arrests, almost identical to the
1999 statisti< s.
Moore confirmed that the nationwide trend clicl
not seem to apply to Stanford.
"In our environment we haven't seen any dra
matic change," he said. "Statistically with our
cases, looking hack from 1998, we generally have
in the neighborhood of 100 alcohol- or drug-relat
ed arrests a year."
While the total arrests dropped by more than a
third from 1999 to 2000, the number increased again
slightly from 2000 to 2001, in which there were 81
on-campus arrests. However, this still represents a
dec t ease from the 1999 numbers.
The government's figures only addressed arrests
through the year 2000.
Moore said that the Depart
ment of Public Safety monitors sta
tistics and looks for trends, but he
stated that the number of arrests
made on campus in the last several
years has not caused concern.
"We're not seeing them in the
quantity that would alarm us," lie*
said.
The Department of Education
also provided data on disciplinary
action taken on campus where
drug or alcohol use did not result
in arrest.
Relative to other similar uni
versities, Stanford logs a substan
tially greater number of drug and
alcohol arrests each year. For ex
ample, in 2000, Stanford regis
tered 61 arrests, whereas Yale,
Harvard, I he University of
Southern California and George
town reported only eight, six, one
and one, respectively.
However, these schools have

substantial numbers of students
who are cited for drugs and alto
hoi each year, whereas Stanford
has none. Government figures
showed that Vale, Harvard, USC
and Georgetown reported three,
80, 10 and !K)2 incidences of on
campus disciplinary action, re
spectively, whereas three vears
worth of data yields not a single in
stance at Stanford.
Health Education Manager
Ralph Castro attributed this to
Stanford's treatment of its stu
dents as adults and noted that the
University does not use resident
assistants to police its students as
many other colleges and universi
ties do.
"At most schools RAs are an
extension of the public safet\
system," he said. "Here they are
an extension of the education
system."
According to the Department
of Education's Web site, usualh
only between 10 and 20 pert cut of
arrests at Stanford are made in the
dormitories.
Moore said that around 20 per
cent of alcohol arrests are there

suit <>! people driving under the
influence, and that these rarely in
volve students.
"We cite tor drunk in public
and minors in possession . . .
I hat's by far the greatest amount of
our enforcement," he said.
Regarding drug use on cam
pus, Moore stated that marijua
na use was on the rise. He also
said that most drug arrests are
made for marijuana or cocaine,
but that the* department has
made some arrests for ecstasy
and inethamphetamines.
Moore attributed the consisten
cy in arrest rates over 11is 28 years
at Stanford to the tvpe of students
the University attracts.
"Students come here with
much more serious attitudes
about their work," he said.
(-astro cited Stanford's educa
tional programs as a factor in min
imizing substance abuse.
"We've created this vibe here at
Stanford where students enjoy
hearing the messages and buy into
the model," he said.
In the last several years, Stan
ford has increased its attention to

education about alcohol and
drug use by creating an Alcohol
Advisory Board, using a grant
from the NCAA to work with ath
letes on alcohol issues and main
taining the role of residential ed
ucation by continuing to educate
resident assistants and peer
health educators.
( '.astro said that it is impossible
to quantitative!) determine what
has caused the decrease in Stan
ford's arrest rate, though he sees
the increased educational out
reach as a possibilitv.
"Anecdotallv, I think we have
seen a change in student percep
tions," he said. "For the most part,
the majority of our students act
very responsibly. We're seeing it
somewhat in the arrest numbers,
.md we're seeing it also in general
behavior."
I n terms of I Diversity policy to
wards alcohol, the only major
change in the last several years was
the 2000 decision announced by
then-Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya that dorm
funds could no longer be used to
buy alcohol.
