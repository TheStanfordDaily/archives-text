### JENNIFER GRAHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's alcohol and drug arrest rates decreased
in 2000, despite recently-released Department of Kd
ucation figures showing that national college alcohol
and chug arrest rates were on the rise.
1 he data, compiled from reports by b,209 educa
tional institutions, showed a 4.2-percent nationwide
increase in college alcohol arrests and a 10.2-percent
increase in drug arrests for the year 2000.
Yet Stanford experienced a substantial decrease
in alcohol arrests and a small drop in drug arrests
from 1999 to 2000. According to Stanford Chief of
Police Marvin Moore, there were 45 alcohol-related
on-campus arrests in 2000 versus 78 in 1999, and 1 f>
drug-related arrests in 2000 versus 20 in 1999.
In 1998, Stanford had 75 on-campus alcohol ar
rests and 25 drug arrests, almost identical to the
1999 statisti< s.
Moore confirmed that the nationwide trend clicl
not seem to apply to Stanford.
"In our environment we haven't seen any dra
matic change," he said. "Statistically with our
cases, looking hack from 1998, we generally have
in the neighborhood of 100 alcohol- or drug-relat
ed arrests a year."
While the total arrests dropped by more than a
third from 1999 to 2000, the number increased again
slightly from 2000 to 2001, in which there were 81
on-campus arrests. However, this still represents a
dec t ease from the 1999 numbers.
The government's figures only addressed arrests
