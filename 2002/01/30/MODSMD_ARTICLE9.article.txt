## Issues of Substance 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is tile last in
a series examining the issues facing
hast Palo Alto. Today, we look at the
connection betu'een drug use at Stan
ford and drug dealing in the small city
that lies two miles from <ambus.

lii 1992, the violent crime rate
in East Palo Alto — largely fueled
by drug- and gang-related vio
lence— peaked with 42 murders
in the city of 24,000. That year,
the community was dubbed the
country's "murder capital."
Since the early 19905, the East
Palo Alto Police

Department has
clamped down
on drug-related
crime. The vio
lent crime rate
was halved In the
end of the
decade, accord-

ing to the Rand Institute, and
only one murder was rep(>rted in
1999, the last year for which sta
tistics are available.
But members of surrounding
communities — including Stan
ford students — say they know
that East Palo Alto remains the
place to buy illegal drugs.
"Everyone knows that East
Palo Alto is a drug haven. East
Palo Alto resident Henr\ Salas
said.
However, labeling East Palo
Alto a "drug haven" doesn't tell
the whole story.
Although East Palo Alto is fre
quently blamed for its drug prob
lem, Rose Jacobs. San Mateo
County supervisor and former
East Palo Alto c ity counc ilwoman,
told tlu- San Jose Mercury News
that "all of the consuming wasn't
being done there .... Lots of
purchasers were coming in from
Palo Alto and Menlo Park. In fact,
there was more selling going on
in East Palo Alto than ac tual using
of the drugs."

EPA provides a local market
For the impoverished com
munity of East Palo Alto, which
has an average income of
$15,028, according to the Associ
ated Press, the $60-per-gram
market price of'cocaine can entice
many to go into the drug trade.
East Palo Alto drug dealers
provide an easy outlet for Stan
ford students who wish to pur
chase illegal substances; some
dealers even deliver to campus,
reports a Stanford undergradu
ate who uses cocaine, and who
asked not to be identified.
"Most people buy their drugs
from East Palo Alto," he said.

' 1 have four
dealers in East
Palo Alto.
Friends gave
me their names,
and some deal
ers gave me
other contacts,"

lie continued.
According to East Palo Alto Po
lice Lieutenant Ron Sibley , deal
ers within the city generallyoffer
a full line of drugs.
" Hut met hamphetimines,
heroine and ( rack are the most
common drugs in the cit\." Sib
ley said.
Siblev said the police de
partment knows that college
students come into the town to
bu\ drugs, but that citizens of
other surrounding conuuuni-
I ies also use East Palo Alto deal
ers as their suppliers.
"We've run some reverse sting
programs where officers sell
drugs." he said. "We've arrested
people, including some rocket
scientists from NASA."
Stanford Public Safetv officials
note that there is also a second
pattern for obtaining drugs on
campus.
"Students frequently buy
drugs from other students who
have connections higher up tlie

drug chain," Public Safety Lieu
tenant I .aura Wilson saicl.
Wilson saicl that generally drug
suppliers, such as one they arrested
out of Sonoma last vear, are based in
rural areas. But she added that
"Kast PiiloAlto certainh has a repu
tation [for drug dealingj.'
One student agreed that the
local origin of much of the drugs
dealt on campus is l.ast Palo.Alto.
"I think a lot ol the drugs come
from East Palo Alto," said a junior
majoring in Symbolic Systems. "I
also heard there's a bunker there."
Salas said ili.it he worried about
the wealthy young people who
come into East Palo Alto to buy
drugs.
"You see people in suits — these
people are subjecting themselves to
dealers who will hurt them.
Overdoses increase at Stanford
Public Safety officials report that
students seem to be overdosing on
illegal drugs more frequently now
than they have in recent years.
"It's not onh drugs but also alco
hol," Wilson said. "But it might not
be a negative thing that we are re
ceiving more reports of
overdoses — students could be ( ail
ing us more."
He added that students usually
don't report overdoses to the police
department.
"Students, as you prohablv
know, prett\ much try to keep the
police out of matters," she said.
"Peoplecall loi paramedic response
and we come along."
Marijuana and Ecstas\ are the
most commonly used drugs on
campus, ac cording to Wilson.
Students say thev normally use
drugs with a small group of 'friends.
A sophomore who casualK uses
marijuana said, "when i use it on
campus it is definitely with a small,
intimate group of people, like one
or two friends."
Wilson said the Police Depart
ment knows about drug use on
campus but generally does not
make a lot of arrests.
"We know it's happening, and
we know it's happening in the
dorms and at parties," she said.
"But to be honest, we don't make a
lot of drug arrests. We typically
only get called when someone has
overdosed."
Overdoses are infrequent, oc
curring only every couple ol
months, and are handled on a case

in-case basis, Wilson saicl.
Recently, however, there were
two overdoses in one month.
"We just had a case recently
when a student overdosed where
there were no criminal charges
brought," she said. "In this case, the
student's parents came and took
him home and he got the help that
he needed."
Yet in the same month there was
a tragic ending to a similar story.
"We did just have a student die
from an overdose in the c ity. That
made it two in one month," she
added.
East Palo Alto Police fight back
I lie East Palo Alto Police De
partment reported that it normally
uses traditional tactics in order to
c tub drug dealing in the citv.
"Our tactics are basicalK tradi
tional as far .is frisking people hang
ing on the corners and using infor
mants to make buys," Sibley saicl.
But what is innovative about the
Police Department's anti-drug el-
Ibrts is its community involvement
component.
"Most importandy, we have en
gaged the community. 'I'hey call us
all the time and give us informa
tion," Sibley saicl.
Sible\ noted that violence stems
frc>in cc>mpetii i< >11 amc>ng clealers.
"It's about the location of the
dav." he said. "Everyone shows up
where the c ustomers are and they
sell their wares."
Although some users prefer the
convenience of having drugs deliv
ered to their house or dorm, Sibley
s,»icl this practice can be dangerous.
I lie department's c rime sup
pression squad, which is operated
through the San Mateo County
Sheriffs Office, regularly patrols
the two or three drug "hoLspoLs" in
the city, Sibley saicl.
But this enforcement can be
sp<iradic.
I'he I'.tlo Alto Weekly reported
that during December, the crime
suppression squad was not active
because of stalling issues.
'A safe place to experiment'
Some students sav that the rela
tive lac k of enforcement of drug
laws on campus is positive, because
it allows students to make choices
for themselves.
"I think security is understand
ably loose around here," said a
sophomore who describes herself as
a "casual marijuana user," and who
obtains her drugs from her Bay
Area hometown. " I'he beauty about
Stanford is that it is a sale place to ex
periment."
