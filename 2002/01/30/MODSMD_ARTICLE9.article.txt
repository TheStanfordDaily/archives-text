Editors Note: This article is tile last in
a series examining the issues facing
hast Palo Alto. Today, we look at the
connection betu'een drug use at Stan
ford and drug dealing in the small city
that lies two miles from <ambus.

lii 1992, the violent crime rate
in East Palo Alto — largely fueled
by drug- and gang-related vio
lence— peaked with 42 murders
in the city of 24,000. That year,
the community was dubbed the
country's "murder capital."
Since the early 19905, the East
Palo Alto Police

Department has
clamped down
on drug-related
crime. The vio
lent crime rate
was halved In the
end of the
decade, accord-

ing to the Rand Institute, and
only one murder was rep(>rted in
1999, the last year for which sta
tistics are available.
But members of surrounding
communities — including Stan
ford students — say they know
that East Palo Alto remains the
place to buy illegal drugs.
"Everyone knows that East
Palo Alto is a drug haven. East
Palo Alto resident Henr\ Salas
said.
However, labeling East Palo
Alto a "drug haven" doesn't tell
the whole story.
Although East Palo Alto is fre
quently blamed for its drug prob

County supervisor and former
East Palo Alto c ity counc ilwoman,

that "all of the consuming wasn't
being done there .... Lots of
purchasers were coming in from
Palo Alto and Menlo Park. In fact,
there was more selling going on
in East Palo Alto than ac tual using
of the drugs."

has an average income of
$15,028, according to the Associ

East Palo Alto drug dealers
provide an easy outlet for Stan

asked not to be identified.
"Most people buy their drugs
from East Palo Alto," he said.

dealers in East

According to East Palo Alto Po

ers within the city generallyoffer
a full line of drugs.
" Hut met hamphetimines,
heroine and ( rack are the most
common drugs in the cit\." Sib
ley said.
Siblev said the police de

students come into the town to
bu\ drugs, but that citizens of
other surrounding conuuuni-

ers as their suppliers.
"We've run some reverse sting
programs where officers sell
drugs." he said. "We've arrested
people, including some rocket
scientists from NASA."
Stanford Public Safetv officials
