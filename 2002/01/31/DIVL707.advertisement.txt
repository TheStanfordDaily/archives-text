A leading voice in America's Asian community
tackles what it means to be Asian American today.
Often provocative and always thoughtful, this book
addresses some of the most controversial
contemporary issues: discrimination, immigration,
diversity, globalization, and the mixed-race
movement, introducing the example of Asian
Americans to shed new light on the current
debates. Combining personal anecdotes,
social-science research, legal cases, history, and
original journalistic reporting, Wu discusses
damaging Asian American stereotypes such as
"the model minority "and" the perpetual foreigner."
By offering new ways of thinking about race in
American society, VAi's work challenges us to
make good on our great democratic experiment.
