## The 						Stanford Daily Housed frats must provide campus benefits 
### 
Published Since IX') I

Yesterday, the Office of Residential
Education announced that two
fraternities would be receiving
row houses within the next two
years. Phi Psi will receive the old DKE
house at 592 Mayfield as of next fall, while
Sigma Nu will be housed in 557 beginning
in the fall of 2003. We support this decision
of Residential Education because it bal
ances the needs of these groups with the
rest of the student body.
Res Ed's granting of Row housing to
Greek organizations is an important and con
troversial decision in the eyes of the student
body. Because the housing of these fraterni
ties in 592 and 557 means that fewer students

will have the opportunity to live on the Row,
it is important that the fraternities provide
social benefits for the campus that regular
Row houses would not. These fraternities
must not fall into the trap of complacency
that has prevented some housed campus fra
ternities from hosting educational programs
or parties for the entire campus.
The new fraternity houses have the poten
tial to become social hubs for campus in ways
that regular Row houses are not. When
members of different Draw groups do not in
teract, the house remains a desirable place to
live, but ceases to be a campus social area.
When this happens, and residents lose the
desire to organize house events such as bar

becues and parties, the potential fora house
full of students in a central campus location
to provide a social outlet is wasted.
Fraternities, on the other hand, are inher
ently social organizations, whose members
are expected by ResEd as well as the greater
campus to provide social activities for stu
dents. With fraternity houses on the Row,
there will be year-to-year continuity and thus
a distinct llavor to each house.
As the number of housed fraternities on
the Row increases from one to three, the
chances that various Stanford students will
find enough common interests with members
of a housed Row fraternity greatly increases.
Already, Phi Psi members have discussed

the possibility of holding regular live music
performances. This is a good example of an
open event the group would need a house
based setting to put on. The size of the 592
first floor area and back patio make the house
conducive to such events.
Understandably, some students will be
upset to learn that two Greek organizations
have been given housing on the Row. They
will feel that their chances to live in a Row
house have been lessened and they have cer
tainly lost something.
But if these new fraternities can provide
productive, fun, social and educational activ
ities in a central location, the overall gain for
the campus will far outweigh the loss.
