# RAREFIED AIR
## A 						masters marathon 
### 
I am not exact.l) what vou would call a
typical runner. I'm dreadfully out ol
shape and pitifully slow. In fact, I real
ly don't run so much as I shuffle along
at something slightly above a walk. Still, 1
can't get over the lad that sweating mv wa\
through a few miles makes me feel strange
ly good.
But lately, I've been having motivational
problems. I fomework consumes m\ nights,
and sleep deprivation keeps me beneath the

sheets until the last possi
ble moment in the morn
ings. I needed a boost. I
needed incentive.
So last Sunday, I ran in
my first road nice ever, a 5K
jaunt through (.olden (>ate
I'ark. It was Ixitli fun and
painful, filled with highs
and lows, but with a happ\
i: .. .1 i:i

ending — a successful finish line crossing.
I thought that was the end of the story,
until I silt down to write my final column for
112 lu- Daily. 1 hat's when 1 realized that Sun
day wasn't the first time I had found some
thing in life that followed that pattern. Slow
ly, I repeated in\ summarvof the race: "Lei's
see ... fun but painful... highs and lows ...
happ\ ending." Suddenly, I realized that ni\
road race summary also offers an uncannv
description of the entire graduate s< liool ex
perience.
I can condense everything I've learned
in my first four months at Stanford into a
single observation: graduate school will
never be anything like you expected. It's
surprisingly like a race, and goes something
like my experience on Sunday:
Mileo (September): I'm surrounded In a
sea of strangers. Some are young, some arc
old. Some of them are wearing funny
clothes, and others are talking in weird lan
guages. I have no idea w liet her thev're good
runners or bad runners, though I assume
they must be prett\ good (oi at least willing
to work hard) if the\ bothered to enter the
race in the first place. I feel slightl\ nervous
and wonder if entering tins thing wasa good
idea after all.
Mile 0.2 (Karly ()< tober): 1 ley, this isn't
so bad. I can do this, no piohlcnio, piece of
cake. I here are a few people in 112 ront of me,
but I can deal with th.it. And these people
that I'm running with are very friendh and
encouraging. We even tell eac hot hern joke
or two. Left, right, left eight. I'm doing well
in the middle of the pack. I .ook at me go!
Mile 0.5 (Fall Midterms): ()w ow ow.
(iood I.ord, this is painful. Forget every
thing I e\er said about this In-ing easy.
Maylx-1 should have spent a little more lime
stretching In-fore the race.
Mile 0.8 ( I hanksgiving): Ahh. Now this
is nice. I'm starting to forget that pain a few

lentils ol a mile back, and settling into a
com lion able pace. Adrenaline-inspired
thoughts of finding another race to run
next weekend till my head.
Mile 1 (Finals): Uphill. I gh. I can't keep
up with the blistering pace of the leaders
and tall behind. I lappil). there is a sizeable
group of slightl\ slower runners, and I am
able to fall right in step with them.
Mile I.I (Christmas Break): I'm in a state
of complete bliss as I crest the hill and see a
long downhill segment sti ck hingbefore me.
All hints of pain disappear and I enjoy the
cool morning air. the compam of mv fellow
runners and the light feeling of my feet pat
tering along the road. I want to stay in this
state forever.
Mile 1.3 (January): Unfortunately, my
downhill trek ends as the road flattens out
and I prepare for a chills stretch ol flat,
straight pavement. I'm not looking lorward
to this part, but at least the first mile of the
race has forced me to adjust to the ever
changing conditions of the road. I hold out
hopes of picking up my pace and gaining a
little ground.
Mile 1.5 (February): Still alive, and still
plodding along. I've hit a nicest rideand feel
like I can handle practically am pain that
ni\ body tries to throw m\ way. My fellow
runners and I have figured out that if we
sti< k together, we can draw some energx
and motivation from eac h other. It's a nice
feeling. I'm visualizing the finish line, and to
my surprise, it has started to come nicely
into focus.
So here I am, 1.5 miles into a projected
!'>. I. still following mv left foot with my right
foot .. . halfwa\ to getting a Master's degree
from Stanford. I know that this quarter's
midterms and finals will again test my
willpower and commitment to gracl school,
just like another hill around Mile 2 made me
again wonder how crazy I had been to enter
a rac e. And maybe in May some of those
Ph.D. students will finish their theses and
make my year-long M.S. look downright
silly in comparison, just like the half
marathon leaders who were finishing their
sixth mile in the lane next to me as I slogged
to the end of my third mile.
but I also know that my stint in gracl
school will progress toward a |une date
with graduation, just like I pounded my
way clown the road to the finish line on
Sunday. I will be proud of my accomplish
ment. And this year, that will be enough.

112 lu- Daily. 1 hat's when 1 realized that Sun
day wasn't the first time I had found some
thing in life that followed that pattern. Slow
ly, I repeated in\ summarvof the race: "Lei's
see ... fun but painful... highs and lows ...
happ\ ending." Suddenly, I realized that ni\
road race summary also offers an uncannv
description of the entire graduate s< liool ex
perience.
I can condense everything I've learned
in my first four months at Stanford into a
single observation: graduate school will
never be anything like you expected. It's
surprisingly like a race, and goes something
like my experience on Sunday:
Mileo (September): I'm surrounded In a
sea of strangers. Some are young, some arc
old. Some of them are wearing funny
clothes, and others are talking in weird lan
guages. I have no idea w liet her thev're good
runners or bad runners, though I assume
they must be prett\ good (oi at least willing
to work hard) if the\ bothered to enter the
race in the first place. I feel slightl\ nervous
and wonder if entering tins thing wasa good
idea after all.
Mile 0.2 (Karly ()< tober): 1 ley, this isn't
so bad. I can do this, no piohlcnio, piece of
cake. I here are a few people in 112 ront of me,
but I can deal with th.it. And these people
that I'm running with are very friendh and
encouraging. We even tell eac hot hern joke
or two. Left, right, left eight. I'm doing well
in the middle of the pack. I .ook at me go!
Mile 0.5 (Fall Midterms): ()w ow ow.
(iood I.ord, this is painful. Forget every
thing I e\er said about this In-ing easy.
Maylx-1 should have spent a little more lime
stretching In-fore the race.
Mile 0.8 ( I hanksgiving): Ahh. Now this
is nice. I'm starting to forget that pain a few

lentils ol a mile back, and settling into a
com lion able pace. Adrenaline-inspired
thoughts of finding another race to run
next weekend till my head.
Mile 1 (Finals): Uphill. I gh. I can't keep
up with the blistering pace of the leaders
and tall behind. I lappil). there is a sizeable
group of slightl\ slower runners, and I am
able to fall right in step with them.
Mile I.I (Christmas Break): I'm in a state
of complete bliss as I crest the hill and see a
long downhill segment sti ck hingbefore me.
All hints of pain disappear and I enjoy the
cool morning air. the compam of mv fellow
runners and the light feeling of my feet pat
tering along the road. I want to stay in this
state forever.
Mile 1.3 (January): Unfortunately, my
downhill trek ends as the road flattens out
and I prepare for a chills stretch ol flat,
straight pavement. I'm not looking lorward
to this part, but at least the first mile of the
race has forced me to adjust to the ever
changing conditions of the road. I hold out
hopes of picking up my pace and gaining a
little ground.
Mile 1.5 (February): Still alive, and still
plodding along. I've hit a nicest rideand feel
like I can handle practically am pain that
ni\ body tries to throw m\ way. My fellow
runners and I have figured out that if we
sti< k together, we can draw some energx
and motivation from eac h other. It's a nice
feeling. I'm visualizing the finish line, and to
my surprise, it has started to come nicely
into focus.
So here I am, 1.5 miles into a projected
!'>. I. still following mv left foot with my right
foot .. . halfwa\ to getting a Master's degree
from Stanford. I know that this quarter's
midterms and finals will again test my
willpower and commitment to gracl school,
just like another hill around Mile 2 made me
again wonder how crazy I had been to enter
a rac e. And maybe in May some of those
Ph.D. students will finish their theses and
make my year-long M.S. look downright
silly in comparison, just like the half
marathon leaders who were finishing their
sixth mile in the lane next to me as I slogged
to the end of my third mile.
but I also know that my stint in gracl
school will progress toward a |une date
with graduation, just like I pounded my
way clown the road to the finish line on
Sunday. I will be proud of my accomplish
ment. And this year, that will be enough.

I am not exact.l) what vou would call a
typical runner. I'm dreadfully out ol
shape and pitifully slow. In fact, I real

at something slightly above a walk. Still, 1
can't get over the lad that sweating mv wa\
through a few miles makes me feel strange

problems. I fomework consumes m\ nights,
