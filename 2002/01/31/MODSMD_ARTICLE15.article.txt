Kamenetsky 'misconstrued our argument'
In his letter to the editor Max Kamenet
sky misunderstood and misconstrued our
argument, first, Kamenetsky states that we
attacked I"he Daily for publishing the news
story. I his is completely false. We criticized
the Daily not lot publishing the story but
lot framing it in a way that perpetuates
stereotypes demeaning to homeless peo
ple.
Second, Kamenetsky recounts the lads
about the homeless woman as if we denied
that she was unhygenic and that she was
trespassing. We realize and acknowledge
these facts and never set out to counter
them. However, we do not think that the
homeless woman should have been sym
bolically equated with a louse descending
upon Branner.
Ihe Daily, whether it intended to or not,
madethisequation when it used the picture
that it did. More broadly, nowhere in our
response did we criticize how Stanford han
dled the incident. We never argued that
the homeless woman should not have been
removed, or that Stanford should open its
doors to the homeless of the area.
We simply stated that I he Daily's spin
on the incident was myopic in that it fo
cused only on how Stanford students were
inconvenienced and not on the larger issue
of homelessness.
Kamenetsky"s final hope is that we realize
that "the answer to the homeless problem
docs not lie in inviting the homeless to steal
shampoo from the student dorm while in
fecting the population with head lice."
Kamenetsky can rest assured because we
never proposed that as a solution.
What we do propose is that 1 he Daily's
reporting encourage the Stanford commu
nity to think outside of its bubble and that
Kamenetsky understand the arguments he
responds to before misrepresenting them.

A comment on Kaara Baptiste's letter
I want to comment on Kaara Baptiste's
letter to I he Daily about the lice-infected
homeless trespasser. She claims that it is
important for us to understand the "des
peration and hopelessness" that led a
homeless person to intrude on Stanford's
property. Sure, people understood that
the woman was desperate and hopeless.
They also understood that it's generally a
bad idea to be around desperate, hopeless
people. Especially desperate, hopeless
people with lice.
Baptiste also claims that it is a "bla
tant, uninformed stereotype" to claim
that homeless people are generally men
tally disturbed and / or criminals. Now,
a stereotype is an unjustified generaliza
tion. Unfortunately, many choose to call
unwelcome facts "stereotypes." For ex
ample, if I were to point out that ap
proximately 54 percent of homeless
people have a history of incarceration,
or that M percent have alcohol, drug or
mental health problems, I would be pil
loried for that most unconscionable of
fense of trafficking in facts — ahem,
stereotypes. Even if I were to point out
that the data is from the Department of
11 call hand 11 uman Services — hardly a
tight wing think-tank — such facts
would become mere speedbumps on the
road to moral outrage.
But that's what happens when the "con
cerned" can always claim the moral high
ground. I wonder if Baptiste would retain
her concern if she came home to find this
same woman going through her property.
I'm willing to bet she would suspend it until
after the police arrived.

Regional dialects aren't 'foreign accents'
I w;»s very pleased to read about the I it
erated lx*arninir system for converting

speech to text.
I lowever, I feel one correction is neces
sary. The story mentioned special versions
of the software for "users with significant
foreign accents," such as "Australian or
British Knglish".
It really isn't proper to label regional
varieties of a language, used by native
speakers, as "foreign accents". I his term,
as I understand it, refers only to the kinds
of errors in pronunciation, vocabulary
and grammar that are characteristic of
non-native speakers.
It may well be the case that the LL
software needs to be customized to rec
ognize an Aussie's rendition of "g'day",
or my own (()ntario, (lanada) pronunci
ation of "out and about" — but these are
regional accents, dialects or variations,
not "foreign accents". "Knglish speakers
from other countries" might have been a
better term.

same woman going through her property.
I'm willing to bet she would suspend it until
after the police arrived.

Regional dialects aren't 'foreign accents'
I w;»s very pleased to read about the I it
erated lx*arninir system for converting

speech to text.
I lowever, I feel one correction is neces
sary. The story mentioned special versions
of the software for "users with significant
foreign accents," such as "Australian or
British Knglish".
It really isn't proper to label regional
varieties of a language, used by native
speakers, as "foreign accents". I his term,
as I understand it, refers only to the kinds
of errors in pronunciation, vocabulary
and grammar that are characteristic of
non-native speakers.
It may well be the case that the LL
software needs to be customized to rec
ognize an Aussie's rendition of "g'day",
or my own (()ntario, (lanada) pronunci
ation of "out and about" — but these are
regional accents, dialects or variations,
not "foreign accents". "Knglish speakers
from other countries" might have been a
better term.

Kamenetsky 'misconstrued our argument'
In his letter to the editor Max Kamenet
sky misunderstood and misconstrued our
argument, first, Kamenetsky states that we
attacked I"he Daily for publishing the news
story. I his is completely false. We criticized
the Daily not lot publishing the story but
lot framing it in a way that perpetuates
stereotypes demeaning to homeless peo
ple.
Second, Kamenetsky recounts the lads
about the homeless woman as if we denied
that she was unhygenic and that she was
trespassing. We realize and acknowledge
these facts and never set out to counter
them. However, we do not think that the
homeless woman should have been sym
bolically equated with a louse descending
upon Branner.
Ihe Daily, whether it intended to or not,
madethisequation when it used the picture
that it did. More broadly, nowhere in our
response did we criticize how Stanford han
dled the incident. We never argued that
the homeless woman should not have been
removed, or that Stanford should open its
doors to the homeless of the area.
We simply stated that I he Daily's spin
on the incident was myopic in that it fo
cused only on how Stanford students were
inconvenienced and not on the larger issue
of homelessness.
Kamenetsky"s final hope is that we realize
that "the answer to the homeless problem
docs not lie in inviting the homeless to steal
shampoo from the student dorm while in
fecting the population with head lice."
Kamenetsky can rest assured because we
never proposed that as a solution.
What we do propose is that 1 he Daily's
reporting encourage the Stanford commu
nity to think outside of its bubble and that
Kamenetsky understand the arguments he
responds to before misrepresenting them.

A comment on Kaara Baptiste's letter
I want to comment on Kaara Baptiste's
letter to I he Daily about the lice-infected
homeless trespasser. She claims that it is
important for us to understand the "des
peration and hopelessness" that led a
homeless person to intrude on Stanford's
property. Sure, people understood that
the woman was desperate and hopeless.
They also understood that it's generally a
bad idea to be around desperate, hopeless
people. Especially desperate, hopeless
people with lice.
Baptiste also claims that it is a "bla
tant, uninformed stereotype" to claim
that homeless people are generally men
tally disturbed and / or criminals. Now,
a stereotype is an unjustified generaliza
tion. Unfortunately, many choose to call
unwelcome facts "stereotypes." For ex
ample, if I were to point out that ap
proximately 54 percent of homeless
people have a history of incarceration,
or that M percent have alcohol, drug or
mental health problems, I would be pil
loried for that most unconscionable of
fense of trafficking in facts — ahem,
stereotypes. Even if I were to point out
that the data is from the Department of
11 call hand 11 uman Services — hardly a
tight wing think-tank — such facts
would become mere speedbumps on the
road to moral outrage.
But that's what happens when the "con
cerned" can always claim the moral high
ground. I wonder if Baptiste would retain
her concern if she came home to find this
same woman going through her property.
I'm willing to bet she would suspend it until
after the police arrived.
