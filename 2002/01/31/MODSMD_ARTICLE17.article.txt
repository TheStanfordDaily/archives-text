## After two title-less years, No. 1 Baseball wonders if It's in the Cards 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At Sunken Diamond stand
two flagpoles commemorating
the baseball program's back-to
back National Championships
in 1987 and 1988. As nice as
they look, one can't help but get
the feeling that another pair
should complement them on
the first base line.
The two "missing" flags now
fly in Baton Rouge and Miami,
the homes of the two teams
that ended the Cardinal's past
two seasons with losses, hugs
and tears rather than wins, dog
piles and rings. Despite three
consecutive trips to Omaha
and two second-place trophies,
the business at hand remains
unfinished.
Every position player that
started in last year's College
World Series championship
game returns this season, rais
ing expectations for the unani
mous preseason No. 1 and in
tensifying the Cardinal's
hunger to finish what it started
over the past three seasons.

commences tomorrow night at
home against No. 15 Cal State-
Fullerton.
The veteran group that
comes back to don the Stanford
pullover jerseys starkly con
trasts with the tin proven squad
that began the 2001 season after
losing six position starters and
its top three starting pitchers.
"We're kind of the opposite
of last year because we have a lot
more experienced players,"
said head coach Mark Mar
quess, in his 26th season at the
helm of Stanford baseball.
With seven spots in the line
up practically set, Marquess has
the luxury of bringing one of his
most talented freshman classes
ever along slowly. I lowever, the
freshmen wonVsit for long â€”
and in some cases not at all.
Enter Mark Jccman, a 6-foot
9, 230-pound hurler that comes
to the "Farm as one of its most
promising recruits to date. Mar
quess expects Jecman to begin
the season as the team's third
starter, a tough task for any
young pitcher in collegiate
baseball. But the Diamond Bar,
