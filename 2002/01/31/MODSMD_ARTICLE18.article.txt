# Earning its highest preseason ranking ever, No. 3 Softball has its...
## Eyes on the Prize 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
"This is the year we are going to
do it," said senior Jessica Mendoza.
The three time Ail-American
center-fielder is not the only one
who believes in the No. 3 Cardinal
Softball squad. The team received
its highest preseason national
ranking in Stanford history for
the 2002 season. After earning its
first trip to the Women's College
World Series in 2001, the Cardi
nal has its sights set on the ulti
mate goal.
The mission this year is clear,
and the path to the National
Championship promises to prove
as tough as usual.
For the past four months the
Stanford Softball program has
been preparing physically, men
tally and emotionally for the 65-
game season ahead.
The Cardinal will once again
be competing in the Pacific 10
Conference, the most grueling
conference in the nation. In fact,
the top three teams in the country
— Arizona, UCLA and Stanford
— are also the top three teams in
the conference.
"The Pac-10 is going to be
tough this year as always," said ju
nior Dana Sorensen. "It is going to
be a tight race between UCLA, Ari
zona, Washington, California and
us. Conference is going to be like
playing World Series-type games
every weekend."
The Cardinal is up for the
challenge.

The team returns seven
starters, three veteran pitchers,
three ail-Americans and a new
sense of confidence.
"We are a lot more mature this
year," Sorensen said. "We have
nine upperclassmen, and because
we have been to the World Series
we are more experienced and
know what to expect."

The team's confidence is
echoed by head coach John
Rittman.
"Anytime you have a veteran
squad it is going to help you," Ik*
said. "Our four seniors provide
great leadership. Whenever you
have those three ingredients of
maturity, experience and talent,
you are going to be capable of
great things."
The Stanford squad will look to
the bats of seniors Jessica Mendo/a
and Sarah Beeson to lead them at
the plate. Both All-Americans
completed tremendous offensive

seasons last year and are eager to
kick off the 2002 campaign. Men
doza completed her third success
ful year in the box, averaging .405
with 14 homeruns, 70 runs scored
and 31 stolen bases.
Following .Mendoza in the
lineup is not an easy job — for
most. Beeson made No. 22 a
number to fear last year, knock-

ing in 66 RBI, 79 hits and 23 dou
bles. While Mendoza and Beeson
will be forces to reckon with this
season, the entire Stanford squad
promises to lay the pressure on
the opposing defense.
"()ur whole lineup is capable of
hitting the ball," Mendoza said.
"Everyone is doing really well in
practice. Not only is one through
nine going to be able to produce
t his year, there are going to be peo
ple on the bench that will be able to
produce as well."
The depth of talent at the plate
this season will be matched by the

Cardinal pitching staff.
"We are one of the top teams
in the country [concerning pitch
ing]," Sorensen said. "We have a
lot of depth. Most teams have
one or two strong pitchers, and
we have three equally capable
pitchers."
Stanford's winningest pitcher is
two time Ail-American Sorensen,
who tore through her sophomore
season shattering the single-season
strike out record with 295 Ks and
finishing with a record of 27-5.
Sophomores Maureen LeCocq
and Tori Nyberg turned out very
strong performances on the rub
ber in 2001 as well. LeCocq made
30 appearances including one per
fect game and Nyberg came in to
record two saves and six victories.
Like the Cardinal pitching staff,
the solid Stanford defense will suf
fer little change. Former third
baseman and right fielder, Jenni
Shideler and Ramona Shelburne,
respectively, will be missed, but
four freshmen with a tough offsea
son behind them will be eager to
contribute this year.
" The leadership of Jenni and
Ramona will be missed," Nyberg
said. "But we have some good
freshmen and some people that
were not in the starting lineup last
year that are ready to step up."

The depth of talent at the plate
this season will be matched by the

Cardinal pitching staff.
"We are one of the top teams
in the country [concerning pitch
ing]," Sorensen said. "We have a
lot of depth. Most teams have
one or two strong pitchers, and
we have three equally capable
pitchers."
Stanford's winningest pitcher is
two time Ail-American Sorensen,
who tore through her sophomore
season shattering the single-season
strike out record with 295 Ks and
finishing with a record of 27-5.
Sophomores Maureen LeCocq
and Tori Nyberg turned out very
strong performances on the rub
ber in 2001 as well. LeCocq made
30 appearances including one per
fect game and Nyberg came in to
record two saves and six victories.
Like the Cardinal pitching staff,
the solid Stanford defense will suf
fer little change. Former third
baseman and right fielder, Jenni
Shideler and Ramona Shelburne,
respectively, will be missed, but
four freshmen with a tough offsea
son behind them will be eager to
contribute this year.
" The leadership of Jenni and
Ramona will be missed," Nyberg
said. "But we have some good
freshmen and some people that
were not in the starting lineup last
year that are ready to step up."

"What makes this team special
is that we are strong in so many
areas," Kittman said. "Our pitch
ing, defense and our ability to
score runs make us an excellent
team. We just need to put these
things together."

Stanford is confident in its abili
ties, but it still reali/cs it has a job to

" I he only ranking that matters

Kidman said.
"This is the year we are going to
do it," said senior Jessica Mendoza.
The three time Ail-American
center-fielder is not the only one
who believes in the No. 3 Cardinal
Softball squad. The team received
its highest preseason national
ranking in Stanford history for
the 2002 season. After earning its
first trip to the Women's College
World Series in 2001, the Cardi
nal has its sights set on the ulti
mate goal.
The mission this year is clear,
and the path to the National
Championship promises to prove
as tough as usual.
For the past four months the
Stanford Softball program has
been preparing physically, men
tally and emotionally for the 65-
game season ahead.
The Cardinal will once again
be competing in the Pacific 10
Conference, the most grueling
conference in the nation. In fact,
the top three teams in the country
— Arizona, UCLA and Stanford
— are also the top three teams in
the conference.
"The Pac-10 is going to be
tough this year as always," said ju
nior Dana Sorensen. "It is going to
be a tight race between UCLA, Ari
zona, Washington, California and
us. Conference is going to be like
playing World Series-type games
every weekend."
The Cardinal is up for the
challenge.

The team returns seven
starters, three veteran pitchers,
three ail-Americans and a new
sense of confidence.
"We are a lot more mature this
year," Sorensen said. "We have
nine upperclassmen, and because
we have been to the World Series
we are more experienced and
know what to expect."

The team's confidence is
echoed by head coach John
Rittman.
"Anytime you have a veteran
squad it is going to help you," Ik*
said. "Our four seniors provide
great leadership. Whenever you
have those three ingredients of
maturity, experience and talent,
you are going to be capable of
great things."
The Stanford squad will look to
the bats of seniors Jessica Mendo/a
and Sarah Beeson to lead them at
the plate. Both All-Americans
completed tremendous offensive

seasons last year and are eager to
kick off the 2002 campaign. Men
doza completed her third success
ful year in the box, averaging .405
with 14 homeruns, 70 runs scored
and 31 stolen bases.
Following .Mendoza in the
lineup is not an easy job — for
most. Beeson made No. 22 a
number to fear last year, knock-

ing in 66 RBI, 79 hits and 23 dou
bles. While Mendoza and Beeson
will be forces to reckon with this
season, the entire Stanford squad
promises to lay the pressure on
the opposing defense.
"()ur whole lineup is capable of
hitting the ball," Mendoza said.
"Everyone is doing really well in
practice. Not only is one through
nine going to be able to produce
t his year, there are going to be peo
ple on the bench that will be able to
produce as well."
