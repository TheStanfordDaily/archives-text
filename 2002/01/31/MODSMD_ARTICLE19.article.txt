# Tennis makes second try at opening season
## No. 1 tennis opens play on the Farm after it was rained out last week 
### MARK THOMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the No. 1
women's tennis team (1-0) will
begin its 2002 dual match season
again.
The Cardinal was set to play
No. 1 1 Fresno State (1-0) last Sat
urday, but thunderstorms pre
vented the team from whetting its
appetite for team play.
The University of the Pacific
(1-0) comes to town on Thursday
fora 1:30 match, and Stanford
will travel to sunny Malibu to take
on No. 24 Pepperdine (1-2) at
noon on Saturday.
"We're all excited about get
ting started," senior Gabby Lastra
said. "It was a little disappointing
getting rained out, but it gave us
more time to prepare for our next
opponent."
The unranked Tigers should
prove an easier opening foe than
the Bulldogs would have been.
Last year at home, Stanford dis
patched Pacific 7-0.
Pacific has only played one
dual match this year, but they
made it last, defeating UC-I)avis
5-2 on Saturday in a match that
lasted six hours. Rain forced the
teams indoors, where there were
only three courts.
Stanford has only two indoor
courts, so moving last Satur
day's match indoors was not a

realistic possibility.
Pepperdine got off to a fast
start this year, blanking San Diego
7-0 on the road, but their sched
ule has otherwise been very chal
lenging. The Waves lost 4-3 at
home at the hands of Fresno State
and 6-1 at No. 16 UCLA.
Last year, the Cardinal defeat
ed Pepperdine 6-1.
Stanford expects two well
played matches this weekend.
"Pacific's a pretty strong
team," sophomore Lizzy Ben
nett said. "Pepperdine's a
stronger team, though, so it's
nice to have a match before that
to get geared up."
The Fresno State match will be
made up at the team indoors in
Madison, Wise., Feb. 7-10 if the
two teams should meet in that
tournament. Otherwise, the two
schools will try to reschedule the
match fora later date.
"We're hoping to meet them in
Wisconsin," Bennett said. "We're
looking forward to that."
Pacific's top singles player, Su
sanne Bertel, is ranked 103 rd na
tionally and is the only ranked
singles player the Cardinal will
face this weekend. Neither the
Tigers nor the Waves have any
ranked doubles tandems.
Stanford, conversely, boasts
