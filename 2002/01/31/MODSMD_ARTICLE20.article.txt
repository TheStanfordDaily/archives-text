and No. 18 Denver (2-1) on Sun
day at home.
After last week's victory over
Arizona State, who have only lost

five times at home in the past
decade, Stanford will come into
this weekend's liomestand with a
particularly positive outlook.
"Defeating Arizona at their
home was a huge, huge feat," said
head coach Kristen Smyth. "It was
an outstanding accomplishment
because this is the first time Stan
ford has won there. The seniors,
especially, stepped up and stayed
focused under pressure."
This focus will Ik- especially im
portant for Stanford this year, as

the Cardinal has high hopes of
maintaining the prestige of last
year's team. Defeating top teams
like Arizona State will start them
down the right path.
Stanford, however, can't dwell
on this victory too long; its sched
ule is filled with tough matchups
against teams su< h as UCLA, IVnn
Slate and Oregon State. 1 his is
demonstrated this weekend, as the
team faces two top-ranked teams.
