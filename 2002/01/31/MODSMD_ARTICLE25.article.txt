TRACK AND FIELD
Saturday: Stanford at the
Air force Quadrangular, all
day, Colorado Springs, Co.

and Field (lhallenge.
Arizona and Colorado will join
the Cardinal at the meet, to he
hosted l>\ the Ail Font 1 Falcons
this Saturda\ in Colorado
Springs.
(liven that onl\ loin teams will
he competing, the meet will he
stored as a quadrangular, mean
in if that onl\ two athletes from

each team ma\ store points m
each event.
Colorado State won the (chal
lenge lasl year on both the men's
and women's sides but will be met
bv strong competition from a
small vet powerful Held.
Stanford's women finished
eighth in last year's outdoor
championships, while Arizona

took fifth in the indoor (liampi
onshipsand fourth outdoors.
Ihe Air Fold 's Cadet Field
I louse sils at approximately 7,000
feet above sea level, making it a
ver\ difficult venue for distance
runners who have virtually no
time to acclimate to the altitude.
Senior Daniel Harris, who
competed in the NCAA Cross
Country Championships this fall,
and junior Adam lenforde will
compete in the distance events,
but most runners who participat
ed last weekend in the lerrier
(.lassi< w ill stav home and contin
ue their training.
While it nia\ leave distance
runners gasping lor breath, the
altitude effect aids sprinters,
jumpers and throwers, w ho have
less air resistant e to contend with
and will be aiming for personal-

record marks.
No team will be at its full
strength at the (lhallenge, so any
attempts to predict NCAA Cham
pionship finishes based on these

earlx meets would be futile.
I he st.ikes .it t his meet are nev -
ertheless high, .is each athlete
aims lot an NCAA automatic
qualih ing mark.
