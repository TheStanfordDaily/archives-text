# 'Home' stretch awaits Cardinal
## 
### AARON LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's obvious that the Cardinal
has had a split personality so lar
this season.
The bigger mystery, though, is
why — why has the team been shaky
at times and assertive at others?
How about this: Their play is
simply a reflection of the diverse
natures of the players.
Nothing could have demon
strated that point better than their
answers to one simple question
earlier this week: "I low important
are the next eight games, consid
ering six of them are at home?"

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Tonight: No. 15 Stanford vs
Arizona State, 7:30 p.m.,
Maples Pavilion.
Saturday: No. 15 Stanford
vs. Arizona, 5 p.m., Maples
Pavilion.

Josh Childress, the eager fresh
man, replied first.
" This is probably the major
stretch right here. 1 'his could make
or break our championship run."
Casey Jacobsen, the elder
statesman, disagreed.
"No matter what happens, the

year is determined by how well you
do in the [NCAA] tournament.
1 he tournament is the key to the
whole puzzle."
Same question, opposite
answers.
()n one hand, there's Jacobsen's
poise. I lis patience. I lis eye on the
ultimate prize.
At the same time, there's Chil
dress' anxiousness. His urgency.
I lis sense of'Now'.
Jacobsen in a nut-shell? "We've
got time."
Childress? "Let's get it on."
The dichotomy represents the
reason that the entire Stanford
team can be so fun, and frustrating,
to watch this season. All of the Car
dinars players have different dis
positions, distinct lines of thinking
and a unique court presence. Put
them together and one is left with
an intriguing blend of youth and
experience, dedication and cama
raderie, that is just waiting to gel.
In the past, as far as character,
motivation and leadership were
concerned, Stanford was one-di
mensional. Stable, but one-dimen
sional. I Ilis year, the roles are
more spread out and the ideas are
more free-flowing, creating a
plethora of possibility.
So although it's not all blissful in
t he kingdom of Cardinal, the po
tential is certainly there.
And despite Jacobsen's con
tention that the stakes are the
greatest in March, he and the en
tire Clardinal team still understand
the present task at hand.
Tonight, it's Arizona State. Sat
inday, it's No. 19 Arizona.
"You've got to protect your
home court in conference. You've
got to take care of business at
home," senior point guard Tony
(Jiovacc hini said.
Safe to say that to be at Maples
Pavilion for four games — two
against the Arizona schools and
two against the ()regon schools —
is a bit of a relief to the players.
I hey know how tough the road
can be, and too of ten they have ex
perienced close games and silent
bus rides home.
However, the next two week
ends represent a new beginning.
It's a stretch that could jump-start
the No. IS Cardinal (12-5, 5-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference) and give it a
bona fide opportunity to reach the

top of the conference standings.
"It's nice for us to have four
games here with an opportunity to
keep defending our home court,
and we're capable of winning all
four of them," Ciovacchini said.
"But any one of them can get away
fioin us and each one presents a
different challenge."
The first challenge is Arizona
State (11-7,4-5), a team that has al
ready beaten Arizona and Oregon
and one that Jacobsen called the
most underrated team in the Pac
-10 conference.
Sun Devils coach Rob Evans is
"very intense and his players are
very intense and they are going to
get after you,'' said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "They're not
going to give you any lay tips and
not going to give you anything for
free. They're going to dive on the
floor for loose balls.
" They'll pick you up for 94 feet
for 40 minutes," he said.
It's the "94 feet" that's the prob
lem. A full-court press wreaked
havoc for the Cardinal last week
against Southern California, a
game in which Stanford committed
27 turnovers in a 90-82 loss. Ac
cording to Montgomery, Arizona
State's full-court press is more man
to-man, rather than zone, which
will probably be easier to break.
"You can just wave everybody
down the court and bring the ball
up against that player," junior
guard Julius Barnes said.
Senior center Chad Prewitt
leads the Sun Devils, averaging
17.7 points and 0.6 rebounds per
game. I le is surrounded by two
proficient guards, Curtis Millage
and Kenny ('randall, who both av
erage double-digits as well.
Arizona (13-6, 6-3), which the
(Cardinal hosts at 5:00 p.m. on Sat
urday, has defeated the Cardinal
three out of the last four meetings
at Maples Pavilion. All five starting
Wildcats are averaging over 10
points a game, and while senior
point Jason Gardner is the Wild
cats' biggest scoring threat (21.3
ppg), Montgomery said that junior
guard Luke Walton is their most
valuable player.
"1 le's their glue, he keeps them
all together," Montgomery said.
"He's got great c ourt presence. I le
just knows where everybody is and
makes everyone better."

Josh Childress, shown driving the lane against Washington, thinks that the
next few games will make or break the Cardinal's season, while Casey Ja
cobsen thinks the NCAA tournament is the key.
