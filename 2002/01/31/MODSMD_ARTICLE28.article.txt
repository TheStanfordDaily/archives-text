Okay, the loss to USC last Sat
urday was a big deal.
A win at the L.A. Sports Arena
would have put Stanford right
hack at the top of the Pacific 10
Conference ladder.
Hut, unfortunately, that just
didn't happen.
What could Ik* a bigger deal
than the loss to the Trojans?
How about the permanent loss
of junior center C antis Borchardt?
Fortunately, Cardinal fans only
got to see a brief glimpse of what
life would be like without Curtis.
Borchardt's hip pointer hasn't
sidelined him permanently (Curtis
is set to play in tonight's game
against Arizona State).
Looking on the bright side,
though, the loss of Borchardt in
the game against I S( 1 might serve
as a point of awakening for the rest
of the Stanford big men, specifical
ly sophomores Justin Davis, l eyo
Johnson, Joe Kirchofer and fresh
man Rob I .ittle.
And if anyone's up to the chal
lenge of filling in for Borchardt, it's
these Stanford big men.
When the team went bun gee
jumping during its tour of Australia
last summer, every one of the Car
dinal's forwards and centers took
the plunge. Only two guards,

sophomore Matt Lotti< hand senior
Tony Ciovacchini, joined them.
"Kveryone else wimped out,"
Kirchofer said.
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery probably won't let
them take any more risks like that
for awhile. With Borchardt's un

certain status, he'll need every
healthy body he can get.
Borchardt's unreliable body is
no longer an issue of the past, the
aura of invulnerability that sur
rounds his All-American-type sea
son has been shattered.
Ltst Saturday's game against

USC. reminded fans of years past
when injuries to Borchardt were
simply expected.
I his year, however, Stanford
has a host of big men on reserve,
just in case Borchardt's injury
