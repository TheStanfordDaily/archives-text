### JACOB SAPERSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal center Cori Enghusen
refuses to give up.
After a disappointing first half of
the season, Enghusen lost her start
ing position and saw her minutes
decrease — along with perhaps
her confidence.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Yesterday:
No. 3 Stanford 79, Cal 52

But after a trip back to her home
state of Washington, where she
scored 24 points against the 11 nskies
in front of friends and family, the (i
-foot-7 center has begun to re-estab
lish herself as a presence in the paint
as the No. 3 C Cardinal prepares fora
run into March.
In last night's 79-52 victory
against California, Enghusen con
tinued her string of impressive
showings, finishing the game with a
team-high 15 points to go with
eight rebounds and two blocks in
only 18 minutes of play.
"I feel more confident," said En
ghusen. "I'm fixused on running
the floor and the Washington games
helped l>oost tin confidence. Some
times I get overanxious."
Enghusen came off the bench
with Stanford leading 13-10 antl
12:29 remaining in the first half,
then instantly made her presence
felt with a layupoffof a PNaeThiel
entry pass. I he Cardinal (21-1, 11-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) proceeded
to embark on a 14-5 run with En
ghusen in the game, as the team
took a double-digit lead that it
would never relinquish.
"I was realh excited with how
well Cori played," said head coach
lata VanDerveer. "She ran the
floor really well, got in deep, and
scored really well for us."
On the defensive end, I n
ghusen's play in the paint estab
lished the Cardinal's interior de
fense throughout the game, hold
ing the Bears' leading scorer, cen
ter Ami Forney, to six points on 2-
of-8 shooting. Without inside
scoring, California (0-1 E 1-10)

was unable to create open looks
for its outside shooters, who con
tributed bad shots and saddled
the Bears with a 33.9 shooting
percentage from the field.
"Cori really changes things,"
VanDerveer said. "As many shots as
she blocks [in the paint], she
changes."
Enghusen was helped in the
paint by strong play from senior
Bethany Donaphin and freshmen
Thiel and Azella Ferryman, who
combined for IS points and 15 re
bounds. for the game, the Cardinal
out-rebounded the Bears, 52 to 31.
"We keyed on rebounding,"
VanDerveer said. "We rebounded
really well, and we did a really good
job on the offensive boards."

No. 3 Stanford 79, Cal 52

But after a trip back to her home
state of Washington, where she
scored 24 points against the 11 nskies
in front of friends and family, the (i
-foot-7 center has begun to re-estab
lish herself as a presence in the paint
as the No. 3 C Cardinal prepares fora
run into March.
In last night's 79-52 victory
against California, Enghusen con
tinued her string of impressive
showings, finishing the game with a
team-high 15 points to go with
eight rebounds and two blocks in
only 18 minutes of play.
"I feel more confident," said En
ghusen. "I'm fixused on running
the floor and the Washington games
helped l>oost tin confidence. Some
times I get overanxious."
Enghusen came off the bench
with Stanford leading 13-10 antl
12:29 remaining in the first half,
then instantly made her presence
felt with a layupoffof a PNaeThiel
entry pass. I he Cardinal (21-1, 11-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) proceeded
to embark on a 14-5 run with En
ghusen in the game, as the team
took a double-digit lead that it
would never relinquish.
"I was realh excited with how
well Cori played," said head coach
lata VanDerveer. "She ran the
floor really well, got in deep, and
scored really well for us."
On the defensive end, I n
ghusen's play in the paint estab
lished the Cardinal's interior de
fense throughout the game, hold
ing the Bears' leading scorer, cen
ter Ami Forney, to six points on 2-

scoring, California (0-1 E 1-10)

was unable to create open looks
