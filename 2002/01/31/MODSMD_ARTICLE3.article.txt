"We're ver\ pleased," said Jane Camaril
lo, directoi ol Residential Kducation. "The
two organizations submitted verv strong
j)roj)osals |for housing] and demonstrated
commitment not onlv to being a strong
(ireek organization but alsoa strong campus
organization."
Res Kd officials said Phi Psi was awarded
housing because it It.is a thorough record of
working with comnumit\ senile programs
and non-Cireek oi ganizations. Plans for resi
dential programs* ind the presence of an ac
tive alumni group also helped secure Phi
Psi's housing.
Sigma Nil's strong community involve
ment both on- and oil-campus, its ability to
meet occupano requirements and its de
tailed budget were partii iilarK strong lea
lures of its housing proposal, officials noted.
I lie Sigma Phi Kpsilon Iraternitx also sub
mitted a proposal to receive housing, but was
denied.
"Sig Kj) was indeed a strong proposal ad
dressing all the criteria but, according to the
Review Board, did not seem focused as com
pared to the detail and integration of the

other two organiz.alions,'' (iamarillo said, "li
was difficult lor the Board to get a sense of
their specific direction as it related to roles of
stall and leadership, integration ola strong
Residential Kducation program and transla
tion ol the national model lo the Stanford
(ireek c< mtext."
Members of the soon-to-be-housed frater
nities said they lelt the change will enable
their organizations to give more to the Stan
lord community.
"Oncol the reasons we decided to apph
was that we had reai bed a point in our chap
ter development where [housing] could make
our chapter stronger, said junior Nccraj

Chandra, a Sigma Nu. "That would allow lis
to get more involved with comniunit\ service
and contribute lo the Stanford eommunit)
better."
According to Nanci I lowe, assistant dean
,ind director ol Student Activities and co
chair of the (ireek. Housing Review board,
the fraternities' entry into 111<* Row houses is
being staggered in order to facilitate an easi
er transition.
"We wanted to house onlv one new chap
ter a vcar because we want to show that the
I niversit\ stall'is committed Lo working with
the organizations to make sure the transition
is a smooth one." I lowe said.

Manx students and staff involved with the
(ireek housing process said tliev were satis
lied with the dec isions to award housing to
the two fraternities.
" I his board was inc redibh thorough in its
anahsis and exceeding!) patient," said se
nior |oc elvn I .oltus-W illiams, co-chair of the
Review Board.
| unioi Sai a Warn pier, a resident assistant
representative on the Board, said, "I'm sure

1 lie housing awards raise a
host of controversial issues for
both the Greek and non-Greek
student populations.
According to Camarillo, yester
day's decisions bring the number
ol Row houses assigned to Greek
organizations to thecapac it) desig
nated by the board.
"Since we've reached the capaci
ty, which is 25 percent ol the Row
houses, we won't be reviewing any
more proposals for housing," she
said. "That allows (he Board to ex
amine more closely how well the
housed organizations are meeting
the criteria |for retaining housing]."
In addition, because the May
field Row houses are considered
by many to be premium resi
dences, the removal of those
houses from the Draw frustrates
many students. *
"They are taking potential liv
ing spaces from other people,"
said sophomore J a red Van (Heave.
Asst. Director for Student Man

agement Augie Galvan acknowl
edged such sentiments and said the
housing dec ision "puts a lot of re
sponsibility on the part of student
officers to meet concerns from the
general student population."
"Sometimes it's easier for us in
the administration [to make hous
ing decisions], but the reality is
that we will be working with the
staff in each house to answer ques
tions and concerns from stu
dents," he said. "We want to make
sure this transition is good for
both |the (Ireek organizations and
the non-(.reek student body].
Main students also may ques
tion the selection of these particu
lar Row houses for assignment to
the fraternities. According to Res
Kd officials, the pool of housing
available for proposal purposes
was determined last year.
On a recommendation by the
Row I ask Force, 553 May field,
557 Mayfield and 592 Mayfield
were chosen based on eac li house's
number of singles and doubles,
proximity to other Greek houses
and disability access.
" The choice of the houses in the
pool was driven, at least in part-, by

the houses that were least appeal
ing to seniors," 11 owe said. "More
than half of the students in those
houses will he in one-room dou
bles or triples."
Camarillo stressed that while
the Row houses will no longer be
open to the general student body,
fraternity members moving into
the Row houses will also free
spates in other desirable upper
class residencies.
Res Kd Assoc. Director John
|nclicki also addressed potential
concerns from the students cur
rently living in 592 and ~>f>7
Mayfield.
"We want to be sensitive to the
needs of the residents," he said.
"Phi Psi will be working with the
Row Office. We'll be working with
Sigma Nu, giving them training
and mentoringexperiences,sothey
can successfully assume a house."
Despite the challenges, officials
expressed confidence that the se
lected fraternities have a promising
future as housed organizations.
"While we're poised to work
with them, I have no doubt they're
ready," I lowe said. "They're more
than ready."
