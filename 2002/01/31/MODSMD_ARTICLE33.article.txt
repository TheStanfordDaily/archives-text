Could No. 24 Wake Forest possibly
collapse in the second halt ol the season
two years in a row?
Josh Howard and Darius Songaila
put an end to such thoughts alter a
clutch 82-81 win over red-hot North
('.arolina State last night.
I lie Demon Deac oils started 12-0 last
year before a 7-1 1 finish wast apped In
an embarrassing first round NCAA
tournament loss to Butler.
Dave Odom left lor South Carolina
and the Demon Deacons hired Skip
I'rosser, who had his new team oil to a
IM-H start .iiid No. 14 ranking before
three ol lour losses had some wondering
il Wake Forest was ready to tank again.
"Alter we lost three in a row we were
thinking about it,"said Songaila, who
s( orcd 18 ol his 20 points in the second
half. "Fverybod\ stepped up and said,
'I ley, this isn't going to happen.'
"Il all started with the coaches. I'hev
told us they weren't going to let us go
downhill like hist year. Il rubbed oil On
the players. Kven though we had some
tough losses against some tough teams,
everybody stayed lot used.
Howard put togethei his second

straight stellar game. 1 le mate heel a sea
son-high with 21 points and had nine re
bounds and live assists. I hat came on
the heels of a 20-point, nine-rebound,

(">, tied them with the Wolfpack for
third place in the Atlantic ( oast (onler
enc e behind co-leaders I)uke and Mary

way mark in the A('.(l in live seasons.
"We're motivated not to let what
happened to us last year happen
again," Howard said. " I hat was a big
downer lor us. FverybocK is saying,
'No, not this year.' "
I loward's game-winning free throws
with 9.1 seconds left capped oil a great
night at the foul line for the I)cmon Dea
cons. who were 24-of-28.
"Ilyou've never experienced that, it's
unbelievable,'" 1 loward said of his trip to
the line in front of hunch e els ol waving
Wolfpack students. "You can see arms
waving, people are calling mv name that
don't even know me. It's an experience,
but \oii have to step up and see past all
of that."
Anthoin Crunch scored 24 points
and Miller matched his career-high with
22, but il wasn't enough as Wake Forest

shot better than 50 percent in an ACC
game for the first time this season, hit
ling lor percent against one of the top
defensive clubs.
N.(State last led at 59-57 with 12:31
left before Wake Forest went on a 19-4
run to go up by 13.
Songaila had six points in the run and
Howard had five. But three turnovers
on consecutive possessions helped the
Wolfpack close late and leave an impres
sion on Prosser, whose club moved to 6-
0 in games decided by six points or less.
"1 lerb (Setidek) has ;i team of true be
lievers who are really playing with pas
sion," Prosser said. "It's somewhat dif
ferent than the team I saw on tape play
Wake last year. I lis kids are very good."
