# Trio of talented contributors form a
## Senior Act 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
It lias been a season of redemption in many respects.
After various setbacks in previous vears for the Stanford
women's basketball squad, the (urrent senior ( lass began
the season with some specific and ambitious goals in

mind — goals the group is well on it > wa\ to achieving,
lite No. 3-ranked team in thecountn is led, in

part, by its senior post players. Betham Donaphin,
Cori Knghusenand Knjoli I/idor might have dif
ferent styles, different strengths and different

experiences, but eac li one gets the job done on
the court.
l he three have started a combined ,'U) times
this season, in positions ranging from off
guard, to forward, to center. Kach has been an

instrumental part of the team, stepping up
when needed and ensuring wins with big
games.
Donaphin began the season as a reserve,
but her dedication and tough offensive
moves in preseason play earned her a spot
in the starting lineup by the time the ((in
ference games began.
Both offensiveh and defensively.
Donaphin explodes into action — re
bounding, blocking, posting in the paint

and filling the lanes in transit ion. 1 hefi-fbot
-2 senior is ranked second in the I'acilk 10
Conference in field-goal percentage ;it .524
and has 111 career blocked shots, third in
Stanford history.
"I'm not the biggest post player in the world.

but 1 use my quickness to get around bigger post
players, or maybe jump over them," Donaphin
said. "I think I help get people pumped up. My fa
vorite thing to do is block a shot and stare the oppo-

nent down, and I think my teammates get hyped up
off that."
Donaphin's pre-basketball t raining would surprise
most people. I ler footwork, which she credits as one of

her strengths, comes from years of dancing experience.
From Broadway's (Cinderella ;it age nine to the ()peningand
Closing Ceremonies of the 1996 Summer Olympus, Donaphin
honed her striking on-court poise with years at the ballet ban e.

"Dancing for 13 years has had a huge effect on my basketball career,"
Donaphin said. "I feel realh comfortable being the size that I am. It lias given me
strength and agility."
While Knghusen brings a bit of a different background to her game, t he* result s are

just as effective.
Enghusen leads the team in blocks this year and has recently come oil
a huge road trip to the Washington schools in which she averaged

18.5 points in two g;mies. I he Bothell native's play in her home
state lifted her game to a new level — just in time to prepare to
finish out conference play.

"Hopefully that will build confidence not only in
myself, but in the coaching stall," said Enghusen. "1
hope to give [the team) a low-posi presence, like 1 did
in Washington."

Along with fellow senior and teammate
Lindsey Yamasaki, Enghusen toured overseas
this past summer with the World University
(iames, where she helped the U.S. bring home
a gold medal. I lie experience helped En
ghusen s confidence while exemplifying her
determination to succeed.

While Enghusen's mere presence is intim
idating in its own right, her moves in transi
tion and her skill down low make her a force
to be reckoned with by the defense and a
crowd favorite at home.
l/.idor adds yet another style into the mix
when she steps on the court, as she boasts
an amazingly versatile court persona. l)e-

pending on what her team needs from
her, Izidor can play it calm or play it fast,
hut she always plays it smart. She can enter
ilie game as both a guard and forward,
helping to mix up both the offensive and
defensive routines and often sparking her
team's play.
While Izidor averages only 4.4 points per

game, those points have always come at big mo
ments, giving her team the boost it needs to pull
away or make a run on its opponents.
"I think I help keep the energy up and make sure
everyone is on the same page," said I/idor. "Our ex-

perience |«is seniors] has people look to us to be the
ones to ( all people together, to pump people up and to
get things going whenever we're in a bit of a slump."

It's ,i (all order for these posts to fill — prolific of
fense, dogging defense and leadership — but they have been
up to the challenge so far this season.
Its ;ils(> ;i heavy load these women help shoulder — the (Car-

dinal is looking fora Pac-10 Championship, a trip to the Final Four in
San Antonio and the program's third national championship banner.

"It has all happened reall\ fast, but it's our senior season and 1 keep getting nostalgic
and looking back," said I/idor. "We're just trying to keep the momentum going all the
way to the Final Four."

It lias been a season of redemption in many respects.
After various setbacks in previous vears for the Stanford
women's basketball squad, the (urrent senior ( lass began
the season with some specific and ambitious goals in

mind — goals the group is well on it > wa\ to achieving,
lite No. 3-ranked team in thecountn is led, in

part, by its senior post players. Betham Donaphin,
Cori Knghusenand Knjoli I/idor might have dif
ferent styles, different strengths and different

experiences, but eac li one gets the job done on
the court.
l he three have started a combined ,'U) times
this season, in positions ranging from off
guard, to forward, to center. Kach has been an

instrumental part of the team, stepping up
when needed and ensuring wins with big
games.
Donaphin began the season as a reserve,
but her dedication and tough offensive
moves in preseason play earned her a spot
in the starting lineup by the time the ((in
ference games began.
Both offensiveh and defensively.
Donaphin explodes into action — re
bounding, blocking, posting in the paint

and filling the lanes in transit ion. 1 hefi-fbot
-2 senior is ranked second in the I'acilk 10
Conference in field-goal percentage ;it .524
and has 111 career blocked shots, third in
Stanford history.
"I'm not the biggest post player in the world.

but 1 use my quickness to get around bigger post
players, or maybe jump over them," Donaphin
said. "I think I help get people pumped up. My fa
vorite thing to do is block a shot and stare the oppo-

nent down, and I think my teammates get hyped up
off that."
