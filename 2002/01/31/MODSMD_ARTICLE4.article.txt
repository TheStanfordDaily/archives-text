The Greek Housing Re
view Board's decision yester
dav to award the 557 and 592
May field Row houses to the
Sigma Nu and Phi Kappa Psi
fraternities, respectively, has
sparked student debate on
the move's effect on the Stan
ford community as a whole.
Representatives from the
two soon-to-be housed frater
nities said they were very
pleased with the results.
Senior (lhris Montgomery,
president of Phi Psi, ex
pressed excitement about the
prospect of his group moving
into 592 Mavfield next year.
"We are absolutely
thrilled," he said. "We see this
as an opportunity to be a focal
point in our organization."
Montgomery said having a
house will help Phi Psi achieve
more continuity in their
events and help bring alumni
back to campus.
Sigma Nu President Sudha
Sathiaseelan, also a senior, ex
pressed similar sentiments re-
garding his fraternity's move,
which will occur in 2003-04.
"Personally, I'm extremely
happy lor the fraternity as a whole,
despite the fact that I won't get to
live in |the new house]," Sathiasee
lan said.
"I think it will be a great place
to come hack to in future years,
and it will only help Sigma Nu
grow as a fraternity on campus,"
he continued. "I'm relieved that
the hard work of the guys paid oil
in the end."
Senior Adam Marchick, Sigma
Nil's chaplain, spoke of the gener
al feeling among his fraternity

brothers.
" They're really excited, and
they also think it's the perfect situ
ation," said Marchick, who spear
headed the fraternity's application
process." I his is not only a great lo
cation, but we're also going to have
a year to prepare for having a
house . . . We're going to hit the
ground running."
A number of students who arc
not members of fraternities or
sororities expressed dissatisfac
tion with the Cireek Review
Board's dec ision, c iting the exist
ing housing crunch and the fur
ther reduction in premium spots
on the Row that will be open to
non-Cireek students.
"I disagree with the (ireek
Housing committee's derision to
grant housing to Sigma Nu and

Phi Psi," said junior' Joel I lartman.
"Why can't we just take .ill tlu* I'rats
.uhl put them together in ('.echo?
"Next year, as a senior, I'll be
that much more likely to live in
Wilbur now ili.ii one ol the Row
houses will be taken away." Mail
man added.
Sophomore Christian Ander
son said he recognized pros and
cons in flu- situation.
"I think it's good that the I'rats
can be more integrated with the
Stanford community instead ol
being integrated into their own
little pockets," he said. "On the
other hand, I think it's a shame
that 557 is being taken oil the
market. It was one of the nicest
houses."
Members of both fraternities
did acknowledge that the hous

ing decision — while positive
from their points ol view — will
not be well-received In many
non-(.reck students.
"We're all extremely happy
with the committee's deci
sion . . . |but] we expect that there
will be some student backlash,"
said junior Neeraj Chandra, a
member ol Sigma Nu, said.
"As an unhoused community,
we «an einpallii/e with llic space
crunch, and it's something we'll
continue to think about in the
\cars to (ome," he added.
Phi Psi leaders are also aware
ol the potcniiallv negative cllect
the decision could have on the
house itself.
"We sympathize with the cur
rent residents and stalfol .VJ2 Mav
lield — we too would feel hurt 111 a

similar situation," Montgomery
said in a statement. "However,
we're confident that we can work
with the residents to preserve llie
traditions and activities of the

unique culture to the Row."

The Greek Housing Re
view Board's decision yester
dav to award the 557 and 592
May field Row houses to the
Sigma Nu and Phi Kappa Psi
fraternities, respectively, has
sparked student debate on
the move's effect on the Stan
ford community as a whole.
Representatives from the
two soon-to-be housed frater
nities said they were very
pleased with the results.
Senior (lhris Montgomery,
president of Phi Psi, ex
pressed excitement about the
prospect of his group moving
into 592 Mavfield next year.
"We are absolutely
thrilled," he said. "We see this
as an opportunity to be a focal
point in our organization."
Montgomery said having a
house will help Phi Psi achieve
more continuity in their
events and help bring alumni
back to campus.
Sigma Nu President Sudha
Sathiaseelan, also a senior, ex
pressed similar sentiments re-
garding his fraternity's move,
which will occur in 2003-04.
"Personally, I'm extremely
happy lor the fraternity as a whole,
despite the fact that I won't get to
live in |the new house]," Sathiasee
lan said.
"I think it will be a great place
to come hack to in future years,
and it will only help Sigma Nu
grow as a fraternity on campus,"
he continued. "I'm relieved that
the hard work of the guys paid oil
in the end."
Senior Adam Marchick, Sigma
Nil's chaplain, spoke of the gener
al feeling among his fraternity

brothers.
" They're really excited, and
they also think it's the perfect situ
ation," said Marchick, who spear
headed the fraternity's application
process." I his is not only a great lo
cation, but we're also going to have
a year to prepare for having a
house . . . We're going to hit the
ground running."
A number of students who arc
not members of fraternities or
sororities expressed dissatisfac
tion with the Cireek Review
Board's dec ision, c iting the exist
ing housing crunch and the fur
ther reduction in premium spots
on the Row that will be open to
non-Cireek students.
"I disagree with the (ireek
Housing committee's derision to
grant housing to Sigma Nu and

Phi Psi," said junior' Joel I lartman.
"Why can't we just take .ill tlu* I'rats
.uhl put them together in ('.echo?
"Next year, as a senior, I'll be
that much more likely to live in
Wilbur now ili.ii one ol the Row
houses will be taken away." Mail
man added.
Sophomore Christian Ander
son said he recognized pros and
cons in flu- situation.
"I think it's good that the I'rats
can be more integrated with the
Stanford community instead ol
being integrated into their own
little pockets," he said. "On the
other hand, I think it's a shame
that 557 is being taken oil the
market. It was one of the nicest
houses."
