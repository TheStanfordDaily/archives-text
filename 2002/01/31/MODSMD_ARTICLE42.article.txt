# Hefner gets much less ass than Hugh

### JONATHAN BEARD 
Much of the Hefner's new album
"Dead Media" was recorded in a garage,
notes lead singer / keyboardist / song
writer Darren Hayman on the band's

Web site. T his makes fora gritty, inti
mate and rough sound that contrasts
with the biggest change from their
previous records — the extensive use
of old analog synthesizers.
Additionally, Hayman notes that
Hefner will be using more and more
synthesizers on the band's next
album, so fans, he says, should get
used to it. I his may be a tough pill for
Hefner fans to swallow, but if the
synths are going to stay, the question
is, "Do they work?"
Consider "Dead Media" a first try in
a new sound. Ultimately, the album is
somewhat uneven, with bright mo
ments interspersed throughout. The
first three tracks characterize the

album well.
Track one, the title track, is an odd
synthetic nugget of analog electronics
that starts the record off with a slight mis
step. Hefner hits its stride with tlu- rock
ing / sampling "Trouble Kid," the

album's best song, followed by the beau
tifully haunting ballad "Junk." The lat
ter, like many songs on the record, ex
ploits a successful combination of synths
and slide guitar, as well as a retro sound
ing horn section.
"Dead Media" is full of the cynical and
ironic lyrics that Hefner fans are used
to. Hayman's lyrics are his biggest
strength. How can you help but be in
trigued by a man who asks a girl to "let
me let you let me down again?" (She
I said no). Or "Shut up / Wake up /1 can
I smell the coffee; why can't you?"
I In "Waking Up to You," Hayman 10-
! mances his girl with the following
words: "And since we gave up drugs
i and started drinking, 1 feel new / I
\ think I learned to love because of you."
j Yeah, this guy's got an interesting wa\
[ of putting things.
Unfortunately, "Dead Media" is a little
I top heavy with the brooding abuse of
synthesizers, like in the title track. The

songs where Hefner sounds like they're
actually having a good time — "Trouble
Kid" and"The King of Summer" — are
preciously few. The new electronic
sound works best in many of the fine bal
lads, where the nature of the music
makes it much less tempting for 1 layman
to overdo it.
"Dead Media" is both an enjoyable lis
ten and a frustrating one, because it hints
at the band's potential. Hefner's next
album will probably offer a better sense
of the band's musical direction. If, like
on the best songs of "Dead Media," Hav
man uses his antique electronics to com
plement and not dominate the music, we
may someday hear something very spe
cial indeed.
