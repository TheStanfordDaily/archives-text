Anyone familiar with |onah Ma
tranga's former band Far and his
solo project onelinedrawing already
knows about the tight songwriting
craft and lyrical depth he brings to
his various musical projects. Matran
ga's new rock band, New End Origi
nal, is no exception.
The group is made up of Matran
ga on guitar and lead vocals, drum
mer Charlie Walker from the band
Split Lip, and guitarist / pianist Nor
man Arenas and bassist Scott Wine
gard, both formerly emo champs
from the influential mid-'9os band
Texas Is The Reason.
A collaboration that was in the
works for years, New End Original
has finally released their first lull
length album, the decidedly un-
Michael Jackson-like "Thriller,"
which clearly shows the influences of
the band members' previous work
by melding together emo, punk,
hardcore and indie rock. The result
is 11 tracks that effortlessly blend
different musical styles into sharply
written songs that are accessible
while remaining intelligent.
Frontman Matranga's songwrit
ing has a lot to do with the record's
success. Me has a writer's eye for
lyrics, and his command of vocal
range is even more impressive and
haunting than his work from the Far
days. His voice, which moves from
haunting, to uppity harmonic, to fu-

riously intense, really showcases a
performance-like quality that he
manages to deliver on a studio
album. Coupled with the solid musi
cianship of his bandmates and a low
key, clean sound — courtesy of pro
ducer Brian McTernan (Texas Is the
Reason) — "Thriller" crosses genres
naturally, thereby generating a
broad appeal through its stylistically
varied songs.
The first track off the album,
"Lukewarm," is also one of its best.
Originally released as a single in the
summer of 2001, it uses a driving
mid-tempo drum beat and perfectly
harmonized vocals to get across its
inspirational call for personal better
ment. "A house in the burbs and a
bitchin' SUV is how I'm never gonna
wind up," Matranga tells us, imme
diately alienating himself from
about half of the Stanford under
grad population right off the bat.
The song's chorus becomes even
more confessional — "I never
wanna say my best days are behind
me" — a statement at once opti
mistic and depressing, and emphati-

cally true for just about
everybody.
The next song is a
new version of a one
linedrawing song, "14-
41*" which, like "Luke
warm," also deals with
the pressures of grow
ing older. As compared
to its Jonah-solo coun
terpart, New End Orig
inal's take on the song
is significantly more
complete with its two
guitar melodic anchor
and Matranga's vocal
build-up that shifts
from mellow to raging.

These first two songs are the only
pure pop songs on the album, whose
mood quickly shifts to piano-backed
melancholy acoustic ballad ("Leper
Song"), wistful emo-style love song
("#1 Defender") and soaring indie
rock goodness ("Titanic"). "Weary
Progress" begins with Matranga's al
most-whisper and then showcases
the band's harder edged distortion
guitar-work, while the album's clos
ing track, "Better Than This," is an
other reworked onelinedrawing
song that offers tip an eight-minute
existential self-examination via raw
vocal honesty and scaled-back in
strumentation.
The sheer range of style and tal
ent displayed on this debut album is
fulfilling enough as it is. But when
you multiply into the equation the
quality of each of the band members'
previous musical endeavors, you are
left with an end product of dynamic,
awesome material you want to tell
your friends about. Check out Jonah
Matranga's solo project oneline
