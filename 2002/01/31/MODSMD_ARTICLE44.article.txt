In the first act of "Monster's Ball," Sonny
Grotoski (Heath Ledger) has a motel ren
dezvous with the town hooker — they forni
cate standing up, leaning against the radiator
for support, with the same dry courtesy you
might extend to a valet parking your car. Be
fore and after the ritual, director Man Forster
offers us close-ups of them staring coldly intc> a
bathroom mirror, too exhausted with life to

even feel self-loathing.
Across town, in an even more hopeless situ
ation, sits Liwrence Musgrove (Sean Combs),
an inmate on death row for the murder of
three police officers. I le is guarded bytieorgia
prison corrections officer Hank Grotowski
(Billy Bob Thornton), the father of Sonny, the
prison guard.
It is explained to us that before perma
nently checking out of death row, the con
demned prisoner is given a party of sorts
by the prison staff, a party referred to af
fectionately as the monster's ball. For the
accused, this party is not about penitence
and not really about redemption either,
but rather the remembrance of life and
what it means to be human.
Set in the racist outback of Jackson, Geor
gia, "Monster's Ball" follows the unlikely ro
mance that evolves between I lank Grotowski
and Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), the un
stable widow of Lawrence Musgrove, who is
executed a quarter of the way through the

film. Thornton's taciturn performance as a
racist prison guard is masterful, adding to an
already stellar year that included "The Man
Who Wasn't There" and "Bandits." More sur
prising perhaps, is the Oscar-worthy perfor
mance' delivered by Berry — a complex blend
of histrionics, hardened cynicism and childish
innocence.
But if you thought Berry's performance
was unexpected, just wait 'til you get a load of
Sean (lombs — or P. I )iddy, as he likes to call
himself. I lis character possesses a refined sub
tlety you just plain wouldn't expect out of a
gangsta rapper. Musgrove is haunted and
gentle. I Ie imbues every word with quiet, fal
tering remorse, as il his tears had dried up
years ago, expc>singa parched, futile nostalgia.
A review of "Monster's Ball" can't readily
escape analysis ofits unabashed sexual content
— five years ago, this film would have received
the dreaded NC-17 rating with no questions
asked. Foster uses sexuality powerfully, how
ever, deftly contrasting copulation with love-

away, and with it the chance for redemption.
The film, however, offers a genuine second
chance for our protagonists — a chance to re
experience life, and having remembered the
feeling, a chance to rebuild.
Before his execution, Combs' character sits
in his cell, sketching a portrait of Thornton's
guard. "1 think a portrait is better at capturing
the truth than a camera," Combs explains.
"Only a human can really see another
human." If this is true, then "Monster's Ball"
comes as close to bewildering human truth as
celluloid has to offer.


Sorry, her face didn't fit.
