If tugging ai heartstrings is a film direc tor's path to en
lightenment, then |essie Nelson, the dim tor/ producer/co
s( leeinvriter of "I Am Sam," has reached nirvana. The film is
a wrenching tale <>l an autistic, mentally retarded man
deemed incapable of raising his seven-war-old daughter and
the bitter i ustod\ battle that ensues. From the film's the open
ing shots —a dizzying array of Starbucks logos —to the
svrupy-sweet deliverv of the film's intended moral, "All you
need is love, ii is a slit k corporate ci \ -lest that is, at times, well
intentioned, but that lacks strong narrative continuity.
Sean I'enn ("Fast Times at Ridgemont High," "The Thin
Red Line ") carries the film's weight on his shoulders with an
outstandingly convincing portraval of the endearing Sam

Dawson, a loving, Beatles
obsessed Starbucks work
er with the intellectual ca
pacity of a seven-year-old.
When Dawson impreg
nates a homeless woman
who subsequently aban-

<l< »ihim postpartum, he is left alone to care for his newborn
daughter, 1 .ik y Diamond (one of many Beatles allusions in the
film), played l>\ Dakota Fanning.
Despite his disabilities, Dawson raises the girl with a little
help from his friends until a social worker intervenes and
forcibly removes the girl from Dawson's care at her seventh
birthday party.
Enter Rita Harrison (Michelle PfeifFer), a bitchy, obsessive- i
compulsive litigator whose coworkers push her into taking on j
Dawson's case pro bono. As the) work toward the ominous
court date against child protection services. Dawson's pure, |
sincere love tor his daughter teaches Harrison to shed her
hard exterior, and in an emotional breakdown she realizes
that "love is all you need."
While "1 Am Sam" aches for an Oscar nomination with
out much subtlety, its overarching problem lies in its failure L
to deliver. The film's determination to stir up tears over
shadows the film's potential excellence, which could have been
achieved through a more balanced complexity of characteri
zation and a satisfying plot resolution.
Instead, the multitudes of very complicated and real prob
lems that arise in the custody battle are quickly tied up into a

neat package that ends happily enough, but d(x,*s not realisti
cally solve the conflict of whether Dawson can really care for
his child. A series of mishaps leaves the audience unconvinced


Listen bitch, retardation doesn't preclude me from crafting fine lattes
