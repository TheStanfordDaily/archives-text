a wrenching tale <>l an autistic, mentally retarded man

Dawson, a loving, Beatles
obsessed Starbucks work
er with the intellectual ca
pacity of a seven-year-old.
When Dawson impreg
nates a homeless woman
who subsequently aban-

<l< »ihim postpartum, he is left alone to care for his newborn
daughter, 1 .ik y Diamond (one of many Beatles allusions in the
film), played l>\ Dakota Fanning.
Despite his disabilities, Dawson raises the girl with a little
help from his friends until a social worker intervenes and
forcibly removes the girl from Dawson's care at her seventh
birthday party.
Enter Rita Harrison (Michelle PfeifFer), a bitchy, obsessive- i
compulsive litigator whose coworkers push her into taking on j
Dawson's case pro bono. As the) work toward the ominous
court date against child protection services. Dawson's pure, |
sincere love tor his daughter teaches Harrison to shed her
hard exterior, and in an emotional breakdown she realizes
that "love is all you need."
While "1 Am Sam" aches for an Oscar nomination with
out much subtlety, its overarching problem lies in its failure L
to deliver. The film's determination to stir up tears over
shadows the film's potential excellence, which could have been
achieved through a more balanced complexity of characteri
zation and a satisfying plot resolution.
Instead, the multitudes of very complicated and real prob
lems that arise in the custody battle are quickly tied up into a

neat package that ends happily enough, but d(x,*s not realisti
cally solve the conflict of whether Dawson can really care for
his child. A series of mishaps leaves the audience unconvinced


Listen bitch, retardation doesn't preclude me from crafting fine lattes
of Dawson's capacity as a par
ent, and while the viewer des
perately sympathizes with
Penn's devoted character, the
long, drawn-out drama of the
courtrooms and the multitudes
of emotional embraces between
Dawson and his daughter leave
the audience feeling frustrated
and unfulfilled.
Moreover, the develop
ment of the relationship be
tween I'feiffer and Penn's
characters is maudlin and un
convincing, a failed attempt at
a "Rainman" kind of denoue
ment where the thick-skinned
woman is broken down by the
sweet retarded man.
Pfeiffer's sudden emotion
al breakdown and 180-degree
turn in character feels very ar
tificial, and as a result of this,
Pfeiffer and Penn lack sure
ness in their onscreen chem
istry. It is a shame, to be sure,
since Penn is simultaneously
charming and heartbreaking
in each subtle mannerism and
movement.
Witnessing Sean Penn deliv
er a stellar performance that
proves his range as an actor
while backed up by fantastic
Beatles songs makes "I Am
Sam" a pleasurable experience.
However, the film's lack of di
rection as well as its shameless
plugs and blatant appeal to
pathos make it somewhat try
ing to sit through.
