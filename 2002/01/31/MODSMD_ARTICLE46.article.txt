# Aussie thriller no talking dog movie

### RANDY MANO 
Four couples are introduced to
us. Being the savvy mo\ iegoer that
\<>u are, you begin to wonder how
thev can intertwine. Most of the
time you hit it on the bull's-eye; a
few times you miss the dartboard
completely. "Lantana" is one of
those films where, at moments, it
feels like all the players involved
are trying a bit 100 hard to make
things pull together and cause the
audience to go, "oh I see."
Still, this is the sort of produc
tion that, if done well, can really
keep me entertained. At its center,
"Lantana" focuses on Leon (An
thony LaPaglia) and Sonja Zat
(Kerry Armstrong), a couple
whose marriage is on the rocks.
Leon spends his days as a brutal of-

ficer; Sonja, among other
things, visits Dr. Valerie
Somers (Barbara Ilershey)
for psyt hological advice about
Leon's suspected affair.
Soniers, who is married to
John Knox (Geoffrey Rush),
has just written a book about
t hi' death of the Zats' young
girl, much to John's disdain.
John shows his grief to the
world in a very different way —
perhaps, for example, through
privately grieving beside the

stoop where she was killed.
Then there are the two neigh
bors. Nik (Vince Colosimo) and
Paula Daniels (Daniella Farinacti)
have scores of kids around — and
Paula has had to work extra shifts
while Nik takes care of the kids and
"looks" fora job. Next door is Jane

OMay (Rachael Blake), a nosy
neighbor who does noi seem to
mind spying or making passes ai
married men, even though she is
still technically married herself.
Now the table is set. There are
other side players, particularly
Patrick Phelan (Peter Phelps), who

is one of Somers' clients. But
the gist of the set-up is there
— now it's time for you to
start making all the leaps
and assumptions of what
may happen in the Aussie
world of'Lantana."
Director Ray Lawrence, a
relative newcomer and un
known, has gracefully shot
Andrew Bovell's play,
"Speaking in Tongues." The
moody notes of the sound
track, contrasting with the

sensual salsa horns that blare
at times, lend to the air ol mystery
and intrigue that simmers in the
opening half of "Lantana" and
then explodes with a cracker jack fi
nale. I admit that some so-called
"twists" are a bit far-fetched when
played out on the big screen, but

nonetheless this character-driven
film — much like "The Deep Knd
and "In the Bedroom" — pulls yon
in and won't let you go until the
closing credits.
Look for this film, released in <i
few theaters last year and now ex
panding slowly, to open 'in the
coming days around the Bay Area.
There is something left to be de
sired from "Lantana," but it is far
more worthy of your time than the
early-season talking dog and talk
ing young lover stories that are in
filtrating theatres.
