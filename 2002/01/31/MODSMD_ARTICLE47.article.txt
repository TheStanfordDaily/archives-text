Though he is remembered as a charismatic and gift
ed artist, Miguel Pinero was also a tortured man whose
life was rife with contradictions. As a poet in the late

'70s and early '80s,
his 1yricism in
spired the urban
music that we now
know as hip-hop.
His play "Short
Eyes" earned criti
cal acclaim, and

the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in New York City, which he
co-founded with friend Miguel Algarin, continues to
nurture many Latino artists.
As a child of Puerto Rican immigrants, Pinero's
youth was turbulent. He faced sexual abuse and aban
donment by his father, and turned to crime and drugs
.it an early age. Even as he grew older, he was never
able to release himself from the circumstances, situa
tions and habits that molded and informed his person
ality. This is the context for director / screenwriter
Leon Ichaso's film, "Pinero."

Though the
episodes of Pinero's
life are spliced to
gether in a seemingly
haphazard way, the
film's editing empha
sizes that Piriero was a
tremendously com
plex man, even if he
isn't entirely likeable.
Played by Benjamin
Bratt ("Law and

Order," "Miss Congeniality," "Traffic"), Pinero is por
trayed without judgment. Ichaso's reverence for the
man's art is clear, but he understands that Pinero also
had a dark side.
Several scenes shift between "Pinero-as-artist," and
"Piriero-as-junkie" or "Pinero-as-criminal." After he
becomes successful, he gives a neighborhood couple
money so that they can keep their small grocery store
in business. Later, though, he participates in an armed
robbery of a convenience store.
At another point iti the film, Pinero receives an adu
latory introduction at a theater performance of "Short
Eyes," but we see him minutes later putting a needle
through his arm in the bathroom. In his personal life,
he falls in love with a beautiful and talented struggling
actress named Sugar (Talisa Soto), but cannot provide
her with the stability or affection she needs.
In the film, Pinero rationalizes his failings, repeat
ing over and over that in order to keep his art honest,
he needs to continue his antisocial behavior. As his
friend Algarin (played terrifically by Giancarlo Esposi
to) astutely observes, many people could recreate
Pinero's "genius" if they lived as dangerously and irre
sponsibly as he.
lchaso treats other facets of Pinero's life carefully
and somewhat ambiguously. The movie only briefly
hints at his sexuality. While drinking at a strip club,
Pinero comments on a stripper's "beautiful tits" before
gazing at a young male understudy and brushing liis
hand over the man's crotch.
Bratt is at ease in Pinero's skin. His portrayal is su
perb; he mimics the man's internal volatility convinc
ingly, alternating between insanity and tenderness.
After he discovers that lie has cirrhosis, he threatens to
slice a Latino drag queen's stomach and tear out her
liver. Chasing after her, Pinero's eyes gleam and a ma

niacal grin spreads across his face. Later, he appears
genuinely reticent and ashamed when his mother (Kit;i
Moreno) visits him in prison, pleading with him to
shape up and "make her proud."
In the end, "Pinero" emerges as a strange twist on
the classic heroic tragedy. Achieving artistic fame and
celebrity, he remains unapologetic for his flaws. His
multiple personalities incite divisions within us as well.
He is a loathsome character, whose life is nonetheless
admirable.
