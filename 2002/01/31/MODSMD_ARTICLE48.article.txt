# Don't 'Count' on the full 'Monte'
## 
### SANDEEP GOPALAN 
If you are counting on fidelity to the
text of Dumas' "The Count of Monte
Cristo," Kevin Reynolds' adaptation will
leave you wondering if it is at all based
upon the book. But if, like the average
sod iti the theatre, you haven't got a clue
about the book or have forgotten about it,
and you're just looking for swashbuckling
feel-good fare, this is one movie that
you'll relish.
Kdmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel), a naive
sailor distinguished solely by the beauty
<>l his fiancee, is betrayed by his aristo
cratic friend Fernand Mondego (Guy
Pearce) for no apparent reason apart
from jealousy. Napoleon Bonaparte uses
Dantes as a courier fora treasonous let
ter, and, with the connivance of the ship's
first mate and the Magistrate Villefort, he
is banished to the Chateau D If.
As expected, the jailor is a sadist who
inflicts annual lashings 011 his victims.
Dantes is reconciled to counting the
bricks of his cell for amusement while
growing copious amounts of hair. I lis life
takes a turn for the better when his floor
breaks open to reveal Abbe Faria (the
inimitable Richard Harris, most recently
seen as Albus Dumbledore in "Harry Pot
ter and the Sorceror's Stone"). It turns
out that Abbe Faria was digging an es
cape tunnel and mistakenly entered
Dantes' cell.
In exchange for his help in tunneling,

Abbe Faria gives Dantes a crash course in
subjects like Fconomics and Politics, reiv
ing upon his leather-bound copies of
"The Wealth of Nations" and"The
Prince." It can only have been divine in
tervention that helped the priest obtain a
library in his cell!
While teaching Dantes the laws of sup
ply and demand, Abbe Faria also plays
Sherlock Holmes and helps Dantes an
swer the question as to why he has been
imprisoned. They also feast on such un
fortunate rats that can be caught and
make Dantes an expert swordsman.
Fo make a long story short, Dantes
manages to escape and funds his revenge

with the help of the treasure-map that
Abbe Faria entrusts him with. Dantes rein
vents himself as the Count of Monte Cristo
and becomes the toast of Parisian society
after a spectacular descent from a hot air
balloon, then plots his diabolical scheme.
It is here that the movie's departure
from Dumas is most apparent. While
Dumas's Count is a diabolically elaborate
plotter, Reynolds' version lacks depth.
Dumas also conveyed a message when
the Count realizes that he cannot play
Cod. That realization is clearly absent in
the movie.
Further, Reynolds has dispensed with
many of Dumas' characters in the movie,

perhaps to simplify
the story, and also
to stay true to I lol
ly wood's love for
happy endings.
As Dantes,
Caviezel is very
good. He portrays
Dantes' pain quite
well and does man
age to look quite
dashing as the
Count. It is Guy
Pearce as Fernand
Mondego who pre
sents a mixed bag.
He alternates be
tween aristocratic
bearing and "Me
mento"-ish weird-

ness. There is no doubt, however, that he
looks positively criminal. Perhaps those
growing-up years in Australia helped.
Dagmara Domincyzk looks ravishing as
Dantes' lover Mercedes. Unfortunately
her character lacks depth, and that is
surely our loss. Richard 11 arris is brilliant
as always.
That Hollywood has once again failed
to capture the genius of the written word
must come as no surprise. It is amazing
that repeated attempts at filming books
must result in shallow adaptations. Sure
ly it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make
a success out of a classic book?
Perhaps the only silver lining in 1 lolly
wood's ham-handed attempts to bring lit
erature to celluloid is the inducement it
gives to people to read the original works.
Dumas' " The I hree Musketeers," "The
Man in the Iron Mask" and"The Count
of Monte (Iristo" all draw heavily from Ins
colorful life. He played a part in the 1830
Revolution while fathering illegitimate
children and dodging his creditors, and
his writings shall be the fodder for many
more movie adaptations.

from jealousy. Napoleon Bonaparte uses
Dantes as a courier fora treasonous let
ter, and, with the connivance of the ship's
first mate and the Magistrate Villefort, he
is banished to the Chateau D If.
As expected, the jailor is a sadist who
inflicts annual lashings 011 his victims.
Dantes is reconciled to counting the
bricks of his cell for amusement while
growing copious amounts of hair. I lis life
takes a turn for the better when his floor
breaks open to reveal Abbe Faria (the
inimitable Richard Harris, most recently
seen as Albus Dumbledore in "Harry Pot
ter and the Sorceror's Stone"). It turns
out that Abbe Faria was digging an es
cape tunnel and mistakenly entered
Dantes' cell.
In exchange for his help in tunneling,

Abbe Faria gives Dantes a crash course in
subjects like Fconomics and Politics, reiv
ing upon his leather-bound copies of
"The Wealth of Nations" and"The
Prince." It can only have been divine in
tervention that helped the priest obtain a
library in his cell!
While teaching Dantes the laws of sup
ply and demand, Abbe Faria also plays
Sherlock Holmes and helps Dantes an
swer the question as to why he has been
imprisoned. They also feast on such un
fortunate rats that can be caught and
make Dantes an expert swordsman.
Fo make a long story short, Dantes
manages to escape and funds his revenge

with the help of the treasure-map that
Abbe Faria entrusts him with. Dantes rein
vents himself as the Count of Monte Cristo
and becomes the toast of Parisian society
after a spectacular descent from a hot air
balloon, then plots his diabolical scheme.
It is here that the movie's departure
from Dumas is most apparent. While
Dumas's Count is a diabolically elaborate
plotter, Reynolds' version lacks depth.
Dumas also conveyed a message when
the Count realizes that he cannot play
Cod. That realization is clearly absent in
the movie.
Further, Reynolds has dispensed with
many of Dumas' characters in the movie,

perhaps to simplify
the story, and also
to stay true to I lol
ly wood's love for
happy endings.
As Dantes,
Caviezel is very
good. He portrays
Dantes' pain quite
well and does man
age to look quite
dashing as the
Count. It is Guy
Pearce as Fernand
Mondego who pre
sents a mixed bag.
He alternates be
tween aristocratic
bearing and "Me
mento"-ish weird-

ness. There is no doubt, however, that he
looks positively criminal. Perhaps those
growing-up years in Australia helped.
Dagmara Domincyzk looks ravishing as
Dantes' lover Mercedes. Unfortunately
her character lacks depth, and that is
surely our loss. Richard 11 arris is brilliant
as always.
That Hollywood has once again failed
to capture the genius of the written word
must come as no surprise. It is amazing
that repeated attempts at filming books
must result in shallow adaptations. Sure
ly it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make
a success out of a classic book?
Perhaps the only silver lining in 1 lolly
wood's ham-handed attempts to bring lit
erature to celluloid is the inducement it
gives to people to read the original works.
Dumas' " The I hree Musketeers," "The
Man in the Iron Mask" and"The Count
of Monte (Iristo" all draw heavily from Ins
colorful life. He played a part in the 1830
Revolution while fathering illegitimate
children and dodging his creditors, and
his writings shall be the fodder for many
more movie adaptations.
