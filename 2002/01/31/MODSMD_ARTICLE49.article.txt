"In Xanadu did kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man ..
— from "Kubla Khan" by Samuel Taylor Coleridgi

(her Christmas break, 1 spotted several newspaper ads
>r the re-release of "2001: A Space ()dyssev", all featuring
lie message, "S I ILL I lIL ULTIMATL LRU'." But while
lie light show in the film's closing minutes is still one of the
rippiest moments in cinema historv, there's a problem —
\all just pictures on a screen, a collection of images rather
lian the experience that you'd expect the "ultimate trip" to
ie. There's still a barrier between the hallucinations and the
udience.
1 hat barrier is exactly what the Antenna Theater's lat
st show "EUPHORIUM" tears down. Part bold experi
uent in theater, part hokey amusement park attraction,

that inspired
Samuel Taylor
(loleridge to write
his poem "Kubla
Khan." It sends
audience mem
bers staggering
disoriente d
through a confiis-

ing maze of illusions.
"Kl TI 1( )R!UM" first opened in the Spring of 2001 fora
sell-out 10-week run, and reopened last October in the Pre
sidio. It's way the hell in the middle nowhere (the first two
taxis that the theater called to pick me up got lost trying to
find the place), but, if you have a car, cash and good direc
tions. it's worth it.
In its current incarnation, the experience begins in an
"Opium Lounge," an oriental-style room where patrons
can sip drinks and t hat while waiting for their turn. Kvery
three minutes, a sylph-like hostess leads someone into the
maze's antechamber, where she adorns the audience mem
ber with .1 special set of headphones and an Ml'3-player.
Soon, you enter the maze, and, after a brief expositors
passage that welcomes you into Coleridge's mind, you don
a special helmet that obscures your vision ahead, showing
instead reflected visions of the strange sculptures and flash
ing lights hanging 112 rom the roof above. You wander along
slowly, your hand along a guide rail. A creepy electronica
soundtrack plays in the background, different sounds and
music activated as you enter different rooms. Actors, their
voices distorted, chatter lines from the poem.
l ire first thing you notice is the visual experience. At var
ious points throughout the 20-utinute show, you will see all
the unforgettable imagery front "Kubla Khan" floating
ahead of you. The caves of ice, the dulcimer-playing
Abyssinian maid and Kubla Khan himself: they're all here,
exaggerated, distorted and often painted in garish colors.
Viewed objectively, though, there's nothing really that
special. Just painted sculptures, some strobe lights ... you
might even call it cheesy.

However, to be objective is to miss out on the fun, and
lii st you'd have to resist the wonderful, moody and alwa\ s
c hanging score, the very real feeling of disorientation that
wearing the helmet gives and the power of Coleridge's
poem itself.
Like "kubla Khan", it's probably possible to draw some
sort of meaning from "EUPF IORIUM," but (at more enjoy
able is experiencing it on its own terms. For 20 minutes, you
walk uncertain of what lies ahead, unable to escape the fan
tastic visions and the crazed, beautiful words whispered in
your ears. It's a glorious funhouse; perhaps not the ultimate
trip, but pretty damn close.
And it's legal.


Dude, trippy.
