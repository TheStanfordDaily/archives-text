hjhtors Xotc: Thi.s is the second of a three
part sons examining the freshman humanities
requirement, currently the Introduction to the
Ilinnanitics program, this stiny s un>eys sln
dent ami facility opinions ahout IHUM —
which goes up fat review next year — as it
stands today Tomorrow, The Daily will explore
the future oj the program.
< Despite widespread grumbling about
111l \1 and the occasional direct hit
against it, cnd-ol'quarter evaluations o(
the program report that student satisfac
tion is on the i ise; however, a I )ailv survey
lotind that two-thirds ol students polled
think 111l M should be < hanged.
Vice Provost for I ndergraduate Kclu
cat ion John P»ra\ man. whose oil ice oxer
sees the program, said. "I'm sure this will
guarantee howls ol laughter in some
quarters, hut il is absolutcK a success.
I hafsa statistic al lad, knowingthat there
are some real < ritics."
I he evaluation statistics show that sat
islaction increased Irom two \'ears ago to
last year. ()n a live-point scale, fall quarter
courses' scores jumped from IV I to 3.9,
winter quarter c lasses k >se from 3.0 to 3.8,

and spring quarter in< reased from 3.0 to
3.7 in the overall evaluation categon.
In addition, the overall evaluation ol
111l M discussion sections rose from 1.0 in
1909 to 1.2 in the autumn quarter of2ooo.
"On the whole, |student responses!
ha\'egotten really vci \ mm h better in the
past couple ofvears," said 111l M \ssoc.
I )irector (iheri R< iss.
As lIIUM goes belorethe fac ult\ Sen
ate for its live-year review next year, ad
ministrators expect that any < hanges will
be minor rather than major.
"The usual lile ol general education
requirements is 10 scat s rather than live,
so I would think that we would probabh
see whether we can line-tune this one
rather than starting all ovci again,' said
C.ogni/ant Dean loi the Humanities
Keith Baker.
I listory Prof. Paul Robinson was head
ola track in 111l Ms predecessor. ('.ul
tures, Ideas and Values, and head ol
(llV's predecessor. Western ( i\ili/ation.
"there is nothing unusual about the

review, excepl lor llie lad thai this pro
gram lias been redone so main limes," he
said. "Bui I don'i hear a groundswcll loi
[major < hangcs| lo happen; the preced
ing changes were always preceded b\ .1
10l ol rut kns.
Survey illuminates dissatisfaction
A minor conlroversN erupted last vear
when sevei.il freshmen expressed ilieii
displeasure with the program during
(licit 1111 M linal. I he students sat to
gether. wearing t-shiils that spelled out
"F* !! K IHI M."
Bravman said students with vehement
• nili-1111 \l sentiment are in the minori
ty. "It becomes, (juite lrank.lv, the cool
thing to sav. to complain about certain
things," he s.iid. "Completcl) honestly,
the majoriiN opinion, usually when stu
dents are in small'groups rather than
large groups, is, 'What are you talking
about, I love Mil M.'That's the lionest
to-Ciod response I have gotten hundreds
ol limes."
A Daih survey reports that two-thirds
ola random sample ol .">() sophomores
and juniors would like 111l \1 to be
( hanged. Still, 59 percent said they were
glad that the) look Mil M, and <S«X per
cent said they were in liivor ol having .111
Area ()ne re(|uirenient.
In their responses lo The Dail\ s sur
vev. mam students complained about the
superlit ialit\ ol 1111 \I.
'Tor some reason, 111l \l is designed
to be such a broaclsurvc\ course tliat there
is 110 in-depth coverage ol an\ lopi<." said
junior international relations major
Michael ()lsen. " I r\inglo link the Bible to
Blade Runner to ancient Chinese texts
ma\ be interesting hypothclicallv. but in
aclualitx it is ridiculous. I lie< 0111 se is so lo
dised 011 making inane connections that
the designers Ihrgot that it is impossible to
discuss a c lassi< work in nicrch three
hours ol discussion in one week.
Bakei s,nd he sees this as .1 problem 111
herein in designing am introclucton
course. " I he more von stress the theme
the more dilli< nil it is to get into each ol
the works individually." he said.
Requirements constrain students
Ihe mandate thai students take
111l M freshman veat not onl\ prevents



AARON STAPIE/The Stanford Daily
students from taking many de
sired classes, i( also can be a sched
uling headache, according to some
students.
"Just make Area One like all the
other OF.Rs," recommended ju
nior I hinh Nguyen, a chemical
engineering major.
Furthermore, many students
enter Stanford without an inten
tion to continue studying the hu
manities. ()l the admits in the
(llassof 200"), 'M \ percent reported
that the) expected to primarily
concentrate in the natural sci
ences, 2<S percent social sciences
and 22 percent engineering, ac
cording to data from the Under
graduate Advising Center. Only
14 percent said they planned lo
focus on the humanities.
With such low levels of interest,
1111 M may have an effect on stu
dents that is opposite to one of its
goals; the program has the poten
tial to repel students from the
field, ac cording to some.
"Instead of getting students in
terested in the humanities,
11111 M| c liases them away because
the subject areas become merely an
annoying requirement toget out of
the way," said sophomore Jenny
Provost, a biology major.
Former University President
C.erhard Casper said he believes
that this i ritique can apply to any
kind of required course, not just
hum.
"You call something a require
ment, that very minute ii frus
trates people," he said. "Well, uni
versities are there lo frustrate peo
ple, in part, so they can become
more creative."
junior Cln is Rael, who is ma
joring in computer science, said
he now appreciates his IHUM
experience.
"As much as I enjoyed com
plaining about IHUM, I am cer
tainly glad to have taken it,"he
said. "IHUM has forced me to

round out an academic routine
that would otherwise he numbers
and computer chips."
Faculty question structure,
retention
According to many faculty
members, the most questionable
part of 1111 M isthe jump from the
lull interdisciplinary courses to the
winter-spring departmental se
quences, also known as the one
plus-two setup.
"()ne-plus-two is [the] most du
bious [thing] about the HU M
program at present," (lasper said.
('.lassies Prof. Marsh McCall
agreed.
"1 don't think that anyone as
sociated with the I HUM pro
gram thinks that the connections
between the fall term courses
and the winter-spring sequences
are seamless," he said. McCall
taught the "Tradition and Revo
lution" HUM in the fall and is
teaching "Power and Passion"
this quarter.
lIIUM Program Director Rob
Robinson said he sees the one
plus-two setup as advantageous
because it allows students to make
a more informed decision about
their winter-spring sequence.
"One thing that was brilliant
about the design committee's de
sign is that students don't have to
make a choice that is going to com
mit them to .111 entire year, until
they're here and they've already
got seven weeks ol experience
under their belts," he said.
In the 1999 in-house review of
the program, then-Director I larry
112 lam, professor of Drama, high
lighted the questionable relation
ship between the lall quarter and
the winter-spring quarters as an
area for improvement. In addi
tion. the weak link between lIIIM
<md the required freshman writ
ing course was targeted as some
thing to work on.
Program ollicials identified fac
ulty retention for fall quarter
courses as another problem with
lIIUM, despite the fad that pro
lessors receive funding to develop

their courses.
"The reason we have to do the
seed money thing is that depart
ments don't have any stake in the
fall courses," Robinson said. "We
have to approach that from the
perspective of getting the faculty
members to, in a sense, stand up to
their departments."
As with any large-scale course,
designing the program well may
only be half the battle.
"I believe the format is a good
one and I believe that it can im
prove, said Comparative Litera
ture and French & Italian Prof.
Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, who
taught the fall quarter course
"Things of Beauty" this year and
last. "Of course, no format ever is a
guarantee that the class will be
taught well. I here are dearly bad
IHUMs."
First-year Teaching Fellow
Fmma Blake taught "The Art of
Living" in the lall and says the
three professors for the course
went out of their way to connect
with the more than 200 students.
I hey visited her sections, held fat -
uity teas and occasionally had
question and answer sessions in
stead of lectures.
"That kind of comes down to
personality," she said. "I have
heard of other cases where the
professors were very distant. It
would be nice if that were built into
the structure."
"Warts and all"
Ihe Faculty Senate review
next year will take into account
student, I F and faculty evalua
tions of the program, as well as
information from senior surveys
and focus groups.
"We're trying to make it as seri
ous an evaluation as we possibly
can, warts and all, and I'm sure we
will find warts," said Rob Robin
son, director ol I HUM.
Bravman promises the review
next year will be thorough. "II it's
trappy I'm not going to say it's
good," he said. "It's a very expen
sive program I am paying for, so I
want it to be really good."
