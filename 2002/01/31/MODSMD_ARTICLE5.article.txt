< Despite widespread grumbling about
111l \1 and the occasional direct hit
against it, cnd-ol'quarter evaluations o(
the program report that student satisfac

are some real < ritics."
I he evaluation statistics show that sat

and spring quarter in< reased from 3.0 to

As lIIUM goes belorethe fac ult\ Sen
ate for its live-year review next year, ad
ministrators expect that any < hanges will
be minor rather than major.
"The usual lile ol general education
requirements is 10 scat s rather than live,
so I would think that we would probabh
see whether we can line-tune this one
rather than starting all ovci again,' said
C.ogni/ant Dean loi the Humanities
Keith Baker.
I listory Prof. Paul Robinson was head
ola track in 111l Ms predecessor. ('.ul
tures, Ideas and Values, and head ol

"there is nothing unusual about the

review, excepl lor llie lad thai this pro
gram lias been redone so main limes," he
said. "Bui I don'i hear a groundswcll loi
[major < hangcs| lo happen; the preced

Survey illuminates dissatisfaction
A minor conlroversN erupted last vear
when sevei.il freshmen expressed ilieii
displeasure with the program during
(licit 1111 M linal. I he students sat to
gether. wearing t-shiils that spelled out
"F* !! K IHI M."
Bravman said students with vehement
• nili-1111 \l sentiment are in the minori
ty. "It becomes, (juite lrank.lv, the cool
thing to sav. to complain about certain
things," he s.iid. "Completcl) honestly,
the majoriiN opinion, usually when stu
dents are in small'groups rather than
large groups, is, 'What are you talking
about, I love Mil M.'That's the lionest
to-Ciod response I have gotten hundreds
ol limes."
A Daih survey reports that two-thirds
ola random sample ol .">() sophomores
and juniors would like 111l \1 to be
( hanged. Still, 59 percent said they were
glad that the) look Mil M, and <S«X per
cent said they were in liivor ol having .111
Area ()ne re(|uirenient.
In their responses lo The Dail\ s sur
vev. mam students complained about the
superlit ialit\ ol 1111 \I.
'Tor some reason, 111l \l is designed
to be such a broaclsurvc\ course tliat there
is 110 in-depth coverage ol an\ lopi<." said
junior international relations major
Michael ()lsen. " I r\inglo link the Bible to
Blade Runner to ancient Chinese texts
ma\ be interesting hypothclicallv. but in
aclualitx it is ridiculous. I lie< 0111 se is so lo
dised 011 making inane connections that
the designers Ihrgot that it is impossible to
discuss a c lassi< work in nicrch three
hours ol discussion in one week.
Bakei s,nd he sees this as .1 problem 111
herein in designing am introclucton
course. " I he more von stress the theme
the more dilli< nil it is to get into each ol
the works individually." he said.
