Listening to "Point" is like chan
nel-surfing across 69,000 crystal-clear analog
wavelengths of global super-pop. Sounds
Inn, right? Cornelius has said that, given the
chance to release any artist on his chic Tratto
ria label, he would choose "D J Shadow produc

ing Michael Jackson" — which is a rough ap
proximation of "Point" 's wildly innovative musi
cal collage. "Point" deftly collides the ingredients
that have made so many of today's best-selling
mannequins popular — buttery hip-hop beats,
sweet vocal harmonies and catchy acoustic guitar
lines — with the cut-up turntable rhythms and
sampler-happy synth games pioneered by the
music industry's creative fringe. Cornelius then
lakes a color photograph of this collision, cuts it up
into small pieces and pastes it back together in a
mosaic that resembles a pleasant day at some kind
of futuristic beach, complete with obligatory sam
ples of waves crashing and birdsong.
Cornelius, a.k.a. Keigo Oyamada, grew up in
the Shibuya district ofTokvo, birthplace of the oft
hyped cross-cultural-indie-pop phenomenon that
.ill too often sounds like Pizzicato Five. In fact,
nearly all of it sounds exactly like Pizzicato Five.
But Cornelius produced a P5 record at the tender
age of 21; as G.B. Shaw once said, "he's on some
next shit." Everything on this disc, from ambient
bubbles and fuzz. to heavy metal (!) to breakbeats,
is bizarre and catchy. Cornelius's obsessive atten
tion to detail and inspired musical mutations

make "Point" perfect for con
templative headphone trip
pers and the short attention
span jet-set alike. More-

over, it all sounds so
fresh and clean com-

pared to just about
anything else out

there. This is
music from the fu
ture. Beck is about
to hang himself
with a guitar
string because he

112 didn't make
"Point" first. After
all, he had ample
warning in the form

of Takako
Minekawa's 1999 opus
"Fun 9" (Japanese pro
nunciation = "funk.")
Cornelius wrote the

music tor the nest tracks
on "Fun 9," which can only
be described as a lovely
marriage of analog astro
lunk with acoustic bossa

nova, and which serves
as a tasty counterpart to

"Point" (shameless

Minekawa plug
ends here).
This disc irets

. UK, WKTV
four stars be
cause, while tin
deniably brilliant
compared to

most of what's being advertised as the future of
music (e.g. the testosterone-addled Kmart stylings

of Creed), it's still not quite as groundbreaking as
Cornelius's 1998 U.S. debut, "Fantasma," which
was the aural equivalent of a trip to Tokyo Dis
neyland on acid. "Fantasma" was essential.
"Point" is fantastic, but it's more of a kaleidoscope
than a roller coaster. Where "Fantasma" was ram
bunctious and tangled, "Point" is more sophisti
cated. "Fantasma" covered the entire spectrum,
from weird noises to saccharine pop, while "Point"
takes choice bits from each end of that spectrum
and combines them in unpredictably funky ways.
So, funky kaleidoscopic soundscapes or the
new ('.reed? Remember that you do have a choice
... now go, informed consumer, and use your
purchasing power for good, not evil! Maybe if he
sells enough records here, Cornelius will grace the
Bay Area with his flabbergasting live show, which
apparently features 3-1) video hula dancers,
"karate spacemen and fantasy apes," and a cover
of Flvis's "Love Me Tender" on the theremin.
(Lome on — musical preferences aside, everybody
likes fantasy apes ...
