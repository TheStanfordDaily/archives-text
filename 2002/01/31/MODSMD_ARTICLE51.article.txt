Dear Roxy,
M\ girlfriend recently told me that she
would like to try what she called
HDSM. Vm pretty open to hying new
things, hut I don't even know what
that means. I)o I need ropes? Chains?
A hoy scout?
Signed.
Knot So Sure
Dear Knot,
First, I applaud the openness of
your relationship. Clearly you're
communicating famously and you
feel comfortable enough with each
other to delve into these nether re
gions of sexuality. Now I will at
tempt to give you a small glimpse
into the world of BDSM, and maybe
together we can satisfy your girl
friend's new fetish.
BDSM is shorthand for
Bondage Domination Submission
and Masochism. Perhaps I rent
Re/nor summed it up most elo

quently in his lvrical ballad "Head
l.ii e A 1 loleßow down before the
one you serve You're going to get
what you deserve.
Basically you can have a lot of fun
with this, but it takes more time,
preparation and communication
than the average college student is
willing to invest in his or her sex life.
So how can the just-post-adolescent
guy make a good showing in the
BDSM arena? I fere are some tips.
1. Time: Anything in this realm of
sexual experience is not something
to be undertaken unadvisedly. This
is not the activity to embark on be
cause you got bored at the I ree
House and walking to Happy
Donuts is out of the question. You
need time to make this a worthwhile
experience. Time, I tell you. Plan
this fora day or evening when you
are certain to have privacy, have no
problem sets looming and can take
things slowly. Unless she wants it
fast. And that brings us to the next

imperative element...
2. Preparation: I his is not a show
up and dance kinda thing. For
BDSM, the very least vou'll have to
do in terms of prep is find a sturdy
tie (I'd recommend a nice Jerry (»ar
cia or Brooks Brothers), and have a
little pre-festivity discussion (more
about that later). If you are serious
about it. you'll want to make a pil
grimage to I lonie Depot. You want
to make someone's dav? Tell (>lenda
on aisle 28 that Roxy sent you. She'll
show you straight to the rope that
doesn't leave burns but ties securely,
and then she'll point you out to
about five other Depot employees.
They'll snicker. They'll laugh. But
you'll be having hot kinky sex, so I
think you can take it. If you're a psy
chotic researcher, definitely check
out Jay Wiseman's Erotic Bondage
I lanclbook. (You may want to check
it out even if you're not. There's a
used one for sale on Amazon.)
For those of you on some sort

of financial aid (and the cheap
bastards), check out a Web site
called the Deviant s Dictionary.
It's quite classy:

knots.htm
I his site is especially useful if all
you're looking for is a limb-immo
bilization situation. It's got close
ups. Unfortunately the close-ups
are of knots.

(x)mmunication: Perhaps the
most important aspect ofBDSM in
teractions is pi e-encounter consulta
tion. To enjoy this, both the Domi
nant and the Submissive must feel
comfortable, and arguably the most
important way to do this is by estab
lishing a "s;ife word." Before any
bondage happens, you and your
partner should decide on a word

that halts all activity. It is invoked to
indicate to your partner that what's
going on is not desired or is becoin
ing unpleasurable. In this situation,
"Stop it, bitch" could Ik- something
vou'd say when you're happy with
the vv; ly things are going, so your safe
W()t d should be something bland but
esoteric. Like "Freud." Or "Clam
bake." Unless you often exclaim ei
ther of those in the heat of passion.
Whatever word you pick,
whichever rope you decide on, what
ever day suits your plans, remember
that you should do this only with
someone you mist completely. It'sthe
sexual equivalent of "fiill backwards,
I'll catch you ... and tie you up."
Go forth and dominate.
()r sublimate.
