I lenncss\ s.iid.

Last (all. in the begin
ning of this fiscal year,
Stanford I fospitals and
Clinics projected $ ( .).7
million in losses on
$722.a million of operat
ing revenues. The previ
ous fiscal year, the) re
ported losses totalling
$27 million, according to

the San Francisco ( hronicle.
Medical ('.enler ollicials have attributed
those losses to .1 number of factors, includ
ing the increased costs <>l medical ecjuip
ment and drugs, and sub-par reimburse
ment from health coverage.
While Marsh said she w ill be looking
at such problems, she also will use the
same proactive style that helped estab
lish the I (.-Davis Medit al ( enter as the
most desirable health t are center in the
Sacramento area, and perhaps all of
Northern (California.
"I think what makes |l)a\is) successful is
a good strategy that is attractive to patients
in all of \orthei n ( California," Marsh said.
"When I get [to Stan lord], I plan on realh

l<x)kingat what the strengths of (he
program are, and what makes it re
ally unique.
"1 will also be trying to lind ways
toexp<>se the public to the quality of
Stanford's Medical (Center."
From there, Marsh said she
plans to build on the Medical (Cen
ter's existing strengths and nur
ture them.
"The question we will be asking
is,'l low c an we take that quality and
develop new programs around ii to
make ii even better?'" Marsh ex
plained, outlining her problem
solving strategy.
"Often when challenges arise,
administrators try to lind certain
problems and will try to lix them.
But its never one individual prob
lem that's weak," she continued.
"It's a matter of focusing in,
yes, but you have to also look at
the big picture," she said.
"Is what we're doing cost-ef
fective? Are we stalled at the right
level? I lave we negotiated for the
best pay rate so that everyone is
happy?"
Marsh said she believes her role
at Stanford will involve the same
skills she acquired while earning
her MBA at Columbia University,

and which she has honed lor the last
20 years.
"It's like any business, really,"
Marsh said. "Balancing the in
come and the spending, figuring
out strategic plans for the future
and seeking to build new pro
grams, new strategies and new in
formation systems."
Marsh, nc > stranger to university
alliliated medical centers, has a well
established track record in both
managing and developing health
care organizations.

nior analyst at Arthur Andersen

Pennsylvania Health System, be

Davis has been recognized as one of
the nation's leading systems in the
fields of rural medicine, primary
care and telehealth.
