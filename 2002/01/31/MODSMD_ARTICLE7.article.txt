## A 						'Priceless' Experience 
### IRENE NOGUCHI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If \on io plaining' a road trip this suin
mer, take advice Ironi Iwo guvs who did ii
back in 199M — litv weeks ol live tours, live
food and lots ol live beer.
I lial's what Stanford alinnni Dave Kaval
and Brad Null did aftci the\ graduated.
\nd dic\ ended up on 1- SI * N Sportsrentei
and < o-wrote a book.
Not to mention that the) ne.irl\ sued—
and latei nearh went into business with — a
little ( redit < ard < onipain (ailed MasieK .ard.
It wasn't planned. the\ s.iv I hex wanted
to 11111 ill a boyhood dream: can ha game at
.ill !W) Majoi I vague baseball pai kv
I he tw is! ?
I liev did it in 38 d,i\ s.

"Wc onl\ had .i f()-da\ window because
Brad's brother was getting married," said
kaval, now in his first year ai Stanford Busi
ness S< hool.
1 it kets weren't ( heap, so he asked teams
to sponsor them. When the (iiants weren't in
terested. K,i\,il said, "I told them the Dodders
were gi\ ing us |free tickets), and the\ said. 'If
the Dodders are. then we are. ten"
So began Brad and Dave's excellent ad
venture.
Null, mm a consultant lot oneept.net, re
members the private tout of Dodgers Stadi
um. "We had been on I \ the night before
and were sort of celebrities." he s.iid.
Soon, the guys from Store\ House were
shaking bands with I omnn l.asorda and
Vin Scully and sitting in seats usu
ally reserved for the one and only
(ieorge Steinbrenner, owner of
the New York Yankees. And
everywhere they went, they tal
lied a map and their sign:
"Baseball America Tour '98."
"People were curious to meet
lis," kaval said. "It's an urban leg
end that you go lo all the ballparks,
but you never meet anyone who
actually lias done it."
Baseball lans signed their map
everywhere they went. At times
the two were running "011 pure
adrenaline," Kaval said, going a
stretch of 19 ballparks in 19 days.
But nothing compared to the
drive from Tampa Bay to Balti
more, the day they (all "the 1,001
mile odyssey."

It took If) hours. 1 heir friend
Aaron Weisner, along lor the ride
lot two weeks, ottered to drive.
"For eight or nine hours
straight, [Aaron] just keepsdriving
and driving and driving," Kaval
recalled. "lie's in the /one. Then
he turns to me and says, 'Dave, I'm
going all the way.' I had to lake a
bathroom stop, or else we were
going to die."
Finally, 43 rolls of film later,
their "summer to remember"
came to an end at Kaulfman Stadi
um in Kansas City. The 30th ball
park in 38 days.
"'l'lie whole thing felt like <1
dream come true," Kaval said. "No
one was there at the end. Just Brad
and I."
1 hey compiled their stories
into a book, " I he Summer That
Saved Baseball," which came out
last February.
Then MasterCard released an
unexpected surprise: a series of

live "priceless" commercials about
two guys touring baseball parks.
()ne ad showed both guys at C lam
den Yards, looking at a road map
filled with signatures.
" 1 hat was too close," Ravalsaid.
" I hat was exactly out of Our trip."
Null and k.iv.il c ontac ted
lawyers who said they might havea
copyright (ase. Hut the two did not
have the money to hire anyone.
Instead, they wrote a letter to
the CKO of MasterCard, and the
head of legal services called them
three weeks later. Kaval said he
hoped MasterCard would issue
their "Baseball" books to new < us
tomers, but any hope of a deal
evaporated when two men from
Minnesota sued the card compa
ny, claiming the commeri ials were
based on their 1998 documentan
of a similar trip.
Now MasterCard will not re
turn Kaval and Null s t ails. I nless
they can get a pro bono lawyer,

Kaval said, anv deal is "100 per
cent dead."
Nowadays, Null plays lor a
baseball league between consult
ing jobs. Kaval wants to manage a
sports team. Preferably baseball,
he said.
I lie magical summer of 199H
threw two friends into the heat of
Sammy Sosa and Mark Maguire's
historic race lor a new home run
record.
It was good to see lans "love the
game, and they're there with their
kids, father, grandfather," said
Kaval. adding that bis highlight
was spending the last night sleep
ing in the real "Field ol Dreams"
in lowa.
I raveling wit It the same guy lot
3<S days may have been like a "one
room double in Wilbur," Kaval ad
mitted. But, Null said, "we're bet
ter friends now because of it."
Next up for the duo? All 12
Japanese ballparks in I I days.
