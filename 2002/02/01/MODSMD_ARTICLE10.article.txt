# Tech grad schools find boost in applications

The booming economy of the 1990s was
superseded by an unpredictable bust in the
years approaching the end of the millenni
um. Empty office buildings and shattered
hopes mark the remains of the once-effer
vescent dot-com.
In light of the slumping economy, industry
professionals have scrambled to find the best
alternative, and many have opted to go back
to school. Indeed, the Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering Departments at Stan
lord have witnessed a substantial increase in
the number of graduate school applicants.
"The [CS] department has seen a 40 per
cent increase in the number of graduate
school applications for fall 2002 admissions."
said Kathleen Ditommaso, director of com
puter science graduate admissions. In addi
tion to an increase in the number of applica
tions, the department has experienced a yield
increase as well, she said.

Despite the boost in the number of com
puter science graduate school applicants, Dit
ommaso saicl the department does not keep
track of where these individuals come from —
industry or academia — and therefore can
not attribute the boom exclusively to individ
uals from industry.
"People are appreciating more the value of
a good education," said Computer Science
Dept. Chair Hector Carcia-Molina. "We'll
have a better prepared work force."
Across the street, the Department of
Electrical Engineering has experienced a
similar trend.
"We have facts to show that the numbers
of applicants has increased, said Robert
Cray, the department s vice chair. "We ac
cepted about the number we usually do, but
more came."
"In the spring of 2000, students were rush
ing to finish their Ph.D.'s," said Electrical En
gineering Prof. John (.ill, "I was startled to see
the increase in the number ol applications this

year."
Neither department plans to increase the
number of available spots to compensate for
the jump in the number of graduate school
applicants, meaning that admission into both
programs is becoming more competitive.
According to Gill, the large class si/e be
comes apparent around the time of the quali
fying exams.
Aside from examinations, the larger num
bers of students in the more popular classes is
another indication of an increase in the num
ber of graduate students.
Students in both programs confirmed the
heightened demand for graduate studies in
their fields. Computer science graduate stu
dent Pedram Kayani saicl, " The economy is
not good .. . people are taking t his opportu
nity to advance, but whose to say the\ 11 si ill be
motivated when the economy is good."
