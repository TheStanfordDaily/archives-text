# Tech grad schools find boost in applications

### ALI ALEMOZAFAR 
The booming economy of the 1990s was
superseded by an unpredictable bust in the
years approaching the end of the millenni
um. Empty office buildings and shattered
hopes mark the remains of the once-effer
vescent dot-com.
In light of the slumping economy, industry
professionals have scrambled to find the best
alternative, and many have opted to go back
to school. Indeed, the Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering Departments at Stan
lord have witnessed a substantial increase in
the number of graduate school applicants.
"The [CS] department has seen a 40 per
cent increase in the number of graduate
school applications for fall 2002 admissions."
said Kathleen Ditommaso, director of com
puter science graduate admissions. In addi
tion to an increase in the number of applica
tions, the department has experienced a yield
increase as well, she said.

Despite the boost in the number of com
puter science graduate school applicants, Dit
ommaso saicl the department does not keep
track of where these individuals come from —
industry or academia — and therefore can
not attribute the boom exclusively to individ
uals from industry.
"People are appreciating more the value of
a good education," said Computer Science
Dept. Chair Hector Carcia-Molina. "We'll
have a better prepared work force."
Across the street, the Department of
Electrical Engineering has experienced a
similar trend.
"We have facts to show that the numbers
of applicants has increased, said Robert
Cray, the department s vice chair. "We ac
cepted about the number we usually do, but
more came."
"In the spring of 2000, students were rush
ing to finish their Ph.D.'s," said Electrical En
gineering Prof. John (.ill, "I was startled to see
the increase in the number ol applications this

year."
Neither department plans to increase the
number of available spots to compensate for
the jump in the number of graduate school
applicants, meaning that admission into both
programs is becoming more competitive.
According to Gill, the large class si/e be
comes apparent around the time of the quali
fying exams.
Aside from examinations, the larger num
bers of students in the more popular classes is
another indication of an increase in the num
ber of graduate students.
Students in both programs confirmed the
heightened demand for graduate studies in
their fields. Computer science graduate stu
dent Pedram Kayani saicl, " The economy is
not good .. . people are taking t his opportu
nity to advance, but whose to say the\ 11 si ill be
motivated when the economy is good."
Sam kavusi. an electrical engineering
graduate student, could attest to
the changing times. "It was obvi
ous from quals slats this year,"
said kavusi. " 1 fie top 40 percent
made it, as opposed to the top 50
percent."
I'he two graduate programs
have also attracted more under
graduate students to stay a filth

year and take part in a co-terminal
master's program. Computer sci
ence lias seen an increase in the
number of co-term students, said
Garcia-Molina, though exact
numbers were not available.
"I ndergrads have always been
encouraged to go co-term," (iill
said, confirming that his depart
ment has seen a marked increase
in co-term applications.
Students currently in the grad
uate programs said the) have no
intention of rushing out into the

job market.
" The job market is a lot more
realistic than it once was. It's going
to be tougher to get good jobs, but
if you're good at what you cJo,
you're not going to have a prob
lem," Keyani said.
The turnaround from industry
to academia will ultimately boost
research, as these future acade
mics and investigators will guide
advanced research in the* future,
