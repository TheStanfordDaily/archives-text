# Sharon regrets not 'liquidating' Arafat
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Ariel Sharon says
he's sorry he didn't have Yasser Arafat "liqui
dated" while he had a chance — 20 years ago,
during an Israeli siege of Beirut.
Sharon's musings about the missed oppor
tunity, published yesterday, raised eyebrows
abroad but wouldn't have surprised most
Middle Easterners, where the bitter, decades
long personal enmity.is widely seen as a key
element of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Israeli prime minister spoke as his
tanks surrounded Arafat's compound in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, trapping the
Palestinian leader inside. His remarks in an
interview with the Maariv daily coincide with
speculation that this time, Sharon hopes to
finish off his old enemy.
"Sharon's words are very dangerous," said
Palestinian Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat. By ex
pressing regret about not killing Arafat in 1982,
Sharon "means he want to fix his mistake."
Erekat said.
As defense minister in 1982, Sharon di
rected an Israeli invasion of Lebanon, where

Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization
ruled .i virtual slate within a state. At first pre
sented as a 48-hour operation to move the
Palestinian forces out of southern Lebanon,
the war expanded and Israeli forces eventual
ly occupied Beirut.
Arafat, along with his top lieutenants and
many fighters, was forced to board ships
under the eye of the Israeli army and leave for
Tunisia. An Israeli sniper said later he had
Arafat in his gunsights, but instead of pulling
the trigger, he took a picture of the defeated
Palestinian leader.
"In Lebanon, there was an agreement not
to liquidate Yasser Arafat," Sharon told the
Maariv newspaper. "In principle, I'm sorry
that we didn't liquidate him."
Though Sharon has labeled Arafat and his
regime as terrorists, inciters and liars, Arafat
at least in the current crisis has not respond
ed in kind, refraining from personal attacks
on Israeli leaders in public. On Jan. 26, greet
ing visitors 112 rom I lebron to his encircled com
pound, the 72-year-old Arafat defied Sharon.
"I address these words to Sharon," Arafat

said. "If he thought that his tanks, which sur
round us now, will defeat us, he is mistaken.
These tanks will not shake us. They did not
shake us in Beirut."
A Palestinian close to Arafat said the em
battled leader feels Sharon is out to get him,
but Arafat does not express the same feelings
toward Sharon. 1 he Arafat confidant said the
Palestinian leader is not frightened by Sharon
and does not consider him a personal enemy.
Sharon's comments to the newspaper drew
stiff criticism from Spanish Foreign Minister
josep Pique, whose country holds the Euro
pean Union presidency. "I deplore them, and
they should not be accepted. Pique said.
Sharon's part in the Lebanon invasion drew
him a rebuke from an official Israeli commission
of inquiry, which found him indirectly responsi
ble fora massacre of Palestinian refugees in
Beirut by Christian militiamen in September
1982, while Sharon's troops controlled the area.
The commission forced Sharon to step down
as defense minister, but he slowlv made his way
back to the top of the Israeli politi
cal pyramid.
Arafat returned to center stage
in 1994, when he made a tri
umphant return to Palestinian
land to take over the autonomy
government created under inter
im peace accords.
