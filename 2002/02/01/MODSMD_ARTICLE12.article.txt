## The
						Stanford Daily Daily editor bids farewell to Volume 220, staff 
### 
I wonder if any ofiny predecessors left this job
feeling that they had accomplished all that
they set out to accomplish; run ;dl the stories
they'd promised, revamped each depart
ment they 'd pledged to revamp; reached out to all
the members of the Stanford community thev'd
intended; or succeeded in transforming the paper
to fit the vision they articulated in their platforms.
I certainly don't.
I feel like I've just gotten the hang of things -
learned how to spell the right names, return the
right phone calls and omit the right commas.
And now, just as my routine has become just that
— routine — and just as I feel ready to embark
on all my grand plans and noble conceptions,
my job is over.
When I came in to the office to turn in the first
story I ever wrote for The Daily, in the early fall of
my freshman year, I remember feeling an over
whelming sense of awe. 1 lie office was so busy. Ev
eryone was so professional. My editors were so
smart. Ilie comments they made about mv writ-

Published Since IS 1 )I

ing were so sophisticated. When die story —
which, I might add, was so uninteresting and
unimportant that I've blocked from my mind what
it was alxnit—ended up on die front page, 1
thought I had attained journalistic success. (I can
now imagine how slow a news day it must have
been, and how vociferously the editors must have
bitched al)out the necessity of placing it on page
one.)
Forced suddenly into a period of reflection on
the grand finale of my four years at this newspaper,
all I can think of is how completely die tables have
turned. In theory, the role reversal means that is
now I who holds a position to which younger staff
members l<x)k up. But when I say things have
come full circle, 1 mean it in a different sense.
I still experience that feeling of awe everyday I
spend here, but rather than being inspired by the
office I have risen to hold, I i(x>k up instead to the
dozens of editors, writers, photographer's and
I nisiness and ad executives on this staff.'lhere is no
doubt in my mind that the degree to which I am

impressed by the minute details of the work that
goes on around me each day transcends that of any
young staffer who nervously l(x>ks around the
bustling office for the first time.
I he only thing 1 feel I can honestly take full
credit for this volume is hiring my staff, a group
of men and women who have consistently and
steadily impiessed me with their talent, their
dedication, their commitment, patience, humor
and friendship.
The news department taught me about
earnestness, about care, precision and coopera
tion. Sports impressed me with their skill, their wit,
their consistency and their imagination. 1 hose in
the Opinions department - including the colum
nists and editorial board inemljers—embodied
most of what is fun and vibrant and challenging
aljout a student newspaper; the quality of their
writing, the breadth of their arguments and the ed
itors' grace under pressure struck me day after
day. The cohesion, the reliability, the indepen
dence and the attitude— not to mention the talent

greatest strengths of tliis organization. The Inter
mission and Innovation sections challenged and
comforted me, respectively. Intermission pro

confidence and their willingness to push die limits.
Innovation was consistent and unfailingly positive,
enormous assets. Graphics and production lx)tli

I'm not known as one who takes criticism well,
but my final thanks go to all those who gave it to
me. The quality of The Daily is directly related to
the amount that those in the Stanford communi
ty care to communicate with us, whether it l)e to
pitch a story, write a letter; give an interview, an
swer a question or point out a mistake.
