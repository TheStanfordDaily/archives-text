Out and the worst, with the disheartening,
gloomy discourse on our lives.
But after today, you won't be seeing
Two Guys Who Are Better Than You on
Fridays. Sad, perhaps, but the time has
come. Sometimes, we reason, you have
to go out while on top of the game. "But
Doug and Ramit," one of out friends re
minded lis, "you were never on top of
your game — you just ranted about
women and whatever else you wanted to
every single week. No one even wrote a
single letter to I he Daily that was pub
lished about you two." We realized he
was kind of right, so we punched him in
the face.
But in spite of our attempts to make
you sad at our departure, we have to
confess: we may have expected our so
cial commentary to repulse our readers,
but never our horribly ugly staff pic -
tures. Those were an accident, but
proved our point: if a picture is worth a
thousand words, then our pictures
spoke volumes for why we never felt the
sweetness of a woman's touch, except for
her backhand.
In any case, there are many topics we
considered covering during out tenure as
I~he Daily staff columnists, but never got
to because of too much work (see, Mom
and Dad?), too much IM and Mario Kart
and the overarching, guiding light of apa
thy. So, ladies and gentlemen, here's what
we once planned on ranting about but
were too lazy to actually write.
• John Taylor is really not that good of a
professor: In our first quarter freshman
year, nearly every upperclassman told us to
take John Taylor's Kcon 1 class. I le's su< h
a great professor," they told us, "and he
even wrote the book!" Yeah, that's delight
ful, but lecturing straight out of your own
Inxjk five days a week, with one of the worst
examples of technology-in the-classroom
ever (let's call long-dead Adam Smith on
the phone, ha ha!) makes us kindlv suggest
that those damn upperclassmen Taylor
apologists never speak again.
• Why don't girls poop?: Really, why?
• The University should change its mas
cot back to the Indians, only the Ramit
kind of Indian: We can all agree that this
is a democratic society. Since the will of this
campus is largely dictated by the majority,
we propose a change: in order to be more
representative, the mascot must revert to
the Indians. The Gates Building, for in
stance, is literally packed with Ph.D. FOBs.
No one can deny that this c ampus has a lot
of Indians! Thus, our proposal is logically

sound; S< m ales would be
proud.
• More women need to
visit our room.
• We need more bel
ligerent drunks: Serious
ly, isn't the risk of a "bel
ligerent" drunk tar out
weighed by the many,
many occasions when

you've pointed and laughed at your stupid
drunk friend? Yes.
So since we have the rest of the column
as free space for whatever we want, we'll be
damned if we're going to waste this oppor
tunity. (>1 anted, toda\ \s rants might smack
of the ramblings of two men who are on
their way out, but we're OK with that.
When it's your last column and there's no
accountability whatsoever, \ou tend to say
whatever the hell you want.
Ramit: I've been plastering viy Website I 'HE
in this column for the past three months. At first /
felt bud at the blatant self-promotion. but then /
realized that if CSIO6. ! is going to suck my life
dn of all elements of hope and happiness, I
shouldn't feel ashamed, technology lias turned
me into a mumbling mess, and / now hate it with
a passion.
Also, after an entire volume of writing
columns, / feel like I've gained experience,
wisdom and maturity, lint one thing I still
don't understand is our goddamn readers:
on the days when we f>ut out a column that
we wrote in wretchedly little time — and -was
not, we'd admit, one of our best — we heard
just as many good things as when we pub
lished our best columns, What the hell? Ei
ther we can't judge the quality of our own
•writing (a very real possibility, sob), or you
readers have no taste. Either way. as usual,
we lose.
112 inally, since Eve now essentially dosed
off all hopes of graduating from this godfor
saken place. I just wanted to give a delightful
shout-out to all my professors, past and fu
ture. Even though you may not know liow to
read a clock to see when class should be over,
/ really love your dedication, how yon help me
to understand the material and the excellent,
detailed recommendations that you will write
for me next year. Thanks, professors.
Doug: / just think you are all neat.
It's been fun. It's been entertaining.
We embarrassed ourselves quite a bit.
But we don't regret anything. So when
you see us around campus, smile and
maybe wave. It'll make us feel like the en
tire thing was worth it.
But since none of you will probably
ever do that, all we're left with is bitter
discontent and apathy. And really,
what's more poignant than that?

We thank our readers and the general stupidity
of people fm giving us all of our column topics.
Men: keep up the long battle to get women. Most
likely, you will /ail, but misery loves company, so
carry on http://wune.stanford.edu/~ramit for
hack-issues of all our columns. HAH A did you

cial commentary to repulse our readers,
but never our horribly ugly staff pic -
tures. Those were an accident, but
proved our point: if a picture is worth a
thousand words, then our pictures
spoke volumes for why we never felt the
sweetness of a woman's touch, except for
her backhand.
In any case, there are many topics we
considered covering during out tenure as
I~he Daily staff columnists, but never got
to because of too much work (see, Mom
and Dad?), too much IM and Mario Kart
and the overarching, guiding light of apa
thy. So, ladies and gentlemen, here's what
we once planned on ranting about but
were too lazy to actually write.
• John Taylor is really not that good of a
professor: In our first quarter freshman
year, nearly every upperclassman told us to
take John Taylor's Kcon 1 class. I le's su< h
a great professor," they told us, "and he
even wrote the book!" Yeah, that's delight
ful, but lecturing straight out of your own
Inxjk five days a week, with one of the worst
examples of technology-in the-classroom
ever (let's call long-dead Adam Smith on
the phone, ha ha!) makes us kindlv suggest
that those damn upperclassmen Taylor
apologists never speak again.
• Why don't girls poop?: Really, why?
• The University should change its mas
cot back to the Indians, only the Ramit
kind of Indian: We can all agree that this
is a democratic society. Since the will of this
campus is largely dictated by the majority,
we propose a change: in order to be more
representative, the mascot must revert to
the Indians. The Gates Building, for in
stance, is literally packed with Ph.D. FOBs.
No one can deny that this c ampus has a lot
of Indians! Thus, our proposal is logically

sound; S< m ales would be
proud.
• More women need to
visit our room.
• We need more bel
ligerent drunks: Serious
ly, isn't the risk of a "bel
ligerent" drunk tar out
weighed by the many,
many occasions when

you've pointed and laughed at your stupid
drunk friend? Yes.
So since we have the rest of the column
as free space for whatever we want, we'll be
damned if we're going to waste this oppor
tunity. (>1 anted, toda\ \s rants might smack
of the ramblings of two men who are on
their way out, but we're OK with that.
When it's your last column and there's no
accountability whatsoever, \ou tend to say
whatever the hell you want.
Ramit: I've been plastering viy Website I 'HE
in this column for the past three months. At first /
felt bud at the blatant self-promotion. but then /
realized that if CSIO6. ! is going to suck my life
dn of all elements of hope and happiness, I
shouldn't feel ashamed, technology lias turned
me into a mumbling mess, and / now hate it with
a passion.
Also, after an entire volume of writing
columns, / feel like I've gained experience,
wisdom and maturity, lint one thing I still
don't understand is our goddamn readers:
on the days when we f>ut out a column that
we wrote in wretchedly little time — and -was
not, we'd admit, one of our best — we heard
just as many good things as when we pub
lished our best columns, What the hell? Ei
ther we can't judge the quality of our own
•writing (a very real possibility, sob), or you
readers have no taste. Either way. as usual,
we lose.
112 inally, since Eve now essentially dosed
off all hopes of graduating from this godfor
saken place. I just wanted to give a delightful
shout-out to all my professors, past and fu
ture. Even though you may not know liow to
read a clock to see when class should be over,
/ really love your dedication, how yon help me
to understand the material and the excellent,
detailed recommendations that you will write
for me next year. Thanks, professors.
Doug: / just think you are all neat.
It's been fun. It's been entertaining.
We embarrassed ourselves quite a bit.
But we don't regret anything. So when
you see us around campus, smile and
maybe wave. It'll make us feel like the en
tire thing was worth it.
But since none of you will probably
ever do that, all we're left with is bitter
discontent and apathy. And really,
what's more poignant than that?

We thank our readers and the general stupidity
of people fm giving us all of our column topics.
Men: keep up the long battle to get women. Most
likely, you will /ail, but misery loves company, so
carry on http://wune.stanford.edu/~ramit for
hack-issues of all our columns. HAH A did you
think Ed forget 112
