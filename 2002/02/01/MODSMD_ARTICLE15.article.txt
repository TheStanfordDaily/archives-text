Senior questions 'Cardinal Today' value
I wonder if you could explain your (Car
dinal I odav series.
I think sports are an important part of
life, both for players and spectators. I he)
provide an important ph\ sic al component
of our generally cerebral modern lives.
However, the prevalence of sports in
I he Daily (often two of six pages of non
ad content), as well as in other media, is
much too strong. There are many other
issues that do not get nearh the coverage
they deserve.
Recently you've regularly presented
your newspaper as a full-color sports
paper, with the rest of the Daily as an in
sert. This seems more like satire of
American values than serious news. Are
you serious?

Birth control ad 'condescending' and
'misguided'
While I acknowledge that the views
stated in advertisements are not necessar
ily those of the F.ditorial Staff, etc., I am
nonetheless horrified by the hill page ad
printed on page eight of" Thursday's issue.
The print at the bottom proclaims,"(,on
domscan break and accidents can happen,"
"Kmergency contraception.. .c an keep act i
dents from complicating your life," and
"ACCIDENTS HAPPEN. That's why
there's morning-after contraception." What
are these "accidents," I wonder?
Clearly, "accident" is an epithet for
"pregnancy," which to the ad's sponsors,
apparently, is simply a mishap that some

times follows intercourse to "complicate" a
woman's life. Moreover, the ad explicitly
presumes women to be quite sexually ac
tive ("So many men â€” so many reasons to
have backup contraception") and implicit
ly condones their choice, both through the
pit ture and by flattering the female leafl
et ("()112 course you're using contraception
diligently" [good for you!]).
I find the ad condescending to women
wht) are not sexuall) active and misguided in
its views on the "accident" that is pregnancy.

Israeli-Ardb conflict response
I write- to correct the many mistakes in
Yonatan (Hitman's letter.
1. Cutman states that most Palestini
ans living in Israel / Palestine today ar
rived in the last 150 years. This is not
true. Palestinians have lived in this area
for close to two thousand years. I assume
that Cut man gets his facts from Joan Pe
ters s book "From Time Immemorial,"
which has been soundly debunked by
scholars since its publication. Further
more, the- Palestinians' long and uninter
rupted presence in Israel / Palestine,
along with their innocence in expelling
Jews from this territory in the first place,
certainly gives them as much of claim to
the land as it does the Jews.
2. Cutman states says Zionist organiza
tions "bought back large portions of what
is know as pre-19fi7 Israel." Again, not
true. Zionists "bought back," at most, six
percent of the land.
3. Contrary to (iutman's assertions,

Arabs who are Israeli citizens are not treat
ed as equals; rather, their status is akin, al
though not directly parallel, to that of
blacks in America prior to the Civil Rights
Movement. For instance Palestinians usu
ally receive 50 percent less funding for
local government budgets and have less
resources allocated for welfare budgets
and educational programs. Examples of
Israel s unequal treatment of its Arab and
Jewish citizens abound.
4. By stating that Arabs started the
19(>7 War, (iutman is drawing a portrait
of Israel as an innocent nation besieged
by hostile Arab neighbors. But as Avi
Shlaitn chronicles in his book "The Iron
\\ all, Israel often rejected peace propos
als fiom its Arab neighbors and goaded
them into armed conflicts in order to de
pict itself as t he victim and its Arab neigh
bors as aggressors.
For anyone who wants to better edu
cate themself about the Palestinian / Is
raeli conflict, I suggest they read the works
of Simha Flappen, Avi Shlaim, Ilan Pape,
lorn Segev and Benny Morris. All are Is
raeli Jews and respected scholars who
have chronicled how Israel brutally and
unfairly dispossessed Palestinians of their
land, continues to oppress them and re
jected peace with its Arab neighbors.
