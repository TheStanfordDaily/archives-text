# Kidnappers postpone killing Pearl

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) —A group claiming
to hold kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter
1 )aniel Pearl extended the deadline for killing him by
one day in an e-mail sent yesterday and warned his
abduction is just the beginning.
In Washington, Secretary of State Colin Powell
said "we are doing everything we can" to win Pearl's
release, but ruled out bending to demands made in
previous e-mails for the return of prisoners from the
Afghan campaign.
It was impossible to determine whether yester
day's unsigned e-mail, received by Western and Pak
istani media, was actually sent by the kidnappers,
who abducted the 38-year-old Pearl on Jan. 23 in
Karachi. However, Pakistani sources close to the in
vestigation, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said police believe it did.
"We will give you one more day. If America will
not meet our demands, we will kill Daniel. Then this
cycle will continue and no American journalist could
enter Pakistan," the message said.
It warned that unless the demands are met, "the
Amrikans (Americans) will get what they deserve.
Don't think this is will be the end. It is the beginning
and it is a real war on Amrikans."
"Amrikans will get the taste of death and destruc
tions what we had got" in Afghanistan and Pakistan,
the e-mail said.
An e-mail over the weekend — the first from
those claiming to hold Pear — demanded Pakistanis
captured in fighting in Afghanistan and now held by
the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, be re

turned to Pakistan for trial. It said Pearl would be
held in the same "inhuman" conditions as the (luan
tanamo prisoners.
An unsigned e-mail Wednesday set a 24-hour
deadline before Pearl would bt* killed, accusing him
of working for the Israeli intelligence agency, the
Mossad. It also demanded all American journalists
leave Pakistan within three days or become targets.
The latest message gave no reason for the exten
sion and did not specify at what time the count
down began.
The Pakistani sources said the latest e-mail was
sent through the same server as the one received
Wednesday. Yesterday's message did not include
photographs of Pearl, as the e-mails Wednesday
and Sunday did, but the sources said police are op
erating on the assumption that all three came from
the kidnappers. They cited similarities in language
and spelling.
Police claim they are pursuing several leads
but have refused to give details. Yesterday, a
source close to the investigation, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said a key suspect
known only as Aril was reported dead in south
ern Punjab province.
Powell told reporters that he had spoken with
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, "and I know
that he is doing everything he can."
But Powell ruled out any negotiations with the
kidnappers. "The demands that the kidnappers
have placed are not demands that we can either deal
with or get into a negotiation about," he said.
