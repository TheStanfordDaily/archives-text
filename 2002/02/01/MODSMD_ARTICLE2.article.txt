# Sand Hill Rd. widening remains unclear
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Menlo Park Mayor Steve
Schmidt has indicated that he may
favor widening a three-block
stretch of Sand llill Road adjacent
to Stanford property. This an
nouncement demonstrates a sub
stantial shift in his stance, because
for five years Menlo Park leaders
have actively fought Stanford's at
tempts to make litis change.
1 lowever, Schmidt's reconsider
ation does not necessarily represent
the views of the Menlo Park City
Council, which still must approve
the change for it to occur.
Stanford has been trying to get
support to widen Sand Hill Road
from two lanes to four from the
Santa Cru/ intersection to F.I
Camino Real.

Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
at Stanford, said this stretch has
been identified as "one of the silliest
traffic jams" in the area, and noted
that hired traffic experts and the
general public believe that a
change is needed.
However, Menlo Park City
(Council member Mary Jo Borak
said real improvement would re
quire far more comprehensive
changes than those Stanford (in
tently supports.
"If you really want to fix that in
tersect ion and have it takea lot more
traffic, it needs a quadruple bypass,"
Borak said, asserting that changing
the road to four lanes "is not going
to make much of a difference."
Stanford's main concern is mak
ing the Medical (.enter more a< t es
sible, I lorton said.

"In the long run, it is in Stan
ford's interest to see the transporta
tion corridor that serves the Med
ical ('.enter to be a good one," he
continued.
According to Morton. Stan lord
put lorth a proposal in 1997 to pa\
100 percent of the cost of widening
Sand 1 lill Road and also to pa\ lor
needed improvements at the inter
sections of Junipero Sen a Boule
vard and Alpine Road and ol Sand
I lill Road and Santa ( ruz Avenue.
"There are actual drawings of
actual improvements approved In
the city of Palo Alto," he said.
According to 1 lorton, this offer
good until Dec. 81, 2007, hut il
Menlo Park does not accept it l>\
that date, then the financial burden
of any improvements will fall en
tirely on its shoulders.
"Stanford has the offer out, and

we'd like to see it done," Horton
said. "But ultimately, Menlo Park
is sovereign."
Until Schmidt's recent indica
tion that he may be willing to nego
tiate, Menlo Park leaders had not
made any strong moves toward ac
cepting the proposal.
Borak, c iting the immense com
plexity of the traffic issues sur
rounding these areas, said that the
improvements suggested in Stan
lord's proposal were not adequate.
She characterized the propos
al as "just widening Sand Hill
Road and making some very di
rect quote-end-quote improve
ments at the Sand Hill-Santa
(.111/ intersection."

Despite controversy, Menlo Park Mayor Steve Schmidt said that he may
favor widening Sand Hill Road â€” a major shift from Menlo Park's tradition
al opposition of Stanford's attempts to make this change.
I fill Road intersection are "cheek to
jaw," said Borak, and because of
their proximity must be studied to
gether in order to conceive effec
tive changes.
According to Borak, Stanford
refused to study "the Junipero
Sena-Alpine and Santa (-ritz inter
section" and did not propose any
improvements to the Junipero
Serra-Alpine intersection in the
1997 plan.
"Stanford absolutely refused to
study it," she said. "The offer that
they made in 1997 for $10 million
didn't include any of that, and 1
think because to really fix that in
tersection would be a very expen
sive thing."
However, Morton maintained
that the proposed changes were
constructive.
"I continue to disagree with
some of the allegations that have
been made with the effectiveness of
the road changes," he said.
Reached at his home, Schmidt
declined an interview with The
Daily. But he told the San Jose

Mercury News that if Stanford
were willing to make several con
cessions, he may be willing to
support the changes.
I he Mercury News reported
that the four members of Menlo
Park's City Council, including
Borak, did not yet have a set stance
on Schmidt's shilt.
Horton indicated that one
issue slowing potential progress
was Schmidt's suggestion that al
terations be made to the
planned changes for the Sand
Hill Road and Santa Cruz Av
enue intersection.
"[Schmidt] said 1 he next move
is for Stanford to redesign the in
tersection," he said. "But we
need to work on this together.
We're not willing to simply re
draw a new design and plop it
down and have it rejected again."
I lorton added, "We want to be
responsive to the mayor of Menlo
Park, but we don't think the ball is
in our court."
Both Horton and Menlo Park
council members said they are
willing to work together to
achieve a solution to the existing
tralfic problems.
"We want to be responsive and
constructive," 1 lorton said.
