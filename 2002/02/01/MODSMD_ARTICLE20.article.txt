### AARON LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's no way to describe
Casey Jacobsen's 49-point per
formance Thursday night.
Spectacular. 1 nspiring.
Clutch.
It all falls short.
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery even tried to describe it.
"Phenomenal," he said.
Still short.

Thursday: No. 18 Stanford
90, ASUBI.

"It was just a heck of a perfor
mance," Montgomery said after
the Cardinal's 90-81 victory over
Arizona State. "I've never seen a
performance like that. He was
feeling the ball and shooting it,
but we needed every part of it."
Did they ever.
In fact, Stanford trailed by five
points in the first half, and it
should have been more.
But Jacobsen scored 18 and
kept it close.
The Cardinal then trailed by
as much as nine in the second
half.
But Jacobsen scored ill and
led the team to victory.
Essentially, Jacobsen single
handedly helped the Cardinal

that shot 55 percent from the
field and, according to Mont
gomery, deserved to win the
game.
"They surprised us with how
good they were. They were read)
to play tonight," Montgomery
said. "Give credit where credit is
due — they were good.
Jacobsen, however, was better.
I le made shots from the left and
he made shots from the right. 1 le
had the crowd in awe and the
Sixth Man on their toes. I le con
verted seven straight attempts in
the second half, the last of which
gave Stanford a 77-71 lead.
People talk about the "/one."
Jacobsen was in it.l hree-point
ers. Baseline jumpers. Runners.
Floaters. You name it, he hit it.
"I've had games where the
hoop seems like the ocean," said
jacobsen. "I'd been working
hard anil waiting fora game like
this. I figured I was due."
Was he ever.
Despite a 2-for-6 start, Jacob
sen never wavered and kept ask
ing for the ball, pointing to him
self every time down the court.
"From the first five minutes I
got looks, and I was being ag
gressive," Jacobsen said. "My
shot felt good. I had a feeling
then that 1 could get more.
