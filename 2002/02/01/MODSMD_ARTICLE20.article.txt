## Jacobsen lifts Card over Sun Devils 
### AARON LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's no way to describe
Casey Jacobsen's 49-point per
formance Thursday night.
Spectacular. 1 nspiring.
Clutch.
It all falls short.
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery even tried to describe it.
"Phenomenal," he said.
Still short.

"It was just a heck of a perfor
mance," Montgomery said after
the Cardinal's 90-81 victory over
Arizona State. "I've never seen a
performance like that. He was
feeling the ball and shooting it,
but we needed every part of it."

In fact, Stanford trailed by five
points in the first half, and it
should have been more.
But Jacobsen scored 18 and
kept it close.
The Cardinal then trailed by
as much as nine in the second
half.
But Jacobsen scored ill and

"They surprised us with how

said. "Give credit where credit is

Last night Junior Casey Jacobsen recorded the most points in collegiate bas
ketball this season with 49. Jacobsen led the Cardinal to a 90-81 victory over
the Arizona State Sun Devils at Maples Pavilion.
"I was looking to shoot the ball
every time 1 touched it. Not only was
it coming ofl'my hand perfectly, I
was seeing the play five seconds Ix--
forehand. I hat hasn't happened.
W hen it docs happen, you've got to
ride it as long as you can."
Jacobsen said he had three 50-
point games when he played at
(ilendora I ligli S< hool, and he also
nailed II It-pointers in one game.
But nothing compared to this.
"It was the case of a great player
having a great game,' Sun Devils
coach Rob Kvans said. "That's
what big time players do, and
that's why he's an All-American."
The records Jacobsen set tell
the story:
I lis 40 points was a Maples
Pavilion record and was the sec
ond-most points ever scored at
Stanford (Hank Luisetti, 50 in
1938).
It was the highest individual
point total in college basketball this
season
It was the best single-player
performance in history against the
Sun Devils.

It was the first time a Stan lord
player had stored 40 points since
Kimberly Helton scored 41 in 1980.
It was the most at Maples since
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire in
1995 w hen he stored 45.
It was the most hy a Stanford
player since Ron formic w hen he
scored 45 in the 1955 season.
And it was the sixth-best single
game performance in league histo
ry (Lou Alcindor, Kddie House
had ()l).
Simply put, this was the game
|acobsen had waited to have lot
the past three years.
And this was the game every
body had been waiting to see.
So what was the difference?
"I had a different mindset," Ja
cobsen said. "I was more relaxed
before the game than I can re
member and especially better than
any game this year. I wasn't think
ing about the game four hours be
fore it started. I was a normal per
son. just hanging out."
Maybe he should hang out
some more.
The vic tory kept the Cardinal
(13-5, 6-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
1.5 games back of Southern Cali
fornia and Oregon in the confer
ence race. Basically, it was a
must-win.

()l course, Jacobsen has had
solid games so lar this season. He
scored 32 against Oregon and 28
against BYU. Bui both were in
losses.
"Tonight I can smile," (acobsen
said. "It's appropriate, because we
won the game.
"We needed this game so bad."

Last night Junior Casey Jacobsen recorded the most points in collegiate bas
ketball this season with 49. Jacobsen led the Cardinal to a 90-81 victory over
the Arizona State Sun Devils at Maples Pavilion.
"I was looking to shoot the ball
every time 1 touched it. Not only was
it coming ofl'my hand perfectly, I
was seeing the play five seconds Ix--
forehand. I hat hasn't happened.
W hen it docs happen, you've got to
ride it as long as you can."
Jacobsen said he had three 50-
point games when he played at
(ilendora I ligli S< hool, and he also
nailed II It-pointers in one game.
But nothing compared to this.
"It was the case of a great player
having a great game,' Sun Devils
coach Rob Kvans said. "That's
what big time players do, and
that's why he's an All-American."
The records Jacobsen set tell
the story:
I lis 40 points was a Maples
Pavilion record and was the sec
ond-most points ever scored at
Stanford (Hank Luisetti, 50 in
1938).
It was the highest individual
point total in college basketball this
season
It was the best single-player
performance in history against the
Sun Devils.

It was the first time a Stan lord
player had stored 40 points since
Kimberly Helton scored 41 in 1980.
It was the most at Maples since
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire in
1995 w hen he stored 45.
It was the most hy a Stanford
player since Ron formic w hen he
scored 45 in the 1955 season.
And it was the sixth-best single
game performance in league histo
ry (Lou Alcindor, Kddie House
had ()l).
Simply put, this was the game
|acobsen had waited to have lot
the past three years.
And this was the game every
body had been waiting to see.
So what was the difference?
"I had a different mindset," Ja
cobsen said. "I was more relaxed
before the game than I can re
member and especially better than
any game this year. I wasn't think
ing about the game four hours be
fore it started. I was a normal per
son. just hanging out."
Maybe he should hang out
some more.
The vic tory kept the Cardinal
(13-5, 6-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
1.5 games back of Southern Cali
fornia and Oregon in the confer
ence race. Basically, it was a
must-win.

()l course, Jacobsen has had

scored 32 against Oregon and 28
