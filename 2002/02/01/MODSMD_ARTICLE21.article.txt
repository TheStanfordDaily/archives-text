# Surprises keep Pac-10 guessing
## 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
As the announcer stated the
other Pacific 10 Conference
scores of the night, no one had a
reaction.
No "oohs,". . . no "awws,". . .
no "boos" — just silence.
"Berkeley leads Arizona by
two at the half," — nothing.
"UCLA's clown by 19 to Ore
gon in Eugene," — not a sound.
I'he disarray in the Pac-10 has
left fans speechless, not knowing
who to cheer for, not knowing
which team's win or loss will best
serve Stanford.
It has been a season chalked
full of mystery thus far.
So it wasn't even shocking
when head coach Mike Mont
gomery decided to make a
change in his starting lineup
three months into the* season.
Ilie shifting starting lineup of the
Cardinal parallels the chaos per
vading this conference.
l*iit simply, no one knows
their place anymore.
Not even the Cardinal players.
Against the Sun Devils, Mont
gomery opted to start sopho
more forward Teyo Johnson.
Johnson replaced sophomore
forward Justin Davis, who has
struggled to find an offensive
spark as of late.
"1 just wanted to change the

scenery tot Justin," Montgomery
said. "I let an be mad at me, that's
fine. I le's a great player, but he's
not playing up to that, 112 le's got to
make the plays that he's capable
of making."
"I assumed that i was going to
start on Monday," Johnson said.
"I was on the first string all week.
I think that [Coach Montgomery]
likes energy out there on the
court and he wants it right away."
Johnson, who got his first start
of the season, began the game a
little anxious. Although the call
was questionable, Johnson
picked up a c harge on his first of
fensive possession of the night
and then two minutes later was
whistled fora foul on the defen
sive end of the court.
I le sat out the final 15 minutes
of the first half.
" l evo does a lot of things well
for us when he's in the game,"
said junior guard Julius Barnes.
"But we still have to get used to
him out there. That will take a lit
tle bit of time. I think Coach just
wanted a little change."
Stanford isn't the only team
going through an identity crisis
this year. Ihe days of certain
teams just being better no longer
exist.
Arizona State takes down Ari
zona?
USC knocks oil UCI A?
California abuses Stanford.?
C )rcgon beats up on everyone?
Thinks just don't seem right in
Pac-10 Land.
No one knows what's going on
and with approximately four
weeks left to play there's no telling
where this thing is going to end up.
Fans are just unshoe kable these
days. Upsets have become main
stay, establishing a weekly ritual of

disappointments and Cinderella
stories.
"It's just the story of this confer
ence," Montgomery said. "There
are a lot of good teams."
And Arizona State is definitely
one of them.
" I'll is was a good win for us,"
Montgomery said. "Cive credit
where credit is due, they were
good. We knew that ASU was
good, but we didn't know that
they were that good. They would
not concede. They would not
give in."
Don't let the 4-6 Sun Devils fool
vou. They've won four the hard

way, beating state rival Arizona
and conference leader Oregon.
They also dropped close games to
both UCLA and USC, losing by a
combined 1 1 points.
And they almost walked into
Maples and shocked the Cardinal.
Ihe Sun Devils jogged off the
court at halftime, leading Stanford
by five.
And if it weren't for the record
breaking heroics of junior Casey
Jacobsen, they just might have
jogged oil the court at the end of
the game, upsetting the Cardinal.
But would that really be sur
prising?
