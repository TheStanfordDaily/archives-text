Last season, the Cardinal sur
prised Fullerton by taking two of
three games on the Titans' home
field. Now, with the tables turned

the same at Sunken Diamond by

each game on the hill, perhaps the
best pitching match-up of the
weekend will be that between the
teams' two closers. Stanford's se
nior J.D. Willcox (5-0, 2.06 ERA in
2001) earned six saves List season
while holding opponents to a pal
try .220 average.

sophomore Chad Cordero (3-4,

Tonight's contest pits Cardinal
junior Jeremy Cuthrie (13-4,
2.82), coming off an outstanding
season as the team's No. I starter,
against Fullerton sophomore VVes
Littleton (2-0, 7.08).
Many expected the 22-year old
Cuthrie to head to professional
ball after being selected in the
third round of Major League

poise on the mound back to the

three games on the Titans' home
field. Now, with the tables turned

each game on the hill, perhaps the
best pitching match-up of the
weekend will be that between the
teams' two closers. Stanford's se

2001) earned six saves List season
while holding opponents to a pal
try .220 average.

junior Jeremy Cuthrie (13-4,
