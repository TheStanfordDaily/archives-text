Here they come.
The sixteen members and three
coaches of the No. Stanford soft
ball team are more than eager to
kick off their season at home to
morrow, Saturday Feb. 2, against
Santa Clara.

Saturday: Stanford vs. Santa

"It is really exciting to start com
peting," junior Dana Sorensen
said. "January is very long because
it is one last month of practicing
before the season begins. We are
going to go out there and play
Santa Clara like it is UCLA or Ari
zona because we haven't seen any
competition. It is going to be fun
for us."
The Cardinal's double-header
this weekend against the Broncos
is the beginning of a long and hard
fought 65 game journey. The team
begins this journey right here on
the Farm, and then continues to
travel around the country for its
next 20 games.
Stanford looks at this prc-con
ference play as an integral part of
its season.
"I think it is a good place to start
out." Sorensen said. "Santa Clara

is a good opponent and they will be
competition for us. I hey serve as a
great building step, you don't want
to just jump into the deep end
right away. Our pre-c onference
season is very important as prepa
ration for the Pat-10."
But, the Cardinal is not taking
the Broncos lightly.
"I think that we are going to
have to try and stav intense fora

full 14 innings," junior Fori Ny
berg said. "We need to keep in
mind thai Santa Clara is going to
be even tougher this year. I here
are going to be two competitive
games."

Senior Robin Walker and the No. 3 women's softball team established themselves last year as national contenders.
This season a championship is in their sights. The team will open Saturday with a game against Santa Clara.
Stanford pitchers threw to Santa
(-lara, allowing only a single Bron
co to cross the plate in 12 innings of
play. |uniors Sorensen, Maureen
LeCocq and Nyberg will attempt
to quell the bats of the visiting
squad once again.
"1 try to lake the same approach
into every game," LeCocq said. "I
always trv to think that I am fin ing
the best pitchers there are. Santa
Clara has some great players and
they are going to be tough. But, I
am just going t<> throw the pitches
that are working lor me and be
confident that I have my defense
behind me."
Leading the Broncos in the

circle will be senior Deanna Ro
driguez who finished last season
breaking the Santa Clara career
record for strikeouts with 290
and posting seven shutouts. Ro
driguez and the rest of the
Broncos pitching staff will work
to try and keep the Cardinal of
fense silent.
Stanford is hoping that their
bats will be as hot as they were last
year squaring off against the
Broncos.
In the Cardinal-Santa Clara
face-oil last season the entire line
up contributed. The Stanford bats
produced 15 runs in 12 innings in
cluding break out performances
by last year's freshmen — sopho
mores Jessica Allister and Michelle
I liirv. Allister walked away with a
RBI double and I hiry posted her
first collegiate homerun.

Stanford looks forward to see
ing what this year's freshmen are
capable of.
"We will see who is going to step
up," head coach John Rittman
said. "We have some positions that
are still open, and we will have a
chance to see who is going to fill
those spots this season."
The Cardinal is excited to get
some action this weekend, and
prove what they can do at home in
the Boyd & Jill Smith Family Sta
dium. But, Stanford does realize
that being the No. team in the na
tion comes with a whole new set of
expectations. The Cardinal is
going to take the field tomorrow
with the knowledge that it is the
team to beat.
"We know this year that we are
the ones with the targets on our
backs," Rittman said.

"It is really exciting to start com
peting," junior Dana Sorensen
said. "January is very long because
it is one last month of practicing
before the season begins. We are
going to go out there and play
Santa Clara like it is UCLA or Ari
zona because we haven't seen any
competition. It is going to be fun
for us."
The Cardinal's double-header
this weekend against the Broncos
is the beginning of a long and hard
fought 65 game journey. The team
begins this journey right here on
the Farm, and then continues to
travel around the country for its
next 20 games.
Stanford looks at this prc-con
ference play as an integral part of
its season.
"I think it is a good place to start
out." Sorensen said. "Santa Clara

is a good opponent and they will be
competition for us. I hey serve as a
great building step, you don't want
to just jump into the deep end
right away. Our pre-c onference
season is very important as prepa
ration for the Pat-10."
But, the Cardinal is not taking
the Broncos lightly.
"I think that we are going to
have to try and stav intense fora

full 14 innings," junior Fori Ny
berg said. "We need to keep in
mind thai Santa Clara is going to
be even tougher this year. I here
are going to be two competitive
games."
