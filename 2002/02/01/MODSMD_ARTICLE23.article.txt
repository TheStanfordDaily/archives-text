"It is really exciting to start com
peting," junior Dana Sorensen
said. "January is very long because
it is one last month of practicing
before the season begins. We are
going to go out there and play
Santa Clara like it is UCLA or Ari
zona because we haven't seen any
competition. It is going to be fun
for us."
The Cardinal's double-header
this weekend against the Broncos
is the beginning of a long and hard
fought 65 game journey. The team
begins this journey right here on
the Farm, and then continues to
travel around the country for its
next 20 games.
Stanford looks at this prc-con
ference play as an integral part of
its season.
"I think it is a good place to start
out." Sorensen said. "Santa Clara

is a good opponent and they will be
competition for us. I hey serve as a
great building step, you don't want
to just jump into the deep end
right away. Our pre-c onference
season is very important as prepa
ration for the Pat-10."
But, the Cardinal is not taking
the Broncos lightly.
"I think that we are going to
have to try and stav intense fora

full 14 innings," junior Fori Ny
berg said. "We need to keep in
mind thai Santa Clara is going to
be even tougher this year. I here
are going to be two competitive
games."
