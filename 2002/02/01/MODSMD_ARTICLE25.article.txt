success and strong leadership
under Coach Richard Quick and
co-captains Ripple and Jessica
Foschi have infused the close-knit
team with excitement and hope,
particularly for the upcoming
Pat-10 .md NCAA championship
meets.
Foschi remains unbeaten in the
l,()50-yard freestyle, and Ripple
remains unbeaten in the 200-yarcl
butterfly this season. Sophomore
Tara Kirk remains undefeated in
lu-i career in the 100-yard breast,
with her Kith-straight vic tory com
ing last weekend against Arizona
State.
"I think the season is going
great so far." Ripple said. "I lowev

er, all of our eyes are set on March;
I believe something special is going
to happen at the NCAA's. I have
never had so much confidence in a
team."
I he Bruins are 2-2 in Pac-10
meets. I he\ boast strong freestyle
sprinters in sophomore Sara
Platzer and freshman Mai in
Svahnstrom, who won a bronze
medal at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney.
1 he major focus for the week
end, however, is the meet against
USC (4-1) at the McDonald's Swim
Stadium. Despite recent losses to
Arizona and Arizona State, USC
has come back in three non-con
ference meets with victories
against UC-Santa Barbara, Pacific
and UC-Irvine.
The I rojans are very strong in
the individual medley and butter
fly and will provide good competi
tion for Stanford in both swim
ming and diving.
Indeed, the Stanford divers
have contributed heavily to meet
successes this season, and they ex

pect no less this weekend.
"UCLA divers are not on the
same level as Stanford," head div
ing coach Rick Schavone said.
"However, anything can happen
in a six dive dual meet, so they
could — hut should not — beat
us."
Although Stanford has been
particularly strong this year in
one-meter diving, Saturday's meet
against USC will not be easy. USC
freshman Blythe Hartley and
sophomore Nicci Fusaro are
among the lop divers in the* nation,
outscoring Stanford divers at the
Bruin Diving Invitational on Jan.
18-19 and the Trojan Diving In
vite on Nov. 8-11.
Still, with their impressive
record, the outlook is good for the
Cardinal swimmers and divers.
I'ac-lOs, which will be held in Long
Beach this year, are just four weeks
away. The NCAA Championships,
hosted by Texas, are just seven
weeks away.
To prepare, training is getting
much more specific. The team is

going lor bigger and more solid
wins as they build up to the final
meetings.
Indeed, the coaches and swim
mers expect very fast times out ol
this weekend.
"We are still training very
hard, but we are trying to convert
all of the hard work into great

performances," lose hi said. " 1 lie
team has great chemistry and,
from top to bottom, everyone is
improving. Our season lias been
terrific so far, and we are confi
dent about our end-of-the-season
goals. This weekend is just one
more step towards where we want
to be in March."

Sophomore Tara Kirk has been instrumental in Stanford's undefeated start to
the season. This weekend she will look to remain undefeated in her collegiate
career performance of the 100-yard breaststroke. The women's team will
face No. 11 UCLA and No. 10 USC this weekend in Los Angeles.
