# Board delays trail ruling
## 
### MICHAEL ENDLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Already one of the most fiercely debat
ed issues fac ing Stanford, the dispute over
two trails the University must dedicate in
the Foothills under the General Use Per
mit took a new turn Tuesday, when the
Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors
postponed until August a decision on the
trails' alignment.
The controversy over the two routes
began shortly after the GUP was signed in
December 2000. An agreement between
Stanford and Santa Clara County, the
GUP says that the University must, in
order to develop land for academic build
ings and housing units over the next 10
years, dedicate and develop the two trails,
labeled CI and SI.
Initially, Stanford's routes were ap
proved. but these paths quickly came
under fire. Community members raised
questions as to whether or not the CI trail
could snake across county lines, while en
vironmental groups became vocal about
the proximity of the SI path to Interstate
280 and to a series of creeks inhabited by
the endangered red-legged frog.
"What |the University] is proposing is
completely insensitive to [wildlife habi
tats]," said Denice Dade of the Committee
for Green Foothills."
Of the new decision, Dade said, "We
want to see compliance with the GUP, and
we would like a timely implementation.
Fhe fact that there has been no resolution
yet is disappointing. We're hoping, how
ever, that the methodical proceedings can

find a path that is environmentally accept
able and acceptable to the county."
Various groups have proposed new
routes for SI and CI, which, as currently
proposed, follow Page Mill Road on the
southeast side of campus and Alpine Road
on Stanford's north side respectively. I lie
alternate paths, however, cut far deeper
into the campus than any that were initial
ly approved.
"The trails are permanent," said Uarrv
Morton, Stanford's director of govern
ment and community relations. "We don't
want the future Board of Trustees and fu
ture students restricted because of trail
dedications today. Leland and Jane Stan
lord endowed this land, and it cannot be
sold for the University."
"We will never agree to such deeply in
vasive trails," Morton said. "We agreed to
peripheral ones."
Provost John Etc hemendy echoed I lor
ton's sentiment.
" Fhe University is private land, and it is
our responsibility and purpose to use the
land for educational and research purpos
es as much as possible," he said.
Morton points out that Stanford al
ready runs many programs that benefit
the public and receive outside approval,
such as the Jasper Ridge Biologic al Re
serve and the Dish. Me likens the alter
nate trail proposals to someone who re
quests to run a pipe along the edge of a
neighbor's fence.

Less invasive alternate routes
have proven in feasible because of
the physical terrain. 1 he "cherry
stem" proposal, which called for
running the trail along a stretch
of Stanford connecting two
pieces of Palo Alto, had seemed
possible until, Morton said, "(it
was realized] that a vast ravine
and many trees" would have to be
eliminated.
One of the new SI proposals
under consideration, which will
be ruled on in August, involves
creating a much desired path that
would connect to a ('.all rans tun

cerns and is "technically feasible,'
according to I lot ton.
Opposition from local neigh
borhoods looks to be the biggest
impediment to this plan, al

the county, "Stanford is prepared
to work diligently ... to obtain
approval."
Two other proposals are also
being considered, and the Uni
versity is prepared to comply
with them if Santa Clara County
so prefers.

"The trails are permanent," said Uarrv
Morton, Stanford's director of govern
ment and community relations. "We don't
want the future Board of Trustees and fu
ture students restricted because of trail
dedications today. Leland and Jane Stan
lord endowed this land, and it cannot be
sold for the University."
"We will never agree to such deeply in
vasive trails," Morton said. "We agreed to
peripheral ones."
Provost John Etc hemendy echoed I lor
ton's sentiment.
" Fhe University is private land, and it is
our responsibility and purpose to use the
land for educational and research purpos
es as much as possible," he said.
Morton points out that Stanford al

the public and receive outside approval,
such as the Jasper Ridge Biologic al Re

Less invasive alternate routes
have proven in feasible because of
the physical terrain. 1 he "cherry
stem" proposal, which called for
running the trail along a stretch
of Stanford connecting two
pieces of Palo Alto, had seemed
possible until, Morton said, "(it
was realized] that a vast ravine
and many trees" would have to be
eliminated.
One of the new SI proposals
under consideration, which will
be ruled on in August, involves
creating a much desired path that
would connect to a ('.all rans tun

route avoids environmental con

according to I lot ton.
Opposition from local neigh
borhoods looks to be the biggest
impediment to this plan, al
though I lortcn said in a memo to
the county, "Stanford is prepared
to work diligently ... to obtain
approval."
Two other proposals are also
being considered, and the Uni
versity is prepared to comply
with them if Santa Clara County
so prefers.
Until August, both the Uni
