# Police increase bike rule enforcement
## 
### ELLIE RITCH STAFF WRITER 
In the past week, Stanford students
have taken note of an escalation in hike
rule enforcement hy (lie Stanford Police.
Senior Kinily Williams was forced to
notice the change, when she was stopped
l>\ a policeman while hiking through the
intersection of Santa Teresa Street and
Lomita Drive.
"1 got a verbal warning for not stop
ping at the stop sign on Santa Teresa last
Monday," she said.
Some Stanford hikers seem content to

adopt a survival-of-the-littest attitude re
garding who escapes the Farm un
scathed hy a hike ac c ident. Williams said
she finds it unnecessary and ridiculous
for police to ticket speech hikers at cam
pus intersections.
"The police should go find some real
crimes and let Darwin's law take care of ns
bikers," Williams said.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Moore
disagrees. According to Moore, the re
cent rise in hike ticketing is rooted in the
department's desire to enforce a philoso
phy of campus safety, not just the letter of
the law.

"There has been a recent increase in
minor bicycle accidents, but there has also
been a significant increase in the amount
of complaints of reckless biking from dri
vers and pedestrians," Moore said.
Currently, authorities focus on two
goals: educating bikers on bike rules and
safety and ensuring that all campus bikers
have proper equipment and registration.
Lieutenant Laura Wilson explained
that reckless biking has been a serious
issue on campus for years
"The community is very aware of
problems that poor cycling etiquette is
creating," Wilson said.
Wilson explained that an effort has
been made by the police to target histori
cally dangerous intersections on campus,
including Campus Drive and Escondido
Road; Campus Drive and Serra Street;
and Lomita Drive and Mayfield Avenue.
The last location tops the charts in the
number of serious accidents per year.
"We would like to focus on warnings,
but warnings just don't have the same im
pact as citations." Wilson said.
In regards to the large number of bicy
clists pulled over at the Santa Teresa
Street and Lomita Drive intersection
around lunchtime last week, Wilson and
Moore stressed that the focus was on edu
cating bikers to use caution.
Police officials said they are aiming to
alert bike users who have little or no re
gard for pedestrian and vehicle traffic at
intersections.
"Do we expect all bicyclists to come to a
complete stop at a stop sign?" Moore
asked. "No! We just want them to use cau
tion and slow down."

In past weeks, Stanford police have increased bike rule enforcement, upping the number
of tickets and verbal warnings given to bicyclists who disobey traffic laws. Police Chief
Marvin Moore attributes this rise to the department's effort to enforce a safety philosophy.
