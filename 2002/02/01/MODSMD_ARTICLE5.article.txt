Editors Note: This is the final installment of The Daily's
three-part series examining the freshman humanities re
quirement, cunently the Introduction to the Humanities pro
gram. Today, we explore the future oflHl M, which goes up
for rei'iew next year. Tomonow, Hie Daily will explore the
future of the program.

A number of students dissatisfied with the HUM
curriculum have taken steps toward changing the
program, 112 rom setting up their own review to design
ing their own courses.
()ne student group, the Freedom Forum, has chal
lenged the administration's claim that MUM is a suc
cess.
"If success is defined as a relative lack of conflict
among faculty members and acceptance by students,
then IHI M is definitely an improvement over (the
Cultures, Ideas and Values program]," said the
groups president, senior Josh 1 lawley. "Rut if success
is defined as how well students are being introduced

to the humanities
then we might have
a ways to go."
I'he Freedom
Forum commission
will conduct its own

review of 1111 M and make recommendations to the
University by the end of this vear. Hawley said the
group is in favor of returning to a core reading list, as
there were in IHtJM's predecessors.
I lie commission will also study similar programsat
comparable universities, espec i.ill\ Columbia's multi
year requirement, whk li is ancliored by a core lead
ing list.
Officials deem canon unrealistic, impractical
According to HUM Program Director Rob
Robinson most students at Stanford are not in favor
of a core reading list.
"Were we to reintroduce a core reading list, the
overall student happiness with Area One would go
down." he said.
Cheri Ross, the program's associate director,
added, "If they are called the Freedom Forum, the
fact that they are moving toward reinstituting a
c anon, which is what I understand they have in mind,
seems antithetic al."
