# Students hope to reform IHUM
## Despite the administration's confidence in Area One, some students still look to modify the curriculum 
### KATRINA SOSTEK SPECIAL CONTRIBUTOR 
Editors Note: This is the final installment of The Daily's
three-part series examining the freshman humanities re
quirement, cunently the Introduction to the Humanities pro
gram. Today, we explore the future oflHl M, which goes up
for rei'iew next year. Tomonow, Hie Daily will explore the
future of the program.

A number of students dissatisfied with the HUM
curriculum have taken steps toward changing the
program, 112 rom setting up their own review to design
ing their own courses.
()ne student group, the Freedom Forum, has chal
lenged the administration's claim that MUM is a suc
cess.
"If success is defined as a relative lack of conflict
among faculty members and acceptance by students,
then IHI M is definitely an improvement over (the
Cultures, Ideas and Values program]," said the
groups president, senior Josh 1 lawley. "Rut if success
is defined as how well students are being introduced

to the humanities
then we might have
a ways to go."
I'he Freedom
Forum commission
will conduct its own

review of 1111 M and make recommendations to the
University by the end of this vear. Hawley said the
group is in favor of returning to a core reading list, as
there were in IHtJM's predecessors.
I lie commission will also study similar programsat
comparable universities, espec i.ill\ Columbia's multi
year requirement, whk li is ancliored by a core lead
ing list.
Officials deem canon unrealistic, impractical
According to HUM Program Director Rob
Robinson most students at Stanford are not in favor
of a core reading list.
"Were we to reintroduce a core reading list, the
overall student happiness with Area One would go
down." he said.
Cheri Ross, the program's associate director,
added, "If they are called the Freedom Forum, the
fact that they are moving toward reinstituting a
c anon, which is what I understand they have in mind,
seems antithetic al."

A set reading list would make
the course less engaging for stu
dents and professors alike, ac
cording to Asst. Prof, of French it-
Italian Joshua Landy, who teaches
II lUM's"'The Art of Living" in the
fall and "Great Works" in the
spring respectively.
In IHUM classes, "there is this
shared passion that is just intoxi
cating," Landy said. "I don't
know if we could get students as
excited about a course that was
about the canon."
Former University President
Gerhard Casper explained the
original move away from the core
reading list of the Western (lulture
and CIV programs.
"We thought the traditional no
tion that all students ideally should
share the same texts throughout
their 112 reshman year was totally un
achievable," he said. "You could
not get the quality of instruction
that you wanted if you forced fac
ulty to do certain things they were
either not equipped for or simply
had no taste for whatsoever."
Another practical, problem
with a core reading list is actually
deciding which works should be
included.
" The core list, were it to make it
that far, could result in bloodlet
ting in the Faculty Senate," Robin
son said. "1 don't want to go that
far, but it would be very hard to get

through a core list."
Casper added, "The debate
about what should be in the canon
will goon ad infinitum and ad nau
seutn and therefore is not worth it,
as far as I'm concerned."
Students initiate IHUM courses
The other side to this decades
old debate is just how much out
side-the-canon-material should be
included in a freshman humanities
course. While I lawley wants to re
turn to a core reading list, others
would like to see the program go in
the opposite direction.
Freshman Michael Brown 11, a
core member of the Black Student
Union, said he would like to see
the program include more minor
ity and female authors.
"[The program] could go a lot
further than [it has] gone," he
said. "I know [program officials]
have said that they are trying, but
if they think IHUM is important
for us and if they think diversity
is important, then they shouldn't
rest."
On Feb. 9, Brown and the BSU
will discuss their- concerns with
IHUM at their Black Liberation
Month conference. He has spoken
with Ross, who said that if they
propose a course, it will have the
support of the IHUM Governance
Board â€” a panel of faculty, ad
ministrators and students who
oversee IHUM.
"Right now the idea is to design a
course," Brown said. "If it can be
done next year, that would be great,
but I know how hard it will be."

Senior Luke Swart/., who sits on
the Governance Board, knows just
how hard it will be for Brown. He
and three other seniors have been
working to implement their own
IHUM course, which they de
signed their freshman year. The
proposed fall quarter course is
called "What is Human?" and the
winter-spring sequence is " 1 lie
Science of (iultureand the ('.ulturc
of Science."
Swartz's course intends to
bridge the gap between the hu
manities and the technical fields.
I'he students developed their
IHUM as a final project fora fresh
man seminar, called "The I wo
Cultures: Bridging the Gap"
taught by English Prof. Ramon
Saldivar and Computer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts of the Comput
er Science Department.
"We are not trying to 'techie-fy'
the HUM courses, but to offer ;i
new perspective," Swart/, said.
He said he plans to submit the
proposal to the IHUM Gover
nance Board by the March dead
line. I le has signed on two Anthro
pological Science professors,
Arthur Wolf and Bill Durham, to
teach the course.
Swart/ has also designed a Web
site for the proposed course that
includes planned syllabi and as
signments.
Core reading list called unlikely
Administrators said they are
less eager to listen to I lawley s rec
ommendations than Swart/s.
"1 think of the idea of educat

ing people so that everyone reads
the same book is a sort of small
college ideal," said Keith Baker,
Cognizant Dean for the Humani
ties. who helped design IHUM.
"The fact of the matter is that the
world isn't like that, the intellec
tual world isn't like that. The
most important problem in intel
lectual life is finding some com
mon ground.'"
Baker said he sees the prospect
of returning to a CIV or Western
Culture lormat as bleak.
"I would be very surprised if we
ended up going back to three
quarters of a common reading
list." he s;iid. "I think the interests
of the students and the interests of
the faculty are just too diverse for
that to happen."
.According to Asst. Philosophy
Prof. \adeem 1 fussain, who teach
es the spring quarter IHUM "Rea
son. Passion and Reality," finding
agreements about the program is
dinicult enough even without a
core reading list.
"One of the explanations Ibr
why the current sy stem is so frag
mented is so that people don't
have to try to agree, because trying
to agree would be so hard." Ilus
sain said. "Now, I'm not saying
that justifies it. I'm just saying that
explains it."
Most other universities have
moved away from core reading
lists. Hie only major university
which still has one is Columbia.
Harvard and Yale have no re
quired humanities courses for
freshman, but instead only a distri

bution requirement.
Stanford stands somewhere be
tween these two extremes, along
with schools such as the I niversity
of Chicago, which was once fa
mous for its core liberal arts cur
riculum but has since loosened its
requirements.
Casper, who used to teach at
Chicago along with Baker, said he
is proud ofStanford's (ompromise
program.
"1 think, other than perhaps
Columbia and some liberal arts
colleges, no institution 1 know of
has managed to impose an identi
cal humanities requirement on all
freshmen that is t.iuglu b\ faculty."
he said.
'The nature of the game'
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall.
who taught " Tradition and Revo
lution" iu the (all and this quarter is
teaching "Power and Passion," lias
been involved with the freshman
requirement courses for years.
McCall came to Stanford in the
late 19705, when there was only a
distribution requirement, chaired
the committee of the Western Cul
ture program from 1982-84,
taught in CIV and now sits on the
IHI'M CovernaiKc Board.
"Any academic program that
gets instituted at any university is
going to be some kind of very
complicated series of compromis
es of everyone's individual ideal
visions of this educational thing
and that educational thing," he
said. "And that's just the nature
of the game."
