# Squirrels invade, enliven Manzanita Park
## Undergraduate Housing Operations struggle to battle squirrel problem 
### HELEN KIM 
When senior Kimball Horsen,
a resident of Kimball Hall, re
turned to campus alter Thanks
giving, he noticed something in
his room was different: " The
power cords behind my stereo
were chewed away."
1 he culprit? Squirrels.
In fact, many residents of Man
zanita Park have experienced
problems with squirrel "intruders"

in their rooms fora while.
Alter years of offering sugges
tions to students 011 how to outwit
squirrels, bugs and other pests,
Undergraduate Housing Opera
tions is finally resorting to a more
permanent solution. New window
screens will be installed in several
dorm complexes around campus,
including Lagunita, Toyon and
Manzanita.
Epson Chiang, a junior who
lived in Kimball last year, remem
bers the trouble his drawmates
had with visiting squirrels.
"A squirrel pooped and peed in
one of my drawmate s beds," he
said. "The squirrels pose a big po
tential for trouble."

One Kimball resident assistant,
senior Erica Grijalva, recalled two
encounters with squirrels.
"1 was sitting at my desk when a
squirrel jumped through my win
dow and onto my desk almost,
brushing its tail in my face," she
said. " The second time I returned
[to my room] and noticed some
paw prints and droppings on my
desk. And some of my papers had
been shredded along their edges."
In the past, Housing officials
pursued different courses to pre
vent squirrels from entering
their rooms.
"We've called pest control
places to remove squirrels from
students' rooms," said Imogen

Church, manager of I ndergradu
ate I lousing (Jperations.
" The pest control people also
talked to students about how to
prevent squirrels from entering
rooms through window sills. [We
also suggested they J purchase
sample screens that opened wide
enough to lit in the window and
snapped in place."
But now, officials have decided
to install permanent screens in
dorms around campus to prevent
pest-related problems.
"Squirrels [and other pests]
are usually attracted to food,"
said Church. "I want to stress
the importance of storing foods
appropriately."


Tech grad schools find boost in applications
By ALI ALEMOZAFAR
The booming economy of the 1990s was
superseded by an unpredictable bust in the
years approaching the end of the millenni
um. Empty office buildings and shattered
hopes mark the remains of the once-effer
vescent dot-com.
In light of the slumping economy, industry
professionals have scrambled to find the best
alternative, and many have opted to go back
to school. Indeed, the Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering Departments at Stan
lord have witnessed a substantial increase in
the number of graduate school applicants.
"The [CS] department has seen a 40 per
cent increase in the number of graduate
school applications for fall 2002 admissions."
said Kathleen Ditommaso, director of com
puter science graduate admissions. In addi
tion to an increase in the number of applica
tions, the department has experienced a yield
increase as well, she said.
Despite the boost in the number of com
puter science graduate school applicants, Dit
ommaso saicl the department does not keep
track of where these individuals come from —
industry or academia — and therefore can
not attribute the boom exclusively to individ
uals from industry.
"People are appreciating more the value of
a good education," said Computer Science
Dept. Chair Hector Carcia-Molina. "We'll
have a better prepared work force."
Across the street, the Department of
Electrical Engineering has experienced a
similar trend.
"We have facts to show that the numbers
of applicants has increased, said Robert
Cray, the department s vice chair. "We ac
cepted about the number we usually do, but
more came."
"In the spring of 2000, students were rush
ing to finish their Ph.D.'s," said Electrical En
gineering Prof. John (.ill, "I was startled to see
the increase in the number ol applications this
year."
Neither department plans to increase the
number of available spots to compensate for
the jump in the number of graduate school
applicants, meaning that admission into both
programs is becoming more competitive.
According to Gill, the large class si/e be
comes apparent around the time of the quali
fying exams.
Aside from examinations, the larger num
bers of students in the more popular classes is
another indication of an increase in the num
ber of graduate students.
Students in both programs confirmed the
heightened demand for graduate studies in
their fields. Computer science graduate stu
dent Pedram Kayani saicl, " The economy is
not good .. . people are taking t his opportu
nity to advance, but whose to say the\ 11 si ill be
motivated when the economy is good."

Sharon regrets not 'liquidating' Arafat
JERUSALEM (AP) — Ariel Sharon says
he's sorry he didn't have Yasser Arafat "liqui
dated" while he had a chance — 20 years ago,
during an Israeli siege of Beirut.
Sharon's musings about the missed oppor
tunity, published yesterday, raised eyebrows
abroad but wouldn't have surprised most
Middle Easterners, where the bitter, decades
long personal enmity.is widely seen as a key
element of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Israeli prime minister spoke as his
tanks surrounded Arafat's compound in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, trapping the
Palestinian leader inside. His remarks in an
interview with the Maariv daily coincide with
speculation that this time, Sharon hopes to
finish off his old enemy.
"Sharon's words are very dangerous," said
Palestinian Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat. By ex
pressing regret about not killing Arafat in 1982,
Sharon "means he want to fix his mistake."
Erekat said.
As defense minister in 1982, Sharon di
rected an Israeli invasion of Lebanon, where
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization
ruled .i virtual slate within a state. At first pre
sented as a 48-hour operation to move the
Palestinian forces out of southern Lebanon,
the war expanded and Israeli forces eventual
ly occupied Beirut.
Arafat, along with his top lieutenants and
many fighters, was forced to board ships
under the eye of the Israeli army and leave for
Tunisia. An Israeli sniper said later he had
Arafat in his gunsights, but instead of pulling
the trigger, he took a picture of the defeated
Palestinian leader.
"In Lebanon, there was an agreement not
to liquidate Yasser Arafat," Sharon told the
Maariv newspaper. "In principle, I'm sorry
that we didn't liquidate him."
Though Sharon has labeled Arafat and his
regime as terrorists, inciters and liars, Arafat
at least in the current crisis has not respond
ed in kind, refraining from personal attacks
on Israeli leaders in public. On Jan. 26, greet
ing visitors 112 rom I lebron to his encircled com
pound, the 72-year-old Arafat defied Sharon.
"I address these words to Sharon," Arafat
said. "If he thought that his tanks, which sur
round us now, will defeat us, he is mistaken.
These tanks will not shake us. They did not
shake us in Beirut."
A Palestinian close to Arafat said the em
battled leader feels Sharon is out to get him,
but Arafat does not express the same feelings
toward Sharon. 1 he Arafat confidant said the
Palestinian leader is not frightened by Sharon
and does not consider him a personal enemy.
Sharon's comments to the newspaper drew
stiff criticism from Spanish Foreign Minister
josep Pique, whose country holds the Euro
pean Union presidency. "I deplore them, and
they should not be accepted. Pique said.
Sharon's part in the Lebanon invasion drew
him a rebuke from an official Israeli commission
of inquiry, which found him indirectly responsi
ble fora massacre of Palestinian refugees in
Beirut by Christian militiamen in September
1982, while Sharon's troops controlled the area.
The commission forced Sharon to step down
as defense minister, but he slowlv made his way
