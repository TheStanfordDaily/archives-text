Financial Services at the Speed of Life
Search for Convenience
Ends with a Click and a
Smile/A
SFCU's QUAD Card
Is HUGE!
A disturbing trend is rocking the
financial world —complications so
vexingly complex that an intelligent
plexus of individuals are perplexed.
Whatzappening has the exclusive
story of one woman's nightmarish
search for convenience—and the
simple click that saved her.
My name is Erica Cloe Duzit. My
friends call me E.G. This is my story. I
stopped by the bank to see about a
loan. Next thing I knew, I was getting
a slimy sell-job from a teller that
looked like she hadn't left the vault in
years. Her personality was that of a
banana slug—and she moved at about
the same rate of speed.
"Just fill out this stack of forms,"
she said.'Wait for the forms to get
filed. Wait for Loan Headquarters to
decide on your worthiness and then
wait for the loan to get funded."
"Might as well get comfortable,"
she added. "You might be here fora
very long time." She laughed a slow
but maniacal laugh. I ran, sweating
and stumbling, from the building.
After recounting my frightening
tale to my roommate, he told me to
click-it. I felt shunned until he ex
plained that I need simply access
www.sfcu.org and click.
And so I did. I filled out the short
online membership application then
checked out their loans. I found great
rates on auto loans and on the com
puter loan I needed. I got 100% financ
ing, a generous term of 48 months
and, best of all, by using Loan Click, I
was approved in less than one minute!
I also learned that I can get E
checking, E-statements and printable
copies of cancelled checks. I can
order checks, transfer money, pay my
bills and check the status of any loan
or account with SFCU.
I even checked out their Mortgage
Mart and filled out a pre-qualifier
application so when the right piece of
property comes along, I'll be ready.
SFCU, thank you.Thank you for
offering loans at the speed of life.
E.C. Duzit couldn't
be happier since she
discovered SFCU's
electronic services.

Colossal. Enormous. The-Biggest-Dag-Burn-Thing-You-Ever-Did-See.
What is this behemoth that elicits such mammoth depiction? The
Stanford Federal Credit Union QUAD Card, of course.This giant can do it
aII—POS transactions, ATM access, checking debit card with the worldwide
acceptance ofVISA.
When you see the sign that says,"No Personal Checks",you can say," No
problem!" Just whip out the walloping QUAD Card and you get instant
respect. Each transaction is deducted from your SFCU checking account
and appears on your monthly checking statement. It's accepted anywhere
VISA cards are accepted (and that's practically everywhere).
With a card this big, you're probably wondering how it will ever fit in
your wallet. In a Whatzappening exclusive interview, SFCU CEO/President
John R. Davis revealed the secret."Using the absolute latest in financial
services technology, we were able to virtually consolidate the massive
convenience of many cards into one handy wallet-size card."
This titanic credit-union-in-a-card is available to you today. Check with
your nearby SFCU service center or log onto www.sfcu.org. It's big.
Alien Forces Holding People
Hostage with High
Interest Rates
It's not a pretty sight—and mil
lions of earthlings are at risk. The
disease: high interestitis.The symp
toms: high levels of anxiety and lower
account balances.
According to Rich R. Deneaux,
Ph.D. in Consumer Ripoffs, the symp
toms are usually slow to surface. Dr.
Deneaux attributes this to a sense of
euphoria that follows the acquisition
of a new automobile or new home.
"There's a honeymoon' period
with every high interest loan when
the consumer is so enamored by his
or her purchase that nothing else in
the world matters. Unfortunately, the
honeymoon ends too quickly and you
wake up next to a loan that is costing
you a fortune," says Deneaux.
So where does such a widespread
epidemic come from?
According to Deneaux, this is
"absolutely the work of aliens.Their
multi-step plan goes like this:
1) Drain the earthlings of their resources.
2) Descend to earth offering relief.
3) Completely take over the world and have
the female aliens bear Elvis' babies."
An independent research team from
Stanford Federal Credit Union (SFCU)
offers another theory—and a solution.
The high-interest is simply a desire for
high profits by various financial institu
tions. Advertising dollars and sheer size
of the aforementioned institutions
coerce consumers into assuming loans
with outrageously high interest rates.
(And we all know what happens when
you assume...)
SFCU's solution is simple: refinance
your high-interest loan with Stanford
Federal Credit Union. SFCU is "member
centric," not profit-driven, so they can
offer you the best rates around.
