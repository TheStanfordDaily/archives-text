This weekend, tiie ASSU, in conjunction
with various student groups including
MEChA, Students for Environmental Ac

The weekend's activities included work
shops focusing on teaching students orga

attract and retain members, work with the
media and properly run a campaign.
"The skills they teach are absolutely es
sential to understanding how to organize a
community, to organize your peers to move
toward political action ... to change your
environment and your community," said
junior Meghana Reddy, one of the coordi
nators ofSLAC.
"The whole purpose of the GROW ses

and leadership skills," said sophomore Leti

teaches them how to build a campaign
around an issue, who to contact, how to talk
to the media, how to build a coalition with
other student groups on campus and how
to properly run a campaign."
Besides attending workshops, students
from different campus organizations had
the opportunity to network.
"[There were] workshops about
strategy â€” how to concretely plan strategy

workshops in coalition building and work
