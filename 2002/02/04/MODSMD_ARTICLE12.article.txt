## The
						Stanford Daily You can help in making Volume 221 better 
### 
Published Since 1891

Welcome to Volume 221 of The
Stanford Daily. I didn't come to
Stanford planning to be the ed
itor in chief of the campus
newspaper. I didn't join The Daily intend -
ing to be editor in chief, either. As an eco
nomics major, I was more interested in the
business and advertising side of the newspa
per. But last month, I had the opportunity
to take the position and I decided the
chance to work with and lead over 80 ex
tremely talented and hard-working people
was too much to pass up.
Now that I am in this position, I realize
what a privilege it is to serve the campus in
the way that The Daily does. Many of you
rely on The Daily for coverage of campus
news, Stanford sports, arts and entertain
ment — and even the bunnies on the Classi
fieds page. I want The Daily to serve these

needs as well as it can.
Much of The Daily works extremely well
right now. I don't want to make unneces
sary changes to the paper. But there will be
a few things about this volume that will be
different.
First, Innovation will no longer exist as its
own page or section, instead, science-focused
stories and features that ran as part of Inno
vation will run in the regular news section
alongside regular news stories. Innovation
was a great section and it produced a lot of
outstanding and interesting work, but our
space needs require that we have more flexi
bility in our layouts.
Science stories will continue to be an im
portant part of the paper. But running them
in the news section will give us greater flexibil
ity. It will also allow us to run particularly in
teresting and important ones on the front

page. I encourage those of you interested in
science stories to pick up The Daily every day
to find them.
At Stanford, sports is often news. The re
sults of the teams in our Sears Cup-winning
athletic program deserve to be publicized. I
hope to run sports stories on the front page as
often as possible. I also hope to continue with
features series in the news section similar to
the recent one on East Palo Alto.
Look for our new and improved Web site
later in the spring as well. We hope to redesign
it to make it more lively, colorful and informa
tive for those on campus and away from it.
One area where everyone can contribute to
making The Daily better is through guest
columns. We encourage all members of the
Stanford community to submit guest columns
to us via e-mail at opinions@daily.stanford.edu.
The community is full of intelligent people

with diverse and interesting viewpoints on
nearly every issue. We want to serve as a forum
for publicizing and debating these ideas.
We also encourage people to e-mail
news story ideas to the news department
at news@daily.stanford.edu. While we
cannot follow up on every idea that we re
ceive, ideas from the community are a
great way to expand and broaden our
news coverage.
The Daily would be nothing without its
readers. You are our customers and we must
focus on serving you as best we can. If you
have questions or comments about the news
paper, e-mail me at eic@daily.stanford.edu,
call me at (650) 725-2100 ext. 501 or stop by
the Daily office. I hope to hear from you.
