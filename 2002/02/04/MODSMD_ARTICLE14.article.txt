Junior responds to 'unclean
alien invaders'
After reading about the dirty trespass
er who, having no property of her own,
invaded and dirtied outs', 112 feel both
worried about my security and con
cerned about my health. We're all shak
en, but the most important thing right
now is for us to stop talking about it.
We aren't paying thousands of dollars
to Stanford to be endangered by such
unclean alien invaders. Nor do we read
The Daily in order to think such un
pleasant thoughts.
Let's just leave it at this: there are mil
lions, even billions, of desperate pockets
of anger and colonies of disease around
the world. These things have problems
of their own making and should deal
with them on their own.
When they become a problem for us,
however, we should deal with them in
whatever way is most appropriate, hope
fully with a minimum of collateral dam
age. The most important thing is deter
rence of such invasions of reality.
Are we losing our souls?

Outlaw-cyclists 'shameful and offensive'
I am pleased to see that Stanford Po
lice are enforcing the sanre traffic laws
among cyclists as apply to motorists.
The 2001 California Driver Hand
book states explicitly that " [cyclists] have
the same rights and responsibilities as
automobile drivers." Regrettably, many
cyclists neglect their responsibilities,
while grasping eagerly for their rights.

They seem to want the same benefits —
legal protection, construction and main
tenance of passable roadways — as mo
torists, but recoil at the thought of as
suming the same burdens, especially
obeying traffic control devices, sharing
in road construction and maintenance
expenses and vehicle registration.
This sort of entitlement mentality is
both shameful and offensive and has lit
tle place on the Stanford campus.
As one who rides a bicycle to classes
and work every day, I can see quite
plainly the acrimony between motorists
and cyclists who disregard the rules of
the road. Some motorists show their dis
pleasure by coasting through intersec
tions where cyclists are crossing, passing
within a .few inches of a cyclist or yelling
profanities at cyclists.
Cyclists should not take advantage of
most motorists' disposition to obey traffic
laws, but rather show motorists the same
respect that they demand from mo
torists. Likewise, the few cyclists who are
cited for traffic violations should accept
the consequences of their actions honor
ably, in a manner of good citizenship.
The cyclists who are the worst offend
ers are conspicuous in their presence
and behavior. Their habits of excess
have been taken up by many other cy
clists, who see offender-cyclists' reckless
disregard for obeying traffic laws treated
with impunity.
Although other cyclists might occa
sionally imitate the ways of offenders in
disobeying a stop sign, we should never
take on the offenders' attitude of entitle
ment, or of occupying a special place
above and outside the law.
