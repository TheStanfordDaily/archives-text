# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## IHUM program must reform, impartial review necessary 
### By: JOSHUA HAWLEY RACHEL SCARLETT-TROTTER GUEST COLUMNISTS 
I he time for IHUM reform has come,
as the Daily's reporting of last week made
abundantly clear. A large majority of stu
dents and more than a few faculty mem
bers seem to agree; the question is,
where do we go from here?
Next year, the administration is
obliged to .undertake a full-scale review
ol the program. The Freedom Forum, a
new student group on campus, has cre
ated a student commission to offer input.
While we intend to suggest more con
crete ideas for reform in the spring, sev
eral points are already quite clear.

First, the mandatory IHUM review
must be truly independent. A senior fac
ulty member who is not associated with
either Area One or the University ad
ministration should head the review.
The Faculty Senate, no less than the stu
dent body, deserves a report that is im
partial, thorough and objective. Mem
bers of the Area One administration,
with a vested interest in IHUM as it now
exists, are not in a position to provide
such impartiality.
Second, the review should focus both
on ways to make Area One a coherent in
troduction to the study of the humani
ties, and on developing methods to eval
uate whether that objective is being met.
The existing Area One mission state

ment pledges IHUM will "build an intel
lectual foundation in the study of
human thought, values, beliefs, creativi
ty and culture."
To judge the program's track record,
the review might ask: do upperclassmen
refer back to texts they read in IHUM;
do they still have those texts; have they
read other works by the same authors, or
are students forced underground to
read the classic texts this missed?
Are students equipped to participate
in the disciplines of history, philosophy
and literature — the studies IHUM is
meant to introduce — or do they come
to these disciplines without a foundation
for thought and in need of remedial ed
ucation, so to speak? These are questions

that merit attention.
Finally, the review should seek new
and creative ways to structure the I HUM
program. The first quarter interdisci
plinary introduction to the "tools of hu
manists" 112 ollowed by two quarters of dis
cipline-specific study has been widely
questioned, and with good reason. Stu
dents tend not to see any connection be
tween the separate sequences and the
whole program threatens to dissolve into
a jumble of unrelated texts.
Despite the strenuous defense of the
split sequence by Area One's current di
rector, Rob Robinson, and the puzzling
claim of his associate director, Cheri Ross,
that a common reading list to help tie to
gether the different quarters and classes is

"antithetical" to the very notion of free
dom, there are surely ways to provide con
tinuity of material while encouraging di
versity of themes and teaching approaches.
We are confident that the Faculty Sen
ate, informed by an independent review,
can arrive at a healthy and sensible restruc
turing of IHUM that will teach students to
be thoughtful, learned participants in the
conversation of the humanities.
