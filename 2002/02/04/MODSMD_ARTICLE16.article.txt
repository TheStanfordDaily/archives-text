### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
California knew what it needed
to do against the Cardinal on Sat
urday. After suffering a substantial
loss to Stanford last Wednesday,
the Golden Bears came armed
with a full-court press and a clog
ging zone.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 79,
California 51

Not even that was enough to
take down the No. 3 Cardinal.
Stanford buried the Bears (7-
14,1-11 Pacific 10 Conference) 79-
51 in front of a season-high 3,176
fans at Haas Pavilion — many
wearing red — to remain perfect
in conference play at 12-0 and im
prove to 22-1 overall.
Cal opened with a full pressure
defense that faded back into a tight
zone and initially succeeded in rat
tling the Cardinal as the team
missed eight of its first 10 shots and
found itself trailing the Bears 7-5.
With the squad unable to open
up the inside, it was time for
someone to step up big on the
perimeter. That someone tin ned
out to be freshman reserve Seb
nem Kimyacioglu.
Kimyacioglu entered the game
early and missed her first attempt
of the night in those initial min
utes of confusion. It would be the
only shot she would miss for the
rest of the half.
In the next run down the court,
sophomore forward Nicole Powell
drove inside and dished the ball

back out to Kimyacioglu on the
perimeter, who drilled the three
pointer and put the Cardinal up
for the rest of the game.
The freshman shooter knocked
in four three-pointers in the half,
with one just before the buzzer on
her way to a 14-point game.
"[Sebnem] is still not shooting
enough for me," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "She's got a
great shot and she's playing real
ly well."
The combined outside shooting
efforts by Kimyacioglu and Powell,
who led the Cardinal with 16
points, forced Cal to spread its
zone and allowed Stanford to ad
just its inside game.
With Powell controlling the
ball, the Cardinal moved to its
transition game. The team pushed
the ball up the court, making
cross-court passes to the perimeter
shooters and finally generating in
side scoring. Freshman forward
Azella Perryman, initiated the
surge, posting strong with an assist
from fellow freshman T'Nae Thiel
to increase the lead 18-12.
The Bears were stubborn,
though, and hung with Stanford,
closing the gap to within three
points with about 7:30 left in the
half. The team responded by tak
ing its cue from Perryman and
took the ball to the paint.
Freshman guard Kelley Sumin
ski drove inside to score on a floater
and senior guard Lindsey Yamasa
ki fought her way under the basket
to put back an offensive board to
increase the lead to 24-19.
After missing her first two shots
of the game, senior center
Bethany Donaphin took advan
tage of the smaller Cal lineup,
making her next three shots going

back door, cutting baseline and
posting up high.
Donaphin finished the night
with 12 points and 3 blocks.
Cal returned to the second half
trailing 42-27 and stayed with the
Cardinal point-for-point, bringing
the score to 50-38 with 15:43 left in
the game.
While there might have been
over 15 minutes left to play, the
game hadjust ended for the Bears.
Powell took the ball back inside
to increase the score to 52-38 and,
on the next play, went coast-to
coast herself before pulling up to
hit a three-pointer, sparking a 19-
2 Stanford run to ensure the win.
"[Powell] likes pushing the ball
— she's the engine of that running
game," said VanDerveer.
With Cal missing two of its big
players — leading scorer and re
bounder, senior Ami Forney, who
had the flu, and reserve center

Olga Volkova, who twisted her
ankle — the transition game was a
good fit for the smaller and quick
er Bears squad.
"In the second half, we started
running better and we pushed the
tempo a lot," said Donaphin.
"I thought we had good con
tributions from different peo
ple," said VanDerveer. "At the
beginning of the game, we were
missing a lot of shots that nor
mally would have been going
down for us, but we're winning
in other ways."
The team finished the night with
four players in double digits and
every player saw time on the court.
The Cardinal continues to
dominate the Pac-10. Arizona
State, who Stanford has beaten
twice already, sits closest to the
team at only three games back.
The Cardinal leads the confer
ence in 12 of 19 statistical cate
gories as well.
The team's next test will take it
to Oregon this weekend, as it tries
to remain undefeated in confer
ence play.
