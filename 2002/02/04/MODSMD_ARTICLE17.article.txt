Josh Childress always has to
be the last one off the court
during warmups.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 19 Arizona
88, No. 15 Stanford 82

Julius Barnes will linger
around, making sure that his
three point shot is on betore the
game begins.
And Joe Kirchofer will even
offer Childress a little rebound
ing assistance as the warmup
clock winds down.
But when it all comes down
to it, Childress has to be the last
to leave and he has to hit his
last shot.
Some call it superstition, oth
ers call it routine. Whatever it is
they do at Maples Pavilion, it
seems to work.
Maples has been the Cardi
nal's saving grace and up until
Saturday, no visiting team had
walked off the hardwood floors
a winner this season.
On Saturday, when Arizona
swaggered into town, the Wild
cats came out of an overtime
game the victors with an 88-82
win over Stanford.
Arizona's victory over the
Cardinal capped off a success
ful two game road trip to the
Bay Area.
"We're just thrilled to come
on the road and face two teams
that were a combined 19-0 at

home and go home with two
wins," said Arizona head coach
Lute Olsen.
So what went wrong in this
unorthodox loss at Maples?
It may sound trite, but the
pregame ritual didn't hold up
to true form this time. Chil
dress didn't make his last shot.
The 6-foot-8 freshman kind of
grinned when he couldn't get
his final shot to fall and he
probably would have stayed on
the court longer if the an
nouncer hadn't asked every
one to stand for the playing of
the National Anthem.
Everyone should have
known right then that the game
could not have been won, that
fate had been tempted. When
ritual is broken, victory be
comes difficult.
"Road games are tough
enough in this league," coach
Mike Montgomery said. "And
when you think about it, home
games aren't always a guaran
tee, either."
As odd as it may seem, Ari
zona was the underdog in this
much anticipated matchup. Al
though, this season it's been
commonplace to view Stanford
as the struggling underachiev
er, the Cardinal was supposed to
win this game.
Stanford went into the locker
room at the half up by 10 points
and led by as many as 15 points
in the second half.
"Well we certainly had our
chances," Montgomery said. "We
had opportunities but we just
didn't finish. In a game like that
you have to make those plays and
then finally Arizona made those
plays."
The loss wasn't for lack of fan
support. Maples hasn't been like
that in a long time.
Sixth Man Club members
jumped and cheered with an un
paralleled enthusiasm. And even
the alumni stood lor the final
three minutes of play.
But Arizona has had lots of
success dealing with the opinion
ated and vocal nature of the Sixth
Man Club and they've seen
crowds more raucous than Stan
ford's ultra-conservative alumni
fan base. They seem to thrive in
situations like this.
"Arizona has beat us three
times in a row here," Jacobsen
said. "That's frustrating. It's a lot

like the situation that I was talk
ing about when we play at Pauley
.[UCLA], They've had success
here. They feel comfortable here.
And there's not really much we
can do about that."
"1 think it's the schedule that
Coach Olsen gives us every year
that gets us ready for games like
this," said junior forward Luke
Walton. "I think this is why we
go and play at Michigan State
and places like that, so when we
get into conference and the
games really matter, we're com
fortable."
The loss to Arizona left Cardi
nal players reeling. Six measly
points stood between Stanford's
re-establishment of itself atop the
conference standings and its cur
rent fifth place ranking.
"Just as bad as we needed
Thursday night's win [against Ari
zona State], we needed tonight's,"
Jacobsen said. "With just one or
two plays we could have been
right back at the top of this league.
So close yet so far. It's hard."
As Stanford approaches the

second half of the Pac-10 season,
the Cardinal can't make missing
huge opportunities like this one
of its season's rituals.

So close yet so far. It's hard."
As Stanford approaches the

second half of the Pac-10 season,
the Cardinal can't make missing
huge opportunities like this one
of its season's rituals.

Josh Childress always has to
be the last one off the court
during warmups.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 19 Arizona
88, No. 15 Stanford 82

Julius Barnes will linger
around, making sure that his
three point shot is on betore the
game begins.
And Joe Kirchofer will even
offer Childress a little rebound
ing assistance as the warmup
clock winds down.
But when it all comes down
to it, Childress has to be the last
to leave and he has to hit his
last shot.
Some call it superstition, oth
ers call it routine. Whatever it is
they do at Maples Pavilion, it
seems to work.
Maples has been the Cardi
nal's saving grace and up until
Saturday, no visiting team had
walked off the hardwood floors
a winner this season.
On Saturday, when Arizona
swaggered into town, the Wild
cats came out of an overtime
game the victors with an 88-82
win over Stanford.
Arizona's victory over the
Cardinal capped off a success
ful two game road trip to the
Bay Area.
"We're just thrilled to come
on the road and face two teams
that were a combined 19-0 at

home and go home with two
wins," said Arizona head coach
Lute Olsen.
So what went wrong in this
unorthodox loss at Maples?
It may sound trite, but the
pregame ritual didn't hold up
to true form this time. Chil
dress didn't make his last shot.
The 6-foot-8 freshman kind of
grinned when he couldn't get
his final shot to fall and he
probably would have stayed on
the court longer if the an
nouncer hadn't asked every
one to stand for the playing of
the National Anthem.
Everyone should have
known right then that the game
could not have been won, that
fate had been tempted. When
ritual is broken, victory be
comes difficult.
"Road games are tough
enough in this league," coach
Mike Montgomery said. "And
when you think about it, home
games aren't always a guaran
tee, either."
As odd as it may seem, Ari
zona was the underdog in this
much anticipated matchup. Al
though, this season it's been
commonplace to view Stanford
as the struggling underachiev
er, the Cardinal was supposed to
win this game.
Stanford went into the locker
room at the half up by 10 points
and led by as many as 15 points
in the second half.
"Well we certainly had our
chances," Montgomery said. "We
had opportunities but we just
didn't finish. In a game like that
you have to make those plays and
then finally Arizona made those
plays."
The loss wasn't for lack of fan
support. Maples hasn't been like
that in a long time.
Sixth Man Club members
jumped and cheered with an un
paralleled enthusiasm. And even
the alumni stood lor the final
three minutes of play.
But Arizona has had lots of
success dealing with the opinion
ated and vocal nature of the Sixth
Man Club and they've seen
crowds more raucous than Stan
ford's ultra-conservative alumni
fan base. They seem to thrive in
situations like this.
"Arizona has beat us three
times in a row here," Jacobsen
said. "That's frustrating. It's a lot

like the situation that I was talk
ing about when we play at Pauley
.[UCLA], They've had success
here. They feel comfortable here.
And there's not really much we
can do about that."
"1 think it's the schedule that
Coach Olsen gives us every year
that gets us ready for games like
this," said junior forward Luke
Walton. "I think this is why we
go and play at Michigan State
and places like that, so when we
get into conference and the
games really matter, we're com
fortable."
The loss to Arizona left Cardi
nal players reeling. Six measly
points stood between Stanford's
re-establishment of itself atop the
conference standings and its cur
rent fifth place ranking.
"Just as bad as we needed
Thursday night's win [against Ari
zona State], we needed tonight's,"
Jacobsen said. "With just one or
two plays we could have been
right back at the top of this league.
So close yet so far. It's hard."
