Josh Childress always has to
be the last one off the court
during warmups.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 19 Arizona
88, No. 15 Stanford 82

Julius Barnes will linger
around, making sure that his
three point shot is on betore the
game begins.
And Joe Kirchofer will even
offer Childress a little rebound
ing assistance as the warmup
clock winds down.
But when it all comes down
to it, Childress has to be the last
to leave and he has to hit his
last shot.
Some call it superstition, oth
ers call it routine. Whatever it is
they do at Maples Pavilion, it
seems to work.
Maples has been the Cardi

Saturday, no visiting team had

one to stand for the playing of
the National Anthem.
Everyone should have
known right then that the game
could not have been won, that
fate had been tempted. When
ritual is broken, victory be
comes difficult.
"Road games are tough
enough in this league," coach
Mike Montgomery said. "And
when you think about it, home
games aren't always a guaran
tee, either."
As odd as it may seem, Ari
zona was the underdog in this
much anticipated matchup. Al
though, this season it's been
commonplace to view Stanford
as the struggling underachiev
er, the Cardinal was supposed to
win this game.
Stanford went into the locker
room at the half up by 10 points
and led by as many as 15 points
in the second half.
"Well we certainly had our
