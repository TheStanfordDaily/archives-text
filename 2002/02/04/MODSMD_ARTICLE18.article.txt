For two days at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford proved the mer
its of its unanimous No. 1 rank
ing. The next, it showed why an
other trip to the national cham
pionship game is no shoo-in.
After a well-pitched 7-4 win in
the opener and a 17-1 thrashing
on Saturday, the Cardinal (2-1)
dropped its season-opening se
ries finale, 8-3, to No. 15 Cal
State-Fullerton (1-2) yesterday at
Sunken Diamond.
Top-ranked Stanford cruised
to victory on Friday night on the
strength of a three-run Carlos

Quentin home run in his first
2002 at-bat. The sophomore ac
complished the feat for the sec
ond time, as tie also blasted a
three-run bomb in his first-ever
plate appearance in the Cardi
nal's 2001 opener at Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
"It's kind of funny," Quentin

said. "I wasn't really thinking
about that too much, but it kind
of hit me at the end when people
reminded me. It was a big mo
mentum boost that we really
needed to start things off."
Quentin came out of the first
weekend of the 2002 campaign
with two home runs and seven
RBI, immediately establishing
himself as an imposing presence
in the Stanford lineup. His suc
cess keys much of the Cardinal
offense, and the respect Fuller
ton showed him ultimately
meant better pitches for hitters
in front of him in.the batting
order. Junior Jason Cooper,
after struggling much of last sea
son at the plate, tore through
Titan pitching in all three games
at a .500 clip in the cleanup spot
ahead of'Quentin.
"I'm taking a different ap
proach to the plate this year,"
Cooper said of his hot start. "If 1
get a strike, I'm going to hit it.
And it definitely helps to have
Carlos behind you."
Friday night also saw stellar
pitching performances from two
junior hurlers, the always-reli
able Jeremy Guthrie and the
emerging Ryan McCally.
Guthrie displayed the outstand
ing control and quality move
ment on his pitches that made
him one of college baseball's best
last season, allowing four runs —
only two of them earned — in six
innings while fanning nine 1i
