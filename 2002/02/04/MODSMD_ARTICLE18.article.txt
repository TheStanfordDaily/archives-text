### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For two days at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford proved the mer
its of its unanimous No. 1 rank
ing. The next, it showed why an
other trip to the national cham
pionship game is no shoo-in.
After a well-pitched 7-4 win in
the opener and a 17-1 thrashing
on Saturday, the Cardinal (2-1)
dropped its season-opening se
ries finale, 8-3, to No. 15 Cal
State-Fullerton (1-2) yesterday at
Sunken Diamond.

Quentin home run in his first
2002 at-bat. The sophomore ac
complished the feat for the sec
ond time, as tie also blasted a
three-run bomb in his first-ever
plate appearance in the Cardi
nal's 2001 opener at Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
"It's kind of funny," Quentin

said. "I wasn't really thinking
about that too much, but it kind
of hit me at the end when people
reminded me. It was a big mo
mentum boost that we really
needed to start things off."
Quentin came out of the first
weekend of the 2002 campaign
with two home runs and seven
RBI, immediately establishing
himself as an imposing presence
in the Stanford lineup. His suc
cess keys much of the Cardinal
offense, and the respect Fuller
ton showed him ultimately
meant better pitches for hitters
in front of him in.the batting
order. Junior Jason Cooper,
after struggling much of last sea
son at the plate, tore through
Titan pitching in all three games
at a .500 clip in the cleanup spot
ahead of'Quentin.
"I'm taking a different ap
proach to the plate this year,"
Cooper said of his hot start. "If 1
get a strike, I'm going to hit it.
And it definitely helps to have
Carlos behind you."

pitching performances from two
junior hurlers, the always-reli

tans without a single walk.
"At first 1 think I was a little bit
nervous because it's been a long
time since 1 was out there,"
Guthrie said. "But 1 think it was a
real positive start for me."
McCally entered in the seventh
and shut the door on any chance
fora Fullerton comeback. He
pitched to the final ten batters and
the Titans managed only one hit
against the right-hander, striking
out five times.

On Saturday, Stanford handed
Fullerton its worst loss in school
history with a dazzling offensive
display. Cooper and junior Ryan
Garko had career days at the plate,
each collecting four hits and com
bining for six RBI. The Cardinal
turned a 3-1 game into a laugher
with a nine-run fourth inning
keyed by sophomore left fielder
Brian Hall.
Hall's bases-clearing double
brought three home and made
the score 8-1. He homered an in
ning later to give him a grand total
of six RBI on the day, which was
his best at the plate during his two
year career.

Junior southpaw Tim Cun
ningham overcame a shaky first
inning to keep the Titans in
check, throwing six innings of
five-hit, one-run ball. Cunning
ham allowed two singles, threw a
wild pitch and then hit a batter to
begin the game, but after a sacri
fice fly and a walk he induced a
huge double-play grounder to
second to end ihe only Fullerton
threat of the game.
Sunday, freshman Mark Jee
men's Cardinal debut went sour
quickly. Fullerton chased the
youngster with two outs in the
second inning, roughing him up
with seven hits and four runs to

build a 4-0 lead that the Titans
would never relinquish. Howev
er, head coach Mark Marquess
said he was pleased with the fresh
man's outing in terms of control
and composure.
. "1 had the shakes, but you have
to go out there and make the
throws," Jecmen said. "It's a learn
ing experience every time you go
out there, so I should be a little
more confident next time and
hopefully I'll throw better."
After an encouraging first se
ries, the Cardinal head to Talla
hassee, Fla. to face the seventh

this weekend.

Quentin home run in his first
2002 at-bat. The sophomore ac
complished the feat for the sec
ond time, as tie also blasted a
three-run bomb in his first-ever
plate appearance in the Cardi

Luis Obispo.
"It's kind of funny," Quentin

said. "I wasn't really thinking
about that too much, but it kind
of hit me at the end when people
reminded me. It was a big mo
mentum boost that we really
needed to start things off."
Quentin came out of the first
weekend of the 2002 campaign
with two home runs and seven
RBI, immediately establishing
himself as an imposing presence
in the Stanford lineup. His suc

offense, and the respect Fuller

meant better pitches for hitters

after struggling much of last sea
son at the plate, tore through
Titan pitching in all three games
at a .500 clip in the cleanup spot
ahead of'Quentin.
"I'm taking a different ap
proach to the plate this year,"
Cooper said of his hot start. "If 1
get a strike, I'm going to hit it.
And it definitely helps to have
Carlos behind you."

"At first 1 think I was a little bit
nervous because it's been a long
time since 1 was out there,"
Guthrie said. "But 1 think it was a
real positive start for me."
McCally entered in the seventh
and shut the door on any chance
fora Fullerton comeback. He
pitched to the final ten batters and
the Titans managed only one hit
against the right-hander, striking
out five times.

On Saturday, Stanford handed
Fullerton its worst loss in school
history with a dazzling offensive
display. Cooper and junior Ryan
Garko had career days at the plate,
each collecting four hits and com
bining for six RBI. The Cardinal
turned a 3-1 game into a laugher
with a nine-run fourth inning
keyed by sophomore left fielder
Brian Hall.
Hall's bases-clearing double
brought three home and made
the score 8-1. He homered an in
ning later to give him a grand total
of six RBI on the day, which was
his best at the plate during his two
year career.

Junior southpaw Tim Cun
ningham overcame a shaky first
inning to keep the Titans in
check, throwing six innings of
five-hit, one-run ball. Cunning
ham allowed two singles, threw a
wild pitch and then hit a batter to
begin the game, but after a sacri
fice fly and a walk he induced a
huge double-play grounder to
second to end ihe only Fullerton
threat of the game.
Sunday, freshman Mark Jee
men's Cardinal debut went sour
quickly. Fullerton chased the
youngster with two outs in the
second inning, roughing him up
with seven hits and four runs to

build a 4-0 lead that the Titans
would never relinquish. Howev
er, head coach Mark Marquess
said he was pleased with the fresh
man's outing in terms of control
and composure.
. "1 had the shakes, but you have
to go out there and make the
throws," Jecmen said. "It's a learn
ing experience every time you go
out there, so I should be a little
more confident next time and
hopefully I'll throw better."
After an encouraging first se
ries, the Cardinal head to Talla
hassee, Fla. to face the seventh
ranked Florida State Seminoles
this weekend.
