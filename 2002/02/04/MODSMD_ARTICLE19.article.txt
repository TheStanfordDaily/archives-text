ford 6, Santa Clara 1,

The Cardinal took the field on
Saturday with its highest ranking in
Stanford history and an excitement
that had been building up since last
years ('.ollege World Series finish.
"We had so much energy and
were just so excited to be on the
field," Beeson said. "You kind of
want to make a statement on
opening day, prove that the rank
ings weren't wrong and that you
really deserve to be the No. 3 team
in the nation."
Stanford rocked the Broncos in
the first contest, scoring 1 1 runs in
an early-ending five-inning game.
The Cardinal bats warmed up in
the first two innings before ex
ploding in the third, when Stan
ford broke through with II runs.
The entire Stanford squad pro
duced at the plate â€” each starter
recorded at least one hit on the day.
Senior Jessica Mendoza and ju
nior KiraChingled the Cardinal of l
fense in the first match-up, with
both going 2-3 at the plate, while
Mendoza and senior Robin Walker
each scored two runs.

"lt was a great opening day,"
Walker said. "Our team just came
out fired up. Santa Clara always
plays us tough, and we know that.
But, it was really great to see our
team hitting the ball and playing re
ally good defense."
The unstoppable Cardinal of
fense was overshadowed only by
Stanford's highlight-reel defensive
plays that seemed to keep outshin
ing one another.
"I think defensively we are the
best we have ever been in the be
ginning of February, and we can
only get better," said senior first
baseman Sarah Beeson.
Beeson was one of four Cardinal
players to make outstretched div
ing catches that drew roars from
the record-breaking crowd of 640

Stanford softball fans.
"I definitely think we were in
credibly excited to be out playing
today," Beeson said. "Wejust want
ed to leave it all on the field."
Mendo/a, Beeson, junior left
fielder Cassi Brangham and sopho
more catcher Jessica Allister led the
Cardinal defensive effort, cutting
off any offensive attacks the Bron
cos attempted to launch.
The Cardinal pitching staff also
turned in an equally impressive
performance in its first outings.
