"We had so much energy and

field," Beeson said. "You kind of
want to make a statement on
opening day, prove that the rank
ings weren't wrong and that you
really deserve to be the No. 3 team
in the nation."
Stanford rocked the Broncos in
the first contest, scoring 1 1 runs in
an early-ending five-inning game.
The Cardinal bats warmed up in
the first two innings before ex

out fired up. Santa Clara always
plays us tough, and we know that.
But, it was really great to see our
team hitting the ball and playing re

The unstoppable Cardinal of
fense was overshadowed only by
Stanford's highlight-reel defensive
plays that seemed to keep outshin

"I think defensively we are the
best we have ever been in the be
ginning of February, and we can
only get better," said senior first
baseman Sarah Beeson.
Beeson was one of four Cardinal
players to make outstretched div
ing catches that drew roars from
the record-breaking crowd of 640

Stanford softball fans.
"I definitely think we were in
credibly excited to be out playing
today," Beeson said. "Wejust want
