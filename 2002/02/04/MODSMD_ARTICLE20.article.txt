### KAT LAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford (5-5, 4-3, Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) fell mightily when
it lost two consecutive matches this week
end to No. 10 Lewis (4-3) on Friday, and
No. 6 Penn State (5-2) on Saturday.
"We needed practice this weekend, but
all we got were matches," said head coach
Don Shaw.
Though it may not have been the type
of practice that it wanted, Stanford at least

Friday: No. 10 Lewis defeated No. 2
Stanford 30-24, 32-30, 20-30, 32-34,
15-11
Saturday: No. 6 Penn State defeated
No. 2 Stanford 31-29, 30-26, 27-30,
30-25

gained experience against two of the na
tion's best teams, in front of an enthusias
tic audience of over 2,000 fans on the

NCAA Championship court.
After losing two key mate lies to No. 4
Hawaii last week, the Cardinal went east
to the Penn State NCAA Preview Tour
nament with high hopes of regaining
footing.
However, its hopes were far from ful
filled as inconsistent play extended Stan
lord's losing streak to four matches.
"We didn't make the plays we needed
to make at the right times, and we missed
opportunities,'' Shaw s?ii< 1.
A match-high 30 kills from junior op

posite Curt Toppel wasn't enough to hold
Stanford against Lewis.
Though Lewis took the first two games
on Friday, 30-24, 32-30, Stanford rallied
back to win the next two games, 30-20 and
34-32, to force a fifth game.
But the comeback was all for naught
when Stanford posted a pitiful .133 hit
ting percentage to Lewis',467 mark in the
fifth game.
On Saturday night, Cardinal hopes of
redeeming itself after Friday's loss were
quickly dissipated when Penn State

jumped ahead with 31-29 and 30-26 wins
in the first two games.
Toppel sparked an offensive comeback
in the third game, leading to a 30-27 Car
dinal win.
The Cardinal's offense fizzled in the
fourth game as Stanford only hit .174 in a
30-25 loss.
I'oppel, junior outside hitter Marcus
Skacel, and junior outside hitter Billy
Strickland contributed double-digit kills
with 21, 11, and 10 respectively.
Stanford was outdug by the
Lions 46-26, who also outhit the
Cardinal .376 to .301. Penn State
put up a season-high 71 kills to

Stanford's 50.
"Every mistake costs us," Shaw
said. "We need to work on our fun
damental skills."
The Cardinal will look to return
to the win column this week as it
takes on Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation foes No. 6 UC-Santa
Barbara and No. 15 University of
the Pacific.
