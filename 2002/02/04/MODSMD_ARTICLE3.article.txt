Programs in African and African-American
studies at universities throughout the
country, including Harvard, have recently
drawn much negative attention. However, Stan

"I'm proud of our program in African and
African-American Studies," he said. "Ihe pro
gram has ... a set of distinguished leaders [rang

early days, to John Rickford today, with many of
