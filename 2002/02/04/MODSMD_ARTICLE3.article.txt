# Program in AAAS thrives
## By GEORGE K. TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER

Programs in African and African-American
studies at universities throughout the
country, including Harvard, have recently
drawn much negative attention. However, Stan
ford's program in African and African-American
Studies, now in its 33rd year, still has over
whelming University support.
The program is the first of its kind in the na
tion. According to Linguistics Prof. John Rick
ford, the director of the program, the quantity
and quality of students in the program are mea
sures of its excellence.
"The program is doing extremely well," he
said. "The number of graduating majors jumped
from three in the first decade that Bachelor's de
grees in AAAS were awarded (1971 -80), to 26 in
the second decade (1981-90) to 50 in the third
and most recent decade (1991-2000). Our stu
dents have included Phi Beta Kappa nominees,
and many engage in honors thesis research."
Provost John Etchemendy praised the pro
gram's accomplishments.
"I'm proud of our program in African and
African-American Studies," he said. "Ihe pro
gram has ... a set of distinguished leaders [rang
ing] from St. Clair Drake and Jim Gibbs in its
early days, to John Rickford today, with many of
our finest faculty in between."
Comparable programs offered at other in
stitutions are not generating this level of sup
port, however.
Harvard University President Lawrence
Summers was noted for nationally questioning
the work of the school's own African-American
Studies Prof. Cornel West. According to the Har
vard Crimson, this rift sparked African-Ameri
can Studies Prof. K. Anthony Appiah's resigna-
tion from Harvard in favor of
Princeton.
Prof. Christopher Lucas of the
University of Arkansas, mean
while, commented in the Los An
geles limes that black studies have
only gained limited academic ac
ceptance at his institution.
Tension within black studies
departments was generalized to
universities at large by James Stew
art, a labor economist at Penn State
and former director of the school's
black studies department, in the
same article.
The field still has "a very tenu
ous relationship in many institu
tions," Stewart said.
The generalization above
doesn't apply to Stanford, where
current students of the program
also offer their support for its goals
and initiatives.
Senior Christopher Maloney,
an honors major in African and
African-American Studies, said his
experience in the department has
been very positive.
"It is definitely meeting student
expectations," said Maloney, who
is also a student representative for
the program's advisory commit
tee. "AA\S is an extremely nurtur
ing and supportive environment

that has incredible structures in
place for its majors and minors."
Jerri Kay, who completed a
major in African and African-
American Studies last year and is
currently finishing a coterminal
degree in sociology , was quick to
point out the benefits she gained
from the curriculum.
"I really grew as an individual
by taking this major because 1 had
a better understanding of myself
and my community," she said.
Members of the administration
affiliated with the program show a
similar level of supÂ»port. Sharon
Long, dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, said she be
lieves "the subject matter of AAAS
is an important component of our
race and ethnicity programs."
Long noted that AAAS received
a positive interdepartmental eval
uation review and that "the Cur
riculum Committee of Humanities
and Sciences unanimously voted
to recommend that the program
be re-authorized by the [Faculty]
Senate for five years."
At the base of this level of sup
port is the program's focused
mission.
"[We want] to facilitate and en
hance the study at this university of
the histories, languages, litera
tures, cultures and societies of
Africans and their descendants in
the New World, especially African
Americans," Rickford said.

Rickfbrd also noted the pro
gram's comparative nature.
"The comparative thrust has
been strengthened in recent years
by the inclusion of AAAS under the
umbrella of the newly created
Center for the Comparative Study
of Race and Ethnicity," he said.
But even with this ambitious
focus and overwhelming sup
port, the program is not without
its weaknesses.
Maloney cited a concern with
the course selection.
"Class offerings get smaller and
smaller every year, it seems," he
said. "There is a definite need to
hire more faculty, especially in the
social sciences, to work in African
and African-American Studies."
History Prof. Clayborne Car
son, director of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project,
added that "the lack of ability to
appoint faculty members is a
major weakness."
Despite these shortcomings,
Rickford said he believes Stan
ford's AAAS program can rival any
comparable program in the nation.
"We compare favorably with
Harvard and other leading pro
grams like Princeton, Yale and
[UC-Berkeley] in many respects,
including the range of courses of
fered, the distinction of our affili
ated faculty and the fact that we
are able to attract research visi
tors," he said.
