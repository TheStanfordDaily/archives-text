# Cardinal comes up short in OT
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
There were a lot of "would haves" and
"could haves" used in Stanford's post-game
press conference on Saturday.
Unfortunately for Cardinal fans, this basic
undertone is beginning to have a familiar
ling: "If we would have made plays down the
stretch, we could have won the game."
Once again, No. 18 Stanford didn't make
those plays, and it didn't win the game. For
the fourth time in five weeks, the Cardinal
missed an opportunity to pick up a confer
ence sweep by losing the weekend game,
this time an 88-82 overtime defeat to Ari
zona in front of 7,391 at Maples Pavilion.
"We certainly had our chances," Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery said." Wejust
weren't able to complete plays when they
needed to be made."
Sound familiar? Try Oregon. Try Cal.
Try Southern California.
This time, despite a rowdy home crowd,
Stanford (13-6, 6-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
relinquished a 15-point second-half lead
and lost for the first time at home this sea
son. Despite looking composed throughout
much of the game, the Cardinal players
looked timid when it mattered the most.
"We've been in that situation before,"
Montgomery said. "We've just got to get
better mentally and more disciplined in the
things we're trying to do and learn from
these kinds of experiences."
And while Stanford looked reticent, Ari
zona looked tough. The Wildcats (15-6,8-3)
upped the tempo of the game in the second
half, spreading the court on defense and
not allowing the Cardinal players to get
good looks at the basket. When it came
down to it, Arizona, which also lost four
starters this year, seemed like the more vet
eran team, and came away with its third
straight victory at Maples Pavilion.
"This place is so tough to play," Arizona

coach Lute Olson said. "But our guys love
that kind of atmosphere. It gets their com
petitive juices flowing even more."
At this point, it looks like the mental
toughness Montgomery alluded to seems to
be the Cardinal's biggest problem.
Throughout its three conference losses,
many of Stanford's players have looked un
comfortable down the stretch.
Arizona, on the other hand, looked just
the opposite on Saturday: Headstrong,
comfortable and confident.
"It's the schedule Coach [Olson] gives us
every year," said Arizona forward Luke
Walton, who finished with 20 points.
"When we get to conference games, we're
used to it. That really matters."
Stanford failed to make a field goal in the
final 6:10 of regulation, and its last four pos
sessions before overtime were less than
memorable: two missed layups, an airball
and an offensive foul.
"We're all Division I scholarship players
and there's no excuse for missing layups,"
said junior Casey Jacobsen, who tallied 24
points and six assists.
The struggles continued in the extra ses
sion when the Cardinal managed only one
field goal, while Arizona scored on three of
its first four possessions and pulled ahead.
All in all, the game was intense and the
play was fierce. Stanford came out strong and
its offense looked sharp as the Cardinal took
a 19-9 early lead. It then led 43-33 at the half.
Arizona's Jason Gardner, who scored 20
points, led an energetic Wildcat team on a
12-4 run late in the second half to cut Stan
ford's lead to 71-70 with 4:25 to play. Tied
at 75 with five seconds left, Gardner missed
a 15-foot jump shot, and the game was sent
to overtime.
"It was a great college basketball game,"
Olson said. "Every time there was a loose
ball, players were Hying all over the place.

Junior center Curtis Borchardt finishes a dunk in Saturday's game against
Arizona. Despite Borchardt's 25 points and career-high 21 rebounds, Stan
ford fell in overtime, 88-82.
"It's pretty obvious that both
teams out there had a lot of heart
and a lot of courage."
The loss overshadowed strong
performances by junior center
Curtis Borchardt and sophomore
forward Teyo Johnson. Bor
chardt led the Cardinal with his
eighth double-double of the sea
son, totaling 25 points and a ca
reer-high 21 rebounds. Johnson,
who did an admirable job of
avoiding fouling out in 31 min

utes of play, tallied 12 points and
seven rebounds.
Despite outrebounding the
Wildcats 47-36, it seemed as if the
Cardinal missed boards at the
most crucial moments of the game.
The loss dropped Stanford 2
1/2 games behind conference
frontrunner Oregon, who defeat
ed USC at Mac Arthur Court on
Saturday. Stanford is now tied for
fifth in the Pac-10 and will host the
Ducks this Thursday at 7:00 p.m.
"That game would have put us
close to the top," Johnson said.
"We want to control the Pac-10
and losing this game is making it
hard on us."

the fourth time in five weeks, the Cardinal
missed an opportunity to pick up a confer
ence sweep by losing the weekend game,
this time an 88-82 overtime defeat to Ari
zona in front of 7,391 at Maples Pavilion.
"We certainly had our chances," Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery said." Wejust
weren't able to complete plays when they
needed to be made."
Sound familiar? Try Oregon. Try Cal.
Try Southern California.
This time, despite a rowdy home crowd,
Stanford (13-6, 6-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
relinquished a 15-point second-half lead
and lost for the first time at home this sea
son. Despite looking composed throughout
much of the game, the Cardinal players
looked timid when it mattered the most.
"We've been in that situation before,"
Montgomery said. "We've just got to get
better mentally and more disciplined in the
things we're trying to do and learn from
these kinds of experiences."
And while Stanford looked reticent, Ari
zona looked tough. The Wildcats (15-6,8-3)
upped the tempo of the game in the second
half, spreading the court on defense and
not allowing the Cardinal players to get
good looks at the basket. When it came
down to it, Arizona, which also lost four
starters this year, seemed like the more vet
eran team, and came away with its third
straight victory at Maples Pavilion.
"This place is so tough to play," Arizona

coach Lute Olson said. "But our guys love
that kind of atmosphere. It gets their com
petitive juices flowing even more."
At this point, it looks like the mental
toughness Montgomery alluded to seems to
be the Cardinal's biggest problem.
Throughout its three conference losses,
many of Stanford's players have looked un
comfortable down the stretch.
Arizona, on the other hand, looked just
the opposite on Saturday: Headstrong,
comfortable and confident.
"It's the schedule Coach [Olson] gives us
every year," said Arizona forward Luke
Walton, who finished with 20 points.
"When we get to conference games, we're
used to it. That really matters."
Stanford failed to make a field goal in the
final 6:10 of regulation, and its last four pos
sessions before overtime were less than
memorable: two missed layups, an airball
and an offensive foul.
"We're all Division I scholarship players
and there's no excuse for missing layups,"
said junior Casey Jacobsen, who tallied 24
points and six assists.
The struggles continued in the extra ses
sion when the Cardinal managed only one
field goal, while Arizona scored on three of
its first four possessions and pulled ahead.
All in all, the game was intense and the
play was fierce. Stanford came out strong and
its offense looked sharp as the Cardinal took
a 19-9 early lead. It then led 43-33 at the half.
Arizona's Jason Gardner, who scored 20
points, led an energetic Wildcat team on a
12-4 run late in the second half to cut Stan
ford's lead to 71-70 with 4:25 to play. Tied
at 75 with five seconds left, Gardner missed
a 15-foot jump shot, and the game was sent
to overtime.
"It was a great college basketball game,"
Olson said. "Every time there was a loose
ball, players were Hying all over the place.

Junior center Curtis Borchardt finishes a dunk in Saturday's game against
Arizona. Despite Borchardt's 25 points and career-high 21 rebounds, Stan
ford fell in overtime, 88-82.
"It's pretty obvious that both
teams out there had a lot of heart
and a lot of courage."
The loss overshadowed strong
performances by junior center
Curtis Borchardt and sophomore
forward Teyo Johnson. Bor
chardt led the Cardinal with his
eighth double-double of the sea
son, totaling 25 points and a ca
reer-high 21 rebounds. Johnson,
who did an admirable job of
avoiding fouling out in 31 min

utes of play, tallied 12 points and
seven rebounds.
Despite outrebounding the
Wildcats 47-36, it seemed as if the
Cardinal missed boards at the
most crucial moments of the game.
The loss dropped Stanford 2
1/2 games behind conference
frontrunner Oregon, who defeat
ed USC at Mac Arthur Court on
Saturday. Stanford is now tied for
fifth in the Pac-10 and will host the
Ducks this Thursday at 7:00 p.m.
"That game would have put us
close to the top," Johnson said.
"We want to control the Pac-10
and losing this game is making it
hard on us."
There were a lot of "would haves" and
"could haves" used in Stanford's post-game
press conference on Saturday.
Unfortunately for Cardinal fans, this basic
undertone is beginning to have a familiar
ling: "If we would have made plays down the
stretch, we could have won the game."
