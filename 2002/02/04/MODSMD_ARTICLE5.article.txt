# Unidentified plague strikes Toyon

### ANNA GALAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent outbreak of a mysterious flu-like virus in
Toyon Hall has University officials and residence staff
working to stop its spread. The virus, which is
marked by nausea, vomiting and in some cases diar
rhea and fever has affected more than 70 of Toyon's
approximately 200 residents over the past two weeks,
according to the dormitory's peer health educator,
sophomore Orion Courtin.
"The big outbreak was January 23, with 12 people
initially getting sick," Courtin said. A second wave of
students reported feeling ill last Tuesday.

The cause of the virus has not been determined.
Courtin originally suspected food poisoning because
so many students became ill at exactly the same time.
However, this possibility was ruled out because the ill
ness could not be traced to a common food source.
According to Robyn Tepper, chief of medical ser
vices at Cowell Student Health Center, the virus can
likely be attributed to a more innocuous cause: stu
dents' close living conditions in dorm settings.
"Dormitories are a great place for viruses to flour
ish," Tepper said. "There are many people in close
contact with each other." Tepper noted that, specifi
cally, shared bathrooms and dining areas promote
the spread of viruses.
Tepper recommends that once students are sick,
they should not eat or drink for at least one to two hours
after the vomiting stops. Students should then slowly
begin drinking very small amounts of water, one sip or
ice cube at a time. Viruses, such as the one spreading
through Toyon, cannot be treated with antibiotics.
Courtin cited Toyon's close-knit community as one
of the reasons for the virus's rampage. "I think it real
ly just proves how much we share as a community
here at Toyon," he said.
However, Toyon Resident Fellow Rolf Faste ar
gued that the current circumstances are rare due to
the large percentage of the dormitory's residents that
have become ill.
"We're all calling it a plague, but the only real med
ical concern is dehydration" due to frequent bouts of
vomiting, he said.
Faste met with Student Affairs Officer James Ca
dena, Director of Residential Education Jane Camar
illo, Housing Facilities Supervisor Mia Ingraham,
Cowell officials Ira Friedman and Tepper, Toyon res
ident assistants and Toyon Eating Clubs' managers
Friday to brainstorm ideas on slowing or eliminating
the spread of the virus.
"The single biggest [question] is how to improve
people's sanitary habits," Faste said. He noted the
need for frequent hand washing, as well as keeping
the restrooms and common areas clean.
During the meeting it was decided that Toyon's
cleaning staff—who normally clean the dorm com
mon areas only during the week — would clean this
past weekend as well.
Students said the shared experience has served to
unite Toyon's residents.
"It's brought people together," Toyon Resident
Assistant William Ridgway, a junior, said of the virus.
