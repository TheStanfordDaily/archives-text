# New studies look at forgiveness
## 
### GOHAR GALYAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To earn his doctorate in counseling and health psy
chology from Stanford in 1997, Fred Luskin had to
write a dissertation. At the time, Luskin was furious
with a friend. To complete his graduation require
ment and to cope with the pain, Luskin researched
and wrote about forgiveness.
"1 couldn't do it. I couldn't forgive," he said. "I was
badly hurt by a friend of mine and it threw my world
upside down."
Luskin, now a research associate with the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Prevention, focused on

Stanford students' experiences when he initially
began studying forgiveness. In 1999, after earning his
doctorate, Luskin launched the original Stanford For
giveness Project, which studied Bay Area residents.
According to Luskin, the study involved 260 partici
pants, including 100 men.
"The results were very positive," Luskin said. "Peo
ple showed less stress, less anger, more optimism and
more forgiveness."
Research is conducted in a workshop format and
typically lasts from five to six weeks, he said. In his re
search, he teaches forgiveness as a skill.
"It is not therapy. It is teaching
people how to learn this kind of
skill," he said. "We can teach people
to forgive and that will improve their
well-being."
The Stanford Forgiveness Pro
ject has evolved and now exists as an
umbrella organization for numer
ous Stanford research projects that
address forgiveness.
Over the years, researchers with
the Stanford Forgiveness Project
have worked with families from Ire
land who have lost loved ones due to
civil strife. The Stanford-Northern
Ireland HOPE Project has conduct
ed research on three different occa
sions with Irish families.
Two current research projects

study the connection between for
giveness and health. One researches
the connection between forgiveness
and high blood pressure and anoth
er looks into forgiveness and its ef
fects in pre-menopausal women.
According to Luskin, there was so
much interest in the research Uiat a
complementary clinic was opened
on the University campus. Luskin
now teaches four to five long work
shops on forgiveness. He has also au
thored a book, "Forgive for (nxxl."
One of those impacted by-
Luskin's research is Catherine
O'Brien, director of video pro
gram development at University
Communications.
"I had heard Fred's audio tape
'Art and Science of Forgiveness,' "
O'Brien said. "[On the audio
tape] Fred laid out what forgive
ness was. To me, the most impor
tant thing was that when you are

angry you are only hurting your
self. You are not hurting the per
son that you are mad at."
O'Brien contacted Luskin after
hearing the audio tape.
"I am producing for Stanford
University and KTEH, the San Jose
public television station, a national
television program for PBS," she
said. "It is a lecture series with Fred.
Fred talks to a live studio audience,
and all the public stations use it for
their pledge drive."
The program, which is under
written by the Alliance for Life Long
Learning, will air in August. O'Brien
said that the skills that Luskin teach
es can help Americans forgive the
atrocities of Sept. 11.
"The reason we are doing it and,
one the reasons that Stanford wants
us to produce a national show about
it, is because it is [ so] important" now,
she said.
