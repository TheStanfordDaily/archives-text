# New studies look at forgiveness
## 
### GOHAR GALYAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To earn his doctorate in counseling and health psy
chology from Stanford in 1997, Fred Luskin had to
write a dissertation. At the time, Luskin was furious
with a friend. To complete his graduation require
ment and to cope with the pain, Luskin researched
and wrote about forgiveness.
"1 couldn't do it. I couldn't forgive," he said. "I was
badly hurt by a friend of mine and it threw my world
upside down."
Luskin, now a research associate with the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Prevention, focused on

Stanford students' experiences when he initially
began studying forgiveness. In 1999, after earning his
doctorate, Luskin launched the original Stanford For
giveness Project, which studied Bay Area residents.
According to Luskin, the study involved 260 partici
pants, including 100 men.
"The results were very positive," Luskin said. "Peo
ple showed less stress, less anger, more optimism and
more forgiveness."
Research is conducted in a workshop format and
typically lasts from five to six weeks, he said. In his re
search, he teaches forgiveness as a skill.
