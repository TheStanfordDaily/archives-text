Many researchers reject depression as
a biochemical aberration that can simply
be treated through drugs. But do anti-de
pressants permanently rewire your brain?
A majority of anti-depressants, such as
Prozac, enhance the production of sero
tonin, a molecule that reduces anxiety.
Scientists have two theories to explain this:
serotonin is believed either to encourage
neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells),
or to cause changes in existing neurons.
Increasing evidence suggests that both
explanations are valid. Scientists have
found that excess serotonin increases neu
rogenesis in rats but also causes brain ab
normalities— which might also be true
for humans.
Ever felt ovenvhelmed by the delicate
savor of dining hall hied chicken? Here's
how vou taste it:

1) The tongue has sensors for five dis
tinct tastes: bitter, sweet, salty, sour and
monosodium glutamate.
2) 70 percent of our sense of taste actu
ally comes from neurons lining the inner
surface of the nose. So maybe if I closed
my nose while eating the fried chick
en
3) Taste is strongest while exhaling: in
coming air disperses odor molecules into
the lungs, while exhaled air brings them in
contact with the sense organs.
How life began remains a mystery, but
Louis Allamandola and co-workers at a
California NASA research center tried to

find out. They recreated the conditions in
which our sun was born in outer space.
They mixed water, methanol, ammo
nia and carbon monoxide ices — and
flashed the solution with energy rays emit
ted by young stars. The surprising result:
approximately 2 percent of the frozen gas
was transformed into organic molecules.
When dipped in water, these molecules
instandy formed chambers similar to liv
ing cells, and some were able to capture
visible light.
Allamandola believes that self-replicat
ing molecules could have formed this way
and engendered life.
Proteins are responsible for everything
from digestion to infection. Their specific
function depends on how they fold to
gether. Los Alamos scientists used a non
traditional approach to understand pro
tein folding.

They purchased beads at the
local hardware store and tied
them in chains and knots of vary
ing lengths. Then they set them
on a vibrating surface and
watched as the chains wriggled
and untied. By analyzing the pat
terns of unfolding, they conclud
ed that it depended not on their
length, but on the way that they
were knotted.
This discovery could shed light
on how proteins can mis-fold, caus
ing diseases such as Alzheimer's.

With so much talk about carbon
dioxide emissions, deforestation,
pollution and global warming,
Swedish Saab engineer Eric Olofs
son and his colleagues decided to
do something about it: They de
signed Saab's new engine, which
consumes 10 percent less fuel, re
leases 10 percent less carbon diox
ide and has 75 percent lower emis
sion lor other pollutants.
The secret is a more fuel-effi
cient catalytic converter. Normally
this would increase production of
dangerous gases, but Olofsson
avoided the problem by maintain
ing the same air-to-fuel ratio in the
engine. The cylinders also used re
cycled exhaust gases, thus supply

ing themselves with the right
amount of air and fuel.
Hematologist Larry Corash and
partners have refined the blood col
lection process so that not a single
drop is wasted. They invented a
white plastic box called Helnix,
about three cybic feet in size, that
separates blood parts and irradiates
them with ultraviolet light.
Blood banks typically kill
white blood cells to avoid an im
mune rejection response. By irra
diating the blood with UV light,
Helnix does no harm to the re
maining three parts, but disables
any bacterial or viral particles in
the solution.
