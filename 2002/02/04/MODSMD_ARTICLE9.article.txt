Many researchers reject depression as
a biochemical aberration that can simply
be treated through drugs. But do anti-de
pressants permanently rewire your brain?
A majority of anti-depressants, such as
Prozac, enhance the production of sero
tonin, a molecule that reduces anxiety.
Scientists have two theories to explain this:
serotonin is believed either to encourage
neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells),
or to cause changes in existing neurons.
Increasing evidence suggests that both
explanations are valid. Scientists have
found that excess serotonin increases neu
rogenesis in rats but also causes brain ab
normalities— which might also be true
for humans.
Ever felt ovenvhelmed by the delicate
savor of dining hall hied chicken? Here's
how vou taste it:

1) The tongue has sensors for five dis
tinct tastes: bitter, sweet, salty, sour and
monosodium glutamate.
2) 70 percent of our sense of taste actu
ally comes from neurons lining the inner
surface of the nose. So maybe if I closed
my nose while eating the fried chick
en
3) Taste is strongest while exhaling: in
coming air disperses odor molecules into
the lungs, while exhaled air brings them in
contact with the sense organs.
How life began remains a mystery, but
Louis Allamandola and co-workers at a
California NASA research center tried to

find out. They recreated the conditions in
which our sun was born in outer space.
They mixed water, methanol, ammo
nia and carbon monoxide ices — and
flashed the solution with energy rays emit
ted by young stars. The surprising result:
approximately 2 percent of the frozen gas
was transformed into organic molecules.
When dipped in water, these molecules
instandy formed chambers similar to liv
ing cells, and some were able to capture
visible light.
Allamandola believes that self-replicat
ing molecules could have formed this way
and engendered life.
Proteins are responsible for everything
from digestion to infection. Their specific
function depends on how they fold to
gether. Los Alamos scientists used a non
traditional approach to understand pro
tein folding.
