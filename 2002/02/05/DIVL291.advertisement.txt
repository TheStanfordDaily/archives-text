Russia's Unfinished Revolution traces Russia's tumultuous political history from Gorbechav's rise to power in 1985 through
the 1999 resignation of Boris Yeltsin. McFaul divides his account of the post-Soviet country into three periods: the
Gorbechav Era (1985-1991), the First Russian Republic (1991-1993) and the Second Russian Republic (1993-present).
McFaul spent a great deal of time in Moscow in the 1990s and witnessed firsthand many of the events he describes. His
experience combined with frequent visits since and unparalleled access to senior Russian policy-makers and politicians, has
resulted in an astonishingly well-informed account. McFaul is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace and teaches Political Science at Stanford.
