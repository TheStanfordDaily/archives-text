# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Stanford should attract famous speakers 
### DAVID ROESKE ALEX BRADFORD GUEST COLUMNISTS 
As the blue and gold masses filled
UC-Berkeley's largest auditori
um and venomously hissed, we
defiantly cried, "Woohoo!!
Go Stanford!"
Governor Gray Davis looked up and
grinned. The auditorium was confound
ed and dismayed. Fora moment, we felt a
connection with the Governor, as he dis
tractedly scoped the crowd for the source
of the cheers.
Davis had just commended UC-Berke
ley's academic excellence hut noted the
irony of being a Stanford graduate. Al
though we were seated high in the nose
bleed section, our yells stupefied the un
suspecting Bears. We proudly braved the
hostile blue and gold masses, as we
thought we were the only two individuals
in the crowd with no false consciousness.
But we soon learned otherwise.
This past Tuesday former President
Bill Clinton, who was in the Bay Area to
raise money for Davis, Barbara Boxer,
and the Democratic National Committee,
received a roaring welcome at Berkeley,
where he gave an address on globaliza
tion. Responding to this welcome, Clinton
joked that it was"the nicest welcome ever
given to a Stanford parent."
Inspiring UC-Berkeley students into
action, Clinton proclaimed, "We've got to
spread the benefits and shrink the bur
dens" of globalization. "In a profound
sense," Clinton told the sold-out auditori
um 0f2,000 people, "Sept. 11 was the dark
side of the new age of globalization and all
of its benefits."

Clinton warned the audience, "If the
world is dominated by people who believe
that their races, their religions, their eth
nic differences are the most important fac
tors, then a huge number of people will
perish in this century."
As we listened to the former presidents
words, we wondered: Why didn't Stan
ford get Clinton? For that matter, why
does Stanford often fail to attract big name
speakers? In the last five years, the biggest
speaker to come to Stanford for a large
event was arguably Benazir Bhutto, for
mer Prime Minister of Pakistan â€” If not
Bhutto, then Woody Harrelson.
Backed by the support of UC-Berke
ley's student body, the dean of UC-Berke
ley's Graduate School of Journalism per
sonally invited Clinton.
But Stanford probably has better con
nections to prominent speakers than
UC-Berkeley. So what is lacking? Could
it be that the country club atmosphere of
Stanford has entrapped us in "The Bub
ble," rendering us ill-suited to inquire
and engage in events that address
global problems?
Although we first stepped onto the UC-
Berkeley campus last Tuesday with blind
Cardinal pride, our paradigms quickly
shifted as we realized how UC-Berkeley s
independent and engaged atmosphere
was well-suited for being a forum for the
former president's talk on globalization.
Stanford would do well to partake
more in the global maturity displayed by
UC-Berkeley.
