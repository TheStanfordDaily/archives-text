# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Left out in the cold: Theta Delt must follow frat-party rules 
### JULIE RUVOLO GUEST COLUMNIST 
Everyone knows that fraternities
follow certain rules. Even Stan
ford fiats, which are on the mar
gin of frattiness.
Rule number one: never make girls
you wouldn't mind hooking up with
wait in line to gel into your party. Rule
number two: never turn away a girl you
or your brothers wouldn't mind hook
ing up with.
Theta Delta Chi has broken both of
these rules.
Exhibit A: freshman year. Like most
freshman girls, I found my way to the

notorious Cave Party last year. And, like
most freshman girls, 1 walked to parties
in the dead of winter wearing not much
more than a tank top for fear that my
jacket would get stolen, or, more likely,
get Keystone Light spilled all over it. By
the time I made it from Lag to Theta
Delt, 1 was excited Stanford was really
having a party but also very cold.
Now, rule number one, which any
other housed frat on campus follows dic
tates that my friends and I should be let
into the party before we got too cranky
or cold and went instead to some hall
party in Flo Mo. But that frosty night at
Theta Delt, I was instead met by a guy in
a leopard print caveman suit waving a

club at me. He made me wait.
Some of you might really feeling bad
for me right about now. Poor Julie had
to wait to get into a party, and with no
jacket! Boohoo.
Hey — I didn't make up the rules.
I'm just saying rules need to be followed
for consistency's sake. Without rules, as
we learned in Introduction to American
Law,'society will spiral into chaos. And I
don't want that to happen to Stanford.
Exhibit B: Friday night, Theta Delt
had their annual Easy Groove, a closed
party with a band and a dress code.
Some of my friends were going over
early; my RAs decided to stop by later
and I came with them. As I approached

the "bouncer" I started to get an uneasy
feeling. He looked strangely like the
mussy brown-haired boy who had
donned the cave jumpsuit last year.
And to make matters worse, I hadn't
called anyone to put me on the list.
Never mind that I have friends at Theta
Delt; never mind my friends have
boyfriends in Theta Delt; never mind
my RAs had been invited earlier that
day; never mind the list was four pages
long. The guy did not let me in.
"Theta Delt does a lot for Stanford,"
he said. "This is just for us tonight."
Theta Delt had broken rule number
two: never turn away a girl you or your
brothers wouldn't mind hooking up

with — especially if she's friends with
them.
800 hoo, you say. Julie got turned
away from her first party!
Yeah, and non-athletes can't have the
spec ial food at Stern — it's not that bad.
So what is the deal with Theta Delt?
Let me rephrase that. There are plenty
of nice Theta Delts in the house (last
time I got in).
Why is this one guy being so inhos
pitable? Fire safety rules? Just ask Kappa
Sig; it's not that bad to be on probation.
Did the party reach the maximum c a
pacity of girls? 1 don't think so.
