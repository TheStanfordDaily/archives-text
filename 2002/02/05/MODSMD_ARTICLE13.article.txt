The phrase "home-field advantage" lings true
for many sports teams. But for the Cardinal men's
tennis team, it has a totally new meaning.

Saturday: No. 2 Stanford defeated No. 52
San Diego State, 6-1.

With a 6-1 thumping of 52nd-ranked San Diego
State (2-1) last Saturday, No. 2 Stanford (1-0)
opened the 2002 season by capturing its 73rd con
secutive home match victory, a streak that dates all
the way back to April 6, 1996.
"[The winning streak] is something that's always
been a motivating factor," said senior K.J. Hippen
steel. "We don't want to be known as the guys who
lost the streak. We can't control who's going to win
or lose, but if the other team wants to win, they're
going to have to earn it. That's the attitude we bring
to every match."
The match was never in question as Stanford
players won four out of the five singles matches in
straight sets.
Especially impressive was top-ranked Hippen
steel's season debut. He (7-0) faced off against a
tough opponent in No. 11 Oliver Maiberger. Re
spite Maiberger's solid shots, Hippensteel s were
even better as he ousted the German native in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-3. The pair played each other
once before during the fall season, when Hippen
steel came out on top in the quarterfinals of the ITA
.All-American on Oct. 13.
Manning the No. 2 through No. 4 positions were
the three juniors on the squad: No. 49 David Martin
(7-3), No. 31 Scott Lipsky (11-6) arid No. 43 Ryan
Haviland (9-3). The three will be counted on heavi

ly this season to be consistent in the middle of the
lineup, and they seemed up to the challenge in their
first match of the season.
Martin, at the No. 2 position, played a strong
game, defeating a very difficult opponent in Valenti
no Pest, 6-3,6-2.
The lone Stanford loss came at No. 3, when Lip
sky never gained control of the match and fell to
Felix Hardt, 6-3, 6-2.
Haviland, the Cardinal's No. 4 player for the
match, made quick work of Travis Hasson with a 6-
4,6-1 victory.
Tennis fans were able to catch a glimpse of the
future with freshmen Phil Sheng (5-3) and No.
90 Sam Warburg (9-5) playing at Nos. 5 and 6 for
Stanford. With junior Carter Morris out for the
quarter due to illness, the team is looking for
both freshmen to step up in the early portion of
the season.
And step up they did.
Sheng played a very composed match against
Gabe Coren and disposed of him in straight sets, 6-
3, 7-6. Warburg, had a little more difficulty with his
opponent, Khlaid Naffa, but showed poise and
managed a three-set victory, 6-1,4-6,6-2.

an 8-5 victory over Corean / Pest.
The Cardinal's next stop will

the weekend. While Stanford will

the way back to April 6, 1996.
"[The winning streak] is something that's always
been a motivating factor," said senior K.J. Hippen
steel. "We don't want to be known as the guys who
lost the streak. We can't control who's going to win
or lose, but if the other team wants to win, they're
going to have to earn it. That's the attitude we bring
to every match."
The match was never in question as Stanford
players won four out of the five singles matches in
straight sets.
Especially impressive was top-ranked Hippen
steel's season debut. He (7-0) faced off against a
tough opponent in No. 11 Oliver Maiberger. Re
spite Maiberger's solid shots, Hippensteel s were
even better as he ousted the German native in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-3. The pair played each other
once before during the fall season, when Hippen
steel came out on top in the quarterfinals of the ITA
.All-American on Oct. 13.
Manning the No. 2 through No. 4 positions were
the three juniors on the squad: No. 49 David Martin
(7-3), No. 31 Scott Lipsky (11-6) arid No. 43 Ryan
Haviland (9-3). The three will be counted on heavi

ly this season to be consistent in the middle of the
lineup, and they seemed up to the challenge in their
first match of the season.
Martin, at the No. 2 position, played a strong
game, defeating a very difficult opponent in Valenti
no Pest, 6-3,6-2.
The lone Stanford loss came at No. 3, when Lip
sky never gained control of the match and fell to
Felix Hardt, 6-3, 6-2.
Haviland, the Cardinal's No. 4 player for the
match, made quick work of Travis Hasson with a 6-
4,6-1 victory.
Tennis fans were able to catch a glimpse of the
future with freshmen Phil Sheng (5-3) and No.
90 Sam Warburg (9-5) playing at Nos. 5 and 6 for
Stanford. With junior Carter Morris out for the
quarter due to illness, the team is looking for
both freshmen to step up in the early portion of
the season.
And step up they did.
Sheng played a very composed match against
Gabe Coren and disposed of him in straight sets, 6-
3, 7-6. Warburg, had a little more difficulty with his
opponent, Khlaid Naffa, but showed poise and
managed a three-set victory, 6-1,4-6,6-2.

not be able to bask in the com
forts of its home turf, not every
thing will be unfamiliar as it faces
off against the Aztecs again this
weekend in the first round.
