WOMEN'S TENNIS
Thursday: No. 1 Stanford defeated
Pacific 7-0.
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford defeated No.
24 Pepperdine 5-2.

At home on Thursday, Stanford easily
dispatched the Tigers, 7-0, before travel
ing to Malibu on Saturday, where they de
feated the Waves 5-2.
"As a team, we're meshing really well,"
senior Keiko Tokuda said. "Everyone's got
the right idea."
Although the Cardinal had little trouble
notching two victories this past weekend,
the team had to do so without their top
ranked player. Senior Lauren Kalvaria,

ranked fourth in the nation for singles, was
unable to play singles last weekend, due to
a virus that has affected her vision.
"Everyone's a little nervous about it,"
freshman Erin Burdette saicl.
Kalvaria, who forms, with No. 11 senior
Gabriela Lastra, the nation's top doubles
tandem, moved down to play No. 3 dou
bles against both opponents.
Against UOP, the Cardinal lost only six
games in their doubles matches and 18
games in their singles matches.
In singles action, Lastra outlasted
UOP's No. 103 Susanne Bertel, 2-6,6-1, 6-
2. Sophomore No. 42 Lauren Barnikow
put away Katharina Heil, 6-2, 6-2, and No.
10 Burdette handled Melinda Kocsis, 6-1,
6-1. No. 52 Tokuda prevailed over Urska
Dvorsek, 6-0, 6-1.
Sophomore Emilia Anderson highlight
ed the singles competition by shutting out
Jaimee Bremner, 6-0, 6-0, and freshman
Story Tweedie-Yates defeated Lisa Lester,
6-1,6-1.
In doubles, the Cardinal easily won the
team point.
Barnikow and Burdette beat Bertel and
Heil 8-1 in first flight doubles. Lastra and
Tokuda, who last played doubles together
two years ago, had little trouble getting in
synch, heating Bremner and
kocsis 8-3. Anderson and
Ralvaria outplayed Dvorsek and
Lester, 8-2.
"Everyone was pleased [with
the team's play]," Burdette said.
Against Pepperdine, the Car
dinal knew it would have a much
tougher time, and it rose to the
challenge.
"Pepperdine's always kind of
tricky," Tokuda explained. "Two
years ago, we had a really close
match with them."
Pepperdine is hard to scout, be
cause eight of its nine team mem
bers are international students.
Nonetheless, in singles, Lastra
withstood a tough opponent in
Charlotte Vernaz, coming back
to win in three sets, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Barnikow lell in another tough
match to Aleksandra Kujawska, 7-
5, 7-6 (6). Yates, in the sixth flight,
lost to Anna Andersson, 6-0,7-6 (3).
The Cardinal won flights 3-5,
though, giving them four of the

six singles points. Burdette had
little trouble with Karin Schlap
bach, winning 6-1, 6-2. Tokuda
was up one set (6-0) on Veronica
Koskova before her opponent
retired, and Anderson took out
Moriika Horvath, 6-4, 6-1.
In doubles, Barnikow and
Burdette shut out Kujawska and
Schlapbach, 8-0. Lastra and
Tokuda defeated Vernaz and
Ceyda Keyman, 8-3, and Ander
son and Kalvaria easily beat
Koskova and Andersson, 8-1.
This weekend, Stanford trav
els to Madison, Wise., for the
feam Indoors, a 16-school team
tournament.
"All the top teams are right
there together," Burdette said.
"It's a really good preview for the
rest of the year."
I'he challenge is unlikely to
faze the Cardinal, which has
adapted remarkably well to the
necessity of players at different
singles positions and in unusual
doubles combinations.
"All we can do right now is get
the job done individually and see
how things fall into place,"
Tokuda said.
