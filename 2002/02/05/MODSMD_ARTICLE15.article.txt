Stanford swept through Friday's meet at the Sunset

events. Senior co-captain Jessica Foschi led the team
with wins in the 200 (1:49.12) and 500 freestyle
(5:01.32) events. Foschi clocked in a season best in the
200 freestyle, a good sign of steady improvement as the
NCAA Championships in March near.
Freshman Lacey Boutwell had a pair solid wins
in the 100 freestyle (50.33) and 200 1M (2:03.84),
while senior co-captain Shelly Ripple won the 200
butterfly (1:59.52).
Freshman Evins Cameron notched her first colle
giate victory, capturing first place in the 1000 freestyle
with a time of 10:13.28. Tara Kirk rounded out the
wins with a victory in the 200 breaststroke (2:13.74).
The relay team of sophomore Haley Champion,
freshman Kirsten Gilbert, Ripple and Boutwell won
the 200 medley relay (1:44.09).
The divers had an impressive showing as well Junior

The Cardinal victories continued on Saturday at the
McDonald's Swim Stadium in Los Angeles. This meet
was particularly challenging because freshman Amy
Wagner suffered an injury Friday night that left the
Cardinal one swimmer short.
"I think the fact that we stayed strong despite com
peting without one of our top backstrokers shows the
kind of character our team has," Kirk said. "We learned
last year that having great team chemistry can make all
the difference at NCAAs."
Ripple led the team with victories in the 200 butter

fly (1:56.92), 200 backstroke (1:58.99) and 400 IM
(4:17.01). She remains unbeaten this year in the 200

For the third time in four meets, Boutwell also picked
up three individual victories in the 100 freestyle (49.38),
200 freestyle (1:48.19) and 100 butterfly (53.82).
Boutwell's season-best times Saturday in the 100
freestyle and 100 butterfly met the NCAA "A" standard.
Foschi, the reigning NCAA champion in the 500
freestyle, had her 17th straight victory in the event
(4:50.67). She also captured the 1650 freestyle
(16:36.89). Kirk won the 100 breastroke (1:00.19) and
200 breaststroke (2:12.95).
"I never want to take for granted the great and
consistent job that Jessica Foschi, Shelly Ripple and
Tara Kirk always do," head coach Richard Quick said.
Stanford won both relay events. Sophomore
Megan Baumgartner, Kirk, Ripple and freshman
Sarah Jones swept the 400 medley relay (3:42.20).
The 400 freestyle relay team of Boutwell, Jones, ju
nior Sara Watchorn and Foschi (3:24.87) also notched
a victory as they turned in the Cardinal's best perfor
mance in the event this season.

Tara Kirk turned in a win in the 200 breaststroke Friday
against USC as the team notched a weekend sweep.
" The weekend went very well
for us," Foschi said. "Obviously,
two wins is what we wanted out of
the weekend, but in addition to
that, many girls on the team im
proved upon their performances
from earlier in the season, so
thing's are looking very good for
us light now."
The Trojans' three wins were in
the 50 freestyle, 100 backstroke and
the one-meter diving competition.
"The meets went very well this
weekend," Ripple said. "I am so
proud of our team. Everyone is im

for the N(AAs. Nothing is a sure
thing, but this team has a great atti

goals — that is how 1 know that we

NCAA Championships in March near.

the difference at NCAAs."
