# Pats do it for underdogs everywhere
## 
### 
In case anyone reading this column
was in Uzbekistan for the weekend,
on Sunday, the 14-point underdog
New England Patriots defeated the
St. Louis Rams, 20-17, to win Super
Bowl XXXVI in what had to be one of
the most amazing games I have ever
seen. Sure, there have probably been
better-played games in the long history
of football, but on such a grand stage as
the Super Bowl rarely, if ever, do two
teams put on a performance like the Pats
and Rams did in New Orleans.
With Adam Vinatieri's beyond-clutch
48-yard Held goal splitting the uprights
as time expired, the Pats found a way to
derail the supposedly Greatest Show on
Earth and succeed in becoming, at least
in my book, the epitome of what is great
about sports.
In the week leading up to the big
game, none of the so-called experts
gave them a chance in hell. Oddsmak
ers laid it to them, deeming them two
touchdown underdogs just one week
after the team marched into Pittsburgh
and beat the Steelers at Heinz Field to
capture the AFC crown. Even Madison
Avenue disrespected them, as advertis
ing prices went down for the highly
vaulted 30-second commercial spots.

Everyone assumed
that Rams would run
them out of the build
ing as soon as Mariah
Carey finished the Na
tional Anthem (which,
by the way, wasn't as
bad as I thought it
would be, although I
could have done with-

out the supersonic ending that only
dogs could hear).
Not everyone ignored the Patriots'
chances of winning the game, but it
seemed as if none of these people knew
enough about the game to write for
ESPN.com or the San Francisco Chron
icle. Now I don't mean to toot my own
horn, but I would like to disclose that
not only did yours truly bet on the Pa
triots with the 14-point spread, but I
also put down a wager that the Pats
would win by a l-to-5 point margin at
10:1 odds. Needless to say, I made a
pretty penny.
After that little ego-boost of a di
gression, I'd like to explain just why it
is so great that the Pats pulled off one
of the most spectacular upsets in Super
Bowl history.
As the team was seemingly cast aside

and, even worse, mocked for being
such lowly competition all week, none
of the Patriots opened their months
and said anything stupid, as far as pre
dictions go.
They knew they had a great shot at
winning, and they couldn't give a rat's
ass if anyone else realized it. They
were there to do business. There were
no egos or battling for the spotlight.
With a team chock full of unheralded,
blue-collar, former cast-offs, the Pats
arrived in New Orleans as one unit
ready to punch in their time card and
go to work.
As the team took the field Sunday
evening, the players did the unthinkable
in today's day and age â€” they put the
team before themselves in actions, not
merely in words. On the ultimate center
stage, where the game's starters are an
nounced one-by-one, usually sauntering
onto the field with their arms extended
to the heavens as if to declare their
stature as God's gift to sports, the Patriot
starters refused to be singularly an
nounced. Instead, the entire team ran
onto the Superdome field in the ultimate
display of true team spirit.

As the game progressed, and
the New England defense contin
ually punished the Rams re
ceivers coming across the middle,
that heart and spirit showed up
once again.
On Sunday, the game was won
in the middle of the field on those
crossing routes, when the Rams just
couldn't muster the courage and
wherewithal needed to weather t he
storm of the New England sec
ondary's blistering hits. Each time a
Ram caught the ball, it seemed as il
all 11 Patriots converged to make
the tackle, sticking the speedsters
between the numbers and jarring a
number of balls loose.
Patriots safety Lawyer Milloy
pointed out in the post-game show,
that there's never been a 100-meter
sprinter that's had to run with a cou
ple guys in front of him jamming
him in his facemask. And that's ex
acdy what showed on Sunday.
Football is not a track contest or
a game of numbers strictly played

out on paper. Some things don't
show up in the box score, like
heart, and those are often what
make up the difference between
winning and losing. When the
Rams stormed back in the fourth
quarter with fourteen straight
points, the Patriots' resolve never
wavered a bit, as the team sur
prised most observers by choosing
not to sit on the ball but to go for
the kill instead.
As Vinatieri strode onto the
Held and nailed that game-win
ning Held goal (looking as if he just
stepped off the Andrea Gail be
fore jumping into his uniform)
you couldn't help but feel good
about the Patriots' so-called upset
over the Rams.
Anyone that's ever been ignored
or overlooked in any aspect of life,
the Patriots, as a team, embodied
the big "F@%K you" that you
wished you could so eloquently
have delivered to all of your critic s
and all the naysayers. And that just
feels good to see.
