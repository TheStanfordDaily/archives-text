# Pats do it for underdogs everywhere
## 
### 
In case anyone reading this column
was in Uzbekistan for the weekend,
on Sunday, the 14-point underdog
New England Patriots defeated the
St. Louis Rams, 20-17, to win Super
Bowl XXXVI in what had to be one of
the most amazing games I have ever
seen. Sure, there have probably been
better-played games in the long history
of football, but on such a grand stage as
the Super Bowl rarely, if ever, do two
teams put on a performance like the Pats
and Rams did in New Orleans.
With Adam Vinatieri's beyond-clutch
48-yard Held goal splitting the uprights
as time expired, the Pats found a way to
derail the supposedly Greatest Show on
Earth and succeed in becoming, at least
in my book, the epitome of what is great
about sports.
In the week leading up to the big
game, none of the so-called experts
gave them a chance in hell. Oddsmak
ers laid it to them, deeming them two
touchdown underdogs just one week
after the team marched into Pittsburgh
and beat the Steelers at Heinz Field to
capture the AFC crown. Even Madison
Avenue disrespected them, as advertis
ing prices went down for the highly
vaulted 30-second commercial spots.

Everyone assumed
that Rams would run
them out of the build
ing as soon as Mariah
Carey finished the Na
tional Anthem (which,
by the way, wasn't as
bad as I thought it
would be, although I
could have done with-

out the supersonic ending that only
dogs could hear).
Not everyone ignored the Patriots'
chances of winning the game, but it
seemed as if none of these people knew
enough about the game to write for
ESPN.com or the San Francisco Chron
icle. Now I don't mean to toot my own
horn, but I would like to disclose that
not only did yours truly bet on the Pa
triots with the 14-point spread, but I
also put down a wager that the Pats
would win by a l-to-5 point margin at
10:1 odds. Needless to say, I made a
pretty penny.
After that little ego-boost of a di
gression, I'd like to explain just why it
is so great that the Pats pulled off one
of the most spectacular upsets in Super
Bowl history.
As the team was seemingly cast aside

and, even worse, mocked for being
such lowly competition all week, none
of the Patriots opened their months
and said anything stupid, as far as pre
dictions go.
They knew they had a great shot at
winning, and they couldn't give a rat's
ass if anyone else realized it. They
were there to do business. There were
no egos or battling for the spotlight.
With a team chock full of unheralded,
blue-collar, former cast-offs, the Pats
arrived in New Orleans as one unit
ready to punch in their time card and
go to work.
As the team took the field Sunday
evening, the players did the unthinkable
in today's day and age â€” they put the
team before themselves in actions, not
merely in words. On the ultimate center
stage, where the game's starters are an
nounced one-by-one, usually sauntering
onto the field with their arms extended
to the heavens as if to declare their
stature as God's gift to sports, the Patriot
starters refused to be singularly an
nounced. Instead, the entire team ran
onto the Superdome field in the ultimate
display of true team spirit.
