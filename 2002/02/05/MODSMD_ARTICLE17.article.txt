Conference) won 18-of-20 bouts
on Friday, shutting Nevada out
47-0 in the first match before han
dling Pac-10 foe Cal State Fuller
ton 34-9 later that day.
The Cardinal's success against
the Wolfpack included the promis
ing return of sophomore Nathan
Peterson, who recorded a 10-1
major decision over Jeff Wash
burn at 125 pounds in his first bout
since injuring his finger on Jan. 5.
Senior Levi Weikel-Magden

started the Cardinal romp with a
16-2 major decision at 157
pounds. Sophomore John
Garfinkel followed with a close 2-1
decision at 165 pounds to put
Stanford ahead 7-0.
Freshman Imad Kharbush in
vigorated the home crowd with a
pin in the next bout to even his
dual meet record at 7-7 and put
the Cardinal up 13-0.
Stanford sandwiched a tough 9-
8 decision by Matt Twomey in be
tween two Nevada forfeits to in
crease its lead over the over
matched first year program.
With its lead well out of Neva
da's reach, the Cardinal did not let
up in the second half of the match.
Following Peterson's major deci

his tenth dual meet win with a
major decision at 133 pounds and

"Any time your team goes
through some hard times like we
have the past few years, it's always
great to be on the other end of a
thrashing," Buddie said. "To have
10 guys in your lineup win is a
great feeling, regardless of the
quality of the opponent."
Against the Titans, Weikel-Mag
den started the Cardinal off on the
right foot again. His 10-3 decision
was the first of three straight Stan
ford wins to start the match.
After a forfeit gave Garfinkel his
second win of the day, Kharbush

two bouts en route to Stanford's
second win of the day and ninth

Saturday, as about half the team
competed at the California Colle
giate Invitational. The Cardinal
placed five wrestlers overall with
Gentry and Weikel-Magden cap
turing individual championships.
Weikel-Magden went 4-0, culmi
nating with a 7-6 decision in the final
round, to capture his first tourna
