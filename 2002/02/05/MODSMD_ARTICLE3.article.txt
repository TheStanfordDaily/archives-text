# Prison experiment repeated for ratings
## 
### ELLIE RITCH STAFF WRITER 
If a psychology study claimed
it would "change the way you
think" for the rest of your life,
would you do it? Fifteen volun
teers for the British Broadcasting

Corporation's
latest reality
show took a risk
to know them
selves better,
and ended up
imprisoned.
The BBC's
new show is
called "The Ex-

periment" and is modeled after
the famous Stanford Prison Ex
periment conducted by Stanford
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo.
Zimbardo's 1971 study was
aborted early when several vol
unteers displayed signs of mental
disturbance and one prisoner de
veloped a psychosomatic rash.
After his study was terminated
preemptively, Zimbardo vowed

that the prison experiment would
never be repeated.
" There is no reason to repli
cate the study without new rea
sons for uncovering valuable in
formation about human nature,"
Zimbardo said.
The TV study will be conduct
ed by Exeter University Psycholo
gy Prof. Alex Haslam and St. An
drews University Prof. Stephen
Reicher. They admit their exper
iment is based on the Stanford
Prison Study but say that it also
draws on important psychologi
cal issues Zimbardo's study did
not address.
'"The Experiment' is con
cerned with how domination
works and also with resistance to
inequality," said Reicher.
Reicher and Haslam ran the
experiment for the BBC in a west
London sound studio they con
verted into a temporary prison.
Zimbardo, who is currently
president-elect of the American


Zimbardo
Psychology Association, was contact
ed by Haslam and Reicher in the
hopes he would advise them on
running the experiment. He re
fused as a result of what he has
learned since 1971.
"The power of such situations
makes good people engage in evil
behavior," said Zimbardo. "Role
playing can become a new reality
in which people suffer mentally
and physically."
According to Zimbardo, the
BBC was convinced the show
would be a hit and ignored his
warnings.
The 15 participants were split
up into groups of prisoners and
guards lor ten days in January, and
warned they would be faced with
exercise, hardships, hunger, soli
tude and anger.
The BBC production team did
agree with Zimbardo's request to
have an around-the-clock exter

nal committee given the power to
terminate the experiment. The
newspaper The Guardian report
ed the committee discontinued
the study a day early, as the pris
oners were showing signs of harm
to their physical and emotional
well-being.
Even if the study was cut short by
one day, Haslam said their data was
not affected.
"We were able to collect an enor
mous amount of qualitative and
quantitative data and the story it
tells is fascinating, complex and im
portant," Haslam said.
Yet many psychologists, in
cluding Zimbardo, believe
made-for-television experi
ments are not capable of produc
ing accurate data or displaying
social realities.
"The Heisenberg Indetermi
nacy Principle is working here,"
Zimbardo said. "Knowing they
were being filmed changed the
nature of what was being
filmed, so there can be no valid
conclusions drawn."
In "Survivor"-type reality

shows, participants often volunteer
in the hopes of becoming actors
and thus "perform" for the camera
rather than displaying their nor
mal social behaviorsm, according
to Zimbardo.
"Everyone knows the purpose of
surviving is to become a celebrity,"
Zimbardo said.
Junior Michael Osofsky, a psy
chology major, believes a show
like "The Experiment" is destined
to be unethical.
"It's voyeurism to the extreme,"
said Osofsky. "When scientists
doing it for educational purposes
would shut the experiment down,
TV would keep going for the rat
ings. 1 don't know if that can be
fully ethical."
The BBC will run five 50-
minute installments of "The Ex
periment" in the spring. The pro
ducers and all parties involved are
ordered not to talk about the con
tents of the show.
Therefore, it's unknown
whether Stanford or Zimbardo's
past experiment will be men
tioned on air.
