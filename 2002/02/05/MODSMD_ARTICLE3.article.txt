# Prison experiment repeated for ratings

### ELLIE RITCH STAFF WRITER 
If a psychology study claimed
it would "change the way you
think" for the rest of your life,
would you do it? Fifteen volun
teers for the British Broadcasting

Corporation's
latest reality
show took a risk
to know them
selves better,
and ended up
imprisoned.
The BBC's
new show is
called "The Ex-

periment" and is modeled after
the famous Stanford Prison Ex
periment conducted by Stanford
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo.
Zimbardo's 1971 study was
aborted early when several vol
unteers displayed signs of mental
disturbance and one prisoner de
veloped a psychosomatic rash.
After his study was terminated
preemptively, Zimbardo vowed

that the prison experiment would
never be repeated.
" There is no reason to repli
cate the study without new rea
sons for uncovering valuable in
formation about human nature,"
Zimbardo said.
The TV study will be conduct
ed by Exeter University Psycholo
gy Prof. Alex Haslam and St. An
drews University Prof. Stephen
Reicher. They admit their exper
iment is based on the Stanford
Prison Study but say that it also
draws on important psychologi
cal issues Zimbardo's study did
not address.
'"The Experiment' is con
cerned with how domination
works and also with resistance to
inequality," said Reicher.
Reicher and Haslam ran the
experiment for the BBC in a west
London sound studio they con
verted into a temporary prison.

president-elect of the American
