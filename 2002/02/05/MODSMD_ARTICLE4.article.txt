â€¢Stanford offers a number of
programs for students interested
in entering the dot-com industry
or medical school, but what about
students seeking Hollywood star
dom? For these budding directors,
writers and producers, the Stan
ford Film Society is stepping in to
fill the void of film production
classes by sponsoring a weekly
seminar on screenwriting. The
class met for the first time on
Wednesday, Jan. 30.
"The first half of the class is a
formal lecture," said sophomore
Kalilah Robinson, co-president of
the society. "For the rest of class,
we read other people's work and
workshop it."
According to Robinson, about
one-third of the class has already
written at least one full-length
screenplay in their own free time.
However, no experience is neces

sary to take the class.
I lie class offers students the op
portunity to create new scenes,
peer-edit and revise their work.
"1 have written screenplays for
movies I have made myself, but
writing a screenplay for someone
else is a completely different skill,"
said senior Matt Brutocao.
Brutocao said that while Stan
ford has a strong drama depart
ment and has recently instituted a
film studies minor, a void still exists.
"For film production, there is
absolutely nothing," he said.
According to Communica
tion Prof. Henry Breitrose, stu
dents do not understand "how
poorly screenwriting fits into
the structured undergraduate
academic curriculum."
Screenwriting for undergradu
ates has never been offered
through the department, although
Breitrose has participated in some
individually directed studies.
" Ihe results were mixed,"
said Breitrose. "My experience
was that undergraduates find it
[hard] to understand how very
difficult and time-consuming it
is to write even the first draft of
a screenplay."

According to film society board
members, student demand for
their class was overwhelming.
"We were deluged with over 65
requests to be in the class," said se
nior Sebastian Davis, a society
board member.
The first priority for entrance
into the class went to board
members who had helped orga
nize the class.
"After that, there was an open
invitation to everyone on the film
society e-mail list, and they were
selected by a random lottery,"
Davis said.
The guest lecturer leading the
course is Tabitha Allen, a Colum
bia University film school gradu
ate. At Columbia, Allen studied
under Paul Schrader, the screen
writer for the films "Taxi Driver"
and "Raging Bull."
"The first class went fine,"
said Davis.
But Robinson said she was ex
pecting more.
"A lot of us did not really like
the original lecture," Robinson
said. "It is still an experimental
workshop program, and we will
decide at the end of the quarter if
we want to bring it back.
