eral key aspects of U.S. foreign poli
cy about Afghanistan," said senior
Irem Sateen, president of Muslim
Students Awareness Network.
Barhoum stressed the need
for strong leadership in both
the U.S. and Afghanistan in re
building Afghanistan, con
demned hate-crimes directed
toward Muslims and Arabs and
criticized American news cover
age of the war.
Barhoum also condemned
the events of Sept. 11. "In prin
ciple, 9-11 should be con
demned no matter what. Mus
lims should be the first to con
demn the acts if Muslims were
responsible," he said.
Benjamin, who had recently
returned from a ten-day trip to

Afghanistan, spoke about the sit
uation of the civilians, and partic
ularly of women, in Afghanistan.
She asked why the U.S. is so
generous in spending money
toward the bombing campaign
but so miserly in helping the
new government.
"Three days of bombing could
have provided enough monetary
support for the new govern
ment," Benjamin said.
Benjamin also addressed the
position of women in Afghanistan
today. She said that not much has
changed for women in Afghanistan
since the Taliban was overthrown.
"About 99.5% of women still
wear burkas because they feel in
secure. While they are delighted
that schools are open once again,
many of the poor women are in
desperate need of jobs and have
resorted to begging on the
street," Benjamin said.
In order to improve the situa

tion all Afghans, Benjamin
stressed that Afghan non-gov
ernmental organizations needed
monetary support. She has
asked the U.S. government to set
up a compensation fund. In the
meantime, Global Exchange has
set up an Afghan Victim's Fund.
Noorzoy's speech focused on
the issue of why the U.S. went to
war in Afghanistan and how they
work for reconstruction.
According to Noorzoy, the pri
mary reason why the U.S. went to
war in Afghanistan was to fight
terrorism. But since the war
began, new goals have risen.
"Now the U.S. may have to
fight insecurity, instability and
poverty in Afghanistan," he said.
"In rebuilding Afghanistan,
the U.S. must survey the needs of
the people and the economy in
Afghanistan," Noorzoy said.
The emphasis on those suffer
ing in Afghanistan was one of the

goals that \ISAN hoped to
achieve through the panel.
"Thousands of Afghans were
made homeless alter the attacks,
and many more have been
abused by the Taliban. But since
we live so distant from these peo
ple, it is hard for us to sympathize
and relate," said Mohammed Ab
doolcarim, vice president of
MSAN.
"We hope to bring the lives of
these people a little closer to us so
that we may be able to see a dif
ferent point of view," he said.
Calvin Miaw, co-coordinator
of SCPJ, said that he hoped
that this panel would "create a
space for open dialogue about
U.S. policy, both domestic and
international, regarding the
war on terrorism."
MSAN and SCI'J have worked
together in the past, including on
the recent issue of proposed
restion of student visas.
