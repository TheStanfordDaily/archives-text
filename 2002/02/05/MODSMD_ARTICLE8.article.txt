Roizen and Judy Estrin spoke [an. Hi
and Jan. 23 at the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders Seminar. They
shared their career experiences with
students and discussed the search for
venture capital funding.
Roizen, the managing director of
Mobius Venture Capital, described
the qualifications needed to secure
funding for starting a company.
"1 am a people person," Roizen
said. "I look a lot for people who are
doing it for the light reasons, who
have a passion, who have an ethical
foundation, and then a dedication to
absolutely, positively making sure
their company is going to be
successful."
A venture capital firm is not a bank,
but rather a partner in the success of a
company.
"We primarily do early-stage [in

vestment], somewhere between two
and live million dollars," Roizen said.
"We're usually the lead [investor], so
we're defining the terms of the round.
I sit on the board of the company, 1
serve on the audit committee, I help
the [chief executive officer]."
When entrepreneurs search for
funding, it is essential to seek venture
capital firms who share a similar vi
sion and ideals, according to Roizen.
However, before such a search can
begin, one needs an idea.
"Make sure what you're going to
work on is something that — if you
build it right — someone will want,"
Roizen said. "Spend time with the peo
ple who would be potential users of it."
"But there are people who don't
know what they want. As it relates to
core technologies, I think you just
have to have faith something will
change the market, and ultimately
it does."
Estrin, currently president and
CEO of Packet Design, shared tips

from her long and successful career as
an entrepreneur.
"It is not easy. You have to really be
passionate and have a good idea [of
funding]," Estrin said. "There was a
period when people thought anyone
could go out and start a company."
That time is over, but people with
great ideas will still get funded.
"We are currently planning to in
vest some $500 million," Roizen said.
Having ties with a major research
university such as Stanford also offers
advantages. Both Estrin and Roizen
have worked with Stanford through
out their careers.
"I've worked with universities
many times," Estrin said. "Stanford
was one of the early users of our video
steaming."
Roizen has been an entrepreneur,
CEO, corporate executive, and most
recently a corporate director and ven
ture capitalist to leading technology
companies. She is also a member
of Stanford's Alumni Trustee
Nominating Committee.
Judy Estrin has co-founded
three technology companies
with her husband, Bill Carrico.
She worked with Bridge Com
munications, Network Comput
ing Devices, Precept Software
and was Cisco's chief'technology
officer from 1998 to 2000.
During her two years as Cisco
CI O, Estrin was twice named to
Fortune Magazine's list of the 50
most powerful women in Ameri
can business.
Estrin sits on the boards of di
rectors of the Walt Disney Com
pany, the Federal Express Cor
poration and the computer cop
many Sun Microsystems.
