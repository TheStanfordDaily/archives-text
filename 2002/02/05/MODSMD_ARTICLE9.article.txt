## The 						Stanford Daily Fire marshal should be reasonable with student groups 
### 
Published Since 1891

For many student groups, there is
nothing more critical than the need
to have their own meeting space. In
every sector of activities — from
Greek organizations to publications to ser
vice clubs — group-specific space plays a
key role in establishing the group's sense of
identity. Of course, there are drawbacks to
occupying space, but for the most part,
groups with physical resources tend to
nave stronger membership, more continu
ity and a stronger finished product than
their unhoused counterparts.
However, having meeting space is a priv
ilege that brings along responsibilities.
Foremost, groups must make an effort to
ensure that they are indeed using their
spaces to contribute to the greater commu
nity of the University. At the same time,
these groups must ensure that their spaces
are maintained in a safe and legal manner.

It is important that the Office of the
Fire Marshal work with student groups to
make sure that space is used safely. But it
is also important to ensure that groups
do not spend all of their time complying
with regulations.
Recentlv, the Fire Marshal has conduct
ed several inspections of student group
spaces, discovering a panoply of fire code
infractions. Some of the offenses are minor,
but some will require extensive work to
bring the spaces up to code. In addition,
the Fire Marshal has made a practice of in
specting the newly-occupiea Band Shak
on a weekly basis.
Certain fraternities have been fined
thousands of dollars for code infractions
discovered by recent inspections. Others
were put on activity suspension, at least in
part for their transgressions against the
laws of fire safety.

For the most part, student groups an
swer to the Office of Student Activities. But
in terms of physical space, the Fire Mar
shal has become the higher authority.
Even if a student group or the OSA be
lieved that a particular code were silly or
inapplicable, the Fire Marshal has the au
thority to close the space until the violation
has been rectified.
In the face of complicated campus poli
tics and complex space-allocation issues,
the Fire Marshal has an incredible power:
the power of non-compromise.
Of course, such authority is arguably ap
propriate given that people's lives could be
at stake. It would be ridiculous if a building
burned down because the particular
group occupying it decided they only
wanted to buy half a fire extinguisher.
While we laud the Fire Marshal's office
for putting safety first, they must also take

an understanding tack with student
groups. The fire codes of California obvi
ously weren't crafted with a Band Shak in
mind. While the laws are the laws, the tire
Marshal has a large amount of discretion in
choosing what to cite.
Having worked with them, we recognize
that the people in the Fire Marshal's office
truly care about student safety and have
good intentions in what they do. But we
hope their office will remember that the
space exists to serve the group, not the
group to serve the space.
The University allocates space to stu
dent groups so that they can make a con
tribution to the community, not so that
they can meticulously follow an arcane set
of rules. When excessive space inspection
and maintenance takes such a toll on a
group that its primary mission is impaired,
something has gone quite wrong.
