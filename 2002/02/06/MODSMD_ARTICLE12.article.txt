# Pearl kidnappers might be known

### 
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) —
Puffing on a cigar from behind
his imposing glass-top desk, the
Pakistani government's point
man in the investigation into the
kidnapping of Daniel Pearl yes
terday said the Wall Street Jour
nal reporter's abductors are
known and it's a matter of days
before they are found.
Mukhtar Ahmed Sheikh, in
charge of police here in Sindh
province, refused to say who
was behind the kidnapping.
Pearl, 88, was last seen Jan. 23
on his way to meet a Muslim
fundamentalist contact at a
Karachi restaurant.
"The fact is we know who has
done it and we are very close to
resolving the case," Sheikh told
the Associated Press.
"There are questions which,
if I answer, could affect the
case," he added. "But it is
enough to say that we might
conclude the whole thing very
soon, sooner than you think."
Sheikh said lie believed
Pearl was still alive, adding,
"there are so many things 1
cannot talk about."
Although Sheikh gave no de
tails of any progress, other
sources close to the investigation
said Karachi police have arrest
ed three men — identified only
as Suleiman, Fawad and
Adeel — believed to have sent
two e-mails that included pic
tures of Pearl.
Those e-mails, sent last week,
are believed to be the only gen
uine communications from the
kidnappers. The sources spoke
on condition of anonymity.
Pearl, the Journal's South
Asian bureau chief, had been
seeking an interview with a Mus

lim cleric, Sheik Mubarak Ali
Shah Gilani. Gilani has been ar
rested but claims no knowledge
of the kidnapping.
Although investigators have
not ruled out criminal gangs,
their suspicion has focused on
the Islamic extremist Harkat ul-
Mujahedeen or Movement of
Holy War, and Jaish-e-Mo
hammed, or Army of Muham
mad. Both have been declared
terrorist organizations by the
United States and banned by the
Pakistani government.
One of the key suspects is a
Harkat ul-Mujahedeen mem
ber known as Arif. Police have
identified him as Mohammed
Hashim Qadeer. He is be
lieved to have been one of
Pearl's contacts.
In an open letter late Mon
day, the Journal's managing ed
itor, Paul Steiger, urged Pearl's
captors to make contact. Steiger
said direct communication
would help end the "great deal
of confusion" caused by hoax e
mails from people who claimed
to be holding Pearl.
Steiger's letter was addressed
to the National Movement for
the Restoration of Pakistani Sov
ereignty, a previously unknown
group that claimed in a Jan. 27
e-mail to be holding Pearl.
The e-mail included pho
tographs of Pearl — one with a
gun to his head — and demands
that Washington return Pak
istani prisoners held at the U.S.
naval base in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, for trial in Pakistan. The
Bush administration has ruled
out any negotiations.
Police say they are closing in
on the kidnappers of the Wall
Street Journal reporter.
