# Doctors discover new gene technique

### MARK BOWERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although cardiovascular dis
ease is the most common cause of
death in Europe and North Amer
ica, discoveries about the genetic
and molecular interactions that
cause it have not been made until
recently. Understanding the ge
netic processes of the disease has
been a lifelong pursuit for Dr.
Thomas Quertermous, director of
the Division of Cardiovascular
Medicine Research at Stanford
Medical School, and director of the
Donald W. Reynolds Cardiovascu
lar Clinical Research Center.
"1 became disenchanted with
the fact that many of the risk fac
tors associated with heart disease
were known, but no massive
strides had been made in under
standing the biology of the vessel
wall," Quertermous said.
"We know that those with high

cholesterol get heart disease, but
one person may get it at age 8,
whereas another person gets it at
48. The reason is that there are
many genes involved in the disease
process in the vessel wall."
Quertermous' lab is trying to
track down all the genes involved
in vascular disease. By studying
them in concert, they hope to find
which are involved in causing the
disease, and ultimately use them
for developing an effective treat
ment for it.
Microarrays, commonly known
as gene chips, were recently dis
covered at Stanford. Each array
consists of thousands of small DNA
strands arranged in a given se
quence. Knowledge of this se
quence allows biologists to analyze
thousands of genes at once.
"The key component to coming
up with the genes and putting
them in the appropriate time
course is the microarray," Ouert

ermous said.
"Microarray techniques are the
best available way to sort and make
sense of the enormous amount of
information, which lias been made
available as a result of the massive
efforts of the genome projects,"
said Dr. Roger Wagner, a cardiol
ogy fellow in Quertermous' lab.
"Knowing the sequence of a
genome has been likened to hav
ing a parts list for an organism, be
it yeast, worm or man. The chal
lenge facing us now is to figure out
how those parts fit together to
make these incredibly complex
machines, and how broken or de
fective parts might contribute to
breakdowns like developmental
defects, cancer or even heart dis
ease," Wagner said.
Some scientists claim that analyz
ing microarrays complicates re
search, since so much information is
involved. Quertermous said that re
sults are not necessarily immediate.

"With microarrays, the devil is
always in the details," he said. "You
must keep good statistics, commit
to doing many experiments and
commit a lot of time to making the
array. Hut it is a wonderful tool."
Quertermous' study involves
finding which genes are present
in the removed heart tissue of
transplant patients, and conduct
ing experiments to find which
genes contribute to causing vascu
lar disease. For him, applying this
work to helping patients c linical
ly is important.
"One of the main reasons I
came to Stanford was the strong
collaboration that exists with in
dustry," Quertermous said. "We
all want to see our basic work trans
lated into human therapeutics,
which is something industry does
well, and we do poorly. The best
way to achieve this is to line up the
priorities of the research with the
priorities of the company."
