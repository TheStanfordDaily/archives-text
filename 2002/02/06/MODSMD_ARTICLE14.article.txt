# Congress subpoenas Enron chief Ken Lay
## 
### 
WASH INGTON (AP) — The
Senate Commerce Committee
voted unanimously yesterday to
subpoena Kenneth Lay, the for
mer Enron chairman who refused
to appear voluntarily to answer
questions about the collapse of the
energy trading company.
"We have no choice," said Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.I).
Officials said the subpoena
would command Lay to appear
Feb. 12 — but there was little ex
pectation that he would provide
answers to the questions lawmak
ers seemed eager to ask.
Lay also was ordered to appear
before a House panel investigating
Enron on Feb. 14.
"I'll bet you a dollar to a
doughnut that he doesn't testify
and invokes his right under the
Fifth Amendment," said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La. The amend
ment guarantees protection

against self-incrimination.
Kelly Kimberly, a spokeswoman
for Lay, said the subpoena had
been expected and "we anticipate
that they will be in touch with Mr.
Lay's attorney to work out the de
tails." She said Lay's attorney also is
working with the House subcom
mittee seeking Lay's testimony.
Millions of investors lost
money — and thousands of cur
rent and former Enron employees
lost the great bulk of their retire
ment savings when the company
collapsed. An internal investiga
tion blamed senior management
for failing to provide proper over
sight into a complex web of part
nerships that helped the company
hide debt and report unrealistic
profit figures.
Fhe taint has spread beyond
the Houston-based company, and
the head of the accounting firm
Arthur Andersen appeared at a

separate congressional hearing to
defend its work with Enron.
"I did not do the audit of the com
pany,'' Joseph Berardino, the An
dersen chief, said at one point. "In
formation was withheld from us."
He said Enron did not provide
critical information about one of the
partnership's arrangements with
Barclays Bank of Britain. He said
that if the auditors had been given
that information in 1997, Andersen
would have objected to Enron's ac
counting for the partnership.
Later, he said, "At the end of
the day we do not cause compa
nies to fail."
His testimony drew scorn from
lawmakers in both parties. "You
have squandered the integrity of
your company," said Rep. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y.
The vote in the Senate commit
tee came little more than 24 hours
after Lay was to have appeared.

1 le canceled his testimony on short
notice after his lawyer said the pro
ceedings had taken on a prosecu
torial tone.
Some senators expressed skep
ticism of claims by Lay that he did
not know details about the finan
cial dealings that an internal
Enron investigation called "a sys
tematic and pervasive" attempt by
senior managers to "misrepresent
the company's financial condition"
by hiding millions of dollars in
debt and losses.
While the committee vote was
unanimous, there was some par
tisan sparring about an allega
tion from Sen. Ernest Hollings,
IKS.C., the chairman, that the
Bush administration and Enron
had participated in a "cash and
carry" relationship.
Lay resigned Monday from
Enron's board after relinquishing
his position as Enron chairman.
