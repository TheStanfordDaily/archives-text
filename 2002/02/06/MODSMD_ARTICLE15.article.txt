## The
						Stanford Daily Tuition hike promotes socioeconomic diversity 
### 
Published Since 1891

The University's announcement today
that it plans to increase undergraduate
tuition, nx)m and board by 4.9 percent
for the upcoming school year is not like
ly to elicit a lot of applause from the student Ixxly.
llie hike will bring total costs to a whopping
$35,883, keeping Stanford among the world's
most pricey institutions of higher education.
At first glance, the numbers seem outra
geous. Could it really cost over $ 1,000 a week to
educate a Stanford student?
In a word, yes. In fact, University officials es
timate that students who pay full tuition are cov
ering only al)out 60 percent of the real cost of
their Stanford education. The other 40 percent
is subsidized by the University's endowment.
When costs rise — as they do every year, mostly
due to inflation — the price of tuition rises with
it, keeping that ratio stable.
While nationwide inflation projections for
2002 hover around 2 percent, the consumer

price index in the Bay Area jumped by over 5
percent last year, a fact that helps to explain why
Stanford has been raising its tuition more than
elite colleges in other parts of the country.
Yet the most compelling reason the Board of
Trustees has offered for its annual tuition hike
pertains not to the value of the dollar, but to the
University's need-blind admissions policy.
Simply put, higher tuition places a greater
share of the burden on those who can afford it.
The University will still meet the full demon
strated need of students on financial aid, so the
tuition increase should not affect them. It is the
students whose families who can theoretically
afford the cost of sending them to Stanford who
will pay an extra $ 1,287 next year.
While those who do not receive financial aid
may groan at the sight of quarterly bills nearing
$ 12,000, most of them will not be prevented from
attending Stanford as a result. In contrast, if Stan
ford abandoned its policy of admitting students

without regard to their ability to pay, a substantial
population of worthy students from less-affluent
backgrounds would have to be turned away.
Stanford is one of the tew private institutions
in the country that maintains this need-blind ad
missions policy. That's because it is an extreme
ly expensive practice. But its ultimate aim justi
fies its high cost — it serves to promote socioe
conomic diversity.
In economic terms, next year's rate in
crease represents a form of price discrimina
tion, a generally desirable measure that tends
to enhance economic efficiency. In human
terms, it represents a commitment to give stu
dents from low-income families an equal op
portunity to attend one of the nation's pre
mier colleges.
Aside from the obvious drain on the pockets
of relatively wealthy parents, the one serious
drawback to the increase is that it may drive
middle-class families that don't quite qualify for

aid — or qualify for limited aid — to seek a less
expensive school. For these families, spiraling
costs mean exorbitant loans and, to some ex
tent, a lower quality of life.
Last year, the University took an important
step to address this problem by instituting a
loan cap to aid middle-income families. Yet
more remains to be done to soften the blow of
the yearly tuition hikes to their pocketbooks.
Furthermore, the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions must continue to take positive ac
tion to encourage prospective students from
low-income families to take advantage of its
generous financial-aid packages and actually
attend Stanford.
If the University continues its efforts in these
two areas, the entire student body will benefit
from the results and students who are tempted
to protest the annual tuition increases will have
only to look at the corresponding rise in diversi
ty to see its positive effects.
