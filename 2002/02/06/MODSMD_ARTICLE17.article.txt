Super Bowl commercial calls war on
drugs into question
Anyone who watched the Super Bowl
last Sunday was likely moved by a new
anti-drug advertising campaign offered
by the U.S. Office of National Drug Con
trol Policy.
The campaign intends to link the pur
chase of illegal drugs in the U.S. with the
financing of terrorist activities at home
and abroad.
The message, conveyed by grainy pic
tures of ski masks, AK-47s and explosives,
is that buying illegal drugs on the black
market is akin to writing a check to foreign
terrorists. TheONDCP justifies this claim
on its Web Site by stating that over half of
the international terrorist organizations
recognized by the Suite Department are
involved in drug trafficking.
They even report President George
W. Bush as saying, "When you quit
using drugs, you join the fight against
terror in America."
While I personally believe that the deter
rent effect of this advertising campaign will
be minimal (just as the threat of incarcera
tion and scientific evidence against drug
abuse has had little effect), I do think the
ONDCP has inadvertently shined a light on
a powerful argument for drug legalization.
If drugs were legalized, I doubt terror
ist organizations could compete economi
cally with the production, advertising and
distribution machines of current vice pro
ducers (take Philip Morris as an example),

and would likely be forced to raise rev
enues through other means.
I low many terrorist organizations do
you know that finance themselves on sell
ing potato chips and root beer?
Keeping drugs illegal allows organiza
tions willing to take the risk of drug traf
ficking to gain monopoly power in the pro
duction of a good and earn huge profits. A
recent survey by the Economist magazine
reported the per kilogram price of opium
at $90 from an Afghani farmer, with a re
tail price on U.S. streets of $290,000.
Given that it is unlikely Americans will
stop using illegal drugs in the future, the
ONDCP and American citizens should
consider the financing of terrorist activi
ties as yet another huge cost resulting
from our war on drugs, and ultimately
look beyond our failing strategy of deter
rence at all costs.
