# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Sixth Man needs liquid courage to sober opponents 
### ROBBIE PFEIFER GUEST COLUMNIST 
It's time the Sixth Man Club starts
taking some responsibility for last Sat
urday's loss to Arizona. We could have
helped end the Arizona run or helped
our team regain momentum.
But, as usual, the Stanford fans failed
at the time they were most needed. Un
official home-court-advantage rankings
place us anywhere between a lackluster
sixth and ninth in the conference.
Contrary to popular belief, the prob
lem is not the general shortage of origi
nal chants, clever signs or basic basket
ball knowledge. Our fan base simply

fails to exercise iis collective will for the
benefit of the home team.
A blind faith and irrational confi
dence in our team would transfer to the
players, making them believe they can
beat anyone. Look at Oregon. Just as in
football, they have the best home court
in the conference. 1 have some friends
there, and believe me, they aren't
clever, but they are irrational.
Their record: Home: 8-0, Away: 3-4,
Neutral: 4-1.
1 realize that the Stanford psyche is a
fragile thing for players and fans. We
think that we are too rational, realistic
and intellectual to have the "fanaticism"
of a Morehead State or a BYU fan.

We, on the other hand, did have peo
ple doing homework in the stands be
fore the Arizona game.
Even when we are at our loudest, I
can still sense a subtle diffidence that
grows every time the other team makes
a run. Instead of giving our team confi
dence, we give them self-doubt. When
we were No. 1 this was not much of a
problem, but with a young team, the
consequences can be disastrous.
I hink about how good we looked in
the first half on Saturday and contrast
this to the timid, confused play of the
last 10 minutes. No one looked com
fortable even handling the ball, much
less shooting, and we did nothing to

help them.
But do not despair my friends, God
has given us rationalists an out, a way to
find the spirited zeal of the Inquisition,
the inspired faith of the converted. No,
not Jesus, but alcohol.
It works for other schools, and it will
work for us. It will silence that subversive
voice lurking in the back of our minds
and give us the power to cheer like frost
bitten, bottle-throwing Browns' fans. Our
chants will seem more original, the signs
more clever and basketball knowledge
will be immaterial amidst the stream of
vulgar obscenities thrown toward the op
posing team.
They expect a bunch of nerds. Why

would rival players care what Stanford
students have to say? Most of them
spent high school making fun of the
kids in the AP classes because they were
going to a "decent" school despite their
academic deficiencies.
A group of rowdy drunks, however,
will confuse them more than anything
else possibly could. So do your part, fin
ish that problem set on Thursday after
noon and grab a 40 while you're stand
ing in line.

Thursday evening you can find Robbie, a
sophomore majoring in economics and phi
losophy, reminding Oregon's Luke Ridnour
that "hippies suck."
