But for many Stanford students, syn

SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
Saturday: Stanford at the Arizona In
vitational, all day, Tuscon, AZ

Some have never seen it. Some have
only seen the spoof on Saturday Night
Live, while others think of Esther Williams
and water ballet.
Synchro is a tough sport. It requires the
strength of a weight lifter, the flexibility of
a gymnast, the endurance of a distance
runner and intense concentration.
Synchronized swimmers use their
arms, legs and core strength to perform
movements in the water that seem to op
pose the laws of physics, while holding
their breath for lengths of time that would
turn most people blue.
And they still manage to smile.
There are two parts in a synchro com
petition: elements and routines. Judges
score each on a scale from one to ten. The
elements score is strictly technical, and
routines receive a technical and artistic
score, similar to figure skating.
"Elements test our individual abili
ty to perform a specific skill," said ju
nior Blaire Fraser. "They are not my
favorite part of competition, but they
are really important."

During elements, each swimmer per
forms the exact same set of skills for the
judges. Each swimmer must perform six
elements. Ihe scores for each swimmer
are totaled and averaged for each team,
and the team with the highest average
wins elements.
One of the elements is the Split Rocket
Closing 360. To perform this skill, the
swimmer first swims 25 yards under
water, then without coming up for air, she
shoots both legs out of the water, throws
them into a split, closes them and spins as
she descends.
The routine portion of competition
consists of solo, duet, trio and team.
Each routine lasts two to four minutes,
depending on the type of routine. The
solo is the shortest; the team is the longest.
The routines are choreographed to music
that is played above and under water.
The team routine is considered the
backbone of synchro. Most teams, Stan
ford included, swim with eight members.
It is the most exciting event to watch.
There is never a dull moment when eight
athletes swim at once.
A greater range of skills and "tricks"
are performed during team in compari
son to the other routines. Three swim
mers can lift another swimmer so she ap
pears to walk on water or fly, while the
other four swimmers might perform an
other lift or skill. The Stanford team rou
tine has five lifts.
For most of the rout ine, all eight swim
mers move in unison, but sets of two or
four might also move together
to create a different effect. Ca
dence actions are also occasion
ally performed.
Patterns such as lines, circles
and diamonds are created as the

swimmers change their position
ing in relation to each other.
These changes occur as the swim
mers perform strokes or are up
side clown, moving their legs in
the air.
During the routine, the swim
mers never touch the bottom or
rest. There is no floating. The
routine is non-stop, intense ac
tion, much of it without oxygen.

The Stanford team routine has
been well received by the judges,
winning again at the Michigan In
vitational last weekend, scoring
several nines.
"It is really exciting to receive
such high scores from the
judges," said freshman Sheila
Sadovnik. "We spend most of
practice perfecting team, and it's
paying off."
