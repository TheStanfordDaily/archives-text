triple jump.
Stanford's top throwers, ju
niors Nick Welihozky and Omer

shot put (52-04.00).
Next on the Cardinal's agen
da is this weekend's Armory
Collegiate Invitational, held in
New York City's Armory Track
& Field Center.
The nation's top track and field
programs are competing in New
York in what meet promoters are
billing as "the nation's premier col
legiate invitational of the season."
2001 NCAA indoor men's
champions LSU, along with the
outdoor champions Tennessee
will give the Cardinal men its
st iff est test of the season so far,
and the competition will be no
less intense on the women's side.
This meet will see the return of
some of the Cardinal's distance
runners, most of whom did not

compete at the Mountain West-
Pac-10 meet.
Junior Lauren Fleshman, the
women's 5,000-meter champion in
last year's outdoor championships,
dominated the 3,000-meters at the
Terrier (Classic two weeks ago and is
slated as one of the top runners to
watch at Armory.
Some of the younger distance
runners, however, will be in Ore
gon for the Junior National Cross
Country Championships, a meet
limited to athletes 19 years of age
and younger.
A team of six men and
women will represent the USA
in the World Junior Cross
Country Championships.
Freshmen Seton McAndrews,
Neil Davis, Sara Bei and sopho
more Katherine Hoffman will
compete for these spots.
Also absent from the Armory
Invitational will be 5,000-meter
runners seeking NCAA qualifying
times in that event, as there will be
no 5 kilometer race at Armory.
Sophomores lan Dobson and
Chris Emme, junior Louis Lu
chini and senior James Nielsen
will likely travel to a different,
as yet unspecified meet.
Distance runners, sprinters,
throwers and jumpers alike are
using each indoor meet as an op
portunity to gain an NCAA berth.
The number of opportuni
ties to secure a spot in the
NCAA Indoor Championships
is dwindling, and this week
end's meet will see the nation's
top athletes vying for qualify
ing marks.
