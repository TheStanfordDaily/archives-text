Forget the Super Bowl. This week
end, Stanford women's gymnastics was
jumping, dancing and performing its
way to back-to-back victories.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
Sunday: No. 7 Stanford vs. No. 11
UCLA, 2:00 p.m., Los Angeles

On Friday night, the Cardinal upset
No. 9 Arizona and then turned around
on Sunday to trounce the University of
Denver. After this intense weekend, the
Cardinal (4-1,4-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
moved up in the rankings to No. 7.
First up for Stanford was Arizona (6-2,
1-1 Pac-10). With a score of 197.250-
195.175, a blowout of sorts in the gym
nastics world, it would seem that the
meet was no sweat for the Cardinal.
However, the Wildcats put up a tough
fight and even posted season-high scores
in vault and bars.
But the Cardinal was at the top of its
game, scoring season-best team totals in
every event. Beating Arizona in all but
one event, Stanford stole the show with
energy and poise.
On the beam, Stanford received the
second-highest beam score in school his
tory with a 49.400. The Cardinal scored
a 49.175 on vault, a 49.425 on bars and a
49.250 on floor.
On the individual side, sophomore
Caroline Fluhrer earned a team-high
39.025 in the all-around to take second.
On bars, senior Becky Meldrum
grabbed first with a 9.925. Sophomore
Lise Leveillie took first on the beam with
a 9.950 and then went on to score a 9.900
on floor.

The second team to fall — figura
tively and literally — at the hands of
Stanford was the accident-prone Pio
neers (2-2). Plagued by drops, hard
landings and near disasters, Denver
didn't stand a chance against the seem
ingly flawless Cardinal.
The Pioneers were in trouble from the
start as junior Michelle Kasuga missed on
a release move on the bars, fell and was
unable to finish her routine. Several of
her teammates followed her lead and had
trouble with landings in other events.
The tense air looming over Denver
didn't seem to atfect Stanford. The Car
dinal outscored the Pioneers in three of
the four events.
Each team received a 48.900 on the
vault, while the Cardinal held a season
best 49.550-48.100 edge on the bars, a

49.250-48.550 margin on the beam and
a season-best 49.375-48.950 advantage
on the floor exercise.
Cardinal gymnasts seized individual
first place finishes in all four categories.
Fluhrer placed first on the vault, record
ing a 9.900. Meldrum posted a season
best 9.950 to earn first place on the un
even bars. Leveille captured the top spot
on both the beam and floor exercise with
a 9.925 in each event.
Sophomore Lindsay Wing added to
the team's overall score by earning sec
ond place finishes on the uneven bars
and beam.
" fhe senior leadership was outstand
ing," said head coach Kristen Smyth.
"They provided experience, composure,

balance beam and in the floor exercise with a score of 9.925 on both apparatuses in the
Cardinal's dominant win over Denver on Sunday.
and energy, However, winning
these meets was an incredible
team effort."
Light Cardinal gymnasts post
ed scores of 9.900 or better on the
day spread out over all four events.
"Everyone did an awesome job
this weekend, especially with it
being a back-to-back weekend,"

said Meldrum. "I think one of our
greatest strengths, particularly this
past weekend, is that everyone just
does what they are supposed to do,
no questions asked," she said.
This coming weekend the girls
will again have to be ready lor un
expected changes. This thriller
meet will come in the form of a
conference showdown against No.
11 UCLA (5-4, 1-1 Pac-10) on Sun
day at 2:00.
Last year, these teams faced
each other twice. The Bruins de

feated the Cardinal 196.925-
194.675 in the regular season, but
the Cardinal avenged this loss the
second time around with a
197.850-197.800 edge in the Pac
-10 championship.
"The main strength in our team
is that we really have fun togeth
er," said senior Katy Herbert. "It's
great to see everyone get so excited
when a teammate does well. I can't
wait to take on UCLA — they're
probably getting a little worried
about us right now."
