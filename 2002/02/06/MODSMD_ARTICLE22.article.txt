The Stanford men's squash
team continues to hold steady at
No. 20 in the National Intercol
legiate Squash Racquets Associa
tion rankings with just two weeks
to go until the NISRA national
team championships.

CLUB SPORTS ROUNDUP

The No. 20 ranking is the high
est ever for the four-year old Stan
ford club and is the highest rank
ing ever for any West Coast team.
Stanford is the top-ranked
club team in the country, and
with the exception of California,
all of Stanford's competition this
year has been against East Coast
varsity programs.
The Cardinal squad went 3-2
last month during a three-day
trip to Yale from Jan. 18-20, pick
ing up wins against No. 27

Rochester, No. 29 Ford ham and
No. 32 St. Lawrence. The trip
to Yale followed soon after the
Bulldogs came out to Stanford
on Jan. 10, marking the first
time an East Coast squad had
ever visited the Farm.
Stanford is looking ahead to
(he NISRA team championships,
which will be hosted by Harvard
Feb. 22-24. The Cardinal will be
battling for the Division 111 cham
pionship in the tournament,
which is divided up into five divi
sions based on the teams' rank
ings during the season with eight
teams placed in each division.
Last year, Stanford claimed the
Division IV title to claim its high
est ever final ranking at No. 25.
MEN'S RUGBY
The Stanford men's rugby
team kicked off its league schedule
in grand style on Saturday, flat
tening an overmatched San Jose
State team 81-0 at Malonev Field.

The Cardinal squad execut
ed extremely well against the
larger, but less-skilled Spar
tans, to improve to 2-3 on its
2002 schedule. The team
looked much improved from
its disappointing 41-0 loss at
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo on
Jan. 29.
The Stanford squad will look
to build off Saturday's win as it
continues league play this week -
end in the Northern California
Rugby Football Unions' men's
collegiate second division. The
Cardinal will host Santa Rosa Ju
nior College at 1 p.m. on Satur
day before heading out to Stock
ton to take on the University of
the Pacific on Sunday.
WOMEN'S RUGBY
