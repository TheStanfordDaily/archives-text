# U.S. budget holds student aid steady
## Bush proposes cutting one federal aid program 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Monday, President
George W. Bush proposed a
federal budget that totaled
nearly $2.13 trillion for the
2003 fiscal year. While he pro
posed increasing funding to
the National Institutes of
Health by 15.7 percent and to
the National Science Founda
tion by 5 percent, major feder
al student-aid programs will
see no such raise. Bush also
plans on eliminating a federal
program that is based on states
matching need-based financial
aid, dollar for dollar.
There was no request placed
fora hike in funding student
aid programs â€” including Col
lege Work-Study, Perkins
Loans and Supplemental Edu
cational Opportunity Grants.
Two other educational is
sues considered by Bush in

Grant and the Leveraging Ed
ucational Assistance Partner

ships program.
Bush's proposal keeps the
maximum Pell Grant amount
at $4,000, the same as it was for
the 2002 fiscal year.
The Leveraging Education
al Assistance Partnerships pro
gram is a plan designed to en
courage states to expand their
own need-based grant pro
grams by requiring them to
match federal funding dollar
for dollar. If the appropriation
made to LEAP by the federal
government exceeds $30 mil
lion, the state must match each
dollar with two of its own. In
stead, Bush wants to eliminate
the program.
"It's really disappointing to
cut a program like LEAP," said
Corye Barbour, legislative di
rector for the United States
Student Association, a lobbying
group for students. "[The gov
ernment's] rationale for cut
ting LEAP is that '[it] has ac

encourage states to create
these programs.' 1 heartily dis
agree with that statement."
