# U.S. budget holds student aid steady
## Bush proposes cutting one federal aid program 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Monday, President
George W. Bush proposed a
federal budget that totaled
nearly $2.13 trillion for the
2003 fiscal year. While he pro
posed increasing funding to
the National Institutes of
Health by 15.7 percent and to
the National Science Founda
tion by 5 percent, major feder
al student-aid programs will
see no such raise. Bush also
plans on eliminating a federal
program that is based on states
matching need-based financial
aid, dollar for dollar.
There was no request placed
fora hike in funding student
aid programs — including Col
lege Work-Study, Perkins
Loans and Supplemental Edu
cational Opportunity Grants.
Two other educational is
sues considered by Bush in
clude the maximum Pell
Grant and the Leveraging Ed
ucational Assistance Partner

ships program.
Bush's proposal keeps the
maximum Pell Grant amount
at $4,000, the same as it was for
the 2002 fiscal year.
The Leveraging Education
al Assistance Partnerships pro
gram is a plan designed to en
courage states to expand their
own need-based grant pro
grams by requiring them to
match federal funding dollar
for dollar. If the appropriation
made to LEAP by the federal
government exceeds $30 mil
lion, the state must match each
dollar with two of its own. In
stead, Bush wants to eliminate
the program.
"It's really disappointing to
cut a program like LEAP," said
Corye Barbour, legislative di
rector for the United States
Student Association, a lobbying
group for students. "[The gov
ernment's] rationale for cut
ting LEAP is that '[it] has ac
complished | its] objective to
encourage states to create
these programs.' 1 heartily dis
agree with that statement."
On Monday, according to
the Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation, the Bush administra
tion also announced a list of
1,626 projects already included
in the last fiscal year's appropri
ations bill that financed the De
partments of Education, I lealth
and Human Services and
Labor.
Bush has asked Congress to
cut off funds for most of the pro
jects, many of which benefited
colleges. His rationale was the
$1.3 billion setback in the Pell
Grant program's budget this
year. That shortfall was due to an
unexpected rise in student need
for the grants the previous year.
To help prevent another un
derallocation of resources, Bush
has proposed to allow the secre

tary of education to have the au
thority to set the maximum Pell
Grant level, a switch from the
previous authority, which was
held by Congress.
William 1). Hansen, the
deputy secretary of education,
backed Bush's student-aid plan
proposal at a news conference on
Monday. I le brought up the fact
that over the last five years the
spending on Pell Grants has
more than doubled.
He also noted that the maxi
mum award has increased $700
in the last two years.
"We have more money than
ever going to higher education to
make education more afford
able," he said.
Barbour disagrees.
"[Federal funding is] so far
behind the cost of education,"
she said. "[The Pell Grant] is the

cornerstone of federal financial
aid, but students still have
unmet needs. That means
they're piecing together extra
jobs that they shouldn't have to
do. By working more than one
job, they may be compromising
their success in college."
According to Barbour, high
achieving, low-income students
attend college at lower rates than
high-income students with poor
grade-point averages and low
standardized test scores.
"The population of people
going to college [is] increasingly
of lower income, of color and of
returning students," Barbour
said. "What that means is that
these students are going to need
more assistance. We are starting
to see results, and that is going to
cost money. We are going to
need to prepare for that."

According to Barbour, high
achieving, low-income students
attend college at lower rates than
high-income students with poor
grade-point averages and low
standardized test scores.
"The population of people
going to college [is] increasingly
of lower income, of color and of
returning students," Barbour
said. "What that means is that
these students are going to need
more assistance. We are starting
to see results, and that is going to
cost money. We are going to
need to prepare for that."
