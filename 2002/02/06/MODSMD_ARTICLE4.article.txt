# Board hikes tuition 4.9 percent
## Trustees claim increase helps commitment to need-blind admission 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Board of Trustees gathered yesterday
to discuss several issues a'nd approved a 4.9
percent increase in the rates for undergradu

ate tuition, room and board for the 2002-2003
school year.
This marks the fifth consecutive year that the
Board has raised tuition. According to the
Trustees, the hike reflects Stanford's commit
ment to admitting students regardless of their
ability to pay.
"The costs of providing an education at
Stanford continue to rise, especially given the
enormous commitment we have given to finan
cial aid and need-blind admission," said Isaac
Stein, chairman of the Board. "There's an in

herent challenge ever) year... the average
cost of education is substantially higher than tu
ition charges."
Next year, the undergraduate tuition rate
will increase by $ 1,287, the standard room rate
by $273 and the basic board rate by $103,
bringing total tuition up to $35,883.
Senior Jessica Swafford expressed her dis
may over the tuition hike.
"I'm glad I'm getting out now before they
raise tuition any higher," Swafford said.
"Maybe if they lowered tuition, fewer students
would be on financial aid. Throughout my en
tire Stanford career, tuition has been rising, but
I have not seen any huge changes that justify
the expense."
Sophomore Matthew Twomey echoed
these sentiments.
"Unless I see a visible change so I know
where this money is going, I don't see why tu
ition should keep increasing," Twomey said. "If
it's going to buy another palm tree, then it
doesn't make sense."
Tuition covers only about 60 percent of the
actual costs that Stanford incurs to educate an
undergraduate student.
With the ongoing economic recession, the
Trustees expressed concerned about the finan
cial burden on students and families. They ex
amined the data from a series of surveys for
Stanford parents that assessed the parents' per
ceptions of the Stanford experience.
"[The purpose of the survey was] to make
sure there [was] no deterioration or substantial
negative change in their opinions," Stein said.
"In (act, there has been a slight increase in sat
isfaction over the years."

than its peer institutions, "which
means we cannot rely on our en
dowment income to cover all of the
costs [of financial aid]," Stein said.
Last year, the University low
ered the amount that students are

expected to contribute to their ed
ucational costs through loans and
part-time work to $5,250. They
also reduced the expected parental
contribution for middle-income
families by capping the value of
home equity considered in calcu
lating the financial aid package.
"It is something that has really
been valuable for us in competing
with other schools," said Cynthia

Hartley, director of financial aid
planning and policy analysis.
Tuition for all graduate pro
grams was increased by 5 percent,
except the Graduate School of
Business, which raised tuition by
7.4 percent to $33,000 per year.
Other topics the Trustees dis
cussed included the annual student
/ faculty / trustee dinners, which
were held last night. This year, the

dinners were held at faculty homes
instead of in dormitories. Stein said
that that the change in atmosphere
had a positive impact on the tone
and focus of the dinners.
Trustees also indicated that the
Think Again Tour, designed to
bring the undergraduate experi
ence to alumni and parents at
twelve separate gatherings around
the country, has been successful.
