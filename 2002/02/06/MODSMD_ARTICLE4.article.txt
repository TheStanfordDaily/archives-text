# Board hikes tuition 4.9 percent
## Trustees claim increase helps commitment to need-blind admission 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Board of Trustees gathered yesterday
to discuss several issues a'nd approved a 4.9
percent increase in the rates for undergradu

ate tuition, room and board for the 2002-2003
school year.
This marks the fifth consecutive year that the
Board has raised tuition. According to the
Trustees, the hike reflects Stanford's commit
ment to admitting students regardless of their
ability to pay.
"The costs of providing an education at
Stanford continue to rise, especially given the
enormous commitment we have given to finan
cial aid and need-blind admission," said Isaac
Stein, chairman of the Board. "There's an in

herent challenge ever) year... the average
cost of education is substantially higher than tu
ition charges."
Next year, the undergraduate tuition rate
will increase by $ 1,287, the standard room rate
by $273 and the basic board rate by $103,
bringing total tuition up to $35,883.
Senior Jessica Swafford expressed her dis
may over the tuition hike.
"I'm glad I'm getting out now before they
raise tuition any higher," Swafford said.
"Maybe if they lowered tuition, fewer students
would be on financial aid. Throughout my en
tire Stanford career, tuition has been rising, but
I have not seen any huge changes that justify
the expense."
Sophomore Matthew Twomey echoed
these sentiments.
"Unless I see a visible change so I know
where this money is going, I don't see why tu
ition should keep increasing," Twomey said. "If
it's going to buy another palm tree, then it
doesn't make sense."
Tuition covers only about 60 percent of the
actual costs that Stanford incurs to educate an
undergraduate student.
With the ongoing economic recession, the
Trustees expressed concerned about the finan
cial burden on students and families. They ex
amined the data from a series of surveys for
Stanford parents that assessed the parents' per
ceptions of the Stanford experience.
"[The purpose of the survey was] to make
sure there [was] no deterioration or substantial
negative change in their opinions," Stein said.
"In (act, there has been a slight increase in sat
isfaction over the years."
