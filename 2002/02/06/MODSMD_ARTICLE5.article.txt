# Alum Kataoka establishes art scholarship
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Drue Kataoka, a 23-year-old
artist and Stanford alumna
from the class of 2000 '.»as col
laborated with The Menlo Park
Rotary Club to sponsor an an
nual art scholarship for high
school students.
Kataoka will sell prints of her
work to fund the scholarship in
her name. Although the details
have yet to be worked out, the
club hopes to award one schol
arship annually to a college
bound high school student who
is serious about pursuing a ca
reer in art.
Kataoka, who specializes in
an ancient form of Japanese
monochrome ink painting
called "sumi-e," intends to raise
money for the scholarship
through the sale of her work,

beginning with prints of her re
cent painting "Highway Hop
scotch." Since Dec. 19, sales for
the limited edition of 500
prints have reached $31,500,
which is more than 60 percent
of the scholarship's annual goal
of $50,000.
"The Menlo Park Rotary has
a long history of investing in
young people and their
dreams," Kataoka said. She
won the club's Scholarship
Award for Music in 1995, and a
Rotary Foundation Honor
Scholarship the following year.
"Menlo Park Rotary invested in
me, and now they are allowing
me to invest in my dream of
promoting the arts for genera
tions to come," she said.
Kataoka noted that while
there are many scholarships for

talented athletes, there is a lack
of similar opportunities for
young artists.
"I really want to influence young
people into pursuing a career in the
arts," she said. "1 do think that the
arts are undercapitalized."
According to Kataoka, the three
primary sponsors of the scholar
ship are donor Helen Bing, Palo
Alto's University Art Center and
Redwood City's Pacific Printing &
Publications, Inc.
All the proceeds from the sales
of "Highway Hopscotch" go to the
scholarship. The only money that

Kataoka receives is from the pro
ject's original commission.
David Blackwood, a member of
the Highway Hopscotch Commit
tee and past president of the
Menlo Park Rotary Club, said that
the Drue Kataoka Scholarship is
unique to the club.
"This is the first experience I've
had where someone offered to
give back to Rotary," he said, "ft
really touched our hearts. How
many 23-year-olds would raise
$30,000 of what could potentially
be their own income for interna
tional service?"
"Highway Hopscotch" shows a
girl playing hopscotch across a
globe. Kataoka said that the work
contains a duality stemming from
the fact that she started the paint

ing before Sept. 11 but finished it
after the terrorist attacks.
" Fhe girl shows innocence, re
silience, determination and re
solve simultaneously," she said.
"The numbers in the hopscotch
square add to 10 — the last day of
our innocence."
Kataoka has spoken at many
schools to encourage interest in
the arts. As evidence of her success,
she cited the effort of third graders
at Encinal Elementary School to
raise money to send a copy of
"Highway Hopscotch" to the chil
dren of Afghanistan.
Kataoka, who graduated with a
bachelor's in art history, has pro
duced paintings that are showcased
in several campus locations. These
include "Gallery of Champions" at

theTaube Family Tennis Stadium,
"The Unfinished Dream" at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Pro
ject Center and"I Ring for Peace"
at the base of Hoover Tower.
Copies of all her paintings are
archived in Stanford's Department
of Special Collections.
Speaking at a Stanford assem
bly on Jan. 17, Kataoka argued
that art can play a far more crucial
and positive role than most peo
ple acknowledge.
"For me, art is a powerful
weapon in our national arsenal,
but sadly it remains unused and
abused," she said. "Conquering
our fears with art helps the healing
process for our children as we re
build our commitment to our na
tion's cultural values."

"The Menlo Park Rotary has
a long history of investing in

won the club's Scholarship
Award for Music in 1995, and a
Rotary Foundation Honor

Drue Kataoka, class of 2000, has established a scholarship for high-school students
interested in pursuing artistic studies. She graduated with a degree in art history.
talented athletes, there is a lack
of similar opportunities for
young artists.
"I really want to influence young
people into pursuing a career in the
arts," she said. "1 do think that the
arts are undercapitalized."
According to Kataoka, the three
primary sponsors of the scholar
ship are donor Helen Bing, Palo
Alto's University Art Center and
Redwood City's Pacific Printing &
Publications, Inc.
All the proceeds from the sales
of "Highway Hopscotch" go to the
scholarship. The only money that

Kataoka receives is from the pro
ject's original commission.
David Blackwood, a member of
the Highway Hopscotch Commit
tee and past president of the
Menlo Park Rotary Club, said that
the Drue Kataoka Scholarship is
unique to the club.
"This is the first experience I've
had where someone offered to
give back to Rotary," he said, "ft
really touched our hearts. How
many 23-year-olds would raise
$30,000 of what could potentially
be their own income for interna
tional service?"
"Highway Hopscotch" shows a
girl playing hopscotch across a
globe. Kataoka said that the work
contains a duality stemming from
the fact that she started the paint

ing before Sept. 11 but finished it
after the terrorist attacks.
" Fhe girl shows innocence, re
silience, determination and re
solve simultaneously," she said.
"The numbers in the hopscotch
square add to 10 — the last day of
our innocence."
Kataoka has spoken at many
schools to encourage interest in
the arts. As evidence of her success,
she cited the effort of third graders
at Encinal Elementary School to
raise money to send a copy of
"Highway Hopscotch" to the chil
dren of Afghanistan.
Kataoka, who graduated with a
bachelor's in art history, has pro
duced paintings that are showcased
in several campus locations. These
include "Gallery of Champions" at

theTaube Family Tennis Stadium,
"The Unfinished Dream" at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Pro
ject Center and"I Ring for Peace"
at the base of Hoover Tower.
Copies of all her paintings are
archived in Stanford's Department
of Special Collections.
Speaking at a Stanford assem
bly on Jan. 17, Kataoka argued
that art can play a far more crucial
and positive role than most peo
ple acknowledge.
"For me, art is a powerful
weapon in our national arsenal,
but sadly it remains unused and
abused," she said. "Conquering
our fears with art helps the healing
process for our children as we re
build our commitment to our na
tion's cultural values."
