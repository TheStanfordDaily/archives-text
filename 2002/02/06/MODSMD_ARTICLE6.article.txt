# Brewer and Cordero sum up year
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Quality of campus life, diversity, social and envi
ronmental responsibility are the stuff Stanford stu-

dent dreams are made of,
ASSU President Matt
Brewer and Vice President
Christine Cordero said in

their State of the Association address yesterday.
Speaking in the second-floor lobby of Tresidder
Memorial Union to a crowd of about thirty ASSU
personnel, administrators and students, Brewer
and Cordero addressed what they called the prima
ry concerns of the student body.
"It was cool," Brewer, a junior, said. "Rarely do
we get the chance to look at the year [as a whole]."
Student life, Brewer said, had been improved by
a number of projects, including expanding the
Thanksgiving Dinner to undergraduates, working
more closely with the Graduate Student Council on
graduate concerns, reviving the Stanford Savers
program and funding over 200 student groups via
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
They said diversity had been fostered by items
such as an idea to introduce a new stall position to
dorms to educate students on cultural issues, work
with student groups wishing to express themselves

after the Sept. 11 tragedy and the revival of a pro
gram to bring diverse guest faculty to the campus.
Finally, Christine Cordero, a senior, called for
greater social responsibility and voice, citing recent
student groups' efforts to remove hospital waste in
cineration from low-income areas and negotiate for
hospital workers' rights.
"We have held big hopes and lofty ambitions for
our one-year term," Brewer said, "many of which
have blossomed into reality."
In a more somber note, the pair chastised the ad
ministration — represented in the audience by sev
eral deans and Vice Provost of Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni — for failing to hear student concerns.
" The erosion of student voice is an issue that
needs to be addressed," Cordero, said.
They also addressed their own failure to bring st n
dent voice into the ASSU. "One of the shortcomings
of the ASSU," Brewer said, "has been its failure to
connect with students." Me cited the common Stan
ford student question, "'What does the ASSU do?'"
Brewer said their job would continue until the
day students could answer the question themselves.
Audience member Sarah Oh said she was the
"perfect candidate" for Brewer and Cordero's
"Joe Random" Stanford student who knew noth-

ing about the ASSU*. Oh only
came to the speech because she
knew Brewer and wanted to
find out a little more about how
the system worked.
However, she admitted that
even after the speech she still
didn't know what the ASSU did.

"I think the ASSU should be
more central to the workings of
the school," Oh, a sophomore,
said. "There's a lot going on,
but the ASSU doesn't have a
central role."
In spite of her skepticism
about the ASSU's ability to con
nect to students, she was im
pressed by Brewer's work. "All I
know is that it's a huge job —
Matt is never in [our dorm] — so
I give them big props for that."
