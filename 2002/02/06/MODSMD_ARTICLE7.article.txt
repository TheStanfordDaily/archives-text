# Kappa Sigma faces alcohol suspension
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A case of fraternity miscon
duct that has been investigated
since last spring quarter finally
came to an end with the Greek
Judicial Board's December deci
sion to place six sanctions on the
Kappa Sigma fraternity. An ad
ditional penalty of alcohol pro
bation was imposed by Dean of
Students Marc Wais.
The sanctions and alcohol
probation came in result of
"conduct issues last spring as
well as fire code violations at [the
fraternity's] Luau party," said
junior Kyle Vataha, Kappa Sig's

president.
According to Associate Dean
of Students Morris Graves, a fire
alarm was activated at the frater
nity after the party was over, at
which point the fire department
discovered several violations.
These infractions included
blocked exits, flammable party
materials and lights covered in
paper and plastic.
These hazards, in addition
to other incidents involving
several members during spring
quarter, prompted the board to
take action.
Because the incidents at
Kappa Sig occurred late last
spring, the judicial board was not
able to hand down a full decision
until last month.
"It has been our practice not to
convene the judicial board during
dead and finals week," Graves said.
"In spite of this, the board decided
to meet and make four-and-a-half
hours of interviews."
Last year's board gathered all of
the information in the case, but
was unable to reach a decision in

time for the end of the school year.
A new board re-examined the case
this year and recommended to
Wais six sanctions against the fra
ternity. These sanctions included
the development of a written lead
ership program.
"There was a concern by the
[board] that in some respects the
leadership of the frat [was] elected
into positions without adequate
training for the positions they
held," Graves said.
In addition to these sanctions,
Wais added the alcohol probation
penalty, perhaps the most severe
sanction for the fraternity.
"At Kappa Sig [sponsored]

functions and events there's an al
cohol probation until the end of
rush this year," said Martin Ruano,
Interfraternity Council president
and resident assistant in the Kappa
Sig house.
Kappa Sig's probation has been
met with mixed reviews from the
student body.
"1 think that Kappa Sig's repu
tation, especially with freshmen, is
suffering because of its probation,"
said one freshman. "Let's face it,
less alcohol means less attention as
far as fi at parties go. Unfortunate
ly, this makes it harder for people
to realize that there are a lot of
good guys there."

Another freshman disagreed,
pointing out that some University
sanctions are necessary to ensure
the safety of party-goers and fra
ternity members.
"It's definitely too bad that
the frat can't have alcoholic par
ties anymore, but I think it sends
a signal that the University will
not tolerate events which are un
safe," the freshman said. "The
sanctions are certainly not exces
sive. f'm sure that the house can
make it until spring without al
coholic parties."
Members of Kappa Sig, while
frustrated to some extent with the
sanctions, seemed to understand

the University's position.
"Last spring we had a couple of
issues that got blown out of pro
portion, and we didn't really han
dle them as well as we should
have," junior Scott Paulson said.
"Obviously 1 disagree with it, but
I'm not really that upset about it.
It conld have been a lot worse."
"We're trying to look for ways to
get parties together without alco
hol," he said.
"As a chapter, we are disap
pointed with our probationary sta
tus, as we feel that fraternity hous
es provide a valuable social service
to the Stanford student body
through all-campus parties," Vata

ha said. "However, being limited
in this capacity has allowed our
chapter to focus more of our re
sources towards contributing to
the Stanford community in other
areas. We feel that through adver
sity we have become a stronger
chapter and we are looking for
ward to spring quarter when we
will be able to assume a more com
plete role as a Greek organization
at Stanford."
The board is composed of nine
members appointed by the Inter
fraternity and Intersorority Coun
cils, the African-American Frater
nal and Sororal Association and
the ASSU Senate.

paper and plastic.
These hazards, in addition
to other incidents involving
several members during spring
quarter, prompted the board to
take action.
Because the incidents at
Kappa Sig occurred late last
spring, the judicial board was not
able to hand down a full decision
until last month.
"It has been our practice not to
convene the judicial board during
dead and finals week," Graves said.
"In spite of this, the board decided
to meet and make four-and-a-half
hours of interviews."
Last year's board gathered all of
the information in the case, but
was unable to reach a decision in

time for the end of the school year.
A new board re-examined the case
this year and recommended to
Wais six sanctions against the fra
ternity. These sanctions included
the development of a written lead
ership program.
"There was a concern by the
[board] that in some respects the
leadership of the frat [was] elected
into positions without adequate
training for the positions they
held," Graves said.
In addition to these sanctions,
Wais added the alcohol probation
penalty, perhaps the most severe
sanction for the fraternity.
"At Kappa Sig [sponsored]

functions and events there's an al
cohol probation until the end of
rush this year," said Martin Ruano,
Interfraternity Council president
and resident assistant in the Kappa
Sig house.
Kappa Sig's probation has been
met with mixed reviews from the
student body.
"1 think that Kappa Sig's repu
tation, especially with freshmen, is
suffering because of its probation,"
said one freshman. "Let's face it,
less alcohol means less attention as
far as fi at parties go. Unfortunate
ly, this makes it harder for people
to realize that there are a lot of
good guys there."

Another freshman disagreed,
pointing out that some University
sanctions are necessary to ensure
the safety of party-goers and fra
ternity members.
"It's definitely too bad that
the frat can't have alcoholic par
ties anymore, but I think it sends
a signal that the University will
not tolerate events which are un
safe," the freshman said. "The
sanctions are certainly not exces
sive. f'm sure that the house can
make it until spring without al
coholic parties."
Members of Kappa Sig, while
frustrated to some extent with the
sanctions, seemed to understand

the University's position.
"Last spring we had a couple of
issues that got blown out of pro
portion, and we didn't really han
dle them as well as we should
have," junior Scott Paulson said.
"Obviously 1 disagree with it, but
I'm not really that upset about it.
It conld have been a lot worse."
"We're trying to look for ways to
get parties together without alco
hol," he said.
"As a chapter, we are disap
pointed with our probationary sta
tus, as we feel that fraternity hous
es provide a valuable social service
to the Stanford student body
through all-campus parties," Vata

ha said. "However, being limited
in this capacity has allowed our
chapter to focus more of our re
sources towards contributing to
the Stanford community in other
areas. We feel that through adver
sity we have become a stronger
chapter and we are looking for
ward to spring quarter when we
will be able to assume a more com
plete role as a Greek organization
at Stanford."
The board is composed of nine
members appointed by the Inter
fraternity and Intersorority Coun
cils, the African-American Frater
nal and Sororal Association and
the ASSU Senate.
