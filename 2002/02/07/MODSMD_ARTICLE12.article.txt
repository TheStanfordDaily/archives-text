1968
On Feb. 7, 1968, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about a suggested increase in the num
ber of coeducational campus residences.
"More coeducational houses should be
created next year, the Residence committee
of the Study of Education (SES) recommends
in a preliminary report on campus housing
released today.
"The committee says all fraternities should
eventually abandon selective rush and
women should be allowed to live off-campus.
"Some of the new coed residences
should be established in the existing
women's dormitories, the committee pro
poses. As well as putting men and women in
the same houses, the report urges the Uni
versity to locate men's and women's houses
next to one another.
'"A new comprehensive draw system'
should be used this spring to assign both
men and women to residences, giving pri
ority to on-campus and transfer students
over those now living off-campus, the re
port suggests.
"Other recommendations for 1968-69 in
clude making Toyon Hall coed, increasing
on-campus space for undergraduate men,
establishing an experimental cooperative
residence, and integrating a larger propor
tion of freshman with upperclassmen.
Bottom Line: Hard to tell if SES is the spawn of
Satan or a student's savior. While the ' compre
hensive draw" is the devil, it's hard to complain
when the University helps bring debauchery into
our dorm rooms.
