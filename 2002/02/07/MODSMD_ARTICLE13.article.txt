# Eating habits remain a strong concern among students

evening dining halls is somewhat limited
and not particularly healthy — with
items such as pizza, mozzarella sticks
and quesadillas.
"The Cyber Cafe and Late Night are
the biggest offenders in Stanford Din
ing. Such foods tend to be unhealthy
and greasy," said Adam Nilsen, a peer
health educator in Freshman / Sopho
more College.
Nilsen does, however, applaud Dining
Services for offering food in the evening.
With students frequently waking up in
the late morning and going to bed past
midnight, many find themselves hungry
in the evenings.
"It is better to have five small meals a
day rather than three, and the Cyber Cafe
and Late Night are a step toward that,"
Nilsen said.
Other evening dining options are vend
ing machines, open kitchens, co-ops and
self-ops. Most of these open kitchens in co
ops and self-ops are student-managed but
are only open to residents of the house.
Murray and Yost also have open kitchens.
Stanford Dining Services manages the nu
tritional requirements of and provides
meal plans for only these residences.
Nonetheless, student-run dining facili
ties still offer nutritious options, according
to Nilsen.
"Open kitchens allow you to eat when
you're hungry and that's important nutri
tionally," Nilsen said. "Co-ops and self-ops
tend to be the healthiest. There aren't as

In the midst of classes, athletics, clubs
and parties, good nutrition often takes a
back seat.Housing and Dining Services,
however, strives to offer students a wide va
riety of healthy options.
Meal plans are provided by Dining
Services for eight dining halls. A staff of
classically trained chefs and registered
dietitians monitors each menu, all of
which include daily vegetarian and
vegan options.
"We develop menus that meet a wide
range of nutritional and dietary needs of
students," Associate Director of Residence
Hall University Dining Services RafiTaher
ian said.
The selection around campus varies
widely, however, with some meal plans of
fering traditional buffet style, offers "a-la
carte" and still others operating as student
managed open kitchens.
For instance, the new Wilbur system op
erating on points has proved popular.
"Since the International Marketplace at
Wilbur Dining Hall opened this quarter,
using the a-la-carte meal points system, we
have seen a significant increase in student
participation," Taherian said.
A-la-carte points can also be used at
"Stern's Cyber Cafe" and "Late Night at
Lagunita." These two dining halls are
open for snacks in the evening and at
night. The selection offered at the two

many options, but they're just as healthy."
Despite the healthy dining options that
are available, eating disorders such as
anorexia nervosa and bulimia are common
throughout the United States.
According to Eating Disorders Aware
ness and Prevention, eating disorders affect
1 to 2 percent of the population. Disorders
are more prominent in women than in
men, though occurrences in males are 011
the rise.
Eating disorders are especially
prominent on college campuses. One in
20 college women has an eating disor
der, and 18 percent of college women
have struggled with varying degrees of
bulimia. During their time at college, 91
percent of women diet as an attempt to
control their weight, and 75 percent diet
often or always.
Stanford is no exception.
"Elite institutions such as Stanford re
cruit highly intelligent and extremely
motivated students," said Ashwini Sagar,
women's health and wellness coordina
tor at the Stanford Women's Communi
ty Center. "Ostensibly these young
adults strive for perfection, and often
times this involves a desire for bodily
perfection as well."
Certain aspects of the Stanford dining
system can prove difficult for those suffer
ing from an eating disorder.
For instance, Sagar notes that the tradi
tional buffet style dining "poses a challenge
and is tempting for behaviors such as binge

ing and purging."
The alternate use of the point system in
Manzanita and Wilbur dining halls has also
gotten mixed reactions.
"The point system restricts you. I think
that would encourage under eating,"
Nilsen said.
Sagar disagrees.
"It doesn't necessarily mean that stu
dents will eat less — it often means that

they are more conscious of their choice
with food," Sagar said. "Students tend
to spend a little more time now that it's
not unlimited."
Cowell Student Health Service offers
eating disorders and nutrition workshops
and groups, as well as individualized nutri
tion counseling. Student groups such as
the Peer Nutrition Educators offer simi
lar workshops.

Certain aspects of the Stanford dining

Manzanita and Wilbur dining halls has also

Nilsen said.
Sagar disagrees.

evening dining halls is somewhat limited
and not particularly healthy — with
items such as pizza, mozzarella sticks
and quesadillas.
"The Cyber Cafe and Late Night are
the biggest offenders in Stanford Din
ing. Such foods tend to be unhealthy
and greasy," said Adam Nilsen, a peer
health educator in Freshman / Sopho
more College.
Nilsen does, however, applaud Dining
Services for offering food in the evening.
With students frequently waking up in
the late morning and going to bed past
midnight, many find themselves hungry
in the evenings.
"It is better to have five small meals a
day rather than three, and the Cyber Cafe
and Late Night are a step toward that,"
Nilsen said.
Other evening dining options are vend
ing machines, open kitchens, co-ops and
self-ops. Most of these open kitchens in co
ops and self-ops are student-managed but
are only open to residents of the house.
Murray and Yost also have open kitchens.
Stanford Dining Services manages the nu
tritional requirements of and provides
meal plans for only these residences.
Nonetheless, student-run dining facili
ties still offer nutritious options, according
to Nilsen.
"Open kitchens allow you to eat when
you're hungry and that's important nutri
tionally," Nilsen said. "Co-ops and self-ops
tend to be the healthiest. There aren't as

In the midst of classes, athletics, clubs
and parties, good nutrition often takes a
back seat.Housing and Dining Services,
however, strives to offer students a wide va
riety of healthy options.
Meal plans are provided by Dining
Services for eight dining halls. A staff of
classically trained chefs and registered
dietitians monitors each menu, all of
which include daily vegetarian and
vegan options.
"We develop menus that meet a wide
range of nutritional and dietary needs of
students," Associate Director of Residence
Hall University Dining Services RafiTaher
ian said.
The selection around campus varies
widely, however, with some meal plans of
fering traditional buffet style, offers "a-la
carte" and still others operating as student
managed open kitchens.
For instance, the new Wilbur system op
erating on points has proved popular.
"Since the International Marketplace at
Wilbur Dining Hall opened this quarter,
using the a-la-carte meal points system, we
have seen a significant increase in student
participation," Taherian said.
A-la-carte points can also be used at
"Stern's Cyber Cafe" and "Late Night at
Lagunita." These two dining halls are
open for snacks in the evening and at
night. The selection offered at the two

many options, but they're just as healthy."
Despite the healthy dining options that
are available, eating disorders such as
anorexia nervosa and bulimia are common
throughout the United States.
According to Eating Disorders Aware
ness and Prevention, eating disorders affect
1 to 2 percent of the population. Disorders
are more prominent in women than in
men, though occurrences in males are 011
the rise.
Eating disorders are especially
prominent on college campuses. One in
20 college women has an eating disor
der, and 18 percent of college women
have struggled with varying degrees of
bulimia. During their time at college, 91
percent of women diet as an attempt to
control their weight, and 75 percent diet
often or always.
Stanford is no exception.
"Elite institutions such as Stanford re
cruit highly intelligent and extremely
motivated students," said Ashwini Sagar,
women's health and wellness coordina
tor at the Stanford Women's Communi
ty Center. "Ostensibly these young
