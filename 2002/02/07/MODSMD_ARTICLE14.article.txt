# BASES to host startup-company job fair
## Silicon Valley Companies visit Stanford in search of future employees 
### SANTOSH ANAGOL RYAN TIMMONS CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
The BASES Startup Job Fair will feature
Silicon Valley start-up companies that are
looking to hire students. The event will intro
duce entrepreneurial job-seekers at Stanford
to a range of pre-initial public offering tech
nology start-ups. It will take place Feb. 9
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m, on the second floor of
Tresidder Union.
According to junior Brian Chang, a fair
organizer, many students come to the job
fair to update their knowledge of business
and technology.
"Although the shaky nature of startup fi
nance has convinced some students to fol
low more traditional post-graduate paths
— such as investment, banking or consult
ing this year — others still view the startup
as the most exciting way to apply a Stanford
education and be a part of the cutting-edge
of new business ideas and technologies,"
Chang said.
"Startup companies attract me because

they offer young employees the chance to
make a meaningful difference in strategic de
cision making and company growth," senior
Burak Over said.
But there is some uncertainty as to
whether startup companies are hiring this
year. United States markets lost an esti
mated $1.68 trillion this year, as the Dow
Jones and NASDAQ indexes declined in
consecutive years for the first time in near
ly three decades.
Still, there are signs that the future of
startups is brightening. The National Ven
ture Capital Association reported 36 IPOs of
venture-backed companies for the fourth
quarter of 2001, tripling the previous quar
ter's 12 offerings.
The first BASES Startup Job Fair was held
in March 1998, as a way to offer start-up op
portunities to Stanford stucfents. Since most
Stanford job fairs primarily featured well-es
tablished companies, the job fair was an op
portunity to put start-ups in the spotlight,
said Katya Falakshahi, who founded the fair
while she was at Stanford and is now a princi
pal at New Enterprise Associates.
"A job lair focused on startup companies
not only provides a medium for these compa
nies to get high visibility within the Stanford
community, but would provide students who
are interested in the unique experiences,
challenges and rewards of working in star

tups to get access to a group of top-tier com
panies," Falakshahi said.
Manual Morales from ACCESS Systems
America, a Silicon Valley provider of software
for non-PC Internet devices, explained how
startup computer companies could also ben
efit from the event.
"Fora fast growing company like ACCESS
Systems America, participation in the BASES
Startup Job Fair gives us tremendous expo
sure to a highly qualified prospective em
ployee pool without tremendous expense,"
Morales said.
"This year we have an exciting mix of
high quality up-and-coming companies
from various industries in high tech," said
Gokce Yucealpan, a masters student in man
agement science and engineering and fair
vice-president.
This year's tight labor market has definite
ly made organizing the job fair a more chal
lenging task for fair officers, Yucealpan said.
Unlike past years, when companies were de
nied spots at the fair, organizers this year
have struggled to find those who are hiring.
Job fair participants this year are mostly
Internet and computing companies, with a
fairly even distribution between hardware
and software companies, according to
Yucealpan.
A list of participating companies is available
on the BASES website (bases.stanford.edu).
