SALT LAKE CITY (AP) —
The tattered American flag recov
ered from the World Trade Cen
ter rubble will be carried at the
Winter Olympics' opening cere
mony in a compromise of patrio
tism and protocol.
American athletes, joined by an
honor guard of police officers and
firefighters, will carry the flag at
Friday night's ceremony in a
"solemn, dignified entrance," the
International Olympic Committee
said Wednesday, reversing an ear
lier decision.
Barring bad weather, the deli
cate banner will then be raised be
side the Olympic flame at Rice-Ec
cles Stadium while "The Star-
Spangled Banner" is played.
The ground zero flag will not be
part of the main parade of athletes
during the opening ceremony and
instead will be carried in after all
teams have entered the stadium.
Still, it will be the official
U.S. flag of the Winter Games,
at the center of an event with an
estimated 3 billion people

watching worldwide.
"We had a great deal of discus
sion as to how to honor the flag as
a symbol of the heroes of Sept.
11,"said Mitt Romney, president
of the Salt Lake Organizing Com
mittee, who criticized the lOC's
original decision." This is a way to
honor the Hag and honor the
Olympians as a world event."
The lOC originally said Amer
ican athletes would not he allowed
to carry the Hag, but that it could
be raised as the official U.S. flag at
the opening ceremony. The lOC
said the plan proposed by the U.S.
Olympic Committee violated
rules barring political acts during
the ceremony.
The decision brought quick
criticism. The topic was discussed
on talk shows nationwide and the
USOC received more than 75 e
mails and dozens of telephone
calls at its Colorado Springs,
Colo., headquarters.
Romney even issued a state
ment that he "respectfully dis
agreed" with the lOC's decision.
