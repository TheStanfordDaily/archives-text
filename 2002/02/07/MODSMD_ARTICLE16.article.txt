## The 						Stanford Daily IHUM program review must be independent 
### 
Published Since J 891

Next year, the Faculty Senate will re
ceive a review of the Introduction
to the Humanities program.
While the Faculty Senate is the ap
propriate body to receive the final program
evaluation, neither the office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education nor
the office of the IHUM program itself—
which are planning to conduct the review of
the program — should carry out the review
because of conflicts of interest.
The office of the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education pays the costs of IHUM.
The program falls under the supervision of
the vice provost. If that same office conducts
the review, there will be a conflict of interest,
or at least the appearance of one, which is
tantamount to a real conflict. In order to
guarantee the best possible program to stu-

dents, the University must avoid this.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman has already declared the
program "absolutely a success." The Vice
Provost's office has already issued a positive
review — before the review process has even
begun. It is clear that someone who has had
little previous involvement with the program
should be brought in to evaluate it.
IHUM is a unique program at Stanford.
An internal review will not be careful or fair.
Unlike undergraduate majors in the School
of Humanities and Sciences, there is no cur
riculum committee to hold jurisdiction over
the review. The Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences holds no effective control over IHUM.
The program is so large — and so unique —
that it must be reviewed differently.
We urge the Vice Provost's office to commis

sion a full and independent review of the
IHUM program, similar to that which the
Language Center undergoes. Experts from
other universities should be brought in to re
view the program, and faculty members unaf
filiated with IHUM must comprise part of the
internal component of the review committee.
In addition, and perhaps most important
ly, there must be a real venue for student
input on the program. Multiple-choice-style
evaluations do not solicit actual student input.
Students must be allowed to speak with the
evaluating committee, and student member
ship on the committee is necessary.
It is distressing that the dffice of the Vice
Provost and the IHUM program bureaucra
cy seem to be ignoring the input of concerned
student-members of the Freedom Forum.

terested student groups, should be an impor
tant part of the review process.
The review committee should take the opin
ions of all years of undergraduate students into
account. The hindsight of older students about
what the IHUM program provided them
within the context of their undergraduate ed
ucation is certainly valuable. A senior may be
better able to decide whether his IHUM expe
rience were a productive learning experience
than a freshman. Some courses may be enjoy
able and well-taught, but at the same time may
lack substance. A senior might be able to con
textualize this better than a freshman.
It is important that the review of the pro
gram be conducted in a fair and impartial
manner. Only in that way can the evaluation
uncover the true successes and failures of the
IHUM program.
