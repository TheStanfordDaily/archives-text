Ostensible reason for tuition increase
'deceptive, divisive and malicious'
I believe that the reasoning the Board
of Trustees and the University gave for
increasing tuition is absolutely false and
divisive. The Board of Trustees essen
tially argued that tuition must be in
creased in order to maintain our need
blind admissions policy at Stanford.
This reasoning not only polarizes the
student body based on class and race,
but also succeeds in disguising the in
creasing corporatization of this Univer
sity. Basically, it's just not true.
The reality is that Stanford has tons of
money — there is a $8 billion endowment,
the "Think Again" Campaign for Under
graduate Education project will raise an
other $1 billion and Stanford boasts that it
is one of the top ten fundraising institu
tions in the nation.
Stanford has an incredible amount of
money at its disposal. We are loaded. This
place is a business, a money-making, fund
raising machine.
Why not say that tuition is being in
creased so that we can plant more palm
trees? Why not say tuition is being in
creased so that some engineering building
can be rebuilt? Why not say that tuition is
increasing so that Wilbur Dining Hall can
be turned into a Spago?
The University has thousands of ways
in which it spends ridiculous amounts of
money — so why isn't the tuition increase
attributed to any one of those reasons?
They attribute an increase in tuition to
financial aid because jio one would even
begin to suggest that Stanford does not
need to increase tuition if that would
somehow mean decreasing financial aid.

Stanford is using the needs of students
of color and lower socio-economic status
as a cover for increasing tuition just to get
more money out of us.
If diversity is really valued at Stanford,
why was the Latin American Studies pro
gram cut? Why was there a move to con
solidate all language programs? Why is
there an insanely small number of profes
sors of color?
The University should not use the se
rious demands of students of color and
of lower socioeconomic status to justify
increasing tuition, especially when it
does not even need to increase tuition;
such an argument is deceptive, divisive
and malicious.

respond to East Palo Alto series
We would like to commend The Daily
for its efforts to raise awareness within the
Stanford community regarding the East
Palo Alto community through the four
part series entitled "Focus on East Palo
Alto." During the series, the Daily selected
some of the most complex and controver
sial issues going on in the community,
most recently referring to East Palo Alto as
a "drug haven."
This is certainly a trend that the media
has taken with EPA, but we hope that this is
not a reflection of the University's only in
terests in the EPA community. Since being
dubbed the country's "murder capital" in
1992, EPA has changed a lot, and we would
like to point out a few important facts that

will hopefully provide you and your read
ers with greater insight on the community.
As noted in the Daily's most recent ar
ticle, "labeling East Palo Alto a 'drug
haven' doesn't tell the whole story." Yet,
the article itself only served to reinforce
the view of East Palo Alto as a 'drug haven'
for those at Stanford and in other neigh
boring communities seeking drugs.
As a person quoted in the article,
Lieutenant Rahn Sibley is particularly
concerned that several of his comments
were taken out of context or misquoted.
First, he was quoted as suggesting that
"citizens of other surrounding commu
nities also use East Palo Alto dealers as
their suppliers." Lieutenant Sibley's
point was that East Palo Alto is not the
only community selling drugs and that
other communities are also selling some
of the drugs on the market.
Second, the article quotes Lieutenant
Sibley as noting "that violence stems from
competition among dealers." While this
may have been the case in the early
19905, violent crime in the community
has been due to a variety of factors and is
not solely based on drug deals anymore.
Finally, we hope that you and your
readers recognize that most people at
Stanford who go to East Palo Alto are not
there for the purpose of buying drugs,
l hese Stanford students, staff, faculty and
alumni may be residents of the city, or are
working with the East Palo Alto communi
ty as volunteers, interns, board members,
fundraisers, and researchers.
In the three articles that mentioned
population figures for East Palo Alto, the
Daily referenced figures identified as
being from 1992 estimates by the San Jose
Mercury News. To update you and your
readers, the 2000 Census figures estimate
East Palo Alto's total population to be at
29,506 people. Between the 1990 Census
and 2000 Census, the city has grown by
6,055 people (+25.8%). With this increase
in population, there also have been some
major changes in ethnic distribution, re
flected primarily in the significant growth
of the Latino population to 8,819 people
(+103.4%) and the decrease in the num
ber ol African-Americans community by
1,380 people (-14.2%).
In the first article of the series, which fo
cused on construction in East Palo Alto, the
descript i< >n of Whiskey Gulch was also based
on the early '90s and described as "a strip
mall of liquor stores, locally-owned fast
food joints and abandoned storefronts."
Among the businesses and apartments
that were closed and / or relocated by Jan
uary 2000 to make room for the new Uni
versity Circle development in Whiskey
Gulch were several nonprofit agencies
that serve the East Palo Alto community.

These agencies included: Ecumenical
Hunger Program, Free at Last, Open
Voice, Pacific Islander Outreach, Plugged
In, Start Up and Youth United for Com
munity Action (YUCA).
Several of these agencies were started
by and / or employed Stanford alumni,
and all of them hosted Stanford student
interns and through service
learning classes, fellowship programs,
and community service programs at
Stanford University.
Like us, there are many Stanford stu
dents, staff, faculty and alumni who have
been working with members of the East
Palo Alto community to ensure that a sin
gle year as the 'nation's murder capitol'
one decade ago did not determine East
Palo Alto's destiny.
We hope that you and your readers will
join our efforts by continuing to learn
about the East Palo Alto community, or
even becoming interns or volunteers
through the many service organizations
and/or service-learning opportunities that
connect the University with East Palo Alto.

Ruvolo 'didn't follow the girl rules'
This afternoon, I got a link from a guy
I know at Stanford to Julie Ruvolo's col
umn about frat parties "breaking the
rules". You may ask why a Duke student
— someone on a college campus all the
way across the country — even cared to
read an article in The Daily, and you
would bejustified in asking that question,
but there were a few things in that col
umn that begged a response.
First of all, when I got my "Frat Guy
Handbook," Ruvolo's rules were not
sandwiched in among the easy Natty
Light Punch recipes and trite pickup
lines. She should have brought her jacket
to the freshman party. Research has
proven that black pants have almost no
insulative properties, and I'm sure one of
the guys would have been happy to hang
her jacket in his closet — and maybe even
take the time to "show her his room" —
because who wouldn't want to hook up
with her?
And as for the whole didn't-call-in-ad
vance-to-a-party-with-a-guest-list fiasco?
If Ruvolo showed up at a movie theater
without a ticket, claimed that her best
girlfriend was dating the popcorn guy, or
even suggested that the zitty kid at the

candy counter wanted to hook up with
her, they'd chase her out of there and pelt
her with gummy bears.
Ruvolo didn't follow the girl rules,
which include: first, not showing up to a
closed party where you hadn't been invit
ed, regardless of who you've hooked up
with on the inside; and second, don't as
sume a guy wants to hook up with you
until you've given him a thorough sam
pling of your columns.

Student, alum laud Drue Kataoka
When I entered Stanford as a fresh
man in the fall of 1997, I had never
heard of the sumi-e school of art. It was
not until later that year when I first saw
Drue Kataoka's artwork spread across
campus. I became an instant fan and
would look forward to surprise oppor
tunities to see new works at basketball
games or in student art shows in White
Plaza.
I applaud Kataoka for taking the ini
tiative to expose herself to the young chil
dren of the Bay Area. Her efforts to

spread sumi-e to the world are com
mendable. Even if Afghan children have
little food to eat and few books to read,
they will be comforted with a precious
piece of art that is so profoundly depict
ing their, and our, human condition.
ARTHUR W. lAUF.R
Class of2001

Having entered Stanford in the same
year as Drue Kataoka, I was privileged to
see her art develop during her lime at
Stanford and am heartened to see that
she continues to bring the healing power
of sumi-e to the community at large.
Other than from food, shelter and
safety from land mines, 1 can think of lit
tle that would benefit Afghan children
more than Kataoka's art.
"Highway Hopscotch" will build a
sumi-e bridge of understanding and
compassion between Islam and the West.
If Ms. Kataoka had been painting a gen
eration ago, perhaps there would be
peace on earth today.

be turned into a Spago?
The University has thousands of ways
in which it spends ridiculous amounts of
money — so why isn't the tuition increase
attributed to any one of those reasons?
They attribute an increase in tuition to
financial aid because jio one would even
begin to suggest that Stanford does not
need to increase tuition if that would
somehow mean decreasing financial aid.

Stanford is using the needs of students
of color and lower socio-economic status
as a cover for increasing tuition just to get
more money out of us.
If diversity is really valued at Stanford,
why was the Latin American Studies pro
gram cut? Why was there a move to con
solidate all language programs? Why is
there an insanely small number of profes
sors of color?
The University should not use the se
rious demands of students of color and
of lower socioeconomic status to justify
increasing tuition, especially when it
does not even need to increase tuition;
such an argument is deceptive, divisive
and malicious.

respond to East Palo Alto series
We would like to commend The Daily
for its efforts to raise awareness within the
Stanford community regarding the East
Palo Alto community through the four
part series entitled "Focus on East Palo
Alto." During the series, the Daily selected
some of the most complex and controver
sial issues going on in the community,
most recently referring to East Palo Alto as
a "drug haven."
This is certainly a trend that the media
has taken with EPA, but we hope that this is
not a reflection of the University's only in
terests in the EPA community. Since being
dubbed the country's "murder capital" in
1992, EPA has changed a lot, and we would
like to point out a few important facts that

will hopefully provide you and your read
ers with greater insight on the community.
As noted in the Daily's most recent ar
ticle, "labeling East Palo Alto a 'drug
haven' doesn't tell the whole story." Yet,
the article itself only served to reinforce
the view of East Palo Alto as a 'drug haven'
for those at Stanford and in other neigh
boring communities seeking drugs.
As a person quoted in the article,
Lieutenant Rahn Sibley is particularly
concerned that several of his comments
were taken out of context or misquoted.
First, he was quoted as suggesting that
"citizens of other surrounding commu
nities also use East Palo Alto dealers as
their suppliers." Lieutenant Sibley's
point was that East Palo Alto is not the
only community selling drugs and that
other communities are also selling some
of the drugs on the market.
Second, the article quotes Lieutenant
Sibley as noting "that violence stems from
competition among dealers." While this
may have been the case in the early
19905, violent crime in the community
has been due to a variety of factors and is
not solely based on drug deals anymore.
Finally, we hope that you and your
readers recognize that most people at
Stanford who go to East Palo Alto are not
there for the purpose of buying drugs,
l hese Stanford students, staff, faculty and
alumni may be residents of the city, or are
working with the East Palo Alto communi
ty as volunteers, interns, board members,
fundraisers, and researchers.
In the three articles that mentioned
population figures for East Palo Alto, the
Daily referenced figures identified as
being from 1992 estimates by the San Jose
Mercury News. To update you and your
readers, the 2000 Census figures estimate
East Palo Alto's total population to be at
29,506 people. Between the 1990 Census
and 2000 Census, the city has grown by
6,055 people (+25.8%). With this increase
in population, there also have been some
major changes in ethnic distribution, re
flected primarily in the significant growth
of the Latino population to 8,819 people
(+103.4%) and the decrease in the num
ber ol African-Americans community by
1,380 people (-14.2%).
In the first article of the series, which fo
cused on construction in East Palo Alto, the
descript i< >n of Whiskey Gulch was also based
on the early '90s and described as "a strip
mall of liquor stores, locally-owned fast
food joints and abandoned storefronts."
Among the businesses and apartments
that were closed and / or relocated by Jan
uary 2000 to make room for the new Uni
versity Circle development in Whiskey
Gulch were several nonprofit agencies
that serve the East Palo Alto community.

These agencies included: Ecumenical
Hunger Program, Free at Last, Open
Voice, Pacific Islander Outreach, Plugged
In, Start Up and Youth United for Com
munity Action (YUCA).
Several of these agencies were started
by and / or employed Stanford alumni,
and all of them hosted Stanford student
interns and through service
learning classes, fellowship programs,
and community service programs at
Stanford University.
Like us, there are many Stanford stu
dents, staff, faculty and alumni who have
been working with members of the East
Palo Alto community to ensure that a sin
gle year as the 'nation's murder capitol'
one decade ago did not determine East
Palo Alto's destiny.
We hope that you and your readers will
join our efforts by continuing to learn
about the East Palo Alto community, or
even becoming interns or volunteers
through the many service organizations
and/or service-learning opportunities that
connect the University with East Palo Alto.

Ruvolo 'didn't follow the girl rules'
This afternoon, I got a link from a guy
I know at Stanford to Julie Ruvolo's col
umn about frat parties "breaking the
rules". You may ask why a Duke student
— someone on a college campus all the
way across the country — even cared to
read an article in The Daily, and you
would bejustified in asking that question,
but there were a few things in that col
umn that begged a response.
First of all, when I got my "Frat Guy
Handbook," Ruvolo's rules were not
sandwiched in among the easy Natty
Light Punch recipes and trite pickup
lines. She should have brought her jacket
to the freshman party. Research has
proven that black pants have almost no
insulative properties, and I'm sure one of
the guys would have been happy to hang
her jacket in his closet — and maybe even
take the time to "show her his room" —
because who wouldn't want to hook up
with her?
And as for the whole didn't-call-in-ad
vance-to-a-party-with-a-guest-list fiasco?
If Ruvolo showed up at a movie theater
without a ticket, claimed that her best
girlfriend was dating the popcorn guy, or
even suggested that the zitty kid at the

candy counter wanted to hook up with
her, they'd chase her out of there and pelt
her with gummy bears.
Ruvolo didn't follow the girl rules,
which include: first, not showing up to a
closed party where you hadn't been invit
ed, regardless of who you've hooked up
with on the inside; and second, don't as
sume a guy wants to hook up with you
until you've given him a thorough sam
pling of your columns.

Student, alum laud Drue Kataoka
When I entered Stanford as a fresh
man in the fall of 1997, I had never
heard of the sumi-e school of art. It was
not until later that year when I first saw
Drue Kataoka's artwork spread across
campus. I became an instant fan and
would look forward to surprise oppor
tunities to see new works at basketball
games or in student art shows in White
Plaza.
I applaud Kataoka for taking the ini
tiative to expose herself to the young chil
dren of the Bay Area. Her efforts to

spread sumi-e to the world are com
mendable. Even if Afghan children have
little food to eat and few books to read,
they will be comforted with a precious
piece of art that is so profoundly depict
ing their, and our, human condition.
ARTHUR W. lAUF.R

Having entered Stanford in the same
year as Drue Kataoka, I was privileged to
see her art develop during her lime at
Stanford and am heartened to see that
she continues to bring the healing power
of sumi-e to the community at large.
Other than from food, shelter and
safety from land mines, 1 can think of lit
tle that would benefit Afghan children
more than Kataoka's art.
"Highway Hopscotch" will build a
sumi-e bridge of understanding and
compassion between Islam and the West.
If Ms. Kataoka had been painting a gen
eration ago, perhaps there would be
peace on earth today.

Ostensible reason for tuition increase
'deceptive, divisive and malicious'
I believe that the reasoning the Board
of Trustees and the University gave for
increasing tuition is absolutely false and
divisive. The Board of Trustees essen
tially argued that tuition must be in
creased in order to maintain our need
blind admissions policy at Stanford.
This reasoning not only polarizes the
student body based on class and race,
but also succeeds in disguising the in
creasing corporatization of this Univer
sity. Basically, it's just not true.
The reality is that Stanford has tons of
money — there is a $8 billion endowment,
the "Think Again" Campaign for Under
graduate Education project will raise an
other $1 billion and Stanford boasts that it
is one of the top ten fundraising institu
tions in the nation.
Stanford has an incredible amount of
money at its disposal. We are loaded. This
place is a business, a money-making, fund
raising machine.
Why not say that tuition is being in
creased so that we can plant more palm
trees? Why not say tuition is being in
creased so that some engineering building
can be rebuilt? Why not say that tuition is
increasing so that Wilbur Dining Hall can
be turned into a Spago?
The University has thousands of ways
in which it spends ridiculous amounts of

Stanford community regarding the East
Palo Alto community through the four
part series entitled "Focus on East Palo
Alto." During the series, the Daily selected
some of the most complex and controver
sial issues going on in the community,
most recently referring to East Palo Alto as
a "drug haven."
This is certainly a trend that the media
has taken with EPA, but we hope that this is
not a reflection of the University's only in
terests in the EPA community. Since being
dubbed the country's "murder capital" in
1992, EPA has changed a lot, and we would
like to point out a few important facts that

will hopefully provide you and your read
ers with greater insight on the community.
As noted in the Daily's most recent ar
ticle, "labeling East Palo Alto a 'drug
haven' doesn't tell the whole story." Yet,
the article itself only served to reinforce
the view of East Palo Alto as a 'drug haven'
for those at Stanford and in other neigh
boring communities seeking drugs.
As a person quoted in the article,
Lieutenant Rahn Sibley is particularly
concerned that several of his comments
were taken out of context or misquoted.
First, he was quoted as suggesting that
"citizens of other surrounding commu
nities also use East Palo Alto dealers as
their suppliers." Lieutenant Sibley's
point was that East Palo Alto is not the
only community selling drugs and that
other communities are also selling some
of the drugs on the market.
Second, the article quotes Lieutenant
Sibley as noting "that violence stems from
competition among dealers." While this
may have been the case in the early
19905, violent crime in the community
has been due to a variety of factors and is
not solely based on drug deals anymore.
Finally, we hope that you and your
readers recognize that most people at
Stanford who go to East Palo Alto are not
there for the purpose of buying drugs,
l hese Stanford students, staff, faculty and
alumni may be residents of the city, or are
working with the East Palo Alto communi
ty as volunteers, interns, board members,
fundraisers, and researchers.
In the three articles that mentioned
population figures for East Palo Alto, the
Daily referenced figures identified as
being from 1992 estimates by the San Jose
Mercury News. To update you and your
readers, the 2000 Census figures estimate
East Palo Alto's total population to be at
29,506 people. Between the 1990 Census
and 2000 Census, the city has grown by
6,055 people (+25.8%). With this increase
in population, there also have been some
major changes in ethnic distribution, re
flected primarily in the significant growth
of the Latino population to 8,819 people
(+103.4%) and the decrease in the num
ber ol African-Americans community by
1,380 people (-14.2%).
In the first article of the series, which fo
cused on construction in East Palo Alto, the
descript i< >n of Whiskey Gulch was also based
on the early '90s and described as "a strip
mall of liquor stores, locally-owned fast
food joints and abandoned storefronts."
Among the businesses and apartments
that were closed and / or relocated by Jan
uary 2000 to make room for the new Uni
versity Circle development in Whiskey
Gulch were several nonprofit agencies
that serve the East Palo Alto community.

These agencies included: Ecumenical
Hunger Program, Free at Last, Open
Voice, Pacific Islander Outreach, Plugged
In, Start Up and Youth United for Com
munity Action (YUCA).
Several of these agencies were started
by and / or employed Stanford alumni,
and all of them hosted Stanford student
interns and through service
learning classes, fellowship programs,
and community service programs at
Stanford University.
Like us, there are many Stanford stu
dents, staff, faculty and alumni who have
been working with members of the East
Palo Alto community to ensure that a sin
gle year as the 'nation's murder capitol'
one decade ago did not determine East
Palo Alto's destiny.
We hope that you and your readers will
join our efforts by continuing to learn
about the East Palo Alto community, or
even becoming interns or volunteers
through the many service organizations
and/or service-learning opportunities that
connect the University with East Palo Alto.

Ruvolo 'didn't follow the girl rules'
This afternoon, I got a link from a guy
I know at Stanford to Julie Ruvolo's col
umn about frat parties "breaking the
rules". You may ask why a Duke student
— someone on a college campus all the
way across the country — even cared to
read an article in The Daily, and you
would bejustified in asking that question,
but there were a few things in that col
umn that begged a response.
First of all, when I got my "Frat Guy
Handbook," Ruvolo's rules were not
sandwiched in among the easy Natty
Light Punch recipes and trite pickup
lines. She should have brought her jacket
to the freshman party. Research has
proven that black pants have almost no
insulative properties, and I'm sure one of
the guys would have been happy to hang
her jacket in his closet — and maybe even
take the time to "show her his room" —
because who wouldn't want to hook up
with her?
And as for the whole didn't-call-in-ad
vance-to-a-party-with-a-guest-list fiasco?
If Ruvolo showed up at a movie theater
without a ticket, claimed that her best
girlfriend was dating the popcorn guy, or
even suggested that the zitty kid at the

candy counter wanted to hook up with
her, they'd chase her out of there and pelt
her with gummy bears.
Ruvolo didn't follow the girl rules,
which include: first, not showing up to a
closed party where you hadn't been invit
ed, regardless of who you've hooked up
with on the inside; and second, don't as
sume a guy wants to hook up with you
until you've given him a thorough sam
pling of your columns.

Student, alum laud Drue Kataoka
When I entered Stanford as a fresh
man in the fall of 1997, I had never
heard of the sumi-e school of art. It was
not until later that year when I first saw
Drue Kataoka's artwork spread across
campus. I became an instant fan and
would look forward to surprise oppor
tunities to see new works at basketball
games or in student art shows in White
Plaza.
I applaud Kataoka for taking the ini
tiative to expose herself to the young chil
dren of the Bay Area. Her efforts to

spread sumi-e to the world are com
mendable. Even if Afghan children have
little food to eat and few books to read,
they will be comforted with a precious
piece of art that is so profoundly depict
ing their, and our, human condition.
ARTHUR W. lAUF.R

Having entered Stanford in the same
year as Drue Kataoka, I was privileged to
see her art develop during her lime at
Stanford and am heartened to see that
she continues to bring the healing power
of sumi-e to the community at large.
Other than from food, shelter and
safety from land mines, 1 can think of lit
tle that would benefit Afghan children
more than Kataoka's art.
"Highway Hopscotch" will build a
sumi-e bridge of understanding and
compassion between Islam and the West.
If Ms. Kataoka had been painting a gen
eration ago, perhaps there would be
peace on earth today.

Ostensible reason for tuition increase
'deceptive, divisive and malicious'
I believe that the reasoning the Board
of Trustees and the University gave for
increasing tuition is absolutely false and
divisive. The Board of Trustees essen
tially argued that tuition must be in
creased in order to maintain our need
blind admissions policy at Stanford.
This reasoning not only polarizes the
student body based on class and race,
but also succeeds in disguising the in
creasing corporatization of this Univer
sity. Basically, it's just not true.
The reality is that Stanford has tons of
money — there is a $8 billion endowment,
the "Think Again" Campaign for Under
graduate Education project will raise an
other $1 billion and Stanford boasts that it
is one of the top ten fundraising institu
tions in the nation.
Stanford has an incredible amount of
money at its disposal. We are loaded. This
place is a business, a money-making, fund
raising machine.
Why not say that tuition is being in
creased so that we can plant more palm
trees? Why not say tuition is being in
creased so that some engineering building
can be rebuilt? Why not say that tuition is
increasing so that Wilbur Dining Hall can
be turned into a Spago?
The University has thousands of ways
in which it spends ridiculous amounts of
money — so why isn't the tuition increase
attributed to any one of those reasons?
They attribute an increase in tuition to
financial aid because jio one would even
begin to suggest that Stanford does not
need to increase tuition if that would
somehow mean decreasing financial aid.

Stanford is using the needs of students
of color and lower socio-economic status
as a cover for increasing tuition just to get
more money out of us.
If diversity is really valued at Stanford,
why was the Latin American Studies pro
gram cut? Why was there a move to con
solidate all language programs? Why is
there an insanely small number of profes
sors of color?
The University should not use the se
rious demands of students of color and
of lower socioeconomic status to justify
increasing tuition, especially when it
does not even need to increase tuition;
such an argument is deceptive, divisive
and malicious.
