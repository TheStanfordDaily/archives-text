Ostensible reason for tuition increase
'deceptive, divisive and malicious'
I believe that the reasoning the Board
of Trustees and the University gave for
increasing tuition is absolutely false and
divisive. The Board of Trustees essen
tially argued that tuition must be in
creased in order to maintain our need
blind admissions policy at Stanford.
This reasoning not only polarizes the
student body based on class and race,
but also succeeds in disguising the in
creasing corporatization of this Univer
sity. Basically, it's just not true.
The reality is that Stanford has tons of
money — there is a $8 billion endowment,
the "Think Again" Campaign for Under
graduate Education project will raise an
other $1 billion and Stanford boasts that it
is one of the top ten fundraising institu
tions in the nation.
Stanford has an incredible amount of
money at its disposal. We are loaded. This
place is a business, a money-making, fund
raising machine.
Why not say that tuition is being in
creased so that we can plant more palm
trees? Why not say tuition is being in
creased so that some engineering building
can be rebuilt? Why not say that tuition is
increasing so that Wilbur Dining Hall can
be turned into a Spago?
The University has thousands of ways
in which it spends ridiculous amounts of
money — so why isn't the tuition increase
attributed to any one of those reasons?
They attribute an increase in tuition to
financial aid because jio one would even
begin to suggest that Stanford does not
need to increase tuition if that would
somehow mean decreasing financial aid.

Stanford is using the needs of students
of color and lower socio-economic status
as a cover for increasing tuition just to get
more money out of us.
If diversity is really valued at Stanford,
why was the Latin American Studies pro
gram cut? Why was there a move to con
solidate all language programs? Why is
there an insanely small number of profes
sors of color?
The University should not use the se
rious demands of students of color and
of lower socioeconomic status to justify
increasing tuition, especially when it
does not even need to increase tuition;
such an argument is deceptive, divisive
and malicious.

respond to East Palo Alto series
We would like to commend The Daily
for its efforts to raise awareness within the
Stanford community regarding the East
Palo Alto community through the four
part series entitled "Focus on East Palo
Alto." During the series, the Daily selected
some of the most complex and controver
sial issues going on in the community,
most recently referring to East Palo Alto as
a "drug haven."
This is certainly a trend that the media
has taken with EPA, but we hope that this is
not a reflection of the University's only in
terests in the EPA community. Since being
dubbed the country's "murder capital" in
1992, EPA has changed a lot, and we would
like to point out a few important facts that

will hopefully provide you and your read
ers with greater insight on the community.
As noted in the Daily's most recent ar
ticle, "labeling East Palo Alto a 'drug
haven' doesn't tell the whole story." Yet,
the article itself only served to reinforce
the view of East Palo Alto as a 'drug haven'
for those at Stanford and in other neigh
boring communities seeking drugs.
As a person quoted in the article,
Lieutenant Rahn Sibley is particularly
concerned that several of his comments
were taken out of context or misquoted.
First, he was quoted as suggesting that
"citizens of other surrounding commu
nities also use East Palo Alto dealers as
their suppliers." Lieutenant Sibley's
point was that East Palo Alto is not the
only community selling drugs and that
other communities are also selling some
of the drugs on the market.
Second, the article quotes Lieutenant
Sibley as noting "that violence stems from
competition among dealers." While this
may have been the case in the early
19905, violent crime in the community
has been due to a variety of factors and is
not solely based on drug deals anymore.
Finally, we hope that you and your
readers recognize that most people at
Stanford who go to East Palo Alto are not
there for the purpose of buying drugs,
l hese Stanford students, staff, faculty and
alumni may be residents of the city, or are
working with the East Palo Alto communi
ty as volunteers, interns, board members,
fundraisers, and researchers.
In the three articles that mentioned
population figures for East Palo Alto, the
Daily referenced figures identified as
