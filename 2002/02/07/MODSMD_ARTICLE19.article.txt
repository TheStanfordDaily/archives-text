# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Israel and the world have taken away rights of Palestinians 
### TAREK HAMMAM PETE BLAUSTEIN GUEST COLUMNISTS 
I he world has betrayed the Palestini
an people. From the Six Day War on, the
U.N. has passed numerous resolutions
calling for the equal treatment of Pales
tinian people. Specifically, U.N. resolu
tions 242 and 338 guarantee "territorial
inviolability and political independence
of every State in the area."
Since then, Israel has consistently de
nied Palestinian aspirations for political,
economic, and territorial freedom. For
example, the Israelis have put such tight
clamps on Palestinian travel and trade

that it is cheaper to import tomatoes from
Spain to the West Bank than it is from
Gaza, according to Columbia University
Prof. Edward Said. Currently, Yasir
Arafat, the chairman of the PLO, is not
permitted to leave his house — it is
guarded by an Israeli tank. Israel's occu
pation has affected over 75 percent of
Palestinian territory, including East
Jerusalem. As a result, the suffering in
the West Bank and Gaza is unimaginable.
Ambulances with dying patients are
stopped at border controls to look for ex
plosives. Much of the population lives in
rotting refugee camps set up in 1967.
The dignity of the Palestinian people is
constantly trampled.

Recently, about 100 veteran Israeli
soldiers signed a petition refusing to 112 ur
ther serve in the West Bank or Gaza.
Their reason? "We will no longer fight
beyond the Green Line [Israel's pre
-1967 border] with the purpose of con
trolling, expelling, starving and humili
ating an entire people."
Indeed, some soldiers felt that their
actions constituted war crimes. In a radio
poll conducted by Radio Israel, 30 per
cent of respondents supported the
reservists' cause.
Flow can it be that the Palestinians have
placed their trust in the world, only to end
up being starved and humiliated? Given
28 years of military occupation, the delib

erate wrecking of the economy and in
frastructure, the active humiliation of an
entire people, the enormous number ol
murdered Palestinians, it surprises us that
the Palestinians still want to give the world
another chance. We can't let them down.
People are suffering, and all anybody
wants to talk about is the leadership.
What about the people?
Palestine-Israel is not an ordinary bit
of geography: it is more saturated in reli
gious, historical and cultural significance
than any place on Earth. It is also now the
place, where two peoples, whether they
like it or not, live inextricably linked lives
tied together by history, war, daily con
tact and suffering.

Silence is not a response, and neither
is some fair ly tepid endorsement of a
Palestinian state, with Israeli settlements
and army more or less still there and still
in charge.
Israel has no future unless its people
are a real part of the Middle East, not its
soldiers or its politicians. Talking of sep
aration is nothing less than providing
prescriptions for more violence and
degradation. There is no substitute for
seeing these two communities as equal to
each other in rights and expectations.
