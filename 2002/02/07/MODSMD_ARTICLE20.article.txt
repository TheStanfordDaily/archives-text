## Card tennis ready to net victory

In most sports, teams tend to prefer warming up
to the real competition by taking their aggression
out on traditionally weaker teams at the onset of

Today-Sunday: National Team Indoor Cham
pionships from Louisville, Ky.

With only one dual meet victory under its belt so
far, the Cardinal (1-0) will be "warming up" against
the likes of Georgia, UCLA, Mississippi and Ten

Team Indoor Championships in Louisville, Ky..
Fans will certainly not be able to see the same col

serve as the Cardinal's largest obstacles in its pursuit
of a twelfth National Team Indoor title â€” the most of
any team in the country.

mind, but it's even more dangerous when that squad
has all the talent and heart to win.
More than likely, the lineups for both teams will use
similar lineups to what they used in last weekend's match.
At No. 1 singles, top-ranked senior co-captain K.J.
Llippensteel (7-0) will play llth-ranked Oliver
Maiberger for the third time this season. This
matchup will be the one to watch, not only for its ex
hibition of great talent, but also for the rivalry that has
been developing between the two players. So far,
Hippensteel has gotten the better of Maiberger both
times this season.
If Stanford head coach Dick Gould decides to imple-
