## Card tennis ready to net victory 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
In most sports, teams tend to prefer warming up
to the real competition by taking their aggression
out on traditionally weaker teams at the onset of
the season.
Not the men's tennis team, though.

Today-Sunday: National Team Indoor Cham
pionships from Louisville, Ky.

With only one dual meet victory under its belt so
far, the Cardinal (1-0) will be "warming up" against
the likes of Georgia, UCLA, Mississippi and Ten
nessee, all top-10 teams, this weekend at the National
Team Indoor Championships in Louisville, Ky..
Fans will certainly not be able to see the same col
lection of talent and fierce competition until the
NCAA Championships in three months.
The Cardinal, ranked second in the nation, will
compete among a field of 16 teams, including every
squad ranked from first to twelfth in the nation, who
will all be vying for bragging rights.
Defending tournament champion No. 3 UCLA
and defending NCAA champion No. 1 Georgia will
serve as the Cardinal's largest obstacles in its pursuit
of a twelfth National Team Indoor title — the most of
any team in the country.
Ironically, Stanford's opponent in the first round
today will be 48th-ranked San Diego State, whom the
Cardinal played last Saturday in its 2002 season/
home opener.
Although Stanford won that match handily, 6-1,
don't expect the Aztecs (2-1) to be intimidated. It is al
ways dangerous to play a team that has revenge on its
mind, but it's even more dangerous when that squad
has all the talent and heart to win.
More than likely, the lineups for both teams will use
similar lineups to what they used in last weekend's match.
At No. 1 singles, top-ranked senior co-captain K.J.
Llippensteel (7-0) will play llth-ranked Oliver
Maiberger for the third time this season. This
matchup will be the one to watch, not only for its ex
hibition of great talent, but also for the rivalry that has
been developing between the two players. So far,
Hippensteel has gotten the better of Maiberger both
times this season.

Ryan Haviland and the No. 2 Cardinal head to Louisville, Ky., today to begin the first round of
the National Indoor Team Championships. Stanford will face San Diego State in the first round.
ment the same lineup as he did in
the last match, the Nos. 2-6 slots will
be filled by juniors David Martin (7-
3), Scott Lipsky (11-6), Ryan Havi
land (9-3), and freshmen Phil
Sheng (5-3) and Sam Warburg (9-
5), respectively.
Martin, who is the other co-cap
tain and is ranked 49th in the na
tion, and his fellow classmates, No.
31 Lipsky and No. 43 Haviland,
will be vital to the Cardinal's suc
cess throughout the tournament.
With the absence of Carter
Morris, the fourth member of the
much-celebrated 1999 recruiting
class, the team will count on new
faces Sheng and Warburg to step
up into the starting lineup for the
first part of the season.
While the singles action re
ceives most of the hype in a dual
match, the doubles play is perhaps
more important fora team's psy
che because it is played first.
Stanford's pairs of No. 7 Hip
pensteel / Haviland (4-1), No. 3
Lipsky / Martin (10-2) and War
burg / Sheng (4-1) will most
likely play in the three spots for
this tournament.
With a good showing at this
