Football head coach Buddy
Teevens isn't having all that
much trouble adjusting to Stan
ford life. He is already quoting
Professor William Dement of
the Human Biology depart
ment, who has commented on
his sleep debt.
While at Stanford we are all
over-committed, nobody can re
ally question Teevens' exhaus
tion. After being hired on Jan. 9
as the new head coach of the
Cardinal, the previous assistant
head coach and offensive coor
dinator of the Florida Gators has
had a whirlwind first three
weeks, traveling all over the
country trying to attract recruits
and hire a coaching staff.
While the coaching staff has
yet to be finalized, Teevens can
carefully tick off his first task at
Stanford, as the Cardinal signed
16 recruits to National Letters of
Intent yesterday.
"Transition is difficult,"
Teevens said. "It was a little
tough to recruit a kid and have
him ask who his position coach
would be, and we hadn't hired
one. It was a bit of a catch-22. I
needed to be out on the road re
cruiting, but I also needed to
hire a staff so we could pick up
some of the top recruits."
After a careful assessment of
the 2006 recruiting class, few
would argue that Teevens
hasn't passed his first test. Not
only does the class showcase a
host of talented players, includ
ing eight Ail-Americans, it also
offers the Cardinal added depth

at positions that most urgently
needed to be filled.
"1 think we hit our need areas
quite effectively and that several
of these players will challenge
for playing time early in their ca
reers," said Teevens.
Highlighting this year's re
cruiting class is quarterback re
cruit Trent Edwards from near
by Los Gatos High School. Ed
wards was ranked among the
top quarterbacks in the nation
by every football publication, in
cluding as the top-rated passing
quarterback by USA Today.
"His accuracy is uncanny,"
said Teevens. "He throws a wide
variety of passes and reads de
fenses well. There is no question
that he is the complete package
at the quarterback position."
Complementing Edwards at
quarterback is David Lofton
from Piano, Texas. Another
solid passer, Lofton adds good
size and athleticism to the quar
terback position.
"He is a very talented guy,"
said Teevens. "He has a strong
arm and can step up and make
the play."
The recruiting class is also
heavily loaded in the offensive
line department. The signees
include David Beall from Van
couver, Wash.; Jon Cochran
from West Des Moines, Iowa;
Jeff Edwards from Atlanta, Ga;
Matt McClernan from Nor
cross, Ga; Ismail Simpson
from Lawton, Okla; andjosiah
Vinson from Irving, Texas,
