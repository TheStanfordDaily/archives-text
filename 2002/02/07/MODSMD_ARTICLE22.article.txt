This weekend, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
will hold court at the National
Team Indoor tournament in
Madison, Wis.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Today-Sunday: National
Team Indoor Championships
from Madison, Wis.

To play in the tournament is
an achievement for most
teams. But, as the two-time de
fending champions of the
tournament, the Cardinal
hopes to be the last of the 16
teams left standing.
Stanford is the top seed in the
tournament, and begins play
today .. 3:30 p.m. CST against
No ' 5 Visconsin (3-0), the host
sc' /ol, it r "" ,t day of the four
d y tournament.
Wisconsin is only 8-31 all

time at the tournament, but is
nonetheless regarded as a
tough opponent like all the
other schools at this presti
gious event.
The Badgers are coming off of
dual-match victories over
Brigham Young and Northern
Illinois and a 7-0 victory over
Minnesota in their Big Ten Con
ference opener.
Stanford is also undefeated
this year, having knocked off
Hawaii, 7-0, in November, and
defeating Pacific, 7-0, and No. 24
Pepperdine, 5-2, last weekend.
In fact, the Cardinal has won 33
straight team matches, including
last year's 30-win NCAA champi
onship season.
The status of the team's top
player, senior Lauren Kalvaria,
is uncertain. Ranked No. 4 na
tionally in singles and No. 1 in
doubles with senior Gabriela
Lastra, Kalvaria was unable to
play singles in last weekend's
competition due to a virus that

has affected her vision. She was
able, however, to play and win
handily two third-flight dou
bles matches with sophomore
Emilia Anderson.
Although the team's lineup
has been unusual of late, the Car
dinal's dominance has not come
into question.
"We've got a positive atti
tude," said senior Keiko Toku
da. "It's just adapting to cir
cumstances."
Stanford will have to be on
its game to outlast the rest of
the tournament's quality
teams. Seeded second
through eighth are Duke,
Vanderbilt, Georgia, Ten
nessee, Southern California,
Fresno State and Wake For
est, respectively. Those
schools will face Oklahoma
State, Northwestern, Baylor,
Old Dominion, Notre Dame,
North Carolina and Washing
ton, respectively, in other first
round matches.
The winner of Stanford-Wis
consin will play the winner of
Wake Forest-Washington, and
so forth, until the championship
match leaves only one undefeat
ed team.
Since the February weather in
Madison is snowy, the tourna
ment is played indoors. The Car

dinal got in a full day of practice
on the indoor courts yesterday,
and although it plays most of its
team matches outdoors, the play
ers are familiar with and know ex
actly what to expect from the in
door courts.
"Indoor courts are much faster,"
said sophomore Lizzy Bennett.
The Cardinal has been
looking forward to the tourna
ment and plans to relish prov
ing its mettle against the na
tion's best teams.
"We're very excited," Tokuda
said. "Madison's always a fun place."
