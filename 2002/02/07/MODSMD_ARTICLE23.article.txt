# Water polo looks for redemption
## After heartbreak end to 2001 season, women hope to win NCAA title in 2002 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
Last season, the women's water polo team strung
together a 26-game winning streak and was the first
collegiate team in the sport to go undefeated in the
regular season. It also won the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation for the second consecutive time
and was the most successful team in the Stanford pro
gram's six-year history.

And yet, it still walked away with the bitterness of
not accomplishing one particular feat: Winning a na
tional championship.
After going on its amazing 26-game winning
streak, Stanford lost its only match of the year in the
championship game to UCLA — a team that it had
previously defeated three times earlier in the season.
In a heartbreaker in front of its home crowd at the
Avery Aquatics Center, the Cardinal fell to the Bruins

by one goal in the final minute of the match.
"We can't spend our time focusing on what hap
pened in the past," said head coach John Tanner. "If
you have to use the past for motivation, then you're in
the sport for the wrong reason. Trying to erase a loss
is no way to get better. This is a new team and a new
season. We're starting from scratch."
The No. 2 Cardinal will still have its two Olympians
in sixth-year senior Ellen Estes and fourth-year
sophomore Brenda Villa, who both spent two years
out of the pool on the Farm to train for and play in the
2000 Olympics. However, it loses its strong seven-se
nior foundation of last year.
"We lost seven seniors who were not only all very
good players. They were very good leaders," Tan
ner said. "Not only will it be hard to replace their
talent and ability to play great team defense, but we
will also miss their work ethic and commitment to
the sport."
It was a combination of this stingy defense and dy
namic offense that led to the Cardinal's near perfec
tion last year. Numbers tell the story as the Cardinal
outseored opponents 302-104 on the season, averag
ing 11 goats per game and holding opponents to just
under four.
"This year we have a lot of really good offensive
players, so we should score a lot of goals," Tanner
said. "Since we lost three two-meter defenders, it
will be hard to rebuild our defen
sive unit. We have a great goalie
in Jackie [Frank] and a group of
very talented freshman who are
leaning the defense quickly."
Leading this offensive charge
will be senior Margie Dingeldein,
Villa and Estes.
The Cardinal will also be joined
this year by four freshmen: Cindy
Henn, Heather Stamper and twins
Hannah and Kelty Luber.
"We have a wealth of experi
ence on this team which is very
helpful for the younger players,"
Tanner said. "Ellen is a sixth year
senior and Kate Pettit, Ellen's co
captain, is a very diligent and
strong player. I think that this will
help the freshman to improve a lot
this year."
The Cardinal opens up its reg
ular season of play in the Stanford
Invitational Tournament, held
this weekend at the Avery Aquat
ics Center. The Cardinal won this
tournament last year, which gave
it a jumpstart on its 26-game win
ning streak.
