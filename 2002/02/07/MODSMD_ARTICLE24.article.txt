WRESTLING
Today: Stanford faces UC-Davis at
7 p.m., UC-Davis

With a win, the Cardinal (9-7, 2-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference) would ensure a win
ning record this season, even its confer
ence record and provide some payback
for last year's 20-9 Aggie victory.
A victory would also tie for the second
most in school history.

I he Cardinal won 15 meets in
1974-75 under coach Joe DeMeo. For
mer coach Chris Hot pel led Stanford
to 10 wins in 1982-83 and then again
in 1989-90.
UC-Davis (8-7, 3-2) last wrestled on
Jan. 26, falling to Oregon State 20-12.
While the Aggies did not compete at the
All-California Invitational last weekend,
wrestlers from both teams went head-to
head at the Aggie Open on Jan. 11.
As a result, Cardinal grapplers have
individual scores to settle this Friday
as well.
The Aggies' Urijah Faber won the
133-pound individual championship at
the Aggie Open while Stanford redshirt
freshman Brad Metzler earned a deci
sion over Aggie Cris Brines for third
place at 141 pounds.
After resting a knee injury last
week, Metzler is prepared fora re
match with Brines.
"We should have the ten guys we want
to wrestle in the Pac-lOs in the lineup this

week," said head coach Steve Buddie.
"Everyone who has been banged up
throughout the season is finally healthy
and should be ready to go."
Redshirt freshman Matt Gentry can
increase his team-leading victory total to
30 matches and also continue his streak
of consecutive wins, which currently
stands at 13.
Sophomore Nathan Peterson will
look to continue his successful season in
his third match since returning from a
finger injury.
Peterson, who finished 9-20 last sea
son, is currently 18-6 and will square of!
against Davis sophomore Tommy
Schurkamp at 125 pounds. Schurkamp
is riding a three-match win streak.
In what will likely be one of the closest
bouts of the meet, Stanford senior Levi
YVeikel-Magden looks to exact revenge
fora narrow 15-12 final round loss at the
Aggie Open to Davis' Jeremiah Jarvis at

The Stanford wrestling team hopes to avenge a 26-9 loss to the UC-Davis Aggies when it meets
them tonight on the UC-Davis campus at 7 p.m.
157 pounds.
A win over Jarvis would likely
secure at least a No. 3 seed for
Weikel-Magden at the Pac-10
Championships to be held March
2-3 in Corvallis, Ore.
"This is a great test for us,"
Buddie said. "It's going to be a
fantastic match to watch because
many of the bouts are going to be
very close. In the matches that we
are favored to win, we need to win
them big to help the team score."
