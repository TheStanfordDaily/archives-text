# Swimming looks to down the Trojans
## 
### KENNETH GARRETT 
Old rivalries are sometimes the greatest in
spiration, and the smell of victory is in the air as
the top-ranked Stanford men's swimming team
(6-0, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference) looks to de
stroy No. 8 Southern California (4-3,0-2) in Los
Angeles this Saturday.

But the Trojans won't make it easy.
USC is traditionally strong in the middle and
distance freestyle events, while Stanford excels
in sprints, stroke events and relays.
"Even though they're not as deep as we are,
they can still put up a good fight in a dual
meet," said senior tri-captain Michael O'Neil.
"Nobody is overlooking USC as an oppo
nent," agreed sophomore Nick Bott.
Olympic medalist Erik Vendt of USC will
challenge Cardinal sophomore Matt Sorlien

to an epic battle in the 1000-yard freestyle.
One of the best distance swimmers the nation
has ever seen, Vendt narrowly edged out
Sorlien last year, and the Cardinal is looking
for revenge.
"If Matt goes out there and is patient, he can
beat [Vendt]," O'Neil said.
Another race to watch will be the 200 Indi
vidual Medley, which will pit Trojan Tamas
Kerekjarto against Stanford sophomore
Markus Rogan. Kerekjarto is very fast in-sea
son, but Rogan's competitiveness may carry
him through.
"Whatever Kerekjarto goes, Markus is going
to go a little faster," said O'Neil.
The Cardinal begins the weekend ahead
in the overall point tally because of a re
sounding win last weekend by the divers,
who clinched first and second in both events.
The Cardinal will also gain a psychological
advantage by watching the Trojans face No.
4 Cal tomorrow.
"It gives us a chance to see what we're going
to be up against. It'll motivate us to get in and

do better than both of those teams," said fresh
man Matt McDonald.
As the Cardinal nears the Pac-10 and NCAA
meets, they are focusing on the little tilings that
can make a big difference in a race, like turns
and starts.
" The whole mentality of the season changes
around this point," McDonald said. "It's really
the time of year we want to show the country
what we're made of."
More than points are at stake in this meet;
the Bell Trophy is awarded annually to the win
ner of the Stanford / USC dual meet. Though
not as storied as football's famous Axe, the Car
dinal would hate to lose the trophy it has held
the last four years.
"This may be the fastest dual meet in history
this weekend, in terms of the number of nation
leading times set," O'Neil said.
Added senior tri-captain Peter Lennox-
King: "Last time we swam at USC, the fans
booed us during the introductions. So we're
looking forward to going into a hostile environ
ment and showing them what's up."
