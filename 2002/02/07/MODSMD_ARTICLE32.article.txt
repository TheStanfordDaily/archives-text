More surprising than Stanford in fifth
place...
Most surprising of all. . .Oregon sits
atop the Pac-10 in first place as the cause
of all this madness.
In a conference so 'pac'ed' full of his
torically dominant teams — like No. 11
Arizona, No. 15 UCLA and No. 20 Stan
ford — and a team that shocked the world
last season with its remarkable trip to the
Elite Eight in No. 25 Southern California,
there was no room in preseason predic
tions for even the thought of Oregon.
However, there Oregon sits, at the top
of the Pac-10 with a one game lead over
USC and Arizona, a two-game lead over
UCLA and a two-and-a-half game lead
over both Stanford and California.
"[Oregon's] in first place, right?" said
sophomore shooting guard Matt Lottich.
"A win over them would really put us back
in the hunt fora Pac-10 championship
and that's a goal that we've had since the
beginning of the year, to win the Pac-10
championship. So right now it's pretty
much a must-win if we want to accomplish
our goal."

The Cardinal's room for error is getting
smaller and smaller as the weeks progress.
Stanford can't afford to lose anymore
games due to a lack of intensity. Physical fa
tigue can no longer be an excuse. Youth
fulness is not a possible alibi anymore.
"The game [against Oregon] is impor
tant because it is the next game," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery.
"You have to continue to go back and play
hard for every game. A lot of teams are
still in the running for things and you
have to win your games at home because
it is so tough to win on the road."
When you look at Stanford's schedule
ahead, there is no time to take any
breathers.
Life isn't getting any easier as the sea
son progresses, with UCLA and USC
coming to Maples Pavilion and a trip
down to sunny Arizona to close out the
regular season.
Oregon has things a little easier. The
Ducks have already played and beaten
Arizona twice this season.
However, four of Oregon's final seven
games will be played on the road versus
the Bay Area and Los Angeles schools.
Like the Cardinal, its season is far from
over as well.
"Everyone still feels that we have a
chance to win," said freshman point
guard Chris Hernandez. "We basically
have to come out and win the rest of our
games and that means beating a lot of
teams that have already beaten us.
"It's definitely better playing at home
but as we've shown, we've lost both at
home and on the road, so nothing's
guaranteed anymore. We just need to
get it done basically. It doesn't matter
where we are."

Well, maybe it matters a little. Oregon
has not lost a Pac-10 game at home yet
this season. Luckily the Cardinal gets a
chance to face the Ducks at Maples this
time, removed from the intensity and the
intimidation that The Pit at McArthur
Court engenders.
But the Ducks have shown their weak
nesses as well. Oregon's only two Pac-10
losses came against lower-division Arizona
State and Washington, proving that it too,
is vulnerable to the occasional upset.
"[Oregon is] very good at home and
[it shoots] the ball well," Montgomery
said. "Hopefully they are not as good on
the road. I am sure they will still play
hard, but hopefully not as confidently.
They are playing together well right
now and are a huge threat to win the
Pac-10."
Oh yeah, on a side note, the Cardinal
will face Oregon State on Saturday. And
the Beavers ain't that bad, either.
Oregon State is holding on by its teeth
one game ahead of Washington, hoping to
clinch a berth into the Pac-10 Tournament.
Only the league's top eight teams will qual
ify for the tournament, which will be held at
the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
"I think that both games are going to
be tough games," said sophomore Justin
Davis. "We're at the point where we can't
take any team for granted. Both are going
to come in hungry."
If the Cardinal has learned anything
from Saturday's devastating loss to Ari
zona, it is that playing for an entire 40
minutes is imperative.
"It was a tough loss, but we played
hard," said Montgomery. "The team gets
over it quicker than the coach does."
