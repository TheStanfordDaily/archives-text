# Tony Giovacchini:
## Keeping an eye on the ball 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For Tony Giovacchini, the year
began with so much promise.
The 2001-02 season was a jour
ney the senior point guard would
control — a journey he had waited
three years to grasp, to clutch, to
call his own.
In some respects, nothing has
changed. Giovacchini is still the
starting point guard, the guy who
runs the club. lie's also still vocal in
team huddles, and he implores his
teammates to play with intensity
day-in and day-out.
In other respects, though, Gio
vacchini's role is not the same. His
minutes are down. The number
of skeptics is growing. His pres
ence in critical moments of games
is declining.
But why? He has certainly done
everything asked of him, and the
Cardinal has been successful when
he has been on the court.
Six times in non-conference
play, Giovacchini played 25 or
more minutes. Stanford's record?
5-1. In fact, the only loss was an
overtime defeat to Texas in which
the 6-foot-2, 180-pound senior
spent the entire extra session on
the bench.
Slowly, those minutes have de
dined. He played only 17 at Ore
gon, 15 against Washington State,
16 at UCLA and 16 against Arizona.
The Cardinal's record? Just 2-2.
So why not Giovacchini? He's
certainly got the right attitude.
"I always want to have the op
portunity to help our team on the
floor," he said. "There are a lot of
things that don't involve putting the
ball in the basket or making a flashy
play that really do help the team."
Like consistent defense. Or po
sition rebounding. Or a 2-to-l as
sist-to-tumover ratio. Or helping
his teammates even if he's not in
the game.
"It has to be tough for him, but
in the huddles at the end of the
game, if he's still on the bench, he
comes in and gives advice. If he
sees something, he lets it be
known," said forward Justin Davis.
Giovacchini just might be a vie

tim of bad timing. If last year's
team was here (excluding
Michael McDonald), one that had
four dependable scoring threats
on the court at all times, he would
probably be averaging 30 min
utes per night.
This year, however, a lack of of
fensive production from other posi
tions has throttled his playing time.
"We're not getting a lot of points
at the [power forward] right now,
so you've got to get scoring from all
spots on the floor. Tony's not nec
essarily been a scorer," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said.
With four perimeter players in
Casey Jacobsen, Julius Barnes,
Josh Childress and Giovacchini,
the Salt Lake City native has often
been the odd man out, particularly
against up-tempo teams.
Yet, throughout it all — the criti
cisms and disappointments, defeats
and deterrents — Giovacchini's con
fident demeanor has never wavered
and his objectives are still the same.
"My personal goal is the same as
our team's: To be as good as we can
possibly be," Giovacchini said. "I
also need to understand that we
have a lot of gtiys on our roster that
have a lot of talent. 1 have to sup
port that."
Frankly, from day one, Giovac
chini has understood that he would
be the player that kept everyone on
task and focused.
As the team left for its season
opener in New Mexico, while his
teammates bustled with excitement
and energy, Giovacchini sat by
himself, silently focused.
This trip, like all other road trips
this season, would be business
only. No indulgence. Or amuse
ment. Just business.
Safe to say, Giovacchini simply
took care of business by tallying a
season-high 13 points at The Pit,
including a 3-for-3 showing from
behind the arc, and led the Cardi
nal to an 81-66 victory. It made a
statement to Cardinal fans that
the loss of McDonald would not
be a problem.
He then matched a career-high
with eight assists in Stanford's next
game against Southern Utah.
But all of a sudden, as freshman

Chris Hernandez showed signs of
growth and junior Julius Barnes
displayed his athleticism, energy
and scoring ability, Giovaochini's
minutes have begun to wane.
So while Hernandez and
Barnes have received the nod dur
ing the last five minutes in crucial
games at Oregon and against the
Arizona schools, Giovacchini has
sat on the bench, wondering if he'll

ever get the opportunity to lead his
team again.
" I fall t liese guys and go out and
play hard, I can cope with the fact
that I'm not going to play 40 min
utes a game," Giovacchini said.
But what about 30 minutes? Or
even 25? What about playing him
down the stretch? *

As the only senior contributor to the men's basketball team, point guard Tony
Giovacchini has lent a steadying influence to the inconsistent Cardinal.
One can say he's earned it.
"Tony's important to us and
it's important for me to keep him
playing so he recognizes that
he's important," Montgomery
said. "Of all the players, he prob
ably knows best what it is we're
trying to do."
Of course he does. He's the
fourth-year senior. He's the force.
And he's the glue.
Therefore, the season still
holds much promise for Giovac
chini. If only someone would give
him a chance.
Just take a look at any basket
ball media guide or poster,
which bears his surname, jersey
and profile.

still his team.

16 at UCLA and 16 against Arizona.
The Cardinal's record? Just 2-2.
So why not Giovacchini? He's
certainly got the right attitude.
"I always want to have the op
portunity to help our team on the
floor," he said. "There are a lot of
things that don't involve putting the
ball in the basket or making a flashy
play that really do help the team."
Like consistent defense. Or po
sition rebounding. Or a 2-to-l as
sist-to-tumover ratio. Or helping
his teammates even if he's not in
the game.
"It has to be tough for him, but
in the huddles at the end of the
game, if he's still on the bench, he
comes in and gives advice. If he
sees something, he lets it be
known," said forward Justin Davis.
Giovacchini just might be a vie

tim of bad timing. If last year's
team was here (excluding
Michael McDonald), one that had
four dependable scoring threats
on the court at all times, he would
probably be averaging 30 min
utes per night.
This year, however, a lack of of
fensive production from other posi
tions has throttled his playing time.
"We're not getting a lot of points
at the [power forward] right now,
so you've got to get scoring from all
spots on the floor. Tony's not nec
essarily been a scorer," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said.
With four perimeter players in
Casey Jacobsen, Julius Barnes,
Josh Childress and Giovacchini,
the Salt Lake City native has often
been the odd man out, particularly
against up-tempo teams.
Yet, throughout it all — the criti
cisms and disappointments, defeats
and deterrents — Giovacchini's con
fident demeanor has never wavered
and his objectives are still the same.
"My personal goal is the same as
our team's: To be as good as we can
possibly be," Giovacchini said. "I
also need to understand that we
have a lot of gtiys on our roster that
have a lot of talent. 1 have to sup
port that."
Frankly, from day one, Giovac
chini has understood that he would
be the player that kept everyone on
task and focused.
As the team left for its season
opener in New Mexico, while his
teammates bustled with excitement
and energy, Giovacchini sat by
himself, silently focused.
This trip, like all other road trips
this season, would be business
only. No indulgence. Or amuse
ment. Just business.
Safe to say, Giovacchini simply
took care of business by tallying a
season-high 13 points at The Pit,
including a 3-for-3 showing from
behind the arc, and led the Cardi
nal to an 81-66 victory. It made a
statement to Cardinal fans that
the loss of McDonald would not
be a problem.
He then matched a career-high
with eight assists in Stanford's next
game against Southern Utah.
But all of a sudden, as freshman

Chris Hernandez showed signs of
growth and junior Julius Barnes
displayed his athleticism, energy
and scoring ability, Giovaochini's
minutes have begun to wane.
So while Hernandez and
Barnes have received the nod dur
ing the last five minutes in crucial
games at Oregon and against the
Arizona schools, Giovacchini has
sat on the bench, wondering if he'll

ever get the opportunity to lead his
team again.
" I fall t liese guys and go out and
play hard, I can cope with the fact
that I'm not going to play 40 min
utes a game," Giovacchini said.
But what about 30 minutes? Or
even 25? What about playing him
down the stretch? *

As the only senior contributor to the men's basketball team, point guard Tony
Giovacchini has lent a steadying influence to the inconsistent Cardinal.
One can say he's earned it.
"Tony's important to us and
it's important for me to keep him
playing so he recognizes that
he's important," Montgomery
said. "Of all the players, he prob
ably knows best what it is we're
trying to do."
Of course he does. He's the
fourth-year senior. He's the force.
And he's the glue.
Therefore, the season still
holds much promise for Giovac
chini. If only someone would give
him a chance.
Just take a look at any basket
ball media guide or poster,
which bears his surname, jersey
and profile.
The answer is simple: This is
still his team.
And this is still his time.
For Tony Giovacchini, the year
began with so much promise.
The 2001-02 season was a jour
ney the senior point guard would
control — a journey he had waited
three years to grasp, to clutch, to
call his own.
In some respects, nothing has
changed. Giovacchini is still the
starting point guard, the guy who
runs the club. lie's also still vocal in
team huddles, and he implores his
teammates to play with intensity
day-in and day-out.
In other respects, though, Gio
vacchini's role is not the same. His
minutes are down. The number
of skeptics is growing. His pres
ence in critical moments of games
is declining.
But why? He has certainly done
everything asked of him, and the
Cardinal has been successful when
he has been on the court.
Six times in non-conference
play, Giovacchini played 25 or
more minutes. Stanford's record?
5-1. In fact, the only loss was an
overtime defeat to Texas in which
the 6-foot-2, 180-pound senior
spent the entire extra session on
the bench.
Slowly, those minutes have de
dined. He played only 17 at Ore
gon, 15 against Washington State,
16 at UCLA and 16 against Arizona.
The Cardinal's record? Just 2-2.
So why not Giovacchini? He's
certainly got the right attitude.
