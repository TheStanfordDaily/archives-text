# No. 2 women look to clinch at Oregon
## Sweep of Ducks, Beavers will give Cardinal Pac-10 title 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last year things were a bit dif
ferent for the Cardinal when it
made the trip to the Beaver State.
Entering the road trip, the
Cardinal was sitting at 7-5 and 1-
2 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
after opening Pac-10 play with a
conference split of the Arizona
schools.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Today: No. 2 Stanford at
Oregon, 7:00 p.m., McArthur
Court, Eugene, Ore.
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford at
Oregon State, 2:00 p.m., Gill
Coliseum, Corvallis, Ore.

With Susan King and Jamie
Carey sidelined with injuries and
a green freshman, Nicole Powell,
assuming the point guard posi
tion, the questions became
whether the Cardinal could sur
vive conference play without a
true guard or a player under six
foot on its roster.
And while the questions were
scary, the results were even scari
er. The Cardinal suffered its first
two-loss conference road trip in
over a decade, placing it at a mis
erable 1-3 in conference play.
But who said memories were
important?
This time around the Cardinal
(21-1, 12-0 Pac-10), is riding
high, moving up in the rankings
this week to No. 2, its highest
ranking since 1996-1997, after a
Tennessee loss to Vanderbilt.
The team is currently a whop
ping three-and-one-half games
ahead of second place Arizona
State and could clinch a share of
the Pac-10 title this weekend with
a pair of wins — even with seven
conference games left to play.
However, while things appear
to be full speed ahead for Stan
ford, the Oregon road trip still
comes with its host of challenges,

and the Cardinal is hardly resting
on its laurels.
Between Oregon and Oregon
State, Stanford will meet ar
guably the best two guards in the
conference, getting a hint of the
quickness and court vision they
will have to contend with if they
hope to meet some of the nation's
premiere teams in the NCAA
tournament.
For the Ducks, junior
Shaquala Williams leads the
charge. The 1999-2000 Pac-10
Player of the Year, Williams was
out last season with a tear of her
anterior cruciate ligament.
This season she has returned
to top shape, and her blistering
penetration and ability to create
her own shot make her one of the
top threats in the league.
The Beavers also have a confer
ence player of the year on their
roster in senior Felicia Ragland.
Another strong, athletic guard,
Ragland is a threat from any
where on the court, and has the
ability to drive inside or pull up on
the perimeter.
However, tough guards won't
be the Cardinal's only focus when
they travel up North — it will also
be their only opportunity to play at
notorious McArthur Court before
the Pac-10 tournament, the first
weekend in March.
Known to Duck fans affection
ately as "The Pit," McArthur
Court is arguably the hardest
place to play in the conference,
and the Cardinal knows this bet
ter than any.
The team hasn't won in Eu
gene in the past three seasons,
meaning that there isn't a player
on the current roster that has
recorded a road win over the
Ducks.
While Stanford looks like it is in
pretty good shape to claim the reg
ular season conference title, it still
must get through three games in
the Pac-10 tournament to be de
clared outright champs. And to
win these games they must do it at
The Pit.
But while it's never good to be
overconfident, history most likely
will not repeat itself this weekend.
After all, the Cardinal isn't the No.
2 team in the nation for nothing.
