# INS to monitor students
## Bechtel examines new government system to track foreign students 
### NAEL FAKHRY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following the attacks of Sept. 11,
American immigration officials an
nounced plans to rapidly build and
implement a nationwide system for
tracking foreign students studying
in the United States.
According to John Pearson, di
rector of the Bechtel International
Center, immigration officials will
more closely monitor and track for
eign students under the new sys
tem. They will require universities
to confirm the arrival of students,
receipt of diplomas and any change
of degree.
"1988 was the last time since the
[Immigration and Naturalization
Service] has asked schools for this
sort of comprehensive data on its
foreign students," Pearson said.
He explained that the INS's lack

of resources in sorting through all
tiie information — as well as inaccu
rate data — prompted immigration
officials to stop the collection of doc
uments in 1988.
"[Since then], Stanford has pro
vided information on foreign stu
dents only upon request, and these
requests have been few and far be
tween," Pearson said.
"They have a perfect right by law
to request information and come
and talk about students, and Bech
tel has to provide information on
these students. But this only hap
pened once in the last three years ..
. it's very, very infrequent."
Pearson emphasized that the in
formation Stanford has released to
officials has only ensured that "stu
dents are here doing what they're
supposed to be doing... we have
data on foreign students just like we
have data for all students."
He stressed that the INS has had
the right to request information lim
ited to immigration issues alone,
while any matters of personal signif
icance have been off-limits. Officials
have also been prevented from re

questing information on the daily
behavior of foreign students.
Under the new tracking guide
lines, these restrictions will all re
main intact. However, Stanford will
revisit the practice of regularly pro
viding information on foreign stu
dents, and will do so through a data
base designed by the federal gov
ernment in order to streamline the
process. This will prevent a repeat of
the backlog that occurred in 1988.
Pearson voiced concern that the
University's knowledge of the new
system remains, in his words, "real
ly limited." He expressed hope that
before January 0f2003 — when the
system becomes operational — the
University will have more informa
tion about it.
"We aren't even familiar with the
software yet or a lot of the specifics,"
Pearson said.
Pearson was hopeful despite
these worries.
"What the Senate has proposed
is something we can live
with ... but we don't yet have it in
law so we're still waiting for more
details," he said.
In the meantime, the INS plans
to launch an interim system
whereby immigration officials at
ports of entry, including airports
and border crossings, will imme
diately inform the State Depart
ment of students' entry and exit to
ensure they do not overstay their
visa limits and that they actually
attend school.
"As long as the information we
provide is to guarantee students
have come to the U.S. to [study],
we find the rules acceptable,"
Pearson said.
He cautioned against some lan
guage in the proposal which
seemed to award too much power
to the government.
His reservations stem from pos
sible special investigations of stu
dents from countries on the State
Department's list which the U.S.
claims support terrorism.
"Officials may become excessive
in their zeal. . . and try to encour
age these students not to come
study at Stanford," Pearson said.
In spite of the heightened alert

ness by immigration officials, Pear
son said that Stanford's foreign
students have had almost no prob
lems entering the country.
"There has been no trend of
students being uncomfortable
being in the U.S. or at Stanford,"
Pearson said.
Still, concerns have been
raised on campus by groups like
the Muslim Students Awareness
Network, which led a teach-in
Nov. 26 to voice apprehension
about a possible loss of freedom
and profiling of students from
Middle Eastern countries.
Senior Irem Saleem, MSAN
president, said that Bechtel has
been very cooperative.
Freshman Anthony Hui, a for
eign student from Hong Kong,
said he has not experienced any
trouble dealing with the Universi
ty or immigration officials.
"So far, I don't feel anything
new," Hui said. "I only hope that
this remains the case for other for
eign students."
"The big test will be this com
ing fall when we see if foreign
students continue to study here
or turn away from the U.S. out of
fear of immigration trouble and
concerns about [the govern
ment] monitoring students,"
Pearson said.
