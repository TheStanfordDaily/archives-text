# Kelley Suminski and Sebnem Kimyacioglu:
## Getting to the point: the future is now 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Freshman year is all about adjustment.
Adjusting to living away from home and meeting
new people.
Adjusting to living in a dorm and walking to class.
For freshmen Kelley Suminski and Sebnem
Kimyacioglu, adjustment also refers to new team
mates, new coaches and a new level of competition.
"Everyone is a lot quicker and stronger than the
players in high school," Suminski said. "Everyone is
also a lot more competitive because, in high school,
girls are just playing because they have nothing bet
ter to do. But here, they want to be here and they are
trying to improve. Everyone is trying to get better
every day to compete against each other."
Suminski has also had to deal with the adjustment
to a new position, shifting from her previous shoot
ing guard role to the team's starting point guard.
"Susan King and Jamie Carey have helped out a
lot, especially in preseason," Suminski said. " They
taught me certain things about handling the ball and
how to run the offense. The coaches have also been
really helpful, but I like playing the point. It is some
thing new, but it's fun."
In high school in New Jersey, Suminski was dom
inant, averaging 20.1 points per game her senior
season on 60 percent shooting from the floor. She
finished the season as the Gatorade New Jersey State
Player of the Year and was named to her third
straight All-New Jersey first team.
Since joining the No. 2 Cardinal, Suminski has
had to slightly alter her style of play.
"I'm not trying to change my game," Suminski
said. "Obviously, it has to change a bit when you
change positions, but I am just trying to learn differ
ent skills and improve on being a point guard."
This season, Suminski has been averaging 8.8
points and 2.7 assists per game, while starting 16
games at the point this season. Sophomore Susan
King was expected to play as the starting point guard
at the beginning of the season, but was at first slowed
with injuries. King is now out for the season after
stretching her anterior cruciate ligament, leaving the
team in Suminski's control.
"It was disappointing to lose Susan — she
helped the team but a lot," Suminski said. "But you
can't just quit. She is a great player, and she still

helps me out. But she helps from the sidelines, she
can't help on the court."
While Suminski has developed into a point
guard, Kimyacioglu has been finding her stroke late
ly. Coming off the bench, she has been on target
since the team returned from a late-season trip to the
East Coast.

Earlier in the season, Kimyacioglu played pri
marily at the point, splitting time with Suminski. As
the season has progressed, however, Kimyacioglu
has developed into more of a shooting guard, giving
the Cardinal added firepower form the perimeter.
"1 was a guard in high school," Kimyacioglu said.
"I am more comfortable at the two, but it's definitely

fun to call the shots at the point."
Kimyacioglu has been on fire from behind the
ark, shooting 57.5 percent in conference play. She
scored 22 points in the two-game series against Cali
fornia and is looking more comfortable on the court
every game.
"The coaches and my teammates have been real
ly supportive," Kimyacioglu said. "They have
shown confidence in me and that makes me more
comfortable in me. That makes me more comfort
able on the floor."
Kimyacioglu and Suminski's adjustments have
been made easier by the talent of the deep Cardi
nal squad.
"They are all great passers," Kimyacioglu said.
"They make it easy for me. Everyone is focusing on
Nicole [Powell] and Lindsey [Yamasaki], so when I
get a shot, it's usually wide open."
While Powell and Yamasaki create shots for their
teammates on the floor, they also help the develop
ment of the freshmen's game in practice.
"It always helps to play against great players —
they make you better in practice every day," Sumin
ski said. "They push you and it's such a challenge to
play against them. It's a challenge to guard everyone
on our team, so it makes you better."
With only six more conference games remaining,
the Cardinal is entering the final stretch on its quest
for the national championship.
"I am so excited," Kimyacioglu said. "Everyone
sees the potential and where we can go. It is going to
be great playing different teams. Hopefully we are
going to keep improving until then, because we still
have a month. We are just going to be at our prime,
and it's going to be a great experience, because we are
going to be playing with the top teams in the nation."
For the Cardinal to succeed in March, it will need
strong play out of its two freshman guards. But after
23 games, it's hard to tell that Kimyacioglu and Sum
inski are playing their first year of college ball.
"The whole team has helped out the freshmen,"
Suminski said. "I don't think we are treated as fresh
man — en the court everyone is pretty much the
same. They have done a great job to help us feel wel
come and fit on the team."
That is bad news for Stanford's opponents.
Now that Kimyacioglu and Suminski are done
adjusting, they can continue doing what they do
best: dominating.
