# Financial aid remains competitive
## Stanford parents have less trouble paying tuition bills than families nationwide 
### WAYNN LUE 
As the economy continues its down
ward spiral, more and more people are
struggling to make ends meet. Nation
wide, colleges are receiving more re
quests from parents to postpone hills as
they try to secure alternative forms of
payments, such as loans from the gov
ernment or private sources.
But at Stanford parents seem to be less
worried about tuition, which totals over
$30,000 annually. According to a survey
conducted by the University, the finan
cial stress felt by parents of Stanford ju
niors and seniors has decreased from
1997 to 2001.
"We've made improvements over the
past five years to help families afford a
Stanford education," said Rana Glasgal,
director of institutional research, and
head of the study co-sponsored by the
Office of Admissions and Financial Aid
and the Budget Office.

Robin Mamlet, dean of admission
and financial aid, also commented on
Stanford's situation in comparison
with other Universities.
"Our commitment to financial aid
and access has never been greater,"
Mamlet said. "The University has invest
ed a great deal in improvements to fi
nancial aid over the last several years, re
ducing the amount of self-help that stu
dents are asked to assume and making it
more possible to respond to the needs of
middle-income families."
Changes made to the financial aid
system over the past five years includ
ed setting a cap on the value of home
equity at three times annual income
and capping parental income counted
toward the ability to pay tuition.
These changes have helped reduce
the amount that parents have been
obligated to pay fora students' educa
tion at Stanford.
"Our packaging for lower-income
families has continued to be a major
commitment, and all our students have
their demonstrated need met through
our very competitive financial aid pro
gram," Mamlet said.
The Stanford survey was included in a

study conducted by the Consortium on
Financing Higher Education, a collection
of East Coast schools including a number
of Ivy League members. Their results will
be posted later in the spring.
"All of our peers are in that group, so
we're going to have some really valuable
data when they release their results,"
Glasgal said.
With the exception of Princeton,
which eliminated loans completely from
its financial aid package, colleges usually
place some of the burden on parents and
some on students, covering the rest with
grants and loans.
"Our package is similar to other elite
schools, like M.I.T. and Harvard," Glas
gal said. "We offer equally competitive
self-help levels."
Mamlet agreed, citing the need to pro
vide an education to all students regard
less of financial need.
"As our costs rise and the economy
takes a downturn, it is more important
than ever that [we] communicate the mes
sage to talented young people across the
country that ability to pay is not a factor in
Stanford's admission decisions, and that
we will make it possible for all our admit
ted students to enroll here," she said.
