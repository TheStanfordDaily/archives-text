# Inconsistencies exist within grading system
## Students question grading by teaching assistants and fellows in some courses 
### ALLA GONOPOLSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Have you ever slaved away on a paper
and gotten a "B" while a friend who un
doubtedly did not work as hard received
an "A?"
If the answer is "yes," then you are not
alone. In addition to rumors of grade in
flation, Stanford professors and teaching
assistants must also tackle the problem of
overall grading inconsistencies for stu
dent work. Classes with certain instructors
quickly acquire reputations of being
"hard" or "easy" due to a professors' grad
ing system, and some students plan their
schedules accordingly.
"After I switched [teaching fellows] in
my [Introduction to Humanities] course,

my grade improved significantly," sopho
more Uchenna Okoye said.
Is this just a coincidence or the result of
inconsistent grading among teaching fel
lows and assistants?
Cherri Ross, associate director of the
IHUM program, assured students that
teaching fellows undergo extensive train
ing that highlights the importance of
grade norming and the special needs of
college freshmen.
"We always try to look for discrepan
cies among the IHUM courses, but there
are disciplinary differences in each
course that make it difficult to ensure
total consistency throughout the pro
gram," Ross said.
Even though many freshmen feel that
IHUM grades are sometimes unfair, their
TPs make sure to emphasize the way stu
dents are evaluated with the help of a
handout. The handout describes in detail
what distinguishes "A" papers from "B"-
and "C"-level work. «
The supposed grading inconsis
tencies do not bother freshman
Antonio lannarone.
"Every grader will have a slight
ly different view on the quality of
the work he or she is grading, but I
feel like it all evens out in the end,"
lannarone said.
While IHUM TFs all have doc
toral degrees and extensive teach
ing experience, TAs for other class
es are usually graduate students se
lected by the department. Since
they usually do not have a plethora
of training or experience in com
parison to the professor for the
course, students like sophomore
Diana Agraz feel uneasy about
being evaluated by them.
"I feel like my grade is wholly at
the mercy of whatever TA I get,"
Agraz said.
Many TAs have previously
taken the course they are assisting
in and the department's graduate
class in teaching methods. Still,
some students remain skeptical of
their TAs' qualifications.
"Things seem more fair in
techie classes, but in the fuzzy ( lass
es, anything goes," junior Pete
Grossman said.
This year's University Grading
System clearly states that "instruc
tors are discouraged from award
ing grades according to any prede
termined distribution system."
This policy gives instructors
complete discretion over students'
grades, allowing professors and
TAs to run the class in the way they
see fit. In general, this discretion

tends to widen the grading incon
sistency, due to the subjective na
ture of grading. Depending on
how a particular educator feels
about the grading system, a class
might enjoy a substantial curve or
none at all.
While some professors and
TAs seem to give students the
benefit of the doubt and succumb
to the pressure to inflate grades,
others strictly stand their ground
and adhere to more rigid grad
ing standards.
Communications TA Cherian
George told his "Communication
104: Writing and Reporting the
News" class that he is not a fan of
grade inflation.
"Only the few who really de
serve it should get an 'A,'" George
said. "Otherwise, it demeans the
work that they have put in."
IHUM Director Rob Robin
son said in an interview,"ln
many ways, one has to be sorry
that grades, and the pressure
leading to grade inflation, exist
at all. Ideally, students should be
in a class because they want to
learn from professors who want
to teach them subjects they are
passionate about."
1 le added, "Of course, this isn't
an ideal world."
Although a broad spectrum of
opinions can be expected at a uni
versity as large and diverse as Stan
ford, the inability of instructors to
agree on a consistent valuation of
work and standard of grading con
tinues to trouble students who
stress over their GPA.
"I definitely acknowledge that
grade inflation exists prominently
at Stanford, and — on one hand
— it makes sense, because if you're
going to a school whose academic

program is more challenging than
others, you should be rewarded in
some way," sophomore Geoff Mor
ris said. "But, at the same time, it
alsoiblurs the distinction between
students at Stanford and devalues
good work."
For Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose, examinations
and grading are the least fulfilling
aspects of his job.
"If we are to have grades," he
§aid, "then it seems to me that they
should be used to reward the best
work. So "hard" or "easy" grading
are not concepts that I have much
time for. I prefer the term 'fair.'"
Dallas Denery, a TF for the
I HUM course titled, "Democratic
Society," also made a distinction
between these terms.
"There is a difference between
grading 'hard' and grading 'un
fairly,' " Denery said. "If a student
thinks his work was graded unfair
ly, in the sense that other people in
the section received higher grades
for the same quality work, I will re
view it with him to see if he is cor
rect or not.
"Ifa student thinks they would
have received a higher grade had
another instructor graded their
work, I am less concerned.
There will always be some varia
tions in how people grade. Peo
ple are different."
Students who feel that their TA
has evaluated them unfairly can
turn to pages 46 and 47 of the Stan
ford Bulletin, which outline the
University's policy on student aca
demic grievance procedures.
University Registrar Roger
Printup explained that the process
is to be used by individual students
who have a complaint against a
faculty member or one of the other

groups mentioned in the policy.
As the procedure states, griev
ances "do not pertain to com
plaints expressing dissatisfaction
with a University policy chal
lenged on the grounds that the
policy is unfair or inadvisable."
Before a student files a griev
ance, he or she must first make
informal attempts at resolution
by discussing the problem with
the TA, professor, or depart
ment head.
"I'm always happy to re-read
and — if necessary — re-grade as
signments that students feel were
unfairly assessed," Breitrose said.
It should come as no surprise
that grading practices vary
across disciplines.
"Students will perceive that
some courses or departments con
sistently have patterns of higher
or lower grades than some norm,"
Printup said. He also said that this
issue has been reviewed by the
Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, on
which there is student representa
tion, and that discussions have
taken place between the commit
tee and the departments about
the philosophies of grading exist
ing at Stanford.
Since grade inflation and incon
sistency are not easily resolvable is
sues, for now students will have to
find comfort in knowing that edu
cators and administrators are
aware of the problem and express
eagerness to address it.
Ross acknowledged the
paradox that exists in the acad
emic world.
" The culture of academia is one
of tremendous independence, but
at the same time is a common effort
toward a common goal."

lannarone said.
While IHUM TFs all have doc
toral degrees and extensive teach
ing experience, TAs for other class
es are usually graduate students se
lected by the department. Since
they usually do not have a plethora
of training or experience in com
parison to the professor for the
course, students like sophomore
Diana Agraz feel uneasy about
being evaluated by them.
"I feel like my grade is wholly at
the mercy of whatever TA I get,"
Agraz said.
Many TAs have previously
taken the course they are assisting
in and the department's graduate
class in teaching methods. Still,
some students remain skeptical of
their TAs' qualifications.
"Things seem more fair in
techie classes, but in the fuzzy ( lass
es, anything goes," junior Pete
Grossman said.
This year's University Grading
System clearly states that "instruc
tors are discouraged from award
ing grades according to any prede
termined distribution system."
This policy gives instructors
complete discretion over students'
grades, allowing professors and
TAs to run the class in the way they
see fit. In general, this discretion

tends to widen the grading incon
sistency, due to the subjective na
ture of grading. Depending on
how a particular educator feels
about the grading system, a class
might enjoy a substantial curve or
none at all.
While some professors and
TAs seem to give students the
benefit of the doubt and succumb
to the pressure to inflate grades,
others strictly stand their ground
and adhere to more rigid grad
ing standards.
Communications TA Cherian
George told his "Communication
104: Writing and Reporting the
News" class that he is not a fan of
grade inflation.
"Only the few who really de
serve it should get an 'A,'" George
said. "Otherwise, it demeans the
work that they have put in."
IHUM Director Rob Robin
son said in an interview,"ln
many ways, one has to be sorry
that grades, and the pressure
leading to grade inflation, exist
at all. Ideally, students should be
in a class because they want to
learn from professors who want
to teach them subjects they are
passionate about."
1 le added, "Of course, this isn't
an ideal world."
Although a broad spectrum of
opinions can be expected at a uni
versity as large and diverse as Stan
ford, the inability of instructors to
agree on a consistent valuation of
work and standard of grading con
tinues to trouble students who
stress over their GPA.
"I definitely acknowledge that
grade inflation exists prominently
at Stanford, and — on one hand
— it makes sense, because if you're
going to a school whose academic

program is more challenging than
others, you should be rewarded in
some way," sophomore Geoff Mor
ris said. "But, at the same time, it
alsoiblurs the distinction between
students at Stanford and devalues
good work."
For Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose, examinations
and grading are the least fulfilling
aspects of his job.
"If we are to have grades," he
§aid, "then it seems to me that they
should be used to reward the best
work. So "hard" or "easy" grading
are not concepts that I have much
time for. I prefer the term 'fair.'"
Dallas Denery, a TF for the
I HUM course titled, "Democratic
Society," also made a distinction
between these terms.
"There is a difference between
grading 'hard' and grading 'un
fairly,' " Denery said. "If a student
thinks his work was graded unfair
ly, in the sense that other people in
the section received higher grades
for the same quality work, I will re
view it with him to see if he is cor
rect or not.
"Ifa student thinks they would
have received a higher grade had
another instructor graded their
work, I am less concerned.
There will always be some varia
tions in how people grade. Peo
ple are different."
Students who feel that their TA
has evaluated them unfairly can
turn to pages 46 and 47 of the Stan
ford Bulletin, which outline the
University's policy on student aca
demic grievance procedures.
University Registrar Roger
Printup explained that the process
is to be used by individual students
who have a complaint against a
faculty member or one of the other

groups mentioned in the policy.
As the procedure states, griev
ances "do not pertain to com
plaints expressing dissatisfaction
with a University policy chal
lenged on the grounds that the
policy is unfair or inadvisable."
Before a student files a griev
ance, he or she must first make
informal attempts at resolution
by discussing the problem with
the TA, professor, or depart
ment head.
"I'm always happy to re-read
and — if necessary — re-grade as
signments that students feel were
unfairly assessed," Breitrose said.
It should come as no surprise
that grading practices vary
across disciplines.
"Students will perceive that
some courses or departments con
sistently have patterns of higher
or lower grades than some norm,"
Printup said. He also said that this
issue has been reviewed by the
Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, on
which there is student representa
tion, and that discussions have
taken place between the commit
tee and the departments about
the philosophies of grading exist
ing at Stanford.
Since grade inflation and incon
sistency are not easily resolvable is
sues, for now students will have to
find comfort in knowing that edu
cators and administrators are
aware of the problem and express
eagerness to address it.
Ross acknowledged the
paradox that exists in the acad
emic world.
" The culture of academia is one
of tremendous independence, but
at the same time is a common effort
toward a common goal."
Have you ever slaved away on a paper
and gotten a "B" while a friend who un
doubtedly did not work as hard received
an "A?"
If the answer is "yes," then you are not
alone. In addition to rumors of grade in
flation, Stanford professors and teaching
assistants must also tackle the problem of
overall grading inconsistencies for stu
dent work. Classes with certain instructors
quickly acquire reputations of being
"hard" or "easy" due to a professors' grad
ing system, and some students plan their
schedules accordingly.
"After I switched [teaching fellows] in
my [Introduction to Humanities] course,

my grade improved significantly," sopho
more Uchenna Okoye said.
Is this just a coincidence or the result of
inconsistent grading among teaching fel
lows and assistants?
Cherri Ross, associate director of the
IHUM program, assured students that
teaching fellows undergo extensive train
ing that highlights the importance of
grade norming and the special needs of
college freshmen.
"We always try to look for discrepan
cies among the IHUM courses, but there
are disciplinary differences in each
course that make it difficult to ensure
total consistency throughout the pro
gram," Ross said.
Even though many freshmen feel that
IHUM grades are sometimes unfair, their
TPs make sure to emphasize the way stu
dents are evaluated with the help of a
handout. The handout describes in detail
what distinguishes "A" papers from "B"-
and "C"-level work. «
The supposed grading inconsis
tencies do not bother freshman
Antonio lannarone.
"Every grader will have a slight
ly different view on the quality of
the work he or she is grading, but I
