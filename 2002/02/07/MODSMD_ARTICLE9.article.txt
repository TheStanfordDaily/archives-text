# Senate discusses new projects
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate unveiled several new projects
and dealt with numerous funding
issues on its meeting on Tuesday.
Senators recounted plans to
improve campus life, funded
four campus groups, discussed
funding for restricted organiza
tions and began plans for the up
coming election.
Senate Deputy Chair Mike
Osofsky kicked off the meeting
by revealing plans to bring for
mer President Bill Clinton to
speak on campus as part of the
Senate's "Changing Tomorrow,
Today" program.
"We think it's probably about a
50-50 chance," Osofsky, a junior,
said. He said Clinton was open to
the idea of coming to Stanford
when approached after his recent
UC-Berkeley speech.
Sophomore Nick Rodriguez,
Student Life Committee chair,
announced the activation of the
Whoßides ride-sharing Web site
(whorides.stanford.edu). In ad
dition, logistics fora campus-wide
game of Assassins were near com
pletion. Senator Eric Lai, a ju
nior, was credited for the project,
part of his campaign promise of

bringing East and West campus
es together.
Senator Bo Cowgill, also a ju
nior, disclosed a plan to make the
Appropriations process digital,
thereby shortening the process
for both the ASSU Appropria
tions Committee and student
groups applying for funding.

"A lot of paperwork that has to
be pushed around can be re
duced to a few clicks," Cowgill
said.
On the funding front, the
Senate voted to approve funding
for student groups The Players,
The Stanford Steppers, Hong
Kong Student Association and
Stanford Hawai'i Club. Appro
priations Committee Chair
Megan Root noted general fee
funds were dwindling.
"We're going to run out of
money, I think," Root, a
sophomore, said, "so we need
to cut down funding and be
more careful."
Root also noted that the In
tersorority Council's General
Fee funding for Rush may have
to be repealed, because the

event is not technically open to
the entire campus and would vi
olate funding policy. If so, it
would be the first funding repeal
of the Senate year.
"New information came to life
as to the nature of Rush," Root ex
plained, "the exdusiveness."
Sorority Rush excludes men,
and the Interfraternity Council
hasn't contacted the Appropria
tions Committee for its Rush
funding — which would pre
sumably balance out the "no
boys allowed" provision of
Sorority Rush.
In addition, Sorority Rushees
must pay registration fees and the
number of women allowed to par
ticipate in Rush dwindles as
Sororities make aits.
The Appropriations Commit
tee will reexamine the issue at its
Sunday meeting. "My prediction
is that we'll fund stuff that applies
to all of the campus," Root said,
citing early Rush activities, which
are open to all women.
ISC and IPC- presidents were
unavailable for comment.
Graduate Student Council
Chair Felipe Santos, a third-year
doctoral student in Management
Science and Engineering, asked

the Senate to address major cam
pus issues such as housing,
health care, child care and inter
disciplinary programs in its
question-and-answer session
with President John Hennessey
next Tuesday.
Hennessy would attempt to
"slide" from the issues, Santos
warned. He said the ASSU ought

to phrase questions in the follow
ing manner: "'Given this prob
lem, given all the constraints that
we realize exist — what do yon in
tend to do?'"
Finally, the ASSU confirmed
the members of the Elections
Commission — sophomore Car
men Gutierrez, sophomore Gina
Moon and first-year law student
Tim Riemann — and noted that
ASSU candidacy and Special Fee
informational meetings would
occur next week on Monday and
Tuesday, respectively.
