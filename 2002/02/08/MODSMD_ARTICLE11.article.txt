Aguilar wins North Coast
pruning contest
FORESTVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Vicente Aguilar is the
new king of North Coast vineyard primers.
Aguilar won $2,500 Wednesday, along with the region's
first-ever grapevine pruning championship.
The competition was held at Santa Rosa Junior College's
Shone Farm near Forestville.
To win the title, Aguilar, 49, had to defeat top primers
from Sonoma, Napa, Lake, Mendocino and Marin counties.
The secret of his success?
"Concentration and a little talk with Cod," he said.
More than 175 pruners competed in preliminary rounds
last month. The top 10 were entered in Wednesday's
prune-off.
