On Feb. 8, 1971, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about students protesting the invasion
of Laos.
"Reacting swiftly to the official announce
ment of the Laotian invasion, some 250 per
sons roamed around the campus for an hour
last night, smashing at least 100 windows and
lights with large rocks and bricks. A Universi
ty spokesperson estimated damage 'in the
thousands of dollars.'
"No injuries or arrests were reported, al
though a policeman was nearly hit in the
head by a rock as he stood in front ol Presi
dent Lyman's office (Building 10).
"Windows were also broken in two Stan
ford Police Department cars. One of the po
lice cars was trashed as it flashed a spotlight
on demonstrators hurling rocks into the Lou
1 lenry Hoover building.
"Several lights broke out between demon
strators and other people — including mem
bers of the Free Campus Movement — who
were attempting to stop the trashing.
"Pine Hall, the University's computation
center, was briefly evacuated after a tele
phoned bomb threat at about 10 p.m. After
searching the building, firemen allowed peo
ple to re-enter. .. .
"Thirty-five police deputies from, the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department
were called to campus as the first reports of
damage were received, according to Bruce
Wiggins, the University's public safety direc
tor. They arrived after the trashing had
ended at 10:30 p.m. and saw little action on
campus.
Bottom line: Unlike the police in 1971, Tony Giovoc
chini did see action on campus after 10:30 p.m. last
night. Smashing, baby.
