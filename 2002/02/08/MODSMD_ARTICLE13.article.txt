# Flight crew subdues attacking passenger

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — An un
ruly passenger on a United Airlines flight from
Miami to Buenos Aires tried to force his way
into the cockpit yesterday, managing to smash
in part oft he door before a co-pilot clubbed him
with a small ax.
Other crew and several passengers then
began wrestling with Pablo Moreira, 28, subdu
ing him after a chaotic, 10-minute struggle.
Moreira, a banker from Uruguay, was re
strained for the remainder of the flight, the air
line and the FBI said. A flight attendant also re
ceived minor injuries in the struggle.
Moreira, who was lucid and in stable cOndi

tion, was arrested when the jetliner landed safe
ly in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires as
scheduled at 10:30 a.m. local time, said Judy
Orihuela, an FBI spokeswoman in Miami. He
was provided medical treatment.
It was not clear what prompted the man to
try to enter the cockpit. Orihuela said he was
not armed and did not appear drunk. Gor
don Johndroe, a spokesman for President
Bush's Homeland Security Council, said
there was nothing to indicate the incident was
an act of terrorism.
Argentine authorities said they were investi
gating whether Moreira was under the influ

ence of drugs or mentally distraught. "He
doesn't remember what happened," said Jorge
Reta, a Argentine Air Force spokesman.
The incident raised new questions about ac
cess to airplane cockpits in the wake of I he Sept.
II terrorist attacks. United Airlines — along
with American — have reinforced their cockpit
doors with metal bars, but some passenger ad
vocacy groups insisted yesterday that further
steps are needed.
United spokeswoman Chris Nardella said
Moreira kicked in a small panel and managed
to get his head inside the cockpit before the co
pilot hit him.
