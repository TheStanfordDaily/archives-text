WASHINCHON (AV) — For
mer Enron chief executive Jeff rey
Skilling insisted to skeptical law
makers yesterday that he knfcw of
nothing improper about the com
plex web of partnerships thar
brought down the company,
draining the savings of millions of
investors and employees.
Four of Skilling's former col
leagues at the energy-trading con
glomerate remained silent and re
fused to testify, invoking their con
stitutional privilege.
Back in August, when he re
signed his post, "1 did not believe
I he company was in any financial
peril," Skilling said, testifying
under tough questioning in his
first public accounting of the col
lapse. "I absolutely, unequivocal
ly thought the company was in
good shape."
The company's financial
statements, "as far as I knew, ac
curately reflected" Enron's con
dition, Skilling told the House
Energy and Commerce over
sight subcommittee.
lie said he had no knowledge
that the partnerships run by his
longtime colleague Andrew Fas
tow, who collected at least $!H) mil
lion for his efforts, were designed
to conceal massive losses.
Skilling spoke after Fastow and
three other current or former
Enron executives declined to an
swer questions at the hearing, cit
ing their Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
"It was my understanding that
the purpose of the transactions
was to provide a real hedge" —

locking in profits from technology
investments, the former chief ex
ecutive said.
Skilling, who resigned before
Enron's troubles became public,
insisted he didn't know the details
of the partnerships that concealed
hundreds of millions of dollars in
debt and overstated the company's
profits by more than $1 billion
over several years.
Skilling also said he could not
recall key events under close ques
tioning by lawmakers.
In contrast to Skilling's state
ments, Enron's new president and
chief operating officer, Jeffrey
McMahon, testified earlier at the
hearing that he was transferred to
a new job shortly after he com
plained to Skilling about the ob
scure partnerships in a 30-minute
meeting in March 2000. Mc Ma
hon was treasurer at the time of
the meeting.
At the dramatic hearing, as
Congress pressed its sprawling in
quiry into the- biggest bankruptcy
in U.S. history, lawmakers de
nounced Fastow and the three
other current or former Enron ex
ecutives who sal silently before
them.
They called them "economic
terrorists," "business cowboys"
and "corporate thieves," accusing
them of enriching themselves
while thousands of Enron employ
ees watched their retirement sav
ings dissolve in 401(k) accounts
heavy with company stock.
"Was the selling of your morals
... of your souls, worth it?" asked
Rep. Bobby Rush, I)-111.
