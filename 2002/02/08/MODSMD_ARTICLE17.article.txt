Attack on tuition increase 'baseless'
No one wants to pay higher tuition,
but I was very dismayed to read the com
ments written by Meghana Reddy in a
letter to The Daily on Feb. 7.
Reddy jumped to one conclusion
after another without citing any evi
dence to support them, illustrating a
profound lack of understanding of how
Stanford operates.
If Ms. Reddy had undertaken some
research in an attempt to more fully un
derstand why the Board of Trustees
would raise undergraduate tuition by
4.9 percent, she would have realized, for
instance, that undergraduate tuition
covers only (i() percent of the actual cost
of educating each student and that in
come from the endowment provided
only 1 8 percent of the operating costs of
the university last year.
She would have recognized that al
though an $8 billion endowment may
seem to be an enormous source of money,
it is small in comparison to others (e.g.,
Harvard's at $18.3 billion), especially
when the growth of these endowments is
extrapolated into the future and the scope
of this university's operations are account
ed for. Stanford doesn't even rank among
the top 10 universities in terms of amount
of endowment per student.
Reddy also would have understood

that the goal of the Campaign for Under
graduate Education is to endow under
graduate scholarships and Stanford's
new innovative and distinctive under
graduate programs so that their place in
the curriculum is secured permanently.
Although landscaping, building
maintenance and dining hall quality are
issues that face every university, they
certainly are not the driving force be
hind the tuition increase; providing a
unsurpassed quality of education to
every Stanford student is the driving
force. Redely should be ashamed of her
baseless attack.

Wais sidestepped Judicial Board in
Kappa Sigma probation case
As the Chair of the Greek Judicial
Board tor the past two years, the adjudi
cation of Kappa Sigma Case was one of
my primary responsibilities. In reading
the article in The Daily, 1 want to clarify
that the decision to place Kappa Sigma
on alcohol probation was not a recom
mendation made by the Greek Judicial
Board.
This case was unique, controversial
and difficult. In the end, it was not a se
ries of fire code violations that led to this

alcohol probation, as your article im
plies. This case was the first time in my
two years Chair of the Board that
Dean Wais has issued a decision that de
viated from the Greek Judicial Board's
recommendations.
In short, while the severity of the is
sues cannot be contested, I think that the
student body should know that their
peers on the review board were not in
favor of the added sanction. The Board
was very concerned about the impact
such severe sanctions would have on the
fraternity as a whole.
We felt that there were many
strengths in Kappa Sigma's organization
and responsible measures had been
taken by the fraternity leadership in
many of the incidents.
