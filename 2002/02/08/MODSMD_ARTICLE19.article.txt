## Fox leaves fans blacked out from classic battle 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
How big was last night's game
against Oregon?
Head coach Mike Mont
gomery sent a "personal" e-mail
to all Sixth Man Club members
thanking them in advance for
their support.
A Dollie reunion was sched
uled conveniently for the night.
Twenty-seven white-gloved
dancers performed their own
respective renditions of "All
Right Now" as well as a slew of
other routines.
Ex-Cardinal team member,
and Los Angeles Laker Mark
Madsen stopped by to See his old
teammates in action.
And Stanford's all-time leading
football receiver, Troy Walters
even came out to see the game.
The only two things missing
from Maples last night were the
recently introduced 'Mini-tree,'
and a live television feed.
Hut at least the 'Mini-tree' had
an excuse.
A Thursday night game fora
ten-year-old might interfere with
homework, hut the absence ofTV
coverage really wasn't warranted.
The brilliant minds at Fox
Sports opted to cover the epic
battle between unranked Cali
fornia and unranked Oregon
State instead, leaving Cardinal
fans in the dark.
"It's unfortunate that this
game was not a televised game
because that was one heck of a
college basketball game," said
Oregon head coach Ernie Kent.
"What a great job by two out
standing teams, two outstand
ing players and the perfor
mance they put forth out on the
floor was just remarkable. It is
an unbelievable atmosphere to
play in."
Fox Sports missed out and if
you weren't there, you missed
out too, on one of the best
games the Pac-10 has had to
offer this season.
It was the meeting of two very

different underdogs. Oregon,
still trying to prove its worthiness
to the world, and Stanford still
trying to prove its worth.
"I guess people got their
money's worth tonight," said
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Every time
[Oregon] needed a basket
tonight, they came through."
But the Cardinal came
through too tonight, in front of
a capacity crowd, bursting at its

seams with excitement and sup
port. The only people not sport
ing Stanford red were the 12 or
so players on Oregon's roster
and the Ducks coaching stall.
And despite the support,
there were definitely times last
night when it looked as though
Stanford just wasn't going to
pull things through.
It took a three-point shot
