## Fox leaves fans blacked out from classic battle 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
How big was last night's game
against Oregon?
Head coach Mike Mont
gomery sent a "personal" e-mail
to all Sixth Man Club members
thanking them in advance for
their support.
A Dollie reunion was sched
uled conveniently for the night.
Twenty-seven white-gloved
dancers performed their own
respective renditions of "All
Right Now" as well as a slew of
other routines.
Ex-Cardinal team member,
and Los Angeles Laker Mark
Madsen stopped by to See his old
teammates in action.
And Stanford's all-time leading
football receiver, Troy Walters
even came out to see the game.
The only two things missing
from Maples last night were the
recently introduced 'Mini-tree,'
and a live television feed.
Hut at least the 'Mini-tree' had
an excuse.
A Thursday night game fora
ten-year-old might interfere with
homework, hut the absence ofTV
coverage really wasn't warranted.
The brilliant minds at Fox
Sports opted to cover the epic
battle between unranked Cali
fornia and unranked Oregon
State instead, leaving Cardinal
fans in the dark.
"It's unfortunate that this
game was not a televised game
because that was one heck of a
college basketball game," said
Oregon head coach Ernie Kent.
"What a great job by two out
standing teams, two outstand
ing players and the perfor
mance they put forth out on the
floor was just remarkable. It is
an unbelievable atmosphere to
play in."
Fox Sports missed out and if
you weren't there, you missed
out too, on one of the best
games the Pac-10 has had to
offer this season.
It was the meeting of two very

different underdogs. Oregon,
still trying to prove its worthiness
to the world, and Stanford still
trying to prove its worth.
"I guess people got their
money's worth tonight," said
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Every time
[Oregon] needed a basket
tonight, they came through."
But the Cardinal came
through too tonight, in front of
a capacity crowd, bursting at its

seams with excitement and sup
port. The only people not sport
ing Stanford red were the 12 or
so players on Oregon's roster
and the Ducks coaching stall.
And despite the support,
there were definitely times last
night when it looked as though
Stanford just wasn't going to
pull things through.
It took a three-point shot

Senior Tony Giovacchini is embraced by junior teammates Casey Jacob
sen and Curtis Borchardt after nailing a game-tying three-pointer with
four seconds to go in regulation.
from senior Tony Giovacchini
with lour seconds left in the game
to remind everyone that the Car
dinal could win.
"We probably deserve that win
after some of the games that
we've lost," Montgomery said.
"It's pleasing to see us step up late
and make the plays that we need
ed to make."
The key matchup of the night
was between ()regon's version of
Casey Jacobsen, Luke Jackson
and Jacobsen himself. Jackson
proved himself a solid offensive
player, often silencing the crowd
with stunning fade-awayjumpers.

Hut Jacobsen, the original,
had his share of tricks as well. He
was his usual self, weaving his way
through crowds of people, and
hitting the open jumper when
necessary.
He finished the night with a
'quiet' 41 points.
Stanford finally won a close
game this time.
What was the difference?
Defensive rebounding and an
improved ability to hit a free
throw in the clutch.
Sophomore joe Kirchofer
played extremely well down the
stretch. Unphased by the close
game, Kirchofer made a confident
move to the basket fora lay up with
two minutes left to play.
And Giovacchini who went
three-for-four in the final min

utes of the game to seal the deal,
not to mention hitting the shot
that sent the game into overtime.
"We jue so ecstatic right now,"
said freshman guard Chris Her
nandez. "We are so pumped.
That was a big win for us to come
out and beat Oregon."
Whether or not people want
to admit it or not, there's just
something about watching Stan
lord climb that mountain that
doesn't allow you to give up
hope just yet. There's just some
thing about the struggle that is a
bit refreshing and reassuring
and optimistic.
Finally the Sixth Man Club
will get to see the Cardinal peak
in February, as opposed to earli
er years when downhill was the
only place left for Stanford to go.

What was the difference?
Defensive rebounding and an
improved ability to hit a free
throw in the clutch.
Sophomore joe Kirchofer
played extremely well down the
stretch. Unphased by the close
game, Kirchofer made a confident
move to the basket fora lay up with
two minutes left to play.
And Giovacchini who went
three-for-four in the final min

utes of the game to seal the deal,
not to mention hitting the shot
that sent the game into overtime.
"We jue so ecstatic right now,"
said freshman guard Chris Her
nandez. "We are so pumped.
That was a big win for us to come
out and beat Oregon."
Whether or not people want
to admit it or not, there's just
something about watching Stan
lord climb that mountain that
doesn't allow you to give up
hope just yet. There's just some
thing about the struggle that is a
bit refreshing and reassuring
and optimistic.
Finally the Sixth Man Club
will get to see the Cardinal peak
in February, as opposed to earli
er years when downhill was the
only place left for Stanford to go.
How big was last night's game
against Oregon?
Head coach Mike Mont
gomery sent a "personal" e-mail
to all Sixth Man Club members
thanking them in advance for
their support.
A Dollie reunion was sched
uled conveniently for the night.
Twenty-seven white-gloved
dancers performed their own
respective renditions of "All
Right Now" as well as a slew of
other routines.
Ex-Cardinal team member,
and Los Angeles Laker Mark
Madsen stopped by to See his old
teammates in action.
And Stanford's all-time leading
football receiver, Troy Walters
even came out to see the game.
The only two things missing
from Maples last night were the
recently introduced 'Mini-tree,'
and a live television feed.
Hut at least the 'Mini-tree' had
an excuse.
A Thursday night game fora
ten-year-old might interfere with
homework, hut the absence ofTV
coverage really wasn't warranted.
The brilliant minds at Fox
Sports opted to cover the epic
battle between unranked Cali
fornia and unranked Oregon
State instead, leaving Cardinal
fans in the dark.
"It's unfortunate that this
game was not a televised game
because that was one heck of a
college basketball game," said
Oregon head coach Ernie Kent.
"What a great job by two out
standing teams, two outstand
ing players and the perfor
mance they put forth out on the
floor was just remarkable. It is
an unbelievable atmosphere to
play in."
Fox Sports missed out and if
you weren't there, you missed
out too, on one of the best
games the Pac-10 has had to
offer this season.
It was the meeting of two very

different underdogs. Oregon,
still trying to prove its worthiness
to the world, and Stanford still
trying to prove its worth.
"I guess people got their
money's worth tonight," said
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Every time
[Oregon] needed a basket
tonight, they came through."
But the Cardinal came
through too tonight, in front of
a capacity crowd, bursting at its

seams with excitement and sup
port. The only people not sport
ing Stanford red were the 12 or
so players on Oregon's roster
and the Ducks coaching stall.
And despite the support,
there were definitely times last
night when it looked as though
Stanford just wasn't going to
pull things through.
It took a three-point shot

Senior Tony Giovacchini is embraced by junior teammates Casey Jacob
sen and Curtis Borchardt after nailing a game-tying three-pointer with
four seconds to go in regulation.
from senior Tony Giovacchini
with lour seconds left in the game
to remind everyone that the Car
dinal could win.
"We probably deserve that win
after some of the games that
we've lost," Montgomery said.
"It's pleasing to see us step up late
and make the plays that we need
ed to make."
The key matchup of the night
was between ()regon's version of
Casey Jacobsen, Luke Jackson
and Jacobsen himself. Jackson
proved himself a solid offensive
player, often silencing the crowd
with stunning fade-awayjumpers.

Hut Jacobsen, the original,
had his share of tricks as well. He
was his usual self, weaving his way
through crowds of people, and
hitting the open jumper when
necessary.
He finished the night with a
'quiet' 41 points.
Stanford finally won a close
