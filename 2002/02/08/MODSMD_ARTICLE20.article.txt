## 
### KAT LAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal campaign to regain consistency,
confidence, and standing begins this weekend as
No. 6 Stanford (5-5, 4-3, Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) laces No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara (6-3, 3-
3, MPSF) tonight, and No. 13 Cal State-Northi idge
(5-4, 2-3 MPSF) Saturday.
Bottom line: The Stanford squad needs to win
twice this weekend.
Stanford fell four spots in the rankings after ex
tending its losing streak to four matches last weekend.
Despite the recent dry spell, it would be prema
ture to assume a bleak outlook for Cardinal volley
ball this season. After splitting matches with defend
ing NCAA Champion Brigham Young and picking
up big conference victories against three top-15
teams earlier in the season, the Stanford squad has

already shown that il is a national contender.
It isn't a lack ol talent that is preventing Stanford
wins; it is a lack of consistency.
"Our goal is to get to a point where we know we are
going to be at a consistent, high level of play," said coach
Don Shaw.
In last week's series of matches against No. 3 1 lawaii,
No. 9 Lewis and No. 5 Penn State, the Cardinal strug
gled to make the right plays at the- right times.
Now, after a week of practice and recover)', Stanford
heads to Santa Barbara revitalized and ready to win.
When Stanford and UC-Santa Barbara faced off
earlier in the season, double-digit kills from junior
opposite Curt Toppel propelled the (Cardinal to
victory in four close games.
The Gauchos broke Southern California's seven
game winning streak last week, but were then swept
by No. 2 Pepperdine last Friday.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will look to follow up
a 3-0 sweep over the Matadors at Maples Pavilion
on Jan. 25. The Cardinal will be more wary of the
Matadors this time after Northridge managed to
push Pepperdine to five games last week.
Victories this weekend are crucial not only for
Stanford's confidence and pride, but also because
the two conference matches are critical to Stan
ford's postseason aspirations.
"The goal of winning the National Champi
onship is definitely in the back of our minds, and in
our case, it's a realistic goal," said Shaw.
Only four teams qualify for the NCAA tourna
ment, and only the winner of the MPSF tourna
ment is guaranteed a spot among teams in the con
ference, although the one at-large berth in the
tournament will likely go to an MPSF squad as well.
The MPSF currently boasts 10 of the top 15 teams
in the country.
With two returning All-American players, eight
returning lettermen, and a promising class of
freshmen, the Cardinal is in good shape to vie for
one of those two playoff spots.
"This is one of our best shots so far at winning
the whole thing," said Toppel, who leads the team
with 5.55 kills per game.
