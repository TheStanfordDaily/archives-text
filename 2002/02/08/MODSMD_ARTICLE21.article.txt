Thursday: No. 2 Stanford 77, Oregon 72

Stanford squeaked by a stubborn Duck, squad 77-
72 to improve to 23-1 overall and remain perfect in
the Pacific 10 Conference at"l 3-0.
The loss drops Oregon to .500 in the conference,
but "the Pit" lived up to its reputation and the
sharp-shooting Ducks gave Stanford its biggest
scare of the season.
Both teams opened strong, jumping into an ag
gressive, physical game that characterized the
night. The Cardinal scored the first bucket of the
night of an inside move from senior center Bethany
Donaphin. 'l he Ducks responded tit-for-tat, taking
the lead, with a little over 11 minutes left in the first
half on a 6-0 Oregon run.
Sophomore forward Nicole Powell found
Donaphin wide open in the paint and tossed it inside
to bring the Cardinal within one. Freshman guard
Sebnem Kimyacioglu continued to dazzle with her
shooting skills, nailing a three-pointer on the next
play to put the Cardinal up 22-20.
The battle continued between the two teams as
Stanford built its lead. Going into the locker room, the
Cardinal was ahead by a'comfortable 38-31 margin.
The comfort zone the team had managed to pull
together was destroyed as Oregon exploded into the

second half.
Led by the Duck's leading scorer junior guard
Shaquala Williams, the team knocked in 12 of its first
19 shots. Williams finished the night with 22 points
and helped her team shoot an impressive 56 percent
in the second half.
For its part, Stanford had some dismal shooting in
the half, hitting only 9 of its 31 shots from the floor.
Oregon overpowered the Cardinal from first
whistle, taking the lead and running the score up to
50-46 with about 13 minutes remaining for its
largest lead of the night.
With the Ducks looking to extend their home
court winning streak, Stanford settled down and
staged its comeback.
Kimyacioglu scored on two free throws to bring
the score within four points and Lindsey Yamasaki,
who scored a game-high 24 points in het home state,
nailed a huge three to cut the Oregon lead to one.
Powell took the Oregon response on the other
end of the court personally, and drove in with a
dazzling spin move before coming right back
with a three-pointer just inside 10 minutes to tie
the game up at 56. Powell finished the night with
20 points.
Both teams put on a defensive clinic for the next
five minutes as the score remained locked at 56
apiece. Oregon was the first to get a break and Stan
lord, still not feeling its shot from the field, began to
score on a veritable shower of free throws, led by the
leading free-throw shooter in the conference, fresh
man guard Kelley Suminski.
Suminski, demonstrating uncanny poise, hit a per-
feet nine-of-nine from the free
throw line on the evening to lead
her team to victory. The freshman
has made 30 of her last 31 attempts
at the free throw line.
Indeed, as a team Stanford
shot well from the line, going
26-of-31 on the night and scor

ing its last 19 points off foul
shots.
While it was more uerve
wracking than most predicted,
the game tested the Cardinal's
nerves, which proved to be rock
solid. The team only needs one
more win to clinch the Pac-10
title and guarantee a top seed in
the conference tournament, but,
as witnessed tonight, the road
ahead of Stanford is anything
but smooth.
