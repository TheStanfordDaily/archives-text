# Stanford, FSU renew rivalry
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
for the past three years, the
coast-to-coast rivalry between
the Stanford and Florida State
baseball programs carried the
label of "budding."
Sure, the rivalry is only 11
games old, but after three classic
clashes in Omaha and one rotation
through the home-and-home
setup, the cross-country competi
tion is now in full bloom.
Coming off an exhausting and
demoralizing pair of back-to-back
losses in the 1998 College World
Series to the Seminoles, the 1999
Cardinal squad managed just one
revenge-minded victory in Talla

hassee's Dick Howser Stadium.
Despite plenty of motivation, the
unanimously top-ranked Stanford
team couldn't overcome a veteran
Florida State squad intent on pro
tecting its home field.
But last season, a young and un
proven Cardinal shocked head
coach Mike Martin's Seminoles at
Sunken Diamond, picking up a se
ries sweep that gave Stanford the
shot of confidence it badly needed
to propel it through its magical
t un to Omaha.
Now, the Cardinal (2-1) again
finds itself the nation's undisput
ed No. 1 team traveling to sunny
Florida fora three game series.
The No. 6 Seminoles (6-1),
ranked as high as No. 2 in one of

Hawaii and riding a three-game
win streak.
Though it's an early-season,
non-conference meeting, this one
could be the short rivalry's best yet.
Each team returns a host of po
sition players and starting pitchers
from successful groups last year,
raising the.stakes and measuring
stick implications of the series at
Dick I lowser Stadium.
Stanford lived up to its top
billing last weekend at home
against No. 15 Cal State-Fuller
ton, giving outstanding perfor
mances both at the plate and on
the mound.
The Cardinal beat up the Ti
tans' pitching at a .357 clip, scoring
27 runs against one of the most tal
ented stalls in the country. Behind
the two quality starts of juniors Je
remy Guthrie and Tim Cunning
ham, and exceptional relief from
five .Cardinal pitchers (13A IP,
1.35 ERA, 14 S()), Stanford picked
up two big wins to open the season.

prove to be a valuable one. He
couldn't make it out of the second
inning in Sunday's 6-3 loss to
Fullerton, but the nerves should
affect him less prominently the
next time he heads to the hill.
The ouly question is when
that time will come. Head coach
Mark Marquess did not an
nounce a starter for Sunday's
game, so junior Ryan McCally
and sophomore John Hudgins
should be in the running for an
early-season start.
This Sunday's starter "will be
determined by who we feel we
need to Use in the first two

[games]," Marquess said. "At this
time of year, 1 would expect that
if we have a chance to win, we
would go ahead and use someone
we needed." .
Complementing the excellent
Cardinal pitching against Fuller
ton were the lively Stanford bats,
which were especially on display
in Saturday's 17-1 rout. Junior
Jason Cooper's early-season suc
cess (.583, 4 RBI) paced the Car
dinal, as did career performances
from junior Ryan Garko and
sophomore Brian Hall.
"We're good, I don't know
how else to put it," Cooper said.
"This year I think we've got a lot
more pop, one through nine."
Florida State brings back all
live of its 2001 starting pitchers
and seven position players, all

hungry due to a rare absence
from Omaha last June.
Senior Blair Varnes (0-0, 0.00
FRA) will take the mound this af
ternoon at 12:30 p.m. against
Guthrie (1-0, 3.00) in a battle of
two potentially elite draft picks
this June.
Tomorrow's 11 a.m. matinee
will match two southpaws in Cun
ningham (1-0, 1.50) and Semi
nole junior Matt Lynch (2-0,
0.00), who was named by ESPN's
Peter Gammons as the Cape Cod
League's second-best prospect
this past summer.
Sunday, Cardinal fans will
have to get up early as the action
gets underway at 10 a.m. local
time. Against the undetermined
Cardinal starter, Martin will call
on junior Robby Read (2-0, 1.64).
