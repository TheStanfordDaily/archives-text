No. 19 Pacific, doubleheader,

Tigers out of the playoffs to earn its
first ever trip to the Women's Col
lege World Series.
But the history between the two
teams reaches far past the 2001 sea
son. Two years prior, Pacific con
tributed to ending the Stan ford sea
son early in regional play.
The twin bill will also feature a

reunion lor (Cardinal senior Jessica
Mendoza and Tiger pitcher Cindy
Ball, who both once served as the
battery lot their high school solt
hall squad.
"It is going to be a really great
game," said senior Sarah Beeson.
"We have both knocked each other
out of regionals and have a history
between us. I think we are both re
ally excited to play each other."
The Cardinal will look to con
tinue its success from its opening
weekend sweep of Santa Clara.
"Last weekend will be good to
build on because there was a lot of
enthusiasm after the Santa Clara
doubleheader," said junior pitcher
Tori Nyberg. "We now have some
momentum to build on."
Stanford emerged from last
weekend without giving up an
earned run and with 18 hits under
its belt. But the Cardinal realizes

that this weekend is its first chal
lenge against a ranked opponent.
"This will be our first real test as
a team," Mendoza said. "We will
find out if we are able to provide
the offense, defense and the whole
picture against a top-20 team."
Pacific is also oil to a fast start
after beating No. 5 California in
convinc ing fashion last weekend to
open its season.
"When you see what they did to
California last weekend, shutting
them out 4-0, you know that you
have to be ready to perform," said
Stanford head coach John Rittman.
The Cardinal offense will lace
its toughest battle to date this Sat
urday as Ball, a third-team All-
American, will lead Pacific from
the circle. Ball earned All-Regional
Tournament accolades last season
for her performance in the play
oils. which included a vic tory over

the Cardinal.
"Seeing that Candy Ball isanAll-
American, offensively we need to
prepare," said junior Kira Ching.
"With Hall we have to take advan
tage of first-pitch strikes. We just
need to be prepared at the plate."
Since many on the Stanford ros
ter have faced Ball before, the Car
dinal needs only to look at its past
experiences to scout the Tiger ace,
now tied for first in Pacific history
with 31 career shutouts.
"A positive aspect is that she is a
senior and so a lot of us have seen
her," Beeson said. "We know that
she is going to throw down in the
strike /.one and we just have to cap
italize on her mistakes."
Stanford's pitching staff is also
ready for its first real test of the
season against the Tigers.
