# Faculty senate extends Sym Sys five more years
## Brewer calls Faculty Senate's interdisciplinary-program resolutions "band-aids" 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate at its meeting yesterday unani
mously approved a five-year renewal (beginning in
the fall) for the Latin American Studies program's
honors certification and the Symbolic Systems pro
gram's B.S. degree.
After a complex, extended review, the Senate de
cided to finalize the termination of Latin American
Studies' bachelor's and master's degree programs.
In order to add an extra level of support for stu
dents who take courses in other majors, a committee
recommended a stand-alone honors program that
would not require department backing.
Junior Matt Brewer, president of the ASSU, rep
resented the undergraduate student perspective at
the meeting.
"I think it's great that they are supplementing Latin
American Studies with the honors
program, hut it's only a band-aid
on the deeper wound of what was
once a major," Brewer said. " Fhis
is not the end-all solution. I think
ii's great that interdisciplinary
studies exist at Stanford because
they propel a greater sense of di
verse education."
"Facilitating the research inter
est of Stanford students through
these rigorous means allows them
to pursue these studies in the
breadth and depth they deserve,"
said James Fox, professor of an
thropt )logy.
'Flic interdisciplinary programs
allow students to overlap classes in
different majors, but the minor
and the honors program will be in
dependent of one another.
The Faculty Senate expects that
the Latin American Studies Pro
gram will receive Spanish, Por
tuguese and International Rela
tions majors, as well as students
who study overseas.
"We don't need a huge num
ber; we just want to accommodate
the students who fare interested],"
Fox said.
"A lot of students had the in
tention of majoring in Latin
American Studies and with its in

stant discontinuation, some stu
dents feel that the value of diverse
programs have been shot down a
little," Brewer said. "With the
honors program, students will
have a forum to express their aca
demic passions. The value that it
will offer is definitely a necessity."
" Flie honors program will
broaden support around the
school for Latin American Studies
and help the department move in
the direction it wants to," said I lu
manities and Sciences Dean
Sharon Long.
Fhe Faculty Senate also took
action on the Symbolic Systems
program.
With 65 graduates in 2001, Sym
Sys has grown significantly, rapidly
expanding ( lass offerings.
Symbolic Systems professor
Bruce Wooley indicated the need
for spreading out the advising
load and developing senior collo
quiums instead of standard cap
stone courses.
Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts expressed his-admiration
for the program.
"Symbolic Systems takes com
puting ideas and brings them into
the context of humanities and sci
ences, bridging the gap," Roberts
said. "It's a wonderful thing."
At the meeting, University Pres
ident John Hcnnessy also gave an
update on the actions the adminis
tration has taken on wage rates lot

subccmtracted wc >rkers.
"Stanford is in the process of de
veloping a living wage policy for all
people who work on campus, with
an initial $ 10.10 per hour for work
ers with health benefits," I lennessy
said. "It will cover all workers who
are contracted to work for at least
one year."
Administrators expect to final
ize contracts by fall.
"Hopefully, this will improve
the quality of the experience peo
ple have while working at Stan
ford," I lennessy said.
Professor Ramon Saldivar, chair
of the Comparative Literature de
partment, commended students
for raising awareness of this issue.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy pointed out that Stan
ford "is not legally requited fto in
state this policy] but morally decid
ed [to take action]."
Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman also
presented a status report on the
Campaign for Undergraduate
Education, saying the campaign
has secured $690 million in
pledges, reaching two-thirds ol its
$ 1 billion goal.
I he I hink Again l our, geared
towards attracting alumni and par
ents, has been helpful in this
lundraising endeavor, reconnect
ing members of the extended Stan
ford community with current uni
versity programs.

tention of majoring in Latin
American Studies and with its in

stant discontinuation, some stu
dents feel that the value of diverse
programs have been shot down a
little," Brewer said. "With the
honors program, students will
have a forum to express their aca
demic passions. The value that it
will offer is definitely a necessity."
" Flie honors program will
broaden support around the
school for Latin American Studies
and help the department move in
the direction it wants to," said I lu
manities and Sciences Dean
Sharon Long.
