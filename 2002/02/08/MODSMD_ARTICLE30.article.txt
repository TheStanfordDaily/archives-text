# On an Intermission from God
## 
### ROBERT ZIMMERMAN 
Kim Samek and Eric Hand's last Intermission issue as
editors came out last Friday. Many feared that their de
parture would mean chaos in the halls of the Daily, par
ticularly in the hovel known as the Intermission office.
Alas, these morbid predictions never came to pass. Exem-

plifying a peaceful transfer of power, two
young men have inherited Samek and
Hand's seats at the forefront of arts and en
tertainment criticism here at Stanford. An
thony Ha and Kareem Ghanem are here to
stay — at least until the end of this volume.
Naturally, the pair has many ambitions
for the coming months of Intermission.

"We want to keep it exciting," said Ghanem, "and sassy
and profane."
"Edgy," adds Ha. Asked to elaborate, he shrugs. "You
know ... edgy."
As anyone with an ounce of writing experience
knows, however, Ghanem and Ha have quite a task
ahead of them.

Pondering this over a bottle of
water and a ('.hex cereal bar, Ghanem
gazes skyward when asked how he will
realize these goals. Rising to go to the
bathroom, he returns a half hour later.
With a slight gleam in his big brown
eyes and a loving gaze, he offers an
answer.

"We will ask for the input and opinions of the readers,"
he declares, adding later, "And we will ask people to join
our staff."
Ghanem is an imposing man — with a sexy Middle
Eastern demeanor and bright red Converse All-Stars, he
is a sure distraction for any man or woman.
And then we have Anthony Ha ... a pathetic specimen
if there ever was one. First and foremost among his nu
merous flaws is his height. Let me be perfectly clear — Ha
is short.
Real short.
He claims to be 5'5", but probably stands closer to 5'4".
More disturbingly, Ha continues to deny his deficiency
and attacks anyone who brings it up.
"I can't help it if everyone else is freakishly tall," he
complains.
Equally distressing is his obsession with "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer." Under duress, Ha reluctantly admitted
to pre-ordering the entire first season on DVD a month
before it was released and to frequenting the "Buffy" chat
rooms several times a day.
"'Buffy' is the greatest show of all time!" he whines.
"Creator / writer / director Joss Whedon understands the
existential angst that is my life!"

When asked about the existence of several novel
length works of "BufFy"-porn attributed to him, Ha claims
complete ignorance.
While most people should be allowed their childish
indulgences, the editorial position at Intermission is one
of special prestige and power. I shudder to think what
will happen to Intermission's reputation as a champion
of cultural standards when Ha's geeky little hands take
the reins.
With these two dubious characters at the reins of In
termission, what will the magazine's future be? Perhaps it
would be wise to take the advice of the man who once de
clared that "the un-aimed arrow never misses." Personal
ly, I left feeling that these two are in way over their heads.

"I can't help it if everyone else is freakishly tall."
