# 'Fanclub' loses members
## 
### ERIC HAND 
With their sixth album in a lit
tle over a decade, (lie members
of Teenage Fanclub can rightful
ly call themselves veterans of the
retro pop-rock scene. But with
their latest album, "Howdy!",

the Fannies seem ever more reactionary
and antiquated. Is it time for these vets to
check into the VA hospital?
Though the Fannies are from Scot
land, their sound is just this side of late
'60s California: seductive melodies,
bright jangling guitars, tight Beach Boys
harmonies and nonchalant lyrics. For
those of you whose knowledge of rock
history is limited to Britney's latest Pepsi
commercial, we're talking about the
Beach Blanket Bingo vignette, where
Britney looks like Gidget.
But their sound is not entirely deriva
tive. With their earlier albums, there was
a roughness and an edge that contrasted
nicely with the soothingly sweet vocals,
and this earned them the right to tour
with giants like Nirvana and Oasis.
But on "Howdy!", the waves of feed
back and moments of distortion are gone.
The Fannies have bit through the sour
apple Blow-Pop crust and are numbly

chewing on the
gummy center.
Still, as anyone
with a Blow-Pop
fetish should know,
the gummy center
may very well be
the best part —

and its sweetness lasts a lot longer than
you think.
My favorite tracK. — and the first sin
gle to be released-is "Dumb Dumb
Dumb." It begins with a stereophonic
back and forth between dueling guitars.
Norman Blake (vocals, guitar) enters
with a pleading melody, an ascending re
frain that laments the downward spiral of
a break-up. But a driving bass line and
lush harmonies soon fortify Blake's tenta
tive determination, and the song coasts
with pride and panache.
Ostensibly, the lyrics are about the dif
ficulty and self-doubt that accompany a
break-up, but one might also read a long
ing for the older, rougher Fanclub
sound: " Fake me back to what I know /
'Cause 1 don't know where to go / And
I'm finding it so hard to stay in tune."
It is as if the Fannie's marketer told
them to "be Travis, or die." I always
thought that the Fannies, in a pop

celebrity Deathmatch, would trounce
their young Glaswegian counterparts,
but legions of Travis fans — and their
spending money — might beg to differ.
When fun, rambunctious songs like
"Alcoholiday" (from 1997's "Bandwag

onesque") give way to the earnestness of
songs like "I Need Direction," the trans
formation may be complete. Teenage
Fanclub is Travis, and it may kill them
anyway. I suppose there are worse ways
to die.


Potential groupies, inquire within.
