# One infectious, badass 'Mof(r)o'
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
Like a first love, Mofro's delicious debut
record, "Blackwater," stays with you long after
you stop listening. Songwriter John J.J. Grey
combines blues, funk, rock and roll, gospel
and everything good in creating a sound so ir
resistible that even the most music-sawy can
not help but show respect!
Hailing from the Blackwater region of
North Florida, this band is equal parts Stevie
Wonder, Rolling Stones and James Brown.
The record opens with the title track, a key
board-heavy, seven-minute-plus ride that in
troduces the rest of the album, orienting lis-

teners to the swamp. Like
most of what follows, this first
song combines groove and
politics as Grey warns listen
ers about the depleting Flori
da wetlands. This song is so
slippery that lube has found a
new rival.

Though the record features a full band
complete with slide guitar, keyboards, har
monica, bass and drums, it retains a stripped
down, raw sound. The second track, "Ho
Cake," is the most crowded as Grey adds a sax
ophone and multiple vocal tracks to the mix. A
bottom-heavy song, "Ho Cake" showcases
Mofro's rhythm section, stiff competition to
any 70s funk act. A song about traditional
southern cuisine, the track conveys a spirit ab
sent from so much of today's pop.
After the hyper "Ho Cake," the album re-

Blackwater
Fog City Records (W
i*. iHrtrtrfc

laxes with the third and, arguably, best song
on the record, "Air." Though slower, this song
maintains Mofro's trademark bass and key
board-led groove and sounds like what
Jamiroqaui might produce if the British band
moved to the deep South. With its three min
utes of pop perfection, "Air" will loosen neck
ties and buckle knees.
Grey's obvious love for his homeland is one
of the album's best qualities. The band mem
bers convey this love even in the liner notes as
they only include the lyrics to "Florida" —
"Florida I know you're out there hidin' from
me/you get harder and harder to find / Every
day she keeps slippin' away / Florida please

don't fade on me now."
Although Grey,
who sings and plays gui
tar and harmonica, and
Daryl Hence', guitar and
dobro player, grew up
together, Mofro didn't
materialize until 1998.

in addition to Grey and Hence, the band fea
tures Fabrice "Fabgrease" Quentin on bass,
Nathan Shepherd on the keyboard and saxo
phone and George Sluppick on drums.
This music "is about remembering, about
paying respect and about giving thanks,"
writes the band in the liner notes.
Originally released in May of 2001 on Fog
City records, "Blackwater" promises to im
press those who enjoy arguing about Exile on
Main Street and Sticky Fingers as well those
who think the latter is simply what happens

after playing with honey.
Though the record stands up against any
other, it does have its downfalls, namely that it
is definitely retro. All those indie rockers who
have long since discarded their classic rock
records should stay away.
For the rest of you, these melodies and bass

lines will, like your high school sweetheart, stay
on your mind well after you've pledged love to
your college mate.
Mofro will play the Boom Boom Room on
Friday, Feb. 22, and Saturday, Feb. 23, locat
ed at 1601 Fillmore Avenue at Geary Street iu
San Francisco.
