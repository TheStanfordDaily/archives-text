# Get funky with this synth-bomb
## 
### NICK TORREY 
The marriage of stuttering, wankerish beats to too
pretty synths is the defining cliche of the electronic music
genre, generally called I DM by the stuttering, wankerish
boys who like it. The German duo Funkstorung (Chris

De Luca and Michael Fakesch) embody this genre. They
have done so since they abandoned their early career
making really good minimalist techno for Acid Planet,
started their own label, Musik Aus Strom and started
making really good IDM. (Okay — IDM stands for "in
telligent dance music," which admittedly is pretty terri-

ble as names go, but
it's way better than the
only real alternative,
"electronica.")
Their music
lent gigarhythmic
complexity to the
weirdly sentimental
sound of the genre,
the.paradox being that
although their drum
programming could
get so complicated that
no two measures were
alike, the songs all sort
of sounded the same.
After a bunch
of small releases,
Funkstorung made it
big with its first remix
album, "Additional
Productions," which
featured treatments of
famous people like
Bjork and the Wu-
Tang Clan. Now it has
released its second
remix album, "Vice
Versa."

In a year in which
fellow IDM deities
Autechre and the
Aphex Twin put out
albums that basically
took them further
down paths they've
been charting fora

while now, "Vice Versa" is interesting because it marks a
radical shift in Funkstorung's sound. Unfortunately, that
shift may not be for the better: the new music is smoother
and sexier, but it's also less complex and sometimes even
boring, which, when you think about it, isn't very sexy at
all. Still, some of it is brilliant, in ways both familiar and
excitingly new.
Also, it's not all remixes — two of the best tracks are
actually collaborations. "Salt" features my favorite MC,
Beans of the Antipop Consortium, spitting his almost
sung rhymes over echoey, glacial beats that just barely
skitter into nervous double-time.
The collaboration with Jay-Jay Johanson sounds like
syrupy '80s Britpop fused with furiky drum breaks; Jo
hanson tnelancholically croons "I want some fun" before
the track erupts into Funkstorung's signature time
stretched polyt hythms at the end. My favorite part of the
song is the way subtle flashes of club sneak their way in: a
bit of organ, a touch of delay on the drums and vocals.
Actually, musical nods to dub are what unite a lot of
the remixes, and that's the best part of Funkstorung's
new sound-they should do more with it. As it is, remixes
that should be totally great — particularly the tracks
from Plaid and Funckarma — are too simple, though the
Funckarma remix's pitchbent prettiness is hard to deny.


Play that funky music, white boy
The other remixes really are all over the
map, so I'll go ahead and list them: there's
Norse jazz weirdo Nils Petter Molvaer, A
Guy Called Gerald, Speedy J, the Notvvist,
Phillip Boa and the Voodooclub, Tocotron
ic and Jean Michel Jarre.
But the best remix by far is of old-school
New York hip-hop artists Ike Yard — it's
by no means the most radical departure
from Funkstorung's earlier sound, but
that doesn't matter in the slightest when
you're getting hit with the most massive
electro-funk synth bomb that anyone's
ever heard.
