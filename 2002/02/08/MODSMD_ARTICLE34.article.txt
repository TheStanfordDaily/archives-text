# 'Lobster' gets smurfed
## 
### S.E. LOCKWOOD 
Well, the band was fantastic.
The San Francisco-based sketch
comedy group Killing My Lobster's
trademark slogan is "Funny Can
Mean Different Tilings to Different
People." Boy, howdy. Did I mention
that the band was really good?

I've been a fan of KML for some time, dating back to the
first time I saw their short film" Rezelscheft" (watch it on their
website www.killingmylobster.com). I've enjoyed previous
stage shows as well, and that's why it pains me to say that this
particular show was not up to Lobster-par.
The Brava Theater Center is significantly larger than
their previous venues, and 1 must admit that there was a de
cent amount of laughter from the audience. But the skits for
this first show of their fifth season just weren't as funny as
they could have been.
It seems that the key to sketch comedy is knowing when
to get in and when to get out. Saturday Night Live's biggest
transgression is staying with a skit past the point of funny. In
this show, KML commits the opposite sin — they begin their
skits, then abandoned them while they were barely wriggling
out of their embryonic stage.
The overarching theme of "Cuilty As Sin" is a '40s
style tongue-in-cheek detective romp. The uninspired
skits included a recurring time-traveling mugger (I con
fess 1 didn't realize the time-travel aspect until after the
show), a slightly amusing 'NSync / Backstreet-type open
ing dance number, a tiring Witness Protection Program
bit and a "Lord of the Rings" spoof.
As with most sketch comedy shows, there were a cou
ple of well-written and performed skits. The most mem-

orable is definitely the
Smurf routine, in which
three characters act out a
police interview, but
throughout the dialogue
strategic nouns, verbs and
adjectives are replaced
with the appropriate con-

jugation of the word "Smurf."
"You might be interested to Smurf
that we found traces of Smurf inside her.
If we Smurf a I)NA Smurf, is that gonna
match your Smurf?"
I won't divulge the culmination of this
skit — you'll have to go see the show.
Also funny from start to finish was the
Learning Annex Last Rites in which a
priest is trying to school two inept stu
dents in the more sensitive aspects of
. . . fatherhood. This skit comes late in
the show, which is unfortunate because
this is when, all four performers have fi
nally found their comic footing.

The best writing of the evening was the District At
torney-Defense Attorney skit in which two lawyers
arrange a date while deciding the sentence of a guilty
client. I'm not doing it justice, but both writing and act
ing were spot-on.
This show also included a couple of running jokes.
One is a voice-over parody of the opening to "Law &
Order," which creates an entertaining interlude between
skits. Another is the previously mentioned time-traveling
bandit, which finally manages a funny moment when the
mugger tries to hold up two stoned aliens.

I saw the show on opening night, and there were a
couple of technical problems — the computer crashed, a
couple of lines were flubbed — but I think overall this
time KML just didn't push the envelope. The perfor
mance unfortunately included a fog machine that may
have given me a respiratory tract infection. Don't sit in
the front row.

& Hampshire), San Francisco.


One big, happy family
