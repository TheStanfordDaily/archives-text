# 'Mothman' hokey, but tolerable

### MARK ROBBINS 
It should come as no surprise that
"The Mothman Prophecies" has its hokey
moments. Richard Gere, as star Washing
ton Post reporter John Klein, wears a de

fiant, pursed-lipped pout for the better
part of the film as if a glass of ice water has
just been poured on his dome. But even
those who grow weary of the.devout self
worshipper should give this sieepy
thriller a chance.

Director Mark Pellington ("Arlington
Road") leads us into the shadows of the
unexplained and emerges with a stylish
new take on terror. "Prophecies" proves
the most ominous journey is subjective —
a sleepwalk between hypersensitive con
sciousness and murky nightmare.
"The Mothman Prophecies" is loosely
based on John Keel's personal account of
supernatural phenomena at Point Pleas
ant, W. VA., leading up to the Ohio River
Bridge disaster in December 1967. For

hundreds of years, al
leged sightings of large
moth-like figures have
preceded events like the
1985 Mexico earthquake
as well as the Chernobyl
nuclear accident in 1986.
The story begins "with

blissful married couple, John and Mary
("Will and Grace's" Debra Messing), pur
chasing a gorgeous new home. Mary
gazes at John on the ride home and oozes,
it's like "a dream come true." Suddenly
Mary catches a glimpse of something and
veers off the road. Hospitalized after the
crash, Mary is alive but not herself. She
asks John in a horror-stricken whisper,
"You didn't see it, did you?"
Mary's condition deteriorates until her
death. John is lost, traumatized by the
heartbreaking misfortune and perturbed
by the bizarre sketches of a dark being
found at his wife's bedside. On a late
night drive to an assignment in Rich-

mond, his car breaks down. John can't
seem to grasp how, in just a few hours, he
lias traveled four hundred miles off
course to the remote Point Pleasant, W.
Va. Sgt. Connie Parker (Laura Linney) re
veals to John that reports of strange en
counters and inexplicable occurrences
have surged recently in Point Pleasant.
Intrigued, John opens a personal investi
gation and soon someone or thing is try
ing to get his attention.
Gere's silvery-gray hair and ashen face

are at home in the film's
muted, ghostly aesthet
ic, and his performance
is several notches above
tolerable. Laura Lin
ney, who played oppo
site Gere in the court
room suspense "Primal

Fear," is a grounded and satisfying Sgt.
Parker and Will Patton unravels artfully
as the harried Gordon Smallwood. (Fora
classic Patton self-destruction, see "No
Way Out").
Determined not to let "Mothman" sink
into creature swill, Pellington is at his best
when his spook is simple — mysterious
phone calls, peculiar drawings and mid
night knocks on the door. He loses his
grip when the horror shifts from surreal
to tangible and appears to part with his re
straint. Though the film ultimately disap
points with an appallingly overdramatic
climax, "The Mothman Prophecies" defi
nitely has its merits.
