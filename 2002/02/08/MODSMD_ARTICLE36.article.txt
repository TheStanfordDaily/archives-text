# 'Muse' takes flight at Cantor
## 
### JENNIE KIM 
When Yvonne Jacquette, a respected 39-
year-old realist painter, flew to San Diego in
1 973 with her young son to visit her parents,
she began to sketch (lie clouds that she saw
out of her jet window. She did not expect to
receive far more inspiration from the
ground below. Jacquette recalls, "The
clouds rolled away, and there's that land
scape, and it was terrifying. I thought, 'Oh,
that'll take a lifetime, don't even start!' And
five minutes later I started, and I'm still
going."
What she had "started" was a method of
interpreting landscapes, countrysides and
cityscapes from a sky-high view that has
since earned her the moniker "Aerial
Muse."
This unique perspective is what granted
Jacquette much of her recognition. Some of
her achievements include solo exhibitions at
the St. Louis Art Museum and the DC
Moore Gallery. She has won an Artist Award
for Pastel from American Artist Magazine,
an Andrew Carnegie Prize for Painting and
the Mikhail Shatalov Prize for Printmaking
from the National Academy of Design Mu
seum. A diverse selection of her work from
the last 30 years opened for public viewing
last week at the Cantor Arts Center. Entitled
"Aerial Muse: The Art of Yvonne
Jacquette," the exhibit will run until April
21,2002. ~
The pieces range from strikingly intense
views drawn with charcoals, pastels, inks
and woodblock prints to expressive oil-on
canvas paintings. For such a varied body of
work, it is hard to believe that Jacquette un
dergoes the same basic routine for each
piece.
"It's kind of a standard thing," she said.
"I go either in an airplane or in a high-rise
with pastels to start. If I think it's going to be
a night view, I take a dark piece of paper to
start on, if I think it's going to be a daytime
view I take a light piece of paper. So the first
[draft] is worked out quite well with pastel.
Back in the studio I fool around with it a
great deal until I feel it's got something
pulling it together. And then 1 decide from

there whether that looks like something that
would work well as a print, or whether it
would work well as a large painting, or
whether it's terrible and throw it out."
Jacquette's subject matter masterfully
complements her medium. Her "Aerial
View of 33rd Street" (1981) at night is cap
tured only with black pastel on vellum
backed with board. According to the artist,
this translucent drawing surface was delib
erately selected because "it gave it a light
that was almost radioactive. Someone called
it 'Darth Vader light.' It changed the quali
ty".
Similarly, her series of composite wood
cuts (1997), inked in black with occasional
touches of royal blue, intricately narrate the
nightlife of Manhattan with a graphic hon
esty that is reminiscent of black-on-white
screen prints. The depth that Jacquette is
able to achieve using such a limited palette
is astonishing.
Manhattan is a favorite locale of
Jacquette's. She began working in a New
York City loft on West 29th Street in 1975
and occasionally still works there. Her
painting "Mixed Heights and Harbor from
World Trade Center II"and many other
works were done from various high-rises in
Manhattan, including several of the World
Trade Center buildings.
.The events of Sept. 11 left Jacquette feel
ing "very distraught." She elaborated, "I
was going there for 25 years on and off. . .
There may be a lot more ramifications from
that that 1 can't tell yet."
In sharp contrast to the hustle and bus
tle of her cityscapes, Jacquette also depicts
serene bird's-eye views of the countryside
in her oil-on-canvas painting of the land
surrounding the Passagassawaukeag River
in Maine. Using a palette of colors that are
vivid but natural, Jacquette painted "Pas
sagassawaukeag I" (1975) with short
brushstrokes and a literal interpretation of
the landscape.
When asked about selecting different
modes of representation of her view,
Jacquette responded, "Sometimes I play
around with .a subjective view, and other
times I'm just being very literal, as much as

I can be. I'm trying to be very honest about
it, taking what's really there and then trying
to transform it into some kind of feeling that
has something special about it."
Her mixing of both a subjective and a lit
eral view results in her most interesting and
successful pieces. The massive (80 inch x 80
inch), three-part, "Times Square Triptych
II" (1986-87) embodies the whirling chaos
of the streets of New York on a busy night.
Billboards painted with an exaggeratedly
bold, streaky hand illuminate the skyline
with bright, blaring color while taxicabs and
tourists occupy the streets below.
Another dynamic painting, "Shinjuku
Pleasure District, Tokyo II" (1995), was in
spired by Jacquette's work with cameras.
Citing Hong Kong as one of her most mem
orable visits, she began filming her aerial
views for "Night Fantasies" there, a film she
made with her husband of 37 years, pho
tographer Rudy Burckhardt.
While taping the gaudily-lit streets of
Hong Kong one night, Jacquette made an

important realization: "I was looking
through the camera where you have to close
down the amount of light, so I'd only see the
bright things ... it made me see what I
could leave out," she remembers. "And
once I had a sense of what I could leave out,
I thought, '1 don't even have to have them
[the signs] standing up, especially since so
many of them were neon signs. I could turn
them around, float them, take a sign from
another view. I started compositing a great
deal at that point, and that led me to ["Shin
juku Pleasure District, Tokyo II"]."
Jacquette's art has only been enhanced
by such chance discoveries. The decades
since that first influential flight have pro
duced various types of work that range from
representational to abstract, but always re
maining visionary and uniquely evocative.
Her exhibition is a comprehensive collec
tion of locations, viewpoints and experi
ences that will change the way you see the
world below when you next peer out of the
window of an airplane.


Featuring pieces like 'Times Square Triptych II,"the exhibit, at the Cantor Arts Center, tracks Yvonne Jacquette's nearly-30-year career


"And five minutes later I started, and I'm still going."
