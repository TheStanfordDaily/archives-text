# Ready for touchy-feely cock 'Rock'?

### STEPHEN VIGIL 
Simply because they hate his guts as a
matter of principle, most people will not give
Kid Rock the time of day. Writing a review
about "the Rock" is almost like reviewing a
controversial indie movie — people either
love it or they hate it.
Kid Rock presents a dilemma in this way
because popular opinion of him is very
much based upon the image he presents to
us on MTV.

His new album, the
aptly titled "Cocky" is
Rock's first studio effort
since 1998's multiplat
inum release "Devil With
out A Cause."
True to form, Rock's

album has its fair share of cock rock, as well
as plenty of self-glorification. Rock, a Detroit
native, has fancied himself a cowboy before
and on "Cocky" he continues that fantasy on
songs with titles like "Trucker Anthem,"
though the last time I checked, Detroit is not
in the South. Despite his bravado, though,
the fact is that Rock has produced a decent,
solid release.
In a way it seems that Rock has navigated
the business of music quite well. He markets
himself as a badass rap-rocker — the 21st
century poster boy for sex, drugs and rock
'n' roll — notorious for pimpin' hos and
"partying like a beast" (thanks, Tommy Lee),

Kid Rock
Lava/Atlantic (W 5^

while still experimenting with various stvles
of music and growing as a musician.
In this sense, to truly analyze Kid Rock's
music you have to forget his whole image —
the hideous costumes, excessive profanity
and dancing strippers. On his first studio re
lease, "Devil Without a Cause," for example,
he surprised the public with the soulful bal
lad "Only God Knows Why."
On "Cocky," he takes that emotional sen
sitivity even further. One could almost say
that, with the exception of the obligatory

I o /
cock rock numbers, the album
might pass fora country/blues
crossover album.
Perhaps Kid Rock isn't as
tough as he projects himself. It
seems that he wants to be a
country and blues musician

but, like many a rockstar, can't quite commit
to that.
His love for Southern rock is evident
throughout. He plays the opening riff from
Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird" in "You
Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me."
On "Picture," he shows his affection for
country music. The song, featuring Sheryl
Crow, is perhaps the gem of the album. It is
a gut-wrenching elegy about love, betrayal
and denial, delivered in a neo-traditional
country style.
Rock has certainly grown as a musician.
"Cocky" incorporates piano, vocal har
monies, keyboards, acoustic guitar, steel gui

tar and even harp and banjo.
"Lonely Road of Faith" is perhaps the best
example of this. In the tradition of Lynyrd
Skynyrd, it is a heartfelt, sophisticated and
evocative tribute to his deceased friend,

midget MC, Joe C.
Kid Rock shows his humanity on this lat
est release. Though he likely won't stop
grabbing his crotch at his concerts, he's cer
tainly no buffoon either.


Suck on deez, Pam-Pam
