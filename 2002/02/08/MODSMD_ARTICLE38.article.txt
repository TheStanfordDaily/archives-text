# Cracker's latest a bit stale
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
"Cracker Forever," the band announces on its
newest disc and, while not timeless, it is true that the
band has outlasted most ot its "alternative rock" peers.

Lead singer / songwriter David Lowery's first band,
Camper Van Beethoven, was an excellent, influential
and critically acclaimed '80s underground band.
However, it took the alternative revolution and the
formation of Cracker in the early '90s (with guitarist /

songwriter Johnny Hickman) to get him
hits. Cracker infused more rock and
drained some ofthe eclecticism of Camper
Van Beethoven, hitting the big time.
The band's self-titled album featured
"Teen Angst (What the World Needs
Now)," "Kerosene Hat" and the alterna
tive radio staple "Low." While its early al
bums were thoroughly enjoyable, subse
quent releases had neither their commer
cial nor their artistic appeal. Virgin
packed up their better tracks onto the
compilation "Garage D'Or" and packed
up the band too — it is now on Back Porch
Records in association with Virgin.
"Forever" isn't exactly the band's tri
umphant return, but it's certainly not a
failure either. Returning to Cracker's
music after all these years is quite fun.
Their quirky sense of humor and solid
musicianship make the disc a worthwhile
listen. For one thing, it is more musically
cohesive than anything they've done since
their debut. Yet there's no true standout
track, and what's there isn't outstanding.
Two tracks are more prominent than
the others. "Guarded By Monkeys" is an
absurd, hypnotic track with the strange
chorus, "You are so beautiful / You
should be guarded by monkeys / You are

so beautiful." Its musi
cal and lyrical themes
are repeated through
out the disc.
The second stand
out is "What You're
Missing," an extended

Cracker
Virgin/Back Porch (Jg
irtrtrCrt? -

pseudo-rap track that is reminiscent of Barenaked
Ladies' live raps in its deft, but silly lyrics. It is unex
pected and unlike anything else on the record, making
it a good way to end the album.
The other tracks are consistently good throughout
the album,something that can't be said of Cracker's
most successful disc, "Kerosene Hat," Lyrically, the
band is in good form, as on the barbed "Don't Bring Us
Down": "You live a charmed life but nothing seems
right to you / Roses and wine, thorns and vinegar/
Your only delight is others' demise / So take your sorry
ass back to Florida."
Echoes of classical and roots rock can be heard
throughout, but the record is mostly straight-ahead
"Cracker Soul" as they dub their laid-back form of rock.
This may be a bit disappointing, but it works.
Mark Linkous appears as co-producer and guest
singer. He is the lead singer / songwriter of Sparkle
horse, another critically acclaimed band with many mu
sical similarities to Cracker. Keyboardist Kenny Margo
lis, drummer Frank Funaro and new bassist Brandy
Wood also pitch in. However, it's obvious that Lowery
and Hickman are holding the reins on this horse.
In the current environment, this disc — with its sim
ilarity to previous Cracker albums — is unlikely to win
the band any new fans. But who knows? Camper Van
Beethoven was never commercially viable, and Low
ery's still here, making music after all these years.
