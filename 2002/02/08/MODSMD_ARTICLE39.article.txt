# Group proud of Southern 'Roots'
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
The title of the Nappy Roots' major label debut, "Water
melon, Chicken and Gritz," couldn't be a better reflection of
the group's roots. These six guys, who originally started

rhyming together at Western Kentucky
University in 1995, are all about the im
portant things in life.
And we're not talking about hos, ice
and flashy cars. This is quality music —
imagine Outkast in Kentucky, only there
are six of them.
Nappy Roots is primed to carve its niche

in the hip-hop world when its album drops in late February.
Perhaps you've been lucky enough to hear its first single
"Awnaw," which has been getting a good dose of under
ground radio play. With its skills, the group is certainly de
serving of more attention.
The album starts off with a bang — "Hustla" is a con
coction of sweet rhyming and musical minimalism with a
good pop hook thrown in. There's not a single bad song on

the record, but the standouts are "Ballin' On a Budget"and
"Po' Folks."
Reading those tides, you might jump to conclusions. Defi
nitely don't dismiss Nappy Roots as some sort of country trash
rap though. What they offer instead is a candid kxik at life is-

sues that, while rooted in their native Ken
tucky experience, are universal.
Take for example," Peanuts,"a chronicle of
the group's ongoing struggles, with the lines,
"Ain't about thuggin' / It ain't about hustlin' /
It's about seeing your kids go without strug
glin'." There are no self aggrandizing ego-ex
ploding rhymes here. Nappy Roots has a

more important agenda — to make you think, while still
showing you a good time.
In a quote included with the CD's press kit, two of the
group's members comment rather seriously on the band's
responsibility to make a good name for their "often over
looked hometurf." Their effort to remain faithful to where
they're from is not a particularly new concept in the hip-hop
world, but the words which they use are eloquent. "It's like

a plant. If there's no light to shine on Kentucky, it won't grow
... We do have a burden on our shoulders, because a lot is
riding on [our] success ... But we're not worried. Our music
speaks for itself."
With "Watermelon, Chicken and Gritz," they're sure to
make their hometurf proud indeed.
