# Subcontracting group assesses its campaign
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Coalition Against Subcon
tracting held a town hall meeting last
night to discuss the state of its cam
paign against subcontracting, which
gained public attention last Novem
ber when six students were arrested
during a rally.
The approximately 50 people who
attended consisted primarily of un
dergraduate members of the Stanford
Labor Action Committee, Stanford
Committee for Peace and Justice and
MECIiA, a Chicano / Latino student
group, but also of several graduate law
students, faculty members, president
of United Stanford Workers Zev
kvitky and other undergraduates.
They gathered in the Asian American
Activities Center to discuss the pur
pose of the group's campaign and de
termine actions that students need to
take to further its progress.
Students have been working for
several months to keep the Stanford
Hospital from subcontracting workers

and have also moved for the Universi
ty to pay all its workers a living wage.
The issue came to a head at the end of
lasi quarter when student activism in
tensified, resulting in rallies and meet
ings with administrators. In Decem
ber, the Hospital amended worker
contracts to include health benefits
and raise wages from $8.50 an hour to
$10.10 an hour, said coalition leaders.
Organizers said that, in addition to
informing students on events since No
vember's arrests, the meeting was a way
to assess their standing at Stanford.
"Part of the purpose is to gauge
campus support at this meeting," said
junior Angad Blialla, a SI AC mem
ber. " There will definitely be some ac
tions coming up in the future and we
want to *see if people are willing to
come out."
I he meeting began with junior
Meghana Reddy, SLAC co-coordina
tor, reviewing the meaning of the
terms "subcontracting," "directly
hired" and "living wage."

David Walkowitz, visiting professor of history from New York University, brings up
a concern at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
She also announced President
John Hennessy's recent commit
ment to a living wage
"Most notably, in a meeting
with President Hennessy and
other top administrators on Jan
uary 18, Stanford made a verbal
commitment to instituting a liv
ing wage for all directly and indi
rectly hired workers by the end of
the academic year," a campaign
update distributed to all atten
dees said.
Finally, explained the
negative impact that instituting
only a living wage can have on
workers, as it can end up encour
aging subcontracting.
"This ends up becoming a wage
ceiling instead of bringing every
body up," she said. "Instead of a
living wage, we're proposing a pre
vailing wage," which would call for
all workers in a given vocation to
be paid what the highest-paid
workers make.
She also identified the final
goal of the campaign.as not just

raising wages, but also as increas
ing education, protecting lights
to organize and easing trans
portation issues.
"Just to clarity, this is not a living
wage campaign, so don't go
spreading rumors," Reddy told
the attendees. "And it's not just a
prevailing wage campaign; it's a
'Code of Conduct' campaign."
" There's a lot to still fight about
and they're going to give lisa fight
about this," she said. "But we've
seen that they absolutely respond,
to action."
Sophomore Leti Ramirez, co
chair of MEChA, then recapped
the movement's history over the
last several months.
Rhalla then described the cam
paign plan and told the group
what (hey individually needed to
do to help tht* movement.
Emphasizing that this was in
essence the beginning of a new
campaign, he called upon people
to attend actions and to mobilize
their respective groups.
"We need to have turnouts at
rallies of hundreds and more," he
told the crowd. "We're urging you
to take responsibility for mobiliz
ing a group or community you feel

connected to."
He also stressed that the move
ment is currently at a critical
point, necessitating a sustained ef
fort to stay on administrators'
radar screens.
"They've given us an opportu
nity and the only way we're going
to get anything from the Universi
ty is from direct pressure," Bhalla
said. "We need to bring pressure
like they've never felt if we're going
to do anything."
1 he group then discussed its
next major action, which will take
place 011 April 4, the National Stu
dent Labor Day of Action.
Also, beginning on Monday the
Coalition will be seeking support
from organizations fora petition
to Hennessy.
The group leaders said that
there would be other actions be
tween now and April 4, but that
they were not yet public.
"We're not trying to give Hen
nessy two months' notice about
when we're going to strike," one
member told the group.
Ramirez said she was pleased
with the turnout.
"There were a lot of new faces, a
lot of new grad students," she said.

"But we also leel like there's a lot of
people who don't really under
stand the issue."
SLAC members said they felt
they had a large body of support
on campus. Sophomore Amanda
Cassel, a member of SLAC and
SCIPJ, cited the turnout of 250 stu
dents at a meeting during dead
week in December and said,
" 1 hat's the pinnacle of support."
In terms of administrative treat
ment of the issue, SLAC and
MKChA leaders both said that the
fact that they have been able to
meet with University leaders
demonstrates some progress.
"At least we're talking to Hen
nessy,' Ramirez said.
Despite recent victories,
though, some leaders still felt that
the coalition and administrators
were not necessarily on the same
page, especially on the issue of
what the living wage will ultimate
ly be and whether the University
will embrace a code of conduct.
"They're pulling all these eco
nomic arguments these days that
don't really make sense," said
Bhalla. "It's obvious from the
meetings that [at some level] we're
not talking about the same thing."
