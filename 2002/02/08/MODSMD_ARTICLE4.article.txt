# Subcontracting group assesses its campaign
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Coalition Against Subcon
tracting held a town hall meeting last
night to discuss the state of its cam
paign against subcontracting, which
gained public attention last Novem
ber when six students were arrested
during a rally.
The approximately 50 people who
attended consisted primarily of un
dergraduate members of the Stanford
Labor Action Committee, Stanford
Committee for Peace and Justice and
MECIiA, a Chicano / Latino student
group, but also of several graduate law
students, faculty members, president
of United Stanford Workers Zev
kvitky and other undergraduates.
They gathered in the Asian American
Activities Center to discuss the pur
pose of the group's campaign and de
termine actions that students need to
take to further its progress.
Students have been working for
several months to keep the Stanford
Hospital from subcontracting workers

and have also moved for the Universi
ty to pay all its workers a living wage.
The issue came to a head at the end of
lasi quarter when student activism in
tensified, resulting in rallies and meet
ings with administrators. In Decem
ber, the Hospital amended worker
contracts to include health benefits
and raise wages from $8.50 an hour to
$10.10 an hour, said coalition leaders.
Organizers said that, in addition to
informing students on events since No
vember's arrests, the meeting was a way
to assess their standing at Stanford.
"Part of the purpose is to gauge
campus support at this meeting," said
junior Angad Blialla, a SI AC mem
ber. " There will definitely be some ac
tions coming up in the future and we
want to *see if people are willing to
come out."
I he meeting began with junior
Meghana Reddy, SLAC co-coordina
tor, reviewing the meaning of the
terms "subcontracting," "directly
hired" and "living wage."
