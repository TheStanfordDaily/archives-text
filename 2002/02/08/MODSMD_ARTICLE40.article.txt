# Band bends the laws of punk
## 
### JUNG LAH 
Unwritten Law formed in the early '90s, when it was an
unassuming pop punk band from San Diego that would
play smalUvenue shows with other unassuming San Diego
pop punk bands like Blink-182. And much like Blink, their
now-MTV-behemoth citymates, Unwritten Law's sound
over the years has turned into something much less punk
rock and much more commercial-radio friendly, which has
some plusses (catchiness galore) and many minuses (pre
dictability).

Nevertheless,
the band's fourth full
length release, "Elva,"
which is its second
record on the major
label Interscope, is not
watered-down to the

point of unlistenability. In fact, many of the songs are solid
and well-written. But many others fall dangerously close
to somewhere between uninspired power pop and
sounds-from-a-LIVE-105-playlist. This, in the end, sim-

ply does not compare to its older, at
titude-driven anthems.
Hardly the skate-punk band
they were back in the mid-'9os, Un
written Law's new material is much
slower then it used to be, while the
lyrics seem to lack the depth of the
songs from its last, self-titled record
released back in 1998. However, lead
singer Scott Russo's smooth, melodic
harmonies and the tweaked hooks
and riffs of guitarists Steve Morris
and Wade Youman remain engag
ing, albeit slightly overproduced.
The record begins with the
bizarre "Mean Girl," whose driving
rock chorus "I'm in love with a mean
girl" is offset by the synth-heavy, pul
sating crunch of the syncopated verses.
But the next track, "Up All
Night," has "single" written all over it
— a song fueled by its own energetic
mood, finding said energy in the finer
points of getting stoned and doing
nothing for hours on end, watching the
sun come up. "What's wrong with kick-

ing it when you're bored and lit?" Russo asks us, to which one
invariably feels the urge to answer, "Absolutely nothing."
"Sound Siren" is the typical upbeat melodic number
about girls, where the band boasts, "We'll write the one that
makes her come." Other songs seem to be some strange hy
brid of 10-fi, Beatles pop and reggae, like the acoustic / elec
tric guitar blend of "How You Feel." Its mood shifts from bal
lad-y to anthemic during the bridge when the usual angst
filled emoting occurs ("I'm frustrated, so frustrated, seems
like I've been here before").
Lyrics that ring this familiar have a tendency to annoy, but
dial's not what's going on here - rather, like much of "Elva"
as a whole, the familiarity blends with the musical variety to
allow for some sort of strange rebirth for Unwritten I .aw as
"the band formerly known as punk."
"Elva's" exploration of style extends further: to rockabilly
("Blame It On Me"), indie rock ("Rest Of My Life") and we
love-Sublime. In an undeniably cool homage to the 1994 clas
sic "Robbin' the Hood," Unwritten Law has dug up some of
the old tapes used on the Sublime album of crazy-man
Raleigh screaming random obscenities and general non
sense, and has included them on "Elva" by continuing where
"Robbin"' left off. "Raleigh Soliloquy" parts five and six offer
such pearls of Raleigh-wisdom as "Don't flick with me, I'm a
yoga!" Awesome.
Some might see "Elva" 's diverse stylistic approach as an
"evolution" away from three-chord punk rock. But their last
album also featured explorations away from the typical
Southern California punk fare while at the same time main
taining a certain edge of hard-and-fast, confrontational pas
sion-something almost expected from a band who calls them
selves punk.
I miss that element of hyper-intensity in "Elva," but maybe
that just has something to do with my fond memories of going
to Unwritten Law shows in high school, when they sounded
significantly different. "Elva" isn't a bad record, but it isn't a
great one either. Listen at your own discretion.

bizarre "Mean Girl," whose driving
rock chorus "I'm in love with a mean
girl" is offset by the synth-heavy, pul
sating crunch of the syncopated verses.
But the next track, "Up All
Night," has "single" written all over it
— a song fueled by its own energetic
mood, finding said energy in the finer
points of getting stoned and doing
nothing for hours on end, watching the
sun come up. "What's wrong with kick-

ing it when you're bored and lit?" Russo asks us, to which one
invariably feels the urge to answer, "Absolutely nothing."
"Sound Siren" is the typical upbeat melodic number
about girls, where the band boasts, "We'll write the one that
makes her come." Other songs seem to be some strange hy
brid of 10-fi, Beatles pop and reggae, like the acoustic / elec
tric guitar blend of "How You Feel." Its mood shifts from bal
lad-y to anthemic during the bridge when the usual angst
filled emoting occurs ("I'm frustrated, so frustrated, seems
like I've been here before").
Lyrics that ring this familiar have a tendency to annoy, but
dial's not what's going on here - rather, like much of "Elva"
as a whole, the familiarity blends with the musical variety to
allow for some sort of strange rebirth for Unwritten I .aw as
"the band formerly known as punk."
"Elva's" exploration of style extends further: to rockabilly
("Blame It On Me"), indie rock ("Rest Of My Life") and we
love-Sublime. In an undeniably cool homage to the 1994 clas
sic "Robbin' the Hood," Unwritten Law has dug up some of
the old tapes used on the Sublime album of crazy-man
Raleigh screaming random obscenities and general non
sense, and has included them on "Elva" by continuing where
"Robbin"' left off. "Raleigh Soliloquy" parts five and six offer
such pearls of Raleigh-wisdom as "Don't flick with me, I'm a
yoga!" Awesome.
Some might see "Elva" 's diverse stylistic approach as an
"evolution" away from three-chord punk rock. But their last
album also featured explorations away from the typical
Southern California punk fare while at the same time main
taining a certain edge of hard-and-fast, confrontational pas
sion-something almost expected from a band who calls them
selves punk.
I miss that element of hyper-intensity in "Elva," but maybe
that just has something to do with my fond memories of going
to Unwritten Law shows in high school, when they sounded
significantly different. "Elva" isn't a bad record, but it isn't a
great one either. Listen at your own discretion.
