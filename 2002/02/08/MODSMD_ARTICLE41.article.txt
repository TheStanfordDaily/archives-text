# A
						successful 'Coup' at Slim's

### KAREEM GHANEM 
Boots Riley, frontman for the Oakland
hip-hop outfit The Coup, is a self-pro
claimed Marxist and his political senti
ments weave their way into nearly all of the
group's songs — from its obscure 1993
debut "Kill My Landlord" to 200 l's excel
lent "Party Music."
Perhaps, that's why it felt a bit weird to
have so much fun at a Coup concert. My
own experience with communism is limit-

Ed to reading "The Commu
nist Manifesto" in I HUM and
the cool hammer and sickle
T-shirt that my friend Kristin
brought back from the Stan
ford-in-Moscow program.
Playing a sold-out show at

Slim's this past Friday, The Coup present
ed the audience with a slick mix of politics
and funk-laced beats that made for an in
credible night.
About an hour after the two openers, a
rather corpulent man (who identified him
self as "Mike"), with a Heineken in one
hand and a joint in the other, began shov
ing my girlfriend and me with his swollen
belly in order to get a better view of the
much-anticipated headliners.
I whispered to another man next to me
that I could probably maul Mike with my

bare fists but that I didn't want to start a
scene. He just looked at me blankly, point
ing towards the stage at deejay Pam the
Funkstress who had appeared on stage
along with The Coup's drummer, bassist,
backup singer and keyboardist.
Focusing on their newest songs, the
group had the audience singing along on
angry political anthems like "Pork - and
Beef," "Ride The Fence" and "Get Up."
Riley dominated the evening with his
electric personality. Imagine Gumby in

black baggy pants with a
black "Oakland" t-shirt
shuffling back and forth on
stage and you get an idea of
what this guy looks like.
With an uneven Afro that
Hops around when he bobs

his head, this is a lyricist with a command
ing presence.
Addressing the crowd directly only
once, he offered a tender introduction to
the pro-feminist country-funk song "Wear
Clean Draws." Penned for Riley's young
daughter, the song is infectious with lyrics
like "Tell that boy he's wrong / Girls are
strong" and "When you play house pre
tend / Let the man clean up / You'll be too
busy with the other things you gotta do."
"Cars and Shoes," off of the 1998 full
length "Steal This Album" was one of many

songs that
gave the band
a chance to
touch on its
local fan base.
Filled with
gripes about
the East Bay's
AC Transit
and having
your car
break down
on the Bay
Bridge, it was
especially well
received by
the San Fran
cisco crowd.
That The
Coup could
put together
such a fun
show while
preserving

their social message was remarkable. I had
just one complaint the whole night —
about the merchandise on sale. Sweatshirts
for $50? Please!
I, for one, have never forgiven Rage
Against the Mac hine for charging fans $40
for concert tickets. "Zack l)e La Roc ha is a
communist," they say? Bullshit. Look, I

have no idea how much Marx charged peo
ple for "Das Kapital," but don't tell me that
The Coup was just trying to show the
hypocrisy of capitalism.
Still, though, 1 forgive Boots, I'ani and
the rest of the crew. I might not have
bought a sweatshirt, but the $17 ticket
price was certainly more than worth it.


Don't say a single word about this hair!
