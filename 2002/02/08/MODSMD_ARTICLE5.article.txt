# Giovacchini's clutch shots propel Cardinal to victory
## Senior guard hits three-pointer, free throw at crucial moments 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Too many times this season, Stanford
had lost down the stretch.
Too many times, it had been in the
same situation and fallen.
Therefore, one more defeat could
have put a permanent dent into the psy
che, the confidence, and the motivation
of every member of this team.
And it all came down to one shot.
One big, clutch, heart-stopping shot
— from the most unlikely of heroes.
Trailing 78-75, senior point guard
Tony Giovacchini hit a 3-pointer with
four seconds left to tie the game and
send it into overtime.

Thursday: No. 20 Stanford 90, No
13 Oregon 87, OT

Had Giovacchini missed that shot, his
only field goal of the game, the Cardinal
would have fallen 3 1/2 games back of
Oregon in the conference race, putting
even more pressure on the team to even
make the NCAA Tournament.
Instead, No. 20 Stanford (14-(i, 7-4
Pacific 10 Conference) pullecl out a 90-
87 overtime victory over No. 13 Oregon
(17-0, 9-3), in a game that featured 25
lead changes, and put the Cardinal just 1
1/2 games back and right in the middle
of t he race.
Trankly, it was a shot that everyone
will remember fora long time.,
"I don't think I've ever, taken a shot
like that, and for it to go in, that's big. It

was a really big high," said Cio
vacchini, who finished with five
assists, four rebounds and six
points in minutes of play.
"In that situation, you've got to
put up the best shot you can get.
I feel pretty comfortable catching
and shooting to my right."
()h\ ionsly. Ciovacchini wasn't
the primary option, as the Cardi
nal went to Casey Jacobsen first.
But since the Ducks double
teamed him, he had nowhere to
go except to Ciovacchini, who
was standing four feet outside
the arc.
Ciovacchini also hit three-ol
four free throws in the final 20
seconds of the extra session to
seal the victory.
A season's worth of frustration
— for the Cardinal and for Cio
vacchini — might have been re
linquished with that one shot.
"I'm very happy for him,"
Ducks coach Ernie Kent said. "I
know it's been a tough senior
year for that guy. That tells you
about his type of character and
courage for him to take that shot
and make it. My hat is off to him
for hitting it."
Nobody saw it on television,
but tliev should have. No radio

call would have given it justice.
"It's unfortunate that this
game wasn't a televised game,"
Ducks coach Ernie Kent said. "It
was an unbelievable atmos
phere. There was two heavy
weights going at it and they got
the ball last."
That one shot revitalized the
hopes of every Cardinal fan, and
it motivated every player on (lie
bench.
"After Tony made that shot,
everyone just got together and
said we're going to get this one,"
said junior center Curtis Bor
chardt, who tallied his ninth dou
ble-double of the season with 24
points and 1 5 rebounds.
They did. They played like a
team throughout the extra ses
sion and held on for the much
needed victory.
Jacobsen led the Cardinal
with 41 points, becoming only
the second player in Stanford
history to record two 40-point
games in one season since Hank
I.uisetti, in 1938.
Borchardt, who finished with
five blocks, lipped his season total
to 54, breaking the single-season
record, which had been 50, set in
the 1996-97 season by lim
Yoting.
Sophomore forward Joe kir
i holer stepped up big, playing 22
solid minutes and finishing with
nine points and nine rebounds.

kin holer's turn-around 10-foot
jumper gave the Cardinal an 80-
79 lead in the extra session.
It was the first time since the
1976-77 season that Stanford
had played overtime two games
in a row.
In the end, the C ardinal pre
vailed despite a career-high .H6
point performance by Frederick
Jones.
"lie was spectacular. Every
time they needed a clutch basket,
they got one," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery, who
has still never lost to Oregon at
Maples Pavilion (16-0). "Oregon
is an awfully good basketball
team. We could not stop them
from scoring.
"People got they money's
worth tonight — it was damn
good basketball game.
"It was a lough game, it's
pleasing to see lis step up late
and make the plays we needed to
make."
And a shot they needed to
make.
So when Stanford's players
and fans exited Maples Pavilion,
myriad thoughts and feelings
rang throughout their minds:
"Finally, a win down the
stretch. Finally, an overtime
win."
And then there was the loudest
thought of all:
" I hank you, loin."
