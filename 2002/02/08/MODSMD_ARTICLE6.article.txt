## Weekend gathering will showcase struggle for health and human rights 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR 
Amid an array of prominent world
events, a film festival beginning today at
Stanford's Braun Auditorium aims to
shed light on a subject matter that typi
cally does not appear in the mainstream
media in an area of the world that has
once again entered the spotlight.
"In Visible Crisis: Health and
Human Rights in the Middle East," is a
film festival sponsored in part by the
Stanford chapter of the Physicians for
Human Rights organization.
Running until Monday, it will con
sist of four of films and guest
speakers who will give their personal
insight on the conditions existing in
Iraq, Israel, the Palestinian territories,
Iran and Afghanistan.
"It is easy to be disconnected from
the world," said Feyza Marouf, a stu
dent at the School of Medicine and co
organizer of the event with fellow
medical student Mina Matin. "Physi

cians are in a rnique position to enact
global change."
"We have a responsibility lo address
human rights in the Middle Last in
light of the recent [world]*events,"
Matin said. "There are actual people
there with human faces . . . we
wouldn't be living up to the name of
the organization if we didn't address
the Middle East."
This is the group's first major event
since it became an official Stanford or
ganization at the beginning of this
school year.
Because of the group's relatively
short existence, funding has been lim
ited and hard to come by.
"On the first day we-had nothing,"
Matin said. "We had to petition for
funding from different sources, which
took a lot of dedication and work."
The festival's opening day will
consist of films focusing on Iraq, and
guest speaker Gloria La Riva will in
troduce her film, "Genocide by Sanc
tions." She will also discuss the work
of the International Action Center in
Iraq, a non-profit group seeking to
promote world peace through educa
tion and issue advocacy.
"Speakers were chosen based on

their personal experiences," said Dara
Ghahremani, a psychology graduate
student helping to coordinate the
event."The film festival format was
chosen to give a sense of reality to
everyday experiences."
Saturday will feature Dr. Jess Ghan
nam of the UG-San Francisco depart
ment of psychiatry and several films.
Organizers are spotlighting a film ti
tled, "You, Me, Jerusalem," the first
documentary about the city of
Jerusalem, which is co-directed by an
Israeli and a Palestinian.
"It really creates hope that a hu
manitarian unity can be achieved and
that disparate people can come to
gether over basic human needs,"
Marouf said. "Never has it been more
timely to re-examine the Israeli-Pales
tinian reality."
On Sunday, the festival will probe
human rights issues in Iran. Arezoo
Osanloo, a social anthropologist at the
University's Humanities Genter, will
"talk about human rights 112 rom the per
spective of everyday Iranians in Iran,"
Ghahremani said.
