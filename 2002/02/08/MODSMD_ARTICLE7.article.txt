# Sig Ep hopes to find good men for scholarship

### RAVNEET KAUR 
Sigma Phi Kpsilon hopes to continue the tradion
of its Balanced Man Scholarship after the success of
last year's scholarship.
"Our goal is very simple â€” we're giving some
thing back to our community while at the same time
reinforcing values,that we believe in, and believe that
all men on campus should strive towards," said fra
ternity member Gaurav Keerthi.
The Balanced Man Scholarship is designed to rec
ognize the freshman males at Stanford who most
closely embody the ideal of the "balanced man."
"A balanced man comes in every shape, size and
color. It's someone who has a healthy mind, a healthy
body and is active in his community," Keerthi said.
He clarified that the fraternity is not looking for
perfection in its selection of a recipient.
"We don't have unrealistic expectations either,"
Keerthi said. "This isn't a cutthroat competition to
see who's got the highest [grade
point average] and plays the
most sports."
Keerthi explained that the bal
anced man is defined by a high
level of activity.
"[The balanced man] is the
kind of guy you would love to get
to know, someone who works
hard, plays hard, and is takes an
active role in his community, be it
the dorm, his extra-curricular ac
tivities, or outside school," he said.
According to Keerthi, last year
was the first time Stanford's Sig
Ep Chapter decided to present
the scholarship.
"Nationally, Sigma Phi Epsilon
Fraternity has given out this
award fora longtime, and we only
recently decided to adopt it after
careful study," he said.
Interest or intent to join the fra
ternity is not a requirement to win
the scholarship.
"[ The scholarship is ] a method
that goes far beyond just commu
nicating our name, but communi
cates the kinds of values that we
believe in, something that we be

lieve we are unique in so doing,"
Keerthi said.
"This scholarship is in no way a
recruiting tool, and there are defi
nitely many males out there who
apply for the scholarship with ab
solutely no intention of joining Sig
Ep, or even rushing any fraternity
at all."
Sig Ep president Nelson Fong
explained that the scholarship is
one among several of the fraterni
ty's philanthropic events.
"Although the [scholarship] is
designed to recogni/e and benefit
one individual, during fall and
spring quarters Sigma Phi Epsilon
tries to give back to the communi
ty as a whole," Fong said.
Those interested in the scholar
ship must submit applications to
the Office of Student Activities by
Feb. 9. A panel composed of Sig
Eps from the scholarship commit
tee and non-Greek students will
select ;i pool of semi-finalists for
individual interviews.
I bis committee will select final
ists to continue in a second round
of interviews with a panel com
posed of students, local Sig Ep
alumni and members of the Uni
versity administration. The panel
will announce the winner in early
March and award him $ 1,000.
