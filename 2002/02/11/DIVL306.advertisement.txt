Financial Services at the Speed of Life
Search for Convenience
Ends with a Click and a Smile
A disturbing trend is rocking the'
financial world—complications so
vexingly complex that an intelligent
plexus of individuals are perplexed.
Wbatzappening has the exclusive story
of one woman 's nightmarish search for
convenience—and the simple click that
saved her.
My name is Erica Cloe Duzit. My
friends call me E.G. This is my story. I
stopped by the bank to see about a loan.
Next thing I knew, I was getting a slimy
sell-job from a teller that looked like she
hadn't left the vault in years. Her
personality was that of a banana slug—
and she moved at about the same rate of
speed.
"Just fill out this'stack of forms,"
she said."Wait for the forms to get filed.
Wait for Loan Headquarters to decide on
your worthiness and then wait for the
loan to get funded."
"Might as well get comfortable,"
she added."You might be here fora very
long time." She laughed a slow but
maniacal laugh. I ran. sweating and
stumbling, from the building.
After recounting my frightening
tale to my roommate, he told me to
click-it. I felt shunned until he explained
that I need simply access www.sfcu.org
and click.

And so I did. I filled out the
short online membership application
then checked out their loans. I found
great rates on auto loans and on the
computer loan I needed. I got 100%
financing, a generous term of 48
months and, best of all, by using
Loan Click, I was approved in less than
one minute!
I also learned that I can get E
checking, E-statements and printable
copies of cancelled checks. I can
order checks, transfer money, pay my
bills and check the status of any loan
or account with SFCU.
1 even checked out their Mort
gage Mart and filled out a pre-qualifier
application so when the right piece of
property comes along, I'll be ready.
SFCU, thank you. Thank you for
offering loans at the speed of life.
E.C. Duzit couldn't
be happier since she
discovered SFCU's
electronic services.
CITCK IT!
