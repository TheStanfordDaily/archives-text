## The 						Stanford Daily Rice a good choice as commencement speaker 
### 
Published Since 1891

The senior class presidents, members
of the senior class and University of
ficials should be commended for
their selection of Condoleezza Rice
as the graduation speaker.
Rice will provide a relevant and unifying
voice to usher the class of 2002 out of Stan
ford and into its role as leaders of the next
generation. Rice's academic and profes
sional careers reflect the highest achieve
ment, and she will stand before the gradu
ates as an example of character, scholar
ship and commitment — values that a
Stanford education hopes to instill in each
of its students.
As national security adviser, Rice is playing
an integral role in the development of the na-

tion and the world following Sept. 11. What
ever a graduate's future plans, each has been
and will continue to be afFected by Sept. 11
and its impact on policy, economics and cul
ture. Rice's firsthand experience will allow
her to provide insight into the students' fu
ture as citizens of the world and motivate
them to serve their fellow citizens.
In her time at Stanford, Rice contributed
to the University in her teaching and re
search. In addition to receiving several of the
highest teaching awards in the University,
Rice's research on Soviet and East European
foreign and defense policy influenced for
mer President George H.W. Bush's adminis
tration, where she served on the National Se
curity Council.

Rice's extensive tenure on the Farm will
leave her well-equipped to inspire the grad
uates. Rice understands the tremendous di
versity of background and opinion of Stan
ford's students. In this critical period of his
tory she will have the opportunity to offer
relevant guidance to a population with which
she is familiar.
In addition, Rice will bring the national
appeal that both the graduating class and the
University crave. Media sources have recent
ly stated that in this time of national crisis,
Rice's access to the President is second only
to Laura Bush. Rice has garnered increased
publicity as she continues to perform beyond
the scope of duty traditionally attributed to
her office.

and two opinions editors. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

As a Republican and an honorary Hoover
Fellow, Rice's presence clearly carries parti
san implications. Yet she behaves politically
not to promote her party's agenda but as a
servant to her nation, and her message has
always been one of unity.
Rice can accomplish everything that a
commencement speaker is meant for,
namely to motivate and inspire students
and bring prestige to the University. So
Class of 2002, we urge you to rally behind
Rice and welcome her back to Stanford with
support and enthusiasm. With all of your
hard work, you have earned the right to
hear one of the world's most influential po
litical figures congratulate you on your
graduation day.
