Three no's' sum up Arab position on Israel
I am responding to the oversimplifica
tions and factual inaccuracies in (lie cam
pus viewpoint article regarding the "be
trayal" of the Palestinians by Israel and the
world community. The authors of last
week's Campus Viewpoint column ("Israel
and the world have taken away rights of
Palestinians," 2 / 7 / 02) selectively choose
to depict very real Palestinian hardships as
isolated events in time, without reference
to their self-destructive causes.
The sense in which the authors use the
words "occupation" and "1967 Palestinian
territory" is meaningless, since the terms
are founded on false assumptions. There
never was a nation of Palestine in the West
Bank or Gaza — or anywhere, for that
matter. Palestine is a Roman name fora re
gion that includes modern-day Israel and
Jordan, just as Siberia is a region of Russia
or the Pacific Northwest is a region of the
United States.
The West Bank and Gaza have arbi
trary borders delineated by the cease-fire
lines of the 1948 war. What was Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion fighting for prior to Israel's capture
of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967? It
certainly was not lighting against the
Egyptian/ Jordanian occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza—rather, it was
against Israel's very existence that his
group was fighting.
After initiating and losing the 1967 war,
the Arab League issued a declaration of
three "no's" in Khartoum — no to peace,
no to negotiations and no to recognition of
Israel's right to exist. These three no's
were officially embodied in the Palestinian
Charter until the 1990s and are still the
rallying cry of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and
Palestinian officials speaking in Arabic to
Arab audiences.
Whether or not the destruction of Israel
is justified is beyond the scope of my re
sponse. However, it is important to under
stand that Israel was not and is not willing
to lend a hand to its own demise.
What is needed today is a pragmatic so
lution, not a pointless ideological battle.
Anyone who believes in the sincerity of
the Arab world's concern for Palestinians
has their head in the Gaza sand. Real con
cern would result in providing humani
tarian relief, settling refugees and encour
aging a peaceful resolution to the conflict
with Israel.
Unfortunately, the Arabs interpreted
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and sub
sequent generous peace proposals at
Camp David as signs of weakness. The
Palestinians initiated the current wave of
terror and violence because they believed
they could extract more than Israel would
willingly offer them in a peace agreement.
I bis theme, very clearly articulated by
Hamas, Hizbollah et al., could be summed
up as "give terror a chance."
1 lammam and Blaustein refer to a small
minority of Israeli soldiers refusing to serve
in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel is a
democratic country with many voices and
leftist elements every bit as radical as those
at Berkeley. It is this democracy which en
sures that Israel treats the Palestinians in a
moral way. This does not mean that Pales

tinian civilians are not suffering — clearly
they are, but the burden is on the Palestini
ans to end t he terror.
Finally, it is also on account of Israel's
democracy that many Israelis who sup
ported Sharon in the war on terror, my
self included, will be the first to show him
the door if the terror ends and he fails to
seize the opportunity for peace with
Palestinians.

IHUM Director defends evaluation process
I'm really tired of coming across (in re
cent editorials, guest editorials, and even
feature articles) as a faceless IHUM bu
reaucrat who has a major stake in the pre
sent system and is incapable ofcarrying out
an evaluation of it.
But I also disapprove deeply of the
notion that interested parties should be
carrying out any kind of substantive dis
cussion in the pages of The Daily, and
only there. I actually approve of the fact
that the Freedom Forum cares enough
about Area One that ihey want to spend
the time to study it, even though, as cor
rectly stated in recent Daily articles, I'm
skeptical about the viability of a "core
list" of readings.
But The Daily has been part of (he
problem. It decries the idea that we "seem
to be ignoring the input of the Freedom
Forum" and that of "other interested stu
dent groups" ("IIIUM program review
must be independent," 2 / 8 / 02), appar
ently without bothering to find out
whether (hey have in fact tried to have
regular human input to the regular Uni
versity processes.
Some have, some haven't. I'm having a
first discussion with Freedom Forum lead
ers next week, the first time we have ever
spoken to each other in person.
I don't blame this fact on them at all. We
were asked in a Daily interview to respond
to Daily reports of their opinions, and they
wrote a guest editorial reacting to our re
ported opinions based on that Daily re
port. As a process, this seems a bit wanting.
But you surely compound this by react
ing in an editorial to what is essentially your
own reporting.
Are we talking to the Freedom Forum?
Surely, as soon as we could arrange it.
Do we care about the concerns of mi
nority students who feel (I think correctly)
that we need a bit more non-canonical
reading in our IHUM classes? You bet.
Two responses to specific parts of your
editorial: As presently arranged, next
year's evaluation of IHUM (which, in
deed, the IHUM "bureaucrats" have to do
most of the work for — but can a bureau
cracy consist of six people who really
care?) has to go to the IHUM Governance
Board (which includes three students), the
Faculty Senate Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies (also three students, I think),
and the Faculty Senate itself.
As I'm quoted as saying in a Daily article,
we search for warts, and expect warts in the
review. We actually have an Education
School class dedicated, I hope, to evaluat
ing us honestly, and we've already (appar

ently unknown to The Daily, not that they
bothered to ask) added a bunch of ques
tions to the Senior Survey about IH U M (of
course the opinions of former takers of
I HUM count!).
But the second response is actually
reasonably positive. Yes, the school of
Humanities and Sciences has outside re
views of departments and programs (i.e.,
with professors from outside the univer
sity and the program). In its young life,
the office of the Vice Provost for Under
grduate Education hasn't had to deal
with this kind of stuff a lot. It's not a bad
idea. Too bad it's couched in such an un
informed diatribe.

Wais responds to judicial board letter
Last Friday's letter from Steph Cheung
concerning my decision to place an alcohol
suspension on Kappa Sigma Fraternity
contained a very misleading title and some
misinformation.
I did not "sidestep" the Greek Judicial
Board, as the title exclaimed, or "deviate"
from the board's recommendations, as
Cheung stated. I accepted and endorsed
all six recommendations provided by the
Board after extensive consultation with
them. It should be noted that the Greek Ju
dicial Board serves in an advisory capacity
to the Dean of Students.
1 added the additional alcohol suspen
sion sanction based on the compelling find
ings of the Board. Cheung is right that this
is the first time in quite a while — more
than four years — that I have felt the need
to take such action.

Article misrepresented Hawaiian culture
On Jan. 30, The Daily published an ar
ticle featuring the Stanford Hawai'i Club
and its upcoming lu'au celebration
("Aloha: Hawaii Club aims to spread
awareness," 2/30/01). I speak on behalf of
the Hawai'i Club in saying that we do ap
preciate the publicity and support from
The Daily. However, as one of the inter

viewees and as a resident of Hawai'i, I am
compelled to respond to the misleading
and offensive portrayals of Hawai'i and
Native Hawaiians, and to the miscommu
nication of facts.
Several errors were discovered in the
article, ranging from incorrect spelling to
confusion of facts to misquoting. We care
fully spelled out and defined Hawaiian
terms (such as Hawai'i, lu'au, 'ukulele,
'auana, and Hawaiian slack-key guitar)
during the interview, but they were care
lessly misspelled in the article.
Trivial as it may seem, one must recog
nize that any changes in spelling could po
tentially alter the meaning of the words in
Hawaiian language.
Also, the primary interviewee, Jordan
Lee, was carelessly introduced as "Lee"
halfway into the article without any pre
ceding reference to his full name or identi
ty as one of five Hawai'i Club Lu'au Chairs.
His quote suggesting that "all club mem
bers but one grew up in Hawai'i" is also
false and misleading.
Perhaps it was a simple misunderstand
ing on the part of the writer, but I do want
to emphasize that the Hawai'i Club is not
entirely exclusive but open to any Stanford
student interested in local or native Hawai
ian culture. In fact, there are several mem
bers who are not local Hawai'i residents or
Native Hawaiians.
Several of my quotes were also commu
nicated incorrectly, along with other facts.
Notably, the course "'Onipa'a: Native
Hawaiian Sovereignty" was offered last
quarter, while the course "Beyond Par
adise: Contemporary Native Hawaiian Is
sues" is being offered this quarter and will
culminate in an Alternative Spring Break
trip to Hawai'i.
Aside from factual and technical errors,
the offensive nature of the article stemmed
primarily from its romanticized and at times
rac ialized depiction of Native Hawaiian cul
ture, especially in the first paragraph.
The author wrote, "Approximately 500
gyrating students and Bay Area locals will
descend upon Manzanita court to roast
pigs and slurp squid."
Perhaps some thought this was a capti
vating introduction or even a clever use of
alliteration. But stop fora minute and
think about the imagery evoked by this
statement — maybe an image of primitive
savages "descending" in hordes on a pig, of

uncivilized natives "slurping squid," or of a
throng of scantily clad exoticas "gyrating"
lasciviously.
While not every reader necessarily per
ceived such negative stereotypes from the
article, this dangerous rhetoric, no matter
how innocent and unintending, inevitably
breeds already common misperceptions of
Native Hawaiian culture.
Native Hawaiians have been historically
romanticized as less-civilized or exotic and
commercialized as simple and conquer
able. The rhetoric used in the article ulti
mately perpetuates these internalized im
ages and disregards the rich and spiritual
indigenous Hawaiian culture.
The author alleges that "For those un
familiar with Hawaiian culture, the best
place to learn will be the Lu'au." Although
this is a ready opportunity to start learn
ing more, it is increasingly apparent that
the consumption of Hawaiian food, music
and dance during lu'au merely scratches
the surface of what people need to know
about Hawai'i.
It is my hope that Stanford students will
come to the lu'au to join us in celebration,
to be introduced to Polynesian culture and
to understand that there is a world of rich
indigenous culture that defies popular
stereotypes and misrepresentations.

terms (such as Hawai'i, lu'au, 'ukulele,
'auana, and Hawaiian slack-key guitar)
during the interview, but they were care
lessly misspelled in the article.
Trivial as it may seem, one must recog
nize that any changes in spelling could po
tentially alter the meaning of the words in
Hawaiian language.
Also, the primary interviewee, Jordan
Lee, was carelessly introduced as "Lee"
halfway into the article without any pre
ceding reference to his full name or identi
ty as one of five Hawai'i Club Lu'au Chairs.
His quote suggesting that "all club mem
bers but one grew up in Hawai'i" is also
false and misleading.
Perhaps it was a simple misunderstand
ing on the part of the writer, but I do want
to emphasize that the Hawai'i Club is not
entirely exclusive but open to any Stanford
student interested in local or native Hawai
ian culture. In fact, there are several mem
bers who are not local Hawai'i residents or
Native Hawaiians.
Several of my quotes were also commu
nicated incorrectly, along with other facts.
Notably, the course "'Onipa'a: Native
Hawaiian Sovereignty" was offered last
quarter, while the course "Beyond Par
adise: Contemporary Native Hawaiian Is
sues" is being offered this quarter and will
culminate in an Alternative Spring Break
trip to Hawai'i.
Aside from factual and technical errors,
the offensive nature of the article stemmed
primarily from its romanticized and at times
rac ialized depiction of Native Hawaiian cul
ture, especially in the first paragraph.
The author wrote, "Approximately 500
gyrating students and Bay Area locals will
descend upon Manzanita court to roast
pigs and slurp squid."
Perhaps some thought this was a capti
vating introduction or even a clever use of
alliteration. But stop fora minute and
think about the imagery evoked by this
statement — maybe an image of primitive
savages "descending" in hordes on a pig, of

uncivilized natives "slurping squid," or of a
throng of scantily clad exoticas "gyrating"
lasciviously.
While not every reader necessarily per
ceived such negative stereotypes from the
article, this dangerous rhetoric, no matter
how innocent and unintending, inevitably
breeds already common misperceptions of
Native Hawaiian culture.
Native Hawaiians have been historically
romanticized as less-civilized or exotic and
commercialized as simple and conquer
able. The rhetoric used in the article ulti
mately perpetuates these internalized im
ages and disregards the rich and spiritual
indigenous Hawaiian culture.
The author alleges that "For those un
familiar with Hawaiian culture, the best
place to learn will be the Lu'au." Although
this is a ready opportunity to start learn
ing more, it is increasingly apparent that
the consumption of Hawaiian food, music
and dance during lu'au merely scratches
the surface of what people need to know
about Hawai'i.
It is my hope that Stanford students will
come to the lu'au to join us in celebration,
to be introduced to Polynesian culture and
to understand that there is a world of rich
indigenous culture that defies popular
stereotypes and misrepresentations.

Three no's' sum up Arab position on Israel
I am responding to the oversimplifica
tions and factual inaccuracies in (lie cam
pus viewpoint article regarding the "be
trayal" of the Palestinians by Israel and the
world community. The authors of last
week's Campus Viewpoint column ("Israel
and the world have taken away rights of
Palestinians," 2 / 7 / 02) selectively choose
to depict very real Palestinian hardships as
isolated events in time, without reference
to their self-destructive causes.
The sense in which the authors use the
words "occupation" and "1967 Palestinian
territory" is meaningless, since the terms
are founded on false assumptions. There
never was a nation of Palestine in the West
Bank or Gaza — or anywhere, for that
matter. Palestine is a Roman name fora re
gion that includes modern-day Israel and
Jordan, just as Siberia is a region of Russia
or the Pacific Northwest is a region of the
United States.
The West Bank and Gaza have arbi
trary borders delineated by the cease-fire
lines of the 1948 war. What was Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion fighting for prior to Israel's capture
of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967? It
certainly was not lighting against the
Egyptian/ Jordanian occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza—rather, it was
against Israel's very existence that his
group was fighting.
After initiating and losing the 1967 war,
the Arab League issued a declaration of
three "no's" in Khartoum — no to peace,
no to negotiations and no to recognition of
Israel's right to exist. These three no's
were officially embodied in the Palestinian
Charter until the 1990s and are still the
rallying cry of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and
Palestinian officials speaking in Arabic to
Arab audiences.
Whether or not the destruction of Israel
is justified is beyond the scope of my re
sponse. However, it is important to under
stand that Israel was not and is not willing
to lend a hand to its own demise.
What is needed today is a pragmatic so
lution, not a pointless ideological battle.
Anyone who believes in the sincerity of
the Arab world's concern for Palestinians
has their head in the Gaza sand. Real con
cern would result in providing humani
tarian relief, settling refugees and encour
aging a peaceful resolution to the conflict
with Israel.
Unfortunately, the Arabs interpreted
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and sub
sequent generous peace proposals at
Camp David as signs of weakness. The
Palestinians initiated the current wave of
terror and violence because they believed
they could extract more than Israel would
willingly offer them in a peace agreement.
I bis theme, very clearly articulated by
Hamas, Hizbollah et al., could be summed
up as "give terror a chance."
1 lammam and Blaustein refer to a small
minority of Israeli soldiers refusing to serve
in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel is a
democratic country with many voices and
leftist elements every bit as radical as those
at Berkeley. It is this democracy which en
sures that Israel treats the Palestinians in a
moral way. This does not mean that Pales

tinian civilians are not suffering — clearly
they are, but the burden is on the Palestini
ans to end t he terror.
Finally, it is also on account of Israel's
democracy that many Israelis who sup
ported Sharon in the war on terror, my
self included, will be the first to show him
the door if the terror ends and he fails to
seize the opportunity for peace with
Palestinians.

IHUM Director defends evaluation process
I'm really tired of coming across (in re
cent editorials, guest editorials, and even
feature articles) as a faceless IHUM bu
reaucrat who has a major stake in the pre
sent system and is incapable ofcarrying out
an evaluation of it.
But I also disapprove deeply of the
notion that interested parties should be
carrying out any kind of substantive dis
cussion in the pages of The Daily, and
only there. I actually approve of the fact
that the Freedom Forum cares enough
about Area One that ihey want to spend
the time to study it, even though, as cor
rectly stated in recent Daily articles, I'm
skeptical about the viability of a "core
list" of readings.
But The Daily has been part of (he
problem. It decries the idea that we "seem
to be ignoring the input of the Freedom
Forum" and that of "other interested stu
dent groups" ("IIIUM program review
must be independent," 2 / 8 / 02), appar
ently without bothering to find out
whether (hey have in fact tried to have
regular human input to the regular Uni
versity processes.
Some have, some haven't. I'm having a
first discussion with Freedom Forum lead
ers next week, the first time we have ever
spoken to each other in person.
I don't blame this fact on them at all. We
were asked in a Daily interview to respond
to Daily reports of their opinions, and they
wrote a guest editorial reacting to our re
ported opinions based on that Daily re
port. As a process, this seems a bit wanting.
But you surely compound this by react
ing in an editorial to what is essentially your
own reporting.
Are we talking to the Freedom Forum?
Surely, as soon as we could arrange it.
Do we care about the concerns of mi
nority students who feel (I think correctly)
that we need a bit more non-canonical
reading in our IHUM classes? You bet.
Two responses to specific parts of your
editorial: As presently arranged, next
year's evaluation of IHUM (which, in
deed, the IHUM "bureaucrats" have to do
most of the work for — but can a bureau
cracy consist of six people who really
care?) has to go to the IHUM Governance
Board (which includes three students), the
Faculty Senate Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies (also three students, I think),
and the Faculty Senate itself.
As I'm quoted as saying in a Daily article,
we search for warts, and expect warts in the
review. We actually have an Education
School class dedicated, I hope, to evaluat
ing us honestly, and we've already (appar

ently unknown to The Daily, not that they
bothered to ask) added a bunch of ques
tions to the Senior Survey about IH U M (of
course the opinions of former takers of
I HUM count!).
But the second response is actually
reasonably positive. Yes, the school of
Humanities and Sciences has outside re
views of departments and programs (i.e.,
with professors from outside the univer
sity and the program). In its young life,
the office of the Vice Provost for Under
grduate Education hasn't had to deal
with this kind of stuff a lot. It's not a bad
idea. Too bad it's couched in such an un
informed diatribe.

Wais responds to judicial board letter
Last Friday's letter from Steph Cheung
concerning my decision to place an alcohol
suspension on Kappa Sigma Fraternity
contained a very misleading title and some
misinformation.
I did not "sidestep" the Greek Judicial
Board, as the title exclaimed, or "deviate"
from the board's recommendations, as
Cheung stated. I accepted and endorsed
all six recommendations provided by the
Board after extensive consultation with
them. It should be noted that the Greek Ju
dicial Board serves in an advisory capacity
to the Dean of Students.
1 added the additional alcohol suspen
sion sanction based on the compelling find
ings of the Board. Cheung is right that this
is the first time in quite a while — more
than four years — that I have felt the need
to take such action.

Article misrepresented Hawaiian culture
On Jan. 30, The Daily published an ar
ticle featuring the Stanford Hawai'i Club
and its upcoming lu'au celebration
("Aloha: Hawaii Club aims to spread
awareness," 2/30/01). I speak on behalf of
the Hawai'i Club in saying that we do ap
preciate the publicity and support from
The Daily. However, as one of the inter

viewees and as a resident of Hawai'i, I am
compelled to respond to the misleading
and offensive portrayals of Hawai'i and
Native Hawaiians, and to the miscommu
nication of facts.
Several errors were discovered in the
article, ranging from incorrect spelling to
confusion of facts to misquoting. We care
fully spelled out and defined Hawaiian
terms (such as Hawai'i, lu'au, 'ukulele,
'auana, and Hawaiian slack-key guitar)
during the interview, but they were care

Wais responds to judicial board letter
Last Friday's letter from Steph Cheung
concerning my decision to place an alcohol
suspension on Kappa Sigma Fraternity
contained a very misleading title and some
misinformation.
I did not "sidestep" the Greek Judicial
Board, as the title exclaimed, or "deviate"
from the board's recommendations, as
Cheung stated. I accepted and endorsed
all six recommendations provided by the
Board after extensive consultation with
them. It should be noted that the Greek Ju
dicial Board serves in an advisory capacity
to the Dean of Students.
1 added the additional alcohol suspen
sion sanction based on the compelling find

Article misrepresented Hawaiian culture
On Jan. 30, The Daily published an ar
ticle featuring the Stanford Hawai'i Club
and its upcoming lu'au celebration
("Aloha: Hawaii Club aims to spread
awareness," 2/30/01). I speak on behalf of
the Hawai'i Club in saying that we do ap
preciate the publicity and support from
The Daily. However, as one of the inter

viewees and as a resident of Hawai'i, I am
compelled to respond to the misleading
and offensive portrayals of Hawai'i and
Native Hawaiians, and to the miscommu
nication of facts.
Several errors were discovered in the
article, ranging from incorrect spelling to
confusion of facts to misquoting. We care
fully spelled out and defined Hawaiian
terms (such as Hawai'i, lu'au, 'ukulele,
'auana, and Hawaiian slack-key guitar)
during the interview, but they were care
lessly misspelled in the article.
Trivial as it may seem, one must recog
nize that any changes in spelling could po
tentially alter the meaning of the words in
Hawaiian language.
Also, the primary interviewee, Jordan
Lee, was carelessly introduced as "Lee"
halfway into the article without any pre
ceding reference to his full name or identi
ty as one of five Hawai'i Club Lu'au Chairs.
His quote suggesting that "all club mem
bers but one grew up in Hawai'i" is also
false and misleading.
Perhaps it was a simple misunderstand
ing on the part of the writer, but I do want
to emphasize that the Hawai'i Club is not
entirely exclusive but open to any Stanford
student interested in local or native Hawai
ian culture. In fact, there are several mem
bers who are not local Hawai'i residents or
Native Hawaiians.
Several of my quotes were also commu
nicated incorrectly, along with other facts.
Notably, the course "'Onipa'a: Native
Hawaiian Sovereignty" was offered last
quarter, while the course "Beyond Par
adise: Contemporary Native Hawaiian Is
sues" is being offered this quarter and will
culminate in an Alternative Spring Break
trip to Hawai'i.
Aside from factual and technical errors,
the offensive nature of the article stemmed
primarily from its romanticized and at times
rac ialized depiction of Native Hawaiian cul
ture, especially in the first paragraph.
The author wrote, "Approximately 500
gyrating students and Bay Area locals will
descend upon Manzanita court to roast
pigs and slurp squid."
Perhaps some thought this was a capti
vating introduction or even a clever use of
alliteration. But stop fora minute and
think about the imagery evoked by this
statement — maybe an image of primitive
savages "descending" in hordes on a pig, of

uncivilized natives "slurping squid," or of a
throng of scantily clad exoticas "gyrating"
lasciviously.
While not every reader necessarily per
ceived such negative stereotypes from the
article, this dangerous rhetoric, no matter
how innocent and unintending, inevitably
breeds already common misperceptions of
Native Hawaiian culture.
Native Hawaiians have been historically
romanticized as less-civilized or exotic and
commercialized as simple and conquer
able. The rhetoric used in the article ulti
mately perpetuates these internalized im
ages and disregards the rich and spiritual
indigenous Hawaiian culture.
The author alleges that "For those un
familiar with Hawaiian culture, the best
place to learn will be the Lu'au." Although
this is a ready opportunity to start learn
ing more, it is increasingly apparent that
the consumption of Hawaiian food, music
and dance during lu'au merely scratches
the surface of what people need to know
about Hawai'i.
It is my hope that Stanford students will
come to the lu'au to join us in celebration,
to be introduced to Polynesian culture and
to understand that there is a world of rich
indigenous culture that defies popular
stereotypes and misrepresentations.

Three no's' sum up Arab position on Israel
I am responding to the oversimplifica
tions and factual inaccuracies in (lie cam
pus viewpoint article regarding the "be
trayal" of the Palestinians by Israel and the
world community. The authors of last
week's Campus Viewpoint column ("Israel
and the world have taken away rights of
Palestinians," 2 / 7 / 02) selectively choose
to depict very real Palestinian hardships as
isolated events in time, without reference
to their self-destructive causes.
The sense in which the authors use the
words "occupation" and "1967 Palestinian
territory" is meaningless, since the terms
are founded on false assumptions. There
never was a nation of Palestine in the West
Bank or Gaza — or anywhere, for that
matter. Palestine is a Roman name fora re
gion that includes modern-day Israel and
Jordan, just as Siberia is a region of Russia
or the Pacific Northwest is a region of the
United States.
The West Bank and Gaza have arbi
trary borders delineated by the cease-fire
lines of the 1948 war. What was Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion fighting for prior to Israel's capture
of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967? It
certainly was not lighting against the
Egyptian/ Jordanian occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza—rather, it was
against Israel's very existence that his
group was fighting.
After initiating and losing the 1967 war,
the Arab League issued a declaration of
three "no's" in Khartoum — no to peace,
no to negotiations and no to recognition of
Israel's right to exist. These three no's
were officially embodied in the Palestinian
Charter until the 1990s and are still the
rallying cry of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and
Palestinian officials speaking in Arabic to
Arab audiences.
Whether or not the destruction of Israel
is justified is beyond the scope of my re
sponse. However, it is important to under
stand that Israel was not and is not willing
to lend a hand to its own demise.
What is needed today is a pragmatic so
lution, not a pointless ideological battle.
Anyone who believes in the sincerity of
the Arab world's concern for Palestinians
has their head in the Gaza sand. Real con
cern would result in providing humani
tarian relief, settling refugees and encour
aging a peaceful resolution to the conflict
with Israel.
Unfortunately, the Arabs interpreted
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and sub
sequent generous peace proposals at
Camp David as signs of weakness. The
Palestinians initiated the current wave of
terror and violence because they believed
they could extract more than Israel would
willingly offer them in a peace agreement.
I bis theme, very clearly articulated by
Hamas, Hizbollah et al., could be summed
up as "give terror a chance."
1 lammam and Blaustein refer to a small
minority of Israeli soldiers refusing to serve
in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel is a
democratic country with many voices and
leftist elements every bit as radical as those
at Berkeley. It is this democracy which en
sures that Israel treats the Palestinians in a
moral way. This does not mean that Pales

tinian civilians are not suffering — clearly
they are, but the burden is on the Palestini
ans to end t he terror.
Finally, it is also on account of Israel's
democracy that many Israelis who sup
ported Sharon in the war on terror, my
self included, will be the first to show him
the door if the terror ends and he fails to
seize the opportunity for peace with
Palestinians.

IHUM Director defends evaluation process
I'm really tired of coming across (in re
cent editorials, guest editorials, and even
feature articles) as a faceless IHUM bu
reaucrat who has a major stake in the pre
sent system and is incapable ofcarrying out
an evaluation of it.
But I also disapprove deeply of the
notion that interested parties should be
carrying out any kind of substantive dis
cussion in the pages of The Daily, and
only there. I actually approve of the fact
that the Freedom Forum cares enough
about Area One that ihey want to spend
the time to study it, even though, as cor
rectly stated in recent Daily articles, I'm
skeptical about the viability of a "core
list" of readings.
But The Daily has been part of (he
problem. It decries the idea that we "seem
to be ignoring the input of the Freedom
Forum" and that of "other interested stu
dent groups" ("IIIUM program review
must be independent," 2 / 8 / 02), appar
ently without bothering to find out
whether (hey have in fact tried to have
regular human input to the regular Uni
versity processes.
Some have, some haven't. I'm having a
first discussion with Freedom Forum lead
ers next week, the first time we have ever
spoken to each other in person.
I don't blame this fact on them at all. We
were asked in a Daily interview to respond
to Daily reports of their opinions, and they
wrote a guest editorial reacting to our re
ported opinions based on that Daily re
port. As a process, this seems a bit wanting.
But you surely compound this by react
ing in an editorial to what is essentially your
own reporting.
