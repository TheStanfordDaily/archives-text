On the front page of Friday's Daily, a
caption misidentified Donald Walkowitz
and mistakenly indicated that he attend
ed the Faculty Senate meeting. In fact,
Walkowitz was photographed participat
ing in a town hall meeting sponsored by
the Coalition Against Subcontracting.
In Friday's article "Faculty Senate ex
tends Sym Sys five more years," The
Daily attributed statements about the
Symbolic Systems program to "Symbolic
Systems professor Bruce Wooley." The
speaker was not Wooley — who is actual
ly a professor in the School of Engineer
ing — but Assoc. Prof of Religious Stud
ies Hester Gelber, chair of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies.
