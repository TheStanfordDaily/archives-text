KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — An aunt of the main
suspect in the kidnapping of Wall Street Journal re
porter Daniel Pearl spoke with her nephew by tele
phone and pleaded with him to turn himself in, Pak
istan's interior minister said yesterday.
Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh and his aunt talked by
cellphone last Tuesday, and she told him she was in
police custody and urged him to turn himself in, In
terior Minister Moinuddin I laider said. Police believe
Saeed, a British-born Islamic militant, masterminded
Pearl's Jan. 23 kidnapping.
"She said: 'We have been rounded up by the police
and I think your game is out and we didn't know you
were indulging in this. You better hand over your
self,' and after that his telephone went dead," I laider
told reporters in Karachi, where Pearl disappeared
more than two weeks ago.
Haider did not give the name of Saeed's aunt,
who made the call from Karachi. She and one of her
three sons have been released. The two others re
main in custody.
Police believe Saeed has left Karachi but is still in
Pakistan, said Haider. But Haider said he is certain
that Pearl is still being held captive in this sprawling

city of 14 million people on the Arabian Sea.
"We very strongly feel that he is in Karachi. He
could not have moved out of Karachi by road or rail
or air. He would have been detected," Haider said.
"I lis abductors would not have taken this risk because
there are many checkposts along the road.
Haider said Pearl took "unnecessary risks" by
going alone to a Karachi restaurant on Jan. 23 to meet
contacts he thought had arranged an interview with
the leader of a small Islamic group. Pearl was appar
ently investigating links between Pakistani militants
and Richard C. Reid, the so-called shoe bomber ar
rested on a Paris-to-Miami flight in December with
explosives in his sneakers.
"To fall into the hands of these go-betweens, fixers
and contacts who were of dubious character and
meeting them at odd places I think he put himself at
great risk," 1 laider said.
Saeed is believed to be tied to the Jaish-e-Mo
hammed group, which had close links to
Afghanistan's ousted Taliban regime and Osama bin
Laden's al-Qaida network.
Saeed was arrested in India in 1994 for the kid
napping of Western backpackers.
