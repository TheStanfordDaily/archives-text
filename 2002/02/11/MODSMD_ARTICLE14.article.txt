## Stanford finishes big against OSU Cardinal pulls into four-way tie for third in Pac-10 race

It didn't turn out to be a case of
weekend complacency, nor a case
of a team letting down its guard
after a monumental win.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 20 Stanford
77, Oregon State 55

But, fora while on Saturday, it
sure felt like it.
Before Stanford's 77-55 victory
over Oregon State, the No. 20
Cardinal (15-6, 8-4 Pacific 10
Conference) had gone 1-4 in

weekend conference play.
Add the fact that Stanford was
coming off of a crucial overtime
victory over No. 13 Oregon on
Thursday night, and the 5,905
fans at Maples Pavilion were
forced to hold their breaths for 30
minutes before a struggling Car
dinal team finally pulled away.
"It wasn't pretty, but we'll take
it," Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "It looked
dicey fora while. They kept cut
ting [the lead] back."
The Beavers kept the game
close, only trailing by five at the
half. They trailed by just three
with 11:48 to play.
Eventually though, sopho
more backup forward Teyo John
son and freshman backup point
guard Chris Hernandez shot
some life into the Cardinal. John
son finished with five rebounds,

t hree assists and a career-high 15
points, including two straight 3-
pointers in the second half.
"We call it 'Project Green
Light,'" Johnson said. "If that
week you're shooting the 3-ball
well in practice, you get the okay
to shoot it in the game."
Without the timely and effec
tive play from the reserves, Stan
ford might have had its third
straight light to the finish, which
would have certainly taken an
greater toll on the starters.
"Personally, 1 felt really tired on
the floor. That's why it was so great
to have these contributions from
off the bench," said senior point
guard Tony Giovacchini. "I think
we were flat in warmups and I was
worried about where we were at
mentally before the game started.
"I was really afraid of this game
coming off the huge win 'Thurs
day night. It really taxed us phys
ically and emotionally."
The victory over the Beavers
kept Stanford one-and-a-half
games back of Pac-10 frontrunner
No. 11 Arizona, which swept the
Washington schools at home in
the McKale Center this weekend.
The Cardinal now finds itself in a
four-way tie for third place with
No. 25 Southern California, No.
15 UCLA and California.
Oregon, which fell to the Bears
in double overtime Saturday
night, dropped to second place
and one game behind the Wild
cats after being swept by the Bay
Area schools this weekend.

"It's going to be a pretty wild
couple of last weeks here," Gio
vacchini said. "The standings are
nothing like I've ever seen before,
and anybody's got a shot to win
this thing. We're picking it up at
the right time and we're glad that
we're in the hunt. 1 like our
chances down the stretch."
Junior guard Casey Jacobsen
struggled from the field, going 1-
for-7 from 3-point and total
ing 13 points. Jacobsen, who has
now scored 1,528 points in his ca
reer, moved into tenth place on
the all-time Stanford scoring list,
passing Keith Jones (1,516), who
played for the Cardinal from 1980
to 1984.
Junior center ( Hirtis Borchardt
finished with his tenth double
double of the season, with a team
high 20 points and 12 rebounds.
The big story of the night
though, was the clutch play from
off the bench. Ten different play
ers scored points, with Johnson
leading the way.
"It really helps to have a deep
team," Johnson said. On Thurs
day, it was [redshirt-sophomore
forward] Joe Kirchofer. Today, it
was me. That's the kind of team
we've got. It's safe to say that
we're one of the deepest teams in
the Pac-10."
Kirchofer, who tallied nine
points and nine rebounds on
Thursday night, earned the start
