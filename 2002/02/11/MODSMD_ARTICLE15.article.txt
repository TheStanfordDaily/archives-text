# Card eyes Pac-10 title

You can see it in their eyes
right now — they can still win
this thing and they know it.
It's as if all the prior ran tings
about "peaking at the right
time" and "finishing atop the
conference" were just said to
appease the crowd or to con
vince themselves that a Pacific
10 Conference championship
was still possible.
And now suddenly, with six
games left to play, first place is
in sight again.
On Saturday night after
their victory over Oregon State,
the Stanford men were saying
all of the same things.
"The standings are like noth

ing I've ever seen before," se
nior point guard Tony Giovao
chini said. "Anybody's got a shot
to win this thing. We're in the
hunt. I like our chances down
the stretch."
"We said it earlier when peo
ple weren't believing in us and
now it's happening," sopho
more Teyo Johnson said.
"We're peaking at the right
time. I think everybody can see
that as a team we're maturing."
Maybe we didn't entirely be
lieve them before.
But for some reason, it
sounded a little different this
time around.
There was a different kind
of confidence fueling the state
ments — an actual belief, perhaps,
that after all of the turmoil the
Cardinal still might be able to pull
this one out.
It's amazing what a difference
two games can make.
Suddenly playing up to poten
tial is grounded in the present
tense as opposed to the future. The
Cardinal isn't in that awkward
phase of "waiting to peak" any
more. It's peaking right now.
Stanford now sits in a tie for
third place with California, South
ern California and No. 15 UCLA.
All four schools are one and a half
games behind conference-leader
No. 11 Arizona and only a half
game behind Oregon, who will re

member this tragic trip to the Bay
Area fora while.
Despite the two victories, Stan
lord is still a work in progress.
Earlier this season, it was the
two-guard position that needed tin
kering. Junior guard Julius Barnes
has now settled in and seems com
fortable in his starting role.
Now the shuffling of the big
men is the big story. Stanford's
starting lineup has seen three dif
ferent looks in the past two weeks.
The power forward position is still
up in the air and head coach Mike
Montgomery is still playing around
with his pieces.
" I don't care who starts, 1 really
don't," Montgomery said. "1 know
everybody else does. I'll put some
body in and if he plays, he'll stay.
But if he doesn't, I'll try to find
somebody else."
Johnson, who got his first start -

ing nod in last Saturday's loss to
Arizona over sophomore Justin
Davis, was quickly replaced by red
shirt sophomore Joe Kirchofer,
who has stepped in and played well
for the Cardinal in recent weeks.
"I'm trying to find somebody,"
Montgomery said. "I thought Joe
did a nice job. Frankly, I think, in
this game [against Oregon State]
and the way they were playing
four out probably wasn't Joe's cup
of tea. With a smaller lineup,l
think, Teyo is probably our best
bet there. We play Josh at the four
some, as well."
"When Coach takes you out of
the starting lineup that just has to
motivate you to come out there and
prove yourself on the floor," John
son said. "It really helps to have a
deep team and have guys that can
come in there with confidence."
Against Oregon State, junior

Curtis Borchardt led a balanced
scoring attack with 20 points, 12 re
bounds and two blocks, in a game
where ten Cardinal players made
their mark on the scoreboard.
"Personally, 1 felt really tired
today." Giovacchini said. "That's
why it was so great to have these
contributions coming off the bench.
Teyo and Chris turned the game
around for us. And their energy
was the key to the game for us."
Roles are still being redefined,
not only on this Cardinal team but
in the Pac-10 as a whole.
No longer is there a clear-cut
nemesis or underdog. Not only will
Stanford have to win out its final
games but some other teams are
going to have to win as well.
"Tonight was the first night that
I've ever cheered for Cal," Barnes
said. "It's fortunate for us that they
beat Oregon."
