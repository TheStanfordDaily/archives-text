# No. 1 Card crushes No. 8 Trojans
## Stanford swimmers set six records at pool that hosted '84 Olympics 
### KENNETH GARRETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 Southern California men's swim
team should have just stayed in bed on Saturday.
At least that would have saved them the humilia
tion of becoming the top-ranked Cardinal's play
thing. But the Trojans attempted to challenge
the best team in the country, and as a result had
their pride run through a blender. Stanford (7-
0, 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) crushed USC (4-5,
0-4) 156.5 to 84.5.

Saturday: No. 1 Stanford defeats No. 8
USC, 156.5-84.5

Okay, let's be fair to the Trojans; they swam fast.
It's just that the entire Cardinal team swam faster,
taking at least three of the top four spots in nine in
dividual events, on top of winning both relays.
"Their top guys did all that was expected of
them, and so did ours," said Stanford senior tri
captain Michael O'Neil. "But we showed more
depth than we've shown all season; almost every
body got a season best."
Not only were they season bests, but many of
Saturday's races saw national best times being set
as well.
The first victory of the day went to sophomore
Peter Marshall, who, with a national-best time of
46.55 in the 100 backstroke, became the fastest
swimmer ever in a collegiate dual meet in that event.
"Peter is just amazing. I learn a lot from watch
ing him," said sophomore Markus Rogan.

The feeling is most likely mutual, as Rogan
gained the same honor in the 400 Individual Med
ley by surpassing the previous national best (set by
Rogan himself) by over, three seconds, narrowly
out-touching Trojan Tamas Kerekjarto in 3:45.57.
"It doesn't come down to strength or anything
like that; it's just who wants it more," Rogan said.
USC's top swimmers also impressed the fans,
with Erik Vendt swimming a national best and all
time dual meet record in the 1000 free (8:49.59),
making him the eighth-fastest performer ever in
that event. Teammate Klete Keller won the 200
112 ree in 1:36.10, the second fastest time in the nation
this year.
The uninitiated fan should be aware that break
ing a pool record is rare. Doing it in the pool that
hosted the 1984 Olympics is unbelievable. Racking
up a whopping 18 swims under the previous best
marks is nothing less than historical. But that's
what happened on Saturday, with 6of 10 new pool
records going to Stanford.
One of the most amazing races for the Cardinal
was the 100 butterfly in which the top four finish
ers, all from Stanford, each broke the previous
pool record. Bobby O'Bryan now holds the record
with a blistering 48.13. Close behind him were
teammates Dan Westcott (48.16), Matt McDonald
(48.42) and Scott Ransenberg (48.46).
"We were all just amazed," said sophomore
Michael Bruce.
Bruce had some tricks up his own sleeve,
though, clinching first in both breaststroke events
in 54.75 and 1:56.93.
"We were just feeding off each other's fast
swims," Marshall said.
All that stands now between the Cardinal and its
21st consecutive Pac-10 championship is Califor-
