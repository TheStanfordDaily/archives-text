The sheer distance of a cross
country road trip precludes a
team from traveling with every
thing it wants. Last weekend at
Florida State, though, the Cardi

Scoring 30 runs against a deep
and experienced Seminole pitch
ing staff to take two-of-three
games in Tallahassee, the No. 1
Cardinal proved for the second
consecutive weekend that this sea
son, scoreboard operators would
be earning their money.
Highlighted by a ferocious
comeback effort to win Satur
day's game, 15-11, t he Cardinal
came within a run of sweeping
the No. (> Seminoles on their
home field.
Trailing 7-1 after two innings in
the Saturday contest, the Cardinal
charged back with nine unan
swered runs to take a 10-7 lead. Ju
nior catcher Ryan Garko, who
went H-for-4 on the day, blasted a
tape-measure home run with two
men on base in the Cardinal fifth

to spark Stanford's comeback.
"It goes to show what an experi
enced team we have." Garko said.
"There's no quit in this team.
We've been through games like
this before. We know we can swing
the bat."
Florida State, a team laden with
as many veterans as the Cardinal,
refused to lay down either. Sopho
more Tony Richie's three-run,
sixth-inning dinger tied the ball
game at 10-10, and an inning later
tlie Seminoles regained the lead
with an RBI single.
However, Stanford took ad
vantage of poor Florida State
pitching and a key error to put
up five more runs in the eighth
and seal the victory.
"I'm very proud of the way we
came back against a quality team
in a tough place to play," said
head coach Mark Marquess.
The win was the Cardinal's
fifth straight against the Semi
noles but provided the fans with
an NCAA first. Florida State
pitchers plunked sophomore
right fielder Carlos Quentin a l)i
-vision-l-record five times with
off-the-mark sliders, hitting him
several times in the same ankle.
None of the pitches appeared to
be intentional.

have an [NCAA] record, but it's
not too fun to get hit five times."

series opener on Friday night, 9-
3, crossing the plate seven times in
the game's first frame and receiv
ing another quality outing from
junior pitcher Jeremy Guthrie.
Guthrie scattered seven Semi
nole hits for three runs, just two
of which were earned, and
struck out eight in his second
start of the season.
Freshman Donny Lucy broke
into the lineup and made an im
mediate impact, chasing Florida
State ace Blair Varnes with a
two-RBI single as just the sev
enth batter of the game. The
freshman finished the game 2
for 3 with a stolen base and

th ree RBI to propel Stanford to
the win.
After Guthrie's exit in the sev
enth, junior pitcher Ryan Mc-
Cally continued his early season
success with three innings of
two-hit ball to earn his second
save of the year.
Varnes, however, would be
vindicated two days later. He
made his first career relief ap
pearance yesterday and picked
up the win by holding the Cardi
nal to one run in 3 2/3 innings on
the mound. Junior closer Eric
Roman survived a late Stanford
rally to preserve the 7-6 victory
for the Seminoles.
The Cardinal almost pulled
off its second improbable come
back of the series upon entering
the ninth down 7-4. Senior sec
ond baseman Chris O'Riordan

came up with a clutch two-run
homer and sophomore Sam Fuld
singled to bring the go-ahead
run to the plate. But with two
outs, Richie, the Seminoles'
catcher, cut down Fuld on a steal
attempt to dramatically end any
Stanford hopes for another
come-from-behind win.
One positive note to emerge
from yesterday's defeat was
freshman pitcher Mark Jecman,
who rebounded from a shaky
debut last week to throw 4 1/3
solid innings yesterday against
the Seminoles. He notched six
strikeouts and walked just one
batter but allowed five runs
(three earned), four of which
came in Florida State's big fifth
inning. Senior Mike Futrell hit
three home runs tn key the Semi
noles' series-saving win.

Highlighted by a ferocious
comeback effort to win Satur
day's game, 15-11, t he Cardinal
came within a run of sweeping
the No. (> Seminoles on their
home field.
Trailing 7-1 after two innings in
the Saturday contest, the Cardinal
charged back with nine unan
swered runs to take a 10-7 lead. Ju
nior catcher Ryan Garko, who
went H-for-4 on the day, blasted a
tape-measure home run with two
men on base in the Cardinal fifth

to spark Stanford's comeback.
"It goes to show what an experi
enced team we have." Garko said.
"There's no quit in this team.
We've been through games like
this before. We know we can swing
the bat."
Florida State, a team laden with
as many veterans as the Cardinal,
refused to lay down either. Sopho

sixth-inning dinger tied the ball
game at 10-10, and an inning later

with an RBI single.
However, Stanford took ad
vantage of poor Florida State
pitching and a key error to put
up five more runs in the eighth
and seal the victory.
"I'm very proud of the way we
came back against a quality team
in a tough place to play," said
head coach Mark Marquess.
The win was the Cardinal's
fifth straight against the Semi
noles but provided the fans with
an NCAA first. Florida State
pitchers plunked sophomore
right fielder Carlos Quentin a l)i
-vision-l-record five times with
off-the-mark sliders, hitting him
several times in the same ankle.
None of the pitches appeared to
be intentional.
"1 have kind of mixed feelings,"
Quentin said. "It's kind of fun to
have an [NCAA] record, but it's
not too fun to get hit five times."

series opener on Friday night, 9-
3, crossing the plate seven times in
the game's first frame and receiv
ing another quality outing from
junior pitcher Jeremy Guthrie.
Guthrie scattered seven Semi
nole hits for three runs, just two
of which were earned, and
struck out eight in his second
start of the season.
Freshman Donny Lucy broke
into the lineup and made an im
mediate impact, chasing Florida
State ace Blair Varnes with a
two-RBI single as just the sev
enth batter of the game. The
freshman finished the game 2
for 3 with a stolen base and

th ree RBI to propel Stanford to
the win.
After Guthrie's exit in the sev
enth, junior pitcher Ryan Mc-
Cally continued his early season
success with three innings of
two-hit ball to earn his second
save of the year.
Varnes, however, would be
vindicated two days later. He
made his first career relief ap
pearance yesterday and picked
up the win by holding the Cardi
nal to one run in 3 2/3 innings on
the mound. Junior closer Eric
Roman survived a late Stanford
rally to preserve the 7-6 victory
for the Seminoles.
The Cardinal almost pulled
off its second improbable come
back of the series upon entering
the ninth down 7-4. Senior sec
ond baseman Chris O'Riordan

came up with a clutch two-run
homer and sophomore Sam Fuld
singled to bring the go-ahead
run to the plate. But with two
outs, Richie, the Seminoles'
catcher, cut down Fuld on a steal
attempt to dramatically end any
Stanford hopes for another
come-from-behind win.
One positive note to emerge
from yesterday's defeat was
freshman pitcher Mark Jecman,
who rebounded from a shaky
debut last week to throw 4 1/3
solid innings yesterday against
the Seminoles. He notched six
strikeouts and walked just one
batter but allowed five runs
(three earned), four of which
came in Florida State's big fifth
inning. Senior Mike Futrell hit
three home runs tn key the Semi
noles' series-saving win.
The sheer distance of a cross
country road trip precludes a
team from traveling with every
thing it wants. Last weekend at
Florida State, though, the Cardi
nal certainly brought the lumber,
or, rather, the aluminum.
