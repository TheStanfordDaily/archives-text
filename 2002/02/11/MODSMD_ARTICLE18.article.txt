ready become apparent for the No. 2 Stan
ford men's tennis team.

MEN'S TENNIS
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford defeats No. 6
Illinois, 4-3, in the finals of the National
Team Indoor Championships

Apparently, the team has forgotten the
disappointing early exit from last year's
NCAA Championship.
Apparently, the team's top player, senior
K.J. Hippensteel, lias assumed the leader
ship role for this squad.
And apparently, the core of three juniors
is ready to step it up ;i notch this year.
With a thrilling 4-3 victory over No. 6 Illi
nois (0-1) yesterday, the Cardinal (5-0)
made all of the above clear by capturing a
record 12th title at the US I A / I I'A Nation
al Men's Team Indoor Championships in
Louisville, Ivy.
Stanford made its way to the final of the
tournament for the third time in five years
by posting a huge win over Pacific 10 Con
ference rival No. 12 Southern California in
the semifinals. The Cardinal also picked up
early-round victories over No. 52 San Diego
State and No. 9 Duke.
Illinois earned its spot in Sunday's final
with an impressive 4-1 upset over defend
ing NCAA champion Georgia in its semifi
nal match.

nois by capturing two out of the
three doubles matches.
Hie Cardinal expanded its lead
as No. 43 junior Ryan Haviland
(12-4) quickly dispatched of his op
ponent, Michael Calkins, 6-3, 6-2.
Fellow junior No. 49 David
Martin (1 1-3) was able to pull the
team even closer to victory with a
hard-fought 7-6 (4), 7-6 (1) upset
win over No. 23 Phil Stolt.
But the Cardinal would have
to wait for the one win it needed
to clinch the tournament.
I he Fighting Illini mounted a
daunting comeback by picking
up points at the No. 2, No. 5 and
No. 6 singles spots to level out the
match at three points apiece.
The stage was set for an excit
ing three-set battle at the top spot
between top-ranked Hippensteel
and No. 9 Amer Delic.
The players split the first two
sets, with each needing a
tiebreaker to win. But Hippen
steel proved why he is the top
player in the nation and im
proved his unbeaten singles
record to 10-0 with a nail-biting
6-2 victory in the third to take the
match, two sets to one.
Hippensteel was dominating

throughout the tournament, not
losing a singles match in any of the
four rounds. He also paired up
with Haviland as the seventh
ranked doubles team, which won
all four of its doubles matches.
Martin also made an incredi
ble run, winning all of his singles
matches and pairing up with No.
31 junior Scott Lipsky to capture
three out of their four double
contests. To top ii oil, Martin was
chosen by the 16 participating
coaches to receive (he USTA
Sportsmanship Award.
At the No. 5 singles spot, fresh
man Phil Sheng (5-5) struggled a
bit, losing two matches. 1 lis class
mate, No. 90 Sam Warburg (11-
6), went 2-1 in singles for the
tournament at the sixth spot. The
two also paired up as the Cardi
nal's third doubles team and
played well despite picking up
two losses in the tournament.
In the first round against San
Diego St., Hippensteel was un
able to finish his match against
No. 11 Oliver Maiberger, but the
Cardinal's three juniors, Martin,
Haviland and No. 31 Scott Lip
sky (14-7), carried the team to a
4-0 sweep over the Aztecs.
A surprisingly easy 6-1 win
over Duke in the quarterfinals on
Friday set up the Cardinal for its
4-2 win over the Trojans in Sat
urday's semifinal.
