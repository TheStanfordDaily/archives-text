# BSU holds black community forum
## Over 60 students discuss IHUM, black faculty 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Saturday morning, the Black
Student Union sponsored a
Black Community Forum, at
tracting over 60 students to dis
cuss issues affecting Stanford's
minority groups.
In addition to small group dis
cussions and panels of speakers,
the forum included icebreaker
activities, spoken word poetry,
singing and a cello performance.
Students discussed topics
such as insufficient funding for
the Black Community Services
Center, the lack of diversity re
flected in Introduction to Hu
manities courses, the need for
more tenured faculty of color
and the division between black
students residing on Fast and
West campus.

"The purpose of this event is
to bring out opportunities to
work on issues," sophomore
Donielle Newell, BSU co-chair,
said. "We're looking to mobilize
ourselves to work collaboratively
with other student efforts to
make changes in the areas of
IHUM, tenured faculty and
community centers."
Freshman Michael Brown 11,
a BSU member, decided to coor
dinate the forum while working
with the IHUM department to
create diverse courses more in
clusive of minority authors.
"I just [feel] that we, as a black
community, need to pursue
these problems," Brown said. "I
want this to be a long-lasting
event that does not die down.
Stanford promotes itself as a di
verse institution and should be
responsive to our concerns."
The BSU has held other
events in the past in an effort
to change aspects of Stanford,
but students lacked the conti
nuity of effort needed to make a
lasting impact.
"Change does not happen
quickly," Newell said. "The things
we want to change have long-term
gratification, and it is hard to main
tain the same passion and motiva
tion for the five or 10 years it takes
to do things.
"Instead, we should build off the
enthusiasm of newer members, in
stitutionalizing our efforts so they
can continue the work, utilizing the
knowledge of older members."
Newell indicated that the center

needs increased funding, support
and space for the functions it per
forms, including academic advice,
fundraising and community ser
vice support.
" The funding has not grown in
proportion to the growth of all the
programs and we do not have I he
space for all the programs, meet
ings and initiatives we have,"
Newell said, also noting that other
campus community centers have
faced the same problem.
Students also expressed con
cern over the lack of black tenured
faculty members as mentors and
researchers.
"The long-term goal is to have
the faculty mirror the student body,
though it is a very long-term goal,"

sophomore Tianna Terry said.
Students also felt that the loca
tion of Ujamaa, the black theme
dorm, on the West side of cam
pus makes it difficult for East
campus residents to participate
in activities.
One student commented that
since the black community only
comprises 7 percent of the popula
tion, this division creates a serious
problem at Stanford.
The forum concluded with a
look at the future, which partici
pants said they hoped would l>eone
of collaboration and continuity.
"I would like to be able to come
back and see the growth of this
community as an [alumnus]," se
nior Edjah Nduom said.
