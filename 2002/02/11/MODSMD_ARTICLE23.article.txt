# Former Enron chair Lay will plead fifth

WASHINGTON (AP)â€”Former Enron
chairman Kenneth Lay, scheduled to testify
under subpoena before Congress tomorrow,
will assert his right against self-incrimination
and refuse to answer questions, his spokes
woman said.
"Under the instruction of counsel, Mr.
Lay will exercise his Fifth Amendment tights
at the Tuesday hearing," Kelly Kimberly said
in Houston.
Two committees snubbed by Lay a week
ago have issued subpoenas compelling him
to appear.
"We will be respectful but tough," in ques
tioning Lay, Sen. Byron Dorgan, 13-N.D.,chair
man of a Senate Commerce panel on consumer
affairs had told CNN.
Lay's colleague at Enron, former chief exec
utive Jeffrey Skilling, did testify last week.
But a number of leaders of Congress' in
vestigations of the Enron collapse said earlier

Sunday that they didn't believe the sworn tes
timony of Skilling. One suggested Skilling
could face accusations of perjury as a result of
his testimony.
After an intense week of hearings, lawmak
ers say they have strong evidence of illegal ac
tivity surrounding the failure of the energy
trading company, which slid into the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2.
A 1 louse investigative panel heard hours of
conflicting testimony Thursday from Skilling
and other top company officials. Skilling said
he knew few details of the complex web of part
nerships that brought down Enron, and he in
sisted he was never warned of problems with
the arrangements.
"He was totally incredible," said Rep. Billy
lau/.in, R-La., "This is the guy who was in
charge of the corporation. I'm afraid he may
have put himself in some legal jeopardy as a
result."

Asked whether Skilling could face a perjury
indictment by federal prosecutors, Tauzin
replied, "That could happen. I mean,you can't
come to Congress ... take that oath as he did in
front of Jim Greenwood, and then not tell the
truth."
Skilling's attorney, Bruce Hiler, said later he
was "shocked at the unsupported charges
being leveled at our client."
Some Democrats highlighted the political
dimensions of the Enron collapse. Lawmakers
of both parties said they hoped the debacle
would give a boost to legislation before the
House this week designed to curb money's in
fluence on federal elections.
"Ken Lay is the poster child for cash-and
carry government," Senate Commerce Com
mittee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said
on CBS' "Face the Nation."
He cited Enron's ties with several Bush ad
ministration officials.
