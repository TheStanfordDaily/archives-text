### ANNA GALAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Activist and author Randall
Robinson addressed the relation
ship between slavery and current
socio-economic issues facing
African-Americans in a speech Fri
day at the Stanford Bookstore. The
event was planned jointly by the
African and African-American
Studies Department and the Book
store. Robinson, author of "The
Debt," "Defending the Spirit" and
"The Reckoning," signed his books
immediately following (he lecture.
In his speech, Robinson
warned against the recent trend
toward private prisons and the re
lationship between politics and
corporate interests. He also dis
cussed what he saw as the need for
reparations for slavery in the form
of government programs.
Robinson discussed how many

of the current issues facing African
-Americans stem from the period
of slavery.
According to Robinson, the
reason for economic disparity
between blacks and whites is that
the government expects blacks
to be able to "catch up" econom
ically, since crimes such as slav
ery are no longer committed
against them.
"The worst crime yon can com
mit against a people is to rob them
of their story of themselves,"
Robinson said. "Most of us can't
recall anything about any world
before we arrived in America. It is
a devastating blow. You've lost
your language, you've lost your
religion, your whole culture and
you've lost your memory."
Robinson discussed the need
fora governmental response to
these issues.
"If we're talking about closing

the gap in America, then we would
have to take some measures to re
pair the damage," he said, "lie
cause when a government com
mits a crime against humanity,
particularly one as long as
this , . . then programs have to be
put in place to repair."
Robinson also talked about the
need to change the system that has
brought about the incarceration
of so many blacks, citing that the
United States has one-twentieth of
the world's population, but one
fourth of the world's prisons.
According to Robinson, the
corporate money involved in
building private prisons, along
with new legislation, is creating
"an enormous, burgeoning crop
of prisoners" without any place to
put them.

Robinson encouraged civic

come from Washington,"he said.
