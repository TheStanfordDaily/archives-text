The senior class presidents will
announce today that National Se
curity Advisor and former provost
Condoleezza Rice will speak at this
year's Commencement.
After an extensive online
nomination process that took
place at the beginning of fall
quarter, senior class presidents
Tai-Li Chang, Shiao Chien,
Serge Kassardjian and Nicholas
Larson recommended Rice to
University President John Hen
nessy, along with 24 other candi
dates, including such figures as
President George W. Bush, Tony
Blair, Nelson Mandela, Maya
Angelou, Salman Rushdie and
the Dalai Lama.
Hennessy consulted with the
Board of Trustees to select Rice
from the list of nominees.
"This is an inspired recom
mendation and it gives me great
pleasure to accept it," Hennessy
said. "Professor Rice is not only
someone who has a central place
on the world stage, she has a
long-standing relationship with
the University and a deep loyalty
to its students, faculty and staff."
Rice joined the Stanford facul

ty in 1981 and was appointed
provost in 1993. After 18 years at
the University, she left in 1999, at
the end of this year's senior class's
freshman year.
Rice has since gone on to be
came the assistant to the presi
dent for national security
affairs â€” commonly referred to
as the national security advisor.
Kassardjian said that the class
presidents were extremely
pleased that Rice accepted the
invitation to deliver the Com
mencement address.
"The events of [Sept. 11] will
forever frame our senior year,"
Kassardjian said. "We wanted a
speaker who would be able to talk
about that day with authority and
perspective. We can think of no
better way to end the year than
with the observations and advice
of a leader who figures so promi
nently in confronting the issues
of our time."
Larson agreed.
"We are the first Stanford class
to graduate after the tragic events
took place and our world was re
shaped," Larson said. "Condi's

al security advisor place her in an
excellent position to share with us
her thoughts about [Sept. 11 ] and
the ever-changing world in front
of us."
Larson also mentioned Rice's
achievements during her time
as provost.
"We know that she is a great
speaker because we were wel
comed by her in 1998 as outgo
ing provost," Larson said. "Her
last year here was our first and
we were able to get to know her
and her amazing talents during
that year."
"Her achievements and great
warmth made a tremendous im
pression on us," Larson added.
"The profound events of the last

live months have made it clear
thai we are not alone in the pride
we take in her leadership."
Senior Max Spevack said that
the class presidents and Hennessy
have made an "excellent decision."
"Not only is she an eminent
national figure, but she is well
loved by the Stanford communi
ty," Spevat k said. "1 don't think
you could linda better person
for Stanford, in terms of connec
tion to the University and na
tional prominence."
Rice's colleagues agreed.
" There is nobody more firm
ly identified with Stanford or
someone who knows and cham
pions her Stanford affiliations,"
said Michael McFaul, a re
search fellow at the Hoover In
stitution and assistant professor
of political science. "So given
the times, it would be hard for
me to think of a more appropri

ate speaker for Commence
ment than Condi Rice."
"My expectation is that she
would do an excellent job," said
Economics Prof. Roger Noll.
Noll acknowledged that the
selection of such a politically
visible figure may be controver
sial, but maintained that Rice is
"a great choice."
"I hope everyone [will] wel
come her warmly and treat her
with respect," Noll said.
"It should be fascinating," said
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution who has
known Rice for several years.
"Most Commencement speeches
aren't that memorable, but this is
one I'll come to."
Stanford's 11 lib Commence
ment will be held on Sunday,
June 16, and is estimated to at
tract 25,000 graduates and family
members to Stanford Stadium.
