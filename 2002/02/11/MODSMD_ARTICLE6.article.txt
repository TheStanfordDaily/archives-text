# Experts discuss sex, gender
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Scientists and humanists con
vened Friday and Saturday to dis
cuss their different approaches to
what has become an ambiguous
concept: gender.
Organized by the Stanford Hu
manities Center, "The Persistence
of Gender" featured lectures by
professors, researchers and ac
tivists on topics including pornog
raphy in popular culture and the
meaning of intersex, a term used
to describe people born with both
male and female reproductive or
gans. Ultimately, participants

hoped to move away from "useful
simplifications" made regarding
gender and explore the greater
complexity of the term.
In the pamphlet distributed at
the conference, organizers identi
fied a variety of different contexts
in which gender is considered and
how these related to the confer
ence's theme.
"The stress of this conference is
on the physical, on the somatic as
pects of life, on pleasure and pain,
on the use of technology to couple
the body to machines and the mar
ket," read the pamphlet.
Participants viewed the confer
ence not only as an opportunity to

discuss the issues surrounding gen
der but also as a chance to see how
other fields approach the topic.
"112 think the overall [goal wasj to
talk about the uses of the term
"gender" — its usefulness, the
problems with it, the very different
ways it's used across disciplines,"
said UC-Berkeley film theorist
Constance Penley.
Michael Moore, a behavioral
scientist from Arizona State Uni
versity, emphasized the impor
tance of the dialogue the confer
ence produced.
"It's been a real opportunity to
look at my work and the work of
other people in a different way,"
he said.
On Friday, live speakers — a
techno-humanist, a behavioral
scientist, an ethologist, a cultural
analyst and a patient advo
cate — presented lectures, some
addressing the inadequacy of
treating gender as a dichoto
mous entity.
Techno-humanist Anne Bal
samo gave a speech entitled, "Gen
dering the Technological Imagi
nation: Feminism in Unlikely
Places," which was followed by
Moore's discussion on behavior
within and between genders.
Paul Vasey, an ethologist from
the University of Lethbridge,
England, discussed his research
on homosexual habits of female
Japanese macaques.
Jennifer Terry of Ohio State
University gave a talk entitled
"Sexing the Menagerie" and
Cheryl Chase of the Intersex So
ciety of North America dis

cussed "why intersex is not
about gender."
Penley and /Mice Dreger, a his
torian-ethicist from Michigan
State University, also gave talks on
pornography as male popular cul
ture and the persistence of inter
sex, respectively.
The conference concluded
with smaller discussions and a
roundtable talk with speakers
and observers.
Joan Roughgarden, professor
of biological sciences and geo
physics and chair of the Commit
tee on Cultural and Biological Di
versity, was selected by a steering
committee to organize the confer
ence. Roughgarden stressed the
uniqueness of the conference in
that it bridged the gap between the
humanities and sciences.
"It has begun a conversation
between people who rarely get to
come together and talk about is
sues of interest to them," she said.
Penley agreed.
"We found some extraordinary
commonalities," she said. "And
some real commonalities in our
desire for ... the research that we
do to have some kind of public pol
icy consequences."
