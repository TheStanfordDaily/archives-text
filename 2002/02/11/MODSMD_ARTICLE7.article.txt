There might be four games left, and the entire Pa
cific 10 Conference tourney yet to play, but the Stan
ford women have already achieved their first goal —
a regular season Pac-10 title.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford 89, Oregon State 67

After the No. 2 Cardinal (24-1, 14-0 Pac-10) domi
nated Oregon State (13-12, 9-6) in Gill Coliseum Sat
inday, beating the Beavers 89-67, it assured itself at
least a share of the conference title.
Saturday's win avenged last year's 81-65 loss at
Oregon State, and along with Thursday's victory over
Oregon, completed a clean sweep at the Oregon
schools for the first time since 1998 season.
The Beavers suffered a hard loss at Stanford back
in January and were looking for revenge in Corvallis,
but got none.
The Cardinal jumped out early, running the score
up to 32-12 after forcing the Beavers into a scoring
drought that lasted nearly seven minutes.
A variety of strategies — including full-court pres
sure, half-court zone and the team's aggressive man
to-man coverage — characterized Stanford's impres
sive defensive efforts. Stanford kept Pac-10-leading
scorer Felicia Ragland to just 12 points, well below her
20-plus average.
On the other end of the court, the strength of the
Cardinal's offensive talents was painfully evident to the
Beavers. Stanford headed into halftime ahead 40-21,
shooting 16-of-32 in the first half with six three-pointers.
Even with the 19-point lead, Stanford continued
to play its game in the second half, sealing the win
