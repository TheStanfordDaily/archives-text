### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
There might be four games left, and the entire Pa
cific 10 Conference tourney yet to play, but the Stan
ford women have already achieved their first goal —
a regular season Pac-10 title.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford 89, Oregon State 67

After the No. 2 Cardinal (24-1, 14-0 Pac-10) domi
nated Oregon State (13-12, 9-6) in Gill Coliseum Sat
inday, beating the Beavers 89-67, it assured itself at
least a share of the conference title.
Saturday's win avenged last year's 81-65 loss at
Oregon State, and along with Thursday's victory over
Oregon, completed a clean sweep at the Oregon
schools for the first time since 1998 season.
The Beavers suffered a hard loss at Stanford back
in January and were looking for revenge in Corvallis,
but got none.
The Cardinal jumped out early, running the score
up to 32-12 after forcing the Beavers into a scoring
drought that lasted nearly seven minutes.
A variety of strategies — including full-court pres
sure, half-court zone and the team's aggressive man
to-man coverage — characterized Stanford's impres
sive defensive efforts. Stanford kept Pac-10-leading
scorer Felicia Ragland to just 12 points, well below her
20-plus average.
On the other end of the court, the strength of the
Cardinal's offensive talents was painfully evident to the
Beavers. Stanford headed into halftime ahead 40-21,
shooting 16-of-32 in the first half with six three-pointers.
Even with the 19-point lead, Stanford continued
to play its game in the second half, sealing the win

with a 17-0 run to push the score
to 65-28. The Cardinal put on a
shooting display during the run,
nailing seven of eight shots in
cluding two three-pointers.
The team continued to pound
the ball inside and shoot on the
perimeter as Stanford head
Coach Tara VanDerveer cleared
the bench.
Oregon State could do little
more than watch as Stanford put
on a basketball c linic for fans and
foes alike.

"We tried all of our defenses,
and it didn't matter what we were
playing," said Oregon State coach
Judy Spoelstra.
Beavers guard Juleen Smith
led her team with 18 points but
was just as frustrated with the
game's direction.
"We weren't getting out on
their 3-point shooters," Smith
said. "We just let them come
out and shoot, and they
weren't missing."
Stanford made 10 three-point
shots on Saturday with the prolif
ic offensive duo of sophomore
forward Nicole Powell and senior
guard Lindsey Yamasaki claim
ing responsibility for seven of

those shots.
Powell led all scorers with 23
points and nonchalantly
chalked up her eighth double
double of the season by collect
ing 11 rebounds. In what has
also become Powell's norm, she
flirted with a triple-double after
dishing out seven assists in 31
minutes of play.
Yamasaki knocked in four
three-pointers on her way to scor
ing 14 points in her home state.
Her efforts helped the team
ac hieve a .541 shooting percent
age for the night.
The balance in Stanford's
scoring showcased the depth
that makes this Cardinal squad

so dangerous.
Besides Powell and Yamasaki,
senior center Bethany Donaphin
and freshman forward T'Nae
rhiel both scored in double digits
with 1 1 points each. All but one
Stanford player put the ball
through the hoop on Saturday.
While the Cardinal secured at
least a share of the regular sea
son conference title, it still has to
lace Washington, who is second
in the Pac-10. Stanford will also
make a return trip to Oregon in
a few weeks for the inaugural
Pac-10 Tournament.
"We can't celebrate because
you've got to turn around and play
the tournament," VanDerveer said.

Oregon State, and along with Thursday's victory over
Oregon, completed a clean sweep at the Oregon
schools for the first time since 1998 season.
The Beavers suffered a hard loss at Stanford back
in January and were looking for revenge in Corvallis,
but got none.
The Cardinal jumped out early, running the score
up to 32-12 after forcing the Beavers into a scoring
drought that lasted nearly seven minutes.
A variety of strategies — including full-court pres
sure, half-court zone and the team's aggressive man
to-man coverage — characterized Stanford's impres
sive defensive efforts. Stanford kept Pac-10-leading
scorer Felicia Ragland to just 12 points, well below her
20-plus average.
On the other end of the court, the strength of the
Cardinal's offensive talents was painfully evident to the
Beavers. Stanford headed into halftime ahead 40-21,
shooting 16-of-32 in the first half with six three-pointers.
Even with the 19-point lead, Stanford continued
to play its game in the second half, sealing the win

with 23 points and 11 rebounds in No. 2 Stanford's 89-
67 win at Oregon State on Saturday.
with a 17-0 run to push the score
to 65-28. The Cardinal put on a
shooting display during the run,
nailing seven of eight shots in
cluding two three-pointers.
The team continued to pound
the ball inside and shoot on the
perimeter as Stanford head
Coach Tara VanDerveer cleared
the bench.
Oregon State could do little
more than watch as Stanford put
on a basketball c linic for fans and
foes alike.

"We tried all of our defenses,
and it didn't matter what we were
playing," said Oregon State coach
Judy Spoelstra.
Beavers guard Juleen Smith
led her team with 18 points but
was just as frustrated with the
game's direction.
"We weren't getting out on
their 3-point shooters," Smith
said. "We just let them come
out and shoot, and they
weren't missing."
Stanford made 10 three-point
shots on Saturday with the prolif
ic offensive duo of sophomore
forward Nicole Powell and senior
guard Lindsey Yamasaki claim
ing responsibility for seven of

those shots.
Powell led all scorers with 23
points and nonchalantly
chalked up her eighth double
double of the season by collect
ing 11 rebounds. In what has
also become Powell's norm, she
flirted with a triple-double after
dishing out seven assists in 31
minutes of play.
Yamasaki knocked in four
three-pointers on her way to scor
ing 14 points in her home state.
Her efforts helped the team
ac hieve a .541 shooting percent
age for the night.
The balance in Stanford's
scoring showcased the depth
that makes this Cardinal squad

so dangerous.
Besides Powell and Yamasaki,
senior center Bethany Donaphin
and freshman forward T'Nae
rhiel both scored in double digits
with 1 1 points each. All but one
Stanford player put the ball
through the hoop on Saturday.
While the Cardinal secured at
least a share of the regular sea
son conference title, it still has to
lace Washington, who is second
in the Pac-10. Stanford will also
make a return trip to Oregon in
a few weeks for the inaugural
Pac-10 Tournament.
"We can't celebrate because
you've got to turn around and play
the tournament," VanDerveer said.
