The Stanford S<xiety of Women
Engineers hosted its annual Junior
Engineering Technical Society Day
for Northern California high
school students Saturday in the
Manzanita dining hall. Led by
Stanford faculty coaches, 25 teams
of four to eight students worked to
gether to solve problems related to
engineering, mathematics, science
and technology. Students tackled a
variety of issues, including some re
lated to nuclear reactor plants and
others to yogurt factories.
Students from nine high
schools — California, Cupertino,
Foothill, Harker, Leland, Monte
Vista, Pinewood, Winters and
York — competed for regional,
state and national awards. In ad
dition, the students had the
chance to win raffle prizes donat
ed by several high-tech compa
nies, including laser pointers and
a Microsoft X-Box.
"Our JETS Day competition is
a great way for the high school
students to test their problem
solving abilities while building
teamwork skills," said sophomore
Meredith Lee, society co-chair of
high school outreach. "All the en
ergy that [the society] dedicates to
hosting the event definitely pays
off when we see how much the

students enjoy tackling these chal
lenging problems."
"I did JETS in high school, so 1
wanted to be on the other side and
see how they organized it," fresh
man Karen Law said. "1 miss doing
the problems. It's different on the
college side because yon don't
freak out about the same kinds of
things, but it's very reminiscent."
Some younger participants
found the test quite challenging.
"It was really good for team
work, but I don't think it was
meant for freshmen," said Saman
tha Nicoll, a freshman at Foothill
High School.
Overall, the response from stu

dents was very enthusiastic.
"I like science a lot, so it made
sense to come and do an engineer
ing event, and it's a lot of fun," said
Ashley Berry, a senior at York
High School.
Across the nation, more than
20,000 high school students and
teachers participate in JETS Day
each year, held at universities
throughout the country. Society
members plan the local event as
part of their high school out
reach program.
The society solicited donations
and received grants from compa
nies such as Adobe, Microsoft, Infi
neon, IBM and Capital One.
