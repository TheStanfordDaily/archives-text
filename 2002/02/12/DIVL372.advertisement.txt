"How ! Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to
explore the nuts and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing, while content
is always an issue, the conversation will primarily focus on worlc styles, such as where,
when, and how a writer composes, allowing us to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, tech
niques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and hidden delights. We will discuss how a
writer generates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composi
tion, overcomes various impediments and bloclcs, and cultivates stylistic innovations.
Writing communities share experiences (even bad ones), so that all writers can learn
and grow, and Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights.
Join the conversation, and discover how these distinguished faculty write.^^jpP^^
