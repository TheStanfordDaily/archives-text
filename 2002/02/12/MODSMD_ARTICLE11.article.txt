1935
On Feb. 12, 1935, The Daily printed an
article about a student- and faculty- initiated
effort to increase campus understanding of
communism and fascism.
"Students and faculty spokesmen joined
last night in favorable reaction to a student
proposed project of an all-University pro
gram for the campus in discussion of cur
rent trends of political thought.
"Complete presentation of the philoso
phies of communism and fascism was asked
by a group of students who communicated
their opinions to The Daily, with the idea of
having Stanford take a lead in maintaining
academic freedom.
"Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur feels that such a
discussion would prove quite acceptable if a
satisfactory program could be well worked
out in advance, with an intelligent presenta
tion of these topics.
"Economics Professor Theodore Boggs
feels such a discussion would be a good
thing is properly sponsored, so that students
might form a more intelligent opinion of the
meaning of fascism and communism. . . .
"A well-planned university program or
programs on current political philosophies
would be backed up by general student inter
est and bear administration endorsement."
Bottom Line: Student-proposed projects of yes
teryear are student-initiated courses of today â€”
the politics have changed, but the desire to un
derstand hasn't.
