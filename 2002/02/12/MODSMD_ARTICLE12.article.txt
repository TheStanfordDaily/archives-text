Australia has an important re
gional role to play in the war against
terrorism, a leading U.S. political sci
entist said today.
Stanford University Political Sci
ence and Sociology Professor Larry
Diamond said the war against terror
ism could not be won by force alone.
"We have to rob the new Bolshe
viks, and that's what I think they are,
masquerading as religious warriors,
of the popular support, political sym
pathy, state sponsorship that they
need to threaten civilised societies,"
he said today at the U.S. Consulate
General in Sydney.
Dr. Diamond, who gave a talk at
the Consulate, said this would be done
by winning the war of ideas as was
done during the Cold War, doing more
to address the ongoing conflict in the
Middle East and attacking the root of
much of the cause of terrorism.
