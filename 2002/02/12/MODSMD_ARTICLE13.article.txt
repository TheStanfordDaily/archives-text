# How does anesthesia work?
## BITS & BYTES

Anyone who has had an operation has likely
heard the doctor say that "it will be painless" as he
places an injection—and it really is painless, due to
the miracle of anesthesia. Since its first use in 18-46,
anesthesia has become standard in modern medi
cine. Every year, 27 million Americans benefit from
its effects.
Nonetheless, scientists are still not certain how it

works. Lambert and
colleagues at the
University of
Dundee in Scotland
claim that it func
tions via GABA, the
brain's major in
hibitory neuro
transmitter.

According to research, frog eggs whose GABA
receptors had undergone mutations resulted in
frogs that were unresponsive to anesthesia. Evi
dence supporting this discovery shows that neuros
teroids, which also operate through GABA recep
tors, can induce sleep and analgesic effects.
Astronomer David Charbonneau and colleagues
used the Hubble telescope to detect the HD 209458
star, which is outside the Solar System but has an at
mosphere similar to Earth's.
A Jupiter-sized planet periodically crosses in
front of the star, blocking some of its light. As
tronomers found that the dimming is 0.02 percent

stronger at a distance
of 590 nanometers,
revealing a wave
length correlated
with sodium. t
Although the gas
giant is unlikely to
hold any life, these
techniques could

eventually be used to detect Earth-like atmospheres
and life. I
The acquisition of symbolic language is essential

to human cognitive abilities. Increasing evidence in
dicates that language has evolved over an excep
tionally long period of time.
Scientists at Emory University examined "Bord
mann's area 44," a part of the brain that is critical for
speech functions, and is asymmetrically distributed
between the lei t and right hemispheres of the brain.
A study proved that this asymmetry occurs not only
in humans but also in ancestors of ours such as chim-

panzees and gorillas.
The finding indi
cates that the brain's
capacity for lan
guage was already
developed at the pri
mate stage of evolu
tion. Researchers
have also found that
humans had devel-

oped modern vocal tracts more than 500,000 years
before they began articulating words.
Newton's second law of motion states that a body
at rest tends to remain at rest. Two scientists from
the University of Chicago have used this principle
to study people's television-watching habits.
They found that television causes an addiction
in much the same way as coffee or cigarettes,
fhey analyzed people's responses and brain pat
terns before, during and after watching televi
sion. Those who watched infrequently reported
feeling rested, while couch potatos reported anx
iety and the need to watch more television before
feeling rested.
Brain patterns also indicated a decrease in alert
ness as the individual watched more television. Re
searchers found similar results for the effects of
video games and the Internet.
Madagascar, the fourth-largest island in the
world, is famous for its 40 species of lemur and
other varieties of flora and fauna unique to its terri
tory. Presumably, this results from the fact that the
island has not been connected to any major land
mass for more than 90 million years.
Surprisingly, Madagascar's unique species are
more closely related to continental African species
than to fossils unearthed in Madagascar. Scientists
claim that species migrated across the sea from the
continent to Madagascar, and took a separate evo
lutionary course upon arrival.
DNA analyses are currently verifying whether
this movement took place in a single episode or
over multiple episodes of migration.
