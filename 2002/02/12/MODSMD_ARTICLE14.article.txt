## The 						Stanford Daily Dean of Students should heed Greek Judicial Board 
### 
Published Since 1891

The Dean of Students' office says
that what makes Stanford's Greek
discipline process unique is that
there is student input in the sys
tem. Ideally, Greek justice on campus would
function as an educational process, which
would, as Nanci Howe, assistant dean of stu
dents said, seek to "identify ways to correct
the problem and strengthen the chapters."
But when the Dean of Students' office does
not follow the recommendation of the Greek
Judicial Board, which is comprised of a dual
committee of nine students, Stanford's sys
tem of student-involvement in the Greek dis
cipline process is called into question.
The dean is certainly entitled to adopt,
amend or reject the recommendations of the
Greek Judicial Board, but as students, we

trust that he will follow the recommenda
tions given in good conscience by this group
of concerned students. In the case of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity, this was not the case.
Dean of Students Marc Wais charged the
group with a list of infractions that went be
fore the Greek Judicial Board late last spring.
The board did not reach a decision until last
November. But in the interim, the fraternity
was not permitted to have any social events
involving alcohol.
The Greek Judicial Board recommended
one quarter of alcohol probation, which includ
ed time already served. The reason behind this
decision, provided by Steph Cheung, co-chair
of the board, was that "The Board was very con
cerned about the impact such severe sanctions
would have on the fraternity as a whole."

But Wais added one additional quarter of
alcohol probation based on his opinion the
severity of the violations.
Certainly some sanctions were warrant
ed. Kappa Sig was in violation of fire codes
during an all-campus party. In addition, it
had violated the alcohol policy. These in
fractions are serious and deserve repri
mand, but we feel that Wais went too far.
The Greek Judicial Board is in a unique
position to understand the role of fraternities
in campus life. The board felt strongly that
severe punishment would adversely affect
this fraternity. Wais should have heeded this
recommendation, or he should have added
other, less severe sanctions if he felt more
punishment was deserved.
Instead, we believe that a tiered system of

punishment and rehabilitation is more appro
priate to a learning environment. The one
quarter of alcohol probation recommended by
the Greek Judicial Board was fair, and could
have been followed by a less stringent supervi
sory period. This move would have allowed
the fraternity to reintegrate itself into the cam
pus social scene in a gradual and safe manner.
The student members of the committee
carefully weighed the interests of the frater
nity and the safety of fraternity members and
the student population as a whole before
coming to their decision. If the Dean's office
consistently and drastically modifies the rec
ommendations of the student advisory com
mittee, the Greek Judicial Board will become
just a puppet organization without any real
reason for existence.
