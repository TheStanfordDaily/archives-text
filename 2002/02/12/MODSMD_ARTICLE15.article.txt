# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## A
						teachable moment: Stanford and Nike 
### RUSH REHM GUEST COLUMNIST 
This past summer Stanford signed
a new contract with Nike, Inc. re
quiring Nike to provide athletic
gear (shoes, jerseys, caps, socks,
shorts, sweats, sweat bands, etc.) free to the
Stanford Athletic Department to outfit
Stanford athletes and coaches. Under the
aegis of the Athletic Department, Stanford
athletes advertise Nike products on their
bodies. Although details are not public, the
deal purportedly is worth $2 million annu
ally, and extends for several years.
What could be wrong with that? It's the
proverbial "win-win" situation. Nike wins
Stanford wins, no need to keep score.
Tomorrow night, the Stanford com
munity can learn what's missing in that
happy scenario. At 7:00 p.m. in Meyer
Forum Room, two exceptional athletes
and extraordinary human beings will
share their knowledge and experience
about those who lose in this game.
Jim Ready, former college soccer star
and assistant soccer coach at St. John's
University, and Leslie Kretzu, recent
Olympic torchbearer, will speak about
the workers in Third World countries
who assemble those goods that Stanford
coaches and athletes wear and advertise
and that Stanford and Nike sell as li
censed Stanford products.
Keady and Kretzu know the story first
hand. After excelling in soccer at St. Joseph's
College, and playing semipro soccer in New
Jersey, Keady went to St. John's University
to pursue a master's in theology and serve
as goalie coach for the soccer team.
In a course on ethics aijd society,
Keady's teacher (a Jesuit priest) suggested
he look into the university and ethics.
Being an athlete, Keady focused on athlet
ic shoe manufacturers and university ath
letic departments.
When St. John's signed a contract with
Nike later that year, Keady knew some
thing about the exploitation of Nike work
ers, and he refused to wear the mandated
swoosh. I le was fired.
So he and Kretzu started a non-profit
organization called Educating for Change.
They applied to Nike to work in one of
their sub-contracted assembly plants, to
see if what Jim had found out on paper was
true on the ground. Nike refused.
So Keady and Kretzu did the next best
thing. They went to langerang, Indone
sia, to live with Nike assembly workers, on
the same wage and in the same circum
stances, but without the grueling work.
In a month, Keady lost 25 pounds. As he
noted in his journal, "I almost passed out
from hunger today. I live on a Nike sweat
shop wage. I here is nothing else to write."
What about these workers for Nike in
l angerang, Indonesia? They are paid
17 cents an hour, and they work forced
overtime, usually six days a week. They
live by toxic waste pits from Nike assem

bly plants, without running water and
basic amenities.
Most of these workers are young
women, whose heads can bend longer
over the sewing machines, whose fingers
work faster, and for whom the debilitat
ing arthritis shows up later, perhaps
after the assembly plant has been closed,
the work moved to an even more des
perate location, with even lower
wages â€” a "race to the bottom."
In Tangerang, and throughout In
donesia (over 11 (),()()() workers assemble
Nike products there), young Muslim
women are frequently harassed by their
non-Indonesian male employers, usual
ly Korean or Taiwanese. Nike sub-con
tracts all its assembly work to such off
shore firms, who find the cheapest and
most docile labor markets in order to
maximize their own take. The workers
need the jobs, but they also want decent
treatment and a fair wage.
But what power do they have in this
game of exploitation, that eats them up
and spits them out, while Nike CEO Phil
Knight makes billions, and Stanford
profits from their exploitation?
Last year other faculty members and I
raised this issue in the University Faculty
Senate. As some pointed out, the expira
tion of the old Nike contract provided a
"teachable moment," a chance for the
University to reconsider its position, to
learn about the issues and to think
through its responsibilities.
While they listened, the administra
tion was busy negotiating a more lucra
tive deal with Nike. In all our discus
sions, no administration or Athletic De
partment official ever responded to the
working conditions and exploitative
wages paid to Nike workers, who pro
vide the goods that Stanford has con
tracted to advertise. No one in the ad
ministration or Athletic department can
fell, you where, and under what condi
tions, Stanford's Nike gear is made. The
administration refuses even to consider
joining the Workers' Rights Consortium,
a group of over 70 universities (includ
ing schools like Notre Dame) who moni
tor conditions at factories where their
sporting apparel is assembled.
Tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. in the
Meyer Forum Room, two former student
athletes will tell us what's wrong with
Stanford's position, and what's wrong
with Nike's labor practices. They know
from first hand experience, and they pre
sent us with another teachable moment.
Maybe Keady and Kretzu can help us
learn something and inspire us to act on
what we know.
Come, ask questions, Find out what you
can. Isn't that what a university is for? Or do
we just take the money, wear the swoosh,
and tiilk about everybody winning?
