Junior responds to tuition increase .
I am writing in response to Wendelin
Wright's critique of Meghana Reddy's
letter to the editor, Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 re
spectively. Before Wright makes state
ments like "Reddy should be ashamed of
her baseless attack," I'd urge her to ana
lyze Reddy's letter more carefully, for
Wright's letter suffers from several logi
cal fallacies.
First, Wright falls for the 'straw man'
fallacy part of the 'missing the point' cat
egory of logical fallacies. Her letter pur
ports to refute Reddy's points, but in fact
does not do so. Fit her she did not com
prehend Reddy's subtleties or was inten
tionally misleading.
On Feb. 6, The Daily wrote, "Accord
ing to the Trustees, the hike reflects
Stanford's commitment to admitting stu
dents regardless of their ability to pay."
Reddy then refutes this point, essen
tially saying that this gives a 'false dilem
ma.' A false dilemma is when two options
are given, but in reality there are a lot
more. The Trustees are implying (at
least the way it was reported in The
Daily) the choice was between raising tu
ition and keeping the commitment to
need-blind admissions or maintaining
the current tuition but reducing the
commitment to need-blind admissions.
Reddy argues that this was a false
dilemma, saying that there were not two
options but several more. She introduces
her new choice as extravagant spending.
She argues (or implies) that the uni
versity could do any of the following:
first, cut extravagant spending, keep
tuition the same, and make a commit
ment to need-blind admissions; sec
ond, keep extravagant spending, raise
tuition, and make commitment to
need-blind admissions; or third, keep
extravagant spending, raise tuition, re
duce commitment to need-blind policy.
There are, of c ourse, more options but

for simplicity's sake, I'll stop here.
Her attack on the University is for pre
senting a false dilemma, where the Uni
versity presents the choice between need
blind admissions or tuition hikes but in
reality there are more variables, includ
ing Reddy's variable of opulent spending
(palm trees, extravagant buildings, etc).
She then criticizes the use of this false
dilemma, as it divides the student body.
Thus Reddy's "attack" on the Board
was for presenting a false dilemma, not
for raising tuition. Wright, however, ar
gues about the necessity of a tuition hike
and does not even address Reddy's point.
While Wright's letter did have merits on
its own, it missed the entire point in cri
tiquing Reddy's letter. To have effectively
critiqued Reddy's letter, Wright would
have had to argue that there was no false
dilemma, that the University was actually
faced with only two choices (raising tuition
or decreasing commitment to need-blind).
Ms. Wright, however, did not do so;
while she dug up numbers to show that
she did research, none of them coun
tered Reddy's point.
Wright's concluding line, "Reddy
should be ashamed of her baseless attack,"
was highly inappropriate and flawed; it is
not Reddy who ought to be ashamed.

speaker choice
As most of you know, our graduation
speaker was announced today: National
Security Adviser and former Provost Con
doleezza Rice was chosen by University
President Hennessy after consultation
with the senior class. While I applaud
these efforts to choose a relevant figure, 1
object strongly to the choice of Rice.
I am personally extremely opposed to
the U.S. actions in Afghanistan; killing

Afghani civilians and propping up a cor
rupt government does not honor the
memory of our murdered civilians.
Additionally, the Bush administra
tion's attacks on freedoms guaranteed by
the Bill of Rights are unconstitutional
and dangerous. Racial profiling should
not be tolerated.
While President George W. Bush's
approval ratings remain high, 1 prefer to
live by the words of Henry David Thore
au: "Any man more right than his neigh
bors constitutes a majority of one."
It is my opinion that the role of a
University in the time of conflict is to
serve as a conscience and watchdog for
the government, and I feel that the
choice of Condoleezza Rice undermines
this important role.
1 herefore, 1 propose that we who are
opposed to the actions of the government
use Wacky Walk, traditionally a time for
self-expression, as a non-disruptive
protest ol the war and the accompanying
attacks on civil liberties.
While disrupting graduation would be
entirely inappropriate, I leel that this is
our opportunity to stand for what we be
lieve. If enough of us band together, we
can show the parents in attendance as well
as the news media that we do not support
the murder of innocent civilians or the de
struction of our civil liberties.

ing Reddy's variable of opulent spending
(palm trees, extravagant buildings, etc).
She then criticizes the use of this false
dilemma, as it divides the student body.
Thus Reddy's "attack" on the Board
was for presenting a false dilemma, not
for raising tuition. Wright, however, ar
gues about the necessity of a tuition hike
and does not even address Reddy's point.
While Wright's letter did have merits on
its own, it missed the entire point in cri
tiquing Reddy's letter. To have effectively
critiqued Reddy's letter, Wright would
have had to argue that there was no false
dilemma, that the University was actually
faced with only two choices (raising tuition
or decreasing commitment to need-blind).
Ms. Wright, however, did not do so;
while she dug up numbers to show that
she did research, none of them coun
tered Reddy's point.
Wright's concluding line, "Reddy
should be ashamed of her baseless attack,"
was highly inappropriate and flawed; it is
not Reddy who ought to be ashamed.

Students should protest graduation
speaker choice
As most of you know, our graduation
speaker was announced today: National
Security Adviser and former Provost Con
doleezza Rice was chosen by University
President Hennessy after consultation
with the senior class. While I applaud
these efforts to choose a relevant figure, 1
object strongly to the choice of Rice.
I am personally extremely opposed to
the U.S. actions in Afghanistan; killing

Afghani civilians and propping up a cor
rupt government does not honor the
memory of our murdered civilians.
Additionally, the Bush administra
tion's attacks on freedoms guaranteed by
the Bill of Rights are unconstitutional
and dangerous. Racial profiling should
not be tolerated.
While President George W. Bush's
approval ratings remain high, 1 prefer to
live by the words of Henry David Thore
au: "Any man more right than his neigh
bors constitutes a majority of one."
It is my opinion that the role of a
University in the time of conflict is to
serve as a conscience and watchdog for
the government, and I feel that the
choice of Condoleezza Rice undermines
this important role.
1 herefore, 1 propose that we who are
opposed to the actions of the government
use Wacky Walk, traditionally a time for
self-expression, as a non-disruptive
protest ol the war and the accompanying
attacks on civil liberties.
While disrupting graduation would be
entirely inappropriate, I leel that this is
our opportunity to stand for what we be
lieve. If enough of us band together, we
can show the parents in attendance as well
as the news media that we do not support
the murder of innocent civilians or the de
struction of our civil liberties.

Junior responds to tuition increase .
I am writing in response to Wendelin
Wright's critique of Meghana Reddy's
letter to the editor, Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 re
spectively. Before Wright makes state
ments like "Reddy should be ashamed of
her baseless attack," I'd urge her to ana
lyze Reddy's letter more carefully, for
Wright's letter suffers from several logi
cal fallacies.
First, Wright falls for the 'straw man'
fallacy part of the 'missing the point' cat
egory of logical fallacies. Her letter pur
ports to refute Reddy's points, but in fact
does not do so. Fit her she did not com
prehend Reddy's subtleties or was inten
tionally misleading.
On Feb. 6, The Daily wrote, "Accord
ing to the Trustees, the hike reflects
Stanford's commitment to admitting stu
dents regardless of their ability to pay."
Reddy then refutes this point, essen
tially saying that this gives a 'false dilem
ma.' A false dilemma is when two options
are given, but in reality there are a lot
more. The Trustees are implying (at
least the way it was reported in The
Daily) the choice was between raising tu
ition and keeping the commitment to
need-blind admissions or maintaining
the current tuition but reducing the
commitment to need-blind admissions.
Reddy argues that this was a false
dilemma, saying that there were not two
options but several more. She introduces
her new choice as extravagant spending.
She argues (or implies) that the uni
versity could do any of the following:
first, cut extravagant spending, keep
tuition the same, and make a commit
ment to need-blind admissions; sec
ond, keep extravagant spending, raise
tuition, and make commitment to
need-blind admissions; or third, keep
extravagant spending, raise tuition, re
duce commitment to need-blind policy.
There are, of c ourse, more options but

for simplicity's sake, I'll stop here.
Her attack on the University is for pre
senting a false dilemma, where the Uni
versity presents the choice between need
blind admissions or tuition hikes but in
reality there are more variables, includ
ing Reddy's variable of opulent spending
(palm trees, extravagant buildings, etc).
She then criticizes the use of this false
dilemma, as it divides the student body.
Thus Reddy's "attack" on the Board
was for presenting a false dilemma, not
for raising tuition. Wright, however, ar
gues about the necessity of a tuition hike
and does not even address Reddy's point.
