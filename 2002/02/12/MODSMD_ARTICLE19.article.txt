I'lie top-ranked Stanford women's tennis

Madison, Wis., as it it'll to No. 5 Georgia, 4-3, in
the semifinal round.
The Cardinal's last loss had been in the 2000
N( LV\ Championships to none other than the
(ieorgia Bulldogs (6-0).

Saturday: No. 5 Georgia 4, No. 1

doubles matches. No. 20 Agatha Cioroch and
Lori Grey put away Stanford's No. 6 tandem of
sophomore Lauren Barnikow and freshman
Erin Burdette, 8-3. Tina Hojnik and Mariel
Verban barely edged (Cardinal seniors Gabriela
I .astra and Keiko Tokuda, 9-8 (4) to secure the
doubles point.
Kalvaria and sophomore Emilia Anderson
accounted for the Cardinal's only doubles victo
ry, dispatching Anne Nguyen and Jeannette
Mattsson, 8-3.

"The doubles point is crucial," Kalvaria said.
"It gives the other team confidence to know that
they only have to win three out of six in singles."
Kalvaria, Stanford's top player, was unable
to compete in singles and moved down to third
flight doubles because of an injury. She hopes to
return to singles play soon, though.
"The injury's definitely improving, and I
feel like it should only be a few more days,"
Kalvaria said.
Kalvaria's absence made the tournament
much tougher for the Cardinal, as it forced
everyone up a flight in singles to make up for
the loss of the nation's No. 4 singles player, and
left the team with two unusual doubles
tandems and without the top-ranked tandem
of Kalvaria and Lastra.
The Bulldogs won at the 1, 3, and 5 singles
slots to secure the victory. No. IS Cioroch
downed No. 11 Lastra, 6-2,6-0, No. 36 Nguyen

Assured of a victory, Georgia head coach
chose to concede all three remaining singles
matches to Stanford.
Stanford made it to the semifinals of the In
doors by blanking host Wisconsin, 7-0, and dis
patching No. 15 Wake Forest, 5-2.
"Everyone stepped up really well in adverse
conditions," Kalvaria said.
Against Wisconsin, all six Cardinal singles
players won their matches.
in doubles, Barnikow and Burdette won, as
did Lastra and Tokuda. Anderson and Kalvaria
lost, 8-6, for the Badgers' only match victory.
Stanford beat Wake Forest on the strength
of four singles victories and two of three dou
bles matches.
After Barnikow and Burdette fell 8-5 to
Wake Forest's No. 3 tandem of Bea Bielik and
Janet Bergman, Lastra and Tokuda handled
