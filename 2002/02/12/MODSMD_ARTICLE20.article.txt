# 2002 Olympics... worth it to watch or not?

### RYAN STEWART STAFF COLUMNIST 
As the international assembly of nations gets
underway in Salt Lake City, Utah, I would like to
take a moment to step back and really try to get
into t he true spirit of the 2002 Olympic Games.
Amidst the fanfare, spectacle and scandal
that have come to symbolize the games in re
cent years, searching lor meaning and idealism
in t he Games has become a daunting, arduous
and nearly impossible task. So, after 10 minutes
of good, hard soul-searching, here is what I
came up with.
Given the venue, 1 think the main idea the
2002 Games will portray is that Mormons sure
know how to throw a party, albeit a party with
out alcohol or coed rooms. They certainly have
shown that they belong in the elite class in
terms of putting on a spectacular opening cer
emony celebration.
Turning the attention to the Games' govern
ing body, the 2002 (Mympics should also prove
that crime really does pay and it pays well. While
the rancor over the bribery charges leveled at
the Salt Lake City organizing committee and

former lOC chair Juan Anto
nio Samaranch have died
down to a whisper, these
Olympics will always be tainted
by the public discovery of the
millions of dollars Mowing
through illegal channels in
order to secure a bid for the
host city. Jeff Gilooly and
Tonya Harding should take

notes on how to temper a past scandal when the
Games get underway.
After viewing Sunday's coverage of the Games
on NBC, one thing remains crystal-clear about
the Winter Olympics: They're not popular
enough to pre-empt Michael Jordan's return to
the N HA All-Star Game.
Even though we, as a country, may temporar
ily relax our disposition to scorn televised figure
skating exhibitions, we're not about to flat out lie
to ourselves. We'd rather watch Tracy McGrady
throw alley-oops to himself in a lopsided all-star
game than watch some kid from Helsinki live out
his life's dream in cross-country skiing.
Now, if there were televised episodes of
Olympic athletes, tempted by 16 sexy singles,

cheating on their long-time girlfriends and / or
people being strategically voted off the
Olympic team in a series of backstabbing
rounds, things could change. Let's hope Fox
never gets the Olympics.
And as the world unites for the first major in
ternational sporting event since Sept. 11, sever
al things become clear. Right now, it's cool to be
proud of your homeland, even if you're not
from Texas. Soon enough we'll be able to go
back and proudly denounce our country as
being too materialistic, not car ing about its poor
and impoverished and not taking a strong
enough stand to rid the world of injustices. Rut
for 16 shining days in February, we can stand up
with the Miracle on Ice team of 1980 as they
rekindle our proudest Winter Olympic mo
ment by lighting the torch and proudly chant,
"USA, USA, USA."
And as our cheers echo high into the Utah
skies, our mighty corporations can prove once
again that even in these troubled times of reces
sion and Enron, we can st ill capitalize on t he pain
and suffering of a nation by putting the American
