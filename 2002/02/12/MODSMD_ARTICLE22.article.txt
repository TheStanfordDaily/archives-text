I he doubleheader featured an
extra-inning gut-check followed by
an explosion of Cardinal offense.
Junior fori Nyberg started the
first contest of the twin-bill in the cir
cle and pitched thte entire nine-in
ning game.
Nyberg carried the Cardinal in a
scoreless game until the top of the
fourth inning when sophomore
catcher Jessica Allister knocked in
senior centerfielder Jessica Men
doza on a fielder's choice to post the
game's first run.
The pitchers' duel was on once
again, as both the Cardinal and
Tiger bats would remain silent until
the bottom of the seventh inning.
Pacific came back in its last at bat
to load the bases with no outs, only
to find itself two batters later with
two outs.
But the relentless Tigers man
aged to push a run across the plate
when third baseman Krista Allen
knocked an RBI base hit to left field
to force the game into extra innings.
Two innings later, in the top of
the ninth, junior Cassi Brangham
came up with a clutch RBI double to
left field, storing junior kira Ching,

who reached base on a walk.
Nyberg sealed the victoiy in the
bottom of the ninth by shutting

All-American pitcher Cindy Ball.
file Cardinal recognized what it
meant to pull out such a tough vic
toiy early in the season.
" 1 laving to hang onto a lead and
really battle was a test for us,"
Brangham said. "I think it was a re
ally good confidence-booster be
cause it was the first time we have
been truly challenged this year."
In the second contest of the
day, Stanford wasted little time, as
Ching kicked oil the first inning
by sending a shot to right field,
scoring senior shortstop Robin
Walker and senior first baseman
Sarah Beeson.
The Cardinal defense made a
short appearance in the field before
returning to the dugout in the sec
ond inning when junior pitcher
Maureen LeCocq helped her own
cause by knocking a lead oil home
run over the fence.
And it didn't stop there.
In the third, the Cardinal tacked
on three more runs when LeCocq
and Brangham both roped RBI sin
gles and Allister scored on an error
by the third baseman.
Yet, this time, the Tigers
would answer.
In the bottom of the third, Pacif
ic managed to chalk up two runs on
a combination of an RBI single and
a walk with the bases loaded, but
LeGxq stopped the Tigers and
held the score at 6-2.
Stanford's bats returned again in
the fifth when freshman Elizabeth
Bendig roped a single to score
Ching. Walker sealed the deal in the

out of the park and scored the last
run of the day, capping the Stan
ford victory at 8-2.
LeCocq continued to silence the
Pacific offense while leading the
Cardinal bats in the second game,
going 3 for 4 at the plate.
Head coach John Rittman was
pleased with the break-out offensive
performance in the second game

and the clutch hits produced in the
first battle.
"We did an excellent job," Rittman
said. "Maureen obviously, and then
Cassi and kira had some dutch hits.
Also, Jessica Allister drove in a really
big run for us in die first game."
"1 laving to use everyone for both
games was g<x xl experience," Brang
ham said. "We are going to need
everyone when we are on the road."
And that is where the team is
headed. The Cardinal will travel to
four tournaments across the coun
try before returning to the Farm on
March 5.
