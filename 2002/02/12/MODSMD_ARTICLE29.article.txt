# Volleyball breaks five-game losing streak

### KATRINA LAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One quote from men's volleyball coach
Don Shaw summed up the entire weekend
in Southern California:
"Sometimes you're the windshield
and sometimes you're the bug. One
night we were the bug, and the next
night we were the windshield."

MEN / S VOLLEYBALL
Friday: UC-Santa Barbara 3, No. 6
Stanford 0 '
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 3, No. 13
Cal State-Northridge 0

No. 0 Stanford (6-6, 5-4 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) dropped the ball
against No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara (7-3, 4-3)
on Friday, but then finally overcame a five
game losing streak by beating No. 13 Cal-
State Northridge (6-5, 3-4) on Saturday.
On Friday, Stanford found itself out
blocked, out-killed, and out-hit (30-24,
30-22, 30-15) by the same Gauchos that
succumbed to the Cardinal, 3-1, earlier in
the season.
"We were not there mentally or physical
ly. It was ugly," Shaw said.
Though the two teams seemed equally
matched at the beginning of the night,
Stanford slipped farther and farther into
mediocre play.
Stanford went from losing by six points in
the first game, to losing by eight points in the
second, and finally, to losing by a miserable
15-point margin in the third game.
This trend was even more evident in hit
ting percentages, as Stanford's .354 in the
first game plunged to .233 in the second and

to a sparse .071 in the third game.
"We came out Hat and ended flat. They
tame out to beat us and they wanted it
more than we did," said junior opposite
Curt Toppel.
The tired Stanford squad's .231 clip and
two blocks was no match tor the Gauchos'
.489 clip and eight blocks.
"It was one of those nights when you get
your butt kicked and you just want to get out
of the gym as fast as you can," Shaw said.
Friday's loss rounded up a five-game
losing streak that dropped Stanford in the
MPSF conference standings and docked
the morale of a team that had been ranked
second in the country just last week.
Searching for redemption, the Cardinal
discovered long-lost grace and confidence
on Saturday when it celebrated a 30-28, 30-
22,30-24 vic tory over Cal State-Northridge.
Though the scores indicate a solid
Stanford dominance throughout the
match, it was not always the case. In the
first game, the Cardinal found itself at a
seemingly insuperable 27-23 deficit.
However, Stanford rebounded and
showed potential to transform from bug to
windshield. In what may turn out to be the
turning point oft he season, the Cardinal won
the first game, 30-28, and never* looked back.
"We definitely had a hump to get
over. Our win against Northridge
helped us overcome some of our prob
lems. We can start a new season now,"
Toppel said.
The same Stanford offense that posted a
season-low .071 clip in the third game
against UC-Santa Barbara maintained a
.544 clip for the match and a .609 clip in the
third game against the Matadors. The
squad improved to nine blocks from the
meager two it posted the night before.
