## Speakers discuss getting a job with a liberal arts degree 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Responding to concerns
from liberal arts majors that em
ployment and internship op
portunities seem few and far be
tween, the Career Development
Center kicked off its third annu
al Liberal Arts Career Week yes
terday afternoon.
The CDC is sponsoring re
ceptions, panels and career fairs
through Friday aimed at expos
ing liberal arts students, often
unaware of their options after
graduation, to the variety of op
portunities available to them.
"There's this image that lib
eral arts majors are not em
ployable," said Lance Choy, di
rector of the CDC. "We need
to help liberal arts majors
learn of the opportunities that
are out there."
According to Veda Jeffries,
assistant director of the ClXthe
week is intended to connect stu
dents with companies.
"The overall goal is to get lib
eral arts students to know busi
nesses that hire," she said.
Jeffries and other employ
ees from the CDC said students
in science or engineering often
have an easier time finding job
opportunities, as employers in
these fields recruit vigorously.
At other career fairs, such as
the one held each October,
technology and engineering
companies are the most preve
lant, according Jeffries. This
increases the need for the CDC
to focus its efforts on behalf of
liberal arts students.
"The goal of this week is so
students can look at all different
careers in liberal arts fields," said
Kristin Conner, a career coun
selor at the CDC.
The week's keynote speaker,
Mark Oldman, a founding part

ner ofVault.com, a Web site de
voted to finding internships and
employment, pointed out the
extra steps liberal arts students
must take in seeking jobs.
"What liberal arts students
don't realize is that the onus is
on them," Oldman said. "For
pre-meds there is a pre-estab
lished bridge; the path is there,
they just need to step on it. The
biggest danger is that [liberal
arts] students think that the
bridge is built for them already."
The week began yesterday
with Oldman's speech, followed
by a reception for students and
various alumni, repesenting the
fields of education, communica
tions, public service, marketing,
government, and arts and enter
tainment. At the end of the day,
there was a reception for stu
dents interested in public service.
The remainder of the week
will feature two internship
fairs, as well as panels on dif
ferent career fields and inter
viewing stategies.
The first internship fair will
be held today and will focus on
public service opportunities,
while Thursday's fair is geared
toward business employment.
In deciding what compa
nies and organizations to fea
ture at career week, CDC
workers said they were most
concerned with diversity.
"We try to vary it from year to
year so students in liberal arts
can get a variety," Conner said.
Jeffries said that the CDC tries
to get companies representing
fields beyond investment bank
ing and consulting, occupations
with which Stanford students are
more familiar.
Conner also emphasized that
the career fair is not exclusively
for liberal arts students interest
ed in liberal arts companies.
"We'll definitely have tech
companies, but [they're here to
discuss] using a liberal arts de
gree at a tech company," she
said. "Also, students with tech
