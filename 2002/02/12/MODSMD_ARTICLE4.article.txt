# Committee addresses transportation
## ASSU tries to make public transportation accessible for carless 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an effort to better meet the
needs of students, the ASSU
formed a task force last quarter to
address the issues of transporta
tion, diversity and the arts.
Called the ASSU Community
Team, the task force has two
subcommittees, with one desig
nated specifically to off-campus
transportation.
"When the committee first
formed, we brainstormed issues
we felt were most pertinent to the
student body," said sophomore
Sima Gandhi, ASSU communica
tions co-director and the head of
the transportation committee. "Bi
cycle safety, inconvenient public
transportation and (the) unreli
able Marguerites were just a few of
the items discussed."
Some of the initiatives aim to
educate students about available

transportation, while others are
designed to provide improved ser
vices to students.
"We are working on a Web site
designed to help students without
cars find public transportation
routes to get around the Bay
Area," said junior Raqiyyah Pip
pins, a member of the team.
Gandhi said the Web site will
give students the most efficient
public transportation route fora
particular destination.
"It will serve as a middleman
between students and the vast
array of public transportation
routes," she said.
Another initiative is to provide
students with maps and trans
portation schedules.
"We are working on getting a
rack in the Tresidder area that will
be stocked with maps and other in
formation about public trans
portation," Gandhi said.
I'he committee is also meeting
with Parking and Transporta
tion Services.
"With the University planning
some major overhauls in the trans
portation system, it is important to
represent student interests,"

Gandhi said. "We plan to set up
workshops and presentations to
educate students about trans
portation issues and information."
Gandhi said these sessions will
be helpful in making new students
aware of the different alternatives.
"We are hoping to start training
'transportation reps' for at least
each freshman dorm so that there
is always someone available that is
knowledgeable of public trans
portation in the area," Pippins said.
But the transportation commit
tee doesn't deal only with trans
portation issues. The committee
also is trying to give students a
chance to get discounts at restuar
ants and stores.
"Fora minimal fee, Student
Advantage [a national company]
offers a card that provides stu
dents with discounts on a nation
wide scale at chain stores, airlines
and other large retail stores,"
Gandhi said.
Participating stores include
Foot Locker, Greyhound, Ainttak
and US Airways.
"We hope that the Stanford com
munity will take advantage of this
opportunity next fall," Pippins said.
