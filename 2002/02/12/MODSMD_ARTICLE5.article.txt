### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Moore, 51, died Sunday in his
home town of Fremont.
Moore collapsed after playing
basketball and was taken to Wash
ington Hospital in Fremont. The
cause of death is still being inves
tigated by the Alameda County
coroner's office, according to
Lieut. Del Bandy, information of
ficer for the Stanford Department
of Public Safety.
Moore, a 28-year veteran of
the department, was named the
University's fifth police chief last
year. He joined the department
in 1973 and was promoted to
sergeant three years later and
lieutenant two years after. He
was promoted to captain in 1981.
In May 2001, Moore replaced
retiring long-time chief Marvin
Herrington. He was nominated
for the position by a panel cho
sen by University President John
Hennessy and headed by Jeffrey
Seilback, the University's risk
management director.
"1 believe my strongest charac

teristic: is equanimity," Moore told
The Daily last May after lie was
named police chief. "I maintain
an objective view of a situation,
even under adverse circum
stances. 1 am committed to the no
tion that high values as a depart
ment will produce high service."
Moore often praised the de
partment and said how much it
had grown since he first arrived.
"In the time I have been here,
we have grown professionally,
and we insist on quality in the ser
vice we provide," Moore said last
year. "This is the best enforce
ment job in the entire world."
He also said that he knew
Stanford was "an educational
institution" and kept that in
mind when it came to enforcing
the law.
"Students are still learning
how to make decisions, and we
think bad decisions should not be
terminal," Moore said. "We real
ize that enforcement may not al
ways be the best option, and we
will come back to enforcement
when it is the only viable option."
Two weeks ago, Moore spoke
to The Daily about bike safety
around campus. "Do we expect
all bicyclists to come to a com
plete stop at a stop sign? No," he
said. "We just want them to use
