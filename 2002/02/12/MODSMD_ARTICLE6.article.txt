# KZSU radio broadcasts news program
## Student radio show tackles tough topics every Monday night 
### ELLIE RITCH STAFF WRITER 
Have you ever tried to find a radio station
with a news show unlike Howard Stern or
National Public Radio? KZSU may have just
what you are looking for.
The show, called "Things We Want to
fell You," premiered on Jan. 21 and has to
date addressed a variety of issues, including
global warming and the sexuality of Bono
bos monkeys.
"Things" airs Monday from 6 p.m. to 7
p.m. on KZSU, and is a discussion-oriented
program.
The format fluctuates but focuses on
bringing out different opinions and angles

on the latest news stories.
The staff of Stan ford students includes two
law students, a biology graduate student and
two undergraduates.
Junior Frank Yeh, news director of KZSU
and the technical director of the show, de
scribed the content of "Things" as an inte
gration of world, national, local, campus and
personal news.
"[Topics are] fictional, but not improb
able," Yeh said. "Discussion topics [have
been] 'College Tuition and Other Forms
of Legalized Extortion' or 'Making out
After Sept. 11: Why Escondido Village
Rocks the Casbah. "
He stressed that the show's staff is devot
ed to balancing the serious and the nutty.
Stories covered so far have included the kid
napping of alumnus Daniel Pearl, the Cali
fornia inmate in need of a multi-million dol
lar heart transplant, and the 24-hour bus
that runs from East Palo Alto to downtown
Palo Alto, which has some Palo Alto residents

up in arms.
Yeh said that stories are not presented in
an academic manner.
"Debate is the wrong word," he said.
"We discuss, and to keep things intelligent
we avoid sounding like an I HUM section at
all costs."
Each week one staff member is chosen
to organize the content of the show and
act as the host. Adam Kolber, a third-year
law student, served as the host of last
night's broadcast.
"We call the host the news czar," Kolber
said. "It's [his or her] job to put the lineup to
gether and get a sense of what people want
to talk about."
Kolber had ultimate discretion on topics
last night and acted as moderator.
"We have a component of our show that is
debate-like, but if you want NPR, listen to
Nl'R â€” we're going to give you tlie Stanford
voice," Kolber said.
Freshman Sophie Alcorn
joined the staff of the news
broadcast during lall quarter.
She said she believes radio dis
cussion is far more interesting
and pertinent to the Stanford
community than a simple re
hashing of the day's news.

"We want to give people dif
ferent perspectives on issues
and make them think about
things they haven't considered
before," Alcorn said.
The staff of "Things We
Want to Tell You" stressed that
they love to have their listeners
caJl in.
"We don't know what our au
dience is like, and it's hard to
guess unless they call in," said
1 lelen Fields, a biology graduate
student and staff member.
