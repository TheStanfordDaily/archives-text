Golden Gate Bridge
considers raising toll
SAN FRANCISC X) (AP) — The thought of paying
$5 to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge is causing a
lot of concern. Imagine how charging for walking
across will be greeted.
I lie bridge district has been talking about raising the
current $3 toll to $4 and even $5 to help offset a cut in
revenue. But another discussion has focused on charg
ing people walking or riding their bikes over the span.
Ihe walking toll is just one of a number of ideas tfie
Bridge District board of directors is looking at to help
fund a $388 million project to strengthen the bridge
against earthquakes. The money would also go to han
dle the increased cost of security since the Sept. 11 ter
ror attacks.

Five charged with neglect
SAN RAFAEL (AP) — A man and four women who
shared a home with their 13 children were charged with
murder and child neglect yesterday in the death of one
toddler and the malnourishment of the other youngsters.
I he 19-month-old toddler — whose bones were ex
tremely brittle — was pronounced dead of severe mal
nutrition and neglect at a hospital in November after
the women brought, him in. The other children, rang
ing in age from 8 months to If) years, were quickly put
into emergency foster care.
All were severely malnourished and most suffered
from rickets, a bone-softening disease almost unheard
of in suburban America. It is caused by a lack ofvitamin
D or calcium.
None of the children were enrolled in public school.
Neighbors rarely saw them emerge from the upscale
rental home, where heavy white drapes prevent any
view of the inside.
Because the adults refused to cooperate, it took three
months for police to unravel what went on inside the
modest beige house.
Winnfred Wright, 45, and - he women, Carol Brem
ner, 44, Mary Campbell, 37, Deirdre Wilson, 37, and
Kali Polk-Matthews, 20, were arrested Friday and held
without bail for an arraignment yesterday.
Because none of the defendants cooperated with po
lice, it took DNA tests to determine that Wright fa
thered all the children. It was not clear who gave birth
to the child who died.
Wright, Bremner, Campbell and Wilson each face
charges of second-degree murder and involuntary
manslaughter. Polk-Matthews laces one count of invol
untary manslaughter. All face child endangerment
charges.
ACADEMIA
Privacy? Priceless.
The American Civil Liberties Union demanded last
month that the University and Community College Sys
tem of Nevada stop selling the names and addresses of
current and former students to credit-card companies.
In a letter to Jane Nichols, chancellor of the Nevada
system, the ACLU of Nevada and the nat ional ACLU
argued that the sale of information about students to
credit-card companies violated the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA.
The law, commonly known as the Buckley Amend
ment, allows colleges to make public "directory infor
mation," but only if they notify students of the policy
and allow them to opt out.
ACLU officials say that some institutions are not
doing enough to alert students of that option.
"Putting information about FERPA in the back of a
course catalog isn't enough," said Gary Peck, executive
director ol the Nevada ACLU. "Most students don't
know this is happening."
