Surfer rescued at Lighthouse
Point
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) — Passers-by rescued a surfer
being smashed against rocks at Lighthouse Point.
Mike Aalgaard, 33, suffered a dislocated left shoulder
and ring finger and head injuries Monday when his surf
board leash became tangled on rocks and the remnants of
a rusted metal pole.
The imperiled surfer's screams got the attention of Mike
DeWitt, Jim Moyles and Pat Simms. The trio ran down to
the cliff and found Aalgaard dangling upside down by his
leash, getting smashed against the jagged rocks by waves.
Then, the leash broke and Aalgaard was washed into a
cave beneath the cliff.
"His head was going to get smashed like a grapefruit
against those rocks," DeWitt said. "You could tell if we
didn't do something, it was going to get worse."
DeWitt snatched Aalgaard by the back of his wetsuit and
the trio pulled him to safety.
