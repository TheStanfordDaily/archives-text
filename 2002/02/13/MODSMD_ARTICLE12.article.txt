1990
On Feb. 13, 1990, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about cuts in federal financial aid.
"In the college world, wars are fought not
with bullets but with dollars. And with dwin
dling governmental support, Stanford's Fi
nancial Aids Office appears to be losing.
"During President Reagan's eight years in
office, the number of grant awards decreased
and the total dollar amount of student loans
increased. At the same time, the focus of the
U.S. government switched from giving mid
dle-income students a choice among institu
tions to providing the minimum amount of
funding to assure access to higher education.
"'Financial aid programs are casualties of
the efforts, to deal with the [federal] budget
deficit,' according to Financial Aids Director
Robert HuIT.
"Ironically, federal student aid began in the
midst of other wars.
"During the Cold War, the distant calls of
Sputnik prompted the United States to pour
more money into education. In 1958, the
government began the National Defense Ed
ucation Act, predecessor of today's Perkins
loan program.
"That same year, Stanford created the Fi
nancial Aids Office, merging aid programs
throughout the University into a single entity."
Bottom Line: We like need-blind admissions, even
though maintaining it is always difficult.
