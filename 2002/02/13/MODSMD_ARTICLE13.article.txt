BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
(AP) — "The Lord of the Rings:
I'he Fellowship of the Ring" may
have earned a leading 13 Acade
my Award nominations yester
day, but the fantasy epic faces a
hurdle in a best-picture race
against a more traditional
drama, "A Beautiful Mind."
"Lord of the Rings" is last
year's No. 2 box-office hit. But
fantasies have rarely been taken
seriously by Oscar voters, and an
otherworldly epic such as the first
film installment of J.R.R.
Tolkien's classic has never won
best picture.

"A Beautiful Mind" — tied
with "Moulin Rouge" for second
place with eight nominations —
is the sort of heavy drama mem

bers of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences often
favor. "A Beautiful Mind" beat
"Lord of the Rings" for top dra
matic honors at last month's
Golden Globes.
Among nominations for "Lord
of the Rings" were best picture,
best director and supporting
actor for lan McKellen, while "A
Beautiful Mind" — a dramatiza
tion of math genius John Nash's
battle with schizophrenia — re
ceived nominations for best pic
ture, director Ron Howard, actor
Russell Crowe and supporting ac
tress Jennifer Connelly.
