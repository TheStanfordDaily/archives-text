## The 						Stanford Daily Prevailing wage campaign takes issue too far 
### 
Published Since J891

We congratulate the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition and the
Coalition Against Subcontracting
for the work they have done to in
stitute a living wage for all directly and indi
rectly hired workers at Stanford. This action
will improve the quality of life for some of
Stanford's poorest-paid workers.
But we do not support the groups' recently
announced prevailing wage campaign. While
it is important to bring workers' wages up to
fair levels, we believe that the proposed pre
vailing wage model might actually hurt unions
and the workers in them.
A prevailing wage system is one in which all
workers who perform a certain job receive the
same pay, regardless of whether the worker is
in a union. A prevailing wage system does
allow for higher wages based on seniority.
According to SLAC, the problem with a living

wage policy at an institution like Stanford is that
some workers are unionized and others are not.
So workers who are unionized may have a high
er salary than their non-union counterparts.
While the living wage of $10.10 per hour
will bring up the salary of non-union workers
who make less than that, union workers mak
ing more than that amount would receive no
pay increase. SLAC argues that the Universi
ty would have little incentive to continue pay
ing union workers higher than the living
wage if it knows that it can obtain other work
ers for less money.
But the University has hired union workers
all along. If it wanted to replace these workers
with lower-paid ones, it probably would have
done so already. Now that the University pays
a higher minimum wage, it has even less in
centive to replace union workers with non
union workers.

It is highly unlikely that a union, during its
next contract negotiations, will accept a pay
cut because other workers are paid a lower
wage. Unions have just as much leverage
under the new system as they did under the
old, and they do not have to, and most likely
will not, accept an agreement that is not bene
ficial to their members.
There is a further adverse effect possible
from implementing a prevailing wage system.
If Stanford institutes such a wage in order to
strengthen collective bargaining and union
ization, it may in fact do just the opposite:
Workers will see little reason to remain in a
union if their non-union counterparts receive
the same salary as they do.
Union members pay dues to the union. As
a benefit, they get the power of collective bar
gaining and often a higher wage than non
union workers. If the benefits of unionization

dry up, workers will see little reason to contin
ue paying union dues.
The living wage of $ 10.1 Oper hour is a vast
improvement over what many workers used
to be paid at Stanford. While that is no excuse
for complacency when it comes to workers'
rights, the groups should see the implementa
tion of the living wage as the true victory it is
â€” achieved, in great part, because of their
hard work. There was a moral imperative to
implement the living wage as a baseline for
survival in this region. There is no moral im
perative to implement the prevailing wage.
Workers who want collective bargaining
should be allowed to join a union to achieve
such result, and there must be a tangible fi
nancial benefit to being a member of such
an organization. The living wage proposal
is a tremendous step, but the prevailing
wage is a step too far.
