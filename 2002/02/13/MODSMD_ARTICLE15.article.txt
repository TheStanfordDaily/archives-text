# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Nike defends practices 
### VADA MANAGER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Tuesday's opinion piece profiling
James Ready provided Stanford Daily
readers with rich imagery of the passion
ate activist and litigant Fighting for his
cause. The author, Rush Rehm, fails to
provide readers with much available
neutral evidence that provides a differ
ent picture from that which Ready paints
and promotes.
First and foremost, Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff should feel confi
dent knowing that products bearing the
institution's name, whether made in the
U.S. or abroad, were made under well
established standards and regularly
monitored working conditions. In addi
tion to external independent monitor
ing, Nike currently has more than 30
employees dedicated to ensuring that
the workers at more than 850 contract
factory sites throughout the world have
good wages and a safe, fair and healthy
work environment.
In Indonesia, as early as 1996, a team
of Washington Post foreign service corre
spondents chronicled the lives of several
factory workers, comfortably concluding
in the article's sub-headline, "Indone
sians praise work at Nike factory."
Three years later, a distinguished
group of senior journalists on fellowships
visited the country and a fabled Nike fac
tory. One of the journalists on the trip
from the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel
profiled two average workers who ex
pressed similar satisfaction with their
work and conditions.
In a quest for still greater informa
tion than Nike's own internal monitor
ing or external journalistic accounts
could provide, we engaged in a trans
parent assessment of our Indonesia op
erations with an independent entity,
the Global Alliance for Workers and
Communities. Although some disturb
ing issues were identified in over 4,000
interviews with workers at nine facto
ries, a couple of irrefutable facts
emerged from the academic-based re
search. An overwhelming majority of
the workers expressed satisfaction with
job skills training and recreation ser
vices at the factory. A majority of work
ers also reported satisfaction with their
relationship with supervisors and man
agers. As anyone who works knows,
there is no workplace in the world that
is 100 percent compliant and perfect by
every measure.
A Wisconsin State Journal reporter in
July 2000 provided this view of a Nike
contract factory in Indonesia:
"The factory in Tangerang, Indone
sia with 5,355 workers, is modern and
clean, better than some I have seen in
the United States. In a country with an
economic crisis, 30 percent unemploy
ment and 60 percent of the people liv

ing below the poverty line, jobs here are
very desirable."
In addition, an editorial by the Asian
Wall Street journal in March 2001 re
garding the Global Alliance study pro
vides further insight into Nike's efforts
in Indonesia. "The truth of the matter
is that many corporations are responsi
ble employers that now demonstrate
proactive concern for workers making
their products. Nike deserves applause
for being a leader in standards for oth
ers to follow."
As the economy struggled in Indone
sia, Nike also increased wages over 40
percent for entry-level Indonesian facto
ry workers. Periodic independent uni
versity studies have shown many workers
earn enough to send funds home to rela
tives and dependents. Most workers also
receive benefits such as access to free
medical care in footwear factories, hous
ing, transportation and meals.
Keadv and his partner, Kretzu, are
simply wrong in their generalization of
Nike's contract factory employees. On
any given day at some Nike contract fac
tories, one can witness more than a hun
dred people in line to apply fora single
opening. During the Muslim holidays
when factories are closed for ten days and
workers return home or to villages, the
return rates to the factory are at approx
imately 94 percent (taking into account
women who have earned enough money
at the factory or choose to remain to
begin families). Employers who mistreat
workers (whether in Indonesia or Indi
ana) do not usually command such re
spect or worker return rates.
Furthermore, some Indonesians
find Ready's adventures (alleged losing
weight living on a local diet of vegeta
bles, rice, etc.) comical or even insult
ing, considering Western diets are rich
with pizza, burgers and other non-
Asian staples. Give the workers and
other local Indonesians credit. They
have figured out long ago that Nike —
not the well-meaning but misinformed
Ready — provides the best opportunity
to achieve a better standard of living for
their families.
We encourage readers to visit our
Web Site at www.nikebiz.com for an
online factory tour, so they can judge
fot themselves what conditions are re
ally like where Nike products are
manufactured.
The tour, along with Nike's recently
released Corporate Responsibility Re
port, will give visitors an insider's
glimpse into a segment of the increas
ingly complex global supply chain and
insight into other Nike corporate re
sponsibility programs, including initia
tives in environmental sustainability and
community involvement.
