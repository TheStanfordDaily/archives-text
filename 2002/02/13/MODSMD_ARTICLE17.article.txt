Seniors disappointed with selection of Rice
We are writing to express our disap
pointment at the choice of Condoleezza
Rice as commencement speaker for the
Class of 2002. The choice reveals a lack of
consideration of what Rice represents to
several segments of the ("lass of 2002 and
how her presence will affect the gradua
tion experience of these students.
As graduating seniors, we have worked
incredibly hard and sacrificed many
nights of sleep on the path to June 10,
2002, when we are to receive our degrees.
Our commencement is the reason for all
this hard work, the highest of our achieve
ments, and is supposed to be one of the
happiest and most fulfilling days of our
lives. However, with the choice of Con
doleezza Rice as speaker, these feelings of
hope and happiness quickly turned to sad
ness, anger, or betrayal for many diverse
members of this year's graduating class.
Despite what media may say, there are
students here at Stanford who see the
U.S.'s current military campaign not as an
effective war on terrorism, but an assault
on the civilians of Afghanistan that violates
numerous international laws, perpetuates
racism both at home and abroad and ulti
mately avoids the real issues behind ter
rorism. For these students, Rice's pres
ence is extremely offensive. ()n the day we
are to set off into the "real world," we will
be face to face with one of the orchestra
tors of one of the very things we find most
abhorrent in it.
Aside from these concerns, consider
the graduation experiences of many of
our valued international students. How
are our Iranian students, Korean stu
dents, Filipino students, or students from
any of the other countries targeted by the
administration, to feel when the person
who is supposed to inspire and encourage
them at their commencement is also the
person who plans attacks on their home
land? What are they to think, considering

the civilian casualties in the Afghan cam
paign, when the actions of their com
mencement speaker may lead to the
deaths of their countrymen, their families,
their friends, or perhaps even themselves?
The bottom line is that we question the
appropriateness of selecting a highly politi
cal figure, whose agenda many could find
objectionable, as the speaker at our Com
mencement. It is not as if this is an event stu
dents could simply choose to attend or
avoid; boycotting their own graduation is
hardly an easy choice for graduating se
niors. As members of the Class 0f2002 who,
for one reason or another, deeply oppose
the selection of Condoleezza Rice as com
mencement speaker, we are faced with two
unpleasant alternatives: being hurt and of
fended at our own commencement, or miss
ing one of the biggest milestones in our lives.
We should not be faced with such a choice.

Zide wrongfully attacked Rice's character
and democratic process
Josh Zide's manuscript is not, as he al
leges, about disapproval of the military ac
tions in Afghanistan, but is a cloaked at
tempt to undermine the democratic free
doms he stands to defend. The elected se
nior class representatives provided a list of
25 favorable speakers, a mechanism
through which the University administra
tion is empowered, by the students them
selves, to select a final candidate.
From this process, we have the honor
of hearing National Security Adviser Con
doleezza Rite speak. It is clear that Zide
disagrees with Rice's political views, and

more likely her administration's less
than-submissive nature. A difference in
political views is inevitable, but to tread
farther and impugn Rice's character for
"killing Afghani civilians," is intolerable,
especially when alternative measures
were not proffered.
Universities are centers of free thought
in the pursuit of excellence; they are not,
neither in time of peace nor the insidious
ness of war, a conscience for the govern
ment. The entire people of this nation are
the latter. To cleave and foment a single
isolated portion of the larger society for
"non-disruptive protest," segregates. That
a substantial majority of the citizenry of this
country support their president belies the
fragility of Zide's contentions and schemes.

Wais 'kept fraternity's best interests
in mind'
I am writing in response to yesterday's
editorial about my decision regarding the
Kappa Sigma fraternity. I sincerely wish
The Daily would have taken the time to
contact me to get my side of the story be
fore il printed an editorial that is factually
flawed and distorted. The fact is I accepted
and endorsed all six recommendations
provided by the Greek Judicial Board after
extensive consultation with the Board.
On rare occasions, 1 have modified the
Board's recommended sanctions. (The
last time I took such action was about four
years ago.) In this case, there were com
pelling health and safety issues identified
by the Board which placed individuals at
personal risk and led me to extend the fra
ternity's alcohol probation period. 1 took
this action only after much consultation
and reflection and with the fraternity's
best interests in mind.
