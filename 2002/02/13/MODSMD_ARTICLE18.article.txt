# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## The 						State of the ASSU: Brewer speaks on main issues, goals 
### MATT BREWER ASSU PRESIDENT 
Editor's Note: The following is an edited tran
script oj brewer's State of the Association speech
last week.

If at the beginning of the school year,
we were to ask everyone in this room to
describe the dominant forces affecting
students on and off campus, the answers
would be as diverse as the range of inter
ests of every student.
If you are the average Stanford stu
dent, Joe Random, then you might say
that the most dominant issues affecting
students revolve around issues of quality
of life. The campus, "commonly referred
to as the bubble," longs creative trans
portation alternatives to connect Stan
ford with the broader community. While
talks of a new student union float
throughout the air from year to year, the
General Use Permit prohibits any new
building for the next ten years. In addi
tion, housing trends suggest that more
and more students will live off-campus.
This resonates particularly with graduate
students, where beds cannot be built
quick enough to fully accommodate
housing demand. Furthermore, many
graduate students leave Stanford with
thousands of dollars in debt due to low
stipends that do not alleviate their finan
cial burden.
If you are a champion of diversity, you
might say that the dominant force affect
ing campus life is more a function of who
is here rather than what is here. The in
secure fate of community centers, the
all-of-a-sudden cancellation of the Latin
American Studies program, random
hate crimes that plague campus and
embody ignorance and insensitivity all
speak to a larger need to allocate re
sources towards initiatives that foster
cultural support and awareness. Events
such as Sept. 11 demonstrate how unan
ticipated stimuli can trigger negative re
sponses towards certain groups. As the
university wages 5 percent budget cuts
across the board, we must hold it ac
countable to its commitment to diversi

ty so that 5 percent is not taken away
from generators of diversity that em
power the entire Stanford community.
Or, if you are concerned with social
responsibility, then you might say that
the most dominant issues affecting stu
dents stem from attempted preserva
tions of environmental and social stan
dards. Some students are most con
cerned with the drive for green build
ings or land preservation, especially in
light of recent debates regarding the fate
of the Foothill trails. Others contend
that the most pressing issues concern so
cial responsibility that Stanford takes
while investing its endowment or the
wages it pays subcontracted workers.
All of these areas have resonance and
reality with each of us. We've listed
three things, the student life/student
services, diversity, and social / environ
mental responsibility. The question we
pose to you is this: What do these three
things have in common? They all repre
sent the manifestation of student voice
in t he decision-making processes that af
fect the Stanford experience. During
any given year, the role of the ASSU is to
amplify student voice into priority so
that it is properly heard when resources
are allocated.
In 1997, ASSU Vice President Ben
Der did his senior thesis on the power
structure of the ASSU. Backed by statis
tical evidence compiled over a two-year
period, Decker concluded that a "core"
of approximately five to seven students
was responsible for almost everything
the ASSU accomplished in any given
year. Decker would be pleased to know
that during this school year alone, over
100 non-elected officials have regularly
contributed to the overall success of the
association in a direct and meaningful
way. Accessibility has been a hallmark of
our administration to the extent that any
Stanford student has been provided with
a forum by which to work on issues that
affect the entire Stanford community.
We decided to form ACT, a fancy
acronym for the ASSU Community
Team, to make this accessibility a con
crete part of the ASSU structure. Some

will say that such a collaborative struc
ture can be perceived as counterproduc
tive to progress and compromising of
quality. However, on balance, we have
struck a sweet balance that has allowed us
to benefit from the creativity and energy
of a large diverse group without heavily
suffering from its potential inefficiencies.
Based on our past familiarity with the
ASSU, we both knew that traditionally
one of the biggest challenges of the ASSU
has been its communication with the stu
dents it represents. Oftentimes, this fail
ure to communicate materializes in the
mouths of students who ask, "What does
the ASSU do?" As an association we have
embraced many strategies to communi
cate with the student body. We have dis
tributed thousands of ASSU Newsletters
to the student body. During fall quarter,
Stanford students could tune into KZSU
to hear Farm Side chats featuring infor
mation from the ASSU. In addition to
radio shows and newsletters, we have
eaten with many dorms, undergraduate
and graduate students to answer ques
tions and inform about projects. And the
most recent manifestation of our commit
ment to communication can be seen in
the new and improved ASSU website. We
hope to institutionalize such mechanisms
so that when Joe Random is asked, what
does the ASSU do, he will respond, "They
fund student groups, uphold student
voice, and represent the manifold needs
and interests of the student body." Until
that day when Joe Random replies in this
way, the need for better communications
persists. A measure of our success is not
only what we do, but also how well we in
form students about what we do.
With all this said, we organized our
priorities into four categories in accor
dance with underlying ideals. We decid
ed to focus on arts, diversity, transporta
tion and the construction of a more re
sourceful association. While these phras
es seem to represent vague possibilities,
we will discuss how we have translated
each into tangible realities.
Let's start with the arts. In partner
ship with SOCA, we have launched a
program that will showcase mural art in

Tresidder while commissioning students
to investigate the deeper disparities that
underfund art programs and initiatives
on campus. In the same way that the
mural brings diverse people together to
express a common voice, a large part of
our time in office has been devoted to
building unity through diversity.
Our process to support diversity
began first with an ASSU Community
Team Diversity Task Force, which de
cided to revamp the Guest Professorship
Board (program started by the ASSU in
the '70s into the early '80s, calling for
more progressive voices on campus) and
help support the LEAD group in institu
tionalizing a Cultural Awareness Associ
ate in every dorm on campus. The Fac
ulty Diversity Task Force intends to be a
multi-year task force, each year address
ing one phase of faculty diversity (e.g.
Recruitment, retention, tracking).
In addition to these areas, there are
other noteworthy accomplishments of
the year. The rationale behind our thirst
for transportation improvement re
volves around the need to bridge the
gap between Stanford and its surround
ing community. In this spirit, in the fol
lowing weeks, we will be working with
Housing and Dining Enterprises to im
plement a pilot fora News Readership
Program. For the first time ever, Stan
ford students can have convenient ac
cess to local and national newspapers
and empowerment to stay educated
about various issues.
For the first time ever, undergradu
ates and graduate students were able to
sit down together at the annual Thanks
giving Dinner. More than 1300 mem
bers of the Stanford community con
versed over enjoyment of free roast
turkey, mashed and sweet potatoes, sal
ads and pumpkin pie with dollops of
cream. This serves as one shining exam
ple of how the ASSU can internally work
together to serve the needs of both grad
uate and undergraduate students. Such
resourcefulness includes the under
graduate senate.
This year's Senate can be character
ized by diligence and sense of duty. The

appropriations committee continues to
fund hundreds of student groups. After
all, you can't have fun without funds. The
advocacy committee has organized
events such as A Night of Comedy, in ad
dition to supporting many organizations
and communities with word and action.
The student life committee has re
launched the Stanford Saver Program to
negotiate discounts with local vendors so
that Stanford students might face a finan
cially friendlier off-campus experience.
The Graduate Student Council has
continued to serve graduate students by
combining programming and advocacy
to meet the needs of Stanford's graduate
students. Just recently, they completed
their Quality of Life Survey Report,
which unveiled the conditions,
thoughts, and recommendations of over
2000 graduate students.
In addition, the senate has worked to
improve Tresidder with short-term and
long-term proposals while maintaining
service staples such as Online Course
(inicle, Online Draw Guide and Student
Initiated Courses.
There was once a day when the
ASSU owned and operated various
businesses such as the CoHo, and
elected senators simultaneously
sought to generate profit while serving
as champions of various campus is
sues. I hat day has expired, and now
Stanford Student Enterprises, com
bined with the ASSU endowment,
have provided and continue to pro
vide the financial support necessary to
ensure the long-term financial viability
of the organization.
The promise of the 112 uture rests in the
eggs of today. We must hatch our stu
dent voices.
