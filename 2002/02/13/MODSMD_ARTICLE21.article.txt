KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) —
Police arrested a British-born Is
lamic militant yesterday they say
masterminded the kidnapping of
Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel
Pearl — the biggest break yet in the
quest to free him. An official close to
the investigation said the suspect
told police Pearl is alive.
Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh,
27, was arrested Tuesday after
noon in the eastern city of Lahore,
according to Tasneem Noorani, a
senior official of Pakistan's Interior
Ministry. Saeed was flown to
Karachi late last night for further
questioning, the government news
agency reported.
Following the arrest, police
fanned out across this city of 14
million people, raiding homes of
suspected Islamic extremists and
searching settlements along the
bleak and thinly populated Pak
istani coast. Police cautioned that
rescuing Pearl could still take time.
Saeed "is one who is highly ed
ucated and one who I would feel is
a hard nut to crack," Karachi Po
lice Chief Kamal Shah said. "I
don't think it would be very easy to
break him straight away. It would
take time I feel before we get all the
details about Daniel from his
interrogation."
Pearl, 38, the Journal's South
Asia bureau chief, disappeared
Jan. 23 on his way to meet with Is
lamic extremist contacts. He was
believed working on a story about
links between Pakistani militants
and Richard C. Reid, the man ac
cused of trying to detonate explo
sives hidden in his sneakers on a

Paris-to-Miami flight in Decem
ber.
Jamil Yousuf, head of a citizen
police liaison committee involved
in the investigation, said the
bearded, bespectacled Saeed told
police that threats to kill Pearl
were not carried out. "He's alive.
He's okay," Yousuf quoted Saeed
as saying of Pearl.
Yousuf said the key break came
Monday night with the arrest of a
suspect in the capital of Islamabad
who gave crucial information.
Yousuf did not elaborate.
Several more arrests were re
ported in Karachi, Rawalpindi
and other major cities Tuesday.
In Washington, White House
spokesman An Fleischer said he
could not confirm any details
about Saeed's arrest or Pearl's re
ported condition. However, he
said that cooperation by Pakistani
authorities "has been very strong
and very helpful" in the Pearl case.
Saeed was arrested in India in
1994 in connection with the kid
napping of three British backpack
ers in Kashmir. The kidnappers
demanded the release of Islamic
militants fighting to end Indian
rule in the contested Himalayan
region. Saeed was shot and
wounded by police and the
hostages were freed unharmed.
He spent the next five years in
jail — although never brought to
trial — and was freed in Decem
ber 1999 after gunmen hijacked
an Indian Airlines jet to Kanda
har, Afghanistan, and demanded
the release of Saeed and other
figures.
