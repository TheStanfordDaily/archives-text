## 'Wiggy' still a star Senior leads synchronized swimming team in her final season on the Farm 
### ASHLEY ENSIGN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the only senior, Lindsey Wigginton is
the veteran of the Stanford synchro team,
and she is also a veteran to the sport. Wig
ginton has been doing synchro for almost
16 years.
Wigginton began her synchro career in
1987 at the age of six, swimming fora club
team, the Chula Vista Dolphinettes. She
swam with that team until 1990 and then
switched to the San Diego Sweetwater Dol
phins, where she swam until coming to Stan
ford in 1998.
Wigginton also excelled at water polo and
speed swimming during middle school and
high school, and even made the junior Na
tional Water Polo team. She was voted the
best all-around girls water polo player every
year of high school and the most valuable
player on her varsity swim team.
Wigginton was addicted to the pool.
She juggled all three sports, but when
faced with a decision, she always chose syn
chro first.
"I enjoyed water polo and swim team,"
said Wigginton. "But I love synchro because
it's also a performance. I love performing for
an audience and I didn't have that when I
played water polo or did swim team."
At a young age, Wigginton had already
set goals for herself that extended well into
the future. As a 10-year-old, she knew that
she wanted to go the Olympics. She began
working her way in that direction, practic
ing a minimum of five days a week, four
hours a day.

Wigginton's practice paid off". She swam
on the U.S. Junior National Team for three
years, and has now swam on the U.S. Senior
National Team for four years.
Qualifying for the U.S. Junior Na
tional team for the first time in 1995 was
one of the most exciting accomplish
ments for Wigginton.
It was her first step toward achieving her
ultimate Olympic goal. Making the senior
National Team for the first time in 1998 was
even more encouraging. In 2000, Wiggin
ton placed in the top 20 at the Olympic trials.
At Stanford, Wigginton has contributed
greatly to the team's success. Wigginton con
sistently scores the highest in elements and
her routines almost always win first place.
She is a leader on the team and someone to
learn from.
"I admire Wiggy because she gives every
thing she has to this team," said sophomore
Jennifer Kibler. "Even when she is injured
or sick, she gets in the pool and practices like
it is any other day. I don't know how she does
it sometimes."
While Wigginton has been important to
the team's success, she has also enjoyed her
role as a team player.
"Swimming for Stanford has been really
great because collegiate synchro is more of a
team sport, in contrast to the national level,
which is more individual," W 7 igginton said.
"The team's success is the most important.
That's neat for me because that was some
thing I really likecl about water polo, the
team camaraderie."
This is Wigginton's last year swimming
for the Cardinal and she will be missed in the
pool next year.
However, she will not be a stranger in the
synchro world.
If everything goes according to plan and
Wiggy continues to swim as she has, she will
be on the Olympic team in 2004.
