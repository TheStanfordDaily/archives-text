# Marco leaves lasting mark on the Farm

### JONATHAN STULL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Six or 10 or 14 years from now, some perfectly
manicured and coiffured NBC correspondent will
introduce the following story to the world.
Coming as it will, amid a flurry of teary, inspira
tional biographies, this current Stanford junior's
journey to Beijing or San Francisco or some other
potential Olympic city might be rendered boring.
When extraordinary people are grouped together,
their exploits often appear merely ordinary.
But, even at Stanford, which fancies itself as com
pendium of all that is excellent, the 20-year-old
archer is clearly impressive.
As a kid, Michelle Marco said, "I wanted to be
a runner."
But, in kindergarten she accidentally fell off a loft
and suffered a permanent injury to her back. The
doctors told Marco that she would never be able to
engage in any sport that would place undue strain on
her back. So, no mo' Flojo.
Then, at age five, she was put into the wrong elec
tive class at summer camp. Marco wanted to do pot
tery with the rest of the kindergartners. Instead, she
wound up with a bow in her hand.
Though she found it fun and was told by her in
structors that her results showed promise, Marco
didn't really start shooting again until she was
eight, when she tried out for the San Diego Junior
Olympic team.
Her potential earned her a spot and 12 years later,
after traveling with her parents to competitions

Michelle Marco poses with her favorite weapon. The junior is the
founder of Stanford's Archery Club and is the three-time women's
collegiate champion.
around the country and trekking
hours every day to practice at one
of the few ranges near her SoCal
home, she's one of the top female
archers in the country. Marco has
won the California Collegiate
Championships three years in a
row - this year by a massive 112
points - and won the West Region
al the past two years. Unfortu
nately, she might not make the trip
to regionals this year.
"Sept. 11 has really made it hard
to travel with a deadly weapon,"
Marco said seriously, referring to
her powerful Yamaha bow, high
powered sight and quiver of arrows.
But, for all her success, the
Olympics have been pushed to
the side.
In 1998, Michelle's family de
bated whether she should take off
her senior year in high school and
the following year to isolate her
self with the U.S. archery team in
Colorado Springs. Another
young archer, with whom Marco
liad competed on an even scale
for years, went to the Olympic
Training Center for two years,
made the U.S. team and compet
ed in Australia.
"How many people are offered
the chance?" Marco said she asked

herself. "I feel like it's my duty to
go to the Olympics."
Just not yet. Marco, whose par
ents met while attending Stanford
Law School, decided to go to col
lege first. And, then, she should
maybe law school. And, then,
maybe work fora while.
"[Archery] is an intellectual chal
lenge, but I'd be bored shooting all
the time," said Marco, an art history
major and Cedro's resident tutor.
The nature of the sport made
the decision much easier for her.
While gymnasts and figure skaters
must sacrifice their prepubescent
lives fora shot at the gold medal,
archery has had Olympic competi
tors as old as age 66. Marco holds
up actress Geena Davis, who fa
mously picked up a bow late in life
before attempting to qualify for the
2000 team, as an example of the
sport's openness.
"Archery is so accessible - open
to all ages and all body builds,"
Marco said. "It's all about disci
pline and practice, not just God
given ability. It's a great sport that
gets overlooked."
Even here at Stanford, which
lacks a varsity team.
Marco thought about going to
Columbia or Texas A&M, home to
the nation's finest collegiate pro
gram. But, she decided she could
be successful wherever she went.
"Stanford doesn't have a team,
but I loved it so much that I had to

come," she said.
She never gave up the bow and
arrow, though. Soon after arriving
on the Farm, Marco started die
Archery Club. The club is technical
ly a student organization; club
sports must have significant partici
pation for three years as an organi
zation before they can receive Rind
ing. The extensive roadblocks - no
range close enough, not enough
money, not enough inherent inter
est - probably mean it will remain
that way.
That doesn't fully deter Marco.
She stays active and keeps shooting.
She lifts weights and does cardiovas
cular exercise to build up the stami
na needed for long competitions.
She's also working on getting her
self so finely tuned that she can time
her shots perfectly between heart
beats, in order to eliminate any un
necessary body movement. When
standing 70 meters away from a
bulls-eye that's less than six centime
ters wide, such accuracy is impor
tant.
So, as the Olympic bonanza
skates all around us, Marco keeps
her life in perspective, enjoying her
time as a student and a harpist "I'm
a string person" is all she can offer
in mock defense.
But, she still remains focused on
the future so that, eventually, when
the time is right, she can earn her
self a room at the Olympic Village.
Bob Costas can't wait.

given ability. It's a great sport that
gets overlooked."
Even here at Stanford, which
lacks a varsity team.
Marco thought about going to
Columbia or Texas A&M, home to
the nation's finest collegiate pro
gram. But, she decided she could
be successful wherever she went.
"Stanford doesn't have a team,
but I loved it so much that I had to

come," she said.
She never gave up the bow and
arrow, though. Soon after arriving
on the Farm, Marco started die
Archery Club. The club is technical
ly a student organization; club
sports must have significant partici
pation for three years as an organi
zation before they can receive Rind
ing. The extensive roadblocks - no
range close enough, not enough
money, not enough inherent inter
est - probably mean it will remain
that way.
That doesn't fully deter Marco.
She stays active and keeps shooting.
She lifts weights and does cardiovas
cular exercise to build up the stami
na needed for long competitions.
She's also working on getting her
self so finely tuned that she can time
her shots perfectly between heart
beats, in order to eliminate any un
necessary body movement. When
standing 70 meters away from a
bulls-eye that's less than six centime
ters wide, such accuracy is impor
tant.
So, as the Olympic bonanza
skates all around us, Marco keeps
her life in perspective, enjoying her
time as a student and a harpist "I'm
a string person" is all she can offer
in mock defense.
But, she still remains focused on
the future so that, eventually, when
the time is right, she can earn her
self a room at the Olympic Village.
Bob Costas can't wait.
Six or 10 or 14 years from now, some perfectly
manicured and coiffured NBC correspondent will
introduce the following story to the world.
Coming as it will, amid a flurry of teary, inspira
tional biographies, this current Stanford junior's
journey to Beijing or San Francisco or some other
potential Olympic city might be rendered boring.
When extraordinary people are grouped together,
their exploits often appear merely ordinary.
But, even at Stanford, which fancies itself as com
pendium of all that is excellent, the 20-year-old
archer is clearly impressive.
As a kid, Michelle Marco said, "I wanted to be
a runner."
But, in kindergarten she accidentally fell off a loft
and suffered a permanent injury to her back. The
doctors told Marco that she would never be able to
engage in any sport that would place undue strain on
her back. So, no mo' Flojo.
Then, at age five, she was put into the wrong elec
tive class at summer camp. Marco wanted to do pot
tery with the rest of the kindergartners. Instead, she
wound up with a bow in her hand.
Though she found it fun and was told by her in
structors that her results showed promise, Marco
didn't really start shooting again until she was
eight, when she tried out for the San Diego Junior
Olympic team.
Her potential earned her a spot and 12 years later,
after traveling with her parents to competitions

Michelle Marco poses with her favorite weapon. The junior is the
founder of Stanford's Archery Club and is the three-time women's
collegiate champion.
around the country and trekking
hours every day to practice at one
of the few ranges near her SoCal
home, she's one of the top female
archers in the country. Marco has
won the California Collegiate
Championships three years in a
row - this year by a massive 112
points - and won the West Region
al the past two years. Unfortu
nately, she might not make the trip
to regionals this year.
"Sept. 11 has really made it hard
to travel with a deadly weapon,"
Marco said seriously, referring to
her powerful Yamaha bow, high
powered sight and quiver of arrows.
But, for all her success, the
Olympics have been pushed to
the side.
In 1998, Michelle's family de
bated whether she should take off
her senior year in high school and
the following year to isolate her
self with the U.S. archery team in
Colorado Springs. Another
young archer, with whom Marco
liad competed on an even scale
for years, went to the Olympic
Training Center for two years,
made the U.S. team and compet
ed in Australia.
"How many people are offered
the chance?" Marco said she asked

herself. "I feel like it's my duty to
go to the Olympics."
Just not yet. Marco, whose par
ents met while attending Stanford
Law School, decided to go to col
lege first. And, then, she should
maybe law school. And, then,
maybe work fora while.
"[Archery] is an intellectual chal
lenge, but I'd be bored shooting all
the time," said Marco, an art history
major and Cedro's resident tutor.
The nature of the sport made
the decision much easier for her.
While gymnasts and figure skaters
must sacrifice their prepubescent
lives fora shot at the gold medal,
archery has had Olympic competi
tors as old as age 66. Marco holds
up actress Geena Davis, who fa
mously picked up a bow late in life
before attempting to qualify for the
2000 team, as an example of the
sport's openness.
"Archery is so accessible - open
to all ages and all body builds,"
Marco said. "It's all about disci
pline and practice, not just God
given ability. It's a great sport that
gets overlooked."
