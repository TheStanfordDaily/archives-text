# Marco leaves lasting mark on the Farm

### JONATHAN STULL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Six or 10 or 14 years from now, some perfectly
manicured and coiffured NBC correspondent will
introduce the following story to the world.
Coming as it will, amid a flurry of teary, inspira
tional biographies, this current Stanford junior's
journey to Beijing or San Francisco or some other
potential Olympic city might be rendered boring.
When extraordinary people are grouped together,
their exploits often appear merely ordinary.
But, even at Stanford, which fancies itself as com
pendium of all that is excellent, the 20-year-old
archer is clearly impressive.
As a kid, Michelle Marco said, "I wanted to be
a runner."
But, in kindergarten she accidentally fell off a loft
and suffered a permanent injury to her back. The
doctors told Marco that she would never be able to
engage in any sport that would place undue strain on
her back. So, no mo' Flojo.
Then, at age five, she was put into the wrong elec
tive class at summer camp. Marco wanted to do pot
tery with the rest of the kindergartners. Instead, she
wound up with a bow in her hand.
Though she found it fun and was told by her in
structors that her results showed promise, Marco
didn't really start shooting again until she was
eight, when she tried out for the San Diego Junior
Olympic team.
Her potential earned her a spot and 12 years later,
after traveling with her parents to competitions
