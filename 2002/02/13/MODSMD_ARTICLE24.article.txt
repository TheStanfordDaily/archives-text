# Card starts season off right, at home
## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
water polo team opened up its sea
son the same way it began its record
setting 2001 campaign, with a cham
pionship in the Stanford Invitation
this weekend.
The Cardinal went 4-0 in the two
days of action, with victories over UC-
Davis, Southern California, UC-Santa
Barbara and UCLA.
The title game featured Stanford

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford 9, UCLA 4

against top-seeded UCLA in a rematch
of last years NCAA championship game.
The defending national champion Bru
ins could not repeat last year's victory,
as the Cardinal won the match 9-4 and
earned its second consecutive champi
onship in its home tournament.
The Cardinal jumped out quickly as
senior Ellen Estes, sophomore Brenda
Villa and junior Julie Gardner found

the back of the net, giving Stanford a 3-
0 lead. UCLA responded, however, to
cut its deficit to two, as the match en
tered halftime at 4-2.
After a goal by senior Margie Din
geldein was answered quickly by a
UCLA goal in the third quarter, Stan
ford put the game out of reach with
four goals in the fourth quarter, im
proving the score to 9-3 with only two
minutes remaining.
"We had to treat this game the
same as any other game for us,"
said head coach John Tanner.
"We're a new team and UCLA
is a great team this year. They
have great balance and depth.
It ended up being a one-sided
game, but it was close up until
the fourth quarter when we
sealed the victory."
In its earlier games on Satur
day, the Cardinal defeated UC-
Davis 13-2 and USC 8-5.
Against the Aggies, the Cardi
nal scored five goals in the first
quarter, including Villa's first two
goals of the season, en route to its
easy win.
Sophomore Wendy Watkins
stepped up against the Trojans with
three goals and Estes scored twice
for the second time that day.
Overall on the weekend, the
Cardinal outscored its oppo
nents 44-15. Villa led the team
in scoring with 10 goals while
Estes added six.
"I think we played really good
team defense and we attacked
well as a team," Tanner said. "We
scored our goals in lots of situa
tions and from different places in
the pool. On defense all 13 play
ers played cohesively. Jackie did a
great job in the goal and we

played tight two-meter defense."
"One thing you never know
about your team is how they will
play in competition," Tanner
said. "We were very tough this
weekend and proved what our
team could do in real games."
The tournament not only al
lowed the Cardinal to see how it
would play as a team, but also
allowed Stanford to size up its
competition. Many of the Car
dinal's opponents from the

Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation participated, including top
seeded UCLA, third-seeded USC,
and fourth-seeded California.
In other head-to-head com
petition, UCLA defeated Cal in
a close 5-4 match In the third
place game, the Tr oj an s
notched the Bears 7-5.
The Cardinal will return to
action in two weeks as it de
fends its title in the UC-Santa
Barbara tournament.
