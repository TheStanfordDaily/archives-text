Strong Cardinal performances in a wide range
of events gave the Stanford men a fourth-place
and the women a third-place finish at New York's
Armory Invitational.

TRACK & FIELD
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford competes in the Holi
day Inn Classic, all day, Reno, NV
Sunday: Women placed third with 1 24 points;
Men finished in fourth place with 103 points at the
Mountain West Pac-10 Challenge.

Junior Grant Robison took the mile with a time of 4
minutes, 00.73 seconds. Seth Hejny added another in
dividual win for the Cardinal, taking the 3,000 meters
with 7:59.91.
Junior Milton Little added points in the jumps,
placing fifth in the long jump with a mark of 23 feet
- 11.5 inches.
Adding points for the Cardinal was junior Nick
Welihozkiy, a consistently strong performer in the
throws. He took third in the weight throw with a toss of
66-08.00.
The men's distance medley relay team lit up the
track, blazing to a win in a time of 9:35.75.
Junior Grant Robison, sophomore Don Sage, ju
nior Seth Hejny and freshman Curtis Goehring
ran the 1,600, 1,200, 800 and 400-meter legs of the
relay, respectively.
The Cardinal women had a remarkable nine ath
letes finish in the top ten in their event.
Continuing her outstanding season with a victory in
the shot put, sophomore Jillian Camarena recorded a
throw 0f53*07.00.
Junior Lauren Fleshman, billed as one of the meet's
top athletes to watch, did not disappoint, winning the
mile in 4:38.48.
The Stanford women had a particularly strong
showing in the 3,000 meters, as junior Melindi El
more (9:28.01), seniors Laura Turner (9:29.82) and
Caroline Annis (9:37.39) took second, fourth and
eighth, respectively.
Also contributing in the third-place team effort were

Junior Omer Inan stays in good form with this javelin throw. But it was in the
shot put where Inan had his best showing, placing sixth at the Mountain
West-Pac-10 Challenge.
senior Maurica Carlucci, who took
fourth in the 800 meters (2:08.37)
and junior Kathleen Donoghue,
who placed second in the pole
vault with a jump of 12-09.5
While most Stanford athletes
competed in the Big Apple,
Cardinal action was not limited
to New York.
Since no 5,000-meter run was
held at Armory, Cardinal athletes
seeking NCAA qualifying times in
that event headed to Butler Uni
versity in Indianapolis for the Can
non Classic.
Sophomore Chris Emme won

the 5K in a blistering 14:00.67,
with junior Louis Luchini placing
second in 14:01.21. Sophomore
lan Dobson took seventh with a
time of 14:14.82.
Emme hung with the leaders
until the rabbit (a runner who
leads and sets an even pace fora
while with no intention of finishing
the race) dropped out, then con
trolled the final laps, holding off
teammate Luchini's late charge.
"It was much easier having a
rabbit," said Emme. "That kept the
splits even."
Emme's and Luchini's times
will likely earn them spots in the
NCAA Indoor Championships.
Back on the West Coast,
freshman Sara Bei ran a spec
tacular race at the Junior Na

tional Cross Country Champi
onships, held in Oregon.
Bei covered the 6-kilometer
cross country course in 21:06,
placing third and earning a
spot on the national team that
will represent the United States
in the junior World Cross
Country Championships.
The short indoor track season is
quickly drawing to a close.
Only this weekend's Holiday
Inn Classic in Reno, Nev. remains
for athletes to obtain qualifying
marks before the championship
portion of the season begins.
The Holiday Inn Classic will
be followed by the MPSF In
door Championships, the
USATF Championships, and fi
nally the NCAAs.
