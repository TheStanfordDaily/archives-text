# Stanford falls short in L. A.
## 
### SARAH LINDSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a rough road loss to No. 10
UCIA (6-4,2-1 Pacific 10 Conference) on
Sunday, I he (Cardinal's solid showing and
overall high scores helped the team to
hold on to its No. 7 ranking. Stanford (4-
2, 4-1 Pac-10) is the highest-rated Pac-10
squad in this week's national rankings.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
Friday: No. 7 Stanford competes
against No. 1 4 Florida, No. 1 9 Penn
State and Illinois-Chicago in
Gainsville, Fla., 4 p.m. PST
Sunday: No. 7 Stanford 195.025,
No. 11 UCLA 196.925

Other Pac-10 schools in the rankings
include No. 10 UCLA, No. 11 Arizona,
No. 16 Arizona State and No. 21 Oregon
State. The Cardinal is the highest-ranked
perhaps, but still not at the top of its
game, as witnessed in the 196.925-
195.025 loss.
"There were some up and down
moments in UCLA this weekend, but I
was actually very pleased with the
overall energy of the team," senior
Becky Meldrum said.
T his energy is reflected not only in
the team's national rankings, but also
in personal rankings held by individ
ual team members.
Sophomore Lindsay Wing captured
seventh in the country on the balance
beam. At No. 14 on the uneven bars sits
Meldrum, while sophomore Caroline
Fluhrer grasped No. 19 on the vault.
Stanford is currently ranked No. 3 on
the balance beam and No. 6 on the un
even bars. The Cardinal ranks No. 8 on

the vault and No. 19 on the floor exercise.
With Stanford showing so well nation
ally, it is surprising that the Cardinal let
this meet against UCLA slip through
its fingers.
"I think as a team we performed well,
but not great," Fluhrer said. "Steps on
landings and other minor deductions re
ally added up; I think it's just frustrating
to know that we could have and should
have shown everyone how much we've
improved this year."
I improvements t his year include addi
tional moves and new landings. Senior
Katy Herbert completed a new move to
her vault, while Meldrum stuck a new
landing on the bars.
"Becky had an awesome bar routine,
sticking her new dismount and Katy
nailed her new vault, which was great,"
Fluhrer said.
This Friday, the Cardinal will head
to Florida in the Sun Trust Mardi Gras
Madness Competition. Going into this
weekend's matchup against No. 14
Florida, No. 19 Penn State and Illinois-
Chicago, Stanford just needs to con
centrate on the little things to get back
in the swing of top performances.
"For Florida, I think we just need to
focus more on details and landings to fur
ther accent our already solid routines,"
Fluhrer said.
Stanford's competitors this weekend
are all coming offof big meets. Florida (6-
5) nearly upset No. 4 Oklahoma on the
road in a close 194.475-193.925 loss.

out there competing that we need

head coach Kristen Smyth.
The upsetting loss to UCLA
doesn't seem to have affected

"After getting home late on
Sunday night, the team came into

go on Monday," Meldrum said.

Sunday: No. 7 Stanford 195.025,
No. 11 UCLA 196.925

Other Pac-10 schools in the rankings
include No. 10 UCLA, No. 11 Arizona,
No. 16 Arizona State and No. 21 Oregon
State. The Cardinal is the highest-ranked
perhaps, but still not at the top of its
game, as witnessed in the 196.925-
195.025 loss.
"There were some up and down
moments in UCLA this weekend, but I
was actually very pleased with the
overall energy of the team," senior
Becky Meldrum said.
T his energy is reflected not only in
the team's national rankings, but also
in personal rankings held by individ
ual team members.
Sophomore Lindsay Wing captured
seventh in the country on the balance
beam. At No. 14 on the uneven bars sits
Meldrum, while sophomore Caroline
Fluhrer grasped No. 19 on the vault.
Stanford is currently ranked No. 3 on
the balance beam and No. 6 on the un
even bars. The Cardinal ranks No. 8 on

the vault and No. 19 on the floor exercise.
With Stanford showing so well nation
ally, it is surprising that the Cardinal let
this meet against UCLA slip through
its fingers.
"I think as a team we performed well,
but not great," Fluhrer said. "Steps on
landings and other minor deductions re
ally added up; I think it's just frustrating
to know that we could have and should
have shown everyone how much we've
improved this year."
I improvements t his year include addi
tional moves and new landings. Senior
Katy Herbert completed a new move to
her vault, while Meldrum stuck a new
landing on the bars.
"Becky had an awesome bar routine,
sticking her new dismount and Katy
nailed her new vault, which was great,"
Fluhrer said.
This Friday, the Cardinal will head
to Florida in the Sun Trust Mardi Gras
Madness Competition. Going into this
weekend's matchup against No. 14
Florida, No. 19 Penn State and Illinois-
Chicago, Stanford just needs to con
centrate on the little things to get back
in the swing of top performances.
"For Florida, I think we just need to
focus more on details and landings to fur
ther accent our already solid routines,"
Fluhrer said.
Stanford's competitors this weekend
are all coming offof big meets. Florida (6-
5) nearly upset No. 4 Oklahoma on the
road in a close 194.475-193.925 loss.

doesn't seem to have affected
the Cardinal's spirits for this

looking forward to a sweep of
Florida, Penn State, and Illinois-
Chicago this coming Friday."
