### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an unusual grand finale to his
question-and-answer session with
the ASSU, about 45 black-clad stu
dents, some carrying signs such as
"Fight the Injustice" and"I will do
whatever it takes," con lion ted Uni
versity President John Hennessy
over labor issues.
Despite original plans for solely
ASSU officers to ask the 12 ques
tions submitted to Hennessy be
fore the meeting, the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition was per
mitted to ask Hennessy about
Stanford labor policy.
Spokespeople for the group ad
dressed the issue of a "prevailing
wage" for non-union workers
rather than the $10.10 per hour
"living wage" plan Hennessy pre
sented at a Faculty Senate meeting.
The coalition wondered why this
policy was formed without hearing
student and worker input despite
what they said were assurances to
the contrary.
"Worker voices weren't at the
table," said Clara Webb, a junior.
"Student voices weren't at the
table."
"The basic issue here is why are
they shutting out the students and
the workers," said Danielle Ma
hones, organizing director of SFIU
Local 715. "Why won't he meet
with them?"
Hennessy, for his part, expressed
confusion at the new demands. "I
understood the students wanted a
living wage policy," he said. "We
tried to craft the outline of a policy
that was responsive to those issues."
The policy was not in its final
form, he said, and the University

was open to input.
The group asked Hennessy if he
would approve a code of conduct
for workers. "I'm not committing to
implementing a code of conduct
that I haven't seen," Hennessy re
sponded.
Protestors felt that the decision
would cause union jobs to be re
placed by cheaper, subcontracted
workers, and called for subcontract
ed workers to have a wage equal to
union workers.
"We've set a policy that deals with
subcontracting," Hennessy said.
... It does not concern unionized
workers...We did not feel it appro
priate to interfere with the bargain

ing unit process .. .This is a princi
ple we've stuck to."
"We tried to tackle in good fath
what we saw as the primary issue
raised by students," Hennessy said,
"and the moral issue, living wage"
"You misunderstood this discus
sion completely," said Lolita Robial,
ajunior.
"Decisions have to be made to
run the University," Hennessy
said. "This is a decision that 1 have
... I have to take personal respon
sibility for the budget implications
of that decision."
"We don't feel the policy needs to
