# Hennessy meets with students
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an unusual grand finale to his
question-and-answer session with
the ASSU, about 45 black-clad stu
dents, some carrying signs such as
"Fight the Injustice" and"I will do
whatever it takes," con lion ted Uni
versity President John Hennessy
over labor issues.
Despite original plans for solely
ASSU officers to ask the 12 ques
tions submitted to Hennessy be
fore the meeting, the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition was per
mitted to ask Hennessy about
Stanford labor policy.
Spokespeople for the group ad
dressed the issue of a "prevailing
wage" for non-union workers
rather than the $10.10 per hour
"living wage" plan Hennessy pre
sented at a Faculty Senate meeting.
The coalition wondered why this
policy was formed without hearing
student and worker input despite
what they said were assurances to
the contrary.
"Worker voices weren't at the
table," said Clara Webb, a junior.
"Student voices weren't at the
table."
"The basic issue here is why are
they shutting out the students and
the workers," said Danielle Ma
hones, organizing director of SFIU
Local 715. "Why won't he meet
with them?"
Hennessy, for his part, expressed
confusion at the new demands. "I
understood the students wanted a
living wage policy," he said. "We
tried to craft the outline of a policy
that was responsive to those issues."
The policy was not in its final
form, he said, and the University

was open to input.
The group asked Hennessy if he
would approve a code of conduct
for workers. "I'm not committing to
implementing a code of conduct
that I haven't seen," Hennessy re
sponded.
Protestors felt that the decision
would cause union jobs to be re
placed by cheaper, subcontracted
workers, and called for subcontract
ed workers to have a wage equal to
union workers.
"We've set a policy that deals with
subcontracting," Hennessy said.
... It does not concern unionized
workers...We did not feel it appro
priate to interfere with the bargain

ing unit process .. .This is a princi
ple we've stuck to."
"We tried to tackle in good fath
what we saw as the primary issue
raised by students," Hennessy said,
"and the moral issue, living wage"
"You misunderstood this discus
sion completely," said Lolita Robial,
ajunior.
"Decisions have to be made to
run the University," Hennessy
said. "This is a decision that 1 have
... I have to take personal respon
sibility for the budget implications
of that decision."

come on the back of the workers,"
Webb said.
"I never make a decision disre
garding the needs of someone who
works on this campus," Hennessy
said emphatically. "We already
pay every employee more than liv
ing wage."
Eventially, ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate Chair Alex Shvartsman, a
senior, addressed the debate, asking
that the increasingly emotional ar
guement be kept civil. "This will not
turn into a discussion about this
issue specifically," he said. "This is
not the focus of this meeting at all."
I'he meeting closed with the
group exiting and chanting
"President Hennessy, choose ac
countability."
The event was discussed at the
.ASSU Undergraduate Senate meet
ing immediately afterward.
"You did yourself a real disser
vice tonight because you set him
up," said Associate Dean of Students
Morris Graves, who said he was
speaking as the Senate advisor. He
asked the senators to put themselves

in the place of Hennessy and imag
ine themselves standing alone in
front of an angry Faculty Senate. In
addition, he said, the Senate showed
it could not be trusted, and the
events of the meeting may jeopar
dize the fiiiture question-and-an
swer session planned with Provost
John Etchemendy.
I hough some senators knew
that the coalition would be asking
the question at the event, the disin
tegration into a Hennessy-coalition
debate was unplanned.
"What happened today was in no
way an ASSU attempt to set him
up," Shvartsman said. "He was pre
pared to answer questions with re
spect to the general topic. Their for
mat deviated from the 'Q-and-A'
session into a stream of demands."
ASSU Vice President Christine
Cordero, a senior, agreed. She
urged Senators to put their per
sonal feelings aside and talk to
leaders on both sides of the issue
carefully, noting that it ran deeper
than appeared.
Several senators noted that they
had no idea that the Coalition would
present the question, and won
dered why they weren't informed
the group would be appearing.
A number of non-ASSU person

ell, did ask both follow-up and pre
submitted questions, noted Senator
Sonrisa Lucero, a junior. "1 think
they should have been allowed to
ask that question," she said.
The Senate resolved last quarter
to show support for die labor cam
paign and Senators noted that they
had the right to bring the students
they represented to speak.
Senate Associate Brigitte Zim
merman, a freshman, said that no
body disagreed with the students'
right to speak, but she challenged
the "scare tactics" of the group's ac
tions. "They all stood up, they all
wore black," she said. "The only
person smiling in the entire room
was Hennessy."
In contrast, Mahones said,"l
think the issues and the way stu
dents raised the issues were very
clean and did a good job."
Workers would go to the next
meeting between students and ad
ministration, Mahones said, de
spite being told not to attend.
"We're planning to go," she said.
"Whether they let us in or not,
we'll see."
Other issues discussed at the
meeting included graduate student
housing and health care, as well as
campus diversity.

rather than the $10.10 per hour
"living wage" plan Hennessy pre
sented at a Faculty Senate meeting.
The coalition wondered why this
policy was formed without hearing
student and worker input despite
what they said were assurances to
the contrary.
"Worker voices weren't at the
table," said Clara Webb, a junior.
"Student voices weren't at the
table."
"The basic issue here is why are
they shutting out the students and
the workers," said Danielle Ma
hones, organizing director of SFIU
Local 715. "Why won't he meet
with them?"
Hennessy, for his part, expressed
confusion at the new demands. "I
understood the students wanted a
living wage policy," he said. "We
tried to craft the outline of a policy
that was responsive to those issues."
The policy was not in its final
form, he said, and the University

was open to input.
The group asked Hennessy if he
would approve a code of conduct
for workers. "I'm not committing to
implementing a code of conduct
that I haven't seen," Hennessy re
sponded.
Protestors felt that the decision
would cause union jobs to be re
placed by cheaper, subcontracted
workers, and called for subcontract
ed workers to have a wage equal to
union workers.
"We've set a policy that deals with
subcontracting," Hennessy said.
... It does not concern unionized
workers...We did not feel it appro
priate to interfere with the bargain

ajunior.

Webb said.
"I never make a decision disre
garding the needs of someone who
works on this campus," Hennessy
said emphatically. "We already
pay every employee more than liv
ing wage."
Eventially, ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate Chair Alex Shvartsman, a
senior, addressed the debate, asking
that the increasingly emotional ar
guement be kept civil. "This will not
turn into a discussion about this
issue specifically," he said. "This is
not the focus of this meeting at all."
I'he meeting closed with the
group exiting and chanting
"President Hennessy, choose ac
countability."
The event was discussed at the
.ASSU Undergraduate Senate meet
ing immediately afterward.
"You did yourself a real disser
vice tonight because you set him
up," said Associate Dean of Students
Morris Graves, who said he was
speaking as the Senate advisor. He
asked the senators to put themselves

in the place of Hennessy and imag
ine themselves standing alone in
front of an angry Faculty Senate. In
addition, he said, the Senate showed
it could not be trusted, and the
events of the meeting may jeopar
dize the fiiiture question-and-an
swer session planned with Provost
John Etchemendy.
I hough some senators knew
that the coalition would be asking
the question at the event, the disin
tegration into a Hennessy-coalition
debate was unplanned.
"What happened today was in no
way an ASSU attempt to set him
up," Shvartsman said. "He was pre
pared to answer questions with re
spect to the general topic. Their for
mat deviated from the 'Q-and-A'
session into a stream of demands."
ASSU Vice President Christine
Cordero, a senior, agreed. She
urged Senators to put their per
sonal feelings aside and talk to
leaders on both sides of the issue
carefully, noting that it ran deeper
than appeared.
Several senators noted that they
had no idea that the Coalition would
present the question, and won
dered why they weren't informed
the group would be appearing.
A number of non-ASSU person

ell, did ask both follow-up and pre
submitted questions, noted Senator
Sonrisa Lucero, a junior. "1 think
they should have been allowed to
ask that question," she said.
The Senate resolved last quarter
to show support for die labor cam
paign and Senators noted that they
had the right to bring the students
they represented to speak.
Senate Associate Brigitte Zim
merman, a freshman, said that no
body disagreed with the students'
right to speak, but she challenged
the "scare tactics" of the group's ac
tions. "They all stood up, they all
wore black," she said. "The only
person smiling in the entire room
was Hennessy."
In contrast, Mahones said,"l
think the issues and the way stu
dents raised the issues were very
clean and did a good job."
Workers would go to the next
meeting between students and ad
ministration, Mahones said, de
spite being told not to attend.
"We're planning to go," she said.
"Whether they let us in or not,
we'll see."
Other issues discussed at the
meeting included graduate student
housing and health care, as well as
campus diversity.

question-and-answer session with
the ASSU, about 45 black-clad stu

"Fight the Injustice" and"I will do

Despite original plans for solely
ASSU officers to ask the 12 ques

Labor Action Coalition was per

Stanford labor policy.
