# Band put on probation
## 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
In response to reports of inci
dents involving alcohol consump
tion, the Office of Student Activi
ties placed the Stanford Band on
alcohol probation last week.
Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves explained that
probation was selected as a
suitable measure by a group of
administrators.
"This was a collective decision.
It was a decision that [Asst. Dean
of Students] Nanci [Howe] and I,
in collaboration with some of our
colleagues . . . decided on,"
Graves said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
and representatives from the
Athletics Department were also
involved in the decision-mak
ing process.
Wais explained that issues that
had come to the University's at
tention suggested a need fora for
mal investigation of the Band.
"We did not seek out informa
tion regarding these incidents re
lated to the Band," Wais said. "We
received information and reports
from other offices on campus.
Once these incidents are reported,
it is our responsibility to follow up
on them."
According to him, the nature of
the issues at hand suggested that
alcohol probation was appropriate
for the situation.
"The incidents that have
been reported to us have all in
volved the misuse of alcohol,"
Wais said.
Howe agreed, citing fear on
the part of the University for the
safety of Band members and stu
dents as a factor that prompted
the decision.
"I think the concern is that

excessive alcohol consumption
seems to have put individuals at
risk," Howe said. "This is a con
cern on the most part for indi
viduals not to get put at harm."
Senior Mike Huijon, public
relations manager for the Band,
expressed dissatisfaction with
the decision, and said he did not
feel it was entirely warranted.
"Basically they feel that
there's been a history of inci
dents where the Band hasn't
followed the kind of proce
dures that they'd like us to fol
low," Huijon said. "I think I'd
say our most salient reaction is
probably disappointment. By
and large we feel that alcohol
probation as a punishment is
pretty harsh [and] we don't feel
that it's deserved."
As public relations manager,
Huijon serves as spokesperson
for the Band. He was not in
volved in last week's meeting in
which the decision was handed

down by the administration to
Band management. Band Man
ager Erich Eminhizer and Assis
tant Manager Aram Crepam,
both juniors, were present.
Huijon did explain, though,
that he felt the decision would
not adversely affect the Band.
"By and large, we're not neces
sarily happy about it, but we es
sentially feel fairly positive about
our prospects," he said. "We feel
that this will have a minimal im
pact on the essential character of
the band."
Wais said the decision would
not have an effect on the spirit of
the Band.
"We are looking to maintain
and strengthen the nature and
character of the Band, recogniz
ing the great spirit and energy
they contribute to campus life.
We do place one expectation on
them and all recognized student

The Stanford Band was put on probation last week for incidents involving
alcohol consumption. The decision was made by representatives from the
Office of Student Affairs and the Athletics Program.
groups â€” that they plan their ac
tivities thoughtfully to ensure the
safety of their members and other
members of the campus commu
nity," he said.
Wais said that he is one of the
Band's most dedicated fans, ex
plaining that he enjoys sitting
next to them at Stanford's athlet
ic events.
"They do great good things for
the University," Wais said. "The last
thing we want this to become is an
'Us vs. Them' dynamic. Everything
we do is with the best interests of the
Band in mind."
Howe agreed with Wais's state
ment, mentioning her own person
al fondness for the Band.
"I like the Band," she said.
"We're not saying that we don't
want the Band to have alcohol, that
we don't want them to have fun. But
sometimes, lines get crossed."
Wais, Howe and Graves
stressed that the decision was made
in an effort to hold the band ac
countable to the same standards as
other campus groups and individ
ual students.
Graves said the behavior that
prompted the decision to place the
Band 011 alcohol probation violat
ed California state regulations.
"Students don't realize that
when they serve alcohol to minors
they are in direct violation of a
state law and could be charged,"
he said.
Band members include minors
as well as students over 21.

Graves went on to explain
that alcohol probation does not
restrict the Band from throwing
parties, but it does prohibit it
from serving alcohol at all activ
ities under the period of the
probation.
"This doesn't mean that they
can't have parties," he said. "Al
cohol should not be die center
piece of an activity. When it does,
you have the danger of over-con
sumption."
The administration did not
specify the duration of the alcohol
probation.
"The length of the suspension
will be determined by how long it
takes for die University and the
Band to agree on solutions and put
them into place," Wais said.
Huijon said he was uncertain
that this will not be a long proba
tion. He explained that this is a
preliminary action, and that the
administration will review the
Band's status and make a more
far-reaching decision in the near
future.
"Whatever issues that [Student
Activities] has, we feel that we can
work with them to resolve those
issues," he said. "We're pretty
confident that with the review of
our status we'll see the probation
removed."
Wais and Graves both referred
to past examples of collaboration
between the administration and die
band that have resulted in changes
for the better.
"We had a much more success
ful Band run [this year]," Graves
said. "This came as a result of a
collective set of solutions we came
up with."
