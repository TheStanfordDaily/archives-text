# Band put on probation
## 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
In response to reports of inci
dents involving alcohol consump
tion, the Office of Student Activi
ties placed the Stanford Band on
alcohol probation last week.
Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves explained that
probation was selected as a
suitable measure by a group of
administrators.
"This was a collective decision.
It was a decision that [Asst. Dean
of Students] Nanci [Howe] and I,
in collaboration with some of our
colleagues . . . decided on,"
Graves said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
and representatives from the
Athletics Department were also
involved in the decision-mak
ing process.
Wais explained that issues that
had come to the University's at
tention suggested a need fora for
mal investigation of the Band.
"We did not seek out informa
tion regarding these incidents re
lated to the Band," Wais said. "We
received information and reports
from other offices on campus.
Once these incidents are reported,
it is our responsibility to follow up
on them."
According to him, the nature of
the issues at hand suggested that
alcohol probation was appropriate
for the situation.
"The incidents that have
been reported to us have all in
volved the misuse of alcohol,"
Wais said.
Howe agreed, citing fear on
the part of the University for the
safety of Band members and stu
dents as a factor that prompted
the decision.
"I think the concern is that

excessive alcohol consumption
seems to have put individuals at
risk," Howe said. "This is a con
cern on the most part for indi
viduals not to get put at harm."
Senior Mike Huijon, public
relations manager for the Band,
expressed dissatisfaction with
the decision, and said he did not
feel it was entirely warranted.
"Basically they feel that
there's been a history of inci
dents where the Band hasn't
followed the kind of proce
dures that they'd like us to fol
low," Huijon said. "I think I'd
say our most salient reaction is
probably disappointment. By
and large we feel that alcohol
probation as a punishment is
pretty harsh [and] we don't feel
that it's deserved."
As public relations manager,
Huijon serves as spokesperson
for the Band. He was not in
volved in last week's meeting in
which the decision was handed

down by the administration to
Band management. Band Man
ager Erich Eminhizer and Assis
tant Manager Aram Crepam,
both juniors, were present.
Huijon did explain, though,
that he felt the decision would
not adversely affect the Band.
"By and large, we're not neces
sarily happy about it, but we es
sentially feel fairly positive about
our prospects," he said. "We feel
that this will have a minimal im
pact on the essential character of
the band."
Wais said the decision would
not have an effect on the spirit of
the Band.
"We are looking to maintain
and strengthen the nature and
character of the Band, recogniz
ing the great spirit and energy
they contribute to campus life.
We do place one expectation on
them and all recognized student
