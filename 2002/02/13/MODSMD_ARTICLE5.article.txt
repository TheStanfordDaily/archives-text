# Teevens talks football

### JONATHAN STULL MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
Last week. The Daily sat
down fora discussion with the
Cardinal's smiling, enthusias
tic new head football coach,
Buddy Teevens.
While he spent much of his
time on the road last month fi
nalizing a strong first recruit
ing class, Teevens also worked
to hire the rest of his coaching
staff. Just yesterday, the team
announced that Tom
Williams, a former star line
backer for the Cardinal, who

graduated with bachelor's and
master's degrees from Stan
ford, will be named the co-de
fensive coordinator and Line
backers coach. Also, Tom
Qninn, who last worked at San
Jose State, will be the Cardi
nal's special teams coordinator
and tight-ends coach.
A native of New England who
starred at Dartmouth before
later coaching the Big Green to
Ivy League success, Teevens
stressed his happiness with
working at an institution that
featured the best in both acade

New football head coach Buddy Teevens spoke to The Daily last week
about football, family and all that falls in between. He said he was
happy that Stanford stressed both academics and athletics.
mics and athletics. Teevens also
spoke extensively about the type of
wide-open, attacking team he'd
like to create on the Farm.
Finally, Teevens emphasized
his desire to connect with the cam
pus community and the under
graduate student population,
specifically, by speaking at dorms
and houses around campus.
The first part of an edited
transcript of the conversation
follows. Look in the Sports sec
tion of tomorrow's Daily for the
rest of the interview.
Daily: How have the past few
weeks been?
Teevens: Hectic. Enjoyable.
Very exciting obviously, with all
the change.
The recruiting process was the
No. 1 focus coming in. It seemed
to go fairly well. We're very
pleased with the initial recruiting
class. I think it's very telling the
impact that Stanford University
has on people around the coun
try. It was like we didn't skip a
beat in recruiting.
A lot of people on the road
wanted to know what the staff will
look like. I have spent a lot of the
time being very deliberate in eval
uating the guys that I was speaking
with. I did a lot of background re
search and so forth. I was really
looking for people with regional
backgrounds in recruiting, differ
ent sections geographically
around the country, people who
by education or by work experi
ence had been in an academic en
vironment, so they understood
that Stanford is a little bit different
than some of the state schools and
so forth.
Daily: Has your family moved
out yet?
Teevens: The school was
kind enough to have them out
for the press conference and

then they went back. My little
boy did not want to leave. He
was kicking and screaming all
the way to the airport.
One's a sophomore, 15, my lit
tle girl. She's a volleyball player.
She was really excited to come
out to California where Stanford
volleyball is such a successful
program and to live in a state
where volleyball is held in pretty
high regard.
And my son is a surfer. He
knew all about Maverick's and
that type of thing. Hopefully we
can keep him out of there. I
didn't tell him about the water
temperature, though.
They're excited and my wife is
as well.
Daily: How different are the
elements that you sell the re
cruits on about Stanford than
they were for Florida? Or for
Dartmouth?
Teevens: The interesting thing
is, when I walk into schools, peo
ple will meet me and bring me
down to the guidance office and
the principal's office. And that
rarely, if ever, happened at some
other schools.
I think there's such tremen
dous universal respect for Stan
ford's education, the Stanford de
gree and the academic environ
ment. And then to have an oppor
tunity to talk about one of the top
conferences in the country, the
success that Stanford has had in
football, that's a unique combina
tion. There's really not another
school in the country that can pre
sent those two.
So, generally, the ones that we
do talk to value education appre
ciably higher than some of the
guys who want to major in NFL.
Having said that, we also talk
to guys who we hope that their ul
timate goal in the sport is to com
pete in the National Football
League. Across the board, ex
celling is kind of a tradition here,
not an exception.
Daily: You've talked about im

porting Steve Spurrier's Fun-'n'-
Gun Florida offense. Especially
on the offensive side of the ball,
did you see recruits' faces light
up when you talked about that?
Teevens: I think it's impor
tant to have an identity program
matically. Historically Stanford
has had some great passing
teams, coaches, quarterbacks
[and] receivers. And, I felt, if you
present a passing opportunity to
people nationwide, it's an attrac
tion to quarterbacks and re
ceivers, offensive linemen —
they know they have to learn
pass-protective skills to pursue
NFL opportunities — and for
running backs. It's a pro-style
approach and that's something
that's attractive to them.
You flip it on the other side of
the ball, too. The top-paid guys in
the league are pass-rushers. So, we
talk to down linemen and say
you're working against the best
pass-protectors around. And, with
linebackers, it's all about the at
tacking mindset defensively. Sec
ondary players, when you talk
pass-game, it's one-on-one cover
age, and at the next level they want
cover corners. So you have a
chance to work your skills in a
passing environment for the next
four or five years.
Across the board, there's an at
traction to wide-open offense and
a pressure-type defense.
Daily: Does that help get coaches,
too? Mike Sanford, your new of
fensive coordinator, said he
thought Stanford's offense could
be a cross between Florida and
the St. Louis Rams.
Teevens: I think it certainly
helps. [Sanford's] background
with Norv Turner, one of the
strongest passing minds in the
N FL, and with Steve Spurrier now
taking it to the NFL, it's kind of a
merging of ideas there. So, it's ex
citing sitting in and talking about
different aspects and molding an
offense that is going to be fun to
play in, exciting to watch and pro
ductive as well.

not an exception.
Daily: You've talked about im

porting Steve Spurrier's Fun-'n'-
Gun Florida offense. Especially
on the offensive side of the ball,
did you see recruits' faces light
up when you talked about that?
Teevens: I think it's impor
tant to have an identity program
matically. Historically Stanford
has had some great passing
teams, coaches, quarterbacks
[and] receivers. And, I felt, if you
present a passing opportunity to
people nationwide, it's an attrac
tion to quarterbacks and re
ceivers, offensive linemen —
they know they have to learn
pass-protective skills to pursue
NFL opportunities — and for
running backs. It's a pro-style
approach and that's something
that's attractive to them.
You flip it on the other side of
the ball, too. The top-paid guys in
the league are pass-rushers. So, we
talk to down linemen and say
you're working against the best
pass-protectors around. And, with
linebackers, it's all about the at
tacking mindset defensively. Sec
ondary players, when you talk
pass-game, it's one-on-one cover
age, and at the next level they want
cover corners. So you have a
chance to work your skills in a
passing environment for the next
four or five years.
Across the board, there's an at
traction to wide-open offense and
a pressure-type defense.
Daily: Does that help get coaches,
too? Mike Sanford, your new of
fensive coordinator, said he
thought Stanford's offense could
be a cross between Florida and
the St. Louis Rams.
Teevens: I think it certainly
helps. [Sanford's] background
with Norv Turner, one of the
strongest passing minds in the
N FL, and with Steve Spurrier now
taking it to the NFL, it's kind of a
merging of ideas there. So, it's ex
citing sitting in and talking about
different aspects and molding an
offense that is going to be fun to
play in, exciting to watch and pro
ductive as well.
Last week. The Daily sat
down fora discussion with the
Cardinal's smiling, enthusias
tic new head football coach,
Buddy Teevens.
While he spent much of his
time on the road last month fi
nalizing a strong first recruit
ing class, Teevens also worked
to hire the rest of his coaching
staff. Just yesterday, the team
announced that Tom
Williams, a former star line
backer for the Cardinal, who

graduated with bachelor's and
master's degrees from Stan
ford, will be named the co-de
fensive coordinator and Line
backers coach. Also, Tom
Qninn, who last worked at San
Jose State, will be the Cardi
nal's special teams coordinator
and tight-ends coach.
A native of New England who
starred at Dartmouth before
later coaching the Big Green to
Ivy League success, Teevens
stressed his happiness with
working at an institution that
featured the best in both acade

New football head coach Buddy Teevens spoke to The Daily last week
about football, family and all that falls in between. He said he was
happy that Stanford stressed both academics and athletics.
mics and athletics. Teevens also
spoke extensively about the type of
wide-open, attacking team he'd
like to create on the Farm.
Finally, Teevens emphasized
his desire to connect with the cam
pus community and the under
graduate student population,
specifically, by speaking at dorms
and houses around campus.
The first part of an edited
transcript of the conversation
follows. Look in the Sports sec
tion of tomorrow's Daily for the
rest of the interview.
Daily: How have the past few
weeks been?
Teevens: Hectic. Enjoyable.
Very exciting obviously, with all
the change.
The recruiting process was the
No. 1 focus coming in. It seemed
to go fairly well. We're very
pleased with the initial recruiting
class. I think it's very telling the
impact that Stanford University
has on people around the coun
try. It was like we didn't skip a
beat in recruiting.
A lot of people on the road
wanted to know what the staff will
look like. I have spent a lot of the
time being very deliberate in eval
uating the guys that I was speaking
with. I did a lot of background re
search and so forth. I was really
looking for people with regional
backgrounds in recruiting, differ
ent sections geographically
around the country, people who
by education or by work experi
ence had been in an academic en
vironment, so they understood
that Stanford is a little bit different
than some of the state schools and
so forth.
Daily: Has your family moved
out yet?
Teevens: The school was
kind enough to have them out
for the press conference and

then they went back. My little
boy did not want to leave. He
was kicking and screaming all
the way to the airport.
One's a sophomore, 15, my lit
tle girl. She's a volleyball player.
She was really excited to come
out to California where Stanford
volleyball is such a successful
program and to live in a state
where volleyball is held in pretty
high regard.
And my son is a surfer. He
knew all about Maverick's and
that type of thing. Hopefully we
can keep him out of there. I
didn't tell him about the water
temperature, though.
They're excited and my wife is
as well.
Daily: How different are the
elements that you sell the re
cruits on about Stanford than
they were for Florida? Or for
Dartmouth?
Teevens: The interesting thing
is, when I walk into schools, peo
ple will meet me and bring me
down to the guidance office and
the principal's office. And that
rarely, if ever, happened at some
other schools.
I think there's such tremen
dous universal respect for Stan
ford's education, the Stanford de
gree and the academic environ
ment. And then to have an oppor
tunity to talk about one of the top
conferences in the country, the
success that Stanford has had in
football, that's a unique combina
tion. There's really not another
school in the country that can pre
sent those two.
So, generally, the ones that we
do talk to value education appre
ciably higher than some of the
guys who want to major in NFL.
Having said that, we also talk
to guys who we hope that their ul
timate goal in the sport is to com
pete in the National Football
League. Across the board, ex
celling is kind of a tradition here,
not an exception.
