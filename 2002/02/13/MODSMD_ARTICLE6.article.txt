### CYNTHIA H. CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
After a year of planning, the
Stanford Irvine Institute for Diver
sity in the Arts launched its first
program at the beginning of win
ter quarter.
"Cartographies of Race: Map
ping Race and Space in California"
is intended to open communica
tion between artists-in-residence
and students on issues of diversity.
The artists working with stu
dents are Aya de Leon, spoken
word poet and youth worker; Bren
da Wong Aoki, writer and per
former; Mark Izu, composer and
musician; and Mildred Howard,
mixed media and installation artist.
In each class, students address
the issue of race in California by
producing works of art based on
personal experiences. In de
Leon's spoken word workshop,
students receive poetry and prose

writing instruction that empha
sizes the spoken word perfor
mance, for example.
The program also features
noontime lectures with artists.
"[ The lectures] feature the four
artists-in-residence as well as cam
pus and guest speakers to expand
student exposure to artists who are
doing work that deals with ethnici
ty and diversity," said Georgina
Hernandez, associate director of
the institute.
Last Thursday, David Henry
Hwang, a Tony Award-winning
playwright and Stanford alumnus,
was the guest lecturer. According
to Assoc. Drama Professor Harry
Elam, Hwan£ was brought to cam
pus because his latest play —open-
ing on Broadway in the Fall and ti
tled, "Flower Drum Song"— ad
dresses issues of immigration and
American identity. According to
program coordinators, these are
issues that deal with mapping race

and space.
Hwang, who describes Stan
ford as a place where he discov
ered himself not only as a play
wright but also as an Asian Amer
ican, said he enjoys coming back
to campus regularly. In accepting
his most recent invitation, Hwang
said he was particularly interested
in the institute because it investi
gates many of the same issues that
he finds in his own work.
"It seems to me a very impor
tant initiative, as it spearheads in
vestigation into some of the issues
affecting arts and culture in Amer
ica and the world today," he said.
"As a Stanford student, I reached
a point where I was interested in
learning more about these very is
sues, but there were few resources
on campus in my day to assist and
support my investigation."
There was a reception for
Hwang on Wednesday night at the
Faculty Club, during which mem

bers of the Asian-American The
ater Project performed excerpts
from several of Hwang's plays.
Richard J. Yuen, assistant dean
of students and director of the
Asian American Activities Center,
played an important role in bring
ing Hwang to Stanford. The cen
ter co-sponsored 11wang's visit,
obtaining additional funding
from the President's Office and
the Dean of Students' Office.
Yuen also introduced Elam to
Aoki and Izu, two of the four
artist s-in-residence.
"I believe it's important for stu
dents and faculty to experience the
issues of all diverse people in
America and how culture, ethnici
ty and race permeate every facet of
our lives," said Yuen.
Hernandez agreed.
"Census data of racial groups
tend to only provide the starkest
measures of diversity, rather than
the true life stories about what di
versity means for our region and

the people in it," she said.
The idea for the institute origi
nated from the late Prof. Charles
Lyons, the Margery Bailey Profes
sor of English and Dramatic Liter
ature, who died in 1999. The or
ganization is funded by the James
Irvine Foundation.
