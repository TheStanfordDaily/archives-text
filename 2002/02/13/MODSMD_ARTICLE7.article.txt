field. The deadline for submissions is Feb. 22.
Asa professional publication, it will "provide
a forum for undergraduates to showcase their
research," said freshman Alex Bradford, the
executive editor of the journal. "We want gen

few pages of' Nature' or 'Scientific American,'
not technical articles."
Bradford said he plans to publish 10 to 15 ar

can evolve into something published quarterly.
Papers are judged by a panel of students and
those accepted will receive recognition. I lowev
er, no monetary award will be given.

"The [journal] encourages undergraduate
research by publishing the best papers in the
areas of the natural sciences, engineering, the
social sciences and the humanities," said sopho
more Jonathan Olsen, the journal's managing
editor. "We hope undergraduates will be excit
ed by the opportunity lo be published and re
viewed by theii peers.
"The process should provide valuable cri
tique for writers as well as recognition for their
insightful work."
Many faculty members and students have al-
ready given positive feedback to
the idea of a journal. Some faculty
members have also recommended

papers that they have found note
worthy, according to Bradford.
"There is a lot of high-caliber
undergraduate research here that
is of interest to the rest of the stu
dent body and is waiting to be rec
ognized," Olsen said.
The journal is also working in

conjunction with the Campaign
for Undergraduate Education.
"We hope to raise an endow
ment this year in order to pub
lish the journal quarterly and
offer [a] monetary reward [to
contributors]," Bradford said.
"This will definitely happen in

the future."
Articles should be one to 10
pages in length, double-spaced, in
