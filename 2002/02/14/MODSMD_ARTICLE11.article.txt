# Scandal hits skating judges

### 
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — An
Olympic referee raised questions
about the scores that narrowly gave
the gold medal to the Russians in
pairs figure skating, the head of the
skating union said yesterday.
It was the latest development in
what has quickly become the biggest
story of the Winter Games.
Ottavio Cinquanta, International
Skating Union president, said he had
received "certain allegations" from
American referee Ronald Pfenning,
who oversaw the nine judges who
scored the competition. Pfenning
could have been relaying a complaint
from himself or any of the judges.
ISU rules prevent Pfenning or any
one else on the judging panel from
talking publicly about decisions.
Cinquanta did not provide details
of the allegations. Others also had
questioned the results, "but the most
important is the one of the referee,"
he said.
"He is the coordinator of the
competition."

Cinquanta also said he was embar
rassed by the furor over the Russians
winning despite an obvious technical
error. Canada's Olympic delegation
has demanded an investigation, and
the union said it would conduct a rare
"internal assessment."
That assessment could lead to revi
sions in judging, Cinquanta said.
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze won the gold medal by
the tiniest margin over Canada's
Jamie Sale and David Pelletier on
Monday night. They won a 5-4 split
even though Sikharulidze stepped
out of a double axel.
The Canadians got only four 5.9s
for artistry compared with seven 5.9s
for the Russians. Boos rained down as
the marks flashed.
Cinquanta announced that the ex
ecutive council of the federation would
meet on Feb. 18 to discuss judging and
consider any revisions to the rules.
However, he reiterated that the com
petition was over, meaning the Rus
sians would keej) their gold medal.
