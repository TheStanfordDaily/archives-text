### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The MIT-Stanford Venture Laborato
ry presented a panel titled, "How Secure
is Your Fingerprint," at the Graduate
School of Business 011 Jan. 22. The event
emphasized the urgency to implement
recently-developed technology in bio
metrics and security. An ticipants includ
ed leaders in the field, representing sev
eral companies.
1 he fouiim provided an opportuni
ty to discuss identity-related security
issues. Speakers explained that bio
metrics and identity technologies are
more a concern than ever in the Unit
ed States after Sept. 11. They said
they consider techniques such as bio
metric scanning of facial features, fin
gerprint security and national identi
fication cards to be crucial in protect
ing U.S. citizens.
"In today's world, we know we have to
manage identity better, so that an unau
thorized person cannot gain access to the
information that we have," said Bob Mc-
Cashin, chairman and chief executive of
ficer of the Identix Corp. "At Identix,

we've known this for years, but the events
of [Sept. 11] have made it clear to the
world at large. I think ... many cases will
be multiple authentication â€” you may
need a fingerprint and an iris, or a finger
print and a pin [to access a system]."
The audience at the event included
Stanford students and local executives,
as well as visitors from other parts of
California.
"We came from L.A.," said Stephen
Gomes of AuthentiKey. " This is right in
our field, so we wanted to come up here
and hear the latest word from Silicon Val
ley. We're creating the first identity man
agement service provider."
" I think it's a great opportunity to meet
people with interesting ideas and experi
ence," AuthentiKey CEO Brian Yoder
said. "There were people 112 rom all differ
ent technology areas in authentication
and security."
The Laboratory was founded by the
MIT Enterprise Forum, the Stanford Of
fice of Technology Licensing and the
Graduate School of Business Alumni As
sociation. It is a volunteer-run and non
profit organization.
"We're part of the MIT Enterprise

Forum, of which there are 21 chapters
across the country," said Michael Feld
man, sponsorship chair of the Laborato
ry. "This chapter is one of a few in part
nership with another school."
The Laboratory will host a panel titled,
"Nanoelectronics: The Quantum Leap
from Theory to Practice," Tuesday at the
Business School. Registration for the event
