## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU, SLAC behavior harms student causes 
### 
Published Since 1891

The actions of the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition and the ASSU at
the University President Hen
nessy-ASSU question-and-answer
session undermined University and student
efforts to create increased student input in
administrative desicions. While many mem
bers of the Senate have disavowed knowl
edge of the coalition's intentions at the meet
ing, the group must accept responsibility for
the deterioration of a productive dialogue to
a scathing protest.
When inviting Hennessy to the annual
meeting, the ASSU informed him that it had
12 questions to be delivered by undergradu
ate senators and members of the Graduate
Student Council. This agreed-upon format
was followed for the first 11 questions, and
audience members were allowed to ask fol
low-up questions. This process proceeded in
a respectful and professional manner until
the 12th question, when ASSU President

Matt Brewer specifically referred a question
to the coalition. Immediately approximately
45 black-clad students confrontationally
jumped to their feet and began firing de
mands at Hennessy, complete with placards
iterating their positions.
Politics aside, we condemn the actions of
the ASSU and the coalition concerning the
meeting. The underlying goal of the coali
tion's presence was to persuade Hennessy to
meet with students and workers in regards to
his decision to adopt a living wage for Uni
versity workers. But the coalition chose to
make a spectacle of itself instead of working
toward its goal constructively. Hennessy's
adoption of the living wage policy demon
strated a willingness to listen to student
groups and take action, but by its inappro
priate behavior, the coalition provided Hen
nessy and the University with countless rea
sons to avoid student-initiated meetings. The
coalition and ASSU actions are a strong ar

gument against the very thing they are fight
ing for: increased student input.
Hennessy, and admittedly many ASSU of
ficials, were shocked by this protest. To Hen
nessy and other administrative staff it ap
peared that Brewer and the entire ASSU,
many of whom also wore black, had invited
him into a firing squad. The coalition igno
rantly demanded that Hennessy meet its de
mands on the spot, and the discussion
evolved into a debate, with many in the coali
tion affording Hennessy little respect in word
or tone.
The ASSU had a responsibility to keep the
meeting under control and abide by the
guidelines it gave to Hennessy. This organiza
tion, which supposedly represents all Stanford
students, should never take action that will in
tentionally alienate students from University
administration. The ASSU should be in con
stant contact with the University and, accord
ing to Assoc. Dean of Students Morris Graves,

by handling this meeting so poorly it has jeop
ardized its chances for increased input.
The coalition has a responsibility to main
tain a working relationship with the Univer
sity so that it can further influence adminis
trative policy toward University workers.
When the group disrespected Hennessy and
walked out of the meeting chanting with
signs held high, it may have walked out of the
graces of the man that has shown a willing
ness to advance its causes.
We are pleased that the ASSU has apolo
gized to Hennessy. We hope that Tuesday's
debacle will not reflect poorly on the many
organizations the ASSU supports. The
coalition should also apologize to Hennessy
to ensure that its actions are not a detriment
to the workers it supports, and should also
apologize to other student groups including
the Graduate Student Council, whose needs
it overshadowed with its flamboyant and ir
responsible behavior.
