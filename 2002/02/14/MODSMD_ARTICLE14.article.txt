# IT'S IN THE HOLE
## GUP deal a double-bogey 
### 
When I get the chance, I love
to play the Stanford Golf
Course. I don't actually get
to worry about breaking 100
out there very much. There's just some
thing about waking up at 6:30 a.m., call
ing, hanging up when 1 hear a busy signal,
repeating that cycle seven times, and then
haggling on the phone with Pro Shop at
tendants who make John Ashcroft sound
understanding that keeps me from mak
ing a tee-time.
Regardless, the idea that such a gem of
a course could be destroyed by the "need"
fora new hiking path saddens me.
Unfortunately, it all goes back to the
General Use Permit that the University
signed with Santa Clara County in 2000.
First, the whole concept of the county

deciding how Stanford
can use its land, which
the University has
owned for over a centu
ry, seems outlandish.
I feel like I'm back in
tiny Falls Church, Va. In
the tony little town near
where I grew up, the vil
lage arborist had the

lone decision-making power over a
homeowner's ability to even prune a tree
in his or her yard.
Still, only now that the GUP is really
threatening to interfere with something
that I care about am I really getting upset.
Only now that the lovely Stanford Golf
Course is in danger do I feel a need to
speak my mind.
As part of its commitment to the GUP,
for which Stanford "received" the right to
develop around two million square feet of
academic space and 3,000 housing units in
the next 10 years, the University is forced
to reconstruct a hiking trail that presently
runs along the western side of campus.
But, right now, the University's main
plan is to run the new trail down Alpine
Road. Unfortunately, that plan's got just a
few roadblocks, the most important being
that these phantom future hikers might
get run over by passing cars.
Personally, I wouldn't mind taking a
brisk hike down the road on a balmy Fri
day evening during Spring Quarter. But,
I'll admit, the post-Zot's traffic might po
tentially be hazardous. Forty ounces don't
exactly promote safe driving.
Regardless, the second option, which
many believe to be eminently more feasi
ble, would run through or interfere with
11 holes on the current course. Especially
if plans go forward to widen Page Mill
Road as it crosses San Francisquito Greek,
right at the fourth tee, things get kind of
dicey for Joe Average Hacker. The entire
layout of the course and even its contin
ued existence could be in jeopardy.
And that's a shame.
Sure, golf is a game of the elite. It's
painfully behind the racial times and it pro
motes the wearing of some of the goofiest
threads I've seen since leg warmers.
But, the Stanford course is marvelous

ly accessible to all at Stanford (students
get on for $20 and only $10 in twilight)
and most of the people on the course look
surprisingly young and diverse fora golf
course, though unsurprisingly preppy.
(Only on a tee box can men still feel mas
culine in saddle shoes.)
The course is also one of the most beau
tiful places on campus and one of the most
wonderful golf courses in the world.
Standing on the 11th tee, with rows of
tree-topped, quintessentially Californian
hills stacked up towards the cloud-capped
Coastal Mountains, I can't help but feel
good. Even after duck-hooking a 3-iron
into the fairway trap, I still have a spring in
my step.
Then I walk down ihe hill to the 12th,
with its distinctive two trees blocking the
middle of the fairway, framing one of the
most difficult par-4s on the West Coast, fol
lowed by a deceptively difficult par-4
where bunkers loom. Then there's the
14th, over the creek, that always plays a
club, maybe two, longer than 1 think. The
15th, where even I can drive the fringe and
think eagle. The long, uphill march on a
beautiful par-5. A nasty par-3 with a devil
ish green. And, finally, I reach the 18t.li,
with views stretching to the tips of the Bay
Area. Oakland never looked so good.
And that's just the back nine.
What's more, you get a sense of histo
ry and tradition. The course has been
around for over 70 years and was the last
designed by noted architect George
Thomas. It's an original and a piece of
beauty. Even though motorized carts
have found their way onto its fairways,
the course still feels like it should be
walked in woolen knickers. And, of
course, Tiger played there.
When I'm on the Stanford course,
there's not a shot when I don't wonder
whether Tiger Woods ever stood in the
exact same position and then, halfway
through my follow-through, whether he
ever hit it any better. Usually the answer is
obvious. Rut, chipping in fora birdie at No.
12 gave me as much delight as anything in
my golfing life. Sure, it only lowered my
eventual score to a 90, but it also meant that
I'd probably matched the Great One.
Most of the population probably
couldn't care less about the course or about
my plight. In a world of unjust SCN tic ket
policies, where more Natty-Ice-drinking
boys and black-pants-wearing girls are in
vading your Row houses, there are only so
many important things to protest.
But, if you have a chance, borrow your
friend's clubs one warm, sunny after
noon. Get over to the Pro Shop about two
hours before sundown and inquire meek
ly about a twilight time fora single. Plunk
down your $10, hit a few balls onto Ju
nipcro Sen a Road from the first tee, and
take a stroll around the course.
You'll be marching with me through
White Plaza in no time.

that I care about am I really getting upset.
Only now that the lovely Stanford Golf
Course is in danger do I feel a need to
speak my mind.
As part of its commitment to the GUP,
for which Stanford "received" the right to
develop around two million square feet of
academic space and 3,000 housing units in
the next 10 years, the University is forced
to reconstruct a hiking trail that presently
runs along the western side of campus.
But, right now, the University's main
plan is to run the new trail down Alpine
Road. Unfortunately, that plan's got just a
few roadblocks, the most important being
that these phantom future hikers might
get run over by passing cars.
Personally, I wouldn't mind taking a
brisk hike down the road on a balmy Fri
day evening during Spring Quarter. But,
I'll admit, the post-Zot's traffic might po
tentially be hazardous. Forty ounces don't
exactly promote safe driving.
Regardless, the second option, which
many believe to be eminently more feasi
ble, would run through or interfere with
11 holes on the current course. Especially
if plans go forward to widen Page Mill
Road as it crosses San Francisquito Greek,
right at the fourth tee, things get kind of
dicey for Joe Average Hacker. The entire
layout of the course and even its contin
ued existence could be in jeopardy.
And that's a shame.
Sure, golf is a game of the elite. It's
painfully behind the racial times and it pro
motes the wearing of some of the goofiest
threads I've seen since leg warmers.
But, the Stanford course is marvelous

ly accessible to all at Stanford (students
get on for $20 and only $10 in twilight)
and most of the people on the course look
surprisingly young and diverse fora golf
course, though unsurprisingly preppy.
(Only on a tee box can men still feel mas
culine in saddle shoes.)
The course is also one of the most beau
tiful places on campus and one of the most
wonderful golf courses in the world.
Standing on the 11th tee, with rows of
tree-topped, quintessentially Californian
hills stacked up towards the cloud-capped
Coastal Mountains, I can't help but feel
good. Even after duck-hooking a 3-iron
into the fairway trap, I still have a spring in
my step.
Then I walk down ihe hill to the 12th,
with its distinctive two trees blocking the
middle of the fairway, framing one of the
most difficult par-4s on the West Coast, fol
lowed by a deceptively difficult par-4
where bunkers loom. Then there's the
14th, over the creek, that always plays a
club, maybe two, longer than 1 think. The
15th, where even I can drive the fringe and
think eagle. The long, uphill march on a
beautiful par-5. A nasty par-3 with a devil
ish green. And, finally, I reach the 18t.li,
with views stretching to the tips of the Bay
Area. Oakland never looked so good.
And that's just the back nine.
What's more, you get a sense of histo
ry and tradition. The course has been
around for over 70 years and was the last
designed by noted architect George
Thomas. It's an original and a piece of
beauty. Even though motorized carts
have found their way onto its fairways,
the course still feels like it should be
walked in woolen knickers. And, of
course, Tiger played there.
When I'm on the Stanford course,
there's not a shot when I don't wonder
whether Tiger Woods ever stood in the
exact same position and then, halfway
through my follow-through, whether he
ever hit it any better. Usually the answer is
obvious. Rut, chipping in fora birdie at No.
12 gave me as much delight as anything in
my golfing life. Sure, it only lowered my
eventual score to a 90, but it also meant that
I'd probably matched the Great One.
Most of the population probably
couldn't care less about the course or about
my plight. In a world of unjust SCN tic ket
policies, where more Natty-Ice-drinking
boys and black-pants-wearing girls are in
vading your Row houses, there are only so
many important things to protest.
But, if you have a chance, borrow your
friend's clubs one warm, sunny after
noon. Get over to the Pro Shop about two
hours before sundown and inquire meek
ly about a twilight time fora single. Plunk
down your $10, hit a few balls onto Ju
nipcro Sen a Road from the first tee, and
take a stroll around the course.
You'll be marching with me through
White Plaza in no time.

When I get the chance, I love
to play the Stanford Golf
Course. I don't actually get
to worry about breaking 100
out there very much. There's just some
thing about waking up at 6:30 a.m., call
ing, hanging up when 1 hear a busy signal,
repeating that cycle seven times, and then
haggling on the phone with Pro Shop at
tendants who make John Ashcroft sound
understanding that keeps me from mak
ing a tee-time.
Regardless, the idea that such a gem of
a course could be destroyed by the "need"
fora new hiking path saddens me.
Unfortunately, it all goes back to the
General Use Permit that the University
signed with Santa Clara County in 2000.
First, the whole concept of the county

deciding how Stanford
can use its land, which
the University has
owned for over a centu
ry, seems outlandish.
I feel like I'm back in
tiny Falls Church, Va. In
the tony little town near
where I grew up, the vil
lage arborist had the

lone decision-making power over a
homeowner's ability to even prune a tree
in his or her yard.
Still, only now that the GUP is really
threatening to interfere with something
that I care about am I really getting upset.
