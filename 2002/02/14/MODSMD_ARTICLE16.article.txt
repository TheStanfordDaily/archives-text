ASSU officers apologize for 'failing to
moderate' meeting with Hennessy
On Feb. 12, University President John
Hennessy continued the annual tradition
of meeting with the ASSU legislative bod
ies (Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council). The purpose of this
meeting was to address various student
issues including health care, student
space, faculty diversity, housing, and in
terdisciplinary programs. Prior to the
meeting, twelve questions were submit
ted to President Hennessy, six on behalf
of each legislative body.
One particular question posed by an
undergraduate senator, regarding living
wage, coincided with the interests of stu
dents from the Coalition for Labor Justice.
In good faith, the ASSU President and
Vice President, in addition to a few under
graduate senators, made the decision to
defer the senate question regarding living
wage to members of the coalition, who
have been engaged in ongoing discussions
with administration regarding the issue.
Phis slight change of format (deferring
the question) occurred without the
knowledge of many elected officials, in
cluding Graduate Student Council mem
bers, and was intended to pose an impor
tant issue in the spirit of civility. Despite
this intent, the effects undermined stu
dent-administration relationships that we
have worked hard to develop.
Students from the Coalition for Labor
Justice exhibited disrespectful tones and
confrontational manners towards Hen
nessy. The ASSU held no intentions to
place 1 lennessy in a compromising situa
tion. We inadvertently allowed the meet
ing, designated with a specific purpose, to
stray from its mission.
()n behalf of the ASSU, we would like to
issue a formal apology for failing to mod

erate a meeting with deserved civil ex
change. We recognize the importance of
the issue and the value of Hennessy's will
ingness to listen. However, we strongly
disagree with the methods employed by
the Coalition for Labor Justice.
The behavior and attitudes demon
strated by these students in Tuesday's
meeting are not indicative of the relation
ship the ASSU seeks to maintain and de
velop with the University administration.

Seriate Chairperson responds
to SLAC's behavior
SLAC's presentation during Tuesday
night's annual meeting between Univer
sity President John Hennessy and mem
bers of the Undergraduate Senate, the
Graduate Student Council and the Pres
ident and Vice President of the ASSU
had three consequences:
First, by taking advantage of an ASSU
question-and-answer forum to shout slo
gans, demands and objections at I lcn
nessy, participating SLAC members have
jeopardized the relationship between the
ASSU and the administration.

Second, since the ASSU, and specifically
die Undergraduate Senate serves student
groups (including SLAC) as a means of ac
cess to this University's administrators,
members ofSLAG have therefore placed at
great risk the relationship between the stu
dent body and the administration.
Third, the question allotted to SLAC
was only one issue of 12 Hennessy intend
ed to address. By turning the question
and-answer session into an uncivil debate,
SLAC-'s presentation overshadowed nu
merous undergraduate concerns such as
the cancellation of the lAS program and a
perceived lack of socioeconomic diversity
in the admissions process, as well as vital
graduate concerns relating to health / de
pendent care and housing.
The Undergraduate Senate — as well
as numerous individual Senators — have
worked closely with SLAC this year on its
living wage campaign, have participated
in rallies and as Senators have represented
SLAC to the administration.
On Tuesday night, SLAC completely
undermined the Senate's efforts by taking
advantage of an opportunity to address
Hennessy with a question, and instead
using that time to disrespectfully confront
him with a list of accusations and demands.
As a facilitator, I was caught off guard,
since neither I nor any other representa
tive of the Undergraduate Senate were
aware of (he extent to which SLAC in
tended to act. Though I do not write this
on behalf of the Undergraduate Senate, as
its chair 1 consider the Senate to have been
humiliated and thoroughly embarrassed
by SIAC's behavior.
Do not mistake this as a criticism of
SLAC's work. This is not about issues. In
fact, the Senate has taken an officially
proactive and overwhelmingly supportive
role with respect to SLAC and the issues its
members represent.
However, the manner in which mem
bers of SLAC presented themselves on
Tuesday night detracted not only from
their own cause, but has potentially hurt
other groups' access to the administration
independently and via the ASSU.

Zide responds to Mcßride letter
I am writing to address points made in
Stephan Mcßride's interesting, though
borderline-libelous, response to my letter.
First, Mcßride describes my letter as "a
cloaked attempt to undermine the demo
cratic freedoms he stands to defend," hut
oilers no evidence to support this claim.
I can only assume that he makes this
statement because I disagree with the re
sults of a relatively democratic selection
process. 1 112 this is his contention, then it dis
plays a clear misunderstanding of the
principles behind democratic freedom:
the ability of a minority to disagree with a
majority opinion is one of the essen
tial of our freedoms.
I readily acknowledge that I disagree
with the Bush administration's politics
and actions — both overseas and at
home — but I did not, as Mcßride claims,
"impugn Rice's character."
I consider her an intelligent and articu
late woman. Instead, 1 call into question
the morality of our nation's behavior in
Afghanistan. Sunday's issue of The New
York Times details, for example, the Jan.
24 raid on the town of Oruzgan, in which
innocent civilians were killed on suspi
cions raised by unconfirmed intelligence
reports from questionable sources.
Tragically, this is just one of many such
instances, and the government has re
fused to be held accountable for any of

these "collateral damages," as they eu
phemistically refer to slaughtered inno
cents. Further, Bush is now attempting to
use his political popularity to begin simi
lar, misguided hostile action against the
so-called "Axis of Evil."
At home, the U.S.A. Patriot Act takes
away valuable freedoms and creates an at
mosphere conducive to what has been
widely described as the new McCarthyism
which has begun in recent months.
Mcßride describes universities as "cen
ters of free thought in the pursuit of excel
lence," but denies the validity of thought
which dissents from the majority opinion.
I agree that forming a non-disruptive
protest is divisive; those who share my po
litical views are a minority, hut in a free so
ciety, the minority has a right — and an
obligation — to make itself heard.
Inviting Rice to speak at our com
mencement politicizes the event, and I can
not in good conscience allow the Bush ad
ministation's political views to remain un
challenged simply because, "a substantial
majority of the citizenry of this country
support their president." The true patriots
in this country have always been those who
questioned the behavior of the govern
ment rather than those who blindly accept
it in the name of security: As Benjamin
Franklin wrote, "They that can give up es
sential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
To clarify my position, I intend to po
litely and attentively listen to what Rice has
to say because I feel free speech works best
in a respectful dialogue. However, making
it clear that there is a substantial dissenting
minority (again, without disturbing or
"ruining" graduation) is the essence of
"democratic freedoms" and "free thought
in pursuit of excellence."

Mcßride 'wrongfully and viciously'
attacked Zide
With his letter to the Daily, Stephan
Mcßride adds himself to those who try to

silence any opinion that is different than
theirs. Not only did he wrongfully and vi
ciously attack Josh Zide on his democratic
beliefs, but he also distorted some of the
statements made in Zide's letter.
Nowhere in Zide's manuscript did I see
any insulting comment regarding Rice.
The killing of Afghan citizens is a fact,
whether we believe that it is light or
wrong. And the point made by Zide, at
least as 1 understand it, is that by inviting
Rice — who currently has a major impact
on the U.S. anti-terrorist actions — to de
liver a commencement speech in which no
other voices will be heard, Stanford risks
taking sides in a very important, and in my
opinion controversial, issue, in the case
that Rice chooses to give a political speech.
In case it is not obvious by now, I
would like to specify that what 1 find an
noying in Mcßride's letter is not his sup
port of Rice, since 1 respect his opinion,
but his claiming to be defending demo
cratic: freedom against the "cloaked at
tempt" of Zide.
To me, judging from his manuscript,
he sounds more like the person that he ac
cuses Mr. Zide to be. Democratic freedom
is undermined by not letting opposition be
heard, by treating the people who dare to
express different opinions — or even to
offer some constructive criticism —as
"less patriotic" or traitors, by oversimplify
ing a complicated war with many causes
and implications to the battle of the good
versus t he evil, by justifying the war not on
the grounds of punishing those that are
responsible for the attacks but on reaf
firming the "less-than-submissive" nature
of the government.
Those that question the current U.S.
actions are in no way supporters of Osama
bin Laden. They are doing so because they
ask themselves if there is a way that the ter
rorists that caused so much grief to the
American people and thousands of fami
lies be punished without having to cause
the same grief to the families of thousands
of innocent Afghans who have fewer ties
with Osama bin Laden and the dictator
ships that have nurtured him than some of
the previous U.S. administrations.

Those who question believe that there
should be a more open discussion on what
the U.S. reaction should be, hoping that
the collateral damage can be reduced.
They fear that ac tions that are not careful
ly planned may ignite a series of more
catastrophic events that could eventually
backfire on the American nation.
Of course, nobody is obliged to agree
with these views, and history will prove
which side is right. But 1 think that if we
are to defend democracy, these opinions
should be treated with respect and be con
fronted with arguments and not with un
justified attacks on people's patriotism and
democratic beliefs.
As for Mcßride's argument on the sup
port of the majority, I would like to re
mind him just a few of the many times in
American history that the obvious was
eventually proven to be wrong: the mas
sacre of the American Indians, slavery and
abolitionism, women's rights, Jim Crow,
McCarthyism.

Choice of Rice is appropriate
As the Feb. 11 letter by Josh Zide and a
spate of all-campus mailings have demon
strated, there is a significant minority of
students who believe that Condoleezza
Rice is an inappropriate choice fora grad
uation speaker.
That is especially sad since we believe
that Stanford has rarely had so distin
guished a member of its own community
come back to speak at graduation. Rice is
a part of Stanford — she came here over
20 years ago as a fellow in a disarmament
program, stayed to become a full profes
sor in the political science department
and most especially served as provost for
six years. She even attained that special
mark of distinction as a Stanford institu
tion by having a whole song at Gaieties
devoted to her last year.
Like her or not, she's one of our own,
and by speaking at Commencement,
she is returning home to the place

where she spent most of the last 20 years
of her life.
We seniors feel that the choice ol Rice
as graduation speaker is appropriate and
that, by her acceptance, the University it
self will gain. Rice was nominated by the
students and approved by the senior class
presidents before she was chosen by the
University administration. She has distin
guished herself in public service, rising to
one of the highest appointed offices in
America. In addition, her presence as a
black woman underscores Stanford's
commitment to a society where achieve
ment is gained based on merit rather
than the color of one's skin.
Unlike several of the speakers from
the last several years, Rice is not only an
esteemed public figure, but a scholar as
well. In short, Rice embodies the quali
ties of which Stanford should be most
proud: equality, merit, public service,
and scholarship.
Finally, although we applaud Josh
Zide's call fora non-disruptive protest
over walk-outs or picketing, we feel that
protesting Rice in her own home is rude
to her and detrimental to Stanford's
image ai large.
She was chosen for her prominence,
not her politics; politicizing the event by
protesting is unfair not only to her, but
also the vast majority of students who want
to their graduation to be focused on them
rather than on the war against terrorism.
Let us instead welcome the return of
one of the Stanford community's most dis
tinguished members, and consider her
choice and her speech as a part of the vari
ety of perspectives that the University
should dedicate itself to maintain.

Zide responds to Mcßride letter
I am writing to address points made in
Stephan Mcßride's interesting, though
borderline-libelous, response to my letter.
First, Mcßride describes my letter as "a
cloaked attempt to undermine the demo
cratic freedoms he stands to defend," hut
oilers no evidence to support this claim.
I can only assume that he makes this
statement because I disagree with the re
sults of a relatively democratic selection
process. 1 112 this is his contention, then it dis
plays a clear misunderstanding of the
principles behind democratic freedom:
the ability of a minority to disagree with a
majority opinion is one of the essen
tial of our freedoms.
I readily acknowledge that I disagree
with the Bush administration's politics
and actions — both overseas and at
home — but I did not, as Mcßride claims,
"impugn Rice's character."
I consider her an intelligent and articu
late woman. Instead, 1 call into question
the morality of our nation's behavior in
Afghanistan. Sunday's issue of The New
York Times details, for example, the Jan.
24 raid on the town of Oruzgan, in which
innocent civilians were killed on suspi
cions raised by unconfirmed intelligence
reports from questionable sources.
Tragically, this is just one of many such
instances, and the government has re
fused to be held accountable for any of

these "collateral damages," as they eu
phemistically refer to slaughtered inno
cents. Further, Bush is now attempting to
use his political popularity to begin simi
lar, misguided hostile action against the
so-called "Axis of Evil."
At home, the U.S.A. Patriot Act takes
away valuable freedoms and creates an at
mosphere conducive to what has been
widely described as the new McCarthyism
which has begun in recent months.
Mcßride describes universities as "cen
ters of free thought in the pursuit of excel
lence," but denies the validity of thought
which dissents from the majority opinion.
I agree that forming a non-disruptive
protest is divisive; those who share my po
litical views are a minority, hut in a free so
ciety, the minority has a right — and an
obligation — to make itself heard.
Inviting Rice to speak at our com
mencement politicizes the event, and I can
not in good conscience allow the Bush ad
ministation's political views to remain un
challenged simply because, "a substantial
majority of the citizenry of this country
support their president." The true patriots
in this country have always been those who
questioned the behavior of the govern
ment rather than those who blindly accept
it in the name of security: As Benjamin
Franklin wrote, "They that can give up es
sential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
To clarify my position, I intend to po
litely and attentively listen to what Rice has
to say because I feel free speech works best
in a respectful dialogue. However, making
it clear that there is a substantial dissenting
minority (again, without disturbing or
"ruining" graduation) is the essence of
"democratic freedoms" and "free thought
in pursuit of excellence."

Mcßride 'wrongfully and viciously'
attacked Zide
With his letter to the Daily, Stephan
Mcßride adds himself to those who try to

silence any opinion that is different than
theirs. Not only did he wrongfully and vi
ciously attack Josh Zide on his democratic
beliefs, but he also distorted some of the
statements made in Zide's letter.
Nowhere in Zide's manuscript did I see
any insulting comment regarding Rice.
The killing of Afghan citizens is a fact,
whether we believe that it is light or
wrong. And the point made by Zide, at
least as 1 understand it, is that by inviting
Rice — who currently has a major impact
on the U.S. anti-terrorist actions — to de
liver a commencement speech in which no
other voices will be heard, Stanford risks
taking sides in a very important, and in my
opinion controversial, issue, in the case
that Rice chooses to give a political speech.
In case it is not obvious by now, I
would like to specify that what 1 find an
noying in Mcßride's letter is not his sup
port of Rice, since 1 respect his opinion,
but his claiming to be defending demo
cratic: freedom against the "cloaked at
tempt" of Zide.
To me, judging from his manuscript,
he sounds more like the person that he ac
cuses Mr. Zide to be. Democratic freedom
is undermined by not letting opposition be
heard, by treating the people who dare to
express different opinions — or even to
offer some constructive criticism —as
"less patriotic" or traitors, by oversimplify
ing a complicated war with many causes
and implications to the battle of the good
versus t he evil, by justifying the war not on
the grounds of punishing those that are
responsible for the attacks but on reaf
firming the "less-than-submissive" nature
of the government.
Those that question the current U.S.
actions are in no way supporters of Osama
bin Laden. They are doing so because they
ask themselves if there is a way that the ter
rorists that caused so much grief to the
American people and thousands of fami
lies be punished without having to cause
the same grief to the families of thousands
of innocent Afghans who have fewer ties
with Osama bin Laden and the dictator
ships that have nurtured him than some of
the previous U.S. administrations.

Those who question believe that there
should be a more open discussion on what
the U.S. reaction should be, hoping that
the collateral damage can be reduced.
They fear that ac tions that are not careful
ly planned may ignite a series of more
catastrophic events that could eventually
backfire on the American nation.
Of course, nobody is obliged to agree
with these views, and history will prove
which side is right. But 1 think that if we
are to defend democracy, these opinions
should be treated with respect and be con
fronted with arguments and not with un
justified attacks on people's patriotism and
democratic beliefs.
As for Mcßride's argument on the sup
port of the majority, I would like to re
mind him just a few of the many times in
American history that the obvious was
eventually proven to be wrong: the mas
sacre of the American Indians, slavery and
abolitionism, women's rights, Jim Crow,
McCarthyism.

Choice of Rice is appropriate
As the Feb. 11 letter by Josh Zide and a
spate of all-campus mailings have demon
strated, there is a significant minority of
students who believe that Condoleezza
Rice is an inappropriate choice fora grad
uation speaker.
That is especially sad since we believe
that Stanford has rarely had so distin
guished a member of its own community
come back to speak at graduation. Rice is
a part of Stanford — she came here over
20 years ago as a fellow in a disarmament
program, stayed to become a full profes
sor in the political science department
and most especially served as provost for
six years. She even attained that special
mark of distinction as a Stanford institu
tion by having a whole song at Gaieties
devoted to her last year.
Like her or not, she's one of our own,
and by speaking at Commencement,
she is returning home to the place

where she spent most of the last 20 years
of her life.
We seniors feel that the choice ol Rice
as graduation speaker is appropriate and
that, by her acceptance, the University it
self will gain. Rice was nominated by the
students and approved by the senior class
presidents before she was chosen by the
University administration. She has distin
guished herself in public service, rising to
one of the highest appointed offices in
America. In addition, her presence as a
black woman underscores Stanford's
commitment to a society where achieve
ment is gained based on merit rather
than the color of one's skin.
Unlike several of the speakers from
the last several years, Rice is not only an
esteemed public figure, but a scholar as
well. In short, Rice embodies the quali
ties of which Stanford should be most
proud: equality, merit, public service,
and scholarship.
Finally, although we applaud Josh
Zide's call fora non-disruptive protest
over walk-outs or picketing, we feel that
protesting Rice in her own home is rude
to her and detrimental to Stanford's
image ai large.
She was chosen for her prominence,
not her politics; politicizing the event by
protesting is unfair not only to her, but
also the vast majority of students who want
to their graduation to be focused on them
rather than on the war against terrorism.
Let us instead welcome the return of
one of the Stanford community's most dis
tinguished members, and consider her
choice and her speech as a part of the vari
ety of perspectives that the University
should dedicate itself to maintain.

ASSU officers apologize for 'failing to
moderate' meeting with Hennessy
On Feb. 12, University President John
Hennessy continued the annual tradition
of meeting with the ASSU legislative bod
ies (Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council). The purpose of this
meeting was to address various student
issues including health care, student
space, faculty diversity, housing, and in
terdisciplinary programs. Prior to the
meeting, twelve questions were submit
ted to President Hennessy, six on behalf
of each legislative body.
One particular question posed by an
undergraduate senator, regarding living
wage, coincided with the interests of stu
dents from the Coalition for Labor Justice.
In good faith, the ASSU President and
Vice President, in addition to a few under
graduate senators, made the decision to
defer the senate question regarding living
wage to members of the coalition, who
have been engaged in ongoing discussions
with administration regarding the issue.
Phis slight change of format (deferring
the question) occurred without the
knowledge of many elected officials, in
cluding Graduate Student Council mem
bers, and was intended to pose an impor
tant issue in the spirit of civility. Despite
this intent, the effects undermined stu
dent-administration relationships that we
have worked hard to develop.
Students from the Coalition for Labor
Justice exhibited disrespectful tones and
confrontational manners towards Hen
nessy. The ASSU held no intentions to
place 1 lennessy in a compromising situa
tion. We inadvertently allowed the meet
ing, designated with a specific purpose, to
stray from its mission.
()n behalf of the ASSU, we would like to
issue a formal apology for failing to mod

erate a meeting with deserved civil ex
change. We recognize the importance of
the issue and the value of Hennessy's will
ingness to listen. However, we strongly
disagree with the methods employed by
the Coalition for Labor Justice.
The behavior and attitudes demon
strated by these students in Tuesday's
meeting are not indicative of the relation
ship the ASSU seeks to maintain and de
velop with the University administration.

Seriate Chairperson responds
to SLAC's behavior
SLAC's presentation during Tuesday
night's annual meeting between Univer
sity President John Hennessy and mem
bers of the Undergraduate Senate, the
Graduate Student Council and the Pres
ident and Vice President of the ASSU
had three consequences:
First, by taking advantage of an ASSU
question-and-answer forum to shout slo
gans, demands and objections at I lcn
nessy, participating SLAC members have
jeopardized the relationship between the
ASSU and the administration.

Second, since the ASSU, and specifically
die Undergraduate Senate serves student
groups (including SLAC) as a means of ac
cess to this University's administrators,
members ofSLAG have therefore placed at
great risk the relationship between the stu
dent body and the administration.
Third, the question allotted to SLAC
was only one issue of 12 Hennessy intend
ed to address. By turning the question
and-answer session into an uncivil debate,
SLAC-'s presentation overshadowed nu
merous undergraduate concerns such as
the cancellation of the lAS program and a
perceived lack of socioeconomic diversity
in the admissions process, as well as vital
graduate concerns relating to health / de
pendent care and housing.
The Undergraduate Senate — as well
as numerous individual Senators — have
worked closely with SLAC this year on its
living wage campaign, have participated
in rallies and as Senators have represented
SLAC to the administration.
On Tuesday night, SLAC completely
undermined the Senate's efforts by taking
advantage of an opportunity to address
Hennessy with a question, and instead
using that time to disrespectfully confront
him with a list of accusations and demands.
As a facilitator, I was caught off guard,
since neither I nor any other representa

Mcßride 'wrongfully and viciously'
attacked Zide
With his letter to the Daily, Stephan
Mcßride adds himself to those who try to

silence any opinion that is different than
theirs. Not only did he wrongfully and vi
ciously attack Josh Zide on his democratic
beliefs, but he also distorted some of the
statements made in Zide's letter.
Nowhere in Zide's manuscript did I see
any insulting comment regarding Rice.
The killing of Afghan citizens is a fact,
whether we believe that it is light or
wrong. And the point made by Zide, at
least as 1 understand it, is that by inviting
Rice — who currently has a major impact
on the U.S. anti-terrorist actions — to de
liver a commencement speech in which no
other voices will be heard, Stanford risks
taking sides in a very important, and in my
opinion controversial, issue, in the case
that Rice chooses to give a political speech.
In case it is not obvious by now, I
would like to specify that what 1 find an
noying in Mcßride's letter is not his sup
port of Rice, since 1 respect his opinion,
but his claiming to be defending demo
cratic: freedom against the "cloaked at
tempt" of Zide.
To me, judging from his manuscript,
he sounds more like the person that he ac
cuses Mr. Zide to be. Democratic freedom
is undermined by not letting opposition be
heard, by treating the people who dare to
express different opinions — or even to
offer some constructive criticism —as
"less patriotic" or traitors, by oversimplify
ing a complicated war with many causes
and implications to the battle of the good
versus t he evil, by justifying the war not on
the grounds of punishing those that are
responsible for the attacks but on reaf
firming the "less-than-submissive" nature
of the government.
Those that question the current U.S.
actions are in no way supporters of Osama
bin Laden. They are doing so because they
ask themselves if there is a way that the ter
rorists that caused so much grief to the
American people and thousands of fami
lies be punished without having to cause
the same grief to the families of thousands
of innocent Afghans who have fewer ties
with Osama bin Laden and the dictator
ships that have nurtured him than some of
the previous U.S. administrations.

Those who question believe that there
should be a more open discussion on what
the U.S. reaction should be, hoping that
the collateral damage can be reduced.
They fear that ac tions that are not careful
ly planned may ignite a series of more
catastrophic events that could eventually
backfire on the American nation.
Of course, nobody is obliged to agree
with these views, and history will prove
which side is right. But 1 think that if we
are to defend democracy, these opinions
should be treated with respect and be con
fronted with arguments and not with un
justified attacks on people's patriotism and
democratic beliefs.
As for Mcßride's argument on the sup
port of the majority, I would like to re
mind him just a few of the many times in
American history that the obvious was
eventually proven to be wrong: the mas
sacre of the American Indians, slavery and
abolitionism, women's rights, Jim Crow,
McCarthyism.

Choice of Rice is appropriate
As the Feb. 11 letter by Josh Zide and a
spate of all-campus mailings have demon
strated, there is a significant minority of
students who believe that Condoleezza
Rice is an inappropriate choice fora grad
uation speaker.
That is especially sad since we believe
that Stanford has rarely had so distin
guished a member of its own community
come back to speak at graduation. Rice is
a part of Stanford — she came here over
20 years ago as a fellow in a disarmament
program, stayed to become a full profes
sor in the political science department
and most especially served as provost for
six years. She even attained that special
mark of distinction as a Stanford institu
tion by having a whole song at Gaieties
devoted to her last year.
Like her or not, she's one of our own,
and by speaking at Commencement,
she is returning home to the place

where she spent most of the last 20 years
of her life.
We seniors feel that the choice ol Rice
as graduation speaker is appropriate and
that, by her acceptance, the University it
self will gain. Rice was nominated by the
students and approved by the senior class
presidents before she was chosen by the
University administration. She has distin
guished herself in public service, rising to
one of the highest appointed offices in
America. In addition, her presence as a
black woman underscores Stanford's
commitment to a society where achieve
ment is gained based on merit rather
than the color of one's skin.
Unlike several of the speakers from
the last several years, Rice is not only an
esteemed public figure, but a scholar as
well. In short, Rice embodies the quali
ties of which Stanford should be most
proud: equality, merit, public service,
and scholarship.
Finally, although we applaud Josh
Zide's call fora non-disruptive protest
over walk-outs or picketing, we feel that
protesting Rice in her own home is rude
to her and detrimental to Stanford's
image ai large.
She was chosen for her prominence,
not her politics; politicizing the event by
protesting is unfair not only to her, but
also the vast majority of students who want
to their graduation to be focused on them
rather than on the war against terrorism.
Let us instead welcome the return of
one of the Stanford community's most dis
tinguished members, and consider her
choice and her speech as a part of the vari
ety of perspectives that the University
should dedicate itself to maintain.

ASSU officers apologize for 'failing to
moderate' meeting with Hennessy
On Feb. 12, University President John
Hennessy continued the annual tradition
of meeting with the ASSU legislative bod
ies (Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council). The purpose of this
meeting was to address various student
issues including health care, student
space, faculty diversity, housing, and in
terdisciplinary programs. Prior to the
meeting, twelve questions were submit
ted to President Hennessy, six on behalf
of each legislative body.
One particular question posed by an
undergraduate senator, regarding living
wage, coincided with the interests of stu
dents from the Coalition for Labor Justice.
In good faith, the ASSU President and
Vice President, in addition to a few under
graduate senators, made the decision to
defer the senate question regarding living
wage to members of the coalition, who
have been engaged in ongoing discussions
with administration regarding the issue.
Phis slight change of format (deferring
the question) occurred without the
knowledge of many elected officials, in
cluding Graduate Student Council mem
bers, and was intended to pose an impor
tant issue in the spirit of civility. Despite
this intent, the effects undermined stu
dent-administration relationships that we
have worked hard to develop.
Students from the Coalition for Labor
Justice exhibited disrespectful tones and
confrontational manners towards Hen
nessy. The ASSU held no intentions to
place 1 lennessy in a compromising situa
tion. We inadvertently allowed the meet
ing, designated with a specific purpose, to
stray from its mission.
()n behalf of the ASSU, we would like to
issue a formal apology for failing to mod

erate a meeting with deserved civil ex
change. We recognize the importance of
the issue and the value of Hennessy's will
ingness to listen. However, we strongly
disagree with the methods employed by
the Coalition for Labor Justice.
The behavior and attitudes demon
strated by these students in Tuesday's
meeting are not indicative of the relation
ship the ASSU seeks to maintain and de
velop with the University administration.

Seriate Chairperson responds
to SLAC's behavior
SLAC's presentation during Tuesday
night's annual meeting between Univer
sity President John Hennessy and mem
bers of the Undergraduate Senate, the
Graduate Student Council and the Pres
ident and Vice President of the ASSU
had three consequences:
First, by taking advantage of an ASSU
question-and-answer forum to shout slo
gans, demands and objections at I lcn
nessy, participating SLAC members have
jeopardized the relationship between the
ASSU and the administration.

Second, since the ASSU, and specifically
die Undergraduate Senate serves student
groups (including SLAC) as a means of ac
cess to this University's administrators,
members ofSLAG have therefore placed at
great risk the relationship between the stu
dent body and the administration.
Third, the question allotted to SLAC
was only one issue of 12 Hennessy intend
ed to address. By turning the question
and-answer session into an uncivil debate,
SLAC-'s presentation overshadowed nu
merous undergraduate concerns such as
the cancellation of the lAS program and a
perceived lack of socioeconomic diversity
in the admissions process, as well as vital
graduate concerns relating to health / de
pendent care and housing.
The Undergraduate Senate — as well
as numerous individual Senators — have
worked closely with SLAC this year on its
living wage campaign, have participated
in rallies and as Senators have represented
SLAC to the administration.
On Tuesday night, SLAC completely
undermined the Senate's efforts by taking
advantage of an opportunity to address
Hennessy with a question, and instead
using that time to disrespectfully confront
him with a list of accusations and demands.
As a facilitator, I was caught off guard,
since neither I nor any other representa
tive of the Undergraduate Senate were
aware of (he extent to which SLAC in
tended to act. Though I do not write this
on behalf of the Undergraduate Senate, as
its chair 1 consider the Senate to have been
humiliated and thoroughly embarrassed
by SIAC's behavior.
Do not mistake this as a criticism of
SLAC's work. This is not about issues. In
fact, the Senate has taken an officially
proactive and overwhelmingly supportive
role with respect to SLAC and the issues its
members represent.
However, the manner in which mem
bers of SLAC presented themselves on
Tuesday night detracted not only from
their own cause, but has potentially hurt
other groups' access to the administration
independently and via the ASSU.

Zide responds to Mcßride letter
I am writing to address points made in
Stephan Mcßride's interesting, though
borderline-libelous, response to my letter.
First, Mcßride describes my letter as "a
cloaked attempt to undermine the demo
cratic freedoms he stands to defend," hut
oilers no evidence to support this claim.
I can only assume that he makes this
statement because I disagree with the re
sults of a relatively democratic selection
process. 1 112 this is his contention, then it dis
plays a clear misunderstanding of the
principles behind democratic freedom:
the ability of a minority to disagree with a
majority opinion is one of the essen
tial of our freedoms.
I readily acknowledge that I disagree
with the Bush administration's politics
and actions — both overseas and at
home — but I did not, as Mcßride claims,
"impugn Rice's character."
I consider her an intelligent and articu
late woman. Instead, 1 call into question
the morality of our nation's behavior in
Afghanistan. Sunday's issue of The New
York Times details, for example, the Jan.
24 raid on the town of Oruzgan, in which
innocent civilians were killed on suspi
cions raised by unconfirmed intelligence
reports from questionable sources.
Tragically, this is just one of many such
instances, and the government has re
fused to be held accountable for any of

these "collateral damages," as they eu
phemistically refer to slaughtered inno
cents. Further, Bush is now attempting to
use his political popularity to begin simi
lar, misguided hostile action against the
so-called "Axis of Evil."
At home, the U.S.A. Patriot Act takes
away valuable freedoms and creates an at
mosphere conducive to what has been
widely described as the new McCarthyism
which has begun in recent months.
Mcßride describes universities as "cen
ters of free thought in the pursuit of excel
lence," but denies the validity of thought
which dissents from the majority opinion.
I agree that forming a non-disruptive
protest is divisive; those who share my po
litical views are a minority, hut in a free so
ciety, the minority has a right — and an
obligation — to make itself heard.
Inviting Rice to speak at our com
mencement politicizes the event, and I can
not in good conscience allow the Bush ad
ministation's political views to remain un
challenged simply because, "a substantial
majority of the citizenry of this country
support their president." The true patriots
in this country have always been those who
questioned the behavior of the govern
ment rather than those who blindly accept
it in the name of security: As Benjamin
Franklin wrote, "They that can give up es
sential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
To clarify my position, I intend to po
litely and attentively listen to what Rice has
to say because I feel free speech works best
in a respectful dialogue. However, making
it clear that there is a substantial dissenting
minority (again, without disturbing or
"ruining" graduation) is the essence of
"democratic freedoms" and "free thought
in pursuit of excellence."

six years. She even attained that special
mark of distinction as a Stanford institu
tion by having a whole song at Gaieties
devoted to her last year.
Like her or not, she's one of our own,
and by speaking at Commencement,
she is returning home to the place

where she spent most of the last 20 years
of her life.
We seniors feel that the choice ol Rice
as graduation speaker is appropriate and
that, by her acceptance, the University it
self will gain. Rice was nominated by the
students and approved by the senior class
presidents before she was chosen by the
University administration. She has distin
guished herself in public service, rising to
one of the highest appointed offices in
America. In addition, her presence as a
black woman underscores Stanford's
commitment to a society where achieve
ment is gained based on merit rather
than the color of one's skin.
Unlike several of the speakers from
the last several years, Rice is not only an
esteemed public figure, but a scholar as
well. In short, Rice embodies the quali
ties of which Stanford should be most
proud: equality, merit, public service,
and scholarship.
Finally, although we applaud Josh
Zide's call fora non-disruptive protest
over walk-outs or picketing, we feel that
protesting Rice in her own home is rude
to her and detrimental to Stanford's
image ai large.
She was chosen for her prominence,
not her politics; politicizing the event by
protesting is unfair not only to her, but
also the vast majority of students who want
to their graduation to be focused on them
rather than on the war against terrorism.
Let us instead welcome the return of
one of the Stanford community's most dis
tinguished members, and consider her
choice and her speech as a part of the vari
ety of perspectives that the University
should dedicate itself to maintain.

ASSU officers apologize for 'failing to
moderate' meeting with Hennessy
On Feb. 12, University President John
Hennessy continued the annual tradition
of meeting with the ASSU legislative bod
ies (Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council). The purpose of this
meeting was to address various student
issues including health care, student
space, faculty diversity, housing, and in
terdisciplinary programs. Prior to the
meeting, twelve questions were submit
ted to President Hennessy, six on behalf
of each legislative body.
One particular question posed by an
undergraduate senator, regarding living
wage, coincided with the interests of stu
dents from the Coalition for Labor Justice.
In good faith, the ASSU President and
Vice President, in addition to a few under
graduate senators, made the decision to
defer the senate question regarding living
wage to members of the coalition, who
have been engaged in ongoing discussions
with administration regarding the issue.
Phis slight change of format (deferring
the question) occurred without the
knowledge of many elected officials, in
cluding Graduate Student Council mem
bers, and was intended to pose an impor
tant issue in the spirit of civility. Despite
this intent, the effects undermined stu
dent-administration relationships that we
have worked hard to develop.
Students from the Coalition for Labor
Justice exhibited disrespectful tones and
confrontational manners towards Hen
nessy. The ASSU held no intentions to
place 1 lennessy in a compromising situa
tion. We inadvertently allowed the meet
ing, designated with a specific purpose, to
stray from its mission.
()n behalf of the ASSU, we would like to
issue a formal apology for failing to mod

erate a meeting with deserved civil ex
change. We recognize the importance of
the issue and the value of Hennessy's will
ingness to listen. However, we strongly
disagree with the methods employed by
the Coalition for Labor Justice.
The behavior and attitudes demon
strated by these students in Tuesday's
meeting are not indicative of the relation
ship the ASSU seeks to maintain and de
velop with the University administration.

Seriate Chairperson responds
to SLAC's behavior
SLAC's presentation during Tuesday
night's annual meeting between Univer
sity President John Hennessy and mem
bers of the Undergraduate Senate, the
Graduate Student Council and the Pres
ident and Vice President of the ASSU
had three consequences:
First, by taking advantage of an ASSU
question-and-answer forum to shout slo
gans, demands and objections at I lcn
nessy, participating SLAC members have
jeopardized the relationship between the
ASSU and the administration.

Second, since the ASSU, and specifically
die Undergraduate Senate serves student
groups (including SLAC) as a means of ac
cess to this University's administrators,
members ofSLAG have therefore placed at
great risk the relationship between the stu
dent body and the administration.
Third, the question allotted to SLAC
was only one issue of 12 Hennessy intend
ed to address. By turning the question
and-answer session into an uncivil debate,
SLAC-'s presentation overshadowed nu
merous undergraduate concerns such as
the cancellation of the lAS program and a
perceived lack of socioeconomic diversity
in the admissions process, as well as vital
graduate concerns relating to health / de
pendent care and housing.
The Undergraduate Senate — as well
as numerous individual Senators — have
worked closely with SLAC this year on its
living wage campaign, have participated
in rallies and as Senators have represented
SLAC to the administration.
On Tuesday night, SLAC completely
undermined the Senate's efforts by taking
advantage of an opportunity to address
Hennessy with a question, and instead
using that time to disrespectfully confront
him with a list of accusations and demands.
As a facilitator, I was caught off guard,
since neither I nor any other representa
tive of the Undergraduate Senate were
aware of (he extent to which SLAC in
tended to act. Though I do not write this
on behalf of the Undergraduate Senate, as
its chair 1 consider the Senate to have been
humiliated and thoroughly embarrassed
by SIAC's behavior.
Do not mistake this as a criticism of
SLAC's work. This is not about issues. In
fact, the Senate has taken an officially
proactive and overwhelmingly supportive
role with respect to SLAC and the issues its
members represent.
However, the manner in which mem
bers of SLAC presented themselves on
Tuesday night detracted not only from
their own cause, but has potentially hurt
other groups' access to the administration
independently and via the ASSU.

Zide responds to Mcßride letter
I am writing to address points made in
Stephan Mcßride's interesting, though
borderline-libelous, response to my letter.
First, Mcßride describes my letter as "a
cloaked attempt to undermine the demo
cratic freedoms he stands to defend," hut
oilers no evidence to support this claim.
I can only assume that he makes this
statement because I disagree with the re
sults of a relatively democratic selection
process. 1 112 this is his contention, then it dis
plays a clear misunderstanding of the
principles behind democratic freedom:
the ability of a minority to disagree with a
majority opinion is one of the essen
tial of our freedoms.
I readily acknowledge that I disagree
with the Bush administration's politics
and actions — both overseas and at
home — but I did not, as Mcßride claims,
"impugn Rice's character."
I consider her an intelligent and articu
late woman. Instead, 1 call into question
the morality of our nation's behavior in
Afghanistan. Sunday's issue of The New
York Times details, for example, the Jan.
24 raid on the town of Oruzgan, in which
innocent civilians were killed on suspi
cions raised by unconfirmed intelligence
reports from questionable sources.
Tragically, this is just one of many such
instances, and the government has re
fused to be held accountable for any of

these "collateral damages," as they eu
phemistically refer to slaughtered inno
cents. Further, Bush is now attempting to
use his political popularity to begin simi
lar, misguided hostile action against the
so-called "Axis of Evil."
At home, the U.S.A. Patriot Act takes
away valuable freedoms and creates an at
mosphere conducive to what has been
widely described as the new McCarthyism
which has begun in recent months.
Mcßride describes universities as "cen
ters of free thought in the pursuit of excel
lence," but denies the validity of thought
which dissents from the majority opinion.
I agree that forming a non-disruptive
protest is divisive; those who share my po
litical views are a minority, hut in a free so
ciety, the minority has a right — and an
obligation — to make itself heard.
Inviting Rice to speak at our com
mencement politicizes the event, and I can
not in good conscience allow the Bush ad
ministation's political views to remain un
challenged simply because, "a substantial
majority of the citizenry of this country
support their president." The true patriots
in this country have always been those who
questioned the behavior of the govern
ment rather than those who blindly accept
it in the name of security: As Benjamin
Franklin wrote, "They that can give up es
sential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
To clarify my position, I intend to po
litely and attentively listen to what Rice has
to say because I feel free speech works best
in a respectful dialogue. However, making
it clear that there is a substantial dissenting
minority (again, without disturbing or
"ruining" graduation) is the essence of
"democratic freedoms" and "free thought
in pursuit of excellence."

Mcßride 'wrongfully and viciously'
attacked Zide
With his letter to the Daily, Stephan
Mcßride adds himself to those who try to

silence any opinion that is different than
theirs. Not only did he wrongfully and vi
ciously attack Josh Zide on his democratic
beliefs, but he also distorted some of the
statements made in Zide's letter.
Nowhere in Zide's manuscript did I see
any insulting comment regarding Rice.
The killing of Afghan citizens is a fact,
whether we believe that it is light or
wrong. And the point made by Zide, at
least as 1 understand it, is that by inviting
Rice — who currently has a major impact
on the U.S. anti-terrorist actions — to de
liver a commencement speech in which no
other voices will be heard, Stanford risks
taking sides in a very important, and in my
opinion controversial, issue, in the case
that Rice chooses to give a political speech.
In case it is not obvious by now, I
would like to specify that what 1 find an
noying in Mcßride's letter is not his sup
port of Rice, since 1 respect his opinion,
but his claiming to be defending demo
cratic: freedom against the "cloaked at
tempt" of Zide.
To me, judging from his manuscript,
he sounds more like the person that he ac
cuses Mr. Zide to be. Democratic freedom
is undermined by not letting opposition be
heard, by treating the people who dare to
express different opinions — or even to
offer some constructive criticism —as
"less patriotic" or traitors, by oversimplify
ing a complicated war with many causes
and implications to the battle of the good
versus t he evil, by justifying the war not on
the grounds of punishing those that are
responsible for the attacks but on reaf
firming the "less-than-submissive" nature
of the government.
Those that question the current U.S.
actions are in no way supporters of Osama
bin Laden. They are doing so because they
ask themselves if there is a way that the ter
rorists that caused so much grief to the
American people and thousands of fami
lies be punished without having to cause
the same grief to the families of thousands
of innocent Afghans who have fewer ties
with Osama bin Laden and the dictator
ships that have nurtured him than some of
the previous U.S. administrations.

Those who question believe that there
should be a more open discussion on what
the U.S. reaction should be, hoping that
the collateral damage can be reduced.
They fear that ac tions that are not careful
ly planned may ignite a series of more
catastrophic events that could eventually
backfire on the American nation.
Of course, nobody is obliged to agree
with these views, and history will prove
which side is right. But 1 think that if we
are to defend democracy, these opinions
should be treated with respect and be con
fronted with arguments and not with un
justified attacks on people's patriotism and
democratic beliefs.
As for Mcßride's argument on the sup
port of the majority, I would like to re
mind him just a few of the many times in
American history that the obvious was
eventually proven to be wrong: the mas
sacre of the American Indians, slavery and
abolitionism, women's rights, Jim Crow,
McCarthyism.

Choice of Rice is appropriate
As the Feb. 11 letter by Josh Zide and a
spate of all-campus mailings have demon
strated, there is a significant minority of
students who believe that Condoleezza
Rice is an inappropriate choice fora grad
uation speaker.
That is especially sad since we believe
that Stanford has rarely had so distin
guished a member of its own community
come back to speak at graduation. Rice is
a part of Stanford — she came here over
20 years ago as a fellow in a disarmament
program, stayed to become a full profes
sor in the political science department
and most especially served as provost for
six years. She even attained that special
mark of distinction as a Stanford institu
tion by having a whole song at Gaieties
devoted to her last year.
Like her or not, she's one of our own,
and by speaking at Commencement,
she is returning home to the place

where she spent most of the last 20 years
of her life.
We seniors feel that the choice ol Rice
as graduation speaker is appropriate and
that, by her acceptance, the University it
