ASSU officers apologize for 'failing to
moderate' meeting with Hennessy
On Feb. 12, University President John
Hennessy continued the annual tradition
of meeting with the ASSU legislative bod
ies (Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council). The purpose of this
meeting was to address various student
issues including health care, student
space, faculty diversity, housing, and in
terdisciplinary programs. Prior to the
meeting, twelve questions were submit
ted to President Hennessy, six on behalf
of each legislative body.
One particular question posed by an
undergraduate senator, regarding living
wage, coincided with the interests of stu
dents from the Coalition for Labor Justice.
In good faith, the ASSU President and
Vice President, in addition to a few under
graduate senators, made the decision to
defer the senate question regarding living
wage to members of the coalition, who
have been engaged in ongoing discussions
with administration regarding the issue.
Phis slight change of format (deferring
the question) occurred without the
knowledge of many elected officials, in
cluding Graduate Student Council mem
bers, and was intended to pose an impor
tant issue in the spirit of civility. Despite
this intent, the effects undermined stu
dent-administration relationships that we
have worked hard to develop.
Students from the Coalition for Labor
Justice exhibited disrespectful tones and
confrontational manners towards Hen
nessy. The ASSU held no intentions to
place 1 lennessy in a compromising situa
tion. We inadvertently allowed the meet
ing, designated with a specific purpose, to
stray from its mission.
()n behalf of the ASSU, we would like to
issue a formal apology for failing to mod

erate a meeting with deserved civil ex
change. We recognize the importance of
the issue and the value of Hennessy's will
ingness to listen. However, we strongly
disagree with the methods employed by
the Coalition for Labor Justice.
The behavior and attitudes demon
strated by these students in Tuesday's
meeting are not indicative of the relation
ship the ASSU seeks to maintain and de
velop with the University administration.

Seriate Chairperson responds
to SLAC's behavior
SLAC's presentation during Tuesday
night's annual meeting between Univer
sity President John Hennessy and mem
bers of the Undergraduate Senate, the
Graduate Student Council and the Pres
ident and Vice President of the ASSU
had three consequences:
First, by taking advantage of an ASSU
question-and-answer forum to shout slo
gans, demands and objections at I lcn
nessy, participating SLAC members have
jeopardized the relationship between the
ASSU and the administration.

Second, since the ASSU, and specifically
die Undergraduate Senate serves student
groups (including SLAC) as a means of ac
cess to this University's administrators,
members ofSLAG have therefore placed at
great risk the relationship between the stu
dent body and the administration.
Third, the question allotted to SLAC
was only one issue of 12 Hennessy intend
ed to address. By turning the question
and-answer session into an uncivil debate,
SLAC-'s presentation overshadowed nu
merous undergraduate concerns such as
the cancellation of the lAS program and a
perceived lack of socioeconomic diversity
in the admissions process, as well as vital
graduate concerns relating to health / de
pendent care and housing.
The Undergraduate Senate — as well
as numerous individual Senators — have
worked closely with SLAC this year on its
living wage campaign, have participated
in rallies and as Senators have represented
SLAC to the administration.
On Tuesday night, SLAC completely
undermined the Senate's efforts by taking
advantage of an opportunity to address
Hennessy with a question, and instead
using that time to disrespectfully confront
him with a list of accusations and demands.
As a facilitator, I was caught off guard,
since neither I nor any other representa
tive of the Undergraduate Senate were
aware of (he extent to which SLAC in
tended to act. Though I do not write this
on behalf of the Undergraduate Senate, as
its chair 1 consider the Senate to have been
humiliated and thoroughly embarrassed
by SIAC's behavior.
Do not mistake this as a criticism of
SLAC's work. This is not about issues. In
fact, the Senate has taken an officially
proactive and overwhelmingly supportive
