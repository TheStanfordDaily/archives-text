BASEBALL
Tuesday: No. 1 Stanford 8, Brigham
Young 1

. On Tuesday night at Sunken Diamond,
No. 1 Stanford (5-2) continued its hot play with
an 8-1 victory over Brigham Young (2-8), as
four Cardinal pitchers combined to hold the
Cougars to just three hits.
Junior southpaw Tim Cunningham (2-0)
got the win for Stanford, allowing only one hit
over four innings before handing the game
over to a trio of relievers, each ofwhom thrived
in their first collegiate appearances.
While the usual suspects out of the bullpen
remained in the dugout, junior Darin Naat
jes, sophomore David O'Hagan, and fresh
man Jonny Dyer finished the job impeccably,
striking out nine while allowing only two hits
and one run collectively in their five innings
of work.

"That's one of the advantages of a mid-week
game," said head coach Mark Marquess. "It
kind of forces us to use some of the other guys
and get them another team to pitch against,
rather than inter-squad games, and they re
sponded well to it. They did an outstanding job
— all three of them."
That the three neophytes performed so
well is an absolute boon for the Cardinal,
with the bullpen rotation still very much up
in the air. Perhaps the most impressive dis
play on the night was thiit of rookie Dyer,
who stepped onto the mound in the ninth in
ning and promptly struck out the side on 12
pitches.
The victory was a game of firsts in some
more ways, as centerfielder Sam Fuld and first
baseman Donny Lucy both knocked in their
first collegiate home runs.
Fuld, a sophomore third-team preseason
Ail-American, pulled a 3-1 fastball over the
right-field fence in the first inning, giving the
Cardinal a 2-0 lead that it never relinquished.
Surprisingly, although Fuld had a great
freshman season last year — batting .357 and
knocking in 37 RBI — the steady contact hitter
had yet to hit a home run until Tuesday.
After the game, Fuld said, "It was a big relief
to get that monkey off my back. Honestly, I've
been trying not to think about it too much but
it's been in the back of my mind, so it's good to
get it out of the way."
The score remained 2-0 until the fifth inning
when the Cardinal piled on five runs, capped
off by the freshman Lucy's three-run blast to

left field. Getting his fourth straight start, Lucy
continued his torrid play — he has 10 RBI in
those four starts — in his bid fora permanent
starting role.
Lucy is a manager's dream because of his
great versatility. Early in the season, Coach
Marquess has already played him at catcher,
first base, left field, and as a designated hitter.
BYU picked up one run in the seventh as
Lars Birkeland singled home Mark Wein
garten to make the score 7-1, but the Cardi
nal quickly responded in the eighth, when se
nior shortstop Scott Dragicevich led off with
a triple and Andy Topham brought him
home with an RBI single.
With that single, third baseman Topham ex
tended his team-high hitting steak to six games,
while Dragicevich had another great day at the
plate, raising his team-leading batting average
up to .448. The senior shortstop went 3 for 3
with a single, double, and a triple in what was
his sixth multi-hit game out of the season's first
seven games.
While Cardinal starter Tim Cunningham
rebounded to pick up the win after a subpar
performance this past weekend at Florida
State, the Cougars' Jeff Stone was pinned with
the loss to bring him to 0-2 on the season.
Stone allowed five hits and seven runs, all
earned, over 4 2/3 innings, as the lefthander
was killed by the two Stanford longballs.
The Cardinal will travel to Fresno State fora
three-game set this weekend, where the team
hopes to maintain its high level of play on the
short season.
