The Pac-10 Championships in
Long Beach, Calif, are just two
weeks away and Ripple and Foschi
are top-ranked nationally in the 200
butterfly and 500 freestyle, respec
tively, and are heavily favored to
win those events and others at the
NCAA Championship Meet on
Mar. 21 -23 in Austin, Texas.
But NCAA's are nothing new for
either Foschi or Ripple. They have
qualified with the"A" standard
every collegiate season they have
competed. Foschi is the reigning
NCAA champion in the 500
freestyle and notched her 17th con
secutive win in the event last week
against USC. She also grabbed run

ner-up in the 1650 freestyle at last
year's NCAA championship meet.
Ripple too, is a NCA\ champion
in the 200 and 400 medley relays.
During her senior Season, she's
qualified for the NCAA's in 11
events including the 200 butterfly
and the 200 medley relay
"Whether in competition or
practice, Shelly and Jess step up
to gel the job done in critical situ
ations," said head coach Richard
Quick. "I wouldn't have to be
paid to coach Jessica Foschi and
Shelly Ripple."
. A native New Yorker, Foschi
began swimming at age four with
siblings Pam, J.P. and Christian
during summers at the family's
Manhasset country club. Foschi has
fond memories of her early swim
ming days at the country club.
"I would lay my bathing suit out
the night before the champi
onships at the end of the summer,"
said Foschi. "I got so excited even
though it was just to swim one lap.
Looking back at those summers
makes me happy. 1 understand all
over again why I wanted to swim in
the first place."
Foschi is very close to her family
