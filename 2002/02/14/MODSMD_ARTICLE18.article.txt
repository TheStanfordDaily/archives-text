swimming team as it prepares to de

dual meet of the season against Cal
this Saturday.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford
vs. California, Avery Aquatic
Center

The Pac-10 Championships in
Long Beach, Calif, are just two
weeks away and Ripple and Foschi
are top-ranked nationally in the 200
butterfly and 500 freestyle, respec
tively, and are heavily favored to
win those events and others at the
NCAA Championship Meet on
Mar. 21 -23 in Austin, Texas.
But NCAA's are nothing new for
either Foschi or Ripple. They have
qualified with the"A" standard
every collegiate season they have
competed. Foschi is the reigning
NCAA champion in the 500
freestyle and notched her 17th con
secutive win in the event last week
against USC. She also grabbed run

ner-up in the 1650 freestyle at last
year's NCAA championship meet.
Ripple too, is a NCA\ champion
in the 200 and 400 medley relays.
During her senior Season, she's
qualified for the NCAA's in 11
events including the 200 butterfly
and the 200 medley relay
"Whether in competition or
practice, Shelly and Jess step up
to gel the job done in critical situ
ations," said head coach Richard
Quick. "I wouldn't have to be
paid to coach Jessica Foschi and
Shelly Ripple."
. A native New Yorker, Foschi
began swimming at age four with
siblings Pam, J.P. and Christian
during summers at the family's
Manhasset country club. Foschi has
fond memories of her early swim
ming days at the country club.
"I would lay my bathing suit out
the night before the champi
onships at the end of the summer,"
said Foschi. "I got so excited even
though it was just to swim one lap.
Looking back at those summers
makes me happy. 1 understand all
over again why I wanted to swim in
the first place."
Foschi is very close to her family

Jessica Foschi, the reigning NCAA champion in the 500 freestyle, extended
her consecutive win streak in the event to 17 last weekend against USC.
and parents Bob and Margaret
have always been very supportive.
As a child, Foschi played basketball,
volleyball, lacrosse, and softball. At
age 11, however, she began to focus
on swimming. She joined a local
team, the Long Island Aquatic
(Mub, and quickly amazed parents
and coaches with her rapid im
provement, qualifying for junior
nationals in 1993 and U.S. nationals
in spring 1994. Fhe next year, she
joined Rippleon the national junior
team in Paris.
Foschi attended Friends Acade
my in Ix>ng Island. Although the
school had no swim team, Foschi
swam independently at state meets
and set New York state records in
the 200 and 500 freestyle.
"At Stanford, I discovered who
I was," Foschi said. "It translated
to the pool. In addition, there is a
lot of team bonding. Even
though swimming is an individ
ual sport, the collegiate experi
ence is about training with other
swimmers and coaches. That's
why swimming here is so great,
you swim more fort he team."
Ripple is a native of Baton
Rouge, La. Her athletic success
also runs in the family. I ler father,
Steve, was a linebacker at LSU and
her mother, Jan, was a profession
al triathlete for 10 years and swam

in the 197(i U.S. Olympic Trials.
She attended Parkview Baptist
High School and was a four-time
Ail-American. Ripple set a National
Independent High School record
in the 100 backstroke in 1998 and is
the holder of more than 60 state
swimming records in Louisiana and
led her high school to four straight
championships.
She is one of the top swim
mers in the nation and fhe
world, and, as she continues to
improve during her final season,
she's solidifying her place among
Stanford's all-time Top 10 in
seven different events
Ripple has a friendly compet
itive spirit. She loves to race and
possesses an extremely high level
of determination, which has
been her key to success in so
many meets.
Foschi and Ripple have been an
unbreakable force, uniting the un
usually large team this year with
their hard work and excellence.
"We all look to Jess and Shelly for
inspiration and dedication," said
sophomore I laley Champion.
"I never want to take for granted
the great and consistent job that Jes
sica Foschi and Shelly Ripple always
do," Coach Quick said.
Foschi, a political science major
and human biology minor, is con
sidering law school. Ripple will be
graduating in June with a degree in
communication. Both hope to par
ticipate in the 2004 Summer
Olympics in Athens.

paid to coach Jessica Foschi and
Shelly Ripple."

began swimming at age four with
siblings Pam, J.P. and Christian
during summers at the family's
Manhasset country club. Foschi has
fond memories of her early swim
ming days at the country club.
"I would lay my bathing suit out
the night before the champi
onships at the end of the summer,"
said Foschi. "I got so excited even
though it was just to swim one lap.
Looking back at those summers
makes me happy. 1 understand all
over again why I wanted to swim in
the first place."

volleyball, lacrosse, and softball. At

Foschi attended Friends Acade
my in Ix>ng Island. Although the
school had no swim team, Foschi
swam independently at state meets
and set New York state records in
the 200 and 500 freestyle.
"At Stanford, I discovered who
I was," Foschi said. "It translated
to the pool. In addition, there is a
lot of team bonding. Even
though swimming is an individ
ual sport, the collegiate experi
ence is about training with other
swimmers and coaches. That's
why swimming here is so great,
you swim more fort he team."
Ripple is a native of Baton
Rouge, La. Her athletic success
also runs in the family. I ler father,
Steve, was a linebacker at LSU and
her mother, Jan, was a profession
al triathlete for 10 years and swam

in the 100 backstroke in 1998 and is
the holder of more than 60 state
swimming records in Louisiana and
led her high school to four straight
championships.
She is one of the top swim
mers in the nation and fhe
world, and, as she continues to
improve during her final season,
she's solidifying her place among
Stanford's all-time Top 10 in
seven different events
Ripple has a friendly compet
itive spirit. She loves to race and
possesses an extremely high level
of determination, which has
been her key to success in so
many meets.
Foschi and Ripple have been an
unbreakable force, uniting the un
usually large team this year with
their hard work and excellence.
"We all look to Jess and Shelly for
inspiration and dedication," said
sophomore I laley Champion.
"I never want to take for granted
the great and consistent job that Jes
sica Foschi and Shelly Ripple always
do," Coach Quick said.
Foschi, a political science major
and human biology minor, is con
sidering law school. Ripple will be
graduating in June with a degree in
