er against UC-Riverside (2-6)
on Thursday.
The Cardinal enters the dou
bleheader riding high off of two
big victories last weekend against
No. 19 Pacific. The pitching staff,
lineup and defense proved tough
in the 16 innings of play.
Challenging the Cardinal staff
for the Highlanders will be fresh
man Colby Kelly, who is batting
.286 on the season with a team
high six hits. Sophomore Jenell
Jackson has seen the most time in
the circle for Riverside, she holds
a 2-2 record and a 1.42 ERA in 25
1/3 innings pitched.
At this weekend's Campbell /
Cartier Classic, the team will face
No. 10 Cal State-Fullerton (3-4),
Cal State-Northridge (5-5), Utah

State (0-5), No. 23 Saq Diego (4-5)
and New Mexico (0-2) over three
days of play.
Stanford currently boasts an
18-5 all-time record at the tour

The Cardinal kicks off tourna
ment play against its highest
ranked opponent so far this sea
son, No. 10 Cal State-Fullerton.
The Titans enter the tournament
after going 2-3 in the Fiesta Bowl
Classic, capped off by a 9-1 rout of
Texas on the final day.
Big West Player of the Week,
senior Monica Lucatero, will
look to shake up the Cardinal
pitching for the Titans. Lu
catero hit .636 in five games,
going 7 for 11 with two runs
scored, four RBI and four walks.
She was 1 for 2 in Cal State-
Fullerton's victory over Fresno
State on Friday and a perfect 3
for 3 with two runs and an RBI
against Texas on Sunday in the
tournament finale for both
teams.
Cardinal juniors Tori Ny
berg, Maureen LeCocq and
Dana Sorensen will do every
thing they can to stop Lucatero
and the rest of the Titans from
continuing their success in the
batter's box.

Nybergand LeCocq both shut
down the Pacific lineup in their
outings last weekend and will try
to duplicate this success in tour
nament play this weekend.
"Maureen and Fori both did
an excellent job in the circle this
past weekend," said head coach
John Rittman. "They now just
need to use the weekend as a tool
while we are on the road."

the Titans, the Cardinal takes
