T he season's first game is only days away, and
the Stanford women's lacrosse team is anxious for
action after months of hard work in the offseason.
This Saturday's game at UC-Davis will be the first
test for the team t hat came away from last season
with its fourth-consecutive Western Women's
Lacrosse League Conference Championship.
The Cardinal debuted in the national rank
ings last year, climbing as high as No. 20, and look
to be a continued national presence this year.
Ultimately, the team hopes to earn a bid to the
NCAA tournament in May. Based on last year's

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
Saturday: Stanford vs. No. 10 Syracuse,
New Moloney Field

promising performances, there's no reason to
doubt that a bid is a good possibility.
One point of strength which is carried over
from last year is head coach Michele Uhlfelder, a
2001 World Cup Champion in lacrosse. Uhlfelder
was a member and captain of the No. I ranked
Maryland lacrosse team; she went on to serve as as
sistant coach at Duke University, as well as con
tributing asa member of the U.S. National Team.
She's assisted by a staff of three, including

Quinn Carney (two-time Ail-American at Mary
land), Liz Kittleman (Union '98), and Amy
Harms, (St. Mary's '01).
The staft*has led the team on two pre-season
trips already. The Cardinal faced oft'against
teams in Colorado and North Carolina, includ
ing top-ranked Duke and Johns Hopkins.
Also providing leadership are the three cap
tains, seniors Emily Rodriguez and Liz Britt and
junior Kim Cahill.
Attacker Cahill has come back strong after
recovering from an anterior c ruciate ligament
tear from last season. Both midfielder Ro-
driguez and attacker ftritt add
great experience to the team, hav
ing played in all 58 games since
their arrival here at Stanford.
This experience will complement
the talented young team of nine
newcomers and 12 returners.
Sophomore attacker Jess Scott
says, "We're excited about the fact

that a lot of our new teammates
have come up against still competi
tion in the past, and we know they'll
add a lot of strength and experi
ence to our team in this season."
This Saturday the Cardinal kicks
off its regular season with a game at
Davis. Stanford is excited to come up
against the Aggies who is traditional
ly very aggressive. This game should
prove to be a good lead into next
week's first annual East / West Chal
lenge against Syracuse, who finished
second in the Big East last season.
