If there was any doubt that No. 8 Stan
ford (7-0, 6-4, Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) got back on track when it beat
No. 14 Cal State-North ridge last week
end, the Cardinal erased any remaining
skepticism with a 30-25, 30-25, 30-25,
sweep of No. 15 University of Ihe Pacific
(3-10, 1-8) on Tuesday night.
During a five-match losing streak, the
Cardinal slipped from its No. 2 ranking
down to No. 8.

Sunday: No. 8 Stanford defeated
No, 14 Cal-State Northridae, 30-25,
30-25, 30-25

Though the Cardinal decisively
downed the Tiger squad in less than an
hour during its Jan. 15 match, this time a
win was in question because of two signifi
cant and confounding factors.
First, the Pacific team that Stanford
faced earlier in the season was short key
players due to suspension. Stanford faced

the challenge of beating the new-and-im
proved Tiger team.
Second, Stanford would be playing
without the efforts of Ail-American junior
opposite Curt Toppel, who leads the team
with 5.41 kills per game â€” one of the high
est averages in the league. Toppel missed
the match due to personal reasons.
Also missing from the roster was fresh
man outside hitter David Vogel, who was
sidelined with the flu, trimming the team
to only 11 players.
However, the Cardinal displayed no
sign of being disadvantaged as team mem

bers seamlessly filled the voids.
"It was a team effort, a matter of other
guys filling in, doing their jobs and then
some," said head coach Don Shaw. " There
was a more even distribution offensively."
Junior middle blocker Paul Bocage led
the Cardinal with a team-high I\\ kills and
.500 hitting percentage.
"Paul gave great offense; we needed
that to pick up a lot of the slack," said Shaw.
The Cardinal balanced their offense
against Pacific, as four players posted nine
or more kills. Against Nortbridge, the
team notched a comparable number of

kills Inn relied on two players to do so.
Stanford will face the toughest competi
tion in the league when top-ranked UCLA
(I 1 -1,0-0) comes to the Farm on Saturday
altera Friday night matchup with Pacific.
Facing a tired, traveling team with less
than a day test between matches may give
the (lardinal an advantage. And Stanford
needs every advantage it can get.
Stanford is 2-0 against top-10 teams after
falling to No. I lawaii and No. 5 Petin State.
