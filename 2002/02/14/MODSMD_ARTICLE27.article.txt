Burnham Pavilion.
Against Davis, Stanford (9-8, 2-4
Pacific-10 Conference) was in posi
tion to take the match bei<>» - e letting
a lead slip away in the final three
bouts.
Junior Brad Selby's major deci
sion over Flynn Ficker at 285

pounds evened the score after the
Aggies opened with a major dec ision
at 197 pounds.
The Cardinal dropped the next
two Units by narrow margins, as
Davis took a 10-4 lead.
Redshirt freshman Brad Metzler
responded with a close decision in
Stanford's favor at 141 pounds to
bring the Cardinal within three
points at 10-7.
Fellow redshirt freshman Matt
Gentry, who has been virtually au
tomatic this year, earned his 30th
win of the season in fine fashion,
with a 10-2 major decision at 149
pounds. Gentry's fourteenth
straight win also put Stanford
ahead for the first time, 11-10.
Stanford continued to roll at
157 pounds, as senior Levi Weikel-
Magden solidified his position
heading into the Pac-10 Champi
onships with a 10-0 major decision
over Aggie Jeremiah jarvis.
Fourth-ranked Weikel-Magden's
victory avenged a loss to third

record," Buddie said. "A win against
Portland State would accomplish that
feat, an impressive improvement

over last year's 4-10 final record."
The Vikings (8-11, .3-4 Pac-10),

will battle San Francisco Suite earlier
in the day.
Portland Suite's Jeremy Wilson is
