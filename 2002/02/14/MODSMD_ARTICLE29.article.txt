# Tarns squad back in the nations elite
## History revisited? 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
You could say it was an omen.
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team inaugurated Hay
Area collegiate basketball in 1896
when it defeated California 2-1,
the first in a long line of triumphs
for the Indians (and now the Car
dinal). And even though the
scores are a bit different now, one
thing hasn't changed â€” Stan
ford is still beating Cal.
However, in all other respects,
the women's basketball program
here at Stanford has come a long
way in its celebrated and decorat
ed history.
As a university, Stanford is no
stranger to championships and
the women's basketball team is
no exception. Under the leader
ship of head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, the Cardinal brought
home two national champi
onships in the 1989-90 and 1991-
92 seasons. The titles cap a spate
of impressive post-seasons, in
cluding five NCAA Final Four
appearances, three trips to the
Elite Eight, and two visits to the
Sweet Sixteen in just 15 seasons
with VanDerveer at the helm.
Such consistency highlights
t he strength of the program and
the quality of players on its roster.
"We have really bright players
who work very hard and are ex
cited to play in the tournament,"
said VanDerveer. "They love to
play and they love competition."
Many have continued to pur
sue the game in their days after

leaving the Farm. Stanford had
10 former players on WN BA ros
ters last season, more than any
other school in the country.
To those who have paid even a
smattering of attention to
women's basketball in the last
decade, the names Jennifer Azzi,
Sonja Henning, Val Whiting, Kate
Starbird, Jamila Wideman,
Vanessa Nygaard and Kristin
Folkl, just to name a tew, represent
major figureheads of the sport.
Azzi and Starbird both shared
the honor of being selected for
women's basketball's highest col
legiate honor, the James Nai
smith National Player of the Yeai -
Award, in 1989-90 and 1996-97,
respectively. Each demonstrated
many of the qualities that have
made each Cardinal squad so ef L
fective as a team.
"Jennifer was an All-American
and a competitor," VanDerveer
said. "She was very team-orient
ed and wasn't afraid to have real
high goals. [ Kate] made big plays
and I think great players make
big plays."
"But with all of these great
teams they were not one-player
stories at all," said VanDerveer.
" There's just so much talent
around them and that's similar to
this team."
Indeed, one can draw many
parallels between the teams of the
past and the team of the present.
This Cardinal squad is cur
rently ranked No. 2 in the nation.
After last weekend's sweep of the
Oregon schools, it has assured it
self of at least a share of an 11th

regular season Pacific 10 Confer
ence title. A win tonight against
Washington will give the team
the No. 1 seed ill the new confer
ence tournament, with the tour
nament deciding the conference
champion and recipient of the
automatic NCAA bid.
And following in the foot
steps of A/zi and Starbird, the
Cardinal has its own Naismith
Finalist in sophomore forward
Nicole Powell.
Powell received the Pac-10
Freshman of the Year honor last
season, and her performance this
past weekend earned her the Pac
-10 Player of the Week distinction
for the fourth time this season.
Her teammate and the Cardi
nal's leading scorer, senior Lind
sey Yamasaki, has also received
the Pac-10 Player of the Week
honor this season, helping give
Stanford one of t he most danger
ous perimeters in the game.
"This team has a lot of great
similarities to championship
teams in that everyone works re
ally hard," VanDerveer said. "We
have great players who step up
every night and are consistent.
People know and accept roles on
their team and are happy and re
alize that the team is successful
collectively, not individually."
flie current Cardinal mem
bers are not unaware of the tradi
tion they belong to, and they
want to add to their own entry on
that legacy.
