# Hennessy talks with GSC reps

### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University President John
I lennessy addressed a number
of questions from undergrad
uates at Tuesday's question
and-answer session with the

ASSU, includ
ing campus
labor. Hen
nessy also tack-

led six presubmitted questions
from the Graduate Student
Council regarding a variety of
financial issues.
Graduate students were wor
ried about the affordability of
basic needs — particularly
health and housing — when
minimum stipends start as low
as $ 14,000 per year.
"I think all [graduate] stu
dents know how difficult i( is at
the end of the month to pay the
bill," said GSC Chair Felipe
Santos, a third-year doctoral
candidate in management sci
ence and engineering.
Hennessy said that the cam
pus was facing some difficult fi
nancial issues, and that the ad
ministration had asked all units
to present budgets with 5 per
cent cuts.
He noted that Stanford's
debt-to-equity ratio is prob
lematic and prevents Stanford
from enacting expensive or
quick solutions. The 20 to 30
percent returns on t he endow
ment that existed only a few
years ago have dwindled in
the past year to "single-digit
returns."
"We've been raising debt at
a precipitous rate . . . pri
marily to deal with housing
projects," Hennessy said.
"Our primary problem is
managing that debt.
Nonetheless ... I think we're
going to try and find a way for
the grad students to be hold
ing their own, and maybe

make up a little ground."
Hennessy addressed the lack
of housing, a long-time bane of
Stanford grad students.
"I think everybody knows
this is a priority for us," Hen
nessy said.
He explained that three Es-

con dido Vil
lage buildings
will open be
tween 2002

and 2005, providing nearly an
extra 350 housing spaces for
graduate students. A complex
of Escondido Village two-bed
room apartments will also be
come available in 2006, creat
ing an extra 240 spots.
In addition, Hennessy said
Stanford was working to build a
Law School residence in the
manner of the Business
School's Schwab Residential
Center. Like Schwab, it would
be heavily donor-funded.
"That said, we'll have to use a
combination of debt and dona
tions to do the graduate student
housing," Hennessy said.
Health care was another big
issue Tuesday night.
"I wish I had a simple answer
for this question," Hennessy
said. "I am extremely frustrated
about this issue. 1 have tried to
find a solution. I am frustrated
that I cannot find a solution."
Premiums for Stanford's
about 8,000 graduate students
are projected to soon increase
between 25 and 50 percent.
They currently consume close
to 15 percent of graduate stu
dent incomes. On average, pre
miums require about 3 to 4 per
cent of a person's income. In
addition, 5 percent of student
dependents — spouses and
children — are uninsured.
According to Hennessy, a
past proposal to have all stu
dents pay extra money — $3

to $4 more for premiums — to
cross-subsidize health care for
dependents wasn't popular,
and graduate students admit
ted such a solution was very
controversial.
"I'll be honest with you . . . I'm
not optimistic we're going to find a
solution for the dependent health
care problem," I lennessy said.
"This is a problem for the Uni
versity as a whole," he continued.
"I lealth care plans for faculty and
staff are going up significantly."
This was precipitated partly, he
said, by the financial woes of the

Stanford Medical Center.
Hennessy said he would do his
best with the issue, but said it was
doubtful that the Medical Center
could subsidize health care as it
had done in the past.
"We're asking them to lose
more money," he said.
"It seems unfathomable that
I'm going to be working at the
[ Medical Center] and not get med
ical care there," first-year medical
student Grace Chang said after
the meeting.
"I actually was optimistic
about health care," Lisa Wong, a
second-year biophysics student,
said. "He seems committed to a
solution — he's not going to let
it go."
"Someting's going to hap

pen," Chang said. "Health care is
on the table."
According to Chang, the cur
rent health care contract will end
on Aug. 31.
"You can't have 8,000 unin
sured [graduate students]," she
said.
CSC Financial Officer Ray
Rivera, one of the graduate stu
dents working on health care, said
he thought Hennessy addressed
the issue well.
"I think it set it good tone with
our future work with the Presi
dent," he said.
"These are all big, big issues,"
Rivera, a second year student in
symbolic systems in education,
said. "I think he's hoping the stu
dents will come [and help]."

of questions from undergrad
uates at Tuesday's question
and-answer session with the

ASSU, includ
ing campus
labor. Hen
nessy also tack-

led six presubmitted questions
from the Graduate Student
Council regarding a variety of
financial issues.
Graduate students were wor
ried about the affordability of
basic needs — particularly
health and housing — when
minimum stipends start as low
as $ 14,000 per year.
"I think all [graduate] stu
dents know how difficult i( is at
the end of the month to pay the
bill," said GSC Chair Felipe
Santos, a third-year doctoral
candidate in management sci
ence and engineering.
Hennessy said that the cam
pus was facing some difficult fi
nancial issues, and that the ad
ministration had asked all units
to present budgets with 5 per
cent cuts.
He noted that Stanford's
debt-to-equity ratio is prob
lematic and prevents Stanford
from enacting expensive or
quick solutions. The 20 to 30
percent returns on t he endow
ment that existed only a few
years ago have dwindled in
the past year to "single-digit
returns."
"We've been raising debt at
a precipitous rate . . . pri
marily to deal with housing
projects," Hennessy said.
"Our primary problem is
managing that debt.
Nonetheless ... I think we're
going to try and find a way for
the grad students to be hold
ing their own, and maybe

make up a little ground."
Hennessy addressed the lack
of housing, a long-time bane of
Stanford grad students.
"I think everybody knows
this is a priority for us," Hen
nessy said.
He explained that three Es-

con dido Vil
lage buildings
will open be
tween 2002

and 2005, providing nearly an
extra 350 housing spaces for
graduate students. A complex
of Escondido Village two-bed
room apartments will also be
come available in 2006, creat
ing an extra 240 spots.
In addition, Hennessy said
Stanford was working to build a
Law School residence in the
manner of the Business
School's Schwab Residential
Center. Like Schwab, it would
be heavily donor-funded.
"That said, we'll have to use a
combination of debt and dona
tions to do the graduate student
housing," Hennessy said.
Health care was another big
issue Tuesday night.
"I wish I had a simple answer
for this question," Hennessy
said. "I am extremely frustrated
about this issue. 1 have tried to
find a solution. I am frustrated
that I cannot find a solution."
Premiums for Stanford's
about 8,000 graduate students
are projected to soon increase
between 25 and 50 percent.
They currently consume close
to 15 percent of graduate stu
dent incomes. On average, pre
miums require about 3 to 4 per
cent of a person's income. In
addition, 5 percent of student
dependents — spouses and
children — are uninsured.
According to Hennessy, a
past proposal to have all stu
dents pay extra money — $3

to $4 more for premiums — to
cross-subsidize health care for
dependents wasn't popular,
and graduate students admit
ted such a solution was very
controversial.
"I'll be honest with you . . . I'm
not optimistic we're going to find a
solution for the dependent health
care problem," I lennessy said.
"This is a problem for the Uni
versity as a whole," he continued.
"I lealth care plans for faculty and
staff are going up significantly."
This was precipitated partly, he
said, by the financial woes of the

Stanford Medical Center.
Hennessy said he would do his
best with the issue, but said it was
doubtful that the Medical Center
could subsidize health care as it
had done in the past.
"We're asking them to lose
more money," he said.
"It seems unfathomable that
I'm going to be working at the
[ Medical Center] and not get med
ical care there," first-year medical
student Grace Chang said after
the meeting.
"I actually was optimistic
about health care," Lisa Wong, a
second-year biophysics student,
said. "He seems committed to a
solution — he's not going to let
it go."
"Someting's going to hap

pen," Chang said. "Health care is
on the table."
According to Chang, the cur
rent health care contract will end
on Aug. 31.
"You can't have 8,000 unin
sured [graduate students]," she
said.
CSC Financial Officer Ray
Rivera, one of the graduate stu
dents working on health care, said
he thought Hennessy addressed
the issue well.
"I think it set it good tone with
our future work with the Presi
dent," he said.
"These are all big, big issues,"
Rivera, a second year student in
symbolic systems in education,
said. "I think he's hoping the stu
dents will come [and help]."
