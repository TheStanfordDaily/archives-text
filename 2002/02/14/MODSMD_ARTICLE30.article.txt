# Seniors to close out run
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
After four years of toil, sweat,
heartbreak and joy, the five seniors
on the women's basketball team
have reached the end of their tour
year journey. Come Sunday, there
will be no more Brickyard Club, no
more of Maples' bouncing floor, no
more "All Right Now" emanating
from the Band.
The next time Bethany
Donaphin, Cori Enghusen, Enjoli
Izidor, Lauren St. Clair and Lind
sey Yamasaki watch a regular sea
son game at Maples Pavilion, it will
be as spectators, rather than partic
ipants â€” though they may still have
a couple games t here left. Given the
Cardinal's outstanding record, a
first round game in the NCAA tour
nament at Maples as a No. 1
through No. 4 seed is highly likely.
In their four years on the court,
the seniors have played over 100
games, with the Cardinal enjoying
a .713 winning percentage during
that time.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Today: No. 2 Sfanford vs.
Washington, 7 p.m., Maples
Pavilion
Saturday: No. 2 Sfanford vs.
Washington Sfafe, 3 p.m.,
Maples Pavilion

However, in that period the
team never won an outright Pacific
10 Conference title, nor did it ad
vance past the second round of the
NCAA tournament. While the se
niors have been successful, they are
now entering their last chance to
accomplish all of their goals.
"I'm really excited," said guard
Yamasaki. "Everyone's going to be
there, everyone stands and cheers
and talks about all you've accom
plished. But to me, 1 haven't ac
complished all 1 want to yet and 1
still have a chance to do that."
Tonight the team has the oppor
tunity to accomplish the first goal:
an outright regular season Pac-1()
championship. A win over Wash
ington would expand the No. 2 (>ar

dinal's lead over the I luskies to four
games with only three left to play.
For the first time in Pac-10 his
tory, the regular-season confer
ence winner will not get an auto
matic bid into the NCAA tourna
ment. That bid, and the official
Pac-10 championship, will be de
termined in the conference tour
nament that will be held in Eugene,
Ore. Nevertheless, a win tonight
will seal the No. 1 seed in the tour
nament for the Cardinal (24-1, 14-
0 Pac-10).
This year's senior class has been
a crucial part of the team's success.
Yamasaki has been an offensive
force and leads the team in scoring
with 16.6 points per contest.
Donaphin, the other senior
starter, gives the Cardinal a strong
inside presence with her excellent
post play.
Even though the other three se
niors have gotten less playing time,
their importance to tlie team has
been evident in ways that aren't ap
