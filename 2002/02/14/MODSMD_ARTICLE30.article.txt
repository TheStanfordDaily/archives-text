# Seniors to close out run
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
After four years of toil, sweat,
heartbreak and joy, the five seniors
on the women's basketball team
have reached the end of their tour
year journey. Come Sunday, there
will be no more Brickyard Club, no
more of Maples' bouncing floor, no
more "All Right Now" emanating
from the Band.
The next time Bethany
Donaphin, Cori Enghusen, Enjoli
Izidor, Lauren St. Clair and Lind
sey Yamasaki watch a regular sea
son game at Maples Pavilion, it will
be as spectators, rather than partic
ipants — though they may still have
a couple games t here left. Given the
Cardinal's outstanding record, a
first round game in the NCAA tour
nament at Maples as a No. 1
through No. 4 seed is highly likely.
In their four years on the court,
the seniors have played over 100
games, with the Cardinal enjoying
a .713 winning percentage during
that time.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Today: No. 2 Sfanford vs.
Washington, 7 p.m., Maples
Pavilion
Saturday: No. 2 Sfanford vs.
Washington Sfafe, 3 p.m.,
Maples Pavilion

However, in that period the
team never won an outright Pacific
10 Conference title, nor did it ad
vance past the second round of the
NCAA tournament. While the se
niors have been successful, they are
now entering their last chance to
accomplish all of their goals.
"I'm really excited," said guard
Yamasaki. "Everyone's going to be
there, everyone stands and cheers
and talks about all you've accom
plished. But to me, 1 haven't ac
complished all 1 want to yet and 1
still have a chance to do that."
Tonight the team has the oppor
tunity to accomplish the first goal:
an outright regular season Pac-1()
championship. A win over Wash
ington would expand the No. 2 (>ar

dinal's lead over the I luskies to four
games with only three left to play.
For the first time in Pac-10 his
tory, the regular-season confer
ence winner will not get an auto
matic bid into the NCAA tourna
ment. That bid, and the official
Pac-10 championship, will be de
termined in the conference tour
nament that will be held in Eugene,
Ore. Nevertheless, a win tonight
will seal the No. 1 seed in the tour
nament for the Cardinal (24-1, 14-
0 Pac-10).
This year's senior class has been
a crucial part of the team's success.
Yamasaki has been an offensive
force and leads the team in scoring
with 16.6 points per contest.
Donaphin, the other senior
starter, gives the Cardinal a strong
inside presence with her excellent
post play.
Even though the other three se
niors have gotten less playing time,
their importance to tlie team has
been evident in ways that aren't ap
parent in the box score. /\ll three
have started at least one game this
season and have also come off the
bench to give the team much-need
ed energy and leadership. Izidor
and St. Clair have played multiple
positions, while Enghusen has
come on strong toward the end of
(he season to bolster the team's in
side game.
While the team needs only one
win in its next four games to cap
ture the title, it can't take the Wash
ington schools for granted. Last
month's 75-67 victory over the
Huskies was one of the closest
games of the year for the Cardinal.
At one point, Stanford led by as
many as 14, but Washington hung
around until the end.
Washington (15-8, 10-4) is led
by the play of forward Loree
Payne, who averages 14.2 points
per game. The Huskies have won
live straight games since facing the
Cardinal, taking over second place
in the conference with a win over
Arizona State last weekend.
"We haven't swept Washington

in several years," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. " They have
some very talented players and
they are especially offensively
skilled — they are excellent shoot
ers and passers."
For the Cardinal, sophomore
Nicole Powell is coming off of her
fourth Pac-10 Player of the Week
award and is continuing her
record-setting season. She has also
been named as one of 20 finalists
for the Naismith Player of the'
Year award.
Paired with Yamasaki, the two
have been unstoppable in Confer
ence play, and hope to continue
their dominance over t he weekend
against the Washington schools.
"[Washington] plays a really
good team game," VanDerveer
said. "They want what we have.
We're in first place and they're in
second. I expect a great game: this is
a tournament game against a tour
nament-caliber team."
Yamasaki, for one, will try to
keep a level head as she takes the
Maples floor for the last time.
"I keep telling myself that it's
not going to be an emotional thing
because there's a lot more of the
season to go," she said. "1 feel like
it's not over."

good team game," VanDerveer
said. "They want what we have.
We're in first place and they're in
second. I expect a great game: this is
a tournament game against a tour
nament-caliber team."
Yamasaki, for one, will try to
keep a level head as she takes the
Maples floor for the last time.
"I keep telling myself that it's
not going to be an emotional thing
because there's a lot more of the
season to go," she said. "1 feel like
it's not over."
After four years of toil, sweat,
heartbreak and joy, the five seniors
on the women's basketball team
have reached the end of their tour
year journey. Come Sunday, there
will be no more Brickyard Club, no
more of Maples' bouncing floor, no
more "All Right Now" emanating
from the Band.
The next time Bethany
Donaphin, Cori Enghusen, Enjoli
Izidor, Lauren St. Clair and Lind
sey Yamasaki watch a regular sea
son game at Maples Pavilion, it will
be as spectators, rather than partic
ipants — though they may still have
a couple games t here left. Given the
Cardinal's outstanding record, a
first round game in the NCAA tour
nament at Maples as a No. 1
through No. 4 seed is highly likely.
In their four years on the court,
the seniors have played over 100
games, with the Cardinal enjoying
a .713 winning percentage during
that time.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Today: No. 2 Sfanford vs.
Washington, 7 p.m., Maples
Pavilion
Saturday: No. 2 Sfanford vs.
Washington Sfafe, 3 p.m.,
Maples Pavilion

However, in that period the
team never won an outright Pacific
10 Conference title, nor did it ad
vance past the second round of the
NCAA tournament. While the se
niors have been successful, they are
now entering their last chance to
accomplish all of their goals.
"I'm really excited," said guard
Yamasaki. "Everyone's going to be
there, everyone stands and cheers
and talks about all you've accom
plished. But to me, 1 haven't ac
complished all 1 want to yet and 1
still have a chance to do that."
Tonight the team has the oppor
tunity to accomplish the first goal:
an outright regular season Pac-1()
championship. A win over Wash
ington would expand the No. 2 (>ar

dinal's lead over the I luskies to four
games with only three left to play.
For the first time in Pac-10 his
tory, the regular-season confer
ence winner will not get an auto
matic bid into the NCAA tourna
ment. That bid, and the official
Pac-10 championship, will be de
termined in the conference tour
nament that will be held in Eugene,
Ore. Nevertheless, a win tonight
will seal the No. 1 seed in the tour
nament for the Cardinal (24-1, 14-
0 Pac-10).
This year's senior class has been
a crucial part of the team's success.
Yamasaki has been an offensive
force and leads the team in scoring
with 16.6 points per contest.
Donaphin, the other senior
starter, gives the Cardinal a strong
inside presence with her excellent
post play.
Even though the other three se
niors have gotten less playing time,
their importance to tlie team has
been evident in ways that aren't ap
parent in the box score. /\ll three
have started at least one game this
season and have also come off the
bench to give the team much-need
ed energy and leadership. Izidor
and St. Clair have played multiple
positions, while Enghusen has
come on strong toward the end of
(he season to bolster the team's in
side game.
While the team needs only one
win in its next four games to cap
ture the title, it can't take the Wash
ington schools for granted. Last
month's 75-67 victory over the
Huskies was one of the closest
games of the year for the Cardinal.
At one point, Stanford led by as
many as 14, but Washington hung
around until the end.
Washington (15-8, 10-4) is led
by the play of forward Loree
Payne, who averages 14.2 points
per game. The Huskies have won
live straight games since facing the
Cardinal, taking over second place
in the conference with a win over
Arizona State last weekend.
"We haven't swept Washington

in several years," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. " They have
some very talented players and
they are especially offensively
skilled — they are excellent shoot
ers and passers."
For the Cardinal, sophomore
Nicole Powell is coming off of her
fourth Pac-10 Player of the Week
award and is continuing her
record-setting season. She has also
been named as one of 20 finalists
for the Naismith Player of the'
Year award.
Paired with Yamasaki, the two
have been unstoppable in Confer
ence play, and hope to continue
their dominance over t he weekend
against the Washington schools.
