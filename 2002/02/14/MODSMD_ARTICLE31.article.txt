# Men's ballers roll into UW

### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Washington schools have
already done plenty for the Cardi
nal this season.
It doesn't seem like too long ago
when the both the Huskies (8-11,2-
11 Pacific 10 Conference) and the
Cougars (5-16, 1-12) came to town
and reminded us all what Stanford
was really capable of. Both teams
happened to be on the receiving
end of Cardinal blowouts at Maples
Pavilion, with Washington falling
105-60 and Washington State suc
cumbing 83-50.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Today: No. 12 Stanford vs.
Washington, 7 p.m., Bank of
America Arena, Seattle, WA
Saturday: No. 12 Stanford vs.
Washington State, 3 p.m., Friel
Court, Pullman, WA

But really and perhaps more im
portantly, the Washington schools
changed our thinking —they re
minded Stanford fans that the Car
dinal could still be the dominating
team that it has been in years past.
The two wins gave a downtrod
den Stanford (15-6, 8-4) squad the
confidence to swagger into Pauley
Pavilion and steal a victory from
then-No. 13 UCLA.
So the scariest part about walk
ing into Friel Court and Bank of
America Arena is the fact that the
Cardinal men certainly don't
have anything left to prove to
their opponents.
The question hangs in the air —
how will the Cardinal react to being
the heavy favorite this weekend?
In spite its recent successes, Stan
ford is very aware of the impor
tance of this road trip. If anything
the Cardinal has remained humble
throughout the year, knowing that
from the beginning that this season
would be a struggle.
"This is a big weekend," said
sophomore guard Matt Lottie h.
"Two wins would be nice, especial
ly because they're on the road and

road vic tories arc so hard to come
by in this conference." .
Away from home, the road has
proved troublesome for all of the
Pac-lO teams this year. Out of the
four conference losses that Stan
ford, UCLA and USC have each ac
cumulated this season, three have
come on the road. And all four of

Oregon's conference failures have
come outside of the friendly con
fines of McArthur Court. .
"I don't know what to expect re
ally," said freshman center Rob Lit
tle. "This is my first time going to
Washington in my entire life. 1 his is
