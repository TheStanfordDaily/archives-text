# Men's ballers roll into UW

### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Washington schools have
already done plenty for the Cardi
nal this season.
It doesn't seem like too long ago
when the both the Huskies (8-11,2-
11 Pacific 10 Conference) and the
Cougars (5-16, 1-12) came to town
and reminded us all what Stanford
was really capable of. Both teams
happened to be on the receiving
end of Cardinal blowouts at Maples
Pavilion, with Washington falling
105-60 and Washington State suc
cumbing 83-50.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Today: No. 12 Stanford vs.
Washington, 7 p.m., Bank of
America Arena, Seattle, WA
Saturday: No. 12 Stanford vs.
Washington State, 3 p.m., Friel
Court, Pullman, WA

But really and perhaps more im
portantly, the Washington schools
changed our thinking —they re
minded Stanford fans that the Car
dinal could still be the dominating
team that it has been in years past.
The two wins gave a downtrod
den Stanford (15-6, 8-4) squad the
confidence to swagger into Pauley
Pavilion and steal a victory from
then-No. 13 UCLA.
So the scariest part about walk
ing into Friel Court and Bank of
America Arena is the fact that the
Cardinal men certainly don't
have anything left to prove to
their opponents.
The question hangs in the air —
how will the Cardinal react to being
the heavy favorite this weekend?
In spite its recent successes, Stan
ford is very aware of the impor
tance of this road trip. If anything
the Cardinal has remained humble
throughout the year, knowing that
from the beginning that this season
would be a struggle.
"This is a big weekend," said
sophomore guard Matt Lottie h.
"Two wins would be nice, especial
ly because they're on the road and

road vic tories arc so hard to come
by in this conference." .
Away from home, the road has
proved troublesome for all of the
Pac-lO teams this year. Out of the
four conference losses that Stan
ford, UCLA and USC have each ac
cumulated this season, three have
come on the road. And all four of

Oregon's conference failures have
come outside of the friendly con
fines of McArthur Court. .
"I don't know what to expect re
ally," said freshman center Rob Lit
tle. "This is my first time going to
Washington in my entire life. 1 his is

just two more important games
that we have to win."
Preparing mentally for these
two games surely won't be easy,
considering the woeful records of
the opponents. The trip to Wash
ington should be one of the easiest
two-game series that the Cardinal
has had thus far (second only to the
two-game home series against the
Huskies and Cougars played previ
ously this year at Maples).
"Subconsciously you feel like
you've beaten a team once so you
think you're better and should be
able to do it again," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "But you just
have to point out the importance of
getting the wins and hopefully your
kids are mature enough to follow
up on that. Seventh place in the
conference is not that far from third

or fourth, so you have to be ready to
play eveiy night."
II everything goes as planned
Stanford's starters should get a
much-needed and deserved rest
this weekend after battling (hrough
four extremely emotionally and
physically taxing games in a row.
However, it is imperative that
the Cardinal play well from the
start. Stanford can't afford to get
behind early in front *a hostile
crowd — and more importantly, it
can't afford to lose.
Who knows if the Cardinal can
take another one of those down-to
the-final second games, when
Murphy's Law and luck have a
stronger impact on the final out
come than talent.
"A loss this weekend would be
devastating," said sophomore for
ward Teyo Johnson.
There's no time left to slack off.
Things are coming down to the
wire.
It's coming close to finals week

and the Cardinal still has a little
time left to cram. They can still pull
this thing off with the right amount
of effort.
But this come-from-behind
resurgence is not going to be easy.
Not only does the Cardinal have to
brave the idea of potential upsets in
Washington, it also has a rough
schedule ahead, which includes a
trip down to Arizona and a visit
from UCLA and USC next week.
If players and spectators have
learned anything from this tumul
tuous Pac-10 season thus far, it's
that no win is guaranteed and that
the only thing that can be expected
is utter chaos.
"Coach Montgomery is really
good about not underestimating a
team," Little said. "I Ie prepares us
the same way for Washington that
he does'for Arizona and LCIA. He
takes every game seriously. It
would really look bad if we went up
there and didn't play our best and
came up short."
