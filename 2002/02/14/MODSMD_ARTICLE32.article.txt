Editor's Note: This is part two of The Dailyls iri
terview with Stanford's new head football roach,
Buddy Teevens.

Daily: The offense will probably play a big
part in this, but how are you looking to in

crease fan support and increase ticket sales
to games?
Teevens: I'm new enough here that I
don't know the whole environment yet. I
just think that the whole image of what
we're doing is something that people have
some fun with. They can come to the
game, we'll play a colorful brand of foot
ball, there are some unexpected things
that will happen and hopefully those as
pects will translate into additional people
in the seats.
Daily: How are you going to make your
presence felt to students on campus?

Teevens: I'd love to just get out and meet
with different student groups. I'm not
aware enough of the housing situations,
t he dormitories, the fraternities, sororities
or just different academic groups. But I
went through a very similar experience as
an undergraduate. I'd love to have a
chance just to get a pulse of the institution
and to present some of the things that
we're doing.
So, just to get a chance to go out and get
to know people and hopefully they can get
a chance to know me. I'd like to do a good
hifeof that.
Daily: Your whole career has been

spent east of the Mississippi. When you de
cided to come out here, was that attractive
to you, a change of scenery?
T eevens: I appreciate that there's a
strong West Coast contingent here
and we need to continue that. But, I
also wanted to go out and have some
guys with East Coast experience,
Southern experience. Midwest expe
rience and I think we were able to do
that successfully.
Daily: Have you had a chance to study
any Stanford football history, study any of
the famous plays $

Teevens: I've been on the road fora long
time. This is really (lie first time I've been
off the road and then the weekends have
been spent recruiting. 1 have a couple of
books that some alums have sent along,
which I appreciate just to study and learn
about the game and the history here and
certainly the rivalries in the Pac-1(). I was a
historian by education and 1 certainly ap
preciate the history of Stanford University
and the football program.
Daily: Any games you're particularly
looking forward to next year? Notre Dame?
