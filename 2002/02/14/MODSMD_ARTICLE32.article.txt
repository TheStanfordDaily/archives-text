# Teevens opens up about student involvement, offense
## "We'll play a colorful brand of ball.. .some unexpected things will happen" 
### JONATHAN STULL MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
Editor's Note: This is part two of The Dailyls iri
terview with Stanford's new head football roach,
Buddy Teevens.

Daily: The offense will probably play a big
part in this, but how are you looking to in

crease fan support and increase ticket sales
to games?
Teevens: I'm new enough here that I
don't know the whole environment yet. I
just think that the whole image of what
we're doing is something that people have
some fun with. They can come to the
game, we'll play a colorful brand of foot
ball, there are some unexpected things
that will happen and hopefully those as
pects will translate into additional people
in the seats.
Daily: How are you going to make your
presence felt to students on campus?

Teevens: I'd love to just get out and meet
with different student groups. I'm not
aware enough of the housing situations,
t he dormitories, the fraternities, sororities
or just different academic groups. But I
went through a very similar experience as
an undergraduate. I'd love to have a
chance just to get a pulse of the institution
and to present some of the things that
we're doing.
So, just to get a chance to go out and get
to know people and hopefully they can get
a chance to know me. I'd like to do a good
hifeof that.
Daily: Your whole career has been

spent east of the Mississippi. When you de
cided to come out here, was that attractive
to you, a change of scenery?
T eevens: I appreciate that there's a
strong West Coast contingent here
and we need to continue that. But, I
also wanted to go out and have some
guys with East Coast experience,
Southern experience. Midwest expe
rience and I think we were able to do
that successfully.
Daily: Have you had a chance to study
any Stanford football history, study any of
the famous plays $

Teevens: I've been on the road fora long
time. This is really (lie first time I've been
off the road and then the weekends have
been spent recruiting. 1 have a couple of
books that some alums have sent along,
which I appreciate just to study and learn
about the game and the history here and
certainly the rivalries in the Pac-1(). I was a
historian by education and 1 certainly ap
preciate the history of Stanford University
and the football program.
Daily: Any games you're particularly
looking forward to next year? Notre Dame?
feevens: At this point, they're
all important. No individual focus
on any game. The game in Boston
is in my backyard, Boston College,
and I have a lot of friends out there.
And it's the opener. But, that's the
neat thing, each week is;i new chal
lenge and a different opportunity.
Daily: The pressure on the Stan
ford team isn V as great as Florida,
where there's a pack of people cov
ering the game. Was that attractive
as well?
Teevens: I think it's a healthy
perspective. There are other
things in the institution besides the
athletic programs. From an athlet
ic standpoint, there's such diversi
ty, there are a lot of people who
excel in a lot of different things
here. That attention is focused in a
lot of different areas. At other
schools, the main focus, the sole
focus, is football.
Daily: How much will you try to
tailor the offense to the personnel
you presently have in place?
Teevens: You come in with an
idea of what you'd like to do and
then you tweak it based on what
the talent allows you to do. But,
from what I have seen, Teyo John
son, Luke Powell, Chris Lewis,
Kerry Carter, there are a lot of ca
pabilities there. We graduated a
good number of people and some
very talented players but there are
some guys in the fold who will
need to step up and carry it for
ward. And I think the recruiting
class will help in that regard, too.
Daily: Coach Willingham almost
always redshirted his freshmen.
Will you let players play right when
they come in?
Teevens: As I've told the team,
I really believe the best players

should play. I told the incoming
recruits, prepare yourself to com
pete in the fall. If you tell a guy
he's going to redshirt right off the
bat, as a competitor it's very diffi
cult to compete, compete, com
pete and then all of a sudden [be
told], work hard, but don't play.
I'd rather have guys push, which
eliminates any complacency or a
sense that, hey, it's my turn to
play. There's a sense of urgency
across the board that if I'm best
prepared, I'll,get on the field.
Daily: Can you briefly take us
through the process of creating your
playbook?
Teevens: Right now, the
biggest thing is merging lan
guages. We have Greek, Italian,
Chinese and we are trying to put
it all together. With a new staff
like this, you can really take the
best ideas from a lot of places.
What we are really doing is
merging terminology. Some of
the plays are similar, some of the
thoughts I have will be different
than things they've seen before.
Ideally, we'd like to take the best
of all, incorporate it and make it
uniquely Stanford's offense.
Daily: Are you going to be calling
plays or are you just going to be
overseeing the offense?
Teevens: I'd like to stay inte
grally involved with the offense,
but I've hired an offensive coor
dinator and a defensive guy. I
think in a program like this you
need to have a wide vision of
what's happening. There's an
awful lot going on.
I'll have the ability to call the
plays at any point if I feel like that's
what we need to do. Hut, I think if
you hire good people, let them
work and let them go and just
monitor when it's all headed.
Daily: How important is it for
you to get out into the community?
Teevens: In general, I'd really
just like to meet as many people as

1 can and get a sense of this place.
Now that I'm back here, my fami
ly's not here, I'm staying at a
hotel, send me an invite and I'll
come to dinner.
That'll help me in terms of
what we're doing from a football
standpoint with the players, with
the faculty, with the alums, that
sort of thing.
I must say, the faculty has been

tremendously supportive, espe
cially in the recruiting process. It's
somewhat unique to see how
strongly they feel about their area
of study, their expertise, yet how
proud they are of the accomplish
ments of the student athletes on
campus.
As one of them said, we expect
to excel in everything. And, I
think you can do that at Stanford.

schools, the main focus, the sole
focus, is football.
Daily: How much will you try to
tailor the offense to the personnel
you presently have in place?
Teevens: You come in with an
idea of what you'd like to do and
then you tweak it based on what
the talent allows you to do. But,
from what I have seen, Teyo John
son, Luke Powell, Chris Lewis,
Kerry Carter, there are a lot of ca
pabilities there. We graduated a
good number of people and some
very talented players but there are
some guys in the fold who will
need to step up and carry it for
ward. And I think the recruiting
class will help in that regard, too.
Daily: Coach Willingham almost
always redshirted his freshmen.
Will you let players play right when
they come in?
Teevens: As I've told the team,
I really believe the best players

should play. I told the incoming
recruits, prepare yourself to com
pete in the fall. If you tell a guy
he's going to redshirt right off the
bat, as a competitor it's very diffi
cult to compete, compete, com
pete and then all of a sudden [be
told], work hard, but don't play.
I'd rather have guys push, which
eliminates any complacency or a
sense that, hey, it's my turn to
play. There's a sense of urgency
across the board that if I'm best
prepared, I'll,get on the field.
Daily: Can you briefly take us
through the process of creating your
playbook?
Teevens: Right now, the
biggest thing is merging lan
guages. We have Greek, Italian,
Chinese and we are trying to put
it all together. With a new staff
like this, you can really take the
best ideas from a lot of places.
What we are really doing is
merging terminology. Some of
the plays are similar, some of the
thoughts I have will be different
than things they've seen before.
Ideally, we'd like to take the best
of all, incorporate it and make it
uniquely Stanford's offense.
Daily: Are you going to be calling
plays or are you just going to be
overseeing the offense?
Teevens: I'd like to stay inte
grally involved with the offense,
but I've hired an offensive coor
dinator and a defensive guy. I
think in a program like this you
need to have a wide vision of
what's happening. There's an
awful lot going on.
I'll have the ability to call the
plays at any point if I feel like that's
what we need to do. Hut, I think if
you hire good people, let them
work and let them go and just
monitor when it's all headed.
Daily: How important is it for
you to get out into the community?
Teevens: In general, I'd really
just like to meet as many people as

1 can and get a sense of this place.
Now that I'm back here, my fami
ly's not here, I'm staying at a
hotel, send me an invite and I'll
come to dinner.
That'll help me in terms of
what we're doing from a football
standpoint with the players, with
the faculty, with the alums, that
sort of thing.
I must say, the faculty has been

tremendously supportive, espe
cially in the recruiting process. It's
somewhat unique to see how
strongly they feel about their area
of study, their expertise, yet how
proud they are of the accomplish
ments of the student athletes on
campus.
As one of them said, we expect
to excel in everything. And, I
think you can do that at Stanford.
Editor's Note: This is part two of The Dailyls iri
terview with Stanford's new head football roach,
Buddy Teevens.

Daily: The offense will probably play a big
part in this, but how are you looking to in

crease fan support and increase ticket sales
to games?
Teevens: I'm new enough here that I
don't know the whole environment yet. I
just think that the whole image of what
we're doing is something that people have
some fun with. They can come to the
game, we'll play a colorful brand of foot
ball, there are some unexpected things
that will happen and hopefully those as
pects will translate into additional people
in the seats.
Daily: How are you going to make your
presence felt to students on campus?

Teevens: I'd love to just get out and meet
with different student groups. I'm not
aware enough of the housing situations,
t he dormitories, the fraternities, sororities
or just different academic groups. But I
went through a very similar experience as
an undergraduate. I'd love to have a
chance just to get a pulse of the institution
and to present some of the things that
we're doing.
So, just to get a chance to go out and get
to know people and hopefully they can get
a chance to know me. I'd like to do a good
hifeof that.
Daily: Your whole career has been

spent east of the Mississippi. When you de
cided to come out here, was that attractive
to you, a change of scenery?
T eevens: I appreciate that there's a
strong West Coast contingent here
and we need to continue that. But, I
also wanted to go out and have some
guys with East Coast experience,
Southern experience. Midwest expe
rience and I think we were able to do
that successfully.
Daily: Have you had a chance to study
any Stanford football history, study any of
the famous plays $

Teevens: I've been on the road fora long
time. This is really (lie first time I've been
off the road and then the weekends have
been spent recruiting. 1 have a couple of
books that some alums have sent along,
which I appreciate just to study and learn
about the game and the history here and
certainly the rivalries in the Pac-1(). I was a
historian by education and 1 certainly ap
preciate the history of Stanford University
and the football program.
Daily: Any games you're particularly
looking forward to next year? Notre Dame?
feevens: At this point, they're
all important. No individual focus
on any game. The game in Boston
is in my backyard, Boston College,
and I have a lot of friends out there.
And it's the opener. But, that's the
neat thing, each week is;i new chal
lenge and a different opportunity.
Daily: The pressure on the Stan
ford team isn V as great as Florida,
where there's a pack of people cov
ering the game. Was that attractive
as well?
Teevens: I think it's a healthy
perspective. There are other
things in the institution besides the
athletic programs. From an athlet
ic standpoint, there's such diversi
ty, there are a lot of people who
excel in a lot of different things
here. That attention is focused in a
lot of different areas. At other
schools, the main focus, the sole
focus, is football.
