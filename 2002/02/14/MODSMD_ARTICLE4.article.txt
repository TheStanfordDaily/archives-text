# Valentine's Day options do exist, even at Stanford
## 
### RACHEL SYME 
For many Stanford students, the
idea of Valentine's Day is menac
ing. Valentine's Day for them is no
longer a day celebrating paper bags
filled with chalky candy hearts, but
a day meant to emphasize love â€”
and those who don't have it.
"Valentine's Day is a completely
commercial holiday, but it has be
come emotional," lamented fresh
man J illian Griffin. "Many people
find themselves lonely on Valen
tine's Day, when really it is the same
as any other day of the year."
Other students, such as junior
Tom Whitnah, take a more opti
mistic point of view.
"I've been single on every
Valentine's Day since sophomore
year of high school, but I couldn't
help loving the 'Love Day' even if
every other single person hated it."
Whitnah said.
Although students take oppos
ing views on the nature of the holi
day, most agree that Valentine's
Day at Stanford is a less-than
thrilling affair. With so many other
"University holidays," such as Big
Game and Founder's Day, Stan
ford seems to have forgotten
Valentine's Day.
While visiting a friend at

Brigham Young University on
Valentine's Day, senior Shad
Ahmed was "stunned to see their
bookstore decorated with red and
pink everywhere."
"Our bookstore had a 'Valen
tine's Day Table'that year," Ahmed
said. "You can tell our campus is
not too excited for the day."
Many events around campus
seem to echo this sentiment, like
"Girl's Night Only" parties and
Mixed Company's annual "Love
Sucks" a cappella concert, a satirical
tribute to t he trials and tribulations
of finding love at Stanford.
Although many students dismiss
the perception that Stanford dating
is a myth, this fear could be the dri
ving force behind Stanford stu
dents' apathy to the day of love. If
students are not dating, why should
they buy into a commercial holiday
that celebrates couples?
For the lucky few involved in a
relationship today, however, the
campus is not devoid of opportuni
ties fora romantic time. Many stu
dent groups are taking advantage
of the commercialism and sappy
sentiments of the day, selling gifts
such as serenades and balloon bou
quets to the smitten.
