# Valentine's Day options do exist, even at Stanford
## 
### RACHEL SYME 
For many Stanford students, the
idea of Valentine's Day is menac
ing. Valentine's Day for them is no
longer a day celebrating paper bags
filled with chalky candy hearts, but
a day meant to emphasize love â€”
and those who don't have it.
"Valentine's Day is a completely
commercial holiday, but it has be
come emotional," lamented fresh
man J illian Griffin. "Many people
find themselves lonely on Valen
tine's Day, when really it is the same
as any other day of the year."
Other students, such as junior
Tom Whitnah, take a more opti
mistic point of view.
"I've been single on every
Valentine's Day since sophomore
year of high school, but I couldn't
help loving the 'Love Day' even if
every other single person hated it."
Whitnah said.
Although students take oppos
ing views on the nature of the holi
day, most agree that Valentine's
Day at Stanford is a less-than
thrilling affair. With so many other
"University holidays," such as Big
Game and Founder's Day, Stan
ford seems to have forgotten
Valentine's Day.
While visiting a friend at

Brigham Young University on
Valentine's Day, senior Shad
Ahmed was "stunned to see their
bookstore decorated with red and
pink everywhere."
"Our bookstore had a 'Valen
tine's Day Table'that year," Ahmed
said. "You can tell our campus is
not too excited for the day."
Many events around campus
seem to echo this sentiment, like
"Girl's Night Only" parties and
Mixed Company's annual "Love
Sucks" a cappella concert, a satirical
tribute to t he trials and tribulations
of finding love at Stanford.
Although many students dismiss
the perception that Stanford dating
is a myth, this fear could be the dri
ving force behind Stanford stu
dents' apathy to the day of love. If
students are not dating, why should
they buy into a commercial holiday
that celebrates couples?
For the lucky few involved in a
relationship today, however, the
campus is not devoid of opportuni
ties fora romantic time. Many stu
dent groups are taking advantage
of the commercialism and sappy
sentiments of the day, selling gifts
such as serenades and balloon bou
quets to the smitten.

Sale in search of sweets for his sweetheart.
Although some a cappella
groups, such as Mixed Company,
take an ironic l<x)k at Valentine's
Day, the Stanford Mendicants see
the holiday as an opportunity.
They use love songs, roses and a
heaping spoonful of boyish charm
and tucked-in jerseys to w<x> girls

across campus.
The Alpha Kappa Delta Phi
sorority takes a different approach,
selling balloons and candy to the
love-struck in order to raise money
for the Susan G. Komen Breast
Cancer Foundation.
While student organizations
help to supply gilts, the campus it
self can be a romantic spot to take
a Valentine's Day stroll. Accord
ing to some freshmen and sopho
mores, it contains many romantic

locations. Among the most popu
lar are Lake Lagunita at sunset,
the benches by Memorial (-liurch,
the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the
Lane History Corner balcony,
and the south mezzanine of
Green Library.
For i hose who prefer Palo Alto as
their Valentine's Day destination,
there are many restaurants that can
provide an intimate and romantic
setting, complete with candles,
mood music and, of course, menus

in foreign languages. Many stu
dents suggested Osteria and
Noveau Trattoria, while others pre
ferred Max's Opera Cafe and Trad
er Vic's. For students on a budget,
Lakeside Dining should have an ex
cellent selection today.
The students who are still unat
tached by "Love Day" should not
fear, however. They do not have to
rely on their "Screw Your Room
mate" dates or that cute guy or girl
in their bioethics lecture to have a

good time today. Many dorms are
taking matters into t heir own hands,
creating traditions that allow the
clay to seem less disheartening to
single students.
In many freshman dorms, males
gather in the middle of the night to
parade around the dorm in a pack,
waking each girl with a loud pound
ing on her door and a red rose, fi
nally bringing them to a lounge full
of breakfast food and Valentine's
Day candv.

Although Stanford may not
have any established traditions for
the clay, students seem to be pre
vailing over Valentine's gloom by
creating their own customs and
bonding together. So, if you find
yourself without a date (or a Men
dicant) today, find a group of
friends and watch old movies, ser
enade random people on your
hall, buy a do/en roses for yourself,
or simply go outside and enjoy the
beautiful weather.
