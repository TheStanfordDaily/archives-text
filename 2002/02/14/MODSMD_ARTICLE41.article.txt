# Kyle Logan fights his way through injuries
## Snake bitten.. .again AND AGAIN 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the past four years, Kyle Logan has paid his
dues and has waited for his time to come.
But the senior guard's career has been marred by
injuries: one, after the other, after the other, after the
other.
"He's probably had the toughest string of hard luck
that 1 have ever seen," said fellow senior Tony Giovac
chini. "It just seems like every time lie's about to turn
the corner, something else happens."
You could say that again.
Freshman year, Logan's ankle needed surgery, and
sophomore year, his shoulder needed the same.
Junior year, his knee gave out on him.
And this year, Logan's senior season, when it final
ly looked like he would escape injury-free, he was side
lined with a stress fracture in his shin.
"He's injured just about every part of his body,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. "It's been a
tough deal for him. He's an emotional kid and I think
he's had a rough time of it."
Safe to say, good luck is not Logan's corner. The
Hagerstown, Md., native has certainly experienced
worse fortune than anyone could have ever imagined.
Yet, while Montgomery and the coaches sympa
thize with Logan, he doesn't want to hear it.
And while the players pity the hard breaks and tough
luck the senior has endured, Logan won't feel sorry for
himself.
Rather, he's taken the higher ground by reflecting on
the brighter side of his life.
"Sure, it's been pretty bad. But then again, if you
take a step back and look at your surroundings, you
kind of realize how fortunate [you are] just to be here.
It has to put things in perspective," said Logan.
It is this sort of attitude that has kept Logan com
ing to workouts and practices day after day. He still
arrives at Maples Pavilion with his chin up, a grin on
his face and an urge to compete. Hurt or not, he still
suits up in his practice jersey and awaits the day's
proceedings.
If his injuries won't let him to run, lie shoots
around on the sidelines. If his injuries won't allow

him to play, he watches or rides the stationary bike
instead. ,
So, although the final weeks of Stanford's season
approach, Logan still gives it his all. And although
there is little chance he'll ever see significant playing
time if he returns this season, he still strives to do the
best he possibly can.
"He's just trying to get to the point where he's
healthy again," Giovacchini said. "It's got to be so hard
to stay motivated. That's a real tribute to his personal
ity and his character to be able to stick it out."
It's not to say that he's been a lightweight in practice
either. When Logan has been healthy, he has given his
teammates fits.
"He competes hard and he's one of our toughest
practice players," said junior center Curtis Borchardt.
"I can attest to that because he goes over my back for
rebounds all the time."
Borchardt surely has some idea of Logan's plight,
since he's been sidelined two straight seasons by a
stress fracture in his right foot.
"You've just got to be really patient. Jason Collins
and I and anyone who has gone through a series of in
juries like that really do feel for him," Borchardt said.
"He never quits, which is not an easy thing to do if
you're not seeing a lot of rewards for your hard work."
Despite the fact that he still has one more year of el
igibility, Logan doesn't think he'll be back for another
season.
And although he has not reaped many rewards
from his time on the court (37 points in 1 14 min
utes), the reward for his hard work in the classroom
will be the largest of all. A year from June, lie will
graduate with a degree in Management Science and
Engineering, and lie has .hopes of attaining a mas
ter's in business.
Logan will also be with his team next week on Se
nior Day at Maples Pavilion, and whether he'll be in
uniform or street clothes really won't be important.
What will be important is that he will deserve just as
many accolades and applause as every other senior who
lias gone through the basketball program in the past.
And he'll deserve it for those two simple reasons:
He has paid his dues. And he has waited for his time to
come.

Kyle Logan has remained upbeat despite a rash of bad luck that has left the senior guard/forward fight
ing injuries for most of his four years on the Farm.
For the past four years, Kyle Logan has paid his
dues and has waited for his time to come.
But the senior guard's career has been marred by
injuries: one, after the other, after the other, after the
other.
"He's probably had the toughest string of hard luck
that 1 have ever seen," said fellow senior Tony Giovac
chini. "It just seems like every time lie's about to turn
the corner, something else happens."
You could say that again.
Freshman year, Logan's ankle needed surgery, and
sophomore year, his shoulder needed the same.
Junior year, his knee gave out on him.
And this year, Logan's senior season, when it final
ly looked like he would escape injury-free, he was side
lined with a stress fracture in his shin.
"He's injured just about every part of his body,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. "It's been a
tough deal for him. He's an emotional kid and I think
he's had a rough time of it."
Safe to say, good luck is not Logan's corner. The
Hagerstown, Md., native has certainly experienced
worse fortune than anyone could have ever imagined.
Yet, while Montgomery and the coaches sympa
thize with Logan, he doesn't want to hear it.
And while the players pity the hard breaks and tough
luck the senior has endured, Logan won't feel sorry for
himself.
Rather, he's taken the higher ground by reflecting on
the brighter side of his life.
"Sure, it's been pretty bad. But then again, if you
take a step back and look at your surroundings, you
kind of realize how fortunate [you are] just to be here.
It has to put things in perspective," said Logan.
It is this sort of attitude that has kept Logan com
ing to workouts and practices day after day. He still
arrives at Maples Pavilion with his chin up, a grin on
his face and an urge to compete. Hurt or not, he still
suits up in his practice jersey and awaits the day's
proceedings.
If his injuries won't let him to run, lie shoots
around on the sidelines. If his injuries won't allow

him to play, he watches or rides the stationary bike
instead. ,
So, although the final weeks of Stanford's season
approach, Logan still gives it his all. And although
there is little chance he'll ever see significant playing
time if he returns this season, he still strives to do the
best he possibly can.
"He's just trying to get to the point where he's
healthy again," Giovacchini said. "It's got to be so hard
to stay motivated. That's a real tribute to his personal
ity and his character to be able to stick it out."
It's not to say that he's been a lightweight in practice
either. When Logan has been healthy, he has given his
teammates fits.
"He competes hard and he's one of our toughest
practice players," said junior center Curtis Borchardt.
"I can attest to that because he goes over my back for
rebounds all the time."
Borchardt surely has some idea of Logan's plight,
since he's been sidelined two straight seasons by a
stress fracture in his right foot.
"You've just got to be really patient. Jason Collins
and I and anyone who has gone through a series of in
juries like that really do feel for him," Borchardt said.
"He never quits, which is not an easy thing to do if
you're not seeing a lot of rewards for your hard work."
Despite the fact that he still has one more year of el
igibility, Logan doesn't think he'll be back for another
season.
And although he has not reaped many rewards
from his time on the court (37 points in 1 14 min
utes), the reward for his hard work in the classroom
will be the largest of all. A year from June, lie will
graduate with a degree in Management Science and
Engineering, and lie has .hopes of attaining a mas
ter's in business.
Logan will also be with his team next week on Se
nior Day at Maples Pavilion, and whether he'll be in
uniform or street clothes really won't be important.
What will be important is that he will deserve just as
many accolades and applause as every other senior who
lias gone through the basketball program in the past.
And he'll deserve it for those two simple reasons:
He has paid his dues. And he has waited for his time to
come.
