# Student-initiated courses present new topics
## Students spearhead a variety of courses spanning several disciplines 
### ROSE JENKINS 
A "victory for free thought, free speech
and free academic pursuit" is how junior
Jason Rheins, creator of one of this quarter's
student initiated courses, described his class,
"Introduction to Objectivism: Philosophy of
Ayn Rand."
Other winter quarter SICs also include

"Mental Illness and the Veteran Population,"
"Behind the Black Mask: Philosophy, History
and Practice of Anarchism," "Wounds in the
Sand: The Ari/ona-Sonora Border Regions"
and "Understanding 9-11: Its Causes, (lon
text and Consequences." These classes join
the ranks of numerous other student-taught
courses that have added to Stanford's cur
riculum since the program's inception in win
ter quarter 2001.
According to program co-coordinator and
senior Shannon Ashford, the idea for the
program came from brainstorming about
ways to supplement faculty-led classes. The
courses often address specific topics which

are not often examined in a university set
ting, and that benefits from the special ex
pertise student teachers. For example, when
teaching a course about Niger, senior Chad
Alvarez used slides and photos from his trav
el in the region.
Courses are also expected to have a com
munity service component, such as the plant
ing of crops at the Stanford Farm conducted
by a class in sustainable agriculture.
"One of the most important roles of these
classes is to give students the chance to ex
change intellectually and socially with their
peers," Ashford said.
Although the primary respon
sibility of the students is to teach, a
great deal of preparation and or
ganization takes place outside the
classroom. Ashford and her fellow
co-coordinator, senior Rebecca
Trotzky-Sirr, are responsible for
setting up a Web site and organiz
ing an advisory board for the pro

gram. The pair also takes care of
correspondence with the larger
community, particularly the
ASSU, from which the program
receives special-fee funding.
The co-coordinators also over
see the application process for
teaching a class, which begins the
quarter before the class is offered.
They meet frequently with the
prospective leaders to assist them
in creating detailed class-by-class
syllabi and finding faculty spon
sors. This interaction is used to
determine whether the appli

cants have the enthusiasm and
preparation that are necessary
for successfully teaching a class.
Once classes are approved,
they can vary widely in structure,
size and goals. Though proposed
and coordinated by senior Eliza
beth Aab, the class, "Understand
ing 9-1 1: Its Causes, Context, and
Consequences," actually consists
of weekly guest lecturers, such as
Michael Elliot of Time magazine.
It is also complemented by dis
cussion sections taught by nine
different students who share the

responsibility for the class, in
which more than 70 students are
enrolled. They also lead smaller
discussion sections, utilizing the
information from lecture.
" The goal is that students can
become better informed and
more active in their discussions,"
Aab said.
An international relations
major, Aab praised the experi
ence of teaching the course:
"It's been the defining aspect
of my senior year," she said. "It's
been really fun."

On the opposite end of the size
spectrum, with only eleven stu
dents, is Rheins' introductory
class on objectivism. It alternates
between seminars by guest lectur
ers — mostly philosophy profes
sors — and sections.
Although Rheins was ulti
mately able to secure an econom
ics professor as a sponsor, initial
ly he experienced difficulty in
finding support.
"Objectivism is woefully un
derrepresented in the Depart
ment of Philosophy," Rheins said.

"Academia has deliberately
turned a blind eye to Ayn Rand."
Rheins, who hopes to become
a professor of philosophy, said
that the course is helping him
gain valuable teaching experi
ence and solidify his understand
ing of objectivism.
"It forces people, even if they
disagree with [Rand's] ideas, to
confront them," Rheins said.
"Stanford University's environ
ment typically only allows room
for disagreement in a very nar
row arena."
