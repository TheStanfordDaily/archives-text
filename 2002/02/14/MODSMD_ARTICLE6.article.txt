# All-Campus Assassins to begin
## ASSU plans a campus-wide version of a popular dorm-based game. 
### RACHEL NAKAUCHI 
There has been a lot of skulking around campus lately.
It seems that no one is trustworthy.
Within each dorm, roommates are plotting each other's
downfall, and even resident assistants are turning on their
own freshmen as targets, waiting, like the hunter and
Bambi's mother, for the perfect unguarded moment.
The ASSU Student I.ife Committee is organizing
a campus-wide version of Assassins, the infamous

game in which students deviously shadow best
friends and enemies alike.
The game works by sec retly assigning students a
fellow resident whom they must successfully target
using water pistols.
It will take place for the first time beginning
sometime this month.
Previously confined within individual dorms,
the new all-campus game will pit students from
each dorm against each other in pursuit of the ulti
mate water-soaked glory.
The game is being organized by ASSU Sena
tor and junior Eric Lai, a member of the Student
Life Committee.
"All-campus Assassins is intended to serve as a
medium through which we can
bring together people from all
areas of campus who wouldn't or
dinarily meet," said.
According to Lai, in a Univer
sity faced with sprawling resi
dences and students hampered
by busy schedules and limited so
cial lives, special events like this
game are intended to foster a
feeling of community.
Students from east, west and
central residences will come to
gether to play.
The idea seems to be working.
Every undergraduate resi
dence on campus participated by
submitting two students to repre
sent it in the game. The selection
process was left to the discretion of

the RAs in each dorm.
Residents were responsible for
submitting the names of their two
champions by yesterday. For the
purposes of the game, names must
remain confidential until the win
ner is declared.
Aside from building campus
unity for those who choose to
participate, the game is simply
about having a good time, ac
cording to organizers.
"It's just kind of fun to be very
paranoid for about a week," senior
Ben Richter said.
Kit liter was the champion of
Roble Hall's version of Assassins,
and is also a resident computing
coordinator for the dorm.
"[The game] does help build
community," he said. "Towards
the end, more people get involved
than just those assassins left to be
terminated. And it provided for
lots of talk during mealtimes."

Richter*s winning tactic was to
never use the same method for as
sassination twice in a row.
Freshman Alex Gurevich also
participated in Roble's game.
"It takes your mind off of
work." Gurevich said. "The whole
week you are suspicious, and
you're making plans with other
people and talking to each other."
He also offered advice for
success.
"The best way to get someone is
in the back," he said.
Gurevich expressed enthusi
asm for the next game.
"1 would definitely play again,
especially since 1 didn't win this
time," Gurevich said.
The game is tentatively set to
start in late February. With about
HO or so students expected to com
pete, the final victor left dry in the
end will receive a prize courtesy of
the ASSII.
