### GEORGE K.TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Edith and Norman
Abrams Fellowships in Children,
Youth and the Law, established by
William Abrams. class of I will
be awarded this year, following a
one-year moratorium in 2001.
The fellowships recognize
students researching and work

ing with children's legal issues.
"Fellowships were not awarded
last year due to the limited si/e of the
applicant pool," said Abrams, a fac
ulty member in the program in
human biology.
Abrams established the fellow
ships in 2000 and cites his parents
among his inspirations.
'"Hie fellowships were founded in
honor of my parents, Edith and Nor
man Abrams," he said. "They truly
had ast rong set of social values."
One of the two Abrams fellow
ships is worth $3,000. It will be
awarded through the Haas (Center
for Public Service to a student plan
ning to pursue a full-time summer

service project related to children
and the law.
Karyn Bechtel, fellowship pro
gram coordinator at the Haas
Center, encouraged prospective
applicants to demonstrate a
strong commitment to the com
munity in their proposals.
"Applications are reviewed pri
marily on the quality of the collalx>-
ration and interaction with the com
munity partner and community
Ixing served," Bechtel said. "They
are reviewed on the applicant's flexi
bility and willingness loadjust project
plans in accordance with community
needs and the innovation in die pro
ject design."
In selecting applicants, the com
mittee also seeks projects that will
have a strong social impact .
"Summer Fellows engage in
some of society's most pressing con
cerns in the Bay Area, across the na
tion and in other countries," Bech
tel said. "For example, Lynne
Echenberg received the fellowship
in 2000 to work with the Legal Aid
Society's Juvenile Rights Division in
Manhattan, helping them establish
a Delinquency Compliance Unit
that would work to ensure youth of
fenders in the custody of New York
State's Office of Children and Fam
ily Services receive critical court-or
dered services."
Although fellowship providers pre
fer undergraduate applicants, gradu
ating seniors and graduate students
may also apply. Students from all aca
demic backgrounds and ;ill levels of
community service involvement are
encouraged to apply.
The second Abrams fellowship is
worth $1,500. It will be awarded
through the Program in Human Bi
ology for an original research pro
posal that centers on youth and legal
issues.
According to the fellowship de
scription, the research can be un
dertaken in any quarter, including
summer quarter, and should gener
ally tike 6 to 12 months to complete.
Similar to the service fellowship, stu
dents from any major are'eligible to
apply and preference is given to un
dergraduate students who will be
enrolled next fall.
According to fellowship organiz
ers, students should emphasize how
t hey plan to use t he monetary award.
"They must demonstrate need
for the funds," Abrams said.
Sameena Beguvvala, class of2ool,
was a recipient of an Abrams fellow
ship in 2000. She explained how she
applied her funds to research.
" ITie fellowship award supported

my research internship and project
at the National Health Law Program
in Los Angeles, where 1 investigated
the reasons behind the lack of access
for underprivileged children in Cali
fornia to dental care," she said.
Winners for both Abrams fel
lowships are selected by two com
mittees, in each of which Abranis
plays an active role.
In the future, Abrams said he
hopes to establish a greater number

of fellowships.
"As student interest in and de
mand tortile fellowships rise, I'd like
to increase die number of fellowships
awarded," Ik- said.
The deadline for both fellowships
is 5:00 p.m. on Mar. 1. Students in
