An American Muslim gave
personal accounts of his "hajj,"
or pilgrimage to Mecca, last
night, in a talk sponsored by the
Islamic Society of Stanford Uni
versity and the Office of Reli
gious Life.
Michael Abdul Majeed Wolfe,
a documentary filmmaker and
author of books on poetry, fic
tion, travel and history, reflected
on what many characterize as a
life-altering experience.
Hajj is an annual event un
dertaken by Muslims in America
and around the world. * This
year, it falls in mid-February.
For those Muslims who have
the physical and financial ability
to embark on the journey, it is a
once-in-a-lifetime obligation and
a form of worship that involves
the entire being â€” body, mind
and soul.
"The Hajj is a pilgrimage
that has been going on for hun
dreds of years," Wolfe said. "It
is a return to Mecca, the spiri
tual center."
Ilajj is one of the five pillars
of Islam.
I lie other pillars include de
claring one's laith, praying
daily, offering regular charity

Documentary filmmaker and author Michael Wolfe, an American Mus
lim, spoke to students last night about his trip to Mecca. This spiritual pil
grimage is one of the five pillars of Islam.
and fasting during the month of
Ramadan.
A Muslim team of five individ
uals, including Wolfe, set out to
document the hajj in 1997 for
ABC's "Nightline" with Ted
Koppel.
"Mecca is a city that can only be
entered by Muslims," said Wolfe.
The objective of the documen
tary, " The Hajj: One American's
Pilgrimage to Mecca," was to give
the viewers "a sense of the scope
and the depth from a Muslim's
point of view," Wolfe said.
"Anyone who has watched this
film without knowing anything
about Islam could not say 'I know
nothing about Islam,' " he said.
According to Wolfe, the experi
ence of the hajj is something that
cannot easily be put into words.
"You're praying with hun
dreds of thousands of peo
ple . . . you feel that there is some
thing bigger, more powerful than
you," he said.
Wolfe was not originally a
Muslim. After finishing his uni

versity work, he went to North
Africa, a predominantly Muslim
area, where he was introduced
to Islam.
"In the [United] States we're
led to believe that these are dan
gerous societies," Wolfe said. "On
the contrary, there is nothing like
traveling in the Muslim world . . .
women are respected, safe."
Wolfe did not convert to Islam
until twenty years after his visit to
the Muslim world.
"It was the prayer that led me
to it for spiritual reasons, not a
book [or] a teacher... it was the
prayer," he said. "[There is] not a
lot of mystery in Islam. [Prayer is]
just something you do . . . it's be
tween you and God."
Wolfe and his partner Alex
Kronemer are currently at work
on a two-hour television docu
mentary on the life and times of
the Prophet Muhammad.
"Muhammad: In the Footsteps
of a Prophet," is set to air nation
ally on public television later this
year.
"People don't understand
Islam," Kronemer said. "We're
telling a story about somebody
who lived 1,400 years ago through
the experiences of the people who

live today."
Representatives from the soci
ety expressed similar sentiments.
"A lot of the Stanford commu
nity does not know about the hajj.
. . we're fortunate to have [Wolfe
and Kronemer] come and give us
their input," third-year medical
student Omar Latif, the society's
president, said.
"The [society], in response to
Sept. 11, has been working on a
series of events to increase the
public's awareness of Islam," se
nior Randa Serag said.
Serag was one of the organizers
of the event.
"There is increased interest to
understand Islam, to under
stand their Muslim neighbors,"
she said.
"It's necessary during this reli
gious time for the Stanford com
munity to understand the Muslim
students' background," freshman
Mabrookah Heneidi, the modera
tor of Wolfe's talk, said. "The vast
majority of people don't under
stand Islam. There is a general de
sire to learn more."
In the future, the society plans
to sponsor a number of activities
to increase the public's awareness
and understanding of Islam.
