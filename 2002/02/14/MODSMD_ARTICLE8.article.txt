An American Muslim gave
personal accounts of his "hajj,"
or pilgrimage to Mecca, last
night, in a talk sponsored by the
Islamic Society of Stanford Uni
versity and the Office of Reli
gious Life.
Michael Abdul Majeed Wolfe,
a documentary filmmaker and
author of books on poetry, fic
tion, travel and history, reflected
on what many characterize as a
life-altering experience.
Hajj is an annual event un
dertaken by Muslims in America
and around the world. * This
year, it falls in mid-February.
For those Muslims who have
the physical and financial ability
to embark on the journey, it is a
once-in-a-lifetime obligation and
a form of worship that involves
the entire being â€” body, mind
and soul.
"The Hajj is a pilgrimage
that has been going on for hun
dreds of years," Wolfe said. "It
is a return to Mecca, the spiri
tual center."
Ilajj is one of the five pillars
of Islam.
I lie other pillars include de
claring one's laith, praying
daily, offering regular charity
