### CINDY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Bush administration has
recently expanded health insur
ance coverage to prenatal care.
Secretary of Health and Human
Services Tommy Thompson
proposed last month that the
Children's Health Insurance
Program might also cover pre
natal care.
CHIP was created in 1997 to
provide health insurance cover
age for children of low-income
families who did not qualify for
Medicaid. CHll' is administered
by individual states, though 70
percent of the program is feder
ally funded.

President Eva St. Clair pointed
out that nearly 1 1 million
women of child-bearing age lack
health insurance in the United
States. The proposed regulation
takes important steps towards
targeting this issue.
"This legislation is a great
thing for [women]," St. Clair
said. "Being pregnant is cer
tainly a health issue, whether
or not the fetus is desired.

[Students for Life] is interest
ed in improving health care
for women, so we are very
pleased that prenatal care has
finally been taken into consid
eration for poverty-stricken
women."
The regulation would allow
suites to extend CHIP coverage
to prenatal care and delivery
services for low-income women,
according to Thompson.
However, because states have
the authority to set eligibility re
quirements, the effectiveness of
the proposition could vary from
state to state. States can already
apply for waivers through the
federal government if they wish
to offer coverage to the parents
of enrolled children or preg
nant women.
The proposition implies that
the embryo is now defined as a
"child" from the moment of
conception. Although the ad
ministration has emphasized
potential improvements in pre
natal care for low income
women, controversy over the
definition of "child" extends be
yond the debate of health insur
ance coverage.
