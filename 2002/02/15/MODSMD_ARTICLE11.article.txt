# Medical school professor discovers drug that may help fight cancer
## 
### VICTOR REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An ancient Chinese herb might have a
role in the fight against cancer, according
to the recent research results of Pulmonary
and Critical Care Medicine Prof. Glenn
Rosen. Tripterygium wilfordii, or "lei gong
teng," a vine found in southern China that
has long played a part in traditional herbal
remedies, may soon help cancer patients.
Triptolide, an extract from the herb, en
hances the effects of chemotherapy.
"There is real synergy between
chemotherapy and triptolide," Rosen said.

"When we use small concentrations of
each, we can significantly enhance the abil
ity of both to kill tumor cells, without using
large doses of each."
Rosen and the Palo Alto-based compa
ny Pharmagenesis patented his discovery
in November and hope to begin phase one
of the Food and Drug Administration's
drug development process in the next few
months. Triptolide may be available to pa
tients in a few years, according to Rosen.
Many chemotherapy drugs activate the
p53 protein, which prevents cancer cells
from replicating by cell division. Rosen
and his lab team discovered that tumor

cells treated with triptolide, alongside a
typical chemotherapy drug called doxoru
bicin, stopped dividing and eventually
died off. Triptolide can fight cancer cells
even after their p53 genes mutate, making
the genes resistant to other drugs.
Rosen and his team also found that they
could administer low doses of triptolide
and doxorubicin and still achieve excellent
results. By keeping the quantities of the
extract and the chemotherapy drug low in
patients, doctors can avoid strong negative
side effects.
"It's one of the few demonstrations
of true synergy where both together

act much better than either alone,"
Rosen said.
How did an extract from a vine in
China find its way into a Stanford lab?
In the 19705, scientists characterized
triptolide as a toxic agent, but didn't study
it further. Then Prof. Peter Kao, also in
the Pulmonary and Critical Care depart
ment and in the lab next door to Rosen,
began to research how triptolide affected
different cell-death pathways.
Rosen believes that more modern treat
ment methods will arise from a study of an
cient herbs like T. wilfordii and other plants.
"There are active substances in plants

which — when we look further and we pu
rify them — have potent activity against
different disease processes," he said.
Scientists are only "starting to scratch
the surface" as they examine the natural
world in order to develop new drugs,
said Rosen.
"We're looking everywhere — at
plants, algae, animals, bacteria — for
products that might help fight dis
ease processes," he said. "These are
rich sources."
Rosen's lab group includes postdoctor
al fellows Wen-teh Chang, Cathie Chung,
Mingxing Gao and Ke Wei.
