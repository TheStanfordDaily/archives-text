## The 						Stanford Daily Controversy inevitable in selection of speaker 
### 
The senior class presidents' recent an
nouncement that National Security Ad
viser Condoleezza Rice will serve as this
year's commencement speaker elicited
a flurry of criticism similar to that which arose
from Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina's
selection a year ago.
The views expressed by Rice's critics indicate
legitimate concerns about the former provost's
role in national and global issues, but we do not
believe they constitute evidence that her selection
was inappropriate.
Attacks on the University's choice of Rice to
address this year's graduates have focused on
the fact that she has endorsed and helped to
enact policies with which a substantial number
of Stanford students strongly disagree. Yet any
one who occupies a prominent position on the
national or international stage will necessarily
possess some views that are controversial —
show us someone who has never done anything

to which some Stanford students could object on
ideological grounds, and we'll show you some
one who has never done anything of import in
the public sphere.
One need only reflect on the maelstrom of con
troversy provoked by Fiorina's selection to realize
that some dissent is inevitable in the speaker-se
lection process. Fiorina is not a political figure, but
her choice as the 2001 Commencement speaker
provoked an unprecedented degree of outrage.
Granted, some of this dissent came from the
dearth of student input in the selection process,
but a great deal of the controversy stemmed pre
cisely from her lack of political relevance (espe
cially following the previous year's speech by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan).
It is impossible to have it both ways. While
Annan's selection was certainly less divisive than
that of Fiorina or Rice — perhaps because of his
popular image as a defender of liberal ideals — he
was by no means immune to controversy. His or

ganization's sanctions against Iraq represent one
of the most vilified international policies of the
decade and are often cited as a primary cause of
anti-Western sentiment in the Middle East.
As many students have pointed out, it is im
perative that the University adhere to its stated
policy of impartiality on political matters. But that
does not mean that it must strictly avoid the se
lection of a speaker who is involved in public af
fairs and public policy-making.
Inviting someone to speak at graduation does
not imply that the University agrees with every
thing she has ever done or advocated. The speak
er's role is to lend the wisdom and experience of a
distinguished and relevant life course to an event
that celebrates outgoing seniors' potential to be
come the leaders of the future. The people who
are best able to do that are unlikely to be neutral
figures with perfectly unassailable records.

had to tackle difficult dilemmas and face popu

The mixed responses to Rice's selection have
been positive insofar as they have facilitated
thougtful debate about her career as national se

was inappropriate merely because her views do
not represent those of every individual in the se

Controversy is inevitable in the selection of a grad

whose selection would be universally welcomed.
We hope that those seniors who do object to
some of Rice's ideas and actions will join with their

is eager to share her unique perspective with them
