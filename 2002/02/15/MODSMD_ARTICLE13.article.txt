## Enron needs honor code 
### 
Movies are made about every
thing these days— even about
getting into Stanford. So it's
no surprise that people are al
ready talking about making a made-for-
TV movie on the Enron debacle. There's
just one hitch:
"Every day there are incredible revela
tions about the business scandal and the
human side. We need to hit a plateau,
some closure in real life on this first," says
FX Entertainment President Kevin Reilly
in explanation of why the movie can't yet
be made. "The dramatic guts of the story
— cronyism, dishonesty, ambition and
capitalism gone awry — are taking shape
with each passing day."
Sadly, Reilly has summed up the situa
tion perfectly: This story gets worse day

by day, with executives
taking the Fifth daily, the
White House being sued
to release records, a for
mer corporate officer
committing suicide,
thousands of employees
trying to figure out how
to cope with the loss of
their retirement savings
and other companies

taking a hit on the stock market on fears
that they too are hiding something in
their accounting.
It's a mess, and it's an example of how
much in our society depends upon trust.
We tend to think our system of laws is
what ensures the smooth running of our
institutions and the protection of inno
cents. But laws and regulations can only
provide a motivation — if you don't follow
the law, you will be punished — for ethi
cal behavior. Rules cannot force honesty,
especially when the dishonest feel beyond
the law's reach.
We trust that t he law works and is equi
tably applied and is followed by others,
and so we follow the rules ourselves.
When a trust is violated, it throws a lot
of things we take for granted into ques
tion. For instance, if Enron, a company
that Fortune magazine had heralded as
the "Most Innovative" company six years
in a row can, in just a few weeks, go from
Wall Street star to bankrupt fiasco, how
can we trust that other companies are not
in similar straits, similarly being shielded
by unscrupulous accountants?
I low can we trust that our energy poli
cy, formulated by administration officials
and Congressmen, who received sizable
donations from energy companies like
Enron, is in the best interest of the nation
and not just in the interests of energy in
dustry titans?
I low can we trust that other policies are
not being made in the interests of other in
dustries' equivalents of Enron?
The questions have no end. Trust in
corporations is what allows the securities
markets to function. Trust in banks is what
allows us to get past burying our money in

the ground.
Trust in government is what makes
paying our taxes palatable and going to
war bearable. Trust in doctors, trust in
teachers, trust in pilots, trust in pairs fig
ure skating judges (judging by people's re
actions to the Olympics controversy, that
may the most important of all), trust in just
about every profession, is required for our
society to function at its fullest.
And our Stanford society is just the
same. The Enron failure may seem distant
and inconsequential, but think of it as the
equivalent of one of Stanford's dorms —
or make that one of Stanford's fraternities
(Former Enron Chairman and CEO Ken
neth Lay's Bush-given nickname of
"Kenny Boy" fits that analogy better).
If the fraternity's leaders were found to
be stealing away their group's fundraising
proceeds and then shut down when they
graduated, leaving things to fall apart as
they moved on, we would be appalled —
especially if they had been consistently giv
ing large donations to University Presi
dent John Hennessy.
If the registrar were the Arthur Ander
sen of Stanford, could any graduate or
professional school trust our transcripts?
Or how about Professor Enron? We
lose trust in him and there goes any point
in taking his class, since we can't believe
what he teaches.
But he's just an individual. The loss of
trust in him causes hassles, but we've
grown used to such pains.
We lock our doors, even the dorm
ones, and use the Door King. In the Com
puter Science department, copying of
programming assignments in introducto
ry classes has resulted in the use of a piece
of software that compares submissions
against other ones and against a database
of previous years' submissions for suspi
cious similarities. We go through metal
detectors because we can't trust all our fel
low passengers.
Trust in institutions, like universities,
corporations, and governments, is far
harder to get around, if only because we
have litde choice in choosing to deal with
them, and far harder to regain, as we have
little ability to gauge the sincerity of
change.
In a university, trust and its cause,
honesty, are the necessary ingredients.
I'hey are also what we need fora pros
perous, peaceful society. It would do the
world well for everyone to take the Fun
damental Standard and Honor Code,
no matter how much we joke about
them, with them when they enter the
working world.
An Enron movie may be inevitable, but
we can try to make sure that there are not
similar true stories told over and over in
the years to come.
If we don't, the foundations of society
itself are in danger.

Movies are made about every
thing these days— even about
getting into Stanford. So it's
no surprise that people are al
ready talking about making a made-for-
TV movie on the Enron debacle. There's
just one hitch:
"Every day there are incredible revela
tions about the business scandal and the
human side. We need to hit a plateau,
some closure in real life on this first," says
FX Entertainment President Kevin Reilly
in explanation of why the movie can't yet
be made. "The dramatic guts of the story
— cronyism, dishonesty, ambition and
capitalism gone awry — are taking shape
with each passing day."
Sadly, Reilly has summed up the situa
tion perfectly: This story gets worse day

by day, with executives
taking the Fifth daily, the
White House being sued
to release records, a for
mer corporate officer
committing suicide,
thousands of employees
trying to figure out how
to cope with the loss of
their retirement savings
and other companies

taking a hit on the stock market on fears
that they too are hiding something in
their accounting.
It's a mess, and it's an example of how
much in our society depends upon trust.
We tend to think our system of laws is
what ensures the smooth running of our
institutions and the protection of inno
cents. But laws and regulations can only
provide a motivation — if you don't follow
the law, you will be punished — for ethi
cal behavior. Rules cannot force honesty,
especially when the dishonest feel beyond
the law's reach.
We trust that t he law works and is equi
tably applied and is followed by others,
and so we follow the rules ourselves.
When a trust is violated, it throws a lot
of things we take for granted into ques
tion. For instance, if Enron, a company
that Fortune magazine had heralded as
the "Most Innovative" company six years
in a row can, in just a few weeks, go from
Wall Street star to bankrupt fiasco, how
can we trust that other companies are not
in similar straits, similarly being shielded
by unscrupulous accountants?
I low can we trust that our energy poli
cy, formulated by administration officials
and Congressmen, who received sizable
donations from energy companies like
Enron, is in the best interest of the nation
and not just in the interests of energy in
dustry titans?
I low can we trust that other policies are
not being made in the interests of other in
dustries' equivalents of Enron?
The questions have no end. Trust in
corporations is what allows the securities
markets to function. Trust in banks is what
allows us to get past burying our money in

the ground.
Trust in government is what makes
paying our taxes palatable and going to
war bearable. Trust in doctors, trust in
teachers, trust in pilots, trust in pairs fig
ure skating judges (judging by people's re
actions to the Olympics controversy, that
may the most important of all), trust in just
about every profession, is required for our
society to function at its fullest.
And our Stanford society is just the
same. The Enron failure may seem distant
and inconsequential, but think of it as the
equivalent of one of Stanford's dorms —
or make that one of Stanford's fraternities
(Former Enron Chairman and CEO Ken
neth Lay's Bush-given nickname of
"Kenny Boy" fits that analogy better).
If the fraternity's leaders were found to
be stealing away their group's fundraising
proceeds and then shut down when they
graduated, leaving things to fall apart as
they moved on, we would be appalled —
especially if they had been consistently giv
ing large donations to University Presi
dent John Hennessy.
If the registrar were the Arthur Ander
sen of Stanford, could any graduate or
professional school trust our transcripts?
Or how about Professor Enron? We
lose trust in him and there goes any point
in taking his class, since we can't believe
what he teaches.
But he's just an individual. The loss of
trust in him causes hassles, but we've
grown used to such pains.
We lock our doors, even the dorm
ones, and use the Door King. In the Com
puter Science department, copying of
programming assignments in introducto
ry classes has resulted in the use of a piece
of software that compares submissions
against other ones and against a database
of previous years' submissions for suspi
cious similarities. We go through metal
detectors because we can't trust all our fel
low passengers.
Trust in institutions, like universities,
corporations, and governments, is far
harder to get around, if only because we
have litde choice in choosing to deal with
them, and far harder to regain, as we have
little ability to gauge the sincerity of
change.
In a university, trust and its cause,
honesty, are the necessary ingredients.
I'hey are also what we need fora pros
perous, peaceful society. It would do the
world well for everyone to take the Fun
damental Standard and Honor Code,
no matter how much we joke about
them, with them when they enter the
working world.
An Enron movie may be inevitable, but
we can try to make sure that there are not
similar true stories told over and over in
the years to come.
If we don't, the foundations of society
itself are in danger.
