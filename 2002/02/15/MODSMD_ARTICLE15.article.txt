Coalition defends actions at meeting
with Hennessy
We would like to make a statement in
regards to The Daily's coverage of the
Coalition for Labor Justice's presence at
the ASSU/GSC meeting with University
President John Hennessy. Our intention
was not to take over or disrupt the meet
ing, but to bring important and pressing
concerns to the Hennessy's attention.
The quotes in the front-page article
misrepresented what really occurred
during the meeting. Choosing to dress in
black was not a "scare tactic" [as said by
Brigitte Zimmerman] but a sign of unity
among coalition members who came
representing different student groups.
Furthermore, we respectfully listened
to the entire meeting and did not disrupt
any of the question-and-answer session
between the ASSU, the Graduate Student
Council and Hennessy.
During the last two minutes of the
meeting, time was given to our coalition to
question Hennessy on his exclusion of stu
dents and workers from decision -making
regarding Stanford University worker
wage levels, an issue pushed in part by the
student body.
A question about labor issues on cam
pus was on the agenda for the meeting.
I he only reason our coalition posed this
question rather than an ASSU / GSC rep
resentative was because Hennessy's an
nouncement was completely unexpected
and contrary to the goal of a code of con
duct for all Stanford workers, which we
had begun to lay out with the adminis
tration at previous meetings. Therefore,
the ASSU allowed us to speak on the
issue as we had the most recent and
pressing information.
We want to make it clear that we were
speaking for the Coalition and our sup

porters, not the ASSU or GSC, the major
ity of whose representatives were not in
formed that we would be speaking.
The confrontational tone taken on by
both Hennessy and spokespeople for the
coalition reflected a couple of different
things. We did not intend to escalate the
conversation with Hennessy to a level
which would make the ASSU and GSC un
comfortable. We understand that the
working relationship between the ASSU,
the GSC and the administration is very im
portant and it has never been our inten
tion to jeopardize that relationship.
At the same time, the confrontational
tone of the exchange also reflected a gen
eral frustration felt by the coalition and its
supporters at yet another example of stu
dents' voices being marginalized and
workers' voices being completely absent in
important discussions and decisions that
have been made by Hennessy, the Board
of Trustees and other members of the ad
ministration. Our coalition had been
meeting with Hennessy and other admin
istrators since last quarter.
Hennessy interrupted a process and
went back on commitments to work with
students and workers by making this type
of decision without consulting either
workers or students. We believe that a
question-answer accountability session
with Hennessy is an appropriate forum
for these issues to be raised, and the ASSU
stands by students' right to have our voic
es heard.
We are committed to making Stanford a
place that truly reflects the needs of the
people who work and learn here. We begin
by asking Hennessy and appropriate
members of the University administration
to sit down with the Coalition for
Justice, with union representatives and
Stanford workers to create a responsible
Code of Conduct that will commit our Uni

versity to a fundamental philosophy that
believes people not only deserve wages and
benefits that keep them above the poverty
line, but the right to have a voice in their
places of employment and education.
THE COALITION FOR LABOR JUSTICE

Confrontation sometimes necessary for
social change
I object to The Daily's unfair coverage
of the actions taken by the Coalition for
Labor Justice at Tuesday's ASSU/GSC
meeting. The writing of the editorial
("ASSU, SLAC behavior harms student
causes," 2/14/02) was inflammatory and
reflects a general lack of understanding of
what student voice is all about.
I fully support the right of students to
take their issues directly to University Pres
ident John Hennessey in a public forum
and for the administration to be challenged
openly on their policies. That is what a
democratic instituion must encourage.
The editorial claimed to put "politics
aside" in its assessment of the meeting. But
really, this is all about politics. Every fun
damental change that has ever taken place
both in the University's history and in our
country's history has been the result of di
rect pressure and agitation of students
and people in general.
We just commemmorated "Take Back
the Mic," in which members of the Black
Student Union took the microphone away
from the provost as he was addressing the
entire student body. I am sure this action
was not seen as "respectful" by many. It
was confrontational. It was a spectacle. It
was a clear demand. And it was absolutely
the right thing to do.
It's easy to look back on that event after
30 years and see it as justified and ad
mirable (because I'm sure it wasn't re
ceived well by everybody at the time).
What's harder is to recognize the issues of
today â€” to see what needs to be chal
lenged and changed in our own universi
ty and in the broader world.
We need to recognize the urgency of
the issues that the Coalition for Labor Jus
lice is working on and realize that speak
ing up at an ASSU meeting is completely
justified and appropriate.

Stanford has several
undergraduate journals
The Daily reported that "Stanford
now has an undergraduate academic
journal that publishes student research"
on Feb. 13. This journal "seeks to vital
ize interest in all academic disciplines
and vitalize there [sic] many implica
tions for society," according to its Web
page. The Daily's reporting and the
founders of the new journal missed at
least the last eight years of Stanford un
dergraduate publishing.
The Stanford Journal of International
Relations is one of the country's few un
dergraduate academic 1R journals, with

copies distributed nationally to university
libraries and political think tanks. The
Dualist, Stanford's undergraduate philos
ophy journal, was founded by Stanford
students in 1994 and is considered the
country's premiere undergraduate phi
losophy journal. The Stanford Economics
Journal, Glosses (Stanford's undergradu
ate English journal), Herodotus (Stan
ford's undergraduate history journal),
and the Stanford Journal of East Asian Af
fairs all publish student research. Though
an additional journal publishing under
graduate research could create a new
forum, this journal overlaps with scholar
ly undergraduate publications that are al
ready thriving.
Stanford has established undergradu
ate publications of esteemed quality and is
already "among the ranks of MIT, Cal
tech, and Harvard" without the Under
graduate Research Journal.
As editors of these established journals,
we encourage students to recognize the
breadth and depth of existing undergrad
uate academic publications at Stanford.

journals mentioned above, please contact

University takes political stance with
Rice's selection
We are highly disturbed by the Univer
sity's decision to select National Security
Adviser Condoleezza Rice as the 2002
Commencement speaker. By choosing
(and thus coming out in blatant support of)
Rice, the University is inappropriately pre
senting her as a non-controversial tigure,
despite her prominent role in what is a
highly controversial current foreign policy.
According to senior class president
Serge Kassardjian (as quoted in the Feb.
11 Daily article), "[W]e wanted a speaker
who would be able to talk about [Sept. 11 ]
with authority and perspective. We can
think of no better way to end the year than
with the observations and advice of a lead
er who figures so prominently in con
fronting the issues of our time."
University President John Hennessy
also commented on Rice's appropriate
ness as "someone who has a central place
on the world stage." It seems, then, that
Rice's political affiliation was explicitly a
factor in her selection.
The Stanford administration has al
ways made it very clear to student groups,
however, that the University will not take
a political stance on any issue. We under
stand that at an educational institution
that claims to foster diversity of opinion,
this policy is appropriate. By supporting a
particular political agenda, the University
ceases to be a neutral /.one lor academic
discussion and could instead become a po
litical tool, a dangerous precedent.
With the recent decision to invite Rice
to speak at Commencement 2002, the

University is thus completely violating its
own policy. Rice, whose "access to the
President is second only to Laura Bush,"
according to the Daily's Feb. 11 editorial,
is unequivocally tied to a particular politi
cal agenda. It doesn't matter, as seniors
Bob McGrew, Brooke Brody-Waite, Grey
Baker and Christopher Desmond pointed
out in their Feb. 14 letter to the editor, that
she is "one of our own," or that she is a
scholar and former provost.
Even if her speech does not direct
ly push her political agenda, her cur
rent position as national security advi
sor in what is a globally controversial
national foreign policy campaign
makes her political.
This obvious contradiction between
Stanford's policy and Rice's selection is a
slap in the face to students like us who do
not agree with the current actions of the
Bush administration in its "war on terror
ism." The Daily's editorial contends that
Rice "behaves politically not to promote
her party's agenda but as a servant. to her
nation, and her message has always been
one of unity."
However, just as current foreign poli
cy reflects unity only insofar as voices of
dissent are being ignored, the selection
of Rice as our Commencement speaker
disregards any dialogue questioning our
nation's role and actions in the global
community.

nouncement was completely unexpected
and contrary to the goal of a code of con
duct for all Stanford workers, which we
had begun to lay out with the adminis
tration at previous meetings. Therefore,
the ASSU allowed us to speak on the
issue as we had the most recent and
pressing information.
We want to make it clear that we were
speaking for the Coalition and our sup

porters, not the ASSU or GSC, the major
ity of whose representatives were not in
formed that we would be speaking.
The confrontational tone taken on by
both Hennessy and spokespeople for the
coalition reflected a couple of different
things. We did not intend to escalate the
conversation with Hennessy to a level
which would make the ASSU and GSC un
comfortable. We understand that the
working relationship between the ASSU,
the GSC and the administration is very im
portant and it has never been our inten
tion to jeopardize that relationship.
At the same time, the confrontational
tone of the exchange also reflected a gen
eral frustration felt by the coalition and its
supporters at yet another example of stu
dents' voices being marginalized and
workers' voices being completely absent in
important discussions and decisions that
have been made by Hennessy, the Board
of Trustees and other members of the ad
ministration. Our coalition had been
meeting with Hennessy and other admin
istrators since last quarter.
Hennessy interrupted a process and
went back on commitments to work with
students and workers by making this type
of decision without consulting either
workers or students. We believe that a
question-answer accountability session
with Hennessy is an appropriate forum
for these issues to be raised, and the ASSU
stands by students' right to have our voic
es heard.
We are committed to making Stanford a
place that truly reflects the needs of the
people who work and learn here. We begin
by asking Hennessy and appropriate
members of the University administration
to sit down with the Coalition for
Justice, with union representatives and
Stanford workers to create a responsible
Code of Conduct that will commit our Uni

versity to a fundamental philosophy that
believes people not only deserve wages and
benefits that keep them above the poverty
line, but the right to have a voice in their
places of employment and education.
THE COALITION FOR LABOR JUSTICE

Confrontation sometimes necessary for
social change
I object to The Daily's unfair coverage
of the actions taken by the Coalition for
Labor Justice at Tuesday's ASSU/GSC
meeting. The writing of the editorial
("ASSU, SLAC behavior harms student
causes," 2/14/02) was inflammatory and
reflects a general lack of understanding of
what student voice is all about.
I fully support the right of students to
take their issues directly to University Pres
ident John Hennessey in a public forum
and for the administration to be challenged
openly on their policies. That is what a
democratic instituion must encourage.
The editorial claimed to put "politics
aside" in its assessment of the meeting. But
really, this is all about politics. Every fun
damental change that has ever taken place
both in the University's history and in our
country's history has been the result of di
rect pressure and agitation of students
and people in general.
We just commemmorated "Take Back
the Mic," in which members of the Black
Student Union took the microphone away
from the provost as he was addressing the
entire student body. I am sure this action
was not seen as "respectful" by many. It
was confrontational. It was a spectacle. It
was a clear demand. And it was absolutely
the right thing to do.
It's easy to look back on that event after
30 years and see it as justified and ad
mirable (because I'm sure it wasn't re
ceived well by everybody at the time).
What's harder is to recognize the issues of
today â€” to see what needs to be chal
lenged and changed in our own universi
ty and in the broader world.
We need to recognize the urgency of
the issues that the Coalition for Labor Jus
lice is working on and realize that speak
ing up at an ASSU meeting is completely
justified and appropriate.

Stanford has several
undergraduate journals
The Daily reported that "Stanford
now has an undergraduate academic
journal that publishes student research"
on Feb. 13. This journal "seeks to vital
ize interest in all academic disciplines
and vitalize there [sic] many implica
tions for society," according to its Web
page. The Daily's reporting and the
founders of the new journal missed at
least the last eight years of Stanford un
dergraduate publishing.
The Stanford Journal of International
Relations is one of the country's few un
dergraduate academic 1R journals, with

copies distributed nationally to university
libraries and political think tanks. The
Dualist, Stanford's undergraduate philos
ophy journal, was founded by Stanford
students in 1994 and is considered the
country's premiere undergraduate phi
losophy journal. The Stanford Economics
Journal, Glosses (Stanford's undergradu
ate English journal), Herodotus (Stan
ford's undergraduate history journal),
and the Stanford Journal of East Asian Af
fairs all publish student research. Though
an additional journal publishing under
graduate research could create a new
forum, this journal overlaps with scholar
ly undergraduate publications that are al
ready thriving.
Stanford has established undergradu
ate publications of esteemed quality and is
already "among the ranks of MIT, Cal
tech, and Harvard" without the Under
graduate Research Journal.
As editors of these established journals,
we encourage students to recognize the
breadth and depth of existing undergrad
uate academic publications at Stanford.

University takes political stance with
Rice's selection
We are highly disturbed by the Univer
sity's decision to select National Security
Adviser Condoleezza Rice as the 2002
Commencement speaker. By choosing
(and thus coming out in blatant support of)
Rice, the University is inappropriately pre
senting her as a non-controversial tigure,
despite her prominent role in what is a
highly controversial current foreign policy.
According to senior class president
Serge Kassardjian (as quoted in the Feb.
11 Daily article), "[W]e wanted a speaker
who would be able to talk about [Sept. 11 ]
with authority and perspective. We can
think of no better way to end the year than
with the observations and advice of a lead
er who figures so prominently in con
fronting the issues of our time."
University President John Hennessy
also commented on Rice's appropriate
ness as "someone who has a central place
on the world stage." It seems, then, that
Rice's political affiliation was explicitly a
factor in her selection.
The Stanford administration has al
ways made it very clear to student groups,
however, that the University will not take
a political stance on any issue. We under
stand that at an educational institution
that claims to foster diversity of opinion,
this policy is appropriate. By supporting a
particular political agenda, the University
ceases to be a neutral /.one lor academic
discussion and could instead become a po
litical tool, a dangerous precedent.
With the recent decision to invite Rice
to speak at Commencement 2002, the

University is thus completely violating its
own policy. Rice, whose "access to the
President is second only to Laura Bush,"
according to the Daily's Feb. 11 editorial,
is unequivocally tied to a particular politi
cal agenda. It doesn't matter, as seniors
Bob McGrew, Brooke Brody-Waite, Grey
Baker and Christopher Desmond pointed
out in their Feb. 14 letter to the editor, that
she is "one of our own," or that she is a
scholar and former provost.
Even if her speech does not direct
ly push her political agenda, her cur
rent position as national security advi
sor in what is a globally controversial
national foreign policy campaign
makes her political.
This obvious contradiction between
Stanford's policy and Rice's selection is a
slap in the face to students like us who do
not agree with the current actions of the
Bush administration in its "war on terror
ism." The Daily's editorial contends that
Rice "behaves politically not to promote
her party's agenda but as a servant. to her
nation, and her message has always been
one of unity."
However, just as current foreign poli
cy reflects unity only insofar as voices of
dissent are being ignored, the selection
of Rice as our Commencement speaker
disregards any dialogue questioning our
nation's role and actions in the global
community.

Coalition defends actions at meeting
with Hennessy
We would like to make a statement in
regards to The Daily's coverage of the
Coalition for Labor Justice's presence at
the ASSU/GSC meeting with University
President John Hennessy. Our intention
was not to take over or disrupt the meet
ing, but to bring important and pressing
concerns to the Hennessy's attention.
The quotes in the front-page article
misrepresented what really occurred
during the meeting. Choosing to dress in
black was not a "scare tactic" [as said by
Brigitte Zimmerman] but a sign of unity
among coalition members who came
representing different student groups.
Furthermore, we respectfully listened
to the entire meeting and did not disrupt
any of the question-and-answer session
between the ASSU, the Graduate Student
Council and Hennessy.
During the last two minutes of the
meeting, time was given to our coalition to
question Hennessy on his exclusion of stu
dents and workers from decision -making
regarding Stanford University worker
wage levels, an issue pushed in part by the
student body.
A question about labor issues on cam
pus was on the agenda for the meeting.
I he only reason our coalition posed this
question rather than an ASSU / GSC rep
resentative was because Hennessy's an

of Trustees and other members of the ad
ministration. Our coalition had been
meeting with Hennessy and other admin
istrators since last quarter.
Hennessy interrupted a process and
went back on commitments to work with
students and workers by making this type
of decision without consulting either
workers or students. We believe that a
question-answer accountability session
with Hennessy is an appropriate forum
for these issues to be raised, and the ASSU
stands by students' right to have our voic
es heard.
We are committed to making Stanford a
place that truly reflects the needs of the
people who work and learn here. We begin
by asking Hennessy and appropriate
members of the University administration
to sit down with the Coalition for
Justice, with union representatives and
Stanford workers to create a responsible
Code of Conduct that will commit our Uni

versity to a fundamental philosophy that
believes people not only deserve wages and
benefits that keep them above the poverty
line, but the right to have a voice in their
places of employment and education.
THE COALITION FOR LABOR JUSTICE

Confrontation sometimes necessary for
social change
I object to The Daily's unfair coverage
of the actions taken by the Coalition for
Labor Justice at Tuesday's ASSU/GSC
meeting. The writing of the editorial
("ASSU, SLAC behavior harms student
causes," 2/14/02) was inflammatory and
reflects a general lack of understanding of
what student voice is all about.
I fully support the right of students to
take their issues directly to University Pres
ident John Hennessey in a public forum
and for the administration to be challenged
openly on their policies. That is what a
democratic instituion must encourage.
The editorial claimed to put "politics
aside" in its assessment of the meeting. But
really, this is all about politics. Every fun
damental change that has ever taken place
both in the University's history and in our
country's history has been the result of di
rect pressure and agitation of students
and people in general.
We just commemmorated "Take Back
the Mic," in which members of the Black
Student Union took the microphone away
from the provost as he was addressing the
entire student body. I am sure this action
was not seen as "respectful" by many. It
was confrontational. It was a spectacle. It
was a clear demand. And it was absolutely
the right thing to do.
It's easy to look back on that event after
30 years and see it as justified and ad
mirable (because I'm sure it wasn't re
ceived well by everybody at the time).
What's harder is to recognize the issues of
today â€” to see what needs to be chal
lenged and changed in our own universi
ty and in the broader world.
We need to recognize the urgency of
the issues that the Coalition for Labor Jus
lice is working on and realize that speak
ing up at an ASSU meeting is completely
justified and appropriate.

Stanford has several
undergraduate journals
The Daily reported that "Stanford
now has an undergraduate academic
journal that publishes student research"
on Feb. 13. This journal "seeks to vital
ize interest in all academic disciplines
and vitalize there [sic] many implica
tions for society," according to its Web
page. The Daily's reporting and the
founders of the new journal missed at
least the last eight years of Stanford un
dergraduate publishing.
The Stanford Journal of International
Relations is one of the country's few un
dergraduate academic 1R journals, with

copies distributed nationally to university
libraries and political think tanks. The
Dualist, Stanford's undergraduate philos
ophy journal, was founded by Stanford
students in 1994 and is considered the
country's premiere undergraduate phi
losophy journal. The Stanford Economics
Journal, Glosses (Stanford's undergradu
ate English journal), Herodotus (Stan
ford's undergraduate history journal),
and the Stanford Journal of East Asian Af
fairs all publish student research. Though
an additional journal publishing under
graduate research could create a new
forum, this journal overlaps with scholar
ly undergraduate publications that are al
ready thriving.
Stanford has established undergradu
ate publications of esteemed quality and is
already "among the ranks of MIT, Cal
tech, and Harvard" without the Under
graduate Research Journal.
As editors of these established journals,
we encourage students to recognize the
breadth and depth of existing undergrad
uate academic publications at Stanford.

journals mentioned above, please contact

University takes political stance with
Rice's selection
We are highly disturbed by the Univer
sity's decision to select National Security
Adviser Condoleezza Rice as the 2002
Commencement speaker. By choosing
(and thus coming out in blatant support of)
Rice, the University is inappropriately pre
senting her as a non-controversial tigure,
despite her prominent role in what is a
highly controversial current foreign policy.
According to senior class president
Serge Kassardjian (as quoted in the Feb.
11 Daily article), "[W]e wanted a speaker
who would be able to talk about [Sept. 11 ]
with authority and perspective. We can
think of no better way to end the year than
with the observations and advice of a lead
er who figures so prominently in con
fronting the issues of our time."
University President John Hennessy
also commented on Rice's appropriate
ness as "someone who has a central place
on the world stage." It seems, then, that
Rice's political affiliation was explicitly a
factor in her selection.
The Stanford administration has al
ways made it very clear to student groups,
however, that the University will not take
a political stance on any issue. We under
stand that at an educational institution
that claims to foster diversity of opinion,
this policy is appropriate. By supporting a
particular political agenda, the University
ceases to be a neutral /.one lor academic
discussion and could instead become a po
litical tool, a dangerous precedent.
With the recent decision to invite Rice
to speak at Commencement 2002, the

University is thus completely violating its
own policy. Rice, whose "access to the
President is second only to Laura Bush,"
according to the Daily's Feb. 11 editorial,
is unequivocally tied to a particular politi
cal agenda. It doesn't matter, as seniors
Bob McGrew, Brooke Brody-Waite, Grey
Baker and Christopher Desmond pointed
out in their Feb. 14 letter to the editor, that
she is "one of our own," or that she is a
scholar and former provost.
Even if her speech does not direct
ly push her political agenda, her cur
rent position as national security advi
sor in what is a globally controversial
national foreign policy campaign
makes her political.
This obvious contradiction between
Stanford's policy and Rice's selection is a
slap in the face to students like us who do
not agree with the current actions of the
Bush administration in its "war on terror
ism." The Daily's editorial contends that
Rice "behaves politically not to promote
her party's agenda but as a servant. to her
nation, and her message has always been
one of unity."
However, just as current foreign poli
cy reflects unity only insofar as voices of
dissent are being ignored, the selection
of Rice as our Commencement speaker
disregards any dialogue questioning our
nation's role and actions in the global
community.

Coalition defends actions at meeting
with Hennessy
We would like to make a statement in
regards to The Daily's coverage of the
Coalition for Labor Justice's presence at
the ASSU/GSC meeting with University
President John Hennessy. Our intention
was not to take over or disrupt the meet
ing, but to bring important and pressing
concerns to the Hennessy's attention.
The quotes in the front-page article
misrepresented what really occurred
during the meeting. Choosing to dress in
black was not a "scare tactic" [as said by
Brigitte Zimmerman] but a sign of unity
among coalition members who came
representing different student groups.
Furthermore, we respectfully listened
to the entire meeting and did not disrupt
any of the question-and-answer session
between the ASSU, the Graduate Student
Council and Hennessy.
During the last two minutes of the
meeting, time was given to our coalition to
question Hennessy on his exclusion of stu
dents and workers from decision -making
regarding Stanford University worker
wage levels, an issue pushed in part by the
student body.
A question about labor issues on cam
pus was on the agenda for the meeting.
I he only reason our coalition posed this
question rather than an ASSU / GSC rep
resentative was because Hennessy's an
nouncement was completely unexpected
and contrary to the goal of a code of con
duct for all Stanford workers, which we
had begun to lay out with the adminis
tration at previous meetings. Therefore,
the ASSU allowed us to speak on the
issue as we had the most recent and
pressing information.
We want to make it clear that we were
speaking for the Coalition and our sup

porters, not the ASSU or GSC, the major
ity of whose representatives were not in
formed that we would be speaking.
The confrontational tone taken on by
both Hennessy and spokespeople for the
coalition reflected a couple of different
things. We did not intend to escalate the
conversation with Hennessy to a level
which would make the ASSU and GSC un
comfortable. We understand that the
working relationship between the ASSU,
the GSC and the administration is very im
portant and it has never been our inten
tion to jeopardize that relationship.
At the same time, the confrontational
tone of the exchange also reflected a gen
eral frustration felt by the coalition and its
supporters at yet another example of stu
dents' voices being marginalized and
workers' voices being completely absent in
important discussions and decisions that
have been made by Hennessy, the Board
of Trustees and other members of the ad
ministration. Our coalition had been
meeting with Hennessy and other admin
istrators since last quarter.
Hennessy interrupted a process and
went back on commitments to work with
students and workers by making this type
of decision without consulting either

es heard.
