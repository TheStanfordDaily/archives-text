## Card seals Pac-10 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
It was all in a night's work for
the Cardinal.
In a game figured to be close,
the women's basketball team
demonstrated why it is the No. 2
team in the nation by crushing
Washington (15-9, 10-5 Pacific 10
Conference) 81-65 and winning
the Pac 10 outright.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Thursday: No. 2 Stanford 81,
Washington 65

The win improved Stanford's
record to 25-1 and gave it a per
fect 15-0 in conference play head
ing into its last regular-season
home game of the year on Satur
day against Washington State.
Besides the conference title,
the night marked sophomore for
ward Nicole Powell s fourth ca
reer triple-double — her third
this season alone — after she
scored a game-high 21 points,
brought down 10 rebounds, and
dished out a remarkable 12 assists
in 38 minutes of play.
Powell has claimed four of the
Pac-10's 10 recorded triple-dou
bles and four of Stanford's five,
leaving no doubt as to why she is a
finalist for the Naismith Player of
the Year Award.
"Nicole is not just doing things
physically, but she really has her
head in the game," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "She has
a great vision and other people
really feed off her excitement."
Senior center Bethany
Donaphin exploded into the
game from the first minute and
scored her team's first six points
before finishing with 18.
Senior guard Lindsey Ya
masaki quickly got into the ac
tion, draining a three-pointer
after the defense collapsed to
contain Donaphin.
The Huskies came back
strong, following up Yamasaki's

three with 11-4 run of its own to
take the lead 16-15 with about
12:30 left to play.
For the next seven minutes,
the team's exchanged points and
traded leads building up to a 30-
30 tie with about 5:30 to go in the
half before the Cardinal stepped
up its game to a level well out of
Washington's reach.
Playing as the point guard,
Powell brought the ball down the
floor and found Yamasaki on the
perimeter for another of her 5
three-pointers of the night. Pow
ell continued to push the ball dri
ving inside and drawing the de
fense before firing it across to
Donaphin for the easy lay-in.
Senior reserve Enjoli Izidor
had the crowd on its feet on the
next possession, grabbing an of
fensive board and putting it in off
a reverse layup and increasing
the lead to 38-30, continuing a
Stanford run that would give the
team a 44-39 lead at the half.
While the Cardinal's offensive
efforts were rolling, the team was
determined to improve on its de
fense in the second half.
"I was really excited about our
defense in the second half, said
VanDerveer. "I put some chal
lenges to some people for the sec
ond half and it was great to watch
them accept those challenges."
The biggest effort came from
Yamasaki who held Huskies
guard Loree Payne scoreless in
the second half. As a team, the
Cardinal held Washington to
.400 shooting.
On the offensive end, Stanford
continued to dominate.
Freshman forward T'NaeThiel
opened the scoring drive with a
12-foot jumper on her way to col
lecting eight points on the night.
Yamasaki then continued to
dominate on the outside while
Donaphin scored yet again in
transition after a gorgeous inside
pass from freshman guard Kel
ley Suminski in transition. Stan
ford controlled the tempo of the

game throughout the second
half as the Huskies watched their
chance at an upset disappear in
•front of them.
With 7:45 left in the game, the
Cardinal increased its lead to 21
points and all that was left to wait
for was Powell's tenth rebound.
With style, she made the wait
worthwhile, pulling down her

tenth board off an offensive re
bound and put-back inside a sea
ol bodies.
"I thought we played some re
ally great basketball in spurts,"
said VanDerveer. "It was a really
balanced game. We got out there
at them and I thought our de

fense really turned it around for
us in the second half."
After some disappointing sea
sons in the past, the win tonight

and all it signifies, is especially
poignant to the seniors.
"Finally, I (eel this is our year,"
Donaphin said. "Our team is so
excited and we get along so well.
The chemistry is better than its
ever been. We kind of expected it
[the conference championship]
but it's still so sweet."
