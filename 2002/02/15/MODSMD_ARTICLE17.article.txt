# Fresno State presents tough venue for Card
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's traditionally a home-and
home setup, with Fresno State and
Stanford alternating home series
each year.
However, due to delays in ren
ovations to Sunken Diamond last
year, the Cardinal missed its turn
to host the Bulldogs. So for the
third consecutive season, Stanford
must travel to Fresno to take on
Bob Bennett's squad in front of
one of the most hostile crowds in
collegiate baseball.
Over the past two seasons, Stan
ford has won four of five at Beiden
Field, a venue that former Cardi
nal star Joe Borchard, dripping
with sarcasm, once called "a really
nice family environment."

Fresno State's first home series of
the year.

Marquess. "They are a respected
program and tough to play in
Fresno with good crowd support
and a winning attitude."
However, if the Cardinal con
tinues to play like it has over the
early weeks of the season, even the
rowdy fans may not be able to save
the Bulldogs from a team on an of
fensive rampage of late.
Leading the barrage in the pre
season, during which Stanford is
averaging more than nine runs
per contest, is junior catcher Ryan
Garko. Before going 0-for-4 in
Tuesday's 8-1 win over Brigham
Young, Garko was swinging the
bat at a .500 clip and leading the
Cardinal in several offensive cate
gories. He is still in (he top three
on the team in batting average
(.423), hits (11), runs scored (11)

and home runs (2).
With the team chugging along
with a .345 average, it's difficult to
find anyone on the Cardinal not
swinging a hot bat.
Freshman Donny Lucy has
been a pleasant surprise, coming
out of the gate with a .333 average
and a team-leading 10 RBI. His
production has been a welcome
addition to the Cardinal lineup,
which Marquess did not expect to
have such offensive success until
later in the season.
Bennett, in his 34th and final
season as the Bulldogs' head
coach, will be looking to end his
rivalry with Marquess and the
Cardinal on a good note. He re
turns four of his top five starting
pitchers from last season and will
need excellent outings from each
if he hopes to come away with a se
ries win.
Bennett calls on senior Bob
Runyan (1-1, 3.21 ERA) to match
up against Cardinal ace Jeremy

Guthrie (2-0,3.00) for tonight's se
ries opener at 7:05 p.m.
Guthrie has rung up 17 strike
outs while walking just two batters
in his 12 innings pitched, proving
the mettle that makes him one of
the most highly regarded profes
sional prospects in college base
ball. Runyan went 10-1 last season
and hopes to continue that success
against one of the most potent
lineups in the nation.
Tomorrow and Sunday, the
two teams face off with 1:05 starts
at Beiden Field.
While neither team has. an
nounced tomorrow's starting
pitchers, Stanford freshman
Mark Jecman (0-2, 10.50) will
start his third game of the year on
Sunday after showing much im
provement last week against the
No. 4 Seminoles. Bennett will
counter with senior Ben Fritz (1-

final of his coaching career

against one of the most potent
lineups in the nation.
Tomorrow and Sunday, the
two teams face off with 1:05 starts

While neither team has. an

pitchers, Stanford freshman
Mark Jecman (0-2, 10.50) will
start his third game of the year on
Sunday after showing much im
provement last week against the
No. 4 Seminoles. Bennett will
counter with senior Ben Fritz (1-
1, 2.65) in Sunday's game, the
final of his coaching career
against the Cardinal.
It's traditionally a home-and
home setup, with Fresno State and
Stanford alternating home series
each year.
However, due to delays in ren
ovations to Sunken Diamond last
year, the Cardinal missed its turn
to host the Bulldogs. So for the
third consecutive season, Stanford
must travel to Fresno to take on
Bob Bennett's squad in front of
one of the most hostile crowds in
collegiate baseball.
Over the past two seasons, Stan
ford has won four of five at Beiden
Field, a venue that former Cardi
nal star Joe Borchard, dripping
with sarcasm, once called "a really
nice family environment."

Marquess. "They are a respected
program and tough to play in
Fresno with good crowd support
and a winning attitude."
However, if the Cardinal con
tinues to play like it has over the
early weeks of the season, even the
rowdy fans may not be able to save
the Bulldogs from a team on an of
fensive rampage of late.
Leading the barrage in the pre
season, during which Stanford is
averaging more than nine runs
per contest, is junior catcher Ryan
Garko. Before going 0-for-4 in
Tuesday's 8-1 win over Brigham
Young, Garko was swinging the
bat at a .500 clip and leading the
Cardinal in several offensive cate
gories. He is still in (he top three
on the team in batting average
(.423), hits (11), runs scored (11)

and home runs (2).
With the team chugging along
with a .345 average, it's difficult to
find anyone on the Cardinal not
swinging a hot bat.
Freshman Donny Lucy has
been a pleasant surprise, coming
out of the gate with a .333 average
and a team-leading 10 RBI. His
production has been a welcome
addition to the Cardinal lineup,
which Marquess did not expect to
have such offensive success until
later in the season.
Bennett, in his 34th and final
season as the Bulldogs' head
coach, will be looking to end his
rivalry with Marquess and the
Cardinal on a good note. He re
turns four of his top five starting
pitchers from last season and will
need excellent outings from each
if he hopes to come away with a se
ries win.
Bennett calls on senior Bob
Runyan (1-1, 3.21 ERA) to match
up against Cardinal ace Jeremy

Guthrie (2-0,3.00) for tonight's se
ries opener at 7:05 p.m.
Guthrie has rung up 17 strike
outs while walking just two batters
in his 12 innings pitched, proving
the mettle that makes him one of
the most highly regarded profes
sional prospects in college base
ball. Runyan went 10-1 last season
and hopes to continue that success
