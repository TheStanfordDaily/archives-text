### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's traditionally a home-and
home setup, with Fresno State and
Stanford alternating home series
each year.
However, due to delays in ren
ovations to Sunken Diamond last
year, the Cardinal missed its turn
to host the Bulldogs. So for the
third consecutive season, Stanford
must travel to Fresno to take on
Bob Bennett's squad in front of
one of the most hostile crowds in
collegiate baseball.
Over the past two seasons, Stan
ford has won four of five at Beiden
Field, a venue that former Cardi
nal star Joe Borchard, dripping
with sarcasm, once called "a really
nice family environment."
