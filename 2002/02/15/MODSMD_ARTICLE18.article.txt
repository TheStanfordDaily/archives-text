## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
The crowd chanted, the
floorboards shook, and the
players screamed.
For the first time this year, the
Maples faithful had a competitive
game to watch, at least for the first
half. Then, fueled by the home
team support, the No. 2 Cardinal
finally took control, winning the
game, 81-65.
Since Stanford's loss to Ten
nessee on Dec. 16, the Cardinal
has outscored its opponents at
home by an average of 21 points.
By halftime, games have been
foregone conclusions as Pacific
10 Conference opponents have
looked outmatched in every facet
of the game.
Last night, Washington (15-9,
10-5 Pac-10) looked like it was
going to force the Cardinal to
work down the stretch. At half
time, Stanford led by a mere five
points as the Huskies made the
Cardinal fight for all of its bas
kets. The two teams went almost
basket for basket as neither team
could get more than a nine
point edge. Every time the Car
dinal made a run, the Huskies
would respond, keeping the
game close and sometimes even
taking the lead.
It was evident from the very
beginning that this would be an
impassioned battle. In the first 90
seconds, the Cardinal scored
three quick buckets as senior cen
ter Bethany Donaphin pounded
it inside. The Huskies called a
timeout to try to halt the Cardinal
momentum, but already the
crowd was in the game, rooting
on the home team.
Donaphin's intensity soon
spread not only to her team
mates, but also through the en
tire Pavilion. With 10:26 remain
ing in the first half, sophomore

forward Nicole Powell passed to
a cutting Donaphin, who quickly
turned and laid in the lay-up de
spite being fouled. Turning to
Powell, Donaphin screamedVith
joy as the crowd erupted.
"I was open, and Nicole found
me." Donaphin said. "I was in
the right place at the right time."
A few minutes later, with the
Huskies down by six, senior re
serve Enjoli Izidor grabbed an of
fensive rebound and put it back
up for two while being fouled.
Again, the crowd rose to its feet,
cheering on the squad. For the
first time in conference play, the
crowd was a factor, increasing the
home-court advantage.
The Cardinal could easily
have relaxed under the pressure.
They only needed to win one
game out of four to clinch the
Pac-10 title with league-worst
Washington State (2-23, 0-15)
coming to Maples on Saturday.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal
(25-1, 15-0) refused to lose, with
standing Washington's offensive
force in the first half.
In the second half, the team
used the crowd's intensity to take
over, dominating the Huskies.
Powell was the might behind the
Cardinal surge, finishing the
game with a triple-double.
As the Cardinal pulled away,
the fans didn't drop in their in
tensity, cheering until the end.
With 5:05 remaining and the
team up 18 points, Donaphin
blocked a Husky shot into the
seats. Maples Pavilion exploded
as the fans stood to their feet.
With her teammates screaming
from the sidelines, Donaphin's
smile was clear from every seat in
the building.
While Saturday's game is the
last regular-season contest at
Maples, the Cardinal's home
