# Card crushes Huskies

SEATTLE — Here are six lasting impres
sions from the Cardinal's 91 -65 victory over
Washington last night:
First, it seems like nobody in the confer
ence can stop Curtis Borchardt.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Thursday: No. 12 Stanford 91,
Washington 65

The junior center picked up his fifth
straight double-double and his 11th of the
season with 15 points and 16 rebounds in
front of his home crowd. A native of Red
mond, Wash., Borchardt pounded on Husky
center David Dixon the entire night and
dominated the key.
" I try to work as hard as I can to try to give
the team a boost and I think I did that
tonight," said Borchardt, who was hounded
by a group of friends and family after the
game.
Secondly, Thursday nights are becoming
junior guard Casey Jacobsen's time to shine.
The Apple State — actually, it's the Ever
green State—might have been home to Bor
chardt, Tyler Besecker and Teyo Johnson,
but Thursday nights have certainly put Ja
cobsen in the spotlight the past few weeks.
Two weeks after tallying 49 points against
Arizona State, and a week after scoring 41 in

Stanford's overtime victory over Oregon, Ja
cobsen finished with 31 points on 9-of-19
shooting in front of 6,562 at the Bank of
America Arena.
"I really don't think about it much, but
maybe I night be more rested," Jacobsen
said of his stellar performances on Thursday
nights. "But I'm going to try and end that
streak of subpar games on Saturday with
solid back-to-back games."
Third, this wasn't a regular season football
game at Husky Stadium or the Seatde Bowl at
Safeco Field, but the sophomore forward
Johnson finally left Seattle with a win.
Johnson, a wide receiver for the Cardinal
football team, had twice left the Emerald City
on the losing end ofacontest this year in a 42-
28 loss to the Huskies and a 24-14 defeat to
Georgia Tech on Dec. 27.
This time, though, he finally earned
bragging rights.
"I took this game as a business trip, but it'll
be great to come home this summer and not
listening to remarks from my friends. It's
comforting," said Johnson, who finished with
nine points and seven rebounds.
Fourth, the reserves have been stepping
up big time for the Cardinal, and Thursday
night was no exception.
Freshman point guard Chris Hernandez
gave Stanford a boost of energy when Tony
Giovacchini was sidelined with foul trouble.
