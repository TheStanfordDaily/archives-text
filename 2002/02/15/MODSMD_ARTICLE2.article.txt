### MELISANDE MIDDLETON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford's 25th annual Viennese Hall is coining up
on March 1. This year it will be held at The Fairmont
San Jose, from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Many students look forward to the event and see it as
a unique opportunity to have fun in an elegant setting.
"What I like best about Viennese Ball is the fact
that it provides a nice, elegant atmosphere for people
to spend time with all their friends," said senior An
swol Hu, who is co-chair of the Viennese BaliPrga
nizing Committee. "It is very exciting to get all
dressed up and go out fora nice dinner and an
evening of dancing."
In planning the Ball this year, special attention was
given to its 25th anniversary.
"This year is the 25th anniversary so we're defi
nitely trying to pull out all the stops and make the Ball
really special," said senior Walter Shen, also co-chair
of the event's committee.
"The wait/ floor will be about 2000 square feet
larger and the swing floor will be about 1000 square
feet larger than last year," Hu said. "This will proba
bly be the largest Stanford Viennese Ball in history."
"Additionally, we're inviting several more Hon-

ored Guests this
year, including
several of the peo
ple who originally
started the Ball,"
Shen said.
Stanford's Vien
nese Ball tradition
began in 1977,
when stndents
from the Stanford
in-Austria program
attended carnival
or Fasching balls in
Vienna. When they
got back to Stan-

ford, they tried to imitate the event.
"Today, the Viennese Ball has become an elegant,
prestigious and much-anticipated social affair for the
Stanford community," Shen said.
The week preceding Viennese Ball is called "Aus
tria Week," featuring a series of on-campus festivities
including speakers, Austrian delicacies, films and
dance lessons and culminating with the Ball.
"The beautiful gala itself commences with waltz
and ballet performances during the Opening Cere
monies, after which guests dance for hours to waltzes,
polkas and big band music," Shen said.
In addition, late-in-the-night performances will
include Stanford dance groups such as Vintage,
