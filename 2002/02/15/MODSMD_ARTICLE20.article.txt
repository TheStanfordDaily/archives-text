## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
There are few things more daunting fora
sports team than having to travel to take on a
team that just lost for the first time in two years.
The No. 56 UNLV women's tennis team
(3-0) will do just that this Friday at 1:30 p.m.
when it comes to Stanford to take on the No.
3 Cardinal (5-1).
The Stanford women will look to put to rest
any questions about its vitality after a 4-3 loss
to then-No. 5 Georgia at the National Team
Indoors in Madison, Wis., last weekend. With
the win, the Bulldogs took the No. I ranking
this week that Stanford had held all season.

"It's important, especially coming off a loss,"
said sophomore Emilia Anderson. "[The loss] is
definitely going to motivate us."
One thing that could make a big difference
for the Cardinal is the expected return of the
team's top player, Lauren Kalvaria.
For the past few weeks, Kalvaria has been
unable to play singles and has moved down to
third-flight doubles due to injury. However,
she's feeling better and hopes to return to sin

gles action against UNLV.
"Just her being in the lineup gives you confi
dence," Anderson said.
Kalvaria is nation's N0.4 singles player and,
with senior Gabriela a, forms the country's
top doubles team.
Kalvaria and Lastra will have to be on their
game this Friday to hand UNLV its first loss of
the year.
The Rebels lost to Stanford 7-0 last
year in Las Vegas en route to a lackluster 11-12
finish. But by all accounts, UNLV is much im
proved this year, led by No. 59 Paulina Janus
and boasting three strong doubles teams.
However, they have not faced
any top-flight competition yet this
year, having only faced Nevada-
Reno, New Mexico State, and
Weber State.
While Janus is UNLV's only
ranked player, Stanford has five
ranked singles players: No. 4
Kalvaria, No. 10 freshman Erin
Burdette, No. 11 Lastra, No. 42
sophomore Lauren Barnikow
and No. 52 senior Keiko Toku
da. The Cardinal also has two
ranked doubles teams in No. 1
Kalvaria / Lastra and No. 6
Barnikow / Burdette.
Although the loss to Georgia
was tough, the Cardinal re
mains very positive as it contin
ues its defense of its NCAA
championship.
"If one loss breaks your confi
dence as a team, you've got a long
way to go," Anderson said. "Re
gardless of how we did last week,
the bulk of the season is still be
fore us."
"I really hope that we're just
going to come out banging,"
Tokuda said.
