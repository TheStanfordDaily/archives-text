There are few things more daunting fora
sports team than having to travel to take on a
team that just lost for the first time in two years.
The No. 56 UNLV women's tennis team
(3-0) will do just that this Friday at 1:30 p.m.
when it comes to Stanford to take on the No.
3 Cardinal (5-1).
The Stanford women will look to put to rest
any questions about its vitality after a 4-3 loss
to then-No. 5 Georgia at the National Team
Indoors in Madison, Wis., last weekend. With
the win, the Bulldogs took the No. I ranking
this week that Stanford had held all season.

Today: No. 3 Stanford vs. No. 56 UNLV,

"It's important, especially coming off a loss,"
said sophomore Emilia Anderson. "[The loss] is
definitely going to motivate us."
One thing that could make a big difference
for the Cardinal is the expected return of the
team's top player, Lauren Kalvaria.
For the past few weeks, Kalvaria has been
unable to play singles and has moved down to
third-flight doubles due to injury. However,
she's feeling better and hopes to return to sin

gles action against UNLV.
"Just her being in the lineup gives you confi
dence," Anderson said.
Kalvaria is nation's N0.4 singles player and,
with senior Gabriela a, forms the country's
top doubles team.
Kalvaria and Lastra will have to be on their
game this Friday to hand UNLV its first loss of
the year.
The Rebels lost to Stanford 7-0 last
year in Las Vegas en route to a lackluster 11-12
finish. But by all accounts, UNLV is much im
proved this year, led by No. 59 Paulina Janus
and boasting three strong doubles teams.
