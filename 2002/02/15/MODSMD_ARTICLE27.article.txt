##

David had it easy against Goliath.
For the Cardinal men's gymnastics team,
beating a team that hasn't lost a match in more
than two years figures to be a much harder task.
Opening its dual meet season against No. 9
California tonight, the Cardinal faces a squad
that hasn't lost a meet in its past 30 and finished
third at nationals last year.

For Stanford, the key to stopping the Cal jug
gernaut lies in putting out a consistent effort
throughout the six events while maintaining a
strong intensity level.
"Consistency is the main key," said senior
co-captain Rico Andrade. "This sounds weird,
but we plan on being tired for Friday's meet
because [head coach Sadao Hamada] will
make us do many routines on Thursday. We
might be tired this meet, but the tough compe
tition conditions will pay off'in the postseason."
In its last matchup with Cal just three weeks
ago, the Cardinal remained close to the Golden
Bears throughout the meet until the final two
events, the high bar and parallel bars.
"Team-wise our weakest and strongest
event is the high-bar," Andrade said. "I think
the number of releases we catch will deter
mine the meet."
Another concern that the team hopes to
begin to address on Friday is its start values,
the maximum scores the gymnasts can re
ceive for each event based on the difficulty of
their routines.
Cal couldn't be in a better position coming
into this meet, having notched three straight

wins. I n addition to their victory over the Car
dinal, the Golden Bears have picked up two
wins over UC-Santa Barbara in the last
month.
Led by Cody Moore, who made the U.S.
National Team last weekend, and two-time
defending NCAA champion Michael Ashe,
Cal is considered one of the of top teams in
the country.
The strongest asset the Cardinal will have,
against the Bears will be junior Marshall
Erwin on the rings. Erwin, who earned sec

ond place at the Winter Cup last weekend in
Las Vegas, took first place on that event when
he last faced Cal.
Now having their first collegiate competition
under their belts, the freshman triumvirate of
Kelly Lang, Daniel Torres-Rengel and Bryan
McColgan will also look to provide a boost to
the team.
"Our priorities are set, and Sadao and [assis
tant coach Thom Glielmi] have told us exactly
what we have to do to improve," Andrade said.
"It is up to us to follow through with their plan."
