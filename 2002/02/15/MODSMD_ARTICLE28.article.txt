### JERRY LU 
Even after incredible changes, sometimes follow
ing routine is best.
Coming off the team's heroic 12th title last Sunday
at the USTA/ITA National Team Indoors in
Louisville, Ky., tomorrow's home match against Fres
no State should be familiar territory. The Cardinal has
as a 9-0 all-time record against the Bulldogs.

MEN'S TENNIS
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 44 Fresno State,
12:00 p.m., Taube Family Tennis Stadium
Stanford takes on Fresno State at noon tomorrow
at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The match against Fresno State should be a wel
come breather for the men's team. During last week's
National Team Indoors, the Cardinal had to succes
sively play four competitive schools. The matches
against San Diego State, No. 9 Duke, No. 12 Southern
California, and finally against No. 6 Illinois in the finals
were fiercely fought.

Before that, Stanford defeated San Diego State, 6-
1, on February 2.
Fresno State may have some surprises up its sleeve,
however. The Bulldogs are coming off a back-to-back
home-opener sweep of Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
Nevada last Sunday in which the Bulldogs handily de
feated the two schools without dropping a match.
Fresno State (2-2) is in a rebuilding year, having
hired former Arizona women's tennis coach Brad
Dancer as the new head coach this season. Anchoring
the young team is senior Nick Fustar, a Cupertino na
tive who upset No. 13 Marcin Matkowski of UCLA
during the 6-1 Bulldog loss to the Bruins.
This season, the Cardinal boasts a tested, mature
team. ITA No. 1 senior K.J. Hippensteel (10-0)
proved his top ranking last week by winning every
match during the tournament. In addition, the No. 7
doubles team of Hippensteel and junior Ryan Havi
land also posted a 4-0 record.
Three juniors, No. 31 Scott Lipsky, No. 43 Haviland,
and No. 49 David Martin, provide a solid anchor for the
team. Also watch out for the NO. 3 doubles team of Lip
sky/Martin (13-3) who won 3-of-4 during t he Indoors.
