The average Stanford stu
dent's experience with the Can
tor Center for the Visual Arts be
gins and ends with a walk
through the Rodin Sculpture
Garden during Admit Weekend
or a visit to "The Gates of Hell"
for an I HUM section. Yet few re
alize both the extent and the
quality of the museum's re
sources offered to students and
the surrounding community.
"We have recently been put in
the same category as the San Fran
cisco Museum of Modern Art and
the San Jose Museum of Art by
museum focus groups," said Anna
Koster, public relations manager
for the museum.
Its permanent collection in
cludes African art, art of the an
cient Mediterranean, photogra
phy and contemporary art. The
collection continues to expand, ac
cording to museum officials.
"Last year we added 250 pieces
to the collection, and are usually
adding up to 300 pieces a year,"
Koster said.
One of the most important

new additions to the permanent
collection is a six-foot sculpture
by Robert Arneson, "Global
Death and Destruction." The ce
ramic statue is a protest against
nuclear war.
The museum also showcases
temporary exhibits. Currently
there are exhibits featuring the art
of Yvonne Jacquette, prints by
Frank Stella and woodblock prints
by Hiroshi Yoshida.
Originally named The Leland
Stanford Junior Museum, the mu
seum opened in 1884 only three
years after the founding of the
University. The 1906 earthquake
destroyed over two-thirds of its
collection. Following the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake, the mu
seum once again sustained consid
erable damage and was closed for
renovation and expansion until
January 1999.
Its reopening was accompa
nied by a new name — The Iris &
B. Gerald Cantor Center for Vi
sual Arts.
"The Cantors came forward at a
critical time," said Koster, "and do
nated $1 million on top of 185
pieces by Rodin."
The Rodin collection remains
one the highlights of the museum.
Another special feature is the Gold
Spike, which was used by railroad
owner Leland Stanford as the final
piece in connecting the first
transcontinental railroad at Pro
motory Point, Utah.
Those less interested in art
can enjoy the cafe, which serves
drinks, soups, salads and sand
wiches. There is also a book shop
affiliated with the Stanford
Bookstore, which sells books,
gifts and jewelry.
For those in search of ways to
spend a romantic evening, the
museum and cafe are open until
8 p.m.
Free docent-led public tours of
the museum, the Rodin Sculpture
Garden and Memorial Church are
offered weekly.
