# Who the hell is Jack Johnson?
## 
### MIKEY LEE JOY CHEN 
A few hundred people packed into Dinkelspiel Audi
torium on Monday night, oblivious to the fact that on the
night before, Jack Johnson had filled Santa Clara Uni
versity's Leavey Activity Center to the brim with thou
sands. Never mind that he had consecutive sold out
shows to play at the Fillmore the next couple of days.
There he was, clad in a simple red t-shirt and Reef san
dals, shyly approaching the mic before anyone had in
troduced him: "Hi, everyone. I'm Jack." The audience
went wild as he introduced "Thicker Than Water," his
highly acclaimed surfing documentary film.
Johnson, 26, graduated from UC-Santa Barbara with
a degree in film. The storv, however, started long before
that. Son of Hawaiian surf legend Jeff Johnson, Jack
grew up on the waves, and had a pro surfing contract
with Quicksilver when he was 16. Within a year, he made
it all the way to the prestigious Pipeline Masters as the
youngest finalist ever.
His rising surfing career took a literal nosedive when
he face-planted into a reef at 17. The accident left him
with 150 stitches on and around his face. Though he still
surfs, the incident was a transition to different interests.
While creating "Thicker Than Water," Surfing Maga
zine's Video of the Year in 2000, Johnson found his mu
sical voice.
By chance, he met up with Garrett Dutton of G. Love
& Special Sauce, who liked Johnson's "Rodeo Clowns" so
much that he convinced Johnson to record it on his 1999
release "Philadelphonic." When "Clowns" became the
album's only hit, major labels began to pursue Johnson.
Johnson quietly signed with tiny Enjoy Records in
stead, and continued his humble approach to his music,

of which he said in the Sept. 17, 2001 issue of Time mag
azine, "[Where I grew up] has always been just some guys
sitting around, not really on a stage or anything, but just
playing down at the corner of the yard at a luau or bar
beque. It's not very flashy."
He brought that attitude with him to Dink, where
most in the crowd had waited two hours in line on an
early morning just to get tickets.
The movie ended and Mason Jennings, a rising artist
from Minnesota, and Johnson's opener, played bouncy,
emotional licks that were catchy enough to get the
crowd moving.
Johnson soon ttx)k the stage and jumped right in with
"Posters," the third track on his newest release, "Brushfire
Fairytales." He alternated between originals and covers of
Bob Dylan and Bob Marley. His cover of Sublime's "Garden
Grove" led into other crowd favorites like "Bubbletoes," a
song written about his wife, Kim.
The audience loudly sang along to "Sexy Plexi," "Inaudi
ble Melodies," and finally to "Flake," Johnson's first single.
His encore was even more impressive than the
show itself.
Complaining that he felt too far removed from the
crowd, Johnson decided to move up to the front of the
stage with just his guitar, sans amplification, and without
his band. The crowd remained dead-silent as he sang
"Frankie and Albert," a Bob Dylan cover, in the soft
voice that conveyed his surfer-style so well.
He moved about the stage to please the screaming
fans and played through "Gone," an unreleased original
song; "Pirate Looks at 40," a Jimmy Buffett cover; and
"The News," a beautiful ballad about a mother's com
forting words to her child about the pain reported on
the news.

The show came to a close as Mason Jennings joined
Johnson for the last two songs. A shy wave by both artists,
and Johnson ran across the stage giving high-fives, grin
ning a modest half-smile of thanks.


Jack's publicist said forbade photos of Jack. What a prima donna.
