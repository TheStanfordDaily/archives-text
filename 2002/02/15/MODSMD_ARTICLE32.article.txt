# 'To Hell with Love' and Self-Help
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Most people realize
that art, in the Inroad
sense of the word, can
have a profoundly
cathartic effect. 1 can
personally attest that
reading and rereading
Dan Clowes' "Ghost
World" has brought me
back time and again

from the brink of driving a sharp, pointy
stick into someone's eye. Attempting to
harness the healing power of poetry, Mary
I). Esselman and Elizabeth Ash Velez have
assembled over 50 poems ostensibly about
love gone bad into a cute self-help volume,
"To Hell With Love: Poems to Mend a Bro
ken Heart."
The book is divided into eight sections,
intended to roughly outline the emotional
states yon go through after a break up —
"Rage," "Sadness," "Self-Hatred," "False
Hope," "Resolve," "Relapse," "Real Hope"
and "Moving On." Each section begins
with a not-so-brief introduction from the
editors, dishing out advice and self-help
platitudes, as well as brief descriptions of
each of the poems.
The problem with "The Hell With
Love," at least as a self-help book, is that
the poems usually resist, often fiercely, the
categories and interpretations that the ed
itors impose on them. For example, the
placing of Elizabeth Bishop's "One Art" in

"Resolve" feels almost completely arbi
trary, since it would have been equally at

home in "Sadness"
or "Self-Hatred."
More important
ly, like most
poems, the poetry
here remains slip
pery and difficult
to pin down. To try
to draw the same
pat lessons from

the soliloquies of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth"
as the editors do feels severely limiting.
Only rarely do the poems comfort and in
struct in the exact way that Esselman and
Velez say that they intend.
Nor is the editorial commentary partic
ularly useful. Esselman and Velez write in
broad, vague homilies about accepting
who you are and moving on with your life.
"Nourishing yourself (body and soul) is the
best way to 'begin again the story of your
life,'" they instruct, and while they may be
right, it's hard to imagine anyone in the
depths of depression finding their words
particularly insightful or persuasive.
Their pseudo-personal style begins to
cloy after a while, especially since displays
of wit such as, "And then being able to an
swer, 1 AM BETTER AND THE WORLD
DOESN'T SUCK!" are all too rare.
I'm not saying that it's impossible to
find any solace whatsoever in this book.
I'm just skeptical that any one volume can
hope to tome even close to serving as a

one-size-fits-all medication for mending
broken hearts. You may find a poem in
here that truly speaks to you when you're
experiencing the dark side of Valentine's
Day, but then again, you may not. You're
no more likely to find that poem in here
than in any other, non-self-help anthology
of love poetry.
While "The Hell With Love" is, at best,
unreliable as self-help, it is at least a decent
collection of poems. My favorites are, per
haps unsurprisingly, the two bits from
Shakespeare — Hamlet's "O! that this too
too sullied flesh would melt," and Mac
beth's "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and to-

morrow," — both
of which convey a
deep despair that's
not limited to mat
ters of romance.
The strongest
chapter is probably
"Moving On," be
cause it is here that
the editors are the
least stringent in
their self-help se
lection basis and
simply choose
poems that they
like, as long as
they're happy. This
opens the door to a
wide range of good
stuff, from Billy
Collins' "Morning,"

with its description of the joys of "buzzing
around the house on espresso," to Anne
McNaughton's ode to the testicles, "Teste
Moanial." Surprisingly, the "Rage" section
is fairly weak, probably because only the
First two poems — Margaret Atwood's
"you fit into me" and Michael Fried's
"Somewhere A Seed" — are the nasty, bile
filled kiss-offs that I hoped for.
So although I like some of the poems in
"The Hell With Love," I doubt that the
book will be particularly useful the next
time a girl rips my still-beating heart out.
But I'm keeping a copy on my shelf. Just
in case.

I'm not saying that it's impossible to
find any solace whatsoever in this book.
I'm just skeptical that any one volume can
hope to tome even close to serving as a

one-size-fits-all medication for mending
broken hearts. You may find a poem in
here that truly speaks to you when you're
experiencing the dark side of Valentine's
Day, but then again, you may not. You're
no more likely to find that poem in here
than in any other, non-self-help anthology
of love poetry.
While "The Hell With Love" is, at best,
unreliable as self-help, it is at least a decent
collection of poems. My favorites are, per
haps unsurprisingly, the two bits from
Shakespeare — Hamlet's "O! that this too
too sullied flesh would melt," and Mac
beth's "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and to-

morrow," — both
of which convey a
deep despair that's
not limited to mat
ters of romance.
The strongest
chapter is probably
"Moving On," be
cause it is here that
the editors are the
least stringent in
their self-help se
lection basis and
simply choose
poems that they
like, as long as
they're happy. This
opens the door to a
wide range of good
stuff, from Billy
Collins' "Morning,"

with its description of the joys of "buzzing
around the house on espresso," to Anne
McNaughton's ode to the testicles, "Teste
Moanial." Surprisingly, the "Rage" section
is fairly weak, probably because only the
First two poems — Margaret Atwood's
"you fit into me" and Michael Fried's
"Somewhere A Seed" — are the nasty, bile
filled kiss-offs that I hoped for.
So although I like some of the poems in
"The Hell With Love," I doubt that the
book will be particularly useful the next
time a girl rips my still-beating heart out.
But I'm keeping a copy on my shelf. Just
in case.


"Come on, dearest Guinevere, let me stick it in."
Most people realize
that art, in the Inroad
sense of the word, can
have a profoundly
cathartic effect. 1 can
personally attest that
reading and rereading
Dan Clowes' "Ghost
World" has brought me
back time and again

from the brink of driving a sharp, pointy
stick into someone's eye. Attempting to
harness the healing power of poetry, Mary
I). Esselman and Elizabeth Ash Velez have
assembled over 50 poems ostensibly about
love gone bad into a cute self-help volume,
"To Hell With Love: Poems to Mend a Bro
ken Heart."
The book is divided into eight sections,
intended to roughly outline the emotional
states yon go through after a break up —
"Rage," "Sadness," "Self-Hatred," "False
Hope," "Resolve," "Relapse," "Real Hope"
and "Moving On." Each section begins
with a not-so-brief introduction from the
editors, dishing out advice and self-help
platitudes, as well as brief descriptions of
each of the poems.
The problem with "The Hell With
Love," at least as a self-help book, is that
the poems usually resist, often fiercely, the
categories and interpretations that the ed
itors impose on them. For example, the
placing of Elizabeth Bishop's "One Art" in

"Resolve" feels almost completely arbi
trary, since it would have been equally at

home in "Sadness"
or "Self-Hatred."
More important
ly, like most
poems, the poetry
here remains slip
pery and difficult
to pin down. To try
to draw the same
pat lessons from

the soliloquies of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth"
as the editors do feels severely limiting.
Only rarely do the poems comfort and in
struct in the exact way that Esselman and
Velez say that they intend.
Nor is the editorial commentary partic
ularly useful. Esselman and Velez write in
broad, vague homilies about accepting
who you are and moving on with your life.
"Nourishing yourself (body and soul) is the
best way to 'begin again the story of your
life,'" they instruct, and while they may be
right, it's hard to imagine anyone in the
depths of depression finding their words
particularly insightful or persuasive.
Their pseudo-personal style begins to
cloy after a while, especially since displays
of wit such as, "And then being able to an
swer, 1 AM BETTER AND THE WORLD
DOESN'T SUCK!" are all too rare.

find any solace whatsoever in this book.
