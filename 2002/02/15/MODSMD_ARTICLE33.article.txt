# 'Less is more' for Sevendust
## 
### STEPHEN VIGIL 
Modern rock radio has gotten
heavier and heavier in recent
years. However, when Atlanta
based band Sevendust released
its debut album in 1997, metal
had not permeated the main
stream as much as it has now.

The band's self-titled album produced just
one radio hit, "Black," a dark, forceful tune
full of rage and aggression.
Since then, the band has released one
other album and although both CDs went
gold, the band came back broke both

times. Meanwhile, it has endured grueling
tours, drug addictions and sparsely-at-

tended concerts.
Almost three
years since Sevendust's
last release, "Home," the
band has had time to re
flect upon its trials and
tribulations. Its latest re-

lease, "Animosity," is a synthesis of these ex
periences — representing a slight change of
course for the group. As drummer Morgan
Rose explains, "We realized we didn't have to
try to be the heaviest band in the world."
Sevendust wants to push the bounds of
metal and write what Witherspoon calls "real
songs." Just how that will be done remains
quite unclear. Can the creative bounds of
metal be pushed? When Metallica re
emerged in the mid-'9os with new hairstyles
and a new sound, longtime fans wrote them
off as sell-outs. However, Sevendust has been
careful not to make that mistake. They have
tried to stay within the metal framework, only
sacrificing heaviness to a degree. The result is
a traversal of dark and gothic waters.
fhe new songs are ripe with religious im
agery with such titles as "Crucified" and "X
-mas day." These images, however, aren't in
tended to be uplifting in the way that U2
uses religion in its songs. Rather, the lyrics
lament the difference between reality and
self-delusion, musing on self-hatred and the
hatred of others.
Any metal fan will be pleased with "Ani-

mosity." Al
though at
times, some of
the songs
seem to run
together, their
sheer morbid
ity and dark
ness provoke
curiosity and
intrigue. For
the most part,
the album
stands on its
own, but there
are places it
seems remi
niscent of
Queensryche.
That aside,
two songs re
ally stand out
— the afore-

mentioned
"Crucified" and "X-mas Day."
"Crucified" is a sinister ballad interspersed
with the perfect mixture of crunching, heavy
metal guitar and angry, pensive vocals. The
song stirs up an image of an innocent fugitive
running from a bloodthirsty lynch mob.
"X-mas Day" is perhaps one of the best
songs on the album, but is also one of the
softest. Witherspoon's soft singing is almost
disturbing when one considers that the
song is about a loved one whose life has hit

rock bottom.
Musically, "Animosity" is not as hard-hit
ting as previous Sevendust albums — the
band has learned that sometimes, "less is
more." Witherspoon, for one thing, has ex
panded his vocal range and the songwriting
and music on this release are often thought
provoking. Indeed, Sevendust has set itself
apart from the host of metal bands out there
by developing musically without forgetting
its hard-rocking roots.

waters here."
