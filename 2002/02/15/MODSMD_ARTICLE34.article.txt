# Chambers shows twangy grit
## 
### JENNIE KIM 
Kasey Chambers wants you to know that there's more to
ihe Australian entertainment industry than Russell Crowe,
Nicole Kidman and a season of "Survivor."
The best musician to come from Down Under since
Frente, Chambers has already won two Australian Grammys

and now wants recognition on our shores. "Barricades and
Brickwalls" — which dips country into so many different
genres, it'll make your head spin — should earn her some
much-deserved attention.
The range displayed throughout the record's 13 songs
makes it refreshing to listen to and difficult to categorize.
Chambers cops an Ani Difranco-esque tune and message in
"Not Pretty Enough," a plaintive time about superficiality —
both personal and professional — in a world where Britney's
body gets more notice and her songs more radio play than
Chambers could shake a stick at.
In the unabashedly rootsy, "A Little Bit Lonesome," she's
Hank Williams and Emmylou I larris's country bumpkin love
child. And Lucinda Williams with a head cold never sounded
so good as Chambers's unintentional impression of her in"I
Still Pi;i\
"Barricades and Brickwalls" is a multi-layered experiment
of different styles, but each track retains a unique brand of
country-folk at its core — something that is clearly evident in
the twang, grit and depth of Chambers' voice.
Though she's sold more than 2 million albums in Australia,
this is a modest, unpretentious work. Kasey never lets you for
get that, really, she's just a down-home country girl.
At 25, Chambers walks the line between maturity and re
bellion. She boldly declares in "Crossfire," a two-minute char
acter rock riff, "Crossfire doesn't burn you / It only hurts when
it gets you hot /If you don't hate me, you'll learn to /1 thought
I had it clear from the start /1 don't have a heart."

Don't be too alarmed, though, as she does
have a heart, one that she lays bare on the very
next track. The highlight of the CD, "Falling
Into You," is a sparsely-orchestrated ode to the
inevitable fears that accompany the joys of being
in love — "Falling into you/It carries me far
enough away / And everything you do / It light-

ens up my darker side of day /1 just hope that the wind
doesn't blow you away."

Chambers strums her guitar solo
on the song, and. as on the rest of the
album, her voice takes center stage.
Thankfully, it's more than enough to get
her point across. With the overabun
dance of synthetic vocals that have taken
over the radio, Chambers' voice feels es
pecially authentic.


You know how much those Aussies know about country.


If you look really closely, you can see her nipples.
