# Pryor delivers neo-pop 'Vida'
## 
### JUNG LAH 
If heart-wrenching folk pop ain't your
thing, then do-not listen to "Para Toda
Vida," the second album from The New
Amsterdams. If, however, you have a need
to vicariously emote via acoustic ballads of
earnest longing, then look no further than
Matthew Pryor, for whom the band is a one
man effort. The New Amsterdams really ex
ists as a side-project of his full-time indie rock
gig The Get Up Kids.
Pryor's other side project, Reggie and the
Full Effect, takes The Get Up Kids' sound

and power-pops it for
maximum energetic and
melodic effect. The New
Amsterdams, on the other
hand, is more like taking
The Get-Up Kids' sound
and stripping it of all of its
half-stacks, instrument ef
fects, rock and roll nature
and the backing band.
And I mean that in a
good way.
Pryor's endeavors with
different bands all illus
trate the sphere of his mu
sical influence, but The

New Amsterdams represents Poor's solo
songwriting abilities in their most pure state.
T he result is impressive enough to match the
quality of his output in his other work, and
he maintains the standard set by 2000's

"Never You Mind,"
The New Amster
dams' first release.
That record bears
many similarities to
the new material,
which draws from a
neo-folk pop sensi-

bilitv that blends carefully crafted harmonies

with traditional song struc
ture and toned-down or
completely absent back
ground instrumentation.
Pryor performed alone
on all 10 tracks of "Para
Toda Vida" and wrote
eight of them. There are
two cover songs — "All
Ears" by Kill Creek and
"Forever Leaving," a song
by Tijuana Crime Scene,
which is another side
band made up ofThe Get
Up Kids members (but
not Pryor).

Para Toda Vida
Vagrant Records / He- (W
roes and Villains

The record begins with "My Old Man
Had A Pistol," immediately delving the lis
tener into Pryor-confessional-mode with re
frains like, "I pray take me far away from
everything that I am."

Things don't get cheerier: "Pic
ture In fhe Paper" compares bro
ken hearts with broken records,
while "Son Of A Prophet" ques
tions relationship criticism in the
context of explanation dismissal.
"Stay On The Phone" features
Pryor lamenting, "I want it all,"

which is interpreted into "I don't want to be
alone," and the song itself offers the kind of
right-on chord progression changes that
make you turn up the stereo to nod your
head melancholically yet firmly.
The album closes with "Losing You," a
song of urgency and loss whose bare quality
showcases Pryor's proficiency at crafting
heartbreak like a true champ. "All I can do is
quietly grin and resent you," he half-whis
pers, making one believe that it's almost
worth it to break up with a significant other
in order to produce songs and lyrics such as
these which are so painfully successful.
If there is a drawback to this album, it is
the fact that its songs sound fairly similar.
But Pryor is not claiming to be redefining

genres here. And with an album length
clocking in at under half an hour, repetitive
ness isn't really an issue. Feeling down? Get
this immediately. It probably won't make
you feel any better, but you might become
musically inspired nevertheless.


Dude . . . are those eyes?
