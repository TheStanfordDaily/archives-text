# 'Park' not your average mystery

"Gosford Park," directed by a 76-year-old but still sharp
Robert Altman, is a subtle and delightful genre-bending
satire that does for 1930's England what Altman's "The
Player" did for 1980's Hollywood. Ostensibly an English
drawing-room whodunit in the tradition of the classic board
game "Clue," the movie in fact centers around class divi
sions in English society, and the many torturous ways in
which such divisions are enforced and revealed.
"Gosford Park" is, however, infinitely more entertaining
than the humorless Marxist documentary suggested by that
brief synopsis.
Much of the fun of the film comes from watching the
finely-tuned interactions among a group of first class actors
and actresses. For his latest movie, Altman has assembled a
cast resembling an all-star team of current British perform
ers, including Kristen Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon,
Emily Watson and the inimitable stage acting veteran Dame
Maggie Smith. There are even a few well-cast Americans,

such as Bob Balaban (the dad from "Ghost World") and a
valiant but out-of-his-league Ryan Phillipe.
If you've ever read a book by Agatha Christie, you'll be
familiar with the outlines of the plot. Sir William and Lady

Sylvia McCordle (played wonderfully by
Gambon and Thomas respectively) in
vite a diverse group of relatives and
hangers-on to their estate fora weekend
shooting party.
Nearly all of the invitees bring maids
or manservants, swelling the already
numerous ranks of the servants at Gos
ford Park. Eventually, someone is mur-

dered and the obligatory pipe-smoking detective is sum
moned, but the murder mystery aspect of the movie is clear
ly not the main point.
Key plot developments relevant to the murder are deliv-

ered offhandedly and without buildup, and
Altman brilliantly underplays every crucial
moment, from the unmasking of the
killer(s?) to yet juicier revelations that would
have been the centerpiece of a lesser film.
Altman himself has declared, "This really
is not so much a whodunit as a 'why didn't
he do it before' or a 'who cares whodunit.'"
The director is far more interested in exam
ining the fault lines running through the
brittle crystalline social structure of the
manor. In a manner reminiscent of 1989's
"The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her
Lover," it is the often permeable barrier be
tween the "above stairs" aristocrats and the
"below stairs" servants that actually drives
the movie.
"Gosford Park" consists largely of lushly
detailed, often difficult to follow conversa
tional scenes, with many people speaking at
once. Altman bizarrely credits his uncon
ventional use of sound in the movie to the
fact that he has "narrow ear canals." The

care that was taken to build up this luxuriant exposition can
make it seem as if the ending of the movie, when the mur
der is hastily solved and several loose ends are brusquely
tied up, is rushed and a bit careless.

But of course this is an illusion
brought on by Altman's choice of genre.
The true climax, which comes long be
fore the solution to the largely irrele
vant mystery, occurs when the head
housemaid (Watson, who was the lumi
nous chess groupie in"The Luzhin De
fense") dares to speak to her mistress
while serving dinner.

In a tribute to the artistry with which the insular world of
the manor was constructed for the viewer, several members
of the supposedly egalitarian American (OK, Palo A1 tan) au
dience gasped audibly at her audacity.
