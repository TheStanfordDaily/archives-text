# A 						'Story' for angsty cinephiles
## 
### JOANNA PETRONE 
Uncap that bottle of Zoloft, dab some con
cealer on your scarred wrists and forgo what
little faith you may have left in humanity.
That's right, kids, Todd Solondz, writer / di
rector of "Happiness" and "Welcome to the
Dollhouse," has a new movie out. Like previ
ous Solondz flicks, "Storytelling" will leave
you feeling all warm and mushy inside — due
to rising bile, that is.
"Storytelling" is actually two separate nar
ratives. The first, titled "Fiction," is the story

of Vi's (Selma Blair) bizarre sexual encounter with Mr.
Scott (Robert Wisdom), the sadistic, Pulitzer-Prize-win
ning professor who is every creative writing student's
worst nightmare.
The scenes in the writing class are painfully well done.
That is, while you laugh at the trite stories and the bull
shit responses, you simultaneously cringe at the rawness
of the pain and humiliation virtually every character is
wrought with.
Solondz is a master at pushing the cruelty and the suf
fering of his characters just to the edge of comedy, to
where we hope to see them meld away into caricatures,
into grotesques so absurd we can comfortably laugh at
them. But he never lets us stay there for long before
snapping us back into emotional close-ups — the kinds
of things, in fact, that the writing students might call
cliche — that force the viewer to reconnect with that raw
suffering and take it seriously.
As one girl says after Marcus, Vi's cerebral-palsy-af
flicted boyfriend, has slurred his thinly veiled fiction
story, "All this earnestness is embarrassing." Solondz is
aggressive in his efforts to shock and disturb the viewer
by off-setting wry, understated humor with unmediat
ed pain, and by juxtaposing the intensity of what his
characters go through with the cool, detached lens

through which we are forced to
watch them squirm.
"Non-fiction," the second,
longer narrative, centers around
Toby, a middle-aged shoe salesman
and self-described documentarian,
and the family he is documenting,
the Livingstons. The Livingstons, a
wealthy Jewish family from New
Jersey, are chock full of all the sub
urban dysfunction, adolescent tor
ment and sexual trauma one ex
pects from Solondz.
Beyond that, "Storytelling" is
about the exploitation of life and of
women in the production of art,

and about the voyeurism and sadism of the artist. Se
quences like the one in which Vi discovers Mr. Scott's

photographs of other
girls from her writing
class, naked and tied
up, force the viewer to
confront the problem
atic relationship be
tween object and sub
ject in art. Vi's terror
and disgust are
matched only by her
inability to look away.

Vi, like the viewer, is both the sadistic voyeur who de
rives pleasure from looking at the images of degraded
and eroticized women, and the masochistic object of the
male gaze, for she identifies with the girls in the pho
tographs, knowing soon she will be in a similar position.
What Solondz seems to be getting at here is the es
sentially sadistic nature that you (that's right, you), the
viewer, derive from looking at movies or other works
of art. Solondz evokes brittle laughter from his audi
ence, yanks the humor away, then shoves those sharp,
reflective shards back in our faces. And, just as Vi does
when Mr. Scott tells her she has no potential to be a
writer, we are supposed to smile and say, "Thank you
for your honesty."
In "Non-fiction," Scooby Livingston, an adolescent
pothead whose life plan is to "get on TV," slips into the
screening room where clips from the documentary are
being shown. As he watches the audience laugh at the
wan and vacant-eyed image of himself, his eyes well
with tears.
You have two options in life, Solondz seems to be say
ing. You can be the idiot — the dumb, sentimental, fool
who never "gets it"and who is forever being laughed at.
Or you can be the sadist — the cool and detached voyeur
who does the laughing. Both options are repulsive.

Solondz's smugness and
the degree to which he
seems to grant himself ex
emption can also be sicken
ing. Some of the most dis
turbing scenes in the movie
are those between Mikey,
the youngest Livingston,
and Consuelo, the Liv
ingston's maid. The heavy
handed and obtuse effect
of the overly-calculated
camera angles (the camera
frequently tilts back to
show Mikey as an enor
mous white face looming
over Consuelo's dark,
hunched figure) does
nothing to alleviate the dis
gust one feels during these
excruciating moments.
While, on one hand, the

blatant display of racism, classism and sexism can be
viewed as an expose of the hidden violences in white,
well-mannered suburbia, Solondz subjects Consuelo and
other women to painful and humiliating postures and
tasks (in one scene Consuelo is on her hands and knees,
literally scraping shit off of the floor) so repeatedly and
so unrelentingly that one cannot help but suspect more
than a twinge of sadism and misogyny on the part of
Solondz towards the creatures who, by all humane stan
dards, deserve the most compassion.
But then, Todd Solondz is not humane, nor is he nice,
and "Storytelling" is not a movie for the faint of heart .
If, however, you happen to fall under the category of
angsty, misanthropic cinephile, not only are you near
and clear to my own heart, but yon will likely find "Sto
rytelling" to be worth your time, worth your money and,

yes, even worth your very substan
tial discomfort.
While I wouldn't call the movie
pleasurable, per se, it is interesting,
well-crafted and compelling. Let
me put it this way: despite the nau
sea, despite leaving my Ritalin at
home, drinking thtee cups of coffee
and not smoking a single cigarette
all day, I remained perfectly still for
ninety minutes, my ADD eyes fixed
on the screen, not even my hyper
active leg twitching.
Now, if you'll excuse me, 1 have
a stack of fiction writing that 1 need
to go burn.

But then, Todd Solondz is not humane, nor is he nice,
and "Storytelling" is not a movie for the faint of heart .
If, however, you happen to fall under the category of
angsty, misanthropic cinephile, not only are you near
and clear to my own heart, but yon will likely find "Sto
rytelling" to be worth your time, worth your money and,

yes, even worth your very substan
tial discomfort.
While I wouldn't call the movie
pleasurable, per se, it is interesting,
well-crafted and compelling. Let
me put it this way: despite the nau
sea, despite leaving my Ritalin at
home, drinking thtee cups of coffee
and not smoking a single cigarette
all day, I remained perfectly still for
ninety minutes, my ADD eyes fixed
on the screen, not even my hyper
active leg twitching.
Now, if you'll excuse me, 1 have
a stack of fiction writing that 1 need
to go burn.


"Children, I was just teaching your mother how to wrestle, that's all."


Both sadistic voyeur and
masochistic object of the
male gaze.
Uncap that bottle of Zoloft, dab some con
cealer on your scarred wrists and forgo what
little faith you may have left in humanity.
That's right, kids, Todd Solondz, writer / di
rector of "Happiness" and "Welcome to the
Dollhouse," has a new movie out. Like previ
ous Solondz flicks, "Storytelling" will leave
you feeling all warm and mushy inside — due
to rising bile, that is.
"Storytelling" is actually two separate nar
ratives. The first, titled "Fiction," is the story

of Vi's (Selma Blair) bizarre sexual encounter with Mr.
Scott (Robert Wisdom), the sadistic, Pulitzer-Prize-win
ning professor who is every creative writing student's
worst nightmare.
The scenes in the writing class are painfully well done.
That is, while you laugh at the trite stories and the bull
shit responses, you simultaneously cringe at the rawness
of the pain and humiliation virtually every character is
wrought with.
Solondz is a master at pushing the cruelty and the suf
fering of his characters just to the edge of comedy, to
where we hope to see them meld away into caricatures,
into grotesques so absurd we can comfortably laugh at
them. But he never lets us stay there for long before
snapping us back into emotional close-ups — the kinds
of things, in fact, that the writing students might call
cliche — that force the viewer to reconnect with that raw
suffering and take it seriously.
As one girl says after Marcus, Vi's cerebral-palsy-af
flicted boyfriend, has slurred his thinly veiled fiction
story, "All this earnestness is embarrassing." Solondz is
aggressive in his efforts to shock and disturb the viewer
by off-setting wry, understated humor with unmediat
ed pain, and by juxtaposing the intensity of what his
characters go through with the cool, detached lens

through which we are forced to
watch them squirm.
"Non-fiction," the second,
longer narrative, centers around
Toby, a middle-aged shoe salesman
and self-described documentarian,
and the family he is documenting,
the Livingstons. The Livingstons, a
wealthy Jewish family from New
Jersey, are chock full of all the sub
urban dysfunction, adolescent tor
ment and sexual trauma one ex
pects from Solondz.
Beyond that, "Storytelling" is
about the exploitation of life and of
women in the production of art,

and about the voyeurism and sadism of the artist. Se
quences like the one in which Vi discovers Mr. Scott's

photographs of other
girls from her writing
class, naked and tied
up, force the viewer to
confront the problem
atic relationship be
tween object and sub
ject in art. Vi's terror
and disgust are
matched only by her
inability to look away.

Vi, like the viewer, is both the sadistic voyeur who de
rives pleasure from looking at the images of degraded
and eroticized women, and the masochistic object of the
male gaze, for she identifies with the girls in the pho
tographs, knowing soon she will be in a similar position.
What Solondz seems to be getting at here is the es
sentially sadistic nature that you (that's right, you), the
viewer, derive from looking at movies or other works
of art. Solondz evokes brittle laughter from his audi
ence, yanks the humor away, then shoves those sharp,
reflective shards back in our faces. And, just as Vi does
when Mr. Scott tells her she has no potential to be a
writer, we are supposed to smile and say, "Thank you
for your honesty."
In "Non-fiction," Scooby Livingston, an adolescent
pothead whose life plan is to "get on TV," slips into the
screening room where clips from the documentary are
being shown. As he watches the audience laugh at the
wan and vacant-eyed image of himself, his eyes well
with tears.
You have two options in life, Solondz seems to be say
ing. You can be the idiot — the dumb, sentimental, fool
who never "gets it"and who is forever being laughed at.
Or you can be the sadist — the cool and detached voyeur
who does the laughing. Both options are repulsive.

Solondz's smugness and
the degree to which he
seems to grant himself ex
emption can also be sicken
ing. Some of the most dis
turbing scenes in the movie
are those between Mikey,
the youngest Livingston,
and Consuelo, the Liv
ingston's maid. The heavy
handed and obtuse effect
of the overly-calculated
camera angles (the camera
frequently tilts back to
show Mikey as an enor
mous white face looming
over Consuelo's dark,
hunched figure) does
nothing to alleviate the dis
gust one feels during these
excruciating moments.
While, on one hand, the

blatant display of racism, classism and sexism can be
viewed as an expose of the hidden violences in white,
well-mannered suburbia, Solondz subjects Consuelo and
other women to painful and humiliating postures and
tasks (in one scene Consuelo is on her hands and knees,
literally scraping shit off of the floor) so repeatedly and
so unrelentingly that one cannot help but suspect more
than a twinge of sadism and misogyny on the part of
Solondz towards the creatures who, by all humane stan
dards, deserve the most compassion.
But then, Todd Solondz is not humane, nor is he nice,
and "Storytelling" is not a movie for the faint of heart .
If, however, you happen to fall under the category of
angsty, misanthropic cinephile, not only are you near
