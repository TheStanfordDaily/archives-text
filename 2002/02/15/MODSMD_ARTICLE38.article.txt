# Roxy Sass Advises Chastity?!?
## 
### 
Dear Roxy,
My boyfriend and I have been together since
freshman year (we're juniors now). We are veiy
much in love wilh each other, and he is my veiy best
friend. And we are veiy committed to each other. We
are thinking about stalling to have sex (safe, of
course) because we think that making love will bring
us ei'en closer together. Neither of us feels ready for
marriage because I'm pre-med and he'spre-law and
we don't know where we'll end up. Any advice?

Dear Mary,
I understand the thoughts and feelings
going through your mind. You've managed
to make it two years without crossing the sex
ual Rubicon, and I, for one, think that's
something to be admired.
Since you have shown your respect for
each other and God for this long, I urge you
to really think about why you've held on to
your virginity, and what that means to you. I
believe you are very much in love, and that
your relationship is mature. And as you said,

you feel that making love will bring you
"even closer together." But before you make
this huge decision, let's consider it together.
I'm sure that you and your boyfriend are
very much in love, but though you say you
are "very committed" to each other, I don't
think that you are completely committed to
each other. Why do I think this? Well, you
told me.
By saying that you don't know where
you'll end up formed school or law school,
you're indicating that there are other things
that are more important than your relation
ship with him. What if you go to UCLA for
and he goes to Duke? If you are in a serious
ly committed relationship, your life with
your husband will be first on your mind and
vice versa.
Sex is best shared between married cou
ples where it is an expression of an unbreak
able, three-way commitment that you've
made with Him and your partner. It is a tan
gible part of love that lasts forever. It is the
security of such a commitment that allows
you to feel comfortable in sexual situations,
and it is this same security which fosters the
proper environment for raising children.

Also, you mention that if you do have sex,
it will be "safe." Please don't fool yourself into
thinking that any sex is safe. You may be
using protection against pregnancy and dis
ease, but the only contraceptive that is fool
proof is abstinence. Condoms break and are
only roughly 8,5 percent effective, and even
birth control pills fail 5 percent of the time.
Because you seem so unsure about the fu
ture, you should also think about how this
decision will affect your relationship with
whoever you eventually end up marrying. If
yon sleep with your current boyfriend, and
the changes that happen in the next few
years result in a breakup, you will come to
your eventual husband with a past. You will
have sexual memories of another partner. At
best, these memories will never go away. At
worst, you may find yourself comparing
your ex-boyfriend with your husband, and
I'm sure you can imagine the hurt and an
guish this will cause.
God's perspective is easily summarized
in 1 Corinthians 6:18-20. Your body is a
temple, and sex before marriage is a sin
against that temple. That said, please con
sider this decision carefully.
