# Chuck E. Don't Make No Sense
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
With a mixture of blues, Cajun, jazz and ragtime.
Chuck E. Weiss' latest album, "Old Souls & Wolf Tickets"
sounds like what Tom Waits might record if his producer
locked him in a Chuck E. Cheese ball pit fora month. In
fact Waits and Weiss are old friends, and the legendary

songwriter lends vocals and engineering
to a few of the tracks.
More accessible and more hilarious
than Waits, Weiss' songs often border on
children's music. Take track one, for ex
ample. The album's first sounds are
Weiss and his background singers trad-

l ing "Oh Hi Ays" and

"Doobadoobadoos." Quickly
Weiss demonstrates his lyrical mastery by rhyming
the "doos" with "My baby's got no clothes cause
she's making.chicken soup."
On any given song, Weiss' singing breaks down
into gibberish. After an increasingly inarticulate
verse in "Tony Did The Boogie Woogie," the song
writer sings, "Gonna play the boogie, boogie, boo
gie, boogie, boogie."
However, once past the nonsense, Weiss' Dix
ieland rhythm section will impress anyone who
drinks whiskey and water, perhaps inspiring some
to go bake a batch of cornbread.
Throughout the album, Weiss' arrangements are
difficult to resist. The songwriter varies between
stripped-down, guitar-led blues and New Orleans
style horn-heavy jamborees. The barroom bass
and smoky vocals stand out as the record's high
points, white Weiss' words sound as if he is mimic
king loving parents talking to a newborn.
While the music remains fun, "Old Souls &
Wolf Tickets" covers well-trodden ground. In
addition to Waits, music veterans will hear
echoes of Professor Longhair, Captain Beef
heart and even Louis Armstrong — all of whom
do it better than Weiss.
Still, if performed in a certain setting — after
hours at a crowded Slim's — this collection of
songs would send most audience members straight
to a record store.
A Los Angeles nightclub regular, Weiss has been
performing in the city since the mid-'7os. Actually,
Weiss and actor Johnny Depp co-founded the in
famous Viper Room, formerly the Central, a bar
where Weiss played a weekly gig.
Weiss received widespread publicity in 1979
when Rickie Lee Jones released the smash hit

"Chuck E's In Love" about the
teenage rocker.
However, the music world dis
covered Weiss well before Jones. As a
teen, the Denver native played
drums for legends like Lightnin
Hopkins, Muddy Waters, Roger
Miller and Willie Dixon. Dixon actu-

ally sings lead on "Down The Road A
Piece," the ninth track on "Old Souls & Wolf Tickets."
Despite nearly thirty years of music and ties to enter
tainment's elite, Weiss waited until 1997 to record his
debut, the critically acclaimed "Extremely Cool."
Out on Rykodisc Records, this sophomore release will
satisfy those who tune their radio dials to classic oldies as
well as those who still list the Cookie Monster as the great
est musical mind in the last 50 years. However if Dr. Dre
rings truer than Dr. John, pass this one by.
Weiss will play Slim's, located at 333 11th Street in San
Francisco, on Friday Feb. 22.


Chuck E. strokes the pussy.


"Gonna play the boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie."
