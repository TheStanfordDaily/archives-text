## 
### GEORGE TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Sanskriti cultural organi
zation and the Asia-Pacific Re
search Center will be hosting a
discussion on entrepreneurial
success, featuring guest speakers
Kanwal Rekhi and Kailash Joshi,
front 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. today at the
Asian American Activities Center
Clubhouse Ballroom in Old
Union.
Rekhi, founder and interna
tional president of The IndUS
Entrepreneurs, a not-for-profit
organization created for the ad
vancement of entrepreneurship,
and Joshi, president of the orga
nization's Silicon Valley office,
will lead a discussion titled,
"South Asian Success: Is It a Mat
ter of Money?"
Junior Shalin Mantri, the cul
tural co-chair of Sanskriti and

organizer of the discussion,
noted the appropriateness of tire
presenters.
"Rekhi and Joshi are very well
qualified to speak on the subject,"
Mantri said. " They are more than
mere money-makers . . . they
have a vision."
The speakers were recruited
through the efforts of Rafiq Ros
sani, senior research scholar at
the Asia-Pacific Research Center.
"I suggested names that were
relevant for the event and
played the networking role of
connecting Mantri with the
speakers," Donssani said.
The inspiration for the event
dates back to last year, when
Mantri received a controversial
e-mail from a group of South
Asian friends.
"This e-mail listed many finan
cially successful leaders of South
Asian origin ... but did not in
clude successful leaders such as
Mahatma Gandhi," Mantri said.
"A heated debate then ensued re
garding the validity of such a ma
terialistic notion of success."
Senior Rajen Oesai, co-presi
dent of Sanskriti, pointed out a
trend in career selection that
touches on this issue.
"Parents urge their children
to specialize in areas like cardio
vascular surgery or radiation on
cology simply because they think
more syllables mean more
salary," Desai said.
Today's discussion will specifi

cally address the topics of money
and success using the experiences
of Rekhi and Joshi.
"We want to know how suc
cessful South Asians in the Valley
define success," Dossani said. "Is
it just money or does satisfaction
come in other ways?"
Organizers of the event said
they expect a favorable turnout.
"I think it will be a full house,"
Dossani said. "I'he subject is a fas
cinating one and the speakers are
very apt."
Sophomore Sonia Nijjar, the
social chair of Sanskriti, explained
why she expects a large audience
for the two entrepreneurs.
"It is an amazing opportunity
for the Stanford community to
be able to meet these people
who are role models in so many
ways," she said.

In addition to hosting such
feature discussions, Sanskriti
holds weekly cultural meetings
on Fridays.
"Topics have ranged from
hate crimes against South Asians
and their portrayal in the media
to the AIDS crisis in South Asia,"
Mantri said.
Mantri said today's meeting in
tegrates into the overall mission
of Sanskriti.
"We started this school year
with three goals — to enrich
students with something they
never knew before, to immerse
them in South Asian culture and
to develop awareness about is
sues that pertain to all South
Asians," Mantri said. "I believe
students will strongly enjoy this
meeting precisely because it ful
fills these goals."
