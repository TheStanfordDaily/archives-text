### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford Medical Center
physician and her mother were
arraigned last Thursday on
charges of elder abuse, embezzle
ment and theft.
Santa Clara prosecutors ac
cused Cheryl Walker, -assistant
professor of gynecology and ob
stetrics and medical director of
Stanford Hospital's gynecology
clinic, of conspiring with her
mother Janice Walker to embez
zle $500,000 from Mary Lee Kole

also accused of conspiring to give
Koleber an overdose of drugs that
led to her death.
Koleber was Janice Walker's
mother and Cheryl Walker's
grandmother.
Prosecutors allege that Janice
and Cheryl Walker had been tak

own home.
In addition, a coroner's au
topsy found traces of morphine,
codeine, diltiazem — a drug

used to treat hypertension —
and the painkiller oxycodone in
Koleber's body. The amount of
oxycodone found in Koleber
was three to five times the thera
peutic level.
Prosecutors say that the combi
nation of drugs could have been
lethal, but a scientific link between
the drugs and her death would be
hard to prove.
The University has responded
with a press release from the Gen
eral Counsel's office saying, "The
University has reviewed the
charges that have been filed, and
those charges are unrelated to pa

tient care at Stanford Hospital
and Clinics."
General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt detailed the Universi
ty's response.
"She'sbeen placed on adminis

information and facts as to what
has actually happened, we will re
view the case and take any appro
priate action," Zumwalt said.
Medical Center officials em
phasized that the case lias not yet
