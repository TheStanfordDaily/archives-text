# Nobel Prize winner speaks about research
## 2001 award winner in Physics gives an amusing lecture 
### KRISTIN SCHLEICHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, a standing-room
only crowd packed the Bloch Au
ditorium of TCSEQ fora lecture
given by Eric Cornell, co-recipi
ent of the 2001 Nobel Prize in
Physics. Cornell, also a senior sci
entist with the National Institute
of Standards and Technology
and adjoint professor at the Uni
versity of Colorado-Boulder,
spoke on the topic of "Stone Cold
Science: Bose-Einstein Conden-'
sation and the Weird World of
Physics a Millionth of a Degree
From Absolute Zero."
Bose-Einstein condensation
refers to the behavior of gas mole
cules at extremely low tempera
tures, below those observed in
deep space and just above the
point at which all atomic motion
stops. When a gas is cooled to
these extreme conditions, the
atoms become less particle-like
and more wavelike in nature and
gather in the same energy state.
The resulting material, known as
the condensate, is small — often
less than a million individual
atoms — cold, only partially sta

ble, laser-like in many properties,
and gelatinous despite having
one-millionth the density of air.
It was for his successful pro
duction and observation of these
Bose-Einstein condensates that
Cornell, along with Carl Wieman
and Wolfgang Ketterle, was
awarded the Nobel Prize. Cornell
said he was eager to return to his
Colorado lab after the excitement
of his trip to Stockholm and the
attention brought by the Decem
ber announcement of the award.
"Being a Nobel Prize winner
was comparable to being Miss
America," quipped Cornell. "A
[whirlwind] year until the
crown is passed to the next
year's honoree."
Cornell engaged the audience
by peppering his speech with
everyday analogies. He first com
pared the process of laser cooling
(stopping atomic motion with
light) to "bouncing ping-pong
balls at a bowling ball to stop it,"
and explained the relative efficacy
of evaporative cooling with an
analogy to hot coffee.
"I enjoyed [Cornell's] sense of
humor," said Josh Sacks, who
came from Foster City to listen to
Cornell's talk. "He was entertain
ing and he seemed to really enjoy
what he was doing."
The audience laughed whole
