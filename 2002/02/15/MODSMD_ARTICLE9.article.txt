## 
### 
KARACHI, Pakistan (AF) —
A British-born militant with a
history of kidnapping Western
ers confessed yesterday to the ab
duction of Wall Street journal re
porter Daniel Pearl and, in a
chilling declaration, told a Pak
istani court he believes the jour
nalist is dead.
But President Pervez Mushar
raf and Karachi police ques
tioned his claim, and the Journal
said it is confident Pearl is still
alive.
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh
appeared in court for the first
time yesterday. Me gave no de
tails on where or when the 38-
year-old Wall Street Journal
journalist was allegedly killed.
Just a day earlier, police said he
had told them Pearl was still alive.
With his hands bound in thick
steel chains and a dirty shawl

draped over his head, Saeed
shuffled into an anti-terrorist
court surrounded by police in
bulletproof vests gripping auto
matic: rifles.
• Twice Saeed struggled to re
move the shawl from his head
and twice police put it back on.
Finally Judge Krshad Noor Khan
agreed to have it removed.
"I don't want to defend this
case. I did this," Saeed said in a
soft voice, barely a whisper at
times. "As far as 1 understand,
he's dead."
Grim-faced and looking
weary, Saeed told the court,
"Right or wrong, 1 had my rea
sons. I think that our country
shouldn't be catering to Ameri
ca's needs."
Saeed's unexpected statement
came a day after Musharraf met
President Bush in Washington to

receive kudos for Pakistan's sup
port in the war against terror.
Musharraf abandoned his long
time Taliban allies after the Sept.
11 attacks and lias moved to
crack down on Muslim extrem
ists who had long been tolerated
and even supported by previous
governments here.
Musharraf said his govern
ment does not believe Saeed's
claims about Pearl's death be
cause the suspect's been "saying
something one day and another
thing on the other day."
"1 hope and pray that he's
alive," Musharraf said after meet
ing with U.S. lawmakers in
Washington. Karachi police chief
Kamal Shah said investigators
had no evidence that Pearl was
dead apart from Saeed's state
ment and they did not believe
Saeed could be trusted.
