Hostage with High Interest Rates
It's not a pretty sight—and
millions of earthlings are at risk. The
disease: high interestitis.The symp
toms: high levels of anxiety and lower
account balances.
According to Rich R. Deneaux,
Ph.D. in Consumer Ripoffs.the
symptoms are usually slow to surface.
Dr. Deneaux attributes this to a sense
of euphoria that follows the acquisi
tion of a new automobile or new
home.
"There's a'honeymoon'period
with every high interest loan when
the consumer is so enamored by his
or her purchase that nothing else in
the world matters. Unfortunately, the
honeymoon ends too quickly and you
wake up next to a loan that is costing
you a fortune," says Deneaux.
So where does such a widespread
epidemic come from?
According to Deneaux, this is
"absolutely the work of aliens.Their
multi-step plan goes like this:
1) Drain the earthlings of their
resources.
2) Descend to earth offering relief.
3) Completely take over the world
and have the female aliens bear
Elvis' babies."
