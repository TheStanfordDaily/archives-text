# Bush visits South Korea

WASHINGTON (AP) —
President Bush's visit to South
Korea starting today likely
would be little more than a rou
tine show of support fora valued
ally were it not fora single sen
tence he included in his State of
the Union address.
The repercussions were felt
all the way to Seoul when Bush
said: "North Korea is a regime
arming with missiles and
weapons of mass destruction,
while starving its citizens."
Bush's words seemed to
clash with the four-year effort of
South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung to reach out to his
northern neighbor.
Kim believes that gestures of
friendship will build confidence
and reduce the prospects of an
other war.
Kim once said his North Ko
rean counterpart, Kim Jong 11,
should have shared the Nobel
Peace Prize that the South Kore
an leader won after their friend
ly summit meeting in Py
ongyang in 2000.
In contrast, Bush says the

Kim Jong-Il's government is
part of an exclusive "axis of evil"
together with Iran and Iraq.
Bush, whose Korea visit will
include a stop in the Demilita
rized Zone that separates the two
rivals, said Saturday he supports
South Korea's attempts to recon
cile with the North.
But, he added, America "will
not allow North Korea and
other dangerous regimes to
threaten freedom witlV*weapons
of mass destruction."
Pyongyang's export of mis
siles, primarily to Iran, is a major
administration concern. De
scribing North Korea's overall
missile sales program, National
Security adviser Gondoleezza
Rice said last week, "They're
stocking a lot of the world right
now."
But many in South Korea
worry that Bush's tough stand
could create instability on the
peninsula, no small matter con
sidering the vast military force
Pyongyang has deployed not
far from Seoul and its 15 mil
lion citizens.
