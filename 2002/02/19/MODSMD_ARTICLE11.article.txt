# Speaker addresses Palestine-Israel conflict
## 
### STEWART NIELSON 
With tensions in Israel and Palestine run
ning high, many scholars of the region have
said there is a more now a need than ever for
understanding the causes of conflict in the area.
Raja Shehadeh, a native Palestinian and schol
ar of Jewish-Arab relations, spoke about these
issues Friday to students and community mem
bers in the Lane History Corner.
" I wrote my memoirs to show [among other
things] how I got into human rights work,"
Shehadeh said.
He began his lecture by reading several se
lections from his memoirs, "Strangers in the
House: Coming of Age in Occupied Palestine."
Shehadeh described how an Israeli inter
rogator had been tried for torturing a confes
sion out of a Palestinian prisoner. The legal sys
tem was corrupt, he said, and did not ade
quately address the problem, so the torturing
continued.
"This is a metaphor for the entire conflict,"
Shehadeh said.
According to him, the problem is that most
of the Western world sees Palestinian settle
ments not as being occupied by the Jewish state,
but as part of the Jewish homeland.
"[There has been a] failure to put the conflict
in an international context," Shehadeh said.

Shehadeh said the effect of some interna
tional agreements, including the "largely inef
fectual" Oslo negotiations of 1993, only ended
up encouraging (he application of "two sepa

rate legal regimes and legal developments to
the Jewish and Palestinian people, [which re
sulted in] an apartheid-like situation."
One audience member asked: "What ap
proach would you lake towards accomplishing
what every Palestinian has in mind â€” the com
plete return of occupied territories?"
Shehadeh said that although a majority of
Palestinians seek complete independence, not
all do. According to Shehadeh, honest negotia
tion, reduced violence, better leadership and a
freer and more democratic system of govern
ment are important ingredients in achieving a
peaceful solution in the region.
Other audience members asked how the con
llict relates to America. One person asked She
hadeh whar Palestinians could do the change the
view many Americans have of them as terrorists,
which has been a problem since Sept. 11, 2001.
Shehadeh urged that non-violence is the answer,
although he admitted it is difficult to see a com
plete cease-fire happening because "the Israeli
siege is worse now than ever."
Nile Elwardani, an audience member from
outside of Stanford, said that she agreed with
Shehadeh's comments about the need for
Americans to be better informed.
"The people in this audience are well-in
formed," she said, "but they're not representa
tive of the American people."
