## The 						Stanford Daily ISU decision a model for athletic organizations 
### 
Published Since 1891

In last week's swift and sweeping vote
to amend figure skating's judging
system, the International Skating
Union showed a selfless resolve to
make changes that better the sport and the
Olympic Games. Instead of athleticism and
rivalries, the 2002 Winter Olympics have
up to this point been characterized by the
scandal that gave the Russians a gold
medal in pair's figure skating over the
seemingly deserving Canadians and ex
posed a judge's supposed corruption.
Even though the details of the scandal are
far from clear and, with the accused
French judge waffling on her claims of

pressure to "trade" medals with the Rus
sians, the ISU voted unanimously to rid
the sport of the inadequacies the scandal
brought to life.
The current system, in which skaters are
judged on a 6-point. scale and then ranked
by judges to determine who wins, will be
discarded completely. The new system will
alleviate scandal claims with its objectivity.
Instead of nine judges there will be 14,
seven of whom will have their scores ran
domly selected by a computer. While the
sport may still lack independent judges,
the ISU's decisive move demonstrates
model behavior for sports governing bod

ies, Olympic, professional and collegiate.
Major League Baseball, the NCAA and
the National Basketball Association can
each learn much from the ISU's action.
Unions, owners and bureaucracies should
have little to do with a sport besides making
it more competitive and enjoyable for the
fan. More specifically, sports should consid
er adopting more objective judging stan
dards like those that will be put into place.
If the rigid ISU deems these changes nec
essary, then the same types of changes
would likely improve many sports.
The NCAA, for example, might consider
a similar system for scoring its gymnastics

meets. It would be better to put such a sys
tem in place now rather than waiting fora
similar scandal.
The ISU changed a process steeped in
tradition without a second thought. There
was no waiting for assurances of wrongdo
ing or input from international bureaucra
cies. The ISU simply served up the decision
it deemed best for its athletes and fans. It
relied on common sense over history and
dramatics, and in doing so it did its best to
transform an Olympics rife with division
and controversy back into what the Games
are meant for: fostering unity among na
tions and the world.
