# CARDINAL PRIDE
## Go Robber Barons, fight! 
### 
If you're like me, then you've proba
bly caught a lot of flak from friends
at other colleges who love to deride
Stanford's nickname and mascot.
"The Cardinal," they ask sarcastically,
"gee, that's not a rip-ofl of the Harvard
Crimson, is it?" Alternatively, they might
opt for the "Wow, you can't get much
more intimidating than a tree, can you?"
remark. But the next time you hear peo
ple badmouthing the Cardinal and its as
sociated Tree, take heart — there are far
stupider college nicknames and mascots
out there.
For example, if we're going to talk
about colors consider Syracuse Universi
ty. Its nickname is the Orangemen,
which is not really any lamer than the
Cardinal. However, their mascot is —

and I swear I'm not mak
ing this up — an orange.
As in the piece of fruit.
He's actually an anthro
pomorphic orange, with
legs, arms and jaunty
baseball cap. His big
trick at Syracuse basket
ball games is to roll
around, much to the de

light of the Syracuse faithful, who really
must be starved for entertainment.
Another popular subset of the lame
nickname / mascot category is ridiculous
animals. One needs to look no further then
our neighbor on the shores, UC-Santa
Cruz. Its fierce athletic tradition is embod
ied by its nickname: The Banana Slugs. Up
in Washington, Evergreen State College
goes even further down the evolutionary
ladder. Its nickname is the Goeducks (pro
nounced "Gooey-ducks"), which are cer
tainly gooey but not at all ducks. A Goe
duck is actually a gigantic, freakish mol
lusk, kind of like a clam on steroids, which
can weigh up to 20 pounds.
Meanwhile, on the East Coast, the
University of Delaware has opted for the
Fighting Blue Mens as its nickname (pre
sumably the chemicals in the water there
cause some interesting poultry muta
tions). Not to be outdone, Williams Col
lege in Massachusetts sports a surrealist
looking purple cow as its mascot. Moo!
Come to think of it, Williams lias a lot
ofexplaining to do. Its official nickname
is the Ephmen, named after school
founder Ephraim Williams. Its bitter
rival, Amherst College, is likewise nick
named the Lord Jeffs after its founder,
Lord Jeffrey Amherst. I'm sure Ephraim
and Jeffrey were wonderful men, fellas,
but is your nickname the best place to
commemorate them? This sort of think
ing would have led to the Stanford "Le
lands" or the UC-Berkeley "California
State Legislatures."
The University of Mississippi has to
take the prize for most tasteless mascot.
You think that all the old "Indian" mas
cots were offensive? Well. Ole Miss (The
"Rebels") has an antebellum slave planta

tion owner as its mascot. He's portrayed
as an elderly gentleman with a cane and a
long, droopy mustache. As a show of sup
port, Ole Miss fans have a penchant for
waving Confederate flags at football
games. And they, say the South will never
rise again.
Meanwhile, our proud and noble ser
vice academies have a proud and noble
tradition of weird nicknames and mas
cots. Army is positively schizophrenic,
with two nicknames (Cadets and Black
Knights) and a wholly unrelated mascot
(a donkey).
Navy has chosen as its mascot the
quintessential marine animal, who repre
sents all of the ocean's grandeur: a goat.
The Coast Guard Academy, using equal
ly warped logic, calls its sports teams the
Bears.
Still, the above examples, for all their
shortcomings, are at least recognizable. I
mean, you can envision a Purple Cow or
a Blue Hen, and even a Lord Jeff is root
ed in tangible reality. Some other nick
names are not so fortunate.
lake the Billiken, for example. De
spite the fact that they've had the nick
name for almost a hundred years, virtual
ly no one knows what the damn thing is.
Apparently, around the turn of the centu
ry someone dreamed up a bizarre,
whitish gnome-like figure, called it a "Bil
liken" for reasons unknown, and started
selling it as little statuettes and coin banks.
The folks at Saint Louis University
thought this was a fantastic idea and
quickly adopted it, and ever since the uni
versity has been saddled with an incom
prehensible nickname and a mascot who
looks like Casper the Ghost's evil twin.
Georgetown University's nickname,
the Hoyas, is even worse. Proposing the
ories about what exactly a Hoya is has
practically become a cottage industry
over there. Georgetown's official line is
that it originated from the Latin-Greek
phrase "Hoia Saxa," meaning "What
Rocks," in reference to Georgetown's
original nickname of the Stonewalls.
Others contest that explanation, insist
ing that it the Hoya is a scrambled-up
version of the word "Ahoy" or a bas
tardization of an old French call used
when casting a vote.
So there you have it. Compared to
some colleges out there, Stanford's nick
name and mascot are models of thought
fulness and restraint. Be glad that, when
the University cast aside the Indian 25
years ago, your predecessors had the wis
dom and taste to choose the Cardinal and
the Tree.
Although you have to admit, "Stan
ford Robber Barons" would have been
pretty cool.
