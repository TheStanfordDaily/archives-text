Vagina Monologues should have
addressed abortion
I would like to extend my heartfelt
congratulations to the organizers and ac
tors of this year's Vagina Monologues.
Each performance was outstanding, a fit
ting tribute to the necessary respect for
the female body.
While many pertinent matters were
addressed in these monologues, I was sur
prised that abortion was not among them.
Naturally, this is in no way a criticism of
Stanford's excellent execution of the diffi
cult subject matter, but a deficiency in the
script itself: why was this incredibly im
portant issue, completely bound to the
vagina, left out of the monologues?
Abortion is essential to all those pro
moting such vagina-related discussions;
the primary purpose of the vagina is, after
all, reproduction. And although the Vagi
na Monologues concludes with a poignant
description of birth, the counterpart to re
productive health — the termination of
pregnancy — was never mentioned.
The abortion experience should be in
cluded in order to sufficiently address is
sues related to female sexuality. In Ameri
ca, 1.5 million abortions are performed
every year. Nearly 30 million have been
performed since the Roe v. Wade deci
sion. With such staggering numbers, why
is the issue omitted from the Monologues?
The question of whether the experience
is positive or negative is irrelevant; in all re
spects, abortion profoundly influences the
way in which our society views the vagina,
which, as I understand it, was the purpose
of last Wednesday's presentation.
There were many opportunities fora
monologue to discuss abortion. For exam
ple, in the "Angry Vagina" segment, the
woman could have expressed resentment
for being injected with a painful salt solu
tion in order to abort the pregnancy, or

having sharp instruments accidentally cut
her uterine wall, or undergoing the oper
ation without enough pain medication.
In the piece concerning rape, the char
acter could have stated how she felt after an
abortion ended a rape-induced pregnancy.
A woman could have talked about taking
RU-486, and the tolls it took on her body
(i.e., labor pains, bl(X)dy discharge, passing
the fetus without medical supervision).
There could have been a discourse
about ending a pregnancy because the
fetus was diagnosed with a genetic dis
ease. There was an excellent montage
about the innumerable aspects of men
struation — why not one about abortion?
Few would disagree that abortion pro
cedures could be seriously improved. The
Vagina Monologues successfully broached
many attitudes involving women's health;
abortion, too, calls for reassessment.
It is currently the only medical proce
dure that doctors are not legally required
to explain to a patient before operation. In
that aspect, abortion simply sustains the
19th-century notion that women are too
weak and too stupid to be educated about
their own health and biological functions.
The Vagina Monologues actually re
volves on this very dilemma: women sim
ply aren't familiar with their own bodies.
Open discussion alone will improve
this stark reality. Women should not be
satisfied with abortion's status quo. Why
should we pigeonhole the issue of abor
tion when, should trends continue, it will
affect 40 percent of women by the age of
45? Why should we suffocate our own
.sense of awareness? The abortion indus
try is a billion-dollar business — if Amer
ican women are investing this much an
nually on a vagina-related procedure, I
would certainly hope that they demand
better treatment.
As a voice for raising consciousness
and challenging minds, the Mono

logues should incorporate this aspect of
women's reproductive health and shat
ter the silence. Those involved in the
abortion debate, pro-life and pro
choice alike, should state their concerns
that abortion — the medical proce
dure, not the legal 1 iglit — must be ad
dressed in a public forum such as the
Vagina Monologues.

Stanford engaged in "union-busting"
Stanford does not voluntarily hire
union workers; it has enforced relation
ships with collective bargaining agents
for employee bargaining units. Indeed,
while I worked at Stanford Hospital as a
human resources manager — some
years ago now — the University ex
pended many resources fighting em
ployee organizing campaigns. It even
paid large sums of money for the ser
vices of "union-busting" consultants.
I am not sufficiently familiar with the
recent living / prevailing wage initiative
to comment on it, but I can say that one
of the motivations of the hospital's com
pensation program, over which I briefly
had significant, responsibility, was to con
vince employees that unionization was
unnecessary / undesirable. At that time
the principal determinant of wage rates
was comparability with similar salaries in
our employee markets. In what seemed
to me something like a "conspiracy in re
straint of trade," we shared compensa
tion information with comparable / "com
petitive" employers and set our salary
ranges accordingly. Special attention was
paid to unionized employee groups.
