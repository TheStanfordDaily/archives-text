# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## HAAS director remembers John Gardner 
### NADINNE CRUZ GUEST COLUMNIST 
Last Saturday night, John Gardner
died in his home at Stanford, surround
ed by his family. To the expected out
pouring of tributes on John's life, I want
to add a personal reflection on my en
counters with a man of uncommon vi
sion and devotion to public service.
Among his many achievements, John is
the inspiration for the yearlong, post
graduate John Gardner Public Service
Fellowships, which are annually awarded
to seniors at Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
and among whose alumni are some of the
most extraordinary young leaders I have
ever met.
The Haas Center for Public Service was
privileged to have John serve on its Na
tional Advisory Board, and to have him
play him a significant role in the Center's
formation and vision. As the first Miriam
and Peter Haas Centennial Professor,
John Gardner embodied the professor
ship's purpose to bring stature, promi
nence and visibility to the public service at
Stanford. His presence in the Haas ('en
ter's life will be sorely missed.
John Gardner will forever make me
think twice before declining a student
who asks to talk about life at the most in
convenient moments of my most highly
scripted days.
Several times over the past five years,

I fought to overcome my reluctance to
seek counsel from a man of such giant
stature. Each time, John generously
made room in his very full life to "listen
eloquently" and to bring to bear his life's
wisdom on the issues I posed to him.
We talked across differences of all
sorts — political, cultural, generational,
among the many — to probe the chal
lenges of weaving the uniqueness and
different communities and constituen
cies into a "commons."
As might be expected of a leader
steeped in the drama of America's yet
unfulfilled promise, John talked about
the broad sweep of social issues. Yet I was
surprised how often his more casual,
personal comments would capture my
attention and stay with me for days: that
he spoke Spanish at home (his wife, Aida,
is Guatemalan); that he thought every
leader's strength required a foundation
of personal support — he said that for
him, that was Aida, daughters Stephanie
and Francesca, grandchildren and great
grandchildren; that the manager-leader
needs a "kitchen cabinet" whose trust in
each other was absolute; and that a
moralistic, "high-minded" vision of a
better society can't be above engagement
in power struggles.
Each time I was given over to one of
my favorite Utopian fancies, John would
counter with the challenge: did I have
the guts to make it happen?

The last conversation I had with John
is one I will always treasure. In the wake
of the unrelenting sadness and grief of
Sept. 11,1 made my way to visit with him.
Ever gracious, John made light of his
weakening body and the growing gap
between his 89-year old frame and the
fire of his vision fora better world. I felt
self-conscious of the time I was taking
from him and the frailty of his health, but
I overcame my hesitance with the urgen
cy of my own needs.
I beheld an elder who engaged for
decades with the ebbs and flows of individ
ual and social life cycles, and I felt the need
to tap his wisdom. So 1 posed to John my
anxious queries about public service in the
context of Sept. 11. As we rush to respond
to our current crises, how do we speak to
the value of the seemingly more mun
dane, daily, and methodical work to ad
dress the chronic, and often invisible, dis
tresses of our human condition?
John Gardner's response was as simple
as it was resonant for me. There's the
work of fending off attacks, of damage
control. And then there's the daily job of
building immunity. That's about nurtur
ing a healthy body or a healthy society.
You don't build immunity only by fight
ing back. You don't maintain health by
doing one thing. It's part of a daily routine,
of eating well, exercising, doing the right
things in a sustained way. It's subtle kind
of work, but you'll feel it when it isn't there!

For the rest of that day, I played with
images that spoke to me of the value of
different kinds of work across the "spec
trum of public service."
Firefighters we know about. But other
folks quietly sew to mend rips and tears in
the cloth of our communities and of our
body politic. Or weave to create new
tapestries of emerging communities
where none existed before. Firefighters
and weavers. These two different images
captured my sense of the different ener
gies and urgencies each evokes, without
diminishing the importance of either.
The public service firefighters respond
to situations that are compelling, in large
part because they are often clear, urgent,
and immediate. Others do the quiet mend
ing and weaving of social bonds, and of cre
ating new "social capital" across diverse
groups, so that the healthy community can
withstand challenges to its wholeness.
Firefighters and weavers. I felt re
newed with a clarity about what public ser
vice ought to teach. If we do a good job as
public service educators, students will
learn the skills of both firefighting and
weaving. If we are successful in creating a
community of public service learners, then
no matter which path students choose to
follow, they will respect the fire fighter and
the weaver, and they will know that each is
an integral part of the other.
I was well aware that John Gardner had
so eloquently spoken and written about

public purpose — lar deeper and broader
than my one little moment of epiphany.
John taught me in that proverbial "teach
able moment," when 1 had a question, and
1 appeared open to suggestions.
At my now "elder age" of 53 years, 1
often feel I should know better, but John
gave me an unexpec ted gift of permission
to ask a question, when I was unabashedly,
and shamelessly caring to find an answer.
What I took away from that last visit
with John was that, in addition to every
thing else that has been said about his
achievements, John Gardner was a kind,
caring,' responsive, and thoughtful
teacher. He made time fora one-on-one
exchange that was unhurried as it was
selfless. To his last days, he practiced
what he preached, and, as a conse
quence, he touched my soul.
In his book "On Leadership" John
Gardner wrote: "Change is in the air.
Something is coming to an end; some
thing is beginning. It is a shaping time in
our nation and in the world. We have the
opportunity fora new cast at history."
I feel moved by John Gardner's call to
that grand drama of shaping our human
ity. But I will not forget his quiet
grandeur, through the simple gift of
earnest conversation and a willingness to
teach one person at a time.

and weavers. These two different images
captured my sense of the different ener
gies and urgencies each evokes, without
diminishing the importance of either.
The public service firefighters respond
to situations that are compelling, in large
part because they are often clear, urgent,
and immediate. Others do the quiet mend
ing and weaving of social bonds, and of cre
ating new "social capital" across diverse
groups, so that the healthy community can
withstand challenges to its wholeness.
Firefighters and weavers. I felt re
newed with a clarity about what public ser
vice ought to teach. If we do a good job as
public service educators, students will
learn the skills of both firefighting and
weaving. If we are successful in creating a
community of public service learners, then
no matter which path students choose to
follow, they will respect the fire fighter and
the weaver, and they will know that each is
an integral part of the other.
I was well aware that John Gardner had
so eloquently spoken and written about

public purpose — lar deeper and broader
than my one little moment of epiphany.
John taught me in that proverbial "teach
able moment," when 1 had a question, and
1 appeared open to suggestions.
At my now "elder age" of 53 years, 1
often feel I should know better, but John
gave me an unexpec ted gift of permission
to ask a question, when I was unabashedly,
and shamelessly caring to find an answer.
What I took away from that last visit
with John was that, in addition to every
thing else that has been said about his
achievements, John Gardner was a kind,
caring,' responsive, and thoughtful
teacher. He made time fora one-on-one
exchange that was unhurried as it was
selfless. To his last days, he practiced
what he preached, and, as a conse
quence, he touched my soul.
In his book "On Leadership" John
Gardner wrote: "Change is in the air.
Something is coming to an end; some
thing is beginning. It is a shaping time in
our nation and in the world. We have the
opportunity fora new cast at history."
I feel moved by John Gardner's call to
that grand drama of shaping our human
ity. But I will not forget his quiet
grandeur, through the simple gift of
earnest conversation and a willingness to
teach one person at a time.

Last Saturday night, John Gardner
died in his home at Stanford, surround
ed by his family. To the expected out
pouring of tributes on John's life, I want
to add a personal reflection on my en
counters with a man of uncommon vi
sion and devotion to public service.
Among his many achievements, John is
the inspiration for the yearlong, post
graduate John Gardner Public Service
Fellowships, which are annually awarded
to seniors at Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
and among whose alumni are some of the
most extraordinary young leaders I have
ever met.
The Haas Center for Public Service was
privileged to have John serve on its Na
tional Advisory Board, and to have him
play him a significant role in the Center's
formation and vision. As the first Miriam
and Peter Haas Centennial Professor,
John Gardner embodied the professor
ship's purpose to bring stature, promi
nence and visibility to the public service at
Stanford. His presence in the Haas ('en
ter's life will be sorely missed.
John Gardner will forever make me
think twice before declining a student
who asks to talk about life at the most in
convenient moments of my most highly
scripted days.
Several times over the past five years,

I fought to overcome my reluctance to
seek counsel from a man of such giant
stature. Each time, John generously
made room in his very full life to "listen
eloquently" and to bring to bear his life's
wisdom on the issues I posed to him.
We talked across differences of all
sorts — political, cultural, generational,
among the many — to probe the chal
lenges of weaving the uniqueness and
different communities and constituen
cies into a "commons."
As might be expected of a leader
steeped in the drama of America's yet
unfulfilled promise, John talked about
the broad sweep of social issues. Yet I was
surprised how often his more casual,
personal comments would capture my
attention and stay with me for days: that
he spoke Spanish at home (his wife, Aida,
is Guatemalan); that he thought every
leader's strength required a foundation
of personal support — he said that for
him, that was Aida, daughters Stephanie
and Francesca, grandchildren and great
grandchildren; that the manager-leader
needs a "kitchen cabinet" whose trust in
each other was absolute; and that a
moralistic, "high-minded" vision of a
better society can't be above engagement
in power struggles.
Each time I was given over to one of
my favorite Utopian fancies, John would
counter with the challenge: did I have
the guts to make it happen?

The last conversation I had with John
is one I will always treasure. In the wake
of the unrelenting sadness and grief of
Sept. 11,1 made my way to visit with him.
Ever gracious, John made light of his
weakening body and the growing gap
between his 89-year old frame and the
fire of his vision fora better world. I felt
self-conscious of the time I was taking
from him and the frailty of his health, but
I overcame my hesitance with the urgen
cy of my own needs.
I beheld an elder who engaged for
decades with the ebbs and flows of individ
ual and social life cycles, and I felt the need
to tap his wisdom. So 1 posed to John my
anxious queries about public service in the
context of Sept. 11. As we rush to respond
to our current crises, how do we speak to
the value of the seemingly more mun
dane, daily, and methodical work to ad
dress the chronic, and often invisible, dis
tresses of our human condition?
John Gardner's response was as simple
as it was resonant for me. There's the
work of fending off attacks, of damage
control. And then there's the daily job of
building immunity. That's about nurtur
ing a healthy body or a healthy society.
You don't build immunity only by fight
ing back. You don't maintain health by
doing one thing. It's part of a daily routine,
of eating well, exercising, doing the right
things in a sustained way. It's subtle kind
of work, but you'll feel it when it isn't there!

For the rest of that day, I played with
images that spoke to me of the value of
different kinds of work across the "spec
trum of public service."
Firefighters we know about. But other
folks quietly sew to mend rips and tears in
the cloth of our communities and of our
body politic. Or weave to create new
tapestries of emerging communities
where none existed before. Firefighters
and weavers. These two different images
captured my sense of the different ener
gies and urgencies each evokes, without
diminishing the importance of either.
