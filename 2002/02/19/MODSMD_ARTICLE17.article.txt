## Card whips Cougs 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
Saturday was about more than
just basketball for both the No. 2
women's basketball team and it
was about more than a packed
house at Maples Pavilion.
Before the Cardinal took to the
floor to bury Washington State,
76-50, in its last regular-season
home game, the team honored its
senior class.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford 76,
Washington State 50

A sign in the stands said it all:
"Thank you Bethany, Cori, Enjoli,
Lauren, and Lindsey."
The last few seasons have been
rough for these players, and Sat
urday not only marked a start to
their final days at the Farm, but
also served as a sweet reminder of
how far they had come.
" Today was significant in a dif
ferent way," senior guard Lindsey
Yamasaki said. "This symbolized
the beginning of the end. We'll have
nothing but farewells from now on."
Yamasaki, the team's leading
scorer this season, had a game
high 18 points in only 23 minutes
of play in her final regular-season
game at Maples.
Head coach Tara Van-
Derveer nixed her usual line-up
in order to start her senior core
in a contest that was nearly a
foregone conclusion.
The Cougars entered the game
at 2-23 overall and 0-15 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference. Stanford,
which had already won the regu
lar-season Pac-10 title outright last
Thursday, entered the game with
a perfect 15-0 record in confer
ence play and a 32-0 series record
against Washington State.

The Cougars, trying to avoid
going down in Pac-10 history as
the only squad to go winless in con
ference play, came out strong and
knocked in the first points of the
game on a 3-pointer by senior
guard Whitney Martindale.
The seniors responded, getting it
done on both ends of the court.
Stanford dominated the smaller
Washington State lineup in the
paint, as senior center Bethany
Donaphin went inside fora layup oil
an assist from senior guard Enjoli
Izidor to put Stanford on the board.
Izidor, running the point posi
tion, dished out another assist to
Yamasaki fora short jumper a few
plays later before senior guard
Lauren St. Clair found senior cen
ter Cori Enghusen posting strong
under the basket.
Sophomore forward Nicole
Powell, who took the court about
three minutes into the game,
missed a start for only the second
time in two seasons.
There was a moment of panic
when, late in the first half, Powell
went down clutching her face after
being poked in the eye. The for
ward left the game and the fans
held their breath until she re
turned in the second half.
Powell played four minutes in
the second half before enjoying a
break on the bench. She finished
with 10 points.
"This was Senior Day and we al
ready clinched the title, so I think
we were a little out of rhythm,"
VanDerveer said. "I really wanted a
lot of people to get playing time,
which happened, and I didn't want
anyone to get hurt. It scared me
when Nicole went down, but it gave
others the opportunity to step up."
Van Derveer cleared the bench
early, giving players like Yamasaki

and Powell a breather and letting
others shine.
Among those who sparkled was
freshman fonvard Azella Perryman.
Penyman scored 13 points and
collected a game-high 16 rebounds
for her second career double-double.
"I'm really excited about how
Azella played," said VanDerveer.
"It helps our team morale. When
people practice as hard as they do
in practice every day, you want to
reward them."
The Cardinal will finish its reg
ular season this weekend in Los
Angeles before heading to Oregon
next weekend for the inaugural
conference tournament.
Though the season is winding
down, Stanford is just getting
started on its race fora national
championship.
"The regular season was fora
seed in the [Pac-10] tournament,"
VanDerveer said. "Now we'll play
the [Pac-10] tournament fora seed
in the NCAA Tournament."
A No. 1 seed in die NCAA's would

mean that the (Cardinal would host
the first round — giving the seniors a
tew more games at Maples.
The seniors "have been part of
something special," said Yamasaki.
"We're a part of bringing Stanford
back to its tradition and that's ex
citing for us."

also served as a sweet reminder of
how far they had come.
" Today was significant in a dif
ferent way," senior guard Lindsey
Yamasaki said. "This symbolized
the beginning of the end. We'll have
nothing but farewells from now on."
Yamasaki, the team's leading
scorer this season, had a game
high 18 points in only 23 minutes
of play in her final regular-season
game at Maples.
Head coach Tara Van-
Derveer nixed her usual line-up
in order to start her senior core
in a contest that was nearly a
foregone conclusion.
The Cougars entered the game
at 2-23 overall and 0-15 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference. Stanford,
which had already won the regu
lar-season Pac-10 title outright last
Thursday, entered the game with
a perfect 15-0 record in confer
ence play and a 32-0 series record
against Washington State.

The Cougars, trying to avoid
going down in Pac-10 history as
the only squad to go winless in con
ference play, came out strong and
knocked in the first points of the
game on a 3-pointer by senior
guard Whitney Martindale.
The seniors responded, getting it
done on both ends of the court.
Stanford dominated the smaller
Washington State lineup in the
paint, as senior center Bethany
Donaphin went inside fora layup oil
an assist from senior guard Enjoli
Izidor to put Stanford on the board.
Izidor, running the point posi
tion, dished out another assist to
Yamasaki fora short jumper a few
plays later before senior guard
Lauren St. Clair found senior cen
ter Cori Enghusen posting strong
under the basket.
Sophomore forward Nicole
Powell, who took the court about
three minutes into the game,
missed a start for only the second
time in two seasons.
There was a moment of panic
when, late in the first half, Powell
went down clutching her face after
being poked in the eye. The for
ward left the game and the fans
held their breath until she re
turned in the second half.
Powell played four minutes in
the second half before enjoying a
break on the bench. She finished
with 10 points.
"This was Senior Day and we al
ready clinched the title, so I think
we were a little out of rhythm,"
VanDerveer said. "I really wanted a
lot of people to get playing time,
which happened, and I didn't want
anyone to get hurt. It scared me
when Nicole went down, but it gave
others the opportunity to step up."
Van Derveer cleared the bench
early, giving players like Yamasaki

for her second career double-double.
"I'm really excited about how
