# Men earn share of Pac-10 lead

### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
PULLMAN, Wash.—How
much would a Stanford player
sacrifice fora share of first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference?
The Cardinal's 76-63 victory
over Washington State on Satur
day provided a couple answers:
Tony Giovacchini decided to
donate an ankle. Casey Jacobsen
offered his left eye. Chris Her
nandez opted to give a shoulder.
And Justin Davis contributed a
rotator cuff.
All for the sake of a confer
ence win. And all for the sake of
the team.
Sacrifices like these surely
won't be uncommon in the weeks
to come, as the uphill battle is
about to get even tougher.
Yet despite the minor in
juries, smiles still prevailed
amongst the coaches and players
after the No. 10 Cardinal
clinched its first conference
road-trip sweep of the season in
front of 3,025 at Friel Court.
With a visit from the Los An
geles schools and a trip to Ari
zona on the horizon, Stanford
(17-6, 10-4 Pac-10) now finds it
self atop the Pac-10 standings in a
three-way tie with Southern Cali
fornia and Oregon.

76, Washington State 63

"We got what we came fora —a
win and a sweep and to go home
in first place. That's what we want
ed," Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery said.
According to team trainer
JoHan Wang, Hernandez, who
separated his shoulder, and
Davis, who suffered a sprained ro
tator cuff, will probably be ready
when the Cardinal hosts the Tro
jans on Thursday night.
Giovacchini's ankle sprain and
Jacobsen's eye bruise won't affect
their status for future games.
The injuries were certainly
symbolic of a tougher fight than
anyone might have expected
against the Cougars (5-18, 1-14),
who were forced to play without
their top two players, forward
Mike Bush and center J Locklier.
Washington State managed to
jump out to a 10-point lead in
the first half and it only trailed by
three points at halftime.
"Obviously they haven't quit
yet, and that's a credit to [coach]
Paul Graham," Montgomery said.

Junior center Curtis Borchardt picked up his sixth straight double-double
in Stanford's 76-63 victory over Washington State on Saturday. The Car
dinal finds itself in a three-way tie for first place in the Pac-10.
"We weren't at peak mental ca
pacity tonight. You can't change a
kid's mentality coming into the
game. I told them that the only way
we'd get into trouble is if [the
Cougars] made shots. They sure
made their shots."
Washington State's sophomore
point guard, Marcus Moore, was a
one-man wrecking new, as he had
eight rebounds and a game-high 29
points. He single-handedly kept the
Cougars close by hitting five 3-pointers.
The Cardinal, however, coun
tered the one-man Cougar effort
with a more even-keeled offensive
attack, one in which four different
players finished with double-digit
scoring. Jacobsen tallied a team
high 24 points and Borchardt
picked up his sixth straight double
double with 19 points, 11 rebounds
and five blocks.
Borchardt is the first Stanford
player ever to tally six double-dou
bles in a row. His season total of 66
blocks is 16 more than the prior sin
gle-season record, set by center
Tim Young in 1997.
Junior guard Julius Barnes was

4-of-7 from 3-point land and fin
ished with 1(5 points, while sopho
more power forward Teyo John
son made 5 of 6 attempts from the
field, scoring 11 points.
As Jacobsen put it, now is when
the "big-time ride" begins. The Pac
-10 Tournament will follow the two
game set at .Arizona, and the NCAA
Tournament the week after Pac
10s will not allow the players any
time for reprieve.
"You guys might think that we'll
be a little tired, but we're youngand
we're resilient and we practice
specifically for this moment of the
season." Jacobsen said.
The victory on Saturday marked
the first time this season the Cardi
nal has notched four wins in a row.
Just two weeks ago, Stanford was
2 1/2 games back of the conference
lead and a potential bubble team
for the Tournament. Now,
it's on top of the Pac-10 and, bar
ring an 0-4 finish and a poor show
ing at Staples Center, the Cardinal
has almost assured itself a spot in
the Big Dance.
"It's a tribute to this team that it
has battled back," Borchardt said.
"But we've got big games ahead of
us and they're huge. We're going
to have to scratch and battle the
entire way."

"We got what we came fora —a
win and a sweep and to go home
in first place. That's what we want
ed," Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery said.
According to team trainer
JoHan Wang, Hernandez, who
separated his shoulder, and
Davis, who suffered a sprained ro
tator cuff, will probably be ready
when the Cardinal hosts the Tro
jans on Thursday night.
Giovacchini's ankle sprain and
Jacobsen's eye bruise won't affect
their status for future games.
The injuries were certainly
symbolic of a tougher fight than
anyone might have expected
against the Cougars (5-18, 1-14),
who were forced to play without
their top two players, forward
Mike Bush and center J Locklier.
Washington State managed to
jump out to a 10-point lead in
the first half and it only trailed by
three points at halftime.
"Obviously they haven't quit
yet, and that's a credit to [coach]
Paul Graham," Montgomery said.

Junior center Curtis Borchardt picked up his sixth straight double-double
in Stanford's 76-63 victory over Washington State on Saturday. The Car
dinal finds itself in a three-way tie for first place in the Pac-10.
"We weren't at peak mental ca
pacity tonight. You can't change a
kid's mentality coming into the
game. I told them that the only way
we'd get into trouble is if [the
Cougars] made shots. They sure
made their shots."
Washington State's sophomore
point guard, Marcus Moore, was a
one-man wrecking new, as he had
eight rebounds and a game-high 29
points. He single-handedly kept the
Cougars close by hitting five 3-pointers.
The Cardinal, however, coun
tered the one-man Cougar effort
with a more even-keeled offensive
attack, one in which four different
players finished with double-digit
scoring. Jacobsen tallied a team
high 24 points and Borchardt
picked up his sixth straight double
double with 19 points, 11 rebounds
and five blocks.
Borchardt is the first Stanford
player ever to tally six double-dou
bles in a row. His season total of 66
blocks is 16 more than the prior sin
gle-season record, set by center
Tim Young in 1997.
Junior guard Julius Barnes was

4-of-7 from 3-point land and fin
ished with 1(5 points, while sopho
more power forward Teyo John
son made 5 of 6 attempts from the
field, scoring 11 points.
As Jacobsen put it, now is when
the "big-time ride" begins. The Pac
-10 Tournament will follow the two
game set at .Arizona, and the NCAA
Tournament the week after Pac
10s will not allow the players any
time for reprieve.
"You guys might think that we'll
be a little tired, but we're youngand
we're resilient and we practice
specifically for this moment of the
season." Jacobsen said.
The victory on Saturday marked
the first time this season the Cardi
nal has notched four wins in a row.
Just two weeks ago, Stanford was
2 1/2 games back of the conference
lead and a potential bubble team
for the Tournament. Now,
it's on top of the Pac-10 and, bar
ring an 0-4 finish and a poor show
ing at Staples Center, the Cardinal
has almost assured itself a spot in
the Big Dance.
"It's a tribute to this team that it
has battled back," Borchardt said.
"But we've got big games ahead of
us and they're huge. We're going
to have to scratch and battle the
entire way."
PULLMAN, Wash.—How
much would a Stanford player
sacrifice fora share of first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference?
The Cardinal's 76-63 victory
over Washington State on Satur
day provided a couple answers:
Tony Giovacchini decided to
donate an ankle. Casey Jacobsen
offered his left eye. Chris Her
nandez opted to give a shoulder.
And Justin Davis contributed a
rotator cuff.
All for the sake of a confer
ence win. And all for the sake of
the team.
Sacrifices like these surely
won't be uncommon in the weeks
to come, as the uphill battle is
about to get even tougher.
Yet despite the minor in
juries, smiles still prevailed
amongst the coaches and players
after the No. 10 Cardinal
clinched its first conference
road-trip sweep of the season in
front of 3,025 at Friel Court.
