# Men earn share of Pac-10 lead

### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
PULLMAN, Wash.—How
much would a Stanford player
sacrifice fora share of first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference?
The Cardinal's 76-63 victory
over Washington State on Satur
day provided a couple answers:
Tony Giovacchini decided to
donate an ankle. Casey Jacobsen
offered his left eye. Chris Her
nandez opted to give a shoulder.
And Justin Davis contributed a
rotator cuff.
All for the sake of a confer
ence win. And all for the sake of
the team.
Sacrifices like these surely
won't be uncommon in the weeks
to come, as the uphill battle is
about to get even tougher.
Yet despite the minor in
juries, smiles still prevailed
amongst the coaches and players
after the No. 10 Cardinal
clinched its first conference
road-trip sweep of the season in
front of 3,025 at Friel Court.
With a visit from the Los An
geles schools and a trip to Ari
zona on the horizon, Stanford
(17-6, 10-4 Pac-10) now finds it
self atop the Pac-10 standings in a
three-way tie with Southern Cali
fornia and Oregon.

Saturday: No. 10 Stanford
76, Washington State 63

"We got what we came fora —a
win and a sweep and to go home
in first place. That's what we want
ed," Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery said.
According to team trainer
JoHan Wang, Hernandez, who
separated his shoulder, and
Davis, who suffered a sprained ro
tator cuff, will probably be ready
when the Cardinal hosts the Tro
jans on Thursday night.
Giovacchini's ankle sprain and
Jacobsen's eye bruise won't affect
their status for future games.
The injuries were certainly
symbolic of a tougher fight than
anyone might have expected
against the Cougars (5-18, 1-14),
who were forced to play without
their top two players, forward
Mike Bush and center J Locklier.
Washington State managed to
jump out to a 10-point lead in
the first half and it only trailed by
three points at halftime.
"Obviously they haven't quit
yet, and that's a credit to [coach]
Paul Graham," Montgomery said.
