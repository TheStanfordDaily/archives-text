For the top-ranked Cardinal,
"business as usual" is not quite per
fect just yet. Though it continued its
early-season offensive success
against Fresno State (4-6), Stanford
(7-3) could not manage to pull ofl its
first series sweep and settled for two
of three games for the third consec
utive weekend.

Stanford rode another strong
pitching performance from junior
Jeremy Guthrie on Friday night to
open the series with a 6-2 win over
the Bulldogs.
Guthrie maintained his early
season M.0., scattering nine hits
while allowing just two runs and
walking one. The 22-year old right
hander has allowed 25 hits in 19 in
nings this season, hut his poise and
command on the hill have left him
with an outstanding 2.84 ERA and
a 3-0 record.
Fresno State senior Bob Run
yan dropped to 1-2 on the year
with the loss.
At the plate, sophomore right
fielder Carlos Quentin paced Stan
ford by tying a career high with
four hits in the ballgame. The
power-hitting Quentin emerged
from the entire weekend in Fresno
leading the team with a .485 aver
age and three home runs. year

in his collegiate debut, Quentin
blasted a home run in his first at-bat
of the game against the Bulldogs.
"I have some good memories
here in Fresno," Quentin said.
"I'm really not trying to do too
much at the plate. I'm just going to
settle for hitting the ball some
where, relaxing and keeping my
stroke nice and compact."
The sophomore added to his
Beiden Field success with a solo
home run in the series finale.
In Saturday's 7-5 Cardinal loss,
freshman starter Mark Jecman's
struggles persisted as Fresno State
chased him from the mound after
two-plus innings. He gave up four
runs and five hits before sopho
more pitcher Drew Erlich entered
in the third, surrendering three
runs on eight hits in the Cardinal's
longest relief appearance of the
year — six innings.
The Bulldogs broke through in
the third, taking advantage of a Jec
man error and four consecutive hits
to post four runs in the inning and
increase their lead to 5-0. They
added runs in the fourth and fifth
before Erlich settled down and
cuffed them the rest of the way.
I he Cardinal had two opportu
nities to salvage the contest with
rallies in the fifth and eighth in
nings. Stanford cut the Fresno
State lead to 6-3 after freshman
Chris Carter and senior shortstop
Scott Dragicevich led off with back
to-back doubles.
Sophomore center fielder Sam
Fuld drove home Dragicevich, but
junior catcher Ryan Garko ground
ed into his second double play of
the ballgame to end the Cardinal
threat.
In the eighth, Stanford loaded

the bases with no outs and looked to
come back from a late 7-3 deficit.
However, the Cardinal managed
only a Quentin sacrifice fly and an
RBI-fielder's choice from freshman
first baseman Donny Lucy before
sophomore leftfielder Brian Hall's
groundout brought the Stanford
comeback to a halt.
The loss dropped Jecman to 0-
3 with a 12.38 ERA, while Bull

dog starter Ben Fritz improved to
2-1. Fritz even belted a home run
in a solid all-around performance
at home.
While Sunday rains cancelled
the scheduled series finale, the
President's Day holiday allowed the
teams to conclude the weekend af
fair with a noontime start yesterday.

Stanford rode another strong
pitching performance from junior
Jeremy Guthrie on Friday night to
open the series with a 6-2 win over
the Bulldogs.
Guthrie maintained his early
season M.0., scattering nine hits
while allowing just two runs and
walking one. The 22-year old right
hander has allowed 25 hits in 19 in
nings this season, hut his poise and
command on the hill have left him
with an outstanding 2.84 ERA and
a 3-0 record.
Fresno State senior Bob Run
yan dropped to 1-2 on the year
with the loss.
At the plate, sophomore right
fielder Carlos Quentin paced Stan
ford by tying a career high with
four hits in the ballgame. The
power-hitting Quentin emerged
from the entire weekend in Fresno
leading the team with a .485 aver
age and three home runs. year

in his collegiate debut, Quentin
blasted a home run in his first at-bat
of the game against the Bulldogs.
"I have some good memories
here in Fresno," Quentin said.
"I'm really not trying to do too
much at the plate. I'm just going to
settle for hitting the ball some
where, relaxing and keeping my
stroke nice and compact."
The sophomore added to his
Beiden Field success with a solo
home run in the series finale.
In Saturday's 7-5 Cardinal loss,
freshman starter Mark Jecman's
struggles persisted as Fresno State
chased him from the mound after
two-plus innings. He gave up four
runs and five hits before sopho
more pitcher Drew Erlich entered
in the third, surrendering three
runs on eight hits in the Cardinal's
longest relief appearance of the
year — six innings.
The Bulldogs broke through in
the third, taking advantage of a Jec
man error and four consecutive hits
to post four runs in the inning and
increase their lead to 5-0. They
added runs in the fourth and fifth
before Erlich settled down and
cuffed them the rest of the way.
I he Cardinal had two opportu
nities to salvage the contest with
rallies in the fifth and eighth in
nings. Stanford cut the Fresno
State lead to 6-3 after freshman
Chris Carter and senior shortstop
Scott Dragicevich led off with back
to-back doubles.
Sophomore center fielder Sam
Fuld drove home Dragicevich, but
junior catcher Ryan Garko ground
ed into his second double play of
the ballgame to end the Cardinal
threat.
In the eighth, Stanford loaded

the bases with no outs and looked to
come back from a late 7-3 deficit.
However, the Cardinal managed
only a Quentin sacrifice fly and an
RBI-fielder's choice from freshman
first baseman Donny Lucy before
sophomore leftfielder Brian Hall's
groundout brought the Stanford
comeback to a halt.
The loss dropped Jecman to 0-
3 with a 12.38 ERA, while Bull

dog starter Ben Fritz improved to
2-1. Fritz even belted a home run
in a solid all-around performance
at home.
