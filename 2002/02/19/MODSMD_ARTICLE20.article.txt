Ah, sweet, sweet revenge.
Flash back to April 21 last year when UCLA
brought the Stanford men's volleyball team's
season to an early end by handing the Cardinal
a heart-breaking five-game loss in the first
round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament.
Now roll ahead to this past Saturday when, for
ihe first time this year, Stanford went toe-to-toe
with the Bruins, who came into Burnham Pavilion
with the nation's top ranking and an unblemished
con ference record.
And skip ahead to Sunday, when UCLA headed

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Saturday: No. 8 Stanford 3, No. 1 UCLA 1

home with its first conference loss of the season, and
the Cardinal players woke up with big grins on their
faces after coming up with their biggest win of the
year when they needed it the most.
With nearly 1,000 boisterous fans cramped into
Burnham on Saturday, No. 8 Stanford (8-0, 7-4
MPSF) picked up a convincing !J-1 win over the
Bruinsand brought UCLA's 10-match win streak to
an unexpected end.
" Fhe crowd was a huge factor in our win over
UCLA," said junior outside hit
ter Billy Strickland, who had
four solo blocks in the match.
'They were very loud and sup
portive and breathed new life into
our team. I do not think UCLA
was ready for our fans."
Junior outside hitter Curt
Toppel led the way for the Car
dinal with a match-high 18 kills
on top of three service aces.
Strickland, senior outside hitter
Marcus Skacel and freshman
middle blocker Craig Buell also
posted double-digit kill totals, as
the Cardinal narrowly outkilled
the Bruins, 69-67.
Both teams showed their of
fensive firepower in the first
game, with each squad hitting
over .500. Neither squad led by
more than three before senior
outside hitter Matt Komer
clinched a 31-29 win for the Bru
ins with one of his three service
aces on the night..
The Cardinal bounced back
to make the second game the

most lopsided of the contest.
UCLA struggled to slow the
Stanford attack, getting outhit
.371 to .238 in the game, and the
Cardinal never trailed, taking
the game, 30-24.
The third game was a sloppy
affair with the teams combing for
21 hitting errors on just 26 kills.
After blowing an early five-point
lead, Stanford overcame a late
three-point deficit to win the
game, 31-29.
The Cardinal then cruised to a
30-25 win in the fourth to clinch
the match.
Junior libero Seth Ring came
up with 13 digs to lead Stan
ford's backcourt, which has
looked much improved in the
Cardinal's current three-match
win streak. The three wins have
put the Cardinal into fifth place
in the MPSF, as Stanford contin
ues to recover from a five-match
losing streak that had sent the
Cardinal tumbling in the confer
ence and the rankings.

out its next-to-last homestand
of the season.
