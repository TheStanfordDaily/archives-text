It was an overcast day at the Avery Aquatic Center

records were set and the top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming and diving team finished its dnal
meet season unbeaten.
The Cardinal (8-0, 5-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
swam past archrival No. 4 California (7-2,5-1 Pac-10)
with a 159.5-140.5 victory, extending its consecutive
dual-meet win streak to 12, dating back to last season.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford defeats No. 4
California, 159.5-140.5.

Stanford won 11 of 16 events. Senior co-captain
Shelly Ripple spearheaded the squad with three indi
vidual victories in the 200-yard backstroke (1:56.81),
the 200 butterfly (1:57.52) and the 200 individual
medley (1:59.85). Her times met the NCAA "A" qual
ifying standard in all three events.
Sophomore Tara Kirk outraced Cal's Staciana
Stitts to capture the titles in the 100 and 200 breast
stroke, both with NCAA "A" marks. She eclipsed her
own pool record in the 100 breaststroke by clocking in
at 1:00.23, remaining undefeated in the event in 15
career collegiate races.
Senior co-captain Jessica Foschi
continued her dominance in the
500 freestyle with her 18th straight
victory in the event in a time of
4:47.29. She also won the 1000
free (9:59.38).
"I was really pleased with our
competitive effort," said head
swimming coach Richard Quick.
"Ripple, Foschi and Kirk are so
consistently tough that sometimes
we have a tendency to take them
for granted. It looks like [fresh
man] Lacey Boutwell is moving
into that category as a real out
standing swimmer for us."

Boutwell, a sprint free special
ist, took the title in the 50 free. Her
time of 22.89 was 0.02 seconds
short of breaking the pool record
set by former Stanford swimmer
and Olympic legend Jenny
Thompson in 1992.
Boutwell also posted NCAA "A"
marks in strong second-place fin
ishes behind Golden Bear sopho
more Natalie Coughlin in both the
100 free and the 100 fly.
Coughlin, who was named
NCAA and Pac-10 Swimmer of the
Year in 2001, broke the pool
records in both the 100 free
(48.89) and 100 fly (52.35). She
rounded out her trio of individual
victories by edging Foschi to cap
ture the 200 free.
The meet's fourth pool record
was set by Stanford's 200 medley

relay team, consisting of Ripple,
Kirk, Boutwell and junior Sara
Watchorn, which clocked in at a
time of 1:40.87.
"We also had a young fresh
man, Kirsten Gilbert, step up
and get two third places in the
breaststroke that were huge,"
Quick said.
The Cardinal's impressive
swimming performance was com
plemented by a strong showing by
the diving squad, which
outscored Cal, 31-9. Junior
McKenze Murphy won both the
one- and the three-meter spring
board competitions with career
best scores of 288.75 and 307.20
points, respectively.
"Diving was outstanding for us
and really separated us from Cal,"
Quick said.
