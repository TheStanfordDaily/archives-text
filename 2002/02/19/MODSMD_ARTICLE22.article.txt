The Cardinal took the field for
its first game against its highest
ranked opponent so far this sea
son, No. 10 Cal State-Fullerton (6-
5). The face-off would prove to be
a pitcher's duel in which junior
Tori Nyberg finished the victor.
The Titans came out strong
and took the lead in the bottom of
the first when Monica Lucatero
scored on a Yasmin Mossadeghi
pop fly that dropped into shallow
left field.
Fullerton held onto its lead
until the top of the sixth inning
when the Cardinal struck back.
Senior shortstop Robin Walker
and outfielder Jessica Mendoza
kicked off' the rally by hitting sin
gles, which put runners on second
and third with senior first baseman
Sarah Beeson stepping into the
box. Beeson shot a two-run double
to left field, putting the Cardinal
ahead, 2-1.
The one-run lead proved to be
enough as both pitchers silenced
the opposing offense for the re
mainder of the game. Nyberg al
lowed just two hits in the win and
struck out a personal-record 11 bat
ters in the victory over the Titans.
Stanford took a short break
before facing its second oppo

nent of the day, Cal State-
Northridge (7-7).
The Cardinal attacked early in
its contest against the Matadors, as
freshman outfielder Leah Nelson
drove in freshman pinch-runner
outfielder Heather Shook in the
bottom of the second. Fellow fresh
man infielder Meghan Sickler's
hot bat continued the rally in the
second when she shot a double to
left, driving in two runs and
putting the score at 3-0. The Car
dinal posted one more run in the
bottom of the fifth on an RBI sin
gle by Beeson.
Junior pitcher Maureen
LeCocq pitched a complete game
and held the Matadors scoreless
until the top of the seventh, when
they were able to squeak two runs
past the Cardinal. LeCocq then
shut down the Matadors, finishing
the game at 4-2 with her second
victory of the year.
Saturday, the Cardinal took
the field again for games against
Utah State (1-8) and San Diego
State (6-7-1).
Stanford did not wait long to
pounce on the Aggies, as it scored
four runs in the top of the first.
Beeson knocked in Walker with
an RBI single to post the first run
of the game. Later, with the bases
loaded, Allister singled up the
middle, plating Beeson and junior
infielder Kira Ching.
Stanford wrapped up the first
inning onslaught when junior
outfielder Cassi Brangham
drove in LeCocq for the fourth
run of the game.
The Aggies battled back in the
bottom of the first, but were only
able to produce one run on a single
and an RBI double before LeCocq
put an end to the Lltah State effort.
Both sides went scoreless until
the fifth when the Cardinal ex
ploded again with a three-run
blast by Allister. The sophomore
catcher sent a home run over the
fence, scoring Beeson, Ching and
herself to give Stanford a 7-1 lead.
However, the Aggies answered
back yet again.

Utah State scored two runs in
the bottom of the fifth on three
base hits before LeCocq shut
them down.
Freshman Elizabeth Bendig
came in for LeCocq in the bottom
of the sixth and pitched the re
mainder of the game to secure the
7-3 victory.
The Cardinal then faced off in
its final match of the tournament
against host San Diego State.
Stanford continued its rampage
at the plate as it scored nine runs
in five innings.
Nyberg finished with a shutout,
allowing just two hits to gain her
fifth win of the season.
The Stanford lineup kicked off
its attack in the second when Allis
ter roped her second home run of
the day to give the Cardinal a 2-0
lead. Stanford tacked on another

run an inning later when Ching
drove in Mendoza.
Then, in the top of the fourth,
the Cardinal broke the game open
by scoring six runs to finish off the
9-0 victory.
Brangham drove in LeCocq for
the first run of the inning on a sac
rifice fly. Sickler kept the rally alive
with a single before Walker dou
bled down the left-field line to
score Nelson and post the fifth run
of the victory.
Mendoza then hit a two-run
single to drive in Sickler and
Walker fora 7-0 lead. Ching then
roped a base hit, scoring Mendoza
to increase the Stanford advan
tage to 8-0.
Allister, who finished 4 of 7 with
two runs scored and eight RBI on
the day, drove in Beeson for the
ninth Cardinal run.
