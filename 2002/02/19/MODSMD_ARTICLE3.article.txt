Culminating its show with an impas
sioned violin smashing, the southern
rock band Ten Mile Tide beat out four
other groups Saturday night to win Phi
Kappa Psi's 12th annual Battle of the
Bands competition.
Almost 1,000 spectators packed Toyon
Hall throughout the night to hear the
five finalists play 30-minute sets, with
Ten Mile Tide beating out the hip hop
group o.n.e. by a mere two points to cap
ture first place.
"It was probably one of our most success
ful battles ever," said senior Zach Pincus, Phi
Psi's public relations chair.
Ten Mile fide won first place with 274
points, o.n.e. placed second with 272,
Leonard placed third with 270 and 60/40
Breakdown and Blind Man's Dream placed
fourth and fifth, respectively.
Many band members said that they
didn't participate to win. They were more
interested in playing their music and enter
taining the crowd.
"We really didn't go in there with the ex
pectation to win anything," said senior Jill

Wheaton, the lead singer of Leonard. "We
were happy to come in third, but that was
just the bonus after getting to be there."
Phi Psi auditioned approximately 15
bands, five of which were chosen for the
finals.
Blind Man's Dream, a rock group mak
ing its Battle of the Bands debut, kicked off
the show at 10 p.m.
Although the opening slot meant that
they would have fewer onlookers, band
members said that there were pleased with
the reaction to their set.
"We knew drawing the early time slot,
that it was going to be tough to rally peo
ple that early," said band member and se
nior Jason Luker. "We were super
pleased, though."
They were followed by 60/40 Break
down, another rock group performing for
the first time.
Despite technical difficulties — one of
the amplifiers broke after their first song —
band member and junior Drew Baglino
said he was pleased with how the perfor
mance was received. ♦
"I thought it was a horrible set, but the
crowd seemed to respond well," he said.
Baglino said that the only negative aspect
of Battle of the Bands was the sound quality
of the venue, a concern voiced by several

members of other bands.
"Toyon has horrible echoing,
it's one of the worst places to put
bands," Baglino said.
After 60/40 Breakdown's set,
the defending champions o.n.e.
took the stage, shifting the sound
from rock to hip hop.
"We really wanted to get the
crowd into our performance," ju
nior Damon Jones said . "That was
our main goal, really, to put on a
good show for the crowd."
Jones said the group did not
feel uncomfortable playing after
two rock bands, emphasizing that
« rock and hip hop have similar
roots and that the DJ played hip
hop music between sets.
"Last year, we thought-that that
would be an obstacle that we had
to overcome," Jones said. "We
didn't want to compromise our
style any."
At one point, o.n.e. encour
aged the crowd to take out their
cell phones to serve as makeshift
lighters and was able to rouse the
crowd, asking them to clap, wave
and "bounce" during their set.
Leonard brought a rock sound

back to the show, performing
fourth. This was also its first ap
pearance at Battle of the Bands.
Leonard fans were excited
when the band finished their set
with a rendition of "Space Camp,"
a song Wheaton said the group
has become known for.
Finally, Ten Mile I ide, a band
composed of four Stanford gradu
ates of the classes of 1999 and 2000
and two friends, performed.
Ten Mile Tide competed at
Battle of the Bands last year.
Band member Steve Kessler
said he was pleased by the audi
ence they had.
"It was surprising to see how
many people were still there,"
he said.
The five judges were social
managers and resident assistants
from row houses.
"I felt like it could have gone
any way," Kessler said.
Overall, Phi Psi brothers and
band members were pleased with
both the quality of the music and
the audience.
"We were pretty much just
blown away," Luker said. "It was
cool to see the different genres,
too."
"I really think this is the most
talent we've had at a battle in all
the battles I've seen," said senior

Chris Montgomery, president of
Phi Psi.
The event was organized pri
marily by sophomores Andrew
Davidson and Mike Calhoun.
Junior Kathryn Yu said she
was disappointed that music
seemed to come second to enter
tainment.
"I felt like it was skewed more
towards showmanship and enter
taining the crowd," she said. "I just
expected more out of the contest."
Yu also said she was surprised
that, out of all the bands, there
were only two women who per
formed. "I kind of got the feeling
that it was a male-orientated activ
ity," she said.
Freshman Pablo Schyfter said
that he was surprised by quality of
the performances.
"I was just impressed by the
amount of talent that we have
here," he said. "It wasn't just a
band thing, it was also a party. It
was fun."
Pincus felt that the success of
the evening could be shown
through Kessler's antics at the Bat
tle's culmination.
"You don't get too much more
rock and roll than a violin smash
ing at the end," Pincus said.
"It was spirit that moved me,"
Kessler said.

"Toyon has horrible echoing,
it's one of the worst places to put
bands," Baglino said.
After 60/40 Breakdown's set,
the defending champions o.n.e.
took the stage, shifting the sound
from rock to hip hop.
"We really wanted to get the
crowd into our performance," ju
nior Damon Jones said . "That was
our main goal, really, to put on a
good show for the crowd."
Jones said the group did not
feel uncomfortable playing after
two rock bands, emphasizing that
« rock and hip hop have similar
roots and that the DJ played hip
hop music between sets.
"Last year, we thought-that that
would be an obstacle that we had
to overcome," Jones said. "We
didn't want to compromise our
style any."

Leonard brought a rock sound

back to the show, performing

Band member Steve Kessler
said he was pleased by the audi
ence they had.
"It was surprising to see how
many people were still there,"
he said.
The five judges were social
managers and resident assistants
from row houses.
"I felt like it could have gone
any way," Kessler said.
Overall, Phi Psi brothers and
band members were pleased with
both the quality of the music and
the audience.
"We were pretty much just
blown away," Luker said. "It was
cool to see the different genres,
too."
"I really think this is the most
talent we've had at a battle in all
the battles I've seen," said senior

Chris Montgomery, president of
Phi Psi.
The event was organized pri
marily by sophomores Andrew
Davidson and Mike Calhoun.
Junior Kathryn Yu said she
was disappointed that music
seemed to come second to enter
tainment.
"I felt like it was skewed more
towards showmanship and enter
taining the crowd," she said. "I just
expected more out of the contest."
Yu also said she was surprised
that, out of all the bands, there
were only two women who per
formed. "I kind of got the feeling
that it was a male-orientated activ
ity," she said.
Freshman Pablo Schyfter said
that he was surprised by quality of
the performances.
"I was just impressed by the
amount of talent that we have
here," he said. "It wasn't just a
band thing, it was also a party. It
was fun."
Pincus felt that the success of
the evening could be shown
through Kessler's antics at the Bat
tle's culmination.
"You don't get too much more
rock and roll than a violin smash
ing at the end," Pincus said.
"It was spirit that moved me,"
Kessler said.
Culminating its show with an impas
sioned violin smashing, the southern
rock band Ten Mile Tide beat out four

Ten Mile fide won first place with 274
points, o.n.e. placed second with 272,
Leonard placed third with 270 and 60/40
Breakdown and Blind Man's Dream placed

Many band members said that they
didn't participate to win. They were more
interested in playing their music and enter
taining the crowd.
"We really didn't go in there with the ex
pectation to win anything," said senior Jill

Wheaton, the lead singer of Leonard. "We
were happy to come in third, but that was
just the bonus after getting to be there."
Phi Psi auditioned approximately 15
bands, five of which were chosen for the
finals.
Blind Man's Dream, a rock group mak
ing its Battle of the Bands debut, kicked off
the show at 10 p.m.
Although the opening slot meant that
they would have fewer onlookers, band
members said that there were pleased with
the reaction to their set.
"We knew drawing the early time slot,
that it was going to be tough to rally peo
ple that early," said band member and se
