### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Culminating its show with an impas
sioned violin smashing, the southern
rock band Ten Mile Tide beat out four
other groups Saturday night to win Phi
Kappa Psi's 12th annual Battle of the
Bands competition.
Almost 1,000 spectators packed Toyon
Hall throughout the night to hear the
five finalists play 30-minute sets, with
Ten Mile Tide beating out the hip hop
group o.n.e. by a mere two points to cap
ture first place.
"It was probably one of our most success
ful battles ever," said senior Zach Pincus, Phi
Psi's public relations chair.
Ten Mile fide won first place with 274
points, o.n.e. placed second with 272,
Leonard placed third with 270 and 60/40
Breakdown and Blind Man's Dream placed
fourth and fifth, respectively.
Many band members said that they
didn't participate to win. They were more
interested in playing their music and enter
taining the crowd.
"We really didn't go in there with the ex
pectation to win anything," said senior Jill

Wheaton, the lead singer of Leonard. "We
were happy to come in third, but that was
just the bonus after getting to be there."
Phi Psi auditioned approximately 15
bands, five of which were chosen for the
finals.
Blind Man's Dream, a rock group mak
ing its Battle of the Bands debut, kicked off
the show at 10 p.m.
Although the opening slot meant that
they would have fewer onlookers, band
members said that there were pleased with
the reaction to their set.
"We knew drawing the early time slot,
that it was going to be tough to rally peo
ple that early," said band member and se
nior Jason Luker. "We were super
pleased, though."
They were followed by 60/40 Break
down, another rock group performing for
the first time.
Despite technical difficulties — one of
the amplifiers broke after their first song —
band member and junior Drew Baglino
said he was pleased with how the perfor
mance was received. ♦
"I thought it was a horrible set, but the
crowd seemed to respond well," he said.
Baglino said that the only negative aspect
of Battle of the Bands was the sound quality
of the venue, a concern voiced by several
