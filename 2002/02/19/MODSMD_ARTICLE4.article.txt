University's highest honor.
Gardner was named the first. Miriam
and Peter Haas Centennial Professor in
Public Service in 1989.
He was the Stanford commencement
speaker in 1991.
"The test is whether in all the confu
sion and clash of interests, all the dis
tracting conflicts and cross-purposes,
all the temptations to self-indulgence
and self-exoneration, we have the
strength of purpose, the guts, the con
viction, the spiritual staying power to
build a future worthy of our past,"
Gardner said in his speech.
