# Program educates high schoolers

Math, science, english and history are
among the classes high school students
are normally required to take. Beyond
these more commonplace subjects,
many students also want the opportuni
ty to delve into more unique and specific
topics, such as the plight of deep-sea an
imals in Monterey Bay or the art of
telling jokes.
Stanford's Educational Studies Pro
gram allows high school students to ex
plore such options. It was started in 1996

and was based upon a similar program
that has been in place at M.I.T. since
1957. According to its Web site, the pro
gram's goal is to "provide extracurricular
enrichment programs for secondary
school students in the Bay Area."
The program runs two projects din -
ing the year. One of them is the five-week
Stanford High School Enrichment Pro
gram. High school students can choose
from a range of over 3ft courses in seven
different subject areas, allowing them to
expand 011 old interests and explore new
intellectual possibilities. They are al

lowed to register for three classes, which
they attend on Saturdays.
The second program is titled,
"Splash" and is a one-day event taking
place on May 18. Students attend work
shops, seminars and lectures on subjects
including, "Excuses for Not Doing Your
Homework," and, "Sixty Minutes of Cal
culus in Its Awesome Entirety."
Taught by Stanford students, the pro
grams' structure allows it to benefit both
teachers and students.
