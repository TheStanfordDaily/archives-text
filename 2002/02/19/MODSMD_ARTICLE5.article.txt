# Program educates high schoolers

### AMELIA DELAPAZ 
Math, science, english and history are
among the classes high school students
are normally required to take. Beyond
these more commonplace subjects,
many students also want the opportuni
ty to delve into more unique and specific
topics, such as the plight of deep-sea an
imals in Monterey Bay or the art of
telling jokes.
Stanford's Educational Studies Pro
gram allows high school students to ex
plore such options. It was started in 1996

and was based upon a similar program
that has been in place at M.I.T. since
1957. According to its Web site, the pro
gram's goal is to "provide extracurricular
enrichment programs for secondary
school students in the Bay Area."
The program runs two projects din -
ing the year. One of them is the five-week
Stanford High School Enrichment Pro
gram. High school students can choose
from a range of over 3ft courses in seven
different subject areas, allowing them to
expand 011 old interests and explore new
intellectual possibilities. They are al

lowed to register for three classes, which
they attend on Saturdays.
The second program is titled,
"Splash" and is a one-day event taking
place on May 18. Students attend work
shops, seminars and lectures on subjects
including, "Excuses for Not Doing Your
Homework," and, "Sixty Minutes of Cal
culus in Its Awesome Entirety."
Taught by Stanford students, the pro
grams' structure allows it to benefit both
teachers and students.
"Our programs do focus a great
deal on high school enrichment,
but they also focus on letting Stan
ford students share their passions,
hobbies and interests with others,"
said Melanie Wong, the program's
teacher recruitment coordinator.
Anyone is eligible to teach for
the program. Both Stanford stu
dents and others who have an in
terest in working with high school
students may apply.
Senior Scott Cederberg, chair

person of the program, said that
his interest in the program grows
from the nature of its teaching.
"I got involved with the pro
gram freshman year after talking
to a friend of mine who had taught
in Splash," Cederberg said. "I
liked teaching and explaining
things, so I then taught in [the en
richment program]."
The potential instructors com
plete the application, which in
cludes a proposal for the class they
envision teaching.
Then they schedule inter
views with administrators and
other applicants. This process
not only allows administrators

to learn about the classes, but
also allows prospective teachers
to see the range of classes that
will be offered.
"Typically everyone who ap
plies is allowed to teach," Ceder
berg said. "We just want to make
sure that their class will be safe for
students and that they have some
kind of a plan for it."
Applications for teaching
and enrollment in [the enrich
ment program] are no longer
accepted, since the program is
nearing the end of its 2002 ses
sion. However, applications to
teach Splash are available until
March 15.
