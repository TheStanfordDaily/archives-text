## 
### ERIN ARCHERD STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Queer-Straight
Social and Political Alliance will be
handing out buttons and signs
today in White Plaza as part of the
"I Still Support Straight Allies"
campaign.
Ilie buttons and stickers read
"Straight Allies Rock!" and the
door signs proclaim "I Support
Queer Rights."
The alliance will also be handing
out advertisements about a social
event that will take place tomorrow
evening from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. in
the Women's Community Center.
The alliance is a group that seeks
to bring together students of all sex
ual orientations.
"We are committed to providing
bi-weekly social activities for queer
and allies students, as well as
monthly parties," said co-founder
Jesse Evans, a junior.
During alliance social events, rto
one is allowed to ask the sexual ori
entation of another person. People
may choose to discuss their orienta
tion, if they are comfortable.
The table in White Pla/a is a way
to increase the alliance's visibility,
according to Evans.

"Queer people need to know
that they are not alone, and that
there is a strong and dedicated
community out there for them,"
he said.
Past events sponsored by the al
liance have included the Queer
and Ally BBQ, the Love/Lust
party, the "Turn OH the Lights
Party," a Chuck E. Cheese trip and
game nights.
Future events include a CD to
be distributed during Admit
Weekend that includes clips about
queer life at Stanford.
The focus of tonight's social
event will be straight allies, hetero
sexuals who support gay rights.
"We will be playing games, eat
ing food and writing our thoughts
on straight allies 'being one, loving
one' on a big canvas that we will
post in White Plaza," Evans said.
Evans explained the reasons for
this quarter's campaign, stressing
the importance of straight allies in
the alliance.
"We feel that it is important to
continually remind the Stanford
community of the vital role that
straight allies play in both the al
liance and the queer movement at
large," he said.
The alliance is also working on a
dialogue-based speaker panel that
will serve as a follow-up to the Les
bian, Clay, Bisexual and Transgen
der speaker panel.
"[The] Straight Allies Speaker's
Bureau will go to dorms and class
rooms engaging students in discus
sions on being a good straight ally,
being a good coming-out resource,
the current state of queer rights,

and what it is like to be queer,"
Evans said.
Sophomore Cisco Barron
agreed that the campaign was
needed. "The stickers are a good
thing," he said.
" fhe gay community is one of
the most marginalized community
in our [school]. They need all the
support they can get."
The alliance encourages stu
dents to fill out their survey to as
sess the resources for the queer
and ally community.
