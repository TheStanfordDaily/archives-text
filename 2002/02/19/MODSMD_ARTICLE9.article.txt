# Insurance plan causes debate
## 
### CINDY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Bush administration's proposal to expand
the Children's Health Insurance Program has
sparked controversy since it was announced at the
end of January.
As reported in The Daily last Friday, the regulation
will allow states to extend CHIP coverage to prenatal
care and delivery services by defining a "child" from
conception to the age of 19.
The proposed definition of "child" differs from the
standard defined in the Roe vs. Wade decision and
now used by the National Institutes for Health, the
Food and Drug Administration, and North American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This defi
nition is determined by the viability of the fetus outside
of the uterus.
Controversy over the definition has lead some to
believe that the administration's prenatal care policy
is a means of furthering a pro-life agenda.
"The only reason it was proposed was to allow the
Department of Health and Human Services to define
a new category of child as that beginning at concep
tion," said Center for Reproductive Health Research

& Policy Co-Director Felicia Stewart.
"Is the Secretary for Health and Human Ser
vices qualified to make a statement about when life
begins?" said Consultant Human Biology Prof.
Philip Lee, formerly assistant secretary for health
and human services during the Johnson and Clin
ton administrations.
Lee saw the regulation as an attempt by Bush to
please conservatives, rather than a genuine concern
for improving the health status of pregnant, low-in
come women.
"It was a very potentially and deliberately con
tentious act to satisfy very conservative supporters,
which was not necessary to extend coverage to preg
nant women," Lee said.
States are already able to apply for waivers
through the federal government if they wish to ex
tend coverage to the parents of enrolled children or
pregnant women through the state's CM 1P or Medic
aid program.
Pro-choice organizations across the nation have
voiced anger over how the proposed regulation will
set a legal precedent for recognizing a fetus as a per-
son, thus threatening the Roe vs.
Wade decision.
Still, some pro-life advocates
emphasize that prenatal care is the
more pressing issue, not resolving
tfie ideological debate over the de
finition of "child."
"Legally speaking, Planned Par
enthood vs. Casey, the 1992 deci
sion generally affirming Roe vs.
Wade, remains the law of the land,"
said Students for Life Campus Rep

resentative Andre Vanier, a student
in both the Graduate School of
Business and the Law School.
"Socially, however, the Health
and Human Services policy is im
portant because it affirms that our
society has a stake in helping preg
nant mothers and their unborn
children. This affirmation is some
thing that should unite individuals
who agree to disagree on the pub
lic policy issue of abortion itself."
The new regulation will not
take effect until it is published in
the Federal Register in a few
weeks and public comments are
considered.
