for the PHI BETA KAPPA
TEACHING PRIZE
The Stanford Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa is currently soliciting nominations for this year's Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Prize. The
prize recognizes not only excellence in teaching but also the ability to inspire personal and intellectual development beyond
the classroom. This may include, but is not limited to, encouraging critical and analytic thinking, taking an active interest in
students as individuals, and influencing the way students think about the world.
Nominations of all instructors, lecturers, or professors are invited from members of the Class of 2002. Seniors should write
their nomination in the form of a letter offering concrete examples of why the nominee is particularly deserving. Nominations
will be reviewed by current members of Stanford's PBK Chapter. The Prize, which carries a cash award, will be presented
during the annual spring initiation ceremony. Letters of nomination are due by March 15,2002, and should be submitted via
e-mail to Susie Brubaker-Cole at susiebc@stanford.edu.
For more information, please contact Susie Brubaker-Cole, PBK Secretary, at susiebc@stanford.edu.
