# What's Up, Doc: Design marvels

If you haven't heard about it already, here's the
second-generation iMac. The product-design marvel
boasts a 10.6-inch spherical base, and holds the essen
tials — an 800MHz G4 processor, a 60GB hard drive
and a DVD-R/CD-RW Super Drive that plays and
burns DVDs and CDs. A fully adjustable 15-inch LCD
flat screen provides sharp, brilliant images. It also has
3-D graphics capabilities three times more powerful
than those of previous models. Prices range from
$1,299 to $1,799.
The 500-horsepower Ford GT4O supercar that
dominated the Le Mans racetrack from 1966 to 1969
is back in prototype form. Ford's no-frills working
concept strayed little from the original design, and is
built mostly from off-the-shelf parts, so that produc
tion is very simple. Like the original, it's propelled by
a midmounted 5.4-liter V8 engine that delivers two
Porsche Boxsters' worth of horsepower. Perfor
mance numbers for the GT4O are yet to be released.

Boeing has announced plans to design a small,
fuel-cell-powered propeller plane. Inside fuel
cells, hydrogen fuel and oxygen react to produce
electricity. In thinner air at 35,000 to 50,000 feet,
a compressor is needed to ensure a constant sup
ply of oxygen. In a commercial airliner, fuel cell
power units could be used in flight for everything
from heating meals to powering the cockpit's com
puter. Boeing hopes to get its test plane off the
ground by 2004.
With funding from the NASA Institute for Ad
vanced Concepts, engineers at the Georgia Institute
ofTechnology and Ohio Aerospace Institute are lead
ing a project to build Entomopters robots that would
be launched from a Martian land rover, fly hundreds
of yards over treacherous terrain, touch down to take
samples, then return to the rover to refuel and upload
data. Fhe Entomopters design, adapted to Mars'
unique atmosphere, is based on recent discoveries in
insect flight. The engineers are also developing an
ultra-efficient "reciprocating chemical muscle" to
power the airborne bot.
