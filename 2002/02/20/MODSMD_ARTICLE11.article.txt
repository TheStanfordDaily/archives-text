## The 						Stanford Daily Alcohol suspensions should be used with care 
### 
Published Since J891

The Stanford Band was placed on al
cohol suspension two weeks ago by
the Office of Student Activities, not
long after the same penalty was im
posed on the Kappa Sigma fraternity. These
decisions can serve as important reminders to
students and campus groups of their purpose
in the Stanford community, but the University
should establish a review process of student
groups so that alcohol suspension is not per
ceived as a threat handed down at the admin
istration's whim.
The administration's primary concern in
investigating both situations was for student
safety. The review of the Band was not an at
tempt to constrain the group's behavior, but
to work with the student group to ensure that
its members are engaging in safe activities.
The Dean of Students Office emphasized

that "the decision was made in an effort to
hold the Band accountable to the same stan
dards as yther campus groups and individual
students."
We believe the particular decision regarding
the Band provides the University with an op
portunity to delineate to students exacdy what
standards they are bang held to and what priv
ileges the Stanford alcohol policy affords them.
Explaining what kind of behavior prompts
such a suspension would turn a disciplinary ac
tion into a chance to educate the communitv.
Concerning the actions that led to the
Band's suspension, Dean of Students Marc
Wais said, "We received information and re
ports from other offices on campus. Once
these incidents are reported, it is our responsi
bility to follow up on them."
If alcohol is repeatedly the centerpiece of an

organization's functions, an action such as alco
hol suspension can serve as an appropriate re
minder of the group's true role in campus life —
no group that we know of requires excessive al
cohol consumption to fulfill its purpose.
While a review seems necessary in such a sit
uation, we hope it does not make the fear of al
cohol suspension a major factor in the way stu
dents handle potentially dangerous situations.
The University's liberal alcohol policy places
safety and responsibility before enforcement.
However, if suspensions become more preva
lent, we worry that students may waver on
whether or not to take all the steps necessary to
ensure the safety of their peers in a situation
where alcohol is involved.
By continuing to work with students, the
Dean of Students Office should make it clear
that alcohol suspension is not a threat looming

over student groups, but an opportunity for
groups to rethink their mission and partake in
activities not centered around alcohol.
Perhaps a peer review board, similar to the
Greek Judicial Board, should be created so
that an infrastructure is in place to aid the ad
ministration in its decision-making process in
the future.
Lastly, to address the Band's specific situa
tion, we hope this result does not alter its char
acter, which the Stanford community values a
great deal. Then again, if alcohol is so integral
to the makeup of the Band that such a change
does occur, perhaps this suspension and re
view were both necessary.
In any case, we hope that the punishment
serves to promote healthy reform rather than
setting an unhealthy precedent of unilateral
intervention in the life of student groups.
