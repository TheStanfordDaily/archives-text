# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Urinal design could use a pee-er review process 
### 
As a Daily columnist, I have an
obligation to the Stanford com
munity to inform, to enlighten
and to encourage understand
ing. Sometimes, (although, hopefully,
usually not) this will call for some serious
investigation. I'm not afraid to leave what
you might call my "comfort zone" (or, my
chair).
Today, the inaugural edition of "Run
ning on Empty" travels into uncharted
territory in an attempt to unite the two
halves of the human race and explore the
very essence of what it is to be a male.
This week's question: What's going on
in the guys' bathroom?

In the name of scien
tific: research, I went on
a guided tour of the sec
ond- and third-floor
men's bathrooms in my
house, a very comfort
able Row residence
which for the purposes
of anonymity I shall call
"Rob." The status of the

men's bathrooms in Rob has been the
subject of vigorous debate at house meet
ings and dinner tables.
Apparently, they stink.
They stink, they are strewn with paper
towels and assorted litter and there seems
to be a problem with certain bodily fluids
being properly aimed at the fluid-catching
appliances, if you get my drift.
As a concerned staff member and dedi
cated journalist, I checked out these issues
for myself, in the hopes that some sort of
global gender harmony could be accom
plished by understanding how boys pee.
And wow, ladies, do we have a lot
to learn.
Lesson one: the most pivotal issue fac
ing urinal users today? Splashback.
This is a phenomenon caused by the
abrupt contact of a stream of a certain liq
uid against the ceramic wall of the urinal.
If the stream is robust enough, there will
be splashback, in which small droplets of
the liquid deflect from the wall onto what
an anonymous male source described as
the "crotchular area."
Which brings up the first question: if
humanity has managed to design and

build the Hoover Dam, the artificial heart,
the space shuttle and the Pyramids, then
why are men still on themselves?
Has no national government looked into
the issue? What are our tax dollars doing?
Compounding the problem, splash
back leads to what an alert male de
scribed as the "vicious cycle" of thft uri
nal: Guy No. 1 steps away in order to
avoid splashback, spilling (ugh) a few
drops on the floor. Guy No. 2 steps far
ther back to avoid Guy No. l's splatter,
and adds to the mess on the floor. By the
end of the day, guys are aiming from
across the room, the floor is a Slip n' Slide
and the Country Fresh Glade Plug-In
previously installed by a desperate house
manager is overpowered by the stench of
a flood of stinky pee.
Sweet baby Jesus! Must we live like sav
age beasts? Is this our only option in a civ
ilized society? Why have not hordes of
angry, urine-splattered males risen up
against urinal manufacturers everywhere
and stormed their product design offices,
chanting "Three, six, nine, twelve, we
don't want to pee on ourselves!
The women's bathroom in Rob does
not have this problem. In fact, to a casual
observer it might seem that the bathroom
is used for no other purpose than the stor
age of fruit-scented body wash.
This would be true, were it not for the
persistent accumulation of "shower
trash": hair-glutted rubber bands, used
make-up pads smudged with mascara,
and clumps of wet tissue crammed into the
soap dish.
Who are you, shower trash fiend? Is the
trash can really too far away? Do you
change identity in the shower and are
forced to leave the evidence of your old
self behind?
I hope this has been enlightening for
you. Just think of what a world this would
be if we could overcome our prejudices
and fears and work together to build% bet
ter urinal. And if you take nothing else
from this today, please, please, don't for
get to flush.
