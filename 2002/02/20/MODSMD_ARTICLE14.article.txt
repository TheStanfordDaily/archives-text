Daily 'misrepresented' events at
ASSU / Hennessy meeting
I am writing in response to The Daily's
coverage of events involving the Coalition
for Labor Justice in the past week and in
general. I feel like The Daily has continu
ally misrepresented — and even made up
— the facts of the events covered that se
riously alter the way an objective reader
might react to what they are reading. This
is exactly what a newspaper is not sup
posed to do. 1 will admit that I am a mem
ber of the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion and therefore have followed this
issue closely and will be extra critical.
However, I have some concrete examples
of poor journalism.
Thursday's editorial ("ASSU, SLAC
behavior harms student causes,") has sev
eral examples of this. I am not simply
writing this because I disagree with the
author's viewpoint. It is fine for the paper
to write an opinion article that I do not
agree with, but that article should be
based on accurate facts.
When The Daily writes, "the group dis
respected Hennessy and walked out of the
meeting c hanting with signs held high," it
is misleading. The meeting ended with
ASSU Senator Alex Shvartsman gaining
control and asking if there were any more
questions. When no one said anything, it
was I lennessy who walked out of the
room, and actually several of us stayed
after and talked with your reporter. How
can an inconsistency like this exist? And
what does that say about your reporting?
The editorial also said, "Immediately

approximately 45 black-clad students
jumped to their feet and began firing
demands at Hennessy, complete with
placards iterating their position." This is
a strong misrepresentation. No one's
feet left the ground. Harping on the
word "jump" may seem nitpicky, but lit
tle things like this color the actions in an
unfair way. Furthermore, we didn't "fire
demands." Instead, three spokespeople
stood up with everyone else and asked
questions in a firm tone of voice that was
not so different from any other ques
tions asked.
In the news article on Wednesday
("Hennessy meets with students," quotes
taken from all different parts of the meeting
were strung together as if they were spoken
in a back-and-forth argument.
There were similar instances last quar
ter of unfair reporting. Rather than
dwelling on the past, I think in the future,
The Daily should be more conscious of
getting accurate facts and not allowing in
accuracies or misrepresentations to color
an issue in way it otherwise would not have
been. Stanford's administration has a
huge amount of power over people's lives;
our voice is only power we have as stu
dents. The Daily is in a critical position as
our movement depends on many students
who do not attend every event. When The
Daily prints distortions and unreliable in
formation, it jeopardizes the voice of stu
dents and ultimately the lives of the poor
est members of our community.

'Axis of evil' speech was courageous,
not simplistic
Numerous voices, here and abroad,
are questioning the "axis of evil" mes
sage of President George W. Bush.
But that message reflects an age-old
"moment of truth" courageous response
to any declaration of war, personal
or national.
Franklin Roosevelt used similar lan
guage when he picked up the gauntlet
thrown before him by Japan and
Germany.
Iran's mullahs have often declared their
eagerness to destroy us and the West gen
erally and are actively seeking the means,
especially nuclear, to do so. Bush plausibly
noted that we can't alibi cl to just sit back
and wait for them to try.
Similarly with Saddam Hussein. 11
the Israelis hadn't taken out his reactor

a lew years before the Gull' War, we
would have had rough going dislodging
him from Kuwait. Why give him anoth
er chance?
This isn't merely the cause of the New
York firefighters, this is survival of
the West.
Everyone knows that Arafat had long
ago (in speeches in Arabic) declared war
on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon had no choice but to accept that

war with its casualties, as Bush now has
done. As we almost all did, in 1941 after
the attack on Pearl Harbor.
To many Europeans, whom we
helped to save back then despite their
generally limp attitudes, this is "simplis
tic." The simple truth always looks that
way to the fainthearted.
