## Seniors take last swing at NCAA title 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the No. 3 Cardinal women's
tennis team (6-1) hosts Hawaii (0-3)
today and travels to No. 13 California
(4-0) this Saturday, it will look to its
three seniors for leadership and top
flight play.
Lauren Kalvaria, Gabriela Lastra
and Keiko Tokuda are in their fourth
and final year at Stanford, and in ad
dition to having already been a part of
two NCAA championship teams, they
have also accumulated a wealth of
knowledge and fond memories.
"It's been an incredible experience
for me," Kalvaria said. "I feel like I've
grown so much as a player and a per
son in my four years here."
"I loved everything about [my ex
perience here]," Tokuda concurred.

"I'm glad about the choice I made in
coming here."
Although the seniors may have had
a hard time pinpointing exactly what
made their Stanford experience what
it was, they all were in definite agree
ment about the highlight of their
tenure on the Farm.
"Nothing tops our freshman expe
rience, winning the NCAAs," Kalvaria
said. "Beating the favorites on their
home courts and being down [to]
match points in several matches was
just an incredible experience."

"It was one of those moments that
you can't believe actually happened,
[because] it's so special and meaning
ful," Tokuda explained.
In addition to the highlights, the
seniors also learned a great deal about
themselves through the everyday
tasks of a student-athlete.
"I always wondered if I could real
ly make it here at Stanford, and in
coming here, I've realized that I can
be proud of what I've done," Tokuda
said.
"It's taught me that I have to be dis
ciplined and know how to manage my
time well," Lastra said. "Everything I
do, I've learned how to do pretty
well."

play: "Definitely to win the
NCAAs," Tokuda said. "Everyone
will say that."
The seniors are all ranked in
singles play: Kalvaria is No. 4 in
the nation, Lastra No. 11 and
Tokuda No. 52. Kalvaria and Las
tra also combine to form the na
tion's top doubles team.
They all expressed a desire to
give professional tennis a shot.
"1 would love to play some pro
fessional tennis," Tokuda said.
"I'd love to see some closure for
the last 1(5 years of my life."
"I want to take the skills I've
learned here and go out onto the
professional tour and see what I
can do," Lastra said.
Although many tennis players
turn pro in their teenage years,
the seniors feel that their four
years at college gave them time to
develop and mature as players,
making them more prepared for
the tour. They credited the stiff
competition and the coaches

they've had with helping them
improve.
"I've had time to mature,"
Kalvaria said. "The biggest lesson
I've learned from the coaching
staff is to remain focused and keep
my emotion on an even level."
"It's made me stronger and
given me more confidence," Las
tra said. "I feel like I'm ready [to
go pro] now. I don't think I was
ready before."
The seniors had nothing but
praise for current head coach
Lele Forood and assistant Frankie
Brennan, as well as retired head
coach Frank Brennan.
Frank, "always knew what to
say," Lastra said.
"I think Lele's just unbeliev
able," Tokuda said. "She's done
miracles for my game."
The seniors have formed a
close bond with each by virtue of
their time together on the farm as
teammates and friends.
"For me personally, coming
into Stanford, I knew many of the
girls on the team and that was one
of the draws here," Kalvaria said.
"Tennis is usually seen as an
individual sport, but it's nice to

have the team unity, somebody
behind you, wanting you to win,"
Lastra said. "It's nice having that
support."
The seniors pinpointed differ
ent things as being the best things
about the Stanford women's ten
nis program.
"I think it's the tradition," Las
tra said. "If you ask any junior
[tennis player], they all want to go
to Stanford."
" I definitely think it's the feel
ing that we're not so special,"
Tokuda said, saying that she
liked how the team was not arro
gant or pressuring but rather
was friendly and competitive
without getting too caught up in
itself.
"I think it's how well we get
along as a team," Kalvaria said.
"We're all really close and that
helps when you're competing."
Stanford will miss these three
talented seniors next year, and
they will probably miss each other
and Stanford, too.
"I can't imagine being on a
team without these two other se
niors," Kalvaria said. "They're
like family."
