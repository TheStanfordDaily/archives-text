## Seniors take last swing at NCAA title 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the No. 3 Cardinal women's
tennis team (6-1) hosts Hawaii (0-3)
today and travels to No. 13 California
(4-0) this Saturday, it will look to its
three seniors for leadership and top
flight play.
Lauren Kalvaria, Gabriela Lastra
and Keiko Tokuda are in their fourth
and final year at Stanford, and in ad
dition to having already been a part of
two NCAA championship teams, they
have also accumulated a wealth of
knowledge and fond memories.
"It's been an incredible experience
for me," Kalvaria said. "I feel like I've
grown so much as a player and a per
son in my four years here."
"I loved everything about [my ex
perience here]," Tokuda concurred.

"I'm glad about the choice I made in
coming here."
Although the seniors may have had
a hard time pinpointing exactly what
made their Stanford experience what
it was, they all were in definite agree
ment about the highlight of their
tenure on the Farm.
"Nothing tops our freshman expe
rience, winning the NCAAs," Kalvaria
said. "Beating the favorites on their
home courts and being down [to]
match points in several matches was
just an incredible experience."

"It was one of those moments that
you can't believe actually happened,
[because] it's so special and meaning
ful," Tokuda explained.
In addition to the highlights, the
seniors also learned a great deal about
themselves through the everyday
tasks of a student-athlete.
"I always wondered if I could real
ly make it here at Stanford, and in
coming here, I've realized that I can
be proud of what I've done," Tokuda
said.
"It's taught me that I have to be dis
ciplined and know how to manage my
time well," Lastra said. "Everything I
do, I've learned how to do pretty
well."
All three seniors share an obvious
goal for this, their final year of college
