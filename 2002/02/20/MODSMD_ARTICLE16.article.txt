event with a jump of 12 feet, 5.5

Johnson placed ninth in the 55-
meter dash in 7.34 seconds, just
missing the qualifying mark for
the final heat. She had more suc
cess in the 55-meter high hurdles,
taking first place in a time of 8.02.
Overly's marks of 18-01.75 and
38-10.25 in the long jump and

fourth place finishes, respectively.
The Cardinal men also claimed
a second-place finish in the long
jump, secured by junior Milton
Little's jump of 23-08.25. He was
followed by his teammate, fresh

sixth spot in the 55-meter dash in a
time of 6.55 seconds.
In the pole vault, sophomore
Tyler Gray placed tenth with a

how it's supposed to be done with
a first-place jump of 18-06.5, com

of the top marks in the nation,
particularly in the distance

The Stanford women have
their own national-title con

top indoor 3,000-meter and sec

boast greater depth in the sprints,
jumps and throws.
The Cardinal, however, ap
pears only to be gaining
strength as the season pro
gresses, and will enter the
MPSF championships with a
conference title in its sights.
