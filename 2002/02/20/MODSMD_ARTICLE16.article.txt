TRACK & FIELD

Saturday & Sunday:
MPSF Championships, All
Day, Flagstaff, AZ

All that remains are the champi
onship meets, starting with the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championships this weekend
in Flagstaff, Ariz.
In Reno, junior Kathleen
Donoghue continued her success
in the pole vault, winning the
event with a jump of 12 feet, 5.5
inches. Sophomore Leila Ben-
Youssef placed fourth with a mark
of 11-11.75.
Sophomore Lindsey John
son and senior Shannon Overly
were the Cardinal's busiest ath
letes at the meet, each compet
ing in two events.
Johnson placed ninth in the 55-
meter dash in 7.34 seconds, just
missing the qualifying mark for
the final heat. She had more suc
cess in the 55-meter high hurdles,
taking first place in a time of 8.02.
Overly's marks of 18-01.75 and
38-10.25 in the long jump and
triple jump earned her second and
fourth place finishes, respectively.
The Cardinal men also claimed
a second-place finish in the long
jump, secured by junior Milton
Little's jump of 23-08.25. He was
followed by his teammate, fresh
man Crochet Gerren (21-00) who
placed seventh. Little also took the
sixth spot in the 55-meter dash in a
time of 6.55 seconds.
In the pole vault, sophomore
Tyler Gray placed tenth with a
mark of 14-07.25. A rising star in
the pole vault for the Cardinal,
Gray still fell short of the marks

posted by his coach, Toby Steven
son, a former Cardinal athlete and
the 1998 N( lAA pole vault champi
on. Stevenson showed his student
how it's supposed to be done with
a first-place jump of 18-06.5, com
peting unattached.
Senior Raymond Bergstrom
represented the Cardinal in the
high jump, placing fourth with a
season-high mark of 6-07.
As expected, Stanford heads
into the championship portion

of the indoor season with some
of the top marks in the nation,
particularly in the distance
running events.
Redshirt sophomore Grant Ro
bison owns the fifth-fastest mile
time and seventh-fastest 3,000-me

Sophomore Chris Emme and
junior Louis Luchini hold the re
spective 10th and 11th best times
