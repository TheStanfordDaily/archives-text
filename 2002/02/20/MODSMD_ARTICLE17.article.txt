onships, ended l'ii a surprise victo
ry for the younger player.
The only singles loss for Stan
ford came in a hard-fought battle
between Cardinal freshman Phil
Sheng and Bulldog Greg Shearer.
After an easy first set victory, a ris
ing number of unforced errors
caused Sheng to fall, 7-5,3-6,3-6.
Stanford put in a strong
showing in doubles as well, de
spite having wrapped up the
mfatch in singles. The No. 3
team of Lipsky and David Mar
tin destroyed their opponents
8-0, while the seventh-ranked
team of Hippensteel and junior

Ryan Haviland had a strong
showing with an 8-3 victory.
The Bulldogs managed to
pull in one doubles match victo
ry in a see-saw battle against
Stanford freshmen Sheng and
Sam Warburg. Sheng and War
burg caught up from a 1 -4 deficit
only to fall behind again, 9-7.
"We played a reasonably good
match," said head coach Dick
Gould. "Fresno State is good
enough that on any given day they
could have given us some trouble."
If Saturday's match was
"reasonably good," then yester
day's outing might have been
just what Gould was looking
for, as players in all six singles
positions recorded wins for the
Cardinal before the doubles
were cancelled due to weather.
Highlighting the day for the

Cardinal, was the debut of
sophomore Joe Kao, who made
his first career start. Kao wasted
no time, defeating San Diego's
Martin Linusson, 6-1, 6-2.
Hippensteel and Martin
added straight set victories for
the Cardinal at the No. 1 and
No. 4 positions, respectively.
Rounding out the sweep in
three sets were Lipsky, Havi
land and Sheng.
After the rout of the Bull
dogs and the Toreros, Stanford
is quickly gaining steam as it
heads towards its first league
match against California on
February 23rd.
"We need some time and ex
perience to get ready for the
Cal match," Gould said. "We're
working on cutting down er
rors right now."
