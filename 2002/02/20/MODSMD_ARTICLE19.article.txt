# Stanford pins down the Vikings
## The 						Cardinal begins preparation for the Pac-10 tourney after a win over conference rival Portland State 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
By the time 157-pound Levi-Weikel Magden
stepped onto the mat Saturday to wrestle his last
home match, the Cardinal had already clinched a vic
tory over conference foe Portland State.
No matter, the fifth-year senior proceeded to do
what he has done a personal-best 25 times this sea
son: win.
In its last meet of the regular season, Stanford (10-
8, 3-4 Pacific 10 Conference) overcame an early 9-3
cleficit and took seven of 10 bouts against the Vikings
to secure a winning record in Steve Buddie's first
year as head coach.
"I had some personal goals for the team and in our

Saturday: Stanford 28, Portland State 9

very first week or two together, the team seemed to
echo those same goals," Buddie said. "A winning
record looked attainable to me so I'm not surprised
that we met that goal, but I'm very pleased."
As a Pac-IO champion at 167 pounds, Buddie was
a part of the last Stanford team to finish with a win
ning record 11 years ago, during his senior year.
Sophomore John Garfinkel opened the meet with
a 5-2 decision for Stanford at 165 pounds, but Port
land State's Quinn Collett responded at 174 pounds
with the first of three consecutive Viking decisions.
Portland State's Jeremy Wilson, ranked No. 19 in
the nation at 184 pounds, tallied a 6-1 victory before
Cardinal sophomore Matt Twomey dropped a hard
fought 13-12 decision at 197 pounds.
As the Ford Center scoreboard presented the pos-
sibilitv of a spoiled Senior Night
and the goal of a winning season
slipping away, redshirt junior
Brad Selby took matters into his
own hands.
Wrestling in his last collegiate
home meet, Selby earned a 4-2 de
cision at 285 pounds over Eric
Mustoe. Selby's ninth dual meet
win of the season would turn out
to be the first of six straight Cardi
nal wins to close out the match.
Sophomore Nathan Peterson
recorded a decision at 125 pounds
and junior Justin Walker tallied a
major decision at 133 pounds to
give Stanford a 13-9 lead.
After a Portland State forfeit at
141 pounds gave redshirt fresh
man Brad Metzler a win, fresh
man Matt Gentry pinned Port
land State's Casey Banks to put
the Cardinal in command at 25-9.
Gentry, who last week became
the first Stanford freshman to
record 30 wins in a single season,
extended his personal match win
streak to 14 bouts. The pin was
second-ranked Gentry's fourth of
the season.
Weikel-Magden finished off the
scoring with his 11th straight victo
ry, closing the book on a successful
regular season and sending the
Stanford crowd home happy.
In addition to Weikel-Magden
and Selby, Stanford also honored
seniors Kenji Arai, Mike Copper
man and Patricia Miranda before
the meet.
Stanford now begins prepara
tion for the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Corvallis, Ore. on
March 2-3, where the team will
look to improve on last year's
ninth-place finish. Final seeds for
the tournament will not be deter

mined until the day before, when
a meeting of all of the coaches will
take place.
In the days leading up to the
tournament, the team will practice
with greater intensity, but with
less actual time on the mat, ac
cording to Buddie.

"We'll take two days off for
the weekend to let them catch
up and feel like their minds are
at ease going into the next
week," Buddie said.
With their minds at ease, the
Stanford grapplers will aim for
loftier goals in Corvallis.
