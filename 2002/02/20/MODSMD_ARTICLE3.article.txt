# Late Late Show to feature Stanford
## University will be 12th in college-themed series 
### SCOTT DORFMAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
After almost three years of grilling celebri
ties, fondling supermodels and primping his
trademark dirty blond hair in a desk-mount
ed mirror, CBS's Craig Kilborn will turn the
mirror on a new subject tonight — the Stan
ford Cardinal.
Stanford will be the 12th university fea
tured in a series of college-themed editions of
"The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn."
Stanford will be profiled as a run-up to Satur
day's basketball game against UCLA. The
themed shows have been running every
Wednesday night since November and have
featured schools including the University of
Florida, Seton Hall University and Michigan
State University.
"I strongly believe that higher education
improves one's ability to watch and under
stand late night television, and America's col
lege students have my solemn oath that our

comedy keg will never run dry," Kilborn said
before the first college-themed show.
Kilborn said it will be a "game-time deci
sion" as to how Stanford will be portrayed by
the show, but previous college editions have
featured university-themed set decorations,
video submissions from students and Kil
born's trademark "five questions" segments
tailored to each school. The host will also pre
dict the winner of Saturday's game, carrying
a 9-2 record in previous predictions into
tonight's show.
Although the majority of Kilborn's career
has been spent working for ESPN's "Sports-
Center" in Bristol, Conn., Comedy Central's
"The Daily Show" in New York and the Los
Angeles-based "Late Late Show," Kilborn
said he is actually no stranger to Stanford.
"I actually lived in Menlo Park fora year
in the mid-1980s," Kilborn said. "I remem
ber University Avenue. I saw 'Caligula' at
the Stanford Theatre. I don't really know
about the scene then. I just know that a
friend of mine was a graduate student nerd
— now he's done really well in Silicon Val
ley as an engineer — but I can't judge
everyone by him."
Kilborn is also well-acquainted with bas
ketball head coach Mike Montgomery. Mont

gomery was formerly head coach of the Uni
versity of Montana, while Kilborn played
point guard at Montana State University.
"[When I think of Stanford, I think of]
Mike Montgomery," Kilborn said. "He actu
ally recruited me when he was head coach at
Montana, but then he didn't take me. We're
good friends now.
"He brought me a Dr. J. poster during the
recruiting process, because he knew Dr. J was
my favorite player, but it didn't work because
it wasn't wrapped around thousands of dollar
bills. Monty's an ethical guy."
Kilborn also commented on another ethi
cal guy whose dancing in last year's Los An
geles Lakers victory celebration has served as
a source of amusement and embarrassment
for Stanford students, former Cardinal for
ward Mark Madsen.
"The day after the Laker parade, we had
Maclsen on the show," Kilborn said. "We
showed clips of him at the parade, and he did
the dance again on the set and we immediate
ly had him taken away by security guards."
According to Kilborn, Stanford is a good
example of a university that embodies the
ideal of the student-athlete; Kilborn joked

The University's exact portrayal on the show will be a "game-time" decision.
