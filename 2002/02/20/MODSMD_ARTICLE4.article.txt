Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-
Washington, D.C.) spoke at the Law School last night
as part of a program co-sponsored by the Lawyer He
roes Speaker Series and the Black Law Students As
sociation.
Norton discussed her concern for human and de
mocratic rights, addressing the denial of voting rights
for her constituents in the District of Columbia as well
as her experiences as a member of Congress.
Norton said it was purely an "accident" that she
had run for Congress, especially considering that she
had "spent her life banging on the door of the estab
lishment, not becoming part of it."
Now in her sixth term, Norton acknowledged that she
hits experienced difficult moments in Congress, but has
never regretted representing her constituents.
Residents of Washington, D.C, have been denied the
light to vote in Congress for over 200 years. Norton spoke
about her work on the "No Taxation Without Represen
tation Act," which she hopes will guarantee voting rights to
her 600,000 constituents.
"Shame, shame on a free country that goes
around the world pointing its proverbial finger on
other countries for no democracy, while at the same
time denying democratic rights for its own citizens,"
she said.
Christen Smith, a doctoral candidate in cultural
and social anthropology and D.C. resident, asked
Norton how "friends and residents of [D.C.] could
work for the District of Columbia."
Norton emphasized that all Americans — in
cluding youth — could certainly influence Con
gress actions.
"Its everybody's Capitol," Norton said, adding
that she believes action must be taken to do some
thing about this "outrageous, undemocratic denial."
Norton spoke about the great movements in the past
that have lx*en led by students and working people, in
cluding the civil lights movement of the 19605.
She urged Stanford students to address their rep
resentatives in Congress to fight for the voting rights

of the citizens of D.C., and even brought up the idea
that the Stanford campus itself could write a letter to
the proper authorities to influence the issue.
Norton was introduced by Law School Dean Kathleen
Sullivan, who said that she is one of the most prominent
speakers that has been featured in the series.

Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) spoke
at the Law School last night, addressing issues of voting
rights for her constituents.
Founded in 1999 by Sullivan,
the series brings speakers to the
Law School to discuss legal, prac
tical, strategic and ethical issues.
"[Norton] is a great hero of civil
rights and human rights for all
people, and now the District of
Columbia is a place where people
are represented," Sullivan said.
Norton's talk was one of many
events that the Black Law Stu
dents Association has planned for
Black Liberation Month.
