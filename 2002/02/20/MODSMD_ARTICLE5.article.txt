# Hoover Tower bells to ring again
## After two years in the Netherlands, tower bells return home 
### VAUHINI VARA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Hoover lower bells, reinstalled in the tower
yesterday, will ring again this year — for the first
time since they left Stanford two years ago to be re
stored in the Netherlands.
The original carillon contained 35 bells; the ex
panded version has 48, enabling it to play an addi
tional octave of music.
"It was very nice for playing folk music, it had a
very cheerful sound, but it was not a refined musi
cal instrument," said Hoover Institution Archivist
Elena Danielson. "Now it will be."

For many Stanford students, the new Hoover lower
bells are as mysterious as the building they occupy —
die bells were removed in January 2000, before many
current undergraduates had arrived at Stanford.
"I didn't even know about it," said sophomore
Rosa Mateos.
"It kind of adds to the mystery of Hoover Tower
in general," sophomore Dana Mauriello said.
Mateos said the new bells will be an "interesting"
addition to campus, "just as long as they're not play
ing continuously and bothering people when
they're trying to study."
The bells will not be played during class hours,
Danielson said.
Funding for the renovation project came from a num
ber of different sources, including the President's Fund
and a number of private donors, who could "buy" a lx-11
with the inscription of their choice.
