# Hoover Tower bells to ring again
## After two years in the Netherlands, tower bells return home 
### VAUHINI VARA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Hoover lower bells, reinstalled in the tower
yesterday, will ring again this year — for the first
time since they left Stanford two years ago to be re
stored in the Netherlands.
The original carillon contained 35 bells; the ex
panded version has 48, enabling it to play an addi
tional octave of music.
"It was very nice for playing folk music, it had a
very cheerful sound, but it was not a refined musi
cal instrument," said Hoover Institution Archivist
Elena Danielson. "Now it will be."

For many Stanford students, the new Hoover lower
bells are as mysterious as the building they occupy —
die bells were removed in January 2000, before many
current undergraduates had arrived at Stanford.
"I didn't even know about it," said sophomore
Rosa Mateos.
"It kind of adds to the mystery of Hoover Tower
in general," sophomore Dana Mauriello said.
Mateos said the new bells will be an "interesting"
addition to campus, "just as long as they're not play
ing continuously and bothering people when
they're trying to study."
The bells will not be played during class hours,
Danielson said.
Funding for the renovation project came from a num
ber of different sources, including the President's Fund
and a number of private donors, who could "buy" a lx-11
with the inscription of their choice.
Tile new set of bells was man
ufactured at Royal fc'.ijsbouts, a
Dutch foundry, using a combi
nation of old-fashioned and
modern techniques.
After bells were cast from
packed sand molds, modern
computers were used to tune the
instrument. The final test of the
tone of the bell was done by ear.
"It was very exciting," said
Danielson, who traveled to
the Netherlands to observe
the process.
Mauriello and Mateos, who
have not heard the Hoover Tower
bells, wondered how they differ
from the bells in the clock tower.
"The clock tower bells are
technically chimes, while the
Hoover Tower bells make up a
carillon," Danielson explained.
"Chimes have a smaller
number of bells, while caril
lons have a larger number of
bells — enough to play
tunes," she added.
The Hoover Tower bells will
be played by music professor and

carillonneur Tim Zerlang.
Although the date of the first
concert is yet to be determined,
Danielson expects the bells to be

in working condition by Com
mencement.
Danielson has been at the Uni
versity long enough to remember

the carillon concerts that used to
take place every afternoon.
"It's one of the treasures of the
universities," she said.

Donations by private donors, who could choose the inscription on "their" bell, helped fund the restoration of the 48-
