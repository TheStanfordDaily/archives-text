# Grant funds Asian studies abroad
## Freeman money to support East Asian Studies 
### ELISE CYRUS 
Last month the Center for
East Asian Studies received a
Freeman Grant of almost $2 mil
lion. The grant will allow the
center to provide new opportu
nities to experience Asia outside
of the classroom beginning this
summer.
The four programs that will
be started with the funds will

greatly expand the resources
available to the center to support
undergraduate students, ac
cording to officials at the center.
In the past, the center could
send only a limited number of
undergraduates for language
study abroad, as most of the
available funds were earmarked
for graduate students.
The Freeman Grant is desig
nated fora summer internship
program, fellowships for lan
guage study and overseas sum
mer seminars — all for under
graduates. A fourth program
will bring distinguished individ
uals who have worked in China,

Japan or Korea to teach short
term courses at Stanford.
According to center Director
Jean Oi, the grant will be used to
"tie classroom learning about
Asia with real world experience
in Asia."
One way the overseas semi
nars will achieve this is through
class field trips.
"For my seminar, for exam
ple, I plan to take students to the
countryside to actually observe
village elections," Oi said.
Oi hopes the 17 to 23 sum
mer internships will allow stu
dents to understand the context
of countries in which organiza
tions must operate. Students will
be able to work almost anywhere,
including non-profit organiza
tions, government offices and the
media.
Students have shown a strong
interest in these programs.
Sophomore Jean Chow learned
of the center when she decided to

major in Chinese.
"I think the [center] is a helpful
resource," Chow said. "I recently
applied for the [center's] lan
guage study fellowship for this
summer."
While the center gives prefer
ence to students with majors and
minors that fall within its areas of
study, these new opportunities
are open to all students who have
the necessary language and area
studies preparation. The center
holds weekly seminars on China,
Japan and Korea that are open to
the public.
