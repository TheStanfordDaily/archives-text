# Peruvian writer Llosa speaks
## Prominent author discusses meaning of being a novelist 
### ERIKKA INNES STAFF WRITER 
Renowned Peruvian writer
Mario Vargas Llosa gave a speech
about being a novelist at Clubber
ley Auditorium last night.
Delivered in the form of two
letters answering the questions of
a young man who wants to be a
writer, Llosa's talk covered the
topic of what it means to be a
novelist and how a novelist gen
erates ideas.
The first letter, entitled "The
Parable of the Tapeworm" de
scribed how one becomes a novel
ist. Llosa said the seeds of a novel
ist begin in the teenage years,
when one begins dreaming up sto
ries about other worlds.
The exercise of the imagina
tion "is a sign of literary voca
tion," he said. "Developing the
literary vocation beyond the cre
ation of personal fantasies re
quires a conscious decision.
"You reach a point where you
must decide whether you will
amuse yourself with fictions or set
them down in writing."
Llosa shared a story about a
friend of his who had a tapeworm
living inside of him. The friend
began to feel that everything he ate
was for the tapeworm rather than
for himself.
"The lot of the writer is like my

friend with the tapeworm," Llosa
explained. " The literary vocation
of a writer feeds off the life of a
writer the way a tapeworm feeds
off the body." The anecdote con
cluded Llosa's first letter.
The second letter discussed how
a novelist generates ideas. "All sto
ries are rooted in the lives of those
who write them," Llosa stated. He
said rebellion and dissatisfaction
with ihe surrounding world was
the chief reason for the creation of
a literary work. "Why would any
one satisfied with reality dedicate
so much time to an insubstantial
fictional reality?" he asked.
Llosa concluded his talk with-

out pinning down exactly how a
novelist generates ideas. "A novel
is mysterious, complex, and a little
bit irrational," he explained.
The talk was part of the lan
Watt lecture series, a program
begun last year by the Center for
the Study of the Novel. When
asked what he thought of the talk,
Center Director Franco Moretti
said "It couldn't have been better."
He was impressed with the
turnout of fans who listened in
tently while Llosa spoke for two
hours. "This is what a university
should be like," Moretti said.

Audience member Haydee Ro

" He's one of the living authors I've
wanted to see since 1 was a kid,"
she said. "This lecture is a dream
come true."
Llosa has written a tremendous
number of works, which have
earned him many awards. He has

been named a member of the Peru
vian Academy of language and the
Royal Spanish Academy. From
1976 to 1979 he was elected presi
dent of International P.E.N., a
world-wide association of writers
devoted to assisting in the relief of
persecuted writers and their fami
lies. His work has been translated
into at least 16 languages and his
book-length works include "The
Green House," "Aunt Julia and the
Scriptwriter," "Making Waves" and
"The Perpetual Orgy."
