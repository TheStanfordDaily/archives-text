# Sunstein: Web deters debate

### ABIGAIL PHILLIPS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University of Chicago Law Prof. Cass Sunstein's
latest book titled, "Republic.Com," came out this
month, describing a society in which everything is

perfectly tailored to the individual.
His goal was to show how the In
ternet fragments debate, encouraging
people to gather around similar ideas
and opinions. For example, when on
line discussion groups are formed
around a particular political outlook,
members get little exposure to differ
ing viewpoints and are less likely to re
form diehard opinions.
According to Sunstein, this is erod
ing the underpinnings of American re
publicanism. Ideally, a "deliberative"

democracy guarantees that government policies will be
a result of reflection and debate. This requires expos
ing people to information and viewpoints that they
would not find on their own, and an opportunity to ex
press ideas in a diverse forum.
But does the Internet really discourage a free ex
change of ideas? Some would argue that it offers a
good alternative to the traditional public forum,
such as the commons or town meeting, that many
agree has disappeared in today's world. The Inter
net transposes the social network from real space to

cyberspace, so that it may be one of the best means
available to establish social bonds and find vehicles
for discussion.
However, Sunstein is concerned that even if peo
ple exchange ideas on the Internet, they limit discus
sion to small and insular groups of like-minded peo-

pie. l lie internet also siphons people
into insular groups, with little transfer
of information between them. The
range of an individual's knowledge
consequently narrows and becomes
less lit for political debate.
But while some Web sites cater
exclusively to a certain set of opin
ions, many do not. In fact, Sunstein
collaborated with his publisher to
create a digital forum for posting
thoughts about "Republic.com."
Sunstein micrht airree. then, that it

is better to find community on the Internet than
not at all.
The Internet may actually promote more politi
cal debate than it deters. The detriment might not
be social fragmentation but information consolida
tion. This would result from people getting all their
information from a single source because it's easier
than reading through multiple sources. The
prospect of a single pipeline is just as threatening as
the balkanization of information, according to
many Internet scholars.
