REQA AL-GHARBIYA, Egypt
(AP) — Fire whipped by strong
winds raced through a train
packed with Egyptians headed
home fora Muslim holiday yester
day, creating an inferno that
forced desperate passengers to
lea}) from the speeding cars. At
least 370 people died in Egypt's
worst rail disaster.
Scores of people were trapped
inside, some by window grills, as
the burning train barreled along
the tracks. The engineer drove on
for 2 1/2 miles before learning of
the fire, and even after he brought
the train to a halt, the fire went on
for hours, destroying seven of the
train's 11 cars.
The cause of the fire was not
known. Suspicion fell on gas con
tainers that passengers often bring
with them to cook food or make
tea on the long journey.
Ahmed Adil, the Health Min
istry undersecretary, put the death
toll at 370. Police said 65 people
were being treated for injuries.
That made it the deadliest train

accident ever in Egypt and one of
the worst in the world. In 1989,
about 000 people were killed
when a gas pipeline explosion
blew apart two trains stopped in
Russia's Ural Mountains.
The train was headed south
from the capital, Cairo, on a trip
that took it along the edge of the
Nile Valley. Survivors said the
train was so full that they were sit
ting on the floor. Ahmed al-
Sherif, director of the state
owned Egyptian Railway Author
ity, said the train was overcrowd
ed, putting the number aboard at
about 1,200.
Al-Sherif said the train left
Cairo on its 300-mile journey to
Luxor about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday,
and the fire broke out about 90
minutes later. The train traveled
in flames for 2 1/2 miles before
stopping at Reqa al-Gharbiya, a
village 60 miles south of Cairo. Al
Sherif said it was not clear why the
emergency brakes were not ap
plied immediately.
Electricity in the train went out

in the moments after tire, leaving
confused and frightened passen
gers in darkness, witnesses said.
The cars had metal frames with
wooden seats, and witnesses saw
passengers, some on fire, running
from car to car.
The fire appeared to have bro
ken out in the fourth car, which
was the most badly burned. Inves
tigators were looking into gas
cylinders and small stoves passen
gers often bring, despite regula
tions forbidding it. People were
likely smoking on board as well.
Train driver Mansour Youssef
el-Qams, 46, said when he saw the
flames, he stopped the train and
ordered his crew to separate the
burning cars from the rest of the
train, the Middle East News
Agency said.
An hour later, the train contin
ued on its way, leaving the burned
cars behind and going on to Minya,
75 miles south, the driver said, ac
cording to Egypt's Al-Goumhouria
newspaper. It was not immediately
clear why he resumed the journey.
