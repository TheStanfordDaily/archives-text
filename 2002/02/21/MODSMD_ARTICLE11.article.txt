### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Geoffrey Moore, bestselling
author and venture partner at
Mohr, Davidow Ventures spoke
on Feb. 13 at the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders Seminar.
Moore was invited by BASES and
the Stanford Technology Ven
tures Program. He offered entre
preneurial advice to students and
described the developments of
his career.
The key to a successful compa
ny is competitive advantage, ac
cording to Moore. This can come
in many forms, but the idea itself is
key, he said.
"We don't know [where the
next big market is] and we don't
try to predict," Moore said. "We
try to be alert, and actually the
entrepreneurs teach ns where
things are going. Whether
you're a good entrepreneur or
a bad entrepreneur, with a
good plan or a bad plan, you've
got an idea. And just by coming
and talking to us about what
you're thinking about, we begin
to respond."
"Starting out, the most impor
tant things we look for at Mohr,
Davidow is a genuine, deep, tech
nology-based product advantage
that can be applied to what even
tually can become a very large
market," Moore said.
With the flood of start-ups
now fading from memory as an
anomaly of history, venture capi

tal has returned to the more tra
ditional model.
Though not expecting a Mi
crosoft with every investment,each
idea must contain the possibility of
a huge success in order to be an at
tractive investment fora venture
capital tii ni, according Moore.
In addition to his work in
venture capital, Moore is a four
time bestselling author. His
books include 1991 's "Crossing
the Chasm" and 1995's "Inside
the Tornado."
"'Crossing the Chasm' was
about how you break into the mar
ket with a new technology," Moore
said. '"Inside the Tornado' was
about what you do once you're in
the middle of one of these markets
that's taken off. The point of this
was that the strategy changes pret
ty dramatically."
"From the very outset of
"Crossing the Chasm," I worked
with a lot of venture capital
backed companies, and that led
to venture capital firms inviting
me in to do what they called
'CEO days,' when they gather
their portfolio together," Moore
said. "Mohr, Davidow invited me
to become a venture partner in
their firm."
