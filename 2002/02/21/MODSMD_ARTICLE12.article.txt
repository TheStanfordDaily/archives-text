### 
JERUSALEM (AP) —After losing 13 soldiers in
the past week, Israel is changing its militaiy tactics
and will focus on small-scale actions to deal with what
it views as a guerrilla war, a top Israeli official said
yesterday — a day during wliich air strikes and
raids killed 18 Palestinians.
'Ilie past week has been one of the bloodiest
since Israeli-Palestinian fighting began in Septem
ber 2000. Seventeen Israelis and 47 Palestinians
were killed.
The fighting raged yesterday, with Israeli ttoops
firing missiles, tank shells and machine guns at
Palestinian Authority positions in reprisals fora
Palestinian ambush that killed six Israeli soldiers. In
a later clash, Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinian
militants who were about to fire rockets at Israel, ac
cording to media reports and Palestinian officials.
Warplanes pounded Palestinian targets into

the night — even as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said Israel would focus
on "small-scale counter-guerrilla, counter-terror
ist operations."
The ambush Tuesday night at an Israeli military
checkpoint near die village of Ein Arik, west of Ra
in; illah, sparked a debate on the wisdom of main
taining the scores of military roadblocks throughout
the West Bank and Gaza.
The Palestinians might Ik- changing their tac
tics as well. Several Palestinians close to the mili
tant groups said the checkpoint assault reflected a
new focus: targeting Israel's occupation in the
West Bank and Gaza its opposed to attacks within
Israel itself.
Ilie Palestinians said on condition of anonymity
that the aim is to focus attention on the lands Pales
tinians claim fora state and rally world support .

Both sides buried their dead yesterday. Thou
sands of angry Palestinians marched behind
coffins throughout the Palestinian areas, pledging
revenge, while weeping Israelis buried their sol
diers amid calls for new, harsher measures to stop
the violence.
After a meeting of top ministers yesterday,
Sharon announced a "different course of action."
He gave no details, but his spokesman Gissin said Is
rael would reduce the number of large operations
and in favor of smaller-scale actions "with the pur
pose of really trying to tip the terrorists off-balance."
Gissin said that would include a continuation of
die targeted killings of militants suspected of in
volvement in terrorism against Israelis, but diat Is
rael would not target Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat — even though it blames him for failing to
stop the violence.
