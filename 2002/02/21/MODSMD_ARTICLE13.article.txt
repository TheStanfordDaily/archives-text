## The 						Stanford Daily Student input essential in University decisions 
### 
Published Since 1891

The ASSU and concerned students
sent the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, Committee on Under
graduate Studies and the Commit
tee on Graduate Studies a clear message on
Tuesday: student voice is integral to Stan
ford's continued success as a top university.
We commend the ASSU resolution con
cerning the termination of the Latin Ameri
can Studies program. We support the
ASSU's move in calling for increased student
input in these types of decisions.
The ASSU used the resolution to draw at
tention to the poor communication by the
people who eliminated the bachelor's and
master's degree-granting status of Latin
American Studies without warning the pro
gram's current students and those who had
yet to apply.
Furthermore, the resolution strongly urged

the administration to work with affected LAS
students to allow them to voice their concerns
about the program's termination.
The third part of this resolution appropriate
ly outlined the need for future student contri
bution to the administrative decision-making
processes in comparable situations — especially
in the case of possible termination or radical
changes to academic departments or interdisci
plinary programs. Moreover, the ASSU offered
both the Advocacy Committee and the Nomina
tions Commission to work with to develop better
lines of communication.
Much of the damage has already been
done in this case. Students who were consid
ering majoring in Latin American Studies,
but had yet to declare, cannot. The two de
gree programs will not exist next year. Such
is current University procedure with any de
gree program that suddenly disappears.

We believe that students need to be given
advance notice when program reviews begin,
and a when a program may not be renewed,
this fact should be made public. The admin
istration must do more than make this infor
mation public in the Faculty Senate meeting
notes, posted online. These processes must
be more public than the back section of the
Stanford Report. We encourage the adminis
tration to seek alternatives that truly make
students and the greater Stanford communi
ty aware of changes in its structure.
Some possible solutions include holding stu
dent-friendly forums to discuss such matters or
including the information as part of the Stan
ford Bulletin. Even placing an asterisk or note
in the Time Schedule next to departments and
programs that are under review would drasti
cally help to increase transparency.
This sort of indication is especially impor-

tant when an interdisciplinary program is on
probation. An indication in the Time Schedule
or Bulletin would alert students to the fact that
serious improvement was necessary in that
program, and that it might be terminated if
such progress did not occur.
Not only will these moves give students ad
vance warning about any risk of termination,
but they will also allow students to become
more actively involved in the improvement of
faltering programs before they enter a state of
crisis.
The administration must take a more ac
tive role in integrating student voice into the
decision-making process of program re
newals. Including a few students is a start but
many students — especially those directly af
fected by the prospective change — should
have their voices heard when it comes to such
important matters.
