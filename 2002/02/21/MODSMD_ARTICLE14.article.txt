## Drug prohibition ineffective, illegal status promotes crime 
### 
During this year's epic Super Bowl,
ajarring advertisement appeared
on the screen. It wasn't the E-
Trade monkey, but a succes
sion of innocent faces in front of a stark
black screen, relaying a series of simple,
scary messages:

"I helped murder fam
ilies in Colombia."
"I helped kidnap
people's dads."
"I helped to kill po
licemen."
"I helped a bomber get
a fake passport."
"I helped blow up
buildings."

Then, in large white letters, "Drug
Money Supports Terror. If You Buy
Drugs You Might Too."
As effective as it was, the commercial,
produced and paid for by the White
House Office of National Drug Control
Policy, was seriously misleading. The
government, not the user, is the reason
that drug money is seeping into the
pockets of terrorists.
Whatever good intentions may lie be
hind laws that keep most drugs illegal,
the prohibition of drugs has had disas
trous consequences. One of the most ru
inous is that it has kept the drug industry
underground, ensuring that only the
worst members of society can profit from
the production, transportation and sell
ing of narcotics.
While there isn't a widespread social
movement to legalize drugs, arguing for
the repeal of drug laws isn't a radical no
tion. Two weeks ago someone beat me to
the punch and sent in an intelligent let
ter to the editor about this same com
mercial. And, last summer, no less than
The Economist, the highly regarded
conservative British newsmagazine,
published a 16-page, American-focused
survey called "The case for legalising
drugs" (love that British spelling).
It should be required reading for all
Americans, let alone all policymakers.
The Economist doesn't argue merely
for the legalization of marijuana, as does
New Mexico's Republican Governor
Gary Johnson.
Instead, it argues fora gradual pro
gram that ultimately places all illicit
drugs on par with tobacco and alcohol,
with corresponding restrictions on ac
cess and governmental regulations con
cerning quality control and purity.
There is a myriad of reasons to legalize
drugs. But, in light of the commercial,
one major reason should be addressed.
As The Economist presciently points

out, "Prohibition of drugs hands over to
criminals and rogue states a vast amount
of revenue — say $80 billion to 100 bil
lion a year, based on the gap between
rich-world import prices and retail
prices — that governments could other
wise tax away and spend for the common
good."
For example, in Colombia, the un
popular FARC rebels earn most of the
money they need to fight their brutal in
surgency by taxing the production and
transport of illegal coca plants. But they
wouldn't get nearly as much money, and
therefore wouldn't be able to buy nearly
as effective weapons, if the drug industry
lost most of its profitability.
Mark Kleiman, a drug-policy expert
at UCLA, estimates that the street price
of cocaine would be about 1/20 of its cur
rent amount after legalization. Consid
ering that the White House estimated
the street price of a pure gram of cocaine
was around $225 in 2000, using
Kleiman's figures, that'd be about
$1 1.25 per pure gram, post-legalization.
When you factor in the street dealer,
the mid-level distributor, the wholesale
distributor, the transportation and the
production, that doesn't leave a whole
lot of profit to fund a war.
Certainly, when you lower the price it
also makes it easier for people to buy and
use drugs. Legalization will bring about
more users, especially in the middle class.
But repeated studies have shown that
treatment costs less than imprisonment,
and with fewer social consequences.
One example of the fallout from drug
prohibition is this stark fact: according to
reports compiled by The Sentencing Pro
ject, African-Americans make up 13 per
cent of monthly drug users, 34 percent of
people arrested for possession of illegal
narcotics, 55 percent of those convicted and
74 percent of those sentenced to prison.
That should make you angry. It
should also make you consider the other
policy options at America's disposal.
The intent of the commercial was
great. Drug addiction ruins lives and is
an enormous social blot on our country.
Anything that can cut into drug use is
fantastic. But drug use will never disap
pear; it isn't a modern invention.
So, instead of investing money vilifying
drug users with post-Sept. 11 shock value,
the government should be spending the
$3.5 million it cost to buy the Super Bowl
air time on developing a more realistic
and more effective drug policy.

was around $225 in 2000, using
Kleiman's figures, that'd be about
$1 1.25 per pure gram, post-legalization.
When you factor in the street dealer,
the mid-level distributor, the wholesale
distributor, the transportation and the
production, that doesn't leave a whole
lot of profit to fund a war.
Certainly, when you lower the price it
also makes it easier for people to buy and
use drugs. Legalization will bring about
more users, especially in the middle class.
But repeated studies have shown that
treatment costs less than imprisonment,
and with fewer social consequences.
One example of the fallout from drug
prohibition is this stark fact: according to
reports compiled by The Sentencing Pro
ject, African-Americans make up 13 per
cent of monthly drug users, 34 percent of
people arrested for possession of illegal
narcotics, 55 percent of those convicted and
74 percent of those sentenced to prison.
That should make you angry. It
should also make you consider the other
policy options at America's disposal.
The intent of the commercial was
great. Drug addiction ruins lives and is
an enormous social blot on our country.
Anything that can cut into drug use is
fantastic. But drug use will never disap
pear; it isn't a modern invention.
So, instead of investing money vilifying
drug users with post-Sept. 11 shock value,
the government should be spending the
$3.5 million it cost to buy the Super Bowl
air time on developing a more realistic
and more effective drug policy.

During this year's epic Super Bowl,
ajarring advertisement appeared
on the screen. It wasn't the E-
Trade monkey, but a succes
sion of innocent faces in front of a stark
black screen, relaying a series of simple,
scary messages:

"I helped murder fam
ilies in Colombia."
"I helped kidnap
people's dads."
"I helped to kill po
licemen."
"I helped a bomber get
a fake passport."
"I helped blow up
buildings."

Then, in large white letters, "Drug
Money Supports Terror. If You Buy
Drugs You Might Too."
As effective as it was, the commercial,
produced and paid for by the White
House Office of National Drug Control
Policy, was seriously misleading. The
government, not the user, is the reason
that drug money is seeping into the
pockets of terrorists.
Whatever good intentions may lie be
hind laws that keep most drugs illegal,
the prohibition of drugs has had disas
trous consequences. One of the most ru
inous is that it has kept the drug industry
underground, ensuring that only the
worst members of society can profit from
the production, transportation and sell
ing of narcotics.
While there isn't a widespread social
movement to legalize drugs, arguing for
the repeal of drug laws isn't a radical no
tion. Two weeks ago someone beat me to
the punch and sent in an intelligent let
ter to the editor about this same com
mercial. And, last summer, no less than
The Economist, the highly regarded
conservative British newsmagazine,
published a 16-page, American-focused
survey called "The case for legalising
drugs" (love that British spelling).
It should be required reading for all
Americans, let alone all policymakers.
The Economist doesn't argue merely
for the legalization of marijuana, as does
New Mexico's Republican Governor
Gary Johnson.
Instead, it argues fora gradual pro
gram that ultimately places all illicit
drugs on par with tobacco and alcohol,
with corresponding restrictions on ac
cess and governmental regulations con
cerning quality control and purity.
There is a myriad of reasons to legalize
drugs. But, in light of the commercial,
one major reason should be addressed.
As The Economist presciently points

out, "Prohibition of drugs hands over to
criminals and rogue states a vast amount
of revenue — say $80 billion to 100 bil
lion a year, based on the gap between
rich-world import prices and retail
prices — that governments could other
wise tax away and spend for the common
good."
For example, in Colombia, the un
popular FARC rebels earn most of the
money they need to fight their brutal in
surgency by taxing the production and
transport of illegal coca plants. But they
wouldn't get nearly as much money, and
therefore wouldn't be able to buy nearly
as effective weapons, if the drug industry
lost most of its profitability.
Mark Kleiman, a drug-policy expert
at UCLA, estimates that the street price
of cocaine would be about 1/20 of its cur
rent amount after legalization. Consid
ering that the White House estimated
the street price of a pure gram of cocaine
was around $225 in 2000, using
Kleiman's figures, that'd be about
$1 1.25 per pure gram, post-legalization.
