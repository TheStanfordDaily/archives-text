SLAC should heed its own advice
Like every other hypocrite at this
school, I read The Daily almost every day
and complain ceaselessly about some ar
ticle yet never express those complaints
in print. I mention this only to point out
that when one goes so far as to write a let
ter to the editor, he must feel he's really
got something to say.
Chris Van Dyke's letter to the editor
yesterday charges The Daily with continu
al misrepresentation and fabrication of the
facts regarding its coverage of the Coali
tion for Labor Justice in the past week.
Let's consider the instances he mentions.
Having not been at the ASSU meeting
referenced, I can only concede Van
Dyke's point that The Daily made up the
claim that coalition members loudly exit
ed last week's meeting. Given that Van
Dyke points out that ASSU Senator Alex
Shvartsman had to "gain control" of the
affair, I'm not sure what Van Dyke con
siders to be the significance of this fact. If
he means to suggest that it misrepresents
the coalition's behavior, fine, but his own
admission about the disordei liness of the
whole affair seems to contradict that
claim. But, I digress.
Van Dyke next criticizes this editorial
remark: "Immediately approximately
45 black-clad students jumped to their
feet and began firing demands at Hen
nessy, complete with placards iterating
their position."
He argues that the word "jump," used
in this context, unfairly colors the coali
tion's actions. I'd first ask him for his sug
gestion as to a better word, given that the
word was used in an editorial article and
not a regular news piece. Hut additional

ly, I wonder how he thinks The Daily —
and the administration — should have
perceived the "45 black clad students."
Presumably the students wore black to
show solidarity in support of the cause. I
don't mean to be facetious, but perhaps
the coalition could have presented itself
as an army of 45 baby-blue warriors clad
in unity. I just think the black might be a
little off-putting.
Van I)yke corrects that the coalition
did not "fire demands" but that three
spokespeople stood along with the group
to firmly state the coalition's case.
He also notes that The Daily earlier
depicted the events as if coalition mem
bers "strung [questions] together as if
they were spoken in a back-and-forth ar
gument." Does Van Dyke think that the
Daily's reporting conjured up visions of a
wild auction, coalition members firing off
jabs like a furious bidding war? I don't
mean to be presumptuous, but Mr. Van
Dyke, 1 think 1 speak on behalf of a lot of
people when 1 say, "nobody really got
that impression."
All of these remarks, quibbles that led
Van Dyke to go so far out of his way to
write a letter to The Daily, seem nitpicky
to me — a posturing Van Dyke says he
wishes to avoid. For some reason, 1 feel
like Van Dyke knows he might be viewed
in this light. If nothing else, I think his let
ter makes him appear defensive.
I see no reason why an activist organi
zation should have to defend its activism;
I would think it would be better served by
devoting its defensive efforts to the cause.
I am a fairly liberal person, although
not reflexively so. I don't agree with
every cause I hear coalition or other left
ist groups championing, but I applaud

their general attitude to raise concern on
behalf of those continually marginalized
by society. That said, I think Van Dyke
and the coalition should heed their own
advice that the administration and the
Daily be objective in their portrayal of
protesters or whistle blowers.
SLAC has done a disservice to its future
ambitions to work with the University
and, as a consequence, to the poorest
members of the community on whose be
half it wishes to speak. SLAC would bene
fit from a little more self-awareness about
the manner in which it presents itself and
the need to be more diplomatic in its ap
proach to the University administration.
Fight the good fight, but be selective in
deciding when to put on the gloves.

"Axis of Evil" is make-believe
In response to Prof.-Emeritus Robert
Cohn's letter of Feb. 20, it deserves to be
pointed out that his letter itself glosses
over a number of fairly large differences
between President Bush's "axis of evil"
and the world of Roosevelt, Churchill
and Hitler.
First, as should be fairly obvious, the at
tack on Pearl Harbor was a military strike
against the United States. As Colin states,
"Iran's mullahs have often declared their
eagerness to destroy us and the West gen
erally and are actively seeking the means,
especially nuclear, to do so."
Although jingoistic rhetoric has be
come very popular recently, it seems the
domain of the absurd to equate a military
attack, signaling the beginning of a
major war, with populist rhetoric that is
not backed up by any military action. In
fact, Iran was even cooperating to a de
gree with the war on terrorism until
President George W. Bush, in one of the
worst decisions of his short presidency,
decided to lump Iran in with North
Korea and Iraq, two countries with
which it has virtually nothing in com
mon, including military alliances.
Undoubtedly Cohn would respond by
noting that Iran, and indeed Iraq and

North Korea, are trying to develop
weapons of mass destruction. As a nation
al security matter, clearly the fewer peo
ple in possession of these weapons, the
better. However, as a moral matter, it is
difficult to fault Europeans for not want
ing to pursue win with these nations.
After all, who first developed the
weapons that we are trying to prevent the
Iranians and North Koreans from get
ting? The United States, because it was
looking after its own security.
As for the threat that is posed to na
tional security now, if the Soviet Union
did not strike first against the United
States during all those years when it en
joyed close to missile parity with the U.S.,
it hardly seems likely that these nations
would attack the U.S now. This is espe
cially improbable given their small capa
bilities relative to the guaranteed Ameri

can response, especially after the strong
example set by the U.S. in Afghanistan.
Thus, it seems a bit harsh to call our Eu
ropean allies "fainthearted." It is perhaps
more apt to say that, having experienced
more than their share of war and terror
ism in the 20th Century, they have a better
understanding of what is involved when a
vastly stronger nation invades and de
stroys the infrastructure of a country and
the lives of millions of people.
Having lived in between the United
States and the Soviet Union during the
Cold War, they are not eager to return to
a struggle of civilizations that could be eas
ily avoided by separating aggressive lan
guage from aggressive action on the part
of the Iranians, Iraqis and North Koreans.

"Axis of Evil" is make-believe
In response to Prof.-Emeritus Robert
Cohn's letter of Feb. 20, it deserves to be
pointed out that his letter itself glosses
over a number of fairly large differences
between President Bush's "axis of evil"
and the world of Roosevelt, Churchill
and Hitler.
First, as should be fairly obvious, the at
tack on Pearl Harbor was a military strike
against the United States. As Colin states,
"Iran's mullahs have often declared their
eagerness to destroy us and the West gen
erally and are actively seeking the means,
especially nuclear, to do so."
Although jingoistic rhetoric has be
come very popular recently, it seems the
domain of the absurd to equate a military
attack, signaling the beginning of a
major war, with populist rhetoric that is
not backed up by any military action. In
fact, Iran was even cooperating to a de
gree with the war on terrorism until
President George W. Bush, in one of the
worst decisions of his short presidency,
decided to lump Iran in with North
Korea and Iraq, two countries with
which it has virtually nothing in com
mon, including military alliances.
Undoubtedly Cohn would respond by
noting that Iran, and indeed Iraq and

North Korea, are trying to develop
weapons of mass destruction. As a nation
al security matter, clearly the fewer peo
ple in possession of these weapons, the
better. However, as a moral matter, it is
difficult to fault Europeans for not want
ing to pursue win with these nations.
After all, who first developed the
weapons that we are trying to prevent the
Iranians and North Koreans from get
ting? The United States, because it was
looking after its own security.
As for the threat that is posed to na
tional security now, if the Soviet Union
did not strike first against the United
States during all those years when it en
joyed close to missile parity with the U.S.,
it hardly seems likely that these nations
would attack the U.S now. This is espe
cially improbable given their small capa
bilities relative to the guaranteed Ameri

can response, especially after the strong
example set by the U.S. in Afghanistan.
Thus, it seems a bit harsh to call our Eu
ropean allies "fainthearted." It is perhaps
more apt to say that, having experienced
more than their share of war and terror
ism in the 20th Century, they have a better
understanding of what is involved when a
vastly stronger nation invades and de
stroys the infrastructure of a country and
the lives of millions of people.
Having lived in between the United
States and the Soviet Union during the
Cold War, they are not eager to return to
a struggle of civilizations that could be eas
ily avoided by separating aggressive lan
guage from aggressive action on the part
of the Iranians, Iraqis and North Koreans.

SLAC should heed its own advice
Like every other hypocrite at this
school, I read The Daily almost every day
and complain ceaselessly about some ar
ticle yet never express those complaints
in print. I mention this only to point out
that when one goes so far as to write a let
ter to the editor, he must feel he's really
got something to say.
Chris Van Dyke's letter to the editor
yesterday charges The Daily with continu
al misrepresentation and fabrication of the
facts regarding its coverage of the Coali
tion for Labor Justice in the past week.
Let's consider the instances he mentions.
Having not been at the ASSU meeting
referenced, I can only concede Van
Dyke's point that The Daily made up the
claim that coalition members loudly exit
ed last week's meeting. Given that Van
Dyke points out that ASSU Senator Alex
Shvartsman had to "gain control" of the
affair, I'm not sure what Van Dyke con
siders to be the significance of this fact. If
he means to suggest that it misrepresents
the coalition's behavior, fine, but his own
admission about the disordei liness of the
whole affair seems to contradict that
claim. But, I digress.
Van Dyke next criticizes this editorial
remark: "Immediately approximately
45 black-clad students jumped to their
feet and began firing demands at Hen
nessy, complete with placards iterating
their position."
He argues that the word "jump," used
in this context, unfairly colors the coali
tion's actions. I'd first ask him for his sug
gestion as to a better word, given that the
word was used in an editorial article and
not a regular news piece. Hut additional

ly, I wonder how he thinks The Daily —
and the administration — should have
perceived the "45 black clad students."
Presumably the students wore black to
show solidarity in support of the cause. I
don't mean to be facetious, but perhaps
the coalition could have presented itself
as an army of 45 baby-blue warriors clad
in unity. I just think the black might be a
little off-putting.
Van I)yke corrects that the coalition
did not "fire demands" but that three
spokespeople stood along with the group
to firmly state the coalition's case.
He also notes that The Daily earlier
depicted the events as if coalition mem
bers "strung [questions] together as if
they were spoken in a back-and-forth ar
gument." Does Van Dyke think that the
Daily's reporting conjured up visions of a
wild auction, coalition members firing off
jabs like a furious bidding war? I don't
mean to be presumptuous, but Mr. Van
Dyke, 1 think 1 speak on behalf of a lot of
people when 1 say, "nobody really got
that impression."
All of these remarks, quibbles that led
Van Dyke to go so far out of his way to
write a letter to The Daily, seem nitpicky
to me — a posturing Van Dyke says he
wishes to avoid. For some reason, 1 feel
like Van Dyke knows he might be viewed
in this light. If nothing else, I think his let
ter makes him appear defensive.
I see no reason why an activist organi
zation should have to defend its activism;
I would think it would be better served by
devoting its defensive efforts to the cause.
I am a fairly liberal person, although
not reflexively so. I don't agree with
every cause I hear coalition or other left
ist groups championing, but I applaud

their general attitude to raise concern on
behalf of those continually marginalized
by society. That said, I think Van Dyke
and the coalition should heed their own
advice that the administration and the
Daily be objective in their portrayal of
protesters or whistle blowers.
SLAC has done a disservice to its future
ambitions to work with the University
