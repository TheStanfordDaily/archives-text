### 
E(litor's Note: This resolution was adopted
by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate on Tues
day. The bill was authored by Senators Xirne
na Martinez, Sonrisa Lucero, hivina Tien
and Nominations Commission Chairperson
Henry Towsner, and was sponsored by the
Student Advocacy Committee.
\V hereas the Deans of Humanities and
Sciences, the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies, and the Committee on Gradu
ate Studies recently decided to end Latin
American Studies' degree-granting status,
Whereas the Latin American B.A. and
M.A. programs were discontinued fora
number of reasons, among them that the
LAS program had already been on pro
bation since 1998, that there was a lack of
faculty support for the program, that the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences was
unable to find a director prior to the de

cision and that the Committee on Cur
riculum considered the program insuffi
ciently rigorous,
Whereas students directly affected by
this decision were only notified about the
decision after it was made and were not
give the opportunity to voice their con
cerns against the termination of the Latin
American B.A. and M.A. programs at the
meetings where the matter was discussed,
Whereas students planning to declare a
major in lAS were not informed and
given adequate time to declare before the
B.A. program was discontinued,
Whereas students did not immediate
ly receive an official statement from the
dean's office notifying them of the deci
sion regarding the Latin American B.A.
and M.A. programs,
Whereas students fear that this decision
will have a detrimental impact on the in

tellectual and cultural vitality on campus,
Whereas the University has the respon
sibility to provide answers to the students
personally impacted by this decision as
well as to the entire student population,
Whereas it is appropriate for important
decisions such as this to be made with di
rect input from the affected students, pro
viding them with prior notification about
the issue being discussed,
Whereas although the termination of a
degree-granting program is unusual, that
makes it all the more important that there
be a clear procedure in place to ensure
that nothing is overlooked,
Whereas while it is desirable for the
groups making such a decision to receive
objective critiques from participating stu
dents, it is also desirable for the committee
to hear, from those students, what the im
pact of its decision will be,

Whereas we applaud the Deans of Hu
manities and Sciences, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies and the Commit
tee on Graduate Studies for their efforts to
address and respond to our concerns,
Whereas L\S students have asked for
t he support of many groups, including the
Undergraduate Senate.
Whereas the Undergraduate Senate
has a duty, given the growing student con
cern over the lack of administrative ac
countability and transparency, to bring
such matters before the administration,
Therefore be it resolved that the Un
dergraduate Senate is disappointed with
the lack of communication between the
groups which made this decision and the
affected students before, during and after
the decision was made.
Therefore be it further resolved that the
Undergraduate Senate will send a letter to

the lAS Program Director, the Deans of
Humanities and Sciences and the mem
bers of the Faculty Senate Committees on
Undergraduate and Graduate Studies
urging the administration to work closely
with affected LAS students in future deci
sions regarding the lAS programs and
permit affected students to voice their con
cerns to the decision making bodies.
Therefore be it further resolved that
the Advocacy Committee of the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate and the Nomina
tions Committee shall work with t fie ad
ministration and students to develop an
improved procedure for this in similar
circumstances. They shall present a re
port to the Senate before the end of their
term in office.
