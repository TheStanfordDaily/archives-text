### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
t he No. 3 Stanford women's
tennis team (7-1) is going from
one extreme to the other this
week: having dispatched Hawaii
(0-4) 7-0 yesterday, the Cardinal
takes on No. 14 California (4-0)
this Saturday in Berkeley in its
conference opener.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Tuesday: No. 3 Stanford, 7
Hawaii, 0

"We want to come out in our
next few matches and prove that
we can dominate," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
And the Cardinal certainly
dominated Hawaii. Having won
7-0 in Hawaii back in November,
Stanford completed the series
sweep handily, winning all six
singles matches in straight sets
and losing only one doubles
game.
However, the Cardinal didn't
write off its opponent. Fora team
trying to return to the top rank
ing it lost to Georgia at the Team
Indoors Feb. 9, every match is an
important chance to make a
statement, and every opponent a
learning opportunity.
"They did hit some pretty

shots," freshman Kara Guzman
said of the Rainbow Wahine.
"They were just a little inconsis
tent."
Because Hawaii is a weaker
team than most of Stanford's op
ponents, yesterday gave the
younger players a chance to play
singles, as well as to try out differ
ent doubles teams.
"You never know what's going
to happen," Kalvaria said. "Some
players may get injured, so it's
really beneficial."
Kalvaria and fellow senior
Gabriela Lastra — the nation's top
doubles team — put away Lauren
Fitzgerald and Stacy Hakikawa, 8-
1. Sophomore Emilia Anderson
and freshman Erin Burdette shut
out Brigitte Brubakken and Paige
Mainor, 8-0, and senior Keiko
Tokuda and freshman Story
Tweedie-Yates also blanked their
opponents, Justine Boutet and
Paulina Kravets, 8-0.
Kalvaria, ranked fourth in the
country, led the singles charge,
dispatching Lauren Fitzgerald 6-
3, 7-5. Lastra, ranked No. 11 na
tionally, blanked Hakikawa 6-0,
6-0. Anderson moved up to
third-flight singles and had no
trouble with Brubakken, 6-3,6-2.
