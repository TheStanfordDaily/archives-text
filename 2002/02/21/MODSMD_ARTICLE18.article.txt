### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
t he No. 3 Stanford women's
tennis team (7-1) is going from
one extreme to the other this
week: having dispatched Hawaii
(0-4) 7-0 yesterday, the Cardinal
takes on No. 14 California (4-0)
this Saturday in Berkeley in its
conference opener.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Tuesday: No. 3 Stanford, 7
Hawaii, 0

"We want to come out in our
next few matches and prove that
we can dominate," senior Lauren
Kalvaria said.
And the Cardinal certainly
dominated Hawaii. Having won
7-0 in Hawaii back in November,
Stanford completed the series
sweep handily, winning all six
singles matches in straight sets
and losing only one doubles
game.
However, the Cardinal didn't
write off its opponent. Fora team
trying to return to the top rank
ing it lost to Georgia at the Team
Indoors Feb. 9, every match is an
important chance to make a
statement, and every opponent a
learning opportunity.
"They did hit some pretty

shots," freshman Kara Guzman
said of the Rainbow Wahine.
"They were just a little inconsis
tent."
Because Hawaii is a weaker
team than most of Stanford's op
ponents, yesterday gave the
younger players a chance to play
singles, as well as to try out differ
ent doubles teams.
"You never know what's going
to happen," Kalvaria said. "Some
players may get injured, so it's
really beneficial."
Kalvaria and fellow senior
Gabriela Lastra — the nation's top
doubles team — put away Lauren
Fitzgerald and Stacy Hakikawa, 8-
1. Sophomore Emilia Anderson
and freshman Erin Burdette shut
out Brigitte Brubakken and Paige
Mainor, 8-0, and senior Keiko
Tokuda and freshman Story
Tweedie-Yates also blanked their
opponents, Justine Boutet and
Paulina Kravets, 8-0.
Kalvaria, ranked fourth in the
country, led the singles charge,
dispatching Lauren Fitzgerald 6-
3, 7-5. Lastra, ranked No. 11 na
tionally, blanked Hakikawa 6-0,
6-0. Anderson moved up to
third-flight singles and had no
trouble with Brubakken, 6-3,6-2.

gave Tweedie-Yates, freshman
Kara Guzman and sophomore
Lizzy Bennett a chance to play sin
gles, and they took advantage,
each winning in straight seis.
Tweedie-Yates knocked oil
Kravets, 6-3,6-1, and (iuzman de
feated Mainor 6-2, 6-1. Bennett
finished off the singles sweep,
downing Justine, 6-2, 7-5.
The Cardinal isn't about to
dwell on its dominant perldr

mance, however, since its big
match against the Golden Bears is
looming large.
"Cal's always difficult to play,
especially on their home courts,"
Kalvaria said.
Cal is one of the few teams that
has beaten Stanford during the
current seniors' tenure, Kalvaria
explained. The Cardinal lost at
home to the Bears during the se
niors' freshman year.
This year, Cal once again poses
a threat, with a high national rank
ing and several highly regarded
players. The Cardinal is looking
forward to the challenge.

"We're definitely excited about
it," Guzman said.
For the Bears, Raquel Kops-
Jones is ranked No. 28 in singles,
Christina Fusano checks in at No.
44, and Jieun Jacobs is No. 99.
In doubles, Cal is also formidable,
as Kops-Jones and Carla Arguelles
are ranked No. 21, and Fusano and
Nicole Havlicek come in at No. 43.
It figures to be an exciting
match, as the rivalry tends to bring
out the best in both teams.
Although the Cardinal is
geared up for the match, its prac
tice and preparation routine re
mains unchanged.

"It's pretty much business as
usual," Guzman said.
The match is the Cardinal's
first conference contest of the
year, as well as "our first really big
match away from home," Kalvaria
said.
Stanford is out to prove itself as
the best team in the nation once
again, and knocking off a tough
Berkeley team would do a lot in
that regard.
"Everyone's really excited to
get started in conference play and
get going with the meat of the sea
son," Kalvaria said. "We're going
to try to prove a point."
