### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One. That's all the Cardinal
needed.
One less fall. One more point.
Receiving neither, the No. 11
men's gymnastics team (1-2)
walked away from California's
Haas Pavilion on Friday with one
more loss on the season, being
edged out by the No. 7 Golden
Bears (4-0), 206.350 to 206.050.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS
Friday: No. 7 California, 206.350
No. 11 Stanford, 206.050

This was a match-up in which
Stanford was supposed to be
soundly defeated. Cal, who hadn't
lost a match in its last 30 tries, de
feated the Cardinal three weeks
ago by a comfortable five points, a
margin that borders on a blowout
in the world of gymnastics.
Thirty-one figured to be an
easy win for Cal, despite compet
ing short-handed. But the narrow
margin made this second loss hard
to swallow.
"Not to take anything away from
Cal," said senior co-captain Ricardo
Andrade, "this was our meet to lose
and we lost it. The numbers are
misleading â€” it was a close meet,
but we fell quite a bit short of our
primary goal of improving several
points from the first meet."
As expected, much of the spot
light on Friday was on California's

Ail-American Cody Moore, who
earned a spot on the U.S. National
Team the previous weekend.
Senior co-captain David Du
rante gave Moore a scare, garner
ing a season-high 52.900 in the All
-around. However, he fell short of
Moore's 53.100.
Stanford displayed some flashes
of brilliance in Friday's competi
tion, but its inconsistency under
scored the reason for its 1-2 record.
One of the team's foundations,
Ail-American junior Marshall
Erwin on rings, was rock-solid as
usual, garnering a 9.650, a full
point higher than the highest
Golden Bear score. Aided by Du
rante's 9.050 on the event, Stan
ford went on to win the event by
more than two points.
On the vault, Andrade provid
ed one of the other bright spots of
the night, when he tied for first
with Cal's Moore, earning a 9.050.
Those two events stood in di
rect contrast to Stanford's perfor
mances on the pommel horse and
the horizontal bar, events the team
lost by a combined four points.
Sophomore Daniel Gill, who
scored a 50.350 in the all-around,
and Durante again had solid per
formances on the pommel horse,
but couldn't fully cover for the rest
of their teammates.
On the high bar, one of the
team's most difficult events, An
drade and Durante again led the
