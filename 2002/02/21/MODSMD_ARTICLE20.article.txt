Michele Uhlfelder said that having
a young team is about "knowing
who you are and where you want
to go." And, the Cardinal is head
ed straight for the top.
Stanford (2-0) has started
with victories against UC-Davis
(0-1) and St. Mary's (0-2). This
past Saturday, Stanford beat the
Aggies in a staggering 17-5 win
and continued its success on
Tuesday with a 12-8 victory over
the Gaels.
Against Davis, tri-captain Liz
Britt scored the first goal of the
game for Stanford at 26:19.
The young team came on
strong as the freshmen made their
presence felt. In the first half,
freshman midfielder Nina I'a ti
tan o fired a goal to start a 7-0 scor
ing run for the Cardinal, which in
cluded four goals from freshmen
Julia Calzonetti.
By the end of the game three
other freshmen, Claire Calzonet
ti, Amanda Pettit and Kelsey
Twist, had all notched goals for
the team. The newcomers are a

powerful force this year, com
prising more than a third of the
team (8 of 21 players).
At the other end of ihe field,
junior goalkeepers Virginia
Solomon and Rachael Neumann
each recorded four saves as they
split playing time and put togeth
er a strong defensive game.
Stanford continued its success
against St. Mary's.
"We came out a little slow but
really stepped it up in the sec
ond half," sophomore defender
Katie Grube said. "We were
more settled on attack and more
poised on defense. There was a
big tempo change and we came
out with a lot more heart in the
second half."
Grube and the other defend
ers were successful in shutting
down St. Mary's leading scorer
Megan Bryan, holding her to
one goal.
As Uhlfelder puts it, St. Mary's
gave Stanford the opportunity for
"on the job training."
"It's important to learn how to
quickly adjust to the different style
each game and opponent brings.
[On Tuesday] the team did a real
ly good job at that," she said.
"Being able to adjust is the sign of
a team with potential."
The lessons learned from these
past two games will help prepare
