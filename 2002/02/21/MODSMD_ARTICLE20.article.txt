# Lacrosse readies for key matchup
## Stanford ready to face the No. 5 Orangewomen 
### ANNE NYBORG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Head women's lacrosse coach
Michele Uhlfelder said that having
a young team is about "knowing
who you are and where you want
to go." And, the Cardinal is head
ed straight for the top.
Stanford (2-0) has started
with victories against UC-Davis
(0-1) and St. Mary's (0-2). This
past Saturday, Stanford beat the
Aggies in a staggering 17-5 win
and continued its success on
Tuesday with a 12-8 victory over
the Gaels.
Against Davis, tri-captain Liz
Britt scored the first goal of the
game for Stanford at 26:19.
The young team came on
strong as the freshmen made their
presence felt. In the first half,
freshman midfielder Nina I'a ti
tan o fired a goal to start a 7-0 scor
ing run for the Cardinal, which in
cluded four goals from freshmen
Julia Calzonetti.
By the end of the game three
other freshmen, Claire Calzonet
ti, Amanda Pettit and Kelsey
Twist, had all notched goals for
the team. The newcomers are a

powerful force this year, com
prising more than a third of the
team (8 of 21 players).
At the other end of ihe field,
junior goalkeepers Virginia
Solomon and Rachael Neumann
each recorded four saves as they
split playing time and put togeth
er a strong defensive game.
Stanford continued its success
against St. Mary's.
"We came out a little slow but
really stepped it up in the sec
ond half," sophomore defender
Katie Grube said. "We were
more settled on attack and more
poised on defense. There was a
big tempo change and we came
out with a lot more heart in the
second half."
Grube and the other defend
ers were successful in shutting
down St. Mary's leading scorer
Megan Bryan, holding her to
one goal.
As Uhlfelder puts it, St. Mary's
gave Stanford the opportunity for
"on the job training."
"It's important to learn how to
quickly adjust to the different style
each game and opponent brings.
[On Tuesday] the team did a real
ly good job at that," she said.
"Being able to adjust is the sign of
a team with potential."
The lessons learned from these
past two games will help prepare
the Cardinal for the big home
game opener this weekend. Satur
day, the Ist Annual deßeer's East/
West Challenge will take place on
Maloney Field this Saturday at
noon when the Cardinal take on the
No. 10 Syracuse Orangewomen.
This game not only offers
stiff competition and the op
portunity for Stanford to prac
tice its skills but it also serves as
a big step toward bringing
more East Coast teams out west
for games. Lacrosse has been a
predominantly • East Coast
sport but Stanford is leading

the way in giving it a strong
West Coast presence.
Uhlfelder and the team are
fired up and ready to take on
Syracuse.
"We're excited to improve,"
she said. "We appreciate the fact
that they'll help make us better
opponents and let us know what
the scoreboard won't tell us."
For the team it is about com
mitting to do what it takes to bring
them to the next level of play and
competing at the top. Uhlfelder
knows that their "their feet are
pointed in the right direction".
The players of the Stanford
women's lacrosse team know who
they are. They know where they
want to go; and that is exactly
where they're headed.
