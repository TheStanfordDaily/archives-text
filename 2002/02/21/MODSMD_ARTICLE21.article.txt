# Senior gymnasts are
## Raising the bar Seniors Meldrum, Herbert and Jensen lead the Cardinal 
### SARAH LINDSEY STAFF WRITER 
Girls just want to have fun.
And none want to more than
Katy Herbert, Becky Meldrum,
and Kristin Jensen, the three se
nior captains of the No. 7 Stan
ford's women's gymnastics team.
Whether it was pulling crazy
stunts on spirit days, witnessing
their head coach Kristen Smyth
getting pulled over at 1:30 a.m.
for speeding, watching coach
Steve Ohel wrestle an alligator,
winning a Pacific 10 Conference
championship, or setting several
personal and team records, these
girls have seen and done it all.
"1 think I would like everyone
to remember our class's spirit and
how much fun we had while at
the same time still worked hard,"
Meldrum said.
Starting out as freshmen four
years ago under head coach Mark
Cook, these girls have seen the
gymnastic program through sev
eral adjustments.
At the end of last year, Stanford
decided to revamp the program
by hiring an entirely new coaching
staff. Despite doubts and concerns

about such a drastic decision, the
Cardinal is now flourishing.
"The new coaching staff this
year has been great for every
one," Jensen said.
The coaching changes have
brought along with them the
most important shift for these se
niors: the expectations for Stan

ford gymnastics.
"People expect more from Stan
ford now than they used to," said
Herbert. "We've made a 'name' for
ourselves nationally, and things are
only going to get better."
As their long trek at Stanford
comes to a close, the girls have a
few more goals that they yearn to

achieve before they fold their
Stanford uniforms and put them
away for good.
Listed among their final de
sires as collegiate gymnasts are to
compete in the Super Six and win
another Pac-10 championship.
However, these seniors also
appreciate the things that they al
ready have.
"I want to be able to spend
time with my teammates and
have fun before I graduate,"
Jensen said.
The close bonds formed not
only between the seniors, but also
between the entire team, are evi
dent at each and every meet.
"I love how gymnastics could
be a very individual sport, but
when you come to Stanford, it's
not," said Herbert. "It really
makes you feel like you're a part
of something whether you're on
the floor competing or cheering
fora teammate. You have hex
routine memorized anyway; you
know where her difficulties are,
where she can relax a little. In a
way, you're out there competing
with her."
After all of the cheering and
encouraging, advising and assist
ing the entire team rushes over to
congratulate each and every
gymnast after her performance.
Team closeness might not seem
