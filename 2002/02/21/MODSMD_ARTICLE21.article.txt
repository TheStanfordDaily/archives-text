# Senior gymnasts are
## Raising the bar Seniors Meldrum, Herbert and Jensen lead the Cardinal 
### SARAH LINDSEY STAFF WRITER 
Girls just want to have fun.
And none want to more than
Katy Herbert, Becky Meldrum,
and Kristin Jensen, the three se
nior captains of the No. 7 Stan
ford's women's gymnastics team.
Whether it was pulling crazy
stunts on spirit days, witnessing
their head coach Kristen Smyth
getting pulled over at 1:30 a.m.
for speeding, watching coach
Steve Ohel wrestle an alligator,
winning a Pacific 10 Conference
championship, or setting several
personal and team records, these
girls have seen and done it all.
"1 think I would like everyone
to remember our class's spirit and
how much fun we had while at
the same time still worked hard,"
Meldrum said.
Starting out as freshmen four
years ago under head coach Mark
Cook, these girls have seen the
gymnastic program through sev
eral adjustments.
At the end of last year, Stanford
decided to revamp the program
by hiring an entirely new coaching
staff. Despite doubts and concerns

about such a drastic decision, the
Cardinal is now flourishing.
"The new coaching staff this
year has been great for every
one," Jensen said.
The coaching changes have
brought along with them the
most important shift for these se
niors: the expectations for Stan

ford gymnastics.
"People expect more from Stan
ford now than they used to," said
Herbert. "We've made a 'name' for
ourselves nationally, and things are
only going to get better."
As their long trek at Stanford
comes to a close, the girls have a
few more goals that they yearn to

achieve before they fold their
Stanford uniforms and put them
away for good.
Listed among their final de
sires as collegiate gymnasts are to
compete in the Super Six and win
another Pac-10 championship.
However, these seniors also
appreciate the things that they al
ready have.
"I want to be able to spend
time with my teammates and
have fun before I graduate,"
Jensen said.
The close bonds formed not
only between the seniors, but also
between the entire team, are evi
dent at each and every meet.
"I love how gymnastics could
be a very individual sport, but
when you come to Stanford, it's
not," said Herbert. "It really
makes you feel like you're a part
of something whether you're on
the floor competing or cheering
fora teammate. You have hex
routine memorized anyway; you
know where her difficulties are,
where she can relax a little. In a
way, you're out there competing
with her."
After all of the cheering and
encouraging, advising and assist
ing the entire team rushes over to
congratulate each and every
gymnast after her performance.

like an incredible accomplishment,
but in a sport like gymnastics that
centers on individual competition,
Stanford's team spirit is a valuable
and rare asset.
"I feel really lucky to be a part
of a team that is so close," said
Meldrum. "These girls are some
of my closest friends and 1 want
to thank them for being such a
great part of my experience here
at Stanford."
And the experiences aren't
over yet.
At the Sun Trust Mardi Gras
Madness Quad Meet last Friday,

the Cardinal (6-3, 4-1 Pac-10)
placed second with a 195.700, be
hind Florida, which scored
196.900. Rounding out the top
four at the meet were Penn State
(195.325) and Illinois-Chicago
(194.175).
Meldrum posted a 9.900 to
place fourth on the uneven bars
and four sophomores added vic to
ries of their own.
Kendall Beck tied for second
on the vault with a 9.925, Lise
Leveille finished second on
beam with a 9.875, Lindsay
Wing finished with a 9.850 to tie
for third, and Shelly Goldberg
placeci third on the floor exer
cise with a 9.875.
Herbert, who was the only Stan
ford gymnast to compete in the all

around, placed sixth with a 38.250
total score.
Despite imperfect conditions,
the Cardinal managed to light
through the adversities to show a
lot of heart.
"It was two long days of travel
ing, but everyone kept an upbeat
attitude," Jensen said.
Now, the biggest obstacles for
Stanford to overcome are the little
things. Landings, selling the rou
tines to the crowd, confidence, and
consistency are the minor details
that could make the difference in
the team's final score.
"We are getting better in these
areas, but we still need to work on
putting it together on the road,"
Meldrum said.
But this weekend's matchup

against California (5-4, 1-4 Pac-10)
gives the team another chance to
perfect their skills at home before
the start of post-season meets, in
cluding Pac-10, regional, and na
tional championships.
Friday night's meet at 7:30 in
Burnham Pavilion will be one of
the last chances that seniors Katy
Herbert, Kristin Jensen and
Becky Meldrum will have to lead
the team.
"1 feel like we're setting things
up for the success in the years after
us," Herbert said, "I think Stan
lord's definitely headed fora na
tional championship in the next
couple of years."

of a dynasty, it won't be the end of

like an incredible accomplishment,
but in a sport like gymnastics that
centers on individual competition,
Stanford's team spirit is a valuable
and rare asset.
"I feel really lucky to be a part
of a team that is so close," said
Meldrum. "These girls are some
of my closest friends and 1 want
to thank them for being such a
great part of my experience here
at Stanford."
And the experiences aren't
over yet.
At the Sun Trust Mardi Gras
Madness Quad Meet last Friday,

the Cardinal (6-3, 4-1 Pac-10)
placed second with a 195.700, be
hind Florida, which scored
196.900. Rounding out the top
four at the meet were Penn State
(195.325) and Illinois-Chicago
(194.175).
Meldrum posted a 9.900 to
place fourth on the uneven bars
and four sophomores added vic to
ries of their own.
Kendall Beck tied for second
on the vault with a 9.925, Lise
Leveille finished second on
beam with a 9.875, Lindsay
Wing finished with a 9.850 to tie
for third, and Shelly Goldberg
placeci third on the floor exer
cise with a 9.875.
Herbert, who was the only Stan
ford gymnast to compete in the all

around, placed sixth with a 38.250
total score.
Despite imperfect conditions,
the Cardinal managed to light
through the adversities to show a
lot of heart.
"It was two long days of travel
ing, but everyone kept an upbeat
attitude," Jensen said.
Now, the biggest obstacles for
Stanford to overcome are the little
things. Landings, selling the rou
tines to the crowd, confidence, and
consistency are the minor details
that could make the difference in
the team's final score.
"We are getting better in these
areas, but we still need to work on
putting it together on the road,"
Meldrum said.
But this weekend's matchup

against California (5-4, 1-4 Pac-10)
gives the team another chance to
perfect their skills at home before
the start of post-season meets, in
cluding Pac-10, regional, and na
tional championships.
Friday night's meet at 7:30 in
Burnham Pavilion will be one of
the last chances that seniors Katy
Herbert, Kristin Jensen and
Becky Meldrum will have to lead
the team.
"1 feel like we're setting things
up for the success in the years after
us," Herbert said, "I think Stan
lord's definitely headed fora na
tional championship in the next
couple of years."
But while this may be the start
of a dynasty, it won't be the end of
fun for these girls.
Girls just want to have fun.
And none want to more than
Katy Herbert, Becky Meldrum,
and Kristin Jensen, the three se
nior captains of the No. 7 Stan
ford's women's gymnastics team.
Whether it was pulling crazy
stunts on spirit days, witnessing
their head coach Kristen Smyth
getting pulled over at 1:30 a.m.
for speeding, watching coach
Steve Ohel wrestle an alligator,
winning a Pacific 10 Conference
championship, or setting several
personal and team records, these
girls have seen and done it all.
"1 think I would like everyone
to remember our class's spirit and
how much fun we had while at
the same time still worked hard,"
Meldrum said.
Starting out as freshmen four
years ago under head coach Mark
Cook, these girls have seen the
gymnastic program through sev
eral adjustments.
At the end of last year, Stanford
decided to revamp the program
by hiring an entirely new coaching
staff. Despite doubts and concerns

about such a drastic decision, the
Cardinal is now flourishing.
"The new coaching staff this
year has been great for every
one," Jensen said.
The coaching changes have
brought along with them the
most important shift for these se
niors: the expectations for Stan

ford gymnastics.
"People expect more from Stan
ford now than they used to," said
Herbert. "We've made a 'name' for
ourselves nationally, and things are
only going to get better."
As their long trek at Stanford
comes to a close, the girls have a
few more goals that they yearn to

achieve before they fold their
Stanford uniforms and put them
away for good.
Listed among their final de
sires as collegiate gymnasts are to
compete in the Super Six and win
another Pac-10 championship.
However, these seniors also
appreciate the things that they al
ready have.
"I want to be able to spend
time with my teammates and
have fun before I graduate,"
Jensen said.
The close bonds formed not
only between the seniors, but also
between the entire team, are evi
dent at each and every meet.
"I love how gymnastics could
be a very individual sport, but
when you come to Stanford, it's
not," said Herbert. "It really
makes you feel like you're a part
of something whether you're on
the floor competing or cheering
fora teammate. You have hex
routine memorized anyway; you
know where her difficulties are,
where she can relax a little. In a
way, you're out there competing
with her."
After all of the cheering and

ing the entire team rushes over to
