# Cruise, Stewart or Condit could lead the Raider nation
## 
### 
The comedy of errors that was
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers'
search fora head coach over
the last month finally ended
with the prying of Bay Area favorite Jon
Gruden from the Oakland Raiders on
Monday morning.
But while the Raider nation is wallow
ing in its sorrow and looking with uneasy
anticipation at the appointment of a new
head coach, Raiders owner A1 Davis
should take this opportunity to anoint a
new era of Raider greatness by not follow
ing the conventional path.
The experts are putting their money
on the hiring of former Minnesota
Vikings and Stanford coach Dennis
Green, former Los Angeles Raiders coach
Art Shell or current Raiders offensive co-

ordinator Bill Callahan.
But it would be a mistake
for Davis to listen to the
unimaginative advice of
overpaid analysts on this
issue. Right now is the
moment for the NFL's
original rebel owner to
make a rebel move.
So let's fora moment

cast aside the list of usual suspects from
the coaching carousel and try to think
outside the box of the people who can
produce winners, have great organiza
tional skills, and know how to work with
people. The first name that conies to my
mind is Tom Cruise.
Now some "experts" out there may
have reservations about hiring a 5'5" 1 10l

lywood actor with absolutely no football
experience to be a head coach, but with a
resume like Cruise's, the Raiders can't af
ford not to hire him. Here's a guy that took
an ordinary movie about fighter pilots and
turned it into one of the mainstays on
TNT's prime-time classic movie lineup.
And talk about organizational ;ind peo
ple skills. He once led a team of wanted
fugitives to break into the CIA headquar
ters, recover the list of undercover agents,
and save the world from the deadly virus
Chimera, all while managing a feud with
his star player (that French guy with the
knife and the funny accent).
To be fair, Cruise is far from perfect â€”
lie did make "Vanilla Sky." But, we all have
our off days. But how many of us can say
that even on our off days we still got to bang

both Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz?
Perhaps Davis might even take this op
portunity to break an even bigger bound
ary that no one has dared to cross since the
days ofGoldie Hawn in "Wildcats."
Perhaps it's time to bring in a female
coach to prove to the world that women
are every bit as ruthless, maniacal, and ca
pable of stringing together long chains of
expletives as their male counterparts.
And of all top female candidates,
Martha Stewart clearly stands head and
shoulders above the rest.
With the recent collapse of the K-Mart
empire, Stewart is most likely looking fora
new organization on which to affix her
household name.
And what says clean old-fashioned fam
ily values like the Oakland Raiders? That

Stewart is the epitome of organizational ef
ficiency is an understatement.
In choosing her as the new coach, the
Raiders would instantly gain new credibil
ity in both their baking and housewares
departments, two areas in which the Gru
den-era Raiders were seriously lacking.
Davis would effectively be combining
the positions 6f head coach, head cheer
leader, nutritionist and equipment man
ager / designer into one all-powerful posi
tion. With all that, who even needs a GM?
Possibly the most compelling draw to
Martha Stewart lies in the fact that Oak
land could replace the perceived evil that
Jon Gruden brought to the table, with his
close resemblance to the Ghucky Doll
