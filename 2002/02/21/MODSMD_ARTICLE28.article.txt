### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
After five seasons of Pacific 10
Conference drama, the only thing
standing between the Cardinal and
another perfect regular season in the
Pac-10 is a 600-mile road trip to Los
Angeles.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Today: No. 2 Stanford at USC,
7:00 p.m., Los Angeles
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford at UCLA,
2:00 p.m., Los Angeles

The No. 2 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (26-1, 16-0 Pac-10) heads
south to face Southern California (14-
11, 10-6) on Friday and UCLA (7-18,
3-13) on Sunday.
Stanford defeated both teams
once already this season and wants
to make a clean sweep of not only the
Los Angeles schools but of the whole
conference.
'I"he Cardinal leads the overall series
against the Trojans 28 games to 15 and
has won 15 of the last 16 contests. De
spite the numbers, though, USC is not
a squad to be overlooked.
Stanford hasn't forgotten the Tro
jans' 62-59 upset last season and how,
during their first meeting back on Dec.
30, the team made a late run to scare
the Cardinal. Though Stanford never
trailed in that game, USC cut the lead
to two points with five minutes left be
fore senior guard Lauren St. Clair
nailed a huge 3-pointer to put the
game out of reach.

Freshman Azella Perryman and the rest of Tara VanDerveer's N0.2-
ranked squad will look to complete a perfect Pac-10 season against USC
and UCLA beginning tonight.
Pac-10 Basketball Standings

Forward Fboriy Hoffman and
guard Tiffany Elmore led the Tro
jan charge as Hoffman collected a
double-double on the night, scoring
22 points and grabbing 12 re
bounds. Elmore also came close to
a double-double of her own after
scoring 19 points and pulling down
9 boards.
The Cardinal won't face such a
strong threat on Sunday when it
heads into Pauley Pavilion. UCLA
has suffered a disappointing season
since losing its leading scorer,
Michelle Greco, to injuries at the be
ginning of conference play.
The Bruins fell 81-50 to the Car
dinal earlier in the season. UCLA,
stayed in the game in the first half
and found itself down by only eight
at the first buzzer.
Stanford returned from the lock
er room to dominate the second
half, outscoring the Bruins 42-15 in
the last 17:30 for the easy win.
Although the team has already
clinched the Pac-10 regular season
title as well as the No. 1 seed in the
inaugural Pac-10 Tournament, the
Cardinal is not about to overlook
this weekend's matchups.
"People are excited to finish
strong, so we can talk about the Pac
-10 tourney and the NCAAs," said
head coach Lara VanDerveer.
Stanford has shown no sign of
slowing down lately.

Sophomore forward Nicole
Powell collected her third triple
double of the season and the fourth
in her collegiate career against
Washington last week in the game
that gave the Cardinal the No. 1
seed outright.
Senior guard Lindsey Yamasaki
followed up her teammate's perfor
mance on Saturday with a stellar
game of her own, collecting a team
high 18 points in front of the Maples
faithful who turned out to celebrate
Senior Day.
The rest of the Cardinal bench
has demonstrated a great deal of
tenacity on the court as well. Fresh
man reserve Azella Perryman,
nabbed her second career double
double against Washington State
after scoring 13 points and pulling
down 16 boards.
Aside from distributing the play
ing time, the team has some specific
aspects ofthe game it will look to im
prove on this weekend.
"It's key to rebound," said Van-
Derveer. "We need to cut back on
the turnovers and have a little more
variety [in the offense] with differ
ent people contributing."
In the last contests before tour
nament play, VanDerveer knows
what is critical for her team.
"The most important thing is that
we continue to improve and we stay
healthy," said VanDerveer. "What's
going to be really important is that
we play well. I think it more of a mo
mentum thing â€” we need to build
momentum and we don't want to
waste any opportunity."
