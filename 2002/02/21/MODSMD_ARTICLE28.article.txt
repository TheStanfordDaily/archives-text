### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
After five seasons of Pacific 10
Conference drama, the only thing
standing between the Cardinal and
another perfect regular season in the
Pac-10 is a 600-mile road trip to Los
Angeles.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Today: No. 2 Stanford at USC,
7:00 p.m., Los Angeles
Saturday: No. 2 Stanford at UCLA,
2:00 p.m., Los Angeles

The No. 2 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (26-1, 16-0 Pac-10) heads
south to face Southern California (14-
11, 10-6) on Friday and UCLA (7-18,
3-13) on Sunday.
Stanford defeated both teams
once already this season and wants
to make a clean sweep of not only the
Los Angeles schools but of the whole
conference.
'I"he Cardinal leads the overall series
against the Trojans 28 games to 15 and
has won 15 of the last 16 contests. De
spite the numbers, though, USC is not
a squad to be overlooked.
Stanford hasn't forgotten the Tro
jans' 62-59 upset last season and how,
during their first meeting back on Dec.
30, the team made a late run to scare
the Cardinal. Though Stanford never
trailed in that game, USC cut the lead
to two points with five minutes left be
fore senior guard Lauren St. Clair
nailed a huge 3-pointer to put the
game out of reach.

Freshman Azella Perryman and the rest of Tara VanDerveer's N0.2-
ranked squad will look to complete a perfect Pac-10 season against USC
and UCLA beginning tonight.
