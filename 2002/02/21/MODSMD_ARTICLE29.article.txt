# L.A. Story awaits Cardinal
## Tough games with Trojans and Bruins will decide tourney seed 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Things have changed quite a
bit in the wacky world of West
Coast basketball since Stanford's

last trip down to Los Angeles four
weeks ago.
In the first halfof the season the
Cardinal was still struggling to find
its identity back then, still trying to
figure out its place in the Pacific 10
Conference.
Since then, Stanford has
edged closer to realizing its po
tential. Any doubts about
whether or not this Cardinal
squad is capable of winning this

thing should no longer exist.
The next two games should go a
long way in clearing up matters, as
tonight the Cardinal (17-0, 10-4
Pat-10) will battle co-conference
leader USC (18-6,10-4 Pac-10) and
then entertain UCLA (17-8,9-5 Pac
-10) on Saturday at Maples Pavilion.
In the first half of the season,
Stanford's ability to put together a
winning streak was nonexistent.
The power forward position re
mained a constant question mark
and the Cardinal's inability to exe
cute against the press exposed
shaky point guard play.
With all that said, is it really pos
sible that Stanford is a different
team? Has the Cardinal really
tamed its demons?
Since its 90-82 loss to the Tro
jans four weeks ago, Stanford has
shown that it can piece together a
winning streak â€” Entering into
tonight's game against USC, the
Cardinal has won four in a row.
The loss to the Trojans also
forced Montgomery to entertain a
few more options at the power for
ward position. Recent starterTeyo
Johnson has stepped in and
brought a lot of energy to the Car
dinal front line, and sophomore
Joe Kirchofer has proved that he
can play solid defense and re
bound when needed.
Stanford's ability to handle the
press may be the biggest remain
ing question mark. Washington's
use of the full court press gave Car

regular season winds down.
dinal fans a scare as they huddled
around a radio trying to figure out
what was going on in Seattle, al
though the team withstood the
pressure to pull out a victory.
"We just have to deal with [the
press]," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "Hie team
just has to make the plays, but I am
seeing improvements. USC uses
the press and they do it well. They
are very quick and unfortunately
we can't simulate that in practice.
"Guys have to make the plays.
Last time we played hot potato
and passed it way too quick, and
that shows up on tape. If they
start trapping, we have to find the
open man."
Not only is USC's press a threat
to Stanford's winning streak, hut
so is Trojan senior center/for
ward Sam Clancy.
Clancy is fourth in the confer
ence in scoring at 19 points per
game and is the second-leading re
bounder at 9.9 per game. The
Cardinal couldn't find an answer
for the 6-foot-7, 240-pound for
ward in its last meeting with USC.
He had 24 points and 13 re
bounds that went unmatched be
cause Stanford center Curtis
Borchardt was sidelined with an
injury.
"[ Borchardt's absence] was defi
nitely a factor, but the turnovers we
made killed us," said Montgomery.
"He is our best passing big guy. We
have to have an outside game and
Henry Bibby works real hard on
matchups. That will be more diffi
cult with Curtis in there. 1 laving to
guard Curtis is something people
have to consider."

Luckily for Stanford, Bor
chardt will be available for
tonight's game. 1 lowever, the Car
dinal will have to make do without
the services of sophomore forward
Justin Davis, who will not play in
tonight's game because of a
bruised rib suffered last week
against Washington State.
Against the Bruins, junior
Jason Kapono is still the biggest
threat to Cardinal success.
Kapono is a strong candidate
for Pac-10 Player of the Year hon
ors along with Clancy and Jacob
sen. The savvy shooting guard's
offensive presence has warranted
many comparisons between him
and Jacobsen. Consequently, the
matchup between these two play
ers is always intriguing.
Jacobsen came out on top the
last time the two met. Despite only
scoring four more points, Jacob
sen's team swaggered out of hos
tile Pauley Pavilion with its fifth
straight win.
The Bruins are also accus
tomed to winning at Maples,
though, and the Cardinal know it.
"UCLA probably feels the
same way about playing here at
Maples that we do about playing
at Pauley," Barnes said.
" They've beaten us the last two
years here when we were ranked
No. 1 and so I'm sure they're
going to have some kind of con
fidence coming in. They've been
very successful here in years
past, which is something we have
to keep in mind."
'These probably will be the
biggest games of the year for us in
terms of meeting two solid teams
and establishing ourselves and
making us the front runners
going into next week's games
against Arizona," said junior
Julius Barnes."
