University President John Hennessy announced
on Feb 15 that The Atlantic Philanthropies has made
a $5 million grant to Stanford's John W. Gardner
Center for Youth and Their Communities.
"Stanford University is delighted that The Atlantic
Philanthropies will make a major investment in the
Gardner Center, reflecting that organization's admi
ration for John Gardner and his many contributions
to American society," Hessessy said in the Stanford
News Service.
According to its mission statement, the center is
dedicated to bringing together different factions of
society in an effort to support and alleviate the prob
lems of America's youth through education, research
and interaction with schools and the government.
According to Hennessy, the gift will help support
educational and research programs that Gardner
considered to be of utmost importance. He said it may
also serve to encourage other organizations to make
similar grants.
The grant was made in honor of Gardner, a con
sulting professor in the School of Education and social
reform activist who established the center in Septem
ber of 2000. Gardner passed away at his campus
home on Saturday at the age of 89 due to complica

tions from cancer.
Alan Ruby, senior vice president at The Atlantic
Philanthropies in New York, stated the purpose be
hind the grant and explained that his organization
holds Gardner's mission in high regard.
"We are supporting the John Gardner Center be
cause John Gardner is one of the great people of the
20th Century," Ruby said in the Report. "Gardner is
passionate about making the lives of young Ameri
cans richer in spirit and more purposeful by being en
gaged in making their communities better and safer
places.
"The center seeks to continue and extend his out
standing work by encouraging diverse groups to
work together."
According to Ruby, Atlantic Philanthropies seeks
to support and maintain the Gardner Center's efforts
through its grant.
According to Education Professor Milbrey
McLaughlin, executive director of the Gardner Cen
ter, the grant will not only strengthen the current ef
forts of the center, but also will allow it to greatly in
crease the scale of its work.
"With this gift, the center will be able to take on a
national role in generating knowledge and connect
ing diverse people and organizations to advance their

work with children and youth,"
McLaughlin said. "It also enables
the center to maintain a strong
core team and deepen and extend
its early promising projects. These
include local policy and program
work in Redwood City, Oakland
and other Bay Area communities."
According to his colleagues,
Gardner believed that societal
problems could be prevented by
paying closer attention to the diffi
culties afflicting the nation's youth.
"If you want to train leaders,
you have to start early," Gardner
once said." If you want to keep kids
out of prison, you have to start
early. But it isn't easily done."
Gerhard Casper, university
president from 1992 to 2000,

praised Gardner for his forward
looking goals and positivism.
"Nobody has a stronger belief
in society's potential, in the poten
tial of institutions, than John
Gardner," Casper said at the time
of the grant's announcement.
"The commitment to renewal that
he has displayed throughout a life
of action and reflection continues
to be a great encouragement to his
alma mater, to which he remains
as close as ever.
"[The Gardner Center] will
focus people once again on one of
John's central themes â€” think
[about] possibilities, rather than
obstacles. It is wonderful that
Stanford may do its part to contin
ue the legacy."
The grant, which will be dis
tributed over four years begin
ning in July, is contingent on
Stanford raising matching
funds.
