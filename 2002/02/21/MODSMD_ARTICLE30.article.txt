# Casey Jacobsen:
## Thriving in the spotlight 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The first time Curds Borchardt met
Casey Jacobsen, it was at a USA Basketball
developmental festival in the summer of
1998. When Borchardt asked how many
points Jacobsen averaged per game, the
Glendora native answered, "33."
"I was like, this guy must play in the
scrubbiest league ever," Borchardt said.
"He was a kid with acne from Southern
California with highlighted hair. I was
like — he can't be that good."
Former Stanford center Tim Young
was similarly skeptical. When Jacobsen
stepped onto the Maples Pavilion court
for the first time to play a pickup game
with the 1998-99 team, Young gave him
an intentional elbow to the chest.
"1 was like, 'Oh, boy,' "Jacobsen said.
"I think he was trying to let me know that
I was still a senior in high school and that
he was the big dog here."
Three years, 1,583 points and 215 3-
pointers later, there is no question that
Jacobsen has proven he is 'that good'
and that he is a 'big dog' on Stanford's
team. A 2000-01 All-American, the ju
nior wingman has scored the most
points in a collegiate game this season
(49 against Arizona State) and has led
the Cardinal in minutes (35.0), points
(22.5) and assists (3.5).
His name appears in the Stanford
record books 39 times, and he is a viable
candidate for the John Wooden Award
and for Pacific 10 Conference Player of
the Year.
Jacobsen has even battled through a
myriad of preseason expectations and si
lenced critics who wrote him off after a 3-
of-17 performance in a loss to Texas in
December.
"He's just stayed into it the whole time,"
senior point guard Tony Giovacchini said.
"Lately, he's been awesome. That's a trib
ute to how tough he is mentally and how
well he understands the game."
Yet, while Jacobsen has constantly
proven himself as a threat on the basket

ball court, one of his biggest challenges is
completely out of his hands: He still faces
the burden of sometimes being misrepre
sented as a person.
The media has at times portrayed Ja
cobsen as arrogant because he is so self
assured when he's on the court and when
he answers questions before or after
games, jacobsen even admitted that his
"super-confident" attitude toward bas
ketball often distorts people's feelings
about the kind of person he is.
Take his interviews with the Los Ange
les media last month, in which Jacobsen
said he enjoyed playing at Pauley Pavil
ion. When UCLA coach Steve Lavin post
ed those words in the Bruins locker room
as a motivational tool, the players and
press had a field day, touting Pauley in
one headline as "Casey's Castle."
"That's the price that comes with being
interviewed a lot, and I accept that," Ja
cobsen said. "I've always tried to be hon
est with the media. But people who are
honest could be taken out of context. I've
been burned a couple times for little
things the past three years."
In fact, because everything that Ja
cobsen does is on the basketball court or
in the media room, his naysayers may
never see him for the other roles he
plays in his life.
Like the excellent storyteller he is on
the team bus and a guy who can make
everybody laugh, according to redshirt
freshman forward Nick Robinson.
Or the surprisingly good dancer he
was at a nightclub in Australia when the
team traveled there last summer ("He's
got rhythm," sophomore guard Matt Lot
ticli said.).
Or the practical jokester who joined
his teammates in calling their hotel on a
roadtrip, impersonating the coaching
staff so that the concierge would tape an
episode of "Survivor," according to
sophomore forward Joe Kirchofer.
Simply put, the easy going side of Ja
cobsen is rarely addressed instead of his
basketball demeanor.
As the only returning starter, Jacobsen

has also faced sharp criticism from out
siders about the co-captain's unwilling
ness to take an active vocal role in team
huddles.
"I could be a better vocal leader and
maybe I should," Jacobsen said. "But
anybody can tell someone else what to do.
1 hated kids like that in grade school and
high school and I told myself I'd never be
that type of person.
"Maybe it's taking it to the other ex
treme, but that's been my motto about
leadership: 'Actions speak louder than
words.'"
I lis game-winning shot over then-No.
1 Duke last season certainly spoke vol
umes, and his four 30-plus point perfor
mances this year have done the same.
Jacobsen hasn't let any distractions
blur his focus, from his goals in life to
those on the basketball court. He said he
still takes one minute before every game
to reflect on his life and to look at the
Sixth Man Club to remind himself of how
lucky he is to be playing in front of such a
supportive crowd.
"Players who never went to college
and went straight to the pros never get to
feel that. They never get to have people
their own age cheering for you," Jacob
sen said. "There's a lot to be said for just
going to college."
Jacobsen is certainly more mature
than he was when he first arrived at Stan
ford three years ago. But he is just as
proud on the court as he was when, as an
18-year-old freshman, he stood up to
then-senior David Moseley on one of the
first days of practice.
"They were jawing at each other the
whole time," junior guard Julius Barnes
said. "Even as a freshman, it showed that
Casey wouldn't take anything from any
body. He was going to play his hardest
and not let anything get in his way."
Not his opponents. And not his critics.
Said Jacobsen: "Now I feel like I have
a little more sense of peace on the basket
ball court. My focus now is to enjoy the
game, enjoy my teammates and not to
take anything for granted."

Casey Jacobsen's exploits on the court have been well-documented, but his persdnality
off the court isn't as well known — except, of course, to his teammates and coaches.
