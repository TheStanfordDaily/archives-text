Men's Tale of the Tape
USC frojans Stanford Cardinal UCLA Bruins
18-6 Record 17-6 Record 17-8

And suddenly, just like that, everything fell
into place for the Cardinal.
It was as easy as " 1,2,3."
1. Pacific 10 Conference leader and No. 14-
ranked Arizona picked the perfect weekend to
go 0-2 in Los Angeles (although the Wildcats
beat Arizona State last night to pull back into a
first place tie).
2. No. 25 UCLA decided to show its two
faced nature. After upsetting the Wildcats on
Thursday evening in a heart-stopping 77-76
victory at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins, be
came an upset victim themselves two days
later in losing to a less-talented but still tough
Arizona State squad.
3. California couldn't manage to escape the
so-called "easy" trip to Washington without a
blunder, falling 75-60 to the Huskies.
With these three little mishaps, suddenly the
world all makes sense again for Stanford play
ers and fans.
After two days of riveting Pac-10 play, the
No. 10 Cardinal reclaimed a share of the lead-

ers' throne, re-establishing itself atop the tu
multuous saga that is the Pac-10.
Surprised yet?
"Right now there are six teams that have a
chance to win the conference," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "I thought
the league was well-balanced [from the begin
ning]. It is just too tough from top to bottom,
and some people underestimated some
teams."
Are you wondering where Southern Califor
nia and Oregon came from? Well you obvious
ly haven't been paying close attention, because
the Trojans and Ducks have been "comfort
ably" sitting in first place for weeks now.
Not sure how Arizona managed to rebound
from a devastating NBA draft day last year?
The leadership of Luke Walton and Jason
Gardner have played a pivotal role in this
team's "revival."
Can't quite figure out why the Bruins strug
gled so much against Arizona State last week
end? No one can, really.
Sometimes the cards just fall on your side,
but this past weekend the whole deck came
crashing down in Stanford's favor. Irrational

losses occurred (Cal's loss to Washington), un
expected mental lapses were seen (UCLA's loss
to Arizona State) and talent came up just short
of victory a couple times (yes, you, Arizona).
Statistically, this past weekend really isn't
that significant. One game separates the con
ference's top six teams. In reality, not much was
gained or lost by any team, well except possibly,
a psychological edge.
It can't be a great feeling to be UCLA right
now. Currently tied for fifth place with Cal, it is
wondering if a berth in the National Invitation
al Tournament is in its near future.
And as usual there's no security at. the top,
either.
With each team having four games left to play
(excluding Arizona, which only has two games
left), the regular season is still far from over.
"We would like to finish on top, but one
game will not be the downfall," Montgomery
said. "We have to go out and do the best we can,
we have four tough games ahead. The impor
tant thing now is to get enough wins to ensure
a spot in the NCAA, and then winning the con
ference tournament. The team knows what we
have left, the excitement speaks for itself."
