TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Salim Stoudamire
could see what was happening — caught up in
(he intensity of their dislike of Arizona State,
his Arizona teammates were letting the game
slip away.
The freshman came to the rescue, scoring
the last two baskets for the 14th-ranked Wild
cats as they held on to beat the Sun Devils 83-75
Wednesday night, four weeks after they were
stunned by an upset loss in Tempe.
Stoudamire, who had 24 points, said a scuffle
that resulted in the ejection of an Arizona State
player took the Wildcats out of their game.
1 think we were going down and trying to get
them back after what happened instead of
going down and playing our game," he said.
"In the first half, we were tough, and then we
got into that altercation, and I thought we tried
to focus on getting them back instead of win
ning the game."
Stoudamire hit a 3-pointer that made it 72-
66 with 4:28 left, and tipped in a miss by Luke
Walton with 41 seconds to play that gave the
Wildcats a 78-73 lead.
The Wildcats rode out the victory at the free
throw line, glad to be there after allowing Ari
zona State to recover from an 18-point deficit in
the first half.

Arizona (18-8, 11-5 Pac-10) had lost to
UCLA and Southern California in Los Angeles
over the weekend and was trying to avoid los
ing three straight regular-season games for the
first time since 1983-84. That team had losing
streaks of six, four and three games during
coach Lute Olson s first year with the program.
"This definitely was a battle," Olson said. "I
give ASU a lot of credit for the way they battled.
ASU is a tough team, and they work hard and
defend hard. They make it difficult for teams to
run their plays."
With a win, Arizona kept its hopes alive fora
conference championship, remaining just be
hind USC, Stanford and Oregon, all tied for
first place with 10-4 records.
kick Anderson had 17 points and nine re
bounds, and Jason Gardner added 16 points for
Arizona. Walton, who had scored in double fig
ures in 17 games, was 3-for-12 and finished with
eight points, but had 10 assists and six rebounds.
"1 felt good coming in," Walton said. "I was
ready to play, I just couldn't get it going all
night long. 1 was turning it over, missing layins,
so I just didn't do much to help the team."
Arizona State's Curtis Millage had a career
high 27 points.
"We came out with low energy," Millage
said. "We didn't come out and play hard. VVe
picked it up at the end, but we should have
started off the game picking tip our energy and
our defense, been more patient offensively, and
we could have come out with a victory."
Chad Prewitt had 15 points and eight re

bounds for the Sun Devils (14-11,7-9), who beat
Arizona 88-72 in Tempe on Jan. 23 — their first
win in 13 tries against their most bitter rival.
But Prewitt hurt his calf with 1:22 left and
limped from the court.
Isaiah Fox fouled out trying to block Pre
witt's 3-point attempt. Brad Nahra, who re
placed Prewitt at the line, missed all three free
throws, and Arizona retained its 75-71 lead.
Coach Rob Evans said Prewitt hurt his left
foot and would have it examined when the
team returned home.
"This was a hard-fought game," Evans said.
"Arizona jumped on us and our guys fought
back."
Prewitt was the second Sun Devil in the
dressing room when the game ended.
With 6:01 left in the first half, Arizona State's
Kyle Dodd, a reserve guard, piled on while
teammate Chris Osborne and Walton were
wrestling fora rebound.
After a scuffle, Dodd was ejected, and
Stoudamire made two technical free throws for
a 39-21 lead, Arizona's biggest of the game.
Millage, who had tied it at 58 with a layup a
minute before, made an 8-footer that gave Ari
zona State a 60-58 lead with 9:36 left.
Dennis Latimore gave Arizona a 63-62 lead
with a three-point play with 10:41 left,
Stoudamire made a layup and Channing Frye
scored on a goaltending called with 7:37 to go.
The 67-62 lead stood up, although Smith had
two baskets, the latter a 15-footer on the baseline
that narrowed it to 67-66 with 5:23 to play.
