# Michigan isn't the only one...
## Stanford's fabulous five 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As they stood in a circle with
their arms linked at center court,
one couldn't help but think how
far the women's basketball team's
five seniors had come — as play
ers and individuals, yes, but most
importantly as a team.
This year's Senior Day at
Maples Pavilion had a little bit dif
ferent feel than it has the past two
seasons. While the crowd was on
its feet recognizing the years of
hand work, great plays and won
derful personality these five indi
viduals had brought to Stanford
women's basketball, nobody could
help but hope this wouldn't be the
last time they would acknowledge
their accomplishments.
"We don't want this to be our
last home game," said guard
Lindsey Yamasaki after Satur
day's 76-50 win over Washington
State."I think today was a sign of
how far we have come; however, if
all goes right we should still have
11 games left to play."
Centers Cori Enghusen and
Bethany Donaphin and guards
Lauren St. Clair, Enjoli Izidor
and Yamasaki all made their way
to the Farm four years ago for dif
ferent reasons. While individual
aspirations may have been a dri
ving factor in their decisions, no
one can doubt that the strong tra
dition of Stanford women's bas
ketball was a major motivating
force.
With a string of top-ranked
teams, Final Four appearances
and even two national champi
onships in the early 1990'5, Stan
ford was on the short list of the na
tion's elite women's basketball
programs. Add 1996 Olympic
gold medal-winning coach Tara
VanDerveer to the mix (one of the

most prestigious names in the
sport), and one can't help but
equate signing with Stanford as
spending four years among the
nation's best.
While the road to success is
usually a long and bumpy one,

this year's seniors understand the
meaning of delayed gratification
better than anyone. Finally, after
three seasons of Pac-10 woes and
early NCAA exits, the group is fi
nally where it always expected to
be — contending fora national

championship.
"It is kind of symbolic of our
evolution as a group," Yamasaki
said. "We're part of bringing Stan
ford back to its tradition."
While everyone is talking
about sophomore forward Nicole

Powell and the quartet of top
freshmen, the return to greatness
can largely be seen as a product of
the seniors' success. And for each
of the five, the growing pains
along the way only serve to mag
nify each athlete's individual con
tributions.
For Yamasaki, these contribu
tions were called on early in her
career. As a freshman she led the
squad in scoring, and looked to be
the next Cardinal star to enter the
picture. But because she was re
cruited as a two-sport athlete, Ya
masaki didn't join the team until
January of her sophomore year
after playing on the Cardinal vol
leyball team.
Over the next two seasons, Ya
masaki's contributions were
streaky. She saw limited minutes,
and fought to demonstrate her
commitment to basketball to the
coaching staff.
After deciding to focus on
hoops in her senior season, Ya
masaki has demonstrated that she
is the real deal. A consistent offen
sive threat from both inside and
the perimeter, she has once again
led the Cardinal in scoring all sea
son and has started every game.
Both Enghusen and Donaphin
offer the Cardinal strong options
on the inside.
Donaphin, like Yamasaki,
stepped up and contributed right
away for the Cardinal, starting
several games her freshman sea
son. She has posted a 52 percent
field goal mark over the course of
her career, and has established
herself as one of Stanford's pre
mier shot blockers.
Enghusen, the tallest player in
Stanford history at 6-foot-7, has
had some big games for the Car
dinal. In the 2001 NCAA tourna
ment she defined herself as a play
er, posting back-to-back 14-point

evenings, and a school-record six
blocked shots in Stanford's second
round loss to Oklahoma.
In her final year Enghusen con
tinues to give quality minutes on
the floor. She is the type of player
that can explode and change a
game, as witnessed with strong
performances at Washington and
Washington State this season.
Rounding out the senior roster
are guards Izidor and St. Clair.
While both have seen limited min
utes this season, the leadership
and composure they bring to the
floor are unmatched.
Primarily a slasher in high
school, St. Clair will probably be
remembered most on the court
for her beautiful 3-point shot. Her
career mark of 40 percent is the
seventh-best in Pac-10 history.
This season she has been called
upon primarily to defend some of
the top perimeter players in the
Pac-10.
Izidor has proved to be a versa
tile player for the Cardinal. Pri
marily playing post in her first two
seasons, she stepped up and took
over some of the major ball-han
dling responsibilities for Stanford
last season.
While the seniors have all dis
tinguished themselves individu
ally in their years at the Farm,
their biggest contribution has
been their ability to grow togeth
er. More than any other group of
players to have come through the
program, they have seen Stan
ford basketball at its best and its
worst.
But while reflection is impor
tant all five seniors are presently
focused on the future. They all
came to Stanford with the dream
of a national championship ring,
and while they have come a long
way, there is still a long way left
to go.
