## Poll results reveal quality-of life concerns 
### RAVNEET KAUR 
The Graduate Student Coun
cil recently released the results of
an online survey on quality-of
life issues for Stanford's graduate
students.
The Web-based survey was im
plemented in November and re
ceived 2091 responses, represent
ing approximately 28 percent of

the graduate-stu
dent population.
"Previous surveys
undertaken by grad
uate student repre-

sentatives in 1998 and 2000 fo
cused predominantly on housing
issues," said Filipe Santos, GSC
chair and a doctoral candidate in
management science and engi
neering. "While the largest compo
nent of this survey is the housing
situation, other aspects of graduate
life — such as graduate students'
overall financial situation, health
care, child care, parking and social
life — were also investigated."
Ray Rivera, a second-year doc
toral candidate in the School of
Education and financial director
of the GSC, discussed the results
of the survey.
"Students feel their quality of
life is greatly compromised by,
first, a labyrinthine process by
which to obtain housing, which
many students report to be ex
tremely disruptive to their stud
ies, and on top of that extremely
offensive; second, the lack of af
fordable heath care — especially
for dependents and children —
with benefits and cost structures
equal to those available from em
ployers if the students were work
ing; third, the extremely high
costs and low availability of child
care, and the general child-un
friendly manner of child care ser
vices and the campus in general;
[and] fourth, the lack of parking
available for off-campus stu
dents," Rivera said.
Stijii van Nieuwerburg a
fourth-year doctoral candidate in
economics and coordinator of the
task force in charge of the survey,
also commented on the results.
"[Graduate students] want sta
bility in their housing situation."
van Nieuwerburg said. "Right now
the current housing system is set up
in such a manner that some stu
dents who prefer to live on campus
live off campus and vice versa.

There is way too much unnecessary
turnover in the housing system.
"To improve the situation, we
have proposed a new lottery sys
tem where on-campus housing as
signments are simultaneously de
cided with off-campus housing
stipends and off-campus subsi
dized apartments."
In the new system, students
would be able rank their prefer
ences and the computer would al
locate those students to their pre
ferred choice.
"At the end of the day, a much
larger fraction of graduate stu
dents would live where they actu-

ally prefer to live and
the number of moves
would be reduced
tremendously" van
Nieuwerburg said.

Rivera and Santos compared
the results to graduate student life
at other universities.
"In most other universities in
the U.S., graduate housing and
health care are considerably
cheaper, often less than half the
price compared to Stanford," San
tos said.
"In comparison to other uni
versities ... it is hard to general
ize, but many students in the sur
vey said that had they known that
they would face such troubles at
Stanford, they would have chosen
to attend M.1.T., Princeton, Cal-
Tech, Harvard, Yale and a few
even said they'd have chosen to at
tend Big Ten schools," Rivera said.
"For example, in UNC-Chapel
Hill a one bedroom apartment in
graduate housing costs $425 per
month. At Stanford it costs $900.
"In the University of Michi
gan, a [doctoral] student with two
children working as a research or
teaching assistant was able to have
health insurance for all his family
for $35 a month. When that stu
dent transferred to Stanford, his
health insurance cost increased to
more than $250 per month."
Rivera also added his own
thoughts on the situation.
"In general I think students
feel that things could be much,
much better — that financial is
sues owing to the cost of living in
Silicon Valley greatly impact [the]
quality of life and the University
should do something to mitigate
these problems" Rivera said.
These recommendations will
form the core of the GSC's plans
for advocacy in the future.
"In the short term, the GSC.
plans to personally share the sur
vey results with the deans of the
schools and with key administra
tors," Rivera said. "From this, we
seek to obtain a consultative role
with the administration, advising
them on student preferences in
regard to access to resources.
"We also aim to become
prominently involved in deci
sion-making processes, owing to
legitimately representing the stu
dent voice, and to the validity of
the data."
Santos also expressed his hope

tha the GSC, in conjunction with
the University, can handle the is
sues raised by the survey.
"We are currently disseminat
ing the survey results and our rec
ommendations to the University
administration and faculty," San
tos said. "We have also created
several task forces within the GSC
to address the most critical issues,
namely stipends level, housing,
health care, child care and trans
portation and parking."

vey results with the deans of the
schools and with key administra
tors," Rivera said. "From this, we
seek to obtain a consultative role
with the administration, advising
them on student preferences in
regard to access to resources.
"We also aim to become
prominently involved in deci
sion-making processes, owing to
legitimately representing the stu
dent voice, and to the validity of
the data."
Santos also expressed his hope

tha the GSC, in conjunction with
the University, can handle the is
sues raised by the survey.
"We are currently disseminat
ing the survey results and our rec
ommendations to the University
administration and faculty," San
tos said. "We have also created
several task forces within the GSC
to address the most critical issues,
namely stipends level, housing,
health care, child care and trans
portation and parking."

The Graduate Student Coun
cil recently released the results of
an online survey on quality-of
life issues for Stanford's graduate
students.
The Web-based survey was im
plemented in November and re
ceived 2091 responses, represent
ing approximately 28 percent of

the graduate-stu
dent population.
"Previous surveys
undertaken by grad
uate student repre-

sentatives in 1998 and 2000 fo
cused predominantly on housing
issues," said Filipe Santos, GSC
chair and a doctoral candidate in
management science and engi
neering. "While the largest compo
nent of this survey is the housing
situation, other aspects of graduate
life — such as graduate students'
overall financial situation, health
care, child care, parking and social
life — were also investigated."
Ray Rivera, a second-year doc
toral candidate in the School of
Education and financial director
of the GSC, discussed the results
of the survey.
"Students feel their quality of
life is greatly compromised by,
first, a labyrinthine process by
which to obtain housing, which
many students report to be ex
tremely disruptive to their stud
ies, and on top of that extremely
offensive; second, the lack of af
fordable heath care — especially
for dependents and children —
with benefits and cost structures
equal to those available from em
ployers if the students were work
ing; third, the extremely high
costs and low availability of child
care, and the general child-un
friendly manner of child care ser
vices and the campus in general;
[and] fourth, the lack of parking
available for off-campus stu
dents," Rivera said.
Stijii van Nieuwerburg a
fourth-year doctoral candidate in
economics and coordinator of the
task force in charge of the survey,
also commented on the results.
"[Graduate students] want sta
bility in their housing situation."
van Nieuwerburg said. "Right now
the current housing system is set up
in such a manner that some stu
dents who prefer to live on campus
live off campus and vice versa.

There is way too much unnecessary
turnover in the housing system.
"To improve the situation, we
have proposed a new lottery sys
tem where on-campus housing as
signments are simultaneously de
cided with off-campus housing
stipends and off-campus subsi
dized apartments."
In the new system, students
would be able rank their prefer
ences and the computer would al
locate those students to their pre
ferred choice.
"At the end of the day, a much
larger fraction of graduate stu
dents would live where they actu-

ally prefer to live and
the number of moves
would be reduced
tremendously" van
Nieuwerburg said.

Rivera and Santos compared
the results to graduate student life
at other universities.
"In most other universities in
the U.S., graduate housing and
health care are considerably
cheaper, often less than half the
price compared to Stanford," San
tos said.
"In comparison to other uni
versities ... it is hard to general
ize, but many students in the sur
vey said that had they known that
they would face such troubles at
Stanford, they would have chosen
to attend M.1.T., Princeton, Cal-
Tech, Harvard, Yale and a few
even said they'd have chosen to at
tend Big Ten schools," Rivera said.
"For example, in UNC-Chapel
Hill a one bedroom apartment in
graduate housing costs $425 per
month. At Stanford it costs $900.
"In the University of Michi
gan, a [doctoral] student with two
children working as a research or
teaching assistant was able to have
health insurance for all his family
for $35 a month. When that stu
dent transferred to Stanford, his
health insurance cost increased to
more than $250 per month."
Rivera also added his own
thoughts on the situation.
"In general I think students
feel that things could be much,
much better — that financial is
sues owing to the cost of living in
Silicon Valley greatly impact [the]
quality of life and the University
should do something to mitigate
these problems" Rivera said.
These recommendations will
form the core of the GSC's plans
for advocacy in the future.

vey results with the deans of the

tors," Rivera said. "From this, we
