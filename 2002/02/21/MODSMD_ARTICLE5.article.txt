### NAEL FAKHRY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 2002 California Democratic Convention —
considered by party officials to be the most significant
Democratic gathering of the year — was held Feb. 16
and Feb. 17 in Los Angeles. The event was notable for
its strong showing of Stanford students, alumni and
former Graduate School of Business Prof. Steve West
ly, who is running for state controller.
Juniors David Roeske, Michael Osofsky and
freshman Alex Bradford attended the Convention
as delegates supporting VVestly, who was an under
graduate at Stanford and also graduated from the
Business School.
The three students became delegates by regularly
attending Santa Clara County Committee meetings
in recent months. They were then sponsored to be on
the Santa Clara Democratic Committee and voted
onto the California Democratic Control Committee.
The three were selected to attend the California
Democratic Convention in Los Angeles as alternates
for three members who were unable to attend.
"The control committee had an enormous amount

of respect for us as the youngest
voting members, because it nor
mally is the oldest and most senior
supporters who are in atten
dance," Osofsky said.
The convention was held to
endorse candidates for the pri
mary election in March and Del
egates attend the Convention to
lend support for their candi
dates. Ten thousand politicians,
delegates and supporters were
in attendance.

Among the attendees were Sen
ator Barbara Boxer, Gov. Gray
Davis — both of whom are Stan
ford alnmni — and Senators John
Kerry (I)-MA), Tom Daschle (D
-SD) and John Edwards (D-NC), all
three of whom are 2004 presiden
tial hopefuls.
Although none of these politi
cians is currently running for of
fice, some delivered speeches and
lent support to the Democratic
party as a whole in order to make
their presence known.
The three most closely watched
and highly contested positions at
the convention, according to Os
ofsky, were for state controller,

secretary of state and insurance
commissioner.
"As college students . . . this
was a huge experience simply be
cause we are so young, but we
were afforded the opportunity to
make an actual impact on the po
litical scene," Bradford said.
"For me, it was an unprece
dented, amazing experience to
meet the country's top politicians
and leaders," Osofsky said.
Westly hoped to be nominated
as state controller at the conven
tion and ultimately earned the
majority vote. Next he will go to
the March 5 primary.
According to Bradford, Westly

credits Stanford students for his
majority vote at the convention.
"[We] played a unique role by
adding youth and enthusiasm,"
Bradford said.
Westly, formerly senior vice
president of eßay, also received
support from the Stanford De
mocrats who attended the Con
vention, and a host of other Stan
ford community members, in
cluding his Northern California
Campaign Manager Steven Ara
nowitz, a Stanford alumnus.
"We went crazy for the Westly
campaign . . . and talked to nearly
every delegate in line to support
[Westly]," Roeske said.
