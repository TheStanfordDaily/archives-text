# ASSU discusses SLAC, Latin American Studies
## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate stressed the need for better stu
dent-administration communica
tion at its meeting Tuesday night.
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
members explained the group's ac
tions at the Feb. 12 question-and
answer session with University Pres
ident John Hennessy.
"Some of the things you do, be
cause of our endorsement [of the
coalition's campaign], reflects on
us," said Senate Chair Alex Shvarts
man, a senior.
"We really want to apologize for
last Tuesday," said coalition mem
ber Meghana Reddy, a junior.

" In no way do we mean to jeop
ardize student groups."
She said that at a meeting with
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni, coalition represen
tatives "clearly communicated" that
the ASSU was not involved with the
coalition's actions Feb. 12.
"We can't alienate ourselves
from you or from the bigger cause
of labor justice," said coalition mem
ber Kuusela Hilo, a junior.
The coalition's transformation of
a question for Hennessy into a Hen
nessy-coalition debate was spurred,
Reddy said, by the group's frustra
tion over recent administrative deci
sions. She specifically noted Hen
nessy's proclamation at a recent Fac
ulty Senate meeting that a living

ASSOCIATED STUDENTS Of STANFORD UNIVERSITY
wage of $10.10 per hour would be
set for non-union workers.
According to Reddy, many
students were confused by the
coalition's outrage because it
seemed that the coalition's de
mands were met.
"It was practically absolutely
the opposite of what we wanted,"
she said.
In addition to failing to provide a
University code of conduct towards
workers, this decision was made
without student or worker input,
Reddy said. According to her they

had been assured that both parties
would be allowed to contribute to
the decision.
"[The administration] went
back on their promise," Reddy
said. "These were verbal agree
ments that we trusted ... and they
were violated."
"We were working together in
this process," Hilo said. "All of a sud
den, we weren't working together
anymore? They refuse to have
meetings with workers and unions.
That's the direct point of the cam
paign. We're going to keep request
ing for meetings."
"Sometimes," Reddy said, "you
do have to confront people on

these issues. Otherwise change will
never happen."
However, Senior Assistant to the
President Jeff Wachtel said that
student input had factored into
Hennessy's living wage decision.
He also said that the administra
tion will continue to meet with stu
dents and union workers, but not
as a collective group.
" Hie University continues to be
very interested in meeting with the
students," Wachtel said. "We think
there's a separate and available place
for unions to meet [with die admin
istration] if they have problems."
The University has never had a
policy of meeting with student and
workers simultaneously, Wachtel
said, noting that workers unexpect
edly appeared at one meeting be
tween students and administrators.
The workers were allowed to attend
rather than rescheduling the meet
ing.
"We were surprised they were

there," Wachtel said.
He said he thought the admin
istration had attempted to clarify
that union workers would not be
allowed in administration-stu
dent meetings.
"When it comes to unions,
there's a specific set of rules and
guidelines ... for how we address
those sort of problems," he said.
According to Wachtel, union
workers could not negotiate on be
half of non-union workers.
"Their interests may not be the
same," Wachtel said.
Senate Associate Dan Wend
landt, a freshman, said the coali
tion had the Senate's' support and
expressed his hope that this
would continue.
"We would appreciate it if the
lines of communication are left very
open," he said.
"This is the first time I know the
Senate has begun to take political
stances," Senator Sonrisa Lucero, a
junior, said. "This is really impor
tant. This is our job, to bring student
voices to the
administration ... we're going in
the right direction.

The Senate also passed another
resolution Tuesday calling for
greater communication between
students and administrators re
garding University decisions. The
bill was prompted by the recent de
cision not to renew the interdiscipli
nary program in Latin American
Studies. Advocacy Committee Co-
Chair Ximena Martinez, a junior,
introduced the document, which
called for "administration account
ability and transparency."
Students — except fora few ap
pointed to University commit
tees — Martinez and the bill noted,
weren't notified that the program
was up for review, nor were unde
clared students given enough be
fore the bachelor's and master's
programs were terminated.
"The purpose of the bill is to
get students more intimately in
volved in the decision," said se
nior Julia Click, an Latin Ameri
can Studies major who attended
the Senate meeting.
She noted the irony of the ad
ministration's having a procedure
for terminating a major but no pro
cedure for notifying the students

within it.
The program will still be discon
tinued, but senators expressed
hope that the bill will prompt ad
ministrators to solicit student input
on future decisions direcdy affect
ing student majors.
"There is going to be some tan
gible follow-up to this, even if it [is
not] directly to LAS," said Stu
dent Life Chair Nick Rodriguez,
a sophomore.
"We're trying to codify a way in
which students can provide input,"
Martinez said. "We do want to help
out, we do want to increase com
munication ... the biggest goal is
just to show our support to stu
dents," Martinez said.
The resolution will be sent to var
ious deans, including Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Sharon Long.
On funding, the Senate debated
the idea of requiring special fee
seeking groups to subsidize part of
their special fee requests with their
own reserve funds. The issue will be
debated further at the appropria
tions committee meeting tomorrow
and at Tuesday's Senate meeting.

man, a senior.
"We really want to apologize for
last Tuesday," said coalition mem
ber Meghana Reddy, a junior.

" In no way do we mean to jeop
ardize student groups."
She said that at a meeting with
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni, coalition represen
tatives "clearly communicated" that
the ASSU was not involved with the
coalition's actions Feb. 12.
"We can't alienate ourselves
from you or from the bigger cause
of labor justice," said coalition mem
ber Kuusela Hilo, a junior.
The coalition's transformation of
a question for Hennessy into a Hen
nessy-coalition debate was spurred,
Reddy said, by the group's frustra
tion over recent administrative deci
sions. She specifically noted Hen
nessy's proclamation at a recent Fac
ulty Senate meeting that a living

ASSOCIATED STUDENTS Of STANFORD UNIVERSITY
wage of $10.10 per hour would be
set for non-union workers.
According to Reddy, many
students were confused by the
coalition's outrage because it
seemed that the coalition's de
mands were met.
"It was practically absolutely
the opposite of what we wanted,"
she said.
In addition to failing to provide a
University code of conduct towards
workers, this decision was made
without student or worker input,
Reddy said. According to her they

had been assured that both parties
would be allowed to contribute to
the decision.
"[The administration] went
back on their promise," Reddy
said. "These were verbal agree
ments that we trusted ... and they
were violated."
"We were working together in
this process," Hilo said. "All of a sud
den, we weren't working together
anymore? They refuse to have
meetings with workers and unions.
That's the direct point of the cam
paign. We're going to keep request
ing for meetings."
"Sometimes," Reddy said, "you
do have to confront people on

these issues. Otherwise change will
never happen."
However, Senior Assistant to the
President Jeff Wachtel said that
student input had factored into
Hennessy's living wage decision.
He also said that the administra
tion will continue to meet with stu
dents and union workers, but not
as a collective group.
" Hie University continues to be
very interested in meeting with the
students," Wachtel said. "We think
there's a separate and available place
for unions to meet [with die admin
istration] if they have problems."
The University has never had a
policy of meeting with student and
workers simultaneously, Wachtel
said, noting that workers unexpect
edly appeared at one meeting be
tween students and administrators.
The workers were allowed to attend
rather than rescheduling the meet
ing.
"We were surprised they were

there," Wachtel said.
He said he thought the admin
istration had attempted to clarify
that union workers would not be
allowed in administration-stu
dent meetings.
"When it comes to unions,
there's a specific set of rules and
guidelines ... for how we address
those sort of problems," he said.
According to Wachtel, union
workers could not negotiate on be
half of non-union workers.
"Their interests may not be the
same," Wachtel said.
Senate Associate Dan Wend
landt, a freshman, said the coali
tion had the Senate's' support and
expressed his hope that this
would continue.
"We would appreciate it if the
lines of communication are left very
open," he said.
"This is the first time I know the
Senate has begun to take political
stances," Senator Sonrisa Lucero, a
junior, said. "This is really impor
tant. This is our job, to bring student
voices to the
administration ... we're going in
the right direction.

The Senate also passed another
resolution Tuesday calling for
greater communication between
students and administrators re
garding University decisions. The
bill was prompted by the recent de
cision not to renew the interdiscipli
nary program in Latin American
Studies. Advocacy Committee Co-
Chair Ximena Martinez, a junior,
introduced the document, which
called for "administration account
ability and transparency."
Students — except fora few ap
pointed to University commit
tees — Martinez and the bill noted,
weren't notified that the program
was up for review, nor were unde
clared students given enough be
fore the bachelor's and master's
programs were terminated.
"The purpose of the bill is to
get students more intimately in
volved in the decision," said se
nior Julia Click, an Latin Ameri
can Studies major who attended
the Senate meeting.
She noted the irony of the ad
ministration's having a procedure
for terminating a major but no pro
cedure for notifying the students

within it.
The program will still be discon
tinued, but senators expressed
hope that the bill will prompt ad
ministrators to solicit student input
on future decisions direcdy affect
ing student majors.
"There is going to be some tan
gible follow-up to this, even if it [is
not] directly to LAS," said Stu
dent Life Chair Nick Rodriguez,
a sophomore.
"We're trying to codify a way in
which students can provide input,"
Martinez said. "We do want to help
out, we do want to increase com
munication ... the biggest goal is
just to show our support to stu
dents," Martinez said.
The resolution will be sent to var
ious deans, including Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Sharon Long.
On funding, the Senate debated
the idea of requiring special fee
seeking groups to subsidize part of
their special fee requests with their
own reserve funds. The issue will be
debated further at the appropria
tions committee meeting tomorrow
and at Tuesday's Senate meeting.
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate stressed the need for better stu
dent-administration communica
tion at its meeting Tuesday night.
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
members explained the group's ac
tions at the Feb. 12 question-and
answer session with University Pres
ident John Hennessy.
"Some of the things you do, be
cause of our endorsement [of the
coalition's campaign], reflects on
