The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate stressed the need for better stu
dent-administration communica
tion at its meeting Tuesday night.
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
members explained the group's ac
tions at the Feb. 12 question-and
answer session with University Pres
ident John Hennessy.
"Some of the things you do, be
cause of our endorsement [of the
coalition's campaign], reflects on
us," said Senate Chair Alex Shvarts
man, a senior.
"We really want to apologize for
last Tuesday," said coalition mem

" In no way do we mean to jeop

she said.
In addition to failing to provide a
University code of conduct towards
workers, this decision was made
without student or worker input,
Reddy said. According to her they

had been assured that both parties
would be allowed to contribute to
the decision.
"[The administration] went
back on their promise," Reddy
said. "These were verbal agree
ments that we trusted ... and they
were violated."
"We were working together in
this process," Hilo said. "All of a sud
den, we weren't working together
anymore? They refuse to have
meetings with workers and unions.
That's the direct point of the cam

"Sometimes," Reddy said, "you
