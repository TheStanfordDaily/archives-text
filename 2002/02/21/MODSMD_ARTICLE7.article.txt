### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Meeting Services, which schedules 200 to 400
campus events per month, has revamped its
Web site to allow users to make meeting room
reservations online.
The new Web site allows users to fill out room
request forms that are automatically sent to the
service's office for processing, explained Eliza
beth Pope, Meeting Services coordinator. With
in two business days, Meeting Services replies t
with availability information.
Prior to the new site's debut in January,
clients could download room request forms, but
had to bring or fax the form to the Meeting Ser
vices office.

"[The online form] allows a more time-effi
cient way for students and departments to plan
their events," Pope said. "The site will aid groups
planning events by [because they will be] able to
access the information from their dorm room,
instead of our office."
"The primary goal is to keep costs down for
students and make [the process] easy," said
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of Meeting
Services.
also commented on the need to
revamp the Web site.
The renovation oft he site was in response to
user feedback, the employment of permanent
staff and the need to "make services easily ac
cessible by catching up with the times," Smith-
Laws said.

Also, the new Web site is a part of a larger
scheme of improvements "in the evolution of
Meeting Services," she said.
According to Smith-Laws, future improve
ments, such as tapping into the Registrar's office,
will make the system "more user-friendly."
"Ultimately people will be able to simply see a
day and book a room," she said.
To date, the Web site has run smoothly, ac
cording to Meeting Services.
"[The site] hasn't had any problems so far,"
Smith-Laws said. " The biggest problem was sim
ply finding someone to keep the site updated."
This arises because employed students are
not permanent.
Jessy Rang, a graduate student,
worked with Pope and Smith-Laws
as the webmaster.
"He has done an extraordinary
job with the site," Smith-Laws said.
The Web site initially cost $ 1,500

to create and Smith-Laws estimated
that it cost around $2,000 to revamp.
She said the cost was worthwhile.
" People can access forms and get
information ahead of time ... and
it is also a step towards the long
range goal," she said.
Smith-Laws said she hoped stu
dents would be encouraged to ac
cess the Web site at www.stan
fotd.edu/group/tms.
