# And the band played on 'Dead Tongues' alive and well
## Two faculty members discuss experiences in music group 
### KOK-TONG KHOO 
While last weekend's Phi Psi
Battle of the Bands proved that
student gigs are alive and well
(or at least alive), lesser known is
the existence of similar faculty
acts. One such endeavor, Dead
Tongues, might initially pro
voke thoughts of poor palates.
In reality, the band Dead
Tongues was first formed in the
early 1980s by Linguistics Pro
fessors Geoff Nunberg and
Ivan Sag.
"There was a faculty talent
show at Tresidder and we said,
what the heck, let's get a band to
gether," Sag said. "We had a con
test in the Linguistics Depart
ment to find a name. DTs won."
That was not the first time
Ivan Sag had been in a band
named after its members' life
experiences. At the age of 13,
he formed his first group,
which lasted all of one gig. Ac
cording to his prep school's stu
dent newspaper," Ivan and the
Terribles' literally lived up to
their name.
Sag looks back on his first
foray with clinical honesty:
"We sucked," he said.
However, his gig-playing for
tunes improved when his third
band beat the established best
outfit in a senior year battle of
the bands, an achievement he
deemed "one of the most mo
mentous events in my prep
school career."
That momentum carried
him through different bands in
his academic career, as well as a
stint in concert production. He
started out producing blues

concerts while on the arts com
mittee of the University of
Rochester, meeting celebrities
like Muddy Waters and Howlin
Wolf in the process.
After dropping in and out of
college to play in a rock band
fora brief period, his musical
career culminated in a concert
that featured Ike and Tina
Turner. Unfortunately for
him, concert profiteering was
not his forte.
"It was a financial bomb, and
[in deciding to go to graduate
school] I thought academics was
something I was going to have a
better shot at," Sag said.
As it turns out, he was able
to continue his love for play
ing gigs with the people he
met in academia. Aside from
Nunberg and himself, Peter
Sells and James Ferrell, lin
guistics and medical school
professors, respectively, have
been instrumental in the
band's development.
Ferrell first joined the band
about 15 years ago, while he was
still a graduate student here.
His musical influences read like
a who's who of rock, ranging
from The Beatles andjimi Hen
drix to REMand Nirvana. He is
no stranger to bands himself,
having played in Stanford
bands such as Rooftop Magic
and The Druids.
Asked for his advice to bud
ding musicians at Stanford, Fer
rell mused, "Chuck's Donuts on
Woodside Road is an outstand
ing all-night donut shop. But
please, no more than one apple
fritter per band member."
Sells, who joined the band in
1984, claims to have had "the
musical interests of a British 19-
year-old for the past 25 years."
"If you are serious about try
ing to make money, being able
to sight-read is a real must in

order tor you to get paid jobs,"
Sells said.
Sag's advice for would-be
musicians reflects his erratic ex
periences.
"Don't close off your options.
I dropped out of college to play
in a rock Sand and it didn't take
me long to know it was the
wrong decision," Sag said.
He also feels he went
through school too fast, going
straight from college to a PhD
program. Although he loves
teaching and research, he
urges students to get more life
experience.
"The students who've
thought about it make better
grad students. More dedication,
fewer conflicts," he said.
Presently, the band mem
bers' busy schedules restrict
them to annual performances.
Their last party was in June
2001 with a roster staffed by vet
erans, alumni and students.
The band's profile has seen
numerous changes over the
past 20 years, with at least half a
dozen lead singers, each one
bringing fresh ideas. As such,
their music also varies, includ
ing genres like blues and rock.
This constant influx of new
blood appears to be the most vi
able way of keeping Dead
Tongues alive. Sag conducts re
cruitment drives ahead of up
coming acts, using a combina
tion of e-mails and first-day-of
class questionnaires that read,
"name, e-mail, year and do you
play the drums?"
Whether this will lead to the
band's long-term survival re
mains to be seen. When asked
where he sees the band headed
in the future, Ferrell quipped,
"maybe Ivan's garage." Hope
fully, the ghost of Ivan and the
Terribles will spare Dead
Tongues an initiation in deja vu.
Indeed, prep school held
even more momentous lile expe
rience for Sag than his music,
when he was expelled two
months alter winning that battle
of the bands. He and a bunch of
friends had been drinking on a
field trip, instead of going to see
a French play.
In spite of the humbling ex
perience, he still believes that

the school's zero-tolerance poli
cy is repressive.
"Kids that age need some un
derstanding, and secondary
schools of all kinds need to realize
that," Sag said.
For now, faculty and students'
shared interest in music might
just bridge some divides and si
multaneously keep Dead
Tongues wagging. Sag remi
nisced about '80s gigs at Phi Psi
and co-op parties:
"Music is a great equalizer.
You can have a good time jam
ming with people who are a lot
older or younger than you," he
said.

[in deciding to go to graduate
school] I thought academics was
something I was going to have a
better shot at," Sag said.
As it turns out, he was able
to continue his love for play
ing gigs with the people he
met in academia. Aside from
Nunberg and himself, Peter
Sells and James Ferrell, lin
guistics and medical school
professors, respectively, have
been instrumental in the
band's development.
Ferrell first joined the band
about 15 years ago, while he was
still a graduate student here.
His musical influences read like
a who's who of rock, ranging
from The Beatles andjimi Hen
drix to REMand Nirvana. He is
no stranger to bands himself,
having played in Stanford
bands such as Rooftop Magic
and The Druids.
Asked for his advice to bud
ding musicians at Stanford, Fer
rell mused, "Chuck's Donuts on
Woodside Road is an outstand
ing all-night donut shop. But
please, no more than one apple
fritter per band member."
Sells, who joined the band in
1984, claims to have had "the
musical interests of a British 19-
year-old for the past 25 years."
"If you are serious about try
ing to make money, being able
to sight-read is a real must in

order tor you to get paid jobs,"
Sells said.
Sag's advice for would-be
musicians reflects his erratic ex
periences.
"Don't close off your options.
I dropped out of college to play
in a rock Sand and it didn't take
me long to know it was the
wrong decision," Sag said.
He also feels he went
through school too fast, going
straight from college to a PhD
program. Although he loves
teaching and research, he
urges students to get more life
experience.
"The students who've
thought about it make better
grad students. More dedication,
fewer conflicts," he said.
Presently, the band mem
bers' busy schedules restrict
them to annual performances.
Their last party was in June
2001 with a roster staffed by vet
erans, alumni and students.
The band's profile has seen
numerous changes over the
past 20 years, with at least half a
dozen lead singers, each one
bringing fresh ideas. As such,
their music also varies, includ
ing genres like blues and rock.
This constant influx of new
blood appears to be the most vi
able way of keeping Dead
Tongues alive. Sag conducts re
cruitment drives ahead of up
coming acts, using a combina
tion of e-mails and first-day-of
class questionnaires that read,
"name, e-mail, year and do you
play the drums?"
Whether this will lead to the
band's long-term survival re
mains to be seen. When asked
where he sees the band headed
in the future, Ferrell quipped,
"maybe Ivan's garage." Hope
fully, the ghost of Ivan and the
Terribles will spare Dead
Tongues an initiation in deja vu.
Indeed, prep school held
even more momentous lile expe
rience for Sag than his music,
when he was expelled two
months alter winning that battle
of the bands. He and a bunch of
friends had been drinking on a
field trip, instead of going to see
a French play.
In spite of the humbling ex
perience, he still believes that

the school's zero-tolerance poli
cy is repressive.
"Kids that age need some un
derstanding, and secondary
schools of all kinds need to realize
that," Sag said.
For now, faculty and students'
shared interest in music might
just bridge some divides and si
multaneously keep Dead
Tongues wagging. Sag remi
nisced about '80s gigs at Phi Psi
and co-op parties:
"Music is a great equalizer.
You can have a good time jam
ming with people who are a lot
older or younger than you," he
said.
While last weekend's Phi Psi
Battle of the Bands proved that
student gigs are alive and well
(or at least alive), lesser known is
the existence of similar faculty
acts. One such endeavor, Dead
Tongues, might initially pro
voke thoughts of poor palates.
In reality, the band Dead
Tongues was first formed in the
early 1980s by Linguistics Pro
fessors Geoff Nunberg and
Ivan Sag.
"There was a faculty talent
show at Tresidder and we said,
what the heck, let's get a band to
gether," Sag said. "We had a con
test in the Linguistics Depart
ment to find a name. DTs won."
That was not the first time
Ivan Sag had been in a band
named after its members' life
experiences. At the age of 13,
he formed his first group,
which lasted all of one gig. Ac
cording to his prep school's stu
dent newspaper," Ivan and the
Terribles' literally lived up to
their name.
Sag looks back on his first
foray with clinical honesty:
"We sucked," he said.
However, his gig-playing for
tunes improved when his third
band beat the established best
outfit in a senior year battle of
the bands, an achievement he
deemed "one of the most mo
mentous events in my prep
school career."
That momentum carried
him through different bands in
his academic career, as well as a
stint in concert production. He
started out producing blues

concerts while on the arts com
mittee of the University of
Rochester, meeting celebrities
like Muddy Waters and Howlin
Wolf in the process.
After dropping in and out of
college to play in a rock band
fora brief period, his musical
career culminated in a concert
that featured Ike and Tina
Turner. Unfortunately for
him, concert profiteering was
not his forte.
"It was a financial bomb, and
[in deciding to go to graduate
school] I thought academics was
something I was going to have a
better shot at," Sag said.
