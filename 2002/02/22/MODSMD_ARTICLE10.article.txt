# Researcher designs program for genes
## 
### VICTOR REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford researcher Jonathan
Usuka has recently developed a
computer program, "Digital Dis
ease," that might help scientists
quickly identify the genes in
volved in diseases and addictions
including diabetes, osteoporosis
and alcoholism.
The software compares dis
ease data with genetic data and
then suggests which genes
might be involved in the dis
ease. It currently searches only
the mouse genome, but since
mice are genetically 80 percent
identical to humans, the soft
ware's conclusions also apply to
humans.
Scientists work with mice in
stead of humans because they
are genetic ally less diverse, mak
ing it easier for researchers
around the world to conduct re
producible experiments and
compare results, Usuka said.
"If you identify disease genes
in the mouse, it's pretty straight
forward to find that same gene in
a human," Usuka said.
Digital Disease can reduce
the time spent on genetic
analysis work from months to
milliseconds.
Present-clay laboratory

methods for determining traits
such as susceptibility to cocaine
addiction usually cost millions
of dollars, involve hundreds of
inbred lab mice and take
months or years to complete,
according to Usuka.
When Usuka — looking fora
dissertation project — found
himselffrustrated by this lengthy
process, he thought of compar
ing data from disease and addic
tion studies with genetic data
that was already archived.
"II we could do that, then that
might be a very quick, cheap, ef
ficient way of finding out where
disease genes might be located,"
Usuka said.
Usuka and his colleagues at
the Roche pharmaceutical

company in Palo Alto carried out
this idea, resulting in the creation
of the program. Usuka presented
the project for his doctorate in
chemistry, which he received last
June.
The program has been accu
rate in identifying potentially
harmful instances where diller
ences from the average genome
occur, called single nucleotide
polymorphisms. Many are harm
less, but others are linked to seri
ous diseases and addictions.
"We have a couple of things in

the works right now that, when
they are finished, are going to
make quite a splash," Usuka said.
He hopes to publish more research
results this year.
"That will be the proof of this
software, when we can actually say,
'Here is the gene or set of genes
that do this thing, this addiction or
disease,'" Usuka said.
A demo vei"sion of the database is
available at http://mouseSNP.

Usuka will speak at the genetics
department on March 1 about Dig
ital Disease and other research in
terests. The event will be called
"Approaches to in silico genetics:
interpretations of a SNl' database,"
and will take place at 2:15 p.m.
