Fpr most computer programmers, the
result of finishing a program is receiving
a grade and another assignment. Howev
er, those who are participating in the
2002 Sun Microsystems and Top Coder
Collegiate Challenge have the opportu
nity to win $100,000.
fhe tournament began Tuesday night,
when Top Coder announced its field of in
vitees— 512 of the highest-rated Top-
Coder college-level members — and
began a series of four online regional tour

naments. The winners of these tourna
ments receive $5,000 and automatically
advances to the final round of 16 coders.
The 16 go to M.I.T. to participate in
the semifinal and championship rounds
on April 19 and April 20. The tournament
champion will receive $100,000.
According to tournament organizers,
competitors have to code quickly and accu
rately in a particular coding language to be
successful. Winners are the fastest to solve
problems with computer code that with
stands the scrutiny of other contestants, as
well as theTopCoder system itself.
The tournament marks Top Coder's

second annual Collegiate Challenge and
the third major programming tourna
ment in its history. Last year's Collegiate
(Challenge was won by Jason Woolever, an
M.I.T. graduate student.
Stanford traditionally has a strong
Computer Science department, as
shown by the fact that 20 students have
been invited to participate in this year's
challenge. In fact, the highest rated
member entering the tournament is ju

nior Jon McAlister, who is ranked first in
the West region and was the runner-up
in last year's Collegiate Challenge.
Top Coder isn't just about money, how
ever. By rating different students as pro
grammers, the company provides em
ployers with a way to compare different
students as potential employees.
"Each year a new class of graduates en
ters the [information technology] work
force," said Jack Hughes, Top Coder
chairman and founder. "Top Coder com
petitions enable technology companies
and recruiters to identify and objectively
assess candidates through testing and rat

ing coding skills under real-world condi
tions. Top Coder offers services to assist
companies looking to hire top program
ming talent."
Hughes encouraged Stanford students
to participate.
"I would like to wish the students of
Stanford the best of luck in this year's Col
legiate Challenge," he said. "The number
of Stanford competitors is a direct reflection
of the talent and coding skills of the Stan
ford student body and the teaching and
mentoring of the distinguished faculty."
