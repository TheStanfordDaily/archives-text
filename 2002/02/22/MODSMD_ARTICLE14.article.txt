# Answer Girl jumps to some conclusions

S: Answer Girl, have you been watching
the Olympics lately? Some of those
events are incredible. But really, the ath
letes in the ski jumping competitions must
be crazy. It looks so dangerous to me. How
do they jump so far and so high?
A: I think they're probably all a bit insane,
because ski jumping is a very dangerous
sport. At speeds over 60 miles per hour, the
skier literally dives off a cliff, soars through the
air and finally descends back to earth about
328 feet from takeoff. Even though they make
it look easy, there is a lot that goes on behind
one jump.
Like a roller coaster, all the energy fora
jump comes from gravitational potential ener
gy acquired by going to the top of the inrun.
Coming down the inrun, jumpers try to build
up as much speed as possible while still main
taining control. To minimize air resistance,
they get in a low crouch, point their arms for
ward, and bend their heads slightly downward
like a diver entering the water.

Halfway down the inrun, jumpers begin to
re-position their bodies to prepare lor the leap.
Near the end, where the inrun begins to curve
upward like a ramp, they raise their hips slight
ly while pressing the chest tight against the
knees. This makes the legs act like a coiled
spring, storing additional energy for the take
off. About 10 feet from the end of the inrun,
jumpers begin their final adjustments before
takeoff, bringing their arms perpendicular to
the ground and rising up slightly.
The most important part of the jump occurs
at takeoff. Within a tenth of a second, jumpers
must combine two motions at once, leaping
both forward and upward at the same time.
The timing of the takeoff leap is what makes or
breaks a jump. If jumpers spring before they
reach the exact end of the takeoff'table, their
skis will point down, causing extra wind resis
tance, which results in a short jump. If they
spring too late, their skis are pointed too high,
resulting in a serious loss of control.
In the air, jumpers become Hying projec
tiles, using their bodies and skis like a giant air
foil. They lean forward, producing a positive
angle of attack on the wind. Traditionally,
jumpers always keep their skis straight in line

with their bodies to lessen air resistance and
reduce drag. In 1989, a jumper revolution
ized jumping by holding his skis in a large V
with the open end pointed forward. This posi
tioning increases the surface area below the
body, providing more lift toward (he end of
the flight. It extends the time in the air and the
distance of the jump.
If you want to learn more, check with the
International Olympic Committee in the near
future. Its Medical Commission just an
nounced two studies that they are conducting
in Salt Lake City. One looks to discover what a
skier's optimal flight trajectory at takeoff will
have to be to jump the greatest distance. The
other hopes to develop skis for heavier ath
letes that put them on equal footing with their
lighter opponents, so weight does not become
a serious issue.
