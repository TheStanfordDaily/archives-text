## The 						Stanford Daily Parents' Weekend should foster two-way dialogue 
### 
Published Since JB9l

Today the University officially wel
comes some 3000 mothers, fathers
and other family members for Par
ents' Weekend 2002. This annual two-day
gathering is an excellent tradition — stu
dents have the opportunity to share with
their parents a bit of the daily routine of Stan
ford life, albeit in stylized form.
Parents can tour the campus, eat in the
dorms and even attend mini-lectures. Parents'
Weekend should do more, however, than
merely dazzle those who pay the tuition bills.
Ideally, these next three days ought to func
tion not as a one-way monologue on the sub
ject of Stanford's greatness delivered by the
University to diffident parents, but rather as a
conversation between parents, students and
the academic community at large about the fu
ture of Stanford.
The University faces a host of challenging

issues in the coming decade that, taken to
gether, could profoundly affect Stanford's
core identity.
The intersection of biomedical science and
ethics is perhaps the most pressing example.
Stanford alumnus Jim Clark's decision to
protest federal limits on stem-cell research by
withdrawing a portion of his $150 million do
nation to the University's biomedical research
center foreshadows an important debate to
come: will Stanford conduct so-called "thera
peutic cloning?"
More broadly, how will the University bal
ance the promises of science with the demands
of ethics? And how will undergraduates be
taught to approach scientific pursuits while con
sidering their social and moral implications?
There are other less contentious, though
no less significant, issues. The future of Stan
ford's interdisciplinary programs, particu

larly area studies like the American and Latin
American Studies curriculums; the place of
language studies at Stanford; the design of
the General Education Requirements follow
ing their upcoming review — all these mat
ters are forms of the same question. What
sort of University will Stanford be, and what
sort of student will Stanford produce in its
second century?
Parents have a vital perspective in this dis
cussion about the University's future. They
live, work and support families in the real
world; they are, for the most part, intimately
familiar with the tasks and duties of life beyond
college campuses. They can contribute in
formed judgments about how students should
be equipped to thrive in the workplace, in the
public sector and in service to others.
Even more significantly, parents' ideas
about the goals of higher education and their

expectations for their children deeply influ
ence student attitudes about academic pur
suits. As the University teaches parents this
weekend about life at Stanford, parents
should talk with students about their mutual
expectations for undergraduate study and
life beyond.
Parents should also use these two days as an
opportunity to become better acquainted with
the challenges and opportunities awaiting
Stanford, and they should discuss the conse
quences of these issues with their daughters
and sons.
The University, for its part, should develop
new and creative ways to gather parents' input
and bring them into the conversation about
undergraduate education. Parents are critical
members of the Stanford community, and
they, no less than faculty and students, have a
stake in its future.
