## Branding America 
### 
Public relations firms, marketing
agencies and organs of propaganda
don't have very good reputations.
Which is ironic, given that they're sup
posed to be able to shape public opinion.
Regardless, virtually every celebrity, cor
poration and country uses one form o f pro
fessional opinion manipulation or another.
Since Sept. 11, (lie U.S. government
has paid special attention to getting the

American perspective
out across the world.
"Winning the battle for
hearts and minds," they
call it. Caught unpre
pared by early instances
where foreign news —
and the Arab al [azeera
network in particular —
seemed to favor Osama

bin Laden's perspective over America's,
the government launched a P.R. counter
offensive.
There are two '/pes of propaganda:
true and false.
The true type emphasizes facts that sup
port a certain point of view, albeit perhaps
at the expense of other facts. It gets the
word out on particular ideas and makes the
case for particular beliefs.
lake as an example television car com
mercials that dwell on acceleration and
agility without mentioning a poor mainte
nance record.
The second type of propaganda is the
type which really gives propaganda its bad
name. It is patently false and perfidious in
the highest. Think (lull of Tonkin.
()n the true side of things, one of the first
steps the government took in its P.R. offen
sive was the establishment of an Office of
Strategic Influence within the Department
of Defense.
Among the office's duties was countering
assertions by the Taliban that airdropped
American food was poisoned or contained
ingredients forbidden by Islam, as well as re
futing foreign casualty counts.
The Rendon Group — a consulting
firm which has done work for George
Washington University, the CIA and the
1996 Riddick Howe-Andrew Golota fight,
among others — was hired to aid them. A
daily war-room meeting was instituted to
coordinate its message.
Another step, and another novel use
of industry experience by the govern
ment, was the recruitment of advertising
executive Charlotte Beers to be under
secretary of state for public diplomacy
and public affairs. She has talked about
"branding America."
1 don't usually think of my home as hav
ing a brand, but I guess it makes sense.
America™ must be the high-quality, lux
ury model. Or the brand that's high in lat
but tastes great.
Undersecretary Beers puts it a little dif
ferently. She says the l\R. situation Ameri
ca faces "is not unlike, say, IBM, which was
considered to be big. powerful and arro
gant," barkening back to the $500 million

IBM account she handled as a public rela
tions company C.E.O. She sees greater
communication as the key to winning the
psychological battle and has fielded "typical
consumer research" in the Middle East,
using "private research, marketing and
strategy firms."
If these firms are the same ones that
drive our consumer habits over here, then
al Qaeda better watch out.
We're unleashing our secret weapon:
the marketers.
So that, along with the thousands of
fliers dropped over Afghanistan — some
quite graphic — constitute what the gov
ernment would call the true part of our
propaganda offensive.
This past week, The New York Times
reported on the possibility of greatly ex
panded false propaganda.
They reported that the Pentagon was
formulating plans to furnish news items,
both true and untrue, to foreign news or
ganizations. The Office of Strategic Influ
ence would expand its purview to friend
ly nations in Europe and Asia. Military
propaganda would be sent to foreign
media and decision-makers disguised as
correspondence from independent enti
ties.
Essentially, the plan would actually set
forth as policy what some already suspect,
but are branded as paranoid for suspecting.
It would be akin to the type of presidential
ly sanctioned covert CIA operations of past
decades that aimed to undermine certain
governments.
It's just not a good idea. As Norman
Schwarzkopf said on the reported plans,
"We don't deliberately lie to other peo
ple. .. That's not America. That's not what
we do."
Fortunately, Secretary of Defense Don
ald Rumsfeld later denied that his depart
ment would go around lying, except to the
enemy to gain tactical military advantage.
He also said that the Pentagon would not
give disinformation to either domestic or
foreign press. That's good to hear, if we can
believe it.
And that's the problem with the plan.
Once we know that our government is de
liberately spreading falsehood, we can't
trust anything they say.
And if even we can't trust what they're
saying, how can we expect the rest of the
world to trust them? The country has t<x»
little credibility already to squander.
And what's the reason for lying, anyway?
If the government doesn't think the truth is
enough to explain its actions to the world,
then there is something wrong with what
we're doing.
In the past, America worked to be
seen by the free world as a trustworthy,
open power.
Its greatest propaganda weapon was its
example. And the public relations firms
should lx' able to do just fine with that truth.
