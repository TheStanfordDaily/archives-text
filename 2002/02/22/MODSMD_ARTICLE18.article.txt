Important Gardner contribution
overlooked in obituary
One of the notable characteristics of the
late John Gardner, whose death at 89 you
reported Tuesday ("Social reformer
Gardner dies"), was his talent for respond
ing to public needs by creating new non
profit organizations to fill the gaps.
Two of his creations in general inspired
orbit nary writers across the country — the
Urban Coalition, which for some years
tried to rally the corporate community to
do its part in meeting the crisis precipitat
ed by the assasination of Martin Luther
King; and the Common Cause, the self
styled "citizens' lobby" aimed at counter
ing the inordinate power in Washington
of what we now are accustomed to calling
"the special interests."
Many orbituaries, yours included,
failed to mention a third highly significant
national organization co-founded by
Gardner (with Brian ()' Connell) in
1980 — the Independent Sector. Until
then, non-profit organizations and the
funders that helped sustain them had
been separately organized nationally, but
they had no common voice and no es
tabished meeting ground. This made it
difficult for them to discuss and work to
gether to protect their shared interests,
such as preserving their tax-exempt status
and the deductibility from federal income
tax of charitable contributions.
Gardner and O'Connell worked for
nearly a decade to overcome the mutual
suspicions and turf-protectiveness that
were keeping these natural allies from co
alescing. The organization that eventually
resulted from this effort now has 800 or
ganizational members, ranging from the
American Red Cross to Libraries for the
Future and the National Council of La
Kaza. While it has hardly become a house
hold word — "Independent Sector" is not

exactly a rousing rallying cry — it has won
some important battles, such as fighting
off the persistent attempts in Congress to
limit the free speech of non-profits, under
the guise of limiting their capacity to lobby
congress.
I think it would sadden John to see this
omission from the incredible list of
acheivements over his long and construc

Pearl kidnappers deserve to be viewed
as murderers, not Muslims
As human beings, we usually have very
little foresight into what the future holds
for us. I'm sure when Daniel Pearl picked
journalism as a career, he was aware of its
dangers, but I'm sure his first-year room
mate at Stanford had no idea that Daniel
would someday meet the fate that he
has — an execution and death at the
hands of a ruthless group.
Pearl, as a journalist, was exploring "Is
lamic militants" when he was picked up.
We have no idea what his thoughts were in
taking this assignment. Perhaps he felt it
was important to understand Islamic mili
tants or maybe he just took it as a regular
task and worked day-to-day at it like a reg
ular job. We will never know. All we know
is that he no longer carries the burden of
understanding.
Hiat burden of understanding is now
ours as we cope with this tragedy. It is un
mistakeable — what has happened is
wrong by all accounts. Pearl's kidnappers
claimed to be retaliating to the treatment of
suspected militants captured in
Afghanistan. Regardless of one's politics on
the question of the suspected militants, they
cannot justify the death of Daniel Pearl.

Pearl's kidnappers would be quite
right, in my opinion, to object to the pro
posal of military tribunals or the racial
profiling that has sparked the U.S. gov
ernment to imprison people for long peri
ods for simply staying a few days past their
visas. These kidnappers would be abso
lutely correct to be disgusted by how peo
ple in the United States itself (and I am not
speaking about suspected al Qaeda mili
tants) have been held without charge and
without access to lawyers.
But they could never be correct in
killing a man uninvolved in these affairs of
war, a man whose weeping pregnant
widow will now have to face the reality of
raising their child alone. This is an act to be
condemned without doubt or hesitation.
Now I write as a Muslim. In the cover
age of these acts, one finds that the words
"Islam" and "Muslim" occupy different
parts of speech: sometimes a noun, other
times an adjective. Our intuitions may say
that this is the appropriate identification
since these people define themselves as Is
lamic militants.
Yet in the same way that I refuse to ac
cept the Ku Klux Klan or Kach positions
as representing white or Jewish people re
spectively, we have good grounds to resist
accepting the definitions and terms of
these wrong-doers.
Evil comes in many forms, and not
under simple guises of "Islam" or "the
West" or "White" or "Black." It is indeed a
quality of both good and evil that they
know no labels and pervade all of them.
To accept the terms of these criminals
would be to give them the legitimacy and
victory they desire. Instead, we should
tear off this cover of "Islam" they use to
justify themselves, and treat them in the
way that befits what they truly arc — mur
derers.
When Daniel Pearl's kidnappers assailed him,
what was probably going through their minds is
that he is part of the same machinery that is op
pressing Muslims, simply because he is an Ameri
can citizen. That is racial profiling — or national
profiling — to the most extreme degree.
It would be most unfortunate if we followed
the path of these madmen and subscribed to
racial profiling ourselves, for then, in this sup
posed "clash of civilizations," none of us would
have remained civilized.

without access to lawyers.
But they could never be correct in
killing a man uninvolved in these affairs of
war, a man whose weeping pregnant
widow will now have to face the reality of
raising their child alone. This is an act to be
condemned without doubt or hesitation.
Now I write as a Muslim. In the cover
age of these acts, one finds that the words
"Islam" and "Muslim" occupy different
parts of speech: sometimes a noun, other
times an adjective. Our intuitions may say
that this is the appropriate identification
since these people define themselves as Is
lamic militants.
Yet in the same way that I refuse to ac
cept the Ku Klux Klan or Kach positions

accepting the definitions and terms of
these wrong-doers.
Evil comes in many forms, and not
under simple guises of "Islam" or "the
West" or "White" or "Black." It is indeed a
quality of both good and evil that they
know no labels and pervade all of them.
To accept the terms of these criminals
would be to give them the legitimacy and
victory they desire. Instead, we should
tear off this cover of "Islam" they use to
justify themselves, and treat them in the
way that befits what they truly arc — mur
derers.
When Daniel Pearl's kidnappers assailed him,
what was probably going through their minds is
that he is part of the same machinery that is op
pressing Muslims, simply because he is an Ameri
can citizen. That is racial profiling — or national
profiling — to the most extreme degree.
It would be most unfortunate if we followed
the path of these madmen and subscribed to
racial profiling ourselves, for then, in this sup
posed "clash of civilizations," none of us would
have remained civilized.

One of the notable characteristics of the
late John Gardner, whose death at 89 you
reported Tuesday ("Social reformer
Gardner dies"), was his talent for respond
ing to public needs by creating new non
profit organizations to fill the gaps.
Two of his creations in general inspired
orbit nary writers across the country — the
Urban Coalition, which for some years
tried to rally the corporate community to
do its part in meeting the crisis precipitat
ed by the assasination of Martin Luther
King; and the Common Cause, the self
styled "citizens' lobby" aimed at counter
ing the inordinate power in Washington
of what we now are accustomed to calling
"the special interests."
Many orbituaries, yours included,
failed to mention a third highly significant
national organization co-founded by
Gardner (with Brian ()' Connell) in
1980 — the Independent Sector. Until
then, non-profit organizations and the
funders that helped sustain them had
been separately organized nationally, but
they had no common voice and no es
tabished meeting ground. This made it
difficult for them to discuss and work to
gether to protect their shared interests,
such as preserving their tax-exempt status
and the deductibility from federal income
tax of charitable contributions.
Gardner and O'Connell worked for
nearly a decade to overcome the mutual
suspicions and turf-protectiveness that
were keeping these natural allies from co
alescing. The organization that eventually
resulted from this effort now has 800 or
ganizational members, ranging from the
American Red Cross to Libraries for the
Future and the National Council of La
Kaza. While it has hardly become a house
hold word — "Independent Sector" is not

exactly a rousing rallying cry — it has won
some important battles, such as fighting
off the persistent attempts in Congress to
limit the free speech of non-profits, under
the guise of limiting their capacity to lobby
congress.
I think it would sadden John to see this
omission from the incredible list of
acheivements over his long and construc
tive life.

Pearl kidnappers deserve to be viewed
as murderers, not Muslims
As human beings, we usually have very
little foresight into what the future holds
for us. I'm sure when Daniel Pearl picked
journalism as a career, he was aware of its
dangers, but I'm sure his first-year room
mate at Stanford had no idea that Daniel
would someday meet the fate that he
has — an execution and death at the
hands of a ruthless group.
Pearl, as a journalist, was exploring "Is
lamic militants" when he was picked up.
We have no idea what his thoughts were in
taking this assignment. Perhaps he felt it
was important to understand Islamic mili
tants or maybe he just took it as a regular
task and worked day-to-day at it like a reg
ular job. We will never know. All we know
is that he no longer carries the burden of
understanding.
Hiat burden of understanding is now
ours as we cope with this tragedy. It is un
mistakeable — what has happened is
wrong by all accounts. Pearl's kidnappers
claimed to be retaliating to the treatment of
suspected militants captured in
Afghanistan. Regardless of one's politics on
the question of the suspected militants, they
cannot justify the death of Daniel Pearl.

Pearl's kidnappers would be quite
right, in my opinion, to object to the pro
posal of military tribunals or the racial
profiling that has sparked the U.S. gov
ernment to imprison people for long peri
ods for simply staying a few days past their
visas. These kidnappers would be abso
lutely correct to be disgusted by how peo
ple in the United States itself (and I am not
speaking about suspected al Qaeda mili
tants) have been held without charge and
without access to lawyers.
But they could never be correct in
killing a man uninvolved in these affairs of
war, a man whose weeping pregnant
widow will now have to face the reality of
raising their child alone. This is an act to be
