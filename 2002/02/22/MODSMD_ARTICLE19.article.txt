A caption on page 1 of yes
terday's Daily misidentified
one person in the picture. In
the picture, the second per
son from the left was not for
mer GSB Prof. Steve Westly.
It was actually Sen. Jon Ed
wards (l)-NC).
An article in Wednesday's
Daily, "Sunstein: Web deters
debate," incorrectly stated
when the book "Republic .com"
was released. The book was re
leased in April, not last month.
