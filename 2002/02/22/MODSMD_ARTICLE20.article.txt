## Trojans embarrass Cardinal at Maples, 77-58 USC hands Stanford worst home loss since 1993 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Earlier in the week, Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said
that one loss heading down the
stretch wouldn't be critical.
But what about one really
bad loss?

Thursday: No. 20 USC 77,
No. 10 Stanford 58

The Cardinal's 77-58 defeat
to the Trojans Thursday night
in front of a sold-out crowd at
Maples Pavilion was the worst
loss handed to Stanford at home
since the 1992-93 season when
the Cardinal fell to California,
8(5-61. 11 was also the worst loss
to the Trojans since the 1981
season.
"It's still just one loss,"
Montgomery emphasized after
the game. "But how you re
spond to it makes a difference.
It affects you mentally, sure.
Right now, USC is a better
team than we are."
The Cardinal (17-7, 10-5
Pacific 10 Conference), which
headed into the game tied for
first in the Pat-10 with South
ern California, dropped to
fourth in the conference, one
game behind the Trojans.
There's no doubting the ath
leticism of the Trojans â€” the
quick hands, the smothering
two-man traps. It was enough to
cause 27 turnovers last month at
the L.A. Sports Arena.
But this time, the Cardinal
thought it was ready. It prac
ticed all week against seven de
fenders to simulate the suffo
cating defense.
In the end, though, it was
clear that it was not nearly
enough.
Every time that Stanford
looked like it had figured out

the Trojan press, it turned the
ball over twice. Or three times.
Or four times.
And although the press
didn't seem as devastating, and
there was no distracting noise
from an opposing crowd, the
Cardinal never found its
rhythm, a rhythm that had cat
apulted it to four straight con
ference victories.
"The best team won. The
team that wanted it more, won.
They came in here and took it
at us. They were physical, got
after loose balls and played
well," Montgomery said.
Then, there was also the ab
sence of possibly the most im
portant Cardinal player from
the box score: Curtis Bor
chardt. After missing the first
game against the Trojans, this
was supposed to be Borchardt's
night to finally shine.
The good news? Borchardt
made his first shot.
The bad news? It came
three minutes into the second
half. Borchardt scored only
10 points and took just five
shots.
While Stanford's junior cen
ter struggled, USC senior power
forward Sam Clancy tallied his
nation-leading 11th straight
double-double of the year with
17 points and 11 rebounds.
"He's a smart player, and
the offense is designed for
him," said sophomore power
forward Teyo Johnson, who
guarded Clancy. "I didn't have
trouble physically, but he can
score with a little contact, and
that was the difference."
Stanford only trailed by one
going into the locker room, but
that's when USC really turned
it on.
On the first Cardinal posses
sion, an Errick Craven steal led
to an easy lay-up and a foul for
the Trojans. Another Stanford
turnover led to a David
Bluthenthal 3-pointer. And
then, two missed 3-pointers by
the Cardinal led to four more
