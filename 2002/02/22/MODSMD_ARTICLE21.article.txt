# USC gets best of Stanford...again
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Southern California came oul in the second
half like it owned the place.
The Trojans went on an 11-0 run to start the
half, and Stanford couldn't do anything at all to
stop them.
No matter how good the Trojans are, no mat
ter how many weeks they've held the first-place
spot in the Pacific 10 Conference, it still doesn't
feel right to lose to them.
Only the sporadic celebratory yells of the
Trojans and the chants of visiting USC fans from
the upper rafters of Maples remained as USC
walked off the court with Stanford's victory, with
Stanford's first-place standing and with Stan
ford's pride.
"It's one of those nights when you're playing
well and the other team isn't playing as well as
they typically would," said USC head coach
Henry Bibby. "They're a very good basketball
team and we're fortunate to come in here and
do this."
"We came out in the second half and we didn't
have any fire," said sophomore forward Teyo
Johnson. "It was obvious to everybody in the
arena that we were just stagnant."
Different game, same old story.
Only a couple of differences are apparent.
1. This time the Trojans decided to start with
the full-court press.
And its effectiveness was a little misleading.
Stanford looked a little less rattled by the full
court pressure this time around but the Cardinal
was clearly outside of its offensive comfort zone.
USC's pressure caused 16 turnovers this time
— nowhere near the 27 it caused four weeks ago.
But last night the press operated differently. It
took its time, slowly chipping away at the Cardi
nal's nerve, methodically taking Stanford out of
its half-court offense and slowly draining the in
tensity from this Cardinal squad.
2. This time around, junior center Curtis Bor
chardt was available to play, but his inside pres
ence was still lacking. Borchardt finished with 10
points and six rebounds.
"They did a pretty good job on Curtis," Mont
gomery said.
Borchardt sat out the majority of the first half
in foul trouble and his first field goal didn't come
until there were 16 minutes left in
the game.
Probably the press had some
thing to do with the big man's in
ability to get into an offensive
groove.
"We knew who was supposed to
get the basketball and we wanted
him to work harder," Bibby said.
"We thought Jacobsen, Barnes and
Borchardt were the guys that coulcl

beat vis, so we really tried to key in
on them."
"We switched things up a lot on
the defensive end, which keeps
teams ofF-balance," senior guard
Brandon Granville said.
"There wasn't much mystery to
that game," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery.
"[USC's] a very good basketball
team. SC's strong, big [and] tough.
We got to get stronger, bigger,
tougher. SC right now is a better
team than we,are. They won. They
deserved to win."
"[The loss is] hard because you

have a lot of pride," said Johnson,
who finished with nine points and
six rebounds. "You feel like you've
let your fans down, let your school
down. I'm not proud of that. I'm
ashamed of that."

something (o prove last night.
But unlike his CPA, the 6-foot-7
power forward didn't come up
short this time.
