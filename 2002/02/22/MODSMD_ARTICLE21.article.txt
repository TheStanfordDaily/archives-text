# USC gets best of Stanford...again
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Southern California came oul in the second
half like it owned the place.
The Trojans went on an 11-0 run to start the
half, and Stanford couldn't do anything at all to
stop them.
No matter how good the Trojans are, no mat
ter how many weeks they've held the first-place
spot in the Pacific 10 Conference, it still doesn't
feel right to lose to them.
Only the sporadic celebratory yells of the
Trojans and the chants of visiting USC fans from
the upper rafters of Maples remained as USC
walked off the court with Stanford's victory, with
Stanford's first-place standing and with Stan

"It's one of those nights when you're playing

USC's pressure caused 16 turnovers this time
â€” nowhere near the 27 it caused four weeks ago.
But last night the press operated differently. It
took its time, slowly chipping away at the Cardi
nal's nerve, methodically taking Stanford out of
its half-court offense and slowly draining the in
tensity from this Cardinal squad.
2. This time around, junior center Curtis Bor
chardt was available to play, but his inside pres
ence was still lacking. Borchardt finished with 10
points and six rebounds.
"They did a pretty good job on Curtis," Mont
gomery said.
Borchardt sat out the majority of the first half
in foul trouble and his first field goal didn't come
