Today-Sunday: No. 2 Stanford competes
at NFlA Leadoff Classic, Columbus, Ga.

"[The NFCA Classic] is a very prestigious
tournament," said junior outfielder (lassie
Brangham. "But we are playing confidently
right now and are going to try and look at ii
as an opportunity to improve."
Last year, Stanford used this tournament to
showcase its offense on its way to claiming the
tournament title. Having done the same at last
weekend's competition, the Cardinal is
primed to do it again in this year's edition of
the N FCA Classic.
"We have been hitting really well," said ju
nior pitcher Tori Nyberg. "We have had a lot of
energy and enthusiasm. We just need to carry
that into this weekend."
Not only has the Cardinal offense been

productive, but the Stanford pitching staff
has displayed its depth of talent early in the
season as well.
"1 think as a pitching staff and a team we are
building confidence wilh each win," Nyberg
said. "Going into Georgia we are going to try
and feed off that confidence."
The Cardinal's confidence will be tested
as it kicks off the tournament the same way
as it did in last weekend's by facing No. 14
Gal State Fullerton in the first of three pool
play games.
1 n their face-off last weekend, the Titans and
the Cardinal battled for seven innings, with
Stanford narrowly pulling out a 2-1 victory. Ny
berg won the pitching duel and led the Cardi
nal to its first tournament title of the season.
"I think fori did a phenomenal job last
weekend," said senior first baseman Sarah Bee
son. "She was so poised in the circle. 1 am just
excited to see what she can do."
Following the Cardinal's rematch with
Fullerton, Stanford will take on Missouri (3-5)
in its second game of the clay.
Missouri went 2-2 and took third place in
the Mizzou Round Robin last Sunday after
defeating Rhode Island 9-0 in the third
place game.
The Cardinal will then rest fora night before
taking on No. 25 Massachusetts (3-2) in its last
contest of the pool-play stage.
Massachusetts has suffered two straight loss
es after beginning the season 3-0. The Minute
women were blanked 1-0 by Arizona in their
most recent contest.
Following the completion of pool play, the
Cardinal will enter the elimination stage of the
tournament on Sunday.
Other NFC A Classic participants include
2001 College World Series qualifiers Louisiana
State, Michigan and Oklahoma, as well as soft
ball powerhouses Washington, Fresno State,
Alabama and Arizona State.
But the Cardinal is hardly fazed by the big
names on the tournament's bill and is excited for
the level of competition it will find in Georgia.
"We are looking lo continue the streak,"
Beeson said. "We are going out there with
something to prove."
