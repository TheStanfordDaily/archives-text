### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Baseball is a game of streaks,
and right now the No. 1 Cardi
nal (7-2) is on a hot one going
into this weekend's three-game
set against Santa Clara (4-0).
First off, the team is riding
five straight series victories dat
ing back to last season, including
series wins against No. 2 Florida
State, No. 12Cal State-Fullerton
and Fresno State, in addition to
a win over Brigham Young.
Second, the team has built an
impressive 19-game winning
streak against hxal rival Santa
Clara dating back to 1997.
Needless to say, the Cardinal

would bet against them.
While attributing individual
credit may be like picking a piece
of coal out of a blazing fire, Carlos
Quentin is leading the offensive
charge for Stanford. The sopho
more outfielder went 10 for 15
(.667) with a double, home run,
five RBI, and two stolen bases at
Fresno State last weekend. With
that impressive three-game show
ing, Quentin has now snatched
the team lead in several offensive
categories, including batting aver
age (.485), home runs (3), slug
ging percentage (.818), on-base
percentage (.578), and hit-by
pitches (7).
By no means is Quentin alone
in banging the ball around the
Sunken Diamond outfield this
season, as the Cardinal lineup
has flourished from top to bot
tom throughout its non-confer
ence schedule.
Perhaps the biggest surprise
has been the production the team
has gotten out of freshman Donny
Lucy. Lucy forced his way into the
starting lineup the second week
end of the year at Florida State and
looks as if he may never relinquish
his spot. Leading the team with 15
RBI to go along with two homers
and a .333 batting average, Lucy

has far surpassed the backup
catcher role head coach Mark
Marquess had in mind for him at
the beginning of the season.
Santa Clara will attempt to cool
down Lucy, Quentin and the rest
of the Cardinal bats this weekend
under the leadership of a familiar
face to the Cardinal, former assis
tant coach Mark O'Brien. Before
getting the job as head coach of the
Broncos this off-season, O'Brien
served as the Cardinal's hitting
and fielding instructor, as well as
the team's first base coach, during
the previous three years.
For tonight's series opener,
which gets underway at Sunken
Diamond at 6:05, O'Brien is send
ing righthander Chad Fillinger (0-
1, 1.76) to the hill to battle Cardi
nal ace junior Jeremy Outhrie (3-
0, 2.84).
Guthrie, who is looking for his
ninth straight victory dating back
to last year, is anchoring the Car
dinal's young staff, leading the
team with 21 strikeouts.
For Saturday's contest, which
will be played at Santa Clara, the
Broncos will use lefty John Red
mond (2-1, 1.45) while Stanford
has yet to announce its starter.
Back at the Farm on Sunday af
ternoon, it will be a battle of south
paws, as the Broncos' Joe Diefend
erfer (1 -2,7.62) will try to stop (Car
dinal junior Tim Cunningham (3-
0, 1.93) from extending his nine
game winning streak.
