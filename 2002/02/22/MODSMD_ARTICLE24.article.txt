## No. 1 men's swimming and diving hosts No. 4 Golden Bears 
### KENNETH GARRETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
By the time you started push
ing the snooze button every
morning for (he last four years,
they were already done with their
two-hour morning workout. Be
fore you even threw away the
wrapping paper at Christmas,
they had already started training.
Since 1998, they have sacrificed
their afternoons, their Saturdays,
and, yes, their body hair.

MEN'S SWIMMING AND
DIVING
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford vs.
No 4 California, 1:00 p.m.,
Avery Aquatic Center

But the seniors of the Stanford
men's swim team had a goal they
wanted so badly they could taste
it. So they sweated and burned
and paid their dues for four long
years.
And now they are collecting
their dividends.
Jeff Guyman, Peter Lennox-
King, Michael O'Neil and Mark
Siebert stand at the helm of the
top-ranked, undefeated Cardinal
men's swim team (7-0, 3-0 Pacific
10 Conference). Tomorrow, they
look to crush No. 4 California (6-
1, 3-0) on the way to Stanford's
21st consecutive Pac-10 victory
and an NCAA championship.
But these guys are the first to
admit their future didn't always
look so rosy.
"We couldn't hold our own in
meets or in practice our first
year," Lennox-King said.
And after very successful high
school careers, finding them
selves far from the medal stand
was very frustrating.
"We wanted to contribute so
badly, but were just not ready,"
Siebert said.
When most people would
have quit, however, these ath
letes met the challenge with
everything they had.

"These guys believed in them
selves and fought for what they
wanted every day," said head
coach Skip Kenney. "They could
have gone to schools where they
would have easily been at the top
of the team from the beginning,
but they came to Stanford. 1 have
so much respect for kids that
come in as underdogs, but never
stray from their goals."
Without the persistence and
work ethic of each man in this
class, nobody on the team would
be where he is today.
"The superstars can only do

well because of the atmosphere
the rest of the team creates," Ken
ney said. "This senior class helped
create a really positive atmos
phere and good team chemistry."
From there, the victories fol
lowed naturally.
By never accepting limitations
on their own potential, the se
niors have instilled a sense of fear
lessness in the rest of the team,
which has translated into aston
ishing achievements by many
Cardinal swimmers.
