# Seniors propel Card to Cal
## No. 1 men's swimming and diving hosts No. 4 Golden Bears 
### KENNETH GARRETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
By the time you started push
ing the snooze button every
morning for (he last four years,
they were already done with their
two-hour morning workout. Be
fore you even threw away the
wrapping paper at Christmas,
they had already started training.
Since 1998, they have sacrificed
their afternoons, their Saturdays,
and, yes, their body hair.

MEN'S SWIMMING AND
DIVING
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford vs.
No 4 California, 1:00 p.m.,
Avery Aquatic Center

But the seniors of the Stanford
men's swim team had a goal they
wanted so badly they could taste
it. So they sweated and burned
and paid their dues for four long
years.
And now they are collecting
their dividends.
Jeff Guyman, Peter Lennox-
King, Michael O'Neil and Mark
Siebert stand at the helm of the
top-ranked, undefeated Cardinal
men's swim team (7-0, 3-0 Pacific
10 Conference). Tomorrow, they
look to crush No. 4 California (6-
1, 3-0) on the way to Stanford's
21st consecutive Pac-10 victory
and an NCAA championship.
But these guys are the first to
admit their future didn't always
look so rosy.
"We couldn't hold our own in
meets or in practice our first
year," Lennox-King said.
And after very successful high
school careers, finding them
selves far from the medal stand
was very frustrating.
"We wanted to contribute so
badly, but were just not ready,"
Siebert said.
When most people would
have quit, however, these ath
letes met the challenge with
everything they had.

"These guys believed in them
selves and fought for what they
wanted every day," said head
coach Skip Kenney. "They could
have gone to schools where they
would have easily been at the top
of the team from the beginning,
but they came to Stanford. 1 have
so much respect for kids that
come in as underdogs, but never
stray from their goals."
Without the persistence and
work ethic of each man in this
class, nobody on the team would
be where he is today.
"The superstars can only do

well because of the atmosphere
the rest of the team creates," Ken
ney said. "This senior class helped
create a really positive atmos
phere and good team chemistry."
From there, the victories fol
lowed naturally.
By never accepting limitations
on their own potential, the se
niors have instilled a sense of fear
lessness in the rest of the team,
which has translated into aston
ishing achievements by many
Cardinal swimmers.


MARIO SCUSSEL/The Stanford Daily
Seniors Peter Lennox-King, Mark Siebert, Jeff Guyman and Michael O'Neil
will lead the No. 1 Cardinal against No. 4 California this weekend.
"Guys who came to Stanford
already fast have no fear of doing
something absolutely ridiculous
now," said O'Neil. "We seniors
are always looking for ways we
can get better, and it has rubbed
off on the other guys."
The benefits of being on a team
didn't just How one way.
"Skip and the team create an
atmosphere where it is easy for us
to succeed and reach our goals,"
Siebert said.
Though their goals seemed
lofty four years ago, the seniors
are now poised not only to qualify
for the NCAA championships in
dividually, but also to score cru
cial points towards the Cardinal's
bid for the NCAA title.
But even without point contri
butions or titles, the victory would
still be theirs.
"I'd take character over points
any day," Kenney said.
Though they have found room
to improve their swimming, c har
acter is something this class has
never lacked.
"All four come from great fam
ilies, so all four know how to care
for others," Kenney said. "And
because of the strength of their
families, their self-images are

strong enough that they can show
the guys on the team they care for
them. I just couldn't have more
respect for this senior class."
The freshmen knew this from
their first day.
"It was obvious they really
cared and wanted to help us learn
to do things the Stanford way,"
freshman Matt McDonald said.
"It has continued throughout the
year."
Not surprisingly, the four easi
ly agreed on what they'll miss the
most about their swimming ca
reers: their teammates.
"The entire team is such an in
spiration," Guyman said .
Now as they come to the final
dual meet of their collegiate ca
reers tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at
the Avery Aquatic Center, emo
tions are mixed.
"I am sad, especially because
the dual meets have been so ex
citing the last two years," Guy
man said.
But they also look at their last
dual meet with their characteris
tic confidence and determination.
"It will be exciting to finish
our Stanford dual-meet careers
against a tough opponent with a
win," Siebert said. "It's going to
be a fast meet."
And with these seniors lead
ing the team tomorrow, nothing
should stand in the way of a Car
dinal victory.
