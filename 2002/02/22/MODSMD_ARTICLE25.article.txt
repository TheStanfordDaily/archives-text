As disheartening as it must be
for the California football team to
perennially lose to Stanford, an
even bleaker fate awaits Cal's
men's tennis team.

MEN'S TENNIS
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford vs.
No. 18 California, 3:00 p.m.,
Taube Family Tennis Stadium

At least the Golden Bears know
that in football, you can only lose
once a year.
No. 17 Cal (5-3) will look to sal
vage some self-respect this Satur
day when it faces No. 1 Stanford
(7-0) for the first time this year at
3:00 p.m. on Saturday at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
The Pacific 10 Conference sea
son opener for the Cardinal and
the Golden Bears can potentially
be a validation for both teams.
The Cardinal is eager to prove
its position at the top of the men's
collegiate tennis world with a dual
meet win over a team ranked in
the top 20.
The Golden Bears hope to im
prove on their recent dismal perfor
mances against Stanford. Cal has
lost 12 straight matches to the Car
dinal and has dropped 70 of the 82
meet points in those contests.
The all-time match record since
1967 between the cross-bay rivals
favors Stanford, 71-9.
"We're looking forward to a
good challenge on Saturday," said
associate head coach John
Whitlinger. "Cal is a tough team
that's gotten a lot better. It) the

Stanford-Cal rivalry, you can
throw (lie records out."
The red-hot Stanford team
enters the match coming off of a
(5-0 thrashing of No. 51 San
Diego (2-5) last Tuesday. Stan
ford won all six singles matchups
— three in convincing straight
set victories — before rain can
celed the doubles matches.
Sophomore Joe Kao, debuting
in singles play, quickly crushed his
opponent, 6-1,6-2.
Additional straight-set victories
were added by senior K.J. Hip
pensteel and junior David Martin.
Hippensteel, currently the top
ranked singles player in the na
tion, downed his opponent, 6-4,6-
2, while No. 49 Martin cruised to a
0-2, 7-5 victory.
"We're definitely ready for Cal,"
Kao said. "It's going to be a lough
match after this, but we're ready to
defend our No. I ranking."
California also posted a solid
thumping of San Diego on
Wednesday in its last match. The
Golden Bears trounced the
I oreros, 6-1, in Berkeley, marking
their fourth straight home win.
the Cardinal's
victory on Tuesday marked the
75th-straight home match won in
Taube since 1996.
"We take a lot of pride in our
home courts, and hope our streak
keeps growing," said Whitlinger.
The Cardinal remains in the
top spot in the new team rankings
released this week, followed close
ly by Illinois, while Georgia,
Southern California, and UCLA
round out the top five. Along with
No. 8 Baylor, Stanford is just one
of two undefeated teams remain
ing in the top 10.
