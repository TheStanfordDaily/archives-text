ment yesterday that acknowl
edged Pearl's death.
"We now believe, based on
reports from the U.S. State De

the Pakistani province ofSindh,
that Danny Pearl was killed by
his captors," said Wall Street
Journal Managing Editor Paul
Steiger. "We're heartbroken at
his death."
Neither the State Depart

ment nor the Wall Street Jour
nal stated what specific evidence
they had of Pearl's death.
The Associated Press report
ed that Pakistani officials had a
videotape showing Pearl being
killed by his kidnappers.
In the past week, Pakistani of

ers held in Cuba.
Members of the Stanford com
munity expressed regret at
Pearl's death and commended
him for his work, both at Stanford
and beyond.
"Daniel's pursuit of truth —
even at his own peril — repre
sents the very highest values of a
free press in a democratic soci
ety," said University President
John Hennessy.
Pearl graduated with distinc
tion and with honors from Stan
ford, receiving a bachelor's in
communication. He was also a
fraternity member, co-founded
a non-partisan political newspa
per and wrote occasionally for
The Daily.
Communication Prof. Emerita
Marion Lewenstein, who worked
with Pearl on an independent pro
ject when he was a student at Stan
ford, described him as standing
out, even in a sea of talent.
"He stood out from the other
students, bright as Stanford stu
dents are," she said. "He was al

ways going at things at a slightly
different angle."
In his statement yesterday,
Steiger denounced the behavior
of Pearl's abductors as working
counter to their goals and those
of Pakistanis.
"His murder is an act of bar
barism," Steiger said. "It makes a
mockery of everything that
Danny's kidnappers claimed to be
lieve in."
"They claim to be Pakistani na
tionalists but their actions must
surely bring blame to all true Pak
istani patriots."
Besides Pearl's professional
success, those who knew him em
phasized his personal qualities.
"Danny was an outstanding col
league, a great reporter, and dear
friend of many at the Journal,"
Steiger said.
"Danny was a beloved son, a
brother, an uncle, a husband and a
father to a child who will never
know him," a Pearl family
spokesperson said yesterday.
Pearl is survived by his wife,
Mariane, who is almost seven
months pregnant with the cou
ple's first child.
