# No. 1 Card looks for title repeat at UCSB
## Stanford earns one of four top seeds for tournament featuring nation's best teams 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford women's water
polo team has barely scratched the surface
of its 2002 schedule, but the Cardinal is al
ready facing some of its toughest competi
tion of the season.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
Saturday-Sunday: No. 1 Stanford
competes at Gaucho Invitational, Santa
Barbara, Calif.

The Stanford squad heads to the Gau
cho Invitational at UC-Santa Barbara this
weekend to square off with all of its
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation rivals
in just its second competition of the year.
Entering the tournament as the de
fending champions, the Cardinal will re
ceive one of the four the No. 1 seeds in
the tournament. No. 2 UCLA, No. 3
Southern California and No. 4 California
are the other the top seeds.
The Cardinal opened its season with a
championship in the Stanford Invitational
two weekends ago, cruising to a 4-0 record.
"We have an entirely new team this
year and I think facing these very strong

conference teams before league play
starts will help us a lot," said junior goalie
Jackie Frank. "/VII the teams have differ
ent style of play and its good for us to be
exposed to them.
"Teams are always changing a lot
throughout the season and every time
we face these teams we have to expect
something different."
The Cardinal takes to the pool bright
and early on Saturday morning, taking
on No. 18 Pacific at 8:00 a.m. With a vic
tory, Stanford will face either UC-Santa
Barbara or Long Beach State, who are
both currently tied for seventh in the na
tional rankings.
Should the Cardinal advance, it will most
likely face the other top-seeded teams as the
tournament concludes on Sunday.
The team already has an edge over USC
and UCLA, as the Cardinal defeated both
teams last weekend on the Farm.
Stanford will look to its strong offense
to lead it through the tournament. In
just four games, the Cardinal has scored
44 goals, almost three times as many as
its opponents.
This tournament will serve as a bridge
into MPSF play, which begins in two weeks
against the Gauchos and the Bruins.
"We have a lot of freshmen, and this
tournament will give them a chance to get
some important experience," Frank said.
"Also, just watching those teams play
against each other helps us learn a lot
about what works and doesn't work
against them."
