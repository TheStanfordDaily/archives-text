# 'Vagina' dry, but pleasurable

Despite their historical popularity,
vaginas are rarely discussed in public.
Popular culture has had an ongoing lust
affair with the penis — for example,
"Portnoy's Complaint," "American Pie"
and Robert Plant's tight-ass pants. Howev
er, vagina discourse was very much alive
in Kresge Auditorium on Feb. 13, when

The Vagina Monologues

"The Vagina Monologues" played to a
large audience resplendent in indie-rock
er finery. "The Vagina Monologues," by
Eve Ensler, is a series of monologues in
terspersed with various factoids, culled
from interviews with ovfer 200 women.
After an introduction by Sara Neff, the
whole cast came out from behind the cur
tains, spouting a startling list of euphemisms
for vagina, including "pussycat," "twat,"
powderbox," "Gladys Spiegelman," "nappy
dugout," "dignity," "split knish" and, of
course, "c<XK:hie snorcher." It was ridicu
lous, showcasing the length people will go
not to say "vagina."
After that promising beginning, howev-

er, the show failed to win me
over completely.
1 didn't like the rah-rah
"vagina liber alles" booster
ism. It felt embarrassing, not
because I have any particular
hang-ups regarding my own
vagina, but because it felt too
smug and forced.
Yes, vaginas are awesome
ly cool. That much is true. But
I cringed when I heard phras
es such as "I am my vagina,"
and "My vagina wants every
thing," which only furthers
the image of a vagina as a
grasping, primordial maw, as
fearsome as the eye of Sauron.
(Tell me the eye of Sauron
doesn't look like a big, fiery
vagina in the movie!)
Another problem with
the show was its awkward
transitions. It was unsettling
to go straight from a horrify
ing statement about female
genital mutilation in Africa

to a woman's rant about tampons —
"dry wads of fucking cotton!"
Rarely do I ever dislike any artistic cre
ation wholeheartedly, unless it comes
from Creed. "The Vagina Monologues"
was no different.
There were many parts of the show
that I loved. The quality of acting was uni
formly good, with many standouts.
Brooke Fineberg was alternately funny

and pitiful as a septuagenarian virgin who
referred to her vagina as "down there."
Miriam Beyer, also the director* ranted
against the mean cold duck lips of the
speculum, which is highly meaningful to
anyone who has had a pelvic exam. Lau
ren Elliston was quietly devastating as a
Bosnian woman raped by a soldier.
One of the grandest moments came to
wards the end of the show. Mary Haw is a
virtuoso. As the "lawyer turned leather-

and-whip-equipped-prostitute
who loved to moan and make
other women moan t<x)," she
demonstrated multitudes of or
gasmic moans, such as the clit
moan, the vaginal moan, the
WASP moan, the doggy moan,
the uninhibited militant bisex
ual moan, the machine-gun
moan and the triple-orgasm
moan. Good stuff.
An interesting thing I ob
served was the male reactions
to the show. The young man
sitting next to me was very en
thusiastic, mostly about the
prospect of pretty girls talking
about sex. When KC George's
character described her acci
dental orgasm on a treadmill
at the gym, he murmured,
"Aw man, that's cool." On the
other had, my male friend
walked out of the show after a
few monologues. He hated,
hated, hated it.

There were moments of
real hilarity, passion, and sadness. But for
me, they were overshadowed by some of the
sentimental, hooha writing ("eccentric
tulip," for one, and why exactly does the
vagina remind everyone of a flower?) and
the idea that the vagina is who we are.
Nice to bring the greatness of the vagina
in the public light, but it was too over
done. I won't be going out singing, "I am
vagina, hear me roar."


"Daddy, whaf s a beaver?"
