# 'Caveman' revels in the obvious
## 
### SANDEEP GOPALAN 
Ifyou expect Rob Becker's "Defending the Caveman" to
enlighten yon about the peculiar chemistry that exists be
tween men and women, you are likely to be sorely disap-

pointed. Forget chemistry,
you won't even find any biol
ogy or math, but if you leave
your brains behind or are
middle-aged and /or miser
ably married, this one will
make you chortle. The audi
ence fit this bill so there was
raucous laughter.
The premise of Becker's
90-minute solo spiel is the
theory that the differences
between the genders stem
from their roles as hunters
and gatherers. Ergo, men are
driven by their primal need
to hunt, and gathering is sec
ond nature to women (vege
tarian Cavemen and hunting
women don't exist).
Becker's Caveman sees
even such mundane tasks as
shopping as a modern-day
hunt: "Me want shirt. Me get
shirt. Go home, watch TV."
This idea is unlikely to earn
him a doctoral degree at

Stanford, but even as a gross simplification, it is not very
persuasive. One suspects that in an attempt to cut to the
bone, Becker has unfortunately shaved off too much.
A California native, Becker was a college dropout who
owned a sandwich-shop franchise in Santa Rosa in the

early '80s. Realizing that comedy was
more fun than smearing mayonnaise
on slices of bread, he dumped his
apron and tried his hand at San
Francisco's comedy clubs. His man
ner is endearing and his chubby
looks anything but Caveman-like,
both serving as the major aids his de
fense of the Caveman.
After establishing a record as
Broadway's greatest solo hit (break
ing the record previously held by Lily
Tomlin's "The Search For Signs of
Intelligent Life in the Universe"),
and celebrating its 10th anniversary,
it would be churlish to carp too much
about "Defending the Caveman." As
a tribute to its success, Mayor Rudy
Giuliani renamed a part of West 44th
Street as "Caveman Way." Having
lived on West 42nd Street fora few
months, I must confess that I didn't
see too many Cavemen in the neigh
borhood (there were a lot of women
gatherers, though).
With a set consisting of a spear, an
armchair, a stone TV, and a pile of

underwear, one is not sure if the show is more of a solo
stand-up comedy routine rather than theatre. Such details
didn't stop the crowds, and I must confess to never having
seen so many people laugh so uproariously at the obvious.
Couples linked hands, nodded their heads in acknowledg
ment as if some deep truth had been revealed, old men
looked longingly at their wives again, and even those less
easily satisfied had to concede a few laughs.
Perhaps all that laughter had addled a few brains. When
Becker questioned the female members of the audience as

Defending the Caveman
Dir. Rob Bccker
Curran Theater C m

to whether they
would prefer the
statement that
"women are not
hindered bylogic"
to "women are hin
dered by logic," tlx
only discernible an
svver was confusion.

Finally, most women
conceded that they didn't like either statement. 1 doubt if even
Einstein can make sense of that! If anything, it proved what
we knew all along â€” even the devil knoweth not the mind
of a woman.
It is clear that Becker's main constituency is among the
married classes. If you can't seem to comprehend why your
spouse monopolizes the remote and keeps switching chan
nels, Becker can tell you that he's merely relapsing to his
Caveman heritage and hunting to "kill channels". Forget
the nuances and this one will make even the Caveman
laugh. See it after an argument with your girlfriend. It's
better than TV.
