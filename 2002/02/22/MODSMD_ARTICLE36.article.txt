# More than 5 questions with Craig
## 
### SCOTT DORFMAN 
For the last three years, Craig Kilborn
has been the host of CBS's "Late Late
Show with Craig Kilborn," following two
three-year stints, first as an anchor on
ESPN's "Sports Center" and then on Com l
edy Central's "The Daily Show." During
his time at CBS, Kilborn has run what one
television critic has called the "longest
running continuous bachelor party on
television," helping the network establish
a foothold in the 18-to-24-year-old demo
graphic. In a question-and-answer session
with The Daily, Kilborn exhibited his
somewhat less than self-deprecating
brand of humor on a range of issues,
speaking about his broadcasting career,
former employers and relations with late
night talk show competitors.
INTERMISSION: How much of the Craig
Kilborn we see on the air is the real you?
In what ways are you different off-camera?
KILBORN: It's all an act. Every bit of it.
Off-camera, I'm a completely different
person. Except I actually do travel with a
mirror at all times, everywhere I go.
INTERMISSION: How much prep time
do you generally have with guests before
going on the air? Do you go over ques
tions or scenarios?
KILBORN: The show's producers will
call the person the night before they go on
and will generally go over some talking
points. But we're unique in that we break
with set questions a lot of the time, to give
the show more of a natural flow. It conies
from the approach of the show, which is
more low-key.
INTERMISSION: Most of us at Stanford
had our first taste of your work when you
did Sports Center. Does it bother you that
the guys 011 ESPN seem to be stealing
your routine?
KILBORN: I think it's bullshit. I was in-

terviewed by Bob Costas
recently on a radio pro
grain and be said all
these guys are trying to
be funny and seem like
they're auditioning to
land a sitcom or some
tiling. I apologize if I
started something over
there. They should just
stop, be themselves and
know that they're going
to spend the rest of their
lives in Bristol [Connecti
cut J.
INTERMISSION: How
much freedom do you
feel CBS gives you to say
and do what you want on
the air, especially given
the Bill Maher â€” Sept.
11 controversy?
KILBORN: They don't
bother me. I mean, we
are going to make some
bad jokes, and every six
months I should be
apologizing for some-

thing I said. It's part of having an edge.
Although if you watch closely, I'm pretty
careful.
There are boundaries that you just know.
Sometimes there seems to be contradictions
in what I say, but it's consistent to me. There
are certain things I will not say. I won't say
the Vagina Monologues, I say the V-Mono
logues. I don't really like the word penis, I
prefer to say crank. One of the reasons I got
into comedy is because 1 think we as a soci
ety take things too seriously.
INTERMISSION: There was a movie that
highlighted the rivalry and animosity be
tween Leno and Letterman. Does any
thing like that exist between you and
Conan O'Brien?
KILBORN: I think Conan is a really nice

guy, actually. I met him and had dinner
with him in New York when I had just
taken the Late Late Show job and was fin
ishing up at the Daily Show. We just hap
pened to be in the same restaurant, and we
had a good conversation. The Letterman
and Leno rivalry springs I think from the
fact that they both got their start at the
Comedy Store together, while Conan got
his start in writing. So we've never had that
kind of relationship, or rivalry.
INTERMISSION: How about with Car
son Daly?
KILBORN: Nah, no rivalry between me
and Carson. I don't really think you
should be scared of anyone under five
foot-ten.
INTERMISSION: Is Anna Kournikova

as difficult to work with as some people
have said?
KILBORN: I worked with her once. She
wasn't difficult at all on the set of our show,
but chances are that she is.
INTERMISSION: Letterman and John
ny Carson have both done late-night for
more than 20 years, and Leno is ap
proaching 10 years himself. How long do
you want to do this, and do you think that
far in advance?
KILBORN: I really can't think that far in
advance. Every job I've had over the last
ten years has been three years. It was three
at Monterey, three at ESPN, three at the
Daily Show, and it will be three years here
in March. This particular job is pretty
much a dream job, so I'll stick with this.


"Dido, I promise it's just an act. Off camera, I'm a completely different guy."
