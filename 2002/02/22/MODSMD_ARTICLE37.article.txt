# Campus band scores at Toon's
## 
### REBECCA TALBOTT 
Complete with supportive fans and heart-swelling music

appreciation by all, the now-three official
off-campus gigs in the Bay Area for Blind
Man's Dream have been very well-re
ceived — both by its impressive Stanford
following, as well as by the healthy smat
tering of neighborhood lcx:als at their its
small-bar venues.
Blind Man's Dream, an all-Stanford

foursome, features seniors Bradley
Markham, Jason Luker, Andrew Holt and Mike Charyk.
Their acoustic and electric guitars alternately take center
stage in upbeat, danceable melodies and blooming guitar
lines. Their lyrics are sincere, delivered in a gentle croon
somewhere between Rob Thomas, Don Henley and Lisa
Loeb with a sex change.
For two Sundays in a row at the San Jose nightclub
Toon's, the band showed a friendly but mature face, singing
about the usual loves, heartbreaks and frustrations but with
a sophisticated handle fora wide range of emotions.
Their act, familiar to most of the audience through infor
mal dorm room jam sessions, has the usual division of band

labor — frontman Markham takes care of the vocals and
plays acoustic and lead-guitarist-with-mystique Luker adds
creative backbone to the melody with his electric guitar work.

Bass-player Charyk and drummer Holt
flesh out the songs and combine to form a
capable rhythm section.
Among the show's highlights was"I Don't
Want To," a song that would easily feel at
home on modern-rock radio. An accessible
number, it pulls you in at the bridge with
bouncy staccato chords. BMD crossed over

into many other moods as well, following
two songs later with the ethereal "Alone," the countrified
"(ireen Grass" and the liberating "To My Knees," a love an
them that sprouts from the band's alternative-rock roots.
Boasting a two-hour set of original works, BMD also
played to both the crowd's preferences and its own icons by
doing two covers. Probably as more of an excuse to let
Charyk use the restroom, Markham performed a solo ren
dition of' Burn One Down," by Ben I larper, while the band
as a whole joined in on "Flake," by Jack Johnson, revealing
the latent folk vein in the group.
The climax of the set, however, was when, despite all of
their work to present themselves as respectable musical tal

ents, the band eventually succumbed to the demands from
the insistent crowd to finish off the night with a tune that has
become a comic cult classic among the band's friends.
A joke song written freshman year that nonetheless re
fuses to be retired, the first chords immediately drew the
suddenly raucous fans to the foot of the stage, becoming a
sort of Mother-Goose-Gone-Wrong sing-along among fun
loving, irreverent college kids.
The funniest thing about this moment, however, was ob
serving the unassuming bystanders in the bar who, oblivious
to the actual words that were being sung, continued to tap
their feet and nod their heads idly to the beat, blissfully ig
norant of the song's content.
Like any band, BMD will tell you that their music is "hard
to classify" and "draws on a lot of influences." And it's unde
niably true — you can hear very diverse echoes in their
songs. What really sets them apart from other younger
bands, though, is that they are not afraid of melody .balanced
guitars or making people happy. They dare to write pop
music — and pull it off.
(Blind Man's Dream also played the Phi Kappa Psi Battle of the
Bands competition in Toyon Hall on Saturday, February 16. For
