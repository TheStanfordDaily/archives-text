# Musical Bacchanal at Toyon
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM NICK ADAMS 
Have you ever left Toyon Lounge so upset about never
having gone to space camp that you felt compelled to bounce
to Braun and shatter a violin in a fit of animalistic rage?
Neither have we.
But this could conceivably have happened to a sufficiently
inebriated Stanford student after attending Phi I'si's 12th an
nual Battle of the Bands competition last Saturday night.
Phi Psi did a commendable job of amassing a group of
performers from different musical genres, within the cate
gory of "rock" and outside it, and with drastically different
stage antics. While each individual band maintained a con
sistent sound in its own set, the overall variety of perfor
mances helped sustain interest for audience members who
came for the battle instead of to hear one specific band.
Blind Man's Dream kicked off Phi Psi's musical orgy loan
only pseudo-attentive Toyon Lounge rather promptly at 10
p.m. Despite this attention to punctuality, one astute and al
legedly vision-impaired audience member claimed that this
band was, in truth, not his dream. And we don't blame him.
The group's rock sound was uninspiring. Each instru
ment played one riff and stuck to it. The songs seemed to
blend together, each essentially devoid of variation.
Coupled with a flat stage presence, Blind Man's Dream
provided a nice backdrop for socializing. We weren't fanta
sizing about poking our own eyes out, but Blind Man's
Dream produced nothing remarkable in the way of a show.
60/40 Breakdown saved us from counting sheep. Play
ing a sound roughly similar to that of Blind Man's Dream,
60 / 40 took it to die next level by producing a wider variety
in its rhythms and more complex chord variations. By the

final song, 60/40 most certainly had the crowd bumpin' —
and justifiably so.
Their set was hindered by keyboardist Drew Baglino's
amp breaking after the first song. The overall success of
60 / 40's performance was a testament to the band's profes
sionalism and skill, as the band was not visibly disrupted by
the malfunction and put on an inspiring show sans one of its
key components.
Now, we need to take a time out from discussing bands to
broach a far more troubling issue. Why for the love of a
benevolent god would a DJ play rap music in between sets at
a rock concert?
Seriously. What the hell?
But our bewildering confusion was at least temporarily
assuaged when defending champ o.n.e. assumed the lime
light, introducing a hip hop sound into Phi Psi's doglight.
Initially, o.n.e.'s performance was slightly jolting. Starting off
with a slow vocal ballad, the group quickly switched into an
upbeat hip hop sound that seemed frantic relative to the
music of the preceding hour.
This feeling of disorientation quickly diminished as o.n.e.
continued playing and the audience had a chance to warm
up to its different style. What set it apart was its combination
of an extroverted stage presence with masterful playing by
the drummer and bassist. We could have our cake and eat it
too — it tasted yummy.
o.n.e.'s interactive antics — entreating students to get out
lighters (or backlit cell phones) and wave their arms, for ex
ample — engaged the audience in a way none of the other
bands even tried to.
Commanding vocalists did not overshadow the group's
musical core, o.n.e.'s bass player used slap techniques and
funk bass playing style to add a rhythmic dimension to the

set, while its drummer kept time not only well, but also with
interesting licks.
Next, Leonard, playing a sound a la No Doubt, brought
back the rock to Battle of the Bands, but we were more in
clined to go and hide under one than stay and listen. All of
their songs, drawn out and frustratingly simple, seemed to
run together. Band members tried to create a more outgo
ing stage presence, similar to o.n.e.'s, but lead singer Jill
Wheaton appeared visibly uncomfortable on stage and the
group's effort to relate to the audience seemed forced.
Leonard finished off its set with "Space Camp,"a perfor
mance that drew yelps of excitement from a small faction of
fans. For the rest of us, the slow-paced ballad was flat and
proved a tedious ending to an uninspiring set that almost
plunged us into an inescapable abyss of negative space.
The final band, Ten Mile Tide, brought the audience
back to earth with its masterful southern style, eclectic array
of instruments and lively demeanor. len Mile Tide added
a violin and piano to the typical rock ensemble, giving its
music a pleasing richness and density. Departing from
other bands, it started its set with a cover of "The Devil Went
Down to Georgia." While it performed the song without a
glitch, it left the audience wanting by not deviating at all
from the original.
Nonetheless, Ten Mile Tide captivated the lingering on
lookers with iLs acoustic sound and energy, which even man
aged to so thoroughly stir the violinist that he culminated the
show by smashing his own instrument.
All in all, Battle of the Bands whetted our palates with a
taste of tunes from several certifiably kickin' Stanford bands.
Though slow at times, the show provided eclectic entertain
ment and exposed the masses to some campus bands who
.deserved to be heard.
