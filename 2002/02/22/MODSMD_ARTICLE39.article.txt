# Shaham: success against the odds
## 
### EREZ YOELI 
At 31, C.il Shaham is one of the world's
most famous violinists, and he speaks with
the quiet confidence of one who has made it
against impossible odds.
At the age of 1 1, without knowing a
word of English, he left Jerusalem and
moved to New York. His parents, gradu
ates of the University of Illinois, were con
summate music lovers. They sent the
young violinist to Juilliard's weekly
preparatory school and enrolled him in
the famed Horace Mann School.
New York, says Shaham, "was a shock."
Daunted by the city's sheer size and the lan
guage barrier, Shaham retreated into the
practice room. School was not a priority and
Shaham's impressions of it were not far from
comic Bob Montana's — the latter had based
Archie's Riverdale High on Horace Mann
many years earlier.
After graduating, Shaham attended J mil
liard full-time. This, however, did not last
long. The purchase of his Stradivarius — the
violin which he uses to this day — left Sha
ham deeply in debt, and he spent his days
working to pay to it off. Kventually, the school
suggested that he discard the pretense of
being a student, and, though he continued to
take private lessons fora while longer, Sha
ham left Juilliard.
Shaham modestly maintains that his ca
reer was founded upon "lots of luck,' and
that "it could have gone many different
ways." He even believes that purchasing and
financing of his violin was good fortune. I he
seller, says Shaham, was "generous," allow

ing him the opportunity of a first buy, and
foregoing the opportunity to make millions
off of wealthy collectors.
Today, Shaham lives in the Upper West
Side with his wife of three years, Adele Antoni
— an Australian violinist who he met over ten
years ago. He laughed when I asked if he
misses having a back yard. "I'm a city boy. I
love it here," lie says.
He complains mildly that his visit to San
Francisco this week will not include a stay
with his older brother, who no longer lives in
the Bay Area, and jokes casually about play
ing with his younger sister, Orli, an accom
plished pianist.
Ironically, now that they have grown up
and launched separate careers, Gil and Orli
play together more often than they had as
children. Shaham says that working with his
sister "has its advantages. Rehearsals are sim
pler and it is easier to communicate" without
the formalities exchanged between players.
Their next joint project is Mendelssohn's
"Dual Concerto," which the)' will perform
next month in Philadelphia.
Why did two of the most widely praised
musicians of this generation come from the
same household? Shaham's parents played
classical music constantly over the stereo, and
provided their children with finest teachers
in the area. Shaham fondly remembers his
parents reading through Beethoven Sonatas
together — his father plays the violin, his
mother the piano — and his father conduct
ing music on the radio from the driver's seat
on long drives.
This weekend, Shaham will take
Beethoven out of the living room and into

the concert hall when he performs
Beethoven's "Violin Concerto" with the
San Francisco Symphony under the direc
tion Michael Tilson Thomas. He's had a
long and happy relationship with the or
chestra. "Michael has been very nice to me
over the years and the orchestra is wonder
ful," he explained.
Shaham says that if forced to choose a fa
vorite piece, the Beethoven violin concer
to"might very well be a candidate. It is so
human, so universally appealing, so pro
found and beautiful. The piece takes you

through an incredible journey, like sitting
through a good story or movie." He says he
is unconcerned with the miserly two or
three rehearsals allotted for the series —
"The orchestra knows the piece backwards
and forwards and hopefully I'll know it as
well," he chuckles.
1 asked Shaham of the changes in his life as
a performer, following the Sept. 11 attacks. "1
was happier then to be a musician than at any
other time." The attacks, he says, "brought
out the best in people. Music became even
more precious than it had been before."
