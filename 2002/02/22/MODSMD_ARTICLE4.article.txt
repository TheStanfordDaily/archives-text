# Stanford ready to welcome parents
## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Parents from all over the world
arrive on the Farm today to join
their children for Stanford's annual
Parents' Weekend.
Sponsored by the Office of the
President and Provost and coordi
nated by University Communica
tions, the weekend is open to par
ents and relatives of all undergrad
uate Stanford students.
"The purpose of the event is to
give parents a taste of undergrad
uate life on campus and to learn
more about the University and the
academic program here," said
Ryan Foley, weekend coordinator.
According to Foley, close to
2,500 family members attended
the event last year. This year's ex
pected turnout is 3,000, about
half of whom are relatives of
freshmen. Foley said that 13
countries and 47 states are ex
pected to be represented.
The weekend kicks off today
with welcome sessions — one for
parents of freshmen and one for
parents of upperclassmen. Follow
ing this greeting, parents can
choose to attend one of the new "Is

sues in Higher Education" pro
grams. The issues that will be ex
amined are admission and financial
aid, athletics, student affairs and
undergraduate education.
University President John Hen
nessy will deliver his annual Par
ents' Weekend address this after
noon and will hold a question-and
answer period.
On both days parents will be
able to experience the rigor of
Stanford's academic curriculum
hands-on through "Back to
School Classes" taught by faculty
and other Stanford community
members. Class titles include "II I
Win, Do You Lose?" and"Letters
and Diaries of Resistance in Fas
cist Germany."
The ethnic community centers,
the LGBT CRC and the Women's
Community Center are hosting re
ceptions tonight. In addition, the
Writing Center will be hosting a
parent / student reading session.
Parents are also invited to dine in
their children's residences to get a
better feel for dorm life.
"I really like to see parents and
students spending time together
and having students take their par
ents to special places on campus or

to communities they're really in
volved in," Foley said.
Another event targeted towards
students and parents is "Making
Choices," a series of two presenta
tions on how students should go
about choosing a career.
"I think that the last time par
ents were here was orientation, so
this gives them a chance after their
children get into the swing of edu
cation at Stanford to see that
things are well," said Christine

McBrady, president of t he Stan
ford's Parents' Club.
Campus tours will be ottered on
Saturday for parents who may have
missed them during orientation.
Saturday afternoon, the Par
ents' Club will host the annual "En
tertainment Extravaganza!" at
Memorial Auditorium. The show
will feature the Stanford Steppers,
Fleet Street Singers, Stanford Har

monics and Stanford Taiko.
Following the performances,
parents will have a chance to enjoy
refreshments and tour the new
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter at a reception hosted by the Par
ents' Club.
"I think it's a good time for par
ents to get to know each other and
to meet new parents, especially
from out of town and out of state,"
Mcßrady said.
Freshman Connie Chan was ea
gerly awaiting her parents' arrival.
"I'm really excited that I will
get to see my parents and show
them the things I've been work
ing on," Chan said. "I want them
to like my friends and dorm
mates, and I hope they enjoy
their time here."
