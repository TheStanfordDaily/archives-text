# 'Shiri' a brutally incisive action flick
## 
### JUNG LAH 
The new wave of Korean cinema is some
thing to get excited about, and if you've
never seen a Korean film before, "Shiri" is a
good place to start. Currently playing in San
Francisco fora limited U.S. theatrical re
lease, "Shiri" has been out since 1999, when
it broke Korean box office records for ticket

sales, going on to
win honors at
Korean awards
ceremonies for
Best Actor and
Best Picture.

of Korea, acting as a metaphor for the ten-

sion and hope existing between
North and South Korea with re
gard to reunification. The film
emphasizes character develop
ment to draw on this historical /
political backdrop, allowing it to
rise above standard action-block
buster fare. Add in a whole lot of
plot, essential bursts of ultra-vio-

lence, excellent direc
tion and an above-aver
age cast of actors, and
you've got yourself a pic
ture that both chal
lenges and entertains.
Made for only $5 mil-

lion, its effects still rival
that of the bloated mega-budget
movies churned out by the Hol-

lywood machine. "Shiri" opens with a mon
tage of sequences spanning multiple years
that depict the training of the elite North
Korean Bth Special Forces. These scenes
quickly set a somewhat violent tone for the
rest of the film.
Hee, a female secret agent and unparal
leled marksman, dispatches POWs during
her training by smashing their bloodied
heads into concrete walls. She sneaks up on
them in grass fields to slit their throats and
unloads bullets at their faces at point-blank
range. She also demonstrates an uncanny
ability to lire a sniper bullet between the
third and fourth vertebrae of a moving
human target, effectively killing the said tar
get in the most efficient manner possible.


Shoofing a bullet between John Woo's vertebrae
All of this is done with cold ellicient:y. "Shiri" goes fora
new kind of brutal realism, where body parts get shot off
and bodies explode graphically in real-time.
The heart of the movie focuses on Ryu (well-known Ko
rean actor Han Suk-Gyu) and Lee (Sung Kang-Ho), secret
agent partners from South Korea who are trying to track
clown the elusive Hee.
However, the film's action elements are nicely coun
tered with the development of a love story between Ryu
and Hyun (Kim Yoon-Jin), the owner of a local fish shop.
The lovers' quiet moments of dialogue range from fish
care to every-day domestic issues, lending a touch of real
ism and tenderness to offset Ryu's otherwise automatic
weapon-filled existence.
Unlike typical action films whose romantic subplots seem
contrived and tacked on, the romance of "Shiri" is actually
quite essential to the narrative, fleshing out the motivations
and actions of various characters throughout the progres

sion of the movie.
Another of the film's highlights is Choi Min Sik's excel
lent portrayal of the North Korean special forces leader
Park, whose role as the film's terrorist "villain" is not so clear
when given the circumstances his fellow North Korean citi-

Zens are in.
In one of the film's best scenes, Park
describes the economic disparity be
tween the two halves of the Korean
Peninsula, with a focused "Have you
ever seen parents eat the flesh of their
dead children? With hamburgers and
Coke, you wouldn't know."
Of course, the film climaxes in the
inevitable gun showdown between
Ryu and Hee. But "Shiri's" success is
grounded in the intelligent way it de
picts reunification, an extremely

salient and pressing issue for Korean people at present.
Viewers with no background in modern Korean history
may not find the plot line as engaging as others. Nonethe
less, "Shiri" is still recommended for those who crave smart
storytelling in their action films.
