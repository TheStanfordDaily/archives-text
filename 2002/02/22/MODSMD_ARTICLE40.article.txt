### JUNG LAH 
The new wave of Korean cinema is some
thing to get excited about, and if you've
never seen a Korean film before, "Shiri" is a
good place to start. Currently playing in San
Francisco fora limited U.S. theatrical re
lease, "Shiri" has been out since 1999, when
it broke Korean box office records for ticket

sales, going on to
win honors at
Korean awards
ceremonies for
Best Actor and
Best Picture.

sion and hope existing between
North and South Korea with re
gard to reunification. The film
emphasizes character develop
ment to draw on this historical /
political backdrop, allowing it to
rise above standard action-block
buster fare. Add in a whole lot of
plot, essential bursts of ultra-vio-

lence, excellent direc
tion and an above-aver
age cast of actors, and
you've got yourself a pic
ture that both chal
lenges and entertains.
Made for only $5 mil-

lion, its effects still rival
that of the bloated mega-budget
movies churned out by the Hol-

lywood machine. "Shiri" opens with a mon
tage of sequences spanning multiple years
that depict the training of the elite North
Korean Bth Special Forces. These scenes
quickly set a somewhat violent tone for the
rest of the film.
Hee, a female secret agent and unparal
leled marksman, dispatches POWs during
her training by smashing their bloodied
heads into concrete walls. She sneaks up on
them in grass fields to slit their throats and
unloads bullets at their faces at point-blank
range. She also demonstrates an uncanny
ability to lire a sniper bullet between the
third and fourth vertebrae of a moving
human target, effectively killing the said tar
get in the most efficient manner possible.
