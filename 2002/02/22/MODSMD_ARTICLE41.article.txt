# 'Hart's War' definitely no 'Dirty Dozen'

Start warming up the Colonel Klink impressions, boys and
girls — there's a POW-camp movie in theaters! Just when
yoti thought Hollywood had expelled the word "stalag" from
its vocabulary, some oh-so-prescient big-studio producer has
trucked out "Hart's War" to satisfy our eternal longing for pa

triotism and pedantry. God bless this country.
Now, 1 expect that the prospect of a re-hashed jumble of
World War II cliches engenders as much excitement in most
of you as the fantasy that Andrew McCarthy might take a risk
and return for "Mannequin 3." If you happen to be one of
these skeptics, I have a simple exercise for you: name a bad

POW-camp movie (if you can't think of one,
just imagine "Stripes" with a few stalags).
I'll help you out — it can't be done! You
can't make a bad movie about a POW
camp. I can't explain it. It'sjust one of those
things — kind of like how Brad Pitt can't
make a bad movie and Jerry O'Connell

can't make a good movie. Well, that one's a little more un
derstandable.
True to form, "Hart's War" is not a bad movie. It gets solid
performances from Bruce Willis and other and solid direc
tion from Billy Joe Tolliver-esque veteran Gregory Hoblit. It
even boasts a few good dramatic moments where hardened,
yet plucky Americans stare clown hardened and thoroughly
evil Nazis.
Tearing at the roots of this film, however, are two brutally
fatal flaws. If you are going to make a POW-camp movie,
there are two cardinal sins you can't commit, and this movie

Dir. Gregory Hoblit I
MGM Pictures Cg /l-l^

commits them both.
First, you need a crazy cast of characters engaging in wild
shenanigans around the camp. The prisoners in this movie
seem kind of upset that they're stuck at the camp. It's totally
implausible! Where's Steve McQueen chucking the baseball
against the wall in the cooler? Or Animal and his little buddy

trying to sneak into the female prisoners'
shower? That kind of sophomoric fun is
essential to a POW-camp movie. The for
mula falls apart without it.
Second, the escape here is like an af
terthought. You never see the Ameri
cans planning it. The Germans never

get close to uncovering it. There's so much going on in
the camp that by the time they get around to escaping,
you feel kind of upset that they're trying to leave. The es
cape is the backbone of any good POW-camp flick. The
escape is the dirty little secret in "Hart's War." It's a com
plete catastrophe.
All in all, I don't think people are going to be disap
pointed by "Hart's War," but they're probably not going to
be cheering when the credits roll either. If you're really
hard-up for violence and nationalistic fervor these days,
check-out the biathlon.
