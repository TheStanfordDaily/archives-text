# 'John Q': Feel-good crap for the masses
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
"John Q" is about a poor black man who
takes on the rich white world and, because he
carries a gun and looks like Denzel Washing
ton, of course succeeds.
This is the type of sappy action picture
where the melodrama and sap are cranked
up and the action is too silly to consider plau
sible. How sappy and how melodramatic is

it? Oh, if the folks at Hall
mark could, they would
make the movie into their
own greeting card.
Washington stars as the
title character, one of those
underdog heroes who would

o
be more likeable if every line of dialogue didn't
keep reminding lis he's the underdog. But
never mind. The point is, John Q. Archibald is
a g(xxl man. He works in a Chicago factory to
take care of his wife Denise (Kimberly Wise)
and 10-year old son Michael (Daniel E. Smith).

They're all happy, and sing and smile and
thumb-wrestle even after their car is repos
sessed. Then they go to church and sing
some more. "John Q" gives us one of those
obligatory made-for-TV family struggles,
where Michael collapses on the baseball field
and needs a heart transplant. The problem
is, insurance won't cover the procedure.
Then we get the scene where the hospital
surgeon (James Woods) tells the couple their

son needs the operation to
survive and the hospital fi
nancial manager (Anne
Heche, who plays a char
acter aptly named Rebecca
Payne) tells them they
don't have the money to

get Michael's name on the donor list. So John
Q. decides to take the patients in the emer
gency room hostage. His demand is that his
son be put on the donor list.
The material might have worked if written
straight. Yet "John Q" fails because it's too

worried about Washington's image.
He's a good guy and so lie befriends all
of his hostages. The sony screenplay is
also dotted with tired exchanges be
tween John Q. and a veteran hostage
negotiator (Robert Duvall).
In a movie like this, I'm usually in
clined to say that the performances
need to be dialed down. But with
"John Q," every performance is di
aled in a different direction. Wash
ington goes through so many charac
ter shifts — from mad to merry and
angry to amused — that his charac
ter resembles someone with multi
ple-personality disorder.
Heche is supposed to be bitchy,

which is tine, but the screenplay crosses the
lines of bitchiness. She's more of a caricature
than a character. And as for Duvall, he paces
back and forth like a senior citizen with indi
gestion who just wants to go home and watch
"Wheel of Fortune."

If the movie has a message, it's that the
health-care system needs to he reformed. That
may be true. Yet "John Q" is pretty light
turkey to have such a deep social statement. It
needed a reformed screenplay before it tried
to reform America.
