# Hare's 'Room' blissful, poignant
## 
### SIERRA MILLMAN 
A moment of passion between two strangers sets off a round
of sexual liaisons in the West Coast premiere of David Hare's
"The Blue Room." An update of Arthur Schnitzler's provoca
tive "La Ronde," the play offers 10 brief encounters between
men and women who seek satisfaction in moments, only to re
alize, sooner or later, that isolated moments of pleasure will nei
ther last nor fully satisfy'.
A girl encotirages a cab driver's interest, hoping the mo
ment will mature into a lasting relationship. An inconsiderate
visitor suspends a student's almost-successful seduction of the
family au pair. A playwright, wise to life's game, chooses the

words to say good-bye to a model even
as he worships her body. These lovers
flirt, laugh, argue, cry and, in between
the sheets, consider the trials of
monogamy, the intoxicating temptation
of new romance and the insatiable ap
petite of desire.
The Theatre at San Pedro Square's
production in San Jose features a small

theater's intimate atmosphere, at 1 alluring set, an innovative di
rector and two charismatic performers who take on all the
roles. In this performance, Hare's tribute to Schnitzler is
poignant, tender, funny, thrilling and real.
At the back of.the stage, bathed in blue light, stands a trans
parent temporary wall llanked by two doors through which the
actors continuously enter and exit. Subtle, yet striking, light
and sound effects and versatile props come together to create
a sense of mood and place — now an urban street scene, then

an expensive hotel room, later a famous actress's boudoir. A
projected image at the wall's center resembles an x-ray of an
apple's interior or a human heart, a static representation of the
characters' tumultuous urges.
The set and staging demonstrate director Michael Butler's
and the designers' thorough appreciation of the possibilities
and limitations of the space. 'Hie stage can never entirely fade
to black because the actors must rearrange the props at the
close of each act. Retreating through their respective doors,
they change clothing and hair in enthusiastic silhouette.
Every movement has been purposefully and effectively
choreographed to an eclectic soundtrack that intensifies the
sexual tension between the lovers and quickens the

evening's pace. The scenes between the
scenes could not be more exciting.
French au pair, Scottish playwright, Ameri
can model, British aristocrat —no part, it
seems, can prove too challenging for Bay Area
regulars Stephanie Gularte and Jonathan
Rhys Williams, actors set apart by their com
mand of vocal and physical technique and the
sincerity and ferocity with which they rein-

vent parts originated by Nicole Kidman and lain Glenn.
Williams lends his rich vocals to a song that explores the
meaning of "The Blue Room." The moment when two people
find one another, find bliss in a kiss, an embrace, the moment
when the world falls away — the blue room is the black out be
tween this moment and the next, the realization simultaneous
with the consummation of loss and a futile effort to recapture
the already fast fading memory of perfection. Don't miss the
chance of bliss in"The Blue Room."
