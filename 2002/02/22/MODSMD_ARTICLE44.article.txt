# Enjoy a sexy 'Late Night' date
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
Richard Hawley's delicate debut album,
"Late Night Final," is perfect for the ride
home after a drive-in movie. An odd but
successful mix of '50s-style vocals with new
age folk, Brit pop and even hints of coun
try, these 11 songs will appeal to the "quiet
is the new loud" audience that Nick Drake
fathered back in the '70s.
Hawley released track two, "Baby, You're
My Light," as the album's first single. Ar
guably the record's best, this song boasts the
album's catchiest guitar riff and encapsulates
its warmth. Like many of the songs, this one
features a well-used pedal steel guitar that

parallels the emotional
highs and lows of Haw
ley's music.
The songwriter's
heartfelt lyrics are
showcased on this
love song: "Last time,
years are gone, the

moment's on, you know it. But I believe in
you, and I will show it. As life goes on you
know you don't have to hate all you (ind.
Baby, you're my light."
Other highlights include the '50s throw
back "No Way Home" and the new-agey
"Precious Sight." The former, the album's
most upbeat track, shows ofl Hawley's Roy

Orbison-like vocals,
while the latter is the
best cocktail lounge
song to hit contempo
rary airwaves.
Engl an d' s
latest singer / song
writer began as the
guitar man for the
indie band Longpigs
and has an accom
plished session list
that includes Pulp
and, most recently,
Beth Orton. His solo
work is no less im
pressive. Out on Se
tanta Records, these
eleven songs, which
are a follow-up to
the mini-album he
released last year,
will no doubt occupy

Late Night Final

h. itkirCrti .*

Discmans on countless
late-night walks.
A son of a Sheffield, Eng
land, steelworker, Hawley's
unglamorous songs at
tempt to capture the heart
break of the barroom
loner. However, though

this music remains mellow and methodical, it
isn't sad. At his best, Hawley will produce
goose bumps and prompt slow dances, but

he won't evoke tears or
binge drinking.
The Englishman
pens simple songs. His
crooning vocals over
airy, almost ambient
guitars and soft piano
create a mood so ro
mantic they put to
shame the atmosphere
of a walk on the beach
following a candle-lit
sorbet dessert.
Though Hawley has
settled on a refreshingly
honest and somewhat
hip sound, his music
suffers from repetition
and remains unremark
able. Each song blends
into the next, and when
the music is as slow and
eerie as Hawley's is, the
end result sounds
forced and tedious. De
spite his warm, lounge
like vocals, Hawley's
singing lacks the charm

and emotional charge that characterized
Sinatra.
"Late Night Final" will likely frustrate
many, as Hawley hasn't realized the full
potential of these songs. Less accessible
than his peers, Hawley will not attract
crossover fans. Mildly interested listeners
should start with Drake and move to Mor
rissey before Hawley. However, alterna
tive singer / songwriter devotees have
found a new torchbearer.


How sensitive! He lives in a warehouse!
