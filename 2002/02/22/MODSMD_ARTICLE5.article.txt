### ANNA GALAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel of 13 students discussed
interracial dating last night as part
of the Hapa Issues Forum. Stu
dents expressed a diverse range of
viewpoints, raising controversial is
sues such as societal, family and
community expectations, as well as
relationships and marriage.
Senior Brian Laing introduced
the group by stressing the need for
communication and cooperation
between ethnic groups on campus,
citing their lack of interaction with
each other.

reactions they received when they
brought home someone of a differ
ent race to meet their families.
"Even though it's hypocritical of
him, my dad would be upset if I
came home with a white guy," said
sophomore Diana Banks, who de
scribed herself as Korean, black
and Native American.
Banks brought up the issue of
black men getting upset when
black women date outside their
race. The discussion turned into a
debate when Leora Cavazos, a ju
nior, mentioned her experiences
as a Latina.
"If I'm holding hands with a
male friend of mine that is black, 1
will get dirty looks from black fe
males," she said.
