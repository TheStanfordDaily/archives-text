# Panel on interracial dating sees challenges
## 
### ANNA GALAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel of 13 students discussed
interracial dating last night as part
of the Hapa Issues Forum. Stu
dents expressed a diverse range of
viewpoints, raising controversial is
sues such as societal, family and
community expectations, as well as
relationships and marriage.
Senior Brian Laing introduced
the group by stressing the need for
communication and cooperation
between ethnic groups on campus,
citing their lack of interaction with
each other.
"Although interracial dating is
more commonplace these days,
there are still issues that need to be
worked out," Laing said.
He mentioned that interracial
dating is a relatively recent phe
nomenon since anti-miscegenation
laws were only abolished in 1968.
Before this time, it was generally il
legal for couples of different races
to be married in the United States.
The panelists introduced them
selves, noting their year, major,
ethnic background, dating history
and current dating situation.
The first question was an expla
nation of the obstacles and prob
lems that the panelists had faced
with regards to interracial dating
or mixed racial backgrounds.
Junior Ming Wong talked about

how at times, people will date
someone of another race expecting
them to be a representation of the
entire race. These people some
times are surprised when the other
person does not lit the stereotype.
Junior Percy Ballard men
tioned the importance of cultural
issues when dating someone of an
other race, citing the relevance of
how an individual was raised and
the type of culture the person was
used to.
Panelists also discussed the ex
pectations of their families and the
reactions they received when they
brought home someone of a differ
ent race to meet their families.
"Even though it's hypocritical of
him, my dad would be upset if I
came home with a white guy," said
sophomore Diana Banks, who de
scribed herself as Korean, black
and Native American.
Banks brought up the issue of
black men getting upset when
black women date outside their
race. The discussion turned into a
debate when Leora Cavazos, a ju
nior, mentioned her experiences
as a Latina.
"If I'm holding hands with a
male friend of mine that is black, 1
will get dirty looks from black fe
males," she said.
The issue was discussed fur-
ther by Banks and Cavazos, with
other panelists contributing their
opinions. Banks explained that
the reason that Cavazos had re
ceived dirty looks was not because
of her behavior but because many
black women are constantly fight
ing the media's image that black
women are not attractive.
"There can be a lot of anger
when you see a black man with a
woman that is not black. It is almost
as if you feel personally rejected,"
she said.
According to Banks, this feeling
is more a reflection of the way that
black women can feel about them
selves and not something that
people of other races are doing.
She stressed that the media's por
trayal of black women was a mis

representation and that it led to
some of these current problems
between races.
Other panelists noted that in a
small dating pool, there can be
some bitterness of those who do
not date frequently. For exam
ple, Asian women commonly date
outside their race, as do black
men, while it is rare that Asian
men and black women date out
side their race.
Wong said that while the discus
sion regarding bitterness was a
good explanation for the behavior
of different racial groups, it was not
a justification of their actions. He
said there are times when one must
simply accept the circumstances of
a situation.
Ballard said dating outside his
race in high school made him ap
preciate the positive attributes of
dating within his race.
The discussion closed by com
ing to a consensus that there were

still many issues to be discussed and
that the issue of interracial dating
was complex.
"[The forum] exceeded our ex
pectations, and it was good that
people were able to articulate the
controversial issues so well," said
Idling. "That will hopefully spark a
continued dialogue."
Student reaction was over
whelmingly positive.
"Most everyone enjoyed it and
there were many diverse perspec
tives," said junior Amanda Rang.
"It just shows yon how complex
the issue is and how it is a taboo
subject. But hopefully through
discussion we are breaking down
those walls."
According to forum organizers,
these issues can be discussed fur
ther in one-unit seminars about
race.
Four seminars are being offered
this quarter and eight are planned
for spring quarter.

A panel of 13 students discussed
interracial dating last night as part
of the Hapa Issues Forum. Stu
dents expressed a diverse range of
viewpoints, raising controversial is
sues such as societal, family and
community expectations, as well as
relationships and marriage.
Senior Brian Laing introduced
the group by stressing the need for
communication and cooperation
between ethnic groups on campus,
citing their lack of interaction with
each other.
"Although interracial dating is
more commonplace these days,
there are still issues that need to be
worked out," Laing said.
He mentioned that interracial
dating is a relatively recent phe
nomenon since anti-miscegenation
laws were only abolished in 1968.
Before this time, it was generally il
legal for couples of different races
to be married in the United States.
The panelists introduced them
selves, noting their year, major,
ethnic background, dating history
and current dating situation.
The first question was an expla
nation of the obstacles and prob
lems that the panelists had faced
with regards to interracial dating
or mixed racial backgrounds.
Junior Ming Wong talked about

how at times, people will date
someone of another race expecting
them to be a representation of the
entire race. These people some
times are surprised when the other
person does not lit the stereotype.
Junior Percy Ballard men
tioned the importance of cultural
issues when dating someone of an
other race, citing the relevance of
how an individual was raised and
the type of culture the person was
used to.
Panelists also discussed the ex
pectations of their families and the
reactions they received when they
brought home someone of a differ
ent race to meet their families.
"Even though it's hypocritical of
him, my dad would be upset if I
came home with a white guy," said
sophomore Diana Banks, who de
scribed herself as Korean, black
and Native American.
Banks brought up the issue of
black men getting upset when
black women date outside their
race. The discussion turned into a
debate when Leora Cavazos, a ju
nior, mentioned her experiences
as a Latina.
"If I'm holding hands with a
male friend of mine that is black, 1
will get dirty looks from black fe
males," she said.
The issue was discussed fur-
ther by Banks and Cavazos, with
other panelists contributing their
opinions. Banks explained that
the reason that Cavazos had re
ceived dirty looks was not because
of her behavior but because many
black women are constantly fight
ing the media's image that black
women are not attractive.
"There can be a lot of anger
when you see a black man with a
woman that is not black. It is almost
as if you feel personally rejected,"
she said.
According to Banks, this feeling
is more a reflection of the way that
black women can feel about them
selves and not something that
people of other races are doing.
She stressed that the media's por
trayal of black women was a mis

representation and that it led to
some of these current problems
between races.
Other panelists noted that in a
small dating pool, there can be
some bitterness of those who do
not date frequently. For exam
ple, Asian women commonly date
outside their race, as do black
men, while it is rare that Asian
men and black women date out
side their race.
Wong said that while the discus
sion regarding bitterness was a
good explanation for the behavior
of different racial groups, it was not
a justification of their actions. He
said there are times when one must
simply accept the circumstances of
a situation.
Ballard said dating outside his
race in high school made him ap
preciate the positive attributes of
dating within his race.
The discussion closed by com
ing to a consensus that there were

still many issues to be discussed and
that the issue of interracial dating
was complex.
"[The forum] exceeded our ex
pectations, and it was good that
people were able to articulate the
controversial issues so well," said
Idling. "That will hopefully spark a
continued dialogue."
Student reaction was over
whelmingly positive.
"Most everyone enjoyed it and
there were many diverse perspec
tives," said junior Amanda Rang.
"It just shows yon how complex
the issue is and how it is a taboo
subject. But hopefully through
discussion we are breaking down
those walls."
According to forum organizers,
these issues can be discussed fur
ther in one-unit seminars about
race.
Four seminars are being offered
this quarter and eight are planned
for spring quarter.
