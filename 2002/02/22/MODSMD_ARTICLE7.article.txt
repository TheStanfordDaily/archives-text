### DURANT GIPSON STAFF WRITER 
An exhibit of selections from the col
lection of philosopher Eric Hoffer's pa
pers opens today at 3 p.m. in the lobby
of Hoover Tower with an accompany
ing reception.
I he exhibit, titled, "Eric Hoffer's True
Believer: Manifestations in Mass Move
ments," will last until April 27.
Students in a class from the fresh
man Program in Writing and Rhetoric
chose the items and wrote the accom
panying material.

HofFer was a self-taught philosopher
from San Francisco who was also a visiting
speaker at Stanford. According to the
Hoover Institution Archives, Hotter at
tained national prominence with his 1951
book, "The True Believer: Thoughts on
the Nature of Mass Movements."
For much of his life he worked as a
longshoreman in San Francisco. He wrote
his material during breaks and after work.
After Holler's death, the entire col
lection of his personal papers and rough
drafts was loaned to the Hoover
Archives for safekeeping and the Uni
versity acquired permanent ownership

of them iti 1999.
According to Elena Danielson,
Hoover's director of library and archives,
the collection is "fairly substantial" and
takes up 75 feet of linear shelf space. It in
cludes, papers, photographs, sound
recordings and memoribilia.
"Hotter is a very well-known philoso
pher and social theorist," said Andrea
Lunsford, professor of English and direc
tor of the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric. "The acquisition is a tremen
dous coup for the University," she said.
Lundsford said Hoffer's argument in
"The True Believer" is that people should

be wary of what I Jotter calls the true be
liever, or someone who clings so strongly
to his beliefs that he is unwilling to consid
er other perspectives.
As part of the writing class, "Strategies
of Persausion in Cultural Context,"
taught by Ann Walters, lecturer in the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric, the
students studied propaganda and read
I loffer's "True Believer."
After Watters's discovery that Hoffer's
papers were in the archives, the students
studied this material as well. When the op
portunity came to assemble an exhibit,
they took it.

The writings explore his attempt to
come to grips with the consequences of
"being governed by ideology rather than
reason," Danielson said. They tried to
"link Eric Hoffer's explanation of radical
ism with our recent clash with [it]."
"Just being able to work with primary
archival materials is not something that
undergraduates get to do," freshman Sar
ala Nagala said.
Freshman Jen Chen agreed with
Nagala.
"The chance to look through materials
at the Archives, that aspect was reward
ing," Chen said.
