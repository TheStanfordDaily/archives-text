A robotic pet named "AIBO," a
zero-emissions engine and a re
tractable syringe are just a few of the
innovative products that the top de
sign and manufacturing firms put
on display at the Cool Products
Kxpo, an event held Wednesday at
the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni
Center. The event was sponsored
by the Alliance for Innovative Man
ufacturing and the Graduate
School of Business.

"The expo is a response to the
dot-coms and how you couldn't feel
and touch the products," said sec
ond-year business student and
expo organizer Kim Champion.
"We wanted to bring the business
and engineering sclux>ls together,
but it's for the whole Stanford com
munity to see the products."
The expo was the brainchild of
Dan Ostrower, Greg Lamps and
Dave Lyon, former business stu
dents who organized the first expo
last year.
"Companies came to us to par

ticipate," Champion said. The expo
attracted 30 firms from a wide
range of industries to showcase
their newest products.
According to first-year business
student Melanie Kansil, the
turnout of visitors from the Stan
lord community was as impressive
as the number of companies.
"[lt was a] great turnout, more
people came than we expected,"
Kansil said.
"You never see such a wide
range of industries in the same
place," said first-year business stu
dent Sanam Lari. "This event is in
credible in that sense."
Among the most innovative
product ideas was the zero-emis
sions engine, which will be incorpo
rated into the 2003 Toyota Camry.
According to Toyota's Regulatory
Affairs Manager Ed Bradley, the
Camry will use a charcoal filter and
honeycomb catalyst — similar to a
car's catalytic converter — to re
duce hydrocarbon emissions down
to undetectable levels.
Companies from different
sectors of the design and manu
facturing industry had products
on display.
Intel's Pentium 4 chip running
at 2.2 GII/ went head-to-head with
AMD's Athlon XP 2000 Plus. Both
companies showed the power of
their processors with amazing dis
plays of multimedia applications
and realtime image rendering.
"XBox is one of the coolest prod
ucts out," said Microsoft represen

tative Rohan Bommen.
Bommen was asked about what
was planned for the XBox.
I DEO was another company
that presented its products.
"We are an innovative compa
ny," said I DEO representative
Ade Adekola. "We have clients
and for them we develop things . .
. we helped Handspring develop
PDA phones."
Millennium Jet Inc.'s
Solo Trek XKV, a new type of ver
tical take-off and landing aircraft,
can transport one person in an
upright and standing position,
fhe Sunnyvale based company
claimed its products will offer
low-cost and practical solutions to
numerous military and civilian
transportation challenges.
An innovative syringe by Re
tractable Technologies Inc. will
permit the delivery of drugs to pa
tients while reducing the risk of
transmitting viruses — including
HIV and Hepatitis C — during the
transfer process. The syringe's nee
dle completely retracts at the end of
the delivery process.
A custom-made electric motor
from AC Propulsion will enable the
next generation of electric vehicles
to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in
4.1 seconds. This high-perfor
mance electric sports car, by virtue
of its operating principle, is emis
sions-free.
