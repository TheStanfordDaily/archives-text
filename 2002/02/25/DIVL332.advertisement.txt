Summer @SSE
Some students go home for the
summer, but SSE doesn't quit. Some of
our biggest projects run during
summer quarter, including the Stanford
Directory and the Business Leadership
Program. We offer full and part time
positions on all levels, in several
different areas:
Stanford Directory &
the Unofficial Guide to Stanford
Bike and SSE Kard Sales
the Stanford Store & Online Store
Technology Group
Financial Auditing
Business Leadership Program
The Rest of the Year!
Managers are a diverse group at SSE,
but they all have one thing in common:
learning project management.
Managers take a project from start to
finish: from building a business plan to
meeting their sales goals. Managers will
master business fundamentals:
marketing, accounting, sales, operations,
and leadership.
Associates focus on one area of a
project, usually developing one specific
skill. However, while associates'
responsibilities are specialized, each is
part of a small, interactive team, giving
them an opportunity to learn about the
entire business.
More information and online applications at
http://sse.stanford.edu/jobs
Info Session TONIGHT in Cypress South at 7PM
Director Apps Due WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 27th
Manager & Associate Apps Due FRIDAY, MARCH 15th
Questions? Contact Samantha at
jobs@sse.stanford.edu or 723-3138.
