### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
In honor of its alumni athletes
who have contributed to the
Stanford community, the Stan
ford chapter of Delta Tau Delta is
holding its first annual "Stanford
Delt Legends Golf Classic" tour
nament today.
The proceeds from the
tournament will benefit the
purchase of wrestling mats
for the Boys and Girls Clubs
of America of the Peninsu
la's new wrestling program.
The Delt national philan
thropy program is titled "Adopt-
A-School." Delt chapters across
the nation participate in volun
teer programs that focus on sup
porting a school or school-relat
ed programs.
"In the spirit of this program
we began volunteering with the
Boys and Girls Club of Menlo
Park," said senior Jonathon
Penn, chapter president.
Four Delt alumni who have
distinguished themselves
through their athletic: accom
plishments have been named
honorees for the tournament.

This year's honorees are Don
Bunce, a quarterback for Stan
ford's 1972 Rose Bowl team;
John Sande, a center for Stan
ford's 1971 and 1972 Rose Bowl
teams; John Sande Jr., a snapper
for Stanford's 2000 Rose Bowl
team; and Gene Washington, an
Ail-American and NFL Hall of
Famer and current NFL director
of operations.
The honorees will be joined
by "Delt legends" — other
alumni with athletic accomplish
ments. Todd Husak, a former
Cardinal quarterback and cur
rent Denver Bronco, is one of the
many athletes who will play in the
tournament.
Over 100 golfers will par
ticipate in the tournament.
Each group of four golfers
will be joined by an honoree
or a legend.
Charles Marsala, chapter ad
visor, told the Palo Alto Daily
News that the tournament "pro
vides the alumni and the chapter
the opportunity to work for the
community, especially the Boys
and Girls Club, where many vol
unteer independently."
" Fhe golf tournament is a re
ally easy way to get the communi
ty at large involved fora good
cause," said sophomore Sean Za
harakes, member of the chapter's
philanthropy and golf commit
tees. "We wanted to involve a

large percent of Delt alumni in
the area, and since golf is a wide
ly played sport, it seemed the
most reasonable way to create in
terest," Zaharakes said.
No current Delt members will
play in the tournament. They
will be running the various activ
ities and helping out with the ad
ministrative aspects of the tour
nament. However, they are look
ing forward to it.
"It's exciting to start a tradi
tion that benefits a great cause
and that brings so many people
together," Penn said. " Four years
from now, 1 expect this [tourna
ment] to be a nationally recog
nized event. It makes me proud
to leave a legacy at Stanford."
The fraternity hopes to raise
nearly $30,000 from the tour
nament, not only from dona
tions from the golfers but also
from local businesses that have
either advertised in the pro
gram or have donated items to
be auctioned.
The tournament will begin at
9:00 a.m. and end at 4:00 p.m. A
reception will follow the tourna
ment, which Dean of Students
Marc Wais and Assistant Dean
of Students and Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe will
attend. The clay will culminate
with an awards dinner at 6:00
p.m., at which the honorees will
