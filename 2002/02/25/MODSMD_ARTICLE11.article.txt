## The 						Stanford Daily Graduate fellowships should be increased 
### 
Published Since 1891

Graduate students are important
members of the Stanford commu
nity. They staff laboratories, teach
undergraduate classes, advise un
dergraduates and enhance Stanford's reputa
tion with their research successes. They are
both students and employees — highly skilled
employees. As such, they deserve a living wage
as much as Stanford's other workers do.
In January the Graduate Student Council
issued a report on the quality of life of grad
uate students at Stanford. Lack of decent
housing, health care costs and child care
costs were areas of particular concern for
graduate students.
The lack of sufficient on-campus housing and
the rising costs of living off-campus have com
bined to make dignified survival a difficult task
for many graduate students. Some students de
vote so much of their income to paying the
monthly rent that other expenditures often fall
by the wayside. In the survey, one student re
ported having to forego regular dental check
ups because the cost was prohibitive. Others

were forced to commute 80 minutes to campus
every day or to take on part-time or summer
jobs.
Because this area is so unaffordable, the
survey reports that many graduate students
spend a good portion of their days worrying
about how to pay their bills or where they are
going to live next year. Students with such
worries cannot focus on their true work:
studying, researching and teaching.
The University has tried to remedy the un
affordability of local housing with stipends of
$ 100 or $200 per month. These programs are
good ideas, but they do not really help solve
the problem; the money does not stretch very
far when the average off-campus apartment
costs at least ten times that figure.
Health care is no better. Cardinal Care,
while relatively affordable as far as insurance
goes, is not utilized by some graduate stu
dents because it would eat up an additional 10
percent of their fellowship.
Graduate students should be able to afford
decent accommodations, basic healthcare and

child care without having to take on excessive
debt. Many of these students teach or TA for
undergraduate classes or work as research as
sistants with faculty. They are not only students
but also workers who deserve a living wage. If
a living wage in this area is $ 10.10 per hour —
as the University recently agreed it is — and
the working year that that figure is based on is
comprised of 2000 hours, then the minimum
living wage is $20,200.
With the median 50 percent of graduate
students at Stanford earning between
$ 12,000 and $24,000 per year, much of which
comes from non-Stanford income, it is clear
that many of these students fall below what
the University has outlined as its minimum
living wage for unskilled workers.
The fellowships of graduate students, who
have gone through years of training and
work long hours researching and teaching at
the University, should at least be on a par with
the minimum living wage for the area. Stan
ford has an obligation to not only the visibly
poor workers at the University, but also to the

invisibly poor workers — those who carry a
debt load of between 41 percent and 66 per
cent of their annual income and forego regu
lar medical check-ups.
At other universities, graduate students
have had to resort to drastic measures to have
their demands heard. At the University of Illi
nois Urbana-Champaign, graduate students
went on strike for two days because of poor liv
ing conditions. We hope that at Stanford, the
situation does not get so dire.
When many people at this University —
some of whom have undergone 10 years of aca
demic training — are having serious trouble
making ends meet, something has gone grave
ly wrong. We urge the University to consider
significantly raising graduate fellowships
across the board — and especially those at the
lower end of the spectrum — in order to im
prove the living conditions of graduate stu
dents. Doing so would go a long way toward
solving the problems of housing, child care
and health care, and therefore the graduate
students' quality of life.

Graduate students should be able to afford
decent accommodations, basic healthcare and

child care without having to take on excessive
debt. Many of these students teach or TA for
undergraduate classes or work as research as
sistants with faculty. They are not only students
but also workers who deserve a living wage. If
a living wage in this area is $ 10.10 per hour —
as the University recently agreed it is — and
the working year that that figure is based on is
comprised of 2000 hours, then the minimum
living wage is $20,200.
With the median 50 percent of graduate
students at Stanford earning between
$ 12,000 and $24,000 per year, much of which
comes from non-Stanford income, it is clear
that many of these students fall below what
the University has outlined as its minimum
living wage for unskilled workers.
The fellowships of graduate students, who
have gone through years of training and
work long hours researching and teaching at
the University, should at least be on a par with
the minimum living wage for the area. Stan
ford has an obligation to not only the visibly
poor workers at the University, but also to the

invisibly poor workers — those who carry a
debt load of between 41 percent and 66 per
cent of their annual income and forego regu
lar medical check-ups.
At other universities, graduate students
have had to resort to drastic measures to have
their demands heard. At the University of Illi
nois Urbana-Champaign, graduate students
went on strike for two days because of poor liv
ing conditions. We hope that at Stanford, the
situation does not get so dire.
When many people at this University —
some of whom have undergone 10 years of aca
demic training — are having serious trouble
making ends meet, something has gone grave
ly wrong. We urge the University to consider
significantly raising graduate fellowships
across the board — and especially those at the
lower end of the spectrum — in order to im
prove the living conditions of graduate stu
dents. Doing so would go a long way toward
solving the problems of housing, child care
and health care, and therefore the graduate
students' quality of life.
