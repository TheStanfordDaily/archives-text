# DISORDERS NORMAL?
## Time to examine ourselves 
### JEN WEKSELBAUM STAFF COLUMNIST 
We've all heard it before: the
Cowell people come into your
freshman dorm, do a little
song and dance about the
warning signs for anorexia, pass out some
handouts on healthy eating. And that's it.
You are now officially enlightened, aware of
eating disorders and how to spot them.
Twenty minutes later you're sitting in the
dining hall, listening to the girls across the
table argue about which one of them is fat
ter, which one deserves to eat those remain
ing french fries. They may be scary-thin,
pudgy, obese or just "normal." But they are
battling over those Stern Dining french fries
as if their lives depended on it. Our lives, 1
should say. 1 was one of those girls.
It's estimated that 10 percent of college
students struggle with eating disorders, but
I'm not gonna bore you with those stats all
over again. They are striking, but they don't
begin to describe the problem. What they
don't convey is the mentality of disordered
eating. I have to admit, I can't attempt to
convey that to you either. All 1 can offer is
one person's experience. Maybe you will
recognize some of the feelings.
I am too fat. I am worthless. Everyone
is staring at me wherever I go, wondering
who gave me permission to be alive, I am
so hideous. My dormmates are watching
me eat, measuring each bite, and frown
ing upon it because I am already too fat to
eat today. And even worse, I am sure that
everyone else judges their own worth by
their weight too — but duh, they're not fat
like me, so that's why they're happy.
It's the all-encompassing quality of the
obsession that makes it so hard to admit. I
am taking a calculus midterm, talking on
the phone, getting ready for bed ... but
my mind is elsewhere. All that time I am
thinking, what did I eat today? Was it justi
fied? I am adding up the calories, planning
my next trip to the grocery store so I can
stock up on grapefruit... or mushrooms,
or cucumbers — whatever low-calorie
food I've decided to indulge in this week.
But that's just life, what could be
wrong? It makes total sense. I could write
a proof fora logic class: I am fat. Boys
won't date me if I'm fat. My family isn't
proud of me if I'm fat. I can't have friends
if I'm fat. I can't have sex if I 'm fat. I can't
go swimming if I'm fat. I can't ... I can't
. . . do anything, it seems. Therefore, all I
can do is diet and exercise, and wait to be
thin, and then my happy life can begin.
There are all the reasons in the world
why I should obsess about food.
I know what you're thinking. When I
hear someone crying boohoo about an eat
ing disorder, I think, jeez, there are bombs
flying in Afghanistan and children slaving
away in sweatshops! And you're sitting
around worrying about having t<x) much
food? It seems so self-centered, so ridicii

lows. I read a newspaper article last year
which proclaimed that China had finally
come of age economically; they were now
starting to encounter anorexia in the pop
ulation. What a luxury to be able to worry
about disordered eating!
It's madness. We're sitting here, engag
ing in this highly logical-yet-irrational self
starvation, self-stuffing, self-induced vom
iting, and all other manner of self-defeat
ing lifestyles. So what the hell is going on?
I think the key word there is "sell."
The education I've seen about eating
disorders focuses on the symptoms, conse
quences, and treatment for the individual.
We're told, if you've got a problem, you
need to get treatment. But that just
doesn't cut it.
Don't get me wrong — eating disor
ders tan be serious medical problems, and
deserve serious attention and treatment.
But we're getting off the hook too easy if
we just watch out for our friends and get
them treatment if they're not eating.
Nothing is gonna change so long as our
party fliers keep advertising "NO FAT
CHICKS ALLOWED."
Yes, that was a real flier. And that's the
message we give and receive, in subtle and
not-so-subtle ways every day. So if thin is
what my peers define as sexy, if thin is
what will make me a good person, then
damnit, I'm gonna need to get skinny.
But it's true what they say, it's not real
ly our fault as individuals. We're a product
of our society. We've all heard about dis
torted media images. We know there are
humongous industries that profit from
our insecurities about our bodies. And
maybe we can't change those things right
now hut we do have control over our own
actions. We c an recognize that those mod
els are airbrushed, and that no real
women could ever look that perfect.
That's a start, hut I challenge us to go
one step further. What if we looked at those
models and decided that they weren't per
fection? What if each person were to decide
on his or her own standard ol attractiveness
without social pressure? And it's not just
about body image — what if we could carry
this idea throughout our lives, and choos
ing paths for ourselves without pressure to
attain a certain standard of "success?"
Lots of people are working to prevent
and heal eating disorders on this campus.

It's estimated that 10 percent of college
students struggle with eating disorders, but
I'm not gonna bore you with those stats all
over again. They are striking, but they don't
begin to describe the problem. What they
don't convey is the mentality of disordered
eating. I have to admit, I can't attempt to
convey that to you either. All 1 can offer is
one person's experience. Maybe you will
recognize some of the feelings.
I am too fat. I am worthless. Everyone
is staring at me wherever I go, wondering
who gave me permission to be alive, I am
so hideous. My dormmates are watching
me eat, measuring each bite, and frown
ing upon it because I am already too fat to
eat today. And even worse, I am sure that
everyone else judges their own worth by
their weight too — but duh, they're not fat
like me, so that's why they're happy.
It's the all-encompassing quality of the
obsession that makes it so hard to admit. I
am taking a calculus midterm, talking on
the phone, getting ready for bed ... but
my mind is elsewhere. All that time I am
thinking, what did I eat today? Was it justi
fied? I am adding up the calories, planning
my next trip to the grocery store so I can
stock up on grapefruit... or mushrooms,
or cucumbers — whatever low-calorie
food I've decided to indulge in this week.
But that's just life, what could be
wrong? It makes total sense. I could write
a proof fora logic class: I am fat. Boys
won't date me if I'm fat. My family isn't
proud of me if I'm fat. I can't have friends
if I'm fat. I can't have sex if I 'm fat. I can't
go swimming if I'm fat. I can't ... I can't
. . . do anything, it seems. Therefore, all I
can do is diet and exercise, and wait to be
thin, and then my happy life can begin.
There are all the reasons in the world
why I should obsess about food.
I know what you're thinking. When I
hear someone crying boohoo about an eat
ing disorder, I think, jeez, there are bombs
flying in Afghanistan and children slaving
away in sweatshops! And you're sitting
around worrying about having t<x) much
food? It seems so self-centered, so ridicii

lows. I read a newspaper article last year
which proclaimed that China had finally
come of age economically; they were now
starting to encounter anorexia in the pop
ulation. What a luxury to be able to worry
about disordered eating!
It's madness. We're sitting here, engag
ing in this highly logical-yet-irrational self
starvation, self-stuffing, self-induced vom
iting, and all other manner of self-defeat
ing lifestyles. So what the hell is going on?
I think the key word there is "sell."
The education I've seen about eating
disorders focuses on the symptoms, conse
quences, and treatment for the individual.
We're told, if you've got a problem, you
need to get treatment. But that just
doesn't cut it.
Don't get me wrong — eating disor
ders tan be serious medical problems, and
deserve serious attention and treatment.
But we're getting off the hook too easy if
we just watch out for our friends and get
them treatment if they're not eating.
Nothing is gonna change so long as our
party fliers keep advertising "NO FAT
CHICKS ALLOWED."
Yes, that was a real flier. And that's the
message we give and receive, in subtle and
not-so-subtle ways every day. So if thin is
what my peers define as sexy, if thin is
what will make me a good person, then
damnit, I'm gonna need to get skinny.
But it's true what they say, it's not real
ly our fault as individuals. We're a product
of our society. We've all heard about dis
torted media images. We know there are
humongous industries that profit from
our insecurities about our bodies. And
maybe we can't change those things right
now hut we do have control over our own
actions. We c an recognize that those mod
els are airbrushed, and that no real
women could ever look that perfect.
That's a start, hut I challenge us to go
one step further. What if we looked at those
models and decided that they weren't per
fection? What if each person were to decide
on his or her own standard ol attractiveness
without social pressure? And it's not just
about body image — what if we could carry
this idea throughout our lives, and choos
ing paths for ourselves without pressure to
attain a certain standard of "success?"
Lots of people are working to prevent
and heal eating disorders on this campus.

This week the Disordered Eating Edu
cation and Prevention Counc il is also pre
senting a week of events entitled "Listen to
Your Body." But things won't change if
these events only draw the aware and con
vet ted. So come on, c heck it out. Most im
portantly, check yourselfout.

Jen Wek.se!fmim is on undeclared senior. The
registrar is on her tail, lint really, she is me
chanical engineering. She says: "Roger, /
ftrotni.se I'll declare lr\ next week."
We've all heard it before: the
Cowell people come into your
freshman dorm, do a little
song and dance about the
warning signs for anorexia, pass out some
handouts on healthy eating. And that's it.
You are now officially enlightened, aware of
eating disorders and how to spot them.
Twenty minutes later you're sitting in the
dining hall, listening to the girls across the
table argue about which one of them is fat
ter, which one deserves to eat those remain
ing french fries. They may be scary-thin,
pudgy, obese or just "normal." But they are
battling over those Stern Dining french fries
as if their lives depended on it. Our lives, 1
