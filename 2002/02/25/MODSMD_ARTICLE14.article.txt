Stanford does attract prominent speakers
Two weeks ago The Daily printed a Let
ter to the Editor entitled "Stanford Should
Attract Famous Speakers/' The piece was
motivated by the two authors' recent visit to
UC-Berkeley and the lecture recently de
livered there by former President Bill Clin
ton. I'he authors' shared experience left
them asking, "why does Stanford often fail
to attract big name speakers?"
It's a good question. We in the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, as the organization pri
marily responsible for bringing lecturers
here to campus — and obviously sharing in
the authors' desire for visits from promi
nent leaders — thought some words of ex
planation might be in order.
First, Stanford (Clinton notwithstand
ing) has hosted a number of big name
speakers over the past years. Maya Angelou
and F.W. de Klerk were both standouts
from last year's Speakers Bureau lineup
(the first filling Memorial Church and the
second sparking a huge campus dialogue),
and this year's address from former Pak
istani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's gen
erated enough interest to (ill Memorial Au
ditorium — making it the largest Speakers
Bureau event of the past few years. Bhutto
even caught the attention of folks outside of
"the Stanford bubble," drawing all the
major Bay Area news organizations to her
pre-lecture press conference.
Additionally, many other departments
and organizations on campus have been able
to present their share of "big names,"
though their events may have been less pub
licized or restricted to the general public.
The Law School has hosted at least four
Supreme Court Justices (Rehnquist, O'Con
nor, Kennedy, Breyer) in recent memory,
the I lcx)ver institution heard Madeleine Al
bright a few years ago and Bill Bradley was
the keynote speaker for the graduating ('.lass

of2ool 's Class Day. Could Stanford really be
"ill-suited to inquire and engage in events
that address global problems" as the guest
columnists wondered? I lardly.
That said, the tact remains: Bill Clinton
spoke at UC-Berkeley, not Stanford. Why?
We can't answer that < jiiestion fort he en
tire campus, but from our organization's
perspective, at least two issues bear men
tion. Firstly, while the average Stanford stu
dent might assume that the simple privi
lege of being asked to speak at Stanford
would persuade most anyone to come; un
fortunately, that is fin from true. By way of
illustration, this year the Speakers Bureau
has sent 15 offers out for lecture opportu
nities and confirmed only five — that suc
cess rate is fairly average.
Secondly, and more to the point, big
name speakers, like anything else in high
demand, cost an incredible amount. Most
speakers with any name recognition at all
will charge five-figure honoraria, and
some, like President Clinton, bump up that
number — incredibly — to six. Supply and
demand. ()bviously, there is just no way the
Speakers Bureau — or any other organiza
tion on campus for that matter — could af
ford that kind of price tag.
Berkeley, of course, got around the cost
issue. How?
We don't know what the final amount of
money Berkeley paid C -linton was (perhaps
they did use their prestige as a bargaining
device), but Berkeley's school of Journalism
did something the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
as a special fee organization is prohibited
from doing: they sold tickets. Unless some
radical changes are made to the restrictions
governing the use of Special Fee funds —
changes the Speakers Bureau might well
support — many of the biggest name
speakers will simply remain unaffordable.
I hat said, we think we're doing all right.
On Thursday Marc h 7 we will be proud to

showcase Writer / Director Kevin Smith,
and before the year is out you'll be able to
hear Michael Moore, Nadine Strossen
(President of the American Civil Liberties
Union), and Gloria Steinem — each highly
entertaining and engaging "big names" in
their own right.
Iu the meantime, if you'd like to contact
us with speaker suggestions, we're always
willing to listen. Drop us an e-mail
(bfalsey@stanford.edu) or stop any of our
general meetings, Mondays, 9 p.m., at the
ASSU office.

Terrorist groups do not follow same rules as
states
lam writing j n response to Tim Meyer's
Feb. 21 Letter to the Editor in which he crit
icizes Prof.-Emerit.us Robert Cohn's sup
port of President Bush's "axis of evil"
rhetoric in the State of the Union Address.
While I would be the first to side with
Meyer's assertion that Bush's word choice
was certainly over the top and that the com
parison oi the current war against terror
ism to World War II is a bit of a stretch, I
would have to disagree with some of the as
sumptions which seem to underlie his ar
gument and the assert ions he makes.
First, while it may be difficult to prove
Iran's direct involvement in the Sept. 11 at
tacks against New York and Washington,
Iran's link to terrorism in the Middle East,
and elsewhere, is certainly not as nebulous.
Iran has long been a sponsor of terrorist
groups in the Middle East, providing
money, manpower, and materiel to organi
zations that have carried out numerous ter
rorist attacks in Israel, Lebanon, and else
where.
Iran long maintained a terrorist training
camp in southern Lebanon, manned by sol
diers of Iran's elite army corps, that was di
rectly or indirectly (depending on the evi
dence you read) tied to the kidnapping of
American citizens in Lebanon and the
bombings of the U.S. embassy and Marine
barracks in Beirut in 1983. In addition,
known terrorists who received training at
this camp have been directly linked to
Osama bin Laden sAI-Qaeda organization.
If you believe Iranian President Khata
mi's rhetoric in the last few years prior to
Bush's ill-timed declaration, once chilly re
lations between Iran and the U.S. may be
warming slightly, but let's not trick our
selves into thinking that Iran is the Ned
Flanders of the world's Springfield.
Second, Meyer's comparison of the de
velopment of weapons of mass destruction
by nations such as Iran with the nuclear
posture of the Soviet Union during the
Cold War is a bit misguided. Is America
worried that Iran is going to launch an
overwhelming nuclear first strike against
American soil? No probably not. And we
won't be fora long time. I lowever, that, in
no way, lessens our fear of a potential
launch of a nuclear weapon against one of
our allies in the Middle East, or, worse, the
transfer of nuclear technology to a terrorist
organization.

Terrorist groups are not bound by the
same rules of deterrence which govern
state behavior in the nuclear game, and
thus are free of many of the constraints
which may have prevented the use of nu
clear weapons in a situation such as the
Cold War. Iran's link to terrorist groups in
the Middle East and perhaps elsewhere is in
little dispute, and the threat of the prolifer
ation of weapons of mass destruction to a
terrorist group is a viable security concern
lor American policymakers.
Yes, it is hypocritical of Americans to
rally against nuclear proliferation as we
were the first nation to successfully devel
op and the only nation to ever deploy nu
clear weapons, however, such moral
hypocrisy is no way mitigates the tangible
threats posed by nuclear proliferation
such as accidental launch, the transfer of
nuclear technologies or use against a na
tion that does possess the capability to de
liver an overwhelming response.
I agree completely with Meyer's un
written assertion that isolation and vilifi
cation ol states such as Iran, Iraq, and
North Korea is by no means the answer to
the problems that policies of these states
may pose for American security. I lowev
er, at some point, you have to face the facts
and call a duck a duck. While Bush may
have certainly gone a little too far with his
rhetoric, the underlying assumption of
his statement — that nations such as Iran
pose a threat to American security and
may be tied to the terrorist organizations
which carry out attacks such as Sept. 1 1 —
is not so far off.
Should Bush have chosen his words more
carefully? Sure: I mean the guy would have

trouble ordering a happy meal without mis
pronouncing something. But, does that
make what he said, wrong? Not necessarily.

Muslim and Pakistani associations
condemn Pearl killing
We strongly condemn the cold-blooded
killing of the American journalist Daniel
Pearl by terrorists. Their horrific action
makes a mockery of our notions of human
rights, freedom and justice.
This disturbing execution has happened
during one of our most sacred holidays
when we mark the anniversary of the last
sermon of Mohammed. 1 le admonished
Muslims, "Treat others justly so that no one
would be unjust to you. Remember that
you will indeed meet your Lord, and that
I le will indeed reckon your deeds."
We, The Stanford Muslim Students
Awareness Network and Pakistanis At Stan
ford, are shocked and upset by this brutali
ty. Our united appeals and efforts with
other members of the Stanford community
for the release of Daniel Pearl (class of 1985)
sadly proved futile. We now join other Mus
lims and Pakistanis all around the world in
condemning Mr. Pearl's murder.
Our prayers are with Mr. Pearl's wile
and unborn son, family and friends during
this difficult time.

Daily coverage of Stanford
Democrats 'insufficient^
The weekend of Feb. 16 to 18 over 15
Stanford Democrats attended the Califor
nia Democratic Party Convention in Los
Angeles as a part of the Steve Westly for
State Controller campaign. While the expe
riences of a few students were highlighted
in "Students Attend Democratic Conven
tion" (Feb. 21), we feel that The Daily's cov
erage was insufficient in highlight ing the ef
forts made by the Stanford Democrats, The
Stanford I .aw Democrats and the Westly
For Controller campaign to give students
the opportunity to attend the convention.
As members of the Stanford Democrats
Hoard and staff members of the Westly
campaign, we wish to highlight the efforts
made by the students, the campaign and
their partnership.
By no means were any of the students
in attendance given the opportunity to at
tend the convention solely as a result of
their individual actions or attendance at
local democratic clubs. From freshmen to
law students, the volunteers who attend
ed the convention this weekend were a
part of a "mini-campaign" within the
greater statewide campaign. Preparation
for the convention began weeks before
departing for Los Angeles, with hours
spent doing anything from calling dele
gates who voted this weekend to making
hand-painted posters for the convention
floor, to devising a campaign plan for vis
ibility and getting out the vote. These ef
forts were just as important to the success
of winning the majority vote as attending
the convention.

Not only was the volunteer effort benefi
cial to the campaign, but even more so to
the students who have learned a great deal
about electoral politics and a clearer under
standing of California statewide politics.
Nearly all of the students who attended
were proxies for delegates who could not
attend, affording them the opportunity to
hear some of the country's foremost politi
cians speak on topics of national interest
and allowing them to vote for party en
dorsements of statewide candidates.
The partnership between the Stanford
Democrats, Stanford I .aw Democrats and
the Wesdy For Controller campaign is a re
sult of Steve Wesdy's commitment to young
people and the power of their role in the
political process.
As a Stanford alumnus and former
teacher at the Graduate School of Business,
Steve Westly's commitment to the Stanford
community has ranged from being co-pres
ident of the ASSU and leading a shutdown
of the University because of investments in
South Africa during apartheid, to being a
faculty advisor to freshmen.
l he Stanford students who committed
their time and effort to the campaign be
lieve Wesdy's combination ofbusiness, gov
ernment and educational experience make
him the best-qualified candidate to be Cali
fornia's next State Controller. We encour
age all Stanford community members, to
vote in statewide primary elections on
March 5.
