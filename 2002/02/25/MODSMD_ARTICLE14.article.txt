Stanford does attract prominent speakers
Two weeks ago The Daily printed a Let
ter to the Editor entitled "Stanford Should
Attract Famous Speakers/' The piece was
motivated by the two authors' recent visit to
UC-Berkeley and the lecture recently de
livered there by former President Bill Clin
ton. I'he authors' shared experience left
them asking, "why does Stanford often fail
to attract big name speakers?"
It's a good question. We in the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, as the organization pri
marily responsible for bringing lecturers
here to campus — and obviously sharing in
the authors' desire for visits from promi
nent leaders — thought some words of ex
planation might be in order.
First, Stanford (Clinton notwithstand
ing) has hosted a number of big name
speakers over the past years. Maya Angelou
and F.W. de Klerk were both standouts
from last year's Speakers Bureau lineup
(the first filling Memorial Church and the
second sparking a huge campus dialogue),
and this year's address from former Pak
istani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's gen
erated enough interest to (ill Memorial Au
ditorium — making it the largest Speakers
Bureau event of the past few years. Bhutto
even caught the attention of folks outside of
"the Stanford bubble," drawing all the
major Bay Area news organizations to her
pre-lecture press conference.
Additionally, many other departments
and organizations on campus have been able
to present their share of "big names,"
though their events may have been less pub
licized or restricted to the general public.
The Law School has hosted at least four
Supreme Court Justices (Rehnquist, O'Con
nor, Kennedy, Breyer) in recent memory,
the I lcx)ver institution heard Madeleine Al
bright a few years ago and Bill Bradley was
the keynote speaker for the graduating ('.lass

of2ool 's Class Day. Could Stanford really be
"ill-suited to inquire and engage in events
that address global problems" as the guest
columnists wondered? I lardly.
That said, the tact remains: Bill Clinton
spoke at UC-Berkeley, not Stanford. Why?
We can't answer that < jiiestion fort he en
tire campus, but from our organization's
perspective, at least two issues bear men
tion. Firstly, while the average Stanford stu
dent might assume that the simple privi
lege of being asked to speak at Stanford
would persuade most anyone to come; un
fortunately, that is fin from true. By way of
illustration, this year the Speakers Bureau
has sent 15 offers out for lecture opportu
nities and confirmed only five — that suc
cess rate is fairly average.
Secondly, and more to the point, big
name speakers, like anything else in high
demand, cost an incredible amount. Most
speakers with any name recognition at all
will charge five-figure honoraria, and
some, like President Clinton, bump up that
number — incredibly — to six. Supply and
demand. ()bviously, there is just no way the
Speakers Bureau — or any other organiza
tion on campus for that matter — could af
ford that kind of price tag.
Berkeley, of course, got around the cost
issue. How?
We don't know what the final amount of
money Berkeley paid C -linton was (perhaps
they did use their prestige as a bargaining
device), but Berkeley's school of Journalism
did something the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
as a special fee organization is prohibited
from doing: they sold tickets. Unless some
radical changes are made to the restrictions
governing the use of Special Fee funds —
changes the Speakers Bureau might well
support — many of the biggest name
speakers will simply remain unaffordable.
I hat said, we think we're doing all right.
On Thursday Marc h 7 we will be proud to

showcase Writer / Director Kevin Smith,
and before the year is out you'll be able to
hear Michael Moore, Nadine Strossen
(President of the American Civil Liberties
Union), and Gloria Steinem — each highly
entertaining and engaging "big names" in
their own right.
Iu the meantime, if you'd like to contact
us with speaker suggestions, we're always
willing to listen. Drop us an e-mail
(bfalsey@stanford.edu) or stop any of our
general meetings, Mondays, 9 p.m., at the
ASSU office.

lam writing j n response to Tim Meyer's
Feb. 21 Letter to the Editor in which he crit
icizes Prof.-Emerit.us Robert Cohn's sup
port of President Bush's "axis of evil"
rhetoric in the State of the Union Address.
While I would be the first to side with
Meyer's assertion that Bush's word choice
was certainly over the top and that the com
parison oi the current war against terror
ism to World War II is a bit of a stretch, I
would have to disagree with some of the as
sumptions which seem to underlie his ar
gument and the assert ions he makes.
First, while it may be difficult to prove
Iran's direct involvement in the Sept. 11 at
tacks against New York and Washington,
Iran's link to terrorism in the Middle East,
and elsewhere, is certainly not as nebulous.
Iran has long been a sponsor of terrorist
groups in the Middle East, providing
money, manpower, and materiel to organi
zations that have carried out numerous ter
