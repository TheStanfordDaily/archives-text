## A 						Maples farewell? Maybe... 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
It was Senior Day at Maples
on Saturday afternoon.
As seniors Tony Giovacchini
and Kyle Logan greeted their
parents at half court with roses
and hugs for what would be
their last regular-season game
at Maples, you couldn't help
wondering which what other
Cardinal players might have
been stepping out onto the
hardwood floor for the last
time.

Amid all of the hoopla sur
rounding this much-anticipated
meeting between UCLA and Stan
ford, there remained an over
hanging tension in the air, though
nobody wanted to talk about it..
But as junior wingman Casey
Jacobsen picked up his fifth foul
with less than a minute to play in
the Cardinal's 95-92 loss to
UCLA, he walked off the court to
Sixth Man Club chants of "one
more year, one more year."
Ironically, on Senior Day, it
was the freshmen who stole
the spotlight.

Stanford freshman point
guard Chris Hernandez stepped
in and provided a real spark for
the Cardinal, putting up his best
offensive performance to date.
He finished with 14 points, four
assists and two steals in only 18
minutes of play.
"A couple shots went down
for me and I was fortunate, but
there was lots of stuff that I didn't
do well," said a disappointed and
humble Hernandez. "There
were two times in the zone that I
fell and Kapono hit those threes. I
let Bozeman take me a couple
times to the rack, so offensively 1
got lucky but defensively that was
why we lost this game."
Despite his scrappy play, I ler
nandez was visibly in pain, grimac
ing often as he repeatedly dived for
loose balls and tried to make steals.
He wore a heavy wrap around his
left shoulder to protect what he
humbly calls, "a slight separation."
The pain "comes and goes,"
Hernandez said. "I'll get hit and
[the pain] will be with me fora
while. But [the injury] is recover
ing, I think."
Hernandez wasn't the only
freshman to make an impact Sat
urday. The Bruins happily intro
duced a whole slew of underclass
men to a national CBS audience.
Freshmen Cedric Bozeman,
Dijon Thompson, Andre Fatter
son and Ryan Walcott all con
tributed to the Bruin victory. Com
bined, the four frosh were respon
sible for over a third of UCLA's
total offense.
"I'm proud of the kids' effort,"
said UCLA head coach Steve
Lavin. "We're still a work in
progress, but today is a step in the
light direction. 1 thought all the
underclassmen played well."
Everyone was afforded a short
glimpse of the future on Saturday,
while questions surrounding Stan
ford's current stars are unavoid
able and unforgettable.
The idea of junior center Bor
chardt and Jacobsen returning for
their senior years is quite romantic.
In spite of the hardships this Car
dinal squad has already faced this
year. In spite of the amazing obsta
cles that lie ahead. In spite of all the

scrutiny Stanford has been under,
the undue criticism that it has en
dured for being only a top-20
school.
In spite of all that, imagine
what "one more year" would do
for this team.
A healthy Borchardt, a greatly
improved Barnes, a still magnifi
cent Jacobsen, a rapidly emerg
ing underclass with future stars
like freshman wingman Chil
dress, Hernandez and freshman
center Rob Littleâ€” no doubt a
preseason top-10 team.
Maybe Jake and Borch should
have been thanked as well.
Maybe their parents should
have been introduced to the crowd.
Maybe they should have run
through that little tunnel to a stand
ing ovation in front of a sellout crowd.
Maybe we all just witnessed the
last hurrah.
But in the end, as Stanford
headed to the locker room three
points short of victory, there wasn't
really all that much to cheer about.
