WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Sunday: No. 2 Stanford 98,
UCLA 80

For the fourth time in school
history, the women's basketball
team emerged from regular-sea
son conference play undefeated,
this time after wins against both
Southern California and UCLA.
The Pacific 10 Conference
champions (28-1, 18-0 Pac-10)
faced some tough competition
down south, especially from
USC (15-12, 11-7).
The Women of Troy, in a des
perate race for an NCAA bid, ex
ploded into the game on Friday,
challenging the Cardinal with
an aggressive full-court press
that saw results.
After trading leads in the first
half, USC went on a 16-4 run to
close out the half, scoring in tran
sition and off of Stanford's un
characteristic 15 turnovers. The
run gave the Women ofTroy a 36-
28 lead at the half and presented
the Cardinal with its biggest chal
lenge in conference play.
"I wasn't excited about how
we came out," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "I really chal
lenged them to be better on de
fense. [USC] is aggressive and
very athletic and you have to be
able to run your offense."
Stanford took those words to
heart, immediately sparking a
14-0 run of its own to retake the
lead and put away the Women
ofTroy.
Heading the Cardinal come
back was sophomore forward
Nicole Powell. Powell scored a
career-high 36 points in the vic
tory, the fifth-best performance
ever by a Stanford player.
The Naismith and Pac-10
Player of the Year candidate
went inside, driving the lane and
pulling up for short jumpers or
stopping at the top of the key to
toss in one of her four three
pointers on the night.
"1 think Nicole's a fabulous

player," VanDerveer said. "She
showed how competitive she is
and she's an excellent floor
leader too."
Senior guard Lindsey Ya
masaki added 20 points of her
own as Stanford went on to de
feat use, 78-60.
The Cardinal then headed
up the 405 Freeway on Sunday
to face the Bruins (8-19, 4-14)
in its final regular match-up of
the season.
Stanford lit up Pauley Pavil
ion with its perimeter game,
tying a school record by making
1 (i three-pointers. Seven of them
were made by Yamasaki, who led

all scorers with 33 points, one shy
of tying her personal collegiate
best in the Cardinal's 98-80 victo
ry. The Cardinal opened the
game by nailing its first three at
tempts from behind the 3-point
line and had a commanding 24-
10 lead with just under 14 min
utes to go in the first half.
Powell added three 3-pointers
of her own while freshman
guard Kelley Suminski made

The Stanford running game
was also in line form as the team

scoring inside and outside. Ya

side the paint, scoring in transi
tion on a highlight reel reverse
layup off an assist from Suminski.
"Lindsey shot the ball really
well, and offensively we did
some really nice things," Van-
Derveer said.
Though the Bruins never real
ly challenged the Cardinal's lead,
UCLA proved to be more trouble
than expected.
The Bruins played strong
throughout the game, matching
the Cardinal's second half total of

48 to keep it close.
UCLA reserve guard Gen
nifer Arranga scored a career
high 21 points.
"We didn't play very well," Ya
masaki said. "This wasn't the No. 2
team in the country playing
tonight. We're excited, but there's
still a long way to go, and we need
to do so much. I hate to say it, but
1 think we got complacent."
"I was a bit surprised, Van-
Derveer said. "We gave up 80
points to a team that usually
doesn't score that many. More
than anything, we need a better
defensive effort."
Defense will be the largest
component of the team's game
plan this week as it prepares for
the inaugural Pac-10 Tourna
ment where the team could face
both UCLA and USC again in just
a few days.
"We see everyone's best
game," VanDerveer said. "Who
ever we play, we've got to meet
that challenge."
