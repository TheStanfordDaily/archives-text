# Garko lifts Cardinal to series win
## Junior catcher's two-run walk-off homer clinches series victory 
### MAC LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When you're the No. 1 team in the na
tion, it's pretty safe to say that you have a
giant bull's eye on the backs of your jer
seys, so you'd better be ready for every
team gunning at you.
This weekend, if the top-ranked Car
dinal (9-4) didn't know that already, it
definitely found this out, as the team
fought scrappy local rival Santa Clara (5-

8) to the brink all weekend, eventually
winning two of three games. Both of
Stanford's victories came on the Cardi
nal's last at-bat.
On a beautifully sunny Sunday after
noon at Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal
capped off an intense weekend of base
ball with a thrilling 8-7 win, as junior

catcher Ryan Garko delivered the ulti
mate knockout punch in the form of a
two-run walk-off homer.
After the Broncos scrambled back
from a 6-2 deficit in the top of the eighth
inning with five runs, neither team
scored in its next opportunity at the
plate. Therefore, it all came down to the
bottom of the ninth.
Sophomore center fielder Sam Fuld
lined the inning's first pitch into left field
fora single off Santa Clara reliever A.J.
Ampi, setting up probably the most ex
citing moment of the short season. With
a 1-1 count, Ampi delivered a fastball
over the outer part of the plate, and the
6-foot-2, 235-pound Garko crushed it
over the fence in left-center field for the
game-winner.
"I was just trying to get the ball in the
air and do something special," said
Garko, who went 2 for 4 on the day with
three RBI. " The guy made a pretty good
pitch, but I just got a hold of it."
Freshman Johnny Dyer (1-0) got the
win, his first in college, by pitching 2/3 of
an inning. Dyer got the Cardinal out of a
big jam in the top of the ninth to keep the
game within reach.
The big story on the mound, though,
had to be starter Tim Cunningham,
who threw seven solid innings, giving
up four earned runs and striking out
six, before tiring a little in the Broncos'
big eighth inning.
"Cunningham pitched a great game,
one of the better games pitched all year
for us," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "He deserved a win. Unfortu-
