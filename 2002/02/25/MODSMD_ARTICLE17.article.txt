# Garko lifts Cardinal to series win
## Junior catcher's two-run walk-off homer clinches series victory 
### MAC LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When you're the No. 1 team in the na
tion, it's pretty safe to say that you have a
giant bull's eye on the backs of your jer
seys, so you'd better be ready for every
team gunning at you.
This weekend, if the top-ranked Car
dinal (9-4) didn't know that already, it
definitely found this out, as the team
fought scrappy local rival Santa Clara (5-

8) to the brink all weekend, eventually
winning two of three games. Both of
Stanford's victories came on the Cardi
nal's last at-bat.
On a beautifully sunny Sunday after
noon at Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal
capped off an intense weekend of base
ball with a thrilling 8-7 win, as junior

catcher Ryan Garko delivered the ulti
mate knockout punch in the form of a
two-run walk-off homer.
After the Broncos scrambled back
from a 6-2 deficit in the top of the eighth
inning with five runs, neither team
scored in its next opportunity at the
plate. Therefore, it all came down to the
bottom of the ninth.
Sophomore center fielder Sam Fuld
lined the inning's first pitch into left field
fora single off Santa Clara reliever A.J.
Ampi, setting up probably the most ex
citing moment of the short season. With
a 1-1 count, Ampi delivered a fastball
over the outer part of the plate, and the
6-foot-2, 235-pound Garko crushed it
over the fence in left-center field for the
game-winner.
"I was just trying to get the ball in the
air and do something special," said
Garko, who went 2 for 4 on the day with
three RBI. " The guy made a pretty good
pitch, but I just got a hold of it."
Freshman Johnny Dyer (1-0) got the
win, his first in college, by pitching 2/3 of
an inning. Dyer got the Cardinal out of a
big jam in the top of the ninth to keep the
game within reach.
The big story on the mound, though,
had to be starter Tim Cunningham,
who threw seven solid innings, giving
up four earned runs and striking out
six, before tiring a little in the Broncos'
big eighth inning.
"Cunningham pitched a great game,
one of the better games pitched all year
for us," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "He deserved a win. Unfortu-

Junior catcher Ryan Garko, a.k.a. "Budding," short for "Budding Superstar," hit a two-run

Santa Clara on Sunday. The top-ranked Cardinal took two of three from the Broncos this
weekend.

pitching was phenomenal."
Sunday's thriller was not the
only time that the Cardinal deliv
ered late-game heroics, as Friday's
series opener came down to the
team's last at-bat as well.
At the start, the game looked
like an old-fashioned pitcher's
duel, as Stanford ace Jeremy
Cuthrie and the Broncos' Chad
Fillinger matched wits for five
scoreless innings. But each team
got on tl»e board in the sixth, and
the game went into the bottom of
the eighth inning with the Cardi
nal trailing, 4-3.
Junior second baseman Chris
O'Riordan brought home sopho
more left fielder Brian Hall with
a sacrifice fly in the eighth to

even the score. After sophomore
John Hudgins and senior J.I).
Willcox shut down the Broncos
in their half of the ninth, it once
again came down to Stanford's
"last lick."
With one out and sophomore
right fielder Carlos Quentin on
second base, junior designated
hitter Jason Cooper came to the
plate, and he delivered the game
winner with a clutch RBI single.
I lowever, the euphoria did not
last long, as the Broncos respond
ed with a wild 13-9 victory of their
own on Saturday at Buck Shaw
Stadium, snapping the team's 20-
game losing streak to Stanford.
I he Cardinal lost despite get
ting on the board with six runs in
the top of the first inning. Broncos
starter John Redmond (3-1) even
tually settled down and did what
Stanford pitchers failed to accom
plish all day — get batters out.
Third baseman Andy Topham

went 3 for 3 in the losing effort,
and Cardinal junior hurler Drew
Erlich (0-1) got his first collegiate
loss in relief of junior Ryan Mc-
Cally, who was making his first
start ever for the Cardinal.
Through the three games, the
series was teeming with intensity
and even a little competitive beef
between the two teams separated
by only 14 miles.
The Broncos definitely came
into the series hyped to battle the
No. 1 team in the country — as
was evident by their raucous
bench from the start.
"We were pretty tired of their
antics all weekend, and I thought
we couldn't let them come in and
beat us two of three times," said
Garko, who had a monster series,
going (i of 11 with six RBI. "Es
pecially with the whole Bay Area
rivalry, it was kind of letting

Through the three games, the
series was teeming with intensity
and even a little competitive beef
between the two teams separated
by only 14 miles.
The Broncos definitely came
into the series hyped to battle the
No. 1 team in the country — as
was evident by their raucous
bench from the start.
"We were pretty tired of their
antics all weekend, and I thought
we couldn't let them come in and
beat us two of three times," said
Garko, who had a monster series,
going (i of 11 with six RBI. "Es
pecially with the whole Bay Area
rivalry, it was kind of letting
them know that we're still the
better team."
When you're the No. 1 team in the na
tion, it's pretty safe to say that you have a
giant bull's eye on the backs of your jer
seys, so you'd better be ready for every
team gunning at you.
This weekend, if the top-ranked Car
dinal (9-4) didn't know that already, it
definitely found this out, as the team
fought scrappy local rival Santa Clara (5-

winning two of three games. Both of
Stanford's victories came on the Cardi
nal's last at-bat.
On a beautifully sunny Sunday after
noon at Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal
capped off an intense weekend of base
ball with a thrilling 8-7 win, as junior

catcher Ryan Garko delivered the ulti
mate knockout punch in the form of a
two-run walk-off homer.
After the Broncos scrambled back
from a 6-2 deficit in the top of the eighth
inning with five runs, neither team
scored in its next opportunity at the
plate. Therefore, it all came down to the
bottom of the ninth.
Sophomore center fielder Sam Fuld
lined the inning's first pitch into left field
fora single off Santa Clara reliever A.J.
Ampi, setting up probably the most ex
citing moment of the short season. With
a 1-1 count, Ampi delivered a fastball
over the outer part of the plate, and the
6-foot-2, 235-pound Garko crushed it
over the fence in left-center field for the
game-winner.
"I was just trying to get the ball in the
air and do something special," said
Garko, who went 2 for 4 on the day with
three RBI. " The guy made a pretty good
pitch, but I just got a hold of it."
Freshman Johnny Dyer (1-0) got the
win, his first in college, by pitching 2/3 of
an inning. Dyer got the Cardinal out of a
big jam in the top of the ninth to keep the
game within reach.
The big story on the mound, though,
had to be starter Tim Cunningham,
who threw seven solid innings, giving
up four earned runs and striking out
six, before tiring a little in the Broncos'
big eighth inning.
"Cunningham pitched a great game,
one of the better games pitched all year
for us," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "He deserved a win. Unfortu-

series opener came down to the
