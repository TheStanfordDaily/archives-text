# Men's swimming has no trouble with Cal
## 
### KENNETH GARRETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the No. 4 California men's swim team
ever had any illusions alxwt upsetting the
top-ranked Cardinal (H-0, 1-0 Pacific 10
Conference), it was badly mistaken.
On a day when an unprecedented eight
pool records fell at the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter, the Cardinal sent the Bears (6-2, 3-1)
back across the Bay with their tails between
their legs.
"It was everything I didn't expect and
then some more," said sophomore
Markus Rogan.

4 California 104.5

in the 200-yard medley relay, sophomore
Peter Marshall astonished the crowd with a
personal best 45.61 in the 100 backstroke.
"He had time to see the results and call
his grandma by the time I touched," Rogan
said with his characteristic wit.
Marshall's time was the third fastest
100-backstroke in the history of swimming

Sophomore Peter Marshall reacts to setting a pool record in the 100-yard backstroke in the top
ranked Cardinal's meet against California on Saturday. Stanford defeated No. 4 Cal, 195.5-
104.5.
and is also the fastest time in the
nation this year.
"It really didn't seem possible
until I looked tip after my race and
saw my time," Marshall said. "1
thought the clock was wrong — I
didn't know what to think."
Rogan need not be so modest,
as he also set pool records in the
200 IM and 200 backstroke. His
nation-leading time in the 200
back (1:41.58) would have placed
him second at NCAAs last year,
and Rogan is not even rested or
shaved for top performance.
Not allowing the crowd a
chance to rest its feet or its vocal
chords, sophomore Michael Bruce
set two pool records of his own.
While his 100 breaststroke was
stunning, his 200 breaststroke was

the best time in the nation this
year, at 1:55.85.
"When 1 looked up at the clock, 1
was elated," said Bruce. "1 felt great
during the race, and it feels really
good to be back on top of my game."
Perhaps the biggest surprise of
the day was backstroke phenome
non Randall Bal's utter dominance
in the sprint freestyle events. In a
short but very intense race, Bal, a
junior, tied the Bears' Olympic
gold medalist Anthony Ervin in
the 50 free (19.46).
Stanford's pool record had
stood for over a decade before this
year, yet it was the second time Bal
broke it in less than a month.
The meet finished with another
matchup between Bal and Ervin on
the last leg of the 400 free relay. The
pair was neck-and-neck until Bal
simply willed himself to win, clinch
ing a final victory for the Cardinal
team of Marshall, Bobby O'Bryan,
Andrew Schnell and Bal (2:54.93).

"That relay is what racing is all
about," Bruce said.
Aside from the fact that the meet
was the fastest dual meet in collegiate
history, it was unusual for another
reason. Many Cardinal parents were
in attendance, enjoying the sunshine
almost as much as their sons.
"The cheering motivated the
Cardinal to swim its best," Marshall
said. "With all that noise, you feel like
a basketball player, only in Speedos."
The Cardinal now looks to the
Pac-10 Championships in two
weeks and NCAAs two weeks
later, knowing that every swim
mer in the country has their sights
set on Stanford.
"We're walking in there with
targets on our backs," Rogan said.
But the Cardinal is up to the
challenge.
"Everyone will start setting high
er goals because everyone swam
amazingly yesterday. The sky is the
limit," Bal said.

the last leg of the 400 free relay. The
pair was neck-and-neck until Bal
simply willed himself to win, clinch
ing a final victory for the Cardinal
team of Marshall, Bobby O'Bryan,
Andrew Schnell and Bal (2:54.93).

"That relay is what racing is all
about," Bruce said.
Aside from the fact that the meet
was the fastest dual meet in collegiate
history, it was unusual for another
reason. Many Cardinal parents were
in attendance, enjoying the sunshine
almost as much as their sons.
"The cheering motivated the
Cardinal to swim its best," Marshall
said. "With all that noise, you feel like
a basketball player, only in Speedos."
The Cardinal now looks to the
Pac-10 Championships in two
weeks and NCAAs two weeks
later, knowing that every swim
mer in the country has their sights
set on Stanford.
"We're walking in there with
targets on our backs," Rogan said.
But the Cardinal is up to the
challenge.
"Everyone will start setting high
er goals because everyone swam
amazingly yesterday. The sky is the
limit," Bal said.
