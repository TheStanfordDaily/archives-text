If the No. 4 California men's swim team
ever had any illusions alxwt upsetting the
top-ranked Cardinal (H-0, 1-0 Pacific 10
Conference), it was badly mistaken.
On a day when an unprecedented eight
pool records fell at the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter, the Cardinal sent the Bears (6-2, 3-1)
back across the Bay with their tails between
their legs.
"It was everything I didn't expect and
then some more," said sophomore
Markus Rogan.

in the 200-yard medley relay, sophomore
Peter Marshall astonished the crowd with a
personal best 45.61 in the 100 backstroke.
"He had time to see the results and call
his grandma by the time I touched," Rogan
said with his characteristic wit.
Marshall's time was the third fastest
100-backstroke in the history of swimming
