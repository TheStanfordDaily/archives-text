## 
### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday, the men's tennis
team found out the hard way that
all good things must eventually
come to an end.

MEN S TENNIS
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford
loses to No. 17 California, 4-3

Coming into the match, No. 1
Stanford (7-1) proudly carried a
21-game winning streak against
No. 17 California (6-3) stretching
back to 1991, as well as a 75-
game home streak dating to the
1996 season.
Unfortunately, both streaks
were cut short by the Golden
Bears' shocking 4-3 win over the
Cardinal at the Taube Tennis Cen
ter. The Bears, down three points
to none, came roaring back with
wins in the final four singles
matches, including three hard
fought three-set contests.
The day started with an upset of
the No. 9 doubles team of junior
Ryan Haviland and senior K.J.
Hippensteel by Cal's duo of John
Paul Fruttero and Robert Kowal
c/yk, 8-6. However, Stanford's
other two doubles teams posted
easy victories, and the Cardinal
captured the doubles point.
In singles, No. 45 Scott Lipsky
and No. 37 Haviland quickly
added to Stanford's lead. Lipsky,
playing at No. 2 singles, easily dis
patched No. 71 Balazs Veress, 6-2,
6-4, and Haviland, playing at No. 4
singles, blasted past his opponent,
Conor Niland, 6-1, 6-4. With their
wins, the Cardinal was up 3-0.
However, the four remaining
singles matches were real battles.
Freshman Phil Sheng lost a heart

breaking first set marathon, 7-5,
then self-destructed, losing the sec
ond set, 6-0.
In the most surprising upset of
the day, No. 125 Fruttero came
roaring out of the gate and quickly
gained a break against top-ranked
Hippensteel on a disputed call,
and capitalized on his early for
tune to take the first set, 6-3. I lip
pensteel fought back in the second
set, crushing Fruttero, 6-1, but was
outplayed in the final set, 3-6.
"[Fruttero] came out very
strong in the first set, gained con
fidence, and ran with it," Hip
pensteel said. "Unfortunately, in
the third set, he was able to come
up with the big shots."
Another crucial decision was
lost by No. 16 David Martin,
who fell to Wayne Wong, 6-7 (5-
7), 6-3, 3-6.
With the score tied at three, the
entire match rested on the final
duel on Court Six. In an incredi
ble battle of wills, Stanford 112 resh
man Sam Warburg traded sets
with Caljunior Robert Kowalczyk,
and was down in the third set, 6-4,
3-6, 3-5. Warburg managed to
break Kowalczyk's serve and take
the match to a tiebreak. Down 0-6
in the tiebreak, Warburg pulled
out four amazing points before
missing a volley on a ball that
clipped the net.
"It's disappointing to lose a
match like this," Warburg said.
"But we have to get back up and go
at it again. We'll just prepare like
we've prepared before. This match
was a good learning experience."
Stanford's next two matches are
against Utah today and Santa
Clara on Tuesday. The Cardinal
has a combined 23-1 record
against the two schools. Both
matches will start at 1:30 p.m. at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.

"It makes you appreciate how
good winning feels," Hippensteel
said. "We're now anxious to get
out there and play."
Although Saturday's match
marked the first Pacific 10 Con
ference opponent the Cardinal

has faced this year, the results
will not count toward the stand
ings. The first official Pac-10
match is scheduled for March 29
against Oregon.
Stanford's next match against
Cal will be on April 9 in Berkeley.

MEN S TENNIS
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford
loses to No. 17 California, 4-3

Coming into the match, No. 1
Stanford (7-1) proudly carried a
21-game winning streak against
No. 17 California (6-3) stretching
back to 1991, as well as a 75-
game home streak dating to the
1996 season.
Unfortunately, both streaks
were cut short by the Golden
Bears' shocking 4-3 win over the
Cardinal at the Taube Tennis Cen
ter. The Bears, down three points
to none, came roaring back with
wins in the final four singles
matches, including three hard
fought three-set contests.
The day started with an upset of
the No. 9 doubles team of junior
Ryan Haviland and senior K.J.
Hippensteel by Cal's duo of John
Paul Fruttero and Robert Kowal
c/yk, 8-6. However, Stanford's
other two doubles teams posted
easy victories, and the Cardinal
captured the doubles point.
In singles, No. 45 Scott Lipsky
and No. 37 Haviland quickly
added to Stanford's lead. Lipsky,
playing at No. 2 singles, easily dis
patched No. 71 Balazs Veress, 6-2,
6-4, and Haviland, playing at No. 4
singles, blasted past his opponent,
Conor Niland, 6-1, 6-4. With their
wins, the Cardinal was up 3-0.
However, the four remaining
singles matches were real battles.
Freshman Phil Sheng lost a heart

breaking first set marathon, 7-5,
then self-destructed, losing the sec
ond set, 6-0.
In the most surprising upset of
the day, No. 125 Fruttero came
roaring out of the gate and quickly
gained a break against top-ranked
Hippensteel on a disputed call,
and capitalized on his early for
tune to take the first set, 6-3. I lip
pensteel fought back in the second
set, crushing Fruttero, 6-1, but was
outplayed in the final set, 3-6.
"[Fruttero] came out very
strong in the first set, gained con
fidence, and ran with it," Hip
pensteel said. "Unfortunately, in
the third set, he was able to come
up with the big shots."
Another crucial decision was
lost by No. 16 David Martin,
who fell to Wayne Wong, 6-7 (5-
7), 6-3, 3-6.
With the score tied at three, the
entire match rested on the final
duel on Court Six. In an incredi
ble battle of wills, Stanford 112 resh
man Sam Warburg traded sets
with Caljunior Robert Kowalczyk,
and was down in the third set, 6-4,
3-6, 3-5. Warburg managed to
break Kowalczyk's serve and take
the match to a tiebreak. Down 0-6
in the tiebreak, Warburg pulled
out four amazing points before
missing a volley on a ball that
clipped the net.
"It's disappointing to lose a
match like this," Warburg said.
"But we have to get back up and go
at it again. We'll just prepare like
we've prepared before. This match
was a good learning experience."
Stanford's next two matches are
against Utah today and Santa
Clara on Tuesday. The Cardinal
has a combined 23-1 record
against the two schools. Both
matches will start at 1:30 p.m. at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
