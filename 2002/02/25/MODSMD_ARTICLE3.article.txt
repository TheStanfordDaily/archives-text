# Facing money woes, Bon Appetit fires Co Ho chief
## 
### JEN GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
The management of Bon Appetit — the
company that runs the Coffee House —
laid off manager Dan Maxwell several weeks
ago due to a lac k of financial resources.
Some people associated with the Coffee
House see this move as symptomatic of larg
er problems confronting the campus cafe.
Critics have cited a lack of creative direction
and a sanitized environment. Some people
would like to see the Coffee House changed
to feel more like it did before its renovation
several years ago.
Bon Appetit, however, says that it is tak
ing steps to adapt the Coffee House to re
flect students' desires despite recent cut
backs and that eliminating the position of
Coffee House manager will only serve cus

tomers better.
"[Revenue] has dropped in the last three
years by easily a quarter," said Marvin Ro
driguez, head of Bon Appetit at Stanford,
citing competition from other campus
venues such as smaller cafes and the Tree

House.
Rodriguez stressed the deci
sion to lay off Maxwell was moti
vated completely by finances.
"He was performing well, but if
Maxwell stayed we had to cut
down somewhere and that meant
longer lines," Rodriguez said.
Bon Appetit also recently elim
inated a managerial position in its
catering department at Stanford.
Under the new arrangement,
several shift managers have as
sumed Maxwell's former duties.
"I'm handling the personnel is
sues that [Maxwell] used to take
care of, assigning breaks and tasks,
and holding the crew together,"
said junior Jonny Akchin, who
now works as a shift manager.
Besides the immediate difficul
ties that come from adapting to
the change, shift managers and
workers said that general day-to
day operation has not changed
very much.
"Without a manager it doesn't
really make a difference at all,"

said Talor Round, a Coffee House
employee. "It's all a team thing."
While the managerial shift has
not yet had a tangible effect on the
Coffee House, the cafe faces the
more long-standing issue of stu
dents being dissatisfied with its am
bience, especially after major reno
vations completed just over two
years ago.
"It's brought in a different
crowd," said Flo Nocar, a shift
manager who graduated from
Stanford last year. "I think people
used to look at it as a homier kind
of place."
Rodriguez also acknowl
edged that many students
now negatively describe the
Coffee House as "sterile."
"I talked to a couple of people
for parent's weekend who said,
'This is like walking into McDon
ald's'," Rodriguez said.
With Maxwell's position gone,
some have raised concerns that
the Coffee House will not be able
to improve.
"I don't think the Co Ho has
the priority in the central of fice to
bring it back to life," Akchin said.
"[Upper management] certainly
can't expect me or any student to

be a creative driver."
Maxwell said that he was not
able to institute modifications be
cause of the economic situation
during his term as manager.
"The nit is so deep that I wasn't
able to implement my plans, and now
I'm not there," he said.
He also saw students as notably
uninvolved in making the
changes they wanted at the Coffee
House, especially in light of sur
veys being taken at other venues,
such as the Tree House.
"The Co Ho is making changes
not driven by the students,"
Maxwell said. "If students want to
make the changes, students
would need to come forward."
Leeroy Fitch, the director of
retail at Tresidder Union, will
now be overseeing the Coffee
House.
"[Fitch is] just going to be
doing what he's been doing, but
now he's just going to be focused
towards the Coffee House," Ro
driguez said, emphasizing that it
is misleading to think that the
Coffee House is now without a
manager.
For the Coffee House's first
seven years of operation, it did

not have its own manager, a
practice that Rodriguez de
scribed as "industry standard."
The position was only created
three years ago when competi
tion increased.
Rodriguez also said that broad
er decisions about the Coffee
I louse have always been handled
by him and Bon Appetit's district
manager.
"In fact what we have done is
going to improve what we are
doing," he said. "We were over
working the manager at the Cof
fee House," whom Rodriguez
described as so busy with taking
care of shifts that he was not able
to contribute to giving direction.
Furthermore, Rodriguez stat
ed that management is aware of
student concern about the Coffee
House's feel and is currently
working to change it. He cited col
laboration with the ASSU Senate
as well as dialogue with students
regarding the cafe's mural.
"The final design [after the
renovations] is not maybe what it
should have been," lie said.
"We're trying to give it some of
that atmosphere back, so it looks
not so sterile."

now works as a shift manager.
Besides the immediate difficul
ties that come from adapting to
the change, shift managers and
workers said that general day-to
day operation has not changed
very much.
"Without a manager it doesn't
really make a difference at all,"

said Talor Round, a Coffee House
employee. "It's all a team thing."
While the managerial shift has
not yet had a tangible effect on the
Coffee House, the cafe faces the
more long-standing issue of stu
dents being dissatisfied with its am
bience, especially after major reno
vations completed just over two
years ago.
"It's brought in a different
crowd," said Flo Nocar, a shift
manager who graduated from
Stanford last year. "I think people
used to look at it as a homier kind
of place."
Rodriguez also acknowl
edged that many students
now negatively describe the
Coffee House as "sterile."
"I talked to a couple of people
for parent's weekend who said,
'This is like walking into McDon
ald's'," Rodriguez said.
With Maxwell's position gone,
some have raised concerns that
the Coffee House will not be able
to improve.
"I don't think the Co Ho has
the priority in the central of fice to
bring it back to life," Akchin said.
"[Upper management] certainly
can't expect me or any student to

be a creative driver."
Maxwell said that he was not
able to institute modifications be
cause of the economic situation
during his term as manager.
"The nit is so deep that I wasn't
able to implement my plans, and now
I'm not there," he said.
He also saw students as notably
uninvolved in making the
changes they wanted at the Coffee
House, especially in light of sur
veys being taken at other venues,
such as the Tree House.
"The Co Ho is making changes
not driven by the students,"
Maxwell said. "If students want to
make the changes, students
would need to come forward."
Leeroy Fitch, the director of
retail at Tresidder Union, will
now be overseeing the Coffee
House.
"[Fitch is] just going to be
doing what he's been doing, but
now he's just going to be focused
towards the Coffee House," Ro
driguez said, emphasizing that it
is misleading to think that the
Coffee House is now without a
manager.
For the Coffee House's first
seven years of operation, it did

not have its own manager, a
practice that Rodriguez de
scribed as "industry standard."
The position was only created
three years ago when competi
tion increased.
Rodriguez also said that broad
er decisions about the Coffee
I louse have always been handled
by him and Bon Appetit's district
manager.
"In fact what we have done is
going to improve what we are
doing," he said. "We were over
working the manager at the Cof
fee House," whom Rodriguez
described as so busy with taking
care of shifts that he was not able
to contribute to giving direction.
Furthermore, Rodriguez stat
ed that management is aware of
student concern about the Coffee
House's feel and is currently
working to change it. He cited col
laboration with the ASSU Senate
as well as dialogue with students
regarding the cafe's mural.
"The final design [after the
renovations] is not maybe what it
should have been," lie said.
"We're trying to give it some of
that atmosphere back, so it looks
not so sterile."
The management of Bon Appetit — the
company that runs the Coffee House —
laid off manager Dan Maxwell several weeks
ago due to a lac k of financial resources.
Some people associated with the Coffee
House see this move as symptomatic of larg
er problems confronting the campus cafe.
Critics have cited a lack of creative direction
and a sanitized environment. Some people
would like to see the Coffee House changed
to feel more like it did before its renovation
several years ago.
Bon Appetit, however, says that it is tak
ing steps to adapt the Coffee House to re
flect students' desires despite recent cut
backs and that eliminating the position of
Coffee House manager will only serve cus

tomers better.
"[Revenue] has dropped in the last three
years by easily a quarter," said Marvin Ro
driguez, head of Bon Appetit at Stanford,
citing competition from other campus
venues such as smaller cafes and the Tree

House.
Rodriguez stressed the deci
sion to lay off Maxwell was moti
vated completely by finances.
"He was performing well, but if
Maxwell stayed we had to cut
down somewhere and that meant
longer lines," Rodriguez said.
Bon Appetit also recently elim
inated a managerial position in its
catering department at Stanford.
Under the new arrangement,
several shift managers have as
sumed Maxwell's former duties.
"I'm handling the personnel is
sues that [Maxwell] used to take
care of, assigning breaks and tasks,
and holding the crew together,"
said junior Jonny Akchin, who
now works as a shift manager.
