# SLAC protests for parents
## 
### ERIKKA INNES STAFF WRITER 
Friday afternoon, 150 students and Universi
ty workers gathered around the fountain in front
of Memorial Auditorium to stage a peaceful
protest. Wearing duct tape across their mouths to
— according to rally organizers — symbolize
their lack ofvoice in campus politics, students and
workers silently held up banners with messages
like, "Worker and student voices have been si
lenced. Code of Conduct NOW!"
The demonstration was organized by the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition and the
Coalition for Labor Justice to educate parents
about campus worker issues. Demonstrators
handed out informational fliers to parents
that described their problems with Stanford's
current policies.
The fliers also provided the coalition's solu
tion to current problems with Stanford policy,
which they called their Code of Conduct. The
goal of the Code of Conduct, according to the
fliers, is to have workers, students and the ad
ministration develop an acceptable set of guide

lines for worker issues such as living wages, full
benefits for Stanford employees, freedom to
form a union and a moratorium on subcon
tracting positions.
According to SLAC press representative
Molly Goldberg, the administration original
ly agreed to meet with student representa
tives and workers to discuss the possibility of
creating the Code of Conduct. Later the ad
ministration decided that workers would not
be permitted to join the discussions.
"The administration is not willing to meet with
workers, unionized or un-unionized," Goldberg
said. "We do not want to meet without workers
present, and we're not willing to be flexible on
that point."
Stanford Hospital worker Robert Valenzuela
said University President John Hen nessy refused
to discuss wages directly with workers.
"He refuses to talk with the workers and allow
them to be involved in discussions about their
wages," Valenzuela said. "We're going to keep
fighting until we win. We won't give up."
Dean of Students Marc Wilis said
he was happy with certain aspects of
the protest.
"I appreciate that it is a respectful
protest," Wais said.

Hennessy was unavailable for
comment.
Although many parents de
clined comment, one mother,
Judith Kellogg Liebert, found
the demonstration informative.
"We knew nothing about this
issue prior to our arrival this morn
ing," Liebert said.
Her daughter, freshman Beth

Liebert, said that as a Stanford
student she had heard little about
the issue. "I didn't know anything,"
Liebert said.
After parents had filed in to
Memorial Auditorium to hear Hen
nessy give a welcoming speech,
SLAC member lan Slatteiy thanked
the demonstrators for coming, and
the protest broke up quietly.
