Until Saturday, nobody had uttered the
phrase. Ii was a hush-hush term — a Stanford
basketball faux-pas. Although it might have
crossed the players' minds at some point, no one
had dared to say it.

LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Casey Jacobsen's 24 point-performance on Saturday wasn't enough, as
No. 10 Stanford lost to UCLA, 95-92. The Cardinal will finish the season
with tough games at Arizona and Arizona State.
However, because it lost both games, the Car
dinal (17-8, 10-6 Pac-10), which is tied for fifth in
the Pac-10 and two games back of frontrunner
Oregon, will have to earn that victory in the
desert or run the table in the conference tourna
ment at Staples ("enter in two weeks. If it doesn't,
its string of seven "Big Dance" appearances just
might be in jeopardy.
It's not to say that Stanford didn't put up a
valiant effort to come back from a practically insur
mountable margin against the Bruins in front of a
sold-out crowd at Maples Pavilion. Trailing by 17
points with four minutes left, the Cardinal cut the
lead to only five with 30 seconds left.
Two nights after falling to Southern California
by 19 points, the rally was the only bright spot in the
demoralizing defeat.
"It's a lot less harder to take than it would've
been if we hadn't fought back," junior center Cur
tis Borchardt said. "But once you get to that point
of the game, there's not hing to lose."
Up to that point, it was as if there was a lid on the
rim on the west end of the court. The Cardinal
missed 16 straight 3-pointers at one point in the
second half and scored only two field goals in a 13-
minute stretch as it watched UCLA cushion its lead.
In fact, Stanford attempted a school-record 42 3-
pointers and only made 14, six of which came in the
final four minutes.
"We sure couldn't shoot the ball," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "We really lost our
confidence and everybody was trying to drive
against the zone. We tried a lot of different people
and not many of them had a lot of confidence.
We're just not playing well enough to win games
like this right now."
It didn't help that Borchardt, who tallied his
12th double-double of the season with 17 points
and 14 rebounds, was rendered almost a non-factor
for most of the game. UCLA played an impenetra
ble 2-3 zone defense, making it hard for Borchardt
to post on Bruins' senior center Dan Gadzuric.
"They collapsed down in the middle. We
couldn't find any passing lanes to get me the ball,"
Borchardt said. "That's okay if we can step up and
make those threes, but they just didn't fall."
Stanford allowed a UCLA team that had scored

just 51 points two nights earlier to score 49 points
in the first half alone. The Bruins scored on nine
straight possessions in the early going, and then
scored on eight consecutive possessions before
heading to the locker room, including an off-bal
ance 3-pointer by UCLA senior guard Billy
Knight at the buzzer.
" They never should have gotten a shot off,"
Montgomery said. "We just can't do that. We have
to be smarter and recognize those circumstances."

It didn't help that Borchardt, who tallied his
12th double-double of the season with 17 points
and 14 rebounds, was rendered almost a non-factor
for most of the game. UCLA played an impenetra
ble 2-3 zone defense, making it hard for Borchardt
to post on Bruins' senior center Dan Gadzuric.
"They collapsed down in the middle. We
couldn't find any passing lanes to get me the ball,"
Borchardt said. "That's okay if we can step up and
make those threes, but they just didn't fall."
Stanford allowed a UCLA team that had scored

just 51 points two nights earlier to score 49 points
in the first half alone. The Bruins scored on nine
straight possessions in the early going, and then
scored on eight consecutive possessions before
heading to the locker room, including an off-bal
ance 3-pointer by UCLA senior guard Billy
Knight at the buzzer.
" They never should have gotten a shot off,"
Montgomery said. "We just can't do that. We have
to be smarter and recognize those circumstances."
Freshman point guard Chris Hernandez almost

Freshman point guard Chris Hernandez scored a ca

in Stanford's 95-92 loss to UCLA on Saturday.
single-handedly brought Stan
ford back in the final four min

points on three 3-pointers and
made two steals down the stretch.
Down 89-83 with 45 seconds

from UCLA freshman guard
Ryan Walcott and drove fora
layup, which was blocked by
Bruin junior wingman Jason
Kapono. Despite pleading from
the crowd and the Stanford
bench, no foul was called, and the
Cardinal's improbable run came
to an end.
"I just hope the guys don't lose
their confidence," Montgomery
said. "We've got our work cut out
for us. Everything that we want to
accomplish is still ahead of us but
we're going to have to really dig
down and get better."
Until Saturday, nobody had uttered the
phrase. Ii was a hush-hush term — a Stanford
basketball faux-pas. Although it might have
crossed the players' minds at some point, no one
had dared to say it.

But when Stanford's 95-92 loss to UCLA was com
plete, and when the players reflected on the potential
for disaster in Arizona next week, junior guard Julius
Barnes actually voiced the unmentionable.
"If that's the scenario — four losses in a row —
we could say hello to the N.1.T.," he said.
N.1.T.? Wow.
How scary. How unimaginable. How sad.
Jnst one week ago, Stanford's players were
speaking of a possible regular-season conference
championship, of their mighty struggle back to
the top of the Pac-10 and of their four wins in a
row. Their minds were set on a strong seed in
the NCAA Tournament and of the peaking na
ture of the team.
But now?
Uh-oh. This is where things get dicey.
I he two home games against the Los Angeles
schools had been opportunities for Stanford to
gain its 18th victory and its 1 ltli conference win,
the unofficial benchmarks on which to gauge an
NCAA berth.

Casey Jacobsen's 24 point-performance on Saturday wasn't enough, as
No. 10 Stanford lost to UCLA, 95-92. The Cardinal will finish the season
with tough games at Arizona and Arizona State.
However, because it lost both games, the Car
dinal (17-8, 10-6 Pac-10), which is tied for fifth in
the Pac-10 and two games back of frontrunner
Oregon, will have to earn that victory in the
desert or run the table in the conference tourna
ment at Staples ("enter in two weeks. If it doesn't,
its string of seven "Big Dance" appearances just
might be in jeopardy.
It's not to say that Stanford didn't put up a
valiant effort to come back from a practically insur
mountable margin against the Bruins in front of a
sold-out crowd at Maples Pavilion. Trailing by 17
points with four minutes left, the Cardinal cut the
lead to only five with 30 seconds left.
Two nights after falling to Southern California
by 19 points, the rally was the only bright spot in the
demoralizing defeat.
"It's a lot less harder to take than it would've
been if we hadn't fought back," junior center Cur
tis Borchardt said. "But once you get to that point
of the game, there's not hing to lose."
Up to that point, it was as if there was a lid on the
rim on the west end of the court. The Cardinal
missed 16 straight 3-pointers at one point in the
second half and scored only two field goals in a 13-
minute stretch as it watched UCLA cushion its lead.
In fact, Stanford attempted a school-record 42 3-
pointers and only made 14, six of which came in the
final four minutes.
"We sure couldn't shoot the ball," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "We really lost our
confidence and everybody was trying to drive
against the zone. We tried a lot of different people
and not many of them had a lot of confidence.
We're just not playing well enough to win games
like this right now."
