Until Saturday, nobody had uttered the
phrase. Ii was a hush-hush term — a Stanford
basketball faux-pas. Although it might have
crossed the players' minds at some point, no one
had dared to say it.

Saturday: No. 25 UCLA 95, No. 10
Stanford 92

But when Stanford's 95-92 loss to UCLA was com
plete, and when the players reflected on the potential
for disaster in Arizona next week, junior guard Julius
Barnes actually voiced the unmentionable.
"If that's the scenario — four losses in a row —
we could say hello to the N.1.T.," he said.
N.1.T.? Wow.
How scary. How unimaginable. How sad.
Jnst one week ago, Stanford's players were
speaking of a possible regular-season conference
championship, of their mighty struggle back to
the top of the Pac-10 and of their four wins in a
row. Their minds were set on a strong seed in
the NCAA Tournament and of the peaking na
ture of the team.
But now?
Uh-oh. This is where things get dicey.
I he two home games against the Los Angeles
schools had been opportunities for Stanford to
gain its 18th victory and its 1 ltli conference win,
the unofficial benchmarks on which to gauge an
NCAA berth.

Casey Jacobsen's 24 point-performance on Saturday wasn't enough, as
No. 10 Stanford lost to UCLA, 95-92. The Cardinal will finish the season
with tough games at Arizona and Arizona State.
