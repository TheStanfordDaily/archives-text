# Dance groups perform at Rhythms
## 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an instant, audience members at
last night's Rhythms show were trans
ported away from midterms, papers and
endless stacks of books as nine student
groups joined at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
to perform native dances from countries
around the world.
Colorful costumes and music from
Vanilla Ice to traditional Filipino sounds
filled the stage for two hours as over 100
participants from Ihe Stanford Hawai'i
Club, Capoeira, the Filipino American
Student Union, Salsa!, Ballet Folklorico,
Stanford Steppers and dvB entertained
the audience, as did groups performing
Indian dances.

Rhythms is a multi-cultural show
meant to celebrate the myriad of cul
tures and performing groups at Stan
ford. This year's performance was a ben
efit to fight world hunger.
"We have tried to make an effort to
include groups from diverse back
grounds that can expose the Stanford
students to various cultures through
doors of dance and music," said Rashi
Mittal, a Sanskriti special event officer.
Sanskriti, the undergraduate South
Asian organization, co-sponsored the
event with the Spoon Hunger Relief
Network. Mittal said they hoped to raise
$ 1,000, a large portion of which will go to
Oxfam.
This year Sanskriti co-sponsored with
Spoon because they wanted the money

to go to an organization that "will bring
smiles on the faces of many," Mittal said.
Before the performances, a repre
sentative from Spoon discussed the
effects of hunger in each of the coun
tries that would be represented in
dance that night.
"World hunger is one of humanity's
greatest failures," said Avi Kaza, a rep
resentative from Spoon. Kaza encour
aged everyone to help in the fight
against hunger. Nearly one in every
seven people in the world suffer from
hunger, he said.
"There is enough food produced in
the world to feed everyone, but not
everyone gets it," Kaza said.

A traditional Indian bharata natyam dance was one of many performances at this year's Rhythms show. The event was co-spon
sored by Sanskrit! and the Spoon Hunger Relief Network.
Rhythms first took place last win
ter; the student body was so sup
portive then that Sanskriti decided
to do it again — once again, to an
enthusiastic audience.
"I came even though I can't
dance because 1 love watching it
and 1 can experience it that way,"
junior Samira Khan said.
Khan loved watching the bharata
natyarn performance of "Bho
Shumbho," a classical Indian dance.
"It was beautiful and so foreign,"
she said. "It seemed so difficult, but
it was well orchestrated."
Sophomore Betsy Fields agreed
with Khan. "They were excellent. I
know they are specially trained and
it shows."
"Even though as individual cul
tures we stand distinct and separate,
when brought together we have so
much to offer," said Mittal. "More
importantly, we have so much to
learn from each other."
On March 2, twenty student
groups will host Mixed Beats, an in
ternational. multi-ethnic dance
party, at Tresidder Union stalling
at 10 p.m.
