# DeepC presents Body Image Week
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER 
Starting today, the Disordered Eating Ed
ucation 8c Prevention Council will present
"Body Image Week 2002," a series of events
and workshops to provide students with re
sources, information and discussions on how
to prevent eating disorders and help their
friends overcome body image issues.
The program is co-sponsored by the
Cowell Student Health Promotion Service
and the National Eating Disorders Associa
tion. It will bring professionals in nutrition
and eating disorders to campus to help in
crease awareness about these issues.
Body Image Week is part of a larger na
tionwide program provided by the associa
tion to prevent eating disorders in the Unit
ed States. The council, a student-run group,
has worked closely with Cowell to prepare
activities for the Stanford event.
The council was founded in the fall of
2000 as a response to the lack of awareness
about disordered eating on campus. Its main
goal this quarter is to pool resources to pre
sent students with more information about
disordered eating.
Body Image Week will present many dif
ferent aspects of disordered eating and body
image issues, offering a presentation on nu
trition as well as a workshop on body aware
ness and spirituality. A Thursday panel will
feature students discussing how they pre
vented disordered eating and helped friends
with eating disorders seek treatment. The
council is also planning a Friday event in
White Plaza that will help students to think
critically about body image issues.
Junior Natalie Wong, a staff member at
the Bridge, expressed interest in the week's
various workshops.
"[While] not that many people suffer
from severe eating disorders, there are

many different ways that women do not take
care of themselves in terms of eating and ex
ercise," Wong said. "This program seems
like a good way to get people informed about
eating and body image issues."
Senior Josephine Lau, financial manager
for the council, said that although the high
incidence of eating disorders on college cam
puses is well-publicized, the drive for perfec
tion at Stanford can exacerbate the problem.

MON, 7p.m., Toyon Hall:
"Answering the Questions,
Questioning the Answers"
Sarah Cunitz of Cowell Health Promotion Services provides
an overview and critical analysis of eating disorders and
body image issues on campus.
TUES, 7p.m., Robinson House:
"Nourishing Body and Soul"
Personal Life Coach Ali Berlin leads a workshop exploring
the connections between spirituality, disempowered body
image and self-defeating eating patterns.
WED, 6p.m., Lantana:
"Intuitive Eating"
Vivian Crisman, Cowell Health Promotion Services Nutri
tionist, teaches how to make healthy and satisfying food
decisions by listening to your body.
THURS, 7p.m., Gavilon:
"Student Perspectives"
A panel of students discuss how they avoided disordered
eating, helped friends cope with eating disorders and
managed to maintain a positive perspective, despite hav
ing experienced and felt vulnerable to pressures surround
ing body image.
FRI, 11a.m.- Ip.m., White Plaza:
Information on eating disorders and disordered eating;
body image; on and off-campus resources.
"The high concentration of
overachievers and perfectionists
on a college campus like Stanford
creates more disordered eating
and exercise problems than may
occur in other places," Lau said.
"I'eople have a mindset that if
they work hard enough, they will
achieve perfection. They then ex
tend this mindset towards their
own bodies, and this is where the
problems of over-exercising and
restricted eating can result," she
also noted.
It is estimated that up to 15
percent of young women in the
United States have substantially
disordered eating attitudes and
behaviors.
With increased awareness and
education programs such as
Body Image Week, the council
and the Cowell Health Promo
tion Service are hoping to reduce
this percentage in the Stanford
community.
The council's past events have
included a flyer campaign on cam
pus to get people to think critical
ly about body image issues.
