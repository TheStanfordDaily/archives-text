# What is Kingscote, anyway?

Tucked away in the center of campus is a place to live
that doesn't smell like overcooked broccoli; a place
where no signs ad< >rn the doors telling who resides with
in; a place that was built when functionality was not ar
chitects' only concern and when "ornamental" was ac
tually in.
Hie place is Kingscote Gardens, a largely unknown
apartment building located next to the Faculty Club
and across from Bechtel International Center. A small
sign informs passers-by of its presence but not its pur

ness reveals nothing.
Kingscote, built in 1917, was originally meant to pro

call home for several years. Today's Kingscote popula

graduates number only five and graduate students
around 10. Visiting faculty still come for short-term

Nicholls described the upside to the rather Spartan
accommodations.
"You tend to remind yourself that space isn't
everything when you don't have to pay rent in Palo

Though residents do not receive free rent, the
below-market rates that Kingscote otters are attractive.
Fora student, living at Kingscote is slightly more ex
pensive than University housing, and most of the rooms
are studios. For residents who work or go to class on
campus, the location is perfect.
"You feel removed from the rest of campus, but in
reality, you're dead center," said junior Scott Cannon.
But Kingscote's charm springs from more than
just a mere tally of its advantages weighed against its
disadvantages. Something less tangible and perhaps
more important creates an atmosphere that people
