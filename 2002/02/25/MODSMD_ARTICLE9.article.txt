# What is Kingscote, anyway?
## 
### JENNY MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tucked away in the center of campus is a place to live
that doesn't smell like overcooked broccoli; a place
where no signs ad< >rn the doors telling who resides with
in; a place that was built when functionality was not ar
chitects' only concern and when "ornamental" was ac
tually in.
Hie place is Kingscote Gardens, a largely unknown
apartment building located next to the Faculty Club
and across from Bechtel International Center. A small
sign informs passers-by of its presence but not its pur
pose, and the driveway sloping down into lush green
ness reveals nothing.
Kingscote, built in 1917, was originally meant to pro
vide a place that visiting faculty and their spouses could
call home for several years. Today's Kingscote popula
tion, though, is quite diverse — comprised of students,
faculty, staff and others affiliated with Stanford. Under
graduates number only five and graduate students
around 10. Visiting faculty still come for short-term
stays, according to Kingscote manager Susan Nicholls.
She said she tries especially hard to accommodate visi
tors from overseas, "just to keep with what the building
was originally intended for."

Despite Kingscote's central location, il is an indepen
dent apartment building that does not participate in the
Stanford housing lotteiy system. Kingscote rooms, with
their paper-thin walls and lack of modern appliances,
are less than luxurious. And the entire square footage of
a studio can only hope to equal the total closet space of
an Oak Creek suite.
Nicholls described the upside to the rather Spartan
accommodations.
"You tend to remind yourself that space isn't
everything when you don't have to pay rent in Palo
Alto," she said.
Though residents do not receive free rent, the
below-market rates that Kingscote otters are attractive.
Fora student, living at Kingscote is slightly more ex
pensive than University housing, and most of the rooms
are studios. For residents who work or go to class on
campus, the location is perfect.
"You feel removed from the rest of campus, but in
reality, you're dead center," said junior Scott Cannon.
But Kingscote's charm springs from more than
just a mere tally of its advantages weighed against its
disadvantages. Something less tangible and perhaps
more important creates an atmosphere that people
respond to.
"It's its own little world," said ju
nior Amber Rais.
junior Robert Owens agreed
"It's very quaint and quiet here,"
Owens said.
Green, calm, serene. The adjec
tives that come to mind when de
scribing Kingscote's grounds are
not ones associated with many other
places on campus. With its spread
ing gl ass, pond, and its buffer of tall
hedges and trees, Kingscote seems a
world apart.
That is, until somebody ca

reens down the driveway on a
skateboard, or a group of stu
dents cuts across the front of the
building, laughing and talking
loudly — reminders that
Kingscote is, in fact, on a college
campus. This reality is even more
evident at other times, according
to Nicholls.
"It can be noisy here on week
ends," Nichols said, mentioning
parties at Tresidder Union, Bechtel
International Center and drum
ming in the New Guinea Sculpture
Garden as the main causes.
But lor the most part, Kingscote
is an oasis — a mossy haven from
the terracotta and sandstone, a
refuge from bustle of criss-crossing
bikes, pedestrians and cars. And

though Nicholls said that "[the] en
vironment is definitely non-social,"
students said this is changing.
"Tilings are starling to pick up,"
said senior Steven Brown. "It's just
now starting to become more stu
dent-oriented."
Since students who move in
have usually found out about va
cancies from other students they
know in the building, it's not sur
prising that an expanding stu
dent population could mean an
improving social atmosphere. Se
nior Brady Beaubien said his
brother Layne was one of the first
undergraduates to live in
Kingscote four years ago. He also
said that almost every undergrad
uate who lives in the building

now can be traced back to his
brother, directly or indirectly.
"It's the ultimate expression of
the game of telephone," Beaubi
en said.
Whether Kingscote will eventu
ally become all-student housing, or
whether the University — which
bought the building in 1996 — has
some other purpose in mind is any
one's guess.
"Someday I'm sure they'll deter
mine a new use for this building,"
Nicholls said.
Until that day, thin walls,
cramped quarters and Saturday
night drumming can't keep in
quiries about vacancies from
pouring in. There's just some
thing about Kingscote.

Kingscote Gardens, located near the Faculty Club, may be Stanford's best
kept secret. With a diverse population of faculty, staff, students and other
Stanford affiliates, Kingscote is an unusual alternative to more conventional
housing options.

just a mere tally of its advantages weighed against its
disadvantages. Something less tangible and perhaps
more important creates an atmosphere that people
respond to.
"It's its own little world," said ju
nior Amber Rais.
junior Robert Owens agreed
"It's very quaint and quiet here,"
Owens said.
Green, calm, serene. The adjec
tives that come to mind when de
scribing Kingscote's grounds are
not ones associated with many other
places on campus. With its spread
ing gl ass, pond, and its buffer of tall
hedges and trees, Kingscote seems a
world apart.
That is, until somebody ca

reens down the driveway on a
skateboard, or a group of stu
dents cuts across the front of the
building, laughing and talking
loudly — reminders that
Kingscote is, in fact, on a college
campus. This reality is even more
evident at other times, according
to Nicholls.
"It can be noisy here on week
ends," Nichols said, mentioning
parties at Tresidder Union, Bechtel
International Center and drum
ming in the New Guinea Sculpture
Garden as the main causes.
But lor the most part, Kingscote
is an oasis — a mossy haven from
the terracotta and sandstone, a
refuge from bustle of criss-crossing
bikes, pedestrians and cars. And

though Nicholls said that "[the] en
vironment is definitely non-social,"
students said this is changing.
"Tilings are starling to pick up,"
said senior Steven Brown. "It's just
now starting to become more stu
dent-oriented."
Since students who move in
have usually found out about va
cancies from other students they
know in the building, it's not sur
prising that an expanding stu
dent population could mean an
improving social atmosphere. Se
nior Brady Beaubien said his
brother Layne was one of the first
undergraduates to live in
Kingscote four years ago. He also
said that almost every undergrad
uate who lives in the building

now can be traced back to his
brother, directly or indirectly.
"It's the ultimate expression of
the game of telephone," Beaubi
en said.
Whether Kingscote will eventu
ally become all-student housing, or
whether the University — which
bought the building in 1996 — has
some other purpose in mind is any
one's guess.
"Someday I'm sure they'll deter
mine a new use for this building,"
Nicholls said.
Until that day, thin walls,
cramped quarters and Saturday
night drumming can't keep in
quiries about vacancies from
pouring in. There's just some
thing about Kingscote.

Kingscote Gardens, located near the Faculty Club, may be Stanford's best
kept secret. With a diverse population of faculty, staff, students and other
Stanford affiliates, Kingscote is an unusual alternative to more conventional
housing options.
Tucked away in the center of campus is a place to live
that doesn't smell like overcooked broccoli; a place
where no signs ad< >rn the doors telling who resides with
in; a place that was built when functionality was not ar
chitects' only concern and when "ornamental" was ac
tually in.
Hie place is Kingscote Gardens, a largely unknown
apartment building located next to the Faculty Club
and across from Bechtel International Center. A small
sign informs passers-by of its presence but not its pur
pose, and the driveway sloping down into lush green
ness reveals nothing.
Kingscote, built in 1917, was originally meant to pro
vide a place that visiting faculty and their spouses could
call home for several years. Today's Kingscote popula
tion, though, is quite diverse — comprised of students,
faculty, staff and others affiliated with Stanford. Under
graduates number only five and graduate students
around 10. Visiting faculty still come for short-term
stays, according to Kingscote manager Susan Nicholls.
She said she tries especially hard to accommodate visi
tors from overseas, "just to keep with what the building
was originally intended for."

Despite Kingscote's central location, il is an indepen
dent apartment building that does not participate in the
Stanford housing lotteiy system. Kingscote rooms, with
their paper-thin walls and lack of modern appliances,
are less than luxurious. And the entire square footage of
a studio can only hope to equal the total closet space of
an Oak Creek suite.
Nicholls described the upside to the rather Spartan
accommodations.
"You tend to remind yourself that space isn't
everything when you don't have to pay rent in Palo
Alto," she said.
Though residents do not receive free rent, the
below-market rates that Kingscote otters are attractive.
Fora student, living at Kingscote is slightly more ex
pensive than University housing, and most of the rooms
are studios. For residents who work or go to class on
campus, the location is perfect.
"You feel removed from the rest of campus, but in
reality, you're dead center," said junior Scott Cannon.
