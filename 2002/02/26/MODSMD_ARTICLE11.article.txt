# Mutant Mexican corn
## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Scientists have recently discov
ered mutant corn among native
species in remote mountain re
gions of Oaxaca, Mexico. Muta
tions are nothing abnormal, but
this particular transgenic corn had
foreign genes, including a gene
from an insect-killing bacterium
called Bacillus thuringenesis.
It is unclear how this occurred,
since the closest plantation was 60
miles away and Mexico has
banned all genetically engineered
crops since 1998.
Although conspiracy theorists
may think otherwise, scientists be
lieve these mutants arose from far
away pollination.
The hydrogen and oxygen
constituents of water can be sepa
rated and the hydrogen compo
nent can be used as a source of
fuel. Plants do this process
through photosynthesis. Human
made photocatalysts have been
less successful, functioning only
with ultraviolet light, which only
makes up 4 percent of sunlight.
Japanese researchers, howev
er, have found a solution. They
added nickel to a metal oxide,
yielding a substance that allows
more efficient photosynthesis.
Could this be the alternative when
we run out of fossil fuels?
Have you ever seen an ultra
sound of a womb with the baby
wiggling inside? Well, a study
from Mayo Clinic researchers

suggests there might be a reason
for wiggling.
An ultrasound scan produces
volumes of up to 100 decibels. The
fetus would perceive this noise,
perhaps not as a loud shriek, but
as a tap very close to the ear. Ba
bies under ultrasound therefore
move more than usual, in reaction
to the sound.
The study did not indicate any
risk to the child. Since the sound is
very localized, the baby can easily
twist out of earshot.
Researchers have shown that
painting all buildings white
would reflect enough sunlight to
reduce the Greenhouse Effect by
close to 25 percent. Another study
showed that doing so would also
have a positive effect on pollution.
Titanium dioxide, the princi
pal component of white paint, is
an efficient photocatalyst. It ab
sorbs sunlight and produces liy
droxyl radicals that can attack or
ganic: and inorganic molecules, in
cluding carbon dioxide. In fact, ti
tanium dioxide has been used for
over 30 years to kill bacteria on
hospital surfaces and to treat con
taminated water.
Authors of the study warned,
however, that this is no magical
cure for pollution. Paving roads
and coating buildings with titani
um dioxide would be expensive,
considering it absorbs only small
quantities of sunlight.
Using DNA microarrays to di
agnose patients could become
one of the most effective applica

tions of genetics.
Also known as DNA or gene
chips, microarrays can detect spe
cific genes and measure gene ac
tivity in an individual. Drug com
panies have been using microar
rays to study cancer and other
complex diseases.
Microarrays can be used as
quick diagnostic and prognostic
tools, allowing doctors to prescribe
medication best adapted to each
individual patient. This could re
place the standard one-size-fits-all
approach to medicine.
Have you ever found your In
ternet connection to be simply too
slow? Since increasing broadband
connections is very expensive, the
solution might be to utilize systems
that are already highly developed.
This would mean using electri
cal wiring to conduct digital signals.
Power lines are almost Ã¼biquitous,
reaching farther and deeper than
telephone lines. A simple adapter
could filter unwanted signals.
The biggest challenge to ac hiev
ing this phenomenon is that not
every country could benefit equal
ly because of the fact that each
country uses different power
grids. For example, the United
States uses many small transform
ers to provide power for large
buildings, while most of Europe
uses a single large one. Europe's
system is in fact more efficient for
conducting digital signals.
