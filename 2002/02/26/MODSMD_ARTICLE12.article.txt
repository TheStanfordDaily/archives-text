## The 						Stanford Daily Mixed-gender grad roommates should be allowed 
### 
Published Since J 891

In January the Graduate Student Coun
cil issued a report on the quality of life
for graduate students at Stanford that
discussed, among other things, several
deficiencies in the on-campus housing policy:
the prohibition of single mixed-gender
roommates and the lack of sufficient incen
tive to choose a roommate rather than enter
the lottery alone. By amending these policies,
the University can take strides toward in
creasing the satisfaction that graduate stu
dents receive from their housing.
Currently Stanford allows male and female
roommate pairs only if the pair is a couple, in
which case they are assigned to one-bedroom
housing. If a student wishes to live with a
roommate of the opposite sex and the two are
not dating or married, they must enter the
lottery as a couple and have no opportunity to
share a two-bedroom apartment.

This is an old policy, and Stanford's reasons
for maintaining it are probably twofold. First,
mixed-gender roommates were not nearly as
common when Stanford instituted the policy,
so a moral imperative was attached to the de
cision. Second, the University probably does
not want to give away precious two-bedroom
apartments to couples who enter the lottery as
single roommates, an occurrence that could
happen quite often given the desirability of
the larger two-bedroom apartments.
When viewed as a moral issue, this policy is
anachronistic and unfair. Graduate students
are mature enough to make decisions about
their living situation, and while we do not
think students should be involuntarily paired
with a stranger of the opposite sex, they
should have the right to choose an opposite
sex roommate.
While Student Housing Services does its

best to designate random roommate pairs
who complement one another, students will
always be better equipped to choose their liv
ing partner, and the option of choosing a
roommate from either sex just provides
more options.
As an efficiency issue, the restriction of
roommate choice is unfair, and, according to
the report, a change could even alleviate the
shortage of couples' housing. Couples' hous
ing is often too small to adequately house
two working students, along with two desks
and two computers.
As long as all the housing spaces are being
used efficiently, it should not matter to whom
the one-bedroom and two-bedroom apart
< rnents are allocated. Giving roommate pairs
the option to inhabit two-bedroom apart
ments would help the demand for couples
housing, which is rather severe.

We also join with the GSC in asking the
University to increase the incentive for choos
ing to enter the lottery with a roommate. Cur
rently, "one's chances of receiving a desired
assignment are not improved by applying in a
group with one or more other students."
If Student Housing Services built some in
centive into the housing lottery to encourage
applying for housing in a group, many stu
dents would choose to form a group of peo
ple who they can live with more compatibly.
This could bring about fewer complaints
about roommate conflicts.
We urge the University to institute these
important changes prior to this spring's
housing lottery. By observing student input
and following the constructive recommenda
tions concerning graduate on-campus hous
ing, Stanford can easily and cheaply improve
the living experience for graduate students.
