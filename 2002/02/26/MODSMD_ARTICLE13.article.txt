# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Dogs can improve lives 
### 
Everyone who's ever had a really
bad day at Stanford, raise your
hands. Keep them high, now.
Wow. That many? Well, see, you
prove my point. Its for people like you and
me that we need more dogs at Stanford.
A dog is basically a living, breathing bad
day buster. It worked all the time for me in

high school. I'd open the
front door of my house,
upset over a bad grade, or
a frustrating day at prac
tice or any one of the
dozen petty things that
gel yon down. And my
dog would bound up,
clearly thrilled to see me.
"Let's go fora walk, Josh!

Let's play fetch, Josh! Hell, lei's do any
thing! I'm just so happy to see you!" You
can't help but feel just a little bit better after
being greeted by your dog.
There's no equivalent to a dog's affec
tion anywhere in the human world. No
one — not your roommate, your girl
friend or boyfriend, not even your par
ents — will ever give you the uncondi
tional love that your dog will. They won't
be overjoyed to see you day in and day
out, regardless of the circumstances.
And (unless you have a really hungry
and pathetic roommate), none of the
above people will think you're the great
est guy in the universe if you give them
some left-over chicken as a special treat.
And for these reasons, we need more
dogs at Stanford. At minimum, a (log
should be an integral part of the residen
tial education system. Every resident fel
low should be required to have a dog, if for
no other purpose than to make stressed
out students' lives a little more cheerful.
No offense to the freshman RAsout there,
but even you guys won't fetch a ball over
and over or let a frazzled resident scratch
your ears. A dog will, and will love every
minute of it.
Also, dogs bring a dorm together. 1 dis
tinctly remember one evening last spring
in Toyon. We were watching a movie in
the Hating Clubs when a collie came tun
ning out from behind a couch. We
weren't quite sure where she came from,
but in any event, after the movie she fol
lowed us right back into the dorm. With
in seconds, people were poking their
heads out of doors, coming out into the
hallways, both amused and excited to see
a dog trotting through the dorm. Some of
these people were serious, CS-type stu

dents, the kind of people who would
calmly keep coding in their rooms
through the middle of a 7.0 earthquake.
Others were extremely hot girls, the kind
of people who normally wouldn't give us
the time of day. And a humble dog
brought them all together.
Stanford cross country coach Vin
Lananna knows the value of a dog. He
sometimes brings his dog Scooby to
practice, to romp around on the IM
fields or golf course while we're running
intervals. Something about Scooby's
pure joy at being out there, running
through the grass, makes practice go
easier. You look at him, clearly having
the time of his life, and you find yourself
caught up in his enthusiasm.
Don't even get me started on cats. If
dogs are man's best friend, then cats are
man's casual acquaintance. They'll ac
knowledge your presence, maybe even
purr once in a while, but there's no real
warmth or affection. Whenever I hear
about those old ladies who leave their en
tire estate to their cats, I can't help but
think that it's a good thing cats don't un
derstand estate law. If they did, the old
ladies wouldn't stand a chance. They'd
come home from the Bingo game, and
Fluffy would be waiting. One quick
pounce, a claw throat, and the
deed would be done. In the end, a cat is
out for himself. A dog is out for you.
So let's see more dogs at Stanford. Let's
see the Twain I errier tag out the Bui bank
Basset Hound in next year's game of mid
night capture-the-flag in the Quad. Let's
see the Lambda Nu Labrador Retriever
woofing it up at their next party. Let's give
Haus Mitt a German Shepherd, Slav Dom
a Russian Wolfhound and La Maison
Frangaise a French poodle.
Mark Twain once said, "Heaven goes
by favor. If it went by merit, you'd stay
out and your dog would go in." There's a
lot of truth to that. Stanford is filled with
amazing, wonderful people, but they are
only human. We could use more of the
unique canine spirit, that unconditional
devotion and enthusiasm that no human
can provide. If need be, the ASSU can
even set up a special fee fora campus
wide Milk-Bone fund. After all, isn't that
a small price to pay?

Josh Sohn is a junior majoring in political sci
ence. Ile would like to remind his brother to wa/l<
Katama, their German Shepherd, more often.
