'Continued opposition between Iran and
United States benefits neither side'
Ben Jones's letter of Feb. 25 raised a
number of interesting issues regarding
how the United States should handle na
tions that sponsor terrorism and terror
ists themselves. Jones is right about the
potential dangers of nuclear weapons
proliferation, but 1 think he fails to un
derstand that underlying Bush's state
ment appears to be a desire fora war
against, at the very least, Iraq. It is not
simply rhetoric. Unwarranted intimida
tion such as Bush's unnecessary postur
ing is only more likely to encourage
states such as Iran or North Korea to act
against the United States.
I completely agree with Jones's
premise that actions dictated by morality
are insufficient to ensure our national se
curity. The United States, which has
long been one of the primary sponsors of
terrorism around the world — from
Latin America to East. Asia — has long
recognized this, even if the majority of its
citizens remain blissfully unaware.
In fact, the military maintains a school
in Georgia at Fort Benning, known as
the School of the Americas. The mission
of this school is to train guerrilla insur
gents. The graduates of this school are a
veritable who's who of Latin American
terror, from Manuel Noriega, the for
mer Latin American dictator in jail for
drug trafficking, and Robert IVAubuis
son, who stands accused of leading death
squads in El Salvador. This example
should illustrate the point that, although
Americans are wide-eyed at the thought
of states sponsoring terrorism as a tool of
warfare, we ourselves have been doing it
for more than GO years now.

What does all this mean for practical
matters of national security? Jones's state
ment that Iran or a nation like it might
launch nuclear weapons at our allies in the
Middle East seems somewhat absurd.
The deterrent to that is simply to place
them under our nuclear umbrella as we
did Western Europe during the Cold
War. It hardly seems plausible that Iran
or Iraq would launch nuclear weapons at
Israel given the immediate American re
sponse, or that any nation-state would
use nuclear weapons first, given global
opinion that would virtually automatical
ly countenance the total destruction of
that nation. I seriously doubt that there
are statesmen in the world who are not
aware of that.
The question then becomes one of
strategic interest. The continued opposi
tion between Iran and the United States
benefits neither side. However, Iranian
opinion, both public and political, had not
previously been subjected to sufficient
pressure to cause a change in policy. In
fact, neither had American opinion.
Sept. 11 may very well have applied
that pressure. If Iran has not suddenly
become the model state, that should not
discourage a country that aligned itself
with the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio
Somoza. Improving relations further is
simply a matter of defining aims and in
terests, and identifying the manner in
which to achieve them. Backing nations
that are already against the wall even fur
ther back hardly seems intelligent. A wolf
will only attack a more dangerous animal
if it is starving.
The answer for states such as Iran lies in
some sort of incentive program for good
behavior. We help them economically in
exchange fora lessening of tensions or a

nuclear test ban. The probable success
rate of such tactics is much higher than
sheer intimidation
This brings us to Jones's most pointed
observation, regarding rules of engage
ment for terror networks. The United
States' reaction to Sept. 11 has likely in
sured that no nation will consider spon
soring such activities. The United States,
for the first time in all the examples Jones
cites, has forcibly responded to terrorism.
While the prospect of nuclear
weapons falling into terrorists' hands is a
horrifying one, we can best discourage it
by being friendly to legitimate nation
states and "draining the swamps," such as
Afghanistan and the Sudan, countries
with limited state structures, thus ripe for
terrorist inhabitation. In short, it is not
the diagnosis that is wrong, but the im
plied prescription.
