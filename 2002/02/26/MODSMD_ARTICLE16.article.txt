WOMEN'S TENNIS
Saturday: No. 3 Sfanford
defeats No. 14 California, 7-0

Stanford (8-1, 1-0) lost a
match and the top spot in the
polls to then-N0.5 Georgia at
the learn Indoors two weeks
ago in Madison, Wis., and has
been working hard since then to
prove that it is still the best team
in the country.
The recovery of senior Lau
ren Kalvaria from an injury has
helped spark the team's current
three-match winning streak.
Although the team was not
surprised that it beat the Bears,
the Cardinal was nonetheless
excited by how decisively it de
feated a talented Bears squad.
"They're a great team, and
they're always psyched up for
Stanford," Barnikow said. "It's a
huge victory."

On an afternoon that saw a
two-hour rain delay interrupt
play, Stanford got out to an early
1-0 lead by taking the first two
doubles matches.
Kalvaria and senior Gabriela
Lastra, the nation's No. 2 dou
bles team, knocked off Raquel
Kops-Jones and Jody Scheldt, 8-
3. The No. 8 duo of Barnikow
and freshman Erin Burdette
put away Carla Arguelles and
Nicole Havlicek, 8-4.
In third-flight doubles,
Christina Fusano and Jieun Ja
cobs edged Stanford's duo of
senior Keiko Tokuda and
freshman Story Tweedie-
Yates, 9-8 (9).
The Cardinal carried the
positive momentum into singles
play, taking all six matches.
"We obviously get psyched
up to play Cal," sophomore
Emilia Anderson said. "There
was some extra motivation."
Kalvaria, ranked No. 11 na
tionally in singles, outlasted No.
40 Kops-Jones in first-flight sin
gles, 6-3,3-6,6-2.
No. 16 Lastra easily handled
No. 69 Jacobs, 7-5, 6-0, and No.
9 Barnikow similarly dis
patched No. 79 Christina Fu
sano, 6-3, 6 -1.
