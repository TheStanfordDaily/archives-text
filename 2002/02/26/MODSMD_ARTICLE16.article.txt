WOMEN'S TENNIS
Saturday: No. 3 Sfanford
defeats No. 14 California, 7-0

Stanford (8-1, 1-0) lost a
match and the top spot in the
polls to then-N0.5 Georgia at
the learn Indoors two weeks
ago in Madison, Wis., and has
been working hard since then to
prove that it is still the best team
in the country.
The recovery of senior Lau
ren Kalvaria from an injury has
helped spark the team's current
three-match winning streak.
Although the team was not
surprised that it beat the Bears,
the Cardinal was nonetheless
excited by how decisively it de
feated a talented Bears squad.
"They're a great team, and
they're always psyched up for
Stanford," Barnikow said. "It's a
huge victory."

On an afternoon that saw a
two-hour rain delay interrupt
play, Stanford got out to an early
1-0 lead by taking the first two
doubles matches.
Kalvaria and senior Gabriela
Lastra, the nation's No. 2 dou
bles team, knocked off Raquel
Kops-Jones and Jody Scheldt, 8-
3. The No. 8 duo of Barnikow
and freshman Erin Burdette
put away Carla Arguelles and
Nicole Havlicek, 8-4.
In third-flight doubles,
Christina Fusano and Jieun Ja
cobs edged Stanford's duo of
senior Keiko Tokuda and
freshman Story Tweedie-
Yates, 9-8 (9).
The Cardinal carried the
positive momentum into singles
play, taking all six matches.
"We obviously get psyched
up to play Cal," sophomore
Emilia Anderson said. "There
was some extra motivation."
Kalvaria, ranked No. 11 na
tionally in singles, outlasted No.
40 Kops-Jones in first-flight sin
gles, 6-3,3-6,6-2.
No. 16 Lastra easily handled
No. 69 Jacobs, 7-5, 6-0, and No.
9 Barnikow similarly dis
patched No. 79 Christina Fu
sano, 6-3, 6 -1.

Freshman Erin Burdette won her singles and doubles matches this week
end to lead No. 3 Stanford to a 7-0 victory over No. 14 California.
No. 15 Burdette edged No. 59
Catherine Lynch, 7-5, 7-6 (3), and
No. 103 Tokuda had no trouble
with Scheldt, 6-1,6-1.
Anderson finished off the
rout with a 7-6, 3-6, 6-1 win
over Havlicek.
The Cardinal returned home
after the match having made an
important statement about its
toughness and desire to repeat
as NCAA champions this year. A
7-0 win on the road against the
No. 14 team : >n the country tends
to do that.
"It was definitely nice to beat
them on their home courts," An
derson said.
Cal is by far the toughest of
the three teams — No. 54 UNLV

and Hawaii are the others —
that Stanford has faced since
Georgia handed the Cardinal's
undermanned squad its first loss
in two years.
"The matches were all tough,"
Barnikow said. "Wejust wanted to
get the job done [against Cal]."
The win over Cal was Stan
ford's conference opener for 2002.
"This is a good start to the Pac
-10 season for sure," Barnikow said.
Stanford hosts No. 59 Ore
gon (6-3) on Friday and No. 42
San Diego State (4-2) on Satur
day, and it will look to continue
its winning ways. Although its
opponents aren't quite as
tough as Cal, the Cardinal is
unlikely to let up.
"You can't take any team for
granted," Anderson said. "We're
going to go out there and play
tough and hopefully dominate like
we did this weekend." „
