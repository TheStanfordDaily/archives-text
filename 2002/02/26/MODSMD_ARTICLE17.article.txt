### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford softball
team tarnished its perfect record
this weekend in the NFCA Leadoff
Classic in Georgia, where it went 4-
2 overall.

SOFTBALL
Friday: No. 3 Stanford 6, No.
14 Cal State-Fullerton 1; No. 3
Stanford 4, Missouri 1
Saturday: No. 25 Massachu
setts 3, No. 3 Stanford 1; No. 9
Nebraska 2, No. 3 Stanford 0
Sunday: No. 3 Stanford 1,
No. 14 Cal State-Fullerton 0;
No. 3 Stanford 1, No. 13 Fresno
State 0 (8 inn.)

The Cardinal ended up taking
third in the Gold Bracket of the
tournament after winning an
extra-inning pitcher's duel
against No. 13 Fresno State (10-
5), but not before suffering two
losses.
Stanford (11-2) kicked off the
tournament much like it had the
previous weekend, beating No. 14
Cal State-Fullerton in the opener.
The Cardinal, which had barely
squeaked by the Titans (9-7) a
week earlier, walked away with a
resounding 6-1 victory.
The Stanford lineup cracked
open the game in the first inning
when senior center fielder Jessica
Mendoza rocketed a two-run
home run on the first pitch of her
at-bat.
The Cardinal struck again in
the top of the fifth as senior first
baseman Sarah Beeson singled up
the middle to plate senior short

stop Robin Walker fora 3-0 lead.
Two hitters later, sophomore
catcher Jessica Allister singled to
left Held to drive in Beeson.
Stanford tacked on its last
two runs on an RBI single by ju
nior second baseman Kira
Ching and a hit batsman with
the bases loaded in the top of
the seventh inning.
T he only Titan run came on a
solo home run in the seventh inning.
Stanford junior Tori Nyberg
pitched a complete game and
earned her sixth win in the effort.
The Cardinal then went on to
win the next game over Missouri,
4-1, behind the pitching of junior
Maureen LeCocq, who allowed
just four hits.
The Tigers (6-9) scored first by
homering in the second inning.
Stanford did not answer until
the fourth, when LeCocq walked
with the bases loaded to lie the
game. The game remained tied
until an inning later when t he Car
dinal scored three runs on a single
and a fielder's choice.
The Cardinal took the field
again the next day against No. 25
Massachusetts and No. 9 Nebras
ka. Stanford dropped both games,
3-1 and then 2-0.
The Cardinal offense was un
able to produce any runs against
the Minutewomen after the first
inning. Mendoza's double to left
field drove in Walker for the Car
dinal's only run of the game.
The Minutewomen an
swered back immediately with a
run of their own in the top of
the second when catcher Jamie
Cahalan homered for the tying
run. Both sides stayed silent
until the top of the seventh
when Massachusetts scored two

runs and won, 3-1.
Following its first defeat, the
Cardinal took on Nebraska. The
Lady Huskers were led by the
eventual tournament MVP, pitch
er Peaches James.
Nyberg, who also earned All-
Tournament Team honors, went
head-to-head with James in the
circle. Nyberg allowed just four
hits to the Huskers, but one of
these was a fateful two-run home
run that ended up being enough
for the win.
The Cardinal, of course, is not
used to losing, and il came back
with a vengence.
The next day Stanford got two
big wins against two big teams.

Stanford finished out the Clas
sic with its third victory over
Fullerton and a win over Fresno
State.
Both games were close 1-0 wins
and displayed the strong pitching
talents of the Cardinal stall .
Overall, (lie players were not
satisfied with their performances
this weekend, but do see them as a
learning tool.
"The weekend was very disap
pointing," Ching said. "Thetwoloss
es served its a wakenp call. It showed
us that We can't just coast through
and expect to win. Every team comes
out wanting to beat us, and we have
to come prepared to play every
game with our best foot forward."

The Cardinal ended up taking
third in the Gold Bracket of the
tournament after winning an
extra-inning pitcher's duel
against No. 13 Fresno State (10-
5), but not before suffering two
losses.
Stanford (11-2) kicked off the
tournament much like it had the
previous weekend, beating No. 14
Cal State-Fullerton in the opener.
The Cardinal, which had barely
squeaked by the Titans (9-7) a
week earlier, walked away with a
resounding 6-1 victory.
The Stanford lineup cracked
open the game in the first inning
when senior center fielder Jessica
Mendoza rocketed a two-run
home run on the first pitch of her
at-bat.
The Cardinal struck again in
the top of the fifth as senior first
baseman Sarah Beeson singled up
the middle to plate senior short

stop Robin Walker fora 3-0 lead.
Two hitters later, sophomore
catcher Jessica Allister singled to
left Held to drive in Beeson.
Stanford tacked on its last
two runs on an RBI single by ju
nior second baseman Kira
Ching and a hit batsman with
the bases loaded in the top of
the seventh inning.
T he only Titan run came on a
solo home run in the seventh inning.
Stanford junior Tori Nyberg
pitched a complete game and
earned her sixth win in the effort.
The Cardinal then went on to
win the next game over Missouri,
4-1, behind the pitching of junior
Maureen LeCocq, who allowed
just four hits.
The Tigers (6-9) scored first by
homering in the second inning.
Stanford did not answer until
the fourth, when LeCocq walked
with the bases loaded to lie the
game. The game remained tied
until an inning later when t he Car
dinal scored three runs on a single
and a fielder's choice.
The Cardinal took the field
again the next day against No. 25
Massachusetts and No. 9 Nebras
ka. Stanford dropped both games,
3-1 and then 2-0.
The Cardinal offense was un
able to produce any runs against
the Minutewomen after the first
inning. Mendoza's double to left
field drove in Walker for the Car
dinal's only run of the game.
The Minutewomen an
swered back immediately with a
run of their own in the top of
the second when catcher Jamie
Cahalan homered for the tying
run. Both sides stayed silent
until the top of the seventh
when Massachusetts scored two

runs and won, 3-1.
Following its first defeat, the
Cardinal took on Nebraska. The
Lady Huskers were led by the
eventual tournament MVP, pitch
er Peaches James.
Nyberg, who also earned All-
Tournament Team honors, went
head-to-head with James in the
circle. Nyberg allowed just four
hits to the Huskers, but one of
these was a fateful two-run home
run that ended up being enough
for the win.
The Cardinal, of course, is not
used to losing, and il came back
