# 'Skategate' only a part of Olympic fun
## 
### 
The "Skategate"
scandals at the 2002
Olympic Winter
Games will long be
remembered as tarnishing
moments in an otherwise al
most flawlessly run Olympics.
But I, for one, am glad that a
couple people finally worked
up the nerve to stand up for

their rights and declare that they were not
about to allow a few renegade judges strip them
of their just rewards.
If there is one thing that still rings true about
athletic competitions in which the outcomes are
determined by judges, it is the fact that it is com
pletely unacceptable to allow subjective deci
sions to play a role. Some may make the argu
ment that the judges are human and therefore
subject to human biases, but I say that idea is lu
dicrous. Olympic judges should be held to su
perhuman standards, and their ballots should,

and must, reflect the popular whim of the
crowd in attendance. It's the only fair way to de
cide such outcomes.
And the governing body of figure skating was
correct to assume powers it was never intended to
have in order to award a dual gold medal. Such an
act should not have adverse or controversial ef
fects in future decision making, and it sets a very
desirable precedent in which the television-watch
ing public, along with Boh Costas, should decide
which team receives the gold medal.
The Canadians had every right to whine
and moan about having to settle fora lousy
silver medal. Everyone knows that any
Olympic judge is immune to international
pressures. The Canadians had a national
duty to whimper,and gripe about being the
second-best pair in the world. The
Olympics aren't about representing your
country to the very best of your ability,
they're about winning gold medals, and
nothing else matters.

I he Russians were also right to take it upon
themselves to outdo the Canadians in the com
plaint department. Nothing is more detrimen
tal to the Russian Olympic delegation than to
have to share the figure skating gold medal
with a bunch of whining Canadians. Clearly
the international figure skating community
had post-Cold War bitterness on its mind when
it decided to royally screw Russia over by not
doing anything.
And having NHL officials in charge of the
U.S.-Russia hockey game was as blatant a na
tionalist move against the Russians as has ever
been attempted in international athletic com
petition. Surely the decision to have the best
referees from the best hockey organization on
the planet was a conspiracy 011 the part of the
United States and Canada to shame the Russ
ian team and disgrace Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin and his entire cabinet. Any


Ryan Stewart
Olympic historian can tell you that
no Russian team has ever benefit
ed from suspect officiating in
Olympic competition — except
for that that basketball game in
1972, and that doesn't count be
cause it was the Summer
Olympics.
While these were the most pub
licized of the judging scandals in
Salt Lake City, other more private
issues also warrant serious com
plaints. For instance, it is a well
known fact that U.S. figure skater
Michelle Kwan edged out fellow
American Sasha Cohen for the
bronze model based solely on the
tact that Japanese judge thinks
Kwan has a much nicer ass.
Canadian figure ski iter Flvis Sto
jko was supposedly voted out of
meckil contention because neither the
Italian nor Swiss judges like the song
"Blue Suede Shoes." It would be
hoove both athletes to come forward

with formal complainLs. Hie very dig
nity of the spoil depends <>nit.
Athletes everywhere should
take a lesson from "Skategate."
When things don't go your way,
just complain really loudly and
someone will appease you just to
shut you up. 1 can't wait to see
what great consequences these
decisions will have on the 2006
Games in Turin, Italy. Maybe
judge Judy will be hired to medi
ate disputes rinkside, so as to
avoid the lengthy delays in ap
peals and formal complaints.
Whatever changes are made to
the judging process in subjective
sports, there is one institutional
emblem that needs immediate re
vision to avoid ambiguity in the
future. The Olympic motto
should be changed to "Faster,
Higher, Stronger — subject to
committee review."

Ryan Stewart is a junior vui joring in eco
nomics, ami he would like to issue a for

have in order to award a dual gold medal. Such an
act should not have adverse or controversial ef
fects in future decision making, and it sets a very
desirable precedent in which the television-watch
ing public, along with Boh Costas, should decide
which team receives the gold medal.
The Canadians had every right to whine
and moan about having to settle fora lousy
silver medal. Everyone knows that any
Olympic judge is immune to international
pressures. The Canadians had a national
duty to whimper,and gripe about being the
second-best pair in the world. The
Olympics aren't about representing your
country to the very best of your ability,
they're about winning gold medals, and
nothing else matters.

I he Russians were also right to take it upon
themselves to outdo the Canadians in the com
plaint department. Nothing is more detrimen
tal to the Russian Olympic delegation than to
have to share the figure skating gold medal
with a bunch of whining Canadians. Clearly
the international figure skating community
had post-Cold War bitterness on its mind when
it decided to royally screw Russia over by not
doing anything.
And having NHL officials in charge of the
U.S.-Russia hockey game was as blatant a na
tionalist move against the Russians as has ever
been attempted in international athletic com
petition. Surely the decision to have the best
referees from the best hockey organization on
the planet was a conspiracy 011 the part of the
United States and Canada to shame the Russ
ian team and disgrace Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin and his entire cabinet. Any

Olympic historian can tell you that
no Russian team has ever benefit
ed from suspect officiating in
Olympic competition — except
for that that basketball game in
1972, and that doesn't count be
cause it was the Summer
Olympics.
While these were the most pub
licized of the judging scandals in
Salt Lake City, other more private
issues also warrant serious com
plaints. For instance, it is a well
known fact that U.S. figure skater
Michelle Kwan edged out fellow
American Sasha Cohen for the
bronze model based solely on the
tact that Japanese judge thinks
Kwan has a much nicer ass.
Canadian figure ski iter Flvis Sto
jko was supposedly voted out of
meckil contention because neither the
Italian nor Swiss judges like the song
"Blue Suede Shoes." It would be
hoove both athletes to come forward

with formal complainLs. Hie very dig
nity of the spoil depends <>nit.
Athletes everywhere should
take a lesson from "Skategate."
When things don't go your way,
just complain really loudly and
someone will appease you just to
shut you up. 1 can't wait to see
what great consequences these
decisions will have on the 2006
Games in Turin, Italy. Maybe
judge Judy will be hired to medi
ate disputes rinkside, so as to
avoid the lengthy delays in ap
peals and formal complaints.
Whatever changes are made to
the judging process in subjective
sports, there is one institutional
emblem that needs immediate re
vision to avoid ambiguity in the
future. The Olympic motto
should be changed to "Faster,
Higher, Stronger — subject to
committee review."
