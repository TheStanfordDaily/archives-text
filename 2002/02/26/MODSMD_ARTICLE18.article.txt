# 'Skategate' only a part of Olympic fun

The "Skategate"
scandals at the 2002
Olympic Winter
Games will long be
remembered as tarnishing
moments in an otherwise al
most flawlessly run Olympics.
But I, for one, am glad that a
couple people finally worked
up the nerve to stand up for

their rights and declare that they were not
about to allow a few renegade judges strip them
of their just rewards.
If there is one thing that still rings true about
athletic competitions in which the outcomes are
determined by judges, it is the fact that it is com
pletely unacceptable to allow subjective deci
sions to play a role. Some may make the argu
ment that the judges are human and therefore
subject to human biases, but I say that idea is lu
dicrous. Olympic judges should be held to su
perhuman standards, and their ballots should,

and must, reflect the popular whim of the
crowd in attendance. It's the only fair way to de
cide such outcomes.
And the governing body of figure skating was
correct to assume powers it was never intended to
have in order to award a dual gold medal. Such an
act should not have adverse or controversial ef
fects in future decision making, and it sets a very
desirable precedent in which the television-watch
ing public, along with Boh Costas, should decide
which team receives the gold medal.
The Canadians had every right to whine
and moan about having to settle fora lousy
silver medal. Everyone knows that any
Olympic judge is immune to international
pressures. The Canadians had a national
duty to whimper,and gripe about being the
second-best pair in the world. The
Olympics aren't about representing your
country to the very best of your ability,
they're about winning gold medals, and
nothing else matters.

I he Russians were also right to take it upon
themselves to outdo the Canadians in the com
plaint department. Nothing is more detrimen
tal to the Russian Olympic delegation than to
have to share the figure skating gold medal
with a bunch of whining Canadians. Clearly
the international figure skating community
had post-Cold War bitterness on its mind when
it decided to royally screw Russia over by not
doing anything.
And having NHL officials in charge of the
U.S.-Russia hockey game was as blatant a na
tionalist move against the Russians as has ever
been attempted in international athletic com
petition. Surely the decision to have the best
referees from the best hockey organization on
the planet was a conspiracy 011 the part of the
United States and Canada to shame the Russ
ian team and disgrace Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin and his entire cabinet. Any
