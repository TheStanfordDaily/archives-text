TRACK AND FIELD
Friday-Saturday: Men's
track finishes fifth ana women's
track finishes sixth at the MPSF
Championships in Flagstaff,
Ariz.

I he Cardinal men took fifth
overall after the two days of compe
tition and the women placed sixth.
Stanford received points for
strong performances in all
events, hut the absence of the ac
complished distance-running
squad made it difficult for the
Cardinal to achieve a high place
on the podium.
The higher altitude of
Flagstaff always makes NCAA
qualifying times difficult to attain
for distance runners, and because

of that, the Cardinal did not send
a large contingent.
Those that did compete, howev
er, recorded outstanding rimes that
gave valuable points to the Cardi
nal's team effort.

third in the 3,000 meters on Friday,
