# Volleyball takes split

### KATRINA LAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After defeating top-ranked
UCLA, it was confirmed that Stan
ford could beat the best.
But the question remained:
Could Stanford consistently beat
the best?

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Friday: No. 7 Stanford loses to
No. 1 Pepperdine, 3-2
Sunday: No. 7 Stanford
defeats USC, 3-0

Judging by the high level of
play exhibited this weekend, the
answer was a resounding yes. The
No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball
team (9-7, 8-5 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) faced back-to
back top-ranked teams, including
newly crowned No. 1 Pepperdine
(13-4, 9-2), this weekend.
In front of a Parents' Weekend
crowd, the new-and-improved
Cardinal ultimately lost (25-30,30-
24, 34-32, 23-30, 15-13), but not
without an impressive live-game,
two-hour showdown.
In the same style of play that
upset the Bruins two weeks ago,
Stanford won the first game con
vincingly, 30-25, under a hitting
clip of .714 and five kills from ju
nior middle blocker Paul Bocage.
The Cardinal offense also sup
pressed the Waves to a match-low
. 179 in the opening game.
Though Stanford lost the next
two games, a fourth game victory,
in which junior opposite Curt

Toppel posted 11 kills, rejuvenat
ed the Stanford squad and forced a
fifth game.
The Waves took advantage of
Cardinal hitting errors and
brought a 10-10 tie to a 15-13 Pep
perdine "Victory. Despite the loss,
nearly every member of the Stan
ford team had season-best or near
season-best performances.
The MPSF Player of the Week,
redshirt freshman setter Kevin
Hansen, posted a season-high 76
kills and 12 digs. Toppel's 31 kills
and junior libero Seth Ring's 14
digs also helped propel the Stan
ford team.
Rebounding from the grueling
loss against Pepperdine, the Cardi
nal turned to another conference
rival, Southern California (5-13, 2-
10), to finish a four-game homes
tand on Sunday.
The Trojans were no match for
the well-tuned Cardinal. USC post
ed a .224 clip to Stanford's .340.
During the quick match, the
Cardinal successfully showed
depth in every position and
showed offensive prowess while
successfully suppressing Trojan
points in the conference victory.
"Any conference match is a
big match. Every team is really
competitive," head coach Don
Shaw said.
Ten of the nation's top-15
teams are in the MPSF, and a max
imum of two will be eligible for
NCAA Championship bids.
Despite splitting on the week
end, Stanford was finally able to
find what it had been looking for
all season: consistency.
