# Stanford community honors Pearl
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
A crowd of close to 400 people gathered in
Memorial Church yesterday afternoon to lis
ten to tributes, prayers and music in remem
brance of the life of Wall Street Journal re
porter Daniel Pearl, who received a bachelor's
in communications from Stanford in 1985.
Pearl was researching a story for The
Journal in Karachi, Pakistan when a group
of extremists kidnapped him. The State De
partment confirmed his death Thursday.
"He was abducted and murdered be
cause he was an American, a journalist and a
Jew," said Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann,
associate dean for religious life.
1 lie memorial focused on Pearl as a per
son and the way he touched the lives of the
those with whom he came into contact.
Several speakers, including his former
professors and classmates, spoke fondly of
Pearl's influence on their lives.
"The horror of Danny's death can easily
overshadow the grandeur of his life," Kar
lin-Neumann said. "He conveyed his love to
his family and friends through his humanity
and zest for life."
University President John Hennessy,
who attended, was like most of the audience
in that he did not know Pearl personally.
Hennessy came to the event "to honor

[Pearl]," he said.
"Danny was extraordinary," Hennessy
said. "A decent man who was loved by all
those who knew him. I fe was part of the spe
cial extended family, embodying the spirit
of the Stanford family with a passion for

truth and understanding."
To commemorate Pearl's life, the Commu
nication Department at Stanford will begin an
endowment for undergraduates in Pearl's

name.
"1 came this afternoon because
I felt it was important to support
the work of journalists who are
abroad right now, especially a
Stanford graduate who has
brought so much honor to this in
stitution," sophomore Katy
Quarles said. "Even though I did
not know him, I truly sympathize
with his wife and unborn child.
It's not fair that this has hap
pened to them."
Many of the tributes focused
on the role of the journalist in
general and how Pearl's commit
ment to his field reflected his
dedication to understanding
people's differences.
Pearl "did what he wanted to
do, what he loved," said Craig
Sherman, a member of the class of
1985.
"Reporters suppress the urge
to let anger affect their work,"
said Knight Fellow James Alred
dy. "[His captors] did not recog
nize Danny as their ally. Cood re

porters everywhere wake up pur
suing truth.
"What disgusts me is those who
killed Danny Pearl cut out their
own tongues," Alreddy said. "He
was their best opportunity to be
come understood. Regardless of
his personal sentiments, he could
have shown their humanity."
Ty Kim, class of 1986, knew
Pearl and reflected on his friend's
passing.
"Many will miss him," Kim said.
"World news is reserved for the
very best [reporters], and that is ex
actly what Danny is, the very best."
Between choked sobs, his
friend Karen Edwards, class of
1985, remembered Pearl's fond
ness for Kurt Vonnegut and reg
gae music.
"1 truly would like to believe
that in the countless hours he was
held captive, he achieved a state
of grace," Edwards said.
His former professors also
contributed their memories of
Pearl's presence on campus.
"Danny was a standout — very
smart, his wit was quick, but he
wasn't cynical or ironic," Com
munications Prof. Henry Bre
itrose said. "Journalism is a pro

fession that serves others; they
follow a story to help us know
things others would have wanted
to conceal. They don't work for
their publishers; they work for
us, the people."
Marion Lewenstein, professor
emeritus of communications,
echoed these sentiments.
"Danny was quiet, gentle and
earnest," Lewenstein said. "He
turned in beautifully researched
papers that reflected an unex
pected perspective because he
had such depth and liked to ex
plore the material.
"Everyone in our department is
bereft, whether we knew him or
not. May we continue in his
image."
"Danny's friendship will al
ways inspire me," Edwards said.
"I think of his family and it makes
me want to be a better mother. I
think of his life and it makes me
want to be a better person. 1 think
of his death and it makes me want
peace."
"I don't expect my fellow jour
nalists to take revenge," Alreddy
said. "They will be too busy
searching the elusive question —
'why?'"

ment to his field reflected his
dedication to understanding
people's differences.
Pearl "did what he wanted to
do, what he loved," said Craig
Sherman, a member of the class of
1985.
"Reporters suppress the urge
to let anger affect their work,"
said Knight Fellow James Alred
dy. "[His captors] did not recog
nize Danny as their ally. Cood re

porters everywhere wake up pur
suing truth.
"What disgusts me is those who
killed Danny Pearl cut out their
own tongues," Alreddy said. "He
was their best opportunity to be
come understood. Regardless of
his personal sentiments, he could
have shown their humanity."
Ty Kim, class of 1986, knew
Pearl and reflected on his friend's
passing.
"Many will miss him," Kim said.
"World news is reserved for the
very best [reporters], and that is ex
actly what Danny is, the very best."
Between choked sobs, his
friend Karen Edwards, class of
1985, remembered Pearl's fond
ness for Kurt Vonnegut and reg
gae music.
"1 truly would like to believe
that in the countless hours he was
held captive, he achieved a state
of grace," Edwards said.
His former professors also
contributed their memories of
Pearl's presence on campus.
"Danny was a standout — very
smart, his wit was quick, but he
wasn't cynical or ironic," Com
munications Prof. Henry Bre
itrose said. "Journalism is a pro

fession that serves others; they
follow a story to help us know
things others would have wanted
to conceal. They don't work for
their publishers; they work for
us, the people."
Marion Lewenstein, professor
emeritus of communications,
echoed these sentiments.
"Danny was quiet, gentle and
earnest," Lewenstein said. "He
turned in beautifully researched
papers that reflected an unex
pected perspective because he
had such depth and liked to ex
plore the material.
"Everyone in our department is
bereft, whether we knew him or
not. May we continue in his
image."
"Danny's friendship will al
ways inspire me," Edwards said.
"I think of his family and it makes
me want to be a better mother. I
think of his life and it makes me
want to be a better person. 1 think
of his death and it makes me want
peace."
"I don't expect my fellow jour
nalists to take revenge," Alreddy
said. "They will be too busy
searching the elusive question —
'why?'"
A crowd of close to 400 people gathered in
Memorial Church yesterday afternoon to lis
ten to tributes, prayers and music in remem
brance of the life of Wall Street Journal re
porter Daniel Pearl, who received a bachelor's
in communications from Stanford in 1985.
Pearl was researching a story for The
Journal in Karachi, Pakistan when a group
of extremists kidnapped him. The State De
partment confirmed his death Thursday.
"He was abducted and murdered be
cause he was an American, a journalist and a
Jew," said Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann,
associate dean for religious life.
1 lie memorial focused on Pearl as a per
son and the way he touched the lives of the
those with whom he came into contact.
Several speakers, including his former
professors and classmates, spoke fondly of
Pearl's influence on their lives.
"The horror of Danny's death can easily
overshadow the grandeur of his life," Kar
lin-Neumann said. "He conveyed his love to
his family and friends through his humanity
and zest for life."
University President John Hennessy,
who attended, was like most of the audience
in that he did not know Pearl personally.
Hennessy came to the event "to honor

[Pearl]," he said.
"Danny was extraordinary," Hennessy
said. "A decent man who was loved by all
those who knew him. I fe was part of the spe
cial extended family, embodying the spirit
of the Stanford family with a passion for

truth and understanding."
To commemorate Pearl's life, the Commu
nication Department at Stanford will begin an
endowment for undergraduates in Pearl's

"1 came this afternoon because
I felt it was important to support
the work of journalists who are
abroad right now, especially a
Stanford graduate who has
brought so much honor to this in
stitution," sophomore Katy
Quarles said. "Even though I did
not know him, I truly sympathize
with his wife and unborn child.
It's not fair that this has hap
pened to them."
Many of the tributes focused
on the role of the journalist in
