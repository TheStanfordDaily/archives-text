A crowd of close to 400 people gathered in
Memorial Church yesterday afternoon to lis
ten to tributes, prayers and music in remem
brance of the life of Wall Street Journal re
porter Daniel Pearl, who received a bachelor's
in communications from Stanford in 1985.
Pearl was researching a story for The
Journal in Karachi, Pakistan when a group
of extremists kidnapped him. The State De
partment confirmed his death Thursday.
"He was abducted and murdered be
cause he was an American, a journalist and a
Jew," said Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann,
associate dean for religious life.
1 lie memorial focused on Pearl as a per
son and the way he touched the lives of the
those with whom he came into contact.
Several speakers, including his former
professors and classmates, spoke fondly of
Pearl's influence on their lives.
"The horror of Danny's death can easily
overshadow the grandeur of his life," Kar
lin-Neumann said. "He conveyed his love to
his family and friends through his humanity
and zest for life."
University President John Hennessy,
who attended, was like most of the audience
in that he did not know Pearl personally.
Hennessy came to the event "to honor

[Pearl]," he said.
"Danny was extraordinary," Hennessy
said. "A decent man who was loved by all
those who knew him. I fe was part of the spe
cial extended family, embodying the spirit
of the Stanford family with a passion for

truth and understanding."
To commemorate Pearl's life, the Commu
nication Department at Stanford will begin an
endowment for undergraduates in Pearl's
