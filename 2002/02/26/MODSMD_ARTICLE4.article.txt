### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Literary theorist and cultural his
torian Elaine Scarry, a professor of
aesthetics and general theory of
value at Harvard, gave a lecture to
students and faculty last night tided,
"Nine, One, One: Citizenship in
Emergency." Scarry spoke as part
of the Presidential Lectures series
presented by the Stanford Human
ities Center.
University President John Hen
nessy and former President Ger
hard Casper were in attendance at
the lecture, as well as Provost John
Etchemendy.
The lecture examined the series
of events surrounding Sept. 11.
Scarry used the events to critically
examine the structure of the United
States military.
"Defending this country is an
obligation we all share," Scarry
said. "The Second Amendment re
quires distribution of the 'injuring
power' to the whole population.
The authority of arms needs to he
distributed."
Scarry argued that — with

President George YV. Hush possess
ing extensive war powers — deci
sions regarding war "don't allow
room for citizenry."
With the advent of nuclear war
and weapons of mass destruction,
Scarry warned that the country
needs to be wary of giving increased
powers to the military. With this in
crease in presidential authority, citi
zens have less of an opportunity to
express their consent for the coun
try to go to war.
Scarry said that Sept. 11 pro
vided an example of how the mili
tary still needs citizen involve
ment. According to her, the mili
tary di> 1 nothing to stop the hijack
ers on United Airlines flight 93,
which crashed in Pennsylvania,
hut the actions of citizens on the
flight prevented more tragedy.
Even if the military did have time
to prepare an air attack on the hi
jacked planes, Scarry questioned
whether or not the military had the
right to shoot down a commercial
airliner. Scarry argued that only cit
izens in the plane could make the
decision to kill themselves tor the com
mon good.
"They formed a small legislative
assembly," Scarry said. "And in 40
minutes . . . used their own censory
powers to make that decision, an ad
vantage over external military
forces."
Scarry went on to discuss how, in
many ways, the military is "stepping
out and becoming external" from citi
zen input. She described what she sees
as the damaging effects this phenome
non could have, especially with regard
to pol icies concerning wea p< >n s of mass
destruction.
"1 thought her talk was very
provocative," Emily Burrill, a graduate
student in history, said. "I like tier
work. 1 think she has a contemporary,
fresh outlook."
Shachar Link, a fellow graduate stu
dent in history, agreed.
"I thought it was good ... it was a
pretty imaginative twist and an in
tense critique of our military in rela
tion to [its] citizens," Link said. "While
most people are taking the view that
our military needs to be stronger, she
took the opposite view."
In her introduction of Scarry, So
cial and Political Philosophy Prof.
Deborah Sat/ said that Scarry em
braces a number of themes in her
work.
"She emphasizes the importance of
cc>nsent," Satz said. "CConsent is t he cen
tral idea of democratic legitimacy
We, unfortunately, take consent tor
granted."
