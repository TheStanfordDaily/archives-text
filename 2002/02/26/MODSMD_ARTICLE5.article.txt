# New seminars seek to boost overseas program
## 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Overseas Studies Pro
gram will begin offering "Over
seas Seminars" this September, a
new opportunity for students to
expand their learning experi
ences beyond U.S. borders.
These three-week-long semi
nars are taught by Stanford facul
ty in Belgium, China, Korea and
Russia, and can be taken for two
fall-quarter credit units.
Senior Brooke Hanson, a stu
dent advisor for the Stanford in
Berlin program, compares the
seminars to Sophomore College,
but said that the overseas semi
nars are more expansive.
"[The Seminars] are planned
on the Sophomore College
schedule to give students the op
portunity to travel with a profes
sor abroad fora few weeks before
school starts," Hanson said. "We
hope that the program will give

even more students the opportu
nity to go abroad and to explore
in places where Stanford does not
currently have overseas pro
grams, such as Beijing and
Korea."
A $500 fee covers tuition, lodg
ing, most meals and required
travel at each location. The fee
does not cover airfare, but finan
cial aid is available for students in
need.
Jacqueline Wender, executive
director of the program, said that
prior to the introduction of the
seminars, the program did not
allow all students who wanted to
study overseas to do so.
"We recognize that students
often are not able to take advan
tage of offerings during the regu
lar academic year, and we
thought it would be a wonderful
opportunity to offer this new set
of innovations," Wender said.
The new seminars also oiler a
range of international topics to
study.
I he seminars focus on ideas
relevant to each locale and in
clude such issues as "Local Elec
tions in China," "Repression, Re
form and Revolution: Russian
Music, Culture and Politics from
1855 to 1917" and "Political

Economy of the European
Union."
Junior Richard Kim, who is
applying for the Seoul seminar,
"Korea in a Globalizing World,"
said he expects the seminar to
supplement his field of study,
,Asian-American Studies.
"I would probably have a bel
ter understanding of contempo
rary Korean history and society
by being able to actually study in
Korea and learn from current
business and government lead
ers," Kim said. "Just the mere act

of having to adopt to a different
lifestyle is a learning experience
on its own."
With the start of the new acad
emic year coming just after the
overseas seminars, students can
either return to Stanford after
their overseas experience or go
on to an overseas studies pro
gram course.
Applications can be down
loaded from the overseas studies
program Web site —
http://osp.stanford.edu — and
must be submitted by March 5.
