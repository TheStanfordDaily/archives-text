If you think your days of acad
emia have to end after your un
dergraduate years, think again.
Stanford Continuing Studies is
offering a variety of courses open
to all Bay Area residents during
spring quarter.
T he Spring 2002 course cata
log for Continuing Studies in
cludes new courses, seminars
and workshops. The new addi
tions span a wide spectrum of
both techie and fuzzy depart
ments. Course titles include
"Popular Culture, Politics and
American Literature," "North
west Coast Indian Art" and
"Modern Cosmology and Quan
tum Theory."

The Continuing Studies stu
dent body represents a highly ed
ucated and intellectual popula
tion nestled in Palo Alto and the
Stanford campus, said Assoc.
Dean of Stanford Continuing
Studies Terf-y Shtob.
"According to our last demo
graphic survey, 90 percent of
our students have an under
graduate degree, and 60 percent
have graduate degrees," said
Shtob.
"Professional vocations of
the students range a huge
amount," she said. "We have
doctors, lawyers, people from
the high- tech world, as well as
Stanford staff and community
members."
According to Shtob, limited
enrollment classes are tradition
ally favorites and tend to fill up
first. These courses include cre
ative writing, art studio, foreign
languages and personal devel
opment classes. Drama, busi
ness, science and religious stud-

ies are other popular areas with
in Continuing Studies.
The "Crossroads" series,
taught by Lecturer Ed Steidle,
has been a mainstay of the Con
tinuing Studies program fora
number of years.
"['Crossroads'] takes an in
terdisciplinary approach by
using art, literature and history
to explore major world cultures
in different historic periods,"
Shtob said.

Susskind will be teaching a new
Continuing Education course on
cosmology and quantum theory
next quarter.
'The course will focus on re
cent ideas about the smallest and
largest things in the universe,"
Susskind said. " I he main theme
will be what modern theories like
the string theory have to say
about elementary particles, black
holes and the universe itself."
