### ELLIE RITCH STAFF WRITER 
If you think your days of acad
emia have to end after your un
dergraduate years, think again.
Stanford Continuing Studies is
offering a variety of courses open
to all Bay Area residents during
spring quarter.
T he Spring 2002 course cata
log for Continuing Studies in
cludes new courses, seminars
and workshops. The new addi
tions span a wide spectrum of
both techie and fuzzy depart
ments. Course titles include
"Popular Culture, Politics and
American Literature," "North
west Coast Indian Art" and
"Modern Cosmology and Quan
tum Theory."

The Continuing Studies stu
dent body represents a highly ed
ucated and intellectual popula
tion nestled in Palo Alto and the
Stanford campus, said Assoc.
Dean of Stanford Continuing
Studies Terf-y Shtob.
"According to our last demo
graphic survey, 90 percent of
our students have an under
graduate degree, and 60 percent
have graduate degrees," said
Shtob.
"Professional vocations of
the students range a huge
amount," she said. "We have
doctors, lawyers, people from
the high- tech world, as well as
Stanford staff and community
members."
According to Shtob, limited
enrollment classes are tradition
ally favorites and tend to fill up
first. These courses include cre
ative writing, art studio, foreign
languages and personal devel
opment classes. Drama, busi
ness, science and religious stud-

ies are other popular areas with
in Continuing Studies.
The "Crossroads" series,
taught by Lecturer Ed Steidle,
has been a mainstay of the Con
tinuing Studies program fora
number of years.
"['Crossroads'] takes an in
terdisciplinary approach by
using art, literature and history
to explore major world cultures
in different historic periods,"
Shtob said.

Susskind will be teaching a new
Continuing Education course on
cosmology and quantum theory
next quarter.
'The course will focus on re
cent ideas about the smallest and
largest things in the universe,"
Susskind said. " I he main theme
will be what modern theories like
the string theory have to say
about elementary particles, black
holes and the universe itself."
Although Susskind is also
teaching Physics 25 to undergrad
uates this spring, he will also be
involved with Stanford's Continu
ing Studies program.
"1 like the idea of continuing
education and have thought
about doing it for some time,"
Susskind said.
In 1991, Continuing Studies
started the Stanford Master of
Liberal Arts program as its de
gree-granting component. The
program provides its students
with a broad range of curriculum
distribution requirements and
culminates with a master's thesis

by each student on a specific topic.
Although the master's pro
gram is relatively small. Continu
ing Studies enrolls quite a large
number of students each quarter.
"For the three regular academ
ic quarters we have about 2,600
students, and for the summer
quarter about 2,100," Shtob said.
Anyone with a high school
diploma is invited to enroll in
Continuing Studies, including
current Stanford students and
professors. All students pay per
course, and the registration fee is
$30. Course prices range from
112 ree special events and lectures to
three-unit and limited-enroll
ment courses costing $495.
To bring new life to the Con
tinuing Studies course bulletin,
Shtob searched Stanford li

braries' bookshelves lor illustra
tions that would be both eye
catching and stimulating lor the
academic community. With help
from John Mustain in the Special
Collections department of Creen
Library and University Archivist
Maggie Kimball, Shtob found a
number of American political
and social satiie caricatures to
highlight the catalog.
To pic k up a free course cata

cartoons by William 1 logarth and
Thomas Nast, visit the Continu
ing Studies Department, the Stan

cent ideas about the smallest and
largest things in the universe,"
Susskind said. " I he main theme
will be what modern theories like
the string theory have to say
about elementary particles, black
holes and the universe itself."
Although Susskind is also
teaching Physics 25 to undergrad
uates this spring, he will also be
involved with Stanford's Continu
ing Studies program.
"1 like the idea of continuing
education and have thought
about doing it for some time,"
Susskind said.
In 1991, Continuing Studies
started the Stanford Master of
Liberal Arts program as its de
gree-granting component. The
program provides its students
with a broad range of curriculum
distribution requirements and
culminates with a master's thesis

by each student on a specific topic.
Although the master's pro
gram is relatively small. Continu
ing Studies enrolls quite a large
number of students each quarter.
"For the three regular academ
ic quarters we have about 2,600
students, and for the summer
quarter about 2,100," Shtob said.
Anyone with a high school
diploma is invited to enroll in
Continuing Studies, including
current Stanford students and
professors. All students pay per
course, and the registration fee is
$30. Course prices range from
112 ree special events and lectures to
three-unit and limited-enroll
ment courses costing $495.
To bring new life to the Con
tinuing Studies course bulletin,
Shtob searched Stanford li

braries' bookshelves lor illustra
tions that would be both eye
catching and stimulating lor the
academic community. With help
from John Mustain in the Special
Collections department of Creen
Library and University Archivist
Maggie Kimball, Shtob found a
number of American political
and social satiie caricatures to
highlight the catalog.
To pic k up a free course cata
log that now includes historical
cartoons by William 1 logarth and
Thomas Nast, visit the Continu
ing Studies Department, the Stan
ford Bookstore or the Tresidder
Union ticket oflice.
