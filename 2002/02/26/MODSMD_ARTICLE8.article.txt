# Distinguished professors named to National Academy of Engineering
## 
### MIKEY LEE RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Four professors were elected last week
to the National Academy of Engineer
ing— one of (he highest professional
distinctions engineers can attain, accord
ing to the academy.
The new members are Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Ronald Hanson, Pe
troleum Engineering Prof. Rpland
Home and Electrical Engineering
Prof. Emeritus Martin Hellman. A
fourth, Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Norbert Peters, was named a new for
eign associate.
The number of academy members
from Stanford now totals 83, to go along
with two foreign associates.
Hanson, who chairs the Mechanical
Engineering department, does research
in the areas of laser diagnostics and sen
sors, chemical kinetics, shock waves and
combustion. He recently served as the
chairman of the Gordon Conference on

Combustion Diagnostics and chairman
of the Western States section of the Com
bustion Institute.
Hanson received his doctorate in
aeronautics and astronautics from Stan
ford in 1968.
The academy honored Hanson for
"the development and application of in
novative laser diagnostics and sensors in
(he fields of combustion, chemical kinet
ics and power conversion."
Hellman is best known as the co-in
ventor of public key cryptography in
1970. The invention allowed comput
ers to communicate with each other
safely, preventing eavesdropping by
other computers. Hellman's research
also led to digital signatures that help
with legal verification of con tracts done
over computers.
Home is the Petroleum Engineering
department's fourth member elected to
the Academy. He was cited for "innova
tions in the department of techniques for
the testing and optimization of pet role

urn reservoirs."
The majority of his research focuses
on the matching of models to various
classes of reservoir responses.
Peters, of the Center for Turbulence
Research, was praised for "contribu
tions to the field of combustion model
ing of turbulent flames and the devel
opment of chemical kinetic mechanisms
for hydrocarbon oxidation." His re
search looks at understanding pollution
formation and reduction in spark igni
tion and engines.
He is also the founding director of a
technology institute in Germany.
Founded in 1964, the National Acad
emy of Engineering provides engineer
ing leadership in service to the nation.
The academy has more than 2,000
peer-elected members and foreign asso
ciates, most of whom are senior profes
sionals in business, acadcinia and gov
ernment. According to the NAE Web
site, members are among "the world's
most accomplished engineers."
