# Republicans now tied in gubernatorial primary

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former
Mayor Richard Riordan, the one
time front-mnner for the Republi
can nomination for governor, has
slipped into a dead heat with a con
servative businessman making his
lirst try for office, according to a poll
released yesterday, a week before
the primary.
The Los Angeles Times poll
found Riordan and Bill Simon tied
with 31 percent support among
people likely to vote in the March 5
primary. A Times poll last month
showed Riordan with 14-point lead
over Simon.
Secretary of State Bill Jones, also
running for the GOP gubernatorial
nomination, has 14 percent.
The dead heat, said pollster
Mark Baldassare of the Public Pol
icy Institute of California, shows
Republican voters may be
wrestling with their choices:
Simon, a conservative who may fit
their personal views, or Riordan, a
moderate who may have a better
chance to win in November.
"GOP voters are clearly strug
gling with this," he said.
Three developments make the
race close, said GOP consultant Dan
Schnur, a former campaign adviser
to Riordan.
The first was Democratic Gov.

Gray Davis' decision to spend more
than $8 million on television adver
tisements attacking Riordan, who
had led in all Republican polls until
this week.
"I don't know of a situation in
modern political history where an
opposition candidate has done so
much to influence the race in the op
posite party," Schnur said.
Second, Riordan made a strate
gic decision months ago to look past
the conservative Republicans who
vote in the GOP primary and appeal
to moderate voters who may choose
the state's next governor.
Third, Simon capitalized on that
opportunity by making a direct ap
peal to conservative GOP voters.
Simon has also linked himself to
popular former New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
Riordan, a 71-year-old million
aire businessman, supports abor
tion rights, gay rights, gun con
trol, and health care and educa
tion for all children, even illegal
immigrants.
Tie has asserted that Republicans
should moderate the party's views
on issues to improve its chances in
the November election. That ideolo
gy was rejected — 52 percent to 40
percent —by likely GOP primary
voters surveyed in the Times poll.
