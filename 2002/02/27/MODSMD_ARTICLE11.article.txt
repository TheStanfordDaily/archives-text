## The
						Stanford Daily Implicit racism warrants continued vigilance 
### 
Published Since 1891

Speaking at Kresge Auditorium on Mon
day in conjunction with Black Libera
tion Month, UC-Santa Cruz Prof. An
gela Davis issued a powerful statement
to the Stanford community: Racism mutates
and changes, but it still persists.
In light of the points Davis raised in her
speech, members of the Stanford community
should take time to re-examine how far we
have come in combating racism and what steps
we can continue to take academically and per
sonally to ameliorate the situation.
Where once racism was marked by blatant
exclusion and segregation, it now percolates
beneath the surface of the Stanford communi
ty. It exists in the uneasiness of students who
hesitate to attend an event sponsored by an
ethnic group other than their own. It exists in
the perception of ethnic theme dormitories as
inhospitable to members of other races, in the

tension one feels as the only non-white or white
person in a classroom, in the looks that inter
racial couples receive when sitting together
outside a library, and in people's views on eth
nic profiling following the Sept. 11 attacks.
Beyond the boundaries of the campus,
these issues permeate society more visibly.
Davis's talk drew attention to the institutional
ization of racism within the federal prison sys
tem and the ways Stanford students can work
to change it.
Statistics can mean different things to differ
ent people, but the fact that 2.8 million black
people sit in jail indicates a problem that needs
further examination.
The standard response to news of such
problems is to call for educational reform. But
reform may not be sufficient — California out
spends all other states in construction of new
prisons, but ranks 41st in education expendi

ture per capita.
Dorsey Nunn, an activist from East Palo
Alto, challenged students at the event to take
an active role in changing both the disparity in
numbers of minority prisoners and the lack of
educational funding.
Students should heed Nunn's call by taking
advantage of the myriad opportunities for ser
vice in the local community. Tutoring in East
Palo Alto helps one child at a time while foster
ing a child's hope that one day he, too, may at
tend college.
Beyond the grassroots level, Davis sug
gested examining the economic situation un
derlying prison systems as a means of student
involvement. Academic work evaluating
racial profiling, study of the policies that lead
to socioeconomic inequality and critical ex
amination of the criminal justice system are
just a few examples of how students can use

their intellectual pursuits to address these
seemingly remote issues of injustice in the
prison system.
If racism does indeed mutate, then solutions
also need to evolve to keep up with the prob
lem. As broad and vague as the issue may seem,
the bottom line is that racial tension emanates
from the attitudes of individuals.
No one in the Stanford community is im
mune to this tension, and all must do their part
— whether through service, academic work or
even just introspection —to recognize and
combat manifestations of racism in themselves,
on campus and in society at large.
Thus, as Black Liberation Month draws to
an end, we challenge everyone to think about
the issues that Davis and others have spoken
about in the last few weeks — these issues run
longer than a month, and they merit vigilant
attention the whole year round.
