# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Slobber, vomit and pee: reflections on a frat party 
### 
I came home on Friday night to find a
horde of tube-topped girls pushing
their way into my house like a rebel
army storming the palace gates. The
bass beat of "Back That Azz Up" rattled
the windows of the house across the street,
and through the steamy sliding glass
doors I saw a throng of people under an
eerie red light gyrating like souls in some
forgotten circle of Dante's hell.
In the interest of promoting campus
life and collecting a $500 security deposit,
we had agreed to host a fi at party.
I am not a connoisseur of fi at parties,
and the arrival of one in my home re
minded me why. First of all, of the ap-

proximately 2,300 peo
ple present, I did not rec
ognize a single face. I
don't think any of these
people actually went to
Stanford. I think most of
them were rented from a
party supply company as
extras to make the party,
and the frat hosting it, ap-

pear happening. The rest were Paly High
kids, some of whom prepared for the big
night by shaving for the first time.
To get to my room I pushed to the back
of the house and headed for another en
trance, since taking the stairs would have
required touching far too many revelers
covered in various bodily fluids.
Sitting 011 the bench outside the side
door were a guy and a girl, kissing. Well,
maybe they were kissing. It is possible
that both of them gasped for air, passed
out and fell into each other's faces at the
same time.
Maybe all kissing looks that slobbery
and desperate. I lowever, the only way to
find out would be to videotape yourself
kissing and then watch, occasionally cir
cling the screen with a grease pencil to
highlight problem spots. By the time I
got to the door the couple had separated
for air, and I had the privilege of
overhearing:
Guy: This doesn't make you uncom
fortable, does it? I just really feel a connec
tion to you.
Girl: No. No, it doesn't. I like it.
His T-shirt strained at his biceps. Her
bosom heaved. They fell into each other's
faces once again.
Once upstairs I changed into my pa
jamas (party pajamas, mind you) and
went to the bathroom to get ready for
bed. On the way I passed a girl frantical
ly jiggling the door handle of the room
that has the women's bathroom sign on
it, which of course is not actually the
women's bathroom.
The real women's bathroom is behind a
door with two guys' names on it. Their
room is behind the door with the women's
bath rex mi sign. Somebody switched the

two signs weeks ago, thinking it would be
funny, and it was.
It is lime to switch them back; however,
these two guys are still living behind the
women's bathroom sign in the desperate
hope that it will lure girls to their room.
This would be a great plan, except that
any girls who do fall for it are either about
to vomit or pee.
Inside the bathroom, a girl wearing
something that could have been a blouse,
but might also have been a pillowcase that
someone told her was a blouse as a joke,
was gazing into the mirror while her
friends applied eyeliner. (As a side note,
there has to be some point at which the
eyeliner becomes thick enough that it no
longer qualifies as a "line" but an eye
patch. Arr, matey!)
This girl, who might possibly have con
sumed some alcoholic beverages earlier in
the evening, was standing in front of the
mirror in a billowy, zebra-striped blouse,
waving her arms up and down and saying
in a voice not unlike nails on a blackboard,
"Look! I'm like a bird! I'm flying! I'm so
totally like a bird! Look!"
It is a miracle that this girl's friends
have allowed her to live this long.
Women use the bathroom for four
things during a party â€” going to the bath
room, applying makeup / adjusting un
dergarments, gossiping, and leaning over
a toilet while a friend holds their ponytail
out of the way, crying, "Oh [insert name of
friend], I'm so sorry (blech), you're the
best, I (blech) looooove you."
Why can't girls throw up alone? When
I get sick by myself, I feel disgusting and
wretched. When I get sick with one or two
of my friends crammed into the stall with
me, patting my back and watching as I
clutch my head in shame, I feel disgusting,
wretched and loved.
There has to be some biological basis
for the difference between men and
women's reactions to a nauseous person.
Women will trip over themselves to get
water, rub your back and create a sup
portive, nurturing environment con
ducive to spewing.
Guys can also be considerate, but in a
different way. When I would travel as a kid
with my boy cousins and one of us got car
sick, my cousins would lean over, place a
concerned hand on your arm, and say re
assuringly, "Whatever you do, don't think
about warm mayonnaise."
Anyway, the party eventually wound to
a close, leaving behind the warm glow of
memories and minor property damage.
From what I could tell, it seemed like peo
ple had a pretty good time. For some, it
might have been the best night of their
lives. At least until prom.
