Davis talk deserved coverage
Angela Davis's talk on the Prison-In
dustrial Complex was a memorable event,
central to the movement to make students
more aware of the important global issues
that affect both them and the world
around them. As such, I feel that students
who were not able to attend but would
have picked up a copy of The Daily the
next day to read about the event should
have been able to do so.
I am disappointed to hear that The
Daily's newspaper staff was unable to
appoint a reporter to attend and some
how record this historical occasion. It is
not every day that we are able to share
our campus with such an amazing figure
as Davis. I do believe there was enough
advertisement of this event that the
Daily staff should have known about it.
It has been advertised on all of the Black
Liberation Month posters, which are
prominently displayed all around
campus.
Members of the Stanford community
have worked hard to get Davis to come
share her message with our campus.
Please strongly consider covering this
monumental event in the next edition of
The Daily.

'Rhythms' successfully integrated art,
political message
In theory. I am a member of both San
skriti and Spoons, but having become an
ostrich in the way that only graduate stu

dents can, I have never been to a meeting
of either. I am truly delighted that I went
to "Rhythms."
Not only did it have a wonderful blend
of music and dance from across the
globe — truly multicultural — but it also
was able to speak about hunger and
poverty to a huge audience.
It is often very easy for those of us at
Stanford to forget about the rest of the
world — to forget that only 1 percent of
the world's population has a university
degree and that nearly 800 million peo
ple on this planet are hungry — that's
tens of thousands of Stanford Universi
ties in starvation.
It's not easy to project such a message to
a big audience. Often, we would rather
think about our brand new Banana Re
public jacket than have to worry about
someone starving in the street.
What Sanskriti and Spoons did was
wonderful. Amid a truly entertaining
show that attracted a large crowd, they
conveyed a very deep message — that as
much as we do not want any of these won
derful dance forms or music to die, we do
not want the people of these dance forms
or music to die either.
It takes courage to tell South Asians
or anyone else, "People from your
home are starving in large numbers.
What are you going to do about it?" and
it seems to me that the organizers of this
show had the courage, strength and
wisdom to ask exactly this question to a
large audience. I certainly hope this is
not the last event of this sort that we see
on this campus.

Palo Alto resident criticizes Perry speech
I was disappointed by former Secretary
of Defense William Perry's address to stu
dents on Monday about how we should re
spond to international terrorism after
Sept. 11.
He outlined the threats to our security
and how we should respond to them but
failed to mention possible underlying
causes of international terrorism such as
world hunger, international wealth dis
crepancies or how we might address these
issues as the world's only superpower.
Will our anti-terrorism measures in the
name of "homeland security" and our im
perialism in the name of "nation-building"
causes as much misery in the 21 st century
as our relentless anti-communism did in
the 20th century?
Will we again witness the suppression
of self-determination abroad, erosion of
civil liberties at home and neglect of our
pressing social problems as we build up
our military and security operations?

Males must do their part to combat
female body-image problems
1 applaud Jen Wekselbaum's excellent
and much-needed column on eating dis
orders (" fime to examine ourselves,"
2 / 25). I would like to emphasize the idea
that female body image in our society is
not a problem with which only females
should concern themselves. There is a lot
that all of us males can do to help.
First, males need to become much
more aware of the problem and its gravity.
It's understandable that males know less
about female eating disorders than fe
males do, but if we make the effort to un
derstand the problem better, we will un
doubtedly be more perceptive and sensi
tive about it.
Second, we should be very careful
about the messages related to female body
image that we convey to females. Subtle
put-downs related to someone's body
shape can be extremely destructive.
In my early teen years I made a number
of remarks like that to someone close to
me, just because I knew she was sensitive
to that kind of teasing. This person went
on to experience some significant eating
disorders at different points in her
young adulthood: and these problems
were surely related in part, at least, to the
comments coming from me and other

people. The irony is that this person al
ways had a beautiful figure.
This not uncommon irony brings me
to my last point. We males would do well
to think carefully about our view of fe
male attractiveness, and how it is influ
enced by the ideal created by the modern
media. In the caveman / cavewoman
days, I imagine that female beauty was
defined much more by how healthy and
strong females appeared. To the extent
that we can restore these ideals, we'll all
be happier and healthier.

Positive body image starts
with self-acceptance
In her column on Monday ("Time to
Examine Ourselves"), Jen Wekselbaum
exhibited extraordinary courage in com
ing to terms with her personal struggles
with weight and body image. I was sur
prised to see her article, as disorders of eat
ing and body perception are often mani
fested in self-negating, self-destructive be

haviors that people consider too shameful
to talk about.
I myself write this letter as a person
who fights the "mentality of disordered
eating" and/or body perception on a
daily basis. I'm not anorexic 01 bulimic,
but I tend to eat when I'm happy, sad or
indifferent, ft is a behavior that has
evolved from bouts of starvation in mid
dle school and high school interspersed
with times of compulsive eating as well as
periods of over-exercising. I thought it
was evidence that I was fitness-minded,
but what I realize now is that it stems
from a lack of self-acceptance, a persis
tent displeasure with my body.
Competing messages from my Nigeri
an culture tliat praises fat as beautiful,
black culture that prides itself on "thick
thighs," and a middle-class neighborhood
of "wannabe supermodels" are factors I'm
sure, but none have the impact of simple
words, spoken to me by more people than
I care to count.
Maya Angelou knowingly stated that
"words are like glue," and over time I
think I've internalized every bad word
people consciously or unconsciously spoke
to me about my body, until I began to use

(bod to light my own self. My body has
been a problem to be resolved, as opposed
to a blessing to lie praised.
It seems to me that the best place to
begin improving disorders of eating and
body perception is self-acceptance, with
the acknowledgement that one's body is a
gilt, not a curse.
