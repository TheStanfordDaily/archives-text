ic 10 Conference).

WOMEN'S SWIMMING/ DIVING

Thursday-Saturday: No. 1 Stanford
competes in the Pac-10 Championships, 10
a.m., Long Beich, CA

The swimmers left yesterday for Long
Beach, (.alii., tor the Pac-10 Conference
Championships. Boasting a record of 13 con
secutive wins dating hack to last season, the
Cardinal is confident yet determined to work
as hard as ever to capture the titles that it
thinks it deserves.
"Despite our perfect record, a Stanford vic
tory is not guaranteed," senior co-captain
Shelly Ripple said. "We're going to have to
fight for it. Everyone on our team needs to im
prove and swim very fast in order for us to win
the meet."
No. 4 Cal, No. 7. Arizona, and No. 10
Southern California are its greatest threats.
The Bears are led by sophomore Natalie
Coughin, who has the nation's top times in six
events. Named 2001 Pac-10 Swimmer of the
Year, Coughlin was the champion and
record-holder in the 100-yard butterfly, 100
backstroke and 200 backstroke at last year's
NCAA Championships.
The Wildcats swept 14 of the 10 events in
their recent meet against No. 11 Arizona State.
They are strongest in the relays, primarily the
200 medley with sophomore Jessica Wagner,
Ail-American Amv Bouta, Jenny Vanker and
Beth Botsford.
The USC Trojans, on the other hand, boast

the top divers in the nation. Freshman Blythe
Hartley, who has beat Stanford divers at every
common meet this season, is a favorite to win
the NCAA title this year. Senior Kellie Brennan
w as Pac-10 Conference champion last year in
both the 1- and 3-meter springboard events.
Still, the Cardinal divers are strong.
1 hey have contributed the winning points at
many close meets this season. Junior McKenze
Murphy won the 1- and 3-meter events at the
recent Cal meet with career-best of 288.75 and
307.20, respectively.
Another advantage Stanford has this year is
its depth.
"If we do what we can do, we should have
five or six people in the top ten in every event,"
said senior diving captain Kim Powers. "The
Pac-10 [Championship] is an exciting meet so
I'm just going to go out and have fun and use it
as just another learning experience leading up
to the zone meet in a couple weeks."
This year's Pac-10 Conference Champi
onships presents a unique situation because the
swimming and diving competitions will be in
separate pools. The Conference diving meet
w ill take place in Tucson, Ariz, at the Hillen
brand Aquatic Center.

"The divers wish the best of luck to the
swimmers," Murphy said. "Even though we
won't be together, that can't keep the Cardi
nal from dominating."
Stanford suffered at last year's Pac-10
Championship, placing fourth overall due to
lack of depth.
But, with the addition of 14 new swimmers,
things should be different this season.
Leading the Cardinal are sophomore Tara
Kirk and senior co-captains Shelly Ripple and
Jessica Foschi.
Kirk has had an amazing two seasons at
Stanford, beating Olympian Staciana Stitts in
both the 100 and 200 breaststroke at the Cal
meet two weeks ago.
Ripple is a veteran NCAA champion in the
200 and 400 medley relay events. This season,
she has qualified for the NCAA Championships
in 11 events and remains unbeaten in the 200
fly after eight consecutive wins.
Foschi, the reigning NCAA c hampion in the
500 freestyle, is undefeated this season and
boasts 18 consecutive wins in the event dating
back to last season.
