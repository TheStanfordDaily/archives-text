After defeating the Bruins in the
championship game of the Stan
ford Invitational two weeks ago,
the Cardinal edged out UCLA
again this weekend, defeating it in
overtime to win the Santa Barbara
Gaucho Invitational.
Entering the final stretch of
the title match one goal down,
the Cardinal sent the game into
overtime with a goal by sopho
more Wendy Watkins.
In the first of the two over
time periods, the Bruins hit
first, scoring in the first period
to take a one- goal lead. This
lead held until the final seconds
of the second overtime period
when senior Margie Di n -
geldein found the back of the
net with less then 10 seconds
remaining to send the game
into sudden death at 5-5.

In the golden goal situation, it
was then up to Stanford's leading
scorer, sophomore Brenda Villa.
She once again came tip big for her
team, scoring the match's winning
goal in the third overtime period.
"We showed great composure
against UCLA in the champi
onship game," said head coach
John Tanner. "Good results help
because it kind of gives you the
sense that you can build and con
tinue to win."
The Cardinal earned the
right to face UCLA in the
championship match by defeat
ing Pacific (11-2) and Long
Beach State (8-3) in match play
followed by a victory over Cali
fornia (9-4) in the semifinals.
Despite only scoring one goal
in the first quarter, the Cardinal
picked up the intensity with
four goals in the second to take
a 5-1 halftime lead, which
proved insurmountable.
Villa led the offensive surge
with three goals against Long
Beach and four in the semifinal
match against Cal, while her
Olympic counterpart, senior
Ellen Estes, had two against the
Golden Bears. Watkins also
stepped up, scoring twice in
both the Pacific and Long
Beach State matches.
"We've had good, solid contri
butions [offensively] from many
people," Tanner said. "[That's]
important because if a team focus
es on one scorer, we have other
people with the ability to step up."
This win in the Santa Bar
bara tournament ends the first
phase of the team's season, as it
