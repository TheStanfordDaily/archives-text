Saturday was a big day for
Stanford women's lacrosse. The
crowd of parents, friends, and
local lacrosse fans was one of t lie
largest the program has ever
seen. No. 10 Syracuse, had trav
eled across the country for the
sole purpose of facing the Car
dinal in the first East-West Chal

Coast opponents St. Mary's and

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

Saturday: No. 10 Syracuse
15, Stanford 9

Saturday: Stanford vs.
Cornell, 1 p.m., New Moloney
Field

UC-Davis the previous week,
this would be Stanford's first
chance to face a ranked oppo
nent.
It therefore might seem that
the final score of 15-9 was a dis

appointment for the Cardinal.
However, the intense level of
play is one that the Cardinal will
build on over the duration of
the season.
"Syracuse showed our team
that we are capable of a great in
tensity," said Stanford head
coach Michele Uhlfelder. "This is
the same intensity which we have
been working so hard on at prac
tice, and it was obvious today that
our team had no intentions of
backing down."
The game opened with two
Syracuse goals in the first five
minutes of play.
Stanford sophomore Jess
Scott was quick to answer,
though, as she tallied a goal for
the Cardinal at 5:26. Soon after
the draw, she regained posses
sion of the ball and ran straight
down the field scoring past the
Syracuse goal-keeper to score
her second goal of the match.
Syracuse went forward with a
four-goal streak, bringing the
halftime score to 8-4.
The second half began with
Stanford lowering the point gap
with a goal by freshman
Alessandra Salatti" 39 seconds
into the half. Additional goals
were tallied by senior co-captain
Liz Britt, sophomore Abbi Hills
and freshmen Kelsey Twist and
Julia Calzonetti.
Despite an impressive 11 saves
from junior Virginia Solomon,
Syracuse scored seven goals in
the second half.
Throughout both halves,
Stanford showed off a very re
spectable throwing and catching
game with consistently smooth
midfield transitions.
The defense, led by sopho
mores Katie Grube, Hills, and
Larissa Conte, felt that its defen
sive mission was accomplished.
"I think our defense really
slowed down [Syracuse's] fast
break," said senior co-captain
Emily Rodriguez. "Our goal was
to make them play to our tempo."
The Cardinal can be proud
of the strong game exhibited by
its freshmen. Twist, Nina Pan-

tano, and Anthea Tjuanakis
(who came back to play aggres
sively after suffering a head
wound earlier in the game) were
a strong force on defense and
were instrumental in beginning
the midfield transitions.
Despite successful execution of
many of the skills the Cardinal has

been practicing, the hungry Syra
cuse team was able to control the
way much of the game went.
"We now know the intensity we
are capable of," said Uhlfelder.
"However, Syracuse dictated our
intensity, and we can't let our op
ponents do that to us. We're going
to use [Syracuse] as a good
teacher, and take these lessons
[with us]."
Stanford will need these lessons
when it faces off against Cornell
this coming Saturday at 2 p.m.
