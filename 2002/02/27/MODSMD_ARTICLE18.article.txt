If you aren't too careful, you
might actually think you're
watching a remake of Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde instead of a
men's gymnastics meet.
How else would you explain the
inconsistency that has plagued the
No. 11 Cardinal men's gymnastics
team (4-7), as it completed a road

trip to Southern California by los
ing twice to No. 2 Illinois and No. 7
California, in two separate meets?
To be sure, the Cardinal's
trip was far from a failure, as
the team resoundingly beat No.

Yet four meets into the season,
the team figures to have a long way

to go before the NCAA Champi
onships, if it harbors any dreams of
giving its 30-year veteran head
coach, Sadao Hamada a retire
ment gift.
The team's inconsistency was
out in full force this weekend, as
the Cardinal had some great
highlights but could to do little to
significantly improve its score.
At Saturday's meet, in Santa
Barbara's Rob Gym, the Cardi
nal achieved its second-highest
total score of the season, a
206.675. Junior Marshall Erwin
claimed first place on rings with
a meet-high 9.775, the highest
score for him on that event since
his freshman campaign.
Some other familiar names
aided the Cardinal in its third
place finish, with junior David Du
rante taking second on the pom
mel horse and third on l ings, with

a 9.400 and a 9.300, respectively.
Sophomore Daniel Gill was also
solid, garnering second place on
the floor routine at Santa Barbara
with a 9.150.
Despite these strong perfor
mances, the Cardinal again came
out Hat on the parallel bars and
high bar, something that has been
emblematic of the team's season so
far. And with roughly five points
separating the Cardinal from the
meet's top two teams, Illinois and
Cal, Stanford will need a bigjump

to join the nation's elite.
If anything, the Cardinal will
concentrate on increasing its en
durance in the weeks ahead, in
hopes of greatly improving its
score in the final events of its meets.
Stanford will finally get the
chance to face some other
teams - it has competed against
the Golden Bears four times
this season, in addition to fac
ing the Gauchos and Fighting
Illini twice.
The Cardinal will get the
opportunity to shed its Mr.
Hyde tendencies as it faces No.

next two weeks.
