At the University of Michigan's Maize and
Blue Invitational, the team faced its toughest
competition, Ohio State. Although Stanford won
the team, trio, solo, duet and elements events,
the team ended up with 99 points, second to
Ohio State's 102 point total.
"The results from the Michigan Invitational
are frustrating," said sophomore Joanne Taylor.
"We won every event we entered, but because
Ohio is a bigger team and can enter more events,
they can beat us."
Despite this frustration, the team has contin
ued to dominate its competition. The Cardinal
returned home from the Western Regional
Championships on Sunday where it faced Ari
zona and Washington. The results mirror those
from the first competition of the season: first and

Collegiate Nationals, held this

year at Wheaton during finals
week, is the meet that the team
has been preparing for all season.
"I have faith in our team this
year, more than any other team
I've been on," said sophomore
Erin Dobratz. "I don't think we
can win collegiate nationals. I
know we can."
This coming weekend is the
first weekend that the team will
not have a competition. How

will perform an exhibition at
Avery Aquatic Center at 1 p.m.
