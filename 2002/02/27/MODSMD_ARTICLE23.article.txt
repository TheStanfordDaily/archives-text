The Cardinal isn't interested in just winning
its matches this weekend. When you're the de
fending NCAA champions, you want to do
more than just win.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Friday: No. 3 Stanford vs. Oregon, 1:30
p.m., Taube Family Tennis Stadium

Saturday: No. 3 Stanford vs. San Diego
State, 12:00 p.m., Taube Family Tennis
Stadium

Coming oil Of an impressive 7-0 shutout of
No. 14 California (5-1), the No. 3 Cardinal
women's tennis team (8-1) hopes to dominate
its opponents in similar fashion this weekend.
Stanford hosts No. 59 Oregon (6-3) at 1:30
on Friday, and No. 42 San Diego State (4-2) at
noon on Saturday.
"Hopefully we can shut out both teams this
weekend and show that we can take every team
out [like we did Cal]," sophomore Lauren
Barnikow said.
Oregon is a familiar Pacific 10 Conference
foe; San Diego State is a virtual unknown.
Senior Gabriela Lastra explained that, al
though the Aztecs had been scheduled before,
the current Cardinal squad has never actually
played them due to rainouts.
"We won't take anything for granted," Las
tra said. "It's good to play someone you don't
know anything about because you just go out
and play."
"This weekend, obviously they're not as
tough [as Cal], but we just take every match
as a building block," sophomore Emilia An-

derson said.
Oregon has no ranked players or doubles
teams. The Aztecs" Silvia Tornier is ranked No.
72 nationally, and she and Lindsey Hedberg
form the country's No. 52 doubles team.
Meanwhile, Stanford remained strong in the
new rankings, released Feb. 22.
Barnikow is the team's top-ranked singles
player at No. 9, and is followed closely by No. 11
senior Lauren Kalvaria, No. 15 freshman Erin
Burdetteand No. 16 Lastra.
Also ranked for the Cardinal is senior Keiko
Tokuda at No. 103 and — for the first time —
freshman Story Tweedie- Yates, who debuted at
No. 132 in the national polls.

In doubles, Stanford is similarly strong.
Kalvaria and Lastra form the nation's No. 2
tandem and Barnikow and Burdette are
the No. 8 duo.
Lastra explained that the rankings
meant more to some players than to others,
but that "in the end what counts is the ITA
team ranking."
The Cardinal is playing matches on consec
utive days this weekend, but fatigue is not ex
pected to be a big factor.
"You can get a little bit tired, but we've all
played tournaments before, where you can play
three matches in a day, and the tournament
goes on fora week," Lastra said.
