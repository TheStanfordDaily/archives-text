# Smallest infant to undergo heart surgery emerges healthy
## Packard cardiac surgeon performs open-heart operation 
### YASI HASHEMI EDITORIAL STAFF 
Serena Brown of Sacramento
recently made medical history at
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal as (he youngest and smallest
baby to successfully undergo open
heart surgery.
Brown was healthy enough
after the surgery to be transferred
to the neonatal intensive care unit
at Sutter Memorial Hospital in
Sacramento last Thursday.
Serena was one of a set of
triplets born prematurely on Dec.
27 after a 25-week gestation peri
od. Immediately after birth she
was diagnosed with total anom
alous pulmonary venous return, a
rare congenital heart abnormality
in which the veins connecting the
lungs to the heart are attached to
the wrong side of the heart. The
condition makes it impossible for
oxygen-rich blood from the lungs
to circulate properly.
Serena's heart condition was not
related to her prematurity.
The operation — her only pos
sible means of survival — was per
formed to reroute veins around
her heart. • -
According to Dr. Frank L. Han

ley, director of the Children's
Heart Center at the hospital, the
procedure saved Brown's litis and
was an advance for medical science
in this field.
Heart operations have been
performed at the hospital on
over 100 premature or under
weight babies, but Brown is the
smallest known to have under
gone such a procedure.
Dr. V. Mohan Reddy, chief of
pediatric cardiac surgery at the
hospital, performed the surgery.
"The operation gives her a
chance," Reddy said Thursday.
"Otherwise there is a 100 percent
risk of death. Her prognosis now
should be like any other 25-week
premature baby. There are a lot of
hoops she's going to have to jump
through and lung problems can be
an issue."
Prior to the operation, Brown
was kept alive by a naturally occur
ring hole between the two halves of
her heart that normally seals itself
shortly after birth. Reddy sealed
this hole through surgery and also
re-attached the veins to their cor
rect sides of the heart.
According to Hanley, the baby
was connected to a heart-lung ma
chine during the procedure,
which was a problem because of
her small size.
At the time of the operation,
Brown weighed only 1.4 pounds,
about five times smaller than the
average newborn infant. Her heart

was the size of a grape and her
chest the size of an adult's palm.
"Her chest was smaller than
my palm, and her heart was the
size of the tip of my thumb,"
Reddy said. "To the best of my
knowledge, she is the youngest
baby ever to have open-heart
surgery, and the smallest."
"Most surgeons don't do this
operation before 1,000 grains
[about two pounds]," Reddy said.

"It's technically difficult, and, in
infants this premature, the risks
are extremely high. But if you
don't do anything, the baby will
not survive."
According to nurse Kristen
Braccia, Brown handled the opera
tion well. At a current weight of ap
proximately 900 grams, she is now
capable of breathing without a ven
tilator, but is still receiving oxygen.
"She's been through quite a

bit," Braccia said Thursday. "She's
really turned the corner. She's
doing really well. She truly is a
miracle . . . She's been very alert
and very active."
Brown is expected to live a nor
mal life.
Reddy praised the efforts of the
team of specialists involved, noting
that the operation would not have
been successful without much
preparation.

"This kind of operation takes a
lot of planning and teamwork,"
Reddy said. "We had very good
support and the team worked very
well together. The neonatal respi
ratory team did an excellent, out
standing job. Although 1 do the
surgery, the team has to be com
pletely focused, because no one has
done an infant this small before."
Brown's sister, Jocelyn, passed
away days after Brown's operation
due to necrotizing enterocolitis, a
rare and severe inflammation of
the intestines in which tissue begins
to decompose.
Brown's other sister, Brianna,
has also been hospitalized at Sut
ter Memorial until she gains a
sufficient amount of weight but
has not suffered from any med
ical complications.
News of Brown's procedure was
not made public until she was well
on her way to recovery.
Joshua and Lori Brown, her
parents, expressed happiness over
the success of the operation and
Brown's transfer to a hospital clos
er to home.
"We'll be able to see both of
them more often, and I'll be able to
hold Serena," Lori Brown said
Thursday. "I haven't been able to
hold her yet. We'll be able to be
closer to her emotionally and phys
ically. It feels strange not being able
to hold your child. It's against a
mother's nature being so far from
her child."

Serena was one of a set of
triplets born prematurely on Dec.
27 after a 25-week gestation peri
od. Immediately after birth she
was diagnosed with total anom
alous pulmonary venous return, a
rare congenital heart abnormality
in which the veins connecting the
lungs to the heart are attached to
the wrong side of the heart. The
condition makes it impossible for
oxygen-rich blood from the lungs
to circulate properly.
Serena's heart condition was not
related to her prematurity.
The operation — her only pos
sible means of survival — was per
formed to reroute veins around
her heart. • -
According to Dr. Frank L. Han

ley, director of the Children's
Heart Center at the hospital, the
procedure saved Brown's litis and
was an advance for medical science
in this field.
Heart operations have been
performed at the hospital on
over 100 premature or under
weight babies, but Brown is the
smallest known to have under
gone such a procedure.
Dr. V. Mohan Reddy, chief of
pediatric cardiac surgery at the
hospital, performed the surgery.
"The operation gives her a
chance," Reddy said Thursday.
"Otherwise there is a 100 percent
risk of death. Her prognosis now
should be like any other 25-week
premature baby. There are a lot of
hoops she's going to have to jump
through and lung problems can be
an issue."
Prior to the operation, Brown
was kept alive by a naturally occur
ring hole between the two halves of
her heart that normally seals itself
shortly after birth. Reddy sealed
this hole through surgery and also
re-attached the veins to their cor
rect sides of the heart.
According to Hanley, the baby
was connected to a heart-lung ma
chine during the procedure,
which was a problem because of
her small size.
At the time of the operation,
Brown weighed only 1.4 pounds,
about five times smaller than the
average newborn infant. Her heart

was the size of a grape and her
chest the size of an adult's palm.
"Her chest was smaller than
my palm, and her heart was the
size of the tip of my thumb,"
Reddy said. "To the best of my
knowledge, she is the youngest
baby ever to have open-heart
surgery, and the smallest."
"Most surgeons don't do this
operation before 1,000 grains
[about two pounds]," Reddy said.

"It's technically difficult, and, in
infants this premature, the risks
are extremely high. But if you
don't do anything, the baby will
not survive."
According to nurse Kristen
Braccia, Brown handled the opera
tion well. At a current weight of ap
proximately 900 grams, she is now
capable of breathing without a ven
tilator, but is still receiving oxygen.
"She's been through quite a

bit," Braccia said Thursday. "She's
really turned the corner. She's
doing really well. She truly is a
miracle . . . She's been very alert
and very active."
Brown is expected to live a nor
mal life.
Reddy praised the efforts of the
team of specialists involved, noting
that the operation would not have
been successful without much
preparation.

"This kind of operation takes a
lot of planning and teamwork,"
Reddy said. "We had very good
support and the team worked very
well together. The neonatal respi
ratory team did an excellent, out
standing job. Although 1 do the
surgery, the team has to be com
pletely focused, because no one has
done an infant this small before."
Brown's sister, Jocelyn, passed
away days after Brown's operation
due to necrotizing enterocolitis, a
rare and severe inflammation of
the intestines in which tissue begins
to decompose.
Brown's other sister, Brianna,
has also been hospitalized at Sut
ter Memorial until she gains a
sufficient amount of weight but
has not suffered from any med
ical complications.
News of Brown's procedure was
not made public until she was well
on her way to recovery.
Joshua and Lori Brown, her
parents, expressed happiness over
the success of the operation and
Brown's transfer to a hospital clos
er to home.
"We'll be able to see both of
them more often, and I'll be able to
hold Serena," Lori Brown said
Thursday. "I haven't been able to
hold her yet. We'll be able to be
closer to her emotionally and phys
ically. It feels strange not being able
to hold your child. It's against a
mother's nature being so far from
her child."

Serena Brown was prematurely born on Dec. 27 after only 25 weeks of gestation. She underwent open-heart surgery
on Jan. 11 to correct a rare congenital heart disorder. The operation ultimately saved her life.
Serena Brown of Sacramento
recently made medical history at
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
