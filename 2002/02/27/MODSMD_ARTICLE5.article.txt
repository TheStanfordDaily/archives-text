# SOCA organizes an 'affair'

### GEORGE K. TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts will be hosting its third annual An
Art Affair, a celebration of visual arts, per
forming arts and creative writing at White
Plaza on Friday, April 5.
The event was first conceived in 2000

by senior Seth Cohen,
founder and president of
the committee.
"I chose to develop the
event because 1 sensed Stan
ford was home to a phenom
enal variety of artistic talent
and endeavor," Cohen said.
"I felt these artists deserved
some platform for expres
sion and [at the timel there
didn't seem to be an appro
priate opportunity available
on campus."

Junior Scott Cannon, logistics coordina
tor, noted the wide variety of presentations
he has seen at the event in previous years.
"The diversity is really phenomenal," he
said. "You could spend an hour at An Art Af
fair and witness a lively salsa performance,
watch an intriguing student film, see award

winning oils and watercolors and dance to a
hip-hop group, all while enjoying free food
from student chefs."
Sophomore Lauren Wechsler, perfor
mance coordinator, cited a similar level of
diversity in the performance groups regis
tered this year.
"So far, 49 performance groups have
signed up, and they include everything

from salsa, swing dance,
bands and solo musical per
formers to baton twirling,
monologues, Korean drum
ming, martial arts and more,"
Wechsler said.
However, sophomore
Joan MacMillan, coordinator
of visual arts, pointed out a
common theme amid the di
versity of the presentations.
"The slogan [this year] is
'art by you, for you,' "

MacMillan said.
Submission for the event remains open
until March 1 and is widely encouraged by
the committee.
"Any student, staff, or faculty artist is wel
come to be a part of An Art Affair," Cannon

said. "We enthusiastically invite
anyone with an artistic passion to
share their talents at the festival."
MacMillan echoed this
invitation.
"We'd like anyone and every
one to submit and we don't turn
anyone down," she said. "If it is art
then we want it out there."
Submission is a two-part
process done entirely online. Stu
dents interested in presenting at
the event should visit the commit
tee Web site and complete the
signup form. When committee
representatives receive this form,
they will provide the artist with a
link to a second, more detailed
form that asks for logistical infor
mation and program notes.
Organizers of the event said
they expect a large crowd for the
celebration.
"Our turnout for An Art Af
fair has always been terrific both
in regard to spectators and sub
missions," MacMillan said.
"Even last year, when it rained
all day, people came out to enjoy
the event, taking shelter under
the tents."
Cohen also pointed out previ

ous years' attendance of Stanford
officials with an interest in art.
"We have consistently enjoyed
the presence of [Dean of Students]
Marc Wais, [former Vice-Provost
for Student Affairs] Jim Montoya
and [University] President John
Hennessy," Cohen said.
Even with this level of partici
pation, committee representatives
encourage more people to come.
"These artists deserve to have
hundreds, if not thousands, of
audience members crowding
White Plaza," Cohen said. "1
would love to see more people at
tending the event."
Such a large audience helps to
foster a sense of balance in the
University, according to senior
Joyce Shih, who attended the
event last year.
"Stanford is stellar in many
areas, such as academics and ath
letics, but it's inspiring to see peo
ple's artistic talents showcased as
well," Shih said.
Senior Nathan Lasche, who will
be presenting his art in this year's
event, also commented on the
benefits of such a venue.
"An Art Affair is a wonderful
opportunity for the Stanford com
munity to showcase its hidden tal
ent," Lasche said.
In addition to observing such
talent, students have yet another

incentive to join the festivities, the
committee will be distributing
free copies of the premier "Stan
ford Soundtrack."
"The first-ever 'Stanford
Soundtrack' is a CD compilation
of songs from 18 Stanford bands
and songwriters available free to
students," Cannon said. "We'll
[also] be having a release party
that night with some great perfor
mances by the musicians."
The event is sponsored by nu
merous campus organizations.
"The ASSU is a major benefac
tor through special fees," Can
non said. "The vice-provost for
undergraduate education, the
president and provost, the Dean
of Students Office, The Stanford
Fund, the dean of humanities
and sciences and the Alumni As
sociation also provide generous
â– financial support."
The funding has helped the
committee significantly develop
and expand An Art Affair over the
past three years.
"I have been privileged to
watch this event grow from a
vague idea in a Wilbur lounge to
something real that people can
enjoy and value," Cohen said.
