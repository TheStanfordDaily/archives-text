The Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts will be hosting its third annual An
Art Affair, a celebration of visual arts, per
forming arts and creative writing at White
Plaza on Friday, April 5.
The event was first conceived in 2000

by senior Seth Cohen,
founder and president of
the committee.
"I chose to develop the
event because 1 sensed Stan
ford was home to a phenom
enal variety of artistic talent
and endeavor," Cohen said.
"I felt these artists deserved
some platform for expres
sion and [at the timel there
didn't seem to be an appro
priate opportunity available
on campus."

Junior Scott Cannon, logistics coordina
tor, noted the wide variety of presentations
he has seen at the event in previous years.
"The diversity is really phenomenal," he
said. "You could spend an hour at An Art Af
fair and witness a lively salsa performance,
watch an intriguing student film, see award

winning oils and watercolors and dance to a
hip-hop group, all while enjoying free food
from student chefs."
Sophomore Lauren Wechsler, perfor
mance coordinator, cited a similar level of
diversity in the performance groups regis
tered this year.
"So far, 49 performance groups have
signed up, and they include everything

from salsa, swing dance,
bands and solo musical per
formers to baton twirling,
monologues, Korean drum
ming, martial arts and more,"
Wechsler said.
However, sophomore
Joan MacMillan, coordinator
of visual arts, pointed out a
common theme amid the di
versity of the presentations.
"The slogan [this year] is
'art by you, for you,' "

MacMillan said.
Submission for the event remains open
until March 1 and is widely encouraged by
the committee.
"Any student, staff, or faculty artist is wel
come to be a part of An Art Affair," Cannon
