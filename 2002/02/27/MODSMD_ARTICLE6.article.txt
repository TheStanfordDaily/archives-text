### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Thirteen of the 40 student groups
that applied for $1000 grants from
the Office of the President and
Provost for Stanford's Community
Day, scheduled for April 7, were
named last week.
These groups, along with 15 stu
dent public-service groups and over
20 University departments and orga
nizations, will use the grants to con
struct and plan activities for the day.
Created by organizers to be an
"open house" for neighbors of the
Stanford community, the day will

feature music, tours, art exhibits,
athletic events, faculty lectures, a
children's carnival, research dis
plays, demonstrations and more.
The goal of the event, according
to the Office of ihe President and
Provost, is to "increase understand
ing among Stanford and its neigh
bors, especially the residents of Palo
Alto, Menlo Park, East Palo Alto,
Woodside and Portola Valley."
The 13 groups receiving grants
for the day are the Caribbean Stu
dents Association, Gamma Zeta
Alpha, Men's Ultimate Frisbee, Mus
lim Student Awareness Network,
Stanford African Students Associa
tion, Stanford Astronomical Society,
Stanford Cycling Club, Stanford In
stitute of Electrical and Electronics

Women Engineers, Stanford


STELLA COUSINS/The Stanford Daily
Squash, Stanford Tae kwon do
Club, Stanford Thai-American In
tercultural Society and Stanford
Undergraduate Journal.
According to Community Day
Director Ryan Foley, the groups ap
plied lor the grants in November.
"We looked for student orga
nizations whose members had a
sense of what would be of inter

est to community members and
what would educate and enter
tain kids," Foley said. "We were
really impressed by the quality
of the applications and the inge
nuity of the ideas. We wish we
could have given grants to all 40
applicants."
Community Day take place
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m on April 7.
All events are open to the public
and free. For more information,
