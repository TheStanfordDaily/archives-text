## Branner to be renovated 
### MATT BRICKER 
Imagine being an incoming freshman
again and sitting in Memorial Auditori
um for "Faces." Each dorm has come up
with a different cheer to assert its superi
ority. The energy is high and the atmos
phere is raucous. But only one thing is
missing. As much as you might strain
your ears, you won't hear even a whisper
of the familiar freshman mantra, "Plan
ner sucks! Branner sucks!"
Beginning in September, Branner
will be closed until June 2003 while
undergoing a complete renovation of
its housing and dining facilities. The
Branner facelift marks the end of sev
eral major housing projects that have
occurred over the past two years. It
also marks the beginning of a number
of housing changes coming to campus
over the next few years.
Adding Rooms, Losing Room
fhe remodeling of Mirrielees last
summer and is still only two-thirds
done. The coordination of these build

ing projects — in particular the renova
tion of Branner and the conversion of
Mirrielees to triples — are orchestrated
to work in conjunction with each other.
"It's all part of our Capital Improve
ment Program," said Executive Director
of Student Housing Services Rodger
Whitney. "We planned the Mirrielees
and Branner projects to coincide so that
we minimized the number of beds that
were lost in the process."
Last summer the A- and C-wings of
Mirrielees were converted from doubles
into triples, yielding 100 new beds for
residents. The plan for this summer is to
convert the middle B-wing from dou
bles into triples, opening up an addi
tional 50 new spaces.
"We are shooting for completion by
Labor Day and that shouldn't be a prob
lem," Whitney said. "While none of the
landscaping or exterior work has been
done, we only have one-third of the
rooms to expand this summer."
A Branner Planner
Whitney also answered what he said

was an often-asked question — why will
it take so long to remodel Branner?
"Branner is an old building," Whit
ney said. "It is 80 years old and has a lot
of historic structure. There is a lot of de
ferred maintenance to be done at the
same time as the remodel."
The closing of Branner eliminates
close to 180 beds, leaving a deficit of 30
students without living quarters despite
Mirrielees's new spaces. The additional
problem remains that the 180 lost Bran
ner spaces would have been occupied by
freshmen.
"I don't want students to think that
just because we are redoing Mirrielees
now to help with taking Branner off-line
that we are sticking freshmen in Mir
rielees," Whitney said.
According to Housing Assignments
Manager Todd Benson, freshmen will
be dispersed throughout Wilbur and
Stern, so that each four-class residence
will contain a few more freshmen than
in the past.
"In order to maintain the same
number of all-frosh houses, we
will be converting a four-class
house to an all-frosh house for the
academic year 2002-03," said Di
rector of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo.
This 30 lost spaces created in
the Branner vacuum did not seem
to trouble Whitney or Benson.
"That number won't be hard to
make up," Whitney said. "It fluc
tuates from year to year, and with
aspects such as Overseas Studies
and students stopping out, it
shouldn't be hard to find a place
for those students at all."
Cardinal Commuters
Benson offered some sugges
tions as to how those beds will
be found.
"Certainly Oak Creek and
Sharon Green will be a prima
ry — a significant — source in
finding these spaces next year,"
Benson said.
According to Benson, 200 stu
dents live in off-campus apart
ments, and Stanford makes every
effort to make the situation rela
tively painless.
"We pay for high-speed [ Digital
Subscriber Line] Internet access
and Marguerite service to and
from the complexes," Benson said.
"They are actually cheaper than
some on-campus residences."
Benson added that no stu
dents are placed into either Oak
Creek or Sharon Green unless
they specifically request it during
the Draw.
"If space opens up on campus
later in the year, we will let
[apartment residents] have a
chance to move back on cam
pus," Benson said.
Uncommon Living Spaces
Accommodating students re
turning from overseas study is an
additional chore for Housing

Services.
A waiting-list draw occurs
halfway through the quarter be
fore the students on the waiting
list will be housed. There is also a
walk-on meeting at the start of
each quarter.
"[The meetings are] only for
students not in any University
housing, which includes Oak
Creek and Sharon Green," Ben
son said.
Students are addressed in orig
inal Draw-number order and
placed wherever openings arise.
Both Benson and Whitney
stressed that they will not resort to
previous short-term solutions to
the housing crunch.
"We aren't going to be crowd
ing people in any more," Whitney
said. "We don't like converting
common spaces to rooms and are
trying to pull out of them."
Instead, the University will look
at the square footage of rooms
around campus, especially in Row
houses and determine where a
room could reasonably hold anoth
er student. This will increase the
number of beds on campus without
jeopardizing common spaces or
fairness to students. According to
Benson, it would "just slightly
change the availability of rooms
within some in-house draws."
A relationship exists between
housing services and the Over
seas Studies Program but not a
direct partnership. Jacqueline
Wender, the OSP director, de
scribed the relationship as "colle
gial and appropriate."
" There is no issue of lack of
communication," she said.
Wender made it clear, howev
er, that no one in either housing
or Overseas Studies considers
studying abroad to be a way to re
lieve housing crunches.
"I think it is important to clear
up a basic misconception about
the relationship of Overseas Stud
ies to housing," Wender said.
"Simply put, we want to increase
enrollments because we believe in
the value of study abroad."
Wender said that concern over

housing is one of the factors that
students consider when applying
to study abroad. However, when
compared to academic or athletic
schedule constraints, it is almost a
non-issue.
"In a perfect world, under
standing all logistical problems
and not wishing to create
headaches for anyone, it would be
great for students who go abroad
in the winter to be able to return to
the residence they left in the fall,"
Wender said. "It would also be
nice if students going abroad
could know where they will live
before they return."
Livin' on Levin
Although the University has
mostly worked out its approach
for dealing with next year's
unique housing situation, the
issue of expansion and renovation
is an ongoing process.
"We plan to renovate cluster

one of the Row houses in the sum
mer of 2003," Whitney said. "This
includes Kappa Sig, 680 [Lomita]
and Theta Delt."
Whitney also said that a possi
ble long-range plan would be to
build a house on Levin field —
former location of the tempo
rary post office — which would
add 150 beds. According to
Whitney, there exists "no specif
ic timeline or direct planning"
for the project.
According to Student Housing
Services, the current planning
and coordination going into reno
vations and relocations ensures
that Stanford will continue to
guarantee four years of housing
and handle all housing crunches
in the near future. Although next
year's freshmen will never know
what they are missing by not being
able to chant "Branner sucks,"
they can be thankful that they will
at least have a place to sleep.

mer of 2003," Whitney said. "This
includes Kappa Sig, 680 [Lomita]
and Theta Delt."
Whitney also said that a possi
ble long-range plan would be to
build a house on Levin field —
former location of the tempo
rary post office — which would
add 150 beds. According to
Whitney, there exists "no specif
ic timeline or direct planning"
for the project.
According to Student Housing
Services, the current planning
and coordination going into reno
vations and relocations ensures
that Stanford will continue to
guarantee four years of housing
and handle all housing crunches
in the near future. Although next
year's freshmen will never know
what they are missing by not being
able to chant "Branner sucks,"
they can be thankful that they will
at least have a place to sleep.

The closing of Branner Hall due to renovations will eliminate beds for 180

Imagine being an incoming freshman
again and sitting in Memorial Auditori
um for "Faces." Each dorm has come up
with a different cheer to assert its superi
ority. The energy is high and the atmos
phere is raucous. But only one thing is
missing. As much as you might strain
your ears, you won't hear even a whisper
of the familiar freshman mantra, "Plan
ner sucks! Branner sucks!"
Beginning in September, Branner
will be closed until June 2003 while
undergoing a complete renovation of
its housing and dining facilities. The
Branner facelift marks the end of sev
eral major housing projects that have
occurred over the past two years. It
also marks the beginning of a number
of housing changes coming to campus
over the next few years.
Adding Rooms, Losing Room
fhe remodeling of Mirrielees last
summer and is still only two-thirds
done. The coordination of these build

ing projects — in particular the renova
tion of Branner and the conversion of
Mirrielees to triples — are orchestrated
to work in conjunction with each other.
"It's all part of our Capital Improve
ment Program," said Executive Director
of Student Housing Services Rodger
Whitney. "We planned the Mirrielees
and Branner projects to coincide so that
we minimized the number of beds that
were lost in the process."
Last summer the A- and C-wings of
Mirrielees were converted from doubles
into triples, yielding 100 new beds for
residents. The plan for this summer is to
convert the middle B-wing from dou
bles into triples, opening up an addi
tional 50 new spaces.
"We are shooting for completion by
Labor Day and that shouldn't be a prob
lem," Whitney said. "While none of the
landscaping or exterior work has been
done, we only have one-third of the
rooms to expand this summer."
A Branner Planner
Whitney also answered what he said

was an often-asked question — why will
it take so long to remodel Branner?
"Branner is an old building," Whit
ney said. "It is 80 years old and has a lot
of historic structure. There is a lot of de
ferred maintenance to be done at the
same time as the remodel."
The closing of Branner eliminates
close to 180 beds, leaving a deficit of 30
students without living quarters despite
Mirrielees's new spaces. The additional
problem remains that the 180 lost Bran
ner spaces would have been occupied by
freshmen.
"I don't want students to think that
just because we are redoing Mirrielees
now to help with taking Branner off-line
that we are sticking freshmen in Mir
rielees," Whitney said.
According to Housing Assignments
Manager Todd Benson, freshmen will
be dispersed throughout Wilbur and
Stern, so that each four-class residence
will contain a few more freshmen than
in the past.
"In order to maintain the same
number of all-frosh houses, we
will be converting a four-class
house to an all-frosh house for the
academic year 2002-03," said Di
rector of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo.
This 30 lost spaces created in
the Branner vacuum did not seem
to trouble Whitney or Benson.
"That number won't be hard to
make up," Whitney said. "It fluc
tuates from year to year, and with
aspects such as Overseas Studies
and students stopping out, it
shouldn't be hard to find a place
for those students at all."
Cardinal Commuters
Benson offered some sugges
tions as to how those beds will
be found.
"Certainly Oak Creek and
Sharon Green will be a prima
ry — a significant — source in
finding these spaces next year,"
Benson said.
According to Benson, 200 stu
dents live in off-campus apart
ments, and Stanford makes every
effort to make the situation rela
tively painless.
"We pay for high-speed [ Digital
Subscriber Line] Internet access
and Marguerite service to and
from the complexes," Benson said.
"They are actually cheaper than
some on-campus residences."
Benson added that no stu
dents are placed into either Oak
Creek or Sharon Green unless
they specifically request it during
the Draw.
"If space opens up on campus
later in the year, we will let
[apartment residents] have a
chance to move back on cam
pus," Benson said.
Uncommon Living Spaces
Accommodating students re
turning from overseas study is an
additional chore for Housing

Services.
A waiting-list draw occurs
halfway through the quarter be
fore the students on the waiting
list will be housed. There is also a
walk-on meeting at the start of
each quarter.
"[The meetings are] only for
students not in any University
housing, which includes Oak
Creek and Sharon Green," Ben
son said.
Students are addressed in orig
inal Draw-number order and
placed wherever openings arise.
Both Benson and Whitney
stressed that they will not resort to
previous short-term solutions to
the housing crunch.
"We aren't going to be crowd
ing people in any more," Whitney
said. "We don't like converting
common spaces to rooms and are
trying to pull out of them."
Instead, the University will look
at the square footage of rooms
around campus, especially in Row
houses and determine where a
room could reasonably hold anoth
er student. This will increase the
number of beds on campus without
jeopardizing common spaces or
fairness to students. According to
Benson, it would "just slightly
change the availability of rooms
within some in-house draws."
A relationship exists between
housing services and the Over
seas Studies Program but not a
direct partnership. Jacqueline
Wender, the OSP director, de
scribed the relationship as "colle
gial and appropriate."
" There is no issue of lack of
communication," she said.
Wender made it clear, howev
er, that no one in either housing
or Overseas Studies considers
studying abroad to be a way to re
lieve housing crunches.
"I think it is important to clear
up a basic misconception about
the relationship of Overseas Stud
ies to housing," Wender said.
"Simply put, we want to increase
enrollments because we believe in
the value of study abroad."
Wender said that concern over

housing is one of the factors that
students consider when applying
to study abroad. However, when
compared to academic or athletic
schedule constraints, it is almost a
non-issue.
"In a perfect world, under
standing all logistical problems
and not wishing to create
headaches for anyone, it would be
great for students who go abroad
in the winter to be able to return to
the residence they left in the fall,"
Wender said. "It would also be
nice if students going abroad
could know where they will live
before they return."

the relationship of Overseas Stud
ies to housing," Wender said.
"Simply put, we want to increase
enrollments because we believe in
the value of study abroad."
Wender said that concern over

housing is one of the factors that
students consider when applying
to study abroad. However, when
compared to academic or athletic
schedule constraints, it is almost a
non-issue.
"In a perfect world, under
standing all logistical problems
and not wishing to create
headaches for anyone, it would be
great for students who go abroad
in the winter to be able to return to
the residence they left in the fall,"
Wender said. "It would also be
nice if students going abroad
could know where they will live
before they return."
Livin' on Levin
Although the University has
mostly worked out its approach
for dealing with next year's
unique housing situation, the
issue of expansion and renovation
is an ongoing process.
"We plan to renovate cluster

one of the Row houses in the sum
mer of 2003," Whitney said. "This
includes Kappa Sig, 680 [Lomita]
and Theta Delt."
Whitney also said that a possi
ble long-range plan would be to
build a house on Levin field —
former location of the tempo
rary post office — which would
add 150 beds. According to
Whitney, there exists "no specif
ic timeline or direct planning"
for the project.
According to Student Housing
Services, the current planning
and coordination going into reno
vations and relocations ensures
that Stanford will continue to
guarantee four years of housing
and handle all housing crunches
in the near future. Although next
year's freshmen will never know
what they are missing by not being
able to chant "Branner sucks,"
they can be thankful that they will
at least have a place to sleep.

The closing of Branner Hall due to renovations will eliminate beds for 180
freshman and contribute to the housing crunch. The University plans to ame
liorate the problem by converting more Mirrielees doubles into triples.
