## Branner to be renovated 
### MATT BRICKER 
Imagine being an incoming freshman
again and sitting in Memorial Auditori
um for "Faces." Each dorm has come up
with a different cheer to assert its superi
ority. The energy is high and the atmos
phere is raucous. But only one thing is
missing. As much as you might strain
your ears, you won't hear even a whisper
of the familiar freshman mantra, "Plan
ner sucks! Branner sucks!"
Beginning in September, Branner
will be closed until June 2003 while
undergoing a complete renovation of
its housing and dining facilities. The
Branner facelift marks the end of sev
eral major housing projects that have
occurred over the past two years. It
also marks the beginning of a number
of housing changes coming to campus
over the next few years.
Adding Rooms, Losing Room
fhe remodeling of Mirrielees last
summer and is still only two-thirds
done. The coordination of these build

ing projects — in particular the renova
tion of Branner and the conversion of
Mirrielees to triples — are orchestrated
to work in conjunction with each other.
"It's all part of our Capital Improve
ment Program," said Executive Director
of Student Housing Services Rodger
Whitney. "We planned the Mirrielees
and Branner projects to coincide so that
we minimized the number of beds that
were lost in the process."
Last summer the A- and C-wings of
Mirrielees were converted from doubles
into triples, yielding 100 new beds for
residents. The plan for this summer is to
convert the middle B-wing from dou
bles into triples, opening up an addi
tional 50 new spaces.
"We are shooting for completion by
Labor Day and that shouldn't be a prob
lem," Whitney said. "While none of the
landscaping or exterior work has been
done, we only have one-third of the
rooms to expand this summer."
A Branner Planner
Whitney also answered what he said

was an often-asked question — why will
it take so long to remodel Branner?
"Branner is an old building," Whit
ney said. "It is 80 years old and has a lot
of historic structure. There is a lot of de
ferred maintenance to be done at the
same time as the remodel."
The closing of Branner eliminates
close to 180 beds, leaving a deficit of 30
students without living quarters despite
Mirrielees's new spaces. The additional
problem remains that the 180 lost Bran
ner spaces would have been occupied by
freshmen.
"I don't want students to think that
just because we are redoing Mirrielees
now to help with taking Branner off-line
that we are sticking freshmen in Mir
rielees," Whitney said.
According to Housing Assignments
Manager Todd Benson, freshmen will
be dispersed throughout Wilbur and
Stern, so that each four-class residence
will contain a few more freshmen than
in the past.
