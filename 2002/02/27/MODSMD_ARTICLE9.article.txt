On Feb. 27, 1951, The Daily printed an article
about the staff of UCLA's student newspaper quit
ting in protest to personnel changes.
"The Daily UCLA Bruin died last Friday — after it
had been beaten, compromised, and kicked around
by die Student Executive Council for two months.
"Martin Brower, who had been appointed editor
by the Council early Wednesday evening, resigned
Friday with most of his staff when the SEC appointed
a non-staff member to the position of feature editor.
"The SEC, which wanted to make sure the new
Bruin editor was an 'unbiased' nonentity, voted down
Jerry Schlapik and Brower, the Bruin's first and sec
ond choice for editor, last semester. Schlapik's name
was sent to the Council and approved by Publications
Council three times — and voted down for no stated

reason by the council three times.
"After several midnight sessions, Brower was fi
nally chosen managing editor. Schlapik drifted
along as acting editor this semester until last
Wednesday when the SEC finally voted Brower in.
At the same time the SEC voted down both the Bruin
choices for managing editor.
"In his final editorial, Martin Brower wrote of the
compromises it has taken to keep the Bruin alive for
so many years — of the constant refusals of the SEC
to accept qualified candidates, people with minds of
their own. Brower wrote of his own decision too:
"'... I publicly resigned the editorship with the
statement that over three years of working 30 hours
per week on the Bruin were shot, ft was here, at this
instant, that the entire staff was unified. As I walked
from the Council table they crowded around me,
hugging me, shaking my hands and crying. We were
at this moment once again the staff we had been three
years ago — mostly new faces, but the same spirit, the
same principles....
Bottom Line: "Martin Brower" kind of sounds like "Mark
Boucher."
