A Call for Fair Play: Athletic Apparel at Stanford
In a report issued today by Nike, the athletic-apparel giant confessed to facilitating worker exploita
tion. The study uncovered the exchange of sexual favors for jobs—as well as other physical and verbal
abuses—at factories in Indonesia that inanufacture Nike products."
(Forbes Magazine, Thursday February 22, 2001)
This quote, recorded just over one year ago,
reveals that the problem of sweatshop abuse
is still alive and widespread. From factories
around the world come reports of multiple
workers coughing up blood on assembly
lines, union workers being harassed for
requesting a six day work week, and workers
being fired for telling journalists about vio
lence against workers in the factories; all of
which have come out within the past two
years. In Indonesia, the Urban Community
Mission worked with and surveyed 3,500
workers from 11 different Nike contract fac
tories from September 10th through October
18th 2000. More than 57 percent of the
respondents indicated that they had seen
workers being verbally abused by supervisors.
It was also common that supervisors would
mistreat their workers by pulling their ears,
punching or slapping them.
Despite Nike's decade long history of violating
workers' rights and reports of continued abus
es, Stanford University renewed its multi-mil
lion dollar contract with Nike in 2001.
Stanford defends the contract renewal by
appealing to Nike's commitment to the Fair
Labor Association (FLA) code of conduct.
But while the FLA contends to be an inde
pendent monitor of the working conditions
in its affiliated licensees factories, it has time
and again proven to be an ineffective and
flawed organization. Why? The FLA is an
association organized and funded primarily
by the major apparel corporations them
selves. Corporate representatives, including
one from Nike, sit on the FLA Board of
Directors, which leads to biased practices
and unreliable factory monitoring.
As a non-profit educational institution, it is
necessary that Stanford holds corporate
alliances such as Nike to the same ethical
standards it espouses in the Fundamental
Standard: morality, personal honor, and
most importantly respect for the rights of
others. In order to ensure that we do not
compromise these values, we must have
access to as much information as possible
concerning our corporate alliance's prac
tices. Stanford has not pursued the one
avenue which could provide us with ade
quate information: the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC).
The WRC is a non-profit organization creat
ed by university administrations, students
and labor rights experts whose purpose is to
assist in the enforcement of manufacturing
Codes of Conduct adopted by universities;
these Codes are designed to ensure that fac
tories producing clothing and other goods
bearing university names respect the basic
rights of workers. Currently, there are over
90 universities affiliated with the WRC. A
fundamental distinction between the WRC
and the FLA is that the WRC is not a pup
pet of corporate interests; unlike the FLA,
the WRC does not allow corporate represen
tatives in its governance nor receive any
funding from corporations.
Joining the WRC would not affect our con
tract with Nike. It is not a goal of this cam
paign to initiate a Nike boycott or an anti-
Nike movement. However, we do feel obliged
to take a stand concerning Stanford's absence
from the WRC.
112 student-athletes have already signed a
petition within the past three days. This
petition makes a single request of our uni
versity: Join the Worker Rights Consortium
by the beginning of the 2002-2003 academ
ic year. This issue affects all of us who are
associated with the Gianford name. EVERY
member of the Stanford community can sign
the petition starting this Monday from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. in White Plaza. If you are a
student who is interested in getting more
informed on this issue, or would like to
become more involved, we encourage you to
come to an informational session open to the
whole student body this Sunday afternoon at
2:00 p.m. in the 557 Mayfield lounge.

lion dollar contract with Nike in 2001.
Stanford defends the contract renewal by
appealing to Nike's commitment to the Fair
Labor Association (FLA) code of conduct.
But while the FLA contends to be an inde
pendent monitor of the working conditions
in its affiliated licensees factories, it has time
and again proven to be an ineffective and
flawed organization. Why? The FLA is an
association organized and funded primarily
by the major apparel corporations them
selves. Corporate representatives, including
one from Nike, sit on the FLA Board of
Directors, which leads to biased practices
and unreliable factory monitoring.
As a non-profit educational institution, it is
necessary that Stanford holds corporate
alliances such as Nike to the same ethical
standards it espouses in the Fundamental
Standard: morality, personal honor, and
most importantly respect for the rights of
others. In order to ensure that we do not
compromise these values, we must have
access to as much information as possible
concerning our corporate alliance's prac
tices. Stanford has not pursued the one
avenue which could provide us with ade
quate information: the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC).
The WRC is a non-profit organization creat
ed by university administrations, students
and labor rights experts whose purpose is to
assist in the enforcement of manufacturing
Codes of Conduct adopted by universities;
these Codes are designed to ensure that fac
tories producing clothing and other goods
bearing university names respect the basic
rights of workers. Currently, there are over
90 universities affiliated with the WRC. A
fundamental distinction between the WRC
and the FLA is that the WRC is not a pup
pet of corporate interests; unlike the FLA,
the WRC does not allow corporate represen
tatives in its governance nor receive any
funding from corporations.
Joining the WRC would not affect our con
tract with Nike. It is not a goal of this cam
paign to initiate a Nike boycott or an anti-
Nike movement. However, we do feel obliged
to take a stand concerning Stanford's absence
from the WRC.
112 student-athletes have already signed a
petition within the past three days. This
petition makes a single request of our uni
versity: Join the Worker Rights Consortium
by the beginning of the 2002-2003 academ
ic year. This issue affects all of us who are
associated with the Gianford name. EVERY
member of the Stanford community can sign
the petition starting this Monday from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. in White Plaza. If you are a
student who is interested in getting more
informed on this issue, or would like to
become more involved, we encourage you to
come to an informational session open to the
whole student body this Sunday afternoon at
2:00 p.m. in the 557 Mayfield lounge.
