On Feb. 1, 1 was driving home after
visiting a friend who lives in Redwood
City. The evening had not gone well and
I was anxious to get 1101111'. Between my
distress and taking in the snow dumped
by a storm the prior weekend, my atten
tion was compromised and I hit a large
rock in the road. Considering the cir
cumstances and Murphy's Law, I knew I
was going have a flat tire.
1 was on I Iwy. 35, without a cell phone
and no phone booth nearby. There are
houses up there, but 1 might have to hike
far in the cold to get to one where the occu
pant was home and would make a call for
me. Further, reviewing my itinerary before
leaving home, I had "wisely" decided I
would not need my gloves and heavy coat.
Change it myself? Well, living in Boul
der Creek, I guess I am somewhat of a
"mountain mama," chopping and haul
ing wood and the like, but I doubt I have
the kind of brawn necessary to deal with
those lug nuts. My only hope at that time
was that someone driving by might stop.
Before 1 had a chance to really think
any of these things through, a car going
the opposite direction came around the
bend. I flashed my blights as it went by.
Peering in my rearview mirror I saw it
stop and the backup lights come on. It
swung around and pulled up behind me.
But I wondered with some trepidation
who I had attracted.
When he opened the door and
stepped out I could see that my would-be
rescuer was a young man. With the inte
rior lights on, I saw there was young
woman in the passenger seat. Maybe I II
be okay, I thought. I quickly discovered
this man was a gentleman; a young gen

tleman from Texas currently studying at
Stanford courtesy of the U.S. Air Force.
His name is Marcus Flagg.
Flagg was not familiar with my vehicle
and thus how to remove the spare. This
posed some difficulties but he set to help
ing me anyway. My jack proved inade
quate — after placing it twice — and he
had to use his own. While Flagg was labor
ing, I remembered I had a AAA card. His
friend had offered the use of her cell phone
earlier. Feeling bad about him spending
his Friday night in this manner, 1 suggest
ed this option to him. 1 le declined.
Altogether, it took Flagg about an hour
to complete the task. While he was work
ing, I would ask him questions. Any re
sponse was prefaced by a "Yes, ma'am", or
a "No, ma'am."
There he was, lying in the icy mud in
order to help me. No matter the chal
lenge, he refused to give up and abandon
me. I believe 1 may have even heard a hint
about giving me a ride home if lie were
not successful despite the great distance.
As much as 1 would like, 1 don't be
lieve I can convey the tremendous sense
of relief I experienced when I realized I
was going to be able to get home that
night — with my vehicle.
Flagg not only got me home, but
saved me a big hassle later. Considering
my state of mind, it was all 1 wanted at
the time. And even though I then hit a
deer that had walked right out in front of
me about 5 miles from Boulder Creek, I
did make it home. What a night!
Flagg exemplified some very admiral
traits; lie has clearly moved out of an ego
centric world, takingothers into consider
ation to the degree that he is motivated to
help. I don't see much of that these days.
And 1 believe it is to our detriment.
To me, Flagg represents a time when it

seems people understood that we have to
pull together, work together and help each
other in order to create a healthy commu
nity. As far as I'm concerned, this attitude
is what helped make this nation great. But
it can start small; practicing "community"
can he something as simple as helping a
stranded person with a Hat tire.
Of course there are many good peo
ple and sometimes I think I see im
provement. However, I also see a lot of
"me-centered" activity. We will not build
healthy local, national and world com
munities when individuals care only
about themselves; one cannot live out
side some sort of community.
Flagg is a model of a true, full-fledged
community citizen. And 1 invite every
one to emulate his conduct. Such an atti
tude will help our communities, hut the
real pay off is that it makes us the kind of
people we're suppose to be.

On Feb. 1, 1 was driving home after

Marcus Flagg
On Feb. 1, 1 was driving home after
visiting a friend who lives in Redwood
City. The evening had not gone well and
I was anxious to get 1101111'. Between my
distress and taking in the snow dumped
by a storm the prior weekend, my atten
tion was compromised and I hit a large
rock in the road. Considering the cir
cumstances and Murphy's Law, I knew I
was going have a flat tire.
1 was on I Iwy. 35, without a cell phone
and no phone booth nearby. There are
houses up there, but 1 might have to hike
far in the cold to get to one where the occu
pant was home and would make a call for
me. Further, reviewing my itinerary before
leaving home, I had "wisely" decided I
would not need my gloves and heavy coat.
Change it myself? Well, living in Boul
der Creek, I guess I am somewhat of a
"mountain mama," chopping and haul
ing wood and the like, but I doubt I have
the kind of brawn necessary to deal with
those lug nuts. My only hope at that time
was that someone driving by might stop.
Before 1 had a chance to really think
any of these things through, a car going
the opposite direction came around the
bend. I flashed my blights as it went by.
Peering in my rearview mirror I saw it
stop and the backup lights come on. It
swung around and pulled up behind me.
But I wondered with some trepidation
who I had attracted.
When he opened the door and
stepped out I could see that my would-be
rescuer was a young man. With the inte
rior lights on, I saw there was young
woman in the passenger seat. Maybe I II
be okay, I thought. I quickly discovered
this man was a gentleman; a young gen

tleman from Texas currently studying at
Stanford courtesy of the U.S. Air Force.
His name is Marcus Flagg.
Flagg was not familiar with my vehicle
and thus how to remove the spare. This
posed some difficulties but he set to help
ing me anyway. My jack proved inade
quate — after placing it twice — and he
had to use his own. While Flagg was labor
ing, I remembered I had a AAA card. His
friend had offered the use of her cell phone
earlier. Feeling bad about him spending
his Friday night in this manner, 1 suggest
ed this option to him. 1 le declined.
Altogether, it took Flagg about an hour
to complete the task. While he was work
ing, I would ask him questions. Any re
sponse was prefaced by a "Yes, ma'am", or
a "No, ma'am."
There he was, lying in the icy mud in
order to help me. No matter the chal
lenge, he refused to give up and abandon
me. I believe 1 may have even heard a hint
about giving me a ride home if lie were
not successful despite the great distance.
As much as 1 would like, 1 don't be
lieve I can convey the tremendous sense
of relief I experienced when I realized I
was going to be able to get home that
night — with my vehicle.
Flagg not only got me home, but
saved me a big hassle later. Considering
my state of mind, it was all 1 wanted at
the time. And even though I then hit a
deer that had walked right out in front of
me about 5 miles from Boulder Creek, I
did make it home. What a night!
