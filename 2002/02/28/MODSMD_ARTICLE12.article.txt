## Gymnasts heat up for Beavers 
### SARAH LINDSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hardly anyone will argue with
the old sports adage that there are
few things more vital to a success
fill season than peaking at just the
right time.
Last Friday's 195.750-191.700
win over California (5-5, 1-5 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) gave good evi
dence that the No. 8 Stanford
women's gymnastics team (7-3, 4-
1) is starting to peak. And with only

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

Friday: No. 8 Stanford de

two more meets until the Pac-10
Championships, it's safe to say that
the Cardinal is peaking at just the
right time.
Whatever doubts might remain

should he put to rest tomorrow as
Stanford travels to No. 16 Oregon
State (5-4, 3-2) for its next-to-last
regular season contest.
"As we head into the home
stretch, it's obvious that our skill
level is competitive with anyone
out there," said head coach Kris
ten Smyth.
Most gymnastic meets are won
or lost by a couple tenths of a point.
But after the bars and vault alone
at Burnham Pavilion on Friday,
Stanford was beating Cal 98.2-
95.4, giving it a lead of almost
three whole points.
Despite an excitable crowd of
Cal fans, Stanford's energy level
remained high, and the Golden
Bears' frustration became more
apparent as the night wore on.
The highlight of the evening
for Stanford was the vault.
Sophomores Kendall Beck and
Shelly Goldberg each scored a
9.9, while freshman Mancly Del
gado added to the excitement,
posting a 9.85.
Goldberg's vault was perfect;
clue to the degree of difficulty, a
9.9 was the highest she could pos
sibly score.
"On the vault, everyone was ag
gressive and the landings were ex
cellent," said senior Becky Mel
drum.
The impressive lead from the
first rotation was strengthened
after the Cardinal competed on
the beam. So even with a shaky
performance on the floor exercise,
Stanford was able to fall back on its
large cushion to still come away
with a big victory.
"We started off great on vault,
and pretty much continued the
trend until we hit floor where we
just fizzled," Meldrum said. "I am
not too worried about it, however.
It seems that we have always had
about one home meet per season in
which floor is a little scary. I am con
fident that it will not happen again."
Stanford will look to learn from
and move past such little mistakes
at Oregon State tomorrow.
The Cardinal has won its last
three meetings with the Beavers,
who split their meets last weekend.
Oregon State defeated Cal State-
Fullerton, 194.400-193.950, on
Friday before dropping a 197.550-
194.925 decision to Pac-10 leader
No. 6 UCLA on Sunday.
