### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After Saturday's loss to No. 1 1 California that
snapped a 21-match string of victories against the
Bears and a 75-match home winning streak, the
No. 3 Stanford men's tennis team needed several
easy clays of confidence-building practice to rest
and unwind.
This practice, coming in the form of matches
against unranked Utah and Santa Clara, was slight
ly easier than expected.
On Monday, Stanford (9-1) destroyed Utah (5-
5), 6-1, at the Taube Family Tennis Center.
The Cardinal captured the doubles point after
all three teams posted easy victories.
The team of junior Ryan Haviland and senior
K.J. Hippensteel, ranked ninth in the country,
bounced back from their surprising 8-6 loss last
weekend, dominating their opponents, 8-3. The
No. 2 team of juniors Scott Lipsky and David Mar
tin handled their opponents 8-4, while the fresh
man duo of Phil Sheng and Sam Warburg outlast
ed their opponents, 8-0.
If the doubles scores seemed skewed, then the
singles games were a veritable slaughter. Five oft he
six matchups were dominated by Stanford players

in straight sets.
Hippensteel, the nation's top-ranked player, re
deemed himself after falling to John Paul Fruttero
of Cal last week with a 6-0, 6-3 mauling of the Utes'
top player, David Mercier.
No. 16 Martin, Sheng, Warburg and sophomore
Joe Kao added to the Cardinal avalanche, each win
ning without ever dropping more than four games
in a set.
The only surprise came as No. 37 Ryan 1 laviland
came up short in a surprising straight-set loss to
Corrie Sheepers, 7-5, 6-3.
The next clay, the Cardinal squad headed back
to Taube for another afternoon of tennis, this time
against Santa Clara (3-5).
The battle of Highway 101 schools ended in an
even bigger rout as Stanford utterly dominated the
Broncos 7-0 with all straight-set victories.
The win came after the team's lineup was shuf
fled, giving Hippensteel a day off from play. Mar
tin, in his first start at No. 1 singles, defeated Chris
Lam, 7-6, 6-2. Ryan Haviland, in his second start
at No. 2. outplayed the Broncos' Michael Duong,
6-3,6-4.
Doubles proved to be slightly more exciting as
two of the Bronco teams played well to keep up with
the Cardinal.
Playing No. 3 doubles, Sheng and Warburg saw
a 7-3 lead over the team of Victor Camargo and
Federico Mattioli vanish as the Santa Clara players
took three straight games. The Stanford team was
able to close out the game, 8-6, on Sheng's power
ful service winner.
Haviland and Kao played to a 4-4 standstill
against Erich Chen and Rick Ruso before they were
able to pull away for an 8-5 win.
The team takes a break from dual meets until
next week as it travels to the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships tomorrow. The tournament,
which goes through Sunday, pits doubles teams
from West Coast schools against each other in a
seeded draw.
Last year, the current top Cardinal team of Scott
and Martin reached the third round.
New team rankings released yesterday dropped
Stanford from No. 1 to No. 3 in the nation behind
Illinois and Georgia. Cal, impressive in Saturday's
upset, moved up to from No. 18 to No. 11 for its
highest ranking of the year. Despite the shuffling at
the top of the list, the schools represented in the top
10 remain unchanged.
Stanford will return to Taube Tennis Center on
March 8 and 9 against Arizona and Arizona State.

ning without ever dropping more than four games
in a set.
The only surprise came as No. 37 Ryan 1 laviland
came up short in a surprising straight-set loss to
Corrie Sheepers, 7-5, 6-3.
The next clay, the Cardinal squad headed back
to Taube for another afternoon of tennis, this time
against Santa Clara (3-5).
The battle of Highway 101 schools ended in an
even bigger rout as Stanford utterly dominated the
Broncos 7-0 with all straight-set victories.
The win came after the team's lineup was shuf
fled, giving Hippensteel a day off from play. Mar
tin, in his first start at No. 1 singles, defeated Chris
Lam, 7-6, 6-2. Ryan Haviland, in his second start
at No. 2. outplayed the Broncos' Michael Duong,
6-3,6-4.
Doubles proved to be slightly more exciting as
two of the Bronco teams played well to keep up with
the Cardinal.
Playing No. 3 doubles, Sheng and Warburg saw
a 7-3 lead over the team of Victor Camargo and
Federico Mattioli vanish as the Santa Clara players
took three straight games. The Stanford team was
able to close out the game, 8-6, on Sheng's power
ful service winner.
Haviland and Kao played to a 4-4 standstill
against Erich Chen and Rick Ruso before they were
able to pull away for an 8-5 win.
The team takes a break from dual meets until
next week as it travels to the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships tomorrow. The tournament,
which goes through Sunday, pits doubles teams
from West Coast schools against each other in a
seeded draw.
Last year, the current top Cardinal team of Scott
and Martin reached the third round.
New team rankings released yesterday dropped
Stanford from No. 1 to No. 3 in the nation behind
Illinois and Georgia. Cal, impressive in Saturday's
upset, moved up to from No. 18 to No. 11 for its
highest ranking of the year. Despite the shuffling at
the top of the list, the schools represented in the top
10 remain unchanged.
Stanford will return to Taube Tennis Center on
March 8 and 9 against Arizona and Arizona State.
