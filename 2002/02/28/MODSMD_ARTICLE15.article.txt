SPORTS NOTEBOOK

Schroeder surprised many at
the championships by edging out
266 other collegiate rowers while
also finishing ahead of all of the
elite international rowers expect
ed to make a run at the title.
Schroeder finished over four sec
onds ahead of the second-fastest
collegiate rower.
Schroeder was one of three
Cardinal rowers to make the trip
to Boston, as both the Cardinal's
men's and women's crew teams
gear up for their spring seasons,
which begin at the end of March
during spring break.
Senior Sabrina Kolker and
freshman Susan BeVille, both
members of Stanford's women's
crew teams, also made strong
showings at the championships.
Kolker won the collegiate event
and placed fifth in the women's
open event with a time of 6:42.80.
BeVille overcame a case of strep
throat to turn in a time of 7:19.70,
good enough for third in the colle
giate division and 12th in the in

ternational division of the
women's lightweight competition.
OLYMPICS
Sami Jo Small, who graduated
from Stanford in 1999 with a
bachelor's in mechanical engi
neering, picked up a gold medal
at the Salt Lake City Olympics as
the Canadian women's ice hock
ey team's backup goalie.
Small picked up a shutout in
her only appearance at Salt Lake,
as she made six saves in Canada's
7-0 blanking of Russia in prelimi
nary-round action. Kim St. Pierre
started in goal in Canada's five
other games at the Olympics, in
cluding the Canadians' 3-2 win
over the U.S. in the gold medal
game last Thursday.
The gold medal from Salt Lake
added to Small's already-impres
sive set of hardware from her in
volvement with the Canadian Na
tional Team. Small started in goal
for Canada in the finals of the 1999
and the 2000 World Champi
onships, leading the Canadians to
victories over the U.S. in both con
tests while earning M V I' honors in
both tournaments. Small was also a
member of the Canadians' 2001
World Champion squad as well.
Small was the Canadians' third
string goalie at the Nagano games
during her junior year at Stanford
in 1998 but never suited up for any
games. The Canadians look the sil
ver that year.
Small came to Stanford on a
track and field scholarship and ex
pected to compete in the discuss
and the javelin before a shoulder
