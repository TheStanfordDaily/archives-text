# Cardinal heads for the Beach
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
It would seem that the four-match homestand the
No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball just wrapped up was
a resounding success.
A 3-1 record, plus a win over a No. 1 team a week
end ago, plus a near second win over a top-ranked
team this past weekend.
That would seem to add up to a solid homestand.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

Friday: No. 7 Stanford vs. No. 10 Long Beach
State, 7:30 p.m., Long Beach, Calif.

Despite posting a big upset over No. 1 UCLA on
Feb. 16 and narrowly tailing in live games to then-No.
1 Pepperdine this past weekend, the Stanford men
still feel like they have a lot to prove. '
And they will start making their case tomorrow,
heading south to face No. 10 Long Beach State (7-9,
5-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) fora key con
ference matchup.
"V'ou can never be satisfied splitting at home," said
junior libero Seth Ring. "You have to defend the
home court. We had a great crowd, so coming up
short against Pepperdine left a bitter taste with us."
The Cardinal is continuing its recovery from a five
match l<>sing streak earlier this month that left the squad
with a lot of ground to make up in the conference stand
ings. And with 10 of the nation's top 15 teams residing
in the MPSF, making up that ground by no means
seems like an easy, let alone even possible, task.
But Stanford has been taking it one match at a time
as it seeks to lind the consistency that led the team to
a blistering 5-1 start to the season.
The Cardinal is certainly doing everything it needs
to on the offensive end.
Stanford's .358 hitting percentage and 16.6 kills
per game lead the MPSF in conference play.
Junior opposite Curt Toppel and redshirt fresh
man setter Kevin Hansen continue to work incredibly
well together. Toppel pic ked up 31 kills in Stanford's
loss to the Waves on Friday while Hansen picked up a
career-high 76 assists.
Toppel leads the conference with 5.45 kills per
game and will again be the recipient of the lion's share
of Hansen's sets this weekend.
Defense is where Stanford continues to improve
and will need to shore up even more to make the
squad's post-season aspirations a reality.
Fhe Cardinal is only narrowly outdigging its op
ponents on the season and does not have any of its
regular starters averaging over one block per game.
The 49ers present the Cardinal with the kind of

test the squad could use as a benchmark to measure
its development. ()n paper it seems like Stanford ought
to win, but rarely do oughts hold up in the MPSF.
"It's still early to call this a must-win match," said
Ring. "They're lighting fora playoff spot. If we see
ourselves contending fora national title, this is the
type of match we need to win."
