A panel discussion Tuesday night at Tresidder
Union Oak Lounge probed issues relevant to the
"post-post-Cold War world." Sponsored by the
Society for International Affairs at Stanford, the
five-member panel consisted of Stanford profes
sors whose areas of expertise focused on different
parts of the world.
1 his was the society's first major event since it
became an official Stanford organization at the
beginning of the school year.
"We wanted to promote awareness for inter
national affairs," sophomore Tracy Williams, the
coordinator of the event, said. "It was time to
allow people to express their thoughts."
David Holloway, a professor of political science
and history, gave his perspective on Russia.
"Moscow looks at the post-post-Cold War
world with a mixture of uncertainty, a sense of

"In light of the post-[Sept. 11] world, Russia will
strengthen its relations with the United States."
According to Holloway, the main goal of Russ

are not part of the world to [the sense that] you
are [a part of the world] is a big, big move."
He focused on his area of expertise, Africa.
"Somalia is a classic example of a failed state,"
Abernethy said. "There is concern that Somalia
could be the next Afghanistan."
Visiting History Prof. Roger Thompson gave
his input on the discussion's topic.
"Post-post-cold war world — how many 'posts'
can we add until we get tired of it?" Thompson
said. "Perhaps we should be comfortable with a
world without labels."
Thompson discussed relations between China
and the United States.
"[There is] an attempt to reach China as an ally
and an equal."
Middle Eastern History Prof. Ahmad Dallal
