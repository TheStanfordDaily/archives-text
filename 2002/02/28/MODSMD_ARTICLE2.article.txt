### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel discussion Tuesday night at Tresidder
Union Oak Lounge probed issues relevant to the
"post-post-Cold War world." Sponsored by the
Society for International Affairs at Stanford, the
five-member panel consisted of Stanford profes
sors whose areas of expertise focused on different
parts of the world.
1 his was the society's first major event since it
became an official Stanford organization at the
beginning of the school year.
"We wanted to promote awareness for inter
national affairs," sophomore Tracy Williams, the
coordinator of the event, said. "It was time to
allow people to express their thoughts."
David Holloway, a professor of political science
and history, gave his perspective on Russia.
"Moscow looks at the post-post-Cold War
world with a mixture of uncertainty, a sense of
opportunity and apprehension," Holloway said.
"In light of the post-[Sept. 11] world, Russia will
strengthen its relations with the United States."
According to Holloway, the main goal of Russ
ian President Vladimir Putin's administration
will be the modernization of the stale.
Eastern European Studies Prof. Norman
Naimark also gave his insights.
"We don't know where we are or where we are
heading," Naimark said.
Naimark further elaborated on the current
state of Europe. •
"[ There is a] serious labor shortage in Eu
rope," Naimark said. "'They are going to have to
find workers someplace else."
An influx of immigrant workers into various
European countries is one possible outcome of
the labor shortage, according to Naimark.
"[Sept. 11J represents an aspect of globaliza
tion in the sense that the United States actually

joined the world," Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy said. "Going from the sense that you
are not part of the world to [the sense that] you
are [a part of the world] is a big, big move."
He focused on his area of expertise, Africa.
"Somalia is a classic example of a failed state,"
Abernethy said. "There is concern that Somalia
could be the next Afghanistan."
Visiting History Prof. Roger Thompson gave
his input on the discussion's topic.
"Post-post-cold war world — how many 'posts'
can we add until we get tired of it?" Thompson
said. "Perhaps we should be comfortable with a
world without labels."
Thompson discussed relations between China
and the United States.
"[There is] an attempt to reach China as an ally
and an equal."
Middle Eastern History Prof. Ahmad Dallal
gave his views on the Middle East.
"There are many problems in the Middle East,
as in all of the world," Dallal said. "American for-

According to Dallal, one of
root causes of religious extrem
ism is poverty, which is a produt i
of political corruption, monar
chies and military dictatorships.
The panel compared the cur
rent military buildup to that fol
lowing World War If.
"I still don't see where we are
going, what the need for this mil
itary build-up is," Naimark said*
"I see the situation [as] much

more fluid, much more diilicult
to define."
According to Holloway, the
military strength ol the United
Slates matches the strength of
the next eight strongest nations
combined.
"By some estimates, the Unit
ed Slates is responsible for about
40 percent of the world's military
spending," Dallal said.
Students had their own per
sonal insights on the subject.
