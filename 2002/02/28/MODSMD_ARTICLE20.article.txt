# Do-or-die in desert for tourney hopes
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For almost a week, the cliches
have rolled off the tongues of al
most every Stanford coach, every
Stanford player, every popcorn
vendor and every maintenance
man:

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Tonight: No. 17 Stanford vs.
No. 14 Arizona, 7:30 p.m.,
Tucson, Ariz.
Saturday: No. 17 Stanford
vs. Arizona State, 3:00 p.m.,
Tempe, Ariz.

"Forget about last week."
"Don't think about the past."
"Look ahead, not behind."
They're all obvious solutions for
helping the Cardinal recover from
two devastating home losses. Yet
one player — the team's senior co
captain — wasn't avoiding the
past. In fact, he was welcoming it.
"We have to look back upon the
foundation that we've made for
ourselves," Tony Giovacchini said.
"We've beaten UCLA, we've beaten
Oregon, we've been up 15 points
against Arizona at home and we
were up 13 at USC. We're good
enough to beat anyone in this
league and anyone in this country."
Giovacchini's point is one that
the No. 17 Cardinal (17-8, 10-6

Pacific 10 Conference) must not
forget when it travels to the desert
for critical games against No. 14
Arizona tonight and Arizona State
on Saturday. According to the
starting point guard, the ground
work was built long before the de
feats to the Los Angeles schools,
and it should be strong enough to
withstand any disappointment.
When Stanford enters its final
two-game series of the regular
season, the players will have to re
mind themselves of the progress
they have made since the first con
test in November.
"We have a choice as to what we
want to focus on," Giovacchini
said. "How we react to last week's
situation is going to be really im
portant. If we understand the na
ture of our league and the nature
of college basketball in general,
we'll be fine."
Everyone on Stanford's team
had been eagerly anticipating this
two-game set anyway. The players
knew that this series was going to
be important — albeit fora much
different reason.
"We always expected that we
would need to win these games to
win (he Pac-10," junior swingman
Casey Jacobsen said. "But the sig
nificance of the games doesn't
change. It's pretty similar because
these are still must-win games."

The powerful Stanford offense will be without scoring machine Lindsay Ya
masaki when the Cardinal takes to the floor as the No. 1 seed in the Pac-10
Tournament in Eugene, Ore.
Jacobsen is right. If the Cardi
nal fails to win either game, then
Stanford will have one more
chance to end the season on a
bright note at the Pac-10 Tourna
ment in Los Angeles. Lose two in
Arizona and again in the first
round at Staples Center, and the
Cardinal will be a bona fide NCAA
Tournament bubble team with a
season-ending 0-5 record.
One victory will give the Cardi
nal its 18th total victory and its
11th conference victory. Accord
ing to the San Jose Mercury News,
the last 29 teams with that particu
lar combination of regular season
and conference victories have re
ceived bids to the Big Dance.
"If we don't make it, it would be
a devastating situation, and 1 will do
everything I can so that we're not in
that situation," Jacobsen said.
It's not just going to come
clown to Jacobsen, though. He
wasn't the only one who missed
his share of 3-pointers in the
UCIAI game last Saturday, when
the Cardinal set school records for
3-point attempts (42) and missed
H-pointers (28).
Junior guard Julius Barnes
missed 11. Freshman wingman
Josh Childress missed four. Gio
vacchini missed three and sopho
more forward Teyo Johnson

missed two. In coach Mike Mont
gomery's words, the poor shoot
ing was contagious.
And with junior forward Justin
Davis sidelined for at least Thurs
day's game with a bruised rib, the
Cardinal will rely more heavily on
junior center Curtis Borchardt to
post up inside the key.
"We need to get our confidence
back and that confidence comes
from your team's mental and
physical makeup and having some
shots go in along the way," Mont
gomery said. "Right now we're
playing tough top-20 teams who
are taking away our strengths.
That's not the best way to try and
get your confidence back."
Fhe Cardinal will be facing a
Wildcats team that had three play
ers — junior forward Luke Wal
ton, freshman center Channing
Frye and senior point guard Jason
Gardner — score 20 or more
points in Stanford's 88-82 loss at
Maples Pavilion at the beginning
of the month.
To emphasize how much one
game can change the perspective
of a coach, when Montgomery was
asked before the first game
whether he felt confident with
Stanford's defense against Ari
zona, he responded, "We
shouldn't have a problem
matchup-wise. We'll be fine."
The same was asked this week.
Montgomery's response:
" They pose matchup problems
for our guys."

"We need to get our confidence
back and that confidence comes
from your team's mental and
physical makeup and having some
shots go in along the way," Mont
gomery said. "Right now we're
playing tough top-20 teams who
are taking away our strengths.
That's not the best way to try and
get your confidence back."
Fhe Cardinal will be facing a
Wildcats team that had three play
ers — junior forward Luke Wal
ton, freshman center Channing
Frye and senior point guard Jason
Gardner — score 20 or more
points in Stanford's 88-82 loss at
Maples Pavilion at the beginning
of the month.
To emphasize how much one
game can change the perspective
of a coach, when Montgomery was
asked before the first game
whether he felt confident with
Stanford's defense against Ari
zona, he responded, "We
shouldn't have a problem
matchup-wise. We'll be fine."
The same was asked this week.
Montgomery's response:
" They pose matchup problems
for our guys."
For almost a week, the cliches
have rolled off the tongues of al
most every Stanford coach, every
Stanford player, every popcorn
vendor and every maintenance
man:

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Tonight: No. 17 Stanford vs.
No. 14 Arizona, 7:30 p.m.,
Tucson, Ariz.
Saturday: No. 17 Stanford
vs. Arizona State, 3:00 p.m.,
Tempe, Ariz.

"Forget about last week."
"Don't think about the past."
"Look ahead, not behind."
They're all obvious solutions for
helping the Cardinal recover from
two devastating home losses. Yet
one player — the team's senior co
captain — wasn't avoiding the
past. In fact, he was welcoming it.
"We have to look back upon the
foundation that we've made for
ourselves," Tony Giovacchini said.
"We've beaten UCLA, we've beaten
Oregon, we've been up 15 points
against Arizona at home and we
were up 13 at USC. We're good
enough to beat anyone in this
league and anyone in this country."
Giovacchini's point is one that
the No. 17 Cardinal (17-8, 10-6

Pacific 10 Conference) must not
forget when it travels to the desert
for critical games against No. 14
Arizona tonight and Arizona State
on Saturday. According to the
starting point guard, the ground
work was built long before the de
feats to the Los Angeles schools,
and it should be strong enough to
withstand any disappointment.
When Stanford enters its final
two-game series of the regular
season, the players will have to re
mind themselves of the progress
they have made since the first con
test in November.
"We have a choice as to what we
want to focus on," Giovacchini
said. "How we react to last week's
situation is going to be really im
portant. If we understand the na
ture of our league and the nature
of college basketball in general,
we'll be fine."
Everyone on Stanford's team
had been eagerly anticipating this
two-game set anyway. The players
knew that this series was going to
be important — albeit fora much
different reason.
"We always expected that we
would need to win these games to
win (he Pac-10," junior swingman
Casey Jacobsen said. "But the sig
nificance of the games doesn't
change. It's pretty similar because
these are still must-win games."

The powerful Stanford offense will be without scoring machine Lindsay Ya
masaki when the Cardinal takes to the floor as the No. 1 seed in the Pac-10
Tournament in Eugene, Ore.
Jacobsen is right. If the Cardi
nal fails to win either game, then
Stanford will have one more
chance to end the season on a
bright note at the Pac-10 Tourna
ment in Los Angeles. Lose two in
Arizona and again in the first
round at Staples Center, and the
Cardinal will be a bona fide NCAA
Tournament bubble team with a
season-ending 0-5 record.
One victory will give the Cardi
nal its 18th total victory and its
11th conference victory. Accord
ing to the San Jose Mercury News,
the last 29 teams with that particu
lar combination of regular season
and conference victories have re
ceived bids to the Big Dance.
"If we don't make it, it would be
a devastating situation, and 1 will do
everything I can so that we're not in
that situation," Jacobsen said.
It's not just going to come
clown to Jacobsen, though. He
wasn't the only one who missed
his share of 3-pointers in the
UCIAI game last Saturday, when
the Cardinal set school records for
3-point attempts (42) and missed
H-pointers (28).
Junior guard Julius Barnes
missed 11. Freshman wingman
Josh Childress missed four. Gio
vacchini missed three and sopho
more forward Teyo Johnson

missed two. In coach Mike Mont
gomery's words, the poor shoot
ing was contagious.
And with junior forward Justin
Davis sidelined for at least Thurs
day's game with a bruised rib, the
Cardinal will rely more heavily on
junior center Curtis Borchardt to
post up inside the key.

back and that confidence comes
