# Do-or-die in desert for tourney hopes

### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For almost a week, the cliches
have rolled off the tongues of al
most every Stanford coach, every
Stanford player, every popcorn
vendor and every maintenance
man:

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Tonight: No. 17 Stanford vs.
No. 14 Arizona, 7:30 p.m.,
Tucson, Ariz.
Saturday: No. 17 Stanford
vs. Arizona State, 3:00 p.m.,
Tempe, Ariz.

"Forget about last week."
"Don't think about the past."
"Look ahead, not behind."
They're all obvious solutions for
helping the Cardinal recover from
two devastating home losses. Yet
one player — the team's senior co
captain — wasn't avoiding the
past. In fact, he was welcoming it.
"We have to look back upon the
foundation that we've made for
ourselves," Tony Giovacchini said.
"We've beaten UCLA, we've beaten
Oregon, we've been up 15 points
against Arizona at home and we
were up 13 at USC. We're good
enough to beat anyone in this
league and anyone in this country."
Giovacchini's point is one that
the No. 17 Cardinal (17-8, 10-6

Pacific 10 Conference) must not
forget when it travels to the desert
for critical games against No. 14
Arizona tonight and Arizona State
on Saturday. According to the
starting point guard, the ground
work was built long before the de
feats to the Los Angeles schools,
and it should be strong enough to
withstand any disappointment.
When Stanford enters its final
two-game series of the regular
season, the players will have to re
mind themselves of the progress
they have made since the first con
test in November.
"We have a choice as to what we
want to focus on," Giovacchini
said. "How we react to last week's
situation is going to be really im
portant. If we understand the na
ture of our league and the nature
of college basketball in general,
we'll be fine."
Everyone on Stanford's team
had been eagerly anticipating this
two-game set anyway. The players
knew that this series was going to
be important — albeit fora much
different reason.
"We always expected that we
would need to win these games to
win (he Pac-10," junior swingman
Casey Jacobsen said. "But the sig
nificance of the games doesn't
change. It's pretty similar because
these are still must-win games."
