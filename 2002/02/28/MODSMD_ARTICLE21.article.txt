Thanks to the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's decision to bow to the
Almighty Dollar, Stanford's perfect
record might end up as nothing
more than a footnote in next year's

Saturday-Monday: No. 2
Stanford competes at Pac-10
Tournament, tugene, Ore.

With the conference joining
the ranks of others around the
nation in holding a season-end
ing tournament to decide its offi
cial champion, the Cardinal's 18-
0 mark has earned it nothing
more than a No. 1 seed and first
ronnd bye when the first Pac-10
Tournament kicks off this Satur
day in Eugene, Ore.
Making matters worse, the team
will have to play in the tournament
without starting guard Lindsey Ya
masaki, who be out after undergo
ing a laproscopic appendectomy.
"This is a challenge for our
team," said Stanford basketball
head coachTara VanDerveer. "It's
nothing we can control. We just
want to get Lindsey back to 100
percent."
Yamasaki is currently leading
the team in scoring, averaging 17.4
points per game and also adds in

valuable senior leadership on the
court. She ended the regular sea
son with a 33-point performance
against UCIA.
The senior is expected to rejoin
the team for the first round of the
NCAA tournament on March 14 or
15. If Stanford wins the Pac-10
tournament, the team will almost
undoubtedly get a No. 1 seed in the
Big Dance and the opportunity to
host the first two rounds at Maples
Pavilion.
In Yamasaki's absence this
weekend, the Cardinal will need its
deep bench to step up to the occa
sion. Freshman guard Sebnem
Kimyacioglu has been playing well
in conference action, shooting near
50 percent from beyond the arc.
Seniors Enjoli Izidor and Lau
ren St. Clair also boast valuable ex
perience on the wings, and will
have to pick up the pace off the
bench.
Not only must the bench players
step up to fill the hole left by Ya
masaki's absence, but the four
other starters must also play well.
Sophomore guard / forward
Nicole Powell finished the regular
season strong, scoring 36 points
against Southern California on Fri
day. Powell or Yamasaki have been
the leading scorer in 23 of the
team's 29 games this season, and
without Yamasaki's presence on
