Nicole Powell is good.
Unequivocally, undeniably, and in
disputably good.
"Nicole's a great player," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer earlier this sea
son. "She knows it, I know it and you

vision are my greatest strengths," Powell
said. "I've really been able to take ad
vantage of the matchups. Everyone [on
the team] is good about taking advan
tage of their own skills."
