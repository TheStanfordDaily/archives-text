# Watching Nicole Powell on the court is
## Simply "Magic"-al 
### 
Pac-10 Tournament this weekend
without leading scorer Lindsey Ya
masaki, who underwent a laproscopic
appendectomy on Tuesday, the Car
dinal will rely more heavily than usual
on Powell's considerable talent and
court llexibility.
However, Powell's athleticism only
begins to define her as a player.
On a team that has demonstrated re
markable success and depth, she has
emerged as one of Stanford's leaders.
"I lead by example," Powell said. "On
the court, especially playing point guard,
I think my job is to make other people
look good and keep the floor organized.
I'm not really a vocal leader, but 1 try to
work hard and set a good example."
Case in point: last week against USC,
Stanford found itself in the unfamiliar
position of being down, 36-28, at the
half. With Powell taking charge, she sin
gle-handedly matched the Trojans' sec
ond-half output of 24 points as the Car
dinal pushed the game to a level far out
of (JSC's reach.
"1 really challenged them at the half,"
said VanDerveer. "Nicole really stepped
up as a leader."
Her determination to play well and
win motivates her team. With a big
three, a fantastic assist, or a steal in tran
sition, Powell helps raise the Cardinal's
level of play.
Like all great players, Powell plays
with the enthusiasm of one who lives,
breathes and dies basketball.
"I love to play," laughed Powell. "It
doesn't matter — it could be in the open
gym on a Sunday night in the middle of
winter and 1 will be there. I just have so
much fun with the game."
It shows in her smiles and cheers
after she nails a big 3-pointer — or after
she witnesses one of her teammates do
the same.
"Chemistry makes a big difference
and I think that's a big part of why we're
doing better," said Powell. "The chem
istry really is better and you can see it out
there — everyone's having a good time
and no one can take that away from us.
No matter what five are out there, we're
all playing for each other and it's your
teammates that really make [the season]


JOY LEE/The Stanford Daily
It's only taken two years under Tara VanDerveer's tutelage for sophomore guard / forward Nicole Powell to blossom into one of the
country's most talented players. With Stanford's deepest squad in years surrounding her, Powell may lead the Cardinal to its first na
tional championship since 1992.
