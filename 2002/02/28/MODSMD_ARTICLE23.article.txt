# Watching Nicole Powell on the court is
## Simply "Magic"-al 
### 
Pac-10 Tournament this weekend
without leading scorer Lindsey Ya
masaki, who underwent a laproscopic
appendectomy on Tuesday, the Car
dinal will rely more heavily than usual
on Powell's considerable talent and
court llexibility.
However, Powell's athleticism only
begins to define her as a player.
On a team that has demonstrated re
markable success and depth, she has
emerged as one of Stanford's leaders.
"I lead by example," Powell said. "On
the court, especially playing point guard,
I think my job is to make other people
look good and keep the floor organized.
I'm not really a vocal leader, but 1 try to
work hard and set a good example."
Case in point: last week against USC,
Stanford found itself in the unfamiliar
position of being down, 36-28, at the
half. With Powell taking charge, she sin
gle-handedly matched the Trojans' sec
ond-half output of 24 points as the Car
dinal pushed the game to a level far out
of (JSC's reach.
"1 really challenged them at the half,"
said VanDerveer. "Nicole really stepped
up as a leader."
Her determination to play well and
win motivates her team. With a big
three, a fantastic assist, or a steal in tran
sition, Powell helps raise the Cardinal's
level of play.
Like all great players, Powell plays
with the enthusiasm of one who lives,
breathes and dies basketball.
"I love to play," laughed Powell. "It
doesn't matter — it could be in the open
gym on a Sunday night in the middle of
winter and 1 will be there. I just have so
much fun with the game."
It shows in her smiles and cheers
after she nails a big 3-pointer — or after
she witnesses one of her teammates do
the same.
"Chemistry makes a big difference
and I think that's a big part of why we're
doing better," said Powell. "The chem
istry really is better and you can see it out
there — everyone's having a good time
and no one can take that away from us.
No matter what five are out there, we're
all playing for each other and it's your
teammates that really make [the season]

It's only taken two years under Tara VanDerveer's tutelage for sophomore guard / forward Nicole Powell to blossom into one of the
country's most talented players. With Stanford's deepest squad in years surrounding her, Powell may lead the Cardinal to its first na
tional championship since 1992.

Stanford has come a long way.
The team is back among the top
programs in the country after a
four-year drought, and for the
fourth time in school history, the

end and is lighting for the right
to host the first round of the
NCAAs on the road to the Final
Four.
In some respects, the season is
just beginning.
"This is when it's critical that I
play my best," Powell said. "We've
been searching for the perfect
game as a team and I've been
searching fora perfect game indi
vidually. This is it. It doesn't mat
ter how well we did in the past —

you can't say we didn't have a suc
cessful season, because we did, but
it wouldn't be what we want. I just
want to go out there and play hard
every possession."
With her work ethic, her quiet
confidence and her intimate un
derstanding of the game, Powell
has understandably garnered
national attention, with both
ESPN and Sports Illustrated
among those queueing up for in
terviews. As both a Pac-10 Player
of the Year candidate and Nai

smith Finalist, she is included
among a select group of the
country's best.
While such recognition is nice,
in Powell's mind, it is still all about
the game.
"1 just want to get better as a
basketball player," said Powell.
"I'm doing well, but I feel like
there's a lot of room to improve
so I can continue to help the
team. This isn't going to be the
end — we're back and we're here
to stay."
