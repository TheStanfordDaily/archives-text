# It's not as bad as you think, Cardinal fans
## Stanford can top Arizona schools, make run in tournament 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
In reality, only one game sepa
rates No. 14 Arizona from No. 17
Stanford.
Admittedly, a one-game lead with
two games left to play is a big deal
— it almost seems like a mountain.
However, only two games sep
arate the first-place team, Ore
gon, from the fifth-place Cardi
nal. And two teams sit tied in sec
ond place, with Arizona only one
game back from the conference
leading Ducks.
Vet, despite their markedly dif
ferent positions right now, the Car
dinal and the Wildcats are strikingly
similar.

The most obvious comparison
between Stanford and Arizona
rests in the fact that both teams are
recovering from a raft of senior de
partures. As NCAA competition
began this season, both (he Cardi
nal and the Wildcats were forced to
put four new starters on the floor,
with a slew of questions surround
ing both:
I low could either team live up to
the expectations set by the teams'
success in recent seasons? Would a
"rebuilding year" tarnish the repu
tations of the programs and their
revered coaching staffs? Was this
year the end of an era?
It didn't take long for both
squads to give resounding answers
on the court.
The Wildcats emerged early as a
preseason surprise, knocking off
non-conference heavyweights Maiy
land, Texas, Illinois and Purdue.
Stanford played unexpectedly
well too, beating Michigan State and

Purdue while falling to competitive
teams like Texas and Brigham
Young.
But after last week's season-alter
ing losses, the Cardinal is left scram
bling to rediscover its confidence.
"We have a lot of talent on this
team and we have a lot of heart on
this team," said sophomore forward
Joe Kirchofer. "We just need to put
it all together. We've sort of been
saying that fora long time and this
week [against Arizona] is the time
that it's got to happen. We have to
make it happen."
Stanford can't feel alone in its
Los Angeles woes, however. It
was only two weeks ago that the
Wildcats found out how tough
UCLA and Southern California
really are.
In a conference where su
premacy is ever-shifting, it's easy to
forget that the Wildcats lost two in
a row, too.
It seems that the complexion of

this conference and each team's
confidence changes dramatically
from week to week. 1 n that case, Ari
zona has hatl a little more time to
nurse its ailing LA wounds. The
Wildcats picked up a win against
Arizona State last Thursday, which
reminded them that they are still ca
pable of winning.
And you can't compare Stanford
to Arizona without mentioning the
team's brightest stars, namely ju
niors Casey Jacobsen and Luke
Walton.
Walton, a 6-foot-8 forward, is
12th in the league in scoring, aver
aging just under 16 points per
game. He also leads the conference
in assists and is fourth in rebound
ing. He's the consummate all
around player.
The 6-foot-6 Jacobsen, on the
other hand, makes his presence
known mostly on the scoreboard.
The swingman leads the Pac-10 in
scoring and not only leads this CCar

dinal squad in assists, hut also
ranks ninth in the conference in
that category.
The last time the two Southern
(California natives met — four weeks
ago at Maples Pavilion—Jacobsen
won the scoring battle but Walton
won the game.
"Luke's defensive job on Jacob

sen in the second half was key [to
our victory]," said Arizona head
coach Lute ()lson after the Wildcats
overcame a 15-point deficit to shock
the Cardinal at home.
"We have been hurt before
against Arizona matchup-wise,"

With Justin Davis still nursing a rib injury, Curtis Borchardtand Teyo Johnson
will need to stay out of foul trouble against Channing Frye and the rest of the
Arizona frontcourt.
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "That's exactly why
they've been so successful this sea
son — they pose matchup prob
lems for people."
The biggest difference between
these two teams may be found in
each squad's mentality this week.
The Wildcats enter this final
week of regular season Pac-10 play
still with the dream of a title, while
Stanford now most probably plays
for positioning.
"One week ago we were the

No. 10 team in the nation and
faced the prospect of winning two
games at home and then going to
Arizona to try and win a confer
ence championship," Mont
gomery said. "It just goes to show
that there aren't any guarantees."
"It's the biggest game of the
year for us, because it's the next
game," said sophomore forward
Teyo Johnson. "It's rumored
that if we don't win these (wo,
[there will be] no [NCAA] tour
nament. We need to rediscover
our intensity."
Both teams don't control their
own respective destinies anymore.
Arizona still needs an Oregon
loss and two victories this weekend

to secure a spot atop the conference.
Stanford, on the other hand,
needs a whole slew of magic to hap
pen — two Oregon losses, two Cal
losses, two UCLA wins and a USC
loss to Oregon State — in addition
to two must-have victories in the
desert in order to claim a share of
the regular season title.
But miracles have happened in
the past.
Just ask t he Cardinal, who before
last week's disaster, found itself in
first-place after an eventful week of
Plac-lO play.
Or just ask the Wildcats, who
have defied preseason naysayers to
emerge as one of the nation's top
teams.
