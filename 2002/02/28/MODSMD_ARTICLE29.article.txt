# Cardinal big favorite in women's tourney
## Only Yamasaki's injury may slow down the Stanford Express 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last year when the Pacific 10
Conference women's basketball
coaches voted on whether to hold a
post-season conference tourna
ment, Stanford head coach lata
VanDerveer was the only one who
expressed dissatisfaction with the
idea.
A year later, with the inaugural
Pac-10 women's tournament a day
away, VanDerveer's squad is the
only team in the conference that
has something to lose. After sweep
ing through league play with a
perfect 18-0 record, an early exit in
the conference tournament is
probably the only thing that can
prevent the Cardinal from clinch
ing the No. 1 seed in the West Re
gional of the NCAA Tournament.
However, while Stanford is
playing fora seed, the other teams
lingering at the top of the confer
ence standings are playing for their

seasons. They recognize that a run
at Eugene this weekend is their last
opportunity to impress the NCAA
selection committee or even grab
the Pac- 10's automatic NCAA bid.
Arizona State (21-8, 12-6 Pac
-10) is the only other team in the
conference that has likely assured
itself of a place in the Big Dance.
The Sun Devils enter the tour
nament having won five of their
last seven games, tying them with
Washington (17-10, 12-6) for sec
ond place in the conference. But a
tiebreaker leaves the Sun Devils
with the No. 3 seed in the tourna
ment, forcing a meeting with in
state rival Arizona (14-13, 10-8) in
the first round.
The Wildcats are a tough No. 6
seed, as witnessed by their 72-66
defeat of Arizona State in Tucson
this Saturday. But without a seri
ous Pac-10 tournament run, Ari
zona doesn't have an NCAA tour
nament prayer.
Both teams boast a host of tal
ented seniors, and after splitting
their games this season for the first
time since 1991, this first round
contest promises to be a brutal bat
tle for state bragging rights.
As the No. 2 seed in the tourna
ment, Washington is in arguably

the mosl precarious NCAA tour
nament position. With only 17
wins overall, the Huskies are hard
ly assured of a tournament bid.
While the team garnered a first
round bye, Washington can hard
ly waltz through its game on Satur
day, when it will meet the winner
of Oregon (15-12, 10-8) and Wash
ington State's (2-26, 0-18) first
round match-up.
Washington split with the
Ducks in regular season action, but
will have to put the clamps on Ore
gon guard Shaquala Williams to
make it to the second round. The
presence of Williams, the second
leading scorer in the conference,
ensures Oregon won't be taken
lightly by every other team in the
tournament.
The Ducks shouldn't be count
ed out of the post-season picture
quite yet either, and if they get
going on the perimeter, they have
the potential of winning some
games and earning an NCAA bid.
Rounding out the first round
matchups are No. 4 seed Southern
California (15-12, 11-7) and No. 5
Oregon State (15-13, 11-7). Finish
ing with equal records in confer
ence play, the Women of Troy and
the Beavers are both looking to

lengthen their seasons.
Oregon State's roster is high
lighted by senior guard Felicia
kagland, the 2001 Pac-10 Player
of the Year and this year's confer
ence leading scorer. The Pac-10
tourney is Ragland's last chance
at distinction in an illustrious ca
reer that has yet to include an
NCAA berth.
While the Beavers' strength lies
in their senior leadership, USC
brings a young, unpredictable but
highly-talented team to the tour
ney. Sophomores Ebony Hoff
mann and Aisha Hollans are
strong offensive threats for the
Trojans and are eager to turn the
team from a mid-conference per
former to a contender on the na
tional level.
However, despite the high lev
els of talent, excitement and desire
that every team brings into the
tournament, the Cardinal still re
mains the undeniable favorite.
And while the absence of Car
dinal senior guard Lindsey Ya
masaki, opens the door for any
team in the Pac-10 to step in and
claim the tournament title and
the automatic bid, nearly perfect
play will be needed to stop Stan
ford domination.

Even though Stanford dominated Pac-10 regular season play, a team like
Washington could get hot and give the Cardinal a game in Eugene.
