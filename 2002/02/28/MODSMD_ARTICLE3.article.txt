# Postdocs discuss grievances
## Status of fellows and salaries among topics presented at meeting 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I'he Stanford University Post
doc Association mei at Fairchild
Auditorium in the Medical School
yesterday for its annual town-hall
meeting to discuss issues relating
to postdoctoral fellows on campus.
Approximately 100 fellows
were present.
"One of the objectives of the
group is to improve postdoctoral
conditions on campus," said psy
chology fellow Audrey Ettinger.
Ettinger is the co-chair of the or
ganization, along with neurobiol
ogy fellow Karen Christopherson.
The association was created
three years ago and is sponsored
by the Office of the Associate Dean
of Postdoctoral Affairs.
Other objectives for fellows
include working on improving
postdoctoral benefits and "giv
ing people a chance to socialize,"
Ettinger said.
Christopherson commented
on the goals of the meeting.
" The real goal is to let people
know what we've done in the past
year," Christopherson said. "We
want to get input from postdocs
about their issues."
Developmental Biology Fel
low Derk ten Berge spoke ab6ut
the goals and achievements of
the organization.
Among the goals of the associ
ation are achieving pay and ben
efits comparable to University
staff, and giving fellows an ap
propriate University status, ac
cording to ten Berge.

The organization's achieve
ments include a reduction of tu
ition from $3980 per year to $500
per year, renewed access to Stan
ford Hospital and its doctors, seats
on Stanford's policy-making com
mittees and membership to the
University of California's council
of postdoctoral scholars.
Despite the group's achieve
ments, organizers said there are
many postdoc issues that need to
be addressed.
"Why does Stanford have such
a low opinion of postdocs?"
physics fellow Laura Baudis said.
"Postdocs are classified as stu
dents."
According to Ettinger, the Uni
versity considers fellows students
despite years of training and de
grees that put them on the same
academic level as University facul
ty. A recent advance on this front
has been an aesthetic change of
the fellow status on Stanford I l)s.
"Changing [thej postdoc status
on 11) cards was a step forward,"
Ettinger said.
"It's a cultural change,"
Christopherson said. "We have to

change people's mindset about
what a postdoc is."
Other issues included post
doctoral salaries and adequate
child care.
"The postdoctoral position
may be an outdated concept," one
fellow said. "We're more qualified
than postdocs 20 to 30 years ago,
yet we get half of the salary of a
starting high school teacher in
California."
"We're moving ahead on issues
with saidries," James Nelson, a
professor at the Medical School,
said. "We're trying hard to help —
it takes time to make a change."
Members of the audience re
flected on the issues surrounding
the fellows' condition.
"The most important issue for
postdocs is their salaries," genetics
fellow Quan Lu said. "We are no
longer like students and it is hard
to live in an area with such a high
cost of living."
"Subsidized child care is a real
important issue," psychology fel
low Karen Kasch said. "Availabil-


lOY LEE/The Stanford Daily
ity of child care is another
issue — most [childcare] centers
on campus have about a two-year
waiting list."
"The lact thai I have to support
one child and that I can't do so ac
cording to my own wishes is urn
bearable," Haudis said. "You have
to do your family planning accord
ing to Stanford, which is tinlair."
According to ten Berge, the
group's (uture endeavors are es
tablishing a higher minimum
salary that keeps pace with na
tional standards and local costs of
living, garnering an appropriate
non-student status and pushing
for consistent and adequate
health insurance benefits.
