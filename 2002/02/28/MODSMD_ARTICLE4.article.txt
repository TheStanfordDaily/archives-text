# Graduates face an uncertain job market
## Seniors and students search for jobs, but few available 
### SCOTT DORFMAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With the United States in an
economic downturn and the dot
com boom all but busted, gradu
ating seniors and graduate stu
dents at universities throughout
the U.S. are looking for employ
ment in the tightest job market
since 1994, according to the Na
tional Association of Colleges

and Employers. Unfortunately,
the situation appears no differ
ent at Stanford.
"It is a tight market," Career
Development Center Director
Lance Choy said. "Employers are
still hiring, though. Students just
have to try harder in order to get
what they are looking for."
According to Choy, this year's
CDC-sponsored Career l airs have
illustrated of the severity of the em
ployment crunch.
"We are coming off such a hot
market, something like I'd never
seen before," Choy said. "[ln pre
vious years], students would just
walk up to a booth at Career Fair

and get a job . . . This year, the
business component of the Liber
al Arts career fair was down 50
percent, but the regular liberal
arts part was the same. Company
attendance overall is down 30 to
40 percent."
National statistics echo ('.hoy's
findings. Marilyn F. Mackes, exec
utive director of the National Asso
ciation of Colleges and Employers,
told I'he New York Times that 20
to 25 percent fewer jobs will be
available for students graduating
with a bachelor's degree this year.
In addition, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported that the unem
ployment level for college gradu

ates who are 25 or over — nearly 3
percent — is the highest since
April 1993.
Choy said the biggest hiring
drop-offs have been in the sectors
often seen as most coveted by Stan
ford students.
" The big ones we've seen are in
investment banking and consult
ing, those are way down," Choy
said. "It has been extremely com
petitive. Tech companies, a lot of
them are still hiring, but a lot are
not. It requires more effort by stu
dents to find out which segments
of companies are hiring."
