# Graduates face an uncertain job market
## Seniors and students search for jobs, but few available 
### SCOTT DORFMAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With the United States in an
economic downturn and the dot
com boom all but busted, gradu
ating seniors and graduate stu
dents at universities throughout
the U.S. are looking for employ
ment in the tightest job market
since 1994, according to the Na
tional Association of Colleges

and Employers. Unfortunately,
the situation appears no differ
ent at Stanford.
"It is a tight market," Career
Development Center Director
Lance Choy said. "Employers are
still hiring, though. Students just
have to try harder in order to get
what they are looking for."
According to Choy, this year's
CDC-sponsored Career l airs have
illustrated of the severity of the em
ployment crunch.
"We are coming off such a hot
market, something like I'd never
seen before," Choy said. "[ln pre
vious years], students would just
walk up to a booth at Career Fair

and get a job . . . This year, the
business component of the Liber
al Arts career fair was down 50
percent, but the regular liberal
arts part was the same. Company
attendance overall is down 30 to
40 percent."
National statistics echo ('.hoy's
findings. Marilyn F. Mackes, exec
utive director of the National Asso
ciation of Colleges and Employers,
told I'he New York Times that 20
to 25 percent fewer jobs will be
available for students graduating
with a bachelor's degree this year.
In addition, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported that the unem
ployment level for college gradu

ates who are 25 or over — nearly 3
percent — is the highest since
April 1993.
Choy said the biggest hiring
drop-offs have been in the sectors
often seen as most coveted by Stan
ford students.
" The big ones we've seen are in
investment banking and consult
ing, those are way down," Choy
said. "It has been extremely com
petitive. Tech companies, a lot of
them are still hiring, but a lot are
not. It requires more effort by stu
dents to find out which segments
of companies are hiring."

Many students nationwide are
looking elsewhere for post-gradu
ation opportunities, mainly to
graduate schools and groups like
AmeriCorps and l each lor Ameri
ca. According to the Law School
Admission Council, applications
tor law schools nationwide are up
25.2 percent this year.
Some Stanford students are fol
lowing this trend.
"I've seen a lot of students ex
ploring alternatives," Choy said.
"People are saying they are going
to teach English in China or do
community service work."
"Since I figured that the odds
ratio of me finding employment
was monotonically approaching
zero over time, I decided to do a
co-term in statistics instead of

working," senior Dan kinna
mon said.
Others are playing the waiting
game, hoping to find the position
they believe they are destined for.
"I'm really trying to confine my
search to positions that will enable
me to foster the most social
change," senior lien Rattray said.
"As a Stanford student and benefi
ciary of dumb luck in my genetic
endowments and familial circum
stances, 1 feel the responsibility to
give back to my community. So I'm
only applying to investment banks
and consulting firms."
Still others see no need to worry
about their job prospects.
"I've been using the poor job
market as an excuse to not even
look fora job," senior MikeCharyk
said. "But 1 figure my friends will
be generous enough to let me
sleep on their couches fora while."
"I'm not too worried, since I'm
not adot-commerand I figure that

there will definitely be someone
out there willing to hire someone
who will work for $20,000 a year,"
senior Hen Coates said.
Choy said ii is important to "be
creative" when looking fora job,
and to not simply rely on easy av
enues like resume Web sites.
Often, direct contact with a com
pany is far more effective, since it
shows initiative and interest to the
employer. Choy also stressed that
the CDC is always available lor
consultation.
Regardless of the type of em
ployment one is looking for or the
severity of the job shortage, Choy
said that Stanford students already
have a leg up on counterparts
112 rom other schools.
"if 1 have a stack of resumes,
and I see a Stanford resume, I'll
look at it first," Choy said. "It's a
big advantage. Stanford students
are smart, resourceful, and they'll
land on their feet."
