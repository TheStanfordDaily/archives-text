# Senate debates funding, election
## 
### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Funding and the upcoming
election weighed on the minds
of the Undergraduate Sena
tors at their meeting on Tues
day night.
One of the body's few faculty
guests this year, Drama and

Classics Prof.
Rush Rehm,
asked the Sen
ate to sponsor

two speakers he had previously
brought to the University.
Rehm noted that University
administrators had encouraged
him to bring the speakers —
who discussed Nike's overseas
labor practices — to campus.
Since the Department of Athlet
ics has a contract with Nike, it
was deemed valuable by admin
istrators, Rehm said, to provide
alternate viewpoints on the
issue. However, he said the
University would not pay for
the event.
He said the speakers' hono
raria totaled $2500. He had
raised $1500, but needed an
extra $1000 to pay the
speakers — whom he described
as "poor folks" who only sought
to cover their traveling expenses
with the money.
"It's not like it goes to any
one's pocket," Rehm said. "It's a
good deal."
Student groups, though will
ing to associate their names
with the event's publicity, were
not able to help pay for it,
Rehm said.
"[Stanford Labor Action

Coalition] and Amnesty [Inter
national] both said they'd
sponsor it, but had no money,"
he said.
Senators suggested he try
the ASSU Speakers' Bureau,
which can fund both faculty
speakers and retroactive hono
raria. In addition, they also
noted that Amnesty Interna-

tional could
apply for Gen
eral Fee fund
ing to cover the

event. Both of these sources,
Senators assured, would have a
much larger bankroll than
spending what was left in the
discretionary fund.
Rehm left the meeting
with a favorable impression
of the Senators.
"They're great," Rehm said.
"They're very nice."
The United Students for
Veterans' Health and the
Stanford Objectivist Club
also received ASSU funding.
The latter group evoked a bit
of controversy, however,
when it was questioned as to
whether the group had vio
lated the University's Acts of
Intolerance Policy with two
October Daily advertise
ments. The Senate ques
tioned if it could continue to
fund the Objectivist Club,
even though the offending ad
wasn't purchased with ASSU
General Fees.
"If a group is violating some
thing, maybe they shouldn't get
funded," said Senator Sonrisa

Lucero, a junior, who felt the deci
sion should be postponed until the
Senate had more information
about the issue.
Persian students, said Senate
Associate Courtney Sims, a fresh
man, didn't perceive the advertise
ment as intimidation, but more so
as ignorance.
"[Asst. Dean of Students]
Tommy Lee Woon got in contact
with the people who were offend
ed by [the ad]," Senator Bo
Cowgill, a junior, said. He noted
the Stanford Objectivist Club had
broken one of the lower levels of
the policy. "Which means," he
said, "[they] didn't make a threat
ening statement, they made an of
fensive statement."
"I'm uncomfortable for cutting *

off funding to a group tor express
ing an opinion ... in print, with
out ASSU funding," Student Life
Co-Chair Nick Rodriguez, a
sophomore, said. "I think we
should just fund them. Violation of
this protocol is defined by some
one else's feelings about it."
"The ASSU lias a free speech
obligation," Nominations Com
mittee Chair Henry Towsner, a ju
nior, said, reminding the Senate
that funding couldn't be denied
on the basis to objecting to some
one's speech.
The bill passed 9-0-2.
The Senate also voted to finance
part of the Midnight Breakfast,
splitting the costs with (he Univer
sity, the Graduate Student Coun
cil, and the Office of the ASSU
President and Vice President.
Cowgill inquired as to who was
responsible for student behavior at
the event, given that administra
tors would be present. The issue

was never resolved, although
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves reminded the Senate that
the University, not the ASSU, pays
for the bulk of the event.
In other Senate business, Sen
ate Associate Josh Shipp, a fresh
man, noted that the ASSU-spon
sored Draw Guide survey would
have to be extended.
"We received 155 responses,
which is pretty woeful," Shipp said.
"We're redoubling our efforts to
publicize it."
He also noted that — to his
knowledge — only one Senator
had filled out the Draw Guide
Survey.
Finally, upcoming elections
were discussed. Senate Chair
Alex Shvartsman, a senior, urged
Senators to propose three to five
questions that candidates ought
to be answering in their cam
paign, "to make* this election
more information-based and less

slogan-based."
Towsner discussed the recent
decision by residential education
to forbid campaign flyers in resi
dence bathrooms and candi
dates from going door-to-door
to meet voters.
"Res Ed has decided that
they're opposed to the whole
'issue-based campaigning' thing,"
Towsner said. He said the Senate
ought to challenge this decision.
ASSU President Matt Brewer, a
junior, agreed.
"The entire integrity of the
ASSU needs to be upheld, and
these are two of the best forums,"
Brewer, said.
Vice President Christine
Cordero, a senior, recalled that vis
iting voters door-to-door was "one
of the best things of campaigning."
"It's an issue we should push,"
Shvartsman said. " The only fly
ers that are issue flyers are bath
room fivers."

Rehm left the meeting
with a favorable impression

"They're great," Rehm said.
"They're very nice."
The United Students for
Veterans' Health and the
Stanford Objectivist Club
also received ASSU funding.
The latter group evoked a bit
of controversy, however,
when it was questioned as to
whether the group had vio
lated the University's Acts of
Intolerance Policy with two
October Daily advertise
ments. The Senate ques
tioned if it could continue to
fund the Objectivist Club,
even though the offending ad
wasn't purchased with ASSU
General Fees.
"If a group is violating some
thing, maybe they shouldn't get
funded," said Senator Sonrisa

Lucero, a junior, who felt the deci
sion should be postponed until the
Senate had more information
about the issue.
Persian students, said Senate
Associate Courtney Sims, a fresh
man, didn't perceive the advertise
ment as intimidation, but more so
as ignorance.
"[Asst. Dean of Students]
Tommy Lee Woon got in contact
with the people who were offend
ed by [the ad]," Senator Bo
Cowgill, a junior, said. He noted
the Stanford Objectivist Club had
broken one of the lower levels of
the policy. "Which means," he
said, "[they] didn't make a threat
ening statement, they made an of
fensive statement."
"I'm uncomfortable for cutting *

off funding to a group tor express

out ASSU funding," Student Life
Co-Chair Nick Rodriguez, a
sophomore, said. "I think we
should just fund them. Violation of
this protocol is defined by some
one else's feelings about it."
"The ASSU lias a free speech
obligation," Nominations Com
mittee Chair Henry Towsner, a ju
nior, said, reminding the Senate
that funding couldn't be denied
on the basis to objecting to some
one's speech.
The bill passed 9-0-2.
The Senate also voted to finance
part of the Midnight Breakfast,
splitting the costs with (he Univer
sity, the Graduate Student Coun
cil, and the Office of the ASSU
President and Vice President.
Cowgill inquired as to who was
responsible for student behavior at
the event, given that administra
tors would be present. The issue

was never resolved, although
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves reminded the Senate that
the University, not the ASSU, pays
for the bulk of the event.
In other Senate business, Sen
ate Associate Josh Shipp, a fresh
man, noted that the ASSU-spon
sored Draw Guide survey would
have to be extended.
"We received 155 responses,
which is pretty woeful," Shipp said.
"We're redoubling our efforts to
publicize it."
He also noted that — to his
knowledge — only one Senator
had filled out the Draw Guide
Survey.
Finally, upcoming elections
were discussed. Senate Chair
Alex Shvartsman, a senior, urged
Senators to propose three to five
questions that candidates ought
to be answering in their cam
paign, "to make* this election
more information-based and less

slogan-based."
Towsner discussed the recent
decision by residential education
to forbid campaign flyers in resi
dence bathrooms and candi
dates from going door-to-door
to meet voters.
"Res Ed has decided that
they're opposed to the whole
'issue-based campaigning' thing,"
Towsner said. He said the Senate
ought to challenge this decision.
ASSU President Matt Brewer, a
junior, agreed.
"The entire integrity of the
ASSU needs to be upheld, and
these are two of the best forums,"
Brewer, said.
Vice President Christine
Cordero, a senior, recalled that vis
iting voters door-to-door was "one
of the best things of campaigning."
"It's an issue we should push,"
Shvartsman said. " The only fly
ers that are issue flyers are bath
room fivers."
Funding and the upcoming
election weighed on the minds
of the Undergraduate Sena
tors at their meeting on Tues
day night.
One of the body's few faculty
guests this year, Drama and

Classics Prof.
Rush Rehm,
asked the Sen
ate to sponsor

two speakers he had previously
brought to the University.
Rehm noted that University
administrators had encouraged
him to bring the speakers —
who discussed Nike's overseas
labor practices — to campus.
Since the Department of Athlet
ics has a contract with Nike, it
was deemed valuable by admin
istrators, Rehm said, to provide
alternate viewpoints on the
issue. However, he said the
University would not pay for
the event.
He said the speakers' hono
raria totaled $2500. He had
raised $1500, but needed an
extra $1000 to pay the
speakers — whom he described
as "poor folks" who only sought
to cover their traveling expenses
with the money.
"It's not like it goes to any
one's pocket," Rehm said. "It's a
good deal."
Student groups, though will
ing to associate their names
with the event's publicity, were
not able to help pay for it,
Rehm said.
"[Stanford Labor Action

Coalition] and Amnesty [Inter
national] both said they'd
sponsor it, but had no money,"
he said.
Senators suggested he try
the ASSU Speakers' Bureau,
which can fund both faculty
speakers and retroactive hono
raria. In addition, they also
noted that Amnesty Interna-

tional could
apply for Gen
eral Fee fund
ing to cover the

event. Both of these sources,
Senators assured, would have a
much larger bankroll than
spending what was left in the
discretionary fund.
Rehm left the meeting
