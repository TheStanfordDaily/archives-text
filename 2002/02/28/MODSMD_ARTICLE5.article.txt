# Senate debates funding, election

### JOHN HUETTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Funding and the upcoming
election weighed on the minds
of the Undergraduate Sena
tors at their meeting on Tues
day night.
One of the body's few faculty
guests this year, Drama and

Classics Prof.
Rush Rehm,
asked the Sen
ate to sponsor

two speakers he had previously
brought to the University.
Rehm noted that University
administrators had encouraged
him to bring the speakers —
who discussed Nike's overseas
labor practices — to campus.
Since the Department of Athlet
ics has a contract with Nike, it
was deemed valuable by admin
istrators, Rehm said, to provide
alternate viewpoints on the
issue. However, he said the
University would not pay for
the event.
He said the speakers' hono
raria totaled $2500. He had
raised $1500, but needed an
extra $1000 to pay the
speakers — whom he described
as "poor folks" who only sought
to cover their traveling expenses
with the money.
"It's not like it goes to any
one's pocket," Rehm said. "It's a
good deal."
Student groups, though will
ing to associate their names
with the event's publicity, were
not able to help pay for it,
Rehm said.
"[Stanford Labor Action

Coalition] and Amnesty [Inter
national] both said they'd
sponsor it, but had no money,"
he said.
Senators suggested he try
the ASSU Speakers' Bureau,
which can fund both faculty
speakers and retroactive hono
raria. In addition, they also
noted that Amnesty Interna-

tional could
apply for Gen
eral Fee fund
ing to cover the

event. Both of these sources,
Senators assured, would have a
much larger bankroll than
spending what was left in the
discretionary fund.
Rehm left the meeting
with a favorable impression
of the Senators.
"They're great," Rehm said.
"They're very nice."
The United Students for
Veterans' Health and the
Stanford Objectivist Club
also received ASSU funding.
The latter group evoked a bit
of controversy, however,
when it was questioned as to
whether the group had vio
lated the University's Acts of
Intolerance Policy with two
October Daily advertise
ments. The Senate ques
tioned if it could continue to
fund the Objectivist Club,
even though the offending ad
wasn't purchased with ASSU
General Fees.
"If a group is violating some
thing, maybe they shouldn't get
funded," said Senator Sonrisa
