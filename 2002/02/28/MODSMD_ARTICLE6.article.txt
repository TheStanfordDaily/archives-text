# Ombudsman provides mediation and support
## 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Do you have a gripe or conflict
with someone that you need to re
solve? Do you need someone who
is impartial and neutral to the situ
ation to help you?
Ellen Waxman, Stanford's om
budsman and director of die Stan
ford Mediation ( .enter, is available
for help. Waxman offers an infor
mal, neutral and confidential way
of mediating problems for mem
bers of the Stanford community.
According to Waxman, om
budsmen listen to students, facul
ty and stall without holding any
biases. Ombudsmen's strategies
include coaching, trying to under
stand conflicts from all perspec
tives, developing strategies for
resolutions that fit all parties'goals
and mediating between conflict
ing parties.
"What I do a lot of is helping
people take the emotions and the
facts that go along with the situa
tion and put that into a logical
framework, along with their inter
ests, their goals and their rights,"
Waxman said, "112 am someone
who exists within the University
but whose function is to ask the
University to self-examine some
of its actions."
Waxman said she shows the
person seeking advice how the
other person is thinking in order

to give parties a clearer idea of how
to deal with the problem.
Originally from Texas and ed
ucated at Smith College, Waxman
was trained as a trial lawyer but
later decided to become an om
budsman because of her interest
in mediation.
"Somewhere along the way in
my legal career, I became more
satisfied in dealing with how prob
lems were being resolved in medi
ation," Waxman said. "I've always
been interested in how individuals
are treated within a bureaucracy."
Stanford is one of the pioneer
universities in supporting an om
buds program. Stanford has main
tained an Ombudsman's office
since 1969.
According to Waxman, om
budsmen are a by-product of the
riots in the late 1960s and 19705.
"There was a thought that an
ombuds position was one way to
help have an outlet for listening
that would address issues of stu
dent unrest," Waxman said.
The Stanford Mediation Cen
ter, which is separate from the
Ombudsman's Office, serves
much of the same purpose — to
help people within the University
resolve disputes with the help of a
neutral person.
The Ombudsman's Office is lo
cated in Building 310, Room 101.
