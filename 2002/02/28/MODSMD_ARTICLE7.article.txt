# Business School presents entrepreneur panel
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate School of Business held its
sixth annual Entrepreneurship Conference on
Feb. 23. The conference featured 12 panel dis
cussions and three workshops. More than 70
speakers participated, including Google
founder Larry Page and Vice President of Di
rect Advice Larry Ford. Nolan Bushnell, the
founder, chairman and CEO of uWink and
founder of the Atari Corporation and Chuck
E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater, also spoke at
the event.
Despite the economic slowdown, the show
was a sellout.
"It was a little more difficult this year given
the market climate, but 1 think the people that
showed up are as interested or more interested
in entrepreneurship," said Brian Owns, Busi
ness School student and co-chair of the event.
David Goldberg, vice president and general
manager for music at Yahoo and former CEO
and founder of Launch Media, spoke at a panel
titled "Convergence: Entertainment and Tech
nology in the 21st Century." The panel dis

cussed video on demand, music and high-defi
nition television. According to Goldberg, con
ventional analog TV sets now cost only a few
hundred dollars each, but digital HDTV sets
and monitors cost thousands of dollars. Large,
flat TV screens with sizes over 50 inches cost up
to $20,000 per set, and digital tuners cost close
to $200.
"The biggest TV you can get is the best TV
you can get — the TV market is all about
price," said Lawrence Marcus, general partner
of WaldenVC. "You are just starting to see
some flat panels hit the consumer electronics
channel, and they're coming in 42 inches for
about $5,000 to $6,000."
"We're involved in the U.S.-Japan space and
1 believe t hat the flat screen and the pricing of
the HDTV screens are at a point where they're
a novelty," said Richard Kiwata of Japan Mar
kets. "Until the pricing comes down, they're
not going to be accepted in this marketplace."
Still, there seems to be hope for their future.
"I believe [that] as prices drop down, the
high-definition system will come in very quick
ly," Bushnell said. "[Large flat displays] are
clearly the direction of things to come."

Speakers said that one of the most promis
ing innovations is a flat monitor based on elec
troluminescent technology. Though the idea is
not new, an absence of appropriate color elec
troluminescent phosphors has prevented elec
troluminescent systems from coming to mar
ket. Only a few companies in the world develop
electroluminescent phosphors and it is not a
high priority for them. However, preliminary
calculations show that the mass production of a
50-inch flat electroluminescent screen could
cost less than $600.
MIT played a significant role in developing
the digital HDTV, under the leadership of
Prof. Jae Lin. Stanford is also a potential leader
in the development of large HDTV screens
and monitors of any type, including flat mod
els. By facilitating research, Stanford can be a
leader in providing affordable flat-panel
HDTV to consumers.
Audience members found the confer
ence rewarding.
"The speakers were all very interesting and
had significant experience in their field," said
Derek McCalmont, a Sloan Fellow at the Busi
ness School.
