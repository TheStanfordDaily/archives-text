## The
						Stanford Daily Dining Services has greatly improved quality 
### 
This winter, Stanford Dining Services
opened the newly renovated Wilbur
Dining Hall. This, along with last
year's renovation of Stern Dining
and the opening of the renovated Lakeside
Dining in 1999, forms a substantial overhaul
and upgrade of Stanford's residential dining
facilities. We laud Dining Services for the job it
has done in revamping all three facilities, mak
ing them into pleasant places to eat.
Dining Services followed the same basic
formula with all three cafeterias: it opened
up the servery and set aside dedicated areas
for different types of cooking, such as the
grill, sandwiches, pasta, salads, stir-fry and
rotisserie chicken. Doing so highlights the
different choices available at each meal. The

wider variety of dishes now provided is a
great improvement, as all diners certainly
appreciate choice.
With the renovations came renewed atten
tion to quality as well. The dishes are fresher
and better-tasting in the renovated dining
halls than they were in the old ones. Given that
cooking for many people often precludes
preparing a gourmet meal, the chefs have
done an excellent job in making appetizing
food. The same also holds true in Florence
Moore and Manzanita Dining, which are not
quite as new as the three that were renovated.
Dining Services has also done an admirable
job in listening to student input. The managers
and workers try hard to respond to student
comments and concerns. One manifestation of

this is that in some dining halls they now pro
vide soy milk for those who are lactose-intoler
ant. Focusing on customer service — catering
to the people who pay for the product —
should be an important task for every organi
zation at the University, and Dining Services'
commitment to it is quite commendable.
This attention to service also shows in the
variety of dining plans available. People can
reasonably disagree over the merits of the all
you-can-eat plan versus a la carte points and
the merits of the Cardinal Flex Plan versus
19 meals per week, but the important thing is
that the choice is available. People's eating
habits are varied and finicky, so it is impor
tant that everyone has a choice to fit their
tastes and needs. We encourage Dining Ser-

vices to continue to invent new plans to serve
student eating habits. Some sort of reduced
meal plan — say 8 meals per week — would
be ideal for those students who eat in the din
ing hall, but often eat at other places. With
this plan, students would not have to pay for
meals that they do not eat. These sorts of im
provements will make the campus's food op
tions even better.
In short, the renovations have turned the
campus dining halls into a high-quality
group of eateries. Dining Services' attention
to detail has shown in the excellent job it has
done. We congratulate Dining Services on its
achievements with the renovations and en
courage it to keep up its commitment to ex
cellent customer service.
