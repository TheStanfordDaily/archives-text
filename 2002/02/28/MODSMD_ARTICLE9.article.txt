# CANNONBALL COMING
## Ozzy and the sell-outs 
### 
One thousand green M&Ms
in a wine glass. According to
the slow-talking, cockney-ac
cented roadie in "Wayne's
World 2," that's what it used to take to
get Ozzy Osbourne onstage.
Now, you just need a remote control.
Fora while now, it's been funny to hear
stories about all the former hell-raisers
who have developed a rampant case of old
balls. Or similarly, about successful, rich,
establishment-types who, we suddenly
find out, were getting jiggy with it well be
fore Michael Jackson lost his pigment .
Look at the 2000 presidential election.
We had the choice of A1 Core, who
smoked a Costco-sized load of marijuana
while at Harvard, and Ceoi ge Bush, ev-

eryone's favorite coke
snorting, Ivy-league Irat
boy. Al's bearded
makeover and Dubya's
wartime gravitas can't
paper over an obvious
fact — both are lucky to
have two natural nostrils.
Predictably the biggest
loser in the election —

other than the legion of confused Jewish
grandmothers from Palm Beach County
— was Ralph Nader, a fierce liberal who
nonetheless eschews the trinity of Ameri
can celebrity: sex, drugs and rock 'n roll.
The lesson in all of this? To make it in
this country anymore, you've got to have a
steamy, sordid, drug-addled past.
Enter Oz/.y.
In case you haven't heard of the Sa
tanic One or your idea of hard rock is
James Taylor with the volume turned
up, Ozzy Osbourne is the Prince of Dark
ness, the man whose possessed voice and
on-stage shenanigans as lead singer of
Black Sabbath helped fuel the rapid rise
of metal. Hair bands everywhere are his
twisted progeny.
Even now, 20 to 30 years after he bit the
heads off of live bat sand solitarily sucked
down two bottles of Jack Daniels before
most concerts, Ozzy remains a presence.
He's got a new album out in stores and lie's
still headlining OzzEest, his yearly slim
mer festival of musical deviance.
And now this.
Fresh off a successful Osbourne family
appearance on "Cribs" — the MTV show
that has given you a shirtless Robbie
Williams tagging a slice of air doggystyle

on his lace-bordered mattress and Out
kast's Big Boi giving the audience a fanta
sy test drive of his basement strip club —
Ozzy, his wife and two children will have a
new "reality" show every week on the
same network, starting March 5.
And, no, Mrs. Osbourne isn't
named Harriet.
American broadcast television has
moved steadily away from the homely,
white-washed sitcom family of the 1950'5.
Still, putting Ozzy and company on televi
sion isn't like inviting VVally and the Beav
into your home. And it's far riskier than
hoping that America would watch Cliff
Huxtable, Then, Rudy, Cockroach and
the gang every week. (A wildly successful
all-black sitcom was pretty revolutionary
at the time.)
For instance, unlike Bill Cosby, Ozzy
Osbourne has never made pudding com
mercials, provided the voice to everyone's
favorite lovably obese cartoon friend from
the ghetto, or hosted a show called "Kids
Say the Darndest Things." I'm afraid if
Ozzy had the chance, it would've been
called, "F—ing Wankers Who Mess With
My Buzz."
I he differences don't stop there. If
everyone were like O/.zy, our entire
population of livestock would be decap
itated within a matter of weeks. Our
food supply would be shot to hell. On
the other hand, if everyone were like
Cosby, we'd all be a lot funnier and
probably more athletic. And, thank
Cod, we wouldn'i have to watch any
more Winter Olympics. Skategate 2002
wasn't exactly working its way onto the
cover of Jet or Ebony.
But, now, with Ozzy on the tube, we
can tune in fora half-hour of live, only
slightly edited, dysfunction. If you have
ever watched that one Cribs episode fea
turing the Osbournes, you know what
I 'm talking about.
Ozzy always looks stoned, his chil
dren live in dark, candle-covered
shrines to suppressed rage and his wife
is a foul-mouthed, gluttonous, money
grubbing witch.
All of which means that, in modern-day
America, their new reality show is sure to
be a ratings winner.

One thousand green M&Ms
in a wine glass. According to
the slow-talking, cockney-ac
cented roadie in "Wayne's
World 2," that's what it used to take to
get Ozzy Osbourne onstage.
Now, you just need a remote control.
Fora while now, it's been funny to hear
stories about all the former hell-raisers
who have developed a rampant case of old
balls. Or similarly, about successful, rich,
establishment-types who, we suddenly
find out, were getting jiggy with it well be
fore Michael Jackson lost his pigment .
Look at the 2000 presidential election.
We had the choice of A1 Core, who
smoked a Costco-sized load of marijuana
while at Harvard, and Ceoi ge Bush, ev-

eryone's favorite coke
snorting, Ivy-league Irat
boy. Al's bearded
makeover and Dubya's
wartime gravitas can't
paper over an obvious
fact — both are lucky to
have two natural nostrils.
Predictably the biggest
loser in the election —

other than the legion of confused Jewish
grandmothers from Palm Beach County
— was Ralph Nader, a fierce liberal who
nonetheless eschews the trinity of Ameri
can celebrity: sex, drugs and rock 'n roll.
The lesson in all of this? To make it in
this country anymore, you've got to have a
steamy, sordid, drug-addled past.
Enter Oz/.y.
In case you haven't heard of the Sa
tanic One or your idea of hard rock is
James Taylor with the volume turned
up, Ozzy Osbourne is the Prince of Dark
ness, the man whose possessed voice and
on-stage shenanigans as lead singer of
Black Sabbath helped fuel the rapid rise
of metal. Hair bands everywhere are his
twisted progeny.
Even now, 20 to 30 years after he bit the
heads off of live bat sand solitarily sucked
down two bottles of Jack Daniels before
most concerts, Ozzy remains a presence.
He's got a new album out in stores and lie's
still headlining OzzEest, his yearly slim
mer festival of musical deviance.
And now this.
Fresh off a successful Osbourne family
appearance on "Cribs" — the MTV show
that has given you a shirtless Robbie
Williams tagging a slice of air doggystyle

on his lace-bordered mattress and Out
kast's Big Boi giving the audience a fanta
sy test drive of his basement strip club —
Ozzy, his wife and two children will have a
new "reality" show every week on the
same network, starting March 5.
And, no, Mrs. Osbourne isn't
named Harriet.
American broadcast television has
moved steadily away from the homely,
white-washed sitcom family of the 1950'5.
Still, putting Ozzy and company on televi
sion isn't like inviting VVally and the Beav
into your home. And it's far riskier than
hoping that America would watch Cliff
Huxtable, Then, Rudy, Cockroach and
the gang every week. (A wildly successful
all-black sitcom was pretty revolutionary
at the time.)
For instance, unlike Bill Cosby, Ozzy
Osbourne has never made pudding com
mercials, provided the voice to everyone's
favorite lovably obese cartoon friend from
the ghetto, or hosted a show called "Kids
Say the Darndest Things." I'm afraid if
Ozzy had the chance, it would've been
called, "F—ing Wankers Who Mess With
My Buzz."
I he differences don't stop there. If
everyone were like O/.zy, our entire
population of livestock would be decap
itated within a matter of weeks. Our
food supply would be shot to hell. On
the other hand, if everyone were like
Cosby, we'd all be a lot funnier and
probably more athletic. And, thank
Cod, we wouldn'i have to watch any
more Winter Olympics. Skategate 2002
