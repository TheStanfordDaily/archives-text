# New DVDs: What's Up, Doc?

### UDARA FERNANDO STAFF WRITER 
Prepare to hail the next genera
tion of DVDs. The new format will
have 27 gigabytes of memory on
one side of a single 4.7-inch disc,
allowing for more than 13 hours of
television to be recorded, corn
pared with two hours on the cur
rent 4.7 gigabyte disc. Nine con
sumer electronics manufacturers,
including Japanese giants Sony
Corporation and Matsushita Elec
tric Industrial Co. Ltd., have an
nounced that they will adapt to this
standard. The optical discs will be
called the "Blue-Ray Disc" after
the blue laser used to store infor
mation on them.
Track down your new-age global
position with the Rino 110 from
Garmin. The device does more than
simply keep track of your loca
tion —it beams your position to
others in your group who are using
the same radio and plots everyone's
whereabouts on its LCD. The stan
dard model sells for $ 169. The high
er-end Rino 120 ($249) adds 8
megabytes of internal memory and
additional mapping capabilities.
Madden Mills, makers of Po
lar Tec fleeces, have created a new
lineup of high-tech jackets that
create their own warmth, pow
ered by lightweight lithium bat
teries. The jackets conduct heat
through stainless steel mi
crofibers thinner than a human
hair. The fibers are as washable,
bendable and soft as the fabric
into which they're woven. The
technology has been licensed to
Land's End and to The North
Face, which is using it for the
high-end METS jacket.

Steven Winter Associates, a
home technology company, re
cently developed a method to har
vest sunlight and deliver it to dark,
windowless rooms. The technolo
gy, called passive fiber-optic day
lighting, uses four high-powered
Fresnel lenses to direct sunlight
onto a secondary lens called a

beam former. This lens concen
trates the light and transmits it
through 1/2-inch plastic fiber
optic cables to a standard light fix
ture, which can then deliver the
light. The company hopes to com
mercialize the technology some
time next year. The projected
price is $400 per fixture.
