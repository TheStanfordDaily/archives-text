AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” On the
eve of their historic Spanish-lan
guage debate, the two Democratic
candidates for governor of Texas
continued to bicker about the for
mat yesterday.
Dan Morales and Tony Sanchez
have agreed to take part in a one
hour English debate in Dallas
today, and a one-hour Spanish de
bate later in the evening. Both will
be televised.
It will be the first time candi
dates for governor of any state
have debated in Spanish, accord

ing to the National Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Of
ficials. Hispanic leaders see the
event as evidence of their growing
political clout.
The primary is March 12. The
winner faces Republican Gov. Rick
Perry.
Morales, who tried unsuccess
fully to get at least five debates in
English, vowed to spend time dur
ing Friday's telecast translating his
answers into English.
" fhe fact of the matter is that t he
vast majority of the citizens of our

state speak English," he said. "That
also applies to a significant number
of Hispanic Texans."
The candidates, who are both
Mexican-Americans, had bickered
for weeks about the format. Both
had supported the idea of one de
bate in Spanish, but differed on how
many English debates were needed.
"Mr. Sanchez's insistence that we
basically elevate Spanish, the Span
ish language, to an equal status with
the English language in this race for
governor of Texas is ill-advised,"
Morales said yesterday.
