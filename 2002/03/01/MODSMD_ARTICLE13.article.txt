## The Stanford Daily Honor Pearl's memory by studying Middle East
### 
Published Since J 891

One week ago today, the world
learned of the gruesome murder of
Daniel Pearl '85, a Wall Street Jour
nal reporter and bureau chief for
South Asia as well as a husband and expecting
father. It has become commonplace to call for
the swift arrest and trial of his killers. We echo
those calls.
We join many within and without the Unit
ed States government who demand decisive
action by Pakistan's formerly terrorist-friendly
leader, General Pervez Musharraf, to capture
the terrorist ring responsible for Pearl's death.
Musharraf's determination to find and prose
cute Pearl's killers has been portrayed by some
as a test of legiumacy. It is.
Yet for us, Pearl's murder is more than a
prompt to call for justice. His death is a re
minder that, no matter how far removed
Stanford may be from the fighting in

Afghanistan or anthrax scares on the East
Coast, the U.S. campaign against terrorism
deeply affects our community.
Stanford, in turn, can affect the success of
that campaign.
"Academic" may be an adjective commonly
used to dismiss certain questions as irrelevant,
but the truth is that the knowledge and ideas
produced in our so-called Ivory Tower can
profoundly influence the decisions of our gov
ernment and direction of our society.
In the wake of Pearl's death, Stanford schol
ars — students and professors alike — should
re-dedicate themselves to ratifying the princi
ples of openness, human rights and the equal
moral value of each person on which free gov
ernments stand.
These old ideas need fresh, innovative ap
plication to circumstances and cultures very
different from those of the United States, such

as post-Taliban Afghanistan.
Stanford professors and students can help
make America's policies wise, respectful and
humane by fashioning creative ideas about the
practice of democratic freedom in societies
unlike our own.
Perhaps even more fundamentally, Stan
ford students and teachers can provide new
knowledge about the Islamic world.
Daniel Pearl's assailants were, we now know,
Islamic extremists. Pearl was a Jew, a fact his
captors apparently considered quite impor
tant. The crisis of Sept. 11 and die resulting
military campaign have brought the United
States face to face with a whole culture of Is
lamic fundamentalism hitherto unfamiliar to
most Americans.
Appallingly, there has to our knowledge
been no comprehensive academic study made
of Islamic extremism as an ideology. Militant

Islamic fundamentalism should be thoroughly
studied and researched without preconcep
tions or political inhibitions.
Further, more students should be encour
aged to learn Middle Eastern languages and, if
possible, to live and study in the region. The
government needs analysts who understand
the histories and societies of the Middle East
and the Near East. Universities, including
Stanford, need professors who have lived and
studied there and can speak to the challenges
of the region without a particular Western bias.
The discovery and dissemination of
knowledge is, as former University President
Gerhard Casper so often said, a public ser
vice. Pearl reminds us that understanding
those who violently oppose us is particularly
important in this uncertaii time.
We can honor his memory by following
his example.
