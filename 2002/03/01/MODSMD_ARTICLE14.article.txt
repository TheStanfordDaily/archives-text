## Bay Area Olympic bid a tantalizing pipe dream 
### 
£ -wive from Stanford Stadium,
welcome to the opening cere
mony of the games of the 30th
JL Joiympiad..."
Now that the Salt Lake City Olympics
have finished with barely a hitch, talk has
intensified about who will host the 2012
Summer Olympics. The Bay Area is one of
the many locations around the world vying
for the event. If it's chosen, the home of the
Cardinal will be home to the opening and
closing ceremonies of the Olympics, as well
as several athletic events.
We'll get a bigger stadium, and this
new Stanford Stadium — the place where
we will beat Cal every other year for
decades to come — will be where the Pa
rade of Nations occurs, and where what-

ever musicians happen
to be popular ten years
from now sing to the
world. The stadium will
also hold the track and
field events.
Maples will host bad
minton and the "mod
ern pentathlon" (which,
as we all of course know,
was created by Baron

Pierre de Coubertin in 1912 to test mili
tary skills).
Sunken Diamond will host softball and,
here it is again, the modern pentathlon.
Avery Aquatic Center will host water
polo — and the modern pentathlon.
Additionally, Stanford and surround
ings will be home to the Judges and Ref
erees Village and the Media Village. So
the classes of 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015
will have a good chance of getting on
television and getting (mis)quoted in
various languages.
I always though it must have been a big
deal when Stanford hosted Super Bowl
XIX (the 49ers, led by Joe Montana, beat
the Dolphins 38-16). The Olympics
would be a much, much bigger event than
that, and much, much bigger than the
Salt Lake City games, too.
Whereas the Winter Games drew
mainly those countries that have snow —
and was dominated by sports which most
of the world doesn't understand (see
curling and ice dancing), let alone par
ticipate in competitively — the Summer
Olympics are attended by virtually every
nation and have events that truly test
raw athleticism.
The San Francisco bid — some regu
lation requires that the bid have only a
city name on it, so even though it's really
a regional bid, it officially carries the
name "San Francisco" — has already
made it past one cut: four American con
tenders were knocked out of the running
last year. Now, the competition consists
of the Bay Area, Baltimore / Washington
D.C., Houston and New York.
The United States Olympic Commit

tee will choose in November one of these
four candidates to put forward to the In
ternational Olympic Committee.
If the Bay Area becomes the American
nominee, and is then, against the odds,
chosen by the 1.0.C. when it makes its de
cision in 2005, there will be seven years to
pull everything together.
Current plans call for holding events
in Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco,
Mountain View, Santa Clara, San Jose,
the Napa wine country and as far away as
Sacramento and Monterey. There could
even be soccer matches in Pasadena's
Rose Bowl or San Diego's Qualcomm
Stadium.
The Bay Area would make an excellent
Olympic choice. The weather is perfect,
the environment is beautiful, the people
are friendly and we are used to hosting
people from all over the world — we're
already set up to provide any type of cui
sine and cultural entertainment a visiting
athlete could want.
From an environmental point of view,
the world would save some transporta
tion-related pollution by allowing the
many Stanford student-athlete
Olympians to compete on their home turf
(those athletes are now in the fifth grade
or so, playing handball on their elemen
tary school playground).
From the journalists' point of view,
it's a good choice (ignoring that the
Media Village might include Stern Hall)
because there's plenty of interesting ma
terial here for international, and even
East Coast journalists, to report on. In
teresting people, too. In Sydney, the
Aborigines were a big story. In Salt Lake
City, the Mormons. Here, we have soft
ware engineers.
There are a variety of picturesque
backdrops around, from the Golden
Gate Bridge to the redwood forests to
Memorial Church.
Despite such irresistible lures, the
Bay Area is considered by many to be a
long shot.
A big reason for this is that the U.S.
was the host in 1996 and again this year,
making it unlikely that it will be chosen
again soon (1.0.C. Vice President Vitaly
Smirnov of Russia has said the Olympics
should return to America "once in forev
er"). Potential international competition
for 2012 includes Rome, Paris, London,
Moscow, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro and a
yet-to-be-determined African city.
I think it's about time the Olympics are
held outside the richest regions of the
world, but still, it would be nice to have
the Olympics right here and be able to see
the Olympic flame burning at Stanford . .
. and, of course, the modern pentathlon.
