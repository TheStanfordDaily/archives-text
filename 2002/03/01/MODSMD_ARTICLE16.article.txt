## Cardinal downs Arizona 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Down the stretch, the players
on Stanford's bench litiked arms.
Nobody needed to tell them how important this
game was or to remind them how much the odds
were stacked against them.
'Hie last urne Stanford won two games in a row in
Tucson was in 1955 and until last night's win, Arizona
coach Lute Olson was 16-1 lifetime against the Cardi
nal at the McKale Center.
So when the game was on the line, and Tony Gio
vacchini, Curtis Borchardt and Teyo Johnson stood
at the free-throw line to put the game out of reach, the
bench was united as one.

Thursday: No. 17 Stanford 76, No. 15
Arizona 71

It was a fitting sight, considering how many Cardi
nal players played pivotal roles in No. 17 Stanford's
(18-8,11-6 Pacific 10 Conference) 76-71 upset victory
over No. 14 Arizona (18-9, 11-6) last night.
"We just played so much better as a team. Every
body contributed," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Josh [Childress] came off the bench
well, Joe [Kirchofer] came off the bench. Curtis was
huge down the stretch. Justin Davis gave us a huge lift

off the boards. It was just a great team effort."
Despite not recording his 15th double-double of
the season, junior center Borchardt was instrumental
as he scored a team-high 28 points, including going
11 of 11 from the line and collecting nine rebounds.
A week after struggling from the free throw line,
Borchardt's free-throw conversions were definitely a
welcome sight. He attributed much of the success to
Gary King, father of women's sophomore point
guard and Borchardt's fiance, Susan King.
"He gave me some mental techniques to try and
they worked. I've also been shooting like crazy from
the line all week long," Borchardt said.
Borchardt pulled down a rebound with six seconds
to go after a missed sophomore forward Johnson free
throw Quickly fouled, Borchardt sealed the win, con
verting his two free throws.
Stanford's victory was its 18th of the season and its
11th win in the conference. But more importantly, it
will probably secure the Cardinal a berth in the NCAA
Tournament.
After a first half that saw 10 lead changes, the game
came all the way down to the wire.
Wildcats senior point guard Jason Gardner cut the
lead to 68-66 with 44 seconds left. Then, using a full
court press, Arizona junior forward Rick Anderson
stole an errant pass. He then drove in fora layup to tie
the game, but was blocked. Despite pleading from the
Arizona bench, no foul was called and instead, a foul
was called on the Wildcats.
Senior point guard Giovacchini made two free
throws to give Stanford a 70-66 lead with 31 seconds left.
Gardner scored two free throws to cut the Stanford
lead to 70-68, but Borchardt countered with two more
free throws to increase the Cardinal lead to four.
After two more free throws by Borchardt, Gardner
was fouled on a 3-point attempt and converted all
three free throws to cut Stanford's lead to three.
Johnson was then fouled on the inbounds pass and
missed both free throws. Borchardt, however, pulled
down the all-important rebound.
"It was a great win for us, especially coming off of a
disappointing weekend," Montogmery said.
The victory was even more significant because ju
nior swingman Casey Jacobsen scored only six points,
only the second game this season that he has been lim
ited to single-digit scoring. Jacobsen was 2 of 7 from
the field and missed six minutes of tjie game tending
to a cut above his right eye.
A game after the usual suspects had gone 14 of 42
from 3-point land, Montgomery turned to reserves
for some help on the wing.
Sophomore guard Matt Lottich, who played seven
first-half minutes, scored on his first two field goal at
tempts, a 3-pointer and then a baseline runner that
gave the Cardinal a 20-18 lead.
Gardner, who finished with a game-high 33 points,
scored 20 points in the first half, including 4 of 5 3-
pointers.
The Cardinal's intensity was much greater than ei
ther of the two matchups against the Los Angeles
schools last week.
Jacobsen moved to fourth on the all-time Stanford
scoring list with 1,636 career points. He passed Dion
Cross, who scored 1,635 from 1993-96.

throw Quickly fouled, Borchardt sealed the win, con
verting his two free throws.
Stanford's victory was its 18th of the season and its
11th win in the conference. But more importantly, it
will probably secure the Cardinal a berth in the NCAA
Tournament.
After a first half that saw 10 lead changes, the game
came all the way down to the wire.
Wildcats senior point guard Jason Gardner cut the
lead to 68-66 with 44 seconds left. Then, using a full
court press, Arizona junior forward Rick Anderson
stole an errant pass. He then drove in fora layup to tie
the game, but was blocked. Despite pleading from the
Arizona bench, no foul was called and instead, a foul
was called on the Wildcats.
Senior point guard Giovacchini made two free
throws to give Stanford a 70-66 lead with 31 seconds left.
Gardner scored two free throws to cut the Stanford
lead to 70-68, but Borchardt countered with two more
free throws to increase the Cardinal lead to four.
After two more free throws by Borchardt, Gardner
was fouled on a 3-point attempt and converted all
three free throws to cut Stanford's lead to three.
Johnson was then fouled on the inbounds pass and
missed both free throws. Borchardt, however, pulled
down the all-important rebound.
"It was a great win for us, especially coming off of a
disappointing weekend," Montogmery said.
The victory was even more significant because ju
nior swingman Casey Jacobsen scored only six points,
only the second game this season that he has been lim
ited to single-digit scoring. Jacobsen was 2 of 7 from
the field and missed six minutes of tjie game tending
to a cut above his right eye.
A game after the usual suspects had gone 14 of 42
from 3-point land, Montgomery turned to reserves
for some help on the wing.
Sophomore guard Matt Lottich, who played seven
first-half minutes, scored on his first two field goal at
tempts, a 3-pointer and then a baseline runner that
gave the Cardinal a 20-18 lead.
Gardner, who finished with a game-high 33 points,
scored 20 points in the first half, including 4 of 5 3-
pointers.
The Cardinal's intensity was much greater than ei
ther of the two matchups against the Los Angeles
schools last week.
Jacobsen moved to fourth on the all-time Stanford
scoring list with 1,636 career points. He passed Dion
Cross, who scored 1,635 from 1993-96.

TUCSON, Ariz. — Down the stretch, the players
on Stanford's bench litiked arms.
Nobody needed to tell them how important this
game was or to remind them how much the odds
were stacked against them.
'Hie last urne Stanford won two games in a row in
Tucson was in 1955 and until last night's win, Arizona
coach Lute Olson was 16-1 lifetime against the Cardi
nal at the McKale Center.
So when the game was on the line, and Tony Gio
vacchini, Curtis Borchardt and Teyo Johnson stood
at the free-throw line to put the game out of reach, the
bench was united as one.

Thursday: No. 17 Stanford 76, No. 15
Arizona 71

It was a fitting sight, considering how many Cardi
nal players played pivotal roles in No. 17 Stanford's
(18-8,11-6 Pacific 10 Conference) 76-71 upset victory
over No. 14 Arizona (18-9, 11-6) last night.
"We just played so much better as a team. Every
body contributed," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Josh [Childress] came off the bench
well, Joe [Kirchofer] came off the bench. Curtis was
huge down the stretch. Justin Davis gave us a huge lift

off the boards. It was just a great team effort."
Despite not recording his 15th double-double of
the season, junior center Borchardt was instrumental
as he scored a team-high 28 points, including going
11 of 11 from the line and collecting nine rebounds.
A week after struggling from the free throw line,
Borchardt's free-throw conversions were definitely a
welcome sight. He attributed much of the success to
Gary King, father of women's sophomore point
guard and Borchardt's fiance, Susan King.
"He gave me some mental techniques to try and
they worked. I've also been shooting like crazy from
the line all week long," Borchardt said.
Borchardt pulled down a rebound with six seconds
to go after a missed sophomore forward Johnson free
