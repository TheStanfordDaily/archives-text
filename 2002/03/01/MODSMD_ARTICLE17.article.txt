# Team overcomes financial burden
## Wrestling succeeds as it takes on fundraising and tough opponents 
### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Among all the things that set the Stan
ford wrestling team apart from its oppo
nents heading into the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships this weekend, there
is one that might come as a surprise.
"We're the only Pac-10 wrestling
school that fundraises almost our entire
operating budget," said head coach Steve
Buddie. "If we want to travel or recruit,
we pretty much have to raise the money
on our own."
Stanford (10-8,3-4 Pac-10) proved it is
capable of achieving a great deal— post
ing its first winning season since 1991 —
despite the burden that nominal scholar
ships place on the team's

ability to recruit the nation's top talent.
"Even though Stanford has some
strong financial aid for certain individu
als who qualify, it's still hard to convince
a blue-chip athlete, who very much de
serves a full scholarship, to come here on
financial aid only," Buddie said.
Thankful that funding for the
wrestling program was not cut entirely as
a result of Title IX, the last thing this
team wants is pity. Instead, the program
has learned to be content with the finan
cial aspects it can't control while striving
for more on the mat.
As Stanford competes in the pinnacle
of its already commendable season this
weekend, the team can take another step
towards establishing itself as a respected,
top-notch program, truly founded on
dedication and a love for the sport.
"I think it's especially important for
the team to earn some more respect and
this is the place to do it," redshirt fresh
man Brad Metzler said.
The two-day double-elimination

tournament, which starts Saturday at
Oregon State, is an opportunity for
some team members to prove their per
formances during the regular season
were no fluke. For others, the spotlight is
a chance for redemption after failing to
meet personal goals.
The tournament also has great ramifi
cations for the future of the Stanford
wrestling program as a whole.
"No matter what level of funding
you have in your program, anytime you
can show that you're competitive in
your conference and you have compet
itive individuals, it helps recruiting,"
Buddie said.
Stanford finished ninth at last year's
I'ac-10 Championships after going 4-9 in
the regular season and losing all six of its
meets against conference foes.
The outcome figures to be better this
year as several Stanford wrestlers will be
seeded highly. The top four finishers in

Redshirt freshman Matt Gentry is rid
ing a 14-match win streak that closed out
a phenomenal regular season that in
cluded 32 wins overall, 16 dual meet vic
tories and 4 pins — all team highs.
Metzler won the starting spot and
posted 14 wins at 141 pounds. Al
though his weight class is considered to
be the toughest in the Pac-10, Metzler
hopes to make a splash in his first post
season action.
"I have a game plan," Metzler said.
"Mentally I'll stay focused just like I have
all season, but I also have to be a little
more conscious of the importance of it."

joyed successful seasons. In his final sea

Weikel-Magden recorded 25 wins for the
Cardinal, including 13 in dual meets

after moving up two weight classes
to 157 pounds. At 285, senior
Brad Selby had eight wins during
the regular season and has won
five of his last six matches.
Juniors Justin Walker and
Harold Penson will wrestle at 133
and 188 pounds, respectively.
Walker led the team in wins last
season and Penson was a sixth

place finisher at last year's Pac-10
tournament.
Rounding out Stanford's start

Twomey (197 pounds), John
Garfinkel (165) and Nathan Peter

Kharbush (174).
"We've got a lot of guys right
now who are wrestling well," Met

we've had in a long time so we
have a lot of motivation and con

tournament."

Juniors Justin Walker and
Harold Penson will wrestle at 133
and 188 pounds, respectively.
Walker led the team in wins last
season and Penson was a sixth

place finisher at last year's Pac-10
tournament.
Rounding out Stanford's start
ing ten are sophomores Matt
Twomey (197 pounds), John
Garfinkel (165) and Nathan Peter
son (125) and freshman Imad
Kharbush (174).
"We've got a lot of guys right
now who are wrestling well," Met
zler said. "This is the best season
we've had in a long time so we
have a lot of motivation and con
fidence heading into this final
tournament."
Among all the things that set the Stan
ford wrestling team apart from its oppo
nents heading into the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships this weekend, there
is one that might come as a surprise.
"We're the only Pac-10 wrestling
school that fundraises almost our entire
operating budget," said head coach Steve
Buddie. "If we want to travel or recruit,
we pretty much have to raise the money
on our own."
Stanford (10-8,3-4 Pac-10) proved it is
capable of achieving a great deal— post
ing its first winning season since 1991 —
despite the burden that nominal scholar
ships place on the team's

ability to recruit the nation's top talent.
"Even though Stanford has some
strong financial aid for certain individu
als who qualify, it's still hard to convince
a blue-chip athlete, who very much de
serves a full scholarship, to come here on
financial aid only," Buddie said.
Thankful that funding for the
wrestling program was not cut entirely as
a result of Title IX, the last thing this
team wants is pity. Instead, the program
has learned to be content with the finan
cial aspects it can't control while striving
for more on the mat.
As Stanford competes in the pinnacle
of its already commendable season this
weekend, the team can take another step
towards establishing itself as a respected,
top-notch program, truly founded on
dedication and a love for the sport.
"I think it's especially important for
the team to earn some more respect and
this is the place to do it," redshirt fresh
man Brad Metzler said.
The two-day double-elimination

tournament, which starts Saturday at
Oregon State, is an opportunity for
some team members to prove their per
formances during the regular season
were no fluke. For others, the spotlight is
a chance for redemption after failing to
meet personal goals.
The tournament also has great ramifi
cations for the future of the Stanford
wrestling program as a whole.
"No matter what level of funding
you have in your program, anytime you
can show that you're competitive in
your conference and you have compet
itive individuals, it helps recruiting,"
Buddie said.
Stanford finished ninth at last year's
I'ac-10 Championships after going 4-9 in
the regular season and losing all six of its
meets against conference foes.
The outcome figures to be better this
year as several Stanford wrestlers will be
seeded highly. The top four finishers in
each weight class plus one wildcard qual
ify for the NCAA Championships March
15-17 in Albany, NY.
Redshirt freshman Matt Gentry is rid
ing a 14-match win streak that closed out
a phenomenal regular season that in
cluded 32 wins overall, 16 dual meet vic
tories and 4 pins — all team highs.
Metzler won the starting spot and
posted 14 wins at 141 pounds. Al
though his weight class is considered to
be the toughest in the Pac-10, Metzler
hopes to make a splash in his first post
season action.
"I have a game plan," Metzler said.
"Mentally I'll stay focused just like I have
all season, but I also have to be a little
more conscious of the importance of it."

joyed successful seasons. In his final sea
