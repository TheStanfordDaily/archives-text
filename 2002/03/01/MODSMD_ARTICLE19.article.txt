# Softball readies for tourney
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
l he No. 3 Stanford softball team (13-2) will pack its
bags once again this weekend for the third in a series of
four tournaments held around the nation. This week
the Cardinal is headed for the Red Desert Classic in St.
George, Utah.
Stanford enters the tournament eager to see what it
is capable of.
"In our first two tournaments we were getting to
know who we are as a team," senior outfielder Jessica
Mendoza said. "Now we know who we are and we want
to see what we can do."
Stanford spent the last week at its highest ranking in
the program's history but Wednesday the team
dropped from the two spot back down to the No. 3
team in the nation after suffering two losses this week
end. The Cardinal dropped games against No. 25
Massachusetts and No. 9 Nebraska at the NFCA Lead
off Classic.
This weekend, the Cardinal will compete in a pool
play style of tournament where it will face UNLV (9-9),
Eastern Kentucky (5-2), Southern Utah (9-9), UC-Santa
Barbara and Utah (7-19).

Stanford is not a newcomer in St. George, as the
tourney has become a fixture of the Cardinal's presea
son journey. The Stanford squad holds a 9-0 overall
record at the Red Desert Classic.
The Cardinal will kick off the tournament by taking
on UNLV, which is riding a four-game losing streak.
The second game of the day will feature Eastern Ken
tucky. The Colonels enter the tournament after a run
ner-up finish at the Mercer Classic.
The Cardinal's third opponent of the tournament,
Southern Uuih will be eager to continue its winning
streak. It snapped its own four-game losing streak when
it swept a doubleheader last week against Utah Stale.
Later that day, Stanford will take the field against the
Gauchos of UC-Santa Barbara. The Cardinal has not
yet faced the Gauchos, but both teams competed at the
Campbell / Carrier Classic, which Stanford won. UC
Santa Barbara is just 3-7 in its last 10 games despite
blanking Santa Clara 2-0 in its last game.
Finally, the Cardinal will face Utah, who is hitting just
.217 on tiie season and has lost 10 of 11 games. Utah will
be out to gain respect and take a win from the Cardinal,
the highest-ranked opponent a the Desert Classic.
The Cardinal will look to pro
duce at the plate this weekend. In its
two losses in Georgia, Stanford's
pitching was strong, but the hot bats
of earlier games were not present.
The Cardinal will try to follow
the lead of senior first baseman
Sarah Beeson, who is currently at

the top of the offensive charts. The
Ail-American leads the squad with a
.500 batting average, 20 hits, five
doubles, 13 RBI, 28 total bases, a
.700 slugging percentage and a .608
on-base percentage.
Also providing consistency in the
box is three-time Ail-American
Mendoza who has started all 15
games so far and is hitting .319 with
15 runs scored, 12 RBI and six
steals. Mendoza is continuing where
she left off. In the 2001 season she

led the Cardinal with a .405 average
in 71 games started. She also led
Stanford with 70 runs, 83 hits, 14
home runs, 151 total bases, a .737
slugging percentage, a .504 on-base
percentage and 31 stolen bases.
Stanford will lean on Beeson
and Mendoza for leadership and
production, but the Cardinal needs
the contribution of the entire team
to shake off last weekend's losses as
it heads into its third preseason
tournament.
