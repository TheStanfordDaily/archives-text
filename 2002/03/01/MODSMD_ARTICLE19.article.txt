### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
l he No. 3 Stanford softball team (13-2) will pack its
bags once again this weekend for the third in a series of
four tournaments held around the nation. This week
the Cardinal is headed for the Red Desert Classic in St.
George, Utah.
Stanford enters the tournament eager to see what it
is capable of.
"In our first two tournaments we were getting to
know who we are as a team," senior outfielder Jessica
Mendoza said. "Now we know who we are and we want
to see what we can do."
Stanford spent the last week at its highest ranking in
the program's history but Wednesday the team
dropped from the two spot back down to the No. 3
team in the nation after suffering two losses this week
end. The Cardinal dropped games against No. 25
Massachusetts and No. 9 Nebraska at the NFCA Lead
off Classic.
This weekend, the Cardinal will compete in a pool
play style of tournament where it will face UNLV (9-9),
Eastern Kentucky (5-2), Southern Utah (9-9), UC-Santa
Barbara and Utah (7-19).

Stanford is not a newcomer in St. George, as the
tourney has become a fixture of the Cardinal's presea
son journey. The Stanford squad holds a 9-0 overall
record at the Red Desert Classic.
The Cardinal will kick off the tournament by taking
on UNLV, which is riding a four-game losing streak.
The second game of the day will feature Eastern Ken
tucky. The Colonels enter the tournament after a run
ner-up finish at the Mercer Classic.
The Cardinal's third opponent of the tournament,
Southern Uuih will be eager to continue its winning
streak. It snapped its own four-game losing streak when
it swept a doubleheader last week against Utah Stale.
Later that day, Stanford will take the field against the
Gauchos of UC-Santa Barbara. The Cardinal has not
yet faced the Gauchos, but both teams competed at the
Campbell / Carrier Classic, which Stanford won. UC
Santa Barbara is just 3-7 in its last 10 games despite
blanking Santa Clara 2-0 in its last game.
Finally, the Cardinal will face Utah, who is hitting just
.217 on tiie season and has lost 10 of 11 games. Utah will
be out to gain respect and take a win from the Cardinal,
the highest-ranked opponent a the Desert Classic.
