# Cardinal searches for reliable third starter
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If it's not a serious problem yet, then it's
certainly getting there. One month into the
baseball season, top-ranked Stanford con
tinues to search fora third starter to com
plement the outstanding duo of juniors Je
remy Guthrie and Tim Cunningham. So
far, no good.
The No. I Cardinal (9-4) has won all
nine games that either Guthrie or Cun
ningham has started this year on the
strength of their combined 6-0 record and
2.96 KRA in the early going. On the other
hand, the arms auditioning for the third

starter role — which head coach Mark
Marquess said he preferred to have settled
by March — have struggled. Neither of the
preseason favorites, freshman Mark Jec
man (0-3,13.50 ERA) and junior Ryan Mc
(.ally (0-0, 5.79), has stepped to the fore,
and what could he the Cardinal's most im
portant role come Pacific 10 Conference
season is yet to be determined.
So, is Marquess concerned?
"I'm concerned about everything/' he
said. "Ihere really isn't a phase of the game
where we are really playing well and there's
a lot of room for improvement in all areas."
