# Cardinal searches for reliable third starter
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If it's not a serious problem yet, then it's
certainly getting there. One month into the
baseball season, top-ranked Stanford con
tinues to search fora third starter to com
plement the outstanding duo of juniors Je
remy Guthrie and Tim Cunningham. So
far, no good.
The No. I Cardinal (9-4) has won all
nine games that either Guthrie or Cun
ningham has started this year on the
strength of their combined 6-0 record and
2.96 KRA in the early going. On the other
hand, the arms auditioning for the third

starter role — which head coach Mark
Marquess said he preferred to have settled
by March — have struggled. Neither of the
preseason favorites, freshman Mark Jec
man (0-3,13.50 ERA) and junior Ryan Mc
(.ally (0-0, 5.79), has stepped to the fore,
and what could he the Cardinal's most im
portant role come Pacific 10 Conference
season is yet to be determined.
So, is Marquess concerned?
"I'm concerned about everything/' he
said. "Ihere really isn't a phase of the game
where we are really playing well and there's
a lot of room for improvement in all areas."

Junior Tim Cunningham hurls a pitch. Cunningham and fellow junior, Jeremy Guthrie, have
secured spots in the rotation, but the Cardinal is still searching fora third starter.
With a home weekend series
with Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo be
ginning tonight, Marquess and
Stanford still seek their first series
sweep of the season. They have al
ready discovered that it takes more
than two starters to achieve that feat.
The Mustangs (9-11-1) come
into the series having lost seven of
their last eight games, and their gen
erous pitching staff (6.55 ERA) and
relatively quiet offensive production
give the Cardinal an excellent
chance to capture all three games.
Stanford took two of three last
weekend against Santa Clara de
spite playing what Marquess called
"the poorest we've played all sea
son." It took two dramatic come
from-behind victories to salvage the

series, during which the Cardinal al
lowed 24 runs and committed seven
costly errors.
Negatives aside, Sum ford still sits
atop two of the three major polls
and has 22 days to work out its
problems until its next matchup
with a ranked opponent, a March
23 road doubleheader against No.
17 Southern California.
Junior catcher Ryan Garko,
sophomore rightfielder Carlos
Quentin and freshman designated
hitter Donny Lucy have led a mind
boggling offensive attack that has
the team scoring more than eight
runs per contest. Garko, whose
game-winning home run on Sun
day propelled the Cardinal to its sec
ond ninth-inning win in three days,
leads the team with a .429 average
and three home runs.
However, the addition of Lucy to
the Cardinal mix has perhaps been
the most significant facet of the

team's early success. His team-lead
ing 19 RBI have cemented him as a
fixture in the Stanford lineup, and he
gives Stanford a potent bat that was
not counted on prior to the season.
Tonight at 6 p.m., Lucy and the
rest of the Cardinal bats will try to
help Guthrie (3-0, 3.12) continue
his eight-game winning streak
against Mustang junior Tyler
Fitch (2-2,4.31).
After two weeks pulling up the
rear of the Stanford rotation, Cun
ningham (3-0,2.81) settles back into
his traditional Saturday starting role
tomorrow afternoon in the first of
two weekend 1 p.m. start times. Cal
Poly will give junior Nick Doan (0-2,
7.53) his first start of the season to
morrow after 10 relief appearances.
Finally, Sunday's finale will see
Marquess's search fora reliable third
arm continue with an unnamed Car
dinal starter set to go against Mus
tang senior Kevin Correia (3-1,5.24).
