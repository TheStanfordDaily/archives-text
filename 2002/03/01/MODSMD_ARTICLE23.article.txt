### 
With the clear blue sky and the glorious sunshine,
it is hard to imagine that spending Saturday on a
sailboat could be considered hard work. However,
the Stanford men's and women's sailing team won't
have much time to enjoy the weather this weekend,
as they take on some of the toughest teams in the
country as they host the Jeremy 1). Mclntyre Team
Race Intersectional this weekend at the Sailing Cen
ter in Redwood City.

EDITORS NOTEBOOK

The annual team race regatta, named for Jere
my Mclntyre '94 after his tragic death in 1999, is re
garded as the most competitive college sailing
event on the West Coast. The Cardinal will face the
likes of Boston College, University of South Flori
da, Washington, Tulane, Texas, Hawaii and South
ern California.
Coming offa seventh-place finish at the College of
Charleston Regatta last weekend, the Stanford sailers
will need strong teamwork to find success this week
end. The interesting format of the event pits three
boats from one team against three boats from anoth
er. Teams utilize rules and maneuvering strategies to
dominate their opponent.
Women's Golf
The Stanford women's golf team recorded a
ninth place finish at the three-day Wildcat Invita
tional. The Cardinal improved its day-end total
each day of the tournament with a 305 on the first

Junior Kim Rowton was the top individual per
former for the Cardinal, shooting a three-day total of
225, good fora 25th-place finish overall.
The invitational, which featured seven of the top 10
teams nationwide, served as an excellent indicator of
the talent that Stanford will have to face on the nation
al level when it resumes its season after spring break.
Duke won the event, finishing the tournament
with a 876, while Auburn and host Arizona tied for
second with an 883.
