# Rice's 'Queen' is 'Damned' indeed
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
So I figured I had the perfect angle to
take for my review of "Queen of the
Damned," the sequel to "Interview with a
Vampire." With its rock star anti-hero, the
constant hum of heavy metal in the back
ground and the nearly complete incoher
ence of its plot, how could I compare the
movie to anything other than an hour
and-a-half music video? Genius, I told my
self, genius.
But then I happened to stumble across
the entry on "Interview" in my copy of the
John Glute / John Grant "Encyclopedia of
Fantasy." It concluded, "But at the end, as
the scene slowly fades to the strains of the
Rolling Stones' 'Sympathy for the Devil,'
we realize that 'Interview with the Vam
pire' is 110 more than this: a seductive, clev
erly crafted but ultimately meaningless
rock video."

Damn.
However, I've decided that this only rein
fortes my point. If "Interview with a Vam
pire" can be described as an exercise in styl
ish moviemaking disguising a complete ab
sence of substance, then that description is
twice as fitting for "Queen of the Damned."
Except that the new film is weaker than its
predecessor in both style and substance. It
only has "Matrix"-y special effects, a sexy
performance from the late Aaliyah and lots
of Goth rock to cover up for the big gaping
hole where a compelling story, interesting
characters and intelligent ideas should be.
The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend,
channeling Bela Lugosi), after a century of
lying about and ruminating on his existential
angst with lines like, "Eternal life sounds like
a good idea until you realize that you're
going to spend it alone," decides to front a
rock band. It's not that this initial conceit
isn't clever, it just isn't fleshed out enough to

sustain an entire film. Still, I
will admit that Lestat is the ul
timate rock star — forever
young, genuinely dangerous,
intensely self-pitying and filled
with the desire to be wor
shipped by others.
From this starting point,
"Queen of the Damned"
lurches off in a dozen direc
tions, none of which make a lot
of sense, without really going
anywhere. Not surprisingly,
the film suffers from haphaz
ardly condensing Anne Rice's
"The Vampire Lestat" and

"Queen of the Damned" (two large, plot
heavy novels) into 100 minutes. The pacing
often seems hurried, the characters act in
ways that appear completely irrational and
the whole script feels really undeveloped.
The three other key players in the story
are Akasha (Aaliyah), the mother of all vam
pires, awakened by Lestat; Jesse Reeves
(Marguerite Moreau), a scholar of the occult
with a mysterious past; and Marius (Vincent
Perez), the vampire who created Lestat.

A brief detour into Le
stat's past with Marius is
the only sequence that at
tempts to capture the ho
moeroticism of "Inter
view." This is made mar
ginally interesting by its
Oedipal implications —
Marius calls Lestat "my

son," and says that Akasha is their "mother";
Lestat has kinky scenes with both of them.
Soon, however, the plot devolves into a com
petition for his affection between Jesse and
Akasha, his biggest groupies.
It's hard to care much either way, espe
cially since Moreau, ostensibly Lestat's con
nection to humanity, delivers all of Jesse's
lines in the same mind-numbing monotone.
Of course, considering the half-hearted
nature of the script, story clearly isn't what
gets director Michael Rymer's juices flow
ing. Nor, surprisingly, is it the fight scenes,
whose CGI effects seem to exist only to dis
guise the general indifference of their
choreography. The sight of dozens of vam
pires slipping lightning-fast through the un
seeing crowd at one of Lestat's concerts is far

more interesting than the overblown battle
that follows.
What really turns Ryiner on is vampires.
Not just the act of vampirism itself (although
I noticed that his vampires suck just as much
chest as neck), but the whole Goth subcul
ture that it's tied to. As the YVachowski broth
ers and others before them showed us, the
reflection of light on leather can be incredi
bly sexy. But Rymer shoves so many images
of the sheen of black leather and the glow of

pale skin — usually set
to the likes of Marilyn
Manson or the
Deftones — in our
faces that they become
the whole of the movie.
Not surprisingly,
considering the direc
tor's predilection for

Goth, nearly all of the vampires in "Queen of
the Damned" are ultra-white. In fact,
Aaliyah is the only black vampire of note,
which makes it a bit disturbing when you re
alize that she's also supposed to embody all
that's animalistic and primitive in vampires;
her modern day white kindred are the "civi
lized" ones.
This tension is in plainest view during
Aaliyah's first big scene. She walks into a
vampire bar and everyone turns to look at
her, their eyes revealing the deep suspicion
of the outsider. You can't help but notice
the contrast that Aaliyah's darkness makes
with the whiteness of every distrusting face
in the bar.
For the only time during the entire film, 1
felt a shiver run down my spine.


"Dude, being a vampire kicks ass."
