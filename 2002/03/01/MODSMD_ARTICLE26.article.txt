# Costner's 'Sixth Sense' fails again
## 
### LINDSEY GERDES 
First there was "Waterworld" and '"Hie Postman." Then
there was "3000 Miles To Graceland" and"For The Love Of
The Game." And for those viewers who perhaps thought that
the once red-hot Kevin Costner had learned his lesson once
and for all, along comes "Dragonfly" to complete the series.
In Costner's defense, the same basic strategy worked for

career. Unfortunately for Costner, besides basic plot similari
ties, the two movies bear little similarity to each other.
'TTie Sixth Sense" was so cleverly crafted that only in look
ing back could one see the necessity of every line to the over
all plot. This film's gears, on the other hand, are so painfully
exposed that the viewer constantly feels the film grinding
away to an inevitable, eye-rolling halt.
In one typical scene there is a bit of contrived dialogue
in which Costner tells friends that his dead wife's pet bird
used to announce her coming with "honey, I'm home."
Soon after, Costner comes home and — surprise, surprise
— the bird blurts out this familiar phrase, going crazy.
Gee, could it be that maybe his wife is still home, in super
natural form at least?

The basic plot isn't to blame in this movie, though, and the
material could have been explored in a far more intriguing
manner. The story revolves around Dr. Joe Harrow (Kevin
Costner), who has recently lost his pregnant wife, Emily (Su
sanna Thompson). Costner is trying to cope with both this
loss and his own feelings of guilt at not accompanying his wife
on the volunteer journey to Venezuela during which she
perished.
He begins seeing dragonflies (his wife had a fondness for
them) and wiggly cross-like symbols, and when he learns
from young cancer patients in his wife's former ward that
they've seen her in near-death experiences, he is justifiably
disturbed.
A variety of characters question Joe's sanity and frankly,
the movie would have been far more interesting if the viewer
felt there was any validity in their doubts. Instead, this pres
ence of supernatural forces is beaten into the viewer's head
with examples like the one mentioned above, and the movie
fails to keep us guessing.
'Hie film also oversteps its bounds with its strange religious
explanation of these supernatural occurrences. A mysterious
nun (Linda Hunt) gives a foggy explanation of different lev
els of consciousness and tunnels of light to assure Joe he's not
crazy. Because it takes place in a candle-filled church and
sounds confusing, the apparendy widess viewer is supposed
to interpret this explanation as being deep and meaningful,
when really it makes little sense.
The movie moves away from these half-answered ques
tions and strange occurrences in its second half and veers into
almost pure action. While this part of die film is equally ridicu
lous, it is a welcome relief to watch Costner do something more

than move from sad, tortured face to scared, tortured face.
There is also a sentimental "surprise" ending that is well
worthy of Tom Shadyac, the man who directed "Patch
Adams."
Through it all though, 1 have to admit it 1 was mildly
entertained. It took an incredible suspension of disbelief,
but I admit to even jumping at a few of the scarier mo
ments. Though I hardly recommend the film, if you have
nothing better to do on a dreary Saturday afternoon and
you're in an incredibly gullible mood, you might just tol
erate it as well.


I like it when you wear this costume.
