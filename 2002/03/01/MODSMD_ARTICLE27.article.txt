# 'Girls' launch new, intimate tour
## 
### JENNIE KIM 
After seeing Emily Saliers and Amy Ray, better
known as the Indigo Girls, perform live two weeks ago
at Slim's, a small, dark nightclub in San Francisco, it is
clear that they don't consider themselves to be the fa
mous, multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning
recording artists that they are. Dressed comfortably in
casual shirts and loose slacks, they were refreshingly free
of the ego that typically accompanies music stardom.
Saliers is a self-proclaimed "big fan" of women's Car
dinal basketball. "I am so proud of the Stanford
women's basketball team right now," she announces be
fore any "official" interview questions are asked.
On stage for only an hour, the Indigo Girls mesmer
ized a silent crowd with all-new material from their lat
est album, "Become You." About 300 avid fans, most fe
male, packed the standing-room-only floor shoulder to
shoulder. Slim's is about one-tenth the size of the
venues that the Indigo Girls are capable of filling, yet
the intimate atmosphere lit the simple, casual theme of
the show.
To be released on March 12th, "Become You" is their
Bth studio album and has a sound that Saliers described
as "organic," adding that it is "primarily acoustic with a
straightforward purity to it." The decision to record an
acoustic album had been in the works "fora long time
now," she said. She and Ray were just waiting for the
right material to work with.
They found the perfect mix when composing "Be
come You," a pared-down departure from 1999's elec
tronic-influenced, guest-filled "Come On Now Social."
Recorded in their hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, "Be
come You" relies primarily on acoustics and vocals with
a few tracks even cut live.

The live aspect "captures a certain vibe and intensi
ty," Salieras explained. "Even with pitch problems and
slight mistakes, it's still better than surgically fixing
everything." Working in their hometown also gave the
music a sense of authenticity and"a real spirit," she said,
"and it's comfortable to sleep in your own bed at night."
This comfort and spontaneity is palpable in the ma
terial of the album. "Moment of Forgiveness," the
opening track and first single, is infectiously straight
forward. Written in 10 minutes by Ray who was sud
denly inspired backstage during a previous show, it ex
plores the conditions that influence a reunion between
former loves.
The lyrics begin immediately with the music —
"Well I guess that I was lonely / That's why 1 called you
on the phone / 'Cause in a moment of forgiveness /1
didn't want to be alone . . . Guess that I was hoping /
That you'd finally understand / And in a moment of
forgiveness / You'd reach out and take my hand."
These suggestive lyrics do not specifically refer to the
two-year break the Indigo Girls had after "Come On
Now Social" while Ray promoted her solo album, ap
propriately titled "Stag." Instead, Emily said, it deals
with a "personal situation" of Amy's that had "nothing
to do with us."
Ray wrote half of the 12 tracks on the album, Saliers
the other half. Each song has a meaning that goes be
yond the words. "You can't separate social conscience
from life," Saliers explained. "Activity springs from
your concern from different issues, it's part of being
part of a community." She wrote "Our Deliverance" to
serve as a commentary of the events of Sept. 11 and her
opinion about war:
"They're sending soldiers to distant places / X's and
O's on someone's drawing board / Light green and

plastic with human faces / And they want
to tell you it's a merciful sword."
The title track also has a social message,
Emily said, "It's about racism in the South,
heritage and how people can get along de
spite differences." Written by Amy, "Be
come You" pleads for empathy, even for
those who are intolerant — "I'm sorry for
what you have learned / When you feel the
tables turn / To run so hard in your race /
Now you find you set the pace...lt's okay,
long time to / Become the thing I am to
you / And you won't tear it apart / Without
a fight, without a heart."
Their latest political campaign con
cerns the transportation of nuclear
waste to Yucca Mountain, Nevada, a
land that is considered sacred by native
people. Emily called this a "critical situ
ation" because it is "both a health risk
and an environmental justice issue."
The girls are currently in the process of
determining how to defeat the proposal,
and more information will be added to
their Web site, www.indigogirls.com, as
soon as it is available.
Their trademark consciousness lends
depth and innovation to "Become You,"
and the meaning of their lyrics are ampli
fied by the album's clean, simple style.
However, this isn't to say that there are no
other inventive qualities in their music.
"You've Got to Show" is the Indigo
Girls' first attempt at infusing a Latin/jazz
vibe into their music. They were hesitant
to add new instruments to the song at first,
Emily admitted, "We said, 'No way' —
never a sax solo. No way — no strings.' But
(producer) Peter Collins had a vision that
we really think was right."
The duo's reputation for acoustic skill
and amazing harmonies are well deserved
and shine in their performance. "Become

You" perfectly captures the basics that they have long
since mastered. Still, they realize that they have changed
greatly since their studio debut in 1989.
At 38, Saliers now jokingly calls herself and Ray "old
ladies," but feels their maturity is discernible in this
record. "Hopefully the songs are more mature, they're
growing. Your perspective changes as you get older.
Hopefully we are growing as songwriters and as musi
cians." After a pause, she adds, "I think we are."
The Indigo Girls maintain their fresh, always evolv
ing sound by trying to preserve the joy they find in their
music and in their performances. "We don't tour to
death," Saliers explained. "Every night we change the
set list, and we don't play what we don't want to play."
They opted to play smaller venues for this tour be
cause "it gave us a chance to play the music live, and the
energy was more concentrated," Saliers said. She called
the promo tour "cushy" and promised to tour larger
venues later this year. Until then, the Indigo Girls will
trek across the rest of the country for another month,
living in a tour bus, and perhaps watching a few lady
Card basketball games on the road.

more intimate venues.
