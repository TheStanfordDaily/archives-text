# Bust me some Sevendust, baby!

### STEPHEN VIGIL 
The subtlest moments in life are often the ones that stick
with you the most. I remember sitting in my high school senior
year English class 3 years ago. The teacher let us "free-write"
for 5 minutes and students were free to bring in music to sub
ject the class to.
My teacher, being the burned-out hippie she was, had no
reaction as "Black" by Sevendust suddenly blared through the
speakers. As I looked around the room, though, some of my
classmates were playing air guitar. My friend Dave was sitting
in the corner making funny faces as he imitated the typical
metal bassist, when the teacher looked up from her work and
prompdy told him to return to his writing. I smirked and con
tinued to jot down my thoughts.
Sevendust is one of the better heavy-metal bands out there
today but as I sat in class, I could not have foreseen their tu
multuous future or that I'd be interviewing them today.
The Fillmore in downtown San Francisco hosted Seven
dust on Feb. 18. The venue has rocked the Bay Area since the
sixties, hosting some of the biggest acts of the last 30 years. Jef
ferson Airplane, for example, got its start at the cozy venue —
complete with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, balconies
and a hardwood dance floor. Its limited capacity also makes
fora very intimate concert going experience.
I had a chance to interview bassist Vince Hornsby before
the show. Calmly slumping into a black leather couch with a
l>eanie on his head and cigarette behind his ear, he spoke with
a Southern drawl. His demeanor was one of Southern hospi
tality, though he often gave evasive answers to my rather
pointed questions.
The main subject of discussion was Sevendust's new album,
"Animosity." The record is a bit of a departure from previous
Sevendust albums in thai it focuses more on songwriting than
ever before. "I believe we had time to live with this record and
we took a longer time recording it and writing the songs,"
Hornsby explained, "We're really digging it, man! We want
ed to put some melody on it and let L.j. [vocalist Lajon With
erspoon] do his thing."
Anyone who listens to "Animosity" will notice the amount
of religious imagery that songs such as "X-mas Day " "Cruci
fied" and "Praise" contain. According to Hornsby, "There
ain't really a religious point about it. 'X-mas Day' is about

something that happened to Clint [guitarist] on Christmas
Day when he wrote that song. 'Crucified' was about a rela
tionship we had with somebody." In the liner notes, though,
all but one of the band members thank Cod. To that, he
replied, "We're kind of a religious band, we are that. But the
songs have nothing to do with religion."
As for the often-morbid gothic imagery in the songs,

Hornsby said, "Well,
there are certainly
songs on our new
record that are not real
ly uplifting songs. It's
according to how you
want to take them.
They're uplifting to us
because we were vent
ing our frustrations out
on the industry and
whatnot and our past
experiences with peo
ple [when we wrote
them]. We're definitely
not a morbid band,
there's nothing about
us that dwells on any of
that stuff". A lot of peo
ple think heavy music is
just dark and et cetera.
Screw all that! That
ain't what it is — not to
us anyway."
Though there is cer
tainly a cathartic quality
to the songwriting on
this record, Hornsby

correctly observed that people perceive songs in different
ways, which made me ask him how he felt about people who
stereotype Sevendust's heavy music as negative.
"You know everybody's got their opinion about every
thing, but don't judge a book by its cover. A lot of people think
we're scary or whatever, but then they meet us and say, 'Well,
they're just normal dudes,"' Hornsby replied. Perhaps more
tellingly, he adds, "It's just music, man. Nobody has to listen to

it. If they don't want to listen to it, just turn it off."
It's a response you'd expect from a band that has endured
plenty of hardships, including going broke after releasing two
albums, as well as drug and alcohol difficulties. According to
Hornsby, experiences such as diose shaped die material on
"Animosity."
Hornsby reasoned, "We toured two years straight without

coming off the road,
which was rough on us.
The next cycle came
around and this record
here was about what we
lived through the last two
years. It's definitely
about life experiences
and we just happened to
be the subject matter."
At the concert, Sev
endust started off with
its hit "Black" and then
continued by playing
songs off its new album.
In a break between
songs, vocalist Wither
spoon addressed the
crowd, thanking them
for supporting the
slight change of course,
saying, "We realized we
don't have to be the
heaviest shit in the
land." While the re
mark engendered
mostly cheering, you
could feel the disap-

pointment of some of the hard-core fans, especially when
the band played the pensive ballad "Angel's Son," dedicat
ed to a deceased friend.
Witherspoon's remarks definitely reflect the trajectory of
the band. It would be unfair to say that the band has softened
up, though. Sevendust's intensity and vigor remained high
throughout a diverse and satisfy ing show — a true testament
to the band's musical and personal evolution.

to the songwriting on
this record, Hornsby

correctly observed that people perceive songs in different
ways, which made me ask him how he felt about people who
stereotype Sevendust's heavy music as negative.
"You know everybody's got their opinion about every
thing, but don't judge a book by its cover. A lot of people think
we're scary or whatever, but then they meet us and say, 'Well,
they're just normal dudes,"' Hornsby replied. Perhaps more
tellingly, he adds, "It's just music, man. Nobody has to listen to

it. If they don't want to listen to it, just turn it off."
It's a response you'd expect from a band that has endured
plenty of hardships, including going broke after releasing two
albums, as well as drug and alcohol difficulties. According to
Hornsby, experiences such as diose shaped die material on
"Animosity."
Hornsby reasoned, "We toured two years straight without

coming off the road,
which was rough on us.
The next cycle came
around and this record
here was about what we
lived through the last two
years. It's definitely
about life experiences
and we just happened to
be the subject matter."
At the concert, Sev
endust started off with
its hit "Black" and then
continued by playing
songs off its new album.
In a break between
songs, vocalist Wither
spoon addressed the
crowd, thanking them
for supporting the
slight change of course,
saying, "We realized we
don't have to be the
heaviest shit in the
land." While the re
mark engendered
mostly cheering, you
could feel the disap-

pointment of some of the hard-core fans, especially when
the band played the pensive ballad "Angel's Son," dedicat
ed to a deceased friend.
Witherspoon's remarks definitely reflect the trajectory of
the band. It would be unfair to say that the band has softened
up, though. Sevendust's intensity and vigor remained high
throughout a diverse and satisfy ing show — a true testament
to the band's musical and personal evolution.


"We realized we don't have fo be the heaviest shit in the land."
The subtlest moments in life are often the ones that stick
with you the most. I remember sitting in my high school senior
year English class 3 years ago. The teacher let us "free-write"
for 5 minutes and students were free to bring in music to sub
ject the class to.
My teacher, being the burned-out hippie she was, had no
reaction as "Black" by Sevendust suddenly blared through the
speakers. As I looked around the room, though, some of my
classmates were playing air guitar. My friend Dave was sitting
in the corner making funny faces as he imitated the typical
metal bassist, when the teacher looked up from her work and
prompdy told him to return to his writing. I smirked and con
tinued to jot down my thoughts.
Sevendust is one of the better heavy-metal bands out there
today but as I sat in class, I could not have foreseen their tu
multuous future or that I'd be interviewing them today.
The Fillmore in downtown San Francisco hosted Seven
dust on Feb. 18. The venue has rocked the Bay Area since the
sixties, hosting some of the biggest acts of the last 30 years. Jef
ferson Airplane, for example, got its start at the cozy venue —
complete with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, balconies
and a hardwood dance floor. Its limited capacity also makes
fora very intimate concert going experience.
I had a chance to interview bassist Vince Hornsby before
the show. Calmly slumping into a black leather couch with a
l>eanie on his head and cigarette behind his ear, he spoke with
a Southern drawl. His demeanor was one of Southern hospi
tality, though he often gave evasive answers to my rather
pointed questions.
The main subject of discussion was Sevendust's new album,
"Animosity." The record is a bit of a departure from previous
Sevendust albums in thai it focuses more on songwriting than
ever before. "I believe we had time to live with this record and
we took a longer time recording it and writing the songs,"
Hornsby explained, "We're really digging it, man! We want
ed to put some melody on it and let L.j. [vocalist Lajon With
erspoon] do his thing."
Anyone who listens to "Animosity" will notice the amount
of religious imagery that songs such as "X-mas Day " "Cruci
fied" and "Praise" contain. According to Hornsby, "There
ain't really a religious point about it. 'X-mas Day' is about

something that happened to Clint [guitarist] on Christmas
Day when he wrote that song. 'Crucified' was about a rela
tionship we had with somebody." In the liner notes, though,
all but one of the band members thank Cod. To that, he
replied, "We're kind of a religious band, we are that. But the
songs have nothing to do with religion."
As for the often-morbid gothic imagery in the songs,

Hornsby said, "Well,
there are certainly
songs on our new
record that are not real
ly uplifting songs. It's
according to how you
want to take them.
They're uplifting to us
because we were vent
ing our frustrations out
on the industry and
whatnot and our past
experiences with peo
ple [when we wrote
them]. We're definitely
not a morbid band,
there's nothing about
us that dwells on any of
that stuff". A lot of peo
ple think heavy music is
just dark and et cetera.
Screw all that! That
ain't what it is — not to
us anyway."
