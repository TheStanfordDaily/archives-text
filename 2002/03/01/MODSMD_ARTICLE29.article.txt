# Guerrero fuses influences nicely

### KAREEM GHANEM 
People might argue over whether or
not skateboarding is an actual sport per
se. However, even if you don't believe it
belongs in the realm of track, basketball
and hockey, you have to admit that like
other athletes, there comes a time when
all skateboarders must hang up their

decks and find something else to do.
How do they occupy themselves from
the age of 25 onward? If they're Tommy
Guerrero, they go on to a career as a mu
sician. The San Franciscan artist and co
founder of Real Skateboards is well
known for his prominence as a skate

boarder in the mid - to late - '80s.
A caveat is certainly in order, of course.
Just because someone is talented in one
area does not mean their talents will trans
late to other, completely unrelated, pur
suits. Take Shaquille O'Neal's joke of a rap
career, for example.
Luckily, Guerrero is no Shaq when it
comes to music. His debut album, "Little
Bit of Somethin'," was well-received and
his new El', "Junk Collector," continues in
the same jazz-inflected, funk-spiced vein.
In some ways, these five songs are a bit
of a surprise. As product of '80s skate cul
ture. one might expect Guerrero to write
stale songs steeped in speed metal (like
Slayer), anarchistic punk (like the Dead
Kennedys) or even old school rap (a la
Run-DMC).
"Junk Collector" shrugs off all these
expectations, though, and with quite a
bit of flair.
"Rusty Gears Lonely Years" intro
duces the disc with a drum beat that
would fit as the backbeat to any hip-hop
song and a slick guitar riff that echoes
'70s soul. Sounding like a slow Curtis

Mayfield song, it elicits a very sexy,
smoky and intimate ambience.
"Organism," one of the album's high

lights, is a pepped-up electronic jazz
ditty with what sounds like a synthesized
tlute keeping a heat and a recurring hazy
reggae vocal loop.
Guerrero's music isn't meant to be lis
tened to closely. Rather, each track sets a
certain mood, evoking certain feelings.
With that notion in mind, it's simple to
see how Guerrero's past as a skateboard
er plays into these creations.
In the skateboarding world, music
lias never been about lyrics or message.
Just ask skateboarding video pioneers
like Spike Jonze, who revolutionized
the genre by setting skateboarding
lootage to untraditional music like the
Jackson 5. Instead, music has tradition
ally been responsible for setting an at
mosphere and establishing an attitude
fora skate session — aggressive, re
laxed, lazy, frantic, whatever the situa
tion might call for.
While "Junk Collector" barely passes
the 20-minute mark, it still succeeds in
this respect, and it will definitely be in
teresting to see what Guerrero has up
his sleeve next.
