This week, zoot suits — the distinctive
clothing worn by Mexican Americans in
the 1940s — have hit the Stanford run
way. Showcasing different educational
and cultural activities, Zoot Suit Week,
sponsored by Casa Zapata, El Centro Chi
cano and MEChA, commemorates the
Latino American historical experience.
The week, according to organizers, is
meant to raise awareness about the Zoot
Suit Riots, which took place in Los Angeles
in the 19405.
During the post-World War II period,
Mexican Americans were the targets of
intense racial profiling, some of which
was based on their distinctive dress.
However, much of the history of the riots
has been buried.
"I think there is a real lacking in the
education of historical and cultural as
pects of Latinos in America," said sopho
more Sarita Ocon, an ethnic theme asso
ciate at Zapata.
From Feb. 24 to March 2, one event is
offered each day. The week kicked off
with a screening of Luis Valdez's film
"Zoot Suit." According to Ocon, "the
turnout for this event was amazing."
While only a few people showed up for
the movie showing in previous years,
about 40 or 50 people attended this year.
Another popular event was the Swing
and Salsa Dance Workshop hosted by Ben
Lipson, a master's student in mechanical
engineering, and SALSA!, a Stanford
based performance dance troupe.
On Monday, Prof. Alma Martinez gave
a presentation on how the exaggerated
style of the zoot suit was used to "take
something that was part of the main
stream and make it very specific to the
Latino community of the time," said se
nior Misti Rodriguez, an ETA at Zapata.
"I think it's important to enjoy learning

about the dress and the culture of the time
period but also to learn the historical rele
vance of what happened," Rodriguez said.
Ocon noted that the black communi
ty at Stanford celebrates Black History
Month and expressed the need fora
similar form of education from the Lati
no community.
"There's really not a lot of awareness on
the Stanford campus about Latino-Ameri
can history," she said.
Ocon said she feels that Zoot Suit
Week also provides an outlet for getting
different ethnic communities to come to
gether with the Latino community.
Stressing that Zoot Suit Week is not only
geared towards the Latino community,
Ocon pointed out that the people who
showed up at the events came from very
diverse backgrounds.
To introduce the history of the zoot
suit to students, History Prof. Al Camaril
lo and Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga
held a panel discussion Wednesday night
titled, "Relating Zoot Suit Era History to
the Present."
Freshman Cynthia Gomez felt that she
gained a greater appreciation of Latino-
American history by attending the discus
sion. Although she went to high school in
Los Angeles, she had never learned about
the zoot suit riots.
"I really learned about what America
was like at that time period and how peo
ple tried to focus their oppression on one
group," Gomez said.
Gomez said she was amazed that Stan
ford is one of the few universities that hosts
this event.
The speakers at the discussion en
couraged students to help spread the ed
ucation of this history.
"First it is important to be educated,"
Gomez said. "Then we need to get the
message across, to get the word out
there. We need to realize that we do have
a voice."
