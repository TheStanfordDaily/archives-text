# 'Boards' adored by hip kids

### NICK TORREY 
Buy the new Boards of Canada album, "Geogad
di," and put on the track called "1969." Then lie
down and roll around in the shaggy textures of the
many-voiced synth chords that swell up around
you, their weird partials swirling about while
strange flute-like things flit in and out and sexual
snaredrums burst like slow grapes.
By the time the Vocoded, pitch-corrected vocals
have started their sweet and slightly scary chant of
"1969 in the sunshine," you'll be head over heels
in love for sure. But when the song abruptly dies
away, you may feel a sudden spurt of shame at the
way you've just let yourself go, and you'll be sure
— just as Chip Lambert in"The Corrections"
knows he needs just one more Mexican A — that
you absolutely must hear it just one more time and
then everything will be fine.
There's a little interlude right after "1969" that
features a little kid (an important Boards of Canada
motif) reciting a public service announcement

about energy
conservation.
It's the kind of
thing that
would be total

group like Or-

bital put it on their album, but here it's half in jest.
"Geogaddi" is music for lying around to.
But it's only half a joke — suns and solar power
keep cropping up on the album and the visual aes
thetic of the group's packaging draws heavily on the
way blurry sunlight looks on film. And, in some
loosely associative but intimately connected way,
that's what its music sounds like too.
The keyboard notes it produces owe a lot to the
soundtracks from old nature videos and they warble
like the sound in old filmstrips. Notes hardly ever
stay right on pitch; they dip fora second and it
sounds like time slows down, though the beats stay
tight as can be, tugging you back into the present.
Boards of Canada has been around for twenty
years, which is mind-boggling when you consider

that it released its first
album, "Music Has the
Right to Children," in
1998. Before that, its
members honed their
sound by making tapes
for their friends and
threw parties where
they showed their
homemade movies.
Now, famous and
adored by hip kids
everywhere, its sound is
incredibly mature, even
while it's still obsessed
with samples of small
children counting and
weird pastoral imagery.
If Autechre is all about
absolutely neutral, emo
tionless beauty, and
Aphex Twin is all ro
mantic excess and schizo-

phrenic moodswings, Boards of Canada loafs some
where in the psychedelic middle ground. Lovely, ide
alistic and strange, its hazy keyboards float some
where in the ether while its surprisingly hard beats
cut through the fog.
Everything about the band's music is simple, yet
it's constantly changing, as drums shift their timbre
or add the most delicate of high-hats, and thick
slabs of chords reveal voices moving in all sorts of
unexpected directions.
One of the most restrained and perfect things
I've ever heard is the kick drum at the beginning of
the first real song on the album, "Music is Math."
The pattern of three quarter-notes followed by a
rest and then four more is so stupidly simple, but
something about the way those four connect with
the next three to make a series of seven and the way
the track builds up from there, is not just brilliant
but profoundly right. You couldn't imagine it any
other way.


Which one of you punks shit his diaper?
