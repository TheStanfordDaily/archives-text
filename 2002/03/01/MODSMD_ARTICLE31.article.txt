# A 						night of Arabic music in Berkeley
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
For most Americans, the notion of Arabic
pop music is a bit of a contradiction. Since
the Sept. 11 attacks, many have given up on
Arab culture, denouncing it as backward,
anti-modern and, perhaps most tellingly,
anti-Western.
Those at the Berkeley Community The
atre on Friday night, however, saw a very
different side of the Arab world. Hakim,
Khaled and Simon Shaheen (who are
Egyptian, Alergian and Palenstinian, re
spectively) are all superstars in their native
countries and they brought a message of cel
ebration and joy to their mostly Arab and
Arab-American audience.
Hakim took the stage first, prefacing his
set, with a few brief but unexpected words
about the greater Arab community. Speak
ing in Egyptian Arabic, he promised that
he and his band would entertain the crowd
as best they could. However, he also allud
ed to the fact that by performing, he hoped

to reverse the negative image most Ameri
cans have of Arabs after the attacks. He
said, "I hope we can give them a different
idea of us after the trials and challenges we
have all faced."
And with that, the singer and his band
leapt into a frantic hour-and-a-half set with
the song "Esma Yalli [Listen to Me]."
In Egypt, Hakim is one of the premier
performers of a style of Arabic music called
jeel, which means "youth." It is a faster, catch
ier and more modern version of shaabi, a
style which roughly translated means "music
of the people." With lyrics sung in the collo
quial Egyptian dialect, it mixes Western in
struments — keyboards, bass guitars, accor
dions, saxophones and trombones — with
Eastern drums and other elements to create
a driving, infectious style that had the fans
dancing in the aisles of the theater.
Through the rest of his performance,
Hakim sang several of his hit songs, includ
ing "Hak'ale [It's Your Fault]" and "Wala
Wahed [Not Even One]," both of which had

the audience singing along.
A marvelous and energetic performer,
Hakim would have been difficult for any
one to follow. But Khaled, the Algerian-
French rai superstar is known for his live
act and the audience was expecting some
thing exceptional.
Though the audience mouthed the
words to "Aicha" and "Didi" in sync with
the singer, many of the songs were drawn
out, with more than a few cheesy guitar
solos thrown in.
Khaled is particularly recognized for fus
ing American funk and jazz with African and
Middle Eastern beats and rhythms. His per
formance, however, seemed like a watered
down version of all of these — if a restaurant
serves gumbo, falafel, enchiladas and ravioli,
you can expect all of them to taste pretty
stale, lacking any of their original zest.
Simon Shaheen, the Palestinian violinist
and oud player, joined Khaled's band fora
few songs, then took center stage to impro
vise on his oud, a stringed instrument, re

sembling a shortened guitar with a deeper,
more organic sound. Addressing the crowd
just once, Shaheen said that the night repre
sented a celebration of Arab music and cul-

when talking about Algeria, Egypt and Pales
tine," he said, "but tonight we will hear that
word often."
More than joy, however, there was a very
real sense of cultural pride in the theatre as a
community that has recently faced particu
larly difficult times had the opportunity to
enjoy themselves, if even for just a night.
