# Isaak 'Always' a reliable rocker
## 
### STEPHANIE PUN 
Don't hate Chris Isaak because he's
beautiful.
He's also got a gorgeous set of vocal
chords to go with those famously chis
eled facial features. Both are promi
nently featured on his new album, "Al
ways Got Tonight," which once again
showcases Isaak's finest qualities as an
artist — no, not his cheekbones, but his
unique blend of toe-tapping rock and
heart-wrenching lyrics.
Isaak's combination of soulful croon
ing and classic rock has classified him in
a category all his own. He is the only
man who can sing about heartache to an
upbeat melody in a major key, as evi
denced in his 1995 hit, "Somebody's
Cryin.'" The first single off his new
album, called "Let Me Down Easy," con
tinues in the same vein with a catchy gui
tar riff in the intro and a simple, upbeat
melody that provides an optimistic view
on a usually depressing subject matter.
Like his earlier albums, the recurrent
theme on "Always Got Tonight" is love
that never quite works out. There are
songs about unrequited love. There are
songs lamenting failed relationships.
There are songs about life after lost love.

Some of these songs, such as "Life Will Go
On," feature the same chilling vocals as
Isaak's first hit in 1990, "Wicked Game,"
leading one to believe that Isaak must
have had personal experience enabling
him to sing with such wrenching emotion.
Luckily, most of the songs, including
"Courthouse" and"I see You Every-

where," are fast-paced
and optimistic in tune if
not in lyrics. This way,
Isaak gives hope to
those of us who have
hopelessly pined away

for someone
or been kicked
around like

"Always
Got Tonight"
sounds fresh

and energetic, even for
Isaak, who is known for
his upbeat sound. In a
bold move away from
his previous style, Isaak
infuses his title track
with funk and attitude
that is rare in his

recordings. To create the updated sound
on his new album, Isaak collaborated
with producer John Shanks, who has also
produced for Stevie Nicks and Melissa
Etheridge. The result is an album of
songs that rock a little harder than his
previous recordings, but do not lose the
laid-back California attitude and simple

[Always Got Tonight '

melodic appeal for which Isaak's music is
known.
For the past year, Isaak has been occu
pied with splitting his time between his
musical career and his creatively titled
television show on Showtime, "The Chris

Isaak Show."
The two out
lets for his
music (his
band co-stars
on the show)
complement
each other,
and Isaak at-

tributes his growth as an artist to the syn
ergistic effects of the two. Isaak's career
seems to be on the rise, with his show
heading into its second season and a new
album with which to tour.
"Always Got Tonight" is an easily en
joyable album. All of the songs How har
moniously from one to the other, with
slower songs interspersed with faster
paced tunes. The album features enough
of Isaak's signature flavor and subject
matter to please purists, yet displays his
musical growth with its fresh take on his
classic pop / rock style.
And that chiseled face hasn't worn
away, either.
