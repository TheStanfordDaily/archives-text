# Dylan brings home the bacon

### ANTHONY HA 
This is the first in a series of articles called The Record Bin'exploring
classic albums from the past: pop music for people who like pop music.

There is an almost irresistible temptation when writing
about Hob Dylan's albums of the mid-'6os to slide into cliche
and pretension — "Dylan plugs in!" "Intelligent, poetic
rock STAR TS HERE!! IHE GREATEST WORK OF
ART OF THE 20TH CENTURY!!!" All of these may be
true, but after so much gushing it gets hard to see the forest
for the trees.
Like, say, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"
"Never Mind the Bollocks" or "Nevermind," it's becoming

ever more difficult to disen
tangle "Bringing It All Back
Home" the album from
"Bringing It All Back Home"
the event / legacy / whatever.
The reams of hyperbolic
prose written about the "sig
nificance" of Dylan going elec
tric, while often interesting,
also obscure the fact that these
11 songs kick serious ass.

The album starts off with the slightly country twang of a
guitar, a moment before the band joins in and Dylan
launches into the rapid fire, stream-of-consciousness lyrics
of "Subterranean Homesick Blues." After mocking the
sterility and absurdity of modern life ("I'lease her, please
him, buy gifts / Don't steal, don't lift / Twenty years of
schoolin'/ And they put you on the day shift "), he alter
nates between love songs ("Love Minus Zero / No Limit"),
satirical jabs at society ("Bob Dylan's 115 th Dream") and joy
fully absurd wordplay ("On The Road Again").
And yes, everything is sung in the same nasal voice that
so many of Dylan's detractors whine about. He may not be
particularly melodious, but Dylan spits out his lyrics with
undeniable passion and feeling. If you want songs that are
pretty and soothing, go listen to Enya.
Far from "selling out" as many of his folkie fans accused,

here Dylan broadens his scope both musically and lyrical
ly. The direct messages and simple melodies of the past are
replaced by sarcastic, surreal and occasionally obscure lyri
cal tapestries set to a driving beat and the screech of elec
tric guitars.
Dylan's social commitment remains evident; he just re
fuses to give easy answers or simplify issues. "Maggie's
Farm" may not lend itself as easily to sing-alongs as the op
timism of "The Times They Are A-Changin'," but it is no
less confrontational in its denunciation of labor exploita
tion. The chorus, "I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no
more," is Dylan's defiant snarl directed at both "the Man"
and anyone who tries to pigeonhole his music.
But what makes "Bringing It All Back Home" my fa-

vorite album? There is, of course, its al
most unparalleled combination of bril
liant, unforgettable lyrics with equally ad
venturous rock music. But why not one of
Dylan's follow-ups, "Highway 61 Revisit
ed" or "Blonde on Blonde?" They display
an equal lyrical virtuosity and, with their
bluesy rock, are musically superior to the
garage-band sound of "Bringing It All
Back Home." Have 1 allowed myself to be

swayed by the album's "importance," to choose it simply be
cause this is where "Dylan plugs in"? Well, maybe a little.
More importantly, only "Bringing It All Back Home"
closes with the mind-blowing acoustic pairing of "It's Al
right, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" and "It's All Over Now,
Baby Blue," both recorded in a single session with "Gates of
Eden," a session that is surely Dylan's finest hour.
The first song is an apocalyptic, nightmarish tour
through Dylan's vision of this modern world, set to a stark,
relentless melody. The song brims with ideas, and its surre
alism makes it no less haunting and relevant in its warning,
"It's easy to see without looking too far / that not much is re
ally sacred."
The equally dream-like "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"
sounds like the resigned sigh of an ending relationship. Yet
Dylan finishes singing, "Strike another match, go start anew
/ And it's all over now, Baby Blue," tempering the sadness

with a note of hope — as with much of the album, it may be
the end of the world as we know it, but he feels fine.
Anarchist Emma Goldman, condemning the preten
tiousness and myopia she saw in some of her fellow social re
formers, once wrote, "If I can't dance, I don't want to be part
of your revolution." On "Bringing It All Back Home,"
Dylan shows us that it's possible to do both.

tion. The chorus, "I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no
more," is Dylan's defiant snarl directed at both "the Man"
and anyone who tries to pigeonhole his music.
But what makes "Bringing It All Back Home" my fa-

vorite album? There is, of course, its al
most unparalleled combination of bril
liant, unforgettable lyrics with equally ad
venturous rock music. But why not one of
Dylan's follow-ups, "Highway 61 Revisit
ed" or "Blonde on Blonde?" They display
an equal lyrical virtuosity and, with their
bluesy rock, are musically superior to the
garage-band sound of "Bringing It All
Back Home." Have 1 allowed myself to be

swayed by the album's "importance," to choose it simply be
cause this is where "Dylan plugs in"? Well, maybe a little.
More importantly, only "Bringing It All Back Home"
closes with the mind-blowing acoustic pairing of "It's Al
right, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" and "It's All Over Now,
Baby Blue," both recorded in a single session with "Gates of
Eden," a session that is surely Dylan's finest hour.
The first song is an apocalyptic, nightmarish tour
through Dylan's vision of this modern world, set to a stark,
relentless melody. The song brims with ideas, and its surre
alism makes it no less haunting and relevant in its warning,
"It's easy to see without looking too far / that not much is re
ally sacred."
The equally dream-like "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"
sounds like the resigned sigh of an ending relationship. Yet
Dylan finishes singing, "Strike another match, go start anew
/ And it's all over now, Baby Blue," tempering the sadness

with a note of hope — as with much of the album, it may be
the end of the world as we know it, but he feels fine.
Anarchist Emma Goldman, condemning the preten
tiousness and myopia she saw in some of her fellow social re
formers, once wrote, "If I can't dance, I don't want to be part
of your revolution." On "Bringing It All Back Home,"
Dylan shows us that it's possible to do both.


"I like Fidel Castro and his beard."
This is the first in a series of articles called The Record Bin'exploring
classic albums from the past: pop music for people who like pop music.

There is an almost irresistible temptation when writing
about Hob Dylan's albums of the mid-'6os to slide into cliche
and pretension — "Dylan plugs in!" "Intelligent, poetic
rock STAR TS HERE!! IHE GREATEST WORK OF
ART OF THE 20TH CENTURY!!!" All of these may be
true, but after so much gushing it gets hard to see the forest
for the trees.
Like, say, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"
"Never Mind the Bollocks" or "Nevermind," it's becoming

ever more difficult to disen
tangle "Bringing It All Back
Home" the album from
"Bringing It All Back Home"
the event / legacy / whatever.
The reams of hyperbolic
prose written about the "sig
nificance" of Dylan going elec
tric, while often interesting,
also obscure the fact that these
11 songs kick serious ass.

The album starts off with the slightly country twang of a
guitar, a moment before the band joins in and Dylan
launches into the rapid fire, stream-of-consciousness lyrics
of "Subterranean Homesick Blues." After mocking the
sterility and absurdity of modern life ("I'lease her, please
him, buy gifts / Don't steal, don't lift / Twenty years of
schoolin'/ And they put you on the day shift "), he alter
nates between love songs ("Love Minus Zero / No Limit"),
satirical jabs at society ("Bob Dylan's 115 th Dream") and joy
fully absurd wordplay ("On The Road Again").
And yes, everything is sung in the same nasal voice that
so many of Dylan's detractors whine about. He may not be
particularly melodious, but Dylan spits out his lyrics with
undeniable passion and feeling. If you want songs that are
pretty and soothing, go listen to Enya.
Far from "selling out" as many of his folkie fans accused,

here Dylan broadens his scope both musically and lyrical
ly. The direct messages and simple melodies of the past are
replaced by sarcastic, surreal and occasionally obscure lyri
cal tapestries set to a driving beat and the screech of elec
tric guitars.
Dylan's social commitment remains evident; he just re
fuses to give easy answers or simplify issues. "Maggie's
Farm" may not lend itself as easily to sing-alongs as the op
timism of "The Times They Are A-Changin'," but it is no
less confrontational in its denunciation of labor exploita
tion. The chorus, "I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no
more," is Dylan's defiant snarl directed at both "the Man"
and anyone who tries to pigeonhole his music.
