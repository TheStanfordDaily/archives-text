# Natalie Imbruglia gets her angst on
## 
### SERENA LAUREN BLODGER 
After four years of battling ardent perfectionism, anx
ious record-label officials and beautiful island swans, Na
talie Imbruglia is set to release "White Lilies Island," her

follow-up to "Left of the Mid
dle." The album's single "Wrong
Impression" has already taken
hold of spots 6 and now 10 on the
Billboard's Top 40 list.
Listeners that fell captive to
Natalie's 1998 hit, "Torn," a de
lightful angst-ridden song filled
with rambunctious pessimisms,

might be disappointed by "White Lilies Island." New lis
teners, however, will find themselves immersed in a beau
tiful and simple musical journey exploring the deepest
pains and deepest joys of love.
Natalie's trademark lyric, "I'm cold and I am shamed /
Lying naked on the floor" has been replaced with the likes
of "And I'm small and I'm divine / And it's beautiful / And
it's coming / And it's already here / And it's absolutely per
fect" ("That Day") or "Did you ever feel sunlight on your
face / Did you ever taste clouds / Did you ever touch
space" ("Sunlight").
But "White Lilies Island" is by no means a happy-go-

lucky pop album. Natalie is still angst-ridden, just a little
more content and hopeful.
Two songs on the album, "Satellite" and "Every
thing Goes," are even reminiscent of the Australian

group Frente, known for its charm-

ing mid-'9os hit, "Labour
of Love." In those songs,
Natalie attests to her con
tentment in her new rela
tionship with Daniel
Johns, lead singer and
guitarist of the Australian
band "Silverchair."
"White Lilies Island"

certainly fills a void in today's music
arena. In areas where Michelle
Branch's spunky ballads are a little im
mature or Nelly Furtado is a tad too
innovative, Imbruglia pulls through
with soul-searching lyrics and a
thoughtful, mature sound.
At times, however, the album lacks
any evidence of musical risk. It is ap
parent that Natalie desired to live up
to "lorn" so badly that she forgot to
take risks with her songwriting. Con-

sequently, several of the album's songs lack much-needed
variation. At times, listeners might think: "Hey, that's
when you were supposed to surprise me by belting out
that high note and shaking me up emotionally, prompting

me to reevaluate my love life."
In a time when female artists
such as Nelly Furtado and Shakira
break the boundaries of the typical pop
song format through their unconven
tional instrumentation or constant
voice oscillation, Natalie sticks to a more
traditional singing style, without
putting her voice to full use or bringing
songs to their full potential.
On the other hand, due to the
album's charm and simplicity, "White
Lilies Island," is excellent soundtrack
music. There is not a song on the CD
that would not suit a "Dawson's Creek"
episode or teen summer flick perfectly.
Now, don't get me wrong. "White Lilies
Island" is a wonderful and addicting
follow-up to "Left of the Middle" that
fans of Natalie Imbruglia should not
miss â€”just as long as they know what
to expect.


So arigst-ridden she forgot to comb.
