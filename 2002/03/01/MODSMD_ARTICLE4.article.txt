The Stanford chapter of Alpha Kappa
Delta Phi will host its third annual Asian-
American women's conference this Satur
day. Ihe conference will consist of keynote
speakers, performances and workshops.
Kappa Delta Phi is the Asian-American
sorority on campus.
"[We've] been trying hard to work for the
community this year," said senior Kristina
Adachi, the sorority's service chair.
The conference will be an all-day event.
Its mission is to inspire and educate women
by bringing them together to learn from
each other's experiences, according to con
ference organizers.
More than 160 individuals are expected
to take part in this year's conference.
One of the objectives of the conference
is "having younger women come into con
tact with role models," Adachi said. "You
never read Asian-American books in high
school."

Other objectives include examining stu
dents' racial and ethnic identities.
The conference will include keynote
speakers Phoebe Eng and Vickie Nam.
Eng is an award-winning social activist, at
torney, national lecturer and acclaimed au
thor of "Warrior Lessons: An Asian Ameri
can Woman's Journey into Power."
Nam is the author and producer of "Yell-
Oh-Girls," an anthology of letters, essays and
poems from girls who tell stories of growing
up as Asian Americans.
Performances will include hip-hop dance
groups, selections from"The Vagina Mono
logues" and Wushu martial arts.
Participants will be able to attend two
workshops. The first covets issues like
body image and social activism and the
second consists of a panel devoted to
women's issues.
"We're emphasizing the diversity of
Asian-American women," Adachi said.
"We're making people realize their talents."
According to organizers, the conference
is not limited to Asian Americans and all are
encouraged to attend. While in the past the
event has targeted high school and college
students, this year organizers hope to attract
a broader range of audience members.
