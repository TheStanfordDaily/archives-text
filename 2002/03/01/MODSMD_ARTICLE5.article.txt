# New Tree takes the plunge

### DURANT GIPSON STAFF WRITER 
"I felt like a little boy on Christmas."
That's how freshman Andrew Parker
described his feelings early yesterday
when he learned he would be the new
Tree.
Parker will be the Free, the mascot for
the Stanford Band, for the 2002-2003
school year.
This year's annual selection culminat
ed early yesterday morning before sun
rise when the Stanford Band serenaded
Parker and his fellow Roble residents for
about half an hour.
"It's not what inspired me. I want to
inspire other people," Parker said. "I
just want to be someone people can look
up to."
Fourteen students applied to be the
Tree, and 12 participated in Tree Week,
a period where applicants typically per
form outrageous stunts. Of these, six
were interviewed, and Parker was finally
chosen Wednesday night.
The selection process was conducted
by a committee including Band manage
ment and former Trees.
"I anticipate great things from this
young man, some great things and some
dangerous things," said commitee mem
ber Evan Meagher, who was the Tree
three years ago.
Meagher and Parker attended the
same high school in Massachusetts.
"I think it's something in the water
there," said Meagher.
Sophomore Chuck Armstrong, the
Tree for the 2001-2002 school year, said
he also anticipates a strong "treedom" for

Parker. "He'll bring the healing light of
pain, the iron grip of comfort," said Arm
strong. "People will take comfort in his
iron will yet fear his grasp."
This is in line with Parker's plans. He
said he wants his personality as Tree to
be multi-faceted.
"I'm going to be tough, but loose,"
Parker said. "Because you're boring if
you're just one thing . . . men have two if
not 22 different faces."
To become the Tree, Parker per
formed some extreme stunts last week.
He was married to the Tree of 2000-
2001, senior Alex Newell, for 24 hours
before having the marriage annulled.
He was shot with a .45 caliber bullet,
according to Meagher. But Parker was
wearing a bullet-proof vest at the time.

Parker also rappelled down Hoover
Tower while on fire. According to
Meagher, Parker was wearing a fire
proof suit and was coated in a low-tem
perature burning isomer of ethanol.
Parker's favorite stunt was a staged
drowning in Memorial Fountain. Arm
strong said it seemed like his head was
under water for three minutes.
"We wanted the extreme, the super
natural," said Armstrong. "That's why
the theme of cheating death worked.
"It was clear from the tryouts that he
possessed the reckless regard for person
al safety and for the opinion of others"
needed to be Tree, Meagher said.
Parker said that his stunts were a

metaphor for the life of a Christian
man. He was married. After the
fake drowning, he was reborn.
And when he was shot, he died.
Rappelling down Hoover

Tower was a stunt that paid
homage to former trees.
The stunt had been done be
fore, but Parker added his own sig
nature. "We were really impressed
with the performance, his being on
fire," said Meagher.
Parker enjoyed auditioning to
be the Tree.
"Tree Week was just a good

time," Parker said. "It wasn't an
issue whether I got it or not."
When asked what will be his
legacy, Parker said, "We're all
just one large unit There is just
one big ocean, and you can look
at the waves. I may crash into the
sand and leave a mark, but those
who came before me did that and
those who come after will too."
