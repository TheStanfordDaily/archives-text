Students and administrators mingled
with prominent venture capitalists last
night at a dinner hosted by the Asia
Technology Initiative.
The initiative is a University program
that will send 15 undergraduate and
graduate students to participate in high
tech internships in Shanghai, Tokyo and
Bangalore, India for three months this
summer.

At the dinner, Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John Bravman
said to the 60 people in attendance that
the program, like venture capital itself, is
an investment.
"When [the initiative] approached
me," Bravman said, "I decided again to
invest in people."
Bravman traveled to China last year to
participate in an entrepreneurship con
ference at the Shanghai site.
"1 was amazed at the vitality, the ener
gy, the drive of the people . .. it was clear

to me that this was a place Stanford need
ed to be," Bravman said.
Keynote speaker Matthew Rothman,
chief executive officer of the $1 billion
Softbank / IFC Emerging Market Fund,
discussed the enormous potential and
future challenges of foreign investment.
Rothman said he expects huge growth in
Asian enterprise over the next four years.
He said his venture efforts look to
"unlock value" by taking emerging-mar
ket companies to a global level.
"There has to be more encourage
ment of these kinds of programs, because
that's where innovation really blossoms,"
Rothman said.
Jason Cheng, one of the initiative's
three executive directors, said that in ad
dition to encouraging entrepreneurship,
the program aims to "promote cross-cul
tural sharing." To this end, the student
interns will take a spring seminar featur
ing talks from industry leaders and offer
presentations on their experiences when
they return to Stanford fall quarter.
While in Asia, Stanford students will
form small teams and match up with in
formation technology and biotechnology
start-ups with in the Bay Area.
Junior Barnali Dasverma, director at
the Bangalore site, said that the mentor
ship aspect was the most meaningful part
of her experience.
Tokyo director Angela Tseng, a mas
ter's student in management science and
engineering, agreed. She noted that
weekly mentorship meetings gave her

abundant opportunities to get to
know the co-founders of the
Tokyo company for whom she in
terned.
Weekly activities, collaboration
with foreign university students,
close interaction with start-ups and
entrepreneurial conferences all
made ATI more than a typical in
ternship, she said.
"We want to engage Stanford
students in meaningful work,"
Tseng said.
Program organizers said that
site choice is key to this aspect of
the initiative's mission. Shanghai,
Tokyo and Bangalore are all in
their second year as host cities. Stu
dents have also traveled to Hong
Kong and Beijing in the four years

the program has existed.
"Sites are chosen where we can
really learn the most," executive
director Ping Wang said. "For ex
ample, China is possibly the largest
emerging market."
"We want to bring back from
Asia the fruits of global innova
tion," Sunaina Sinha, also an ex
ecutive director of the initiative,
said.
The staff relies on numerous
business advisors, especially in the
venture capital field, to recom
mend companies with the Silicon
Valley pioneering spirit."
Edwin Yeh, vice president of
technology at Dragon Venture in
Palo Alto, said he was glad to assist
with cross-Pacific networking.
"I want to volunteer and help
out because I was an entrepreneur
myself," Yeh said.
Richard Dasher and Tina Seel
ig, along with Bravman, provide

assistance from the Stanford com
munity to the initiative.
This year, more than 200 appli
cants competed for 15 spots. Of
these, eight will travel to Shang
hai, three to Tokyo and four to
Bangalore.
Junior Michael Sego will intern
in Bangalore this summer.
"What I am looking forward to
most is really seeing a new per
spective on the future of the high
tech industry," Sego said. "All too
often computer science majors as
sume they will just get a job in Sili
con Valley."
Stanley Lin, a graduate student
in management science and engi
neering, said he envisions a
twofold benefit in his upcoming
Tokyo internship.
"1 am interested in working with
an overseas company, and I want to
immerse myself in the culture â€”
business and otherwise," Lin said.
