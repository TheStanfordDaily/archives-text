# Students join protests to support immigrant airport workers

### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a series of events designed to show
support for immigrant airport workers,
Stanford students joined with hundreds of
protesters Feb. 19 to protest new federal
airport policies.
Protests were simultaneously held at
three local area airports — San Francisco
International, Oakland International
and San Jose International. The events

were part of a Bay Area campaign against
a law that requires all airport security
screeners to he U.S. citizens. According to
industry estimates, more than 70 percent
of SFO's 550 workers are non-citizens.
The Oakland and San Jose airports
have significant numbers as well, with 75
and 35 percent of their screeners without
citizenship, respectively.
The following student organizations
were represented at the rally: the Pilipino
American Student Union, the Stanford

Labor Action Coalition, the Stanford
Committee for Peace and Justice, Students
for Environmental and Social Justice, the
Stanford Asian American Activists Coali
tion and MECHa.
Protesters characterized the law as an
attempt at legalized racism.
"It's the politics of 'us-and-them,'" said
Amor Santiago, president of Asian Ameri
cans for Community Involvement in San
Jose. "When are we going to get it right?"
Federal officials in the Transportation

Security Administration said the law,
named the "USA Patriot Act," will allow
more thorough background checks on
screeners and increase customer confi
dence in airport security. In addition, the
Aviation and Transportation Security Act,
signed into law in November, makes air
port screeners federal employees, but de
nies them most federal-employee rights
and benefits.
If the law is not changed, the non-citi
zen screeners will be replaced by U.S. citi-

Zen workers on Nov. 19.
Despite the claims of better security
through these laws, most protesters saw
the government as singling out immi
grants. They claimed the government is
making them scapegoats for the events of
Sept. 11.
"Everyone knows the 'War on Terror
ism' has become a war on immigrants,"
Gerardo Sandoval, a SFO supervisor, said.
The Stanford Labor Action
Coalition joined with labor
groups across the Bay Area to
participate in the protests. Stu
dents echoed the view that immi

grants were being unfairly dis
criminated against.
"It's a racist excuse, and
there's no justification for it," said
junior Kuusela Hilo, chair of the
Pilipino American Student
Union. "The government is
blaming immigrants."
Protesters commended the
actions of Sen. Dianne Fein-

Stein, D-Calif., who is working to
get fast-track legislation passed
that enables airport screeners to
be made U.S. citizens more
quickly.
However, some Filipino«screen
ers are reluctant to give up their
citizenship, because doing so will
forfeit any claims to property they
own in the Philippines.
