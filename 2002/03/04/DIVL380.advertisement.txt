SPEECH CONTEST: $500 Prizes!
The Oral Communication Program at the Center for Teaching &
Learning is proud to announce its second annual Speech Contest:
Riskjful Thinking
al M>wed
C,a iv I K ~i
"The core task of college is intellectual complexification. That means... we
are not about finding or transmitting solutions; we are not about recipes; we are
not about making intellectual life easy. We are about making intellectual life
difficult.. .because confrontation with complexity is what expands your mind...
A metaphor for this confrontation with intellectual complexity, [is what] I call
Riskful Thinking.'"
-Professor Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Comparative Literature
Now is your chance to pay tribute to teaching that challenged you: your thinking,
your intellectual limits, your sense of what was possible. Tell us about a teacher who
emphasized complex questions rather than easy answers. Tell us about the hardest
class you ever loved. Tell us about someone who stimulated you to pursue Riskful
Thinking.
We want to hear these stories in the form of a manuscript speech that takes no
longer than five minutes to deliver. We encourage you to approach the topic in the
spirit of Riskful Thinking: be daring in your approach, your writing, and your subject
matter. Multimedia* entries are encouraged and will be considered in a separate
prize category. Speeches can be about a class, a particular professor, a TA, or perhaps
an unexpected teacher in your university career. Surprise us with powerful speeches
that illustrate the impact of Riskful Thinking on your learning experience.
*We define multimedia broadly to include any supplemental use of sound or image.
Application Process:
Submit a written copy of your manuscript speech to the Center for Teaching &
Learning, 4'" Floor, Sweet Hall, Attn: John Bilderbeck. Alternatively, you can send your
speech via Microsoft Word e-mail attachment to johnb@vpue.stanford.edu. If you are
submitting a multimedia entry, you should submit a brief description of what you
intend to do and include a sample of your media. A panel will select a group of
undergraduate and graduate finalists based upon the written submissions. Finalists
will then be invited to present their speech orally to the judging committee. One
undergraduate winner, one graduate winner, and one multi-media winner will be
selected from the finalists and will each receive a $500.00 prize.
Entries must be received by Friday, April 12.
For more information, contact John Bilderbeck (johnb@vpue.stanford.edu, (650) 736-2132).
