1983
On March 4,1983, Hie Daily printed an ar
ticle alxuit Queen Elizabeth visiting Stanford.
"By all accounts, the royal visit was a
success.
"England's Queen Elizabeth 11, Prince
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and their en
tourage safely snuck in the back of campus
yesterday and were received at Hoover
House, the residence of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and his wife Jeanne,
for the carefully planned luncheon.
" The 20-car cavalcade's route, previously
unannounced, led from Highway 280 along
Page Mill Road toJuniperoSerra Boulevard
and onto campus via Santa Maria Street.
"The couple emerged from their limou
sine — marked by both American and royal
Hags — a few minutes before the scheduled
12:40 p.m. luncheon. The queen's bright
turquoise dress and matching hat were ap
propriate for the first day the royal party
lias spent in California.
Secret Service agents and local police offi
cers lined the streets around the house before
the luncheon, and several California I ligh
way Patrol cars invaded campus when the en
tourage arrived, but guests at Hoover House
said the atmosphere inside was fairly relaxed.
"Many commented on the queen's and
prince's evident curiosity about the University.
Bottom Line: Queen Elizabeth should come back
soon or, before she knows it, the Band won't
even be allowed to play for her visit.
