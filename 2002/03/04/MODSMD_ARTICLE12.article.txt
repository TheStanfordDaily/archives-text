"Every school child knows that
Tyrannosaurus rex was the biggest,
fiercest predator in the Age of Rep
tiles. No plant-eating Triceratop or
duckbill dinosaur was safe when a
hungry T. rex came around with sharp
teeth ready to tear flesh.
"But scientists have now found that
this fearsome animal was not superior
in all respects. It was biomechanically
disadvantaged. Contrary to what had
been thought, T. rex was slow of foot.
"It lacked enough muscle in its legs
to produce the forces required for an
animal of its huge size to break into a
sprint, let alone achieve the 45 mile
per-hour speeds some paleontologists
once assumed. The surprising discov
ery, being reported in today's issue of
the journal Nature, was made by Dr.
John R. Hutchinson of Stanford and
Dr. Mariano Garcia of Cornell. The
two men, specialists in biomechanics,
conducted their research while at the
University of California."
