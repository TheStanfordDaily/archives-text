Scientists have long seen addiction in the terms
of a "learning process." The body of a drug user,
for example, learns to expect the drug, thus be
coming increasingly dependent on it.
Recent studies have examined the affinity be
tween cocaine and glutamate, one of several chem
ical neurotransmitters that govern communica
tions between nerve cells. Researchers have found
that glutamate activates brain cells dedicated to
dopamine, which induces feelings of reward and

pleasure. A study published last Sep
tember showed that mice lacking

a specific glutamate receptor

did not become addicted to

cocaine.
However, developing
a drug to block glutamate
receptors is difficult be
cause it could interfere
with thousands of other
processes. Still, glutamate

studies strengthen the be

havioral approach to addiction

by encouraging drug users to "un
learn" their dependency.

Testing microbes traditionally requires using
nasal swabs and blood samples, culturing and
waiting two days. However, Christopher Woolver
ton and five colleagues at Kent State University
have devised a pathogen detector that gives results
in less than five minutes.
The commercial version basically divides the
sample into several subsamples. Each subsample
is tested against an antibody embedded in liquid
crystals. If the antibody binds the pathogen, the
liquid crystal changes, causing polarized light to
shine through. This way, the output is immedi
ately revealed.
The product is being commercialized by Micro-
Diagnosis in Bellevue, Washington. Perhaps it's
time for Cowell to go shopping.
Chemists and geologists from Binghamton
University and Johns Hopkins University have

found proof that the chemistry of oceans is con
stantly changing. The new theory says that as tec
tonic plates move, the released magma absorbs
magnesium and emits calcium.
For evidence, the researchers collected ancient
sea crystals from around the world that contained
densely packed drops of water. By examining the
fluid under an electron microscope, they found
that the chemical composition of the crystals was
the same within each respective time period.
Authors of the study surmise that these tiny
changes may have affected the evolution of cer
tain marine life species, such as algae. The study
adds to the growing picture of oceans as dynamic
components in determining the planet's weather
and biodiversity.
The cosmological constant, first predicted by
Einstein, is a comprehensive measure of space

time. Although modern cosmolo-

CT
gists have confirmed the mea-

O
sure is constant, they are

still surprised to find

fluctuations.
Researcher Dou
glas Finkbeiner and his
â– team at Princeton Uni
versity think the cause
may be galactic dust.
When dust grains in

space are hit by ions, they

start to rotate and release

their energy, interfering with

the dynamics of space time. This en
ergy adds to the background radiation, which is es
sentially energy left over from the Big Bang.
Future observers may be able to better take into
account this type of emission, thus obtaining more
accurate cosmological measures.
Shou-Cheng Zhan and colleagues at Stanford
have developed a four-dimensional version of a
quantum system that could exist on the surface of
a sphere in five dimensions. Their theorem inte
grates quantum theory of gravity, superstrings,
quantum loops and several other modern ideas on
the universe.
However, the model cannot be visualized. It
can only be conceptualized on a mathematical
basis. Although it seems consistent, physicists
elsewhere have been skeptical, some claiming
that it describes particle interaction inadequately.
Overall, accepting it as valid requires a giant leap
of faith, say critics.
