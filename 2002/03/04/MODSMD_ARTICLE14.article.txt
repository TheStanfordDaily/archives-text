## The
						Stanford Daily Res Ed should facilitate election-week dialogue 
### 
Published Since 1891

Residential Education recently an
nounced that it would enforce rules
prohibiting candidates for ASSU of
fices from campaigning door-to-door
or flyering in dormitory bathrooms this year.
While the reasoning behind this decision has
some merit, Res Ed should recognize that can
didates need viable and legitimate ways to con
vey their platforms to voters to keep this year's
election campaigns from degenerating into
popularity contests.
According to Res Ed, bathroom flyering and
door-to-door campaigning are forms of dorm
solicitation. Technically, this is true. But the
point of Res Ed's policy against solicitation
should be to protect students from advertisers,
marketers and salesmen bent on exploiting the
student market. It is obviously not in students'
interest to have insurance salesmen knocking
on their doors three times per week.

In contrast, having access to information
about the people who will represent their inter
ests as ASSU officers clearly and directly benefits
students â€” such information is what allows stu
dents to vote for the candidates who will do the
best job of advocating their views and working
to improve their quality of life.
In restricting students' access to information
about candidates, Res Ed would be not be pro
tecting their interests but rather doing them a
disservice.
Res Ed claims that flyering in bathrooms gets
out of control during election week, during
which some stalls are plastered from top to bot
tom with sheets carrying candidates' slogans
and articulating their views and intentions. This
presumably forces bathroom users to read the
flyers, impinging upon their right to a propa
ganda-free bathroom experience.
This argument is unconvincing on two levels.

First, many students would likely be happy to
have something to occupy their attention while
doing their business. More significantly, candi
dates for student office feel that the bathroom is
the only place where people can actually take
the time to read detailed flyers and weigh the
views and arguments contained therein.
Candidates are allowed to post one flyer per
hall on billboards specifically designated for
public announcements. However, the limited
space available on such billboards combined
with students' disinclination to stand in the hall
long enough to pore over all the candidates' fly
ers makes this an insufficient solution.
Aside from bathroom flyering, many in the
ASSU feel that their best chance to communi
cate with voters on a substantive level comes
from their door-to-door campaigns, during
which they meet their potential constituents and
find out what issues are most important to them.

For many students, meeting the candidates
and having an opportunity to ask them ques
tions about their stances in an informal, one
on-one setting makes all the difference in
transforming the election from an arbitrary
and impersonal process to a meaningful and
worthwhile experience.
The personal connection that students
form with the candidates, albeit brief, can give
them a sense of personal connection to the
election process and the ASSU in general.
Trying to prevent such interaction would
eliminate the one component of election week
that many students feel is truly worthwhile.
Moreover, it would seem difficult to prevent stu
dents from dropping by a dorm to talk to
friends or meet new people just because they
happen to be candidates for the upcoming elec-
