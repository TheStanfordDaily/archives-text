# DANCING IN CIRCLES
## Have a ball tearing down outdated gender barriers 
### 
Ah, the Viennese Ball. Ladies in
flowing ball gowns and gentle
men in slick tuxedos', waltzing the
night away. Bowing softly to your
partner at the end of each dance. Bumping
into old friends, remarking on their gor
geous dresses while eating fancy food with
baby forks. Elegant ladies escorted to the
dance floor on the arms of dashing gentle
men. And for the most part, the gentlemen
leading those ladies in graceful waltzes and
swing steps. It's so much fun, fora night, to
feel elegant and beautiful and watch a long
skirt swishing as you twirl.
But in a way it didn't look like the Stan-

ford I know —or did it? At
Stanford, we wear jeans to
class, to parties, hell
,maybe even to sleep. At
Stanford, men and
women don't have such
defined roles. We study
together, run dorm gov
ernments together, al
ways as equals — at least in

theory. But here at the ball the difference
was pronounced, and we seemed to be rev
eling in it.
Hmm, how about a different scene?
rhe next night, clubbing in San Francisco,
all decked out, shaking your booty to the
techno beat. Chilling with your friends, re
laxing from a hard week, trying out some
new moves. Guys in jeans and t-shirts,
women wearing significantly less, and
tighter-fitting, clothing. Cleavage all
around. Guys coming up behind you,
putting arms around your waist, moving
their hands over your body.
Is that really so different from what was
going on at the Viennese ball? Guys and
girls dressing ourselves up, putting on an
attitude so that we can play the roles of well
— guys and girls? In both cases we are
putt ing on a persona, acting out our sex.
The thing about gender is that it mani
fests itself in so many negative ways. As the
UN reported in 1980, women perform the
majority of the world's work hours, receive
one-tenth of its income and own less than
one-hundredth of the world's property. In
2002, women still earn an average of 73
cents on a man's dollar for the same
amount of work. Men tend to miss out on
being primary caregivers for children.
Here at Stanford, men feel outnumbered
in sociology, and women in engineering.
Men feel pressure to get big, women to get
small. Men don't (usually) get to wear ball
gowns, and women don't (usually) get to
lead. Gender constrains us in so many ways
that we don't even notice.
I low come "feminine" means I can't ex
press my opinions with confidence? How
come "masculine" means I must present
my ideas as God-given truth, even if I'm
not sure? What is it about our different
genitalia that necessitates an entirely dif

ferent way of interacting with the world?
Yes, there are counter-examples. And
yes, the world is changing. But not
fast enough.
Since childhood we spend hours upon
hours learning to walk, talk, dance and do
our hair in ways that distinguish us as male
or female. And if we refuse? VVe face the
possibility of social isolation.
But gender must be good for some
thing, or else why would we put so much
effort into maintaining it? I have to admit,
there is something comforting about
knowing that grandma cooks and grandpa
takes out the trash. And gender differences
are damn good flirting material.
But the idea that gender differences as
they stand now are natural or inevitable is
absurd. Time magazine summed it up
well in an article on the tendency for
males to have more sexual partners: The
question is whether females are less in
clined to seek a diversity of partners,
should the opportunity arise. Basing
your answer on the behavior of women
in recent times is a little like studying gi
raffes in a zoo and concluding they can't
run. Deciding that women just don't
like, or aren't qualified, to lead a dance is
like those giraffes in the zoo. So is decid
ing that women are just better at hu
manities and men at engineering. Or
that women are more inclined to be care
takers and men to be breadwinners. The
data just can't be trusted. We're too
boxed-in by our notions of how each
gender should act.
And even if gender were natural —
who cares? Do you want to live your life in
a box? God didn't give Adam and Eve a
car, but does that mean you don't want
one? Someone once complained to me
that feminists wanted to eliminate gender,
making everyone act the same. This same
ness, they said, would be boring and
would stifle diversity.
But it's quite the opposite. Eliminating
the compulsion for females to act like
women and males to act like men would
open up room for all sorts of experimen
tation. Instead of following a prescription,
it would invite us to pick and choose what
we like about masculinity and femininity,
creating new worlds of identity.
I love that girly-sketchy-club sexy fem
inine feeling, but it's hard to believe that's
natural. If I can en joy the curvy-smooth
hip-shaking persona, why can't men
share the feeling? Why has it been that in
order to create gender equality, I have to
wear pants instead of my male contempo
raries donning dresses?
Tearing down gender barriers is about
choices. My choice and yours to dare to live
however we want.
