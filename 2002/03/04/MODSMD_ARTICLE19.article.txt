Hoover exhibit disrespectful to those
involved in civil rights movement
I had the pleasure of visiting the Stan
ford campus this week. During our walk we
stopped in to see Hoover lower, where
there is a small exhibit that dismayed me.
In the central entrance hall, there is an ex
hibit case showing several "mass move
ments." The first one was the Nazis, fol
lowed by the civil rights movement and a
very small mention of Mohandas Gandhi,
and then tlu- third was the Islamic Jihad. I
thought putting the Nazi movement and
the c iv il rights movement in the same case,
implying that there is some connection, to
be very disturbing. I can hardly imagine
any way that could be more disrespectful of
the the many people who were involved in
the civil rights movement.

Ultimate-tournament director thanks Band
I just wanted to take a minute and thank
the Stanford Band for coming out this
weekend and supporting the Stanford
Men's and Women's Ultimate Frisbee
teams. I know I speak for both teams when
I say that their presence was extra motiva
tion and a welcomed boost. For those who
weren't there, the men's team went on to
win the tournament for the first time in sev
eral years. I laving the Band there was def
initely one of the steps along the way. I
don't think I have ever felt more a part of
the Stanford community than I did this
weekend. Thank you, Band and everyone
else who came out.
