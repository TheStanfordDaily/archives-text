GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE,
Cuba (AP) — Scores of captives from the
Afghan war refused meals Sunday in a protest
that has lasted five days, but the U.S. military
said only 13 of them had kept to the hunger
strike since its start.
The military revealed the new tally after offi
cials finished a cell-by-cell count of those who
had refused food since the start of the protest
on Wednesday.
The announcement coincided with a visit by
FBI Director Robert Mueller, who arrived yes
terday afternoon and was whisked away fora
tour of the detention compound known as
Camp X-ray.
"We have 13 individuals who have not eaten
at all since this hunger strike started," said Ma
rine Capt. Joe Kloppel, a spokesman for the de
tention mission at this U.S. outpost in south
eastern Cuba. "Others have had at least one
meal since this whole thing started."
Military spokesmen had previously said
at least half of those participating appeared
to have been refusing food since Wednes
day.
So far, at least nine detainees have been

given liquids with an intravenous drip, one
against his wishes.
A large group among the 300 de
tainees stopped eating Wednesday, some
telling their captors "they were upset that
a guard stripped a detainee of his turban
during prayers on Tuesday.
Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Lehnert later
told detainees lie would allow them to wear tur
bans but that guards had the right to inspect
them at any time. In the past, turbans had been
banned because ofTears a prisoner could hide a
dangerous object in it.
Lehnert, commander of the detention mission,
siiicl on Saturday that while the turban issue was one
cause, the detainees' underlying concern is uncer
tainty over their indefinite detention.
U.S. officials are determining whether and
how to prosecute the men. They say those not
tried by a military tribunal could be prosecut
ed in U.S. courts, returned to their home
countries for prosecution, released outright
or held indefinitely.
"It's premature for me to discuss the timing
of any charges," Mueller said. "1 know the De
partment of Defense is working on the proce

(lures. My expectation is that we will see those
procedures in the very near future."
The prisoners — who the U.S. military
says belong to the al-Qaida terrorist network
and Afghanistan's fallen Taliban regime —
are not being allowed lawyers during their
interrogations.
The number of prisoners refusing to eat
has varied by day and meal, with 85 de
tainees declining breakfast on Saturday,
then 73 refusing lunch and 90 skipping din
ner that day, officials said. The number has
declined from a high of 194 who refused
lunch on Thursday.
Most of those who are dehydrated agreed to
treatment. But one of the nine who resisted is
still "being given IV without consent," Navy
Captain A1 Shimkus said.
The hunger strike is the first such protest
since the initial group of detainees was flown to
Guantanamo on Jan. 11.
Tensions had been building at the camp
even before the protest. In recent days, prison
ers have been ignoring a taped call to prayer
and instead have picked individual detainees to
announce and lead prayers.
