# U.S. bombers make progress in Afghanistan

SURMAD, Afghanistan (A!') â€”
U.S. bombers pounded al-Qaida and
Taliban positions in the eastern
mountains of Afghanistan yesterday
after a 1,500-strong coalition ground
attack the day before failed to dislodge
the well-armed fighters.
Afghan troops warned the op
eration to dislodge the regrouping
Taliban and al-Qaida forces from
their hide-outs in the mountain
caves here in Paktia province was
far from over.
"You can't do everything in one
operation," said Raza Khan, an
Afghan fighter recovering from
Saturday's battle at the hospital in
the provincial capital, Garde/.
"This is Afghanistan. This is a
guerrilla war."
The assault, which began with
bombing raids late Friday, was be
lieved to be the largest joint U.S.-
Afghan military operation of the 5-
month-old terrorism war. Pro-
U.S. Afghan troops approached

the hide-outs from three direc
tions to isolate the fighters and
prevent them from escaping.
Yesterday's operations were
mostly limited to airstrikes as B
-52s and other warplanes repeated
ly pounded targets in the Shah-e-
Kot Mountains 20 miles east of
Surmad and the Kharwar range to
the west in Logar province.
"You can see it is a big operation,"
said one Afghan commander, Abdul
Matin Hassan Kheil, who led 50 fight
el's at a front-line position. He said
coalition forces were dug in about one
mile from al-Qaida bases in the Shah
e-Kot Mountains.
Kheil estimated it would take a
month to push the fighters from
their mountain strongholds.
Saturday's ground attack, car
ried out in snow-covered moun
tains ranging from 8,300 to 11,600
feet above sea level, appeared to
have made little headway in dis
lodging Taliban and al-Qaida

fighters who are regrouping in the
hills of eastern Afghanistan.
"Firefights have been intense at
times in heavy combat action,"
Maj. A.C. Roper, spokesman of the
101st Army Division in southern
Kandahar, told reporters Sunday.
A U.S.-led force of 1,500
Afghan allies, U.S. Special Forces
and troops from the Army's 101st
Airborne assault troops had assem
bled for the battle, a U.S. defense
official said.
After the ground attack stalled,
U.S. planes late Saturday dropped
newly developed bombs designed
to send suffocating blasts through
cave complexes, military officials
said. The "thermobaric" bombs
were tested in December and offi
cials said in January that they
would be rushed to the region for
the war.
Afghan fighters recovering
Sunday at Gardez hospital de
scribed the operation as two

pronged, with one group of
Afghan troops and U.S. Special
Forces launching a frontal attack
on the mountains and a second at
tempting to ambush from the rear.
The first stage of the offensive
was designed to cut the road from
Shah-e-Kot to trap al-Qaida and
Taliban forces in the mountains,
said Safi Ullah of Gardez. He said
the plan also involved setting up
checkpoints in the area to prevent
them from escaping.
Pakistan closed its border to
block fleeing al-Qaida or Taliban
members and deployed extra
army units and members of the
Khasadar tribal militia to catch any
who try to cross the frontier.
Afghan officials say as many as
5,000 al-Qaida and Taliban fight
ers are regrouping in eastern
Afghanistan and just over the bor
der in Pakistan, urging the faithful
to wage holy war against U.S.
forces.
