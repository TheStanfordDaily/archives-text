# Priests' misconduct has economic costs
## 
### 
(AP) — Sexual misconduct by
Roman Catholic priests has cost
the church in lost faith and bro
ken lives. Yet the damage from
the scandals has been financial
as well as spiritual.
Dioceses have sold land and
buildings to pay off multimil
lion-dollar settlements. Some
have borrowed heavily from
other dioceses or their own
parishes. Insurers have limited
coverage, while bishops have
quietly paid thousands of dollars
in therapy costs for abusive
priests and their victims.
The nationwide financial toll
of the wrongdoing is not known,
since most settlements are confi
dential. Estimates of payouts to
victims range from $300 million
up to $1 billion.
Whatever the number, the
experiences of individual dioce
ses indicate the impact has been
significant — and could be simi
lar in the Archdiocese of Boston,
now struggling through the lat
est scandal.
The Diocese of Santa Rosa,
Calif., had to sell property and
take loans or donations of at
least $7 million from about half
the nation's 192 dioceses to help
erase a $16 million debt related
to sexual misconduct.
The Diocese of Dallas had to
mortgage and sell property to
pay $11 million that its insur
ance didn't cover in the more
than $30 million settlement
against pedophile and former
priest Rudy Kos.
The Archdiocese of Santa
Fe, N.M., was brought to the
brink of bankruptcy, and had
to borrow from parish savings
accounts to pay more than $50
million to settle 40 abuse cases
in the 19905.
The diocese settled a total of
165 such cases, but won't say

how much it paid to resolve
them.
"If there's any secret more
well-kept than the priest abusers
it is the money that's paid out,"
said A. VV. Richard Sipe, a psy
chotherapist and former priest
who works with plaintiffs in sex
abuse cases. "They're terribly
frightened that the fundi aising
will drop."
The expenses don't end with
the payouts.
Bishops customarily pay
therapy costs for priests suspect
ed of sexual misconduct. Coun
seling at institutes that treat cler
gy costs up to $350 a day, with
an average stay lasting between
four and seven months, accord
ing to the Rev. Stephen Rosett i,
a psychologist and consultant to
the United States Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
Several dioceses, including
Santa Rosa and the Archdiocese
of New Orleans, have also paid
counseling costs for abuse vic
tims. Insurers are seeking to
limit their liability in sexual mis
conduct cases.
In cases of large settlements,
the insurer and the diocese usu
ally end up in court over how
much the policy covers. The dio
ceses' defense costs — which can
be in the millions of dollars —
often aren't fully covered by in
surance.
The financial strain comes at
a difficult time for the church.
The slowing economy and
population shifts have forced
many dioceses to close parishes
and schools.
Attorney Sylvia Demarest,
who represented plaintiffs in the
Dallas case, said victims began
seeking large settlements in the
1980s when criminal cases for
the first time revealed abuse was
a problem nationwide.
