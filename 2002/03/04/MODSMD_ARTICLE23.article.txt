Monday: No. 2 Stanford vs.
Arizona State, 7:30 p.m., Eu
gene, Ore., Championship
game of the Pac-10 Conference
Tournament

The No. 1 Cardinal proved its
strength this weekend, winning
convincingly against both UCLA
and Oregon State without leading
scorer Lindsey Yamasaki.
Yamasaki, a senior guard, was
sidelined from the tournament
after undergoing a laparoscopic ap
pendectomy on Tuesday.
Yamasaki's absence was obvious
in the first few moments of both
games as Stanford tried to find an
offensive rhythm without her. After

a rocky start, the team quickly got in
t he groove of things, thanks in large
measure to the continued stellar
contributions of the Pac-10 Player
of the Year, Nicole Powell.
The sophomore forward scored
a career-high 37 points on 13-of
-22 shooting in the Cardinal's 71 -55
win over Oregon State on Sunday.
Twenty-seven of those points came
in the first half as Powell single
handedly outscored the entire
Beaver squad, which finished with
19 at the break.
" The first half was Nicole," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "She
really kept us afloat."
Powell's 14 boards marked her
ninth double-double of the season.
An aggressive and hungry
Oregon State gave Stanford more
than a bit of trouble in the first
half, as the Beavers kept the score
close. They closed the deficit to
one point with just under nine
minutes remaining in the half.
Powell answered with a huge
three-pointer to give her team
some breathing room, followed by
a dazzling drive and a jumper.
"I just got some good shots and
they were going in," said Powell.
"We were playing at their tempo
and we had to start playing our
game. It was really tough for us to
take our shots so 1 felt that 1 needed
to open it up by taking some shots."
Senior forward Bethany
Donaphin stepped up defensively
with a huge block in the paint that
had her team and the crowd on
their feet and sparked a 14-2 Stan
ford run in the remaining three

minutes of the half.
Donaphin finished with nine
points and 12 boards, dominating
the lane.
"I am concerned with our team
being aggressive and coming out
ready to play," said Donaphin. "I'll
take my matchup and do what I
need to do."
Oregon State, not ready to see its
postseason chances end, came back
hard in the second half pushing a
20-7 run in the opening minutes.
The rest of the team took their
cues from Powell, pouring on the
heat to finish strong on both ends
of the court.
Stanford came into Sunday's
game after defeating the Bruins
96-61 on Saturday.
That was the team's first expe
rience playing without Yamasaki
and the hesitation and uncertain
ty on the team was obvious as the
game remained scoreless for the
first three minutes.
Senior guard Lauren St. Clair,
who started in place of Yamasaki,
opened up the offense by knock
ing in a three-pointer on her way
to scoring 12 points on the night.
St. Clair was only the first ex
ample of great shooting as Stan
ford shot the lights out of
McArthur Court, making nine
three-pointers in the game.
No one was more prolific from be
hind the arc than freshman sharp
shooter Sebnem Kimyacioglu.
Kimyacioglu, a swingman,
followed St. Clair's three with
one of her own, finishing with
14 points after making a game

high four three-pointers.
Stanford also got great help on
the inside, beginning with senior
forward Enjoli Izidor. I lei drives
electrified her team and c ulminat
ed in a successful three-point-play
just before t he close of the half.
But the biggest contribution
from the bench came from reserve
forward Azella Perryman.
The freshman scored a career
high 17 points that included going
11 for 12 from the free throw line.
"I thought we had different peo
ple step up really well for us," said
VanDerveer. "Seb[nem] came in
and really put it up from the three,
Azella came in and did a great job
rebounding and making her free
throws. It was a good start for us."
"They just have threat after
threat after threat," said UCLA
head coach Kathy Olivier.
Stanford wants to add to its
already impressive season
tonight by capturing the first
Pac-10 tournament title in its
meeting with Arizona State.
The Cardinal won both of
the previous meetings this sea
son, though the Sun Devils are
the best defensive team in the
league and will be looking to
capitalize on any lingering con
fusion in Stanford's offense due
to Yamasaki's absence.
Arizona State pulled
through some physical games
against Arizona and Oregon in
order to meet the Cardinal in
tonight's final. The Sun Devils
are fighting to win the Pac-10's
automatic bid into the NCAAs.

Senior center Cori Enghusen powers it up strong. The Cardinal will need
more of the same tonight when it faces Arizona State in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Tournament Championship.
