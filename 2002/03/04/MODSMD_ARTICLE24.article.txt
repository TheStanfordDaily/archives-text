# Stanford silences NIT talk with two wins in Arizona
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
TEMPE, Ariz. â€” One week
ago, the mention of three little
letters had insulted Casey Jacob
sen. 11 had caused Tony Giovac
chini to shake his head in disbe
lief, and it had made the rest of
Stanford's players cringe.
But after a sweep of the Arizona
schools, capped oil by a 81-76 victo
ry over the Sun Devils on Saturday,
those letters have been replaced.
N.I.T. is now U.S.C.
The No. 17 Cardinal (19-8, 12-6
Pacific 10 Conference), whose 19
regular-season wins practically as-

sures itself of an NCAA berth, will
lace Southern California in the first
round of the Pac-10 Conference
Tournament which starts Thurs
day in Los Angeles.
Cardinal fans can only hope that
these new letters motivate Stan
ford's players as much as the old
ones did. USC is the only confer
ence team the Cardinal has not
beaten this season.
"We really have something to
prove," freshman swingman Josh

Childress said.
Do they ever.
Of course, proving themselves
isn't unfamiliar territory. The Car
dinal certainly silenced its critics by
clinching a tie for second place in
the conference and finishing as the
only Pac-10 team to complete a
road sweep of the Arizona schools.
Stanford has now won six of its last
eight games.
"It's a pretty good bounce back
from last week. To get a sweep on
this trip is spectacular," coach Mike
Montgomery said. "It shows charac
ter that these kids can come out like
that. They showed some courage."
Much like it had two nights ear
lier in an upset over No. 14 Arizona,
Stanford hung tough down the
stretch against the Sun Devils (14-
13, 7-11) in front of 6,992 at Wells
Fargo Arena. Giovacchini, a senior
point guard, andjunior center Cur
tis Borchardt combined to convert
11 of 12 free throws in the final 1:30
to keep the Cardinal ahead of a
surging Arizona State team.
"If we don't make free throws,
we probably don't win this game,"
Montgomery said.
On the other hand, Arizona
State, which had cut Stanford's lead
to 67-65 with 2:25 to play, missed
16 free throws in the game, includ
ing four in the final minute.
Junior wingman Casey Jacobsen
scored a team-high 29 points and
Borchardt tallied his 14th double
double of the season with 19 points
and 17 rebounds. Junior guard
Julius Barnes added 16.
Time and again, Jacobsen,
who scored 49 points against
Arizona State last month, at
tacked the slower Sun Devil de
fense and drew fouls. He was 7
of 16 from the field and 14 of 18
from the free throw line.
Borchardt, who played just 28
minutes because of foul trouble
in the first half, hounded the
smaller Arizona State defense
and was admittedly animated
and emotional on the court.
When Borchardt was side
lined, Barnes single-handedly
kept the Cardinal in the game.
He went 4 of 5 from 3-point land
in the first half despite playing
with a swollen right ankle.
"It's just something that comes
with the territory. You've got to

a much more balanced Cardinal scoring attack to two pivotal road victories.
play when you're hurt sometimes,
especially when these games are as
important as this," Barnes said.
The first 10 minutes had the
look of a letdown game, as
Stanford's offense appeared
stagnant. Not only did the Car
dinal shoot 29.2 percent in the
first fifteen minutes, it also
turned the ball over 11 times.
But all of a sudden, as unexpect
ed as Montgomery picking up his
second technical foul of the season,
it happened: Two Barnes threes. A
Jacobsen runner and then an open
jumper in the lane. Another Barnes
thi ee. Just like that, the Cardinal
had completed a 16-4 run to end
the half ahead, 37-32.
Again, resen'es played impor
tant role, as Childress, who had
struggled for much of the game,
grabbed an important offensive
board and put in an easy layup with
1:30 to play to extend the Cardi
nal's lead to 69-65.
Sophomore forward Joe
Kirchofer also added two put
back layups and sophomore
forward Justin Davis picked up
seven rebounds.
The Sun Devils, a dangerous
team that had beaten Oregon and
Arizona at home and UCLA on the
road, never trailed by more than
nine points.

After sitting out of the first
contest against the Trojans and
being limited to only 10 points
last week, Borchardt will have
another chance against USC
this Thursday at 3:30 p.m.
"Last time they blocked me out
pretty well. We're just going to
have to go back and work on that
and maybe I'll even get out in the
perimeter and shoot. I'll do what
ever I can," Borchardt said.
Regardless, the entire Stanford
team has redemption on its mind.
Said Montgomery: "We're fired
up to play USC."
