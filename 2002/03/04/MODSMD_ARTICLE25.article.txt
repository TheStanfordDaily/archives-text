Junior John 1 ludgins didn't say much alter pitch
ing 6 1/2 nearly-perfect innings yesterday in his bid to
capture the (Cardinal's No. 3 starting role, but his per
formance spoke for itself: "Next question."
With three dominant performances on offense
and solid outings from — surprise, surprise — ;ill
three starting pitchers, the top-ranked (Cardinal com
pleted its first series sweep of the season with three
wins over Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo this weekend at
Sunken Diamond.
At least for now, Hudgins settled the nagging
question of who would become Stanford's third start
ing pitcher behind fellow juniors Jeremy (".uihrie and
Tim Cunningham. His career-high eight strikeouts

" That's where I wanted to be at the beginning of
the season, in that third starter role," Hudgins said
after his first start of 2002. "What happened today
was probably going to dictate a lot of what happens
the rest of the season, so you definitely think of it as

Pitcher John Hudgins records another strike with this pitch. The sophomore helped the Cardinal to an 11 -3 vic

somewhat of an audition."
Head coach Mark Marquess
wouldn't concede anything past
next Sunday's start in Berkeley, but
he expressed relief that someone
grabbed hold of the job that trou
bled the Cardinal lor the first month
of the year.
"Hudgins pitched phenomenal
ly and was dominant out there
today," he said. "To have somebody
step up and pitch well like that helps
us out a lot."
Stanford jumped on Cal Poly
early on, scoring twice in the first
and then seven times in the 11-
batter second with junior out
fielder Jason Cooper's sacrifice
fly and double driving in one run
apiece.
Sophomore light fielder Carlos
Quentin's triple in the second
drove home the Cardinal's ninth

run of (lie ballgame, and with
Hudgins dealing a stellar game
on the mound, Stanford never
looked back.
Things unraveled a bit for
Hudgins in his seventh inning of
work. After amassing a career
high in innings pitched, he al
lowed his only walk of the game
and then two straight singles be
fore Marquess relieved him with
junior Darin Naatjes. Hudgins left
the game to a standing ovation
from a huge Sunday crowd of
3,105 but watched his sparkling
day tarnish a bit as all three of his
base runners crossed the plate
later in the inning.
On Saturday, fans saw the Cardi
nal explode for season highs with
four homers and 18 runs in an ab
solute drubbing of the Mustangs.
On the strength of an eight-run sec
ond inning and a six-run sixth,
Stanford cruised to the 18-5 victory
in which it brought 48 batters to the
plate.
Cooper finally picked up his first

home run of the season, a line drive
to light in the sixth. Though her
alded for his power, a new approach
at the plate this season left him with
16 singles out of 20 hits belore Sat
urday's bomb.
"Right now I'm swinging early
in the count and getting really
good pitches to hit," Cooper said.
"1 haven't put any pressure on my
self to hit home runs, but even so, to
get the first one this weekend was
really nice."
Marquess added: "I wasn't too
concerned because 1 knew the
home runs would come. He's re
ally swinging the bat well right
now with good balance and he's
really a tough out that's helping
ns a great deal in the middle of
the order."
Senior infielder Andy Topham,
junior catcher Ryan Garko and
freshman infielder Chris Carter
also belted Stanford homers on
Saturday. Topham injured his
hamstring while taking his home
run trot and missed Sunday's

game. Marquess said that if
Topham cannot play at California,
he should certainly return for the
Cardinal's next series against No.
14 Texas.
Cunningham was not as strong
as he was in last week's victory over
Santa Clara but pitched well enough
to earn his 10th consecutive win and
to improve to 4-0 this year.
Finally, Guthrie carried the Car
dinal for eight innings on Friday
night by striking out eight and walk
ing just one, picking up his fourth
win. Staying in the dugout for the
ninth, Guthrie watched two reliev
ers, senior J.I). Willcox and junior
Ryan McCally, almost squander a
six-run lead before closing out the 8-
6 win. The Mustangs rallied with six
straight batters — including four
pinch hitters—reaching base on
lour hits and two walks. With a man
on third and the tying run at the
plate, McCally induced a lineout to
left field for the last out of the game
to preserve the win and earn his
third save of the year.
