### VESSELA STOYANOVA EDITORIAL STAFF 
A flashback to last year's Pacific-10 Conference
Championships brings back painful memories. Despite
winning 13 of the 21 events, the Stanford women's
swimming and diving team finished in a disappointing
fourth place. The reason: lack of depth on a talented but
small roster.
Fastfbrward to this year's Pac-lOs, with the top

For the first time since 1999, Stanford left the con

a fourteenth Pac-10 crown to its trophy case.

It captured the title with a total of 1320.5 points, fol
lowed by USC. (1197.5) and Arizona (1151.5).
"The Pac-10 is by far the finest swimming conference
and it's a real accomplishment to win it," said head coach
Richard Quick.
Many records fell to the talented stjuad. Sophomore
l ara Kirk broke the American record in the 100-yard
breast stroke with a time of 58.08 seconds. She also set a
new Stanford mark in the 200 breast-stroke (2:07.79),
despite finishing second to Arizona
State University's Agnes Kovacs, the
reigning Olympic champion in the
meter version of the event.
"I'hat was a phenomenal race.
Kirk is getting closer and closer to
[Kovacs]," Quick said.
Senior Shelly Ripple won three
individual events. She defended her
Pac-10 title in the 200 individual
medley and set a new Pac-10 meet
record with a season-best time of
1:56.64. Ripple also eclipsed the old
meet record by winning the 200
butterlly in a time of 1:53.50, the
second-test mark ever at Stanford.
"She came within an eyelash of
the American record in the 200 fly,"
Quick said.
Ripple's victory in the 100 but
terlly (52.16) rounded out her trio
of individual wins.
According to Quick, this year's
addition of new swimmers to the
team roster "made a tremendous
difference in the meet from a
depth standpoint," enabling Stan
lord to win the meet with both
quality and depth.

"We won more first places than
any other school in the meet. Even
in the events we weren't first, in
many cases we were second," Quick
said.
Freshman sprint-free specialist
lxicey Boutwell won her first career
Pac-10 title with a mark of 22.93 in
the 50 freestyle. Stanford's 400
medley relay team of Kirk, Ripple,
and freshmen Amy Wagner and
Sarah (ones was also victorious, at a
time of 3:36.55, the Cardinal's best
this season.
Senior Jessica Foschi tcx>k the

year. However, the defending
NCAA champion in the 500
freestyle was upset by Arizona's
Emily Mason, who broke Foschi's
18-race win streak in the event.
In addition to the depth of the
swimming squad, the Stanford
divers also racked up many points
to contribute to the Cardinal's first
place finish.
"Our diving was just fantastic,"
Quick said. "The points we scored
in diving made the difference in
