# Track makes use of final qualifier
## 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
llic Husky Last Chance Quali
fier, held in Seattle on Saturday,
was indeed the final opportunity
for Stanford athletes to gain entry
into the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships.
l he Cardinal rose to the occa
sion, posting one automatic and
eight provisional qualifying
marks for the NCAAs.
An athlete with an automatic
qualifying score is guaranteed a
spot at the championships.
Few athletes achieve this high
standard during the course of the
regular season, leaving the rest of
the NCAA slots to be filled by the
top provisional qualifiers.
The NCAA will announce the
provisional-qualifier cutoffs to
morrow, and the Cardinal will
know how many of its athletes will
compete at the Championships.
Given Saturday's stellar per
formances, that number could be
quite high.
1 he Cardinal women posted a
remarkable three individual
event victories.
; Junior pole-vaulter Kathleen
jDonoghue, senior middle-dis
tance runner Maurica Carlucci
and freshman distance runner
Sara Bei topped the field with vic
tories in the pole vault, the 800
meters and the 3,000 meters, re
spectively.
Donoghue recorded a jump of
12 feet-9 1/2 inches, while Carluc
ci posted a time of 2:07.51 — less
than a second shy of an automatic
qualifier.
Carlucci was followed closely
by her teammate, junior Lindsey
Hyatt, whose fifth-place time of
2:08.92 also provisionally quali
fied her for the NCAAs.
Bei's time of 9:26.19 placed
her over eight seconds ahead of
the nearest competitor and very
nearly made her an automatic
qualifier.
In other highlighted perfor

mances, sophomore Lindsey
johnson took second in the 60-
meter hurdles. Her time of 8.42
seconds was just one-hundredth
of <i second under the provisional
qualifying standard.
Stanford's only automatic
qualifier of the day came from
sophomore middle-distance run
ner Don Sage. Sage placed second
in the men's mile with a time of
3:59.49.
Sophomores Grant Robison
and Andy Powell also competed
in the mile, but did not finish, rab
bitting for Sage instead.
The men's 3,000 meters had
the strongest Cardinal represen
tation in the meet, with three ath
letes posting provisional qualify
ing times.
Sophomore Chris Emine, ju
nior Jesse Thomas and sopho
more lan Dobson grabbed the
race's fourth through sixth spots,
with times of 7:58.15,8:03.86 and
8:04.08, respectively.
While provisional, Emme's
time will almost certainly earn
him a spot in the NCAA Champi
onships, where he will have the
option of running both the 5,000
and the 3,000-meter races in his
first championship meet.
"I'm so glad everything has
come together so far this season,"
Emme said. "I'm really excited
about getting to run at nationals
for the first time; I hope this is the
first of many."
Many Cardinal athletes placed
well in the meet but fell just short
of provisionally qualifying for the
NCAAs.
On the men's side, junior Mil
ton Little placed second in the
men's long jump with a mark of
22 feet-9 1/2 inches. Senior Steve
Loughlin's eighth-place time of
4:06.97 was only one second over
the provisional standard. Fellow
senior Mark Hassell took second
in the 800 meters in 1:52.14.
For the women, senior Caro
line Annis took Fifth in the
women's 5,000 meters in a time of

17:08.54 while junior Erin Sulli
van placed fifth in the 3,000 me
ters in 9:39.20.
Fhe Cardinal will carry the
momentum from the Husky

Qualifier into next weekend's
NCAA Indoor Championships,
where it will have a much
stronger representation thanks to
Saturday's performances.

An athlete with an automatic
qualifying score is guaranteed a
spot at the championships.
Few athletes achieve this high
standard during the course of the
regular season, leaving the rest of
the NCAA slots to be filled by the
top provisional qualifiers.
The NCAA will announce the
provisional-qualifier cutoffs to
morrow, and the Cardinal will
know how many of its athletes will
compete at the Championships.
Given Saturday's stellar per
formances, that number could be
quite high.
1 he Cardinal women posted a
remarkable three individual
event victories.
; Junior pole-vaulter Kathleen
jDonoghue, senior middle-dis
tance runner Maurica Carlucci
and freshman distance runner
Sara Bei topped the field with vic
tories in the pole vault, the 800
meters and the 3,000 meters, re
spectively.
Donoghue recorded a jump of
12 feet-9 1/2 inches, while Carluc
ci posted a time of 2:07.51 — less
than a second shy of an automatic
qualifier.
Carlucci was followed closely
by her teammate, junior Lindsey
Hyatt, whose fifth-place time of
2:08.92 also provisionally quali
fied her for the NCAAs.
Bei's time of 9:26.19 placed
her over eight seconds ahead of
the nearest competitor and very
nearly made her an automatic
qualifier.
In other highlighted perfor

mances, sophomore Lindsey
johnson took second in the 60-
meter hurdles. Her time of 8.42
seconds was just one-hundredth
of <i second under the provisional
qualifying standard.
Stanford's only automatic
qualifier of the day came from
sophomore middle-distance run
ner Don Sage. Sage placed second
in the men's mile with a time of
3:59.49.
Sophomores Grant Robison
and Andy Powell also competed
in the mile, but did not finish, rab
bitting for Sage instead.
The men's 3,000 meters had
the strongest Cardinal represen
tation in the meet, with three ath
letes posting provisional qualify
ing times.
Sophomore Chris Emine, ju
nior Jesse Thomas and sopho
more lan Dobson grabbed the
race's fourth through sixth spots,
with times of 7:58.15,8:03.86 and
8:04.08, respectively.
While provisional, Emme's
time will almost certainly earn
him a spot in the NCAA Champi
onships, where he will have the
option of running both the 5,000
and the 3,000-meter races in his
first championship meet.
"I'm so glad everything has
come together so far this season,"
Emme said. "I'm really excited
about getting to run at nationals
for the first time; I hope this is the
first of many."
Many Cardinal athletes placed
well in the meet but fell just short
of provisionally qualifying for the
NCAAs.
On the men's side, junior Mil
ton Little placed second in the
men's long jump with a mark of
22 feet-9 1/2 inches. Senior Steve
Loughlin's eighth-place time of
4:06.97 was only one second over
the provisional standard. Fellow
senior Mark Hassell took second
in the 800 meters in 1:52.14.
For the women, senior Caro
line Annis took Fifth in the
women's 5,000 meters in a time of

17:08.54 while junior Erin Sulli
van placed fifth in the 3,000 me
ters in 9:39.20.
Fhe Cardinal will carry the
momentum from the Husky

Qualifier into next weekend's
NCAA Indoor Championships,
where it will have a much
stronger representation thanks to
Saturday's performances.

Freshman Sara Bei is seen running here during cross country season earlier
this year. She, along with several other members of the Cardinal's Indoor
track and field team, qualified for the NCAA championships last Saturday.
