# Beloved earthquake engineer dies
## Blume remembered for intelligence, patience, quick wit 
### VAUHINI VARA EDITORIAL STAFF 
John Blume, founder of the John A.
Blume Earthquake Engineering Center,
died Friday at his home in Hillsborough.
He was 92.
Blume, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1933, has been dubbed by his col
leagues as "the father of earthquake en
gineering." He was a consulting profes
sor in the Civil and Environmental En
gineering Department and was consid
ered one of the world's leading scholars

in the field of earth
quake engineering.
"He will be sorely
missed by all those who
were privileged to
have known him," said
Racquel Hagen, ad
ministrative associate
at the Blume Center.
"He was a mentor,

he was an inspiration,"
said Blume Center Director Anne
Kiremidjian, who has'known Blume for
29 years. "He really took me under his
guidance. 1 was really fortunately to
have known him at the time."
Blume was born April »S, 1909. His fa
ther participated in the rebuilding of
San Francisco after the 1906 earth
quake, including the renovation of the

Palace Hotel — a building that would
end up playing an integral role in
Blume's work.
While working for his father as a steel
erector and rigger, Blume witnessed the
destruction of Santa Barbara in 1925 by
a 6.3 earthquake and helped with the
rescue work. This experience played a
major role in shaping Blume's future
work, instilling in him the desire to "do
something" about earthquakes.
As a student at Stanford, Blume was
known for his sense of humor and his
sports car escapades. When he was an
undergraduate, he once drove from
Stanford to Lake Tahoe in four hours,
evading the law the entire way — con
sidered quite a feat in the early 19305.


Blume
After earning his degree,
Blume spent several years working
privately as an engineer. In 1945,
he established John A. Blume and
Associates, which soon became a
premier consulting firm in struc
tural and earthquake engineering.
Blume returned to Stanford in
1964, at the age of 55, to earn his
doctorate. Still heading his con
sulting firm, Blume took courses
for one year. He asked for no spe
cial treatment as he pursued his
degree in the same manner as
other students, spending several
all-night sessions working at the
computer center.
Blume published over 150 pa
pers, articles and books and re
ceived several awards, including
the American Society of Civil En

gineers' annual Ernest t. Howard
and Leon S. Moisseiff awards.
He founded the Blume Center
in 1974 and said it was devoted to
the advancement of research, ed
ucation and practice in earth
quake engineering. Since its in
ception, the center has functioned
as the umbrella for all earthquake
engineering activities at Stanford.
"He always thought that Stan
ford should be one of the leading
institutions in earthquake engi
neering," Kiremidjian said.
According to Kiremidjian, the
projects that Blume used to assign
were the most difficult but also the
most interesting and exciting.
"He really knew how to present
material in a very succinct, very
clear way," Kiremidjian said. "He
always made the point very pre
cise. He was incredibly bright, in
credibly witty, a true professional.
He loved a professional argument
— and he always won."

Blurne's influence on the Stan
ford community extended well
beyond academics. According to
Kiremidjian, Blurne treated col
leagues with patience and respect.
"The way he approached me
and colleagues and younger engi
neers was as a caring father," she
said. "The care and the under
standing and the patience he had
was remarkable."
When Stanford received two
gifts to be used to pay him for life,
Blume decided to give the money
back to the University by endow
ing a chair, the John A. Blume
Professorship.
"He was truly respected by the
entire engineering community,"
Kiremidjian said.
A memorial service will be held
at Memorial Church — "to cele
brate his extraordinary accom
plishments and contributions to
our profession and to our lives,"
Hagen said.
