John Blume, founder of the John A.
Blume Earthquake Engineering Center,
died Friday at his home in Hillsborough.
He was 92.
Blume, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1933, has been dubbed by his col
leagues as "the father of earthquake en
gineering." He was a consulting profes
sor in the Civil and Environmental En
gineering Department and was consid
ered one of the world's leading scholars

in the field of earth
quake engineering.
"He will be sorely
missed by all those who
were privileged to
have known him," said
Racquel Hagen, ad
ministrative associate
at the Blume Center.
"He was a mentor,

he was an inspiration,"
said Blume Center Director Anne
Kiremidjian, who has'known Blume for
29 years. "He really took me under his
guidance. 1 was really fortunately to
have known him at the time."
Blume was born April »S, 1909. His fa
ther participated in the rebuilding of
San Francisco after the 1906 earth
quake, including the renovation of the

Palace Hotel — a building that would
end up playing an integral role in
Blume's work.
While working for his father as a steel
erector and rigger, Blume witnessed the
destruction of Santa Barbara in 1925 by
a 6.3 earthquake and helped with the
rescue work. This experience played a
major role in shaping Blume's future
work, instilling in him the desire to "do
something" about earthquakes.
As a student at Stanford, Blume was
known for his sense of humor and his
sports car escapades. When he was an
undergraduate, he once drove from
Stanford to Lake Tahoe in four hours,
evading the law the entire way — con
sidered quite a feat in the early 19305.
