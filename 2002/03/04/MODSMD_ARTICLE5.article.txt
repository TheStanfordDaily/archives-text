### ERIKKA INNES STAFF WRITER 
Friday evening, dancers turned out
dressed in their finest to attend the 25th
annual Viennese Ball at the Fairmont
Hotel in San Jose.
The opening ceremony for the ball
began at 8:15 p.m. Master of Cere
monies Patrick Fleisch introduced the
evening's guests of honor and the
dancers in the opening performances of
a polka, ballet and waltz. Fleisch then de
clared the ball open, in both German
and English.
Guests at this year's ball were treated
to spacious dance floors, a lavish spread
of appetizers and special dance perfor
mances throughout the evening.
Repeat attendees noted that this year was
an improvement over previous years.
" This year is better than previous years
because there's more dancing space," said
one attendee. "1 don't like the Viennese Ball
as much as some of Stanford's other dances,
because the dancers here have much lower
skill levels."
Other guests at the Viennese Ball had
a more enthusiastic, die-hard attitude.
"' 1 he Viennese Ball is always so much fun
t hat I had to come back again this year," said
Stanford alumnus John Bauer, who now
works for G<x>gle. "I even missed my com

pany ski trip for this."
Dancers also enjoyed the music at
the Viennese Ball. Two live orchestras
were featured on separate dance floors
— the Brassworks Band played a selec
tion of Victorian Ballroom waltzes and

polkas and The Swing Solution played
big band music.
"The Viennese Ball is fun because of
the orchestras," junior Dustin Mat-

sumori said. " There's something
special about live music."
According to The Swing Solu
tion's singer Joyce McCulloch,
most of the people at the ball
agreed.
"90 percent of the people are
dancing and 10 percent are
watching," McCulloch said.
Frank Beau Davis, director and
co-founder of The Brassworks
Band, voiced a similar opinion.
"We seem to be popular here,"
Davis said. "It's a thrilling experi
ence, playing for such an appre
ciative audience."
Aside from performing music,
Davis said he also enjoys dancing.
"I love dancing," Davis said. "I
even went so far as to arrange my
self out of one of the waltzes so I
could dance with everyone."
Academy of Danse Libre Director
Edoardo Maragliano said he enjoyed

the evening because of the opportuni
ty to meet new people.
" I love dancing because of the part
nering, and the wonderful people
you meet," Maragliano said.
During the course of the
evening, Maragliano performed
in routines by the Stanford Vin
tage Dance Ensemble and the
Academy of Danse Libre.
Stanford's first Viennese Ball
was held in 1977, when students
returning from the Stanford-in-
Vienna program decided to bring
the ball tradition to the Universi
ty. At the time, the ball was a small
affair in Toyon Hall, attended by
350 students.
Over the years, the Viennese
Ball tradition has grown to in
clude Austria week — a set of
events leading to the ball, where
students receive samples of Aus
trian dance steps, music, food and
films.
Now the ball is such a popular
Stanford event that it is held off
campus to accommodate a large
number of guests.
