Friday evening, dancers turned out
dressed in their finest to attend the 25th
annual Viennese Ball at the Fairmont
Hotel in San Jose.
The opening ceremony for the ball
began at 8:15 p.m. Master of Cere
monies Patrick Fleisch introduced the
evening's guests of honor and the
dancers in the opening performances of
a polka, ballet and waltz. Fleisch then de
clared the ball open, in both German
and English.
Guests at this year's ball were treated
to spacious dance floors, a lavish spread
of appetizers and special dance perfor
mances throughout the evening.
Repeat attendees noted that this year was
an improvement over previous years.
" This year is better than previous years
because there's more dancing space," said
one attendee. "1 don't like the Viennese Ball
as much as some of Stanford's other dances,
because the dancers here have much lower
skill levels."
Other guests at the Viennese Ball had
a more enthusiastic, die-hard attitude.
"' 1 he Viennese Ball is always so much fun
t hat I had to come back again this year," said
Stanford alumnus John Bauer, who now
works for G<x>gle. "I even missed my com

pany ski trip for this."
Dancers also enjoyed the music at
the Viennese Ball. Two live orchestras
were featured on separate dance floors
â€” the Brassworks Band played a selec
tion of Victorian Ballroom waltzes and

polkas and The Swing Solution played
big band music.
"The Viennese Ball is fun because of
the orchestras," junior Dustin Mat-
