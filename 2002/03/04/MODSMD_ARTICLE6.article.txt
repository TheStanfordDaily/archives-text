# Dekes caught stealing goat
## Esperson says he only planned to "borrow" animal for a few hours

Are goats the new hot commodity for frater
nity boys? On Feb. 24, three Delta Kappa Ep
silon members, including junior Dustin Es
persen, the Stanford chapter president, and
UC-Berkeley's Timothy Faye and Samuel
Manhoff, were arrested for attempting to steal
a goat from theTilden Nature Area.
East Bay Regional Parks Sgt. Scott Iversen
said in The Daily Californian that Espersen,
Faye and Manhoff were under suspicion for
grand theft of livestock and conspiracy as well as
violation of park curfew.
According to Espersen, all charges have
been dropped. He claims that the suspects
had only the intent to "borrow" the goat fora
maximum of four hours, which negates the
allegations of theft, as theft implies the intent
to steal.
"DKE will always be first and foremost about
having fun in a safe, legal mannerâ€” I think
that mission continues as successfully as ever."
Espersen said.
Grand theft of livestock is considered a
felony under the California Penal Code. Es
persen said the charge was ridiculously blown

out of proportion. A charge of "grand theft" is
inaccurate, according to Espersen, since the
group could easily purchase a goat "for $60 at
Half Moon Bay."
"We found the idea humorous at the time,
but we learned from this experience that
some ideas, however empirically funny, are
simply not meant to be implemented," Es
persen said.
Espersen was in the car during the arrest
and the attempted "borrowing." He said that
he has not seen a goat in years and that he
thought that the police would have a sense of
humor about it. However, the sergeant ar
rived and, according to Espersen, "this turned
the citation into an arrest."
"It took them about three hours to figure out
the maximum charge they could give us before
we left Tilden Park," Espersen said. "We would
have returned the goat before that time had we
not been caught."
"We are still reviewing the actions taken by
[Espersen]," said Ricardo Martinez, I)KE
sergeant of arms. "It will be dealt with in a re
sponsible, appropriate manner."
Martinez noted that Espersen was sober
during what he calls "Goat Incident '02," and
that he has been "honest and cooperative" re
garding the allegations.
"Dustin is a forthright, responsible individ
ual of unrivaled intelligence," Martinez said.
Espersen alluded to the goat "mystique" as a jx>s
sible reason for all the goat traditions out there.

"It will probably go down in history as one of
the funniest things that has ever happened to
the chapter," said junior Josh Bat tel, DKE fi
nancial manager.
Junior Brendan Raven said the incident
might change the Dekes' image to one of "goat
[expletives]," Raven said. "But if our image was
our first priority, we wouldn't Ik- having nearly as
much fun as we are."
