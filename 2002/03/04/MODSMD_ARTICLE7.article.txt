### JOHN CARLSON 
Brutacao delivered the opening
remarks, stating that the project
was called Pumpkin Pie because
"it got started in November,
pumpkin pie tastes good and,
well, it just seemed like a good
idea at the time."
Kinney delivered several
performances, taking on
roles like an incessant coffee
drinking student, a cartoon
whose only wish is to become
a real boy, a man who learns
Death has come for him six
days earlier than planned
and many others.
A comical performance was
that of director Brooke Han
son's "Antigone: A Musical Re
vival," in which the trio of
sophomore Ali 800/er and se
niors Val Sinckler and Lauren
Heiser acted as ladies of an
cient Greece singing in hopes
of reviving the dead Oedi
pus — played by Kinney —

In an overflowing Annen
berg Auditorium, the Stanford
Film Society's "Pumpkin Pie
Project" lit up the silver screen
Friday night.
The project challenged 10
filmmakers to write, direct and
edit a short film that each ended
with the same shot — the
strange death of senior Zack
Kinney falling to the ground in
Toyon's courtyard while hold
ing a metallic container. The re
sult was, according to attendees,
a hilarious, horrific, musical,
dramatic and sexual collection
of scenes that represented the
creativity of Stanford's student
filmmakers.
Producer and director Malt
from the grave.
"Pumpkin Pie was a way for*
experienced directors to create a
sense of community among
themselves and let their own
styles show through," said sopho
more Ed Iskandar, who directed
a film entitled "Two" as part of
the project.
In addition to participating in
the project, Iskandar directed
"Dangerous Liaisons," a play that
premiered Feb. 25. Although
primarily a theater director, he
hopes his films and plays "can
contribute to the Stanford com
munity by bringing together dif
ferent forms of creativity and ex
perimentation."
The project's other directors
included Brady Beaubien, Justin
Guerrieri, Ryan Lohbauer,
Stephanie Gerson, Jodie Ellis,
Jacob Klein and J.J. McKeever.
