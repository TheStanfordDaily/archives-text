Art finds a home at Google
MOUNTAIN VIEW (AP) — During the Olympics,
when a speed-skating fox, a bear pushing a curling
stone and other cutesy images adorned the "Google"
logo on the popular Internet search engine, hundreds
of users wrote in to compliment the art department.
That provoked a lot of laughs at Google headquar
ters, because the "art department" actually is just one
guy: Dennis Hwang, a 23-year-old Web programmer
who whips up the doodles in his spare time, usually
for holidays.
Hwang's signature move is to coyly play oil the letters in
"(i(K)gle," especially those two ()s no doodler could resist.
He has turned them into pumpkins, globes, a Nobel
Prize medal, a hot key puck and a stopwatch. The L often
becomes a llagpole, such as on Bastille Day, when it sup
ported a French banner.
Sometimes every letter gets involved. Hwang hon
ored C llaude Monet's birthday last year by giving the logo
a muted watercolor look, with little lily pads underneath.
Hwang majored in art at Stanford University, with
a minor in computer science. But for these frivolous
designs he relies more on skills he developed while
growing up in South Korea, where often he found
himself doodling in his notebooks instead of listening
to teachers.

State posts sex offender
information on the Internet
SAN JOSE (AP) — Public information on registered sex
offenders now will be available in 13 languages and will be
updated daily, Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Friday.
Law enforcement agencies will be able to obtain and
give daily updates of Megan's Law information by ac
cessing a Department ol Justice database via a secure In
tranet connection. The new Web-enabled application re
places a CD-ROM produced by the attorney general's of
fice and distributed monthly to law enforcement.
Megan's Law allows public access to information on
the identities and whereabouts of most of the state's reg
istered sex offenders.
That information is available in three ways: police and
sheriffs departments may notify residents of a nearby
sex offender; citizens may call (900) 448-3000, or they
may view information at a law enforcement agency. Cal
ifornia has 93,000 registered sex offenders.

of some of the instructors had turned into an orgy and
included a game in which partygoers took Polaroids of
their genitalia and challenged players to match the shots
to their owners.
The university is investigating. "Those activities were

The course was offered by the university through a pro
gram that allows students to design their own for-credit
courses, which are supposed to be overseen by professors.
