"Creating economic opportunity far
people is one of the most effective
ways of creating social change.
We are part of an economic system
whether we 're conscious of it or not,
whether we believe it or not."

What will it take to be a productive
business leader in the 21st century?
We believe that it will take more than sound economic practices in a world of
increasingly complex interdependence. It will require • contribution to the social
progress necessary in a healthy and evolving society • the vision and expertise to
employ information and decision technology in ways that enhance human as well
as economic capital • an understanding of the broader implications of local,
national and global commerce.
