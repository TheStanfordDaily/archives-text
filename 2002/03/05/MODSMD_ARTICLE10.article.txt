# Simon sentenced to three-year term
## Student had pled no contest to charges last spring 
### SARAH SCHULMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alexander Simon, a 26-year-old
graduate student in cancer biology, re
ceived a three-year sentence last week
for attempting to commit lewd and las
civious acts with a child. Simon lured a
10-year-old girl into an e-mail corre
spondence and set up a meeting with
her at a hotel.
As reported in The Daily last spring,
Simon was arrested May 17 on the
charge of attempted lewd and lascivious
acts with a child.
Simon met the girl while volunteer
ing as a safety instructor at a Menlo Park
elementary school. He first e-mailed
her a cartoon of rabbits mating, and the
e-mails became more explicit as there

lationship progressed, reported Stan
ford Magazine.
The girl's father discovered the e
mail relationship and contacted the San
Mateo County Sherrifs Department.
Detectives then took over the girl's e
mail account, and exchanged a total of
17 e-mails over a one-month period.
Finally, Simon e-mailed the girl
proposing that they get together fora
smoothie and then drive to a remote lo
cation to engage in sexual acts. A meet
ing was set up in the parking lot of the
Stanford Park Hotel in Menlo Park. San
Mateo county sheriffs deputies met the
suspect there and took him into custody
without incident.
"This investigation would not have
been possible without a father who was
astute enough to pay attention to what
his daughter was doing on the Inter
net . . . Thank God for him or else we
would have never known about this,"
Hoss told the San Jose Mercury News in
May. "She could very well be with
Simon todav."

Investigators seized Simon's com
puter and other evidence from his Stan
ford residence in order to look for other
victims.
Simon pleaded no-contest to all
charges. Although Simon taught at five
other schools, there is no evidence of
any other illegal acts.
I.ucile Packard Children's Hospital,
which runs the program Simon was in
volved in, fired him following his arrest.
According to the hospital's written state
ment, Simon had worked at the hospital
since 1997.
"We are not aware of any informa
tion in the suspect's background that
would have alerted anyone to the po
tential for this kind of problem," the
statement said.
Eric Geffon, Simon's lawyer, empha
sized his client's remorse and the im
portance of the rehabilitation process.
"Alex has always taken full responsi
bility for what happened and is very
eager to continue counseling," Geffon
told the Mercury News.
