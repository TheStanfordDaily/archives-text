RAMALIvMI, West Bank (AP) â€” Israel sent war
planes and tanks against Palestinian targets yester
day, killing the wife and three children of a Hamas
militant in what the military said was a mistake. In all,
10 Palestinians died in retaliatory raids.
The multiple strikes in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip followed a Cabinet decision Sunday to in
tensify military action after Israel was left reeling from
Palestinian bombing and shooting attacks that killed
22 Israelis over the weekend.
After nightfall, Israeli F-16 warplanes bombed
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's headquarters
compound in Bethlehem, Palestinian officials said.
There were no reports of casualties. The building
had been evacuated for days in expectation of an
Israeli attack.
Witnesses said the warplanes set two security build
ings on fire. Palestinian security official Ahmed Abdel
Rahman condemned the attack, calling it "dangerous
escalation."
The Israeli military said the attacks were a "re
sponse to murderous attacks of the past few days."
"We are in a war over our home and the war is hor
rible," Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told parliament,
vowing Israel will not succumb to what he has de

scribed as a relentless campaign of Palestinian terror.
"I am sure in the end that we will win and peace
will come to this home," Sharon said.
Sharon said the Palestinians must absorb punish
ment to learn that terrorism does not pay.
The past week has seen some of the worst violence
in the 17 months of Mideast fighting, with repeated
international efforts failing to end the bloodshed and
each side claiming they had no choice but to hit back
at the other.
"The response will be hard, and the Zionist enemy
will understand that it is going to pay a high price,"
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the militant
Islamic movement Hamas, said Monday.
The Palestinian Authority demanded immediate
international intervention to stop "this barbaric Is
raeli aggression against our people and our land."
In the deadliest episode, an Israeli tank shell fired
from long distance slammed into a pickup truck,
killing the wife of a Hamas militant, Abu Kweik, and
the couple's three children.
"I swear to God they will pay a very high price for
this crime," Kweik said. "We will continue our resis
tance until it's the end of the last [Israelii soldier on
our lands."
