## The
						Stanford Daily LSJUMB's behavior necessitates tighter sanctions 
### 
Published Since 1891

We support the recent action by
the Dean of Students Office to
suspend the Stanford Band
from traveling to the men's and
women's Pacific 10 Conference basketball
tournaments. The Band's recent violation of
its alcohol probation — not to mention its vi
olation of basic health standards — necessi
tates severe sanctions.
Late last week custodial crews discovered
the Band Shak in filthy conditions with a
feral odor of vomit. There were containers of
alcohol discarded in the Band Shak, includ
ing at least one keg. The custodians charged
with cleaning the Band Shak took the right
action by refusing to clean up the Band's
post-party mess and reporting the situation
to their superiors.
The Dean of Students has instituted an ap
propriate restriction for the Band by pro-

hibiting it from traveling. The Band's leader
ship must learn that it cannot destroy Uni
versity property and violate University sanc
tions without repercussions. Alcohol proba
tion alone does not seem to have worked in
this case.
When the Band travels to other schools, it is
the representative of Stanford. A bad or offen
sive joke is one thing, but destruction of proper
ty is far worse. We can no longer trust the Band
to be a fitting ambassador for the University.
We are pleased that Band members even
tually took the initiative to clean the Band
Shak. But they never should have expected
custodians to clean up such a mess — and
more importantly, they never should have
made such a mess. The Band was on alcohol
probation and it should not have had any al
cohol at its events or on its premises. The
Band's blatant violation of alcohol probation

demonstrates that it had not yet learned the
lesson the probation was supposed to teach.
Regardless of whether the Band feels alco
hol probation is an appropriate punishment,
it must accept the punishment and change its
behavior accordingly. Not doing so will only
get the Band in further trouble.
While the Band must be appropriately
punished for this last violation in its long his
tory of infractions, it is important that the ir
responsible behavior of the Band does not
demoralize or hurt our athletic teams. The
Band's absence has already left the Cardinal
women at the Pac-10 tournament without
the spirit and encouragement that the danc
ing Tree and the echoes of "All Right Now"
provide. We hope that the same situation
does not continue in the future.
However bad the Band's behavior was, we
believe that it should be allowed to travel to the

men's and women's NCAA tournament. The
image of Stanford would be hurt without the
presence of the Band, and the teams would be
hurt without the spirit the Band provides.
However, the Band should only be allowed
to travel to the NCAA tournament with the
proviso that a number of chaperones from
the Athletic Department and Dean of Stu
dents Office accompany the Band. Some sort
of supervision of the Band is obviously need
ed both on trips and here at Stanford. By reg
ulating its behavior more stringently, the
University can hopefully prevent similar
problems and incidents in the future.
Only by stringently clamping down on the
Band's behavior can the University send the
message that the actions of last week — and of
recent history — will not be tolerated. The
Band is Stanford's ambassador to the world; we
should have an envoy of which we are proud.
