# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Is the museum trashed? 
### 
I took a trip out to the Cantor Aits
Center the other day. It's really a
fascinating place, only a stone's
throw away from the Main Quad. I
spent about an hour wandering through
the exhibits, checking out paintings and
sculptures from the Renaissance to the

Impressionists.
Eventually I turned
the corner into a room,
and thought fora sec
ond that I'd stumbled
into the storage closet. A
row of fluorescent lights
flickered on the wall in
front of me. One section
of the floor was covered
up by dozens of scuffed

metal tiles. A pile of Brillo pad boxes
stood precariously stacked in the corner.
Of course, as all you art connoisseurs
are aware, this was not storage closet. It
was a full-fledged exhibition gallery. And
all the random objects — the fluorescent
lights, metal tiles and the Brillo pads —
were actually masterpieces of contempo
rary Art.
In fact, the entire room was festooned
with Contemporary paintings and sculp
tures. Across from the fluorescent lights,
the folks at Cantor had hung a painting.
It consisted of a perfectly white canvass,
with a broad black stripe drawn across
the middle. Next to the painting stood a
large, rectangular block of wood, paint
ed a fetching shade of red. Not too far
away, one of the walls had been en
hanced by a series of iron rectangles
spread out in a row.
Willi all due respect, it seemed pretty
clear that anyone wha'd taken a basic
high school shop class and had a couple
hundred dollars to blow could have con
structed any of these works of art. As far
as technical skill is concerned, I'd seen
more impressive pieces or art on the
backs of cocktail napkins.
But then again, these works of art were
all about ideas. Each painting and sculp
ture came with a handy plaque explaining
the deep philosophical meaning behind
the work. For example, the metal tiles on
the floor were lauded as bridging the gap
between "traditional" art and worldly ob
ject, since they were set at ground level
and the viewer was free to walk all over
them. Other pieces had similar inscrip
tions. All this begs the question, What in
spires these Contemporary artists? What
gives them their unique vision?
I think the answer is marijuana. When
you get right down to it, marijuana
smokers and Contemporary artists are
the two groups of people who ascribe
deep, cosmic importance to the most
trivial and mundane objects.
Your average marijuana smoker
might finish a joint, scarf down a bag of
potato chips when the munchies hit, and

then deliver an impassioned, semi-co
herent soliloquy on the vast significance
of the empty potato chip bag. "Dude, this
bag is like a symbol," he'd say. "It's a sym
bol of all the greed in the world. You
know, we take the resources, the potato
chips, and all that's left is the empty bag.
No one stops to think about the bag, but
that's really where it all ends . . . ."
If the would-be philosopher is just
your average dope fancier, he'll eventu
ally forget about the bag and blearily
stumble off to bed. But if he happens to
be a Contemporary artist, then he might
decide to act on his newfound epiphany.
He'll save the bag, mount it on a
pedestal or stick it in a frame, and scrib
ble a brief explanation for why it has this
incredible, profound meaning. After his
agent edits out all the "dude" references,
you end up with a brand-new piece of
contemporary art, ready for display at
any of today's chic modern galleries.
Call me an uncultured philistine, but
it doesn't seem to me that any creative
endeavor is worthy of respect unless it in
volves technical skill.
Mr. Metal-'Tiles-on-the-Floor might
be trying to say something deep and pro
found, but if anyone with access to a
Home Depot could reproduce his re
sults, then I'm not about to give him a lot
of credit.
The same goes for other creative dis
ciplines, which thankfully have generally
steered away from the excesses of visual
art. If a novelist writes a book using sim
plistic plot lines and third-grade vocabu
lary, then it doesn't really matter what
kind of statement she was trying to make.
It's still a bad book.
If an orchestra performs a stirring
rendition of "Mary had a Little Lamb" as
the highlight of its concert, then it's a
pretty lame group of musicians. It
doesn't matter that they were trying to
deliver a biting commentary on some as
pect of American society.
But hey, maybe these Contemporary
artists are on to something. After all, if
galleries will pay them good money for
their jury-rigged collection of household
objects and nearly empty canvases, that's
not the artists' problem.
They're just c ranking out the supply to
meet the demand. Speaking of which, if
anyone from the Cantor Arts Center is
reading this column, I've got a great col
lection of my old grade-school art back
home. I'd even be willing to throw in some
random knick-knacks from my garage,
and I'll write the explanatory plaques my
self. Give me a call, and I'm sure we could
work out some kind of deal.
