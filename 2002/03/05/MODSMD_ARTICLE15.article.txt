# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## America is not honest about its own Taliban 
### JOSH KALLMAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
At least the Afghan Taliban was honest.
It made it abundantly clear that its aim was
to control the lives of its subjects through
fanatical religious morality. In America,
we are not so lucky. We live with the illu
sion that we possess the freedom to do
whatever we want as long as it does not
conflict with the laws of the government.
Anyone who believes that might as well go
live in Afghanistan.
Under the Taliban regime, church and
state were inextricably fused, and all that
was deemed immoral was made illegal.
Under our own government, this control
is much more insidious because it is so sub
tle. Where the law stops, religious morali
ty takes over. If you don't believe that, just
take a look at which the vehemence with
which parents and religious groups fight
(and often succeed) for creationism and
against the Rainbow Curriculum in out
schools. Their authority does not come
from fallible human officials but rather

straight from the top.
The Afghans hated us because we, the
infidels, defiled their holy land. We hate
them because they, the infidels, defiled
ours. An infidel is someone who is lacking
in faith. To them, we lack the belief in the
teachings of their interpretation of God.
Maybe this never would have happened if
someone over there realized that our slav
ery to guilt and morality is no less perva
sive, albeit more abstruse, than theirs.
To us, the Taliban lacks faith in the sys
tem of capitalism, when in reality it is the
opponent of American imperialism
(specifically in defense of its oil supply).
Osama bin Laden is our creation; we
trained him, just as we trained the men
who flew those planes into the Twin Tow
ers. We did this to further our own impe
rialist aims when the Soviet Union was still
a threat to us. The only difference bet ween
Afghan and American terrorist training
camps is that ours are better.
The apparent dissimilarities between
the U.S. government and the Taliban are
superficial at best. The Afghan citizens are

force-fed doctrine, while we are fed lies
gently to believe we are not being force
fed doctrine. Every successful govern
ment exerts a degree of control and ma
nipulation over its citizens. The Taliban
does it directly, while America relies on
CNN, corporate industry and the reli
gious right to do precisely the same thing
for it.
This whole situation puts me in a state
of great conflict, because it would be mad
ness for me to condone a violent action. An
attack on a government should never con
sist of an attack on its innocent citizens.
Yet, at the same time, I cannot entirely
condemn the goal and motives of that at
tack and say it was wholly unjustified. Ei
ther way, I find it grotesquely hypocritical
that a nation that engages in wholesale re
pression and state-sponsored terrorism
would attack another that practices the
very same thing with such righteousness,
whether it was attacked first or not.
