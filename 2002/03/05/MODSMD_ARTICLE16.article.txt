# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Braveheart genes? A winter Olympics redux 
### BEV HUMPHREY GUEST COLUMNIST 
If the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
City are any indicator, I'm convinced that
we humans have foiled natural selection.
Let's take the sport of skeleton, for instance.
Who was the nut case who sat around and
said, "Say, let's revive a sport that calls fora
single goofy guy to hurtle head first down
an ice-covered cement chute on a cafeteria
tray?" What a good idea!
Even more alarming is the fact that
there are guys at this point in human
evolution who are eager to do this, fake
gold medallist Jim Shea, for instance,
who opined publicly that an accident
could break every bone in his body.
Imagine that.
Now, Jim just might be a fitting speci
men for the Human Genome I'roject. In
stead of worrying about stuff like Hunt

ington's Disease, maybe we should be
trying to sequence the "wacky gene."
After all, it certainly seems to be more
übiquitous in the general population. It's
a veritable epidemic, if you ask me, as I
take stock of the proliferation of extreme
sports and their devotees. When, exactly,
did all of our youth turn into Wile E.
Coyote? Forget preaching abstinence,
Mr. Bush: I believe we should consider
launching a vigorous campaign for state
sponsored lree vasectomies.
And let's not forget "Skategate" — all
that international collective whining
about fixing in a so-called sport that fea
tures one of the world's most annoying,
self-promoting commentators in the
form of Scott Hamilton.
How did someone who looks like
Jiminy Cricket and gyrates to the theme'
from "Rocky" get so far in life and earn
such cloying obeisance from his peers?

Indeed, Hamilton continues the hal
lowed tradition of other sports motor
mouths like Dick Vitale, who ruined col
lege basketball, and John Madden, who
might turn out to be a bit vexatious on
Monday Night Football.
To give Madden his due, however, he
once said something to the effect that an
event that requires sequins and music is
not a sport. This is a trenchant insight,
second only to the astute individual who
referred to synchronized swimming as
"formation drowning." As for those
conehead skating judges ("We're from
France"), it simply boggles the mind that
they could be guilty of influence ped
dling when millions of dollars in en
dorsements, appearances, are on the
line. Right. Moving right along ....
And what about that Apollo Ohno
dude, gangbanger turned speed freak in
short-track speed skating? Now, t here's a

sport that almost makes the Highway
280/ 85 interchange look like a reason
able proposition. I thought the remake
of "Rollerball" was a movie, not an event
at the Winter Olympics. Perhaps they
should consider adding motorcycles to
round out the concept.
This could be a generational thing
with me — because I have no doubt
segued into the "old fart" category —
but what's with that patch of fungus on
Ohno's chin? Or is it a resident free
climbing gerbil? (There's a Richard Gere
joke in here somewhere, but I don't
think we'll go there.) Girls, is this what
passes fora chick magnet these days? In
any event, I just don't think I'd like it
staring back at me from box of Wheaties
first thing in the morning.
And finally, let's not neglect curling, a
"sport" brought to you by my people.
(Therefore, I reserve the right to satirize

them; so don't even think about sending
me politically correct hate mail.)
Basically, it is Bocce Ball on ice with
out the good eats and the joie de vivre.
Brought to you by guys who wear skirts
and eat oatmeal boiled in a sheep's stom
ach. I'm convinced that curling is why
no-wax floors were invented.
Ah yes, my Scottish progenitors invent
ed golf and curling, which are arguably
among the most' somniferous activities
known to humankind. This must be why
God made serious intoxicants — and then
rested. As for genetics, I can only hope that
my Braveheart genes are dominant —
and the curling ones are recessive.
