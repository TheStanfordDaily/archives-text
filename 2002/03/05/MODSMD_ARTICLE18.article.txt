ence Championships.

WRESTLING
Saturday-Sunday: Stan
ford finishes seventh at the Pac
-10 Championships in Corval
lis, Ore.

The Cardinal (10-8, 3-4 Pac
-10) finished seventh overall but
senior Levi Weikel-Magden,
sophomore Nathan Peterson
and redshirt freshmen Brad
Metzler and Matt Gentry quali
fied for the NCAA Champi
onships, which will be held
March 21-23 in Albany, N.Y.
"I'm very pleased with how
the weekend turned out," said
head coach Steve Buddie. "If you
had told me going in that we
would've had four guys qualify, I
would've been ecstatic."
Seeds were set Friday afternoon
and the two-day double-elimina
tion tournament began Saturday
morning at Oregon State.
"I told these guys you don't
need to beat everyone," Bucldie

said. "You need to put together
two or three of your best matches
and you'll qualify."
Stanford's four qualifiers did
just t hat .
In the first session, unseeded
Metzler won his bout by injury
default over No. 3 Casey I lorn of
Oregon State.
Wrestling in the Pac-10's
toughest weight class this year,
Metzler proceeded to go 1 -1 on
Sunday to capture fourth place at
141 pounds.
Gentry, the No. 2 seed at
149, extended his winning
streak to 15 with a 4-2 decision
overCal Poly-San Luis Obispo's
Matt Cox in his first bout.
A 3-1 decision over Cal State-
Bakersfield's Thomas Juarez
later in the day placed Gentry in
the finals against No. 1 seed
Collin Robertson.
The match was a shot at re
demption, as Robertson was the
last person to defeat Gentry in the
finals ofthe Aggie Open on Jan. 12.
The Boise State junior pre
vailed again, however, with a pin
at 4:53.
Weikel-Magden upset No. 1
seed Rocky Smart of Arizona
State on Sunday with a 4-1 deci
sion after advancing to the semi
finals by posting an impressive 7-

3 decision over Cal State-Fuller
ton's Leo Sanchez at 157. Smart
had been ranked eighth in the
nation heading into the tourna
ment.
Weikel-Magden's perfor
mance earned him third-place
honors, and his first trip to the
NCAAs, in his last year on the
Farm. The fifth-year senior came
close to qualifying at last year's
tournament, finishing sixth.
Meanwhile, Peterson went 5-1
on his way to a third-place finish
at 125 pounds. The sophomore
advanced to the consolation
semifinals with a 3-1 record on
Saturday and then beat Oregon
State's Michael Delaney for the

second time in the tournament in
the third-place match.
Stanford's last NCAA qualifier
was Zach Zimmerer, who did it
four times from 1997-2000. The
last time the Cardinal had four
qualifiers was 1997.
"Some of our guys didn ; t do as
well as they could have," Buddie
said. "The key now is to get them
wrestling to their potential."
Despite being eliminated in
his third bout by Oregon's Shane
Webster at 174, true freshman
I mad Kharbush recorded a 14-4
major decision on Saturday.
