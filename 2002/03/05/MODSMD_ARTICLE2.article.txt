# Band suspended from Pac-10s
## Alcohol discovered in Band Shak prompts OSA to take action 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Band was placed on
travel suspension last week after alco
hol containers were found in the Band
Shak, said Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves.
"The Band has [been suspended] be
cause they flagrantly violated the alcohol
probation that had been put on them,"
Graves said.
At least one keg and many empty bot
tles of beer were found by custodial staff
inside the Band Shak on Thursday
morning after a party, said Graves. The
alcohol was related to the selection of the
new Tree mascot for the 2002-2003
school year.
"I was also informed that people had
thrown up and not cleaned up [after
themselves]," Graves said.
Senior Mike Huijon, public relations
manager for the Band, said the gather
ing was neither "premeditated nor pub
licized." He also said he wouldn't call it a
"party."
The Band was put on alcohol proba
tion by the Office of Student Activities in
mid-February for undisclosed incidents
involving alcohol consumption* The
probation had not affected the Band's
traveling schedule.
But as a result of the suspension, the
Band was not allowed to travel with the
women's basketball team to the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament at the
University of Oregon. They will also

not be able to play at the upcoming
men's Pac-10 Conference Tourna
ment, which will take place in Los An
geles beginning Thursday.
"We want the Band [there], " said
Assoc. Athletic Director Darrin Nelson.
"But being there is not a right, it's a priv
ilege. They have to earn their way there
just like our teams earn their way there.
They have to behave appropriately."
Huijon said that only a few Band
members were involved in the alcohol
consumption that led to the suspension.
"A small subset of the Band violated
our alcohol probation," Huijon said.
"Our new Tree was selected last week.

During the selection process, a bit of a
mess was made in the Band Shack and
the Athletic Department made an unan
nounced inspection of the fire sprinklers
the next morning.
"It was in between the Tree event and
cleaning up. They saw the mess and were
understandably upset."
University administrators said they
were unsure whether the suspension
would affect the Band's appearance at
the upcoming men's and women's
NCAA basketball tournaments.
"It will depend on whether they will
