# Band suspended from Pac-10s
## Alcohol discovered in Band Shak prompts OSA to take action 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Band was placed on
travel suspension last week after alco
hol containers were found in the Band
Shak, said Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves.
"The Band has [been suspended] be
cause they flagrantly violated the alcohol
probation that had been put on them,"
Graves said.
At least one keg and many empty bot
tles of beer were found by custodial staff
inside the Band Shak on Thursday
morning after a party, said Graves. The
alcohol was related to the selection of the
new Tree mascot for the 2002-2003
school year.
"I was also informed that people had
thrown up and not cleaned up [after
themselves]," Graves said.
Senior Mike Huijon, public relations
manager for the Band, said the gather
ing was neither "premeditated nor pub
licized." He also said he wouldn't call it a
"party."
The Band was put on alcohol proba
tion by the Office of Student Activities in
mid-February for undisclosed incidents
involving alcohol consumption* The
probation had not affected the Band's
traveling schedule.
But as a result of the suspension, the
Band was not allowed to travel with the
women's basketball team to the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament at the
University of Oregon. They will also

not be able to play at the upcoming
men's Pac-10 Conference Tourna
ment, which will take place in Los An
geles beginning Thursday.
"We want the Band [there], " said
Assoc. Athletic Director Darrin Nelson.
"But being there is not a right, it's a priv
ilege. They have to earn their way there
just like our teams earn their way there.
They have to behave appropriately."
Huijon said that only a few Band
members were involved in the alcohol
consumption that led to the suspension.
"A small subset of the Band violated
our alcohol probation," Huijon said.
"Our new Tree was selected last week.

During the selection process, a bit of a
mess was made in the Band Shack and
the Athletic Department made an unan
nounced inspection of the fire sprinklers
the next morning.
"It was in between the Tree event and
cleaning up. They saw the mess and were
understandably upset."
University administrators said they
were unsure whether the suspension
would affect the Band's appearance at
the upcoming men's and women's
NCAA basketball tournaments.
"It will depend on whether they will

deal with this responsibly or if
they'll blow it off and say it's not
their fault," Graves said.
"Being in a leadership position
makes it hard for one to make de
cisions. It appears that a significant
number of leaders in the Band are
not willing to make those deci
sions," he said.
Huijon said the many members
of the Band were disappointed
with the suspension.
"We enjoy trips," he said. "But
more than that, we feel it's unfair.
The two basketball teams are hav
ing really great years and we enjoy
supporting them and we feel
we're an invaluable source of sup
port for them.
"The prevailing feeling is that it
was a quick reaction to an issue
they feel needed to be
addressed — we can't insult them
for that."

Several administrators are
scheduled to meet with Hand
members on Thursday to discuss
the violation.
"We expect them to submit a
written document stating exactly
what the [Band} leadership will do
to resolve this issue, and how they
will better manage their facilities,"
Graves said.
Huijon said he thinks the mat
ter will be resolved.
"We're working with the Athlet
ics Department and the adminis
tration," he said. "We feel confi
dent that the measures we propose
will be accepted and our travel sus
pension will be lilted."
Graves also said that he was op
timistic that the administration
would reach a compromise with
the Band.
"What we have found is that
when the Band has been willing
to work with lis to resolve prob
lems, we always resolve them,"
he said. 'That's what we're hop
ing for."
But Graves added the possibili

ty that the Band could also be sus
pended as a recognized student
group. In that case, the Band
would no longer receive ASSU
funding and would not be able to
use University facilities.
"That's the worst-case sce
nario," Graves said. "That's if the
Band refuses to cooperate."
Nelson said that the Athletics
Department would adhere to the
decision that is made by the Office
of Student Activities.
"Should the Band lose their
funding and the University throws
them off campus, athletics will go
along with that and not let them
perform in any of our events," Nel
son said.
Nelson said he hoped fora fa
vorable outcome.
"We hope they'll be able to
play again," Nelson said. "But
we'll need to talk to [the Office
of Student Activities] and the
Band members to see how they
can correct these things, and to
see if they can play in the NCAA
Tournament."

lems, we always resolve them,"
he said. 'That's what we're hop
ing for."
But Graves added the possibili

ty that the Band could also be sus
pended as a recognized student
group. In that case, the Band
would no longer receive ASSU
funding and would not be able to
use University facilities.
"That's the worst-case sce
nario," Graves said. "That's if the
Band refuses to cooperate."
Nelson said that the Athletics
Department would adhere to the
decision that is made by the Office
of Student Activities.
"Should the Band lose their
funding and the University throws
them off campus, athletics will go
along with that and not let them
perform in any of our events," Nel
son said.
Nelson said he hoped fora fa
vorable outcome.
"We hope they'll be able to
play again," Nelson said. "But
we'll need to talk to [the Office
of Student Activities] and the
Band members to see how they
can correct these things, and to
see if they can play in the NCAA
Tournament."
The Stanford Band was placed on
travel suspension last week after alco
hol containers were found in the Band
Shak, said Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves.
"The Band has [been suspended] be
cause they flagrantly violated the alcohol
probation that had been put on them,"
Graves said.
At least one keg and many empty bot
tles of beer were found by custodial staff
inside the Band Shak on Thursday
morning after a party, said Graves. The
alcohol was related to the selection of the
new Tree mascot for the 2002-2003
school year.
"I was also informed that people had
thrown up and not cleaned up [after
themselves]," Graves said.
Senior Mike Huijon, public relations
manager for the Band, said the gather
ing was neither "premeditated nor pub
licized." He also said he wouldn't call it a
"party."
The Band was put on alcohol proba
tion by the Office of Student Activities in
mid-February for undisclosed incidents
involving alcohol consumption* The
probation had not affected the Band's
traveling schedule.
But as a result of the suspension, the
Band was not allowed to travel with the
women's basketball team to the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament at the
University of Oregon. They will also

not be able to play at the upcoming
men's Pac-10 Conference Tourna
ment, which will take place in Los An
geles beginning Thursday.
"We want the Band [there], " said
Assoc. Athletic Director Darrin Nelson.
"But being there is not a right, it's a priv
ilege. They have to earn their way there
just like our teams earn their way there.
They have to behave appropriately."
Huijon said that only a few Band
members were involved in the alcohol
consumption that led to the suspension.
"A small subset of the Band violated
our alcohol probation," Huijon said.
"Our new Tree was selected last week.

During the selection process, a bit of a
mess was made in the Band Shack and
the Athletic Department made an unan
nounced inspection of the fire sprinklers
the next morning.
"It was in between the Tree event and
cleaning up. They saw the mess and were
understandably upset."
University administrators said they
were unsure whether the suspension
would affect the Band's appearance at
the upcoming men's and women's
NCAA basketball tournaments.
"It will depend on whether they will

deal with this responsibly or if
they'll blow it off and say it's not
their fault," Graves said.
"Being in a leadership position
makes it hard for one to make de
cisions. It appears that a significant
number of leaders in the Band are
not willing to make those deci
sions," he said.
Huijon said the many members
of the Band were disappointed
with the suspension.
"We enjoy trips," he said. "But
more than that, we feel it's unfair.
The two basketball teams are hav
ing really great years and we enjoy
supporting them and we feel
we're an invaluable source of sup
port for them.
"The prevailing feeling is that it
was a quick reaction to an issue
they feel needed to be
addressed — we can't insult them
for that."

Several administrators are
scheduled to meet with Hand
members on Thursday to discuss
the violation.
"We expect them to submit a
written document stating exactly
what the [Band} leadership will do
to resolve this issue, and how they
will better manage their facilities,"
Graves said.
Huijon said he thinks the mat
ter will be resolved.
"We're working with the Athlet
ics Department and the adminis
tration," he said. "We feel confi
dent that the measures we propose
will be accepted and our travel sus
pension will be lilted."
Graves also said that he was op
timistic that the administration
would reach a compromise with
the Band.
