Stanford's lacrosse team exhib
ited its most intense play of the sea
son Saturday when it faced Cor
nell at Stanford Stadium. Howev
er, the short spurts of intensity
were not enough to withstand the
fiery Big Red, which pounded the
Cardinal, 20-6.

Today: Stanford vs. St. Mary's,
7:00 p.m., Stanford Stadium

Stanford lacked the ability to
carry a high level of aggressiveness
more than a few minutes at a time
and was therefore no match fora
team whose second and third efforts
dominated much of the game.
"Our intensity wavered a lot,"
said Stanford sophomore attack
er Tiffany Chao. "But we did
show ourselves the intensity we're
capable of."
As the game started, Stanford
came out of the gate with fire as se
nior tri-captain and midfielder
Emily Rodriguez gained control
of the draw and ran the ball down
the field.
Freshman defender Nina Pan
tano tallied the first goal of the
game at 2:30, but that was soon
answered by four Cornell goals as
the Big Red began to dominate
the game.
Cornell's passion was evident: It
controlled the majority of the draws
and many of its goals came from fast
breaks clown the field. The Cardinal
scored another three goals before
the half, but Cornell continued to
play strong, leaving the halftime
score at 11 -4.
"Defensively, we wanted to stay
goal side of Cornell, pressure them

out of the circle and force bad pass
es and shots," said sophomore
midfielder Abbi Hills.
Stanford's defense came up with
several important interceptions, but
then faltered in transitioning the
ball up the field as Cornell repeat
edly closed in on the Cardinal.
The game marked the first colle
giate appearance for sophomore
goalkeeper Christina Saikus, who
came in to tally four saves after start
ing goalkeeper Virginia Solomon
left with six.
Sophomore midfielder Kelsey
Twist, who tallied one goal and one
assist, stated that ah aim of the
Stanford team going into the
match was to focus on itself rather
than its opponent.
"We wanted to keep communi
cation consistent throughout the
game," Twist said. "This game gave
ns a chance to practice regrouping.
Playing Cornell will give us, a young
team, the opportunity to mature."
Stanford should perhaps be
most proud of its play in final two
minutes of the game. After calling a
time out with only two minutes left,
the Cardinal decided it would not
give up and instead played to the
high level of energy it knew it was
capable of.
Freshman attacker Claire Cal
zonetti scored the final Stanford
goal off a free position at 58:10 to
bring the final score to 20-6.
"It would be nice to play 60 full
minutes like the last two minutes,"
Carney said. "If we play Tuesday
the way we played in the last two
minutes, we should be fine."
Tuesday marks game two
against West Coast rival St.
Mary's, a team Stanford has al
ready beaten, 12-8. It will take on
the Caels at 7 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium, where the Cardinal has
been playing its home games be
cause of unsatisfactory conditions
on New Maloney Field.
