# Bullfighting a cool sport to watch
## 
### 
For anyone who lias never
had the privilege of attend
ing a bull light, you are
truly missing one of sports'
greatest institutions.
Bullfighting is packed with all
the things we (OK, maybe just
guys) love about sports: Non-stop
action, thrilling finishes, huge
stakes in the performances, blood,
death and big shiny swords.
Bullfights have countless facets
that you just can't find in any
other sport on the planet. In what
other sport are you allowed, re
quired even, to kill your oppo
nent if he decides that your taunt
ing is inappropriate? Well, maybe
inner-city basketball.
But bullfighters hang their
heads high and proudly strut
about the fatally wounded carcass
of their victim, as opposed to
shouting, "Who's the man now,
b* ~ #h!" and running before the
man starts bustin' caps.
There is no other sport in which
the competitors are so tilled with
pride and reverence for their craft.
Each matador proudly swaggers
into the middle of the ring, a look of

conquest and self
assurance upon
his face, and radi
ates an aura of
ruggedness and
courage that capti
vates his audience.
Not even the
fact that he's
dressed like a live-

dollar man-whore in pants tight
enough to be featured in a Shakira
video can take away from the robust
image of this modern-day gladiator.
Each movement of the matador,
so well-timed and precise, is poetry
in motion. Like a scene from a
Shakespearean battle, the champi
on ebbs and flows, tilts and sways,
in perfect rhythm with intended
purpose. And as each movement
leaves his opponent weaker and
more enraged, the artist raises his
sword, challenges the beast and in
spires a hate-filled final charge.
Standing stalwart as rock in the lace
of an oncoming torrent, the matador
meets his adversary and plunges his
steel sword deep into the bull through
the vertebrae and into the heart.
When the dust settles, the blood

oozes out into pools on the battle
field, and as the mortally wounded
beast stumbles around in unimag
inable agony, praying for death to
relieve its pain, you finally realize
how cool this sport is.
Sure, is kind of cool
when there are wrecks and stulf,
but you never get to see actual
puddles of blood. And the bull
fighters don't even stop there.
They have a guy come out with
some sort of small ice-pick type in
strument and repeatedly jab the
brains of the dying bull until the
bull stops kicking or until the stab
ber works out all of his pent-up
hostility. When was the last time
you saw an ice-pick man in the
N FL? Ray Lewis doesn't count.
And possibly the best part about
bullfighting is the fact that if the
matador decides he wants to do his
best Randy Moss impression and
only play when he feels like it, the
bull gets to kill him. It completely
eliminates the need for annoying
signs or expletive-laden chants to
ward the offending player. In
stead, you get to watch him die a
slow painful death from a deep

gorge in his flesh. Talk about get
ting more bang for your buck. If
only the Golden State Warriors
were subject to the same late.
I will admit that bulls are cruel
ly abused and tortured until they
suffer an excruciatingly painful
death in the name of sport. But so
are Cubs fans, and Wrigley Field
continues to sell out on a regular
basis. Besides, I don't see any ani
mal rights activists volunteering to
take the bulls' places.
So as the dead carcass of the bull
is ceremoniously dragged off be
hind a team of horses, and the
blood stains are cleaned away, we
are privileged once again to get to
experience one of sports' greatest
marvels.
And no matter what type of emo
tions the spoil spin's inside of you, you
are left contemplating one burning
question: When are they going to start
doing this to the New York Yankees?

Ryan Stewart, a junior majoring in
economics, wants to be a bullfighter
