# Society to give out instructor prize
## 
### ELLIE RITCH STAFF WRITER 
Academic success stories often result
from an inspiring teacher who consistent
ly elicits student achievement. The Stan
ford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa honors
one such teacher every year with the Phi
Beta Kappa Teaching Prize.
The prize is designed to celebrate a
professor or instructor who has helped
Stanford students thrive intellectually.
Winners of the award receive an engraved
plaque and a cash prize of $1,500.
Susie Brubaker-Cole, the director of
undergraduate research programs and
the chapter secretary, said a committee
of eight Phi Beta Kappa students from
this year's senior class will decide the
winner. The winner will be announced
and presented with the award during
the annual Phi Beta Kappa spring initi
ation ceremony in June.

"Each year [the society's] seniors re
evaluate the selection criteria to assure that
they fit with their particular conception of
excellence in teaching," Brubaker-Cole
said. "Thus the prize is truly a reflection of
the senior class that awards it."
Last year's prize went to Religious
Studies Prof. Robert Gregg. John
Hanna, a senior at the time, spoke for the
honor society and presented Gregg with
the 2001 award.
"A student member who knows the
teacher presents the.award by reading a
brief citation compiled from the nomina
tions," Brubaker-Cole said.
Following tradition, the recipient's
name is kept secret until the student pre
senter announces the winner on stage at
the ceremony.
"It's a very moving moment when the
student makes the announcement in 112 ront
of the full initiation audience," said
Brubaker-Cole.

Last June, Gregg planned to attend the
initiation to support his students, and was
surprised when the prize was presented to
him.
"I've gone to the ceremony several
times to support students being inducted,
and to meet their families," Gregg said.
"But when the description of the person to
be honored unfolded, the field of possible
people narrowed."
Gregg said diat Stanford students are
peifect for his personal teaching style.
"One of my teaching goals is to break
from our chronological and geographical
provincialisms — to see tilings from an
gles unfamiliar to us," Gregg said.
According to Gregg, students are ex
cited to face these challenges.
"Stanford students seem to be more
openly curious, more willing to say what
they don't know but would like to, and
more aggressive and venturesome
in pursuit of new understanding,"
Gregg said. "Who would not like to
spend his or her teaching career
with students who are 'wired' in this
way?"
Students elected to the Stanford
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa have
demonstrated outstanding success
in the classroom. To receive Phi
Beta Kappa, students must achieve
high grades within their major, as
well as across a breadth of fields.

Close to one-tenth of each year's
senior class is elected to Phi Beta
Kappa. A small percentage of this
group is chosen during junior year
and the rest during senior year.
The Stanford chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa is now soliciting nomi
nations from the senior class for
this year's prize. Nominations of
Stanford lecturers, instructors, as
sistant professors and professors
are welcome.
To nominate, graduating se
niors should write a letter explain
ing why ilit' instructor deserves the
award. I -etters can be sent by e-mail
to susiebc(M Stanford.edu. The
deadline is March 15.
