# CDC offers first online career panel
## Writing professionals share experiences through electronic forum 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
'Hie Career Development Center took
a different approach to career panels last
week — it offered one online.
Five panelists for the Writing Career
Panel posted online profiles about their
backgrounds. Students and community
members could then ask the panelists
questions using Panfora, a virtual bulletin
board.
The panelists — journalists and tech
nical writers — would check in once a day
for four clays and respond to the posts.
"From the organizational point of
view, finding panelists who could arrange
time to come to Stanford fora traditional
panel is always problematic," said Lance

Choy, director of the CDC. "A virtual
panel means I don't have to worry about
the panelists' schedule, how far they are
from Stanford, when they can be available
[and] parking problems. I have a lot more
flexibility finding panelists."
The virtual panel also allowed for
more people at Stanford to participate
and look at the questions posed, even
after the discussion closed.
"[Live] panels may attract five to 20 stu
dents on average," Choy said. "Creating a
virtual panel allowed students to obtain
valuable information over a few days."
Choy added that 2H4 people visited the
site where the profiles are located and 20
students registered to participate in the
discussion group. But only five posed
questions.
"I was disappointed that students did
not make use of the bulletin board discus
sion group," Choy said. "Perhaps the pro
files were sufficient and students had no
other questions."
While the forum was directed at stu

dents, it was open to anyone who wanted
to participate — even Palo Alto commu
nity members and alumni.
The goal of the forum, according to
Choy, was to show students different ca
reers and to give tips on how to break into
various professions.
"With three to four panelists sched
uled you always have the problem of not
having enough time for each panelist to
share their stories," Choy said. "A virtual
format made the time issues irrelevant."
The profiles gave insights into careers
of the five panelists. They discussed how
they started in the business, what a typical
day looks like and what their job entails.
To create the panel, Choy used per
sonal contacts and lists of alumni who are
interested in providing information to
students.
"I tried to find individuals represent
ing a wide range of fields," Choy said.
