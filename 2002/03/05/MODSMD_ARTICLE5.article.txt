The contest was a hard-fought battle be
tween two determined teams.
Sophomore forward Nicole Powell
picked up where she left off the previous
night, she scored a career-best 37 points,
by driving hard to the bucket to open up
the scoring.
Arizona State responded immediately,
nailing a 3-pointer and outscoring the
Cardinal, 12-0, in the opening minutes of
the game.
Powell quickly became the focal point of
the Sun Devils' swarming defense and was
held to4-of-l7 shooting on the night.
Therefore, the Cardinal needed a floor
leader and found one in senior forward
Enjoli I/idor.

Izidor, helping Powell at the point, used
her size to her advantage, driving inside the
paint and converting on a three-point play.
Then she did it again a few plays later.
Izidor's aggressive offense sparked a 12-
0 Stanford run to give the team its largest
lead of the half at 19-12.
Izidor's heroic efforts kept the Cardinal
in the game and earned her a spot on the
All-Tournament team. Her 22 points, a
team high and a career high, couldn't have
come in a bigger game.
"They doubled up on Nicole and 1
thought Enjoli did a great job running the
offense," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
The Sun Devils remained determined
and responded to the Cardinal's run with
one of its own, passing Stanford at 23-21
thanks to a big three by Betsy Boardman.
While Powell struggled to find her shot
from the floor, her free throws were solid.
She converted on eight of her nine at
tempts in the half. The final three came in
the last 0.2 seconds after she was fouled be
hind the arc.
Stanford returned from the locker room
and looked well on its way to victory as it
pushed the lead to 40-31.
Sun Devils senior guard Amanda Lev
ens pulled her team through though. After
a sluggish offensive first half in which she
scored only five points, I'evens poured on
the heat to end with a game-high 20 points.
Levens spearheaded her team's 11-2
