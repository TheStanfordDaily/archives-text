ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
(AP) â€” The widow of Daniel
Pearl, an American reporter slain
by Islamic militants, met Thurs
day with Pakistani President Per
vez Musharraf, who expressed his
"heartfelt grief' for Pearl's death.
The meeting with Mariane
Pearl took place in Islamabad, the
capital, Pakistan state television
said, broadcasting brief footage
from the meeting.
Musharraf expressed condo
lences and "heartfelt grief' over
the killing of The Wall Street
Journal's South Asia correspon
dent, describing it as a "most bar
baric" act of terrorism, the televi
sion station reported.
It said Mariane Pearl thanked
Musharraf for the government's
efforts to apprehend his killers.
Meanwhile, the wife of a top
suspect in the slaying of Pearl
asked a Pakistani court to inter
vene to stop her husband from
being sent to the United States to
stand trial.
The Pakistani government
hasn't said definitively that it
would turn Ahmed Omar Saeed
Sheikh over, but it is under pres
sure from the United States to
transfer him.

Sadia Saeed Sheikh, wife of
British-born Saeed, filed the peti
tion Friday in a Karachi court
seeking to keep her husband in
Pakistan, prosecutor Raja
Quereshi said.
She said Saeed, 28, had noth
ing to do with Pearl's Jan. 23 kid
napping and he hadn't been in
Karachi at the time Pearl disap
peared, according to the prosecu
tor. She said Saeed had been in
the eastern city of Lahore from
Jan. 23 to Feb. 5.
The motion asks that the gov
ernment explain its position on
Saeed's case. The Sindh High
Court is scheduled to take it up
today.
Pearl was kidnapped in
Karachi while researching links
between Pakistani extremists and
Richard C. Reicl, who was arrest
ed in December on a Paris-Miami
flight he allegedly boarded with
explosives in his sneakers.
Saeed confessed in a court
hearing Feb. 14 to involvement in
the kidnapping but later with
drew the confession, which was
not made under oath.
A week later, a videotape re
ceived by U.S. diplomats in
Karachi revealed Pearl's murder,

showing the 38-year-old journal
ist being forced to say he was Jew
ish, followed by images of his
body being decapitated.
The United States hasn't in
dicted Saeed in the Pearl case, but
U.S. authorities are seeking his
handover under a 1994 warrant
for the kidnapping of another
American.
In Washington, U.S. officials
have announced a $5 million re
ward for information about
Pearl's kidnapping and murder.
State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said Wednes
day that the reward would be of
fered across Pakistan.
The offer is for information
leading to the arrest or convic
tion, in any country, of people re
sponsible for Pearl's murder,
Boucher said.
Pakistani officials have said
they're searching for at least four
more key suspects in the Jan. 23
abduction now that Saeed is in
c ustody. The main target of a po
lice manhunt is now Amjad
Faruqi, who Pakistani police be
lieve carried out Pearl's kidnap
ping.
Altogether, there are more
than a dozen suspects.
