If you're looking for the best
way to cruise around campus this
spring, the all-electric Nova Cruz
Voloci may be the answer. The
Voloci has a range of 50 miles with
a battery-pack extension,and a
top speed of 30 mph. Its swing
arm suspension can handle any
thing from potholes to steep hills.
The nickel-metal-hydride batter
ies take only three hours to fully
charge. Prices start at $2,495.
Applied Digital Solutions, a
Florida-based technology com
pany, is preparing to seek gov
ernment approval for the
VeriChip, a computer ID chip
that would be implanted inside
the body and could be used to
store everything from secret
codes to sensitive medical in

formation. The company is
also developing another im
plant device that would work
in conjunction with the
VeriChip to allow satellite
tracking of an individual's
every movement. The compa
ny announced that it will soon
begin the process of getting
the Food and Drug Adminis
tration's approval for the chip.
The company and intends to
limit its marketing to compa
nies that ensure that its use for
humans is voluntary.
The driverless ULTrapod, a
brainchild of Advanced Trans
port Systems, may be the taxi of
the future. The battery-powered
pods will operate on a single live
loot track — less than half the
width of a single road lane —
and recharge at every stop to
keep energy levels topped up.

Designers envi-

sion passengers "hailing" the pod
from a designated stop, where
they select their destination along
a set route. When the pod pulls
up, the passengers swipe a smart
card giving the travel details and
the ULTrapod carries them di
rectly to their chosen stop. The
company hopes to have 30 pods
circling the Cardiff Bay area in
Wales by 2004.
Last week, a computer game
titled Halo: Combat Evolved,
won home game of the year and
console game of the year honors
at the 2002 Interactive Achieve
ment Awards. The game deploys
a cyber-enhanced soldier whose
mission is to keep a threatening
alien race away from planet
Earth. Halo is one of the flagship
carriers for Microsoft's Xbox
gaming platform.
