# Cameras catch speeders
## 
### 
HONOLULU (AP) —Some
I lawaii drivers mockingly call them
the "talivans," and radio disc jock
eys take wicked delight in announc
ing the location of the vehicles.
The Hawaii Transportation
Department has begun using
van-mounted cameras to catch
speeders in the act — a practice
some motorists consider so un
derhanded they are trying to sub
vert the system.
The cameras, introduced on
Oahu two months ago and operat
ed by a private company, are cou
pled with radar and automatically
photograph a speeder's license
plate. A ticket is then issued by mail
to the car's owner.
The devices are supposed to
catch violators the way red-light
cameras have been doing for years,
without the danger of a police
chase.
Proponents say that the system
will save lives and that it has al
ready proved itself by slowing
clown traffic.

Drivers and civil liberties lawyers
complain that the system unfairly
assumes that the owner of the car
was the person behind the wheel.
They also say that the cameras are
an invasion of privacy and that the
state is more interested in speed
ing-ticket revenue than safety.
Lven lawmakers who support
ed the project are having second
thoughts. The Senate this week is
expected to vote to repeal the
program. House lawmakers on
Friday voted to requite clearer
photographic evidence of who
was driving.
Republican state Rep. Charles
Djou called the program "an un
reasonable intrusion by govern
ment into individual lives."
"Many of my constituents have
complained to me that this photo
enforcement system is sort of a
'gotcha' law enforcement," he said.
"It is a high-tech bounty hunter
system that captures not only the
lawbreakers but also law-abiding
citizens."
