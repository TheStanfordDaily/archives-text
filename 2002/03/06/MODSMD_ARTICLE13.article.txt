# Microsoft, critics to battle over sanctions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Justice Department
and Microsoft will make their case to a federal judge
today that their landmark antitrust settlement is good
for the economy and consumers.
Their voices won't be the only ones heard — the
judge has set aside almost an hour for Microsoft's
critics.
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly will hear
from all the parties —Justice, Microsoft, the nine set
tling states and several groups that are against the deal
— in a hearing that will ultimately determine whether
the judge approves or tosses out the settlement.
Her decision may come much later. Nine other
states seeking stronger penalties against Microsoft are
scheduled to begin their own proceeding next week,
although the company is trying to delay that hearing.
Thejudge is widely expected to postpone her de
cision until that trial ends — which could take sever
al months.
fhe settlement would prevent Microsoft from re
taliating against partners for using non-Microsoft
products; require the company to disclose some of its
software blueprints so software developers can make
compatible products; and make it easier for con
sumers to remove extra Windows features.

Jim Ellis, general counsel for Bell telephone, said
Microsoft's track record combined with technology
convergence makes it important that all tech firms
speak out about the settlement.
"What I don't understand is why every software
writer, every entertainment entity, every cable com
pany, every communications provider are not in this
case," Ellis said.
At least two groups say they plan to tell thejudge
that a provision that would allow computer manufac
turers to remove icons leading to "middleware" prod
ucts, like the Internet Explorer Web browser or Mi
crosoft's instant messaging program, are not enough
to help other software developers compete.
The underlying programs would st ill exist in Win
dows, and critics say developers would feel forced to
either write software that's compatible with those Mi
crosoft programs or bear the cost of including com
peting middleware made by companies such as AOL
or Real Networks.
Separately, Microsoft yesterday asked the court to
postpone next week's hearing in which nine states will
ask for harsher penalties against the company. On
Monday, those states extensively revised the penalties
they plan to seek.
