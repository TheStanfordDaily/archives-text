## The 						Stanford Daily Adding Row beds is only a temporary solution 
### 
Stanford undergraduates are experi
encing a housing crunch that will
soon be further exacerbated by
next year's renovation of Branner
Hall. By opening up Sharon Green and
Oak Creek Apartments to undergraduates
and converting study rooms into bed
rooms, the University has temporarily im
proved the situation. However, Student
Housing Services and Residential Educa
tion are now considering increasing occu
pancy on the Row as a whole, by adding a
"few spaces from house to house," accord
ing to John Judicki, associate director of
Res Ed. We hope that this strategy of in
creasing occupancy in already-existing
spaces does not morph from a temporary
fix to a permanent solution.
The remodeling of Mirrielees has yield
ed 150 more beds for undergraduates at
the cost of drastically reducing the amount
of space per person in a popular upper
class dorm. Performing similar changes to
the Row could greatly reduce the quality of
upperclass housing at Stanford. We realize
the only permanent solution to this situa
tion is to build more undergraduate hous
ing, and we hope the University expedites
that process.
The attraction of four years of guaran
teed undergraduate housing, coupled with
the variety of housing options, has long
been a factor in drawing students to Stan
ford and making the University affordable.
With outrageous area housing prices, four
years of guaranteed housing allows many
students to attend Stanford who would oth
erwise have faced financial hardship in hav
ing to secure housing in the area. Prospec
tive students have been impressed with
Stanford's living spaces, but a Pro Fro stay
ing with four students in an old Kimball
study room might opt for more spacious
pastures at one of our peer institutions.
If beds added to Row houses are not re
moved after the Branner renovation, it
could mark the beginning of a reduction in
the quality of undergraduate life. Immedi
ate concerns in increasing the Row's popu
lation would be the lack of adequate
kitchen, bathroom, common area and
parking facilities to accommodate the
extra occupants.
Many variables contribute to the housing
shortage. For example, the number of stu
dents that return from studying abroad or
stopping out in the winter far outweighs
the number leaving for Spring Quarter.
Also, the trend of consecutively higher
yield rates than projected by the Office of
Undergraduate Admission require space
for new students to effectively materialize
from nowhere.
Student Housing Services planned the
conversion of Mirrielees to coincide with
Branner's remodeling and minimize bed
losses. Perhaps it should have planned to
open a new dorm during the year of Bran
ner's shutdown as well.
The University is working to ensure that
all undergraduates are housed, but we
hope that any beds added to the Row are
removed once Branner reopens. The fu
ture completion of new dorms, combined
with careful projection of the number of
new students by the Admission Office will
hopefully solve this housing problem and
remove the need to shuffle students into
makeshift housing or off-campus apart
ment complexes.

RUNNING ON EMPTY
American hosers should
learn about Canada, eh
We live in a troubled world. Vio
lence in the Middle East, unrest
in India and the specter of in
ternational terrorism demand the con
stant vigilance of our best and brightest
minds, leaving the rest of us with little to
do. So in the spirit of investigative jour
nalism and the promotion of internation
al understanding, "Running on Empty"
shines the light on an enigma much clos
er to home, with t he conviction that igno
rance is our greatest vulnerability.
This week's issue: Canada.
I am fascinated by Canada. At 3.8
million square miles, Canada is the sec-
ond-largest country in
the world. I would love
to hike in its Rockies.
I'd like to experience
the sights and sounds of
Montreal. But most of
all, I want to know how
a nation that occupies a
sizeable percentage of
the planet's surface area
has managed to attract
less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
This low profile is intriguing and,
frankly, a little suspicious. Don't you
think it's strange that although the
United States and Canada share the
longest unguarded border in the
world, only Alan Thicke and Alex Tre
bek have bothered to cross to our side?
(This is a slight exaggeration. Several
have also snuck across under the guise
of the National Hockey League).
Don't you find it odd that although
the vast majority of the Canadian popu
lation lives along the U.S. border, North
Dakota has never once had to call and
ask them to turn their music down?
What are they doing up there? Doesn't it
creep you out? Don't you want to know?
You probably don't, because the only
thing more disconcerting than Canada it
self is the fact that most Americans are
only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely
sure what the letters "U.S.A." stand for.
The spec tacle of American ignorance
is immensely entertaining to Canadians,
as demonstrated in"This Hour Has 22
Minutes," a Canadian sketch-comedy
show that highlights the unparalleled
willingness of our people to speak at
great lengths on topics they know abso
lutely nothing about. In a skit entitled
"Talking to Americans," host Rick Mer
cer, in the guise of a reporter, interviews
people on the streets of American cities
for their opinion on Canadian "issues"
such as the legalization of insulin and
the melting of the national igloo.
He also invites people to offer a greet
ing to the Canadian people based on his
questions, eliciting responses like "Con
gratulations, Canada, on making beaver
balls your national dish" (from a ran
dom passerby in Chicago) and "I'm glad
to have the support of Prime Minister
Jean Pontine" (from Texas governor
and then-candidate George W. Bush).
This, as you can imagine, causes Cana
dian viewers to clutch their moose and
howl with laughter.
So what are the hot-button issues
that keep our diplomatic corps working
around the clock? To find out, I
checked with the U.S. Embassy in Ot
tawa (also known as the U.S. Foreign
Service Official Retirement Home). The
"Recent Headlines" section on the Em
bassy's Web page included such press
stopping crises as "Canadian Tomatoes
Dumped on U.S. Markets," "Lumber
Imports: Issues and Events" and "U.S.
to Pursue Action Against Monopolistic
Canadian Wheat Board." It is time
someone had the courage to take on
Canadian wheat. Our children must not
grow up in the threatening shadow of a
stockpile of dietary fiber.
What hurts is that I have the suspi
cion that Canada is holding back on
purpose. When I was overseas, you
could tell the Canadian tourists by the
maple-leaf flag stitched squarely on the
center of their backpack, a tasteful and
subtle way of proclaiming "NOT an ugly
American." There have been painful
misunderstandings in the past. We gave
them boy bands and chain stores. They
gave us Alan is Morrisette and a sorry,
rubbery excuse for bacon. But these
foolish games are tearing us apart.
I would like to take this opportunity
to extend the olive branch to our frosty,
maple-scented friends to the north.
While the Bush administration tackles
the Axis of Evil, we here at Stanford can
do our part for world peace by con
fronting the "Axis of' Eh?'."
Learn something about Canada.
Look at a map. Do something to de
crease your glaring ignorance, because
this past month has shown us the terri
ble, strong arm of Canadian politics.
And that is just over figure skating. God
only knows what else they are capable of.
And Canada, let us try, in our bum
bling American way, to be your friend.
Call us for pick-up games of hockey. In
vite us over for beaver balls. We will
learn from each other, and united we
will ensure that the tragedy of the Expos
will never happen again.

Letters to the Editor
Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi
dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit
ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary

the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit
ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary

Stanford undergraduates are experi
encing a housing crunch that will
soon be further exacerbated by
next year's renovation of Branner
Hall. By opening up Sharon Green and
Oak Creek Apartments to undergraduates
and converting study rooms into bed
rooms, the University has temporarily im
proved the situation. However, Student
Housing Services and Residential Educa
tion are now considering increasing occu
pancy on the Row as a whole, by adding a
"few spaces from house to house," accord
ing to John Judicki, associate director of
Res Ed. We hope that this strategy of in
creasing occupancy in already-existing
spaces does not morph from a temporary
fix to a permanent solution.
The remodeling of Mirrielees has yield
ed 150 more beds for undergraduates at

the cost of drastically reducing the amount
of space per person in a popular upper
class dorm. Performing similar changes to
the Row could greatly reduce the quality of
upperclass housing at Stanford. We realize
the only permanent solution to this situa
tion is to build more undergraduate hous
ing, and we hope the University expedites
that process.
The attraction of four years of guaran
teed undergraduate housing, coupled with
the variety of housing options, has long
been a factor in drawing students to Stan
ford and making the University affordable.
With outrageous area housing prices, four
years of guaranteed housing allows many
students to attend Stanford who would oth
erwise have faced financial hardship in hav
ing to secure housing in the area. Prospec
tive students have been impressed with

Stanford's living spaces, but a Pro Fro stay
ing with four students in an old Kimball
study room might opt for more spacious
pastures at one of our peer institutions.
If beds added to Row houses are not re
moved after the Branner renovation, it
could mark the beginning of a reduction in
the quality of undergraduate life. Immedi
ate concerns in increasing the Row's popu
lation would be the lack of adequate
kitchen, bathroom, common area and
parking facilities to accommodate the
extra occupants.
Many variables contribute to the housing
shortage. For example, the number of stu
dents that return from studying abroad or
stopping out in the winter far outweighs
the number leaving for Spring Quarter.
Also, the trend of consecutively higher
yield rates than projected by the Office of

Undergraduate Admission require space
for new students to effectively materialize
from nowhere.
Student Housing Services planned the
conversion of Mirrielees to coincide with
Branner's remodeling and minimize bed
losses. Perhaps it should have planned to
open a new dorm during the year of Bran
ner's shutdown as well.
The University is working to ensure that
all undergraduates are housed, but we
hope that any beds added to the Row are
removed once Branner reopens. The fu
ture completion of new dorms, combined
with careful projection of the number of
new students by the Admission Office will
hopefully solve this housing problem and
remove the need to shuffle students into
makeshift housing or off-campus apart
ment complexes.

RUNNING ON EMPTY
American hosers should
learn about Canada, eh
We live in a troubled world. Vio
lence in the Middle East, unrest
in India and the specter of in
ternational terrorism demand the con
stant vigilance of our best and brightest
minds, leaving the rest of us with little to
do. So in the spirit of investigative jour
nalism and the promotion of internation
al understanding, "Running on Empty"
shines the light on an enigma much clos
er to home, with t he conviction that igno
rance is our greatest vulnerability.
This week's issue: Canada.
I am fascinated by Canada. At 3.8
million square miles, Canada is the sec-
ond-largest country in
the world. I would love
to hike in its Rockies.
I'd like to experience
the sights and sounds of
Montreal. But most of
all, I want to know how
a nation that occupies a
sizeable percentage of
the planet's surface area
has managed to attract
less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
This low profile is intriguing and,
frankly, a little suspicious. Don't you
think it's strange that although the
United States and Canada share the
longest unguarded border in the
world, only Alan Thicke and Alex Tre
bek have bothered to cross to our side?
(This is a slight exaggeration. Several
have also snuck across under the guise
of the National Hockey League).
Don't you find it odd that although
the vast majority of the Canadian popu
lation lives along the U.S. border, North
Dakota has never once had to call and
ask them to turn their music down?
What are they doing up there? Doesn't it
creep you out? Don't you want to know?
You probably don't, because the only
thing more disconcerting than Canada it
self is the fact that most Americans are
only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely
sure what the letters "U.S.A." stand for.
The spec tacle of American ignorance
is immensely entertaining to Canadians,
as demonstrated in"This Hour Has 22
Minutes," a Canadian sketch-comedy
show that highlights the unparalleled
willingness of our people to speak at
great lengths on topics they know abso
lutely nothing about. In a skit entitled
"Talking to Americans," host Rick Mer
cer, in the guise of a reporter, interviews
people on the streets of American cities
for their opinion on Canadian "issues"
such as the legalization of insulin and
the melting of the national igloo.
He also invites people to offer a greet
ing to the Canadian people based on his
questions, eliciting responses like "Con
gratulations, Canada, on making beaver
balls your national dish" (from a ran
dom passerby in Chicago) and "I'm glad
to have the support of Prime Minister
Jean Pontine" (from Texas governor
and then-candidate George W. Bush).
This, as you can imagine, causes Cana
dian viewers to clutch their moose and
howl with laughter.
So what are the hot-button issues
that keep our diplomatic corps working
around the clock? To find out, I
checked with the U.S. Embassy in Ot
tawa (also known as the U.S. Foreign
Service Official Retirement Home). The
"Recent Headlines" section on the Em
bassy's Web page included such press
stopping crises as "Canadian Tomatoes
Dumped on U.S. Markets," "Lumber
Imports: Issues and Events" and "U.S.
to Pursue Action Against Monopolistic
Canadian Wheat Board." It is time
someone had the courage to take on
Canadian wheat. Our children must not
grow up in the threatening shadow of a
stockpile of dietary fiber.
What hurts is that I have the suspi
cion that Canada is holding back on
purpose. When I was overseas, you
could tell the Canadian tourists by the
maple-leaf flag stitched squarely on the
center of their backpack, a tasteful and
subtle way of proclaiming "NOT an ugly
American." There have been painful
misunderstandings in the past. We gave
them boy bands and chain stores. They
gave us Alan is Morrisette and a sorry,
rubbery excuse for bacon. But these
foolish games are tearing us apart.
I would like to take this opportunity
to extend the olive branch to our frosty,
maple-scented friends to the north.
While the Bush administration tackles
the Axis of Evil, we here at Stanford can
do our part for world peace by con
fronting the "Axis of' Eh?'."
Learn something about Canada.
Look at a map. Do something to de
crease your glaring ignorance, because
this past month has shown us the terri
ble, strong arm of Canadian politics.
And that is just over figure skating. God
only knows what else they are capable of.
And Canada, let us try, in our bum
bling American way, to be your friend.
Call us for pick-up games of hockey. In
vite us over for beaver balls. We will
learn from each other, and united we
will ensure that the tragedy of the Expos
will never happen again.

Letters to the Editor
Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi
dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven

subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.

iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by

Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit
ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my

Stanford undergraduates are experi

soon be further exacerbated by
next year's renovation of Branner
Hall. By opening up Sharon Green and
Oak Creek Apartments to undergraduates
and converting study rooms into bed
rooms, the University has temporarily im
proved the situation. However, Student
Housing Services and Residential Educa
tion are now considering increasing occu
pancy on the Row as a whole, by adding a
"few spaces from house to house," accord
ing to John Judicki, associate director of
Res Ed. We hope that this strategy of in
creasing occupancy in already-existing
spaces does not morph from a temporary
fix to a permanent solution.
The remodeling of Mirrielees has yield
ed 150 more beds for undergraduates at

the Row could greatly reduce the quality of
upperclass housing at Stanford. We realize
the only permanent solution to this situa

If beds added to Row houses are not re

could mark the beginning of a reduction in
the quality of undergraduate life. Immedi
ate concerns in increasing the Row's popu

kitchen, bathroom, common area and
parking facilities to accommodate the
extra occupants.
Many variables contribute to the housing
shortage. For example, the number of stu
dents that return from studying abroad or
stopping out in the winter far outweighs
the number leaving for Spring Quarter.
Also, the trend of consecutively higher
yield rates than projected by the Office of

Undergraduate Admission require space
for new students to effectively materialize

Student Housing Services planned the
conversion of Mirrielees to coincide with

only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely
sure what the letters "U.S.A." stand for.
The spec tacle of American ignorance
is immensely entertaining to Canadians,
as demonstrated in"This Hour Has 22
Minutes," a Canadian sketch-comedy
show that highlights the unparalleled
willingness of our people to speak at
great lengths on topics they know abso
lutely nothing about. In a skit entitled
"Talking to Americans," host Rick Mer
cer, in the guise of a reporter, interviews
people on the streets of American cities
for their opinion on Canadian "issues"
such as the legalization of insulin and
the melting of the national igloo.
He also invites people to offer a greet
ing to the Canadian people based on his
questions, eliciting responses like "Con
gratulations, Canada, on making beaver
balls your national dish" (from a ran
dom passerby in Chicago) and "I'm glad
to have the support of Prime Minister
Jean Pontine" (from Texas governor
and then-candidate George W. Bush).
This, as you can imagine, causes Cana
dian viewers to clutch their moose and
howl with laughter.
So what are the hot-button issues
that keep our diplomatic corps working
around the clock? To find out, I
checked with the U.S. Embassy in Ot
tawa (also known as the U.S. Foreign
Service Official Retirement Home). The
"Recent Headlines" section on the Em
bassy's Web page included such press
stopping crises as "Canadian Tomatoes
Dumped on U.S. Markets," "Lumber
Imports: Issues and Events" and "U.S.
to Pursue Action Against Monopolistic
Canadian Wheat Board." It is time
someone had the courage to take on
Canadian wheat. Our children must not
grow up in the threatening shadow of a
stockpile of dietary fiber.
What hurts is that I have the suspi
cion that Canada is holding back on
purpose. When I was overseas, you
could tell the Canadian tourists by the
maple-leaf flag stitched squarely on the
center of their backpack, a tasteful and
subtle way of proclaiming "NOT an ugly
American." There have been painful
misunderstandings in the past. We gave
them boy bands and chain stores. They
gave us Alan is Morrisette and a sorry,
rubbery excuse for bacon. But these
foolish games are tearing us apart.
I would like to take this opportunity
to extend the olive branch to our frosty,
maple-scented friends to the north.
While the Bush administration tackles
the Axis of Evil, we here at Stanford can
do our part for world peace by con
fronting the "Axis of' Eh?'."
Learn something about Canada.
Look at a map. Do something to de
crease your glaring ignorance, because
this past month has shown us the terri
ble, strong arm of Canadian politics.
And that is just over figure skating. God
only knows what else they are capable of.
And Canada, let us try, in our bum
bling American way, to be your friend.
Call us for pick-up games of hockey. In
vite us over for beaver balls. We will
learn from each other, and united we
will ensure that the tragedy of the Expos
will never happen again.

Letters to the Editor
Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi
dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit
ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them

Please see LETTERS, page 5

Stanford undergraduates are experi
encing a housing crunch that will
soon be further exacerbated by
next year's renovation of Branner
Hall. By opening up Sharon Green and
Oak Creek Apartments to undergraduates
and converting study rooms into bed
rooms, the University has temporarily im
proved the situation. However, Student
Housing Services and Residential Educa
tion are now considering increasing occu
pancy on the Row as a whole, by adding a
"few spaces from house to house," accord
ing to John Judicki, associate director of
Res Ed. We hope that this strategy of in
creasing occupancy in already-existing
spaces does not morph from a temporary
fix to a permanent solution.
The remodeling of Mirrielees has yield
ed 150 more beds for undergraduates at

the cost of drastically reducing the amount
of space per person in a popular upper
class dorm. Performing similar changes to
the Row could greatly reduce the quality of
upperclass housing at Stanford. We realize
the only permanent solution to this situa
tion is to build more undergraduate hous
ing, and we hope the University expedites
that process.
The attraction of four years of guaran
teed undergraduate housing, coupled with
the variety of housing options, has long
been a factor in drawing students to Stan
ford and making the University affordable.
With outrageous area housing prices, four
years of guaranteed housing allows many
students to attend Stanford who would oth
erwise have faced financial hardship in hav
ing to secure housing in the area. Prospec
tive students have been impressed with

Stanford's living spaces, but a Pro Fro stay
ing with four students in an old Kimball
study room might opt for more spacious
pastures at one of our peer institutions.
If beds added to Row houses are not re
moved after the Branner renovation, it
could mark the beginning of a reduction in
the quality of undergraduate life. Immedi
ate concerns in increasing the Row's popu
lation would be the lack of adequate
kitchen, bathroom, common area and
parking facilities to accommodate the
extra occupants.
Many variables contribute to the housing
shortage. For example, the number of stu
dents that return from studying abroad or
stopping out in the winter far outweighs
the number leaving for Spring Quarter.
Also, the trend of consecutively higher
yield rates than projected by the Office of

Undergraduate Admission require space
for new students to effectively materialize
from nowhere.
Student Housing Services planned the
conversion of Mirrielees to coincide with
Branner's remodeling and minimize bed
losses. Perhaps it should have planned to
open a new dorm during the year of Bran
ner's shutdown as well.
The University is working to ensure that
all undergraduates are housed, but we
hope that any beds added to the Row are
removed once Branner reopens. The fu
ture completion of new dorms, combined
with careful projection of the number of
new students by the Admission Office will
hopefully solve this housing problem and
remove the need to shuffle students into
makeshift housing or off-campus apart
ment complexes.

RUNNING ON EMPTY
American hosers should
learn about Canada, eh
We live in a troubled world. Vio
lence in the Middle East, unrest
in India and the specter of in
ternational terrorism demand the con
stant vigilance of our best and brightest
minds, leaving the rest of us with little to
do. So in the spirit of investigative jour
nalism and the promotion of internation
al understanding, "Running on Empty"
shines the light on an enigma much clos
er to home, with t he conviction that igno
rance is our greatest vulnerability.
This week's issue: Canada.
I am fascinated by Canada. At 3.8
million square miles, Canada is the sec-
ond-largest country in
the world. I would love
to hike in its Rockies.
I'd like to experience
the sights and sounds of
Montreal. But most of
all, I want to know how
a nation that occupies a
sizeable percentage of
the planet's surface area
has managed to attract
less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
This low profile is intriguing and,
frankly, a little suspicious. Don't you
think it's strange that although the
United States and Canada share the
longest unguarded border in the
world, only Alan Thicke and Alex Tre
bek have bothered to cross to our side?
(This is a slight exaggeration. Several
have also snuck across under the guise
of the National Hockey League).
Don't you find it odd that although
the vast majority of the Canadian popu
lation lives along the U.S. border, North
Dakota has never once had to call and
ask them to turn their music down?
What are they doing up there? Doesn't it
creep you out? Don't you want to know?
You probably don't, because the only
thing more disconcerting than Canada it
self is the fact that most Americans are
only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely

dian viewers to clutch their moose and

RUNNING ON EMPTY
American hosers should
learn about Canada, eh
We live in a troubled world. Vio
lence in the Middle East, unrest
in India and the specter of in
ternational terrorism demand the con
stant vigilance of our best and brightest
minds, leaving the rest of us with little to
do. So in the spirit of investigative jour
nalism and the promotion of internation
al understanding, "Running on Empty"
shines the light on an enigma much clos
er to home, with t he conviction that igno
rance is our greatest vulnerability.
This week's issue: Canada.
I am fascinated by Canada. At 3.8
million square miles, Canada is the sec-
ond-largest country in
the world. I would love
to hike in its Rockies.
I'd like to experience
the sights and sounds of
Montreal. But most of
all, I want to know how
a nation that occupies a
sizeable percentage of
the planet's surface area
has managed to attract
less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
This low profile is intriguing and,
frankly, a little suspicious. Don't you
think it's strange that although the
United States and Canada share the
longest unguarded border in the
world, only Alan Thicke and Alex Tre
bek have bothered to cross to our side?
(This is a slight exaggeration. Several
have also snuck across under the guise
of the National Hockey League).
Don't you find it odd that although
the vast majority of the Canadian popu
lation lives along the U.S. border, North
Dakota has never once had to call and
ask them to turn their music down?
What are they doing up there? Doesn't it
creep you out? Don't you want to know?
You probably don't, because the only
thing more disconcerting than Canada it
self is the fact that most Americans are
only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely
sure what the letters "U.S.A." stand for.
The spec tacle of American ignorance
is immensely entertaining to Canadians,
as demonstrated in"This Hour Has 22
Minutes," a Canadian sketch-comedy
show that highlights the unparalleled
willingness of our people to speak at
great lengths on topics they know abso
lutely nothing about. In a skit entitled
"Talking to Americans," host Rick Mer
cer, in the guise of a reporter, interviews
people on the streets of American cities
for their opinion on Canadian "issues"
such as the legalization of insulin and
the melting of the national igloo.
He also invites people to offer a greet
ing to the Canadian people based on his
questions, eliciting responses like "Con
gratulations, Canada, on making beaver
balls your national dish" (from a ran
dom passerby in Chicago) and "I'm glad
to have the support of Prime Minister
Jean Pontine" (from Texas governor
and then-candidate George W. Bush).
This, as you can imagine, causes Cana
dian viewers to clutch their moose and
howl with laughter.
So what are the hot-button issues
that keep our diplomatic corps working
around the clock? To find out, I
checked with the U.S. Embassy in Ot
tawa (also known as the U.S. Foreign
Service Official Retirement Home). The
"Recent Headlines" section on the Em
bassy's Web page included such press
stopping crises as "Canadian Tomatoes
Dumped on U.S. Markets," "Lumber
Imports: Issues and Events" and "U.S.
to Pursue Action Against Monopolistic
Canadian Wheat Board." It is time
someone had the courage to take on
Canadian wheat. Our children must not
grow up in the threatening shadow of a
stockpile of dietary fiber.
What hurts is that I have the suspi
cion that Canada is holding back on
purpose. When I was overseas, you
could tell the Canadian tourists by the
maple-leaf flag stitched squarely on the
center of their backpack, a tasteful and
subtle way of proclaiming "NOT an ugly
American." There have been painful
misunderstandings in the past. We gave
them boy bands and chain stores. They
gave us Alan is Morrisette and a sorry,
rubbery excuse for bacon. But these
foolish games are tearing us apart.
I would like to take this opportunity
to extend the olive branch to our frosty,
maple-scented friends to the north.
While the Bush administration tackles
the Axis of Evil, we here at Stanford can
do our part for world peace by con
fronting the "Axis of' Eh?'."
Learn something about Canada.
Look at a map. Do something to de
crease your glaring ignorance, because
this past month has shown us the terri
ble, strong arm of Canadian politics.
And that is just over figure skating. God
only knows what else they are capable of.
And Canada, let us try, in our bum
bling American way, to be your friend.
Call us for pick-up games of hockey. In
vite us over for beaver balls. We will
learn from each other, and united we
will ensure that the tragedy of the Expos
will never happen again.

Letters to the Editor
Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi
dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit
ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary

Stanford undergraduates are experi
encing a housing crunch that will
soon be further exacerbated by
next year's renovation of Branner
Hall. By opening up Sharon Green and
Oak Creek Apartments to undergraduates
and converting study rooms into bed
rooms, the University has temporarily im
proved the situation. However, Student
Housing Services and Residential Educa
tion are now considering increasing occu
pancy on the Row as a whole, by adding a
"few spaces from house to house," accord
ing to John Judicki, associate director of

creasing occupancy in already-existing
spaces does not morph from a temporary
fix to a permanent solution.

the Row could greatly reduce the quality of
upperclass housing at Stanford. We realize
the only permanent solution to this situa
tion is to build more undergraduate hous
ing, and we hope the University expedites
that process.
The attraction of four years of guaran
teed undergraduate housing, coupled with
the variety of housing options, has long
been a factor in drawing students to Stan

With outrageous area housing prices, four
years of guaranteed housing allows many

Stanford's living spaces, but a Pro Fro stay

If beds added to Row houses are not re

could mark the beginning of a reduction in
the quality of undergraduate life. Immedi
ate concerns in increasing the Row's popu
lation would be the lack of adequate
kitchen, bathroom, common area and
parking facilities to accommodate the
extra occupants.
Many variables contribute to the housing
shortage. For example, the number of stu
dents that return from studying abroad or
stopping out in the winter far outweighs
the number leaving for Spring Quarter.
Also, the trend of consecutively higher
yield rates than projected by the Office of

Undergraduate Admission require space
for new students to effectively materialize

all undergraduates are housed, but we
hope that any beds added to the Row are
removed once Branner reopens. The fu

to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi
dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit
ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary

Stanford undergraduates are experi
encing a housing crunch that will
soon be further exacerbated by
next year's renovation of Branner
Hall. By opening up Sharon Green and
Oak Creek Apartments to undergraduates
and converting study rooms into bed
rooms, the University has temporarily im
proved the situation. However, Student
Housing Services and Residential Educa
tion are now considering increasing occu
pancy on the Row as a whole, by adding a
"few spaces from house to house," accord
ing to John Judicki, associate director of
Res Ed. We hope that this strategy of in
creasing occupancy in already-existing
spaces does not morph from a temporary
fix to a permanent solution.
The remodeling of Mirrielees has yield
ed 150 more beds for undergraduates at

the cost of drastically reducing the amount
of space per person in a popular upper
class dorm. Performing similar changes to
the Row could greatly reduce the quality of
upperclass housing at Stanford. We realize
the only permanent solution to this situa
tion is to build more undergraduate hous
ing, and we hope the University expedites
that process.
The attraction of four years of guaran
teed undergraduate housing, coupled with
the variety of housing options, has long
been a factor in drawing students to Stan
ford and making the University affordable.
With outrageous area housing prices, four
years of guaranteed housing allows many
students to attend Stanford who would oth
erwise have faced financial hardship in hav
ing to secure housing in the area. Prospec
tive students have been impressed with

Stanford's living spaces, but a Pro Fro stay
ing with four students in an old Kimball
study room might opt for more spacious
pastures at one of our peer institutions.
If beds added to Row houses are not re
moved after the Branner renovation, it
could mark the beginning of a reduction in
the quality of undergraduate life. Immedi
ate concerns in increasing the Row's popu
lation would be the lack of adequate
kitchen, bathroom, common area and
parking facilities to accommodate the
extra occupants.
Many variables contribute to the housing
shortage. For example, the number of stu
dents that return from studying abroad or
stopping out in the winter far outweighs
the number leaving for Spring Quarter.
Also, the trend of consecutively higher
yield rates than projected by the Office of

Undergraduate Admission require space
for new students to effectively materialize
from nowhere.
Student Housing Services planned the
conversion of Mirrielees to coincide with
Branner's remodeling and minimize bed
losses. Perhaps it should have planned to
open a new dorm during the year of Bran
ner's shutdown as well.
The University is working to ensure that
all undergraduates are housed, but we
hope that any beds added to the Row are
removed once Branner reopens. The fu
ture completion of new dorms, combined
with careful projection of the number of
new students by the Admission Office will
hopefully solve this housing problem and
remove the need to shuffle students into
makeshift housing or off-campus apart
ment complexes.

RUNNING ON EMPTY
American hosers should
learn about Canada, eh
We live in a troubled world. Vio
lence in the Middle East, unrest
in India and the specter of in
ternational terrorism demand the con
stant vigilance of our best and brightest
minds, leaving the rest of us with little to
do. So in the spirit of investigative jour
nalism and the promotion of internation
al understanding, "Running on Empty"
shines the light on an enigma much clos
er to home, with t he conviction that igno
rance is our greatest vulnerability.
This week's issue: Canada.
I am fascinated by Canada. At 3.8
million square miles, Canada is the sec-
ond-largest country in
the world. I would love
to hike in its Rockies.
I'd like to experience
the sights and sounds of
Montreal. But most of
all, I want to know how
a nation that occupies a
sizeable percentage of
the planet's surface area
has managed to attract
less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
This low profile is intriguing and,
frankly, a little suspicious. Don't you
think it's strange that although the
United States and Canada share the
longest unguarded border in the
world, only Alan Thicke and Alex Tre
bek have bothered to cross to our side?
(This is a slight exaggeration. Several
have also snuck across under the guise
of the National Hockey League).
Don't you find it odd that although
the vast majority of the Canadian popu
lation lives along the U.S. border, North
Dakota has never once had to call and
ask them to turn their music down?
What are they doing up there? Doesn't it
creep you out? Don't you want to know?
You probably don't, because the only
thing more disconcerting than Canada it
self is the fact that most Americans are
only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely
sure what the letters "U.S.A." stand for.
The spec tacle of American ignorance
is immensely entertaining to Canadians,
as demonstrated in"This Hour Has 22
Minutes," a Canadian sketch-comedy
show that highlights the unparalleled
willingness of our people to speak at
great lengths on topics they know abso
lutely nothing about. In a skit entitled
"Talking to Americans," host Rick Mer
cer, in the guise of a reporter, interviews
people on the streets of American cities
for their opinion on Canadian "issues"
such as the legalization of insulin and
the melting of the national igloo.
He also invites people to offer a greet
ing to the Canadian people based on his
questions, eliciting responses like "Con
gratulations, Canada, on making beaver
balls your national dish" (from a ran
dom passerby in Chicago) and "I'm glad
to have the support of Prime Minister
Jean Pontine" (from Texas governor
and then-candidate George W. Bush).
This, as you can imagine, causes Cana
dian viewers to clutch their moose and
howl with laughter.
So what are the hot-button issues
that keep our diplomatic corps working
around the clock? To find out, I
checked with the U.S. Embassy in Ot
tawa (also known as the U.S. Foreign
Service Official Retirement Home). The
"Recent Headlines" section on the Em
bassy's Web page included such press
stopping crises as "Canadian Tomatoes
Dumped on U.S. Markets," "Lumber
Imports: Issues and Events" and "U.S.
to Pursue Action Against Monopolistic
Canadian Wheat Board." It is time
someone had the courage to take on
Canadian wheat. Our children must not
grow up in the threatening shadow of a
stockpile of dietary fiber.
What hurts is that I have the suspi
cion that Canada is holding back on
purpose. When I was overseas, you
could tell the Canadian tourists by the
maple-leaf flag stitched squarely on the
center of their backpack, a tasteful and
subtle way of proclaiming "NOT an ugly
American." There have been painful
misunderstandings in the past. We gave
them boy bands and chain stores. They
gave us Alan is Morrisette and a sorry,
rubbery excuse for bacon. But these
foolish games are tearing us apart.
I would like to take this opportunity
to extend the olive branch to our frosty,
maple-scented friends to the north.
While the Bush administration tackles
the Axis of Evil, we here at Stanford can
do our part for world peace by con
fronting the "Axis of' Eh?'."
Learn something about Canada.
Look at a map. Do something to de
crease your glaring ignorance, because
this past month has shown us the terri
ble, strong arm of Canadian politics.
And that is just over figure skating. God
only knows what else they are capable of.
And Canada, let us try, in our bum
bling American way, to be your friend.
Call us for pick-up games of hockey. In
vite us over for beaver balls. We will
learn from each other, and united we
will ensure that the tragedy of the Expos
will never happen again.

Letters to the Editor
Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.
