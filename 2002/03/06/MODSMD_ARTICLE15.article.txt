# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## American hosers should learn about Canada, eh 
### 
We live in a troubled world. Vio
lence in the Middle East, unrest
in India and the specter of in
ternational terrorism demand the con
stant vigilance of our best and brightest
minds, leaving the rest of us with little to
do. So in the spirit of investigative jour
nalism and the promotion of internation
al understanding, "Running on Empty"
shines the light on an enigma much clos
er to home, with t he conviction that igno
rance is our greatest vulnerability.
This week's issue: Canada.
I am fascinated by Canada. At 3.8
million square miles, Canada is the sec-

ond-largest country in
the world. I would love
to hike in its Rockies.
I'd like to experience
the sights and sounds of
Montreal. But most of
all, I want to know how
a nation that occupies a
sizeable percentage of
the planet's surface area
has managed to attract

less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
This low profile is intriguing and,
frankly, a little suspicious. Don't you
think it's strange that although the
United States and Canada share the
longest unguarded border in the
world, only Alan Thicke and Alex Tre
bek have bothered to cross to our side?
(This is a slight exaggeration. Several
have also snuck across under the guise
of the National Hockey League).
Don't you find it odd that although
the vast majority of the Canadian popu
lation lives along the U.S. border, North
Dakota has never once had to call and
ask them to turn their music down?
What are they doing up there? Doesn't it
creep you out? Don't you want to know?
You probably don't, because the only
thing more disconcerting than Canada it
self is the fact that most Americans are
only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely
sure what the letters "U.S.A." stand for.
The spec tacle of American ignorance
is immensely entertaining to Canadians,
as demonstrated in"This Hour Has 22
Minutes," a Canadian sketch-comedy
show that highlights the unparalleled
willingness of our people to speak at
great lengths on topics they know abso
lutely nothing about. In a skit entitled
"Talking to Americans," host Rick Mer
cer, in the guise of a reporter, interviews
people on the streets of American cities
for their opinion on Canadian "issues"
such as the legalization of insulin and
the melting of the national igloo.

He also invites people to offer a greet
ing to the Canadian people based on his
questions, eliciting responses like "Con
gratulations, Canada, on making beaver
balls your national dish" (from a ran
dom passerby in Chicago) and "I'm glad
to have the support of Prime Minister
Jean Pontine" (from Texas governor
and then-candidate George W. Bush).
This, as you can imagine, causes Cana
dian viewers to clutch their moose and
howl with laughter.
So what are the hot-button issues
that keep our diplomatic corps working
around the clock? To find out, I
checked with the U.S. Embassy in Ot
tawa (also known as the U.S. Foreign
Service Official Retirement Home). The
"Recent Headlines" section on the Em
bassy's Web page included such press
stopping crises as "Canadian Tomatoes
Dumped on U.S. Markets," "Lumber
Imports: Issues and Events" and "U.S.
to Pursue Action Against Monopolistic
Canadian Wheat Board." It is time
someone had the courage to take on
Canadian wheat. Our children must not
grow up in the threatening shadow of a
stockpile of dietary fiber.
What hurts is that I have the suspi
cion that Canada is holding back on
purpose. When I was overseas, you
could tell the Canadian tourists by the
maple-leaf flag stitched squarely on the
center of their backpack, a tasteful and
subtle way of proclaiming "NOT an ugly
American." There have been painful
misunderstandings in the past. We gave
them boy bands and chain stores. They
gave us Alan is Morrisette and a sorry,
rubbery excuse for bacon. But these
foolish games are tearing us apart.
I would like to take this opportunity
to extend the olive branch to our frosty,
maple-scented friends to the north.
While the Bush administration tackles
the Axis of Evil, we here at Stanford can
do our part for world peace by con
fronting the "Axis of' Eh?'."
Learn something about Canada.
Look at a map. Do something to de
crease your glaring ignorance, because
this past month has shown us the terri
ble, strong arm of Canadian politics.
And that is just over figure skating. God
only knows what else they are capable of.
And Canada, let us try, in our bum
bling American way, to be your friend.
Call us for pick-up games of hockey. In
vite us over for beaver balls. We will
learn from each other, and united we
will ensure that the tragedy of the Expos
will never happen again.

the planet's surface area
has managed to attract

less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
This low profile is intriguing and,
frankly, a little suspicious. Don't you
think it's strange that although the
United States and Canada share the
longest unguarded border in the
world, only Alan Thicke and Alex Tre
bek have bothered to cross to our side?
(This is a slight exaggeration. Several
have also snuck across under the guise
of the National Hockey League).
Don't you find it odd that although
the vast majority of the Canadian popu
lation lives along the U.S. border, North
Dakota has never once had to call and
ask them to turn their music down?
What are they doing up there? Doesn't it
creep you out? Don't you want to know?
You probably don't, because the only
thing more disconcerting than Canada it
self is the fact that most Americans are
only dimly aware of the fact that we share
the continent. This is hardly surprising;
judging from U.S. test scores in geogra
phy, the average American is not entirely
sure what the letters "U.S.A." stand for.
The spec tacle of American ignorance
is immensely entertaining to Canadians,
as demonstrated in"This Hour Has 22
Minutes," a Canadian sketch-comedy
show that highlights the unparalleled
willingness of our people to speak at
great lengths on topics they know abso
lutely nothing about. In a skit entitled
"Talking to Americans," host Rick Mer
cer, in the guise of a reporter, interviews
people on the streets of American cities
for their opinion on Canadian "issues"
such as the legalization of insulin and
the melting of the national igloo.

He also invites people to offer a greet
ing to the Canadian people based on his
questions, eliciting responses like "Con
gratulations, Canada, on making beaver
balls your national dish" (from a ran
dom passerby in Chicago) and "I'm glad
to have the support of Prime Minister
Jean Pontine" (from Texas governor
and then-candidate George W. Bush).
This, as you can imagine, causes Cana
dian viewers to clutch their moose and
howl with laughter.
So what are the hot-button issues
that keep our diplomatic corps working
around the clock? To find out, I
checked with the U.S. Embassy in Ot
tawa (also known as the U.S. Foreign
Service Official Retirement Home). The
"Recent Headlines" section on the Em
bassy's Web page included such press
stopping crises as "Canadian Tomatoes
Dumped on U.S. Markets," "Lumber
Imports: Issues and Events" and "U.S.
to Pursue Action Against Monopolistic
Canadian Wheat Board." It is time
someone had the courage to take on
Canadian wheat. Our children must not
grow up in the threatening shadow of a
stockpile of dietary fiber.
What hurts is that I have the suspi
cion that Canada is holding back on
purpose. When I was overseas, you
could tell the Canadian tourists by the
maple-leaf flag stitched squarely on the
center of their backpack, a tasteful and
subtle way of proclaiming "NOT an ugly
American." There have been painful
misunderstandings in the past. We gave
them boy bands and chain stores. They
gave us Alan is Morrisette and a sorry,
rubbery excuse for bacon. But these
foolish games are tearing us apart.
I would like to take this opportunity
to extend the olive branch to our frosty,
maple-scented friends to the north.
While the Bush administration tackles
the Axis of Evil, we here at Stanford can
do our part for world peace by con
fronting the "Axis of' Eh?'."
Learn something about Canada.
Look at a map. Do something to de
crease your glaring ignorance, because
this past month has shown us the terri
ble, strong arm of Canadian politics.
And that is just over figure skating. God
only knows what else they are capable of.
And Canada, let us try, in our bum
bling American way, to be your friend.
Call us for pick-up games of hockey. In
vite us over for beaver balls. We will
learn from each other, and united we
will ensure that the tragedy of the Expos
will never happen again.

We live in a troubled world. Vio
lence in the Middle East, unrest
in India and the specter of in
ternational terrorism demand the con
stant vigilance of our best and brightest
minds, leaving the rest of us with little to
do. So in the spirit of investigative jour
nalism and the promotion of internation
al understanding, "Running on Empty"
shines the light on an enigma much clos
er to home, with t he conviction that igno
rance is our greatest vulnerability.
This week's issue: Canada.
I am fascinated by Canada. At 3.8
million square miles, Canada is the sec-

ond-largest country in
the world. I would love
to hike in its Rockies.
I'd like to experience
the sights and sounds of
Montreal. But most of
all, I want to know how
a nation that occupies a
sizeable percentage of
the planet's surface area
has managed to attract

less international attention that Britney
Spears' navel.
