Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi

dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit

ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary
times. Women have been stripped of
their special nature, their fertility and
their deepest longings as women, as
well as the social taboos that once pro
tected them from being taken advan
tage of sexually.
In short, women have lost them
selves. Feminism has made speaking of
womanhood or what it means to be a
man seem ridiculous and embarrass
ing—this is simply not what we talk
about in polite conversation.
But equal does not necessarily mean
interchangeable. To pretend that
dressing and acting like men and living
side by side makes everything "equal" is
a delusion. It is one of the most mysog
ynistic ideas conceivable, really, be
cause, as the past few decades have
shown, it ultimately despises anything
particular to women. We can be just as
crude, just as cocky, just as sexually
ravenous, so goes the rhetoric. This be
lief glorifies neither men nor women.
The last fifty years have proved that
when the natural differences between
the sexes are not honored, the pendu
lum inevitably swings too heavily to one
side, and women just happen to be the
ones who are hurt the most.
At the Viennese Ball, the nuanced
atmosphere of sexual modesty on the
part of both sexes pervades if only for
the night. It opens the door for an ex
citing, romantic time that makes the
brazen "let's just get to the point" atti
tude of the club pale in comparison.

PWR class clarifies intent of
Hoover exhibit
On March 4, The Daily published a
letter objecting that our exhibit —
Eric Holler's True Believer: Manifes
tations in Mass Movements" —
grouped the American civil rights
movement with the Nazi movement in
Germany. While we thank the con
cerned visitor for her feedback, we
would like to clarify our intentions.
Esteemed social philosopher Eric
Hoffer formulated a science through
which to objectively articulate the nature
of mass movements — our exhibit fea
tures primary texts and images from
several such movements. To illustrate
the universality of Hoffer's assertions,
we consciously chose material from both
positive and negative movements. We
seek neither to disparage the civil rights
movement nor to uplift National Social
ism; however, since both are mass move
ments, both fall into our realm of study
and belong in our cases. We encourage
all readers to see the exhibit, located im
mediately inside Hoover Tower, for
themselves.

Parents suppressed chance at
"civil discussion"
I enjoyed a lovely visit to the campus
for various activities on Parents Weekend.
However, there was one incident that
continues to concern me, namely, the dis
ruption that occurred during University
President John Hennessy's question-and
answer session at Memorial Auditorium.
A young man who identified himself
as a Muslim and a law student came to

the balcony microphone to ask Presi
dent Hennessy about the choice of Na
tional Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice as this year's Commencement
speaker, considering her role in the
"fascist" policies of the government.
Loud boos immediately erupted from a
proportion of the audience, ruining the
climate fora dispassionate response.
I was disappointed, first of all, that
the audience was unable to muster sup
port fora civil discussion of a very seri
ous and challenging issue, and second,
that there were persons in that audience
who apparently did not believe in the
hope for attaining knowledge, under
standing and human dignity that is of
fered by the exercise of intellectual free
dom in the sett ing of a great university.

Band restrictions, alcohol probations
have undermined campus personality
In forming an opinion about the Uni
versity's decision to ban the Stanford
Band from the Pac-1() Men's and
Women's Basketball Tournaments, we
must not only look at whether the
Band's behavior was justified, but at how
this probation fits into the long history
of the Band and the University itself.
One of my first Stanford memories,
from Admit Weekend four years ago,
was going inside the now-demolished
Band ShaK and being disgusted with the
smell and general condition of the
building. But hey, 1 figured that was
cool if tney were cool with filth.
The Daily argues that the Band has
now committed "destruction of proper
ty" by throwing up inside the Shak
("LSJUMB's behavior necessitates
tighter sanctions," 3/5/02). Apparently
this was fine until now — I have trouble

believing that no one has previously
booted in the Shak, given the smell 1 so
distinctly remember.
Also, isn't the Band Shak condemned
anyway? And why is the Shak now Uni
versity-cleaned? It seems to me that
University cleaning provides an unoffi
cial chaperone who will always be there
to discover any of the alcohol-related ac
tivities that are now called "violations." I
can't believe that the old Shak was
cleaned by anyone, let alone a profes
sional worker. When it comes down to it,
the things that are now considered vio
lations once created such amazing
events as the Shak party during fresh
man orientation. Shak party '98 . . . now
that was a good time.
This brings me to another point,
which is a gripe with recent treatment
of alcohol-related events. I will begin by
saying that I know that my opinions
cannot be justified, because federal
highway funding dictates a drinking
age of 21. Therefore, this letter has the
aim not to change, or debate unfortu
nate policy, but to reminisce about the
lenient policy of a bygone day.
As a freshman, four years ago, there
were plenty of events wnere alcohol was
the main focus. Sure, there was usually
some stupid theme, but no one cared
about that.
"Dude, four kegs at Branner," or
maybe ten of Natty Light at now-dry
Kappa Sig. These parties were crazy
fun, and the University didn't seem to
care. We loved our administration for
turning its back — we heard horror
stories of police-like RAs at dry cam
puses around the country.
However, it seems like in the last few
years someone has decided that all the
requisite fun has been had — maybe
it's lawyers, I don't know ... it doesn't
matter.
The Shak is dry?! Let's stop kidding
ourselves. Alcohol is a major focus of the
Band's events. That's what they're noto
rious for. And now we're holding them

to some lofty ideal where we care about
their (historically terrible) music and
feel they should act as an ambassador?
1 want them to be an ambassador of
drunkenness and debauchery like they
always were. It would be sad to see the
Band's old spirit go — does anyone re
ally want them to become just another
one of those lame-marcning-bands
dressed-in-funny-hats-that-we-make-
fun-of-at-football-games? No!
The flood of recent alcohol proba
tions has sadly squelched the opportu
nity for new students to drink ' velvet
hammers" from toilet bowls in the
trashed Band Shak or to forget what
happened the night before at Kappa
Sig. It's true, these activities aren't com
pletely within the letter of the law, but
it's events like these that make up the
bulk of my draw group's best collective
stories and define the traditional Ani
mal House-style college life.

etly expelled from this prestigious uni

would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi

dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit

ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary
times. Women have been stripped of
their special nature, their fertility and
their deepest longings as women, as
well as the social taboos that once pro
tected them from being taken advan
tage of sexually.
In short, women have lost them
selves. Feminism has made speaking of
womanhood or what it means to be a
man seem ridiculous and embarrass
ing—this is simply not what we talk
about in polite conversation.
But equal does not necessarily mean
interchangeable. To pretend that
dressing and acting like men and living
side by side makes everything "equal" is
a delusion. It is one of the most mysog
ynistic ideas conceivable, really, be
cause, as the past few decades have
shown, it ultimately despises anything
particular to women. We can be just as
crude, just as cocky, just as sexually
ravenous, so goes the rhetoric. This be
lief glorifies neither men nor women.
The last fifty years have proved that
when the natural differences between
the sexes are not honored, the pendu
lum inevitably swings too heavily to one
side, and women just happen to be the
ones who are hurt the most.
At the Viennese Ball, the nuanced
atmosphere of sexual modesty on the
part of both sexes pervades if only for
the night. It opens the door for an ex
citing, romantic time that makes the
brazen "let's just get to the point" atti
tude of the club pale in comparison.

Parents suppressed chance at
"civil discussion"
I enjoyed a lovely visit to the campus
for various activities on Parents Weekend.
However, there was one incident that
continues to concern me, namely, the dis
ruption that occurred during University
President John Hennessy's question-and
answer session at Memorial Auditorium.
A young man who identified himself
as a Muslim and a law student came to

the balcony microphone to ask Presi
dent Hennessy about the choice of Na
tional Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice as this year's Commencement
speaker, considering her role in the
"fascist" policies of the government.
Loud boos immediately erupted from a
proportion of the audience, ruining the
climate fora dispassionate response.
I was disappointed, first of all, that
the audience was unable to muster sup
port fora civil discussion of a very seri
ous and challenging issue, and second,
that there were persons in that audience
who apparently did not believe in the
hope for attaining knowledge, under

Band restrictions, alcohol probations
have undermined campus personality
In forming an opinion about the Uni
versity's decision to ban the Stanford
Band from the Pac-1() Men's and
Women's Basketball Tournaments, we
must not only look at whether the
Band's behavior was justified, but at how
this probation fits into the long history
of the Band and the University itself.
One of my first Stanford memories,
from Admit Weekend four years ago,
was going inside the now-demolished
Band ShaK and being disgusted with the
smell and general condition of the
building. But hey, 1 figured that was
cool if tney were cool with filth.
The Daily argues that the Band has
now committed "destruction of proper
ty" by throwing up inside the Shak
("LSJUMB's behavior necessitates
tighter sanctions," 3/5/02). Apparently
this was fine until now — I have trouble

believing that no one has previously
booted in the Shak, given the smell 1 so
distinctly remember.
Also, isn't the Band Shak condemned
anyway? And why is the Shak now Uni
versity-cleaned? It seems to me that
University cleaning provides an unoffi
cial chaperone who will always be there
to discover any of the alcohol-related ac
tivities that are now called "violations." I
can't believe that the old Shak was
cleaned by anyone, let alone a profes
sional worker. When it comes down to it,
the things that are now considered vio
lations once created such amazing
events as the Shak party during fresh
man orientation. Shak party '98 . . . now
that was a good time.
This brings me to another point,
which is a gripe with recent treatment
of alcohol-related events. I will begin by
saying that I know that my opinions
cannot be justified, because federal
highway funding dictates a drinking
age of 21. Therefore, this letter has the
aim not to change, or debate unfortu
nate policy, but to reminisce about the
lenient policy of a bygone day.
As a freshman, four years ago, there
were plenty of events wnere alcohol was
the main focus. Sure, there was usually
some stupid theme, but no one cared
about that.
"Dude, four kegs at Branner," or
maybe ten of Natty Light at now-dry
Kappa Sig. These parties were crazy
fun, and the University didn't seem to
care. We loved our administration for
turning its back — we heard horror
stories of police-like RAs at dry cam
puses around the country.
However, it seems like in the last few
years someone has decided that all the
requisite fun has been had — maybe
it's lawyers, I don't know ... it doesn't
matter.
The Shak is dry?! Let's stop kidding
ourselves. Alcohol is a major focus of the
Band's events. That's what they're noto
rious for. And now we're holding them

to some lofty ideal where we care about
their (historically terrible) music and
feel they should act as an ambassador?
1 want them to be an ambassador of
drunkenness and debauchery like they
always were. It would be sad to see the
Band's old spirit go — does anyone re
ally want them to become just another
one of those lame-marcning-bands
dressed-in-funny-hats-that-we-make-
fun-of-at-football-games? No!
The flood of recent alcohol proba
tions has sadly squelched the opportu
nity for new students to drink ' velvet
hammers" from toilet bowls in the
trashed Band Shak or to forget what
happened the night before at Kappa
Sig. It's true, these activities aren't com
pletely within the letter of the law, but
it's events like these that make up the
bulk of my draw group's best collective
stories and define the traditional Ani
mal House-style college life.

Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni

most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi

dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit

ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary
times. Women have been stripped of
their special nature, their fertility and
their deepest longings as women, as
well as the social taboos that once pro
tected them from being taken advan
tage of sexually.
In short, women have lost them
selves. Feminism has made speaking of
womanhood or what it means to be a
man seem ridiculous and embarrass
ing—this is simply not what we talk
about in polite conversation.
But equal does not necessarily mean
interchangeable. To pretend that
dressing and acting like men and living
side by side makes everything "equal" is
a delusion. It is one of the most mysog
ynistic ideas conceivable, really, be
cause, as the past few decades have
shown, it ultimately despises anything
particular to women. We can be just as
crude, just as cocky, just as sexually
ravenous, so goes the rhetoric. This be
lief glorifies neither men nor women.
The last fifty years have proved that
when the natural differences between
the sexes are not honored, the pendu
lum inevitably swings too heavily to one
side, and women just happen to be the
ones who are hurt the most.
At the Viennese Ball, the nuanced
atmosphere of sexual modesty on the
part of both sexes pervades if only for
the night. It opens the door for an ex
citing, romantic time that makes the
brazen "let's just get to the point" atti
tude of the club pale in comparison.

PWR class clarifies intent of
Hoover exhibit
On March 4, The Daily published a
letter objecting that our exhibit —
Eric Holler's True Believer: Manifes
tations in Mass Movements" —
grouped the American civil rights
movement with the Nazi movement in
Germany. While we thank the con
cerned visitor for her feedback, we
would like to clarify our intentions.
Esteemed social philosopher Eric
Hoffer formulated a science through
which to objectively articulate the nature
of mass movements — our exhibit fea
tures primary texts and images from
several such movements. To illustrate
the universality of Hoffer's assertions,
we consciously chose material from both
positive and negative movements. We
seek neither to disparage the civil rights
movement nor to uplift National Social
ism; however, since both are mass move
ments, both fall into our realm of study
and belong in our cases. We encourage
all readers to see the exhibit, located im
mediately inside Hoover Tower, for
themselves.

Parents suppressed chance at
"civil discussion"
I enjoyed a lovely visit to the campus
for various activities on Parents Weekend.
However, there was one incident that
continues to concern me, namely, the dis
ruption that occurred during University
President John Hennessy's question-and
answer session at Memorial Auditorium.
A young man who identified himself
as a Muslim and a law student came to

the balcony microphone to ask Presi
dent Hennessy about the choice of Na
tional Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice as this year's Commencement
speaker, considering her role in the
"fascist" policies of the government.
Loud boos immediately erupted from a
proportion of the audience, ruining the
climate fora dispassionate response.
I was disappointed, first of all, that
the audience was unable to muster sup
port fora civil discussion of a very seri
ous and challenging issue, and second,
that there were persons in that audience
who apparently did not believe in the
hope for attaining knowledge, under
standing and human dignity that is of
fered by the exercise of intellectual free
dom in the sett ing of a great university.

Band restrictions, alcohol probations
have undermined campus personality
In forming an opinion about the Uni
versity's decision to ban the Stanford
Band from the Pac-1() Men's and
Women's Basketball Tournaments, we
must not only look at whether the
Band's behavior was justified, but at how
this probation fits into the long history
of the Band and the University itself.
One of my first Stanford memories,
from Admit Weekend four years ago,
was going inside the now-demolished
Band ShaK and being disgusted with the
smell and general condition of the
building. But hey, 1 figured that was
cool if tney were cool with filth.
The Daily argues that the Band has
now committed "destruction of proper
ty" by throwing up inside the Shak
("LSJUMB's behavior necessitates
tighter sanctions," 3/5/02). Apparently
this was fine until now — I have trouble

believing that no one has previously
booted in the Shak, given the smell 1 so
distinctly remember.
Also, isn't the Band Shak condemned
anyway? And why is the Shak now Uni
versity-cleaned? It seems to me that
University cleaning provides an unoffi
cial chaperone who will always be there
to discover any of the alcohol-related ac
tivities that are now called "violations." I
can't believe that the old Shak was
cleaned by anyone, let alone a profes
sional worker. When it comes down to it,
the things that are now considered vio
lations once created such amazing
events as the Shak party during fresh
man orientation. Shak party '98 . . . now
that was a good time.
This brings me to another point,
which is a gripe with recent treatment
of alcohol-related events. I will begin by
saying that I know that my opinions
cannot be justified, because federal
highway funding dictates a drinking
age of 21. Therefore, this letter has the
aim not to change, or debate unfortu
nate policy, but to reminisce about the
lenient policy of a bygone day.
As a freshman, four years ago, there
were plenty of events wnere alcohol was
the main focus. Sure, there was usually
some stupid theme, but no one cared
about that.
"Dude, four kegs at Branner," or
maybe ten of Natty Light at now-dry
Kappa Sig. These parties were crazy
fun, and the University didn't seem to
care. We loved our administration for
turning its back — we heard horror
stories of police-like RAs at dry cam
puses around the country.
However, it seems like in the last few
years someone has decided that all the
requisite fun has been had — maybe
it's lawyers, I don't know ... it doesn't
matter.
The Shak is dry?! Let's stop kidding
ourselves. Alcohol is a major focus of the
Band's events. That's what they're noto
rious for. And now we're holding them

to some lofty ideal where we care about
their (historically terrible) music and
feel they should act as an ambassador?
1 want them to be an ambassador of
drunkenness and debauchery like they
always were. It would be sad to see the
Band's old spirit go — does anyone re
ally want them to become just another
one of those lame-marcning-bands
dressed-in-funny-hats-that-we-make-
fun-of-at-football-games? No!
The flood of recent alcohol proba
tions has sadly squelched the opportu
nity for new students to drink ' velvet
hammers" from toilet bowls in the
trashed Band Shak or to forget what
happened the night before at Kappa
Sig. It's true, these activities aren't com
pletely within the letter of the law, but
it's events like these that make up the
bulk of my draw group's best collective
stories and define the traditional Ani
mal House-style college life.

Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit

ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary
times. Women have been stripped of
their special nature, their fertility and
their deepest longings as women, as
well as the social taboos that once pro
tected them from being taken advan
tage of sexually.
In short, women have lost them
selves. Feminism has made speaking of
womanhood or what it means to be a
man seem ridiculous and embarrass
ing—this is simply not what we talk
about in polite conversation.
But equal does not necessarily mean
interchangeable. To pretend that
dressing and acting like men and living
side by side makes everything "equal" is
a delusion. It is one of the most mysog
ynistic ideas conceivable, really, be
cause, as the past few decades have
shown, it ultimately despises anything
particular to women. We can be just as
crude, just as cocky, just as sexually
ravenous, so goes the rhetoric. This be
lief glorifies neither men nor women.
The last fifty years have proved that
when the natural differences between
the sexes are not honored, the pendu
lum inevitably swings too heavily to one
side, and women just happen to be the
ones who are hurt the most.
At the Viennese Ball, the nuanced
atmosphere of sexual modesty on the
part of both sexes pervades if only for
the night. It opens the door for an ex
citing, romantic time that makes the
brazen "let's just get to the point" atti
tude of the club pale in comparison.

PWR class clarifies intent of
Hoover exhibit
On March 4, The Daily published a
letter objecting that our exhibit —
Eric Holler's True Believer: Manifes

grouped the American civil rights
movement with the Nazi movement in
Germany. While we thank the con

Esteemed social philosopher Eric

which to objectively articulate the nature
of mass movements — our exhibit fea

the universality of Hoffer's assertions,
we consciously chose material from both
positive and negative movements. We
seek neither to disparage the civil rights

Parents suppressed chance at
"civil discussion"
I enjoyed a lovely visit to the campus
for various activities on Parents Weekend.
However, there was one incident that
continues to concern me, namely, the dis
ruption that occurred during University
President John Hennessy's question-and
answer session at Memorial Auditorium.
A young man who identified himself
as a Muslim and a law student came to

the balcony microphone to ask Presi
dent Hennessy about the choice of Na
tional Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice as this year's Commencement
speaker, considering her role in the
"fascist" policies of the government.
Loud boos immediately erupted from a
proportion of the audience, ruining the
climate fora dispassionate response.
I was disappointed, first of all, that
the audience was unable to muster sup
port fora civil discussion of a very seri
ous and challenging issue, and second,
that there were persons in that audience
who apparently did not believe in the
hope for attaining knowledge, under
standing and human dignity that is of
fered by the exercise of intellectual free
dom in the sett ing of a great university.

Band restrictions, alcohol probations
have undermined campus personality
In forming an opinion about the Uni
versity's decision to ban the Stanford
Band from the Pac-1() Men's and
Women's Basketball Tournaments, we
must not only look at whether the
Band's behavior was justified, but at how
this probation fits into the long history
of the Band and the University itself.
One of my first Stanford memories,
from Admit Weekend four years ago,
was going inside the now-demolished
Band ShaK and being disgusted with the
smell and general condition of the
building. But hey, 1 figured that was
cool if tney were cool with filth.
The Daily argues that the Band has
now committed "destruction of proper
ty" by throwing up inside the Shak
("LSJUMB's behavior necessitates
tighter sanctions," 3/5/02). Apparently
this was fine until now — I have trouble

believing that no one has previously
booted in the Shak, given the smell 1 so
distinctly remember.
Also, isn't the Band Shak condemned
anyway? And why is the Shak now Uni
versity-cleaned? It seems to me that
University cleaning provides an unoffi
cial chaperone who will always be there
to discover any of the alcohol-related ac
tivities that are now called "violations." I
can't believe that the old Shak was
cleaned by anyone, let alone a profes
sional worker. When it comes down to it,
the things that are now considered vio
lations once created such amazing
events as the Shak party during fresh
man orientation. Shak party '98 . . . now
that was a good time.
This brings me to another point,
which is a gripe with recent treatment
of alcohol-related events. I will begin by
saying that I know that my opinions
cannot be justified, because federal
highway funding dictates a drinking
age of 21. Therefore, this letter has the
aim not to change, or debate unfortu
nate policy, but to reminisce about the
lenient policy of a bygone day.
As a freshman, four years ago, there
were plenty of events wnere alcohol was
the main focus. Sure, there was usually
some stupid theme, but no one cared
about that.
"Dude, four kegs at Branner," or
maybe ten of Natty Light at now-dry
Kappa Sig. These parties were crazy
fun, and the University didn't seem to
care. We loved our administration for
turning its back — we heard horror
stories of police-like RAs at dry cam
puses around the country.
However, it seems like in the last few
years someone has decided that all the
requisite fun has been had — maybe
it's lawyers, I don't know ... it doesn't
matter.
The Shak is dry?! Let's stop kidding
ourselves. Alcohol is a major focus of the
Band's events. That's what they're noto
rious for. And now we're holding them

to some lofty ideal where we care about
their (historically terrible) music and
feel they should act as an ambassador?
1 want them to be an ambassador of
drunkenness and debauchery like they
always were. It would be sad to see the
Band's old spirit go — does anyone re
ally want them to become just another
one of those lame-marcning-bands
dressed-in-funny-hats-that-we-make-
fun-of-at-football-games? No!
The flood of recent alcohol proba
tions has sadly squelched the opportu
nity for new students to drink ' velvet
hammers" from toilet bowls in the
trashed Band Shak or to forget what
happened the night before at Kappa
Sig. It's true, these activities aren't com
pletely within the letter of the law, but
it's events like these that make up the
bulk of my draw group's best collective
stories and define the traditional Ani
mal House-style college life.

Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi

dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
