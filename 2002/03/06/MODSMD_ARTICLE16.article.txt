Columnisfs public crih'cism of government
wouldn't fly under Taliban regime
I would like to thank Josh Kallman
for writing the incisive and valiant
guest column which appeared in yes
terday's Daily ("America ignores its
own Taliban").
Whether or not all of us agree with
his conclusion that "the apparent dis
similarities between the U.S. govern
ment and the Taliban are superficial at
best," we must acknowledge the pro
found bravery displayed by Kallman —
who, despite this belief, still had the
courage to put his name to an article so
intensely critical of the U.S. govern
ment. By so doing, Kallman surely
must expect imminent punishment
that is at least as brutal and "pervasive,
albeit more abstruse," than what an
enemy of the Taliban regime might
have expected before the United States
so unjustly obliterated it.
For Kallman, who so nobly stands as
our palladium of justice against "CNN,
corporate industry and the religious
right," his defiance of this tyrannical
system must surely result in — if not his
death, torture, or the murder of his
family — some retribution "more insid
ious because it is so subtle."
I expect that very shortly Kallman's
name will be blacklisted. He will be qui
etly expelled from this prestigious uni
versity, he will have access only to the
most menial and humiliating of jobs,
those in authority will avoid him as they
would a leper and, in general, every av
enue by which he might aspire to such
"illusions" as life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness will be "subtly" yet
categorically closed to him.
Indeed, we should all take a moment
to recognize and applaud — if only sur
reptitiously in our terrified, oppressed
hearts — the courage evinced in Kall
man. With a resplendent heroism com
parable even to that of Vaclav Havel,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or that one
brave Chinese student who on June 4,
1989 stood before a tank in Tiananmen
Square, Kallman truly brings hope to
all of us.

Hypocrisy pervades U.S.
foreign policy
At least Josh Kallman was partially
right.
His March 5 article, "America is not
honest about its own Taliban," may
completely miss the mark with United
States hypocrisy on its domestic policy.
Unfortunately, however, the hypocrisy
does exist — it just inhabits American
foreign policy instead.
To illustrate, let's have a hypotheti
cal foreign-policy pop quiz with Presi

dent George W. Bush.
What would our administration call
a country that produces the highest lev
els of chemical pollution in the world
but forsakes key negotiations for stem
ming global warming? How about a na
tion that refused to ratify a landmark
nuclear test ban treaty designed to pre
serve the future from nuclear disaster?
And what about a government that
drops out of talks to enforce a biologi
cal weapons treaty because it refuses to
let international inspectors peek at its
weapons of mass destruction? What if
this were the same country that refused
to sign a convention banning anti-per
sonnel land mines, which have killed
and maimed many hundreds of thou
sands of civilians in the past several
decades, to protect its own military?
He'd probably start by ranting on
and on about a "rogue state" that was
part of an "axis of evil." Then, after a
long diatribe about the need for
democracy to triumph over dictator
ship, and for freedom to win over
tyranny, and for good to defeat evil,
he'd conclude his answer with "Iraq,
Iran, North Korea or all of the above."
Sadly for the guy who didn't know
the names of the heads of states for
India, Pakistan, Chechnya and Taiwan
two years ago, he doesn't realize that
the real answer is "USA." ( Then again,
he might still be right about the "rogue
state" comment).
And even more sadly, the vast ma
jority of Americans, even intelligent
ones here at Stanford, would have
failed that pop quiz too.
We condemn Iran for supplying
weapons to Palestinians while the
largest chunk of American "foreign
aid" sponsors the American-made M-l
Abrams tanks and Black Hawk heli
copters that we see slaughtering Pales
tinian boys by the bushel on CNN.
We blame China for human rights
violations even though only two coun
tries — Somalia and the United States
— have refused to sign the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. For this, the
disgusted international community
kicked us off the UN Human Rights
Commission.
We call for international coopera
tion for fighting terrorism, but the
United States was only one of seven
countries to vote against the creation of
an International Criminal Court be
cause we feared our military could be
subject to war-crimes prosecution out
side the American justice system.
We decry the brutality of the Tal
iban atrocities, but we try to deny basic
prisoner-of-war rights established by
the Geneva Convention in the cases of
Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers so we
can interrogate and torture them like
a two-bit dictatorship.
Is this our moral high ground? If we
are so keen about talking the talk, why
can't we walk the walk, too?
And you know what? If I were a bit

ter, unemployed, young Saudi student
living in stark poverty amid the gratu
itous luxury of the corrupt Saudi royal
family backed by American oil inter
ests, I might have turned to fundamen
talist Islam to find new meaning in my
life. And if the fundamentalist clerics
who I respected explained to me how
American weapons were massacring
my Arab brothers in Palestine and how
American oil interests were lobbying to
prop up the corrupt Saudi royal family
and how American troops were occupy
ing Saudi Arabia itself, I might have de
cided to bomb some American build
ings too. Hopefully, I wouldn't have
done so, but I cannot rule out that trag
ic possibility.
By no means am I condoning any
kind of international terrorism. In fact,
1 believe wholeheartedly in hunting
down the criminals who slaughter in
nocents so unjustly. On the other hand,
the sad truth is that much of the world
views us as heartless imperialists who
wouldn't lift a finger to save millions
upon millions of Africans in civil war
yet would sacrifice the lives of millions
of Iraqi women and children through
economic sanctions designed to pre
serve American oil security in the Per
sian Gulf.
Until we erase that perception with
hard actions, not mere words, expect
Sept. 1 1 to be the first of many acts of
terrorism against the United States.

Complete gender equality glorifies
neither men nor women
Jen Wekselbaum asked in her col
umn on Monday ("Have a ball tearing
down outdated gender barriers")
whether the elegant Viennese Ball was
really so far away from the bumps and
grinds of your garden-variety club,
where bodies writhe to crude beats ac
companied by even cruder lyrics.
Certainly, sex roles are highly differ
entiated in both. But here is the differ
ence — at the Viennese ball, women
are treated reverently by their male
partners with the attentive, (God for
bid) "chivalrous" decorum that men
are expected to display. At the club,
women are pieces of meat — hence the
lack of clothing. One cannot really
speak of "sex roles" in the club when
one of the sexes is sub-human and thus
sub-sex role, where she is merely a
compilation of smooth curves of flesh.
Rousseau, that great philosopher of
eros, once remarked that the more
women behave like men, the less men
will respect them. Feminism and the
sexual revolution have shown them
selves to be the great androcentric,
unerotic projects of contemporary
