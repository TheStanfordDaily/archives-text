has proven to be a streak of de
manding matches when it heads
south to face UC-San Diego (3-13,
1-11) tonight.

be minimal competition for the
Cardinal, but as the NCAA Tour
nament approaches, every confer
ence match matters. Even this one.
A maximum of two teams from
the MPSF will qualify for the tour
nament, and as 10 of the top 15
teams belong to the MPSF, qualify
ing for the tournament is a victory
in itself.
"The goal of winning the Na
tional Championship is definitely

in the back of our minds, and in
our case, it's a realistic goal," said
coach Don Shaw.
Recent performances have re
vealed potential for the Stanford
squad to capture a spot.
" This year is one of our best
shots at winning the whole tiling,"
said junior opposite Curt Toppel.
The Cardinal recently rebound
ed from a five-game losing streak
when it split matches with two top
ranked teams.
Stanford upset then-No. 1
UCLA (14-3,9-2) on Feb. 16th, and
then, the following weekend, lost in
a five-game showdown against Pep
perdine (13-4, 8-2), who took over
the nation's top ranking.
Stanford finished off the week
end by shutting out USC (2-10, 5-
13), marking the end of a four
game homestead.
On Saturday, the Cardinal faced
No. 10 Long Beach (7-9, 5-5) and
clinched another conference win in
a live-game offensive showdown.
The victory was the result of
good timing and luck. Despite
being out-hit .370 to .367 and out
blocked 14-9 by the 49ers, the five
game showdown ended in the Car
dinal's favor, 30-27, 26-30, 26-30,
30-28, 15-11.
Taking advantage of every op
portunity and consistently deliv
ering crucial points, Toppel pro
pelled the Cardinal squad. He
posted six blocks, a .365 hitting
clip, and a season and match-high
34 kills.

Kevin Hansen boosted the
team with 71 assists and junior
libero Seth Ring contributed 8
digs. Junior outside hitter Billy
Strikland also added to the Car
dinal offense, recording 14 kills
and 8 digs.
The Cardinal squad ventures to
San Diego tonight to face the Tri
tons, who until last week had not
won a conference match.
After suffering a streak of em
barrassing losses in the beginning
of the season, the Tritons pulled
off a surprise victory against
Long Beach State last week in a
four-game match that lasted over
two hours.

Junior middle blocker Paul Bocoge goes up for the hard spike in the Cardi
nal's loss to Pepperdine. Stanford hopes for more of the same this weekend
against UC-San Diego.
