# Gymnastics legend says farewell and leaves behind
## Lasting Impressions 
### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An old samurai, partly ob
scured from view, sits hunched as
he gazes upon the multitude of
warriors who stand at attention
before him.
His face now lined with the
subtle appearance of wrinkles,
his hair tinged with white, his
body a shadow of its former self,
the samurai still single-handedly
holds the awe of his pupils.
It was he who led them to their
most crushing losses and also to
their most inspiring victories.
It is he who they fight for.
And thirty years later, it is he
who will turn in his sword. For
Sadao Hamada, in some re
spects the men's-gymnastics ver
sion of Bela Karolyi, the time has
finally come.
The story of men's gymnastics
head coach Hamada's life is one
that includes the greatest tri

umphs, the hardest defeats, the
most reassuring technical bril
liance and at times a seeming dis
regard for team morale.
It is a story of a man who
brought the Cardinal its only
NCAA titles in gymnastics and a
man who came tantalizingly close
to coaching a gold medalist.
When he left in 1972, former
head coach Dan Millman recom
mended a young 24-year-old
Japanese gymnast who had just
graduated from Kent State with a
masters in physical education to
take his place.
Hamada began gymnastics in
high school after a knee condition
prevented him from playing vol
leyball. He placed second in the all
around competition in the AAU
gymnastics championships the
previous two years and finished
first on the sidehorse that same
year during the U.S. Oymnastics
Federation Championships.
"I wasn't sure what I was

doing [when I got to Stanford]. I
knew how to teach good gymnas
tics, but I didn't know much
about recruiting and the admin
istrative aspect of coaching,"
Hamada said.
Coaching a team that had
placed second in the Pac-8 the
year before, Hamada was able to
lead his gymnasts to several no
table milestones in the 19705.
Olympian Steve Hug won the
national all-around title three
times while fellow teammate Ted
Marcy was tops on the pommel
horse three times as well. Yet,
Hamada admits that while he was
an excellent individual coach he
had trouble bringing a team to
gether.
"I didn't have many team
goals early on and we had a
lack of scholarships at the
time. I was still learning to be
come a good head coach."

Stanford head coach Sadao Hamada will lead the men's gymnastics team into competition at Maples for the
final time on Saturday. The legendary coach will retire after 30 years at the end of this season.
