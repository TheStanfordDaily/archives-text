# Gymnastics legend says farewell and leaves behind
## Lasting Impressions 
### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An old samurai, partly ob
scured from view, sits hunched as
he gazes upon the multitude of
warriors who stand at attention
before him.
His face now lined with the
subtle appearance of wrinkles,
his hair tinged with white, his
body a shadow of its former self,
the samurai still single-handedly
holds the awe of his pupils.
It was he who led them to their
most crushing losses and also to
their most inspiring victories.
It is he who they fight for.
And thirty years later, it is he
who will turn in his sword. For
Sadao Hamada, in some re
spects the men's-gymnastics ver
sion of Bela Karolyi, the time has
finally come.
The story of men's gymnastics
head coach Hamada's life is one
that includes the greatest tri

umphs, the hardest defeats, the
most reassuring technical bril
liance and at times a seeming dis
regard for team morale.
It is a story of a man who
brought the Cardinal its only
NCAA titles in gymnastics and a
man who came tantalizingly close
to coaching a gold medalist.
When he left in 1972, former
head coach Dan Millman recom
mended a young 24-year-old
Japanese gymnast who had just
graduated from Kent State with a
masters in physical education to
take his place.
Hamada began gymnastics in
high school after a knee condition
prevented him from playing vol
leyball. He placed second in the all
around competition in the AAU
gymnastics championships the
previous two years and finished
first on the sidehorse that same
year during the U.S. Oymnastics
Federation Championships.
"I wasn't sure what I was

doing [when I got to Stanford]. I
knew how to teach good gymnas
tics, but I didn't know much
about recruiting and the admin
istrative aspect of coaching,"
Hamada said.
Coaching a team that had
placed second in the Pac-8 the
year before, Hamada was able to
lead his gymnasts to several no
table milestones in the 19705.
Olympian Steve Hug won the
national all-around title three
times while fellow teammate Ted
Marcy was tops on the pommel
horse three times as well. Yet,
Hamada admits that while he was
an excellent individual coach he
had trouble bringing a team to
gether.
"I didn't have many team
goals early on and we had a
lack of scholarships at the
time. I was still learning to be
come a good head coach."


NEMIL DALAL / The Stanford Daily
Stanford head coach Sadao Hamada will lead the men's gymnastics team into competition at Maples for the
final time on Saturday. The legendary coach will retire after 30 years at the end of this season.
Jon Louis, a gymnast during the
mid-80s at Stanford concurs,
"[Coach Hamada] seemed very
hesitant to enforce his opinions and
views when I was a gymnast. His
knowledge of gymnastics from a
technical standpoint was excellent,
but he had less strength in forming
a team."
"His command of English wasn't
great and he was a little shy with
American culture," Louis said.
"During my seasons, he began to
realize that great individuals come
from great teams."
During the early seasons,
Coach Hamada learned to lose
fairly quickly.
"Our typical record after I had
coached fora few years was 1-11. [1
began to learn J that you cannot be
afraid of losing, or you will never
learn how to win."
Starting in the late-80s, Hamada
discovered the magic formula. He
figured out how to build a team in a
sport of individuals. This culminat
ed in the underdog Cardinal win
ning NCAAs in 1992, as Jeff" Ben
der's "Bender Back" clinched Stan
ford gymnastics' first national title.
Hamada, who idealizes Oda
Nobunaga— a Japanese warrior
and master strategist of the 16th
Century — chalks up his coup

against Nebraska that year to his
strategy.
" 1992 was a masterpiece of a sea
son. I knew how the other coaches
were preparing but I was unpre
dictable to those guys."
Between 1992 and 1995, the
Cardinal won three national ti
tles, and finished once as nation
al runner-up.
During these seasons, Hamada
was also personally coaching Stan
ford gymnast Jair Lynch as he com
peted in both the summer
Olympics in Barcelona and Atlanta.
In 1996, Lynch won the silver
medal on the parallel bars. Ukrain
ian Rustam Sharipov barely edged
him out by twelve-thousandths of a
point.
"[A] personal goal [of mine] was
at the international level," Hamada
recounts. "I wanted to build an
Olympian. [I J had [an] Olympian in
'92. [My] next goal was, 1 want to
produce an Olympic gold medalist,
which we almost did in '96. After 1
looked at all the judges' sheets, I
knew if we had a neutral judging
panel [at the Olympics], Jair would
haVe won [gold]."
After three national champi
onships, and a silver medalist, the
men's gymnastics program faced a
period of slow but steady decay.
"I didn't recruit too well.
And probably 1 was somewhat
burned out after NCAAs and
two Olympics.
"Myself, I didn't have any

more goals, that was the major
thing. I was thinking of retiring
in '96, but I couldn't make that
kind of big decision."
A small light enters Hamada's
eyes as he recounts the travails that
the team has endured this year as
the Cardinal approaches its final
home meet against top-ranked Ok
lahoma this Saturday.
"This has been a very tough sea
son. Everything has to be perfect [to
win NCAAsJ. Next month is impor
tant, and we know what we have to
do. I don't want to win NGAAs for
myself, it's because my guys want it."
Speaking to his gymnasts, one
gets an inkling that Hamada's char
acter is far more complex than
meets the eye. To say that he is the
dignified head coach who has gra
ciously taught the team about gym
nastics would be an oversimplifica
tion of sorts.
Senior co-captain Rico Andrade
remembers "this one time" during
his sophomore season at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
championships.
"Coach Hamada asked the guys

to place bets on me of whether I
would hit my routine or not," he
says with <i trace of mock horror in
his voice. "Basically, the older guys
bet that 1 wouldn't make it, while
the younger guys bet for me."
"It doesn't take much to make
him laugh," Andrade said. "If he
plays a little joke on you, no matter
ilow small, he'll be telling everyone
for weeks."
"Nothing gets to him," An
drade added on a more serious
note, "fie just lives in the mo
ment. I le doesn't stress out, and
he uses that quality to critically
analyze what he needs to do to
accomplish something. It's real
ly interesting that he is so seri
ous about gymnastics, but that
he doesn't allow that serious
ness to take over his life."
Sophomore Dan Gill, an All-
American his freshman season, in
terjects, "Coach Hamada has had
us work harder than we have
worked in our entire lives. He's got
ten us to believe in ourselves."
As Coach Hamada, looks
around the Ford Center practice fa
cility fora minute, he pauses, as he
gets ready to leave.
"I've spent so many hours in this
gym. I think many years from now
when I close my eyes, I'll remember
this place."
And as the years pass, maybe
someday someone will remember
the wizened samurai that once held
the gym in his awe.
An old samurai, partly ob
scured from view, sits hunched as
he gazes upon the multitude of
warriors who stand at attention

His face now lined with the
subtle appearance of wrinkles,

His face now lined with the

It was he who led them to their

It is he who they fight for.
And thirty years later, it is he
who will turn in his sword. For
Sadao Hamada, in some re

finally come.
The story of men's gymnastics
head coach Hamada's life is one
that includes the greatest tri

umphs, the hardest defeats, the
most reassuring technical bril
liance and at times a seeming dis
regard for team morale.
It is a story of a man who
brought the Cardinal its only
NCAA titles in gymnastics and a
man who came tantalizingly close
to coaching a gold medalist.
When he left in 1972, former
head coach Dan Millman recom
mended a young 24-year-old
Japanese gymnast who had just
graduated from Kent State with a
masters in physical education to
take his place.
Hamada began gymnastics in
high school after a knee condition
prevented him from playing vol
leyball. He placed second in the all
around competition in the AAU
gymnastics championships the
previous two years and finished
first on the sidehorse that same
year during the U.S. Oymnastics
Federation Championships.
"I wasn't sure what I was

doing [when I got to Stanford]. I
knew how to teach good gymnas
tics, but I didn't know much
about recruiting and the admin
istrative aspect of coaching,"
Hamada said.
Coaching a team that had
placed second in the Pac-8 the
year before, Hamada was able to
lead his gymnasts to several no
table milestones in the 19705.
Olympian Steve Hug won the
national all-around title three
times while fellow teammate Ted
Marcy was tops on the pommel
horse three times as well. Yet,
Hamada admits that while he was
an excellent individual coach he
had trouble bringing a team to

"I didn't have many team
goals early on and we had a
lack of scholarships at the
time. I was still learning to be
come a good head coach."


NEMIL DALAL / The Stanford Daily
Stanford head coach Sadao Hamada will lead the men's gymnastics team into competition at Maples for the
final time on Saturday. The legendary coach will retire after 30 years at the end of this season.
Jon Louis, a gymnast during the
mid-80s at Stanford concurs,
"[Coach Hamada] seemed very
hesitant to enforce his opinions and
views when I was a gymnast. His
knowledge of gymnastics from a
technical standpoint was excellent,
but he had less strength in forming
a team."
"His command of English wasn't
great and he was a little shy with
American culture," Louis said.
"During my seasons, he began to
realize that great individuals come
from great teams."
During the early seasons,
Coach Hamada learned to lose
fairly quickly.
"Our typical record after I had
coached fora few years was 1-11. [1
began to learn J that you cannot be
afraid of losing, or you will never
learn how to win."
Starting in the late-80s, Hamada
discovered the magic formula. He
figured out how to build a team in a
sport of individuals. This culminat
ed in the underdog Cardinal win
ning NCAAs in 1992, as Jeff" Ben
der's "Bender Back" clinched Stan
ford gymnastics' first national title.
Hamada, who idealizes Oda
Nobunaga— a Japanese warrior
and master strategist of the 16th
Century — chalks up his coup

against Nebraska that year to his
strategy.
" 1992 was a masterpiece of a sea

Between 1992 and 1995, the
Cardinal won three national ti

During these seasons, Hamada
was also personally coaching Stan
ford gymnast Jair Lynch as he com
peted in both the summer
Olympics in Barcelona and Atlanta.
In 1996, Lynch won the silver
medal on the parallel bars. Ukrain
ian Rustam Sharipov barely edged
him out by twelve-thousandths of a
point.
"[A] personal goal [of mine] was
at the international level," Hamada
recounts. "I wanted to build an
Olympian. [I J had [an] Olympian in
'92. [My] next goal was, 1 want to
produce an Olympic gold medalist,
which we almost did in '96. After 1
looked at all the judges' sheets, I
knew if we had a neutral judging
panel [at the Olympics], Jair would
haVe won [gold]."
After three national champi
onships, and a silver medalist, the
men's gymnastics program faced a
period of slow but steady decay.
"I didn't recruit too well.
And probably 1 was somewhat
burned out after NCAAs and

thing. I was thinking of retiring

A small light enters Hamada's
eyes as he recounts the travails that
the team has endured this year as
the Cardinal approaches its final
home meet against top-ranked Ok
lahoma this Saturday.
"This has been a very tough sea
son. Everything has to be perfect [to

myself, it's because my guys want it."
Speaking to his gymnasts, one

"[A] personal goal [of mine] was
at the international level," Hamada
recounts. "I wanted to build an
Olympian. [I J had [an] Olympian in
'92. [My] next goal was, 1 want to
produce an Olympic gold medalist,
which we almost did in '96. After 1
looked at all the judges' sheets, I
knew if we had a neutral judging
panel [at the Olympics], Jair would
haVe won [gold]."
After three national champi
onships, and a silver medalist, the
men's gymnastics program faced a
period of slow but steady decay.
"I didn't recruit too well.
And probably 1 was somewhat
burned out after NCAAs and
two Olympics.
"Myself, I didn't have any

more goals, that was the major
thing. I was thinking of retiring
in '96, but I couldn't make that
kind of big decision."
A small light enters Hamada's
eyes as he recounts the travails that
the team has endured this year as
the Cardinal approaches its final
home meet against top-ranked Ok
lahoma this Saturday.
"This has been a very tough sea
son. Everything has to be perfect [to
win NCAAsJ. Next month is impor
tant, and we know what we have to
do. I don't want to win NGAAs for
myself, it's because my guys want it."
Speaking to his gymnasts, one
gets an inkling that Hamada's char
acter is far more complex than
meets the eye. To say that he is the
dignified head coach who has gra
ciously taught the team about gym
nastics would be an oversimplifica
tion of sorts.
Senior co-captain Rico Andrade
remembers "this one time" during
his sophomore season at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
championships.
"Coach Hamada asked the guys

to place bets on me of whether I
would hit my routine or not," he
says with <i trace of mock horror in
his voice. "Basically, the older guys
bet that 1 wouldn't make it, while
the younger guys bet for me."
"It doesn't take much to make
him laugh," Andrade said. "If he
plays a little joke on you, no matter
ilow small, he'll be telling everyone
for weeks."
"Nothing gets to him," An
drade added on a more serious
note, "fie just lives in the mo
ment. I le doesn't stress out, and
he uses that quality to critically
analyze what he needs to do to
accomplish something. It's real
ly interesting that he is so seri
ous about gymnastics, but that
he doesn't allow that serious
ness to take over his life."
Sophomore Dan Gill, an All-
American his freshman season, in
terjects, "Coach Hamada has had
us work harder than we have
worked in our entire lives. He's got
ten us to believe in ourselves."
As Coach Hamada, looks
around the Ford Center practice fa
cility fora minute, he pauses, as he
gets ready to leave.
"I've spent so many hours in this
gym. I think many years from now
when I close my eyes, I'll remember
this place."
And as the years pass, maybe
someday someone will remember
the wizened samurai that once held
the gym in his awe.
