# Rites of Spring Return
## 
### 
If you'r • like me, then for the last two
wee' „ you've been dreaming of cacti
and grapefruit, checking box scores
lor meaningless exhibition games
and agonizing over every sore muscle and
hangnail reported at your favorite major
league team's spring training site.
Call me obsessed, call me simple-mind
ed, call me.. . actually, let's stop there, hi
ther way, the most beautiful tour words of
the year have arrived; "Pitchers and catch
ers report." (Okay, I'm sure we all can
think of four better words that may or may
not involve Anna Kournikova, but just go

with me here.)
While baseball season
on this campus began
more than a month ago,
the arrival of the profes
sional game each year al
ways puts a hop in my step.
Maybe it's because I actual
ly can rationalize my Cubs'
chance to win the World
Series. Maybe it's because

we can lalk about baseball again without
mentioning the phrase "impending labor
battle." And maybe it's because WGN adds
Cubs baseball to its already stellar lineup of
(lassie "MacGyver" reruns and riveting
episodes of "Elimidate."
Hie lx)ttom line is that spring training in
spires me. I get Sammy Sosa yelling, "Gcxxl
morning America, I am back in the house!" I
gel Peter (iammons on HSPN.com twice a
week. And 1 get a number of absorbing story
lines, all of which are written about so exten
sively that 1 approach the required number of
hours in front of my computer to trigger an
aneurysm.
For example, now we all have another
reason to hate the "Damn Yankees." In a
plot somewhat resembling the Broadway
play, Jason (iiambi sold his soul (not to men
tion his goatee) to the Devil-or George
Steinbrenner, if you prefer-in exchange for
Yankee pinstripes.
I le promptly went from a blue-col

lar, exciting and brash young star on the A's
to a Yankees cover boy. Now we see him hug
ging the Boss, stroking Joe Torre's ego and
turning his back on everything he claimed to
represent while on the West Coast.
for most of the country, Giambi's " Fredo,
you're dead to me" moment has arrived.
Hie silver lining here? Any reason that al
lows you to hate the Yankees even more
than you already do is a g<x>d one.
In another intriguing MLB subplot,
we've discovered that the harsh Caribbean
sun can take its toll on the aging process.
While U.S. embassies in Latin American
countries cracked down on official docu
mentation for work visa approvals, at least
20 Major Leaguers "aged" several years in
the off-season.
Authorities found that their actual birth
days didn't match the later dates they had
originally reported in order to boost their
potential values as young prospects.
In some ways, it's like telling your friends
that the fake I.I), you've been using fort hree
years is actually you.
Now, I had a housekeeper years ago that
liked to claim she was pushing 40 when in
fact she'd been around the last time the Cubs
won the World Series (in 1908); I have a
grandmother that has celebrated 10 birth
days in the past 10 years but has added zero
years to her "age."
So why is this any different? Maybe it's
not. On the surface, a young phenom is still
a young phenom whether he's 21 or 23, and
a player still putting up numbers in his 30s is
doing so regardless of a one- or two-year dif
ference in his age.
But some teams make personnel deci
sions based heavily on age in addition to per
formance and "wear and tear," so several big
leaguers may not receive the same contracts
that they would have as younger versions of
themselves.
Regardless of who gave up facial hair
(and his manhood) or which stars are accel-


Brett Kaufman
erating our notions of time, the
beautiful truth is that spring is here,
with Opening Day just around the
corner. And that—along with
bunches of extra birthday cakes—is
a wonderful reason to celebrate.

For example, now we all have another
reason to hate the "Damn Yankees." In a
plot somewhat resembling the Broadway
play, Jason (iiambi sold his soul (not to men
tion his goatee) to the Devil-or George
Steinbrenner, if you prefer-in exchange for
Yankee pinstripes.
I le promptly went from a blue-col

lar, exciting and brash young star on the A's
to a Yankees cover boy. Now we see him hug
ging the Boss, stroking Joe Torre's ego and
turning his back on everything he claimed to
represent while on the West Coast.
for most of the country, Giambi's " Fredo,
you're dead to me" moment has arrived.
Hie silver lining here? Any reason that al
lows you to hate the Yankees even more
than you already do is a g<x>d one.
In another intriguing MLB subplot,
we've discovered that the harsh Caribbean
sun can take its toll on the aging process.
While U.S. embassies in Latin American
countries cracked down on official docu
mentation for work visa approvals, at least
20 Major Leaguers "aged" several years in
the off-season.
Authorities found that their actual birth
days didn't match the later dates they had
originally reported in order to boost their
potential values as young prospects.
In some ways, it's like telling your friends
that the fake I.I), you've been using fort hree
years is actually you.
Now, I had a housekeeper years ago that
liked to claim she was pushing 40 when in
fact she'd been around the last time the Cubs
won the World Series (in 1908); I have a
grandmother that has celebrated 10 birth
days in the past 10 years but has added zero
years to her "age."
So why is this any different? Maybe it's
not. On the surface, a young phenom is still
a young phenom whether he's 21 or 23, and
a player still putting up numbers in his 30s is
doing so regardless of a one- or two-year dif
ference in his age.
But some teams make personnel deci
sions based heavily on age in addition to per
formance and "wear and tear," so several big
leaguers may not receive the same contracts
that they would have as younger versions of
themselves.
Regardless of who gave up facial hair
(and his manhood) or which stars are accel-

beautiful truth is that spring is here,
with Opening Day just around the
corner. And that—along with
bunches of extra birthday cakes—is
a wonderful reason to celebrate.
