# Card tandem comes up one game short
## Men's doubles teams play well but walk away without a prize 
### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Perhaps the men's tennis team's
biggest challenge of the weekend was
not against any opponent but against
the temptation to hit the sandy beaches
and the towering surf.
Spring Break started a little early
for the men's tennis team this year as
three duos representing the Cardi
nal headed down to La Jolla for the
annual Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
Tennis Championships.
Stanford's tandem of David Martin
and Scott Lipsky were seeded third col
legiate in the tournament, while the
pair of Ryan Haviland and K.J. Hip
pensteel was fourth collegiate.
The freshman duo of Sam War
burg and Phil Sheng entered the
tournament unseeded.
The Pacific Coast Doubles format
is a welcome change of pace for the
Cardinal squad.
Unlike a dual-meet or an ITA /
NCAA sponsored tournament, the
championships are a doubles-exclu
sive, 64-team competition that has
two sets of seeded teams.
Sixteen total teams — eight colle
giate and eight open—are seeded
throughout a draw that includes a
field of everyone from high-school
kids to retirees.
"It's a nice tournament to play be
cause it's lower key," said Lipsky.
"There's not so much pressure and we
know that our game is not going to de
cide a match."
"It's a valuable time to just concen
trate on doubles work," added head
coach Dick Gould.

Junior Ryan Haviland hits the ball with a little added flare. He and his doubles partner,
freshman Phil Seng, were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Pacific Coast Men's Dou
bles Tournament on Sunday.
