# Card tandem comes up one game short
## Men's doubles teams play well but walk away without a prize 
### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Perhaps the men's tennis team's
biggest challenge of the weekend was
not against any opponent but against
the temptation to hit the sandy beaches
and the towering surf.
Spring Break started a little early
for the men's tennis team this year as
three duos representing the Cardi
nal headed down to La Jolla for the
annual Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
Tennis Championships.
Stanford's tandem of David Martin
and Scott Lipsky were seeded third col
legiate in the tournament, while the
pair of Ryan Haviland and K.J. Hip
pensteel was fourth collegiate.
The freshman duo of Sam War
burg and Phil Sheng entered the
tournament unseeded.
The Pacific Coast Doubles format
is a welcome change of pace for the
Cardinal squad.
Unlike a dual-meet or an ITA /
NCAA sponsored tournament, the
championships are a doubles-exclu
sive, 64-team competition that has
two sets of seeded teams.
Sixteen total teams — eight colle
giate and eight open—are seeded
throughout a draw that includes a
field of everyone from high-school
kids to retirees.
"It's a nice tournament to play be
cause it's lower key," said Lipsky.
"There's not so much pressure and we
know that our game is not going to de
cide a match."
"It's a valuable time to just concen
trate on doubles work," added head
coach Dick Gould.

Junior Ryan Haviland hits the ball with a little added flare. He and his doubles partner,
freshman Phil Seng, were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Pacific Coast Men's Dou
bles Tournament on Sunday.
The Cardinal breezed through
Friday's first and second rounds
with six consecutive victories. The
first round saw the three Stanford
teams drop only 11 games in
three straight-set victories.
The second round, played
later in the day, would prove to be
more exciting.
Lipsky / Martin had faced a
surprisingly tough unseeded op
ponent that forced the top Stan
ford doubles team to fight fora
third set victory, while Warburg /
Sheng passed their first real test
by upsetting No. 6 collegiate
seeds Juan Cerda and Jason
Pongsrikul of UC-San Diego in
three sets, 7-5,4-6, 6-2.
Saturday brought two more
rounds of doubles action.
In a close repeat of Friday's
matches, Lipsky/Martin once
again survived a hard fought
three setter, 3-, 6-3, 6-3, while
Warburg / Sheng, on a roll de
feated the No. 2 open Piet
Aid rich and Jose Ruelos of La
Jolla in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2.
In the second match in as
many days, Haviland and Hip
pensteel posted a 6-4, 6-3 margin
of victory.
"I was really pleased at the
progress of the team," said Gould.
"Everybody did a nice job of get
ting to the quarters."
Warburg / Sheng, already hav
ing made an impressive run, fi
nally succumbed to the No. 2 col
legiates Ryan Moor and Nicholas
Rainy of USC, 7-5, 6-1, while
Haviland / Hippensteel fell in a
close match to Johan Berg, a Pep
perdine freshman, and Peter
Smith, the Pepperdine head
coach, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2.
Lipsky / Martin, the only sur
viving Stanford team, charged
on to the semifinals, outplaying
No. 5 collegiate Sebastian Gra
eff and Stefan Suter from Pep
perdine.

"I think. Phil [Sheng] and Sam
[Warburg] showed their best dou
bles game of the year," said
Gould. " They showed tremen
dous improvement in getting to
the quarters."
Lipsky and Martin, who man
aged to reach the third round of
the tournament last year, eagerly
looked forward fora chance to
play for the championship game
on Sunday.
"Another year definitely made
a difference," said Lipsky. "Dave
[Martin] and 1 got a lot better this
year, and of course, they key is
being more experienced."
Sunday's semifinal match pit
ted Lipsky / Martin against the
surprise unseeded team of Tiege
Sullivan and Ruben Torres of
USC. After topping the Trojans 7-
6(2) in the first-set tiebreak, the
Stanford duo easily captured the
second set 6-3.
The stage was set for the
Championship's final matchup of
the 3rd-seeded Cardinal and the
2nd-collegiate Trojans Moor and
Rainy, who had lost in the finals of
last years tournament to a UCLA
pair.
Despite being up a break early
in the first set, Lipsky / Martin
were not able to hang on to the
lead and fell, 6-3, 6-4.
Top collegiate seeds Marcin
Matkoski, one of last year's cham
pions, and J. Julien Rojer of
UCLA were eliminated in the 3rd
round by an unseeded team.

Lipsky / Martin, the only sur
viving Stanford team, charged
on to the semifinals, outplaying
No. 5 collegiate Sebastian Gra
eff and Stefan Suter from Pep
perdine.

"I think. Phil [Sheng] and Sam
[Warburg] showed their best dou
bles game of the year," said
Gould. " They showed tremen
dous improvement in getting to
the quarters."
Lipsky and Martin, who man
aged to reach the third round of
the tournament last year, eagerly
looked forward fora chance to
play for the championship game
on Sunday.
"Another year definitely made
a difference," said Lipsky. "Dave
[Martin] and 1 got a lot better this
year, and of course, they key is
being more experienced."
Sunday's semifinal match pit
ted Lipsky / Martin against the
surprise unseeded team of Tiege
Sullivan and Ruben Torres of
USC. After topping the Trojans 7-
6(2) in the first-set tiebreak, the
Stanford duo easily captured the
second set 6-3.
The stage was set for the
Championship's final matchup of
the 3rd-seeded Cardinal and the
2nd-collegiate Trojans Moor and
Rainy, who had lost in the finals of
last years tournament to a UCLA
pair.
Despite being up a break early
in the first set, Lipsky / Martin
were not able to hang on to the
lead and fell, 6-3, 6-4.

This year's tournament marks
the 113 th year of the Pacific Coast
Doubles.
A historic tournament, the
Championships traces its incep
tion back to 1890, making it the
longest-running tournament on
the West Coast. La Jolla Beach
and Tennis Club, opened 1927
and now firmly established as one
of California's best tennis resorts,
has been hosting the tournament
since 1942.
Stanford's next faces Ari
zona and Arizona State on Fri
day and Saturday at Taube
Tennis Center.
Perhaps the men's tennis team's
biggest challenge of the weekend was
not against any opponent but against
the temptation to hit the sandy beaches
and the towering surf.
Spring Break started a little early
for the men's tennis team this year as
three duos representing the Cardi
nal headed down to La Jolla for the
annual Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
Tennis Championships.
Stanford's tandem of David Martin
and Scott Lipsky were seeded third col
legiate in the tournament, while the
pair of Ryan Haviland and K.J. Hip
pensteel was fourth collegiate.
The freshman duo of Sam War
burg and Phil Sheng entered the
tournament unseeded.
The Pacific Coast Doubles format
is a welcome change of pace for the
Cardinal squad.
Unlike a dual-meet or an ITA /
NCAA sponsored tournament, the
championships are a doubles-exclu
sive, 64-team competition that has
two sets of seeded teams.
Sixteen total teams — eight colle
giate and eight open—are seeded
throughout a draw that includes a
field of everyone from high-school
kids to retirees.
"It's a nice tournament to play be
cause it's lower key," said Lipsky.
"There's not so much pressure and we
know that our game is not going to de
cide a match."
"It's a valuable time to just concen
trate on doubles work," added head
coach Dick Gould.

freshman Phil Seng, were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Pacific Coast Men's Dou
bles Tournament on Sunday.
The Cardinal breezed through
Friday's first and second rounds
with six consecutive victories. The
first round saw the three Stanford
teams drop only 11 games in
three straight-set victories.
The second round, played
later in the day, would prove to be
more exciting.
Lipsky / Martin had faced a
surprisingly tough unseeded op
ponent that forced the top Stan
ford doubles team to fight fora
third set victory, while Warburg /
Sheng passed their first real test
by upsetting No. 6 collegiate
seeds Juan Cerda and Jason
Pongsrikul of UC-San Diego in
three sets, 7-5,4-6, 6-2.
Saturday brought two more
rounds of doubles action.
In a close repeat of Friday's
matches, Lipsky/Martin once
again survived a hard fought
three setter, 3-, 6-3, 6-3, while
Warburg / Sheng, on a roll de
feated the No. 2 open Piet
Aid rich and Jose Ruelos of La
Jolla in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2.
In the second match in as
many days, Haviland and Hip
pensteel posted a 6-4, 6-3 margin
of victory.
"I was really pleased at the
progress of the team," said Gould.
"Everybody did a nice job of get
ting to the quarters."
Warburg / Sheng, already hav
ing made an impressive run, fi
nally succumbed to the No. 2 col
legiates Ryan Moor and Nicholas
Rainy of USC, 7-5, 6-1, while
Haviland / Hippensteel fell in a
close match to Johan Berg, a Pep

Smith, the Pepperdine head
coach, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2.
