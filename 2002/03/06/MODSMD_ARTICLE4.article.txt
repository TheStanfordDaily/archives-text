# Decision on housing coming soon

### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
University housing officials intend to meet
March 12 to discuss the status of next year's
housing situation. With the closing of Branner
Hall due to renovations, there will be a need for
more bed spaces, which would likely necessitate
a conversion of some doubles into triples.
Student Housing Services is in charge of this
renovation, part of an 18-year plan to renovate
and strengthen all residences, according to Todd
Benson, director of housing assignment services.
"We have an issue where Branner's offline,
so we have to come up with extra spaces," Ben
son said. "There are 183 freshmen normally as
signed to Branner, so we will have to find 183
spots in the system."
Undergraduate Housing Operations and its
staff are already preparing data and layouts of

rooms so that ofli
cials can decide
what to do. A total
of 150 spaces will
be added in Mir
rielees, but more
spaces must be
found. Rooms in
Row houses were

rumored to be the first to be converted.
"Our main goal is to identify inequities in the
[housing] system," said John Judicki, associate
director of Residential Education on the Row.
"There are many types of rooms that are looked
at. We're not just turning doubles into triples,
and we are looking at the entire system, not just
Row houses."
Judicki also talked about certain Row houses
that had larger rooms with non-conventional
shapes and sizes.

"Square footage-wise, there are many oddly
shaped rooms with vaulted ceilings in Row
houses," Judicki said. "While we watit to make
room for more people, we have to recognize
safety issues and also bathroom use.
"We don't want to impact the ability to use
the bathrooms. Also, particularly with Row
houses, there are issues around kitchen use and
occupancy seating in dining areas."
Benson said that one of housing's main con
cerns is the issue of common areas, lounge
spaces and study rooms.
"Over the last year with the housing crunch,
we've taken things like study areas and com
mon areas and we'd like to preserve those,"
Benson said. "We need those extra spaces and
we don't want to take away any more.
As for the amount of change, Benson assures
