### BRIAN COLLINS 
A Minnesota obstetrician who
served her residency at Stanford
Hospital was charged with the Feb.
24 murder of her 13-year-old son
and attempted murder of her for
mer husband.
The suspect, Donna M. Ander
son, lived with son, Stephen Burns,
in Shoreview, Minn., until a week be
fore his death, when the child trav
eled to stay with his father in
Burlingame, Calif.

Anderson allegedly left Min
nesota by car on Friday, Feb. 22.
and stopped in Kansas City, where
she boarded a plane to San Francis
co. After spending Saturday night
in a Burlingame hotel, she alleged
ly purchased a seven-inch knife at a
local grocery store and went to the
home of her ex-husband, Frank
Burns, Jr. After 15 minutes of con
versation with Burns, Anderson al
legedly stood up and went to her
son's room. Upon hearing a
scream, Burns rushed to subdue
Anderson, and was allegedly
stabbed in the leg. Burns' parents
called the police, who immediately
arrested Anderson.
Anderson received her medical
degree from George Washington

University School of Medicine in
1982. She worked in Jackson, Miss,
before moving to California fora
residency in the Department of
()bstetrics and Gynecology at Stan
ford Medical Center from July
1985 to June 1986.
Michelle Brandt, spokesperson
for the Medical Center, said that the
center had not been able to find any
one who remembered Anderson.
"She was-here a while ago, and
some people have asked if some
people [remember her]," Brandt
said. "All we found [were the dates]
when she was here."
Burns, a seventh grader, was
described as a "bright" child who
enjoyed playing basketball, base
ball and the French horn. Investi

gators have tried to piece together
the details of Burns' relationship
with his mother.
San Mateo County Chief In
spector Mike Dirickson said that
Anderson was a workaholic who
had little time and high expecta
tions for her son, who was cared for
by a nanny. In the two years before
his death, Stephen had visited a
counselor nine times.
Many friends and neighbors said
that Anderson was a hard-working
doctor and was well-respected by
colleagues. One former co-worker,
Dr. Robert Hildebrandt, was con
cerned about her mental health,
but nevertheless felt that she was
very dedicated to her son.
" The story is the same no matter
whom we talk to," Dirickson said.
"Ifyon knew her fora short period
of time, yon thought she was won
derful. If you really got to know
her though, you could see that
something was wrong."
Anderson was charged in San
Mateo County Superior Court on
February 26. A plea has not been
entered, but in the midst of a hear
ing to review media access to the
court proceedings, Anderson
spontaneously said, "I plead guilty
to the charges."
Judge Stephen Hall ignored An
derson's outburst and ordered that
criminal proceedings be delayed
until a mental competency evalua
tion is performed on Anderson.
