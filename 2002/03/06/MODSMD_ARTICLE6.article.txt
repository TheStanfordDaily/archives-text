# Many ages gather at Bing
## Nursery school gives students an opportunity for research while providing quality care

While most Stanford c lasses do not involve
finger painting and nap time, a few select stu
dents are moving toward graduation by
going back to the campus preschool.
Stanford's Bing Nursery School doubles
as a research area for students and profes
sors to study child development. Classes at
Bing allow students to learn about child
psychology and behavior through first
hand observation.
Freshman Emily Wood said that she learns
more from her hour-and-a-half of observa
tion each week than from lectures. "Basically,
it's just a really cool opportunity," Wood said.
Bing is used for seven different classes
throughout the year. Each of these includes
an observational or participation component.
"The opportunity to link theory to actual
children results in bringing [theoretical] un
derstanding to life," said Beverley Hartman,
assistant director of Bing and a lecturer in the
Department of Psychology.
Sophomore Cristina Mercado agreed.
"Observation teaches you to be an observ
er of anything because you are looking at the

simplest form of a person," Mercado said.
"You have to learn to look at what may seem
insignificant."
Although students in the classes are usually
undergraduates, sometimes graduate stu
dents from the School of Education or the
Graduate School of Business enroll as well.
I hey use t he class as a way to learn more about
children for when they start their own families.
Many students are also involved at Bing as
assistants to faculty researchers.
Besides the benefits it offers to preschool
children and Stanford students, Bing pro
vides a valuable place for faculty to conduct
research.
The idea of a research nursery school is
not unusual, and many major universities —
including Columbia, Vassar, UCLA and the
University of Chicago — have one.
Eve Clark, a professor of linguistics and
symbolic systems, frequently conducts stud
ies at Bing. She said her main focus is lan
guage acquisition in young children and how
young children attach meaning to words.
Clark and other researchers use "game
rooms" at the school to conduct their re
search. Researchers take children out of their
classrooms and perform various experi
ments in the form of games, which involve
teaching children new things or asking ques
tions and observing responses.
