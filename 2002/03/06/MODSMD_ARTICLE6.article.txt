# Many ages gather at Bing
## Nursery school gives students an opportunity for research while providing quality care 
### AMELIA DELAPAZ 
While most Stanford c lasses do not involve
finger painting and nap time, a few select stu
dents are moving toward graduation by
going back to the campus preschool.
Stanford's Bing Nursery School doubles
as a research area for students and profes
sors to study child development. Classes at
Bing allow students to learn about child
psychology and behavior through first
hand observation.
Freshman Emily Wood said that she learns
more from her hour-and-a-half of observa
tion each week than from lectures. "Basically,
it's just a really cool opportunity," Wood said.
Bing is used for seven different classes
throughout the year. Each of these includes
an observational or participation component.
"The opportunity to link theory to actual
children results in bringing [theoretical] un
derstanding to life," said Beverley Hartman,
assistant director of Bing and a lecturer in the
Department of Psychology.
Sophomore Cristina Mercado agreed.
"Observation teaches you to be an observ
er of anything because you are looking at the

simplest form of a person," Mercado said.
"You have to learn to look at what may seem
insignificant."
Although students in the classes are usually
undergraduates, sometimes graduate stu
dents from the School of Education or the
Graduate School of Business enroll as well.
I hey use t he class as a way to learn more about
children for when they start their own families.
Many students are also involved at Bing as
assistants to faculty researchers.
Besides the benefits it offers to preschool
children and Stanford students, Bing pro
vides a valuable place for faculty to conduct
research.
The idea of a research nursery school is
not unusual, and many major universities —
including Columbia, Vassar, UCLA and the
University of Chicago — have one.
Eve Clark, a professor of linguistics and
symbolic systems, frequently conducts stud
ies at Bing. She said her main focus is lan
guage acquisition in young children and how
young children attach meaning to words.
Clark and other researchers use "game
rooms" at the school to conduct their re
search. Researchers take children out of their
classrooms and perform various experi
ments in the form of games, which involve
teaching children new things or asking ques
tions and observing responses.

Two children play in the Bing Nursery School play
ground. The school was chosen as the best nursery
school in the nation by Child Magazine in 1993.
Researchers also silently ob
serve children from within the
classroom or through one-way
mirrors.
"Bing, in particular, has ideal
resources for conducting re
search with preschool children,"
said Deanne Perez-Granados, an
assistant professor of psychologi
cal studies in education. "The re
search play rooms provide terrif
ic space for working with chil
dren one-on-one."
This one-on-one attention also
enhances the children's experi
ence. Jean Lepper, director of
Bing, explained that often chil
dren will specifically ask to be part
of a study.
According to Lepper, children
not only love being able to play
games, but they also like the indi
vidual attention that comes from
the one-on-one research setting.

" The parents and children are
wonderful to work with because
they are familiar with the research
that we do, and are usually eager to
help us by participating in our re
search," Perez-Granados said.
While Bing is an excellent re
source for faculty, it was not de
signed purely with researchers' in
terests in mind.
Located on the southeast edge
of campus, the school was founded
35 years ago to "give back to the
children some of the things mod
ern living had taken away from
them," said Edith M. Dowley,
founding director of Bing.
Bing was meticulously planned
to give children the most well
rounded experience possible in
their interactions with surround
ings and peers. Each of the three
main classrooms has a half-acre
outdoor play area that was special
ly designed to enhance the devel
opment of the children — intellec
tually, socially and emotionally.
Each classroom has many differ
ent activities, including painting,

reading and working with clay. All
activities are designed to allow the
children to creatively express
themselves.
"We really just want to get them
to think," said Lepper.
Another aspect of Bing that
makes it unique is the high quality of
its teachers, according to Lepper.
Since teachers usually work at Bing
for several years, it has a strong foun
dation of experienced teachers.
All these factors contribute to
the immense popularity of the
school among parents. In fact,
Bing was chosen as the best nurs
ery school in the nation by Child
Magazine in 1993.
Unfortunately, Bing's popular
ity also makes fora long waiting
list. Because so many parents want
to enroll their children in Bing,
the University gives priority to
families of Stanford faculty. These
children make up about half of
Bing's student body, leaving only
a few coveted entrance opportuni
ties for children unaffiliated with
Stanford.

Two children play in the Bing Nursery School play
ground. The school was chosen as the best nursery
school in the nation by Child Magazine in 1993.
Researchers also silently ob
serve children from within the
classroom or through one-way
mirrors.
"Bing, in particular, has ideal
resources for conducting re
search with preschool children,"
said Deanne Perez-Granados, an
assistant professor of psychologi
cal studies in education. "The re
search play rooms provide terrif
ic space for working with chil
dren one-on-one."
This one-on-one attention also
enhances the children's experi
ence. Jean Lepper, director of
Bing, explained that often chil
dren will specifically ask to be part
of a study.
According to Lepper, children
not only love being able to play
games, but they also like the indi
vidual attention that comes from
the one-on-one research setting.

" The parents and children are
wonderful to work with because
they are familiar with the research
that we do, and are usually eager to
help us by participating in our re
search," Perez-Granados said.
While Bing is an excellent re
source for faculty, it was not de
signed purely with researchers' in
terests in mind.
Located on the southeast edge
of campus, the school was founded
35 years ago to "give back to the
children some of the things mod
ern living had taken away from
them," said Edith M. Dowley,
founding director of Bing.
Bing was meticulously planned
to give children the most well
rounded experience possible in
their interactions with surround
ings and peers. Each of the three
main classrooms has a half-acre
outdoor play area that was special
ly designed to enhance the devel
opment of the children — intellec
tually, socially and emotionally.
Each classroom has many differ
ent activities, including painting,

reading and working with clay. All
activities are designed to allow the
children to creatively express
themselves.
"We really just want to get them
to think," said Lepper.
Another aspect of Bing that
makes it unique is the high quality of
its teachers, according to Lepper.
Since teachers usually work at Bing
for several years, it has a strong foun
dation of experienced teachers.
All these factors contribute to
the immense popularity of the
school among parents. In fact,
Bing was chosen as the best nurs
ery school in the nation by Child
Magazine in 1993.
Unfortunately, Bing's popular
ity also makes fora long waiting
list. Because so many parents want
to enroll their children in Bing,
the University gives priority to
families of Stanford faculty. These
children make up about half of
Bing's student body, leaving only
a few coveted entrance opportuni
ties for children unaffiliated with
Stanford.
While most Stanford c lasses do not involve
finger painting and nap time, a few select stu
dents are moving toward graduation by
going back to the campus preschool.
Stanford's Bing Nursery School doubles
as a research area for students and profes
sors to study child development. Classes at
Bing allow students to learn about child
psychology and behavior through first
hand observation.
Freshman Emily Wood said that she learns
more from her hour-and-a-half of observa
tion each week than from lectures. "Basically,
it's just a really cool opportunity," Wood said.
Bing is used for seven different classes
throughout the year. Each of these includes
an observational or participation component.
"The opportunity to link theory to actual
children results in bringing [theoretical] un
derstanding to life," said Beverley Hartman,
assistant director of Bing and a lecturer in the
Department of Psychology.
Sophomore Cristina Mercado agreed.
"Observation teaches you to be an observ
er of anything because you are looking at the

simplest form of a person," Mercado said.
"You have to learn to look at what may seem
insignificant."
Although students in the classes are usually
undergraduates, sometimes graduate stu
dents from the School of Education or the
Graduate School of Business enroll as well.
I hey use t he class as a way to learn more about
children for when they start their own families.
Many students are also involved at Bing as
assistants to faculty researchers.
Besides the benefits it offers to preschool
children and Stanford students, Bing pro
vides a valuable place for faculty to conduct
research.
The idea of a research nursery school is
not unusual, and many major universities —
including Columbia, Vassar, UCLA and the
University of Chicago — have one.
Eve Clark, a professor of linguistics and
symbolic systems, frequently conducts stud
ies at Bing. She said her main focus is lan
guage acquisition in young children and how
young children attach meaning to words.
Clark and other researchers use "game
rooms" at the school to conduct their re
search. Researchers take children out of their
classrooms and perform various experi
ments in the form of games, which involve
teaching children new things or asking ques
tions and observing responses.
