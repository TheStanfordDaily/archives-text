## Pizzo claims that the hospital admits the more severely ill

A recent study conducted by
the California Off ice of Statewide
Health Planning and Develop
ment found an 1 I percent mortal
ity rale for heart attack patients
admitted to Stanford Hospital.

I his figure is below the 12.09 per
cent average overall mortality
rate for patients admitted to Cali
fornia hospitals.
Karen Rago, the hospital's vice
president tot program and services
line development, was optimistic
about the University's standing.
"[The rate is] a great place to
be for an academic center,"
Rago said.
The study examined the period
from 1996 to 1998, during which
128,509 heart-attack patients were
admitted to 398 California hospi

tills. Over 15,000 patients died with
in 30 clays of seeking treatment.
The Medical Center at UC-San
Francisco — formerly a partner
of the hospital — was among a
group of hospitals that ranked
above the statewide average,
while the majority of the Bay Area
Kaiser Permanente hospitals
ranked below the average. How
ever, of the 14 Northern Califor
nia centers rated "significantly
better than expected," nine were
Kaiser Permanente hospitals.
Two statistical models — clil

feting in the sets of risk adjust
ments used to account for the fact
that some hospitals admit sicker
patients than others — were em
ployed in the study. Both models
found Stanford Hospital at ap
proximately an I I percent risk
adjusted mortality rate.
"While comparisons • among
hospitals and care providers can
certainly be valuable, it is impor
tant to recognize the limitations of
such assessments," Medical School
Dean Philip Pizzo said. "For any
given disease category, it is not in
frequent that the more severely ill
patients—like those with heart
failure or those undergoing a sur
gical procedure — will be re
ferred to a tertiary center such as
Stanford, compared to being
treated at a community hospital."
Despite the fact that different
risk adjustments were used to nor
malize the level of patient sickness,
the statistical models employed
"[did] not necessarily reflect [the]
true differences in clinical care or
expertise," Pizzo said.
A representative at the UCSF
Medical Center agreed with
Pizzo's assessment.
"[The ratings use] coded ad
ministrative data that doesn't cap
ture the depth of the therapies
and drugs that we are able to
offer," Brigid Ide, director of per
formance improvement at UCSF,
told the San Francisco Chronicle.
Stanford Medical School Prof.
Larry Shuer, the hospital's chief of
staff , elaborated on the findings.
"Our concerns will be quite
similar to those expressed by
UCSF," Shuer said. "We know
that the data has serious flaws, and
that in part relates to the different
case mixes at different hospitals."
The report will be used to im
prove cardiac care at the hospital,
which, according to the hospital's
administrators, is among the na
tions leading treatment centers.
"We have a very aggressive ap
proach at Stanford for primary
angioplasty," Rago said. "We are
constantly looking at our process
es of care."
"[Stanford physicians] are
committed to serving the public
with the greatest degree of excel
lence they can provide," Pizzo
said. "Accordingly, Stanford
physicians will critically assess
outcome measures and work dili
gently to improve them."
