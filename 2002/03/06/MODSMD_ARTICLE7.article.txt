A recent study conducted by
the California Off ice of Statewide
Health Planning and Develop
ment found an 1 I percent mortal
ity rale for heart attack patients
admitted to Stanford Hospital.

I his figure is below the 12.09 per
cent average overall mortality
rate for patients admitted to Cali
fornia hospitals.
Karen Rago, the hospital's vice
president tot program and services
line development, was optimistic
about the University's standing.
"[The rate is] a great place to
be for an academic center,"
Rago said.
The study examined the period
from 1996 to 1998, during which
128,509 heart-attack patients were
admitted to 398 California hospi

tills. Over 15,000 patients died with
in 30 clays of seeking treatment.
The Medical Center at UC-San
Francisco — formerly a partner
of the hospital — was among a
group of hospitals that ranked
above the statewide average,
while the majority of the Bay Area
Kaiser Permanente hospitals
ranked below the average. How
ever, of the 14 Northern Califor
nia centers rated "significantly
better than expected," nine were
Kaiser Permanente hospitals.
Two statistical models — clil

feting in the sets of risk adjust
ments used to account for the fact
that some hospitals admit sicker
patients than others — were em
ployed in the study. Both models
found Stanford Hospital at ap
proximately an I I percent risk
adjusted mortality rate.
"While comparisons • among
hospitals and care providers can
certainly be valuable, it is impor

such assessments," Medical School
