# SLAC contributes to advancements
## Thanks to its location, center helps research

Located in Menlo Park and
supported by the U.S. Depart
ment of Energy, the National
Institutes of 1 lealth and the Na
tional Science Foundation, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center is one of the University's
most successful and famous re
search laboratories. Neil Calder,
director of SLAC's Office of

Co mm u nica
tions, estimates
that in addition
to a staff of over
1,400 faculty and

staff, close to 3,000 researchers
from more than 20 nations visit
the laboratory each year.
Senior Justin Vanden
hroucke, president of the Stan
ford Physics Society, said Stan
ford is "quite lucky to have
[SLAC]a few minutes from cam
pus— people at most universi
ties have to travel across the
country or the world to have ac
cess to such a facility."
Since its creation in 1962,
SLAC has focused primarily on
the field of particle physics, giv
ing researchers the opportuni
ty to generate unique experi
mental conditions that could
yield new insights into the na
ture of matter.
('.alder explained the nature
of SLAC's research.
"High-energy beams of sub
atomic particles collide with sta
tionary targets or with each
other," Calder said. " These col

lisions provide insights into the
behavior of matter and energy
at extremely liny distances or
under very violent conditions
that previously occurred only
during the 'Big Bang' birth of
the universe."
With a prestigious staff of
physicists, engineers and other
professionals, SLAC continues
to maintain its reputation for
excellence, according to
Calder.
"Physicists using its re
search facilities have won
three Nobel Prizes for discov-

eries of quarks
and an elemen
tary particle
called the 'tan
lepton,' which

are recognized today as fun
damental building blocks of
matter," Calder said.
Besides pioneering the ac
celeration and use of electron
beams in particle research,
('.alder said SLAC. has also par
ticipated in the fields of ad
vanced particle acceleration
techniques and high-power
klystrons — devices that gen
erate microwaves for accelerat
ing electrons.
According to Calder, kly
strons have powerful applica
tions in medical accelerators
used in cancer therapy, to which
SI AC lias contributed.
"The manufacture of medical
accelerators is now a billion-dol
lar industry," Calder said.
"Every day, about 100,000 peo
ple receive cancer treatment on
them in the United States
