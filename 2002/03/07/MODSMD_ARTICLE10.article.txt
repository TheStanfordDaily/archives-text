On March 7, 1986, The Daily printed an article
about the proliferation of VCRs on campus.
"Despite an ever-deepening public leeling of help
lessness in the face of new technology, one product lias
made quiet inroads into Stanford, invading by enter
taining as it were. This product is the video cassette
recorder.
"According to Robert Hensley, program coordina
tor for Residential Education, some of the most pop
ular items in the office are the VCRs. Res Ed owns
about 20 of the machines, all of which are available to
student living groups. Hensley said that reservations
for the machines are sometimes made three weeks
ahead of time.

"Of 19 on-campus houses surveyed, all of them ei
ther own a VCR or borrow one from Res Ed on a reg
ular basis.
"The most popular overall use of the recorders is
educational, especially in dorms that borrow from
Res Ed. Many houses hire speakers whose talks are
augmented by a prepared video cassette. In addition,
Res Ed itself owns many educational video cassettes,
with topics ranging from rape education to eating dis
orders to current events.
"Recreation runs a close second to education. Most
of the houses surveyed have had a 'Video Night/
Slumber Party,' in which the RAor a group of interest
ed students from a house borrow the local Res Ed ma
chine, rent from two to five cassettes and sit around in
front of the tube all night with consumables.
"Because of its educational and recreational uses,
the VCR is considered to be benevolent technology.
All the house RAs agreed that the machine has pro
vided students with two things: entertainment and a
sense of community.
Bottom Line: Now VCRs are out and DVDs are in. Man, do you
feel old.
