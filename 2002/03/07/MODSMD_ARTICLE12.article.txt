GARDEZ, Afghanistan (AP) —
Fierce fighting raged fora fifth day
as the United States deployed
hundreds of reinforcements yes
terday and gathered 5,000 Afghan
troops for an offensive aimed at
finishing off al-Qaida.
The U.S.-led coalition mount
ed punishing, round-the-clock
airstrikes above the rugged ter
rain in eastern Afghanistan and
some U.S. officers predicted the
operation could be wrapped up
in days. In Kabul, five peacekeep
ers — two Germans and three
Danes — were killed in an explo
sion while trying to defuse anti
aircraft missiles.
The Pentagon said opposition
fighters were still putting up stiff
resistance after five days of battle,
some of it above 10,000 feet in
snow-covered mountains. As fight
er jets and bombers hit targets,
more attack helicopters were
called in to boost the firepower in
the largest U.S.-led offensive of the
5-month-old war.
The commander of the opera
tion, code-named Operation Ana
conda, said U.S.-led troops had
the upper hand after killing hun
dreds of fighters — about half the
al-Qaida members holed up in the
hijls around the village of Shah-e-
Kot. U.S. troops were searching
their cave hide-outs.
"We own the dominant terrain
in the area," Maj. Gen. Frank L.
Hagenbeck told reporters yester
day at Bagram Air Base north of
the capital, Kabul.
"We truly have the momentum
at this point."
Gen. Tommy Franks, the U.S.
commander in the war in
Afghanistan, said he has increased
the number of Americans in the
operation by 200 to 300 over the
past two days, fora total of rough
ly 1,100.

About 1,000 or so more
Afghans have been fighting along
side the Americans, and their com
mander said they were also bring
ing in fresh units, drawing from
parts of Paktia province as well as
Logar province to the north and
Ghazi province to the west.
"There are 5,000 soldiers col
lecting in Shah-e-Kot fora final of
fensive on the al-Qaida to finish
them off," said Ismail Khan, a
commander who brought in men
from his base in Jaji, northeast of
Paktia's capital, Gardez.
Hagenbeck said more enemy
fighters, most of them from
Osama bin Laden's al Qaida terror
network, but also some Afghan
Taliban, have been infiltrating the
60 square-mile-area battle zone
south of Gardez — up from some
200 at the start of fighting Satur
day to as many as 600 to 700 by
yesterday.
The intelligence office of the
Paktia government passed out
leaflets and made announce
ments from loudspeakers in
Gardez offering $4,000 to any
one who captures an al-Qaida
fighter. It appeared the local gov
ernment was putting up the re
ward money.
In Kabul, Prime Minister
Hamid Karzai said the coalition
was prepared to take as long as
necessary to crush al-Qaida.
U.S.-led infantry units have
cleared out several cave hide-outs
and al-Qaida compounds, includ
ing some where troops found AK
-47 ammunition, medicine, night vi
sion devices and documents — in
cluding a Saudi identification card.
Eight American servicemen
have been killed in the operation
so far — seven in two attacks on
helicopters Monday and another
in a ground battle on Saturday, the
operation's first day.
