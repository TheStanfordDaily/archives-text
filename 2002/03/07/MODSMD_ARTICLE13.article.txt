## The
						Stanford Daily Pac-10 Tournament hurts teams and athletes 
### 
Published Since 1891

We join Stanford men's basketball
coach Mike Montgomery and
Arizona coach Lute Olson in de
nouncing the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's decision to reinstitute a post-season con
ference basketball tournament. The tourna
ment was reinstated for little more than pub
licity and revenue, and its existence can harm
student-athletes' national championship aspi
radons and academic development.
We laud Montgomery for making a state
ment and showing a commitment to scholar
ship by allowing his players to attend class yes
terday instead of departing early for the
scheduled practice time at the Staples Center
in Los Angeles.
The NCAA Tournament begins next week,
meaning Stanford's athletes will have been
off campus for four weekends in a row.

Teams that go deep into the NCAA Tourna
ment often miss weeks of classes, and the Pac
-10 Tournament just adds to the problem.
From a strategic standpoint, conference
tournaments seem to do little to boost a
team's performance in the Big Dance. In
stead of a week to rest and regroup after an
extremely competitive season, the Pac-10
schools now must travel and face their
fiercest rivals in a physically and emotionally
draining format.
Last year the absence of a conference tour
nament seemed to provide the Pac-10 with
distinct advantages come tournament time.
Four of the Pac-10's five tournament teams
reached the Sweet 16, and three squads, Ari
zona, Stanford and Southern California,
made it at least to the Elite Eight. As evi
denced by Olson and Montgomery's outspo

ken criticism of this weekend's contest, each
coach used the break in action to regroup
and prepare his team to play its best basket
ball of the season.
While the Pac-1() squads looked fresh and
hungry, many higher seeds struggled to fin
ish games, especially those that had pro
gressed to the final rounds of their respective
conference tournaments. Teams such as
Florida, Oklahoma and North Carolina com
peted at the highest level in their conference
tournaments, but fell to less-talented oppo
nents in the early rounds.
In no game was the edge of an extra week
of practice more apparent than in No. 6 seed
USC's 74-71 win over No. 3 Boston College.
The Golden Eagles had fought their way to a
Big East Tournament championship, and
lacked the energy to win a close game with

the more physical Trojans.
But this year the Pac-10 teams will be de
prived of these advantages for no purpose.
The tournament will show little that the
other 18 conference games could not. Basi
cally it demonstrates that Pac-10 leadership
couldn't stand that they were forgotten dur
ing Championship Week.
While the nation tuned in to watch the At
lantic Coast Conference and Big 10 wear
themselves out just in time for March Mad
ness, the Pac-10 left the fan's eyes and pock
etbooks fora fleeting moment. So this year
the Pac-10 will stand on equal footing with
its tournament-holding compatriots. The
conference will make its money and garner a
few extra days of national exposure. And it
will hurt its teams and its student-athletes in
the process.
