# CANNONBALL COMING
## I learned to write with chalk 'cause we couldn't afford paper 
### 
A couple of weeks ago, Sen.
Robert Byrd and Paul O'Neill,
Secretary of the Treasury,
turned a normally polite Senate
Budget Committee hearing into a debate
about who started out in lite with less.
It caused a momentary tizzy inside the
Beltway. Usually congressmen turn vitri
olic only when faced with a crippled,
lumbering elephant of a target. [It's not
difficult to talk tough when one arro
gant, asinine Enron executive after an
other comes before the Senate to cow
ardly invoke the Fifth Amendment.]

But, this encounter
broke the usual rules con
cerning, as the Washing
ton Post put it,"the nor
mal dance of senatorial
courtesy and polite grov
eling by administration
witnesses."
It shouldn't have been
that surprising. No mat-

ter how well-off Americans become, we all
want to be the underdog, the self-made
man. We all want to pretend we're living
the American Dream.
The encounter began when Byrd, an
85-year-old Democrat from West Vir
ginia who has been in Congress for over
50 years, lodged his objections to a
speech that O'Neill gave last year in
which the Secretary said many congres
sional regulations restricted human po
tential and were "like Lilliputians tying
us to the ground."
Specifically, he was referring to a rule
that requires 60 votes in the Senate on
important provisions of tax bills. It is
commonly referred to as the Byrd Rule.
The hearing quickly devolved into an
angry argument between the two that in
cluded O'Neill taking a thinly veiled swipe
at Byrd's former membership in the Ku
Klux Klan (is anyone really surprised?).
But the really memorable exchanges
involved each trying to prove that he had
entered the world in more abject poverty.
"Senator, I started my life in a house
without water or electricity, so I don't
cede to you the high moral ground of not
knowing what life is like in a ditch," said
O'Neill, who made roughly $59 million
in his last year as the chairman of Alcoa,
an aluminum conglomerate, before join
ing the Bush administration.
"Well, Mr. Secretary," Byrd respond
ed, "I lived in a house without electricity
too. No running water, no telephone, a
little wooden outhouse."
"I had the same," O'Neill said in turn.
"I started out in life without any rungs in
the bottom ladder," Byrd said. "I can stand
toe to toe to you. I haven't walked in any cor
porate boardrooms. I haven't had to turn
any millions of dollars into trust accounts. I

wish I had those millions of dollars."
Two enormously powerful and
wealthy men were engaged in a pissing
contest about whose social and economic
ascendance was more impressive. They
could just as easily have finished their ar
gument in the back seat of their chauf
feured car home or on the first tee on
Sunday morning.
But it's not just grandstanding politi
cians who have conversations like this.
They happen at Stanford all the time.
Even though the majority of people on
campus come from upper-middle class
families, everyone wants some street cred.
When Nas says"I love the hood" to MTV
News, you know he's not talking about Bev
erly Hills. So, if you want people to think
you're "real," but you in fact went to a nice
private school on Philadelphia's Main Line,
you'll add, "but I didn't live there." God for
bid someone thinks you're rich.
Or, if you have a sweet house in Long
Beach, you'll be sure to make clear that,
regardless, you went to the same ghetto
high school as Snoop.
Or, if you're from a nice neighbor
hood in Northern Virginia, you're going
to say you're from D.C., or if pushed,
that your suburban high school was the
worst in the county. You definitely don't
want anyone to think you had any ad
vantages growing up.
This desire for successful people to
exaggerate their sorry past is a little ab
surd, but normal. That's because, as a so
ciety, we still treasure the idea of the
American Dream.
Admittedly, many people at Stanford
grew up in difficult situations and/or at
tended rough schools. But, the fact that
this experience is worn as a badge of
honor is instructive.
It shows that we all want to start a notch
or two lower on Senator Byrd's conve
nient ladder of life. Why? Because we still
want to think of America as a meritocracy.
And for that to be true, we have to believe
that those on the top of society, like stu
dents at Stanford, have done it the old
fashioned way. They've earned it.
Sure, the American Dream is largely a
myth. Our last two Presidential candidates
were the sons of a president and a senator.
But that fact was held up as a constant
negative against George W. Bush and A1
Gore in the campaign, while Bill Clin
ton's journey from a white-trash exis
tence in small-town Arkansas to a white
trash existence in the Oval Office en
thralled the media and the public in
1992. Does the wealth or poverty of their
family affect their ability to be president?
No. Then why was it important? Because
the American dream lives on.

It's alive enough in our popular con
ception that senators and cabinet secre
taries want to brag about their hard
knock lives. And, it's still relevant enough
in pop culture that sons and daughters of
senators, cabinet secretaries, doctors,
lawyers, military officers and business ex
ecutives want their friends to think that
even their little journey to Stanford was
from rags to riches.
In short, everyone still wants to be
lieve in a place called Hope. Even if they
just dropped a few hundred at the Stan
ford Mall.

involved each trying to prove that he had
entered the world in more abject poverty.
"Senator, I started my life in a house
without water or electricity, so I don't
cede to you the high moral ground of not
knowing what life is like in a ditch," said
O'Neill, who made roughly $59 million
in his last year as the chairman of Alcoa,
an aluminum conglomerate, before join
ing the Bush administration.
"Well, Mr. Secretary," Byrd respond
ed, "I lived in a house without electricity
too. No running water, no telephone, a
little wooden outhouse."
"I had the same," O'Neill said in turn.
"I started out in life without any rungs in
the bottom ladder," Byrd said. "I can stand
toe to toe to you. I haven't walked in any cor
porate boardrooms. I haven't had to turn
any millions of dollars into trust accounts. I

wish I had those millions of dollars."
Two enormously powerful and
wealthy men were engaged in a pissing
contest about whose social and economic
ascendance was more impressive. They
could just as easily have finished their ar
gument in the back seat of their chauf
feured car home or on the first tee on
Sunday morning.
But it's not just grandstanding politi
cians who have conversations like this.
They happen at Stanford all the time.
Even though the majority of people on
campus come from upper-middle class
families, everyone wants some street cred.
When Nas says"I love the hood" to MTV
News, you know he's not talking about Bev
erly Hills. So, if you want people to think
you're "real," but you in fact went to a nice
private school on Philadelphia's Main Line,
you'll add, "but I didn't live there." God for
bid someone thinks you're rich.
Or, if you have a sweet house in Long
Beach, you'll be sure to make clear that,
regardless, you went to the same ghetto
high school as Snoop.
Or, if you're from a nice neighbor
hood in Northern Virginia, you're going
to say you're from D.C., or if pushed,
that your suburban high school was the
worst in the county. You definitely don't
want anyone to think you had any ad
vantages growing up.
This desire for successful people to
exaggerate their sorry past is a little ab
surd, but normal. That's because, as a so
ciety, we still treasure the idea of the
American Dream.
Admittedly, many people at Stanford
grew up in difficult situations and/or at
tended rough schools. But, the fact that
this experience is worn as a badge of
honor is instructive.
It shows that we all want to start a notch
or two lower on Senator Byrd's conve
nient ladder of life. Why? Because we still
want to think of America as a meritocracy.
And for that to be true, we have to believe
that those on the top of society, like stu
dents at Stanford, have done it the old
fashioned way. They've earned it.
Sure, the American Dream is largely a
myth. Our last two Presidential candidates
were the sons of a president and a senator.
But that fact was held up as a constant
negative against George W. Bush and A1
Gore in the campaign, while Bill Clin
ton's journey from a white-trash exis
tence in small-town Arkansas to a white
trash existence in the Oval Office en
thralled the media and the public in
1992. Does the wealth or poverty of their
family affect their ability to be president?
No. Then why was it important? Because
the American dream lives on.

It's alive enough in our popular con

in pop culture that sons and daughters of
senators, cabinet secretaries, doctors,
lawyers, military officers and business ex

even their little journey to Stanford was
from rags to riches.
In short, everyone still wants to be

A couple of weeks ago, Sen.
Robert Byrd and Paul O'Neill,
Secretary of the Treasury,
turned a normally polite Senate
Budget Committee hearing into a debate
about who started out in lite with less.
It caused a momentary tizzy inside the
Beltway. Usually congressmen turn vitri
olic only when faced with a crippled,
lumbering elephant of a target. [It's not
difficult to talk tough when one arro
gant, asinine Enron executive after an
other comes before the Senate to cow
ardly invoke the Fifth Amendment.]

But, this encounter
broke the usual rules con
cerning, as the Washing
ton Post put it,"the nor
mal dance of senatorial
courtesy and polite grov
eling by administration
witnesses."
It shouldn't have been
that surprising. No mat-

ter how well-off Americans become, we all
want to be the underdog, the self-made
man. We all want to pretend we're living
the American Dream.
The encounter began when Byrd, an
85-year-old Democrat from West Vir
ginia who has been in Congress for over
50 years, lodged his objections to a
speech that O'Neill gave last year in
which the Secretary said many congres
sional regulations restricted human po
tential and were "like Lilliputians tying
us to the ground."
Specifically, he was referring to a rule
that requires 60 votes in the Senate on
important provisions of tax bills. It is
commonly referred to as the Byrd Rule.
The hearing quickly devolved into an
angry argument between the two that in
cluded O'Neill taking a thinly veiled swipe
at Byrd's former membership in the Ku
Klux Klan (is anyone really surprised?).
But the really memorable exchanges
involved each trying to prove that he had
entered the world in more abject poverty.
