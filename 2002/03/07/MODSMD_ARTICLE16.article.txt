Stanford Band responds to editorial
Last week, the Band violated its alcohol
probation. This much is true. We screwed
up, we'll take our medicine for it, and de
servedly so. It was most manifestly not a
shining tribute to our scintillating wit and
glorious musical ability. Not like that
Notre Dame thing.
We feel we'd be performing a disservice,
however, should we allow the Daily reader
ship to base their conclusions on an editori
al so clearly, and badly, misinformed.
First off, the mixture identified as
"vomit" was in fact an unholy miasma of
various foodstuffs, including ketchup, oat
meal, flour, and maple syrup — "feral
odor"-producing, perhaps, but certainly
not indicative of the kinds of dangerous
behaviors implied in the editorial.
Secondly, it was stated that noble,
right-thinking custodians both discov
ered and refused to clean this mess. The
Daily's own front-page story, however,
contains the truth, which is that an un
fortunately-timed fire-strobe inspection
discovered the evidence of a typical Tree
Night. There was certainly no expecta
tion that "custodians [would] clean up
such a mess." The Band has never had
janitorial service; we lovingly lay claim to
our own detritus, and clean it up, as our
good mothers taught.
Indeed, Band members had begun the
annual post-Tree-Night ritualistic tidying
by 10:30 that morning; by late afternoon,
the building was in its usual immaculate
condition, aided as we were by the mea
sures taken to protect our home by those
in charge of the Tree Night festivities.
, The accusation that we "destroyed Uni
versity property," is, quite simply, baseless
and untrue. No property was destroyed,
no life form threatened. We made a mess.
And then cleaned it up.

The inaccuracies of the Daily editorial
aside, we feel that a larger point is at issue
here, beyond alcohol restrictions and trav
el suspensions, and that is trust. We'd like
to be able to trust the administration to re
spect our freedom to be the group we are:
slightly nutty, a little off-color, pushing the
edge of t he envelope.
They'd like to be able to trust us to not
break anything or anyone while we do
that thing we do. It is important that the
Office of Student Affairs, the Depart
ment of Atheltics, and the student popu
lation as a whole all understand that we
accept responsibility for our own stupid
ity, and toil even now to root it out, like a
pig after truffles.
We firmly believe that our aims are
not counter to those of the Office of Stu
dent Affairs and our own beloved Athlet
ics Department. Such violations as have
happened are not acceptable, and will
not be repeated.
Look. The Band is made up of intelli
gent, caring folk who are capable of acting
responsibly, whatever the situation. We
have never equated wanton, drunken de
struction with a good time — that's not
what we're about. What we are about is en
tertaining and having fun, and with these
issues resolved, that's exactly what we'll
continue to do.

Morris Graves 'out of touch'
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris Graves
thinks the Band Shak is cleaned by custo
dians? I have friends in the Band and I've
been to the Band Shak — no suggestion
could be more ridiculous.
If Morris Graves is so out of touch
with students that he thinks the Shak is

cleaned by custodians, no wonder he
keeps laying down arbitrary and unrea
sonable suspensions.

Senior responds to Amelia Estrada's letter
After reading Amelia Estrada's letter
in The Daily on March 6, I feel it is nec
essary to clear up some of the miscon
ceptions and misinformation she has un
wittingly transmitted.
In her letter, Estrada asserts,
"Women have been stripped of their
special nature, their fertility and their
deepest longings." How, I ask, is this
possible? I can safely assert that my fer
tility and longings and yes, even my "spe
cial nature" (although I'm not sure ex
actly what that entails) are most certainly
still intact, despite my living in a post
sexual revolution, post-feminism era.
Estrada also presents a much more
troubling point of view in her argument
that feminism has negatively affected the
status of women. While she is entitled to
her opinion, her analysis is conceptually
flawed and factually inaccurate.
First of all, feminism itself does not rep
resent hard and fast rules for how
women should behave in society; rather,
it represents a lens through which
women can analyze the role of gender in
their lives. And there are indeed a myri
ad of different approaches to analyzing
women's status and their empowerment,
hence the number of different types of
feminism in existence, from liberal to
radical feminism, socialist feminism,
African American feminism, Third
