# Row houses compete to save energy
## Student Housing Services to announce winners of conservation competition 
### GEORGE K. TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University housing officials plan to an
nounce the six winners of the fall quarter
energy-conservation competition for Row
and cluster houses by mid-March.
Robert Kolar, facilities coordinator for
Student Housing Services, cited the mis
sion behind this contest.
"Our goal was to provide an incentive
to students to save electricity by [encour
aging] small changes in their habits."
Kolar said. "Our hope was to educate the
students about the visible impact they
can make on the overall consumption in
their house."
The competition was founded this year
by staff members of Student Housing Ser
vices. Housing Facilities Supervisors Mako
Ushihara and Paul Lynch, as well as Un
dergraduate Housing Operations Manag
er Imogen Church and Kolar spearhead
ed the effort.
The idea was sparked by the discovery

of energy-inefficient appliances concen
trated in Row and cluster houses.
" The concept came after recognizing
the fact that many of the Row and cluster
houses had very old refrigerators that
were constandy running and in poor con
dition," Kolar said. "Newer Energy Star
refrigerators use up to 60 percent less en
ergy than older units."
The prizes that will be rewarded to win
ners of the competition appropriately re
flect this observation.
"The prize comes in the form of a new
house-owned refrigerator," Church said.
"Since we are awarding six new refrigera
tors among 21 houses, approximately one
out of four houses will be a winner."
Winners will be determined by com
paring last year's electricity November to
February The six winners will be those
houses that had the highest percentage re
duction in electricity.
Kolar explained the reasoning behind
this process.
"Since each house is different in size
and population, we decided to compare
each house against itself to determine con
sumption savings," Kolar said.
Housing authorities also plan to adjust
energy consumption readings to eliminate
inequities among houses, including dift'er

ences in billing-period length and changes
in occupancy.
Although participation in the contest
was voluntary, officials were nonetheless
able to observe a strong dedication stu
dents had to energy conservation.
"I've noticed that some of the houses
participating in the contest made very
deliberate efforts to conserve energy,"
Ushihara said. "Some went as far as to
ask Student Housing Services to install
energy-saving light bulbs in fixtures and
add motion sensors to turn off lights in
unused areas."
Some houses have taken a less aggres
sive but just as valuable approach.
"One of the Row houses had a sign
over a light switch in a common area that
read 'Help us conserve energy â€”if you
don't need this light, switch it off,'"
Lynch said.
This high level of student effort has ma
terialized into noticeable energy savings,
according to housing officials.
"We published a progress report in
January that indicated some houses were
on pace to save in excess of 15 percent [in
energy consumption]," Kolar said.
The positive results from this competi
tion are encouraging housing staff to pro
mote additional resource conservation

strategies, according to Church.
"We will continue to partner with the
residences across campus in this educa
tional campaign to help save energy in as
many areas as we can," Church said.
Student Housing Services will likely
redirect its efforts to promote conser
vation of another common yet impor

tant resource.
"{Student Housing Services] plans to
continue partnering with our residents
to find ways to save on all utilities,"
Kolar said. "However, water consump
tion is a big area of focus for the campus
right now, so that is a likely area of fu
ture contests."
