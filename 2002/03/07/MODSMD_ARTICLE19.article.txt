WASHINGTON (AP)— Pres
ident Clinton could have been
indicted and probably would
have been convicted in the scan
dal involving former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky,
Independent Counsel Robert
Ray contended yesterday in his
final report.
Writing his last chapter on the
affair that damaged the former
president's second term, Ray said
Clinton lied in January 1998 testi
mony denying a sexual relation
ship with Lewinsky. Clinton also
"impeded the due administration
ofjustice" by drawing presidential
secretary Betty Currie into his
false account, Ray added.
"The independent counsel
concluded that sufficient evi
dence existed to prosecute and
that such evidence would 'proba
bly be sufficient to obtain and
sustain a conviction," said the re
port, quoting from Justice De
partment guidelines for bringing
criminal cases.
Just before Clinton left office
early last year, his lawyers made
an arrangement with Ray that
spared him from criminal
charges in the Lewinsky affair.
In addition to admitting that he
"knowingly gave evasive and
misleading answers" about his

sexual relationship, the presi
dent surrendered his law license
for five years.
Revealing few new facts,
Ray's assessment was criticized
by Clinton defenders.
Julian Epstein, former chief
Democratic counsel to the House
Judiciary Committee, called the
report's conclusions "a bone
thrown to the right wing," which
Epstein said was unhappy that the
Lewinsky matter was settled short
of indictment.
"The $70 million investiga
tion of President Clinton from
1994 to 2001 was intense, expen
sive, partisan and long ... and
there's nothing new in this re
port," said Clinton lawyer David
Kendall. Regarding Ray's find
ings in the Lewinsky matter, "it's
not clear what the purpose of the
report is other than to promote
Robert Ray's Senate campaign,
Monica Lewinsky's HBO special
and the Paula Jones vs. Tonya
Harding boxing match," said
Jennifer Palmieri, a former
spokeswoman for Clinton.
Ray acknowledges that he is
considering seeking the nomina
tion to challenge Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., but has not an
nounced his candidacy or filed
any paperwork.
