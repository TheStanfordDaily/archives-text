# FTC gives merger permission
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Federal regulators yes
terday approved the proposed $22 billion merger of
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp.,
a deal that would be the biggest in high-tech history.
Announcing the decision, the Federal Trade
Commission said it voted to close its antitrust investi
gation of the proposed deal. The 5-0 commission
vote requires no additional action from the compa
nies to meet antitrust requirements.
The merger still faces a tough shareholder
vote, with Hewlett and Packard family interests
opposing it.
The FTC "conducted an extensive investigation of
the merger's effect on competition in markets for
personal computers, servers and microprocessors,
among other products," the agency said. "The com
mission did not find reason to believe that the pro
posed transaction would impair competition in any
relevant market."
HP Chairwoman and Chief Executive Carly Fior
ina said the FTC decision "validates our conviction
from the outset that the merger can only enhance
competition throughout our markets."
"We are now focused on winning the shareowner
vote," she said.
Michael Capellas, Compaq chairman and
chief executive, said "with the FTC approval, it is
clear that we are building momentum in the
marketplace."
"We believe the merger will create a world-class
technology company to the ultimate benefit of share
holders, customers and employees," he said.
HP shareholders are scheduled to vote on March
19. Compaq shareholders, who are to vote the next
day, are expected to approve the deal.
Paul McGuckin, a vice president with Gartner
Inc., an analysts firm, said the approval had been ex

pected and is a boost to merger supporters.
"It's not a certainty that the merger is going to get
approved, but it's certainly better than a 50-50
chance now," he said. HP, based in Palo Alto, Calif.,
and Compaq, based in Houston, believe merging will
improve the economics of their struggling personal
computer divisions and generate $2.5 billion in sav
ings. The deal also would make them dominant in
several growing technology markets, especially cor
porate computing and high-tech services. European
and Canadian antitrust officials have already ap
proved the merger.
On Tuesday, Institutional Shareholder Services,
an influential research firm based in Rockville, Md.,
said HP's acquisition of Compaq could be an excel
lent long-term move despite its si/able risks.
Walter Hewlett and other opponents worry that
absorbing Compaq into HP would be a difficult and
distracting process and that Compaq would dramat
ically increase HP's exposure to the slumping PC
business at the expense of the profitable printing and
digital imaging division.
HP and Walter Hewlett have been locked for
months in a bruising, political-style campaign for
shareholder support, and it is expected to only in
tensify as the vote gets closer.
In a statement Wednesday, Hewlett said, "We all
know that regulators vociferously express concern
when there is even a whiff of competitive advantage
in a merger."
"We believe that HP stockholders should be con
cerned when competitors like Sun, Dell and IBM
don't object to a transaction that is supposed to add
value to HP," he said.
More than 20 percent of HP shares, including
those held by the Hewlett and Packard families, are
lined up against the acquisition.
