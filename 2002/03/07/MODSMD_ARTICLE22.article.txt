### ANNE NYBORG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter losing its past two games
against Cornell and Syracuse, the
Stanford women's lacrosse team
(3-2) came back strong Tuesday
night to beat St. Mary's (0-3), 15-7.
Sophomore midfielder Abbi
Hills led off the offensive action,
putting the Cardinal on the score
board at 4:11 but Megan Bryan,
St. Mary's leading scorer, was
quick to answer scoring at 4:27.
The Gaels kept it close by play
ing a running game as the majori
ty of its goals came on fast breaks.
The Stanford offense had sev
eral standout performances. At
halftime the score was 6-5, but the
offense came out fired up and ig
nited for nine second-half goals.
Freshmen center Kelsey Twist,
was instrumental in the offensive at
tack, making key draw possessions
and settling the Cardinal down.
In the last two minutes of the
game, Stanford was in the zone.
Just after the two-minute mark;
sophomore attacker Jess Scott
fired a goal. She was quickly fol
lowed by Hills, who put in one and

freshman midfielder Julia Cal
zonetti, who scored two goals in
the remaining seconds of the
game, as Stanford ran away from
the Gaels.
' Scott said, "It was the most fun
lacrosse I've ever played."
Hills, Scott, tri-captain Liz Britt
and freshman defender Nina
Pantano all tallied three goals for
the Cardinal.
But it wasn't all about offense
for Stanford, as the Cardinal de
fense had a strong game with pow
erful performances by sopho
mores Katie Grube and Larissa
Conte as well as junior goalkeeper
Virginia Soloman.
Conte played a powerful role in
gaining ball possession and start
ing off transitions down the field.
"Larissa's anticipation in the
game was really great," said tri
captain attacker Kim Cahill.
Grube marked Bryan and made
an offensive charge on the part of
the leading scorer nearly impossi
ble. At one point, Bryan made sev
eral attempts at entering the eight
meter zone but all were shut down
by Grube. Conte joined Grube in a
double team and Bryan ended up
on the ground and without the ball.
Soloman likewise played a very
aggressive game, pressuring play
ers and running behind goal to
gain ball position.
The settled defense was strong
and the Cardinal's pressure result
ed in key turnovers.
"[The team J proved to them
selves that when you believe in each

other and your abilities you can play
for more than 20 minutes solid,"
said head coach Michele Uhlfelder.
In preparing for its upcoming
game against Notre Dame this Sat
urday Uhlfelder wants Stanford to
work on getting organized and
limiting its lulls. She believes the
game against St. Mary's taught the
team the value of ball possession
and protection.
