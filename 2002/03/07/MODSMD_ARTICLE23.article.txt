### DEB SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the No. 3 Stanford softball
squad (19-2) got a taste of home before heading
out to Tampa, Fla for its final pre-season tour
nament of the year.
Stanford played the first night game in pro
gram history under the newly installed lights at
the Smith Family Stadium, downing the Baylor
Bears (26-5), 5-2.
Junior pitchers Tori Nyberg and Maureen
LeCocq both made appearances in the win as
Nyberg started in the circle and LeCocq. fin
ished the victory.
The Cardinal pounced on the Bears in
the first as senior infielder Robin Walker led
off with a triple. Later, LeCocq and junior
outfielder Cassi Brangham produced back
to-back RBI singles, putting Stanford
ahead, 2-0.
The Cardinal attacked again in the bottom
half of the second and scored two more runs
to lead the Bears 4-0. With two outs, senior
outfielder Jessica Mendoza tripled to center
field to score Walker, who had singled to
reach base. Senior first baseman Sarah Bee
son followed with an RBI single down the left
field line to score Mendoza.

The Bears answered back this time.
With one run in the top of the third, Baylor's
Kelly Levesque came around to score on Kris
ten Lancaster's fielder's choice, cutting the lead
to 4-1.
However, Nyberg ended the Bears run,
and Stanford came back to add a final run in
the bottom of the third as Brangham sent a 2-
2 pitch over the right-field fence for her sec
ond home run of the season and a 5-1 Stan
ford lead.
The relentless Bears attempted to come
back again as Sarah Caudle scored their sec
ond and final run of the game on a fielder's
choice in the sixth inning. Again, Nyberg did
not allow the rally to continue, as she shut
down the Bears after a single run and closed
out the inning.
Nyberg improved her record to 12-1 on
the year, working six innings and scattering
five hits while striking out three. LeCocq
came in for the seventh inning and hurled a
hitless inning in relief to close out the game.
The Cardinal pitching has been excellent
so far this season and the coaching staff is
quite pleased.
"Tori's done an amazing job with her op
portunity to step up," said associate head coach
and pitching coach Lonni Alameda. "She has

really taken the bull by the horns and done a re
ally good job.
"Today was an amazing day for Maureen,"
said Alameda. "We have made some huge
strides with her and I think we are really in a
good place with both her and Tori. We are just
very excited."
After its win the Cardinal went to bed,
packed its bags and took off for Florida.
The Speedline Invitational in Tampa fea
tures teams from across the nation and will
wrap up the Cardinal's four-tournament series
around the country.
The tournament, hosted by South Florida,
follows a pool-play format before breaking into
tournament play on Saturday afternoon.
First up for the Cardinal will be Western
Michigan (2-6), which suffered two losses (4-
2 to Michigan State and 11-2 to Pittsburgh)
on Monday afternoon before its weekend
trek to Tampa. The Broncos, just kicking off
their season, are eager to try and steal a win
from Stanford. The Cardinal wears a target
on its back this season as the No. 3 team in the
nation.
Illinois-Chicago (12-5) is Stanford's op
ponent in the nightcap on Thursday. The
Flames are thrilled just to get the chance to
play. Illinois-Chicago was crowned co-tour
nament champions with Tulsa after the
Holiday Inn-Select Festival championship
match was cancelled when over eight inch
es of snow fell on the area. Assistant coach
Tom Gray will be a familiar face to both
Cardinal junior pitcher Dana Sorensen and
freshman infielder Elizabeth Bendig, as
both played for him on their former travel
team the Batbusters.
Hofstra (0-7) will be looking for revenge
from the Cardinal, as Stanford blanked the
Pride 4-0 in last season's NCAA Regional.
Hofstra will also be searching for its first
win of the year when it faces Stanford on
Friday afternoon.
Stanford will then take on Georgia
Southern (5-13), which is hitting just. 182 as
a team this season and will be looking to
break out of its offensive slump. The Eagles
will be challenged as Nyberg and LeCocq
are dominating their opponents so far this
season, holding them to a combined .188
batting average.
The final scheduled opponent of the Invita
tional is Penn State (3-8), which has dropped its
last five games, including Monday's 3-2 loss to
Central Michigan.
Fhe Cardinal will look to keep its bats hot
and pitching strong this weekend as well as take
the tournament tide in Florida to finish its run
around the nation victorious.
