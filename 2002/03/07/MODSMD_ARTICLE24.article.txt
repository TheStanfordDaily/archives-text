# Cardinal heads to Arizona for desert duel
## No. 3 women's tennis to face No. 8 Arizona and No. 45 Arizona St. 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
tennis team (10-1, 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) heads clown to Ari
zona this weekend hoping to add a
couple more wins to its perfect con
ference record. The Cardinal will
face off against No. 8 Arizona State
(6-1,3-1) on Friday and No. 45 Ari
zona (5-4, 1-3) on Saturday.
Playing two road matches in
harsh conditions against two top
opponents will be a good test for (he

Cardinal, which has been nothing
but dominant since its loss to now
No. 1 Georgia (11-0) a month ago at
the Team Indoors.
"Both teams play really well on
their home courts, so it's definitely a
challenge," senior Lauren Kalvaria
said.
Although this road trip has for
tuitously been scheduled fora time
of year in which the desert climes
are less oppressive, the conditions
are nonetheless a concern.
At Arizona State, altitude is a fac
tor, causing balls to sail farther than
they would at sea level; at Arizona
"it's hot and the courts are really
fast," sophomore Lizzy Bennett
said.
"It's definitely difficult, but we've
been there before and we're ready

for it," Bennett said.
Arizona State has the edge on
Arizona, having defeated the Wild
cats 6-1 in a February match.
The Cardinal matches up favor
ably with its weekend opponents
not only in terms of record and
team ranking but also on a person
nel basis.
Stanford has four singles players
in the latest I IA rankings: No. 11
Kalvaria (11-3 overall, 5-0 dual
matches), No. 14 sophomore Lau
ren Barnikow (18-5,9-1), No. 16 se
nior Gabriela Lastra (16-6,7-2) and
No. 21 freshman Erin Burdette
(20-5,9-1). Kalvaria and Lastra are
the nation's No. 2 doubles team (13-
1,5-0), and Barnikow and Burdette
are No. 10(17-5, 7-2).
Arizona State's only ranked

player is No. 29 Adria Engel. Ari
zona offers No. 25 Maja Mlakar
and No. 77 Debbie Larocque, who
combine to form the country's No.
13 doubles tandem.
The Cardinal, however, is not
about to take the Arizona schools
lighdy, especially on their courts. It
knows better.
"We're very strong mentally,"
Bennett said. "The Pac-10 is going
to be difficult, but we're confident
that we're going to win it."
Although the Cardinal has
played fewer conference matches
than other Pac-10 schools, it has
played more matches overall. Stan
ford has yet to lose a team point in
Pac-10 play, having shut out both
No. 14 California and No. 60 Ore
gon thus far.
Although the Cardinal faces a
challenge on the courts this week
end, there are many positives to
going on the road. In addition to
being a g<x)d test of the team's met
tle, it's a fun experience for the
team to travel together.
"We all get along well and enjoy

each other's company, so we're
looking ti >rwarci to it," Kill varia siiicl.
"The traveling is a blast," Bur
dette said. "It's really fun."
Although the Cardinal has not
dwelled on iLs loss this year— its
first in two years — it nonetheless
understands the importance of win
ning every match. This weekend,
on iLs first fiill-fledged Pac-10 road
trip, the squad will_gain a greater
knowledge of how it stacks up
against its conference opponents.
« "It's going to be a good tester for
the Pac-10," Burdette said.
