# Swimming readies for conference meet
## 
### KENNETH GARRETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One thing is clear coming into this
weekend's men's swimming Pacific 10
Conference Championships: the compe
tition is going to be vying for second place.
Though the Pac-10 is undoubtedly
the toughest swimming conference in
the country, the top-ranked Cardinal (8-
0, 4-0) has decimated its conference foes
every time out this season, setting na
tion-best times and pool records along
the way. There is no reason to believe
the showdown starting today in Long
Beach will end any differently.
Even fora team like the Cardinal,
however, the path leading to that victory
won't be an easy one.
"All the teams have really talented
athletes and are capable of putting up
some good swims," said freshman Eric
Dilulio.
Ironically, the Cardinal's dominance
has played a large role in raising the cal

iber of the teams that it now has to com
pete against.
"People in the Pac-10 are not afraid to
swim really fast because they've seen us
do it against them," said senior tri-cap
tain Michael O'Neil.
While it's true that each Pac-10 team
has its share of stars, no team has the
Cardinal's depth. It is by consistently
claiming multiple top spots, not just first
place, that the points really add up for
Stanford.
To continue that strategy, the Cardi
nal will need to focus not on what other
teams are doing, but on what everybody
knows Stanford can do.
"A lot of teams out there know we
have the potential to swim fast, and the
challenge will be living up to that poten
tial," said junior Dan Westcott.
After a hard season of physical train
ing, this is the time when mental prepa
ration comes to the fore. The Pac-10
Championship meet is a grueling three
day event, and every Cardinal swimmer

will have to perform multiple times at the
highest levels. Their bodies are ready;
now they need to focus on their minds.
Since American records are likely to
fall this weekend, elation will be run
ning high.
"You have to manage your emo
tions," O'Neil said. "You can't be satis
fied after you have one great swim the
first day and let your guard down."
While it is important to win Pac-lOs,
the focus ihis weekend is really on the
NCAA championship in three weeks.
"This is the last conference meet in
the country, so everybody is looking to
see what we tan do," Westcott said.
"We're looking forward to posting the
results that will put us ahead going into
NCAAs."
Also on the minds of the Cardinal is
the fact that Stanford has won the Pac-10
Championship every year for the last 20
years. While this creates some pressure,
