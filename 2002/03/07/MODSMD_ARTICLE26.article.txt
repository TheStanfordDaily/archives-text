## Stanford extends its win streak to three over the national champions 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
How the mighty have fallen.
This year, the No. 1 Stanford
women's water polo team has
handed the defending national
champion UCIA all of its three
losses on the year, while catapult
ing itself to a 10-0 start.
The Cardinal (10-0, 2-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) de
feated UCLA (8-3, 2-1), 6-4 in Los
Angeles on Sunday after opening

conference play on Saturday with
a 9-2 win over UG-Santa Barbara.
"The importance of this win
has a lot to do with the fact that it
was a conference game," head
coach John Tanner said. "We
have eight more conference
games, and by winning this game
we cleared one of our biggest hur
dles of the season."
Junioi Julie Gardner opened
the scoring for the Cardinal with
a goal late in the first quarter, but
the Bruins answered back only a
minute later. The back-and
forth battle continued as Gard
ner scored again to put the Car
dinal up one, a lead that was
again quickly erased by the Bru
ins. But, senior Ellen Estes deliv

ered, sending the Cardinal into
halftime with a 3-2 Cardinal lead.
Out of the break, the battle con
tinued with UCLA tying the game
3-3. Gardner then notched her
third goal of the game in the clos
ing seconds of the third quarter to
once again put Stanford ahead.
Sophomore Brenda Villa broke
the back-and-forth scoring pattern
with her fourth-quarter goal that
put the Cardinal up, 5-3. The
Bruins would find the net one last
time in the match, but it would not
be enough as Villa added a penal
ty shot goal late in the game to put
the game out of reach at 6-4.
Gardner led the team offensive
ly with three goals, followed by
Villa's two, while junior Jackie

Frank was strong in the net with
live saves on the day.
"They were very aggressive and
came out very strong and sus
tained the energy throughout the
match," Tanner said. "They've
gotten better as we've played, but
we've gotten better as well."
On Saturday, the Cardinal
opened its conference season at
UC-Santa Barbara. The Cardinal
wasted no tiiye, as it scored four
goals in the first quarter and didn't
stop the scoring onslaught until it
had accumulated a 9-0 lead.
After holding the Gauchos
scoreless through the first three
quarters, Santa Barbara finally
managed to break through the
tough Cardinal defense with two
goals in the final period.
Five different Cardinal players
scored in the game, led by Villa
with three, senior Margie Din
geldein and Estes with two and
Gardner and sophomore Wendy
Watkins with one each.
Gardner's four-goal perfor
mance this weekend brought her
season total to 11 and earned her
MPSF Player of the Week honors.
I his is the second week in a row
that a Cardinal player has earned
this honor. Villa was honored last
week.
"We've been working on im
proving our overall offense, and
that includes working on our two
meter play and that's where [Julie]
scored her goals," Tanner said.
"She scored in three very different
ways. It was a wonderful game for
her and a great game for our team
because we attacked well and cre
ated a lot of opportunities."
Next, Gardner and the Cardi
nal will travel to Hawaii to face the
Warriors on March 10.
"[Hawaii] plays very well at
home and in previous years when
we play them at Stanford we do a
lot better than when we play them
there. They feel comfortable at
home and it's very easy for teams
to get complacent when they go to
Hawaii," Tanner said.
