# Women's gymnastics stays hot for Beavers
## 
### SARAH LINDSEY STAFF WRITER 
As the Stanford women's gym
nastics team prepares to say
goodbye to its three seniors, the
team looks to continue a rather
quirky streak. The Cardinal has
scored 195 points or more in its
last seven meets, showing its im
proved consistency, technique
and enthusiasm, all of which
were goals at the outset of the
season.
Stanford added this seventh
above-195 meet this weekend
against No. 14 Oregon State in an
exciting meet in Corvallis.
The 196.700-196.000 victory
over the Beavers showed No. 8
Stanford's increasing toughness
on the road.
The Cardinal (8-3,5-1 Pacific 10
Conference) showed off its energy
and excitement throughout the
whole meet. The night was fittingly
brought to an end in the last event,
the beam, when sophomore Lise
Leveille got first place with a 9.900.
Sophomore Lindsay Wing
rounded out the victories for the
Cardinal earning second place in
that event and also tying with se
nior Becky Meldrum for second
on the bars.
Senior Katy Herbert took sec
ond place on the vault while
freshman Mandy Delgado,
sophomores Shelly Goldberg
and Kendall Beck and junior
Alissa Cooper all tied for third
place on the vault.
"The thing that is really cool
about this past weekend is that we
did really well, but we can still im

prove and get better, which is mo
tivating going into the postsea
son," Wing said.
But before the Cardinal heads
into the postseason, it has to cross
one last hurdle. Tomorrow at 7:30
pm, Stanford will compete in its
last regular season home meet
against Seattle Pacific (3-7).
The Falcons will come to Burn
ham Pavilion just 27 hours after
facing their number one rival in
the region, UC-Davis.
While the Cardinal will look
to put final touches on its rou
tines against the struggling Seat
tle Pacific squad, the met will also
be an emotional one for the Stan
ford women.
Tomorrow will mark the clos
ing of a chapter for seniors Becky
Meldrum, Kristin Jensen and
Katy Herbert. Four years and one
Pac-10 championship later, these
girls will have to say their final
goodbye to their gymnastics ca
reers on the Farm.
"This meet against Seattle
Pacific will mark Katy, Kristin
and my last home meet in Burn
ham Pavilion," said Meldrum.
"I absolutely love competing
here, and I am certainly going
to miss it."
And the rest of the team will
certainly miss the skill and guid
ance that the seniors bring to
the gym.
"We have fantastic seniors this
year," said Wing. "They have pro
vided so much leadership for us. It
will be great to be able to honor
them at the meet and thank them
for all that they have done to con
tribute to this team."
