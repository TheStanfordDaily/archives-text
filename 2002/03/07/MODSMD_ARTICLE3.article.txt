# 'Urban Nights' hit the Farm
## Campus dance groups prepare for an eclectic weekend performance 
### KRISTIN SCHLEICHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today, Friday and Saturday, some of
Stanford's most talented dancers and
choreographers will take the Dinkelspiel
Auditorium stage in a unique collabora
tive show called Urban Nights. The
show will feature a diverse mixture of
ballet, jazz, hip-hop and modern dance
with an emphasis on contemporary style
and music.
Cardinal Ballet initially set up the
event to showcase the professionalism
and variety of dance at Stanford. The

ballet troupe invited dance groups Bent
Spoon and Urban Styles, lecturer Robert
Moses, and many student choreogra
phers to submit and perform works.
Freshman Michelle Jonelis said that
she was excited for the chance to par
ticipate in one of the student-created
dances. "The dance is very alternative
and modernesque," Jonelis said, "a
contrast to how people normally imag
ine ballet."
Sophomore Ginger Turner, said that
Cardinal Ballet would blend tradition
and fun in its works. She explained that
the on-campus show would be a good op
portunity for Stanford students to get ac
quainted with the group.
"In the past Cardinal Ballet perfor
mances have been off campus," Turn-

er said.
Junior Amanda Ose, who will
dance with both Cardinal Ballet
and Urban Styles, agreed.
"The fact that we got so many
ballet dancers is something the
campus hasn't seen before,"
Ose said.
Turner offered another posi
tive aspect of the venue choice.
"Dinkelspiel has a wonder
ful, really big stage for dance,"
she said.
The spacious venue will be put
to good use, junior Eleanor Tripp
remarked. She said that Cardinal
Ballet's last piece on the program,
"Who Cares," will feature 20
dancers on stage at the same time.
'"Who Cares' is going to be very
indicative of the Urban Nights
theme," Tripp said.
Lucien Postlewaite, a guest
artist from the School of American
Ballet in New York City, de
scribed the final dance as "con
temporary, classical jazz ... it is
set to Gershwin and the set is a
New York skyline."
Junior Rebecca Whitehurst,
who has been working as co-artis
tic director of the event in addi
tion to directing the Bent Spoon
group, said that lighting and set
design would thread the show to
gether thematically.

"For the Urban Nights theme
we strive to create a constant
weaving ofdark and light," White
hurst said. "A chaotic setting and
darker stage tlows in the second
half to a more happy, light, posi
tive note."
Whitehurst said that the collab
orative program has strength
ened the larger dancing commu
nity at Stanford.
"We are all still under the ban
ner of dance and have common
spaces in which to meet," she said.
"The Stanford campus has incred
ible dancers in all genres."
Whitehurst said that Bent
Spoon, though generally de
scribed as a modern dance com
pany, will fuse many genres with
in their own program.
"Our dances are an amalgama
tion of all other styles in this show:
ballet, hip-hop, jazz, modern and
post-modern," she said.
Senior Rhiannon Meier, the di
rector of Urban Styles, catego
rized her group's performance as
"Los Angeles-style jazz."
"Urban Styles usually does small
impromptu performances," Meier
said, and frequently travels to off
campus venues in San Francisco.
Meier added that the audience
should look forward to unique
lighting, wigs, and masks in the
group's dance to "Skin" from
Madonna's "Ray of Light" CD.
"The music is something you
would hear at a club of the fu
ture," Meier said.
