# Will the third time be the charm against USC?
## Borchardt looking to take leadership role after huge game against Arizona 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
LOS ANGELES — In Arizona last
week, Curtis Borchardt just didn't
seem like Curtis Borchardt.
The junior center consistently
yelled at his teammates to focus and he
rarely smiled. He pointed, he stared
and he scoffed at will.
Frankly, it couldn't have come at a
better time.

Today-Saturday: No. 17 Stan
ford competes at tne Pac-10 Tour
nament, Los Angeles

With a Stanford team that has, at
times, lacked vocal leadership this
season, it was certainly a welcome
sight, even from the perspective of
the players who endured Bor
chardt's wrath.
"He yelled at me a couple times but
I thought it was good," sophomore
forward Joe Kirchofer said. "It was a
way to get everyone playing hard and
on the same page."
Borchardt, who was named the Pa
cific 10 Conference Player of the Week
after averaging 23.5 points, 13 re
bounds and 2.5 blocks in the Cardi
nal's victories last week, said he will
keep the same intensity from here on
out. That includes today's first-round
game of the Pac-10 Tournament
against No. 4 seed Southern California
(20-8, 12-6 Pac-10) at the Staples Cen
ter in Los Angeles.
"Sometimes it may rub guys the

wrong way, but that's just on the court.
If they do something good, I try to be
positive. But everybody has to be play
ing hard - that's my main goal," Bor
chardt said.
As surprising as it may be, Bor
chardt, a player with the nice-guy
image and the boyish grin off the
court, acted similarly in high school.
When he was a star player at Eastlake
High in Redmond, Wash., a school
that only won half of its games, Bor
chardt admits he occasionally got in
his teammates' faces and bellowed in
structions.
However, when he arrived at Stan
ford, Borchardt wasn't one of the best
players on the team, and he said that
he was reluctant to open his mouth.
It wasn't until last Thursday in Tuc
son that the beast in Borchardt finally
emerged.
"Everything felt like it was do-or
die in high school. Last weekend felt
like it was do-or-die too," Borchardt
said. "My emotions kind of took over a
little bit, but it helped me stay more in
tense and I think the team stayed
more intense."
There is no question that the No. 5-
seeded Cardinal (19-8. 12-6) will need
to be intense for all 40 minutes if it ex
pects to handle USC, the only confer
ence team that Stanford has not beat
en this season.
Both times, Stanford has been
taken out of its rhythm — in the first
game by a stifling full-court press and
in the second game with a well orga
nized half-court defense.
According to senior point guard
Tony Giovacchini, Stanford's play
ers must slow down and focus on the
Cardinal offense, rather than suc
cumbing to the fast-paced play of the
Trojans.
Giovacchini also noted the impor
tance of getting the ball to Borchardt,

who was double-teamed most of last
game and was held to only five shots
from the field.
"You've got to make an effort to
look for him, but he's got to make an
effort to ask for the ball and demand
the ball," Giovacchini said. "1 don't
think we looked for him enough, and
I don't think he demanded the ball
enough last time."
The Trojans have been a thorn in
Borchardt's side. He injured his right
foot two years in a row against USC
and missed Stanford's first matchup
in Los Angeles in January because of
a right hip pointer. When he finally
got the chance to play, he was held to
just 10 points and six rebounds in
Stanford's 77-58 loss at Maples two
weeks ago.
So what does he plan to do differ
ently this time?
"Maybe I'll make shots on the
perimeter. But when I do get the ball
in my hands, I'll have to make a quick
move or make a quick decision and get
a good shot for me or someone else on
the team," Borchardt said.
At the other post spot, the presence
of sophomore forward Justin Davis,
who missed the last USC game, should
allow fora more balanced attack.
"Last time we really got stuck on
one side of the floor," Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery said. "USC has not
guarded some people and they have
gotten away with that. We have to have
five players playing their best at one
time."
Count on one of Stanford's new
vocal leaders tojumpstart the entire
team.
"There are times when Curtis gets
mad,"junior guard Julius Barnes said.
"It's good because it's the time of the
year when guys need to step up and be
vocal and take that leadership role.
There's no better time than now."

If Julius Barnes can explode in the Pac-10 Tournament, Stanford's odds of getting a high seed in the NCAA
Tournament will only get better.
