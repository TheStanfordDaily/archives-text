# Wacky weekend in Oregon for all
## Arizona State upset in title game caps inaugural tourney 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
Some thought the inaugural
Pacific 10 Conference Tourna
ment might be anticlimactic, what
with the juggernaut that is Stan
ford women's hoops rolling into
Eugene, Ore., carrying a perfect
18-0 regular season record in the
conference.
They were wrong.
With the exception of Stanford,
which secured an invitation to the
NCAAs long ago, the rest of the
Pac-10 came to McArthur Court
prepared to battle it out in a last
ditch campaign to earn a spot on
the big tournament's roster.
To complicate matters further,
the Cardinal headed to Eugene
without leading scorer Lindsey
Yamasaki. The senior forward sat
on the bench recovering from her
a recent appendectomy.
Mac Court was ripe for drama,
and the first-ever Women's Pac-10
Tournament delivered, hosting a
veritable cache of emotional bas
ketball over a thrilling four days.
Playing on their home court in
front of the sea of loud and bois
terous fans that define "The Pit,"
the Ducks struck gold in their sec
ond game of the tournament on
Saturday. They crushed rival
Washington 78-64 in one of the
most physical matchups of the
tourney.
Senior Shaquala Williams led
Oregon to victory with 20 points,
including four 3-poiniei s.
"T his is still our house," said
Williams. "They can cover up all
the ()regon stuff, but those are still
our fans and this is still our court."
Oregon State then went out and
matched its in-state counterparts

with a thrilling game that went to
the wire against Southern Califor
nia and capped a day of outstand
ing competition. Led by senior Fe
licia Ragland, the Beavers pulled
off the 69-68 win over the Trojans
in a heart-stopper.
With four seconds left in the
game and the score tied at 67,
Ebony Hoffman went to the free
throw line to shoot two and grab
the win for the Women of, Troy.
After making only one of two from
the charity stripe, there was still an
opportunity for Oregon State and
Ragland to stage a last-ditch come
back.
A court-long pass to Ragland
resulted in a USC foul that sent
her to the line. Ragland had
missed two free throws earlier in
the contest, but the smile on her
face made it obvious she wasn't
going to let it happen again.
"I missed two foul shots earlier
in the game and I don't usually
miss free throws," said Ragland.
"So, going to the line I knew I was
going to make them. It was pretty
cool."
The victory pitted the Beavers
against the Cardinal on Sunday in
a game that was all about Nicole
Powell.
Powell, named this year's Pac
-10 Player of the Year, entered
such a /one of athleticism in the
first half that no one, on either
team, could match her play.
After watching her team strug
gle offensively to find a rhythm
without Yamasaki, Powell, a
sophomore forward/guard,
pushed the ball on her own.
She drove inside against two
people, she pulled up with hands
in her face, she made fading turn
arounds, and with less than seven
seconds in the half, took the ball
the length of the court, beat her
defender, spun past a second
Beaver just beyond the three
point arch, and with yet another
defender hogging her air, nailed a

fading three to beat the buzzer.
No one in the gym doubted that
ball would go in once it left her
hands.
Her efforts successfully ad
vanced her team to the champi
onship game, while her 37 points
gave her a new career high and her
27 points in the first half bettered
the total Beaver output of 19.
"Nicole Powell got into that un

conscious zone she gets in now
and then," said Oregon State
coach Judy Spoelstra. "She
couldn't miss."
Monday night was the culmina
tion of it all, beginning with the
sudden appearance of a makeshift
"Stanford Band" and "Tree,"
whose average age suddenly in
