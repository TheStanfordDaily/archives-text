# Enough with the underdog worship
## 
### 
Being a woman, when I
tell people that I'm the
men's basketball side
bar writer, it always
elicits the same reaction:
The men always ask, "Can
you get me tickets?" To which I
always pretentiously answer,
"I'll see what I can do," know
ing good and well that my
media credential barely gets me

into Maples
Pavilion.
And women
are pretty pre
dictable with
their questions
as well, always
shyly asking,
"So do you ever
see (insert play-

er name here) naked in the lock
er room?" To which I giggle
coyly and answer their inquiry
as abstractly as possible with a
purposefully misleading state
ment, always making sure to
add a wink and a nod just to play
with their minds.
So what does being a female
writer have to do with the men's
basketball team and the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament
this weekend?
Well, I feel that as a female,
I've been socialized for the last
20 years to love the idea of a
fairy tale. I feel like America has
tried to convince me to root for
the underdog, which seems so
counter-intuitive to me because
when it comes down to the hier
archy of dogs, we're definitely
sitting on a self-made throne at
the top of the food chain.
Personally, I hate it when the
underdog wins — it just seems
so inherently wrong — which is
why I hate the idea of a postsea
son Pac-10 tournament, and
which is why this Cardinal men's
squad has forced in me an inter
nal struggle, of sorts, to redefine

my underdog-hating ways.
And, as I sat thinking about
this at 2 a.m. in Happy Donuts,
blurry-eyed and sleep-deprived
with my roommate who's just
finished her third cup of coffee; I
think that I see Kerri Strug. This
could be a hallucination. Please
keep in mind that it's late, and
the person that I think is Kerri
Strug could very well be just a
short girl with a blonde bob.
However, "seeing" the heralded
gymnast made me wonder:
Should I hate Kerri Strug
given my disdain for the under
dog?
1 mean, she did overcome im
mense odds to land that vault a
couple of years ago. She is, for all
intents and purposes, an under
dog.
After an apple fritter and a
couple donut holes 1 came to a
conclusion that I could justifi
ably cheer for her.
She's American.
And I'm American.
So I don't have to hate her,
forcing me to add a clause to my
once overly simplified disgust for
underdogs: if the person or
team, in some way represents
you, it's all right not to hate them.
Which means (thank God)
that I can root for the men's bas
ketball team, which is an under
dog this season for the first time
in a while.
As I watched the women's
basketball team lose Monday
night in the Pac-10 tournament
championship game, 1 couldn't
help but think that this is what
college basketball is all about —
this is what conference tourna
ments are all about.
Sure, the Pac-10 tournament
is exciting to watch from a spec
tator's point of view, but it is
built with this underdog-loving
