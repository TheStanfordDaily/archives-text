# Enough with the underdog worship
## 
### 
Being a woman, when I
tell people that I'm the
men's basketball side
bar writer, it always
elicits the same reaction:
The men always ask, "Can
you get me tickets?" To which I
always pretentiously answer,
"I'll see what I can do," know
ing good and well that my
media credential barely gets me

into Maples
Pavilion.
And women
are pretty pre
dictable with
their questions
as well, always
shyly asking,
"So do you ever
see (insert play-

er name here) naked in the lock
er room?" To which I giggle
coyly and answer their inquiry
as abstractly as possible with a
purposefully misleading state
ment, always making sure to
add a wink and a nod just to play
with their minds.
So what does being a female
writer have to do with the men's
basketball team and the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament
this weekend?
Well, I feel that as a female,
I've been socialized for the last
20 years to love the idea of a
fairy tale. I feel like America has
tried to convince me to root for
the underdog, which seems so
counter-intuitive to me because
when it comes down to the hier
archy of dogs, we're definitely
sitting on a self-made throne at
the top of the food chain.
Personally, I hate it when the
underdog wins — it just seems
so inherently wrong — which is
why I hate the idea of a postsea
son Pac-10 tournament, and
which is why this Cardinal men's
squad has forced in me an inter
nal struggle, of sorts, to redefine

my underdog-hating ways.
And, as I sat thinking about
this at 2 a.m. in Happy Donuts,
blurry-eyed and sleep-deprived
with my roommate who's just
finished her third cup of coffee; I
think that I see Kerri Strug. This
could be a hallucination. Please
keep in mind that it's late, and
the person that I think is Kerri
Strug could very well be just a
short girl with a blonde bob.
However, "seeing" the heralded
gymnast made me wonder:
Should I hate Kerri Strug
given my disdain for the under
dog?
1 mean, she did overcome im
mense odds to land that vault a
couple of years ago. She is, for all
intents and purposes, an under
dog.
After an apple fritter and a
couple donut holes 1 came to a
conclusion that I could justifi
ably cheer for her.
She's American.
And I'm American.
So I don't have to hate her,
forcing me to add a clause to my
once overly simplified disgust for
underdogs: if the person or
team, in some way represents
you, it's all right not to hate them.
Which means (thank God)
that I can root for the men's bas
ketball team, which is an under
dog this season for the first time
in a while.
As I watched the women's
basketball team lose Monday
night in the Pac-10 tournament
championship game, 1 couldn't
help but think that this is what
college basketball is all about —
this is what conference tourna
ments are all about.
Sure, the Pac-10 tournament
is exciting to watch from a spec
tator's point of view, but it is
built with this underdog-loving


Arisha Hatch
mentality in mind.
Really, what's the point of the
tournament?
The winner isn't regarded as (he
Pac-10 champion. They are metic
ulously titled the Pac-10 Tourna
ment Champion, which is in the
mind's of most, a step below the
Pac-10 regular season champion.
The only thing that the tourna
ment does do is give teams like Ari
zona State and Washington one
final chance to advance to the
NCAA tournament. The only way
that either of the two teams will see
NCAA action is if they can manage
to win three games in Los Angeles.
Stanford has everything to gain
from this trip down south: a little
more high-pressure game experi
ence will do the Cardinal some
good and the existence of a single
game-elimination tournament will
remind Stanford of the urgency
associated with March Madness.
UCLA, Cal, Arizona, USC will
benefit as well. The tournament
presents one more opportunity to
regain some confidence before
heading into the NCAAs.
But does Oregon have any de
sire to make a trip down to Los
Angeles?
Hasn't it already proved itself
worthy?
And in all actuality we wouldn't

even be talking about this tourna
ment if UCLA hadn't sold Arizona
and Stanford out, shifting its vote
to a resounding "yes." Their
switch made it eight of the confer
ence's 10 schools in favor of the
tournament.
In a conference like the Pac-10,
the best team is the one that has en
dured an entire season of peaks
and valleys to emerge with the best
record.
As odd as it may sound (and
however difficult it may be to swal
low), Oregon is the Pac-10's best
this year and three games this
weekend shouldn't change that.
All the conference tournament
can do is either diminish that ac
complishment or, with an Oregon
win, reiterate what a grueling sea
son of 18 games has already shown
the world.
What the tournament will not
do is keep any of its promises.
The best team will not win (be
cause in the Pac-10, a team's abili
ty to win is based more upon
match-ups than pure talent).
The games will not be held at a
neutral site, with the neutrality of
Staples being highly questionable.
USC and UCLA will have to travel
a combined 20 or so miles and will
have to endure the least disruption
of their everyday lives to partake in
the event.
And no Cinderella will arise in a
conference where Cinderella sto
ries happen every week and have
become expected and accepted.

I've been socialized for the last
20 years to love the idea of a
fairy tale. I feel like America has
tried to convince me to root for
the underdog, which seems so
counter-intuitive to me because
when it comes down to the hier
archy of dogs, we're definitely
sitting on a self-made throne at
the top of the food chain.
Personally, I hate it when the
underdog wins — it just seems
so inherently wrong — which is
why I hate the idea of a postsea
son Pac-10 tournament, and
which is why this Cardinal men's
squad has forced in me an inter
nal struggle, of sorts, to redefine

my underdog-hating ways.
And, as I sat thinking about
this at 2 a.m. in Happy Donuts,
blurry-eyed and sleep-deprived
with my roommate who's just
finished her third cup of coffee; I
think that I see Kerri Strug. This
could be a hallucination. Please
keep in mind that it's late, and
the person that I think is Kerri
Strug could very well be just a
short girl with a blonde bob.
However, "seeing" the heralded
gymnast made me wonder:
Should I hate Kerri Strug
given my disdain for the under
dog?
1 mean, she did overcome im
mense odds to land that vault a
couple of years ago. She is, for all
intents and purposes, an under
dog.
After an apple fritter and a
couple donut holes 1 came to a
conclusion that I could justifi
ably cheer for her.
She's American.
And I'm American.
So I don't have to hate her,
forcing me to add a clause to my
once overly simplified disgust for
underdogs: if the person or
team, in some way represents
you, it's all right not to hate them.
Which means (thank God)
that I can root for the men's bas
ketball team, which is an under
dog this season for the first time
in a while.
As I watched the women's
basketball team lose Monday
night in the Pac-10 tournament
championship game, 1 couldn't
help but think that this is what
college basketball is all about —
this is what conference tourna
ments are all about.
Sure, the Pac-10 tournament
is exciting to watch from a spec
tator's point of view, but it is
built with this underdog-loving


Arisha Hatch
mentality in mind.
Really, what's the point of the
tournament?
The winner isn't regarded as (he
Pac-10 champion. They are metic
ulously titled the Pac-10 Tourna
ment Champion, which is in the
mind's of most, a step below the
Pac-10 regular season champion.
The only thing that the tourna
ment does do is give teams like Ari
zona State and Washington one
final chance to advance to the
NCAA tournament. The only way
that either of the two teams will see
NCAA action is if they can manage
to win three games in Los Angeles.
Stanford has everything to gain
from this trip down south: a little
more high-pressure game experi
ence will do the Cardinal some
good and the existence of a single
game-elimination tournament will
remind Stanford of the urgency
associated with March Madness.
UCLA, Cal, Arizona, USC will
benefit as well. The tournament
presents one more opportunity to
regain some confidence before
heading into the NCAAs.
But does Oregon have any de
sire to make a trip down to Los
Angeles?
Hasn't it already proved itself
worthy?
And in all actuality we wouldn't

even be talking about this tourna
ment if UCLA hadn't sold Arizona
and Stanford out, shifting its vote
to a resounding "yes." Their
switch made it eight of the confer
ence's 10 schools in favor of the
tournament.
In a conference like the Pac-10,
the best team is the one that has en
dured an entire season of peaks
and valleys to emerge with the best
record.
As odd as it may sound (and
however difficult it may be to swal
low), Oregon is the Pac-10's best
this year and three games this
weekend shouldn't change that.
All the conference tournament
can do is either diminish that ac
complishment or, with an Oregon
win, reiterate what a grueling sea
son of 18 games has already shown
the world.
What the tournament will not
do is keep any of its promises.
The best team will not win (be
cause in the Pac-10, a team's abili
ty to win is based more upon
match-ups than pure talent).
The games will not be held at a
neutral site, with the neutrality of
Staples being highly questionable.
USC and UCLA will have to travel
a combined 20 or so miles and will
have to endure the least disruption
of their everyday lives to partake in
the event.
And no Cinderella will arise in a
conference where Cinderella sto
ries happen every week and have
become expected and accepted.
Being a woman, when I
tell people that I'm the
men's basketball side
bar writer, it always
elicits the same reaction:
The men always ask, "Can
you get me tickets?" To which I
always pretentiously answer,
"I'll see what I can do," know
ing good and well that my
media credential barely gets me

into Maples
Pavilion.
And women
are pretty pre
dictable with
their questions
as well, always
shyly asking,
"So do you ever
see (insert play-

er name here) naked in the lock
er room?" To which I giggle
coyly and answer their inquiry
as abstractly as possible with a
purposefully misleading state
ment, always making sure to
add a wink and a nod just to play
with their minds.

writer have to do with the men's
basketball team and the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament
this weekend?
