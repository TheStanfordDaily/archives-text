Stanford and Nu Skin Enter

a cure for Epidermolysis Bullosa,
or EB, recently won them the
prestigious "Gold Triangle
Award" given annually by the
American Academy of Dermatol
ogy. The award recognizes and
honors media, industry, health
community, public service and in
dividual efforts that advance the
understanding of dermatological
issues and encourage healthy be
haviors in the skin care.
EB is a congenital disorder
that causes fragility of the skin
and mucous membranes.
"The award was really competi

tive," Medical School Prof. All ane,
chair of the Department of Derma
tology, said. "It was an honor for
the company ... a way we could
tell Nu Skin 'thank you.' "
Nu Skin and the One Founda
tion pledged close to $9 million
worth of stock in 1999 to create the
Nu Skin Center tor Dermatologi
cal Research at the Medical School.
The center primarily focused
on dermatological investigation,
product development, patient
care and training.
This initiative was spearheaded
by a "mother who had twochildren
that died of EB," Lane said. "From
that [experience] she started the EB
Medical Research Foundation."
Nu Skin is a Salt I -ike C -ity-based
direct marketer of personal aire

and nutritional products.
I"he One Foundation is a non
profit organization established by
Nu Skin Co-founder and Chair
man Blake Roney and wife Nancy.
It has provided contributions
to Stanford dermatology re
search since 1996.
"Nu Skin supports Stanford's
research in gifts while Stanford puts
their products to tri;il runs," Lane
said. "We do clinical trials for Nu
Skin and try to if [their pnxl
ucts] work or not."
At the unveiling of its latest
Epoch line of personal care
items, Nu Skin announced a con
tribution to "P.S. The Children,"
an organization that brings heal
ing and restoration to the lives of
abused children.
