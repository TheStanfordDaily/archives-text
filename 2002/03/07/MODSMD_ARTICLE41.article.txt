NEW YORK (AP) — Boston College
helped its NCAA tournament hopes
Wednesday by rallying from a double
digit deficit to beat Rutgers 60-55 in the
opening game of the Big East tournament
at Madison Square Garden.
The victory put the Eagles (20-10) in
the Big East quarterfinals on Thursday
against No. 7 Pittsburgh. That will be a re
match of last year's championship game,
which BC won, 79-57.
The Eagles made just five field goals in
the first half, shooting 15.2 percent, the
lowest half in the history of the tourna
ment. Rutgers (18-12) led 33-22 at the
break.
"I was wondering what kind of coach
ing job 1 was doing," BC coach A1 Skinner
said. "I told that to my assistants. I was
hoping we wouldn't play that kind of half
again."
They didn't.

Troy Bell and Kenny Walls, who each
shot 1-for-10 in the first half, made quick
baskets in the second half to get BC back in
the game. BC's Ryan Sidney had a game
high 20 points.
Georgetown 68, Providence 67
The Hoyas (19-10) also boosted their
NCAA bid chances — but just barely.
Wesley Wilson's dunk with 3.8 seconds
left gave Georgetown the victory, allowing
the Hoyas (19-10) to move on to the quar
terfinals against No. 20 Miami (23-6).
Providence (15-16) had a last chance at
the upset, but John Linehan was unable to
get off a clean shot. The Friars lost their
fifth straight Big East tournament game.
Villanova 78, Syracuse 64
Gary Buchanan scored 21 points and
Villanova closed the game with a 14-3 run,

19 Connecticut (21-6), which won the con
ference's East Division.
Syracuse (20-11) lost its fourth straight
game and ninth of its last 13, weak num
bers for the NCAA selection committee to
mull over as the field of 65 is settled, ft was
Syracuse's first loss in five opening-round
games.
Preston Shumpert's turnaround
jumper with 4:00 left brought Syracuse
within 64-61, but Buchanan hit a jumper
48 seconds later to start Villanova's closing
run.
Shumpert had 21 points for the Or
angemen, who shot 51.9 percent from the
field in the first half (14-for-27), but that
fell off to 31.6 percent in the second (12-
for-38).
