# No.1 seeds still up in air for basketball elite
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
All, tournament time. That time of
year where ESPN turns into the Psy
chic Friends Network, with all the
supposed basketball masterminds
declaring endless projections of No. 1
seeds, regional seeds and tourney
hopes for teams on the bubble.
No amount of analysis will satisfy
our ever-elusive hopes for figuring
out how the NCAA tournament se
lection committee finally arrives at
the magical brackets that dominate
the lives of women's basketball fans
throughout the month of March.
But that doesn't mean we won't
try.
The best place to start is where
everybody thinks it will eventually
end up: with No. 1 UConn. After
soaring through their season with a
33-0 mark and winning the Big East
tournament by a whopping 42
points in the championship game,
some wonder if the selection com
mittee should simply hand the
Huskies the championship trophy,
let alone simply the No. 1 seed in
the East.
As UConn is content to revel in
its No. 1 seed, a handful of other
teams are looking to destroy the
Husky dynasty, and the first step
could possibly lie in clinching a No.
1 seed in the tourney.
While things appeared crystal
clear a week ago — with Tennessee
and Stanford essentially clinching
top seeds while Duke and Oklahoma
battled it out for the final No. 1 —*
both the Lady Vols and the Cardinal
fell in their conference tourneys,
showing how tournament time can
make even the strongest dynasties a
little weak in the foundation.
Thanks to those losses and the
Blue Devils' undefeated roll through
both the ACC regular season and
conference tournament, it looks like
Duke has assured itself of a No. 1.

A No. 1 seed is now Oklahoma's
to lose, and if the Sooners can roll
through this week's Big 12, tourna
ment, they could take the No. 1
West seed from Stanford's hands,
preventing the West Coast from
once again having a legitimate No. 1
seed of its own. Of course, with the
Big 12 nothing is guaranteed, as
Baylor and Colorado are both try
ing to assure themselves of playing
on their own home court for the
first two rounds by getting a No. 4
seed or above.
SEC Tournament champion
Vanderbilt stole the crown from the
Lady Vols' grasp after Pat Summit's
squad fell to Louisiana Tech in the
semifinals. After struggling with
consistency all season, Vandy might
steal the No. 1 seed as well.
Indiana's upset of Big Ten pow
erhouse Purdue should throw an
other loop in the seedings, as the
Boilermakers most likely will drop
from their expected No. 2 seed.
And how about that Pac-10? With
Washington's loss in the first round
of the conference tourney, and no
team except Stanford and Arizona
State boasting more than 17 wins, it
looks like the conference might only
get two teams into the tournament.
But the Pac-10 isn't the only
perennial powerhouse that could be
largely absent from this year's tour
nament, as some of the perennial
powerhouses in women's basket
ball, including Georgia, Rutgers
and North Carolina State have all
dribbled their way to shaky regular
season records — and possibly right
into the WNIT.
Whatever mystical pairings the
selection committee cajoles amid
the RPI rankings, strength-of
schedule formulas, and good old
fashioned intuition, one thing is cer
tain: after the wealth of upsets that
have already occurred this March,
this year's Big Dance promises to be
one wild ride.

Enjoli Izidor played well at the Pac-10 Tournament for the Cardinal, and the senior guard's
leadership on the court should prove invaluable in the NCAA Tournament.
