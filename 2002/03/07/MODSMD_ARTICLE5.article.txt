# Daniel Pearl fund established
## Benefactor makes donation in slain journalist's name 
### CHRISTINE LIYANTO 
The Daniel Pearl Memorial Fund
was recently created to benefit Stanford
students in the name of slain journalist
Pearl, who received a bachelor's in com
munication from Stanford in 1985.
The intended focus of the fund is to pro
vide financial aid to students in journalistic
and communications-oriented studies.
Becky Smith, an administrative services ad
ministrator for the University, emphasized
that the rewards of the fund will be chan
neled towards undergraduates.
University President John Hennessy
announced that the mastermind behind
the fund is an anonymous Stanford alum
nus, who established the endowed fund

with a starting gift of $50,000.
According to Smith, the anonymous
benefactor called Pearl's widow Mariane
at her home a week before his memorial
service to propose the idea fora fund in
her late husband's name.
"It was not someone who knew Daniel
Pearl but was just [someone] touched by
the story," Smith said.
Pearl, 38, was remembered fondly
during the service held for him at Memo
rial Church last Monday.
"I can think of no better way to honor
[Pearl] than to live our lives in a way that
would make him proud of his alma
mater," Hennessy said at the service.
According to Smith, one of the goals of
the fund is to carry on the memory of Pearl
while serving a purpose to which the jour
nalist had dedicated his life — intertwin
ing the voices and perspectives of different
niches of the world and society through

journalistic studies and communication.
The Department of Communication
and other faculty members are still in the
process of configuring the details of how
donations to the fund will be allocated to
its undergraduates, Smith said. An un
dergraduate scholarship and an annual
prize honoring student journalists are
among the possibilities.
Since the fund was established as an
endowment, a portion of the money will
be available every year. Preference will
be given to communication majors, be
cause the Communication Department
was the arena in which Pearl left his
strongest mark.
Donations to the Daniel Pearl Memor
ial Fund can be sent to Memorial Gifts,
326 Galvez St., Stanford, CA 94305-6105.
