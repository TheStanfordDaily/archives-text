# Cancer drug may combat HIV
## Medical Center researchers learn that drug kills infected cells only 
### KHANH LAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford Medical
Center have discovered that a drug
used to treat cancer — called Gd-
Tex — may also be effective in combat
ing HI V. The drug could help AIDS pa
tients by targeting HIV-infected cells,
without harming healthy cells that de
fend the body against disease.
HIV weakens the body's immune
system by killing white blood cells with

CD4 receptors, particularly a class of
white cells called CD4+ T-cells. These
cells normally coordinate the body's de
fense system by stimulating immune

system cells and natural killer cells to at
tack foreign invaders. HIV destroys
CD4+ T-cells, leaving the patient sus
ceptible to common infections.
Stanford researchers have found
that low doses of Gd-Tex — or motex
afin gadolinium — kill HIV-infected
CD4+ T-cells, while still leaving healthy
ones intact.
"Gd-Tex selectively killed the HlV
infected cells when I hey were in a mix
ture of healthy white blood cells," Ge
netics Prof. Emeritus Leonard Herzen
berg, the senior author of the study,
said. "To our surprise, only the infected
CI)4 + T-cells were killed."
"Our findings were extremely un-

expected," Omar Perez, a phar
macology graduate student at
the Medical Center's Nolan Lab
oratory, said. Perez is the prima
ry author of the study reported
in the Feb. 19 issue of the Pro
ceedings of the National Acade
my of Sciences.
Gd-Tex is currently undergo
ing clinical trials in brain cancer
research. The drug is manufac
tured under the brand name
"Xcyclin Injection," and is pro
duced by the Pharmacyclics com
pany in Sunnyvale.
In radiation treatment of can
cer, Gd-Tex has been shown to
cause glutathione levels to drop.
This process induces apoptosis, a
kind of "cell suicide" in cancer
cells.
When Herzenberg and his
spouse Lee Herzenberg — a ge
netics professor — learned about
Gd-Tex, they thought the drug
might also be effective in control
ling HIV. Earlier studies had
shown that HIV attacks the cell's
natural defenses by reducing lev
els of glutathione.
According to the Herzenbergs,
HIV-infected cells are already
under stress. Additional stress in
duced by Gd-Tex could be
enough to push these weakened
cells over the edge.

Following up on what he called
the Herzenberg's "wild hunch,"
Perez began treating HIV-infect
ed blood samples with Gd-Tex.
Perez then tested individual cells
and found that high levels of Gd-
Tex were toxic to all T-cells.
Lower levels of Gd-Tex, however,
were fatal only to the weaker
HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells.
"The first clue that Gd-Tex
worked was that the infected
CD4+ T-cells were disappear
ing," Perez said.
Subsequent work showed that
the CD4+ T-cells were commit
ting apoptosis. Since other blood
cells were not as compromised
by the HIV-infection, they sur
vived at the low doses of Gd-Tex
that were fatal to HIV-infected
helper T-cells.
In spite of the immense po
tential benefits of Gd-Tex in
HIV therapy, researchers re
main cautious.
"We need to make our analysis
very carefully," Perez said.
"There's a possibility that it might
not work in real life. There could
be toxicities found in HIV-infect
ed people that are not found in
cancer patients."
The Stanford Positive Care
Clinic is coordinating with the
Herzenbergs and Pharmacyclics
to begin clinical trials in HIV pa
tients.
"We are hopeful that our find
ing might have some therapeutic
value," Perez said.
