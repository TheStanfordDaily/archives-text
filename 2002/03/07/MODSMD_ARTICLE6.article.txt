# Cancer drug may combat HIV
## Medical Center researchers learn that drug kills infected cells only

Researchers at the Stanford Medical
Center have discovered that a drug
used to treat cancer — called Gd-
Tex — may also be effective in combat
ing HI V. The drug could help AIDS pa
tients by targeting HIV-infected cells,
without harming healthy cells that de
fend the body against disease.
HIV weakens the body's immune
system by killing white blood cells with

CD4 receptors, particularly a class of
white cells called CD4+ T-cells. These
cells normally coordinate the body's de
fense system by stimulating immune

system cells and natural killer cells to at
tack foreign invaders. HIV destroys
CD4+ T-cells, leaving the patient sus
ceptible to common infections.
Stanford researchers have found
that low doses of Gd-Tex — or motex
afin gadolinium — kill HIV-infected
CD4+ T-cells, while still leaving healthy
ones intact.
"Gd-Tex selectively killed the HlV
infected cells when I hey were in a mix
ture of healthy white blood cells," Ge
netics Prof. Emeritus Leonard Herzen
berg, the senior author of the study,
said. "To our surprise, only the infected
CI)4 + T-cells were killed."
"Our findings were extremely un-
