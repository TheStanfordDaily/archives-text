# Stewart discusses risks of journalism
## AP reporter recalls the gun wound he received in Sierra Leone 
### NAEL FAKHRY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The recent kidnapping and murder
of Daniel Pearl '85, a Wall Street Journal
reporter, has raised a host of questions
on how journalists covering conflicts
should deal with the threat of violence.
Lan Stewart, currently one of 20
Knight Fellows at Stanford, has experi
enced firsthand the risks of covering con
flicts abroad. As a reporter for the Associ
ated Press since 1995, Stewart has cov
ered Afghanistan, Pakistan, Vietnam,
Laos and most recently West and Central
Africa.
On Jan. 10, 1999, while covering a
rebel uprising in Freetown, Sierra

Leone, Stewart and his convoy were am
bushed by a group of rebels. A photog
rapher and a TV cameraman report ing
for the AP were also in Stewart's car at
the time.
"A rebel jumped in front of our car
and basically unloaded his gun at us,"
Stewart said. "He put one bullet through
the center of my forehead."
The cameraman, Myles Tirney, was
sitting directly adjacent to Stewart, and
he received multiple gunshots to the
chest and one to the head. He died on
the scene, while Stewart was airlifted to a
local hospital. The bullet that hit Stewart
traveled through the middle of his brain
and lodged at the back of his brain. It was
surgically removed 36 hours later.
"I was initially given a 20 percent
chance of surviving," Stewart said. "It's a
miracle that I made it.
"We were reporting on efforts by the
government to bring stability to the city
after a rebel assault. I suppose we looked

like a threat because we may have looked
like European mercenaries."
At the time of the ambush, Stewart
was traveling with a government convoy
that was busy recovering corpses follow
ing clashes between rebel forces and
Sierra Leone's government troops. The
attacker who killed Stewart's colleague
and nearly took Stewart's life was killed
immediately by government soldiers.
Initially, the left side of Stewart's body
was paralyzed, but he has since made sig
nificant progress toward recovery.
Today, he has use of his left leg, while his
left arm remains essentially functionless.
In spite of these traumatic events,
Stewart emphasized that, if he were ca
pable, he would love to return to the
Ivory Coast and continue as a journalist
in the region.
"If I had the physical means, I'd go
back in a second ... but it would be fool-
hardy to place myself in another
war situation when I can't run,"
Stewart said.
When asked about the case of
Pearl, Stewart stated that t he Jour
nal reporter did not subject him
self to undue risk.
"He was doing his job . . . you
have to take risks reporting in that
sort of environment. . . but I don't
think there's any story worth dying
for," Stewart said.
Stewart was quick to point out

that Pearl was not the first journal
ist to die covering the war in
Afghanistan. He said journalists
die every year covering interna
tional and domestic conllicts. The
Pearl incident does not serve as a
significant wake-up call for re
porters because the deaths of jour
nalists have become relatively fre
quent occurrences, according to
Stewart.
The prevalence of violence
committed against journalists has
led many observers to ask why re
porters do not take further mea
sures to protect themselves, such
as carrying firearms, wearing
Hack jackets and being escorted

by gunmen.
"I think it's a bad idea to have
bodyguards, to wear protective
gear 01 to carry a firearm," Stewart
said. "It's an affront to the ob
servers you interview because they
want protection as well but they
often can't afford it.
"Bodyguards 110 longer make
you a neutral observer of the
conflict because witnesses don't
know who they're talking to.
You're there as a reporter, not as
a player in the conflict, and car
rying a weapon destroys your
credibility."
Stewart said that the danger as
sociated with reporting in a war

torn legion can be both positive
and negative, as the thrill can drive
a reporter to delve deeper into a
story but can also lead the reporter
into unexpected danger, as was
the case for Pearl.
"It's a fine line to walk .... I
got more and more addicted to t he
adrenaline rush, and, in the case of
photographers, there's a huge
adrenaline rush when covering a
story," Stewart said.
Stewart said he hopes to be
come a national writer for the AP
covering domestic policy and its ef
fects on America's role in the
world, especially as related to
Africa and Asia.

conflict because witnesses don't
know who they're talking to.
You're there as a reporter, not as
a player in the conflict, and car
rying a weapon destroys your
credibility."
Stewart said that the danger as
sociated with reporting in a war

torn legion can be both positive
and negative, as the thrill can drive
a reporter to delve deeper into a
story but can also lead the reporter
into unexpected danger, as was
the case for Pearl.
"It's a fine line to walk .... I
got more and more addicted to t he
adrenaline rush, and, in the case of
photographers, there's a huge
adrenaline rush when covering a
story," Stewart said.
Stewart said he hopes to be
come a national writer for the AP
covering domestic policy and its ef
fects on America's role in the
world, especially as related to
Africa and Asia.
The recent kidnapping and murder
of Daniel Pearl '85, a Wall Street Journal
reporter, has raised a host of questions
on how journalists covering conflicts
should deal with the threat of violence.
Lan Stewart, currently one of 20
Knight Fellows at Stanford, has experi
enced firsthand the risks of covering con
flicts abroad. As a reporter for the Associ
ated Press since 1995, Stewart has cov
ered Afghanistan, Pakistan, Vietnam,
Laos and most recently West and Central
Africa.
On Jan. 10, 1999, while covering a
rebel uprising in Freetown, Sierra

Leone, Stewart and his convoy were am
bushed by a group of rebels. A photog
rapher and a TV cameraman report ing
for the AP were also in Stewart's car at
the time.
"A rebel jumped in front of our car
and basically unloaded his gun at us,"
Stewart said. "He put one bullet through
the center of my forehead."
The cameraman, Myles Tirney, was
sitting directly adjacent to Stewart, and
he received multiple gunshots to the
chest and one to the head. He died on
the scene, while Stewart was airlifted to a
local hospital. The bullet that hit Stewart
traveled through the middle of his brain
and lodged at the back of his brain. It was
surgically removed 36 hours later.
"I was initially given a 20 percent
chance of surviving," Stewart said. "It's a
miracle that I made it.
"We were reporting on efforts by the
government to bring stability to the city
after a rebel assault. I suppose we looked

like a threat because we may have looked
like European mercenaries."
At the time of the ambush, Stewart
was traveling with a government convoy
that was busy recovering corpses follow
ing clashes between rebel forces and
Sierra Leone's government troops. The
attacker who killed Stewart's colleague
and nearly took Stewart's life was killed
immediately by government soldiers.
Initially, the left side of Stewart's body
was paralyzed, but he has since made sig
nificant progress toward recovery.
Today, he has use of his left leg, while his
left arm remains essentially functionless.
In spite of these traumatic events,
Stewart emphasized that, if he were ca
pable, he would love to return to the
Ivory Coast and continue as a journalist
in the region.
"If I had the physical means, I'd go
back in a second ... but it would be fool-
hardy to place myself in another
war situation when I can't run,"
Stewart said.
When asked about the case of
Pearl, Stewart stated that t he Jour
nal reporter did not subject him
self to undue risk.
"He was doing his job . . . you
have to take risks reporting in that
sort of environment. . . but I don't
think there's any story worth dying
for," Stewart said.
Stewart was quick to point out

that Pearl was not the first journal
ist to die covering the war in
Afghanistan. He said journalists
die every year covering interna
tional and domestic conllicts. The
Pearl incident does not serve as a
significant wake-up call for re
porters because the deaths of jour
nalists have become relatively fre
quent occurrences, according to
Stewart.
The prevalence of violence
committed against journalists has
led many observers to ask why re
porters do not take further mea
sures to protect themselves, such
as carrying firearms, wearing
Hack jackets and being escorted

by gunmen.
"I think it's a bad idea to have
bodyguards, to wear protective
gear 01 to carry a firearm," Stewart
said. "It's an affront to the ob
servers you interview because they
want protection as well but they
often can't afford it.
"Bodyguards 110 longer make
you a neutral observer of the
conflict because witnesses don't
know who they're talking to.
You're there as a reporter, not as
a player in the conflict, and car
rying a weapon destroys your
credibility."
