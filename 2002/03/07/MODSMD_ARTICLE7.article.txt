# Stewart discusses risks of journalism
## AP reporter recalls the gun wound he received in Sierra Leone 
### NAEL FAKHRY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The recent kidnapping and murder
of Daniel Pearl '85, a Wall Street Journal
reporter, has raised a host of questions
on how journalists covering conflicts
should deal with the threat of violence.
Lan Stewart, currently one of 20
Knight Fellows at Stanford, has experi
enced firsthand the risks of covering con
flicts abroad. As a reporter for the Associ
ated Press since 1995, Stewart has cov
ered Afghanistan, Pakistan, Vietnam,
Laos and most recently West and Central
Africa.
On Jan. 10, 1999, while covering a
rebel uprising in Freetown, Sierra

Leone, Stewart and his convoy were am
bushed by a group of rebels. A photog
rapher and a TV cameraman report ing
for the AP were also in Stewart's car at
the time.
"A rebel jumped in front of our car
and basically unloaded his gun at us,"
Stewart said. "He put one bullet through
the center of my forehead."
The cameraman, Myles Tirney, was
sitting directly adjacent to Stewart, and
he received multiple gunshots to the
chest and one to the head. He died on
the scene, while Stewart was airlifted to a
local hospital. The bullet that hit Stewart
traveled through the middle of his brain
and lodged at the back of his brain. It was
surgically removed 36 hours later.
"I was initially given a 20 percent
chance of surviving," Stewart said. "It's a
miracle that I made it.
"We were reporting on efforts by the
government to bring stability to the city
after a rebel assault. I suppose we looked

like a threat because we may have looked
like European mercenaries."
At the time of the ambush, Stewart
was traveling with a government convoy
that was busy recovering corpses follow
ing clashes between rebel forces and
Sierra Leone's government troops. The
attacker who killed Stewart's colleague
and nearly took Stewart's life was killed
immediately by government soldiers.
Initially, the left side of Stewart's body
was paralyzed, but he has since made sig
nificant progress toward recovery.
Today, he has use of his left leg, while his
left arm remains essentially functionless.
In spite of these traumatic events,
Stewart emphasized that, if he were ca
pable, he would love to return to the
Ivory Coast and continue as a journalist
in the region.
"If I had the physical means, I'd go
back in a second ... but it would be fool-
