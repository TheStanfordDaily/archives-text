KZSU Stanford 90.1fm presents Indiecent Exposure
a night of indie rock at the coffee house!
the lineup: The Swords Project
With a sound dubbed "orchestral post rock", this 7 piece ensemble creates
graceful, pretty songs that at times sound more like chamber music than
rock & roll, bringing to mind groups like Rachel's & Godspeed You Black Emperor.
The Jim Yoshii Pileup
These local indie rockers play melancholy ballads that range from hushed
lulls to tragic climaxes. Reference points: Bedhead, Mogwai.
the lowdown: TUESDAY, MARCH 12th / Stanford Coffee House / 9pm
