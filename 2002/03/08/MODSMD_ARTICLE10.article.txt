Q: Why do we have so many different col
ors of squirrels on campus? Are they
freaks of nature or refugees from a science
lab?
A:Just like people, squirrels come in many
different shapes and sizes. Squirrels of one
species tend to differ from squirrels of another.
There are grey squirrels, euro red squirrels,
black squirrels, northern and southern flying
squirrels, fox squirrels, antelope squirrels — the
list could go on forever. But here's what's sur
prising: you can find euro red squirrels in Japan,
grey squirrels can be black, black squirrels can be
red ... you get the point.
Squirrel descriptions in books usually list the
most common color, size and characteristics for
a given species.
Most squirrels of any species are of some
earth tone, for camouflage purposes. An ani
mal's environment is often most important in
determining what the camouflage looks like,
because the easiest way for an animal to camou
flage is to match the color of its surroundings.

Furry animals, for example, can produce
colors via microscopic physical structures that
are part of their fur. Essentially, these struc
tures act like prisms, refracting and scattering
visible light so tfiat a certain combination ofcol
ors are reflected. When light shines on the
hairs, each hair slightly bends it. This bounces
the light around so that some goes to the sur
face of the skin and the rest is deflected, pro
ducing grey, brown or other colorations.
Species develop camouflage coloration
gradually, through a process of natural selec
tion. In the wild, an individual squirrel that
closely matches its surroundings is more likely
to be overlooked by predators and thus lives
longer and produces more offspring than an
animal that does not match.
Ihe carru>w 112 lage squirrel's offspring will prob
ably inherit similar coloration — also living
longer and reproducing more —so that the

species eventually develops the ideal coloration
for surviving in its particular environment.
The structure of the outer covering may also
evolve to create better camouflage. For exam
ple, squirrel fur is fairly rough and uneven, re
sembling the texture of tree bark. Squirrels
have even developed "counter-shading," with
gray or brown fur on top and white fur on their
underside.
Dark top fur makes it harder for predators
to see squirrels on the ground, while white belly
fur helps squirrels blend in with the sky when
perched in trees.
However, genetic mutations can result in
variations within a species, such as black off
spring from brown parents. The melanistic
morph is very common — melanism is an "over
abundance" of melanin pigment that makes an
animal abnormally dark. Albino squirrels have a
similar condition, but with a lack of melanin.
Therefore, a black or albino squirrel can be
found within almost any species. In nature, an
unusually colored squirrel might be weeded out
through the process of natural selection. But on
campus we see them all, probably because the
only predators the strange black squirrels have
to worry about are out-of-control bicycle riders.
