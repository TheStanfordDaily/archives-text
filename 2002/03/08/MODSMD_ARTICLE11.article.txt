# Athletes start petition
## 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One hundred twelve student
athletes recently signed a petition
calling for the University to join
I he Worker Right s Consortium, a
non-profit organization.
The WR( 1 ensures that factories
that produce clothing and other
goods for universities adhere to
certain codes of conduct that re
spect the rights of its workers.
Unlike previous petitions, it
does not call for the revocation of
the multi-million contract with
Nike, which was renewed in fall
2001. Instead, the petition wants
Stanford to hold "corporate al
liances such as Nike to the same
ethical standards it espouses in the
Fundamental Standard," accord
ing to an advertisement sponsored
by five student-athletes and run in
the Daily last Thursday.
"With my past experience, I've
noticed that student-athletes
aren't apathetic about things,"
said Tiffany Chao, one of five stu
dent-athletes who signed the ad.
"It's just time constraints like
practice and schoolwork. The rea
son why our petition has support
is because it's an easy way for ath
letes to get involved."
In addition to student-athletes
signing the petition, the campus
was invited to sign it this past Mon
day in White Plaza, but the signing
was canceled at the last minute.
The petition seems to have
gone largely unnoticed by the ad
ministration, and Provost John
Etchemendy said that the petition
was a surprise to him.
"Basically, the University only
joins organizations when they rep
resent our own core interests,
namely education and research,"
Etchemendy said. "In fact, we have
a policy against joining organiza

tions that have other purposes."
In addition, Director of Athlet
ics Ted Leland was unavailable
for comment.
The leaders of the petition
point out that while the Nike
contract is worth about $2 mil
lion, the athletic department
raised $28 million last year, more
than any other school in the Pa
cific 10 Conference.
"The Nike contract is helpful
and saves us money, but we make
more than enough money to cover
our own expenses," Chao said.
A few faculty members are also
sympathetic to the petition.
"I cannot for the life of me fig
ure out why Stanford is not a
leader in [this issue]," said Rush
Rehm, associate professor of
drama and classics. "It's the hard
est for [student-athletes] to act be
cause they're the most affected."
Chao also emphasized how rea
sonable this petition is, compared
with those from years past.
"There was an attempt to stop
the Nike contract altogether last
year, but this petition is not as
drastic," she said. "1 feel that it's a
very middle-of-the-road petition,
since the demands aren't as heavy
as previous ones.
Stanford is currently a member
of the Fair Labor Association code
of conduct, but some people com
plain that the association is biased
because corporate representatives
sit on its board of directors.
According to Etchemendy, the
decision to renew the Nike con
tract was not a hasty one.
"We did extensive research into
the Nike standards and code of
conduct, and we're satisfied that
they are a leader in the industry,"
he said.
