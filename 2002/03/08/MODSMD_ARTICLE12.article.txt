# Abortion bill passes

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Leg
islation that would end a type of
late-term abortion in Virginia
cleared (he state Senate yesterday
and is bound for Gov. Mark R.
Warner's desk.
1 he Senate voted 26-12 for Del.
Robert G. Marshall's bill to bar
what it terms "medically induced
infanticide," a measure that abor
tion rights groups say is an uncon
stitutional effort to block a rarely
used abortion procedure.
"I am very pleased with that de
cision." said Marshall, R-Prince
William, the I louse's most outspo
ken abortion opponent.
The bill resembles a 1998 Vir
ginia law that banned a late-term
procedure that abortion oppo
nents denounce as "partial-birth
abortion." That law was voided by
a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that struck down a similar Nebras
ka law as unconstitutional.
With the procedure reclassified
as infanticide, Marshall believes the
court will view the bill differently.
As passed, the legislation would
punish doctors who violate it with
nnes up to $100,000and lo years
in prison. It grants exceptions only
when a pregnancy puts a woman at
serious risk of death or "irre
versible impairment of a major
bodily function."
Women could not be prosecut
ed under the bill.
Bennet Greenberg, a lobbyist

for Planned Parenthood Advo
cates of Virginia, said so restrictive
an exception would not be found
constitutional.
"This bill is absolutely unconsti
tutional. We have had legislative
experts take a look at it and I only
feel stronger now," Greenberg
said, promising a court fight if the
bill becomes law.
The bill passed after it was
stripped of a Senate Courts of Jus
tice amendment that would have
granted doctors far more discre
tion over when to do the proce
dure. It would have allowed them
to proceed if, in their "good faith
medical judgment," they deem it
necessary to protect the life and
health of the patient.
Senators also rejected a floor
amendment by Sen. Roscoe
Reynolds, D-Henry County, that
would have also relaxed the ex
emption.
"I know that some think that an
unconstitutional law is what the
Senate of Virginia ought to pass.
Some of those folks are in favor of
that measure and some of those
folks are opposed to that measure.
But each of us took an oath to enact
legislation that iS constitutional,"
Reynolds said.
Marshall said his bill is defen
sible because it is much more spe
cific and narrowly tailored than
the law the Supreme Court
struck down.
