## The
						Stanford Daily Community already satisfied with Treehouse

Published Since 1891

Of the 1078 students surveyed by the
ASSU's Tresidder Advisory Board,
over 760 responded to questions
about food, service, pricing and at
mosphere at the Treehouse by saying they
were either "mostly satisfied" or "completely
satisfied" with the current restaurant.
These results were instrumental in the Uni
versity's decision to extend the restaurant's
lease through September 2006. We applaud
the Advisory Board and the University for so
liciting and acting on student input in renew
ing the Treehouse's lease.
Yet we question the validity of the stipula
tions the Board imposed on the Treehouse,
which theoretically require it to diversify its
menu, offer more low-price food options and
make enhancements to the facility. The pro
posals seem to lack justification, as the majori
ty of survey respondents saying they would
prefer to "keep the Treehouse as is."

In light of the survey results, it seems that a
better resolution would have been to simply
approve the lease renewal and applaud the
restaurant's management for its stellar work.
The Board's recommendations sound non
controversial — who wouldn't like lower
prices and a wider variety? — but, if followed
by the Treehouse, they could ultimately result
in a degradation of the eating experience.
First, there is a reason why restaurants gen
erally focus on a single type of food: It is efficient
to do so. As a primarily Mexican restaurant, The
Treehouse could direct all its energy and re
sources into producing high-quality burritos,
nachos and guacamole at a reasonable price. It
is unrealistic to expect that the same restaurant
could provide equally high-quality Mexican
food while also making pizzas, stir-fries and bar
bequed ribs, while also doing so at lower or sim
ilar prices.
Ray Klein, owner of the Treehouse, claims

that the increased volume of customers
brought in by the new offerings will allow the
restaurant to cover the cost of producing them.
If this is true, it is hard to fathom how the lim
ited space available will comfortably accommo
date the influx of customers, considering the
fact that the room is already overcrowded dur
ing peak hours.
Furthermore, the Treehouse risks losing its
character if it attempts to provide a broad amal
gamation of different tastes and styles. The cur
rent staff knows how to run a good Mexican
restaurant, but that doesn't mean it would know
how to run a good Asian or Italian restaurant,
and it doesn't imply that it could run a good
restaurant combining all three styles and more.
Setting aside the impracticability of the
changes, survey respondents direcdy indicat
ed that they preferred the Treehouse in its cur
rent form, a result that would seem to mandate
that it not have its menu overhauled by inulti-

pie waves of alternative menu items.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said, "It is clear
that students, faculty and staff wanted the
Treehouse to remain in Tresidder, with some
improvements." Yet far more survey respon
dents said they would prefer keeping the lree
house as is than said they would prefer making
changes. Thus, if the Advisory Board and its
chair, ASSU Senator Michael Osofsky, were
concerned only with what the student popula
tion thought, they would not have needed to
push for any major changes.
While the changes described above are
apparently what the Advisory Board and the
University had in mind in extending the
lease, the above considerations may be moot:
There is no clause in the contract that gives
the University the power to terminate the
lease if the Treehouse fails to make the
