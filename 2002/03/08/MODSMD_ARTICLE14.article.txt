## Can I have a heart? 
### 
In January, an inmate of the Califor
nia prison system received a heart
transplant at Stanford Medical
Center. The man is in the middle of
a 14-year sentence for robbery, his sec
ond conviction, and his receiving a trans
plant touched off a heated debate over
the allocation of organs.
According to the United Network for
Organ Sharing, there are over 4,100 peo
ple in America on the heart transplant
waiting list. Of those, about 700 will die
this year. There are almost 80,000 Amer
icans waiting for an organ of some type or

another.
When the inmate re
ceived a heart trans
plant, many raised com
plaints about the cost —
which, over time, could
add up to $1 million —
to California taxpayers.
The bigger issue to con
sider, though, should be
the fact that when the in-

mate received the transplant, someone
else did not, and thus came a step closer
to death.
Mike Miraglia is one man for whom
death comes a step closer every day. He
shared a room with the convict in the hos
pital. He would have received the heart,
except that he had just had another op
eration when the organ became available.
Was Miraglia upset that a precious,
life-saving heart went to a repeat felon?
No. He sees it as a purely medical deci
sion that rightly did not make value judg
ments.
Many professional ethicists share Mi
raglia's point of view, arguing that medi
cal need should be the only criterion used
in determining who gets an organ, and
various court rulings have established the
responsibility of the state to provide med
ical care to inmates.
That's not the only view out there,
though. Evidence that Chinese authori
ties time executions to match transplan
tation surgeries has prompted legislation
to be introduced in Congress that would
ban Chinese physicians from coming to
the U.S. for transplantation surgery
training.
In most cases, the ethicists are proba
bly right, and those who argue that the
state should refuse to pay for expensive
medical procedures ignore the fact that
to not do so would be to turn a prison sen
tence into a death sentence. But there has
to be a line.
Already, exceptions have been made
to the general rule of giving the organ
to the person it can help the most. Fol
lowing controversy over Mickey Man
tle and Larry Hagman receiving liver
transplants, it was determined in 19%
that people with liver failure brought
on by alcoholism or drug abuse would
not be at the top of the liver waiting

list. Value judgments do play a role in
that guideline. Why not in others?
Should a prisoner who is going to be
executed be eligible for transplants? How
about one who isn't on death row, but
committed an atrocious crime like mur
der? Has he forfeited the privilege of re
ceiving an organ over someone else? An
extreme case: II Osama bin Laden is
caught, does he have the right to get on
the kidney waiting list?
Another question society has got to an
swer is why an inmate can get a trans
plant without worrying about the cost,
while a law-abiding citizen cannot.
The recent movie "John Q" has
brought this question to the forefront of
the national consciousness. In the film, a
father takes an emergency room
hostage when he is told that the hospital
will not put his son on the transplant
waiting list until it is paid $250,000 —
money which John's insurance company
refuses to cover.
A man featured in media stories
prompted by the movie is Frank Selgado.
The 41-year-old sufferer of congestive
heart failure wears a pager so that he can
be alerted the moment the heart that
could save his life becomes available. At
first, he was not able to get onto the wait
ing list, as his insurance company can
celled his policy and he (lid not have the
$150,000 needed.
He correctly points out in interviews
that it would have made a lot of sense for
him to try robbing a bank. If he got away
with it, he'd have the money he needed;
if was caught, then he'd go to prison
where the state would have to cover his
costs.
Some in the medical community argue
that people do not stay off the waiting lists
for lack of money, that hospitals provide
creative funding options and that charity
is available (there are no widely accepted
numbers on the latter). And Selgado was
able to finally get on the list by obtaining
money through fundraisers.
But there's something messed up with
a system where any convict can get a new
organ paid for by the state, but a hard
working, law-abiding worker can legally
be denied a slot on the waiting list due to
insufficient current financial means. The
latter scenario may be (and hopefully is)
rare, but health-care institutions — if
they want to avoid a socialist system, and
if they want to be ethical — ought not let
it happen at all.
To the question of how to allocate or
gans, there isa simple solution within our
reach: Just give an organ to whoever
needs one.
Well over two million Americans die
every year. Crude as it sounds, if we get
our donor act together, organ availability
really shouldn't be a problem. There
