American ideals, not policies, brought
about Sept. 11 attacks
To paraphrase a classic film, David
Chan (see Wednesday's Daijvljhas com
mitted one of the classic blunders of the
political left — that it is American foreign
policy "hypocrisy" which is responsible
for the attacks of Sept. 11.
He invokes the usual litany of wrongs
committed by America against the world
— economic sanctions against Iraq,
American support for Israel, even U.S.
repudiation of the Kyoto Accord — and
supposes that these policies are responsi
ble for the anti-American sentiment put
so horrifyingly on display in the Sept. 11
attacks.
All these criticisms are arguably valid. I
will not dispute that our policies towards
Iraq are flawed and self-defeating, nor
that our support for Israel deserves close
scrutiny in light of the recent flare-up of vi
olence in the Middle East. But there is all
the difference in the world between the
policy disagreements between the U.S.
and the world in these areas, and the viru
lent hatred which Osama bin Laden and
the al-Qaida network espouse.
Yes, Europe is a little wary of us after
our erratic foreign policy shifts under
President George W. Bush. But bin Laden
and his supporters struck the United
States not because of our refusal to sign in
ternational treaties, but because the Unit
ed States (and, in fact, the entire western

world) poses a fundamental threat to his
dreams of Islamic theocracy, and a way of
life reminiscent of the 12th century — no
learning, no open thought, no dissent
from orthodoxy and no freedom.
al-Qaida sought then and seeks still to
establish a world run by the Taliban, a
world which none of us would want to
live in. And frighteningly enough, this is
a world which a surprisingly large num
ber of people hope to build. The power,
prosperity and freedom of the West are
what extremists like bin Laden fear —
because they represent a highly palat
able alternative to the medievalism he
hopes to re-establish.
And though we may dismiss Bush's
comical blusterings about the "axis of
evil", no one should deny that at the
heart of his rantings lies a kernel of
truth — it was our ideals, not our poli
cies, which brought about these attacks
and motivates al-Qaida to fight us.
These terrorists seek to weaken a nation
which) for all its terrible flaws and
hypocrisies, still idealizes and symbol
izes human freedom — an ideal which
the terrorists would like nothing better
than to destroy.
And they perceive that as long as the
United States remains a world power, for
better or for worse, that freedom is what
we will represent to the world — even if
we behave at times like a "rogue state". If
Chan were to become president today
and implement the foreign policy he de

sires, I have no doubt whatsoever that bin
Laden would smile at the news, nod to his
associates, and then send his operatives
to crash another four planes into another
four buildings tomorrow morning.
The World Trade Center fell and the
Pentagon burned not because of what we
have done, but because of who we are
and what we believe in. Because we stand
opposed to the medieval world that the
terrorists want.
So should we change our foreign pol
icy towards Iraq? Yes. Should we sign ac
cords upholding human rights? Certain
ly. Should we do something to stop rising
carbon dioxide emissions? Of course.
But should we expect that to bring an
end to the terrorist threat? Absolutely
not. Doing something to end the brutal
Israeli-Palestinian conflict will certainly
help our cause, as would a more sensible
policy to help democratize the Middle
East rather than coddle dictators in
Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I agree with Mr. Chan that these are
urgent changes we must make in our
policies, if we want to fight the social and
economic .despair that lies at the heart of
the Middle East and feeds the terror. But
Mr. Chan should not confuse his guilt
over American foreign policy mistakes
with the hatred of human freedom
which drove terrorists to commit the
atrocities of Sept. 11.

and implement the foreign policy he de

sires, I have no doubt whatsoever that bin
Laden would smile at the news, nod to his
associates, and then send his operatives
to crash another four planes into another
four buildings tomorrow morning.
The World Trade Center fell and the
Pentagon burned not because of what we
have done, but because of who we are
and what we believe in. Because we stand
opposed to the medieval world that the
terrorists want.
So should we change our foreign pol
icy towards Iraq? Yes. Should we sign ac
cords upholding human rights? Certain
ly. Should we do something to stop rising
carbon dioxide emissions? Of course.
But should we expect that to bring an
end to the terrorist threat? Absolutely
not. Doing something to end the brutal
Israeli-Palestinian conflict will certainly
help our cause, as would a more sensible
policy to help democratize the Middle
East rather than coddle dictators in
Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I agree with Mr. Chan that these are
urgent changes we must make in our
policies, if we want to fight the social and
economic .despair that lies at the heart of
the Middle East and feeds the terror. But
Mr. Chan should not confuse his guilt
over American foreign policy mistakes
with the hatred of human freedom
which drove terrorists to commit the
atrocities of Sept. 11.
