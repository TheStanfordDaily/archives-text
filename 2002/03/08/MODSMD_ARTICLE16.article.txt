## Trojans destroy Card in Pac-10 quarterfinal 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
LOS ANGELES — No wonder Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery was never
in favor of a Pacific 10 Conference Tour
nament.. This was about as had as it gets.
I here is no question that now is not the
time to rebuild. But after yesterday's 103-
78 loss to No. 22 Southern California in
the first round oil he Pac-10 Tournament,
the Cardinal will have to do just that.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Thursday: No. 22 Southern Califor
nia 103, No. 16 Stanford 78, Pac-10
Tournament quarterfinal.

Before yesterday, everybody had
known that USC was quicker, stronger,
bigger and more athletic than the Cardi
nal. But it's finally safe to say that USC is
just plain better. By a mile.
Whatever the No. Hi Cardinal did at
the Staples Center, it wasn't good
enough. And even though Stanford
knew exactly what to expect, it couldn't
do anything to stop it.
Thett-pointers kept coming from Tro
jan forward David Bluthenthal.
1 he follow-up shots and layups from
junior guard Desmon Farmer never
stopped.
I lie fade-away baseline jumpers from
senior forward Sam (llancy were a living
nightmare.
And that was just on the defensive end

of the ball.
Add the Trojans' smothering lull
court press, their blistering half-court de
fense and a dominating presence inside
the key, and there was no question that
the Cardinal couldn't keep up.
Whenever Stanford Finally got a stop,
the Trojans countered with a stop of
their own.
So for the third time this season, Stan
ford was outplayed by USC and it was
outshot. It was simply out-everythinged.
"I wish I had answers," Montgomery
said. "We had no answers for USC
today. They had great performances
across the board. We felt like we were
prepared, but obviously USC is a diffi
cult matchup for us."
No kidding.
While Trojan freshman guard Jerry
DuPree was making acrobatic shots over
three Cardinal defenders, Stanford's
players were missing easy layups and tip
ins. And while Trojan senior point guard
Brandon Granville was knocking down
perimeter shots with ease, the Cardinal
struggled just to get the ball over the half
court line.
Stanford couldn't shoot, it couldn't de
fend and, who knows, it might have even
struggled to get through security at the
airport on the way home.
The Trojans shot 55 percent for the
game and held the Cardinal to only 29 of
76 from the field.

16 Stanford's 103-78 loss to the No. 22 Trojans in the quarterfinals of the
Pac-10 Tournament last night in Los Angeles.
Defensively, if the Cardinal fo
cused on guarding the perimeter,
the Trojans went inside with four
straight layups in the first half.
When Stanford finally focused on
the inside, the Trojans went to the
perimeter, as shown by four
straight jump shots, two of which

were 3-pointers, that gave USC a
30-18 lead.
Then after falling behind by 25
with seven minutes left, all Mont
gomery could do was try to rally
his troops in order to gain some
momentum for next week. Even
that didn't work.
The Cardinal allowed USC to
run its lead to 30 points with three
minutes remaining, and the Tro
jans held on fora 25-point victory.
Was there any bright side to the

trip to L.A.? Maybe. One day of
tournament experience and just
two days of missed classes.
While the players might be more
prepared for finals, they might also
have a lack of confidence heading
into the "Big Dance."
The loss does give this wounded
Cardinal team three much-need
ed days to recover from their
bruises and strains.
The Cardinal will find out Sun
day who it will face in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament.
One can only hope that a
matchup with the Trojans is not in
the Cardinal's NCAA future.
The defeat also answered the
question of whether havingjunior
center Curtis Borchardt in the
game would help. It didn't.
Although Borchardt had an im
pact inside the key, tallying his
15th double-double of the season
with 17 points and 14 rebounds,
the Trojans consistently double
and triple-teamed the big man,
forcing him to rely on a supporting
cast that just didn't support.
Junior swingman Casey Jacob
sen was only 7 for 18 from the field
and didn't score his first 3-pointer
until there was five minutes left in
the game.
Junior guard Julius Barnes
only scored four points.
Freshman swingman Josh
Childress, Borchardt and Jacob
sen each turned the ball over
three times.
And as a team, Stanford turned
the ball over 19 times.
"We created a lot of pressure
and kept it on them. We didn't let
them get any looks," USC coach
Henry Bibby said.
Is there any solace?
Clancy, who was named the Pac
-10 Player of the Year on Wednes
day, and Bibby both said that it was
the best offensive game the Trojans
had all season. In some ways, the
Cardinal might have been a victim
of spectacular play.
But not according to Borchardt.
"They flat-out kicked our
butts," Borchardt said.

Senior guard Tony Giovacchini runs into USC forward Sam Clancy in No.
16 Stanford's 103-78 loss to the No. 22 Trojans in the quarterfinals of the
Pac-10 Tournament last night in Los Angeles.
Defensively, if the Cardinal fo
cused on guarding the perimeter,
the Trojans went inside with four
straight layups in the first half.
When Stanford finally focused on
the inside, the Trojans went to the
perimeter, as shown by four
straight jump shots, two of which

were 3-pointers, that gave USC a
30-18 lead.
Then after falling behind by 25
with seven minutes left, all Mont
gomery could do was try to rally
his troops in order to gain some
momentum for next week. Even
that didn't work.
The Cardinal allowed USC to
run its lead to 30 points with three
minutes remaining, and the Tro
jans held on fora 25-point victory.
Was there any bright side to the

trip to L.A.? Maybe. One day of
tournament experience and just
two days of missed classes.
While the players might be more
prepared for finals, they might also
have a lack of confidence heading
into the "Big Dance."
The loss does give this wounded
Cardinal team three much-need
ed days to recover from their
bruises and strains.
The Cardinal will find out Sun
day who it will face in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament.
One can only hope that a
matchup with the Trojans is not in
the Cardinal's NCAA future.
The defeat also answered the
question of whether havingjunior
center Curtis Borchardt in the
game would help. It didn't.
Although Borchardt had an im
pact inside the key, tallying his
15th double-double of the season
with 17 points and 14 rebounds,
the Trojans consistently double
and triple-teamed the big man,
forcing him to rely on a supporting
cast that just didn't support.
Junior swingman Casey Jacob
sen was only 7 for 18 from the field
and didn't score his first 3-pointer
until there was five minutes left in
the game.
Junior guard Julius Barnes
only scored four points.
Freshman swingman Josh
Childress, Borchardt and Jacob
sen each turned the ball over
three times.
And as a team, Stanford turned
the ball over 19 times.
"We created a lot of pressure
and kept it on them. We didn't let
them get any looks," USC coach
Henry Bibby said.
Is there any solace?
Clancy, who was named the Pac
-10 Player of the Year on Wednes
day, and Bibby both said that it was
the best offensive game the Trojans
had all season. In some ways, the
Cardinal might have been a victim
of spectacular play.
But not according to Borchardt.
"They flat-out kicked our
butts," Borchardt said.

LOS ANGELES — No wonder Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery was never
in favor of a Pacific 10 Conference Tour
nament.. This was about as had as it gets.
I here is no question that now is not the
time to rebuild. But after yesterday's 103-
78 loss to No. 22 Southern California in
the first round oil he Pac-10 Tournament,
the Cardinal will have to do just that.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Thursday: No. 22 Southern Califor
nia 103, No. 16 Stanford 78, Pac-10
Tournament quarterfinal.

Before yesterday, everybody had
known that USC was quicker, stronger,
bigger and more athletic than the Cardi
nal. But it's finally safe to say that USC is
just plain better. By a mile.
Whatever the No. Hi Cardinal did at
the Staples Center, it wasn't good
enough. And even though Stanford
knew exactly what to expect, it couldn't
do anything to stop it.
Thett-pointers kept coming from Tro
jan forward David Bluthenthal.
1 he follow-up shots and layups from
junior guard Desmon Farmer never
stopped.
I lie fade-away baseline jumpers from
senior forward Sam (llancy were a living
nightmare.
And that was just on the defensive end

of the ball.
Add the Trojans' smothering lull
court press, their blistering half-court de
fense and a dominating presence inside
the key, and there was no question that
the Cardinal couldn't keep up.
Whenever Stanford Finally got a stop,
the Trojans countered with a stop of
their own.
So for the third time this season, Stan
ford was outplayed by USC and it was
outshot. It was simply out-everythinged.
"I wish I had answers," Montgomery
said. "We had no answers for USC
today. They had great performances
across the board. We felt like we were
prepared, but obviously USC is a diffi
cult matchup for us."
No kidding.
While Trojan freshman guard Jerry
DuPree was making acrobatic shots over
three Cardinal defenders, Stanford's
players were missing easy layups and tip
ins. And while Trojan senior point guard
Brandon Granville was knocking down
perimeter shots with ease, the Cardinal
struggled just to get the ball over the half
court line.
Stanford couldn't shoot, it couldn't de
fend and, who knows, it might have even
struggled to get through security at the
airport on the way home.
The Trojans shot 55 percent for the
game and held the Cardinal to only 29 of
76 from the field.
