## Trojans destroy Card in Pac-10 quarterfinal 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
LOS ANGELES â€” No wonder Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery was never
in favor of a Pacific 10 Conference Tour
nament.. This was about as had as it gets.
I here is no question that now is not the
time to rebuild. But after yesterday's 103-
78 loss to No. 22 Southern California in
the first round oil he Pac-10 Tournament,
the Cardinal will have to do just that.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Thursday: No. 22 Southern Califor
nia 103, No. 16 Stanford 78, Pac-10
Tournament quarterfinal.

Before yesterday, everybody had
known that USC was quicker, stronger,
bigger and more athletic than the Cardi
nal. But it's finally safe to say that USC is
just plain better. By a mile.
Whatever the No. Hi Cardinal did at
the Staples Center, it wasn't good
enough. And even though Stanford
knew exactly what to expect, it couldn't
do anything to stop it.
Thett-pointers kept coming from Tro
jan forward David Bluthenthal.
1 he follow-up shots and layups from
junior guard Desmon Farmer never
stopped.
I lie fade-away baseline jumpers from
senior forward Sam (llancy were a living
nightmare.
And that was just on the defensive end

of the ball.
Add the Trojans' smothering lull
court press, their blistering half-court de
fense and a dominating presence inside
the key, and there was no question that
the Cardinal couldn't keep up.
Whenever Stanford Finally got a stop,
the Trojans countered with a stop of
their own.
So for the third time this season, Stan
ford was outplayed by USC and it was
outshot. It was simply out-everythinged.
"I wish I had answers," Montgomery
said. "We had no answers for USC
today. They had great performances
across the board. We felt like we were
prepared, but obviously USC is a diffi
cult matchup for us."
No kidding.
While Trojan freshman guard Jerry
DuPree was making acrobatic shots over
three Cardinal defenders, Stanford's
players were missing easy layups and tip
ins. And while Trojan senior point guard
Brandon Granville was knocking down
perimeter shots with ease, the Cardinal
struggled just to get the ball over the half
court line.
Stanford couldn't shoot, it couldn't de
fend and, who knows, it might have even
struggled to get through security at the
airport on the way home.
The Trojans shot 55 percent for the
game and held the Cardinal to only 29 of
76 from the field.
