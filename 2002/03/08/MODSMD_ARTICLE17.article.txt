# No. 7 volleyball squeaks by Tritons
## 
### KATRINA LAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team has hit the point in its season
where a win is a win and how it wins
isn't so important anymore.
The No. 7 Cardinal (1 1-7, 10-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) traveled south for what was
supposed to be an easy mid-week
conference matchup with last-place
UC-San Diego(3-14,1-13).
Comparing Stanford's recent
high-profile matches — a 3-1
upset of No. I UCLA on Feb. Hi
and a narrow five-game loss to
then-No. I Pepperdine the next
weekend —to UC-San Diego's
season-long spat of quick, decisive
losses, one would be tempted to
write off the Tritons before the
match even started.
But after blowing a two-game
lead to an unusually consistent
and motivated UC-San Diego
squad, Stanford found itself grate
ful to be getting out of RIMAC
Arena with a narrow five-game
win (30-28, 30-25, 25-30, 27-30,
15-8).
The match got off to a dubious
start as the Cardinal and the Tri
tons posted miserable .222 and .200
hitting percentages, respectively, in
Stanford's 30-28 opening-game
victory.
Though Stanford hit well above
.300 for the remainder of the
match, losses in the third and
fourth games put Stanford on the
brink of becoming only the second
team to fall to U( '.-San I )iego in con
ference play this year.
"We relaxed a little too much
and they never gave up," said Stan-

Stanford wraps up its next-to
last road trip of the regular season
as it heads south to No. 10 UC-

"Irvine is playing really well; They
are fighting fora play-off spot and

On Saturday, Stanford will face
top-ranked UCLA in a highly antici

pated rematch.
The last time the Cardinal played
at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins pulled
out a narrow 3-2 marathon win in the
first round of last year's MPSF tour
nament, bringing Stanford's season
to an end. The Cardinal had defeat
ed UCLA in both their regular sea
son meetings.
UCLA will again be looking for
retribution at Pauley after last
month's loss to Stanford at Burn
ham Pavilion.
Saturday's game will be a preview
of the intense matchups to come with

the MPSF and NCAA tournaments
rapidly approaching.
In light of its record, Stanford is
not a likely candidate for the one at
large berth in the four-team NCAA
tournament in May, pinning Stan
ford's national championship hopes
entirely on winning next month's
conference tournament.
Stanford currently occupies
fourth place in the conference
standings. If the Cardinal can
maintain its current standing, it
will get to host its first round match
in the MPSF tournament.

losses, one would be tempted to
write off the Tritons before the

But after blowing a two-game
lead to an unusually consistent
and motivated UC-San Diego
squad, Stanford found itself grate

Arena with a narrow five-game
win (30-28, 30-25, 25-30, 27-30,
15-8).
The match got off to a dubious
start as the Cardinal and the Tri
tons posted miserable .222 and .200
hitting percentages, respectively, in
Stanford's 30-28 opening-game
victory.
Though Stanford hit well above
.300 for the remainder of the
match, losses in the third and
fourth games put Stanford on the

team to fall to U( '.-San I )iego in con

Stanford wraps up its next-to

On Saturday, Stanford will face
top-ranked UCLA in a highly antici

pated rematch.
The last time the Cardinal played
at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins pulled
out a narrow 3-2 marathon win in the
first round of last year's MPSF tour
nament, bringing Stanford's season
to an end. The Cardinal had defeat

son meetings.
UCLA will again be looking for
retribution at Pauley after last

Saturday's game will be a preview
of the intense matchups to come with

the MPSF and NCAA tournaments
rapidly approaching.
In light of its record, Stanford is
not a likely candidate for the one at
large berth in the four-team NCAA
tournament in May, pinning Stan
ford's national championship hopes
entirely on winning next month's
conference tournament.
Stanford currently occupies
fourth place in the conference
standings. If the Cardinal can
maintain its current standing, it
will get to host its first round match
in the MPSF tournament.

The Stanford men's volleyball
team has hit the point in its season
where a win is a win and how it wins
isn't so important anymore.
The No. 7 Cardinal (1 1-7, 10-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) traveled south for what was
supposed to be an easy mid-week
conference matchup with last-place
UC-San Diego(3-14,1-13).
Comparing Stanford's recent
high-profile matches — a 3-1
upset of No. I UCLA on Feb. Hi
and a narrow five-game loss to
then-No. I Pepperdine the next
weekend —to UC-San Diego's
season-long spat of quick, decisive
losses, one would be tempted to
write off the Tritons before the
match even started.
