# SC turns neutral site to home court
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the Southern California players began to rally
the crowd, throwing their fists in the air, waving
Gatorade towels around, tailing for the audience's
support, something became apparent. Not only did
the Trojans receive the higher seed, but they were
also the hometown favorite.
The small contingent of Cardinal alumni support
was negated by a sea of burgundy and gold.
There were no Dollies.
No band chants.
No dancing Tree.
Even the vendors were against Stanford, selling
misprinted signs reading "Go Cardinals" before the
start of the game.
And the camera crew even played into this home
court disadvantage by putting shot after shot of USG
fans and toddlers clad in mini-Trojan cheerleading
outfits on the Staples Center Jumbotron to rile the
USC troops.
Stanford had no backing.
The Cardinal knew from the very beginning that
it it was going to win this game, it would have to do
it on its own.
And it became painfully apparent as the game
wore on that if Stanford is going to have any success
in the postseason, the Cardinal is going to have to
adopt that "us against the world" mentality that has
motivated so many teams in the past.
Neutrality.is a word that holds much more mean
ing now. USC didn't earn home-court advantage,
but it got it anyway.
"The fans came out tonight and it was really ex
citing," said USC guard Brandon Granville. "We
feed off that energy, which is why we've been so suc
cessful at home."
