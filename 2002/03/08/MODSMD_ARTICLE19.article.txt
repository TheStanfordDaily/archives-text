# SC turns neutral site to home court
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the Southern California players began to rally
the crowd, throwing their fists in the air, waving
Gatorade towels around, tailing for the audience's
support, something became apparent. Not only did
the Trojans receive the higher seed, but they were
also the hometown favorite.
The small contingent of Cardinal alumni support
was negated by a sea of burgundy and gold.
There were no Dollies.
No band chants.
No dancing Tree.
Even the vendors were against Stanford, selling
misprinted signs reading "Go Cardinals" before the
start of the game.
And the camera crew even played into this home
court disadvantage by putting shot after shot of USG
fans and toddlers clad in mini-Trojan cheerleading
outfits on the Staples Center Jumbotron to rile the
USC troops.
Stanford had no backing.
The Cardinal knew from the very beginning that
it it was going to win this game, it would have to do
it on its own.
And it became painfully apparent as the game
wore on that if Stanford is going to have any success
in the postseason, the Cardinal is going to have to
adopt that "us against the world" mentality that has
motivated so many teams in the past.
Neutrality.is a word that holds much more mean
ing now. USC didn't earn home-court advantage,
but it got it anyway.
"The fans came out tonight and it was really ex
citing," said USC guard Brandon Granville. "We
feed off that energy, which is why we've been so suc
cessful at home."
But the Trojans weren't play
ing at home.
T he Cardinal's home-court
disadvantage was partly compli
cated by the justifiable, but un
timely absence of the band. Hope
fully the New Tree Inaugural Ball
was worth it.
And the Cardinal's decision
not to practice at Staples on Tues
day might have also had an effect.
"We felt a day of class and stay
ing around Tuesday night was
important," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "It did
not make a lot of sense for us to fly
down Tuesday night for an hour
practice. It's hard on the kids [to
be away from school]."
With all that said, USC simply
outplayed the Cardinal. And it
wasn't so much due to a lack of
hustle by the Cardinal, but the
raw athletic talent on Henry
Bibbv's roster.

"This is probably the best of
fensive game we've played all
year," Bibby said.
Who would've thought the
Trojans could do this to the Car
dinal again?
For the third time this season
the USC trap proved to be Stan
ford's Achilles' heel. The Trojan
defense was suffocating as usual,
and for the third time this season
it seemed as though USC couldn't
miss.
While Stanford struggled of
fensively to break the press, USC]
pushed the ball up the floor, scor
ing easy layups and hitting shot
after shot.
"We had no answers for USC
today," Montgomery said. "They
were the aggressor and had great
performances across the board.
"Obviously, USC] is a very diffi
cult matchup for us. They are the
better team. There's no question
about the outcome of the game.
But I'm still disappointed. I
thought we could compete better
than that."
The Trojans walked into the

locket room at halftime up by 17
points on 07 percent shooting
from the field and only seven
forced turnovers.
"This first game [against
USC] was about the toughest
game we could've had in all ac
tuality," Montgomery said. "I
don't think that we had a lack of
enthusiasm about wanting to
play in this tournament, but we
just got outplayed."
The Trojans went on a 20-9
run beginning in the 14th minute
of play and led by as many as 23
points in the first hall.
Stanford's shooting woes con
tinued into the second half, as
USC handed Stanford another
heartwrenching loss.
Newly named Pac-10 Player
of the Year Sam Clancy flashed
his pearly whites with five min
utes left to play as he looked up
to find his team leading by 28
points with no Stanford come
back in sight.
He left the game to a standing
ovation from the Trojan-domi
nated Staples crowd.

But the Trojans weren't play
ing at home.
T he Cardinal's home-court
disadvantage was partly compli
cated by the justifiable, but un
timely absence of the band. Hope
fully the New Tree Inaugural Ball
was worth it.
And the Cardinal's decision
not to practice at Staples on Tues
day might have also had an effect.
"We felt a day of class and stay
ing around Tuesday night was
important," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "It did
not make a lot of sense for us to fly
down Tuesday night for an hour
practice. It's hard on the kids [to
be away from school]."
With all that said, USC simply
outplayed the Cardinal. And it
wasn't so much due to a lack of
hustle by the Cardinal, but the
raw athletic talent on Henry
Bibbv's roster.

"This is probably the best of
fensive game we've played all
year," Bibby said.
Who would've thought the
Trojans could do this to the Car
dinal again?
For the third time this season
the USC trap proved to be Stan
ford's Achilles' heel. The Trojan
defense was suffocating as usual,
and for the third time this season
it seemed as though USC couldn't
miss.
While Stanford struggled of
fensively to break the press, USC]
pushed the ball up the floor, scor
ing easy layups and hitting shot
after shot.
"We had no answers for USC
today," Montgomery said. "They
were the aggressor and had great
performances across the board.
"Obviously, USC] is a very diffi
cult matchup for us. They are the
better team. There's no question
about the outcome of the game.
But I'm still disappointed. I
thought we could compete better
than that."
The Trojans walked into the

locket room at halftime up by 17
points on 07 percent shooting
from the field and only seven
forced turnovers.
"This first game [against
USC] was about the toughest
game we could've had in all ac
tuality," Montgomery said. "I
don't think that we had a lack of
enthusiasm about wanting to
play in this tournament, but we
just got outplayed."
The Trojans went on a 20-9
run beginning in the 14th minute
of play and led by as many as 23
points in the first hall.
Stanford's shooting woes con
tinued into the second half, as
USC handed Stanford another
heartwrenching loss.
Newly named Pac-10 Player
of the Year Sam Clancy flashed
his pearly whites with five min
utes left to play as he looked up
to find his team leading by 28
points with no Stanford come
back in sight.
He left the game to a standing
ovation from the Trojan-domi
nated Staples crowd.
