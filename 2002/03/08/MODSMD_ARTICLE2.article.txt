# Treehouse will stay
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Dean of Students Marc VVais
announced yesterday that the
University has extended the
Treehouse's lease through Sep
tember 2006. This contract re
newal was contingent upon the
Treehouse agreeing to make sev
eral changes to its operation, in
cluding widening its menu vari
ety, enhancing its facilities and
offering lower-cost meals.
Earlier this year, the Tresid
der Advisory Board, a group that
evaluates Tresidder vendors and
their contracts, conducted a cam
pus-vvicle survey to determine
whether the University should
keep the Treehouse or bring in
another restaurant.
After compiling the results of
the survey, completed by over
1,000 students, faculty and staff,
the board unanimously recom
mended to Wais on Feb. 26 that
the University extend the Tree
house's lease if the restaurant
agreed to make changes based
on the feedback from (he survey.
Wais brought this recommen
dation to Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Gene Awakuni, and
on March 4, Stanford Manage
ment Company signed the con
tract extension with Treehouse
owner Ray Klein.
The survey results showed
overwhelming satisfaction with
the Treehouse. Of the respon
dents, 77 percent said they were
"mostly satisfied" or "completely
satisfied" with the food. Seventy

percent and 75 percent said they
felt similarly about the pricing
and atmosphere, respectively.
"It is clear that students, fac
ulty and staff wanted the free
house to remain in Tresidder,
with some improvements," Wais
said in a press release. "We look
forward to working with the
Treehouse management in serv
ing the needs of the Stanford
community."
Changes to the Treehouse will
be implemented almost immedi
ately, including menu shifts and
an influx of Stanford memorabil
ia to adorn the establishment.
"Starting this spring quarter,
we'll see the first wave of food
changes," said junior Michael
Osofsky, the student chair of the
advisory board.
There is no formal process in
place to implement the changes
suggested by the advisory board.
"It's an informal process, and
a lot of it is still in the works," Os
ofsky said.
Osofsky, who will be aiding
Klein in making the adaptations
to the Treehouse, said that he
and Klein will proceed in phases.
The first phase will include in
corporating more Thai and Chi
nese dishes into the menu. Many
of the recipes will come from the
Palo Alto restaurant The New
Bamboo, which Klein also owns.
To make these additions,
some of the Mexican dishes the
Treehouse offers will be cut from
the menu, but both Osofsky and

The Treehouse received an extension on its lease after agreeing to make
changes to its operations. It received positive feedback from students and
other customers in a survey conducted by the Tressider Advisory Board.
Klein insisted that patrons' favorite
dishes will remain untouched.
Another aim of the changes is to
add new, less expensive items to the
Treehouse's menu.
"We're going to try to do more
menu items under the $5 range,"

Klein said. "And wc won't sacrifice
any of the quality we're known for."
Klein said he also hopes to add
more vegetarian items to the menu
as well.
Despite simultaneously increas
ing menu variety and lowering
prices, Klein does not anticipate
that this will have a negative effect
on profits.
"We find that as we add new
things and broaden our customer

base, our volume goes up," he said,
explaining that he expects the in
crease in patronage to account for
the smaller profit they receive from
each sale.
Student reaction to the changes
was mixed. Some students fear that
incorporating such dilferent foods
into the menu will detract from the
feeling of the Treehouse.
"I think of a Mexican place as
kind of its style," said graduate stu

dent Byron Wang. "If it is half-Asian
and half-Mexican, I'll probably just
go somewhere else," he said.
Others felt that a change in
prices and menu additions was
overdue.
"The price is not marketed to
students," said coterminal student
Jim Lovette, who says lie eats at
the Treehouse at least once a day.
"I mean, this is not downtown
Palo Alto."
