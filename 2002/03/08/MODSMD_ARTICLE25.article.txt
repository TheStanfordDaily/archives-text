match play last weekend to compete in
the Pacific Coast Men's Doubles Champi
onships. Stanford's last set of dual
matches were against Santa Clara and
Utah on Feb. 25-26, during which the
Cardinal steamrolled its opponents by a
combined 13-1 margin.
"Arizona and Arizona Suite lie some
where between Cal and Utah," said head
coach Dick Gould. "[The matches] will be

good for us at the end of the quarter to
keep us sharp."
Arizona (7-4), the more inexperienced
of the two teams, has shown some fight
ing potential. Last Monday the Wildcats
snapped a four-match slide with a con
vincing 6-1 victory over Loyola Mary
mount. Although Arizona fields a rela
tively young team, 55th-ranked senior
Steven Capriati — younger brother of
professional women's player Jennifer —
lends his vast experience to the rest of the
Wildcat squad.
Arizona State (6-2), although ranked
only five spots higher than its cross-state
rival, is a much more dangerous squad and
has the larger potential for an upset.
The Sun Devils just wrapped up their
second straight shutout with a 7-0 mauling
of San Diego on Wednesday. week,

Arizona State handed Arizona an embar
rassing 7-0 loss in front of a large Wildcat
home crowd in Tucson. Although Arizona
State does not have any players ranked in
the top 100, the Sun Devils have consis
tently applied coordinated teamwork to
pull out wins.
"These are the last two matches of the
quarter, and hopefully we'll go out on a
couple of wins before the start of the Pac
-10 season," said junior Scott Lipsky.
Having taken some time off after the
Pacific Coast Championship, the team is
ready to meet whatever challenges the
two Arizona schools might bring.
"I was pleased with the doubles play last
week, and I saw tremendous improve
ment," said (iould." But a match is a match,
and the guys can always learn one or two
things."

The latest rankings released this week
shuffled Stanford players around the top
of the board. Stanford's dynamic doubles
duo of l.ipsky and junior David Martin
moved up one place to take the top spot
away from UCLA's j. Jean Rojer and
Marcin Matkowski. This marks' the
team's first No. 1 ranking.
Senior K.J. Hippensteel lost his No. 1
singles ranking as a result of his Feb. 23 loss
to John Paul Fruttero of California. Hip
pensteel had held the top ranking since
Dec. 11 of last year.
In the team rankings, Stanford moved
up one spot to No. 2. Illinois, which lost on
Monday to No. 14 Duke, fell from the top
spot to No. 5. Georgia currently holds the
No. 1 ranking, with No. 3 Southern Cali
fornia and No. 4 UCLA rounding out the
top five.
