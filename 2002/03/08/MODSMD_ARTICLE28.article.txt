# ACT play lacks right 'Spirit'

### RAPHAEL GINSBURG 
Though ihe Ameri
can Conservatory The
ater billed its new pro
duction of Noel Cow
ard's "Blithe Spirit" as
"innovative," it is hard to
see what is original or
even exciting about
Charles Randolph-

Wright's interpretation
of this classic comedy. Indeed, what seems to
be the director's only innovation — choos
ing two African-American actors as the leads
— flops; Gregory Wallace and Shona Tuck
er are the low points of the production. In
Randolph-Wright's hands, the play, which
should sparkle and shimmer, was often
amusing, yet lacked the characteristic edge
that distinguishes Coward.
"Blithe Spirit," like all of Coward's
plays, is set in (and pokes fun at) the world
of the English aristocracy. Charles Con
domine (Wallace) is a mystery novel au
thor. He and his second wife, Ruth ( Fuck
er), invite a quirky medium, Madame Ar
cati (Lori Larsen), to conduct a seance and
thus unwittingly provide material for
Charles' new book. Much to their dismay,
Madame Arcati accidentally conjures up
Charles' first wife, Elvira (Rene Augesen),
who can only be seen by Charles.
The "blithe spirit" lives up to her name,
toying with (Charles and harassing Ruth. She
ends up killing Ruth accidentally in an at
tempt to kill Charles and thus win him back.
In a scene of hilarious farce, Madame Arcati
is summoned to dematerialize Elvira, briefly
bringing Ruth's spirit back before she even
tually rids Charles of both ghosts.

production are Wallace and Tucker's per
formances. Wallace tries too hard to make

Charles suave and,irrev
erent. Like his charac
ter, he expects us to love
him in spite of himself.
He uses the same into
nation and phrasing for
nearly every sentence;
he treats each line mere
ly as material to fit to his
mold of words alternate-

ly stretched into an aristocratic drawl and
spit out disdainfully. On several occa
sions, I doubted his ability as an actor
even more seriously; his actions when he
first sees Elvira's ghost (stopping mid
stride, dropping his glass and stuttering)
were unpolished and childish.
Tucker, on the other hand, executes the
farcical aspects of her part well. Though
many of her lities are delivered rather dully,
she is saved by Coward's excellent writing.
However, like Wallace, her rendition of the
play's melodramatic sections is dull and flat.
If the leads are what drag this production
down, it is the supporting actors who save it.
Indeed, Larsen's performance as Madame
Arcati makes the play worth seeing. Between
her whimsical body comedy and orange
hair, one can't help but be reminded of Lu
cille Ball. She perfectly portrays the spacey,
energized medium, who is aptly described
by Elvira as "absolutely dotty." I ler perfect
comic intonation is a sharp contrast to Wal
lace's performance.
Augesen also gives a superlative perfor
mance as Elvira. She creates a character who
is at times pouty, temperamental, flirtatious,
seductive and sly, yet constantly maintains
the playful nature that makes Elvira such a
wonderful character. She is given some of

the best lines of the play ("If it's a ghost, 1
shall scream"), and her delivery never dis
appoints. Also notable are Jessica Turner as
the mousy, flighty maid, Edith and Joan
Harris-Gelb as the ditzy neighbor, Mrs.
Bradman.
Randolph-Wright's direction is, for the
most part, traditional; he maintains the
original setting of the English countryside.
His only unique contribution (besides song
and dance interludes between scenes which,

while enjoyable, are hardly remarkable) is
his idea of portraying Charles as an African-
American writer in exile, which seems hard
ly appropriate. No matter, though, for it
seems to have no effect at all on Wallace's
performance.
Overall, one can't help but feel let down
by this production. After all. this is the play
famous for lifting the spirits of the war
wear)'and depressed Britishin 1941; surely
Randolph-Wright could have done better.
