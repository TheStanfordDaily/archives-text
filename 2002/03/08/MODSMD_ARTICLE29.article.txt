While Hollywood's recent romantic
comedies have been characterized by
sweet but boring boy-meets-girl storylines
(see "Serendipity"), Bombay's newest
films are productions of epic proportions.

They throw gigantic ensemble casts into
confusing four-hour mazes of gratuitous
drama, wild plot twists and song-and
dance medleys in the most wonderfully
predictable places.
Likewise, while traditional American
weddings are characterized by good man

ners and banal conversation, traditional
Indian weddings are noisy, exhilarating af
fairs that are culminated not in a moment
of marriage vows, but in weeks and weeks
of flirtatious courtship, garish parties and
lavishly dispensed money.
Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding" em
braces the best of Indian popular culture
and rejects the worst — for the most part.
She gives us the wedding but leaves out the
two extra hours of film; she gives us the
gratuitous romance but leaves out the gra
tuitous motorcycle accidents.
"Monsoon Wedding" takes place dur
ing New Delhi's balmy, lusty monsoon sea
son. Here, our familiar red roses are re
placed with garlands of Indian marigolds;
our white-painted gazebo is swapped fora
good-natured parachute of a tent, colored
in fiery red and orange. The wedding re
ception itself takes place during one of the
monsoon season's spontaneous down
pours — which only makes the partygoers
dance with even more abandon.
The young, ambitious cast further in
tensifies the visual richness of "Monsoon
Wedding." The women act beautifully; the
men are beautiful. Shefali Shetty textures
the film's overall lightness with a strong
performance as Ria, the unmarried cousin
of the bride, who throws a harsh light on
the decadent wedding when she reveals a
dark secret at the end. Indian pop star Va
sundhara Das plays an ingenue-with-a
twist role that rivals the recent debut of
America's own pop-icon ingenue, Britney
"Not Yet A Woman" Spears. And the
groom (Parvin Dabas) is gorgeous, as is the
young, unmarried Rahul Chadha (Ran
deep Hooda), a Sydney college student
who has returned to India after years away.
At times, though, the heavy drama and

simplistic humor typical of India's Bolly
wood industry seeps into Monsoon Wed
ding. During a pre-wedding make-out ses
sion with her ex-boyfriend (in the back seat
of a Jeep, no less), bride-to-be Aditi is
pulled over by the police and dragged
away, kicking and screaming, for "indecent
exposure" — while the creepy ex
boyfriend answers a cell phone call. A
minor storyline involving a blossoming re
lationship between the wedding planner,
P.K.. Dube (Vijay Raaz) and the Verma
family's maid, Alice (Tilotama Shome), is
recounted in an overly comic manner — as
though the less wealthy in this gathering of
wedding-goers deserve less respect from
us, the audience.

Considering its diverse influences,
Monsoon Wedding could be tagged in one
of two ways: as an American film with an
Indian heart, or as an Indian film with an
American sensibility. In fact, both descrip
tions would be accurate — and at the same
time, filmmakers in either hemisphere
would have a hard time claiming full cred
it for this movie. That may be why Mira
Nair's latest production has such universal
appeal. With the help of a talented ensem
ble cast, she makes a sprightly landing
somewhere in between Hollywood and
Bollywood, ending up with a rich, ambi
tious comedy that is, in the end, complete
ly original.
