### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
He's a writer, a producer, a di
rector and commonly appears in
movies as "Silent Bob," but last
night, amid a full house of over 500
people Kevin Smith was all but
silent. Smith spoke last night at
Kresge Auditorium at an event
sponsored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
Smith's talk was an informal
question-and-answer session with
a strong comical twist. This was
"his first West-coast college ap
pearance in a number of years,"
according to Bill Falsey, the Speak
ers Bureau director.
"[l] don't have a lecture, [and I]
don't have anything prepared,"
Smith said. "It'sjust Q and A."
Smith appears in some of his
films as the silent sidekick of the
foul-mouthed Jay, played by Jason
Mewes.
"Why did yon choose to be the
only character in your movie that
doesn't speak?" an audience mem
ber asked.
"I'm not an actor," Smith
humbly responded. "I can't mem
orize all this dialogue."
An audience member asked
Smith what he thought about film
schools, particularly one in Van
couver, BC.
"My best advice is [to] chum
up with people who are in film
school," Smith said. "Forget
film school, particulary the one
in Vancouver."
Smith said that film theory de
tracts from what he believes to be a
film's main objective: the expres
sion of oneself .
He responded favorably to a

question regarding digital movies:
"I think everybody should be able
to do it. . . we all should be able to
express ourselves."
Smith gained interest in film
making after watching the 1991
movie "Slacker."
"No main character, no plot,
no car crash, no monkey . . .
and this counts as a movie?"
Smith said. "That's what got me
off and made me want to be
come a filmmaker."
He was asked about what in

spired him to make "Dogma," one
of his latest movies.
"Growing up Catholic," Smith
said. "I believe in God, I just don't
believe in the institution any
more."
He commented on issues they
had with the Catholic League
while making "Dogma."
"The Catholic League got hip to
the movie," Smith said. "Stuff was
taken out of context. . . but at the
end of the day the movie is very
pro-faith."

Smith's films have become a
type of therapy, where issues from
his past come to the surface.
When asked about the refer
ence to "Stilt Wars" in his latest
movie, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back," Smith discussed his interest
in the sci-fi c lassic.
"1 liked 'Star Wars,'" Smith re
sponded. "It was kind of fun to talk
aboutâ€”l just put it in there be
cause 1 kind of dug it."

Kevin Smith, actor and director of such movie hits as "Dogma," "Clerks" and "Mallrats" speaks last night in Kresge
Auditorium. Smith did not lecture, but instead fielded questions from the crowd.
When questions shifted toward
controversy between him and
Planet of the Apes director Tim
Burton, he freely made his share
of quips.
"Tim Burton said my name?"
Smith said. "I love Batman...but
Burton can't tell a story."
He spoke about what he would

say if he ever met Jesus Christ.
"[I would say,] 'I hope you have a
great sense of humor,'" Smith
joked.
He also talked about his long
time best friend and star of
Dogma, Ben Affleck.
"1 love [Aflleck]," Smith said. "I
would put him in every
movie...he's really talented."
Smith said his future plans in
clude making the "Clerks" cartoon
movie by 2004, and a film starring
Affleck later this year.
