# Singer shows you how to 'Laugh'
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
Keller Williams' new CD, "Laugh," is aptly titled. It
could be called "Smile" too, but that's kind of cheesy. And
for all of the elements that Williams blends into his brand
of funky folk rock, cheese is definitely not one of them.
This is the sixth album for Williams, a native of Virgina
who has been wowing audiences live for years now. He has
gained underground noteriety for his amazing one-man

shows, where he plays no
fewer than eight guitars,
and uses live looping tech
nology to add harmonies,
bass lines, percussion, and
other assorted sounds into
his mix.
With "Laugh," a studio
album, we don't get to hear

his live magic where he does everything himself. Instead,
his excellent guitar skills and quirky lyrics take center stage
here, as he recruits a talented slew of fellow musicians to
play his background instruments (including Tye North
and David Watts).
Simply put. "Laugh" is just a good time. There's nothing
here that will change the world, but the enjoyment that
Williams radiates in his material rubs of! on us, his listen
ers. Always one for the silly lyric, Williams delivers some
zingers on "Laugh." Take "One Hit Wonder," for exam-

pie, where he sarcastically quips "Oh to be a one hit won
der / That would be oh so superb / Only fifteen minutes or
so / In and out and nobody gets hurt." And then, "I'll be
gone before you know / In my private Lear/No second

chance /1 don't want to blow it / Dis
appear / To my never ending luau /
In fifteen years/ VH-1 where are
they now?" (Who else would have
thought of "luau" for that rhyme?).

Unfortunately, as the
album progresses, some of
the songs begin to sound
alike. Oh, and there's a well
intentioned but slightly-off
cover of Atii l)ifranco's
"Freakshow." Hut those side
steps are redeemed not only
by the better of the vocal

songs, such as "One Hit Wonder"
and "Vabeeotchay," but also by the
instrumental — Ihe unsung (no
pun intended) heroes of "Laugh."
Here, Williams' fine instrumental
skills are head-on in the spotlight.
And through it all, Williams en
joys himself. He makes us want to
enjoy it too. Perhaps Williams' mis
sion statement for "Laugh" can be

found in the lyrics for "Gallivanting": "Gnats are guiding
Gnawing, gliding / Gorgeously gallivanting / Generously
giving and granting." Keller Williams' latest should give
you a good "Laugh," and some smiles too.
