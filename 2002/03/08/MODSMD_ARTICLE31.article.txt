# Reynolds rises above dog testicles
## 
### MARIKA KNOWLES 
Bawdy bathroom humor redeemed by an uplifting
moral message seems to be the gist of "National Lam
poon's Van Wilder," which opens nationwide on April 5.
Ryan Reynolds, the star of the film, who I interviewed
last week in San Francisco, says that the film makes time
to be "broad." It is telling that when I first listened to my
tape-recording of the interview, 1 thought that by
"broad," Reynolds was referring to a particular type of
expansive sexual humor in which women are termed as
"broads," a term that connotes coarseness and crudity.
However, this was not the case. Reynolds used "broad"
to refer to the film's "broader moments," in which the
movie supposedly departed from such ticklish jokes as a
dog with gigantic testicles, to expound on the value of
philosophical tidbits like "living life with no boundaries."
The result of these departures is to allow the film to
spring between two extremes of un-originality: tasteless,
middle-school humor and self-help morality.
On the other hand, the film could be viewed as mock
ing of this very morality, just as Chevy Chase's earlier Na
tional Lampoon films made happy-go-lucky parodies of
family values. While I reluctantly approve of the film as a
sort of neo-Animal House reform venture, in which the
frat boys of "Animal House" suffer the revenge of the ris
ing, polyester-shirt-wearing alternative Van Wilder, 1
cannot vouch for the film as a convincing attempt to dis
cuss serious moral messages.
The film chronicles the story of a college student
chronically unable to graduate from college, who stays
on at Coolidge College to throw excellent parties and
to help less fortunate students gain acceptance and
cool points.
Tara Reicl plays Gwen, Van Wilder's love-interest, a
student journalist who has none of the usual handicaps,
like glasses and a ponytail, of the conventional "uncon
ventional" female love interest. In this respect, the film
dumbs down a dumb trope — the cool guy being at
tracted to the uncool or "quirky" girl with a metaphor
ical paint splash on her overalls. Reid lacks the paint
splash and seems the obvious choice for Van's wander
ing affection.
Despite his character's lack of definition, however,
Reynolds is the one thing that manages to stay afloat
amidst the film's confusion of eclairs encrusted with canine
semen and sexually rapacious hair-piece-wearing guid
ance counselors. Reynolds is a graceful star who handles
some of the film's worst moments — like when pooch's
buoyant testicles pop up out of a hot tub into Van Wilder's
face — with just the right bit of ironic distance.
Reynolds' biggest career moment before "National
Lampoon" was the TV sitcom "Two Guys and a Girl,"
which was recently canceled but fairly popular. He's
gorgeous on screen, although I didn't quite sense the
out-of-tbis-world comic timing that the press pack laud
ed him for.

Reynold's greatest skill seems to be the ability to float
above and beyond a poor movie by simply raising his eye
brows at every bad joke, a quality he shares with Chevy
Chase. On that note, it's amazing how much bathroom
humor that "Caddyshack" was able to get away with —
the candy bar-shit in the pool — that "Van Wilder" just
can't seem to carry successfully.
When 1 spoke with Reynolds last week in San Francis
co, lie discussed the film eagerly and seemed conscious of
its problems. Ryan wore a hip ensemble of pin-striped
dark denim jeans, a short-sleeved white shirt and an ar
gyle sweater vest.
INTERMISSION: What are your long-term career
goals? l)o you want to keep on doing the kind of comedy
you were doing in "National Lampoon"?
REYNOLDS: Well, I don't think anybody wants to do
that. Obviously I want to have a well-rounded career. I'm
not going to try to franchise this movie or anything like
that. People judge comedy in some different category
than acting. I mean I'm playing a fucking role like I
would any other role. 1 read it; this is my interpretation
of it. My long-term goals are to continue to act, not to
continue to be funny.
The last three movies I've made have been stuff that
I'm very proud of and that I've worked hard on and that
1 think have a diversity. If you were to put them all back
to-back, I'd like to think that a lot of people wouldn't
know it was the same person. The last thing I did before
this one I was 20 pounds heavier and had a beard down
to my neck. So it's kind of fun to lose yourself in those
things, but I'm not one of those actors who wants to be a
chameleon, or anything like that. I'd like you to be able
to tell it was the same person.
INTERMISSION: What's the difference for you be
tween improv comedy and stage acting. Do you prefer
one or the other?
REYNOLDS: I think being on stage is more of an imme
diate gratification obviously than being on film. In com
edy especially you're surrounded by a whole crew and,
although it's fun to hear, there's a lot of stifled laughter.
I like people to be able to express themselves however
they want right then and there. But working on a film
yon can create a reality that you could never ever repro
duce in front of live people.
INTERMISSION: Have you ever had any really terrible
experiences as an improv comic?
REYNOLDS: Oh my god, yes. I can't think of too many
incidents that have been horrible, but I mean you get
that hot face and your ears are burning and you're sweat
ing. We've all experienced it, whether you're at a party or
on a stage in front of 1,000 people, I mean it's all the
same thing. It sucks. The worst experience I've ever had:
John Laroquette show, I played his son, we went up in
front of the live audience, and I couldn't remember my
own name, let alone my lines. I just died; I literally just
died out there. I cannot think of a more perfunctorily

terrible feeling than when 1 walked out on that stage to
deliver my first line, and I had looked at it backstage 100
times and it wouldn't stay in my head, it's the worst feel
ing on earth.
INTERMISSION: So why did you decide to pursue a ca
reer in film and TV as opposed to improv comedy?
REYNOLDS: Money. You can't even make a living, I
couldn't support myself doing improv comedy. It's right
along the same lines as playing old Bryan Adams songs
on the street fora crowd of four. It doesn't add up.
INTERMISSION: What do you think about Van
Wilder's philosophy of life, you know, living life with no
judgements, living life in the present. .. ?
REYNOLDS: I think they're words to live by, I mean I
think those moments in the film are certainly more valu
able than a breast joke. I think the movie's strong point is
pace, finding the right moments to be broad, trying, in this
sort of genre, which can be sort of a cheap-shot genre,
finding some ways to earn, if I may say so, those broader
moments. That's the most valuable thing in the movie.

ed him for.

Reynold's greatest skill seems to be the ability to float
above and beyond a poor movie by simply raising his eye
brows at every bad joke, a quality he shares with Chevy
Chase. On that note, it's amazing how much bathroom
humor that "Caddyshack" was able to get away with —
the candy bar-shit in the pool — that "Van Wilder" just
can't seem to carry successfully.
When 1 spoke with Reynolds last week in San Francis
co, lie discussed the film eagerly and seemed conscious of
its problems. Ryan wore a hip ensemble of pin-striped
dark denim jeans, a short-sleeved white shirt and an ar
gyle sweater vest.
INTERMISSION: What are your long-term career
goals? l)o you want to keep on doing the kind of comedy
you were doing in "National Lampoon"?
REYNOLDS: Well, I don't think anybody wants to do
that. Obviously I want to have a well-rounded career. I'm
not going to try to franchise this movie or anything like
that. People judge comedy in some different category
than acting. I mean I'm playing a fucking role like I
would any other role. 1 read it; this is my interpretation
of it. My long-term goals are to continue to act, not to
continue to be funny.
The last three movies I've made have been stuff that
I'm very proud of and that I've worked hard on and that
1 think have a diversity. If you were to put them all back
to-back, I'd like to think that a lot of people wouldn't
know it was the same person. The last thing I did before
this one I was 20 pounds heavier and had a beard down
to my neck. So it's kind of fun to lose yourself in those
things, but I'm not one of those actors who wants to be a
chameleon, or anything like that. I'd like you to be able
to tell it was the same person.
INTERMISSION: What's the difference for you be
tween improv comedy and stage acting. Do you prefer
one or the other?
REYNOLDS: I think being on stage is more of an imme
diate gratification obviously than being on film. In com
edy especially you're surrounded by a whole crew and,
although it's fun to hear, there's a lot of stifled laughter.
I like people to be able to express themselves however
they want right then and there. But working on a film
yon can create a reality that you could never ever repro
duce in front of live people.
INTERMISSION: Have you ever had any really terrible
experiences as an improv comic?
REYNOLDS: Oh my god, yes. I can't think of too many
incidents that have been horrible, but I mean you get
that hot face and your ears are burning and you're sweat
ing. We've all experienced it, whether you're at a party or
on a stage in front of 1,000 people, I mean it's all the
same thing. It sucks. The worst experience I've ever had:
John Laroquette show, I played his son, we went up in
front of the live audience, and I couldn't remember my
own name, let alone my lines. I just died; I literally just
died out there. I cannot think of a more perfunctorily

terrible feeling than when 1 walked out on that stage to
deliver my first line, and I had looked at it backstage 100
times and it wouldn't stay in my head, it's the worst feel
ing on earth.
INTERMISSION: So why did you decide to pursue a ca
reer in film and TV as opposed to improv comedy?
REYNOLDS: Money. You can't even make a living, I
couldn't support myself doing improv comedy. It's right
along the same lines as playing old Bryan Adams songs
on the street fora crowd of four. It doesn't add up.
INTERMISSION: What do you think about Van
Wilder's philosophy of life, you know, living life with no
judgements, living life in the present. .. ?
REYNOLDS: I think they're words to live by, I mean I
think those moments in the film are certainly more valu
able than a breast joke. I think the movie's strong point is
pace, finding the right moments to be broad, trying, in this
sort of genre, which can be sort of a cheap-shot genre,
finding some ways to earn, if I may say so, those broader
moments. That's the most valuable thing in the movie.


Ryan Reynolds is into immediate gratification
Bawdy bathroom humor redeemed by an uplifting
moral message seems to be the gist of "National Lam
poon's Van Wilder," which opens nationwide on April 5.
Ryan Reynolds, the star of the film, who I interviewed
last week in San Francisco, says that the film makes time
to be "broad." It is telling that when I first listened to my
tape-recording of the interview, 1 thought that by
"broad," Reynolds was referring to a particular type of
expansive sexual humor in which women are termed as
"broads," a term that connotes coarseness and crudity.
However, this was not the case. Reynolds used "broad"
to refer to the film's "broader moments," in which the
movie supposedly departed from such ticklish jokes as a
dog with gigantic testicles, to expound on the value of
philosophical tidbits like "living life with no boundaries."
The result of these departures is to allow the film to
spring between two extremes of un-originality: tasteless,
middle-school humor and self-help morality.
On the other hand, the film could be viewed as mock
ing of this very morality, just as Chevy Chase's earlier Na
tional Lampoon films made happy-go-lucky parodies of
family values. While I reluctantly approve of the film as a
sort of neo-Animal House reform venture, in which the
frat boys of "Animal House" suffer the revenge of the ris
ing, polyester-shirt-wearing alternative Van Wilder, 1
cannot vouch for the film as a convincing attempt to dis
cuss serious moral messages.
The film chronicles the story of a college student
chronically unable to graduate from college, who stays
on at Coolidge College to throw excellent parties and
to help less fortunate students gain acceptance and
cool points.
Tara Reicl plays Gwen, Van Wilder's love-interest, a
student journalist who has none of the usual handicaps,
like glasses and a ponytail, of the conventional "uncon
ventional" female love interest. In this respect, the film
dumbs down a dumb trope — the cool guy being at
tracted to the uncool or "quirky" girl with a metaphor
ical paint splash on her overalls. Reid lacks the paint
splash and seems the obvious choice for Van's wander
ing affection.
Despite his character's lack of definition, however,
Reynolds is the one thing that manages to stay afloat
amidst the film's confusion of eclairs encrusted with canine
semen and sexually rapacious hair-piece-wearing guid
ance counselors. Reynolds is a graceful star who handles
some of the film's worst moments — like when pooch's
buoyant testicles pop up out of a hot tub into Van Wilder's
face — with just the right bit of ironic distance.
Reynolds' biggest career moment before "National
Lampoon" was the TV sitcom "Two Guys and a Girl,"
which was recently canceled but fairly popular. He's
gorgeous on screen, although I didn't quite sense the
out-of-tbis-world comic timing that the press pack laud
ed him for.
