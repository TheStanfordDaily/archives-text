# Blackalicious hits the bulls-eye
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
It may have been Joseph Conrad who
wrote, "Imagination, not invention, is the
supreme master of art as life," but that could
just as easily have been a line uttered by Gift
of Gab, lyricist for the hip-hop duo Blackali
cious. Find that hard to believe? Well, Gab
and Chief Xcel (the group's producer)
aren't your typical musicians, and Blackali
cious isn't your typical group.
Blackalicious' first album was about pur
pose; that's what, its title, "Nia," means in
Swahili. The group's newest album, "Blaz
ing Arrow," to be released on April 30, nat
urally takes that theme to a new level.
"Now, we feel purpose is found. 'Blazing
Arrow' is about faith — having the faith to
confront challenges. It's about purpose
manifesting itself," explained Gift of Gab.
It's about more than that, however.
While many of "Blazing Arrow" 's tracks are
laced with a vague universalist spirituality,
the duo's spund is growing to encompass all
sorts of new styles while maintaining the in
fluences and ideals that served as the origi
nal foundation for Blackalicious. In fact, this
record features contributions from Chali
2Na and Cut Chemist (Jurassic 5), Zach De
La Rocha (former frontman of Rage Against
the Machine), Latyrx, Saul Williams, Gil-
Scott Heron, Sean Lennon, Ben Harper
and Miho Hatori (Cibo Matto).
Describing the process of making the
new album. Gab said, "Before we sat down
to make this album, we listened to all the
classics. 'Midnight Marauders,' 'De La
Soul Is Dead.'" While those classic hip-hop
influences are plainly displayed on "Blaz
ing Arrow," the group has a greater mis
sion as well.
"Great music can lilt you, move your
spirit, and that's what we strive to do," Gab
said. In this sense, they hope to replicate the
things that inspired them in the music of
both contemporary artists like Outcast and
Mos Def, as well as pioneers like Curtis May

field and Stevie Wonder.
In light of that, "Blazing Arrow" is a
tremendous success. With an inclusive vi
sion, it exists as a piece of art on several lev
els. As a party record, it moves you just as
hard as A Tribe Called Quest or Funkadel
ic. As a piece of personal reflection, it show
cases the group's uncanny dexterity and in
trospection on tracks like "Aural Pleasure,"
with vocalist jaguar Wright. As a hip-hop
document, it shuts down detractors of Bay
Area performers with songs like "Chemical
Calisthenics," which exhibits Gab's ability to
wrap his tongue around any beat to trans
form his voice into a hip-hop weapon. In its
basic essence, it echoes the work of a past
musical pioneer — Marvin Gaye.
"Blazing Arrow" is Blackalicious' major
label debut, but the group is hopeful that it
can maintain the sort of support that has
been instrumental to its success so far. MCA,
its label, hasn't tried to push its music in any
one direction. Though it's been a couple of
years since "Nia" wowed audiences, Cab
said that he and Xcel never really took much
of a break. "Starting with our first single,
'Swan Lake,' to our EP 'Melodica' to A2G' to
'Nia' to this, its really all one body of work."
That sort of mindset will hopefully make
the transition to this new part of Blackali
cious' musical career smoother. While being
on a major label will certainly help them get
more exposure, the group will continue to
rely on older methods of reaching fans.
College radio, for example, will continue
to be important to the group. "There's no
politics with college radio," Gab reasoned,
"so if your mittic is good, they'll play it. And
we've always been about trying to make
good music."
At KZSU, Stanford's radio station, "Make
You Feel That Way," the first single off the
new album, has consistently appeared
among the top 10 songs played by DJs since
it was released.
Despite that, however, there are very
real challenges facing the twosome as they

attempt to spread word of
their music. Currently, they
are touring the country as
part of the Sno Core 2002
Tour, which also features
San Francisco peers Spear
head, as well as Ozomatli,
Nikka Costa, and saxo
phonist Karl Denson. Play
ing before unresponsive
crowds that have never
heard of you can be some
what unnerving for any
group, as anyone who saw
Blackalicious open for
Common here on campus
last year knows.
Gab acknowledges the
formidable task ahead of
the group as it crisscrosses
the nation, but adds that he
and Xcel "enjoy the chal
lenge. We like trying to win
people over." Playing at
San Francisco's Warfield
Theater on March 1, the
group had it easier than
usual, with the crowd
jumping in sync with Xcel's
beats, bobbing their heads
to Gab's rapid-fire raps and
mouthing the lyrics to

songs from "Nia." "The Bay Area is home,
always will be home and there's nothing
like it," Gab explained.
Though they are fixtures in the Bay
Area scene, as more people around the
country hear the name "Blackalicious,"
Xcel and Gab will be forced to consider
where they fit into the greater hip-hop
community. However, they're careful not
to get too ahead of themselves. "It's some
thing we've thought about, definitely.
Now, though, we're trying to grow, to
evolve as artists," said Gab.
Similarly, on "4000 Miles," Gab sings,
"The final destination used to be my main

question / But then I looked and all I was
searching for was present." Don't be fooled
into thinking that the group is content with
where it is, though.
Take "Passion," for example. This song,
recorded with Rakaa and Babu of Dilated
Peoples, gives a glimpse of the extraordi
nary ambition and energy that burns with
in both groups. Blackalicious' imagination
and potential continue to grow with each
release, proving that the group is part of a
rare breed — never forgetful of music and
influences that first nourished its creativity,
while continually pushing the envelope of
that creativity.

thing we've thought about, definitely.
Now, though, we're trying to grow, to
evolve as artists," said Gab.
Similarly, on "4000 Miles," Gab sings,
"The final destination used to be my main

question / But then I looked and all I was
searching for was present." Don't be fooled
into thinking that the group is content with
where it is, though.
Take "Passion," for example. This song,
recorded with Rakaa and Babu of Dilated
Peoples, gives a glimpse of the extraordi
nary ambition and energy that burns with
in both groups. Blackalicious' imagination
and potential continue to grow with each
release, proving that the group is part of a
rare breed — never forgetful of music and
influences that first nourished its creativity,
while continually pushing the envelope of
that creativity.


Northern California hip-hop heroes, Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel.
It may have been Joseph Conrad who
wrote, "Imagination, not invention, is the
supreme master of art as life," but that could
just as easily have been a line uttered by Gift
of Gab, lyricist for the hip-hop duo Blackali
cious. Find that hard to believe? Well, Gab
and Chief Xcel (the group's producer)
aren't your typical musicians, and Blackali
cious isn't your typical group.
Blackalicious' first album was about pur
pose; that's what, its title, "Nia," means in
Swahili. The group's newest album, "Blaz
ing Arrow," to be released on April 30, nat
urally takes that theme to a new level.
"Now, we feel purpose is found. 'Blazing
Arrow' is about faith — having the faith to
confront challenges. It's about purpose
manifesting itself," explained Gift of Gab.
It's about more than that, however.
While many of "Blazing Arrow" 's tracks are
laced with a vague universalist spirituality,
the duo's spund is growing to encompass all
sorts of new styles while maintaining the in
fluences and ideals that served as the origi
nal foundation for Blackalicious. In fact, this
record features contributions from Chali
2Na and Cut Chemist (Jurassic 5), Zach De
La Rocha (former frontman of Rage Against
the Machine), Latyrx, Saul Williams, Gil-
Scott Heron, Sean Lennon, Ben Harper
and Miho Hatori (Cibo Matto).
Describing the process of making the
new album. Gab said, "Before we sat down
to make this album, we listened to all the
classics. 'Midnight Marauders,' 'De La
Soul Is Dead.'" While those classic hip-hop
influences are plainly displayed on "Blaz
ing Arrow," the group has a greater mis
sion as well.
"Great music can lilt you, move your
spirit, and that's what we strive to do," Gab
said. In this sense, they hope to replicate the
things that inspired them in the music of
both contemporary artists like Outcast and
Mos Def, as well as pioneers like Curtis May

field and Stevie Wonder.
In light of that, "Blazing Arrow" is a
tremendous success. With an inclusive vi
sion, it exists as a piece of art on several lev
els. As a party record, it moves you just as
hard as A Tribe Called Quest or Funkadel
ic. As a piece of personal reflection, it show
cases the group's uncanny dexterity and in
trospection on tracks like "Aural Pleasure,"
with vocalist jaguar Wright. As a hip-hop
document, it shuts down detractors of Bay
Area performers with songs like "Chemical
Calisthenics," which exhibits Gab's ability to
wrap his tongue around any beat to trans
form his voice into a hip-hop weapon. In its
basic essence, it echoes the work of a past
musical pioneer — Marvin Gaye.
"Blazing Arrow" is Blackalicious' major
label debut, but the group is hopeful that it
can maintain the sort of support that has
been instrumental to its success so far. MCA,
its label, hasn't tried to push its music in any
one direction. Though it's been a couple of
years since "Nia" wowed audiences, Cab
said that he and Xcel never really took much
of a break. "Starting with our first single,
'Swan Lake,' to our EP 'Melodica' to A2G' to
'Nia' to this, its really all one body of work."
That sort of mindset will hopefully make
the transition to this new part of Blackali
cious' musical career smoother. While being
on a major label will certainly help them get
more exposure, the group will continue to
rely on older methods of reaching fans.
College radio, for example, will continue
to be important to the group. "There's no
politics with college radio," Gab reasoned,
"so if your mittic is good, they'll play it. And
we've always been about trying to make
good music."
At KZSU, Stanford's radio station, "Make
You Feel That Way," the first single off the
new album, has consistently appeared
among the top 10 songs played by DJs since
it was released.
Despite that, however, there are very
real challenges facing the twosome as they

attempt to spread word of
their music. Currently, they
are touring the country as
part of the Sno Core 2002
Tour, which also features
San Francisco peers Spear
head, as well as Ozomatli,
Nikka Costa, and saxo
phonist Karl Denson. Play
ing before unresponsive
crowds that have never
heard of you can be some
what unnerving for any
group, as anyone who saw
Blackalicious open for
Common here on campus
last year knows.
Gab acknowledges the
formidable task ahead of
the group as it crisscrosses
the nation, but adds that he
and Xcel "enjoy the chal
lenge. We like trying to win
people over." Playing at
San Francisco's Warfield
Theater on March 1, the
group had it easier than
usual, with the crowd
jumping in sync with Xcel's
beats, bobbing their heads
to Gab's rapid-fire raps and
mouthing the lyrics to

songs from "Nia." "The Bay Area is home,
always will be home and there's nothing
like it," Gab explained.
Though they are fixtures in the Bay
Area scene, as more people around the
country hear the name "Blackalicious,"
Xcel and Gab will be forced to consider
where they fit into the greater hip-hop
community. However, they're careful not
to get too ahead of themselves. "It's some
thing we've thought about, definitely.
Now, though, we're trying to grow, to
evolve as artists," said Gab.
