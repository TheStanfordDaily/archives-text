# Custom blends pop-rock drivel
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
Custom's songs are so derivative
he makes the Strokes sound like
groundbreakers. "Fast," the debut
album from this New York City film
maker, a.k.a. Duane Lavold, blends
together just about every style spun
on contemporary alternative, rock
and pop radio.
Combining rap rock, folk, elec
tronic beats and breathy vocals, this
record sounds like a conglomerate of
Sum 41, Pete Yorn, Kid R<xk and
even Soul Coughing.
The opening track, "Beat Me,"
begins with a simple acoustic guitar
over a soft hip hop beat. Had the
song ended after the first 13 seconds,
it would Ik- damn good. But once the
melody starts, listeners will soon re
alize they've heard this all before. It's
called Beck. But minus the talent

and irreverence that made the songwriter the
'90s slacker spokesperson.
"Beat Me" 's background "woo woos" al
most save the song, but they can't quite over
shadow Custom's flow. The singer's rhyming
recalls the worst of rap rock — stale and un
interesting lyrics and a boring and repetitive
acoustic guitar.
The song, much like the entire album, bor
ders on the ridiculous as the songwriter con
tinually shifts genres both between songs and
within them. Ben Folds does something simi
lar on the single from his latest album,
"Rockin' the Suburbs." However, Folds'ssong
is parody and thus funny. Custom's songs fail
to bridge gaps, so they instead achieve a kind
of unintentional hilarity.
Custom received his most publicity about a
year ago when MTV refused to air his single
"Hey Mister" on Total Request Live. Accord
ing to Rolling Stone Online, the network
banned the video because it contained obscene
shots of women. Video aside, the song contains

the tasteful line, "Hey mister /1 really like your daughter / I'd
like to eat her like ice cream and clip her in chocolate." Re
cently, MTV has actually screened the video, and DJs have
played the single on alternative rock radio.

Each of the record's 13
songs does have its high
lights. For example, the cho
rus harmony in "One Day,"
the background "why, oh
why"sin "Streets" and the
drum sound on "Daddy" to
name a few. But Custom's
melodies disable any merit
his songs may have.

Custom first recorded music when he needed a soundtrack

man Michael Hutchence and has yet to be released.
Instead of listening to Custom's genre crossing, simply
checkout what he's imitating. Begin with Beck. For alternative
folk, look up Joseph Arthur and foj alternative rock, ask about
Firewater. And if it must be rap-rock, just play "Nookie" on re
peat. Excluding Beck, each of these artists specialize in a style
