# Azure Ray lights up Noise Pop
## 
### KIM SAMEK 
You have to be pretty damn good to si
lence a whole audience at a large festival as
a relatively unknown acoustic act.
Last Saturday at Cafe du Nord, Maria
Taylor and Orenda Fink along with new
keyboardist Jackie Lyons captivated the
crowd with their breathtaking melodies.
Singers / guitarists / songwriters Taylor and
Fink sat side by side, guitar necks pointed in
opposite directions. The sold-out crowd,
comprised largely of concert-goers who had
a general week-long festival pass, appropri
ately sat cross-legged on the floor as the girls
launched into their half-hour-long set.
An Azure Ray concert is like no other be
cause the ballads are so slow and moving.
You see the group live to listen closely and
not simply to have an evening out. You
move at its pace for awhile, wondering why
Fink's face is always almost completely ob
scured by her hair as she quietly picks away
at her guitar, or why Taylor sports a pensive
melancholy, wishing you could have what
they have.
I'd have to say that Azure Ray is one of
the most under-appreciated bands 1 have
ever come across. An electronic (keyboards,
not guitars)-acoustic band that hails from
Athens, C ia., its members display a talent for
music you don't normally see these days.
Each of them is proficient in several instru
ments, and boy do they ever use them. Last
year at Noise Pop, they opened for Bright
Eyes and Mark Eitzel. They're touring
members of Bright Eyes, one of their many
musical projects. Fink even played trumpet
in one of the rounds of musical chairs of
each song, after playing bass, keyboards and
guitar.
Founding members Fink and Taylor met

in high school and have played in various
bands since then. As they were first starting
out in Birmingham, Ala., their talent was rec
ognized by current Elektra artists Remy Zero.
"Back then, in the Remy Zero days, what
we did was really bad!" Fink said laughing
ly. "But they for some reason encouraged
us. They set us up with our first practice
space and recording our first songs."
Since then, they have played in an up
beat rock band Little Red Rocket until about
a year and a half ago, when they formed
Azure Ray. They decided to go fora softer
and sadder approach because it reflected
where they were at the time.
"We went through some things that

bununed us out, and we started
writing some of these songs that
were different," explained Fink.
"We wrote these other cathartic
songs which we kept to our
selves for awhile, but then we
decided to play an acoustic show
and played a song, and then
Brian from [the record label]
Warm offered to make a record
of them. We just kept writing
along that style and realized it's
the direction we needed to go
in."
Athens-based Warm Elec
tronic: put out their self-titled
debut album last year. Their
most recent release, a six-song
EP entitled "November" which
came out (ironically) in January
2002, was released on Saddle
Creek, however. Saddle Creek's
claims to fame include Bright
Eyes and The Faint, as well as
Fink and Taylor's other band,
Now it's Overhead.

Of the decision to release a record on
Saddle Creek, Taylor said," Wejust met the
people and became good friends with
them. They wanted to put out our next
record, but we wanted to put the next full
length out on Warm. So we made a com
promise and said we'd put out an EP on
Saddle Creek. Everyone was really sup
portive. That's the advantage of being on
an indie label — not being sued."
The band's new full-length, "Burn and
Shiver" will be released on Warm in April.
Taylor promises similar songwriting with
more structure than the EP, which, like
their debut album, is comprised of very
simple, stripped-down guitar parts accom

panying their gorgeous voices. Azure Ray's
music is defined by Fink and Taylor's har
monies.
Before the show, I met some people who
had seen Azure Ray play the previous night
in Sacramento. They were so impressed
they drove down to San Francisco the next
day to catch a second dose. I definitely was
moved when I discovered the band at this
festival a year ago and counted down the
days to see them again. Maybe we won't be
seeing Azure Ray open for say, No Doubt,
in the near future (The Faint is currently on
tour supporting No Doubt — a surprising
and controversial move). Still, they are de
veloping into a force to be reckoned with.


Dude, I am so depressed.

festival a year ago and counted down the
days to see them again. Maybe we won't be
seeing Azure Ray open for say, No Doubt,
in the near future (The Faint is currently on
tour supporting No Doubt — a surprising
and controversial move). Still, they are de
veloping into a force to be reckoned with.


Dude, I am so depressed.
You have to be pretty damn good to si
lence a whole audience at a large festival as
a relatively unknown acoustic act.
Last Saturday at Cafe du Nord, Maria
Taylor and Orenda Fink along with new
keyboardist Jackie Lyons captivated the
crowd with their breathtaking melodies.
Singers / guitarists / songwriters Taylor and
Fink sat side by side, guitar necks pointed in
opposite directions. The sold-out crowd,
comprised largely of concert-goers who had
a general week-long festival pass, appropri
ately sat cross-legged on the floor as the girls
launched into their half-hour-long set.
An Azure Ray concert is like no other be
cause the ballads are so slow and moving.
You see the group live to listen closely and
not simply to have an evening out. You
move at its pace for awhile, wondering why
Fink's face is always almost completely ob
scured by her hair as she quietly picks away
at her guitar, or why Taylor sports a pensive
melancholy, wishing you could have what
they have.
I'd have to say that Azure Ray is one of
the most under-appreciated bands 1 have
ever come across. An electronic (keyboards,
not guitars)-acoustic band that hails from
Athens, C ia., its members display a talent for
music you don't normally see these days.
Each of them is proficient in several instru
ments, and boy do they ever use them. Last
year at Noise Pop, they opened for Bright
Eyes and Mark Eitzel. They're touring
members of Bright Eyes, one of their many
musical projects. Fink even played trumpet
in one of the rounds of musical chairs of
each song, after playing bass, keyboards and
guitar.
Founding members Fink and Taylor met

in high school and have played in various
bands since then. As they were first starting
out in Birmingham, Ala., their talent was rec
ognized by current Elektra artists Remy Zero.
"Back then, in the Remy Zero days, what
we did was really bad!" Fink said laughing
ly. "But they for some reason encouraged
us. They set us up with our first practice
space and recording our first songs."
Since then, they have played in an up
beat rock band Little Red Rocket until about
a year and a half ago, when they formed
Azure Ray. They decided to go fora softer
and sadder approach because it reflected
where they were at the time.
"We went through some things that

bununed us out, and we started
writing some of these songs that
were different," explained Fink.
"We wrote these other cathartic
songs which we kept to our
selves for awhile, but then we
decided to play an acoustic show
and played a song, and then
Brian from [the record label]
Warm offered to make a record
of them. We just kept writing
along that style and realized it's
the direction we needed to go
in."
Athens-based Warm Elec
tronic: put out their self-titled
debut album last year. Their
most recent release, a six-song
EP entitled "November" which
came out (ironically) in January
2002, was released on Saddle
Creek, however. Saddle Creek's
claims to fame include Bright
Eyes and The Faint, as well as
Fink and Taylor's other band,
Now it's Overhead.

Of the decision to release a record on
Saddle Creek, Taylor said," Wejust met the
people and became good friends with
them. They wanted to put out our next
record, but we wanted to put the next full
length out on Warm. So we made a com
promise and said we'd put out an EP on
Saddle Creek. Everyone was really sup
portive. That's the advantage of being on
an indie label — not being sued."
The band's new full-length, "Burn and
Shiver" will be released on Warm in April.
Taylor promises similar songwriting with
more structure than the EP, which, like
their debut album, is comprised of very
simple, stripped-down guitar parts accom

panying their gorgeous voices. Azure Ray's
music is defined by Fink and Taylor's har
monies.
Before the show, I met some people who
had seen Azure Ray play the previous night
in Sacramento. They were so impressed
they drove down to San Francisco the next
day to catch a second dose. I definitely was
moved when I discovered the band at this
festival a year ago and counted down the
days to see them again. Maybe we won't be
seeing Azure Ray open for say, No Doubt,
in the near future (The Faint is currently on
tour supporting No Doubt — a surprising
and controversial move). Still, they are de
veloping into a force to be reckoned with.
