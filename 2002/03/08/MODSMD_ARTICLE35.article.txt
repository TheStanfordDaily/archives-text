# 'Exile' an undisputable classic
## 
### BENJAMIN L. FRIEDLAND 
From Keith Richards' opening riff in the bare-bones
"Rocks Off' to Mick Jagger's wail at the end of the gut
wrenching "Soul Survivor," "Exile on Main Street" is ar
guably the greatest record of all time.
This 1972 masterpiece captures the British band at
both the height of their creativity — and their drug use.
The songs combine the Stones' trademark blues rock
with Otis Redding-like horn arrangements, and Jagger

has said that he and
Richards were hit for
hit of heroin during
these sessions.
To Rolling Stones
novices, "Exile on
Main Street" may seem
like an unlikely choice.
"Gimme Shelter" and

"You Can't Always Get What You Want" are the book
ends around 1970's "Let it Bleed" while "Brown Sugar,"
"Wild Horses" and "Dead Flowers" all appear on '71's
"Sticky Fingers." Listeners shouldn't expect "Satisfac
tion," "Ruby Tuesday" or "Jumpin' Jack Flash," nor
should they hope for "Honky Tonk Woman," "Beast of
Burden" or "Let's Spend the Night Together."
Nonetheless, "Exile" remains the group's finest
achievement; what it sacrifices in hits, it more than com
pensates for in consistency, craft and cool.

The first four songs set the
tone for the rest of the album,
showcasing the band's
stripped-down rock, a well
used muddy saxophone (at
tention Boss) and jagger's at
times-unintelligible but al
ways inspired vocals.
It's tracks five through
seven, however — often re-

ferred to as murderer's
row — that solidify this
album's place in rock his
tory. They are the prod
uct of the sloppiest bar
band ever transformed
into disciplined and sea-

soned studio veterans. "Tumbling Dice," for exam
ple, features an irresistible guitar, a catchy melody

and the chorus of back-up singers and harmonies pre
sent throughout the rest of the album. The band released
this song as the album's first single, and it has remained
on classic rock radio A-lists ever since then.
As if exhaling, the band relaxes into "Sweet Virginia,"
an equally dynamic song. Inspired by his love for dis
tilled grape juice, Jagger sings, "Thank you for your
wine, California / Thank you for your sweet and bitter
fruit." An acoustic ballad, the song showcases Jagger's
soothing harmonica (attention Bob) while retaining the

band's Jack Daniels-infused
harmonies. In both its beauty
and alcoholism, "Sweet Vir
ginia" exemplifies everything
special about "Exile on Main
Street," just like the picture of
Jagger and Richards singing
with a bottle of whiskey in hand
on the liner notes.
A friend once described listen
ing to "Ventilator Blues," track
12, as "a sharp punch to the
chest." Although that thought
might be just marginally ap
pealing, he meant it in the best
way. A raw blues rock song,

"Ventilator Blues" typifies why
the Stones have come to define rock and roll, [agger's
screaming, the band's bottom heavy rhythm section and
the pounding piano get right in your face and ask, "What
are you gonna do about it?"
By the time Jagger sings, "Well, the barrooms and
smelly Bordellos," in "Torn and Frayed," listeners
should have already fallen in love with the album's pro
duction. While Beatles faithful rank this as their chief
complaint, these heroin-inspired arrangements tweak
the vocals to sound like just another instrument resulting
in an overpowering irreverence — the album's most dis
tinct quality and the Stones' legacy to rock 'n' roll music.
