# Adult. steals show at Noise Pop
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
The 10th annual
Noise Pop festival
blasted through its sec
ond evening with a
monstrous wave of syn
thesizers and vocoders.
Hosted at the hip and

plush Bimbo's 365 Club (did someone say
"Bathroom attendant?"), this sold-out show
boasted an amazingly solid line-up of the
best synth bands in America, including 1 Am
Spoonbender, Adult, and The Faint. The
crowd at the show was a fine mix of expen
sive shoes, cool hair-dos and skinny ties, and
most everyone found an occasion to dance as
the beat-heavy keyboard sounds swept Mod
and Goth alike away in reverie. In the end,
everyone in attendance found themselves
tinny-eared, exhausted and sweaty, laugh
ing with delight at one of the best concerts of
the past year.
The concert was a showcase in the best
sense of the word, with the finest of electro,
experimental noise, dance music, '80s pop,
and rock and roll led to the eager (and un
naturally fashionable) crowd.
Neo-new wave rock outfit The Faint is
soon to embark on a nationwide tour as the
opening act for No Doubt, and word on
the street is that all the major labels are in a
bidding war over the band's follow up to
last year's "I)ause Macabre," a dark, sexy
pop adventure with "D-A-N-C-E" written
all over it.
That said, it was thrilling to see the group
perform in a small club setting to a crowd of
its most heartfelt fans. 1 must admit that I
that fear playing to No Doubt fans every
night for months on end will have a corrupt
ing effect on the band. 1 mean, conceivably,
The Faint might actually be in the same
room as that Gavin guy from that painfully

bad band Bush, assuming
that Gwen Stefani is still
dragging his ass around. I
shudder at the thought.
Regardless, The
Faint was totally com
pelling live and had every
kid in the club writhing
and shaking to the beats.

As a result of the high levels of "rocking"
going on, a glass bottle was smashed onstage,

my friend Michael's shirt was torn
asunder and one poor girl in the
audience received a mic stand to
the face as The Faint's lead singer
kicked and swaggered. Despite the
losses, it was surely a small price for
such a fantastic set.
1 An Spoonbender entranced
the audience with a mostly instru
mental, completely choreo
graphed performance, including
matching red and black uniforms
for the band and a synchronized
video show projected onto the
stage. Debuting new material from
its upcoming album "Hidden Per
suaders," I Am Spoonbender's set
was powered by droning bass and
lilting vocals. Each member used a
modified rotary telephone as a mi
crophone, and the band's no-gui
tar sound was powerful and sober,

keeping the attention of everyone in the
club. Giving the crowd a taste of the best of
noise-meets-art pop, the experience of see
ing Spoonbender perform live left the
crowd's ears ringing and eyes blinded.
As the opening band for two amazing
bands such as The Faint and Spoonbender,
Detroit duo Adult, surely had its hands full.
Already madly famous in Detroit, Germany
and England, Adult, remained mostly un
known in San Francisco; that is, until last

Wednesday night.
Adult, is comprised of members Nicola
Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller, who graced
the stage at Bimbo's wearing matching black
security uniforms with their band's logo
stitched on the sleeves.
Plainly stilted, Adult.'s debut album "Re
suscitation" was the best tiling to come out in
2001. In a year when indie rock went to hell
in a handbasket, and fourth-wave alterna
tive (the crap diat's worse than Creed) made

its move on MTV and modern rock sta
tions, Adult, breathed a lovely, synthetic
breath of fresh air into the music scene.
The duo's monotone vocals revolve
around themes of technology, isolation,
consumption and the artificiality of contact
with others, while their incredibly intricate
beats and pulses are alive enough to fill any
car, door room or concert venue with elec
tricity. Self-released on their own Ersatz
Audio record label, Adult.'s albums are hard

to find in most record shops around the Bay
area, but are well worth the search. Contin
uing to produce new music all the time, the
group is sure to keep gaining notoriety in
both electronic and indie music circles.
That said, Adult, stole the show during
its Noise Pop debut with relentless
Kraftwerk-beats and haunting vocoded
computer vocals. Playing all its best songs
from "Resuscitation" plus a few new tracks
from an upcoming 7 inch, Adult, converted

the audience of mostly Faint fans
to its camp. The band even took
a few moments between songs to
throw free copies of their records
into the audience.
To paraphrase: Adult,
rocked hard Wednesday night. I
mean, really hard. So hard that
people in the crowd forgot their
own birthdays. So hard that the
family members of those in at
tendance perished. So hard that
at least two of the guys in The
Faint went through puberty
again. Adult, rocked so hard
that satellites fell to earth and
the governments of small East
ern European countries fell. So
hard that a solar flare erupted
from the sun and one-third of
the squirrel population at Stan
ford fell over dead.

1 think you get the picture.
While all three of the bands that per
formed that night are surely destined for
greatness, it was a stroke of divine luck to be
able to witness each at their best, in good
company, on stage in a great city like San
Francisco. Surely such a perfect and awe
some line-up only comes once in years. Do
your dancing shoes a favor and check out
one of these bands in the future. Both I and
Michael's destroyed shirt will thank you.

bad band Bush, assuming
that Gwen Stefani is still
dragging his ass around. I
shudder at the thought.
Regardless, The
Faint was totally com
pelling live and had every
kid in the club writhing
and shaking to the beats.

As a result of the high levels of "rocking"
going on, a glass bottle was smashed onstage,

my friend Michael's shirt was torn
asunder and one poor girl in the
audience received a mic stand to
the face as The Faint's lead singer
kicked and swaggered. Despite the
losses, it was surely a small price for
such a fantastic set.
1 An Spoonbender entranced
the audience with a mostly instru
mental, completely choreo
graphed performance, including
matching red and black uniforms
for the band and a synchronized
video show projected onto the
stage. Debuting new material from
its upcoming album "Hidden Per
suaders," I Am Spoonbender's set
was powered by droning bass and
lilting vocals. Each member used a
modified rotary telephone as a mi
crophone, and the band's no-gui
tar sound was powerful and sober,

keeping the attention of everyone in the
club. Giving the crowd a taste of the best of
noise-meets-art pop, the experience of see
ing Spoonbender perform live left the
crowd's ears ringing and eyes blinded.
As the opening band for two amazing
bands such as The Faint and Spoonbender,
Detroit duo Adult, surely had its hands full.
Already madly famous in Detroit, Germany
and England, Adult, remained mostly un
known in San Francisco; that is, until last

Wednesday night.
Adult, is comprised of members Nicola
Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller, who graced
the stage at Bimbo's wearing matching black
security uniforms with their band's logo
stitched on the sleeves.
Plainly stilted, Adult.'s debut album "Re
suscitation" was the best tiling to come out in
2001. In a year when indie rock went to hell
in a handbasket, and fourth-wave alterna
tive (the crap diat's worse than Creed) made

its move on MTV and modern rock sta
tions, Adult, breathed a lovely, synthetic
breath of fresh air into the music scene.
The duo's monotone vocals revolve
around themes of technology, isolation,
consumption and the artificiality of contact
with others, while their incredibly intricate
beats and pulses are alive enough to fill any
car, door room or concert venue with elec
tricity. Self-released on their own Ersatz
Audio record label, Adult.'s albums are hard

to find in most record shops around the Bay
area, but are well worth the search. Contin
uing to produce new music all the time, the
group is sure to keep gaining notoriety in
both electronic and indie music circles.
That said, Adult, stole the show during
its Noise Pop debut with relentless
Kraftwerk-beats and haunting vocoded
computer vocals. Playing all its best songs
from "Resuscitation" plus a few new tracks
from an upcoming 7 inch, Adult, converted

the audience of mostly Faint fans
to its camp. The band even took
a few moments between songs to
throw free copies of their records
into the audience.
To paraphrase: Adult,
rocked hard Wednesday night. I
mean, really hard. So hard that
people in the crowd forgot their
own birthdays. So hard that the
family members of those in at
tendance perished. So hard that
at least two of the guys in The
Faint went through puberty
again. Adult, rocked so hard
that satellites fell to earth and
the governments of small East
ern European countries fell. So
hard that a solar flare erupted
from the sun and one-third of
the squirrel population at Stan
ford fell over dead.

1 think you get the picture.
While all three of the bands that per
formed that night are surely destined for
greatness, it was a stroke of divine luck to be
able to witness each at their best, in good
company, on stage in a great city like San
Francisco. Surely such a perfect and awe
some line-up only comes once in years. Do
your dancing shoes a favor and check out
one of these bands in the future. Both I and
Michael's destroyed shirt will thank you.

plush Bimbo's 365 Club (did someone say

Spoonbender, Adult, and The Faint. The
