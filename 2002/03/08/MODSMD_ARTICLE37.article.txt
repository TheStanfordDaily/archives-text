# Local H busy taming the serpent

Scott Lucas is amazingly clear
headed in his thoughts after losing
both his drummer and his record
contract. That doesn't necessarily
keep him from sounding pissed as
hell as he shreds honest rock and
slow-grind metal on Local H's

fourth release, "Here Comes the Zoo."
Local H, a two-man baud Lucas started in 1987 with
a high-school buddy, broke out in a run in 1996 when
MTV sniffed out H's single "Bound to the Floor" off
its second album, "As Good As Dead." H faded out of
the scene as sell-out bands like Sugar Ray took over
mainstream, trading in its angst-filled guitars for
processed pop.
Following 1999's heavily lauded album "Pack Up
the Cats," which was orchestrated by Queen / Cars
producer Roy Thomas Baker, Zoo returns the same
remnants of an era once one with garage grunge and
metal / punk.
Their latest album, carved together by former
Cheap Trick producer Jack Douglas, bites fast and
hard with meditations on religion ("Hands on the
Bible"), the music industry ("Rock & Roll Profession
als") and 9 minutes of sort-of lave ("Baby Wants to

LocalH
"Here Comes the
Palm Records

Tame Me"), among other hot topics.
Douglas, who also worked with Aero-

smith, brings an all-star team of support for
the album with guest appearances by-Simi's
Simantha Sernaker, Queens of the Stone
Age's Josh Homme, and Sullen's Shanna
Kiel on perhaps the catchiest track, "sth
Ave. Crazy."
Brian St. Clair replaces fomer H drum-

mer Joe Daniels, with whom Lucas started the band. St.
Clair, once a member of TripleFastAction, adds drum
tracks that establish H's sound slightly away from the
Stone Temple Pilots wannabes they might've been con
sidered a few years ago. They bring the sound closer to
the Local M that Lucas envisioned during the band's
early years.
"I've really been digging back into what made me
like rock in the first place," Lucas said in an Indie
Press Online interview in 1996. "I just don't want to
make Hootie and the Blowfish records. You know, a
lot of the bands ... [selling] records ... suck, like Hootie
and the Blowfish do. And, I mean, they're not even
sounding like Pearl Jam anymore, which used to
annoy the hell out of me. Now they just sound like car
bon copies of those bands. I don't want to do that."
Lucas' vision is shown cleaner than ever in Zoo, and one
might go so far as to think that if Nirvana were around

today, it might just sound like this record. While "Zoo"
might take a second or even third listening-through he
fore it gets slightly comfortable to rock to, in the midst of
the hundreds of Sugar Ray-like bands' disposable radio
pop, that's understandable.
Local II hits the City on March 19 when it plays at
the SF Pound.


I want some, too.
