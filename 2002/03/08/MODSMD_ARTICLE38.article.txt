# You can't pull the plug on Ozomatli

"We're not dogmatic
tats," he explained. "We're
not going to demand that
you change your views or act
in a certain way. What we
feel honest about is some
very basic things, that people
deserve to be housed and
have food. And there are
plenty of resources to go
around for that. The way a
lot of governments and busi
nesses are set up, that's not a
possibility and we think
that's wrong."
He went on to criticize
the Bush administration's
fixation on war and disre
gard for domestic issues. "So
it's like, we're spending so
much money right now on
this war, for instance, that to
me is a front fora lot of dif
ferent things. And there's
money to be made in that.
But it's not going to be

are the freewheeling madcap transitions, but the en
ergy is still there. As if reflecting the new cohesiveness
within the songs, "Pa Lante," Pancheco's favorite
track, opens the album with a bright, infectious cam
paign for solidarity.
"[Pa Lante] means 'all together, we can .go forward
together,'" he said. "It talks-about the universal love
between humans, remembering people around you
can help you, trusting each other to move forward."
My favorite track is the catchy, swinging "1234,"
which features some guest rapping from l)e La Soul.
Play this track at a party, and I guarantee that every
one in the house will be yelling "1-2-3-4" by the end
of the song.
Ozomatli is definitely an L.A. band, full of multi
cultural life and energy. Their music could play on
every radio station in Los Angeles. Maybe that's what
it is: the amalgam of music you'd get if you spun the
dial on your radio as you drove across Orange Coun
ty. Or maybe it's what you'd gel if you just rolled
down your windows and listened to the music coming
from the streets.
"Being from different communities, it was cool that
we were able to get together," Pancheco said. "It be
came a metaphor for something bigger, which was,
'You can all be different, you can hold onto your val
ues, your cultural values and still find the connection
and make something beautiful.'"
And indeed, the music is beautiful and fun. But
sometimes, when Ozomatli say they're an L.A. band,

money that goes to schools."
In the second page of images from the CD, each of
the seven band members is caught on a closed circuit

The folks at Tower Records are going to hate "Em
brace the Chaos," the new CD from Ozomatli. Not be
cause the CD is bad. Hell no, this CD rocks. And*sal
sas. And funks. And it will sell like pancakes. No, the
Tower Records employees are going to hate it because
it will be impossible to categorize and they won't know
where to find it when customers ask for it. Rock /
Pop? Jazz? Latin? Reggae? Hip-hop? Who knows, and
who cares? It's all there, and it's all good.
Last week, before a show at San Francisco's
Warfield Theater, I spoke with Raul Pancheco, lead
guitarist and vocalist for the band. If Ozomatli ever
had a frontman, and it won't because it is far too hum
ble a band for that, Pancheco might be the best candi
date. Pancheco was busy explaining a triptych of im
ages from the CD liner notes.
"Here, we're running away from the police," he said,
referring to pictures of the band members, instru
ments in hand, leaping fences and hiding behind cars.
Judging from the way he looks on the CD, if I were
the police, I'd be running away from Pancheco. With
a bald, shiny head (except fora tiny mohawk), he
looks like he could give Jesse "The Body" Ventura a
decent match.
But in person, Pancheco was small, polite and mel
low. Though the band prides itself on its ability to be
chill and laid-back, its members nonetheless have
seen their fair share of the police.
"We have been to a lot of protests," he said. "We've
put ourselves into physical danger at times."
Ozomatli has a reputation for being a political
band. Eat your heart out, U2, but these guys met at
protests and lived in a downtown Los Angeles com
mune, the Peace and Justice Centre. The title track of
the new album details the difficulty the band had in
playing at the protests at the 2000 Democratic Na
tional Convention. Police eventually broke up these
protests, forced the band to stop playing and fired
rubber bullets into the crowd. Ozomatli kept playing
on the streets. A voiceover on the track says,"The
message that we were sending to the police, to the De
mocrats, to the corporate backers, is that you can't
pull the plug on democracy."
I asked Pancheco how they could reconcile this
earnest political message with the tongue-in-cheek
pictures in the liner notes.

ment which is ostensibly the rea
son for the police pursuit in the
first set of pictures.
Originally, the band had 15
members or so, though it was
impossible to define exactly who
was in the band and who was just
hanging out. Anyone with a set
of bongos could show up at the
Peace and Justice Centre and
play along.
Musicians from other parts of
the L.A. music scene have also
dropped in from time to time.
Cut Chemist preceded I) J Spino
bi as the resident turntablist.
And Chali 2Na, also of Jurassic
5, has helped with the MC-ing.
Hut as the band began to tour
and become more serious, its
members had to winnow it down
for practical purposes. Now it
has seven credited band mem
bers on the album 10 that it
tours with. But divisiveness
over the usual issues — money,
spotlight, credit — isn't a prob
lem with Ozomatli.

people get the wrong impression.
"We're very proud of being from LA," he ex
plained. "But I remember we were in Belgium play
ing a festival and they introduced us and they were
like, 'From the land of violence, Los Angeles!"'
"There's this whole image of L.A. that's either like
this kooky glamour or toughness on the streets and
there's definitely that, but it's also a very' Hollywood
image of what happens there. Like any other place,
there's millions of people trying to struggle every day
to survive, to make the best that they can of their lives,
to make a good life for their families."
After stealing instruments and evading the police,
Pancheco explained what Ozomatli was doing in the
last set of pictures from the liner notes.
"Where do we end up?" he asked. "On the street
corner, playing music. For the people."

"We do a lot of things in this band that are rare. We
share everything," Pancheco said.
The album also shares many distinctive musical
styles. On its first self-titled album, the different musi
cal styles were crammed into each song like sardines.
With names like "Cut Chemist Suite" and "Super Bowl
Sundae," each song promised a delectable melange.
But while the shifts in style — say from a samba to a
reggae — were interesting, they often seemed more
forced than spontaneous, as if the band was showing
off its fluency in just about every musical genre.
"We liked those [transitions], but you can't force
it," Pancheco admitted. "It has to seem natural. Over
all, 1 think the [new] record sounds better, and the
songs are better."
The new album has consistency and drive. Gone

Do these look like a bunch of dogmatic cats to you?
