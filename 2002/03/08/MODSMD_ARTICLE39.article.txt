# Kylie Minogue is porn-tastic!
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
So we might as well
get this out of the way
right now — Kylie
Minogue is super-hot.
She totally sizzles —
hell, she scorches. And
it's not just the fact that
she's jaw-droppingly
gorgeous and has a
great bod. More impor-

tant is the knowing, candid way she em
braces her sex-kitten persona, from the

Kylie Minogue
Capitol Records (W
irirCrCrC? —

come-hither expression she bears in all
her photos to the kinky poses she strikes

with her micro
phone in the liner
notes of "Fever,"
her latest album.
Kylie doesn't
waste any time with
Britney's virgin
whore coyness. One
friend paging
through her pictori-

al in"The Face" wondered, "My God,
doesn't she ever wear any pants?" Judg
ing from the photos I've seen, I'd have to
answer no. And I for one am glad.
Now that she's established herself as
a goddess in Europe and her native Aus
tralia, "Fever" is Kylie's attempt to con
quer the States. Not surprisingly, the
actual music feels relatively unimpor
tant, a footnote to Kylie and her hot
ness, but "Fever" isn't half-bad. If that
feels like damning with faint praise, well
hell, 1 doubt anyone was expecting
"Blonde on Blonde."
The album's 12 tracks all pidse with
electronic beats that bridge the gap be
tween disco and techno, while Kylie
sings in the usual vague homilies about
love and lust. The music is last and defi
nitely catchy, especially on the
Kraftwerk-esque single "Can't Get You
Out Of My Head," even if I end up wish
ing that it wasn't so subservient to the
unchanging beat.
Kylie's voice doesn't have a lot of

range, but it's pleasant
enough, and along with the
breeziness of the tunes, the
playfulness in her tone
makes the banal lyrics go
down much more easily.
"And everything went from
wrong to right / And the
stars came up and filled the
sky / the music you were
playing really blew my
mind / It was love at first
sight," a melodramatic
verse from "Love at First
Sight," is made at least bear
able by Kylie's singing.
The real shame of the
album is that most of the
lyrics lack share the sense of
playful joy found in Kylie's
delivery, and instead have
her earnestly proclaiming
her love and desire for the
listener in track after track.
The words' vacuous

anonymity started to get to
me after a while, especially since they
generally never utilize Kylie's sexiness.
If none of the songwriters had anything
original to say, they should have includ
ed more songs that smolder like the title
track, in which Kylie declares, "There
ain't a surgeon like you any place in all
the world / So now shall 1 remove my
clothes?" (Yes, please).
As catchy as the CD is, one gets that
feeling that it could have been a lot more

fun if the songwriters (a group that in
cludes Kylie herself) had really taken ad
vantage of Kylie's talents. If she's got a
sex-goddess image, an image cheerfully
exploited in the album's photos, why not
incorporate that image and play with it
in the songs themselves?
But hey, it isn't as mind-numbing as a
Britney or Celine Dione ballad, and you
can definitely dance to it.
By the way, did I mention that Kylie's
really hot?


Aren't my legs pretty?


I know, I'm gorgeous.
