Traditional University hierar
chies will be reversed Monday
night, with professors, staff and
administrators slaving over hot
serving pans to satiate the ap
petites of thousands of Stanford
students, in the fourth annual in
carnation of the Stanford tradition
known as Midnight Breakfast.
The breakfast will take place Mon
day night from 1 1:3() p.m. to 1:()()
a.m. at Wilbur Dining, Lakeside
Dining and Tresidder's Bon Ap
petit Dining. The event is free and

open to all undergraduate and
graduate students.
According to Asst. Director of
Student Activities and event orga
nizer Judith Biller, the breakfast
was conceived as a way for students
and faculty to interact in a less for

"The event's inception was to
create a goodwill gesture on the
part of Stanford to show how
much we value the students, and
[to show] that the faculty and
staff are doing everything possi

Biller said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais

echoed Billet 's sentiments.
"The fact that the president,
provost and others return to cam
pus at the midnight hour to serve
students a free hot breakfast
speaks volumes about their pas

Over 40 faculty members and
administrators are expected to
show off their culinary talents, in
cluding many of the University's
most senior members. University
President John Hennessy,
Provost John Etchemendy and
Wais will all be present.
Additional servers are sched

dergraduate Education John
Bravman, Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Robin Mamlet, Dean
of Religious Life Scotty McLennan
and Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni.
"It's a fun opportunity to turn
the tables' fora brief time and have
students order faculty and admin
istrators around," McLennan, who
will be participating in his first
breakfast, said. "If that's at least
part of the impetus here, doing it
