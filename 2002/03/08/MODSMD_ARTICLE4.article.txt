# Breakfast to feature University leaders
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Traditional University hierar
chies will be reversed Monday
night, with professors, staff and
administrators slaving over hot
serving pans to satiate the ap
petites of thousands of Stanford
students, in the fourth annual in
carnation of the Stanford tradition
known as Midnight Breakfast.
The breakfast will take place Mon
day night from 1 1:3() p.m. to 1:()()
a.m. at Wilbur Dining, Lakeside
Dining and Tresidder's Bon Ap
petit Dining. The event is free and

open to all undergraduate and
graduate students.
According to Asst. Director of
Student Activities and event orga
nizer Judith Biller, the breakfast
was conceived as a way for students
and faculty to interact in a less for
mal setting than the classroom.
"The event's inception was to
create a goodwill gesture on the
part of Stanford to show how
much we value the students, and
[to show] that the faculty and
staff are doing everything possi
ble to get to know the students,"
Biller said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais

echoed Billet 's sentiments.
"The fact that the president,
provost and others return to cam
pus at the midnight hour to serve
students a free hot breakfast
speaks volumes about their pas
sion for and commitment to stu
dents," Wais said.
Over 40 faculty members and
administrators are expected to
show off their culinary talents, in
cluding many of the University's
most senior members. University
President John Hennessy,
Provost John Etchemendy and
Wais will all be present.
Additional servers are sched

uled to include Vice Provost of Un
dergraduate Education John
Bravman, Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Robin Mamlet, Dean
of Religious Life Scotty McLennan
and Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni.
"It's a fun opportunity to turn
the tables' fora brief time and have
students order faculty and admin
istrators around," McLennan, who
will be participating in his first
breakfast, said. "If that's at least
part of the impetus here, doing it
during Dead Week at Stanford
seems appropriate, as [it is] a time
[during which] students may feel
most put upon by faculty."
Between 2,500 and 2,700 stu
dents have traditionally attended
the breakfast, and Biller hopes at
tendance will reach 2,800 this
year.
"The Midnight Breakfast is a fa
vorite among University adminis
trators and students on this cam
pus," Biller said. "The administra
tors love having the time with stu
dents in this more informal set
ting. This year we have changed
some things and included more
raffle prizes and free giveaways in
hopes to even get more under
graduates and graduate students
to attend."
Students planning on attend
ing the event for the first time
seem happy with the opportunity
to order their professors around.
"This event has multiple bene
fits as far as I am concerned," said
freshman Frank Sotelo. "It not
only allows me to eat breakfast
without having to wake up for it,
but it's also free.
" But most importantly, it will be
fun to interact with faculty and
staff in a light-hearted and non
academic setting."
Freshman Brian Chan is also
enthusiastic about the event.

"I like faculty," Chan said. "I
like food. Faculty and food must be
really good."
Some worry, however, that the
event cannot possibly allow for sig
nificant interaction between stu
dents and staff.
I he Midnight Breakfast
sounds like a good idea," fresh
man Elizabeth Ayala said. "But I
question how much faculty [and]
student interaction can take
place when Hennessy, professors
[and others] are just serving us
food."
Freshman Chris Herrera said
he also has his doubts.
"Maybe they should dish out
some A's and B's along with those
yummy, yummy pancakes," Her
rera said.
Overall, student response in
the past has been very positive, as
indicated by the consistently
high turnouts.
"1 had a great time at Midnight
Breakfast last year, interacting
with faculty, eating good food and
winning prizes from the raffle con
test," said Shiao Chien, one of this
year's senior class presidents.
This year's event will include
a broader collection of raffle and
door prizes, including MP3
players and gift certificates to
stores.
Tickets are required and can
be picked up today and Monday
in White Plaza and Escondido
Village between 11:00 a.m. and
1:00 p.m.
