# 'One Dead Body' filled with life

makers shot a scene of 2001 graduate Zack Kinney lying
dead in the Toyon courtyard gripping a coffee canister,
and each subsequently wrote, directed, and edited a film
providing an explanation of how the death transpired.
The film, entitled "One Dead Body," was an enter
taining array of shorts that were highly impressive in
both originality of plot as well as visual technique. Rather

"Two" was a montage of scenes of rough sex in alleyways
— the plot was unclear, but what made it interesting and
funny was its exaggerated sexuality and its hokey, black
and-white reminiscence of an early-'9os Ace of Base
video, complete with generic techno music. Stephanie
Gerson's "metronome 9" was a smoldering, dark tale of

The screening debut last Friday of the Pumpkin Pie
Project, an inventive and unprecedented collaboration
of the cinematic visions of 10 student filmmakers, re
vealed one of campus's best-kept secrets: the arts at Stan
ford are alive and well.
Despite the fact that the opportunity for students to
study film at Stanford has historically been somewhat
limited — there is no official undergraduate film studies
program offered — the Stanford Film Society provides a
venue through which aspiring filmmakers can craft their
narrative and artistic bravado into a reality. Film at Stan
ford has been particularly nourishing in the past few
years, as marked by the popularity of and increased par
ticipation in the annual Stanford Student Film Festival,
presented by SFS.
In the same vein, the SFS-sponsored Pumpkin Pie
Project characterizes an unparalleled surge in campus
wide interest in the art of film, as was evident by the scads
of viewers crowded into Annenberg Auditorium offering
rowdy support at the screening, as well as the incredible
creativity and diversity of perspectives utilized by the
participating filmmakers.
The basic concept of the project, conceived and or
chestrated last October by Matt Brutocao, was to draw
from the imagination of several SFS filmmakers. Each one
created a short film interpreting the narrative origin of a
single shot agreed upon by all participants. In a sort of a
retrograde "Run, Lola, Run"-esque scenario, the 10 film-

than choosing the most obvious scenario
of Kinney being poisoned to death, the
films tapped into some unconventional
explanations for the death that included
animation, a modern-day take on
Shakespeare, parody of trashy infomer
cials and kinky sex. The audience was
taken on an unexpectedly thrilling ride
that, while in some circumstances lacked
sensical plot, compensated with oddity
and humor.

continuity, but, then again, featured
the use of body paint.
Despite the occasional nonsensi

most notably that of star Zack Kin

roles, such as that of the meek, stressed-out employee
and the bitter, philosophizing man making his own sui
cide video. Valerie Sinckler, also a 2001 graduate, shone
in multiple shorts, notably .is the deadpan Death in Bru
tucao's film and a lively chorus member in Hanson's.
The Pumpkin Pie Project can be deemed as successful
not only because of the tremendous imagination of all its
collaborators, but because of what it represents: bur
geoning talent and the growing film culture at Stanford.
If you missed it, there will be another screening Thurs
day, March 14 at 8 pm in Building 200, room 2. To learn

The works of some directors stood out as particularly
inventive and well-done; Brooke Hanson's "Antigone: A
Musical Revival" featured a hilarious toga-clad chorus of
women unabashedly singing and dancing in an attempt to
revive the dead body of C.reon (Kinney). Ryan Lohbauer
played on the cheesiness of cartoon characters with his
animated feature, "Baby Soft," of a boy who wants to be
"real" and trips out on his journey to get there. Matt Bru
tucao's "The Remarkable Life of Jonathan Savant" told
the story of a self-important man who is unknowingly
tracked by the human persona of Death.

The screening debut last Friday of the Pumpkin Pie
Project, an inventive and unprecedented collaboration
of the cinematic visions of 10 student filmmakers, re
vealed one of campus's best-kept secrets: the arts at Stan
ford are alive and well.
Despite the fact that the opportunity for students to
study film at Stanford has historically been somewhat
limited — there is no official undergraduate film studies
program offered — the Stanford Film Society provides a
venue through which aspiring filmmakers can craft their
narrative and artistic bravado into a reality. Film at Stan
ford has been particularly nourishing in the past few
years, as marked by the popularity of and increased par
ticipation in the annual Stanford Student Film Festival,
presented by SFS.
In the same vein, the SFS-sponsored Pumpkin Pie
Project characterizes an unparalleled surge in campus
wide interest in the art of film, as was evident by the scads
of viewers crowded into Annenberg Auditorium offering
rowdy support at the screening, as well as the incredible
creativity and diversity of perspectives utilized by the
participating filmmakers.
The basic concept of the project, conceived and or
chestrated last October by Matt Brutocao, was to draw
from the imagination of several SFS filmmakers. Each one
created a short film interpreting the narrative origin of a
single shot agreed upon by all participants. In a sort of a
retrograde "Run, Lola, Run"-esque scenario, the 10 film-

than choosing the most obvious scenario
of Kinney being poisoned to death, the
films tapped into some unconventional
explanations for the death that included
animation, a modern-day take on
Shakespeare, parody of trashy infomer
cials and kinky sex. The audience was
taken on an unexpectedly thrilling ride
that, while in some circumstances lacked
sensical plot, compensated with oddity
and humor.

roles, such as that of the meek, stressed-out employee
and the bitter, philosophizing man making his own sui
cide video. Valerie Sinckler, also a 2001 graduate, shone
in multiple shorts, notably .is the deadpan Death in Bru
tucao's film and a lively chorus member in Hanson's.
The Pumpkin Pie Project can be deemed as successful
not only because of the tremendous imagination of all its
collaborators, but because of what it represents: bur
geoning talent and the growing film culture at Stanford.
If you missed it, there will be another screening Thurs
day, March 14 at 8 pm in Building 200, room 2. To learn

The works of some directors stood out as particularly
inventive and well-done; Brooke Hanson's "Antigone: A
Musical Revival" featured a hilarious toga-clad chorus of
women unabashedly singing and dancing in an attempt to
revive the dead body of C.reon (Kinney). Ryan Lohbauer
played on the cheesiness of cartoon characters with his
animated feature, "Baby Soft," of a boy who wants to be
"real" and trips out on his journey to get there. Matt Bru
tucao's "The Remarkable Life of Jonathan Savant" told
the story of a self-important man who is unknowingly
tracked by the human persona of Death.
