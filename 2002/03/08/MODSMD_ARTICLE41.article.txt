# Shaham rocks with SF Symphony

### EREZ YOELI 
Last Friday, the San Francisco Sympho
ny featured two colossal pieces in one night
and, although the two works appeared on
the same program, they shared little else.

The first, Steven
Mackey's "Pedal
Tones," was a world
premiere written for
pipe organ and an ex
pansive orchestra, com
plete with four percus
sionists, bass clarinets,
trombones and bas
soons and a harp.
The piece was extra-

ordinarily, well, extraordinary. Mackey
makes particularly effective use of contrast
ing elements of the orchestra by using the
percussion section to drive forth the pedal
tones played by the organ and the low brass
and winds. Throughout the first half of the
piece, the first plays a slowly-changing syn-

copated rhythm which eventually morphs
into a funk-like beat straight out of a Dave
Matthews track.
In the meantime, the rest of the percus
sion section bounced between the marim
ba, xylophone, glockenspiel, timpanis, bass

drums, gongs,
cymbals and
(yes) the wine
bottle clustered
in the rear of the
stage, adding
color to the open
harmonies of
fourths and fifths
floating over the
strings and over-

liead in the organ. At one point, the fourth
played the bass drum using three bouncy
balls of the kind children play with, creating
a "Jurassic Park"-like effect that amused the
audience greatly. Despite a lack of tradi
tional melodic and harmonic constructions,
the piece maintained forward momentum

and, thanks to the orchestra's fine attention
to detail, plenty of clarity.
During intermission, the lights dimmed
on the percussion instruments and the or
chestra shrank to its pre-roinantic form in
preparation for Ludwig van Beethoven's
"Violin Concerto in D Major." The
evening's performer, Gil Shaham, walked
modestly onto the stage dressed in a tuxedo
like those worn by other orchestra mem
bers— he would maintain this simplistic at
titude throughout the performance, con
centrating on making great music, and not
on pleasing the crowd.
The piece began with five soft notes in
the timpani, setting the tone and establish
ing thematic material for the entire open
ing movement. Shaham entered a few mo
ments later and was, from that moment on,
the center of the entire audience's atten
tion. His tone and his phrasing were flaw
less; his interaction with the orchestra
seamless. Performers as creative and re
fined are few and I found myself wishing to

share this concert with my great uncle or
my grandfather, both of whom love the vi
olin so much.
Shaham and the orchestra performed
the third movement with exceptional bril
liance. During this movement, the violin is
often carefully shadowed by the orchestra
and these moments were carefully execut
ed, sounding playful and colorful. The
theme, the climaxes and the developmental
sections were all appropriately distin
guished and, most of all, the performers —
Shaham, Tilson Thomas and the rest —
were excited to be there, excited to play to
gether and excited because they knew they
sounded very, very good.
The San Francisco audience, generally
quite generous with its applause, was down
right exuberant upon the piece's closure.
Every last one of us was on our feet and no
one left until it was clear there would, sadly,
be no encores. The symphony had accom
plished its goals that evening. It had left its
listeners yearning for more.
