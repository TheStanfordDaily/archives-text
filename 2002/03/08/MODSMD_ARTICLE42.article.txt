# Wright bends the high notes
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
Every so often, a singer comes along who takes fa
miliar sounds, words and influences, and then prompt
ly molds them into a work completely her own. Enter
Jaguar Wright, the phe-

nomenal newest singer
from the Roots Okay
Player camp. First heard
on the Roots' "Come
Alive," Wright now
brings us her solo debut
"Denials, Delusions and

Jaguar Wright
Denials, Delusions,
and Decisions (W
mca
++++& -

Decisions," an album of extraordinary passion, craft,
and maturity.
Like Jill Scott, but with a little less jazz and a little more
street; like Mary J. Blige, but with a little more energy,
Jaguar Wright sounds both familiar and new. Her vocal
prowess is showcased on "Denials, Delusions and Deci
sions," (she can bend those high notes with the best of the
new crop of Philly soul women) but the album also
sparkles from her passionate songwriting. Wright co-

wrote every song 011 the record, ex
cept fora cover of "Love Need and
Want You," which she delivers
beautifully.
The album starts with a bang,
as Wright struggles with "The
What If s" of a love gone astray on
the first track. Familiar subject?
Yes, but Wright expresses her
thoughts with a depth of perspec
tive and vulnerability that's her
own: "I can't blame it on love,
'cause common sense it plays its
part / can't blame it on you, 'cause
you don't own my heart / can't
blame it on her, she can't be that
smart / messing with you, she
gonna get a broken heart / so what
if what if what if."
Realistic self-assurance seems to
be a common theme on the record.
Even in her most vulnerable songs,
Wright comes off as very self-as
sured in her decision to share her
vulnerabilities with us. She gets
more direct on the subject with
"Self Love," where she preaches
the value of being your own biggest
support, and chastises a friend for
not taking control of her own life.
The guest talent on the album
helps to make it even better â€” The
Roots' Puestlove can be found pro
ducing and drumming on numer
ous tracks. Black Thought guest
raps on two tracks as well, and Bilal
shares an incredibly steamy and
adulturous duet with Wright 011,
"I Can't Wait." But it is Wright's
powerful lyrics and soulful deliv
erv that give the album its core.

The way she fires off the lyrics, "Now I make my music,
got me some new dick and I'm doin' fine /and I'm still
real ghetto bitch and I'll still kick your behind," sung to
an ex-friend on the track "Ain't Nobody Playin'," is
soaked in conviction.
The album does misstep once or twice, falling into

more generic R&B fare on "2 Too Many" and to a less
er degree on "I Don't Know," but it hardly matters.
Overall, "Denials, Delusions and Decisions" shines
with Jaguar Wright's soul and presence. L-et's hope
her presence is with us for much longer than just her
debut album.
