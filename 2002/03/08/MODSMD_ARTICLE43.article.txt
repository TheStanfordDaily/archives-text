# Drag the River for country punk
## 
### SCOTT DORFMAN 
At first glance, it seems like a recipe for
disaster. Put a group of well-established
punk musicians into a studio, turn down
the guitars, and charge them with the task
of creating an album of traditional country
songs. After all, what could sound less ap
pealing than Johnny Rotten covering
Tammy Wynette?
If the first release from the Fort Collins;
Colorado-based group Drag The River is
any indication, then the Sex Pistols might
have done a mighty bitching rendition of
"Stand By Your Man." The group is com
prised of Chad Price, Jon Snodgrass, Paul
Rucker and J.J. Nobody — whose day jobs
consist of playing in the punk bands ALL.,
Armchair Martian, and the Nobody's, re
spectively. On "Closed," slated for release
on March 26, Drag The River creates 14
tracks of authentic, heartfelt alternative
country music clocking in at under 40
minutes, a very punk output.

The tracks on "Closed" are pure shit
kicker country, songs about the open
road, faithless women, loneliness, tobac
co and booze. Lots of booze. In fact, if
anything, it seems like the boys from
Drag The River — in trying to establish
their hillbilly credentials — may have
been writing lyrics out of a "Hank
Williams for Dummies" manual, as some
of the lines seem to try to squeeze in as
many references to alcohol, Jesus and
heartache as possible.
Consider the opening from "Smokefin
ger," their final track: "If the whiskey
don't kill you / The smokefinger will / I've
been driving all night / Drinking down
pills/ If you don't change your ways / In
Hell you will burn." Not bad, but not par
ticularly groundbreaking either.
Some gems do exist, however. On the
album's best song, not-sui prisingly titled
"Get Drunk," Price humorously recounts
all the things he loves and the one thing he
doesn't, his woman. "I love to get drunk /1

love the movies / 1 love my
TV, my couch and my VCR /
Love the way the sun reflects
oft the hood of my car / But I
don't love you anymore."
Musically, the band relies
heavily on the pedal steel gui-

tar of guest musician Zach Boddicker, the
only non-punk of the group. Boddicker's
pickings are perfect, imparting precisely
the right amount of twang without over
bearing Nobody's bass or Rucker's drums.
Price's deep, gravelly vocals are a terrific
complement to the group's backwoods
sound, very reminiscent of Brian Henne
man's vocals with alt-country supergroup
The Bottle Rockets.
On a few songs, particularly the afore
mentioned "Get Drunk," the boys do
crank up the electric guitars and exhibit
flashes of their punk-rock roots, but over
all the band opts fora more sedate, bitter
sweet sound to match their subject matter.
Clearly, Drag The River is not content

to be merely a punk-rock
side project, but rather
aspires to be a complete
musical departure from
punk. It shows. There is
almost none of the trade
mark feedback, distor-

t ion or teen angst characteristic of the
group's other musical genre.
When asked about the appeal of coun
try music, former Uncle Tupelo front
man and godfather of the alt-country
genre Jeff Tweedy — previously a punk
rock devotee — said, "Eventually I found
myself very attracted to the darkness in a
lot of [traditional country] songs. I re
member having a revelation at some
point that that music was scarier than
Henry Rollins could ever be."
Apparently, the guys in Drag The River
have come to the same revelation. And
since that revelation resulted in "Closed,"
it's something that music fans should be
grateful for.
