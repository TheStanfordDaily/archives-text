# Get hot and bothered this spring
## 
### 
It's getting hot, the guys are getting hotter and we girls are at
our hottest. We sure love summer; beautiful legs are uncovered
from long pants to show their freshly waxed, lotioned, not-yet
quite tanned silhouette in way-too-short skirts; and well-ronnd
ed breasts are unpeeled from turtleneck sweaters and placed into
almost sheer, light, silky, and very, very tight tops. As this display
of nature's beauty unfolds, guys are forced to wear ever-larger
shorts to camouflage their excitement — about the beautiful
weather, of course.
As exciting as sex in the snow or in front of a fireplace can be,
who gets an erection when it's absolutely freezing and you are
lying on your back on ice? And Stanford doesn't even allow us to

have candles in our rooms! But think of all those new and ex
citing places that can be tried in summer.
Imagine the following scene: you sneak into de Guerre

pool at night. The air is still warm, with that delicious smell
of hot grass in the air. As you tilt your head back to look at
the stars, she dives down and shows her great breath-hold
ing talent. And afterwards, the diving board can be such an

o
excitingly dangerous alterna-

tive to the

boring old dorm room floor.
Or, if you prefer it dry — somewhere in the shade between one
of the Quad buildings, after having had a romantic kiss in the cir
cle of roses by Mem And, you gently lean her against the brick
walls and start working your magic. For those of you into
bondage, the ivy that covers most of the quad walls is a natural
replacement for handcuffs. If you prefer it a little extremer,
there is a ton of poison ivy at Jasper Ridge.
Another possibility: Caltrain, your girlfriend, wearing a sexy
mini, with nothing under it. Caltrain is so crowded that she has
to sit on your lap. As the bump in your shorts bulges out fur
ther, she discretely opens the zipper, perhaps to cool you down
a little? Hut it just makes you sweat more, especially when you
feel her deliciously moist lower lips touch you down there. And
with every bump in the track you feel her opening up a little
more. Think of the trouble such an act would cause in heavy
clothed winter!
If you aren't into the public transportation scene, what
about an open-decked ride in your convertible. You race down
Route 280, the wind is blowing in you hair and she divides her
attention betwen the gear-shift and you. Since you don't want
to cum on your new leather seats, you drive into the foothills.
You place your 'picnic' blanket behind some remote bush and
move on to desert.
But beware of early swim-team practice times, the dean
pulling a late night, ticket takers, sunburns, allergies, bug bites
and cops.
