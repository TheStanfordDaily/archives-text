# Play recreates Jesus' last days
## Student-led production is the first of its kind 
### BRENDAN MARTEN 
Beginning noon this Sunday in
Memorial Court, nine students
and chaplains from the Lutheran
and Episcopalian Ministries will
present a "Passion play" titled
"Passio Domini," or " The Suffer
ing of the Lord."
The play retells the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ and
details occurrences in Jesus' last
days, including the Last Supper,
the Garden of Gethsemane and
the decision to crucify him.
"This production is the first of
its kind in Stanford's history," said
Rev. Richard Foster, one of the
chaplains assisting in the play's
production.
The idea of presenting a Passion
play was originally conceived by ju
nior Matthew Griffin, a Stanford

drama major.
"Matthew has been the chief en
gine of this effort, from the begin
ning to the end," Foster said.
Griffin felt it would be especially
appropriate to have this perfor
mance during winter quarter and
the season of Lent.
"The timing of the story is im
portant, for [Lent] is a time of re
flection and purification," Grif
fin said.
In fact, Griffin's primary pur
pose in carrying out the play is
to provide a "religious journey
for actors."
"I originally recruited partici
pants for an exploration of faith, a
journey of looking at a particular
passage from the Bible," Griffin
said.
The group examined how writ
ers from different places and time
periods portrayed the story of
Jesus' last days.
"In preparation for the perfor
mance we sifted through texts, fex

plored] them and [talked] about
the strengths and weaknesses of
each," Griffin said.
The group finally decided to
base its script on a medieval 12th
century text from Montecassino, a
monastic community in Italy.
1 lowever, with such an old piece of
writing, there were a few complica
tions.
"Matt had to fill in a couple
parts himself," Foster said.
According to Griffin, the per
formance is intended to be a reli
gious journey for the audience as
well as the actors.
"It is an interactive play, meant
to elicit response," Griffin said. "It
invites the audience to make a
judgment."
Griffin said that he hopes on
lookers watching the play are en
couraged to have a spiritual expe
rience of their own.
"If they don't already know the

them some idea of what it was,
and an opportunity to relive it,"

removed any anti-Semitic refer
ences he could identify in the me
dieval text.
"Twelfth-century Italy [was] a
different time and place from
today," Griffin said. "There are bi
ases inherent in that time period
too, just as there are biases from
our historical context."
Overall, the group is optimistic
and excited about its upcoming
performance on Sunday.
"It should be a wonderful ex
perience for all involved," Foster
said.
