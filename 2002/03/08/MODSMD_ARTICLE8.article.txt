The first rounds of judging for
the Stanford Entrepreneur's

preneur's Challenge took place
Feb. 22 and Feb. 25.
The Entrepreneur's Chal
lenge is an annual business-plan
competition sponsored by
BASES and aimed at encourag
ing the next generation of entre
preneurs.
E-Challenge provides a sup
portive environment for partici
pants to learn about venture for
mation and explore their entre
preneurial ambitions.
The E-Challenge has tradi
tionally included three business
types — hardware, software and
biomedical. This year, a new com
petition called the Social E-Chal
lenge was created to judge social
ly conscious for-profit and non
profit startups.
Stanford students, research
and postdoctoral staff and facul

ty are eligible to enter. Individu
als unaffiliated with Stanford can
also participate, as long as at least
half of the team members are
from Stanford.
This year, the E-Challenge and
Social E-Challenge each received
30 executive summaries and de
tailed business plans from teams.
Fifteen plans were named semi-fi
nalists. Semi-finalists are now
completing entries for the next
round of the competition.
"I was really impressed with the
plans," said Don Howard of the
Bridgespan Group. "Each one of
them had a real social impact they
were creating and had pretty well
thought-out business models."
Winners of the first round
were announced at a Ven
tureFest panel. Questions were
addressed to the panelists by au
dience members and by Fast
Company magazine Senior Edi
tor George Anders, who moder
ated the panel.
Panelists included Morgen
thaler Ventures general partner

Drew Lanza, Com Ventures ven
ture partner Perry Wu and Atlas
Venture associate Adam Nash.
"I think [the Social E-Chal
lenge] is very valuable and I
would have liked to see the en
trepreneurs give presentations
on how they plan to overcome
obstacles," said Marguerite
Wilbur, chief operating officer
of Joint Venture: Silicon Valley
Network.
During the final round of the
E-Challenges this spring, finalist
teams will present their business
ideas to a panel of venture capi
talists. A $25,000 grand prize en
dowed by the Morgenthaler
Family and an additional
$50,000 will be split among the
remaining finalists.
"Thecompanies who will make
it are the ones who are delivering
products so worthwhile that they
fare] still bought in the market,"
Nash said. "Don't underestimate
the people around you here, the
people you're working with in
contests like this one."
