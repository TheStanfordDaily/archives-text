# Petition stops change in Stern parking lot
## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stern Hall residents circulated a petition last
weekend to protest the decision to set aside 50
East-Residence-permit parking slots exclusively
for A-permit holders in the Stern lot. After
being informed about students' protests, Park
ing & Transportation Services decided Monday
not to implement the change.
After senior Alisha Niehaus, a resident assis
tant in Donner, saw the flyers notifying Stern
residents of the policy change, she started draft
ing a petition. Niehaus estimates that 200 stu
dents signed the petition, while about 40 stu
dents sent e-mails to Parking Services express
ing concerns.
Originally, 235 spaces in the Stern lot were
open to both East Residence and A-permit hold
ers. A-permits are not available for sale to resi
dent students and cost $450 a year. The deci
sion to convert the first two rows of the lot to ex
clusive "A" spaces came as a shock to many Stern
residents who have already had problems try
ing to find parking.
"Some of my friends have said that they take
45 minutes to an hour to park in Stern," said se
nior Colin Mathewson, a Donner RA. "It's
amazing."
If more spaces were taken away, students
would start turning to more desperate mea
sures, according to Niehaus.

"The real issue is when students are going
to have to park illegally just to find a spot or
just so they won't be late to class," Niehaus
said.
In the petition, Niehaus made an appeal to
the University and its interest in its students.
"We feel that Stanford University, which
should function for its students, in this case has
completely discounted our interests," Niehaus
said. "We pay a very high tuition for access to
courses and activities for intellectual growth,
and it is lamentable that we should be prevent
ed from our academic undertakings in the con
stant search for parking."
Mathewson, who helped Niehaus organize
her efforts, was also disappointed in the lack of
communication between the Parking Services
and students.
"It was a policy that was ill-placed and didn't
give students even a chance to provide any
input," Mathewson said. "It's unacceptable to
make a policy change without asking the people
it will affect the most first."
However, Mathewson found that the Parking
Services was very "receptive" to student con
cerns. Niehaus and Mathewson met with Park
ing Services Manager Greg Gleichman Tuesday
to discuss the parking issue.
Gleichman said that there has recently been
an increasing demand for"A" spaces, especially
since overall parking around campus has be
come tighter. Construction of the new student

services building displaced about 50 "A" spaces,
which transportation services hoped to com
pensate for by creating exclusive "A" spaces in
the Stern lot.
According to Niehaus, Gleichman also ad
mitted that Stanford has an antiquated parking
system. While the proposed change was a short
term solution, Parking Services is trying to think
of new long-term solutions.
"It's good to hear that people in the Univer
sity are listening to the students," Niehaus said.
In an e-mail reiterating (lie issues discussed in
the meeting, Gleichman expressed his willing
ness to work with students to resolve the current
parking dilemma.
"I appreciate your offer to help improve
communication and understanding of park
ing issues with students," Gleichman said.
"Other members of our department have
been meeting with student representatives re
garding Marguerite service and I understand
that the students have expressed an interest in
broadening this discussion to include parking
issues."
Gleichman also added that parking services
is currently studying sites for new parking
structures in the East Campus area and that
plans are already underway to add surface
parking in that area over the summer.
"More parking should give us more flexibili
ty to better meet everyone's needs in the fu
ture," Gleichman said.
