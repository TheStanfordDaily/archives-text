On March 13, 1996, The Daily printed an ar
ticle about the Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity Program.
"The University committee charged with cre
ating the Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity program revealed specifics about the pro
posal on Monday but said the final product may
not be in place until (all of 1997.
"History Prof. A1 Camarillo, who chairs the
committee, told a group of 20 people that stu
dents will be able to minor and possibly major in
Native American Studies when the CSRE pro
gram is implemented. Camarillo also said stu
dents who want to major in African and Afro-
American Studies will not have to take the core
courses required in the CSRE curriculum, a
change from the initial plan.
"In addition, Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven clarified yester
day that Chicano Studies, Afro-American Stud
ies and Asian-American Studies will likely be
considered majors, not concentrations within
the CSRE major.
" 'While the design has changed in the actual
implementation of the program, we haven't
changed the views about it,' Shoven said. 'It's still
going to be innovative with an emphasis on issues
and social sciences.'
"At Monday night's meeting, Camarillo out
lined the program's structure for the first time.
"Fielding questions about different compo
nents of the program, Camarillo explained that
students either majoring or minoring in all the
areas except Afro-American Studies will be re
quired to go through a core of CSRE classes —
three courses are required to major, two to
minor."
Bottom Line: Steps to diversify the University's curriculum
are newer than you'd think.
