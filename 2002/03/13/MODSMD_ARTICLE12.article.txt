Afghan girl from famous
photo tracked down
WASHINGTON (AP) — Seventeen years ago, an
Afghan girl orphaned and living in a refugee camp
appeared on the cover of National Geographic, her
eyes big and green, a red scarf draped loosely over
her hair.
Now, the magazine says it has tracked down the
subject of that famous photo, a wife and mother liv
ing in a remote part of Afghanistan, and will once
again feature her in its April issue focusing on the
plight of refugees.
The girl, whose parents had been killed by bomb
ing during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, was pho
tographed in 1984 at the Nasir Bagh refugee camp in
Pakistan by Steve McCurry.
She was believed to be about 13 at the time, said
spokeswoman Ellen Siskind, which would make her
29 or 30 now.
The original photograph also was on the cover of
a best-selling special edition that National Geograph
ic published last fall of its 100 best photographs over
the years.
