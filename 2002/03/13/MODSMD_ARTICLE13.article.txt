### MICHELLE KELLER 
Three panelists involved in re
forming education in the Bay Area
spoke Monday night at the Center
for Educational Research at Stan
ford in a discussion titled, "Starting
a New School: the Inspiration and
the Challenge."
The panel was composed of
three School of Education alumni
engaged in creating and directing
small schools — Nicky Ramos-
Beban, the co-director of East
Palo Alto High School, Chris
Bischof, the founder and director
of Eastside Preparatory and Steve
Jubb, the executive director of the
Bay Area Coalition for Equitable
Schools.
The panel was moderated by
Education Prof. Linda Darling-
Hammond, the director of the Cal
ifornia School Redesign Network.
She spoke about the challenges
now facing the CCalifornia education
system. She also questioned the
panelists on their experiences fac
ing such challenges.
Hamilton pointed out what she
said were some staggering statis
tics about the California school

system, notably that California
schools are currently ranked third
to last in terms of pupil achieve
ment and receive a yearly average
of $5,500 per student, an amount
greater than only 12 other states.
The panelists spoke about their
experiences iu developing and
running small schools, and the re
wards and lessons they had gained.
Bischof emphasized that setting
high standards and expectations
for Eastside students — while at the
same time creating a personalized
educational environment — had
proven critical for student success.
Ramos-Beban echoed Bischof s
assertion concerning the person
alization available at smaller
schools. Ramos-Beban said per
sonalization creates a closer com
munity where teachers, students
and parents are able to constantly
interact through programs such
as the advisory system.
The panelists also addressed
Hammond's question about why
they were pushing for the creation
of newer, smaller schools. Jubb
fought back tears as he relayed his

frustrations in working with the bu
reaucracy of other school districts.
"I just couldn't stand by and

watch how our system was failing
our students massively," Jubb said.
"Something was dreadfully wrong .
... it wasn't the people 1 was [work
ing] with. The system is stacked
against the kids and the adults.
"You couldn't have planned it
better to keep people from suc

ceeding."
Jubb pointed out that in a large
Oakland high school, only 250
students graduated from of an ini
tial class of 700. Working through
the coalition, which assists urban
schools, school districts and com
munity groups in creating or re

designing their schools, Jubb has
been able to create six smaller
schools in Oakland that have ex
perienced more success than larg
er schools.
An audience member raised a
question about the role of teachers
in smaller schools and about how

the panelists were able to organize
people and resources differently
to achieve their goals.
Ramos- Beban said that East Palo
Alto High School had dealt with the
broadening of teachers' roles by
hiring experts — such as literacy or
English as a Second Language spe

cialists — who were then able to
train teachers.
The speakers noted that they
have spent all numerous long days
working at new schools to solve the
many issues faced by students and
faculty but that they found their
jobs extremely rewarding.
