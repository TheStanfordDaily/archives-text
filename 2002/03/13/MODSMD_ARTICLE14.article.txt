# Noam Chomsky to speak in Palo Alto
## Controversial scholar to address issues of post-Sept. 11 world 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
MIT Linguistics Prof. Noam
Chomsky, one of the most influen
tial and outspoken critics of Amer
ican media and government, will
be making an appearance in a
speech at 7:30 p.m. on Friday ti
tled, "Peering Into the Abyss of
the Future."
With 78 books and numerous
articles and lectures to his name,
Chomsky has inspired respect and
controversy for his extensive ef

forts in finding unique perspec
tives on global issues and re
searching information that has
not penetrated the media.
" Judged in terms of the power,
range, novelty and influence of his
thought, Noam Chomsky is ar
guably the most important intel
lectual alive," said an article in The
New York Times. "Since that's the
case, how can he write such terri
ble things about American foreign
policy?"
According to Assoc. Prof, of
Classics and Drama Rush Rehm,
many of Chomsky's works deal
with the issues involved in "manu
factured consent."
"[Manufactured consent is] the
idea that what citizens actually
know is merely a small fraction of

what really goes on in the world,"
Rehm said. "Much of Chomsky's
career has been built around the
argument that the American
media and government distort or
refuse to give information on rele
vant issues throughout the world.
"He's a voice of sanity in the
midst of a crazy world," said
Rehm, who teaches a Sophomore
Seminar titled, "Noam Chomsky:
The Drama of Resistance." "He
speaks of a lot things that get
buried, including bodies."
"We think that Chomsky has
been an incredibly important
voice to listen to — one that
tries to think critically about
these issues," said junior Calvin
Miaw, co-coordinator of the
Stanford Community for Peace

and Justice, which is sponsoring
the event."He uses sources of in
formation that you don't normal
ly find in mainstream media and
he discusses opinions that nor
mally [remain] unspoken by the
commentators in the mainstream
media."
"I think one of the most power
ful aspects of Chomsky's analysis is
his pretty strict reliance on infor
mation that really is in the public
records but is hidden away," said
Paul George, executive director of
the Peninsula Peace and Justice
Center, the organization hosting
the speech. "A good part of our
mission is educating people about
a deeper analysis of what is going
on, so they can see through the
mainstream media."
Chomsky will be speaking at
the Camino Ballroom at Rickey's
Hyatt House in Palo Alto. All
1,000 tickets were sold the first day
they were available.

Chomsky first became famous
for his advancements in the field
of linguistics before becoming a
common name in American
households with his outspoken
criticisms of the Vietnam War
and his continual efforts to reveal
biases in the media and show how
governments try to influence the
opinions of people.
By sponsoring a controversial
political critic like Chomsky, SCPJ

hopes that Stanford students and
community members will come
away new ideas about important
global issues, Miaw said.
"Even though Chomsky takes
some extreme views which I do
not agree with, I think that it is es
pecially important for us as stu
dents to try and attend this event,"
freshman Kea Gilbert said. "Be
cause it's so easy to get trapped in
the Stanford bubble, I am reallv

excited to hear about crucial cur
rent events from new perspec
tives, ones which I would not nor
mally get simply by reading the
paper."
Chomsky's lecture is expected
to cover a wide range of issues, ac
cording to George.
"In general he will taking a look
at the post-[Sept. 11 ] world, the so
called war on terrorism and all kinds
of unpleasantries," George said.
