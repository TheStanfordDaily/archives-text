Chomsky, one of the most influen
tial and outspoken critics of Amer
ican media and government, will
be making an appearance in a
speech at 7:30 p.m. on Friday ti
tled, "Peering Into the Abyss of
the Future."
With 78 books and numerous
articles and lectures to his name,
Chomsky has inspired respect and
controversy for his extensive ef

forts in finding unique perspec
tives on global issues and re
searching information that has
not penetrated the media.
" Judged in terms of the power,
range, novelty and influence of his
thought, Noam Chomsky is ar
guably the most important intel
lectual alive," said an article in The
New York Times. "Since that's the
case, how can he write such terri

Classics and Drama Rush Rehm,
many of Chomsky's works deal
with the issues involved in "manu

Rehm said. "Much of Chomsky's
career has been built around the

Rehm, who teaches a Sophomore
Seminar titled, "Noam Chomsky:
The Drama of Resistance." "He
speaks of a lot things that get
buried, including bodies."
"We think that Chomsky has
been an incredibly important
voice to listen to â€” one that
tries to think critically about
these issues," said junior Calvin
Miaw, co-coordinator of the
Stanford Community for Peace

and Justice, which is sponsoring
the event."He uses sources of in
formation that you don't normal
ly find in mainstream media and
he discusses opinions that nor
mally [remain] unspoken by the
commentators in the mainstream
media."
"I think one of the most power
ful aspects of Chomsky's analysis is
his pretty strict reliance on infor
mation that really is in the public
records but is hidden away," said
Paul George, executive director of
the Peninsula Peace and Justice
Center, the organization hosting
the speech. "A good part of our
mission is educating people about
