# Law School hosts debate on slavery reparations
## Professors Ogletree and McWhorter speak from opposing viewpoints 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last night, Stanford Law School hosted a de
bate on slavery reparations between Stanford
graduates Charles Ogletree, a Harvard Law
School professor and activist, and John
McWhorter, a UC-Berkeley linguistics profes
sor and author.
Ogletree, who is leading a legal effort to
win "trillions of dollars" in reparations from
the U.S. government and corporations, ar
gued that reparations were necessary to ad
dress three issues. Ogletree cited the evil of
slavery, the pervasive impact of segregation,
and the continuing legacy of discrimination
as wrongs that should be addressed through
reparations.
Ogletree proposed that the money not be
handed out to African Americans directly, but
rather used to set up a trust fund to finance
programs aimed at improving blacks' position
in America.
"We still have a dual society," Ogletree said.
"There's something fundamental about our
system . . . you can't explain as other than con
tinuing discrimination."
Ogletree pointed out that inner-city schools
are more segregated and worse off than they
were 70 years, ago, and that over half of prison
ers in America are black, even though black men
comprise less than 10 percent of the population.

"America owes a debt to African Americans
and it hasn't been paid," Ogletree said.
McWhorter — while acknowledging in
equities between blacks and whites — main
tained that "it's not necessary for [reparations]

to occur for us to get ahead."
McWhorter argued that many reparations
had already been made, in particular the Civil
Rights Act, affirmative action and welfare.
McWhorter argued that reparations would
not address the important issues facing .African
Americans today.
"There comes a point when you can't just
hand them the money," McWhorter said. "No
body can rise unless they are self-empowered,
and if you're handed a check, you're not self
empowered."
Both men agreed that African Americans
needed help, but disagreed about how it should
be administered.
McWhorter said that the reparations battle
and its subsequent trust fund was not an effec
tive solution.
"We can litigate reparations and still fight
against racial profiling and other forms of dis
crimination," Ogletree said.
After each professor spoke and responded to
the other's speech, the floor was opened up for
questions from the audience.
One member asked why McWhorter felt
programs funded by reparations would not
be successful.
"It's not that I don't think there should be
such programs," McWhorter said. "It's that
these problems aren't addressed by money but
by changing people's perceptions."
Ogletree responded to a question about the
ethical ideology behind his lifelong push for
reparations.
"It's not simply about the money, but [it's
about] trying to solve a problem that has exist
ed for centuries," Ogletree said. "You can't just
apologize for it, you've got to repair it."
