## The 						Stanford Daily Should Stanford join the Workers' Rights Consortium? 
### 
Published Since 1891

Stanford should support its student
athletes' petition to hold corpora
tions such as Nike to the same ethical
ideals it espouses in the Fundamen
tal Standard.
The petition, signed by 112 student-ath
letes, calls for Stanford to join the Workers'
Rights Consortium — a non-profit organiza
tion dedicated to protecting the rights of fac
tory workers who produce athletic apparel for
companies like Nike, which supply college
sports teams with their gear.
The petition does not ask Stanford to re
peal its contract with Nike, nor does it require
Stanford to give up its current association
with the Fair Labor Association and its code of
conduct. The petition merely prompts Stan
ford to also support the WRC, which does not
permit members of the corpo

rations it monitors to sit on its
board of directors. In this way,
the WRC avoids many con
flicts of interests that may
arise with the FLA.

PRO

Provost John Etchemendy's
comment that Stanford only joins organiza
tions when they represent the school's core in
terests — "namely education and research" —
does not hold much merit, considering the
University's already-existing relationship with
the FI A, whose mission statement does not in
clude the promotion of research or education.
Since Etchemendy cites Stanford's policy
"against joining organizations that have other
purposes" as a reason not to join the WRC,
perhaps the University has failed to recognize
the FLA's primary purpose.
The primary difference between the FLA
and the WRC is the issue of corporate moni
toring versus independent monitoring. Stan
ford's hesitation to support such monitoring is
suspect. The WRC has been successful at

working with corporations such as Nike to ad
dress various code-of-conduct violations while
allowing schools to maintain their funding
from the corporations.
Thus far, over 80 other colleges and univer
sities have become members of WRC, includ
ing Columbia, Georgetown, Cornell and the
entire University of California system. Yale,
Harvard and Stanford are among the most
notable holdouts.
The petition challenges the University to
reexamine the importance of the Fundamen
tal Standard, which begins: "Students are ex
pected to show both within and without the
University such respect for order and morali
ty." There is a note of hypocrisy in this stan
dard in that only students are required to hold
themselves to this standard — not the Univer
sity as an institution. The Fun

damental Standard should
apply not only to students but
also to the faculty and admin
istration and to Stanford's cor
porate alliances.

By not requiring its corpo
rate affiliates to hold themselves to this stan
dard of ethics and morals, Stanford implicitly
states that it expects its students to have high
er morals than the non-Stanford population.
Stanford should have equally high expecta
tions of its afFiliates and corporate alliances.
Stanford should heed its student-athletes'
call to join the WRC. With this move, the
University would begin to hold itself to the
same standards of morality to which it holds
its students.
By joining a watchdog organization free of
corporate ties, the University can not only play
a role in improving the work conditions of
those who produce the clothing, but at the
same time ensure that its athletes will be proud
to wear it.

The 112 Stanford student-athletes
who recently signed a petition call
ing for the University to join the
Workers' Rights Consortium should
be applauded for their desire to support
human rights and hold accountable the Nike
Corporation, which supplies their athletic
wardrobes. But joining the WRC is not the way
to accomplish these goals.
The W r RC maintains that its purpose is "to
assist in the enforcement of manufacturing
Codes of Conduct adopted by colleges and
universities." These codes are designed to
ensure that factories give their workers,
among other things, basic protections for
contract rights and safe working conditions.
Stanford, however, is already a member of
an independent organization pursuing pre

cisely the same goals, called
the Fair Labor Association.
On balance, the FLA is a
better vehicle for ensuring
responsible corporate be
havior than the WRC.
The Fair Labor Associa-

CON

tion endorses virtually the same code of con
duct as the WRC, including prohibition of
forced labor, child labor, harassment and
abuse. The WRC and FLA both insist on
nondiscrimination in hiring and promotion,
as well as freedom of association and collective
bargaining, fair wages, a 48-hour work week
and proper overtime compensation. In fact,
the WRC adopted these standards after the
Fair Labor Association, because the FLA came
first and is far better established.
Formed in 1999 following a White House
initiative to bring together labor and industry,
the FLA is a non-profit organization com
prised of human rights, labor, religious and
consumer groups, as well as college and cor
porate representatives. The FLA counts over

170 major colleges and universities as mem
bers, as well as the National Consumers'
League, the National Council of Churches
and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center
for Human Rights.
Some Stanford athletes have objected to the
presence of corporate representatives in the
FLA. Apparel corporations, including Nike,
do have six of the 14 seats on the FLA's board
of directors. Yet corporate presence could be
characterized as a strength of the FLA rather
than a shortcoming.
Most of the factories in developing coun
tries where the goods for major corporate la
bels are produced are not owned by the cor
porations themselves. Company cooperation
in gaining access to these factories for inspec
tions and on-site interviews, especially when

the inspections are unan
nounced, as most FLA in
spections are, is indispens
able. The WRC can com
mand no such cooperation
and cannot gain such unfet
tered access.

Further, unless parent companies are in
volved in the system of compliance and mon
itoring, local factories have little incentive to
change offensive practices and protect their
workers. Neither the FLA nor the WRC is a
governmental body — neither can force
compliance. Corporations who hold con
tracts with local factories can force compli
ance, however, and as members of the FLA
— enmeshed in an accountability network of
human rights groups, religious organiza
tions and participating universities — it is in
their interest to do so.
The FLA surely has its problems and
shortcomings. But it remains a better instru
ment for meaningful protection of workers
than the WRC.
