# CANNONBALL COMING
## Pool choices for the mad 
### 
Over here at The Daily, we pride
ourselves on originality. That's
why I'm writing a column on
March Madness.
Below lies all the information you will
need to comprehend the coming three
weeks of sporting mayhem and earn all of
your friends' money in the numerous ille
gal on-campus betting pools. Though I

have never won a pool —
not even the four-person
family pool my dad has
run for the last 15 years
of my life — and my bas
ketball skills could be de
scribed as poor to quite
poor, I am positive that
these observations will
prove quite helpful.

Therefore, in random order:
Safest Championship Pick: Duke.
That's the only team Stanford students
know about anyway. So, go ahead, put
them down on every line and when people
ask why, say: "L'hh, Duke's good, huh?"
Best Championship Pick: Unfortu
nately, it's another ACC team — Mary
land. Their bracket is weak and they're
more than good enough to win it all with
out any help.
Worst Championship Pick: Stan
ford. I know some of you are going to do
this. You feel compelled to put us down
on the bracket, because you'd feel like a
bad fan if you didn't. That's fine when
we're a No. 1 or No. 2 seed. But, we're
not. Because we're not that good. I'll be
in front of the television cheering Stan
ford on every game, but we won't win
more than a game. And this time, I'm
not being sarcastic, Teyo.
Whitest First-Round Matchup: Duke
vs. Winthrop. It sounds like a final-round
pairing in the Westchester Country
Club's annual Father-Son Best-Ball
Tournament. I mean, this game's
straight out of Trading Places. If we can

get Randolph Duke in here, we've got
the full power of I)uke & Duke, Inc. at
our disposal. Frozen orange juice fu
tures are looking up.
Worst School Name: Central Con
necticut State. If Connecticut were
Texas, this wouldn't be funny. But how
many regions can you have in a state the
size of my desk? Once they join up with
their other cold-blooded, cod-fishing,
jimmy-eating friends, they can be
known as Southern New England State.
But as long as they continue to live in a
state the size of a shoe, they get one
school and one school only: Fairfield.
Ugliest Player in the Tournament:
Most of the real uglies, like Victor Page,
Sam Cassell, Bryant Reeves and Shane
Battier (Shar-pei head himself) have
moved onto (he NBA. So Shantay
Legans, Cal's point guard, is the fill-in.
He's short, bald and has a set of huge
ears. He's no Hedo Turkoglu, but he's
still damn ugly.
Easiest Team to Root Against (Other
than Duke): With the Dookies eliminat
ed from consideration, I'll have to go
with UC-Santa Barbara. Surprisingly,
the Gauchos took enough time off from
surfing, eating tacos, strumming their
ukuleles and listening to the latest copy of
Jack Johnson Five to play some ball. As
long as they continue to have hotter
chicks, better weather and a more relaxed
attitude than I do, I will root against Santa
Barbara. My jealousy knows no bounds.
Worst Team: Cat. I hey blow. They
beat us once this year, finished higher in
the Pac-10 and have a higher seed. But
have you watched them play? You think
our three games against USC were bad?
You're tight, they were awful. But Cal is
that bad on a nightly basis. I have no idea
how they won a game in the Pac-10.
They're supposed to be our rivals and I
can't name a player on that team other
than their point guard. And the only rea

son I know his name is because he's so
damn ugly.
Biggest Choking Dogs: Indiana. With
Bobby or without, the Hoosiers always
choke. Always.
Most Glaring Question: Does Tulsa
really have any chance to beat Mar
quette? Does anyone care? Just put a
name down. Either way the winner's not
getting past Kentucky.
Luckiest Seed: Oregon. They have
eight losses. For comparison, Stanford has
nine. Yet, until the Ducks get to the Elite
Eight, they have no one good sitting in
front of them.
Unluckiest Seed: Arizona. Arizona and
Oregon fought it out over the No. 2 seed
in the Midwest or the No. 3 in the West.
Oregon's regular season Pac-10 title and

sweep of the Wildcats gave them the No. 2.
Now'Zona has Gonzaga staring at it in the
second round and Oklahoma, which
should've been the No. 1 seed, in the
Sweet l(j. Get past that and either Cincin
nati, UCIA or Missouri is likely staring
them in the face. Sweet run.
Most Annoying Player: Desnion
Farmer. USC's super suh is neat ing Chris
Collins territory here. Farmer has a huge
set of chompers that he loves to share.
Fvery time he scores—first minute or last,
layup, free throw or three-pointer — he
raises his arms and screams. He pounds
the floor at every possible opportunity.
Fvery time he gets called lor a foul, he con
torts his face into pure disgust.
He is awful to watch and probably
worse to play against, which is why (JSC

will upset Duke. Or maybe Sam Clancy's
the reason. Either way, it's happening.
Once Santa Barbara loses, Duke has to go
clown too.
Well, that's it. I have helped absolutely
no one. You are all dumber for having
read this column.
Regardless, have a great time watching
the tournament.
And enjoy Spring Break. At least this
year, you won't have any Stanford games
intruding on your busy schedule.

Jonathan, a senior, hopes this will help Jire up

Over here at The Daily, we pride
ourselves on originality. That's
why I'm writing a column on
March Madness.
Below lies all the information you will
need to comprehend the coming three
weeks of sporting mayhem and earn all of
your friends' money in the numerous ille
gal on-campus betting pools. Though I

have never won a pool —
not even the four-person
family pool my dad has
run for the last 15 years
of my life — and my bas
ketball skills could be de
scribed as poor to quite
poor, I am positive that
these observations will
prove quite helpful.

Therefore, in random order:
Safest Championship Pick: Duke.
That's the only team Stanford students
know about anyway. So, go ahead, put
them down on every line and when people
ask why, say: "L'hh, Duke's good, huh?"
Best Championship Pick: Unfortu
nately, it's another ACC team — Mary
land. Their bracket is weak and they're
more than good enough to win it all with
out any help.
Worst Championship Pick: Stan
ford. I know some of you are going to do
this. You feel compelled to put us down
on the bracket, because you'd feel like a
bad fan if you didn't. That's fine when
we're a No. 1 or No. 2 seed. But, we're
not. Because we're not that good. I'll be
in front of the television cheering Stan
ford on every game, but we won't win
more than a game. And this time, I'm
not being sarcastic, Teyo.
Whitest First-Round Matchup: Duke
vs. Winthrop. It sounds like a final-round
pairing in the Westchester Country
Club's annual Father-Son Best-Ball
Tournament. I mean, this game's
straight out of Trading Places. If we can

get Randolph Duke in here, we've got
the full power of I)uke & Duke, Inc. at
our disposal. Frozen orange juice fu
tures are looking up.
Worst School Name: Central Con
necticut State. If Connecticut were
Texas, this wouldn't be funny. But how
many regions can you have in a state the
size of my desk? Once they join up with
their other cold-blooded, cod-fishing,
jimmy-eating friends, they can be
known as Southern New England State.
But as long as they continue to live in a
state the size of a shoe, they get one
school and one school only: Fairfield.
Ugliest Player in the Tournament:
Most of the real uglies, like Victor Page,
Sam Cassell, Bryant Reeves and Shane
Battier (Shar-pei head himself) have
moved onto (he NBA. So Shantay
Legans, Cal's point guard, is the fill-in.
He's short, bald and has a set of huge
ears. He's no Hedo Turkoglu, but he's
still damn ugly.
Easiest Team to Root Against (Other
than Duke): With the Dookies eliminat
ed from consideration, I'll have to go
with UC-Santa Barbara. Surprisingly,
the Gauchos took enough time off from
surfing, eating tacos, strumming their
ukuleles and listening to the latest copy of
Jack Johnson Five to play some ball. As
long as they continue to have hotter
chicks, better weather and a more relaxed
attitude than I do, I will root against Santa
Barbara. My jealousy knows no bounds.
Worst Team: Cat. I hey blow. They
beat us once this year, finished higher in
the Pac-10 and have a higher seed. But
have you watched them play? You think
our three games against USC were bad?
You're tight, they were awful. But Cal is
that bad on a nightly basis. I have no idea
how they won a game in the Pac-10.
They're supposed to be our rivals and I
can't name a player on that team other
than their point guard. And the only rea

son I know his name is because he's so
damn ugly.
Biggest Choking Dogs: Indiana. With
Bobby or without, the Hoosiers always
choke. Always.
Most Glaring Question: Does Tulsa
really have any chance to beat Mar
quette? Does anyone care? Just put a
name down. Either way the winner's not
getting past Kentucky.
Luckiest Seed: Oregon. They have
eight losses. For comparison, Stanford has
nine. Yet, until the Ducks get to the Elite
Eight, they have no one good sitting in
front of them.
Unluckiest Seed: Arizona. Arizona and
Oregon fought it out over the No. 2 seed
in the Midwest or the No. 3 in the West.
Oregon's regular season Pac-10 title and

sweep of the Wildcats gave them the No. 2.
Now'Zona has Gonzaga staring at it in the
second round and Oklahoma, which
should've been the No. 1 seed, in the
Sweet l(j. Get past that and either Cincin
nati, UCIA or Missouri is likely staring
them in the face. Sweet run.
Most Annoying Player: Desnion
Farmer. USC's super suh is neat ing Chris
Collins territory here. Farmer has a huge
set of chompers that he loves to share.
Fvery time he scores—first minute or last,
layup, free throw or three-pointer — he
raises his arms and screams. He pounds
the floor at every possible opportunity.
Fvery time he gets called lor a foul, he con
torts his face into pure disgust.
He is awful to watch and probably
worse to play against, which is why (JSC

will upset Duke. Or maybe Sam Clancy's
the reason. Either way, it's happening.
Once Santa Barbara loses, Duke has to go
clown too.
Well, that's it. I have helped absolutely
no one. You are all dumber for having
read this column.
Regardless, have a great time watching
the tournament.
And enjoy Spring Break. At least this
year, you won't have any Stanford games
intruding on your busy schedule.

Jonathan, a senior, hopes this will help Jire up
