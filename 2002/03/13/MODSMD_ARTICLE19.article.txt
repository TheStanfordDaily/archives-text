# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Yearning for Depends and bingo 
### CORINNE PURTILL STAFF COLUMNIST 
I read a story the other day about the
unusual case of Treva Throneberry,
a.k.a. Rrianna Stewart, a 28-year-old
woman who appeared in Vancouver,
Wash, a few years ago posing as a 16-year
old runaway. Despite the fact that in the
school picture accompanying the New York
Times Magazine article Throneberry looks
like a PTA president with pigtails, she en
rolled in a local high sch(X)l as a sophomore
and passed herself off as a teenager for three
years before die cops tracked her down.
This story caught my attention since it
is Dead Week, when leaving town and
changing identity does not seem like such
a bad idea. I am not saying that I would
ever be tempted into lying and fraud. I am
saying, however, that I would rather herd
yaks in the most remote regions of the Hi
malayas than study or write this column.
Did I say that out loud? Oops.
Here is my question: Of all the possible
alter-identities that a talented fraud could
adopt, why be a high school kid?
Maybe you really miss those days.
Maybe you were one of the people crying
on graduation day, while the rest of us were
sprinting towards the stadium gates with
our diplomas under our arms like footballs.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
I will admit to shedding some tears when
we threw our caps in the air. 1 will also
admit to being the only graduate to throw
my arms around the principal in the mid
dle of the ceremony in a fit of sheer joy.
High school was a pleasant enough
experience but one that doesn't need re
peating. I don't mind having my teeth
cleaned either, but it's not like I'm going
to sign up for extra shifts in the chair.
College is more fun than high school.
Treva (or Brianna, as she still demands to be
called) characterized the electrifying social
scene of her teenage friends as, "We would
just walk around the mall and look at stuff.
The conversation was like: 'What do you
wanna do?' 'I don't know, what do you

wanna do?"' Compare this to Stanford,
where you can sit in a dorm room full of in
telligent, articulate people and have veiy
similar conversations while bouncing quar
ters into cups of beer. Yeah college! Whooo!
The wise con artist would not bother
with high school. High school means rusty
lockers, curfews and girls who sign their
name with little hearts above the"i." If Bri
anna was really looking for the good life,
she would have gotten a wig, support hose
and a patent leather purse and gone out
into the world as an old lady.
With the exceptions of arthritis, some for
getfulness and the frequent deaths of your
friends, old age is where it's at. And its popu
larity is on the rise. People just aren't dying
like they used to. As a result, our population
is aging, suggesting a future in which kneel
ing buses will rule the streets and pinochle
will surpass hockey for airtime on ESPN.
Fora glimpse into our gray-haired
future, look at Palm Desert, California.
This idyllic little town is inhabited pri
marily by senior citizens, most of whom
live in neatly-manicured gated commu
nities with attractive fountains at the en
trance designed to distract the residents
from the fact that the world outside is a
barren, scorched wasteland.
In Palm Desert, the elderly rule. The
streets are named after old people's favorite
people, like Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra.
Handicapped spots take up the first three
rows of parking in the movie theater lot. The
restaurants serve soft, easily gummable food
ordered off of large-print menus. It is an el
derly Utopia, and while token features like el
ementary schools and a community college
indicate the presence of young people, it is
clear that the whole place is ruled by the wrin
kled hand of the retired.
My grandparents moved to Palm
Desert four years ago. In that time, their
social life has exploded in ways we would
not have thought possible when they still
hung out with dark-haired people. Left to
their own devices, old people do not toler
ate that "Clap-Along Fun Time Music
Hour" nursing home crap. Do not be

fooled by the pleasant smiles of the be
nign-looking old people tooling about in
golf carts decorated with fringe and little
flags. They are spry and shrewd.
The clubhouse in their neighborhood is
a hotbed of Machiavellian political maneu
vering. Meetings on topics like golf scores
and the maintenance of flowerbeds degen
erate into an atmosphere not unlike the
U.N. Security Council in the 19605.
My grandparents (who live off Dinah
Shore Blvd.) love it. My grandmother, who
was reported to have cried tears of joy
upon receiving a vacuum cleaner fora
birthday in the early 19705, has become a
mover and a shaker, the Katharine Gra
ham of the septuagenarian social scene.
Since moving, the woman who baked a
cake when Luke and I .aura got married on
"General Hospital" has joined the Garden
ing Club, the Lady Putters and the "Titty
Club,"a group of breast-cancer survivors
that meet once a month for lunch. "The
Vagina Monologues" is nothing compared
to a roomful of poofy-haired ladies with is
sues about their prosthetic boobs.
When I go to visit my grandparents,
time stops. I lie by the pool and wave to
bathers wearing swimming caps and skirt
ed floral bathing suits purchased sometime
during the Carter administration. 1 play
bingo at the Indian casino and sit next to
men wearing pants belted across their
chests and women in sweatshirts festooned
with gold-sequined tropical birds. I hang
out with people who have ill ready done
about 100 years of work in 70 years of life
and are now ready to tell everyone else to
screw off, except for their grandchildren.
That, my friends, is living.
I've kind of forgotten what the point of
this was, so I guess it's time to stop. If you
find yourself with nothing to do for spring
break, head down to Palm Desert. There's
a very nice couple there with a grandson
about your age that they'd like you to meet.
He goes to Berkeley. He wants to be a doc
tor. And, rumor has it, he is a very nice boy.
