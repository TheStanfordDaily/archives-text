# DANCING IN CIRCLES
## The 						other side of the sunrise 
### JEN WEKSELBAUM STAFF COLUMNIST 
How many times have you seen the other
side of the sunrise? Not the side where
yon wake up early and hike out to the
ocean with your friends to stand in awe at
the majestic view. I'm talking about the lonely side of
sunrise. The side where you've just spent all night in
the computer cluster writing a 10-page paper.
You smell bad, you feel like crap, your eyes are
blear)' and you just want to curl up and disappear.
But then you notice, through the blinds, the sky has
become a gorgeous shade of pink. The world is be
ginning to wake up, there is life beyond your paper.
Do you ever wonder, when you see that sunrise,
what are we doing it for? What are we pursuing that
we will voluntarily do this to our bodies?
Stanford is the envy of many around the world —
and yet parts of the lifestyle it breeds are so unhealthy.
But really, what's to complain about? I can see my
great-great-great grandmother turning in her grave. I
can hear her outrage: I toiled and suffered and starved
my life away. What do you think you're doing com
plaining?
But then again maybe she's saying: I toiled my life
away so that you wouldn't have to! Why do you cre
ate this artificial work for yourself? Why do you lead
this empty life?
Or maybe she couldn't care less.
Even if my great-great-great-grandmother is just
a figment of the romantic American imagination,
maybe she has a point. We're here in part because
someone, somewhere down the line, fought for our
opportunities. Coming to Stanford is a decision and
we're well aware that it's a privilege.
There is hardly any hardship that comes with this
particular position in society. Accordingly, we need
to make the most of the kinds of opportunities the
University has to offer. But we also have the privilege
of asking questions. Stanford gives most of us more

freedom than almost anyone in the world to shape
our lives in the ways we desire — is there any other
aspect of life we find important enough to develop?
The only thing I can think of is community. Most
of us left our communities— family, friends, neigh
bors— to come to Stanford in pursuit of an educa
tion. And while we're here, many of us do get to know
each other deeply and build communities.
But come graduation, what's gonna happen?
One friend's going to grad school in New York, an
other got a job in Tennessee. Some folks are going
home, some off to teach English abroad. Slowly the
community begins to unravel.
What are we pursuing out there? We're going
off to become consultants, engineers, nonprofit
professionals, teachers, organizers . . . you name it.
We have this zeal, this expectation that we will
make a difference.
.And work is important, for sure. Few of us will ever
have the luxury not to engage in it. But is it everything?
1 went to a panel once on "Balancing Work and
Family," organized by the Graduate Women's Net
work. Professors talked about how they handled the
stress of academia while trying to be good parents.
Priorities were what they emphasized.
And that's where I don't understand the kinds of
lives we tend to lead. Why does it seem so natural at the
end of college to leave behind the communities we've
built? A fellow student once told me, you make friends
in college expecting to lose them in the end. 1 don't
quite buy that — I don't think we intend to give our re
lationships second priority. But maybe we don't pay
enough attention to them, and it happens anyway.
On the other hand, what is it about community
that's so wonderful, we shouldn't leave it? Why should
we make it the top priority in our lives? 1 don't know.
It's a mystery, how to live a fulfilling life. Sometimes
it takes the delirious side of sunrise to remind us of the
question.
