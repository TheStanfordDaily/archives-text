# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## The
						pain of service during crisis 
### PATRICK LABELLE GUEST COLUMNIST 
Something has been on my mind this week and I
feel a need to speak about it in a public forum. I
had been tempted to ignore the issue on campus,
thinking that it might simply pass without notice.
But a news piece in The Daily ("Priests' misconduct has
economic costs," 3 / 6) has really forced my hand.
It is the issue of the national tragedy within the
Catholic Church of the years of sexual misconduct of
some of the clergy and, even worse, of the cover-up of
that conduct by church leaders. The Daily piece was
simply reporting the news — this is something that has
been happening for many years in many places
throughout the country — and perhaps beyond.
I have had personal experience with this matter, as
I have been the representative of the church on a few
panels and negotiating sessions between victims and
the priests who have taken advantage of their office
and the respect it commands through their violation
of trust and persons. There is no way that I can ex
plain the pain with which these sessions proceed.
There is pain on all sides, but most of all pain on the
part of the victim and their families.
In many cases the individuals and their families
leave the Church, mortally wounded by the injustice
done them. In most cases, however, they eventually re
alize that in the end it is their church and they have a
right to it that nothing — not even a wounded and
flawed clergy — can take away. In many situations,
these people become leaders and give me hope.
There is pain on the other side as well. The priests
involved are ill, and that illness, according to the most
reputable information, cannot be cured. They are des
tined to a life of unhappiness and suffering. While that
can never justify what they have done, it remains a cross
for them and for the whole Church to bear.
In some cases there are illegitimate accusations and
accusations which are overstated. But those cases are
the exceptions and not the rule. The blight on the min

istry of priestly service is real, and for the rest of us who
try hard to be good priests, it is devastating. In spite of
the fact that the number of such situations, I have been
told, is less than 1 percent of all priests active in this
country, it remains very public, very damaging and
very wrong.
But even worse has been the conduct of Church lead
ership in sidestepping the responsibility for dealing with
these situations for years. True, times are different and
we know more and behave differently than we did in the
past. But this behavior has never been right and treat
ment should never have been simply moving the per
son from place to place.
Certainly there will be great financial repercus
sions. There may be fewer young men who seek to
serve the Church through priestly ministry and there
may be a lack of respect and love for the clergy by the
people of God. There may continue to be a drop in
morale of the clergy at large because of the publicity
and reality of what has happened.
On the positive side, the Church is more aware
than it has ever been of the problems involved and has
made great advances in correcting the screening, for
mation and placement of clergy and the supervision,
reporting and treatment of clergy who abuse persons
on any level and in any way.
The rest of us must simply ask for your patience,
your prayers, your understanding and your love. We
will continue to give you our lives without reservation.
We will be at your disposal at all times and will do our
best to live up to all that you expect of us.
We are, remember, earthen vessels. We are sinners
as we all are sinners. We are honored to serve you and
we will do everything we can to continue to fulfill the
difficult task of trying to be representatives of Christ in
your midst. The vast majority of us will continue to
earn your trust. With God's grace and your support we
will clean house and move on to a better tomorrow.
