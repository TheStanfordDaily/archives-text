# Jersey shore becomes romantic crab breeding ground

### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Full Moon on the ... Atlantic Ocean?
Horseshoe crabs in New Jersey seem to
have been following their own tradition
eons before Stanford students. Every
year, thousands of horseshoe crabs leave
the depths of the ocean to mate under the
light of a full moon. The reason for this is
that full moons cause higher tides, which
push the crabs onto the beach. When the
tides ebb, the crabs are washed back into
the sea.
The full moon is also a feast for laugh
ing gulls. The birds feed on newly laid
eggs, sometimes doubling their weight.
The New Jersey Division of Fish and
Wildlife calculated that some birds travel
as many as 11,000 miles and eat 300 tons
of eggs during their stay. All, the roman
ticism of a full moon.
Thought the bathroom down the hall
contained the worst smell you have ever
experienced? Try the Monell Chemical
Senses Center in Philadelphia next time.
Researchers there received a grant
from the Department of Defense three
years ago to develop a non-lethal "odor
bomb." The group focused on biological
sources because they thought these had
the best chances of universal recognition.
Tests have elected two winners —
human fecal waste and rotting food. The
first contains skatoles, white crystalline
compounds normally found in feces and
used as a fixative in perfumes. The latter
contains butyric acid, a viscous rancid liq
uid used in manufacturing plastic and
various sulfurous decay by-products.
Building an operating system fora
single computer is a real tour de force.
Building one for all the computers in the
world seems impossible. But that is ex
actly what some computer scientists have
in mind.
David P. Anderson and John Kunia
towicz of UC-Berkeley explained the
idea of an operating system spanning
the entire Internet in the March issue of
Scientific American. The Internet-scale
operating system could exploit the idle
computing time of 150 million machines
to perform work. The two principal ben
eficiaries would be data processing tasks
such as simulations and data analyses,

and online services such as databases
and file storage.
The real challenge, of course, is of
fering protection to individual users
and avoiding bugs that would crash the
system.

Most people have probably heard of
cerebral aneurysms but do not know ex
actly what they are. Aneurysms occur
when a blistered blood vessel in the brain
pops and releases blood into the skull.
Terrible headaches ensue and almost 50
percent of victims die.
Currently there are two methods used
by physicians to defuse this time bomb.
The first is "clipping," or drilling through
the skull and putting a clip, usually made
of titanium, around the blister. As one can
imagine, this procedure is potentially
traumatic to the body. The other solution
is "coiling," which was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration in 1995.
Coiling consists of placing a catheter
through the brain and seeding the
aneurysm with platinum coils.
Studies have shown that coiling is as
effective as clipping, but doctors have
been skeptical of the procedure, be
cause data is based only on a few
months of testing. Many believe that
one can only be sure the procedure is
effective after following patients for as
long as 10 years.

Giant meteorites may have struck the
Earth multiple times, causing massive
extinctions. The most famous example is
the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million
years ago, credited to the impact of a
close-to-14-kilometer asteroid in the Yu
catan Peninsula.
Many researchers now credit the top
five extinctions in history — which deci
mated 90 percent of all living species —
to meteorite impacts. The Great Dying,
the largest of all extinctions that hap
pened 250 million years ago, may have
occurred when an asteroid struck what is
now northwestern Australia.
Researchers have used tracers such as
rock formation and soil analysis to deter
mine the location of a crater. Still, given
that our planet is 75 percent water, many
bodies may have hit the Earth, caused a
dramatic climate change, and left almost
no clue behind.
Child abuse may have more far
reaching impacts than previously
thought. Until recently, psychologists be
lieved that mistreatment during child
hood affected only social development
and self-image. Statistics showed that an
abused child was more likely to be anti-so
cial, violent and criminal.
However, new brain-imaging surveys
show that child abuse can damage neur
al structure and the functioning of the
developing brain itself. An abused
child's brain responds to the stress by
changing neuroreceptors and reducing
neural activities.
The finding undermines the effect of
therapy in attenuating past traumas. Al
most 3 million cases of child abuse and ne
glect are registered every year in the
United States.

mated 90 percent of all living species —
to meteorite impacts. The Great Dying,
the largest of all extinctions that hap
pened 250 million years ago, may have
occurred when an asteroid struck what is
now northwestern Australia.
Researchers have used tracers such as
rock formation and soil analysis to deter
mine the location of a crater. Still, given
that our planet is 75 percent water, many
bodies may have hit the Earth, caused a
dramatic climate change, and left almost
no clue behind.
Child abuse may have more far
reaching impacts than previously
thought. Until recently, psychologists be
lieved that mistreatment during child
hood affected only social development
and self-image. Statistics showed that an
abused child was more likely to be anti-so
cial, violent and criminal.
However, new brain-imaging surveys
show that child abuse can damage neur
al structure and the functioning of the
developing brain itself. An abused
child's brain responds to the stress by
changing neuroreceptors and reducing
neural activities.
The finding undermines the effect of
therapy in attenuating past traumas. Al
most 3 million cases of child abuse and ne
glect are registered every year in the
United States.




Full Moon on the ... Atlantic Ocean?
Horseshoe crabs in New Jersey seem to
have been following their own tradition
eons before Stanford students. Every
year, thousands of horseshoe crabs leave
the depths of the ocean to mate under the
light of a full moon. The reason for this is
that full moons cause higher tides, which
push the crabs onto the beach. When the
tides ebb, the crabs are washed back into
the sea.
The full moon is also a feast for laugh
ing gulls. The birds feed on newly laid
eggs, sometimes doubling their weight.
The New Jersey Division of Fish and
Wildlife calculated that some birds travel
as many as 11,000 miles and eat 300 tons
of eggs during their stay. All, the roman
ticism of a full moon.
Thought the bathroom down the hall
contained the worst smell you have ever
experienced? Try the Monell Chemical
Senses Center in Philadelphia next time.
Researchers there received a grant
from the Department of Defense three
years ago to develop a non-lethal "odor
bomb." The group focused on biological
sources because they thought these had
the best chances of universal recognition.
Tests have elected two winners —
human fecal waste and rotting food. The
first contains skatoles, white crystalline
compounds normally found in feces and
used as a fixative in perfumes. The latter
contains butyric acid, a viscous rancid liq
uid used in manufacturing plastic and
various sulfurous decay by-products.
Building an operating system fora
single computer is a real tour de force.
Building one for all the computers in the
world seems impossible. But that is ex
actly what some computer scientists have
in mind.
David P. Anderson and John Kunia
towicz of UC-Berkeley explained the
idea of an operating system spanning
the entire Internet in the March issue of
Scientific American. The Internet-scale
operating system could exploit the idle
computing time of 150 million machines
to perform work. The two principal ben
eficiaries would be data processing tasks
such as simulations and data analyses,

and online services such as databases
and file storage.
The real challenge, of course, is of
fering protection to individual users
and avoiding bugs that would crash the
system.

Most people have probably heard of
cerebral aneurysms but do not know ex
actly what they are. Aneurysms occur
when a blistered blood vessel in the brain
pops and releases blood into the skull.
Terrible headaches ensue and almost 50
percent of victims die.
Currently there are two methods used
by physicians to defuse this time bomb.
The first is "clipping," or drilling through
the skull and putting a clip, usually made
of titanium, around the blister. As one can
imagine, this procedure is potentially
traumatic to the body. The other solution
is "coiling," which was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration in 1995.
Coiling consists of placing a catheter
through the brain and seeding the
aneurysm with platinum coils.
Studies have shown that coiling is as
effective as clipping, but doctors have
been skeptical of the procedure, be
cause data is based only on a few
months of testing. Many believe that
one can only be sure the procedure is
effective after following patients for as
long as 10 years.

Giant meteorites may have struck the
Earth multiple times, causing massive
extinctions. The most famous example is
the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million
years ago, credited to the impact of a
close-to-14-kilometer asteroid in the Yu
catan Peninsula.
