# Senate hearing looks at federal stem-cell policy
## California legislature may enact more lenient restrictions 
### KHANH LAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A state panel of scientists and
health industry leaders gath
ered fora California Senate
hearing at the Faculty Club on
March 7 to discuss the scientific
and medical impacts of federal
stem-cell policy.
The hearing was convened by
State Sen. Deborah Ortiz (ID-
Sacramento), chair of the State
Senate's Health and Human Ser
vices Committee.
Among the panelists were
Cancer Biology Prof. Irving
Weissman, Law Prof. Henry
Creely, and Cancer Researcher
Paul Berg, a nobel laureate.
The hearing discussed the im
plications of federal legislation re
stricting or banning human em
bryonic stem-cell research. The
controversy revolves around the
cloning of human embryonic stem
cells, a process that some fear will
lead to the genetic replication of
human beings.
Human Biology Prof. William
Hurlbut, recently appointed to
President George W. Bush's
Council on Bioethics, said that the
panel "was a forceful and
poignant presentation of positive
scientific and medical perspec
tives on this issue."
Fhe panelists expressed con
cern over the potential passage of
the "Brownback Bill," recently de
bated by the U.S. I louse of Repre
sentatives, which would prohibit
all human somatic-cell nuclear
transplantation research.
"The specter of cloning has ob
scured the integral role of the
process in scientific and medical
research," Berg said. "The
Brownback proposal will impose a
criminal penalty on U.S. citizens
of $10 million and 10 years in
prison if they use therapies that
are developed for outside the
United States."
If the Brownback Bill passes the

U.S. Senate, it may override Cali
fornia's attempts to set its own
stem-cell policy.
Ortiz has submitted a bill that, if
passed, would impose fewer re
strictions on human embryonic
stem cell research in California
than those mandated by the White
House last summer.
"This legislation will affect
everybody," Ortiz said.
Panelists cited many negative
impacts of federal prohibitions
on stem cell research, including
difficulties in developing new
medical treatments, creating
economic impacts on California's
biotech industry and losing sci
entists from universities to other
countries due to a lack of fund
ing from the National Institutes
of Health.
"We're sending the best and
brightest minds away from the
country because of this," Ortiz
said. She cited the testimony of
former UC-San Francisco stem
cell pioneer Roger Pederson,
who fled to Britain soon after
Bush announced his decision to
freeze all federal funding for re
search of new embryonic stem
cell lines.
The existing 64 embryonic stem
cell lines that qualify for federal
funding aren't enough to further
medical research, said Pederson.
"These stem cell lines are all
impure," Pederson said. "Be
cause they have all been mixed
with mouse cultures, these cells
can't be used for transplantation
in humans."
The panel highlighted the
enormous potential for embryon
ic stem cell research in treating a
host of chronic, degenerative and
acute diseases, including diabetes,
Parkinson's disease, cancer,
Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord
injuries, multiple sclerosis, sickle
cell anemia and thalassemia.
The hearing concluded with
testimonies of potential beneficia
ries of embryonic stem cell re
search, including patients suffer
ing from spinal-cord injuries and
Parkinson's disease.
The U.S. Senate is expected to
consider passing the Brownback
proposal by March 22.
