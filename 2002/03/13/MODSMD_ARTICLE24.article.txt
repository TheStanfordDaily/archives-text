Social entrepreneurship pio
neer Bill Drayton shared insights
with students at a dinner and dis
cussion on March 7 at the Haas
Center for Public Service. Drayton
emphasized his belief in the entre
preneur as the most powerful
force of social change, and spoke
about ways for entrepreneurs to
bring about systemic change.
Drayton explained the mission
of Ashoka, a non-profit organiza
tion that he founded in 1980.
Ashoka supports a select group of
social entrepreneurs by providing
them with venture capital and
connecting them to a global net
work of like-minded innovators
who address social problems. It
takes its name from a Sanskrit
word meaning "the active absence
of sorrow."
The non-profit has selected
1,200 Ashoka Fellows from 42
countries since 1980, and now
distributes more than $7 million
each year.
Fellows typically receive a
three-year stipend so they can
focus full-time on implementing
their new ideas. They become
lifetime members of Ashoka's
Global Fellowship, which fosters

collaboration and provides valu
able contacts.
Fellows create and run a wide
variety of projects, such as a free
24-hour telephone helpline for
street children in India, an HIV
AIDS prevention program in
Nigeria, and workshops that help
thousands of low-income Ameri
can high school students make it
to college.
Drayton mentioned how his in
terest in history, especially the
ideas of Mahatina Gandhi, had in

spired founding Ashoka. He was
also influenced by his observation
of economic disparity in Asia, his
involvement in the civil rights
movement, and by other student
activist experiences at Phillips An
dover Academy and Harvard, ()x
-ford and Yale.
Drayton emphasized the im
portance for entrepreneurs of
"giving yourself permission to
break rules."
"Don't let the stuffed shirts
tell you what to do," he said to

the 16 students who joined him
for dinner.
Public Policy Prof. Gordon
Bloom called Drayton's social en
trepreneurship work "incredible."
"He is basically one of the cre
ators of the field," Bloom said.
"Twenty-two years after founding
Ashoka, there is an enormous
amount of collective wisdom."
In 1984, Drayton received a
Mac Arthur Fellowship, or "genius
grant," for his work as founder
and CEO of Ashoka. Saturday, the
National Wildlife Fund selected
the television and outreach pro
gram of an Ecuadorian Ashoka
Fellow of 2000 as the top interna
tional environmental education
project of the year.
Wednesday's dinner and dis
cussion was sponsored by the Fu
ture Social Innovators Network.
Vice President Marina Kim, a
freshman, organized the event as a
follow-up for Drayton's guest lec
ture in a class Bloom is teaching
this quarter.
The class is called "Public Poli
cy 191: Business Concepts and
Skills for the Social Sector."
To conclude his visit to Stan
ford, Drayton also spoke last Fri
day at the Global Philanthropy
Forum at the Graduate School
of Business.
