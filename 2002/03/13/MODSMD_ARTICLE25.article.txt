# BASES discussion focuses on bio-informatics

### KATHERINE BARR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
BASES Interact hosted a panel session last
Thursday in the Packard Engineering Building
titled, "Opportunities in Bio and Medical In
formatics." The event was an opportunity for
students and panelists to discuss the role of bio
informatics and opportunities for entrepre
neurs in the field.
Assoc. Medicine Prof. Mark Musen, the head
of Stanford Medical Informatics, said biomed
ical informatics has become a specific academic
field in the United States. It is viewed as "the ap
plication of information technology to prob
lems in biological sciences and medicine." In
contrast, it is not distinguished from computer
science in Europe.
Douglas Brutlag, the director of Stanford
Bioinformatics Resource and a professor of bio
chemistry and medicine, proposed, a narrow
definition of the field as the application of in

formatics to biological information, with an ex
ample being the study of drug binding.
When asked about the applications of bio-in
formatics by the panel's moderator, Bio Cent
ury Publications Senior Editor Gita Kumar, pan
elists came up with a variety of responses.
Silicon Genetics President and CEO Andrew
Conway said that one role of bio-informatics is
to understand biology better in order to mini
mize drug side effects.
Brutlag added that bio-informatics will have
a great impact in medicine by helping to un
derstand and diagnose inherited diseases by
studying the genome.
TTierapeutics and prognosis is a second area
where bio-informatics can contribute, accord
ing to panelists. For example, breast cancer mi
croarrays can help to tell whether a particular
patient will be better off with hormone treat
ment, chemotherapy or radiation. Another ex
ample is a database of HIV-sequencing used by
physicians to find out particular drugs that pa

tients are sensitive to, and which drugs will be
most effective.
Panelists also stressed the importance of
medical informatics for clinical trial information
management and for simulation experiments.
For example, bio-informatics can reduce the
number of human tests necessary to tell which
drugs will be toxic to the human body.
Brian Atwood, managing director and co
founder of Versant Ventures, said venture fund
ing in the area of informatics was popular about
five years ago. Due to the rapid uptake in tools for
genomics research, the market remains small.
"1 I his] area has been challenging for more
than five years now," Atwood said. 'The mar
ket size for these products is small. There are
only about 20 pharmaceutical companies who
might have an interest in enterprise-based in
formatics products."
The panel discussion concluded with an
overview of new areas for entrepreneurs to
explore.
