Hoover Distinguished Fellow
George P. Shultz, former United
States Secretary of State, spoke last
night at a dinner at the Faculty
Club.
The appearance by Shultz eon
eluded the first day of the Hoover
Institution National Security
Forum, a conference focused on
examining technologies for pre
venting terrorism.
Shultz delivered a speech about
the threat posed by terrorism and
potential solutions. After the ad
dress, Shultz answered questions
posed by dinner attendees.
"We must realize the serious
ness and continuing nature of the
threat," Shultz said.
He explained that terrorists are
reliant on the host governments
that harbor them.
"Terrorists cannot work in vac
uums," Shultz said. "They need
places to train and to plan."
Shultz commented specifically
on the military action of the Unit
ed States in Afghanistan against
the Taliban.
"Our actions are squarely with
in the framework of the [U.N.] Se
curity Council resolutions,"

Shultz said.
According to Shultz, most
countries have waited until terror
ist acts were committed before in
vestigating them. Shultz stressed
preventative action as a strategy to
fight terrorism in the future.
"When you can identify an at
tack in advance, you pre-empt and
take action," Shultz said. "War is
different from law enforcement."
Shultz also discussed the Mid
dle East conflict and the recent in
stances of violence that have flared
up in the region.
"People are alarmed, dismayed
and distraught, including me,"
Shultz said.
He said terrorists have derailed
peace negotiations between Is
raelis and Palestinians
In addition, he explained that
efforts must be made to eradicate
the terrorism compromising the
peace attempts.
"Fhe terrorists don't want
peace with Israel [and] they may
not even want peace without Is
rael," Shultz said. "The war
[against terrorism] must be fought
to victory."
Shultz referred to the cease-fire

agreements that the Israelis and
Palestinians have traditionally
pursued in the past, and said that
these are not enough to stop the
conflict permanently.
"The cease-fire is inadequate
and contributes to the cycle of vio
lence, for it is not a peace, but a
pause," Shultz said.
He talked about the possibility
of a true state-to-state series of ne
gotiations taking place between Is
raelis and Palestinians.
"There will need to be a Pales
tinian state with Israeli and Pales
tinian negotiations between these
two states," Shultz said.
Shultz then mentioned an ini
tiative that Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Abdullah is currently pur
suing. The so-called "Saudi Initia
tive" — if adopted by Arab League
states — would require Israel to

withdraw from the West Bank,
Gaza, East Jerusalem and the
Golan Heights. If Israel agreed,
then all nations in the Arab League
would respect Israel's sovereignty
and its borders.
"The potential is there for the
Arab world to recognize Israel's
presence," Shultz said. "We have
the potential fora real deal."
However, Shultz clarified that
territory turnovers by Israel should
not be carried out immediately.
"You can't just turn something
over," Shultz said. "There has to
be demilitarization, so it doesn't
just become a platform for attacks
again."
Overall, Shultz maintained that
there still is potential fora better
situation in the future of the Mid
dle East.
"It is a time for some new possi
bilities, because when things are at
their worst, they can be clarified,"
Shultz said. "There is always a
chance that something might
work. Just don't give up."
