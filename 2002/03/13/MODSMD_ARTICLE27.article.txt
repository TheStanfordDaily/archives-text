# Stanford attends mock U.N.
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid changing times and an array of
prominent world events, a group of Stanford
students took part in what is sometimes char
acterized as an experience unlike any other. A
delegation consisting of students from the So
ciety for International Affairs recently repre
sented Stanford at a Model United Nations
conference at UC- Berkeley from Feb. 28 to
March 3.
The event attracted more than 500 individ
uals from universities across the nation. The
Berkeley conference was one of several con
ferences taking part across the country at dif
ferent times during the year.
The Stanford team won third place in the
small delegation category.
"[Our] success is particularly noteworthy
since Stanford has not had a traveling team for
a number of years," junior Anya Vodopyanov,
a member of the executive committee and re
cipient of the Best Delegate award, said.
Each member of the delegation represent
ed a country of personal interest. T he mem
bers and their respective countries were
Vodopyanov (East Germany), Mike Brooks
(The Netherlands), Nathalie de Leon (The
Netherlands), K.T. Khoo (Mongolia), Tai Ni
colopoulos (Guatemala), Dinyar Patel (Mona

co), Jesse Torrence (Guatemala), Mike
Solomon (Hungary), Silvana Rodriguez (The
Netherlands) and Ariel Jacobovits (Turk
menistan).
The conference consisted of a number of
committee meetings on topics that corre
sponded to current affairs and the individual
interests of the student chairs who participat
ed. The largest committee, the general assem
bly, was "modeled directly after the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly," Vodopyanov said.
The participants reflected on their involve
ment with the Model United Nations and
their four-day experience.
"Doing Model U.N. grounds me," sopho
more de Leon, winner of the Outstanding Del
egate award, said. "[Model U.N.] keeps me
well-rounded."
"I got really excited when we revived the
Model U.N. club at Stanford," sophomore
Patel said. "I wanted to try something new."
"I've always been interested in internation
al affairs," sophomore Brooks said. "[Model
U.N.j gives you good experience in negotiat
ing even if you are not going into internation
al affairs."
"I was pretty excited in the opportunity,"
sophomore K.T. Kho said. "[I have] devel
oped an interest in international affairs."
The delegates resolved issues in a manner
consistent with how representatives in the real

United Nations handled similar problems. As
such, participants gained practical experience
in formulating solutions to prominent global
issues.
"On a completely grandiose scheme you
are training future diplomats," de Leon said.
" 1 followed current events through [my] in
terest in journalism," freshman Nicolopoulos
said. "I spent some time doing work with or
phans in Latin America . . . this is why I was
assigned Guatemala."
Attending the conference is one of a few
major accomplishments for the Society of In
ternational Affairs since it became an official
university organization at the beginning of
the school year. In the fall the society will
host a Model U.N. conference for high
school students.
