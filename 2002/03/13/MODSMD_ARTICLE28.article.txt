### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Now that David Letterman
is staying at CBS, ABC's corporate bosses took
steps to mend fences with "Nightline" host Ted
Koppel yesterday.
Walt Disney Co. chief executive Michael Eisner
phoned Koppel and the two had a "warm, friendly"
conversation, according to an ABC employee who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
On Monday Koppel said ABC's efforts to install
Letterman in the time slot held by "Nightline" for 22
years had caused "collateral damage" to the show.
And although ABC executives said "Nightline" will
stay put, Koppel said he wanted more than "bland as
surances or short-term guarantees" about its future.
He wanted a clear signal to everyone that Disney was
behind his show.
The future of "Nightline" is being closely watched
among journalists for signals about how news is val
ued in an era when the major networks are small
parts of conglomerates — ABC in Disney, CBS in Vi
acom and NBC in General Electric.
"If you can take a genuine broadcast news institu
tion that is regarded very, very highly and is prof
itable and treat it this way, then I think it reflects a
value system that bodes very bad things to come for
broadcast news," said Alex Jones, director of the
Shorenstein Center for Press, Politics and Public Pol
icy at Harvard University.
