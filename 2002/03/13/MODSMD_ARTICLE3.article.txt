# Yost to change to language theme house
## 
### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The human biology focus house will vacate Yost
after this school year to make way fora near-total-im
mersion Spanish and Portuguese language theme.
The Human Biology Program will be changed
from a focus house to a theme house and moved to the
Row — replacing either Storey, 553 Mayfield or
Grove Lausen — fora one-year trial period.
According to Director of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo, the Subcommittee on Residential Ed
ucation approved the proposal from the Spanish and
Portuguese department fora Spanish Language
house in Spring 2001.
"This was the first house approved under the new
guidelines for language and culture houses first
passed in 2000," Camarillo said. "Based on the pro
posal that was submitted, which requests space fora
live-in faculty or lecturer, access to guest-room space
and availability of a seminar room, the Yost location
was chosen and the full proposal with the house as
signment was approved by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies."
"Our faculty [is] uniformly excited about this pro
ject," Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Yvonne Yarbro-
Bejarano said in her proposal to the Office of Resi
dential Education. "It is something we have wanted to
do for many years but lacked the faculty strength to
sustain it."
Spanish, according to Yarbro-Bejarano's proposal,
is the most studied language at Stanford, drawing
about 650 undergraduates each quarter. Approxi
mately 50 percent of the student body uses Spanish to

complete the one-year language requirement.
In a spring 2000 survey, 50 percent of freshmen
and sophomores in first- and second-year language
courses said they would be interested in living in a
Spanish language and culture theme house.
"When we did the original survey of the Spanish
language students, they were wildly enthusiastic
about the possibility," said Elizabeth Bernhardt, di
rector of the Language Center and a German Stud
ies professor.

ish and Portuguese house would overlap or conflict

Next year, Yost will abandon its Human Biology focus to
make way fora near-total immersion Spanish-Por

will be changed to a theme house and movea to the Row

with Casa Zapata, but she said Casa
Zapata involves Chicano and
Latin-American culture while the
Spanish-Portuguese house would
focus on the language.
"The two are quite
distinct. . . and should comple
ment each other well," Yarbro-Be
jarano said.
The most noticeable difference
will involve a pledge requiring
Spanish and Portuguese house res
idents to speak Spanish in the
house in a near-total-immersion
policy. The house would provide
"an environment in which Stan
ford students can use Spanish ac
tively for most of their daily life rou
tines," Bernhardt said.
Other colleges such as Dart
mouth have similar programs and
Bernhardt noted there was some
sentiment in Casa Italiana and La
Maison Francais to require a lan
guage pledge.

A student would be required to
have fulfilled the first-year Spanish
language requirement to obtain
"priority one" status, Bernhardt
said, and she did not think there
would be a problem with having
first-year students living with more
highly proficient students.
"It is designed to be an interac
tive process between upper-level
and lower-level [students]," Bern
hardt said.
The Subcommittee on Residen
tial Education and Advising —
which Bernhardt chairs — ap
proved the Spanish and Por
tuguese house late last year, Bern
hardt said. Applicants were not
asked to provide a specific location
for the theme house.
According to Camarillo, Yost
was chosen because it provides
access to seminar rooms and is
close to guest houses for visiting
scholars.
Camarillo also noted the gener
al lack of interest for the human bi
ology focus at Yost as another rea
son Res Ed replaced it with the
Spanish theme house.

"In the past five years the
Human Biology focus house has
suffered from smaller numbers of
priority residents," Camarillo said.
"It was clear, given the strength of
the residential program, that the
location contributed to the low in
terest in the Draw."
Bernhardt said that the Spanish
and Portuguese house would not
suffer from the same lack of inter
est, and its forcing of the Human
Biology Program into a formerly
non-priority house would not be
detrimental to campus life.
"I could understand that con
cern if it were any language ex
cept Spanish," Bernhardt said,
citing the large number of Span
ish-studying students on campus
who would qualify for the new
house. "That's not a worry.
We're just really excited to have
this opportunity."
Yost Resident Assistant Mike
Johnson, ajunior, discussed poten
tial campus reaction to losing any
of the three well-drawing, non-pri
ority Row houses to a human biol
ogy theme house.

"Some students are definitely
going to bitch, but ... at least it isn't
gonna be the [computer science] or
[electrical engineering] theme
house," Johnson said.
"Since human biology has an
incredibly healthy number of ma
jors," Camarillo said, "we feel
that this location change will
serve to attract more of these ma
jors to draw priority into the
house, as well as provide non-ma
jors or undeclared sophomores a
location to learn more about the
area of study."
Camarillo said that Human Bi
ology' Program Director Russell
Fernald and Biology Prof. Craig
Heller have agreed to serve as
house faculty affiliates.
Current Yost Focus Assistant
Anna West, a senior, noted that fac
ulty involvement would be vital to
the viability of the new human biol
ogy theme house.
"The future strength of the hum
bio theme house will depend on
the success of current efforts to re
cruit dedicated faculty sponsors
and theme assistants," West said.
