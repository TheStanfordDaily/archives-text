# Yost to change to language theme house

### JOHN HUETTER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The human biology focus house will vacate Yost
after this school year to make way fora near-total-im
mersion Spanish and Portuguese language theme.
The Human Biology Program will be changed
from a focus house to a theme house and moved to the
Row — replacing either Storey, 553 Mayfield or
Grove Lausen — fora one-year trial period.
According to Director of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo, the Subcommittee on Residential Ed
ucation approved the proposal from the Spanish and
Portuguese department fora Spanish Language
house in Spring 2001.
"This was the first house approved under the new
guidelines for language and culture houses first
passed in 2000," Camarillo said. "Based on the pro
posal that was submitted, which requests space fora
live-in faculty or lecturer, access to guest-room space
and availability of a seminar room, the Yost location
was chosen and the full proposal with the house as
signment was approved by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies."
"Our faculty [is] uniformly excited about this pro
ject," Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Yvonne Yarbro-
Bejarano said in her proposal to the Office of Resi
dential Education. "It is something we have wanted to
do for many years but lacked the faculty strength to
sustain it."
Spanish, according to Yarbro-Bejarano's proposal,
is the most studied language at Stanford, drawing
about 650 undergraduates each quarter. Approxi
mately 50 percent of the student body uses Spanish to

complete the one-year language requirement.
In a spring 2000 survey, 50 percent of freshmen
and sophomores in first- and second-year language
courses said they would be interested in living in a
Spanish language and culture theme house.
"When we did the original survey of the Spanish
language students, they were wildly enthusiastic
about the possibility," said Elizabeth Bernhardt, di
rector of the Language Center and a German Stud
ies professor.
Yarbro-Bejarano noted some might think a Span
ish and Portuguese house would overlap or conflict
