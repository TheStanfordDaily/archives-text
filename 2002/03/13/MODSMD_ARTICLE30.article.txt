### ERIN ARCHERD STAFF WRITER 
In its Feb. 24 issue, USA Today rec
ognized two Stanford seniors — human
biology majors Donald Matsuda and
Cindy Lin — for their academic and
community-service achievements. Mat
suda was chosen for the AJI-USA college
academic first team, while Lin received
an honorable mention.
The awards focused on students
who coupled outstanding academic
performance with a commitment to
improving society. All 20 members of
the first team received trophies and
$2,500 awards.
Out of close to 600 nominations, 40
more students were chosen for the sec

ond and third teams, and 44 received
honorable mention.
Matsuda noted the quality of the stu
dents chosen for the award.
"It is an honor to be in the company
of so many outstanding undergraduates
who are truly committed to 'making a
difference' in the world," Matsuda said.
"It is wonderful to hear about other un
dergraduates across the nation who are
so dedicated to their causes, both at
home and abroad."
Lin expressed similar sentiments in
response to her selection.
"I'm definitely surprised and hon
ored to receive this award," Lin said. "I
can think of at least a dozen other quali
fied seniors. There are so many amazing
people here at Stanford and across the
country."
Both Matsuda and Lin are involved
in issues related to public health policy.
Matsuda has focused on providing
broader community health insurance.
He organized a series of Healthy Fami

lies insurance drives to provide low-cost
health insurance to children of immi
grant families in Sacramento.
He also founded two Children's
Health Insurance Program initiatives in
the Stanford area and trained 30 stu
dents to serve as Healthy Families appli
cation assistants.
Matsuda has served as director of the
Stanford Medical Youth Science Pro
gram, co-founder and executive editor
in-chief of the Stanford Undergraduate
Research Journal, undergraduate di
rector of the Asian Health Access Pro
ject, director of Camp ReCreation, edi
tor of the Stanford QUAD and director
of the Volunteers in Health program.
Susie Brubaker-Cole, director of un
dergraduate research programs, said
she admired Matsuda's approach to
solving problems.
"He accomplished so much . . . by
creating new channels for change,"
