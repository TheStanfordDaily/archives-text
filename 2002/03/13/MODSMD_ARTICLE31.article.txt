# Kappa Sig hosts beer-free party
## 
### JENNIFER KONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite the lack of intoxicating beverages,
Kappa Sigma was still very much alive at its
second annual foam party March 9.
"We may be on alcohol probation, but
we're not on fun probation," the fraternity
proclaimed in an e-mail promoting what it
called "Foam Party 2K2."
According to senior Greg Ruth, the
Kappa Sig social chair, the fraternity was
placed on alcohol probation for the fall and
winter quarters of this school year, "as a re
sult of conduct issues last spring."
After reviewing recommendations of the
Greek Judicial Board, Dean of Students
Marc VVais decided to impose the probation
along with other sanctions. The probation
restricts the fraternity from serving alcohol
at any social activities.
"We think the probation is a bit extreme
at this point," said senior Jamie Potter, a
Kappa Sig member. "But we're dealing with
it, and the house is doing well right now."
Due to the probation, Kappa Sig was not
able to hold two of its biggest parties, "Mud
wrestling Night" and "Bikini Night," Ruth
said. However, he said that the fraternity is
determined to maintain its strong social
presence on campus.
"We decided to have a party last week be
cause we felt that we could still offer this
campus social opportunities despite the sig
nificant constraints placed on us by the Uni
versity," Ruth said.
Senior Craig Baumgartner, the head so
cial chair of Kappa Sig, estimates that about

500 to 600 people attended the party. These
figures remained strong throughout the
night even though the foam machine wasn't
working as well as expected.
In addition to not being able to serve al
cohol, Kappa Sig cannot allow attendees to
bring their own alcoholic beverages. This
was a great concern among Kappa Sig mem
bers, who heightened security for the event
and kept on the lookout throughout the
night.
According to Baumgartner, no prob
lems arose.
"We were pretty impressed with the fact
that we didn't have any problems with peo
ple bringing alcohol," Baumgartner said.
However, many people arrived at the
party intoxicated.
"The incidence of 'wastedness' was prob
ably actually higher at our non-alcoholic
party than at our typical party at which we
serve alcohol," Ruth said.
Both Baumgartner and Ruth agreed
that — while dry parties are fun — they are
not quite up to par with wet parties.
"Throwing a party like this without alco
hol was a very unique experience," Baum
gartner said. "It's one that I hope we never
have to do again. It was fun, but it wasn't
complete."
Kappa Sig must wait until the end of the
rush period in spring quarter for their pro
bationary status to end. Despite the wait,
Kappa Sig members keep a positive outlook.
"Maybe it seems strange fora fraternity
to throw a party without alcohol," Baum
gartner said, "but at least we're not stealing
goats."
