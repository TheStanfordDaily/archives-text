## Yoga attracts students 
### JENNY MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The übiquitous rolled-up purple and
green mats give the secret away. The guy
from Lantana, the girl in section, the
stressed-out freshman whizzing past on
her bike — all of them take yoga.
Stanford offers seven beginning yoga
classes and turns 20 to 30 people away
from each class every quarter, according
to head yoga teacher Nanci Conniff. In
addition, intermediate yoga and yoga
for golf are also offered.
Yoga classes have risen in popularity
since their introduction eight years ago,
and are now so sought-after that a lottery
is necessary to determine which 25 stu
dents are the lucky ones to be accepted
to each class.
The Athletics Department would like
to add more classes, but the yoga room
"is full all day," Conniff said. "It breaks
our hearts."
A class will soon be added on a recre
ational basis at the only time the room is
free — 6:30 a.m.
"We won't have to turn anyone away
from that class," Conniff said, laughing.
The nine classes are taught by five dif

ferent female teachers, each with her
own style of teaching.
five main types of yoga are being
taught right now in the U.S., according
to teacher Zora Neuhold Huber.
Among these are Iyengar, the most com
mon form, which is recommended for
beginners; Bikram, which is performed
in a very hot room; and Vinyasa, which
Huber describes as "flowing yoga."
Huber advises trying different styles
of yoga until finding one that really fits.
"If it didn't click for you when you
tried a yoga class, try it again," Huber
said.

Regardless of the style or teacher,
yoga classes demand that students
"leave [theirj baggage at the door,
Conniff said.
According to the instructors, Yoga's
benefits are numerous, including in
creased flexibility and strength, mental
clarity and a boost in energy.
Stanford students flock to yoga
classes for these reasons and more, but
most share a desire to take a break
from the stress of classes and other
obligations.
"[Yoga] has a real beneficial effect for
students," said senior Katie Rose Hille
gass. "We spend so much time hunched
over our desks in these horrible pos
tures. I think yoga does some things that
really reverse these harmful effects."
Depending on the style of yoga and
the yoga teacher, different classes in
corporate more or less of the spiritual
aspects that are traditionally part of
yoga.
"A lot of students don't want this
stuff," ConnifF said, referring to yoga's
non-physical aspects. "But just by doing
the physical practice and being in the
environment you can absorb some of
that peacefulness."
