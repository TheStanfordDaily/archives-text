HOUSTON (AP) â€” Andrea
Yates, the 37-year-old housewife
who admitted she drowned her
live children, was convicted of
murder yesterday by a jury that
rejected her claim of insanity in
just 3 1/2 hours.
Yates, who could be sen
tenced to death or to life in
prison, showed little reaction as
she stood between her attorneys
during the verdict. In the audi
ence, her husband, Russell, mut
tered "oh God" and clasped his
head with both hands.
Yates was convicted of two
charges of capital murder. The
charges cover the deaths of three
of her children.
Deliberations began at mid
day after prosecutors told the
jury of eight women and four

men that even though Yates is
mentally ill, she knew drowning
her children was wrong and is
thus guilty of murder.
"That's the key," prosecutor
Kaylynn Williford said. "Andrea
Yates knew right from wrong,
and she made a choice on June
20 to kill her children deliber
ately and with deception."
The defense argued that she
suffered from postpartum de
pression so severe that she had
lost her ability for rational
thought.
" We can't permit objective logic
to be imposed on the actions of
Andrea Yates," defense attorney
George Parnham said. "She was so
psychotic on June 20 that she ab
solutely believed what she was
doing was the right thing to do."

Parnham also told the jury in
the closely watched case: "This is
an opportunity for this jury to
make a determination about the
status of women's mental health.
Make no mistake, the world is
watching."
Alter deliberating about 2 1/4
hours, jurors passed a note to
District Judge Belinda Hill ask
ing for the definition of insanity.
Thirty minutes later, jurors
asked fora cassette player.
Among items in evidence are au
diotapes of Yates' confession and
her 911 call to police the day of
the drownings.
Last year, Yates called her five
children into the bathroom one
by one and drowned them in the
tub, then called 911 to tell au
thorities what she had done.
