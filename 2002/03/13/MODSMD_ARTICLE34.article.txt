# Zimbabwe's election considered flawed by many
## 
### 
HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) —
Independent observers and
human rights groups on yesterday
condemned Zimbabwe's presiden
tial election as deeply flawed and
demanded the release of more
than 1,000 polling agents and ob
servers they charge were arrested
during the balloting.
The criticism came as initial re
turns yesterday night gave Presi
dent Robert Mugabe a 52 percent
to 46 percent lead over Morgan
Tsvangirai, with about 18 percent
of districts reporting.
The three days of voting in a bit
terly contested election were con
sidered a crucial test for democra
cy in this southern African nation.
Mugabe — the only leader Zim
babwe has known in 22 years of in
dependence — faced his first real
challenge in Tsvangirai, a former
labor organizer.
But independent observers
questioned the validity of the vote,

saying it was tainted by violence,
intimidation, confusion and the
disenfranchisement of thousands
of voters in the opposition strong
hold of Harare.
"The presidential elections
failed to meet key, broadly accept
ed criteria for elections," said Kare
Vollan, head of the 25-member
Norwegian Observer mission.
He said the mission, the largest
European delegation, found flaws
with every step of the electoral
process from voter registration and
campaigning to the actual vote.
Several groups said more than
1,000 people had been arrested in
connection with the election.
Amnesty International said
1,400 opposition polling agents
and independent election ob
servers had been detained but
added other people had been ar
rested for allegedly trying to vote a
second time.
"We are deeply concerned for

the safety of those arrested in the
light of the well-established pat
tern of'disappearances,' cruel, in
human and degrading treatment
by Zimbabwean security forces,"
Amnesty said in a statement de
manding their release.
Toni Reeler, an official with the
Zimbabwean human rights group
Amani Trust, said late yesterday
that at least 2,000 people had been
detained, the majority of which
had not been released.
Police said Monday 277 people
had been arrested in Harare for
voting irregularities. Police
spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena
said yesterday he had no updated
information.
Foreign election observers com
plained to police that 75 people
were being held in a chicken wire
cage in the Harare township of
Glen View, and about 40 others
spent the night in police cells and a
cage in the northwestern suburb of

Mabelreign.
Roy Cook, a human rights work
er, said most of those from the com
paratively affluent suburb were ac
cused of trying to vote twice and
were denied blankets, food and
water. A former national rugby cap
tain was among those arrested.
Mugabe led the nation to inde
pendence in 1980 and laced little
dissent until recent years, when
the nation's economy collapsed
and political violence — blamed
mostly on the ruling party — be
came rampant.
The economy began unravel
ling after the occupations of white
owned farms began in March
2000. Unemployment is at 60 per
cent, inflation 112 percent and the
"breadbasket of southern Africa"
has to import food.
Mugabe justified the farm
seizures as a justified response to
the legacy of inequitable land own
ership left by British colonial rule.
