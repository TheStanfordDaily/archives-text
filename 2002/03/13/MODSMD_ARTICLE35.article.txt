## Men start title quest in St. Louis 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
ST. LOUIS â€” You could argue that
this city is where this whole thing started.
It's where Stanford earned its Final
Four berth in 1998, when it came back to
beat Rhode Island, securing its first bid to
the national semifinals since 1942.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Thursday: No. 8 Stanford vs. No. 9
Western Kentucky, 7:30 p.m., first
round of NCAA Tournament, St. Louis

Nobody can forget the way Mark Mad
sen flailed his arms and screamed at the
top of his lungs that night, pronouncing
the Cardinal as a legitimate collegiate bas
ketball powerhouse.
It was an instant frozen in time. A mag
ical one too.
It's safe to say that this week, Stanford
needs a whole lot more of that Gateway
City magic.
As a No. 8 seed, its lowest since 1996,
the Cardinal will face a highly motivated
Western Kentucky team tomorrow night
at7:3op.m. in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament at the Edward Jones Dome.
If Stanford gets past the Hilltoppers, a
task in itself, it will then most likely face
top-seeded Kansas on Saturday.
But right now, a game against the Jay
hawks seems like ages away.
Frankly, Western Kentucky is on a
mission. Ranked No. 19 in the most re
cent AP poll, the Hilltoppers (28-3) have
won their last 18 games and have not lost
since December. They upset Kentucky in
Lexington at the beginning of the season
and are looking for respect.
The reason?
"I don't know much about them,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said
on Sunday.
And neither does the rest of America.
Fora team that won the Sun Belt Confer
ence Tournament and regular-season
title, there is no question that the Hilltop
pers will be looking to draw national at
tention to all mid-major conferences.

Furthermore, many people feel that
Western Kentucky was shafted by the
NCAA Tournament seeding committee,
much like Gonzaga, and given a worse
seed than it deserved.
Stanford, on the other hand, a team
that is still reeling from a 25-point loss to
Southern California in its last game, has,
at times, not shown the drive to win the
way its crusaders did four years ago.
"We had some tough kids on that
team," Montgomery said, referring to his

Final Four team in 1998. "This year,
we've had a little bit of a mindset that we
don't have to scrap like other teams to win
because [in the recent past] we've been
good. We need to get back to rolling up
our sleeves. We need to use a blue-collar
approach to playing basketball."
By all accounts, the Hilltoppers are
10 men deep and are excellent perime
ter shooters. Inside the key, they are led

Sophomore forward Teyo Johnson and the No. 8 seeded Cardinal will face ninth-seeded
Western Kentucky in an NCAA Tournament first-round game tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford has not lost in the first round in 10 years.
by a 7-foot-1, 280-pound center
in senior Chris Marcus, who is
sure to give Stanford junior cen
ter Curtis Borchardt fits.
"Typically, guys like that aren't
comfortable coming out on the
perimeter," Borchardt said. "I have
to work on ways to get separation
between him and me. I won't be
going straight at him because that's
probably where he's at his best."
Marcus, who averages 16.4
points and 9.4 rebounds per game,
missed two months of the season
due to an ankle injury, yet the Hill
toppers still managed to win.
Other key players for Western
Kentucky include junior forward

David Boyden (11.4 ppg, 6.1
rpg), senior guard Derek Robin
son (10.6 ppg) and freshman
guard Patrick Sparks (10.4 ppg).
If Stanford lost to the Hilltop
pers, it would be the first time the
Cardinal fell this early in the
NCAA Tournament since 1992
when it was a 12 seed and
dropped a game to No. 5 seed Al
abama, 80-75.
And then there's the all-too-ob
vious reason the Cardinal shouldn't
do well in this tournament.
Stanford has not won more
than four games in a row at any
time this season, and three of its
victories during its four-game win
ning streak were against Pac-10
bottom dwellers Washington,
Washington State and Oregon
State. To say that it will win six in a
row against the nation's toughest

teams might be a stretch.
But according to senior point
guard Tony Ciovacchini, if the
Cardinal starts well, a good half
can turn into a solid game, and one
solid game can turn into two, three
or four victories.
"It's all about what happens
during those 40 minutes on the
court," Ciovacchini said.
Whether tomorrow's 40 min
utes will be the Cardinal's last is yet
to be determined. What is certain,
though, is the difference between
recent teams and this one.
"The margin of error that we've
had in the past doesn't exist now,"
Montgomery said. "Guys have to
perform, guys have to play better.
Anything other than that will
knock us out of the tournament."
Whether there is St. Louis
magic or not.
