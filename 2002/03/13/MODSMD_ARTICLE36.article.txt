## 
### KENNETH GARRETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The undefeated Cardinal men's swim
team went to Los Angeles with a singular
purpose: to bring home its 21st consecu
tive Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship trophy.
Not even the bright Southern California
sun or the beckoning Pacific just a stone's
throw away could distract the top-ranked
Cardinal, as it won 7 ofl 3 individual events
and 3 of 5 relays, crushing the next runner
up, California, 918-708.5.
With Stanford so dominant, it's easy lor
fans to forget that the Pac-10 is the strongest
swimming conference in the country. The
swimmers knew it, though, and were ready.
"We went into die meet respecting the
other teams, but not fearing them," said ju
nior tri-captain John Waters.
If the competition didn't reciprocate
that respect and feel some fear last week,
they certainly ought to now.
Stanford started strong on Thursday
with a win in the 200 yard freestyle relay
and a strong showing from sophomore
Matt Sorlien in the 500 freestyle. His
time of 4:18.82 was five seconds oil his
previous 2002 best, and is the sixth

fastest in Cardinal history.
llie most spectacular show of the night
came from freshman Dan Trupin. He sur
prised himself as much as his competition
when he broke the Pac-10 and Stanford

records with a 1:43.83 in the 200 individual
medley. Trupin's time placed him first in
the nation by two seconds, and was the

third fastest 200 individual medley
ever.
"We all knew he was incredibly
capable, but that performance just
exceeded all our expectations," said
sophomore Michael Bruce.
With the crowd still buzzing
from Thursday's victories,
sophomore Markus Rogan
clinched another Pac-10 title on
Friday in the 400 IM, with a time
of 3:42.76. Rogan and Olympic
medalist Erik Vendt from South
ern California were tied going
into the last 100 yards, but Rogan
was not intimidated.
"Usually Vendt comes back on
people in the last 100, but Markus
completely smoked him," said
teammate Peter Marshall.
Sophomore Michael Bruce also
dominated the competition with a
blistering 53.79 in the 100 breast
stroke. This was his first Pac-10 title.
Saturday then saw him sweeping the
deck with the competitors in the 200
breaststroke, as he won that event.

Stanford's unbelievable back
strokers then stole the show, with
Randall Bal winning his third con
secutive Pac-10 tide in the 100 back
stroke (46.35). Peter Marshall t(x>k a
close second, while Jayme Cramer
and Dan Westcott took 4th and sth.
All four achieved automatic NCAA
qualifying times.
Rogan, Marshall and Bal then
swept the 200 backstroke on Satur
day going 1-2-3 in a stunning
crowd-pleaser. The Cardinal's
sweep was the first time that a single
school had three men swim under
1:43.00 in the same race.
Though the team championship
had long been in the bag, the Cardi
nal still thirsted for more individual
and relay titles. Westcott rocketed to
his first individual title in the 200
butterfly on Saturday with a time of
1:44.21. The team of Bal, Marshall,
Jeff Guyman and Andrew Schnell
then finished the night strong with a
second-place finish, the second
fastest time in the nation in the 400
freestyle relay (2:51.85).
"We [the team] were just
swimming too well to be beat,"
said Bruce.
The Cardinal was heir to the

longest winning streak in any colle
giate sport this weekend and was ex
tremely proud to have kept the tra
dition alive fora 21st year.
"It's hard to imagine I wasn't
even alive when Stanford started
this winning streak," Trupin said.
This win, however, was about
more than just the tradition.
It places the Cardinal in an envi
able position entering the NCAA
championship from March 28 to
March 30 in Athens, Ga. Sixteen
Cardinal swimmers have now qual
ified to compete and all of them are
likely to score points. Having so
soundly defeated some of the best
teams in the country also gives the
Cardinal great confidence that it can
defeat perennial powerhouses
Texas and Auburn.
"If we just swim the way we're ca
pable of swimming, we're going to
win NCAAs, and that's a great psy
chological advantage," Bruce said.
Marshall also sees the team's past
performance as an indicator of
great things to come.
"We've just been steamrolling
everybody this year. We did it
again at Pac-lOs, and we can do it
again at NCAAs."

With Stanford so dominant, it's easy lor
fans to forget that the Pac-10 is the strongest
swimming conference in the country. The
swimmers knew it, though, and were ready.
"We went into die meet respecting the
other teams, but not fearing them," said ju

If the competition didn't reciprocate
that respect and feel some fear last week,
they certainly ought to now.
Stanford started strong on Thursday
with a win in the 200 yard freestyle relay
and a strong showing from sophomore
Matt Sorlien in the 500 freestyle. His
time of 4:18.82 was five seconds oil his
previous 2002 best, and is the sixth

fastest in Cardinal history.
llie most spectacular show of the night
came from freshman Dan Trupin. He sur
prised himself as much as his competition
when he broke the Pac-10 and Stanford

records with a 1:43.83 in the 200 individual
medley. Trupin's time placed him first in
the nation by two seconds, and was the

third fastest 200 individual medley
ever.
"We all knew he was incredibly
capable, but that performance just
exceeded all our expectations," said
sophomore Michael Bruce.
With the crowd still buzzing
from Thursday's victories,
sophomore Markus Rogan
clinched another Pac-10 title on
Friday in the 400 IM, with a time
of 3:42.76. Rogan and Olympic
medalist Erik Vendt from South
ern California were tied going
into the last 100 yards, but Rogan
was not intimidated.
"Usually Vendt comes back on
people in the last 100, but Markus
completely smoked him," said
teammate Peter Marshall.
Sophomore Michael Bruce also
dominated the competition with a
blistering 53.79 in the 100 breast
stroke. This was his first Pac-10 title.
Saturday then saw him sweeping the
deck with the competitors in the 200
breaststroke, as he won that event.

Stanford's unbelievable back
strokers then stole the show, with
Randall Bal winning his third con
secutive Pac-10 tide in the 100 back
stroke (46.35). Peter Marshall t(x>k a
close second, while Jayme Cramer
and Dan Westcott took 4th and sth.
All four achieved automatic NCAA
qualifying times.
Rogan, Marshall and Bal then
swept the 200 backstroke on Satur
day going 1-2-3 in a stunning
crowd-pleaser. The Cardinal's
sweep was the first time that a single
school had three men swim under
1:43.00 in the same race.
Though the team championship
had long been in the bag, the Cardi
nal still thirsted for more individual
and relay titles. Westcott rocketed to
his first individual title in the 200
butterfly on Saturday with a time of
1:44.21. The team of Bal, Marshall,
Jeff Guyman and Andrew Schnell
then finished the night strong with a
second-place finish, the second
fastest time in the nation in the 400
freestyle relay (2:51.85).
"We [the team] were just
swimming too well to be beat,"
said Bruce.
The Cardinal was heir to the

longest winning streak in any colle
giate sport this weekend and was ex
tremely proud to have kept the tra
dition alive fora 21st year.
"It's hard to imagine I wasn't
even alive when Stanford started
this winning streak," Trupin said.
This win, however, was about
more than just the tradition.
It places the Cardinal in an envi
able position entering the NCAA
championship from March 28 to
March 30 in Athens, Ga. Sixteen
Cardinal swimmers have now qual
ified to compete and all of them are
likely to score points. Having so
soundly defeated some of the best
teams in the country also gives the
Cardinal great confidence that it can
defeat perennial powerhouses
Texas and Auburn.
"If we just swim the way we're ca
pable of swimming, we're going to
win NCAAs, and that's a great psy
chological advantage," Bruce said.
Marshall also sees the team's past
performance as an indicator of
great things to come.
"We've just been steamrolling
everybody this year. We did it
again at Pac-lOs, and we can do it
again at NCAAs."
The undefeated Cardinal men's swim
team went to Los Angeles with a singular
purpose: to bring home its 21st consecu
tive Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship trophy.
Not even the bright Southern California
sun or the beckoning Pacific just a stone's
throw away could distract the top-ranked
Cardinal, as it won 7 ofl 3 individual events
