# No. 2 women to host two tourney games
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
March has officially arrived.
The Cardinal women's basketball team
is back in the thick of things this year,
though not sitting quite as high as planned.
Stanford (30-2) found itself accepting
an invitation to the Big Dance as a No. 2
seed in the West following its surprising
loss to Arizona State in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Tournament finals last week.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Friday: No. 2 Stanford vs. No. 15
Weber State, 9 p.m., first round of
NCAA Tournament, Maples Pavilion

Despite a 22-game win streak that
stretched back to December, the commit
tee based its decision on Stanford's most
recent performance.
While not exactly what the Cardinal
wanted to see, the seeding was good enough
to prolong the team's season at home, as
Stanford will host the first and second
rounds at Maples Pavilion this weekend.
Stanford opens the tournament against
Weber State (22-8), which will make its first
ever NCAA tournament appearance. Hail
ing from Ogden, Utah, the team earned its
way into the tournament by winning the
Big Sky Conference tournament.
To move on to the regionals, Stanford
will have to defeat both Weber State and the
winner of the No. 7 Colorado State (24-6) /

No. lOTulane (23-10) first-round matchup.
Oklahoma (27-3), winner of the Big 12
Tournament, snagged the No. 1 seed in the
West and could meet the Cardinal in the re
gional final to determine who moves on to
the Final Four, which will be played in San
Antonio from March 29 to March 31.
Vanderbilt won the Southeastern Con
ference tourney and with a 27-6 record
took the No. 1 position in the Midwest over
Tennessee.
Though the two split their last two
meetings and the Commodores won the
SEC tournament, the Lady Vols boasted a
stronger record at 25-4 and were the regu
lar-season SEC champions.
Tennessee got the No. 2 seed in the Mid
west, setting up a potential game against
Vanderbilt to determine who moves on to
San Antonio. Their potential meeting
promises to be emotionally charged.
Arizona State, the Pac-10 Tournament
champions and the only Pac-10 team be
sides Stanford to make the tournament,
find itself as the No. 9 seed in this heavily
stacked region. If the Sun Devils can move
past Wisconsin in the first round, they are
likely to find Vanderbilt waiting for them
on its second day of play.
Duke grabbed the No. 1 seed in the East
after finishing the season at 27-3, and Con
necticut, the heavy favorites to take it all,
took the No. 1 spot in the Mideast.
The Huskies are led by a strong senior
