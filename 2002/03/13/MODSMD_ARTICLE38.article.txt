When push came to shove, the top-ranked
Cardinal (14-5) wasn't about to end its impressive

Having split the first two games with Califor

day, 14-4 and losing on Saturday, 2-1 —Stanford
survived a close ( all in Sunday's rubber game to

mile-per-honr fastballs.
At the plate, the opportunistic Cardinal capi

run apiece off of a double play, a wild pitch, and
a sacrifice fly.
Junior designated hitter Jason Cooper ex

in outstanding fashion, blasting a tape-measure
solo home run to right field in the sixth inning.
That shot gave Cooper four home runs and 23
