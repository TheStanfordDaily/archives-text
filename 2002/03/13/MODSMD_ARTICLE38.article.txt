### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
When push came to shove, the top-ranked
Cardinal (14-5) wasn't about to end its impressive
run of eight consecutive series victories that dates
back to last season.

Friday: No. 1 Stanford 14, California 4
Saturday: California 2, No. 1 Stanford 1
Sunday: No. 1 Stanford 4, California 2

Having split the first two games with Califor
nia (13-9) — with the Cardinal winning on Fri
day, 14-4 and losing on Saturday, 2-1 —Stanford
survived a close ( all in Sunday's rubber game to

continue the streak, holding on fora 4-2 victory
behind the strong starting pitching of sophomore
hurler John Hudgins.
Getting the nod as the third starter in the Car
dinal rotation for the second straight weekend,
Hudgins threw six strong innings, allowing only
one run on six hits to go to 3-0 on the season.
Senior Dan Rich and junior Darin Naatjes fin
ished the job out of the bullpen, as Rich threw 2
2/3 impressive innings, striking out five, and
Naatjes grabbed his first-ever save by getting the
only batter he faced, Conor Jackson, to ground
out weakly back to the mound.
With two outs in the bottom of the ninth,
down by two runs and with two runners on base,
Jackson stepped up to the plate with seven
homers on the short season — including a 1 Oth
inning grand slam to beat Georgetown on Tues

day — l(X)king once again to end the game with
one swing.
However, Stanford's newest two-sport star
(the 6-7 Naatjes is also a backup tight end on the
football team) had other ideas, winning the
power matchup with a steady diet of 90-plns
mile-per-honr fastballs.
At the plate, the opportunistic Cardinal capi
talized in an unlikely array of situations, scoring a
run apiece off of a double play, a wild pitch, and
a sacrifice fly.
Junior designated hitter Jason Cooper ex
tended his career-high hitting streak to 11 games
in outstanding fashion, blasting a tape-measure
solo home run to right field in the sixth inning.
That shot gave Cooper four home runs and 23

Junior catcher Ryan Garko and the No. 1 Stanford baseball team cap
tured their eightn straight series victory by beating California twice last
weekend in Berkeley.
RBI on the season, capping off an
awesome weekend in which he blast
ed three homers and drove in six
runs, wrestling the team lead in RBI
away from freshman standout first
baseman Donny Lucy in the process.
'Hie win saved the Cardinal from
its first regular season series loss
since April 2001 — ironically,
against Cal — and the Cardinal had
to work for every run.
"It was a good series," said head
coach Mark Marquess. "Both teams
played three excellent games."
In Friday night's series opener,
the Cardinal recovered from a slow

start to beat the Bears, 15-4, and
stayed a perfect 6-0 in this season's
Friday openers.
Cal hurler Trevor Hutchinson
shut down the Cardinal for six in
nings, as the Bears took a 4-0 lead
into the seventh inning.
However, the Stanford bats
quickly woke up from their nap,
bashing out seven runs in the sev
enth inning and eight runs in the
top of the eighth to win by a com
fortable 11-run margin.
In the lightning-quick 15-run
barrage, the Cardinal knocked four
long balls out of Evans Diamond, as
Cooper delivered his first ever two
homer game, while junior catcher
Ryan Garko and sophomore out
fielder Carlos Quentin each had a
dinger of their own.

Junior righthander Jeremy
Guthrie (5-0) got his 10th consecu
tive win for Stanford, giving up four
runs on only five hits in his seven in
nings of work.
Cardinal relievers junior Ryan
McCally and Naatjes finished the
job, each throwing 1 inning of
scoreless ball.
The Bears responded from Fri
day's defeat with a 2-1 victory on
Saturday afternoon, as Cal's Brian
Montalbo outlasted Cardinal ju
nior Tim Cunningham in a pitch
er's duel.
Giving up only one run on five
hits in 7 1/3 innings, Montalbo (2-
3) shut down the hot Cardinal bats
as the Bears clawed out two runs
in the bottom of the fifth inning to
take a 2-0 lead.
