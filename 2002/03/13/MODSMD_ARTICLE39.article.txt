# No. 2 men's tennis takes care of business
## Card blanks Arizona and then disposes of Arizona State 
### JERRY LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its final showdown this
quarter, the second-ranked Stan
ford's men's tennis team sent Ari
zona and Arizona State packing
back to the desert.
Stanford's (11-1) first face-off
of the weekend was against No.
47 Arizona (7-6) on Friday. The
Cardinal showcased its abilities,
blowing away the Wildcats, 7-0.
Stanford wrapped up the
doubles point after the top
ranked team of juniors Scott
Lipsky and David Martin and
the No. 14 pair of junior Ryan
Haviland and senior K.J. Hip
pensteel both crushed their op

ponents, 8-3. A swinging battle
on court three stretched to a
tiebreaker, with sophomore Joe
Kao and freshman Sam War
burg edging out the Wildcat tan
dem of Arnaud Agniel and Colin
O'Grady, 9-8 (7-4).
The Cardinal, in top form,
then proceeded to rout the Wild
cats in singles play.
The only Arizona player to
put up any resistance was No. 55
Steven Capriati, who battled No.
4 Hippensteel in a three-set en
durance match. Hippensteel,
after losing the second set with
one break, took command early
in the third set and eventually
put Capriati away, 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.
The rest of the Arizona squad
crumbled after Stanford domi
nated the doubles matches.
No. 26 Martin destroyed Whi
Kim, 6-2, 6-0, during a match
where Kim could be heard re
peatedly complaining that Mar

tin would not miss a shot.
No. 45 Haviland defeated
Tom Lloyd, 6-4, 6-0. Haviland
lost the first two games, only to
charge back to take 12 of the next
14. No. 58 Lipsky, Warburg, and
freshman Phil Sheng added to
the stampede with easy straight
set victories.
Stanford's second duel in as
many days came against No. 42
Arizona State (6-4) on Saturday.
Stanford, riding high after Fri
day's blowout, roped in the Sun
Devils with a 6-1 victory that pro
vided ample room for surprises.
In a shocking upset, unranked
Sun Devil Matt Klinger outlasted
Hippensteel, 6-7, 7-5, 7-6, in a
three-set marathon.
In a strange contrast to the
struggle on court one, the Cardi
nal swept the Sun Devils in the
other five singles matches in
straight sets, with no Stanford
player losing more than 7 games

in a match.
The Cardinal had captured
the doubles point of the match
with Lipsky / Martin thrashing
the No. 45 pair of Mitchell
Bowen and Matt Klinger, 8-2.
Stanford split the other two
doubles sets with Haviland / Hip
pensteel easily handling their op
ponents, 8-4, and Sheng / War
burg losing a close 8-6 decision.
Stanford now holds a 47-1 all
time record against Arizona, and
a 43-1 record against Arizona
State.
Stanford has dropped only
two points during its current
four match dual-meet winning
streak. The singles upset on Sat
urday marks the first singles
match lost by the Cardinal since
Feb. 25.
The doubles teams have been
even more unstoppable this year.

put up any resistance was No. 55
Steven Capriati, who battled No.
4 Hippensteel in a three-set en
durance match. Hippensteel,
after losing the second set with
one break, took command early
in the third set and eventually
put Capriati away, 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.
The rest of the Arizona squad
crumbled after Stanford domi
nated the doubles matches.
No. 26 Martin destroyed Whi
Kim, 6-2, 6-0, during a match
where Kim could be heard re
peatedly complaining that Mar

tin would not miss a shot.
No. 45 Haviland defeated
Tom Lloyd, 6-4, 6-0. Haviland
lost the first two games, only to
charge back to take 12 of the next
14. No. 58 Lipsky, Warburg, and
freshman Phil Sheng added to
the stampede with easy straight
set victories.
Stanford's second duel in as
many days came against No. 42
Arizona State (6-4) on Saturday.
Stanford, riding high after Fri
day's blowout, roped in the Sun
Devils with a 6-1 victory that pro
vided ample room for surprises.
In a shocking upset, unranked
Sun Devil Matt Klinger outlasted
Hippensteel, 6-7, 7-5, 7-6, in a
three-set marathon.
In a strange contrast to the
struggle on court one, the Cardi
nal swept the Sun Devils in the
other five singles matches in
straight sets, with no Stanford
player losing more than 7 games

in a match.
The Cardinal had captured
the doubles point of the match
with Lipsky / Martin thrashing
the No. 45 pair of Mitchell
Bowen and Matt Klinger, 8-2.
Stanford split the other two
doubles sets with Haviland / Hip
pensteel easily handling their op
ponents, 8-4, and Sheng / War
burg losing a close 8-6 decision.
Stanford now holds a 47-1 all
time record against Arizona, and
a 43-1 record against Arizona
State.
Stanford has dropped only
two points during its current
four match dual-meet winning
streak. The singles upset on Sat
urday marks the first singles
match lost by the Cardinal since
Feb. 25.
The doubles teams have been
even more unstoppable this year.
