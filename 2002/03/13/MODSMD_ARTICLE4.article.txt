# Band to travel to NCAAs
## 
### ERIKKA INNES STAFF WRITER 
On Monday, Dean of Students
Marc Wais announced the removal
of the travel suspension placed on
the Stanford Band on Feb. 28. The
Band will now be allowed to attend
the men's and women's NCAA Bas
ketball Tournaments.
According to Assistant Manager
Aram Cretan, the travel suspension
was originally issued when an Ath
letic Department official came to
"check out the placement of fire
strobes" in the Band Shak.
The official found evidence of al
cohol consumption â€” a pony keg
and a mess on the floor which Cre
tan says was a "mixture of food
products, like flour and ketchup."
Later it was discovered that four
individuals had been drinking in
the Band Shak on "Tree Night."
As part of the new plan to rein
state the Band's traveling privileges,
the Athletic Department has sus
pended the four individuals from
participating in Band events until
April 9.
"Should the University be made
aware that any of these individuals
violate this suspension, the Band's
status as a recognized student or
ganization will be suspended im
mediately pending the outcome of
the Band Review Committee,"
said Wais. "Loss of recognition sta
tus means the Band will not be able
to use the Stanford name."
The Band was required to sub-

Mit a proposal to the Office of Stu
dent Activities and the Athletic De
partment. According to the Band's
Public Relations Director Mike
Huijon, the document contained
"a set of guidelines under which
[the Band plans] to carry out the al
cohol suspension, a voluntary ex
tension of that suspension and
plans for taking collective responsi
bility for [their] actions."
Wais supported the idea of
the Band dealing with its prob
lems internally.
"One of our bedrock principles is
that we don't chaperone students,"
Wais said. "It speaks to the trust we
have that student groups will do the
right thing. We're not going to
change that policy." However, Wais
said he would prefer Band mem
bers to take individual, rather than
collective, responsibility.
"While we look forward to
working with the Band to ad
dress University concerns, the
ultimate responsibility rests with
each and every member of the
Band," Wais said.
Wais also said he disliked
being forced to discipline a stu
dent group.
"This is a worst-case scenario,"
he said. "A last resort, but we're at
that point."
Huijon said that the Band want
ed to reach an acceptable agree
ment with the OSA and the Athletic
Department.
"We remain confident that the
aims of Stanford officialdom are not

at base incompatible with those of
the Stanford Band, and the
progress made to date supports us
in that view," said Huijon. "The
Band is determined to reach a com
promise acceptable to all."
Wais said he wanted to reach an
acceptable resolution to the current
Band situation.
"It is our goal to support a Stan
ford Band that represents Stan
ford humor, creativity and fun in a
safe and responsible fashion,"
Wais said.
Wais added that he has a person
al affection for the Band.
"I'm a big fan of the Band," Wais
said. "They played at my 40th birth
day party."
Cretan seemed to agree with
Wais that the Band and administra
tion can reach a solution acceptable
to both parties.
"We're looking forward to work
ing with Wais [and] to resolving this
in a manner that's beneficial to
everybody," Cretan said.
While the travel suspension
has been revoked, the alcohol sus
pension will remain. Whether it
will be lifted or not depends on
the decisions made by a commit
tee comprised of Band student
and alumni members and Uni
versity staff.
"The alcohol suspension will
remain in effect until the Band
committee comes up with their
final recommendations," said As
sociate Dean of Students Morris
Graves.
