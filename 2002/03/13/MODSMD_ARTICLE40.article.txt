# Baseball readies for more challenges over break
## Top-ranked Cardinal will face Texas, Southern California 
### MAC LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
After starting the season with
matchups against perennial national
championship contenders No. 3 Florida
State and No. 13 Cal-State Fullerton, the
top-ranked Cardinal (14-5) has had a
couple weeks of play against so-called
lesser competition.
But that's about to change.
When most Stanford students are
engaging in Spring Break debauchery
or relaxing at home and watching it on
MTV, the Stanford baseball team will
be hard at work trying to maintain its
No. 1 ranking against the likes of No. 18
Texas (16-6) and the defending Pacific
10 Conference champions, Southern
California (7-8).

Off for the next two weeks because of
finals, the Cardinal will return to the di
amond on March 23 fora three-game
non-conference series at Dedeaux Field
on the campus of USC.
USC has stumbled out of the gates
this season, dropping from a preseason
No. 4 ranking all the way out of the top
25. But in no way are the Trojans a team
to be taken lightly, especially right before
the start of "conference play."
"They're definitely a tough team
from year to year," said junior catcher
Ryan Garko. "They are always well
coached and have great pitching, so the
series should be a good marking suck for
Pac-10 play."
After the three-game set at USC, the
Cardinal will travel back to Sunken Dia
mond to duke it out with Texas from
March 28 to March 30.
The Longhorns have become an an
nual opponent for the Cardinal since
1998, and Stanford has fared quite well
in what is a budding rivalry, going 6-4-1
in eleven games.

At the plate for Texas, everything
starts with the leadoff man, sophomore
second baseman Tim Moss. With great
ability to hit and run — as shown by his
.387 batting average and 12 stolen bases
in 13 attempts — Moss is the spark plug
for the Longhorns. It will be imperative
for Stanford pitchers to keep the speed
ster off the basepat hs.
Like USC, Texas is renowned for its
strong pitching, and the Longhorns re
turn seven hurlers from last season's staff
that ranked third in the nation with a
3.17 ERA. Sophomore southpaw Justin
Simmons has been leading the charge
this season, going 5-0 with a 2.45 ERA
and an impressive two complete games.
Simmons and the rest of the Texas
arms should be a great test for the
Cardinal bats that have started the
season red hot.
Through the team's first 19 games,
the Cardinal has posted an average of 8.5
runs per game on its opponents, show
ing a great ability to launch big innings.
The team has scored five or more runs in

an inning an astonishing 12 times.
Junior designated hitter Jason
Cooper leads the team with a .455 bat
ting average to go along with four home
runs and a team-leading 23 RBI, while
Garko holds the team lead in home
runs with five.
On the mound, the Cardinal is com
ing into its own as well. As the team looks
as if it has finally found the third starter
in sophomore John Hudgins to round
out the starting rotation with junior aces
Jeremy Guthrie and Tim Cunningham.
Making the tough transition from a
reliever to a starter, Hudgins has ex
celled in his two starts for the Cardinal,
winning both games and giving the team
much-needed stability at an extremely
important position before the start of
Pac-10 play.
With the starting rotation set and the
bats as lethal as they have been, the Car
dinal seems ready to batde the tough
competition that lies ahead and finish
the non-conference schedule in the same
impressive manner in which it started.
