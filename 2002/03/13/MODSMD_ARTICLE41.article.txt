### MARK THOMA EDITORIALS STAFF 
Not many students feel a sense of
relief during Dead Week, but the
No. 3 Stanford women's tennis
team (12-1) certainly does.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 5,
No. 9 Arizona State 2
Sunday: No. 3 Stanford 5,
No. 34 Arizona 2

Having gone on the road to de
feat both No. 9 Arizona State (7-2)
and No. 34 Arizona (7-6) by a 5-2
margin, the Cardinal can relax ten
nis-wise fora bit and f<x:us on finals.
"We can breathe a sigh of relief to
have those matches under our

belts," senior Gabriela lustra said.
The trip to Arizona is traditional
ly a tough test eveiy year for the Car
dinal, due to often-tough conditions
and facing—on consecutive days—
two teams that play tenaciously on
their home courts.
This year was no exception.
"Both schools were very tough,"
Lastra said. "They didn't break
down and give anything to us at all.
They were tough competitors."
Arizona State gave the Cardinal a
shock on Friday by capturing the
doubles point to go up, 1-0. Adria
Engel and Dora Krustulovic upset
senior Lauren Kalvaria and
the country's No. 2 doubles tandem,
8-4. Stanford bounced back as its
No. 8 team of sophomore Lauren
Barnikow and freshman Erin Bui -
dette beat Mhairi Brown and

Megan Yeats 8-4.
However, senior Keiko Tokuda
and freshman Stoiy Tweedie-Yates
fell to Joslynn Burkett and Cindy
Sureephong, 8-4, and the Wildcats
captured the point.
The Cardinal rebounded quick
ly from this disappointment,
though, winning five of six singles
matches for the final 5-2 margin.
Kalvaria, ranked No. 11 nation
ally, outlasted No. 29 Engel in a
hard-fought first-flight match, 6-3,
7-6. No. 16 lustra put away Krus
tulovic, 6-3, 6-1.
No. 14 Barnikow fell to Mhairi
Brown, 6-0, 6-4, but the Cardinal
rallied to win the last three matches.
No. 21 Burdette easily handled
Yeats, 6-2, 6-1, and Tokuda over
matched Sureephong, 6-3, 6-0.
Sophomore Emilia Anderson
closed out singles by defeating Lau
ren (lolalillo 6-0,7-5.
"1 think Arizona Suite was defi
nitely a tough team," Burdette said.
The Sun Devils went on to
knock off No. 14 California, 4-3,
on Saturday.
Stanford had its own successful
Saturday, winning the doubles
point and four of six singles match
es against Arizona.
Kalvaria and Lastra knocked off
No. 13 Maja Mlakar and Debbie
Larocque, 8-4. Barnikow and Bur
dette lost a tough match, 9-7, to
Marie-Pier Pouliot and Laresa
Marino, but Tokuda and Tweedie-
Yates downed Dianne Hollands
and Brooke Taylor, 8-5, to give the
Cardinal the 1 -0 advantage heading
into singles play.
Mlakar, ranked No. 25 in singles,
upset Kalvaria, 6-1, 7-6 in the first
flight, and Hollands outlasted
Barnikow in the third flight, 6-3,7-6.
However, Lastra had little trou
ble with No. 77 Larocque, winning
6-0,6-2. The Cardinal's depth came
in handy, as the bottom half of the
singles lineup was dominant: each
player won easily in straight sets,
clinching the win for the Stanford.

matched Pouliot, 6-1, 6-0, and An
derson dismissed Daniela Torres, 6-
1,6-0.
"It always seems harder to play in
Arizona," Lastra said. "Our team
competed well and came out on top
in the end."
The Cardinal had prepared
lor extreme conditions, but the
weather was not exorbitantly
warm, and the environment was
less than friendly.
"They both had some fans that
were a factor mentally. They got us
fired up," Burdette said. "I don't
think [the weather] hurt any of us."

Stanford doesn't play again until
a March 26 home date against No.
45 Harvard. The team subsequent
ly travels to Washington State and
No. 20 Washington on March 28,
and March 29, respectively.
"Everyone's looking forward
to competing," Burdette said.
"It's definitely going to step up
after exams."
Although the practice schedule is
abbreviated for finals, the team's
normal practice and competition
will resume immediately afterwards
and continues right through spring
break. The team doesn't mind,
however.
"I like the fact that we don't have
time oil," Lastra said. "I feel like I've
gotten in a groove and I want to
maintain it."

The Cardinal had prepared

"They both had some fans that

Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 5,
No. 9 Arizona State 2
Sunday: No. 3 Stanford 5,
No. 34 Arizona 2

Having gone on the road to de
feat both No. 9 Arizona State (7-2)
and No. 34 Arizona (7-6) by a 5-2
margin, the Cardinal can relax ten
nis-wise fora bit and f<x:us on finals.
"We can breathe a sigh of relief to
have those matches under our

belts," senior Gabriela lustra said.
The trip to Arizona is traditional
ly a tough test eveiy year for the Car
dinal, due to often-tough conditions
and facing—on consecutive days—
two teams that play tenaciously on
their home courts.
This year was no exception.
"Both schools were very tough,"
Lastra said. "They didn't break
down and give anything to us at all.
They were tough competitors."
Arizona State gave the Cardinal a
shock on Friday by capturing the
doubles point to go up, 1-0. Adria
Engel and Dora Krustulovic upset
senior Lauren Kalvaria and
the country's No. 2 doubles tandem,
8-4. Stanford bounced back as its
No. 8 team of sophomore Lauren
Barnikow and freshman Erin Bui -
dette beat Mhairi Brown and

Megan Yeats 8-4.
However, senior Keiko Tokuda
and freshman Stoiy Tweedie-Yates
fell to Joslynn Burkett and Cindy
Sureephong, 8-4, and the Wildcats
captured the point.
The Cardinal rebounded quick
ly from this disappointment,
though, winning five of six singles
matches for the final 5-2 margin.
Kalvaria, ranked No. 11 nation
ally, outlasted No. 29 Engel in a
hard-fought first-flight match, 6-3,
7-6. No. 16 lustra put away Krus
tulovic, 6-3, 6-1.
No. 14 Barnikow fell to Mhairi
Brown, 6-0, 6-4, but the Cardinal
rallied to win the last three matches.
No. 21 Burdette easily handled
Yeats, 6-2, 6-1, and Tokuda over
matched Sureephong, 6-3, 6-0.
Sophomore Emilia Anderson
closed out singles by defeating Lau
ren (lolalillo 6-0,7-5.
"1 think Arizona Suite was defi
nitely a tough team," Burdette said.
The Sun Devils went on to
knock off No. 14 California, 4-3,
on Saturday.
Stanford had its own successful
Saturday, winning the doubles
point and four of six singles match
es against Arizona.
Kalvaria and Lastra knocked off
No. 13 Maja Mlakar and Debbie
Larocque, 8-4. Barnikow and Bur
dette lost a tough match, 9-7, to

and Brooke Taylor, 8-5, to give the
Cardinal the 1 -0 advantage heading
into singles play.
Mlakar, ranked No. 25 in singles,
upset Kalvaria, 6-1, 7-6 in the first
flight, and Hollands outlasted
Barnikow in the third flight, 6-3,7-6.
However, Lastra had little trou
ble with No. 77 Larocque, winning
6-0,6-2. The Cardinal's depth came
in handy, as the bottom half of the
singles lineup was dominant: each
player won easily in straight sets,
clinching the win for the Stanford.
