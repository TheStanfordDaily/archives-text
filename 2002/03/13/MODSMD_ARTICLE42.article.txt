### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
The universal home run chant of "it's going, it's
going, it's gone" became a common utterance this
weekend at the Speedline Invitational where the No.
3 Cardinal softball team (26-2) became tournament
champions for the third time this season, this time
thanks to the long ball.
Stanford roped 10 pitches over the fence in seven
games to capture the tournament title.
The Cardinal offense was hot all around as the line
up came through in the Florida showcase.
Leading the team at the plate was senior outfielder
Jessica Mendoza, who knocked four of the homers out
of the park, including two in the championship game.
Mendoza was named the most valuable player of the
tournament despite missing the first game of her four
year career on Saturday due to an elbow injury.
The first Cardinal victim, Western Michigan, felt
Mendoza's wrath immediately as the senior kicked off
the routing with a solo home run in the first inning.
The Stanford lineup followed the three-time All-
American's example by producing nine runs before
the Broncos even came to bat.
The Cardinal recorded 15 hits in the matchup,

three of which belonged to senior outfielder Jessica
Draemel, who picked up extra-base hits in all three of
her at-bats. Freshman infielder Meghan Sickler also
contributed, going 3-4 with three runs and two RBI.
Stanford took the win in five innings of play, scor
ing 14 runs while junior pitcher Maureen LeCocq al
lowed just one Bronco to cross the plate.
Following the first-game blowout, the Cardinal
took on Illinois-Chicago for the nightcap.
The Flames came out ready to play and challenged
Stanford for seven hard-fought innings.
Stanford drew first blood as Mendoza walked to
reach base in the bottom of the first inning before
stealing second and finally scoring on an error by the
Flames' second baseman.
Mendoza and senior first baseman Sarah Beeson
teamed up in the bottom of the third to notch the sec
ond run of the game when Beeson drove in Mendoza
with a single to left.
Ilinois-Chicago attempted a come back in the
top of the sixth when Flames' shortstop Jennifer
Tiffany scored on an error, but Cardinal junior
pitcher Tori Nyberg stopped the rally there and
finished out the game to record her 10th complete-
