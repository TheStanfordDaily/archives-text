# Coach Hamada leaves lasting legacy
## 
### RICO ANDRADE GUEST COLUMNIST 
"People make the mistake of thinking that a
coach motivates you through emotion or locker
room speeches. It's not true. Nothing motivates you
more than the feeling that the guy really knows what
he's doing. And with Coach, you feel that he's
smarter than the people you're playing. He tells you
they're gonna do something, and they do it, and
when this happens over and over again, well, that
gets you psyched."
That is how Patriots tackle Chad Eaton described
coach Hill Belichick during Super Bowl XXXVI. For
all I know, he could have been describing our men's
gymnastics coach, Sadao Hamada, who will retire at
the end of this season after 30 years at Stanford.
I first met Sadao at Disney World during the ju
nior Olympic National Championships in 1997. I
miraculously (or mistakenly) received an acceptance
letter from Stanford just weeks before, and he didn't
know who I was. 1 wanted to meet him, but I was a lit
tle nervous to introduce myself.
At first glance, Sadao has a stoic, intimidating pres
ence. He had just won three NCAA Championships
and coached Jair Lynch to a silver medal at the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta. I was a little star-struck
and I felt that whenever he entered the arena, all eyes
were on him.
Besides, 1 had no business in collegiate gymnastics.
I was just eliminated in the first day of competition,
barely finishing in the top 100. It was my last junior
meet, and not even the then-lowly University of Min
nesota, where I personally knew the coaches, showed

any interest in my gymnastics.
I clearly lacked any hint of form and basics. Why
would Sadao want me on his team?
Gymnastics or no gymnastics, 1 was going to Stan
ford. And, after three days of competition, 1 finally
walked up to him.
"I look forward to working with you in Septem
ber," he told me.
I wasn't expecting that. Those words extended my
gymnastics career by at least another four years.
He meant it— I don't know how many coaches are
so supportive of walk-ons. I'm really thankful he gave
me an opportunity to join the team, because the past
five years have been the happiest time of my life.
This is one of Sadao's greatest assets — regardless
of your skill level, he will give you a chance. As long as
you put in the effort, he will work with you to make
you a better gymnast. In a way, this frustrates the top
gymnasts who expect him to do all of the motivation
al work. But Sadao is the type of coach who never
screams, never panics and very rarely gives motiva
tional speeches. Once you understand his coaching
style, and place complete trust in his plans and tech
niques, you flourish under his system.
I would characterize Sadao's coaching system as a
"gamble" of sorts. He's a very innovative coach, who
is willing to try something different but riskier in
hopes of a greater payoff. It might not always work,
but when it works, it really works.
For example, instead of perfecting "sure-hit"
routines at the beginning of the season, we start
with routines above our physical ability, even
