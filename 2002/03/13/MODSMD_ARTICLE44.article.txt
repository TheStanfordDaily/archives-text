Five matches.
That it is all that is left of the dwindling regular
season, as the No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball team
(12-8, 11-6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
fights for home-court advantage in the first round
of the MPSF tournament.
"We need to put together our best string of vol
leyball in April," said coach Don Shaw.
It won't be easy â€” among the five opponents re
maining are No. 3 Pepperdine (15-4, 10-2) and No.
12 Long Beach State (7-12, 5-8). Earlier in the sea
son, the Cardinal pushed both teams to five games,
ultimately losing both matches, 3-2.
And last weekend's play doesn't make the situa
tion look any better.
On Saturday, the Cardinal crumbled to top
ranked UCLA, 32-30, 30-21, 30-24, in what should
have been an extremely competitive matchup.
The UCLA-Stanford rivalry dates back to last
year. After the Cardinal won both regular-season
matches against the Bruins, UCLA robbed Stanford
of a chance at an NCAA tournament bid by defeat
ing the Cardinal in a heated five-game match in the
MPSF playoffs.
In the teams' first meeting this year on Feb. 16,
the Cardinal won in four games (29-31, 30-24, 31-
29, 30-25), resulting in an upset that temporarily

docked UCIA in the polls.
On Saturday, however, in front of its largest
home crowd of the season, UCLA more than
avenged its earlier loss.
Fans were reminded of the February match in
the first game, when the Cardinal rebounded from
a four-point deficit to tie the game at 10-10 before
pulling out to a 12-10 lead. The two seemingly
equally matched teams were tied at 29-29 and again
at 30-30, but the Bruins squeaked by, 32-30.
In sharp contrast to the first game, the next two
games were anything but reminiscent of the Febru
ary matchup. The Bruins jumped out to leads that
proved to be insurmountable for the Cardinal, de
molishing its four-game winning streak.
Returning from injury, junior outside hitter Billy
Strickland and senior outside hitter Marcus Skacel
boosted the Cardinal offense by posting 13 kills
apiece. Redshirt freshmen Kevin Hansen provided
31 assists and two blocks in an effort that ultimately
proved insufficient.
The Bruins outblocked the Cardinal 8.5 - 4.5
and hit at a .478 clip, dominating Stanford's .304
hitting percentage.
The weekend, however, was not entirely un
successful.
On Friday, the Cardinal swept No. 10 UC-Irvine
(10-10, 5-9) in a decisive three-game match (30-23,
