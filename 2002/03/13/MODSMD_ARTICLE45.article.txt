# Women's water polo sinks Hawaii, remains undefeated
## Ten players score in Cardinal rout of the Rainbow Wahine 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 ranked women's water polo
team did not let itself take any vacation time
when it traveled to the University of Hawaii
last weekend.
The Cardinal (11-0, 3-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) simply took care of busi
ness as it defeated the Rainbow Wahine (7-6,
1-3 MPSF) 13-4 at the Duke Kahanamoku
Aquatic Complex in Honolulu.
With the win, Stanford remains perfect
this season with 11 straight victories, includ
ing three conference wins.
The Cardinal not only used a well-bal
anced attack, as 10 different players scored in
the match, but it also came out quick and
strong, with four goals in the first quarter.
After a slowdown in goal production in the
second quarter, which saw the Cardinal and

the Rainbow Wahine score once each, the
match went into the break at 5-1.
A five-goal third quarter essentially sealed
the match for the Stanford women, and the
Cardinal easily cruised to a 13-4 victory.
Leading the barrage was junior Julie
Gardner, last week's Player of the Week.
Gardner tallied three goals in the win. Sopho
more Brenda Villa added two more in the net
for the Cardinal while sophomores Shannon
Avrett, Jeanine Jackson, Wendy Watkins and
Lauren Faust, seniors Margie Dingeldein and
Kate Pettit and freshmen Cindy Henn and
Heather Stamper rounded out the scoring
for Stanford. They each netted one goal.
In goal, junior Jackie Frank recorded six
saves on the day.
"It was really great to see our goals spread
out," Avrett said. "It was Heather's first colle
giate goal, Lauren's first goal of the season. It
shows that we have depth and that anyone
has the ability to go into the game and make
something positive happen."
Stanford's next game will be on March 23
against Pacific at Avery Aquatics Center.
