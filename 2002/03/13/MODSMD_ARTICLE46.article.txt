# Both club ultimate teams shine

Club sports teams at Stanford may not always draw
the largest crowds.
And they certainly don't have the kind of loyal fol
lowing that gives most of Stanford's varsity teams a
large fan base at every home event.

CLUB SPORTS ROUNDUP

But as Bloodthirsty, Stanford's men's ultimate
team, showed at the Stanford Invitational on March 7
and 8, club teams get to reap the benefits of home field
advantage every now and then too.
Playing in front of a huge crowd that included the
Stanford Band, Bloodthirsty made up fora pool-play
loss to Davis by trouncing the Dogs, 15-7, in the finals
to claim the title at the team's annual invitational for
the first time since 1997.
The Band was also present at Stanford's 15-10 win
over longtime rival UC-Santa Barbara in the semifi
nals, Bloodthirsty's second win over Black Tide in the
tournament.
"The semis and finals were incredible," said grad
student Mike Whitaker. Whitaker is Bloodthirsty's
nominee for the Callahan Award, given annually to
the nation's best college ultimate player.
"Not only did we get to play in front of the Band,
which was awesome, and tons of our fans, but we also
eliminated our biggest traditional rival, Santa Bar
bara, in the semis, and we were able to avenge our
only college loss of the season in the finals against
Davis. You can't ask fora better way to win a tourna
ment," said Whitaker.
Bloodthirsty breezed through pool play,
outscoring UC-Santa Barbara, Brown, and UC-
Santa Cruz by a combined 39-16 margin as the team

continued its undefeated streak against college
teams on the year.
But that streak came to a sudden end in Blood
thirsty's last game on Saturday against Davis, a
game to determine seeding for Sunday's quarterfi
nal round.
The Cardinal squad looked sharp on offense
early, but Davis took advantage of Bloodthirsty's
heavy legs on defense to keep the match even
through halftime. Davis capitalized on a sloppy
stretch by the Stanford offense early in the second
half, taking six of the first seven points before hold
ing on fora 15-13 win.
But Bloodthirsty would get its revenge on the
Dogs in Sunday's championship match, outplaying
Davis on both sides of the field throughout the
game.
Stanford's deep game was in full gear early and
Bloodthirsty's tight marking forced a number of
Davis turnovers, as Stanford took an 8-5 lead into the
half. With the title in sight, the Stanford squad turned
on the afterburners after halftime, blowing out the
Dogs, 7-2, in the second half to close the tournament
with a 15-7 win.
Superfly, Stanford's women's team, went 4-2 in the
women's tournament, having its run at a title on home
turf cut short by UC-San Diego in the semifinals.
Superfly got off to an ominous start in pool play on
Friday, letting a feisty Oregon squad battle back to
steal a 13-12 win in its second game.
The Cardinal women rebounded with a dominat
ing 13-6 win over Tufts to close out pool play and slid
past British Columbia, 15-10, in its last match of the
day to advance to Sunday's quarterfinals.
Stanford easily handled 2000 national champions
Carleton, 15-8, in the quarterfinals before falling, 15-
9, to UC-San Diego in the semis.
