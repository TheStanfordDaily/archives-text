# Four wrestlers to hit mats at NCAAs
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you asked average Stanford students
where they'd like to spend their spring
break, you probably wouldn't expect them
to answer Albany, N.Y.
But for four members of the Stanford
wrestling team, there is no place they
would rather be headed. Well, at least for
a few days.
Senior Levi Weikel-Magden, sopho
more Nathan Peterson and redshirt fresh
men Brad Metzler and Matt Gentry
punched their tickets to the NCAA Cham
pionships, to be held March 21 through
March 23 in Albany, with strong showings
at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships two weeks ago.
The four will represent Stanford
against the nation's elite wrestlers in the
final chapter of head coach Steve Bud
die's first year at the helm of the team.
The Cardinal (10-8, 3-4 Pac-10) wrapped
up its best season in recent memory at the
Pac-10 Tournament.
Of the Pac-10's 43 qualifiers, Boise State
and Oregon are each sending eight
wrestlers to the NCAAs, while Arizona
State and Oregon State are sending six

and five, respectively.
The four Cardinal qualifiers are the
most by a Stanford team since 1997.
"I'm hoping that all four of these guys
enjoy the experience and let the crowd
move them instead of intimidate them,"
Buddie said. "The Pac-10 tournament
gave them more confidence than they
had previously."
Weikel-Magden, who has more than
doubled his win total from last season,
went 2-2 at the Pac-lOs in Corvallis, but
one of his wins was probably the biggest of
his career.
On the second day of competition, he
knocked off No. 1 seed Rocky Smart of
Arizona State with a 4-1 decision, before
finishing fourth at 157 pounds.
Peterson, who managed 19 wins during
the regular season despite sitting out sev
eral dual meets with a hand injury, went 5-
1 at the Pac-lOs to capture third place at
125 pounds.
Four of the sophomore's five wins in
the double-elimination tournament came
after he suffered a loss in his second bout.
Gentry turned in the greatest regular
season by a freshman in Stanford history
with 32 wins to lead the team. He added
two more to that total and claimed second

place in the tournament at 149 pounds.
Fellow redshirt freshman Brad Metzler
took advantage of an injury-default victo
ry to win two bouts at Pac-lOs and qualify
for nationals in this year's toughest weight
class, 141 pounds. While none of the Car
dinal's four qualifiers — or any member of
this year's team — has had experience in
the the group doesn't have to look
far to find someone who has.
Buddie qualified three times, finishing
fourth at 167 pounds in 1990.
"The way that you view the NCAAs has
something to do with how many times
you've been there and whether you've wres
tled in that kind of environment before,"
Buddie said. "What I feel confident about is
that all four of our qualifiers have wrestled
in pressure situations already. Most of them,
if not all of them, have wrestled in front of
large crowds in large venues."
The top 12 wrestlers in each weight
class are seeded while the rest of the
matchups are arranged randomly. The
top eight finishers in each weight class are
named All-Americans.
Meanwhile, all of Stanford's wrestlers
continue to work hard leading up to the
big finale. Even those who did not qualify
at the Pac-lOs are doing what they can to

help the team.
"It's important to maintain the team
energy for the guys who are still training,"
Buddie said. "For the most part everyone
is staying in reasonable shape so we can
push these guys and keep them really ex
cited and training hard for the next week."
No matter how Stanford fares in Al
bany, the foundation is set for Stanford to
establish itself as a force in the Pac-10 and
eventually in the nation.
While the Cardinal will lose Weikel-

Magden and senior Brad Selby from the
starting lineup, as well as a host of other se
nior leaders and contributors, it still has a
core group of young talent.
"Anytime you can qualify younger
guys, it's a huge step in the right direc
tion," Buddie said. "Not only do they have
confidence the next year going in and hav
ing seen the NCAA tournament, but that
also trickles down to the rest of the team.
Pretty soon we'll be taking a large team
hopefully."

for nationals in this year's toughest weight
class, 141 pounds. While none of the Car
dinal's four qualifiers — or any member of
this year's team — has had experience in
the the group doesn't have to look
far to find someone who has.
Buddie qualified three times, finishing
fourth at 167 pounds in 1990.
"The way that you view the NCAAs has
something to do with how many times
you've been there and whether you've wres
tled in that kind of environment before,"
Buddie said. "What I feel confident about is
that all four of our qualifiers have wrestled
in pressure situations already. Most of them,
if not all of them, have wrestled in front of
large crowds in large venues."
The top 12 wrestlers in each weight
class are seeded while the rest of the
matchups are arranged randomly. The
top eight finishers in each weight class are
named All-Americans.
Meanwhile, all of Stanford's wrestlers
continue to work hard leading up to the
big finale. Even those who did not qualify
at the Pac-lOs are doing what they can to

help the team.
"It's important to maintain the team
energy for the guys who are still training,"
Buddie said. "For the most part everyone
is staying in reasonable shape so we can
push these guys and keep them really ex
cited and training hard for the next week."
No matter how Stanford fares in Al
bany, the foundation is set for Stanford to
establish itself as a force in the Pac-10 and
eventually in the nation.
While the Cardinal will lose Weikel-

Magden and senior Brad Selby from the
starting lineup, as well as a host of other se
nior leaders and contributors, it still has a
core group of young talent.
"Anytime you can qualify younger
guys, it's a huge step in the right direc
tion," Buddie said. "Not only do they have
confidence the next year going in and hav
ing seen the NCAA tournament, but that
also trickles down to the rest of the team.
Pretty soon we'll be taking a large team
hopefully."

Redshirt freshmen Brad Metzler earned a berth in the NCAA Championships in Albany, NY.
Levi Weikel-Magden, Nathan Peterson and Matt Gentry will also compete for the Cardinal.
If you asked average Stanford students
where they'd like to spend their spring
break, you probably wouldn't expect them
to answer Albany, N.Y.
But for four members of the Stanford
wrestling team, there is no place they
would rather be headed. Well, at least for
a few days.
Senior Levi Weikel-Magden, sopho
more Nathan Peterson and redshirt fresh
men Brad Metzler and Matt Gentry
punched their tickets to the NCAA Cham
pionships, to be held March 21 through
March 23 in Albany, with strong showings
at the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships two weeks ago.
The four will represent Stanford
against the nation's elite wrestlers in the
final chapter of head coach Steve Bud
die's first year at the helm of the team.
The Cardinal (10-8, 3-4 Pac-10) wrapped
up its best season in recent memory at the
Pac-10 Tournament.
Of the Pac-10's 43 qualifiers, Boise State
and Oregon are each sending eight
wrestlers to the NCAAs, while Arizona
State and Oregon State are sending six

and five, respectively.
The four Cardinal qualifiers are the
most by a Stanford team since 1997.
"I'm hoping that all four of these guys
enjoy the experience and let the crowd
move them instead of intimidate them,"
Buddie said. "The Pac-10 tournament
gave them more confidence than they
had previously."
Weikel-Magden, who has more than
doubled his win total from last season,
went 2-2 at the Pac-lOs in Corvallis, but
one of his wins was probably the biggest of
his career.
On the second day of competition, he
knocked off No. 1 seed Rocky Smart of
Arizona State with a 4-1 decision, before
finishing fourth at 157 pounds.
Peterson, who managed 19 wins during
the regular season despite sitting out sev
eral dual meets with a hand injury, went 5-
1 at the Pac-lOs to capture third place at
125 pounds.
Four of the sophomore's five wins in
the double-elimination tournament came
after he suffered a loss in his second bout.
Gentry turned in the greatest regular
season by a freshman in Stanford history
with 32 wins to lead the team. He added
two more to that total and claimed second

place in the tournament at 149 pounds.
Fellow redshirt freshman Brad Metzler
took advantage of an injury-default victo
ry to win two bouts at Pac-lOs and qualify
for nationals in this year's toughest weight
class, 141 pounds. While none of the Car
dinal's four qualifiers — or any member of
