It would have been a happy ending to a four
game homestand if the Cardinal had come out vic
torious against a non-West Coast opponent.
However, the women's lacrosse team was unable
to pull out a win against Notre Dame, which
pounded the Stanford squad, 10-5, at Stanford Sta
dium on Saturday.
The loss to Notre Dame (2-0) was a tough re
minder of the strides the Cardinal still needs to
make before it can pose a real threat to the strong
opponents it has left to face this season.
Heading into the game, it seemed that Stanford
was hungry to beat the Fighting Irish and to prove
that its prowess extends beyond its ability to consis
tently defeat West Coast rivals such as California,
St. Mary's, and UC-Davis.
The players were confident that they had the
skill level to take on the daunting Notre Dame
squad, but when the final buzzer sounded, the
scoreboard seemed to suggest otherwise. The Car
dinal walked away from the game wondering how
exactly it had let this great opportunity for victory
slip away.
"We think we are a better team than they are,"
said sophomore midfielder Noor Dawood. "We
definitely could have beaten them if we came out
on fire today and were really ready to play."
Senior tri-captain attacker Liz Britt echoed Da
wood's sentiments.
"Yesterday we didn't really show what we are ca

pable of," she said.
The Irish took an early lead in the game and
never let Stanford get within one goal for the re
mainder of the match.
The first half saw Stanford goals from freshman
attacker Ali Salatti and sophomore midfielder Abbi
Mills, but the Irish took a 5-2 lead into halftime.
The momentum of the game appeared to be
switching back and forth between the Irish and the
Cardinal, as easy midfield transitioning by both
teams led to many offensive opportunities on both
sides of the field.
Stanford was thwarted by aggressive Notre
Dame goalie Jen White, who made several key in
terceptions as the Cardinal tried to set up scoring
plays.
Despite the halftime score, Stanford seemed
eager to start the second half.
Stanford sophomore attacker Jess Scott started
the attack on the right foot with a goal at 33:01, but
the fate of the Cardinal was sealed when Notre
Dame came back to answer with five straight goals.
Despite Stanford's failure to keep Notre Dame
in check, the Cardinal kept up its aggressive play in
the last 10 minutes of the game, as Scott tallied an
other goal off of a free position and Britt followed
with her own free-position goal.
Sophomore defenders Katie Grube and Larissa
Conte were very strong on defense and refused to
let up.
"I felt as though our team played great defense,
with the attack denying goalie clears and really has
sling Notre Dame's defense out at their end,"

Grube said. "Our defense came through with some
really great double teams."
But the intense end to the game was not
enough to make up for its disappointing play up
to that point and the Cardinal was forced to walk
away wondering why it often turns up the intensi
ty too late.
"Unfortunately, our intensity and fire lacked
until the last five minutes of the game, and we
weren't able to capitalize on opportunities in the
midfield or offensive end," Grube said.
Although Stanford admits that it didn't give its
best performance Saturday, the Cardinal is unwill
ing to admit that it's incapable of playing better.
"[Head coach Michele Uhlfelder] thinks we're
better than we showed today," said sophomore at
tacker Tiffany Chao. "We just couldn't put the
things we know how to do together."
I'he Cardinal should profit from the short inter
mission it will have during finals week before it
travels to the hast Coast fora challenging Spring
Break tour.
On its three-game road trip, Stanford will face
Boston University, Vanderbilt (which the Cardinal
beat last year in a landmark victory for the pro
gram) and Brown.
"We have a lot of work to do before our next
game, but we have a long time to prepare," said
Britt. "This is the time when we need to stick to
gether as a team and work hard to improve on the
things that we had problems with yesterday be
cause we have some tough games ahead of us dur
ing Spring Break."
