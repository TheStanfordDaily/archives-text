# Synchro heads to college nationals
## SYNCHRO 
### ASHLEY ENSIGN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every Stanford student wants to end their quarter
on a high note, but for the Cardinal synchronized
swimming team, success doesn't necessarily just come
in the form of straight A's.
In addition to aceing their finals, the Stanford
women will also be looking for more top perfor
mances at Collegiate Nationals next week.
And success certainly isn't foreign to the Cardinal.
The synchro team traveled to Phoenix, Ariz, last
weekend to compete in the Senior West Zone Cham
pionships. Because this meet was not a collegiate
meet, Stanford faced the top competitors from the
club teams in the west. One hundred seventy-five ath
letes competed at the meet.
Many of the club teams at the meet were from Stan
ford swimmers' hometowns, including Walnut Creek,
San Diego and Riverside. Stanford athletes had to com
pete against old teammates and in front of old coaches.
"I was excited to see my old teammates and to see
their new routines," said sophomore Jennifer Kibler.
"However, when it was time for me to compete, all I
focused on was doing my best."
And Stanford did just that. The competition was
strong, but the Cardinal's performance was stellar as
usual, placing it in the top three for every event.
In the elements competition, Stanford sophomore
Katie Norris and senior Lindsey Wigginton both per

formed very strongly, placing first and second.
Freshman Sheila Sadovnik also had a great clay in
the elements competition, taking eighth place out of
the 175 competitors.
Next, in the solo competition, Norris captured first
place, and sophomore Erin Dobratz finished close be
hind in third place.
Dobratz does not usually swim solo for Stanford,
but by competing last weekend she qualified lor U.S.
Senior Nationals in April. Wigginton, Norris,
Sadovnik, and Kibler will also compete at U.S. Se
nior Nationals.
Only one of the two Stanford duets swam this
weekend. Junior Stephanie Joukofi''and Kibler had
one of their better swims and their routine scored sec
ond out of nearly 40 duets.
In the trio competition, none of the other com
petitors could touch Stanford. The trio of Wigginton,
Norris and Dobratz took first place while Joukofi, Ki
bler and Sadovnik finished close behind in second.
The third-place trio was a full two and a half points be
hind JoukofT, Kibler, and Sadovnik.
The competition culminated with the team event.
Again, Stanford had a great swim and the judges
agreed, placing the team first.
"This was a really great meet to prepare for Colle
giate Nationals," said senior Lindsey Wigginton. "It
was also good to expose college-bound club athletes to
