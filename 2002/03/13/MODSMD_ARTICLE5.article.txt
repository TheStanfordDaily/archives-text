# Aid recipients must register early
## Changes to Axess require students to enroll by end of previous quarter 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
To receive financial aid by the be
ginning of spring quarter, under
graduate and graduate students
need to enroll in classes for the spring
by March 22. This new policy is a re
sult of changes made to Axess, which
no longer uses the registration com
mitment system as proof that stu
dents attend the University.
Federal aid regulations require

that universities provide proof that
students are enrolled before any
money is distributed. Stanford uses
the same policy for aid coming from
private sources.
In the past, the University had stu
dents file commitment forms ensur
ing their attendance for the upcom
ing quarter.
Axess now operates on new soft
ware, People Soft, which does not
support the commitment system
Stanford previously used.
"The commitment system was to
tally unique to Stanford," Registrar
Roger Printup said. "Now we're buy
ing into the way most other colleges
and universities operate."
Under the new system, students

must enroll in courses to serve as
proof of attendance. The University
will not distribute aid to students
until they have submitted their
study lists.
When this change was announced
last fall, students expressed concern
about the effects such a policy would
have on the shopping period for classes
and the repercussions of not enrolling
on time. Printup stressed, however, that
this shift does not mean students must
predetermine their entire schedule.
"It doesn't mean you can't change
your mind," Printup said. "What I tell
students is, 'If you know some of the
classes you're taking, sign up for [them]
now. You know you're going to
take it.'"
As before, students will be able
to change their schedules until
the usual drop and add dead
lines. Printup stressed that sign
ing up in advance should be es
pecially easy for upperclassmen
fulfilling major requirements.
The change also does not man
date that students pre-enroll in
the 12 units necessary to be con
sidered a full-time student.
"You just need to be enrolled
in some classes," Printup said.
To notify students of the poli
cy change, the Registrar's Office
sent a campus-wide e-mail on
March 1, detailing the changes
and explaining what students
who receive aid need to do under

the new system.
The last day to enroll for fi
nancial aid was also noted on the
front cover of the Time Schedule.
Printup said that enrolling by
March 22 is essential mainly for
graduate students who rely on
the money from refund checks to
pay for other living expenses.
"If you're not fixated on hav
ing a refund that very first week,
it's less necessary," Printup said.
Students receive refund
checks when the amount of
money sent to the University for
their aid exceeds the amount
Stanford charges.
For students on aid who enroll
in courses after March 22, the
University will distribute refund
or stipend checks approximately
one week after they submit their
study lists, according to the e
mail. Students will need to pre
enroll in classes before each quar
ter as long as this system remains

in place to receive their aid at the
same time they did under the
registration commitment system.
To ensure that incoming
freshmen receive aid on time, the
University automatically enrolls
freshmen in generic Introduc
tion to Humanities and Program
in Writing and Rhetoric courses.
According to Printup, the
change has prompted some stu
dents to submit their study lists
earlier than normal.
"1 haven't looked at real hard
data, but we've noticed more ac
tivity this quarter than in faJl and
winter quarter at this time,"
Printup said.
Aware of what the new system
requires, students aren't fretting
too much about the change.
"I have other, more pressing
things to do before break,"
sophomore Christine Olivas said.
"I plan on looking at it before I go
on break."
