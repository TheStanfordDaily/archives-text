# Aid recipients must register early
## Changes to Axess require students to enroll by end of previous quarter 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
To receive financial aid by the be
ginning of spring quarter, under
graduate and graduate students
need to enroll in classes for the spring
by March 22. This new policy is a re
sult of changes made to Axess, which
no longer uses the registration com
mitment system as proof that stu
dents attend the University.
Federal aid regulations require

that universities provide proof that
students are enrolled before any
money is distributed. Stanford uses
the same policy for aid coming from
private sources.
In the past, the University had stu
dents file commitment forms ensur
ing their attendance for the upcom
ing quarter.
Axess now operates on new soft
ware, People Soft, which does not
support the commitment system
Stanford previously used.
"The commitment system was to
tally unique to Stanford," Registrar
Roger Printup said. "Now we're buy
ing into the way most other colleges
and universities operate."
Under the new system, students

must enroll in courses to serve as
proof of attendance. The University
will not distribute aid to students
until they have submitted their
study lists.
When this change was announced
last fall, students expressed concern
about the effects such a policy would
have on the shopping period for classes
and the repercussions of not enrolling
on time. Printup stressed, however, that
this shift does not mean students must
predetermine their entire schedule.
"It doesn't mean you can't change
your mind," Printup said. "What I tell
students is, 'If you know some of the
classes you're taking, sign up for [them]
