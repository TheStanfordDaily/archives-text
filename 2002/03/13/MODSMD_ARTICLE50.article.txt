# Fleshman wins race, track does well
## Junior captures 3,000- meter title at NCAA Indoor Championships 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
The lack of depth in the sprints, throws
and jumps doesn't seem to bother the Car
dinal track team too much.
With only six athletes competing, and all
but one of them in the distance events, the
Stanford women captured fifth place at die
NCAA Indoor Track and Field Champi
onships, held Friday and Saturday at the
University of Arkansas.
Every member of the women's squad
returned to the Farm as an Ail-American,
each having contributed points to the
team's total of 25.
Junior Lauren Fleshman led the
women by claiming the NCAA indoor tide
in the 3,000 meters, covering die distance
in 9:07.45.
I*he decision by Fleshman to sit out the
mile, for which she also qualified, obvious
ly paid off, as her 3,000-meter time broke
the stadium record.
Fleshman sat near the back of the
pack for most of the 15-lap race before
kicking into gear and overtaking the rest
of the field.

"I was just trying to do what my coach
told me, which was to make it a 10-lap run
and a five-lap race," Fleshman said. " The
pack was really tight, and there was a lot of
jostling and shoving. With five laps to go I
saw a small opening and made my move."
The same finishing kick diat gained
Fleshman the outdoor 5,000-meter cham
pionship last year propelled her into the
lead on the last lap and across the line for
the win, making this her second NCAA in
dividual title.
Fhe task of representing the Cardinal in
the mile was left to junior Malindi Elmore,
who delivered a fourth-place finish in a
time of 4:41.05, adding five points to the
team total.
Director of track and field Vin Lananna
was thrilled with the strong culmination of
the indoor season and has high expecta
tions of his squad in outdoors.
"I can't ask fora better meet on the
women's side," Lananna said. "I am
thrilled with the trends set for the outdoor
season. I expect the women to batde for the
[Pacific 10 Conference] Championship
and make a run at the NCAA Outdoor
Championships in Baton Rouge."
Sophomore Jillian Camarena, the only
Cardinal thrower at the Championships,
continued her streak of consistendy high
marks with a fifth-place dirow of 16.46 me
ters in the shot put.
Capping off die team's successful stay in

Arkansas, the women's distance medley
team, consisting of Fleshman, junior Lind
say Hyatt, senior Maurica Carlucci and
freshman Christine Moschella, placed
third with a time of 11:09.13.
The Cardinal men did not fare as well,
scoring six points and placing 35di.
Sophomore Grant Robison turned in
the highest individual finish for the Cardi
nal, placing sixth in the 3,000 meters in a
time of 8:04.82. Sophomore Chris Emme
followed in 14th (8:09.22) and junior Seth
Hejny took 16th (8:11.51). Robison and
Emme both took home Ail-American hon
ors for their performances.
Emme also competed in the 5,000 me
ters, where he placed 11th (14:15.20) be
hind junior Louis Luchini, who scored one
point for the Cardinal with his eighth-place
finish (14:11.15).
Sophomore Don Sage, who won his
preliminary heat of the mile, placed
11th in the finals in an uncharacteristic
time of 4:13.55.
The men's distance medley team, con
sisting of Sage, Hejny, Robison and fresh
man Curtis Goehring, was seeded seventh
heading into the race, and placed exactly
that in a time 0f9:35.30.
With the experience of the 2002 indoor
season behind them, the Cardinal athletes
begin preparation lor the outdoor season,
which kicks oil' with the Stanford Invita
tional, held from March 29 to March 30.

I*he decision by Fleshman to sit out the
mile, for which she also qualified, obvious
ly paid off, as her 3,000-meter time broke
the stadium record.
Fleshman sat near the back of the
pack for most of the 15-lap race before
kicking into gear and overtaking the rest
of the field.

"I was just trying to do what my coach
told me, which was to make it a 10-lap run
and a five-lap race," Fleshman said. " The
pack was really tight, and there was a lot of
jostling and shoving. With five laps to go I
saw a small opening and made my move."
The same finishing kick diat gained
Fleshman the outdoor 5,000-meter cham
pionship last year propelled her into the
lead on the last lap and across the line for
the win, making this her second NCAA in
dividual title.
Fhe task of representing the Cardinal in
the mile was left to junior Malindi Elmore,
who delivered a fourth-place finish in a
time of 4:41.05, adding five points to the
team total.
Director of track and field Vin Lananna
was thrilled with the strong culmination of
the indoor season and has high expecta
tions of his squad in outdoors.
"I can't ask fora better meet on the
women's side," Lananna said. "I am
thrilled with the trends set for the outdoor
season. I expect the women to batde for the
[Pacific 10 Conference] Championship
and make a run at the NCAA Outdoor
Championships in Baton Rouge."
Sophomore Jillian Camarena, the only
Cardinal thrower at the Championships,
continued her streak of consistendy high
marks with a fifth-place dirow of 16.46 me
ters in the shot put.
Capping off die team's successful stay in

Arkansas, the women's distance medley
team, consisting of Fleshman, junior Lind
say Hyatt, senior Maurica Carlucci and
freshman Christine Moschella, placed
third with a time of 11:09.13.
The Cardinal men did not fare as well,
scoring six points and placing 35di.
Sophomore Grant Robison turned in
the highest individual finish for the Cardi
nal, placing sixth in the 3,000 meters in a
time of 8:04.82. Sophomore Chris Emme
followed in 14th (8:09.22) and junior Seth
Hejny took 16th (8:11.51). Robison and
Emme both took home Ail-American hon
ors for their performances.
Emme also competed in the 5,000 me
ters, where he placed 11th (14:15.20) be
hind junior Louis Luchini, who scored one
point for the Cardinal with his eighth-place
finish (14:11.15).
Sophomore Don Sage, who won his
preliminary heat of the mile, placed
11th in the finals in an uncharacteristic
time of 4:13.55.
The men's distance medley team, con
sisting of Sage, Hejny, Robison and fresh
man Curtis Goehring, was seeded seventh
heading into the race, and placed exactly
that in a time 0f9:35.30.
