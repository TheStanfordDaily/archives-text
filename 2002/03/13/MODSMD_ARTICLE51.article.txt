# Core of seniors leave their mark
## Cardinal gymnastics is a lot more than hugs and smiles 
### SARAH LINDSEY STAFF WRITER 
As I sat through my first gym
nastics meet in January, one re
curring question kept passing
through my mind: what the heck
is going on?
To help speed up my under
standing of the sport, head coach
Kristen Smyth set up a meeting
with me and assistant coach
Larissa Fontaine so that I could
be informed of everything that I
didn't know about gymnastics.
That meeting lasted quite a
while.
After growing up watching
basketball, football, tennis and
baseball, watching Stanford
compete in gymnastics made me
feel like I did after my last math
midterm: completely and utter
ly lost.
Take, for example, what hap
pens after the meet is over. After
the scores are announced and
the top performers are recog
nized, girls from both teams go
over and hug members of the
other teams.
Sure, I have seen teams shake
hands after games, but hugging?
This seemed like the ultimate
sin, like Mike Krzyzewski eating
dinner with Gary Williams and
paying for the meal, too. It just
shouldn't be done.
And the actual competition
provided me with several more
unsolved mysteries.
First of all, how could these
tiny women exhibit such
strength and dedication? At
times they make even the football
team look lazy. The definition in
their biceps could put Casey Ja
cobsen to shame.

In addition, I couldn't under
stand how such an individualized
sport could be so team oriented.
However, these abnormalities
and quirks of gymnastics are
what makes it such an exciting
and fun sport to watch.
One of the amazing things
that I noticed at my first Stanford
gymnastics meet was how sup
portive the girls were of one an
other. They cheered for each
member throughout each and
every routine.
Perhaps this is why gymnas
tics is a team sport. And perhaps
this is why Stanford is ranked so
high nationally. The Cardinal is
truly unique in that it is such a
supportive and encouraging
team. In watching most of the
Cardinal's opponents during
meets, it seems like the women
on the visiting team might as
well be sitting on their hands
while their teammates are per
forming.
As I came to know the team
better, I also came to realize how
important the seniors were to
this delicate unity.
After meeting these girls one
on-one and seeing their person
alities out of the gym, I came to
better appreciate the dynamic
they bring to the gym.
Katy Herbert's liveliness and
encouragement help keep the
team's excitement level high,
while Kristin Jensen's serious
ness and intensity bring stability
to the team.
And Becky Meldrum's energy
and enthusiasm pull the team
through any slumps.
The underclassmen and
coaches got a chance to honor
these three seniors' contribu
tions to the team in their last
meet at Burnham Pavilion last
Friday.
"I want to thank the coaches
and the team for all the little
things they did to make the night

unforgettable," Meldrum said.
The memory of the night was
made complete as No. 8 Stanford
(9-3, 5-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
stomped Seattle Pacific (3-9),
195.800-192.450.
The seniors left their mark at
Burnham on Senior Night with
Meldrum and Jensen tying for
first place on the bars with an in
credible 9.950 and Herbert win
ning the all-around title with a
season-high score of 39.200.
"The seniors are really the
core of our team," said sopho
more Shelly Goldberg. "Their
dedication to the team inspires
us all."
However, the rest of the team
did more than its share en route
to the Cardinal's victory, with the
team winning all four events and
sweeping the vault and bars with
the top five scores in each event.
With this dominating win
under their belts, Stanford faces
another major obstacle in the
Pac-10 Championships.
"A big team struggle for the
Pac-10 will staying focused at
workout despite enduring the
pressure of finals week," said ju
nior Alissa Cooper.
However, the Cardinal will
have the advantage of competing
at Stanford in front of a home
crowd.
The Pac-10 Championships,
to be held in Maples Pavilion on
March 23, will give all the Cardi
nal fans one last chance to cheer
for the Stanford gymnastics
team.
Just as I have come to appre
ciate the quirks of the team and
the sport, I'd be willing to
wager that you would be
amazed as Lindsay Wing cata
pults off the vault or Becky Mel
drum takes death into her own
hands as she twists and flips on
the narrow beam.
And I bet by the end you
would appreciate t he hugs too.
