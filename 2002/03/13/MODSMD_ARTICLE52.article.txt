# Men's gymnastics pulls upset over Oklahoma
## Stanford clinches win in final event as head coach Hamada bids good-bye to the Farm 
### NEMIL DALAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mere hours were all that remained fora slew
of Cardinal talent, as the men's gymnastics
team facetl Oklahoma in head coach Sadao
Hamada's final home meet. Despite the Soon
ers' No. 2 ranking, the team gave Hamada and
his seniors an unforgettable closing to their
final meet at Burnham Pavilion.
But, making one final stand, the seniors -
with some underclass help - were able to outlast
the Sooners 214.700-214.550, as they finished
their regular season with their ninth victory
and highest score of the season.
In many respects, Saturday night was an
ending. An ending of the 30-year storied ca
reer of Sadao Hamada. An ending of the home
seasons of seniors Rico Andrade, Jason Blitz,
Justin Berkman, Dave Durante, David Ludlow
and Cade Raggio. An ending of the 2002 reg

ular season.
Breaking out of a deep slumber, Stanford
(9-9) showed that it could compete with the
best teams - Oklahoma was top-ranked in the
country last week - and suddenly seemed alive,
well and in control, just a week after being
soundly beaten by the Sooners.
Several names highlighted Saturday's com
petition. Ranked No.l in the country on rings,
junior Marshall Erwin did his part, garnering a
9.950 in the event for the third time this season.
An important member of this team, senior co
captain Dave Durante was on top in the all
around with a 53.750, as he turned in strong
performances on both bar events. He was as
sisted by sophomore Dan Gill's 9.550 on the
vault, which earned Gill first place in the event
Yet, what made this meet different from the
Cardinal's other competitions of the season was
the strong performances by the other members
of the team. Cade Raggio, hitherto unknown in
the box stores this season, came from nowhere,
claiming second plat e on the vault and a pair of
third plat es on the floor anil horizontal bars.
Junior Paul O'Leary followed Raggio's path,
snagging a sizzling 9.5(H) with his routine on one of
the Cardinals' weakest events, the parallel bars.

And the gutsiest performance of the night had to
be senior Jason Blitz's 8.500 on the pommel horse,
as he was coining back from a stress fracture.
"This meet proved that gymnastics is a team
sport," said senior co-captain Rico Andrade,
who notched a third place on the floor exer
cise. "Everybody seemed to have a clutch per
formance. [But] my MVP votes goes to Blitz.
He's still in a lot of pain from his stress frac
tures, and he still hit his routine."
With many alumni in town, some from the
early '70s, Hamada must have had bittersweet
feelings about his career coming to an end.
"[Hamada's] commitment to excellence
through creativity and innovation is some
thing I live by everyday," commented
Olympic silver medalist Jair Lynch, a former
gymnast of Hamada's. "I lis ability to develop
and execute a poised strategy for any situation
short-or long-term is masterful."
Andrade added, "We couldn't have scripted
Sadao's last meet any better. This was the gym
nastics equivalent of a buzzer-beater."
1 lamada's long-term strategy will be further
tested in the upcoming Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation championships in a little
more than a week.
