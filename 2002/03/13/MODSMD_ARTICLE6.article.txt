# CEO of BP discusses efforts to make oil more environmentally friendly
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
John Browne, CEO of British Petroleum, addressed
professors, students, industry leaders and media Monday
night at the Graduate School of Business in a speech titled,
"Beyond Petroleum: Business and the Environment in the

21st Century."
Browne prefaced the speech by describing climate
change as "an issue which raises fundamental questions
about the relationship between companies and society as a
whole, and between one generation and the next.... an
issue which is about leadership as well as science."
Browne announced that BP had already achieved its
pledge made four years ago at Stanford, "to reduce green
house gases by 10 percent from a 1990 baseline by the
year 2010."
Browne attributed this achievement to the "efficiency
and technology" of the BP team.
The target was met at "no net economic cost," Browne
said. "That's a particularly noteworthy point, because it be
gins to answer the fears expressed by those who believed
that the costs of taking precautionary action would be huge
and unsustainable," Browne said.
The significance of this point was affirmed after the
speech by Biology Prof. Chris Field and Stephen Schneider,
a professor of biological sciences and civil and environment
engineering and a senior fellow at the Institute for Interna
tional Studies.
"The fact that cuts in emissions did not entail costs shows
that there is a lot to gain in efficiency and good management
before looking to new strategies," Field said.
Bruce McKern, director of the Business School s Sloan


The Stanford Daily
Program, of which Browne is a
graduate, echoed this sentiment,
saying that the fact that BP in
curred no net cost is "very pro
found."
"We often feel environmental
steps are going to be costly to com
panies and subsequently to con
sumers," McKern said.
Although Browne was pleased
with the early achievement of BP's
goal, he expressed a need for con
tinued progression.
"[BP's new goal is] to hold the
emissions of our operations at 10
percent below 1990 levels, [while]
continuing to grow our produc
tion of oil and gas by more than 5
percent per annum."
Browne went on to explain two
ways to help realize that goal.
"[We realize the goal first by]
improving the productivity of the
energy we use and doing every
thing we can internally to reduce
our emissions per unit of produc
tion," Browne said.
"Secondly, we have to continue
to reduce the carbon content of
the products we produce and sell.
We'll continue to shift the balance
of our business in favor of lower
carbon energy sources and in par
ticular natural gases."
Browne also said that BP will
continue to develop its solar
business and explore other po
tential renewable sources of sup
ply, like hydrogen, as well as in
creasing carbon uptake back into
the environment.

Browne stressed a need fora
system of credits, which would
provide incentives for innovation.
Both Schneider and Field ex
pressed concern that even though
BP's new goal is very positive, it
will take a lot more than the efforts
of one company to solve the prob
lems of climate change.
"Even if we fully implement
[the] Kyoto [Protocol] and it
proves as successful as BP's efforts,
that will not be nearly enough to
prevent carbon dioxide from
more than doubling in the 21st
Century unless we have much
larger cuts in emissions below
most projections," Schneider said.
However, there is hope.
"This is a manageable prob
lem," Browne said. "We've made a
start, and now we're going to take
another step."
Browne said the energy indus
try, automakers, academia and
governments need to work togeth
er to tackle the interdisciplinary
problem of climate change.
"Acting together, we can rein
vent the energy business," Browne
said.
Browne closed on an optimistic
note.
"People expect successful com
panies to take on challenges, to
apply skills and technology and to
give them better choices," Browne
said. "We do accept the challenge.
[The challenge is] to reinvent the
energy business, to stabilize our
emissions, and, in doing so, to
make a contribution to the chal
lenge facing the world."
"We are very fortunate to have
leaders with vision and foresight
like John Browne," Field said.

Browne went on to explain two
ways to help realize that goal.
"[We realize the goal first by]
improving the productivity of the
energy we use and doing every
thing we can internally to reduce
our emissions per unit of produc
tion," Browne said.
"Secondly, we have to continue
to reduce the carbon content of
the products we produce and sell.
We'll continue to shift the balance
of our business in favor of lower
carbon energy sources and in par
ticular natural gases."
Browne also said that BP will
continue to develop its solar
business and explore other po
tential renewable sources of sup
ply, like hydrogen, as well as in
creasing carbon uptake back into
the environment.

Browne stressed a need fora
system of credits, which would
provide incentives for innovation.
Both Schneider and Field ex
pressed concern that even though
BP's new goal is very positive, it
will take a lot more than the efforts
of one company to solve the prob
lems of climate change.
"Even if we fully implement
[the] Kyoto [Protocol] and it
proves as successful as BP's efforts,
that will not be nearly enough to
prevent carbon dioxide from
more than doubling in the 21st
Century unless we have much
larger cuts in emissions below
most projections," Schneider said.
However, there is hope.
"This is a manageable prob
lem," Browne said. "We've made a
start, and now we're going to take
another step."
Browne said the energy indus
try, automakers, academia and
governments need to work togeth
er to tackle the interdisciplinary
problem of climate change.
"Acting together, we can rein
vent the energy business," Browne
said.
Browne closed on an optimistic
note.
"People expect successful com
panies to take on challenges, to
apply skills and technology and to
give them better choices," Browne
said. "We do accept the challenge.
[The challenge is] to reinvent the
energy business, to stabilize our
emissions, and, in doing so, to
make a contribution to the chal
lenge facing the world."
"We are very fortunate to have
leaders with vision and foresight
like John Browne," Field said.
