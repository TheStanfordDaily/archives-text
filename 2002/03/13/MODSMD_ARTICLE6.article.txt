John Browne, CEO of British Petroleum, addressed
professors, students, industry leaders and media Monday
night at the Graduate School of Business in a speech titled,
"Beyond Petroleum: Business and the Environment in the

21st Century."
Browne prefaced the speech by describing climate
change as "an issue which raises fundamental questions
about the relationship between companies and society as a
whole, and between one generation and the next.... an
issue which is about leadership as well as science."
Browne announced that BP had already achieved its
pledge made four years ago at Stanford, "to reduce green
house gases by 10 percent from a 1990 baseline by the
year 2010."
Browne attributed this achievement to the "efficiency
and technology" of the BP team.
The target was met at "no net economic cost," Browne
said. "That's a particularly noteworthy point, because it be
gins to answer the fears expressed by those who believed
that the costs of taking precautionary action would be huge
and unsustainable," Browne said.
The significance of this point was affirmed after the
speech by Biology Prof. Chris Field and Stephen Schneider,
a professor of biological sciences and civil and environment
engineering and a senior fellow at the Institute for Interna
tional Studies.
"The fact that cuts in emissions did not entail costs shows
that there is a lot to gain in efficiency and good management
before looking to new strategies," Field said.
