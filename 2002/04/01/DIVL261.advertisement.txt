Images of Women in French Cinema
Professor Jean-Marie Apostolides
Spring Quarter 2002
Grounded in a sociological analysis of French society and
on feminist film theories, the course will be both theoretical
and practical. It is taught by Jean-Marie Apostolides and
fulfills two general requirements:
• 3a-Humanities
• 4C-Gender Studies.
The course's three objectives are:
• To define the "mythological image of woman"
• To trace the evolution of this myth over a fifty-year
period of French cinema
• To follow this evolution by insisting on two precise
topics: that of the family and that of the couple.
