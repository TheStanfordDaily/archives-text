"Computers and Interfaces" this spring will enable students to
develop their skills in interdisciplinary teams to imagine and
create unique ICT solutions that empower developing world
communities.*
Have the opportunity to participate in a unique cross-cultural
experience that will bring together the academic, NGO,
government and corporate sectors.
Final projects will be judged by fellows from Reuters, various
NGO's, Philips Electronics, industrial associates of CSLI, and
others. Prizes will be awarded for the best projects and external
opportunities created for follow-up
Who knows, you may even get the opportunity to travel to the
community for which you developed your project!
*Note: The class will be offering a choice in final design projects. The other
project involves work with Motorola in designing a device/interface for
"information everywhere."
