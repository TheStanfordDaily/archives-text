# Snoring, osteoporosis and the T-Rex
## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Know a snorer? Are yon one yourself? Fake
note: snoring happens when a part of the throat
flutters when we inhale or exhale during sleep. By
itself, snoring does not cause any health problems.
However, snoring is often a symptom of sleep
apnea, which means there is a break or pause in
breathing during sleep. Apnea can be dangerous,
since it lowers oxygen in the bloodstream.
Researchers at University of Michigan have also
found a strong correlation between snoring and at
tention deficit in children: those who snore are
twice as likely to be hyperactive than sound sleep
ers. fhe link was especially pronounced for boys
under eight years of age, where almost one-third of
snorers had high scores of hyperactivity.
Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass,
leading to brittle bones and increased risk of frac
ture. It usually affects those over 50, and especially
women. The National Osteoporosis Foundation es
timates that 44 million American women are at risk.
Treatment relies on a drug called Fosamax,
which increase bone density but can have side ef
fects such as nausea and abdominal pain. Recently
a related drug called Zometa has shown similar re
sults without side effects, except that one in 10
cases may have flu-like symptoms fora few hours.
Meanwhile, the best medicine is prevention. A
diet rich in calcium, especially in the younger years,
drastically reduces the risk of osteoporosis.
Remember the scene of the T-Rex running after
the jeep in "Jurassic Park"? Well, even if we cloned
dinosaurs, that would never happen.
A study published early March suggests that
Tyrannosaurus Rex is not the speedster we think it
to be. The authors think the animal was too massive
to sprint, relying instead on a keen sense of smell.
This is the latest in a series of revisions that
included correcting the T-Rex's posture.
Most paleontologists agree the T-Rex did not
walk upright. Instead it knelt low and for
ward, with the tail in the air and weight on its
hips to maintain stability.

One typically learns in high school that matter
exists in three forms: solid, liquid and gas. Howev

er, one often discovers at university-level courses
(hat the classification also includes plasma and
Bose-Einstein condensate.
Plasma occurs at very high temperatures when
gases become ionized. This rarely happens on
Earth, mostly within fluorescent and neon lights.
But plasma actually comprises 99 percent of matter
in the universe.
Meanwhile, condensate happens at very low
temperatures when solids become essentially im
mobile. Atoms do not have a definite location but
instead become "smeared" into a "superfluid."
BEC was first produced in laboratory in 1995. Its
potential applications are numerous, ranging from
superconductors to quantum computers.
Did we originate from interstellar dust particles?
The origin of life on Earth is still a mystery. One
theory suggests that our origin is extraterrestrial.
Scientists have already found evidence ofwater and
amino acids in meteorites, and NASA recendy an
nounced discovered that they contain sugar.
1 he researchers believe simple sugars may have
formed when starlight bombarded clouds of dust
floating between stars. Asteroids then took care of
transporting them to the solar system. Most scien
tists agree that life needs three key ingredients:
water, amino acids (proteins that provide structure)
and sugars (carbohydrates that provide energy).
The prevailing theory says that organic mole
cules spontaneously formed in a sea of minerals
and developed self-reproduction mechanisms.
During the past fifty years, doctors have been re
evaluating traditional medical systems. The Indian
ayurveda, for example, seeks good health through
food and lifestyle choices. The All India Institute of
Medical Sciences conducted a randomized trial in
1999 and found that ayurvedic remedies alleviated
side effects of chemotherapy.
Another example is Chinese acupuncture that
tries to stimulate energy points in the body to im
prove health. Modern medicine has often been
skeptic of acupuncture, but a study now suggests it
may have true benefits. Australia's Adelaide Uni
versity evaluated the effects of acupuncture on 600
women suffering from morning sickness, and dis
covered that a weekly 20-minute session during a
month's time reduced the symptoms of nausea
and vomiting.
