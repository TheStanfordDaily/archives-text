## DANCING IN CIRCLES Can we learn about life? 
### 
What do you think it's like to be
old? When we think about
retirement, we tend to won
der whether we will have
enough to eat, whether we will have peo
ple to take care of us, whether we will live
active 01 passive lives. But what about the
time between now and then? What will we
do with ourselves, and what will we look
back on when we become the ones to
pinch our grandkids' cheeks and worry
that they are not eating enough?
I spent an afternoon with my grand-

mother last week, and
along with the usual
speech about how won
derful it is to be born in
America, Land of Op
portunity, she asked
what I was thinking
about doing after gradu
ation. She said, I wish I
could be 20 again but re-

tain the knowledge I have at 86.
Intrigued, 1 asked what she'd do differ
ently if she were my age. The answer was
along the lines of she would never get mar
ried, she'd go to college, make some dif
ferent choices along the way. But really, I
think she knew it was futile to try and tell
to me how to live a good life. I just
wouldn't understand.
I know lots of people who have a list of
things they want to do by the time they're
30. Go to graduate school, backpack
through Europe, start a family, all sorts of
exciting goals. I want to make my own list,
but where can I learn how to fill it? How
can I avoid all the traps that prevent peo
ple from checking off items on those lists?
As they say, we need to study our histo
ry so as not to repeat it. And also, I think,
so as to learn what is the good stuff in life,
and try to do as much of that stuff as possi
ble. Education takes a crack at the task of
teaching us human history, at least, select
parts of it.
To bring even one person up to speed
on the experiences of the past takes 18,22,
or 27 years of schooling. But really, in a
whole lifetime we cannot learn from all the
mistakes and joys of our ancestors.
And even if we could read about all the
actions of all the great leaders in our past,
even if we could know what went on in the
daily lives of all the billions of common
people that went before us, I don't know
that we would understand. It's one thing
to look at events and try to synthesize
trends and causation. It's quite another to
wrap your brain around the conscious ex
periences of each of the people who lived
through those times. To understand what
exactly which paths lead to happiness, and
which to dead ends.
Heck, we can't even understand our
own lives, and we are living them in full,
unabridged form. Learning history is like

watching a movie preview in fast-forward:
you get only the highlights, and you know
how it's going to end before you even
watch. There's no way we can compre
hend the intricate desires and feelings of
all the folks represented by each para
graph in the history books.
Arid really, how can we even know the
consciousness of our contemporaries? I
can't understand the life of a subsistence
farmer in China. I can't experience the
emotions of a postal worker in Denver,
tired and frustrated at a growing line of
complaining customers. I can describe
them, sure. But to know them is a differ
ent story.
I can't even know you. Yeah, you. We
walk the same campus every day and
we've probably seen each other 20 times
biking around the Main Quad. But I
have absolutely no clue what you do and
who you love, let alone what goes on in
your head.
It's as though each of us inhabits our
own sphere, a bubble of consciousness
and experience that we alone have access
to. We roll around and bump into each
other, sometimes bouncing off and some
times sticking together fora while. It's
like a big McDonaldland playpen full of
colorful balls, shifting in relation to each
other and perhaps losing their shape, but
in the end maintaining their status as sep
arate objects.
And it's not just the strangers on the
bikes we can't know. Even with our friends
and our lovers, we may be connected fora
while, but in time people change. What we
think is right today may be wrong tomor
row, and the process of that transforma
tion is a very private one.
So is it all an illusion, the idea that we
can be close to one another? That we can
learn from each other's experience? Are
we destined to be lonely creatures, blind
ly creating our own paths? 1 don't see that
there's anyone out there who can teach me
everything about life. I just take bits and
pieces from different people, and hopeful
ly they'll fit together.
When I think of grandparents, I see
them as though they have always been old.
They have always had this wisdom, this ex
perience from which they tell tales time
and again. But no, they too have wound
their way through the path of life, never
knowing which way to turn. They have
fumbled, and probably are still fumbling,
to understand how to fill the role society
has given them at each age.
Maybe there is no path. We just look
back and want so badly to see some logic in
our lives that our brain puts one together.
