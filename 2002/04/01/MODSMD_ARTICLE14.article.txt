Alum disappointed with Law School
The following is an open letter to Pro
fessor Kathleen M. Sullivan, Dean of the
School of Law.
As an alumnus of Stanford Law School,
I am disappointed and embarrassed for
the Law School and the University at your
reported joining of the legal team which
will seek to invalidate the recently passed
campaign finance reform law.
Your teammates' position could could
easily be predicted. Kenneth Starr is a
faithful servant of the right and of its faith
in the benefits of big money in politics.
And Floyd Abrams is a loyal defender of
extremist positions on behalf of the First
Amendment's freedom of speech. I note
that nine former officials of the ACLU
have reputiated its and Mr. Abram's posi
tion in this matter. Perhaps they recog
nized, as we all should, that Barry Gold
water's notorious dictum, "Extremism in
the defense of liberty is no vice" is the issue
in this instance.
But for you as the dean, and necessari
ly the spokesperson fora prestigious, even
hallowed, public institution, Stanford Law
School, to attach that institution to such an
anti-democratic effort is lamentable.
And anti-democratic it is. Of course,
there has always been in theory some ten
sion between liberty and democracy, and
there are particular cases where the choice
may not be an easy one.
But when it comes to the corrupting,
insidious effect of big money on politics,
on the ordinary person's right to be and to
have his or her interests fully, faithfully
and equally represented, and on our
democracy itself— there is no legitimate
dispute.
I note Mr. Abrams' basically dishonest
complaint that the law assumes that
some form of political speech is too dan
gerous. Of course the problem is not the
content of the speech but its sponsorship
— the all-consuming tidal wave of big
money fostering its speech and drown
ing out the peoples'.
It may be debated whether democracy
sprang full-fledged from the forehead of
the Constitution, but certainly by the time
of, and ever since the time of Lincoln's
"Government of the people, by the people,
and for the people," the United States and
its people and its responsible institutions
have prided themselves first and foremost
on the democracy which the nation repre
sents. Every politician, every legislator, and
every president, perhaps particularly Pres
ident George W. Bush, speaks constantly
about the blessings of democracy and its
benefits at home and abroad.
As John Dewey, echoing past philoso
phers and political theorists, said — the
chief and sacred role of our liberties, and
the role of freedom of speech and press, is
as a crucial part of the machinery that al
lows a truly democratic public to operate.
It is a means to an end and must be mod
erated when, like the immune system run
amok, it threatens the end itself.
Our democracy is not only the object
of the reform law, but it's the mechanism
by which it came to pass. The Senate, by a
strong vote of 60 to 40, passed the cam
paign finance bill, the House of Repre
sentatives early passed it by an over
whelming vote, and Bush has signed it
into law. The public is overwhelmingly
behind it.
This is not some tactical tinkering where
the will of the people and its elected repre
sentatives can be a negligible factor. In the
Federalist Papers, No. 84, Alexander

Hamilton wrote apropos of "liberty of the
press": "I infer that its security... must alto
gether depend on the public opinion and
on the general spirit of the people...
The campaign finance reform law is, al
beit falling in an infinite line of imperfect
creations, nevertheless an absolutely es
sential and powerful step to preserve and
enhance the democratic nature of our sys
tem and of our government.
I urge you to re-think your participa
tion in the attack on it, and the inevitable
association of the University and the Law
School with this sad and tarnished effort.

Law School should support campaign
finance reform
I am saddened to learn that the Dean of
the Stanford Law School, Kathleen Sulli
van, will be joining Senator Mitch Mc-
Connell's (R-Ky.) lawsuit to overturn cam
paign finance reform. In the name of fair
ness fora few she will be turning her back
on millions for whom the system is des
perately unfair.
Because of the overwhelming influ
ence of campaign financing, Congress
this month rejected mileage standards for
the auto industry, even a distant 13 years
in the future. Because of campaign-pur
chased influence, millions remain unin
sured and beyond the reach of health
care, the lame have not public transporta
tion, and we do not harness the sun or
regulate Enron.
Because of campaign-purchased influ
ence, Congress will likely soon approve a
$48 billion increased war budget for items
that have no effect whatsoever against
plastic knives or box cutters.
It is disingenuous to offer that huge
campaign contributions are free speech.
A majority of Americans are excluded
from such speech precisely because it is
not free but is outrageously expensive.
This is gilded speech glorified by the
same interests that, 100 years ago, ar
gued that freedom of contract should
keep children in the mines and allow
women to work 18-hour days. The
wealthy claim that today's spending
practices are fair because they are avail
able to everyone. But influence in Amer
ica's elections is not available to everyone
because everyone is not wealthy.
Free speech is not the right to sing in
the wind; it is the right to speech which
matters. It is the right to approximately
equivalent participation in television be
cause TV ads are the currency and foun
dation of modern campaigns. It is the
right to regulated spending because
spending is the single most important fac
tor in winning elections. It is the right not
to be drowned out by a single social class.
It is the right of the family farmer to be
heard alongside agribusiness, the con
sumer to be heard alongside the steel ex
ecutive who wants to raise the tariffs on ap
pliances, the Palo Alto Times to be heard
alongside Rupert Murdoch's empire. It is
the right of all of us to hear from more
than one, dominant moneyed class. In
America today the poor and the hungry
have no possibility, none, to join the
$100,000 club or the Energy Advisory
Committee. Who at the Law School speaks
for them? Who, indeed, at Stanford at all?
To deny, as Sullivan must now do, the
connection between huge campaign con
tributions and favorable congressional
votes does not dignify her. Blindness is
not public service. It was one thing as

loyal Americans for us all to tolerate and
abide by the Florida presidential deci
sion; it is quite another for the dean ac
tively and energetically to abet the
Supreme Court to favor the voices of
privilege. This is a sad annoucement for
the Law School, for Stanford, and most
importantly, for the republic.

Censor Noam Chomsky
It was with much dismay that I came
across the table in White Plaza two weeks
ago selling tickets to a Noam Chomsky
speaking engagement to a long line of
eager paying attendees. Normally I would
not oppose a speaker for his views, but I
believe Chomsky to be a virulent offender
to his own cause and a dangerous manip
ulator of the impressionable.
Chomsky often argues that one's views
cannot be censored no matter how abhor
rent they may be. I concede I fell for this at
first. After all, what are we without free
speech? But it is the harmful manner in
which Chomsky applies this doctrine that
causes social destruction. Chomsky sup
ports the airing of claims of Holocaust de
niers and considers these "scholars" to be
"informed" and among his friends.
When commenting on an author who
referred to Jews as Nazis and accused Jews
of being evil and irreverent to all other re
ligions, Chomsky said, "[lsrael] Shahak is
an outstanding scholar, with remarkable
insight and depth of knowledge. His work
is informed and penetrating, a contribu
tion of great value."
Statements like this go along with
Chomsky's trademarked method of talk
ing through others' mouths. In 1981 he
was quoted as saying, "I see no anti-
Semitic implications in denial of the exis
tence of gas chambers, or even denial of
the Holocaust." Again, without necessarily
taking this stance, Chomsky gives some
credence to the atrocious claim of Holo
caust deniers.
Planting ideas in the minds of the im
pressionable that the Holocaust was
staged or simply a wartime measure and
that the 350,000 living survivors are bold
faced liars vying for attention by crying
bloody murder is almost as ghastly as the
events themselves.
It may seem un-American to suggest
censorship of misinformed ideas, but it is
not necessarily a horrid approach. What
should we do about anti-Arab rhetoric that
incites misunderstanding of religion and
culture? An all-too-gullible adolescent
hears "All Arabs are terrorists," and the
next thing we know that child is torching a
mosque the next morning thinking he or
she is being virtuous against evil. We don't
all have the mental capacity to realize
when we're being duped. Even if these as
sertions are later rebuked by another
speaker, the concept has been planted,
and like a virus, will spread to arouse hate,
mistrust and misunderstanding.
I imagine the attendees of Noam
Chomsky's lecture will be strong and
aware of fallacies he may put forth. How
ever, as students and faculty of this Uni
versity, we are often lauded for our open,
inquisitive minds. Be careful of the devi
ous rhetoric that comes at you from all di
rections. There's no shame in refusing to
support Chomsky with your presence
and wallet.
