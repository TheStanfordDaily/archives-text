RAM ALL AH, West Bank (AP) â€” Say
ing Israel is in a war for survival, Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to smash
Palestinian militants in an uncompromis
ing offensive, as he addressed a nation
rattled by five suicide bombings in five
days, including back-to-back attacks yes
terday that killed 15 Israelis.
In an expansion of Israel's "Opera
tion Protective Wall," dozens of Israeli
tanks entered the West Bank town of
Qalqiliya late yesterday, governor
Mustafa Malki said. Electricity was cut
off and exchanges of fire could be
heard. Armored vehicles also massed
near biblical Bethlehem.
In Ramallah, under Israeli control
since Friday, dozens of European peace
activists, their arms raised and holding
white flags, marched past Israeli sol
diers surrounding Yasser Arafat's office
to join the Palestinian leader, saying
they would stay with him as human
shields.

At least 20 Palestinians and two Israeli
soldiers had been killed in Ramallah
since Friday.
Late yesterday, witnesses and Pales
tinian officials said Israeli soldiers
opened fire on and killed five policeman
when the Palestinians tried to surrender
in Ramallah.
"We put our weapons at the main
entrance and started to walk out when
the Israelis fired on us," said a police
man at the building who would only
give his name as Omar. He said 17 po
lice remained in the building and the
standoff continued.
In a statement, the Israeli military said
"wanted men" were in the building and
one of them, wearing an explosives belt,
opened fire on them. The soldiers
chased him and shot him dead, the state
ment said.
Earlier in the day, Israeli forces sur
rounding Arafat's headquarters ex
changed fire with Arafat's guards, and

Palestinian officials said Araf at was just
a few yards from the fighting. Several
guards were wounded, two of them se
riously.
The Israeli army spokesman, Brig.
Gen. Ron Kitrey, acknowledged that
Arafat was at risk, even if he was not a tar
get.
Addressing the nation in a five-minute
televised speech, Sharon said Israel is
fighting a "war over our home" and
branded Arafat an enemy of the Jewish
state and the "entire free world," as well
as a danger to the Middle East.
"We must fight against this terrorism,
fight with no compromise, pull up these
wild plants by the roots, smash their in
frastructure, because there is no compro
mise with terrorism," Sharon said,
adding that only then a cease-fire would
be possible.
Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb
Erekat said the speech was "void of sub
stance, void of hope, void of realism."
