## March Sadness Jacobsen & Co. fall to Kansas 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
After Stanford's season came to
an end, head coach Mike Mont
gomery made two statements, one
regarding his personal choice fora
national champion, the other
about the future of his team.
The first?
"I really hope that Kansas wins
it all," Montgomery said, minutes
after the Cardinal's 86-63 loss to
the Jayhawks in front of 31,484 in
St. Louis. "Nobody is more deserv
ing than [Kansas coach] Roy
Williams. Nobody does a better job
than him."
He can cross that one off his list.
Williams and Kansas lost to Mary
land in the Final Four on Sunday.
The second statement ad
dressed the possible departure of
juniors Casey Jacobsen and Curtis
Borchardt.
"We are anticipating that they
will be back in a Cardinal uniform
and will get their degree," Mont
gomery said.

However, according to reports
from the San Jose Mercury News
on Sunday, Jacobsen is expected to
declare his eligibility for the NBA
draft within the next couple of
weeks. Jacobsen would still have
the option of withdrawing from
the draft in June as long as he does
not hire an agent.
Oh well. Montgomery is the
coach, not a fortune-teller.
And although the 16th-year
coach's first statement is simply
human interest, the latter could have
major implications for Stanford's
basketball program. Jacobsen is ex
pected to test N BA waters while Bor
chardt has yet to make a statement
about his future.
Stanford's offensive production
against Kansas was mostly generat
ed through Jacobsen and Bor
chardt, so if both players left, it
would be devastating to a Cardinal
team that managed to win 20
games this season despite losing
four starters.
"We were fortunate enough to
get second place in probably the
best conference in America and
make the tournament and get a
chance to play Kansas," said Jacob
sen, who scored a game-high 24
points against the Jayhawks to pass
Brevin Knight and take third place
on Stanford's career scoring list
with 1,723 points.
"That's a good season," said
Jacobsen.
But not a "sweet" or an "elite"
one. And the reason this time was be
cause of the top-seeded Jayhawks.
Even though Jacobsen and
Borchardt, who finished with 13
points and 11 rebounds and tal
lied his 17th double-double of the
season, put up significant num
bers against the Jayhawks, the en
tire Cardinal team struggled
from the start.
The beginning of the game was
like a bad dream: Five turnovers in
the first six possessions. No field
goals in the first eight. And while
Stanford struggled to get an open
jump shot, the Jayhawks scored
their first four field goals on easy

layups by forward Nick Collison
and center Drew Cooden.
Add a couple,free throws, a Col
lison juniper and a 3-pointer by se
nior guard Jeff Boschee, and the
Cardinal trailed, 15-0.
"Defensively they were all over
us," Borchardt said. "We couldn't
get open. We couldn't get the ball
entered. Offensively, they just at
tacked us. It happened so last."
Kansas then went on a 10-0 run
to end the half and led, 48-26
heading into the locker room.
"We felt that if we could stay
about 14 [points] down at the half,
we'd be okay, but that just didn't
happen," Montgomery said.
Instead, the Cardinal went 3 of
22 from behind the arc for the
game and only shot 28.6 percent
from the field in the first half.
The comparison to Stanford's 25-
point loss to Southern California in
the first round of the Pac-10 Tourna

ment was inevitable, but it had one
distinction. The defeat to the Trojans
was only a 30-minute trouncing. This
one lasted all 40 minutes.
To add insult to injury, Kansas
junior guard Kirk Hinrich, who
was doubtful after suffering a
sprained ankle against Holy
Cross two days before, finished
with 15 points, eight assists and
five rebounds.
"1 know Kirk, and I knew he
was going to try to play," Jacob
sen said. "He's tough. A player
with only one good leg played
with more heart than anybody
out there."
Boschee added a team-high 19
points, Gooden scored 15 and Col
lison won many of the battles in
side the key with 17 points and 13
rebounds.
Besides Jacobsen and Bor
chardt, no other Stanford player
scored more than eight points.

Stanford never got its footing, and after five Cardinal turnovers and zero field
goals in six possessions, Kansas sprinted to a 15-0 lead in its 23-point win.
