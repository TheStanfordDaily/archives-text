# Women stumble against Colorado
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT STAFF WRITER 
The Sweet 16 marked a bitter
sweet end to the Cardinal's come
back season.
The women's basketball team
reached the third round for the first
time since the 1996-97 season after
posting a strong 77-55 win over Tu
lane in its last home game of the
year, but was unable to advance fur
ther in the NCAA tournament.
Stanford met Colorado in the
West regional semifinal in a con
test that went down to the wire.
The Buffaloes pulled off the 62-59
upset after a grueling 40 minutes
of lead changes, errors, and two
last-ditch attempts by the Cardinal
to save the game.
Stanford entered the game hes
itantly, struggling to find an offen
sive rhythm. The Cardinal tried to
push the ball and match the small
er and quicker Colorado team, but
for all its efforts, produced an un
characteristic 11 turnovers in the
first half.
"We were trying to force too
much and we couldn't get into a
rhythm," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer.
Further compromising the al
ready floundering Stanford squad
were the frustrated first-half re
sults of offensive duo and leaders
Lindsey Yamasaki and Nicole
Powell.
Yamasaki appeared to have re
covered from her earlier appen
dectomy after her game-high 24
points against Tulane, but strug
gled to find her shot against Col
orado. The senior guard shot 1 of
6 in the first half before turning on
the heat in the second on her way
to a team-high 14 points.
Meanwhile, Powell had to con
tend with a swarming defense de
termined to contain her. After
notching two triple-doubles in as
many rounds of NCAA play, the
sophomore guard was clearly the
focus of the Buffalo defense. While
she still managed to put in 13
points of her own, her six
turnovers spoke volumes about
how Colorado managed to disrupt
both her and her teammates'
games.

"I think while I got going in the
second half, it might have been too
little, too late," Yamasaki said. "I
think the team depends a lot on
Nicole and I, and for us to start off
slow wasn't what our team needed
and it might have given our team
more confidence down the
stretch."
When the dust settled after the
first half, the score was tied at 27
and the Cardinal knew it needed a
new game plan.
Using its size advantage, Stan
ford slowed the tempo and forced
the Buffaloes into a physical inside
game. Such a strategy would have
worked, save for Colorado's clutch
17-of-19 shooting from the free
throw line.
Forward Tera Bjorklund led all
scorers with 17 points and 10 in
the second half, including a per
fect 9 of 9 from the charity stripe.
Colorado's leading scorer, for
ward Mandy Nightingale, was
held to just 5 points on the night,
well below her 20-plus average,
but the duo found a way to win by
going to the line.
The teams exchanged leads
down the stretch but no one could
put together a convincing run. A
Colorado bucket with 1:51 re
maining increased its lead to 60-
56. Powell responded on her end
of the court, draining a long-range
three-pointer with 1:32 left on the
clock.
The Cardinal had a chance for
the win after a steal by senior cen
ter Bethany Donaphin, whose
heroic efforts shouldn't be ig
nored. The center scored 13
points and worked hard on the de
fensive end, finishing with two
blocks and eight rebounds. Her
biggest moment came with just
over 30 seconds left in the game
when Colorado attempted to lob
the ball inside and threw it right
into Donaphin's hands.
The steal gave Stanford the op
portunity to take a clean lead, but
the lack of experience in tight situ
ations seemed to take its toll, as the
team pushed through a hurried
offensive series that resulted in a
turnover under the bucket instead

Colorado's defense focused on sophomore guard Nicole Powell, who still
managed 13 points and 9 rebounds in Stanford's 62-59 tournament loss.
of a basket itself.
The Cardinal immediately
fouled and sent sophomore for
ward Randie Wirt to the line with 8
seconds remaining in the game.
Neither the series of timeouts
preceding her shots, nor the fact
that she had not been to the line
yet in the game seemed to faze her.
She knocked in both free throws,
putting the score at 62-59 and forc
ing Stanford to look for the three
to tie it up.
Powell took the ball and sped
down to her bench, calling a time
out with 4.8 seconds left.
The Cardinal ran an inbounds
play from the sideline with Powell
getting the first look before dish
ing it to Yamasaki, whose shot
went wide just as the buzzer
sounded.
"I think people wanted to do
so well," VanDerveer said, "And,

it got the pace going a little too
quickly and people were forcing
plays that just weren't there. We
had some opportunities at the
end there but the shots just
didn't fell."
Adding to the team's burden
was its lack of experience in close
games. With few exceptions, Stan
ford found itself sitting pretty at
the end of the game throughout
the season while Colorado's play in
the Big 12 gave it the advantage in
such a situation.
"We drill this stuff every day,
but it's very different in a game
than in practice," said Van-
Derveer. "You need these type of
games."
While falling short of its post
season goals, the team finished
with a 32-3 overall record that in
cluded a perfect Pacific 10 Con
ference regular season. Despite
losing both Yamasaki and
Donaphin from the starting line
up, along with the other three se
niors of the live-woman graduat
ing core, next year's squad will re-
