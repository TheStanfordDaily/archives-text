# Cardinal awaits big decisions from juniors
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
So much about sports depends on an intan
gible and at most times unwarranted feeling of
hope.
The hope that upset is possible.
The hope that fate is generous.
The hope of the Stanford men's basketball
program has been placed on the shoulders of

juniors Casey Jacobsen and Curtis Borchardt
all year. And now, even in the season's turbu
lent demise, the hope fora successful future al
ready weighs on the shoulders of the two stats.
But basketball is a future-oriented sport —
where fans and media offer little time for self
reflection and analysis. Innately we look to
wards the next season to soothe the wounds of
a present that doesn't quite pan out according
to preconceived visions.

So it was no surprise to Jacobsen, Bor
chardt or head coach Mike Montgomery,
when 30 minutes after a season-ending 23
point loss to Kansas, that questions surfaced
about whether the two would be back fora se
nior campaign.
"I don't want to be a jerk about it but 1 think
I speak for both Borch and I when I say that
we're here [at this press conference] to comment
on this game [against Kansas]," Jacobsen said.
To which Montgomery supportively mum
bled, "Good answer. Good for you."
Now, almost two weeks after the loss, Jacob
sen, who respectfully declined to comment
about whether or not he had played his last
game in a Cardinal uniform, is expected to offi
cially announce his decision to enter the NBA
draft in the next few weeks.
The 6-foot-6 shooting guard from Glendo
ra, Calif, is no stranger to draft speculation. Last
year, he made a very public decision to return
to Stanford for his junior season and is this year
expected to be a late first-round draft pick if he
does decide to leave early.
But then again Stanford, whose basketball
program boast a 100 percent graduation rate
for its players, isn't going anywhere either.
Borchardt's future at Stanford, on the other
hand, is complicated by several factors: First,
his recent engagement to Stanford point guard
Susan King (who still has three years of eligibil
ity remaining) is definitely a consideration. Sec
ond, a Cardinal career riffled with injury (he's
broken his right foot twice in three years) will
forever sit in the back of his mind as a potential
risk. And third, outside projections that he's a
definite NBA lottery pick also contribute to his
"dilemma."
Regardless, both players will benefit from

The Cardinal's future is uncertain, as juniors Casey Jacobsen and Curtis Borchardt will weigh their op

new rules that allow collegiate
players to test professional waters
without rendering themselves in
eligible for NCAA competition, as
long as they stay away from agents.
Borchardt's father Jon said that
any player who doesn't test the wa
ters "would be a fool," which is
probably an indicator of what Bor
chardt's decision will ultimately be.
And, if you were watching Stan
ford beat Arizona in Tucson in
February you would have heard a
television commentator regurgi
tate a statement made by an
"anonymous" Cardinal star won
dering whether or not it makes
more sense fora player to build up
his strength while battling against
the NBA's best or to stay in college

and try to gain weight.
If the commentator's statement
were truthful it would suggest that
a certain center with "question
able" body strength might have
made up his mind a long time ago
to leave — or was at least in the
early stages of convincing himself.
Ironically, the odds of both men
returning are probably better than
a scenario of only one of the two
players coming back. Sources sug
gest that Jacobsen's decision to re
turn to Stanford is inextricably
bound to Borchardt's plans to re
turn and whether or not he feels
Stanford can contend fora confer
ence and title next year.
The final embarrassing loss to
Kansas would leave any competi
tor hungry, however. No great
basketball player would ever want
to end a career like that and
whether they admit it or not, the
idea of that game, which exists as

ail overriding microcosm of the
season as a whole, still lingers.
It was an unpoetic ending to a
season that was all about proving
the critics wrong and perhaps an
unpoetic ending to three years of
basketball brilliance in Jacobsen's
case. But as March Madness goes
there are 63 unpoetic endings.
It seems unlikely that Mont
gomery's prediction will come
true. If the two come out of the
testing period with positive
prospects, Sixth Man Club mem
bers can kiss their dreams of "one
more year" goodbye.
How many of us would risk los
ing a guaranteed $9 million over
the next three years fora chance at
an unlikely title, three more Stan
ford quarters and a season chock
full of potential injuries and bad
performances? Be honest.
But there's always hope.
Isn't there?
