# Cardinal awaits big decisions from juniors

### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
So much about sports depends on an intan
gible and at most times unwarranted feeling of
hope.
The hope that upset is possible.
The hope that fate is generous.
The hope of the Stanford men's basketball
program has been placed on the shoulders of

juniors Casey Jacobsen and Curtis Borchardt
all year. And now, even in the season's turbu
lent demise, the hope fora successful future al
ready weighs on the shoulders of the two stats.
But basketball is a future-oriented sport â€”
where fans and media offer little time for self
reflection and analysis. Innately we look to
wards the next season to soothe the wounds of
a present that doesn't quite pan out according
to preconceived visions.

So it was no surprise to Jacobsen, Bor
chardt or head coach Mike Montgomery,
when 30 minutes after a season-ending 23
point loss to Kansas, that questions surfaced
about whether the two would be back fora se
nior campaign.
"I don't want to be a jerk about it but 1 think
I speak for both Borch and I when I say that
we're here [at this press conference] to comment
on this game [against Kansas]," Jacobsen said.
To which Montgomery supportively mum
bled, "Good answer. Good for you."
Now, almost two weeks after the loss, Jacob
sen, who respectfully declined to comment
about whether or not he had played his last
game in a Cardinal uniform, is expected to offi
cially announce his decision to enter the NBA
draft in the next few weeks.
The 6-foot-6 shooting guard from Glendo
ra, Calif, is no stranger to draft speculation. Last
year, he made a very public decision to return
to Stanford for his junior season and is this year
expected to be a late first-round draft pick if he
does decide to leave early.
But then again Stanford, whose basketball
program boast a 100 percent graduation rate
for its players, isn't going anywhere either.
Borchardt's future at Stanford, on the other
hand, is complicated by several factors: First,
his recent engagement to Stanford point guard
Susan King (who still has three years of eligibil
ity remaining) is definitely a consideration. Sec
ond, a Cardinal career riffled with injury (he's
broken his right foot twice in three years) will
forever sit in the back of his mind as a potential
risk. And third, outside projections that he's a
definite NBA lottery pick also contribute to his
"dilemma."
Regardless, both players will benefit from
