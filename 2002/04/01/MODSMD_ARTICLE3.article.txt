# Concert network close to booking ex-'Grateful' bassist
## Event would be held at Frost Amphitheater and is expected to sell out 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
If the Stanford Concert Network final
izes current contract negotiations, former
Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh and his
band, Phil Lesh & Friends, will perform at
Frost Amphitheater on Sunday, June 2.
"The paperwork is not 100 percent com
pleted," said senior Andrew Gustin, the
concert network's general manager. The
concert network plans to resolve contractu

al details with Lesh within several days.
However, the event has already been
posted on Lesh's Web site,
http://www.phillesh.net.
If plans come to fruition, the concert
network's members anticipate a huge
show, possibly filling the theater to its
6,900-person capacity.
"It's going to be a spectacle, the likes of
which this campus has not seen since
1989," Gustin said. "The event is going to
be bigger than the show itself."
Between 1982 and 1989, the Grateful
Dead performed at Frost 14 times. In
1989, the University prohibited the band
from returning to campus because of secu
rity issues and illegal activities brought by
the droves of "Dead Heads" that invaded

Stanford to hear them play. A major rock
concert has not been held in Frost since
1989.
"Back in the day, Frost was a regular
venue in the circuit, then it just disap
peared from the scene," Gustin said. "It's
regarded as one of the premier venues on
the West Coast."
According to a press release from the
concert network, pre-sale tickets for Stan
ford students would cost $20. The concert
would be an "afternoon-twilight show"
running from 2 to 7 p.m. on the weekend
preceding Dead Week.
"I can't imagine a better place to be on a
beautiful Sunday afternoon," said junior
Drew Baglino, the concert network's pro
duction manager.

According to Gustin, the concert net
work has been working for nearly two
years to convince the University to allow it
to hold a large-scale event in Frost.
"It's very difficult to get approval
from all the different offices involved,"
Gustin said. The concert network has
worked with the Office of Student Activ
ities, Risk Management, the Stanford
Department of Public Safety, Stanford
Lively Arts, the ASSU and the Registrar's
scheduling office, as well as with events
services and the grounds department, to
make the event a possibility.
Gustin added that bringing Lesh to
campus is complicated by the Grateful
Dead's history with Stanford.
"There is a lingering negativity about

the Grateful Dead," he said. " There are
still people in the administration who
weren't happy with what happened in the
late '80s."
Issues surrounding funding for the
event have also been a challenge for the
concert network.
"Within the OSA itself, the show has a
lot of support, but they are very concerned
about the financial issues related to it,"
Baglino said.
To gain University support, the concert
network has had to produce sufficient
funds, excluding revenue from ticket sales,
to finance the event. According to Baglino,
ASSU special fees would provide the ma-
