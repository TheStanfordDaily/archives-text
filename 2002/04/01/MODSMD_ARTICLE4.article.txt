# Card lassoes Longhorns
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All right, Stanford, no more excuses. The
college basketball season had its "One Shining
Moment," even if the Cardinal team did not,
and rain and rough winter quarter schedules
have given way to sun and GPA-boosters. So,
you are officially out of excuses to not be at
Sunken Diamond this spring.
While you were away, the top-ranked Cardi
nal (19-6) took five of six non-conference games
during the break. It now approaches its confer
ence season playing just the way it must if it ex
pects to capture its fifth Pacific 10 Conference
championship in the last six years.
Stanford closed out the month of March,
during which it amassed an 11-2 record, by tak
ing two of three games from No. 16 Texas (25-
8) at Sunken Diamond. The pair of victories,
which followed a three-game non-conference
sweep of rival Southern California in Los Ange
les, gave the Cardinal its 10th consecutive regu
lar-season series win.
Thursday's series opener with Texas, how
ever, provided enough excitement for all six
games over the break combined. While Stan
ford entered the series with a team batting av
erage of .337, head coach Augie Garrido's
Texas team came to Palo Alto on the heels of a
school-record four straight shutouts and a
miniscule team LRA of 2.38. The Longhorns
also brought the stinging memory of two one
run losses to the Cardinal on the final day of the
2001 NCAA Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Having limited the Cardinal to just four hits
in eight innings and closing in on their ninth

win in a row, the Longhorns held a 6-1 lead en
tering the bottom of the ninth inning on Thurs
day night but couldn't escape with a victory.
Senior second baseman Chris O'Riordan
blasted a game-tying, two-out grand slam that
just barely stayed fair down the left-field line,
and Stanford finished the improbable come
back with a 1 Oth-inning RBI single from sopho
more Johnny Ash to take the game 7-6.
"That's why baseball is a great game," said
head coach Mark Marquess, "because there is
no clock."
Stanford opened the ninth inning with

three straight singles that brought home one
run and brought out the rally caps at Sunken
Diamond. However, Texas reliever Alan
Bomer retired the next two batters with a
strikeout and a foul out. With the Cardinal
hanging onto its final breath, Marquess sent
his fourth pinch hitter of the inning to the bat
ter's box. Freshman Chris Carter induced a
walk to load the bases and put the tying run at
the plate in O'Riordan, whose homer sent the
remaining fans into a frenzy.

On Thursday night, senior second baseman Chris O'Riordan launched a grand slam in the bottom of
the 9th inning that skimmed the left field foul pole and tied the game. The Cardinal notched its tenth con
secutive regular-season series victory against the No. 16 Longhorns this weekend.
Perhaps all the drama in Thurs
day's ninth inning left both the
Cardinal and Longhorn bats ex
hausted, as in Friday night's con
test neither team scored until
Texas broke through with two
runs in the top of the 10th to earn
a 2-0 victory.
While Stanford junior Tim
Cunningham was brilliant on the
hill, shackling the Texas offense
with eight strikeouts in a career
high nine innings, his opponent
on the mound was simply even
better. In the battle of two south
paws, sophomore Justin Simmons
improved to 8-0 by going the dis
tance for the third time this season
and confounding Cardinal hitters
all evening. Simmons lowered his
ERA to 1.67 and extended his per
sonal scoreleSs-innings streak to
18, while Texas collected its fifth
shutout in its last six games.
"Tim Cunningham pitched a
great game to shut out Texas for
nine innings," said Marquess. "Un
fortunately, we just couldn't get
him any runs because Justin Sim
mons pitched a great game as well."
The Longhorn sophomore
truly earned the win by stepping
up with a gutsy performance in the
Stanford eighth. Simmons stared
at two of the Cardinal's most dan
gerous batters with the bases
loaded and one out, but he didn't
falter with t he game on the line. He
sent both junior outfielder Jason

Cooper and sophomore Carlos
Quentin back to the dugout on
strikes to end Stanford's best threat
of the contest.
In Saturday's finale, Cardinal
junior John Hudgins picked up
his fourth straight win with his
first career collegiate complete
game in a 7-2 Stanford win. He
scattered five Texas hits and piled
up seven strikeouts to improve to
5-0 on the year and has solidified
the back end of the Stanford pitch
ing rotation ever since joining it in
early March.
"It felt really good to get my first
collegiate complete game," said
Hudgins after a season-high
crowd of 3,280 witnessed his gem
at Sunken Diamond. "I just tried
to take it one pitch at a time, and it
all came together."
Hudgins benefited from a four
run first inning that set the tone for
the entire afternoon. Losing pitch
er Ray Clark gave up RBI singles to
junior Ryan Garko and, later,
Carter, with a two-RBI double by
Quentin coming in between. While
Clark lasted just four innings, Stan
ford batters tagged the rest of the
Texas staff for one run in the fifth
and two in the sixth, holding on the
rest of the way for the victory.
After dominating the injury
ridden Trojans in Los Angeles and
taking care of the Longhorns at
home, the Cardinal seem to have
hit its stride heading into the al
ways challenging league schedule.
With a final tune-up tomorrow
night against the University of San
Francisco (8-22, 1-10 West Coast
Conference), Stanford will head to

at Sunken Diamond. "I just tried
to take it one pitch at a time, and it
all came together."
Hudgins benefited from a four
run first inning that set the tone for
the entire afternoon. Losing pitch
er Ray Clark gave up RBI singles to
junior Ryan Garko and, later,
Carter, with a two-RBI double by
Quentin coming in between. While
Clark lasted just four innings, Stan
ford batters tagged the rest of the
Texas staff for one run in the fifth
and two in the sixth, holding on the
rest of the way for the victory.

ways challenging league schedule.

Tucson to open Pac-10 play
against an Arizona squad that has
impressed in the preseason but has
gone largely untested thus far.
The Cardinal host the Dons
with a 6 p.m. first pitch sched
uled at Sunken Diamond tomor
row night.
All right, Stanford, no more excuses. The
college basketball season had its "One Shining
Moment," even if the Cardinal team did not,
and rain and rough winter quarter schedules
have given way to sun and GPA-boosters. So,
you are officially out of excuses to not be at
Sunken Diamond this spring.
While you were away, the top-ranked Cardi
nal (19-6) took five of six non-conference games
during the break. It now approaches its confer
ence season playing just the way it must if it ex
pects to capture its fifth Pacific 10 Conference
championship in the last six years.
Stanford closed out the month of March,
during which it amassed an 11-2 record, by tak
ing two of three games from No. 16 Texas (25-
8) at Sunken Diamond. The pair of victories,
which followed a three-game non-conference
sweep of rival Southern California in Los Ange
les, gave the Cardinal its 10th consecutive regu
lar-season series win.
Thursday's series opener with Texas, how
ever, provided enough excitement for all six
games over the break combined. While Stan
ford entered the series with a team batting av
erage of .337, head coach Augie Garrido's
Texas team came to Palo Alto on the heels of a
school-record four straight shutouts and a
miniscule team LRA of 2.38. The Longhorns
also brought the stinging memory of two one
run losses to the Cardinal on the final day of the
2001 NCAA Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Having limited the Cardinal to just four hits
in eight innings and closing in on their ninth

win in a row, the Longhorns held a 6-1 lead en
tering the bottom of the ninth inning on Thurs
day night but couldn't escape with a victory.
Senior second baseman Chris O'Riordan
blasted a game-tying, two-out grand slam that
just barely stayed fair down the left-field line,
and Stanford finished the improbable come
back with a 1 Oth-inning RBI single from sopho
more Johnny Ash to take the game 7-6.
"That's why baseball is a great game," said
head coach Mark Marquess, "because there is
no clock."
Stanford opened the ninth inning with

three straight singles that brought home one
run and brought out the rally caps at Sunken
Diamond. However, Texas reliever Alan
Bomer retired the next two batters with a
strikeout and a foul out. With the Cardinal
hanging onto its final breath, Marquess sent
his fourth pinch hitter of the inning to the bat
ter's box. Freshman Chris Carter induced a
walk to load the bases and put the tying run at
the plate in O'Riordan, whose homer sent the
remaining fans into a frenzy.


CHRISSY MINYARD/The Stanford Daily File
On Thursday night, senior second baseman Chris O'Riordan launched a grand slam in the bottom of
the 9th inning that skimmed the left field foul pole and tied the game. The Cardinal notched its tenth con
secutive regular-season series victory against the No. 16 Longhorns this weekend.
Perhaps all the drama in Thurs
day's ninth inning left both the
Cardinal and Longhorn bats ex
hausted, as in Friday night's con
test neither team scored until
Texas broke through with two
runs in the top of the 10th to earn
a 2-0 victory.
While Stanford junior Tim
Cunningham was brilliant on the
hill, shackling the Texas offense
with eight strikeouts in a career
high nine innings, his opponent
on the mound was simply even
better. In the battle of two south
paws, sophomore Justin Simmons
improved to 8-0 by going the dis
tance for the third time this season
and confounding Cardinal hitters
all evening. Simmons lowered his
ERA to 1.67 and extended his per
sonal scoreleSs-innings streak to
18, while Texas collected its fifth
shutout in its last six games.
"Tim Cunningham pitched a
great game to shut out Texas for
nine innings," said Marquess. "Un
fortunately, we just couldn't get
him any runs because Justin Sim
mons pitched a great game as well."
The Longhorn sophomore
truly earned the win by stepping
up with a gutsy performance in the
Stanford eighth. Simmons stared
at two of the Cardinal's most dan
gerous batters with the bases
loaded and one out, but he didn't
falter with t he game on the line. He
sent both junior outfielder Jason

Cooper and sophomore Carlos
Quentin back to the dugout on
strikes to end Stanford's best threat
of the contest.
In Saturday's finale, Cardinal
junior John Hudgins picked up
his fourth straight win with his
first career collegiate complete
game in a 7-2 Stanford win. He
scattered five Texas hits and piled
up seven strikeouts to improve to
5-0 on the year and has solidified
the back end of the Stanford pitch
ing rotation ever since joining it in
early March.
"It felt really good to get my first
collegiate complete game," said
Hudgins after a season-high
crowd of 3,280 witnessed his gem
at Sunken Diamond. "I just tried
to take it one pitch at a time, and it
all came together."
