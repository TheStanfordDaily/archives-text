# Card lassoes Longhorns

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All right, Stanford, no more excuses. The
college basketball season had its "One Shining
Moment," even if the Cardinal team did not,
and rain and rough winter quarter schedules
have given way to sun and GPA-boosters. So,
you are officially out of excuses to not be at
Sunken Diamond this spring.
While you were away, the top-ranked Cardi
nal (19-6) took five of six non-conference games
during the break. It now approaches its confer
ence season playing just the way it must if it ex
pects to capture its fifth Pacific 10 Conference
championship in the last six years.
Stanford closed out the month of March,
during which it amassed an 11-2 record, by tak
ing two of three games from No. 16 Texas (25-
8) at Sunken Diamond. The pair of victories,
which followed a three-game non-conference
sweep of rival Southern California in Los Ange
les, gave the Cardinal its 10th consecutive regu
lar-season series win.
Thursday's series opener with Texas, how
ever, provided enough excitement for all six
games over the break combined. While Stan
ford entered the series with a team batting av
erage of .337, head coach Augie Garrido's
Texas team came to Palo Alto on the heels of a
school-record four straight shutouts and a
miniscule team LRA of 2.38. The Longhorns
also brought the stinging memory of two one
run losses to the Cardinal on the final day of the
2001 NCAA Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Having limited the Cardinal to just four hits
in eight innings and closing in on their ninth

win in a row, the Longhorns held a 6-1 lead en
tering the bottom of the ninth inning on Thurs
day night but couldn't escape with a victory.
Senior second baseman Chris O'Riordan
blasted a game-tying, two-out grand slam that
just barely stayed fair down the left-field line,
and Stanford finished the improbable come
back with a 1 Oth-inning RBI single from sopho
more Johnny Ash to take the game 7-6.
"That's why baseball is a great game," said
head coach Mark Marquess, "because there is
no clock."
Stanford opened the ninth inning with

three straight singles that brought home one
run and brought out the rally caps at Sunken
Diamond. However, Texas reliever Alan
Bomer retired the next two batters with a
strikeout and a foul out. With the Cardinal
hanging onto its final breath, Marquess sent
his fourth pinch hitter of the inning to the bat
ter's box. Freshman Chris Carter induced a
walk to load the bases and put the tying run at
the plate in O'Riordan, whose homer sent the
remaining fans into a frenzy.

On Thursday night, senior second baseman Chris O'Riordan launched a grand slam in the bottom of
the 9th inning that skimmed the left field foul pole and tied the game. The Cardinal notched its tenth con
secutive regular-season series victory against the No. 16 Longhorns this weekend.
