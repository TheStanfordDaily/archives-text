## Twenty-year-old man dies during possible car theft 
### HELEN KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While students took finals
last quarter, a 20-year-old bur
glary suspect was shot and
killed by a police officer at the
base of the Stanford foothills on
March 20.
Around 1 p.m., Pedro
Calderon of East Palo Alto tried
to flee from police in a stolen
BMW on Stanford Avenue near
Raimundo Way.
Stanford Police deputy Jeff
Bell and Palo Alto officer Jessica
Perryman responded to a call
that a male who possibly
matched the description of a car
burglary suspect was in the
area, said Deputy Terrance
Helm of the Santa Clara Coun
ty Sheriffs Office.
"Being the sneaky one that I
am, I parked and waited for
him," Perryman told the San
jose Mercury News. "It just so
happened I was parked right be
hind the car he was going for."

Perryman got out of her car
and dived headfirst into the
BMW as Calderon tried to
drive away, reported the Mer
cury News.
"Then he just drags me
away," Perryman said. "He was
ramming his car into every
thing, fighting me. He was big
ger. But I have a job."
Then Perryman and Bell
each fired one shot, Helm said.
"We are still waiting for bullet
reports to see which of the two
bullets was the one that killed
Calderon," Helm said.
Perryman said she fired her
semi-automatic out of self-de
fense. She told the Mercury
News that just before the bul
lets were fired, she felt like she
was being rolled "like a ciga
rette," then she was dropped
to the ground.
Four days after Calderon's
death, his family and friends
protested along Stanford Av
enue. They questioned the
shooting and said they had not
been informed of his death until
36 hours after it had occurred.
"I don't believe the cop felt
threatened, because thev are
prepared for these tilings," Alicia
Calderon, the mother of" the sus
pect, said to the Mercury News.
"She could have hit him in the leg;
she didn't have to kill him."
Some youths from the
Bayshore Christian Ministries of
East Palo Alto said that Calderon's
death was uncalled for and per

haps even a racist act.
Both Ferryman and Bell have
been put on administrative
leave while the investigation
continues.
Perryman told the San Francis
co Chronicle that she had "fielded
'a billion' calls from colleagues, city
officials, old friends and others"
and added that "It makes me feel
like I'm doing the right thing, be
cause you wonder."
While Calderon's relatives
cannot understand why the po

lice had to shoot and kill
Calderon, Helm said that cars,
used wrongly, can also be deadly
weapons.
Detectives discovered that
Calde ron was allegedly associated
with a series of carjackings, kid
nappings and automobile thefts in
San Mateo County, Helm said.
Calderon is also suspected of being
involved in a drive-by-shooting
and kidnapping in Redwood City
in January, according to the San
Francisco Chronicle.
