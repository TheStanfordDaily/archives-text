On April 1, 1999, The Daily
printed an "article" about men's
basketball coach Mike Mont
gomery leaving Stanford to coach
the LA Clippers.
"Monty has left the building.
" The Los Angeles Clippers, oil
to one of the worst starts in N BA
history, fired head coach Chris
Ford yesterday and replaced him
with Stanford men's basketball
coach Mike Montgomery.
"'Everyone told Mike that he
couldn't win at Stanford, and he
proved them wrong,' Clippers
Vice President for Basketball
Operations Elgin Baylor said at
a press conference. 'We think

he'll prove them wrong here,
too.'
"The announcement was made
at the Clippers current home, the
Los Angeles Sports Arena. Mont
gomery said he was excited about
what many view as an unenviable
j°b ;
'"It's a big task, for sure,'
Montgomery said. 'But 1 think
I'm ready. There's some talent
on this team, and I think I can
win with it.'
"Montgomery, who in 16
years took Stanford from confer
ence whipping boy to national
powerhouse, takes over a Clip
pers team that is 3-26 on the

1999
year. The franchise, which
moves into the new Staples Cen
ter in Los Angeles next season, is
a perennial basement-dweller.
He will be on the bench tonight
in Dallas for the Clippers game
with the Mavericks.
"He plans immediately to shake
up the team, benching former Pa
cific 10 Conference rivals Derrick
Martin and Pooh Richardson of
UCLA and Lamond Murray of
California. 'Also, we're hoping to
sign Dion Cross and Rich Jackson
soon,' he said.
Bottom Line: And the pendulum undu
lates — whipping boy we are no more,
but national powerhouse? Doubtful.
