Insulin Signaling in Disease and Development
Sophomore Preference Seminar
Professor Michael Simon
3 Units
M/W 2:15-3:30 Redwood G-19
DESCRIPTION: Insulin is widely recognized as the key hormone con
trolling the metabolism of sugar in our bodies. This course will explore
this role for insulin. Among trie questions that will be addressed are:
How does insulin function? What controls how much insulin is made?
Which aspects of insulin function are aberrant in patients with insulin
related defects (diabetes mellitus) ? Why does the lack of insulin lead
to the disease symptoms? How can the treatments for diabetes be
improved (including the possibility of stem cell treatments)? In addi
tion, the course will cover exciting recent findings from model organ
isms such as fruit flies and worms about new roles for insulin. These
findings include the discoveries that insulin plays key roles in regulat
ing the size of individual cells and the longevity of whole organisms.
POLITICAL SCIENCE 18N
Mexican Politics
Freshman Preference Seminar
Professor Beatriz Magaloni
5 Units
[38476]
F 10:00-11:50 Bldg. 200, room 124
DESCRIPTION: Over the last decade Mexican politics has witnessed
two remarkable transformations. The Partido Revolutionary
Institutional (PRI), which ruled Mexico for over seventy years, lost
power, and the country transited to democracy. An economic transfor
mation of tremendous consequences took place simultaneously, as
Mexico embraced free markets, privatized state enterprises, and
signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and
Canada which opened its economy to international trade. This course
will explore the dynamics of political and economic change in Mexico,
with an emphasis on this dual transformation.
STATISTICS 45N [38074]
Our Fractal World?
Freshman Preference Seminar
Professor Dave Donoho
3 Units
M/W 3:15-4:30 Bldg. 380, room 383P
DESCRIPTION: Over the last 30 years, mathematicians, physicists, and
other scientists have claimed evidence of patterns such as fractals and
multifractals throughout nature, and even in non-natural phenomena
like finance. Such patterns involving infinitely repeated geometric
structures, are beautiful to look at, and fun to learn about, but the
claims of the proponents of these ideas have invited backlash. Books
for the non-matnematician audience explain concepts like fractal
power laws and self-similiarity, and we will use one of these. We will
also discuss the evidence for fractal-like behavior in different fields and
discuss why these ideas can be so attractive to proponents and yet
invite strong counter reactions from other scientists.
