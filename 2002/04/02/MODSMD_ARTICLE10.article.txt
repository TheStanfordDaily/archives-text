# Supreme Court to review three-strikes laws
## 
### 
WASH INCHON (AP) â€” The
Supreme Court said yesterday it will re
view whether some three-strikes-and
out sentencing laws result in unconsti
tutionally harsh prison terms, such as
up to life behind bars, for shoplifting
videotapes from Kmart.
The court agreed to hear appeals in
volving two California thieves sentenced
to terms ranging from 25 years to life for
small-time crimes that might otherwise
have meant just a few months in jail.
The Supreme Court will consider
whether long sentences were unconsti
tutionally cruel or unusual punish
ment fora heroin addict who shoplift
ed videotapes worth $153 and an
AIDS patient who shoved three golf
clubs down his pants leg and tried to
walk out of a pro shop.
The court's eventual ruling could
be limited to the way the law is applied

in California, or it could make a more
general statement about how far states
may go in using similar laws to win
very long prison terms for relatively
minor crimes.
Twenty-six states and the federal
government have some version of a
three-strikes law, which typically al
lows a life prison term or something
close to it fora criminal convicted of a
third felony.
Critics say the laws are too harsh and
inflexible in general, and particularly so
in California, which has the nation's
strictest three-strikes law. It requires a
sentence of 25 years to life in prison for
any felony conviction if the criminal was
previously convicted of two serious or
violent felonies.
Leondro Andrade was convicted of
twice stuffing videotapes down his
pants at southern California Kmart

stores in 1995.
He had previous burglary convic
tions, making him eligible for extra
punishment under California's three
strikes law.
"No other state in the country has
such a sentencing scheme where misde
meanor conduct can be the basis for an
indeterminate life sentence," said An
drade's lawyer, University of Southern
California Law School professor Erwin
Chemerinsky.
A state court upheld Andrade's sen
tence, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in a widely noted decision last
year, ruled it unconstitutional. The rul
ing was limited to cases like his, and did
not overturn the three-strikes law itself.
A divided three-judge panel of the
appeals court found Andrade's sentence
"grossly disproportionate" to the theft,
and said Supreme Court rulings require

a trial judge to examine whether the
punishment fits the crime.
The Supreme Court also said it will
hear a case that came out the other way.
A state court upheld Gary Ewing's sen
tence of 25 years to life in prison for try
ing to steal three golf clubs at an El Se
gundo, Calif., golf course.
Ewing had four prior convictions for
robbery and burglary. Although prose
cutors could have charged him with a
misdemeanor in the golf club case, they
chose to charge him with a felony under
the state's three-strikes law.
"Serving 25 years to life for stealing
golf clubs is cruel and unusual punish
ment," Ewing's lawyer wrote in asking
the Supreme Court to get involved.
California voters and lawmakers ap
proved the three-strikes law in 1994
amid public furor over the kidnapping
and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas.
