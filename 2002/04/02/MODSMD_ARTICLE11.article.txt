# Silicon Valley tops 'Net list

BOSTON (AP) â€” Silicon Valley still rules, but
an annual survey of America's most Internet
savvy cities found that Boston and Salt Lake City
made huge strides over the past year.
Boston jumped 12 places to No. 4 in this
year's survey, published in the May edition of
Yahoo! Internet Life magazine. Salt Lake City
jumped 23 places to sixth, though the magazine
said it could be a one-time spike caused by the re
cent Winter Olympics.
San Francisco, San Jose, Calif., and Austin,
Texas, stayed in the top three spots, which
they've held in all but one of the five surveys.
Don Willmott, the magazine's technology edi
tor, said the biggest news may be the fact that
numbers were up almost everywhere, despite the
recession. It took a score of 36 out of 40 to win this
year, up from 33.3.
"Everyone's getting better," Willmott said.
The magazine uses a formula that measures
more than just Internet use and high-tech jobs to
get a sense of which communities make the most
of the Web. Willmott said that analysis includes
basic stats, the extent to which businesses are on
line and how sophisticated the users are.
"We measure that by how often they shop and
how many have gotten fast access," he said.
The formula also includes an evaluation of
content available in the area, including a ranking
of how well local government uses the Net. That
helped give Boston a boost.
"It really is one of the best city Web sites," Will
mott said of cityolboston.gov.
Top-ranked San Francisco has the highest per
centage of households using the Net (78.8), is No.
2 in online spending per user ($356) and in do
mains per 1,000 firms (4,163), and sixth in broad
band use and interest (54.9 percent). The data is
compiled from Forrester Research and Matthew
Zook of the Internet Geography Project.
The magazine ranks 86 metropolitan areas.
Seven of the top 21 areas are in California. The
bottom three this year were Tulsa, Okla., Scran
ton, Pa. and Gary, Ind.
