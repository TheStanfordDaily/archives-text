## The 						Stanford Daily Priority houses on campus should be limited 
### 
Published Since 1891

Row houses, the crownjewels of the Stan
ford spring housing draw, have long
been extremely difficult to draw into.
This situation will only be exacerbated
by the recent decision to convert a Row house —
either Storey, Mars or Grove Lasuen — into a
theme dorm for the Human Biology Program.
Residential Education officials said the
move was necessitated by Yost's change from a
Human Biology focus house to an immersive
Spanish and Portuguese language theme
house. By all indications, the Yost language
program will provide a positive experience for
residents of that house and for the communi
ty at large. However, we worry that the contin
ued creation of new priority housing in desir
able locations such as the Row will place fur
ther restrictions on the dwindling supply of
desirable housing options for the general un
dergraduate population.
The goal of theme and focus houses is to en-

rich the experience of residents and non-resi
dents by providing a hub for discussion and out
reach by particular campus communities. The
houses attract members of a community by of
fering them priority in the Draw, virtually en
suring that they can obtain housing there re
gardless of their Draw number.
The drawbacks are readily apparent to stu
dents who do not belong to die particular com
munities that the houses serve; for example,
those who don't speak Italian have little chance of
drawing into Casa Italiana, one of the most at
tractive residences on campus. It seems that de
sirable locations such as the Row, Manzanita Park
and many West Campus houses are turning into
a haven for those students whose interests hap
pen to be the ones that merit priority status.
Moreover, the criteria by which such houses
are designated fora given theme appear some
what confusing. According to Jane Camarillo, di
rector of Res Ed, one of the main reasons Yost was

selected as the site for the language immersion
program was the unpopularity of the Human Bi
ology focus house — die focus wasn't drawing
enough residents to fill the facility, lliis hardly
suggests that the Human Biology Program de
serves a new theme house in one of the campus's
most desirable locations.
Res Ed reasoned that a smaller house was
needed to draw sufficient numbers fora Human
Biology house, but if that were the case then per
haps a better policy would l)e to eliminate the
Human Biology theme or focus altogether.
The proliferation of new theme and focus
houses in attractive locations raises another con
cern, namely that certain academic programs or
cultural orientations may come with more at
tractive benefits than others. Since it would be
impossible to create enough theme or focus
houses to give all students an equal chance to ob
tain priority in a desirable house, we hope that
the University will reserve a significant number

of non-priority, non-fraternity Row houses that
everyone will have an equal chance of drawing
into. If it has not done so already, perhaps the
University should place a limit on the number of
theme and focus residences it designates, as it
has done with fraternities and sororities.
Overall, the University has done an ad
mirable job of providing quality guaranteed
housing to all its undergraduates for four years,
especially in the face of environmental restric
tions and a general housing shortage. However,
it must realize that attractive housing is still rela
tively scarce, and the more it reserves such hous
ing for specific groups of students, the less
chance the average student has of obtaining it.
Placing theme and focus houses in dormitory
complexes such as Wilbur Hall, which general
ly draw lower than Row Houses, would help to
ensure that those living there were truly inter
ested in the theme, as opposed to just using the
priority as a means to secure good housing.
