# SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
## Pro-life's fetus fallacy 
### 
One of the toughest things an
activist movement has to deal
with is the presence of mili
tant extremists, who give the
movement a black eye by virtue of their
actions. The anti-globalization move
ment has its roving bands of hooligans,
who descend on WTO meetings and en
gage in rioting and vandalism in the
host city. Environmentalists are saddled
with extremists who sabotage logging
and mining operations, sometimes
using arson and booby-traps to achieve
their goal. Worst of all, pro-life activists
must deal with a tiny group of so
ciopaths who get their kicks by murder
ing abortion doctors.
Seven abortion doctors have been as
sassinated in the past decade, and there

have been 17 unsuccess
ful attempts. After each
incident, mainstream
pro-life advocates are
quick to say that they ut
terly deplore such vio
lence, that these killings
make a mockery of the
pro-life movement.
The curious thing is

that even while pro-lifers are speaking
out against these killings, the vast major
ity of them steadfastly maintain that a
fetus is the moral equivalent of a human
being. Certainly this is the view of Stan
ford Students for Life, the University's
flagship pro-life organization. The ques
tion I have for SSFL, and most pro-lifers
in general, is this: If you truly believe
that fetuses are the same as human be
ings, and thus that abortion is murder,
then how can you condemn the killing of
abortion doctors?
To bring this point into focus, consider
an analogy. Suppose you are living in the
early 1940'5, during the Holocaust.
Would you condemn a brave German
civilian who, aware of the atrocities going
on, infiltrated an extermination camp
and assassinated the camp commander?
I, for one, would praise such a person. I
suspect the vast majority of Americans,
pro-life and otherwise, would agree.
Yet according to the mainstream pro
life perspective, the same kind of state
sanctioned killing is happening every day
at abortion clinics. After all, fetuses are no
less human, and no less worthy of being
defended, than thejewsof Nazi Germany.
So why, if they support assassinating the
Nazi camp commander, do they condemn
the killing of the abortion doctor?
There are at least three answers to
this problem. One is that pro-lifers se
cretly favor the killings of abortion doc
tors, but they outwardly adopt the op
posite position for public-opinion pur
poses. Given the number of wonderful,
decent people I know who are pro-life,
this explanation seems unrealistic.

Maybe a tiny few feel this way, but to cat
egorize most pro-lifers as secretly cheer
ing on the killing of abortion doctors
would surely be inaccurate.
A second explanation is that pro-lifers
would oppose killing Nazi commanders
because of their deep reverence for all life.
This position might describe a handful of
extreme pacifists, but it can't encompass
the majority of the pro-life movement.
Most pro-lifers are not pacifists; they fully
support the use of deadly force to save
lives and prevent atrocities. Just witness
our hawkish pro-life Republican Con
gressmen as an example.
In fact, most pro-liters' beliefs could be
rationalized by a third, far more plausible
explanation: They condemn the killing of
abortion doctors while supporting the as
sassination of Nazis because, deep down,
they don't feel that abortion is as evil as
the Holocaust. In other words, when
push comes to shove, they don't think that
fetuses are really the moral equivalent of
human beings.
So, most pro-lifers are, being illogical
when they claim that fetuses are the moral
equivalent of human beings. This does
not mean that it is illogical for such people
to be pro-life. A pro-lifer could easily say
that abortion should be illegal, even
though it is not as wrong as murder. After
all, we protect many beings against being
killed, even though we make no attempt
to say that they are the equivalent of hu
mans (think endangered species).
In fact, this is precisely the way that
many states treated abortion before Roe v.
Wade. Consider the Texas law that Roe
specifically overturned. This law criminal
ized abortion and sentenced doctors to up
to five years in prison for performing the
procedure. Five years â€” that's a whole lot
lighter a punishment than Texas gives to
murderers. Obviously, the Texas legisla
tors thought that abortion should be a
crime. But, just as obviously, they thought
that it was not nearly as serious a crime as
murder. In other words, a fetus deserves
protection, but it is not nearly the moral
equivalent of a human being.
Abortion is a sticky issue, possibly the
stickiest in our entire political arena. Both
sides are guilty of favoring simplistic
catchphrases and failing to think about
what those catchphrases really mean. So it
is with the pro-life slogan "Abortion is
murder." Simply put, this is a position
that few pro-lifers really believe.
Let's put away the jingoistic rhetoric.
Let's sit down and discuss abortion on
reasonable, logical terms. Otherwise,
we're just clouding an issue that needs
clarity above all else.
