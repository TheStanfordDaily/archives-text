Cartoon obscures truth about Arab-Israeli
peace process
The Mike Luckovich cartoon that ran
in Monday's Daily didn't simply distort the
truth, it turned the truth inside out.
According to the cartoon, Arab
leaders — with the same huge noses and
beady eyes Nazi caricaturists gave to Jews
in the 1930s — are willing to make peace
with Israel only if Israel disappears from
the map. In fact, the 22 Arab leaders who
met in Beirut on Mar. 27 voted unani
mously to make peace with Israel once the
Israelis abide by repeatedly confirmed
U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242
and 338, withdraw from the territory they
occupied in 1967 and allow the return of
Palestinian refugees.
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia spoke
directly to the Israeli people by saying that
if their government agreed to exchange
land for peace, "we will not hesitate to ac
cept the right of the Israeli people to live in
security with the people of the region."
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon re
jected the Saudi proposal when it first
came to light in February and launched a
massive surprise attack on Palestinian
refugee camps and cities. After three
weeks of death and destruction, he sus
pended the operation under pressure
from Washington, only to renew it with
even greater force on Mar. 29 in response
to a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings.
In Jan. 2001 Sharon halted peace talks
in which Israeli and Palestinian negotia
tors were close to reaching a peace settle
ment both sides could accept. Since taking
office, Sharon lias vowed never to return
more than 42 percent of the West Bank to
the Palestinians, and in order to enforce
this vow he has used the full force of the

powerful Israeli army against a largely
civilian population.
Young Palestinians who have known
only humiliation, deprivation and brutali
ty at the hands of Israeli occupation forces
are fighting back with suicide bombings, a
method of resistance that is both cruel and
indiscriminate. As a result of Sharon's un
yielding policies, the Israeli people are less
secure than at any time in their history,
and the Palestinians have lost everything
but their determination to end an oppres
sive and illegal occupation.
The Arab leaders caricatured in Luck
ovich's cartoon offered a way out of this
impasse with a solution that would pro
vide both peoples with peace and security.
The fact that Israel rejected the offer out
of hand is a tragedy for everyone in the
Middle East.

Sophistry no excuse for censorship
In response to the "Censor Noam
Chomsky" letter to the editor on April 1,1
must express an ardent opposition to the
author's call for censorship on campus. It's
clear that Mr. Gedalius's initiative was
mainly focused on his distaste for Noam
Chomsky, rather than his aversion to free
dom ofspeech.
When sufficiently impassioned, we all
have knee-jerk tendencies, but I must dis
agree with his claim that "we don't all have
the mental capacity to realize when we're
being duped." Assuming that the faculty
and student populations at Stanford are of
at least average adult psychological matu
rity, they seem well equipped to decide for

themselves whether or not they like what
Chomsky has to say.
Chomsky's freedom to preach is no
more detrimental to society than the con
fabulations of Rush Limbaugh, Dinesh
D'Souza or Lyndon Laßouche.
Sophistry is alive and well in the mod
ern world. While this makes it challenging
to distinguish fact from rhetoric, I think it
helps people develop important social and
ethical facilities, such as the ability discern
right from wrong. This could be, nay, ver
ily should be part of the Stanford educa
tion. Therefore, freedom of speech equals
good; censorship equals bad.
For those students still struggling to
distinguish between the sophist and sa
vant, 1 offer a general rule of thumb: the
sophists usually have funny names, like
those mentioned above.
