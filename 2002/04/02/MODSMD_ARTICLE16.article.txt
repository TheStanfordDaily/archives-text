# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Springtime can be a season of sorrow and renewal 
### BEVERLY HUMPHREY GUEST COLUMNIST 
Many years ago, my father died on the
Vernal Equinox. The celestial day that
epitomizes die renewal of the Earth is a
day of endings for me. When my father
left for whatever uncharted territory
awaited, part of my world went with him.
When I was a child, my father used to
carry me on his shoulders. We would go
down to the shore at night, and he would
point out the constellations. The world,
then, seemed beautiful and boundless.
He inscribed my books with phrases
like, "For aiittle scholar, who knows that a
thesaurus in not a Mesozoic reptile." He
instilled in me a love for all things incon
gruous.
My father was a true Renaissance man.
This is an overworked phrase, but he was

the genuine article. 1 le could do physics
as well as he could do an "Inspector
Clouseau" imitation. In the end, he was a
philosopher, and he excelled at that, too.
For me, as an only child, my father was
like the sibling with whom I had no hope
of competing. This was all right, however.
Just being able to bask in the warmth of
his humor, intelligence and compassion
was enough.
A sense of order pervaded our exis
tence when he was with us, as though ev
erything were neatly dusted and tucked
away in God's house. And then he was
gone.
There is another great man whom I
think about much of the time, hut espe
cially in March. He is Professor John
Hunter Thomas, who passed away in
1999. As a member of the Stanford facul
ty in the Department of Biological Sci

ences, he opened up the world of botany
for me.
John was a reserved man, and a man of
rulesâ€”a man, 1 believe, who was largely
misunderstood in an era of instant famil
iarity. I studied with him for quite a num
ber of years, before 1 was invited to call
him "John." In the final years, when 1
wanted to cheer him up, 1 called him
"JT."
After the long time of study under his
fine tutelage, 1 knew that I had finally
evolved into a true friend, during one of
our annual botanical trips to Yosemite. At
that time, my mother and I were invited
to join John and his great good friend, Joe
Bingaman, fora private gathering in a
valley meadow.
There, while we sat in the meadow
grass, John fired up his one-and-only an
nual cigar. And we all enjoyed a glass of

fine red wine, as we toasted the beauty of
that place and its botanical treasures.
I think of John Thomas in March, be
cause this is when the wildflowers begin to
bloom, and he opened my eyes to the
wonder of them all. As I write, the Cali
fornia poppies are emerging, as are the
lupine and the ceanothus here and there.
I know the botanical names for most of
them, courtesy of John, but I won't bore
you with the details. It's like my secret
handshake with JT.
Flowers are also emblematic of this
time, because my father's ashes were scat
tered on Daffodil Hill in the Sierra Neva
da. A daffodil almost seems like too gaudy
a bloom to represent a man of such mod
esty. He would have appreciated the gen
tle irony of it all.
These two men, John Thomas and my
father, taught me many levels of appreci

ation for the world. Some might argue
that knowing the botanical names for the
parts of a flower, or why stars glitter a cer
tain way, somehow diminishes the appre
ciation of their beauty. This is not true.
Knowledge never detracts from the aes
thetic experience; it only adds another
level of appreciation.
Whenever March comes around, 1 feel
like a child swaddled in a cloth of sorrows.
The seasons are all amiss during this
month. The crocuses I planted in the
mountains feel the warmth of impending
spring one day and are shrouded in snow
the next, light and dark alternate. This
is the rhythm of life at this time. Perhaps,
this is simply the rhythm of life.
