pitching by junior Tori Nyberg
and defense by senior shortstop
Robin Walker kept Cal silent for
five innings.
But the Bears came back in the
sixth when a leadoff walk, a single
and an intentional walk to Veroni
ca Nelson loaded the bases with
one out. Then, Chelsea Spencer
stepped into the box and came
through in the clutch for Cal, as
she roped a bases-clearing double
to left-center. Spencer was strand
ed on third base after Nyberg

struck out the following two hit
ters, but not before the Bears had
taken the lead, 3-1.
Stanford fought back in the top
of the seventh when sophomore
catcher Jessica Allister led off with
a double. Freshman Heather
Shook pinch ran for Allister and
proceeded to score when junior
left fielder Cassi Brangham roped
a double for the Cardinal to cut the
Bears' lead to 3-2
However, the Cardinal was not
able to put the tying run across the
plate. California senior pitcher Jo
celyn Forest struck out the next
three batters with Brangham
stranded on third base.
Both teams were then given
a night's rest before taking the
Field again Saturday afternoon,
this time on the Farm fora

The Cardinal was out for re
venge and claimed it in the first
contest of the day.
Junior Maureen LeCocq
pitched well and the Stanford of
fense broke through and scored
six runs.
Both sides were silent until
the bottom of the second, when
the Cardinal rallied for four
runs, including a two-out sin
gle by junior second baseman
Kira Ching that plated both
Walker and Mendoza to put
the game at 4-0.
Stanford attacked again in the
bottom of the fourth when Men
doza scored pinch-runner
Shook. Senior First-baseman
Sarah Beeson rounded out the
scoring with an RBI, plating the
sixth Cardinal run.
LeCocq finished off the shutout
and her 10th win of the season by
allowing just four hits.
Both teams took the field again
for one more close and hard
fought battle.
This time, the Bears scored first
as they broke out in the top of the
first with two runs. But again, the
Cardinal answered back immedi
ately with a run of its own when
Mendoza scored on a sacrifice fly
by Beeson.
