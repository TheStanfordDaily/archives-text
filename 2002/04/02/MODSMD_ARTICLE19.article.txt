With an undefeated regular
season, a unanimous No. 1 rank
ing and its 21st consecutive Pac-10
championship behind it, the Car
dinal was fired up to challenge all
comers. As expected, the meet was
a resounding success.
Sophomore Markus Rogan fin
ished second in the overall individ
ual high-points standings with 55,
while fellow sophomore Peter
Marshall tied for third with 54. Ju
nior Randall Hal rounded out
Stanford's top scorers in seventh
with 47 points.
Marshall entered seven events,
winning four of them and never
finishing lower than second place.
The first event of the weekend saw
Marshall teamed up with Bal, and
sophomores Andrew Schnell and
Bobby O'Bryan to set American

and NCAA records in the 200-
yard freestyle relay (1:16.49).
Amazingly, both Marshall and
O'Bryan touched with individual
splits under 19 seconds.
"You can't be disappointed
with an American record," Schnell
said. "It's a great feeling very few
people get to experience."
After an intense battle later that
night, Rogan narrowly out
touched teammate freshman Dan
Trupin in the 200 IM, winning the
first of two individual NCAA titles.
Their times of 1:44.03 and 1:44.08
are the second- and third-fastest in
Stanford history.
The most exciting swim of the
night came when Bal anchored
the 400 medley relay, crowning
stellar performances by Marshall,
Bruce and Dan VVestcott.
"1 le was behind the whole way,
and in the last 10 meters it looked
like he started walking on water,"
Bruce said. Bal touched first by
nine hundredths of a second.
"I've never seen anybody on a
relay do what he did," said head
coach Skip Kenney. "It really set the
tone for us for the next two days."
Friday's competition began with
another Cardinal victory in the 200
medley relay. Previous champions
Bal, Bruce and Marshall were
joined by freshman Matt McDon
ald to finish in 1:25.47.
"Matt really stepped up as a
freshman and had a great meet,"
Schnell said. "He did exactly what
we needed him to do."
Stanford's dominance contin
ued Friday with outstanding per
formances in all three 100-yard
events. Marshall took second in
the 100 butterfly behind Long
horn lan Crocker, who set an
American record. Marshall's ca
reer-best 46.39 was fourth in
Stanford history. He was fol
lowed by Cardinal freshmen Mc-
Donald and Jayme Cramer in
fourth and seventh.
Bruce's 53.39 finish in the
100 breaststroke was also fourth
in school history, and was fourth
at NCAAs.
Proving it has the best back
strokers in the nation, the Car
dinal placed four finalists in the
100 backstroke on Friday. Mar
shall won his first individual
NCAA championship with a

time of 45.91. Bal was third
(46.13), Westcott was fourth
(46.51), and Cramer was sixth
(46.95). All four men are among
the 10 best in Stanford history,
and this race alone garnered 64
points for the Cardinal.
Stanford's backstroke corps
continued to excel on Saturday in
the 200 backstroke. In a race
where one had to break the previ
ous pool record just to get to the
finals, Rogan and Marshall took
first and second place in 1:41.14
and 1:41.85.
Bruce also stunned the com
petition with a second-place, ca
reer-best 1:54.81 in the 200
breaststroke, winning much
needed points on the last day of
competition.
"To step up and move from
fifth to second was exactly what I
was hoping for," Bruce said.

Despite the best efforts of fresh
man Adam Peterson, the first Car
dinal diver to qualify for NCAAs
since 1996, the 100-plus point
deficit created by the four-member
Texas diving squad was too much
for Stanford to erase, and ulti
mately proved crucial to Texas'
razor-thin 11-point victory.
"We are definitely the Texas
Diving and Swimming team, not
the Texas Swimming and Diving
team," said Longhorn Brendan
Hansen.
In the end, nothing was more
clear than that Stanford has the
best swim team in the nation.
"I've never been more proud
of a team in my life," said Kenney,
who is in his 23rd year at Stan
ford. "They swam their hearts
out. These guys are just amazing,
and I have so much respect for
this team."
