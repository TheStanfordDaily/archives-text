With an undefeated regular
season, a unanimous No. 1 rank
ing and its 21st consecutive Pac-10
championship behind it, the Car
dinal was fired up to challenge all
comers. As expected, the meet was
a resounding success.
Sophomore Markus Rogan fin
ished second in the overall individ
ual high-points standings with 55,
while fellow sophomore Peter
Marshall tied for third with 54. Ju
nior Randall Hal rounded out
Stanford's top scorers in seventh
with 47 points.
Marshall entered seven events,
winning four of them and never
finishing lower than second place.
The first event of the weekend saw
Marshall teamed up with Bal, and
sophomores Andrew Schnell and
Bobby O'Bryan to set American

and NCAA records in the 200-
yard freestyle relay (1:16.49).
Amazingly, both Marshall and
O'Bryan touched with individual
splits under 19 seconds.
"You can't be disappointed
with an American record," Schnell
said. "It's a great feeling very few
people get to experience."
After an intense battle later that
night, Rogan narrowly out
touched teammate freshman Dan
Trupin in the 200 IM, winning the
first of two individual NCAA titles.
Their times of 1:44.03 and 1:44.08
are the second- and third-fastest in
Stanford history.
The most exciting swim of the
night came when Bal anchored
the 400 medley relay, crowning
stellar performances by Marshall,
Bruce and Dan VVestcott.
"1 le was behind the whole way,
and in the last 10 meters it looked
like he started walking on water,"
Bruce said. Bal touched first by
nine hundredths of a second.
"I've never seen anybody on a
relay do what he did," said head
coach Skip Kenney. "It really set the
tone for us for the next two days."
Friday's competition began with
another Cardinal victory in the 200
medley relay. Previous champions
Bal, Bruce and Marshall were
joined by freshman Matt McDon
ald to finish in 1:25.47.
"Matt really stepped up as a
freshman and had a great meet,"
Schnell said. "He did exactly what
we needed him to do."
