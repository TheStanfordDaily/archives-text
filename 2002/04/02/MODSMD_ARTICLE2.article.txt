## 
### GEORGE K. TONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While students are easing into spring
quarter, the Jewish Leadership Council of
Hillel is already busy with preparations for
Holocaust Remembrance Week, which
starts Monday, April 8.
Senior Rachel Davis, who helped orga
nize the events, said she believes there will
be strong campus support.
"I think the tense situation in Israel
right now will compel people to turn out
and learn something about the Holocaust
and about the racial persecution that led to
the formation of the state of Israel," she
said. Organizers have planned three days
of talks and film screenings.
"This year, [the week] is about putting
remembrance of this unspeakable crime
into a relevant and current context," said
sophomore Lizzi Heydemann. "Injustice,
senseless cruelty, murder and genocide

are not things of the past."
One of the week's highlights will be a
discussion by a Holocaust historian and a
Holocaust survivor titled "Making the
Links: Holocaust, Racism and Injustice
Today," Tuesday, April 9, at Toyon
Lounge from 7 to 9 p.m.
The event will feature speakers Lani
Silver, who is a Holocaust oral historian
of 20 years, and Helen Farkas, an
Auschwitz survivor and author of "A
Memoir of Survival."
Silver, who has coordinated 1,700 in
terviews with Holocaust survivors and
who is currently the project director for
the national James Byrd Jr. Racism Oral
History Project, explained the focus of her
portion of the talk.
"The event will be a time to think about
social injustice," Silver said. "It will be a time
to explore what one can do to end racism."
In her talk, Silver said she plans to
place the Holocaust into perspective by

relating it to contemporary issues of
racism, diversity and genocide. Farkas
will then complement Silver's presenta
tion with her personal experiences as a
Holocaust survivor. .
Fhe event, which falls on Yom
HaShoah, the international Holocaust Re
membrance Day, was first conceived by
the LduCulture Committee of the Jewish
Leadership Council.
Fhe council will pass out yellow ribbons
in White Plaza next Monday and Tuesday.
Monday night, the council will also
screen the 1991 film "Europa, Europa"
Monday night at 7 p.m. in Roble
Lounge in partnership with the Stan
ford Film Society.
Following the presentations by Silver
and Farkas on Tuesday, there will be a
name-reading vigil and memorial ceremo
ny in White Plaza to honor those who died
in the Holocaust.
"We will be in the birdcage reading

names until midnight, and students may
come and read for 10-minute shifts when
ever it's convenient for them," Heyde
mann said. "It is usually a very powerful
communal experience."
l he week's events will conclude with a
screening of "Life is Beautiful" on
Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. in Bran
ner Lounge.
Heydemann said she expects a high
level of student interest.
"In the past, the Holocaust Remem
brance Day at Stanford was commemorat
ed only with a service and name reading in
White Plaza on the night of Yom
1 laShoah," Heydemann said. "This year,
because we are pushing to make Yom
HaShoah a more widely approachable
and relevant experience for everyone, we
expect a much bigger turnout, hopefully
composed of Jews and non-Jews."
The week's events are being underwrit
ten bv the Dean of Students for Multicul

tural Affairs, the Black Community Ser
vices Center, the Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Community Resource Cen
ter, the Women's Community Center,
Murray, which is the theme house for
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnici
ty, the Jewish Women's Collective and a
Hillel Foundation Grant.
"We must approach this discussion with
a universal angle and identify with these
groups," Silver said.
The sponsors are especially appropri
ate in that they reflect a common experi
ence of plight and discrimination, accord
ing to Silver.
"I trust the Holocaust Remembrance
Week will greatly contribute to the cam
pus," Davis said. "By remembering the in
justices of the Holocaust and learning
more about the individual players and his
toric events involved, we can work togeth
er towards a future that prevents persecu
tion around the world."
