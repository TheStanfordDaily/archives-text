### 
ATLANTA(AP) —Maryland didn't play like Mary
land iintil it mattered. Now the Terrapins are nation
al champions.
With All-American guard Juan Dixon snapping
out of a scoring drought just in time, Maryland ended
Indiana's magical tournament run with a 64-52 vic to
ry Monday night.
This was the Terrapins' first appearance in a na
tional championship game and the senior-laden line
up came through over the final 9:42, pulling away
from the Hoosiers to become the fourth consecutive
No. 1 seed and eighth in the last 10 years to win it all.
Cloach Gary Williams brought his alma mater from
the depths of probation 13 years ago to the pinnacle
of college basketball. The man considered among the
most intense in the game was able to celebrate with his
team, which featured four players who had started at
least 100 games in their careers.
"We had to really grind it," Williams said. "It
took us a good 25 minutes before we really ran our
offense."
Dixon scored at least 27 points in four of the first

five tournament games, including 33 in the semifinal
victory over fellow top seed Kansas. He started the
title game at that pace, scoring 11 points in the open
ing 10 minutes. Ile didn't score again for 20 minutes.
When he hit a 3-pointer with 9:42 to play, it
gave Maryland (32-4) the le;ul for good at 45-44
and the Terrapins made sure even a small lead was
safe this time.
"1 was trying to be patient.," he said. "1 was trying
to let the game come to me. 1 hit a big shot."
Dixon finished with 18 points and he and fel
low senior Lonny Baxter combined for all the
points in the 9-2 run that Dixon started with the 3
and Baxter ended with a dunk that made it 51-46
with 7:22 to play.
Indiana (25-12), which upset top-seeded Duke,
then shocked second-seeded Oklahoma in the semifi
nals, just couldn't come up with another stunner.
i lie team that had the country almost forgetting
about Bob Knight again used the 3-point shot as its
main weapon.
The Hoosiers, who were 23-for
-32 from behind the arc in the re
gional final against Kent State and
Oklahoma, made eight of their
first 12 Monday night. When
Jared Jeffries' layup was goaltend
ed with 9:53 left, Indiana had its
only lead of the game, 44-42.
When Dixon and Baxter, who
finished with 15 points and 14 re
bounds, stepped up, the long shots
stopped falling. Indiana made just
two of its 11 shots from behind the
arc and its dream of being the first
No. 5 seed to win a national cham
pionship and match Kansas in
1988 for the most losses by a cham
pion started to fade.

Kyle Hornsby led Indiana with
14 points and Dane Fife added 11.
Jeffries, the Big Ten's player of the
year, finished with eight points on
4-for-11 shooting. The Hoosiers
finished 20-for-58 from the field
(34.5 percent), the first time in the
tournament they shot below 50
percent.
The Terrapins, who won 19 of
their last 20 games, again were big
on the boards, finishing with a 42-
31 rebound advantage.
Maryland was among the coun
try's highest-scoring teams at 85
points per game, but its third-low
est total of the season was good
enough to make it the 33rd school
to win the national championship
and the second straight from the
Atlantic Coast Conference, follow
ing Duke last season.
The loss was the first for Indi
ana in six national championship

game appearances. The last three
titles — 1976, 1981 and 1987— _
were won under Knight, who was
fired two years ago for violating a
zero-tolerance policy. Mike Davis,
one of his assistants, was selected to
succeed him and in just his second
season, he almost won it all.
Dixon didn't miss a shot in the
first half, going 4-for-4 from the
field and 2-for-2 from the free
throw line. His last shot came with
10:02 left and the baseline jumper
gave the Terrapins a 21-11 lead.
Indiana's first 14 points came
on four 3-pointers, two by
Coverdale, and two free throws.
The Hoosiers couldn't get a shot
off in the paint and had to settle for
outside shots.
After Drew Nicholas made two
free throws to give Maryland a 25-
16 lead with 7:59 left, the Terrap
ins missed eight straight shots.
