ATLANTA(AP) â€”Maryland didn't play like Mary
land iintil it mattered. Now the Terrapins are nation
al champions.
With All-American guard Juan Dixon snapping
out of a scoring drought just in time, Maryland ended
Indiana's magical tournament run with a 64-52 vic to
ry Monday night.
This was the Terrapins' first appearance in a na
tional championship game and the senior-laden line
up came through over the final 9:42, pulling away
from the Hoosiers to become the fourth consecutive
No. 1 seed and eighth in the last 10 years to win it all.
Cloach Gary Williams brought his alma mater from
the depths of probation 13 years ago to the pinnacle
of college basketball. The man considered among the
most intense in the game was able to celebrate with his
team, which featured four players who had started at

"We had to really grind it," Williams said. "It
took us a good 25 minutes before we really ran our
offense."
Dixon scored at least 27 points in four of the first

five tournament games, including 33 in the semifinal
victory over fellow top seed Kansas. He started the
title game at that pace, scoring 11 points in the open

When he hit a 3-pointer with 9:42 to play, it
gave Maryland (32-4) the le;ul for good at 45-44
and the Terrapins made sure even a small lead was
safe this time.
"1 was trying to be patient.," he said. "1 was trying
to let the game come to me. 1 hit a big shot."
Dixon finished with 18 points and he and fel
low senior Lonny Baxter combined for all the
points in the 9-2 run that Dixon started with the 3
and Baxter ended with a dunk that made it 51-46
with 7:22 to play.
Indiana (25-12), which upset top-seeded Duke,
then shocked second-seeded Oklahoma in the semifi
nals, just couldn't come up with another stunner.

about Bob Knight again used the 3-point shot as its
