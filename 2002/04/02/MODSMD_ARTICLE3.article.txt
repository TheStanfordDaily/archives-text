Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Robert Horn, a constitutional law
expert who retired in 1979, died
from natural causes on March 5 at
his Palo Alto home. He was 85.
Horn was perhaps most fa
mous for his book "Groups and
the Constitution," a 1956 pio
neering work on the Supreme
Court that explored interest
groups' roles and the way the
court reaches decisions. At Stan
ford, he also left a great mark
through his teaching.
'1 think that it is unfortunate
that the ideological bias in the so
cial sciences is so strong toward
the left," Horn once said. "If lib
erals aren't challenged sufficient

ly, if there aren't enough conser
vatives to challenge them, then
liberalism, I think, gets very weak
and waffly."
Bill McCraw, '57, a political
science and humanities professor
at San Jose State, said "It was not
enough that you learned what
was in the book or what some
body else thought; (Horn) made
students think."
Horn influenced and inspired
many of his students to go on to ca
reers in public office and academia.
"I would not have gone into the
[U.S.] Senate without him," said
Sen. Max Baucus, '63, D-Mont.
"He changed my life."
"I'm very proud to perpetuate
his legacy," said Do Paul University
political science professor David
Barnum, '64.

Barnum said Horn inspired
him to pursue a career teaching
constitutional law. "He loved
teaching and he loved his stu
dents. He loved to help people get
it right."
Born in Greenville, Ohio,
Horn earned his bachelor's in his
tory from Ohio Wesleyan Univer
sity in 1937. He was awarded a
master's and doctorate in political
science at Princeton in 1939 and
1942, respectively
Horn worked in the Informa
tion and Education Division of
psychological warfare during
World War II and later served in
the Korean War.
He joined t he Stanford 112 aculty
in 1953 after stints at Harvard,
the University of Chicago and
Sophia University in Japan.

Horn received the Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel Award in 1970. The
award is given each year fora "dis
tinctive contribution to under
graduate education."
Horn was widely known as a
conservative and traditionalist in a
predominantly liberal and behav
iorist political science faculty.
"What was most important
was that you thought and you
could arrive at a position you
could support and defend," said
Sen. Ron VVyden, '71, D-Ore.
"To this day, i can hear his voice
for approaching issues in a
thoughtful way."
Horn, who never married, is
survived by a nephew, Michael
Sutton, of Westchester, Ohio.
