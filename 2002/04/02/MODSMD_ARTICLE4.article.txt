Former assistant dean Anne
Ninham Medicine died of compli
cations from diabetes in February.
She passed away in her home at
the age of 68.
Medicine was the first assistant
dean hired to recruit and advo
cate for Native American gradu
ate students at Stanford. During
her 16 years at the University,
she also co-directed the Native
American Cultural Center and
acted as an assistant dean at the
Medical School.
Medicine was "an extremely
generous person," said Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian, Alaska Na
tive and Native Hawaiian Pro
gram. "She opened her door to
everyone. There was always
room on her couch. Sometimes I
think we forget those kinds of
things. There really were no
strangers to Anne."
Medicine came to Stanford in
1981, at a time when nobody
knew how to recruit Native Amer
ican students, Woodward said.
She "made a real difference," said
Winona Simms, assistant dean of
student's and the director of the
American Indian, Alaska Native
and Native Hawaiian Program,
who considers Medicine a "pio
neer" in her area of work.
"She had an influence way be
yond Stanford's campus," Simms
said. Medicine, who was of
Seneca, Oneida and Mohawk her
itage, was born in Buffalo, N.Y.,
on June 1, 1934. After graduating
from the Haskell Institute, a gov
ernment boarding school for Na
tive Americans in Lawrence, Kan.,
she went on to work as a lab tech
nician in Chicago. It was at that
time that Medicine became deeply
involved in Native American and
community issues, said her
daughter, Tara Wiley, who lives in

Palo Alto.
In Chicago, Medicine founded
a day school for Native American
children. She also worked along
side Jesse Jackson at Operation
Breadbasket, an organization
dedicated to improving economic
opportunities tor the black com
munity, Wiley said.
Medicine was already in her
3()s when she enrolled in gradu
ate school at Harvard University
to study education. At the time,
she was the single mother of four
young children. Medicine hadn't
earned a bachelor's degree, but
the university credited her for
her community work, according
to Wiley.
Al Harvard, she married Earl
Medicine. During those years,
remembered her daughter,
Medicine managed to juggle her
classes, coursework, and a
household of 11 â€”her own fami
ly, her husband's four children
and Wiley's grandmother, plus
two dogs. " I remember her being
up all night writing papers,"
Wiley said. "I don't know how
she did it."
Medicine earned a master's
degree in education and a certifi
cate of advanced study from
Harvard before joining her hus
band to operate a boarding
school for Native American
youth in South Dakota and a
ranch for Native American youth
in North Dakota. After divorcing
Earl Medicine, she worked in a
Native American health pro
gram in South Dakota.
Medicine's family had strug
gled and scraped to get by when
she was a young girl and it gave
her great satisfaction to see Native
Americans succeeding and get
ting an education, Wiley said.
According to Woodward, Med
icine played an integral role in
making this happen at Stanford,
