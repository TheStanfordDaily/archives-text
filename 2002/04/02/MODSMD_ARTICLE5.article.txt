# Manufacturing figures suggest start of strong economic recovery
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The notion
that the country's economic revival has
real staying power gained believers yes
terday when the latest snapshot of the
economy showed manufacturing growth
for the second straight month and con
struction spending recording its largest
increase in a year.
The Institute for Supply Manage
ment reported that its index of business
activity rose to 55.6 in March, its best
reading in two years, from 54.7 in Feb

ruary. An index above 50 signifies
growth in manufacturing, while a figure
below 50 shows contraction.
"There should be no doubt that manu
facturing has turned around sharply," said
economist Clifford Waldman of Waldman
Associates. "I think we have ourselves a
pretty broad economic recovery."
That's good news for the nation's belea
guered manufacturing sector, which was
suffering even before the country fell into
recession in March 2001. Hardest hit by

the sour economy, factories throttled back
production and laid off hundreds of thou
sands of workers.
But recent economic reports suggest
that factories are starting to boost produc
tion, particularly as companies have gotten
rid ofexcess piles of unsold goods, and that
bodes well for stronger economic growth
in the coming months, economists said.
"A factory rebound is clearly under
way, and I suspect that it will be quick
er and stronger than many expect,"

said Ken Mayland, president of
Clear View Economics.
"I'm a believer of the spring theory of
the economy. You compress it a little, it
bounces back a little. You compress it a lot,
it snaps back hard. Factories suffered their
worst setback in two decades, which sets
them up to come back with gusto," May
land said.
In another report, spending on con
struction projects grew by a bigger-than
expected 1.1 percent in February as

builders took advantage of Americans'
strong demand for new homes, the Com
merce Department said.
Virtually all the strength came from in
creased spending on residential construc
tion, which rose 3.5 percent, especially sin
gle-family homes.
Economists said the residential con
struction market should provide a nice
boost to economic growth for the first quar-
ter of this year. The reports also
suggest that the economy is grow
ing strong enough so as not to slip
back into a recession, a fear among
some analysts.
Even with mortgage rates
creeping up, economists still be

lieve home sales will remain solid
this year, helping along the eco
nomic recovery.
However, Monday's report
showed that spending on commer
cial projects, including industrial
complexes, office buildings and
hotels, declined by 3 percent in
February. Spending on big gov
ernment projects, including high
ways, dipped by 0.5 percent.
In trying to rescue the economy

from recession, the Federal Re
serve slashed interest rates 11
times last year, pushing some in
terest rates down to the lowest lev
els seen in four decades.
The Fed, citing signs of a turn
around, opted in January and in
March to hold interest rates
steady. Many economists believe
the Fed may begin to boost short
term interest rates as early as May
or June.
