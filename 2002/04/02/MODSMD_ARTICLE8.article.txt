On April 2, *963, The Daily
printed an article about the Uni
versity liberalizing its policy on
censorship and the formation of
student groups.
"The Board of Trustees, in
their March meeting, approved
the new constitution and issued a
policy statement concerning the
use of Stanford facilities for sectar
ian and partisan political activity.
"According to Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler, the
Trustee action came in response
to questions raised by renewed in
terest of students in their role at
the University, as evidenced by
the KPFA controversy and the
student body's passage of the new
constitution.
"Under the new constitution,
the Associated Students relin
quish the power to control the
formation of student groups on

campus. This action was part of a
concerted effort by students and
faculty, working through the Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com
mittee as well as the ASSU, to ob
tain a reevaluation of the Univer
sity's policies concerning partisan
political and sectarian activities
on campus.
"The KPFA issue crystallized
some of the problems involved
with the existing mechanism for
collective student expression. Stu
dents insisted they had a right to
speak out on public issues in spite
of Administration insistence that
existing regulations were sufficient
to prevent this.
"Trustee approval of the new
constitution acknowledged stu
dent desire to refrain from the
prior censorship of groups. The
policy statement that accompanied
the approval provides the machin

1963
ery for the formation of student
groups on campus. It also ac
knowledges the right of students
to express themselves collectively
on issues outside the university
community which might interest
them and provides a machinery
for this expression.
"The trustees policy states that
organizations
-in which membership is not
mandatory,
-whose membership is limited
to Stanford students and other
members of the Stanford Universi
ty community, and
-whose purposes and proce
dures are not inconsistent with the
goals and standards of the Univer
sity may form on campus.
Bottom Line: What exactly is the KPFA
issue? Regardless, students reap the
benefits today.
