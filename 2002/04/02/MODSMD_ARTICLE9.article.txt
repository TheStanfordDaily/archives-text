RAM ALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Is
raeli forces attacked Palestinian securi
ty headquarters near Ramallah early
today and headed toward Bethlehem,
Palestinians said, signaling further in
tensification of an offensive the Israelis
say is aimed at stamping out terrorism.
Israeli forces attacked the headquar
ters of Palestinian Preventive Security
outside Ramallah. They said Palestinian
security chiefjibril Rajoub had given or
ders to the 400 men inside to resist.
Palestinian officials said that Israeli
soldiers used 60 Palestinian civilians as
a human shield in front of the tanks be
fore the assault. Army spokesman Olivi
er Rafowicz "categorically denied" the
charges. Israel banned reporters from
the scene, and there was no indepen
dent confirmation.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres told MSNBC] that Israel does not
plan to occupy the Palestinian areas.

"We are in the territories lor three or
four weeks. We don't intend to occupy
the places," Peres said, adding that Is
rael does not intend to dismantle the
Palestinian Authority or harm Arafat.
Spurred by a wave of bloody suicide
attacks that claimed more than 40 lives
in five days, Israeli leaders said the mil
itary drive was meant to smash a Pales
tinian terrorist infrastructure. Palestini
ans, for their pail, said Israel's tactics
amounted to a campaign of state terror
against the civilian population.
As Israeli forces advanced, Palestin
ian militants were killing Palestinians
suspected of collaborating with Israel.
Ten bodies were found in the West
Bank, including seven taken by mili
tants from a temporary jail and shot in
the streets of Tulkarem.
In the sixth Palestinian attack in six
days, a car bomb exploded near down
town Jerusalem, killing the driver and a

policeman.
President Bush called on Arafat to
put a stop to anti-Israeli attacks. "There
will never be peace so long as there is
terror, and all of us must fight terror,"
Bush said.
Israeli soldiers, pressing ahead with
searches, broke down the doors of
homes in Ramallah and Qalqilya, Pales
tinians said.
"They smashed pictures that were on
the wall and looked everywhere, empty
ing closets and throwing around our
clothes," said 26-year-old Naliza Rouf,
who said soldiers spent about two hours
in her Ramallah house. Her 24-year-old
brother Niad was made to kneel mo
tionless while soldiers shouted questions
and abuse at him, the family said.
An 11-year-old Palestinian boy was
killed by gunfire from Israeli soldiers
as he played near a market in Rafah, in
the Gaza Strip, Palestinian hospital of

ficials said.
In Ramallah, nearly all the dead
over the course of the incursion — at
least 25, by Palestinian count — have
been men in their 20s and 30s.
Six foreigners protesting the Israeli
invasion were injured when they
marched up to tanks in Beit Jalla, said
doctors. One woman was hit in the
stomach by a bullet, and witnesses said
the others were struck by shrapnel after
an Israeli soldier fired into the ground.
State Department spokesman Philip
Reeker criticized Israel for injuring the
protesters and said the military should
investigate the incident to prevent such
incidents in the future.
Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb
Erekat accused Bush and the United
Nations of ignoring the Palestinians'
suffering. "There is total destruction,
total state terror against the Palestini
ans," Erekat told The Associated Press.
