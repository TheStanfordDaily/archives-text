## The 						Stanford Daily Language Division proposal is commendable 
### 
Published Since 1891

We commend the Provost, the
Deans of Humanities and Sci
ences and the Division of Lan
guages, Cultures and Litera
tures on their new plan for the division's fu
ture. The proposal to strengthen the divi
sional structure — while preserving the indi
vidual identity of each of the six language
and literature departments that comprise the
Division — is a bold step to raise the profile
of these disciplines on campus and of these
departments around the country.
The provost and the deans have also made
a strong financial commitment to maintain
and strengthen the division. The new cross
disciplinary research groups represent an
opportunity for professors from across the
division to collaborate. And the two new half-

time faculty positions that the Provost has
promised for the research groups represent
the commitment of the University to foster
ing these disciplines at Stanford.
The added central oversight the division
will possess over each individual department
is overdue. The small size of many of the de
partments has promoted infighting in the
past and the inability of some department
chairs to assert control over senior faculty has
led to irregular course offerings.
Many of these same reasons drove the
provost's plan to consolidate the six depart
ments last year. The current proposal is a
much better program for strengthening
these departments.
We congratulate the Blue Ribbon Com
mission that formulated the plan for listen

ing to student complaints about course offer
ings and the lack of vision for these depart
ments. We hope that some measure of cen
tralized control in the division's offices will
help make course offerings more plentiful,
predictable and desirable.
We are also pleased that the Provost has
promised to maintain the faculty strength of
the division as of} une 2001. This step will guar
antee the future vitality of the departments, es
pecially after the nine-month hiring freeze.
However, we see the guarantee of 43.5 fac
ulty members in the division not as a goal, but
as a baseline. With respect to competing insti
tutions, many of the departments in the divi
sion are drastically understaffed. In June
2001, many of these departments were also
coming off of a decade of sinking faculty

third of their faculty in the preceding decade.
We hope that the faculty searches that
were frozen will be carried out expeditiously,
and that new searches will be approved soon.

We believe that the promises of the pro
posal represent the beginning of a better
working relationship between the division,
the deans and the provost. We hope that all
parties will continue to work to build
strength in the study of literature and lan
guages at Stanford.
The proposal of the Blue Ribbon Commis
sion, hopefully, will noticeably enhance the
study of the humanities at Stanford, and will
not simply be a bureaucratic reorganization.
