# RUNNING ON EMPTY
## Penniless in paradise 
### 
As I write this (in my head, it'll go on
paper later), I am sprawled on the sand in
Waikiki, my pasty Irish skin glowing
tinder a thick coat of sunscreen strong
enough to deflect nuclear fallout. I have
applied the stuff everywhere, including
places I would ordinarily never touch in
public. If I expose even a sliver of flesh to
the sun, I will burn like a roasted pig, mak
ing my most personal bodily functions an
excruciating nightmare.
In front of me is a woman wearing a biki
ni made of shoelaces. The

woman herself seems to
have been assembled
from spare mannequin
parts. Her hair color, tan
and chest could not possi
bly have occurred in na
ture. She is slathering
sunscreen on a bronzed
blond man in places he

can definitely reach. Later, this woman will
readjust her beach mat, spraying sand in
every crevice of my face and giggle.
To my left, my right and all over the
beach are Stanford students. This week, the
week of our spring break, you cannot swing
a dead fish in Hawaii without hitting some
one in a Stanford sun visor. They are ev
erywhere — riding on mopeds with the
wind in their hair, gyrating at clubs looking
carefully shellacked and jumping out of
planes like MacGyver while waving video
cameras.
I have come to Hawaii with nine Stan
ford pals, three girls and six guys. Like our
plane-leaping, island-hopping counter
parts, we have come to bask in the warm,
healing glow of the tropical sun and fruity
beverages with little umbrellas in the glass.
Unlike them, most of us have already sold
our superfluous internal organs to pay for
the plane ticket. Not for us, gratuitous
spending. Not for us, three daily meals.
We are broke and proud of it.
Budget travel is not for those who can't
do without luxuries like cable TV or beds.
It means leaving through the fire escape
so that the motel manager doesn't catch
on that ten of us are staying in a four-per
son room. It means lots of meals eaten
with sporks.
None of this matters to us, of course, be
cause as the swaying palm trees and
sparkling turquoise waves continually re
mind us: We are in Hawaii! We are the
luckiest people alive. It does not matter if
we can't afford the cover for the hot night
club. It does not matter if we run out of toi
let pa|>er and are afraid to ask the front
desk for more. Nolxxly gonna break our
stride. Nolxxly gonna slow us down, oh no.
We got to keep on moving.
On the second day, offended by the in
flated prices of Hawaiian McDonalds, we
send two guys to the I lonolulu (iostco with
the task of feeding us fora week for pennies
a day. They return triumphantly lx*aring,
among other gtxxlies, ramen, family-sized
bologna variety packs, and ... a kite.
We watch as the kite is assembled in the
middle of the motel room fl<x>r by its giddy

purchaser, stunned both by the sheer size
of the thing and the questionable judgment
of bringing this object into a room where
sleeping bag space is debated like interna
tional boundaries.
The kite, a red-ancl-blue Kitty Hawk
style airplane, is as obnoxious and unwieldy
as a passed-out drunk. We mutter curses at
it until a windy day at the park when the
kite is flown, bringing us several minutes of
childlike joy before crashing spectacularly
to the ground. It is never used again.
This makes our group laugh. Lots of
things make us laugh, which is why we can
share a single toilet fora week and still not
squeeze necks when we put sunscreen on
each other's backs.
On the first night of the trip we take a
timed photo of ourselves snuggled together
on the flowered couch in our room, red
party cups aloft, giggling and glorying in
our young, enthusiastic, multicultural
selves. We are friends! Yeah college! Whoo!
By Day Three, the room has begun to
reek of used towels, spilled beer and KFC
leftovers. We cannot flip the "Do Not Dis
turb" sign, for fear the housekeeper will no
tice our 12 suitcases and blow our cover.
With one shower among us, we are al
most always dirty. leaving the group to
pursue a solo activity, such as shopping for
postcards or going to the lobby to use the
bathroom, is half-jokingly referred to as
"breaking free."
On Day Four we ditch the guys and
primp, push-up and paint ourselves for
Girls Night Out. We are in the cab heading
into Waikiki, flushed with anticipation and
Skyy, marveling in our female camaraderie
and independence — we are women, hear
us roar — when the cab driver casually
mentions that the street we're passing is a
favorite hangout for the soldiers stationed
here.
"Stop the car," we tell him.
It sounds a little skanky now. Maybe you
kind of had to be there. But although Stan
ford has palm trees and pineapple in the
dining halls, we do not have sailors. And
when you are on vacation, you should al
ways take time to appreciate the local cul
ture. To do otherwise is simply rude.
So we go to a few bars, play some darts,
are bought a round of drinks by an or
ange-skinned mustachioed man old
enough for the senior special at Denny's
and chat with some of the nice young men
serving our country.
As the night wears on we begin to stretch
the truth to keep ourselves entertained,
convincing less-alert marines that we are
sisters, Canadians and native speakers of
Japanese, and that I once killed a cow with
my bare hands.
It's almost time to go home. I am going
to miss the unljearably gorgeous scenery,
the gentle balmy breeze and the constant
companionship of nine genuinely delight
ful people. It has been a fabulous trip. But
damn, this nxmi stinks.
