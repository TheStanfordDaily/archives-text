There's nothing fallacious about being
pro-life
In response to Josh Sohn's Apr. 2 col
umn ("Pro-Life's fetus fallacy), some
points need to be made. Pro-life people,
myself included, do believe that human
life is, precious, from conception until
natural death. Any process which de
stroys such life is morally wrong. This
definitely includes abortion, but also in
cludes euthanasia and capital punish
ment. It is for this reason that we con
demn the murder of abortion doctors,
for that is also murder.
Sohn asks if pro-life people would
condemn the assassination of a Nazi ex
termination camp commander. Given
the circumstances that existed then,
most would probably not, because force
was all that could stop the Nazis. Diplo
macy failed miserably (Munich, 1938),
and military force was only successful
after a long and bloody war involving the
Russians, British, Americans, Canadians
and many other Allied countries.
In a similar vein, killing in self-defense
is not morally wrong as one seeks to pre
serve one's own life, so long as the killing
of another person is the only manner by
which one's own life can be saved.
However, in America today, there are
other ways of stopping abortion doctors,
besides killing them. Namely, laws can be
enacted to outlaw abortion. I bis simply
was not an option with the Holocaust.
Abortion clinics can be closed or con
verted to pregnancy counseling centers
where women can be helped in address
ing the issues which lead them to consid
er abortion in the first place.
In short, lethal force is morally wrong
because it is excessive and certainly not
the only means of ending abortion in
this country.
I would like to point out a few things

about abortion in "reasonable, logical
terms". An unborn child is not part of his
or her mother's body, but a separate being,
with his or her own distinct DNAcode.
To claim that abortion should be legal
because a woman should have control of
her body is fallacious, because a develop
ing fetus is not part of her body, but a
separate person.
Also, a developing fetus is human, just
as much as an infant, teenager, or
grownup is human. A fetus may be very
young and under-developed compared
to an infant, but an infant is under-de
veloped compared to a teenager.
The same'applies to a teenager in
comparison to a 50-year-old man. The
degree of development does not dimin
ish the value of one's life.
1 am as human today as I was one year
ago, 20 years ago, and 28 years ago,
when I was an unborn fetus.
Abortion certainly is a controversial
topic today. But when examined for
what it truly is, there can be no doubt
that it simply involves the destruction of
innocent, unborn, human life.

Luckovich cartoon accurate
In response to Rachelle Marshall's let
ter in yesterday's Daily, the Mike Luck
ovich cartoon is much more accurate
than one may think. The Saudi peace ini
tiative included, among its other de
mands, that Israel honor the Palestini
ans' "right of return" in to their homes in
pre-1948.
This in itself would eliminate Israel
from the Middle East. The only differ
ence it would make in the region is that,
instead of a few thousand Palestinians
within Israel, there would now be a few

million Palestinians, some of whom
would still commit suicide bombings.
The suicide bombings would not stop as
long as Jews still lived in the region.
Secondly, Sharon halted peace talks
in which Yasir Arafat rejected the best
proposal the Palestinians had been of
fered yet, only to return to the region
and start another intifada. This was
hardly Sharon's choice, as he was not
even prime minister at the time.
Finally, just as young Palestinians
have been "humiliated" and forced to
terrorism (which existed long before
1967) Israel has been forced to respond
to decades of suicide bombings and ter
rorist incursions by drastic measures.
One cannot claim the Palestinians have a
right to defend themselves through ter
ror targeted at civilians, yet Israel does
not have a right to defend itself through
military offenses targeted at terrorists.
