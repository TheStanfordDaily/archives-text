# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Pro-lifers who oppose murdering abortion doctors aren't hypocrites 
### DAVID CHAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
In his April 2nd column, Josh Solin
plays both sides against the middle by try
ing to trap mainstream pro-life doctrine
into support for unpopular abortion doc
tor attacks.
To achieve this rhetorical maneuver,
Sohn draws an emotional analogy be
tween abortion and the Holocaust. To his
credit, his words are sensational; howev
er, the analogy still falls flat on its face.
Sohn morally equates assassinating
Nazi concentration camp commanders
with murdering abortion doctors to save
fetuses if we accept the pro-life belief in
fetal humanity. As Sohn said, "(AJccording
to the mainstream pro-life perspective, the
same kind of state-sanctioned killing is
happening every day at abortion clinics.
After all, fetuses are no less human, and no
less worthy of being defended, than the
Jews of Nazi Germany." Then he decries
the supposed inconsistency.
Since most pro-lifers would support
Nazi assassinations, are they not hyp
ocrites for condemning equivalent abor

tion doctor assassinations? From this ob
servation, he concludes that pro-lifers
don't honestly believe in fetal human sta
tus and thus are hypocrites.
Let's now consider his claim that abor
tion constitutes unjust state-sanctioned
killing comparable to the Holocaust's
genocide. In the Holocaust, the Nazi
government itself rounded up everyone
of Jewish descent, confiscated their
property and possessions, shipped them
off to hard labor in concentration camps,
and there inhumanely slaughtered mil
lions of Jews —just for the systematic
and deliberate purpose of exterminating
their race.
On the other hand, there is no U.S.
government conspiracy to exterminate fe
tuses. Roe v. Wade may have allowed
women to seek abortions on their own,
but it did not prescribe government sup
port for aborting fetuses just for the sake
of destroying the lives of unborn humans.
In fact, abortion doctors are not agents
of the state executing an anti-fetal policy;
largely, they are concerned physicians
who believe they are supplying a needed
medical service to women.

Nazi concentration camp comman
ders, on the other hand, were only con
cerned with how many Jews they could
kill in the shortest period of time. Pre
sented properly, the two scenarios seem
hardly similar at all.
For the sake of argument, I've granted
Sohn his unsupported assumption that
the vast majority of Americans really
would support assassinations of Nazi camp
commanders (this is a very vulnerable as
sertion, but the frailty of Sohn's argument
hardly hinges on this objection). That just
shows that many Americans would be will
ing to kill evil men and women who were
unjustly committing genocide on a wide
scale for the express purpose of destroying
Jews if there were no other options are
available in time of war.
Are abortion doctors also evil men and
women who are committing genocide on
a wide scale for the express purpose of
destroying unborn humans? Hardly.
Even the pro-life proponents who believe
that abortion doctors are committing
murder (not all pro-lifers categorically
believe abortion is always murder) con
demn assassinating aforementioned doc

tors in vigilante fashion because that too
is unjust killing (murder).
In the abortion case, pro-life support
ers can and do push for political change
in the legal system against abortion while
there was no similar nonviolent alterna
tive to preventing the genocide of the
Holocaust during World War 11.
Where there is a peaceful alternative,
vigilante violence is simply gratuitous
and unjust; however, in the absence of
nonviolent alternatives in times of war,
assassinations of Nazis could be, not nec
essarily would be, morally acceptable (al
though simply destroying the concentra
tion camps and indicting Nazis at war
crimes tribunals would be far better).
The Holocaust was genocide — the
state-sponsored unjust slaughter of 6 mil
lion Jews by the German government.
From the pro-life perspective, abortion is
killing. Abortion, however, may or may
not be unjust killing (murder). But one
thing is sure; abortion, as it is practiced
now, is definitely not state-sponsored
genocide, nor is considered such by pro
life supporters.
If murder is not genocide, and conse

quently abortion cannot be equated with
the Holocaust's genocide, then Sohn's
supposed fallacy vanishes entirely. Simi
larly, while most people would excuse
killing in the name of preventing state
sponsored genocide during wartime in
t lie absence of nonviolent alternatives,
most Americans do not support the death
penalty for convicted serial killers, and
they would likely condemn vigilantes
who assassinate convicted serial killers
unjustly. By the same token, most Amer
icans would condemn vigilante murders
of abortion doctors.
In conclusion, it is Sohn who is cloud
ing I he abortion issue and ref using to dis
cuss abortion in reasonable and logical
terms. His clumsy analogy totally misses
the point — genocide and abortion are
not the same.
As a fellow pro-choice supporter, it
disappoints me that he would stoop to
misrepresenting the pro-life movement,
instead of attacking its logic directly.
