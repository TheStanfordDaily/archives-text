# Parents sue hospital for 'playing God'
## 
### 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — When Sidney
Ainsley Miller was born, she was small enough
to lit iu the palm of her father's hand. Her
eyes were fused, and her head was hardly big
ger than a golf ball.
Now, at age 1 1, she is blind and retarded, liv
ing in a painful world of contracted limbs and
seizures. She cannot walk, talk or feed herself.
She is also at the center of a legal dispute that
w ill be argued before the I exas Supreme Court
on today: Should hei parents have been grant
ed their wish to withhold treatment from the
baby? Or was the hospital obligated to do what
it could to keep her alive?
"This case is not about mercy killing," said
Sidney's father, Mark Miller. "This is a simple
consent case in which the hospital tried to play
God while not understanding that role has al
ready been filled."
Laws in most states are vague on the issue.
And Dr. Jean Steichert, who works in high-risk
infant follow-up at (Children's I lospital Medical
Center in Cincinnati, said the medical commu
nity is watching the case closely.
"There's going to be a precedent, because
there was a legal case for doctors to intervene
and there also was a basis for parental rights,"
Steichen said.

Sidney was born more than lour months
early, on Aug. 17,1990, at Women's I lospital in
I louston. Doc tors had warned the family that ii
Sidney lived, she faced a high risk of severe dis
abilities, and resuscitation could result in suf
fering for the child.
The Millers decided that "no heroic mea
sure's" should be taken to save her. The doctors
noted it in the lile.
I he hospital, however, concluded that
state and federal laws required resuscita
tion attempts for the girl. Its own policy
called for life-saving efforts for any child
born weighing at least 500 grams, or
about 18 ounces. An ultrasound indicat
ed Sidney weighed 629 grams.
Once Sidney was delivered, doctors
moved to keep the child alive. Because she
was born without fully developed lungs, doc
tors used a throat tube to pump oxygen into
her body.
The family says the treatment resulted in
brain hemorrhaging that left Sidney severely
disabled and needing 24-hour care that already
has cost more than $1 million. Hospital officials
say the disabilities resulted from severe internal
injuries unrelated to the resuscitation.
I he Millers sued the hospital and its parent,

Columbia/ HCA Healthcare Corp., for negli
gence and battery. A jury awarded the Millers
$00 million in 1998.
fhe verdict was overturned by an appeals
court, which said the parents could have re
fused treatment only if the baby's condition had
been terminal.
In appealing their case to the Texas
Supreme Court, the Millers say state and com
mon law allowed them to withhold treatment.
Under the Texas Family Code, parents have
"the right to consent" to a child's medical care.
But HCA argued in court papers that once
the child was born, the Family Code entitled
her to receive medical care that would allow
her to live.
Several Houston-area Baptist and Jewish
leaders have sided with the Millers, arguing the
court should protect the sanctity of the family.
Activists for the disabled say a ruling in
favor of the parents could lead to the with
holding of medical treatment for the handi
capped to weed out the imperfect. They have
rallied behind the hospital.
"We're concerned that we'd all be oiled be
cause of our disability," said Bob Kafka,
founder of ADAPT of Texas, an activist group
for the disabled.
