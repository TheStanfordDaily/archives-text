RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)—ls
rael seized control of Bethlehem and an
other West Bank town yesterday in a day
of wild fighting that left at least 13 Pales
tinians dead. Palestinian gunmen forced
their way into tlie Church of the Nativity
and Israeli tanks and helicopters pound
ed the headquarters of a Palestinian se
curity chief.
Amid the fiercest Israeli offensive in
18 months of conflict, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat angrily rejected an Israeli
offer to free him from confinement in
his compound in the West Bank town ol
Ramallah — provided lie goes into
exile. Arafat spent a fifth straight day
pinned down by Israeli troops and
tanks, his compound now ringed by
barbed wire.
Israeli troops pressed ahead with house-to

house searches lor Palestinian militants and
weapons as part (>fwhat Israel calls "()peration
Protective Wall" — aimed at halting terror at
tacks targeting Israelis.
In the seventh such attack in as many
days, a Palestinian man blew himself up
last night when security forces stopped
him at a checkpoint in Baka al-Sharkiyeh,
a Palestinian village along the line between
Israel and the West Bank. The man deto
nated explosives strapped around his
body, killing himself but not injuring oth
ers, the military said.
Holy places were not immune
from violence that raged the length
and breadth of the West Bank.
Do/ens of armed Palestinians were
holed up inside the Church of the
Nativity in Bethlehem, which is built
over the grotto where tradition says

Jesus was born. About 20 of the gun
men were wounded and being tend
ed to by nuns, according to witness
es trapped in the church compound.
The armed men, some of them Pales
tinian policemen, forced their way into the
church after running battles with Israeli
troops firing from helicopter gunships
and from tank-mounted machine guns. At
nightfall, the bodies of four gunmen lay
sprawled just off Manger Square, where
the church is located.
As ihe fighting intensified, Prime Min
ister Ariel Sharon proposed publicly for
the first time that diplomats fly Arafat into
exile. Sharon noted such a move would re
quire Cabinet approval. Arafat denounced
the suggestion, saying he would rather be
a "martyr" than go into exile.
Throughout the conflict, much has

been made of Sharon and Arafat's bitter
personal enmity, which many observers
see as a driving force behind the lighting.
"These two people have lived this con
flict fora very long time — too long if you
ask me," European Union security chief
Javier Solana said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
said the offensive would last three to four
weeks, the first senior Israeli official to give
a time frame. I lowever, Sharon has said
the campaign was open-ended.
In Washington, Secretary of State
Colin Powell said Israel should end the
campaign quickly, but suggested the
United States would not insist on an im
mediate Israeli withdrawal. "I would
guess it will take them [the Israelis] a cou
ple of weeks" to conclude the mission,
Powell said on NBC's "Today" show. Pow

ell expressed opposition to expelling
Arafat. "Until he decides he's going to
leave the country, it seems we need to
work with him where he is."
Powell also spoke to Jordanian Prime
Minister Ali Abul-Ragheb, who told him
that Israeli aggression was threatening
the stability of the region, the Petra news
agency said.
The Suite Department, citing a "deteri
orating security situation," warned Amer
icans to defer travel to Israel, the West
Bank and Gaza and said dependents of
American diplomats in Jerusalem were
being encouraged to go home. Similar
warnings to Americans to stay away from
Israel were issued in December and Janu
ary. Americans living in Jerusalem, the
West Hank and in Gaza were advised to
consider relocating.
