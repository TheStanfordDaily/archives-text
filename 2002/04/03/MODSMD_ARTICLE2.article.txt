### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
Talk about a Renaissance
Man: as of this quarter, Chem
istry Prof. Carl Djerassi will as
sume emeritus status after 42
years of teaching at Stanford, in
part to pursue a career in the
dramatic arts.
"1 want to continue teaching,"
Djerassi said. "As a professor
emeritus 1 will still be able to, but

I can work it
around my
sched u 1 e . "
Djerassi, 78, is
famous for his
work in various
areas of chem
istry, including
inventing the
first oral contra-

ceptive. Now he will devote him
self to writing plays in the genre of
"science-i nt heat er."
For the past five years, Djerassi
has Ix-en working on plays that use
fictk)n "as a means of sn nlggliiig sci
entific culture, behavior and idio
syncrasies into an a-scientific, unin
terested public," Djerassi said.
Already experienced in mix
ing these two concepts, Djerassi
has written several books in the
genre of "science-in-fiction" that
deal with similar subjects in a lit
erary, instead of a dramatic
medium. These include "Can
tor's Dilemma," "ICSI," "Oxy
gen" and "This Man's Pill."
"My bridge is a special literary
genre, science-in-fiction, where
in I illuminate in a projected
tetralogy of novels the tribal cul
ture of scientists, rather than
dwelling on the science they do.
The reception of the first vol
ume, 'Cantor's Dilemma,' which

addresses these issues, convinced
me that science-in-fiction is an ef
fective way of smuggling serious
topics of scientific behavior into
the consciousness of the scientifi
cally illiterate."
In addition to his dramatic pur
suits, Djerassi has an intense sched
ule of lectures and appearances
planned until October in lx)th the
United States and Europe.
()n Monday, he gave a lecture
in Palo Alto titled, "Science-in
t heater — a neglected genre."
1 lie lecture related to his current
pursuit of playwriting.
Djerassi's next piece, "Insuf
ficiency," will deal with male
impotency. He is also revising
his third play, "Calculus,"
which deals with the Newton-
Leibniz rivalry over who first
discovered calculus.
Other topics he will cover in
clude the future of reproduction
after technological advances and
the role of the theatrical form in
the scientific classroom.
To this end, Djerassi will be
appearing with Belinda Fu, a
human biology professor, at
Stanford's Academic Exposi
tion during Admit Weekend,
to present the pedagogic play
"Sex in an Age of Mechanical
Reproduction."
This presentation won him
both laughter and applause last
quarter from 200 students, when
he performed it during a Feb. 19
human biology lecture.
Djerassi is one of the few
American chemists to have been
awarded both the National
Medal of Science, for the first syn
thesis of an oral contraceptive in
1951, and the National Medal of
Technology, for promoting new
approaches to insect control.
