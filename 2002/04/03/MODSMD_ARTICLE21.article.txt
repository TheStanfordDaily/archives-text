### SARAH LINDSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he members of Stanford's
women's gymnastics team had the
same finals stress as everyone else
during finals week last quarter, but
they also had to fit in their last gru
eling practices for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, held
in Maples Pavilion on March 23.
No. 10 Stanford (13-5,9-3 Pac
-10) placed third in the conference
with a score of 196.150, leaving the
Cardinal behind No 1 UCLA
(197.625) and No. 12 Arizona
(197.050).
Despite not winning the Pac-1()
crown, the Cardinal competed
with incredible enthusiasm.
"It is always a hard meet be
cause we were just coming off of fi
nals week, and we had been hav
ing demanding workouts for the
past two weeks, as well," said ju
nior Alissa Cooper. "So all things
considered, we had great energy
as a team."
The Cardinal started the night
on (lie floor. Sophomores Lind
say Wing and Lise Leveille led
Stanford with 9.900 to tie for sev
enth place.
"Lindsay is coming along beau
tifully," said head coach Kristen
Smyth. "She has competed in the
all-around in three meets so far,
and she is coming around at just
the right time."
l he next event for the Cardinal
was the vault, where sophomore
Kendall Beck led Stanford with a
9.900, taking eighth place.

On the bars, Leveille led the
Cardinal with a 9.850.
"Lise is another member of the
team who is making several im
provements to help lead us in
these final meets," Smyth said.
Stanford closed the competi
tion on the beam, where Wing and
Leveille finished in a four-way tie
for first place on the event. The
Cardinal gymnasts posted a 9.900,
while senior Katy I lerbert tied for
eighth place with a 9.850.
While Stanford was fatigued
and tired from an intense week
and a tough meet, the team main
tained its focus enough to avoid
any falls.
UCLA dominated the meet,
capturing the overall team title on
floor, bars and beam, while Ari
zona took first on the vault.
In the all-around, Bruin ju
nior Onnie Willis finished first
with a 39.625, and UCI-A sopho
more Jamie Dantzscher placed
second with a 39.575. Dantzscher
was named the Pac-10 Oymnast
of the Year.
Stanford freshman Mandy Del
gado was named Pac-10 Co-Fresh
man of the Year along with Ari
zona's Katie Johnson.
Stanford placed 10 gymnasts
on the Pac-10 All-Academic
Teams. To be qualified for selec
tion to the team, a student-athlete
must have at least a 3.0 overall
grade point average and be either
a starter or significant substitute.
