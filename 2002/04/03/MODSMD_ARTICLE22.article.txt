# Wrestling wraps up successful season
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Under the guidance of first-year
head coach Steve Buddie, the Stan
ford wrestling team had three main
goals heading into this season: to
have a winning record, to have sev
eral 20-win wrestlers and to qualify
at least three wrestlers to the NCAA
tournament.
Check, check, and check.
'Fhe team finished 10-8 for its 112 irst
winning season in 11 years, four
wrestlers topped the 20-win mark
and the Cardinal qualified four
wresders for the NCAA Champi
onships in Albany, N.Y., from
March 21 to March 23.
It was there that Stanford's sea
son came to an end, as all good
things do.
Senior Levi Weikel-Magden,
sophomore Nathan Peterson and
redshirt freshmen Brad Metzler
and Matt Gentry represented the
Cardinal in Albany. All four had
qualified for college wrestling's ul
timate competition at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships in
early March.
In his first bout of the double
elimination tournament, Metzler
(141 pounds) was pinned by ()kla
homa's Nate Parker. Despite a
stronger showing in his second
bout, he was eliminated later in
the day after dropping a 5-2 dec i

sion to Pac-10 foe Brian Watson of
Oregon.
At 157 pounds, Weikel-'Magden
also made an early exit. Following a
narrow 9-7 defeat to Clarion's Jere
my Reitz in his first action of t he day,
the fifth-year senior sullered a loss
by technical fiill to Gabe Webster of
(Cornell.
"For Levi, I think getting there
was extremely important," Bud
die said. "He worked so hard and

showed such remarkable im
provement that the reward of an
NCAA Championship berth was
well deserved."
Despite failing to earn a win at
the NCAAs, Weikel-Magden's final
season on the Farm was the best of
his career. His 27 wins — second
only to Gentry's Stanford freshman
record of 35 — included 13 in dual
meets and three pins.
After dropping their first bouts,

Gentry and Peterson ensured that
the Cardinal's appearance was not a
winless one.
Peterson lost to No. 12 seed
Twan Pham of Illinois, 3-1, al 125
pounds before pinning Lock
I laven's Trap McCormack at 1:59.
Gentry lost to No. 11 seed Jer
rod Sanders of Oklahoma State, 8-
1, in the first round. But against the
Citadel's Wayne Watts, Gentry
showed the form that made him
the Cardinal's point leader during
the regular season, posting an 1 1-5
decision.
However, neither of Stanford's
final two wrestlers made it past the
second day of competition.
Peterson, who tallied four pins
during the regular season, was
pinned by No. 2 seed Leroy Vega of
Minnesota at 2:25.
Although his season was inter
rupted by a hand injury, he still
managed 24 wins overall and com
piled an 8-2 record in dual meets.
George Mason's Adrian Austin
proved too much to handle tor Cien
try, whose season came to an end
with a 6-3 defeat.
"While 1 think we were capable
of doing more at the champi
onships, 1 think that our showing
was about on par with our 'grand
plan'," Buddie said. "Next year, we
should qualify more wrestlers and
