## 
### ASHLEY ENSIGN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Norton, Mass., isn't exactly a spring
break hot spot, bin that's where the mem
bers of the Stanford synchronized swim
ming team found themselves the first
weekend after finals.
The trip was all business, though, as
the Cardinal competed at U.S. Colle
giate Championships at Wheaton Col
lege, which hosted 22 schools and over
200 athletes.
The three-day competition was a battle
to the bitter end. When the dust settled,
the Cardinal finished the season in second
place, behind rival ()hio State.
Stanford looked very strong across the
board in the preliminary round. Hut after
the second day of competition, these
scores were erased and only the final
scores on the third flay mattered.

Stanford's soloist, sophomore Katie
Norris, had a spectacular swim, scoring
95.8'W points to tie for first with Ohio
State's Carolina Moraes. Norris's place
ment was a big upset for the Cardinal, as
Moraes has won the solo competition for
the past two years.
"Katie's performance was amazing,"
said junior Stephanie JoukofF. "1 have
never seen her swim like that."
Stanford senior Lindsey Wigginton
and sophomore Erin Dobratz paired to
take silver in the duet competition behind
first place finishers Moraes and her twin
sister, Isabella.
The Moraes twins have won the duet
competition for the past three years and
won again this year, as expected. I'he two
placed 12th in the duet competition at the
2000 ()lympics for Brazil.
Stanford's second duet of junior
Stephanie JoukofF and sophomore Jen

niter Kibler also performed well in the
final competition, improving on their
fifth-place score in the preliminary round
to take third in the final.
Stanford took a two-three finish in the
trio competition, as well. Ohio States
Mary Hofer joined the Monies twins to
take the gold for the fourth consecutive
year. The Cardinal took silver and bronze
as the team of Wigginton, Dobratz and
Norris finished second, and the team ol
JoukofF, Kibler and freshman Sheila
Sadovnik finished third.
The competition culminated with the
team routine, the most important part <>l
the meet. Stanford and Ohio State tied in
the preliminary round on the second day
of competition, but the Buckeyes man
aged to capture the gold in the final
round on day three.
