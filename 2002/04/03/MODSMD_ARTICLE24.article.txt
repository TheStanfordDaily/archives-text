# Track turns in strong showing at home
## Many Cardinal athletes post NCAA qualifying and provisional marks 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
Most athletes work all season
long, waiting for that perfect meet
where everything comes together
to attain a qualifying mark for the
NCAA championships.
Many Cardinal athletes, howev
er, seemed a bit impatient, and
snagged NCAA provisional and
automatic qualifying marks in the
very first meet of the outdoor track
season â€” the Stanford Invitational.
The Invitational was held
March 29 and March 30 at Cobb
Track and Angell Field and saw
record-breaking attendance.
In addition to many collegians
from across the country, the
meet featured hundreds of high
school and post-collegiate ath
letes, making fora very large
field that required multiple heats
for each event.
Stanford's representatives,
many of whom were coming off of
injury or returning from the in
door season, did not disappoint
the large crowd.
Far and away the strongest Car
dinal performance was in the
men's 10,000 meters.
Sophomore Don Sage, typical
ly a middle-distance runner, dis
played his strength and versatili
ty by placing third in a very
strong field.
Sage finished right on the
heels of Notre Dame's Ryan
Shay, last year's NCAA champion
in the event. Sage's time of 28
minutes 40.12 seconds earned
him an automatic bid to the
NCAA Championships.
Junior Louis Luchini also had
an outstanding race, finishing
sixth and posting another NCAA
automatic qualifying time of
28:49.86.
J list six seconds off the automat

ic standard, sophomore lan Dob
son ran a provisional time of
29:06.41, placing 16th.
Every Cardinal runner posted a
time under 30 minutes, a remark
able teat. Dobson was followed by
junior Adam Tenforde (29:11.18,
20th), sophomore Chris Emme
(29:37.38, 24th) and senior Daniel
Parris (29:50.39, 28th).
Other highlights included
Jonathan Stevens's seventh-place
time of 1:53.41 in the 800 meters.
Stevens was spiked in his Achilles
tendon at last year's Penn Relays,
and lost a year to the injury.
Senior Jesse Thomas, another
athlete who has not seen any action
since last year's track season,
placed eighth with a time of
8:55.34 in the 3,000-meter steeple
chase, the event in which he is the
current Pac-10 champion.
The Cardinal, known mostly for
its strength in running events, was
also well represented in the jumps.
Junior Milton Little took sev
enth in the longjump with a mark
of 22 feet, 4 3/4 inches, while junior
Warrick McDowell took a seventh
place finish in the triple jump,
recording a mark 0f47-00 3/4.
Senior Ray Bergstrom placed
fourth in the high jump with a
jump of 6-07 3/4, giving the Cardi
nal much-needed depth in the
event with the absence of injured
senior Michael Ponikvar.
Displaying its strength across all
types of events, the Cardinal post
ed some high performances in the
throws, with junior Omer Inan
taking third in the discus (178-08)
and junior Nick Welihozkiy plac
ing ninth in the hammer throw
(190-01).
The Stanford women added
several NCAA-qualifying perfor
mances of their own.
Senior Caroline Annis took
13th in the women's 10,000 meters
with a time of 34:09.40, just 0.6
seconds under the NCAA auto
matic standard.
Less than one second behind
Annis was junior Erin Sullivan,
whose time of 34:10.32 barelv

missed the automatic time of
34:10. Sullivan's provisional quali
fying time, however, will almost
certainly be good enough to get
her into the NCAAs.
Sophomore thrower jillian
Camarena, who had a stellar in
door season capped by a fifth

place finish in the shot put at na
tionals, placed fourth in the event
with an NCAA automatic mark of
53-10 1/4.
The shot put is Camarena's
main strength, but she also threw
