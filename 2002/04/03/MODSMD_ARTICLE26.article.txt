# Fans riot in Maryland, Indiana after NCAA final
## 
### 
COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) —Stu-
dents lighted bonfires, threw bottles,
climbed onto business roofs and shot off
fireworks alter Maryland beat Indiana in
the NCAA championship game.
One reveler was tackled by an icecream
shop employee after trying to ram a police
barricade through the shop's window. An
other student was badly cut after getting
hit in the head with a bottle.
Bonfires grew in several areas as items
were tossed onto the blazes by students
milling about.
Police were deployed in force Monday
night, hoping to avoid a repeat of the vio
lence that followed Maryland's semifinal
victory over Kansas on Saturday night. Po
lice promised to "aggressively arrest" peo
ple who refused to disperse.
" This is terrible. We've finally started to
lose the reputation as the Len Bias death
school, and now we're known as the riot
school," said student Josh Fingold, 21, re
ferring to the 1986 cocaine overdose death
of the Maryland basketball star.
At one bonfire, police moved in on
horseback, circling the blaze to make room
for police on foot and a fire truck that ex
tinguished the blaze.
Nearby, a student threw a board at offi
cers, who responded by firing pepper
spray pellets.
On a side street, rioters smashed the
window of a bicycle store. Some rode off,
while others carried off bicycles for about
15 minutes before police arrived and
sealed off the store. Others in the crowd
then started grabbing bikes from looters
and returned some to the store.
Authorities said they planned to clamp
down on the bonfires, which did signifi
cant damage last year after Maryland lost
to Duke in the Final Four, said university
police spokeswoman Maj. Cathy Atwell.
One fire caused an estimated $500,000 in
damage and disrupted cable service when
it burned through a fiber optic line.
In Bloomington, Ind., police fired tear
gas into a crowd of Indiana fans when stu
dents began throwing bottles at officers

who waded into 11 it* c rowd to clear a path
lor (ire c rews to put out a small blaze.
Alter the tear gas was fired, hundreds of
students lied from the area near the edge
of campus. Police were seen making scat
tered arrests. A lew minor injuries were re
ported, the most severe a man who fell un
conscious man after being hit in the head
with a brick.
With students back from spring break
Monday, Maryland olficials feared post
game celebrations could be even wilder
than Saturday, when police in riot gear
squared off against a crowd ofabout 2,000.
Fans also threw beer botdes, tipped
down street signs, broke store windows
and trashed two police cruisers during the
three-hour melee that spilled into early
Sunday morning. Police, who drove stu
dents from the streets around 1 a.m. using
pepper spray, arrested two people.
Hundreds of red-clad fans filled the
seats at Cole Field House on Monday for
the last Maryland game seen at the historic
arena, watching the game on a huge tele
vision screen. Cole is slated to be replaced
next year by a larger building.
Fans mobbed the floor as it became
clear in the last few minutes that Maryland
was going to win, but the scene was joyous
and not raucous.
In downtown College Park, city work
ers removed street signs Monday along
with "anything that could be used as a mis
sile," according to Joe Nagro, the city's
deputy public works director.
School olficials also planned to enforce
a recent change in the university's code of
conduct, which allows the school to disci
pline any students who ate arrested off
campus for misdemeanors.
Several students were arrested on mis
demeanor charges after last year's Final
Four incident, but the school's code of con
duct only allowed punishment for
felonies, said university spokesman
George Cathcart.
" Fhe university will take very seriously
any actions by students that are illegal,"
Cathcart said.
