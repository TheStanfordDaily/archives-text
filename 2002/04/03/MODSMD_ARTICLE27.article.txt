# Jordon posts career-low points and minutes in loss to Lakers
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
boxscore will show that Michael
Jordan scored a career-low two
points in a career-low 12 minutes,
and that's not the worst of it.
Jordan also had a career-low
zero impact in a game in which he
played. He was an inconsequential
reserve on the losing side of a rout
as the Los Angeles Lakers over
whelmed his Washington Wizards
113-93 Tuesday night.
"I'm disappointed we didn't
make a game of it," Jordan said.
"In terms of my minutes or my
points, I'm not worried about
that. I'm not chasing anything.
I'm not chasing any stats. Yes, it's
a career-low in minutes. It didn't
make a difference."
Jordan, struggling to regain
his fitness in his seventh game
since the surgery on his right
knee, entered the game late in the
first quarter, was l-for-5 with
three assists and three turnovers
and did not play in the second
half. There wasn't much need:
The game essentially was over by
the end of the first quarter, and
the Wizards play at Milwaukee on
Wednesday in the second of four
games in five nights.
"I talked to Michael at half
time," coach Doug Collins said.
"And I said, 'Michael, we'll see how
the third quarter goes, and if it
looks like we're back into it, then
you'll play. If not, we're going to
get ready to play the rest of the
week.' And, he was in agreement
with that."

Jordan stored fewer than 10
points for the tilth time this season.
I lest ored in single 112 igures only once
in his entire 1 3-year career with the
Chicago Bulls. His previous low
point total was mx in Washington's
108-81 loss at Indiana oil Dee. 27.
"It looked to me he was not
strong on tli.it leg," said Lakers
coach Phil Jackson, who won six ti
tles with Jordan in Chicago, "or as
strong as he'd like to be."
Shaquille ()'Neal had 22 points
and tied a season-high with 18 re
bounds, Kobe Bryant scored all 14
of his points in the first half, and
Derek Fisher and Rick Fox had 15
apiece for the Lakers. Los Angeles,
starting a four-game road trip, re
mained 1 1/2 games behind first
place Sacramento in the Western
Conference. The Kings beat Mem
phis 107-88.
None of the Lakers starters
played more than 33 minutes,
leaving everyone with fresher legs
for Wednesday night's game
against Eastern Conference
leader New Jersey.
"We didn't want to be messing
around with this team," O'Neal
said. "In the past, we had struggles
winning in this building, and we
wanted to take it to them right
away."
Playoff hopes are fading fast for
the Wizards, although they re
mained 2 1/2 games behind
eighth-place Indiana in the East.
The Pacers lost to Boston 105-94.
Richard Hamilton scored 21
points to lead the Wizards. The

113 points was I lit- most allowed by
Washington this season.
Jordan entered the game with
3:17 remaining in the first quarter
and never got in the How of the of
fense, except tor a possession or
two when he played point guard in
the second quarter.
The Wizards had one good
spurt, when Christian Laettner
scored eight points in a 13-0 run to
give Washington a 15-10 lead. The
Lakers responded with a 17-2 run
— with Fox, Fisher and Bryant
each contributing at least two bas
kets — and the game was over.
Bryant had a variety pack of
three breakaway dunks in the first
half, each one with a different
style. The best was a flying one
handed jam after he stole the ball
from Hamilton.
The lead was 37-24 after the
first quarter and 66-49 at half
time. Bryant had 14 points in the
half and O'Neal had 13 rebounds
to compensate for his 3-for-10
shooting.
The Wizards never got closer
than 14 in the second half. Jor
dan sat pensively at the far end of
the bench and never got up to
ride his exercise bicycle in the
tunnel, his usual warm-up rou
tine before entering a game.
"We were overwhelmed by a
great team," Collins said. "This
team is priming itself to three
peat, and they look awfully darn
good. We just couldn't match
their firepower. They beat us in
every way."

I lest ored in single 112 igures only once
in his entire 1 3-year career with the
Chicago Bulls. His previous low

108-81 loss at Indiana oil Dee. 27.
"It looked to me he was not
strong on tli.it leg," said Lakers
coach Phil Jackson, who won six ti
tles with Jordan in Chicago, "or as
strong as he'd like to be."
Shaquille ()'Neal had 22 points
and tied a season-high with 18 re
bounds, Kobe Bryant scored all 14
of his points in the first half, and
Derek Fisher and Rick Fox had 15
apiece for the Lakers. Los Angeles,
starting a four-game road trip, re
mained 1 1/2 games behind first
place Sacramento in the Western
Conference. The Kings beat Mem
phis 107-88.
None of the Lakers starters
played more than 33 minutes,
leaving everyone with fresher legs
for Wednesday night's game
against Eastern Conference
leader New Jersey.
"We didn't want to be messing
around with this team," O'Neal
said. "In the past, we had struggles
winning in this building, and we
wanted to take it to them right
away."
Playoff hopes are fading fast for
the Wizards, although they re
mained 2 1/2 games behind
eighth-place Indiana in the East.
The Pacers lost to Boston 105-94.
Richard Hamilton scored 21
points to lead the Wizards. The

Washington this season.
Jordan entered the game with
3:17 remaining in the first quarter
and never got in the How of the of
fense, except tor a possession or
two when he played point guard in
the second quarter.
The Wizards had one good
spurt, when Christian Laettner
scored eight points in a 13-0 run to
give Washington a 15-10 lead. The
Lakers responded with a 17-2 run
— with Fox, Fisher and Bryant
each contributing at least two bas
kets — and the game was over.
Bryant had a variety pack of
three breakaway dunks in the first
half, each one with a different
style. The best was a flying one
handed jam after he stole the ball
from Hamilton.
The lead was 37-24 after the
first quarter and 66-49 at half
time. Bryant had 14 points in the
half and O'Neal had 13 rebounds
to compensate for his 3-for-10
shooting.
The Wizards never got closer
than 14 in the second half. Jor
dan sat pensively at the far end of
the bench and never got up to
ride his exercise bicycle in the
tunnel, his usual warm-up rou
tine before entering a game.
"We were overwhelmed by a
great team," Collins said. "This
team is priming itself to three
peat, and they look awfully darn
good. We just couldn't match
their firepower. They beat us in
every way."
